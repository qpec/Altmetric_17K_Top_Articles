Introduction
Like the many-headed Hydra in Greek 
mythology, fossil fuel combustion inflicts a 
multitude of serious health and developmental 
harms in children through its emissions of 
toxic particles and gases and carbon dioxide 
(CO2), a co-pollutant that is a major driver 
of climate change. Each of the myriad pollut-
ants released from the burning of fossil fuels 
is capable of exerting multiple and cumulative 
adverse effects, either directly or indirectly. 
The developing fetus and young child, and 
especially the poor, are most vulnerable to 
the impacts of both toxic air pollutants and 
climate change. Were we, like Herakles, to 
succeed in slaying the Hydra, we would reap 
significant benefits for children, including 
fewer cases of preterm births, low birth weight, 
cognitive and behavioral disorders, and asthma 
and other respiratory illness—all of which 
have been linked to toxic air pollutants—as 
well as less heat-related disease, malnutrition, 
infectious disease, physical trauma, mental ill 
health, and respiratory illness related to climate 
change. The benefits would occur immedi-
ately and play out over the long term, because 
 
exposure- 
related damage, disease, or impair-
ment in early life can affect health over the life 
course and even potentially across generations.
The present commentary builds on 
earlier reviews (McMichael et al. 2006; Patz 
et al. 2005; Perera 2014; Schwartz 2004; 
Sheffield and Landrigan 2011; Xu et al. 2012) 
to summarize the current scientific evidence 
regarding the array of current and projected 
health and economic impacts in children from 
air pollution and climate change resulting 
from the burning of fossil fuels. The data alone 
provide a powerful argument for an integrated 
and child-centered air pollution and energy 
policy. However, going beyond the scientific 
and economic arguments, as Pope Francis has 
reminded us in his recent Encyclical “Laudato 
Si’” (Pope Francis 2015), is the powerful 
moral imperative to protect children and the 
less fortunate from toxic pollution and climate 
change. The pope’s message that global capi-
talism, based on the burning of fossil fuels, 
has created unsustainable consumption and 
shocking inequities within and between coun-
tries was also sounded in the recent report of 
the Lancet Commission (Watts et al. 2015). 
By highlighting the disproportionately heavy 
burden that falls on the very young, and 
especially the poor, who are most vulnerable 
to toxic air pollutants, as well as CO2-driven 
climate change from the combustion of coal, 
oil, and natural gas, the large body of evidence 
reviewed here calls for urgent and coordinated 
action to protect children. Figures 1 and 2 
show the multiple combustion-related emis-
sions and their associated impacts on the health 
of children, and hence the scope of the benefits 
that would result from  
decarbonization of 
the economy.
Why the Focus on Early 
Windows of Development?
The developing fetus and young child are 
more biologically and psychologically vulner-
able than adults to the many adverse effects 
of toxic air pollutants and physical trauma, 
psychosocial stress, nutritional deprivation, 
infectious agents, and heat waves associated 
with climate change from fossil fuel combus-
tion. Contributing factors include children’s 
rapid growth, dynamic developmental 
programming vulnerable to dysregulation, 
immature detoxification, immune, and ther-
moregulatory systems, and their dependence 
on adult caretakers (reviewed by Bateson and 
Schwartz 2008; Sheffield and Landrigan 2011; 
Xu et al. 2012). The importance of protec-
tion during these early windows of develop-
ment is indicated by the fact that most of the 
86 billion neurons of the brain are formed 
during the prenatal period (Crelin 1973), and 
the brain, lungs, and immune system continue 
to develop during infancy through age 6 years 
and beyond (WHO 2006). In addition to 
their increased developmental vulnerability, 
children have greater exposure to toxic air 
pollutants than do adults (WHO 2006) and 
require three to four times the amount of food 
on a body weight basis than adults (Xu et al. 
2012). Recent studies demonstrate that the 
fetal period and early childhood represent 
windows of susceptibility both to genetic 
damage (Perera et al. 2004) and epigenetic 
dysregulation from exposure to xenobiotics 
and stress (Dolinoy et al. 2007), with potential 
lifelong and transgenerational consequences 
(Heindel 2005).
The statistics attest to the differential 
vulnerability of the young and disadvantaged. 
According to the World Health Organization 
(WHO), one-third of the existing global 
burden of disease is caused by environmental

Multiple Threats to Child Health from Fossil Fuel Combustion: Impacts of 
Air Pollution and Climate Change
Frederica P. Perera
Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health, Environmental Health Sciences, Columbia University Mailman School of Public 
Health, New York, New York
Background: Approaches to estimating and addressing the risk to children from fossil fuel 
combustion have been fragmented, tending to focus either on the toxic air emissions or on climate 
change. Yet developing children, and especially poor children, now bear a disproportionate burden 
of disease from both environmental pollution and climate change due to fossil fuel combustion.
oBjective: This commentary summarizes the robust scientific evidence regarding the multiple 
current and projected health impacts of fossil fuel combustion on the young to make the case for 
a holistic, child-centered energy and climate policy that addresses the full array of physical and 
psychosocial stressors resulting from fossil fuel pollution.
discussion: The data summarized here show that by sharply reducing our dependence on fossil 
fuels we would achieve highly significant health and economic benefits for our children and 
their future. These benefits would occur immediately and also play out over the life course and 
potentially across generations.
conclusion: Going beyond the powerful scientific and economic arguments for urgent action to reduce 
the burning of fossil fuels is the strong moral imperative to protect our most vulnerable populations.

factors: More than 40% of that burden is 
borne by children < 5 years of age, although 
they constitute only 10% of the global popu-
lation (Smith et al. 1999; WHO 2002). 
Similarly, > 88% of the existing global burden 
of disease due to climate change also falls 
on children (Zhang et al. 2007), mainly in 
developing countries and populations of low 
socioeconomic status worldwide.
Air pollution and climate change dispro-
portionally affect children in low income 
populations, both in the United States and 
globally (IPCC 2014a; Morello-Frosch et al. 
2011). For example, low-income communi-
ties and communities of color in the United 
States have disproportionately high exposure to 
particulate air pollution and air pollution from 
coal-fired power plants (Bell and Ebisu 2012; 
Earthjustice 2011). In developing countries as 
well, there is a notable pattern of dispropor-
tionate exposure of the poor to air pollution 
(Mehta et al. 2014). Low-income populations 
are also most affected by climate change (Lynn 
et al. 2011; Stiglitz 2007). They often live 
in marginal areas most affected by floods or 
droughts. The effects of toxic exposures and 
climate change are magnified by inadequate 
nutrition, lack of adequate social support, and 
psychosocial stress due to poverty or racism 
(Wood 2003). The numbers of children living 
in poverty are staggering: 1.9 billion, of the 
total world population of 7 billion, are children 
< 15 years of age; and 1 billion of them are 
living in poverty (UNICEF 2015a). In the 
world’s most prosperous country, the United 
States, the child poverty rate is 22% (Annie 
E. Casey Foundation 2015). The striking 
socioeconomic inequalities that now exist in 
children’s health within and between coun-
tries will continue to grow under the projected 
trajectory of global fossil fuel consumption and 
climate change (Costello et al. 2009).
Health and Developmental 
Impacts of Air Toxics
Fossil fuel combustion (coal, diesel fuel, 
gasoline, oil, and natural gas) for electricity 
production, heating, transportation, and 
industry is the main source of air pollution 
(U.S. EPA 2016). In 2011, globally, fossil 
fuels represented 82% of the total primary 
energy supply (World Energy Council 2013). 
In the United States, oil, natural gas, and coal 
account for 81% of current fuel use nation-
ally (U.S. Energy Information Administration 
2014). Frequently treated as a sidebar or 
“co-benefit” in articles on the mitigation of 
climate change, the burden of disease and 
impairment from air pollution is huge and 
increasing. The WHO reports that air pollu-
tion is the number one environmental health 
risk. In 2012, about 3.7 million deaths were 
attributable to ambient air pollution and 
4.3 million deaths to household air pollution 
generated by indoor use of solid fuels (wood, 
charcoal, coal, crop wastes and dung) for 
cooking and heating (WHO 2016). The 
cumulative toll in terms of illness and impair-
ment is likely to be even greater. Children 
represent the subgroup of the population 
most affected by air pollution and will be the 
primary beneficiaries of policies to reduce 
fossil fuel emissions over the next two decades 
(Cifuentes et al. 2001).
The emissions from the burning of fossil 
fuels include directly emitted fine particulate 
matter (PM), black carbon, polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs), mercury, nitrogen 
dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and 
carbon monoxide (CO), all of which have been 
associated with multiple health impacts. Sulfate 
and nitrates are secondarily formed from their 
respective gases and augment directly emitted 
fine PM. Ozone (O3) is created by photo-
chemical reactions in the presence of sunlight 
involving its precursors—volatile organic 
chemicals (VOCs), CO, and NO2—reactions 
that are accelerated at higher temperatures. The 
best studied pollutants include deeply respi-
rable particles having an aerodynamic diameter 
of ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5), PAHs, which are a 
class of hazardous air pollutants that includes 
known carcinogens and neurotoxicants, and 
O3, a strong respiratory irritant. Also emitted 
(but omitted here because of length limits) 
from burning or evaporation of fossil fuels 
are metals such as mercury and VOCs such 
as benzene. Most PM2.5, PAHs, and O3 and 
their precursors are emitted to the outdoor 
air; however, small particles and gases are able 
to penetrate from the outdoor into the indoor 
environment. Indoor sources include stoves 
and furnaces used for cooking and heating.
Early-life exposures to traffic-related 
pollution, PM2.5, PAHs, and O3 are asso-
ciated with a multiplicity of effects on the

 Threats to child health from fossil fuel combustion

developing fetus and child, which can have 
long-term consequences for child health.
Adverse Birth Outcomes
Exposure to air pollutants is associated with 
low or reduced birth weight, small size for 
gestational age (SGA), and preterm birth 
(Choi et al. 2006; Ritz and Wilhelm 2008b). 
Black women exposed to particulate pollution 
had the greatest odds for all of the morbidity 
outcomes, most pronounced for very low birth 
weight (Salihu et al. 2012). Preterm birth and 
low birth weight are known risk factors for 
an array of neurodevelopmental disorders in 
children (Morse et al. 2009). Although the 
increases in risk from air pollution are gener-
ally modest (10–30% for preterm birth and 
low birth weight and between 5% and 20% 
for infant mortality) (Ritz and Wilhelm 
2008a), the population exposed is very large 
(about 62 million women of reproductive age 
in the United States and 1.55 billion world-
wide). In one of the few “natural experiments” 
tracking the health benefits of reducing air 
pollution, during the period when the Utah 
Valley Steel Mill closed down (August 1986–
September 1987), particulate air pollution 
levels (measured as PM10; PM ≤ 10 μm) 
were reduced significantly (Pope 1996), and 
mothers who were pregnant around the time 
of the closure of the mill were less likely to 
deliver prematurely than mothers who 
were pregnant before or after (reviewed by 
Parker et al. 2008). The known or suspected 
mechanisms involved are reviewed elsewhere 
(Proietti et al. 2013).
Respiratory Effects
In many studies, exposure to air pollutants, 
including PM2.5, O3, and NO2, in child-
hood has been clearly linked to reduced lung 
function. For example, a prospective study 
of almost 2,000 schoolchildren found that 
children exposed to higher levels of air pollu-
tion, including NO2 and PM2.5, had signifi-
cantly lower lung function growth at 18 years 
of age, an age when the lungs are nearly mature 
and lung function deficits are unlikely to be 
reversed. Study children who had moved 
to new communities with lower particulate 
matter levels had increased growth in lung 
function, whereas subjects who had moved to 
communities with higher levels of particulate 
matter showed decreased lung function growth 
(Avol et al. 2001).
Exposures to ambient air pollution or 
traffic-related air pollution (O3, particulate 
matter, SO2, and/or NO2) are also well 
documented to exacerbate asthma in children 
(Tzivian 2011) and increase airway oxidative 
stress and airway inflammation in asthmatic 
children (Gasana et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2004; 
Li et al. 2012). Some studies have suggested a 
role of prenatal or early postnatal air pollution 
exposure in the development of asthma (Jung 
et al. 2012; Kim and American Academy 
of Pediatrics Committee on Environmental 
Health 2004). Prenatal or postnatal exposure 
to PAHs has been associated with decreased 
lung function in asthmatic children, asthma 
exacerbation, and possibly the onset of asthma 
itself (reviewed by Karimi et al. 2015). Long-
term exposure to O3 is associated with deficits 
in lung function growth among school-
children (Rojas-Martinez et al. 2007), the 
prevalence of wheeze and allergic rhinitis, and 
the rate of newly developed sensitization to 
outdoor allergens (Kim et al. 2011).
Providing evidence of causality, during the 
Utah Valley Steel Mill closure, local improve-
ments in respiratory disease (bronchitis 
and asthma), related hospital admissions, 
mortality, and school absenteeism paralleled 
the reduction in PM loadings (Pope 1989). 
Similarly, declining levels of NO2 and PM2.5, 
as a result of implementation of air quality–
control policies in Southern California over a 
13-year period, were associated with sustained 
improvements in lung function development 
of children over the same period (Gauderman 
et al. 2015). During the 2008 Beijing 
Olympics, when the central government 
temporarily restricted air pollution emissions 
in Beijing, statistically significant 27% and 
25% reductions were observed in the mean 
concentrations of PM2.5 and black carbon, 
respectively (Rich et al. 2012; Wang et al. 
2009), as well as a decrease in acute respiratory 
inflammation in children (Lin et al. 2011). 
The mechanisms by which air pollutants can 
affect children’s respiratory systems have been 
previously reviewed (Auten and Foster 2011; 
Huang et al. 2015; Klingbeil et al. 2014). 
Neurodevelopmental Effects
Data are more limited for neurodevelop-
mental effects than for birth outcomes and 
respiratory illness. However, air pollutants 
have been linked to an array of neurodevel-
opmental disorders in children. For example, 
in our cohort studies in New York City and 
Krakow, Poland, prenatal exposure to PAHs 
was associated with developmental delay, 
reduced IQ, symptoms of anxiety, depression, 
and inattention (Perera et al. 2012), ADHD 
(Perera et al. 2014a), and reductions in brain 
white matter surface in children (Peterson 
et al. 2015). We observed significant inter-
actions between prenatal PAH exposure and 
material hardship on IQ (Vishnevetsky et al. 
2015) and between prenatal PAH exposure 
and maternal demoralization on behavioral 
problems (Perera et al. 2013). Research in 
Tongliang, China, found that, compared with 
a cohort born before the closure of a centrally 
located coal power plant, a cohort conceived 
after plant closure had significantly lower 
cord blood levels of PAH–DNA adducts and 
higher levels of brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor (BDNF), a protein important in early 
brain development (Perera et al. 2008). A 
small study comparing school-age children in 
Mexico City with those in a less-polluted area 
of Mexico found that the cognitive deficits in 
highly exposed children matched the localiza-
tion of the volumetric differences detected in 
the brain (Calderón-Garcidueñas et al. 2011). 
Other studies have linked roadway proxi-
mity or traffic particles to decreased cogni-
tive function (Harris et al. 2015; Suglia et al. 
2008). There is some emerging evidence that 
prenatal exposure to traffic-related air pollut-
ants (Becerra et al. 2013; Volk et al. 2013) 
and PM2.5 (Raz et al. 2015) may be a risk 
factor for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). 
The suggested mechanisms involved in the 
neurotoxicity of air pollutants are reviewed 
elsewhere (Guxens and Sunyer 2012; Perera 
and Herbstman 2011).
In addition, respiratory illness associated 
with exposure to air pollution increases school 
absences, contributing to lower grades and 
test scores.
Finally, although the evidence on child-
hood cancer and air pollution is inconclusive, 
diesel exhaust particles and PAHs are known 
to be carcinogenic (ATSDR 1995). According 
to a recent review, exposure to residential 
traffic postnatally, but not prenatally, is associ-
ated with childhood leukemia (Boothe et al. 
2014). Prenatal exposure to PAHs has been 
linked to chromosomal aberrations, a validated 
biomarker of elevated cancer risk in adults, 
in cord blood of New York City newborns 
(Bocskay et al. 2005).
Health Impacts of Climate 
Change
The largest source of climate-altering green-
house gas emissions (GHG) from human 
activities in the United States and globally is 
combustion of fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, 
gasoline, and diesel) for energy, electricity, 
heat, and transportation. The combustion 
by-product, CO2, is the most important 
GHG. In the United States, coal and natural 
gas are the biggest contributors to carbon 
pollution (one-third of all domestic carbon 
emissions). Methane is second in impor-
tance, released by production of natural gas, 
oil, and coal. Deforestation, agriculture, and 
landfills also produce CO2 and methane. 
Nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases contribute 
a much smaller fraction of GHG (U.S. EPA 
2016). The present atmospheric concentra-
tions of CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide 
are unprecedented in at least 800,000 years 
(IPCC 2014b).
The direct effects of climate change 
include increased illness, injury, and deaths 
from heat stress, floods, drought, and 
increased frequency of intense storms. The 
 Perera

indirect effects are malnutrition and under-
nutrition, the spread of infectious disease 
vectors, food insecurity, illness due to 
increased air pollution and aeroallergens, and 
mental ill health from displacement and social 
and political instability (Perera 2014; Xu et al. 
2012). In addition, population displacement 
from sea-level rise and conflict-associated 
displacement has numerous downstream 
impacts, such as increased rates of sexually 
transmitted infections due to social network 
disruption (McMichael et al. 2012). These 
direct and indirect impacts of climate change 
are compounded by those of air pollution.
Although there are few quantitative 
estimates of the proportion of childhood 
morbidity and mortality due to human-
induced climate change, there is broad scien-
tific agreement that both direct and indirect 
effects of climate change have already taken 
a significant toll on children, and the impacts 
are predicted to increase dramatically unless 
forceful action is taken. Children bearing the 
greatest burden of climate-sensitive diseases 
are those living in regions that have the 
lowest capacity to adapt to risks, but have 
contributed the least in global emissions of 
 
greenhouse gases (UNICEF 2015b).
Malnutrition and Infectious 
Disease
Malnutrition and infectious disease represent 
the largest share of the burden of childhood 
morbidity and mortality attributed to climate 
change. The WHO estimated that climate 
change since the mid-1970s contributed to 
about 5 million lost disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) worldwide in 2000 through 
increases in diseases such as diarrhea, malnu-
trition, and malaria, mainly in children and 
in developing countries (Patz et al. 2005). 
The number of children affected is expected 
to rise to 175 million per year in the next 
several years (Save the Children UK 2007). 
In certain highland areas of Ethiopia and 
Colombia, malaria incidence has increased 
due to warmer temperatures (Siraj et al. 
2014). Salmonella, a food-borne infectious 
disease, has become more prevalent across 
much of continental Europe as a result of 
higher temperatures (Patz et al. 2005). Their 
immature immune systems make children 
more susceptible to infectious disease 
pathogens (e.g., cholera and other diarrheal 
diseases) due to crop and water contamina-
tion from storms and floods. During early 
development, they are also more vulnerable 
to vector-borne diseases (e.g., malaria and 
dengue fever), which are likely to be increased 
in certain regions due to climate change 
(Patz et al. 2005). The Zika virus is the most 
recent addition to this list. Malnutrition 
places the young at further risk of such 
 
infectious diseases.
Physical Trauma and Mental 
Health Impacts
Although no single extreme weather event, 
such as floods, droughts, bushfires, or hurri-
canes and cyclones, can be attributed entirely 
to climate change, there is agreement that the 
continuing patterns of global warming are 
contributing to the intensity and frequency of 
many such events (IPCC 2012; U.S. Global 
Change Research Program 2014). Weather-
related disasters have directly affected an 
estimated 66.5 million children world-wide, 
600,000 of whom died, every year from 
1990 through 2000 (Pronczuk and Surdu 
2008). Drowning is a major cause of fatality 
in children in developing countries. Sea-level 
rise due to global climate warming has 
made coastal storms increasingly dangerous 
for coastal infrastructure and inhabitants. 
According to a recent study, rates of sea-level 
rise between 1993 and 2011 exceeded by 60% 
the highest projections made in 2007 by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) (Rahmstorf et al. 2012). Notable 
extreme weather events include the massive 
flooding across South East Asia in 2011 
(UNICEF 2011) and Hurricane Katrina in 
2005, which forced 1 million people in New 
Orleans from their homes and left 372,000 
children without schools (Save the Children 
UK 2007; UNICEF 2011). 
The psychological and emotional impacts 
of climate change include the acute or trau-
matic effects of extreme weather events and a 
changed environment; threats to emotional 
well-being based on direct experience or 
concern about future risks; chronic social and 
community impacts of heat, drought, migra-
tions, and climate-related conflicts; and stress 
of post-disaster adjustment (Doherty and 
Clayton 2011; Patz et al. 2014). For example, 
high rates of anxiety and depression were 
found among children affected by Hurricane 
Katrina (Save the Children UK 2007). The 
mental health impacts are considered signifi-
cant, but the effects in children as a vulner-
able population have not been adequately 
described (Patz et al. 2014).
Heat-Related Illness
A well-recognized direct effect of climate 
change is an increase in the frequency of 
deadly heat waves, such as that which resulted 
in 22,000–40,000 heat-related deaths in 
Europe in 2003 (Patz et al. 2005). Heat waves 
are predicted to become more frequent and 
severe in cities such as Chicago, Illinois, and 
Paris, France, with large increases predicted 
for western and southern United States and 
the Mediterranean region. New York City and 
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, may have three times 
their current average number of days hotter 
than 32°C (90°F) (Patz et al. 2014). Direct 
effects of heat waves on children include 
hyperthermia, heat stress, renal disease, and 
respiratory illness (Knowlton et al. 2009). 
During a deadly heat wave in California in 
2006, children 0–4 years of age and the elderly 
were at greatest risk, with 2,500 children 
admitted to emergency rooms (Knowlton 
et al. 2009). Increased temperatures in areas of 
decreased precipitation are also resulting in the 
volatilization of persistent organic pollutants 
and pesticides, to which children’s developing 
nervous systems are particularly vulnerable 
(Sheffield and Landrigan 2011).
More Illness from Increased Air 
Pollution and Allergens
An indirect effect of climate change is the 
increase in levels of certain toxic air pollutants. 
There is remarkable synergy between toxic air 
emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and 
climate change, in that higher temperatures 
due to climate change accelerate the formation 
of O3 from its precursors (VOCs, CO, and 
NO2). For example, O3 levels were substan-
tially elevated during the European heatwave 
of summer 2003 (Schär et al. 2004). Climate 
change is predicted to elevate O3 levels over 
large areas in the United States and Europe, 
especially in the summer (Watts et al. 2015). 
Daily average O3 levels have been predicted 
to rise measurably across the eastern United 
States, with an estimated median 4.5% 
increase in summer O3-related deaths from 
climate change in the 2050s, compared with 
the levels of the 1990s (Knowlton et al. 
2004). This seemingly small relative risk 
translates into a substantial attributable risk 
because many millions of adults and children 
are exposed. A median increase of 7.3% in 
summer O3-related emergency department 
visits for asthma in children 0–17 years of age 
is projected for the New York City metro-
politan region by the 2020s (Sheffield et al. 
2011). As reviewed above, in addition to 
increased mortality and asthma exacerbation, 
O3 is associated with decreased lung growth 
and lung function, as well as other respiratory 
problems in children.
Higher temperatures and greater CO2 
concentrations also promote the growth of 
aeroallergens (e.g., pollens such as ragweed and 
mold), leading to more allergic disease and 
asthma in children (Shea et al. 2008). As noted 
earlier, aeroallergens can interact with O3 to 
increase sensitization and allergic asthma. Both 
ambient and indoor air quality are affected by 
these increases due to the easy penetration of 
pollutants into the indoor environment.
Concentrations of air pollutants such 
as PM2.5 are expected to increase because 
of changes in temperature, precipitation 
frequency, and air stagnation due to climate 
change (Watts et al. 2015). In addition, forest 
fires are increased by higher temperatures and 
lower soil moisture due to climate change,

releasing large amounts of particulate matter, 
PAH, and black carbon. Given their small 
size, these pollutants can be transported 
hundreds of miles from their source, poten-
tially exposing large numbers of children. As 
we have seen, these pollutants are associated 
with multiple adverse effects, most immedi-
ately respiratory symptoms, exacerbation of 
asthma, and chronic bronchitis in children 
(Xu et al. 2012).
Finally, both air pollution and climate 
change contribute to social and political insta-
bility. Children’s mental and physical health 
is adversely affected by forced migration 
and population displacement, perpetuating 
poverty and civil unrest in low-income and 
developing countries. These countries already 
bear most of the global burden of poverty and 
childhood disease; and children < 18 years 
represent 50% of their population (Sheffield 
and Landrigan 2011).
Long-Term Health Impacts 
of Prenatal or Childhood 
Exposure to Air Toxics and 
Climate Change
Toxic air pollutants and climate change 
can affect health and functioning over the 
life course by launching a trajectory of 
adverse effects related to the initial physical 
or developmental impairment, and/or by 
“seeding” latent disease that becomes evident 
only in later life. For example, growth and 
developmental delays in utero associated 
with environmental exposures increase the 
risk for neurodevelopmental, respiratory, 
and other health problems in infancy and 
childhood, as well as heart disease, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes 
in adulthood (Ritz and Wilhelm 2008a). 
Prenatal exposure to certain environmental 
agents has also been linked to adult cancer 
(Heindel 2005). Developmental problems 
such as childhood ADHD (attention deficit/
hyperactivity disorder) have been associ-
ated with early-life exposure to air pollution 
(Newman et al. 2013; Perera et al. 2014a). 
These problems may persist into adulthood, 
adversely affecting professional and personal 
life and increasing health care costs for indi-
viduals and families (Harpin 2005). There is 
considerable empirical evidence that early-
childhood exposure to pollution affects not 
only health but also educational attainment 
and test scores (Currie et al. 2014). A reduc-
tion in child IQ can, in turn, have serious 
economic consequences in adulthood: 
Reduced IQ at 5 years of age associated with 
prenatal PAH exposure has been predicted to 
significantly lower lifetime earnings (Perera 
et al. 2014b). The impacts of climate change 
can also play out over a lifetime. For example, 
stunting of children’s bodies and brains due 
to malnutrition during the first 1,000 days 
results in lasting impaired functioning and 
reduced learning (Lake 2012). Early adversity 
and toxic stress are linked to later impair-
ments in learning, behavior, and physical 
and mental well-being (Sandman et al. 2012; 
Shonkoff et al. 2012). This is illustrated by 
the finding that exposure early in pregnancy 
to elevated levels of cortisol, the so-called 
“stress protein,” resulted in significantly lower 
scores on measures of mental development in 
children (Sandman et al. 2012).
There is growing evidence of trans-
generational impacts of early-life exposures 
to air pollutants, nutritional deprivation, and 
stress, possibly via the transmission of epigen-
etic changes (Champagne 2010; Heindel 
2005). In humans, PAH air pollutants from 
the burning of fossil fuels have been shown 
to alter epigenetic marks in newborns, 
potentially affecting the regulation of genes 
involved in disease pathways, which may then 
be inherited transgenerationally (Perera and 
Herbstman 2011).
Economic Benefits of Action
Lacking is a holistic assessment of the 
economic costs of the multiple health impacts 
of fossil fuel combustion on children’s health, 
hence the full economic benefits of action. 
First, estimates have largely been limited to 
a number of selected outcomes, mainly in 
adults, rather than on the multiple impacts 
on children and especially poor children as 
vulnerable populations. Second, a fundamental 
problem has been the lack of standardization 
in methods. For example, a range of economic 
outcomes has been used, such as cost per 
DALY averted, cost per quality-adjusted life 
year (QALY) gained, cost per case averted, cost 
per death averted, net cost or net present value, 
and economic benefits per unit of money 
invested (Hutton and Menne 2014). Further, 
widely varying outcomes, estimates of the value 
of life saved, and economic methods have been 
used, making it difficult to compare results 
among studies (Hutton and Menne 2014). 
For example, the value per life saved and the 
costs of health care in the United States are 
significantly higher than in most other coun-
tries and may not translate to lower-income 
countries. This has led to a patchwork of 
published estimates on air toxics or climate 
change. Despite these limitations, the avail-
able data indicate great economic benefits from 
coordinated reduction of pollution from fossil 
fuel combustion.
To give some examples for the United 
States: The estimated economic cost of preterm 
births attributable to airborne particulate matter 
in the United States in 2010 was $4.33 billion 
(Trasande et al. 2016). The cost of damages 
caused by air pollution in the United States 
was estimated to be at least $131 billion in the 
year 2011, with most of the cost attributable to 
health impacts (Jaramillo and Muller 2016). 
The U.S. EPA estimates the economic value 
of avoided premature deaths and health costs 
(benefits) attributed to the regulation of PM 
and other criteria air pollutants by the U.S. 
Clean Air Amendments will amount to almost 
$2 trillion for the year 2020—an amount that 
dwarfs the direct costs of putting those limits 
into effect ($65 billion) (U.S. EPA 2011).
The estimated monetary cost of the health 
impacts attributable to air pollution from 
existing coal plants in the United States in 2010 
exceeded $100 billion per year (CATF 2010). 
Our study in New York City predicted that the 
increase in lifetime earnings for each cohort of 
newborns born to low-income mothers in New 
York City as a result of IQ gain from a hypoth-
esized modest reduction of ambient PAH 
concentrations of 0.25 ng/m3 was $215 million 
per year (best estimate) (Perera et al. 2014b). 
Others have estimated the proportion of 
childhood illness from toxic environmental 
exposures more generally. In California, the 
environment contributes to an estimated 30% 
of the childhood asthma burden and 15% of 
the childhood cancer burden. Environmentally 
related costs of four childhood health condi-
tions in California amount to $254 million 
every year and $10–13 billion over the lifetime 
of all children born every year (California 
Environmental Health Tracking Program, 
Public Health Institute 2015). Asthma had the 
greatest financial impact on an annual basis, 
costing families and the state > $208 million 
every year (California Environmental 
Health Tracking Program, Public Health 
Institute 2015).
The costs for non-U.S. countries are 
 
similarly large. The approximately 600,000 
premature deaths and the diseases caused 
by air pollution in the WHO European 
Region in 2010 cost European economies an 
estimated US$1.6 trillion in 2010 (WHO 
Regional Office for Europe and OECD 
2015). As recently reviewed in Lancet, the 
estimated cost of ambient air pollution in 
terms of the value of lives lost and ill health 
in OECD (Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development) countries, 
plus India and China, is > US$3.5 trillion 
annually (Watts et al. 2015). The Clean Air 
for Europe (CAFE) Program estimates that 
achieving air quality targets for Europe has 
a benefit–cost ratio of between 6 and 19 
(Hutton and Menne 2014).
The estimated health costs of climate 
change in the United States are also substan-
tial. A recent study reported that six climate 
change–related events in the United States 
between 2000 and 2009 were associated with 
health costs of > $14 billion (95% due to 
premature mortality) and health care costs 
of $740 million (Knowlton et al. 2011). The 
 Perera
146 
volume 125 | number 2 | February 2017 • Environmental Health Perspectives
estimated health benefits from air quality 
improvement, specifically lowered O3 and 
PM2.5 concentrations, under various CO2 
mitigation policies in the United States are 
very large (from $140 to $290 billion), poten-
tially offsetting the cost of U.S. and interna-
tional carbon policies by as much as 10-fold 
(Thompson et al. 2014).
Globally, the WHO estimated that 
climate change contributed to > 150,000 
deaths and 5.5 million lost DALYs in 
2000 alone (McMichael and Butler 2004). 
According to WHO, the estimated cost of 
climate change from deaths and diseases 
such as diarrhea, malnutrition, malaria, and 
heat stress will be US$2–4 billion per year 
by 2030 (WHO 2015). The cost of acute 
and chronic mortality attributed to air pollu-
tion from climate change was estimated at 
€125 billion (US$141 billion) in 2050 for the 
27 European Union (EU) countries (Hutton 
and Menne 2014).
Benefits of action are correspondingly 
large. In the EU, reduced air pollution 
from policies to mitigate climate change 
could deliver benefits valued at €38 billion 
(US$42 billion) each year by 2050 through 
reduced mortality alone; and moving to 
a low-carbon economy could reduce the 
control costs of non-CO2 air pollutants 
by €50 billion (US$56 billion) by 2050 
(Watts et al. 2015). Up to US$230 billion 
of avoided external health costs annually by 
2030 could be accomplished with an increase 
to 36% renewables in global energy consump-
tion by 2030 (Watts et al. 2015). A study in 
Shanghai, China, estimated that, compared 
with the base case scenario, implementa-
tion of various low-carbon energy scenarios 
could bring health benefits worth US$2.6–
6.2 billion (mid-value) in 2020 (Chen et al. 
2007). In Taiyuan, China, policies to reduce 
coal burning emissions were correlated with 
a reduction in the ambient levels of air pollu-
tion and a 57% reduction in DALYs, with 
substantial estimated economic benefits (Tang 
et al. 2014). This summary underscores the 
need for comprehensive economic analyses of 
the full present and future benefits to children 
of reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
Conclusion
A full accounting is needed of the mounting 
health and economic costs of pollution and 
climate change from fossil fuel combustion 
that are borne by children, so as to spur the 
concerted global mitigation efforts required. 
This accounting must address growing 
regional and socioeconomic disparities and 
the escalating threat to future generations. It 
is generally agreed that, unless strong action 
is taken now, our children and their progeny 
will inherit an unsustainable world, lacking 
the necessary ecological resources and services 
to support them (Yohe et al. 2007). The data 
reviewed here call for a harmonized clean air 
and climate change policy (Thurston 2013) 
that addresses the biological vulnerability of 
the young to the full array of physical and 
psychosocial stressors resulting from pollu-
tion from fossil fuels. The politically powerful 
value of protecting the health and well-being 
of present and future children is shared by 
all cultures and communities (Schene 1998; 
United Nations World Commission on 
Environment and Development 1987) and 
provides a strong lever for action.
