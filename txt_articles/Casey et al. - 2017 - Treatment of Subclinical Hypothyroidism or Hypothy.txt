Abstract
BACKGROUND—Subclinical thyroid disease during pregnancy may be associated with adverse 
outcomes, including a lower-than-normal IQ in offspring. It is unknown whether levothyroxine 
treatment of women who are identified as having subclinical hypothyroidism or hypothyroxinemia 
during pregnancy improves cognitive function in their children.
METHODS—We screened women with a singleton pregnancy before 20 weeks of gestation for 
subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as a thyrotropin level of 4.00 mU or more per liter and a 
normal free thyroxine (T4) level (0.86 to 1.90 ng per deciliter [11 to 24 pmol per liter]), and for 
hypothyroxinemia, defined as a normal thyrotropin level (0.08 to 3.99 mU per liter) and a low free 
T4 level (<0.86 ng per deciliter). In separate trials for the two conditions, women were randomly 
assigned to receive levothyroxine or placebo. Thyroid function was assessed monthly, and the 
levothyroxine dose was adjusted to attain a normal thyrotropin or free T4 level (depending on the 
trial), with sham adjustments for placebo. Children underwent annual developmental and 
behavioral testing for 5 years. The primary outcome was the IQ score at 5 years of age (or at 3 
years of age if the 5-year examination was missing) or death at an age of less than 3 years.
RESULTS—A total of 677 women with subclinical hypothyroidism underwent randomization at 
a mean of 16.7 weeks of gestation, and 526 with hypothyroxinemia at a mean of 17.8 weeks of 
gestation. In the subclinical hypothyroidism trial, the median IQ score of the children was 97 (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 94 to 99) in the levothyroxine group and 94 (95% CI, 92 to 96) in the 
placebo group (P = 0.71). In the hypothyroxinemia trial, the median IQ score was 94 (95% CI, 91 
to 95) in the levothyroxine group and 91 (95% CI, 89 to 93) in the placebo group (P = 0.30). In 
each trial, IQ scores were missing for 4% of the children. There were no significant between-
group differences in either trial in any other neurocognitive or pregnancy outcomes or in the 
incidence of adverse events, which was low in both groups.

 CONCLUSIONS—Treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism or hypothyroxinemia beginning 
between 8 and 20 weeks of gestation did not result in significantly better cognitive outcomes in 
children through 5 years of age than no treatment for those conditions.
Observational studies spanning almost three decades suggest that subclinical thyroid disease 
during pregnancy is associated with adverse outcomes.1–5 In 1999, interest in undiagnosed 
maternal thyroid dysfunction was heightened by studies suggesting an association between 
subclinical thyroid hypofunction and impaired fetal neuropsychological development.6,7 In 
one report, children of women whose serum thyrotropin levels during pregnancy were 
greater than the 98th percentile had a lower IQ than children of matched controls who had a 
normal thyrotropin level.6 In another study, children whose mothers had a serum free 
thyroxine (T4) level of less than the 10th percentile in early pregnancy had impaired 
psychomotor development at 10 months of age, as compared with children whose mothers 
had a higher free T4 level.7 Subclinical hypothyroidism has also been associated with 
increased risks of preterm birth, placental abruption, admission to the intensive care nursery 
(or neonatal intensive care unit), and other adverse pregnancy outcomes that could explain 
neurodevelopmental delay.8–11 However, the risks of these adverse outcomes are not 
increased among women with hypothyroxinemia in pregnancy.12,13
These findings led several professional organizations to recommend routine prenatal 
screening for and treatment of subclinical thyroid disease during pregnancy.14 This 
recommendation could affect more than 15% of pregnant women, depending on the 
thyrotropin and free T4 thresholds used.15 However, the American College of Obstetricians 
and Gynecologists has maintained that recommendations for routine screening are premature 
in the absence of trials showing an improvement in these outcomes with levothyroxine 
treatment.16 The Controlled Antenatal Thyroid Screening (CATS) study showed that 
cognitive function in 3-year-old children was not better than that in controls when mothers 
who had been identified with subclinical hypothyroidism or hypothyroxinemia were treated 
with levothyroxine.17 Despite this evidence, the treatment of subclinical thyroid dysfunction 
is still recommended by several organizations in their clinical practice guidelines.18,19 The 
primary objective of our trials involving women with either subclinical hypothyroidism or 
hypothyroxinemia was to assess the effect of screening and thyroxine replacement during 
pregnancy on the IQ of children at 5 years of age.
METHODS
STUDY POPULATION
We conducted two multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in parallel at 15 
centers within the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human 
Development Maternal–Fetal Medicine Units Network. The protocol, available with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org, was approved by the institutional review board at each 
center. All the women with a singleton pregnancy who presented for prenatal care before 20 
weeks of gestation were invited to undergo thyroid screening for serum thyrotropin and free 
T4 values. The serum samples obtained from women who provided written informed consent 
were analyzed at a centralized laboratory (see the Supplementary Appendix, available at 
NEJM.org).

 The criteria that were used to diagnose subclinical hypothyroidism at the origin of the trial 
were a thyrotropin level of 3.00 mU or more per liter (which was presumed to correspond to 
the 97.5th percentile) and a free T4 level in the normal range (0.86 to 1.90 ng per deciliter 
[11 to 24 pmol per liter]). After 10 months of screening, during a planned evaluation, the 
prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism was found to exceed 6%. On the basis of an 
analysis of the 97.5th percentile in the first 15,000 women who underwent screening, the 
cutoff for the thyrotropin level was subsequently increased to 4.00 mU per liter. 
Hypothyroxinemia was defined as a thyrotropin level in the normal range (0.08 to 3.99 mU 
per liter) and a free T4 level of less than 0.86 ng per deciliter.
Women with either subclinical hypothyroidism or hypothyroxinemia and an 
ultrasonographically verified singleton pregnancy between 8 weeks 0 days of gestation and 
20 weeks 6 days of gestation met the inclusion criteria. The complete eligibility criteria are 
listed in the Supplementary Appendix. Women who were found to have overt 
hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism at the time of screening were excluded, and obstetrical 
providers were notified of abnormal test results for subsequent follow-up.
TRIAL REGIMENS
Eligible women who provided written informed consent were given a 7-day supply of 
placebo capsules (adherence run-in phase). Women who took 50% or more of the capsules 
and returned within 2 weeks were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either 
levothyroxine or placebo in one of two trials, the subclinical hypothyroidism trial or the 
hypothyroxinemia trial, according to their results on the thyrotropin and free T4 tests. 
Separate randomization sequences were prepared at the independent data coordinating 
center with the use of the simple urn method,20 with stratification according to clinical site. 
Numbered trial-regimen kits were prepared, and at randomization, each patient was assigned 
to the next sequentially numbered kit. Blood and urine samples were obtained from all the 
participants for analysis, at the central laboratory, of thyroid peroxidase antibodies and 
urinary iodine concentration.
Participants with subclinical hypothyroidism began taking 100 μg of levothyroxine or 
matching placebo daily. Participants with hypothyroxinemia began taking 50 μg of 
levothyroxine or matching placebo daily; the lower dose in the hypothyroxinemia trial was 
intended to avoid overtreatment in women with mild suppression of free T4 at trial entry. 
Women in the two trials were seen monthly, and blood samples for thyrotropin and free T4 
testing were sent to the same laboratory. Results were reported to the coordinating center, 
which notified the clinical center whether a dose adjustment was required according to the 
algorithm shown in Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix. Sham adjustments were 
communicated for the placebo group. Adjustments were made within 7 days after the blood 
test. The goal for women with subclinical hypothyroidism was a thyrotropin level between 
0.1 and 2.5 mU per liter, with a maximum daily dose of 200 μg of levothyroxine. The goal 
for participants with hypothyroxinemia was a free T4 level between 0.86 and 1.90 ng per 
deciliter, with the same maximum dose of levothyroxine.
Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes were abstracted from the medical records by certified 
research staff. The children underwent developmental testing annually for 5 years.

 Examiners were trained to administer each test, and they submitted a videotaped encounter 
to two expert psychologists for initial certification. Annual re-certification was required. 
Research staff, examiners, and participants were unaware of the trial-group assignments.
TRIAL OUTCOMES
The primary outcome was the full-scale IQ as assessed with the use of the Wechsler 
Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence III (WPPSI-III) at 5 years of age, or with the 
overall (general conceptual ability) score from the Differential Ability Scales–II (DAS) at 3 
years of age if the WPPSI-III score was not available, or death before 3 years of age 
(because it was a competing event for IQ score). Results are expressed as age-standardized 
scores, with an expected population mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. The DAS 
and WPPSI-III scores correlate well (r = 0.89). Prespecified subgroup analyses for the 
primary outcome were performed according to gestational age at randomization, race or 
ethnic group, and baseline thyroid peroxidase antibody, thyrotropin, free T4, and iodine 
levels.
Secondary outcomes in infants and children included the cognitive, motor, and language 
scores on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Third Edition (Bayley-III), at 12 months 
and 24 months of corrected age; DAS overall scores at 36 months of age; specific scores on 
the DAS (subtests regarding recall of digits forward and recognition of pictures) plus the 
Conners’ Rating Scales–Revised at 48 months of age for assessment of attention; and scores 
on the Child Behavior Checklist at 36 months and 60 months of age for assessment of 
behavioral and social competency. Maternal and neonatal secondary outcomes included 
preterm delivery, pregnancy complications, fetal death, and neonatal morbidity and 
mortality. A complete list of secondary outcomes is provided in the Supplementary 
Appendix.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Assuming an analysis that would be based on a Wilcoxon test with a 5-point difference 
between the group median IQ scores, a death rate before the age of 3 years (including 
spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and neonatal and infant deaths) of 2 to 5%, and 15% loss 
to follow-up, we initially calculated that a sample of 500 patients in each trial (250 women 
per group) would provide the trial with a power of at least 80%, at a two-sided type I error 
rate of 5%. When the eligibility criteria for the subclinical hypothyroidism trial changed, the 
sample was adjusted to 670 participants under the assumption that there would be no 
between-group difference in the children’s IQ scores if the mothers’ thyrotropin levels were 
between 3.00 and 4.00 mU per liter, but there would be a between-group difference of 5 
points if the mothers’ thyrotropin levels were 4.00 mU or more per liter.
The analysis was performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. The primary 
outcome and other continuous variables were compared with the use of the Wilcoxon test or 
van Elteren’s test for stratified analysis. For the primary outcome, death before 3 years of 
age was assigned a score of 0 (lowest possible rank) and was included in the estimation of 
the median. Differences between groups were estimated with the use of the Hodges–
Lehmann estimator, and 95% confidence intervals were reported. Categorical variables were

 analyzed with the use of the chisquare test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. To test for 
interaction in the prespecified subgroup analyses, we used regression with normal-order 
scores.
An independent data and safety monitoring committee monitored the trials. Since 
recruitment was completed before any 5-year outcomes were available, there was no interim 
analysis of the primary outcome. For secondary outcomes, nominal P values of less than 
0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. No adjustments were made for 
multiple comparisons.
RESULTS
TRIAL POPULATIONS
From October 2006 through October 2009, a total of 97,228 pregnant women underwent 
thyroid screening. A total of 90,417 women (93%) had results that were considered to be 
normal, 463 (<1%; prevalence, 5 cases per 1000 pregnant women) had overt 
hypothyroidism, and 250 (<1%; prevalence, 3 cases per 1000 pregnant women) had overt 
hyperthyroidism. Of the 3057 women (3%) with subclinical hypothyroidism, 800 were 
eligible and consented to participate in the adherence run-in phase, and 677 underwent 
randomization. Of the 2805 women (3%) with hypothyroxinemia, 632 were eligible and 
consented to participate in the adherence run-in phase, and 526 underwent randomization 
(Fig. 1). IQ scores were not available for 4% of the offspring in each trial (28 offspring in 
the subclinical hypothyroidism trial and 19 in the hypothyroxinemia trial).
There were no significant differences at baseline between the levothyroxine group and the 
placebo group in either trial (Table 1). The population in each trial was iodine-sufficient 
(median urinary iodine concentration, ≥150 μg per liter).21 On average, women in the 
subclinical hypothyroidism trial underwent randomization before 17 weeks of gestation, and 
93% of the women in the levothyroxine group had a thyrotropin level between 0.1 and 2.5 
mU per liter by a median gestational age of 21 weeks. In the hypothyroxinemia trial, women 
underwent randomization at a mean gestational age of 18 weeks, and 83% of the women in 
the levothyroxine group met the treatment goal (free T4 level between 0.86 and 1.90 ng per 
deciliter) by a median gestational age of 23 weeks.
PREGNANCY AND NEONATAL OUTCOMES
The frequencies of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes did not differ significantly 
between the groups in either trial (Table 2). After neonatal discharge, there was one death in 
the subclinical hypothyroidism trial and none in the hypothyroxinemia trial. Two women 
were lost to follow-up before delivery. There was no significant difference between the 
levothyroxine group and the placebo group in either trial with regard to the mean gestational 
age at delivery (subclinical hypothyroidism trial: 39.1±2.5 weeks and 38.9±3.1 weeks, 
respectively; P = 0.57; and hypothyroxinemia trial: 39.0±2.4 weeks and 38.8±3.1 weeks, 
respectively; P = 0.46). There were no significant differences in overall or serious adverse 
events between the two groups in either trial; serious adverse events were rare in the two 
trials (Tables S4 and S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).

 NEURODEVELOPMENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES
In the subclinical hypothyroidism trial, data on the primary outcome were available for 649 
off-spring (96%) (Table 3). A total of 11 children had DAS scores at 3 years that were 
substituted for the WPPSI-III IQ score, and 13 offspring died before 3 years of age (fetal 
death, neonatal death, or infant death), including 4 in the levothyroxine group and 9 in the 
placebo group (P = 0.16). The median IQ score was 97 (95% confidence interval [CI], 94 to 
99) in the levothyroxine group and 94 (95% CI, 92 to 96) in the placebo group (P = 0.71). 
Annual developmental-testing scores and the results of the behavioral and attention 
assessments (the Child Behavior Checklist and Connors’ Rating Scales–Revised, 
respectively) did not differ significantly between the groups for any test.
In the hypothyroxinemia trial, data on the primary outcome were available for 507 off-spring 
(96%) (Table 4). A total of 12 children had a DAS score substituted for the WPPSI-III IQ 
score, and 9 offspring died before 3 years of age, including 3 in the levothyroxine group and 
6 in the placebo group (P = 0.34). The median IQ score was 94 (95% CI, 91 to 95) in the 
levothyroxine group and 91 (95% CI, 89 to 93) in the placebo group (P = 0.30). There were 
no significant between-group differences in any of the annual measures.
The median T scores for the Child Behavior Checklist and the Conners’ Rating Scales–
Revised in all comparison groups (in the two trials) were within the normal range.22,23 None 
of the sub-group interaction tests were significant (Table S6 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Stratification according to clinical center did not materially alter the results in 
either trial.
DISCUSSION
These two parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled trials involving women with subclinical 
hypothyroidism or hypothyroxinemia in the first half of pregnancy showed no significant 
effect of thyroid hormone–replacement therapy on the cognitive function of the children or 
on other indexes of neurodevelopment through 5 years of age. There were no significant 
differences in measures of behavior, attention deficits, or hyperactivity in either trial. 
Moreover, treatment of women who had either an elevated thyrotropin level or a low free T4 
level had no significant effect on pregnancy or neonatal outcomes.
A previous study indicated that children who were born to untreated women who had a 
thyrotropin value above the 98th percentile had diminished school performance and an 
average IQ that was 7 points lower than the average IQ of control children.6 These results 
are often offered as evidence that the offspring of women with subclinical hypothyroidism 
during pregnancy are at risk for subnormal brain function. However, most women who were 
included in this previous study had a thyrotropin level greater than 10 mU per liter and a free 
T4 level that was more consistent with the diagnosis of overt hypothyroidism.6 Studies 
involving children of women with hypothyroxinemia that was identified before 12 weeks of 
gestation also showed significantly lower scores on the Bayley mental and psychomotor 
subscales at 2 years of age than infants of euthyroid women. 7,24 These studies suggested 
that offspring would benefit from maternal treatment for subclinical thyroid disease and

 resulted in recommendations by some medical organizations for routine maternal screening 
and treatment to prevent subnormal cognitive development in offspring.14
The results of our trials are consistent with those of the CATS study, which was a thyroid-
screening trial involving 21,846 pregnant women, primarily from the United Kingdom. 
Women in that trial were either screened immediately and treated with levothyroxine if they 
were identified as having subclinical hypothyroidism or hypothyroxinemia or had their 
serum frozen to be analyzed on completion of the pregnancy. The results of IQ testing of the 
children at 3 years of age did not differ significantly between children whose mothers had 
been immediately treated during the pregnancy and those whose mothers had treatment that 
was deferred. Thyroid hormone–replacement therapy in the CATS study was initiated at a 
median gestational age of 13 weeks 3 days, as compared with 16 weeks 4 days and 18 weeks 
in our two trials.17 However, 24% of the children in the CATS study were lost to follow-up. 
In the current trials, the follow-up rate at 5 years of age was more than 92%.
Several studies have also suggested that either a high maternal thyrotropin level or 
hypothyroxinemia is associated with externalizing behavioral problems such as attention 
deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).25,26 In the Generation R Study, 8-year-old children 
of women from an iodine-deficient geographic area who had been identified with 
hypothyroxinemia before 20 weeks of gestation were found to have higher ADHD index 
scores than children of women without hypothyroxinemia.26 This association persisted after 
adjustment for IQ. We did not identify any significant between-group differences in ADHD 
index scores in either of our trials, and the scores were well within the normal range. 
Moreover, the Child Behavior Checklist scores did not reveal any evidence of behavioral 
problems in children whose mothers with subclinical hypothyroidism or hypothyroxinemia 
were in the placebo group. The CATS study also did not detect any behavioral improvements 
in children who had been exposed to thyroid hormone replacement.17
Subclinical hypothyroidism has been associated with several obstetrical complications,8–11 
but there has been no direct evidence that levothyroxine therapy reduces these risks.19 One 
study involving women with thyroid peroxidase antibodies showed a lower rate of preterm 
delivery among women treated with levothyroxine during pregnancy than among those who 
were untreated27; however, these women had normal thyroid-function tests. We did not 
detect any significant improvement in pregnancy or neonatal outcomes that was associated 
with levothyroxine therapy in women with subclinical thyroid hypofunction.
A limitation of the two trials is the relatively late time during gestation at which women 
were randomly assigned to the trial groups. The fetal thyroid gland begins producing thyroid 
hormone between 10 weeks and 12 weeks of gestation, and on average, women underwent 
randomization in our trials several weeks after this time (at a mean of 16.7 weeks of 
gestation in mothers with subclinical hypothyroidism and 17.8 weeks of gestation in those 
with hypothyroxinemia). However, in a previous study, a small cohort of children whose 
mothers had a low free T4 level in the first trimester but whose level increased before 24 
weeks of gestation had scores that were similar to those of children of euthyroid mothers, 
which suggests a possible benefit with the initiation of supplementation after the first 
trimester.24

 In our trials, the mothers who were treated with levothyroxine met therapy goals by a 
median gestational age of less than 24 weeks. We also found no significant interaction 
according to the time of initiation of therapy (<17 weeks of gestation vs. ≥17 weeks of 
gestation). Furthermore, post hoc analyses of the CATS study did not suggest any significant 
differences in IQ scores between the treated group and the control group among women who 
were screened before 14 weeks of gestation or who met the target thyrotropin levels within 6 
weeks after screening.17 Although we did not enroll women earlier than at 8 weeks of 
gestation in order to avoid enrolling women who might have an early miscarriage, we 
believe that these trials, which were performed at centers that were actively screening 
women on presentation for prenatal care, probably reflect what could be accomplished by 
means of routine thyroid screening during pregnancy in the United States.
In conclusion, on the basis of a comprehensive battery of tests through 5 years of age, we 
did not find significantly better neurodevelopmental outcomes in children whose mothers 
had received thyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism or hypothyroxinemia 
during pregnancy than in children whose mothers did not receive such treatment. Our trials 
also showed no significant effect of thyroxine treatment on pregnancy and neonatal 
outcomes.

*Plus–minus values are means ±SD. NICU denotes neonatal intensive care unit.
†Analyses of neonatal outcomes of the respiratory distress syndrome, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia did not include stillbirths or miscarriages in the 
levothyroxine group (four offspring) or the placebo group (seven) in the subclinical hypothyroidism trial or in the levothyroxine group (two) or the placebo group (four) in the hypothyroxinemia trial. One 
infant in the placebo group in the hypothyroxemia trial was born out of network and was also not included in the analyses.
‡The composite neonatal outcome was defined as periventricular leukomalacia, intraventricular hemorrhage of grade III or IV, necrotizing enterocolitis (stage ≥II), severe retinopathy of prematurity (stage 
≥III), the severe respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, neonatal death, stillbirth, or serious infectious complication.

*For all outcomes except the primary outcome, the potential follow-up cohort consisted of 335 children in the levothyroxine group and 329 in the placebo group (offspring who were not lost to follow-up at 
maternal delivery, who were discharged alive after birth, and who did not die before 1 year of age).
†Shown is the Hodges–Lehmann estimate of the absolute difference between the placebo group and the levothyroxine group. The Hodges–Lehmann estimate is the median of all paired differences between 
the observations in the two samples, and negative numbers reflect lower scores in the placebo group.
‡The primary outcome was death or IQ score at 5 years of age (or at 3 years of age if the 5-year examination was missing). The full-scale IQ was assessed with the use of the Wechsler Preschool and 
Primary Scale of Intelligence III (WPPSI-III) at 5 years of age or the overall (general conceptual ability) score from the Differential Ability Scales–II at 3 years of age if the WPPSI-III score was not 
available. Results are expressed as an age-standardized score, with an expected population mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. Death before 3 years of age was assigned a score of 0 (lowest possible 
rank) and was included in the estimation of the median.
§Results on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Third Edition (Bayley-III) are expressed as an age-standardized score, with an expected population mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.
¶A Child Behavior Checklist T score of less than 60 is considered to be in the normal range, a T score of 60 to 63 is a borderline score, and a T score of more than 63 is in the clinical range.17
||The Conners’ Rating Scales–Revised were used to assess attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A T score of 45 to 55 is considered to be typical or average; a T score of 44 or less is not a 
concern, a T score of 56 to 60 is considered to be a borderline score, and a T score of 61 or higher indicates a possible or clinically significant problem.
