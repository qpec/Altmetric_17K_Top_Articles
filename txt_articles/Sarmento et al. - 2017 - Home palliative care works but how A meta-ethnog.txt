and family caregivers

ABSTRACT
Objective To understand patients and family
caregivers’ experiences with home palliative care
services, in order to identify, explore and
integrate the key components of care that shape
the experiences of service users.
Methods We performed a meta-ethnography of
qualitative evidence following PRISMA
recommendations for reporting systematic
reviews. The studies were retrieved in 5
electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE,
PsycInfo, BNI, CINAHL) using 3 terms and its
equivalents (‘Palliative’, ‘Home care’, ‘Qualitative
research’) combined with ‘AND’, complemented
with other search strategies. We included original
qualitative studies exploring experiences of adult
patients and/or their family caregivers (≥18 years)
facing life-limiting diseases with palliative care
needs, being cared for at home by specialist or
intermediate home palliative care services.
Results 28 papers reporting 19 studies were
included, with 814 participants. Of these, 765
were family caregivers and 90% were affected
by advanced cancer. According to participants’
accounts, there are 2 overarching components of
home palliative care: presence (24/7 availability
and home visits) and competence (effective
symptom control and skilful communication),
contributing to meet the core need for security.
Feeling secure is central to the benefits
experienced with each component, allowing
patients and family caregivers to focus on the
dual process of living life and preparing death at
home.
Conclusions Home palliative care teams
improve patients and caregivers experience of
security when facing life-limiting illnesses at
home, by providing competent care and being
present. These teams should therefore be widely
available and empowered with the resources to
be present and provide competent care.
BACKGROUND
Palliative care provides high-quality care
in any setting where patients with life-
threatening illnesses are cared for, being
therefore considered as a human right.1 2
Receiving such care at home, according
to patients and families’ preferences,3
allows people to live in their own envir-
onment, while preserving the best quality
of life possible.4 In the context of ageing
populations with growing palliative care
needs,5 and patients spending the major-
ity of time being cared for at home,6
home care has become a policy priority.7
A Cochrane review8 showed that home
palliative care services help meet prefer-
ences for being cared for at home, by
doubling the odds for death at home
while
decreasing
symptom
burden.
However, this review also found that the
interventions differed considerably in the
23 studies identified. Such variability is
inherent to the nature of a complex inter-
vention such as home palliative care,
which comprises the provision of holistic
care usually by a multidisciplinary team.4
Therefore, the more than 1900 home
palliative care teams existent in European
countries are expected to provide differ-
ent models of care, reflecting complexity
and context diversity.9
In the light of this variability, it is not
well understood how home palliative care
services benefit patients and their fam-
ilies. An integrative review of 17 studies
of family caregivers’ existential concerns
identified
loneliness,
insecurity
and
responsibility as important concerns.10 A

faction

 home palliative care included access to 24/7 support
and symptom control. Evidence from the Cochrane
review on home palliative care8 also suggests that 24/7
availability might be an effective component of home
palliative care.
Synthesising the qualitative evidence of the experi-
ences of patients and family caregivers with home pal-
liative care services will shed light on the role of the
different components of the intervention.12 Albeit
challenging, the identification of these key compo-
nents, together with an understanding of how they
influence the experiences of patients and families,
could be useful to research, by informing the design
of interventions to be tested in the future. It could
also influence clinical practice and health policy, by
shedding light on the minimum standards needed to
provide home palliative care.13–15
In this study, we aimed to understand patients and
family caregivers’ experiences with home palliative
care services in order to:
1. Identify the key components of home palliative care that
shape the experiences of patients and family caregivers;
2. Explore the mechanisms of action of the identified key
components according to patients’ and family caregivers’
experiences;
3. Integrate the findings into a model of patients’ and
family caregivers’ experiences with home palliative care
services.
METHODS
Study design
In order to ensure transparency and identify all rele-
vant studies, we systematically reviewed published and
unpublished literature, following a protocol designed
and piloted by the team (presented as an online
supplementary
file)
and
according
to
PRISMA
recommendations.16
To synthesise the studies, we chose an interpretative
method of analysis in order to understand how home
palliative care services work through the lenses of
patients and caregivers. Meta-ethnography is a system-
atic method for synthesising qualitative evidence, that
was first described by Noblit and Hare,17 in 1988.
Since then, it has been successfully applied onto the
healthcare field.18–20 This method consists of identify-
ing and translating key concepts between studies,
taking into account the context in which these con-
cepts were obtained. At the end of the process, the
meta-ethnographic analysis leads to a reciprocal, refu-
tational and/or lines-of-argument synthesis.17
Given that meta-ethnography is a complex under-
taking, we formed a multidisciplinary team compris-
ing
a
range
of
different
clinical
and
research
experiences, including: a medical doctor with experi-
ence in palliative care research and clinical end-of-life
care (VPS, first reviewer); a senior anthropologist and
palliative care researcher with a background of linguis-
tics and extensive experience in qualitative research
and meta-ethnography (MG, second reviewer); a
senior palliative care researcher with a psychology
background and expertise in home palliative care
research (BG, third reviewer). IJH was involved in the
protocol development and overview of the study.
Identification of studies
Between September and November 2013, we searched
the
five
major
healthcare
bibliographic
databases
(MEDLINE,
EMBASE,
CINAHL,
PsycInfo,
BNI)
using text words and MeSH headings to capture three
term groups (‘Palliative’, ‘Home care’, ‘Qualitative
research’) combined with the operator ‘AND’ (elec-
tronic search strategies are presented in an online
supplementary file). W
e have recorded the search
results in an EndNote file and removed the duplicates.
The identification of qualitative studies through
electronic
search
is
traditionally
challenging.21
Therefore, we complemented our search with other
methods such as: hand-search of relevant publications,
screening of references and citation search of relevant
reviews and included studies, experts consultation and
screening of conference proceedings and abstracts
(non-electronic search strategies are presented in an
online supplementary file).
Selection of studies
W
e considered the studies for inclusion through titles
and abstracts screening, followed by full-text screen-
ing, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria
detailed in table 1. W
e defined family caregivers as
non-paid lay caregivers related by blood or friendship.
Components of care were defined as the elements that
build up a complex intervention, including beha-
viours, parameters of behaviours and methods of
organising
and
delivering
those
behaviours.22
Mechanisms of action refer to how the components
of care relate to each other in order to produce the
outcome (ie, change in status of health and welfare of
individuals or populations confidently attributable to
the antecedent care).22 23 To define home palliative
care and distinguish generalist from intermediate or
specialist services, we applied the criteria used by
Gomes et al8 in the Cochrane review (presented in an
online supplementary file).
When needed, we contacted the authors of poten-
tially relevant studies to ask for missing information.
Finally, we discussed the inclusion of more than 10%
of all full-text screened references within the team.
Quality assessment
To assess the quality of each study, we used a modified
version
of
the
CASP
(Critical
Appraisal
Skills
Programme) criteria, based on the work developed by
Campbell et al19 24 (detailed in the Protocol presented
as online supplementary file). W
e answered the main
CASP questions as yes/partially/no, covering issues
related to methodological clarity, data collection,

 analysis and reporting of results. The first reviewer
performed the quality assessment, reported the results
in
a
table
and
discussed
these
with
the
other
reviewers. W
e did not exclude studies based on their
quality assessment, as there is no evidence that this
improves the quality of the review25 while it may
exclude studies with low reporting quality but relevant
results.19 The results of this appraisal were used to
make sense of the general quality of the studies
included and to identify potential pitfalls in the
reporting that could influence the results of the
review.
Analysis
W
e followed the steps of meta-ethnography described
by Noblit and Hare,17 which involve five interactive
stages:
1. Reading and re-reading the studies, and recording the
following information in a predesigned extraction form,
in a Microsoft Office Excel file: general characteristics,
methods, participants, home palliative care services,
results (themes, quotes and explanatory theories). At this
stage, we concluded that the results of the studies
seemed to agree in the overall understanding of the
experiences of patients and caregivers with home pallia-
tive care services.
2. Through the process described above, we separately
identified key components and experiences, followed by
a discussion among the team. For this step, we used dif-
ferent methods in an interactive way, in order to take
into account the whole of the findings. Hence, we sum-
marised the table developed in the first stage and
mapped the emerging experiences, components of care
and their relationships, aiming to understand how the
results of the studies related to each other.
3. W
e were then able to determine that the studies had
reciprocal (similar) results (in contrast with refutational
findings). At this point, we compared the concepts and
maps obtained by each researcher, and agreed on the
emerging experiences and key components of home pal-
liative care.
4. By going back to the studies and data extraction forms,
we translated the key components and experiences
between the studies, ensuring that no relevant or contra-
dictory findings were being ignored. This translation was
reflected in a reciprocal translation table (presented in
an online supplementary file).
5. After completing the stages above, we discussed the
interpretations entailed in the results of the review. W
e
identified first, second and third-order constructs by
synthesising the reciprocal translation table in a recipro-
cal translation synthesis. A new level of interpretation
was obvious at this point, with all components of care
contributing to and explaining the same experience.
Therefore, we obtained a lines-of-argument synthesis,
which was then represented in a simplified conceptual
model of the experiences of patients and caregivers with
home palliative care.
RESULTS
Identification and selection of studies
W
e identified 4150 papers through the electronic
search and after removing duplicates. From these,
3080 references were excluded in the screening of
titles and abstracts. W
e retrieved the full text of the
1070 remaining references except for seven that we
could not find despite attempts to contact the authors
and the support of the library services. These are pre-
sented in an online supplementary file. From the
remaining 1063 references, 1032 were excluded after
full-text screening, resulting in 40 papers reporting 30
studies, from which 2 studies were identified through
other sources (citation search and reference checking).
W
e then read and re-read all 30 studies several times.
Eleven studies and one paper were excluded at this
phase because: seven studies reported experiences spe-
cifically with generalist home palliative care services;
four studies presented a small amount of relevant
results; one paper was about bereavement support
only. Finally, 28 papers reporting 19 studies were
included (list in an online supplementary file). All
steps of the identification and selection of studies with
reasons for exclusion are presented in a PRISMA flow
chart (see online supplementary file). There was no
specific order to read the studies. Initially, all studies
were analysed to the same extent, and given the same

 importance. In order to ensure trustworthiness, all the
findings reported by the studies were included in the
first stage. Nonetheless, as the review process devel-
oped, some studies were found to present more com-
prehensive
results
that
were
cornerstone
to
the
understanding of the experiences with home palliative
care.
Characteristics of included studies
Table 2 presents the main characteristics of the 19
included studies. Eleven studies were undertaken in
Sweden, four in the UK and one in Denmark. Three
studies were from non-European countries (two from
the USA and one from Australia). The 19 studies
included data collected in semistructured or unstruc-
tured interviews in 14 cases (face-to-face or by tele-
phone)
and
in
5
cases
through
other
methods
(structured questionnaires with open-ended questions
in 4 studies and analysis of a written diary in 1 study).
One of the Swedish studies was a secondary analysis
of data collected in three of the included studies.
Only one study was published before the year 2000
and four were published from 2011 onwards.
The 19 studies included 814 participants from
which the majority were family caregivers (n=765,
94%), whom participated in 17 of the 19 studies.
Three studies alone included more than two-thirds of
all caregivers (n=522, 68%). There was gender infor-
mation for 680 caregivers, from whom 416 were
women (61%). About one-third of participant care-
givers (237) were active carers at the time of the
study, while 528 were bereaved caregivers. From all
patients under home palliative care services (n=801),
724 (90%) suffered from advanced cancer, while 77
(10%) were diagnosed with advanced non-malignant
diseases.
Nine studies sampled participants from specialist
services, two from intermediate services and eight
studies did not provide enough information to make
the distinction between intermediate and specialist
care. All services provided home visits, 16 included
hands-on
practical care, from which
4 provided
advanced technological support (ie, interventions that
are usually seen as institution-delivered, eg, blood
transfusions, syringe drivers). Fifteen studies were
conducted in services with 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week (24/7) availability to be contacted, and seven
visited patients at home out-of-hours (OOH).
Overall, the studies had an acceptable methodo-
logical quality (see table 3), with only one study
meeting less than half of the criteria (study 18—
journal letter) and 12 studies meeting 10 or more
criteria. Less than half of the studies (n=7) had an
identified theoretical framework.
Interestingly, a relationship between the quality of
the studies and the usefulness of their findings to the
review was found. By reporting methods and findings
thoroughly,
and
describing
comprehensively
the
analyses and interpretations, higher quality studies
better enlightened the understanding of experiences
with home palliative care.
Reciprocal comparative synthesis: key components
of home palliative care
W
e found that the results of the studies were recipro-
cally translatable. Although the experiences of patients
and caregivers differed, the same care components
seemed to meet their different needs. Patients and
caregivers worked as dyads, with the suffering of one
increasing the distress of the other.
Four components of the home palliative care teams
contribute decisively to people’s experiences of care:
availability, home visits, effective symptom control
and effective communication skills (second-order con-
structs, table 4), as illustrated by the quote below.
[What were the best aspects of hospital-based [home]
palliative care?] ‘The professionalism including experi-
ence and accessibility 24 hours a day. These two
aspects have equal importance and cannot be ranked’.
(caregiver, study 17)
These components can be grouped according to the
meaning that patients and caregivers assign to them. A
team that was available around the clock to be con-
tacted, and that visited at home, was seen as being
present for support. If the team effectively managed
symptoms and communicated skilfully, it was under-
stood by participants as being competent. Presence
and competence were therefore identified as the
third-order constructs (table 4). This reciprocal trans-
lational synthesis is presented in table 4 with illustrat-
ing quotes.
Presence
The home palliative care teams had a crucial role in
providing a sense of being accompanied instead of
being left alone in the difficult situation of dealing
with an advanced life-limiting disease at home. To
service users, this meant that professional help was
easily accessed and that they were visited at home.
Broadly, a team that was present yielded a sense of
security
and
facilitated
management
of
care
at
home.
When being able to get support by the team 24/7,
patients and caregivers’ experience of security at
home was enabled, as this meant that there was always
someone knowledgeable available to give advice, who
represented a better alternative than other immediate
support (eg, calling an ambulance).
This availability decreased the uncertainty of the
situation and facilitated trust in the team’s competence
and resources to meet their needs (table 4, Q1–Q4).
OOH support could be exclusively telephonic or
include availability for home visits if needed, though
it was unclear if the experience of security was any
different with these two models.

 When visiting at home, palliative care professionals
relieved caregivers from responsibility, by providing
an assessment of the patient’s situation and helping
with decision-making, but also by helping with prac-
tical hands-on care (table 4, Q5–Q9). When the team
had the resources to provide advanced technological
support at home, hospital visits were avoided and feel-
ings of security were enhanced. Home visits were also
seen as an opportunity to listen to patients and fam-
ilies, to give information and to discuss advanced care
planning. An unhurried calm attitude was seen as
beneficial (table 4, Q10). Studies 3 and 9 identified
the importance of the team being available to visit at
the time of death (table 4, Q11–Q12).
Home visits were also seen as an opportunity to
have a break from caregiving, hence relieving the care-
giver by providing some form of respite. The need for
formal structured respite services was not congruent
among participants (table 4, Q15–Q16).
Competence
A team which was described by patients and caregivers
as competent was able to prevent, manage and relieve
suffering by providing effective physical and psycho-
logical symptom control and skilful communication.
When relieved from suffering, participants reported
enhanced feelings of security with opportunity to
pursue other goals, mainly living family life at home
with normality (ie, retaining family members’ roles
and usual family activities) and preparing for death.
Having access to knowledgeable professionals, who
were able to relieve patients’ physical and psycho-
logical symptoms, inspired trust in the team and hope
in future symptom control (Q17–Q18, table 4).
The two-way process of communication was an
essential component of home palliative care. Skilful
communication facilitated the provision of individua-
lised care adapted to family life, therefore enabling
patients and caregivers to retain some degree of nor-
mality at home. A team that was available to listen to
patients’ and caregivers’ life and disease history non-
judgmentally, and acknowledge their roles in the
disease process but also in the family, was seen as sup-
portive of patient and caregiver (table 4, Q19–Q21).
Informing
and
giving
anticipatory
guidance
was
another important aspect of this component, as it
allowed for patients and caregivers to participate in
decision-making, increasing the chances of receiving
care tailored to their specific needs and wishes, and
adapted to family life (table 4, Q22–Q24). When care-
givers were confident in their skills, care was better
adapted to family life, enhancing the sense of normal-
ity and management of uncertainty (table 4, Q25).

constructs
Second-order constructs
First-order constructs
Key components experiences
Illustrative quotes (Q)
Presence
Availability 24/7
Someone trustable always available, leading to
increase sense of security and less uncertainty
Q1. “When I just sat and said ‘I do not want to die, I do not want to die’, I got such intense death anxiety. Then it was so good to know that I could phone
the palliative home care team, they would come here… and my husband could rest a little. That is security, it is peace, inside me. That they are there, if
nothing else is to be found, they are there” (66-year-old woman with advanced cancer of unknown origin, study 13)
Q2. “I know that I can get help. When something happens, pain or something, it’s only a call and then they [palliative staff] come after fifteen or thirty
minutes at most. … It really gives you a feeling of security… I compare that to the year I had to go to the emergency department…This is heaven… It is
like being rich…” (35-year-old man with generalised malignancy, study 13)
Q3. “My husband could remain at home during the whole disease process, sleep in his own bed, spend time with the children, grandchildren, and friends (as
long as he still had the strength), knowing all the while that doctors and other staff members were accessible 24 hours a day. This gave us security, and it
was a privilege to have this arrangement during a difficult time” (caregiver, study 16)
Q4. “As soon as you call, you’ve got somebody. Within 20min we had an answer when I called about the pain med. I said that my aunt was having pain,
and the Percodan wasn’t getting it. The nurse said, “OK. That’s OK because we can do something about that.” I really think it’s a plus if there’s somebody
there all the time, because even if you don’t need something, I know that it’s there and that makes a big difference. If I hadn’t known there was somebody
there, I might have panicked. Just knowing that was a real big help. She called all the time asking if we needed this or needed that. I definitely needed that
kind of support.” (40-year-old niece, study 11)
Home visits
Security and relief through sharing responsibility
of caregiving with trustable staff
Q5. “The healthcare team supports, gives him intravenous drip and the nurses are there for us!; The nurse asked for a place in the bathroom to put the
equipment box, a big black carrier that was locked. It got its own place in the bathroom upstairs, beside my son’s bedroom […]” (caregiver of cancer
patient, study 9)
Q6. “When they (the team) are here it’s such a relief, I don’t feel like crying all the time, at least that’s how I feel” (caregiver, study 1)
Q7. “When [the doctor] came out to the house to see her, I really think that made her feel better, and I know it made me feel better.” (caregiver 5,
study 8)
Q8. “If there was a problem like pain, shortness of breath, or if some aid were needed to facilitate the care, the team arranged things: a morphine
pump, an oxygen tank, a commode, and so on.” (caregiver, study 16)
Q9. “You don’t know when it’s coming close [husband’s death]… And that gives you a feeling of insecurity. And you worry a bit… most unsure if you
can cope or not…if something happens…so you lose control of it all. But you know people [staff members] will come. Yes like this morning, when he
had such a bad turn [husband had epileptic fits]. It was really relaxed because they [staff members] were here” (65-year-old wife of patient with brain
tumour, study 13)
Q10. “No, you can talk with them. It is easier than if you have to call the doctor and talk, then you always have to hurry, it is not really the same// but
they are never in a hurry in that way, they know, they are never stressed really but they can sit there and have a minute of peace and quiet. Yes if there
is something else I want to ask about” (patient 5, study 19)
Q11. “…I think the worst thing was it took a while for the Red Cross to come and fetch everything back. That was the worst. I couldn’t come in here
until they’d been because I couldn’t stand looking at an empty bed. That was the worst I think” (caregiver 10, study 4)
Q12. “By then my son was still conscious but had difficulties speaking. One of the nurses stayed by my son […] The presence of the nurse was a relief
to me; The nurses made the examinations that are legally required to declare death. Then they and the family all gathered in the kitchen. There was time
to tell about the last hours, there were opportunities to weep, to share hugs. […] The nurses took charge of the practicalities. They arranged for the last
transportation. And they stayed as long as the family members wanted them to” (caregiver of 38-year-old patient with cancer, study 9)
Q13. “I call them “windows of time”. You’ve got an hour here or two hours there, so when one of my daughters is here, or somebody’s here. I’ll run
out and do some running around. I’ll grab that time to run. You have to be kind of flexible. You can’t be real strict [about your routine]. You have to
kind of flow with the punches and jump on the opportunity. Or sometimes he’ll sleep part of the time so you can break away without feeling like you’re
being neglectful.” (49-year-old wife, study 11)
Q14. “If someone came for some time to look after the patient and give the caregiver a rest, if they could stay there for a day and the caregiver can go
out, go shopping, just to get out then, that could give them a real break…”; “Is so different, I feel I am isolated, I feel I don’t have a life.” (caregiver,
study 7)

Competence
Effective symptom control (physical and
psychological)
Sense of security by relieving suffering and
trusting in team—opportunity to refocus on living
with normality and preparing death
Q17. “Six weeks ago, when I had difficulty breathing, I felt … the end is approaching… I just lay in bed and thought ‘I hope death will come soon’… I
had lots of thoughts like that over several days. … But then I got morphine [prescribed by the palliative home care doctor] …It has taken away these
thoughts … and now I feel calm again, in mind and body, and secure” (62-year-old woman with gynaecological cancer, study 13)
Q18. “Knowing that they know what they’re doing, I have confidence in the way they handle problems. I’m comfortable. You can trust them with having
the medical part of it competently too. I can tell from the way they express themselves, the kinds of things that they are saying. They tell you the point of
what they’re doing.” (40-year-old niece, study 11)
Effective communication skills (listen and
acknowledge roles, inform and teach, give
anticipatory guidance and share decision-making).
Care at home tailored to needs and adapted to
family life, facilitating normality at home and
giving a sense of control and mastery of the
situation. Increased security by managing
uncertainty through guidance
Q19. “I feel a bit insecure when it is not the same staff members coming… I have good contact with the two assigned nurses. It is not the same with
the others… The two assigned nurses sit down and talk to me…not only about me being sick … but about what I have done in my life, what I have
been able to do … it is more personal” (62-year-old man with prostate cancer, study 13)
Q20. “I’ve had three visits from the palliative care service and three different nurses have come, how can they know what I really need” (caregiver, study
10)
Q21. “I’d had total responsibility for my sick relative for four months, and for me, APHC was an enormous relief. For the first time in a very long time I
was incredibly relieved just to have someone that I could talk to sometimes.” (caregiver, study 16)
Q22. “Throughout the whole period of my husband’s illness, I tried to be with him as much as possible. I understood what was happening thanks to
APHC. Especially during the last days they were very skilled in preparing us what was going to happen, step by step. I really felt secure and felt their
deep human qualities!” (49-year-old woman, husband with lymphoma, study 14)
Q23. “It is very clear to me what is going on, the deterioration. I talk very openly with doctor X about that and mother takes part in these discussions
too. We discuss these issues very well, I think, so it is clear to me what is going on and that we are approaching the terminal stage, rather soon, I think.
Interviewer: Why do you think so at this point? Informant: I think so because of her blood tests, they have discovered new mets, she feels sick, has little
appetite and her condition is deteriorating.” (caregiver, study 15)
Q24. “[It was helpful for me with informative] Talks with doctors and nurses at APHC at my pace. The staff had a supportive attitude that gave me a
feeling of being one of the team, that was going to make life as comfortable as possible for my husband.” (70-year-old wife of patient with brain
tumour, study 14)
Q25. “I’ve got a little cooling bag that I have the injection in.…Those are the sort of things you have to remember to take with you; it’s easy now—
we’ve had it so long, so now you know what you need to take with you so that things will be okay.” (caregiver, study 2)

 obtained a different level of interpretation, given that
the four components contribute to some extent to the
feeling of security at home (Q1–Q4, Q9, Q17–Q19,
Q22),
as
shown
by
the
second-order
constructs
(table 4). Security was therefore identified as the
home palliative care core mechanism of action, enab-
ling patients to stay at home, as illustrated by the
following quote:
Now I feel safe if something happens. I know I can
turn to you. (patient with cancer, Study 5)
An appropriate level of security seemed to be
achieved when patients and/or caregivers were not
under unacceptable levels of suffering, that is, when
they felt relieved (from either burden or symptoms).
Hence, when being cared for by a present team, parti-
cipants felt that there was always someone available
for support and sharing of responsibility. When the
team was seen as providing competent care, it meant
that the support available was trustworthy and effect-
ive (third-order constructs in table 4).
In turn, feeling secure allowed patients and care-
givers to pursue two main valuable goals: (1) living
family life, which was fostered by being cared for at
home while preserving the most valuable experiences
(sometimes akin to ‘quality of life’ or ‘well-being’); (2)
preparing for death, that is, saying goodbyes, complet-
ing the narrative, finding meaning. The following four
quotes illustrate how home palliative care allowed for
participants to pursue these meaningful goals, by con-
tributing to their feeling of security at home.
He gets such good care and we are really happy. I also
think the feeling of security makes us feel more free so
we can go places we haven’t been able to visit for
years.
(current
caregiver of
chronic
heart
failure
patient, Study 1)
I perceived powerlessness when my husband, during
his illness, did not get enough attention and care from
healthcare. Since APHC came into our lives the
powerlessness has changed to confidence and calm.
There is time, both for my husband and me, to reflect
and to some extent accept the difficult situation we
are in. (63-year-old wife of patient with GI cancer,
Study 14)
My husband could remain at home during the whole
disease process, sleep in his own bed, spend time with
the children, grandchildren, and friends (as long as he
still had the strength), knowing all the while that
doctors and other staff members were accessible
24 hours a day. This gave us security, and it was a priv-
ilege to have this arrangement during a difficult time.
(caregiver, Study 17)
Interviewer: “Could you describe what it is like to feel
secure?” Patient: “Life with the disease does not take
over everything.… I know that if something is not
working, I only have to make a phone call [to the pal-
liative home care team] to get help. This makes you
focus on other things. When I come home I do not
think about it [the illness] at all … I do other things.
… and ie, the best praise I can give … that I do not
think about it.’” (35-year-old man with generalised
malignancy, Study 13)
These relationships between key components, secur-
ity, living life and preparing for death are depicted in
a simplified conceptual model of the experiences of
patients and caregivers with home palliative care
(figure 1). According to the interpretation obtained in
this review, we propose the following definition of
security in this context: security means to be able to
trust the home palliative care team to be there for
support, prevention and relief of avoidable suffering
at home, as the disease progresses.
DISCUSSION
By systematically reviewing the existing qualitative
research on the experiences of patients and family
caregivers with home palliative care services, this
meta-ethnography found evidence that these special-
ist/intermediate teams have a major role in providing
security at home. This was in turn achieved by the
teams when they were seen as: (1) being present, that
is, with availability to be contacted 24/7 and to visit
patients and caregivers at home, and (2) being compe-
tent, that is, providing effective symptom control and
communicating skilfully. This interpretation of the
patients and caregivers experiences implies that, by
contributing to their sense of security, the home pal-
liative care teams enabled patients and caregivers to
focus on the dual process of living family life and pre-
paring for death, while remaining at home.
Recent research suggests that caregivers’ sense of
security was higher when there was a trustful relation-
ship with the physician, and when patients were
relieved from physical distress.26 In a multivariable
analysis, Milberg et al27 found that a sense of mastery
over the situation was positively related to a higher
sense of security.
The finding that patients and caregivers’ sense of
security is a condition for them to remain at home,
creating the opportunity to pursue other goals, par-
tially fits with Zalenski’s model of Maslow’s Theory
of Needs (adapted to palliative care). In this model,
safety is physical and emotional and refers to being
free of fear.28 Also, these findings are aligned with the
attachment theory29 30 in the sense that feeling secure
enabled patients and caregivers to focus on goals with
an exploratory nature, that is, living life and preparing
for death. It is possible that these two processes con-
figure a dynamic model, with patients and caregivers
oscillating from one aspect to the other, as in the dual
model of confrontation and avoidance behaviours
when coping with bereavement.31 In fact, it is reason-
able to assume that patients and caregivers are going
through a process of anticipatory grief during the pal-
liative care phase.32

 Implications for policymakers, clinicians and future
research
Healthcare professionals taking care of these popula-
tions should be aware of their fundamental role in
influencing
the
experience
of
security
at
home.
Through competent skilful communication, teams
provide individualised care adapted to family life,
hence
enhancing
feelings
of
normality at home.
Skilful communication is a complex intervention in
itself, comprising: (1) listening to concerns with an
open attitude; (2) acknowledging patients and care-
givers as recipients and participants in care, and also
family
members;
(3)
informing,
teaching,
giving
anticipatory
guidance
and
facilitating
shared
decision-making.
This review also adds to the evidence that 24/7
availability is crucial for patients and caregivers to be
cared for at home in such difficult situations, support-
ing the recommendation of the European Association
of Palliative Care4 for teams to be available for
contact at any time.
As being relieved from symptom burden is such an
important
experience
in
enabling
security,
teams
should
be
able
to
screen
and
closely
monitor
symptom control, using for instance, patient-reported
outcome measures like the Palliative care Outcome
Scale (POS and POS-S).33 Finally, our review shows
that caregivers experience visits by home palliative
care teams to be a source of relief from caregiving
burden. Professionals should be aware of this poten-
tial when visiting at home.
Despite security being central to the experiences of
patients and caregivers, the more common measures
used in the home palliative care context do not
capture this concept. W
e therefore recommend that
the role of home palliative care teams in enabling the
experience of security should be better understood,
and security should be considered as a potential
outcome of these interventions. Also, integration of
our results with the quantitative findings from the
Cochrane review8 could further enlighten the hetero-
geneity found in the quantitative review, while con-
tributing to the identification of these components as
the active ingredients of home palliative care. Finally,
researchers should be aware of the need to adequately
report the home palliative care interventions received
by participants of qualitative and quantitative studies.
Strengths and limitations—review trustworthiness
W
e used a systematic methodology to screen the pub-
lished and unpublished literature according to the
recommendations of the PRISMA statement,16 enhan-
cing its dependability and credibility.34 35 The review
feasibility and usefulness was tested during the pilot,
and the limitations found were addressed at that stage.
The review also shows transferability and confirmabil-
ity, given that the 19 studies originated from 5 coun-
tries in 3 continents, and reported similar experiences
of patients and caregivers with home palliative care
services.
Being a structured interpretative methodology suc-
cessfully used before in healthcare research,20 the
meta-ethnographic method proved to be appropriate
to meet the aim, guiding and structuring the interpret-
ation of the findings, and allowing for interaction
between phases.
Nonetheless, a meta-ethnography is a challenging
methodology in all its stages.19 20
Despite the invaluable support from the library ser-
vices and attempts to contact the authors, we could
not retrieve seven references. Also, some decisions
regarding inclusion criteria were made later in the
review process and involved changes to the protocol
(these are presented in an online supplementary file).
Owing to the study interpretative nature, the find-
ings of this review are open to criticism. Other
researchers with different philosophical stances and
professional experiences could have obtained a differ-
ent synthesis. The major a priori assumption of the
review was that, by understanding the experiences of
patients and caregivers with home palliative care, we
would be able to identify which components of the
interventions had a major role in shaping these experi-
ences. To ensure that different perspectives were
accounted for, and that the interpretation obtained
reflected the results of the studies more than the
views of the reviewers, this study involved: (1)

CONCLUSION
This review showed that home palliative care increases
the sense of security of patients and caregivers facing
life-threatening diseases with palliative care needs at
home. Professionals taking care of these populations
should be aware of their security-enabling role, by
providing competent care and being present. Home
palliative care teams should be widely available and
empowered with the resources to be competent (ie,
providing effective symptom control and skilful com-
munication) and present (offering 24/7 availability
and home visits).
