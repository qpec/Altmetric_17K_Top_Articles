birth

Abstract
Background: In response to rising rates of medical intervention in birth, there has been increased international
interest in promoting normal birth (without induction of labour, epidural/spinal/general anaesthesia, episiotomy,
forceps/vacuum, or caesarean section). However, there is limited evidence for how best to achieve increased rates
of normal birth. In this study we examined the role of modifiable and non-modifiable factors in experiencing a
normal birth using retrospective, self-reported data.
Methods: Women who gave birth over a four-month period in Queensland, Australia, were invited to complete a
questionnaire about their preferences for and experiences of pregnancy, labour, birth, and postnatal care.
Responses (N = 5840) were analysed using multiple logistic regression models to identify associations with four
aspects of normal birth: onset of labour, use of anaesthesia, mode of birth, and use of episiotomy. The probability
of normal birth was then estimated by combining these models.
Results: Overall, 28.7% of women experienced a normal birth. Probability of a normal birth was reduced for
women who were primiparous, had a history of caesarean, had a multiple pregnancy, were older, had a more
advanced gestational age, experienced pregnancy-related health conditions (gestational diabetes, low-lying
placenta, high blood pressure), had continuous electronic fetal monitoring during labour, and knew only some of
their care providers for labour and birth. Women had a higher probability of normal birth if they lived outside major
metropolitan areas, did not receive private obstetric care, had freedom of movement throughout labour, received
continuity of care in labour and birth, did not have an augmented labour, or gave birth in a non-supine position.
Conclusions: Our findings highlight several relevant modifiable factors including mobility, monitoring, and care
provision during labour and birth, for increasing normal birth opportunity. An important step forward in promoting
normal birth is increasing awareness of such relationships through patient involvement in informed decision-making
and implementation of this evidence in care guidelines.

Background
The term ‘normal birth’ in academic literature and
health policy has more generally come to refer to a birth
without, or with limited, clinical intervention. A 2007
consensus statement by the Maternity Care Working
Party, Making Normal Birth a Reality, called for a stand-
ard definition of normal birth to increase confidence in
the auditing and monitoring of practice trends [1]. The
resulting definition described normal birth as an unassisted
vaginal birth without induction of labour; epidural, spinal
or general anaesthesia; or episiotomy [2]. Unlike some defi-
nitions, Werkmeister’s definition [2] is limited to the
process of birth and does not extend to outcomes of birth
such as vertex presentation and intact perineum.
The 1990s and 2000s saw a steady increase in rates of
medical intervention during labour and birth across a
number of developed countries [3]. While such proce-
dures can be life-saving, they also bear risk to women
[4–7] and their babies [8, 9] and thus should be limited
to instances of medical necessity. There has been in-
creasing international interest in promoting normal birth
and progression towards less medicalised models of

 birth in response to the rising rate of intervention. In
2005, The Royal College of Midwives launched the Cam-
paign for Normal Birth within the UK, now continued as
part of the Better Births Initiative [10]. Care providers in
Canada have published a Joint Policy Statement on Nor-
mal Birth to support, promote and protect normal birth
for women [11]. In Australia, current maternity care re-
form (National Maternity Services Plan: 2010) [12] is
based on an underlying philosophy of birth as a normal
physiological event. Normal birth guidelines were pub-
lished in the Australian state of Queensland in 2012 to
protect, promote and support normal birth [13]. Add-
itionally, the Towards Normal Birth in New South Wales
policy directive required all birthing facilities in that
Australian state to have a written policy for normal birth
by 2015 [14].
Despite increasing international interest there is rela-
tively limited evidence for how to best facilitate normal
birth as a multi-dimensional construct. To date, very few
studies have examined determinants of normal birth in
this way (i.e., based on Werkmeister’s definition) [2].
The Birthplace in England national prospective cohort
study [15] found that the rate of normal birth for low
risk women differed depending on the place in which
they were giving birth. Normal birth was more likely in
freestanding midwifery units or at home than within ob-
stetric units. More recently, Miller and colleagues [16]
examined a wider range of predictors and reported that
women were more likely to experience normal birth if
they were in a public rather than private facility, did not
have continuous fetal monitoring, were able to move
freely during their labour, gave birth in a non-supine
position, or delivered their baby outside standard busi-
ness hours. Primiparous women were less likely to ex-
perience normal birth [16]. These studies identify a
number of modifiable factors that can be used to inform
practice aimed at promoting normal birth. However, the
samples were limited to low risk women or women who
had a vaginal birth, respectively, and findings may not
generalise to all women (for example, as a means of pre-
venting intrapartum caesarean or for women with ob-
stetric risk factors).
Other research on factors that may reduce interven-
tion during birth has focused on individual procedures,
such as induction of labour or caesarean section. In
regards to modifiable factors, characteristics of care are
one source of variation. There is greater use of interven-
tion in private birthing facilities than in public facilities,
including induction of labour, epidural anaesthesia, episi-
otomy, instrumental vaginal birth, and caesarean section
[17–21]. These differences are not attributable to case
mix [22, 23]. Rates of intervention have also been shown
to increase for women outside midwifery-led continuity
models of care [24], who receive care from a larger
number of nurses in labour [25], give birth during busi-
ness hours [26, 27], or have continuous electronic fetal
monitoring during labour [28]. More specifically, some
practices have been associated with reduced need for re-
gional
anaesthesia
during
labour,
such
as
water
immersion during first stage labour [29], upright posi-
tioning and freedom of movement [30] and continuous
one-to-one support [31]. There is some consistency be-
tween these findings and those directly evaluating asso-
ciations with normal birth as an outcome.
Less modifiable characteristics have also been associ-
ated with increased intervention during birth. Rates of
intervention are typically increased for women with ob-
stetric
conditions
such
as
gestational
diabetes,
pre-eclampsia or placenta praevia [18, 32, 33]. While not
a risk factor in and of itself, primiparity is linked to
higher rates of induction [32, 34], epidural usage [35],
and caesarean section [36]. Furthermore, women with a
history of caesarean section are at a high likelihood of
having a repeat caesarean for this reason only [37].
Women with a body mass index (BMI) in the ‘obese’
range are at greater odds having an induced labour [32]
and a caesarean section [18, 38, 39] and older maternal
age is often associated greater use of intervention [40].
However, the relationship between age and intervention
is not always consistent, may be indirect, and may depend
on whether women have given birth previously [41].
The aim of this study was to expand current evidence
for factors which may promote or inhibit women achiev-
ing a normal birth. We examined a range of both modi-
fiable (e.g. continuity of care) and non-modifiable (e.g.
parity) factors, using secondary analysis of retrospective,
self-reported, population-level survey data of women’s
maternity care experience. Additionally, we aimed to
expand on the methods used in previous studies by pro-
viding the probabilities of achieving normal birth as a
singular construct among all women, irrespective of
their risk status.
Method
Background/sampling
All women who gave birth in Queensland, Australia,
across a 4-month period (October 2011 to January 2012,
inclusive) were invited by the Queensland Registry of
Births, Deaths and Marriages to complete the 2012 Hav-
ing a Baby in Queensland Survey; a cross-sectional
evaluation of women’s experiences of pregnancy, labour,
birth, and postnatal care [42]. Women who experienced
a stillbirth or neonatal death were sent a tailored survey
and not included in the current study. Women received
the survey 3 to 4 months after birth and could complete
it either online, on paper (returned using a provided
reply-paid envelope), or over the telephone with a
trained female interviewer and a translator if required. A

 reminder/thank you postcard was sent to all women ap-
proximately two weeks after the initial mail-out. This
survey and all subsequent analyses received clearance
from The University of Queensland’s Behavioural & So-
cial Sciences Ethical Review Committee. Completion of
the anonymous survey was taken as evidence of consent
to participate.
For women who had a live birth, the usable response
rate was 30.4% (5840 out of 19,194). The respondent
sample was approximately representative of the 2011
birthing population of Queensland for mode of birth,
previous caesarean section, plurality of pregnancy, area
of residence, infant birthweight and gestational age at
birth [43, 44]. The sample under-represented younger
women (aged less than 20 years), Aboriginal and/or
Torres Strait Islander women, and women birthing in
public facilities. Respondent characteristics are com-
pared with those of the 2011 Queensland birthing popu-
lation in Additional file 1.
Outcome variables
Normal birth was defined according to the Werkmeister
and colleagues definition [2]. Women were categorised
as having experienced a normal birth if they did not
have an induction of labour, epidural, spinal and/or gen-
eral anaesthesia, an assisted vaginal birth (with forceps
and/or ventouse) or caesarean section, or an episiotomy.
Normal
birth
was
broken
into
four
categorical
time-dependent outcomes: onset of labour, anaesthesia,
mode of birth, and episiotomy. This was to allow the in-
clusion of variables that may not have been relevant for
all women (e.g. water immersion in labour which was
only relevant for women who experienced labour). For
each subsequent outcome variable, only women who
were still eligible for meeting normal birth criteria were
included. For example, only those who had a spontan-
eous onset of labour were included in analyses examin-
ing use of anaesthesia during labour.
Onset of labour was assessed through a series of ques-
tions about whether women had experienced medical or
surgical procedures to induce labour, and whether
women had experienced any labour at all. Women were
coded as having a spontaneous labour if they did not
have prostaglandins, artificial rupture of membranes,
synthetic oxytocin, or a balloon catheter for the pur-
poses of inducing labour. Women who had a spontan-
eous labour were coded according to whether they used
anaesthesia during labour using the item ‘Did you have
an epidural or spinal (anaesthetic injection in your back)
for pain relief during labour?’. For women who did not
use anaesthesia during labour we assessed mode of birth
by asking ‘How was your baby born?’ with five response
options: an unassisted vaginal birth, a vaginal birth
assisted with a vacuum, a vaginal birth assisted with
forceps, a vaginal birth assisted by forceps and a vac-
uum, a caesarean birth. Women who had an unassisted
vaginal birth were then further categorised using the
item, ‘During your birth, did you have an episiotomy (cut
with scissors or a scalpel) to enlarge your vaginal open-
ing?’
, according to whether they had an episiotomy. The
remaining women who did not have an episiotomy were
those who had a normal birth.
Independent variables
Based on previous literature we selected a range of inde-
pendent variables, including demographic and obstetric
characteristics, antenatal and intrapartum care, experi-
ences during labour and birth, and organisational fac-
tors. These variables are detailed in Additional file 2.
Statistical models
Multiple logistic regression models were used to esti-
mate the associations between the independent variables
and the four binary outcomes: onset of labour, anaesthe-
sia, mode of birth, and episiotomy. Results are presented
as probability ratios. As a simple example, if the prob-
ability of a normal birth was 0.2 for women in the refer-
ence
group
and
0.1
in
another
group
then
the
probability ratio would be 0.5 (0.1 divided by 0.2), mean-
ing that the probability was halved compared with the
reference group. These probability ratios are used in-
stead of odds ratios (the ratios of odds) which are often
less intuitive and prone to misinterpretation – particu-
larly with highly prevalent outcomes.
To estimate the probability of a normal birth we
multiplied the estimated probabilities from the four lo-
gistic models (the probabilities of a spontaneous onset of
labour, no anaesthesia, an unassisted vaginal birth, and
no episiotomy). For example, if a woman had a 0.80
probability at each of the four stages than her probability
of a normal birth would be 0.804 = 0.41.
We used a Bayesian paradigm to fit the logistic models
so that we could multiply together the four probabilities
and create a mean and 95% credible interval for the
probability of normal birth. Ninety-five per cent credible
intervals are like 95% confidence intervals but have the
simpler interpretation of having a 95% probability of
containing the true value.
Relationships between the independent variables were
checked for co-linearity using variance inflation factors.
Type of facility (public or private) and place of birth
were found to have too much overlap with model of
care, and were excluded for this reason. For water
immersion during birth there was perfect prediction,
with all women birthing in water experiencing a normal
birth. This variable was excluded from the analysis as it
is likely a proxy for an intervention-free birth rather
than a predictor. Continuous variables were centred and

 scaled to help with the interpretation of the regression
models.
Analyses were conducted using R version 3.0.2 (2013–
09-25) software combined with JAGS to run the models
[45, 46]. We used a burn-in of 10,000 MCMC iterations
followed by 10,000 samples thinned by 3.
Results
Of the total sample, 53.1% had a spontaneous labour,
47.5% birthed without an epidural, spinal or general an-
aesthesia, 53.7% had an unassisted vaginal birth and
53.2% gave birth vaginally without an episiotomy. Com-
bining these four outcomes, the overall rate of normal
birth was 28.7% and was 44.3% among women who had
a vaginal birth. Descriptive information relative to the
independent variables is provided in Additional file 3.
Probability of having spontaneous labour
Women had higher probability of experiencing spontan-
eous labour if they had completed secondary education.
Relative to private obstetric care, women had a higher
probability of having a spontaneous labour if they were
receiving GP shared care, standard public care, public
midwifery continuity care, or private midwifery care.
The probability of experiencing spontaneous labour
was lower for women with gestational diabetes, high
blood pressure, other risk factors, or a multiple preg-
nancy. Women who were primiparous, multiparous with
a history of caesarean, older, of higher BMI, or of later
gestational age were also at a lower probability of having
a spontaneous labour. The mean probability ratios and
95% credible intervals are presented in Table 1.
Probability of not using Anaesthesia
The probability of not using anaesthesia during labour
was higher for women living in inner and outer regional
areas, receiving GP shared care, standard public care, or
public midwifery continuity care, not receiving augmen-
tation of labour, experiencing freedom of movement
throughout labour, or who had continuity of carer for
labour/birth (see Table 1).
Women had a lower probability of not using anaesthe-
sia if they were: primiparous, multiparous with a history
of caesarean, older, of a later gestational age at birth,
having a multiple birth, experiencing high blood pres-
sure, having continuous electronic fetal monitoring dur-
ing labour, or receiving care from only some known care
providers during labour and birth.
Probability of unassisted vaginal birth
The probability of having an unassisted vaginal birth was
reduced for women who were: primiparous, multiparous
with a history of caesarean, having a multiple birth, hav-
ing continuous electronic fetal monitoring, felt rushed
during their labour, or received their labour and birth
care from only some known care providers (see Table 1).
Probability of not having an episiotomy
Women had a higher probability of avoiding episiotomy
if they received standard public care or private midwifery
care, or if they gave birth in a non-supine position. The
probability of avoiding episiotomy was lower for prim-
iparous women and multiparous women with a previous
caesarean section. Mean probability ratios and 95% cred-
ible intervals are presented in Table 1.
Probability of normal birth
The probabilities of the four outcomes were multiplied
to give the overall probability of normal birth for each
independent variable (see Table 2). Overall, the probabil-
ity of having a normal birth was higher for women: liv-
ing in inner and outer regional areas; receiving GP
shared care, standard public care, public midwifery con-
tinuity care, or private midwifery care; who had freedom
of movement throughout labour; received continuity of
care in labour and birth; who had no augmentation of
labour; and who gave birth in a non-supine position.
The probability of having a normal birth was reduced
for women who were primiparous, multiparous with a
previous caesarean, older, had a multiple pregnancy, had
a later gestational age, had gestational diabetes, had a
low-lying placenta, had high blood pressure, experienced
other risk factors, had continuous electronic fetal moni-
toring in labour, and had only some known care pro-
viders for labour and birth.
Discussion
This study aimed to identify factors which may facilitate
or impede normal birth, using the definition of Werkme-
ister and colleagues [2] where normal birth is an un-
assisted
vaginal
birth
without
induction
of
labour,
epidural or general anaesthesia, or episiotomy. We cal-
culated the probability of normal birth based on a range
of modifiable and non-modifiable characteristics with
retrospective, self-reported data. We found that less than
half of women birthing vaginally (44.3%) and less than
one-third of all birthing women (28.7%) experienced a
normal birth. While consistent with previous Australian
research [16], this rate is lower than estimated rates of
normal birth (as defined by Werkmeister and colleagues)
in Scotland (35.5%) [47] and England (42%) [48].
We identified several modifiable and non-modifiable
factors that can inhibit or promote normal birth. In
regards to factors that were non-modifiable at the time
of pregnancy, women were less likely to experience nor-
mal birth if they were older, were primiparous, had pre-
viously given birth by caesarean, were having a multiple
birth, had obstetric health concerns (including high

 blood pressure, low-lying placenta, gestational diabetes,
or other risk factors), were at an earlier gestational age,
or lived in a major city relative to an inner or outer re-
gional area. These characteristics align with findings
from previous studies of normal birth [16] and the
broader literature around risk factors for medical inter-
vention in birth [18, 32, 41].
Perhaps of greater clinical utility in the promotion of
normal birth are the modifiable factors (after accounting
for clinical risk) we found to change women’s likelihood
of normal birth. The probability of normal birth was
higher for women who received care in a model other
than private obstetric care, had continuity of care during
labour and birth, knew none rather than some of their
care providers, had freedom of movement during labour,
did not have continuous fetal monitoring or augmenta-
tion, or birthed in a non-supine position. Despite the
sample and methodological differences in this study,
these findings are largely consistent with those of Miller
and colleagues [16].
The higher rate of obstetric intervention in private fa-
cilities is well-established [17–21]. By using model of
care rather than place of birth, we allowed exploration
of potential variation among different types of public
care models. Relative to private obstetric care, all other
models resulted in increased likelihood of normal birth
for women. Women receiving GP shared care or public
midwifery continuity care were at least twice as likely to
have a normal birth, while it was three times higher for
women in private midwifery care. Private obstetric care
is the primary model of care in private facilities and is
based around a medicalised view of birth. This contrasts
with a more naturalist philosophy typically adopted in
both public and private midwifery-led models [49].
These philosophical differences, along with the differing
clinical skills of lead care providers, are likely to contrib-
ute to the disparate probabilities of normal birth for
women receiving care in these models. Risk alone can-
not account for the higher rate of intervention in private
hospitals as discrepancies in outcomes remain after ac-
counting for obstetric and social risk factors [18]. The
relationship between model of care and normal birth is
relevant for women’s decision-making about their care,
however the associated risks and benefits of different
models are infrequently discussed at the time this choice
is made [50].
We also found that normal birth was less likely when
women knew some rather than none of their care pro-
viders. It is possible that this may relate to differences in
the organisation of labour and birth care between private
and public models of care (and thus, private and public
birth facilities). As we have demonstrated, models of
care provided in public facilities (GP shared care, public
midwifery continuity care and standard public care) in-
crease the probability of achieving a normal birth, and
may be less likely to provide a known care provider at
the time of labour and birth care. However, having previ-
ously known care providers for labour and birth may be
less relevant than having continuity of carer throughout
this time. We found that women with continuity of carer
for labour and birth (after accounting for known care
providers and model of care) were 24% more likely to
have a normal birth. Having continuous support during
labour is argued to provide emotional support and com-
fort, information and advocacy, enhancing women’s
sense of control and reducing the need for medical inter-
vention [31]. While continuity of care across pregnancy,
birth and beyond may be the ideal, having continuity of
carer for labour and birth may be a cost-effective solu-
tion to reducing intervention where resources are not
available for full continuity.
Our findings for a greater probability of normal birth
among women who didn’t have continuous electronic
fetal monitoring, had freedom of movement, or who
birthed in a non-supine position are consistent with pre-
vious studies about normal birth [16]. Other research
has identified that upright positioning during the first
stage of labour can reduce the use of epidural anaesthesia

 [30] and the incidence of instrumental delivery [51], both
factors that prevent a normal birth. Despite calls that the
risks and benefits of fetal monitoring during labour should
be discussed [52, 53], many women report that they are ei-
ther not informed or not involved in decisions about its
use [54]. The extent to which upright positioning and mo-
bility during labour and birth are encouraged by care pro-
viders remains unclear.
In contrast to a previous study of normal birth [16],
we did not identify timing of birth to be associated with
the probability of experiencing normal birth. Rates of
episiotomy [26] and instrumental vaginal birth [55] are
shown to be higher during regular working hours, while
the declining rate of weekend births appears to be re-
lated to the increasing rate of caesarean section [27].
Our lack of an association is potentially due to the stage
at which timing of birth was introduced in the analysis.
We did not examine timing of birth as a predictor
among women who had an induction of labour or a
planned caesarean – interventions where the effect of
staff availability and scheduling logistics are likely to play
a greater role in timing of birth. We also did not identify
a relationship between water immersion during labour
and normal birth. Aligned with our findings, a review of
water immersion during the first stage of labour also
found no effect on rates of assisted vaginal birth or cae-
sarean section [29]. However, we also did not replicate
the association between water immersion and the re-
duced need for epidural or spinal anaesthesia identified
in
this
review
[29].
Our
measurement
of
water
immersion during labour did not account for duration,
which may result in a less consistent relationship. There
is currently a lack of evidence and need for further re-
search
around
the
optimal
conditions
for
water
immersion during labour and how factors such as dur-
ation, depth of immersion, temperature and mobility
may affect this.
A strength of this study is that it appears to be the first
to have examined probabilities of normal birth as a
multi-dimensional construct for a wide range of predic-
tors and with a non-restricted sample of women. The
study also used population-level sampling to invite par-
ticipation and was uniquely able to use a combination of
clinical and experiential factors due to the self-reported
nature of the data, which has not been possible using
clinical reporting alone. A high level of concordance be-
tween maternal self-report and medical records has been
repeatedly demonstrated for clinical information pertain-
ing to birth [56–58].
While the respondent sample was representative of the
Queensland birthing population on many key clinical char-
acteristics, some characteristics were under-represented.
We could have used sampling weights to provide a closer
match to the Queensland birthing population; however
such weights are generally more important for estimating
prevalence, whereas our study was concerned with the as-
sociation between variables which we assumed were gener-
alisable from our sample to the wider population. We also
did not examine the inter-relationships between different
predictors of normal birth. While we identified certain
groups of women at a reduced likelihood of achieving a
normal birth, such as primiparous women or those with a
history of caesarean section, we did not examine how the
chances of normal birth may be increased for such groups.
Future research may wish to consider potential interactions
between modifiable and non-modifiable characteristics to
determine how intervention could be reduced among par-
ticular groups of women.
Conclusions
Despite increasing interest in normal birth, actual rates
remain low and research for how to facilitate this is min-
imal. Models of care with a more natural philosophy of
birth, not limiting women’s freedom of movement and
position during labour and birth, and continuity of care
provider throughout labour and birth are shown to in-
crease the likelihood of achieving a normal birth. To
support the desired promotion of normal birth, care pro-
viders and women must be made aware of existing evi-
dence for how care and treatment related factors
influence normal birth outcomes. Pragmatic evaluation
research is needed for how policies that relate to facili-
tating factors affect women’s experience of normal birth.
