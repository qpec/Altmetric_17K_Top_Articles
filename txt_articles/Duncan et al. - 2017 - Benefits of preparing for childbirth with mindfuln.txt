Abstract
Background: Childbirth fear is linked with lower labor pain tolerance and worse postpartum adjustment. Empirically
validated childbirth preparation options are lacking for pregnant women facing this problem. Mindfulness approaches,
now widely disseminated, can alleviate symptoms of both chronic and acute pain and improve psychological adjustment,
suggesting potential benefit when applied to childbirth education.
Methods: This study, the Prenatal Education About Reducing Labor Stress (PEARLS) study, is a randomized controlled trial
(RCT; n = 30) of a short, time-intensive, 2.5-day mindfulness-based childbirth preparation course offered as a weekend
workshop, the Mind in Labor (MIL): Working with Pain in Childbirth, based on Mindfulness-Based Childbirth and Parenting
(MBCP) education. First-time mothers in the late 3rd trimester of pregnancy were randomized to attend either the MIL
course or a standard childbirth preparation course with no mind-body focus. Participants completed self-report
assessments pre-intervention, post-intervention, and post-birth, and medical record data were collected.
Results: In a demographically diverse sample, this small RCT demonstrated mindfulness-based childbirth education
improved women’s childbirth-related appraisals and psychological functioning in comparison to standard childbirth
education. MIL program participants showed greater childbirth self-efficacy and mindful body awareness (but no
changes in dispositional mindfulness), lower post-course depression symptoms that were maintained through
postpartum follow-up, and a trend toward a lower rate of opioid analgesia use in labor. They did not, however,
retrospectively report lower perceived labor pain or use epidural less frequently than controls.
Conclusions: This study suggests mindfulness training carefully tailored to address fear and pain of childbirth may lead
to important maternal mental health benefits, including improvements in childbirth-related appraisals and the
prevention of postpartum depression symptoms. There is also some indication that MIL participants may use
mindfulness coping in lieu of systemic opioid pain medication. A large-scale RCT that captures real-time pain
perceptions during labor and length of labor is warranted to provide a more definitive test of these effects.
Trial registration: The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier for the PEARLS study is: NCT02327559. The study was retrospectively
registered on June 23, 2014.

 Background
Fear of childbirth poses substantial risks to healthy
adjustment from pregnancy through birth and into the
early postpartum period. It is related to low childbirth self-
efficacy, greater use of pain medication during labor, more
unwanted obstetric interventions in labor [1–3], as well as
increased risk of postpartum depression (PPD) [4]. Child-
birth education courses are the primary mechanism by
which pregnant women learn strategies for coping with
labor pain, yet childbirth education has limited efficacy for
reducing childbirth fear and in some cases may even cause
women to doubt their ability to cope with childbirth [5],
increasing fear. With over 3.9 million births in the United
States (U.S.) per year [6], innovative and accessible inter-
ventions for addressing childbirth fear and pain are critic-
ally needed. Mindfulness training – long used as a method
for promoting coping with chronic pain [7, 8] and shown
to be beneficial for acute pain [9, 10] – provides a novel
and promising strategy for preparing women for childbirth.
Childbirth fear, including its hallmark indicator of low
childbirth self-efficacy, predicts poorer labor and delivery
related outcomes. Alehagen and colleagues [1] compared
primiparous and multiparous women and found that
first time mothers had higher levels of fear of childbirth.
Fear of childbirth in early labor predicted the total
amount of pain medication used during the labor. Data
from the Danish National Birth Cohort of over 25,000
nulliparous women indicate that fear of childbirth during
pregnancy, particularly in late pregnancy (around 31 weeks),
was related to a higher risk of emergency Cesarean section,
controlling for other risk factors (i.e., weight gain, birth
weight, head circumference, and duration of pregnancy)
[2]. These findings suggest the potential utility of interven-
ing with first time mothers in the 3rd trimester to reduce
childbirth fear and pain and improve perinatal outcomes.
Fear of childbirth and negative birth experiences are
linked with depression, all of which can lead to poorer
mother-infant adjustment in the perinatal and postpartum
periods. In a sample of 89 women, pain catastrophizing
scores collected during active labor prior to the adminis-
tration of analgesia predicted both postpartum depression
and social functioning 6 weeks post-birth [11]. Antenatal
depression often goes undiagnosed and untreated; avail-
able treatments for PPD include psychotherapy and anti-
depressant medication, but barriers to therapy (e.g., stigma
concerns, time/expense involved) and risks of medication
to breastfeeding infants restrict access to those treatments
[12]. Data from trials of mindfulness interventions have
consistently shown a beneficial effect on depression symp-
toms and other mood disorders [13–15]. Incorporating
mindfulness into childbirth education available to the gen-
eral public offers pregnant women experiencing depres-
sion
symptoms,
or
otherwise
at-risk
for
PPD,
an
alternative, stigma-free
strategy
for
addressing
these
concerns while protecting their ability to engage in
medication-free breastfeeding and sensitive, responsive
mother-infant interactions.
The current study
We developed the Mind in Labor (MIL): Working with
Pain in Childbirth (author NB), a childbirth education
program that teaches mindfulness skills for coping with
childbirth pain and fear in a short, time-intensive 2.5-
day weekend workshop. We hypothesized that mindful-
ness training through MIL would: 1) produce an adap-
tive shift in fear and pain-related appraisals of childbirth,
thereby increasing childbirth self-efficacy and reducing
pain catastrophizing; 2) lead to lower labor pain ratings,
less use of pain medication in labor, and greater birth
satisfaction; and 3) lower perinatal depression symptoms
and protect against postpartum depression. This study,
the Prenatal Education About Reducing Labor Stress
(PEARLS) study, is a small, randomized controlled trial
(RCT) testing these hypotheses in a comparison of MIL
against a treatment-as-usual (TAU) active control condi-
tion of standard childbirth education with no mind-body
focus.
Methods
Participants
Inclusion criteria: participants were English-speaking
nulliparous women with low-risk, healthy, singleton preg-
nancies in their third trimester who were planning a
hospital birth and willing to be randomized. Exclusion
criteria included high-risk pregnancy, extensive prior
experience with meditation or yoga practice (brief prenatal
yoga did not lead to exclusion), participation in other mind/
body childbirth preparation courses (e.g., Hypnobirthing,
Bradley Method), or planned Cesarean birth. In terms
of race/ethnicity, the eligible, enrolled sample was 18%
Latina/Hispanic (n = 5, missing = 1); 59% White (n = 17);
17% Asian (n = 5); 14% Multiracial (n = 4); 7% Black/Afri-
can American (n = 2); 3% American Indian/Alaska Na-
tive (n = 1). More than half of the sample was below
area median household income (n = 16, 55%); 10% re-
ported household income < $10,000/year (n = 3). See Fig. 1
for the CONSORT flow chart of study participation.
Ethics approval and consent to participate
This study was approved by the University of California,
San Francisco (UCSF) Committee for Human Research
(Institutional Review Board). All participants gave signed
informed consent for participation in research and pro-
vided signed Health Insurance Portability and Account-
ability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) authorization for complete
medical record review.

 Procedures
First-time mothers in their third trimester of pregnancy
were recruited to the study through provider referrals,
as well as fliers and online parenting group recruitment
advertisements with language targeting women with typical
fears related to childbirth: e.g., “Are you worried about pain
during labor?”. Initial eligibility screening was conducted by
a brief online survey with follow-up by telephone to capture
information related to each of the inclusion/exclusion
criteria referenced above. We also collected information
regarding intention to use epidural.
To minimize the probability of baseline group differ-
ences, randomization was stratified by pre-course intention
to use epidural anesthesia and was performed with
randomly varying blocks of 2 and 5 using a pre-
programmed computer database. A UCSF senior biostatisti-
cian
not
affiliated
with
the
study
generated
the
randomization scheme. The study project manager (JGC)
enrolled and consented study participants; group assign-
ment and subsequent debriefing regarding intervention at-
tendance was conducted by him opening a sealed envelope
provided by the biostatistician. Data collection was com-
pleted online and through medical record review. The
remaining study authors (including data analysts) were
blinded to participant study condition.
As this was a small study with limited funding, we were
constrained to a sample size of N = 30 that was selected a
priori based on sample size recommendations for pilot

 trials (thus limiting our power to detect effects). Those
assigned to the MIL group (n = 15) were given a space in a
publicly available MIL workshop at UCSF during their
third trimester. Tuition for MIL was paid for by the study.
Participants assigned to the control condition (n = 15)
were offered up to $200 USD tuition reimbursement for
attending
a
study-approved,
standard
hospital-
or
community-based childbirth education course in the San
Francisco Bay Area.
Self-report assessments were conducted at three time
points: Time 1 (T1) = 3rd trimester baseline (immediately
pre-intervention and pre-randomization) at average gesta-
tional age 29.4 weeks (standard deviation; SD = 3.64 weeks);
Time 2 (T2) = in the week immediately following the inter-
vention (post-intervention but prior to birth); and Time 3
(T3) at post-birth (postpartum) follow-up (conducted, on
average, within six weeks after birth). In addition to provid-
ing childbirth education tuition, we offered incentive pay-
ments for each assessment (T1 = $40 USD; T2 = $50 USD;
T3 = $60 USD), gradually increasing the amount offered to
minimize study attrition. Data collection for this study was
completed in 2014.
The mind in labor (MIL): working with pain in childbirth
MIL is a brief intervention for pregnant women and their
partners specifically designed to target labor-related fear
and pain by teaching tailored mindfulness-based coping
strategies. It is a childbirth-specific, short form of the nine-
week Mindfulness-Based Childbirth and Parenting program
(MBCP) [16] adapted starting in 1998 from Mindfulness-
Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) [17]. The MIL course is
delivered by professionally certified MBCP instructors and
it is held over one weekend (Friday evening and all day
Saturday and Sunday) for a total of 18 h of mindfulness
training. Mindfulness strategies for coping with labor-
related pain and fear are taught through interactive, experi-
ential activities, with periods of didactic instruction.
In addition to standard childbirth preparation topics
(i.e. birth physiology), the MIL program includes the fol-
lowing aims and learning objectives: 1) participants are
guided to reframe childbirth pain as unpleasant physical
sensations that come and go, moment by moment; 2)
participants are taught how to uncouple the sensory
component of pain from its cognitive and affective
components, with the objective of decreasing fear and
suffering related to the physical pain of childbirth; 3)
participants learn how to be more aware of their own
body and fearful reactivity to pain by practicing mind-
ful coping with pain through a pain induction activity
with ice; 4) pregnant women and their birth partners
develop personalized strategies to best cope interper-
sonally and provide support to each other throughout
the birth process.
To meet these objectives, instruction in formal mind-
fulness meditation are given during the workshop, in-
cluding body scan, mindful movement/yoga, sitting and
walking meditation, and mindful eating, as well as ac-
tivities of daily living and pain coping strategies, such
as mindfulness of breath, partner touch, body move-
ment, and “sounding” (using low and/or loud vocal
tones during periods of intense physical sensation).
Additionally there is an inquiry practice between part-
ners exploring fear in general and fear of childbirth in
particular and specific mindfulness coping strategies for
being with pain with an attitude of acceptance. Partici-
pants are provided with handouts and guided audio
materials for optional practicing of mindfulness medita-
tion and pain coping strategies at home. In the current
study, the course developer (NB), a senior mindfulness
teacher and certified nurse midwife, provided facilita-
tion for all MIL intervention participants.
Active control condition: treatment as usual (TAU)
standard childbirth education
Participants assigned to the TAU control condition were
provided with a list of study-approved childbirth courses
of comparable length and quality to the MIL intervention,
but without any mindfulness meditation, mindful move-
ment/yoga, or other core mind/body component (e.g.,
hypnosis). To form the approved list, we conducted a web
search of available San Francisco Bay Area childbirth
preparation courses then followed up with direct contact
with providers to determine specific content regarding
any topics related to mind/body health or stress reduction.
If a control group participant could not find a pre-
approved course convenient to their location and sched-
ule, we offered to screen their preferred course. In this
way, our list of approved courses grew as participants in-
formed us of additional childbirth preparation programs.
TAU control participants were strongly encouraged to
participate in the control childbirth education with a part-
ner or support person, just as with MIL. In the current
study, n = 12 of the control participants reported that their
partner or spouse attended the course with them.
Measures
Eligibility screening and all assessments were administered
online via the Internet application, SurveyGizmo [18]. The
time points when they were administered to collect data
for the current study is noted in parentheses.
Childbirth self-efficacy (T1, T2)
Childbirth self-efficacy was assessed with the Childbirth
Self-Efficacy Inventory (CBSEI; α = .90) [19]. The self-
efficacy expectancy items rate how confident respondents
feel in their ability to use the behaviors during labor and
birth (1 = Not at all sure to 10 = Completely sure).
Duncan et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2017) 17:140 
Page 4 of 11
 Maladaptive pain appraisal (T1, T2)
Maladaptive pain appraisal was assessed with the Pain
Catastrophizing Scale (PCS; α = .92) [20]. Respondents
were asked to reflect on past experiences of physical
pain and to rate the degree to which they experience
particular thoughts and feelings (e.g., “It’s awful and I
feel that it overwhelms me” on a scale of 0 (Not at all)
to 4 (All the time).
Perceived pain in labor (T3)
The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) [21] was used to assess
perceived labor pain. Participants were asked to retro-
spectively mark the level of pain they felt for each stage
of labor on a 10 cm line representing a continuum of
“no pain” to “worst possible pain.” The VAS is one of the
most commonly used pain measures and it has been used
successfully to assess labor pain [22]. Participants rated
their experiences of pain on the VAS during early labor
(until 3–4 cm dilation), during active labor (from 4 cm to
pushing), during pushing until birth, and from birth of the
baby to delivery of the placenta.
Use of pain medication in labor
Use of pain medication in labor was ascertained from
medical record review. Epidural/spinal anesthesia and
opioid analgesia were coded as dichotomous variables.
Use of opioid analgesia was endorsed if any systemic
opioid narcotic (e.g., fentanyl, morphine) was adminis-
tered at any point during labor (before birth), independ-
ent of epidural/spinal anesthesia.
Birth satisfaction
A modified 24-item version of the Wijma Delivery
Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (W-DEQ; α = .94)
[23] was used (T1 - T3) to gauge satisfaction with the
birth experience (e.g., : “How happy were you in general
during the labor and delivery?”) controlling for W-DEQ
expectancies captured prior to labor and delivery. Items
were rated on an intensity scale from 1 = Extremely to 6 =
Not at all, and response options are customized for each
item (e.g., 1 = Extremely happy to 6 = Not at all happy).
Minor modifications to the scale were made in consult-
ation with obstetric experts on the study team to enhance
interpretability and cultural sensitivity of the terminology
(e.g., we removed the item asking whether participants
imagined they would feel “funny, natural, self-evident, or
dangerous” at the time of delivery).
Additionally, we asked respondents to rate their sat-
isfaction with their overall birth experience (T3), as
well as with the care they received from healthcare
providers during the labor and delivery (T3), on a
scale of 1 – 10, with 1 = Not at all satisfied and 10 =
Completely satisfied.
Depression
The 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
Scale (CES-D; Cronbach’s α ranging from .85 to .90) [24]
was used to measure depression symptoms (T1 - T3). The
CES-D is widely used and is recognized to be reliable and
valid. A score ≥ 16 is the clinical cutoff indicating risk of
clinical depression.
Mindfulness and mindful body awareness
The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) [25]
was used to assess levels of dispositional mindfulness (a
tendency to avoid mindlessness in everyday life) at each
time point (T1 - T3). The FFMQ consists of 39 items,
yielding subscale scores that measure five elements of
mindfulness (observing, describing, acting with awareness,
nonjudging of inner experience, and non-reactivity to
inner experience; Cronbach’s α ranging from .75 to .91).
The Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive
Awareness (MAIA) [26] was used (T1, T2) to assess
body awareness, which may be an important dimension of
mindfulness [27] and particularly relevant for women
preparing for childbirth. The MAIA consists of 32 items
and measures eight dimensions of interoceptive awareness
(noticing, distracting, worrying, attention regulation, emo-
tional awareness, self-regulation, body listening, and trust-
ing; Cronbach’s α ranging from .66 to .87).
Results
All analyses were conducted as intention to treat ana-
lyses with the sample of n = 29 (n = 14 control and n =
15 MIL). Results in Table 1 exclude n = 2 participants
who did not experience labor for whom the analysis
was therefore not valid.
Treatment group equivalence
See Table 2 for means and standard deviations for the
primary and secondary study outcomes. The two groups
(MIL and TAU) were compared at baseline using t-tests
and found to be equivalent (no statistically significant
group differences prior to intervention participation). Of
the n = 29 study participants, n = 4 experienced Cesarean
section (n = 2 per condition), and among those n = 2
experienced no labor (n = 1 per condition). Only n = 1

analgesia. The remainder of participants (n = 24) had
spontaneous vaginal births.
Childbirth appraisals
Childbirth self-efficacy
Childbirth self-efficacy (measured with the CBSEI,
efficacy subscale) increased by an average of 14.7
points in the TAU group and 78.2 points in the MIL
group (see Fig. 2). To assess differential treatment
effects, we constructed a linear mixed model with ran-
dom participant intercepts using R statistical software
with the Zelig library [28, 29]. Groups were dummy
coded as 0 = TAU and 1 = MIL. There was a significant
time*group interaction (t = 2.21, p = .04), indicating
that the MIL group improved significantly more (estimated
treatment effect = 64.4 points, 80% CI [26.1, 102.7]). In
addition, the effect for time was nonsignificant (t = .65,
p = .52), indicating that the increase in the TAU group

 was not by itself significantly different from zero. One
of the randomized participants was missing a CBSEI
score post-intervention. We re-ran these analyses with
multiple imputation using the Amelia II library [30]
(http://gking.harvard.edu/amelia) with the EM algorithm
for estimation. In the imputed dataset the estimated coef-
ficients did not change substantially and the critical time*-
group interaction remained significant (t = 2.18, p = .03).
Pain catastrophizing
Pain catastrophizing (measured with the PCS) dropped
by 3.6 points in the MIL group and was essentially un-
changed in the TAU group (see Fig. 3). The time*-
group interaction was not significant (t = -1.06, p = .30;
estimated treatment effect = -3.26 points, 80% CI [-7.3,
0.8]). When the missing data was imputed, the result
did not change (t = -.71, p = .48).
Pain medication use in labor
We tested for group differences in use of two types of pain
medication during labor. Two participants were excluded
from this analysis because they did not experience labor
due to scheduled Cesarean. The rate of narcotic use was
30.8% (n = 4) in the MIL group and 61.5% (n = 8) in the
control group. Despite this very large risk ratio (RR = .50),
the difference showed only a trend toward statistical
significance (Pearson χ2 (df = 1) = 2.48, p = .12) (See
Table 1). Epidural use was uniformly high and did not
differ between groups: 85.7% (n = 12) in the MIL group
and 84.6% (n = 11) in the control group (Pearson χ2 (df =
1) = .01, p = .94).
Restrospective perceived labor pain
For analysis of labor pain, we averaged each participant’s
four retrospective VAS scores (early stage, active, pushing,
and final). We identified narcotic use, epidural use, pitocin,
and birth weight as a priori covariates of interest. These co-
variates were not significantly associated with retrospective
perceived pain either singly (all p < .36) or in a simultaneous
model (multiple R2 = .19, p = .22). Condition was marginally
associated with pain, with higher scores for MIL partici-
pants (average score of 5.20 on the 1-10 VAS) than for con-
trol participants (average score of 3.88; b = 1.32, p = .07).
When condition was entered in a model with the four
covariates, its estimated effect dropped slightly (b =
1.08, p = .14) and the model overall was nonsignificant
(multiple R2 = .29, p = .15).
Body awareness and mindfulness
Body awareness measured by the MAIA scale increased
by an average of .10 points (per item) in the TAU group
and .56 points in the MIL group. The time*group inter-
action was significant (t = 2.25, p = .03; estimated treat-
ment effect = .46 points, 80% CI [.19, .72]). When the
missing data was imputed, the treatment effect remained
significant (t = 2.05, p = .04). Mindfulness as measured
by the FFMQ scale increased by an average of .09 points
(per item) in the TAU group and .08 points in the MIL
group. The time*group interaction was not significant
(t = -.12, p = .91; estimated treatment effect = -.01 points,
80% CI [.-16, .13]). When the missing data was imputed,
the result did not change (t = .01, p > .99).
Perinatal and postpartum depression symptoms
Depression symptoms (measured by the CES-D) were an-
alyzed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and follow-up.
Scores dropped by 3.3 points in the MIL condition from
pre- to post-treatment, and this improvement was largely
maintained at follow-up (see Fig. 4). We constructed a lin-
ear mixed model similar to that used for the other ques-
tionnaire measures; time was treated as a simple linear
factor (coded 0 at pre-treatment, 1 at post-treatment, and
2 at follow-up). The interaction between group and time
was significant: t = -2.13, p = .04. The estimated treat-
ment effect – reflecting the amount by which the two
groups diverged at each time point – was -3.34 (80% CI
[-5.22, -1.28]). A marginal main effect for time indi-
cated that the increase in depression for the TAU group
may have been statistically significant in itself (esti-
mated effect = 2.07 points per time point, t = 1.86, p
= .07). Two CES-D scores were missing; one at post-
treatment and one at follow-up. When missing data
were imputed, the interaction between group and time
remained significant (t = -2.12, p = .03). [Note. We re-

 ran these analyses with timepoint as a categorical vari-
able, reflecting the fact that change in depression might
not be linear. The results were very similar to those
presented here, with significant results for the critical
interaction at follow-up and marginally significant re-
sults at post-treatment.].
Birth satisfaction
Birth satisfaction was assessed postnatally using two
measures: the W-DEQ and the single-item satisfaction
rating. Average W-DEQ scores were 57.1 in the MIL
group and 61.6 in the control group, both near the mid-
dle of the possible range (0 – 144). The group difference
was not significant (t = .72, p = .48). Scores on the single-
item satisfaction rating were very high and likely showed
a ceiling effect: the overall mean response was 7.9 on a
1–10 scale, and a plurality of participants in both groups
responded with a 9 or 10 (57% of control and 47% of
MIL). To deal with the non-normality of the data, we di-
chotomized responses into <8 vs. ≥8. There was no differ-
ence between groups (Pearson χ2 (df = 1) = .51, p = .47).
Discussion
Previous interventions for childbirth pain and fear have
focused almost exclusively on: a) pharmacologic pain
management strategies that are important to provide as
available options under the standard of care but also
pose health risks for the mother and fetus [31], and b)
childbirth education that is geared toward increasing
factual knowledge about the stages and mechanics of
labor and birth, potential problems faced in labor and
delivery, and medical interventions that are available to
address those problems. Childbirth education is the
primary mechanism by which pregnant women learn
strategies for coping with pain in labor, yet in its
standard form it may fail to reduce fear of childbirth
[5]. We found that participation in the MIL, a short,
time-intensive weekend workshop form of childbirth
education that incorporates mindfulness can lead to
significant increases in childbirth self-efficacy not
found through participation in standard childbirth
education programs. These results are consistent with
a single-arm trial conducted of a Mindfulness-Based
Childbirth Education course in Australia [32] in which
participants experienced large improvements in child-
birth self-efficacy and fear of childbirth. Approaching
labor with a greater sense of self-efficacy may help
prevent an array of undesired outcomes in the intra-
partum period that were beyond the scope of this
small RCT, but that have been documented in prior
research (e.g., emergency Cesarean).
While recent advances in labor pain management
through medication have been necessary and appropri-
ate, mindfulness interventions offer a promising and
potentially appealing, evidence-based, complementary
approach that can equip the laboring woman to more
accurately appraise her ability to face labor pain, more
effectively cope with that pain, and make better reasoned
choices about the medical options available to her dur-
ing birth. We saw no reduction in epidural rate or retro-
spective reports of perceived pain during labor, but there
was a trend toward lower use of opioid analgesia during
labor. The systemic opioids commonly used for labor
analgesia have side effects that can negatively impact the
fetus [33], thus a lower rate of opioid analgesia is highly
desirable. The trend we found toward this outcome may
be a result of better labor pain coping among the MIL
participants, however we were unable to collect real-
time data from the labor experience to examine this po-
tential mechanism. In their meta-analysis of 48 pub-
lished RCTs, Bricker and Lavender [32] report that only
15% included data for opioid safety outcomes. Their re-
view of observational studies highlights the potential for
opioids to cause adverse effects in newborns and indi-
cates some data are available that link fetal exposure to
opioids during labor with risk of addictive and self-
destructive behaviors later in life. MIL offers a childbirth
preparation approach to complement pharmacologic
strategies for labor pain management that have variable
efficacy, can produce potentially harmful side effects,
and may be undesirable for some women.
Notably, we found a reduction in depression symptoms
that was maintained at postpartum follow-up in the MIL
condition whereas the TAU control group experienced a
rise in depression symptoms postpartum. Nationally in the
U.S., approximately 14% of women experience postpartum
depression (PPD) [34], a condition linked with enduring
risks to healthy child development extending into ado-
lescence. A robust literature documents the negative
impact of PPD on the quality of mother-infant interaction,
with studies showing less reciprocal [35] and more intru-
sive, hostile, disengaged, and withdrawn behavior among
mothers with PPD [36, 37]. Many women who experience
PPD have also been depressed during pregnancy [34],
indicating the benefit of antenatal intervention to prevent
PPD as we saw here. Others have developed indicated ap-
proaches to managing women’s depression in pregnancy,
e.g., with Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy-Perinatal
Depression [38, 39] which is promising; our universal pre-
vention approach in the form of childbirth education may
reach a broader audience among the general public, reach-
ing women at-risk for PPD who do not self-identify in that
way. MIL also includes fathers/partners, which may pro-
duce benefit for preventing fathers’ postpartum depression
(something not assessed in the current study) but a grow-
ing concern [40, 41].
In addition to showing beneficial improvements in
childbirth
self-efficacy
and
depression,
this
study

 demonstrated feasibility of online/telephone screen-
ing and retention of a diverse sample of pregnant women
in an RCT of MIL. There was considerable interest in trial
participation and even with rigorous RCT inclusion/exclu-
sion criteria that screened out numerous potential partici-
pants, we achieved our target sample in the desired time
frame. In terms of retention, only three participants left
the study before randomization and we had 100% reten-
tion from randomization to postpartum follow-up and
missing data on only two participants post-course. In in-
formal reports made to the MIL facilitator and the study
project manager, participants generally liked the format of
a weekend workshop that allowed them to complete their
childbirth education
all at once
versus needing to
complete a multi-week course while facing competing de-
mands due to weekday work schedules and other commit-
ments involved in preparing to become new parents.
Limitations
Our assessment of labor pain was substantially constrained
by the limitations of postpartum retrospective report, so it
is possible that an ecological momentary assessment proto-
col during labor may reveal benefits for pain tolerance or
sensitivity. The high rate of epidural use further limited the
utility of the pain ratings. Since poor data quality regarding
length of labor in the medical records prevented us from
examining that key potential covariate, we also cannot be
sure that the somewhat lower use of opioid analgesia was
due to the mindfulness training. However, the use of an
active comparison condition in an RCT design suggests the
encouraging results on this outcome should be further
tested. As with any small pilot study, we were underpow-
ered to detect some of our hypothesized effects and thus
we will aim to conduct a fully powered trial in the future.
In examining self-reports of general dispositional mind-
fulness and mindful body awareness, we saw significant
improvements in body awareness but not dispositional
mindfulness. The subfacets of mindful body awareness fit
much more closely with the logic model for the MIL
intervention involving developing mindfulness of bodily
sensations. In contrast, it was improbable that we would
see an improvement in self-report dispositional mindful-
ness in a program that did not emphasize development of
a formal daily meditation practice. We will aim to more
thoroughly
investigate
these
potential
mechanisms
and other hypothesized secondary outcomes of the
PEARLS study in future work.
In this rigorous pilot efficacy study, we employed the
intervention developer to deliver the MIL to all inter-
vention condition study participants. While ensuring the
high quality of the intervention delivery in the current
study, this strategy may pose concerns about future po-
tential for taking MIL to scale. Following expansion and
replication of the current findings, we strongly support
lines of inquiry that will tackle questions in mindfulness
research regarding the attributes, training, and skills
needed to effectively teach mindfulness-based programs
with potential for public health benefit.
Conclusions
We have developed a novel approach to fostering adap-
tive appraisals of childbirth and reducing perinatal de-
pression
symptoms
using
a
mindfulness
approach.
Although a more definitive trial is warranted, the results
of this small RCT suggest that by positively impacting
labor and birth processes, while also promoting healthy
psychological adjustment in the perinatal period, better
postpartum outcomes can be expected. We also success-
fully recruited and retained a more socieconomically and
ethnically diverse study sample than is often found in
mindfulness trials in the U.S., suggesting potential for
generalization of findings and receptivity to the interven-
tion approach as offered in MIL. If the efficacy of MIL is
further supported in a full-scale trial, we believe it can be
offered as a universal prevention program designed to re-
duce childbirth fear and improve adjustment across the
perinatal and postpartum periods, reduce pain medication
use in labor, and prevent postpartum depression. Inter-
vening in this sensitive period of developmental plasticity
may produce important long-term health benefits for
children and families.
