Abstract
Background: Pancreatic adenocarcinomas (PAs) have very poor prognoses even when surgery is possible.
Currently, there are no tissular biomarkers to predict long-term survival in patients with PA. The aims of this
study were to (1) describe the metabolome of pancreatic parenchyma (PP) and PA, (2) determine the impact of
neoadjuvant chemotherapy on PP and PA, and (3) find tissue metabolic biomarkers associated with long-term
survivors, using metabolomics analysis.
Methods: 1H high-resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
using intact tissues was applied to analyze metabolites in PP tissue samples (n = 17) and intact tumor samples (n =
106), obtained from 106 patients undergoing surgical resection for PA.
Results: An orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) showed a clear distinction between
PP and PA. Higher concentrations of myo-inositol and glycerol were shown in PP, whereas higher levels of glucose,
ascorbate, ethanolamine, lactate, and taurine were revealed in PA. Among those metabolites, one of them was
particularly obvious in the distinction between long-term and short-term survivors. A high ethanolamine level
was associated with worse survival. The impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was higher on PA than on PP.
Conclusions: This study shows that HRMAS NMR spectroscopy using intact tissue provides important and solid
information in the characterization of PA. Metabolomics profiling can also predict long-term survival: the
assessment of ethanolamine concentration can be clinically relevant as a single metabolic biomarker. This
information can be obtained in 20 min, during surgery, to distinguish long-term from short-term survival.

Background
Pancreatic adenocarcinomas (PAs) are extremely aggres-
sive cancers and have one of the poorest prognoses among
all cancers [1]. With an estimated 48,960 new cases in
2015 in the USA, pancreatic cancer is the twelfth most
common cancer, representing 3.0% of all the new cancers
diagnosed in the USA [2]. The majority of pancreatic
cancers are pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and are
localized in the head of the pancreas [3, 4].
Surgery is the only potentially curative treatment for
PA. Pancreatic surgery is associated with significant
morbidity and mortality. Indeed the mortality rate, even
in highly specialized centers, ranges from 2% to 5%, and
morbidity can be as high as 70%, especially in left
pancreatic resection [5, 6]. The extension of lymphade-
nectomy, with its high morbidity and low evidence-
based data, is actually a matter for debate [7, 8]. In
recent years, a significant shift towards targeted surgical
interventions has been proposed, relying on accurate

 characterization of PA, made possible by preoperative
imaging to help evaluate its resectability [9].
Even though computed tomography (CT) and mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI) studies now precisely
differentiate resectable or locally advanced versus unre-
sectable PA, there is currently a debate on whether sur-
vival can be predicted in resected patients on the basis
of imaging. Notably, the vascular contacts may be com-
plex to assess, especially after endoprosthesis or after
radio- and/or chemotherapy, where the prognostic value
of imaging is still debated [10]. The main prognostic fac-
tors for survival after cephalic duodeno-pancreatectomy
(CDP) are histological parameters, namely R0 margins,
nodal status, and differentiation [11, 12]. Although tech-
nical breakthroughs have been achieved in the field of
pancreatic surgery, it has nevertheless been shown that
the rate of R0 resection is rarely more than 20% and that
it consistently impacts survival [13, 14]. Nodal extension
depends on the extension of lymphadenectomy, as
shown by the impact of invaded node-to-total exam-
ined node ratio [15]. However, the benefit of extended
lymphadenectomy in PA has not been demonstrated.
Therefore, there is a lack of accurate prognostic fac-
tors, and currently no tissue biomarkers have been
identified to predict long-term survival in patients
with pancreatic cancer.
Gross examination and intraoperative extemporaneous
microscopic examination are reliable for diagnosis, but
cannot predict overall survival.
In recent years, metabolomics, or global metabolite
profiling, has been used to investigate the metabolite
changes associated with pancreatic cancers [16–21].
Metabolomics is the latest stage of the multi-omics
approaches. After genomics, transcriptomics, and proteo-
mics, metabolomics has been generating increasing inter-
est in scientific and medical communities in the past few
years, particularly in oncology [22] and more precisely in
pancreatic cancers. Currently, well-recognized tools for
metabolomics are nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy and gas (GC-MS) or liquid chromatography-
mass spectrometry (LC-MS). 1H high-resolution magic
angle spinning (HRMAS) NMR spectroscopy technology
is particularly suitable for the analysis of small samples of
intact tissue. This technique avoids the need for chemical
extraction procedures or for handling the samples, both of
which are required by MS and liquid-state NMR. HRMAS
NMR spectroscopy enables identification and quantifica-
tion of several metabolites from spectra with excellent
resolution and signal-to-noise ratio.
Beyond serum markers [16, 19], better characterization
of pancreatic tissue would be of particular interest in
PA. Consequently, there is a need for accurate tissue
biomarkers that could help surgeons distinguish between
long-term and short-term survivors. The aims of this
study were thus to (1) define the metabolome of pancre-
atic parenchyma (PP, healthy tissue) and PA, (2) deter-
mine the impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on
healthy tissue (PP) and PA, and (3) by using metabolo-
mics analysis, find metabolic biomarkers associated with
long-term survival in patients with PA.
Methods
Patient population
This study included 123 samples obtained from 106
patients retrospectively selected after they had under-
gone PA resection, from May 2000 to March 2011, in
the Department of Visceral Surgery and Transplantation
(University Hospitals of Strasbourg, Hautepierre Hos-
pital, Strasbourg, France). These patients fulfilled the fol-
lowing criteria: (1) histological diagnosis of PA, (2) all
follow-up patients, (3) only patients with tumor-related
deaths, (4) homogeneous adjuvant treatment using the
same chemotherapy (gemcitabine) for all patients (and
no radiotherapy), and (5) samples of pancreatic tissue
collected just after resection and then snap-frozen in
liquid nitrogen before storage.
Among the 106 samples obtained from patients with
PA, there were:
� 44 samples from patients who did not receive any
neoadjuvant chemotherapy
� 62 samples from patients who did
Among the 17 samples obtained from PP (healthy
tissue), there were:
� 9 samples from patients who did not receive any
neoadjuvant chemotherapy
� 8 samples from patients who did
Finally, two groups with extremely different prognoses
(PA samples) were compared:
� Long-term survivors (survival >3 years), 8 samples,
no neoadjuvant chemotherapy
� Short-term survivors (survival <1 year), 9 samples,
no neoadjuvant chemotherapy
For this investigation, the tissue samples were obtained
from the tumor bio-bank of Strasbourg University
Hospitals. A written informed consent was given by all
the included patients.
Tissue sample preparation for HRMAS NMR spectroscopy
All tissue specimens were collected during surgery just
after tumor removal and were snap-frozen in liquid ni-
trogen for –80 °C temperature storage. Then, the sample
preparation was performed at a temperature of –20 °C.

 The amount of tissue used for the HRMAS analysis
ranged from 15 mg to 20 mg. Each tissue sample was
placed in a 30-μL disposable insert. Next, 8 μL of
deuterium oxide with 0.75 weight percent 2,2,3,3-D4-3-
(trimethylsilyl)
propionic
acid
was
added
in
every
biopsy’s insert in order to get a chemical shift reference
for the NMR spectrometer. Finally, inserts were kept at
–80 °C until the HRMAS analysis was performed. The
insert was placed in a 4-mm ZrO2 rotor just before the
HRMAS analysis.
HRMAS NMR data acquisition
All HRMAS NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker
Avance III 500 spectrometer (installed at Hautepierre
Hospital, Strasbourg) operating at a proton frequency of
500.13 MHz and equipped with a 4 mm triple resonance
gradient HRMAS probe (1H, 13C, and 31P). The temperature
was maintained at 277.15 K throughout the acquisition time
in order to reduce the effects of tissue degradation during
the spectra acquisition. A one-dimensional (1D) proton
spectrum using a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse
sequence was acquired with an interpulse delay of 285 μs
and an acquisition time of 10 min for each tissue sample
(Bruker GmbH, Germany). The number of loops was set to
328, giving the CPMG pulse train a total length of 93 ms.
The chemical shift was calibrated to the peak of the methyl
proton of L-lactate at 1.33 ppm. In order to confirm reson-
ance assignments in a few representative samples, two-
dimensional (2D) heteronuclear experiments (1H – 13C)
were also recorded immediately after ending the 1D spectra
acquisition. Metabolites were assigned using standard me-
tabolite chemical shift tables available in the literature
(Table 1) [23].
HRMAS NMR data processing and statistical analyses
The HRMAS NMR data processing and the metabolites’
quantification have been previously detailed [24]. Briefly,
the region between 7.50 and 0.70 ppm of each 1D
HRMAS NMR spectrum was automatically bucketed
into integral regions of 0.01 ppm, using AMIX 3.9.14
software (Bruker GmbH, Germany). Once the data set
was obtained, it was then exported and analyzed into
SIMCA P (version 13.0.3, Umetrics AB, Umeå, Sweden).
An orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis
(OPLS-DA) was performed to analyze the data. The
following OPLS-DA model was considered: PP versus
PA (both without neoadjuvant chemotherapy). Two
measurements
of
model
quality
were
reported
for
OPLS-DA: R 2Y and Q2. R2Y > 0.7 and Q2 >0.5 can be
considered as a good predictor.
When the population is small, instead of applying
OPLS-DA analysis, network analyses using the “algo-
rithm to determine expected metabolite level alterations”
using mutual information (ADEMA) are justified [25].
This is why ADEMA has been applied to metabolite
quantification values. ADEMA evaluates the changes in
groups of metabolites between the case and the control
instead of analyzing metabolites one by one. ADEMA in-
cludes the metabolic network topology and uses mutual
information to find out if those metabolites are bio-
markers when considered together, and it can predict
the expected change in direction per metabolite when
the metabolic network topology is considered. The net-
work was constructed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes [26, 27] and Selway’s work [28].
The following groups of metabolites were compared
related to involved metabolic pathways:
� Choline, phosphorylcholine, glycerophosphocholine,
ethanolamine
� Glycerol, glucose
� Glucose, lactate
� Aspartate, threonine
� Glucose, glycine
� Aspartate, taurine
� Aspartate, succinate
� Glucose, ascorbate, glycine, glutamate
� Glutamate, glutamine
� Glutamate, glutamine, glycine
� Glutamate, glycine, creatine
� Tyrosine, phenylalanine
The metabolites were quantified using the PULCON
method, which is a very accurate quantification method
(with a very limited percentage of error [29]).
The repetition time used for this study (2 s) and the
total acquisition time (10 min) are hence a good com-
promise in order to quantify the metabolites by HRMAS
NMR spectroscopy of intact tissue. However, under
these conditions, we cannot see the whole of the metab-
olites, but only the freer parts of them. Furthermore, the
latter are underestimated about 20% in comparison with
studies performing tissue extractions (data not shown).
This method is widely used in the literature.
Metabolite quantification was performed using an
external
reference
standard
of
lactate
(3
μmol),
scanned under the same analytical conditions as the
tissue samples. Spectra were normalized according to
sample weight. Peaks of interest were automatically
defined by an in-house program using MATLAB 7.0
(MathWorks,
Natick,
MA,
USA).
Peak
integration
was then compared to the one obtained with the lac-
tate reference and was corrected according to the
number of protons. Only well-defined peaks with no
overlapping in the 1D CPMG spectra were selected
for quantification (Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5). Quantifica-
tion results were expressed as nanomoles per milli-
gram of tissue.

 Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± standard
deviation (SD). The Mann-Whitney U test was performed
to compare the metabolites’ concentrations of (1) PP and
PA (both without neoadjuvant chemotherapy), (2) PP
without and PP with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, (3) PA
without and PA with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and (4)
long-term and short-term survival in patients with PA
(Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5). The Mann-Whitney U tests were
performed using R software [30].
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and
Kaplan-Meier curves were used to perform a survival
analysis and therefore to evaluate the clinical utility of
metabolite
quantification
in
the
long-term
survival
characterization (R software [30]).
Results
All the spectra obtained from the 123 analyzed speci-
mens were of high quality without any obvious evi-
dence of tissue necrosis. A total of 31 metabolites
were identified within the range of 7.50–0.70 ppm
from the spectra obtained from all pancreatic tissue
samples (Table 1). Among the 31 identified metabo-
lites, only 18 metabolites were quantified: only well-
defined peaks with no overlapping in the 1D CPMG
spectra were selected for quantification.
The representative 1D HRMAS NMR CPMG spectra
of PP (healthy tissue) and PA samples (both without
neoadjuvant chemotherapy) are shown in Figs. 1a and
2a. Some discriminant metabolites were highlighted
using the Mann-Whitney U test. Choline (p = 0.0014),
ethanolamine (p = 0.0226), glycerol (p = 0.0037), glycine
(p = 0.0005), lactate (p = 0.0006), and taurine (p = 0.0021)
were statistically significant between PP and PA (both
without any neoadjuvant chemotherapy) (Table 2). Meta-
bolomic profiles of PP and PA were clearly separated by a
bi-component OPLS-DA (R2Y = 0.82; Q2 = 0.69) (Fig. 3).
A higher concentration of myo-inositol and glycerol was
shown in PP tissue samples. By contrast, a higher level of
glucose, ascorbate, ethanolamine, lactate, and taurine was
revealed in PA tissue samples.

 Impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on PP and PA
Seventeen samples from PP (healthy tissue) were in-
cluded in this model: 8 samples received a neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, while the 9 others did not (Fig. 1). No
discriminant metabolites were found using the Mann-
Whitney U test (Table 3). The network analysis showed
that a decreased level of succinate, aspartate, taurine,
phosphorylcholine, glucose, tyrosine, lactate, and glu-
tamine was predicted in PP samples from patients with
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Moreover, a higher level of

 did not (Table 4). As shown in Fig. 5, the network
analysis revealed a decreased level of lactate, which
was predicted in PA samples from patients with neo-
adjuvant chemotherapy. Moreover, higher levels of
ethanolamine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, aspartate, glu-
cose, glycerol, succinate, glycine, glutamate, glutamine,
and creatine were predicted in PA tissue samples
from patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The
other metabolites were predicted to be equivalent be-
tween the two groups.
For some of these analyses, the Mann-Whitney U test
did not yield any significant differences, whereas ADEMA
reports
some
changes
for
those
metabolites.
Thus,
ADEMA appears more effective, as it compares different
groups of metabolites, uses mutual information, and does
not require a large population of samples.
Long-term versus short-term survival in patients with PA
Patients’ characteristics are described in Table 6. The
representative 1D HRMAS NMR CPMG spectra of
long-term and short-term survivors are shown, respect-
ively, in Fig. 6a and b. Seventeen samples were studied: 8
long-term survivors and 9 short-term survivors (both with-
out any neoadjuvant chemotherapy). Some discriminant
metabolites were highlighted using the Mann-Whitney
U test. Choline (p = 0.0150), ethanolamine (p = 0.0078),
lactate (p = 0.0360), and phenylalanine (p = 0.0055) were
statistically significant between long-term and short-
term survival in patients with PA (Table 5).
The network analysis showed higher levels of glucose,
ascorbate, and taurine; this was predicted in long-term
survivors. Moreover, decreased levels of choline, etha-
nolamine, glycerophosphocholine, phenylalanine, tyro-
sine, aspartate, threonine, succinate, glycerol, lactate,
glycine, glutamate, glutamine, and creatine were pre-
dicted in long-term survivors. Phosphorylcholine was
predicted to be equivalent between the two groups
(Fig. 7).
Survival analysis
Statistical significant differences were highlighted when
we focused on the comparison between long-term and
short-term survival patients. Only the use of ethanolamine
as a single screening test showed a higher accuracy in dis-
tinguishing long-term from short-term survivors. As
shown in Fig. 8, samples with a decreased level of ethanol-
amine had a high probability of being assigned to long-
term survivors. All the patients showing a low level of
ethanolamine were long-term survival patients. The area
under the curve (AUC) was 0.861 ± 0.101. The optimal
ethanolamine threshold was 0.740 nmol/mg when distin-
guishing long-term from short-term survivors. With this
threshold point, sensitivity and specificity were, respect-
ively, 77.80% and 75.00% (Fig. 8a). The predictive positive

 value was 47.00% and the negative predictive value was
52.90%. A Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the overall
survival probabilities were significantly higher in patients
with low tumor ethanolamine concentrations compared
to those with high tumor ethanolamine concentrations
(Fig. 8b).
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that
has evaluated the metabolome of intact tissues for PP
and PA.
Preoperative assessment of resectability of PA is not yet
an adequate way of predicting survival. However, given the
morbidity and mortality of CDP, a better evaluation of the
balance between risks and benefits is a complex quest. In-
deed, serum markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen
(CEA) or carbohydrate antigen (CA 19-9) are poorly cor-
related to long-term results and should not be used for
contraindicating the only potentially curative treatment of
this often fatal disease. Up to now only histological param-
eters have enabled surgeons to retrospectively evaluate the
potential benefit of CDP, but these parameters are available
only after surgery. Moreover, none of these parameters is
really specific for predicting the necessity of pancreatic
resection. In order to evaluate the benefit of pancreatic
resection, long-surviving patients were compared to short-
term survivors. Of note, among the long-term survivors,
two of them showed an infra-millimetric margin, and three
had histological invasion of the portal vein (Table 6). Thus,
the use of currently described predictive factors should not
lead to contraindicating resection in patients who can
otherwise tolerate surgery [31]. The use of a more specific
marker tightly linked to the pathophysiology of pancreatic
cancer would be of particular interest.
HRMAS NMR provides new insights into the relation-
ships between metabolic pathways and pancreatic cancers.
This method allows for the identification of cell membranes
and phospholipid metabolism, cellular energy production
via neoglucogenesis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and
oxidative stress. The majority of PAs have KRAS mutation
(90% with activating mutations in this oncogene) [32–34].
Our results about PP’s metabolome show a higher
level of lactate, glucose, phosphorylcholine, taurine, as-
partate, lactate, glutamine, and succinate in patients who
received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (gemcitabine). Mu-
tations in TCA cycle enzymes are known to promote
cancer development and growth. For example, mutations
in succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), fumarate hydratase
(FH), and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1,
IDH2) can be cited [35, 36]. Moreover, these mutations

 have been associated with distinct cancer subsets and
different patient prognoses [37, 38]. Mutations in TCA
cycle enzymes have also been associated with measur-
able changes in the levels of metabolites. Nevertheless,
these mutations have not been a major feature of PA.
Reprogrammed cellular metabolism has increasingly be-
come an obvious field of research for PA. Research has
also focused on the alterations that involve the TCA
cycle and mutant KRAS-induced tumor cell dependen-
cies for glucose, glutamine, and extracellular protein.

 Our results about PA’s metabolome show a higher
level of lactate in patients who did not receive any neo-
adjuvant chemotherapy. Elevated expression of lactate
dehydrogenase A (LDHA) is highlighted in breast and
colorectal cancers [39, 40] and has been recently identi-
fied in pancreatic cancers [41]. Some studies have already
shown the different steps where LDHA is involved (tumor
initiation, maintenance, and progression) [42, 43]. Given
the elevated glycolysis in PA, leading to increased lactate
production, the ability to utilize lactate could provide an
additional advantage to PA cells [1]. Indeed, the inhibition
of glycolysis through suppressing LDHA expression by
RNA interference decreased the growth of PA cells [44].
Our study may provide new targets to treat PA. When pa-
tients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and pa-
tients
who
did
not
were
compared,
neoadjuvant
chemotherapy seemed to have an inhibiting effect on
LDHA expression. A higher level of lactate in patients who
did not receive any neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed
that survival of PA was highly dependent on LDHA activity
in a hypoxic environment. Then, this higher level of lactate
could be linked to improved responses to neoadjuvant
chemotherapy. Indeed, lactate might be a predictive
marker for assessing the response of tumor cells to neoad-
juvant chemotherapy. Finally, lactate could be correlated
with tumor neoadjuvant chemotherapy in predicting re-
sponses to this therapy. Elevated levels of lactate are prog-
nostic biomarkers for poor survival in several cancers. Our
findings suggest that lactate could be an important marker
for screening the efficiency of cancer treatments.
A decreased level of glucose has also been shown in PA
without neoadjuvant chemotherapy. As described in the
work of Koong et al. [45] and Guillaumont et al. [46],
areas within PA tumors are hypoxic, and this has
implications for the cellular metabolism. Hypoxia pro-
motes tumor growth by particularly stimulating glycolysis.
When PP and PA, both without chemotherapy, were
compared, some discriminant metabolites were highlighted,
particularly lactate and taurine. Our study shows a higher
level of lactate and taurine in patients with PA. These re-
sults are consistent with the work of Wang et al. [47]. The
work of Nishiumi et al. has also underlined elevated levels
of lactate in the patients’ serum [48]. As described in the
work of Wang et al., higher levels of taurine have also been
reported in the literature, for several types of cancer. As
previously explained, this increased lactate level in PA could
come from hypoxia. Our study is in accordance with other
studies that have found higher levels of taurine in different
types of cancer, probably due to apoptosis [49, 50]. Even so,
further studies will be needed to understand the complex
biology of that particular type of cancer. If confirmed by
other studies, this could deepen our knowledge of pancre-
atic cancer pathogenesis and might also lead to the identifi-
cation of new targets for diagnosis, early detection,
imaging, or even future therapeutic options.
Our results about PA’s metabolome in short-term sur-
vivors are in accordance with other studies that found a
higher level of choline in several cancers. The role of
choline kinase α (Chk-α) in malignant transformation
and progression in several cancers has been well de-
scribed in the literature. Increased levels and activity of
Chk-α have been observed in human breast [51], colo-
rectal [52], lung [52, 53], prostate [52], ovarian [54], and
more
recently
in
endometrial
[55]
and
pancreatic
cancers [56].
The
altered
choline
metabolism
we
observed
is
possibly due to an overexpression of Chk-α. Increased
levels of choline could be due to an increase in the

curve shows differences between long-term and short-term survival patients. The p value was 0.005 (for the log-rank test)

 membrane activity, particularly due to enhanced cellular
proliferation. This activity is increased in inflammatory
or tumoral conditions. In the most malignant cases, this
membrane activity is much higher still. Increased levels
of choline are also due to malignant transformation, and
particularly due to an overexpression of Chk-α. Hypoxia
may also affect choline phosphorylation through effects
on Chk-α and transporters [57]; in turn, choline phos-
phorylation may be affected by hypoxia through effects
on Chk-α and transporters. In some studies, particularly
in prostate cancer [58], increased levels in choline have
been described, leading to the development of 18F-fluor-
ocholine positron emission tomography (PET) imaging
in order to detect the increased uptake and the phos-
phorylation of the tracer. Consequently, our results are
in agreement with observations in the literature and
could represent the biological substrate and justification
to the use of 18F-fluorocholine PET imaging in pancreatic
cancers [59–61]. Metabolic targets in choline phospho-
lipid metabolism may provide new therapeutic options for
PAs that have severely limited options. Moreover, a de-
creased amount of succinate was shown by the network
analysis in long-term survivors compared to short-term
survivors, suggesting a decreased activity of the TCA
cycle. PAs from long-term survivors also show decreased
levels of threonine, aspartate, glycerol, glutamate, and glu-
tamine compared to those from short-term survivors.
Glutamine has been particularly studied for its role in can-
cer metabolism because it appears to be required for the
growth of many types of tumors [62]. Decreased levels of
creatine and lactate were shown in long-term survival pa-
tients too. Other studies showed the relationship between
lower levels of creatine, lactate, and choline and overall
survival [63]. Understanding the different metabolic links
within pancreatic cancer is a promising approach to iden-
tifying novel prognostic markers (long-term survival) and
therapeutic programs in patient care [1].
Short-term survivors showed higher levels of choline,
glycerophosphocholine, ethanolamine, and fatty acids, as
depicted in Fig. 6b (respectively, numbers 19, 25 and 21,
22). Fatty acids are a major factor in the growth of
tumor cells. Some explorations have begun in order to
study the PA metabolism and more precisely the role of
individual complex fatty acids. Indeed, as detailed in the
work of Guo et al. [64] and Zadra et al. [65], fatty acids
can be both pro-tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic, as
described for various cancers, making their biology diffi-
cult to explain. Reducing the levels of certain fatty acids
seems to be important for PA. But, we have to determine
first which fatty acids are cytotoxic for tumor cells and
which fatty acids provide the tumor with metabolic
substrates [1]. Focusing on ethanolamine, the survival
analysis showed that survival was longer for patients
with lower tumoral ethanolamine concentrations. The
assessment of ethanolamine concentration can be clinic-
ally relevant as a single metabolic biomarker for distin-
guishing long-term survivors from short-term survivors
in patients with PA.
The current study demonstrates that metabolomics
profiling may provide prognostic information in patients
with pancreatic cancer. Research has usually focused on
enzymatic steps within the TCA cycle, as it potentially
influences the progression of disease, as well as on alter-
ations of the phospholipid metabolism within the cho-
line/ethanolamine membrane.
Only very few patients are needed to build a model
that can predict oncological outcome in pancreatic
cancer very accurately; this fact alone should help in
promoting our technique.
We acknowledge some limitations to the present
study. First, the number of patients is limited, particu-
larly regarding the long-term survivors included into our
study. Pancreatic cancers are extremely aggressive and
have one of the poorest prognoses among all cancers.
Thus, very few patients get a chance of long-term
survival, and even less so without any neoadjuvant
chemotherapy. Second, further studies should take into
account other elements that affect the survival of pa-
tients. We believe these data are preliminary and should
be validated in further series. We encourage others to
validate the findings and to carry out multicenter stud-
ies. Indeed, in order to include co-factors, the patient
population needs to be significantly enhanced (because
PAs have one of the poorest prognoses among all
cancers). Third, we acknowledge that a comparative ef-
fectiveness study should be performed in real time in
order to evaluate usual serum markers versus HRMAS
NMR spectroscopy before making any definitive conclu-
sions. Fourth, due to the limited number of patients and
the preliminary character of our results, it is difficult to
draw a conclusion about the level of ethanolamine. For
the moment, there is no specific concept. Fifth, although
we acknowledge that the assessment of ethanolamine
concentration can be clinically relevant as a single meta-
bolic biomarker for distinguishing long-term survivors
from short-term survivors in patients with PA, this re-
sult should be put into perspective. Indeed, sensitivity
and specificity are respectively 77.80% and 75%. Lastly,
this study was retrospective and may involve some bias
that could have been unaccounted for.
Metabolomics analysis could be validated as an intraop-
erative discriminant method for distinguishing healthy
tissues from PA tissues. This could deepen our knowledge
of PA metabolism and may also lead to the identification
of new targets for diagnosis, imaging, or future therapeutic
options. If these results are confirmed in further studies, it
is expected that the role of intraoperative HRMAS NMR
spectroscopy could then be evaluated in the setting of PA.

 This approach, which we call “metabolomics-guided sur-
gery,” could help surgeons to extend the excision if neces-
sary. Since HRMAS NMR spectroscopy enables rapid
characterization of intact tissue, it could also be used as
an intraoperative method. HRMAS analysis only takes
20 min. Data analysis is also very quick (<10 min).
Furthermore, the cost is < $50 per sample.
Conclusions
In conclusion, as we are able to distinguish PP from PA,
we could imagine using this technique to analyze several
samples collected from the excision cavity in addition to
tissue tumor samples. This last step could help surgeons
in the detection of residual tumor cells in the excision
cavity and the control of margins. This approach could
be used in clinical routine for prediction of long-term
survival in patients with PA; indeed, this information
can be obtained in 20 min during surgery. Finally, due to
the high morbidity and mortality during surgery, we
could also imagine using this technique before surgery,
with the use of endoscopic or percutaneous biopsy,
although these remain invasive techniques. On the
whole, our own technique could prove useful and have a
positive impact on patient care.
