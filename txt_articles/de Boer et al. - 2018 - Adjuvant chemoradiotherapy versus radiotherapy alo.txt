Summary
Background Although women with endometrial cancer generally have a favourable prognosis, those with high-risk 
disease features are at increased risk of recurrence. The PORTEC-3 trial was initiated to investigate the benefit of 
adjuvant chemotherapy during and after radiotherapy (chemoradiotherapy) versus pelvic radiotherapy alone for 
women with high-risk endometrial cancer.
Methods PORTEC-3 was an open-label, international, randomised, phase 3 trial involving 103 centres in six clinical 
trials collaborating in the Gynaecological Cancer Intergroup. Eligible women had high-risk endometrial cancer with 
FIGO 2009 stage I, endometrioid-type grade 3 with deep myometrial invasion or lymph-vascular space invasion (or 
both), endometrioid-type stage II or III, or stage I to III with serous or clear cell histology. Women were randomly 
assigned (1:1) to receive radiotherapy alone (48·6 Gy in 1·8 Gy fractions given on 5 days per week) or radiotherapy 
and chemotherapy (consisting of two cycles of cisplatin 50 mg/m² given during radiotherapy, followed by four cycles 
of carboplatin AUC5 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m²) using a biased-coin minimisation procedure with stratification for 
participating centre, lymphadenectomy, stage of cancer, and histological type. The co-primary endpoints were overall 
survival and failure-free survival. We used the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis for 
final analysis by intention to treat and adjusted for stratification factors. The study was closed on Dec 20, 2013, after 
achieving complete accrual; follow-up is ongoing. PORTEC-3 is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN14387080, 
and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00411138.
Findings 686 women were enrolled between Nov 23, 2006, and Dec 20, 2013.  660 eligible patients were included 
in the final analysis, of whom 330 were assigned to chemoradiotherapy and 330 were assigned to radiotherapy. 
Median follow-up was 60·2 months (IQR 48·1–73·1). 5-year overall survival was 81·8% (95% CI 77·5–86·2) with 
chemoradiotherapy versus 76·7% (72·1–81·6) with radiotherapy (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0·76, 95% CI 
0·54–1·06; p=0·11); 5-year failure-free survival was 75·5% (95% CI 70·3–79·9) versus 68·6% (63·1–73·4; 
HR 0·71, 95% CI 0·53–0·95; p=0·022). Grade 3 or worse adverse events during treatment occurred in 198 (60%) of 
330 who received chemoradiotherapy versus 41 (12%) of 330 patients who received radiotherapy (p<0·0001). 
Neuropathy (grade 2 or worse) persisted significantly more often after chemoradiotherapy than after radiotherapy 
(20 [8%] women vs one [1%] at 3 years; p<0·0001). Most deaths were due to endometrial cancer; in four patients 
(two in each group), the cause of death was uncertain. One death in the radiotherapy group was due to either 
disease progression or late treatment complications; three deaths (two in the chemoradiotherapy group and one in 
the radiotherapy group) were due to either intercurrent disease or late treatment-related toxicity.
Interpretation Adjuvant chemotherapy given during and after radiotherapy for high-risk endometrial cancer did not 
improve 5-year overall survival, although it did increase failure-free survival. Women with high-risk endometrial 
cancer should be individually counselled about this combined treatment. Continued follow-up is needed to evaluate 
long-term survival.

Introduction
The majority of women with endometrial cancer present 
with early-stage disease and have a favourable prognosis. 
About 15% of women with endometrial cancer are 
diagnosed with high-risk disease, which comprises 
endometrioid endometrial cancer stage I, grade 3 with deep 
invasion or with lymph-vascular space invasion (LVSI), 
stage II or III endometrioid endometrial cancer, or 
non-endometrioid (serous or clear cell) histology. Women 
with high-risk endometrial cancer are at increased risk of 
distant metastases and cancer-related death.1–4 Serous and 
clear cell cancers have a higher risk of aggressive spread 
and a worse prognosis; however, in the early stages they 
have similar outcomes to grade 3 endometrioid endometrial 
cancer.5
Pelvic external beam radiotherapy has been the 
standard adjuvant treatment for women with high-risk 
endometrial cancer for many decades, although there is a 
paucity of evidence on improvement of survival. 
Randomised 
trials6,7 
have 
compared 
adjuvant 
chemotherapy 
with 
external 
beam 
radiotherapy. 
Radiotherapy was shown to delay pelvic recurrence and 
chemotherapy was shown to delay distant metastases, 
but no differences in survival were found.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for clinical studies published in English 
between Jan 1, 1980, and Dec 31, 2006, with the terms 
“endometrial cancer” AND “radiation therapy” AND 
“chemotherapy” AND “survival” OR “failure free survival”. 
We identified six relevant publications. Three randomised 
controlled trials compared chemotherapy with radiotherapy. 
The GOG-122 trial compared whole abdominal radiotherapy 
with doxorubicin–cisplatin chemotherapy in patients with 
stage III or IV endometrial cancer. In adjusted analysis, 
improved progression-free survival and overall survival were 
reported for patients treated with chemotherapy, but with 
high proportions of patients with toxicity and similar event 
rates in both groups. Two trials (one in Italy and one in Japan) 
compared pelvic radiotherapy with three cycles or five cycles of 
cyclophosphamide–doxorubicin–cisplatin chemotherapy in 
stage I–III disease and neither showed any difference in overall 
survival or relapse-free survival. In the Italian trial, most 
patients had stage III disease, and chemotherapy delayed 
distant metastases and radiotherapy delayed pelvic recurrence, 
but without differences in overall survival or progression-free 
survival. Because of increased pelvic relapse with the use of 
adjuvant chemotherapy alone, the combination of 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy merited exploration. The 
phase 2 RTOG-9708 trial, which assessed toxicity on the 
chemoradiotherapy schedule on which PORTEC-3 is based, 
reported 4-year overall survival of 85% and disease-free 
survival of 81%. Since the start of recruitment to the 
PORTEC-3 trial, the results of three randomised trials 
comparing chemoradiotherapy with radiotherapy alone have 
been published. A small Finnish trial compared radiotherapy 
alone with chemotherapy plus radiotherapy given in two 
courses of 28 Gy each; no difference in overall survival or 
recurrence was reported. The NSGO-EC-9501/EORTC-55991 
trial was published in a pooled analysis with the unfinished 
ManGO Iliade phase 3 trial, and showed significantly improved 
progression-free survival and a trend for improved overall 
survival with the addition of four cycles of platinum-based 
chemotherapy given sequentially before or after pelvic 
radiotherapy. Two more trials (GOG-249 and GOG-258) have 
not yet been fully published, but have been presented as 
abstracts at conferences. The results of the GOG-249 trial, 
which compared pelvic radiotherapy with a combination of 
three cycles of carboplatin-paclitaxel chemotherapy and 
vaginal brachytherapy in stage I–II patients with high 
(intermediate) risk factors reported overlapping progression-
free survival and overall survival curves, and significantly more 
pelvic and para-aortic recurrences in the chemotherapy group. 
The GOG-258 trial compared chemoradiotherapy (the same 
schedule as used in the PORTEC-3 trial) with six cycles of 
carboplatin–paclitaxel chemotherapy alone. No differences in 
overall or recurrence-free survival were reported, but 
significantly more vaginal and pelvic or para-aortic recurrences 
were reported in the chemotherapy group.
Added value of this study
We report the overall survival and failure-free survival of 
patients with high-risk endometrial cancer treated in the 
international PORTEC-3 trial. Patients were randomly 
assigned to receive pelvic radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy 
combined with concurrent (two cycles of cisplatin) and 
adjuvant (four cycles of carboplatin–paclitaxel) 
chemotherapy. The addition of chemotherapy to adjuvant 
radiotherapy significantly improved failure-free survival 
compared with radiotherapy alone, but not overall survival. 
Vaginal and pelvic control was high with radiotherapy in both 
groups. The treatment duration was longer in the 
chemoradiotherapy group than in the radiotherapy group, 
and significantly higher rates of adverse events were reported 
in the chemoradiotherapy group during, and in the first year 
after, treatment.
Implications of all the available evidence
Combined adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy cannot 
be recommended as a new standard of care for patients with 
stage I–II endometrial cancer because no survival differences 
were found and pelvic control was high with radiotherapy 
alone. Patients with stage III cancer had the greatest benefit 
with chemoradiotherapy because of their higher risk of 
disease recurrence; for these patients, combined treatment 
should be considered to maximise failure-free survival. 
Nevertheless, the benefits and risks should be discussed for 
each individual patient.

Because increased incidence of pelvic relapse has been 
reported with chemotherapy alone, the combination of 
external beam radiotherapy with chemotherapy has been 
explored. In a phase 2 trial (RTOG 9708)8 among women 
with high-risk endometrial cancer, the combination of 
external beam radiotherapy with two concurrent cycles of 
cisplatin, followed by four adjuvant cycles of cisplatin 
and paclitaxel, was tested, resulting in 4-year overall 
survival of 85% and disease-free survival of 81%.
Because the combination of radiotherapy and 
chemotherapy 
(chemoradiotherapy) 
seemed 
more 
effective than either treatment alone, and because data 
for toxicity and quality of life were lacking, the 
randomised PORTEC-3 trial was initiated to evaluate the 
benefit of chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone 
for women with high-risk endometrial cancer in terms of 
overall survival and failure-free survival improvement, as 
well as toxicity and effects on health-related quality of 
life. Analysis of 2-year toxicity and health-related quality 
of life in the PORTEC-3 trial showed significantly higher 
rates of adverse events and reduced health-related quality 
of life during and after chemoradiotherapy treatment, 
with rapid recovery thereafter.9
Here, we present the final analysis of the primary 
survival endpoints of the PORTEC-3 trial.
Methods 
Study design and participants
PORTEC-3 was an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial 
at 103 centres (oncology centres, university hospitals, 
regional hospitals, or radiation oncology centres with 
referrals from regional hospitals) in six clinical trial 
groups collaborating in the Gynaecological Cancer 
Intergroup. Participating groups were the National 
Cancer Research Institute (NCRI; UK), Australia and 
New Zealand Gynaecologic Oncology Group (ANZGOG; 
Australia and New Zealand), Mario Negri Gynaecologic 
Oncology Group (MaNGO; Italy), Canadian Cancer Trials 
Group (CCTG; Canada), and Fedegyn (France).
Patients were eligible if they had endometrial cancer

Obstetrics 
(FIGO)

stage 
1A 
endometrioid 
endometrial cancer grade 3 with documented LVSI; 
stage IB endometrioid endometrial cancer grade 3; 
stage II endometrioid endometrial cancer; stage IIIA, 
IIIB (parametrial invasion), or IIIC endometrioid 
endometrial cancer; or serous or clear-cell histology 
endometrial cancer with stages IA (with invasion), IB, II, 
or III. Eligibility also included WHO performance score 
0–2; adequate bone marrow function (white blood cells 
≥3·0 × 10⁹/L, platelets ≥100 × 10⁹/L), liver function 
(bilirubin ≤1·5 × upper normal limit [UNL], aspartate 
amino 
transferase 
and 
alanine 
aminotransferase 
≤2·5 × UNL), 
kidney 
function 
(creatinine 
clearance 
>60 
mL 
per min calculated according to Cockroft and Gault10 or 
>50 mL per min EDTA clearance), and aged 18 years or 
older (without an upper age limit, because elderly women 
might benefit from the study treatment if deemed fit 
enough to undergo chemotherapy). Exclusion criteria 
were uterine (carcino)sarcoma; malignancy in the 
10 years before diagnosis of endometrial cancer; previous 
pelvic radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, or chemotherapy; 
bulky cervical involvement with radical hysterectomy; 
inflammatory bowel disease; residual macroscopic 
tumour; impaired renal or cardiac function; grade 2 or 
worse neuropathy; grade 3 or worse hearing impairment; 
or congenital hearing disorder.
Surgery comprised total abdominal or laparoscopic 
hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. 
Lymphadenectomy, whether systemic or sampling, was 
left to the discretion of participating centres, while lymph 
node debulking and para-aortic lymph-node sampling 
were recommended in cases of macroscopic positive 
pelvic nodes or para-aortic nodes (or both). Lympha-
denectomy was not mandated in view of the lack of 
improvement in overall or progression-free survival in 
early-stage disease and its associated toxicity, mainly 
lymph oedema.11,12 For high-risk disease, the value of 
lymphadenectomy to direct adjuvant treatment is 
debated,13 and the international STATEC trial14 has been 
initiated to address this issue. For serous or clear-cell 
carcinoma, full surgical staging (with omentectomy, 
peritoneal biopsies, and lymph node sampling) was 
strongly recommended. Central pathology review by the 
groups’ reference gynaecopathologists was required 
before randomisation to confirm patients' final suitability 
for study entry.
Written informed consent was obtained from all 
patients. The protocol was approved by the Dutch Cancer 
Society and by the Ethics Committees of all participating 
groups. The study protocol is available online.
Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to chemoradiotherapy 
or radiotherapy alone. Treatment was allocated with a 
biased-coin minimisation procedure, ensuring balance 
overall and within each stratum of the stratification factors 
(participating centre, lymphadenectomy, stage of cancer, 
and histological type). Patients were registered and 
randomised by the participating group’s data centres and 
treatment was assigned via a web-based application. The 
assigned treatment was generated immediately by the 
randomisation programme and confirmed by email. 
Participants and investigators were not masked to 
treatment allocation.
Procedures
Central pathology review was done by reference 
gynaecopathologists (as appointed by each participating 
group before the start of the trial) to determine final 
eligibility. The slides and blocks were sent to each 
participating group’s central review pathologists at one 
gynaecological pathology review site (in France and Italy), 
two sites (in the UK and the Netherlands), or

five to six sites (in Australia and New Zealand, and 
Canada), with the result of the review confirming the 
patient’s eligibility for the trial being sent to the local 
investigators within 1 week. Details of pathology review 
and inter-observer variation compared with local 
pathology assessment are reported separately.15 In this 
analysis, review pathology assessment was used. If any 
particular details were missing, the original pathology 
was used for these specific items. LVSI was recorded as 
present or absent. Extensive LVSI in the parametrial 
tissues was considered stage IIIB. In case of serosal 
breach, metastases in the stroma of the fallopian tubes, 
in the ovaries, or on the peritoneal surface of the tubes or 
ovaries (or both), the stage was defined as IIIA. After 
determination of eligibility and patient consent, a tumour 
sample was centrally stored for future translational 
research.
External beam pelvic radiotherapy was given in both 
treatment groups to a total dose of 48·6 Gy in 1·8 Gy 
fractions, 5 days a week. For 11 of the 32 UK sites, a 
dose of 45 Gy (1·8 Gy fractions) was allowed if specified 
before initiation of the trial. The clinical target volume 
included the proximal vagina, parametrial tissues, 
and internal, external, and common iliac lymph node 
regions up to the L5–S1 level. The clinical target volume 
was extended to include the aortic bifurcation in case 
of iliac lymph node involvement; to include the lower 
peri-aortic region for common iliac node involvement; 
and to include the higher para-aortic region in case of 
para-aortic involvement (with a margin of ≥2 cm above 
the highest involved lymph node). If complete bilateral 
lymphadenectomy had been done with at least 12 lymph 
nodes, it was recommended to have the upper clinical 
target volume border at the iliac bifurcation. In case 
of cervical involvement (glandular, stromal, or both), 
a brachytherapy boost was given to the vaginal vault. 
Brachytherapy dose was equivalent to 14 Gy in 2 Gy 
fractions (with recommended scheme of 10 Gy high-dose 
rate [HDR] in fractions of 5 Gy), specified at 5 mm from 
the vaginal vault surface. Most patients were treated 
with a four-field technique; use of intensity-modulated 
radiotherapy was allowed for centres per approval by 
their group’s principal investigator.
Treatment was recommended to start within 4–6 weeks 
of surgery, but no later than 8 weeks. Overall radiotherapy 
treatment time was not to exceed 50 days. Radiotherapy 
quality assurance was not initially part of the trial, because 
pelvic radiotherapy was standard practice and used in 
both groups. However, the Trans-Tasman Radiation 
Oncology Group (TROG) initiated a bench-marking and 
quality assurance programme for the ANZGOG group,16 
and in 2012, a protocol amendment allowed a short 
quality-assurance programme to be activated for all other 
participating sites, with independent review of a single 
radiotherapy plan for each site.
Patients in the chemoradiotherapy group received 
two cycles of intravenous cisplatin 50 mg/m² in the first 
and fourth week of external beam pelvic radiotherapy, 
followed by four cycles of intravenous carboplatin AUC5 
and paclitaxel 175 mg/m² at 21-day intervals. This schedule 
was based on the RTOG-9708 trial,8 with substitution of 
cisplatin by carboplatin in the adjuvant phase to reduce 
toxicity and in view of the use of carboplatin–paclitaxel 
chemotherapy in metastatic disease.17
Adjuvant chemotherapy was to be started within 
3 weeks after completion of external beam pelvic 
radiotherapy, and with a 28-day interval from the second 
concurrent cycle. Toxicity, however, had to be resolved to 
better than grade 2 before start of chemotherapy.
In the event of toxicities, cisplatin was postponed for 
1 week. If recovery required more than 1 week, or in the 
case of neuropathy of grade 2 or worse, cisplatin was 
discontinued. Carboplatin was postponed or stopped in 
case of severe haematological toxicity. Paclitaxel was 
postponed for grade 2 neuropathy and stopped if recovery 
exceeded 1 week or grade 3 neuropathy developed. 
Carboplatin and paclitaxel were delayed for other 
grade 3–4 toxicities, and discontinued if no recovery or 
reduction to grade 1 occurred. Details on chemotherapy 
stopping rules have been described previously.9
At each follow-up, patient history was taken with 
emphasis on toxicities and symptoms of recurrent 
disease, and physical and pelvic examination were done. 
Chest radiography, blood count, and chemistry tests 
(including Ca-125) were to be obtained annually, up to 
5 years. Long-term follow-up (by hospital visit or 
information from the general practitioner) was required 
at 7 years and 10 years.
Outcomes
The coprimary endpoints were overall survival and 
failure-free survival. Overall survival was defined as 
time from date of randomisation to date of death from 
any cause. Failure-free survival (defined as any relapse 
or death related to endometrial cancer or treatment) 
was defined as time from randomisation to date of first 
failure-free survival event. Failure-free survival events 
were evaluated by the central data manager, the chief 
investigator, and the associated investigator, who were 
unaware of treatment allocation. Women who were 
alive at the time of analysis were censored at the date of 
their last follow-up. Secondary endpoints were vaginal, 
pelvic, or distant recurrence; treatment-related toxicity; 
and health-related quality of life (published elsewhere9). 
Recurrences were analysed according to first site of 
recurrence. Abdominal recurrences outside the pelvic 
area (peritoneal carcinomatosis, liver, and para-aortic 
lymph nodal metastases) were considered distant 
metastases, with specification of site.
Toxicity was assessed and graded with Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 3.018 at baseline (after surgery), at completion of 
radiotherapy, after each chemotherapy cycle, at 6-month 
intervals from randomisation until 5 years, and at 7 years

and 10 years. Grade 2 or worse adverse events were to be 
reported, regardless of the association with study 
treatment. For evaluation of mild (grade 1) toxicities, 
patient-reported health-related quality-of-life symptoms 
were used because patient reporting of grade 1 toxicities 
was considered most reliable.19 Serious adverse events 
had to be reported within 24 h, specifying adverse event 
grade and whether or not they were associated with study 
treatment.
Statistical analysis
The PORTEC-3 trial was powered (80%) to detect a 
10% difference in 5-year overall survival (increase from 
65% to 75%; hazard ratio [HR] 0·67), with a two-sided 
α value of 0·05. 198 events were required, with a 
minimum number of 655 patients. The number of 
required patients was increased to 670 to ensure 
655 eligible and evaluable patients. Power calculation of 
the coprimary endpoint failure-free survival was based 
on the same principles as overall survival.
The first prespecified interim analysis was done after 
48 overall survival events (a third of the required events) 
had occurred in September, 2013, only 3 months before 
reaching complete accrual. In October, 2016, we decided, 
with permission from the Data Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB), not to do the prespecified second interim 
analysis at two-thirds of overall survival events, because 
this would have no consequences for the trial and would 
reduce α-spending. To maintain an overall α of 
0·05, with a nominal α level for the first interim analysis 
of 0·0002, the final analysis was done with a nominal 
α of 0·0498. For analysis of the coprimary endpoints, 
overall survival and failure-free survival with a 
correlation between the test-statistics of the coprimary 
endpoints of 0·7859 (based on 136 overall survival 
events and 186 failure-free survival events), a nominal 
α of 0·0309 was used for each of the analyses, resulting 
in an overall α level of 0·0498.20
Because deaths in the PORTEC-3 trial were lower than 
expected at the time of trial design, the required number 
of overall survival events was not expected to be reached 
before late 2018. Recurrence was highest in the first 
3 years after treatment, with a sharp decline thereafter, 
and relapse was rare after 5 years. For these reasons, the 
DSMB approved the final analysis becoming time-based 
rather than event-based, with final analysis at a median 
follow-up of 5 years and 42 months additional follow-up 
after inclusion of the last patient. 
We did statistical analyses using SPSS version 23.0 and 
R version 3.2.1. All analyses were done by intention to 
treat, excluding patients who immediately withdrew 
informed consent and ineligible patients. Differences in 
relapse and survival rates between the groups were tested 
with log-rank test and Cox-regression analysis. The 
analysis of the primary endpoints was adjusted for 
the 
stratification 
factors 
(participating 
group, 
lymphadenectomy, stage of cancer, and histological type), 
as the appropriate method when using a stratified 
minimisation procedure at randomisation.21,22 For 
adjusted analysis, stratification factors were included as 
covariates in the Cox model. For analysis of failure-free 
survival and recurrence, competing-risk methods were 
used.23 For failure-free survival, intercurrent death was 
used as a competing risk. For the first failure analysis of 
recurrences, all other recurrences and death were used 
as competing risks. Predictive factors were assessed

Results
Between Nov 23, 2006, and Dec 20, 2013, 686 women 
were enrolled and randomly assigned to chemo-
radiotherapy (n=343) or radiotherapy (n=343). 26 patients 
were excluded: 13 because of immediate informed 
consent withdrawal and 13 because they did not fulfil the 
eligibility criteria (figure 1). 660 patients were included

in the primary analysis (chemoradiotherapy, n=330; 
radiotherapy, n=330). Median follow-up was 60·2 months 
(IQR 48·1–73·1) overall and was 60·0 months 
(47·8–73·1) in the chemoradiotherapy group and 
60·7 months (48·7–72·9) in the radiotherapy group. 
There were seven major protocol violations: in the 
chemoradiotherapy 
group, 
five 
patients 
refused 
chemotherapy and received radiotherapy only; in the 
radiotherapy group, two patients asked to switch to 
chemoradiotherapy (figure 1).
Patient characteristics were well balanced between the 
treatment groups (table 1). The median age was 62 years 
(IQR 
56·2–68·0). 
Lymphadenectomy, 
lymph 
node 
sampling, or full surgical staging were done in 190 patients 
(58%) 
in 
the 
chemoradiotherapy 
group 
and 
in 
192 patients (58%) in the radiotherapy group.
Radiotherapy was discontinued in one patient ( <1%) in 
the chemoradiotherapy group because of disease 
progression and five patients (1·5%) in the radiotherapy 
group because of toxicity (table 1). 329 (100%) of 
330 patients in the chemoradiotherapy group and 322 
(98%) of 330 patients in the radiotherapy group received 
an external beam pelvic radiotherapy dose between 
45·0 and 50·4 Gy. Vaginal brachytherapy was given in

309 (47%) patients (151 [46%] chemoradiotherapy patients 
vs 158 [48%] radiotherapy patients). Apart from the 
protocol indication for brachytherapy boost (cervical 
invasion), 28 (4%) patients received a brachytherapy 
boost for locally perceived reasons such as LVSI, 
grade 3, or stage III.
Both cycles of concurrent cisplatin were completed by 
304 (92%) of 330 patients in the chemoradiotherapy 
group. 
Adjuvant 
chemotherapy 
was 
started 
by 
304 (92%) patients, while 262 (79%) patients completed 
all four cycles of carboplatin and 233 (71%) patients 
completed all four cycles of paclitaxel (table 1). At least 
one dose reduction of cisplatin (to 40 mg/m²) was 
recorded for five (2%) patients, of carboplatin (from 
AUC5 to AUC4) for 36 (11%) patients, and of paclitaxel 
(from 175 mg/m² to 135 mg/m²) for 50 (15%) patients. 
Chemotherapy was discontinued in 61 (18%) patients; in 
31 (9%) because of toxicity, patient decision in 20 (6%), 
disease progression in seven (2%), and for other reasons 
in three (1%).
Evaluation of the TROG quality assurance programme 
for the ANZGOG group showed that a radiotherapy 
benchmarking exercise before participation in the trial 
ensured high conformity and low rates of both minor 
and major contouring deviations.16 Evaluation of 
radiotherapy plans from centres in other countries is 
ongoing and will be reported separately.
At final database lock on May 1, 2017, 136 patients had 
died (61 in the chemoradiotherapy group and 75 in the 
radiotherapy group) and 186 patients had a failure-free 
survival event (83 in the chemoradiotherapy group and 
103 in the radiotherapy group). Among the patients 
assigned to chemoradiotherapy, 50 (82%) had died from 
endometrial cancer, four (7%) from a second cancer, 
three (5%) from other intercurrent disease, and two (3%) 
from treatment for metastatic disease. Among the 
patients assigned to radiotherapy, 68 (91%) had died 
from endometrial cancer and five (7%) from a second 
cancer. For the remaining four patients (two patients 
treated with chemoradiotherapy and two patients with 
radiotherapy), the cause of death was uncertain. In one 
patient in the radiotherapy group, death was due to either 
disease progression or late treatment complications; in 
two patients in the chemoradiotherapy group and one in 
the radiotherapy group, death was due to either 
intercurrent disease or late treatment-related toxicity. 
These four deaths were counted as failure-free survival 
events after discussion with the DSMB.
Estimated overall survival adjusted for stratification 
factors at 5 years was 81·8% (95% CI 77·5–86·2) for 
patients in the chemoradiotherapy group versus 
76·7% (72·1–81·6) for patients in the radiotherapy group 
(HR 0·76, 95% CI 0·54–1·06; p=0·109; table 2, figure 2). 
5-year failure-free survival was 75·5% (70·3–79·9) in the 
chemoradiotherapy group versus 68·6% (63·1–73·4) in 
the radiotherapy group (HR 0·71, 0·53–0·95; p=0·022). 
Without adjusting for the stratification factors, the HR 
for overall survival was 0·81 (95% CI 0·58–1·13; p=0·213) 
and for failure-free survival was 0·76 (0·57–1·02; 
p=0·067; table 2, figure 2).
In subgroup analysis, women with stage III 
endometrial cancer had significantly lower overall 
survival and failure-free survival than those with 
stage I–II disease (tables 3, 4). 5-year overall survival for 
stage III cancer was 78·7% (95% CI 72·2–85·7) in the 
chemoradiotherapy group versus 69·8% (62·4–78·1) in 
the radiotherapy group (HR 0·71, 95% CI 0·45–1·11; 
p=0·13; adjusted p=0·074). 5-year failure-free survival for 
stage III cancer was 69·3% (95% CI 61·1–76·2) in the 
chemoradiotherapy group versus 58·0% (49·3–65·7) in 
the radiotherapy group (HR 0·66, 95% CI 0·45–0·97; 
p=0·031; adjusted p=0·014; figure 2). 5-year failure-free 
survival for stage I–II patients was 80·8% (74·1–86·0) in 
the chemoradiotherapy group versus 76·6% (69·5–82·2) 
in the radiotherapy group (0·85, 0·54–1·33; p=0·47).

survival than the other histological subtypes; failure-free 
was 58% (95% CI 42–70) with chemoradiotherapy versus 
48% (34–61) with radiotherapy (HR 0·63, 95% CI 
0·36–1·12; p=0·11). The number of patients and events 
are, however, small in these subgroups (appendix p 3).
Isolated vaginal and pelvic recurrences were rare, with 
isolated vaginal recurrence diagnosed in one (<1%) patient 
in the chemoradiotherapy group and in one (<1%) patient 
in the radiotherapy group (p=0·995), and isolated pelvic 
recurrence in three (1%) patients in the chemo-
radiotherapy group versus five (2%) patients in the 
radiotherapy group (p=0·473). Most recurrences were 
distant metastases: 76 (22%) patients in the chemo-
radiotherapy group versus 93 (28%) patients in the 
radiotherapy group were diagnosed with distant 
metastases (p=0·108). The 5-year estimate of pelvic 
recurrence (both isolated and combined pelvic and 
distant recurrences) was 4·9% (95% CI 3·0–7·9) for the 
chemoradiotherapy group versus 9·2% (6·5–12·9) for 
the radiotherapy group (p=0·026; table 2).
In the multivariable analysis, the following covariates 
were included together with treatment: stage, histological 
type and grade, type of surgery, participating groups, 
LVSI, and age. In the presence of these factors, combined 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy significantly improved 
failure-free survival. Most factors, except lympha-
denectomy, were significantly correlated with failure-free 
survival (table 4).
In multivariable analysis for failure-free survival, only 
age group was found to be predictive of treatment effect, 
with a strong treatment-by-age effect (pinteraction=0·012, 
figure 3). Women aged 70 years or older had the greatest 
benefit from chemoradiotherapy.
Grade 2 or worse adverse events were reported during 
treatment in 308 (93%) women in the chemoradiotherapy 
group versus 144 (43%) in the radiotherapy group, and 
grade 3 or worse in 198 (60%) versus 41 (12%; p<0·0001; 
table 5); the majority of grade 3 or worse adverse events 
were haematological. Table 6 shows an overview of 
adverse events at 6 months after randomisation, which

was about 1 month after completion of treatment in the 
chemoradiotherapy group. There were no treatment-
related deaths. From 12 months onwards, no significant 
differences between the groups were found in grade 3 or 
worse adverse events (appendix p 5). The number of 
patients with grade 2 or worse adverse events was 
86 (32%) for chemoradiotherapy versus 64 (24%) for 
radiotherapy at 3 years (p=0·034), and 57 (40%) versus 
38 (28%) at 5 years (p=0·033). The most significant and 
clinically relevant difference between the arms was found 
for grade 2 or worse sensory neuropathy, which persisted 
in 20 (8%) women in the chemoradiotherapy group 
versus one (1%) women in the radiotherapy group at 
3 years and 12 (9%) women versus no women at 5 years 
(both p<0·0001). An extensive overview of adverse events 
during follow-up is in the appendix (pp 4–5).
Discussion
The final results of the PORTEC-3 trial showed that the 
combination of adjuvant chemotherapy and radio-
therapy for high-risk endometrial cancer did not 
significantly 
improve 
overall 
survival. 
However, 
chemoradiotherapy did improve 5-year failure-free 
survival compared with radiotherapy alone. Patients 
with stage III disease—who had a higher risk of 
recurrence than those with stages I–II—had a HR of 
0·66 and 11% absolute improvement of failure-free 
survival with chemo-radiotherapy, which is clinically 
relevant and exceeds the 10% improvement used when 
designing the study.
The improvement in failure-free survival in the 
chemoradiotherapy group should be weighed against the 
severity and duration of toxicity of combined treatment, 
especially since overall survival was not significantly 
improved. Although significantly higher incidences of 
adverse events and reduced health-related quality of life 
were reported in the chemoradiotherapy group during 
and after treatment,9 rapid recovery was seen, with no 
differences in grade 3–4 adverse events from 12 months 
onwards. Grade 2 sensory neuropathy, however, persisted 
significantly more often in patients treated with 
chemoradiotherapy, with 25% of patients reporting 
“quite a bit” or “very much” tingling or numbness at 
2 years, compared with 6% for radiotherapy.9 Sensory 
neuropathy is associated with lower levels of functioning 
and quality of life, and more fatigue.24
For decades, standard adjuvant treatment for women 
with high-risk endometrial cancer has been pelvic 
external beam radiotherapy. It has been hypothesised 
that chemotherapy might improve survival by reducing 
the risk of metastatic disease. Randomised trials 
comparing adjuvant chemotherapy with external beam 
radiotherapy failed to show an improvement in 
progression-free 
survival 
or 
overall 
survival.6,7 
Retrospective studies reported substantial rates of pelvic 
recurrence if high-risk patients were treated without 
radiotherapy, supporting the combined use of pelvic 
radiotherapy with adjuvant chemotherapy, as first 
explored in the RTOG 9708 phase 2 trial.8,25,26
Randomised studies have compared radiotherapy with 
the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy 
in patients with high-risk endometrial cancer. The 
NSGO-EC-9501/EORTC-55991 trial compared external 
beam radiotherapy alone with external beam radiotherapy 
and four cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy, given 
sequentially before or after external beam radiotherapy. 
A pooled analysis with the ManGO Iliade 3 trial27 with a 
total cohort of 534 patients showed, in line with our results, 
improved progression-free survival (78% vs 69%, p=0·01) 
and a trend for improved survival (82% vs 75%, p=0·07) 
with the addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy alone.
The 
schedule 
of 
combined 
radiotherapy 
with 
concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy used in the 
PORTEC-3 trial seemed likely to be most effective 
because both treatments were started early after surgery 
and thus maximum benefit of the combination could be 
expected. In RTOG-9708, 4-year overall survival was 
85% and disease-free survival was 81%. A retrospective 
single institution study28 reporting on 40 patients with 
stage IIIA or IIIC endometrial cancer treated with the 
same combination of chemoradiotherapy showed 5-year 
overall survival of 85% and relapse-free survival of 79%. 
In the chemoradiotherapy group of the PORTEC-3 trial

confirming these results in a much larger trial. Overall 
and relapse-free survival in the pooled NSGO-EC-9501/
EORTC-55991/Iliade trials27 were also similar at 
82% and 78%, with only 20% patients with stage III 
disease.
High-risk endometrial cancer is heterogeneous, 
including various histological types and stages of disease. 
In the NSGO-EC-9501/EORTC-55991 trial, although 
progression-free survival was significantly improved 
for patients with endometrioid endometrial cancer, 
this improvement was not found for serous and clear 
cell cancers. A Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) 
study29 explored the associations between histology and 
outcome in advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer 
patients in chemotherapy trials in 1203 patients. 
Although serous and clear cell cancers had a worse 
prognosis than other histological types, no difference in 
benefit from chemotherapy was found. In the PORTEC-3 
trial, women with serous or clear-cell cancers had at least 
as much improvement in failure-free survival with the 
addition of chemotherapy as women with endometriod 
endometrial cancer did. When comparing serous cancers 
with other histological types, as expected, worse overall 
survival and failure-free survival were found for serous 
cancers; patients with serous cancers had a failure-free 
survival benefit with chemoradiotherapy, but this benefit 
was not significant in view of the small numbers of 
serous cancers and events.
The multivariable analysis indicated that women older 
than 70 years seemed to have a greater failure-free 
survival benefit from chemotherapy than younger 
women. Age is a well-known risk factor for endometrial 
cancer and a greater benefit of chemotherapy in older 
women has been reported previously.7,30 Although 
selection of fitter older women in this randomised trial 
might have occurred, physicians should not be reticent to 
counsel older women about the possible benefits of 
combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
Analysed by stage, patients with stage III endometrial 
cancer who have the highest frequency of recurrence, 
also had the greatest absolute benefit from the combined 
treatment. The smaller failure-free survival improvement 
for patients with stage I–II disease seems not to outweigh 
the cost in terms of toxicity and quality-of-life impairment. 
Pelvic control was high (91%) with radiotherapy alone. 
This finding is in line with the results of the GOG-249 
trial, in which patients with stage I and II endometrial 
cancer with high-intermediate or high-risk factors were 
randomly assigned to pelvic radiotherapy alone or to 
chemotherapy (three cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel) 
followed by vaginal brachytherapy. No superiority of 
three cycles chemotherapy plus vaginal brachytherapy 
over external bean radiotherapy alone was found, with 
overlapping progression-free and overall survival curves 
and significantly more pelvic and para-aortic recurrences 
in the chemotherapy group.31,32 
In 47% of all patients, a vaginal brachytherapy boost 
was given (46% for chemoradiotherapy vs 48% for 
radiotherapy); 
the 
majority 
because 
of 
cervical 
involvement and 4% because of other reasons, such as 
LVSI or grade 3 endometrial cancer. This finding is in 
line with other studies among patients with stage II–III 
endometrial cancer.33 Although the addition of a 
brachytherapy boost might have added to the good local 
control seen in both groups, we do not expect this would 
have affected the results, because the proportion of 
women receiving a brachytherapy boost was equal in the 
two treatment groups.
To compare the radiotherapy and chemotherapy 
schedule as used in the PORTEC-3 trial with 
chemotherapy alone for advanced stage endometrial 
cancer, the GOG-258 trial randomly assigned participants 
to receive chemoradiotherapy or six cycles of carboplatin 
and paclitaxel.34 Final results are pending, but a 
presented abstract34 reported no differences in overall or 
recurrence-free survival, while significantly more vaginal 
and pelvic or para-aortic recurrences were reported in 
patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Similar 
results were also reported in a retrospective multicentre 
study35 of 265 patients with stage IIIC disease treated 
with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both. Patients 
treated 
with 
chemotherapy 
alone 
were 
two 
to 
seven times more likely to develop a vaginal 
recurrence (35%) than those treated with radio-
therapy (18%) or chemoradiotherapy (5%), and twice as

likely to develop an isolated pelvic recurrence 
(18% vs 9% vs 7%). These outcomes confirm the 
importance of combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy 
to maximise vaginal and pelvic control and relapse-free 
survival. Furthermore, acute gastrointestinal and 
genitourinary toxicity of pelvic radiotherapy will be 
reduced with the current standard use of intensity-
modulated radiotherapy.36
PORTEC-3 was a multicentre trial with strong 
international collaboration among six participating 
groups and, therefore, highly representative of current 
practice worldwide. Upfront pathology review was done

to include only truly high-risk patients in the trial. 
Analysis of pathology review in the Netherlands and the 
UK (48% of PORTEC-3 participants) revealed that 8·3% 
of patients did not fulfil the eligibility criteria after 
central pathology review. These patients did not enter 
the trial.15
A limitation of this trial might be that because of the 
death and failure-free survival event rates were lower 
than expected at the time of trial design, the required 
number of overall survival events was not reached and 
the final analysis was time-based rather than event-
based, with final analysis at a median follow-up of 
5 years (42 months after inclusion of the last patient). 
The number of overall survival events was 136 (69% of 
the required number of overall survival events), and the 
number of failure-free survival events was 186 (94% of 
the required events). The non-significant difference in 
5-year overall survival of 5% found in PORTEC-3 was 
smaller than the study was powered to detect, and 
overall survival and failure-free survival probabilities

were higher than expected from previous studies. 
Long-term outcomes will be analysed, especially for 
overall survival.
The costs of chemoradiotherapy in terms of toxicity 
and treatment duration should be weighed against the 
benefits, and this cost–benefit tradeoff could be seen 
differently from the patient or physician perspective. In a 
patient preference study done by the ANZGOG group 
among PORTEC-3 participants,37 more than 50% of 
patients rated 5% survival improvement sufficient to 
make chemotherapy worthwhile. Although the trial 
results are in the range of this benefit for failure-free 
survival, the overall survival difference was not 
significant, thus individual patient counselling remains 
essential. Translational studies of molecular risk factors 
and tumour characteristics with the tumour samples of 
the PORTEC-3 participants might identify those who 
could most benefit from chemotherapy or targeted 
agents and individualise treatment of women with high-
risk endometrial cancer.38

In conclusion, although treatment with chemo-
radiotherapy significantly improved 5-year failure-free 
survival for patients with high-risk endometrial cancer 
compared with radiotherapy alone, there was no significant 
difference in overall survival. For women with stage III 
endometrial cancer, a significant improvement in failure-
free survival was found. For each patient, the cost in terms 
of increased toxicity and longer treatment duration should 
be weighed against the benefit in terms of improvement in 
failure-free survival. Because pelvic control was high with 
radiotherapy alone, this chemoradiotherapy schedule 
cannot be recommended as a new standard for patients 
with stage I–II endometrial cancer. However, in view of the 
higher risk of recurrence among women with stage III 
disease, this chemoradiotherapy schedule should be 
considered to maximise failure-free survival, and benefits 
and risks should be individually discussed.
