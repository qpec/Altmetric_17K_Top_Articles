OBJECTIVES
To evaluate the ability of the Decipher genomic classifier in predicting metastasis from analysis
of prostate needle biopsy diagnostic tumor tissue specimens.
MATERIALS AND
METHODS
Fifty-seven patients with available biopsy specimens were identified from a cohort of 169 men
treated with radical prostatectomy in a previously reported Decipher validation study at Cleve-
land Clinic. A Cox multivariable proportional hazards model and survival C-index were used to
evaluate the performance of Decipher.
RESULTS
With a median follow up of 8 years, 8 patients metastasized and 3 died of prostate cancer. The
Decipher plus National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) model had an improved C-index
of 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77-0.96) compared to NCCN alone (C-index 0.75, 95%
CI 0.64-0.87). On multivariable analysis, Decipher was the only significant predictor of metas-
tasis when adjusting for age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen and biopsy Gleason score (De-
cipher hazard ratio per 10% increase 1.72, 95% CI 1.07-2.81, P = .02).
CONCLUSION
Biopsy Decipher predicted the risk of metastasis at 10 years post radical prostatectomy. While further
validation is required on larger cohorts, preoperative knowledge of Decipher risk derived from biopsy
could indicate the need for multimodality therapy and help set patient expectations of therapeutic
burden.

A
ccurate assessment of the biological potential of
prostate cancer (PCa) at initial diagnosis is im-
portant for optimal treatment planning and de-
cision making. Increased risk of metastasis is one factor that
can influence the decision to not offer active surveil-
lance, perform an extended lymph node dissection, or use
adjuvant therapy. Decipher is an extensively validated
genomic classifier that predicts metastasis and PCa mor-
tality after radical prostatectomy (RP).1-3 Prior validation
studies evaluated the performance of Decipher using tumor
tissue obtained from RP specimens. In the present study,
we assessed the ability of the locked 22-biomarker signa-
ture, Decipher, measured on diagnostic needle biopsy speci-
mens to predict the occurrence of metastasis at 10 years
post RP, and compared its performance to tumor tissue ob-
tained from the corresponding RP specimens.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Specimen Collection and Processing
Cases were selected based on availability of prostate needle biopsy
specimens from a cohort of 169 patients treated with RP at Cleve-
land Clinic between 1987 and 2008, which were previously used
to evaluate Decipher for prediction of metastasis within 5 years
of RP.4 In that study, patients were selected if they met at least
one of the following criteria: (1) preoperative prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) >20 ng/mL, (2) stage pT3 or margin positive, or
(3) pathologic Gleason score ≥8. From this cohort, 57 patients
who had both preoperative diagnostic needle biopsy specimens
and matched RP specimens for genomic analysis were selected.
The study was approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional
Review Board.
All tissues used in the study were rereviewed by an expert geni-
tourinary pathologist (CMG) and graded according to 2005 In-
ternational Society of Urological Pathology criteria.5 RNA was
extracted from diagnostic biopsy specimens from the core with
at least 1 mm of the highest Gleason pattern and linear length
of tumor; for RP specimens, the block with the highest grade was
used.4 Twenty-five to 100 ng of RNA from each specimen was
amplified for transcriptome-wide microarray expression analysis

formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues from the 1980s and 1990s
was 269.5 ng (interquartile range [IQR] 112.0-537.1 ng) and

Calculation of Risk Models
The Stephenson post RP, Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assess-
ment Postsurgical (CAPRA-S) Score clinical models and Deci-
pher scores were calculated as described previously.4,6,7
Statistical Analysis
The primary objective of the present study was to validate biopsy
Decipher for prediction of metastasis within 10 years after RP.
Secondary objectives included validation of Decipher for pre-
diction of primary Gleason pattern 4 or greater on RP speci-
men, pT3 disease (extraprostatic extension or seminal vesicle
invasion), and rapid metastasis (RM, metastasis within 5 years
post RP). Statistical analyses were performed in R v3.1 (R Foun-
dation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), with all tests
of significance as 2-sided at the 0.05 level. Taking into account
the small sample size and number of events, Firth’s penalized like-
lihood Cox regression method was used to evaluate the perfor-
mance of Decipher in univariable and multivariable analyses.8 This
method ensures the robustness of the analyses with a small number
of events to avoid overestimation of the resulting estimates. Least
absolute shrinkage and selection operation (LASSO) was also used
to determine the most important variables in the multivariable
analysis (MVA).9 Time-dependent C-indices were constructed
using the nearest neighbor estimator described by Heagerty et al.10
with a span parameter of 0.001. The C-index of the combined
models was estimated by subjecting the model to bootstrapping
with 1000 resamples. For secondary end points, logistic regres-
sion analysis was used.
RESULTS
Demographic, clinical, and follow-up data of the patient
cohort are provided in Table 1. The median year of surgery
was 1998 (IQR 1994-2002) and the median patient age
at RP was 62 years (IQR 58-67). The median preopera-
tive PSA was 6.3 ng/mL (IQR 5.1-11.1); 63% had clini-
cal stage T1c; and 61% had a biopsy Gleason score of 6,
mirroring the demographic, clinical, and pathologic char-
acteristics of our entire population of RP patients oper-
ated on in this era.7 Based on National Comprehensive
Cancer Network (NCCN) risk categories, 40%, 47%, and
7% of patients had low-, intermediate- and high-risk dis-
eases, respectively. Of the 57 patients, 8 (14%) devel-
oped metastasis and 11 died, including 3 (5%) from PCa
and 8 (14%) from non-PCa causes. The median follow-
up of the censored patients was 8 years (IQR 6-11).
The median Decipher score on biopsy specimens was 0.38
(IQR 0.29-0.49). Based on previously established cutoffs,
38 (67%) had low (<0.45), 14 (25%) had intermediate
(0.45-0.60), and 5 (9%) had high (>0.60) Decipher scores
(Fig. 1). Overall, 46% of NCCN risk group patients were
reclassified as lower or higher Decipher risk (Table 2). Patho-
logic details for the RP specimens are provided in Table 3.
Twenty-five patients (44%) were upgraded to Gleason 3 + 4
or greater, 36 (63%) had extraprostatic extension, 6 (11%)
had seminal vesicle invasion, and 44 (77%) were CAPRA-S
intermediate- or high-risk. The median Decipher score on
the RPs was 0.29 (IQR 0.18-0.44), and 75%, 11%, and 13%
had low, intermediate, and high Decipher scores, respec-
tively. Overall, Decipher scores on tumor derived from the
RPs reclassified 62% of CAPRA-S risk groups into lower-
or higher-risk categories (Supplementary Table S1).
For the primary end point of the presence of metastasis
within 10 years after RP, biopsy Decipher had a C-index
of 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58-0.95) com-
pared to 0.75 (95% CI 0.64-0.87) for the NCCN risk group
(Fig. 2). A combined model of Decipher plus NCCN had
an improved C-index of 0.88 (95% CI 0.76-0.96). In a sen-
sitivity analysis, we determined the C-index at other time
points (ie, 5-10 years post RP), which showed consistent
C-index values (Supplementary Figure S1). On univariable
analysis, only a biopsy Gleason score of ≥8 (hazard ratio
[HR] = 8.6, 95% CI 1.42-55.98, P = .02) and biopsy De-
cipher (HR = 1.85 per 10% increase, 95% CI 1.22-2.87,
P = .004) were significant predictors of metastasis (Table 4).
On MVA with clinical risk factors, biopsy Decipher re-
mained a significant predictor of metastasis (HR = 1.72 per
10% increase, 95% CI 1.07-2.81, P = .02). LASSO regres-
sion showed that biopsy Decipher and biopsy Gleason score
were the remaining variables in the model when the penalty
parameter was optimized (Supplementary Figure S2). Similar
results were observed when we modeled Decipher with the
rereviewed biopsy Gleason score (Supplementary Table S2).
Biopsy Decipher remained significant when modeled with

cipher was also a significant predictor for two of the sec-
ondary end points, including primary Gleason grade 4 or
greater (C-index = 0.71, 95% CI 0.56-0.86) and rapid me-
tastasis (C-index = 0.87, 95% CI 0.76-0.97), but not for
pT3 disease (Supplementary Table S4). Similar results were
observed for RP Decipher (Supplementary Figure S3,
Supplementary Tables S5, S6).
COMMENT
In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that
a robust genomic classifier previously validated to predict
the risk of metastasis at 10 years after RP measured on pros-
tatectomy tissue1,4 holds similar predictive ability when mea-
sured on preoperative diagnostic biopsies from the same
prostates. Using C-index and MVA, biopsy Decipher out-
performed NCCN clinical risk grouping, biopsy Gleason
score, and preoperative PSA; for every 10% increase in the
Decipher score, the HR increased by 1.72. Notably, com-
bining Decipher with NCCN risk groups increased the
C-index from 0.75 to 0.88, suggesting that Decipher cap-
tures a considerable portion of PCa biology available on
diagnostic needle biopsies obtained in routine clinical prac-
tice. Biopsy Decipher scores were also predictive of other
key outcomes, including the presence of primary Gleason
pattern 4/5 disease and an elevated risk of metastasis within
5 years.

genomic markers4,11,12 showing that meaningful and

 clinically actionable biologic information can be obtained
from routine diagnostic biopsies. We have recently out-
lined a new “Genomic Paradigm” for the use of such in-
formation in the selection and management of patients for
active surveillance,13 and clinical utility studies have con-
firmed that use of such tests can increase the percentage of
patients in each NCCN risk group who choose to go on
active surveillance.14 Based on published work demon-
strating that patients with high Decipher scores in RP speci-
mens benefit from adjuvant rather than salvage radiation
therapy,15 preoperative knowledge of Decipher status derived
frombiopsycouldindicatetheneedformultimodalitytherapy
and help set patient expectations of therapeutic burden.
This observation is emphasized by the fact that 5 of the 8
patients in this study who developed metastatic disease did
so within 5 years, suggesting that Decipher can identify those
with the most aggressive disease in need of intensified therapy.
The strengths of our study include use of biopsy tissue
obtained in routine clinical practice, expert pathologic
review and tissue harvesting, and use of a robust measure
of tumor biology, a hard and meaningful clinical end point
(metastases), and reasonable follow-up time. The main
weakness of the present study is the relatively small sample
size and low event rate, although this was mitigated by the
use of Firth’s penalized likelihood Cox regression method
and LASSO regression to avoid overfitting. Another limi-
tation of our study was the high rate of patients with clini-
cal stage T1c tumor, which prevented us from including

tation by fitting a multivariable model with NCCN and
biopsy Decipher.
CONCLUSION
Biopsy Decipher predicted the risk of metastasis at 5- and
10-years post RP. While further validation is required on
larger cohorts, our findings strongly suggest that Deci-
pher could be a useful tool at diagnosis for improved local
therapy planning for newly diagnosed PCa patients.
