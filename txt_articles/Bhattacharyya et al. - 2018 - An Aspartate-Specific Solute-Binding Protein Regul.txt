ABSTRACT
Signaling by serine/threonine phosphorylation controls diverse pro-
cesses in bacteria, and identification of the stimuli that activate protein kinases is an
outstanding question in the field. Recently, we showed that nutrients stimulate
phosphorylation of the protein kinase G substrate GarA in Mycobacterium smegmatis
and Mycobacterium tuberculosis and that the action of GarA in regulating central me-
tabolism depends upon whether it is phosphorylated. Here we present an investiga-
tion into the mechanism by which nutrients activate PknG. Two unknown genes
were identified as co-conserved and co-expressed with PknG: their products were a
putative lipoprotein, GlnH, and putative transmembrane protein, GlnX. Using a ge-
netic approach, we showed that the membrane protein GlnX is functionally linked to
PknG. Furthermore, we determined that the ligand specificity of GlnH matches the
amino acids that stimulate GarA phosphorylation. We determined the structure of
GlnH in complex with different amino acid ligands (aspartate, glutamate, and aspara-
gine), revealing the structural basis of ligand specificity. We propose that the amino
acid concentration in the periplasm is sensed by GlnH and that protein-protein in-
teraction allows transmission of this information across the membrane via GlnX to
activate PknG. This sensory system would allow regulation of nutrient utilization in
response to changes in nutrient availability. The sensor, signaling, and effector pro-
teins are conserved throughout the Actinobacteria, including the important human
pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, industrial amino acid producer Corynebacte-
rium glutamicum, and antibiotic-producing Streptomyces species.
IMPORTANCE
Tuberculosis (TB) kills 5,000 people every day, and the prevalence of
multidrug-resistant TB is increasing in every country. The processes by which the
pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis senses and responds to changes in its environ-
ment are attractive targets for drug development. Bacterial metabolism differs dra-
matically between growing and dormant cells, and these changes are known to be
important in pathogenesis of TB. Here, we used genetic and biochemical approaches
to identify proteins that allow M. tuberculosis to detect amino acids in its surround-
ings so that it can regulate its metabolism. We have also shown how individual
amino acids are recognized. The findings have broader significance for other actino-
bacterial pathogens, such as nontuberculous mycobacteria, as well as Actinobacteria
used to produce billions of dollars of amino acids and antibiotics every year.

utrient sensing is central to the ability of bacteria to adapt to changing environ-
mental conditions. Both intracellular and extracellular molecules are sensed in
order to regulate fundamental processes such as primary metabolism, motility, and cell
division. Multiple mechanisms control gene expression and protein activity in response
to these stimuli, and both transcriptional regulation and posttranslational modification
are recognized as important (1). Among the many forms of posttranslational modifi-
cation, protein phosphorylation is ubiquitous (2). Protein kinase G (PknG) stands out
among bacterial serine/threonine protein kinases (STPKs) because of its wide conser-
vation in the Actinobacteria and the wealth of information on its requirement for
virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (3–5) and its role in glutamate overproduction
by the industrial organism Corynebacterium glutamicum (6). The downstream effects of
PknG activity include well-characterized effects on the activity of enzymes involved in
the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glutamate metabolism (7, 8).
Identification of stimuli and mechanisms of activation are outstanding questions for
bacterial STPKs (9). Based on the striking changes in amino acid metabolism caused by
pknG disruption in multiple organisms (M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and
C. glutamicum) (3, 6, 10), we recently tested for nutrient conditions that lead to
PknG-dependent phosphorylation of the regulatory protein GarA. GarA was unphos-
phorylated in M. tuberculosis or M. smegmatis cells that were starved of amino acids, but
became phosphorylated when cells were exposed to media containing amino acids
(10). Glutamate and aspartate were identified as the stimuli that lead to rapid phos-
phorylation of GarA (10).
The mechanism of PknG activation by amino acids is unknown. Unlike receptor
kinases, such as PknB, where binding of ligands to extracellular domains stimulates
intracellular kinase activity, PknG lacks any secretion signal, transmembrane helix, or
extracellular domains, so it is unlikely to bind directly to external nutrients. The crystal
structure of PknG did not reveal likely amino acid binding sites, implying that activation
requires accessory components (11). In addition to its kinase domain, PknG has three
further domains: the N-terminal domain is rich in autophosphorylation sites (8), the
rubredoxin domain has a metal coordinated by four cysteines (11), and the C-terminal
domain is made up of tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), a motif that frequently binds
peptides or proteins (12). Deletion of these domains had a complex effect on the
activity of recombinant PknG, suggesting that they regulate kinase activity by a mix of
activatory and repressive functions (13). The activity of recombinant PknG has further
been shown to be modulated by the metal-binding site of the rubredoxin domain:
activity was enhanced by oxidation (14) and inhibited by nitro-alkylation (15).
In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which amino acids could activate
PknG. Our data show that two accessory proteins encoded in the PknG operon are
required for PknG activation: GlnX and GlnH. The conserved aspartate-specific solute-
binding protein (SBP) GlnH links extracellular amino acid concentration to PknG activity
via the periplasmic transmembrane protein GlnX, thereby controlling glutamate me-
tabolism in Mycobacterium spp.
RESULTS
PknG activation by glutamate is indirect and dependent on its protein inter-
action domain (TPR domain). Based on the observation that glutamate stimulated
PknG to phosphorylate GarA in M. smegmatis cells (10), we tested whether glutamate
would increase the rate of phosphorylation of GarA by recombinant PknG (Fig. 1A). The
rate of GarA phosphorylation matched previous measurements (8) and was indepen-
dent of glutamate (Fig. 1A). This correlates with the lack of amino acid binding sites
identified by sequence and structural analyses of PknG (11, 13) and led us to hypoth-
esize that glutamate activates PknG via an indirect mechanism, such as interaction with
additional proteins. All PknG homologues have a potential protein-protein interaction
domain since the conserved C terminus is made up of tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs)
(Fig. 1B), a motif associated with protein-protein interactions (12).

 To investigate the domains required for the function of PknG, we used a previously
characterized pknG-disrupted mutant strain of M. smegmatis (16). This strain grows
normally in standard mixed medium, but grows slowly with clumps when glutamate is
the sole nitrogen source (10).
Protein domain boundaries were identified from previous structural and biochem-
ical characterization of M. tuberculosis (13). PknG and plasmids were constructed for
expression of truncated versions of PknG (Fig. 1C). Expression of all versions of PknG
was detected by Western blotting (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material), and all
strains grew normally on mixed medium (Fig. S1B). Full-length PknG and truncation
mutants that included the TPR domain improved the growth on glutamate, but
truncation mutants that lacked the TPR domain did not improve growth (Fig. 1C). These
data suggest that the TPR domain is required for the role of PknG in regulating
glutamate metabolism—probably by mediating interactions with other protein(s).
Notably the TPR domain is conserved in all PknG homologues, but the N-terminal
domain is weakly conserved and the rubredoxin domain is absent from the Coryne-
bacteriacaea (Fig. 1B).
PknG is encoded in a conserved operon and functionally linked to transmem-
brane sensor protein GlnX. To identify putative interaction partners that could
activate PknG, we analyzed the genomic region of pknG. The operon structure in
M. tuberculosis, M. smegmatis, and C. glutamicum has been described previously: PknG
is encoded with a predicted lipoprotein and a predicted transmembrane protein
(Fig. 2A) (3, 6). This operon arrangement is conserved in the Actinomycetales and other
Actinobacteria that have PknG homologues (Fig. 2B).
The lipoprotein was named GlnH due to homology with a solute-binding protein
involved in glutamine transport by Escherichia coli (26% amino acid identity [17]).
FIG 1 PknG activation by glutamate was indirect, and PknG function required the conserved protein interaction domain (TPR domain). (A) Kinase
activity of recombinant PknG toward GarA was independent of glutamate. Kinase reactions in the presence or absence of glutamate were sampled
at the indicated times. Phosphorylation of GarA was detected by the known decrease in mobility of phospho-GarA in SDS-PAGE (8, 10). The rate
of GarA phosphorylation was similar to that seen in previous studies of PknG and was unchanged by the addition of glutamate. Images are
representative of three independent experiments. Similar results were obtained with other putative activators: glutamine, aspartate, and
�-ketoglutarate. (B) PknG homologues from Actinomycetales have a variable N-terminal domain, sometimes lack the Rdx domain (absent from
homologues in the Corynebacteriaceae), and always have a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. (C) Truncated PknG lacking the Rdx was able
to restore the ability of pknG-deficient M. smegmatis to grow on minimal medium containing glutamate as the sole nitrogen source, but truncated
PknG lacking the TPR domain did not improve growth. Error bars show standard deviations from three wells, and the growth curve is
representative of three independent experiments.

 However, glnH disruption did not affect glutamine uptake by C. glutamicum, suggesting
that it has been misclassified (6). Both GlnH and the unknown transmembrane protein
GlnX were annotated as putative sensory proteins in the microbial signal transduction
database MiST (18). GlnX is predicted to have two sensor-like four-helix bundles in the
periplasm (pfam12729 accession no. 4HB_MCP_1), similar to the four-helix bundles of
nutrient sensors involved in chemotaxis like the Tar protein of E. coli (Fig. 2C). We
speculated that GlnX and GlnH could bind each other, similar to Tar receptor interac-
tion with the solute-binding protein maltose-binding protein (MBP) (19, 20) and
trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)-binding protein with sensor histidine kinase TorS (21).
In this arrangement, transmembrane GlnX would link periplasmic GlnH to cytoplasmic
PknG, allowing PknG to phosphorylate cytoplasmic GarA. The putative interaction
between GlnX and PknG would provide an explanation for the cell envelope localiza-
tion of PknG (22), despite PknG lacking secretion signals or transmembrane domains
(SignalP v4.0 [23]). The cytoplasmic termini of GlnX (35 and 6 amino acids at the N
terminus and C terminus, respectively) would be typical of the extended peptide
partners often recognized by TPR domains (24, 25).
To test whether GlnX is functionally linked to PknG and a candidate for activating
PknG, we constructed an unmarked glnX deletion mutant strain of M. smegmatis. The
strain copied the phenotype of pknG-disrupted M. smegmatis: normal growth on mixed
medium, with a specific defect in glutamate utilization that could be restored by
reintroduction of plasmid-borne glnX (Fig. 2D; see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material).
This finding correlates with earlier evidence from C. glutamicum, where glnX and glnH
mutations led to a similar amino acid utilization defect as a pknG mutant, although
complementation data are not available for the earlier study (6).
GlnH bound Asp, Glu, and Asn, the same amino acids that stimulate GarA
phosphorylation in mycobacteria. GlnH belongs to the solute-binding protein family,
specifically the polar amino acid binding family, which bind to arginine, cysteine,
histidine, glutamine, glutamate, and aspartate (26). In general, this family is too diverse
to predict the ligand specificity of GlnH, so specificity was determined using recombi-
nant protein. Binding of putative ligands to soluble M. tuberculosis GlnH (lacking the
secretion and lipoylation sequence in amino acids 1 to 20) was measured by a thermal
melt-shift assay, in which protein denaturation is measured in the presence and
absence of ligand. Addition of aspartate, glutamate, or asparagine increased the

promoter, and the three genes are co-expressed (49). (B) The structure of the PknG operon is conserved widely in the Actinomycetales (STRING database [42]).
(C) The transmembrane segments and membrane topology of GlnX were predicted using TMHMM (38), and putative four-helix bundle sensory domains (4HB)
were detected using pfam (39). Putative transmembrane helices are shown in black, cytoplasmic regions in orange, and periplasmic regions in blue. (D) Deletion
of glnX from M. smegmatis mirrored the phenotype of pknG-deficient M. smegmatis: a defect in utilization of glutamate as the sole nitrogen source. Growth of
glnX-deficient M. smegmatis was restored by reintroduction of glnX. Error bars represent standard deviations from three wells, and the growth curve is
representative of three independent experiments.

 thermal stability of GlnH, suggesting that these are ligands for GlnH (Fig. 3A and B).
Addition of cysteine or histidine also led to a modest but statistically significant effect,
while other amino acids had no significant effect on the melting temperature. Aspartate
led to the greatest stabilization by �10°
C. Binding of GlnH and Asp was confirmed by
isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (Fig. 3C), allowing measurement of the dissocia-
tion constant (Kd) as 4.8 �M (Table 1). This implies that GlnH might be fully occupied
by Asp when M. tuberculosis escapes to the cytoplasm of infected macrophages but is
potentially unoccupied in the phagosome. The affinity of GlnH for Asp is relatively weak
compared to typical bacterial amino acid transport proteins (Kd � 1 nM to 2 �M [27,
28]), while mammalian N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and metabotropic Glu receptors
show a range of affinities for glutamate (50% effective concentration [EC50] of 20 nM to
1 mM, although many have EC50s of 1 to 10 �M [29, 30]).
To determine whether the amino acid specificity of the GlnH sensor is conserved in
other Actinobacteria, we prepared recombinant GlnH from C. glutamicum (43% amino
acid identity). The thermal melt-shift assays (Fig. 3D) confirmed that both aspartate and
glutamate stabilized GlnH. Furthermore, addition of Asp or Glu to GlnH led to an
increase in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 3E; see Fig. S3 in the supplemental
material), revealing that C. glutamicum GlnH binds Asp and Glu with lower affinity than
M. tuberculosis GlnH (Table 1). The weaker amino acid binding by C. glutamicum than

C. glutamicum GlnH was measured by changes in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Error bars represent standard deviations from at least three
measurements. Graphs are representative of three independent experiments.

 M. tuberculosis GlnH could reflect differences in the niche and metabolism of these
organisms, thus allowing C. glutamicum to respond to changing concentrations of
aspartate and glutamate in amino acid-rich environments. C. glutamicum 13032 was
originally isolated from soil contaminated with avian feces and was found to secrete up
to 75 mM glutamate (now �500 mM in industrial fermentations). Strains of C. glutami-
cum have also been isolated from diverse environments, including soil, feces, dairy
products, plant tissue, and animal skin, some of which are poor and others rich in free
amino acids (�5 �M to �100 �M) (31).
Structure of GlnH. To determine how GlnH recognizes its ligands, the structure of
GlnH in complex with aspartate was determined by X-ray crystallography. The fold of
GlnH is related to bacterial solute-binding proteins from ATP transporters and to the
sensor domains of glutamate receptors: two lobes close around the Asp ligand in a
Venus flytrap-like arrangement (Fig. 4). Each lobe has an �/� structure with a central
parallel � sheet sandwiched by � helices. The Asp ligand is buried at the interface
between the two lobes and makes contacts with both lobes.
The amine and carboxyl groups of the Asp ligand are charge neutralized and
stabilized by the side chains of Ser 164, Arg 169, and Asp 250 (Fig. 5A), which are
conserved in structurally related amino acid binding proteins of diverse specificities
(Fig. 6A) (26, 32). The side-chain carboxyl group of the Asp ligand makes hydrogen
bonds with the side chains of Arg 147, Trp 232, and Thr 162 (Fig. 5B and C), and these
are conserved in solute-binding proteins that have the same ligand specificity as GlnH
(Fig. 6B; see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). The side chain of the Asp ligand also
contacts Lys 161 via water.

 To determine the structural basis of discrimination between higher- and lower-
affinity ligands, GlnH was crystallized in the presence of Glu and Asn. Overall, the
structures with different ligands bound were similar (Fig. 7A; root mean square devi-
ation [RMSD] � 0.199 Å over 1,727 main-chain atoms). The greatest difference is in
loops 99 to 103 and 109 to 113 (DIGSN and DPITG, respectively), which are displaced
2 Å in the Glu- or Asn-bound structures compared to the Asp-bound structure (Fig. 7A).
The conformations of the ligand binding site and positioning of the ligands are similar
(Fig. 7B to E). Asn is unable to form a hydrogen bond with Trp 232, providing an
explanation for the difference in affinity of binding (Fig. 3B and 7D). Contacts between
GlnH and Glu are the same as those between GlnH and Asp, with the liganded Glu
adopting a bent conformation such that the side-chain carboxyl group occupies the
equivalent position to the side chain of ligand Asp in the GlnH-Asp complex (Fig. 7D).
The bent conformation of the Glu ligand is similar to that observed in another bacterial

 solute-binding protein from Enterococcus faecium (5eyf [Fig. S4]), but different from the
extended conformation of Glu seen in mammalian glutamate receptors (see Fig. S5 in
the supplemental material). Overall, there is greater conservation of ligand contacts
between GlnH and bacterial ABC transporter proteins (Peb1a with Asp and 2eyf with
Glu) than with eukaryotic glutamate receptor proteins with glutamate (Fig. S4 and S5).
Sequence alignment of GlnH homologues that are also genetically linked to PknG
(Fig. 6B) shows that within the order Actinomycetales (which includes important human
and animal pathogens like Mycobacterium leprae and Rhodococcus equi), conservation
of the residues that contact the R group of the Asp/Glu ligand predicts that these
proteins are also likely to be specific for Asp and Glu.
Conformational change of SBP proteins is integral to their function as sensors, with
unliganded proteins having a flexible conformation and ligands typically stabilizing a
closed conformation, called a “Venus flytrap mechanism” (26). Our structures of ligan-
ded GlnH represent “closed” conformations. We used limited trypsin proteolysis to
investigate whether unliganded GlnH is more flexible (and therefore susceptible to
proteolysis) than GlnH with Asp. The results suggest that binding of Asp provokes
conformational change in GlnH (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental material).
DISCUSSION
We have identified a genetic and functional linkage between PknG, GlnX, and GlnH
and demonstrated a correlation between the amino acids that bind GlnH and those
that stimulate PknG phosphorylation of GarA. This suggests a model of sensing and
signal transduction by which GlnH and GlnX could activate PknG in response to
aspartate or glutamate (Fig. 8). Thus, the presence of amino acids would switch enzyme
regulation to allow the organism to degrade amino acids through the TCA cycle.
The mechanism of PknG activation is thought to involve two processes: autophos-
phorylation of the N-terminal domain, which provides binding sites to recruit the
substrate GarA, and displacement of the N-terminal and rubredoxin domains, which
restrict substrate access to the catalytic site (13). This is compatible with our model, in

 which GlnX interacts with the TPR domain to induce activation of conformational
changes in PknG. Although the TPR domain is located 20 Å from the catalytic site (11),
there are direct interactions between the N- and C-terminal domains of PknG (11, 13)
(see Fig. S7 in the supplemental material) that may stabilize the inhibitory position of
the rubredoxin domain. GlnX could thus trigger activation by altering the repressive
positioning of the rubredoxin domain to allow substrate access and autophosphory-
lation.
The TPR domain of PknG homologues has a variable number of TPRs with weak
sequence conservation. Only 36 of the 345 residues are invariant, and 20 of these line
a groove in the concave face (Fig. S7), with another cluster at the C-terminal tip of the
TPR domain. These surfaces represent candidate binding sites for GlnX: indeed, the
concave face is the binding site for peptide ligands of TPR domains of other proteins.
In the PknG inhibitor structure (11), the groove is occupied by a linker that connects the
catalytic and TPR domains. GlnX might displace this linker, which would disrupt the
interactions that link the N and C termini of PknG and hence displace the rubredoxin
domain. However, further structures of full-length PknG and complexes of PknG with
GlnX will be required to determine the structural changes associated with kinase
activation.
Our model would represent a new role for the SBP family as sensors for serine/
threonine protein kinases, in addition to the known roles in solute transport and as
sensors for histidine kinases, G protein-coupled receptors, and ion channels (33). The
model applies to many medically and industrially important bacteria, since the genetic
linkage of GlnH with PknG is widely conserved in the Actinobacteria. The GlnH struc-
tures and sequence alignments allow us to predict that all PknG-linked GlnH homo-
logues bind amino acids, and those within the order Actinomycetales are likely to be
specific for Asp/Glu.
There is conflicting evidence about the subcellular localization of PknG: it has been
detected in cytoplasm and cell envelope of M. tuberculosis (34), cell envelope of
Mycobacterium marinum (22), and the cytosol of macrophages infected with Mycobac-
terium bovis BCG (4). Association of PknG with the membrane of mycobacteria might
reflect the interaction with GlnX. The possibility that PknG shuttles between the
periplasmic space and the cytoplasm to sense local amino acid concentrations directly
can be excluded because PknG alone is insensitive to amino acids (Fig. 1); rather it
FIG 8
Model of sensing of periplasmic aspartate by GlnH: Asp leads to activation of PknG and
derepression of the TCA cycle. In the absence of extracellular amino acids, GarA inhibits catabolism of
glutamate through the TCA cycle. In contrast, the presence of aspartate causes conformational change
of the sensor GlnH, leading to conformational change of GlnX that activates PknG. PknG becomes
autophosphorylated and phosphorylates GarA, thus relieving inhibition of the TCA cycle.

 requires GlnH and GlnX to transmit information across the inner membrane of the cell
to the cytoplasmic face, where PknG phosphorylates GarA (located in the cytoplasm).
Other stimuli of PknG activity apart from amino acids have been reported: oxidative
stress sensed by the rubredoxin domain (14). Stimuli that change the structure of the
rubredoxin domain could remove the restriction on substrate access to the active site
(13). In our experiments using M. smegmatis in minimal medium, we found that amino
acids were the strongest stimulus for phosphorylation (10), but additional factors also
influenced phosphorylation to a lesser extent, suggesting that PknG may respond to
multiple stimuli. The multidomain structure of PknG makes it a plausible candidate to
integrate multiple signals. GlnX is another candidate sensor for additional sensory
inputs as it is homologous to the E. coli Tar receptor, which binds both protein and
small molecule activators (19, 20). Fitting with its activation by multiple stimuli, PknG
also has multiple substrates and may regulate other processes in addition to regulation
of the TCA cycle via GarA (5, 35).
TPR domains have been identified in kinases from multiple bacterial phyla (�1,000
listed in Interpro [36]), suggesting that TPR-mediated protein interaction could be a
widespread regulatory mechanism of bacterial serine/threonine protein kinases. Acti-
vation of serine/threonine protein kinases by solute-binding proteins may also be
widespread, as there are further examples beyond PknG of serine/threonine protein
kinases genetically linked to solute-binding proteins (for example, Streptomyces griseus
SGR_4432 and Streptomyces coelicolor SCO1468), and also genes that encode both
kinase and SBP domains in a single polypeptide. (MSMEG_1200 is an example that is
conserved in multiple Mycobacterium and Streptomyces species; Interpro lists a further
260 SBP kinases.) PknG stands out from the examples mentioned above by its wide
conservation in diverse bacteria.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
PknG activity assay. GarA phosphorylation was detected by the change in mobility of phosphor-
ylated GarA in SDS-PAGE, as previously (8, 10). Recombinant hexahistidine-tagged PknG and GarA of
M. tuberculosis were purified as described previously (8). Reaction mixtures contained 175 nM PknG,
7.7 mM GarA, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2 and 0 or 10 mM glutamate (sodium
salt). Reactions were started by the addition of 0.1 mM ATP, and mixtures were incubated at 37°
C.
Aliquots were taken after 2, 10, and 30 min, stopped by addition of 1% SDS, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE
with Coomassie staining. Images are representative of three independent experiments.
Growth of M. smegmatis. M. smegmatis wild-type strain mc2155 and mutant strains were cultured
in Middlebrook 7H9 broth supplemented with 0.05% Tween 80 and 10% ADN (0.5% bovine serum
albumin, 0.2% dextrose, 0.085% NaCl) and Middlebrook 7H10 agar with 10% ADN. Middlebrook provides
a mixture of carbon and nitrogen sources (glycerol, glucose, NH4Cl, glutamate, and Tween). When
required, antibiotics were added: 100 �g/ml hygromycin and 30 �g/ml kanamycin.
Growth assay for the ability of truncated PknG to complement pknG-deficient M. smegmatis.
The pknG-disrupted (ΔpknG) M. smegmatis mutant, containing the hygromycin resistance cassette (16),
was previously shown to be deficient in glutamate utilization (16). Plasmid-based expression of either
M. smegmatis or M. tuberculosis PknG restored the defect (16). Truncated PknG was cloned in the
EcoRI/HindIII sites of pMV261 and verified by sequencing. (pMV261 is an episomal shuttle vector with a
kanamycin resistance cassette and an hsp60 promoter for constitutive expression of the introduced
genes [37].) Plasmids were introduced to the M. smegmatis ΔpknG mutant by electroporation. Expression
was verified by Western blotting using an antibody raised against recombinant M. tuberculosis PknG
(Cambridge BioScience) and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Sigma). These strains of M. smeg-
matis were tested for their growth on standard mixed medium (7H9) or minimal medium containing
glutamate (10 mM) as the sole nitrogen source as described previously (10).
Protein sequence analysis. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of PknG, GlnX, GlnH, and homo-
logues used TMHMM (38), pfam (39), Clustal Omega (40, 41), and STRING (42).
Construction of the unmarked M. smegmatis glnX mutant. An in-frame, unmarked glnX deletion
mutant was constructed by homologous recombination, using a published method (43). Counterselec-
tion (2% sucrose and 80 �g ml�1 X-Gal [5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-�-D-galactopyranoside]) was used to
identify putative double-crossover unmarked deletion mutants, which were verified by PCR. A comple-
mentation vector was constructed by cloning M. smegmatis glnX with its cognate promoter into pMV306.
pMV306 is an integrative plasmid in which the expression cassette of pMV361 has been replaced by a
multiple cloning site (37).
Expression and purification of GlnH. The signal sequence of GlnH, as identified using SignalP (10),
is followed by a lipobox motif (residues 23 to 26 [LASC]). The region encoding the predicted soluble
domain of GlnH (codon 27 onwards) was amplified from genomic DNA of M. tuberculosis H37Rv (forward
primer TACTTCCAATCCATGGGCCACTCGGAAACGCTG and reverse primer TATCCACCTTTACTGTCAGTCCA
CATACCTCGGCGT) and cloned inserted into an expression vector derived from pET-43.1a(�) (Novagen)

 fused with an N-terminal His6 tag (BD In-Fusion PCR cloning kit; Clontech). Sequence-verified plasmid
was transformed into Escherichia coli Shuffle cells (New England Biolabs) and grown on Luria agar (LA)
with 100 �g/ml ampicillin at 30°
C. Transformed cells were grown in Luria broth (LB) with 100 �g/ml
ampicillin at 30°
C with shaking. Expression was induced using 0.2 mM IPTG (isopropyl-�-D-
thiogalactopyranoside) at 20°
C for 18 h. GlnH was purified using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) resin in
50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)–150 mM NaCl and then by size exclusion chromatography in 20 mM Tris-acetate
(pH 7.5)–20 mM NaCl. GlnH eluted from Superdex 75 (16/60) in the fractions corresponding to the
predicted size of monomeric protein (35,455 Da, eluting in fractions at 62 to 64 ml). Protein was
concentrated to 8 mg/ml and stored at �80°
C.
Expression and purification of GlnHcg. The gene encoding the soluble domain of the GlnH
homologue from C. glutamicum (GlnHcg) was amplified from genomic DNA of C. glutamicum ATCC 13032
using primers GlnHcg1 and GlnHcg2 (AACATATGACTCCAACACCTGTGGAACC and TTCTCGAGTTATCCTT
CATCGTTTTCTGTC, respectively) and cloned into the NdeI/XhoI sites of pET15b (Novagen), giving an
N-terminal His6 tag. The protocol for protein expression and purification was identical to that of GlnH,
with the exception that phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used for metal affinity purification.
Measurement of the effects of amino acids on GlnH thermal stability. Amino acids were chosen
for testing as ligand candidates by examining the ligands of the most closely related structures in the
PDB (solute-binding protein cluster F4 [26]): Asp, Glu, Asn, Gln, Cys, His, Arg, and Lys, as well as the
controls Ala and Gly.
GlnH or GlnHcg (0.15 mg/ml) was mixed on ice with SyPro orange dye (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted
1:10,000 in 100 mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.5), and putative ligands were added to 10 mM. Using a quantitative
PCR (qPCR) machine, fluorescence was recorded as the temperature was increased from 4 to 90°
C
(excitation, 470 nm; emission, 570 nm). The temperature at the midpoint of thermal denaturation was
determined by taking the first differential of fluorescence versus temperature in the transition (greatest
rate of change of fluorescence).
Measurement of amino acid binding to GlnH by isothermal titration calorimetry. Binding of Asp
and Glu to GlnH was measured by microcalorimetry using a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal) with GlnH
at 20 mM in 100 mM HEPES (pH 7)–50 mM NaCl and injections of 2 mM Asp or Glu into the same buffer.
Measurement of the effects of amino acids on intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of GlnH.
Intrinsic fluorescence (excitation, 292 nm; emission, at 340 nm) of GlnHcg (0.15 mg/ml) was measured in
phosphate-buffered saline at a range of concentrations of amino acid ligand. The dissociation constant
of GlnH for amino acids was calculated by fitting fluorescence data to a one-site binding equation.
Structure determination of GlnH. Crystals were grown by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method
by mixing equal volumes (1 �l plus 1 �l) of protein and reservoir solution. Crystals of GlnH were grown
in a mixture of 20% polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000), 0.1 M MES (morpholineethanesulfonic acid
[pH 6]), and 0.2 M MgCl2 at 25°
C with 10 mM sodium aspartate (pH 7.0), sodium glutamate (pH 7.0), or
asparagine. Crystals were transferred to the reservoir solution plus 30% glycerol before being stored in
liquid nitrogen.
Diffraction data were collected at Diamond Light Source and were processed with iMosflm. Phases
were determined by molecular replacement with Phaser (44), using the structure of Campylobacter jejuni
Asp-binding protein PEB1 as a search model (31% amino acid identity; PDB accession no. 2V25 [45]).
Models were optimized using cycles of manual refinement with Coot and refinement in Refmac5 (46),
part of the CCP4 software suite (47), and in Phenix (48). Data collection and refinement statistics are
included in Table S1 in the supplemental material.
Molecular graphics were generated using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.7.4.0,
Schrödinger, LLC (www.pymol.org).
Trypsin digestion of GlnH. For trypsin digestion of GlnH, 8 �g of GlnH in 10 �l phosphate-buffered
saline was incubated overnight with 4 or 8 �g trypsin at 20°
C with 0 or 1 mM Asp.
Accession numbers. Coordinates and structure factors were deposited in the Protein Data Bank with
accession codes 6H1U (GlnH with Asp), 6H20 (GlnH with Asn), and 6H2T (GlnH with Glu).
