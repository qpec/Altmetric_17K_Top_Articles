Abstract
Background: Little is known about the long-term health effects of ambient ultrafine particles (<0.1 μm) (UFPs)
including their association with respiratory disease incidence. In this study, we examined the relationship between
long-term exposure to ambient UFPs and the incidence of lung cancer, adult-onset asthma, and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD).
Methods: Our study cohort included approximately 1.1 million adults who resided in Toronto, Canada and who
were followed for disease incidence between 1996 and 2012. UFP exposures were assigned to residential locations
using a land use regression model. Random-effect Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard
ratios (HRs) describing the association between ambient UFPs and respiratory disease incidence adjusting for
ambient fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5), NO2, and other individual/neighbourhood-level covariates.
Results: In total, 74,543 incident cases of COPD, 87,141 cases of asthma, and 12,908 cases of lung cancer were
observed during follow-up period. In single pollutant models, each interquartile increase in ambient UFPs was
associated with incident COPD (HR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.09) but not asthma (HR = 1.00, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.01) or lung
cancer (HR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.03). Additional adjustment for NO2 attenuated the association between UFPs and
COPD and the HR was no longer elevated (HR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.03). PM2.5 and NO2 were each associated with
increased incidence of all three outcomes but risk estimates for lung cancer were sensitive to indirect adjustment
for smoking and body mass index.
Conclusions: In general, we did not observe clear evidence of positive associations between long-term exposure
to ambient UFPs and respiratory disease incidence independent of other air pollutants. Further replication is
required as few studies have evaluated these relationships.

Background
Short-term
exposures
to
ambient
ultrafine
particles
(UFPs) (<0.1 μm) have been associated with acute changes
in physiological measures of cardiorespiratory health [1, 2]
but little is known about the long-term health effects of
these pollutants. Recently, Ostro et al. [3] applied a chem-
ical transport model to estimate UFP exposures (on a
3 × 3 km scale) for women in the California Teachers
Study cohort and reported a positive association between
ambient UFPs and ischemic heart disease mortality. More-
over, various sources/components of ambient UFPs were
independently associated with ischemic heart disease mor-
tality including elemental/organic carbon, metals (copper
and iron), and emissions from gasoline and diesel engines
[3]. Ambient UFPs were not associated with all-cause
mortality or respiratory mortality (including lung cancer).
To our knowledge, this is the only cohort study to date to
evaluate the long-term health effects of ambient UFPs and

 studies have yet to evaluate the relationship between UFPs
and the incidence of respiratory diseases.
In this study, we examined the association between
long-term exposure to ambient UFPs and the incidence of
lung cancer, adult-onset asthma, and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) in Toronto, Canada. Long-
term ambient UFP exposures were assigned to the resi-
dential locations of cohort members using a land use re-
gression model developed for Toronto [4]. Our primary
aim in conducting this study was to determine if ambient
UFPs are independently associated with respiratory dis-
ease incidence after adjusting for other air pollutants in-
cluding fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) and nitrogen
dioxide (NO2).
Methods
Study population
Our study was conducted using the Ontario Population
Health and Environment Cohort (ONPHEC), a large
population-based cohort in Ontario Canada. Details of
the ONPHEC cohort are provided elsewhere [5]. Briefly,
this cohort is comprised of all adults in Ontario who, on
April 1, 1996 and onwards, were registered with Ontar-
io’s provincial health insurance plan, resided in Ontario
for ≥5 years, and were Canadian-born. The cohort was
created through record linkages of population-based
health administrative databases developed from the On-
tario universal healthcare system.
Our analysis included all cohort members who, on April
1, 1996, resided in the city of Toronto, were aged between
30 and 100 years, and were free of the conditions under
investigation.
Cohort
members
were
followed
until
December 31, 2012 to determine incident cases of asthma
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). For
lung cancer, follow-up began on April 1, 2001 to allow for
a minimum 5-year time lag in exposure.
Outcomes
All health data (including comorbidity data for diabetes,
congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, acute myo-
cardial infarction (AMI) and all cancers) were obtained
from databases housed at the Institute for Clinical and
Evaluative Sciences (ICES). This study used the following
databases: 1) Registered Persons Database (for age, sex,
residential history and health insurance eligibility); 2) On-
tario COPD Database (for incident COPD); 3) Ontario
Asthma Surveillance Information System (for incident
asthma); 4) Ontario Cancer Registry (for incident lung
cancer); 5) Census at the dissemination area level (for in-
come quintile, census tract-level unemployment rate, edu-
cation and mean household income); and 6) National
Population Health Survey and Canadian Community
Health Survey (for smoking habits and BMI used in the
indirect adjustment). The International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes for COPD and
asthma and the third edition of the International Classifi-
cation of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-3) codes for lung
cancer are presented in Table 1.
Air pollution exposure
Estimates of long-term average exposure to ambient
UFP and NO2 were derived from land use regression
models developed for the city of Toronto [4, 6]. UFP ex-
posure estimates were based on measurements collected
in 2014 [4, 7] while NO2 exposure estimates were based
on measurements collected in 2004 [6]. Briefly, the UFP
model was based on data collected from a mobile moni-
toring campaign conducted over three weeks (2 weeks in
summer, 1 week in winter) including data from 405 road
segments distributed across the city of Toronto. Recent
evidence from Amsterdam suggests that short-term
monitoring campaigns can be used to develop models to
predict past spatial variations in ambient UFPs [8]. The
UFP model used in this study included parameters for
the natural logarithm of the distance to highways, major
roads, the central business district, Pearson international
airport, and bus routes as well as land use variables for
park land (100-m buffer), open space (100-m buffer),
on-street trees (100-m buffer), and length of bus routes
(100-m buffer). The model R2 value was 0.67; when eval-
uated on an external sample of 151 data points the R2
value was 0.50 and the mean difference between mea-
sured and predicted values was −1385 particles/cm3
(95% CI: -3754, 982) [4].
The NO2 model was based on data collected from 94
sites across Toronto and included variables for the
lengths of expressways (200-m buffer) and major roads
(50-m buffer), industrial land use (750-m buffer), density
of dwellings (2000-m buffer), 24-h traffic counts (500-m
buffer), and being downwind of an expressway within
1500 m. The model R2 value for the NO2 model was

 0.69 and bias was estimated to be less than 4% in cross-
validation procedures (a cross-validation R2 was not re-
ported) [6]. Estimates of long-term average PM2.5 concen-
trations
(1998–2011)
were
derived
from
satellite
observations at a spatial resolution of approximately
1 km × 1 km as previously described [9]. These estimates
have been shown to agree closely with ground-level moni-
toring data across North America (R2 = 0.82) [9].
Three-year moving average exposures (based on place
of residence) were used for the main analyses.
Covariates
Individual level covariate data are limited in the ONPHEC
cohort. We compiled the following covariates at baseline:
age, sex and five comorbidities including diabetes, CHF,
hypertension, AMI and all cancers (ICD-9 codes in Table 1).
We further created four neighbourhood-level variables
using 1996, 2001, and 2006 Canadian Census Dissemin-
ation data: 1) the proportion of recent immigrants; 2) the
proportion of population aged ≥15 years who had not
completed high school; 3) unemployment rate; and 4)
mean household income.
Statistical methods
We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) using Cox propor-
tional hazards models stratified by sex and one-year age
groups. Continuous measures of long-term exposures to
UFPs, PM2.5 and NO2 were included in the models as
time-dependent variables using a 3-year moving average.
For the incidence of lung cancer, a 5-year time lag in the
exposure was used (i.e. the most recent 5-years were ex-
cluded from the moving average exposure). Follow-up
ended if participants died, became ineligible for provin-
cial health insurance (i.e. movement out of province),
moved outside of Toronto, or at the end of follow-up
(December 31, 2012).
For all three outcomes, we incrementally adjusted for
a
series
of
covariates
including
comorbidities
and
neighbourhood-level contextual variables. We also eval-
uated the impact of including a frailty term for neigh-
bourhood (n = 140 in the city of Toronto) to account
for any unmeasured confounding factors at the neigh-
bourhood level that may be associated with both expos-
ure and outcomes. Finally, we examined multi-pollutant
models including UFPs, NO2 and PM2.5 and investigated
potential effect modification by age and sex. In addition,
we conducted stratified analyses to evaluate potential ef-
fect modification by NO2 in associations between par-
ticulate air pollutants and respiratory outcomes. All HRs
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) reflect interquartile
range (IQR) increases in air pollution concentrations.
A series of sensitivity analyses were conducted to test
the robustness of our results. Specifically, UFP concen-
trations (our primary exposure of interested) were
additionally modelled across quintiles of exposure. In
addition, we considered mean annual exposures for each
pollutant over other time windows including one and
two year moving averages; we restricted analyses to par-
ticipants who had lived at their baseline address for
more than 5 years prior to cohort entry; we adjusted for
a linear term for time to account for potential changes
in the risk of outcomes of interest over time; we adjusted
for distance to major roadways; and we indirectly ad-
justed for potential confounding by smoking and BMI
[10]. For lung cancer, we also tested the sensitivity of the
results by repeating the analyses after taking into ac-
count 0-year (no time lag) and 2-year lags in the expos-
ure estimates. Finally, models for asthma and COPD
were additional adjusted for prevalent lung cancer as a
surrogate measure of smoking.
Indirect adjustment analyses (to estimate the associ-
ation between air pollution exposures and adjustment
variables for smoking and BMI) made use of data on
3807 subjects in the city of Toronto from the Canadian
Community Health Survey from the 2001, 2003, 2005
and 2007 panels who were between 30 and 100 years of
age [10]. The hazard ratios between adjustment variables
and respiratory disease incidence were directly calculated
from the CCHS data because recent systematic reviews of
the associations between our selected incidence outcomes
and missing risk factors (i.e. smoking and BMI) were not
identified. However, we did compare hazard ratios calcu-
lated using the CCHS respondents with those reported in
previous studies, and found similar results. Specifically,
lung cancer incidence was substantially higher in current
(HR = 13.67, 95% CI: 3.46–54.03) and former smokers
(HR = 4.18, 95% CI 1.15–15.23) in the CCHS respondents
compared to never smokers. Similarly, the Women’s
Health Initiative Observational Study (WHI-OS) in the
US reported that HRs for lung cancer incidence were
13.44 (95% CI: 10.80–16.75) and 4.20 (95% CI: 3.48–5.08)
in current and formers smokers, respectively, relative to
never smokers [11]. The population characteristics of the
CCHS cohort used for indirect adjustment were also simi-
lar to our study populations (i.e. 45% male, mean age of
58 years, and hypertension prevalence of 18.2%).
Details of the indirect adjustment procedure have been
describe previously [12]. Briefly, motivated by the theory
of partitioned regression for linear regression models,
this method allows for adjusting the HRs for these risk
factors unavailable in the dataset, while simultaneously
controlling for all risk factors included in the Cox
models (e.g., comorbidities and neighborhood-level co-
variates). The method requires estimates of the spatial
associations between the variables included in the Cox
models and the unobserved variables. These estimated
relationships were then used to indirectly adjust for
smoking (never, former, or current cigarette smoker) and

 BMI (<25.0, 25.0–29.9, or ≥30 kg/m2) for the entire co-
hort (see Additional file 1: Table S1). The Delta values
reported in Table S1 refer to estimated associations be-
tween the omitted variables (i.e. smoking and BMI) and
the concentrations of UFPs, PM2.5, and NO2. Negative
values indicate inverse relationships between the preva-
lence of the omitted variables and levels of pollution.
Results
In total, 74,543 incident cases of COPD (mean follow-up
14.4 years), 87,141 cases of adult-onset asthma (mean
follow-up 14.0 years), and 12,908 cases of lung cancer
(mean follow-up 14.6 years) were identified over the
follow-up period (Table 2). Men and women were
present in our cohort in approximately equal propor-
tions and participants had a mean age of approximately
50 years at baseline (Table 2). Approximately 22% of
each baseline cohort population moved outside the city
of Toronto during the follow-up period. UFP exposures
varied substantially across Toronto ranging from less
than 10,000/cm3 to more than 100,000/cm3 (Table 3).
Spatial variations in ambient PM2.5 and NO2 concentra-
tions were less dramatic but still covered the range of
exposures typically observed across Canada (Table 3).
Estimated UFP exposures were weakly correlated with
PM2.5 (r = −0.26) and NO2 (r = 0.23); PM2.5 and NO2
were also weakly correlated (r = 0.22). These correla-
tions are consistent with those previously observed in a
panel study of personal air pollution exposures in
Canada [13]. A scatter plot of NO2 and UFP concentra-
tions is provided in Additional file 1: Figure S1.
Hazard ratios describing the associations between am-
bient air pollutants and respiratory disease incidence are
shown in Table 4. UFP exposures were not associated
with increased lung cancer incidence. Small positive as-
sociations were observed between UFPs and asthma and
COPD in single pollutant models but the magnitudes of
these associations decreased when other air pollutants
were included in the models (Fig. 1). The relationship
between UFPs and COPD was also sensitive (and
change directions) to the inclusion of a frailty term for
neighbourhood suggesting an important impact of un-
measured confounding factors. When UFP exposures
were modelled categorically across quintiles, COPD
and asthma incidence were each increased in the four
upper quintiles compared to the lowest category of

 exposure; these risk estimates decreased (but remained
elevated) when PM2.5 and NO2 were included in the
models(Table 5).
Ambient PM2.5 and NO2 were each associated with
modest increases (i.e. 1–12% in fully adjusted models) in
the incidence of all three respiratory outcomes and asso-
ciations were robust to adjustment for medial comorbid-
ities, neighbourhood level covariates, and other air
pollutants. However, including a frailty term in models
for PM2.5 (COPD and lung cancer models) and NO2
(COPD model) also impacted risk estimates with hazard
ratios increasing for NO2 and decreasing for PM2.5.
For UFPs and NO2, associations with incident COPD
were strongest among younger subjects; however, other
observed associations did not differ substantially by age
or sex (Table 6). There was no clear evidence of effect
modification by NO2 in stratified analyses of associations
between particulate air pollutants and respiratory out-
comes (Additional file 1: Table S2). Additional adjust-
ment of asthma and COD models for prevalent lung
cancer did not materially change results for any of the
pollutants (data not shown).
Sensitivity analyses for PM2.5 and NO2 are shown in
Tables 7 and 8. The hazard ratios for PM2.5, NO2, and
lung cancer were sensitive to indirect adjustment for
smoking and BMI and the magnitudes of these associa-
tions decreased when these parameters were included in
the model. The magnitudes of associations between
PM2.5 and NO2 and COPD/asthma were robust (i.e.
changes of 1–2%) to various modeling approaches
including indirect adjustment for smoking and obesity
(Tables 7-8). Hazard ratios for UFPs and lung cancer

Discussion
A number of studies have observed short-term cardio-
vascular and respiratory health effects of ambient UFPs
[1, 2] but little is known about the long-term health ef-
fects
of
these
pollutants.
We
conducted
a
large
population-based study to examine the relationship be-
tween long-term exposure to ambient UFPs and respira-
tory disease incidence in Toronto, Canada. In general,
we did not observe clear evidence of positive associa-
tions between UFPs and respiratory disease incidence in-
dependent of other air pollutants although positive
associations were observed between UFPs and incident
COPD.
To our knowledge, only one previous cohort study has
evaluated the long-term health effects of ambient UFPs.
Specifically, Ostro et al. [3] reported positive associations
between UFP concentrations (and various components)
and ischemic heart disease mortality but UFPs were not
associated with mortality from respiratory outcomes. Our
findings are consistent with this result as we did not ob-
serve clear evidence of associations between ambient
UFPs and any of the respiratory outcomes examined. On
the other hand, spatial variations in long-term average am-
bient NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations were positively asso-
ciated with lung cancer incidence and this is consistent
with existing evidence related to outdoor air pollution and
lung cancer risk [14, 15]; however, these associations were
sensitive to indirect adjustment for smoking and BMI in
our analyses.
In general, it is not clear why UFPs would not be asso-
ciated with lung cancer incidence as diesel exhaust is a
known carcinogen [16] and diesel vehicles are an im-
portant source of UFPs in urban areas [7, 17]. One ex-
planation
may
be
that
the
rapid
condensation/
agglomeration of UFPs into larger particles tends to con-
centrate carcinogenic substances into larger particle size
fractions and this hypothesis is supported by previous
associations between PM2.5 and lung cancer [14]. Alter-
natively, residential estimates of long-term average UFP
concentrations may not adequately capture long-term
personal exposures as other micro-environments (such
as transportation) [7] likely also contribute substantially
to UFP exposures. In the future, it may be interesting to
incorporate mobility information (e.g. both home and
workplace location) into exposure assessment in large
population-based studies to see if this has an important

 impact on effect estimates for pollutants with high
spatial variability.
A previous review of epidemiological studies related to
air pollution and adult-onset asthma found inconsistent
evidence in support of a causal relationship and identi-
fied the need for large-scale cohort studies and the
inclusion of local-scale traffic pollutants like UFPs [18].
Our investigation addressed both of these needs and our
results indicate that NO2 and PM2.5 may each contribute
to increases in the incidence of adult-onset asthma inde-
pendent of other potential risk factors. The results of
two other large cohort studies also support these

 findings. Specifically, Young et al. [19] reported positive
associations
between
incident
adult-onset
asthma/
wheeze and ambient PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations
among approximately 50,000 women followed over a 4-
year period as part of the United States Sister Study co-
hort. Moreover, a combined analysis of six European co-
horts including approximately 24,000 subjects reported
positive associations between ambient PM2.5/NO2 and
the development of adult onset asthma [20]. Collectively,
evidence from these recent large prospective cohort
studies suggests that ambient air pollutants including
NO2 and PM2.5 may contribute to a modest increase in
the incidence of adult-onset asthma.
Epidemiological evidence related long-term air pollu-
tion exposures and COPD incidence is somewhat limited
and remains inconclusive [21]. In particular, two recent
cohort studies found little evidence of important rela-
tionships between PM2.5, NO2, and COPD incidence.
Specifically, Gan et al. [22] reported weak associations
between PM2.5, NO2, and COPD hospitalizations/mor-
tality in a cohort of approximately 500,000 subjects in
Vancouver, Canada followed over a 4-year period. Simi-
larly, a large national cohort study in England including
more than 800,000 subjects found little evidence of an
important association between PM2.5, NO2 and COPD
incidence [23]. Conversely, Andersen et al. [24] reported
a positive association between long-term exposure to
NO2 and incident COPD in a Danish cohort study of ap-
proximately 57,000 subjects followed between 1993 and
2006. While our findings support modest association be-
tween PM2.5, NO2 and COPD incidence (and possibly
UFPs), collective evidence remains limited.
This study had a number of important advantages includ-
ing large numbers of incident cases and detailed exposure
information for multiple air pollutants accounting for sub-
ject mobility; however, it is important to note several limita-
tions. First, it is difficult to compare the magnitude of
associations across pollutants as different exposure models
were used for each air pollutant. Therefore, differences in
exposure measurement error might have resulted in more/
less bias in associations for a given air pollutant depending
on the degree to which residential exposure estimates
(assigned to postal code centroids) reflected true long-term
personal exposures. This measurement error likely contains
components of both Classical (i.e. estimated ambient con-
centrations distribute around true ambient concentrations)
and Berkson type measurement error (true personal expo-
sures distributed around estimated mean ambient concen-
trations). As this error is likely non-differential with respect
to survival time, the Classical measurement error compo-
nent would tend to bias risk estimates toward the null in
proportion to the correlation between measured exposures
and true long-term personal exposures (which is unknown
and is not provided by the model evaluation R2 values). The
Berkson component of measurement error would not bias
risk estimates but would decrease the precision of risk esti-
mates. Therefore, the hazard ratios presented in this study
likely underestimate the true magnitudes of associations be-
tween long-term exposure to air pollution and respiratory
disease incidence.
For UFPs, the exposure model was based on spatial
monitoring data collected after the follow-up period and
this may have contributed to the null associations ob-
served in our analyses. While analysis of long-term
trends would help to clarify this question, the data re-
quired to support such an analysis do not exist. More-
over, UFPs are only weakly correlated with ambient NO2
and PM2.5 and thus trends in these pollutants cannot be
used to infer trends in UFPs. What seems likely is that
our model may underestimate true long-term exposure
levels owing to decreases in vehicle emissions over time.
However, spatial differences in UFP concentrations are
likely more stable over time because spatial differences
are primarily impacted by changes in the spatial patterns
of diesel traffic (primarily large diesel vehicles). Since
large diesel vehicles remain concentrated on major road-
ways, contrasts between high-traffic and low-traffic areas
are likely preserved over time. Therefore, our model
likely provides useful estimates of the relationship be-
tween health outcomes and changes in UFP exposure
but may not be appropriate for determining absolute
concentrations at which health effects occur (i.e. some
minimum exposure threshold).
Another limitation is that we did not have individual
level data on smoking behavior which is an important
risk factor for all of the outcomes examined. To address
this limitation, we used an indirect method of con-
founder adjustment based on pollutant-outcome associa-
tions in a second cohort available in the Toronto area
and observed important changes in our effect estimates
when this method was applied. However, we cannot rule
out residual confounding by smoking.
Conclusions
We did not observe clear evidence of positive associations
between long-term exposure to ambient UFPs and the in-
cidence of lung cancer, COPD, or adult onset asthma. Our
findings do suggest a possible association between UFPs
and COPD but this association was sensitive to other air
pollutants. In general, our findings require further replica-
tion in future cohort analyses as few studies have exam-
ined the chronic health effects of ambient UFPs to date.
