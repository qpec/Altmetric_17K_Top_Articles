In developing youth, allergic asthma is the most common chronic condition, with
9%–10% of youth affected. Asthma onset during childhood and adolescence is further
associated with other health issues, particularly psychiatric conditions. To understand
causal mechanisms by which developmental asthma may lead to altered behavior,
brain and health trajectories, we developed a mouse model of developmental allergic
asthma. In the current study, we tested for potential long-term effects of developmental
asthma on adult lung function and behavior and brain gene expression associated
with emotion and stress regulation. We manipulated airway inflammation (AI) and
methacholine (MCH)-induced bronchospasm (resulting in labored breathing, LB) in
young male and female BALB/cJ mice and measured adult outcomes 3 months after
final asthma manipulations. Results indicated that allergen exposure, used to cause AI,
and which ended on post-natal day 56 (P56), led to persistent lung AI, mucus buildup
and gene expression related to allergic asthma 3 months after final allergen exposure. In
addition, at this same age, early allergen exposure led to altered brain gene expression
related to stress regulation (prefrontal corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1,
Crhr1 and hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor, GR) and serotonin function (brainstem
serotonin transporter, SERT). On the other hand, LB events during development led to
altered anxiety-related behavior. Importantly, sex and pre-asthma fear-related behavior
(ultrasonic vocalization, USV rates) modulated these adult outcomes. Asthma that
develops during childhood/adolescence may have long-term impacts on emotion and
stress regulation mechanisms, and these influences may be moderated by sex and
pre-asthma temperament.

Long-Term Effects of Peri-adolescent Asthma
INTRODUCTION
Allergic asthma affects 9.5% of children and adolescents in the
United States (Akinbami et al., 2012). People with asthma can
develop comorbidities with other atopic disorders and other
health outcomes (Guerra et al., 2004; Lødrup Carlsen et al.,
2014). Importantly, there is a high comorbidity of allergic
and internalizing disorders such as anxiety and depression,
conditions that are associated with altered stress and immune
regulation (Nascimento et al., 2002; Goodwin et al., 2003; Katon
et al., 2007; Ross et al., 2007; Buske-Kirschbaum et al., 2008;
Tonelli et al., 2009). Interestingly, research suggests that asthma
patients are at greater risk for developing these internalizing
disorders as early as adolescence (Dudeney et al., 2017).
Serotonin function, in particular transporter function, has
been implicated in the pathology of internalizing disorders.
For example, serotonin transporter (SERT) knockout mice
display anxiety-like behavior, and in patients with depression,
negative attitudes are correlated with SERT binding potential
(Holmes et al., 2003; Meyer, 2007). Interestingly, serotonin
also plays a role in allergic responses—its release in the
periphery is part of the T-helper type 2 allergic response, and
manipulation of peripheral receptors results in improvement
of asthma symptoms in murine models (Nau et al., 2015;
Shajib and Khan, 2015). In addition, mast cells, which are
found in the skin and mucosal tissues as well as in the
central nervous system, play an important role in allergic
responses and produce molecules like histamine during reactions
(Theoharides et al., 2012; Dong et al., 2014). Mast cells are
also responsible for producing 20%–40% of the serotonin in
the hippocampus, and they produce serotonin in cases of
non-allergic asthma and after injury (Nautiyal et al., 2012;
Theoharides et al., 2012; Shajib and Khan, 2015). Thus,
one mechanism by which allergic asthma may predispose an
individual toward internalizing disorders may be by altered
serotonin regulation.
Adolescence is an important time for maturation and growth:
many changes occur in the body and brain that are critical
for normal development of emotion and stress regulation as
well as behavior (Spear, 2000; Tirelli et al., 2003; Dahl, 2004;
Romeo, 2010, 2015; Sachser et al., 2011; McCormick and Green,
2013). Chronic stressors during this period of growth can
have a negative impact on normal development and lead to
increased risk of anxiety- or depression-related internalizing
disorders (Spear, 2000; Molnar et al., 2001; Barnum et al.,
2012; Moretti and Craig, 2013; Dudeney et al., 2017). These
adolescent stress effects can also exacerbate adult allergen-
induced immune responses and lung hyper-responsiveness, and
they can increase midbrain tumor necrosis factor alpha and
interleukin (IL)-1 levels following a later immune challenge
(Chida et al., 2007; Barnum et al., 2012). The downstream
consequences of adolescent stress can be relatively long lasting.
For example, chronic adolescent social and non-social stress
in male rats and mice can result in anxiety-like effects from
3 weeks to 28 weeks after the end of stress (McCormick et al.,
2008; Chaby et al., 2015; Caruso et al., 2017). Chronic adolescent
stress can also cause lasting changes in rat hippocampal soma
volume 3 weeks after stress completion (Isgor et al., 2004). Thus,
adolescence may be a period when organisms are particularly
susceptible to long-term effects of stressors, although it is
important to note that adolescence may also be a period
of stress resilience (Meyer et al., 2016; Sadler and Bailey,
2016).
While evidence suggests that stressors during adolescence
predispose an organism toward adult anxiety, it is possible that
a predisposition to anxiety prior to adolescence may heighten
individual responses to and/or memory of adolescent stressors.
In the case of adolescent asthma, an anxious predisposition
may exacerbate inflammatory symptoms, resulting in more
severe or persistent asthma, and/or more frequent recollection
of these symptoms (Richardson et al., 2006). Research indicates
that anxiety can be brought on from experiencing a chronic
health challenge and associated adverse medical events (Chida
et al., 2008). Additionally, parental anxiety can influence
a child, putting them at increased risk for developing an
anxiety disorder (Whaley et al., 1999). This bi-directional
relationship
between
asthma
and
internalizing
disorders
requires further study to elucidate causal directionality and
mechanism.
With regard to asthma-internalizing disorder co-morbidity,
there are important sex differences to consider. Young males
tend to have a higher prevalence of asthma compared to
females, but this ratio changes in adolescence and adulthood
such that females have higher rates of asthma than males
at these older ages (Anderson et al., 1992; Skobeloff et al.,
1992; Katon et al., 2007). Other disorders also show distinct
sex-specific diagnosis and prevalence patterns. Males tend
to show increased rates of behavioral and developmental
disorders like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder compared
to females, whereas females tend to exhibit higher rates
of anxiety, depression and other mood disorders (Andersen
and Teicher, 2000; Abikoff et al., 2002; Roza et al., 2003;
Holder and Blaustein, 2014). Among adolescents with asthma,
females are at greater risk for being diagnosed with anxiety
disorders compared to males (Katon et al., 2007; Ross
et al., 2007). The effects of adolescent stress can also be
worse in females compared to males (Bourke and Neigh,
2011).
In this manuscript, we focus on two features of allergic asthma
that may be important in influencing anxiety development.
Airway inflammation (AI) is a classic feature of allergic disorders,
including asthma, characterized by enhanced T-helper type
2 immune reaction. Allergen-activated T-helper type 2 cells
and IL-33 stimulated Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2)
produce cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 to promote
the allergic response and inflammation (Galli et al., 2008;
Lloyd, 2010; Salmond et al., 2012; Sjöberg et al., 2017). Certain
polymorphisms of IL-33 have also been correlated with increased
risk of developing hay fever earlier than 6 years of age (Schröder
et al., 2016). Additionally, asthma is characterized by bouts
of respiratory dysfunction, bronchoconstriction and labored
breathing (LB), which can occur during acute asthma attacks.
This state of difficulty breathing that is often associated with
decreased oxygen saturation is a significant stressor, and it

Long-Term Effects of Peri-adolescent Asthma
has been associated with respiratory failure, changes in muscle
activity, and remodeling of the airways (Smith and Hudgel, 1980;
Ahmad et al., 2012). Both chronic AI and repeated acute LB
experiences during development may alter brain and behavior
development in such a way as to predispose an individual toward
internalizing disorders.
Recent work has established a mouse model of peri-adolescent
asthma using independent manipulation of AI and LB to
determine how these developmental symptoms affect later-life
behavior and physiology. This prior work showed that chronic
exposure to intranasal allergen that began during the first week
of life led to significant AI, inflammatory cytokine expression,
mucus production and collagen buildup in the lungs within
2–4 weeks, and inhaled methacholine (MCH) treatments during
development led to significant acute LB events (Saglani et al.,
2009; Caulfield et al., 2017). In addition, in adulthood, 3 weeks
after termination of repeated peri-adolescent acute LB events,
mice exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior and altered
brain gene expression (Caulfield et al., 2017). In addition,
lung inflammation persisted 3 weeks after cessation of chronic
allergen exposure during development, and inflammation and
airway hyper-responsiveness was more pronounced in females
than males (Blacquière et al., 2010; Caulfield et al., 2017). A
longitudinal study on humans with asthma determined that
childhood asthma severity (at 7 years of age) strongly predicted
lung function and persistence of symptoms in adulthood (at
50 years of age; Tai et al., 2014a). In the current study, we
manipulated the same characteristics of allergic asthma (AI
and LB) to determine behavioral and physiological effects of
these peri-adolescent asthma symptoms 3 months after exposure
ended. We used our previously-established mouse model and
measured behavior, AI/mucus and brain/lung gene expression
3 months after allergen exposure ended (Caulfield et al., 2017).
To determine if long-term effects of developmental asthma were
specific to a certain sex or moderated by pre-asthma fearful
disposition, we studied both males and females and quantified
neonate fear-associated behavior (ultrasonic vocalization, USV)
prior to experimental asthma induction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental Groups and Design
The goal of the present study was to determine what changes
persist in mouse adult anxiety-related behavior, gene expression,
and corticosterone production 3 months after peri-adolescent
asthma symptom exposure. The study used male and female
BALB/cJ mice in four peri-adolescent asthma conditions: (1) AI;
(2) LB; (3) AI+LB; and (4) Similarly-Handled Controls—CON
(Figure 1A). Animals were bred in three cohorts to reach
a minimum of 10 animals per sex per condition (N = 98,
23–41 mice/cohort). To control for litter effects, same-sex pups
from each litter were evenly distributed across all conditions,
and all experimental manipulations and data collection were
conducted for all littermates at the same time. Body weights
were measured on P14, 90 and 140 to determine if the above
manipulations altered growth trajectories. By P90, males weighed
significantly more than females (P90: F(1,82) = 125.7, p < 0.001;
P140: F(1,81) = 411.6, p < 0.001), but there were no significant
effects of AI, LB, or neonatal USV rates on weight at any age
(Fs < 2.65, ps > 0.108). This study was carried out in accordance
with the recommendations of the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals, Institute for Laboratory Animal Research.
The protocol was approved by the Pennsylvania State University
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Mouse Breeding and Housing
Male and female BALB/cJ breeders were obtained from Jackson
Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA), and mice were bred
in the laboratory. To produce litters of sufficient size, sister-
pairs were bred with one male to produce ‘‘double-litters’’
(24 double-litters, mean size: 6.5, not culled). Pup identity
was tracked by marking them with non-toxic Sharpie� marker
until postnatal day (P) 9, at which point all pups were given
permanent, unique ear notches. To quantify pre-manipulation
fear-related behavior, USVs were measured and coded on P3-P5
(2 min/day) using the ‘‘Isolation’’ method and recording at
65 Hz (Dichter et al., 1996; Brunelli et al., 1997; Branchi et al.,
1998; Hahn and Lavooy, 2005; Caulfield et al., 2017). Several
inbred strains of mice, including BALB/cJ mice, display peak
USV production at postnatal day P3 with USVs in the range
of 60–80 kHz, and the amount of calling decreases during
the first 2 weeks of life (Bell et al., 1972). In rodents, USVs
can predict later-life emotion regulation; mice selectively bred
based on pup frequency of USVs develop into distinct high and
low-calling lines, and offspring of low-calling lines demonstrate
less anxiety-like behavior compared to the high-calling line
(Dichter et al., 1996; Brunelli et al., 1997). In the present
study, pups within each litter were characterized as either
high or low calling relative to their litter median, and high-
and low-calling pups were evenly distributed among treatment
conditions.
Pups were weaned from the dam at P22 and placed
into same-sex sibling groups (2–4 mice) in standard cages
(28 cm × 17 cm × 12 cm) with corn-cob bedding. Cages were
not individually ventilated, but rather had standard wire lid
covers with a filter top over the lid. Identical weekly husbandry
procedures were used for all groups. Mice remained in these
groups until P50, at which point they were single-housed
in standard cages, then returned to cages with their original
littermates on P60. On P110, mice were again single-housed for
behavior testing (P120–135) until sacrificed (P140; Figure 1C).
All mouse cages had a red polypropylene tube, which acted as
environmental enrichment and a familiar transport vehicle for
experimental manipulations (Roy et al., 2001). Throughout the
study, colony rooms were maintained at 21 ± 1◦C, at 30%–70%
humidity, and on a reverse 12:12 light:dark schedule (lights on
18:00 h, lights off 06:00 h). All animals had ad libitum access to
food and water throughout the study.

Experimental procedures for induction of allergic asthma
symptoms were conducted as previously detailed and are briefly
described below (Caulfield et al., 2017).

Long-Term Effects of Peri-adolescent Asthma
FIGURE 1 | Study Timeline. (A) There were four experimental groups in the study, and each group experienced a component of airway inflammation and labored
breathing. The first group (Control, CON) served as the control group and received the saline control treatment for both experimental conditions. The second group
(Airway Inflammation, AI) was exposed to chronic house dust mite (HDM) to induce inflammation and to the saline control for the labored breathing condition. The
third group (Labored Breathing, LB) received saline control for the airway inflammation treatment and methacholine (MCH) to induce labored breathing events. The
final group (Airway Inflammation + Labored Breathing, AI+LB) was exposed to both experimental conditions (HDM and MCH). (B) Birth was designated as postnatal
day (P) zero, and ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) were conducted from P3–5. AI exposures occurred three times per week from P7–56, and LB treatments occurred
once per week from P22–57. (C) Mice underwent numerous behavior tests including the elevated plus maze (EPM) on P120, Sucrose Preference Test (SPT) on
P126, Forced Swim Test (FST) on P129, Novel Object Task (NP) on P132 and Novel Social (NS) Partner Task on P135. Animals were sacrificed at P140 and samples
were collected.
Airway Inflammation (AI)
AI was induced by regularly exposing young mice intranasally to
an extract of the most common aeroallergen for humans—house
dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, HDM; Greer Labs,
NC, USA). The AI and AI+LB groups were exposed intranasally
to a solution of HDM three times per week, and the CON
and LB groups received saline on the same schedule using the
same technique (Figure 1B). From P7–15, mice received 10 µg
(10 µL of 1 mg/ml protein weight solution in saline) of HDM
at each exposure, and from P16–56, doses increased to 15 µg
HDM (15 µL) and were administered under brief isoflurane
anesthesia. This method leads to significant lung inflammation
within 2 weeks of first dosage, and elevated inflammation persists
throughout the exposure period and at least 3 weeks after

Long-Term Effects of Peri-adolescent Asthma
cessation of the HDM exposures (Saglani et al., 2009; Caulfield
et al., 2017).
Labored Breathing (LB)
LB was induced by exposure to inhaled methacholine (MCH;
Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), a muscarinic receptor agonist. From
P22–57 exposures occurred once per week (Figure 1B). Mice
were placed in a whole-body plethysmograph holding chamber
(7.5 cm diameter × 7 cm height; Data Sciences International,
New Brighton, MN, USA) and allowed to acclimate for 3 min
followed by baseline breathing recorded for 3 min. After
acclimation and baseline, LB mice were exposed to five increasing
doses of aerosolized MCH (0, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 ng/ml in
100 µl saline). AI+LB mice received a half-dose of MCH (0,
3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25 ng/ml in 100 µl saline) to arrive at LB
estimates comparable to LB mice. In prior work, we titrated
the best MCH doses for the LB and AI+LB groups to arrive at
similar level of LB in both groups. CON and AI mice experienced
the exact same procedures but received saline instead of
MCH. To verify and estimate extent of bronchoconstriction,
enhanced pause (Penh) was recorded (Hamelmann et al., 1997)
using FinePointe software. Behavior in the plethysmograph was
recorded throughout each session (active, sit still, hunch, LB,
drool, gape). If three Penh values were above 15 or if a mouse
was visibly distressed, the MCH administration procedure was
terminated early. We have previously demonstrated that this
procedure leads to significant LB events in both allergen-exposed
and -unexposed BALB/cJ mice (Caulfield et al., 2017).
Behavior Testing
Anxiety-Related Behavior, Elevated Plus Maze (EPM)
On P120, elevated plus maze (EPM) was conducted to measure
anxiety behavior. This test has been pharmacologically validated,
and it is a classic test for observing anxiety-related behavior in
mice (Pellow et al., 1985; Lister, 1987; Hogg, 1996; File, 2001;
Carobrez and Bertoglio, 2005). The maze consists of two open
(30 × 5 cm) and two closed (30 × 14.5 × 5) flat perpendicular
arms elevated 42 cm above the ground. Test orders were pseudo-
randomized to balance conditions and litter mates. Mice were
brought to the test room ∼1 h before testing, transported to the
maze in the familiar red tube, and placed in the maze facing an
open arm. Testing was completed under red light illumination
(<5 lux), and behavior video-recorded for 5 min. Entry into
a maze arm was defined as four limbs crossing the boundary
between sections. Videos were scored for: percent time spent on
open arms, total number of entries into open arms, and total
number of entries into open and closed arms. Percent time on
and entries into the open arms were used as inverse metrics of
anxiety-like behavior, and total arm entries were used to measure
overall locomotion.
Hedonic Behavior, Sucrose Preference Test (SPT)
On P126, free-choice consumption of sucrose was recorded in
the Sucrose Preference Test (SPT) to examine mouse hedonic
behavior (Strekalova et al., 2004). SPT is a reliable measure of
depression-related hedonic behavior (Porsolt et al., 1977). Mice
had 24-h free access to a bottle with tap water and another bottle
with a 3% sucrose solution. BALB/cJ mice show a preference for
sucrose solutions with a concentration of sugar that is higher
than other inbred mouse strains (Lewis et al., 2005). After 12 h,
bottle positions were switched to avoid side preference biases.
Prior to and following the 24-h period, each bottle was weighed
to calculate consumption of sucrose solution relative to water.
Decreased relative sucrose consumption was used as an index of
anhedonic behavior (McCormick and Green, 2013).
Depression-Related Behavior, Forced Swim Test
(FST)
Forced Swim Test (FST) was conducted on P129 to measure
depression-related behavior. Mice were individually tested by
placing them into a large beaker of water (25–27◦C) for 6 min.
Latency to become immobile, number of times immobile,
and total time immobile were quantified from video coding.
Immobility was defined as lack of movement in at least three
limbs. FST is a classic test for depressive behaviors, and higher
levels of immobility are indicators of this (McCormick and
Green, 2013).
Novelty Exploration, Novel Physical and Novel Social
Arenas
Exploratory behavior was measured on two separate arenas, one
containing novel mouse-sized objects and another containing
a novel social (NS) partner as previously described (Cavigelli
et al., 2007). Briefly, both arenas were 120 cm × 120 cm with
opaque walls and a Plexiglas cover. The floor was covered with
semi-soiled bedding. For the Novel Physical test, small objects
were placed in three of the four corners. For the NS test, a
same-age, same-sex mouse was placed in a wire container in one
corner, and a similar empty container was placed in the opposite
corner. For both tests, mice were run individually by carrying
them in a red enrichment tube from their home cage to the open
corner of the arena. Behavior was video-recorded using a camera
positioned well above the arena, and all testing was conducted in
low, red light (<10 lux). Latency to approach a novel object or
the NS partner were recorded in each arena; these behaviors are
associated with stress regulation (Cavigelli et al., 2007).

collagen thickness was quantified for each mouse based
on five thickness measures from each of 3–5 airways on
each of two lung slices per mouse as previously detailed
(Caulfield et al., 2017).
Adult Lung Cytokine Gene Expression
Lungs were collected at sacrifice and stored in RNAlater
(Ambion, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 24-h before freezing at
−80◦C. Tissue RNA extraction was conducted using TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA, USA) and Qiagen RNeasy
columns (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). RNA quantity and
quality were determined with a NanoDropTM spectrophotometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA) and Agilent
2100 BioAnalyzerTM (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA,
USA), respectively. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was reverse
transcribed from RNA with High-Capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcription kits (Applied Biosystems, Wilmington, DE, USA).
Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted to
measure relative abundance of the following genes in cDNA:
IL-4 (Mm00445259 m1), IL-5 (Mm00439646 m1). We also
conducted PCR to measure IL-13 expression (Mm00434204 m1),
but because of poor amplification, we do not report these
results here. Reactions were prepared in 96-well plates in
triplicate with validated TaqMan probes on a StepOnePlus
RT PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The following cycle
settings were implemented: 50◦C for 2 min, 95◦C for 10 min,
40 cycles of 95◦C for 15 s and 60◦C test for 60 s. Beta
actin (Actb) was used as the reference gene. Gene expression
scores were standardized to the median control mouse, and
relative gene abundance in each sample was determined with the
2−∆∆CT method as has been done previously (Caulfield et al.,
2017).
Adult Brain Serotonin- and HPA-Related Gene
Expression
Brains were freshly dissected at sacrifice, and the following brain
regions were collected: brainstem, hippocampus and prefrontal
cortex (PFC). All sections were collected, processed and analyzed
as described above for lung cytokine gene expression and as
described previously (Caulfield et al., 2017). The following
TaqMan Gene Expression Assay primers and probes were
used for PCR with brain tissue cDNA: SERT, serotonin
receptor 1a (5Htr1a), corticotropin releasing hormone receptor
1 (Crhr1) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR; Life Technologies,
Mm00439391 m1, Mm00434106 s1, Mm00432670 m1 and
Mm00433832 m1, respectively). The serotonin system is highly
implicated in anxiety and depression-related disorders (Holmes
et al., 2003), and this system is known to be affected in
models of allergy (Nau et al., 2015; Shajib and Khan, 2015).
Corticotropin releasing hormone and GRs are important aspects
of the stress response and anxiety-related behavior, and their
function can also become altered in response to developmental
stress (Contarino et al., 1999; Spear, 2000; McCormick and
Green, 2013).
Serum Corticosterone
To measure basal glucocorticoid levels, trunk blood was collected
immediately after sacrifice. Mean time required to sacrifice and
collect a blood sample after removal from the home cage was
4.3 min (SEM: 0.11). Samples were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for
15 min at 4◦C, and serum collected and stored at −80◦C until
analysis. Samples were analyzed in duplicate with a commercial
[125I] radioimmunoassay kit (MP Biomedicals, Solon OH, USA).
Intra-and inter-assay coefficients of variation for a low and high
control were 4.72 and 6.92 (for low control) and 5.51 and 6.88
(for high control). Time required for sample collection was
not related to serum corticosterone concentration (r = −0.125,
p = 0.182).
Statistical Analyses
To compare behavioral and physiological outcome variables
across
conditions,
ANCOVAs
were
conducted
with
AI
(intranasal saline vs. HDM exposure), LB (inhaled aerosolized
saline vs. MCH exposure), Sex (male vs. female) and USV
category (high vs. low) as factors. We used the cohort mean for
each outcome variable as a covariate to control for variation
between cohorts. Alpha was designated as 0.05. For all statistical
tests, variable distribution was examined to verify normal
distribution. The following variables were log transformed
to achieve a normal distribution for analyses: lung IL-4 and
IL-5 gene expression, brainstem SERT gene expression, serum
corticosterone, percent sucrose consumed in the SPT, percent
time spent on the open arms of the EPM, latency to immobility
in the FST, percent time immobile in the FST, latency to
approach an object in the Novel Physical task, and latency
to approach a social partner in the NS task. Outliers were
defined as ±2.5 SD and removed prior to statistical analyses.
Figures detail the untransformed estimated marginal means
for clarity. When there were no main or interaction effects
of Sex or USV category, we presented means in the figures
collapsed across these factors. Repeated measures ANOVAs
were used to determine if LB and/or Penh values changed during
repeat administrations from P22–57. Correlation analyses were
conducted to determine if there were any linear relationships
between gene expression (lung or brain), lung function measures
and behavioral outcomes.
RESULTS
Adult Physiology (P140)
Lung Cytokine Gene Expression
Three months after the final adolescent HDM and MCH
exposures, there was a significant main effect of Sex on IL-4 and
IL-5 expression—females had elevated levels compared to males
(IL-4: F(1,69) = 11.13, p < 0.001, Figure 2A; IL-5: F(1,68) = 158.23,
p < 0.001, Figure 2B). There were no other significant main
effects or interactions present for IL-4 (Fs < 3.62, ps > 0.061).
There was a main effect of AI on IL-5 expression—animals
treated with HDM had higher IL-5 expression than those not
treated with HDM (F(1,69) = 90.24, p < 0.001, Figure 2B). There
was also a main effect of LB, where MCH-treated mice had

less IL-5 expression compared to mice that were not exposed
to MCH (F(1,68) = 9.30, p < 0.01, Figure 2B). Finally, there
was a significant main effect of USV, where high-calling mice
had lower IL-5 expression than low-calling mice (F(1,68) = 4.41,
p < 0.05; data not shown in figure). No significant interactions
were noted for IL-5 (Fs < 2.02, ps > 0.160). We had poor
amplification for IL-13 and thus do not report results here.
Lung Mucus
There was a significant effect of AI on mucus levels; mice exposed
to chronic peri-adolescent HDM treatments had higher levels
of mucus in the lungs 3 months after final allergen treatments
(F(1,78) = 6.07, p < 0.05, Figure 2C,G). No other main effects or
interactions were significant (Fs < 3.63, ps > 0.060).
Lung Inflammation
Three months following completion of allergen exposure,
mice treated with HDM still had significant symptoms of
AI—i.e., greater average length and number of discrete areas of
inflammation—compared to non-HDM treated mice (AI main
effect on inflammation area length—F(1,78) = 82.76, p < 0.001;
and inflammation area number—F(1,78) = 100.70, p < 0.001,

Figures 2D,E,G). There was also a main effect of Sex and an
interaction of Sex and AI for measures of AI (Sex effect: average
length of inflammation area—F(1,78) = 16.03, p < 0.001, average
number of inflammation areas—F(1,78) = 20.93, p < 0.001,
Figures 2D,E; Sex × AI interaction: average number of
inflammation areas—F(1,78) = 4.43, p < 0.05). Females had
greater inflammation than males, and female-specific increased
inflammation was particularly pronounced in the HDM-treated
mice. There were no other significant main or interaction effects
for average inflammation area length or count (Fs < 3.86,
ps > 0.053; Fs < 2.04, ps > 0.157).
Lung Collagen
Mice that were exposed to developmental HDM had significantly
more collagen compared to mice that were not exposed to
HDM (F(1,71) = 4.12, p < 0.05; Figures 2F,G). There were no
other significant main or interaction effects for average collagen
thickness (Fs < 3.68, ps > 0.059).
Peri-adolescent Bronchoconstriction
(P22–57)
Compared to saline administration, MCH administration caused
significantly increased LB counts and Penh values throughout
development (LB: F(1,20) = 170.56, p < 0.001, Figure 3A;
Penh: F(1,20) = 130.28, p < 0.001, Figure 3B). LB and Penh
values increased with age (LB: F(5,350) = 3.66, p < 0.01; Penh:
F(1,100) = 3.15, p < 0.05), and mice treated with both HDM
and MCH (AI+LB) had greater increases in LB and Penh values
than mice treated with MCH alone (LB; AI × LB interaction:
LB—F(1,20) = 4.47, p < 0.05; Penh—F(1,20) = 15.32, p < 0.001;
Group means across all ages for LB: CON 0.00 ± 0.19, AI

0.48 ± 0.32, AI 0.63 ± 0.32, LB 1.34 ± 0.30, AI+LB 2.37 ± 0.30).
Adult Behavior
Elevated Plus Maze (P120)
There was a significant interaction of LB and USV on percent
time and number of entries in the open arms of the EPM.
For high-calling mice, MCH-exposure led to more time spent
and more entries in the open arms. For low-calling mice,
MCH-exposure led to less time spent and fewer entries into the
open arms relative to unexposed mice (LB × USV interaction:
percent time in open arms—F(1,80) = 8.05, p < 0.01; and number
of entries to open arms—F(1,80) = 4.97, p < 0.05, Figures 4A,B).
Additionally, there was a three-way interaction between AI, LB
and USV for time spent on the open arms, where the MCH
effect described above was dampened in mice exposed to both
HDM and MCH (F(1,80) = 5.01, p < 0.05, note final AI+LB bar
in Figure 4A). No other significant main or interaction effects
were observed for time spent or entries on open arms of EPM
(Fs < 2.79, ps > 0.099; Fs < 2.81, ps > 0.098). Time spent on the
open arms and number of entries on open arms were significantly
correlated (r = 0.782, p < 0.001). No significant main effects
or interactions were observed in total arm entries in the EPM
(Fs < 2.98, ps > 0.088; Figure 4C).
Latency to Approach Novelty (P132, P135)
In the novel object test (P132), there was a significant main
effect of Sex—males took longer to approach a novel object
compared to females (F(1,66) = 4.97, p < 0.05; Figure 4D).
There was also a significant three-way interaction between
AI, LB and USV (F(1,81) = 4.15, p < 0.05); HDM and
MCH independently decreased adult approach latencies for
high-calling mice and increased latency time in low-calling mice.
Both effects were negated by exposure to both HDM and MCH.
There were no other significant effects or interactions between
groups to approach a novel object (Fs < 1.32, ps > 0.255).
There were no significant main effects or interactions in
latency to approach a novel partner (P135; Fs < 2.29,
ps > 0.135).
Forced Swim Test (P129)
Adult mice that were exposed to HDM during development
became immobile faster in the FST compared to mice that were
not exposed (F(1,80) = 5.68, p < 0.05, Figure 4E). There were
no other main or interaction effects for latency to immobility
(Fs < 2.51, ps > 0.117). There were no significant main effects
or interactions for percent time spent immobile in the FST
(Fs < 2.64, ps > 0.108). There was a significant three-way
interaction between Sex, AI and USV for number of times
immobile (F(1,81) = 5.37, p < 0.05). HDM-exposure caused
high-calling males and low-calling females to increase the
number of immobility bouts in the FST compared to similar
calling males and females that were not exposed to HDM. No
other main effects or interactions were found for number of times
immobile (Fs < 2.77, ps > 0.100).
Sucrose Preference Test (P126)
Analysis of percent sucrose consumed in the SPT revealed
a significant interaction between Sex and USV; high-calling
female mice consumed less sucrose than low-calling females,
whereas high-calling males consumed more sucrose solution
than low-calling males (F(1,80) = 4.09, p < 0.05). No other
main effects or interactions were observed for percent sucrose
consumed (Fs < 2.54, ps > 0.115; Figure 4F).
Basal Corticoid Rhythm (P140)

had increased SERT expression only if they had received
both HDM and MCH (F(1,81) = 4.70, p < 0.05). There were
no other main or interaction effects on SERT expression
(Fs < 2.72, p > 0.103). Females had higher 5HTr1a expression

Correlations
Lung Measures
Many of the measures of lung inflammation and function
were significantly correlated with one another (correlation
statistics in Table 1). IL-5 expression was significantly and
positively correlated with average inflammation area length
(r = 0.694, p < 0.001), inflammation area count (r = 0.661,
p < 0.001) and mucus (r = 0.275, p = 0.011). Average
inflammation area length was strongly and positively correlated
with inflammation area count (r = 0.913, p < 0.001), and
mucus was positively correlated with inflammation area length
and count (r = 0.395, p < 0.001; r = 0.359, p < 0.001).
Collagen was positively correlated with inflammation patch
count (r = 0.211, p = 0.050), but it was not correlated with
average patch length (r = 0.188, p = 0.140), mucus (r = 0.188,
p = 0.082), or IL-5 gene expression in lungs (r = 0.112,
p = 0.333).
Lungs and Anxiety- and Depression-Related
Behavior
Some lung measures were significantly correlated with behavior
(Table 1). Percent time spent on the open arms of the EPM
was positively correlated with average inflammation area length
(r = 0.213, p < 0.05) and mucus (r = 0.324, p < 0.001),
and marginally related to inflammation area count (r = 0.187,
p = 0.071). Open arm entries on the EPM were positively
correlated with average inflammation area length (r = 0.212,
p < 0.05), inflammation area count (r = 0.220, p < 0.05), and
mucus (r = 0.232, p < 0.05). However, there were no significant
correlations between depression-related behavior (latency to
immobility on the FST) and the following lung measures: average
inflammation area length (r = −0.046, p = 0.661), number of
inflammation areas (r = −0.086, p = 0.408), mucus (r = −0.001,
p = 0.993) and lung IL-5 expression (r = 0.155, p = 0.157).
Brain Gene Expression and Anxiety-Related Behavior
A few correlations were found between brain gene expression
and anxiety-related behavior (Table 1). 5HTr1a gene expression
in PFC was significantly positively correlated with percent time
spent on the open arms of the EPM (r = 0.324, p < 0.01) and
number of open arm entries in the EPM (r = 0.234, p < 0.05).
It was also negatively correlated with mean USV calling rate
(r = −0.294, p < 0.01). On the other hand, 5HTr1a expression in
the hippocampus was not correlated with these same behavioral
measures (r = 0.108, p = 0.326; r = 0.095, p = 0.386; r = 0.163,
p = 0.100).
DISCUSSION
Long-Term Behavior and Brain Changes
Following Peri-adolescent Asthma
Results of the current study indicate that chronic inhaled
allergen exposure during development led to long-term changes
in lung function. Exposure to HDM extract three times
per week from neonatal age to late adolescence led to
increased AI, mucus, collagen and IL-5 gene expression
3 months after final allergen exposure, particularly in females.
In addition, developmental allergen exposure (and associated
lung alterations) altered gene expression for brainstem SERT
and PFC Crhr1, with these effects being sex- and USV-
specific. Females that had been exposed to allergen during
development showed increased brainstem SERT expression, and

low-calling females showed increased PFC Crhr1 expression,
compared to non-exposed females. Allergen-exposed males, on
the other hand, showed decreased brainstem SERT expression
and more modest increases in PFC Crhr1 expression compared
to unexposed males. These results, 3 months after final asthma
symptom induction, contrast with previously observed results
on short-term responses to developmental allergen exposure.
Specifically, in a prior study, we found that 3 weeks after
symptom induction was completed, there were no significant
effects of HDM exposure on similar adult anxiety- or depression-
related behaviors or similar brain gene expression related
to emotion and stress regulation. Rather, weekly exposure
to MCH to induce LB led to adult anxiety-related behavior
and brain gene expression in the short-term (Caulfield et al.,
2017). This disparity suggests that allergen exposure during
development, which causes immediate and significant AI,
mucus and collagen buildup, does not have immediate effects
on behavior and brain function, but rather, that long-term
allergic asthma symptoms that persist during development
and adulthood may eventually affect later behavior and brain
function.
While developmental allergen exposure caused several
changes in the above behavior and brain gene expression profiles,
the experimentally-induced, repeat, acute bronchoconstriction
events during development had fewer long-term effects on
behavior and brain gene expression. Exposure to inhaled
MCH once per week, which caused significant increases in
LB and Penh values at the time of exposure, only led to
one long-lasting effect on behavior and no long-lasting effects
on gene expression in the current study. The long-lasting
behavioral effect of peri-adolescent LB was increased anxiety-
related
behavior
on
the
EPM
for
mice
that
were
low
USV-callers (i.e., low fear) as neonates. In a prior study, we
found that developmental LB led to significant short-term
changes in anxiety-related behavior and brain gene expression;
specifically, developmental MCH exposure caused decreased
open arm time on the EPM, decreased brainstem SERT
expression, and increased hippocampal 5Htr1a and Crhr1
expression 3 weeks after final MCH exposure (Caulfield
et al., 2017). This difference in results between the current
and prior study suggest that repeat exposure to acute LB
events during development may lead to significant short-term
changes in anxiety-like behavior and brain gene expression,
and that these effects subside over time. Long-term anxiety-like
behavior may only persist in individuals that initially show
relatively low levels of fear. Overall, the results of the
current study suggest that the strongest long-term impacts
of developmental asthma on behavior and brain function
may depend on persistent effects to lung function that
result from chronic allergen exposure during development,
as opposed to long-term behavior/brain changes that result
from a discrete developmental period of allergic asthma
symptoms.
In the current study, we also documented significant effects
of sex and neonatal USV rates on adult lung and anxiety-related
outcomes. Females showed more signs of lung inflammation and
IL-4 and IL-5 expression than males—an effect that has been
previously documented (Blacquière et al., 2010; Caulfield et al.,
2017). Females also displayed greater exploration (i.e., faster
latency to approach a novel object) compared to males. Females

Long-Term Effects of Peri-adolescent Asthma
also had more 5HTr1a expression in the PFC compared to
males. It has been previously noted that females have higher
rates of anxiety- and mood-related disorders compared to males
(Roza et al., 2003; Ross et al., 2007; Holder and Blaustein,
2014). Some of these female-specific results of the present
study were also evident in adult mice that, as pups, had
displayed less fear-related USVs when isolated. Adult mice
that displayed low-calling USV rates as pups had increased
IL-5 expression in the lungs. Pup ultrasonic calling rates also
modulated some of the effects of developmental allergen and
LB on adult behavior. Regardless of sex, mice that experienced
weekly MCH exposures spent more time and made more
entries onto the open arms of the EPM if they were high
callers rather than low callers. Additionally, low-calling mice
approached a novel object faster than high-calling mice in
the Novel Physical test. USVs are vocal signals produced by
pups in various ethologically important circumstances including
isolation or separation from the nest, and they are important
in mother-pup communication in early life (Bell et al., 1972;
Branchi et al., 2001). In rodents, USVs can be predictors
of later-life emotion regulation; mice selectively bred based
on pup frequency of USVs develop into distinct high and
low-calling lines, and offspring of low-calling lines demonstrate
less anxiety-like behavior compared to the high-calling line
(Dichter et al., 1996; Brunelli et al., 1997). In 7-day old
mice, USV production can be modulated by anxiolytic and
anxiogenic drugs (Fish et al., 2004; Takahashi et al., 2009). The
present results are in contrast to what would be expected—if
high rates of USVs are suggestive of a higher predisposition
to become anxious, it would be expected that those mice
would demonstrate higher levels of inflammation and anxiety-
related behavior compared to low-calling mice. However, in the
current study, mice that showed low-calling rates demonstrated
higher levels of lung IL-5 gene expression, more anxiety-related
behavior, longer latencies to approach novelty and increased
hippocampal GR gene expression. These results are in the
opposite direction of what is expected, and they suggest that low-
callers, when faced with a challenge, increase their inflammatory
and anxiety-like symptoms. On the other hand, high-calling mice
may have more resources to respond to developmental challenges
and show fewer long-term adult consequences of adolescent
stressors.
Persistent Alteration to Lung Function
After Developmental Immune Challenges
Previous research has demonstrated how early life respiratory
events alter later life lung function. For example, in mice,
neonatal exposure to high concentrations of oxygen causes
changes in lung development that persists into adulthood
(Yee et al., 2009). Human data also indicate that children
who have persistent or severe asthma are more likely to
continue experiencing irregular lung function as adults and
are at higher risk for developing COPD (Pasterkamp et al.,
1997; Tai et al., 2014b). Additionally, children that experience
pneumonia in early life (before 3 years of age) have impaired
lung function in adolescence and adulthood compared to
subjects that never had pneumonia during this time (Chan
et al., 2015). In the current study, persistent lung alterations
following peri-adolescent allergen exposure may have accounted
for increased immobility in the FST, a classic test for depression-
related behaviors (McCormick and Green, 2013). HDM-exposed
mice still showed significantly elevated lung inflammation,
mucus and collagen levels at the time of FST testing, which
occurred 3 months after termination of allergen exposure. More
rapid and frequent immobility in the FST was likely an effect of
the persistent AI and associated decreased oxygen availability for
HDM-exposed mice, as opposed to ‘‘depression-like’’ symptoms
per se.
Other studies have demonstrated lasting airway inflammatory
processes in rodent asthma models. For example, LACK
peptide (a novel antigen) exposure used to induce asthma
symptoms in BALB/cAnN mice, beginning at 6 weeks of
age, led to inflammatory symptoms that persisted 5 and
8 weeks after the termination of antigen exposure (Julia et al.,
2002). In adult female BALB/cJ mice, intranasal exposure
to ovalbumin for 12 weeks led to significant eosinophilic
inflammation, goblet cell hyperplasia and collagen deposition
that resolved 4 weeks after final allergen exposure, and
lymphocyte inflammation and smooth muscle thickening took
8 weeks to resolve (Alrifai et al., 2014). Adult female
BALB/cJ mice exposed to ovalbumin periodically over a
55-day protocol demonstrated significant inflammation but
no airway hyper-responsiveness 1 month after ovalbumin
exposure was terminated (McMillan and Lloyd, 2004). Adult
female BALB/c mice exposed to ovalbumin every other
day, over an 8-week period, had lasting inflammation 2,
4, 6 and 8 weeks following the termination of allergen
exposure (Temelkovski et al., 1998). In the present study,
we demonstrated that 8 weeks of peri-adolescent exposure to
HDM led to persistent AI 11.5 weeks after the end of allergen
exposure, and that this inflammation was more pronounced
in females compared to males. These results were evident in
histological measures and in cytokine-related gene expression.
These persistent effects are notably longer than previously
documented persistent effects in adult mice, suggesting that
allergic processes that develop during childhood/adolescence
may take longer to resolve than allergic processes that begin in
adulthood.
In the present study, we demonstrate that lung inflammation,
mucus, collagen and allergic cytokine gene expression (IL-4 and
IL-5) are increased in adult mice 3 months after the completion
of chronic developmental allergen exposures. We have previously
documented more enhanced increases in inflammation, mucus
and lung gene expression 3 weeks after the completion of asthma
symptom exposure, but in this prior study there was no collagen
buildup at this early time point (Caulfield et al., 2017). In the
current study, airway remodeling, as indicated with collagen
buildup, was evident 3 months after completion of asthma
symptom exposures. These results suggest that some aspects of
lung function (inflammation, mucus, gene expression) persist for
a long time after allergen exposure, while aspects related to lung
structure (collagen build-up) require a longer time to fully form
(Tanaka et al., 2002; Antunes et al., 2010; Salmond et al., 2012).

Long-Term Effects of Peri-adolescent Asthma
Limitations and Future Directions
One limitation of the current study involves the dosing of MCH
between the LB and the AI+LB treatment groups. In order
to create similar LB and Penh values and to be conscious of
humane endpoints for the mice in the MCH administration
sessions, the dose of MCH (the bronchoconstriction agent) was
halved in mice exposed to both HDM and MCH (i.e., the
AI+LB group). Based on results from the current study, it
appears that in the AI+LB group, lung inflammation, gene
expression and behavior were qualitatively different from groups
that received only AI or only LB. Although, we found very
few statistical interactions of AI and LB, it is important
to note that the difference in MCH dosing in the AI+LB
group may limit the interpretation of results. Future work
should establish a better treatment protocol to induce both
AI and LB to understand synergistic effects of these asthma
symptoms.
Another potential limitation in the present study involved
the 2-min isolation method used to measure neonatal USV
rates. While brief isolation causes a stress response in the
pup, all pups experienced the same procedure, which was
conducted prior to manipulation of asthma symptoms. It is
possible that this early-life stress experience, prior to asthma
manipulations, may have masked or accentuated the asthma
effects reported here. However, this procedure allowed us to
control for pre-asthma anxiety-related behavior in individual
mice and to determine if early asthma symptoms lead to
elevated anxiety-like symptoms in individuals that are otherwise
predisposed toward anxiety. Further, we also used multiple
behavioral outcome measures in the current study. For an initial
exploratory study on potential long-term behavioral effects of
allergic asthma, we felt it was important to include multiple
behavioral outcomes. However, it is important acknowledge
that mouse responses to the latter tests (e.g., forced swim and
novelty exploration) may have been affected by earlier testing
experiences.
The findings from this study have important implications
for research on asthma therapy as it relates to anxiety- and
depression-related disorders. This is particularly true for
children and adolescents that mature with asthma symptoms
and inflammation and need to treat symptoms with chronic
pharmaceutical
regimes.
Specific
asthma
treatments
may
differentially influence mechanisms associated with anxiety
and/or depression, and these effects should be evaluated in
pre-clinical research. For example, many asthma patients are
treated with daily inhaled corticosteroids to control asthma
symptoms, and these treatments are effective in reducing
inflammation (Lee et al., 2008; Alrifai et al., 2014). These drugs
also lead to lasting effects on growth, adrenal function, and other
processes (Merkus et al., 1993; Hanania et al., 1995; Molimard
et al., 2008). However, little is known about how these treatments
may affect internalizing disorder susceptibility and associated
mechanisms. The current study provides a model in which
to test the long-term influence of asthma treatments on both
peripheral lung processes and more centralized mechanisms
associated with anxiety- and depression-related symptoms.
With this initial study completed, future studies can include
fewer extraneous control measures in order to minimize
potential confounds of early life stress effects on the developing
immune system. With fewer early stressors, future studies can
avoid experimental noise and provide a stronger signal for
interpretation.
CONCLUSION
In summary, the current study is the first to show that persistent
lung inflammation coincides with changes in brain gene
expression that are associated with emotion and stress regulation,
providing potential mechanisms by which developmental asthma
may increase risk for internalizing disorders in a rodent
model. This study also demonstrates that adolescent allergen-
induced lung inflammation, mucus and collagen buildup persist
several months after termination of allergen exposure. An
important caveat is that these long-term lung, brain and behavior
responses to developmental allergic asthma may differ for
males and females and may also differ depending on early life
temperament/traits. Future work is required to further identify
and test potential mechanisms, to determine the influence of
asthma treatments, and to identify processes that predispose
some individuals with developmental asthma to internalizing
disorders.
