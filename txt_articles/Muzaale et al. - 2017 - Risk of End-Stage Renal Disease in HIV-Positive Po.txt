New federal regulations allow HIV-positive individu-
als to be live kidney donors; however, potential can-
didacy for donation is poorly understood given the
increased risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
associated with HIV infection. To better understand
this risk, we compared the incidence of ESRD among
41 968 HIV-positive participants of North America
AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design
followed for a median of 5 years with the incidence
of ESRD among comparable HIV-negative partici-
pants of National Health and Nutrition Examination
III followed for a median of 14 years. We used risk
associations
from
multivariable
Cox
proportional
hazards regression to derive cumulative incidence
estimates for selected HIV-positive scenarios (no his-
tory of diabetes, hypertension, AIDS, or hepatitis C
virus coinfection)
and compared
these estimates
with those from similarly selected HIV-negative sce-
narios. For 40-year-old HIV-positive individuals with
health characteristics that were similar to those of
age-matched kidney donors, viral load <400 copies/
mL, and CD4+ count ≥500 cells/lL, the 9-year cumula-
tive incidence of ESRD was higher than that of their
HIV-negative peers, yet still low: 2.5 versus 1.1 per
10 000 among white women, 3.0 versus 1.3 per
10 000 among white men, 13.2 versus 3.6 per 10 000
among black women, and 15.8 versus 4.4 per 10 000
among black men. HIV-positive individuals with no
comorbidities and well-controlled disease may be
considered low-risk kidney donor candidates.

Introduction
The Human Immunodeficiency Virus Organ Policy Equity
Act of 2013 ended the ban on HIV-positive–to–HIV-positive
transplantation (1). For HIV-positive transplant candidates
on the deceased donor waiting list, the pool of available
organs may thus increase by 500–600 per year (2), the
time from listing to transplantation may decrease signifi-
cantly, and the benefits of transplantation may be realized
sooner (3,4). However, for HIV-positive transplant candi-
dates who wish to consider HIV-positive live kidney donor

 transplantation, concerns about the long-term risks to the
HIV-positive kidney donor may be a drawback (5).
An important risk associated with live kidney donation is
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (6–13). HIV-positive indi-
viduals may be considered to be too high risk for donor
nephrectomy because they have an increased risk of
ESRD compared with their HIV-negative counterparts,
especially in the presence of common risk factors such as
diabetes and hypertension (14–19). However, the addi-
tional risk of ESRD among HIV-positive individuals who
meet standard kidney donor eligibility criteria (20–22) and
who meet the Department of Health and Human Services
definition of well-controlled HIV infection (CD4+ T cell
count >500/lL for the 6-month period before donation,
HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL, no evidence of invasive oppor-
tunistic complications of HIV infection) (5) is unknown.
To evaluate the additional risk of ESRD in HIV-positive
potential live kidney donors, we estimated the cumula-
tive incidence of ESRD for various low-risk clinical sce-
narios based on age, race, renal function, HIV viral load,
and CD4+ count. We then compared these cumulative
incidence estimates with similar clinical scenarios in an
HIV-negative population.
Methods
Data source: HIV-positive potential donors
HIV-positive potential donors were drawn from the North American AIDS
Cohort
Collaboration
on
Research
and
Design
(NA-ACCORD).
NA-
ACCORD is a consortium of clinical and interval HIV cohorts from Canada
and the United States (23). It is one of seven regional collaborations of
the International Epidemiologic Databases to Evaluate AIDS supported by
the National Institutes of Health and draws participants from more than
100 clinical sites that represent HIV-positive individuals engaged in clinical
care (23,24). Each contributing cohort uses standardized cohort-specific
methods of data collection. At scheduled intervals, cohorts securely
transfer demographic, medication, laboratory, diagnosis, and vital status
information to the NA-ACCORD central Data Management Core (Univer-
sity of Washington), where data undergo quality control for completeness
and accuracy before they are combined into harmonized data files. The
data are subsequently sent to the Epidemiology/Biostatistics Core (Johns
Hopkins University), where they undergo additional quality control and
assembly into analytic data files. The human subject activities of the NA-
ACCORD and each participating cohort study have been reviewed and
approved by their corresponding local institutional review boards. Eleven
clinic-based cohorts (nine in the United States and two in Canada;
n = 41 968) within the NA-ACCORD used medical record evidence of
arteriovenous fistula placement, dialysis, and kidney transplantation to
validate cases of ESRD in clinical care between January 2000 and
December 2009 (25). The study end point was defined as the earliest
one of the following events (date of ESRD diagnosis, date of death, date
of cohort administrative censorship, or December 31, 2009).
Data source: HIV-negative potential donors
Healthy HIV-negative individuals were drawn from the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) (n = 16 025) (26).
In this survey medical information was obtained from patient self-report,
physical
examination,
and
radiologic
and
laboratory
test
results
at
NHANES III enrollment between 1988 and 1994. ESRD outcomes were
ascertained by linkage to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’s
medical evidence Form 2728 (certification of ESRD) and to the centers’
patient profile and death notification Form 2746 (including records
through September 30, 2008), as we have previously reported (10). ESRD
was defined as the initiation of maintenance dialysis or receipt of a kid-
ney transplant, whichever was identified first.
Cumulative incidence of ESRD
We evaluated the associations between the risk of ESRD and various
demographic and clinical characteristics for the HIV-positive cohort (NA-
ACCORD) and the HIV-negative cohort (NHANES III). To ensure model
stability (i.e. a sufficient number of events for multivariable regression),
we included individuals with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and esti-
mated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 45–90 mL/min/1.73 m2 (27), as
well as individuals with viral load of >400 copies/mL and CD4+ count of
<500 lL in the HIV-positive cohort. In both the HIV-positive and HIV-
negative cohorts, we considered age, race/ethnicity (white/other, black,
Hispanic), sex, presence or absence of diabetes mellitus or hypertension,
eGFR, smoking, body mass index (BMI), and HCV-positive serology. Addi-
tionally, in the HIV-positive cohort we considered HIV transmission risk
group (men who have sex with men, current or history of injection drug
use, heterosexual contact, other), years of antiretroviral therapy (ART)
use, tenofovir use (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF] formulation), HIV
viral load, CD4+ count, and history of AIDS. For the HIV-negative cohort,
we additionally considered urinary albumin:creatinine ratio and systolic
blood pressure (SBP). The final variables were selected based on
Akaike’s Information Criteria (28).
We estimated risk associations by using multivariable Cox proportional-
hazards regression separately for each cohort because the HIV-negative
cohort has no meaningful values for the HIV transmission risk group,
duration of ART use, duration of TDF use, HIV viral load, CD4+ count, and
history of AIDS; the entire HIV-positive cohort has no data on urinary
albumin:creatinine ratio, and >50% of the cohort has missing values for
SBP. However, a priori, we explored a joint model that included the HIV-
positive cohort and the HIV-negative cohort to test the hypothesis that
the effects of black race may vary by cohort. Post hoc, we also tested
the hypothesis that the effects of age and eGFR varied by cohort. In this
model, viral load was set to “suppressed” (i.e. <400 counts/mL), CD4+
count to 1000 cells/lL, and history of AIDS to “no” for the HIV-negative
cohort. The joint model included age, race, sex, diabetes, hypertension,
eGFR, smoking history, HCV, viral load, CD4+ count, history of AIDS, and
interaction terms for HIV status and age, race, sex, diabetes, and eGFR.
For both cohorts, a base-case scenario was defined to reflect the average
kidney donor in the United States: an SBP of 120 mm Hg, a urinary
albumin:creatinine ratio of 4 mg/g, no history of smoking, no diabetes,
and no hypertension (10). For the HIV-positive cohort, a low-risk scenario
was defined to reflect the average kidney donor characteristics as well as
the Department of Health and Human Services criteria for well-controlled
HIV infection: CD4+ T cell count >500/lL for the 6-month period before
donation, HIV-1 RNA of <50 copies/mL, and no evidence of invasive
opportunistic complications of HIV infection (5). The linear function for
each participant was centered on that of the base-case scenario within
each category of age, race, and sex. All reported cumulative incidence
estimates were derived from the following expression:
1 � e�R
h0ðtÞexpðXbÞ
where h0(t) is the nonparametric hazard for the base-case; exp(Xb) is the
maximum-likelihood estimate of the difference (on a log scale) between
the hazard for the base-case and the hazard for the specific clinical

 scenario with explanatory variables X; and t is the number of years of
follow-up (t = 9 for all reported analyses). In other words, Cox regression
on a vector of explanatory variables, X, yielded a vector of log hazard
ratios, b. The baseline survival function was subsequently obtained by
applying the value of zero to all explanatory variables in the mathematical
expression depicted here. To obtain the survival function for a given sce-
nario, we specified the difference in value (e.g. 5 years) between the
scenario (i.e. 45 years) and the base-case (40 years). To evaluate the Cox
proportional hazards assumption, we used the global test developed by
Therneau and Grambsch, which is equivalent to testing for a nonzero
slope in a generalized linear regression of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals
on functions of time. For our study, the global test suggested propor-
tional hazards (p = 0.4).
Statistical analysis
We compared the 9-year cumulative incidence of ESRD in HIV-positive
potential donors with HIV-negative potential donors. The difference in
cumulative incidence between HIV-positive potential donors and HIV-
negative potential donors was reported as the risk increase associated
with HIV infection. All analyses were performed using Stata 14.0/MP for
Linux (Stata Corp, College Station, TX). All hypothesis tests were two-
sided (a = .05).
Results
Study population
The
median
age
of
the
HIV-positive
cohort
was
41 years; 40% were black and 15% were Hispanic;
78% were male; and 2% had diabetes and 15% had
hypertension.
The
median
eGFR
was
104 mL/min/
1.73 m2, median SBP was 125 mm Hg, and median
BMI was 25 kg/m2. In addition, 74% reported having
ever smoked cigarettes, and 19% were hepatitis C virus
(HCV) coinfected. By HIV transmission risk group, 45%
were men who have sex with men, 33% were hetero-
sexual, 11% were current injection drug users or had a
history of injection drug use, and 12% were in other
categories. At study entry, median viral load was 926
copies/mL, 47% had initiated ART, 43% had suppressed
HIV viral load (<400 copies/mL), 32% had a CD4+ count
of >500 cells/lL, and 20% had AIDS. The median age
of the HIV-negative cohort was 42 years. Compared
with the HIV-positive cohort, the HIV-negative cohort
had a lower proportion of black (28%) and male (47%)
participants but a higher prevalence of participants with
diabetes (12%) and hypertension (26%). The median
albumin:creatinine ratio was 6 mg/g, median eGFR was
103 mL/min/1.73 m2, median SBP was 122 mm Hg,
and median BMI was 26 kg/m2. There were 49% who
reported ever smoking cigarettes, and 2% were HCV
seropositive (Table 1).
Risk of ESRD
In the HIV-positive cohort, there were 126 ESRD events
during a period of 212 804 person-years of follow-up; the
median follow-up was 5 years (interquartile range, 3–8
years). In the HIV-negative cohort, there were 114 ESRD
events during a period of 205 616 person-years of follow-
up; the median follow-up was 14 years (IQR, 12-15).

ESRD in HIV-Positive Kidney Donors
 Table 2 shows the associations between the risk of
ESRD and the demographic and clinical characteristics of
both cohorts at baseline. In the HIV-positive cohort, the
highest risks were observed among black individuals and
those with diabetes, hypertension, a low eGFR, a history
of smoking, HCV coinfection, a high viral load, a low CD4
count, a history of AIDS, and longer duration of exposure
to ART (but only among those with <9 years of previous
exposure to ART). In the HIV-negative cohort, the highest
risks were observed among black individuals and those
with diabetes, a low eGFR, a high urinary albumin:crea-
tinine ratio, a high SBP, a history of smoking, and HCV-
positive serology. Hypertension was not associated with
risk of ESRD in this cohort; however, an association was
observed in a sensitivity analysis that excluded urinary
albumin:creatinine ratio and SBP.
An inverse association was observed between age and
risk of ESRD in both the HIV-positive and HIV-negative
cohorts; however, this effect was not observed among
those
<50 years
old
in
the
HIV-negative
cohort
(p < 0.001 for interaction term for age <50 years and HIV
status; p = 0.4 for interaction term for age >50 years and
HIV
status).
Similarly,
an
inverse
association
was
observed between eGFR and risk of ESRD in both the
HIV-positive and HIV-negative cohorts; however, this
effect was not observed among those with an eGFR of
>90 mL/min/1.73 m2
in
the
HIV-negative
cohort
(p = 0.004 for interaction term for eGFR >90 mL/min/
1.73 m2 and HIV status; p = 0.4 for interaction term for
eGFR <90 and HIV status).
Black individuals had an increased risk of ESRD com-
pared with white individuals; however, this increase in
risk was greater than twofold higher in the HIV-positive
cohort compared with the HIV-negative cohort (p = 0.03
for interaction of black race and HIV status in a joint HIV-
positive and HIV-negative cohort model that excluded uri-
nary albumin:creatinine ratio and SBP).
Cumulative incidence of ESRD
The 9-year cumulative incidence of ESRD varied by
orders of magnitude from low-risk scenarios (e.g. three
ESRD events per 10 000 for a 40-year-old HIV-positive
white man with no history of diabetes, no hypertension,
eGFR of 95 mL/min/1.73 m2, no HCV coinfection, using
ART [including TDF] for 1 year, with suppressed viral
load, CD4+ count of >500 cells/lL, and no history of
AIDS) to high-risk/base-case scenarios (e.g. 115 ESRD
events per 10 000 for a 40-year-old HIV-positive black
man with no history of diabetes, no hypertension, eGFR
of 105 mL/min/1.73 m2, no HCV coinfection, and using
ART, but with a viral load of 100 000 copies/mL and
CD4+ count of 200 cells/lL) (Figure 1).
Risk increase associated with HIV infection
The 9-year cumulative incidence of ESRD varied consid-
erably by baseline eGFR. For the base-case of a 40-
year-old
patient,
the
9-year
cumulative
incidence
of
ESRD in the HIV-positive and HIV-negative cohorts was
2.5 versus 1.1 per 10 000 among white women, 3.0
versus 1.3 per 10 000 among white men, 13.2 versus
3.6 per 10 000 among black women, and 15.8 versus
4.4 per 10 000 among black men (Figure 2). For the
base case of a 50-year-old patient, the 9-year cumula-
tive incidence of ESRD in the HIV-positive and HIV-
negative cohorts was 1.5 versus 1.4 per 10 000 among
white women, 1.8 versus 1.6 per 10 000 among white
men, 8.0 versus 4.6 per 10 000 among black women,
and 9.5 versus 5.5 per 10 000 among black men. In
contrast, for the base case of a 30-year-old patient, the
9-year cumulative incidence of ESRD in the HIV-positive
and
HIV-negative
cohorts
was
3.6
versus
0.9
per
10 000
among
white
women,
4.3
versus
1.0
per
10 000 among white men, 19.3 versus 2.9 per 10 000
among black women, and 23.0 versus 3.5 per 10 000
among black men. The risk increase associated with
HIV varied substantially by baseline clinical characteris-
tics and was lowest for older white individuals older
than 40 years and highest for young black individuals
younger than 40 years (Table 3).
Discussion
In this North American cohort study of HIV-positive indi-
viduals, the 9-year risk of ESRD varied by orders of mag-
nitude across various clinical scenarios. However, in
subgroups with no comorbidities and well-controlled HIV
infection, the risk increase associated with HIV for the
base case of a 40-year-old patient was 1 per 10 000
among white women, 2 per 10 000 among white men,
10 per 10 000 among black women, and 11 per 10 000
among black men. For perspective, these estimates (par-
ticularly those for white individuals) are comparable to
the risk increase in HIV-negative potential donors associ-
ated with cigarette smoking (12), which is not a con-
traindication to kidney donation (one per 10 000 among
white women, one per 10 000 among white men, three
per 10 000 among black women, and four per 10 000
among black men) (20–22).
HIV infection may thus be viewed as a relative con-
traindication
to
kidney
donation
because
carefully
selected HIV-positive donor candidates may have an
acceptable risk of ESRD, comparable to the 1.8-fold
increase in risk observed among smokers in this study
and in the recent report by Grams et al (12). In contrast,
risk factors that are traditionally viewed as absolute con-
traindications to kidney donation are associated with sub-
stantially higher risks compared with smoking: 5.2-fold
increase
in
risk
associated
with
diabetes,

≥120 mm Hg, and 4.0-fold increase in risk per 10–mg/g
increase in urinary albumin:creatinine ratio. For these out-
lined reasons, a white HIV-positive potential donor with
1826

Muzaale et al
 no diabetes, no hypertension, no albuminuria, no history
of smoking, and well-controlled infection may be viewed
as a low-risk kidney donor candidate.
These findings and inferences reaffirm the observation
that the risk of ESRD in HIV-positive individuals corre-
lates directly with the quantity of replicating virus and, as

1We estimated the association of demographic and clinical characteristics with risk of ESRD separately for each cohort partly because
the effects of age, black race, hypertension, and eGFR varied significantly by cohort (p < 0.05 for interaction terms with HIV status in
a joint model in which viral load was coded as suppressed [i.e. 400 counts/mL], CD4+ count as 1000 cells/lL, and history of AIDS as
“no” in the HIV-negative cohort). Also, because the entire HIV-positive cohort has no data on urinary albumin:creatinine ratio and
>50% of the cohort has missing values for systolic blood pressure, we excluded these variables from the joint model (NA, not avail-
able in the HIV-positive cohort; not applicable to the HIV-negative cohort).
2An inverse association was observed between age and risk of ESRD in both the HIV-positive and HIV-negative cohorts; however, this
effect was not observed among those <50 years in the HIV-negative cohort (p < 0.001 for interaction between HIV status and age
<50 years; however, p = 0.4 for interaction HIV status and age >50 years).
3Black individuals had an increased risk of ESRD compared with white individuals; however, this increase in risk was significantly
higher (>2-fold higher) in the HIV-positive cohort compared with the HIV-negative cohort (p = 0.03 for interaction).
4Hypertension was associated with the risk of ESRD only in the HIV-positive cohort; however, the HIV-positive cohort model did not
account for urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio and systolic blood pressure. When albumin-to-creatinine ratio and systolic blood pressure
were excluded from the HIV-negative cohort model, hypertension was associated with the risk of ESRD (HR 2.0; 95% CI: 1.2–2.8;
p = 0.004).
5An inverse association was observed between eGFR and risk of ESRD in both the HIV-positive and HIV-negative cohorts; however,
this effect was not observed among those with eGFR >90 years in the HIV-negative cohort (p = 0.004 for interaction between those
with eGFR >90 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the HIV-positive versus the HIV-negative cohort; however, p = 0.4 for interaction between those
with eGFR <90 years in the HIV-positive versus the HIV-negative cohort).

 such, that the use of ART may reduce this risk substan-
tially (14,19,29). While our finding of a 3.2-fold higher risk
of ESRD in black compared with white HIV-negative indi-
viduals
is
consistent
with
well-established
literature
(30,31), our finding of a substantially stronger risk associ-
ation (6.9-fold higher) of ESRD in black compared with
white HIV-positive individuals is consistent with more
recent and emerging literature (14,15,19,32). In this liter-
ature, there is compelling evidence that high-risk APOL1
haplotypes—found in individuals with African ancestry—
might interact biologically with HIV infection (33). Accord-
ing to studies of renal biopsy reports, HIV-positive indi-
viduals with high-risk APOL1 haplotypes have a much
higher risk of developing the collapsing variant of focal
segmental glomerulosclerosis and, as such, a much
higher likelihood of rapid progression to ESRD (15).
Data on APOL1 haplotypes were not available to us for
this study, limiting the inferences we may make. While
approximately 13% of African Americans in the general
population have two high-risk APOL1 alleles, this preva-
lence estimate may not be generalizable to a population
of kidney donor candidates and, as such, the diagnostic
yield
from
genotyping
HIV-positive
potential
donors
remains unknown. But our findings support the view that
risk of ESRD is best understood in terms of a number of
risk factors that a given individual harbors, because the
risk of ESRD varies by orders of magnitude among black
individuals (8–100+ events per 10 000 in our study). It is
plausible, for instance, that an individual with two high-
risk APOL1 alleles may not develop progressive renal dis-
ease in the absence of other “hits,” including diabetes,
hypertension, cigarette smoking, uncontrolled HIV in-
fection, HCV coinfection, and possibly other genetic
risks (34).
A second limitation of our study was that we were not
able to adjust for as many baseline risk factors in the HIV-
positive cohort as in the HIV-negative cohort, including
urinary albumin:creatinine ratio and SBP. This may have
limited our ability to stratify risk in the HIV-positive popula-
tion and we may have overestimated the risk increase
associated with HIV in the low-risk HIV-positive scenarios
we describe. That said, in all low-risk HIV-positive scenar-
ios we describe, participants had been using an ART regi-
men including older formulations of TDF for 1 year; those
using TDF are likely to have been clinically screened and
closely monitored for renal disease (urinalysis for albumin-
uria). For these reasons, it is plausible that in the low-risk
scenarios we describe, the urine albumin:creatinine ratio
was similar to that in comparable base-case scenarios in
the HIV-negative cohort. In the future, individuals may
switch to newer formulations of tenofovir (tenofovir alafe-
namide) that are safer for the kidneys than TDF (35).

1All HIV-positive scenarios specify the following characteristics: male sex, 1 year of ART use (including tenofovir), suppressed virus
(<400 copies/mL), CD4+ count >500 cells/lL no diabetes, and no HCV coinfection; all HIV-negative scenarios specify the following
characteristics: male sex, albumin:creatinine ratio 4 mg/g, SBP 120, no diabetes, and no HCV coinfection. Because these are hypothet-
ical scenarios of potential HIV-positive donors, they do not include absolute contraindications to live kidney donation (presence of dia-
betes mellitus and HCV coinfection); however, two scenarios include a relative contraindication to live kidney donation (hypertension).

bility criteria for kidney donation). The expected eGFR for each age varied significantly by race after accounting for sex, diabetes,
hypertension, urinary albumin:creatinine ratio, SBP, BMI, and history of smoking. The magnitude of the difference between white and
black individuals (approximately 10 mL/min/1.73 m2) was observed consistently across three populations: live kidney donors (Scientific
Registry of Transplant Recipients), HIV-negative potential live kidney donors (NHANES III) (41,42), and HIV-positive potential live kidney
donors (NA-ACCORD) (data not shown).

ESRD in HIV-Positive Kidney Donors
 Continuous and long-term health care may, as such, be a
crucial factor in the long-term health of HIV-positive kid-
ney donors. By extension, longitudinal data on use of
ART, HIV viral load, and CD4 count may indicate an asso-
ciation between good adherence to ART, adequate viral
control, and the best clinical outcomes. In this analysis,
we did not adjust for these longitudinal variables because
they are drawn from a time after the hypothetical “deci-
sion to donate”; however, donors should be informed
about the potential benefits of regular postdonation care
with the caveat that the association between postdona-
tion healthcare and risk of ESRD remains unknown for
both HIV-positive and HIV-negative populations. Granted,
our findings suggest that individuals with well-controlled
infection at baseline subsequently had, on average, a low
risk of ESRD.
While the association between baseline hypertension
and risk of ESRD was observed only in the HIV-positive
cohort, this is most likely because in the HIV-positive
cohort model we did not adjust for both urine albumin:
creatinine ratio and BP (markers of glomerular disease
and secondary hypertension) (36–38). When both these
variables were excluded from the HIV-negative cohort
model, an association was observed between hyperten-
sion and risk of ESRD in a magnitude comparable to that
observed in the HIV-positive cohort. Also, although we
were able to adjust for BMI, a known risk factor for
ESRD (39,40), in our exploratory analyses BMI was not
significantly associated with ESRD in the HIV-positive
cohort, so we did not include it in the final model. How-
ever, this might merely reflect the limited follow-up dura-
tion of our study.
Because we report 9-year cumulative incidence esti-
mates, a third limitation of our study was the short
duration of follow-up. Ideally, the HIV-positive potential
donor would wish to know the magnitude of the addi-
tional lifetime risk of ESRD associated with donation.
To obtain this estimate, we would need data on the
projected lifetime risk of ESRD for HIV-positive poten-
tial donors in the absence of donation as well as data
on the projected lifetime risk of ESRD for HIV-positive
individuals in the event of donation; however, these
data do not exist. Data from HIV-negative individuals
suggest that donation is associated with a 4- to 11-fold
increase in risk of ESRD (depending on race and sex),
but the generalizability of these estimates to HIV-posi-
tive donors remains unknown (9,10,12). That said, in
this study we provide the first description, to the best
of our knowledge, of the risk of ESRD among highly
select HIV-positive individuals who may be considered
for live donor nephrectomy. In this selected population,
the 9-year adjusted risk was lowest for older HIV-
positive individuals and highest for the young. This
inverse association, which we have previously reported
(19), might reflect selective survival of healthier individ-
uals; older age might represent a better risk profile
and slower kidney disease progression in a manner
that we were not able to characterize using the data
available to us.
Our study also had several strengths worth considering.
As a representative study of all HIV-positive individuals in
care in North America (23,24), the inferences we make
are generalizable to the US population of HIV-positive
potential donors. Because we compared the risk of
ESRD in HIV-positive potential donors with the risk in a
representative
population
of
HIV-negative
potential
donors in the United States (26), we were able to quan-
tify the risk increase associated with HIV in potential
donors. Also, our analytic approach allowed us to explore
a wide range of scenarios that may guide decision-
making in the unprecedented clinical setting ushered in
by the recent passage of the Human Immunodeficiency
Virus Organ Policy Equity Act of 2013. We have demon-
strated biological gradients of risk based on renal func-
tion, viral load, CD4+ count, and various other clinical
characteristics. Thus, the clinician and HIV-positive poten-
tial donor may make decisions based on a combination
of health characteristics of the prospective donor. Finally,
we used validated and comparable methods to ascertain
ESRD in both the HIV-positive and HIV-negative popula-
tions; thus, our findings are unlikely to be explained by
differential ascertainment of the study outcome between
the cohorts.
In conclusion, the carefully selected HIV-positive donor
may face a real but acceptable additional risk of ESRD.
Whether careful selection of black HIV-positive donors
should entail genotyping for the high-risk APOL1 haplo-
types is an important issue to explore in follow-up studies.
