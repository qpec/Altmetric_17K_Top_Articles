Abstract
The heterogeneity of an individual patient's tumor has been
linked to treatment resistance, but quantitative biomarkers to
rapidlyandreproducibly evaluateheterogeneityina clinicalsetting
are currently lacking. Using established tools available in a College
of American Pathologists–accredited and Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments–certified clinical laboratory, we quan-
tified digital pathology features on 9,225 individual circulating
tumor cells (CTC) from 179 unique metastatic castration-resistant
prostatecancer(mCRPC)patientstodefinephenotypicallydistinct
celltypes.Heterogeneitywasquantifiedonthe basisofthediversity
of cell types in individual patient samples using the Shannon index
and associated with overall survival (OS) in the 145 specimens
collected prior to initiation of the second or later lines of therapy.
Low CTC phenotypic heterogeneity was associated with better OS
in patients treated with androgen receptor signaling inhibitors
(ARSI), whereas high heterogeneity was associated with better OS
in patients treated with taxane chemotherapy. Overall, the results
show that quantifying CTC phenotypic heterogeneity can help
inform the choice between ARSI and taxanes in mCRPC patients.

Introduction
The heterogeneity of cancer has long been recognized by
phenotypic differences in cell morphology within a tumor spec-
imen, and the observation that disease is rarely eliminated with
any single systemic therapy. Recent multi-gene sequencing efforts
have extended the concept of intrapatient cancer heterogeneity to
the single cell (1, 2), further revealing immense diversity in tumors
between patients (3, 4), individual lesions within the samepatient
(5, 6), and different sites within each lesion (7, 8). It is therefore
unsurprising that reliance on solid tissue biopsies to guide "pre-
cision medicine" is not so precise (9, 10). Recently reported
profiling studies continue to elucidate the genomic complexity
of cancer. Most are observational and are not reported as
biomarkers that can be associated with clinical outcomes or used
to impact medical decision making in patients (11, 12). Here, we
report the development of a quantitative biomarker of CTC
heterogeneity fit-for-purpose (13) of informing treatment selec-
tion at the time a change in therapy is needed, and explore the
relationship between CTC phenotypic heterogeneity and patient
survival following treatment with androgen receptor signaling
inhibitors (ARSI) or taxane chemotherapies.
It has been hypothesized that the efficacy of pathway-specific
targeted agents would be inversely related to the degree of intra-
patient heterogeneity present when a therapy is administered
(Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1D; refs. 8, 14, 15). The currently
approved standard-of-care life-prolonging systemic therapies
for progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer
(mCRPC) include two therapeutic drug classes: pathway-specific
ARSI and non-pathway–specific taxane-based chemotherapy.
ARSI, such as abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, and apaluta-
mide, target the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway, and
inhibit the growth of cells dependent on AR signaling for survival,
while taxane-based chemotherapies, docetaxel and cabazitaxel,
stabilize microtubules, broadly inhibiting cell division in all cells,
including those that harbor diverse drivers of resistance to targeted
therapy (16).
In current clinical practice, the choice between one therapy over
another at a decision point in mCRPC management is largely
empiric; the biology of an individual patient's cancer is typically
not considered. In the first-line setting following progression on
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), most patients are treated
with an ARSI over a taxane based on the high response rates, more
favorable safety profile, and long survival times at this decision

 point (17, 18). This contrasts with the second- or later line setting
where there is no consensus on management because the response
to sequential ARSI is lower and of shorter duration, and response
to the first does not predict response to the other (19). Every
treatment to which a tumor has been exposed can alter the biology
of the cancer (20), necessitating the serial profiling of disease.
Validated therapy-guiding biomarkers to better inform each treat-
ment decision is a significant unmet medical need (21).
High intratumor and intrapatient heterogeneity has been asso-
ciated with poor prognosis in small cohorts of patients with breast
and head and neck cancer (22, 23) and more recently in lung
cancer (24). Expanded explorations of the relationship between
heterogeneity and other clinical outcomes have been hindered by
the range of sampling methods to obtain tumor, the range of
devices and analytic methods, and the lack of analytically and
clinically validated assays. CTCs are a source of tumor material for
biologic profiling that can be obtained from routine, repeated
phlebotomy samples with minimal patient discomfort. CTCs can
represent multiple metastatic lesions at once and are more likely
to provide information on the diversity of a patient's disease than
a single site biopsy. However, existing single-cell genomic tech-
niques (25) have yet to meet the regulatory requirements of
analytic and clinical validity, turnaround time, and cost for more
widespread clinical utility.
In contrast, automated phenotypic (protein and morphologic)
assessment of single cells has established clinical utility in the
arena of cytologic assessment of Pap smears for cervical cancer
detection. In this report, we captured CTCs utilizing an analyti-
cally validated microscopy-based CTC detection technology (26)
that allows for quantification of protein expression, and further
characterized individual cells by digital pathology features pre-
viously validated and FDA approved for clinical use to identify
and characterize malignant cells in Pap smears (27–29).
Our central hypothesis is that the degree of pretherapy pheno-
typic heterogeneity of CTCs inversely associates with patient
survival following treatment with ARSI but not taxane therapy.
To test this, individual features in each cell were used to define
phenotypically distinct cell types. Heterogeneity was then quan-
tified on the basis of the diversity of individual cell types in each
patient sample using the Shannon index. The Shannon index is
widely utilized in ecology and biodiversity research to measure
the diversity or entropy of species, or in this case, CTCs. Previous
applications of the Shannon index include showing differences in
the genomic heterogeneity of separate and distinct metastatic
lesions in an individual patient (30), and along with other
measures, to predict the transition from Barrett esophagus to
esophageal adenocarcinoma (31). Here, we associated this quan-
titative heterogeneity biomarker with overall survival (OS) fol-
lowing treatment with standard-of-care drug classes to demon-
strate clinical utility: that patient outcomes can be improved by
using the heterogeneity biomarker test result to inform the choice
of treatment relative to nonuse of the test result. We also evaluated
whether observed phenotypic heterogeneity was associated with
the presence of multiple genomic clones, elucidated by single-cell
sequencing of CTCs in a subset of patient samples.
Patients and Methods
Study design
This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively accrued cross-
sectional cohort of patients treated in a clinical practice setting at
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC, New York,
NY). All patients provided signed informed consent for partici-
pation on a MSKCC Institutional Review Board/Privacy Board–
approved protocol prior to blood sampling and studies were
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Bel-
mont Report, and U.S. Common Rule. The choice of therapy was
at the discretion of the treating physician. All patients underwent a
history that included details of the stage of disease at diagnosis,
initial management, subsequent systemic therapies, physical
examination, and laboratory studies including complete blood
count, chemistry panel [albumin (ALB), alkaline phosphatase
(ALK), lactate dehydrogenases (LDH), hemoglobin (Hgb), pros-
tate specific antigen (PSA)], and serum testosterone to confirm
castration status (<50 ng/dL; Table 1).
Patient selection
Between December 2012 and March 2015, 265 patients with
histologically confirmed mCRPC undergoing a change in systemic
therapy for progressive disease were treated at MSKCC. Of these,
179 unique patients starting an ARSI (abiraterone, enzalutamide,
or apalutamide) or taxane (docetaxel, cabazitaxel, or paclitaxel)
provided 319 samples (221 pretherapy and 98 on-therapy sam-
ples), which formed two cohorts of samples (Table 1; Fig. 1). The
first, the CTC contributing cohort, included all 319 samples and
was used for automated feature extraction of protein biomarker
expression and digital pathology features (Fig. 2A). The second,
the clinical association cohort, is a subset of the CTC contributing
cohort that consists only of samples obtained prior to the start of
the second- or later line therapy (86 ARSI and 59 taxane, or 145
total pretherapy samples). First-line samples were excluded
because the majority of mCRPC patients progressing on standard
hormones are treated with an ARSI due to the high response rate.
Few receive taxanes in the first line, limiting the ability to explore
the association of heterogeneity with outcome to both drug
classes. There were no additional exclusions; all available samples
were included in the analysis.
CTC collection
Blood samples (7.5 mL) were collected in Streck tubes and
processed at MSKCC or shipped to Epic Sciences and processed
within 48 hours. Red blood cells were lysed, and approximately
3 � 106 nucleated cells were dispensed onto 10–16 glass micro-
scope slides and placed at �80�C for long-term storage as
described previously (26, 32, 33). Sample processing and testing
were conducted in laboratories following both Clinical Labora-
tory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) and College of American
Pathologists (CAP) regulations.
CTC immunofluorescent staining and detection
CTCs were characterized by automated immunofluorescent
staining for DAPI (a DNA stain), cytokeratins, CD45 (hemato-
poietic lineage marker), and AR N-terminal domain (AR; Cell
Signaling Technology; D6F11) as described previously (26, 32,
33). Up to two slides were evaluated per sample tested. CTCs were
identified using fluorescent scanners that imaged every nucleated
object on the slides. All CTCs had an intact nucleus (DAPI), no
CD45 signal, and morphologic features consistent with malig-
nancy, as published previously (26). Clinical laboratory scientists
(licensed in California) conducted final quality control of CTC
identification.

 Individual CTC biomarker and digital pathology
We built upon digital pathology software from FDA-cleared
devices used to characterize Pap smears for the context of use of
diagnosing cervical cancer (27–29) to characterize CTCs. A sys-
tematic analysis performed by key leaders in the field identified
the features that for decades were repeatedly found to be the most
diagnostically meaningful in cytopathology, histopathology, and
hematopathology applications (34). A subset of these features
was found to be suitable for the magnification of the microscope
objectives utilized by the Epic Sciences platform. All features
considered were measured, and part of the raw data used for
analyses, listed in Fig. 2A.
To allow for quantification of digital pathology features on a
cell-by-cell basis, individual CTC images of cytokeratin (CK),
nuclear, and AR N-terminal staining were segmented from each
fluorescence channel image independently utilizing a library of
single-cell
features
optimized
for
fluorescence
microscopy
(Fig. 2A; ref. 34). Features utilized for this analysis included
morphometric and texture patterns of nuclear and CK staining,
as well as the densitometry (intensity) of the CK and AR signal,
which were quantified as a ratio of signal intensity on the CTC
relative to surrounding white blood cells (WBC; Fig. 2A). The
identification of a cluster of two or more CTCs was recorded as a
categorical dichotomous variable, as was whether the level of CK
and AR expression was above or below an analytic threshold of
intensity (Fig. 2A) based on cultured cell line control cells spiked
into healthy donor blood as described previously (26). Apoptotic
CTCs were not included or reported, in part because nuclear
fragmentation and membrane blebbing (35) confound the digital
pathology features.
CTC mathematical phenotype identification and Shannon
index
Use of the Shannon index necessitated defining unique "spe-
cies" within a given space. These "species" were defined using an
unsupervised clustering analysis of the CTC protein, digital
pathology, and categorical features (Fig. 2B) into phenotypically
similar subtypes of CTCs from all samples in the CTC contributing
cohort. To enable cross-feature comparisons, minimize digital
pathology feature redundancy, and distill the distinct sources of
variance in the data, quantified biomarkers and features were
z-score transformed prior to dimensionality reduction via prin-
cipal component analysis, with the number of principal compo-
nents selected via standard 85% variance inclusion (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S2A).
K-means clustering was then used to group similar CTCs into
discrete phenotypic cell subtypes based on the principal compo-
nents of digital pathology features while minimizing the amount
of variance of biomarker and feature ranges within each "cluster,"
or group. The number of clusters ('k') was selected by the "elbow
method" by which the within cluster sum of squares for k ¼ 1 to
k ¼ 40 is plotted, and a human analyst looks for a bend in the
curve, signifying a point of diminishing returns where partition-
ing the data into additional clusters (more 'k') only marginally
adds to the similarity within each cluster (Supplementary Fig.
S2B). All CTCs in the cohort were then assigned a phenotypic cell
subtype ("A"–"O"; Fig. 3A and B) reflecting the mathematical
unsupervised cluster (not to be confused with a histologic cluster,
or clump of CTCs traveling together within the bloodstream) and
then grouped by their individual protein, digital pathology, and
categorical features (Fig. 4A).
Next, the patient-level frequency of the defined CTC pheno-
typic subtypes (categorized as "A"–"O"/mL) were determined on
a per sample basis (Fig. 4B). These "species densities" were then
utilized to calculate a Shannon index for each sample in the
clinical association cohort (R package "vegan") that quantified the
entropy of the individual CTC phenotypic subtypes present at the
time of the blood draw (Fig. 4B). A higher Shannon index
indicates both a higher number of different "species" (CTC
phenotypic subtypes) present, as well as a more random distri-
bution of those phenotypic subtypes, meaning that it would be
more difficult, compared with lower Shannon index samples, to
predict which phenotypic subtypes would be seen next given
additional observation. If 0 or 1 CTCs were present, a value of zero
is generated due to no sample present or the presence of only a
single-cell subtype.

 Posttreatment outcomes
Overall survival (OS) was calculated from initiation of therapy
to death from any cause. Patients still alive at the time of last
follow-up were right-censored.
Statistical analyses
Patient demographics and clinical characteristics at the time
of blood draw were evaluated by descriptive statistics. c2 and
Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare treatment
groups for categorical and continuous characteristics, respectively.
Median survival time as a function of a patient's continuous
heterogeneity measure was evaluated using nonparametric kernel
estimates (R package "sm,"; ref. 36). Time-to-event outcomes,
categorized by group, were evaluated with the Kaplan–Meier
method. Differences in time-to-event outcomes between catego-
rized groups were evaluated using the maximum log-rank test,
where the grouping was determined adaptively from the data (37).
The association of heterogeneity with time-to-event outcomes
was additionally evaluated with HRs estimated from univariable
and multivariable Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression
methods. Continuous variables with right-skewed distributions
were transformed by log2(x þ 1) to establish a normal distribu-
tion. The pretherapy features evaluated for the multivariable Cox
PH models included line of therapy (2, 3, or 4þ, as factors),
visceral metastases (present vs. not), pretherapy PSA (continuous,
log2 þ1), LDH (continuous, log2 þ1), ALK (continuous, log2 þ1),
Hgb (continuous), ALB (continuous), patient age (continuous),
CTC/mL (continuous, log2 þ1), Shannon index (continuous),

 and therapy class (taxane vs. ARSI). These pretherapy features were
individually assessed for correlation with Shannon index (Sup-
plementary Fig. S3).
Visceral metastases, patient age, and ALB were excluded from
the final model by using a stepwise selection method based on
univariate proportional hazards (Schoenfeld residuals P > 0.05)
and univariate significance with outcome (P < 0.05). Included in
the models is the interaction between Shannon index and therapy
administered. CTC enumeration was also tested for an interaction
with therapy and heterogeneity index because of its correlation to
Shannon index. All earlier line samples from patients who con-
tributed multiple pretherapy samples but ultimately expired were
right censored. In addition, the robust sandwich estimate for the
covariance matrix was implemented for all Cox PH models to
correct for possible underestimation of variance (38). All statis-
tical tests were two-sided and performed at the 5% significance
level. Data consolidation was conducted using KNIME. Statistical
analyses utilized the R packages: "survival," "stats," "sm," "vegan,"
and "maxstat." Graphical representations were generated with
R packages: "ggplot2," "gridExtra," "scales," "survminer," and
"ggthemes."
CTC isolation, genome amplification, and next-generation
sequencing
Methods for CTC relocation, picking, and sequencing have
been described previously (39, 40). In brief, individual CTCs
were relocated and recovered from assayed slides using the
Eppendorf TransferMan NK4 micromanipulator. Single-cell
whole genome amplification (WGA) was performed using the
SeqPlex enhanced DNA amplification kit (Sigma). Shotgun librar-
ies were constructed from 100 ng of WGA material using the
NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit and sequenced to approx-
imately 0.3� depth by 2 � 150 bp PE sequencing.
Genome wide copy number variation (CNV) analysis was
performed using the Epic Sciences single-cell CNV analysis pipe-
line. FASTQ files were aligned to hg38 human reference genome
from UCSC Genome database. BAM files were filtered for MAPQ
30 reads, followed by two separate analyses for genome-wide
profiling (pipeline 1) and individual gene copy number changes
determination (pipeline 2). Pipeline 1: Hg38 human genome was
divided into approximately 3,000 1M bp bins and counted across
bins for each cell. Read counts per bin were normalized against
WBC controls, and the circular binary segmentation algorithm
(R Bioconductor package "DNAcopy") was used to segment DNA
copy number data (log2-normalized ratio, sample/reference) and
identify abnormal copy number. Pipeline 2: reads were counted
for each gene and for each sample, and normalized against the
total sequencing reads for the particular sample. Normalized
reads were compared with reference WBCs and z-scores were
calculated for each gene. Z-score of > 3 and < �3 are used as
significant cutoff for calling gene gain or loss.

 samples from patients about to start a second- or later line of
systemic therapy for mCRPC.
Mathematical phenotype identification in pretherapy and
on-therapy samples
CTC phenotypic heterogeneity was evaluated using the Shan-
non index, which measures the entropy of species or, in this case,
the phenotypically defined CTC subtypes (Fig. 2B)
Unsupervised clustering of all of the single-cell features (Fig.
4A) from the 9,225 CTCs identified from the 319 samples in the
CTC contributing cohort revealed a k of 15 (Supplementary Fig.
S2B), which was used to "define" or classify individual cells into
15 phenotypic subtypes ("A"–"O") where the cells were more
similar to members of the subtype to which they were categorized
relative to the other 14 subtypes (Fig. 3). Each phenotypic subtype
represents a unique signature of the single-cell features (Fig. 4A).
Each patient sample was then evaluated for the diversity of the
defined CTC subtypes present in a blood draw, and quantified
using the Shannon index (see Patients and Methods, Fig. 4B).
Examples of CTCs from low Shannon index (Fig. 4C) and high
Shannon index (Fig. 4D) samples are shown.
Intersample Shannon index is related to overall survival of
ARSI, but not taxanes
The relationship between Shannon index (phenotypic entropy)
and OS following treatment with a pathway-specific targeted ARSI
or taxane chemotherapy was analyzed on a continuous basis with
estimates of median survival by Shannon index (see Patients
and Methods) separated by therapy administered (ARSI or
taxanes; Fig. 5A). While median survival estimates remained
constant for patients on taxanes with respect to Shannon index,
the median survival of patients on ARSI was longer than on
taxanes with comparable Shannon index at the low end. In
contrast, patients with high Shannon index on ARSI had shorter
median survival than those on taxanes with comparable Shannon
index on the high end. This relationship was further visualized
with Kaplan–Meier plots for each therapy class with patient
populations dichotomized by the crossover point (Fig. 5A,
arrow). Patients going onto ARSI (Fig. 5B) had a large difference
in survival between "high" and "low" Shannon index samples
(median OS: 8.8 months vs. 28.1 months, P ¼ 0.0015), whereas
patients going onto taxanes (Fig. 5C) did not (11.4 months vs.
12.9 months, P ¼ 1).
Multivariate analyses
To correct for potential imbalances in the demographics of the
pre-ARSI and pretaxane patient samples due to greater use of the
former in the second line and the latter in the third- or later line
setting, we evaluated survival in the context of a multivariate Cox
PH model utilizing known prognostic factors (see Patients and
Methods). Integrated into the Cox PH model was the interaction
between CTC phenotypic entropy (Shannon index) and therapy

 class (taxanes vs. ARSI). CTC enumeration was also considered as
an interaction term with therapy class (see Materials and Meth-
ods), and while there was an interaction (data not shown), the
interaction between Shannon index and therapy class was stron-
ger. Of note, there remained a significant interaction between
increasing Shannon index and higher risk of death on ARSI
relative to taxanes (HR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.22–5.03; P ¼
0.0119; Fig. 5D and E), even when adjusting for pretherapy
prognostic factors. To assess the possibility that the observed
treatment interaction effects are being driven by low Shannon
index due to inclusion of samples with 0 or 1 CTCs, we created a
separate model in which we excluded these samples and kept
those from the clinical association cohort with a Shannon index
greater than 0. The same trends as previously described were
upheld (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B).
The Pleomorphism index
The relationship between phenotypic heterogeneity, drug class,
and OS was additionally evaluated with an alternate measure of
intrapatient phenotypic variance: the Pleomorphism index (see
Supplementary Methods). Similar to the Shannon index, patients
with low Pleomorphism index had longer survival on ARSI, and
patients with high Pleomorphism index had longer survival on
taxanes, observed as a continuous marker in univariate and
multivariate settings (Supplementary Figs. S5A and S5B and
S6A–S6E).
Heterogeneous genomic profiles identify frequent subclonal
drivers of ARSI resistance observed in high phenotypic
heterogeneity samples
Randomly selected CTCs from 17 patient samples, each with
10 or more CTCs, were single-cell sequenced to assess intra-
sample genomic heterogeneity with CNVs. From a time and
resource perspective, it is currently impractical to individually
sequence all CTCs in each sample to inform clinical decisions.
However, we still sought to explore genomic heterogeneity at
the single-cell level in a subset of samples using these research
tools.
Shown are two examples of patient samples with multiple
distinct genomic profiles with unique CNV patterns (Fig. 6A and
B). One patient (Fig. 6A) had 22 CTCs sequenced and appears to
have two major genomic patterns (I and II). Three sub-patterns
were observed in pattern II with additional chromosome Y loss or
a chr5q deletion, indicated by the red circles in Fig. 6A. The second
patient (Fig. 6B) had 62 CTCs sequenced and four major genomic
patterns identified (I–IV). Pattern II had many chromosomal
breakpoints and alterations, including chr8p loss and 8q gain,
which commonly occur in prostate cancer, and III and IV had

 single chromosome loss or gain. This patient also had nine
additional CTCs that did not fit any of the four major genomic
patterns identified in Fig. 6B, each instead representing its own
unique pattern. These samples also had high Shannon index
scores of phenotypic heterogeneity, and are provided as examples
of the diverse genomic profiles observed in patient samples. They
are not intended to offer correlations between phenotypic and
genotypic heterogeneity. Properly powered comparisons between
phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity are planned for future
work.
A limitation of this analysis is the reliance on CNVs, as the
single-cell sequencing technique utilized does not measure muta-
tions or translocations that could reveal additional intercellular
diversity. For example, common driver mutations in prostate
cancer include alterations like SPOP mutations, AR mutations,
and ERG rearrangements, which were not seen with these CNV
analyses but very well could exist in the flat genomes shown in
Pattern I of Fig. 6A and B.
A broader view of CTCs sequenced from high phenotypic
heterogeneity samples showed varying degrees of subclonal gain
or loss of key alterations known to drive resistance to ARSI (Fig.
6C). No patients were dominated by what is a more-or-less clonal
genotype (i.e., white or black, but not gray tiles). Instead, most
patients had many "gray" areas representing subclonal alterations
of other drivers, suggesting that a single dominant clone was not
identified or not present across all CTCs.
Certain alterations appeared to be more clonal than others,
such as MYC, which when amplified, appeared in high propor-
tions of CTCs within a patient sample. Other alterations, such as
AR amplification, appeared frequently as subclones. These obser-
vations are consistent with intrapatient tumor clonality analyses
(41), where MYC and AR amplifications identified in tissue
biopsies were primarily truncal and subclonal, respectively, in a
cohort of 10 autopsies. In contrast, the analysesreported here were
conducted on cells from living patients, with the potential to use
results to inform clinical decision making.
Discussion
Developing biomarkers of heterogeneity to guide treatment
selection and improve patient outcomes is an unmet medical
need. Our objective was to develop a quantitative CTC hetero-
geneity biomarker assay that has achieved the level of method
validation to be fit-for-purpose (13) of exploring its relation-
ship to survival in mCRPC patients treated with an ARSI or
taxane therapy. To do so, we retrospectively applied the Shan-
non index to prospectively collected and clinically annotated
patient samples about to start a second or later line of

 treatment. The analysis showed that patient survival on taxanes
was unrelated to the degree of heterogeneity, while lower
heterogeneity scores were associated with a longer median
survival on ARSI relative to taxanes, and higher heterogeneity
with shorter median survival on ARSI relative to taxanes. A
significant interaction was also observed between the Shannon
index (Fig. 5D and E) and therapy class in multivariate models
correcting for potential intra-cohort imbalances. The results
support the hypothesis that CTC phenotypic heterogeneity
measured prior to starting systemic therapy associates with
differential outcomes on pathway-specific hormonal agents but
not on non-pathway–specific chemotherapy.
As noted by a recent heterogeneity focus group, there are no
standard methods to quantify heterogeneity, or consensus on
whether the method to evaluate heterogeneity should be genetic,
transcriptomic, phenotypic, epigenetic, or a combination thereof
(42). All may prove relevant. It is critical to develop and test the
association of a reproducibly measurable heterogeneity biomark-
er(s) with clinical outcomes: the context of use for which the
biomarker result will be used to inform treatment decisions in the
clinic. The outcome explored here was OS.
In this analysis, we expanded upon previously validated
digital pathology features that were components of FDA-
cleared devices for single-cell characterization with proven
clinical utility for detecting cervical cancers from cytology Pap
smears and applied these same tools to characterize CTCs
phenotypically. Relative to single-site biopsies, CTCs can orig-
inate from multiple tumor sites within a patient, and provide a
more global picture of an individual patient's cancer. In
contrast to single-site biopsies, the acquisition of CTCs
through phlebotomy poses minimal risk to the patient, and
is amenable to repeated sampling to monitor disease evolu-
tion over time.
Critical to the assessment of intrapatient heterogeneity in CTCs
is a CTC detection method that does not rely on pre-enrichment
by epitope, size, or shape. These positive selection methods often
miss critical CTC subtypes and do not consistently assess cell
features essential to the analysis of heterogeneity. The CAP-accre-
dited and CLIA-certified Epic Sciences platform used here has
undergone the necessary analytic validation (accuracy, linearity,
specificity, and intra/interassay precision) for CTC detection and
enumeration (26) and has been previously demonstrated to
detect a wide range of CTC phenotypes (32, 33, 40, 43). These
include rare CTCs that are negative for epithelial markers with
malignant genomics (40, 43) and CTCs that are smaller than
WBCs (32, 43).

 The approach used to analyze the digital pathology features
represents a novel confluence of techniques adapted from diverse
fields. The z-score transformation and principal component anal-
ysis is used in gene array applications to avoid redundancy and
distill distinct sources of variance within the data (44). K-means
clustering (45) is a machine learning technique with applications
including, but not limited to, e-commerce, defense, ecology, and
astronomy (46). Shannon index is a measure of species diversity
frequently utilized in ecology research (47), where quantification
and monitoring of species biodiversity and evolutionary events is
common. Shannon index increases with both the number of
unique species present and the evenness in species distribution.
When applied to CTCs, it indicates the level of uncertainty to
predict what phenotypic subtypes of CTCs are going to be detected
next: the higher the uncertainty (entropy), the higher the hetero-
geneity. We additionally developed a simpler, alternate measure
of CTC phenotypic heterogeneity within patient samples that
does not require unsupervised clustering, the Pleomorphism
Index (see Supplementary Methods; Supplementary Fig. S5A and
S5B), performed identical survival analyses, and observed similar
results with respect to phenotypic heterogeneity, drug class
administered, and OS (Supplementary Fig. S6A–S6E). These
results suggest that there are likely multiple ways to model
heterogeneity, but the underlying phenomena observed is con-
sistent with our central hypothesis.
A limitation of this approach is the potential lack of utility in
the setting of low or no CTC counts. Recognizing this, as stated in
Patients and Methods, our focus was the second or later line of
therapy setting where the frequency of detection and individual
CTC counts are higher, and the decision to select one form of
therapy versus another is more critical. In our analyses, samples
with 1 or 0 CTCs were assigned a heterogeneity score of 0 and
included in our OS association analyses. However, despite these
potential shortcomings, Shannon index does demonstrate the
ability to differentially predict OS by therapy class, even when
total CTC count is included as a covariate in multivariate models.
A supplemental sub-cohort analysis that excluded samples with
heterogeneity scores of 0 yielded similar results as well (Supple-
mentary Fig. S4A and S4B). Ultimately, it may be concluded that
the determination of a heterogeneity score (for which there is
currently no unified definition, units, or reference range deter-
mined by the field; ref. 42) might have a requisite minimal
number of CTCs for optimal quantification.
Another emerging technique that can infer heterogeneity on the
genomic level is cell-free DNA (cfDNA; ref. 48). cfDNA is several
steps removed from the cells of origin and represents a homog-
enized mixture, or pool, of tumor DNA and nontumor DNA from
multiple cells, which poses additional technical hurdles when
trying to distill features of entropy or variance within a patient
sample. cfDNA can also include fragments of apoptotic or dead
cells that could represent parts of tumor that were sensitive to the
treatment and consequently eliminated (49). In part due to these
reasons, we excluded the analysis of apoptotic CTCs and only
scored intact, whole CTCs.
In addition to clinical utility, the abilities to provide results in
time to inform clinical decisions and at a reasonable cost are
essential for the use of a biomarker in clinical practice. Image-
based phenotypic measures of tumor heterogeneity meet this
requirement. Previously, our group analytically validated a sin-
gle-CTC whole genome sequencing technology (39) to potential-
ly assess intrapatient genomic heterogeneity. While promising,
this approach is not scalable with available sequencing technol-
ogies when considering reproducibility, turnaround time, and
cost. Acknowledging these caveats, we performed whole-genome
sequencing on CTCs from a subset of samples with at least 10
evaluable CTCs. The results showed frequent subclonal altera-
tions associated with ARSI resistance (Fig. 6C), consistent with the
poor outcome of patients on ARSI who had high phenotypic
heterogeneity determined with the Shannon index reported here-
in (Fig. 5). A greatly expanded cohort of single-cell sequencing
results would be required for meaningful statistical analyses of
genomic heterogeneity. However, these data suggest that samples
with high phenotypic heterogeneity have heterogeneous genomic
profiles as well.
In previous work, we studied an analytically validated IHC
assay for AR-V7 as a treatment-selection biomarker for the same
context (50), and found that 100% of patients with nuclear-
localized AR-V7 protein in their CTCs had poor responses on
ARSI and lived longer on taxanes (50). The assay, however, did not
identify all patients who would have poor response on ARSI, as
the frequency of AR-V7 detection was only 20% among patients
who had less than 50% PSA decline by 12 weeks. Thus, most of the
patients who did not respond to ARSI were AR-V7–negative. In the
current study, patients with an increasing Shannon index had an
increasing risk of death on ARSI relative to taxanes (Fig. 5). This
suggests that patients with low heterogeneity scores would be
more likely to survive longer on an ARSI over a taxane, and
patients with high heterogeneity scores would likely survive
longer on a taxane than an ARSI. Specifically in the context of
AR-V7–negative patients, this measure could have the potential to
more reliably inform treatment selection at this clinical decision
point. Comparisons of AR-V7 to heterogeneity indices are
planned for future studies.
CTC heterogeneity biomarkers may also be useful in the clinical
development of novel therapies, as many trials evaluate cohorts of
heavily pretreated patients who might exhibit high levels of
heterogeneity that could portend resistance to targeted therapeu-
tics. Such patients may be more suitably offered participation in
studies of novel drug combinations, or combinations that include
a cytotoxic drug more likely to affect diverse cell populations.
While the results reported here have the potential for broad
implications, this study was designed to test a hypothesis that
represents a first step in the clinical evaluation of an analytically
valid, quantitative measurement of heterogeneity that could serve
as a therapy-guiding biomarker to inform the choice between an
ARSI or taxane for mCRPC patients starting a second- or later line
therapy. The gold standard for evaluating the clinical utility of a
predictive biomarker is through randomized, interventional
trials. A limitation of observational studies like this one is the
possibility of unobserved confounding factors. An additional
limitation of our study is the lack of an external validation cohort.
Definitive clinical utility of these heterogeneity biomarkers will
require a sequence of trials, analogous to the development of a
drug focused on a context of use. Further clinical validation in
separate, larger cohorts is planned and assessment of longitudinal
and kinetic changes over time in response to therapy are ongoing,
both within the context of mCRPC clinical decisions and outside
of prostate cancer.
