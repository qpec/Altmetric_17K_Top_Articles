Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne enveloped virus belonging 
to the Flavivirus genus in the family Flaviviridae, which also includes 
the human pathogenic yellow fever, dengue, West Nile and tick-borne 
encephalitis viruses1. Flaviviruses have two structural glycoproteins, 
prM and E (for precursor membrane and envelope proteins, respec-
tively), which form a heterodimer in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
of the infected cell and drive the budding of spiky immature virions 
into the ER lumen. These particles transit through the cellular secretory 
pathway, during which the trans-Golgi-resident protease furin cleaves 
prM. This processing is required for infectivity, and results in the loss of 
a large fragment of prM and reorganization of E on the virion surface. 
The mature particles have a smooth aspect, with 90 E dimers organized 
with icosahedral symmetry in a ‘herringbone’ pattern2,3.
Three-dimensional cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) struc-
tures of the mature ZIKV particles have recently been reported to near 
atomic resolution (3.8 Å)4,5, showing that the virus has essentially the 
same organization as the other flaviviruses of known structure, such as 
dengue virus (DENV)3 and West Nile virus6,7. The E protein is about 
500 amino acids long, with the 400 N-terminal residues forming the 
ectodomain essentially folded as β-sheets with three domains, named I, 
II and III, aligned in a row with domain I at the centre. The conserved 
fusion loop is at the distal end of the rod in domain II, buried at the 
E dimer interface. At the C terminus, the E ectodomain is followed 
by the ‘stem’
, featuring two α-helices lying flat on the viral membrane 
(the stem helices), which link to two C-terminal transmembrane 
 
α-helices. The main distinguishing feature of the ZIKV virion is an 
insertion within a glycosylated loop of E (the ‘150’ loop), which pro-
trudes from the mature virion surface4,5.
Flaviviruses have been grouped into serocomplexes based on 
cross-neutralization studies with polyclonal immune sera8. The 
 
E protein is the main target of neutralizing antibodies, and is also the 
viral fusogen; cleavage of prM allows E to respond to the endosomal 
pH by undergoing a large-scale conformational change that catalyses 
membrane fusion and releases the viral genome into the cyotosol. Loss 
of the precursor fragment of prM lets the E protein fluctuate from its 
tight packing at the surface of the virion, transiently exposing otherwise 
buried surfaces. One surface exposed by this ‘breathing’ is the fusion-
loop epitope (FLE), which is a dominant cross-reactive antigenic site9. 
Although antibodies to this site can protect by complement-mediated 
mechanisms, as shown in a mouse model for West Nile virus10, they are 
poorly neutralizing and lead to antibody-dependent enhancement11–15, 
thereby aggravating Flavivirus pathogenesis and complicating the 
development of safe and effective vaccines.
We recently reported the functional and structural characterization 
of a panel of antibodies isolated from patients with dengue disease13,16. 
Most of these antibodies target the FLE, but others target a quaternary 
site readily accessible at the exposed surface of the E protein on the 
virion, at the interface between the two E subunits in the dimer. These 
broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), termed EDE for E-dimer 
epitope, potently neutralize all four DENV serotypes. Their binding 
site is conserved across serotypes because it is also the interaction site 
of prM with E dimers during transport of the immature virus  
particles 
through the Golgi apparatus of the cell. There were two  
subsets of 
EDE antibodies, characterized by a differential requirement for 
 
glycosylation on the 150 loop for binding. The EDE1 bnAbs bind 
 
better in the absence of glycan, whereas EDE2 bnAbs bind better when 
the glycan is present.
In this study, we show that the EDE bnAbs neutralize ZIKV as 
potently as they neutralize DENV
. We also find that the FLE antibodies, 
which neutralize DENV although not as potently as the EDE bnAbs, 
do not neutralize ZIKV at concentrations up to 1 μM in spite of a high 
affinity for the recombinant ZIKV E protein. We further describe the 
Zika virus is a member of the Flavivirus genus that had not been associated with severe disease in humans until the recent 
outbreaks, when it was linked to microcephaly in newborns in Brazil and to Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults in French 
Polynesia. Zika virus is related to dengue virus, and here we report that a subset of antibodies targeting a conformational 
epitope isolated from patients with dengue virus also potently neutralize Zika virus. The crystal structure of two of these 
antibodies in complex with the envelope protein of Zika virus reveals the details of a conserved epitope, which is also the 
site of interaction of the envelope protein dimer with the precursor membrane (prM) protein during virus maturation. 
Comparison of the Zika and dengue virus immunocomplexes provides a lead for rational, epitope-focused design of a 
universal vaccine capable of eliciting potent cross-neutralizing antibodies to protect simultaneously against both Zika 
and dengue virus infections.

crystal structures of the ZIKV E protein dimer alone and in complex 
with EDE1 C8 and EDE2 A11, identifying their binding determinants.
A ZIKV–DENV super serogroup
Phylogenetic analyses of the main human pathogenic flaviviruses using 
the amino acid sequences of the viral RNA polymerase NS5 indicate 
a clustering of ZIKV with the group of mosquito-borne encephalitic 
viruses. The clustering is different when the amino acid sequences of 
the E protein are considered, with ZIKV branching with the DENV 
group (Fig. 1a). If the sequence clustering extends to the antigenic 
surface of E, antibodies that cross-react with several DENV serotypes 
should also bind ZIKV E. To test this hypothesis, we used biolayer 
interferometry to study the binding properties of a poorly neutraliz-
ing, cross-reactive FLE antibody and the potently neutralizing EDE 
antibodies for recombinant, soluble ZIKV E ectodomain (ZIKV sE) 
produced in insect cells (see Methods). The FLE antibody (P6B10) 
bound nearly 10-fold more tightly than did EDE1 C8 (apparent disso-
ciation constant (Kd) values of 1.5 nM versus 9 nM), and nearly 1,000 
times more tightly than EDE2 A11 (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a). 
Consistent with their affinities, we could isolate a complex of ZIKV sE 
with a C8 Fab by size-exclusion chromatography, but not with an A11 
Fab (Extended Data Fig. 1b).
Neutralization assays in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells 
using these and other members of the three antibody subsets, showed 
that the EDE1 antibodies strongly neutralize ZIKV, whereas the EDE2 
antibodies were at least one log order less potent. Despite its strong 
affinity, P6B10 did not neutralize ZIKV in the concentration range 
used, nor did either of the two other FLE antibodies tested (Fig. 2). 
The EDE1 bnAbs neutralized best the ZIKV African strain HD78788, 
with a half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) of about 0.1 nM. 
This strain has over the years been cell-culture-adapted and passaged 
in suckling mice brain and lacks E glycosylation. The IC50 against the 
PF13 strain, isolated in French Polynesia in 2013 and in which the 
 
E protein is glycosylated at position 154, was in the nanomolar range 
and comparable to, or lower than, that against the four DENV serotypes 
(Table 1). The EDE2 bnAbs showed no difference in neutralization of 
the two strains, suggesting that the presence of the N154 glycan in the 
ZIKV E protein did not enhance the interaction.
The ZIKV–EDE bnAbs immune complexes
We crystallized unliganded ZIKV sE and complexes of ZIKV sE with 
EDE1 C8 and EDE2 A11 with single-chain Fv (scFv) and Fab frag-
ments, respectively (Extended Data Table 1). In the structure of unli-
ganded ZIKV sE, the 150 loop is ordered, unlike the unglycosylated 150 
loop in the recently determined structure of the protein produced in 
bacteria and refolded in vitro17. In contrast to our insect-cell-secreted 
protein, which is a dimer (Extended Data Fig. 1b), the refolded protein 
was reported to be monomeric in solution, suggesting that the glycan 
may help to structure the loop and promote sE dimerization.
The antibodies recognize a quaternary epitope in the ZIKV sE dimer 
in the same way that they recognize the DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) 
sE dimer described earlier16. The amino acid residues participating in 
the contacts, for both the ZIKV and DENV-2 structures, are shown in 
Extended Data Fig. 2. As expected, the pattern is very similar, with the 
few differences highlighted in red frames in Extended Data Fig. 2b. 
Both epitopes in the sE dimer are occupied in the case of the complex 
with C8 (Fig. 3a), whereas only one is occupied in the case of A11 
 
(Fig. 4a). Inspection of the crystal environment showed that a second 
Fab could not be docked at this position without clashing with neigh-
bouring complexes in the crystal. This observation indicates that crystal 
growth selected for incorporation of sE dimers with a single Fab bound, 
which is facilitated by the low affinity of A11.
The bnAbs dock on ZIKV sE at different angles than they do on 
DENV-2 sE (see insets in Figs 3a and 4a). In the case of the C8 complex,

the difference in docking results mainly from an altered curvature of 
the sE dimer. We note that the conformation of ZIKV sE in complex 
with the antibodies is very similar to the one it adopts on the virus 
particle, with roughly 1.5 Å root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) for 
790 Cα atoms (see Extended Data Table 2). The unbound ZIKV sE 
crystallized here displays a more distant conformation (2.5 Å r.m.s.d. 
when comparing to both virion ZIKV E and either of the sE antibody 
complexes), suggesting that the antibodies stabilize a conformation 
close to that on the viral particle. By contrast, the same comparisons 
done for DENV-2 sE, alone or in complex with the bnAbs, result in 
r.m.s.d. values of 5–7 Å with respect to the E conformation on the 
DENV virion observed by cryo-EM3. For comparison, superposition of 
the ectodomain of virion E from ZIKV5 and DENV-2 (ref. 3) results in 
a similar 1.5 Å r.m.s.d. value, indicating that they are presented roughly 
in the same way, but that DENV sE is more deformable in solution. 
This malleability may reflect the conformational breathing reported 
for DENV E18. Instead, ZIKV sE remains in a similar conformation in 
the absence of the interactions with the underlying stem α-helices and 
with the M protein (the membrane-anchored remnant of prM after 
furin cleavage) on the virion, in line with the higher stability of the 
ZIKV particles described recently4.
EDE1 C8 complex
The total buried surface area of EDE1 C8 in the complex with ZIKV 
sE is about 900 Å2, compared to about 1,300 Å2 in the DENV-2 sE 
complex (Extended Data Table 3). Figure 3d shows the conserva-
tion of the epitope, and Fig. 3e and f compare the C8 footprint on 
ZIKV and DENV-2 sE. The DENV-specific glycan at position N67, 
which is ordered in the DENV-2 sE structure (Fig. 3c), accounts for 
around two-thirds of the overall difference in footprint area. The 
N67 glycan interacts with the framework region 2 of the heavy chain 
(FRH2), and its absence in ZIKV sE shows that these contacts are 
not essential for binding. The key cluster of interactions that is main-
tained is centred on β-strand b of domain II, with side chains from 
 
complementarity determining regions (CDRs) H2, H3 and L3 
 
recognizing all the available hydrogen bond donors (main-chain 
 
carbonyls) and acceptors (main-chain carbonyls) of the bdc β-sheet 
edge (Fig. 3b, c). In addition, the fusion loop main chain (which 
contains several glycine residues) and the disulfide bond between 
Cys74 and Cys105 are framed by aromatic side chains of the CDRs 
L1 and L3 (see also Extended Data Fig. 3). Residues from these two 
CDRs also recognize strictly conserved side chains of the fusion loop 
(Arg99) or nearby residues (Gln77).
Across the dimer interface, and as in the complex with DENV-2, the 
150 loop is partially disordered, with no detectable density for the N154 
glycan (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 3d). As shown in Extended Data 
Fig. 3, the interacting residues across the dimer interface are different, 
reflecting the more limited sequence conservation in these regions of the 
E protein: in the DENV-2 sE complex, these contacts are with residues 
from β-strands A and B of domain III, but in ZIKV they mainly involve 
Lys373 from β-strand E interacting with CDRs L1 and L2, via a network 
of direct or water-mediated hydrogen bonds (Extended Data Fig. 3b, c). 
 
Similarly, several charged residues in domain I and from the nearby 
 
kl loop of domain II across the interface, contribute to the binding 
and interact with the heavy chain CDRs H2 and H3 (Extended Data 
 
Fig. 3e, f). All of the polar interactions between C8 and ZIKV sE are 
listed in Extended Data Tables 4 and 5, and the electrostatic surface 
of the epitope is shown in Extended Data Fig. 4, left panel. In sum-
mary, these observations identify the conserved cluster of contacts with 
the b strand and the fusion loop in domain II as the main binding 
determinants of C8, with additional contacts from across the dimer 
 
interface—or from the N67 glycan in DENV—further stabilizing but 
not determining the interaction.
EDE2 A11 complex
Extended Data Fig. 4 compares the footprint of C8 and A11 on ZIKV 
sE, together with the surface electrostatic potential of the complexes, 
which shows a strong basic patch on sE in the C8 complex due to

the disorder of the 150 loop. As shown in Extended Data Fig. 5, C8 
would clash with the glycan had the loop remained in place, as was the 
case in the complex with DENV-2 sE16. In the A11 complex, the 150 
loop remains in the same conformation as in the cryo-EM structures 
of the virion (Extended Data Fig. 5a) and in the X-ray structure of 
glycosylated unliganded sE reported here. In the DENV-2 sE–A11 
complex, the glycan is recognized by an α-helix in the long CDR 
H3 loop (Fig. 4e). The difference in length in the 150 loop of E in 
ZIKV compared to DENV shifts the glycan position by about 6–7 Å, 
such that it cannot make the same interactions with the CDR H3 
α-helix (Fig. 4d, e and Extended Data Fig. 5b). As a consequence, 
the A11 antibody docks at a different angle on ZIKV sE than it does 
on DENV-2 sE, even accounting for the difference in sE dimer cur-
vature (Fig. 4a, inset). The contacts along the b strand are preserved 
 
(Fig. 4b, c). Compared to C8, the b strand is recognized only along 
half its length (residues 71 and 73), whereas C8 recognizes it all along, 
from residue 68 (or from 67 in DENV).
Discussion
Our results identify the structural details of a quaternary epitope that 
provides a previously unrecognized link of potent cross-neutralization 
 
between Zika and dengue viruses, and thus identifies an antigenic 
Flavivirus cluster beyond the traditional serocomplexes. This rela-
tionship defines a super serogroup on the basis of strong cross- 
neutralization through a conserved epitope that had not been recognized 
 
using polyclonal sera8. This finding thus introduces the possibility of 
developing a universal vaccine protecting against all the viruses from 
this group.
Vaccine design against dengue virus has been hampered by the het-
erogeneity of DENV particles and the need to use polyvalent formulas 
to immunize against all four serotypes19,20. One feature of DENV is that 
it undergoes incomplete furin maturation cleavage of prM in many cell 
types, giving rise to heterogeneous mosaic particles with an immature- 
like spiky patch on one side and a smooth mature-like region on the 
opposite side21. These particles are infectious, as they can fuse with

Figure 3 | EDE1 C8–ZIKV sE complex. a, Overall view of the complex, 
with the sE moiety coloured by domains (I, II and III in red, yellow and 
blue, respectively); the antibodies in grey and dark green for light and 
heavy chains, respectively. The CDRs are coloured (H1, light blue; H2, 
sand; H3, pink; L1, light grey; L2, magenta; L3, orange). The inset shows 
a comparison with the corresponding DENV-2 complex. For clarity, the 
variable region of the C8 Fab fragment of the DENV-2 sE–C8 complex 
was superposed on the C8 scFv in complex with ZIKV sE to draw the Fab 
axes and show the docking angles better. b, Zoom of the ZIKV sE–C8 
interaction to show the recognition of the b strand. Hydrogen bonds are 
shown as dotted lines and immobilized water molecules as red spheres. 
c, Same region on the DENV-2 sE–C8 Fab complex. Note that the N67 
glycan on DENV also interacts with the antibody. d, The footprint of EDE1 
C8 is outlined on the ZIKV sE dimer shown in surface representation 
(looking from outside the virion) coloured according to conservation of 
surface-exposed amino acids. Atoms from the main-chain and conserved 
side chains are orange, highly similar side chains are yellow, and all the 
others are white. e, f, Footprints of EDE1 C8 on a surface representation of 
ZIKV sE (e) and DENV-2 sE (f) shown in purple. FL, fusion loop. The two 
protomers of sE in the dimer are in light and dark grey. Relevant antigenic 
sE regions are labelled. Note the more confined interacting surface in the 
ZIKV sE dimer than in DENV-2, for example, N67 glycan is absent in 
ZIKV sE.

the cellular membrane through the smooth, mature side. Because the 
FLE is exposed in immature regions22, most of the antibody response 
in DENV-infected patients is directed against it23. These cross-reactive 
 
antibodies coat the particles on the immature side22 but neutralize 
only weakly, because they can bind the mature side only when the 
 
E protein ‘breathes’24–26. A recently published structure of monomeric 
ZIKV sE in complex with an FLE-specific monoclonal mouse antibody 
of low neutralizing activity indeed shows that its binding site would 
be occluded in the dimeric E protein on mature infectious virions17. 
The observation that P6B10 and other FLE antibodies still neutralize 
DENV13 suggests that E in the mature patches on DENV spends more 
time in conformations that expose the FLE than does E in those patches 
on ZIKV. This inference is consistent with the higher thermal stability 
of ZIKV reported recently4.
Our results suggest that the epitope targeted by the EDE1 bnAbs 
is better suited for developing an epitope-focused vaccine for viruses 
in the ZIKV/DENV super serogroup than is the FLE, which induces 
poorly neutralizing and strongly infection-enhancing antibodies12–14. 
The EDE1 is also better suited than the related EDE2 epitope: although 
the EDE1 bnAbs require an E dimer to bind, the actual binding 
 
determinants are centred on the b strand and on the highly con-
served, E-dimer-exposed elements of the fusion loop, as shown by 
the comparison between their binding to DENV-2 and ZIKV sE. 
The fact that EDE2 bnAbs rely heavily on their contact points on the 
adjacent subunit—on the variable 150 loop in which glycosylation 
is not always present—is a drawback, as demonstrated by their poor 
affinity (Fig. 1) and their strong induction of antibody-dependent 
 
enhancement12.
Targeting the b strand and the E-dimer-exposed elements of the 
fusion loop appears as a powerful alternative to the multi-immunogen 
approaches against the DENV cluster that have had limited success in 
clinical trials27. As the E protein polypeptide chain displays neither 
insertions nor deletions in the region of the b strand for any medically 
relevant Flavivirus, this region presents a low risk of inducing escape 
mutations, most likely because it is also the interacting site with prM 
during virus maturation. Finally, in a more immediate application, 
our study also suggests that the EDE1 antibodies, perhaps carrying 
the ‘LALA
’ mutation28 if effector functions are to be avoided, could be 
useful for immune prophylaxis for pregnant women at risk of contract-
ing ZIKV infection.

in the DENV-2 structure (see Extended Data Figs 2b and 5b).

METHODS
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments 
were not randomized, and investigators were not blinded to allocation during 
experiments and outcome assessment.
Recombinant production of ZIKV sE protein. Recombinant Zika virus sE pro-
tein (strain H/PF/2013, GenBank accession number KJ776791) was produced 
with a tandem strep-tag in the Drosophila Expression System (Invitrogen) as 
described previously29,30. A chemically synthesized DNA fragment (GeneArt) 
containing the Zika sE sequence (amino acids 1–408) was cloned into the 
expression vector pT389 (ref. 31) that encodes the export signal sequence BIP, 
an enterokinase cleavage site and the strep-tag. Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells 
were stably transfected using blasticidin for selection. Protein expression was 
induced by the addition of CuSO4 and supernatants were collected 7–10 days after 
induction. Antigens were purified via affinity chromatography with Streptactin 
columns (IBA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A final purification 
gel filtration step used a Superdex increase 200 10/300 GL column equilibrated 
in 50 mM Tris, pH 8, 500 mM NaCl.
Production of antigen-binding (Fab) and scFv fragments of the bnAbs. The 
bnAb fragments were cloned into plasmids for expression as Fab32 and scFv33 
in Drosophila S2 cells. The constructs contain a tandem strep-tag fused at the 
 
C terminus (only of the heavy chain in the case of the Fab) for affinity purification. 
The purification protocol included a Streptactin affinity column followed by gel 
filtration as described above.
Expression of human monoclonal anti-DENV E antibodies. Full IgG antibodies 
were produced in 293T cells (a gift from C. Lee), which were free from mycoplasma 
contamination tested by Lookout Mycoplasma PCR detection kit (Sigma MP0035). 
These cells were co-transfected with plasmids containing heavy and light chains 
of immunoglobulin G1 as described previously13.
Immune complex formation and isolation. The purified ZIKV sE protein was 
mixed with Fab A11 or scFv C8 (in approximately twofold molar excess) in stand-
ard buffer (500 mM NaCl, Tris 50 mM, pH 8.0). The volume was brought to 0.5 ml 
by centrifugation in a Vivaspin 10 kDa cut-off; after a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, 
the complex was separated from excess Fab or scFv by size-exclusion chromatog-
raphy for ZIKV sE and scFv C8. For ZIKV sE and Fab A11, no apparent complex 
formation could be seen in size-exclusion chromatography; therefore a solution 
containing sE at a concentration of 1.5 mg ml−1 and Fab A11 at a concentration 
of 3 mg ml−1 (corresponding to a molar ratio ~1:2 antigen:antibody) was directly 
used for crystallization. In all cases, the buffer was exchanged to 150 mM NaCl, 
15 mM Tris, pH 8, for crystallization trials. The protein concentrations used for 
crystallization, determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and using 
an extinction coefficient estimated from the amino acid sequences, are listed in 
Extended Data Table 1.
Real-time biolayer interferometry binding assays. The interactions of purified 
ZIKV E protein with IgG FLE P6B10, IgG EDE1 C8, IgG EDE2 A11, and control 
IgG 28C (an anti-influenza virus) were monitored in real-time using a bio-layer 
interferometry Octet-Red384 device (Pall ForteBio). Anti-human IgG Fc cap-
ture biosensors (Pall ForteBio) were loaded for 10 min at 1,000 r.p.m. shaking 
speed using antibodies at 5 μg ml−1 in assay buffer (PBS plus 0.2 mg ml−1 BSA 
and tween 0.01%). Unbound antibodies were washed away for 1 min in assay 
buffer. IgG-loaded sensors were then incubated for 15 min at 1,200 r.p.m. in the 
absence and presence of twofold serially diluted ZIKV sE protein concentra-
tions in assay buffer. Molar concentrations were calculated for the sE protein 
in a dimeric form. For the antibodies FLE P6B10, EDE1 C8 and EDE2 A11, 
the following ZIKV sE concentration ranges: 0.78–50 nM, 3.125–200 nM and 
50–3,200 nM, were respectively used. Reference binding experiments were car-
ried out in parallel on sensors loaded with control IgG 28C. Dissociation of the 
complexes formed was then monitored for 10 min by dipping sensors in assay 
buffer alone. Operating temperature was maintained at 25 °C. The real-time 
data were analysed using Scrubber 2.0 (Biologic Software) and Biaevaluation 4.1 
(GE Healthcare). Specific signals were obtained by double-referencing, that is, 
subtracting non-specific signals measured on non-specific IgG-loaded sensors 
and buffer signals on specific IgG-loaded sensors. Association and dissociation 
profiles, as well as steady-state signal versus concentration curves, were fitted 
assuming a 1:1 binding model.
Crystallization and X-ray structure determinations. The crystallization 
 
and cryo-cooling conditions for diffraction data collection are listed in Extended 
Data Table 1. Crystallization trials were performed in sitting drops of 400 nl. 
Drops were formed by mixing equal volumes of the protein and reservoir solution 
in 96-well Greiner plates, using a Mosquito robot and monitored by a Rock-
Imager. Crystals were optimized using a robotized Matrix Maker and Mosquito 
setups on 400 nl sitting or hanging drops, or manually in 24-well plates using 
2–3 μl hanging drops.
Because of the strong anisotropy of the crystals (see results for anisotropy in 
Extended Data Table 1), an important number of crystals was tested at several beam 
lines at different synchrotrons (SOLEIL, St Aubin, France; ESRF, Grenoble, France; 
SLS, Villigen, Switzerland). The crystals having the less anisotropic diffraction data 
were used to determine the structures. The data sets were indexed, integrated, 
scaled and merged using XDS34 and AIMLESS35. A preliminary model of ZIKV 
sE protein was built from the DENV-2 sE (4UTA) structure using the structure 
homology-modelling server SWISS-MODEL36. The structures of the complexes 
were then determined by molecular replacement with PHASER37 using the search 
models listed in Extended Data Table 1. AIMLESS and PHASER programs were 
used within the CCP4 suite38.
The DEBYE and STARANISO programs developed by Global Phasing Ltd were 
applied to the data scaled with AIMLESS without applying a resolution limit, using 
the STARANISO server (http://staraniso.globalphasing.org/). These programs 
perform an anisotropic cut-off of merged intensity data on the basis of an analysis 
of local I/σ(I), compute Bayesian estimates of structure amplitudes, taking into 
account their anisotropic fall-off, and apply an anisotropic correction to the data. 
These corrected anisotropic amplitudes were then used for further refinement of 
the structures with BUSTER/TNT39. Please note that the Extended Data Table 1 
shows the refinement statistics against the full sets of reflections truncated at the 
best high-resolution along the h, k or l axis.
The models were then alternatively manually corrected and completed using 
COOT40 and refined using BUSTER/TNT against the amplitudes corrected for 
anisotropy. Refinements were constrained using non-crystallographic symmetry. 
The refined structures have the following final Rwork/Rfree (in %) values: ZIKV sE–
EDE1 C8 scFv (19.5/22.1), ZIKV sE–EDE2 A11 Fab (22.3/23.7) and unliganded 
ZIKV sE (20.8/23.6) (see Extended Data Table 1).
Analysis of the atomic models and illustrations. Each complex was analysed with 
the CCP4 suite of programs and the polar contacts were computed with the PISA 
website41. For the intermolecular interactions shown in Extended Data Figs 2 and 3 
 
and Extended Data Tables 4 and 5, the maximal cut-off distances used were 4 Å 
and 4.75 Å for polar and van der Waals contacts, respectively. Multiple sequence 
alignments were calculated using Clustal W and Clustal X version 2 (ref. 42) on 
the EBI server43. The figures illustrating the structural models were prepared 
using ESPript44 and the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, version 1.5.0.4 
(Schrödinger) (http://pymol.sourceforge.net).
Phylogenic trees. The maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were inferred using 
12 representative amino acid sequences of Flavivirus envelope protein E or RNA 
polymerase NS5 proteins, using the LG model available in PhyML45 and a combi-
nation of SPR+NNI branch-swapping. Bootstrap values were calculated from 100 
bootstrap replicates. The trees were visualized using Figtree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.
uk/software/figtree/). The accession codes of sequences used in the tree: Zika virus 
(ZIKV, KJ776791, strain H-PF-2013_French_Polynesia); dengue virus serotype 1 
(DENV-1, NC_001477); dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2, NC_001474); dengue 
 
virus serotype 3 (DENV-3, NC_001475); dengue virus serotype 4 (DENV-4, 
 
NC_002640); Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV, NC_007580); Japanese 
encephalitis virus (JEV, NC_001437; Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV, 
NC_000943); West Nile virus (WNV, NC_001563); yellow fever virus (YFV, 
NC_002031); tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV, NC_001672); and Powassan 
virus (POWV, NC_003687).
Viral stocks. The African strain Zika HD78788 was obtained from the Institut 
Pasteur collection and the Asian strain Zika PF13, isolated from a patient during 
ZIKV outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013, was obtained through the DENFREE 
(FP7/2007-2013) consortium. Viral stocks were prepared from supernatant of 
infected C6/36 cells (ATCC CRL-1660) clarified by centrifugation at 3,000g at 4 °C 
and titrated on Vero cells (ATCC CRL-1586) by a focus-forming assay. Stocks were 
kept at −80 °C until use. All cell lines were free from mycoplasma contamination.
Neutralization assays. Virus neutralization by the tested human antibodies 
was evaluated using a focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT). About 100 
focus-forming units from virus stocks were incubated with a serial dilution of 
 
antibody for 1 h at 37 °C. The mixture was then added to Vero cells and foci were 
left to develop in presence of 1.5% methylcellulose for 2 days. Foci were then stained 
after fixation with 4% formaldehyde using anti-E 4G2 antibody (ATCC HB-112) 
and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody

Extended Data Figure 2 | Residues involved in bnAb–antigen 
interactions. a, Antibody contacts on the amino acid sequence alignment 
of ZIKV and DENV-2 sE. A red background highlights identical 
residues. Secondary structure elements are indicated together with their 
labels above (ZIKV) and below (DENV-2) the sequences. The domain 
organization of ZIKV and DENV-2 sE is symbolized by a coloured bar 
above the sequences (domain I red, domain II yellow, domain III blue 
and the fusion loop orange). Residues involved in polar and van der 
Waals protein–protein contacts are marked using blue and green symbols, 
respectively, as indicated in the inset key, displayed above and below 
the alignment for ZIKV and DENV-2 sE, respectively. Full and empty 
symbols correspond to antibody contacts on the reference subunit of sE 
(defined as the one contributing the fusion loop to the epitope) and the 
opposite subunit of sE, respectively. Residues contacted only by the heavy 
or light chain are marked with squares or triangles, respectively, and those 
contacted by both antibody chains with circles. Dots above the sequences 
mark every 10 residues on the ZIKV sE sequence. Disulfide bridges are 
numbered in green above the sequences. b, Amino acid sequence of the 
heavy and light chains variable domains (vH and vL) of bnAbs EDE1 C8 
(top) and EDE2 A11 (bottom) with the framework (FRW) indicated by 
black bars and IMGT CDR regions by thin dashed lines. The secondary 
structure elements of the Ig vH and vL β-barrels are indicated above 
the sequences. Somatic mutations are in red and residues arising from 
recombination at the V-D-J junction are in green. Symbols above and 
below the sequences mark residues involved in contacts with ZIKV and 
DENV-2 sE, respectively, coded for the contacted site in sE as indicated 
in the key (inset at the bottom). Polar and van der Waals contacts are 
shown in blue and green, respectively. The antibody residues contacting 
the reference sE subunit (defined as the one contributing the fusion loop 
to the epitope) are marked by plain colour symbols while those making 
contact across the dimer interface by empty coloured symbols. Red boxes 
highlight the contacts found in the DENV-2 sE complex and absent in the 
ZIKV sE complex, involving N67 glycan, kl and 150 loops. The details of 
the polar contacts are listed in the Extended Data Tables 4 and 5 (see also 
Fig. 3e, f). The predicted vH and vL germline alleles are indicated with the 
corresponding CDR lengths (see Table 1 in ref. 16).

chain with the antibody. Domain II from the subunit across is coloured 
green to distinguish from domain II of the reference subunit; the dashed 
sticks for the arginine residue indicate that it has poor electron density 
in the crystal. f, Same view of the complex with DENV-2. Note that the 
residues from across the dimer interface that contact the antibody are 
different. The residues in the various CDRs are coloured coded, matching 
their label colour (as in Figs 3 and 4).

potential is coloured according to the bar underneath. The antibody 
footprints are outlined in green. The disordered 150 loop in the complex

Extended Data Figure 5 | Details of the A11 interaction with the 
glycan on the 150 loop. a, Superposition of the ZIKV sE–A11 complex 
(in colours) on the E protein from the cryo-EM structure of the mature 
virion (ref. 5) (PDB code 5IRE) in white. The E protein was superimposed 
on the tip of domain II of the reference subunit together with domain III 
from the opposite subunit. It shows that the 150 loop adopts essentially 
the same conformation, although fewer sugar residues are visible in the 
absence of the antibody. b, Superposition of the ZIKV sE–A11 complex 
(in colours) on the DENV-2 sE–A11 complex (in white). The variable 
domains of the antibody from the two structures were superimposed on 
each other. Note that in DENV-2 the glycan packs against the α-helix of 
the CDR H3, whereas in ZIKV sE the glycan is too far to make the same 
interaction. c, The ZIKV sE–C8 complex (in pink) was superimposed on 
the ZIKV sE–A11 complex (in colours), to show the clash of the C8 light 
chain with the glycan, forcing it to move out of the way and be disordered. 
The superposition also shows that EDE1 C8 reaches further in to contact 
the ij loop and the kl loop of the adjacent subunit, as well as domain III. As 
in a, the superposition was done using the tip of domain II of the reference 
subunit and domain III of the adjacent subunit in the dimer as anchors. 
The two black asterisks mark the places where the electron density of the 
150 loop is lost, resulting in no density in the ZIKV sE–C8 crystal for the 
short helix, nor for the glycan.

Extended Data Table 1 | Crystallization conditions, data collection and refinement statistics
The ZIKV sE buffer used for all crystallization experiments was: 150 
mM NaCl, 15 
mM Tris, pH 8.
*The protein concentration was estimated using theoretical extinction coefficients of the complexes (ZIKV sE + Fab or scFv). Absorbance at 280 
nm (A280 nm) of the protein solution was measured 
before crystallization. The theoretical extinction coefficients for individual component are: ZIKV sE: 1.345; bnAb EDE2 A11 Fab: 1.68 (see Methods for more details); bnAb EDE1 C8 scFv: 1.9. Extinction 
coefficients were calculated without taking carbohydrate moieties into account. One crystal was used to collect a diffraction data set for each complex to determine the structure.
†The anisotropy statistics were computed with AIMLESS.
‡Highest resolution shell is shown in parentheses.
§Low-resolution for data processing and refinements was truncated to 40 
Å.
||Ramachandran statistics were calculated with MolProbity.
