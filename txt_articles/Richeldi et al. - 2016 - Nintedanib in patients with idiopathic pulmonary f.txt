Background and purpose: The Phase II TOMORROW trial and two Phase III INPULSIS® trials investigated
the efficacy and safety of nintedanib versus placebo in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
To obtain an overall estimate of the treatment effect of nintedanib 150 mg twice daily (bid), pooled and
meta-analyses of data from these three trials were conducted.
Methods: Pooled and meta-analyses were conducted for annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity
(FVC), time to first acute exacerbation, change from baseline in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire
(SGRQ) total score and mortality over 52 weeks.
Results: 1231 patients (nintedanib n ¼ 723, placebo n ¼ 508) were included in the pooled analysis.
Adjusted annual rate of decline in FVC was �112.4 mL/year with nintedanib and �223.3 mL/year with
placebo (difference: 110.9 mL/year [95% CI: 78.5, 143.3]; p < 0.0001). The hazard ratio for time to first
acute exacerbation was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.83; p ¼ 0.0047). Adjusted mean change from baseline in
SGRQ score at week 52 was 2.92 with nintedanib and 4.97 with placebo (difference: �2.05 [95%
CI: �3.59, �0.50]; p ¼ 0.0095). Hazard ratios for time to all-cause and on-treatment mortality were 0.70
(95% CI: 0.46, 1.08; p ¼ 0.0954) and 0.57 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.97; p ¼ 0.0274), respectively, in favour of
nintedanib. The meta-analysis was generally consistent with the pooled analysis. Diarrhoea was the most
frequent adverse event in the nintedanib group (61.5% of patients treated with nintedanib versus 17.9% of
patients treated with placebo).
Conclusion: Nintedanib has a beneficial effect on slowing disease progression in patients with IPF.

1. Introduction
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an interstitial lung disease
characterised by worsening dyspnoea, decline in forced vital ca-
pacity (FVC) and deterioration in patients' health-related quality of
life (HRQL) [1e4]. While IPF is ultimately fatal, its clinical course is
variable and unpredictable, with some patients experiencing a
rapid decline in lung function while others progress much more
slowly [3,5]. Some patients with IPF experience sudden de-
teriorations in symptoms and respiratory function during periods
of relative stability, which are known as acute exacerbations when

 the cause of the acute deterioration is unknown [6].
Nintedanib,
an
intracellular
inhibitor
of
tyrosine
kinases
including the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), platelet-
derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor (VEGFR) [7], has been approved for the
treatment of IPF in the US [8] and EU [9]. The efficacy and safety of
nintedanib in patients with IPF have been investigated in three
international Phase II/III trials with similar design. The TOMORROW
trial (period 1) was a Phase II randomised, placebo-controlled, 52-
week, dose-finding trial of nintedanib in 428 patients with IPF [10].
Patients were randomised to one of four doses of nintedanib or
placebo using a stepwise increasing dose approach. The primary
endpoint was the annual rate of decline in FVC; secondary end-
points included change from baseline in total score on the St
George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) over 52 weeks, an in-
strument originally developed for patients with obstructive lung
disease, but frequently used to evaluate HRQL in patients with IPF
[11], and the incidence of and time to first investigator-reported
acute exacerbation. Compared with placebo, nintedanib 150 mg
bid was associated with a reduced annual rate of decline in FVC, a
decrease in SGRQ total score, and a lower incidence of acute ex-
acerbations and had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile
[10]. Based on the findings of the TOMORROW trial, nintedanib
150 mg bid was investigated in two replicate, randomised, placebo-
controlled, 52-week, Phase III trials: the INPULSIS® trials [12]. As in
the TOMORROW trial, the primary endpoint in the INPULSIS® trials
was the annual rate of decline in FVC. Time to first investigator-
reported acute exacerbation and change from baseline in SGRQ
total score, both analysed over 52 weeks, were key secondary
endpoints.
Compared
with
placebo,
nintedanib
significantly
reduced the annual rate of decline in FVC in both INPULSIS® trials.
In INPULSIS®-2, there was a significant difference in favour of
nintedanib on time to first acute exacerbation and change from
baseline in SGRQ total score, while there was no significant differ-
ence between the nintedanib and placebo groups for either key
secondary endpoint in INPULSIS®-1. Nintedanib had a tolerability
profile that was manageable for most patients, with diarrhoea be-
ing the most frequently reported adverse event [12]. All-cause, on-
treatment and respiratory mortality were secondary endpoints in
the TOMORROW and INPULSIS® trials; however, none of these trials
was powered to show a difference in mortality between nintedanib
and placebo.
In order to obtain an overall estimate of the treatment effect of
nintedanib 150 mg bid, data from the nintedanib 150 mg bid and
placebo groups of the TOMORROW and INPULSIS® trials were
pooled. The similarity of the trial designs and the consistent results
observed on the primary endpoint justified the data from these
three trials being pooled. Due to some differences in data collection
and efficacy analyses between the TOMORROW and INPULSIS®
trials, a meta-analysis was also conducted. Safety data from the
trials were pooled to obtain a more precise estimate of the inci-
dence of adverse events.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Pooled analysis
A pooled analysis of data from the nintedanib 150 mg bid and
placebo groups from the TOMORROW and INPULSIS® trials was
conducted on the primary and key secondary endpoints in the
INPULSIS® trials (annual rate of decline in FVC, time to first
investigator-reported acute exacerbation, change from baseline in
SGRQ total score), plus change from baseline in FVC % predicted
over 52 weeks, and all-cause, on-treatment and respiratory
mortality.
Small differences in data collection, time windowing and
censoring rules between the TOMORROW and INPULSIS® trials
were addressed as follows. In the TOMORROW trial, FVC data were
collected in litres; these were converted into millilitres for the
pooled analysis. In the TOMORROW trial, FVC data collected after
premature discontinuation of trial drug were not used in the pri-
mary analyses and if �1 FVC measurement was allocated to the
same visit, only the first assessment was used. Conversely, in the
INPULSIS® trials, data collected after premature discontinuation of
trial drug were used in the primary analysis and if �1 measurement
was allocated to the same visit, time windowing was used to select
the assessment closest to the planned visit. For the pooled analysis,
data collected after premature discontinuation of trial drug in
TOMORROW were included and time windowing was applied as
per the INPULSIS® trials. Similarly, unlike in the INPULSIS® trials, in
the TOMORROW trial, SGRQ data were not collected after prema-
ture discontinuation of trial drug or during the post-treatment
follow-up period and if �1 SGRQ assessment was allocated to the
same visit, only the first assessment was used. For the pooled
analysis, all the data from the TOMORROW and INPULSIS® trials up
to 372 days (plus 7-day margin) after randomisation were included
and time windowing was applied as per the INPULSIS® trials. There
were small differences in the definition of an acute exacerbation
between the TOMORROW and INPULSIS® trials [10,12]. In the
TOMORROW and INPULSIS® trials, time to first acute exacerbation
was analysed using data collected up to 366 and 372 days (plus 7-
day margin) after randomisation, respectively; patients who did
not experience an event were then censored. For the pooled anal-
ysis, data collected up to 372 days (plus 7-day margin) in all three
trials were used.
For mortality endpoints, a blinded adjudication committee
reviewed medical documentation to adjudicate the primary cause
of deaths in the TOMORROW and INPULSIS® trials. Results for
respiratory mortality were based on results of this adjudication.
Analyses for all-cause and respiratory mortality were based on data
collected between randomisation and up to 372 days after ran-
domisation. On-treatment mortality was defined as deaths that
occurred between randomisation and the end of the post-
treatment follow-up period (28 days in the INPULSIS® trials and
up to 14 days in the TOMORROW trial).
The statistical models used in the pooled analysis were the same
as those used in the INPULSIS® trials [12] except for the addition of
trial as a fixed effect.
Safety was assessed by means of clinical and laboratory evalu-
ation at study visits and the recording of adverse events using the
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) (version
16.1). Safety analyses were descriptive.
All pooled analyses were based on data from patients who
received �1 dose of trial drug (treated set).
2.2. Meta-analysis
A meta-analysis was performed on the primary and key sec-
ondary endpoints in the INPULSIS® trials, plus change from baseline
in FVC % predicted over 52 weeks, and all-cause and respiratory
mortality, using data from the nintedanib 150 mg bid and placebo
groups from the three trials. The nintedanib versus placebo esti-
mates from the primary analyses conducted in the three trials were
used to obtain estimates of the overall treatment effect. Efficacy
analyses were based on patients who were randomised in the
TOMORROW trial and patients who received �1 dose of trial drug
(treated set) in the INPULSIS® trials. Standard meta-analysis
methodology was used (see Supplementary Material for further
details).

 3. Results
3.1. Patients
The pooled data set included 723 patients treated with ninte-
danib and 508 patients treated with placebo; baseline character-
istics were similar between the nintedanib and placebo groups
(Table 1). Baseline characteristics were generally similar across the
individual trials except for a higher proportion of Asian patients in
INPULSIS®-2 (Supplementary Table S1).
3.2. Exposure
Mean (SD) total duration of exposure was 10.2 (3.4) months in
patients treated with nintedanib and 10.8 (2.9) months in patients
treated with placebo. Median total duration of exposure was 11.9
months in both groups.
3.3. Pooled analysis
3.3.1. Annual rate of decline in FVC and change from baseline in FVC
% predicted
In the pooled analysis, the adjusted annual rate of decline in FVC
was �112.4 mL/year (95% CI: �133.2, �91.5) with nintedanib
and �223.3 mL/year (95% CI: �248.1, �198.5) with placebo (dif-
ference: 110.9 mL/year [95% CI: 78.5, 143.3]; p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1).
Observed changes in FVC over time in the pooled analysis are
presented in Fig. 2. The adjusted absolute mean change from
baseline in
FVC %

at
week 52
was �2.8% (95%
CI:
�3.3,
�2.2)
in
the
nintedanib
group
and
�6.0%
(95%
CI: �6.6, �5.3) in the placebo group (difference: 3.2% [95% CI: 2.5,
4.0]; p < 0.0001).
3.3.2. Time to first investigator-reported acute exacerbation
In the pooled analysis, the hazard ratio (HR) for time to first
acute exacerbation was 0.53 ([95% CI: 0.34, 0.83]; p ¼ 0.0047), in
favour of nintedanib (Fig. 3). The proportion of patients with �1
acute exacerbation was 4.6% in the nintedanib group and 8.7% in
the placebo group.
3.3.3. SGRQ total score
In the pooled analysis, the adjusted mean change from baseline
in SGRQ total score at week 52 was 2.92 (95% CI: 1.83, 4.01) in the
nintedanib group and 4.97 (95% CI: 3.75, 6.19) in the placebo group
(difference: �2.05 [95% CI: �3.59, �0.50]; p ¼ 0.0095) in favour of
nintedanib (Fig. 4).
3.3.4. Mortality
A 30% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality was observed
with nintedanib versus placebo over 52 weeks (HR 0.70 [95% CI:
0.46, 1.08]; p ¼ 0.0954). The proportion of patients who died from
any cause over 52 weeks was 5.8% in the nintedanib group and 8.3%
in the placebo group. Nintedanib significantly reduced the risk of
on-treatment mortality versus placebo (HR 0.57 [95% CI: 0.34,
0.97]; p ¼ 0.0274). The proportion of patients who died during the
on-treatment period was 3.5% in the nintedanib group and 6.7% in
the placebo group. A 38% reduction in the risk of respiratory mor-
tality was observed with nintedanib versus placebo over 52 weeks
(HR 0.62 [95% CI: 0.37,1.06]; p ¼ 0.0779). The proportion of patients
who died due to a respiratory cause over 52 weeks was 3.6% in the
nintedanib group and 5.7% in the placebo group.
3.3.5. Adverse events
A summary of pooled data on adverse events is presented in
Table 2. Data on adverse events in the individual trials are shown in
Supplementary Table S2. Adverse events led to premature treat-
ment discontinuation in 20.6% of patients in the nintedanib group
versus 15.0% of patients in the placebo group. The most frequently
reported adverse event in patients treated with nintedanib was
diarrhoea, which was reported in 61.5% of patients in the

led to premature treatment discontinuation in 5.3% versus 0.2% of
patients in these groups, respectively. The proportion of patients
who had �1 serious adverse event was comparable between the
nintedanib and placebo groups (30.0% and 30.1%, respectively).
3.4. Meta-analysis
In general, the treatment effect sizes observed in the pooled
analyses were confirmed in the meta-analysis (See Supplementary
Material).
4. Discussion
We conducted a pooled analysis of data from the three inter-
national randomised, placebo-controlled, 52-week trials of ninte-
danib in patients with IPF, which was complemented with a meta-
analysis. In general, the treatment effect sizes were similar across
the pooled and meta-analyses. Nintedanib consistently slowed
disease progression by significantly reducing the annual rate of
decline in FVC compared with placebo. The treatment effect of
nintedanib on change from baseline in SGRQ total score was
modest and consistent across the pooled and meta-analyses.

 A significant benefit in favour of nintedanib on time to first
investigator-reported acute exacerbation was observed in the
pooled analysis. In all models, the hazard ratio estimates were
associated with wide confidence intervals due to the small number
of acute exacerbations observed. In a recent systematic review of
published data on the clinical effectiveness of treatments for IPF
and meta-analysis of key efficacy outcomes, Loveman et al. reported
a significant odds ratio of 0.50 (95% CI: 0.31, 0.79) in favour of
nintedanib compared with placebo for the proportion of patients
experiencing �1 investigator-reported acute exacerbation in the
TOMORROW and INPULSIS® trials [13]. In this meta-analysis, data
on the proportion of patients experiencing an acute exacerbation
(odds ratio) were used whereas in our meta-analysis, data on time
to first acute exacerbation (hazard ratio) were used, as per the key
secondary endpoint defined in the INPULSIS® trials; however, the
results obtained in the two analyses were consistent.
As well as being consistent across the TOMORROW and INPUL-
SIS® trials and across analyses, the treatment effect of nintedanib
has been shown to be consistent across patient subgroups. In pre-
specified subgroup analyses of pooled data from just the INPUL-
SIS® trials a consistent effect of nintedanib on the annual rate of
decline in FVC, time to first investigator-reported acute exacerba-
tion and change from baseline in SGRQ total score was demon-
strated across subgroups of patients defined by a variety of baseline
characteristics, including sex, age (<65, �65 years), race (White,
Asian) and baseline FVC % predicted (�70%, >70%) [14].
Due to relatively low death rates in patients with IPF and mild or
moderate impairment of lung function, an adequately powered
trial to assess mortality in this population would be challenging
[2,15]. However, mortality is a clinically meaningful endpoint in IPF,
and pooling the data from three trials allowed for a more precise
estimate on the effect of nintedanib on mortality. In this pooled
analysis of data from the TOMORROW and INPULSIS® trials, there
were trends towards a reduction in the risk of all-cause and res-
piratory mortality and a significant reduction in the risk of on-
treatment mortality. In addition, in the meta-analysis of the
TOMORROW and INPULSIS® trials conducted by Loveman et al. [13],
there was a significantly lower odds ratio for absolute decline in
FVC of >10% predicted with nintedanib compared with placebo at
week 52. These findings reflect the overall beneficial effects of
nintedanib on slowing disease progression and have been used to
further support the appropriateness of decline in FVC as a primary
endpoint in clinical trials in patients with IPF [16].
The safety and tolerability profile of nintedanib based on the
pooled data was as expected based on the results of the individual
trials, with gastrointestinal events, particularly diarrhoea, being the
most frequently reported adverse events in patients treated with
nintedanib but leading to premature treatment discontinuation in
around 5% of patients treated with nintedanib.
5. Conclusions
The totality of evidence from the TOMORROW and INPULSIS®
trials supports the conclusion that there is a beneficial effect of
nintedanib on slowing disease progression in patients with IPF.
Estimates of the treatment effect of nintedanib were consistent
across analyses.
