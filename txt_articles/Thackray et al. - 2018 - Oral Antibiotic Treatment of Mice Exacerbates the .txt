SUMMARY
Although the outcome of flavivirus infection can vary
from asymptomatic to lethal, environmental factors
modulating disease severity are poorly defined.
Here, we observed increased susceptibility of mice
to severe West Nile (WNV), Dengue, and Zika virus in-
fections after treatment with oral antibiotics (Abx)
that depleted the gut microbiota. Abx treatment
impaired the development of optimal T cell re-
sponses, with decreased levels of WNV-specific
CD8+ T cells associated with increased infection
and immunopathology. Abx treatments that resulted
in enhanced WNV susceptibility generated changes
in the overall structure of the gut bacterial community
and in the abundance of specific bacterial taxa. As
little as 3 days of treatment with ampicillin was suffi-
cient to alter host immunity and WNV outcome. Our
results identify oral Abx therapy as a potential envi-
ronmental determinant of systemic viral disease,
and they raise the possibility that perturbation of
the gut microbiota may have deleterious conse-
quences for subsequent flavivirus infections.
INTRODUCTION
Flaviviruses including West Nile (WNV), Dengue (DENV), and Zika
(ZIKV) viruses account for approximately 400 million infections
annually, with billions at risk and no specific therapy available.
In humans, the majority of WNV and DENV infections are subclin-
ical, with severe illness occurring in only a subset of individuals
(Chancey et al., 2015; Halstead, 2007). Patient age, underlying
immune or chronic disease status, and polymorphisms in im-
mune genes (e.g., CCR5, OAS1, and TNF) are associated with
increased susceptibility to WNV and DENV infections (Bigham
et al., 2011; Lim et al., 2009, 2010; Lindsey et al., 2012; Loeb,
2013; Racsa et al., 2014). However, these factors do not account
for most adverse outcomes. The contribution of environmental
factors to flavivirus disease severity remains poorly defined.
Host defense mechanisms that control flavivirus replication
and dissemination have been studied extensively (Diamond
and Pierson, 2015; Suthar et al., 2013). Immune factors that
modulate disease severity of WNV infection include type I inter-
feron (IFN) responses, serum anti-WNV IgM titers, FoxP3+ CD4+
T regulatory cells (Tregs), and CD8+ T cell responses (Diamond
et al., 2003; Lanteri et al., 2009; Samuel and Diamond, 2005;
Shrestha and Diamond, 2004). Mechanisms that determine dis-
ease severity of DENV infection include Fc-g receptor-mediated
antibody-dependent enhancement of infection of myeloid cells
and plasma levels of secreted NS1 protein (Diamond and Pier-
son, 2015; Katzelnick et al., 2017).
Antibiotic (Abx) consumption in humans continues to increase
with greater than 800 courses of Abx prescribed annually per
1,000 people in outpatient populations in the United States alone
(Hicks et al., 2015; Suda et al., 2014; Van Boeckel et al., 2014).
Although anti-flavivirus activity has been demonstrated in vitro
for some Abx (De Burghgraeve et al., 2012; Kaptein et al.,
2010; Michaelis et al., 2007; Retallack et al., 2016; Zhang
et al., 2009), their ability to modulate flavivirus pathogenesis
in vivo has not been demonstrated. Oral Abx treatment that per-
turbs the gut microbiota (herein, microbiota) of mice inhibited
poliovirus and reovirus replication, mouse mammary tumor virus
transmission, and murine norovirus (MNoV) infection and persis-
tence (Baldridge et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2014; Kane et al., 2011;
Kuss et al., 2011). However, oral Abx treatment also delayed
lymphocytic
choriomeningitis
virus
(LCMV)
clearance
and
increased influenza virus (IAV) pathogenesis in mice (Abt et al.,
2012; Ichinohe et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2013), suggesting that dif-
ferential interactions between specific viruses, microbial com-
munity members, and/or the host may modulate the outcome
of infection.
Here we show that treatment of mice with oral Abx resulted in
increased susceptibility to severe WNV, DENV, and ZIKV infec-
tions. Oral administration of an Abx cocktail comprised of vanco-
mycin (V), neomycin (N), ampicillin (A), and metronidizole (M),
herein referred to as VNAM, resulted in lethality, impaired host

 immunity, and increased WNV burden. VNAM treatment resulted
in fewer WNV-specific CD8+ T cells and Tregs in the draining
popliteal lymph node (DLN) and spleen. Adoptive transfer of
both primed CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was required to reverse
the the effect of VNAM treatment on WNV susceptibility. Treat-
ment of mice with A or V alone was sufficient to alter WNV
outcome. However, the addition of M was required to generate
the fully vulnerable phenotype. A and AM treatment depleted
the gut bacterial community biomass and differentially altered
bacterial community structure and the abundance of specific
bacterial taxa. Our results identify oral Abx treatment as a poten-
tial risk factor for disease severity during subsequent flavivirus
infection, and they suggest that depletion and/or perturbation
of the microbiota may adversely impact host antiviral immunity.
RESULTS
Oral Abx Treatment Alters Susceptibility to Flavivirus
Infections
We treated C57BL/6J mice for 14 days before subcutanteous
inoculation of WNV in the footpad, and then, throughout the
course of infection (14 days continuous; Figure 1A), with a
broad-spectrum Abx cocktail, VNAM, that depletes the micro-
biota (Baldridge et al., 2015). VNAM-treated mice were more
susceptible to WNV infection than mice treated with vehicle
alone (Figure 1B). Since reciprocal interactions between the
host immune system and the microbiota can influence virus
infection (Hand, 2016; Kuhn and Stappenbeck, 2013; Pfeiffer
and Virgin, 2016), we evaluated the effect of Abx treatment on
the outcome of WNV infection in several immunodeficient strains
of mice. We observed increased susceptibility to WNV infection
following VNAM treatment, even in the absence of signaling
through the interferon lambda (IFN-l) receptor (Ifnlr1, also called
IL-28Ra) (Figure S1A). In contrast, previous studies showed that
signaling through IFN-l is required for the effects of oral Abx
treatment on MNoV clearance (Baldridge et al., 2015). The effect
of Abx on WNV outcome also occurred in the absence of Toll-like
receptor (TLR)2- and TLR5-pathogen sensing, caspase 1/11-
mediated inflammasome activation, cGAS- and STING-medi-
ated DNA sensing, and STAT6-mediated induction of type 2 im-
munity (Figures S1B–S1G), all of which are pathways linked to
host-microbiota interactions in prior studies (Burrows et al.,
2015; Fricke et al., 2015; Ichinohe et al., 2011; Oh et al., 2014;
Watson et al., 2015).
We examined the durability of the effect of oral Abx on WNV
outcome. Mice were treated with VNAM for 14 days, and then
VNAM was replaced with vehicle for 3 (3-day stop), 7 (7-day
stop), or 14 (14-day stop) days before WNV inoculation (Abx
stop, blue lines, Figure 1A). As a control, mice were treated
with vehicle or Abx for 17 (3-day stop), 21 (7-day stop), or 28
(14-day stop) days before WNV inoculation and continuously
during infection (vehicle, black lines; Abx, red lines, Figure 1A).
Increased lethality was observed for Abx-stop mice when
VNAM was replaced with vehicle for 3 or 7 days before WNV
inoculation; however, resistance to WNV infection was restored
between 7 and 14 days after cessation of oral Abx (Figure 1C).
Mice treated with VNAM starting 3 days before inoculation and
throughout the course of infection (3-day continuous; Figure 1A)
showed increased susceptibility to WNV infection compared to
vehicle-treated controls (Figure 1D). In addition, mice given
VNAM for 3 days followed by unsupplemented drinking water
for 3 days before inoculation (3-day pulse; Figure 1A) still showed
increased susceptibility to WNV compared to vehicle-treated
controls (Figure 1E). Thus, the continued presence of oral Abx
was not required to promote WNV infection, consistent with
the idea that perturbation of the microbiota alters flavivirus
pathogenesis.
To examine the generality of the effect of Abx treatment on fla-
vivirus infection, we treated mice lacking the IFN-a/b receptor
(Ifnar1�/�) for 14 days with VNAM before inoculation with
DENV and then throughout the course of infection; Ifnar1�/�
mice were used as DENV replicates poorly in immunocompetent
mice (Zellweger and Shresta, 2014). In contrast to vehicle-
treated Ifnar1�/� controls, VNAM-treated Ifnar1�/� mice suc-
cumbed to DENV infection (Figure 1F), demonstrating that oral
Abx can enhance susceptibility to another flavirus infection and
that this occurs even in the absence of type I IFN immunity.
Indeed, we also administered a 3-day pulse treatment of
VNAM to Ifnar1f/fLysMCre+/+ mice, which lack Ifnar1 expression
only in macrophages, granulocytes, and some dendritic cell sub-
sets; these mice were used because wild-type and Ifnar1�/�
mice are fully resistant or vulnerable to subcutaneous inoculation
of ZIKV, respectively (Lazear et al., 2016). We observed
increased susceptibility to severe ZIKV infection in VNAM-
treated Ifnar1f/fLysMCre+/+ mice compared to vehicle-treated
controls (Figure 1G). Thus, even a short exposure to oral Abx
increased the disease severity of distinct flaviviruses.
Oral Abx Treatment Increases Viral Burden
To define the basis for the enhanced virulence of WNV associ-
ated with Abx treatment, we evaluated viral burden in different
tissues after 14 days of continuous VNAM treatment. We
observed little alteration of virus levels in the DLN or spleen,
but we detected more WNV in the brain and spinal cord of
VNAM-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated controls at
days 9 and 10 after infection (Figures 2A and 2B). More ZIKV
also was detected in the brain of Ifnar1f/fLysMCre+/+ mice treated
with a 3-day pulse of VNAM compared to vehicle-treated con-
trols (Figure S2A).
Since previous reports have documented WNV infection in the
gut (Brown et al., 2007; Kimura et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2015),
we examined viral burden along the length of the gastrointestinal
tract. We observed more WNV at days 8–10 after infection in the
duodenum, ileum, and colon of VNAM-treated mice compared
to vehicle-treated controls (Figure 2C). In contrast to the DLN,
we observed more WNV at days 2, 4, 8, 9, and 10 in the mesen-
teric lymph node (MLN) of VNAM-treated mice compared to
vehicle-treated controls (Figure 2D).
Oral Abx Treatment Impairs Virus-Specific CD8+ T Cell
Responses
Since we mainly observed enhanced WNV burden later during
the course of infection, we examined components of adaptive
immunity at day 8 in various tissues after a 14-day continuous
VNAM treatment. We observed decreased numbers of leuko-
cytes, B cells, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the DLN and spleen,

(B and D–G) Wild-type (WT) (B, D, and E), Ifnar1�/� (F), or Ifnar1f/fLysMCre+/+ (G) C57BL/6 mice were treated with vehicle (Kool-Aid) or vehicle supplemented with
VNAM for 14 days before virus inoculation and during infection (14-day continuous) (B and F), for 3 days before virus inoculation and during infection (3-day
continuous) (D), or for 3 days followed by drinking water for 3 days before virus inoculation (3-day pulse) (E and G).
(C) WT mice were treated with VNAM for 14 days, and then VNAM was replaced with vehicle for 3, 7, or 14 days before WNV inoculation (VNAM-stop). Other WT
mice were treated for 17, 21, or 28 days before WNV inoculation and continuously during infection (vehicle, VNAM).
(B–G) Mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 102 focus-forming units (FFU) of WNV at 12 weeks of age (B–E), intravenously with 105 FFU of DENV at 6 weeks
of age (F), or subcutaneously with 103 FFU of ZIKV at 4 weeks of age (G).
Survival curves were compared using the log-rank test with a Bonferroni correction (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001). Results were combined
from two to five independent experiments: vehicle (n = 30), VNAM (n = 29) (B); 3 day-stop: vehicle (n = 10), VNAM (n = 10), VNAM-stop (n = 10); 7-day stop: vehicle
(n = 15), VNAM (n = 15), VNAM-stop (n = 15); 14-day stop: vehicle (n = 10), VNAM (n = 10), VNAM-stop (n = 10) (C); vehicle (n = 15), VNAM (n = 15) (D); vehicle
(n = 15), VNAM (n = 15) (E); vehicle (n = 16), VNAM (n = 15) (F); and vehicle (n = 21), VNAM (n = 22) (G). See also Figure S1.

 as well as diminished numbers and percentages of CD8+ T cells
in the brain of VNAM-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated
controls (Figures 3A and 3B; Figure S3A). In contrast, we
observed increased numbers of leukocytes and CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells, as well as increased numbers and percentages
of B cells, in the MLN of VNAM-treated mice compared to
vehicle-treated controls, suggesting that the effects of oral Abx
treatment may differ between gut-proximal (MLN) and gut-distal
(DLN and spleen) lymphoid tissues.
Consistent with an effect of Abx treatment on WNV burden
later rather than earlier in infection, we did not observe differ-
ences in serum cytokine levels or WNV-specific neutralizing ac-
tivity in mice after a 14-day continuous VNAM treatment
compared to vehicle-treated controls (Figures S4A and S4B).
Since decreased Treg frequencies are associated with increased
disease severity following WNV infection (Lanteri et al., 2009), we
profiled Tregs in the DLN, MLN, and spleen (Figure S3A). We
observed fewer Tregs in the DLN and spleen of VNAM-treated
mice compared to vehicle-treated controls, but no differences
in the percentages of Tregs (Figure 3C). In contrast, we observed
equivalent numbers of Tregs in the MLN of VNAM-treated mice
compared to vehicle-treated controls (Figure 3C), suggesting
that oral Abx treatment may alter the accumulation of Tregs in
a tissue-specific manner. As equivalent numbers of Tregs were
found in the spleen of ZIKV-infected vehicle- and VNAM-treated
Ifnar1f/fLysMCre+/+ mice (Figure S2C), an impact of oral Abx
treatment on Tregs may not be required to increase susceptibility
to severe flavivirus infection.
Since virus-specific effector CD8+ T cells are required to clear
WNV from the CNS (Brien et al., 2007; Shrestha and Diamond,
2007; Shrestha et al., 2006a, 2012), we examined the anti-
gen specificity and polyfunctionality of the CD8+ T cells after
14 days of continuous VNAM treatment (Figures S3A and S3B).
Decreased numbers and percentages of Db-NS4B-tetramer+
(WNV-specific) CD8+ T cells were detected in the spleen of
VNAM-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated controls (Fig-
ure 3D). Consistent with these data, diminished ZIKV-specific
CD8+ T cell responses were found in the spleen of VNAM-treated
Ifnar1f/fLysMCre+/+ mice compared to vehicle-treated controls
(Figure S2D). As decreased numbers of WNV-specific CD8+
T cells were observed in the DLN and brain of VNAM-treated
mice whereas equivalent numbers were detected in the MLN
(Figure 3D), we conclude that oral Abx treatment appears to
impair antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses in a tissue-spe-
cific manner.
Although we observed no statistically significant Abx-induced
alterations in the numbers and percentages of polyfunctional
CD8+ T cells in the DLN or MLN (Figures 3E and 3F), decreased
numbers and percentages of CD8+ T cells expressing granzyme
B (GzB), IFN-g, and/or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) were
evident in the spleen and brain of VNAM-treated mice compared
to vehicle-treated controls. As the levels of effector molecules
per cell or the ratio of single-, double-, or triple-positive effector
CD8+ T cells were similar between vehicle- and VNAM-treated
mice (Figures S4C and S4D), oral Abx treatment appears to
affect priming, proliferation, and/or trafficking rather than matu-
ration of effector CD8+ T cells.
Oral Abx Treatment Impacts a Host Niche Important for
Optimal Virus-Specific T Cell Responses
To explore further the role of CD8+ T cells in the effect of oral Abx
treatment on WNV pathogenesis, we assessed viral infection in
mice lacking CD8a+ T cells (Cd8�/�) after a 14-day continuous
treatment with VNAM. We examined viral burden in lieu of

 survival as Cd8�/� mice uniformly succumb to WNV (Shrestha
and Diamond, 2004). Similar levels of WNV were observed in
all tissues examined at 8 days after inoculation in vehicle- and
VNAM-treated Cd8�/� mice (Figure 4A), suggesting that Abx-
induced changes in CD8+ T cells are important for increasing
the virulence of flavivirus infection.
We evaluated the role of virus-specific CD8+ T cells following
oral Abx treatment in transgenic (Tg) mice expressing a CD8+
T cell receptor recognizing the Db-restricted WNV NS4B peptide
(Kim et al., 2014). Even though more than 90% of the CD8+
T cells of NS4B+/� Tg mice recognized the NS4B peptide (Fig-
ure S3C), we still observed increased susceptibility to WNV
infection following a 14-day continuous VNAM treatment com-
pared to vehicle-treated controls (p < 0.001; Figure 4B), consis-
tent with the idea that more WNV-specific CD8+ T cell precursors
cannot reverse the effect of Abx treatment on immunity when
primed in an Abx-treated host.
We next evaluated whether adoptive transfer of T cells from
mice that had not received Abx was sufficient to reverse the sus-
ceptibility phenotype to WNV infection observed after 14 days of
VNAM treatment. Increased survival was observed in recipient
VNAM-treated mice when WNV-primed, but not naive, donor
T cells were transferred 1 day after WNV inoculation (Figures
4C and 4D). Transfer of WNV-primed CD8+ T cells, however,
was not sufficient to fully overcome the effect of Abx treatment
(Figure 4D).
To determine whether Abx treatment intrinsically impairs the
function of WNV-specific T cells, we transferred WNV-primed
T cells from wild-type mice treated for 14 days with vehicle or
VNAM into untreated mice lacking T cells (Tcrbd�/�) (Figure 4E).
Resistance to WNV infection was observed in Tcrbd�/� mice re-
constituted with WNV-primed T cells from either vehicle- or
VNAM-treated mice at 1 day after WNV inoculation (Figure 4F).
These data suggest that oral Abx treatment impairs optimal
T cell responses in specific contexts, i.e., T cells that control
WNV pathogenesis can develop in an Abx-treated environment
but function optimally in an untreated environment, and,
conversely, T cells can control WNV pathogenesis in an Abx-
treated environment when they are primed in an untreated
environment.

comparisons were not statistically significant (p > 0.05, Mann-Whitney test). Survival curves (B, D, and F) were compared using the log-rank test with a Bonferroni

 Oral Abx Treatment Impairs Host Immunity prior to Virus

Since hematopoiesis is modulated by the microbiota (Balmer

in the absence of infection (Figure S5A). After a 14-day treatment

SiglecH� pre-DC1 progenitors (pre-DC1s), and lineage� Flt3+
ckitlo CD115+ MHCII� CD11c+ pre-DC2 progenitors (pre-DC2s)
were not observed in the bone marrow (Figure 5A). These data
show that oral Abx treatment can impact hematopoiesis in
the bone marrow, similar to results from a previous study
(Josefsdottir et al., 2017).
Cross-presentation by dendritic cells (DCs) contributes to the
priming of WNV-specific CD8+ T cell responses (Hildner et al.,
2008). We examined the number and percentage of DCs, as well
as other immune cell subsets, in the spleen of naive vehicle- and
VNAM-treated mice (Figure S5B). Fewer total leukocytes, B cells,
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, Tregs, as well as CD11c+ B220� MHCII+
myeloid and CD11cINT Bst2+ plasmacytoid DCs, were present in
the spleens of VNAM-treated naive mice compared to vehicle-
treated controls (Figures 5B and 5C). Although we observed lower
numbers of CD11c+ B220� MHCII+ CD24+ CD172� (DC1) and
CD11c+ B220� MHCII+ CD24� CD172+ (DC2) splenic DC subsets
in VNAM-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated naive controls
(Figure 5C), the ability of DC1 cells to cross-present cell-associ-
ated ovalbumin to MHC class I-restricted, ovalbumin-specific
CD8+ T cells (OT-1) was not impaired (Figure 5D). These findings
suggest that decreased numbers of DCs, rather than their anti-
gen-presenting potential, may contribute to impaired virus-spe-
cific CD8+ T responses after Abx treatment.
The Impact of the Microbiota on Susceptibility to WNV
Infection
To address whether the effects of Abx treatment on flavivirus
infection were related to changes in the configuration of host mi-
crobial communities, we examined whether transfering micro-
biota after cessation of Abx, either by co-housing coprophagic
animals or by gavage of cecal contents, could reverse the sus-
ceptibility phenotype. Female mice treated with vehicle or
VNAM for 14 days and then co-housed for 7 days before WNV
inoculation in the absence of treatment (Figure S6A) retained
disparate susceptibility to WNV infection (Figure S6B). VNAM-
stop mice gavaged with control PBS or cecal microbiota from
vehicle- or VNAM-treated mice (Figure S6C) all exhibited similar
susceptility to WNV infection compared to vehicle-treated con-
trols (Figure S6D), suggesting that the effect of oral Abx on
WNV infection was refractory to these microbial transfer ap-
proaches. However, VNAM-stop mice exposed to cecal micro-
biota from other VNAM-treated mice had increased susceptibil-
ity to WNV compared to VNAM-stop mice that received cecal
microbiota from vehicle-treated mice. In comparison, transfer
of cecal microbiota from VNAM-treated mice did not increase
the susceptibility of vehicle-treated mice to WNV (Figure 6D).
These data indicate that the microbiota in VNAM-treated mice
may contribute to increased susceptibility to WNV pathogenesis,
but only in Abx-treated mice.
Wenext assessedwhich Abx inthe VNAMcocktail was required
for the effect on WNV outcome and whether this effect was asso-
ciated with alterations in the microbiota. We treated mice for
14 days before and during WNV infection with single or combina-
tions of Abx. Mice treated with either A or V had an intermediate
susceptibility to severe WNV infection compared to vehicle-
treated controls (Figures 6A and 6B). N was not required for
increased susceptibility to WNV infection (Figure 6A). Although
treatment with M did not confer increased susceptibility, it was
required for optimal effects, since mice treated with VNA had an
intermediate susceptibility and mice treated with AM or VM had
increased susceptibility to WNV infection (Figure 6A). The
increased susceptibility of mice treated with A, V, AM, VM, or
VNAM,butnotMorNalone,allowedustoidentifyacorrelation be-
tween decreased microbiota biomass, as defined by the reduced
number of bacterial 16S rRNA copies per fecal pellet, and viral
virulence (Figure 6C). Vulnerability to WNV infection also was
associated with decreased WNV-specific CD8+ T cell responses
in the spleen of A- or AM-treated, but not M- or N-treated, mice
compared to vehicle-treated controls (Figure 6D).
To assess further the effects on the microbiota of Abx treat-
ments that modulated WNV outcome, we re-examined the
impact of treatment with A, M, or AM on WNV outcome in an
experiment using a single batch of 45 age-matched female
mice obtained from a single source and that were individually
housed. Mice treated for 2 weeks before and during WNV infec-
tion with A or AM had intermediate (8 of 15) or substantial (8 of 10)
susceptibility to WNV infection, respectively, compared to
vehicle-treated controls (3 of 10) (Figure 6E). A- and AM-treated
mice, but not M-treated mice, had a substantial reduction in total
bacterial biomass 3 days after treatment compared to vehicle-
treated controls (Figure 6F). Sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons
(C and F) Fecal samples were harvested at 14 days after treatment (C) or 0–20 days after treatment (F). Bacterial 16S rRNA copy number was determined by
qPCR. The dotted line represents the limit of detection. Statistical significance was determined using ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple-comparison test (*p < 0.05
and ****p < 0.0001).
(D) The numbers (left) and percentages (right) of WNV-specific CD8+ T cells. Statistical significance was determined using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s
multiple-comparison test (*p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01).
(G) The effect of treatment on b-diversity (defined using the UniFrac phylogenetic dissimilarity metric). Statistical significance of six pairwise comparisons (V
versus M, V versus A, V versus AM, M versus A, M versus AM, and A versus AM) for each time point from 0 to 20 days was determined using ADONIS with p < 0.05
considered significant (day 0, all comparisons were not significant, except for V versus AM and M versus AM; days 3–20, all comparisons were significant, except
for day 16 V versus M).
(H) The effect of treatment on the abundance of bacterial taxa. Statistical significance was determined using the likelihood-ratio test of pairwise comparisons
between all treatments and vehicle from 0 to 20 days. Unique sequences determined to be significant (p < 0.05) with a mean abundance of more than 100 reads
were identified for each pairwise comparison. Plots display the abundances of a set of these taxa over time using the general additive model smoothed line for
each treatment. Results were combined from two to five independent experiments using male and female mice, except for two experiments in which a single
group of individually housed female mice was used (B and E–H): vehicle (n = 24), A (n = 20), V (n = 25), M (n = 20), N (n = 20), AM (n = 20), VM (n = 20), VNA (n = 25),
VAM, (n = 15) VNAM (n = 15) (A); vehicle (n = 15), A (n = 30) (B); vehicle (n = 9–10), A (n = 9–10), M (n = 10), N (n = 9–10), AM (n = 10) (C and D); and vehicle (n = 10), A
(n = 15), M (n = 10), AM (n = 10) (E–H). See also Figures S6 and S7 and Table S1.

 revealed a decrease in the proportional representation of Bacter-
oidetes and an increase in the Firmicutes and Proteobacteria
over time in A-treated mice. A-treated mice also had an expan-
sion of Tenericutes at 3 days after treatment (Figure S7A). In
contrast, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes decreased in AM-treated
mice over time to below the limits of detection, with a concomi-
tant expansion of Protobacteria (Figure S7A). Comparisons of
Abx treatments showed differences in measures of a-diversity
(Figure S7B) and b-diversity between vehicle-treated controls
and A-, M-, and AM-treated mice, as well as among A-, M-,
and AM-treated mice (Figure 6G). These analyses identified dif-
ferences in overall bacterial community structure that are asso-
ciated with increased WNV virulence.
To determine whether the Abx treatments that differentially
altered WNV outcome could be distinguished by the abundance
of specific bacterial taxa, we performed likelihood ratio tests at
different time points. We identified 72 bacterial 16S rRNA ampli-
con sequence variants (ASVs) across the six pairwise compari-
sons (vehicle versus A, vehicle versus M, vehicle versus AM, M
versus A, M versus AM, A versus AM) (Table S1). Taxonomic
assignment revealed an ASV with similarity to Alistipes onder-
donkii that was decreased in A-, M-, and AM-treated mice
compared to vehicle-treated controls (Figure 6H). Other ASVs
were altered in M-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated
controls (Figure 6H; Table S1). An ASV with 100% identity to
Stenotrophomonas hibiscicola (known clinically as Stenotropho-
monas maltophilia), an emerging multi-drug-resistant opportu-
nistic pathogen in humans (Chang et al., 2015; Sa
´ nchez, 2015),
was increased in AM-treated compared to A-treated mice (Fig-
ure 6H). These data show that changes in specific bacterial
taxa were associated with increased virulence of WNV in A-
compared to AM-treated mice.
3 Days of Ampicillin Alone Reduces T Cell Responses
We examined further the effect of a treatment with A, alone or in
combination with M, on WNV outcome. Even a short 3-day pulse
treatment with A, alone or in combination with M, resulted in
increased susceptibility to WNV infection compared to vehicle-
treated controls (Figure 7A). While we did not observe differ-
ences in the numbers or percentages of total B cells and CD4+
or CD8+ T cells in the spleen at day 8 after WNV inoculation (Fig-
ure 7B), we did observe decreased numbers and percentages of
Tregs and WNV-specific CD8+ T cells in the spleens of A- and
AM-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated controls (Figures
7C and 7D). Also, in contrast to what was observed for a
14-day continuous VNAM treatment (Figure 5A), equivalent
numbers of all hematopoietic progenitor cell subsets were de-
tected in the bone marrow of vehicle- and AM-pulsed mice (Fig-
ure 7E), suggesting that alterations in hematopoiesis are not
required for oral Abx to impair Treg and virus-specific CD8+
T cell responses. Thus, even a short 3-day exposure to A was
sufficient to impair T cell responses that likely are important for
resolving the pathogenic outcome of WNV infection.
DISCUSSION
Here we showed that oral treatment with a cocktail of Abx that
alters the microbiota results in increased susceptibility of mice
to severe disease during infection with three different flavivi-
ruses. Treatment of mice with VNAM resulted in fewer virus-spe-
cific effector CD8+ T cells in the DLN, spleen, and brain;
increased virus burden in the gastrointestinal tract and brain;
and increased susceptibility. Treatment of mice with a 3-day
pulse of A or AM also resulted in decreased WNV-specific
CD8+ T cell responses and increased susceptibility. The require-
ment for primed, but not unprimed, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to
reverse the VNAM effect upon adoptive transfer suggests that al-
terations in virus-specific T cells contribute to the effect of Abx
treatment on WNV pathogenesis. Indeed, WNV-specific and
effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells control WNV burden, promote
clearance of WNV from the CNS, and limit disease (Brien et al.,
2007, 2008; Shrestha and Diamond, 2007; Shrestha et al.,
2006a, 2006b, 2008).
VNAM treatment blunted virus-specific effector CD8+ T cell re-
sponses against IAV and LCMV infection, yet spared CD8+ T cell
responses against intranasally administered herpes simplex vi-
rus 2 (Abt et al., 2012; Ichinohe et al., 2011). We observed that
VNAM treatment altered a host environment important for the in-
duction of optimal virus-specific T cell responses, as primed
T cells transferred from VNAM-treated mice could reconstitute
host immunity in Tcrbd�/� mice. The relative preservation of
WNV-specific CD8+ T cell responses in the MLN suggests that
the effect of Abx treatment may be tissue specific.
Tregs are induced by WNV infection, however, their role is
complex (Lanteri et al., 2009). Reduced Treg frequencies in the
blood are associated with increased disease severity in patients
and in mice, potentially due to the ability of Tregs to dampen
WNV-induced immunopathology. Depletion studies in mice
also suggest that Tregs function early in WNV infection to shape
optimal immune control and, thus, limit disease. In our study,
treatment of mice with A, AM, or VNAM resulted in fewer Tregs
in the spleen during WNV infection. However, VNAM treatment
did not decrease Treg numbers in the spleen of ZIKV-infected
mice, suggesting that oral Abx can alter the outcome of flavivirus
infection without necessarily affecting Treg numbers.
The effect of oral Abx treatment occurred after cessation of
treatment, demonstrating that continuous Abx treatment was
not required to increase susceptibility to flavivirus infection.
Treatment with A or AM was sufficient to impair virus-specific
CD8+ T cell responses and alter the outcome of WNV infection.
While both types of Abx similarly reduced bacterial biomass,
they could be distinguished by their effects on community diver-
sity, phylogenetic configuration, and abundance of specific bac-
terial taxa. Although the relative contribution of each to the oral
Abx phenotype remains to be established, the additional sus-
ceptibility in VNAM-stop-treated mice that received cecal
microbiota from other VNAM-treated mice suggests that both
the loss and gain of specific taxa might contribute to increased
susceptibility.
The inability of co-housing or cecal microbiota transfer to
reverse the severe WNV disease phenotype upon VNAM treat-
ment is consistent with the idea that (1) the immune response
deficit induced by depletion and/or perturbation of the micro-
biota requires time for restoration, or (2) critically important bac-
terial effectors are inefficiently transmitted between mice by co-
housing or cecal content inoculation. Our data do not formally

 exclude the possibility that oral Abx treatment itself may
contribute to impaired antiviral immunity. Establishing that com-
ponents of the microbiota per se are critical mediators of Abx ef-
fects will require studies where (1) microbial source tracking is
performed that follows the immigration of members of donor
cecal microbiota to recipient animals and/or the immigration
and emigration of taxa from the microbiota of cagemates in
co-housing experiments, and (2) microbiota transplants are per-
formed from vehicle donors or donors treated with Abx to germ-
free animals with subsequent WNV challenge.
In summary, we have shown that oral Abx treatment in-
creases the risk of severe disease during flavivirus infection in
mice, and we have illuminated a potential role for host microbial
communities in promoting antiviral T cell responses during sys-
temic virus infection. Our data in mice suggest the need for
studies in humans to examine whether exposure to oral Abx,
as well as other agents that perturb the microbiota, is associ-
ated with severe disease during infection by flaviviruses, as
well as other pathogens requiring the rapid induction of T cell re-
sponses for protection.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Cells
Vero and BHK21 cells were cultured at 37�C in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS). C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells were cultured at 28�C in L15 supplemented with 10% FBS and 25 mM HEPES pH 7.3.
All cell lines were originally acquired from American Type Culture Collection and were tested and judged free of mycoplasma
contamination.
Viruses
WNV strain 3000259, New York 2000 (Ebel et al., 2001) and DENV strain D2S20 (Makhluf et al., 2013)] were propagated in Aedes
albopictus C6/36 cells as described (Brien et al., 2013; Pinto et al., 2015). ZIKV strain Dakar 41671 was propagated in Vero cells
as described (Lazear et al., 2016). A full-length contig derived from next generation sequencing confirmed that our ZIKV stock
was identical to the published sequence for ZIKV Dakar 41671 (GenBank: KU955595.1). The titers of WNV, DENV and ZIKV stocks
were determined by focus-forming assay on Vero cells (Brien et al., 2013; Lazear et al., 2016; Pinto et al., 2015).
Mice
This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of
the National Institutes of Health. The protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Washington
University School of Medicine (Assurance number A3381-01). Dissections and footpad injections were performed under anesthesia
that was induced and maintained with ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.
C57BL/6J wild-type mice were purchased commercially (000664, Jackson Laboratories). The original Ifnar1tm1Agt (abbreviated
Ifnar1�/�) and Ifnar1tm1Uka (abbreviated Ifnar1f/f) mice were provided by Michel Aguet (Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer
Research, Lausanne, Switzerland), and Ulrich Kalinke (Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany), respectively (Kamphuis et al.,
2006; M€
uller et al., 1994) Ifnar�/� mice were backcrossed for 10 generations onto the C57BL/6 background. Ifnarf/fLysMCre+/+
mice were backcrossed using speed congenic analysis to 99% C57BL/6 as judged by microsatellite analysis. Ifnlr1tm1Palu (abbrevi-
ated Ifnlr1-/-) mice lacking the entire IL28ra coding sequence (Ank et al., 2008) were obtained from Zymogenetics/Bristol-Myers
Squibb (a gift of S. Doyle). WNV-specific CD8+ T cell receptor transgenic mice (abbreviated NS4B+/�) have been published

 (Kim et al., 2014). B6.129S2-Cd8atm1Mak/J (abbreviated Cd8�/�), B6.129P2-Tcrbtm1Mom Tcrdtm1Mom/J (abbreviated Tcrbd�/�),
Tlr2tm1Kir (abbreviated Tlr2�/�), Tlr5tm1flv (abbreviated Tlr5�/�), Stat6tm1Gru (abbreviated Stat6�/�), Caspase 1tm1Flv (abbreviated
Caspase 1/11�/�), and Tmem173gt (abbreviated Sting�/�) all were purchased commercially (002665, 002122, 004650, 008377,
005977, 016621 and 017537, respectively) from Jackson Laboratories. Mb21d1tm1a mice (abbreviated cGas�/�) lacking the catalytic
residues E211 and D213 were generated as described (Schoggins et al., 2014). Cd8�/�, cGas�/�, Ifnar1�/�, Ifnar1f/fLysMCre+/+,
Ifnlr-/-, NS4B+/�, Tlr2�/�, Tlr5�/�, Stat6�/�, Sting�/�, Tcrbd�/� and Caspase 1/11�/� mice were bred and housed at Washington
University under specific-pathogen-free conditions. Mice were fed a 20% protein diet (PicoLab 5053, Purina) and maintained on a
12 h light/dark cycle (6 am to 6 pm). Male and female mice were housed in groups of up to 5 mice/cage in most studies, except
in co-housing and individual-housing experiments where female mice were used.
Age- and sex-matched male and female mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the footpad with WNV at 12 weeks of age or ZIKV
diluted in PBS at 4 weeks of age, or retroorbitally with DENV diluted in PBS at 6 weeks of age.
METHODS DETAILS
Abx Treatments
Cages of mice were treated ad lib at 4, 10 or 11 weeks of age with an Abx cocktail [1 g/L ampicillin (A), 0.35 g/L vancomycin (V), 1 g/L
metronidazole (M), 1 g/L neomycin (N), Sigma] in 25 g/L grape Kool-Aid (Kraft Foods) or with Kool-Aid alone. In some experiments,
mice were treated with a single or combinations of Abx. Water bottles were changed once per week. In experiments in which mice
were treated with M either alone or in combination, 5 food pellets were soaked for 5 min in Kool-Aid supplemented with Abx. Soaked
food pellets were placed on the cage bottom, and uneaten food pellets were removed three times per week.
Cecal Microbiota Transfer
Cecal contents from mice were collected, diluted in PBS (15 mL/mouse), homogenized by vortexing and minimally clarified by low-
speed centrifugation for 5 min at 300 x g. Mice were then gavaged twice with 150 uL of fresh diluted cecal contents.
16S rDNA qPCR
Fecal samples were harvested into 2 mL tubes (Sarstedt, Germany) with 1-mm diameter zirconia/silica beads (Biospec). Fecal pellets
were flash frozen in a bath of ethanol and dry ice, and stored at �80�C. Fecal nucleic acid was extracted from fecal pellets as
described previously (Baldridge et al., 2015). SYBR green quantitative PCR for bacterial 16S rRNA genes was performed using
primers 515F (50-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-30) and 806R (50-GACTACCAGGGTATCTAATCC-30), and the following cycling con-
ditions: 95�C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95�C for 15 s and 60�C for 1 min. Quantitation of 16S rRNA genes was performed by comparison
to a plasmid standard of pCR2.1 TOPO (ThermoFisher Scientific) containing a 16S rRNA sequence from an uncultured intestinal
bacterium from mice: GACTACCAGGGTATCTAATCCTGTTCGATCCCCACGCTTTCGTGCCTCAGCGTCAGTTGAGCGCCGGTATG

16S rDNA Amplicon Sequencing and Analyses
Bar-coded PCR primers directed at the V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes were used to generate amplicons from nucleic acid
isolated from fecal pellets (Baldridge et al., 2015). Multiplex sequencing of amplicons with sample-specific barcodes was performed
using an Illumina MiSeq instrument (paired end 2x250 nt reads).
Demultiplexing of 16S rRNA amplicon sequences was performed using QIIME (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology,
v.1.8.0) (Caporaso et al., 2010). Read quality control and the resolution of sequence variants (ASVs) was completed using the
dada2 R package (Callahan et al., 2016). Reads were quality-controlled by the removal of the 50 10 bases of the forward read and
30 10 bases of the reverse read. All sequences with Ns and reads mapping to phiX were removed. Error estimation was calculated
on a random subset of 75 samples from the full dataset prior to application of the error model to the full data. Taxonomy was assigned
independently to three 16S rRNA gene sequence databases: (1) GreenGenes 1997, (2) RDP training set 14 and (3) Silva training set
v123 (Cole et al., 2014; McDonald et al., 2012; Quast et al., 2013).
Additional species level assignment to the RDP and Silva training sets was accomplished using the addSpecies function of dada2.
ASVs were aligned using an R implementation of MSA (Bodenhofer et al., 2015) and arranged into a maximum likelihood phylogeny
(GTR model with optimization of the proportion of invariable sites and the gamma rate parameter) using the phangorn package
(Schliep, 2011). The resulting phylogenetic tree was combined with the table of ASVs and merged with sample data for loading
into the PhyloSeq package (McMurdie and Holmes, 2013). ASVs not assigned to the kingdom bacteria or assigned to the mitochon-
drial family or chloroplast class were removed.
PhyloSeq was used to calculate alpha diversity measures of Shannon Diversity and observed richness and beta diversity using
UniFrac (Lozupone et al., 2007). Differential abundance testing of taxa between groups was completed using the DeSeq2 algorithm
using the likelihood-ratio test (Love et al., 2014). Full analysis workflows for dada2 ASV resolution, statistical analysis and plotting,
and count tables are available at https://github.com/shandley/WNV-antibiotics.

 Measurement of Viral Burden
At specific days after virus infection, serum was obtained by intracardiac heart puncture and followed by extensive perfusion. Tissues
were harvested into 2 mL tubes (Sarstedt, Germany) with 1-mm diameter zirconia/silica beads (Biospec), flash frozen in a bath of
ethanol and dry ice, weighted and stored at �80�C. Tissues were homogenized using a bead-beater apparatus and levels of virus
were determined by plaque assay on BHK21 or Vero cells, or by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR using WNV- or ZIKV-specific
primers and probes as described previously (Brien et al., 2013; Govero et al., 2016).
Measurement of Antibody, Cytokines, and Cellular Immune Responses
Focus reduction neutralization assays were performed after mixing serial dilutions of serum with a fixed amount (50 FFU) of WNV as
previously described (Diamond et al., 2003).
Serum cytokine levels at day 8 after WNV inoculation were measured using the 23-plex Bio-Plex Pro assay according to the man-
ufacturer’s protocol (Bio-Rad).
Cells from the DLN, MLN and spleen were dispersed into single cell suspensions with a cell strainer. Brains were minced and
digested with 0.05% collagenase D, 0.1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor TLCK, and 10 mg/ml DNase I in HBSS supplemented with 10 mM
HEPES (pH 7.4; Life Technologies). Cells were dispersed into single cell suspensions with a cell strainer and pelleted through a
30% Percoll cushion for 30 min (1,200 3 g at 4�C). Intracellular IFN-g and TNF-a staining was performed after ex vivo restimulation
with a Db-restricted NS4B immunodominant peptide SSVWNATTA using 1 mM peptide and 5 mg/ml brefeldin A (Sigma) as described
previously (Purtha et al., 2007). Cells were stained with the following reagents and antibodies: Viability Dye (eBioscience, 506), Fc
Block (BD Biosciences, clone 2.4G2), CD3 (BD Biosciences, clone 145-2c11), CD4 (Biolegend, clone RM4-5 or GK1.5), CD8a
(Biolegend, Clone 53-6.7), CD8b (Biolegend, clone YT5156.7.7), CD45 (BD Biosciences, clone 30-F11), CD19 (Biolegend, clone
6D5; BD Biosciences, clone 1D3), FoxP3 (Biolegend, clone MF-14), Granzyme B (Invitrogen, clone GB11), IFN-g (Biolegend, clone
XMG1.2), and TNF-a (Biolegend, clone MP6-XT22). WNV-specific CD8+ T cells were stained using an Alexa-647 tetramer for the
NS4B peptide as described previously (Purtha et al., 2007). ZIKV-specific CD8+ T cells were stained using an APC-labeled tetramer
for the Db-restricted envelope protein peptide IGVSNRDFV (Elong Ngono et al., 2017). Data were collected on a BD LSRII flow
cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo software (Treestar, Inc.).
Isolation of T cells and adoptive cell transfers were performed as previously described (Richner et al., 2015). Briefly, splenocytes
were isolated from mice and erythrocytes were lysed. T cells were purified by negative selection to greater than 90% using the Pan T
Cell or CD8a+ Isolation kits (MACS Miltenyi Biotech). Naive or WNV-primed T cells were counted and adjusted to equal number for
adoptive transfer. Cells (5 3 106) were transferred via the retroorbital route into recipient mice that had been inoculated subcutane-
ously with WNV 24 h earlier.
DC analyses were performed as described previously (Satpathy et al., 2013). Briefly, spleens were minced and digested in 5 mL
Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s media + 10% FCS (cIMDM) with 250 mg/ml collagenase B (Roche) and 30 U/ml DNase I (Sigma-Al-
drich). Cells were dispersed into single cell suspensions with a cell strainer before red blood cells were lysed with ACK lysis buffer.
Cells were counted on a Vi-CELL analyzer (Beckman Coulter). Staining of 2 3 106 cells with the following antibodies was performed at
4�C in the presence of Fc Block in DPBS + 0.5% BSA + 2 mm EDTA): CD8 (BD Biosciences, 53-6.7), CD24 (BD Biosciences, M1/69),
CD172a (BD Biosciences, P84), Bst2 (BD Biosciences, CD317), CD4(Biolegend, RM4-5), TCR-V a2(Biolegend, B20.1), CD11c

(eBioscience), and CD45.1 (Tonbo Biosciences, A20). Cells were analyzed on a BD FACSCanto II or FACSAria II flow cytometer,
and analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar, Inc.).
Cross-presentation analyses were performed as described (Kretzer et al., 2016). Briefly, splenic DCs were sorted as B220– MHCII+
CD11c+ CD24+ CD172– (DC1) and B220– MHCII+ CD11c+ CD24– CD172+ (DC2) cells. OT-1 T cells were sorted as B220– CD4–
CD11c– CD45.1+ CD8+ Va2+ cells. 10,000 DC from vehicle- or VNAM-treated mice were incubated with various doses of heat killed
Listeria monocytogenes and 25,000 CFSE-labeled OT-1 T cells for 3 days in a 37�C 5% CO2 incubator and assayed for CFSE dilution
and CD44 expression of OT-1 cells.
For BM analyses, cells were harvested from the pelvis, tibia, and femurs, ground with a mortar and pestle in PBS supplemented
with 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA, and passed through a 70-mm strainer. Red blood cells were lysed with ammonium chloride–
potassium bicarbonate lysis buffer. Staining with the following antibodies was performed for 2 h at 4�C and 2 h at RT in DPBS +
0.5% BSA + 2 mm EDTA in the presence of Fc Block: SiglecH (eBioscience, 440c), c-kit (BD Biosciences, 2B8), Flt3 (BD Biosciences,

 Statistical Analyses
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size a priori. The experiments were not randomized and the investigators
were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. All data were analyzed using Prism software
(GraphPad10, San Diego, CA). Statistical details of experiments and tests used to analyze experiments are described in the
Figure Legends. An unpaired t test or nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used depending on data distribution for analyses of
cell populations and virus burden.
