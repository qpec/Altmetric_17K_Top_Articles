Abstract
Objective—To assess medical and psychosocial screening and evaluation received by gestational 
carriers and compare those using agencies to those not using agencies.
Design—Cross-sectional questionnaire.
Setting—Online.
Patients—204 women who completed a survey on their experiences as gestational carriers in the 
United States.
Intervention(s)—None.
Main Outcome Measure(s)—Self-reported screening received prior to gestational carrier 
pregnancies.
Results—Overall, 97.1% of gestational carriers had a complete medical evaluation and 94.6% 
had an evaluation or counseling by a mental health professional. Most participants indicated that 
they had been informed of at least some medical risks (92.6%) and psychological considerations 
(89.7%). Participants most often recalled being informed of the risks of multiple pregnancy 
(89.2%) and medical procedures and medications (87.2%), but least often recalled being informed 
about the risks of impact on their own employment (46.6%) and to their own children (61.3%). 
There were no differences between those who used an agency and those who did not on any 
outcome measures.
Conclusion—Self-reported screening and evaluation was high, but still not 100% on all 
measures. Further education of providers regarding guidelines for the screening and evaluation of 
gestational carriers may be needed.

 Introduction
The use of gestational carriers (women who carry the embryo of the intended parent(s) (1)) 
has increased over time in the United States, with gestational carrier cycles representing 
2.5% of all assisted reproductive technology cycles in 2013 (2). Like other pregnancies, 
gestational carrier pregnancies expose women to medical and psychological health risks. 
Obstetric complications are not well documented, but high rates of multiple pregnancy and 
preterm delivery have been reported (2). A recent review indicates that gestational carriers 
and traditional surrogates (women who are inseminated with the intended father’s or a 
donor’s sperm, carry the pregnancy, and relinquish the child(ren) to the intended parent(s) at 
birth (3)) have favorable outcomes on personality tests and most do not have problems 
relinquishing the children, but the quality of evidence in these studies was reported to be 
very low (3), thus, additional studies are needed.
There are a variety of legal issues that may be present in gestational carrier arrangements, 
including those involving coverage of medical bills and custody of the resultant child(ren) 
(4). Laws regarding gestational carrier contracts vary by state within the United States, from 
no laws to surrogacy-friendly laws to complete bans (5). Private agencies specializing in the 
coordination of gestational carrier arrangements, which may be nonprofit or for-profit, may 
assist with providing or coordinating legal representation and other kinds of support, but 
there are no federal or state laws regulating agencies or who can own or operate agencies. 
Private agencies may also assist with matching a potential gestational carrier with the 
intended parent(s) and coordinating medical care, communication, travel, and compensation 
(6). Alternatively, potential gestational carriers and intended parents may meet online or in 
other ways and go on to make arrangements privately. Gestational carriers and intended 
parents may also already know one another as family members, friends, or acquaintances. 
Regardless of how the involved parties meet, they may choose to use an agency or create a 
private agreement with or without legal representation.
In order to “…provide guidelines for screening and testing of genetic parents and gestational 
carriers to reduce the possibility of complications, and to address the complex medical and 
psychological issues that confront the gestational carrier and the intended parents,” the 
American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and the Society for Assisted 
Reproductive Technology (SART) released recommendations in 2012 for the use of 
gestational carriers (7) which were updated in 2015 (8). These recommendations include 
guidelines for the evaluation of potential gestational carriers based on a variety of physical 
and mental health factors, guidelines for advising potential gestational carriers about various 
risks, and a recommendation that compensation to the gestational carrier be noted in a legal 
contract prior to treatment. Guidance is also provided for the evaluation of the intended 
parent(s). Previous research has examined agency and clinic compliance with ASRM/SART 
guidelines for advertising, recruitment, and compensation for egg donors or gestational 
carriers (9–13). However, there have been no reports on compliance with guidelines for the 
screening of gestational carriers or whether the use of an agency affects compliance.

 The purpose of this study was to compare demographic, behavioral, and screening 
characteristics of gestational carriers residing in the United States who did and did not use 
agencies.
Materials and Methods
From November 2015 through February 2016, a cross-sectional study was conducted. 
Women 18 years of age or older living in the United States who had previously delivered a 
baby as the result of a gestational carrier or traditional surrogacy arrangement in 2009 or 
later were eligible to participate. Participants were recruited by posting study 
announcements in various online groups geared toward gestational carriers, including 
websites and message boards. Recruitment materials were also sent to staff who maintain 
email lists for infertility support groups, lawyers, and agencies. These staff then sent out the 
study announcements to their email lists. Eligible participants were invited to complete an 
online survey about their experiences and were reimbursed with a $5 Amazon.com gift card 
for their time. The first screen of the online survey included a consent form. Participants 
indicated that they understood the consent form by responding to the question, “Do you 
agree to the above terms? By selecting “Yes” and clicking the “Next” button, you are 
indicating that you are at least 18 years old, have read and understood this consent form, and 
agree to participate in this research study.”
The survey included questions about participants’ experiences as gestational carriers or 
traditional surrogates, medical and mental health screenings, health behaviors and 
characteristics, use of attorneys and agencies, social support, pregnancy outcomes, 
compensation and reimbursement, and demographic characteristics. Most participants 
completed the survey in under 20 minutes. Participants who were gestational carriers or 
traditional surrogates more than once were asked to respond regarding their most recent 
arrangement and delivery.
Sample size calculations were conducted using Stata SE Version 14.0 (14) and were based 
upon a t-test to detect age differences between traditional surrogates (not included in the 
present analyses) and gestational carriers at the time of last delivery, since one of the original 
aims of the study was to examine differences between traditional surrogates and gestational 
carriers. Based upon previous studies (15,16), a mean age of approximately 31 years and a 
standard deviation of 5.5 were used in the calculations. Multiple potential sample sizes were 
calculated based on different potential mean ages, ranging from 26 to 33, in the gestational 
carriers and traditional surrogates, with total sample sizes ranging from 42 to 240 (21 to 120 
per group). Due to the lack of research in this area and to account for potential missing data 
and possible unequal group sizes, the largest N (240) was selected and was increased by 
25% for a total target sample of N = 300. Recruitment ended per protocol on February 29, 
2016. Traditional surrogates were excluded from these analyses since the ASRM guidance 
was intended to be applied to gestational carriers. Incomplete surveys were also excluded 
from these analyses.
The primary exposure of interest was the use of an agency in arranging the gestational 
carrier agreement. Gestational carriers (n = 204) were asked to indicate how their most

 recent agreement was arranged: through an agency (n = 143), privately or independently (n = 
57), or other, please specify (n = 4). Those who selected the privately or independently 
option were considered to not have used an agency while those who selected other were 
categorized into agency (n = 2) or no agency (n = 2) based upon their text responses.
Outcomes of interest included the receipt of medical and psychosocial screening and 
evaluation prior to the start of their most recent gestational carrier arrangement. These items 
were based upon the screening and evaluation items recommended by the ASRM and SART 
(8). Participants were asked to indicate whether they had each of the following: their own 
lawyer, received medical screenings, received a psychosocial evaluation, been advised about 
several medical and psychosocial risks and considerations, support from their partner and 
family and friends, and discussed medical and lifestyle issues with the intended parent(s). 
Participants were also asked about their alcohol use and their cigarette, tobacco, and nicotine 
use in the 6 months prior to their most recent arrangement. Whether each participant had at 
least one previous term, uncomplicated pregnancy was assessed, as well as the number of 
live births (categorized as ≤5 live births and >5 live births) and cesarean sections 
(categorized as ≤3 cesarean sections and >3 cesarean sections) prior to the arrangement.
Differences between gestational carriers using agencies and those not using agencies in age 
at delivery and number of own children (including biological, adopted, and step-children) 
were assessed using two sample t-tests with equal variances. Differences between groups for 
all other demographic and outcome variables were assessed using chi-squared tests and 
Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables. Statistical significance was assessed at p < 0.05. 
All analyses were conducted using Stata SE Version 14.0 (14). This study was approved by 
the UTMB Institutional Review Board (#15-0245).
Results
Of the 309 respondents who initiated the survey, 248 met eligibility criteria, and 222 
completed the survey. Incomplete surveys (26/248), defined as those who did not respond to 
any demographic questions, were excluded from analysis. Of the 222 complete responses, 
204 (91.9%) were gestational carriers and 18 (8.1%) were traditional surrogates. Traditional 
surrogates were excluded from these analyses. Among gestational carriers, 145 (71.1%) used 
an agency while 59 (28.9%) did not use an agency.
The mean age of respondents was 33.0 (standard deviation (SD) 5.3) and the mean number 
of own children was 2.7 (SD 1.4) (Table 1). Respondents were primarily white (92.6%), 
non-Hispanic (96.1%), married or living together (87.3%), and employed full-time (55.7%). 
Few participants had used public assistance in the last year (7.4%). The majority of 
participants (65.2%) were first time gestational carriers.
Most participants had their own lawyer (92.0%), had a previous term uncomplicated 
pregnancy (97.6%), received evaluation or counseling by a mental health professional 
(94.6%), and received a complete medical evaluation (97.1%) (Table 2). Among participants 
with a male partner, most (85.9%) indicated that the partner had a medical evaluation. Social 
support was high, with 95.7% indicating that they had support from their partner (if

 partnered) and 92.6% indicating that they had support from family or friends. The majority 
of participants (93.6%) indicated that they did not drink more than 1 drink containing 
alcohol per day in the 6 months leading up to their arrangement and 100% of the participants 
indicated that they did not use cigarettes, tobacco, or nicotine.
Most participants reported that they had been advised of at least one medical risk listed 
(92.6%) and at least one psychosocial risk listed (89.7%) (Table 3). Participants were most 
likely to report that they had been informed of the risk of multiple pregnancy (89.2%) and 
least likely to report that they had been informed of the risk of potential impact on 
employment (46.6%). The majority of respondents indicated that they had discussed with the 
intended parent(s) prenatal diagnostic testing (91.7%), pregnancy termination (96.1%), and 
activity regarding travel, exercise, diet, and vitamin supplements (94.6%).
There were few differences between gestational carriers who used agencies and those who 
did not. Gestational carriers who used agencies were younger (32.5 years vs. 34.3 years) and 
had fewer of their own children (2.6 vs. 3.1) than those who did not use agencies (Table 1). 
Those who used an agency were more likely to be first time carriers than those who did not 
use an agency (69.7% vs. 54.2%). There were no differences between groups on other 
demographic measures, including relationship status, race, ethnicity, educational attainment, 
household income, religion, employment status, student status, health insurance, or use of 
public assistance in the last year.
In addition, there were no differences between gestational carriers who used agencies and 
those who did not on medical, legal, or social support measures. The majority of participants 
in each group had their own lawyer (93.0% for those using agencies vs. 89.5% for those not 
using agencies), received evaluation or counseling by a mental health professional prior to 
the arrangement (95.8% vs. 91.4%), and received a complete medical evaluation prior to the 
arrangement (96.6% vs. 98.3%) (Table 2). No differences were observed between groups on 
alcohol use or cigarette, tobacco, or nicotine use.
Finally, there were no differences between gestational carriers who used an agency and those 
who did not on psychosocial and counseling measures. The majority of participants 
indicated being advised of all of the medical risks listed (75.0% for those using agencies vs. 
74.6% for those not using agencies) (Table 3), but fewer participants indicated that they had 
been informed of all of the psychosocial risks and considerations (40.0% vs. 35.6%). Most 
participants indicated that they had discussed with the intended parent(s) prenatal diagnostic 
testing (89.7% vs. 96.6%), pregnancy termination (95.1% vs. 98.3%), and lifestyle activities 
(95.2% vs. 93.2%), such as travel, exercise, diet, and vitamin supplements.
Discussion
The guidelines for screening and evaluation of parties involved in gestational carrier 
arrangements were developed to provide some consistency for providers and practices. To 
ensure that negative outcomes for all parties remain infrequent, the guidelines are intended 
to address a variety of medical and psychological risks inherent in gestational carrier 
arrangements (8). While overall self-reported screening of gestational carriers in the present

 study was high, each measure was below 100%. Almost all participants reported being 
informed of risks related to procedures and medications, but were less likely to report 
discussing possible psychosocial consequences. It may be especially troubling that over ten 
percent of participants reported that they had not been informed of the risk of multiple 
pregnancy and over one quarter of participants reported that they were not informed of the 
demands and risks of the medical protocol, coping with the pregnancy, risks of attachment to 
the child, and risks to their own children and marriage or partnership. This suggests that 
further education of providers regarding guidelines for the use of gestational carriers may be 
needed to ensure that potential gestational carriers are adequately informed.
Though the ASRM has stated that gestational carriers should receive fair compensation, 
there may be ethical dilemmas when there are differences in socioeconomic status between 
gestational carriers and intended parents or when gestational carriers are economically 
disadvantaged (17). Overall, the majority of the participants in this study did not appear to 
be a socioeconomically vulnerable group, though approximately one in four participants 
reported a household income under $50,000 per year. The respondents were often highly 
educated, had moderate to high household income, were married or partnered, and few used 
public assistance. These results may dispel some concerns about the vulnerability or 
financial coercion of gestational carriers who live in the United States, though further 
research may be necessary to ensure that financial coercion is not occurring in the 
recruitment and use of gestational carriers.
This study also compared demographic characteristics and screening among gestational 
carriers using and not using agencies. While there were no differences in self-reported 
screening by agency use, there were some demographic differences between gestational 
carriers using and not using agencies. Whether the differences by agency use in age, number 
of own children, and being a first time carrier impact medical or psychological outcomes 
should be investigated, especially in light of a recent review finding a need for more and 
higher quality research into the outcomes of gestational carrier arrangements (3).
This study has several strengths. We surveyed 204 gestational carriers which exceeds the 
sample size of most prior social and behavioral studies on gestational carriers. Moreover, we 
obtained information on the screenings and evaluations they received prior to achieving 
pregnancy. This was also the first study to examine differences between gestational carriers 
using and not using agencies.
There are several limitations to this study. The survey relied entirely on participant self-
report which is subject to recall bias. Future studies could include chart reviews to validate 
self-report of participants from each clinic attended throughout the screening process. The 
study was conducted online which did not allow for the calculation of a response rate since 
no population denominator was available. The results are not generalizable to all gestational 
carriers since those not engaging in social media or who did not have email addresses on file 
with agencies, lawyers, or infertility organizations were not contacted to participate. This 
may have affected our ability to detect differences between groups.

 Gestational carrier arrangements are complicated, requiring the cooperation of multiple 
parties. As the number of gestational carrier cycles in the United States continues to increase 
(2), it is essential that potential gestational carriers continue to be screened prior to 
beginning an arrangement in order to ensure the best possible medical and psychosocial 
outcomes.
