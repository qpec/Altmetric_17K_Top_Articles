Abstract The placenta is the main determinant of fetal growth and development in utero. It
suppliesallthenutrientsandoxygenrequiredforfetalgrowthandsecreteshormonesthatfacilitate
maternalallocationofnutrientstothefetus.Furthermore,theplacentarespondstonutritionaland
metabolic signals in the mother by altering its structural and functional phenotype, which can lead
to changes in maternal resource allocation to the fetus. The molecular mechanisms by which the
placenta senses and responds to environmental cues are poorly understood. This review discusses
the role of the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) in controlling placental resource allocation
to fetal growth, particularly in response to adverse gestational environments. In particular, it
assesses the impact of the IGFs and their signalling machinery on placental morphogenesis,
substrate transport and hormone secretion, primarily in the laboratory species, although it draws
on data from human and other species where relevant. It also considers the role of the IGFs
as environmental signals in linking resource availability to fetal growth through changes in the
morphological and functional phenotype of the placenta. As altered fetal growth is associated
with increased perinatal morbidity and mortality and a greater risk of developing adult-onset
diseases in later life, understanding the role of IGFs during pregnancy in regulating placental
resource allocation to fetal growth is important for identifying the mechanisms underlying the
developmental programming of offspring phenotype by suboptimal intrauterine growth.

Amanda Sferruzzi-Perri received her Bachelor of Science degree with Honours and PhD degree from the University of Adelaide,
Australia (in 2001 and 2007, respectively). In 2008 she received a C. J. Martin Overseas Biomedical Fellowship from the NH&MRC
to undertake research at the University of Cambridge, UK. Through the award of a Next Generation Fellowship from the Centre
for Trophoblast Research in 2011 and a Dorothy Hodgkin Research Fellowship from the Royal Society in 2014, she has been using
a variety of strategies to decipher the role of insulin-like growth factors and their signalling pathway, PI3K, in maternal–placental
fetal interactions governing pregnancy success.
Introduction
Intrauterinegrowthisakeydeterminantoflifespan.Babies
born growth restricted or large for gestational age are
at greater risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality than
those of normal birth weight. Moreover, the ‘memories’
of an altered environment and growth in utero can stretch
beyond the perinatal period to influence health much later
in life. Epidemiological studies in humans have shown that
babies grown abnormally due to poor maternal nutrition
are at heightened risk of developing conditions such as
type 2 diabetes, heart disease and obesity as adults, and
of dying younger as a consequence (Gluckman et al.
2005; Jansson & Powell, 2006). Similarly, manipulating
intrauterine growth experimentally by varying maternal
food intake, dietary composition, oxygen availability,
endocrine status or utero-placental blood flow has been
shown to programme cardiovascular, metabolic and end-
ocrine function of the adult offspring in a wide range of
mammalian species (Gluckman et al. 2005; McMillen &
Robinson, 2005; Fowden et al. 2006).
As the interface between the mother and fetus,
the placenta is one of the main determinants of
intrauterine growth. It supplies all the nutrients and
oxygen required for fetal growth as well as secreting
hormones that influence maternal metabolism in favour
of the fetal needs. Its morphological and functional
characteristics, therefore, have an important role in
determining the allocation of maternal resources to fetal
growth. These characteristics include cell composition,
surface area, barrier thickness, blood flow, vascularity,

nutrient utilisation and the abundance and activity of
the various transporter molecules (Fowden et al. 2009;
Sandovici et al. 2012). Recent studies have shown that
the placenta can respond to maternal nutritional and
metabolic signals by altering these characteristics which,
in turn, leads to changes in the placental capacity to supply
resources to the fetus (Fowden et al. 2009; Sandovici et al.
2012). Thus, the placenta is a key mediator in linking
maternal environmental conditions to development of
the fetus (Burton et al. 2016; Sferruzzi-Perri & Camm,
2016). However, the molecular mechanisms by which
the placenta senses and responds to environmental cues
during pregnancy are poorly understood. This review
discusses the role of the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs)
in controlling placental resource allocation to intrauterine
growth, particularly in relation to maternal environmental
conditions during pregnancy. It focuses primarily on small
laboratory animals, such as the mice, rats and guinea
pigs that are most commonly used for these studies, but
also draws on data from other species, including humans,
where available.
The insulin-like growth factors
The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), IGF1 and IGF2,
are 7.5 kDa single-chained polypeptides that promote
growth, both before and after birth. They affect the
metabolism, mitogenesis, survival and differentiation
of a wide variety of cell types by binding to IGF
receptors (IGF1R and IGF2R), insulin receptor (INSR)
and a hybrid IGF1R–INSR receptor with varying affinity
(Sferruzzi-Perri et al. 2008; Fernandez & Torres-Aleman,
2012; Harris & Westwood, 2012). Their actions are
influenced by at least six different IGF binding proteins
(IGFBP-1toIGFBP-6)andnumerousIGF-relatedbinding
proteins, which alter access of the IGFs to their receptors
and have been reviewed in detail elsewhere (Bach
et al. 2005; Bach, 2015; Clemmons, 2016). The main
signalling receptor for the IGFs is IGF1R, which activates
the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)–protein kinase B
(AKT) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
signalling pathways. IGF2 also binds to the IGF2R, which
can lead to either IGF2 degradation or activation of the
G-protein-coupled signalling pathway (Okamoto et al.
1990).
The Igf2 gene is subject to parental imprinting and
only the paternal allele is expressed. It can be expressed
by different promoters, of which P0 (Igf2P0) is specific
to the placenta in mice (Moore et al. 1997). In mice,
though largely not in humans, the Igf2r gene is also
imprinted but in a reciprocal fashion to Igf2 with
expressionfromthematernalallele(Monketal.2006).The
IGFs (particularly IGF2), their receptors and signalling
pathways are expressed by the placenta in many species
and change in their abundance both developmentally and
in response to environmental cues (Sferruzzi-Perri et al.
2010). In many species, circulating IGF concentrations are
higher during pregnancy than in the non-pregnant animal
and also change in the mother and fetus with proximity to
delivery (Fowden, 2003; Sferruzzi-Perri et al. 2010). IGF2
is more abundant than IGF1 in both the maternal and
fetal circulations in all species studied to date (Fowden,
2003; Sferruzzi-Perri et al. 2010). IGF2 is also more highly
expressed than IGF1 by the placenta in all species studied
to date (Sferruzzi-Perri et al. 2010).
The effects of the insulin-like growth factors
on placental phenotype
The effects of the IGFs on the placenta have been
studied directly in two main ways. First, they have
been given exogenously either to placental cultures
in vitro or to pregnant animals in vivo to study placental
growth, transport and endocrine function. Secondly, the
Igf genes, their receptors and key molecules in their down-
stream pathways have been under- or over-expressed in
genetically modified mice to determine the morphological
and functional consequences for the placenta at different
stages of pregnancy. While the functions of the placenta
are common across species, its structure varies in terms
of shape, organisation of trophoblast lineages, extent
of invasion into the maternal uterus, and degree of
interdigitation at the feto-materno interface (reviewed
in depth elsewhere; Carter, 2007; Wooding & Burton,
2008; Roberts et al. 2016). For instance, the human and
non-human primate placenta is composed of a series of
highly branched structures, called villi. These contain a
mesenchymal core that has fetal capillaries that are closely
associated with an overlying syncytiotrophoblast layer.
The syncytiotrophoblast is directly bathed in maternal
blood and functions in both transport and hormone
secretion. Cytotrophoblast cells, can fuse to form the
syncytiotrophoblast or migrate from the villous tree into
the decidua, where they invade and remodel uterine
spiral arteries to promote blood flow to the placenta. The
syncytiotrophoblast is also bathed in maternal blood in
the mouse, rat and guinea pig placenta. However, the
mouse placenta is arranged into two morphologically
and functionally distinct regions: the labyrinth zone (Lz),
which is responsible primarily for transport, and the
junctional zone (Jz; also known as basal or interlobium
region), which functions in uterine remodelling/invasion
and hormone secretion. In ruminate species like the
sheep and cow, the placenta is composed of individual
placentomes that form at specialised sites called caruncles
in the uterine wall. The overlaying trophoblast layer can be
a syncytium (in sheep) or remains unicellular (columnar
epithelium in cows) and there no invasion of the maternal
blood vessels by trophoblast cells. However, in sheep some

trophoblast cells migrate and fuse with caruncle epithelial
cells and play an endocrine role.

IGF1 and IGF2 prevent apoptosis
and enhance proliferation and migration/invasion of
human placental villous explants, primary trophoblast
cultures and trophoblast cell lines from the first trimester
and term (Table 1). IGF1 also promotes the proliferation,
invasion and survival of first trimester human placental
fibroblasts (Miller et al. 2005) and the differentiation
of
term
trophoblast
cells
into
syncytiotrophoblast
(Bhaumick et al. 1992; Milio et al. 1994; Cohran
et al. 1996). Similarly, IGF1 stimulates proliferation and
migration of murine ectoplacental cone trophoblast in
culture (Kanai-Azuma et al. 1993) and early pregnancy
porcine trophoblast cells (Jeong et al. 2014). Furthermore,
IGF2 promotes differentiation of murine ectoplacental
cone trophoblast and migration of ovine trophoblast cells
in vitro (Kim et al. 2008). Using receptor and pathway
inhibitors and IGF analogues with selectivity for particular
receptors, some of the molecular mechanisms mediating
the actions of IGFs on the human placenta have begun
to be identified in vitro. IGFs appear to mediate their
proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects on trophoblast
through activating IGF1R and triggering the MAPK
and PI3K–AKT signalling pathways, respectively (Forbes
et al. 2008). IGFs also induce trophoblast migration and
invasion through IGF1R, and possibly INSR, with sub-
sequent activation of MAPK and PI3K–AKT signalling
pathways (Diaz et al. 2007; Shields et al. 2007; Forbes
et al. 2008; Mayama et al. 2013). However, IGF2 may also
signal via IGF2R and Gi proteins, MAPK and Rho GTPase
pathways to trigger trophoblast migration and invasion
(McKinnon et al. 2001; Shields et al. 2007; Harris et al.
2011). Thus IGFs promote the growth of different cell
lineagesintheplacentaviamultiplemechanisms(Fig.1A).
In addition to stimulating placental growth, both IGFs
stimulate glucose and System A amino acid uptake, and
IGF1 increases System L activity but reduces lipoprotein
lipase activity in human trophoblast in vitro (Table 1).
However, these changes in nutrient uptake do not
always track with the expression of the transporter genes
or proteins, suggesting that the IGFs may also affect
post-transcriptional/translationalmechanisms(Fangetal.
2006; Jones et al. 2013, 2014). Indeed, IGF1 was recently
shown to stimulate glucose transporter capacity by
increasing the translocation of glucose transporter 1
(GLUT1/SLC2A1) to the trophoblast plasma membrane
(Baumann et al. 2014). In culture, IGF1 prevents the
release of the vasoconstrictors prostaglandin E and F and
thromboxane by the term human placenta and reduces the
agonist-mediated vasoconstriction of human myometrial
arteries (Siler-Khodr et al. 1995; Corcoran et al. 2012).
In vivo, these effects could increase utero-placental blood
flow and substrate transfer in late gestation. Both IGF1
and IGF2 also enhance trophoblast endocrine capacity
in culture. IGFs increase the secretion of hormones
including progesterone, human chorionic gonadotrophin
and placental lactogen in vitro although others, like
placental growth hormone may not be affected (Maruo
etal.1995;Zecketal.2008;Rak-Mardyla&Gregoraszczuk,
2010). In addition, IGF2 simulates the differentiation
of hormone-producing murine and ovine trophoblast
in vitro (Kanai-Azuma et al. 1993; Kim et al. 2008).
Thus, IGFs have the capacity to promote growth, hormone
secretion and substrate transport capacity of the placenta.
In vivo experiments.
Treatment of guinea pig dams with
either IGF1 or IGF2 in early–mid pregnancy increases
fetal weight near term (Table 1; Sferruzzi-Perri et al.
2006). With exogenous IGF1, placental Lz area and
Igf2 gene expression is reduced during the treatment,
even though fetal weight is increased already in mid
pregnancy (Sohlstrom et al. 2001; Sferruzzi-Perri et al.
2007b; Standen et al. 2015). Whilst there is no sustained
effect of either IGF on placental weight, IGF2 increases
the volume and surface area of the transport Lz, near
term (Table 1; Sferruzzi-Perri et al. 2006). Development
of the placental exchange region was further enhanced
when the IGF2R-selective synthetic analogue Leu27-IGF2
was administered maternally (Sferruzzi-Perri et al. 2008).
In mice, maternal Leu27-IGF2 treatment from day 13 of
pregnancy halves the number of fetuses naturally growth
restricted within the litter near term (Charnock et al.
2016). Taken together, these findings suggest that maternal
IGF2 in early gestation may act, in part, via the IGF2R
to enhance functional development of the placenta with
beneficial impacts on fetal growth. However, caution is
warranted as part of the effects of Leu27-IGF2 could be
due to the displacement of endogenous IGF2 and its sub-
sequent interaction with IGF1R and INSR in the placenta.
Exogenous IGFs also modify the functional capacity of
the placenta to supply resources for fetal growth. In the
late pregnant ewe, increasing IGF1 in the fetal circulation
increases amino acid and glucose uptake by the placenta
but may reduce materno-fetal transfer of these sub-
strates, lactate production and the number of placentomes
(Table 1). Increasing IGF1 in the maternal circulation also
alters placental metabolic function in the pregnant ewe
nearterm;glucosetransfercapacityandlactateproduction
are enhanced by an acute infusion of IGF1 (Liu et al. 1994).
In guinea pigs, placental delivery of glucose and/or neutral
amino acids to the fetus is increased in late gestation by
chronic maternal IGF treatment in early–mid pregnancy
(Table1).Thisenhancedplacentaltransferinlategestation
is partly due to increased expression of nutrient trans-
porters (System A amino acid; SNAT2/Snat2/Slc38a2) by
IGF1 in mid pregnancy and improved development of the

et al. 2006, 2007b). In mice, the variability in System
A amino acid transport capacity and conceptus weight
within the litter is abolished by maternal Leu27-IGF2
(Charnock et al. 2016) and data suggest that IGFs may
have most benefit for improving growth of the smallest
pups. Indeed, maternal Leu27-IGF2 improves the weight
offetusesthataregrowthrestrictedduetoalackoftheend-
othelial nitric oxide gene and reduces the number of pups
below the fifth centile of the wild-type population in late
gestation (Charnock et al. 2016). In addition to improving
placental transport function, exogenous IGFs also affect
endocrine capacity in vivo (Fig. 1B). Maternal IGF2
treatmentsimulatesthedevelopmentoftheendocrineJzof
the rat placenta (Van Mieghem et al. 2009) and exogenous
IGF1 and IGF2 increase placental pro-renin activation in
guinea pigs (Standen et al. 2015). Thus, IGFs may also
increase fetal resource supply through changing placental
endocrine function and thus maternal adaptations to
pregnancy, but further studies are warranted.
To circumvent possible confounding effects of systemic
IGF treatment on the mother, approaches are being
developed to target IGFs to the placenta. In mice,
adenoviral-mediated site-specific intraplacental transfer
of the Igf1 gene on day 14 of pregnancy increases the area
of the placenta and the size of the Lz and of the maternal-
and fetal-facing areas 3 days later, although there is no
change in conceptus weight (Table 1; Katz et al. 2009).
In response to liposome-mediated targeting of IGF2 to
the mouse placenta, placental growth is also increased
although fetal weight is not affected (King et al. 2016). In
rabbits, the weight of natural runt fetuses in the litter is
increased2daysfollowingplacentalIgf1transgenedelivery

structure and function of the placenta remains unknown
(Keswani et al. 2015). These data suggest that targeting of
IGF delivery to the placenta may prove an effective method
of improving placental function and thus fetal growth,
particularly when feto-placental growth is impaired.

system. In mice,
knockout of the Igf2 gene in the entire conceptus or
within the fetal or trophoblast cell lineages leads to
placental and fetal growth restriction, with the greatest
reduction in growth seen with ubiquitous Igf2 loss
(Table 2). Similarly, a heterozygous deficiency in the
PI3K-p110α (Pik3ca; homozygous deficiency is lethal) or
complete ablation of the AKT1 (Pkba) or MAPK1 (Erk2)
genes causes feto-placental growth restriction (Cho et al.
2001; Hatano et al. 2003; Yang et al. 2003; Yung et al.
2008; Kent et al. 2012; Sferruzzi-Perri et al. 2016). In
contrast, over-expressing the Igf2 gene through activating
the normally silent maternal gene copy in the H19
null, increasing IGF2 availability via Igf2r ablation, or
deletion of the PI3K signalling inhibitor (Pten) results

in over-growth of the fetus and placenta (Leighton et al.
1995; Ludwig et al. 1996; Louvi et al. 1997; Ripoche et al.
1997; Church et al. 2012). Deletion of the Igf1, Igf1r or
Insr genes in mice also leads to fetal growth restriction,
but placental weight is unaffected (DeChiara et al. 1990;
Baker et al. 1993; Louvi et al. 1997). This suggests that the
growth-promoting effect of IGF2 in the mouse placenta
occurs independently of IGF1R and INSR, possibly
through an unknown, distinct placenta-specific receptor
(XRp) (Louvi et al. 1997). However, evidence from H19
null mutants suggests that IGF1R could contribute to the
control of placental growth in mice as the first exon of
the H19 gene encodes miR-675, which targets Igf1r for
reduced expression (Keniry et al. 2012). Overgrowth of
the H19 null placenta (Leighton et al. 1995; Esquiliano
et al. 2009; Angiolini et al. 2011; Church et al. 2012) is
thus thought to be due to biallelic Igf2 via imprinting
mechanisms, as well as enhanced Igf1r expression through
loss of miR-675 (Keniry et al. 2012). Taken together,
these data highlight the importance and complexity
of the IGF system in controlling conceptus growth in
mice.
Genetic manipulations of Igf2, Igf2r and the down-
stream signalling pathways also affect the morphology
of the placenta (Table 2). For instance, loss of Igf2
(complete and Igf2P0 null), Pik3ca, Pkba or Erk2
gene expression causes defective Lz formation. In
particular, Lz volume/thickness, exchange surface area
and vascularisation are all reduced and the interhaemal
barrier to diffusion of gases such as oxygen is greater in
the placenta of all these mutants (Table 2). In contrast,
in the H19 null, the Lz surface area is increased in line
with the placentomegally observed (Angiolini et al. 2011).
In addition, IGF2 affects the formation of endocrine cells
in the placenta. In particular, loss or gain of Igf2 or the
PI3K–AKT signalling pathway causes a disproportionate
decrease or expansion of the glycogen cells in the Jz,
whereas Igf1r or Insr nulls show no changes in Jz glycogen
cell abundance (Table 2). Collectively, the available
data suggest that IGF2 acts via both the PI3K–AKT
and MAPK pathways to attain normal placental weight
and Lz structure, and through PI3K–AKT signalling
to drive placental glycogen cell formation in mice
(Fig 2A).

function

passive permeability of the placenta to hydrophilic

placental-specific Igf2P0 null and H19 null (Constancia
et al. 2002; Sibley et al. 2004; Coan et al. 2008; Angiolini
et al. 2011). The complete Igf2 null placenta transports less
neutralaminoacid(methylaminoisobutyricacid,MeAIB)
via the System A transporters in association with reduced
SNAT2/Snat2/Slc38a2 expression (Constancia et al. 2005).

System Y+ transporters, responsible for placental trans-
fer of cationic and anionic amino acids, in the complete
Igf2 and the Igf1r null (Matthews et al. 1999). In contrast,
the Igf2P0 null placenta transports more neutral amino
acids via System A, as well as more glucose and calcium
in late gestation (Table 2). Up-regulation of placental
transport capacity is associated with increased expression
of SNAT4/Snat4/Slc38a4 and GLUT3/Glut3/Slc2a3 by the
Igf2P0 deficient placenta. In contrast to Igf2, there is
little or no information on the capacity of the Igf1 or
Insr null placenta to supply nutrients to the fetus. In the
complete Igf2 null, placental and fetal growth restriction
occursconcurrentlyandbecomesevidentinmid-gestation
(Table 2; Baker et al. 1993; Constancia et al. 2005). In the
Igf2P0 null, placental weight is reduced at a similar time in
gestation, but fetal growth only becomes restricted much
closer to term and to a lesser extent than in the complete
Igf2 null (Baker et al. 1993; Constancia et al. 2002, 2005).
Liposome-mediated targeting of IGF2 to the placenta has
recently been shown to increase the weight of Igf2P0
null mouse fetuses near term (Table 1; King et al. 2016).
Collectively, these findings suggest that the Igf2P0 null
placenta compensates for its defective development and
compromised permeability by adaptively up-regulating
its nutrient transport systems and thereby minimises the
degree of fetal growth restriction, relative to the complete
Igf2 null. The Pik3ca heterozygote deficient placenta also
transfers glucose and amino acids via System A trans-
porters with increased efficiency in compensation for its
impaired development, which is associated a less severe
reduction in fetal weight close to term than earlier in
gestation (Sferruzzi-Perri et al. 2016). Moreover, the
naturally small placenta that supports more fetal mass per
gram shows increased expression of Igf2P0 coupled with a
preservation of Lz growth and with increased placental
System A transport capacity and SNAT2/Snat2/Slc38a2
abundance compared to the large placenta in the litter
(Coan et al. 2008). In contrast, the over-grown H19 null
placentashowsdiminishedneutralaminoacidandglucose
transport, which is thought to limit fetal over-growth and
avoid an excessive drain of maternal resources into the
fetus (Angiolini et al. 2011). Thus, IGF2 in the placenta
is important for fine-tuning nutrient supply to the fetus
(Fig. 2B).
In addition to effects on placental transport, the
Igf2 gene may also affect the endocrine function of
the placenta with consequences for maternal physio-
logy during pregnancy. Evidence for this stems from
associations between altered placental Jz formation in H19
and Igf2P0 null mutants and raised circulating glucose,
insulin and/or corticosterone in phenotypically wild-type
dams (Petry et al. 2010; Sferruzzi-Perri et al. 2011). Thus,
IGF2 has an important role in nutrient allocation to the
fetus. By regulating placental phenotype, it balances the
fetal genetic drive for growth with the maternal ability
to supply the required resources, thereby optimising both
offspring and maternal fitness.
IGFs as environmental signals in regulating placental
resource allocation to fetal growth
IGFs may also play an important role in changing placental
resource allocation to the fetus in environmentally
challenged pregnancies. As Igf1 expression is relatively low
in the placenta, studies have largely focused on placental
expression of Igf2 and activation of its signalling pathways
(Table 3). However, since the signalling pathways are
responsive to both IGFs, the placenta can also respond
to changes in circulating IGF1 and IGF2 induced by
nutritional or other environmental cues.
Maternal nutrition.
Undernutrition.
In mice, guinea pigs and baboons,
undernutrition restricts placental growth in association
with a decrease in the expression of Igf2 and/or signalling
via the PI3K–AKT and MAPK pathways (Table 3). There
are also reductions in placental vascularisation, exchange
surface area, Jz volume and glycogen cell abundance
and/or a greater barrier to diffusion with maternal
undernutrition in mice and guinea pigs, morphological
parameters that were altered similarly by a genetic
deficiency in Igf2, Pik3ca, Pkba and Erk2 (Tables 2
and 3). Together, these studies suggest that decreases in
IGF2 expression and signalling within the placenta could
underlie the growth and morphological defects observed
with maternal undernutrition in these species. In larger
animals,theexpressionofIgf2anditssignallingmachinery
reduces, is unchanged or even increases in response to
undernutrition (Table 3). For instance, signalling via
MAPK and PI3K–AKT in the placenta is up-regulated in
nutrient-restricted ewes and heifers (Zhu et al. 2007a,b;
Ma et al. 2011). In these models, changes in signalling
relate to a normalisation of placental weight or an increase
in placental cotyledon vascularity. They also correlate
with a maintenance or restoration of fetal weight in
later gestation, despite an exposure to undernutrition. In
ewes of a moderate condition, which have the smallest
placentas supporting more mass of fetus per gram,
placentalexpressionofIgf2isgreatest(Osgerbyetal.2003).
These studies therefore suggest that in larger species, there
is morphological adaptation of the placental to an adverse
maternal nutritional state through increasing Igf2 and
growth signalling locally.
In the undernourished sheep placenta with increased
PI3K–AKT and MAPK signalling, the expression of
glucose and fatty acid transporters is also increased
(Ma et al. 2011). However, in undernourished baboons,
diminished Igf2 expression and signalling in the placenta
accompanies reductions in Systems A and L amino

acid transporter capacity and glucose transporter gene
expression (Pantham et al. 2015, 2016). Taken together,
these studies suggest that IGF2 and the PI3K–AKT and
MAPK signalling pathways could also mediate changes
in placental transport function during undernutrition. In
mice, despite a 20% reduction in maternal food intake
and placental growth restriction earlier in gestation, fetal
weight is normal until just prior to term (Coan et al.
2010). This maintenance of fetal growth relates to an
initial preservation of Lz development in earlier gestation
and an adaptive up-regulation of System A amino acid
transporter capacity and SNAT2/Snat2/Slc38a2 expression
near term, by the growth restricted undernourished
placenta. However, in mice lacking the placental-specific
Igf2 isoform (Igf2P0), these adaptations to maternal
undernutrition fail to occur. The development of the
placental exchange region is compromised earlier in
gestation, there is no up-regulation of amino acid trans-
port or SNAT2/Snat2/Slc38a2 expression and reduced
SNAT4/Snat4/Slc38a4 abundance near term in Igf2P0 null
placentas compared to wild-type in undernourished mice
(Sferruzzi-Perri et al. 2011). As a result, fetal growth
is restricted earlier in gestation and more adversely
affected near term by undernutrition, in Igf2P0 nulls. The
Igf2P0 transcript is, therefore, a major determinant of the
environmental modification of placental phenotype with
undernutrition in mice. The expression of genes involved
in glucose, neutral amino acid and fatty acid transport, as
well as the IGF signalling pathways in the human placenta
are modified by the diet and physical activity of the mother
during pregnancy (Brett et al. 2015). Thus, the IGF system
may also be important for modifying resource capacity of
the human placenta in response to changes in the maternal
environment.
Low-protein
diets.
During

consumption
of
an

diet
has inconsistent impacts on both placental weight and
placental Igf2 expression (Table 3; Sferruzzi-Perri &
Camm, 2016). However, the nature of the specific effect
appears to depend on the degree of protein deprivation,
stage of pregnancy studied and sex of the conceptus
(Jansson et al. 2006; Coan et al. 2011; Nusken et al.
2011; Gao et al. 2012). Despite the contrasting results,
placental Igf2 expression seems to track positively with
the weight of the placenta in mice and rats (Coan et al.
2011; Nusken et al. 2011; Gao et al. 2012). For instance,
in pregnant mice, low protein diets cause placentomegaly
and the degree of placental weight increase relates to
the level of Igf2 up-regulation at first appearance of
growth enhancement (Coan et al. 2011). The variation
in placental growth and Igf2 expression observed in
different models of protein deficiency could be caused by
the content and source of carbohydrate used to maintain
calorie intake. Nevertheless, taken together, these findings
suggest that at least part of the changes in placental
growth seen with protein deprivation could be mediated
through local changes in Igf2.
There are also changes in placental transport capacity
with gestational protein malnutrition. For instance, in
response to a diet with 8% protein, the mouse placenta
adaptively transports more glucose to the fetus on day
16 of pregnancy (Coan et al. 2011). This up-regulation
occurs when placental Igf2 expression is also increased
and when fetal growth is maintained despite maternal
protein deprivation (Coan et al. 2011). A few days later,
however, glucose transport is unchanged, System A amino
acid transporter abundance is reduced and Igf2 expression
no longer increased in the placenta by a low protein diet,
and fetal growth restriction ensues (Coan et al. 2011).
These data suggest that placental Igf2 may be important
for adapting nutrient supply to the fetus in response
to maternal protein malnutrition in mice. However,
there is evidence that pathways downstream of Igf2 may
also be important. For instance, the mechanistic target
of rapamycin (mTORC1) mediates the mitogenic and
metabolic actions of IGFs (Jansson et al. 2012b). In rats,
protein deprivation reduces mTORC1 signalling, Systems
A and L amino acid transport, and SNAT2/Snat2/Slc38a2,
and L-type amino acid transporter (LAT1/lat1/Slc7a5 and
LAT2/Lat2/Slc7a8) expression by the placenta, prior to
the appearance of placental and fetal growth restriction
(Jansson et al. 2006; Rosario et al. 2011). These findings
suggest that down-regulation of signalling pathways like
mTORC1 and amino acid transporters in the placenta
could link maternal protein restriction to decreases in fetal
growth.Theavailabilityofproteinandspecificaminoacids
during pre-implantation rodent development is linked to
alterations in the expression of genes within the H19-Igf2
locus, mTORC1 signalling and trophoblast cell formation
and differentiation with consequences for feto-placental
phenotype in late gestation (Kwong et al. 2006; Van Winkle
et al. 2006; Eckert et al. 2012; Watkins et al. 2015). Thus,
changes in Igf2 expression and its signalling pathways
could be responsive to the availability of nutrients from
the earliest stages of development.
Diets with excess sugar and/or fat.
The expression
of Igf2 and its signalling pathways in the placenta are
inconsistently altered by diets with excess sugar and/or
fat (Table 3). Weight of the conceptus may also be
reduced, increased or unchanged, depending on the
level of fat in the diet, the amount of simple sugars
consumed and the timing of the dietary manipulation
(Table 3 and reviewed in Sferruzzi-Perri & Camm,
2016). Part of these variations in Igf2 expression and
conceptus growth could be due to the differences in
protein and micronutrient intake, as species like mice
and rats control their calorie intake tightly (Keesey &
Hirvonen, 1997). In mice fed a diet containing 2.5 times

the fat of the controls, placental weight is reduced in early
pregnancy in association with decreases in the expression
of Igf2 and signalling machinery, including Mtor (Sasson
et al. 2015). These placental changes accompanied
reductions in the expression of System A amino acid
transporter, SNAT1/Snat1/Slc38a1, glucose transporter,
GLUT1/Glut1/Slc2a1, and/or fatty acid translocase, CD36,
depending on the length of high fat feeding and whether
the diet was eaten before pregnancy (Sasson et al. 2015).
In over-nourished ewes, placental weight is reduced in
mid-gestation in association with decreased activity of the
IGF signalling pathway (including activation of IRS1 and
mTORC1) and changes in vessel size and density in the
placenta (Zhu et al. 2009; Ma et al. 2010). However, fetal
weight is increased along with fatty acid transporters and
translocases in the placenta, suggesting that alternative
signalling pathways may be activated to adapt placental
nutrient supply to the fetus in ewes with excess food
intake (Zhu et al. 2010; Tuersunjiang et al. 2013).
In other studies, increases in the placental IGF system
are coupled with improved placental resource allocation
to the fetus in dams fed obesogenic diets (King et al. 2013;
Sferruzzi-Perri et al. 2013; Diaz et al. 2015; Rosario et al.
2015, 2016). For instance, in mice, consumption of a high
sugar and fat diet from day 1 of pregnancy initially causes
conceptus growth restriction and morphological defects
in the placental Lz. However, fetal weight normalises by
term, despite the persistence of placental growth and
morphological defects through adaptive up-regulation of
glucose and neutral amino acid transport to the fetus by
the placenta (Sferruzzi-Perri et al. 2013). Up-regulation
of transport capacity relates to increased expression of
GLUT3/Glut3/Slc2a3 and SNAT2/Snat2/Slc38a2, as well as
elevated expression of the placental-specific Igf2 isoform
and PI3K–AKT signalling in the placenta in dams fed a
diet with excess sugar and fat. Obesogenic diets fed from
before pregnancy also increase placental nutrient trans-
porter capacity (glucose, Systems A and L amino acid
and fatty acids) in line with greater Igf2 or PI3K–AKT
and mTORC1 signalling; however, responses varied with
the precise composition of the diet and, possibly, fetal
sex (King et al. 2013; Aye et al. 2015; Diaz et al. 2015;
Rosario et al. 2015, 2016). The expression of IGF signalling
machinery(receptors,AKT,mTORC1)andnutrienttrans-
porters is also altered in the placenta from obese women;
however, the specific nature of these changes appears to
depend on the level of maternal body fat mass, gestational
weight gain and whether macrosomia is observed (Jansson
et al. 2012a; Brett et al. 2016; Martino et al. 2016).
Taken together, these findings suggest that obesity and
obesogenic diets alter placental phenotype in association
with changes in placental Igf2 system and fetal growth.
Maternal hypoxia. In mice, hypoxia typically reduces
fetal growth in a severity-dependent manner without
a change in placental weight (Table 3 and reviewed in
Sferruzzi-Perri & Camm, 2016). However, if the hypoxic
challenge commences early in pregnancy, placentomegaly
is observed in associated with greater maternal blood
spaces and activation of the PI3K–AKT and mTORC1
signalling pathways in the placenta (Matheson et al.
2015). Even though placental weight may not be altered
when maternal hypoxia commenced later in pregnancy,
placental expression of the IGF system and capacity to
supply resources to the fetus is altered (Table 3). In
particular, placental expression of IGF receptors, INSR
and PI3K isoforms is decreased in response to 5 days
of 13–10% maternal hypoxia in late mouse gestation,
and in 10% hypoxia this effect is due to reductions in
maternal food intake (Cuffe et al. 2014; Higgins et al.
2015). However, expression of Igf2, Igf2P0 and activated
AKT increases with 13% hypoxia, but is unchanged or
even decreased in response to 5 days of 12–10% hypoxia
near term (Cuffe et al. 2014; Higgins et al. 2015). In the
13% hypoxic mouse placenta showing increases in Igf2
expression and signalling, there are beneficial changes in
Lz structure including improved vascularisation, maternal
blood spaces and a thinner diffusion barrier to exchange,
changes that would optimise oxygen delivery to the fetus
near term (Higgins et al. 2015; Matheson et al. 2015).
There is also greater placental glucose uptake and trans-
port and maintained delivery of neutral amino acids to
the fetus when 13% hypoxia occurs in the last third
of pregnancy (Higgins et al. 2015). In contrast, in the
12–10% hypoxic placenta with unchanged or decreased
expression of the IGF2 system, the morphology of the
placental Lz is compromised, with reductions in maternal
blood spaces and surface area and a greater barrier to
diffusion, changes that would further limit fetal oxygen
supply in hypoxic dams (Cuffe et al. 2014; Higgins
et al. 2015). Moreover, placental glucose uptake and
transport capacity are not up-regulated or even reduced
(less GLUT1/Glut1/Slc2a1) and delivery of neutral amino
acids diminished, in dams exposed to 12–10% hypo-
xia, depending on whether food intake is reduced and
the sex of the fetus (Cuffe et al. 2014; Higgins et al.
2015). In culture, 1% hypoxia reduces the outgrowth
of mouse ectoplacental cone trophoblast in association
with diminished Igf2 expression (Pringle et al. 2007).
Hypoxia (1% oxygen) also diminishes the expression of
PI3K–AKTandmTORC1signallinginhumantrophoblast
cell lines (Yung et al. 2012a) and modulates IGF1 and
IGF2 signalling in early pregnancy placental mesenchymal
stem cells (Youssef et al. 2014; Youssef & Han, 2016).
Placental expression of the PI3K–AKT and mTORC1
signalling pathways and GLUT1/Glut1/Slc2a1 expression
are decreased in women at 3100 m above sea level
who deliver growth-restricted babies (Zamudio et al.
2006; Yung et al. 2012a). In addition, inducing end-
oplasmic stress in the mouse placental Jz genetically

The IGFs and placental resource allocation to fetal growth

is associated with defects in PI3K–AKT and mTORC1
signalling, altered IGF2 glycosylation and bioactivity, and
with feto-placental growth restriction (Yung et al. 2012b).
Taken together, these findings suggest that activating IGF2
and/or PI3K–AKT signalling in the placenta may be
critical for adapting placental resource allocation to the
fetus during hypoxia in late pregnancy. They also suggest
that the placenta may integrate signals of oxygen and
nutrient availability through the IGF2 system to adapt
its phenotype and optimise maternal resource supply
to fetal growth. Indeed, the mouse Igf2 gene harbours
a hypoxia-responsive element in its promoter (Feldser
et al. 1999), as well as CHORE motifs, which bind the
glucose-responsive transcription factor, MLX (Hunt et al.
2015). Therefore, the availability of oxygen and nutrients
in utero could have direct effects on placental Igf2.
Nutritional and hypoxic challenges alter the concentration
of hormones like the glucocorticoid stress hormone and
insulin, in the maternal circulation (Sferruzzi-Perri et al.
2011; Cuffe et al. 2014). Thus, changes in placental
phenotype may reflect alterations in the metabolic and
endocrine state of the mother.
Maternal endocrine challenges. Endocrine challenges

and thus the partitioning of resource to the conceptus in
pregnancy (Vaughan et al. 2011). Administering cortico-
sterone or the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone
to rodents for 3–7 days reduces fetal and placental
weights during gestation (Table 3; Vaughan et al. 2011).
In mice, corticosterone decreases AKT and mTORC1
activation in association with reductions in feto-placental
weight, Lz vascularisation, and glucose and System A
amino acid transporter capacity; however, the specific
nature of these effects depends on when in pregnancy
the over-exposure occurs (Table 3). Administering the
synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone reduces the
expression of MAPK and weight of placenta in female,
but not male, conceptuses and there is no change in
glucose and SNAT/Snat/Slc38a amino acid transporters
irrespective of fetal sex (Cuffe et al. 2011). In mice,
placental Igf2 expression is unaffected by maternal
administration of corticosterone and dexamethasone
even though the conceptus may be growth restricted
(Cuffe et al. 2011; Vaughan et al. 2012, 2015). Whereas,
restrain stress increases placental Igf2 but does not alter
offspring weight in mice (Pankevich et al. 2009). In rats,
dexamethasone decreases placental Igf2 and the level
of activated AKT, particularly in the endocrine Jz (Ain
et al. 2005). In dexamethasone-treated rats, there are
reductions in the expression of prolactin-related family
genes by the Jz in late gestation, which may influence the
maternal adaptations to pregnancy and, thus, alter the
fetal supply of nutrients indirectly (Ain et al. 2005). The
expression of Igf2 by the term human placenta is also
altered in women with elevated plasma cortisol during
pregnancy due to emotional distress (Mina et al. 2015).
Glucocorticoid response elements have been identified in
the human Igf1 gene promoter (He et al. 2016); however,
very little is known about whether glucocorticoids
could have direct effects on placental Igf2 expression.
Collectively these findings suggest that reductions in the
placental IGF2 system and the functional phenotype of
the placenta could link elevated maternal glucocorticoids
to decreases in fetal growth.
In rats, pre-existing maternal diabetes also alters the
expression of the IGF system in the placenta, as well as
materno-fetal resource allocation; however, the direction
of change depends on how long the dam was insulin
deficient/dysglycaemic. For instance, Igf expression and
IGF1R activation are elevated in association with greater
glycerol and free fatty acid transfer by the placenta
and an increase in fetal weight by 13% in rats that
are diabetic from neonatal life (White et al. 2015).
Placental lipid transport capacity is also increased in rat
dams that are diabetic for 1 week prior to pregnancy
(increase in placental lipoprotein lipase); however, the
expression of Igf2 and the IGF signalling machinery
is decreased and the expression of GLUT1/Glut1/Slc2a1
reduced in association with a more minor increase in fetal
weight (by 5%) (Cisse et al. 2013). Genetically inducing
maternal insulin insensitivity by a global heterozygous
deficiency in PI3K-p110α signalling capacity in the
mouse dam is associated with improved placental Lz
development (larger surface area and thinner barrier to
diffusion), but reduced glucose transport and expression
of nutrient (GLUT1/Glut1/Slc2a1, SNAT1/Snat1/Slc38a1,
SNAT2/Snat2/Slc38a2) and prolactin-related family genes
near term (Sferruzzi-Perri et al. 2016). However, the
specific nature of these placental changes depended
on whether the conceptus itself was heterozygous for
the PI3K-p110α deficiency (Sferruzzi-Perri et al. 2016).
Moreover, there is no effect of maternal heterozygous
deficiency in PI3K-p110α signalling on fetal weight in
this model, irrespective of fetal genotype (Sferruzzi-Perri
et al. 2016). Taken together, these studies suggest that
the IGF2–PI3K-p110α system plays an important role
in modulating fetal nutrition and growth in response to
maternal insulin deficiency and/or insensitivity, by acting
at the level of placental transport phenotype.
Other environmental challenges affecting conceptus
growth. The expression of Igfs, receptors and signalling
machinery in the placenta also changes in response
to insults that affect the placental capacity to supply
the fetus with nutrients. Such insults include reduced
utero-placental blood flow, heat stress and alcohol
consumption (Table 3). Reducing both maternal oxygen
and nutrient supply to the conceptus using uterine artery
ligation in mice, rats and guinea pigs, or placental

embolism in sheep, reduces placental expression of
components of the IGF system in association with defects
in placental Lz structure and in transporter expression
and activity of the glucose and Systems A and L amino
acid transporters (Table 3). The extent of these changes,
however, depends on timing of the insult in the pregnancy.
In sheep, removal of uterine caruncles prior to pregnancy
is associated with increased placental Igf2 expression and
an adaptive increase in placentome size, trophoblast and
maternal capillary volume and surface area, although total
placental mass and fetal weight are reduced (Table 3;
Zhang et al. 2016b). Acute exogenous IGF1 does not alter
nutrient metabolism by the embolised sheep placenta
(Table 1; Jensen et al. 1999). However, several doses of
intra-amniotic IGF1 increase glucose and Systems A and
L amino acid transporter expression by the embolised
placenta and improves feto-placental growth in vivo
(Table 1; Eremia et al. 2007; Wali et al. 2012). Moreover,
in mice with uterine artery ligation, targeting of IGF1 to
the placenta using a nanoparticle or adenoviral-mediated
approach increases the abundance of glucose and Systems
A and L amino acid transporters in the placenta, placental
width and fetal growth (Table 1; Jones et al. 2013,
2014; Abd Ellah et al. 2015). These findings highlight
the therapeutic potential of IGFs for improving the
capacity of the placenta to supply nutrients to the fetus
in compromised pregnancies.

environment from the earliest stages of pregnancy to fetal
growth near term.
Conclusions and perspectives
Thus, IGFs are important regulators of placental resource
allocation to fetal growth both developmentally and
in response to environmental manipulations known
to
programme
the
ill
health
of
offspring.
They
increase placental morphogenesis, substrate transport
and hormone secretion, which, in turn promotes fetal
growth either directly via the supply of nutrients and
oxygen or indirectly viathematernalmetabolic adaptation
to pregnancy and the availability of nutrients for
transplacental transport. In response to environmental
challenges, the IGFs (particularly IGF2) and their
signalling pathways change in line with the alterations
in placental structure and function, and thereby link
changes in the maternal environment to fetal substrate
supply and growth during pregnancy with implications
for developmental programming. The environmentally
induced changes in the IGF system and placental
phenotype may be beneficial (obesogenic diets, moderate
hypoxia and low protein diets) or detrimental (e.g.
severeoxygenandnutrientdeprivationandglucocorticoid
excess) to resource allocation to the fetus depending on
the type, severity and timing of the challenge during
pregnancy (Fig.3).Thebeneficialeffects ofIGF treatments
on placental phenotype show promising therapeutic
potential for improving fetal growth in situations in which
placental growth is impaired without major maternal
compromise, particularly when the treatment with IGF1
or IGF2 is targeted directly to the placenta. However,
efforts to understand the regulation of endogenous
placental IGF expression may also be fruitful, particularly
in the case of Igf2, which appears to be most important
for mediating adaptive responses locally in mice. These
findings are important in the context of human pregnancy
as dysregulated expression of the IGFs and signalling
components are often reported in the human placenta
associated with abnormal fetal growth (Abu-Amero et al.
1998; Sheikh et al. 2001; Gratton et al. 2002; Gurel et al.
2003; Laviola et al. 2005; Scioscia et al. 2006; Street et al.
2006; Trollmann et al. 2007; Akram et al. 2008; Yung
et al. 2008; Colomiere et al. 2009; Borzsonyi et al. 2011;
Street et al. 2011; Demendi et al. 2012; Jansson et al.
2012a; Iniguez et al. 2014; Nawathe et al. 2016; Zhang
et al. 2016a). However, it is important to note that several
causes of environmental, maternal and fetal origin can
lead to changes in placental phenotype and fetal growth
in humans (Gaccioli & Lager, 2016). Thus studies of
animal models showing alterations in the expression of
IGFs and their signalling pathways provide insight but
further information is required on the natural conditions
of variable placental phenotype among humans.
