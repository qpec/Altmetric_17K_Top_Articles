ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To determine which factors influence whether Santa 
Claus will visit children in hospital on Christmas Day.
Design
Retrospective observational study.
setting
Paediatric wards in England, Northern Ireland, 
Scotland, and Wales.
PartiCiPants
186 members of staff who worked on the paediatric 
wards (n=186) during Christmas 2015.
Main OutCOMe Measures
Presence or absence of Santa Claus on the paediatric ward 
during Christmas 2015. This was correlated with rates 
of absenteeism from primary school, conviction rates in 
young people (aged 10-17 years), distance from hospital 
to North Pole (closest city or town to the hospital in 
kilometres, as the reindeer flies), and contextual 
socioeconomic deprivation (index of multiple deprivation).
results
Santa Claus visited most of the paediatric wards in all 
four countries: 89% in England, 100% in Northern Ireland, 
93% in Scotland, and 92% in Wales. The odds of him not 
visiting, however, were significantly higher for paediatric 
wards in areas of higher socioeconomic deprivation in 
England (odds ratio 1.31 (95% confidence interval 1.04 to 
1.71) in England, 1.23 (1.00 to 1.54) in the UK). In contrast, 
there was no correlation with school absenteeism, 
conviction rates, or distance to the North Pole.
COnClusiOn
The results of this study dispel the traditional belief 
that Santa Claus rewards children based on how nice 
or naughty they have been in the previous year. Santa 
Claus is less likely to visit children in hospitals in the 
most deprived areas. Potential solutions include a 
review of Santa’s contract or employment of local 
Santas in poorly represented regions.
Introduction
Santa Claus (also known as Saint Nicholas, St Nick, 
Father Christmas, Kris Kringle, Santy, or simply Santa) 
is a popular Christmas figure celebrated for travelling 
around the world to give children presents on Christ-
mas Day (25 December).
It has long been thought that Santa Claus visits chil-
dren depending on whether they have been naughty or 
nice in the past year (fig 1 ). This belief finds textual sup-
port in the popular holiday song “Santa Claus is coming 
to Town,” written by Fred Coots and Haven Gillespie 
and published in 1934.1  The Christmas classic goes on: 
“he sees when you’re sleeping, he knows when you’re 
awake, he knows if you’ve been bad or good, so be good 
for goodness sake!” Yet no empirical evidence exists to 
support the assertion that Santa Claus rewards children 
based on good behaviour or to establish whether this is 
the only factor determining the likelihood of a visit from 
him.2 We chose to study paediatric hospital wards 
because sick children are the most deserving of a visit 
from Santa Claus at Christmas. We evaluated the rela-
tive importance of children’s behaviour, distance to the 
North Pole, and contextual socioeconomic deprivation 
on the likelihood of a visit from Santa Claus.
Methods
Outcomes
Because auditing departments close over Christmas, 
hospitals hold no records on visits by Santa Claus. 
Therefore we telephoned every UK hospital with a 
 
paediatric ward (obtained from the Royal College of 
Paediatrics and Child Health) and asked the ward staff 
to identify someone who worked on Christmas Day 2015 
and could attest to a visit by Santa Claus. We recorded 
the name and position of the witness and whether or 
not Santa Claus had visited. We also collected addi-
tional information about other superheroes who visited 
the ward on this festive occasion. Data collection 
occurred in July and August 2016.
Determinants
We used the website FreeMapTools (www.freemap-
tools.com) to record the distance (km) between the 
hospital (closest city or town to the hospital) and 
North Pole, as the reindeer flies. We considered two 
sources of data as potential indicators of naughtiness. 
Firstly, rates of absenteeism from primary school as a 
proxy for child behaviour were obtained from 
national government databases in 2015, available 
online for each respective country (England,3  Scot-
land,4  Northern Ireland,5  and Wales6 ) and regions 
within England. School absenteeism was defined by 
the total number of authorised and unauthorised 
absences, counted in sessions where each session is 
equivalent to half a day. Secondly, we obtained data 
from the Ministry of Justice on the conviction rate for 
crimes by young people per 1000 of the 10-17 year old

population.7  Data were unavailable for Kent, Surrey, 
Sussex, Thames Valley, Wessex, Northern Ireland, 
and Scotland. For regions within London we assigned 
values based on the  
conviction rate for ages 10-17 
years in all of London. Contextual socioeconomic 
deprivation was characterised by the index of multi-
ple deprivation, which combines data on seven 
domains of deprivation: income, employment, health 
deprivation and disability, education skills and train-
ing, barriers to housing and services, crime, and liv-
ing environment, as calculated by each of the four 
countries.8-11  Each hospital was assigned a score 
based on the decile ranking of the area in which it is 
located. Since publically available index of multiple 
deprivation deciles in Wales are classed into broader 
categories (deciles 1, 2, 3-5, 6-10), paediatric wards in 
Wales were assigned to the midpoint of their depriva-
tion category. We carried out subanalyses restricted to 
regions within England, and for analyses involving 
conviction data to selected regions within England as 
well as Wales. Table 1 presents the summary statistics 
for the determinants.
For modeling purposes we reversed the coding of the 
deprivation variable (making 10 most deprived and 1 
least deprived) so that our odds ratios could be 
 
interpreted in relation to the effect of increased depriva-
tion on the odds of Santa’s visit.
statistical analyses
We calculated the proportions of paediatric wards vis-
ited by Santa Claus for each of the four countries and for 
regions within England (table 2). Fisher’s exact test was 
used to detect differences between areas in the likeli-
hood of visits.
To explore associations between school absenteeism, 
conviction rates in young people, distance to North 
Pole, and contextual socioeconomic deprivation, we fit 
logistic regression models for the odds of no visit by 
Santa Claus, with each predictor modeled linearly. To 
evaluate potential regional clustering, we fit logistic 
mixed effect models with random regional effects but 
found no evidence of a statistically significant compo-
nent for regional variance. Accordingly, the results of 
the models are reported based on traditional logistic 
regression models (table 3 ). All analyses were con-
ducted in R.12
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for recruitment, design, or implemen-
tation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on 
interpretation or writing up of results. There are no 
plans to disseminate the results of the research to study 
participants or the relevant patient community.
Results
Santa Claus visited 168 (90%) of the 186 paediatric hos-
pital wards in the UK. Of the original 191 paediatric 
wards obtained from the Royal College of Paediatrics 
and Child Health, we excluded five. Of those five

(all in England), staff of one ward declined to answer 
and four wards had closed or been transferred to 
another  
hospital.
All eight of the paediatric wards in Northern Ireland 
were visited by Santa Claus, representing the most 
successful coverage of visits by Santa. Scotland 
achieved second place, with 93% coverage (14/15 
wards), and Wales came third with 92% coverage 
(11/12 wards). Notably, the proportion of wards visited 
in Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales was higher 
than the 89% (135/151 wards) visited in England 
(although relatively smaller numbers of paediatric 
wards led to Fisher’s exact P values of 0.42 for North-
ern Ireland, 0.53 for Scotland, and 0.64 for Wales com-
pared with England) (table 2 ). Within England, 
regional variation was observed in the proportion of 
paediatric wards visited (from a  
minimum of 50% in 
the north east to 100% in south London, Thames Val-
ley, and Wessex, fig 2). The low proportions of paediat-
ric wards visited in the north east (50%) and in north 
west London (71%) point to the need for urgent correc-
tive action by Santa Claus.
naughty or nice?
Based on the results of logistic regression models sum-
marised in table 3, regional rates of school absenteeism 
were not statistically significantly associated with the 
odds of no visit by Santa Claus in either the full UK anal-
ysis or the England subanalysis, although the point esti-
mate in the England subanalysis was substantially 
higher than in the UK analysis. Furthermore, we found 
no association between conviction rates in young peo-
ple and visits from Santa Claus in the subanalysis of 
English regions and Wales.
Distance between hospital and north Pole
In neither the UK analysis nor England subanalysis did 
distance (km) of hospital to the North Pole have a statis-
tically significant effect on whether Santa Claus would 
or would not visit a paediatric ward (table 3).
Contextual socioeconomic deprivation
In the UK analysis, the index of multiple deprivation 
was marginally associated with the odds of not being 
visited by Santa Claus: a 1 unit change in the index of 
multiple deprivation decile from least deprived to most 
deprived was associated with a 1.23 times increase in 
the odds of not being visited by Santa Claus (95% confi-
dence interval 1.00 to 1.54, P=0.06). In the England sub-
analysis, the odds ratio for a 1 unit change in the index 
of multiple deprivation decile was 1.31 (1.04 to 1.71, 
P=0.03). We also explored the relation between index of 
multiple deprivation decile and proportion of visits 
(fig 3). A generally decreasing pattern of visits was 
observed with increasing deprivation across the top five 
deciles (1-5) of deprivation, with only 79% of paediatric 
wards in the fifth decile reporting visits. The pattern of 
visits varied across the bottom five deciles (6-10), with 
all showing fewer visits than the top four deciles (1-4).

local superheroes
Santa Claus was not the only non-clinical visitor to the 
paediatric wards on Christmas Day. Twenty three differ-
ent fictional and non-fictional characters also brought 
festive cheer. Of those, the most popular were elves, fol-
lowed by footballers, pantomime characters, and 
clowns. Elsa (from the animated movie, Frozen) was 
joint fifth with firemen (fig 4).
discussion
Our findings do not support the widely accepted belief 
that Santa Claus only visits children who are nice.13 
 
Dispelling the “naughty or nice” myth has important 
 
implications, including a possible increase in outbursts 
of bad behaviour by children over Christmas if they find 
out. This raises the important ethical question: should 
children be told about this?
Our most important finding is that Santa Claus is less 
likely to visit hospitals in deprived areas. Of note was 
the significant association of visits with index of multi-
ple deprivation decile in England (P=0.03). One possi-
ble reason for the weaker association observed in the 
UK analysis (P=0.056) is that the index of multiple 
deprivation is calculated and summarised differently in 
each of the four countries. A nation specific index of 
multiple deprivation is preferred for policy, planning, 
and resource allocation as it is sensitive to each nation’s 
unique patterns of deprivation, but future analyses of 
Santa’s visitation patterns in relation to contextual 
deprivation across the UK would benefit from a consis-
tent and comparable deprivation metric.14
A surprising finding was that Santa Claus does not 
discriminate against children based on country or 
region (for example, we hypothesised that he would 
prefer to visit Wales and Scotland owing to these coun-
tries seemingly more habitable climates for reindeers). 
Indeed this study shows that distance from the North 
Pole was not a factor that influenced whether Santa 
Claus visited a hospital and confirms the widely held 
belief that he is not limited by distance or time and is 
capable of delivering gifts across the globe within a 24 
hour period.15
It is the authors’ anecdotal experience that children 
rarely voluntarily admit to being naughty. Our study 
therefore included two potential indicators of child 
naughtiness: regional primary school absenteeism and 
conviction rates in young people. Neither is ideal as they 
are measured at a relatively coarse level of geographical 
aggregation, and in the case of conviction rates are sub-
ject to uneven reporting across the regions. The fact that 
we found no significant associations with either indica-
tor suggests that the “nice or naughty” myth can be dis-
pelled, but future research should attempt to obtain 
better individual level estimates of naughtiness in chil-
dren to confirm this finding. We must also acknowledge 
the limitations of these ecological variables: we would 
hope that Santa Claus makes his decisions to visit sick 
children in hospital independent of the naughtiness of 
other children in the region. There are also other poten-
tial predictors of his visits that could not be included in 
our analysis. For example, despite the authors’ best 
efforts, information on the size and characteristics of 
paediatric wards was not available for further analysis of 
the data. A response to the authors’ freedom of informa-
tion request to NHS England was that this information 
was not available. We also caution that although our 
study shows that Santa Claus is less likely to visit paedi-
atric wards in more deprived areas, we cannot conclude 
from our correlational study why this association exists. 
Finally, other variables such as the quality of whisky left 
for him in hospitals, availability of Christmas dinners,16 
availability of chimneys, and free NHS parking spaces for 
reindeers may need to be explored. Whether Santa Claus 
actively discriminates or whether deeper structural fac-
tors are at play needs to be examined through further 
studies.
Why do children in the most deprived areas have it 
worse? One possible theory is that Santa Claus is forced 
to sustain existing inequality, as he is contractually not 
allowed to change anyone’s socioeconomic status.17 
Giving children presents beyond their economic means 
might result in Santa Claus gaining political power and 
thereby causing widespread discontent. This would run 
directly contrary to the primary mission statement of 
the North Pole: the deliverance of cheer.
Finally, the authors (and the hospital staff who 
 
participated in the survey) salute the local heroes and 
visitors who devote their time to visiting sick children in

hospital over Christmas. Even if Santa Claus does not 
reach all areas equally, this is counterbalanced by the 
work of these local heroes, who do a wonderful job 
spreading good cheer to sick children, naughty or nice. 
Surprisingly, the most popular visitors apart from Santa 
Claus were elves and not Elsa!
Conclusion
It has long been thought that Santa Claus gives presents 
to nice but not naughty children. This is the first study, 
to our knowledge, to dispel the myth that Santa visits 
children based on behaviour and suggests socioeco-
nomic deprivation plays a greater role in determining a 
visit. It raises important ethical dilemmas, such as 
whether children should be told and what should be 
done about Santa.
Santa Claus has an incredibly tough job to ensure 
that all the nice children receive presents. Undoubtedly 
deeper socioeconomic factors are at play, even impact-
ing Santa Claus’s abilities to reach out to every child. 
Whether his contract needs to be reviewed or local San-
tas employed in “hard to reach” areas, all we want is for 
every child to be happy this Christmas.
