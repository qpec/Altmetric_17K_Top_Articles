ABSTRACT
Aim or objective The objective of this systematic 
review was to evaluate the evidence regarding rest and 
active treatment/rehabilitation following sport-related 
concussion (SRC).
Design Systematic review.
Data sources MEDLINE (OVID), CINAHL (EbscoHost), 
PsycInfo (OVID), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials (OVID), SPORTDiscus (EbscoHost), EMBASE (OVID) 
and Proquest DissertationsandTheses Global (Proquest) 
were searched systematically.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Studies 
were included if they met the following criteria: (1) 
original research; (2) reported SRC as the diagnosis; 
and (3) evaluated the effect of rest or active treatment/
rehabilitation. Review articles were excluded.
Results Twenty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria 
(9 regarding the effects of rest and 19 evaluating active 
treatment). The methodological quality of the literature 
was limited; only five randomised controlled trials 
(RCTs) met the eligibility criteria. Those RCTs included 
rest, cervical and vestibular rehabilitation, subsymptom 
threshold aerobic exercise and multifaceted collaborative 
care.
Summary/conclusions A brief period (24–48 hours) 
of cognitive and physical rest is appropriate for most 
patients. Following this, patients should be encouraged 
to gradually increase activity. The exact amount and 
duration of rest are not yet well defined and require 
further investigation. The data support interventions 
including cervical and vestibular rehabilitation and 
multifaceted collaborative care. Closely monitored 
subsymptom threshold, submaximal exercise may be of 
benefit.

InTRoDuCTIon
Sport-related concussion (SRC) is among the most 
common sport and recreation injuries.1 2 Most 
athletes recover gradually over the initial days 
following injury, but up to 15% have been reported 
to have time loss of at least 30 days.3 After a concus-
sion, a period of cognitive and physical rest until the 
acute symptoms resolve followed by a progressive 
return to activity according to a protocol of graded 
exertion is recommended.4 This advice is based on 
expert opinion and was developed at sequential 
consensus meetings on concussion in sport.4–6
The symptoms and problems following concus-
sion can vary considerably, and athletes can also 
experience associated injury to the cervical spine or 
peripheral vestibular system. Therefore, a variety of 
treatments may be required that address ongoing 
symptoms and impairments following injury.7 8 The 
purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate 
the evidence related to two questions: (1) What is 
the evidence that rest is beneficial following concus-
sion, and is there an optimal duration of rest? (2) 
What is the evidence that active treatment and 
rehabilitation is effective for athletes who have 
experienced SRC?
METhoDS
The initial search terms used in this systematic 
review, the inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria and 
database selection were generated and reviewed 
by the author group. The draft MEDLINE search 
strategy was then sent to an expert librarian (KAH) 
to ensure its completeness and accuracy. This was 
done according to the PRESS Guideline Statement 
using the CADTH Peer Review Checklist.9 The 
librarian revised and expanded the MEDLINE 
search, and then translated it for the other data-
bases (see online supplementary tables S1 and S2). 
An a priori data extraction table was generated and 
approved by all authors.
The 
following 
electronic 
databases 
were 
searched: MEDLINE (OVID), CINAHL (Ebsco-
Host), PsycInfo (OVID), Cochrane Central Register 
of Controlled Trials (OVID), SPORTDiscus (Ebsco-
Host), EMBASE (OVID) and Proquest Dissertations 
and Theses Global (Proquest). The search was run by 
the expert librarian and exported for review for the 
author group (up to and including articles published 
until 17 October 2016) (see online supplementary 
tables S1 and S2). Duplicates were removed. Refer-
ences of included papers and systematic reviews 
were searched for additional references and authors 
were asked to share any additional references that 
met the inclusion criteria. The total yield of arti-
cles was divided into half and the title and abstract 
of each article was independently reviewed for 
inclusion by two authors for each question (four 
authors in total). To be considered for inclusion in 
this review, articles had to (1) be original research 
(including RCTs, quasi-experimental designs, case 
series, case cross-overs and case studies, cohort 
and case control), (2) have the focus of the study 
be SRC as a source of injury and (3) evaluate the 
effect of rest or treatment. Review articles and arti-
cles published in abstract form only were excluded. 
In the case of disagreement or uncertainty between 
the two reviewers, a third reviewer was engaged 
to resolve the discrepancy and where required,

Review
full-text manuscripts were retrieved to determine eligibility for 
inclusion.
Full texts were retrieved for all included articles, which were 
then subcategorised as per the main topics of rest and treat-
ment. T
wo authors independently extracted data for each of the 
articles and independently evaluated the risk of bias using the 
Downs and Black (DB) checklist for methodological quality.10 
In the case of a discrepancy, the authors discussed the differ-
ence in rating and came to a final rating. In the event that the 
authors were unable to come to a consensus, a third rater was 
engaged. We used this checklist because we anticipated a variety 
of study designs, and this checklist is appropriate for assessing 
randomised and non-randomised studies. A higher rating on the 
DB checklist indicates a lower risk of bias. Studies scoring below 
a 5 on the DB checklist were removed from the review due to a 
high risk of bias. Data were extracted using standardised tables 
and included the following: study design, participants (sample 
size, age, sex, sampling methods), treatment (frequency, inten-
sity, type, timing/duration), outcome measures, key findings 
(point estimates with 95% confidence intervals) and level of 
evidence (per Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine).11
Extracted data were synthesised qualitatively. We present a 
qualitative synthesis of the available data regarding the effec-
tiveness and duration of rest following SRC, and a qualitative 
synthesis of the available data regarding the effectiveness of 
treatment and rehabilitation for athletes with SRC. Meta-anal-
yses were not performed because the intervention and outcome 
data were heterogeneous.
RESulTS
A total of 8224 citations were identified via the electronic data-
base search and 2518 duplicates were removed. Four other 
records were identified for a total of 5710 citations. Of the four 
additional record identified by authors, three were not captured 
in the initial search as they did not mention sports or related 
keywords in the abstract or indexing and one did not include 
terms relevant to treatment or rest. A third reviewer was engaged 
to assess inclusion following screening of title and abstract for 
35 records in which there was disagreement. Forty-one records 
were reviewed in full text and 29 records met the inclusion 
criteria (see figure 1 for PRISMA flow diagram). One study was 
subsequently removed from the review due to its high risk of 
bias (DB score=2) resulting in a total of 28 studies (see online 
supplementary table S3).
A total of 3218 participants (ages 5–53) were included in this 
systematic review. The studies (five RCTs, nine cohort studies, 
two quasi-experimental studies, 12 case series) had varying 
scores on the DB criteria with the RCTs scoring highest—DB 
range: 18–25, cohort studies—DB: 7–23, quasi-experimental—
DB: 15–21 and case series—DB: 6–16.
Rest
Nine studies examined rest following concussion (see online 
supplementary table S3). Six studies included both children and 
adults and three studies included only children. There was one 
eligible RCT that evaluated the effects of strict rest following 
SRC in adolescents and found that both groups had a 20% 
decrease in total energy expenditure following injury.12 The 
individuals who were randomised to recommendation of strict 
rest reported higher total symptom over 10 days and had slower 
symptom resolution.12 T
wo non-randomised treatment studies 
recruiting from the same specialty clinic reported benefit from 
a period of 1 week of prescribed cognitive and physical rest.13 
14 Greater activity level was associated with shorter symptom 
duration in one observational study15 and longer symptom dura-
tion in another.16 T
wo cohort studies found that self-report or 
parent-report of prescription of rest did not predict a longer 
recovery.17 18 T
wo retrospective studies did not find a signifi-
cant association between recommended cognitive rest and time 
to symptom resolution.19 20 In summary, there is conflicting 
evidence on the efficacy of rest following concussion on recovery 
of premorbid function and symptom resolution.
Treatment
Nineteen studies evaluated the effects of treatment following 
SRC (see online supplementary table S3). The majority (16/19 
studies) reported positive effects with treatment but many were 
at high risk of bias (DB scores ranging from 6 to 25 with 11/19 
scores below 16). Common methodological limitations included 
lack of a control group, lack of randomisation and lack of 
control for confounders. One RCT demonstrated positive effects 
with multimodal physiotherapy21 and two RCTs evaluated the 
effects of subsymptom threshold aerobic exercise training—one 
identifying a positive effect22 and the other found no difference 
with training.23 The other RCT evaluated collaborative care, 
including advocacy and coordination with schools regarding 
accommodations 
and 
motivational 
interviewing, 
cogni-
tive–behavioural therapy (CBT) and psychopharmacological 
consultation.24 Other treatments that reported positive effects 
included a physiotherapy programme,25 26 cognitive therapies,27 
medical treatments using amitriptyline,28 amantadine,29 periph-
eral nerve blocks (including greater occipital nerve blocks)30 and 
exercise interventions including submaximal aerobic training 
in children31 32 and adults.33–36 Individuals who performed the 
greatest activity level were found to have worse performance in 
visual memory, but not other cognitive domains, in one study.37 
No difference was seen in symptoms or clinical recovery when 
participants were exposed to a symptom-free waiting period 
prior to returning to play.38 39
In summary, there is moderate evidence that targeted cervical 
and vestibular physiotherapy is more effective than typical rest 
followed by graded exertion to facilitate medical clearance to 
return to sport. There is limited evidence that collaborative 
care (including CBT, psychopharmacological consultation and 
care management) reduces symptoms and improves health-re-
lated quality of life in youth. There is conflicting evidence 
that subsymptom threshold aerobic exercise decreases time 
 
to recovery; however, the majority of literature suggests a 
positive effect. There is no evidence to minimal evidence that 
medical treatments are of benefit to facilitate recovery following 
concussion.
DISCuSSIon
Most consensus and agreement statements for managing SRC4 40 
41 recommend that athletes rest until they become symptom-free. 
Accordingly, prescribed rest is one of the most widely used inter-
ventions in this population.42–45 At least three rationales for rest 
have been articulated. First, rest probably mitigates postcon-
cussion symptoms, easing discomfort during the acute recovery 
period. Second, rest might promote recovery by minimising 
energy demands during haemodynamic and neurometabolic 
restoration following concussion.46–48 Third, athletes are at an 
increased risk for sustaining a recurrent concussion within the 
first 7–10 days after the initial concussion.38 A repeat concussion

Review
during this period of recovery might have a magnified effect.49–51 
Note that this last rationale for rest is for restricting sport partici-
pation and other preinjury activities with an elevated concussion 
risk rather than for restricting all usual activities (ie, complete 
rest).
There is currently insufficient evidence that prescribing 
complete rest facilitates recovery following SRC. Observational 
studies report mixed findings regarding whether physical or 
mental activity during the days to weeks after SRC are associated 
with faster or slower recovery times.15 16 19 20 37 Student athletes 
reported fewer symptoms and performed better on cognitive 
testing following a week of prescribed rest.13 14 However, the 
high risk of bias in these uncontrolled and non-randomised 
studies leaves doubt as to whether the positive outcomes were 
attributable to prescribed rest versus pre-existing differences, 
natural recovery, expectations/placebo effects or other thera-
peutic aspects of the clinical encounter.
There is limited higher quality evidence from RCTs that 
recruited athletes and non-athletes from an emergency depart-
ment. In an RCT involving adults with concussions due to 
mostly (90%) non-sport causes, prescribing 6 days of complete 
rest (versus encouraging patients to mobilise and limit their bed 
rest starting on the day after injury) was associated with less 
dizziness in the first 4 days but bed rest was not associated with a 
meaningful difference in clinical outcomes at 2 weeks, 3 months 
or 6 months following injury.52 Adolescents with concussion 
who were prescribed complete rest for 5 days reported more 
symptoms over the 10-day observational period compared 
with adolescents who received usual care, typically including 
advice to rest for 1–2 days.12 The two groups performed simi-
larly on balance and cognition outcomes. Of note, adherence to 
prescribed complete rest was modest in both these trials, which 
may have contributed to the small differences between the inter-
vention groups. This also highlights the practical challenges of 
implementing prescribed rest. In children, self-reported physical 
activity within 7 days of concussion was associated with reduced 
risk of persistent postconcussive symptoms at 28 days following 
injury.53
In summary, the best available evidence from clinical studies 
does not support the efficacy of prescribing complete rest for 
more than a few days after SRC. Both observational and exper-
imental laboratory studies have demonstrated that bouts of 
intense physical or mental activity can exacerbate symptoms 
in concussed athletes.54–58 These exacerbations appear to be 
transient54 58 59 and further research is needed to understand 
the underlying pathophysiology and potential impact on long-
term outcomes. In the interim, athletes can be encouraged to 
gradually resume their non-sport activities as tolerated, avoiding 
heavy exertion and activities that have an elevated concussion 
risk until they are medically cleared. Prescribing rest for more

Review
than a few days should be weighed against the possible harms 
of prolonged activity restriction, especially in elite sports.60–62 
However, shortening the rest period should not necessarily mean 
rapid return to sport. Timing of return to sport remains a chal-
lenge especially given the evidence for a period of vulnerability 
to reinjury in some athletes following concussion and should be 
guided by a multimodal clinical assessment.
Treatment: rehabilitation
Historically, rest followed by a protocol of graded exertion has 
been the treatment of choice following SRC.4 6 However, a more 
active approach to rehabilitation may be of benefit.7 25 31–34 63 
64 Our systematic review identified five studies that evaluated 
rehabilitative techniques following concussion, one of which 
was an RCT evaluating multimodal physiotherapy treatment 
(DB score 25), one RCT evaluating collaborative care (DB score 
19) and three case series evaluating cognitive rehab (DB score 
12) and multifaceted physical therapy and exercise (DB score 9 
and 11). For individuals with persisting symptoms of dizziness, 
neck pain and headaches, a combination of cervical and vestib-
ular rehabilitation has positive treatment effects in both youth 
and young adults compared with standard care (rest followed by 
graded exertion).21 Treatment was individualised and was based 
on persisting impairments in cervical and vestibular function.21
Multifaceted physiotherapy treatment regimes that include 
adaptation, balance, musculoskeletal, aerobic, anaerobic and 
sport-specific exercises might be useful.25 26 However, poor 
methods (including poor description of the endpoint of return 
to full activity) limit the conclusions that can be drawn.
There is a large body of evidence demonstrating positive treat-
ment effects with vestibular rehabilitation for individuals with 
vestibular disorders.65–67 Vestibular rehabilitation is safe and 
effective for peripheral vestibular disorders including unilateral 
peripheral vestibular hypofunction and benign paroxysmal posi-
tional vertigo.65–68 Additionally, studies evaluating the effects of 
vestibular rehabilitation have demonstrated positive symptom-
atic and functional improvements in patients who have suffered 
mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) of all types, including blast 
injuries.69–71 Thus, vestibular rehabilitation may be appropriate 
for individuals with persistent vestibular findings following SRC.
A combination of specific exercises and manual therapy that 
focus on function is effective for improving pain and function 
in individuals with cervical spine pain and cervicogenic head-
aches.72 Thus, inclusion of exercise and manual therapy in the 
case of ongoing cervical spine pain and cervicogenic headaches 
following concussion may be of benefit.
For individuals with mTBI, there is some evidence to support 
the use of an educational pamphlet73 74 and CBT.75–78 A recent 
RCT that employed a multifaceted collaborative treatment 
protocol including motivational interviewing, school accom-
modations, CBT and psychopharmacological therapy (where 
indicated) identified a positive treatment effect on postcon-
cussive symptoms and health-related quality of life.24 Further 
research to determine the efficacy of rehabilitative strategies 
evaluating other areas that may be affected by SRC such as 
cognition, mood, psychological disorders, sleep disturbance and 
others, in isolation as well as in combination, is required.
Treatment: exercise
In articles included in our systematic review, concussed male and 
female athletes with persistent symptoms lasting between 1 and 
12 months were typically introduced to subsymptom submaximal 
(light) aerobic exercise multiple times per week. Overall, oursys-
tematic review supports the notion that controlled exercise 
performed at an intensity and duration that does not exacer-
bate symptoms is likely safe and beneficial for adult athletes 
with persistent symptoms following concussion. Athletes in the 
submaximal exercise groups typically reported fewer symptoms, 
recovered to baseline on cognitive and balance scores faster, and 
in one study34 demonstrated more efficient activation patterns 
on functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) relative 
to matched controls. One RCT in adolescents demonstrated a 
positive treatment effect with subsymptom exacerbation aerobic 
training on symptom ratings; however, poorer adherence to 
exercise was reported in the aerobic training group compared 
with the stretching group.79 The other RCT demonstrated no 
difference between groups in time to recovery.80
Studies involving children and adolescent athletes experiencing 
symptoms for at least 4 weeks following concussion showed 
similar improvements after completion of a progressive rehabil-
itation programme.31 32 All young athletes returned to a normal 
lifestyle and full sport participation. While more robust RCTs 
are needed, these findings suggest that closely monitored active 
rehabilitation programmes involving controlled subsymptom 
threshold, submaximal exercise for adults and adolescents with 
persistent symptoms after concussion may be of benefit.
Treatment: medical
Three studies on medical treatment of SRC were identified. All 
studies were retrospective case series with moderate risk of bias 
scores. T
wo of the studies described the treatment of post-trau-
matic headaches (PTH) with either interventional or traditional 
pharmacological measures. There is limited evidence to support 
various medical management strategies for SRC, including the 
treatment of PTH. There are no available data from RCTs eval-
uating the therapeutic efficacy of medical interventions specific to 
PTH (in athletes or otherwise), although a small number of case 
reports and cohort studies have recently been published. The data 
from studies suggesting that certain pharmacotherapeutics may be 
effective treatment strategies in the context of PTH have not shown 
that medical intervention hastens recovery following SRC.28 81 82
Treatment: other (symptom-free waiting period)
The results of the two studies evaluating the effects of a symp-
tom-free waiting period suggest that outcomes, such as risk of 
reinjury, may be more closely associated with an initial period 
of vulnerability to reinjury than with apparent symptom resolu-
tion. Therefore, these findings highlight the importance of injury 
recognition and prudent return to play decision making by clini-
cians during the first 10 days after SRC.
T
wo RCTs in our review included interventions that involved 
more than one type of treatment and demonstrated positive 
effects.24 63 Because concussion is an injury with heterogeneous 
symptom and functional presentations of patients, multifaceted 
rehabilitation protocols may be of benefit to facilitate recovery. 
Further research in this area is needed.
limitations
Most of the studies included in this review were of low meth-
odological quality and biased by systematic errors. Our review 
may be subject to a publication bias. This review may be subject 
to a language bias as we only included articles published in the 
English language. We only included studies that evaluated rest or 
treatment for SRC. There may be other treatments of potential

benefit that have been evaluated in this population but were not 
identified by our inclusion criteria.
Suggestions for future research
The current literature contains few high-quality studies and 
many of the current studies included in this review have a high 
risk of bias. Future studies should evaluate the optimal timing, 
mode, duration, intensity and frequency of treatment during 
the postacute time period following concussion, ideally through 
RCTs, where feasible. To facilitate research and improve the 
clinical care of PTH, use of the International Classification of 
Headache Disorders (ICHD) 3 beta standardised criteria is pref-
erable due to its precise classification methods. Further research 
evaluating rest and active treatments should be performed using 
high-quality designs that account for potential confounding 
factors and effect modifiers.
ConCluSIon
After a brief period (24–48 
hours) of complete rest, patients can 
be encouraged to become gradually and progressively more active 
while staying below their cognitive and physical symptom exacerba-
tion thresholds. Athletes should avoid heavy exertion and activities 
with an elevated risk of head injury while they are recovering. The 
exact amount and duration of rest is not yet well defined.
A variety of treatments may be required for ongoing symp-
toms and impairments following concussion. Interventions 
including cervical and vestibular rehabilitation (for individuals 
with persisting dizziness, cervical spine pain and headaches) and 
closely monitored active rehabilitation programmes involving 
controlled subsymptom threshold, submaximal exercise could be 
considered. Specific treatment recommendations can be directed 
based on clinical examination findings and symptoms.

What is already known?
 
► An initial period of cognitive and physical rest following 
concussion is recommended—followed by a progression of 
gradually increasing activity.
 
► The literature evaluating the effects of treatment following 
concussion is limited.
What are the new findings?
 
► The exact amount and duration of rest is not yet well 
defined.
 
► After a brief period (24–48 hours) of complete rest, patients 
can be encouraged to become gradually and progressively 
more active while staying below their cognitive and physical 
symptom exacerbation thresholds.
 
► Research supports interventions including cervical and 
vestibular rehabilitation (for individuals with persisting 
dizziness, cervical spine painand headaches). Closely 
monitored active rehabilitation programmes involving 
subsymptom threshold and submaximal exercise are safe 
and may facilitate recovery. Multifaceted collaborative 
treatments (including cognitive–behavioural therapy, school 
accommodations and pharmacotherapy) may also be of 
benefit.
