Abstract
We demonstrate the rapid and label-free capture of breast cancer cells spiked in blood using
nanotube-antibody micro-arrays. 76-element single wall carbon nanotube arrays were
manufactured using photo-lithography, metal deposition, and etching techniques. Anti-epithelial
cell adhesion molecule (anti-EpCAM), Anti-human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (anti-
Her2) and non-specific IgG antibodies were functionalized to the surface of the nanotube devices
using 1-pyrene-butanoic acid succinimidyl ester. Following device functionalization, blood
spiked with SKBR3, MCF7 and MCF10A cells (100/1000 cells per 5 μl per device, 170
elements totaling 0.85 ml of whole blood) were adsorbed on to the nanotube device arrays.
Electrical signatures were recorded from each device to screen the samples for differences in
interaction (specific or non-specific) between samples and devices. A zone classification scheme
enabled the classification of all 170 elements in a single map. A kernel-based statistical classifier
for the ‘liquid biopsy’ was developed to create a predictive model based on dynamic time
warping series to classify device electrical signals that corresponded to plain blood (control) or
SKBR3 spiked blood (case) on anti-Her2 functionalized devices with ∼90% sensitivity, and 90%
specificity in capture of 1000 SKBR3 breast cancer cells in blood using anti-Her2 functionalized
devices. Screened devices that gave positive electrical signatures were confirmed using optical/

were classified to hold spiked blood based on their electrical signatures confirmed the presence
of cancer cells through staining for DAPI (nuclei), cytokeratin (cancer cells) and CD45
(hematologic cells) with single cell sensitivity. We report 55%–100% cancer cell capture yield
depending on the active device area for blood adsorption with mean of 62% (∼12 500 captured
off 20 000 spiked cells in 0.1 ml blood) in this first nanotube–CTC chip study.

1. Introduction
In 1869, Thomas Ashworth first observed circulating tumor
cells (CTCs) in the blood of a man with metastatic cancer
using an optical microscope. He postulated that ‘cells iden-
tical with those of the cancer itself being seen in the blood
may tend to throw some light upon the mode of origin of
multiple tumors existing in the same person’ [1]. A thorough
comparison of the morphology of the circulating cells to
tumor cells from different lesions led Ashworth to conclude
that ‘One thing is certain, that if they (CTC) came from an
existing cancer structure, they must have passed through the
greater part of the circulatory system to have arrived at the
internal saphena vein of the sound leg’ [1]. Since then tumor
derived cells have been recognized as being present in the
circulatory system and number of studies were conducted in
the 1950s on CTC detection in peripheral blood [2, 3]. While
PCR techniques greatly enhanced the detection of CTCs in
1990s for various cancers, [4–8], the advancement in micro-
fluidic cell capture technologies led to a new paradigm of
‘liquid biopsy’ that made the isolation, enumeration and study
of CTCs possible in large volumes of blood.
The field of isolation and study of CTCs has been
growing with many types of devices reported in the recent
past based on immunomagnetic methods [9–11], microfluidic
chips [12, 13], laser scanning cytometry [14], high-through-
put optical-imaging systems [15] fiber optic array scanning
technology [16] and nano-Velcro [17] arrays. Each method
has advantages and disadvantages in isolation of CTCs. For
example, the immunomagnetic methods, while automated,
suffer from loss of CTCs, which requires definition of the
number of cells captured versus survival in weeks/months
[9]. Microfluidic techniques used for CTC isolation, while
impressive, are flow rate dependent and require off-chip post-
processing [12, 13]. The first generation CTC-chip enabled a
capture yield of 25% (at 3 ml h−1 flow rate) to 65% (at
1 ml h−1) depending on how slowly the blood is processed
[12]. To improve yield a herringbone chip was invented that
yielded ∼80% capture yield at ∼0.12 ml h−1 flow rate and
∼40% capture yield at flow rate of ∼0.48 ml h−1 [13]. Static
isolation of CTCs from blood through fractionation of blood
into small droplets in a micro-array format has not been
investigated for CTC isolation. We report this concept below.
There are several advantages to the static isolation and
enumeration method: (1) micro-array format enabling a large
volume of blood to be fractionated into smaller portions that
may enable better capture sensitivity and enable verifiable and
reproducible results as well as the ability to scale the number
of sensors; (2) the nanotube-micro-arrays include both
detection and capture technology unlike microfluidics which
only captures; (3) a wide variety of antibodies can be func-
tionalized on the same nanotube micro-array using 1-pyrene-
butanoic acid succinimidyl ester (PASE) functionalization
that can fish out CTCs overexpressing different receptors; (4)
classification of the detected electrical signals using kernel-
based dynamic time warping (DTW) classifiers with high
sensitivity and specificity; (5) transfer of cells is not required
to do further microscopic analysis thereby minimizing loss of
CTCs; (6) the design is tunable to capturing 1–80 000 indi-
vidual cells/22 500 cell clusters per device by changing the
ratio of the area of the active region of the pad to the droplet
area; (7) the entire assembly can be automated into a compact
handheld device or a laboratory based instrument similar to
the immunomagnetic methods of enrichment and capture [9–
11]; (8) the captured cells are viable, enabling downstream
molecular analysis such as qPCR. These excellent char-
acteristics are encouraging to develop static micro-array
isolation of CTCs from blood. We describe the proof-of-
concept study in this paper using spiked breast cancer cells in
blood.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. CNT-network formation
The first step in the process is assembling the nanotube net-
work. Iso-semiconducting single wall carbon nanotubes
(SWNTs) were purchased from Nanointegris LLC. The
manufacturer
specified
diameter
was
in
the
range
of
1.2–1.7 nm and length was in the range of 100 nm–4 μm.
Nanotubes were suspended in surfactant solution at 1 mg/
100 ml as received. 600 μl of the stock solution was then
mixed with 85 ml of DI water and 15 ml of 1% w/v sodium
dodecyl sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. No. 436143), for a final
concentration of 6 μg/100 ml.

 2.2. Vacuum filtration
The 100 ml solution was vacuum filtered over a cellulose
membrane, 0.05 μm pore size (Millipore, No. VMWP09025).
The vacuum filtration method self-regulates the deposition
rate of nanotubes on the membrane to produce an evenly
distributed conductive network. The CNT film network was
then pressed onto a dry oxidized (300 nm thickness) 4″ silicon
wafer for 30 min. Next the wafer was transferred to an acet-
one vapor bath that dissolved the overlaying filter membrane.
2.3. Clean room processing
Patterning of the nanotube film and electrode and insulating
layer fabrication were done by photolithography in the
cleanroom. The S1813 photoresist was used to mask the
nanotube film areas needed for the sensor elements. Exposed
nanotubes were etched away in a March reactive ion etcher
for 90 s at 200 W power and
pressure of 200mTorr. The
S1813 photoresist was also used to mask the electrode pat-
tern. Electrodes, 15 nm Ni and a 90 nm Au layers, were
deposited by sputtering in a Leskar PVD 75 system, 300 W
DC power. The lift-off process was conducted in an acetone
bath to remove the excess Ni/Au layers. Lastly, the sensors
were covered with SU8-2005, a 5 μm thick photopolymer
layer. A window over each of the nanotube sensor elements
was developed, but the electrodes remain insulated beneath
the SU8.
2.4. Device functionalization
Finished carbon nanotube sensors were functionalized with
anti-EpCAM, anti-Her2 and IgG by a pyrene linker molecule.
The pyrene rings of 1-pyrenebutanoic acid, succinimidyl ester
adsorb onto carbon nanotube sidewalls by π-stacking. The
ester on the other end of the molecule provided an attachment
point for antibodies. PASE (AnaSpec, Cat. No. 81238) was
dissolved in methanol at 1 mM. Devices were incubated in the
PASE solution for 2 h at room temperature, and then rinsed
with methanol and dried using a nitrogen air gun. Devices
were then incubated in Anti-EpCAM (EMD Bioscience, Cat.
No. OP187), anti-HER-2 (Cell Signaling tech., Cat. No
2242S), or IgG (EMD Millipore, Cat. No. 411550), 20 μg
ml−1 in 1X PBS, for 2 h at room temperature. After incuba-
tion, devices were rinsed in 1X PBS three times. Tween20
was used to block unfunctionalized nanotube sidewalls to
minimize non-specific interactions. Devices were incubated
with 0.5% Tween20 for 2 h at room temperature. After
incubation, devices were rinsed with 1X PBS, then incubated
in 20 μl droplets of 1X PBS overnight in a humid chamber at
4°C before testing.
2.5. Cell culture and preparation
The breast adenocarcinoma cell lines MCF7 and SKBR3
(ATCC, Cat. No. HTB-22; HTB-30), was cultured under
conditions as recommended by ATCC. MCF10A (ATCC,
Cat. No. CRL-10317) is a non-tumorigenic cell line that is
EpCAM negative, while MCF7 and SKBR3 are EpCAM
positive cell lines. SKBR3 is a Her2 positive cell line. Cells
were grown for 3–4 d to reach ∼80% confluence (figure S1,
online supplementary information). Cells were then detached
from the culture flask using Accutase enzyme solution
(Sigma, Cat. No. A6964), centrifuged and suspended in 1X
PBS buffer solution and taken for counting using a hemo-
cytometer as presented in figure S1 (online supplementary
information). Finally cells for each cell line were prepared at
fixed concentrations of 800 000 cells ml−1 and 80 000 cells ml−1
in 1X PBS solution. Next the cell samples were diluted 1:3 in
blood for a final spiked cell concentration of 1000 cells/5 μl
and 100 cells/5 μl. At this stage spiked blood samples were
stored at 4 °C for same day testing. As test samples were
injected onto the device at fixed volumes of 5 μl, the total
number of the spiked cells injected to each device was fixed at
1000 or 100 accordingly.
2.6. Blood sample preparation
Blood was donated by the first author (FK) of this paper and
was the subject of all blood draws. Blood samples used are all
traced back to FK as the only source and sole blood donor.
This allowed for a control and identified blood source with
the least degree of variation in each batch of blood samples.
Upon receiving approval from Worcester Polytechnic Insti-
tute’s
(WPI)
Institutional
Review
Board
(IRB),
IRB#00007374,
and
completing
biosafety,
blood-borne
pathogen, and standard microbiological practices trainings,
the following protocol was developed under the guidance of
Environmental Health and Safety department at WPI to col-
lect and handle blood samples for the purposes of the
experiments presented here. As the blood sample volume
defined for each set of testing are set at 5 μl, the total blood
volume needed for each day of testing did not exceed 100 μl.
Therefore, the blood draw protocol was generated around the
volumes needed to minimize biohazardous waste generation
and to maintain the health of the blood donor as the blood
draws had to be executed frequently throughout the 21 d of
testing. As a result, capillary sampling protocol provided by
World Health Organization (WHO), ‘WHO guidelines on
drawing blood: best practices in phlebotomy’, was adopted to
generate a protocol to collect blood samples from a finger tip
of the subject as presented in figure S2 (online supplementary
information). PBS or CTC spiked PBS were diluted 1:3 into
collected blood, as described above. This dilution protocol
prevented the blood from clotting without the addition of any
additional chemicals and allowed for determining an exact
concentration of spiked CTCs levels in each sample. Blood
sample preparation steps are shown in figure S2 (online
supplementary information).
2.7. Confocal microscopy
After experimental data had been collected, the devices were
saved and taken for staining and confocal imaging. The
devices were first rinsed with PBS to remove excess cells and
fragments and then incubated with 4% paraformaldehyde
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Cat. No. sc-281692). After
3
Nanotechnology 27 (2016) 44LT03
 initial preparation devices were stained with DAPI (Molecular
Probes, Cat. No. D1306), anti-cytokeratin (CK19) (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Cat. No. sc-33119) and anti-CD45
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Cat. No. sc-1187) according
to the standard confocal staining protocol. A coverslip was
placed on top of each device and sealed before imaging.
Confocal laser scanning microscopy images were obtained on
a Nikon Eclipse T with coverslip corrected objective focused
at 600X.
2.8. Device testing
The testing platform was set up on Signatone probe station.
An Agilent 4156C semiconductor parameter analyzer equip-
ped with a custom LabVIEW interface was used for mon-
itoring the sensors and data collection. A 100 mV DC bias
was applied to source electrodes and 0 V VG was applied
using a Ag/AgCl reference electrode via the sample droplet,
The source–drain current, ISD, was recorded for the duration
of the test. The accuracy of the semiconductor parameter
analyzer is 1 fA. The entire probe station assembly is placed
on an optical table that is vibration isolated using air on all
four legs. A metal box covers the entire assembly to avoid
electromagnetic interference. The probes are connected to the
parameter analyzer using a triaxial cable that is EM shielded.
Throughout the testing the devices were maintained inside a
humidified chamber to prevent evaporation of the sample
droplet. The testing protocol started with a hydrated device
topped by a 20 μl droplet of 1X PBS, which was placed
immediately after functionalization. The bias was applied, and
the sensor was monitored for the initial 4 min, then 5 μl
droplets of the sample solution, plain or spiked blood, were
pipetted directly into the standing 20 μl 1X PBS droplets.
Devices were monitored for 360 s after addition of the sample
solution. The total duration of one test was 10 min long. To
compare results among devices, ISD data were normalized to
obtain the G/G0 values for conductance. The sensor element
was also imaged on an optical microscope to confirm the
presence of cancer cells. The spiked donor blood samples
consisted of 100 or 1000 MCF7/SKBR3/MCF10A cells per
5 μl per device for these experiments. The surface of the CNT
device is capable of interacting with over 20 000 cells at one
time, therefore fully capable of capturing 1000 or 100 spiked
cells.
2.9. Statistical classifier
Statistical classification was done using DTW package in R.
The sensitivity, specificity, and misclassification rate were
then computed, considering spiked blood to be a positive test
and normal blood to be a negative test. Sensitivity is defined
as TP/P where TP denotes the number of positive test out-
comes, and P denotes the number of true positives. Specificity
is defined as TN/N where TN denotes the number of negative
test outcomes, and N denotes the number of true negatives.
3. Results
3.1. The nanotube–CTC chip
Here, we describe a new philosophy in efficient capture of
spiked cancer cells in blood using carbon nanotube micro-
arrays (‘Nanotube–CTC chip’). The chip consists of a 76-
element array of carbon nanotube devices that are functio-
nalized with anti-epithelial-cell-adhesion-molecule (EpCAM),
anti-human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (anti-Her2) and
non-specific immunoglobin (IgG) antibodies. EpCAM is
frequently overexpressed by carcinomas of breast, lung,
prostate, colon, head and neck, and is absent from hemato-
logic cells [18–20]. Similarly, Her2 is overexpressed in
aggressive breast cancer and is prime candidate for targeted
therapy and is absent from hematologic cells [21, 22]. For
comparison, a non-specific IgG antibody was also functio-
nalized to distinguish between specific and non-specific
interactions.
The nanotube–CTC chip incorporates both detection and
capture technology. The semiconducting nanotubes with
PASE functionalized antibodies, when in contact with cells,
create a change in electrical signature, which is recorded [23].
Figure 1 presents the schematic of the sensing technique.
Biomolecular reactions are driven thermodynamically by
the reduction in free energy of the system. For specific
interactions, the reduction in free energy is higher than non-
specific interactions [24]. One can use a spectrum of energy
domains to transduce the change in the free energy of the
specific interactions into mechanics, electricity, thermal or
magnetism [24]. The measurement of specific versus non-
specific binding events in cells as electrical spikes in a fast
manner and the ability to stratify them rapidly in blood using
DTW is a new method that enables both detection and capture
on chip.

(negative ΔG is favorable).
Since the reduction in free energy is universal for specific
and non-specific pairs, we hypothesize that this should be true
for detection of specific versus non-specific interactions in
cells. Extracellular overexpressed receptors, namely EpCAM
and Her2, in breast cancer cells interact with the anti-EpCAM
and anti-Her2 antibodies on the nanotube surface. The
cooperative specific interaction of thousands of extracellular
receptors with specific antibodies on nanotube surface creates
spikes in the normalized electrical conductance versus time
[23, 25–27]. Most CTC isolation technologies described
before use anti-EpCAM antibodies to target the EpCAM
receptor for cell capture and thus are examples of specific
interaction. Capturing cells based on both EpCAM and Her2
can optimize CTC capture efficiency for breast cancer, as
EpCAM expression in CTCs may be transient and dependent
upon the local micro-environment [19]. Non-specific samples
such as plain blood also create such spikes in the electrical
conductance versus time data, with much lower slopes. The
philosophy behind this work is whether such spikes in the
signals could carry meaningful information about the sample
4

 condition/interaction that could then be analyzed using
microscopy of captured CTCs [23].
In the nanotube CTC chip we have identified three dif-
ferent electrical signals: (1) the characteristic signals are
classified as specific interactions that give rise to an increase
in signal conductance followed by saturation at higher level of
conductance; (2) non-specific interactions are characterized
by a decrease in electrical signal or (3) no change in con-
ductance, or at the same level as buffer. This type of classi-
fication enabled us to analytically distinguish between devices
that showed positive versus negative responses in an array. A
kernel-based classifier employing DTW was then used to
classify the signatures that represented specific versus non-
specific interactions [23]. These were classified with ∼90%
sensitivity and ∼90% specificity in classifying devices spe-
cifically based on Her2 signatures for spiked SKBR3 (breast
adenocarcinoma) cells in blood. While the classification is
used to screen devices, the capture of cells is based on static
isolation in a micro-array format followed by microscopy
on chip.
The nanotube–CTC-chip uses static isolation technique
for the capture of CTCs. At the heart of the chip is the 76-
element micro-array that is fabricated using vacuum filtration
and film formation of carbon nanotubes [28], clean room
processing to form the micro-arrays with independently
addressable electrical contacts, and SU8 layer passivation of
the devices to expose only the active nanotube elements [23].
Figure 2(a) presents the optical image of the 76-element
arrays, and figure 2(b) presents the array with the blood
droplet spots. The source, reference and drain electrodes are
identified. Figure 2(c) presents the schematic of the electrical
test set-up for measuring change in conductance. Finally,
figures 2(d) and (e) presents the test-setup with the sample on
the probe station; the chip sits inside a chamber to prevent
sample evaporation.
The arrays are fabricated using lithography, reactive ion
etching and post-processing. These are described fully in our
previous report [23]. We have fabricated three generations of
devices consisting of 60-element, 76-element and 240-ele-
ment arrays. With a 3 mm×3 mm device size and at the rate
of 5–20 μl per device, the 76-element arrays can process
anywhere from ∼0.3 to 4.8 ml of blood, large enough to get
meaningful information about the sample condition. Here we
have used a total of ∼0.85 ml of blood and 170 elements, each
analyzing 5 μl per device, in order to get a variety of infor-
mation from this array using different antibodies. Past studies
indicate circulating breast cancer cells in patients at a reported
range of 50–300 000 ml [14, 29, 30], so, a drop of 5–30 μl
would be expected to contain 1–9000 epithelial cells. It has
also been reported that 1 g of tumor tissue (109 cells) sheds
about 3–4×106 tumor cells into the blood stream per day
and thus presents clinical value in their enumeration [31]. The
spike concentration of cells was chosen to be relevant to the
upper limit of clinical samples, and as a proof of concept of
this static isolation approach. The surface of the CNT device
is capable of capturing over 80 000 individual cells/22 500
cell clusters at one time, therefore fully capable of capturing
100–1000 spiked cells. Similarly, arrays can be automated to
handle more than 100 elements at the same time to enable
results within minutes.
The chip consisting of the 76-element array of CNT
micro devices was specifically designed for the need to pro-
cess considerably large volumes of blood compared to the
previous generation 60-element array where the active area
was only 100 μm×80 μm [23]. Each device in the 76-ele-
ment array is 3 mm×3 mm and can hold about 20 μl of
blood. A larger CNT film area was elected to accommodate
Figure 1. Schematic of the device for capture of cells spiked in blood.

 these tests. Similar to the first generation of CNT arrays [23],
the 76-element second generation device consists of a simple
two-terminal design at their core with a CNT ultra-thin film
network connecting the source and drain electrodes. In this
design, the sensing channel consists of a CNT network con-
necting the two electrodes, 3000 μm in length and 3000 μm in
width. As a result, the sensing area of each device is
´
9
106 μm2, allowing for ∼80 000 cells, assuming an aver-
age 10–12 μm diameter, to be captured on the device. The
sensing area becomes critical when we are considering pro-
cessing blood samples due to their heterogeneity. CTCs are
only slightly larger than leukocytes and therefore one needs to

 distinguish between them using microscopic techniques. One
intriguing and unexpected observation we made in the static
isolation device, is that blood cell types in the sample/droplet
settle differentially due to the forces of gravity and surface
texture, resulting in cells coming in contact and interacting
with the carbon nanotube surface. Two elements that deter-
mine the cancer cell capture efficiency are the size of the
droplet and the size of the active area of the device and the
hydrophobicity of the CNT film. The ratio between the areas
can enable tunable design of devices to capture a specific
number of cells both in large and small volumes. The
hydrophobicity of the CNT film can result in localization of
the droplet. The initial observations on the optical microscope
of cancer cell spiked blood sample droplets on top of the
devices (as presented in later part of the paper) showed that
the spiked cancer cells as part of their settling process bind
directly on top of the CNT network established on silicon
dioxide substrate, under a layer of red blood cells (RBCs).
This differential settling phenomenon opened avenues to
further attempts achieving better efficiency of spiked cancer
cell capture in blood by functionalizing the nanotubes.
The 76-element array of nanotube devices used for the
testing in blood were fabricated using a 6 μg CNT film. Past
devices on 60-element arrays were fabricated using 4 μg film
with an active area of 100 μm×80 μm which gave a uniform
distribution of the CNT network [23]. A higher relative film
concentration was selected for the 76-element array devices
with respect to the device size, 3 mm×3 mm, to maintain a
uniform, continuous, and conductive CNT network. The
fabrication process and the characterization of devices with
these CNT films are discussed elsewhere [23]. The nanotube
elements are highly purified semiconducting CNT (Iso-
semiconducting nanotubes, NanoIntegris LLC). The CNT
devices had an average resistance of 0.2 MΩ after annealing,
and average mobility was calculated for these thin film
devices
as
∼4.95 cm2 V−1 s−1,
with
a
bandgap
of
0.26–0.5 eV. The on–off ratio was determined for these
devices using both back-gating configuration, Ion/Ioff=11.2
(figure S3 in the online supplementary information), and also
with electrolyte liquid-gating configuration Ion/Ioff=134
(figure S3 in the online supplementary information). The on–
off ratio decreases with increasing CNT mass and the mobi-
lity increases. The results suggest that there is an inherent
trade-off between the on–off ratio and mobilities with
increasing CNT mass. These suggest high quality of nano-
tubes and thin film transistor characteristics, in line with
previous reports [28, 32].
3.2. Chemical functionalization
In the past, CTC capture techniques have relied on chemical
functionalization of antibodies such as anti-EpCAM on top of
microbeads [9–11] or microposts [12, 13]. Here we used
carbon nanotubes that are highly compatible with functiona-
lization chemistry to manufacture our devices. The nanotube
device elements are chemically functionalized using sidewall
PASE functionalization [33]. The side wall functionalization
enables access to the π orbitals of the carbon nanotubes. The
strong π–π interactions between the pyrene fragment of the
PASE molecule and the nanotube surface creates a method for
stable functionalization of carbon nanotubes [34]. The pyrene
rings of the PASE adsorb on to the sidewalls of the SWNT
through π stacking and produce a stable nanotube-PASE
composite [23]. The succinimidyl ester on the other end of the
PASE provides the attachment site for the antibodies [23].
Pyrene interacts strongly with the surface of carbon nanotubes
of different chiralities, but the interaction with zigzag nano-
tubes (semiconducting) is stronger than with armchair
(metallic) ones of the same diameter [34]. Recent work by our
group has studied the gold nanoparticle targeting of carbon
nanotube surface using PASE functionalization in detail and
has shown the viability of using this method for antibody
attachment and targeting cancer cells in buffy coats [23]. In
this study we used the same functionalization method for
antibody functionalization and testing in blood. Overall, the
PASE enables sidewall functionalization, the ester provides
attachment to the antibodies and enables stability over many
weeks. Functionalized devices can be kept at 4 °C for 1–2
weeks and still maintain the integrity of the functionalization
process.
3.3. Design of experiments
There are two main variables within the design of experiment
in the array, sample type (plain blood and blood spiked with
MCF7 (mammary gland adenocarcinoma), MCF10A (normal
human
mammary
cells),
or
SKBR3
(mammary
gland

 adenocarcinoma) cells and device type (IgG, anti-HER-2, or
anti-EpCAM antibody functionalized device). In addition,
two cell concentrations were defined for each cell spiked
sample type, 100 or 1000 cells per 5 μl. Table 1 presents the
design of experiments and the number of replicates. Over all
there were 10 replicates for each combination, 10 replicates
for 100 cells and 10 replicates for 1000 cells for each type of
cancer cell spiking. Three cell lines of SKBR3, positive
control (over expressing HER-2), MCF7, positive control
(overexpressing EpCAM), and MCF10A, negative control
normal epithelial cell line (not overexpressing HER2 or
EpCAM), were cultured and prepared for these experiments.
In addition to these three spiked cell types, plain non-spiked
blood was also tested as the fourth sample type, a negative
control, with each device type.
CNT devices were divided into three groups; the first
batch was functionalized with anti-HER2 antibody, the sec-
ond batch was functionalized with anti-EpCAM antibody, and
the third batch was functionalized with non-specific IgG
antibody via PASE linker molecule as presented in figure 3
[23]. Tween-20 non-ionic detergent was adsorbed after
functionalization to minimize non-specific adsorption to the
non-functionalized CNT surface [23]. Figure 3 illustrates the
variations of CNT device functionalization and sample types.
In these experiments, there are 17 unique combinations within
sample types, device functionalization, and cell concentration,
with 170 technical array replicates, each holding 5 μl drops,
resulting in 0.85 ml of blood processed in our array. Four
combinations were designed as positive cases with specific
interactions expected (SKBR3 spiked blood versus HER2
functionalized CNT device and MCF7 spiked blood versus
EpCAM functionalized CNT device, both at 100 and 1000
cell concentrations), with 40 overall replicates, shown in blue
in table 1. Thirteen other combinations shown in red were
designed as negative controls (not spiked) or positive controls
with non-specific interactions expected (SKBR-3 spiked
blood versus IgG).
3.4. Electrical detection and zone classification scheme
Figure 4 presents the electrical sensing from specific and non-
specific interactions in blood. Three types of signals were
identified. SKBR3 spiked blood that was adsorbed on anti-
Her2 antibody device produced a characteristic device sig-
nature with increase in signal conductance (figure 4(a)).
Similarly, MCF7 cells spiked in blood and adsorbed on anti-
EpCAM nanotube surface produced a rise in signal con-
ductance (shown in figure 5). On the contrary, MCF10A cells
spiked in blood produced a characteristic device signature that
was either no change or led to a decrease in electrical signal
(figure 4(b)). Finally, plain blood adsorption on the anti-Her2
functionalized device produced a decrease in the device
electrical signal or stayed at the buffer level suggesting no
change (figure 4(c)). The specific and non-specific signals
were visually classified into these three groups: (1) ‘Zone1’ or
an increase in the device electrical signal; (2) ‘Zone 2’ or no
change and (3) ‘Zone 3’, decrease in device electrical signal.
Figure 5 presents electrical signatures of 1000 cells/5 μl
cell and 100 cells/5 μl cell concentration variation (all 170
elements classified by device type and sample type), collected
during spiked blood experiments and classified according to
the proposed scheme presented in figure 4(c). The entire data
with all 170 data sets, 17 combinations, 4 positive controls
and 13 negative controls, were defined in these experiments
Figure 3. Schematic of the device functionalization using PASE; (b) sample types consisting of plain blood, SKBR3 spiked blood, MCF7
spiked blood and MCF10A spiked blood.

 as they are presented in figure 5 and can be represented in one
map that can enable fast analysis by a technician. For
example, the signal rise is indicated by blocks that are in the
increasing direction. For no change the blocks are at the
x-axis level and for decrease, the blocks go in the negative
direction. The data visualized in this manner presents an easy
way to analyze the sample condition and is suitable for the
clinic. The actual data is presented in figures S4 and S5
(online supplementary information) for the 170 datasets.
Again, three types of signals were observed with respect to
the buffer control: signal that increased, decreased, or did not
significantly change with respect to the buffer control. It was
observed that the majority of signals in all four positive
controls were located in ‘Zone1’ showing an increase in
device conductance, with respect to the buffer control. On the
other hand the majority of the signals, 11 out of the 13, in
negative controls landed in ‘Zone 3’, showing a decrease in
their signal, device conductance, after addition of the sample
droplet with respect to the buffer control. Online supple-
mentary table S1 summarizes the zone classification results
for all the data presented here. Overall, we observed that
specific interaction indicated an increase in the device con-
ductance whereas non-specific interaction resulted in a
decrease or no change in device conductance. These results
show great promise to discriminate spiked cancer cells in
blood based on their effect on CNT electrical properties. All
these results are also in line with our electrical signatures and
classification of spiked cancer cells in buffy coats [23]. In all
our experiments we noted that the detection specificity for
anti-Her2 devices were better than anti-EpCAM devices in
these blood experiments.
We also conducted protein experiments to ascertain our
hypothesis using a streptavidin-biotin model system for signal
rise. Figure S6 (online supplementary information) presents
the normalized live response of six CNT devices, three
functionalized with streptavidin (positive control in green)
Figure 4. (a) Specific interaction: anti-Her2 functionalized device with 1000 SKBR3 cells spiked in blood; (b) non-specific snteraction: anti-
Her2 functionalized device with 1000 MCF10A cells spiked in blood; (c) non-specific snteraction: anti-Her2 functionalized device with plain
blood adsorption; (d) zone classification scheme of the electrical signals.

 and three non-functionalized bare CNT devices (negative
control in red). 5 μl of biotin solution, 1 ng ml−1 in 1×PBS,
was added to each device at 60 s and the electrical current of
the device was recorded for the remaining 240 s. The func-
tionalized devices current increased after biotin introduction
suggesting negatively charged biotin molecules interacting
with streptavidin is equivalent to applying a negative gate
voltage, thus increasing the nanotube-complex device con-
ductance [35, 36] while, the bare devices show no significant
change. This indicates that the primary effect of the nanotube-
streptavidin-biotin binding is a charge-transfer reaction [37].
In general, membrane potential of cancer cells are dif-
ferent from normal cells and recently they have been sug-
gested
as
a
valuable
clinical
biomarker
for
tumor
detection [38].
Electrophysiological analyses in many cancer cell types
have revealed a depolarized Vm that favors cell proliferation
and new data suggest level of Vm has functional roles in
Figure 5. Merger of device array data for 1000 cells/5 μl and 100 cells/5 μl variation using the zone classification scheme. The entire data
can be divided into different experiments with both specific and non-specific interactions. (a) Data series based on 1000 cells spiked in blood;
(b) data series based on 100 cells spiked in blood. Each panel correlates with one combination of sample type and device type with respect to
design of experiment, 10 replicates each. Each row correlates to one type of device functionalization such as anti-HER-2, anti-EpCAM, and
IgG. The top row represents the type of cells spiked namely SkBr3, MCF7, MCF10A. Plain blood samples are shown in red, MCF-10A in
green, MCF-7 in orange and yellow, and SKBR-3 in blue. The control buffer signal is shown as the x-axis. The symbol (+) represents signal
increase, (0) represents no change and (−) represents signal decrease.

 cancer cell migration [38]. Vm changes because of alterations
in the conductance of one or more types of ions. The Gold-
man–Hodgkin–Katz equation shows the Vm dependency on
both the intracellular and extracellular concentrations of
major ions (Na+/K+) [39, 40]. Thus interaction of specific
antibodies to the extracellular receptors is bound to affect Vm.
MCF7, MCF10A and SKBR3 cells have all negative resting
potential. For example, the MCF7 potential was reported to
vary from −58.6 to −2.7 mV with the cell cycle [41].
Extracellular EpCAM receptors on MCF7 cells interacting
with anti-EpCAM antibodies on nanotube surface should thus
lead to an increase in conductance of the nanotube-complex
similar to negatively charged proteins [35, 36]. These sug-
gests specific interactions are characteristically different
compared to non-specific interactions and confirm our
hypothesis [23, 25, 35, 36]. These studies are also in line with
our previous studies on ƒ-EpCAM protein detection based on
nanotube transistor devices [42], as well as cellular studies in
PBS and buffy coats [23, 25].
Online supplementary table S1 summarizes the zone
classification quantitatively. It is seen that all the specific
interactions had maximum of 6/10 signals in ‘Zone 1’,
whereas non-specific interactions had 9/10 signals in com-
bination of ‘Zone 2’ and ‘zone 3’. This suggest that this
classification scheme may be highly useful in clinic, where
one can define a threshold of at least 5/10 devices in ‘Zone 1’
as a ‘diagnostic gray zone’ which may indicate the presence
of cancer cells in blood on the device. While online supple-
mentary table S1 presents the quantifiable data, the blocks can
also be added in each zone in figure 5 to come to the same
conclusion. One can then further analyze the devices for cell
capture using optical and confocal microscopy if the threshold
exceeds 5/10 devices. It should be noted that some devices
for specific interactions do not increase in signal. There could
be several reasons such as nanotube network arrangement,
poor PASE/antibody functionalization in some devices,
devices irreversibly altering their electrical properties during
the experiments in PBS and blood, all of which needs to be
probed further in the future for better accuracy. We have not
taken any of these into account and the results presented are
directly from the testing without further modification.
3.5. DTW classification
In the past, we have developed a new philosophy of enabling
DTW to classify electrical signatures in cells spiked in buffy
coats in a blinded test with 91% sensitivity and 82% speci-
ficity [23, 42]. DTW is a dynamic programming algorithm
that seeks to find an optimal global or local alignment of two
series in the time domain to minimize the total distance
between the series with respect to a traditional distance metric
such as Euclidean distance metric. The DTW-distance can
then be used as dissimilarity metric for developing kernel-
based classifiers. A k-nearest neighbors kernel-based statis-
tical classifier was developed using pairwise DTW-distances
between samples. We chose to employ a kernel-based learn-
ing method as a parametric model for CTC evaluation has not
yet been developed. In order to test whether the HER2
functionalized devices could discriminate between SKBR3
spiked blood samples and controls (plain blood and MCF10A
spiked blood), a classifier was constructed and the area under
the receiver operator curve (AUC) was estimated by 10-fold
cross-validation (CV) [43]. Algorithm parameters and series
normalization method were also determined by CV. The
series normalization methods evaluated were: mean-variance
normalization of the entire series, slope correction followed
by normalization, and slope correction followed by scaling by
the value at a fixed time-point. Mean-variance normalization
was defined as
=
-
yi
s
y
y
i
i
i
y
¯ where y
i
¯ represents the mean of the
ith replicate series and syi represents the standard deviation.
Slope correction was conducted by fitting a linear model to
the first 75 series sampling points to estimate the machine
drift of the devices. In addition to evaluating slope correction
followed by mean-variance normalization, slope correction
followed by scaling the series by dividing by series value at a
standardized time-point (50) was evaluated. Prior to normal-
ization or scaling, the series were truncated to have length
150, with the length symmetric about the time-point of dro-
plet deposition. Both high (1000/5 μl) and low (100/5 μl)
concentrations of spiked cells were evaluated, separately. A
total of 30 replicates (10 replicates with 1000 SKBR3 cells/
5 μl spiked, 10 replicates with no cells added, and 10 repli-
cates with 1000 MCF10A cells/5 μl spiked) were used in the
construction of the classifier. To ensure balance between the
SKBR3 positive condition and negative condition, a random
sample of five replicates with no spiked cells and five repli-
cates with 1000 MCF-10A cells/5 μl spiked was combined as
SKBR3 negative. Whether the series observed with anti-
HER2 antibody functionalized devices and SKBR3 spiked
blood could be discriminated from IgG functionalized devices
was then evaluated to determine if the anti-HER2 antibody
and SKBR3 spiked blood resulted in a specific as opposed to
non-specific antibody–antigen interaction.

classifiers for the high concentration of SKBR3 cells with
anti-HER2 functionalized devices are shown in figure S7(a)

the 1-nearest neighbor classifier with slope corrected nor-

sion matrix for high concentration SKBR3 cells is presented
in table 2. AUC for discriminating a low concentration con-
dition is shown in figure S7(b) (online supplementary). AUC

 versus IgG) with SKBR3 cells spiked in blood is shown in
figure S7(c) (online supplementary).
Devices functionalized with anti-HER2 antibody were
able to discriminate between blood spiked with a high con-
centration of SKBR3 cells (1000/5 μl) and control blood
(spiked with MCF10A cells, or not spiked, plain blood). 10-
fold CV estimated AUC for the 1-nearest neighbor DTW-
distance based classifier was 0.90 after slope correction and
normalization. Table 2 presents the confusion matrix. One
false negative and one false positive out of 10 positives and
10 negatives were observed in the CV procedure, showing a
CV estimated sensitivity of ∼90% and specificity of ∼90%.
Of the replicates identified as true positives, 6/9 series fin-
ished higher, ‘Zone 1’, after the rebound that followed droplet
injection than the initial period, indicating a favorable ΔG; of
the replicates identified as true negatives, 7/9 series finished
lower, ‘Zone 3’ after the rebound that followed droplet
injection than the initial period. While employing a kernel-
based classification method was successful, developing
parametric models that incorporate the theoretical patterns
corresponding to expected Gibbs free energy change should
be further pursued in the future.
Devices functionalized with HER2 antibody were unable
to significantly discriminate (>50%) between blood spiked
with a low concentration of SKBR3 cells (100 cells/5 μl) and
control blood using a kernel-based classifier. However, we
could analytically differentiate the signals as presented in
table S1 (online supplementary information), suggesting this
algorithm may not work well as has been done in many cases
before for generating malignancy maps [44] based directly on
the sensor signal without the need for an advanced classifier at
low cell concentrations. We hypothesize that the deterioration
of performance in using kernels based on DTW-distance for
discriminating interactions is that at low cell concentrations
archetypical patterns do not dominate each kernel in-spite of
the existence of overall qualitative patterns. Consequently
further studies comparing kernel-based classifiers to para-
metric models based on expected free energy change.
In general, we achieved good discrimination based on
DTW from the cancer cell concentration of 1000/5 μl or
200 000 ml−1, which is at the high concentration end of the
real patient range of 50–300 000 ml−1 [14, 29, 30]. In order to
improve sensitivity towards more real world applications
several solutions are proposed: (1) the device we used here
were 3 mm×3 mm size per device. A much smaller device
could be expected to be more sensitive to few cells. Such a
device could indeed be part of the array; (2) a parametric
model based on change in free energy producing electrical
signals could be developed that could be more accurate than
DTW. Such a model can then be used in a training set clas-
sification and then be optimized for blinded study; (3) another
solution to improve the detection sensitivity for low con-
centration of cells is to integrate the nanotube devices with a
heater and investigate the protein denaturation and how they
affect electrical signals. Essentially, this would be a nanotube
differential scanning calorimeter with an electrical and
temperature signal. Differential scanning calorimetry in the
past has been applied to identify protein denaturation patterns,
or thermograms, in blood plasma samples of cervical cancer
versus controls. Plasma thermograms from patients suffering
from a variety of diseases appear different in amplitude and
denaturation temperature [45]. Cancer samples have been
identified from controls in plasma with ∼97% classification
accuracy based on Group classification methods compared to
standard I-RELIEF method which only gives ∼73% classifi-
cation accuracy [45]. We believe such a micro-array with
integrated heaters and group classification algorithms can
further differentiate and improve sensitivity of signal classi-
fication at very low cellular concentrations.
Fixing sample phenotype (blood spiked with 1000
SKBR3 cells) allowed for discrimination of antibody func-
tionalization, anti-HER2 versus IgG functionalized device.
Tenfold CV estimated AUC for the 1-nearest neighbor DTW-
distance based classifier was 0.70 after slope correction and
normalization (figure S7 (c) in online supplementary infor-
mation). Based on the results from fixing the sample pheno-
type and separately device phenotype, we can suggest that the
significant difference seen in electrical signal with our posi-
tive controls must be as a result of HER2 receptor, on the cell
membrane, interaction with the anti-HER2 antibody on the
surface of the nanotube device. These results are also in line
with our previous blinded test studies on buffy coats [23] and
gives us great confidence in the hypothesis that specific
interactions are characteristically different from non-specific
interactions and can be classified using nanotube-micro-
arrays.
Figure 6(a) presents the heatmap of the between signal
DTW distances for the signals used in the classifier employed
for discriminating the high concentration of SKBR3 cells. In
the margins of this figure a dendrogram of the complete-
linkage agglomerative hierarchical clustering of the same is
shown [40]. Within the clusters determined by the complete-
linkage agglomerative hierarchical clustering there is evi-
dence of sample type confusion however this confusion was
reduced when considering 1-nearest neighbor kernels for
classification. The kernel-based DTW classifier partitioned
the SKBR3 spiked blood and controls (MCF7 spiked blood
and non-spiked blood) suggesting specific interactions are
quite unique in their electrical signatures compared to non-
specific interactions and establishes a relationship between
electrical conductance data with biological and possibly
proteomic features (presence or absence of cancer cells in
blood versus presence or absence of Her2). Figure 6(b) pre-
sents the Her2 clustering data. The classifier is thus able to
naturally partition the SKBR3 cells in blood data over-
expressing Her2. This type of clustering would potentially be
useful for the clinic to stratify devices based on Her2/other
receptor data.
3.6. Optical microscopy and enumeration of CTCs
In a static blood sample/droplet the cells inside the blood start
to settle immediately due to the forces of gravity, resulting in
cells coming in contact and interacting with the base substrate
surface. One can tune the surface interactions for efficient
capture of CTCs. The initial observations on the optical
12
Nanotechnology 27 (2016) 44LT03
 microscope of cancer cell spiked blood sample droplets on top
of the devices showed that the spiked cancer cells as part of
their settling process get buried under RBCs and on top of the
CNT network established on silicon substrate, getting sand-
wiched in between. Three examples of spiked cancer cell
blood samples are presented in figure 7(a) at two different
magnifications. Spiked cancer cells are observed in the blood
and marked with an arrow, one can clearly observe the cancer
cells buried under the RBCs and on top of the substrate. Cells
that were imaged in ‘Zone 2’ in the spiked blood samples are
also shown. The size, shape and the number of cells seen in
‘Zone 2’is consistent with white blood cells (WBCs). A high
concentration of RBCs is apparent on top of the marked
cancer cells in ‘Zone 1’. In figure 7(b), optical microscopy of
plain blood sample is presented at the same two magnifica-
tions. There are no spiked cancer cells seen as the microscope
is focused in ‘Zone 1’ plane. On the other hand, when the
objective is focused on the ‘Zone 2’ plane, WBCs are
apparent and come into focus in the image (right panel),
floating above the RBCs. We have presented a model of
differential settling in figure 7(c) in direct identification of
spiked cancer cells and distinguishing from leukocytes using
nanotube devices in an optical microscopy setting. Our results
of the settling of cancer cells to the bottom is also consistent
with the rise in electrical signal which could come from the
interaction of the cell surface receptors with the antibodies on
the nanotube surface. This self-enrichment process needs to
be further studied by tuning nanotube network density,
hydrophobicity,
and
functionalization
process.
Further,
enhancement of enrichment can also be enabled through the
presence of an electric field to separate the larger cancer cells
displacing a volume in blood thereby changing the electric
field. While these studies are beyond the scope of the current
study, nevertheless these intriguing observations opens up
new ideas and areas of study in optical microscopy of cells by
tuning the surface interactions for CTC capture.
As a result of our observations with regards to blood cell
settling as illustrated in figure 7(c), we were able to image
‘Zone1’ and further analyze the captured spiked cancer cells
using optical microscopy. A number of devices with 1000
spiked cells and 100 spiked cell samples were selected and
their respective optical microscope images were taken. 20
devices imaged at 20× magnification, and 15 devices, imaged
at 5× magnification, were selected for further processing and
analysis.
3.7. Spiked breast cancer cell enumeration in blood
Figures S6(a) and (d) (online supplementary information)
present an example set of 20× and 5× optical images taken
for image analysis. ImageJ software was used to process each
image. The histograms in each image presents the number of
cells counted in each device. Original optical images were
converted to binary images and processed using NIH ImageJ
software to distinguish spiked cells, shown in black circles,
from the RBCs in the background by using the color
threshold function as presented in online supplementary
figures S6(b) and (e). Next, ImageJ software’s particle ana-
lysis function was used to count the number of cells and cell
diameter for each set of images knowing the scale bar for each
image (online supplementary figures S6(c) and (f). All the
data from these analyses, including number of cells per

interactions are quite unique in their electrical signatures compared to non-specific interactions and establishes a relationship between
electrical conductance data with proteomic features; (b) the Her2 clustering data suggest all SKBR3 cells in blood overexpressing Her2

 image, cells per unit of area (mm2), diameter of cells, and
number of cells per device calculated based on cell counts and
total device area, 9 mm2, are presented in the histograms in
online supplementary figure S8 and table S2. It should be
noted that the imaging was done on only ∼62% active area of
the device or the nanotube surface. In these experiments,
blood did spread outside the active area of the device in some
of the samples and CTCs in those areas were not counted, nor
did they contribute to the electrical signal. These devices were
initially designed for sensing experiments. An SU8 layer was
used to isolate all the electrical layers except the active
nanotube layer using an extra photo-lithography step. Even
with only ∼62% active area of device imaged and counted,
this resulted in anywhere between 342 and 1049 cells cap-
tured, using optical microscopy on the active area of the
nanotube device, resulting in a capture yield (normalized to
62%) of 55%–100%. Even without normalization, the capture
yield still represents 34.2%–100%. The slightly greater than
1000 cells counted is a result of small variations in cells
counted in spiking experiments using a hemocytometer. This
error is common and has been reported in other CTC reports
[13]. The two different magnifications also give the same
average number of cells counted per device, suggesting these
are indeed spiked cancer cells.
Online supplementary figure S9 shows the reproduci-
bility of our technique from device to device. 15 such devices
are presented that were adsorbed with 1000 SKBR3 cells
spiked in blood. We can clearly distinguish between ‘Zone 1’
and ‘Zone 2’ images. Zone 1 shows the presence of spiked
cancer cells in all the devices. Similarly Zone 1 imaging of
plain blood, no spiked cells are seen. The WBCs are also seen
in the plain blood in ‘Zone 2’. The images illustrate that blood

cell blood samples are shown. Spiked cancer cells are observed in the blood and marked with an arrow, one can clearly observe the cancer
cells buried under the RBCs and on top of the CNT film. High concentration of RBCs is apparent on top of the marked cancer cells in ‘Zone

WBCs observed in plain blood samples when the microscope is focused in ‘Zone 1’ plane. On the other hand when image is focused in the

differential settling of blood sample on device observations under the microscope, showing the approximate arrangement of RBCs, WBCs,
and spiked cancer cells and the classification of ‘Zone 1’ and ‘Zone 2’ accordingly.

 does settle in all the devices in the same way and that this
effect is reproducible. Online supplementary table S2 presents
the quantitative data from these processed images at 20× and
5× magnification respectively. The tables suggest hundreds
of cells are captured in each of the devices. In table S2, at
20× magnification anywhere from 342 to 1049 cells were
captured in the active area suggesting a normalized capture
yield of 55%–100% as mentioned before. The cell count data
in table S2 indicate higher resolution and more accurate
counts is possible in a small window area at the 20× mag-
nification. The cellular diameters are also more representative.
Online supplementary table S3 presents the 5× magnified cell
count data. The cell count data in this table indicate one can
get a more uniform distribution of the cell counts at the
smaller magnification. Here, anywhere from 489 to 808 cells
were captured, for a capture yield of 48.9%–80.8%. Since the
active area of 62% was only imaged, this would represent a
normalized yield of 78.8%–100%. The counts from both
magnifications confirm the imaged cells are spiked breast
cancer cells. Exceeding 100% is as a result of variation in
spiking done manually using a hemocytometer as mentioned
before [13]. Similarly, online supplementary figure S10 pre-
sents representative images of the cell capture data for 100
SKBR3 spiked cancer cells in blood. All the regions are seen,
namely CTC in ‘Zone 1’ and WBC in ‘Zone 2’. The spiked
cancer cells were also 10 times sparser than the 1000 SKBR3
spiked blood images. These gives us confidence in the capture
yield per device. Online supplementary table S4 presents the
cell count data and the diameters of the captured cells.
Anywhere between 43 to 107 cells were imaged and counted
on the active area of the device, suggesting a normalized
capture yield of 69%–100%. It should be noted that while the
capture yield of 100% is seen, these are on an individual
device level. Summing all the cell counts for the 20 devices
presented in online supplementary table S2 suggest capture of
12 478 cells out of 20 000 cells spiked in 0.1 ml of blood or
62.39% capture yield, similar to the first CTC chip [12]. This
yield can be further improved over 1 ml of blood quite easily
in the future in the next generation device. While we only
imaged 20 devices as a demonstration of the potential of this
chip, in patient samples, one can image all the devices in 1 ml
that can improve efficiency of cell enumeration. One can also
improve capture efficiency per device by making the device
area pad slightly larger to accommodate the entire 5–20 μl
drop. Thus this novel idea presents a new design where
capture yield can be controlled by changing the area of the
pad to the area of the droplet, similar to controlling the flow
rate in microfluidic devices. Finally, it should be mentioned
the results in online supplementary tables S2, S3 and S4
suggest that we have achieved 100% yield in both 1000 and
100 cell spiked blood at different magnifications, suggesting
that the imaged cells are indeed spiked cells. While we tested
only SKBR3 cells spiked in blood for this study, the capture
yield may also depend on the type and concentration of cell
spiked and the free energy of interaction between antibody
and the receptor on cell surface. These need to be investigated
in the future.
3.8. Confocal microscopy
To confirm, the captured cells were indeed spiked breast
cancer cells, four anti-HER2 functionalized devices with
adsorbed SKBR3 spiked blood that gave positive electrical
signatures were further analyzed using confocal microscopy.
The samples were washed three times to assess binding of
cells and stained for cytokeratin, CD45 and DAPI. Figure 8
demonstrates captured SKBR3 cells on the device stained for
cytokeratin (CK-19 positive for epithelial cells and negative
for hematological cells) and CD45 (negative for epithelial
cells and positive for hematological cells). CTCs captured on
the device were identified by staining with 4,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole (DAPI) for DNA content, and using rhodamine-
conjugated anti-cytokeratin antibodies for epithelial cells, and
fluorescein-conjugated anti-CD45 antibodies for hematologic
cells. Cells captured by an anti-Her2 functionalized device
that showed positive staining for CK-19 were identified as
cancer cells, whereas CD45-positive cells were identified as
leukocytes, as presented in figure 8. The morphologic char-
acteristics exhibited by the captured cells were consistent with
malignant cells, including large cellular size in the merged
image. Single cells could be identified in the merged image,
suggesting that the nanotube–CTC chip is a viable technique
for identification of CTCs from leukocytes using cytokeratin
and CD45 antibodies. In the future, an automated system
could snap images of the chip at different places that were
stained. Cells can also be removed from the active area of the
device that gave positive electrical signatures for confocal
microscopy and qPCR. Another way is to stratify all the
devices that gave positive electrical signatures and remove all
the cells from those devices and do confocal analysis in one
step for enumeration. The ability to do staining and identify
cancer cells from leukocytes shows the viability of this
technology for CTC capture. We also noticed that most of the
leukocytes were washed away, with only one or two
remaining to be imaged. These results also suggest that the
leukocytes were not bound to the nanotube substrate, in line
with the model proposed on differential settling of blood.
4. Discussion and outlook
It is well known that tumor cells circulate in the peripheral
blood of all major carcinomas but not in healthy subjects or
patients with non-malignant disease. Several approaches
based on microfluidics and other methods as mentioned
before have been reported for CTC capture and analysis. So
far passive cell sorting in small droplets of blood in a micro-
array format with integrated advanced classifiers has not been
attempted to sort and enumerate CTCs in the manner we have
proposed. There are several advantages to this type of
approach including: (1) micro-array format, (2) on-chip
microscopy, (3) analytical and DTW based statistical classi-
fication, (4) optical microscopy based enumeration, and (5)
live viable cells that can be processed further for downstream
analysis such as qPCR. The immuno-magnetic technology
was the first to arrive in the market [9–11]. While impressive,
15

 the technology suffers from small numbers of CTCs isolated
and low yield (∼20%–60% of patients) [9–11]. Compared to
immunomagnetic technology, the CTC chip technology
asserts ∼65%–80% yield using microfluidic technology based
on the flow rate [12, 13]. Our work is new and unique in the
introduction of static-micro-array isolation of spiked cancer
cells in blood. The CNT is used to achieve electrical sensing
as well as hydrophobic surface interactions for droplet loca-
lization where blood settles into different layers that can be
analyzed using optical microscopy. PASE functionalization is
unique to nanotubes and graphene and enables a non-covalent
and stable functionalization methodology. Finally, DTW-
distance kernel based classification is an advanced technique
that shows viability of instant classification of the electrical

 signals that has not been employed in this area. Therefore this
platform is quite unique and has potential for clinical
translation.
One advantage is that our work shows the feasibility of
classifying samples based on the device electrical signatures
in short time frames (within few minutes), an important
advantage in the clinic, considering that cells removed from
their native microenvironment rapidly change their pheno-
type. Once classified, devices that gave positive electrical
signals can then be sent to a laboratory for further validation
such as qPCR. Even our analytical classification technique is
quite useful and friendly for the clinic to be able to read the
number of positives and negatives directly. With its capability
for fast and sensitive cell capture, the nanotube micro-arrays
has the potential to become a useful tool for CTC capture and
enumeration and also studies related to drug screening and
intracellular signaling [23].
Finally the presented nanotube–CTC chip is gentle in
nature and allows for isolation of viable cells, whereas
magnetic-bead-based approaches can only isolate fixed, non-
viable cells [11]. Since this is a static isolation device, no
shear forces are applied to the cells, unlike microfluidic
devices that can encounter high shear forces at high flow
rates. The leukocytes are also washed out quite easily com-
pared to cancer cells on the nanotube–CTC chip, as the cancer
cells are bound to the device on the bottom, compared to the
leukocytes that settle on the top and therefore not bound to the
device. Thus, there is no need to enrich the samples as this is a
self-enrichment process. An important aspect of our tech-
nology that we have demonstrated is that blood fractionated
into smaller volumes in a micro-array format can also give
rise to more predictable and accurate results, similar to
microfluidic technologies. One can enable a wide variety of
experimentation within an array with different types of anti-
bodies, thus potentially paving the way for an advanced
device where CTCs expressing different receptors can be
fished out in a single array, which cannot be done currently by
a single microfluidic device. For example, it has been reported
EpCAM expression is approximately 10-fold lower on CTC
as compared to primary and metastatic tissues, suggesting that
EpCAM expression is transient and dependent upon the local
micro-environment [19]. Therefore it becomes important to
look for more than one marker apart from EpCAM. The
nanotube–CTC chip thus is advantageous in this sense due to
the array approach to capture CTCs with different antibodies
compared to single microfluidic device. One can also scale
this technology even further for higher volumes (7.5–30 ml)
by adding more elements to the array/changing device size
and automation. The benefit of batch manufacturing is that
these devices can be fabricated at low cost. One can also
assemble an automated laboratory based system similar to the
Veridex CellSearch system where a robotic arm can drop the
blood samples simultaneously on number of devices, while
measuring the electrical conductivity, instant classification
using DTW-distance based/zone classifier, and conducting
automated optical/confocal microscopy on chip at different
depth of focus. The nanotube–CTC chip thus is capable of
enabling higher information content both in detection and
capture about the disease status has the potential for clinical
translation with further testing in a clinical setting.
In summary, the nanotube–CTC chip is a detection and
capture technology that captures large numbers of viable
spiked breast cancer cells in whole blood without pre-label-
ing, pre-fixation, or any other processing steps. Blood can
simply be adsorbed and electrical sensing and DTW classi-
fication can enable detection and stratification. Classified
devices can then be analyzed using optical/confocal micro-
scopy on chip. The techniques described here, namely static
isolation in a micro-array format adds to the new philosophy
of rare cell capture, which has not been investigated and
shows promise for capture and study of CTCs.
