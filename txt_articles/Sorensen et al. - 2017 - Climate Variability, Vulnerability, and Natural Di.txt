Abstract Climate change presents complex and wide-reaching threats to human health. A variable and
changing climate can amplify and unmask ecological and socio-political weaknesses and increase the risk
of adverse health outcomes in socially vulnerable regions. When natural disasters occur in such areas,
underlying climatic conditions may amplify the public health crisis. We describe an emerging epidemic of
Zika virus (ZIKV) in Ecuador following the 2016 earthquake, which coincided with an exceptionally strong El
Niño event. We hypothesize that the trigger of a natural disaster during anomalous climate conditions and
underlying social vulnerabilities were force multipliers contributing to a dramatic increase in ZIKV
cases postearthquake.
1. Introduction
Climate change is emerging as one of the greatest modern threats to human health (Wang & Horton, 2015;
Watts et al., 2017). Over the past decade, increasingly unambiguous science has linked anthropogenic emis-
sions with unprecedented worldwide changes in the stability of our climate and environment (Pachauri et al.,
2014). It is anticipated that as the planet continues to warm we will see novel, complex, and wide-reaching
impacts on human health (Kim, 2016). A variable and changing climate can amplify and unmask underlying
ecological and socio-political weaknesses (Luber & Lemery, 2015) and increase the risk of adverse health out-
comes in vulnerable (i.e., low income) as well as socioeconomically stable regions. When natural disasters
occur, climate change may amplify the public health crisis. Here we describe an emerging epidemic of
Zika virus (ZIKV) in the coastal province of Manabi, Ecuador, following the 2016 earthquake which coincided
with an exceptionally strong El Niño event. In coastal Ecuador, El Niño events are associated with heavy rain-
fall and warmer air temperatures and have been shown to be associated with outbreaks of dengue fever
(Stewart-Ibarra & Lowe, 2013). We hypothesize that the trigger of the earthquake during anomalous climate
conditions coupled with underlying social vulnerabilities was the principal force multipliers of this outbreak.
Extreme climate events associated with climate change will likely play a larger role in human health out-
comes during natural disasters in the future.
2. The Earthquake
On 16 April 2016, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake occurred off the coast of Ecuador, impacting approximately
720,000 people and placing the country’s health system on maximum alert. According to the Pan
American Health Organization (World Health Organization, 2016a), essential infrastructure, including hospi-
tals and health-care facilities, were rendered inoperative – both due to unstable structural damage as well
as loss of electricity, rupture of water and gas pipes, and other damages. Reports by the United States
Agency for International Development (USAID) estimated 660 fatalities, 40 missing persons, 4,605 injuries,
9,750 damaged buildings, over 30,000 people displaced, and 720,000 people requiring humanitarian assis-
tance (United States Agency for International Development, 2016). Many rural communities were isolated,
while cities became chaotic with influxes of displaced populations. The national Secretary for Risk

 Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), Red Cross, Pan American Health Organization/World Health
Organization (PAHO/WHO), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Médecins Sans
Frontières, among others) reacted after the event, providing emergency medical teams, mobile water
treatment units, and temporary shelter for residents (World Health Organization, 2016a). The earthquake
caused tremendous social and environmental disturbance, resulting in population displacement, a
breakdown in piped water and sanitation infrastructure, a disruption in health-care services, and increases
in psychological distress. This resulted in a surge in morbidity and mortality from both communicable and
noncommunicable diseases, including diseases transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito.
3. The Virus
The first reported cases of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in Ecuador were documented on 15 January 2016
(World Health Organization, 2016b), just months before the earthquake. ZIKV is an arbovirus transmitted to
people by the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, and also by other transmission routes, includ-
ing sexual transmission (Petersen et al., 2016). As of August 2017, 6,811 suspected and confirmed cases of
ZIKV have been reported from Ecuador, including seven cases of congenital ZIKV syndrome and 660 con-
firmed cases in pregnant women (Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization, 2017a,
2017b). In the majority of symptomatic patients, ZIKV infections result in a mild acute febrile illness associated
with rash, conjunctivitis, arthralgia, and headache, with the potential for late neurologic complications such
Guillain-Barre Syndrome (Petersen et al., 2016). Despite a relatively mild clinical course in symptomatic
healthy adults, the effect on fetal development can be devastating. Fetal death, fetal growth restriction,
and a spectrum of central nervous system abnormalities have been documented in more than 40% of cases
of maternal infection (Brasil et al., 2016). In a recent study of U.S. women with evidence of ZIKV infection dur-
ing the first trimester of pregnancy, 11% had an infant with a birth defect (Honein et al., 2017). The same
vectors that carry ZIKV also transmits dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), which cocirculate
in the same populations and cause significant morbidity in coastal Ecuador. In 2016, there were 14,150
reported DENV cases and 1,860 cases of CHIKV in the country (Pan American Health Organization, 2017).
Leading up to 16 April 2016, 92 total cases of ZIKV had been documented countywide. In the wake of the
earthquake, this number rapidly escalated from 92 to 1,106 total cases in just 3 months (United Nations
International Children’s Emergency Fund, 2016) (Figure 1). Eighty-percent of these cases were reported in
the province of Manabi, the region most impacted by the earthquake (United Nations International
Children’s Emergency Fund, 2016; Pan American Health Organization, 2017) (Figure 2). A vector control inter-
vention was instituted by the Ministry of Health (MoH) after the earthquake, which included larvicide (teme-
fos/abate) application, intrahouse fumigation, thermal nebulizers, and bed nets targeted at displaced people
and women of fertile age. This emergency intervention lasted until June 2016.

 4. Social Vulnerability
“Social vulnerability” is an indicator of the sensitivity of a community to disturbances from environmental
hazards and natural disasters and a metric of its capacity to respond, adapt, and recover (Cutter et al.,
2003). Similarly, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Pachauri et al., 2014) views social vulner-
ability as a function of the degree to which a population will respond to a given change in climate, and its
adaptive capacity or the “degree to which adjustments in practices, processes, or structures can moderate
or offset the potential for damage.” The ability of a community to demonstrate adaptive capacity or resilience
in the face of natural disasters and climate change is dependent upon its technical, institutional, economic,
and cultural ability, as well as existing health-care infrastructure (Beccari, 2016). Many indices attempt to
objectively capture “vulnerability” and “resilience,” although diverse demographics and the uniqueness of
each natural disaster make these indices incredibly spatiotemporally dependent.
As a developing middle-income country, many geographic regions and social sectors of Ecuador are under-
resourced. Our prior studies from coastal Ecuador found that social vulnerabilities (e.g., lack of social cohe-
sion, poor housing conditions, and inadequate access to piped water in the home) interact with local
climate conditions to increase the risk of Ae. aegypti transmitted diseases in urban areas (Stewart Ibarra
et al., 2013; Stewart-Ibarra et al., 2014). According to the United Nations Development Programme
(Bermudez, 2017), following the earthquake, the “country’s emergency response capabilities were over-
whelmed, unleashing decades of pent up vulnerability.” Significant efforts are still underway to rebuild essen-
tial infrastructure. According to the World Bank, since 2016, urban unemployment rose from 4.5% to 6.5%
and urban underemployment increased from 11.7% to 18.8%, an effect that was linked to the earthquake
(World Bank, 2017). These indicators suggest that the country was indeed socially vulnerable when the earth-
quake struck and serves as an exemplar of population vulnerability in the face of climate change.
5. The Climate
The distribution and prevalence of vector-borne diseases is influenced by fluctuations in temperature and
precipitation (Gage et al., 2008), and large-scale climate phenomena such as the El Niño–Southern
Oscillation (Bi et al., 2005; Fisman et al., 2016; Githeko et al., 2000). The conditions that allowed for such a

 rapid spread of ZIKV in Manabi are likely multifactorial and include the following: historically high densities of
Aedes aegypti during the rainy season (February to May), the occurrence of an exceptionally strong El Niño
event (increasing the odds of arbovirus outbreaks) (Muñoz et al., 2017), a historically high burden of dengue
fever, and underlying social vulnerability associated with poverty. The earthquake compounded and intensi-
fied these vulnerabilities in the following ways: displaced populations sleeping outdoors who were at risk for
increased exposure to mosquito bites, water accumulation in containers near human settlements due to lack
of piped water, movement of people from most affected areas into other areas allowing for spread of ZIKV,
lack of access to basic health care, lack of health care for pregnant women potentially affected by ZIKV, low
use of contraceptives, and a breakdown in local governance. Although this earthquake occurred in a socio-
economically depressed community, the impacts mentioned above could likewise occur in wealthier com-
munities following a disaster, increasing their vulnerability to similar negative repercussions.
Climate variability affects the spread of vector-borne diseases both directly, through ecologic changes that
alter the abundance of insect and zoonotic vectors, and indirectly through changes in human behavior in
response to the climate and environment. Prior studies in southern coastal Ecuador have shown that local
weather conditions (rainfall and minimum temperature) are drivers of dengue transmission and Aedes aegypti
proliferation (Stewart Ibarra et al., 2013; Stewart-Ibarra et al., 2014). In terms of direct effects, air temperatures
influence vector development rates, reproductive behavior and mortality and warmer temperatures increase
rates of viral replication in the mosquito vector up to a certain optimal temperature (Morin et al., 2013). A
recent paper by Mordecai et al. (2017) showed the effects of temperature on DEN, ZIKV, and CHIKV transmis-
sion risk across Latin American and the Caribbean and found the maximum risk of transmission occurred
from 26 to 29°C. Precipitation also influences habitat suitability for mosquito larvae and pupae; however,
the effects depend on local social conditions. Increases in rainfall can increase the availability of larval habitat
(e.g., rain filled containers located outdoors); decreases in rainfall and water scarcity, as seen during seasonal
El Niño climate variations (Gagnon et al., 2001; Poveda et al., 2000) and postearthquake scenarios, can also
increase the availability of larval habitat due to impacts on water storage patterns (e.g., tap-water filled con-
tainers) (Ashby et al., 2017; Moreno-Madriñán & Turell, 2017; Stanforth et al., 2016). Over longer time scales,
rainfall, temperature, and humidity influence land cover and land use, which can alter development of vector
populations (Fuller et al., 2009).
One of the most important drivers of interannual variability in the climate in coastal Ecuador is the El Niño–
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (Santoso et al., 2013). Prior studies have demonstrated the impact of ENSO on
local climate anomalies and, as a result, on dengue outbreaks in coastal Ecuador (Borbor-Cordova, 2016;
Recalde-Coronel et al., 2014; Rossel & Cadier, 2009; Stewart Ibarra et al., 2013), and similar effects have been
documented elsewhere (Colon-Gonzalez et al., 2011; Hurtado-Diaz et al., 2007; Johansson et al., 2009). In
Ecuador, El Niño events are associated with warmer local air temperatures and increased rainfall, increasing
the likelihood of outbreaks of diseases transmitted by Ae. aegypti. Prior studies suggest that the climate vari-
ables that predict the intensity and timing of dengue outbreaks include minimum, maximum, and mean SST
temperature; minimum land surface temperature; local rainfall; and relative humidity and wind velocity
(Morin et al., 2013; Stewart Ibarra et al., 2013). As ZIKV is transmitted by the same mosquito vectors as
DENV, it is likely that these same climate variables are important drivers of ZIKV transmission.
As a result of global warming, sea surface temperatures since the beginning of the century have steadily
warmed (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2017), which directly impacts vector abundance
and the appearance of mosquito transmitted diseases. Some studies predict that the frequency of severe
El Niño events will increase with climate change (Cai et al., 2014; Timmermann et al., 1999). The relationship
between climate change and ENSO is complex yet inextricably linked (Santoso et al., 2013). Long-term cli-
mate trends are associated with anthropogenic climate change signals, while year-to year and decadal varia-
tions are driven by other global climate phenomena (Muñoz et al., 2016a, 2016b). When positive short-term
temperature anomalies are superimposed upon long-term warming, they combine to create anomalous eco-
logic conditions (Muñoz et al., 2016a, 2016b) conducive to the spread of arboviruses such as ZIKV, DENV, and
CHIKV. According to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the warming effects
of the 2015-2016 El Niño event contributed to making 2016 the third consecutive warmest year on record
(National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2016). At the time of the earthquake in Ecuador, a strong
El Niño event was smoldering in the Pacific Ocean (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2015),
and ZIKV had just emerged in Ecuador.

 The effect of climate variability on the spread of ZIKV in South America has been proposed (Muñoz et al.,
2016a, 2016b; Paz & Semenza, 2016) and, based on retrospective climate models, could have been predicted
(Muñoz et al., 2017). In Manabi, rising temperatures (Figure 3), increasing sea surface temperatures, an
ongoing El Niño event, and high abundance of mosquito vectors, followed by an earthquake in a socially vul-
nerable region, may have allowed an outbreak of a climate-sensitive emerging infectious disease.
6. Conclusions
The outbreak of ZIKV in Manabi, Ecuador, following the earthquake of 2016 demonstrates the negative
synergistic effects of natural disasters when superimposed upon anomalous climate conditions in socially
vulnerable regions. In this case example, an exceptionally strong El Niño event created environmental
conditions that favored mosquito vector replication just as ZIKV first appeared in Ecuador. Following the
earthquake, the incidence of ZIKV in Manabi surged as social conditions broke down in the aftermath of
the earthquake. We hypothesize that the trigger of a natural disaster during anomalous climate conditions
and underlying social vulnerabilities was force multipliers contributing to the spread of ZIKV in this region
of Ecuador.
As the planet continues to warm in this century, it is likely that we will see an increase in extreme climate
events that will compound the impact of acute and protracted humanitarian crisis. To mitigate the impact,
multisectoral coordination is needed in order to strengthen ties between the health sector, governmental
entities, and research and disaster management communities. Such intersectoral cooperation should aim
to (1) have the ability to quickly implement uniform health surveillance in the aftermath of major “natural”
disasters, (2) have integrated climate-health surveillance systems in place to support evaluations of the
extent to which disaster-related health impacts can be attributed to climate, and (3) create models that iden-
tify vulnerable communities and geographic regions and thus have longitudinal surveillance and early

city of high risk communities in order to reduce their vulnerability.
