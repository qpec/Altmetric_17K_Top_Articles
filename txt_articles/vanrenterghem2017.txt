Abstract There
have
been considerable
advances in
monitoring training load in running-based team sports in
recent years. Novel technologies nowadays offer ample
opportunities to continuously monitor the activities of a
player. These activities lead to internal biochemical stres-
ses on the various physiological subsystems; however, they
also cause internal mechanical stresses on the various
musculoskeletal tissues. Based on the amount and peri-
odization of these stresses, the subsystems and tissues
adapt. Therefore, by monitoring external loads, one hopes
to estimate internal loads to predict adaptation, through
understanding the load-adaptation pathways. We propose a
new theoretical framework in which physiological and
biomechanical load-adaptation pathways are considered
separately, shedding new light on some of the previously
published evidence. We hope that it can help the various
practitioners in this field (trainers, coaches, medical staff,
sport scientists) to align their thoughts when considering
the value of monitoring load, and that it can help
researchers design experiments that can better rationalize
training-load monitoring for improving performance while
preventing injury.
Key Points
Easy access to a huge diversity of training load data
in modern team sports has caused confusion about
the load-adaptation mechanisms to which different
data are expected to be associated.
We propose a new theoretical framework in which
physiological and biomechanical load-adaptation
pathways are considered separately, and for which
the distinction between internal and external load
measures is revisited.
Load-adaptation pathways have different response
rates, which has consequences for the planning of
training and/or rehabilitation sessions when
attempting to enhance performance and prevent (re-
)injury.
1 Introduction
Team sports are demanding activities and when players are
challenged to an appropriate level this can lead to physi-
ological adaptations of the aerobic, cardiovascular and
muscular systems. These adaptations benefit sporting per-
formance through increased endurance, speed, strength or
power. However, excessive amounts of training can lead to
overload of the system’s capacity and increased risk of
injury and illness. Otherwise, insufficient training may
annihilate the performance benefits. It is thus generally
accepted that players should be challenged adequately
through
appropriate
periodization
of
their
activities,
allowing optimal recovery between bouts of activity to

 achieve the desired physiological adaptations of the system
[1]. The activities performed by the athlete represent an
external
load,
yet
the
abovementioned
physiological
adaptations come about because of internal load, primarily
in the form of biochemical stresses.
Besides biochemical stresses, the activities performed
by the athlete also lead to mechanical stresses on the dif-
ferent tissues that comprise the musculoskeletal system, i.e.
on cartilage, bone, muscle and tendon tissue. Basic tissue
engineering science has demonstrated how mechanical
stresses are directly related to tissue damage and repair
(e.g. Wang et al. [2]), showing that homeostasis is triggered
directly through a narrow window of load intensities. This
means that as a consequence of the mechanical stresses,
structural and functional adaptations of the musculoskeletal
system take place. In the applied field of training-load
monitoring, this mechanical load-adaptation pathway has
been largely overlooked. We therefore propose a novel
framework in which the physiological and biomechanical
load-adaptation pathways are considered separately, as
schematically presented in Fig. 1. Albeit oversimplified,
for physiological load adaptations one could seek analogy
in the workings of a car engine, where the key focus is on
the consumption of fuel and oxygen. Sticking with this car
analogy, the biomechanical load adaptations could be
represented by the suspension system, where the key focus
is on keeping the mechanical properties intact. The aim of
this paper was to present how some scientific evidence on
measures of external and internal training load could be
interpreted according to these separate pathways, in the
hope that this may ultimately help resolve a current lack of
consensus in measures of training load [3].
2 Monitoring External Load
In the past few years, player monitoring systems based on
global positioning systems (GPS) have shown to be reliable
and valid for monitoring player activity levels in running-
based team sports [4–10]. In particular, kinematic variables
such as distance covered or some form of the average
running velocity are physiologically relevant as they can be
representative of energy consumption through the use of
so-called ‘metabolic power equations’. This works rea-
sonably well for constant speed sporting activities [11, 12],
however accelerating and decelerating the body involves
greater energetic cost than maintaining constant speed [13],
which has led to the integration of GPS-based accelerations
(second derivative of displacement) into adapted power
equations for team sports [14–16]. While this was shown to
improve estimates of energetic load [15], the fact that team
sports involve non-steady-state locomotion makes it very

 difficult to accurately estimate metabolic power, added to
the fact that reliability and validity of velocity-based
measures is lower for movements with higher accelerations
[10, 17], and the accuracy of GPS-based acceleration sig-
nals is known to be limited [18].
The biomechanical component of training load (Fig. 1,
right-hand side) depends largely on propulsive and break-
ing forces against the ground. It has been recognized that
players in team sports undertake some 500 rapid acceler-
ations and decelerations in a single match [19]. The
mechanical stresses on soft tissues (internal load) come
from these external kinetic demands of absorbing high
forces from the impact with the environment and generat-
ing high forces to push off against the ground (remember
the car suspension analogy). Directly measuring these
external forces is possible but difficult outside of a labo-
ratory. Instead, measuring the accelerations based on
Newton’s second law (with a certain mass, accelerations
are proportional to the external forces acting on the body)
is more feasible. The availability of low-cost inertial sen-
sors has led to the integration of accelerometers in com-
mercially available GPS units, and this in turn has led to an
expansion of the literature towards evaluating the relia-
bility of accelerometry-based variables [20–23] and their
utility to assess training load in various situations [24–27]
and sporting populations [23, 24, 28–30].
Accelerometers provide a continuous signal at a high
measuring frequency (currently 100 Hz in most commer-
cially available units) and, therefore, providing a summative
measure of this signal is needed to represent the extent to
which the body has been ‘shaken up’. A number of these
summative measures have been proposed, such as ‘Dynamic
Stress Load’ [31], ‘New Body Load’[32] or ‘Force Load’
[33], yet arguably the most commonly reported measure has
been Player LoadTM [20, 28]. The premise of these sum-
mative measures is that an estimate of the external biome-
chanical load can be provided through accumulating the rates
of acceleration. Recent studies have used PlayerLoadTM
values to monitor training load in season and between mat-
ches [34, 35], and some studies determined typical profiles in
various team sports [34, 36–39]. Scientists have attempted to
relate this to the physiological load (external or internal
measures), similar to what is commonly done in physical
activity monitoring (as reviewed by Chen and Bassett [40]
and Yang and Hsu [41]). For example, one study demon-
strated moderate to high relationships between Play-
erLoadTM and distance covered [29, 42], while other studies
demonstrated a moderate to high relationship between
PlayerLoadTM and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE)
[42–44] and a trivial to moderate relationship between
PlayerLoadTM and oxygen uptake ( _
VO2Þ or heart rate (HR)
data, respectively [20, 42, 45]. These relationships between
measures of physiological and biomechanical loads lack a
solid foundation, except for the fact that in running-based
team sports the variations in both types of loads are generally
experienced together. In fact, this was recognized in three
papers where, based on the poor relationship, it was sug-
gested that accumulated accelerometer-based outcomessuch
as PlayerLoadTM measure a different construct of the train-
ing process than internal physiological load measures such as
RPE or HR [35, 38, 42]. Rather, these measures are valuable
to estimate the extent to which the player, through their
activities, experiences accelerations and hence biomechan-
ical load of the body as a whole. Considering that the trunk is
the body segment with the highest mass, attaching an
accelerometer to the trunk provides the closest measure of
the accelerations of the whole body. The relationship
between trunk and whole-body accelerations is not perfect
but at least offers a starting point for measuring external load
from a biomechanical perspective [46].
3 Monitoring Internal Load
From a physiological perspective, if the external load is
increased by running further and faster, then that will lead
to increased metabolic energy cost [47, 48]. This metabolic
energy is needed to drive muscle contractions, which
mainly require the provision of carbohydrates, fats and
proteins, and the provision of oxygen in the case of aerobic
energy-burning processes. These are primarily challenges
to the cardiorespiratory system and therefore measures of
internal physiological load are most often related to oxygen
consumption and cardiac output. The various techniques
and measures of internal load have recently been reviewed
elsewhere [49, 50], and here we will focus on some of the
most commonly used ones. For example, cardiorespiratory
output is easily assessed in the field by recording HRs or
related outcome variables (e.g. training impulse [TRIMP],
as in Borresen and Lambert [51]), and has seen more
interest than oxygen consumption, which needs semi-in-
vasive laboratory-based techniques. Both cardiorespiratory
measures ignore the anaerobic contributions, for which
blood lactate values have been assessed [52, 53]. Blood
lactate values reflect an accumulation of previous efforts
rather than a measure of the last bout of anaerobic contri-
bution [23]. Second, a less direct measure of internal
physiological load is the subjective RPE. This is seen as an
index for training stress and has seen great popularity in the
field because of its ease of administration [51, 54, 55].
Despite the subjective nature of RPE, it has been shown to
correlate well with a number of HR-based internal load
indicators when multiplied by the duration of the session
[56], which could justify its use as an estimate of internal

 physiological load. Altogether, a number of techniques to
monitor internal physiological load, albeit indirectly, have
become established in running-based team sports, which is
not yet the case for monitoring internal biomechanical
load.
Monitoring mechanical stresses on the musculoskeletal
system requires measurement of variables such as joint
contact
forces
or
muscle–tendon
forces.
Advanced
biomechanical work is currently being undertaken to esti-
mate such forces in a laboratory environment through
musculoskeletal modelling approaches (e.g. Saxby et al.
[57]). At present this is impossible in a field context, and
the relationship between the aforementioned measures of
external load (e.g. from trunk accelerometry) and tissue-
specific mechanical stresses are insufficiently understood;
therefore, the question is whether indirect measures of
mechanical stresses to musculoskeletal tissue are available.
A first candidate is in fact RPE, which was earlier proposed
as a measure of internal physiological load. We would
argue that the biomechanical load can also lead to a per-
ception of how hard a session was, and that a generic RPE
probably reflects both types of internal load (biochemical
and mechanical stress). In one study, the session-based
RPE (RPE multiplied by the duration of the session) was
actually explained by acceleration-based measures, at least
to the same extent as by measures of energy expenditure,
which would suggest that it veers towards internal
biomechanical load [31]. By asking the player to be
specific in how much their ‘breathing’ was affected or how
much their ‘legs’ were affected, one may well be able to
separate their perceptions of physiological and biome-
chanical load. The idea of differential RPEs is not novel,
with ‘breathlessness’ and ‘leg exertion’ closely reflecting
the distinction between physiological and biomechanical
load, respectively [58]. Other measures of how mechani-
cally damaging training activities have been for the mus-
culoskeletal system is the rating of muscle soreness
[59, 60], the Profile of Moods (POMS) questionnaire, or
the Recovery-Stress Questionnaire (REST-Q) [61]. How-
ever, important disadvantages of these measures is that
these are best measured 1 or 2 days after the session took
place rather than immediately after the session, taking into
account the principle of delayed onset of muscle soreness
(DOMS), and that the repeated bout effect quickly leads to
less detectable or absence of muscle soreness [62].
Therefore, a more direct indicator of muscle damage is
desired and this is possible through measuring serum cre-
atine kinase (CK) levels [63]. In fact, increased CK levels
have been shown to moderately relate to acceleration-based
player load in rugby league [60] and Australian rules
football [64], evidencing the relationship between accu-
mulated tissue trauma (internal load) and external biome-
chanical loads. However, a limitation of CK levels as an
indicator for accumulated tissue damage is that its mea-
surement is difficult, that a single acute macro trauma
likely overrides the measure of accumulated micro trauma,
and that there is still a similar repeated bout effect as with
measures of muscle soreness. In summary, internal loads
can be difficult to measure directly, both from a physio-
logical and biomechanical perspective, but subjective
assessments through, for example, differential RPEs may
well be a suitable indirect alternative.
4 Adaptation
Principles of load and the assumed consequent adaptation
are generally accepted in a physiological context of train-
ing-load monitoring, both centrally (heart, lungs, nervous
system) or peripherally (capillarization, fibre subtypes,
molecular, oxidative, glycolytic). In the context of team
sports, these have been reviewed extensively elsewhere
(e.g. Wallace et al. [48], Howatson and Milak [63], and
Gamble [65]). However, to our knowledge, this principle
has not yet been formulated in an explicitly biomechanical
context. While a recent editorial [66] and review [54] have
already alluded to this, we believe that with more detailed
biomechanical understanding the distinct biomechanical
load-adaptation pathway in the proposed framework can be
further justified.
Biomechanical adaptations take place through mechan-
ical stresses to the various musculoskeletal tissues. Mus-
cular adaptations are perhaps best known and the most
responsive to mechanical stimuli, with considerable adap-
tations to mechanical properties such as fascicle length,
pennation angle, and muscle thickness (for an excellent
review on this matter, see Wisdom et al. [67]). Similar to
how muscle properties depend on mechanical stimuli, the
synthesis of other soft tissues and their molecular turnover
depends on the mechanical stresses to which they are
exposed. For example, articular cartilage that is regularly
exposed to high levels of stress has a higher cell volume
[68], a higher content of proteoglycans for better synthesis
[69, 70], and is stiffer [71]. Similarly, tendons undergo
structural adaptations that change their modulus [72], as
well as size adaptations based on habitual loading patterns
[73].
While
it
is
commonly
known
that
excessive
mechanical load accumulation can generate structural
failure in the form of chronic injuries (e.g. stress fractures,
tendinitis), the more subtle biomechanical adaptations are
often overlooked. This is probably because they are less
obvious to observe, and they tend to have a slower response
rate than physiological adaptations.
Differences in response rates can have important con-
sequences, as demonstrated in Fig. 2. In the top part of
Fig. 2, a sequence of physiological and biomechanical

123
 internal loading is delivered to the system in the form of
training sessions with a certain amount of load, for
example with 2-day intervals in between sessions. In the
bottom part of Fig. 2, the associated changes to the state of
physiological and biomechanical systems is shown through
the solid lines, which could be glycogen availability within
the muscle (physiological), and stiffness of a tendon
(biomechanical), to name two. When hypothetically taking
a biomechanical response rate that is twice as long as the
physiological response rate, the physiological adaptation
has reached supercompensation and the next training ses-
sion comes at the right time to achieve gradual improve-
ment of the system. However, due to its slower response
rate, biomechanical adaptation is still incomplete, meaning
that the next biomechanical load arrives at a time when the
tissue is still weakened, causing gradual degeneration until
a critical weakness and tissue failure may be reached (as
indicated by the star in Fig. 2). Perhaps the amount of
biomechanical load should be reduced at times of weakness
(dashed biomechanical load block with dashed biome-
chanical adaptation line at time point 2), allowing for
supercompensation in the tissue properties to take place
before a higher biomechanical load is delivered at time
point 3. This theoretical example of how periodization
could pursue optimal sequencing of load is only possible if
one is able to separately control physiological and biome-
chanical load. In the next section, we will discuss a couple
of examples of how this can be achieved in running-based
team sports.
5 Differentiating Physiological and Biomechanical
Load
Separate modification of physiological and biomechanical
load is already common practise in the rehabilitation of
lower extremity musculoskeletal injuries. Aqua jogging
exercises and, more recently, exercises on an anti-gravity
(also called lower-body positive pressure) treadmill have
become common practice during the rehabilitation of ath-
letic injuries [74]. Such exercises aim to provide physio-
logical load with reduced biomechanical load, and, for both
types of exercises, ground reaction forces are reduced by
up to 20% depending on modality [75, 76]. The benefit of
these exercises is that despite low biomechanical load, they
involve walking or running locomotion that in the case of
aqua jogging is only slightly altered due to water resistance
[77], therefore these are favoured against cycling exercises,
even if tissue loading due to impact is known to be neg-
ligible during cycling. Another example of load differen-
tiation can be found in the load alterations, as observed
when playing small-sided games. Studies have found that
reducing pitch size reduces the physiological load [78, 79]
but likely increases the biomechanical load [79, 80].
Another example is the use of high-intensity interval
training (HIT) which delivers a high physiological load but
with low biomechanical load. As suggested in a recent
review on HIT [81], this could therefore be a practical
example of the alternative training session that one may
wish to schedule at time points 2 and 4 in Fig. 2. A final
example is running on sand, where it was found to be

 possible to perform maximal intensity sprints involving
high physiological load but reduce the biomechanical load
(impact) considerably compared with what is typically
experienced on a harder surface (e.g. concrete or grass)
[82].
6 Conclusions
Huge amounts of data can be monitored on a daily basis.
Turning these data into relevant information for players,
coaches and therapists can be an extremely daunting
challenge for a novice sports scientist entering the profes-
sional sporting environment. With this paper, we would
like to encourage not only sport scientists to pursue further
research according to a framework that differentiates
physiological and biomechanical load-adaptation path-
ways, but also the broader coaching and sports medical
staff in running-based team sports to venture into some of
the biomechanical literature reviewed in this paper and
sharpen their views on how monitoring training load can be
a valuable tool for improving performance while prevent-
ing injury.
