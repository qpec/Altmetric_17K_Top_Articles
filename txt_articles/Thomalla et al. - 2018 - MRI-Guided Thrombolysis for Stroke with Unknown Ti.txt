BACKGROUND
Under current guidelines, intravenous thrombolysis is used to treat acute stroke only if 
it can be ascertained that the time since the onset of symptoms was less than 4.5 hours. 
We sought to determine whether patients with stroke with an unknown time of onset 
and features suggesting recent cerebral infarction on magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) would benefit from thrombolysis with the use of intravenous alteplase.
METHODS
In a multicenter trial, we randomly assigned patients who had an unknown time 
of onset of stroke to receive either intravenous alteplase or placebo. All the patients 
had an ischemic lesion that was visible on MRI diffusion-weighted imaging but no 
parenchymal hyperintensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), which 
indicated that the stroke had occurred approximately within the previous 4.5 hours. 
We excluded patients for whom thrombectomy was planned. The primary end point 
was favorable outcome, as defined by a score of 0 or 1 on the modified Rankin scale 
of neurologic disability (which ranges from 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) at 90 days. 
A secondary outcome was the likelihood that alteplase would lead to lower ordinal 
scores on the modified Rankin scale than would placebo (shift analysis).
RESULTS
The trial was stopped early owing to cessation of funding after the enrollment of 503 
of an anticipated 800 patients. Of these patients, 254 were randomly assigned to re-
ceive alteplase and 249 to receive placebo. A favorable outcome at 90 days was re-
ported in 131 of 246 patients (53.3%) in the alteplase group and in 102 of 244 patients 
(41.8%) in the placebo group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.09 to 2.36; P 
= 
0.02). The median score on the modified Rankin scale at 90 days 
was 1 in the alteplase group and 2 in the placebo group (adjusted common odds ratio, 
1.62; 95% CI, 1.17 to 2.23; P 
= 
0.003). There were 10 deaths (4.1%) in the alteplase group 
and 3 (1.2%) in the placebo group (odds ratio, 3.38; 95% CI, 0.92 to 12.52; P 
= 
0.07). 
The rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was 2.0% in the alteplase group and 
0.4% in the placebo group (odds ratio, 4.95; 95% CI, 0.57 to 42.87; P 
= 
0.15).
CONCLUSIONS
In patients with acute stroke with an unknown time of onset, intravenous alteplase 
guided by a mismatch between diffusion-weighted imaging and FLAIR in the region 
of ischemia resulted in a significantly better functional outcome and numerically more 
intracranial hemorrhages than placebo at 90 days. (Funded by the European Union

I
ntravenous thrombolysis with al-
teplase, a recombinant tissue plasminogen 
activator, is the standard medical treatment 
for acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours after 
the onset of symptoms.1-4 In 14 to 27% of strokes, 
the time of symptom onset is not known, fre-
quently because stroke symptoms are recognized 
when the patient awakes from sleeping.5,6 Such 
patients are generally excluded from treatment 
with intravenous alteplase, and only some of them 
are candidates for mechanical thrombectomy.
A substantial proportion of strokes that are 
evident after sleep probably occur in the last few 
hours before awakening, which would be within 
the approved time window for the use of intra-
venous thrombolysis.7 Magnetic resonance imag-
ing (MRI) in patients with stroke with a known 
time of symptom onset has identified the pres-
ence of a visible ischemic lesion on diffusion-
weighted imaging, combined with the absence 
of a clearly visible hyperintense signal in the same 
region on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery 
(FLAIR), as predictive of symptom onset within 
4.5 hours before imaging.8-11 We conducted the 
Efficacy and Safety of MRI-Based Thrombolysis 
in Wake-Up Stroke (WAKE-UP) trial to deter-
mine whether treatment with alteplase would 
improve functional outcomes in patients with an 
unknown time of stroke onset and a mismatch 
between diffusion-weighted imaging and FLAIR 
findings on MRI.12
Methods
Trial Design
WAKE-UP was an investigator-initiated, multi-
center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-con-
trolled clinical trial involving patients with an 
unknown time of onset of stroke. All the pa-
tients otherwise met the clinical criteria for in-
travenous thrombolysis. Patients could undergo 
randomization if in the judgment of the investi-
gator MRI showed an acute ischemic lesion on 
diffusion-weighted imaging but no parenchymal 
hyperintensity with standard window settings on 
FLAIR (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, 
available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org).
The trial protocol (also available at NEJM.org) 
was approved by the national regulatory author-
ity in each participating country. The trial was 
approved by the national or local ethics commit-
tee or institutional review board. Patients or their 
legal representatives provided written informed 
consent according to national and local regula-
tions. There was an exception from explicit in-
formed consent in emergency circumstances in 
some countries, as described previously.13
The trial, which was supported by the Euro-
pean Union Seventh Framework Program, was 
performed at 70 centers in eight European coun-
tries. Sites were selected if they were experienced 
stroke research centers, had a history of routine 
use of alteplase in standard stroke care, and could 
perform MRI for emergency stroke imaging. In-
vestigators were certified by Web-based training 
on image interpretation and were certified in the 
use of the clinical examination scales for entry 
criteria and outcome assessment. A central im-
age-reading committee reviewed all images ac-
quired for patient enrollment, evaluated the de-
cisions of local investigators regarding imaging 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, and provided 
feedback on disagreements on these matters to 
trial sites.
The trial was overseen by a steering commit-
tee and an independent data and safety monitor-
ing board. The authors vouch for the accuracy 
and completeness of the data and adverse event 
reporting and for the fidelity of the trial to the 
protocol. There was no industry funding or in-
volvement in any aspect of the trial.
Patients
Patients were eligible if they presented with 
clinical signs of acute stroke, were 18 to 80 years 
of age, and had been able to carry out usual ac-
tivities in their daily life without support before 
the stroke. The patient either recognized stroke 
symptoms on awakening or could not report the 
timing of the onset of symptoms (e.g., as a result 
of aphasia or confusion). The time that had elapsed 
since the patient was last known to be well had to 
be more than 4.5 hours (with no upper limit) in 
order to exclude patients who otherwise would 
have fulfilled the standard eligibility criteria for 
the use of alteplase. Patients underwent MRI ex-
amination that included diffusion-weighted imag-
ing, FLAIR, a sequence sensitive to hemorrhage, 
and time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiogra-
phy of the circle of Willis. Patients underwent 
randomization if they had a mismatch between 
the presence of an abnormal signal on MRI dif-
fusion-weighted imaging and no visible signal

change on FLAIR in the region of the acute stroke. 
Patients were excluded if MRI showed intracranial 
hemorrhage or lesions larger than one third of 
the territory of the middle cerebral artery. Also 
excluded from the trial were patients in whom 
thrombectomy was planned and those with se-
vere stroke, which was defined as a score of more 
than 25 on the National Institute of Health 
Stroke Scale (NIHSS), which ranges from 0 to 42, 
with higher values indicating a greater neuro-
logic deficit. Patients were also excluded if they 
had generally recognized contraindications to 
treatment with alteplase (except for the unknown 
time of symptom onset).14
Randomization and Treatment
Patients underwent randomization by means of 
a Web-based procedure with a permuted-block 
design according to trial center. Patients were 
assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 0.9 mg of alteplase 
per kilogram of body weight (with 10% admin-
istered as a bolus and the remainder by infusion 
during a 60-minute period) or matching placebo. 
Randomization was stratified according to age 
(≤60 or >60 years) and severity of symptoms as 
assessed on the NIHSS (score, ≤10 or >10). Con-
comitant treatment and procedures were per-
formed according to the standard of care at each 
center in compliance with European or national 
guidelines for acute stroke.14
Clinical and Imaging Assessment
Clinical assessments were performed at baseline, 
at 22 to 36 hours after randomization, at 5 to 
9 days (or at hospital discharge, if earlier), and 
at 90 days. Assessments included a recording of 
demographic characteristics, taking of a medical 
history, evaluation of laboratory values and scores 
on the NIHSS, an assessment of disability on the 
basis of the modified Rankin scale (which ranges 
from 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]), a review of 
concomitant medications, and an assessment of 
adverse events. Brain MRI was performed at base-
line and 22 to 36 hours after randomization to 
detect intracranial hemorrhage and to assess in-
farct volume.
Outcome Measures
The primary efficacy end point was a favorable 
clinical outcome, which was defined as a score 
of 0 or 1 on the modified Rankin scale 90 days 
after randomization. Secondary efficacy end points 
were the ordinal score on the modified Rankin 
scale at 90 days; the proportion of patients with 
a treatment response at 90 days (defined as a score 
on the modified Rankin scale of 0 for patients 
with an NIHSS score of ≤7, a score of 0 or 1 for 
patients with an NIHSS score of 8 to 14, and a 
score of 0 to 2 for patients with an NIHSS score 
of >14); a global outcome score at 90 days, which 
was defined as a good outcome on four scales 
(a score of 0 or 1 on the modified Rankin scale 
and the NIHSS, a score of 95 to 100 on the Bar-
thel Index [which assesses 10 categories of daily 
function and ranges from 0 to 100, with higher 
values indicating better independent function], 
and a score of 5 on the Glasgow Outcome Scale 
[which ranges from 1 to 5, with higher values 
indicating better neurologic recovery]); the 90-day 
score on the Beck Depression Inventory (which 
ranges from 0 to 63, with higher scores indicat-
ing more severe depressive symptoms); 90-day 
scores on two EuroQol–5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) 
scales (including a total score that ranges from 
0 to 10, with higher values indicating greater 
problems across five dimensions of self-care and 
self-assessment of well-being, and a score on a 
visual analogue scale that ranges from 0 to 100, 
with higher scores indicating better health); and 
infarct volume on MRI 22 to 36 hours after ran-
domization.
The primary safety end points were death and 
a composite outcome of death or dependence, 
which was defined as a score of 4 to 6 on the 
modified Rankin scale at 90 days. Secondary 
safety end points were symptomatic intracranial 
hemorrhage causing deterioration in neurologic 
symptoms2,3,15-17 and the incidence of parenchy-
mal hematoma type 2 (as defined by clots ex-
ceeding 30% of the infarct area) on MRI 22 to 
36 hours after randomization.15 The central im-
age-reading board assessed the outcome on MRI 
at 22 to 36 hours in a blinded manner. Symptom-
atic intracranial hemorrhage was evaluated by a 
central safety-adjudication committee whose mem-
bers were unaware of trial-group assignments.
Statistical Analysis
Primary and secondary efficacy outcomes were 
assessed in the intention-to-treat population, 
which included all the patients who had under-
gone randomization. The primary efficacy out-
come was determined with the use of an uncon-
ditional logistic-regression model fitted to estimate

the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval.18 The 
secondary efficacy outcome of the score on the 
modified Rankin scale was analyzed by fitting a 
proportional-odds logistic-regression model to 
calculate the common odds ratio as a measure 
of the likelihood that alteplase would lead to 
lower scores on the modified Rankin scale than 
would placebo (shift analysis). The global out-
come score was analyzed with the use of a global 
estimate of the odds ratio (Wald-type test) from 
generalized estimation equations based on a 
linear logistic-regression model. Odds ratios and 
common odds ratios were adjusted for stratifica-
tion factors of age and symptom severity at 
randomization. Analyses of secondary outcomes 
were not corrected for multiple comparisons, so 
the results cannot be used for hypothesis testing 
or inference. Post hoc Bonferroni-corrected re-
sults of secondary outcome analyses were calcu-
lated for reference with the P values of secondary 
outcomes. Missing data in the primary outcome 
analysis were imputed with the use of multiple 
imputation techniques (five imputed data sets),18 
with prediction based on trial group, baseline 
age, baseline NIHSS score, and NIHSS score 
measured on day 7. Analyses were performed 
with a two-sided alpha level of 0.05.
The same analyses were repeated in the per-
protocol population after the exclusion of all the 
patients who had major protocol violations. 
Safety end points were assessed in the safety 
population with the use of an unconditional lo-
gistic-regression model to estimate the odds ra-
tio and 95% confidence intervals associated with 
treatment effect, after adjustment for the strati-
fication factors used at randomization. In the 
safety population, patients who received any 
amount of alteplase were assigned to the al-
teplase group; all other patients who received 
any amount of placebo were assigned to the 
placebo group. The sample-size calculation was 
based on pooled data from trials of thromboly-
sis for the treatment of stroke,19 with an ex-
pected absolute between-group difference of 10 
percentage points in the proportion of patients 
with the primary efficacy outcome. We calcu-
lated that 370 patients per group would be re-
quired to provide a power of 80% to show the 
expected treatment effect. Taking into account 
possible protocol violations and dropouts, we in-
tended to enroll 800 patients (400 per trial group).
Results
Characteristics of the Patients
The steering committee stopped enrollment on 
June 30, 2017, on the basis of the anticipated 
cessation of funding from the European Union. 
The decision to discontinue enrollment was made 
without an interim analysis of trial data.
From September 24, 2012, to June 30, 2017, a 
total of 1362 patients underwent screening at 61 
centers in eight European countries. Of these pa-
tients, 859 were excluded, including 455 who had 
no mismatch between findings on MRI diffusion-
weighted imaging and FLAIR and 15 for whom 
thrombectomy was planned (Fig. 1). A total of 503 
patients underwent randomization, as compared 
with the anticipated enrollment of 800 patients.
Of the 503 enrolled patients, 254 were assigned 
to receive alteplase and 249 to receive placebo. 
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, 
including the interval from the time that the pa-
tients were last known to be well until the time 
of the initiation of treatment, were not signifi-
cantly different between the groups, except for a 
higher rate of intracranial occlusion of the inter-
nal carotid artery in the alteplase group (Table 1). 
The median NIHSS score at the time of the base-
line examination was 6 in the two groups. The 
most frequent reason for an unknown time of 
onset of stroke symptoms was that the patient 
had awakened from nighttime sleep with stroke 
symptoms (89% in the two groups). The median 
time between symptom recognition and admin-
istration of alteplase or placebo was 3.1 hours in 
the alteplase group and 3.2 hours in the placebo 
group; the median interval between the time that 
the patient was last known to be well and treat-
ment initiation was 10.3 hours and 10.4 hours, 
respectively.
A total of 5 patients in the alteplase group and 
4 patients in the placebo group did not receive the 
assigned drug. Of these patients, 1 from each 
group received open-label treatment with alteplase. 
Thus, 251 patients who received alteplase and 244 
patients who received placebo were included in 
the safety population. A total of 13 patients in 
the intention-to-treat population (8 in the al-
teplase group and 5 in the placebo group) and 
10 patients in the safety population (7 in the 
alteplase group and 3 in the placebo group) were 
lost to follow-up.

Efficacy Outcomes
Treatment with alteplase was associated with a 
favorable outcome (a score of 0 or 1 on the 
modified Rankin scale) at 90 days in 131 of 246 
patients (53.3%) in the alteplase group and in 
102 of 244 patients (41.8%) in the placebo group 
(adjusted odds ratio, 1.61; 95% confidence inter-
val [CI], 1.09 to 2.36; P 
= 
0.02) (Table 2). Because 
of the absence of correction for multiple testing, 
the P values for secondary outcomes cannot be 
used for hypothesis testing or inference. For ref-
erence, post hoc Bonferroni adjustment for mul-
tiple comparisons of secondary outcomes required 
a significance level of P<0.007. The median score 
on the modified Rankin scale at 90 days was 1 
(interquartile range, 1 to 3) in the alteplase group 
and 2 (interquartile range, 1 to 3) in the placebo 
group (common odds ratio, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.17 to

tion of patients who had a treatment response at 
90 days that was defined in relation to the sever-
ity of stroke at baseline was higher in the alteplase 
group than in the placebo group (72 of 246 pa-
tients [29.3%] and 44 of 244 patients [18.0%], re-
spectively). Measures of quality of life at 90 days 
(including the scores on two EQ-5D scales) nu-
merically favored treatment with alteplase, but 
the infarct volume at 22 to 36 hours after random-
ization was similar in the two groups (3 ml in the 
alteplase group and 3.3 ml in the placebo group), 
and the global outcome scores were numerically 
similar (Table 2). The effect of alteplase on the 
global outcome score was not significant after

Odds ratios, common odds ratios, and differences are for the alteplase group, as compared with the placebo group. Odds ratios and com-

ple comparisons.
‡  
A favorable outcome was defined as a score of 0 or 1 on the modified Rankin scale of neurologic disability (which ranges from 0 [no symp-
toms] to 6 [death]) at 90 days. A total of 8 patients in the alteplase group and 5 in the placebo group were lost to follow-up.
§ 
 
The between-group comparison of median scores on the modified Rankin scale was analyzed by means of a logistic-regression model.
¶  
P values and confidence intervals for secondary outcomes have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons and cannot be used for hy-
pothesis testing or inference. The values are shown for reference to a post hoc calculation of a P value adjusted for seven secondary out-
come comparisons. Post hoc adjustment for multiple comparisons of secondary outcomes by means of the Bonferroni method required a 
significance level of P<0.007.

A correlation between the treatment response at 90 days and the deficit level at baseline was defined as a score of 0 on the modified 
Rankin scale among patients with mild deficits at study entry (NIHSS score, ≤7), a score of 0 or 1 among patients with moderate deficits 
(NIHSS score, 8 to 14), and a score of 0 to 2 among patients with severe deficits (NIHSS score, >14).
**  
The Global Outcome Score is a multidimensional calculation of a favorable outcome that combines the estimation of treatment effect on 
four different scales into a single odds ratio, so there is no corresponding global numerator. The four measures are a score or 0 or 1 on 
the modified Rankin scale and on the NIHSS, a score of 95 to 100 on the Barthel Index (which assesses 10 categories of daily function 
and ranges from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating better independent function), and a score of 5 on the Glasgow Outcome Scale 
(which ranges from 1 to 5, with higher values indicating better neurologic recovery).
††  
Scores on the Beck Depression Inventory range from 0 to 63, with higher scores indicating more severe depressive symptoms.
‡‡  
Total scores on the EQ-5D scale range from 0 to 10, with higher values indicating more problems across the five dimensions of mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression.
§§  
Scores on the EQ-5D visual analog scale range from 0 (indicating the worst imaginable health state) to 100 (indicating the best imagin-
able health state).

The infarct volume was measured on diffusion-weighted imaging 22 to 36 hours after randomization. The final infarct volume was missing 
for 27 patients in the alteplase group and 15 in the placebo group.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
In the per-protocol population, treatment with 
alteplase was associated with an adjusted odds 
ratio of the primary efficacy outcome of 1.54 
(95% CI, 1.02 to 2.32; P 
= 
0.04) (Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Safety Outcomes
In the safety population at 90 days, death or an 
inability to live independently (score on the 
modified Rankin scale, 4 to 6) occurred in 33 of 
244 patients (13.5%) in the alteplase group and 
44 of 241 patients (18.3%) in the placebo group 
(adjusted odds ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.18; 
P 
= 
0.17) (Table 3). Death was reported in 10 pa-
tients (4.1%) in the alteplase group and in 3 pa-
tients (1.2%) in the placebo group (adjusted odds 
ratio, 3.38; 95% CI, 0.92 to 12.52; P 
= 
0.07). In 
the alteplase group, 4 deaths were attributed to 
symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and 1 to 
recurrent ischemic stroke 12 days after treatment. 
The other 5 deaths were attributed to noncerebral 
causes unrelated to the initial stroke or treat-
ment. In one of the patients who died from symp-
tomatic intracranial hemorrhage, the central im-
age-reading board determined that the initial 
lesion volume exceeded one third of the territory 
of the middle cerebral artery, which constituted 
a violation of the protocol for inclusion in the 
trial. A second patient who died had uncontrolled 
hypertension within the first hours after treat-
ment. The other 2 patients who died from symp-
tomatic intracranial hemorrhage had been treat-
ed according to the protocol.
Parenchymal hemorrhage type 2 occurred 
more frequently in the alteplase group (4.0%) 
than in the placebo group (0.4%; adjusted odds 
ratio, 10.46; 95% CI, 1.32 to 82.77; P 
= 
0.03). No 
significant difference between groups was ob-
served for various definitions of symptomatic 
intracranial hemorrhage, although the frequency 
of such events was higher in the alteplase group 
(Table 3). The rate of symptomatic intracranial 
hemorrhage according to the definition of the 
Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke 
Monitoring Study16 was 2.0% in the alteplase 
group versus 0.4% in the placebo group (P 
= 
0.15). 
Recurrent symptomatic ischemic stroke and 
space-occupying brain infarction were more fre-
quent with alteplase than with placebo (6.8% vs. 
3.3% for recurrent symptomatic stroke and 2.4% 
vs. 0.8% for brain infarction).
In the alteplase group, 56 patients (22.3%) had 
at least one serious adverse event, as compared 
with 52 patients (21.3%) in the placebo group 
(P 
= 
0.83). Serious adverse events in the category 
of nervous system disorders, which included 
symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and recur-
rent stroke, were more frequent with alteplase 
than with placebo (13.5% vs. 8.6%). A detailed 
list of serious adverse events is provided in Table 
S4 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Analysis of Prespecified Subgroups
Early discontinuation of the trial did not provide 
adequate statistical power to analyze differences 
in subgroups. No evidence of heterogeneity of 
treatment effect was detected in the two prespeci-
fied subgroups of age and severity of stroke as 
assessed on the NIHSS (Fig. S2 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
Discussion
In this trial involving patients with an unknown 
time of onset of stroke who presented with MRI 
findings of an ischemic lesion on diffusion-
weighted imaging but no clearly visible signal 
change in the corresponding region on FLAIR, 
Figure 2. Distribution of Scores on the Modified Rankin Scale at 90 Days 
(Intention-to-Treat Population).
Shown are the differences in the scores on the modified Rankin scale 
among patients in the alteplase group and the placebo group at 90 days. 
Scores range from 0 to 6, with 0 indicating no symptoms, 1 no clinically 
significant disability, 2 slight disability, 3 moderate disability, 4 moderately 
severe disability, 5 severe disability, and 6 death. Numbers indicate round-
ed proportions. There was a significant difference favoring the alteplase 
group over the placebo group in the overall distribution of scores (adjusted 
common odds ratio, 1.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.17 to 2.23; P = 0.003).

The primary safety outcome was analyzed in 244 patients in the alteplase group and in 241 in the placebo group be-
cause of loss to follow-up.
‡  
The definition of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage according to the Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in 
Stroke Monitoring Study (SITS–MOST) was local or remote parenchymal hematoma type 2 on the imaging scan ob-
tained 22 to 36 hours after treatment, plus neurologic deterioration, as indicated by a score on the NIHSS that was 
higher by 4 points or more than the baseline value or the lowest value between baseline and 24 hours, or hemorrhage 
leading to death.
§ 
 
The definition according to the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS) II was any hemorrhage with neuro-
logic deterioration, as indicated by an NIHSS score that was higher by 4 points or more than the value at baseline or 
the lowest value in the first 7 days, or any hemorrhage leading to death.
¶  
The definition according to ECASS III was the same as that in ECASS II, plus the hemorrhage must have been identi-
fied as the predominant cause of the neurologic deterioration.
‖ 
 
The definition according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) was any new hemor-
rhage associated with any neurologic deterioration.
**  
Parenchymal hemorrhage type 2 was defined as an intracerebral hemorrhage that involved more than 30% of the in-
farcted area with a substantial space-occupying effect or that was remote from the original infarcted area.
††  
Other safety outcomes were determined by the safety adjudication committee on the basis of the evaluation of clini-
cal and imaging information. Odds ratios and P values were not calculated for these comparisons.
‡‡  
Asymptomatic recurrent stroke was defined as any new lesion on follow-up MRI that was not considered to be a 
growth of the original stroke lesion.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
the functional outcome at 90 days was more fa-
vorable among the patients who received intrave-
nous thrombolysis with alteplase than among 
those who received placebo. This MRI mismatch 
pattern was chosen because it suggests that the 
stroke occurred within approximately the previ-
ous 4.5 hours, the accepted interval for treat-
ment with thrombolysis. In this selected group 
of patients with stroke, those in the alteplase 
group had a rate of freedom from neurologic 
deficit or major disability that was 11.5 percent-
age points higher than that in the placebo group 
at 90 days. Intravenous alteplase was associated 
with numerically better scores on the modified 
Rankin scale and with a shift toward better out-
comes in all categories on the scale than was 
placebo.
Since we enrolled patients with an unknown 
time of symptom onset, they would have been 
excluded from most previous trials of throm-
bolysis involving patients with stroke. A pooled 
analysis of previous trials of intravenous throm-
bolysis showed a time-dependent effect of drug 
administration on outcome, with a significant 
benefit for alteplase within 4.5 hours after symp-
tom onset.1 In our trial, patients were selected 
on the basis of mismatch between findings on 
MRI diffusion-weighted imaging and FLAIR.11,12 
Interobserver agreement for this combination of 
findings was 73 to 78% in two previous stud-
ies.11,20 The presence of intracranial-artery occlu-
sion or penumbral pattern before thrombolysis 
was not a prerequisite for randomization in the 
trial, and we did not assess recanalization or re-
perfusion as a biologic marker of treatment ef-
fectiveness.
Approximately two thirds of the patients who 
were screened in our trial did not undergo ran-
domization, mainly because they did not have 
the mismatch pattern of recent stroke on MRI 
required for enrollment. The exclusion of patients 
who planned to undergo thrombectomy limits 
the generalization of our findings. It is possible 
that some patients with severe stroke from large-
vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation were 
not enrolled in our trial and were treated with 
thrombectomy outside the trial. We have no sys-
tematic information on the availability of endo-
vascular thrombectomy in the centers that par-
ticipated in the trial, and the inception of these 
services changed during the conduct of the trial 
as a result of studies that showed a benefit for 
thrombectomy in patients with stroke with large-
vessel occlusion on the basis of various imaging 
characteristics. The results of two clinical trials, 
DAWN (DWI [Diffusion-Weighted Imaging] or 
CTP [Computed Tomographic Perfusion] Assess-
ment with Clinical Mismatch in the Triage of 
Wake-Up and Late Presenting Strokes Undergo-
ing Neurointervention with Trevo)21 and DEFUSE 
3 (Endovascular Therapy Following Imaging Eval-
uation for Ischemic Stroke),22 showed a benefit 
for mechanical thrombectomy in patients with 
stroke with an unknown time of symptom onset, 
severe stroke, and large-vessel occlusion and be-
came available after enrollment in our trial was 
stopped. In our trial, approximately 20% of the 
patients had an occlusion of a large intracranial 
artery and would have qualified for treatment 
with thrombectomy in DAWN and DEFUSE 3.
Our trial provides evidence of benefit from 
reperfusion treatment with alteplase in patients 
with minor or moderate stroke who would not 
usually be eligible for endovascular treatment. 
The treatment effect of alteplase among patients 
with mild or moderate stroke of the type included 
in our trial is consistent with a pooled analysis of 
thrombolysis trials, which did not show a signifi-
cant difference in the efficacy of alteplase treat-
ment depending on stroke severity.23
There were numerically more deaths and sig-
nificantly more patients with type 2 parenchy-
mal hemorrhage in the alteplase group than in 
the placebo group. This finding was similar to 
that in a pooled analysis of stroke thrombolysis 
trials that showed a trend toward an increased 
rate of death associated with alteplase treat-
ment.19,21 The incidence of symptomatic intracra-
nial hemorrhage was higher in the alteplase group 
in our trial regardless of the definition used to 
denote this complication, which was consistent 
with the findings of previous trials of thromboly-
sis for the treatment of stroke.21 The trial was 
stopped early because of a discontinuation of 
funding and enrolled fewer patients than planned. 
This factor limits the interpretation of the safety 
results because the observed trend toward a higher 
rate of death in the alteplase group may have be-
come significant with a larger sample size.
The analysis in prespecified subgroups did 
not reveal heterogeneity in treatment effect ac-
cording to the score (≤10 or >10) on the NIHSS. 
However, the small number of patients with an 
NIHSS score of more than 10 limits the validity

of the subgroup analysis. Despite the clinical ben-
efit of alteplase, the infarct volume on MRI at 22 
to 36 hours after randomization was not signifi-
cantly different between the two trial groups. This 
finding is similar to the results of DEFUSE 3,23 
in which the clinical benefit of thrombectomy 
was not reflected by a smaller infarct volume at 
24 hours.
In conclusion, among patients with acute 
stroke and an unknown time of symptom onset 
who had MRI findings of an ischemic lesion on 
diffusion-weighted imaging but no parenchymal 
hyperintensity in the corresponding region on 
FLAIR, intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase 
resulted in a better functional outcome than treat-
ment with placebo.
