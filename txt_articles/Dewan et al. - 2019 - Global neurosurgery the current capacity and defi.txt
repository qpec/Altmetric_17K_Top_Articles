OBJECTIVE Worldwide disparities in the provision of surgical care result in otherwise preventable disability and death. 
There is a growing need to quantify the global burden of neurosurgical disease specifically, and the workforce necessary 
to meet this demand.
METHODS Results from a multinational collaborative effort to describe the global neurosurgical burden were aggre-
gated and summarized. First, country registries, third-party modeled data, and meta-analyzed published data were com-
bined to generate incidence and volume figures for 10 common neurosurgical conditions. Next, a global mapping survey 
was performed to identify the number and location of neurosurgeons in each country. Finally, a practitioner survey was 
conducted to quantify the proportion of disease requiring surgery, as well as the median number of neurosurgical cases 
per annum. The neurosurgical case deficit was calculated as the difference between the volume of essential neurosurgi-
cal cases and the existing neurosurgical workforce capacity.
RESULTS Every year, an estimated 22.6 million patients suffer from neurological disorders or injuries that warrant the 
expertise of a neurosurgeon, of whom 13.8 million require surgery. Traumatic brain injury, stroke-related conditions, 
tumors, hydrocephalus, and epilepsy constitute the majority of essential neurosurgical care worldwide. Approximately 
23,300 additional neurosurgeons are needed to address more than 5 million essential neurosurgical cases—all in low- 
and middle-income countries—that go unmet each year. There exists a gross disparity in the allocation of the surgical 
workforce, leaving large geographic treatment gaps, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia.
CONCLUSIONS Each year, more than 5 million individuals suffering from treatable neurosurgical conditions will never 
undergo therapeutic surgical intervention. Populations in Africa and Southeast Asia, where the proportion of neurosur-
geons to neurosurgical disease is critically low, are especially at risk. Increasing access to essential neurosurgical care 
in low- and middle-income countries via neurosurgical workforce expansion as part of surgical system strengthening is 
necessary to prevent severe disability and death for millions with neurological disease.

n 2015, the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery of-
fered a summary of the surgical burden and described 
existing gaps in the provision of safe and affordable 
surgical care worldwide.11 More than two-thirds of the 
world’s population lack access to appropriate surgical and 
anesthetic care, equating to an estimated 143 million nec-
essary surgical procedures that are left undone. This un-
treated surgical disease results in extreme economic costs 
and profound disability and death.17
Within this tremendous burden of surgical disease re-
sides the contribution of neurosurgical disease. Obtaining 
a reliable estimate of the volume of neurosurgical disease 
requires addressing numerous challenges including sparse 
epidemiological data, heterogeneous literature reporting, 
and even competing definitions of disease entities. Fur-
thermore, quantifying the existing workforce of surgeons 
capable of safely addressing neurological disease is dif-
ficult. There exists neither a single worldwide registry of 
neurosurgeons, nor even a consensus as to the requisite 
training and competencies of a neurosurgeon.
Despite debate about the nature of neurosurgical dis-
ease and those capable of addressing it,1 there is grow-
ing recognition of a worldwide shortage of neurosurgeons, 
particularly in low-resourced settings.2,13,20 Before pursu-
ing a targeted campaign to stem the disparity in special-
ized surgical care, a more definitive understanding of the 
problem is essential, including regions with the greatest 
need. In this report we summarize a body of research by 
the Program in Global Surgery and Social Change aimed 
at establishing the current status of neurosurgery world-
wide. Thus, we provide estimates of the global volume of 
neurosurgical disease, the existing neurosurgical capacity, 
and the current unmet neurosurgical need worldwide.
Methods
Volume of Neurosurgical Disease
We began by estimating the incidence of 10 conditions 
encountered by neurosurgeons that form the foundation 
of essential neurosurgical care: brain and spinal tumors, 
hydrocephalus, traumatic brain injury (TBI), traumatic 
spinal injury (TSI), neural tube defects, stroke, CNS vas-
cular anomalies, CNS infections, and epilepsy. Conditions 
were identified by ranking commonly treated neurosur-
gical conditions described by an international panel of 
neurosurgical providers (see Proportion Requiring Neu-
rosurgery below). Then, those conditions in which treat-
ment neglect would directly result in severe disability or 
death were designated by this report as essential neuro-
surgical conditions. Notably excluded from the final list 
are degenerative spine disease and osteoporotic vertebral 
fractures.15 The proportion and volume of patients suc-
cumbing to severe disability or death if these conditions 
are not treated surgically is difficult to determine, particu-
larly in resource-limited settings. Due to the recognition 
of limited capacity, this classification scheme of essential 
neurosurgical care also excluded important conditions 
such as pain disorders, spasticity, movement disorders, 
and other conditions for which neurosurgical treatment 
might offset disability and lost productivity. Competency 
with the treatment of the 10 conditions above, however, 
would equip a neurosurgeon anywhere with the ability to 
treat the vast majority of patients with neurosurgical dis-
ease, and thereby most efficiently avert severe disability or 
premature death.
Reliable epidemiological figures were available for 
two diseases (neural tube defect and stroke; http://ghdx.
healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool),10 thus our attention was 
focused on the remaining conditions. National surgical 
registries were available for brain and spinal tumors al-
lowing region-specific estimation of disease incidence.3 
The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation has pub-
lished epidemiological figures for road traffic injuries in 
each country, which were used to extrapolate the inci-
dence of TBI. The proportion of traffic collisions result-
ing in TBI was calculated via a meta-analysis of published 
traffic injury data. Similarly, the proportion of TBI from 
which traffic collisions is the mechanism of action was 
calculated via a meta-analysis. Applying these ratios to the 
incidence of road traffic injuries delivered an estimation of 
total TBI from all causes.6
For the remaining conditions (hydrocephalus, TSI, 
CNS vascular anomalies, CNS infections, and epilepsy), 
an exhaustive systematic review was conducted to identify 
studies reporting epidemiological data from large, popu-
lation-based cohorts. After extracting case numbers and 
sample size, a meta-analysis was performed to estimate 
disease incidence figures for each disease by WHO re-
gion and by World Bank income group. Finally, incidence 
figures were multiplied by population estimates from the 
WHO to generate estimates for the annual volume of dis-
ease globally. Detailed methodology and results are de-
scribed in detail elsewhere.3,7–9,11,16,19
Proportion Requiring Neurosurgery
Identifying the incidence of neurosurgical disease re-
quires an estimate of the proportion of neurological injury 
or illness warranting surgical intervention. Some neu-
rosurgical diseases are best managed operatively, while 
others require nonoperative neurosurgical management. 
Some neurological conditions do not require neurosurgi-
cal expertise for optimal treatment. While surgical logs 
from ideal health care systems offer reliable estimates 
for surgical proportion (i.e., the fraction of neurological 
conditions requiring surgery), their relevance may not be 
generalizable to health care systems in differing settings. 
Furthermore, we learn very little about the proportion of 
disease benefiting from nonoperative neurosurgical ex-
pertise or consultation. Thus, following the precedent es-
tablished by the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery, 
we sought expert opinion from a broad, diverse group of 
surgical providers.
Via electronic survey, nearly 200 neurosurgeons from 
more than 50 countries were asked to estimate the pro-
portion of specific neurological disorders that, in an ideal 
world, would require either neurosurgical operation or 
consultation. To gauge degree of certainty, surgeons in-
dicated how confident they were in their estimation for 
each disease. Finally, we sought to identify the number of 
cases that can be reasonably performed each year by the 
average practicing neurosurgeon. Surgeons indicated their 
annual case volume and types of cases most frequently

performed, then indicated how they perceived their work-
load at that clinical volume. The full questionnaire and 
analytical methodology are described in detail elsewhere.5
Neurosurgical Workforce
Determination of the current neurosurgical workforce 
was quantified via a large, multinational global mapping 
project facilitated by the World Federation of Neurosur-
gical Societies (WFNS), the WHO, and the Program in 
Global Surgery and Social Change (PGSSC) at Harvard 
Medical School. Briefly, Ministries of Health, officers of 
the 130 societies registered with the WFNS, and the mem-
bers of the WHO Global Initiative for Emergency and 
Essential Care were contacted via email for information. 
For some countries an internet search was conducted to 
identify the contact information for active neurosurgeons 
willing and able to complete an online questionnaire on 
capacity. Surgeons registered with the open access Glob-
al Neurosurgery forum (https://globalneurosurgery.org/
members) were also included. The data collection instru-
ment captured surgeon numbers and geographic locations, 
as well as the presence of basic equipment germane to 
neurosurgical care: high-speed drills, bipolar electrocau-
tery, imaging infrastructure, etc. For the purposes of the 
current summary, we aggregated the number of neurosur-
geons by country and by WHO region to facilitate quanti-
fication of the current surgical capacity. A comprehensive 
description of the methodology and results of the PGSSC 
workforce mapping initiative is described elsewhere (un-
published data).14
Estimating the Deficit in Neurosurgical Care
The unmet need, or deficit in neurosurgical care, repre-
sents the difference between the total estimated number of 
essential neurosurgical conditions presenting for treatment 
and the current number of neurosurgical cases that can be 
performed given the existing workforce. The number of 
essential neurosurgical conditions was calculated by tak-
ing the product of neurosurgical volume (from each meta-
analysis by disease entity3,7–9,11,16,19) and surgical proportion 
(from the provider survey5). The number of neurosurgical 
cases that can be currently performed, on the other hand, 
was obtained by taking the product of the number of neu-
rosurgeons (from the Workforce estimate [unpublished 
data]) and the median number of cases performed (from 
the provider survey estimate5). The deficit was then cal-
culated on a regional and income-group basis to provide 
a more granular description of need and volume, and to 
highlight disparity in neurosurgical care across regions. 
Then, a country-specific ratio of neurosurgeons to essen-
tial neurosurgical cases (both surgical and consultative) 
was estimated. The total number of cases within a region 
was allocated to each country according to the population 
proportion of a given country within its WHO region and 
World Bank income group. For the worldwide estimate, 
all countries with available workforce data were included, 
irrespective of WHO or World Bank classification. Incor-
porating the country-specific neurosurgeon figure from 
the workforce survey, maps were then created to depict 
this ratio using Tableau software.
Results
Estimations of the volume of each disease, the propor-
tion requiring neurosurgical intervention, and the quanti-
fication of the existing neurosurgical workforce have been 
described in detail elsewhere. Here, we have aggregated 
this information and synthesized the findings into a di-
gestible summary.
Neurosurgical Cases by Region and Income Group
An estimated 13.8 million essential neurosurgical cas-
es develop each year, of which more than 80% arise in 
low- and middle-income countries (Table 1). A detailed 
breakdown of neurosurgical volume by disease can be 
found in the Appendix (Tables S1–S23). Corresponding 
to the regional population proportions, an expected 3.5 
million and 3.7 million new cases are expected in South-
east Asia and the Western Pacific, respectively. Africa is 
expected to endure nearly 2 million neurosurgical cases, 
in contrast to about 665,000 cases in the US and Canada. 
Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean, and Latin America 
each will encounter between 1.1 and 1.8 million new neu-
rosurgical cases annually (Table 1). Among the conditions 
we have defined as requiring essential neurosurgical care, 
surgery for TBI (burr holes, craniotomy/craniectomy, etc.) 
accounts for 45%, cerebrovascular accident for 20%, hy-
drocephalus for 7%, and brain tumors for 5%. Vascular 
anomalies (2.2%), neural tube defects (0.3%), and spinal 
tumors (0.1%) occupy a relatively modest proportion of the 
global neurosurgical need.
The number of cases requiring neurosurgical consul-
tation—but not necessarily surgical intervention—is far 
greater, approaching 22.6 million annually (Table 2). 
Again, Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific bear the 
greatest consultative demand with 5.8 million and 6.2 mil-
lion cases each year, respectively. Low and middle-income 
countries (LMIC) endure the greatest burden at 17.6 mil-
lion cases, compared with 4.3 million cases in high-in-
come countries (HIC).
Neurosurgeons by Region and Income Group
We identified 49,940 practicing neurosurgeons world-
wide (unpublished data). Ninety-eight percent (98.9%) of 
neurosurgeons were identified via the WFNS-sponsored 
electronic survey, while 560 neurosurgeons (1.1%) from 
34 countries (14.9%) in which no data were available were 
imputed via statistical modeling. The greatest population 
of neurosurgeons resides in the Western Pacific region, 
with China and Japan alone accounting for more than 
18,000 neurosurgeons. Europe and the US/Canada have 
the next largest populations of neurosurgeons, with 10,719 
and 5296 neurosurgeons, respectively. In the African re-
gion, with a population of 990 million, 488 neurosurgeons 
were identified (Table 3). Forty-four percent (44%) of neu-
rosurgeons worldwide reside in high-income countries.
Previously, we have identified the mean neurosurgical 
volume reasonably managed by a neurosurgeon in a given 
country as 223 cases per year.5 This assumes a surgeon’s 
perceived workload is maintained at a level of 75 out of 
100 (where 0 is “not at all busy” and 100 is “extremely 
busy, overworked”). The greatest total neurosurgical ca-

pacity exists in the Western Pacific region, where more 
than 22,000 neurosurgeons are capable of performing 
nearly 5 million essential neurosurgical cases annually. In 
contrast, the nearly 500 neurosurgeons in Africa can be 
expected to perform approximately 110,000 neurosurgical 
operations. Worldwide, and ignoring geographic boundar-
ies and uneven case distribution, the overall surgical ca-
pacity is approximately 11 million essential neurosurgical 
cases per year (Table 3).
The Deficit in Neurosurgical Care
The current deficit in neurosurgical care is approxi-
mately 5.2 million (Table 3). This deficit derives from 
the difference between the number of essential cases en-
countered annually and the essential surgical capacity, 
where essential surgical capacity excludes nonessential 
cases performed by neurosurgeons, particularly in HIC. 
To meet this demand, an estimated additional 22,626 
neurosurgeons would need to be trained. The greatest 
deficit resides in Southeast Asia where nearly 2.5 million 
essential cases go unmet. The tremendous shortage of 
neurosurgeons in India—where 3500 neurosurgeons are 
responsible for a population of more than 1.2 billion—is 
largely responsible for this health care discrepancy. For 
the entire region, 2.5-times the existing number of sur-
geons are needed to provide appropriate coverage. In Af-
rica, where more than 1.8 million cases are not being ad-
dressed by capable neurosurgeons, the surgical workforce 
must increase by more than 1700% to meet the regional 
demand. The vast majority of the population in Africa has 
no access to a neurosurgeon, independent of other geo-
graphic, social, or financial barriers that may exist.14 In 
terms of essential care, three WHO regions—the region 
of the Americas restricted to the US and Canada only, the 
European region, and the Western Pacific region—do not 
demonstrate a workforce deficit, although the need for ad-
ditional neurosurgeons in these regions to meet neurologi-
cal conditions not accounted for in our analysis remains a 
salient consideration.
Discussion
In this summary, for neurosurgical diseases, we es-
timate approximately 13.8 million new operative cases 
and 22.6 million new consultative cases exist worldwide 
each year. TBI and stroke-related conditions and sequelae 
constitute approximately 60% of essential neurosurgi-
cal volume, with tumors, hydrocephalus, epilepsy, and 
infectious-related conditions accounting for the majority 
of the remaining proportion of disease. A tremendous dis-
parity exists in the global workforce; 82% of neurosurgi-
cal volume exists in LMICs where approximately 56% of 
neurosurgeons reside. While Africa accounts for 15% of 
the global volume of neurosurgical disease, African hos-
pitals and health care networks have access to less than 
1% of the neurosurgeon community. An estimated 23,300 
additional surgeons—approximately 11,300 in Southeast 
Asia, and 8400 in Africa—are needed in low- and middle-
income countries to adequately address essential neuro-
surgical disease worldwide. For the first time, an estimate 
of the deficit of neurosurgical care is provided. The world 
maps (Figs. 1 and 2) offer a pictorial representation of the 
volume of essential neurosurgical disease observed by 
the existing neurosurgical workforce in a given country; 
disparity in care is illustrated. Training capable and com-
petent neurosurgeons is a fundamental step in establish-
ing equal access to safe and timely neurosurgical care. A 
benchmark is thus established for which to aim.
Examining Tables 1 and 2 more closely, there are 3 im-
portant observations that merit specific discussion. First, 
these disease figures are estimates. While they derive from 
the best available evidence and are computed using modern 
statistical modeling, they remain susceptible to the same 
methodological assumptions made for any epidemiologi-
cal estimation of disease incidence. Second, we notice that 
diseases requiring advanced diagnostic equipment for di-
agnosis (e.g., MRI) are more likely to be underrepresented 
in regions made up of predominantly low income or lower 
middle income countries. CNS tumors are taken as an ex-
ample. There exists a positive correlation between age and 
incidence of brain tumors. Most populations in HICs ex-
hibit a greater median survival than those in LMICs. Thus, 
ignoring competing variables (such as carcinogenic expo-
sures, or prevention of metastatic spread) finding a higher 
proportion of brain tumors in the US/Canadian region 
than in African region follows logic. However, the degree 
to which this difference exists suggests additional factors 
are involved. For these less clinically overt diseases, a di-
agnosis bias almost certainly affects these results. Brain 
and spinal tumors in low-resource settings are not being

* “Case Deficit” and “Additional Surgeons Necessary” are left blank for regions that have a capacity surplus. Capacity surplus suggests cases are being performed by 
neurosurgeons that fall outside of the definition of “essential neurosurgical care,” such as degenerative spine disease and movement disorders.

diagnosed due to lack of equipment and/or lack of access 
to the level of care requisite for their diagnosis. Converse-
ly, readily diagnosed diseases such as neural tube defects 
are more likely to be captured by population-based epide-
miological studies, regardless of diagnostic infrastructure. 
Third, while the estimates are staggering—especially in 
relation to the existing workforce—they are most certainly 
an underestimate of the true surgical responsibilities faced 
by the global neurosurgery community. Absent from these 
estimates are entities such as diagnostic procedures (lum-
bar punctures, ventricular taps, etc.), repeat or redo surger-
ies, and, importantly, the great proportion of neurosurgical 
interventions that are deemed “nonessential” by the out-
lined criteria.
This year, nearly 5.2 million essential neurosurgical cas-
es are estimated to go unmet by a qualified neurosurgeon, 
resulting in otherwise avoidable disability and death. Such 
essential neurosurgical cases include relatively straightfor-
ward procedures such as burr hole craniotomy for hema-
toma evacuation and shunt insertion for childhood hydro-
cephalus. Interestingly, these are the only two surgeries 
mentioned in the 44 essential surgical procedures listed 
within the Disease Control Priorities series published by 
the World Bank Group.4 However, extraaxial hemorrhage 
and hydrocephalus represent only a small fraction of neu-
rosurgical conditions that result in severe disability and 
death if left untreated. Essential operations as outlined in 
this report also include brain tumor resection, cerebral an-
eurysm exclusion, and open spinal fracture reduction and 
fixation, all considered to require more advanced surgi-
cal technique and resources. Designating treatment tiers to 
balance access to care and quality of delivery is imperative 
to optimize geographic coverage. While a discussion of 
this concept reaches beyond the scope of this summary, 
the centralization of highly complex neurosurgical care—
while also prioritizing basic, emergency neurosurgical 
care peripherally—is an important model that must remain 
a priority for the global neurosurgery community, espe-
cially in LMICs.
Ongoing Efforts to Increase Neurosurgical Capacity
A number of efforts to increase neurosurgical capac-
ity in LMICs have already begun to make a difference. 
Enabling nonneurosurgeons to perform neurosurgical in-
terventions (task-shifting) that are technically straightfor-
ward and have a high benefit to risk ratio (such as emer-
gency evacuation of an epidural hematoma) is rational. 
Likewise, teaching nonneurosurgeons to place shunts for 
hydrocephalus has been advocated by some, but infant hy-
drocephalus is not immediately life-threatening; although 
placing the initial shunt is not difficult, the significant 
complication rate requires timely neurosurgical expertise 
for subsequent management. The ultimate goal should be

to increase neurosurgical capacity by increasing the num-
ber of competent and accessible neurosurgeons in under-
served regions. The most sustainable way to achieve this 
will be for adequately trained national neurosurgeons to 
begin training programs in their home countries. This may 
initially require the importation of expertise, but the need 
for this would diminish over time if an investment is made 
in training individuals from these countries.
The global neurosurgery community should prioritize 
the provision of training to individuals from countries that 
do not have adequate neurosurgery residency programs. 
Historically, people who leave home to train in a high-in-
come country often fail to return. But in the past decade, 
sub-Saharan Africa has benefitted from an influx of neu-
rosurgeons because the few established training programs 
on the continent have embraced the opportunity to incor-
porate trainees from the less developed countries into their 
residency programs. Programs in Morocco, Senegal, Zim-
babwe, and South Africa have trained approximately 60 
new neurosurgeons from other African countries thus far. 
Also, a new East African training program has recently 
been established in cooperation with The College of Sur-
geons of East Central and Southern Africa, with training 
sites in Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya. All these programs 
provide more appropriately contextualized training in re-
gard to pathology and resource availability, and are more 
likely to see their trainees return home to build neurosurgi-
cal capacity in their own countries. In addition, longitudi-
nal partnerships between centers in LMICs and academic 
neurosurgery departments in HICs (Duke University, Uni-
versity of Alabama, University of Miami, The University 
of Toronto, The Weill Cornell Medical College, The Bar-
row Neurological Institute, and others) are fostering con-
tinued training, mentoring, and collaborative research in 
sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. 
Other programs, such as CURE Hydrocephalus and Spina 
Bifida, provide subspecialty training fellowships to neuro-
surgeons from across the developing world. Furthermore, 
organized neurosurgery (such as the Foundation for Inter-
national Education in Neurosurgery, the WFNS, the Asian 
Australasian Society of Neurological Surgeons, the Amer-
ican Association of Neurological Surgeons, the European 
Society of Pediatric Neurosurgery, and the International 
Society of Pediatric Neurosurgery) has long been engaged 
in international neurosurgery education. The past 10 years 
have seen a noticeable escalation in awareness of and com-
mitment to global neurosurgery that should, if we stay on 
mission, gradually improve access to neurosurgical care 
for people everywhere.
The Way Forward
The Role of Professional/National Societies
National neurosurgical societies exist to represent their

community of neurosurgeons via surgical education, the 
promotion of scientific exchange, establishment of prac-
tice guidelines, and at times the promotion of a legislative 
agenda. For an individual surgeon, particularly one who 
operates in a solo practice, the national society serves as 
the most direct conduit to peer evaluation and feedback, 
continuing surgical education, and surgeon fellowship. A 
robust and active professional society serves to enhance 
the quality of neurosurgical care delivery by its member-
ship. Thus, as the global neurosurgery effort matures, pro-
fessional societies are a natural springboard from which 
to launch targeted intervention strategies, and may have 
broader impact than simply targeting a specific hospital, 
university, or institution.
Naturally, a professional society’s role depends upon 
the resources and capabilities that exist on the ground. For 
example, in low-resource settings, high-priority initiatives 
of a neurosurgical society may include surveying region-
al disease burden, organizing available manpower, and 
lobbying for federal support. Meanwhile, societies in re-
source-rich countries can invite meaningful participation 
from LMIC surgeons, organize a workforce of members 
interested in cross-national education and training, and 
allocate activities, meetings, and funding to international 
education and research initiatives. Indeed, some societies 
in HICs are already playing an active role by doing just 
this. Throughout, developing and fostering a relationship 
between societies built upon respect and mutual benefit 
is essential to ensuring productive and sustainable cross-
collaborations.
The Role of Global Governance
The WFNS is a professional, nongovernmental organi-
zation representing 118 individual societies of neurosur-
gery worldwide. With the overarching purpose to promote 
global improvement in neurosurgical care, capacity build-
ing through education and surgeon training is among the 
defining principles of the Federation. For example, as the 
glaring shortage of neurosurgeons in Africa has grown, 
the WFNS has taken specific actions such as facilitation 
of the “Africa 100” initiative championed by Professor 
Majid Samii and designed to increase the number of per-
manent practicing surgeons on the continent. Via such ini-
tiatives, the Federation can work to establish educational 
paradigms that incorporate open-access, web-based edu-
cational platforms accessible to trainees and consultants 
from all corners of the globe. Indeed, the WFNS already 
has a track record as a central, nonpartisan organization 
for open collaboration between member partners and the 
transfer of ideas and technologies across the many na-
tional societies. Moving forward, the WFNS is optimally 
suited for advocacy toward and coordination of the neu-
rosurgery capacity building effort. In so doing, the Fed-
eration is well positioned to: 1) raise awareness of the un-
met neurosurgical care as a global public health issue; 2) 
develop educational and practice guidelines based upon 
member input; 3) collect and monitor global neurosurgical 
workforce and capacity data; and 4) facilitate coordination 
and collaboration between the academic community and 
state-sponsored agencies toward efficiently addressing the 
worldwide deficit in neurosurgical care.
Integrating Neurosurgery Within the Overall Surgical Community
Neurosurgical efforts aimed at LMICs would ben-
efit greatly from integration with ongoing global surgical 
programs through partnerships with professional societ-
ies, academia, and nongovernmental organizations, to 
avoid duplication and to complement the surgical sys-
tem–strengthening efforts of each stakeholder. In many 
regions, there already exist efforts designed to develop or 
improve surgical and anesthesia service delivery, enhanc-
ing the overall surgical ecosystem. Consider, for example, 
the essential nature of a blood bank for safe surgical care: 
it matters little if packed red blood cells are used for a 
postpartum hemorrhage, a malaria crisis, or a severe TBI. 
Surgeons of all types and anesthetists can work together 
synergistically to develop and maintain components of the 
entire surgical delivery system. Partnership with United 
Nations bodies, such as the WHO, provide collaborative 
arrangements with local governments that offer the ad-
vantage of enhancing service delivery mechanisms in-
country. The WHO, through the Emergency and Essential 
Surgical Care Program, is poised to facilitate global coor-
dination of neurosurgical efforts along with other surgical 
stakeholders as defined by the mandates of member states.
Currently, combined efforts targeting advocacy, ser-
vice delivery, data collection, essential medicines, and 
health workforce are critical, thus fulfilling the mandates 
of World Health Assembly Resolution 68.15 (2015) on 
strengthening emergency and essential surgical care and 
anesthesia as a component of universal health coverage,7 
all with direct links to the sustainable development goals.18
Strengths and Limitations of the Study
The estimates and conclusions outlined in this sum-
mary must be considered in the context of several limi-
tations. First, most disease volume figures derive from 
large systematic reviews and meta-analyses, as reliable, 
population-based estimates for each country or region 
are nonexistent. Similarly, the surgical workforce figures 
relied upon accurate neurosurgical association reporting, 
and at times questionnaire responses and statistical mod-
eling, all of which carry bias and intrinsic inconsistencies. 
Throughout the tables and text, we assume that neurosur-
geons are optimally distributed geographically in relation 
to the at-risk population. We also assume that each trained 
neurosurgeon is capable of safely treating each condition 
encompassed within the designation of essential neurosur-
gical care. While these assumptions are generally safe for 
epidemiological modeling at the region- or country-level, 
they would not permit accurate allocation of resources at 
the city or hospital level. In relation to surgical capacity, 
we have focused on the surgeon only—not the wealth of 
infrastructure, equipment, and personnel required along-
side the surgeon to facilitate safe and timely provision of 
neurosurgical care. We acknowledge the tremendous im-
portance of these resources, and we are actively conduct-
ing a worldwide survey to better understand their acces-
sibility to current and future surgeons.14
In an effort to prioritize the most life-threatening neu-
rosurgical conditions worldwide, we have deliberately ex-
cluded many important conditions commonly addressed 
by neurosurgeons, most notably degenerative spine dis-

ease. This relative limitation warrants specific elabora-
tion. In the US, with more than 5000 neurosurgeons, we 
estimate the case capacity is nearly 1.2 million cases/year. 
Meanwhile, the volume of essential neurosurgical cases is 
estimated at only 576,000, suggesting a surplus of neuro-
surgeons exists in the US. We would caution the reader 
against this conclusion. The majority of neurosurgical cas-
es performed in the US are for conditions falling outside 
the designation used in this report of essential neurosurgi-
cal care. Indeed, entities like degenerative spine disease, 
chronic pain, movement disorders, and many other con-
ditions are well known to cause disability and suffering 
if left untreated. Thus, a shortage of neurosurgeons may 
exist even in the most developed of countries, depending 
upon the level and type of neurosurgical care demanded 
by a given population. The scope and purpose of this pa-
per is to offer a description of the workforce capacity and 
deficit that exists for essential neurosurgical care, a des-
ignation that itself aims to prioritize those patients who 
are most likely to benefit from lifesaving and disability-
averting neurosurgical care.
Finally, this report ignores the concept of task sharing 
and the number of procedures potentially performed by 
nonneurosurgeon providers. Training general surgeons 
in common neurosurgical procedures such as ventriculo-
peritoneal shunt insertion and burr hole craniotomy is a 
practical strategy that might more quickly help curb the 
overwhelming neurosurgical burden. Reasonable neuro-
surgical experts will disagree on the ethics and quality-
related implications of this frequently used strategy in the 
realm of global health. The potential capacity-related con-
sequences of this strategy, however, are absent from the 
figures provided above.
While inherent limitations exist for an epidemiological 
survey and capacity estimation of this scope, careful and 
deliberate measures were taken to ensure data validity and 
provide methodological transparency throughout. Rather 
than relying on surgical log data from hospitals and health 
systems where the surgical care is known to be inadequate, 
we approached surgical deficit figures first from the disease 
component of the equation. Though data modeling was 
necessary in some cases, the disease-specific estimates 
represent the best available evidence to date, derived from 
among the most comprehensive systematic reviews avail-
able in the neurosurgical literature. Additionally, surgical 
provider data arose from the most far-reaching effort yet to 
quantify the worldwide population of neurosurgeons, and 
involved a partnering effort with many active international 
neurosurgery initiatives such as the WFNS.
Conclusions
Each year, 13.8 million new essential neurosurgical 
operative cases and 22.6 million new consultative cases 
present worldwide. TBI, tumor, hydrocephalus, and stroke-
related conditions constitute the majority of essential neu-
rosurgical volume globally. Regional variation in disease 
incidence is likely influenced by a host of factors including 
baseline population demographics, risk factor exposure, 
and genetic susceptibility. Wide workforce gaps exist, 
and the uneven distribution of neurosurgeons to disease 
volume creates large geographic pockets of surgical ac-
cess shortage. Nearly 23,000 additional neurosurgeons are 
needed in low- and middle-income countries to adequately 
address the unmet deficit of more than 5 million neurosur-
gical operations worldwide.
