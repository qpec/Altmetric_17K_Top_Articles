IMPORTANCE Recent evidence indicates a high prevalence of child abuse exposure in modern
US veterans, which may explain in part their higher likelihood of suicide relative to civilians.
However, the relationship between child abuse exposure and suicide-related outcomes in
military personnel relative to civilians is unknown. Furthermore, the associations among
deployment-related trauma, child abuse exposure, and suicide-related outcomes in military
personnel have not been examined.
OBJECTIVES To determine whether child abuse exposure is more prevalent in Canadian
Armed Forces (CAF) personnel compared with the Canadian general population (CGP); to
compare the association between child abuse exposure and suicidal ideation, suicide plans,
and suicide attempts among the CAF and CGP; and to determine whether child abuse
exposure has an additive or interaction effect on the association of deployment-related
trauma and past-year suicidal ideation and suicide plans among Regular Forces personnel.
DATA, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data were collected from the following 2 nationally
representative data sets: the 2013 Canadian Forces Mental Health Survey (CFMHS) for the CAF
(8161 respondents; response rate, 79.8%) and the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey–
Mental Health (CCHS-MH) for the CGP (23 395 respondents; response rate, 68.9% [of these,
15 981 age-matched participants were drawn]). Data were collected from April 15 to August 31,
2013, for the CFMHS and January 2 to December 31, 2012, for the CCHS-MH. Data were analyzed
from October 2014 to October 22, 2015. Statistical weights were applied to both data sets.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Child abuse exposure, including physical abuse, sexual
abuse, and exposure to intimate partner violence, and deployment-related trauma were
assessed in relation to suicide-related outcomes.
RESULTS Data were analyzed from 24 142 respondents aged 18 to 60 years (Regular Forces,
86.1% male and 13.9% female; Reserve Forces, 90.6% male and 8.9% female; and CGP,
49.9% male and 50.1% female). Any child abuse exposure was higher in the Regular Forces
(47.7%; 95% CI, 46.4%-49.1%) and Afghanistan mission–deployed Reserve Forces (49.4%;
95% CI, 46.3%-51.5%) compared with the CGP (33.1%; 95% CI, 31.8%-34.4%). All types of
child abuse exposures were associated with increased odds of suicidal ideation, suicide plans,
and suicide attempts in the CGP (range of adjusted odds ratios [AORs], 3.0 [95% CI, 2.3-3.9]
to 7.7 [95% CI, 5.7-10.3]; P < .05) and CAF (range of AORs, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.0-2.9] to 6.3 [95% CI,
4.2-9.5]; P < .05), with many associations significantly weaker in military personnel relative to
civilians. Additive effects for past-year suicide ideation (AOR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.8-4.2) and
past-year suicide plans (AOR, 4.6; 95% CI, 2.3-9.2) but not interactive effects for past-year
suicide ideation (AOR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.7-2.2) and past-year suicide plans (AOR, 0.8; 95% CI,
0.3-2.2) were noted between deployment-related trauma and child abuse exposure among
Regular Forces personnel.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Individuals with a child abuse history may be more likely to
enter the military, and child abuse exposure may increase the likelihood of suicide-related
outcomes. Prevention efforts targeting child abuse may reduce suicide-related outcomes.

S
uicide is an important public health problem in mili-
tary and civilian populations. In 2002, in a representa-
tive Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) sample, approxi-
mately 4% of serving personnel reported past-year suicidal
ideation.1,2 In 2013, the past-year and lifetime prevalences of
suicidal ideation were 4.3% and 15.4%, respectively, in the CAF
and 3.6% and 13.3%, respectively, in the Canadian general
population (CGP) (J.S., T.O.A., T.T., et al, unpublished data, Au-
gust 2015). Recent data from the United States indicates that
the lifetime prevalences of suicidal ideation, suicide plans, and
suicide attempts among soldiers were 13.9%, 5.3%, and 2.4%,
respectively.3 Despite a large volume of literature about sui-
cide,accuratelyanticipatingwhichindividualwillthinkabout,
plan, and attempt suicide remains a difficult task in military
and civilian populations.
Traumatic experiences may occur during military service,
deployment in peacekeeping missions,4 and combat.1 Many
studies have examined occupational trauma as an explanation
forsuicideamongmilitarypersonnel.Forexample,deployment-
relatedtrauma,suchaswitnessingatrocitiesormassacres,isas-
sociated with increased odds of experiencing past-year sui-
cidal ideation among military personnel.1 However, increased
suicides have been noted among military personnel who have
not deployed,5 showing that deployment-related trauma does
not completely explain the occurrence of suicide among this
population.Otherstudies6-8foundthatdeploymentwasnotre-
latedtosuiciderisk.Militaryandveteransuicidepreventionef-
forts thus hinge on understanding what factors other than de-
ployment drive suicide.
Inadditiontooccupationaltrauma,militarypersonnelmay
also experience nonoccupational trauma. Child abuse expo-
sure has been linked to suicidal ideation and suicide at-
tempts mainly in civilian populations.9-14 In representative Ca-
nadian and US general population samples, an increasing
number of childhood adversities corresponds with a step-
wise increase in the odds of suicidal ideation and suicide
attempts.10,15 Trauma occurring in childhood before military
service may be cumulative with deployment-related trauma,
meaningthatanincreasednumberoflifetimetraumaticevents
may be associated with a greater likelihood of suicidal ide-
ation and suicide attempts. Alternatively, low exposure to
trauma may result in development of resilience for some, with
anincreasedabilitytomanagenewtrauma.16Theeffectofchild
abuse exposure and deployment-related trauma on the like-
lihood of suicide-related outcomes among military person-
nel remains unknown.
Fromclinicalandnonrepresentativemilitarysamples,child
abuse exposure is known to be highly prevalent among mili-
tary personnel, ranging from 17% to 50%.17-19 In a represen-
tative 2002 CAF sample, 1% to 15% of respondents reported
being badly beaten, witnessing their mother being beaten,
and/orbeingsexuallyabusedinchildhood.20Inaddition,being
badly beaten as a child and witnessing severe fighting in the
home were associated with an increased odds of suicide
attempts.21Althoughinformative,thesestudiesarelimitedow-
ing to subjective assessment of child abuse (ie, how were badly
beatenorseverefightinginthehomeinterpreted?),andtheypre-
date the mission in Afghanistan. Recent US studies have ex-
amined predictors and correlates of suicide among soldiers,
but none of these studies has investigated the potential role
that child abuse exposure may play in suicide-related
outcomes.3,5,22-25
Inquiryintomilitarysampleswouldbenovelbecausesome
evidence indicates that individuals who experience child-
hood adversity may be more likely to select themselves into
the military, possibly to escape adversity at home.26,27 How-
ever, this statement has been criticized because it perpetu-
ates the stereotype of the disadvantaged background of mili-
tary personnel.28 In addition, no representative military and
civilian comparisons from any country examine possible dif-
ferences in the prevalence of child abuse exposure and poten-
tial differences of effect size in the relationship between child
abuse exposure and suicide-related outcomes. For example,
differencesbetweenthemilitaryandcivilianmentalhealthsys-
tems might facilitate or inhibit help seeking by those with child
abuse exposure, thereby decreasing or increasing the risk for
eventual deterioration into suicidal behavior.29 Comparing
these populations would provide a unique opportunity to situ-
ate military suicide–related outcomes in a larger context.
We undertook the present study with 3 overall objec-
tives. First, we sought to determine whether child abuse ex-
posure is more prevalent in the CAF compared with the CGP.
Second, we compared the strength of the association be-
tween child abuse exposure and suicide-related behavior
amongtheCAFandtheCGP.Third,weexaminedwhetherchild
abuse exposure has an additive or interaction effect on the as-
sociation between deployment-related trauma and suicide-
related outcomes among Regular Forces personnel.
Methods
Data and Sample
Data were drawn from 2 Canadian data sets. The Canadian
Forces Mental Health Survey (CFMHS) was collected in 2013
Key Points
Question: What is the association between child abuse exposure
and suicidal ideation, suicide plans, and suicide attempts in a
representative military sample compared with a representative
general population sample, and what interplay exists between
child abuse exposure and deployment-related trauma among
Regular Forces personnel?
Findings: Child abuse exposure was more prevalent among
Regular Forces personnel (47.7%) and Reserve Forces personnel
(49.4%) compared with the Canadian general population (33.1%)
and was associated with an increased likelihood of suicidal ideation,
suicide plans, and suicide attempts in all study populations, with
associations significantly weaker for many outcomes in military
personnel relative to civilians. Deployment-related trauma was
associated with past-year suicidal ideation and suicide plans, but
compared with deployment-related trauma, child abuse exposure
had a more robust association with suicide-related outcomes.
Meaning: Individuals with a history of child abuse exposure may
be more likely to enter the military, and child abuse exposure may
increase the likelihood of suicide-related outcomes.

(8161 respondents; response rate, 79.8%),30 and the Cana-
dianCommunityHealthSurvey–MentalHealth(CCHS-MH)was
collected in 2012 (23 395 respondents; response rate, 68.9%).31
Both data sets are cross-sectional and nationally representa-
tive and were collected by Statistics Canada using the same
training and quality control procedures, face-to-face inter-
view technology, and survey methods and assessments.30,31
Anonymity of all respondents was protected by Canada’
s Sta-
tistic Act,32,33 which may be especially important among mili-
tary personnel.34 The CFMHS sample was representative of the
Regular Forces personnel (n = 6692), approximately 46% of
whom had deployed in support of the mission in Afghani-
stan, and Reserve Forces personnel (n = 1469) who deployed
in support of the mission in Afghanistan. Reservists who had
not deployed in support of the mission in Afghanistan were
not included in the survey. For accurate comparison, the
CCHS-MH sample was restricted to respondents aged 18 to 60
years (n = 15 981) to match the age in the CFMHS. Both sur-
veys were voluntary, and the privacy and confidentiality of the
respondentsareensuredundertheStatisticsAct.35,36Datawere
collected from April 15 to August 31, 2013, for the CFMHS and
January 2 to December 31, 2012, for the CCHS-MH. Ethical ap-
proval for both surveys was provided by the relevance policy
committees at Statistics Canada. Respondents provided writ-
ten informed consent.
Measurement
Child Abuse Exposure
Physical abuse and exposure to intimate partner violence were
assessed using items from the Childhood Experiences of Vio-
lence Questionnaire.37 Respondents 18 years or older were
asked about childhood abuse that occurred before their 16th
birthday.Binaryclassificationsofchildabuseexposure(present
or absent) were made according to the Childhood Experi-
ences of Violence Questionnaire guidelines as follows: physi-
cal abuse was defined as present if 1 or more of 3 variables met
the following threshold criteria: (1) being slapped on the face,
head, or ears or hit or spanked with something hard 3 or more
times; (2) being pushed, grabbed, shoved, or having some-
thing thrown at the respondent to hurt them 3 or more times;
and (3) being kicked, bit, punched, choked, burned, or physi-
cally attacked 1 or more times. Exposure to intimate partner
violence was defined as present if the respondent indicated
having seen or heard parents, stepparents, or guardians hit-
ting each other or another adult in the home 3 or more times.37
Sexual abuse was assessed using 2 items and categorized as
present if either of the following occurred 1 or more times:
(1) attempted or being forced into unwanted sexual activity by
being threatened, held down, or hurt in some way and/or
(2) sexual touching, meaning unwanted touching or grab-
bing, kissing, or fondling against the respondent’
s will. Any
child abuse exposure included physical abuse, sexual abuse,
and/or exposure to intimate partner violence.
Deployment-Related Traumatic Events
Deployment-relatedtraumaticeventswereassessedonlyinthe
CFMHS data and included (1) knowing someone who was se-
riously injured or killed; (2) finding yourself in a threatening
situation and unable to respond because of rules of engage-
ment;(3)everbeinginjured;(4)everseeingillorinjuredwomen
or children whom the respondent was unable to help; (5) ever
feeling responsible for the death of Canadian or allied person-
nel; and (6) ever having a close call, for example, being shot
or hit but saved by protective gear. Personnel indicating that
they had never been deployed were coded as no to all of these
experiences. A variable was computed to assess whether any
deployment-relatedtraumaticeventhadbeenexperienced(yes
or no). The eMethods in the Supplement provides additional
deployment-related traumatic events.
Military Rank and Sociodemographic Information
Military rank in CAF personnel included junior noncommis-
sioned member, senior noncommissioned member, and offi-
cer. Sociodemographic covariates included age, sex, educa-
tional level, household income, and marital status.
Suicide-Related Outcomes
Eachrespondentwasaskedwhetherheorshehadeverthought
seriously about committing suicide or taking his or her own
life (yes or no) and whether this experience had happened in
the past year (yes or no). Each respondent was asked whether
he or she had ever made a plan to commit suicide (yes or no)
and whether this experience had occurred in the past year (yes
or no). Each respondent was asked whether he or she had ever
attempted suicide or tried to take his or her own life (yes or
no). Past-year suicide attempts were not included owing to low
occurrence.
Statistical Analysis
DatawereanalyzedfromOctober2014toOctober22,2015.Sta-
tistical weights were applied for population representation in
the CGP, Regular Forces, and Reserve Forces. We performed
bootstrapping to account for the complex survey design. First,
descriptive statistics for each population were computed. Sec-
ond, overall and sex-specific prevalence estimates were com-
puted for child abuse exposure across the study populations.
Third, a series of multivariable logistic regression analyses
adjusted for sociodemographic covariates were conducted to
determine the likelihood of child abuse exposure among Regu-
lar Forces compared with the CGP, Afghanistan mission–
deployed Reserve Forces compared with the CGP, and Regu-
lar Forces compared with Afghanistan mission–deployed
Reserve Forces. Ad hoc analyses were conducted for the sexual
abuse models, which demonstrated that limited variability
across income created unstable results. Therefore, the sexual
abuse models were further stratified by income level of less
than $80 000 and $80 000 or more (US $58 593).
Fourth, a series of multivariable logistic regression mod-
els (ie, adjusted for sociodemographic covariates) was com-
puted to determine whether child abuse exposure increased
the likelihood of suicide-related outcomes in each popula-
tion (findings examining all child abuse exposure types con-
currently are provided in eTable 1 in the Supplement). Differ-
ences across study populations were examined using an
interaction term for child abuse exposure by study popula-
tion. We calculated population-attributable fractions (PAFs),

which represent an estimate of the proportion of the suicide-
related outcome that might be decreased if the child abuse ex-
posure had not occurred.38 The PAFs provide informative es-
timates of the magnitude of the associations, although the
causality assumption is not met with these data.
Fifth, the additive effects of child abuse exposure and de-
ployment-related trauma on past-year suicide-related out-
comes among Regular Forces personnel were examined using
multivariable logistic regression analyses (ie, adjusted for so-
ciodemographiccovariatesandmilitaryrank).Finally,wecom-
puted a series of main effects and interaction effects logistic
regression models (ie, adjusted for sociodemographic covar-
iates and military rank) to examine whether child abuse ex-
posure and deployment-related trauma had an interactive ef-
fect on past-year suicide-related outcomes among Regular
Forces personnel. Additional deployment-related trauma
analyses are provided in eTable 2 in the Supplement.
Results
Table 1 provides sociodemographic information. The preva-
lence of any child abuse exposure was 33.1% (95% CI, 31.8%-
34.4%) in the CGP, 47.7% (95% CI, 46.4%-49.1%) in the Regu-
lar Forces, and 49.4% (95% CI, 46.3%-51.5%) in the Reserve
Forces (Table 2). Prevalence of child abuse exposure in the CGP
was slightly different compared with prevalence reported in
a 2014 publication (33.1% vs 32.1%)15 because the present in-
vestigation was restricted to respondents aged 18 to 60 years
to match the military personnel sample. Regular Forces per-
sonnel were more likely than the CGP to have experienced all
types of child abuse exposure (range of adjusted odds ratios
[AORs], 1.6 [95% CI, 1.4-1.9] to 2.8 [95% CI, 2.1-3.5]; P < .001),
with the exception of sexual abuse among males. Reserve
Forces personnel were more likely than the CGP to have ex-
perienced any physical abuse and exposure to intimate part-
ner violence (with the exception of females for the exposure
tointimatepartnerviolenceonly);sexualabusewasmorelikely
in the Reserve Forces compared with the CGP among females
in the higher income category only. All types of child abuse ex-
posure were equally likely among Regular Forces and Re-
serve Forces personnel.
All child abuse exposure types were associated with in-
creased odds of suicidal ideation, suicide plans, and suicide
attempts in the CGP (range of AORs, 3.0 [95% CI, 2.3-3.9] to
7.7 [95% CI, 5.7-10.3]; P < .05) and CAF (range of AORs, 1.7 [95%
CI, 1.0-2.9] to 6.3 [95% CI, 4.2-9.5]; P < .05), with a few excep-
tions among the Reserve Forces personnel likely owing to un-
derpowered models (Table 3 and Table 4). When we com-
pared the populations (using interaction terms), the
associations between child abuse exposure and many suicide-
related outcomes were significantly weaker for many out-
comes in the CAF relative to the CGP (Tables 3 and 4). The PAF
estimates indicate that child abuse exposure is associated with
a substantial proportion of suicide-related outcomes, includ-
ing 14.9% to 62.6% in the CGP, 10.1% to 47.0% in the Regular
Forces personnel, and 10.2% to 52.4% among Reserve Forces
personnel.

Among Regular Forces personnel, 43.8% had experi-
enced 1 or more deployment-related trauma. Deployment-
related trauma occurring without a history of child abuse ex-
posure was not associated with past-year suicidal ideation
(AOR, 1.2 [95% CI, 0.7-1.8]) or suicide plans (AOR, 1.9 [95% CI,

trauma and child abuse exposure and deployment-related
trauma together were associated with increased odds of past-

c Models comparing the CAF and CGP samples and models comparing the
Regular Forces and Reserve Forces were adjusted for sex, age, marital status,

dThe CGP constituted the reference category with an AOR of 1.
e The Canadian Reserve Forces constituted the reference category with an AOR

f Ad hoc analyses were conducted for the sexual abuse models, which
determined that limited variability across income was creating unstable results
for these models. To resolve this problem, the sexual abuse models were
further stratified by income of less than CaD$80 000 and CaD$80 000 or
more (<US$58 593 and �US$58 593) (determined using data distribution).

sure (AOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.6; P < .05). In contrast, child abuse
exposure was associated with past-year suicidal ideation
(AOR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6-2.9; P < .05) and suicide plans (AOR, 2.7;
95% CI, 1.7-4.3; P < .05) and remained significant after adjust-
ing for deployment-related trauma (AORs, 2.1 [95% CI,
1.6-2.9] and 2.6 [95% CI, 1.6-4.2], respectively; P < .05). No in-
teraction effects between child abuse exposure and deploy-
ment-related trauma were noted.
Discussion
This study advances knowledge with the following novel find-
ings.First,inCanada,childabuseexposureismorelikelyamong
military personnel compared with the general population. Sec-
ond, although child abuse exposure is associated with in-
creased odds of suicidal ideation, suicide plans, and suicide at-
temptsamongtheCGP,RegularForces,andReserveForces,the
effect of child abuse exposure on suicide-related outcomes is
generally stronger among the CGP compared with military per-
sonnel.Third,deployment-relatedtraumawasassociatedwith
past-year suicidal ideation and suicide plans; however, in com-
parison,childabuseexposurewasmorestronglyandmorecon-
sistently associated with suicide-related outcomes.
Almost half of all military personnel in Canada have a his-
tory of child abuse exposure, which is a higher prevalence than
in the general population. We are unable to determine why this
is the case, but escaping from child abuse exposure at home26
orotherwiseimprovinglifecircumstanceswithcareerandedu-
cation opportunities available through the military may be the
cause. Although child abuse exposure was associated with sui-
cide-related outcomes among civilians and military person-
nel, the effects were often greater among civilians. Fortu-
nately, not everyone with a history of child abuse exposure will
experience poor mental health outcomes. Military screening
and selection procedures at the time of recruitment and dur-
ing continued military service may select more resilient indi-
viduals and exclude the less resilient. In addition, positive as-
pects of the military, such as escaping a negative home
environment or community and/or having meaningful and se-
cure income and employment, may attenuate the negative ef-
fects of child abuse exposure on suicide-related outcomes.
However, we are unable to determine whether this attenua-
tion is the case with our data. Further research is necessary to
determine what factors may be attenuating the negative ef-
fects of childhood abuse among military personnel.
When examining deployment-related trauma and child
abuse exposure in separate models, both experiences
increased the likelihood of suicide-related outcomes.
Although deployment-related trauma is often examined in
relation to suicide in military samples,1,5-8 only a few studies
have examined the importance of child abuse exposure.21
The present study finds that the relationship between child
abuse exposure and suicide-related outcomes was robust in
all models and a stronger indicator of suicide-related
outcomes than deployment-related trauma.
Strengthsofthisstudyincludethelargeandnationallyrep-
resentative data of the CGP and CAF collected at a similar time
point using the same sampling designs and measures. How-
ever, several limitations apply. First, the data are cross-
sectional, self-reported, and retrospective, which preclude
causal inferences. Although the data are retrospective, evi-
dence suggests the accuracy of recall of self-reported adverse
childhood events.39-41 Second, although including Reserve
Forces personnel adds originality, the sample was not repre-
sentativebecauseitonlyincludedReserveForceswhohadbeen
deployed in support of the mission in Afghanistan. Also, be-
cause the Reserve Forces sample was small, they could not be
included in all analyses, and some models may have been un-
derpowered. Third, measures of neglect and emotional abuse
were not included in either survey. Fourth, the focus of this
work was child abuse, but other nonoccupational trauma may
be important. Fifth, we cannot determine precisely the tem-
porality of onset of trauma (in childhood and on deployment)
and suicide-related outcomes. Finally, selection effects re-
lated to stringent occupational fitness standards may pre-
clude the recruitment of some suicide-vulnerable individu-
als and may deplete suicide-vulnerable individuals from the
military population as they develop during service. Although
these selection effects certainly occur, our findings demon-
strate that they do not extend to child abuse exposure, for
which military personnel are at increased risk.
Conclusions
Approximately half of military personnel in Canada begin their
service with a history of child abuse exposure, a proportion
that is higher than among civilians. However, the association
between child abuse exposure and suicide-related outcomes
was often significantly weaker in military personnel relative
to civilians. The higher prevalence and the broad negative ef-
fects of child abuse exposure make this finding an important
public health concern in the military, as in civilians. Deploy-

ment-related trauma was associated with past-year suicide-
related outcomes, but the association was attenuated when
adjusting for child abuse exposure. In addition, when deploy-
ment-related trauma was experienced with child abuse expo-
sure, the effect on past-year suicidal ideation and suicide plans
were additive among Regular Forces personnel. Child abuse
exposure,however,wasassociatedwithallsuicide-relatedout-
comes, even when adjusting for deployment-related trauma.
Therefore, prevention efforts targeting child abuse exposure
or mediators in the relationship between child abuse expo-
sure and suicide-related outcomes may help reduce suicide-
related outcomes.
