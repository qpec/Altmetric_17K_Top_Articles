Purpose: Recently, it has been shown that nocebo hyperalgesia can be acquired through 
observational learning. The aim of this study was to investigate socially induced nocebo hype-
ralgesia and its relationship with pain catastrophizing, somatic complaints, hypochondriacal 
concerns, and empathy.
Participants and methods: Ninety-seven women (43.1±15.5 years) were randomly assigned 
to one of the two conditions. Participants in the nocebo condition (NC) watched a video in 
which a female model displayed more pain when an ointment was applied and less pain when 
no ointment was applied. In the control condition (CC), the model demonstrated low pain with 
and without the ointment. Subsequently, all participants received three pressure pain stimuli 
(60 seconds) on each hand. On one hand, the ointment was applied prior to the stimulation. 
The order of the stimulation of the fingers (middle, index, or ring finger), the side of ointment 
application (left or right hand), and the side with which the stimulation began were random-
ized within each group and balanced across the groups. Depending on the randomization, the 
pressure pain application started with or without ointment and on the left or right hand. Pain 
ratings on a numerical rating scale (0–10) were collected. In addition, the participants completed 
questionnaires regarding body-related cognitive styles and empathy.
Results: There was a significant difference in the pain ratings between the CC and the NC. 
The effect of ointment application was also significant, but no interaction between condition 
and ointment application was found. Only in the CC did the nocebo response correlate with 
hypochondriacal concerns and somatic complaints.
Conclusion: Application of an ointment as well as the observation of a model demonstrating 
more pain after a treatment produced elevated pain ratings. Cognitive styles were not related to 
the socially induced nocebo response, but were related to the nocebo response in the CC.
Keywords: nocebo response, pain, social observation, pain catastrophizing, hypochondriasis
Introduction
Expecting a negative outcome from an intervention may give rise to the very occur-
rence of that outcome. This phenomenon, called the “nocebo effect”, can be induced 
by conditioning, verbal suggestion,1,2 or, as recently shown, by social observation; 
with student samples, two studies independently showed that observing a person 
who experienced pain after a particular intervention could lead to nocebo hyperal-
gesia when the observer underwent the same procedure.3,4 In one of the studies, four 
groups observed a model who reported lower pain ratings when a green rather than 
a red light preceded a pseudo-electric shock, whereas two other groups observed no 
model.3 Participants in all groups received electric shocks. The aim of the study was

to investigate socially induced placebo analgesia with the 
green light-coupled shocks; however, when compared to the 
control groups without observation, a nocebo hyperalgesia 
to the red light-coupled electric shocks was induced. In the 
second study, female students watched a video model who 
rated pain as higher when an ointment was applied prior to the 
application of pressure pain.4 This also resulted in nocebo 
hyperalgesia in the observer.
Very little is known about why some people respond to 
placebos while others do not;5 the same is true for nocebos. 
For socially induced nocebo hyperalgesia, there was an effect 
of the model’s sex; observing a male model led to a stronger 
hyperalgesia regardless of the observer’s sex.3 Empathy 
might be a factor specifically related to socially induced 
nocebo hyperalgesia, as it might facilitate observational 
learning. However, results thus far are inconsistent.3 Studies 
concerning other factors influencing the nocebo response, as 
such, are rare. Personality variables, such as suggestibility, 
imaginative involvement, social desirability, and neuroticism, 
appear to be unrelated to verbally induced nocebo hyperal-
gesia.2 The cognitive–emotional variables pain anxiety and 
somatosensory amplification showed no correlation with 
nocebo hyperalgesia, whereas pain catastrophizing did show 
a correlation: the stronger the tendency to catastrophize, the 
stronger the nocebo hyperalgesia.4
In the present study, we further investigated cogni-
tive processing styles that may be related to the nocebo 
response. The expectation of adverse somatosensory events,6 
catastrophic misinterpretation, or overinterpretation of 
body sensations or physical symptoms7 and selective atten-
tion to bodily processes can affect the encoding of sensory 
information and impact symptom reports in general,8,9 
and – we hypothesize – nocebo responses in particular. In 
addition, hypochondriacal concerns may influence the nocebo 
response, as they correlated positively with the number of 
retrospective reports of vicarious learning experiences related 
to bodily symptoms during childhood, and the authors con-
cluded that persons with hypochondriacal concerns learned 
about symptoms through social observation.10
The aim of the present study was to investigate further 
socially induced nocebo effects and possible moderators of 
the socially induced nocebo hyperalgesia, such as pain cata-
strophizing, somatic complaints, hypochondriacal concerns, 
and empathy, in a sample from the general population.
In order to be terminologically unequivocal, we will dis-
tinguish between “nocebo effect” and “nocebo response”. The 
term “nocebo effect” is reserved for statistically ascertained 
differences at the group level, whereas the term “nocebo 
response” refers to the difference resulting from subtracting 
the pain ratings without nocebo induction from the pain rat-
ings with nocebo induction at an individual level.
Participants and methods
ethics
The study was approved by the local ethics committee 
(Ethikkommission des Instituts für Psychologie, Georg-
August-Universität Göttingen, Approval number 55) and was 
carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.11 
Informed written consent was obtained prior to testing. 
Since a deceptive information procedure was used, after the 
experiment, the participants were fully debriefed regarding 
the deceptive information and the necessity of using this pro-
cedure, and were given the opportunity to ask questions.
Participants
Participants were recruited via newspaper and billboard 
advertisements. Differences in pain sensitivity between 
healthy men and women have been replicated in numerous 
studies,12 which showed that experimenter sex influenced pain 
reports13,14 and that the sex of the model3 and participants15 
influenced socially induced nocebo effects. Therefore, we 
kept these factors constant by employing a female model and 
including only women in our study. For the power analysis, 
we used the effect size of partial η2=0.09 found for the inter-
action in our last paper as an approximation. We converted 
it via G*Power to the effect size f (V)=0.31.16 A minimum 
total sample size of N=82 participants was required to detect 
an interaction effect of that size (α=0.05 and power =0.80). 
Since, in our last study, participants had to be excluded, 
we decided to recruit more participants than the minimum 
required. A total of 109 healthy, right-handed women were 
randomly assigned to one of the two conditions. Twelve 
women were excluded after testing but before data analyses, 
as they reported suffering from depression (four), anorexia 
nervosa (one), anxiety disorders (two), agoraphobia (one), 
arthrosis (one), chronic back pain (one), fibromyalgia (one), 
and craniomandibular dysfunction (one). The remaining 
97 participants (mean age nocebo condition [NC] 41.3±15.5 
years, mean age control condition [CC] 44.7±15.5 years) 
were included in the analysis. The groups did not differ with 
regard to age (Table 1).
Design
A 2×2 mixed design with the between-factor “condition” 
(nocebo/neutral) and within-factor “ointment application” 
(yes/no) was employed. All participants received pressure pain

stimuli for 60 seconds per finger on the middle phalanx of the 
ring, middle, and index finger of each hand. The dependent 
measure was subjective pain intensity. Assignment to the 
conditions was randomized. The order of stimulation of the 
fingers (middle phalanx of index, middle, and ring finger), the 
starting hand (right/left), the side of the ointment application 
(left/right), and whether the person’s first or second hand was 
treated with ointment were balanced between the groups. Upon 
the participant’s arrival at the laboratory, the experimenter 
drew a “lot” out of an envelope specifying these factors.
Procedure
Participants were contacted via the telephone and were sent 
a set of questionnaires (Symptom Inventory, Whiteley Index 
[WI], Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS-D], see 
the “Measures” section) to fill out at home prior to coming 
to the laboratory. Participants received 20 euros for their 
participation.
Upon arrival at the laboratory, participants read the infor-
mation that the influence of nonverbal instruction in pain 
experiments would be tested. To this end, they would be asked 
to watch a video in which the procedure was demonstrated by 
actions. No information concerning the possible effect of the 
ointment was provided. To focus their attention on the video, 
they received five questions about the video prior to viewing 
and were told that they would have to answer the questions 
after the video. The conditions differed solely with regard 
to the model’s pain ratings in the video the participants were 
shown; in the NC, the model reported higher pain ratings after 
the application of an ointment, and in the CC, the model’s 
ratings were low throughout (see the “Video” section).
After they viewed the video and answered the related 
questions, the participants underwent the same procedure as 
they observed in the video. Depending on the randomization, 
pressure pain application started with or without ointment. 
The ointment (see the “Materials” section) was applied on the 
middle phalanx of the index, middle, and ring finger of one 
hand and allowed to take effect for 60 seconds as shown in the 
video. Pressure pain was applied by a stationary pressure pain 
algometer (see the “Materials” section) on the middle phalanx 
of the index, middle, and ring finger for 60 seconds on each of 
the three fingers of both hands. During the application, partici-
pants were asked to indicate the intensity of the pain verbally 
every 20 seconds on an eleven-point numerical rating scale 
with 0 indicating “no pain at all” and 10 indicating “the worst 
pain imaginable”. The investigators recorded responses.
After the pain application procedure, participants filled 
out the remaining questionnaires (Interpersonal Reactivity 
Index [IRI] and Pain Catastrophizing Scale [PCS]). Finally, 
they wrote down which questions they thought were being 
examined by the study and rated the credibility of the 
cover story. An overview of the procedure is presented in 
Figure 1.
To increase the credibility of the procedure, professional 
surroundings for the experiment were created (health care

products, disinfectant spray), and the experimenters wore 
white medical coats and gloves when applying the ointment. 
The experimenters were trained and supervised by the first 
and senior authors (EV and AB). They were blind to the con-
ditions and were only given code numbers of the videos to 
be shown. The participants wore headphones while watching 
the video, so that only they could hear the pain ratings. The 
group assignments were revealed to the experimenters only 
after the data from all participants had been collected.
Video
The videos were recorded in the same room in which the 
subsequent experiment took place. Both videos showed a 
seated female model in her mid-forties and the hands of 
a female experimenter. The videos were recorded from an 
angle behind the model so that the model’s face was only 
partially visible (Figure 2). The videos lasted 10 minutes 
and 3 seconds each. In both videos, the experimenter told 
the model that pressure pain stimuli would be applied and 
explained the rating scale on which the pain intensity was to 
be rated. The pressure application started on the right hand 
without ointment. The model rated the pain intensity verbally 
on the eleven-point numerical rating scale. The model’s rat-
ings for the hand without ointment in both conditions ranged 
from 2 to 3. After all three fingers of the right hand had been 
stimulated, an ointment was applied to the model’s left hand 
and allowed to take effect for 60 seconds. Then the applica-
tion of pressure pain resumed. In the video for the NC, the 
model demonstrated an increase in pain after the ointment 
application by rating the pain for the hand with ointment from 
5 to 7. In the video for the CC, the model demonstrated no 
effect of the ointment on the pain ratings. The model’s ratings 
for the hand with ointment were identical to those without the 
ointment, ie, ranging from 2 to 3. The videos were identical 
in facial expressions, body posture, and tone of voice.
Materials
Pain was induced by a stationary pressure pain algometer, 
which delivered constant pressure over a fixed period. The 
algometer consisted of a lever with a weight, and a plunger 
with a surface area of 3 mm2 was located at the end. An 
electric motor lowered the lever with the plunger onto the 
finger when a button was pressed, and the lever rose automati-
cally after a predetermined period. As a safety measure, the 
procedure could be stopped immediately by pushing a button. 
A weight of 300 g set at 8 cm was used, resulting in a total 
pressure of 0.92 MPa, which was applied for 60 seconds.
A standard hypoallergenic ointment served as the nocebo. 
It contained the following ingredients: aqua, caprylic/capric 
triglyceride, glycerin, pentylene glycol, Cocos nucifera, 
hydrogenated lecithin, Vitellaria paradoxa, hydroxyethylcel-
lulose, squalane, sodium carbomer, xanthan gum, carbomer, 
and ceramide 3. It was presented in a neutral container, 
similar to those used by dispensing chemists, and contained 
no perfume. The ointment itself had no pharmacological 
influence on pain perception.
Measures
Since the pain measures and empathy were directly related 
to our experimental design, we decided to collect these mea-
sures after the application of pain to avoid any speculations 
about the aim of our study. In order to reduce the time for 
the participants in our laboratory, they were sent the other 
questionnaires (not concerning the pain measures or empa-
thy) to fill in at home prior to the appointment.
The trait pain catastrophizing was measured with the 
German version of the PCS, which consisted of 13 items 
answered on a five-point scale ranging from 0 (“not at all”) 
to 4 (“all the time”).17,18 A sum score (min =0, max =52) 
and scores for each of the three subscales were calculated. 
The subscale “Rumination” (min =0, max =16) described 
the inability to stop thoughts concerning pain. The items 
of the subscale “Magnification” (min =0, max =12) reflected 
the tendency to exaggerate the threat value of pain stimuli. 
“Helplessness” (min =0, max =24) described the inability 
to deal with pain.
Unspecific somatic complaints were measured with the 
German Symptom Inventory (Beschwerdeliste, BL-R).19 The 
participants indicated the degree to which they suffered from 
Figure 2 still picture of the pressure pain application video.
Notes: Pressure pain is applied to the model’s left ring finger. Only the experimenter’s 
hands were visible during the entire video.

each somatic symptom (eg, constipation, insomnia, shortness 
of breath, or lack of energy) on a four-point scale ranging 
from 0 (“not at all”) to 3 (“strongly”). There were two parallel 
versions: each consisted of 24 items (min =0, max =72 for 
each version). In order to improve reliability, we used both 
versions (ie, 48 items) and averaged the values.
To measure hypochondriacal concerns, the German ver-
sion of the WI was used. It consisted of 14 items that the 
participant indicated as present or not (min =0, max =14).20
The German version of the IRI (Saarbrücker Persönlich-
keitsfragebogen) was used to assess trait empathy.21,22 The 
questionnaire consisted of 16 items answered on a five-point 
scale ranging from 1 (“never”) to 5 (“always”) with the sub-
scale “Empathic Concern”, “Perspective-taking”, “Fantasy”, 
and “Personal Distress” (min =4, max =20, for each scale). 
The global score (min =12, max =60) was calculated by sum-
ming the scales “Empathic Concern”, ”Perspective-taking”, 
and “Fantasy”.23
As control measures, depression and anxiety were assessed 
with the German version of the HADS-D.24 The HADS-D is 
a 14-item self-report scale designed to measure depression 
and anxiety symptoms in the previous week. The items were 
answered on a four-point scale with item-specific response 
categories (min =0, max =21 for each scale).
In addition, participants were asked to rate the credibility 
of the cover story on a scale ranging from 0 (“not credible at 
all”) to 10 (“completely credible”).
hypotheses
The following hypotheses were tested:
1. An interaction exists between condition and ointment 
application for the pain ratings.
2. In the NC, pain ratings are higher with ointment than 
without ointment.
3. The pain ratings with ointment are higher in the NC than 
in the CC.
4. In the NC, positive correlations exist between the nocebo 
response and empathy, pain catastrophizing, unspecific 
somatic complaints, and hypochondriacal concerns.
Data analysis
Differences regarding age, depression, anxiety, pain cata-
strophizing, unspecific somatic complaints, hypochondriacal 
concerns, and the credibility ratings between the participants 
in the two conditions were compared with independent 
t-tests.
Prior tests showed that the assumptions for a 2×2 repeated 
measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) were fulfilled: the 
data were normally distributed (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) 
and variances were homogeneous (Levene’s test). In order 
to test the interaction hypothesis for the nocebo effect, the 
mean pain intensity score for each hand was calculated, and 
a 2×2 repeated measures ANOVA with between-subject fac-
tor condition (NC/CC) and within-subject factor application 
of ointment (yes/no) was computed. Planned contrasts were 
calculated using independent or paired t-tests as appro-
priate. As measures of effect sizes, η2 and Cohen’s d were 
calculated.
The nocebo response for each individual participant was 
determined by the difference between the mean pain intensity 
ratings with and without ointment for that participant. Higher 
values indicated a stronger nocebo response.
Pearson correlations were computed for each condition 
for the nocebo response with empathy, pain catastroph-
izing, unspecific somatic complaints, and hypochondriacal 
concerns. The level of significance was set at P,0.05. All 
analyses were carried out with STATISTICA for Windows 
software, version 10 (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA).
Results
There were no differences in depression, anxiety, empathy, 
pain catastrophizing, the score on the complaints list, and 
hypochondriacal concerns between the conditions (Table 1). 
The t-test of the credibility ratings for the information con-
cerning the ointment revealed no differences between the 
two conditions (t[92] =0.05, P=0.96).
The 2×2 repeated measures ANOVA revealed a signifi-
cant effect of condition (F[1, 95] =4.76, P=0.03, η2=0.04) 
as well as a significant effect of ointment application 
(F[1, 95] =26.62, P=0.000001, η2=0.04) on the pain ratings. 
According to Cohen,25 these were small effects. There was 
no interaction between condition x ointment (F[1, 95] =0.68, 
P=0.41]. The paired t-test identified higher pain intensity 
with as compared to without ointment within the NC (t[46] 
=3.57, P=0.0008, d=0.38). According to Cohen, the effect 
was of approximately medium size.25 The independent t-test 
identified higher pain intensity with ointment in the NC than 
in the CC (t[95] =–2.18, P=0.03, d=0.44). The effect was of 
a medium size. Exploratory analyses identified higher pain 
intensities with as compared to without ointment within the 
CC (t[49] =3.82, P=0.0004, d=0.38) and no differences in 
pain ratings without ointment between CC and NC (t[95] 
=–1.85, P=0.07, d=0.37) (Figure 3 and Table 2).
For the NC, none of the expected correlations were 
observed (Table 3). In the CC, exploratory analyses revealed 
that the nocebo response was positively correlated with the

Discussion
We examined whether a nocebo hyperalgesia to pressure 
pain could be induced by social observational learning in 
a female general population sample. There was no interac-
tion between condition and ointment application. However, 
main effects for condition and ointment application on the 
pain ratings were observed. Planned comparisons revealed 
that, within the NC, participants reported more pain with 
as compared to without ointment, so a nocebo effect for the 
NC was observed. Unexpectedly, pain ratings in the CC with 
ointment were higher than without, so a pain increase after 
ointment application was observed in the CC too. Due to 
the unexpected pain increase with ointment in the CC, no 
interaction was observed. The pain ratings with ointment 
were higher in the NC than in the CC, indicating that the 
observation of the model had an additional effect on pain 
perception. Contrary to our hypothesis, in the NC, no cor-
relation between the nocebo response and empathy, pain 
catastrophizing, hypochondriacal concerns, or the amount 
of bodily symptoms was observed. In contrast, in the CC, 
we found that the higher a person’s level of hypochondriacal 
concerns was and the more bodily symptoms she reported, 
the higher was the nocebo response.
The social observation induced elevated pain ratings to 
pressure pain, since participants in the NC who watched a 
model demonstrating higher pain ratings after the application 
of an ointment rated pressure pain with ointment as more 
painful than the participants in the CC who watched a model 
demonstrating no change in pain perception after the applica-
tion of an ointment. By watching a video in which pain was 
demonstrated by a model, the participants might have built 
up the expectation of pain when an ointment is applied. The 
expectation of pain might have led to anxiety, which facilitates 
pain perception.26 According to Benedetti et al26 and Colloca 
and Benedetti,27 anxiety is an important mechanism in nocebo 
hyperalgesia. Hyperalgesia is known to occur when anticipa-
tory anxiety regarding pain itself is experienced, and also if 
attention is directed toward the pain.5,26,27 These processes may 
have had an effect on pain perception in the NC.
In addition, ointment application induced higher pain 
ratings, since participants rated pain with the ointment as 
more painful than without in the CC. We can rule out the 
possibility that any active ingredient of the ointment altered 
pain perception, since the ointment did not contain any active 
substances. In addition, in our last study, no such effects were 
observed.4 Due to the common practice of using ointments for 
pain relief, the ointment could have triggered the expectation 
of pain relief despite the information from the video. It is 
unclear why a pain increase emerged. Perhaps the psycho-
social context, which has been shown to strongly influence

nocebo response, social observation, and body-related cognitive styles
nocebo effects, triggered the expectation of an increase in 
pain.26,27 The experimenters wore white medical coats and 
gloves; medical supplies were in the room and it smelled 
of disinfectant spray. This may have led to the expectation 
that something painful was imminent that required the prior 
application of an ointment. Therefore, the participants might 
have built up the expectation of pain when the ointment was 
applied.
Due to the observation of a video model, which demon-
strated higher pain after the application of an ointment, pain 
ratings in the NC with ointment were higher than without 
ointment and higher than with ointment in the CC. The pain 
increase due to the ointment application in the CC explained 
why no nocebo (interaction) effect was observed.
The described results were compatible with the results of 
our former study.4 In the verbal CC of that study, we provided 
explicit verbal information that the ointment would have no 
effect on pain experience and, consequently, observed no 
nocebo response. In the presence of less definite information, 
as in our present study, the ointment application might have 
activated the expectation of pain, as argued earlier.
Contrary to our expectation and the results of our previous 
study, we found no correlation between pain catastrophizing 
and nocebo response in the NC.4 Neither did we find an asso-
ciation between individual nocebo response and unspecific 
somatic complaints or hypochondriasis. The absence of such 
effects is in line with earlier studies, in which attempts to find 
variables predicting the placebo response failed to produce 
strong or consistent results.28,29 For the placebo response, it 
was concluded that the situation should be taken into account 
and the interaction of situational variables and personality 
traits should be investigated.28,29 The same may be concluded 
for the nocebo response.
Unexpectedly, in the CC, the symptom inventory and 
the nocebo response were positively associated (moderate 
effect size): the more somatic symptoms a person reported, 
in general, the more likely she was to report higher pain 
after the application of the ointment. This result may have 
reached significance by chance and should be replicated. 
If future research confirms these associations, a reason for 
this could lie in a top-down driven symptom perception, a 
process especially prominent in people with a tendency to 
report many negative somatosensory events.30 Top-down 
driven processes may contribute to turning bodily sensa-
tions into symptoms by mobilizing schematic information 
resulting from the person’s learning history. The schema 
influences the allocation of attention and the way sensations 
are interpreted or appraised.7,9,30 In the CC, people with 
many unexplained symptoms and a more top-down driven 
processing style may have ignored the diverging information 
that the ointment does not change pain perception and relied 
more on their schema “ointment application means pain”. As 
a result, their pain perception may have increased when the 
ointment was applied. In the presence of the information that 
the ointment increases pain perception (NC), the individual 
tendency for such interpretations had no influence, and an 
increase in pain was experienced irrespective of the level of 
symptom reporting.
In a similar vein, a positive correlation between hypo-
chondriacal concerns and the nocebo response was observed 
in the CC. The same mechanisms explained earlier can be 
applied for this result. This was in line with the findings 
that health-anxious people focused on their own negative 
reactions to pain, failed to make use of positive information 
adequately, and reported more catastrophic thoughts about the 
meaning and implications of pain.31 One possible explanation 
could be that the more health anxious a person was, the less 
she made use of the positive information that the ointment 
does not change the pain experience.
No correlation between trait empathy and nocebo response 
was found. This reproduced the negative result obtained in our 
previous study.4 In that study, we could not exclude that the 
negative result was due to the limited variability of the – rather 
high – empathy scores in our sample. In the present study, 
a community sample with more variability (empathy scale 
standard deviation [SD] =5.2 as opposed to 3.3 in our last 
study) was tested, and still, no correlation was found. In the 
study by Swider and Babel, the subscales “Empathic Concern” 
and “Personal Distress” predicted the nocebo response.3 In a 
recent study comparing a face-to-face versus a prerecorded 
observation of placebo analgesia, Hunter et al found no cor-
relation between empathic concern and placebo analgesia in 
the video replay group, but they did observe a correlation 
in the live observation group.32 Although this has not been 
investigated for nocebo hyperalgesia, the video presentation 
of the model could possibly explain the lack of correlation 
between trait empathy and nocebo response.
The study had several methodological strengths. A profes-
sional, medical environment was created to strengthen the 
trust of the participants in the investigation. The credibility 
ratings of the cover story were high and there were no dif-
ferences between the conditions, indicating that the instruc-
tion was accepted by all participants. After the experiment, 
we asked the participants to guess the purpose of the study. In 
order to classify the responses, four independent raters judged 
the participants’ answers to see whether they might have

discovered the real aim of our study. Only three participants 
speculated about placebo/nocebo effects as the topic of 
research (they were not excluded from the analysis).
Experimenter expectations may exert an influence on the 
results in placebo studies, and it is reasonable to think that the 
same may be true for nocebo studies.33 In order to forestall 
such effects, the experimenters in the current study were blind 
with regard to the participants’ assigned condition. In addition, 
they were trained with the support of a video to conduct the 
experiment in a highly standardized manner. In summary, we 
did not detect any factor endangering internal validity.
Expectations are crucial to the nocebo response.26,27 We 
did not ask the participants about their expectations regarding 
the ointment application and, therefore, can only indirectly 
infer that such expectations were induced. Our results sug-
gested that we induced the expectation of increased pain in 
both the conditions. In future studies, the expectations should 
be directly assessed.
Our study was not without limitations. One limitation 
related to the sample tested: all participants were women and 
they observed a female model; thus, the results were limited to 
observational learning in women with female models. Since we 
investigated acute, experimentally induced pain, it remains an 
open question whether our results apply to naturally occurring 
or chronic pain. We did not control for the effect of anxiety, 
which might have facilitated a nocebo response.26,27 In our last 
study, however, we did not find an association between nocebo 
response and state or trait anxiety.4
Conclusion
As hypothesized, the observation of a model demonstrating 
pain led to an increase in the pain experience, so, again, a 
socially induced nocebo effect was observed. In addition, 
the application of an ointment led to higher pain ratings, pos-
sibly by way of invoking pain schemas. It appears that, in the 
absence of definite information, health- and body-related 
cognitive styles influence these nocebo responses. If further 
studies confirm our results that even the observation of pain in 
general or the unexplained administration of an intervention 
can lead to hyperalgesia, this may have implications for clini-
cal trials concerned with pain and its assessment. In addition, 
these considerations could be applied to minimize the unnec-
essary expectation-induced pain in medical procedures.
