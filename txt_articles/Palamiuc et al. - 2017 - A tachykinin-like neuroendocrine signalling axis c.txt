sensing with peripheral lipid metabolism

Serotonin, a central neuromodulator with ancient ties to feeding and metabolism, is a major
driver of body fat loss. However, mechanisms by which central serotonin action leads to fat
loss remain unknown. Here, we report that the FLP-7 neuropeptide and its cognate receptor,
NPR-22, function as the ligand-receptor pair that defines the neuroendocrine axis of
serotonergic body fat loss in Caenorhabditis elegans. FLP-7 is secreted as a neuroendocrine
peptide in proportion to fluctuations in neural serotonin circuit functions, and its release
is regulated from secretory neurons via the nutrient sensor AMPK. FLP-7 acts via the
NPR-22/Tachykinin2 receptor in the intestine and drives fat loss via the adipocyte triglyceride
lipase ATGL-1. Importantly, this ligand-receptor pair does not alter other serotonin-dependent
behaviours including food intake. For global modulators such as serotonin, the use of distinct
neuroendocrine peptides for each output may be one means to achieve phenotypic
selectivity.

 T
he central nervous system plays a critical role in regulating
energy balance and body fat stores, distinct from its effects
on feeding behaviour. In recent years, strong evidence
across metazoan systems has emerged to show that different brain
regions potently control lipid metabolism in peripheral tissues,
independently of changes in feeding behaviour1–3. Thus, discrete
neural circuits and neuronal subpopulations regulate body
fat metabolism. Although for certain central regulators the
neural
circuits
governing
peripheral
metabolism
are
now
beginning to be understood, identifying neuroendocrine factors
that selectively govern fat metabolism has remained a long-
standing challenge. Additionally, the extent to which nutrient
sensing by the brain modulates peripheral metabolism via such
neuroendocrine factors is poorly understood.
The ancient central nervous system neuromodulator serotonin
(5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a valuable paradigm for the
study of global regulators of animal physiology. In metazoans,
5-HT controls food intake and feeding behaviour, mood,
adiposity, locomotion and energy expenditure4–6. In humans,
with respect to the control of energy balance, global serotonergic
agonists and antagonists have long been administered to suppress
appetite, increase energy expenditure, or both7,8. However the
limited efficacy of these global serotonin-boosting compounds is
often accompanied by substantial side effects, and has mitigated
their use. Yet, the importance of 5-HT signalling in stimulating
fat
metabolism
across
many
species
suggests
that
the
identification of selective factors that function downstream of
central 5-HT to stimulate fat metabolism would be valuable.
A body of evidence has revealed a broad framework for the effects
of neuronal 5-HT on whole body energy balance by exploiting the
tractability of the C. elegans system9,10. Manipulations of 5-HT
levels via exogenous administration or by endogenous control
using genetic approaches reveal that, as in mammals, neuronal 5-
HT is a potent stimulator of body fat loss and energy
expenditure11.
In
the
nematode
C.
elegans,
5-HT
is
synthesized
by
the conserved rate-limiting enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase
(TPH-1) in only a few pairs of neurons, and is not present in
the intestine or in other metabolic tissues under normal
conditions5. Loss of the TPH-1 enzyme leads to undetectable
levels of neuronal 5-HT and a significant increase in body fat
reserves
accompanied
by
decreased
energy
expenditure.
Functional
studies
reveal
that
of
all
the
biogenic
amine
receptors in the genome, a 5-HT-gated chloride channel called
MOD-1 is the sole receptor essential for body fat loss1. In the
intestine, the major metabolic organ for C. elegans and the
predominant site for fat metabolism, the rate-limiting enzyme
adipocyte triglyceride lipase ATGL-1 is transcriptionally induced
by 5-HT signalling and serves to stimulate fat breakdown via
hydrolysis of stored triglycerides to fatty acids1. RNAi-based
screens also revealed that increased 5-HT signalling elicits a
cascade of b-oxidation enzymes in the intestine that convert fatty
acids to energy in the mitochondria11.
Despite its neuronal origins, the metabolic effects of 5-HT
occur in the intestine. In our previous work, we deciphered the
neural circuit for 5-HTergic fat mobilization in C. elegans1. We
found that 5-HT synthesis is required in the ADF chemosensory
neurons whereas MOD-1 the critical serotonergic channel is
necessary and sufficient in a single pair of neurons called URX,
which receive direct synaptic input from the ADF neurons.
Additionally, we found that octopamine (OA), the invertebrate
analogue of adrenaline, provides a permissive cue to maintain
5-HT signalling via regulating tph-1 expression and 5-HT levels
in the ADF neurons. Thus, the primary components of the 5-HT
pathway: the biosynthetic enzyme and the receptor, reside in
the nervous system, and the collective evidence indicates that
5-HTergic regulation of body fat loss occurs indirectly, perhaps
via the relay of neuroendocrine factor/s from the nervous system,
to the intestine1. It has remained a challenge to identify selective
neuroendocrine factors that stimulate body fat mobilization
downstream
of
central
mediators
of
energy
balance,
in
any system. Pioneering biochemical approaches were used to
identify neuropeptide hormones that communicate in endocrine
fashion from the mammalian hypothalamus to control the
physiology of stature, reproduction and other aspects of whole
animal
physiology12–14.
Despite
these
immense
advances,
biochemical approaches relying on the relative abundance of
peptides in the mammalian hypothalamus did not lead to the
identification of neuroendocrine hormones that control body
weight, and endocrine factors that potently stimulate body fat loss
have since remained unknown.
In this study, we identify a secreted neuropeptide ligand and its
cognate receptor that constitute the core 5-HT neuroendocrine
axis and selectively stimulates body fat loss in C. elegans.
The ligand is secreted in proportion to 5-HT circuit functions and
the activity of the nutrient sensor AMPK, in the secretory
neurons. In the intestine, activation of the receptor promotes fat
loss via induction of the ATGL-1 lipase. The broad conservation
of this signalling axis suggests that such approaches are valuable
in identifying novel and selective neuroendocrine factors that
underlie the central control of body fat metabolism.
Results
Neuropeptide signalling is required for 5-HT-mediated fat loss.
Our previous work describing the 5-HTergic neural circuit
revealed that rather than 5-HT itself, an unknown neuroendo-
crine factor is released from the nervous system and relayed to
metabolic tissues to stimulate body fat loss1. The C. elegans
intestine is not directly innervated (www.wormatlas.org) and
therefore offers a valuable platform to identify neuroendocrine
factors that communicate between the nervous system and
the metabolic tissues. The diversity of known mechanisms
of neuroendocrine signalling across different species prompted
us to use a process of elimination followed by a screen. To begin
investigating the nature of this neuroendocrine signal, we first
measured the extent to which serotonin-mediated fat loss
was dependent upon the release of canonical neurotransmitters
(acetylcholine, g-amino butyric acid and glutamate), versus
that
of
neuropeptidergic
signals.
In
the
nervous
system,
canonical neurotransmitters are localized to clear synaptic
vesicles, which require a protein called UNC-13 (MUNC-13 in
mammals) for fusion with the plasma membrane at the
synapse15,16. On the other hand, neuropeptides and biogenic
amine neurotransmitters are localized to dense core vesicles,
which require the conserved calcium-dependent activator protein
(CAPS) or UNC-31/CAPS in C. elegans17–19. Both unc-13 and
unc-31 are broadly expressed in the C. elegans nervous system,
and not in other tissues. Thus, loss of unc-13 function leads
to a block in the release of the canonical neurotransmitters,
whereas loss of unc-31 blocks the release of neuropeptides and
biogenic amines. We measured the extent to which unc-13 and
unc-31 mutants were essential in promoting 5-HT-mediated
fat loss. With respect to body fat content, vehicle-treated
unc-13 mutants resembled wild-type animals; however, unc-31
mutants had B50% greater body fat than either genotype
(Fig. 1a), suggesting that the contents of dense core vesicles from
the nervous system regulate fat stores under basal conditions.
As
reported
previously1,11,
5HT-treated
wild-type
animals
retained approximately 40–50% of the body fat seen in vehicle-
treated controls, as did the unc-13 mutants (Fig. 1a). On the other
hand, 5-HT-treated unc-31 mutants fully suppressed serotonergic

 fat loss and retained as much body fat as the vehicle-treated
controls (Fig. 1a). Thus, a UNC-31/CAPS-dependent secretory
process is required for the effects of 5-HT on body fat loss.
The C. elegans genome encodes 113 neuropeptide genes, and
biosynthetic enzymes for four biogenic amines: 5-HT itself,
octopamine (OA), dopamine and tyramine20,21. Our previous
work had delineated a role for neuronal OA, the invertebrate
analogue of noradrenaline, in providing a permissive cue to
maintain 5-HT synthesis in the ADF chemosensory neurons.
Loss of the dopamine and tyramine biosynthetic enzymes did not
lead to appreciable differences in body fat with 5-HT treatment1.
In addition, we reported that 5-HT-induced fat loss was
independent
of
the
daf-2
insulin/IGF
receptor
and
its
downstream partner, daf-16/FOXO (ref. 11). Therefore we
next assessed the C. elegans neuropeptide genes for roles in
5-HT-mediated fat loss. Two predominant neuropeptide gene
families in C. elegans include the flp and nlp genes22, many of
which are functional orthologues of vertebrate neuropeptides
including oxytocin, vasopressin and the neuromedin family23–25.

 sequence homology to the insulin peptide family26. To identify
neuropeptides
that
relay
the
effects
of
neuronal
5-HT,
we screened the existing mutants of the flp/nlp/ins neuropeptide
gene families (77/113 genes; Fig. 1b) for suppression of
5-HT-induced fat loss. One neuropeptide gene called flp-7
emerged as a robust partial suppressor (Fig. 1b,c and Supple-
mentary Fig. 1a). Relative to wild-type animals, 5-HT-treated
flp-7(ok2625)
null mutants
retained a
significantly
greater
proportion of body fat (Fig. 1c; B45% versus B75%), whereas
vehicle-treated flp-7 mutants resembled wild-type animals. These
data suggested that flp-7 is required for 5-HT-induced fat loss.
In wild-type animals, constitutive overexpression of flp-7 under
its own promoter led to a readily apparent decrease in body
fat reserves (Fig. 1d), suggesting that its activity promotes
body fat loss.
Physiological properties of FLP-7. In examining the metabolic
effects of 5-HT in the intestine, we had previously uncovered
a role for ATGL-1, a conserved rate-limiting enzyme that
converts triglycerides into fatty acids27 that are in turn, utilized
for b-oxidation and energy production in the mitochondria1,11.
A reporter
line
and
qPCR
experiments
had
shown
that
5-HT treatment induces transcription of atgl-1 (ref. 1). Thus,
we examined whether flp-7 was required for 5-HT-mediated
atgl-1 induction. flp-7 mutants show a near-complete suppression
of the transcriptional induction of the atgl-1::GFP reporter line in
5-HT-treated animals (Fig. 1e,f). In addition, RNAi-mediated
inactivation of atgl-1 abrogated the increased fat loss seen with
flp-7 overexpression (Fig. 1d). These experiments show that
the effects of 5-HT on atgl-1-mediated fat loss require flp-7
signalling.
In C. elegans, in addition to its effects on body fat mobilization,
neuronal
5-HT
regulates
food
intake5,
reproduction
and
locomotor changes based on food availability6,28. Yet, the
5-HTergic regulation of body fat stores employs a distinct
neuronal circuit and regulatory cascade in the intestine1,11. To
address the question of how such selectivity might be achieved,
we measured the extent to which flp-7 is required for other
phenotypes associated with the food-5-HT signalling axis. We
found that loss of the flp-7 gene did not lead to changes in
5-HT-induced food intake (Fig. 1g), reproduction (Fig. 1h) or the
enhanced slowing response, a satiety-like locomotor response to
food availability (Fig. 1i). We note that flp-7 mutants have
a decreased egg-laying rate relative to wild-type animals (Fig. 1h);
however, the decreased egg-laying did not correlate with changes
in body fat because vehicle-treated flp-7 mutants do not display
a
body
fat
phenotype.
Instead,
flp-7
mutants
suppress
5-HT-induced fat loss without suppressing 5-HT-stimulated
egg-laying. Thus the serotonergic effects on egg-laying and
body fat loss are not causally linked by flp-7. Thus, under
conditions of serotonergic stimulation, the FLP-7 neuropeptide
selectively stimulates body fat loss. The flp-7 gene encodes
peptides that resemble the mammalian tachykinin peptide family
exemplified by Substance P (Supplementary Fig. 1b,c) and
are secreted neuropeptides regulating gut motility29, but have
not previously been associated with fat metabolism. Our data
suggest that FLP-7 is essential for serotonin-dependent fat loss,
and that its overexpression leads to a substantial reduction in
body fat stores.
The ASI neurosecretory neurons are the site of FLP-7 synthesis.
A fluorescent transgenic reporter line revealed that flp-7 is
expressed in a few pairs of head neurons (Fig. 2a). We wanted to
determine the identity of the neurons from which FLP-7
expression regulates 5-HT-induced body fat loss. A flp-7-rescuing
transgene under the control of its own promoter showed
vivid expression in a few pairs of head neurons (but not in the
intestine, the muscles or the hypodermis) and fully restored
5-HT-induced fat loss in the intestine (Fig. 2a,b). We observed
reproducible flp-7 expression in the ALA and the AVG inter-
neurons and in the ASI sensory neurons (Supplementary Fig. 2).

 and the AVG neuron is essential for ventral cord development31.
On the other hand, the ASI sensory neuron pair regulates whole
body physiology during development and is involved in lifespan
control via the secretion of regulatory peptides32–35. We tested
the sufficiency of flp-7 expression in ASI neurons using two
independent promoters, daf-7 and str-3, both of which fully
restored 5-HT-induced fat loss observed in flp-7 mutants
(Fig. 2b), to the same extent as seen in wild-type and flp-7
transgenic
animals.
Additionally,
RNAi-mediated
anti-sense
inhibition of the flp-7 gene in the ASI neurons recapitulated
the flp-7 mutant phenotype and led to robust suppression of
5-HT-induced fat loss (Fig. 2c). Thus, flp-7 expression in
ASI neurons is necessary and sufficient to maintain 5-HTergic
fat loss.
Visualizing FLP-7 neuropeptide secretion in living animals.
Although ASI neurons are the source of FLP-7, its effects on
fat loss occur in the intestine, the major site for body fat storage
and lipid metabolism9. Thus, we hypothesized that FLP-7 is
released as a secreted peptide from the ASI neurons. Previous
studies have shown that secreted neuropeptides tagged with
genetically encoded fluorescent markers can be taken up by
coelomocytes, scavenger cells that non-specifically endocytose
and thus concentrate the contents of the coelomic fluid, which
functions as the circulatory system for C. elegans36,37. Thus, the
coelomocyte uptake assay can be used to evaluate the extent to
which a neuropeptide of interest is found in the circulation
(Fig.
3a).
We
simultaneously
expressed
and
integrated
two transgenes in wild-type animals: one bearing the flp-7
gene fused to mCherry and expressed from the ASI neurons
(ASIdaf-7::flp-7mCherry), and the other bearing a GFP-based
marker expressed solely in the coelomocytes (CLM::GFP).
We found that the FLP-7mCherry fusion protein expressed in
the ASI neurons accumulates in the coelomocytes of wild-type
animals. Exogenous 5-HT treatment induced a robust increase in
FLP-7 secretion (B160% of vehicle-treated controls; Fig. 3b–d).
Consistent with the dependence of 5-HT-induced fat loss on
dense core vesicle function (Fig. 1a), unc-31 mutants showed
a profound decrease in FLP-7mCherry accumulation in the
coelomocytes, and subjecting these mutants to 5-HT treatment
had no discernible effect on FLP-7mCherry secretion (Fig. 3b–d).
Thus, FLP-7mCherry accumulation in the coelomocytes is
dependent
on
dense
core
vesicle
release
from
neurons.
We
incidentally
observed
an
accumulation
of
un-secreted
FLP-7mCherry protein in the ASI neurons of unc-31 mutants
(not shown).
Several measures were employed to ensure that the observed
coelomocyte uptake of FLP-7mCherry was a true consequence of
FLP-7 secretion. First, we observed no changes in the expression
levels of the flp-7mCherry mRNA following 5-HT treatment, or in
the mutants in which endogenous 5-HT levels are altered: tph-1
(no 5-HT synthesis) and mod-5 (no 5-HT reuptake; increased
synaptic 5-HT; Supplementary Fig. 3a). Because we use the daf-7
ASI promoter to express the flp-7mCherry transgene, we also
measured endogenous daf-7 mRNA levels. Although tph-1
mutants did have decreased daf-7 mRNA, mod-5 mutants and
exogenous 5-HT treatment did not (Supplementary Fig. 3b).
A daf-7::GFP reporter line also did not show changes in
GFP
fluorescence
upon
5-HT
treatment
(Supplementary
Fig. 3c). The decrease in daf-7 mRNA in tph-1 mutants was not
reflected in the expression level of the flp-7mCherry transgene,
which remained unaltered (Supplementary Fig. 3a). It is possible
that daf-7 mRNA regulation by tph-1 occurs via post-transcrip-
tional effects. Finally, FLP-7 fluorescence intensity in the
ASI neurons also did not change in any of the genotypes or
conditions tested (Supplementary Fig. 3d,e). Thus, the observed
changes in FLP-7mCherry punctae in the coelomocytes cannot
be attributed to differences in flp-7 expression in the ASI neurons.
To independently verify the secretion of FLP-7mCherry from
the ASI neurons we used a different promoter called str-3,
which is not regulated by tph-1 or 5-HT (refs 38,39). An
ASIstr-3::flp-7mCherry transgenic line was generated, and upon
5-HT-treatment
we
again
observed
robust
secretion
of
FLP-7mCherry and accumulation in the coelomocytes (Supple-
mentary Fig. 3f,g). Second, across all experimental conditions
tested (described below), there were no appreciable differences in
GFP expression intensity in the coelomocytes (Fig. 3e). Finally,
for all experimental animals and groups, a correlation plot
of
FLP-7mCherry
and
GFP
expression
intensity
revealed
no observable trend (correlation coefficient 0.15; Fig. 3f).
Thus, mCherry and GFP expression intensity are independent
of one another, and the ratio of FLP-7mCherry punctae
to coelomocyte GFP expression can be used as a reliable indicator
of FLP-7 secretion under different experimental conditions.
We wanted to assess whether FLP-7 secretion is modulated
by
changes
in
endogenous
5-HT
levels
in
neurons.
We
crossed the transgenic FLP-7mCherry secretion lines into tph-1
(tryptophan hydroxylase null) and mod-5 (5-HT reuptake
transporter null) mutant animals, which result in no 5-HT
synthesis and in increased synaptic 5-HT, respectively. tph-1 and
mod-5 are each expressed solely in a few pairs of head neurons
and not in the intestine or in other metabolic tissues. As judged
by the accumulation of FLP-7mCherry punctae in the coelomo-
cytes, tph-1 mutants showed a significant decrease in FLP-7
secretion
(B60%
of
wild-type),
whereas
mod-5
mutants
had substantially increased FLP-7 secretion (B135% of wild-
type; Fig. 3b–d and Supplementary Fig. 3f,g). The alterations in
FLP-7 secretion in both mutants correlate with their correspond-
ing body fat phenotypes: tph-1 mutants have increased body fat,
and mod-5 mutants show a reduction in fat content1,11.
Additionally, as described above, overexpression of flp-7 led to
decreased body fat (Fig. 1d). Together, these experiments show
that FLP-7 secretion from the ASI neurons is responsive to
changes in neuronal 5-HT signalling, and that it drives fat loss in
the intestine.
Circuitry of 5-HT- and OA-induced FLP-7 secretion. We had
previously shown that the serotonergic MOD-1 chloride channel
and the octopaminergic SER-6 GPCR function in an integrated
neuronal circuit to regulate fat loss via an endocrine signal.
To determine the extent to which each of these genes alters FLP-7
secretion properties, we crossed the respective null mutants into
the FLP-7mCherry secretion line. Loss of either mod-1 or
ser-6 did not appreciably decrease FLP-7mCherry secretion under
basal conditions in vehicle-treated animals. However, both
single
mutants
suppressed
the
5-HT-induced
secretion
of
FLP-7mCherry (Fig. 4a,b,d), in keeping with their previously
observed effects on suppression of serotonergic fat loss1. The
suppression of FLP-7mCherry secretion in the mod-1;ser-6
double mutant is also consistent with the previously observed
complete suppression of 5-HT-induced fat loss. To corroborate
the effects of mod-1 and ser-6 on FLP-7mCherry secretion with
changes in body fat content, we generated double mutants
between each of the receptor mutants and the flp-7 peptide
mutant. We found that the mod-1;flp-7 and ser-6;flp-7 mutants
did not show appreciable differences in body fat content
upon vehicle treatment alone (Supplementary Fig. 4), and both
double mutants showed robust suppression of 5-HT-mediated
fat loss, as did the mod-1;ser-6;flp-7 triple mutant (Supplementary
Fig. 4). Together, our results suggest that mod-1 and ser-6 are

 both required for the 5-HT-dependent secretion of FLP-7 and
the ensuing effects on body fat loss.
In previous work we showed that octopamine (OA), the
invertebrate analogue of noradrenaline, stimulates fat loss
via a circuit integrated with 5-HT signalling. OA-induced
fat loss functions via the SER-6 octopaminergic receptor in
the AWB neurons, which in turn maintains tph-1 expression in
ADF neurons1. In addition, ser-6 and tph-1 mutants suppress
the induction of fat loss via exogenous octopamine. We therefore
tested the effects of exogenous OA on FLP-7 secretion in
wild-type, ser-6 and tph-1 animals. Interestingly, flp-7 mutants
suppress OA-induced fat loss (Fig. 5a). Exogenous OA treatment
increased
FLP-7mCherry
secretion
from
the
ASI

and OA-stimulated conditions (Fig. 5b–d). In addition, as
predicted, tph-1 mutants also showed a decrease in OA-induced

ser-6,
mod-1
and
mod-1;ser-6
mutants
suppress
OA-mediated
FLP-7mCherry
secretion to approximately the same extent (Fig. 4a,c,d). Thus,
as seen with 5-HT, the effects of OA on FLP-7mCherry secretion
occur via the integrated effects of SER-6 and MOD-1 signalling.
As described above, the changes in the accumulation and
intensity
of
FLP-7mCherry
in
the
coelomocytes
were
independent of GFP expression intensity in the coelomocytes,
which did not change under these conditions (Fig. 3e,f). Together
with our previous studies describing the site of action of MOD-1
and SER-6, the localization of FLP-7 to the ASI neurons suggests
a circuit in which 5-HT signalling via the ADF and URX sensory
neurons is integrated with OA signalling via the RIC and
AWB neurons to modulate the extent of FLP-7 secretion from the
ASI neurons.
AMPK signalling in the ASI neurons regulates FLP-7 secretion.

 we had observed that loss of aak-2, the C. elegans orthologue of
the AMP kinase a subunit (AMPK) led to a reduction in body fat
stores, to approximately the same extent as 5-HT treatment.
AMPK is an ancient nutrient sensor that is activated by
low cellular energy states (increased AMP:ATP ratio) and by
hormones40. 5-HT is well known to be an indicator of food
presence and increased nutrient availability in C. elegans9;
therefore, it was plausible to consider a role for AMPK in
transducing 5-HT-encoded nutrient information. Evidence from
the literature also suggested that loss of aak-2 mimics increased
5-HT signalling with respect to feeding behaviour41. To evaluate
the possibility that AMPK signalling regulates 5-HT-mediated
FLP-7 secretion, we crossed the flp-7mCherry secretion line
with the aak-2 mutants, and observed a robust increase in
FLP-7mCherry secretion (Fig. 6a–c). This increase in FLP-7
secretion was accompanied by a B60% reduction in body
fat stores in the aak-2 mutants (Fig. 6d). aak-2 cDNA under an
ASI-specific promoter in these mutants significantly restored
body fat levels (Fig. 6d); thus, AAK-2/AMPK signalling from
ASI neurons regulates body fat stores.
Recent
studies
have
identified
a
transcription
factor
called CRTC-1, a co-regulator of the transcription factor
CREB (cAMP response element binding protein), as one
target of AMPK with respect to its role in lifespan control42,43.
Neuronal overexpression of AAK-2/AMPK increases lifespan,
which is dependent upon CRTC-1 repression. At the molecular
level,
AMPK
phosphorylation
of
CTRC-1
results
in
its inactivation; thus, AMPK is a negative regulator of CRTC-1.
Loss of AMPK signalling would therefore be predicted to
de-repress CRTC-1. Interestingly, we found that the increased
secretion of FLP-7mCherry in the aak-2 mutants was suppressed
by crtc-1 removal (Fig. 6a,b), and was restored to levels just
below that of the wild-type. In the aak-2;crtc-1 double mutant,
the
suppression
of
FLP-7
secretion
was
accompanied
by
a full suppression of the reduced body fat seen in the aak-2
single
mutants
(Fig.
6d).
These
data
indicated
that
in

animals,
the presence
of AAK-2/AMPK in the
ASI neurons serves to keep CRTC-1 inactive, thus restrai-
ning FLP-7
secretion and limiting fat loss. We

(Fig.

similar
to
that seen in the aak-2 mutants alone. In wild-type animals,
ASI-specific expression of a constitutively active form of crtc-1
also increased FLP-7mCherry secretion (Fig. 6a,b). Together,
our data suggest that in wild-type ASI neurons, AMPK signalling

metabolism.

During food scarcity, AMPK in ASI neurons would become

 NPR-22/NK2R is the in vivo GPCR for FLP-7. Next, we sought
to identify the receptor through which FLP-7 acts. Two G protein
coupled receptors called neuropeptide receptor-22 (NPR-22)
and
FMRFamide
peptide-like
receptor-3
(FRPR-3)
had
been previously shown to use FLP-7 peptides as ligands
for Gq-mediated activation in HEK293 cells44,45. To obtain
in vivo evidence for a FLP-7 GPCR, we tested npr-22 and
frpr-3 null mutants for suppression of 5-HT-mediated body fat
loss. npr-22 mutants suppressed 5-HT-induced fat loss to
the same extent as flp-7 mutants, whereas frpr-3 mutants
did not, and resembled wild-type animals with respect to body
fat with and without 5-HT (Fig. 7a). A polycistronic GFP reporter
under the control of the npr-22 promoter revealed expression
in a few pairs of head neurons and in the intestine, but not in
other tissues including muscle and hypodermis (Fig. 7b).
We generated transgenic animals in the npr-22 background
by
restoring
npr-22
expression
under
the
control
of
its
own promoter, pan-neuronally, and in the intestine. Relative to
non-transgenic npr-22 mutants, transgenic animals bearing
the endogenous npr-22 promoter fully rescued 5-HT-mediated
fat loss (Fig. 6c). Restoration of npr-22 expression under
a pan-neuronal promoter did not permit 5-HT-mediated fat
loss in transgenic animals. On the other hand, re-expression
of npr-22 selectively in the intestine led to a full rescue of
5-HT-mediated fat loss (Fig. 6c). With respect to 5-HT-induced
fat loss, transgenic animals bearing the rescuing transgene either
under the endogenous npr-22 promoter or under the intestine-
specific promoter were indistinguishable from one another.
In
addition,
npr-22
and
flp-7;npr-22
mutants
both
fully
suppressed the 5-HT-mediated induction of atgl-1 transcription
(Fig. 6d), suggesting that the neuronal 5-HTergic signal for
fat loss is conveyed to the intestine via FLP-7/NPR-22 signalling.
NPR-22 is a C. elegans orthologue of the mammalian
tachykinin/neurokinin 2 receptor (TacR2 or NK2R; Supple-
mentary Fig. 6). The mammalian NK2 receptor is expressed in

 first asked the following questions: to what extent does the
antagonist compound mimic the suppressive effect of fat loss seen
in the npr-22 mutants, and is there an additive effect of NPR-22
and the compound together? As seen in Fig. 7e, in wild-type
animals the fat loss elicited by 5-HT is suppressed nearly two-fold
by pre-treatment with the GR159897 antagonist. npr-22 mutants
suppress 5-HT-induced fat loss to the same extent as GR159897,
and treatment of npr-22 mutants with the compound did not lead
to an additive effect on the suppression (Fig. 7e), suggesting that
the NK2R antagonist does not function via an independent
receptor. Next, in the flp-7 overexpression line (which drives fat
loss via atgl-1; Fig. 1d), we found that both npr-22 removal and
NK2R antagonist treatment fully suppress the fat loss induced by
increased FLP-7 signalling (Fig. 7e). These experiments show that
the loss of the NPR-22 GPCR and the mammalian NK2R
antagonist can interchangeably block the effects of 5-HT
signalling and FLP-7 overexpression on fat loss in the intestine.
In vivo ligand-receptor necessity and sufficiency. The relation-
ship between the FLP-7 ligand and the NPR-22 receptor had been
shown in cultured HEK293 cells44. To test ligand-receptor
necessity and sufficiency in vivo, we asked the following
question: in the context of a flp-7;npr-22 double mutant, would
either the ligand alone or the receptor alone suffice to restore
5-HTergic fat loss? We reasoned that if FLP-7 and NPR-22 are
a true ligand-receptor pair in vivo, neither gene could rescue the
double mutant without the presence of the other. We crossed the
neuronal flp-7 transgenic rescue line with the intestinal npr-22
rescue line. Because C. elegans transgenes are carried as
extrachromosomal
arrays,
we
simultaneously
isolated
flp-7;npr-22 double mutants and those bearing either the flp-7
transgene alone, the npr-22 transgene alone, or both. First, we
found that flp-7;npr-22 double mutants suppressed 5-HT-induced
fat loss to the same extent as either single mutant alone with no
additive effects, suggesting that they function in a single linear
pathway (Fig. 8a). Next, in the flp-7;npr-22 mutant background,
re-expression of either the flp-7 transgene alone or the npr-22
transgene in the intestine did not allow 5-HT-induced fat loss
(Fig. 8a). In contrast, double mutants in which both the flp-7 and
npr-22 transgenes were re-expressed in their respective locations
(ASI neurons and intestine, respectively) showed a complete
restoration of 5-HT-induced fat loss (Fig. 8a). Thus, we conclude
that the FLP-7 ligand and the NPR-22 receptor function as a true
ligand-receptor pair in vivo, and define the neuroendocrine axis
that couples nutrient information via 5-HT signalling in the
nervous system, with fat loss in the periphery.
Discussion
Here, we present the identification of a secreted neuroendocrine
peptide called FLP-7 and its cognate in vivo GPCR NPR-22, the

nervous system, an integrated 5-HT and octopaminergic circuit stimulates body fat loss. In this study, we report the discovery of a tachykinin signalling
system that underlies the 5-HTergic control of body fat loss in C. elegans. The FLP-7 neuroendocrine peptide is secreted from the ASI neurons in response to
5-HTand Oct-mediated signalling. The nutrient sensor AAK-2/AMPK acts in the ASI neurons via the CREB co-regulator CRTC-1 to regulate FLP-7 release in
response to 5-HT-encoded signals of food availability. Upon release, FLP-7 acts in the intestine via the NPR-22/NK2R receptor to stimulate the ATGL-1
lipase, which drives fat loss. The identification of FLP-7 and NPR-22 addresses a long-standing question about the molecular basis of the central effects of
5-HT on fat loss in peripheral tissues.

 ancestral orthologues of the tachykinin/neurokinin signalling
system, as the neuroendocrine signalling axis that connects the
5-HT circuit from the nervous system, to its metabolic actions
in the intestine. FLP-7 and NPR-22 function together as a ligand-
receptor pair and define a conserved signalling pathway with
an unexpected role in fat metabolism. We show that the
FLP-7 peptide is secreted from neurons, and acts in the intestine
via the tachykinin 2 receptor orthologue NPR-22 to mobilize fat
stores (Fig. 8b). We find that FLP-7 is a potent and selective
stimulator of body fat loss without altering 5-HT-dependent
changes in food intake, locomotion or reproduction. Our studies
presented here uncover a previously undefined neuroendocrine
signalling pathway that preferentially stimulates body fat loss.
We hypothesize that for global neuromodulators of physiology
and behaviour such as 5-HT, one mechanism by which
phenotypic selectivity is achieved is to deploy distinct neuropep-
tides for each phenotypic output. Thus, identification of selective
regulators for distinct physiological outputs represents a path
forward to uncover novel and potent neuroendocrine regulators
of physiology.
Our identification of the ASI sensory neurons as the source
of FLP-7 secretion is tantalizing. Several lines of evidence indicate
a role for these neurons as gatekeepers of communication
from the sensory nervous system to the metabolic organs of the
body. In this regard, these neurons resemble the mammalian
hypothalamus-brainstem
complex.
First,
the
ASI
neurons
are known to regulate both lifespan and dauer formation33,34,47,
an alternate physiological state that is triggered by unfavourable
environmental conditions during development. Second, at least
two distinct neuropeptides are already known to be secreted
from ASI neurons: the TGFb ligand DAF-7 (ref. 48), and the
insulin DAF-28 (ref. 35). Although these neuropeptides do not
have roles in 5-HTergic fat loss, they are nonetheless regulators of
global physiological state. Third, ASI neurons regulate locomotor
and feeding behaviours in response to food availability and
pheromones49–51. Finally, ER stress-induced unfolded protein
response and innate immunity pathways are activated in
ASI neurons to promote dauer diapause52,53. The demon-
stration of a role for FLP-7 secretion from the ASI neurons
in response to 5-HT signalling and the nutrient sensor AMPK
suggests that these neurons integrate nutrient information
to regulate multiple physiological outputs. We propose a model
in which nutrient information from the environment regulates
fat metabolism via this neuroendocrine pathway (Fig. 8b).
Nutrient replete conditions that evoke increased neuronal
5-HT keep AAK-2/AMPK inactive in the ASI neurons, which
de-represses CRTC-1, thus stimulating FLP-7 secretion and
promoting fat loss via NPR-22 in the intestine (Fig. 8b). On the
other hand, nutrient depletion activates AAK-2/AMPK signalling
in the ASI neurons, represses CRTC-1, resulting in reduced FLP-7
secretion. Thus, fat loss is halted in the face of decreased food
availability (Fig. 8b). One implication of our results is that
limiting rapid fat loss and mitochondrial beta oxidation via
modulation of FLP-7 secretion may be the principal mechanism
underlying the increased lifespan of AMPK overexpression43.
A major future challenge would be to decipher the relationship
between
nutrient
sensing
in
the
nervous
system,
and
the mechanisms
governing
the
secretion of
each
distinct
neuropeptide from the ASI neurons to elicit context-dependent
responses that sculpt the physiological response to metabolic and
lifespan control.
Of the many neuropeptide genes encoded by the C. elegans
genome, FLP-7 emerged as the predominant suppressor of
5-HT-mediated fat loss. The tachykinin family of peptides was
discovered over 80 years ago with the extraction and isolation of
its founding member Substance P, from horse intestine and
brain54. It is now known that the mammalian tachykinins
are
excitatory
neuropeptides
found
predominantly
in
the
hypothalamus and in the primary sensory neurons of the
enteric nervous system and in the dorsal root, trigeminal and
vagal
ganglia
that
innervate
the
gastrointestinal
tract29,55.
The
tachykinin
‘brain-gut’
peptides
have
many
roles
in
mammalian physiology including gut motility, but have been
studied primarily with respect to their roles in nociception
and inflammation56–58. In mammals there are three tachykinin
receptors (all GPCRs), called NK1R-NK3R (refs 59–61). NK1R
is
the
best-studied
receptor,
is
widely
expressed,
and
NK1R antagonists are in clinical use as anti-emetics62,63. NK2R,
the orthologue of the C. elegans NPR-22 identified in this study, is
perhaps the most under-studied tachykinin receptor. It is
expressed in several metabolic tissues in mice and humans
including
the
intestine,
pancreas,
liver
and
kidney
(www.biogps.org). To our knowledge, NK2R has not previously
been associated with changes in adiposity or energy balance in
mammals. It will be interesting to determine the extent to which
central 5-HT action leads to stimulation and release of the
tachykinin peptides from specific primary sensory neuron
populations
in
other
systems.
In
C.
elegans,
another
neuropeptide
called
FLP-18
also
regulates
behaviour
and
metabolism through two GPCRs, NPR-4 and NPR-5. Unlike
FLP-7, FLP-18 has broad roles in coordinating behaviour
and metabolism across many tissues, suggesting a complex
regulatory landscape for neuropeptide biology64.
Other than the requirement for UNC-31/CAPS, the mechan-
isms of neuropeptide release have remained unknown, in any
species. As in the case of the regulated release of synaptic
vesicles65, it is likely that there are many additional factors
regulating the release of dense core vesicles. Identifying such
regulators has the potential to reveal insights into many aspects
of
neuromodulation
and
neuroendocrine
biology.
Finally,
despite recent strides in functionally characterizing the roles
of
neuropeptides
in
behaviour24,66,67,
the
great
majority
of neuropeptides in metazoan genomes remain unannotated.
We suggest that the many non-cell-autonomous physiological
effects
described
in
the
C.
elegans
literature
stem
from
neuropeptides that function as endocrine factors68–71. The
approach presented here could be one useful strategy to
uncover novel facets of neuroendocrine biology.
Methods
Animal maintenance and strains. Nematodes were cultured on OP50 bacterial
lawns on nematode growth medium (NGM) plates at 20 �C (ref. 72). N2 Bristol,
obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetic Center (CGC), was used as the wild-type
reference strain. The strains used in the study are given in Supplementary Table 1.
The list of neuropeptide mutants screened is available on request. With the
exception of behavioural assays, all animals were synchronized by hypochlorite
treatment, after which hatched L1 larvae were seeded on OP50 plates. All
experiments were performed on day 1 adults.
5-HT OA and GR159897 treatments. 5-HT hydrochloride powder (Sigma) and
octopamine hydrochloride (OA; Sigma) were dissolved in 0.1 M HCl. Both
5-HT and OA were freshly added to plates, and used at a final concentration
of 5 mM (ref. 1). GR159897 (Tocris) was used at the final concentrations
of 0.04, 0.016 and 0.008 mM in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. The doses were chosen
after ensuring that there were no developmental delays, or other overt effects
on growth.
Oil Red O staining. Nematodes were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Animals were fixed in 60% isopropanol
on a rotating rack for 20 min. Following this step, animals were incubated
overnight with a filtered oil Red O working solution (60% oil Red O in
isopropanol: 40% water) and protected from light. Within a single experiment,
approximately 2,000 animals were fixed and stained. Within each experiment,
B100 animals were visually inspected on slides, following which 15–20 animals

 were imaged for each genotype/condition. All experiments were repeated at least
three times.
Image acquisition and quantitation. Black and white images of oil Red O stained
animals and fluorescent images were captured using a � 10 objective on
a Zeiss Axio Imager microscope. In all cases, lipid droplet staining in the first four
pairs of intestinal cells was quantified using NIH Image J software, by measuring
pixel intensity over the first four pairs of intestinal cells, which fully encapsulate the
variation seen in the tested conditions1. For all atgl-1::GFP images, fluorescence
intensity in the second and third pairs of intestinal cells was quantified. Fluorescent
images of the reporters for FLP-7 secretion were captured using a � 20 objective
on a Zeiss Axio Imager microscope. For all ‘secretion line’ animals, the first pair of
coelomocytes was imaged. mCherry fluorescence intensity in one of the two
imaged coelomocytes was quantified and normalized to the surface area of the
coelomocyte. Within each experiment, approximately 15–20 animals from each
condition were quantified. All images were quantified using ImageJ (NIH).
Cloning and transgenic construction. Promoters and genes were cloned using
standard PCR techniques from N2 Bristol lysates, using Gateway Technology
(Life Technologies). Promoter lengths were determined based on functional rescue
and are available on request. All rescue plasmids were generated using polycistronic
GFP. Transgenic rescue strains were constructed by microinjection into the
C. elegans germline followed by visual selection of transgenic animals under
fluorescence. For the microinjections, 5–10 ng ml � 1 of the desired plasmid
was injected with 25 ng ml � 1 of an unc-122::GFP co-injection marker and
65–70 ng ml � 1 of an empty vector to maintain a total injection mix concentration
of 100 ng ml � 1. In each case, 10–20 stable transgenic lines were generated. Two
lines were selected for experimentation based on consistency of expression
and transmission rate. The FLP-7 secretion lines were generated with plasmid
containing a flp-7::mCherry fusion construct under the control of the daf-7 and
str-3 promoters.
Quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitro-
gen). Genomic DNA was removed using an RNase-free DNase kit (QIAGEN).
cDNA was prepared using a iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix for RT-qPCR
kit (BioRad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative PCR was
performed using the SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Data were normalized to actin mRNA. Primer
sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 2.
DiI staining. Animals of mixed developmental stages were incubated in
a 1:200 dilution of DiI stain (Life Technologies) overnight on a rotating rack.
After staining, the animals were seeded onto a plate containing an OP50 bacterial
lawn and allowed to dry for approximately 30 min. Fluorescent images of animals
in the L2-L3 larval stages were captured using a � 100 objective on a Zeiss Axio
Imager microscope.
Food intake. Food intake was measured using feeding rate11. For each animal, the
rhythmic contractions of the pharyngeal bulb were counted over a 10 s period
under a Zeiss M2 Bio Discovery microscope. For each genotype, ten animals were
counted per condition and the experiment was repeated at least three times.
Egg-laying assay. Animals were treated with 5 mM 5-HT or vehicle for 46 h at
20 �C. For each condition, five animals were then transferred onto 3.5 cm plates
containing 5-HT or vehicle, respectively. For each condition, a total of ten plates
were assayed. After 3 h the animals were removed from the experimental plates and
the number of eggs on the plate was counted. Data are presented as the average
number of eggs laid per hour.
Enhanced slowing response. The enhanced slowing response was assayed as
described6. Day 1 adult animals were washed off food plates with PBS, washed five
times to remove food and placed on NGM agar plates without food. After a 30-min
fast, animals were collected in PBS and seeded onto NGM plates with HB101.
Animals were allowed to acclimatize for 5 min, after which the number of body
bends/20 s was counted.
Statistics. Wild-type animals were included as controls for every experiment.
Error bars represent s.e.m. Student’s t-test, one-way ANOVA and two-way
ANOVA were used as indicated in the figure legends.
Data availability. The authors confirm that all relevant data are included in the
paper and/or its supplementary information files, or can be obtained from the
author on reasonable request.
