Summary
Background Global inequalities in access to health care are reflected in differences in cancer survival. The CONCORD 
programme was designed to assess worldwide differences and trends in population-based cancer survival. In this 
population-based study, we aimed to estimate survival inequalities globally for several subtypes of childhood leukaemia.
Methods Cancer registries participating in CONCORD were asked to submit tumour registrations for all children aged 
0–14 years who were diagnosed with leukaemia between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2009, and followed up until 
Dec 31, 2009. Haematological malignancies were defined by morphology codes in the International Classification of 
Diseases for Oncology, third revision. We excluded data from registries from which the data were judged to be less 
reliable, or included only lymphomas, and data from countries in which data for fewer than ten children were available 
for analysis. We also excluded records because of a missing date of birth, diagnosis, or last known vital status. We 
estimated 5-year net survival (ie, the probability of surviving at least 5 years after diagnosis, after controlling for deaths 
from other causes [background mortality]) for children by calendar period of diagnosis (1995–99, 2000–04, and 
2005–09), sex, and age at diagnosis (<1, 1–4, 5–9, and 10–14 years, inclusive) using appropriate life tables. We estimated 
age-standardised net survival for international comparison of survival trends for precursor-cell acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). 
Findings We analysed data from 89 828 children from 198 registries in 53 countries. During 1995–99, 5-year age-
standardised net survival for all lymphoid leukaemias combined ranged from 10·6% (95% CI 3·1–18·2) in the 
Chinese registries to 86·8% (81·6–92·0) in Austria. International differences in 5-year survival for childhood 
leukaemia were still large as recently as 2005–09, when age-standardised survival for lymphoid leukaemias ranged 
from 52·4% (95% CI 42·8–61·9) in Cali, Colombia, to 91·6% (89·5–93·6) in the German registries, and for AML 
ranged from 33·3% (18·9–47·7) in Bulgaria to 78·2% (72·0–84·3) in German registries. Survival from precursor-cell 
ALL was very close to that of all lymphoid leukaemias combined, with similar variation. In most countries, survival 
from AML improved more than survival from ALL between 2000–04 and 2005–09. Survival for each type of leukaemia 
varied markedly with age: survival was highest for children aged 1–4 and 5–9 years, and lowest for infants (younger 
than 1 year). There was no systematic difference in survival between boys and girls.
Interpretation Global inequalities in survival from childhood leukaemia have narrowed with time but remain very 
wide for both ALL and AML. These results provide useful information for health policy makers on the effectiveness 
of health-care systems and for cancer policy makers to reduce inequalities in childhood cancer survival.

Introduction
Worldwide inequalities in health and health care are 
reflected in global differences in life expectancy and 
overall mortality in both adults and children,1 and the 
findings from several studies have highlighted global 
differences in cancer incidence2 and survival.3,4 Diagnostic 
techniques and treatment for childhood leukaemia have 
improved since the 1990s. Access to these techniques 
and treatment has, however, been limited in some 
countries, partly by a shortage of resources.5 
Leukaemias, a heterogeneous group of diseases of 
mostly unknown origin, are globally the most common 
malignancies in children (aged 0–14 years), except in 
Africa.6 Unlike in adults, acute lymphoid leukaemias are

the commonest subtype in children (accounting for 
approximately 80% of cases), and acute myeloid 
leukaemia (AML) represents about 15% of cases. For 
both types, incidence varies widely with age; in lymphoid 
leukaemias, incidence is slightly higher in boys than 
girls, and in industrialised high-income countries 
(HIC).7 In low-income and middle-income countries 
(LMIC), where the population is young, the incidence of 
childhood leukaemias is lower than in HIC, but these 
diseases are still responsible for many deaths.2,5
Although cancer mortality trends provide a useful 
measure of the societal cancer burden, they depend on 
trends in both incidence and survival. Cancer survival is 
the probability that cancer patients survive up to a 
certain point after diagnosis. Observed survival and 
event-free survival are clinically important, but 
population-based net survival is the appropriate 
indicator for comparisons between populations. Net 
survival is the probability of surviving after controlling 
for mortality from other causes. 
The CONCORD programme was designed to address 
the shortage of globally comparable data on population-
based cancer survival.3,4 Population-based cancer survival 
reflects several aspects of health care, from screening and 
early diagnosis, to access to effective treatment. This 
metric is increasingly used as a measure of the 
effectiveness of health-care systems in the management 
of cancer, and to assess the effectiveness of national cancer 
plans.8,9 The second cycle of CONCORD (CONCORD-2)4 
established global surveillance of population-based cancer 
survival for patients diagnosed with one of ten common 
cancers, or childhood leukaemia, during the 15-year 
period 1995–2009, using data from 279 population-based 
cancer registries in 67 countries. In this analysis, we 
examine worldwide trends in survival from precursor-cell 
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in children, by age 
and sex, alongside trends in survival from acute myeloid 
leukaemia (AML) and other types of childhood leukaemia.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
Cancer registries participating in CONCORD-2 were 
asked to submit tumour registrations for all children 
(aged 0–14 years) diagnosed with a haematological 
malignancy between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2009, 
including information about their vital status at 
Dec 31, 2009.4 Depending on the registry, patients were 
followed up actively, via direct investigation, or passively, 
using linkage to national or regional databases of death.4 
Haematological 
malignancies 
were 
defined 
by 
morphology codes in the range 9590–9989 in the 
International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 
third revision (ICD-O-3).10 215 registries in 60 countries 
submitted data on 126 830 children with a haematological 
malignancy. We excluded data from 13 registries from 
which the data were judged to be less reliable,4 or 
included only lymphomas (two), and data from countries 
for which fewer than 10 children were available for 
analysis (two). This left 124 015 records for children with 
a haematological malignancy.
We did standardised data cleaning in three phases, as 
detailed previously.4 Records that were ineligible (eg, for 
patients aged 15 years or older), inaccurate or inappropriate 
for survival analysis (eg, incoherent date sequence, or 
registration only from a death certificate or autopsy report) 
were excluded.4,11 For patients with more than one record 
of a haematological malignancy diagnosed during 
1995–2009, we kept only the record of the first malignancy. 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
In 2015, the CONCORD-2 study initiated  surveillance of survival 
trends for childhood leukaemia at a worldwide scale. Results 
from CONCORD-2 identified huge worldwide variation in 5-year 
net survival for children diagnosed with precursor-cell acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia or lymphoma (ALL) during 
1995-2009. Our analysis extends those results to cover survival 
trends for several subtypes of childhood leukaemia, grouped 
according to the third edition of the International Classification 
of Childhood Cancer.
Added value of this study
We included 89 828 children diagnosed with leukaemia during 
1995–2009 in 53 countries. Despite substantial improvements 
in survival from childhood acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in 
most countries during 1995–2009, huge international disparities 
in 5-year survival persisted up to 2009, matching those 
previously reported in the 2015 CONCORD-2 paper for childhood 
ALL. 5-year age-standardised net survival from AML (ie, the 
probability of surviving at least 5 years after diagnosis) was 
consistently lower than 5-year age-standardised net survival 
from ALL, but the difference narrowed in most countries since 
the early 2000s. Children aged 1–9 years at diagnosis had higher 
5-year net survival than older or younger children, both for ALL 
and AML. Survival for older children (10–14 years) improved by 
2009, but infants (aged <1 year) diagnosed with either ALL or 
AML still had the lowest 5-year net survival.
Implications of all the available evidence
Data obtained in the CONCORD programme provide a unique 
opportunity to explore disparities in survival from childhood 
leukaemia at an unprecedented scale. The results suggest that 
good access to health care and appropriate treatment have a 
clear population effect on survival for children with leukaemia. 
The findings support the need for continuing international 
efforts to improve worldwide access to appropriate cancer care 
for children. They can also be used to assess the effect of cancer 
strategies targeting childhood cancers.

A few registries submitted records coded to earlier 
revisions of ICD-O or to the first revision of ICD-O-3. In 
agreement with these registries, we recoded those 
morphology codes to be compliant with ICD-O-3. Data 
from Sétif (Algeria), Arkhangelsk (Russia), Wrocław 
(Poland), and Northern Ireland (UK) were included after 
their data were recoded to ICD-O-3.
Data analysis
We estimated 5-year net survival with the Pohar-Perme 
estimator12 using the STNS command implemented in 
Stata 13. We used the life tables of background mortality 
rates by sex, single year of age, calendar year and—for USA, 
Israel, Malaysia, and New Zealand—by race or ethnic 
group, produced for CONCORD-2.13 For each country, we 
estimated net survival by calendar period of diagnosis 
(1995–99, 2000–04, and 2005–09). We used the classic 
cohort approach for children diagnosed during 1995–99 and 
2000–04, because 5 years of follow-up data were available for 
all children. We used the period approach to predict 5-year 
survival for leukaemias diagnosed more recently (2005–09), 
as this approach allows for the prediction of survival where 
5 years of follow-up are not yet available.14 
Survival estimates for each country were based on data 
from a national registry or from one or several 
subnational registries. We excluded data from some 
regional registries from the pooled estimate for a given 
country if data quality or information about vital status 
were deemed unsatisfactory.4 Country estimates were 
flagged if data quality was considered less reliable. 
We estimated 5-year survival by sex and age at diagnosis 
(<1, 1–4, 5–9, 10–14 years, inclusive). Exact age at diagnosis 
was calculated from the dates of birth and diagnosis. The 
rules adopted to impute missing components of dates 
have been described previously.4,11 Age-standardised 
survival was calculated from three equally weighted age-
specific estimates (0–4, 5–9, and 10–14 years).15 Data for 
age groups with fewer than ten patients were pooled with 
data for the adjacent age group; we then re-estimated 
survival for both age groups combined, and the pooled 
estimate was attributed to each age group.
Leukaemias 
were 
grouped 
according 
to 
the 
International 
Classification 
of 
Childhood 
Cancer 
(ICCC-3).16 We estimated survival for all lymphoid 
leukaemias combined (ICCC-3 group Ia), for acute 
myeloid leukaemias (AML; Ib), and for unspecified and 
other specified leukaemias (Ie) (appendix p 5). We also 
estimated survival separately for two subgroups of 
lymphoid leukaemia: precursor-cell lymphoid leukaemias 
(ALL; Ia1) and mature B-cell leukaemias (Ia2). We did not 
analyse survival for chronic myeloproliferative diseases 
(group Ic) or myelodysplastic syndrome and other 
myeloproliferative diseases (group Id). 
Ethical approval for access to the data was obtained 
from the Ethics and Confidentiality Committee of the 
UK’s statutory National Information Governance Board 
(now the Health Research Authority; ECC 3-04(i)/2011) 
and the UK National Health Service (NHS) Research 
Ethics Service (South-East; 11/LO/0331), and from other 
jurisdictions as required.4

The corresponding author had full access to all data in 
the study and had final responsibility for the decision to 
submit for publication.
Results
Of the 124 015 children who were considered for 
analysis, we excluded 1623 (1%) as ineligible, usually 
because of missing information on date of birth, 
diagnosis, or last known vital status (table 1). More than 
75% of records from the Tunisia Central Registry were 
ineligible because of incomplete data. Overall, only 
0·5% of records were excluded because the registration 
was based solely on a death certificate or an autopsy 
report. We excluded five patients with synchronous 
leukaemia and lymphoma, and 106 children whose 
leukaemia followed a lymphoma, also diagnosed during 
1995–2009. We also excluded 2222 children with chronic 
myeloproliferative disease (ICCC-3 group Ic) and 
2002 children with myelodysplastic syndrome or other 
myeloproliferative disease (Id). Lymphomas (27 609) 
were not included.

Data quality was generally very high, and a high 
proportion of diagnoses were reported with a specific 
morphology. Improvements in diagnosis and registration 
are illustrated in Latvia by the drop in the number of 
unspecified and other specified leukaemias (group Ie) 
between 1995–99 and 2005–09. 
We focused our analyses on 89 828 children (73·8% of 
all haematological malignancies) from 198 registries in 
53 countries who were diagnosed with lymphoid 
leukaemia (ICCC-3 group Ia), acute myeloid leukaemia 
(Ib), or unspecified or other specified leukaemia (Ie). 
For children diagnosed during 1995–2004 who were 
not known to have died, the median follow-up was at 
least 5 years in all participating countries in North, 
Central, and South America, Europe, Asia, and Oceania. 
In Africa, the median follow-up of surviving children 
diagnosed up to 2004 was 0·7 years (IQR 0·2–3·0) in 
the two Algerian registries and 1·7 years (1·0–2·2) in 
the Tunisia Central Registry, although the maximum 
follow-up was 8·9 and 13·3 years, respectively.
All lymphoid leukaemias combined represented 81% of 
leukaemias, AML 16%, and unspecified and other 
specified leukaemias the remaining 3% (table 1). In 
Lesotho, no AML was registered during 1995–2009. 
Information from the cancer registries in Belarus, 
Argentina, and Colombia (Cali) was only available for 
lymphoid leukaemias. Precursor-cell ALL was by far the 
most common type of lymphoid leukaemia, but some 
registries submitted data on rarer types, such as mature 
B-cell (mostly Burkitt leukaemia), mature T and Natural-
Killer (NK) cell leukaemias (figure 1). Due to the rarity of 
mature T-cell and NK-cell leukaemia (n=94, ICCC-3 
group Ia3) and unspecified lymphoid leukaemias (n=446, 
Ia4), we did not estimate survival separately for these 
morphological groups. In the data from Indonesia 
(Jakarta), 17 Chinese registries, and Latvia, more than 25%

of the childhood leukaemias were coded as unspecified or 
other specified leukaemia (ICCC-3 group Ie).
During 1995–99, 5-year age-standardised net survival 
for all lymphoid leukaemias combined ranged from 
10·6% (95% CI 3·1–18·2) in the Chinese registries to 
86·8% (81·6–92·0) in Austria (table 2). This wide range 
in survival narrowed over time, with survival in 2005–09 
ranging from 52·4% (42·8–61·9) in Cali, Colombia, to 
91·6% (89·5–93·6) in the German registries. Survival 
from precursor-cell ALL was very close to that of all 
lymphoid leukaemias combined, with similar variation 
(figure 2). The greatest absolute difference in survival 
between all lymphoid leukaemias and ALL was noted in 
Iceland (80·9% and 90·1%, respectively) but these 
estimates were not age-standardised because of small 
numbers. Survival from precursor-cell ALL increased 
between 1995–99 and 2005–09 in most countries 
(figure 3).

We estimated survival for mature B-cell leukaemia for 
17 countries. Many of these estimates were based on a 
pooled analysis for children diagnosed throughout 
1995–2009, because the number of patients diagnosed in 
each 5-year period was small. In France and the US 
registries, 5-year age-standardised net survival from mature 
B-cell leukaemia was lower than that of precursor-cell ALL 
in 1995–99, but the difference had disappeared by 2005–09.
5-year age-standardised net survival for AML was 
consistently lower than that for ALL (table 2, figure 2). 
Age-standardised survival for AML in 1995–99 ranged 
from 4·2% (0·0–8·6) in the Chinese registries to 72·2% 
(61·6–82·7) in Sweden, and from 33·3% (18·9–47·7) in 
Bulgaria to 78·2% (72·0–84·3) in German registries for 
2005–09. In most countries, survival from childhood 
AML increased quite remarkably over time (figure 3). 
Age-standardised 5-year survival for unspecified and 
other specified leukaemia (group Ie) showed wide 
variation, ranging from 13·5% (Bulgaria) to 69·6% 
(Latvia) in 1995–99, and from 26·0% (Chinese registries) 
to 89·2% (Israel) in 2005–09. 
Survival from ALL in infants (aged <1 year) was much 
lower than for older children, including those aged 
10–14 years (appendix pp 6–14). By contrast, survival for 
infants with AML in many countries was close to that for 
children aged 10–14 years (appendix pp 15–22). Children 
aged 1–4 and 5–9 years had the highest survival for both 
ALL and AML. The difference in survival between 
children with ALL aged 10–14 and those aged 1–4 and 
5–9 years fell progressively between 1995–99 and 2005–09 
in most countries. The pattern was not so clear for AML. 
Survival from AML and ALL was often slightly higher for 
girls than for boys, but this pattern was not consistent 
across all countries (appendix pp 6–22).
Survival trends for precursor-cell ALL and AML were 
not markedly different between 1995–99 and 2000–04 
(figure 4); however, between 2000–04 and 2005–09, 
survival from AML increased more than survival from 
ALL in most countries (figure 4B), particularly in 
Thailand and Switzerland.
Discussion
This study provides the largest population-based 
comparison of survival from childhood leukaemia. It 
covers trends over 15 years between 1995–2009 in 
53 countries, of which 17 were classified by the World 
Bank as low-income or middle-income countries (LMIC) 
in 2011. The results highlight the very wide international 
differences in 5-year net survival for children with acute 
lymphoid leukaemia and for children with myeloid 
leukaemia. 5-year net survival has been increasing for 
both precursor-cell ALL and AML, but it remains 
consistently higher for precursor-cell ALL than for AML; 
this worldwide pattern is consistent with previous studies 
in various regions of the world.7,17–20 For many LMICs, 
analyses and interpretation are limited by sparse data. 
Several survival estimates could not be age-standardised. 
However, our results show that, overall, survival has been 
increasing for ALL and for AML in most countries during 
1995–2009, including both high-income and LMICs.

5-year survival for both ALL and AML was very high in 
Germany and Austria. This might be attributable to the 
very tight adherence of paediatric haematologists and 
oncologists in those countries to the protocols and trials 
of the BFM Group (Berlin, Frankfurt, Muenster), within 
the framework of a national paediatric cancer registry 
and reference laboratories, imaging review and tumour 
boards.21 
In most countries, the difference in survival between 
ALL and AML tended to narrow over the period 1995–2009. 
This happened both in countries where survival from ALL 
was very high throughout 1995–2009, and in countries 
where survival from ALL was low in 1995–99, but increased 
up to 2005–09. The greater improvement in 5-year survival 
from AML than from ALL might be related to recent 
improvements in the care of childhood AML. Our results 
might reflect the effect of better diagnostic characterisation, 
risk stratification and subsequent adaptation of treatment, 
and restriction of indications to cranial radiotherapy and 
haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation.22 
Net survival from AML seemed to approach the level of 
survival from precursor-cell ALL earlier in some countries 
than in others. This suggests that improvements in 
clinical practice have not been implemented in all 
countries at the same time. In Switzerland, there was a 
large increase in survival from AML between 1995–2004 
and 2005–09, by which time it approached the level of 
survival from ALL. In Thailand, national protocols were 
introduced for childhood leukaemia in 2006. This may 
have contributed to the marked improvement in survival 
from AML, but did not lead to substantial improvements 
in survival for ALL.23 In China, despite the impressive 
increases in survival from AML and ALL throughout 
1995–2009, there was no reduction in the difference in 
survival between ALL and AML.
This large study offered a unique opportunity to examine 
age-standardised trends in population-based survival from 
some of the rarer childhood leukaemias, such as mature 
B-cell leukaemias, mostly Burkitt’s leukaemia. In France 
and the USA, where survival from mature B-cell leukaemia 
could be age-standardised, the most recent estimates 
showed that survival from mature B-cell leukaemia was 
close to that of precursor-cell ALL. A degree of 
misclassification between precursor-cell ALL and Burkitt’s 
leukaemia is likely because of their common historical 
classification and the remaining ambiguity in coding, but 
this is unlikely to explain the increasing survival trends for 
mature B-cell leukaemia in France and the USA.
Leukaemia survival has been reported as higher in girls 
than in boys, both in Europe from 1970 up to the 1990s,24 
and still recently in North America,18 but this is not a 
consistent feature worldwide. 
As expected, age at diagnosis was an important 
determinant of 5-year survival: children diagnosed with 
precursor-cell ALL aged 1–4 years consistently had the 
best prognosis. Survival from leukaemia in infants 
(under 1 year) was usually lower than at older ages. 
Survival was lower for infants with precursor-cell ALL 
than for infants with AML. This might be because 
unfavourable prognostic factors such as MLL gene 
rearrangements are more frequent in infants with ALL 
than AML. The new coding rules to individualise ALLs 
and AMLs with specific genetic rearrangements should 
enable analysis of more specific subgroups in the future.25
Interpretation might be restricted by changes in the 
clinical definition of leukaemias and lymphomas over 
time, and differences in coding between registries. The 
classifications for grouping the types of leukaemia and 
lymphoma have also changed over decades. ICCC-3 
was proposed in 2005,16 and, in 2010, the HAEMACARE 
Working 
Group 
proposed 
a 
classification 
for 
haematological malignancies in both adults and 
children.26 Results shown here were based on ICCC-3, 
which is commonly used for childhood cancer 
surveillance.7,17 Using the HAEMACARE classification, 
we noted similar results for precursor-cell ALL and 
AML, but some differences for Burkitt’s leukaemia, 
probably due to the broader grouping defined by 
HAEMACARE (data not shown). We did not have data 
to show the effect on survival estimates of including 
endemic Burkitt’s lymphoma in Africa in that group. 
Children are more likely to be diagnosed and registered 
with a poorly specified type of leukaemia in settings 
where access to a pathologist is less than optimal. This 
could have clinical implications, with children not gaining 
access to the most appropriate treatment for their 
particular leukaemia.27 Where the estimates for this 
poorly specified group of leukaemias could be age-
standardised, they indicate that in high-income countries, 
survival was between that of precursor-cell ALL and AML. 
For the Chinese registries, where the proportion of 
unspecified and other specified leukaemias remained 
higher than 25% throughout 1995–2009, survival for 
those leukaemias was lower than that for AML. This 
suggests uncertain diagnosis and insufficient or 
inappropriate treatment. Implementation of the recent 
resource-stratified guidelines for the management of 
childhood ALL in Asia should lead to better diagnostic 
characterisation, more appropriate treatment and higher 
survival.28 In Colombia, the low survival estimate for 
lymphoid leukaemia (52%) suggests the need for further 
investigation, since childhood cancer became a national 
priority in 2010.
Leukaemia is the most common malignancy in children 
in most countries,6 and we used population-based data, but 
comparisons of survival by age and type of leukaemia were 
sometimes limited by low numbers, especially in small 
populations. Some age-standardised survival estimates 
have wide CIs. This was particularly true for AML and 
mature B-cell leukaemia, and for all types of leukaemia in 
infants. Survival estimates for Tunisian and Algerian 
registries were less reliable than for other countries. We 
used the age range 0–14 years for our analysis because this 
range has been the standard in childhood cancer studies

for many years. Adolescents and young adults are 
increasingly being treated under paediatric protocols, but 
our choice was agreed with 100 collaborators during a 
2-day meeting of the CONCORD Working Group (Cork, 
Ireland, 2012), at which the protocol was finalised. Detailed 
analyses of survival for adolescents, young adults, and 
older adults with leukaemia are under preparation for 
publication elsewhere.
Other studies of childhood cancer survival have not 
used net survival. The US SEER programme presents 
relative 
survival.18 
The 
European 
programmes, 
EUROCARE17 and ACCIS,7 present observed survival, 
because background mortality in children does not vary 
greatly between European populations. The CONCORD-2 
study has worldwide coverage, so we estimated net 
survival, because infant mortality varied particularly 
widely between participating countries.4 For example, 
infant mortality rates in males covered a 25-fold range in 
2007, from 3·0 per 1000 livebirths in Finland to 82·5 per 
1000 livebirths in Lesotho.13
Population-based cancer registry data include all or 
nearly all cases of a given malignancy in each registry’s 
jurisdiction. By contrast with the best achievable survival 
estimates obtained from patients included in clinical 
trials, population-based survival estimates reflect the 
survival of all cancer patients in the population, 
irrespective of socioeconomic status and disease features. 
They reflect the overall effectiveness of the health system, 
from parents’ perception of how to respond to symptoms 
suggestive of malignancy in their child, as well as the 
efficiency of referral, the quality of investigation and 
treatment, and the resourcing and organisation of the 
health service. 
In many high-income countries, the incidence of ALL 
is rising by an average of about 1% every year.7,18 Whether 
this is due to a true increase, improved registration, or 
both, is still debated.29 It is unlikely that improved 
diagnosis of the less aggressive forms of leukaemia can 
explain the very widespread rises in survival that we 
report. In many countries, childhood cancer treatment is 
provided in specialised centres, which makes cancer 
registration for children easier than for adults, although 
active follow-up can be more challenging in children and 
adolescents. Population-based cancer registry data might 
still be restricted by underdiagnosis and under-
registration of cancer patients, both of which are difficult 
to quantify. This might be a more important issue for 
participating registries in the 17 LMICs, but it is 
nevertheless 
important 
to 
capture 
the 
available 
information as a guide to policy. 
There is still room for improvement in the 
management of childhood leukaemia in many countries. 
In some LMICs, even the most basic treatment for 
leukaemia,28,30 or pain relief, was still not consistently 
available until recently.31 Abandonment of treatment is 
also a major issue in some settings.32,33 5-year survival for 
children with precursor-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia 
can be as high as 90%, and up to 80% for children with 
AML, but in some countries, survival remains below 
60% for both types of leukaemia. Interventions that have 
been proven to improve outcomes in childhood 
malignancy include enrolment in clinical trials, 
international collaboration, and treatment guidelines.5,34,35 
Wider implementation of these initiatives, together with 
mobilisation of additional resources, especially in poorer 
countries, would be likely to improve the delivery of 
effective 
treatments, 
and 
to 
reduce 
worldwide 
inequalities in survival.8,9,28,36,37
