Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Classic calciphylaxis associated with renal failure is a life-threatening disease. 
Warfarin-associated calciphylaxis without renal Injury has been described, but whether it is a 
subset of classic calciphylaxis or a different entity remains unknown. We describe 1 case of 
warfarin-associated calciphylaxis, present data from 2 others from our institution, and review all 
cases of warfarin-associated calciphylaxis available in the literature. Our review indicates that 
warfarin-associated calciphylaxis is clinically and pathophysiologically distinct from classic 
calciphylaxis.
OBJECTIVE—To review warfarin-associated calciphylaxis and determine its relationship to 
classic calciphylaxis.

 DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—We searched MEDLINE and Ovid without 
language or date restrictions for case reports of calciphylaxis from the inpatient setting using the 
terms “calciphylaxis and warfarin,” “non-uremic calciphylaxis,” and “nonuremic calciphylaxis.” 
We defined nonuremic calciphylaxis as a histopathologic diagnosis of calciphylaxis without severe 
kidney disease (serum creatinine level >3 mg/dL; glomerular filtration rate <15 mL/min; acute 
kidney injury requiring dialysis; and renal transplantation).
EXPOSURES—Each patient had been exposed to warfarin before the onset of calciphylaxis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Patient data were abstracted from published reports. 
Original patient medical records were requested and reviewed when possible.
RESULTS—We identified 18 patients with nonuremic calciphylaxis, 15 from the literature, and 3 
from our institution. Patients were predominantly female (15 of 18 [83%]) with ages ranging from 
19 to 86 years. Duration of warfarin therapy prior to calciphylaxis onset averaged 32 months. 
Lesions were usually located below the knees (in 12 of 18 [67%]). No cases reported elevated 
calcium-phosphate products (0 of 17 [0%]). Calcifications were most often noted in the tunica 
media (n = 8 [44%]) or in the vessel lumen and tunica intima (n = 7 [39%]). The most common 
treatments included substitution of heparin or low-molecular weight heparin for warfarin (n = 13 
[72%]), intravenous sodium thiosulfate (n = 9 [50%]), and hyperbaric oxygen (n = 3 [17%]). The 
survival rate on hospital discharge was remarkably high, with 15 cases (83%) reporting full 
recovery and 3 cases ending in death.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Warfarin-associated calciphylaxis is distinct from 
classic calciphylaxis in pathogenesis, course, and, particularly, outcome. This finding should 
influence clinical management of the disease and informs targeted treatment of the disease.
Calciphylaxis is a syndrome of cutaneous ischemic necrosis presenting as painful violaceous 
reticular patches or plaques that evolve into stellate ulcerations over the abdomen, thighs, 
and buttocks.1,2 These lesions result from arteriolar calcification with subsequent 
thrombosis, a 2-step process described by Weenig2 as the cutaneous equivalent of a 
myocardial infarction.
Calciphylaxis classically occurs with renal failure (calcific uremic arteriolopathy), but can 
also occur without kidney disease (nonuremic calciphylaxis), usually precipitated by 
hyperparathyroidism, liver disease, corticosteroids, malignant neoplasm, or warfarin.1,3,4 We 
describe a case of warfarin-associated calciphylaxis, present data from 2 others from our 
institution, and review all cases of warfarin-associated calciphylaxis available in the 
literature. Our review indicates that warfarin-associated calciphylaxis is a distinct clinical 
subgroup with separate pathophysiologic characteristics and a favorable prognosis.
Report of a Case
A woman in her 60s with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and 
atrial fibrillation presented with 1-year history of livedo reticularis and new palpable purpura 
over her bilateral lower extremities. She did not have renal disease or hyperparathyroidism, 
but she had taken warfarin for 2 years. A biopsy specimen showed calcification of small- to 
medium-size vessels within the subcutis, fat necrosis, and neovascularization. Ten days later,

 the patient developed tender stellate ulcers with purpuric borders, surrounding fixed livedo, 
and retiform purpura on her right leg including and extending beyond the biopsy site (Figure 
1). She was admitted to the hospital.
Laboratory data included a creatinine level of 0.69 mg/dL (reference range, 0.52–1.06 mg/
dL); calcium level, 9.4 mg/dL (reference range, 8.8–10.3 mg/dL); phosphate level, 4.3 
mg/dL (reference range, 2.6–4.9 mg/dL); serum calcium and phosphorus product level, 38 
mg2/dL2 (reference, <55 mg2/dL2); parathyroid hormone level, 24 pg/mL (reference range, 
12–65 pg/mL); aspartate aminotransferase level, 31 U/L (reference range, 17–42 U/L); 
alanine aminotransferase level, 43 U/L (reference range, 11–50 U/L); albumin level, 2.8 
g/dL (reference range, 3.5–4.8 g/dL), and international normalized ratio 2.0. Lupus 
anticoagulant screen was positive with negative Russell viper venom time; there was no 
factor V Leiden mutation; β2-glycoprotein IgG and IgM levels were less than 21 SGU; 
homocysteine level, 10 μmol/L (reference range, 4–14 μmol/L); antithrombin III activity, 
88% (reference range, 79%–120%); and protein C activity, 101% (reference range, 76%–
146%). Culture of the ulcer was negative for acid-fast bacilli. (To convert creatinine to 
micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4; to convert calcium to millimoles per liter, multiply by 
0.25; to convert aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase to microkatals per 
liter, multiply by 0.0167; and to convert albumin to grams per liter, multiply by 10.)
A second biopsy specimen showed calcification of small- to medium-size vessels within the 
subcutis and fat necrosis without neovascularization (Figure 2A). A von Kossa stain revealed 
perieccrine calcium deposition (Figure 2B). Owing to the presence of calcium within vessels 
in the subcutis, subcutaneous fat necrosis, perieccrine calcium deposition, and lack of 
clinically significant neovascularization, along with progression of clinical morphologic 
characteristics into fixed purpura, a diagnosis of calciphylaxis was made.
Warfarin was identified as the precipitant because the patient did not have renal failure or 
other risk factors. Treatment with rivaroxaban, pentoxifylline, and sodium thiosulfate 
resulted in full recovery.
Review of the Literature
We searched MEDLINE and Ovid without language or date restrictions using the terms 
“calciphylaxis and warfarin,” “nonuremic calciphylaxis,” and “nonuremic calciphylaxis.” 
We defined nonuremic calciphylaxis as a histopathologic diagnosis of calciphylaxis without 
severe kidney disease (serum creatinine level >3 mg/dL, GFR<15 mL/min, acute kidney 
injury requiring dialysis, and renal transplantation). We found 15 cases of warfarin-
associated nonuremic calciphylaxis in the literature and 3 cases from our institution.5–9
Patients were predominantly female (15 of 18 [83%]). Lesions were usually below the knees 
(12 of 18, 67%) but also on thighs, abdomen, and breasts (6 of 18 [33%]). Duration of 
warfarin prior to calciphylaxis onset ranged from 1 to 168 months (mean, 32 months). No 
cases reported elevated calcium-phosphate product, hypercoagulability, or rheumatologic 
disease (Table 1 and Table 2).

 Histopathologic analysis revealed calcification in all cases, most often in the tunica media (n 
= 8 [44%]) or in the vessel lumen and tunica intima (n = 7 [39%]). Other findings included 
ischemia and/or necrosis (n = 10 [56%]), extravascular calcification (n = 7 [39%]), 
endovascular fibrosis and/or hyperplasia (n = 6 [33%]), and thrombosis (n = 5 [28%]). 
Multiple biopsy specimens were required in 8 cases (44%) to render a definitive diagnosis.
Treatments included heparin (n = 13 patients [72%]), sodium thiosulfate (n = 9 [50%]), and 
hyperbaric oxygen (n = 3 patients [17%]). Three cases did not report either continuing or 
discontinuing warfarin; every other case reported stopping warfarin therapy. Survival to 
discharge was high (n = 15 patients [83%]). We did not observe recurrence after cessation of 
warfarin.
Discussion
Calciphylaxis was the most probable diagnosis in the case described herein because of the 
combination of specific histopathologic features, consistent morphologic characteristics, and 
exclusion of other disease (vasculitis, thrombophilia, and infection). The most compelling 
histopathologic evidence for calciphylaxis is a combination of vascular calcification of 
small- to medium-size vessels with fat necrosis and proximal vascular thrombosis. 
Distinguishing calciphylaxis from atherosclerotic disease with secondary vascular 
calcification and necrosis is challenging. Thrombosis is absent in atherosclerosis, but may 
also be missed in calciphylaxis owing to sampling error. A von Kossa stain may reveal 
perieccrine calcification, which can support the diagnosis of calciphyalxis.20 Perieccrine 
calcification was present in this case, strongly supporting the diagnosis of calciphylaxis in 
the context of stellate ulceration and exclusion of other disease.
In this series, warfarin-associated calciphylaxis often occurred in the presence of other risk 
factors for vessel narrowing or thrombosis, but these factors were not sufficient to cause 
disease. In our case series, warfarin was the proximal inciting risk factor for calciphylaxis, 
and symptoms resolved after discontinuation of warfarin. Although warfarin is an 
anticoagulant, it increases the odds of calciphylaxis up to 10-fold.1,3,21
The pathogenesis of warfarin-associated calciphylaxis is incompletely understood, but 
distinct from both classic calciphylaxis and warfarin-induced necrosis. Evidence suggests 
that warfarin promotes vascular calcification by inhibiting vitamin K-dependent matrix Gla 
protein, a protein that prevents calcium deposition in arteries.22 Thrombosis, the second step 
necessary for calciphylaxis, is counterintuitively increased by warfarin. We suspect that 
warfarin incites thrombosis by acting on vascular endothelial cells, which regulate the local 
microenvironment of procoagulant and anticoagulant factors by secreting proteins C and S 
in response to stress.23 Warfarin decreases protein S secretion in cultured endothelial cells 
by more than 90%.24 Thus, warfarin may inhibit normal endothelial cell responses to 
calcification and stress by blocking protein C and S, tipping the local balance in favor of 
thrombosis. This is distinct from systemic protein C and S deficiency, which typically occurs 
within 2 weeks and causes venous, not arterial, thrombosis.

 Clinically, warfarin-associated calciphylaxis and classic calciphylaxis both present with 
indurated plaques with overlying retiform purpura and central necrosis. However, this study 
identifies key differences between the 2 diseases. Warfarin-associated calciphylaxis tends to 
ulcerate below the knee, while ulcerations of classic calciphylaxis are usually proximal and 
over fat-bearing regions.1,4 Most important, mortality for warfarin-associated calciphylaxis 
in this study is 17%, much lower than the 50% to 80% mortality of classic calciphylaxis.1,4 
This difference may be confounded by absence of renal failure in our population and the 
distal location of ulcers.4
Warfarin-induced skin necrosis differs from warfarin-associated calciphylaxis in clinical 
presentation and pathogenesis. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis presents with hemorrhagic 
bullae with surrounding retiform purpura 3 to 10 days after warfarin initiation, whereas 
warfarin-associated calciphylaxis presented on average after 32 months as indurated retiform 
purpuric plaques with central necrosis favoring the lower extremities. Warfarin-induced skin 
necrosis arises from immediate hypercoagulability from decreased systemic protein C and S, 
whereas warfarin-associated calciphylaxis probably involves chronic vascular calcification 
and local inhibition of protein C and S with normal systemic levels.
These distinctions inform clinical management of warfarin-associated calciphylaxis. 
Clinicians should be alert to necrotic skin lesions well past the 10-day interval typical of 
warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Warfarin should be stopped, but protein C replacement is not 
beneficial because there is no systemic deficiency in protein C. Thrombolytics or 
anticoagulants can be used to reestablish perfusion. Sodium thiosulfate and/or 
bisphosphonates seem to benefit patients with nonuremic calciphylaxis, arguing that these 
therapies do more than alter the calcium-phosphate product.25 Sodium thiosulfate, for 
example, has antioxidant properties that aid wound healing.25 Vitamin K supplementation 
could theoretically counteract warfarin induced arteriolar calcification. The VitaVasK trial 
(NCT01742273), an evaluation of vitamin K for reducing vascular calcification, may 
provide evidence for vitamin K treatment in calciphylaxis.
Conclusions
Patients with warfarin-associated calciphylaxis are a distinct subgroup of patients with 
calciphylaxis. In particular, patients with warfarin-associated calciphylaxis have no calcium 
imbalance and have a favorable prognosis compared with those with classic calciphylaxis. 
Warfarin may cause both calcification of arteries and paradoxical thrombosis through local 
action on vascular endothelium. Better understanding the pathogenesis of calciphylaxis may 
lead to more specific and effective therapies.

 Key Points
Question
Is warfarin-associated calciphylaxis a distinct disease when compared with classic 
calciphylaxis, and, if so, what are its features?
Findings
In this review of reports of 18 patients with warfarin-associated calciphylaxis, 15 had 
used warfarin for an average of 32 months prior to calciphylaxis onset, and the most 
common treatments were substitution of heparin or low-molecular weight heparin for 
warfarin, intravenous sodium thiosulfate, and hyperbaric oxygen. Survival after hospital 
discharge was high with 15 cases (83%) reporting full recovery and 3 cases ending in 
death.
Meaning
Warfarin-associated calciphylaxis is distinct from classic calciphylaxis in pathogenesis, 
course, and outcome.
