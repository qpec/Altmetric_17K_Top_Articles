Objective: This study aimed to compare the immediate analgesic
effects of 2 resistance programs in in-season athletes with patellar
tendinopathy (PT). Resistance training is noninvasive, a principle stimulus
for corticospinal and neuromuscular adaptation, and may be analgesic.
Design: Within-season randomized clinical trial. Data analysis was
conducted blinded to group.
Setting: Subelite volleyball and basketball competitions.
Participants: Twenty jumping athletes aged more than 16 years,
participating in games/trainings 3 times per week with clinically
diagnosed PT.
Interventions: Two quadriceps resistance protocols were com-
pared; (1) isometric leg extension holds at 60 degrees knee flexion
(80% of their maximal voluntary isometric contraction) or (2)
isotonic leg extension (at 80% of their 8 repetition maximum) 4
times per week for 4 weeks. Time under load and rest between sets
was matched between groups.
Main Outcome Measures: (1) Pain (0-10 numerical rating score)
during single leg decline squat (SLDS), measured preintervention
and postintervention sessions. (2) VISA-P, a questionnaire about
tendon pain and function, completed at baseline and after 4 weeks.
Results: Twenty athletes with PT (18 men, mean 22.5 6 4.7 years)
participated (isotonic n = 10, isometric n = 10). Baseline median
SLDS pain was 5/10 for both groups (isotonic range 1-8, isometric
range 2-8). Isometric contractions produced significantly greater
immediate analgesia (P , 0.002). Week one analgesic response pos-
itively correlated with improvements in VISA-P at 4 weeks (r2 = 0.64).
Conclusions: Both protocols appear efficacious for in-season
athletes to reduce pain, however, isometric contractions demonstrated
significantly greater immediate analgesia throughout the 4-week trial.
Greater analgesia may increase the ability to load or perform.
Key Words: isometric, isotonic, resistance training, analgesia, in-

INTRODUCTION
Patellar tendon pain can be debilitating and cause
attrition from physical activity1 #237. However, athletes can
often continue to play with tendon pain yet at reduced training
volumes or frequency to prioritize participation in games/
competition. Performance might be compromised in people
with chronic or recurrent pain because of physical deficits
associated with tendinopathy2 #66993; #9, excessive cogni-
tive demand associated with pain4 #8505, decreased cognitive
resources5 #8651, or disrupted spatial and motor representa-
tions associated with evaluation of ongoing threat (see6 #983;
#9 for relevant reviews). Thus, it is important to investigate
methods of reducing tendon pain in-season that allow the
athlete to fulfill their playing and training commitments.
Exercise-based treatments are but one type of the many
available treatments for tendinopathy. Other options include
injection therapies7 #86528; #8653, extracorporeal shockwave
therapy9 #865410; #8507, surgery11 #865612; #376, and many
other treatments that are not without risk and often come at
great expense. Furthermore, invasive interventions are fre-
quently based on animal models of induced tendon injury that
may not replicate the pathoaetiology of human load–based ten-
dinopathy (i.e., collagenase injections13 #8643) nor do they
have long-term data on their efficacy. Finally, and importantly,
athletes are often reluctant to follow advice to have downtime
after such interventions, which means they either have the treat-
ment but not the downtime, or decline the treatment altogether.
Tendon load through exercise is the only stimulus that
positively affects the tendon matrix14 #8657 and has been
shown to reduce pain perception and improve function over

 time15 #6118. There are a number of variably efficacious
exercise programs for tendinopathy16 #277217; #4; however,
few studies have compared the effect of different exercise
regimes on immediate analgesia. Immediate improvement in
symptoms throughout an exercise-based rehabilitation pro-
gram may lead to better adherence or improved performance.
Several studies have evaluated eccentric exercise in
patellar tendinopathy (PT) with clinical outcomes. It has been
shown that eccentric exercise increased pain in the first 2 to 4
weeks18 #1186. Investigations of eccentric exercise in-season
have either shown no benefit19 #198 or worse outcomes20
#195. Given that eccentric exercise is poorly tolerated by
the in-season athlete, other muscle contraction protocols war-
rant investigation.
One study has directly compared isotonic contractions
(heavy slow resistance) with isolated eccentric exercise.
Isotonic contractions were as effective as eccentric only
exercise in PT and with higher patient satisfaction over time21
#6066. The immediate effect (either increase or decrease in
tendon pain) was not reported. Athletes in that study remained
active if their pain was less than 3/10 on a numerical rating
scale (NRS) and activity levels were not significantly differ-
ent from baseline, thus findings may not be applicable to the
in-season environment. Rio et al, (2015) reported that iso-
metric contractions demonstrated superior pain relief in terms
of immediate effect on single leg decline squat (SLDS) pain
lasting at least 45 minutes and without a decline in muscle
performance.44 However, this was a single intervention and
the cumulative effect of the intervention in-season is
unknown. Neither isometric nor isotonic contractions resulted
in an increase in pain in the Rio et al, (2014) study, thus these
contraction types may be better tolerated than eccentric con-
tractions in an in-season trial.44
There are clear benefits to inducing immediate analge-
sia without muscle fatigue in a sporting environment. Athletes
may choose to complete the protocol immediately before
training or competition, which could result in continued and/
or greater participation in competitive sport. Therefore, the
primary aim of this study was to compare the immediate
effect of resistance training that involved either isometric or
isotonic muscle contractions on patellar tendon pain during
a 4-week competitive season in jumping athletes. It was
hypothesized that isometric muscle contractions would pro-
vide greater immediate analgesia than isotonic contractions.
The secondary aim of the study was to compare the effect of
isometric and isotonic contractions on pain and function as
measured by the VISA-P after 4 weeks. It was hypothesized
that both groups would improve more than the minimum
clinically important difference (MCID) after 4 weeks.
METHOD
This randomized clinical trial over 4 weeks had 2
intervention arms, either isometric or isotonic quadriceps
muscle contractions. Twenty-nine male and female volleyball
and basketball athletes aged more than 16 years were
recruited from subelite and elite competitions. The study
was approved by the Monash University Human Research
Ethics
Committee,
Australia
(CF12/0230—2012000067).
This trial was registered in the Australian New Zealand Clin-
ical Trial Registry (ACTRN12613000871741) and all athletes
provided written informed consent. These data formed part of
larger trial (van Ark et al, 2016).45
Clinical diagnosis of PT was defined as pain localized to
the inferior pole of the patella during jumping and landing
activities and during testing on the SLDS, a reliable patellar
tendon pain provocation test22 #1173,23; #8626. The diagnosis
was confirmed by the presence of characteristic features on ultra-
sound imaging (eg, hypoechoic area and/or tendon thickening).
Exclusion criteria were the existence of other knee pathology,
previous patellar tendon rupture, previous patellar tendon sur-
gery, inflammatory disorders, metabolic bone diseases, and type
II diabetes, use of fluroquinolones or corticosteroids in the last 12
months, known familial hypercholesterolemia and fibromyalgia.
Baseline Testing
Participant height (cm) (Seca 213, Birmingham, West
Midlands UK) and weight (kg) were recorded (Omron HN283
Port Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) without footwear. Meas-
urements were recorded 3 times and the mean was recorded if
there was any variability. VISA-P, a questionnaire about
patellar tendon pain and athletic function were completed
where a score of 100 represents full pain-free function24 #236.
Baseline maximal voluntary isometric contraction was tested
and recorded for participants randomized to the isometric
group. Eight repetition maximum was tested for isotonic group.
This provided the starting weight for week 1. All testing was
completed on the same leg extension machine that each indi-
vidual participant used for the duration of the trial.
Randomization Procedure
Randomization was completed using the random number
generator function (Excel 2007, Redmond, WA) and concealed
inside an unmarked, individual opaque envelope25 #7789. Par-
ticipants selected a small envelope from a larger opaque,
unmarked envelope that contained the code for the groups.
Intervention
Investigators determined the starting weights in the first
session as described above. This session also demonstrated
the intervention and the exercise diary. The exercise diary
recorded the weight completed for each session and the
preexercise and postexercise pain scores. This was a NRS
from zero to 10 while completing 1 single repetition on the
SLDS for each leg.
Both protocols were completed on a leg extension
machine (Table 1). The leg extension machine was chosen as
a way of isolating the quadriceps muscle group without pain
(Rio et al, 2015).44 Because muscle work during isometric
and isotonic muscle contractions cannot be directly measured,
protocols were matched for ratings of perceived exertion dur-
ing pilot studies. All participants were provided with an audi-
tory recording, which also served to pace participants and
match time under tension and rest periods. The recovery
length of 1 minute was chosen to allow muscle recovery26
#33. Athletes were requested to avoid other quadriceps exer-
cises during the 4 weeks but were free to complete all other
gym, training, and competition.

 A researcher contacted each participant weekly and
weight was increased by 2.5% if all sessions were completed
at the previous weight and if the athlete felt they could
increase the weight. Otherwise, the weight was maintained for
a further week. Participants were instructed to lower the
weight on the machine for the next repetition if they were not
able to complete their repetitions (for example owing to
fatigue-induced muscle shaking). Therefore, they still com-
plete the entire session so that there was equal time under
tension.
Follow-up
At the end of 4 weeks, participants completed a VISA-P
and returned their completed exercise diaries.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measure for the study was the
difference in pain during a SLDS before and after every
intervention session. Secondary outcome measure was the
VISA-P completed at baseline and 4 weeks, a change in score
of more than 13 has been shown to be the MCID for the
VISA-P27 #638.
Data and Statistical Analysis
For those athletes with bilateral symptoms, the side that
they reported the highest NRS on the SLDS at baseline
training was chosen for analysis. If this was equal, the limb
was chosen at random. Change in pre-NRS and post-NRS
pain scores were calculated by subtracting the prescore from
the postscore for every session. If the data did not satisfy
assumptions of parametric statistical tests, then the equivalent
nonparametric analysis was used. Starting weights were
recorded and mean and SD is presented. For those partic-
ipants who returned their diaries but missed sessions, the last
observation carried forward (LOCF) method was applied.
Athletes who were randomized but did not complete any
sessions were excluded from analysis28 #8642. Intention to
treat analysis was performed for athletes who failed to return
their booklets but were known to complete at least 1 session;
they were allocated a pre-NRS score of 5 and a post-NRS
score of 5 so that the change score was zero. This conserva-
tive option was selected to avoid overestimating the effect
using the group median28 #8642. Area under the curve was
used to measure exposure, in this case analgesia from the
intervention training. A correlation was performed between
the response in week 1 and the final VISA-P change score to
identify potential responders to in-season training. Signifi-
cance was set at a = 0.05.
RESULTS
Twenty-nine athletes were randomized to the study, 7
athletes did not complete any of the intervention sessions
because they were unable to be contacted by the researchers
after randomization. Two athletes dropped out during the
intervention period, 1 for personal reasons and the other for
an unrelated injury (both prevented basketball participation).
Both were excluded from analysis because they were no
longer playing/training 3 times per week. Twenty athletes
were included in the analysis,10in each group. One athlete in
the isotonic group and 2 athletes in the isometric group did
not return their booklet and were therefore allocated a change
score of zero for the duration of the intervention period. The
groups did not differ at baseline for measures of tendon pain
and function (SLDS and VISA-P) and starting load (Table 2).
Athletes in both groups continued to play and train 3 times
per week, with no athlete missing any games or team training
sessions because of tendon pain. Data were not normally
distributed and nonparametric analysis was used.
Reduction in pain between premeasures and postmeas-
ures of every intervention session was greater for the
isometric group (mean 6 SD change = 1.8 6 0.39) than it
was for the isotonic group (0.9 6 0.25, Cohens d = 2.75, P ,
0.001; Figure 1). This corresponded to a greater volume of
area under the curve that is increased analgesia in the iso-
metric group (AUC isometric 26.00, isotonic 14.23).
Both groups improved their VISA-P over the 4 weeks,
and there were no significant differences between groups at
follow-up (P = 0.99). There was variability in the response
including 2 athletes whose VISA-P score was worse in the
isotonic group and 2 whose scores did not change (one in
each group) (Figure 2). Neither group median was greater
than the MCID, the isotonic group score change was 10.5

 points, and the isometric group change was 11.5 points. The
median VISA-P in both groups was greater than 80/100 at the
end of the 4-week intervention (isotonic group 80/100, range
60-94, and isometric group 84/100, range 41-100). Five ath-
letes out of 10 in the isotonic group achieved greater than 80/
100 and 7 athletes out of 10 achieved greater than 80/100 at
the end of 4 weeks.
There was a moderate positive correlation between the
mean change in NRS in week 1 and the change in VISA-P
score (r2 = 0.64). Approximately, 60% of the variance in the
VISA-P change from baseline to follow-up was explained by
the analgesic response to exercise in week 1.
The starting weight for participants was mean 29.5 6
9.6 kg in the isometric group and 29.5 6 9.9 kg in the iso-
tonic group. The weight increase was modest over 4 weeks;
0.9 6 3.5 kg for the isometric group, and 1.45 6 1.7 kg for
the isotonic group. If athletes had progressed according to the
2.5% increase, the overall increase would have been at least 3
kg for both groups over the 4 weeks.
DISCUSSION
Isometric muscle contractions resulted in significantly
greater immediate analgesia than isotonic muscle contractions
in a 4-week trial while athletes were playing and training.
There are potential benefits to the increased immediate pain
relief demonstrated by isometric exercise. First, less pain may
lead to higher activity intensity or participation in more
training sessions. It is also possible that athletes may spend
less time in pain over the course of the week, particularly in
light of previous research demonstrating at least a 45-minute
effect associated with isometric but not isotonic exercise (Rio,
2015 #9161).44 There are several additional benefits to reduc-
ing evoked pain with resistance training, including removing
fear of exercise,29 #8644, improved self efficacy in that they
can modulate their own pain (and this is analgesic in itself)30
#8646, and an improved sense of control, as anxiety, closely
linked to low sense of control, has differential and synergistic
effects on pain31 #8647. Moreover, the contextual cues asso-
ciated with “active” analgesia imply recovery, health, and
capacity, whereas the contextual cues associated with “pas-
sive” analgesia, such as ice, imply tissue damage and inflam-
mation. Such cues are potentially powerful modulators of
subsequent behavioral choices (e.g., increased participation
in rehabilitation), as well as pain (see [Moseley, 2015
#9169] for relevant review). Finally, active analgesia stands
to offer benefits at a tissue level, for example, to the quadri-
ceps muscle architecture32 #8645, tendon properties33 #4568,
and cortical drive to the quadriceps34 #5966.
The antinociceptive effect of motor activation may be
explained by several potential centrally mediated mechanisms.
Motor centers have direct projections to the dorsal horn35 #8667
and also to midbrain centers that are themselves powerful gen-
erators of descending inhibition. Completing maximal or near
maximal effort without tissue damage reinforces positive ef-
fects36 #8596. Furthermore, fatiguing tasks that require effort
and demand attention compete with pain to influence the output
generator37 #864838; #8650. However, these mechanisms may

 not explain the differences between isometric and isotonic mus-
cle contractions as both protocols required fatiguing motor acti-
vation with cognitive demand. Therefore, they may also be
differences in the local tissue response to the 2 types of con-
tractions (such as nociceptive receptor stimulation or change to
the biochemical environment) and/or unique differences in the
cortical activation pattern between isometric and isotonic mus-
cle contractions. Previous studies have reported a hypoalgesic
effect of exercise depending on the type; aerobic exercise
reduced perception of experimentally induced pain in healthy
people (effect size for threshold d = 0.41, intensity d = 0.59),
dynamic/isotonic exercise (threshold d = 0.83, intensity d =
0.75) and isometric exercise (threshold d = 1.02, intensity d =
0.72),39 #8668.
After 4 weeks, there were no differences between
groups in the VISA-P and neither group median was greater
than the MCID (a change score of 13 or 15.4% of their
original score). The VISA-P is a robust measure and is not
traditionally repeated in clinical practice or in research after
only 4 weeks. Ten athletes (5 in each group) improved more
than 13 points, and 12 athletes scored more than 80 on their
VISA-P at follow-up (5 in the isotonic group and 7 in the
isometric group) demonstrating variability in response. A
VISA-P score of less than 80 is considered to represent
tendon pain that is causing impairment and reduced function24
#236 indicating an important clinical shift in about half of the
participants here in not just pain but also function.
An increase in analgesia in the first 4 sessions (week 1)
was positively correlated with a greater increase in the VISA-
P after 4 weeks. Early response to either intervention
explained approximately 60% in the variance of the final
VISA-P score. Our objective here was not to compare the 2
approaches for their long-term effects on VISA-P score, and
we were underpowered to add another primary hypothesis,
but this relationship between short-term analgesia and long-
term VISA-P score suggests that it may be possible to identify
after a single session those athletes most likely to respond to
in-season training of the kind used here.
Athletes with bilateral symptoms were included in this
study to maximize participant numbers21 #6066. Bilateral
symptoms are common in PT and thus including those with
either unilateral or bilateral symptoms is representative of the
active population with PT (Lian, 2005 #635).43 Studies exam-
ining jumping ability and performance have not investigated
a difference in those with unilateral or bilateral symptoms
(Lian, 2003 #8756; Lian, 1996 #9146)41,42 and numbers were
too small to enable any comparison between those with unilat-
eral and those with bilateral symptoms within groups. Future
studies should aim to maximize participant numbers and inves-
tigate potential differences in responses of these subgroups.
The 2 athletes who scored lower in the VISA-P at the end
of the intervention in the isotonic group reported pain reduction
throughout the intervention in their preexercise and postexercise
scores. These results are difficult to reconcile and future studies
may consider inclusion of qualitative data to better identify
individual factors that lead to a positive outcome.
This pragmatic randomized clinical trial demonstrated
that both isometric and isotonic exercise were well tolerated
in the in-season athlete. Both protocols seem to be efficacious
in-season in contrast with previous studies investigating
eccentric exercise20 #11,19 #198. Athletes did not miss any
game or training sessions because of tendon pain, which is
important as training sessions are sometimes sacrificed to
prioritize games even at the subelite and elite levels.
The weight increase for both groups was small and half
of what was calculated based on a 2.5% weekly increase. The
projected increase was based on hypertrophy studies and may
not be possible on top of in-season loads or in a cohort with
musculoskeletal pain. Alternatively, supervision of sessions
actually may have assisted weight progression, because heavy
load has been shown to be important in reducing tendon pain
perception (Rio, 2015 #9161).44 It is possible that athletes were
fearful of overload and too conservative. The most plausible
explanation is that increments on the leg extension machines
were more than 2.5%, thus the next increment was too great and
in many cases it was difficult to find small appropriate weights.
This study had multiple strengths that provide imme-
diate clinical utility. First, it was an in-season intervention
(when tendon pain is highest) that was specifically aimed at
providing analgesia. Second, it was a short-term study, and
this may have improved adherence, although adherence is
likely to be high with an intervention that reduces pain.
Athletes could choose when to complete the intervention, thus
making it convenient. They could also then use the analgesia
at a time they considered most beneficial and that may be
before games and/or after games. Third, it was a pragmatic
trial, it reflects real life where training loads and game volume
were uncontrolled; for example, volleyball matches can be up
to 5 sets but may only be 3.
This study had limitations, most importantly the
missing exercise booklets from athletes. Using a zero change
score is conservative because the median change score of
both groups was positive. This approach can dilute the effect
size, whereas using the group median may inflate the effect
size. Importantly, these athletes were not drop outs (in which
case it may be considered that they dropped out because of
a negative effect). The VISA-P score for the athlete in the
isotonic group was unchanged (so perhaps using a change
score of zero is appropriate) but the 2 athletes in the isometric
group for whom LOCF was used, VISA-P changed by 4 and
13 points, thus using a change score of zero may not reflect
their analgesic response. The 2 athletes who dropped out
during the trial were also excluded because they were no
longer playing/training 3 times per week, and therefore scores
may artificially improve because of reduced tendon load.
Because this was a pragmatic trial, there was no
supervision of sessions and thus may not have all been
completed. As athletes chose when to complete the interven-
tion sessions, it was not feasible to provide supervision.
Athletes were reporting consistent pain reduction with the
protocols (in both groups), therefore it is expected that
adherence was high (as it was beneficial) and that the exercise
diaries were completed accurately. Future studies of this
nature should record how long the analgesia lasted, although
it is also important to minimize participant burden especially
when conducting in-season research.
A control group was not included because natural
history of PT does improve during a season19 #198 and can

Isometric Muscle Contractions Reduce Tendon Pain More Than Isotonics

 last for years (Ferretti, 1985 #8525).40 Furthermore, because
these were in-season athletes with pain competing at the elite
and subelite level, we considered a sham to be unethical. We
investigated 2 types of muscle contractions because no pre-
vious study had found a positive result for any active in-
season intervention leaving clinicians without in-season reha-
bilitation guidelines.
Athletes were requested to remove other quadriceps
exercises from their training for 4 weeks. This was due to 2
factors. First, as part of this study, corticospinal responses
were recorded from a subset of the population and other
quadriceps training would have impacted on those results.
Second, it is a clinical observation that many of the other
quadriceps exercises that people complete are actually pro-
vocative for patellar tendon pain, such as lunges where the
knee is forward of the ankle. Therefore, it was preferable to
reduce nociceptive drive where possible by limiting these and
evaluating the effect of one nonprovocative quadriceps
exercise. It is possible athletes continued quadriceps exercises
and did not inform researchers.
The audio file was provided to externally pace and
counters the potential variability in the way the exercises were
completed, but it is not known if this was used by all athletes
for every session. The same results may not have been
observed without the use of the auditory pacing because this
has been shown to be important for modifying both cortico-
spinal excitability and inhibition (Leung et al, in press) and
these processes may underpin the results observed. Future
studies should consider recording when the athletes com-
pleted the protocol in relation to pre/post training or games
or on rest days. This would provide more information about
when the timing of such interventions has the greatest benefit.
Ethical Considerations
Only active interventions were offered because these
were elite and subelite athletes, in pain in-season, and thus it
was considered unethical to offer a sham intervention.
In conclusion, isometric and isotonic protocols have
a role in the in-season athlete and that individualized clinical
decision making could further enhance athlete response. This is
not possible in an randomized clinical trial. This study however
provides clinicians with 2 potential options in athletes with PT
in-season without fear of increasing tendon pain. Pragmati-
cally, clinicians can select the protocol that provided more pain
relief as this is likely to be preferable for the athlete, and these
data would support the use of isometric exercise in that
instance. Week 1 NRS response also seems to be correlated
with VISA-P change at 4 weeks. Exercise-based analgesia
could be used to reduce pain after high intensity sessions or
before games/trainings. Future studies should attempt to record
load beyond participation to determine whether increased pain
relief allows athletes to load more and if this has positive or
negative ramifications.
