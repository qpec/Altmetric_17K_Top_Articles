ABSTRACT
Objective: The hypothalamus of hypercaloric diet-induced obese animals is featured by a significant increase of microglial reactivity and its
associated cytokine production. However, the role of dietary components, in particular fat and carbohydrate, with respect to the hypothalamic
inflammatory response and the consequent impact on hypothalamic control of energy homeostasis is yet not clear.
Methods: We dissected the different effects of high-carbohydrate high-fat (HCHF) diets and low-carbohydrate high-fat (LCHF) diets on hypo-
thalamic inflammatory responses in neurons and non-neuronal cells and tested the hypothesis that HCHF diets induce hypothalamic inflammation
via advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) using mice lacking advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) receptor (RAGE) and/or the activated
leukocyte cell-adhesion molecule (ALCAM).
Results: We found that consumption of HCHF diets, but not of LCHF diets, increases microgliosis as well as the presence of N(ε)-(Carbox-
ymethyl)-Lysine (CML), a major AGE, in POMC and NPY neurons of the arcuate nucleus. Neuron-secreted CML binds to both RAGE and ALCAM,
which are expressed on endothelial cells, microglia, and pericytes. On a HCHF diet, mice lacking the RAGE and ALCAM genes displayed less
microglial reactivity and less neovasculature formation in the hypothalamic ARC, and this was associated with significant improvements of
metabolic disorders induced by the HCHF diet.
Conclusions: Combined overconsumption of fat and sugar, but not the overconsumption of fat per se, leads to excessive CML production in
hypothalamic neurons, which, in turn, stimulates hypothalamic inflammatory responses such as microgliosis and eventually leads to neuronal
dysfunction in the control of energy metabolism.

1. INTRODUCTION
Containing highly heterogeneous neuronal and glial populations that
receive and integrate diverse metabolic feedback signals from the
periphery, the hypothalamus is key for metabolic sensing and regu-
lation. Accumulating evidence points to disrupted hypothalamic
functioning as a major player in hypercaloric diet-induced obesity and
associated metabolic disorders [1e3]. The hypothalamus of hyper-
calorically diet-induced obese animals is characterized by an increased
inflammatory response, reflected in part by a significant increase of
microglial reactivity, particularly in the area of the arcuate nucleus
(ARC),

 opiomelanocortin (POMC) and the orexigenic agouti-related peptide
(AgRP)/neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons. The increase of microglial
reactivity is accompanied by astrocytosis and de novo angiogenesis,
and, in the long run, leads to the loss of POMC neurons [2e4].
In hypercaloric diet-induced obesity, dietary fats, and especially
saturated fatty acids, are considered to be the essential component
initiating pro-inflammatory responses in the hypothalamus [5]. How-
ever, the role of dietary carbohydrates with respect to the hypothalamic
inflammatory response and the consequent impact on hypothalamic
control of energy homeostasis is not yet clear. In the current series of
mouse and rat studies, we documented that the mediobasal hypo-
thalamic inflammatory response occurs in response to high-fat diets
rich in carbohydrates (high-carbohydrate high-fat (HCHF) diets), but not
in response to a low-carbohydrate, high-fat (LCHF) diet. This HCHF-
induced mediobasal hypothalamic inflammatory response was medi-
ated by advanced glycation end products (AGEs) produced by hypo-
thalamic neurons acting on microglia, endothelial cells, and pericytes
that express AGE receptors. Genetic deletion of AGE receptors in mice
fed a HCHF diet resulted in less microglial reactivity and less angi-
opathy in the hypothalamic ARC than in their WT controls, as well as
reducing the severity of the metabolic disorders induced by the HCHF
diet.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Animals
All rodent studies were approved by and performed according to the
guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
Helmholtz Center Munich, or the University of Cincinnati. Male mice
and rats were housed on a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle (light from 7 am
to 7 pm) at 22 �C with free access to food and water. Generation of
receptor of advanced glycation end products KO (RAGE�/�) mice is
described elsewhere [6]; activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule
KO (ALCAM�/�) mice, POMCeGFP and NPYeGFP mice were purchased
from the Janvier (Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France) or Jackson Laboratory
(Bar Harbor, ME, USA) with the C57BL/6 genetic background. RAGE
and ALCAM double-knockout mice were generated by cross-breeding
ALCAM�/� and RAGE�/� mice. Diets were custom designed and
purchased from Provimi Kliba Nafag (Kaiseraugst, Switzerland) or
purchased from Research Diet (D12331). Body weight and food intake
were monitored according to each experimental design.
Whole body composition was measured using NMR technology
(EchoMRI, Houston, TX). Fat and lean body mass were calculated as a
percentage of total body weight.
2.2. Glucose tolerance test
Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests were performed for the deter-
mination of the effects of deletion of RAGE and ALCAM genes on
glucose metabolism in mice fed chow or HCHF diet. Mice were fasted
for 6 h (8:00 to 14:00), and tail blood glucose level was measured
before (t ¼ 0) and after intraperitoneal glucose injection (2 g/kg BW) at
t ¼ 15, 30, 60, and 120 min, by using a handheld glucometer
(TheraSense FreeStyle).
2.3. CML infusion into mediobasal hypothalamus
For CML infusion into the MBH, with a standard Kopf stereotaxic
apparatus, bilateral infusion probe was placed into the top of the
arcuate nucleus in the brain of Wistar rats (AP: �3.14 mm, L: 0.6 mm,
V: �9.8 mm) (average body weight of rats is 300 g). After recovery,
artificial cerebral fluid (aCSF, as vehicle) or CML (5 mg in 2 ml aCSF)
was infused via the probe into the MBH, once per day, in 7 consecutive
days. Rats were sacrificed by perfusion fixation 4 h after last infusion.
2.4. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining
For immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining, mice and
rats were rapidly euthanized in CO2 and transcardially perfused with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% neutral buffered
paraformaldehyde (Fisher Scientific). Brains were extracted, equili-
brated in 30% sucrose, sectioned coronally on a cryostat (Leica Bio-
systems) at 30 mm and collected and rinsed in 0.1 M TBS. Mouse
brains for vessel length measurement by the FITC-albumin infusion
approach were prepared by emulsion fixation with 4% para-
formaldehyde after receiving FITC-albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) infusion, sucrose equilibration and sectioning.
2.4.1. Immunohistochemical staining
Brain sections were incubated with primary antibody of rabbit anti-
iba1
(1:1500,
Synaptic
Systems,
Germany),
rabbit
anti-GFAP
(1:2000, DAKO, Germany), rabbit anti-PDGFRb (1:500, Abcam,
USA), or rabbit anti-CML (1:500, Abcam, USA). Primary antibodies
were incubated overnight at 4 �C. Sections were rinsed and incu-
bated in biotinylated secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG; sections were
then rinsed and incubated in avidin-biotin complex (ABC method,
Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) for 1 h, and the reaction
product was visualized by incubation in 1% diaminobenzidine with
0.01% hydrogen peroxide for 5e7 min. Sections were mounted on
gelatin-coated glass slides, dried, dehydrated through a graded
ethanol series, cleared in xylene, and cover-slipped for image
collection and quantification. For image analysis, microscope: Zeiss
AXIO Scope A1, objective lenses: Plan-APOCHROMAT 10X/0.45,
Camera: Zeiss, AxioCam MRc, Acquisition software: AxioRel Vision
4.8. Imaging quantification was performed blinded; cell numbers
were manually counted within a framed area inside the ARC. The
coverage of the iba1-ir and GFAP-ir positive cells, and the integrative
density of CML-ir cells was measured by ImageJ. For measurement
of cell coverage, 8-bit images collected from iba1 and GFAP staining
were processed into binary pictures, and the area covered by the
immunoreactive cells and their processes was measured. For
microglia, the total area of coverage was then divided by the number
of iba1-ir microglia counted in the same area in the ARC, to obtain
the data for iba1-ir coverage per cell. For astrocytes, data of the total
coverage area were presented.
2.4.2. Immunofluorescent staining
For detecting the colocalization of CML with GFP (in PomceGFP or
NpyeGFP mice, in which GFP can be visualized directly by fluorescent
microscope), brains sections were incubated with rabbit anti-CML
(1:200) primary antibody overnight at 4 �C as described above.
Sections were rinsed and incubated with biotinylated secondary horse
anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h, and then rinsed and incubated with
streptavidin-conjugated Alexa Fluor� 594 or 647 (Jackson Immu-
noResearch, USA) for 1 h. For detecting the colocalization of CML
with NeuN or GFAP, brains sections were incubated with primary
antibodies of rabbit anti-CML (1:200), in combination with mouse
anti-NeuN (1:200) or goat anti-GFAP (1:500. Abcam, USA) overnight
at 4 �C as described above. Sections were rinsed and incubated with
biotinylated secondary horse anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h, and then rinsed
and incubated with streptavidin-conjugated Alexa Fluor� 594 or 647,
in combination with goat anti-mouse IgG-conjugated Alexa Fluor�
647 or donkey anti-goat IgG-conjugated Alexa Fluor� 594 (Jackson

 ImmunoResearch, USA) for 1 h. For detecting the colocalization of
GFP (in RAGE�/� or ALCAM�/� mice, in which GFP can be detected
by anti-GFP antibody) with laminin, iba1, PDGFRb, NeuN, POMC,
CML, and GFAP, brain sections were incubated with goat anti-GFP
(1:200), in combination with one of the primary antibodies: chicken
anti-laminin (1:1000, Abcam, USA), rabbit anti-iba1 (1:300), rabbit
anti-PDGFRb (1:200), mouse anti-NeuN (1:200, Milipore), rabbit anti-
POMC (1:300, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, USA), rabbit anti-GFAP
(1:1000), or rabbit anti-CML (1:200) was incubated overnight at
4 �C as described above. Next, sections were rinsed and incubated
with biotinylated secondary donkey anti-goat IgG for 1 h; sections
were then rinsed and incubated with streptavidin-conjugated Alexa
Fluor� 488 or 594 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, USA) in combination
with goat anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated Alexa Fluor� 488, 594 or 647,
goat anti-chicken IgG conjugated Alexa Fluor� 594, or goat anti-
mouse conjugated Alexa Fluor� 594 for 1 h. All sections were then
rinsed and mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides, dried, covered
with polyvinyl alcohol mounting medium containing DABCO� (Sigma,
USA), observed and imaged by confocal microscopy (Leica SP5,
Germany). For image analysis, microscope: Leica TCS SP5 II,
objective lenses: HCX PL APO, 63x, NA¼1.3, Imaging medium:
Glycerol, Fluorochromes: Alexa 488, 594 & 647, Camera: Leica TCS
SP5 II, Acquisition software: LAS AF, image processing: IMARIS7.6.4
(Bitplane, UK). Mouse brains for vessel length measurement by
Fluorescein (FITC)-albumin infusion approach were performed as
described before. For vascular density analysis, images were skele-
tonized before histogram analysis [4].
2.5. Western blot analysis
Tissues from the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) of Chow, HCHF1,
HCHF2, LCHF1, and LCHF2 diet-fed mice were snap frozen for
detection of two major AGEs modified proteins e the CML-modified
proteins and the methylglyoxal (MG-H1)-modified proteins. The CML
and MG(-H1) antibodies were generated by the Nawroth lab using non-
reactive peptide antigens that contain the modification in a specific
location. The specificity for the modification was tested using similar
chemical-defined peptides and in both cases the specificity is 100%
for CML or MG-H1. Neither of the antibodies showed any reactivity for
any other AGEs. After protein extraction, protein concentration was
determined by BCA assay. The same amount of protein from lysates
was placed in 1.5-mL tubes. 4� NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (Invi-
trogen) was added to each and incubated at 95 �C for 5 min. After
heating, the mixture was kept on ice for 20 min. Twenty mg protein
lysates from each sample were then separated by 10% precast gel
(Bio-Rad), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). After
the transfer, the membranes were blocked in non-protein blocking
buffer (Thermo Scientific, to prevent AGEs contamination) for 1 h.
Primary antibodies (rat anti-MG-H1 monoclonal antibody, 10 mg/ml)
were diluted in non-protein blocking buffer and incubated with the
membrane overnight at 4 �C. On the following day, membranes were
washed by Tris-buffered saline with Tween (TBST) three times for
10 min and incubated with the HRP conjugated secondary antibody for
1 h at room temperature and washed again in TBST (three times for
10 min). Membranes were then developed by ECL (Bio-Rad) and
imaged with Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR Bioscience). The blots
with anti-CML and anti-beta-actin were performed consecutively after
the membrane from MG-H1 blotting was stripped and incubated with
either mouse anti-CML monoclonal antibody (0.25 mg/ml) or rabbit
anti-beta-actin (Cell Signaling).
2.6. CML treating hypothalamic microglia
For CML treatment of hypothalamic microglia, primary cultured hy-
pothalamic microglia were obtained from dissected hypothalamus on
postnatal day 2 and cultured by a method adapted from Saura et al. [7].
Seventeen days afterward, cells received serum starvation for 5 h and
were treated with CML (50 mM) or vehicle for 16 h. Microglia were then
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for gene or protein expression analysis.
2.7. Far-western blotting analysis
Far-Western blotting analysis was executed as described before [8].
Briefly, 2 mg recombinant CD166/ALCAM protein (Recombinant
Mouse ALCAM/CD166 Fc Chimera; R&D Systems) and RAGE protein
(Recombinant Mouse RAGE Fc Chimera R&D Systems) were sepa-
rated on 10% SDS gels (Bio-rad cat.567-1033) and transferred to
PVDF membranes. Membranes were then incubated with AC buffer
(100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris [pH 7.6], 0.5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol,
0.1% Tween-20, and 1 mM DTT) containing guanidine-HCl 6 M, 3 M,
1 M for 30 min at room temperature, followed by AC-buffer (guani-
dine-HCL 0.1 M and 0 M) at 4 �C for 30min and 1 h, respectively,
and finally blocked with protein free blocking buffer (Fisher Scientific
Cat. No.10269613) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were
then incubated with 1.5mM of CML-human serum albumin (HSA) or
lysine (as vehicle control, Sigma, cat. No.L5551) in protein-binding
buffer (100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris [pH 7.6], 10% glycerol, 0.1%
Tween-20, 1 mM DTT, 4 mM CaCl2) overnight at 4 �C. On the
following day, membranes were washed four times with TBS with
Tween 20(0.1%) and then incubated with anti-CML Ab (Rabbit anti-
CML, Abcam) diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer with 4 mM CaCl2
overnight at 4 �C. After washing, secondary antibodies (goat anti
rabbit IgG, Santa Cruz, sc-2004) were added at 1:2000 in blocking
buffer and incubated with membranes for 1 h at room temperature.
Membranes were developed by same methods as Western Blotting.
2.8. Gene expression analysis by real-time PCR
Microglia treated by CML and MBH tissues isolated from chow or
HCHF1 diet-fed mice were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA
was isolated and purified with RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). cDNA was
synthesized by Superscript III 1st Strand Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen).
Real-time PCR was applied with TaqMan� probes (Applied Bio-
systems). NCBI reference sequences of the target genes for RT-PCR
are
TNF-alpha:
NM013693,
IL-1beta:
NM008361.3,
RAGE:
NM001271422.l,
ALCAM:
NM009655.2,
HPRT:
NM013556.2.
Expression levels of each gene were normalized to housekeeping
genes HPRT, relative expression of the targeted gene was pre-
sented as fold change compared to the control group that was set
at 1.
2.9. Analytical methods
For measuring hypothalamic eicosanoids and sterols, mice were
euthanized in CO2 rapidly and transcardially perfused with PBS to flush
out blood, MBH tissues were then isolated and snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen. Hypothalamic eicosanoids and sterols were measured by
liquid-chromatography e mass spectrometric (LC-MS) method [9].
2.10. Statistics
All data are expressed as means � s.e.m. Statistical analyses were
performed using Prism5.0 (GraphPad). Two tailed Student t-test, one-
way, or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to test for
differences between individual experimental groups.

 3. RESULTS
3.1. A high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet, but not low-carbohydrate,
high-fat diet, induces obesity and increases the hypothalamic
inflammatory response.
To dissect the effects of fat and carbohydrates in a hypercaloric diet on
hypothalamic microglial activity, we fed 10 weeks old WT mice either a
standard chow diet, which is a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet, or one
of the following four high-fat diets with either high or low amounts of
carbohydrate and ample protein (Table 1). The two high-carbohydrate,
high-fat diets contained either sucrose (HCHF1) or starch (HCHF2) as
the carbohydrate source. The two low-carbohydrate, high-fat diets
were a non-ketogenic Atkins-style diet (LCHF1), as is often used for
dieting purposes with very low carbohydrate content but normal pro-
tein and high in fat [10,11], and a ketogenic low-carbohydrate, high-fat
diet (LCHF2). The fats in the HCHF1 diet were soybean oil and coconut
oil, the fat in the HCHF2, LCHF1, and LCHF2 diet was beef tallow [12].
Moreover, LCHF2 has lower dietary protein content as compared to
LCHF1 and this type of diet is often used for treatment of pediatric
epilepsy [11,13,14]. All five diets were fed ad libitum for 4 wk.
In comparison to the chow group, all four HF diet groups had signifi-
cantly higher daily caloric intake, being highest in the HCHF2 group
(Figure 1A). HCHF1 and HCHF2 groups equally gained the most BW in
each of the 4 wk, while the LCHF1 group gained less, the difference
reaching statistical significance vs. chow in wk4 (Figure 1B and C,
Supplemental Figure 1A). In contrast, mice fed with LCHF2 lost BW in
all 4 wk. Compared to the chow group, all four HF diet groups gained
significantly more fat mass (Figure 1D, Supplemental Figure 1B) and
thus had proportionally less lean mass than the chow group
(Supplemental Figure 1D and E). Plasma leptin levels of all HF diets
group were increased and reached significance in HCHF1, HCHF2, and
LCHF2 diet groups; moreover, the leptin level in the LCHF2 group was
significantly lower than that in the HCHF1 and HCHF2 groups
(Supplemental Figure 1C).
To investigate dietary impact on CNS components of the systemic
meta-inflammation known to associate with obesity, we evaluated
hypothalamic microglial and astrocyte activities after 4 wk. Mice fed
either HCHF diet had significantly increased cell number of the
microglial activity marker, ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1
(iba1-ir) in the ARC (Figure 1E and I). Furthermore, the HCHF1 and
HCHF2 groups had the highest level of cell coverage of iba1-ir
microglia (Figure 1 F), and although LCHF1 also showed an in-
crease, it was significantly lower than that of the two HCHF groups.
Similar findings between LCHF1 and LCHF2 groups point toward a
minor role of the dietary protein content in HF diets with respect to
hypothalamic microglial and astrocyte activities. The changes in iba1-ir
were not associated with the hypothalamic eicosanoids or sterols that
have been reported to be important inflammatory mediators in pe-
ripheral tissues [15] (Supplementary Figures 2 and 3). Thus, although
mice fed the LCHF diets consumed a similar high amount of fat as the
HCHF mice, the lack of carbohydrates in the diets was associated with
hypothalamic microglia remaining in a quiescent state. Intriguingly, the
immunoreactivity of the astrocytic marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP-ir), significantly increased in all four high-fat diets groups
(Figure 1G and J). Thus, in a hypercaloric environment, a high amount
of dietary fat per se seems to be a prerequisite to influence hypo-
thalamic astrocytic reactivity.
3.2. A HCHF diet increases N-epsilon-(carboxymethyl)lysine
content in POMC and NPY neurons in the ARC
The association between the two HCHF diets, but not between the two
LCHF diets, and the ARC microglial reactivity raised the question of which
non-high-fat factors are involved in the HCHF-induced microglial acti-
vation. It is known that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are
modifications of proteins that become non-enzymatically glycated and
oxidized after contactwithaldosesugars[16]. IncreasedlevelsofAGEs in
hyperglycemic conditions in diabetes are believed to play a major role in
vascular pathogenesis. To investigate whether the HCHF diet-induced-
hypothalamic inflammatory response is associated with AGEs in the
ARC, we measured the content of one of the major types of AGEs, N-
epsilon-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), that can be produced by both
glycoxidation and lipoxidation reactions [17]. First of all, among different
cell populations in the mediobasal hypothalamus, we found that CML-ir
was only observed in neurons (Supplementary Figure 4A), and not in
iba1-ir microglia, GFAP-ir astrocytes,or endothelial cells(Supplementary
Figure 4BeD). Secondly, in comparison to the chow group, all four high-
fatdietgroupscontained significantly more CMLimmunoreactivity(CML-
ir) in the ARC (Figure 1H and K). The HCHF1 and HCHF2 groups had
significantly more CML-ir than the LCHF1 and LCHF2 groups, indicating
that the combination of high fat and high carbohydrate has the greatest
impact on CML content in the hypothalamic ARC. Consistent with the
increased CML-ir in the ARC, we also detected increases of a variety of
CML-modified proteins in the HCHF1 and/or HCHF2 diet-fed mouse
hypothalami (Supplementary Figure 5A). Furthermore, we also found
significant increases of another major AGE species e the methylglyoxal
(MG-H1) modifiedproteinse in theHCHF1 and/orHCHF2 diet-fedmouse
hypothalamus(SupplementaryFigure 5B), suggesting ageneralincrease
of major AGEs species on HCHF diets.
No significant differences were identified between the HCHF1 and
HCHF2 diets in terms of their impacts on food intake, BW, hypotha-
lamic iba1-ir, and CML-ir, implying that there were no major differ-
ences between sucrose-derived and starch-derived carbohydrates
regarding their effects on obesity and the hypothalamic inflammatory
response. Therefore, in the following experiments, we used the HCHF1
diet to assess the impact of CML on energy metabolism.
To further examine the CML content in POMC and NPY neurons in the
ARC, we fed POMC-EGFP or NPY-EGFP promoter transgenic mice with
HCHF1 diet for one month and compared them to mice that were fed
chow. On chow, both POMC and NPY neurons contained CML-ir (18%
of POMC neurons and 24% of NPY neurons) (Figure 2A, C and E). After
4 wk of HCHF diet, CML-ir was significantly increased in both POMC
(49%) and NPY neurons (45%) (Figure 2B, D and E), implying that the
HCHF diet has a similar impact on stimulating CML production in both
POMC and NPY neurons.
3.3. Hypothalamic non-neuronal cells express receptors for AGEs
AGEs induce tissue dysfunction by receptor-dependent mechanisms
[18]. By far-western blotting analysis, we found that CML binds to the

leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) that shares the same
genomic organization as RAGE in the gene fragment coding for the
cytoplasmic domain [19]. In comparison to chow-fed mice, the HCHF
diet fed mice had a significant increase of ALCAM and RAGE gene
expression (Figure 3B).
By detecting the GFP that was incorporated in the construct for
knocking out the RAGE gene (RAGE�/�) or the ALCAM gene (ALCAM�/
�), we were able to examine the cell populations expressing these two
receptors. Besides its known expression in endothelial cells [20], RAGE
was exclusively expressed in every microglial cell (Figure 3CeF), but
not in neuronal cells (including the POMC neurons; Supplementary
Figure 6A and B) or astrocytes (Supplementary Figure 6C). Treating
primary cultured hypothalamic microglia with CML significantly stim-
ulated tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) gene expression (Figure 3G).
Consistently, infusion of CML into the mediobasal hypothalamic area
for 6 h significantly increased iba1-ir microglia, identifying CML as a
stimulatory factor for microglial reactivity (Figure 3HeJ).
In contrast to RAGE, ALCAM was not expressed by microglia
(Supplementary Figure 7A) and was only partially expressed by endo-
thelial cells (Figure 3K and L). Also, ALCAM was not found on neurons
(including CML-ir neurons, Supplementary Figure 7B and C) or the
GFAP-ir astrocytes (Supplementary Figure 7D). Instead, ALCAM was
intensely expressed by all the PDGFRb-ir pericytes (Figure 3M and N).
Pericytes are the major cell population expressing PDGFRb. It is known
that PDGF-B, the endogenous ligand of PDGFRb, is highly expressed by

 microglia [21] and has an important role in regulating retinal capillary
physiology [22]. These data indicate that CML might influence
microglial PDGF-B production and, consequently, affect pericyte
function via the PDGF-B receptor PDGFRb. However, although we
observed that CML stimulated TNFa gene expression in microglia, we
did not see changes in PDGF-B gene expression (Figure 3F), indicating
that PDGF-B might not be involved in microglialepericyte interactions
in the HCHF-diet condition.
3.4. Obesity and metabolic symptoms induced by a HCHF diet are
improved in mice lacking functional RAGE and ALCAM genes
The evidence presented above suggests that under physiological
conditions, CML secreted from neurons into the microenvironment in
the mediobasal hypothalamus might be locally scavenged and taken
up by microglia and/or pericytes. When the metabolic system is
challenged by a HCHF diet, increased CML production by neurons
requires a sufficient clearance by “supporting cells” in the microen-
vironment, in particularly the microglia and/or pericytes, these may
exert stimulatory effects on the inflammatory response in microglia
and/or pericytes, which, in turn, affect neuronal function and the
control of energy metabolism.
To investigate whether RAGE and/or ALCAM mediates HCHF diet-
induced microglial activation and angiopathy in obesity [2,4,23], we
fed RAGE�/�, ALCAM�/�, or RAGE-ALCAM�/� mice a chow or HCHF
diet (in all mice the HCHF started at 10 weeks of age) and examined
their metabolic phenotype and hypothalamic inflammatory responses.
On chow diet, RAGE�/�, ALCAM�/� or RAGE-ALCAM�/� mice did not
differ from their WT controls with respect to food intake and BW gain
(Figure 4AeD and Figure 5A and B). When fed with HCHF diet, RAGE�/
�, ALCAM�/� and RAGE-ALCAM�/� mice had decreased food intake
(Figure 4A and C and Figure 5A). BW gain was significantly reduced
from wk14 to wk16 in RAGE�/� mice and in wk12 and from wk14 to
wk16 in ALCAM�/� mice (Figure 4B and D). Interestingly, BW gain in
RAGE-ALCAM�/� mice was already significantly lower than that in
RAGE-ALCAMþ/þ mice by wk1 and continued through wk4 of the
HCHF diet. This significant difference disappeared from wk6 to wk8,
due to an increased BW gain in RAGE-ALCAM�/� mice but was present
again from wk9 to wk16 (Figure 5B) and was associated with a lower
fat and lean mass than in WT mice in wk16 (Figure 5C). Glucose
tolerance did not differ between WT and RAGE-ALCAM�/� mice fed a
chow diet (Figure 5D). In contrast, HCHF diet-induced glucose intol-
erance seen in WT mice was significantly improved in the RAGE-

 ALCAM�/� mice (Figure 5E). These data indicate that deletion of both
RAGE and ALCAM genes was required to fully block the effects of AGEs
on energy metabolism, while lack of either of these two genes only
resulted in mild blockage effects.
3.5. Lacking RAGE and ALCAM prevents the hypothalamic
inflammatory response and angiogenesis that occur on a HCHF diet
To determine whether lack of RAGE and/or ALCAM impacts microglia,
pericytes, or the vasculature, we examined these cell populations in
the ARC of RAGE�/�, ALCAM�/� and RAGE-ALCAM�/� mice fed chow
or HCHF diet. Consistent with previous findings [2,3,23], microglial cell
number and cell coverage indicated by iba1-ir in the ARC was
significantly increased on the HCHF diet in both WT and KO control
group (Figure 4E, I and Figure 6A, B). In RAGE�/� mice, the number of
iba1-ir cells in the ARC showed significant reduction relative to WT
mice on the HCHF diet (Figure 4E) but remained significant higher than
in the KO mice on chow diet, indicating that microglia reactivity is
stimulated not only by the AGEs-RAGE pathway. No changes were
apparent in ALCAM�/� mice on either diet (Figure 4I), but the increase
in iba1-ir cell number did reach significance in the RAGE-ALCAM�/�
mice fed HCHF diet (Figure 6A, F), although the iba1-ir cell coverage
did not differ between the WT and RAGE-ALCAM�/� mice on HCHF
diet. These data indicate that RAGE and ALCAM are direct or indirect
mediators of CML (and other AGE species) action on microglial reac-
tivity, and that deletion of both receptors can effectively block the HCHF
diet-induced microglial activation.
In RAGE�/� mice, the number of PDGFRb-ir cells increased from chow
to HCHF diet, indicating that pericytes were activated upon taking up
CML (and other AGE species). In ALCAM�/� mice, the number of
PDGFRb-ir cells decreased from WT to KO in HCHF diet fed mice,
indicating lack of ALCAM can decrease pericytes activity on a HCHF
diet. In RAGE-ALCAM�/� mice, the number of PDGFRb-ir cells
decreased from WT to KO mice, indicating that the lack of both RAGE
and ALCAM reduces pericyte activity in chow and HCHF fed conditions
(Figure 4F, J and Figure 6C and G).
From a canonical view, RAGE and/or ALCAM expressed by endothelial
cells are responsible for taking up CML (and other AGE species) from
the circulation. In the mediobasal hypothalamus, the intense interac-
tion between neurons, glia and vasculature raises the possibility that
CML produced locally may act on endothelial cells. We examined
vessel length based on the previous observation that HCHF diets can
induce neovasculature formation [4]. In all WT mice, increased vessel

 length and vascular density were apparent in all the HCHF groups
(Figure 4G, H, K, L and Figure 6D, E, H, I). These increases were
completely abolished in RAGE-ALCAM�/� mice, indicating that RAGE
and ALCAM coordinately mediate the CML action on vasculature.
4. DISCUSSION
Regarding the respective roles of fat and carbohydrate in hypercaloric
environment-induced obesity, there is evidence to suggest that high-
fat diets, particularly diets containing saturated fats [24], promote
obesity and the associated metabolic syndrome. Evidence indicating a
pivotal role for high sugar diets has also been presented [25], but
remains controversial [26]. The present experiments provide clear
evidence that the amount of carbohydrate in a diet determines whether
a high-fat diet will induce obesity, or not.
The HCHF diet induced microglial activation is likely due to resident
microglial proliferation, since a recent study on hypothalamic inflam-
mation showed that microglia expansion in the hypothalamus requires

 the adequate presence of both fats and carbohydrates, a very high-fat
with very low-carbohydrate diet did not affect microglial proliferation
[27].
The obesity induced by HCHF diets was associated with a significant
increase of microglial reactivity and CML content in POMC and NPY
neurons. Because the two receptors that can bind CML are not
expressed by neurons but are expressed by microglia and endothelial
cells or pericytes, we conclude that in the local microenvironment,
microglia, pericytes, and endothelial cells are the CML (and other AGEs
species)-responsive cells. This conclusion is supported by the reduc-
tion of reactivity in microglia and pericytes, and the reduced neo-
vasculature formation in the hypothalamic ARC of RAGE and ALCAM
knockout mice fed a HCHF diet. The concurrent amelioration of HCHF-
induced obesity and metabolic disorders suggests that CML might be
one of the key mediators of HCHF diet-induced obesity via a medi-
obasal hypothalamic inflammatory response governed by microglia in
association with pericytes and vasculature.
Our data suggest that different high fat diets generate different levels
and types of AGEs. In a previous study on RAGE regulating metabolic
and inflammatory responses to a high fat diet, genetic deletion of the
RAGE gene largely prevented a lard based 60% high fat diet-induced
obesity [28]. This indicates that certain amounts and types of AGEs
probably act selectively on either RAGE or ALCAM. Future studies are
needed to understand how each type of AGE interacts with RAGE and/
or ALCAM.
CML produced by lipid peroxidation and non-enzymatic glycoxidation
reactions is considered an oxidative stress marker [29]. A previous
study reported that oxidative stress-induced reactive oxygen species
(ROS) are elevated in diet-induced obese mouse POMC and NPY/AgRP
neurons [30]. In the current study, we also observed CML in both
POMC and NPY neurons. However, the fact that receptors for CML
binding are not expressed by neurons, but are highly expressed by
microglia and/or pericytes, indicates that for maintaining a healthy
microenvironment, the so-called glial-vascular supporting unit may be
an important initial step in helping neurons to clean up metabolic
debris. Studies in peripheral tissues, including liver and vessels, report
a similar mechanism; i.e., the cells that take up AGEs are mainly
endothelial cells and macrophages [31,32].

 Under physiological conditions, the immune response of microglia may
be sufficient to clear away most of the neuronal debris. However, in the
HCHF diet condition, the overload of lipids and glucose from the diet
results in excessive CML (and other AGE species) production in neu-
rons, the excessive amount of CML taken up by microglia will
concurrently increase microglial reactivity. It is likely that in the local
microenvironment, microglia are not the only cells able to take up CML;
the ALCAM-expressing pericytes may also play a role. As an essential
component of neurovasculature the role of pericytes in maintaining
internal brain homeostasis has gained more and more attention since
these cells were found to express the macrophage scavenger receptor
[33] and to be important players in the pro-inflammatory response of
the brain to an immune challenge [34,35]. In the present study, the
identification of pericytes as a group of cells able to take up CML
confirmed the immune property of pericytes [36].
In the diet-induced obese mouse hypothalamus, astrocytosis has been
considered to be part of the hypothalamic inflammatory response to a
hypercaloric diet. We found that astrocytosis was mainly a response to
the fat but not to the carbohydrate content of the diet and was not
correlated to the dietary-induced changes in food intake and BW,
indicating that astrocytic activity might mainly be determined by lipid
metabolism. This concept also nicely fits with the fact that astrocytes
are considered to be the major source of ketone body production in the
brain [37].
Based on the current evidence, we propose that endothelial cells, in
addition to taking up the CML (and other AGE species) through RAGE,
can also accomplish this via ALCAM. When CML and other AGE species
are increased as a result of HCHF diet consumption, endothelial cells
need to enhance their uptake capacity. In the long run, this increasing
amount of CML (and other AGE species) may cause endothelial cellular
dysfunction and lead to neovasculature formation in the hypothalamic
ARC in HCHF diet-induced obesity, as we have reported in our previous
study [4]. The present findings demonstrate that RAGE and ALCAM
signaling pathways mediate the angiopathy effects of a HCHF diet in
the hypothalamic ARC via CML and other AGE species. In line with our
findings, other studies have observed that in diabetic retinopathy, an
accumulation of CML around vessels in the retina was associated with
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), suggesting that CML could
also play a role in VEGF expression in retinopathy and associated
microvascular complications [38].
We propose a model for the hypothalamic neuron-glia-vascular unit in
which, under physiological conditions, a basal level of CML (and other
AGE species)-modified macromolecules is secreted by neurons into the
interstitial space, and microglia are the primary cells responsible for
cleaning up these CML-modified macromolecules. The perivascular
pericytes most likely play a substitutive role in assisting microglia and
endothelial cells to take up the excessive amounts of modified CML
macromolecules. When, driven by a HCHF diet, CML (and other AGE
species) are over-produced in neurons, and the uptake of CML-
modified macromolecules is enhanced in microglia. This results in
microglial activation and production of more TNFa, by RAGE signaling,
that subsequently reinforces microglial activity and the inflammatory
response. In addition, through ALCAM signaling, this may also lead to
pericyte reactivity. Thus, in the local microenvironment, a dynamic
clearance system for neuronal debris is developed by microglia and
pericytes.
5. CONCLUSIONS
Calorie restriction is one of the major approaches to combat obesity
and its associated metabolic disorders. The evidence we provide here
indicates that restricting dietary fat is not the only factor that needs to
be considered for body weight reduction in obese individuals and that
dietary carbohydrates might substantially gate the efficiency of calorie
restriction for body weight reduction, via a hypothalamic mechanism.
Furthermore, it is known that inflammatory mechanisms play a crucial
role in neurodegenerative disorders and that the elimination of dietary
carbohydrates exerts a neuro-protective effect by alleviating symptoms
in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease [39,40]. Whether the neuro-
protective effects of low carbohydrate diets in these pathologies are
also mediated by microglial mechanisms needs to be explored in future
studies.
