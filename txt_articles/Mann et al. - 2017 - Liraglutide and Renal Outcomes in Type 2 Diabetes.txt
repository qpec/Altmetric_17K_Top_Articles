BACKGROUND
In a randomized, controlled trial that compared liraglutide, a glucagon-like pep-
tide 1 analogue, with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardio-
vascular risk who were receiving usual care, we found that liraglutide resulted in 
lower risks of the primary end point (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal 
stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes) and death. However, the long-term 
effects of liraglutide on renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes are un-
known.
METHODS
We report the prespecified secondary renal outcomes of that randomized, con-
trolled trial in which patients were assigned to receive liraglutide or placebo. The 
secondary renal outcome was a composite of new-onset persistent macroalbumin-
uria, persistent doubling of the serum creatinine level, end-stage renal disease, or 
death due to renal disease. The risk of renal outcomes was determined with the 
use of time-to-event analyses with an intention-to-treat approach. Changes in the 
estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria were also analyzed.
RESULTS
A total of 9340 patients underwent randomization, and the median follow-up of 
the patients was 3.84 years. The renal outcome occurred in fewer participants in 
the liraglutide group than in the placebo group (268 of 4668 patients vs. 337 of 
4672; hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67 to 0.92; P 
= 
0.003). This 
result was driven primarily by the new onset of persistent macroalbuminuria, 
which occurred in fewer participants in the liraglutide group than in the placebo 
group (161 vs. 215 patients; hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.91; P 
= 
0.004). The 
rates of renal adverse events were similar in the liraglutide group and the placebo 
group (15.1 events and 16.5 events per 1000 patient-years), including the rate of 
acute kidney injury (7.1 and 6.2 events per 1000 patient-years, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS
This prespecified secondary analysis shows that, when added to usual care, lira-
glutide resulted in lower rates of the development and progression of diabetic 
kidney disease than placebo. (Funded by Novo Nordisk and the National Institutes 
of Health; LEADER ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01179048.)

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
P
ersons with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
particularly those with evidence of cardio-
vascular disease, are at high risk for chron-
ic kidney disease.1,2 In most countries, diabetic 
kidney disease is reported to be the leading 
cause of dialysis-dependent chronic kidney dis-
ease.3 Efforts to blunt the global increase in the 
prevalence of end-stage renal disease therefore 
include the prevention of new-onset diabetic 
nephropathy and the prevention of progression 
of established diabetic nephropathy.
Improved glycemic control has been shown to 
reduce the occurrence of early diabetic nephrop-
athy.4-7 In patients with established diabetic ne-
phropathy, blood-pressure control and inhibition 
of the renin–angiotensin system are pivotal to 
slowing a progressive reduction in the glomeru-
lar filtration rate.8
Some glucose-lowering agents appear to have 
glucose-independent effects on diabetic nephrop-
athy and its progression. Data from studies in-
vestigating the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) in-
hibitor linagliptin and the human glucagon-like 
peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogue liraglutide, as well as 
sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibi-
tors, suggest that these drugs exert beneficial ef-
fects in experimental models of kidney injury.9-11 
However, in long-term studies, no clinically mean-
ingful benefits on renal outcomes have emerged 
with these medications as compared with pla-
cebo, except for a convincing benefit among 
patients who have received the SGLT2 inhibitor 
empagliflozin.11
In short-term studies, liraglutide improved gly-
cemic control, reduced urinary albumin excre-
tion, and increased urinary sodium excretion.12,13 
However, the long-term effects of liraglutide on 
the development and progression of diabetic kid-
ney disease are unknown. The Liraglutide Effect 
and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovas-
cular Outcome Results (LEADER) trial recently 
showed lower risks of cardiovascular outcomes, 
death from any cause, and microvascular out-
comes with liraglutide than with placebo.14 The 
lower risk of microvascular outcomes was driven 
by renal outcomes. Therefore, we report here the 
results of a prespecified analysis of the effects of 
liraglutide on renal outcomes.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
The trial design and methods have been pub-
lished previously.15 The trial protocol, available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org, was 
approved by the institutional review board or 
ethics committee at each participating center, 
and all the patients provided written informed 
consent. In brief, in this double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial, patients with type 2 diabetes 
and a high risk of cardiovascular disease were 
randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive lira-
glutide or matching placebo, in addition to usual 
care. The disposition of the trial participants has 
been published previously.15 Given the regulatory 
request to provide data on the use of liraglutide 
in patients with stage 4 chronic kidney disease 
(estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR], 15 to 
<30 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface 
area), approximately 220 such patients were in-
cluded in the trial. The minimum planned fol-
low-up of the patients receiving the trial regimen 
was 42 months, and the maximum planned follow-
up was 60 months, with an additional 30 days of 
follow-up after the trial regimen was completed.
All the authors had access to the final trial 
results and vouch for the fidelity of the trial to 
the protocol. The first two authors drafted the 
manuscript of this article, which was revised 
and approved by all the authors, who also vouch 
for the accuracy and completeness of the data 
and analyses reported.
Microvascular and Renal Outcomes
The prespecified secondary microvascular out-
come was a composite of renal and retinal out-
comes.15 In this article, we focus on the renal 
outcomes, which were more common than the 
retinal events (Table S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available at NEJM.org). The composite 
renal outcome consisted of new-onset persistent 
macroalbuminuria, persistent doubling of the 
serum creatinine level and an estimated GFR of 
45 ml or less per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-
surface area (hereafter referred to as persistent 
doubling of the serum creatinine level), the need 
for continuous renal-replacement therapy (end-

Liraglutide and Renal Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes
stage renal disease) with no reversible cause of 
the renal disease, or death from renal disease. 
Macroalbuminuria was defined as a concentration 
of more than 300 mg of albumin in a 24-hour 
urine sample or as a concentration of more than 
300 mg of albumin per gram of creatinine in a 
first morning sample. To confirm the presence 
of persistent macroalbuminuria or doubling of 
the serum creatinine level, a second measure-
ment was mandatory.
Renal outcomes were ascertained every 12 
months and at the end of the trial. All the above-
mentioned renal outcomes were adjudicated by 
an independent committee of experts who were 
unaware of the trial-group assignments, as de-
scribed previously.14,15 Additional nonadjudicated 
renal outcomes and adverse-event reporting are 
described in the Supplementary Methods section 
in the Supplementary Appendix.
Laboratory Assessments
Laboratory tests were performed centrally (at ICON 
in Warrington, PA). Creatinine levels (both uri-
nary and serum) were measured enzymatically, 
calibrated to isotope dilution mass spectrometry 
values (Roche–Hitachi), and the urinary albumin 
concentration was assessed by means of immu-
noprecipitation (Roche–Hitachi). The serum cre-
atinine level and the albumin-to-creatinine ratio 
were measured and calculated at randomization, 
annually, and at trial completion; the serum 
creatinine level was also measured at month 6. 
The GFR was estimated with the four-compo-
nent Modification of Diet in Renal Disease for-
mula, as specified in the trial protocol.16 Micro-
albuminuria (or a high urinary albumin level) 
was defined as a concentration of 30 to 300 mg 
of albumin per gram of creatinine, and macro-
albuminuria (or a very high urinary albumin 
level) as a concentration of more than 300 mg of 
albumin per gram of creatinine. If the urinary al-
bumin measurements were below the lower limit 
of quantification (5 mg per liter), a value of 2.5 mg 
per liter was imputed for statistical analysis.
Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis plan is available with the 
protocol,14 and additional details are provided in 
the Supplementary Methods section in the Sup-
plementary Appendix. In this secondary analysis, 
the required sample size was based on the pri-
mary cardiovascular outcome.15 Although the trial 
was not powered for renal outcomes, we calcu-
lated post hoc that the trial had 85% power to 
detect a risk of the composite renal outcome that 
was 22% lower in the liraglutide group than in 
the placebo group. Renal outcomes were not 
included in the hierarchical testing strategy that 
was used for the primary cardiovascular out-
come. All the analyses were performed at the 
nominal alpha level of 0.05 without correction 
for multiple hypothesis testing.
In prespecified time-to-event analyses we ap-
plied a Cox proportional-hazards model with 
trial group as a covariate. Sensitivity analyses 
were performed with death as a competing risk. 
All the patients who underwent randomization 
were included and followed from the time of 
randomization until death or the end of follow-
up, whichever came first.
Prespecified between-group comparisons were 
performed at 36 months, which was the last 
trial visit at which laboratory testing was per-
formed at the same time point in the entire 
population. We estimated trial-group ratios for 
the estimated GFR and the urinary albumin-to-
creatinine ratio using a mixed-effects model for 
repeated measures on log-transformed values (see 
the Supplementary Methods section in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). Subgroups of patients who 
were at increased renal risk (according to the es-
timated GFR and urinary albumin-to-creatinine 
ratio at baseline) were defined before unblinding.
Results
Trial Population
A total of 9340 patients underwent randomiza-
tion, with 4668 patients being assigned to re-
ceive liraglutide and 4672 to receive placebo. The 
median follow-up of the patients was 3.84 years, 
and the mean percentage of time that patients 
were taking the trial regimen was 83.0%.
The characteristics of the patients at baseline 
were generally balanced between the trial groups

dix). The mean age of the patients was 64 years, 
and the mean blood pressure 136/77 mm Hg. 
The mean estimated GFR was 80 ml per minute 
per 1.73 m2; a total of 20.7% of the patients had 
an estimated GFR of 30 to 59 ml per minute per 
1.73 m2, and 2.4% had an estimated GFR of less 
than 30 ml per minute per 1.73 m2. Microalbu-
minuria and macroalbuminuria, as assessed at 
randomization, were present in 26.3% and 10.5% 
of the patients, respectively. A total of 8632 pa-
tients received antihypertensive agents, and 7741 
received renin–angiotensin system blockers.
Composite Renal Outcome
The prespecified composite renal outcome oc-
curred in fewer patients in the liraglutide group 
than in the placebo group (268 patients [5.7%] vs. 
337 [7.2%]; hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.67 to 0.92; P 
= 
0.003) (Table 1 and 
Fig. 1A). New-onset persistent macroalbumin-
uria occurred in fewer patients in the liraglutide 
group than in the placebo group (161 patients 
[3.4%] vs. 215 [4.6%]; hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 
0.60 to 0.91; P 
= 
0.004) (Fig. 1B). The risks of 
persistent doubling of the serum creatinine level 
and of end-stage renal disease (use of renal-
replacement therapy) did not differ significantly 
between groups (Table 1 and Fig. 1C and 1D). 
There were few cases of death due to renal dis-
ease (8 patients in the liraglutide group and 5 in 
the placebo group).
Sensitivity analyses, in which death from any 
cause was considered to be a competing risk, 
yielded similar results (Table S4 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Similarly, analyses that took 
into account the differences between groups in 
the use of inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin 
system, the glycated hemoglobin level, body 
weight, and blood pressure did not materially 
alter the results (Tables S5 through S8 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Composite Renal Outcome in Subgroups
The prespecified subgroups of patients with an 
elevated renal risk at baseline included 3422 
patients with microalbuminuria or macroalbu-
minuria, 2158 with an estimated GFR of less 
than 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m2, and 1130 
with both an estimated GFR of less than 60 ml 
per minute per 1.73 m2 and microalbuminuria or 
macroalbuminuria (Fig. 2, and Table S9 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The effect of liraglu-
tide on the composite renal outcome appeared to 
be independent of subgroups (Fig. 2). In the 
subgroup of patients with microalbuminuria or 
macroalbuminuria, the composite renal outcome 
occurred in fewer patients in the liraglutide 
group than in the placebo group (230 of 1684 
patients [13.7%] vs. 283 of 1738 [16.3%]; hazard 
ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.96; P 
= 
0.02). In the

less than 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m2, the

patient who had macroalbuminuria at baseline had an event of new-onset persistent macroalbuminuria that was confirmed by adjudication 
after the patient had regression to microalbuminuria earlier in the trial.

Liraglutide and Renal Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes
composite renal outcome occurred in 146 of 
1116 patients (13.1%) in the liraglutide group 
and in 156 of 1042 (15.0%) in the placebo group 
(hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.05; P 
= 
0.13). 
In patients with both an estimated GFR of less 
than 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 and microal-
buminuria or macroalbuminuria, the composite 
renal outcome occurred in 131 of 583 patients 
(22.5%) in the liraglutide group and in 141 of 
547 (25.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 
0.81; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.03; P 
= 
0.09).
Renal Function over Time
The estimated GFR declined continuously (Fig. 3A), 
but the decline was slightly slower in the liraglu-
tide group than in the placebo group (estimated 
trial-group ratio at 36 months, 1.02; 95% CI, 
1.00 to 1.03; P 
= 
0.01, corresponding to a 2% less 
decrease with liraglutide). The decrease in the 
estimated GFR at 36 months was 7.44 ml per 
minute per 1.73 m2 in the liraglutide group, as 
compared with 7.82 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 
in the placebo group. The urinary albumin-to-
Figure 1. Composite Renal Outcome and Components of the Composite Outcome.
The primary composite renal outcome in the time-to-event analysis was a composite (Panel A) of the first occurrence of persistent macro-
albuminuria (Panel B), persistent doubling of the serum creatinine level and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 45 ml or less per 
minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area (referred to as persistent doubling of the serum creatinine level; Panel C), the need for continu-
ous renal-replacement therapy (for end-stage renal disease; Panel D), or death due to renal disease (data not shown). The component of 
death due to renal disease occurred in 13 patients (8 patients in the liraglutide group and 5 in the placebo group). Cumulative incidences 
were estimated with the use of the Kaplan–Meier method, and the hazard ratios were calculated with the use of the Cox proportional-
hazard regression model. The insets show the same data on an enlarged y axis. The data analyses are truncated at 54 months because 
less than 10% of the participants had an observation time beyond 54 months. All the events were adjudicated. One patient with macro-
albuminuria at baseline had an event of new-onset persistent macroalbuminuria that was confirmed by adjudication after the patient 
had regression to microalbuminuria earlier in the trial.

creatinine ratio increased less in the liraglutide 
group, yielding a 17% lower urinary albumin-to-
creatinine ratio at 36 months in favor of liraglu-
tide (estimated trial-group ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 
0.79 to 0.88; P<0.001) (Fig. 3B). The estimated 
increase in the urinary albumin-to-creatinine 
ratio at 36 months was 1.8 mg of albumin per 
gram of creatinine in the liraglutide group, as 
compared with 6.3 mg of albumin per gram of 
creatinine in the placebo group (Fig. 3B); in an 
analysis that excluded values outside the quanti-
fication range, the results were similar (Table 
S10A and S10B in the Supplementary Appendix). 
The smaller increase in albuminuria at 36 months 
in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group 
was independent of the baseline estimated GFR 
and baseline albuminuria (Table S10A and S10B 
and Fig. S1A and S1B in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
When results were stratified according to the 
estimated GFR at baseline, the decrease in the es-
timated GFR in patients with a baseline estimated 
GFR of 30 to 59 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 was 
2 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 in the liraglutide 
group, as compared with 4 ml per minute per 
1.73 m2 in the placebo group (estimated trial-
group ratio in favor of liraglutide, 1.07; 95% CI, 
1.04 to 1.10; P <0.001) (Fig. 4, and Fig. S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Results did not differ 
significantly between groups in patients with a 
baseline estimated GFR of 60 ml or more per 
minute per 1.73 m2 or with an estimated GFR of 
less than 30 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 (there 
were few patients in the latter group). When 
analyzed according to albuminuria at baseline, 
the decrease in the estimated GFR was smaller 
in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group 
in patients with macroalbuminuria (P 
= 
0.01) but 
did not differ significantly in those with micro-
albuminuria (P 
= 
0.24) or normoalbuminuria 
(P 
= 
0.60) (data not shown).
Other Outcomes and Adverse Events
Outcomes that were not prespecified included 
the composite of the doubling of the serum cre-
atinine level or the use of renal-replacement 
therapy; there were no significant differences 
between the randomized groups (Table S11 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). New-onset micro-
albuminuria occurred in fewer patients in the 
liraglutide group than in the placebo group 
(2293 patients [49.1%] vs. 2498 [53.5%]; hazard 
ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.93; P<0.001).
The rates of renal adverse events were similar 
Figure 2. Composite Renal Outcome, According to Baseline Renal Risk.
The estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated with the use of the Modification of Diet in Renal Dis-
ease formula. Hazard ratios and P values were estimated with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model with in-
teraction between trial group and renal risk at baseline. The composite renal outcome consisted of new-onset per-
sistent macroalbuminuria, persistent doubling of the serum creatinine level and an estimated GFR of 45 ml or less 
per minute per 1.73 m2, the need for continuous renal-replacement therapy (end-stage renal disease), or death due 
to renal disease.

Liraglutide and Renal Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes
in the liraglutide group and the placebo group 
(15.1 events and 16.5 events per 1000 patient-
years), including the rate of acute kidney injury 
(7.1 events and 6.2 events per 1000 patient-years, 
respectively), according to adverse-event report-
ing. The similarity in the rates of adverse events 
also applies to subgroups defined according to 
the estimated GFR at baseline. Details are pro-
vided in Table S12A and S12B in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix.
Discussion
Among patients who were receiving usual care, 
liraglutide resulted in significantly lower rates of 
renal outcomes than placebo among patients 
with type 2 diabetes who were at high cardiovas-
cular risk. This result was driven mainly by a 
lower incidence of macroalbuminuria in the lira-
glutide group than in the placebo group. There 
were nonsignificantly lower risks of the doubling 
of the serum creatinine level and of end-stage 
renal disease with liraglutide than with placebo 
during up to 5 years of follow-up.
New-onset persistent macroalbuminuria is an 
effect that is typically associated with subsequent 
progressive reductions in the GFR in patients 
with type 2 diabetes.17 For example, in ONTARGET 
(Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combina-
tion with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and 
TRANSCEND (Telmisartan Randomized Assess-
ment Study in ACE Intolerant Subjects with 
Cardiovascular Disease), new-onset macroalbu-
minuria was associated with a risk of end-stage 
renal disease or doubling of the serum creati-
nine level that was 3 to 5 times as high as the 
risk among patients in whom new-onset macro-
albuminuria did not develop.18 Similar renal out-
comes associated with new-onset macroalbu-
minuria were reported in the ADVANCE (Action 
in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and 
Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evalua-
tion) trial19 and supported by meta-regression 
analyses.17 Macroalbuminuria is also a risk fac-
tor for cardiovascular events.17,20
In this present trial, the risks of doubling of 
the serum creatinine level and end-stage renal 
disease did not differ significantly between the 
liraglutide group and the placebo group, possi-
bly owing to the moderate decline in the esti-
mated GFR observed in this cohort and the few 
patients who had advanced kidney disease at 
randomization. The initial changes in the esti-
mated GFR are difficult to interpret,21 but there 
may be a potential slowing in the reduction in 
the estimated GFR with liraglutide in patients 
with a low baseline estimated GFR.
The mechanism behind the effect of liraglu-
tide on the renal outcomes is unclear. Statistical

Ratio.
Panel A shows the estimated GFR, and Panel B the urinary albumin-to- 
creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine mea-
sured in grams). Geometric means were estimated for the urinary albumin-
to-creatinine ratio with the use of a linear mixed model for log-transformed 
assessment, with accounting for repeated measures. Trial-group ratios were 
estimated with the use of a mixed-effect model for repeated measures on 
log-transformed values. Interaction between visit and, respectively, trial 
group, sex, geographic region, and use of antidiabetic therapy at baseline 
were included as fixed effects, and interaction between visit and baseline 
log-estimated GFR or baseline urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio and age 
at baseline were included as covariates. The values for the urinary albumin-
to-creatinine ratio that were outside the range of quantification were imputed 
(see the Supplementary Methods section in the Supplementary  
Appendix).

baseline and during the trial did not materially 
alter the effect of liraglutide on renal outcomes. 
However, in a meta-analysis, intensified glucose 
control was associated with a lower incidence of 
new macroalbuminuria than was usual care.4 In 
the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study 
(UKPDS), a 1-percentage-point difference in the 
glycated hemoglobin level between groups was 
associated with a consistent benefit on micro-
vascular outcomes only, after 10 years of follow-
up.22 In the ACCORD (Action to Control Cardio-
vascular Risk in Diabetes) trial, a difference of 
0.8 percentage points in the glycated hemoglo-
bin level was associated with a much earlier 
benefit on macroalbuminuria but no change in 
the risks of doubling of the serum creatinine 
level or end-stage renal disease with 4 years of 
follow-up.23 The ADVANCE trial showed a differ-
ence of 0.8 percentage points in the glycated 
hemoglobin level and a substantial benefit with 
regard to new-onset albuminuria over a 5-year 
follow-up with no significant change in the risk 
of a doubling of the serum creatinine level but a 
tendency toward a lower risk of end-stage renal 
disease.24 Other large, randomized trials involv-
ing patients with type 2 diabetes have also re-
ported microvascular events.25-28 As in the pres-
ent trial, these trials have shown between-group 
differences in the glycated hemoglobin level of 
between 0.2 and 0.4 percentage points, and ben-
efits of active compounds on albuminuria, but 
not on other renal outcomes. In contrast, the 
EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial showed that empa-
gliflozin resulted in significantly lower risks

Liraglutide and Renal Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes
than placebo of progression to macroalbumin-
uria, the doubling of the serum creatinine level, 
and despite small numbers, end-stage renal 
disease.11,29
It appears to be unlikely that the moderate 
between-group differences in systolic blood pres-
sure and body weight can fully explain the effect 
on renal outcomes. In an analysis that took into 
account those differences, the composite renal 
outcome still occurred less frequently with lira-
glutide than with placebo. The mechanisms be-
hind the renal effects of liraglutide are probably 
multifactorial. Most studies investigating the 
effect of GLP-1 treatment on renal hemodynam-
ic variables in patients with type 2 diabetes have 
shown neutral effects.12,13 Preclinical studies have 
shown convincingly that GLP-1 therapy decreases 
the level of inflammation and oxidative stress 
and prevents diabetic nephropathy and acute 
kidney injury.10,30 Furthermore, a recent random-
ized trial involving patients with type 2 diabetes 
and albuminuria showed that liraglutide treat-
ment reduced levels of inflammatory biomark-
ers.31 Hence, it is possible that preservation of 
renal function and the antialbuminuric effects 
of liraglutide may be due to antiinflammatory 
effects rather than renal hemodynamic effects.
There are some limitations to the present 
analysis. Although the trial prespecified renal 
outcomes as secondary outcomes, it was not 
powered for analyses of the individual renal out-
comes. Also, patients were followed for 3.5 to 
5.0 years, and thus we cannot extrapolate to 
longer-term effects. The trial design prevents us 
from ascertaining the extent to which the active 
drug, glucose control, or other factors (including 
concomitant medications) explain outcomes. A 
significantly lower risk of renal outcomes was 
still observed when the analysis was adjusted for 
change in the glycated hemoglobin level, body 
weight, and blood pressure. That said, in the ab-
sence of head-to-head comparisons, other direct 
or indirect drug effects cannot be ruled out. 
Nonetheless, concomitant medications were more 
frequently added in the placebo group during 
the trial than in the liraglutide group.14
In conclusion, in this secondary analysis, 
among patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk 
for cardiovascular disease who were receiving 
usual care, liraglutide resulted in a lower risk of 
the composite renal outcome than placebo, pri-
marily owing to a lower rate of new-onset per-
sistent macroalbuminuria.
