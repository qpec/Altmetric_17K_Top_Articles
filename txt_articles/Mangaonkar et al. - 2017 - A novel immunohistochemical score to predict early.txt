Indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1) is an enzyme in the kynurenine pathway which augments 
tumor-induced immune tolerance. Previous studies in childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have 
shown a negative correlation of IDO-1 mRNA expression with outcomes. The aim of our study was to 
develop a practical and objective immunohistochemical technique to quantify IDO-1 expression on 
diagnostic bone marrow biopsies of AML patients in order to facilitate its use in routine clinical practice. 
IDO-1 mRNA was extracted from diagnostic bone marrow specimens from 29 AML patients. IDO-1 
protein expression was assessed in 40 cases via immunohistochemistry and quantified by a novel 
‘composite IDO-1 score’. In a univariate analysis, higher age (p = 0.0018), male gender (p = 0.019), 
high risk cytogenetics (p = 0.002), higher IDO-1 mRNA (p = 0.005), higher composite IDO-1 score 
(p < 0.0001) and not undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT, p = 0.0005) predicted poor overall 
survival. In a multivariate model that included the aforementioned variables, higher composite IDO-1 
score (p = 0.007) and not undergoing allogeneic SCT (p = 0.007) was found to significantly predict 
poor outcomes. Further, patients who failed induction had higher composite IDO-1 score (p = 0.01). In 
conclusion, ‘composite IDO-1 score’ is a prognostic tool that can help identify a certain subset of AML 
patients with ‘early mortality’. This unique subset of patients can potentially benefit from specific IDO-1 
inhibitor therapy, currently in clinical trials.
Indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO-1), an enzyme in the kynurenine pathway, plays a critical role in 
tumor-mediated immune tolerance1. It achieves this by catabolizing tryptophan, and by producing immuno-
modulatory kynurenine2. In addition to this, IDO-1 has been shown to have a non-enzymatic function as a 
‘signaling protein’ within plasmacytoid dendritic cells3. The importance of this enzyme in normal host immu-
nomodulatory processes is illustrated by the fact despite evolutionary forces; it is highly conserved in several 
animals, fungi and bacteria4. The potential role of IDO-1 in acquired immune tolerance was first suggested when 
inhibition of IDO in pregnant mice caused spontaneous immune rejection of allogeneic fetuses5. Since then, this 
immunomodulatory function of IDO-1 has been at least partially linked to disease progression and pathogene-
sis of certain chronic infections6,7, transplantation8,9, autoimmune diseases10,11 and malignancies such as breast

carcinoma12,13, endometrial carcinoma14, serous ovarian tumors, melanoma15, hepatocellular carcinoma16 and 
colonic adenocarcinoma17,18. In tumors, inhibition of the IDO pathway is theorized to help ameliorate a state of 
immune privilege created by tumor cells enhancing endogenous T-cell mediated response against the tumor17. 
In the case of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), preclinical studies in both adults and children have found a 
positive correlation of increased expression of IDO1 mRNA or functional activity in leukemic blasts correlated 
with worse overall survival (OS)19–21. This has prompted initiation of a clinical trial in which the IDO-pathway 
inhibitor indoximod will be combined with standard idarubicin/cytarabine chemotherapy in newly-diagnosed 
adult AML (NCT02835729). In adults, the subset of patients with by far the worst prognosis, fails to enter remis-
sion with induction chemotherapy. These patients often have a relentlessly downhill course despite best available 
therapy, and in certain high-risk populations such as elderly patients, over half will be dead within 6 months of 
diagnosis. This “early-mortality” subset represents a population that is in particularly urgent need of improved 
treatment. We hypothesized that the early-mortality population might represent patients with the highest IDO-1 
expression, and thus the candidates most in need of an IDO-inhibitor drug as a component of their treatment 
regimen. At present, however, there are only a few clinical scores to predict in advance which patients will fail 
induction22 and it would be useful to have other novel biomarkers such as IDO-1 to predict induction success or 
failure. We hypothesized that immunohistochemical staining of initial diagnostic bone-marrows biopsies for a 
combination of extent and intensity of IDO-1 staining might be used to generate an objective pathologic score of 
IDO-1 expression; and that this would allow accurate prospective identification of those patients at highest risk 
of induction-failure and early mortality.
Results
Clinical characteristics. 
Data from forty patients was included in the final analysis. Median age at diagnosis 
was 60 years (range: 27–89); with 16 males (40%); and 22 self-reporting Caucasian (55%). Cytogenetic and molec-
ular risk stratification included good in 3 patients (7.5%), intermediate in 32 patients (80%) and poor in 5 patients 
(12.5%). The French-American-British (FAB) classification distribution included M1 6 (15%), M2 5 (12.5%), M3 
1 (2.5%), M4 5 (12.5%), M5 8 (20%), M6 2 (5%) and AML secondary to MDS 11 (27.5%). Twenty-nine patients 
(72.5%) underwent standard anthracycline and cytarabine induction, while 4 (10%) were treated with hypometh-
ylating agents, and 7 (17.5%) untreated or treatment status unknown. Six patients (15%) underwent allogeneic 
stem cell transplant (SCT) and all of them were performed at the time of first complete remission (CR1). Twenty 
patients (50%) achieved remission, and among those 10 (25%) had subsequent relapse. Median overall survival 
(OS) was 283 days (range: 32–1941); with 8 alive (20%) at the time of data analysis. Table 1 provides a summary 
of patient and disease characteristics.
IDO-1 mRNA has a negative correlation with OS. 
IDO-1 mRNA expression (n = 29) was compared 
across the 4 different survival groups defined in Methods (Fig. 1A), with the highest levels in <6 month group 
(“early-mortality” group). Values were measured as per the fold change, with 18S as the housekeeping gene. 1.39, 
0.99, 0.36 and 0.31 were the respective fold change values in groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively.
IDO-1 protein expression has a negative correlation with OS. 
Analysis of IDO-1 protein expression 
by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (n = 40) also showed a similar statistical correlation. After a receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) analysis, a cut-off point of composite IDO-1 score was arrived at 0.45 and samples were 
divided into two groups: high (≥
0.45) and low (<0.45). Kaplan-Meir survival analysis highlights direct correla-
tion of poor survival with higher composite IDO-1 score (p = 0.0005, Fig. 1B,C). When patients were stratified 
by conventional risk categories, the highest composite IDO-1 score was seen in the poor risk category (median 
1.5, n = 9), followed by intermediate (median 0.6, n = 27) and good risk categories (median 0.13, n = 4, p = 0.005, 
Fig. 1D). Further, IDO-1 mRNA and protein expression had a positive correlation as assessed by one-way analysis 
of variance (ANOVA, p = 0.024).
Multivariate analysis proves composite IDO-1 score to be an independent prognostic factor. 
 
In a univariate model that included age, sex, race, body-mass index (BMI), allogeneic SCT, induction treatment 
strategy (standard cytarabine and anthracycline induction versus hypomethylating agents), remission achieved 
versus not, diagnostic peripheral and bone marrow blast percentage, only higher age (p = 0.0018), male gender 
(p = 0.019), high risk cytogenetics (p = 0.002), higher IDO-1 mRNA levels (p = 0.005), higher IDO-1 protein 
expression (as measure by composite IDO-1 score, p < 0.0001) and not undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant 
(SCT, p = 0.0005) all correlated with a poor OS. However in a multivariate model which included age, sex, alloge-
neic stem cell transplant, IDO-1 mRNA levels, composite IDO-1 score and risk category, only higher composite 
IDO-1 score (p = 0.003) and not undergoing allogeneic SCT (p = 0.007) remained significantly associated with 
poor OS (Table 2). Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model.
Induction failure was inversely correlated with composite IDO-1 score. 
One-way analysis of var-
iance (ANOVA) of composite IDO-1 score was compared with remission achieved with either one or multiple 
rounds of induction therapy (either with standard cytarabine and anthracycline induction versus hypometh-
ylating agents) and we found that patients who did not achieve remission had higher composite IDO-1 score 
(p = 0.01, Fig. 1E).
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data confirms the prognostic role of IDO-1. 
The importance of 
IDO1 as a prospective risk classifier was validated from the external TCGA AML database. High β
 median value 
of IDO-1 promoter methylation status correlated with worse OS (p = 6e-04). Survival analysis of the TCGA AML 
patients’ cohort based on IDO1 mRNA expression is shown in Fig. 2A and promoter methylation is shown in 
Fig. 2B.

Discussion
IDO-1 expression has been shown to affect survival in multiple tumors, including AML. Our study shows that 
increased IDO-1 mRNA and protein expression correlates with a lower OS. Importantly, increased IDO-1 expres-
sion in leukemic blasts at diagnosis, defined by a composite IDO-1 score performed on readily-available, archival 
diagnostic biopsies, correctly identified the subset of patients with highest risk of early mortality. In a multivariate 
model, high composite IDO-1 score at diagnosis was found to be an independent predictor of poor outcomes in 
AML.
In AML, tumor microenvironment is inherently hostile to immune effector cells19. IDO-1 is hypothesized 
to be a critical contributor to this phenomenon. Similar to our results, Chamuleau ME et al. showed that high 
IDO-1 mRNA in blasts was shown to correlate with poor outcomes20. Also, IDO-1 activity was shown to corre-
late with poor outcomes in children by Folgiero et al.19. Constitutive IDO-1 expression in AML blasts has been 
shown in about 50% of cases of AML, with the remaining half showing upregulation of IDO-1 mRNA after IFN-y 
stimulation19,21. Hara T et al. further confirmed the prognostic role of IDO-1 mRNA in combination serum 
L-kynurenine level23. Previous studies with allogeneic SCT suggest that immunologic mechanisms such as graft

versus leukemia immunity play a critical role in clearance of leukemic blasts. Therefore, it seems reasonable that 
inhibition of a potent immunosuppressive mechanism such as IDO-1 might further enhance this immunothera-
peutic effect and improve outcomes. The current study shows that it is possible to prospectively identify a subset 
of AML patients with the highest IDO-1 expression at the highest risk for early mortality. This may help as a com-
panion diagnostic approach to identify those patients most likely to benefit from the addition of IDO-inhibitor 
drugs to front-line therapy for AML.
Despite the fact that we used rigorous statistical modeling and an external cohort to validate our results, 
there are certain limitations of our analysis. Due to small sample size, it is possible that our multivariate analysis 
is underpowered. To address this limitation, we used an external cohort (TCGA) to confirm our results. Due 
to fewer numbers and the fact that all patients with allogeneic SCT were performed at CR1, survival data for 
this variable should be interpreted with caution. Mutational analysis was not used as whole or targeted exome

Materials and Methods
Patient samples. 
Fresh-frozen paraffin embedded (FFPE) diagnostic bone marrow biopsy specimens were 
retrospectively collected from forty AML patients after obtaining institutional review board (IRB) approval. 
Detailed clinical, laboratory and outcomes data was recorded. Risk categories were defined as per the 2010 
European Leukemia Net (ELN) classification system (due to limited numbers, intermediate-1 and 2 sub-catego-
ries were regrouped under one intermediate group)24. Messenger RNA (mRNA) was extracted from 29 specimens 
using a commercial kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s protocol, following which, IDO-1 gene expression 
was checked via real time quantitative PCR. IDO-1 protein expression was checked via immunohistochemistry 
in 40 specimens. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations of Augusta 
University and were approved by its ethical committee and IRB. Prior bone marrow biopsy specimens were used and 
do not require informed consent.
Reagents. 
Mouse monoclonal anti human IDO antibody (#M256) purchased from CalBioReagents (San 
Mateo, CA, USA). ABC kit (PK-6102) was from Vector lab (Burlington, CA, USA). AEC-Substrate (HK092-5K) 
from Biogenex (Fremont, CA). Faramount aqueous mounting medium (S 3025) and ready to use Proteinase K 
solution (S 3020) from DAKO (Carpintena, CA) was utilized.
RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis. 
For real time quantitation of IDO1 gene expression, total RNA was 
isolated from FFPE tissue blocks using Qiagen (QIAGEN Inc, Valencia, CA) mRNAeasy kit (217504) as per man-
ufacturer’s protocol. DNase treatment step during isolation of total RNA eliminated the residual DNA carryover. 
The quantity of the total RNA samples was determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, Thermo 
Scientific, and Pittsburgh, PA). Total RNA (200 ng) was reverse transcribed using iScript cDNA synthesis kit 
(170–8891) from BioRad laboratories (Hercules, CA).
Real time PCR. 
IDO-1 gene expression was measured by quantitative real time PCR using SYBR green 
chemistry (SYBR Green Supermix, BIO-RAD laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA) on a BIO-RAD RT-PCR system 
(MyiQ optic Model). Data was analyzed by ∆-∆CT method using 18S ribosomal transcript as endogenous con-
trol. Transcript specific oligonucleotide primers for real time PCR were designed. Primers were purchased from 
Integrated DNA Technology, Iowa. Following were the IDO-1 primers used: 5′
-TATGTGTGGGGCAAAGGT-3′
 
(forward primer) and 5′
-CTTGGAGAGTTGGCAGTAAGG-3′
 (reverse primer).
Composite IDO-1 Score. 
IDO-1 protein expression was quantified through IHC. Two slides were prepared 
for each of the 40 specimens, one for hematoxylin/eosin staining and the other for staining with IDO-1 antibody. 
IHC experiments were carried out on 4% FFPE tissues. 4 µm in thickness sections were deparaffinized in xylene 
and hydrated in water. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in distilled water for 
10 minute in room temperature (RT). Slides were rinsed with distilled water 3 times and then with Phosphate 
buffered saline with Tween 20 (PBST) for 5 minutes. Proteinase K pretreatment for 12 minutes at RT was done for 
Figure 2. TCGA database of AML patients downloaded from the UCSC website. (A) RNA seq and Illumina 
450 K methylation array data was obtained and the FKPM value was used to divide the external cohort into two 
groups for survival analysis. Higher FKPM >0 correlates with a poor OS (*p = 0.0072). (B) For methylation 
array data, one of the three CpG sites assigned to IDO-1 (*cg10262052) was used to divide the cohort into two 
groups based on the median β
-value. Higher median β
-values of IDO-1 promoter methylation correlated with 
better outcomes (*p = 6e-04).

antigen retrieval. Slides then washed one times with PBST and were blocked with 0.5% nonfat dry milk in PBST 
for 30 minutes at RT. For detection of IDO-1 protein expression, specimens were incubated overnight at +4° C 
with antimouse IDO-1 antibody in a 1:100 dilution. Visualization of bound antibodies was carried out using a 
streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex and 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole as chromogen. Normal breast FFPE sec-
tions were used as a negative control.
Percentage of mononuclear cells stained was noted and intensity of staining was graded as weak (1), moderate 
(2) or strong (3) by two independent pathologists (Fig. 3). Composite IDO-1 score was calculated by multiplying 
the grade of staining intensity by the percentage of stained mononuclear cells.
Survival Groups. 
For analysis, patients were divided into 4 survival groups, defined as: >5 years (n = 8, 
group 1), 1–5 years (n = 11, group 2), 6 months-1 year (n = 8, group 3) and <6 months (n = 13, group 4).
External cohort analysis. 
TCGA database of AML patients was downloaded from the University of 
California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) website. The RNA-seq and Illumina 450 K methylation array datasets are down-
loaded from the UCSC Cancer Genome Browser (https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu). The downloaded data are 
already processed and normalized by the UCSC Cancer Genome Browser team. The RNA-seq data are log2 trans-
formed FPKM values. We did not perform any further processing on the downloaded RNA-seq data. The meth-
ylation data downloaded from the UCSC cancer genome browser are β
-values subtracted by 0.5 and the values 
are between (−
0.5 and 0.5). We restored the data to β
-value by adding 0.5 to each data point. No other alteration 
was done to the methylation data set.
Statistical analysis. 
Data was analyzed through JMP Pro (Version 7) statistical software. Unpaired t tests 
were used as appropriate. One-way ANOVA was used to assess correlation between variables. Multivariate anal-
ysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. A p-value of 0.05 was considered significant and 
log-rank statistical test was used to derive the results. Data is available for verification.
