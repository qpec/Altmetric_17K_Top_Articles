Abstract
Background: Few representative sample studies have reported estimates of bullying and sexual abuse in Australia.
By using face-to-face interviews and self-labelling questions, we investigated the prevalence of these forms of
abuse and their relationship with current harmful behaviours (smoking dependence, excessive alcohol intake, binge
eating), antidepressant use, and the physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) components of health-related quality of life.
Methods: This study was a population-based survey that investigated 2873 South Australians in 2015 (48.8 ± 18.1
years; 49.3% males). Bullying and sexual abuse (age of onset and duration) and their outcomes were investigated
through household interviews. Associations were adjusted for sociodemographic variables by using regression models.
Results: 45.6% (95% CI 43.3–47.9) of the participants were bullied, and 10.4% (95% CI 9.1–11.9) sexually abused; 7.3%
(95% CI 6.2–8.5) reported experiencing both forms of abuse. Moreover, 15.8% of those bullied and 15.0% of those
sexually abused suffered from these forms of abuse for > 24 months. Smoking dependence (7.8%) was twice as
frequent among those who experienced bullying for > 24 months or when sexual abuse occurred in childhood
(< 10 years) or adulthood (20+ years) or lasted ≥1 month. Excessive alcohol intake (14.3%) was more frequent
when bullying occurred in childhood or lasted > 24 months. Binge eating (8.1%) was more frequent among those
bullied or sexually abused in adulthood, but duration did not show a clear pattern. Antidepressant use was up to
four times more likely, and PCS or MCS lower among those who were bullied or sexually abused, independent of
when these forms of abuse started or their duration. The cumulative adverse relationship of bullying and sexual
abuse with the investigated outcomes was more evident for smoking dependence, binge eating, PCS, and MCS
than for antidepressant use, but no association was observed with alcohol intake.
Conclusions: The use of self-labelling questions to investigate sensitive areas such as bullying and sexual abuse
in a survey is feasible. Such questions provided estimates that are consistent with findings from studies using
more detailed instruments. Bullying and sexual abuse have an additive adverse association with various
outcomes. Identifying survivors of both forms of abuse is important to avoid more serious consequences.

 Background
Childhood experiences of abuse have been associated
with long-term health consequences [1–6]. Childhood
sexual abuse is one of the most investigated forms of
maltreatment and has been identified as a modifiable
risk factor for mental disorders across the life course [7].
In terms of magnitude, sexual abuse is a global problem
affecting all age groups, with a prevalence as high as
59% in some low-income countries and a lifetime risk of
rape (attempted or completed) of 20% in women and 4%
in men [8, 9]. However, sexual abuse is also a concern in
high-income economies. In the United Kingdom, it is es-
timated that one in every 250 women aged 16–59 years
is raped every year, but only 18% of these rapes are
reported to the police [10]. Although most studies have
focused on the psychological consequences of rape,
many of the health implications are equally applicable to
victims of other forms of sexual abuse [7, 8, 10].
Other forms of childhood abuse have proven worthy
of
investigation.
Two
independent
meta-analyses
published in 2012 [7] and 2016 [3] showed that the
long-term adverse effects of early psychological/emo-
tional abuse (usually inflicted by adults) on depression
later in life are even stronger than the effects of
physical or sexual abuse. Moreover, early psycho-
logical/emotional maltreatment has also been related
to drug use, suicide attempts, risky sexual behaviour,
and adverse physical health outcomes (i.e., neuro-
logical, musculoskeletal and immune response disor-
ders) [4, 6, 7, 11].
Being bullied is the most common form of psycho-
logical/emotional maltreatment by peers experienced
early in life; it has an estimated prevalence of 36%
among school-age children [12–14]. Bullying is defined
as a harmful and aggressive behaviour by peers that is
carried out repeatedly and involves an imbalance of
power [12, 13]. Although perpetrators may consider it a
harmless rite of passage with few long-term consequences,
bullying has been associated with severe outcomes, in-
cluding school absenteeism, anxiety, depression, and sui-
cidality [14–16]. Although most research investigating the
long-term health consequences of bullying has focused on
school bullying, it occurs throughout the lifespan in all
societies and in many workplaces [13–16].
Several authors have suggested that multiple forms of
abuse are likely to co-occur and become recurrent,
showing a dose-response effect on different health
outcomes [3, 4, 6, 7]. A systematic review published in
2017 that included 37 high-quality studies showed that
individuals who suffered four or more adverse childhood
experiences (i.e., sexual, physical, emotional or other
forms of abuse) were between two and seven times more
likely to smoke, have problematic alcohol or drug use,
be involved in risky sexual behaviour or interpersonal
and self-directed violence than those with no history of
childhood adversity [6].
Childhood maltreatment also seems to affect other
outcomes in adulthood, such as health-related quality of
life (HRQoL) [4, 17]. HRQoL is a construct that repre-
sents an individual’s perception of the impact of ill
health on diverse life domains [18]. This outcome is
closely related to functional capacity, adherence to med-
ical treatments, disease severity and mortality [19, 20].
Therefore, the exploration of different outcomes related
to bullying and sexual abuse in the same population may
help clinicians to identify individuals with a greater
vulnerability to health impairment and to provide inter-
ventions that aim to mitigate their suffering.
In Australia, Moore et al. (2015) synthesised evidence
from 23 national studies and found that multiple forms
of child maltreatment are highly interrelated and are
associated
with
depression,
anxiety
and
intentional
self-harm [21]. Nonetheless, only a few studies in that
review included a representative sample of Australian
adults.
Systematic
reviews
have
highlighted
other
methodological limitations in the available literature.
These limitations include a lack of population-based
samples, studies involving a low percentage of males or
older adults, and few studies investigating the age of
onset, duration and/or severity of abuse [3, 4, 6, 21, 22].
Therefore, the main objective of this study was to
investigate the frequency, age of onset and duration of
bullying and sexual abuse in a representative sample of
adults living in South Australia (SA). We also wanted to
examine the association of these variables with harmful
behaviours (smoking dependence, excessive alcohol in-
take, and binge eating), antidepressant use, and HRQoL.
Both the independent associations of bullying or sexual
abuse with adverse health outcomes and the combined
effect of each form of maltreatment were explored. This
study also aimed to estimate the likelihood of having
ever experienced bullying and/or sexual abuse based on
the number of adverse health outcomes the individual
reported.
Methods
A cross-sectional
study
using
household
interviews
(Health Omnibus Survey) was performed. The main goal
of the Health Omnibus Survey is to collect, analyse and
interpret data that can then be used to plan, implement
and monitor health programmes and other initiatives
[23]. In 2015, the survey comprised 150 health questions
and was administered to a representative sample of
adults living in South Australia, a state with approxi-
mately 1.7 million inhabitants (73% living in metropol-
itan areas) [24].
Details regarding the methodology have been published
elsewhere [23, 25]. In summary, a multistage sampling

 process was conducted between September and December
2015, when clusters of 10 residences were systematically
selected from 530/3939 statistical areas (including urban
and rural areas) [24]. One dweller aged 15+ years was
randomly chosen (last person to have a birthday) in
each household. Individuals were excluded if they
were terminally ill/mentally incapacitated (n = 104) or
unable to speak English (n = 87). The final sample in-
cluded 3005 individuals (71.1% of the 4226 eligible
participants), but only adults (20+ years) were in-
cluded in the analyses (N = 2912).
The interviews took on average 35 min to complete
(range 30–40 min), and the survey included questions
on sociodemographic variables, HRQoL, self-reported
height and weight, lifestyle habits and risk perceptions
(i.e., physical activity, food consumption, alcohol intake,
smoking), participation in preventive activities, sleeping
habits, self-reported chronic health conditions (diagnosis
and management, including physical and mental health
diseases), falls, eating disorders, bullying, and sexual
abuse.
Bullying and sexual abuse
Due to the sensitive nature of these questions, the
non-health professional researchers were given support
regarding how to ask them and were advised to avoid
engaging in any form of dialogue about the details of the
experience. If the participant was an adolescent, these
sensitive questions were not asked. Cards were provided
with contact numbers for local helplines and contacts
for anyone who might become distressed by such ques-
tions. All the participants were provided with the follow-
ing opening statement: “Please note these next few
questions are about how experiences relate to physical
health. We do not need to know specific details. The
questions may be confrontational for some people, and
you can choose not to answer them if you are not com-
fortable.” No description of bullying or sexual abuse was
given
to
the
interviewees
prior
to
the
interview
questions.
The main exposure variables were then investigated
through the following self-labelling questions: “Have you
ever been bullied at school or work?” and “In your life-
time, have you ever experienced any type of sexual
abuse?”. After each question, the participants were asked
about the age when the last event occurred and how
long this form of abuse lasted. The age at the onset of
each form of abuse was then calculated (i.e., if the last
episode of sexual abuse occurred at 12 years, and it
lasted five years, the age of onset = seven years) and
classified as < 10 years (childhood), 10–19 years (adoles-
cence), or ≥ 20 years (adulthood) [26]. To investigate a
dose-response effect [5, 7, 13], the lifetime duration of
bullying or sexual abuse was also classified as < 1 month,
1–24 months, or > 24 months. Finally, to investigate the
cumulative effect of both bullying and sexual abuse (ever
occurred, independent of duration), they were combined
into one categorical variable with four categories: 1)
Neither bullying nor sexual abuse; 2) just bullying; 3)
just sexual abuse, or; 4) both bullying and sexual abuse.
The survey did not collect data regarding the specific
form of bullying or sexual abuse the victims experienced,
and
no
other
forms
of
early
maltreatment
were
investigated.
Harmful behaviours and antidepressant use
Considering that bullying and sexual abuse have been
related to behaviours that are compulsive, repetitive,
distressful,
and/or
excessive
and
have
deleterious
physical/mental consequences [4, 5, 7, 11, 13], three bin-
ary variables (yes/no) were investigated as indications of
harmful
behaviours:
smoking
dependence,
excessive
alcohol intake, and binge eating. Smoking dependence
was determined based on the Heaviness of Smoking
Index [27], which allocates points for the average
number of cigarettes smoked every day (0 = 10 or less;
1 = 11–20; 2 = 21–30; 3= > 30 cigarettes/day) and the
time from waking to smoking the first cigarette of the day
(0 = 60+ minutes; 1 = 31–60 min; 2 = 5–30 min; 3 = < 5
min). A score ≥ 3 points was used as the cut-off for smok-
ing dependence. Alcohol intake was investigated using
separate questions for the frequency of drinking and the
number of standard drinks (using a prompt card showing
the equivalence of a standard drink for different types of
alcohol) consumed in the last 12 months; excessive alco-
hol intake was defined as 5+ standard drinks of alcohol
consumed 5+ days/week [28]. Binge eating in the past
three months was self-reported through the following
question: “I would like to ask you about episodes of over-
eating. By overeating, or binge eating, I mean eating an un-
usually large amount of food in one go and at the time
feeling that your eating was out of control. Over the past 3
months, how often have you overeaten? Would you say… 1.
Not at all, 2. Less than weekly, 3. Once a week, or 4. Two
or more times a week.” The level of distress reported by
the participants was then investigated (“not at all”, “a lit-
tle”, or “a lot”). Binge eating was defined as overeating of
any duration associated with “a little” or “a lot” of distress.
Respondents were considered active users of antidepres-
sants if they were currently using any of the 22 different
antidepressant drugs available on the Pharmaceutical
Benefits Scheme (PBS) in Australia. A list of these medica-
tions and their alternative commercial names was used
during the interview (again using a prompt card).

 Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 12 (SF-12v1). The
12 questions in this instrument assess impairment in
physical and mental health in the past four weeks. The
questions were combined to generate scores; the scores
had a mean value of 50 and a standard deviation of 10,
with higher values indicating a better HRQoL [29, 30].
Confounding variables
The sociodemographic variables included as possible
confounders were sex (male or female), age (in years,
including a quadratic term for nonlinear associations),
marital status (married/living with a partner - yes or no),
area
of residence
(urban
or
rural),
quintiles

indicator
(2011
Australian Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas Index of
Relative Socioeconomic Advantage and Disadvantage,
SEIFA-IRSAD), highest education level attained (bache-
lor’s degree or higher; trade qualification; certificate/dip-
loma; secondary; less than secondary), working status
(employed full-time; employed part-time; unemployed
[including home duties and students]; retired), and
dwelling type (owned, rented or community/government
housing). The SEIFA-IRSAD is an index based on a range
of census variables and an indicator of the relative
economic and social advantage/disadvantage of people
and households within an area (higher scores indicate that
the respondent lives in a more advantaged area) [31].
Data analysis
Logistic regression was used to investigate the distribu-
tion of bullying and sexual abuse according to sociode-
mographic variables (adjusted for sex and age), and the
marginal
adjusted
prevalence
was
then
estimated.
Regression models were also used to investigate the
association of bullying and sexual abuse with harmful
behaviours, antidepressant use (logistic regression), and
HRQoL (linear regression), with full adjustment for all
sociodemographic variables. The results are expressed as
adjusted odds ratios (ORs, for binary outcomes) or re-
gression coefficients (βs, for PCS and MCS) with their
respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). When
assessing the cumulative effects of bullying and sexual
abuse on these outcomes, marginal adjusted prevalence
or means were estimated accordingly and reported with
their respective 95%CIs. Heterogeneity tests were con-
ducted to examine the association between age and
bullying and sexual abuse according to age, as well as
between bullying and sexual abuse and all outcomes
according to the participant’s sex and use of antidepres-
sants; the association was considered positive when the
interaction terms showed a p-value < 0.10 [32]. Finally,
multinomial
regression
was
used
to
estimate
the
adjusted predicted likelihood of past abuse (neither
bullying nor sexual abuse, just bullying, just sexual
abuse, or both bullying and sexual abuse) considering
the adverse health outcomes associated with these forms
of abuse as predictors (harmful behaviours, antidepres-
sant use, and HRQoL) and was adjusted for all sociode-
mographic variables. The results of this prediction are
presented graphically as % of each form of past abuse
according to the number of adverse health outcomes
within the same individual.
The statistical software STATA 14.0 (StataCorp, Texas,
USA) was used for analysis, and only individuals with
complete exposure variable and outcome data were in-
cluded. All results were weighted to the inverse of the
individual’s probability of selection within the household
(re-weighted to account for the estimated resident popu-
lation in SA in 2014 according to age and sex) and were
analysed considering the sampling design (clusters of
statistical areas) [23, 24]. Participants provided verbal
rather than written informed consent, due to the practi-
calities of carrying out a large-scale survey and the
low-risk nature of the survey content. All procedures
performed in this study were approved by the University
of Adelaide Human Research Ethics Committee (project
H-097-2010).
Results
Of the 2912 individuals aged 20+ years who were inter-
viewed in the study, 1.1% (n = 33) refused to answer the
questions on sexual abuse (n = 11 also refused to answer
the questions on bullying), while another six participants
had some missing data for other investigated outcomes.
The mean age of the final sample (unweighted N = 2873)
was 48.8 ± 18.1 years (49.3% males). The prevalence of
ever being bullied was 45.6% (95% CI 43.3–47.9), the
prevalence of ever being sexually abused was 10.4% (95%
CI 9.1–11.9), and 7.3% (95% CI 6.2–8.5) reported both
forms of abuse. Approximately 45% of all cases of bully-
ing and a similar proportion of sexual abuse cases
started in adolescence (10–19 years), while 20.2 and
32.6% started in childhood (< 10 years). Moreover, 15.8%
of those who were bullied and 15.0% of those who were
sexually abused suffered from these forms of abuse for
more than 24 months, with a prevalence up to 3.7 times
higher when the abuse started in childhood rather than
later in life (Additional file 1).
Sexual abuse was 4.7 times more frequent in females
than in males, while the rates of bullying were similar
for both sexes (Table 1). Conversely, the prevalence of
bullying decreased with age, while that of sexual abuse
remained relatively stable in most age groups. How-
ever, there was evidence of an interaction between
sex and age in their association with both forms of
abuse (Additional file 2): the rate of bullying was
similar in males and females younger than 50 years,
but bullying was less frequent among elderly women;
González-Chica et al. BMC Public Health           (2019) 19:26 
Page 4 of 12
 the rate of sexual abuse remained steady at approxi-
mately 4% among men of all age groups, while among
women, the highest frequency was among those aged
35–64 years.
Table 1 also shows that both forms of abuse were less
prevalent among those who were married/living with a
partner,

observed

residence area or socioeconomic position. Bullying rates

 were also higher in all groups with an educational level
equal to or higher than secondary school, while sexual
abuse was more common among those with a certifi-
cate/diploma. Both conditions occurred less frequently
among retired individuals, while those who were not
working showed the highest prevalence of sexual abuse.
Although dwelling type was not associated with bullying,
those living in community/government housing were 1.8
times more likely than homeowners to report a history
of sexual abuse.
Table 2 presents the association between age of onset
and duration of bullying or sexual abuse with smoking
dependence (7.8%), excessive alcohol intake (14.3%),
binge eating (8.1%) and current use of antidepressants
(17.2%). Smoking dependence was not associated with
the age when bullying started but was more frequent
when it lasted more than 24 months, while those who
suffered sexual abuse in childhood or adulthood or
lasted ≥1 month were twice as likely to be smoking
dependent compared to those who were never abused.
On the other hand, only being bullied (starting in
childhood or lasting > 24 months) was related to exces-
sive alcohol intake. Additionally, bullying at any age or
that lasted 1–24 months was associated with a higher
frequency of binge eating and was more frequent when
sexual abuse started in childhood or adulthood or lasted
less than one month. On the other hand, the use of anti-
depressants was up to four times more frequent among
those who were bullied or sexually abused, independent
of the age of onset or duration.
Table 3 shows the association between bullying or
sexual abuse with PCS (mean = 48.4 ± 10.4 points) and
MCS (mean = 52.5 ± 8.7 points). In general, bullying and
sexual abuse were associated with a lower PCS and

 MCS, independent of the age at onset or its duration.
The strongest relationships with PCS were for bullying
starting in adolescence, sexual abuse starting in adult-
hood, or when both forms of abuse lasted 24 months or
more. The magnitude of the associations were stronger
for MCS than for PCS, and bullying that started in
adulthood or lasted > 24 months was more likely to be
associated with this outcome. The MCS was at least four
points lower among those who reported sexual abuse,
independent of the age when it started, and was six
points lower when this form of abuse occurred for 1 to
24 months.
The magnitude and direction of the associations
remained relatively stable when the results reported
above
were
adjusted
for
mental
health
status
(Additional files 3 and 4).
When we investigated the association of bullying and
sexual abuse combined (just bullying = 38.2%; just sexual
abuse = 3.1%; both conditions = 7.3%) with these out-
comes (Fig. 1), there was a cumulative adverse relation-
ship with smoking dependence (Fig. 1a), binge eating
(Fig. 1c), PCS (Fig. 1e) and MCS (Fig. 1f), with those
who experienced both conditions showing the worst out-
comes. The use of antidepressants was four times more
frequent among individuals who reported sexual abuse
(with or without bullying), while intermediate values
were observed among those who experienced bullying
but no sexual abuse (Fig. 1d). No association was ob-
served with excessive alcohol intake (Fig. 1b).
Based on these results, we predicted the probability of
an individual having experienced bullying and/or sexual
abuse based on his or her number of negative health
outcomes (smoking dependence, binge eating, current
use of antidepressants, lower PCS, and lower MCS)
(Fig. 2). The likelihood of having suffered some form of
abuse increased from 49.7% among those who had none
of these outcomes to 82.8% among those with four or
more negative health-related outcomes. The greatest in-
crease was for the probability of having experienced
both bullying and sexual abuse, which was eight times
more likely among those who reported four or more
outcomes.
None of the previously tested associations differed by
sex or the use of medications for mental health prob-
lems (p-value for heterogeneity > 0.10 in all cases).
Discussion
Five key findings of this population-based cross-sectional
study can be highlighted. First, almost half of the adults
of both sexes self-reported that they had been bullied,
while nearly two out of ten women self-reported having
ever been sexually abused, compared to one in thirty
men. Second, one-third of the cases of bullying and
22.5% of the cases of sexual abuse started in adulthood.
Independent of the age at onset, both forms of abuse
were, in general, more likely to be associated with im-
paired mental health than with poor physical health.
Third, 15% of individuals suffered these forms of abuse
for more than 24 months, and except for alcohol intake
and binge eating, long-lasting abuse showed a consistent
adverse relationship with all other outcomes, including
PCS. Fourth, bullying and sexual abuse showed a cumu-
lative adverse association with smoking dependence,
binge eating, and HRQoL (PCS or MCS), whereas sexual
abuse was more likely than bullying to be related to anti-
depressant use. Finally, the likelihood of having ever
been bullied or sexually abused was 83% among those
with four or more outcomes (i.e., smoking dependence,

 binge eating, current use of antidepressants, lower PCS,
and lower MCS), while the probability of having suffered
both forms of abuse was 24%.
The prevalence of bullying in our sample was higher
than the estimated 36% overall prevalence of school
bullying [12–14] and the 17% prevalence of workplace
bullying (considering random samples and the investiga-
tion of bullying using self-labelled questions without a
definition) [33] reported in systematic reviews. However,
a community-based Australian cohort study that used a
single-item survey found a similar prevalence of bullying
(46% of adults were “ever” bullied, and 7% were bullied
at work in the previous six months) [34]. Estimates of
bullying prevalence are influenced by the measurement
method used (i.e., self-labelling vs a behavioural/oper-
ational approach), sampling procedures, and geograph-
ical differences [12–14, 33]. It has been suggested that
self-labelling may underestimate the real prevalence of
bullying compared to other approaches [35]. Nonethe-
less, an Australian study that included almost 1500
adults (48% males) found a very high concordance
between self-labelling and a multi-dimensional scale of
bullying behaviours (area under the curve 0.88) [34].
Therefore, the use of questions based on self-labelled
bullying seems appropriate when investigating this form
of abuse in large population-based surveys, especially
when other health outcomes are investigated at the same
time. However, although most cases of bullying are
related to the school environment [12, 14], additional
questions may be necessary to investigate other forms of
bullying, such as cyberbullying or bullying in the work-
place. In our study, one-third of all cases of bullying
started in adulthood (15% among those aged 20–34
years, 44% at the ages of 35–64 years, 40% in the elderly;
data not shown in tables), suggesting they are related to
bullying outside of the school environment.
Similar methodological limitations apply to the investi-
gation of sexual abuse, as the estimated frequencies vary
according to the data source, the definition and severity of
sexual abuse, and the investigated samples [8, 9, 36, 37].
However, our findings are consistent with the available lit-
erature. For example, in Australia, it has been estimated
that the prevalence of childhood sexual abuse ranges from
11.6 to 21.5% in women and 4.1 to 7.5% in men (figures
similar to those observed in other high-income countries)
[21, 36]. Moreover, our results indicate that almost a quar-
ter of the reported sexual abuse started in adulthood. This
is consistent with a report by the World Health Organisa-
tion [8], which identified that up to 23% of adult women
in
high-income
countries
have
ever
been
sexually
assaulted by an intimate partner (6% in the previous 12
months). Therefore, although face-to-face interviews may
affect the exploration of sensitive issues, such as sexual
abuse, the consistency of our results with previous studies

 suggest the methodology used was able to provide valid
estimates for this form of abuse. In fact, only 33 partici-
pants (1.1% of the sample) refused to answer the questions
on sexual abuse, suggesting that this methodology could
be used in other routine and social surveys in Australia.
When we examined the relationships between re-
ported abuse and outcomes, the identified associations
between single and combined estimates of bullying and
physical and mental health problems are in the expected
direction compared to the results of more detailed and
lengthy instruments used in other studies. In 2017, a
meta-analysis of 37 high-quality studies showed that
those who suffered multiple forms of abuse in childhood
were at moderate risk (ORs of two to three) for smoking,
heavy alcohol use, and poor self-rated health compared
to those with no history of childhood abuse. Consistent
with our findings for antidepressant use and MCS, that
study also found stronger associations with poor mental
health (ORs of more than three) than with physical
health
variables
[6].
Moreover,
sexual
abuse
is
a
well-recognised risk factor for the development of eating
disorders [38, 39], and physical or emotional abuse in
childhood is associated with a three-fold higher risk of eat-
ing disorders [7]. Although the specific effects of bullying
on this health outcome have been much less studied, a
longitudinal study of children and adolescents in the
United States showed that bullying victims were at in-
creased risk of anorexia and bulimia nervosa in early
adulthood. These results persisted even after the previous
psychiatric status (including a history of eating disorder
symptoms) and family adversities were considered [40].
More prolonged periods of abuse have been found to be
related to more harmful effects [5, 7, 13], which was also
observed in our study for most outcomes. The few excep-
tions included binge eating and MCS (associated with sex-
ual abuse), for which abuse experiences of shorter
duration were also detrimental. This effect may occur be-
cause, depending on the severity of the abuse, psycho-
logical reactions are triggered as soon as the aggression
starts, leading to intense and unpredictable emotional re-
sponses that may vary considerably [10]. Furthermore,
abuse episodes tend to be recurrent and coexist with other
forms of maltreatment [3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 21]. In our study,
71% of the individuals who reported sexual abuse also suf-
fered bullying at some time in their life. These two forms
of abuse showed an additive adverse relationship with
smoking dependence, binge eating, reduced PCS and
MCS, but sexual abuse had a stronger association with
antidepressant use than bullying.
Our results also showed that people living without a
partner, those with an educational level equivalent to
certificate/diploma, and those who were not currently
working had a higher prevalence of both bullying and
sexual abuse. We believe that health professionals should
be aware that in addition to these sociodemographic risk
factors, the likelihood of having ever been bullied or
sexually abused is 83% among individuals who report
the combination of smoking dependence, binge eating,
antidepressant use, and lower HRQoL. One in four pa-
tients may have suffered both bullying and sexual abuse.
Therefore, asking adult patients about their history of
addictive behaviours, antidepressant use or reduced
quality of life could help health professionals identify
victims of abuse. Delays in the identification of such
abuse may increase the risk of more severe adverse out-
comes, including suicidality, major depressive disorders,
or even intergenerational effects [5, 6, 13, 15, 21].
The strengths of our study include the investigation of
a population-based sample (well distributed in terms of
sex, age, and socioeconomic groups), the use of a
well-recognised instrument to assess HRQoL, and the
collection of additional relevant data (age at onset and
duration) for bullying and sexual abuse.
However, some limitations should be recognised. First
and most important, the cross-sectional design does not
allow evaluation of the temporality of any associations
(i.e., whether the health outcomes coincided with or
preceded the experience of victimisation, or whether the
individual sought or received treatment). Second, retro-
spective and uncorroborated accounts of early childhood
abuse are subject to biases and omissions, especially
among adults who suffer from depressive or alcohol-use
disorder [41]. Moreover, correlated misclassifications
and residual confounding cannot be excluded as all mea-
sures were self-reported, bullying and sexual abuse were
investigated through self-labelling questions, and the re-
sults were not adjusted for socioeconomic conditions at
the time the abuse was experienced. However, it is not
likely that these sources of bias affected our results as
only 1% of the participants refused to answer questions
regarding these forms of abuse. The findings are also
consistent with the results from research studies that
utilised longitudinal designs and much more detailed
and lengthy instruments [3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 21]. Finally, other
addictive behaviours that are more strongly related to
childhood abuse were not investigated [6]; such behav-
iours include illicit substance abuse/misuse, risky sexual
behaviours, gambling, interpersonal and self-directed
violence,
or
other
forms
of
eating
disorders
(e.g.,
purging). Depression per se was also not investigated,
although current use of antidepressants indicates that
individuals were assessed and managed by a physician
after the symptoms of depression were verified.
Conclusions
This study shows that the use of self-labelling questions
to investigate sensitive aspects, such as bullying and
sexual abuse, in a survey is feasible. Such questions can

Page 10 of 12
 provide estimates of prevalence and associations that are
consistent
with
findings
from
studies
using
more
detailed instruments (i.e., behavioural/operational ap-
proaches). Consistent with the available literature, sexual
abuse and bullying were related to harmful behaviours
(smoking dependence and binge eating), antidepressant
use, and reduced HRQoL (especially MCS). These asso-
ciations were identified even when the bullying or sexual
abuse started in adulthood, and although there may be a
dose-response effect, even the experience of a short dur-
ation of abuse appears to be related to these outcomes.
Bullying is also common among sexually abused individ-
uals, and both forms of abuse have an additive effect on
health outcomes. Strategies that aim to prevent these
forms of abuse are important. Identifying survivors of
both forms of abuse is important to provide support and
reduce more severe mental and physical consequences
in the future.
