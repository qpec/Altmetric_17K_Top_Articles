Somatic mutations during stem cell division are responsible for several cancers. In principle, a
similar process could occur during the intense cell proliferation accompanying human brain
development, leading to the accumulation of regionally distributed foci of mutations. Using
dual platform >5000-fold depth sequencing of 102 genes in 173 adult human brain samples,
we detect and validate somatic mutations in 27 of 54 brains. Using a mathematical model of
neurodevelopment and approximate Bayesian inference, we predict that macroscopic islands
of pathologically mutated neurons are likely to be common in the general population. The
detected mutation spectrum also includes DNMT3A and TET2 which are likely to have ori-
ginated from blood cell lineages. Together, these findings establish developmental muta-
genesis as a potential mechanism for neurodegenerative disorders, and provide a novel
mechanism for the regional onset and focal pathology in sporadic cases.

ommon neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkin-
son’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), are
characterised by toxic protein aggregation and cell loss in
defined brain regions1,2. The majority of patients have no family
history, but in ~5% of cases, germ line genetic variants in one of
~50 genes either cause or contribute to disease risk, with a
clinically indistinguishable phenotype3,4. For most neurodegen-
erative disease genes, a single mutated allele is required to cause
disease through haploinsufficiency or a dominant negative effect.
This raises the possibility that somatic mutations arising in the
same genes within a specific cell lineage contribute to the
pathogenesis of non-familial cases. Although we have no direct
evidence, islands of cells containing these mutations could syn-
thesise misfolded proteins with the potential to spread through-
out the brain during human life5. Technological limitations have
prevented this question from being addressed, but if correct, then
developmental mutagenesis could be a major cause of sporadic
neurodegenerative diseases.
The hypothesis can be tested by sequencing a very large
number of single neurons, or by ultra high-depth re-sequencing
DNA extracted from a pool of cells isolated from brain tissue
samples. Since the overall low frequency of somatic mutation
events approximates the intrinsic DNA sequencing error rate,
some form of experimental validation is critical. This is not
possible with single-cell approaches because individual neurons
and glia are destroyed during the sequencing process. Although
recent single-cell studies provide evidence that somatic mutations
do occur in the developing brain6,7, understanding the total
mutational burden across the human brain will require a massive
sequencing effort. Here we took a complementary approach,
harnessing ultra-high depth sequencing to survey the somatic
mutations across different brain regions. Using a computational
model of brain development, we extrapolate our findings across
the human brain, and provide an estimate of the somatic muta-
tion burden in the human population.
Results and Discussion
Performance metrics and variant validation. We sequenced all
exons of 56 genes known to cause, or predispose to, common
neurodegenerative disorders (132,617 base pairs (bp)) (Supple-
mentary Table 1, left), and 46 control genes expressed at low
levels in the brain which are typically associated with cancer
(152,519 bp) (Supplementary Table 1, right, subsequently referred
to as ‘cancer’ genes). The sequencing pipeline was developed to
ensure that 99.6% of coding bases were covered at >1000-fold
depth across both gene panels, some of which are notoriously
difficult to sequence comprehensively (e.g., MAPT in Fig. 1a and
Supplementary Fig. 1). Spiked HapMap control samples called by
differing combinations of variant callers enabled us to establish a
variant calling algorithm with a high sensitivity and specificity
(Fig. 1b–d and Supplementary Fig. 2, see Methods). Somatic
mutations that were present in only one brain region (subse-
quently termed single region mutations, SRMs) and those that
were present in more than one sample (multi-region mutations,
MRMs) above 0.5% variant allele frequency (VAF) (Fig. 1b, c)
were optimally called by utilising the high sensitivity afforded by
MuTect28 or Varscan29,10, followed by deepSNV11,12 to ensure
high specificity confirmation calling which takes into account
base error rates within the platform (Fig. 1e and Supplementary
Fig. 2, see Methods). This resulted in a calling pipeline with 93%
sensitivity and 99% specificity to detect variants above a VAF of
0.5% (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 2). A greater proportion
of the HapMap variants at low VAF were detected when the
sequence depth increased from 1000-fold to 7000-fold. VAF > 1%
were consistently detected when the sequencing depth was
>1000-fold, but VAF >0.5% required >4000-fold depth to mini-
mise the false-negative rate of any caller across the 102 gene
285 kb panel (Fig. 1d).
Ultra-high-depth re-sequencing was performed on 173 frozen
brain regions from post-mortem cases of AD (n = 20 brains),
Lewy body (LB) disease (PD or Dementia with LB: n = 20 brains),
and age matched controls with no significant neuropathology
(n = 14 brains) (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Paired blood
DNA was available for sequencing in six subjects (control: n = 2,
AD: n = 1, LB: n = 3). Quantitative immunohistochemistry of
hyperphosphorylated tau (HP-T), β-amyloid, and α-synuclein
was performed on all selected brain regions (cerebellum: CB = 54,
Entorhinal cortex: EC = 53, Frontal cortex: FC = 32, Medulla:
Med = 24, Cingulate: Cin = 10) (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4).
An overall mean sequencing depth for the 102 genes using the
accuracy and content enhanced (ACE) platform of 5374-fold
(s.d. = 745) (Fig. 1f) was achieved, set in order to minimise the
false-negative rate determined from HapMap-spiked control
samples (Fig. 1d). Independent validation of the detected variants
was performed on the same tissue samples using an orthogonal
technique, which incorporated barcode-labelled amplicons (Halo-
plexHS, sequenced to a mean depth of 6830-fold, s.d. = 1549)
(Fig. 1f). After quality control (QC), the ACE platform detected
62 somatic variants (56 single-nucleotide variants, SNVs; and 6
insertion-deletion variants, indels) in 44 brain samples (50% of
the entire cohort of brains—controls: n = 6/14, AD: n = 9/20, LB:
n = 12/20) and 4 blood samples. Totally, 56 of these variants were
also covered by the HaloplexHS platform, showing a strong
concordance in the VAF measured by the discovery and
validation platforms (r2 = 0.953, P < 2.2 × 10−16) (Fig. 2a, b).
Single regional mutations. Eighteen somatic mutations (56.4%
of the total 39 detected variants) were present in only 1 brain
region within an individual, and 4 somatic variants in only 1
blood sample (Fig. 2c, d, Fig. 3a–e, h, Supplementary Figs. 3–5
and Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Data 1). These
SRMs were detected at a mean VAF of 0.84% (s.d. = 0.005).
Confidence intervals for the VAF were based on the normal
approximation to account for any potential sampling bias arising
during sequencing (Fig. 3a–d). The SRMs were equally likely to
arise in any brain region (CB = 6/54 brains, 11.1%; EC = 7/53
brains, 13.2%; FC = 2/32 brains, 6.3%; Med = 3/24 brains, 12.5%)
and were equally likely to occur in neurodegenerative disease (7/
132,617 bp) or cancer genes (11/152,519 bp) (P = 0.64, Chi-
squared with Yates correction) (Supplementary Figs. 3–5).
The majority of SRMs in brain were C > T substitutions (n = 14/
18, 77.8%) (Fig. 3f, h) consistent with spontaneous deamination of
5-methyl-cytosine13, as observed in single neurons14. Purine–purine
transitions on the non-template strand were exclusively seen in case
genes (n = 4/7) (P = 0.01 vs. Control genes, Fisher’s exact test) in
keeping with replication-transcription collisions15, as seen in single
cortical neurons14. However, given that the same rare mutations
were detected in ≥0.5% of the mapped reads, and were therefore
present in many cells, it is highly likely that they arose during
development. The flanking 5′ and 3′ sequence of the SRMs were
distinct from mutational ‘signatures’ described in cancers16,
suggestive of a different mechanism of mutagenesis (Fig. 3f and
Supplementary Table 6). Seven mutations occurred in neurode-
generative disease genes with a mean VAF of 0.82% (s.d. = 0.003,
range: 0.47–1.56%). There was no difference in the proportion of
SRMs in neurodegenerative disease genes between any disease
group (AD 5/20; LB = 1/20; control 1/14) (Fig. 3a–d). Based upon
the observed frequency of SRMs in neurodegenerative disease genes
in this study (13% of brains), we estimate that 190 cases and 190
controls would be required to detect a twofold increase in the

(Supplementary Fig. 6).
Using a simplified mathematical model of neurodevelopment
to assist with the interpretation of our experimental data, we
modelled brain development as a deterministic branching
process, based on the assumption that de novo mutations are
randomly distributed to daughter cells17, and that symmetric cell
divisions are common throughout neurodevelopment. We also
studied the potential impact of a simple model of cell death
during brain development (ranging from 50%18,19 to >99%),
finding that this had negligible impact on the qualitative
behaviour of the model (Supplementary Note 1).

 The HaloplexHS barcode tagging approach allowed us to
determine both the number of cells sequenced (~611,285), and
the proportion of cells containing a somatic mutation (Fig. 4a, b).
We determined the somatic focal mutation rate in the human
brain to be 4.8 × 10−10–2.99 × 10−9 per base per cell division
(95% Bayesian credible interval (BCI)) (Fig. 5a, b; Supplementary
Methods). This closely approximates the somatic mutation rates
in mitotically active tissues20, providing further reassurance that
our model was a reasonable model of cell division in the
developing human brain. We then simulated the neurodevelop-
ment of individuals under the model, given the inferred mutation
rate, to find the frequency and size of brain regions harbouring
known pathological mutations in neurodegenerative disease genes
(Human Gene Mutation Database21) (Fig. 5c–h). We found that
each individual tended to have 105–106 pathologically mutated
cells (Fig. 5e). Similar results were obtained using an alternative
modelling approach, where the brain was assumed to consist of
regions of a fixed size, each with an independent probability of
being homogeneously mutated (see Supplementary Note 6,
Supplementary Fig. 11E). We found that 10.8% (±0.1% s.d.) of
simulated individuals possessed one or more regions of 2.62 × 105
spatially
contiguous
pathologically
mutated
cells
(Fig.
5f).
Furthermore, each individual brain was found to harbour
75–481 regions (95% BCI) of 128 pathologically mutated cells
(Fig. 5g).
Our modelling approach is a crude approximation of real
neurodevelopment, neglecting subtleties relating to the precise
mechanisms of cell death; the existence of a progenitor founder
pool; asymmetric cell division in the later stages and cellular
migration, for example. In Supplementary Notes 1–6, we explore
several alternative models which attempt to address these
complexities (Supplementary Figs. 8–11). Overall, we find that
many of our conclusions are broadly robust to these alternative
model structures. The central conclusion from these models is
that if neurodevelopment is topologically similar, but not
necessarily equivalent, to a deterministic branching process, then
we expect islands of pathologically mutated cells to exist.
Furthermore, if we assume that during neurodevelopment the
mutation rate of DNA is on the order of 10−10–10−9 mutations
per base per cell division20,22 (Fig. 5b), given unbiased, spatially
proximal, replication of daughter cells once the brain consists of
approximately 106 cells, then a simple order-of-magnitude
estimate (Supplementary Note 4) suggests that every individual
is expected to possess 1 pathologically mutated focal mutation
consisting of approximately 104–105 cells once the brain has fully
developed. This argument is independent of the neurodevelop-
mental mechanism prior to the brain consisting of 106 cells. Our
model serves as an initial means to explore the prevalence of these
mutated foci, suggesting that such foci are possessed by almost all
individuals. These regions may have the potential to generate
mutant proteins that form novel fibrillar structures, which could
spread and cause different neurodegenerative diseases23, or
modify the clinical phenotype, depending on the original mutated
gene.
Multiple regional mutations. Seventeen mutations (43.6% of the
total 39 detected variants) were present in more than one brain
region, or in a paired blood sample and brain (Fig. 2c, d,
Fig. 3a–e, h, Supplementary Table 5, Supplementary Figs. 3–5 and
Supplementary Data 1). These mutations had a significantly
higher
VAF
than
SRMs
(3.67%,
s.d. = 0.04,
P = 0.0024)
(Fig. 3a–e). Only one of these variants occurred in a neurode-
generative disease gene (Case number 12: p.R464R in TAF15,
mean VAF 6.23%, s.d. = 0.016), which was present in all 3 brain
regions sampled from this single control individual (VAFs in
cerebellum: 4.37%, entorhinal cortex: 6.98% and frontal cor-
tex:7.35%). Based on these observations, we estimate that muta-
tions within neurodegenerative disease genes will be present
diffusely across the brain in up to 9.77% of all humans (95% CI:
0.33%–9.77%, Wilson score interval test). Sixteen MRMs (94%)
occurred in cancer genes, with 15 (93.8%) known to be associated
with myeloproliferative blood disorders (n = 19 of the 46 genes in
the cancer panel). This was greater than expected when compared
to solid organ tumour or non-cancerous control genes (Supple-
mentary Table 1) (n = 27 of 46 genes, P = 7.45 × 10−6), raising
the suspicion that specific MRMs were derived from the circu-
lating blood cells. The two genes most frequently mutated in our
study (DNMT3A, n = 6; TET2, n = 6) account for the majority of
age-related clonal haematopoietic mutations24,25; and four of the
MRMs (23.6% of MRMs, DNMT3A p.R882H, DNMT3A p.P700L,
DNMT3A c.1667_splice, TET2 c.3472_splice) involved known
mutational hotspots25 (Supplementary Data 1). Given that these
specific alleles were also detected in our study, this strongly
supports a clonal hematopoetic origin for these particular
mutations rather than an early developmental origin within the
nervous system. In keeping with this, the VAF of the myelo-
proliferative gene mutations was always greater in available paired
blood samples than in the brain (n = 4) (Figs. 2c, Fig. 3e and
Supplementary Figs. 3–5). However, the fold difference was sur-
prisingly
low
(mean
blood:brain
VAF
ratio = 7.92,
range:
2.10–11.98), suggesting that at least some of the rare clonal
mutations were present in cells outside the vasculature, most
probably including migratory immune cells26.

NA12878 was spiked into DNA from cell-line NA12877 using 2, 5, 10, 20, or 50 ng of NA12878, making up to 1 µg total DNA with NA12877 to create
relative VAF of 0.2%–5%. deepSNV, MuTect2, Varscan2 somatic caller and Varscan un-paired calling were employed in different combinations to
determine the sensitivity and specificity to detect variants at each VAF. The optimum caller pipeline was set at a VAF of 0.5% using a dual calling approach
for variants called by either MuTect2 or Varscan2, which had a 92.98% sensitivity and 99.9984% specificity. c Number of observed variants called by

sequencing depth was >1000-fold, but VAF > 0.5% required >4000-fold depth to minimise the false-negative rate of any caller across the 102 gene 285 kb
panel. e Schematic overview of the calling algorithm used in the study. Variants called from paired sample calling by either MuTect2 or Varscan2 were
selected. All brain regions from those individuals were then compared to both each other (for intra-regional variation), and then to all other individuals (for
inter individual variation) for those alleles to ensure that detected variants from Varscan2 or MuTect2 were truly focal or Multi-focal in nature. f The

 Brains with more than one mutation. Nine brains possessed
more than one mutation across all samples sequenced (Supple-
mentary Table 5, Supplementary Figs. 3–5 and Supplementary
Data 1). Four of these brains had two mutations in genes asso-
ciated with haematological malignancies which were either
detected in blood or showed the same profile in different brain
regions, thereby consistent with translocation into the brain.
However, three individuals had a mutation profile that may cast
light on the development of somatic mutations within the brain.
Brain 17 (AD) had two focal mutations within the cerebellum
(UCHL1 p.I93I (1.56% VAF), and PDGFRB p.I985fs (0.64%
VAF)). Whilst the detection of more than one mutation within a

somatic mutations, with competition between subclones and
sequential
subclone
evolution27–29,
being
synonymous,
the
UCHL1 variant itself is unlikely to have promoted the evolution
of the PDGFRB mutation (Supplementary Fig. 3). Brain 34 (AD)
contained two focal splice-site mutations in SETX and ERBB2
within the entorhinal cortex. ERBB2 encodes the erbB2 proto-
oncogene and splice variants can act as major oncogenic dri-
vers30, which potentially increased the likelihood of developing
other somatic mutation such as that observed in SETX (Supple-
mentary Fig. 3). However, against this, the two variants had
similar VAFs (SETX: 0.60% and ERBB2: 0.71%), suggesting that
they are independent rare events in the pool of sequenced cells.
Finally, in brain 54 (LB) we observed two mutations in TP53
(Supplementary Table 5, Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplemen-
tary Data 1): p.V143M was found in the medulla (VAF 1.75%),
and entorhinal cortex (VAF 0.86%); and p.R174W was present
only in the entorhinal cortex (VAF 0.46%). This is consistent with
the hypothesis that p.V143M arose earlier in brain development
before the p.R174W mutation arose within a subclone of cells
only populating the entorhinal cortex. Given the strong pro-
oncogenic effects of TP53 gene mutations31, these data also
provide a possible explanation for unexplained brain malig-
nancies32. Long-read length deep sequencing will be required to
resolve these possibilities.
Potential associations with disease. Finally, and intriguingly,
non-synonymous or frame-shift mutations in hematopoietic
disorder genes were detected in 40% of LB brains (8/20), in
contrast with controls (7%, 1/14; P = 0.05, where the frequency
was consistent with previous reports24,25,33). Given the role of
DNMT3A and TET2 in regulating DNA methylation34,35, these
findings provide one explanation for the concordant changes in
DNA methylation seen in the blood and brains of PD patients
who share LB pathology36. The spatial distribution of DNMT3A
and TET2 variants mirrored the quantitative neuropathology,
with the VAF in medulla 2.1-fold greater than entorhinal cortex
(s.d. = 0.69, P = 0.0064). This could reflect regional weakness of
the blood-brain barrier seen in PD37 and other neurodegenerative
disorders38. Given that clonal haematopoetic variants in TET2
accelerate age-related atherosclerosis in mice39, our findings raise
the possibility that blood cell precursors harbouring somatic
mutations translocate into the brain and contribute to the
pathogenesis and clinical presentation of neurodegenerative dis-
eases through cells derived from myeloid precursors40.
In conclusion, based on observations from 173 human brain
tissue samples, and ~611,000 cells, our findings indicate that the
human brain is highly likely to contain many zones of cells
harbouring somatic mutations, including mutations affecting
neurodegenerative disease genes. Our extrapolations are based on
the assumption that there are similar rates of mutation across the
genome, which we accept may not be the case. However, if these
mutations involve neurodegenerative disease genes, they could
contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.
Although pathogenic mutations occurring within the first ~1000
cells during brain development are rare, these are likely to cause a
disease phenotype because they will affect a large proportion of
brain neurons. Our study was not sufficiently large to show this
directly, but this provides a potential explanation for common
sporadic neurodegenerative diseases which currently affect ~10%
of people in the developed world41,42. It is conceivable that
detecting these mutations during life will increase diagnostic
precision, leading to new therapies, particularly if they involve
targets amenable to pharmacological intervention within vulner-
able neural circuits43.
Methods
Post-mortem brains and histopathology. Frozen brains were identified from the
Newcastle Brain Tissue Resource (NBTR) fulfilling both pre and post-mortem
criteria for either AD (n = 20); PD dementia or Dementia with Lewy bodies (n =
20); and healthy controls >65 years old with no clinical ante mortem history of
cognitive impairment or movement disorder, no family history (>1 first degree
relative) with any neurodegenerative disease, and neuropathological features con-
sistent with normal aging (n = 15) (Supplementary Table 3). Samples were pro-
vided following ethical approval from Newcastle University Brain Tissue Resource
(NBTR2013083PC). Totally, 54 cases remained after QC of the sequencing data
(Supplementary Table 3) and 1 cm3 blocks of grey matter were carefully manually
dissected from each region (frontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, cingulate gyrus and
medulla) after excluding macroscopically identifiable white matter or vascular
tissue (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4).
Quantitative neuropathological data was obtained on fixed sections from the
same regions using AT8 (for phospho-tau), 4G8 (for β-amyloid) and α-synuclein
antibody staining on slides from all brain regions except the cerebellum. The
relative quantity of the proportion of area covered by immunopositive staining was
performed as previously described44, and after correction for white-matter area
where appropriate (Supplementary Table 4).
Sequencing and validation platforms. Two panels were defined incorporating
102 genes (Supplementary Table 1). Panel 1 (132,617 bp): 56 genes known to cause
monogenic forms of neurodegenerative disease or disease risk modifiers (odds
ratio > 2) identified through a systematic review45. Panel 2 (152,519 base-pairs): 46
genes associated with cancer selected from an existing clinical cancer panel (Per-
sonalis Inc., USA) showing the lowest transcript levels in the brain. Primary
genotyping was performed using the ACE technology (Personalis Inc., USA)
containing a backbone of the SureSelect probe set (Agilent, USA) with additional
custom capture probes to significantly improve overall coverage ACE platform, in
which the augmented probe design enabled coverage of 99.6% of coding regions at
>1000-fold depth (Supplementary Fig. 1). An example of this augmented coverage
in MAPT is shown in Fig. 1 and TET2 and DNMT3A in Supplementary Figure 1b.
Validation was performed using HaloplexHS capture technology designed using the
Agilent SureDesign tool to capture all exons and 25 bp of intronic flanking regions
of all 102 genes (Supplementary Fig. 1).
For the ACE platform, 1 µg of genomic DNA was extracted from brain, blood or
HapMap controls, and was Covaris sheared, end repaired and ligated with
adaptors. Adaptor ligated DNA fragments were amplified by PCR with 6 cycles,
and subjected to SureSelect enrichment with probe panels for all 102 genes. An
additional 10 cycles of PCR were performed with enriched material. For the
HaloplexHS platform, in parallel, but independently, equal quantities of DNA to
those utilised for the ACE platform were enriched by the same method. Sequencing
of enriched DNA from both capture protocols was performed using HiSeq 2500
(Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) sequencers with single lane, paired-end 2 × 101 bp
reads and Illumina’s proprietary Reversible Terminator Chemistry (v3).
Sample dilutions for the level of detection testing. The limits of detection of
minor alleles was determined for both platforms using HapMap CEPH cell-line
DNA (Coriell Institute) to simulate allele frequencies (AF) ranging 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and
Fig. 2 Somatic mutations detected in 179 samples from 54 human brains. a Examples of somatic mutations initially detected using SureSelect ACE platform
and then validated on the HaloplexHS platform. Each plot shows VAF across all the brain samples for the specific alleles indicated. Somatic mutations with
VAFs > 10% are shown in the left plot, somatic mutations with 2% < VAFs < 10% are shown in the left and middle plots, and somatic mutations with 0.5%
< VAFs < 2% are shown in the middle and right plots. SRMs identified by the SureSelect ACE platform are shown in green, and MRMs are shown in red.
Blue symbols are the VAF which fall below the threshold for detection on the Haloplex platform. Thus, the data show that variants detected by SureSelect
ACE are also detected by the HaloplexHS platform, which has a negligible false positive rate for VAF > 0.5%. b Correlation of VAF for the 56 detected
alleles in the ACE platform and the HaloplexHS platform. c VAF in each tissue type / brain region for each of the 39 detected somatic mutations. These
mutations are also co-coded by the disease cohort of the case in which they were detected. d VAF of each mutation (SRM: purple, or MRM: green) within

Bioinformatic pipeline. The bioinformatic pipeline is shown in Fig. 1e and in
detail in Supplementary Figure 2. In overview, the primary calling pipeline
included variants called by either MuTect28 or Varscan29,10 at a minimum VAF of
0.5%, before deepSNV11,12 confirmed the presence of the detected variants in
identified samples, and also confirmed that the VAF of detected somatic variants
alleles in other brain regions was no different to the base error rate of other samples
(where appropriate, Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 2). The primary analysis was
performed on the ACE data, and subsequently validated by the HaloplexHS
platform.
ACE platform—SNVs and small indels were called using MuTect2 and
Varscan2 Somatic Calling with the default parameters within the BED file for
neurodegenerative and cancer ‘control’ genes. To detect SRMs we ran two callers
on all possible sample pairs from one individual allocating each sample as the
‘germline’ or ‘tissue’ sample in turn. MRMs were called using Varscan single-
sample Calling with VAF > 0.1% which may not be detected by paired calling,
particularly in equivocal VAF between samples. We subsequently excluded
variants: (1) with <1000 total read depth; (2) with <10 mutant reads; (3) <4 reads
from either the forward or reverse strand; (4) those called as germline variants; (5)
variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) > 1% in 1000 genome project
database46, NHLBI ESP6500 (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/) or ExAC
database47 and (6) those within simple tandem repeats, segmental duplications,
and microsatellites. All candidate mutations were subsequently annotated by
ANNOVAR48. The same approach was used to analyse brain and blood
combinations with a VAF > 0.5% based on spiked control sample data.
To ensure SRMs were truly focal, we utilised an additional caller to maximise
the value of our large homogenous dataset (n = 173 samples at a mean coverage of
5374×) which ensured that identified SRMs and MRMs did differ from the base
error rate seen in other samples. The deepSNV caller enabled us to build a separate
error model for each base, and test whether the variant allele detected in the sample
is greater than that expected from a beta-binomial distribution with an associated
over dispersion factor which captures the observed degree of variation within the
control samples. Testing this variant caller in spiked control samples (Fig. 1b)
showed this caller to be the most specific caller of all those tested. To validate the
focal variants, we ran deepSNV using other samples from the same individual as
reference samples with a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected P value for the number of
samples tested. This ensured SRMs were: (1) identified by MuTect2 or VarScan2
Somatic Calling as present in only one region; (2) significantly different to all other
samples within that individual (e.g., in the cerebellum and frontal cortex when
detected in medulla); (3) significantly different from all other samples from all
other individuals (n = 169 or n = 170) at the corrected threshold and (4) any other
samples (e.g., frontal cortex and cerebellum) within that individual did not differ to
all other samples from other individuals. MRMs were defined as variants with a
VAF between 0.5% and 20% called in a single sample by Varscan2, and which were
present in more than one region within the same individual. These putative MRMs
were confirmed with deepSNV using the samples from other individuals as
reference samples, and therefore MRMs were defined as follows: (1) as any variant
identified by VarScan 2 single-sample calling to be present in more than one
region; and which, (2) did again significantly differ to all other samples from other
individuals at the corrected threshold.
Haloplex platform—To determine the accuracy of this approach, we validated
identified variants using the HaloplexHS system data. In total 89.5% bases within
the target region were covered above ×1000 and 94.3% bases were covered above
×500 (99.4% bases with coverage above ×1000 covered by ACE). In all, 62 variants
were called initially on the ACE platform, and 56 (90.5%) were covered above ×500
on the HaloplexHS platform. The remaining six variants had VAF of >1% on the
ACE platform in all but one case, with the remaining sample having a VAF of
0.53%. Given the high specificity of our approach using the ACE platform at the
0.5% threshold (98.25% Sensitivity and 100% Specificity) we considered these
variants to be present with confidence. We also manually reviewed and confirmed
the read alignments for all 62 somatic mutations detected on the ACE platform and
56 covered by HaloplexHS using IGV software (v.2.3)49 confirming their presence.
Comparison of the detected VAF from each platform showed a strong
correlation for the 56 variants (r2 = 0.953, P < 2.2e−16) (Fig. 2b). These data
indicate that our detection of somatic mutations was highly specific, and given that
the DNA was independently amplified and sequenced, are highly unlikely to be due
to amplification artefact.
Further QC steps: we ensured that all brain samples were from the same
individual by performing identity by descent analysis based on called germline
variants (see above) from both Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK v3.5)50–52 and
Varscan2. Stringent QC filters were applied to remove poorly performing samples
using PLINK v1.07 (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink/)53. Single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a minor allele frequency of <40%,
genotyping rate <95% or SNPs showing departure from Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium (p < 1 × 10−8) were excluded. Kinship coefficients were determined
across the dataset as measured by the PI_HAT score in PLINK. Any sample with a
PI_HAT score of >0.95 compared to any other sample from the same individual
was removed and considered a duplication. This approach removed 6 samples as
being incorrectly identified from 179 initial samples, leaving 173 samples within the
final cohort.
The possibility of contamination from other samples was extremely unlikely
because the MAF of all detected somatic alleles was <1% in reference databases
(1000 genome, ExAc and ESP6500) in all cases, meaning that they are extremely
rare in the population. All somatic variants were also cross-referenced with
germline SNPs from cases within the Newcastle NBTR Brain Bank, in which 328
post-mortem brains have previously undergone Exome Sequencing54. No somatic
variants in our current study were present in the heterozygous or homozygous state
in that dataset.
Mathematical analysis of mutation frequency. Ultimately the brain, as with all
organs, is derived from the single-cell zygote, so we modelled the process of brain
development from fertilisation to account for potential somatic mutations that
occurred before organogenesis. The branching model began with a single wild-type
founder cell, and divided 37 times with zero probability of cell death, producing
two daughters per division. Non-zero levels of cell death are explored in Supple-
mentary Note 1. For the neurodegenerative disease genes, each base was modelled
to have a constant probability of mutation per cell division. Using data for the case
cohort, we used the approximate Bayesian computation rejection algorithm, with
summary statistics of the data, to infer the somatic mutation rate per cell division
during neurodevelopment based on this model. We used a broad uninformative
prior for the mutation rate, spanning 4 orders of magnitude. With this, we
simulated the development of the cell population in the brain as a branching
process with 37 divisions required to generate the final cell population of neurons
and non-neurons in approximately equal proportions55. By using one sample per
individual from the approximate posterior distribution, we generalised the pre-
valence of pathological neuronal mutations to larger population sizes than those
measured experimentally. See Supplementary Methods for further details.
Quantification and statistical analysis. All statistical calculations were performed
as described in the text, with un-corrected P values shown, and the corrected
P value provided for comparison where relevant.

 All samples throughout the study were given an anonymous sample ID and
were randomly assigned to sequencing runs. Sample sizes were performed as
calculated below. Biological replicates from brain tissue samples were performed on
an orthogonal sequencing platform as described in the text after biological
replicates were used for spiked HapMap control data revealing high concordance.
Confidence intervals for observed variant AFs. In order to account for potential
effects of sampling error in the determination of the VAF on the ACE platform, we
calculated the normal approximation interval based upon the total read depth at
each somatic allele site, and the number of variant reads observed.

 Power calculations. To calculate the number of samples required from of any
neurodegenerative disease (e.g., LB disease or AD) and controls that would give
90% power with 95% confidence (assuming a type 1 error rate of 5%), to detect
double the frequency of somatic mutations in case genes (26%) in any disease
cohort compared to controls (13%) (assuming equal matching), we used the fol-
lowing equation:
nA ¼ knB and nB ¼

where k is the matching ratio (assuming a 1:1 ratio between cases and controls), α
is the Type 1 error and β is the type II error.
