BACKGROUND: Perioperative myocardial injury (PMI) seems to be a contributor 
to mortality after noncardiac surgery. Because the vast majority of PMIs are 
asymptomatic, PMI usually is missed in the absence of systematic screening.
METHODS: We performed a prospective diagnostic study enrolling 
consecutive patients undergoing noncardiac surgery who had a planned 
postoperative stay of ≥24 hours and were considered at increased 
cardiovascular risk. All patients received a systematic screening using serial 
measurements of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T in clinical routine. PMI 
was defined as an absolute high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T increase of 
≥14 ng/L from preoperative to postoperative measurements. Furthermore, 
mortality was compared among patients with PMI not fulfilling additional 
criteria (ischemic symptoms, new ECG changes, or imaging evidence of 
loss of viable myocardium) required for the diagnosis of spontaneous acute 
myocardial infarction versus those that did.
RESULTS: From 2014 to 2015 we included 2018 consecutive patients 
undergoing 2546 surgeries. Patients had a median age of 74 years and 42% 
were women. PMI occurred after 397 of 2546 surgeries (16%; 95% confidence 
interval, 14%–17%) and was accompanied by typical chest pain in 24 of 397 
patients (6%) and any ischemic symptoms in 72 of 397 (18%). Crude 30-
day mortality was 8.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.7–12.0) in patients 
with PMI versus 1.5% (95% CI, 0.9–2.0) in patients without PMI (P<0.001). 
Multivariable regression analysis showed an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.7 (95% 
CI, 1.5–4.8) for 30-day mortality. The difference was retained at 1 year with 
mortality rates of 22.5% (95% CI, 17.6–27.4) versus 9.3% (95% CI, 7.9–10.7). 
Thirty-day mortality was comparable among patients with PMI not fulfilling 
any other of the additional criteria required for spontaneous acute myocardial 
infarction (280/397, 71%) versus those with at least 1 additional criterion 
(10.4%; 95% CI, 6.7–15.7, versus 8.7%; 95% CI, 4.2–16.7; P=0.684).
CONCLUSIONS: PMI is a common complication after noncardiac surgery 
and, despite early detection during routine clinical screening, is associated 
with substantial short- and long-term mortality. Mortality seems comparable 
in patients with PMI not fulfilling any other of the additional criteria required 
for spontaneous acute myocardial infarction versus those patients who do.

Myocardial Injury After Noncardiac Surgery 
P
erioperative myocardial injury (PMI) has recently 
been identified as an important, yet often un-
detected complication after noncardiac surgery, 
strongly associated with 30-day mortality.1–5 In contrast 
with spontaneous myocardial infarction (MI), PMI most 
commonly does not exhibit typical symptoms of myo-
cardial ischemia, such as chest pain, angina pectoris, 
or dyspnea, and is therefore missed in routine clinical 
practice in most institutions in the United States and 
worldwide.1–5
Considering that >300 million surgeries are per-
formed annually and that demographic change is re-
sulting in an increasing number of surgical patients 
with elevated cardiovascular risk, strategies to improve 
the detection, treatment, and outcome of PMI may 
have the potential to provide major medical benefits. 
A missed diagnosis inevitably leads to a missed chance 
for treatment. Therefore, rapid and reliable detection 
of PMI is a crucial first step in efforts aiming to improve 
outcomes of this underappreciated perioperative com-
plication. Because ECG also has very low sensitivity,6 the 
detection and quantification of acute cardiomyocyte in-
jury by measuring cardiac troponin (cTn) is critical for 
the clinical diagnosis of PMI.7,8
Recently, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) 
assays have been introduced into routine clinical care, 
allowing for the first time the precise detection of acute 
cardiomyocyte injury attributable to PMI by using pre-
operative and postoperative hs-cTn measurements.9 
The differentiation between PMI and chronic elevations 
in hs-cTn attributable to chronic cardiac disorders ap-
pears paramount for the successful development of 
strategies to tackle the excess mortality associated with 
PMI while avoiding overtreatment.
Based on recommendations to screen high-risk pa-
tients undergoing noncardiac surgery for PMI,7,8 our 
institution initiated a PMI screening program with a 
structured response system embedded within clinical 
routine. The aims of the present study were to (1) assess 
the incidence of PMI detected by a screening program 
implemented into clinical routine, which included both 
pre- and postoperative measurements of high-sensitiv-
ity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT); (2) evaluate its associa-
tion with 30-day and 1-year mortality.
METHODS
We adhered to the STROBE reporting guidelines, with further 
information found in the online-only Data Supplement. The 
data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be made 
available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the 
results or replicating the procedure.
Patients
We included consecutive patients undergoing noncardiac sur-
gery at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, who were 
eligible for the institutional routine hs-cTn monitoring pro-
gram and provided written general consent to registration in 
a dedicated prospective database. Because the monitoring 
program was institutional routine, patients did not specifically 
consent to this standard of care. The study was approved by 
the local ethics committee (NCT02573532).
Routine screening for PMI was implemented in October 
2014 as part of the standard of care for high-risk patients 
undergoing inpatient noncardiac surgery. Patients were 
screened if they had a planned hospital stay exceeding 24 
hours after surgery and were considered at increased mortal-
ity risk, defined as ≥65 years of age, or ≥45 years with history 
of coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, or stroke. 
Plasma concentrations of hs-cTnT were measured within 30 
days before surgery and on postoperative days 1 and 2, and 
later if clinically indicated.
Screening was implemented for patients undergoing 
visceral, orthopedic, trauma, vascular, urologic, spinal, and 
thoracic surgical procedures. To improve compliance with 
the screening program, clinicians were alerted automatically 
of eligibility to the program based on the electronic health 
records. Serial hs-cTnT measurements were ordered by the 
treating anesthesiologist. Patients underwent hs-cTnT moni-
toring and were registered into the database multiple times if 
a minimum of 5 days had elapsed between procedures.
End Points
PMI was prospectively defined as an absolute increase in hs-
cTnT of ≥14 ng/L above preoperative values (or between 2 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• In patients with high cardiovascular risk, periopera-
tive myocardial injury (PMI) detected and quanti-
fied by an acute increase in high-sensitivity cardiac 
troponin T plasma concentrations is a common 
complication after noncardiac surgery occurring in 
1 of 7 patients.
• Only 6% of patients with PMI experience typical 
chest pain, clearly indicating major differences 
from spontaneous myocardial infarction.
• PMI is associated with substantial 30-day and 1-year 
mortality (9% and 22%), with similar mortality in 
patients with PMI not fulfilling the additional cri-
teria for spontaneous myocardial infarction criteria 
versus those who do.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Major differences between PMI and spontaneous 
myocardial infarction mandate scrutiny in the indi-
vidualized selection of treatment strategies after PMI.
• The high-risk criteria used in this study (≥65 years 
of age or preexisting atherosclerotic disease) 
deserve replication in clinical screening programs 
and research studies aiming at improving 30-day 
mortality.

postoperative values if the preoperative value was missing) 
within 7 days of surgery. Based on findings from prior stud-
ies showing that asymptomatic elevations in cTn were also 
associated with increased short-term mortality,1 we chose 
to not mandate specific symptoms or specific ECG changes 
into the definition of PMI. We used delta values instead of 
maximum postoperative levels to ensure that our definition 
reflected acute myocardial damage and was time related to 
surgery, thus avoiding misclassification of chronically elevated 
levels. Chronic hs-cTn elevations are expected in a relevant 
amount of (surgical) patients,10 and were previously shown 
to be independently associated with increased risk of death 
and major adverse cardiac events.11 We chose an absolute 
rather than a relative delta hs-cTnT level for the diagnosis of 
PMI, because absolute changes have shown higher diagnos-
tic accuracy than relative changes in the detection of acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI) in the nonoperative setting.12,13 
The absolute increase of ≥14 ng/L was selected because 14 
ng/L represents the 99th percentile of healthy individuals, 
and, thereby, all PMIs invariably would fulfill the change, and 
the absolute cTn criteria, as well, required for the diagnosis of 
spontaneous AMI.8
PMI was centrally adjudicated by 2 independent experts 
based on all clinical information obtained during index hos-
pitalization, including ECG, serial laboratory measurements 
including hs-cTnT and hemoglobin, monitoring of vital signs 
in the perioperative and intraoperative period, echocardiogra-
phy, cardiac stress testing, and coronary angiography, if per-
formed. Two subtypes of PMI were classified: extracardiac in 
which a primarily extracardiac disease such as severe sepsis, 
stroke, or pulmonary embolism triggered PMI, and cardiac 
for all other cases. In cases of disagreement between the 2 
reviewers, consensus was sought and found by discussion 
with a third senior physician.
We further characterized patients as to whether PMI 
also fulfilled at least one of the additional criteria required 
for the diagnosis of spontaneous AMI.8 Because all PMI nec-
essarily fulfilled the cTn criteria, ≥1 of the following was 
required: the presence of ischemic symptoms, new or pre-
sumed new significant ST-segment–T wave changes or new 
left bundle-branch block, development of pathological Q 
waves in the ECG, imaging evidence of a new loss of via-
ble myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality, 
and identification of an intracoronary thrombus by angi-
ography or autopsy.8 The primary event-related prognostic 
end point was 30-day mortality, and 1-year mortality was 
the secondary prognostic end point. Deaths were classified 
as cardiovascular or noncardiovascular according to recent 
guidelines.14 Cardiovascular death included death attribut-
able to AMI, sudden cardiac death, heart failure, stroke, 
cardiovascular procedure, cardiovascular hemorrhage (eg, 
ruptured aortic aneurysm or dissection), and pulmonary 
embolism. All deaths were assumed to be cardiovascular 
in nature unless evidence of a noncardiovascular cause 
was available. Noncardiovascular death included all deaths 
attributable to a clearly documented noncardiac and non-
vascular cause, such as respiratory failure (excluding car-
diogenic pulmonary edema), infections/sepsis, neoplasm, 
trauma (including suicide and homicide), and surgical or 
gastrointestinal bleeding.14
Procedures
In case of an absolute increase in hs-cTnT of ≥14 ng/L above 
preoperative levels, structured response included assessing 
patients identified with PMI for possible symptoms related 
to PMI and recording of a 12-lead ECG by study staff. In 
addition, a cardiology consultation request was triggered 
electronically. To address the anticipated problem of insuf-
ficient staffing for the substantial number of additional cardi-
ology consultations, particularly during the weekends, it was 
predefined at the start of the PMI-screening program that, 
in general, no cardiology consultations attributable to PMI 
would be performed during the weekends, on public holi-
days, whenever the cardiologist on call was busy with other, 
more urgent patients, and in case the patient was currently 
treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) at the time of PMI 
detection, because these patients already received intense 
interdisciplinary care. Nonetheless, hs-cTnT measurements 
were always available for the treating physician irrespective 
of the day of the week. All cardiologists providing cardiology 
consultation after PMI were continuously instructed in a pre-
defined management scheme for PMI (Figure I in the online-
only Data Supplement). All treatment decisions regarding 
PMI were made by the treating surgeon in conjunction with 
the consulting cardiologist.
We excluded patients who were incorrectly screened (<45 
years, <24-hour hospital stay, surgery involving the heart), 
had their surgery cancelled, had cardiac surgery or MI within 
14 days before surgery, if only 1 hs-cTnT concentration was 
measured, or if postoperative hs-cTnT concentrations were 
elevated without a dynamic change (≥14 ng/L), and preop-
erative baseline levels were missing. For the analysis address-
ing 30-day and 1-year mortality, we included every patient 
only once at first enrollment (Figure II in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
Data Collection
The Revised Cardiac Risk Index was calculated for all 
patients.15 The cardiovascular risk of surgery was classified 
as proposed by the European Society of Cardiology and the 
European Society of Anaesthesiology.7 During the hospital-
ization period, we recorded complications (sepsis, stroke, 
pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, postoperative delirium). 
Patient symptoms during PMI were extracted from the car-
diology consultation report if available, or from electronic 
health records from the day first exceeding the hs-cTnT–delta 
threshold of ≥14 ng/L. Recommendations given in the cardi-
ology consultations were collected from the electronic health 
records.
During follow-up, patients were contacted after 1 year by 
mail or telephone, and local death registries checked. In case 
of suspicion of an outcome event, study personnel requested 
reports from the general practitioners, treating facilities, or 
death registries. Patients lost to follow-up were censored at 
the last contact with the study team, a hospital, or their gen-
eral practitioner.
Hs-cTnT Measurements
Hs-cTnT was measured by using an Elecsys System using 
the Modular Analytics E170 or the Cobas e602 (Roche

Diagnostics) assay with a limit of detection of 5 ng/L, a 10% 
coefficient of variation at 13 ng/L, and the 99th percentile 
of a healthy reference population at 14 ng/L.16 Hs-cTnT was 
measured within 30 days before surgery, with 83% being 
measured within 1 day before surgery and 94% being mea-
sured within 3 days before surgery.
Statistical Analysis
The incidence of PMI was calculated with 95% confidence 
intervals (95% CIs) by the method proposed by Agresti 
and Coull.17 PMI incidence was stratified by surgical disci-
plines, European Society of Cardiology/European Society of 
Anaesthesiology surgical risk,7 and postoperative stay on a 
regular ward or the ICU. The association of PMI with crude 
all-cause mortality was evaluated by using Kaplan-Meier 
curves and the log-rank test. To quantify the potential inde-
pendent effect of preexisting chronic cardiomyocyte injury 
and acute perioperative cardiomyocyte injury (PMI), we 
included an analysis that stratified patients into 4 groups 
according to baseline troponin (low versus elevated) and 
PMI (acute perioperative elevation present or not). To deter-
mine adjusted hazard ratios (HRs), we performed multivari-
able regression analyses with time to all-cause death as a 
dependent variable. After evaluation of Schoenfeld residuals, 
a Cox proportional hazards model was chosen, and the HRs 
for PMI and its subtypes were calculated adjusted for the pre-
defined covariables age, nonelective surgery, Revised Cardiac 
Risk Index, and complications during hospital stay (sepsis, 
stroke, or pneumonia). Based on the number of events and 
the consensus of requiring 10 events per independent vari-
able compared in regression models, we were able to address 
6 variables.18
Sensitivity Analyses
As reported in the flow chart, missing hs-cTnT measurements 
prevented definitive PMI adjudication in a subset of patients. 
We compared the baseline characteristics of these excluded 
patients with the analyzed cohort (Table I in the online-only 
Data Supplement).
To evaluate the validity of our outcome analysis, we con-
ducted sensitivity analyses and reran the 30-day mortality 
model (a) including only cases with complete hs-cTnT mea-
surements preoperative and in the first 2 postoperative days 
(complete case mode), and (b) censoring all patients if they 
had a repeat surgery leading to a PMI within 30 days at the 
time of this later PMI (later PMI censoring).
Hs-cTnT Investigations
To explore the association of absolute hs-cTnT increase and 
maximum postoperative hs-cTnT level within 7 days of surgery 
with 30-day mortality, we plotted 30-day mortality according 
to the increase in and maximum postoperative levels of hs-
cTnT using a Loess function using 97.5% of data points.
To evaluate the interaction of preoperative elevations in 
hs-cTnT ≥14 ng/L and PMI, we classified the patients accord-
ing to PMI status and presence of preoperative hs-cTnT eleva-
tion, and constructed Kaplan-Meier curves.
Analysis was done using SPSS 22 and R 3.3 (survival, 
survminer).
RESULTS
Between October 2014 and November 2015, 2350 
patients undergoing 2973 surgeries were screened for 
PMI. Of these, 2018 patients undergoing 2546 surger-
ies were eligible for this analysis (Figure II in the online-
only Data Supplement).
Incidence of PMI
PMI occurred after 397 of 2546 surgeries (16%; 95% 
CI, 14%–17%). Patients with PMI had more cardiovas-
cular comorbidities and, consequently, a higher Revised 
Cardiac Risk Index, and a higher rate of nonelective 
surgery (Table 1). The incidence of PMI increased with 
higher European Society of Cardiology/European So-
ciety of Anaesthesiology risk category of the surgical 
procedure from 9% in the lowest to 25% in the highest 
category (Table II in the online-only Data Supplement).

Myocardial Injury After Noncardiac Surgery 
PMI incidence differed in patients treated on the surgi-
cal ward, patients staying in the ICU for a short period, 
and patients with prolonged stay (≥2 days), with 13% 
(95% CI, 12–15), 19% (95% CI, 15–23), and 56% 
(95% CI, 46–65), respectively.
The majority of patients with PMI, 325 of 397 (82%), 
did not show any ischemic symptoms, and chest pain 
was only present in 24 of 397 (6%). ECG findings sug-
gestive of myocardial ischemia, especially ST-segment 
depression or T-wave inversion, were observed in 60 
of 244 (24%) of ECGs performed. Together with an 
additional 7 patients showing evidence of loss of vi-
able myocardium on imaging, overall only 117 of 397 
(29%) of patients fulfilled any of the additional criteria 
required for spontaneous AMI (Table 2).
PMI Subtypes
Three hundred forty-two of 397 PMI (86%; 95% CI; 
82–89) were classified as primarily cardiac and 55 of 
397 (14%; 95% CI, 10–18) as primarily extracardiac 
subtypes. The causes for primarily extracardiac PMI 
were severe sepsis or uncontrolled infection in 40 of 
55 patients. The proportion of extracardiac PMI differed 
between patients treated on the surgical ward (9%; 
95% CI, 6–12), patients staying in the ICU for a short 
period (16%; 95% CI, 9–27), and patients with pro-
longed ICU stay ≥2 days (38%; 95% CI, 26–51).
Mortality Associated With PMI
Among 2018 patients eligible for analysis, 30-day 
follow-up was complete in 99.9%, and 1-year follow-
up was complete in 99.6% of patients. Overall, 56 of 
2018 patients (2.8%; 95% CI, 2.1–3.6) died within 
30 days; 23 (41%; 95% CI, 29–54) died of cardiovas-
cular causes and 33 (59%; 95% CI, 46–71) died of 
noncardiovascular causes. One year after surgery, 224 
of 2018 (11.2%; 95% CI, 9.8–12.7) patients died; 71 
(32%; 95% CI, 26–38) died of cardiovascular causes 
and 153 (68%; 95% CI, 62–74) died of noncardiovas-
cular causes. Data on the surgical course and hospital 
stay can be seen in Table III in the online-only Data 
Supplement, and the number of cardiology consulta-
tions, cardiac imaging, and changes in cardiovascular 
medication can be seen in Table IV in the online-only 
Data Supplement.
At 30 days, 28 of 285 (9.8%; 95% CI, 6.8–14.0) 
patients with PMI versus 28 of 1733 (1.6%; 95% CI, 
1.1–2.4; P<0.001) patients without PMI had died (Fig-
ure 1A). Cardiovascular death occurred in 14 of 285 
(4.9%; 95% CI, 2.8–8.2) patients with PMI in compari-
son with 9 of 1733 (0.5%; 95% CI, 0.3–1.0) patients 
without PMI.
At 1 year, 64 of 285 (22.5%; 95% CI, 17.9–27.8) 
patients with PMI versus 160 of 1733 (9.3%; 95% CI, 
8.0–10.8; P<0.001) patients without PMI had died (Fig-
ure 1B). Cardiovascular death occurred in 26 of 285 
(9.1%; 95% CI, 6.2–13.2) patients with PMI in com-
parison with 45 of 1733 (2.6%; 95% CI, 1.9–3.5) pa-
tients without PMI.
In multivariate regression analysis, PMI was associ-
ated with a HR of 2.7 (95% CI, 1.5–4.8; P=0.001) for 
30-day mortality, and a HR of 1.6 (95% CI, 1.2–2.2; 
P=0.003) for 1-year mortality (Table 3).
Patients with PMI not fulfilling additional criteria re-
quired for spontaneous AMI had comparable 30-day 
mortality and 1-year mortality rates to patients with 
PMI fulfilling ≥1 of the additional criteria required for 
spontaneous AMI (10.4% [95% CI, 6.7–15.7] versus 
8.7% [95% CI, 4.2–16.7]; P=0.684 and 22.1% [95% 
CI, 17.6–27.5] versus 29.1% [95% CI, 21.4–38.1]; 
P=0.47; Figure 2). When analyzing different PMI sub-
types, 30-day mortality was 15 of 245 (6.1%; 95% CI, 
3.6–10.0) versus 13 of 40 (32.5%; 95% CI, 19.8–48.4;

diac and extracardiac subtype, respectively. In the group 
of patients with cardiac PMI, 60% of deaths within 30 
days of surgery were cardiovascular, in comparison with 
39% in patients with extracardiac subtype.
At 1 year, 49 of 245 (20%; 95% CI, 15–26) pa-
tients with a cardiac PMI versus 15 of 40 (38%; 95% 
CI, 24–53) patients with an extracardiac PMI had 
died. In the group of patients with cardiac PMI, 43% 
of deaths within 1 year of surgery were cardiovascu-
lar, in comparison with 33% in patients with extra-
cardiac PMI.
Results From the Sensitivity Analyses
In the complete-case sensitivity analysis (n=1829), in-
cluding only cases with complete hs-cTnT measure-
ments preoperative and on the first 2 postoperative 
days, the adjusted HR for 30-day mortality of PMI was 
2.8 (95% CI, 1.6–5.2).
In the later PMI censoring sensitivity analysis 
(n=2018), censoring patients if they had a repeat sur-
gery leading to a PMI, we found the 30-day mortality 
HR of PMI to be 3.2 (95% CI, 1.8–5.8).

Myocardial Injury After Noncardiac Surgery 
Association of hs-cTnT With 30-Day 
Mortality
In our cohort, 1261 (51%) of all patients already had 
preoperatively hs-cTnT levels at or above the 99th per-
centile of 14 ng/L, with patients with PMI showing an 
even higher proportion of 80% (Table 4). One thousand 
nine hundred thirty-six of 2546 (76%) patients had an 
increase of hs-cTnT levels postoperative in comparison 
with preoperative values, with the median increase in 
the total population being 3 ng/L (IQR, 1–8; Table 4). 
Postoperatively, 1626 of 2546 (64%) patients had a 
postoperative level ≥99th percentile of 14 ng/L.
When plotting 30-day mortality according to ab-
solute hs-cTnT increase and maximum postoperative 
hs-cTnT levels, both plots indicated rather stable low 
mortality rates for very low delta (≤5 ng/L, 68% of the 
cohort) and low maximum values (≤10 ng/L, 25% of 
the cohort). Although, for maximum postoperative hs-
cTnT values, this was followed by a gradual near-linear 
increase, the association between hs-cTnT increase and 
mortality seemed to exhibit different slopes >5 ng/L 
(Figure 3).
When evaluating the interaction of preoperative hs-
cTnT elevations and PMI, we found that PMI was associ-
ated with a worse outcome irrespective of preoperative 
values, but overall mortality was higher in patients with 
preexisting preoperative hs-cTnT elevations above the 
99th percentile (Figure 4).
DISCUSSION
This diagnostic study using central adjudication was 
embedded within a PMI-screening program imple-
mented as part of routine clinical practice and aimed 
to contribute to a better understanding of PMI as an 
often neglected and underestimated complication after 
noncardiac surgery.7,8 We report 6 major findings.
First, the incidence of PMI after noncardiac surgery 
detected during routine clinical screening in patients 
at increased cardiovascular risk is very high. One of 7 
patients >65 years of age or with preexisting coronary 
artery disease, peripheral artery disease, or stroke de-
veloped PMI. These findings extend and corroborate 
previous work on PMI, particularly the VISION study 
(Vascular Events in Noncardiac Surgery Patients Cohort 
Evaluation).1,3–5,9 The incidence of PMI observed in our 
study was comparable to that observed, eg, in VISION 
if using a comparable absolute hs-cTnT-delta criteri-
on.1,3–5,9 Differences in observed incidence rates found 
in several previous studies seem to relate to differences 
in the study populations, definitions of PMI, and the 
cTn assays used.1,3–5,9 The VISION study included pa-
tients >45 years (mean age, 63 years) irrespective of 
preexisting coronary artery disease or peripheral artery 
disease, and therefore at lower cardiovascular risk than 
in this study (median age, 74 years). Accordingly, 30-
day mortality in this study was twice that observed in 
VISION. In VISION, multiple cutoff values of maximum 
postoperative hs-cTnT levels defining an event were ret-
rospectively chosen, with, eg, ≥20 ng/L resulting in a 
PMI incidence of 17.9%.5 In our cohort, median preop-
erative hs-cTnT concentration was 14 ng/L, and the me-
dian maximum postoperative concentration in patients 
adjudicated to have PMI was 64 ng/L. Regarding the 
definition of PMI, the high frequency of elevated hs-cTn 
plasma concentrations before surgery observed in this 
study (51%), VISION, and other studies clearly highlight 
the need for a definition that takes preoperative hs-cTn 
levels into consideration to avoid misclassification of 
chronic hs-cTn elevations as PMI.4,5,9,19
Second, clinical presentation of PMI differed mark-
edly from that of spontaneous AMI.8 Among patients 
with PMI, only 6% had typical chest pain, 18% had any 
ischemic symptoms, and 29% fulfilled additional crite-
ria required for spontaneous AMI beyond the increase 
in hs-cTnT. These prospective observations corroborate 
that these acute events would in the vast majority have 
been missed in the absence of systematic screening.1–5
Third, patients with PMI had 6 times the 30-day mor-
tality observed in patients without PMI, despite the early

detection within the clinical screening program. The ex-
cess mortality associated with PMI persisted up to 1 year.
Thirty-day mortality was comparable among patients 
with PMI not fulfilling any other of the additional criteria 
required for spontaneous AMI (ischemic symptoms, new 
ECG changes, imaging evidence of loss of viable myo-
cardium) versus those with at least 1 additional criterion. 
Similar observations were made in VISION, adding to the 
ongoing controversy of what criteria should be applied 
in the definition of perioperative MI in addition to the 
documentation of acute cardiomyocyte injury.1,5–8,20
Fourth, PMI associated with a primarily extracardiac 
disorder triggering cardiomyocyte injury such as severe 
sepsis has even worse prognosis with 1 of 3 patients 
dying within 30 days.
Fifth, acute cardiomyocyte injury occurring in the peri-
operative period (PMI) had additive and possibly amplify-
ing detrimental effects on 30-day and 1-year mortality 
on top of chronic cardiomyocyte injury attributable to 
various chronic cardiovascular disorders present before 
the operation. Accordingly, PMI was associated with 
increased mortality in patients presenting with low pre-
operative hs-cTnT concentrations, and elevated preop-
erative hs-cTnT concentrations, as well. In fact, the asso-
ciation between the amount of cardiomyocyte injury as 
quantified by hs-cTnT plasma concentration and mortal-
ity seemed to be continuous. Increasing absolute hs-cTnT 
deltas, and increasing postoperative maximum hs-cTnT 
concentrations, as well, were associated with increasing 
mortality rates. Although the association between post-
operative maximum hs-cTnT concentrations and mortal-
ity seemed to be near linear in hs-cTnT concentrations 
>10 ng/L, the association between absolute hs-cTnT del-
tas and mortality seemed biphasic above deltas of 5 ng/L.
Sixth, after detailed review of all clinical information 
pertaining to the individual patient, coronary angiogra-
phy was recommended by the cardiology consultant in 
only 10% of patients with PMI. This highlights that the 
dominant pathophysiological mechanisms and the asso-
ciated optimal management of patients with PMI is likely 
fundamentally different from that of patients with spon-
taneous MI. In the majority of patients with PMI, cardio-
myocyte injury seems to be caused by supply-demand 
mismatch attributable to hypotension, anemia, and 
tachycardia rather than plaque rupture.20–22 However, 
these patients also had high cardiovascular mortality and 
may benefit from intensification of medical treatment.23
These findings extend and corroborate previous work 
on PMI and efforts aimed at improving outcomes after 
noncardiac surgery1,2,4–6,19 The high incidence of PMI and 
the high mortality rate observed in this study suggest that 
the specific selection criteria used to identify high-risk pa-
tients deserve to be replicated in future studies. Ideally, 
these should include a randomized controlled trial testing 
the effect of active surveillance combined with an active 
response protocol on clinical and economic outcomes.
Figure 2. Perioperative myocardial injuries not fulfilling versus fulfilling additional criteria for spontaneous  
infarction.  
Cumulative all-cause mortality within 30 days and 1 year of patients with perioperative myocardial injury (PMI), split according 
to whether patients not fulfilling any of the additional criteria required for the diagnosis of spontaneous acute myocardial in-
farction besides the cardiac troponin criterion (ischemic symptoms, or ischemic signs on ECG or on cardiac imaging) or if they 
fulfill at least one of the additional criteria.

Myocardial Injury After Noncardiac Surgery 
Strengths
Strengths of this study include the implementation of 
PMI screening in clinical routine, prospective assess-
ment of symptoms possibly associated with PMI, cen-
tral adjudication, use of hs-cTnT including preoperative 
measurements to reliably distinguish PMI from chronic 
hs-cTnT elevations from chronic cardiac disorders, long-
term follow-up, and very high completeness of follow-
up (eg, 99.9% at 30 days).
Limitations
The following limitations should be considered when 
interpreting these findings. First, there is no univer-
sally accepted definition of PMI. The absolute hs-cTnT 
change criteria used to define PMI in this study are, at 
large, arbitrary. Although the hs-cTn cutoff criteria for 
spontaneous MI (99th percentile of healthy individuals) 
also are arbitrary, they are widely accepted and based 
on broad consensus. Our criterion for PMI is supported 
by recent data from VISION, but still requires approval 
by expert groups.8 Second, hs-cTnT was measured rou-
tinely in the first 2 days after surgery, and afterward 
only in case of clinical suspicion of MI. Therefore, a 
small number of asymptomatic PMIs occurring after the 
first days invariably were missed. Accordingly, our point 
estimates slightly underestimate the true incidence of 
PMI.2,5 Third, the adjudication of PMI subtypes into car-
diac and extracardiac PMI was largely based on clinical 
criteria, because the majority of patients did not un-
dergo coronary angiography.
CONCLUSION
PMI is a common complication after noncardiac sur-
gery and, despite early detection during routine clinical 
screening, is associated with substantial short- and long-

patients with perioperative myocardial injury in clinical routine at hs-cTnT deltas of ≥14 ng/L, this threshold was highlighted in 
the plot of absolute hs-cTnT increase (green dashed line).
