Abstract
The hypoxia inducible factor, HIF-1 is a central regulator of the response to low oxygen or 
inflammatory stress and plays an essential role in the survival and function of immune cells. 
However, the mechanisms regulating non-hypoxic induction of HIF-1 remain unclear. Here, we 
assess the impact of germline heterozygosity of a novel, oxygen independent ubiquitin ligase for 
HIF-1α; the hypoxia associated factor, HAF (encoded by SART1). SART1−/− mice were 
embryonic lethal, whereas male SART1+/− mice spontaneously recapitulated key features of non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) driven HCC including steatosis, fibrosis and inflammatory 
cytokine production. Male but not female SART1+/− mice showed significant upregulation of 
HIF-1α in circulating and liver-infiltrating immune cells but not in hepatocytes prior to the 
development of malignancy. Additionally, Kupffer cells derived from male but not female 
SART1+/− mice produced increased levels of the HIF-1 dependent chemokine, RANTES, 
compared to wild-type. This was associated with increased liver-neutrophilic infiltration whereas 
infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages were not significantly different. Neutralization of 
circulating RANTES decreased liver neutrophilic infiltration, and attenuated HCC tumor 
initiation/growth in SART1+/− mice. Conclusion: We establish a new tumor suppressor role for 
HAF in immune cell function by preventing inappropriate HIF-1 activation in male mice, and 
identify RANTES as a novel therapeutic target for NASH and NASH-driven HCC.

 of inflammation, thus requiring infiltrating immune cells to undergo a metabolic switch 
towards anerobic pathways to maintain energy requirements. The hypoxia inducible factor 
(HIF) transcription factors are central regulators of the hypoxic response. The HIFs are 
heterodimers comprising one of three major oxygen labile HIF-α subunits (HIF-1α, HIF-2α 
and HIF-3α), and a constitutive HIF-1β subunit, which together form the HIF-1, HIF-2 and 
HIF-3 transcriptional complexes respectively (3). HIF-1 plays an essential role in the 
survival and function of immune cells, by facilitating energy generation through anerobic 
glycolysis (4). Under aerobic conditions, HIF-α is hydroxylated by oxygen-dependent 
prolyl-hydroxylases, promoting ubiquitination by the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL) E3 
ligase complex resulting in HIF-α proteasomal degradation (5). Under hypoxic conditions, 
pVHL binding is abrogated, HIF-α is stabilized and heterodimerizes with HIF-1β to 
transactivate a variety of hypoxia-responsive genes (6). HIF-1α can also be induced under 
non-hypoxic conditions by pro-inflammatory cytokines, which allow the initiation of an 
inflammatory response before tissues become hypoxic (4, 7). In addition to pVHL, the 
hypoxia associated factor, HAF (encoded by SART1), is an isoform specific E3 ubiquitin 
ligase that specifically degrades HIF-1α (but not HIF-2α), in an oxygen-independent manner 
(8). Also known as SART1, HAF is expressed in both normal and malignant proliferating 
tissue (9, 10), is important for spliceosome assembly (11), and cell division (12). Here, we 
address the physiological role of HAF.
Experimental Procedures
Generation of mice
The SART1+/− mice were derived from the Texas Institute for Genomic Medicine gene trap 
C57BL/6 SART1−/− ES cell line (Clone IST11321E11). Genotyping was performed using 
allele-specific PCR (Supplemental methods). All animal procedures were performed in 
accordance with institutional animal care and use protocols.
Gene expression analyses
Differential gene expression profiling of SART1+/− versus wild-type livers (3 replicates 
each) were performed using the GeneChip® Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array and the 3′ IVT 
PLUS Reagent Kit (Affymetrix, P/N 902416, Santa Clara CA); GEO Accession GSE71057. 
Data analysis was performed using Transcriptome Analysis Console 2.0, which generated 
the heatmaps, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen Inc., Valencia CA). Hit validation 
was performed by Taqman custom arrays (Life Technologies, Carlsbad CA).
Human liver sections
Human HCC (of unknown etiology, Fig 8A) was purchased from US Biomax Inc 
(Rockville, MD). Sections in Fig 8B-D were from formalin fixed paraffin-embedded non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated HCC tumors collected during surgical 
resections and liver transplants (normal liver samples) at the Mayo Clinic between 1997 and 
2013. Sections were examined by pathologist, graded histologically and classified by 
etiology. The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board.

 MRI and RANTES study
MRI was performed by operators blinded to study design using a Bruker 11.7T MRI system 
(Supplemental methods). After initial imaging, tumor-bearing mice were stratified into 2 
groups and injected IP with 400μg RANTES neutralizing antibody (MAB478, R&D 
systems, Minneapolis MN) or saline twice per week for 5 weeks, after which mice were re-
imaged and tumor volumes were recalculated.
Statistical analyses
These were performed using Student’s T-tests using Graphpad Prism 6 or Microsoft Excel. 
p<0.05 were considered significant with *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.

Results
SART1 deficiency is embryonic lethal at E11.5
HAF heterozygous mice (SART1+/−) were generated using C57BL/6 embryonic stem cells 
produced by the gene trap method (Fig. 1A-B). Tissue-wide profiling of male wild-type and 
SART1+/− mice confirmed expression of HAF in multiple organs including skin, lung, heart, 
liver, kidney, spleen and colon, with highest expression within the spleen (Fig. 1C). HAF 
heterozygosity was associated with significant decreases of HAF in heart, liver and kidney, 
and caused more subtle decreases in other tissues in which HAF could be detected (Fig. 1C-
D).
Out of a total of 99 pups resulting from pairings with heterozygous parents, 70 were het, 
whereas 29 were wild-type, close to the expected ratio of 2:1:1 for het: wild-type: knockout, 
consistent with embryonic lethality. By genotyping embryos at various developmental 
stages, knockouts were only identified at E11.5, and SART1−/− embryos showed diminished 
size and vascularization compared to their heterozygous or wild-type littermates (Fig. 1E). 
Thus, knockout of SART1 results in embryonic lethality at approximately E11.5.
SART1 haploinsufficiency promotes hepatic steatosis and HCC—Despite the 
embryonic lethality ofHAF knockout mice, mice heterozygous for HAF (SART1+/−) 
appeared to develop normally, and displayed no anatomically observable defects. However, 
at >14 months, male SART1+/ mice were significantly smaller, and had ruffled fur compared 
to their wild-type counterparts (Fig. 2A and Supplemental Data S1A). Necropsy revealed 
multifocal large liver tumors (histologically confirmed as HCC) in ~83% (5/6) of male 
SART1+/− mice, which were absent from their wild-type littermates (Fig. 2A), whereas both 
wild-type and SART1+/− male mice exhibited severe hepatic steatosis. The livers of the 
SART1+/− mice displayed hallmarks of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-driven HCC 
including hepatic steatosis (confirmed by Oil Red O staining), fibrosis (confirmed by Sirius 
Red staining) and foci of immune cell infiltration (Fig. 2B, Fig.4E-F). Visual analysis of 
additional male SART1+/− mice confirmed grossly visible tumors in an additional 90% 
(9/10) of mice. By contrast, the livers of age-matched SART1+/− females showed minimal 
steatosis, and no malignant tumors were detected either grossly or histologically (0/4, not

 shown). At age 10 months, HCC was detected in 42% (5/12) of mice, whereas pre-
neoplastic foci of hepatocellular alterations and/or adenomas were present in 83% (10/12) of 
mice. By contrast, none were observed in wild-type littermates (Fig. 2A). Consistent with 
enlarged livers and decreased overall body weight, the average liver weights/body weight 
ratios in SART1+/− mice were also significantly higher than their wild-type counterparts 
(Fig. 2C, RHS). Liver tumors were detected by MRI in a further 57% (4/7) of male SART1
+/− mice aged 16-18 months (S1B), but were not detected in male mice under the 10 months 
(0/21), nor in female SART1+/− mice aged 16-19 months (0/3). The rapid growth of the liver 
tumors was apparent when we monitored tumor growth in one 1616-18 month old mouse, 
where we found multiple large liver tumor nodules (S1C) confirmed histologically as HCC. 
No other obvious abnormalities were observed in the blood or any of the other major organs 
apart from age-related changes. Hence, germline haploinsufficiency of HAF promotes 
spontaneous HCC development only in male mice > age 10 months.
Hepatic steatosis precedes HCC formation in livers of SART1+/− mice
When examined histologically, livers of 1-month-old SART1+/− mice were indistinguishable 
from those of their wild-type littermates (Fig. 2D). However, at age 6 months, SART1+/− 
liverslivers showed moderate to marked microvesicular hepatic steatosis with increased 
severity in the centrilobular/periacinar and midzonal regions, and also showed multiple foci 
of altered hepatocytes with atypical nuclei (Fig. 2E, 3A). These foci were composed of 
hypertrophic or cytomegalic hepatocytes and showed increased proliferation supported by 
the increased number of mitotic and binucleated hepatocytes. Although these foci are 
considered pre-neoplastic lesions predisposing to tumor development, no neoplastic lesions 
were observed at this age. By contrast, livers of wild-type littermates showed only very mild 
steatosis, and no pre-neoplastic lesions. Consistent with the age-related progression to HCC, 
the elevation of the serum transaminases alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in the SART1 +/− mice versus wild 
type become apparent from 6 months of age (S1D). The age-associated liver phenotypes of 
the SART1+/− mice are summarized in Fig. 3B and S1E. Intriguingly, although HAF levels 
in SART1+/− versus wild-type livers were not significantly different at age 1 month, HAF 
levels decreased with increasing age, which reflected the development of liver pathology in 
the SART1 +/− mice (Fig. 3C-D). Hence, although initially normal, the livers of SART1+/− 
mice first manifest foci of pre-neoplastic hepatocellular alteration, coinciding with the 
development of hepatic steatosis, which then progress to HCC.
Microarray analysis of SART1+/− mouse livers indicate metabolic and immune 
dysfunction—To evaluate global changes in gene expression associated with HCC in the 
SART1 +/− mice, we performed microarray analysis comparing a SART1 +/−liver tumor (T) 
to an age-matched wild-type liver (N). Using a fold change cut-off of 2.0 fold up-or-down 
regulated, and p<0.05, 2290 genes were differentially expressed in T vs N groups out of 
20185 total genes probed by the array (Fig. 3E). Intriguingly, the top differentially expressed 
gene was alpha fetoprotein (Afp, 441 fold induction versus normal), which encodes a blood 
serum marker typically used for diagnosis of HCC in humans (S2A). Using Ingenuity 
Pathway Analysis (IPA), the top biological functions associated with these differentially 
expressed genes were those involved in the inflammatory response, cancer, and lipid

 metabolism (S2B). We also observed highly significant changes in genes associated with 
hepatocyte hyperplasia/proliferation, steatosis and HCC. All these expression changes were 
consistent with the observed steatosis/steatohepatitis/HCC phenotype in the SART1+/− 
livers.
SART1 +/− hepatocytes have defective fatty acid oxidation—To investigate the 
molecular pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis in the SART1+/− mice, we examined the 
expression of subsets of genes known to be involved in the various aspects of lipid 
metabolism. According to IPA, 39 out of 45 genes involved in fatty acid metabolism were 
significantly decreased (p=6.86E-13; Fig. 3E, S3A). This included Acyl-CoA synthase long-
chain family member 1 (Acsl1), which catalyzes one of the first steps of fatty acid oxidation; 
and a large number of cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes, which have diverse roles in liver 
metabolism (13). By contrast, levels of the major transcription factors that promote 
lipogenesis and lipid uptake, sterol regulatory element–binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c, 
SREBF1), carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP, MLXIPL), and 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ, PPARG), were not significantly 
altered in our dataset, nor were their downstream gene expression profiles significantly 
altered. The trend of decreased expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation was 
validated using 3 additional SART1+/− livers normalized to livers from 3 wild-type 
littermates, and was also confirmed at the protein level for Acsl1 and CYP2b10 (Fig. 3F).
To determine whether fatty acid oxidation was indeed dysfunctional in the SART1+/− mice, 
hepatocytes from 4 month old SART1+/− mice and their wild-type littermates were subjected 
to metabolic analysis using the Seahorse XF Extracellular Flux analyzer. Using oxygen 
consumption rate, OCR, as an indicator of mitochondrial respiration, we found that 
SART1+/− hepatocytes showed a lower basal level of respiration compared to wild-type (Fig. 
4A). When treated with the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP, which induces maximal 
respiration, SART1+/− hepatocytes showed an almost 4-fold decrease in the ability to utilize 
exogenous palmitate compared to wild-type hepatocytes (Fig. 4A-B). Similar results were 
obtained using Huh7 human hepatoma cells transiently transfected with control or HAF 
(SART1) siRNA (Fig. 4C-D). Thus, the enhanced hepatic steatosis observed in the 
SART1 +/− livers is likely due to defective fatty acid oxidation. .
SART1+/− mice show marked upregulation of HIF-1α in immune cells—In 
addition to metabolic dysfunction, SART1 +/− livers showed changes consistent with 
increased inflammatory cell activation and trafficking (Fig. 3E, S2B). Indeed, SART1+/− 
livers showed extensive immune cell infiltration, distributed randomly and sporadically, 
often in clusters, throughout the liver parenchyma (Fig. 4E). These included cells positive 
for F4/80 or Ly6G suggesting that these clusters contained macrophages and neutrophils 
respectively (Fig. 4F). Additionally, Kupffer cell hyperplasia (likely a result of phagocytosis 
of disrupted hepatocytes) was observed in 100% (6/6) of the SART1+/− livers but not in 
wild-type livers (S1E). Significantly, the liver-infiltrating immune cells were markedly 
HIF-1α positive in SART1+/− but not in wild-type livers (arrows, Fig. 4G). Increases in 
HIF-1α was manifest primarily in SART1+/− immune cells, but not in SART1+/− 
hepatocytes, suggesting that the HIF-1α upregulation was not due to a general hypoxic

 environment within the livers (Fig. 4G, S4A-B). The changes observed in SART1+/− 
immune cells may also reflect the distribution of HAF expression, which was detected 
primarily in infiltrating immune cells in wild-type livers (S4C). By contrast, HIF-2α was 
expressed in the immune infiltrating cells in the livers of both wild-type and SART1+/− mice 
(S4C).
To establish whether HIF-1α upregulation played a causal role in HCC carcinogenesis in the 
SART+/− mice, or occurred as a result of the HCC already present, we isolated mononuclear 
cells from peripheral blood (PBMCs) and spleens of 6 month old SART1+/− and wild-type 
mice. HIF-1α protein levels were significantly elevated in both PBMCs and splenocytes 
from SART1+/− versus wild type mice, but not in primary hepatocytes (Fig. 5A, S4B). We 
also noted that unlike the PBMCs, splenocytes did not express detectable HIF-1α unless 
exposed to hypoxia (only cells exposed to hypoxia are depicted), suggesting some intrinsic 
differences in HIF-1α expression in these cell types. These findings were associated with a 
reduction in HAF protein levels expected of the SART1+/− genotype (S4D). By contrast, we 
did not detect upregulation of HIF-1α in PBMCs or splenocytes isolated from 6 month old 
female SART1+/− mice, and only detected subtle decreases in HAF levels (S5A-B). Hence, 
the data suggest that HIF-1α upregulation in immune cells was intrinsic to the male 
SART1+/− mice, and occurred independently of HCC.
To determine whether HAF expression in immune cells was cell type-specific, we measured 
the activity of the LacZ reporter transgene used to disrupt the SART1 gene. We detected 
LacZ positivity in a wide variety of cell populations including spleen- and bone marrow-
derived cells, and peripheral blood leukocytes (Fig 5B, S6A). To identify cell types that 
expressed LacZ (and therefore endogenous HAF), we stained splenocytes with surface 
markers: CD19 (B-Cells), TCRβ (T-Cells), Ly6G (neutrophils), F4/80 (macrophages) prior 
to the Lac Z activity assay. Here, we observed significant LacZ/FITC positivity in all cell 
types, with highest expression in B and T-cells, and macrophages, whereas no significant 
differences between the immune cell populations from SART1+/− and wild-type mice were 
observed (Fig. 5C, S6B-C). Thus, HAF is highly expressed in all immune cells, and loss of 
HAF in the male SART1+/− mice is associated with HIF-1α upregulation in all immune cell 
types.
HCC is preceded by increased RANTES secretion and elevated neutrophilic 
infiltration—To determine whether immune cells played a causal role in the development 
of HCC, we isolated Kupffer cells (KCs) from the livers of 5-month-old SART1+/− mice, 
and compared their secreted cytokine expression profiles to that of wild-type littermates. In 
general, SART1+/− KCs had higher levels of secreted cytokines than wild-type KCs (Fig. 
5D, S3B). Intriguingly, levels of the chemokine Regulated on Activation, Normal T cell 
Expressed (RANTES) was increased by >100 fold in the SART1+/− KCs compared to wild-
type KCs (Fig. 5D). RANTES plays a major role in recruiting leukocytes to sites of injury, 
and is transcriptionally regulated by HIF-1α by multiple functional HREs within its 
promoter (14, 15). Knockdown of HAF using siRNA in THP-1 cells also resulted in 
significant upregulation of RANTES in both normoxia and hypoxia (Fig. 5E). RANTES was 
significantly upregulated in the livers of SART1+/− mice over wild-type mice from 6 months 
of age, although increased transcription was already detected at 1 month of age (Fig. 6A).

 Consistent with HIF-1α upregulation, we also detected an age-dependent albeit delayed 
increase (compared to RANTES) in the transcription of HIF-1 target genes facilitated 
glucose transporter 1 (Slc2a1), Hexokinase 1 (Hk1) and pyruvate kinase (muscle) 1 (Pkm1) 
in the SART1+/− livers indicating a general shift towards glycolytic metabolism (Fig. 6B). 
By contrast, we did not observe any differences in secretion of RANTES or other cytokines 
by KCs from similar-aged female SART1+/− livers compared to wild-type (S5C).
To determine whether the immune cell sub-populations present within the SART1+/− livers 
were altered prior to HCC initiation, we profiled the livers of 66 month old mice. 
Intriguingly, we found a 6-fold increase in Ly6G+ neutrophils in SART1+/− livers relative to 
wild-type, also observed via immunohistochemistry, whereas levels of CD11c+ 
macrophages, CD4, CD8, gamma delta and NK T cells were not significantly altered (Fig. 
6C-D). We also observed a 3-fold increase in Ly6G+ neutrophils within livers of 1 month 
old SART1+/− mice which was not observed in the spleens, suggesting that increased 
neutrophilic infiltration was an early event independent of hepatic steatosis, and was not due 
to systemic elevation of the neutrophil population (Fig. 6E-F, S7). Thus, male but not female 
SART1+/− KCs secrete elevated levels of cytokines/chemokines including a >100-fold 
increase in RANTES. This was associated with increased neutrophilic infiltration in male 
SART1+/− livers prior to the development of steatosis or HCC.
RANTES neutralization inhibits HCC initiation/growth and decreases 
neutrophil infiltration—To determine the impact of RANTES secretion on liver 
neutrophilic infiltration, and HCC initiation/progression, we used a neutralizing antibody to 
RANTES and monitored treatment efficacy by MRI. Imaging of SART1+/− mice aged 14-18 
months revealed only 4 of 15 mice bore tumors with a total volume of >100mm3 clearly 
detectable by MRI (Fig. 7A, S8). The mice were treated with RANTES neutralizing 
antibody (or saline) for 5 weeks and were re-imaged. Upon re-imaging, we observed the 
appearance of new nodules in the control group but not in the RANTES-treated group, 
suggesting that RANTES treatment prevented liver tumor initiation/promotion (Fig. 7A-C, 
S8). The growth of individual nodules was also markedly reduced in the RANTES-treated 
mice (RANTES 6.709 ± 3.872 fold, n=5, versus control 13.20 ± 6.546 fold, n=5; Fig. 7D-E). 
We also observed a significant decrease in Ly6G+ infiltrating neutrophils in both tumor and 
adjacent normal tissue of mice treated with RANTES compared to those treated with saline 
alone (Fig. 7F-G). Hence RANTES neutralization inhibits both the initiation/promotion and 
growth of liver tumors, and attenuates neutrophilic infiltration in the livers of SART1+/− 
mice.
Human HCC show upregulation of HIF-1α/RANTES and HAF downregulation—
Similar to the SART1+/− livers (Fig. 4G), HIF-1α positive immune infiltrating cells in the 
context of largely HIF-1α negative hepatocytes was also observed in human HCC including 
NASH-derived HCC (Fig. 8A-B). RANTES expression in both hepatocytes and immune 
infiltrating cells was also upregulated in NASH-derived HCC compared to normal liver (Fig. 
8C). By contrast, HAF staining was detected primarily in infiltrating cells in normal human 
liver but was largely negative in human NASH-derived HCC (Fig. 8A, D), thus supporting a 
role for HAF as a tumor suppressor for HCC.

 Discussion
HCC is the most common primary malignancy of the liver, with more than 750,000 new 
patients diagnosed globally each year (16). HCC frequently develops in the context of 
chronic hepatitis, which may arise from infection with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or Hepatitis 
C virus (HCV), and from alcoholic or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD/NAFLD) 
(17). The current obesity epidemic has been associated with an increasing prevalence of 
NAFLD and its inflammatory component non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which leads 
to HCC. The complex interplay between damaged hepatocytes and immune infiltrating cells 
within an inflammatory hepatic microenvironment is believed to drive HCC initiation and 
progression (18, 19). Hence, HCC pathogenesis has been described by the “two hit” 
hypothesis whereby the first “hit”-steatosis/viral infection - sensitizes the liver to a variety of 
second “hits”, such as oxidative stress and abnormal cytokine production, which lead to 
necroinflammation and fibrosis (20, 21).
Here, we show that germline haploinsufficiency of SART1 induces HCC in the context of 
NASH only in male mice. This is to our knowledge, the only genetic model where 
haploinsufficency promotes HCC without requiring any further manipulation. The livers of 
the SART1+/− mice showed decreased fatty acid oxidation, providing a likely mechanism for 
the hepatic steatosis (or first ‘hit’), and also showed constitutive stabilization of HIF-1α 
specifically in immune cells, elevated cytokine secretion by KCs, and increased neutrophilic 
infiltration prior to HCC development (together constituting the second ‘hit’). The activation 
of these immune cells likely promotes oxidative damage and inflammation, driving 
progression to HCC. Although infiltrating immune cells are known to be involved in HCC 
initiation and progression, the plethora of inflammatory cytokines upregulated in human 
HCC have confounded the identification of individual key cytokines to target for therapy 
(22-25). The robust timeline for HCC development in the male SART1+/− mice enabled the 
identification of RANTES as an early, non-redundant event driving HCC initiation and 
progression, likely by promoting neutrophil infiltration. Intriguingly, increased circulating 
RANTES has been associated with obesity in humans, and is upregulated in patients with 
NAFLD/NASH, suggesting that RANTES might be involved in the progression to NASH-
driven HCC (26, 27). The evaluation of the relevance of HIF-1/RANTES to NASH-driven 
HCC is currently being investigated in a larger patient set. Intriguingly, RANTES elevation 
has also been observed in patients with alcoholic and viral hepatitis, whereas RANTES 
polymorphisms correlate to susceptibility to HCC suggesting that RANTES may be a valid 
therapeutic target for HCC regardless of etiology (28, 29).
An intriguing observation in our studies was that HCC did not occur in female SART1+/− 
mice. This male predominance also occurs in human HCC, and in chemically-induced HCC 
in mice (with the hepatic procarcinogen N-nitrosodiethylamine, DEN) (30, 31). The male 
bias for DEN-induced HCC has been attributed to the suppressive effect of estrogen on IL-6 
production, aa driving factor for DEN-induced HCC (30). Whether the male bias observed in 
our model is related to IL-6 production is unclear, but it does appear to be associated with an 
intrinsic resistance of both wild-type and SART1+/− female mice to hepatic steatosis, an 
initiating factor for HCC in the male SART1+/− mice. Female SART1+/− and wild-type mice 
even at >16 months of age develop only mild hepatic steatosis, if at all, and do not become

 obese like their male counterparts (our unpublished observations). The age-dependent 
decrease in HAF levels in male SART1+/− mice, which was accompanied by immune cell 
specific upregulation of HIF-1α, was not observed in female mice suggesting that the 
predisposition to steatosis in males may drive further decreases in HAF, hence exacerbating 
the development of liver pathology (Fig 3C, 5A, S5). Additional factors driving the male 
bias may be the sex-dependent production of RANTES (Fig 5D, S5C), which has been 
previously reported in obese mice (26). Nevertheless, steatosis per se is insufficient to induce 
HCC as germline VHL+/− mice, or mice bearing hepatocyte-specific VHL deletion, develop 
severe hepatic steatosis but not HCC (32, 33). Since VHL is unable to degrade HIF-1α under 
hypoxic conditions, it is possible that HAF, as an oxygen-independent ubiquitin ligase, may 
play a more central role in attenuating inappropriate HIF-1α upregulation under hypoxic, 
inflammatory conditions. Indeed, the high expression levels of endogenous HAF within the 
mouse spleen and in immune infiltrating cells (Fig. 1C, 8A, D) supports an immune-specific 
physiological role of HAF as a suppressor of HIF-1α.
In view of the systemic activation of immune mediators in male SART1+/− mice, we also 
observed increased lymphohistiocytic infiltration in the lungs, gastro-intestinal tract, and 
lymph nodes of SART1+/− mice compared to wild-type (our unpublished observations). 
Hence, it is likely that other organ-specific stresses may lead to inflammation-induced 
cancer in these organs, and this is currently under investigation. In addition to its role as a 
ubiquitin ligase for HIF-1α, HAF has also been known to play a role in pre-mRNA splicing 
(11), and to inhibit Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication in hepatoma cells via changes in 
splicing (34). Hence, splicing changes in the SART1+/− mouse are also currently being 
explored.
In conclusion, this study identifies a novel tumor suppressor function of HAF by 
maintaining regular hepatic metabolism, and in preventing inappropriate immune cell 
activation, possibly by suppressing HIF-1α. Additionally, we described a novel mouse 
model of NASH-derived HCC, which closely recapitulates the human disease. Our findings 
highlight a central role of the HIF-1/RANTES axis in HCC initiation and progression, thus 
identifying a novel target for therapy.
