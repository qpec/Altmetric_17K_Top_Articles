ABSTRACT 
BACKGROUND 
Progress in science and technology have created the capabilities and alternatives to symptom-driven 
medical care.  Reducing premature mortality associated with age-related chronic diseases, such as cancer 
and cardiovascular disease, is an urgent priority we address using advanced screening detection. 
METHODS 
We enrolled active adults for early detection of risk for age-related chronic disease associated with 
premature mortality. Whole genome sequencing together with:  global metabolomics, 3D/4D imaging 
using non-contrast whole body magnetic resonance imaging and echocardiography, and 2-week cardiac 
monitoring were employed to detect age-related chronic diseases and risk for diseases. 
RESULTS 
We detected previously unrecognized age-related chronic diseases requiring prompt (<30 days) medical 
attention in 17 (8%, 1:12) of 209 study participants, including 4 participants with early stage neoplasms 
(2%, 1:50).  Likely mechanistic genomic findings correlating with clinical data were identified in 52 
participants (25%. 1:4).  More than three-quarters of participants (n=164, 78%, 3:4) had evidence of age-
related chronic diseases or associated risk factors.  
CONCLUSIONS 
Precision medicine screening using genomics with other advanced clinical data among active adults 
identified unsuspected disease risks for age-related chronic diseases associated with premature mortality.  
This technology-driven phenotype screening approach has the potential to extend healthy life among 
active adults through improved early detection and prevention of age-related chronic diseases.  Our 
success provides a scalable strategy to move medical practice and discovery toward risk detection and 
disease modification thus achieving healthier extension of life.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT 
Advances in science and technology have enabled scientists to analyze the human genome cost-
effectively and to combine genome sequencing with noninvasive imaging technologies for alternatives to 
symptom-driven medical care. Using whole genome sequencing and noninvasive 3D/4D imaging 
technologies we screened 209 adults to detect age-related chronic diseases, such as cancer and 
cardiovascular disease. We found unrecognized age-related chronic diseases requiring prompt (<30 days) 
medical attention in 1:12 study participants, likely genomic findings correlating with clinical data in 1:4 
participants, and evidence of age-related chronic diseases or associated risk factors in more than 3 of 4 
participants. These results demonstrate that genome sequencing with clinical imaging data can be used for 
screening and early detection of diseases associated with premature mortality.

INTRODUCTION 
The near-doubling of average human life expectancy over the last 150 years is a tribute to scientific 
advancements in medicine and public health (1).  In large part this success is the result of progress in 
control and prevention of infectious diseases particularly among young children.  Eight-five percent of 
children born now in the US can expect to live to 65 years of age; and 42% will likely celebrate an 85
th 
birthday (1).  As a result of this success the USA is facing a daunting and costly new medical challenge in 
the prevention (intervention) of age-related chronic diseases (1, 2). 
 
Most age-related chronic diseases have heritability(3, 4), often are slowly progressive with symptom-free 
onset (5),  and are associated with common risk factors (2, 6).  In 2015, the estimated US cumulative 
mortality risk among males 50 to 74 years of age was 39%; for women, the risk was lower but still 
substantial at 24% (7).  The causes of these deaths are similar across genders with neoplasms and 
cardiovascular disease accounting for about one-third each.  Diabetes and related conditions, respiratory, 
cirrhosis and other liver diseases, and neurologic disorders account for the remaining one-third. 
 
Few published examples demonstrate how genomics (8, 9) might be proactively incorporated into new 
models for medical practice, and what infrastructure will be needed to support data generation and use 
(10-15).  We employed noninvasive advanced phenotyping approaches to detect risk of disease prior to 
damaging medical events. We used pedigree information, clinical grade whole genome sequencing (9); 
global metabolomics (12, 16); 3D/4D imaging focusing on non-contrast whole-body magnetic resonance 
imaging (17-19); cardiac imaging; 2-week cardiac rhythm monitoring; and standard laboratory studies. 
Our objective for active adults was similar to successful newborn screening using advanced mass 
spectroscopy technologies for early simultaneous detection of multiple life-threatening conditions (20, 
21).  Age-related chronic diseases associated with premature mortality are much more common among 
active adults than diseases targeted in newborn screening which make them good candidates for

screening, but requiring a broader set of specialized tools and technologies for identification of disease 
risk than a single modality such as DNA sequencing.  Phenotype data enhances risk detection and 
clarifies ambiguous sequence information in N of 1 evaluations. 
 
RESULTS 
We enrolled 209 study participants, median age 55 yrs, range 20-98 yrs, 34.5% female, between 
September 10, 2015 and May 16, 2016.  Twenty-one (10%) of the 209 participants were from 7 families. 
Selected characteristics comparing study participants to age and gender-adjusted NHANES cohort, a US 
population-based sample, is shown in Table 1.  Routine clinical laboratory testing was obtained on 90 
study participants (43%); Quantose IR (including fasting blood glucose) was obtained on 208 participants 
and included fasting blood glucose.  Magnetic resonance imaging-based quantitative body compartment-
specific fat and muscle estimation was conducted on 126 participants (60%).  Some portion of the 
intended 2-week cardiac rhythm monitoring was completed on 140 (67%) participants; the median 
duration of monitoring was 5.9 days (range 0.8-14 days) (Figure 1). 
 
We identified seventeen study participants (8%) with evidence of age- related chronic diseases considered 
significant and highly actionable requiring prompt medical attention following confirmation of screening 
findings:  four early stage neoplasias (thymoma, renal cell carcinoma, and two high grade prostate 
neoplasms), one enlarged aortic root, two newly recognized atrial fibrillation cases, two medically 
significant arrhythmias, one 3rd degree heart block, one primary biliary cholangitis, and one xanthinuria 
(Table 2). Some individuals had no detectable genetic risk emphasizing the value of phenotyping 
technology. 
 
Table 3 lists the pathogenic associations of genomic variants. 52 (25%, 1:4) participants had likely 
mechanistic genotype-phenotype associations (Figure 2).  Of the 52 variants there were 34 unique genes,

38 unique variants, zygosity was 50 heterozygous and 2 homozygous, with 3 new variant-disease 
associations observed in 2 different families. 
 
We identified 164 (78%, >3:4) participants with evidence of age-related chronic disease or risk factors.  
One-hundred-and-eighteen study participants (56%) had evidence of diabetes or risk for diabetes:  15 
(7%) had type 2 diabetes; 80 (38%) had pre-diabetes (38%), and 23 (11%) had insulin resistance (based 
on Quantose IR). Only 19 (16%) reported a history of type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes (Table 2).  One- 
hundred-and-twenty-four participants (59%) had evidence of atherosclerotic disease or risk.  Thirty-three 
(16%) had evidence of metabolic syndrome.  Twenty-eight participants (13%) met a screening definition 
for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and one had suspected non-alcoholic steatohepatitis 
(NASH).  Many participants had multiple over-lapping conditions including:  29 with pre-diabetes and 
atherosclerotic disease or risk; 19 with pre-diabetes, atherosclerotic disease or risk, and metabolic 
syndrome and; 13 with insulin resistance and atherosclerotic disease or risk (Figure 1). 
 
We identified 10 unique alleles in 14 subjects with metabolic signatures consistent with penetrance.  
Metabolic pathways impacted by the allelic differences included fatty acid beta oxidation, fatty acid 
synthesis, urea cycle, and signatures associated with oxidative stress.  Strong metabolic signatures were 
observed for two polymorphisms matching the genes’ function.  Two heterozygous ACADS variants, 
c.1510G>A and c.1030C>T, coding for the short-chain acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase (SCAD) were 
detected in one case.  In another case, the heterozygous ACADM variant c.1456C>T coding for medium-
chain acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) was detected and interestingly both enzymes participate 
in fatty acid beta-oxidation by reducing different fatty acid chain length (22). SCAD specifically acts on 
the short chain fatty acid butyryl-CoA and MCAD reduces acyl-CoA chains containing 6-12 carbons.  In 
the absence of SCAD activity, byproducts of butyryl-CoA including butyrycarnitine and ethylmalonate 
accumulate (23).  Greatly elevated levels of butyrylcarnitine and ethylmalonate (Z-scores above 97.5

percentile) were observed in the plasma suggestive of combined metabolic penetrance of these variants.  
Moreover, greatly elevated medium chain acyl-carnitines, hexanoylcarnitine, octanoylcarnitine and 
decanoylcarnitine (Z-scores above 97.5 the percentile) were detected suggestive of reduced MCAD 
activity.  Large genome-wide association studies combined with metabolic profiling have previously 
identified associations between ACADS and MCAD and their respective metabolic substrates lending 
support to the metabolic penetrance observed on an individual basis in this study (24-26).  We previously 
reported on additional metabolomic/genetic variants which are heterozygotes for known recessively 
inherited disorders(12, 16).  These studies established that "carrier" disease state does not reflect carrier 
for individual metabolic variation.  The number of adult cases of metabolic penetrance will continue to 
expanded using this approach. 
 
Metabolomics analysis also detected xanthinuria in an individual with early onset (20’s) recurrent renal 
stones (6 episodes) as well as the drug effect of xanthine oxidase inhibitors in 3 other individuals.  
Although hypoxanthine and especially xanthine levels were elevated in both cases, normal urate and 
elevated orotate and orotidine levels, due to perturbed pyrimidine synthesis (27), were only observed in 
individuals taking xanthine oxidase inhibitors (allopurinols) for their gout conditions. 
 
DISCUSSION 
We used a precision medicine screening approach integrating whole genome sequencing and phenotype 
assessments for disease risk detection among active adults focusing on age-related chronic diseases 
associated with premature mortality.  We found a substantial burden of largely unrecognized disease risk 
among study participants using three different analytic perspectives including those: 1) with significant 
and highly actionable conditions requiring prompt medical attention for previously unrecognized 
potentially life-threatening age-related chronic diseases (8%); 2) with likely mechanistic genomic 
findings correlated with other clinical associations (25%) and; 3) with evidence of age-related chronic

disease or risk factors (78%).  In design of our study we hypothesized that by proactively combining 
clinical grade deep whole genome sequencing(9), and advanced clinical testing including global 
metabolomics, as well as 3D/4D imaging, emphasizing use of radiation-free low-to-no risk technologies 
like non-contrast MRI and echocardiography, 2-week cardiac monitoring, as well as routine laboratory 
testing, we could identify more precise disease risks allowing for earlier intervention and better health 
outcomes.  False positives and other negative aspects of screening were mitigated by the high prevalence 
and life-threatening nature of targeted conditions, use of low-to-no-risk technologies, and convergent 
approaches for interpretation of results.  Our data supports clinical utility of the approach presently and 
sets a challenge for the future improvements, including decreasing costs, through use of supporting 
technologies and infrastructure. 
 
There is warranted concern about testing performance whenever screening is undertaken in medical 
practice. False positives may expose people to unnecessary risks, anxiety, costs, and inconvenience (28).  
The traditional medical approach to minimizing false positives is to rely on occurrence of symptoms to 
increase pre-test probabilities, though this is poorly understood by most physicians (29).  Whole genome 
sequence data is a particular concern with the high number of VUS variants due to lack of N of 1 
phenotype correlations.  Traditional medical evaluations are clearly an inadequate approach for early 
recognition of age-related chronic diseases, many of which are preventable, and the fact that the later 
manifestations of these diseases now represent most of the current total US Medicare expenditure (2, 30).  
For nationally-sanctioned proactive single-disease adult screening programs, there are robust long-term 
evaluations examining testing performance in the context of clinical harms and benefits, and costs – at the 
population level, even though it is now increasingly well recognized that individual risk varies widely for 
these conditions (31).  Both of these time-honored approaches have advanced health but are insufficient to 
cope with introduction of genomics and other new science and technologies (e.g., imaging and 
metabolomics) to medicine, particularly when combined with the dramatic demographic and 
epidemiologic changes underway in the US and globally.  A major promise of genomics and precision

medicine is to more tightly link curative (to identify pathology) and preventive (to identify risk) medical 
disciplines by creating new health and health care platforms to personalize disease risk and longitudinal 
care.  Our data suggest a route to creating such an approach, initially focusing on prevention of premature 
deaths among active adults associated with age-related chronic diseases, then expanding to other causes 
of disability (e.g., disability-adjust life year, or DALY) and additional life stages. 
 
Genomics as currently applied has been disappointing in its ability to unravel the “missing heritability” of 
most age-related chronic diseases, and other common diseases (32, 33).  This shortcoming is slowly 
improving as a result of public and private efforts to expand sequencing but still leaves a plethora of VUS 
to assess.  All are dependent on heterogenous contributions to the public databases, not N of 1 studies.  
First, we expect and are increasingly finding and seeing supporting evidence for the increasing 
recognition of rare variants with large effect sizes (3, 9, 34).  Combining this with advancements in 
monogenic and polygenic methodologies to assess causation including Mendelian randomization methods 
(35), extension of genome-wide association study to create hazard models (36), and continued exploration 
of pleiotropy (37), will increase clinical utility.  Second, increasingly detailed mapping of molecular 
pathways and mechanisms associated with diseases and risk factors will provide a much needed improved 
capability to link genotype and phenotype data (12, 16, 38).  In our study, we were able to demonstrate 
the use of global metabolomics in mapping to genomic defects.  This integration will strengthen with 
additional automation of analysis.  Thirdly, we are working to quantitatively integrate genomics with 
other clinical data, particularly advanced imaging data, to create point-of-care clinical decision support 
(37, 39, 40).  The version of HLI Search
TM we are using can query more than 40,000 genomes 
(individuals and families) and explore genotype-phenotype associations with millisecond response times.  
We are expanding this capability using the full range of genome- and phenotype-derived data signals to 
rapidly identify, classify, and prioritize individual opportunities for tertiary (disease treatment), secondary 
(risk factor control), and primary prevention using human- and machine-driven feature extraction.  Such

will enable the practicing physician to incorporate precisions medicine toward disease prevention.  The 
potential value of evolving medical practice from disease diagnosis to risk detection is supported by our 
study.  A larger cohort and longer follow-up will strengthen these initial 209 case findings.  The relatively 
high burden of risk identified may be partially due to self-selection of clients with health concerns.  This 
is supported by comparison of our study participants to NHANES data (Table 2), and has been suggested 
by earlier authors in similar studies (11).  We recommended follow-up imaging studies for slightly more 
than one-third of our study participants.  Some of this is the nature of screening, which drives need for 
more definitive imaging studies better suited to specific abnormalities.  Other instances of referral were 
intended to identify change over a specified time period which might be suggestive of cancer such as 
finding a cystic pancreatic lesion (41) or instability of a vascular lesion such an intracranial aneurysm 
(42).  In some instances, data is lacking to confidently predict the natural course of these findings, and as 
a result may cause unnecessary anxiety and unneeded surgery (41, 42).  However, the life-threatening 
consequences and relatively high prevalence of diseases associated with these lesions suggests that early 
recognition is likely to be beneficial for most individuals.  Some of the technology used in this study has 
the potential to measure progression or resolution of the risk thus enhancing disease intervention.  
Expansion of some or all of our approach reported here to broader populations will require attention to 
cost, utility, physician and consumer acceptance.  We continue to explore additional innovative 
noninvasive phenotyping technologies in the search for N of 1 precision medicine. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
We enrolled active adults >18 years old (without acute illness, activity-limiting unexplained illness or 
symptoms, or known active cancer) able to come for 6-8 hours of on-site data collection, were able to 
undergo magnetic resonance imaging without sedation, in the case of women were not pregnant or 
attempting to become pregnant, and were interested in undergoing a novel precision medicine screening

encouraged to involve their primary care physicians. 
 
Participants underwent a verbal review of the institutional review board-approved consent (Western 
Institutional Review Board) and were given time to ask and receive answers to questions during a one- 
half to one-hour sessions conducted by health professionals. Study participants underwent standardized 
activities related to data collection and return of results in pre-visit, visit, and post-visit phases during a 1-
year study period. 
 
Selected data were collected regarding past medical and family history, risk factors, and medical 
symptoms prior to or during study participant visit (43). Participants were instructed to stop taking 
supplements for 72 hours, and to fast after dinner the night before their morning appointment.  On the day 
of visit, blood was obtained for whole genome sequencing (Human Longevity, Inc.)(9), global 
metabolomics (12) and QUANTOSETM IR (44) (Metabolon), and routine clinical laboratory tests 
(LabCorp Inc.
TM). 
 Two-week cardiac rhythm monitoring (Zio XT Patch
TM, iRhythm Technologies, Inc.
TM) kits were 
provided with instructions for use, or monitoring was initiated during visit. Height, weight, and sitting 
blood pressure (45) were obtained. 
 
Genomic variants were annotated using integrated public and proprietary annotation sources in the HLI 
Knowledgebase
TM including ClinVar(46), and HGMD
TM (Qiagen).  Monogenic rare variants were 
classified as pathogenic (P), likely pathogenic (LP), or variant of uncertain significance (VUS).  The HLI 
Knowledgebase
TM integrates allele frequencies for variants derived from HLI’s database of >12,000 
sequences and provides a platform for query of these variants with annotation data.

0.27) of HLI Search
TM in a two-step process: the first step focused on allele frequency <1% in the HLI 
cohort with annotation using ClinVar and HGMD as well as predicted loss of function variants; the 
second step focused on participant-specific phenotype-driven queries using an allele frequency of <1% 
based on family and individual medical history as well as abnormal clinical testing results. 
 
Global metabolic profiling was performed using ultrahigh performance liquid-phase chromatography 
separation coupled with tandem mass spectrometry to assess the metabolic penetrance of the variants in 
these subject (44).  Z-scores were calculated for all metabolites in each subject against a reference cohort 
consisting of 42 fasted subjects of normal health, and metabolites with Z-scores below the 2.5th or above 
the 97.5th percentiles of the reference cohort were considered to be potentially indicative of metabolic 
abnormalities that warranted further investigation. Integration of metabolomic and gene sequence data 
was achieved by a proprietary pathway analysis program developed by Metabolon and HLI. 
 
Study participants underwent whole body magnetic resonance imaging (GE Discovery MR750w 3.0T
TM) 
in research mode (courtesy GE
TM) using protocols and post-processing for volumetric brain imaging 
(Neuroquant
TM, CorTechs Laboratories
TM), cancer detection (using restriction spectrum imaging), 
neurovascular and cardiovascular visualization, liver-specific fat and iron estimation, and quantitative 
body compartment-specific fat and muscle estimation (AMRA
TM)(19); other post-processing was done by 
MMIS
TM (co-author, Anders Dale).  GE Lunar iDXA with Pro Package was used for skeletal and 
metabolic health assessment.  Magnetic resonance imaging and iDXA images were interpreted by co- 
author, DK.  GE Vivid E95 was used for echocardiography and a GE Mac 2000 was used to obtain a 12- 
lead resting electrocardiogram. 2-week cardiac monitoring, electrocardiogram, and echocardiography 
were interpreted by co-author, AK.

Participants with likely mechanistic genomic findings correlating with clinical data were identified by 
expert review to identify convergent genomic and clinical (or phenotype) data relationships including at 
least two clinical (or phenotype) data elements supporting a genomic observation, including three 
generation family history and metabolite level correlation based on pathway mapping. 
 
Baseline characteristics including reported past medical history for major categories of age-related 
chronic diseases by study participants were compared to responses from NHANES, a US population- 
based cohort (Table 1), adjusted for age and sex distributions.  Study participants with evidence of age- 
related chronic diseases considered significant and highly actionable were defined as new genomic 
and/or other clinical findings which based on current medical practice indicated the need for medical 
attention to avoid potentially life-threatening consequences immediately or within 30 days from their 
visit.  Participants with evidence of age-related chronic disease or disease risk factors were identified as 
including: 1) type 2 diabetes (47), pre-diabetes (47) and insulin resistance (Quantose IR)(43); 2) likely 
atherosclerotic disease or risk; 3) metabolic syndrome (48); 4) non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis, based on clinical guidelines or other recent literature.  Measured fasting blood 
glucose, hemoglobin A1C, personal medical history for diabetes, or Quantose IR was used to identify 
participants as having diabetes, pre-diabetes or insulin resistance.  The presence of any of the following 
were considered to be evidence of likely atherosclerotic disease or risk: “yes” in response to any of the 
following questions:  1) Ever told you had coronary artery disease, 2) Ever told you had a heart attack, 3) 
Ever told you had congestive heart failure, 4) Taking prescription for hypertension, and 5) Taking 
prescription for cholesterol, or if sitting blood pressure > normal, LDL cholesterol > normal, or 
Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) > normal.  The presence of any three of the 
following 5 criteria were considered to be evidence of metabolic syndrome:  1) visceral adipose tissue 
measured by MRI (post-processing by AMRA
TM) > 2SD above normal (19), or android/gynoid fat

blood pressure ≥130/85 mmHg or the participant is currently taking prescription for hypertension; 5) 
Measured fasting glucose or hemoglobin A1c indicates pre-diabetes(48) or “borderline” in response to the 
question - Doctor told you have diabetes.  The presence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis were considered likely if: for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease MRI-based 
estimate liver fat was <4% and did not have alcohol dependence, and for these individuals we used a 
formula including other demographic and laboratory data to identify likely non-alcoholic steatohepatitis 
(49).

Finding: Head: Non-contrast brain MRA. 50% loss of signal of the left internal 
carotid artery at the juntion of the cavernous and petrous portions may 
represent artifact versus partial narrowing. Recommend CT angiogram of the 
brain for further evaluation. 
Chest: 4 x 2 cm lesion in the medial right lower lobe. Suggestion of connection 
to the pulmonary vessels. Recommend CT chest to rule out pulmonary AVM. 
Other considerations include mass, sarcoid, sequestration or atelectasis. 
Followup: Pending

M 
 
 
 
63 
Medical History: Melanoma 
Finding:  A 3 cm lobulated contour of the left kidney may represent a benign 
dromedary hump. However there is limited evaluation. Recommend renal 
ultrasound to rule out a mass. 
Followup: Surgically resected and found to be high grade early stage renal cell 
carcinoma. 
 
 
Neoplasm 
 
 
M 
 
 
56 
Finding: 5 cm anterior mediastinal mass with differential including lymphoma, 
thymoma or germ cell tumor. The mass is most likely a thymoma, likely stage 
1 or 2. There is no obvious vascular invasion and no lymph nodes. 
Recommend contrast enhanced CT and thoracic surgery consultation.

Finding: 1.5 x 1.9 cm cystic lesion in the left parotid gland with differential 
including sialocele, pleomorphic adenoma, lymphatic malformation, or first 
branchial cleft cyst. Favor a pleomorphic adenoma. Recommend contrast 
enhanced MRI or CT for further evaluation along with ENT surgery 
consultation. 
Followup: Pleomorphic adenoma, biopsy pending 
 
 
Neoplasm 
 
 
M 
 
 
65 
Finding: Two lesions as noted, the most concerning of which is a PIRADS 4 
lesion in the left posterior peripheral zone. Recommend urology consultation 
to consider targeted biopsy. The anterior transitional zone lesion is a PIRADS 
3 lesion which may represent a BPH nodule although neoplasia is within the 
differential. 
Followup: Prostate cancer confirmed. 
 
 
Neoplasm 
 
 
M 
 
 
69 
Finding: Prostate volume of [52] cc. (normal range is 15-30 cc). Right lateral 
peripheral/transitional zone lesion as noted above is stable going back two 
exams from 1/4/14 and 1/9/13. The lesion is categorized as PIRADS 3. Favor 
BPH nodule given stability, but neoplasia is within the differential. 
Recommend close imaging follow up. 
Followup: Prostate cancer confirmed and surgically resected. 
 
 
Neoplasm risk 
 
 
M 
 
 
57 
Finding: Abdomen: 4.8 cm complex left renal cyst with septations. Although 
this may represent a complex benign cyst, cystic renal call carcinoma is not 
excluded. Recommend renal mass protocol CT or MRI for further evaluation.
