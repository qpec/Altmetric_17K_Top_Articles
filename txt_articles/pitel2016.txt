INTRODUCTION
The Golden Proportion, which has sometimes been
referred to as the divine proportion, golden ratio,
golden section, or PHI is a well-known concept in the
fields of art, mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, and
architecture. Two quantities are said to be in golden
proportion if their numeric ratio is equivalent to the

 ratio of their sum to the larger of the two quantities
(Figure 1). Solving that equation yields an irrational
mathematical constant with a value of approximately
1.62. For centuries, it has been believed that this
concept plays a significant role in the human
perception of beauty and ideal form. Leonardo da
Vinci’s famous illustrations for the book, De Divina
Proportione, published in 1509, applied these concepts
to human anatomical form. In the 20th century (1978),
Edwin Levin first proposed applying the Golden
Proportion to “dental esthetics.”1 Although his paper
was purely anecdotal, Levin theorized that for optimal
dental esthetics, the apparent widths (frontal
projections) of adjacent maxillary anterior teeth should
be in golden proportion to one another (Figure 2).
That is, the apparent width (aw) of the right central
incisor should be in golden proportion to the aw of
the right lateral incisor and that aw should be in
golden proportion to its adjacent canine, and so on.
The advantages of having such an objective metric
standard to use when planning restorative dental
treatment are obvious. Later papers by several authors
challenged this concept and proposed alternate
theories and recommendations on the ideal widths of
the teeth and their dimensional relationships to each
other.2–5 To date, there has been much discussion of
the theories. There is general agreement that the
concept is very useful, but no real consensus as to
which is most ideal. Based on earlier work by
Lombardi,6 Ward proposed an iteration which he
called the “Recurring Esthetic Dental” (RED)
Proportion.7 The RED proportion theorem states that
the ratios of the apparent widths of adjacent maxillary
anterior teeth, as one moves distally from the midline,
are a constant (Figure 3). The implications of this are
that dentists or lab technicians would be free to use
any width ratio that seems to fit the case so long as
the ratios for two adjacent teeth remain constant. It is
particularly interesting to note that the Golden
Proportion of Levin is a special case of the RED
proportion where the constant c 5 0.62 5 1/u. It is
important to note that all of these theories and
measurements deal only with the “apparent” widths of
anterior teeth and do not give any consideration to
their actual mesial-distal widths nor their lengths.
While lengths of teeth and width/length ratios may
vary significantly due to age, diet, parafunctional
habits, and other factors, the widths of teeth are more
consistent from person to person and over a lifetime.8
Regardless of the tooth length, a smaller RED
proportion requires a more rapid decrease in apparent
width as you move from the dental midline distally
around the arch. In other words, a smaller RED

 proportion means the dental arch appears narrow with
smaller more slender teeth displayed whereas a larger
RED proportion means the arch appears broader and
displays fewer and larger teeth. This was one of the
criticisms for applying the golden proportion to the
widths of teeth as it tends to produce a very narrow
arch display. In his paper, Ward concluded that for
teeth of normal lengths, a RED proportion of 0.70 was
preferable to the 0.62 Golden proportion. He
attempted to validate his views with a 2007 study
comparing the preferences of some North American
Dentists for different RED proportions.9 In his
conclusions for that paper, he stated, “Duplication of
these surveys with patients would be useful to
determine if their preferences are similar to dental
practitioners. Future studies evaluating variables such
as gender, ethnicity, tooth shapes, lip characteristics,
gingival architecture, posterior teeth, and mandibular
teeth may also be useful to better define an objective
standard for smile design.” The value of understanding
and comparing the preferences of lay persons versus
professionals for esthetic parameters was demonstrated
by Kokich in his landmark paper on altered dental
esthetics.10 Our investigation sought to confirm Ward’s
RED proportion preferences for dentists as well as to
expand the analysis to the preferences of patients (lay
persons). As dental laboratory technicians may play a
significant role in the diagnosis, design, and fabrication
of indirect anterior restorative dentistry, we elected to
include them with dentists as a consolidated dental
professionals group. It is certainly useful for all dental
professionals to understand whether their education or
training has imposed any bias and whether lay patients
possess the same preferences as they do when it comes
to esthetic parameters. We also noted that Ward’s
preference study (as were many others) was limited to
evaluating a prototypical female smile in a dentofacial
view.11 So our study was expanded to include
preferences for a prototypical male smile and to test
the consistency of the preference we also examined full
facial smiling views for both male and females.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We evaluated and compared the esthetic “preferences”
of two sample groups; lay persons (patients) and dental
professionals (dentists and dental technicians) for male
and female smiles with different RED proportions.
Modern preference studies for esthetic dental
parameters often make use of computer imaging which
allows photographs of features in a smile to be digitally
altered to demonstrate specific conditions or
dimensional relationships.12,13 The digitally modified
images are then presented to test subjects who express
their preferences by rating or ranking the various
images using various survey techniques. In our study,
we digitally modified photos to display different RED
Proportions. We utilized two primary template views, a
“Dentofacial Smiling View” (lips and teeth only) as was
used by Ward and a “Facial Smiling View” (full face).
These two template views are shown in Figures 4 and
5. As dentofacial views may appear genderless whereas
facial views demonstrate male or female gender more
clearly, we thought it would be very interesting to
determine if there is a positive correlation between the
dentofacial and facial template views as well as to test
for any differences in preferences for the male or
female smile.
To accomplish this, the two primary template views
(dentofacial, facial) were subdivided into male and
female subsets for a total of four template views (i.e.,
male dentofacial and facial, female dentofacial, and
facial). To create the templates, two stock photos of a
smiling female and male face were purchased from a

 Stock Photography Agency (Bigstock, New York, NY).
The stock photos were carefully selected for male/
female faces which met all or most generally accepted
criteria for ideal esthetics (i.e., facial symmetry, dental
midline coincident with facial midline, soft tissue
health and harmony, incisal edges paralleling the lower
lip line, etc.).14,15 A graphic artist digitally altered the
template images using Photoshop CS5 Software to
remove all teeth and intraoral soft tissues leaving only
the lips and facial soft tissues as a visual scaffold. A
series of digital graphical inserts of the anterior teeth
at different RED Proportions (0.62, 0.65, 0.70, 0.75, and
0.80) was created by the graphic artist. Each of the
graphical dental inserts was then pasted back into the
facial template so that the observer could view a
completed smile and face with a series of different
RED Proportions. The dentofacial views were created
in similar fashion by cropping and enlarging only the
lips, teeth, and perioral anatomy of the previously
prepared facial views (Figure 6). This means that there
were a total of 20 computer modified images for the
viewer to rate/rank: dentofacial view, female (0.62,
0.65, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80); dentofacial view, male (0.62,
0.65, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80); facial view, female (0.62, 0.65,
0.70, 0.75, 0.80); and facial view, male (0.62, 0.65, 0.70,
0.75, 0.80). The 20 views were presented to the viewer
as four sets of five images with the different RED
proportions. We chose this specific set of RED
Proportions because we wanted to cover a broad range
of smile widths and also include the Golden
Proportion as described by Levin (0.62). For
uniformity, preference data were collected using a

 web-based survey site, Survey Monkey (www.
surveymonkey.com). No test subject was given any
information about what parameter was being
evaluated. For each group, all subjects were shown the
four sets of five individual images followed by a
photomontage of all five images and asked to rank
them from most attractive to least attractive. As this
data collection involved human subjects and the
primary data collection site was Columbia University
School of Dental Medicine, New York, NY, an IRB
approval was obtained at the University (IRB-
AAAI5151(Y1M00)). The top preference rankings by
RED proportion were analyzed and collated by
professional status/training and secondarily by narrow
(0.62, 0.65, 0.70) or broad (0.75, 0.80) preference
categories. Our data are presented as the percentage of
the study participants whose top preference was a
particular RED proportion category.
SUBJECT RECRUITMENT AND SAMPLE SIZE
Dentist subjects for the Dental Professionals group
were mainly recruited from the Columbia University
College of Dental Medicine as well as external dentists
in the NY/CT/NJ tristate area. Dental technician
subjects were recruited from several large dental
laboratories located throughout North America.
Formally trained as well as informally on-the-job
trained technicians were included in this group. The
target sample size was 100 dental professionals. We
were successful in recruiting 89 dentists and 17 dental
technicians for the dental professionals group for a
total of 106.
Subjects for the Lay Persons group were recruited
from the clinic floors at Columbia University College
of Dental Medicine as well as external lay-persons in
the NY/CT/NJ tri-state area. Any person who did not
possess an educational background or work history in
either dentistry or dental laboratory technology was
included in this group. The target sample size was 100
lay-persons and we were successful in recruiting 49 for
this group. Basic demographic information was
obtained from each subject in order to determine
which group they qualified for as well as determine
their gender, age, race, and educational level allowing
us the possibility to analyze the data collected for these
variables. All subjects signed an informed consent prior
to participation. We believe that the lower
participation level in the lay group may have been
partially due to rigorous IRB requirements as to
informed consent and the amount of documentation
that participants were required to read before
completing the survey. There were many partially
completed lay surveys which we were not able to
include in the final data.
STUDY RESULTS
For this study, we attempted to answer three
questions. (1) Is there a specific RED proportion range
that was preferred for male or female images? Note:
this is a different question than asking is there a
difference expressed by the gender of the participants.
While both males and females participated in our
preference study, the number of subjects in each
gender was disproportionate and their data were
ultimately pooled. (2) Would this preference be
expressed at both a dentofacial and facial level and if
so are they the same? (3) Is there agreement or
differences in preferences between the dental
professional group and lay-persons? To simplify the
analysis and provide a more usable clinical context, we
consolidated the five RED proportion preferences into

 two groups; narrow (0.62, 0.65, 0.70) and broad (0.75,
0.80). The selection of these two groupings was based
on Ward’s work. Any preference value � 0.70 was
assigned to the narrow category because these RED
proportions tend to yield a narrow arch display
composed of more slender appearing teeth. Any
value � 0.75 was assigned to the broad category
because of the opposite effect.
The data are illustrated in the four charts shown in
Figures 7–10 and are summarized in Table 1. Figures 7
and 8 show the charts for the male facial and
dentofacial views, respectively. Figures 9 and 10 show
the charts for the female facial and dentofacial views,
respectively. To determine if there were any differences
in esthetic preference based on dental training, we
used a Two-Sided Fisher’s Exact Test. Of the four data
sets, the male facial view (Figure 7) was the only one
which showed a small but statistically significant
difference in preference by level of professional
training (p 5 0.0204; Table 1). Here, the lay-person
group chose the narrow over broad RED proportions
with a greater percentage than dental professionals (lay
persons; 69% versus 31%) and professionals; 52% versus
48%), (Figure 7; Table 1). However, for that chart there
was qualitative agreement and no statistical differences
between the two group’s overall preferences for broad
and narrow proportions (p 5 0.2563; Table 1). A two-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA) also revealed no
significant interaction between preference and training
(p 5 0.4332). This difference by training disappeared
when participants were presented with the male
dentofacial images (Figure 8, Table 1). Figures 8–10 all
showed no qualitative or significant quantitative
differences in preference due to professional training

 (Table 1). Given that professional training did not
affect preference, we next examined RED proportion
preferences across study participant categories using a
two-Sided Chi-Square analysis with raw data. In the
male dentofacial views (Figure 8), both professionals
and lay persons show a similar slight preference for the
broad RED proportions subgroup (Professionals; 47%
versus 53% and Lay persons; 43% versus 57%), but
these preferences were not statistically significant
(p 5 0.4965; Table 1). Figure 9 is the chart of the
female facial view and Figure 10 is the female
dentofacial view. The preference values are similar in
both data sets and show that both professional and lay
groups had a strong preference for the narrow RED
proportion range. Both charts were statistically
significant with the Chi Square analysis (p < 0.0001 for
both views). In the female facial view, dental
professionals favored a narrow smile by 74% versus 26%
while lay-persons were even higher at 83%
versus 17%. The Fisher’s Exact test had a p
value 5 0.1681 indicating that the professional status
played no effect on the preference for the narrow smile
parameters. The dentofacial views of females showed a
similar preference profile. Professionals expressed a 4/1
preference (83% versus 17%) while lay persons
expressed nearly a 3/1 preference (71% versus 29%) for
the narrow proportion range (Figure 10; p < 0.0001).
Again professional experience did not influence the
preference for the narrow proportion (p 5 0.0638).
DISCUSSION
The RED proportion is an objective numerical concept
that can be used by the dentist or laboratory
technician to help design a single or multiple tooth
dental restoration, set up a removable denture or to
orthodontically move teeth into a more pleasing
esthetic arrangement. It must be considered in context
with other metrics such as width/length ratios of the
individual teeth and non-numeric considerations such
as occlusion and lip position. In this study, we sought
to answer several questions regarding the clinical
application of the RED proportion and to confirm and
expand upon a previous preference study by Ward.
While Ward surveyed only dentists, we included both
dentists and laboratory technicians as a single dental
professional group and contrasted their preferences
with those of lay-persons. Following a pattern of many
other investigators, Ward utilized only a prototypical
female dentofacial smile, while we included both
dentofacial male and female smiles. Our study also
included full facial prototypes of the smiling male and
female in an effort to evaluate the consistency of the
preference and to help demonstrate any gender
differences. We grouped the RED proportion
categories into narrow and broad, to provide a useful
clinical context. This allowed us to clearly demonstrate
that for dental professionals there was no RED
proportion preference in either the male full facial
views or the male dentofacial views. Lay-persons did
express a preference for a narrow RED proportion
when viewing the male face but when the close-up
dentofacial views were considered, that preference did
not remain. Although it was not statistically significant,
we found it interesting that both dental professionals
and lay-persons showed a slight preference for the
broader RED proportions (0.75, 0.80) in the male
dentofacial views. This finding corresponds with the
well-known esthetic stereotype for males to have

 larger, more squarely shaped teeth while females
should have smaller more slender and delicate
appearing anterior teeth. For all of the female views
(facial and dentofacial), both dental professionals and
lay-persons expressed a very strong preference for the
narrow RED proportions (0.62, 0.65, 0.70) which again
corresponds to the gender stereotype for female
anterior maxillary teeth.
CONCLUSIONS
This study confirms the work of Ward who reported
that 0.70 was the preferred RED proportion for the
female smile. This study also indicates that professional
training does not introduce a bias into the choice of
RED proportion. The conclusion that can be drawn
from our work is that dental professionals who are
developing a treatment plan should attempt to utilize a
RED proportion � 0.70 for both male and female
patients. This provides the clinician and the laboratory
technician with an acceptable range of apparent width
values which can help accommodate for variations in
individual tooth length and lip position, etc. and which
are likely to be esthetically accepted by their patients.
