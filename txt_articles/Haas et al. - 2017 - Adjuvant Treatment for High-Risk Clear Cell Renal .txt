IMPORTANCE Given recently published results of a 750-patient adjuvant sunitinib trial
showing improved disease-free survival (DFS), the appropriate strategy for treating high-risk
patients is unclear. We sought to determine whether there is improved disease-free survival
benefit to taking the active drug in patients with high-risk (pT3, pT4, node-positive) clear cell
renal cancer (ccRCC) in the ASSURE trial (adjuvant sunitinib or sorafenib vs placebo in
resected unfavorable renal cell carcinoma [RCC]), the largest adjuvant trial published to date.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate DFS and overall survival (OS) in ccRCC high-risk patients randomized
to sunitinib or sorafenib vs placebo among patients with stages comparable to other high-risk
adjuvant trials.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The DFS and OS at 10 years postactivation were
calculated for 1069 patients in US and Canadian cooperative groups with high-risk patients
who had ccRCC histology and pT3, pT4, or node-positive disease accrued between 2006 and
2010 to the double-blind randomized placebo-controlled phase 3 trial. Outcome analyses by
dose quartiles of these patients receiving sunitinib or sorafenib were also performed.
INTERVENTIONS Patients received 1 year of adjuvant sunitinib (50 mg), sorafenib (800 mg)
daily, or equivalent placebo. The study was amended for patient intolerance to sunitinib (37.5
mg), sorafenib (400 mg) daily, or equivalent placebo with mandatory dose escalation if no
serious adverse effects were experienced.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Disease-free survival, defined as time from randomization
to recurrence, second primary cancer, or death.
RESULTS Of 1069 patients, 358 (243 [67.9%] men, 115 [32.1%] women) received sunitinib,
355 (248 [69.9%] men, 107 [30.1%] women) received sorafenib, and 356 (254 [71.3%] men,
102 [28.7%] women) received placebo as adjuvant therapy. The mean (SD) age for each
group was 58.3 (10.6) years, 56.8 (10.3) years, and 57.5 (10.4) years, respectively. Five-year
DFS rates were 47.7%, 49.9%, and 50.0%, respectively for sunitinib, sorafenib, and placebo
(HR, 0.94 for sunitinib vs placebo; and HR, 0.90; 97.5% CI, 0.71-1.14 for sorafenib vs placebo),
with 5-year OS of 75.2%, 80.2%, and 76.5% (HR, 1.06; 97.5% CI, 0.78-1.45; P = .66, sunitinib
vs placebo; and HR, 0.80; 97.5% CI, 0.58-1.11; P = .12 for sorafenib vs placebo). There was no
difference by dose quartile.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Neither prognostic category of the tumor nor dose intensity
of therapy altered the lack of difference in DFS or OS in this population of patients with
high-risk ccRCC.

e recently reported no improvement in disease-
freesurvival(DFS)inourprimaryanalysisofthefirst
and largest adjuvant vascular endothelial growth
factor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGF-TKIs) trial in primary
resected renal cell carcinoma (RCC), E2805/ASSURE.1 Some
currentadjuvanttrialsofVEGF-TKIsincludeonlypatientswith
higher-stage RCC (pT3/4 or node-positive) and clear cell his-
tology, because this population has a median time to progres-
sion of less than 1 year.2,3
Given recently published results of a 750-patient random-
ized trial, S-TRAC, (sunitinib 50 mg daily [4/2 schedule] vs pla-
cebo in clear cell predominant pT3-4 or node-positive disease)
thatshowimprovedDFS,4theappropriateadjuvantstrategyfor
high-risk patients is unclear. Herein we provide an updated
analysis of a high-risk subset in ASSURE (pT3/4 or node-
positive and clear cell histology). The objectives of this analy-
siswerefirsttoevaluateDFSandOSinthispopulation,andsec-
ond, to evaluate the impact of dose intensity on outcome.
Methods
Patients
This analysis included patients with clear cell (histologically
>25%) only disease, high-risk patients with pT3, pT4, or node-
positive disease.5
Treatment
Patients were randomized in double-blind fashion to receive
54 weeks of either sunitinib, 50 mg, oral daily for 28 of 42 days
per cycle, or sorafenib, 400 mg, oral twice daily continu-
ously, or placebo. In 2009, to address toxic effects, starting
doses were amended to 37.5 mg (sunitinib/placebo), or 400 mg
(sorafenib/placebo), for the first 1 to 2 cycles of therapy, and
escalated to full doses if adverse effects were grade 2 or lower.
Dose reductions down to 25 mg daily for sunitinib/placebo or
400 mg every other day for sorafenib/placebo for toxic ef-
fects were permitted. Compliance was assessed using a pill di-
ary and pill count.
Study Oversight
The E2805 trial was led by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG-ACRIN) with Southwest Oncology Group, Alli-
ance, and National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials
Group participation. It was overseen by an independent data
monitoring committee, and approved by the institutional re-
view board at each center with informed written consent ob-
tained from the participants.
The clinical database as of July 16, 2016, was analyzed by
the study statistician (J.M.).
Statistical Analysis
Disease-free survival was defined as time from randomiza-
tion to recurrence, second primary cancer, or death without
recurrenceorsecondprimary.Patientsfreeoftheseeventswere
censored at the date of last disease evaluation. Patients with
residual disease after surgery were considered to have re-
curred on day 1. Overall survival was defined as time from ran-
domization to death. Patients alive at analysis were censored
at the date of last contact.
Groups were compared using the Wald test from Cox pro-
portional hazards models stratified on histology, perfor-
mance status, type of nephrectomy, and risk category.6 Be-
causetherewere2arm-wisecomparisons,97.5%CIsareshown.
These are primarily post hoc subset analyses. Given the ret-
rospective nature of these analyses, the type I error is not con-
trolled, and P values should be interpreted with caution. Quar-
tiles of dose were formed by summing the total doses taken
per cycle reported for each patient across all cycles, dividing
by the number of cycles, and finding the quartiles of the re-
sulting distribution. Dose intensity was affected by both holds
and reductions.

6-week cycle. The expected full doses per 6-week cycle were
Key Points
Questions Do high-risk clear cell renal cancer (ccRCC) (�pT3 or
node-positive) patients receiving adjuvant sunitinib or sorafenib
have improved disease-free survival, and does the dose intensity
of either drug affect outcome?
Findings In a secondary analysis of a high-risk subset of patients
in the ASSURE randomized trial, 5-year disease-free survival rates
were 47.7%, 49.9%, and 50.0% respectively for sunitinib,
sorafenib, and placebo. Dose intensity did not affect outcome.
Meaning There was no benefit to adjuvant sunitinib or sorafenib
in this high-risk ccRCC population, and there was no difference in
outcome by dose quartile.

CI,0.78-1.45;P = .66],sorafenibvsplacebo[HR,0.80;97.5%CI,
0.58-1.11; P = .12]). This is shown in Figure 2, B. Overall survival
bydosepercyclequartileamongpatientsrandomizedtosunitinib
or sorafenib is shown in eFigure 2, A and B, in the Supplement.
Adverse Events
Grade 3 or higher adverse events were reported by 66%, 72%,
and 28% of patients in this cohort randomized to sunitinib,
sorafenib, and placebo, respectively (eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment), underscoring a high rate of adverse effects.
Discussion
High-risk patients might be the ideal population in which to
detect activity of adjuvant sunitinib or sorafenib. Consistent
with the primary analysis,1 our analysis of E2805 patients with
ccRCC and high-risk (pT3 and higher or node-positive) dis-
ease showed no statistically significant benefit from these
agents vs placebo. In addition, we observed no difference in
outcome by dose quartile. This high-risk population had a bet-
ter 5-year recurrence-free rate (around 50%) than expected
(41.9% for high-risk disease and 36.0% for node-positive
disease),5 possibly a result of better surgical technique, more
accurate staging, or unknown biologic factors. Five-year DFS
was similar to that observed in another contemporary trial.8
Ongoing correlative analyses are designed to identify subsets
that may benefit from adjuvant therapy.
We asked if patients who received higher doses of suni-
tinib or sorafenib might have fared differently than those who
received lower doses. Our DFS results did not show a meaning-
ful difference by dose quartile. Duration of therapy or starting
dose, likewise, had no effect on our primary outcome of DFS.
Limitations
This analysis has limitations: the ccRCC cohort was prespeci-
fied but analysis of dosing cohorts and higher stage were
posthoc;thetrialwasnotpoweredtodetectdifferencesinthese
subsets.However,thesamplesizewaslargeenoughthataclini-
cally meaningful difference would be observable in the graphi-
cal portrayal of DFS. The subsets that involve dosing are not
free of bias, because they were formed using information that
arose after randomization.
Conclusions
These analyses shed light on the impact of adjuvant therapy
and dose in this high-risk population. Using key questions to
examinefailedprimaryoutcomesofrandomizedclinicaltrials,9
our subgroup findings did not elicit positive signals in these
patients. Furthermore, the lack of efficacy is not attributable
to low dose-intensity. Based on this analysis, a rationale for ad-
juvant therapy in this high-risk population is not elucidated.
