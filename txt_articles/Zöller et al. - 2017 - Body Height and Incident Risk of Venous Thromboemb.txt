reater height and long legs have been associated with 
an increased risk of incident venous thromboembolism 
(VTE), but results are divergent.1–9 One study by Schmidt et 
al10 found no association between VTE and height. Moreover, 
Braekkan et al4 found an association between height and VTE 
only among men and not among women. Similarly, Flinterman 
et al8 found only weak nonsignificant associations between 
height and VTE for women. This might be related to the fact 
that men are taller than women in general. An association 
between recurrent VTE and height has also been observed.8,11 
Still, a plausible explanation exists for an association between 
great height and increased VTE risk. Tall people and those 
with long legs may be subject to greater stasis in the legs as a 
consequence of greater hydrostatic pressure.12–14

Height is highly heritable.15 Thus, genetic variants could be 
related to an increased VTE incidence. However, the common 
genetic variants related to height are individually only weakly 
associated with height although they together explain a large 
part of the heritability of height.16 A genetic risk score of 696 
variants, however, could be worthwhile to determine whether 
it is associated with VTE.17 In a modern Western society, 20% 
of the variation in body height is because of environmental 
causes.18 In poorer societies, the influence of the environment 
might be even stronger. Important nongenetic factors affecting 
growth and adult body height are nutrition, diseases, socioeco-
nomic status, and environmental factors in childhood.18–20
Observational studies have shown an association 
between body height and VTE,1–9 but concerns remain about 
confounding variables. In the current study, we used a cosi-
bling design.21–24 Traditionally, in this approach, the associa-
tion between an exposure and an outcome is compared in the 
general population and in full siblings. From the pattern of 
the associations in these 2 groups, it is possible to assess the 
degree to which the association observed in the population 
might be causal versus because of confounding from familial 
factors (genetic/environmental).21–24 The use of sibling pair 
analysis reduces the influence of familial confounding. If 
Background—Body height has been associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), but the 
association can be confounded with shared familial factors (genetic/environmental). A cosibling design is useful for 
deeper understanding about the relationship between VTE and height.
Methods and Results—From Swedish national registry databases, we used a corelative design with full siblings alongside 
a general Swedish population sample. A cohort of male conscripts (n=1 610 870), born in 1951 to 1992 without previous 
VTE, was followed from enlistment (1969–2010) until 2012. Another cohort of first-time pregnant women (n=1 093 342) 
from the medical birth register, without previous VTE, was followed from first pregnancy (1982–2012) until 2012. Using 
the Multi-Generation Register, we identified all full-sibling pairs discordant for height. This cosibling design allowed 
for adjustment for familial factors (genetic/environmental). Compared with the tallest women (>185 cm) and men (>190 
cm), there was a graded decreased risk by lower height for both men and women. The risk was lowest in women and 
men with the shortest stature (<155 and <160 cm, respectively): hazard ratios=0.31 (95% confidence interval, 0.22–0.42) 
and 0.35 (95% confidence interval, 0.22–0.55), respectively. There was a graded association also in the cosibling design 
comparing siblings with varying degree of discordance for height (reference was the taller sibling): ≥10 cm difference 
between brothers hazard ratios=0.69 (95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.78) and sisters hazard ratios=0.65 (95% confidence 
interval, 0.52–0.80), respectively.
Conclusions—Height is an independent predictor of VTE. The use of sibling pairs reduces the likelihood that familial 
confounding explains the results. The findings are important for the understanding of the pathogenesis of VTE.  (Circ

a significant association between height and VTE was not 
detected in sibling pairs, it would weaken the argument that 
height is a causal risk factor for VTE. The aims of this study 
were to explore the association between height and VTE in 
a nationwide follow-up study using Swedish national reg-
istry databases to ascertain the risk of VTE and to further 
examine whether these associations persisted within nested 
sibling pairs.
Methods
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Lund University, 
Sweden. Data used in this study represented information on individu-
als registered as residents of Sweden who either belonged to a cohort 
of male conscripts (n=1 610 870) born in 1951 to 1992 with no history 
of previous VTE or to a cohort of first-time pregnant women from 
the medical birth register with no history of previous VTE with first 
pregnancy (n=1 093 342) in 1982 to 2012.25–32 It included individual-
level information on the following: enlistment, births, age, height, 
weight, body mass index (BMI), sex, educational attainments, hos-
pital and outpatient diagnoses, dates of hospital admissions, date of 
emigration, and date and cause of death. The data sources were mul-
tiple national Swedish data registers, including the Swedish National 
Population and Housing Census, the Total Population Register, the 
Swedish Hospital Register (the Hospital Discharge Register and 
the Hospital Outpatient Register), Military Conscription Register, 
Medical Birth Register, and the Multi-generation Register.25–32 These 
registers were provided to us by Statistics Sweden and the National 
Board of Health and Welfare. Using the Swedish Hospital Register, 
we identified hospital inpatients and outpatients, with diagnoses of 
VTE in Sweden, between January 1, 1969, and December 31, 2012. 
Data were linked using the individual personal identification numbers 
that are assigned to all persons in Sweden for their lifetime. These 
numbers were replaced with serial numbers to maintain anonymity. 
The serial numbers were used to check that each individual was only 
entered once for his or her first diagnosis of VTE diagnosis (inpatient 
or outpatient and death registers). The follow-up ran from January 1, 
1969 (men) or 1982 (women) until a VTE event, death, emigration, 
or the end of the follow-up on December 31, 2012, whichever came 
first. This register does not include data for patients treated at pri-
mary healthcare centers, but diagnosis of VTE is not done in primary 
healthcare in Sweden.
Outcome Variable and Ascertainment of Cases
Cases of VTE, classified according to the World Health Organization 
International Classification of Diseases (International Classification 
of Diseases Eighth Revision, Ninth Revision, and Tenth Revision), 
were identified in the Hospital Discharge Register and the Outpatient 
Register 2001 to 2010 (Table I in the Data Supplement). The defini-
tion of VTE has been the same over time although the diagnostic 
methods may have changed (ie, more computed tomographic scans 
and ultrasound examinations). All VTE cases in Sweden are initially 
diagnosed and treated in the hospital specialist clinics (outpatient or 
inpatient care). The Swedish Hospital Discharge Register has ≈90% 
overall validity or positive predictive values.27,29 The positive predic-
tive values for cardiovascular disorders, such as VTE, myocardial 
infarction, and stroke, are ≈90% to 95%.3,27,29 Negative predictive 
values for common cardiovascular diagnosis vary between 95.0% 
and 99.8%.27
In a Swedish study of men with VTE, hospital records were avail-
able for 304 cases (1970–1998).3 A total of 289 of 304 (95%) cases, 
with diagnosed VTE, were judged to be diagnosed correctly.3 Only 12 
(3.9%) cases were not diagnosed with an objectively verified method 
but were treated with oral anticoagulation because of strong clini-
cal probability. In total, 277 (91%) cases were objectively diagnosed 
with methods, such as phlebography, ultrasound, computed tomo-
graphic scan, and pulmonary scintigraphy.3 The Outpatient Register 
has not previously been validated for VTE. Recently, Abdul Sultan 
et al33 found that only 57% of pregnant VTE cases first recorded as 
outpatients were accompanied by anticoagulant prescriptions, where-
as this proportion was much lower than those cases first recorded in 
the inpatient register (91%). Moreover, in a previous study of ours, 
we used Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System 
codes for anticoagulant drugs to validate the whole outpatient and 
inpatient registers with prescription of anticoagulant drugs after VTE 
diagnosis.34 The prescription register is only available from July 2005. 
Positive predictive values for inpatient diagnosis of VTE were similar 
to published data by Rosengren et al3 and Abdul Sultan et al.33,34 An 
outpatient diagnosis of VTE had less validity, similar to Abdul Sultan 
et al,33 but the presence of VTE diagnosis on 2 occasions in outpa-
tients was associated with high positive predictive values (ie, antico-
agulant prescription), similar to what was observed in the study by 
Rosengren et al.3,34 We, therefore, classified only outpatient diagnosis 
of VTE if diagnosis had occurred twice in outpatients while 1 event 
of VTE in inpatients is enough to be classified as VTE.
Main Predictor Variable
Height (cm) and weight (kg) and BMI were obtained from the 
Swedish military conscription register for the male cohort at the time 
of enlistment.32 Height and weight and BMI were obtained from the 
Swedish Medical birth register for the female cohort.30,31 We used 
height and weight register at the start of the first pregnancy.
Potential Confounders
Adjustments were made for potential confounders: BMI, age at 
first pregnancy (women only because men were all aged 18–20 
years at enlistment), education, year of enlistment (men) or year of 
first pregnancy (women), and family history of VTE 1969 to 2012 
(Table I in the Data Supplement) in first-degree relatives (parent/
sibling). Education was used as a proxy for socioeconomic status. 
Education was classified as completion of compulsory school or 
less (≤9 years), practical high school (10–12 years), or theoretical 
high school or college (≥13 years). BMI was calculated by divid-
ing weight (kg) by the square of height (m). In Tables II and II in 
the Data Supplement, the associations between height and potential 
confounders are presented.
Statistical Analysis
The log-rank test was used to examine the difference of VTE-free 
survival curve. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios 
(HRs)35 and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for subsequent VTE in 
patients with different height and was controlled for potential media-
tors or confounders by the selected demographic characteristics (age 
[continuous variable], education level, BMI, family history of VTE 
[parent/sibling], and year of first pregnancy as a continuous variable 
[women] or enlistment [men]). We censored individuals (ie, treated 
them as no longer under observation or at risk of the study outcome) 
at the time of death from any cause, at the end of the follow-up pe-
riod (December 31, 2012), or at the time of emigration. The propor-
tional hazards assumption was tested using Schoenfeld residuals and 
by plotting the log of the negative log of the survival function ver-
sus the log of time.36 A scaled version of the Schoenfeld residual at 
time k for a particular covariate p will approximate the change in 
the regression coefficient at time k. We used scatter plot smooths to 
explore the scaled Schoenfeld residuals’ relationship with time, and 
we found that the smooths seem mostly flat at 0, suggesting that the 
coefficient for age does not change over time and that proportional 
hazards hold for this covariate. We also tested for interactions be-
tween variables, but no significant interaction was observed. Using 
the Swedish Multi-Generation Register, we identified all full-sibling 
pairs with a maximum of 5 cm height difference, between 5 and 9 cm 
height difference, and with ≥10 cm height difference. Using strati-
fied Cox proportional hazards models, we performed an analysis of 
these full-sibling pairs. Stratification was used to compare sibling 
pairs. This was done in SAS using the strata statement (SAS ver-
sion 9.2, SAS Institute, Cary, NC).37 The corelative design allows 
us to contrast the rates of VTE in relatives with different levels of 
height difference. Reference is the taller siblings. The stratified Cox

proportional hazards model provides a HR for VTE that is adjusted 
for familial confounding (genetic/environmental).21–24,37 Cumulative 
5-year incidence rates were calculated by lifetest in SAS. The data 
were transferred to Excel, and Figures 1 and 2 were created in Excel. 
Data are accurate to 2 decimals places. All analyses were performed 
using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Results
HR for VTE According to Height in Male 
Conscripts
Characteristics of the male conscript cohort are shown in 
Table 1. The total follow-up for male conscripts was 41 346 944 
person-years. Table 1 shows the crude and adjusted HR results 
for VTE in male conscripts at enlistment between 1969 and 
2010. The adjusted HR decreased with 65% for men shorter 
than 160 cm compared with the tallest men (≥190 cm). The 
95% CI were narrow. The HRs showed a clear gradient with 
decreased HR for VTE incidence for every 10 cm of decreased 
height compared with the tallest men. This is also evident in 
Figure 1, which shows the cumulative incidence of VTE by 
height in male conscripts in Sweden. The incidence rates for 
VTE were 26.6, 35.4, 41.4, 51.3, and 69.5 per 100 000 person-
years. Only small differences in HRs were observed for the 
crude and adjusted models. In the adjusted model, the results 
were independent of enlistment year (not shown in table), 
BMI, family history of VTE (parent/sibling), and educational 
attainment (Table 1).
HR for VTE According to Height in Women 
Pregnant at Least Once
Characteristics of the female first pregnant cohort are shown 
in Table 2. The follow-up for first pregnant women was 
14 351 631 person-years. Table 2 presents the crude and 
adjusted HR results for VTE in women at the start of the first 
pregnancy between 1982 and 2012. The HR decreased with 
69% for women shorter than 155 cm compared with the tall-
est women (≥185 cm). The 95% CIs were narrow. The HRs 
showed a clear gradient with decreased HR for VTE incidence 
for every 10 cm of decreased height compared with the tall-
est women. This is also evident in Figure 2, which shows the 
cumulative incidence of VTE by height in first-time pregnant 
women in Sweden. The incidence rates for VTE were 65.9, 
74.1, 94.1, 128.3, and 216.2 per 100 000 person-years. In the 
adjusted model, the results were independent of age at first 
birth, year of first birth, BMI, family history of VTE (parent/
sibling), and educational attainment.

Subanalysis of Thrombosis in the Legs (Venous 
Thrombosis), Pulmonary Embolism, and Other 
Venous Locations (Others)
Among men, a graded association with height was observed 
for both pulmonary embolism and venous thrombosis of the 
legs and venous thrombosis at locations other than the legs and 
lungs (others; Table III in the Data Supplement). Others include 
migrating thrombophlebitis, cerebral vein thrombosis, portal 
vein thrombosis, Budd–Chiari syndrome, vena cava thrombo-
sis, renal vein thrombosis, and other rare types of venous throm-
botic events (International Classification of Diseases codes are 
defined in Table III in the Data Supplement). Among women, 
only venous thrombosis of the legs was significantly associated 
with height. No significant associations were observed with 
pulmonary embolism and venous thrombosis at other locations.
Corelative Analysis in Full Siblings
In the sibling pair analysis, the taller sibling was reference. A 
strong and graded association was observed among both women 
and men although among women a significant association was 
noted only for a difference of ≥10 cm (HR for sisters=0.65; 95% 
CI, 0.52–0.80; P<0.001; Table 3). In general, the 95% CIs were 
narrow because of the large sample sizes. Height difference 
between brothers ≥10 cm was associated with a HR of 0.69 (95% 
CI, 0.61–0.78; P<0.001). A strong association with VTE was 
also observed for as little as 5 to 9 cm among male full-sib pairs 
(HR=0.80; 95% CI, 0.73–0.87; P<0.001) but only borderline sig-
nificant in females full-sib pairs (HR=0.90; 95% CI, 0.79–1.01; 
P=0.07). The association between VTE and difference of 10 cm 
was not weaker than among the general population sample. As 
there was a strong association between height and VTE in the 
sibling pair analysis, when adjusting for familial confounding, 
we did not perform any analysis of half-siblings and first cousins.
Discussion
The present study shows a strong association between VTE and 
height among both men and women. Thus, the association of 
height on VTE is not limited to men but is also valid for women. 
The present study is the largest epidemiological study and the 
only nationwide study of VTE and height, as well as the first

using a cosibling design. Our study also shows that the associa-
tion between height and VTE is graded and valid for different 
manifestations of VTE. Most importantly, use of sibling pair 
analysis, which reduces the influence of familial confound-
ing, showed a strong association between VTE and height. 
The present study does not argue against that the association 
between height and VTE may be causal. Moreover, the pres-
ent study is in agreement with a recently published Mendelian 
randomization study that indicates that tall height is a risk fac-
tor for VTE.38 This suggests a robustness of our study design 
(nationwide cosibling study). The association between height 
and VTE may partly contribute to several phenomena. Pos-
tural effects on circulation have been suggested to be the result 
from the distension of vessels (particularly veins) subsequent 
to changes in gravitational pressure of blood.39 For instance, 
the low incidence of VTE in children could partly be related 
to height, with expected lower effect of gravitational pressure 
of blood, although of course hormonal influence is also impor-
tant.40 The gravitational pressure of blood in the arms is also 
expected to be lower than in the legs and may explain the much 
lower incidence of deep venous thrombosis in the arms than 
in the legs. The same is true on the gravitational pressure of 
blood in visceral veins and veins of the brain, which are all rare 
manifestations of VTE.41 The present study showed, among 
women, only an association with venous thrombosis of the legs 
indicating that the stasis theory (in Virchow triad) could be true. 
However, among men, all types of VTE were associated with 
height, suggesting a systemic hypercoagulability induced by 
height indicating that other mechanisms might also be involved.
The present study has several strengths. These include 
nationwide coverage in a country of high medical standards 
supervised by the Swedish National Board of Health and 
Welfare, together with diagnoses of patients by specialist phy-
sicians during examinations in clinics. Data in the Swedish 
registers are almost complete. In 2001, personal identity num-
bers were missing for only 0.4% of hospitalizations and main 
diagnoses for 0.9% of hospitalizations.26
A limitation is that we did not have access to individual-
level data for childhood and parent lifestyle factors, such as 
smoking, diet, and physical activity in. However, we adjusted 
for educational level that is related to several lifestyle factors. 
Education is also known to be associated with height, but still 
there was an association between height and VTE.19,42 A weak-
ness is that the hospital register was not nationwide until 1987 
and that the hospital outpatient register is only from 2001. 
However, this is most likely a nondifferential bias on associa-
tion between height and VTE. In addition, this has probably 
not affected the association between height and VTE because, 
previously, most patients with VTE were treated as inpatients. 
The definition of VTE is the same over time although the 
diagnostic methods may have changed. However, the results 
are adjusted for year of enlistment (men) or year of first birth 
(women) to account for any potential differences related to 
time period.
In conclusion, body height is an independent predictor for 
VTE both among men and women. The use of sibling pairs 
reduces the likelihood that familial confounding explains the 
results.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
Body height has been associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), but the association can be con-
founded with shared familial factors (genetic/environmental). A cosibling design is useful for deeper understanding about 
the independent relationship between VTE and height. A nationwide Swedish cohort of male conscripts (n=1 610 870) and 
another cohort of first-time pregnant women (n=1 093 342) from the medical birth register, without previous VTE, were fol-
lowed until 2012. Compared with the tallest women (>185 cm) and men (>190 cm), there was a graded decreased risk by 
lower height for both men and women. The risk was lowest in women and men with the shortest stature (<155 and <160 
cm, respectively): hazard ratios=0.31 (95% confidence interval, 0.22–0.42) and 0.35 (95% confidence interval, 0.22–0.55), 
respectively. There was a graded association also in the cosibling design comparing siblings with varying degree of discor-
dance for height. Height is an independent predictor of VTE for both men and women. The use of sibling pairs reduces the 
likelihood that familial confounding explains the results. The findings are important for the understanding of the pathogen-
esis of VTE. In clinical practice, height is an easy accessible risk factor that might be useful to include in risk assessment.
