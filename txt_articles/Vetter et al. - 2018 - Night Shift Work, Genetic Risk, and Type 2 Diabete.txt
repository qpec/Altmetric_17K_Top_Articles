OBJECTIVE
To examine the effects of past and current night shift work and genetic type 2
diabetes vulnerability on type 2 diabetes odds.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
In the UK Biobank, we examined associations of current (N = 272,214) and lifetime
(N = 70,480) night shift work exposure with type 2 diabetes risk (6,770 and 1,191
prevalent cases, respectively). For 180,704 and 44,141 unrelated participants of
European ancestry (4,002 and 726 cases, respectively) with genetic data, we assessed
whether shift work exposure modified the relationship between a genetic risk score
(comprising 110 single-nucleotide polymorphisms) for type 2 diabetes and prevalent
diabetes.
RESULTS
Compared with day workers, all current night shift workers were at higher multivari-
able-adjusted odds for type 2 diabetes (none or rare night shifts: odds ratio [OR] 1.15
[95% CI 1.05–1.26]; some nights: OR 1.18 [95% CI 1.05–1.32]; and usual nights: OR
1.44 [95% CI1.19–1.73]), exceptcurrent permanent night shift workers(OR1.09 [95%
CI 0.93–1.27]). Considering a person’s lifetime work schedule and compared with
never shift workers, working more night shifts per month was associated with higher
type 2 diabetes odds (<3/month: OR 1.24 [95% CI 0.90–1.68]; 3–8/month: OR 1.11
[95% CI 0.90–1.37]; and >8/month: OR 1.36 [95% CI 1.14–1.62]; Ptrend = 0.001). The
association between genetic type 2 diabetes predisposition and type 2 diabetes odds
was not modified by shift work exposure.
CONCLUSIONS
Our findings show that night shift work, especially rotating shift work including night
shifts, is associated with higher type 2 diabetes odds and that the number of night
shifts worked per month appears most relevant for type 2 diabetes odds. Also, shift
work exposure does not modify genetic risk for type 2 diabetes, a novel finding that
warrants replication.
Shift work has become increasingly common since industrialization, with ;10% of the
workforce in the Western world exposed to night work, including permanent night
shifts, rotating shifts, and irregular schedules (1). Shift work, particularly night shifts,
disrupts socialandbiological rhythms,aswell as sleep,andthrough those pathwayshas
been suggested to increase the risk of metabolic disorders and specifically type 2
diabetes (2–6). With the prevalence of type 2 diabetes on the rise, understanding
which aspects of shift work schedules might be most disruptive, and for whom, is

 critical for designing targeted primary and
secondary prevention strategies, which
ultimately could help reduce disease-
related societal burden and economic
cost (7).
A recent meta-analysis of the associa-
tion between shift work and type 2 dia-
betes, including eight prospective cohort
studies and four cross-sectional studies
(N = 226,652) (8), reported that shift
workers had an overall 9% higher type 2
diabetes risk than day workers. However,
results differed significantly across stud-
ies, possibly because of heterogeneous
work schedule definitions. Further, using
limited shift work information, the same
meta-analysis observed that specifically
rotating shifts with night shifts, mixed
shifts, and rotating shifts without night
shifts was associated with a 40–73%
higher type 2 diabetes risk. Recent evi-
dence also suggests that late chronotypes
(i.e., individuals synchronizing later to the
24-h light/dark cycle, so that peaks and
troughs in physiology and behavior occur
later within the 24-h day) will suffer less
from circadian and sleep disruption when
working night shifts, as compared with
early types (9). Accounting for chrono-
type may therefore better delineate
acute and chronic health effects of shift
work (10–13). Data from the Nurses’
Health Study II (NHSII) showed that, com-
pared with intermediate chronotypes,
early types, but not late ones, had an in-
creasing type 2 diabetes risk with longer
durations of night shift work (14). Given
the potentially important role of chrono-
type for individually tailored prevention
strategies (15), replication of those initial
findings is necessary.
In addition to environmental factors
such as shift work, genetics also play a
role in type 2 diabetes risk. Genome-
wide association studies have identi-
fied .120 independent loci associated
with type 2 diabetes (16). Because life-
style and environmental factors may
modify genetic predisposition to chronic
disease (e.g., Khera et al. [17]), we also
examined whether lifetime night work ex-
posure modifies the association of ge-
netic predisposition and type 2 diabetes
risk, a question currently unexplored.
In this study of .270,000 participants,
we testedthe hypothesis that currentand
past shift work, especially involving night
shifts, is associated with higher odds of
type 2 diabetes. Using lifetime employ-
ment reports, we examined whether
longer duration and more frequent night
shift work are associated with higher
type 2 diabetes odds. Finally, among
those participants with genetic informa-
tion, we also explored whether shift
work modifies the genetic type 2 diabetes
predisposition.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
UK Biobank
From 2006 to 2010, the UK Biobank re-
cruited 502,620 individuals from across
the U.K. At this baseline assessment, par-
ticipantsreportedontheirlifestyle,medical
conditions, work hours, and demographic
information; medical history, health status,
and medication intake were queried by
trained health professionals. The UK Bio-
bank and current validation efforts have
been described in detail elsewhere (18).
We restricted our analyses to participants
in paid employment or who were self-
employed at baseline (N = 287,222). We
excluded individuals with prevalent
chronic disease at baseline (i.e., breast,
prostate, bowel, or lung cancer, heart dis-
ease, or stroke; N = 15,008), so that our
analytic sample consisted of 272,214
participants (38–71 years, 180,704 with
genetic data). Out of those, 70,480 par-
ticipants provided in-depth lifetime em-
ployment information by filling out an
online follow-up questionnaire in 2015,
which was e-mailed to all ;330,000 UK
Biobank participants with known e-mail
addresses, regardless of employment sta-
tus and shift work at baseline (19); a sub-
group of 44,141 participants of European
descent also had genetic data available.
The UK Biobank study was approved by
the National Health Service National Re-
search Ethics Service (ref. 11/NW/0382),
and all participants provided written in-
formed consent to participate in the UK
Biobank study.
Exposure and Outcome Assessment
Shift Work Assessment
Participants employed at baseline were
asked to report whether their current
main job involved shift work (i.e., a sched-
ule falling outside of 9:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M.;
by definition, such schedules involved
afternoon, evening, or night shifts or ro-
tating through these shifts). If yes, partic-
ipants were further asked whether their
main job involved night shifts, defined
as “. . .a work schedule that involves
working through the normal sleeping
hours, for instance, working through the
hours from 12:00 A.M. to 6:00 A.M.” For
both questions, response options were
“never/rarely,” “sometimes,” “usually,”
or “always” and included additional op-
tions: “prefer not to answer” and “do
not know.” Based on those two ques-
tions, we derived participants’ current
shift work status, categorized as “day
workers,” “shift workers, but only rarely,
if ever night shifts,” “irregular or rotating
shifts with some night shifts,” “irregular
or rotating shifts with usual night shifts,”
and “permanent night shifts.”
In the lifetime employment assess-
ment, individuals reported each job ever
worked, the number of years in each job,
and the number of night shifts per month
each job entailed. Using that information,
we aggregated duration (i.e., number of
years working night shifts) and frequency
(i.e., the average number of night shifts
per month) of night shift work. We also
derived cumulative lifetime night shift
exposure (i.e., a count of all night shifts
worked throughout lifetime).
Polygenic Risk Score for Type 2
Diabetes
Genotyping in the UK Biobank was per-
formed on two arrays, UK BiLEVE and UK
Biobank Axiom. Genotyping, quality con-
trol, and imputation procedures have
been previously described in detail (20).
A total of 488,377 participants in the UK
Biobank were genotyped. In total,
180,704 unrelated samples of European
ancestry with high-quality genotyping,
work, and covariate data were used for
these analyses, of which 44,141 also re-
ported on lifetime employment. We
derived a genetic risk score (GRS) for
type 2 diabetes using those 110 single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which
passed quality control, out of the 128 re-
cently reported to be associated with
type 2 diabetes at genome-wide signifi-
cance in Europeans (16). Individual partic-
ipant scores were created by summing
the number of risk alleles at each genetic
variant, which were weighted by the re-
spective allelic effect sizes on type 2 di-
abetes risk reported by Scott et al. (16).A
second GRS (GRS10) was derived from a
subset of 10 SNPs with a reported odds
ratio (OR) .1.2 for type 2 diabetes (16).

 status. In brief, the algorithm uses self-
reported and trained health professional
queried medical history and medication
use at baseline to derive case status. It
was validated in a subset of UK Biobank
participants against primary and second-
ary medical records, with 96% accuracy.
Chronotype Ascertainment
Participants self-reported chronotype
on a touch-screen questionnaire at base-
line by answering a question taken from
the Morningness-Eveningness question-
naire (question 19; [22]). The question
asks: “Do you consider yourself to be. . .”
with response options “Definitely a
‘morning’ person,” “More a ‘morning’
than ‘evening’ person,” “More an ‘even-
ing’ than a ‘morning’ person,” “Definitely
an ‘evening’ person,” “Do not know,” and
“Prefer not to answer.” Subjects who re-
sponded “Do not know” or “Prefer not to
answer” were set to missing. This single
item has been shown to correlate with
sleep timing and dim-light melatonin on-
set (23–25).
Statistical Analyses
We used age- and multivariable-adjusted
logistic regression models to estimate
ORs and 95% CI across current shift work
status (“day workers,” “shift workers,
but only rarely, if ever, night shifts,”
“irregular or rotating shifts with some
night shifts,” “irregular or rotating shifts
with usual night shifts,” and “always night
shifts”). For participants who reported on
lifetime employment, we examined asso-
ciations of cumulative night shift work
duration (none, 1–4.9, 5–9.9, and $10
years) and average monthly frequency
of night shifts (none, ,3 nights/month,
3–7 nights/month, or $8 nights/month)
with type 2 diabetes odds. Day workers
served as the reference category in all
analyses. P values for trend were calcu-
lated with continuous values of the dura-
tion, frequency, and cumulative lifetime
variables; the reported P value was based
on the Wald test.
We considered the following covari-
ates in multivariable models: age (con-
tinuous), sex (male/female), ethnicity
(European, South Asian, African-Caribbean,
and other/mixed), family history of diabe-
tes (yes/no), the Townsend Deprivation
Index (continuous [26]), BMI (continuous,
in kilograms per square meter), physical
activity (continuous, metabolic equiva-
lents [MET], and total MET-h/week),
smoking (current/past/never), alcohol
consumption (never, once/week, two to
threetimes/week, fourtosix times/week,
or daily), habitual sleep duration (contin-
uous, in hours per day), sleep apnea (yes/
no), self-reported depressive symptoms
(yes/no), hypertension status (yes/no),
antihypertensive medication use (yes/
no), elevated cholesterol levels (yes/no),
cholesterol-lowering medication use
(yes/no), and statin and steroid use
(yes/no). If covariate information was
missing, we imputed sex-specific median
values for continuous variables (i.e., BMI,
sleep duration, Townsend Deprivation In-
dex, and physical activity, all ,7% miss-
ing) or used a missing indicator approach
for categorical variables (i.e., alcohol con-
sumption and ethnicity, ,1% missing).
Model 1 was adjusted for age and sex.
We used a change in estimate approach
with forward selection for additional co-
variate selection (27), and resulting
multivariable adjusted models are pre-
sented in model 2. As BMI can also be
considered a potential mediator of the
association between shift work and
type 2 diabetes, we report BMI adjust-
ments in addition to model 2 covariates
separately in model 3.
In secondary analyses, we tested
whether chronotype modified the associ-
ation between current/lifetime shift work
and type 2 diabetes odds using a log
likelihood ratio test to compare models
with and without cross-product inter-
action terms; corresponding P values
were based on x2 statistics. We further
examined a priori–defined potential ef-
fect modification by sex (male/female),
ethnicity-specific obesity status (nonobese/
obese [28], adjusting for continuous BMI
within each stratum), weekly work hours
(,48 h/week or $48 h/week, adjusting
for continuous weekly work hours), sleep
duration (,7 h, 7 to 8 h, or .8 h), and
physical activity (median split, with addi-
tional adjustment for continuous MET-h/
week) and used the same procedure
described above to evaluate potential
interactions.
Finally, we examined whether shift
work exacerbated type 2 diabetes odds
associated with genetic predisposition
to type 2 diabetes. To do so, we first
tested whether the GRS is positively
associated with type 2 diabetes odds by
estimating OR and 95% CIs across GRS
quartiles(i.e., top and bottomquartile rep-
resent high and low genetic risk); linear
trends were examined using the GRS con-
tinuously. We then stratified initial obser-
vational shift work associations for those
currently employed and those with life-
time employment information by GRS
category and tested whether the genetic
predisposition modified the association
between current shift work, lifetime
night shift work duration, or lifetime
night shift frequency with type 2 diabe-
tes odds. We report results based on a
log likelihood ratio test comparing mod-
els with and without cross-product in-
teraction terms (using continuous GRS,
duration and frequency night shift data,
and current shift work category). We fur-
ther tested for a linear trend using the
continuous GRS within each shift work
category; the reported P value was based
on the Wald test. All genetic analyses
were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, 10 princi-
pal components of ancestry, and geno-
typing array. All analyses were repeated
for GRS10.
The a priori hypothesis was that cur-
rent and past rotating night shift work
increased type 2 diabetes odds, and all
secondary analyses were preplanned.
Analyses were conducted with R 3.1 (29)
with a two-sided significance threshold
of P , 0.05.
RESULTS
We observed 6,770 prevalent cases
of type 2 diabetes in the sample of
272,214 participants; Table 1 shows the
baseline characteristics of this analytic
sample. Overall, shift workers were youn-
ger, were more materially deprived,
worked longer hours, and were more
physically active compared with day
workers. Shift workers were also more
likely to be male, be of non-European
ancestry, have a family history of type 2
diabetes, smoke, and consume alcohol
daily. Late chronotypes were twice as
common in permanent night shift workers
than in day workers. No differences are
evident between the overall analytic sam-
ple and the sample with lifetime employ-
ment history (Supplementary Table 1);
however, the genetic sample, which is re-
stricted to participants of European de-
scent, were likely to be more physically
active (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3).
In the age- and sex-adjusted model 1,
shift workers had higher type 2 diabetes
odds than day workers, with those work-
ing irregular, rotating shifts with usual
night shifts having the highest odds

 (OR 2.10 [95% CI 1.79–2.46]) (Table 2).
The covariates retained in model 2 were
family history of type 2 diabetes, ethnic-
ity, Townsend Deprivation Index, alcohol
consumption, physical activity, hyperten-
sion, hypertension medication use, hy-
percholesterolemia, and lipid-lowering
medication intake. Type 2 diabetes odds
associated with current shift work were
attenuated by those covariates, but re-
mained significantly elevated for all shift
workers, except for permanent night shift
workers. Model 3 additionally adjusted
for BMI, and although estimates were
further attenuated, results were overall
comparable to model 2.
We then examined associations be-
tween lifetime night shift work duration
and type 2 diabetes odds (N = 70,480;
1,191 cases). Although the age- and sex-
adjusted model suggested that longer
night shift work exposure was associated
with higher type 2 diabetes odds (Ptrend ,
0.001) (Table 3), multivariable adjust-
ment attenuated this association: only
participants who worked schedules in-
cluding night shifts for ,10 years had a
significantly higher type 2 diabetes
likelihood than those who never worked
night shifts (model 2, ,5 years: OR 1.37
[95% CI 1.11–1.68]; and 5–10 years: 1.38
[1.05–1.81]), whereas those with .10
years of exposure did not (1.15 [0.95–
1.38]). Additional adjustment for BMI
further attenuated estimates, so that life-
time night shift work duration was only
associated with type 2 diabetes odds for
exposure durations of ,5 years (1.26
[1.02–1.56]).
Average lifetime night shift frequency
was associated with type 2 diabetes
odds, even after multivariable adjustment

 (Ptrend = 0.001) (Table 4). Participants
who, on average, worked more than eight
night shifts per month had a significant
36% higher likelihood of type 2 diabetes
compared with participants who never
worked night shifts. Again, BMI adjust-
mentattenuatedtheassociation,butover-
all patterns remained similar.
Stratified analyses by sex, chronotype,
and obesity status were not suggestive
of a differential association between cur-
rent shift work and type 2 diabetes odds
as a function of sex (Pinteraction = 0.34)
(Supplementary Table 4), obesity status
(Pinteraction = 0.21) (Supplementary Table
5), or chronotype (Pinteraction = 0.48)
(Supplementary Table 6). We observed a
significant interaction between levels of
physical activity and current shift work
on type 2 diabetes odds (Pinteraction =
0.03) (Supplementary Table 7): compared
with day workers, individuals reporting
low physical activity levels (i.e., ,26.57
MET-h/week, median split) had a consis-
tently higher type 2 diabetes likelihood
when working any night shift schedules,
whereas individuals reporting higher
physical activity levels only had higher
type 2 diabetes odds when working shift
schedulesthat usually includenightshifts.
However, associations between fre-
quency and duration of lifetime night
shift work and type 2 diabetes odds did
not differ by chronotype (Pinteraction .
0.35), sex (Pinteraction . 0.15), obesity sta-
tus (Pinteraction . 0.15) or physical activity
(Pinteraction . 0.2). In addition, associa-
tions did not differ by current weekly
work hours or sleep duration in either
sample (all Pinteraction . 0.3).
As expected, higher genetic risk for di-
abetes was associated with a higher
type 2 diabetes likelihood (Ptrend ,
0.001). Participants at intermediate and
high genetic risk had 1.91 (1.72–2.12)
and 3.81 (3.44–4.23) higher type 2 diabe-
tes odds compared with those at low ge-
netic risk.Whenstratifyingassociationsof
current work schedule with type 2 diabe-
tes odds by genetic risk, similar patterns
were observed among day workers and
shift workers (Pinteraction = 0.26). Indepen-
dent SNP associations with type 2 diabe-
tes are presented in Supplementary Table
8. We also did not observe an interaction
between the GRS and lifetime duration
(Pinteraction = 0.42) or frequency of night
shift work (Pinteraction = 0.20).
When restricted to the 10 variants of
larger effect on type 2 diabetes (GRS10;
OR .1.2), there remained an association
between genetic risk for type 2 diabetes
with a higher likelihood of type 2 diabetes
(Ptrend , 0.001). Participants at interme-
diate andhighgeneticrisk had 1.14 (0.98–
1.3) and 1.77 (1.65–1.90) higher odds of
type 2 diabetes compared with those at
lowgenetic risk,respectively (P = 0.09 and
P , 0.001). Furthermore, no interaction
was observed between current work
schedule (Pinteraction = 0.55), lifetime dura-
tion of night shift work (Pinteraction = 0.31),
or lifetime night shifts (Pinteraction = 0.60)
with type 2 diabetes odds by GRS10.
CONCLUSIONS
In this comprehensive study of .270,000
men and women in the UK Biobank link-
ing shift work patterns to 6,770 prevalent
type 2 diabetes cases, we show that 1)
rotating night shift workers were more
likely to have type 2 diabetes than day
workers, and this association remained
significant after adjustment for BMI and
other established risk factors; 2) only
shorter durations of shift work exposure,
(i.e., ,10 years) were associated with
higher type 2 diabetes odds, as compared
with day workers, perhaps because sicker
participants (including those who devel-
oped diabetes) might quit night shift
work;3) frequency ofnight shifts matters,
as increasing average night shift fre-
quency per month was associated with
an increase in diabetes odds, also after
adjustment for risk factors and lifetime
duration of night shift work; and 4) cur-
rent and past night shift work did not in-
teract with genetic type 2 diabetes
predisposition and did not exacerbate
type 2 diabetes odds.
Our findings extend those recently re-
ported by Wyse et al. (30), who examined
the association between current shift

Shift Work, Genetic Risk, and Type 2 Diabetes
Diabetes Care Volume 41, April 2018
 work and a range of outcomes, including
BMI, type 2 diabetes, sleep, and mental
health in the UK Biobank. They reported a
7% higher likelihoodoftype2 diabetesfor
shift workers, as compared with nonshift
workers, after multivariable adjustment.
Our results show that this elevated risk is
especially related to working rotating and
irregular night shift schedules, but does
not generalize to current permanent
night shift workers in this population. Ad-
ditionally, our novel findings based on
lifetime employment reports highlight
the role of night shift frequency. That
the frequency of night shifts might be
detrimental to health has been suggested
previously by work from Hansen and
Lassen (31); their case-control study re-
ported that the total number of night
shifts worked was associated with a
higher risk of breast cancer. In line with
this observation, we showed that partic-
ipants who worked rotating schedules
with infrequent night shift had lower
type 2 diabetes risk estimates than those
with a higher proportion of night shifts. A
prospective study by Pan et al. (32) in the
Nurses’ Health Studies, in which female
nurses were regularly asked to indicate
for how long they had been working a
rotating schedule with at least three night
shifts per month, showed that longer du-
ration of rotating night shift work was
associated with higher risk for incident
type 2 diabetes and that estimates were
attenuated by BMI adjustment. We did
not observe a linear relationship between
duration of night shift work and prevalent
type 2 diabetes, potentially because of
differences in study design or because
participants in the UK Biobank might be
more prone to transition to other less
strenuous work schedules over time
(also referred to as the healthy worker
effect); our findings, however, do suggest
that the monthly frequency of night shifts
worked is key for type 2 diabetes risk.
Future shift work studies should, as rec-
ommended previously (33), systemati-
cally assess frequency of shifts when
collecting work hours information. The
healthy worker effect, and the resulting
selection of a certain work schedule,
might also berelevant forthe observation
that current permanent night shift work-
ers were not more likely to have type 2
diabetes as compared with dayworkers.
Although permanent night shift workers
were twice as likely to be late chronotypes,
a solely chronotype-based self-selection
seems to be insufficient to explain those
results, especially as a complete circa-
dian adaptation, as, for example, evi-
denced by an alignment of melatonin
rhythms with sleep/wake behavior, is
rarely achieved in this population (34).
Worth noting is that permanent night
shift workers exhibit some healthier life-
style characteristics, including lower lev-
els of alcohol intake and higher levels of
physicalactivity, than othergroups, which
might further explain our results. Further-
more, the overall prevalence of type 2 di-
abetes in the present analytic sample
(;2.5%) is lower than that in the overall
UK Biobank (4.1%) (21).
Circadian misalignment causes adverse
cardiometabolic outcomes, including
glucose intolerance (5,35–39), even in
long-time shift workers (40,41). One key
assumption in the current study is that
especially night shift work induces circa-
dian misalignment. To model individual
exposure levels of circadian misalignment
more directly, we also examined a poten-
tial interaction between chronotype and
night shift work, as it had been described
that late chronotypes suffer from less
circadian misalignment and sleep depriva-
tion when working night shifts than early
ones (9). A previous report fromthe NHSII
indeed suggested that type2diabetesrisk
was dependent on both chronotype and
rotating night shift work exposure (14).
Yet our findings are not supportive of
such an interaction. Further sensitivity
analyses restricting to women only (be-
cause in Vetter et al. [14], participants
were all female) resulted in similar overall
patterns. It is noteworthy that in the pres-
ent analyses, we used the same chrono-
type assessment method as in the NHSII
study. This single question explains the
highest fraction of variance in preferences
in sleep–wake timing (25) and is an ac-
cepted measure of chronotype. Differen-
ces in study designs, response rates, and
population characteristics are thus more
likely to contribute to the discrepancy in
findings. Further prospective studies are
needed to better understand the poten-
tial interaction between chronotype and
shift work and its effect on metabolic
health.
The meta-analysis by Gan et al. (8) of
observational studies suggested that
men were at higher type 2 diabetes
risk when working shifts than women.
However, compared with the studies in-
cluding men, those including women
were more likely to be part of studies
that adjusted for other risk factors, point-
ing toward potential overestimation
due to residual confounding in men. Our
study, which included a more homoge-
neous assessment of both exposure and
covariate information and included both
men and women, does not support the no-
tion of sex differences in the association
between shift work and type 2 diabetes
risk.
This is the first study investigating the
interaction between shift work and a cu-
mulative GRS for type 2 diabetes. Current
or past shift work did not modify genetic
type 2 diabetes risk, with no evidence of
interaction, even when restricted to ge-
netic variants with known larger genetic
risk. This could be related, at least in part,
to epistatic interaction among the genetic
variants or a healthy worker effect, as dis-
cussed earlier. It is also noteworthy that
this analysis was limited to participants of
European ancestry. Further work will be
necessary to examine the interaction of
individual genetic variants with shift work
on glucose homeostasis and risk of type 2
diabetes.
Our results, together with the existing
body of literature (e.g., Proper et al. [42]),
are in line with suggestions that both in-
tervention on body weight and work
schedules might be useful in improving
metabolic health in all individuals, inde-
pendent of their genetic type 2 diabetes
predisposition. A review of intervention
studies in shift work settings (43) con-
cluded that work schedule changes can
improve chronic disease risk factors,
and a recent pilot study eliminating night
shifts for early chronotypes and early
morning shifts for late ones improved
sleep and reduced circadian misalignment
(44).
Our study has several strengths. First, it
has a large sample size of .270,000 indi-
viduals with detailed medical history, life-
style information, and demographic
information, which was collected in a uni-
form manner. Second, case definition was
based on an extensively validated algo-
rithm (21), with up to 96% accuracy
for prevalent cases of type 2 diabetes.
Third, .70,000 participants provided
in-depth reports of shift work exposure
history, allowing the derivation of a
unique set of exposure categories. Al-
though retrospective self-reports can be
erroneous, a recent report comparing
payroll data to self-reports (45) showed
care.diabetesjournals.org
Vetter and Associates

 moderate to high levels of sensitivity and
specificity, with the exception of reports
of shift work without night shifts, which
were recalled with least accuracy (i.e.,
62% sensitivity). The lifetime reports
used in this study are likely to be more
prone to error, as they cover a whole
lifetime of employment. It is noteworthy
that the potential exposure misclassifi-
cation resulting from such errors would
bias toward to the null and thus result in
an underestimation of the association
between shift work and type 2 diabetes.
Fourth, our investigation uniquely linked
genetic and observational data in a large
population with detailed lifetime em-
ployment history. Finally, the detailed
shift work history collected in the UK
Biobank provides novel and unique in-
sights into what are likely to be the most
critical aspects of work schedules in rela-
tion to health and thereby provides in-
valuable guidance for future studies and
the design of prevention strategies.
We also acknowledge some weak-
nesses of our study. First, we could not
assess links between shift work and
incident type 2 diabetes for which supple-
mentary primary care data are necessary.
Second, a general weakness of observa-
tional datasets is a risk of bias due to re-
sidual confounding; yet, we minimized
confounding through high-resolution co-
variate adjustment considering an ex-
tensive list of continuous rather than
categorical variables whenever possible.
Risk factors that we did not account
for were dietary composition and meal
timing. Only a subset of participants an-
swered a validated 24-h diet recall, which
included questions on the consumption
of ;200 commonly consumed items
(46). When we restricted our analyses to
this subsample (N = 109,696) and addi-
tionally accounted for caloric, carbohy-
drate, fat, and protein intake in our
analyses, results did not change, sug-
gesting that, at least in this subgroup
of currently employed individuals, die-
tary intake did not additionally con-
found the association between shift
work and type 2 diabetes odds. Infor-
mation on food timing was not avail-
able in the UK Biobank and might be
of critical importance in glucose control
and metabolic health, especially in shift
workers (5,47). Third, the cross-sectional
nature of our study represents a weak-
ness because it prevents any assessment
of causality. However, the current results
are consistent with controlled experimen-
tal studies showing that misalignment be-
tween the circadian system and the
sleep/wake and fasting cycles, as is typical
in shift workers, causes relative impair-
ment of glucose tolerance and insulin
sensitivity (35–37,39,42), even in chronic
shift workers (40,41). Finally, UK Biobank
participation rates were low at ;5%,
which might have introduced selection
bias. This is supported by the lower prev-
alence of type 2 diabetes in the overall
UK Biobank sample (4.1%) compared
with the general U.K. population of
the same age-group (48). Low response
rate is also of concern in relation to shift
work studies, as work hours might hin-
der daytime recruitment at assessment
centers.
Overall, our results add to the current
body of literature in that they suggest
that reducing night shift work frequency
might represent another avenue to im-
prove metabolic health during working
life and beyond. A more detailed assess-
ment of shift schedules should thus be
incorporated in occupational health and
preventive medicine settings as well as in
ongoing and novel studies of modifiable
risk factors of health and disease.
