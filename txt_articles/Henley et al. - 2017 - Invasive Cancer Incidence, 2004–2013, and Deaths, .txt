Abstract
Problem/Condition: Previous reports have shown that persons living in nonmetropolitan (rural or urban) areas in the United 
States have higher death rates from all cancers combined than persons living in metropolitan areas. Disparities might vary by cancer 
type and between occurrence and death from the disease. This report provides a comprehensive assessment of cancer incidence 
and deaths by cancer type in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan counties.
Reporting Period: 2004–2015.
Description of System: Cancer incidence data from CDC’s National Program of Cancer Registries and the National Cancer 
Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program were used to calculate average annual age-adjusted incidence 
rates for 2009–2013 and trends in annual age-adjusted incidence rates for 2004–2013. Cancer mortality data from the National 
Vital Statistics System were used to calculate average annual age-adjusted death rates for 2011–2015 and trends in annual age-
adjusted death rates for 2006–2015. For 5-year average annual rates, counties were classified into four categories (nonmetropolitan 
rural, nonmetropolitan urban, metropolitan with population <1 million, and metropolitan with population ≥1 million). For the 
trend analysis, which used annual rates, these categories were combined into two categories (nonmetropolitan and metropolitan). 
Rates by county classification were examined by sex, age, race/ethnicity, U.S. census region, and cancer site. Trends in rates were 
examined by county classification and cancer site.
Results: During the most recent 5-year period for which data were available, nonmetropolitan rural areas had lower average annual 
age-adjusted cancer incidence rates for all anatomic cancer sites combined but higher death rates than metropolitan areas. During 
2006–2015, the annual age-adjusted death rates for all cancer sites combined decreased at a slower pace in nonmetropolitan 
areas (-1.0% per year) than in metropolitan areas (-1.6% per year), increasing the differences in these rates. In contrast, annual 
age-adjusted incidence rates for all cancer sites combined decreased approximately 1% per year during 2004–2013 both in 
nonmetropolitan and metropolitan counties.
Interpretation: This report provides the first comprehensive description of cancer incidence and mortality in nonmetropolitan and 
metropolitan counties in the United States. Nonmetropolitan rural counties had higher incidence of and deaths from several cancers 
related to tobacco use and cancers that can be prevented by screening. Differences between nonmetropolitan and metropolitan 
counties in cancer incidence might reflect differences in risk factors such as cigarette smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity, 
whereas differences in cancer death rates might reflect disparities in access to health care and timely diagnosis and treatment.
Public Health Action: Many cancer cases and deaths could be prevented, and public health programs can use evidence-based 
strategies from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) to support 
cancer prevention and control. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends population-based screening for colorectal, 
female breast, and cervical cancers among adults at average risk for these cancers and for lung cancer among adults at high risk; 
screening adults for tobacco use and excessive alcohol use, offering counseling and interventions as needed; and using low-dose 
aspirin to prevent colorectal cancer among adults considered to be at high risk for cardiovascular disease based on specific criteria. 
ACIP recommends vaccination against cancer-related infectious diseases including human papillomavirus and hepatitis B virus. 
The Guide to Community Preventive Services  describes program 
and policy interventions proven to increase cancer screening and 
vaccination rates and to prevent tobacco use, excessive alcohol use, 
obesity, and physical inactivity.

Introduction
Cancer rates vary by many different characteristics, including 
geographic classifications such as county of residence. 
County populations differ from one another on the basis 
of demographic, environmental, economic, and social 
characteristics, which might influence the magnitude and 
types of health problems, including cancer (1). Counties can 
be classified as metropolitan or nonmetropolitan as defined by 
the Office of Management and Budget (2). This classification 
scheme can be further categorized by using the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service (USDA 
ERS) rural-urban continuum codes classification scheme, 
which categorizes metropolitan counties by the population size 
of their metropolitan area and nonmetropolitan counties by 
degree of urbanization and adjacency to a metropolitan area 
(3). Previous research indicates that although cancer death rates 
decreased from 1999 to 2014 among all counties, decreases 
were slower in nonmetropolitan areas than metropolitan areas, 
increasing disparities (1). Comparisons of cancer death rates 
in nonmetropolitan areas and metropolitan areas have been 
described previously but not systematically assessed (1,4).
The Healthy People 2020 initiative established a set of 
goals and objectives designed to improve the health of the 
U.S. population, recognizing the important role played by 
determinants of health, such as geographic location (5). As of 
2017, Healthy People 2020 includes objectives for reducing age-
adjusted overall cancer death rates to 161.4 deaths per 100,000 
persons, lung cancer to 45.5 deaths per 100,000 persons, 
female breast cancer to 20.7 deaths per 100,000 females, 
cervical cancer to 2.2 deaths per 100,000 females, colorectal 
cancer to 14.5 deaths per 100,000 persons, oral cavity and 
pharynx cancer to 2.3 deaths per 100,000 persons, prostate 
cancer to 21.8 deaths per 100,000 males, and melanoma to 
2.4 deaths per 100,000 persons (5). Healthy People 2020 also 
includes objectives to reduce age-adjusted incidence rates of 
colorectal cancer to 39.9 cases per 100,000 persons, late-stage 
breast cancer to 42.2 cases per 100,000 females, and cervical 
cancer to 7.3 cases per 100,000 females (5).
This report assesses differences in cancer incidence and death 
rates by county classification, age group, sex, race/ethnicity, 
U.S. census region, and cancer type (and stage for incidence 
of cancers that are detectable by screening), as well as changes 
over time in incidence and death rates for common cancers in 
nonmetropolitan and metropolitan counties and whether these 
trends differ. In addition, this report assesses progress toward 
reaching the Healthy People 2020 objectives for cancer (5). 
These findings can be used by public health officials to identify 
areas with the highest rates of cancer incidence or mortality and 
focus on regions that might benefit from strategies to prevent 
cancer from occurring or to reduce deaths from cancer. 
Methods
To examine differences in cancer incidence and mortality 
in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan counties in the United 
States, CDC analyzed cancer incidence data from CDC’s 
National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and the 
National Cancer Institute’s (NCI’s) Surveillance, Epidemiology, 
and End Results (SEER) program and cancer mortality data 
from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) (6,7). The 
most recent data available are through 2013 for incidence 
and through 2015 for deaths. This report presents average 
annual age-adjusted rates for the most recent 5-year period 
with available data (2009–2013 for incidence and 2011–2015 
for deaths) and trends in annual age-adjusted incidence 
rates for the most recent 10-year period with available data 
(2004–2013 for incidence and 2006–2015 for deaths). For 
5-year average annual rates, counties were classified into four 
categories (nonmetropolitan rural, nonmetropolitan urban, 
metropolitan with population <1 million, and metropolitan 
with population ≥1 million). For the trend analysis, which 
used annual rates, these categories were combined into two 
categories (nonmetropolitan and metropolitan).
Incidence Data
Data on new cases of cancer diagnosed during 2004–2013 
were obtained from population-based cancer registries affiliated 
with NPCR and SEER programs in each state and the District 
of Columbia. Data from Nevada did not meet U.S. Cancer 
Statistics publication criteria for 2004–2013, and county-
level data were not available for Kansas and Minnesota; 
consequently, incidence data in this report represent 97% of 
the U.S. population. Cases were classified first by anatomic 
site (https://seer.cancer.gov/siterecode), and cases with 
hematopoietic histologies were classified further (7). Only cases 
of invasive cancer were included, except for urinary bladder 
cancer, for which in situ tumors also were included. Cancers 
for which population-based screening recommendations 
exist (breast, cervix, colon and rectum, and lung) also were 
characterized by stage at diagnosis; SEER Summary Stage 
2000 was used to characterize cancers as localized, regional, 
distant, or unknown stage using clinical and pathologic tumor 
characteristics, such as tumor size, depth of invasion and 
extension to regional or distant tissues, involvement of regional 
lymph nodes, and distant metastases (https://seer.cancer.gov/
tools/ssm). Late-stage cancers included those diagnosed at the 
regional or distant stage.

Mortality Data
Data on cancer deaths were based on death certificates 
registered during 2006–2015 by the 50 states and the District 
of Columbia and compiled into a national file through NVSS. 
The underlying cause of death was based on the International 
Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes (8) and 
categorized according to SEER cancer site groups to maximize 
comparability with the International Classification of Diseases 
for Oncology, third edition (ICD-O-3) classification (https://
seer.cancer.gov/codrecode). Mortality data in this report cover 
100% of the U.S. population.
County Classification
The USDA ERS rural-urban continuum codes (2013 
vintage) were used to categorize county residence at time of 
cancer diagnosis or death as nonmetropolitan or metropolitan; 
nonmetropolitan counties were further categorized by 
degree of urbanization and adjacency to a metropolitan area 
and metropolitan counties by the population size of their 
metropolitan area (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/
rural-urban-continuum-codes). Thus, counties were more 
specifically classified as nonmetropolitan rural (rural-urban 
continuum codes 8 and 9) or nonmetropolitan urban (rural-
urban continuum codes 4–7), and metropolitan counties 
were classified as metropolitan with <1 million population 
(rural-urban continuum codes 2 and 3) or metropolitan with 
≥1 million population (rural-urban continuum code 1). The 
two-category classification was used for the trend analysis, 
which used annual rates; the rate analysis, which used 5-year 
average annual rates, allowed for the more detailed four-
category classification.
Demographic and Tumor Characteristics
Information about race/ethnicity was collected separately 
and was based on medical records or death certificates. In 
this report, information about race/ethnicity was combined 
to create five mutually exclusive groups: non-Hispanic white, 
non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska 
Native (AI/AN), non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander (API), 
and Hispanic. Cases among persons with other or unknown 
race (2%) or unknown ethnicity (2%) were included in overall 
rates but were not included as separate categories.
Individual cancer sites included the most common cancers 
among men and among women in each of the five racial/ethnic 
groups. These sites include prostate; female breast; lung and 
bronchus (lung); colon and rectum (colorectal); oral cavity 
and pharynx; esophagus; stomach; liver and intrahepatic bile 
duct (liver); pancreas; larynx; corpus uteri and uterus, not 
otherwise specified (uterus); uterine cervix (cervix); ovary; 
kidney and renal pelvis (kidney); urinary bladder (bladder); 
thyroid; melanoma; brain and other central nervous system 
(brain); non-Hodgkin lymphoma; myeloma; and leukemia.
Statistical Analysis
Population estimates for rate denominators were a 
modification of annual county population estimates by age, 
sex, bridged race, and ethnicity produced by the U.S. Census 
Bureau in collaboration with CDC and with support from 
NCI (https://seer.cancer.gov/popdata). The 5-year average 
annual incidence rates for 2009–2013 and 5-year average 
annual death rates for 2011–2015 per 100,000 persons 
were age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population. 
Rates were estimated by nonmetropolitan (urban and rural) 
and metropolitan residence (population size <1 million and 
≥1 million), sex, age group (<20, 20–44, 45–64, 65–74, 
and ≥75 years), racial/ethnic group, U.S. census region, and 
cancer site. Rate ratios were calculated to compare incidence 
and death rates in nonmetropolitan rural counties with rates 
in other counties; rates were considered significantly different 
(p<0.05) if the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the rate 
ratio excluded one. The average annual percentage change 
(AAPC) was used to quantify changes in annual age-adjusted 
incidence rates during 2004–2013 and annual age-adjusted 
death rates during 2006–2015 and was calculated using 
joinpoint regression, which allowed different slopes for two 
periods; the year at which slopes changed could vary by county 
classification (https://surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint). To 
determine whether AAPC was significantly different from 
zero, a t-test was used for 0 joinpoints, and a z-test was used 
for 1 joinpoint. Rates were considered to increase if AAPC 
>0 (p<0.05) and to decrease if AAPC <0 (p<0.05); otherwise 
rates were considered stable. Differences in AAPCs between 
nonmetropolitan and metropolitan counties were considered 
significant (p<0.05) if the 95% CI for the difference excluded 
zero. All statistical tests were two sided. 
Results
Cancer Incidence Rates and Trends
Cancer cases in nonmetropolitan rural counties comprised 2% 
of all cancers in this analysis, cancer cases in nonmetropolitan 
urban counties comprised 15%, and cases in all metropolitan 
counties accounted for 83% (Table 1). The average annual 
age-adjusted incidence rate (incidence rate) for all anatomic 
cancer sites combined was lower among nonmetropolitan rural 
counties (442 cases per 100,000 persons) than rates among 
 Surveillance Summaries

nonmetropolitan urban counties (455 cases per 100,000 
persons), metropolitan counties with <1 million population 
(456 cases per 100,000 persons), and metropolitan counties 
with ≥1 million population (457 cases per 100,000 persons). 
Overall cancer incidence rates among men and among women 
were lower among nonmetropolitan rural counties than in 
other counties. By age, overall cancer incidence rates among 
nonmetropolitan rural counties were similar to those in other 
counties among those aged <45 years but lower among those 
aged ≥45 years. Among non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic 
blacks, and Hispanics, overall cancer incidence rates were 
lower in nonmetropolitan rural counties than in other 
counties; however, among AI/ANs, the highest rates were in 
nonmetropolitan rural counties. Overall cancer incidence rates 
among APIs did not differ by county classification.
Although many differences in cancer site between 
nonmetropolitan rural and urban counties were not significant, 
nonmetropolitan rural counties generally experienced lower 
incidence rates than metropolitan counties for female breast 
cancer, late-stage female breast cancer, and prostate cancer 
but higher incidence rates for lung cancer, late-stage lung 
cancer, colorectal cancer, late-stage colorectal cancer, and 
cervical cancer (Figure 1). Nonmetropolitan rural counties 
experienced lower incidence rates than all other counties for 
cancers of the stomach, liver, uterus, bladder, and thyroid 
and lower incidence rates than metropolitan counties (but 
similar to nonmetropolitan urban counties) for pancreatic 
cancer, myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and other cancers; 
higher incidence rates than metropolitan counties for laryngeal 
cancer; higher incidence rates than metropolitan counties with 
population ≥1 million population for cancers of the oral cavity 
and pharynx, esophagus, and kidney and for melanoma; and 
rates similar to those of other counties for brain cancer and 
leukemia (Table 1). 
During 2004–2013, overall cancer incidence rates decreased 
similarly in nonmetropolitan counties (-0.8% per year) and in 
metropolitan counties and (-1% per year) (Figure 2). Although 
overall breast cancer incidence rates were stable, late-stage 
breast cancer incidence rates decreased 0.7% per year both 
in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan counties (Figure 2). 
Incidence rates for cervical and prostate cancers decreased at 
similar rates in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan counties, 
whereas incidence rates for cancer of the colon and rectum 
(all and late-stage) and lung cancer (all and late-stage), which 
were already higher in nonmetropolitan counties, decreased 
more slowly than in metropolitan counties, increasing existing 
disparities (Figure 2). Some cancer incidence rates decreased 
at similar rates in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan counties 
(ovarian and brain cancers and non-Hodgkin lymphoma), 
whereas some decreased more slowly in nonmetropolitan 
counties (esophageal and laryngeal cancer) (supplemental 
Table 1 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/45451). Incidence rates 
for myeloma, melanoma, and cancers of the pancreas, kidney, 
and thyroid increased at similar rates in nonmetropolitan and 
metropolitan counties; rates for cancers of the oral cavity and 
pharynx and liver increased more quickly in nonmetropolitan 
counties; and rates for uterine cancer increased more quickly 
in metropolitan counties (supplemental Table 1 https://stacks.
cdc.gov/view/cdc/45451). Bladder cancer incidence rates 
increased 1.1% per year in metropolitan counties but decreased 
0.5% per year in nonmetropolitan counties (supplemental 
Table 1 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/45451).
Cancer Death Rates and Trends
An average of 48,194 cancer deaths occurred each year 
during 2011–2015 in nonmetropolitan rural counties, 
representing 8% of all cancer deaths reported in the 
United States (Table 2). The average annual age-adjusted 
death rate (death rate) for all cancer sites combined was 
higher in nonmetropolitan rural counties (180 deaths per 
100,000 persons) than in nonmetropolitan urban counties 
(177 deaths per 100,000 persons), metropolitan counties 
with <1 million population (166 deaths per 100,000 persons), 
and metropolitan counties with ≥1 million population (158 
deaths per 100,000 persons). By sex, overall cancer death rates 
among both men and women were higher in nonmetropolitan 
rural counties than in other counties. By age, overall cancer 
death rates in nonmetropolitan rural counties were generally 
similar to those in other counties among those aged <20 years 
but higher among those aged ≥20 years. Overall cancer death 
rates were higher in nonmetropolitan rural counties than 
in other counties among non-Hispanic whites and AI/ANs 
but lower among Hispanics and APIs; among non-Hispanic 
blacks, rates in nonmetropolitan rural counties were lower 
than in nonmetropolitan urban counties but higher than in 
metropolitan counties.
By cancer site, nonmetropolitan rural counties experienced 
higher death rates than all other counties for cancers of the 
lung, colon and rectum, prostate, and cervix; for female 
breast cancer, death rates were higher than in metropolitan 
counties with <1 million population but similar to rates of 
other counties (Figure 1). In addition, compared with all 
other counties, nonmetropolitan rural counties experienced 
higher death rates from cancers of the oral cavity and 
pharynx and kidney (Table 2). Death rates for cancers of the 
esophagus, larynx, and bladder, melanoma, and leukemia 
in nonmetropolitan rural counties were similar to those 
in nonmetropolitan urban counties but higher than in 
metropolitan counties, whereas death rates for cancers of the

ovary and brain were higher than in metropolitan counties 
with ≥1 million population and similar to rates of other 
counties. Death rates in nonmetropolitan rural counties were 
lower than all other counties for liver cancer, lower than in 
metropolitan counties for stomach cancer, and lower than in 
metropolitan counties with ≥1 million population for uterine 
cancer, whereas death rates for non-Hodgkin lymphoma were 
lower than in nonmetropolitan urban counties but higher than 
in metropolitan counties. Death rates for pancreatic cancer 
and myeloma were similar in nonmetropolitan rural counties 
compared with all other counties. 
During 2006–2015, death rates for all cancer sites combined 
decreased more slowly in nonmetropolitan counties (-1.0% per 
year) than in metropolitan counties (-1.6% per year), widening 
differences in rates (Figure 3). Similarly, differences in death 
rates also increased for lung and colorectal cancers because rates 
decreased more slowly in nonmetropolitan counties. Although 
breast cancer death rates had been lower in nonmetropolitan 
counties, they decreased more slowly than in metropolitan 
counties, resulting in similar rates. Cervical cancer death rates 
were stable in nonmetropolitan counties but decreased slightly 
in metropolitan counties. Death rates for prostate, stomach, 
and ovarian cancers; non-Hodgkin lymphoma; and leukemia 
decreased in nonmetropolitan counties at the same rate as 
in metropolitan counties but decreased more slowly than in 
metropolitan counties for laryngeal cancer (supplemental 
Table 2 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/45451). Death 
rates for melanoma and for cancers of the esophagus and 
kidney decreased in metropolitan counties but were stable in 
nonmetropolitan counties (supplemental Table 2 https://stacks.
cdc.gov/view/cdc/45451). Death rates for thyroid cancer, oral 
cavity and pharyngeal cancer, and myeloma were stable both 
in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan counties (supplemental 
Table 2 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/45451). Death rates 
increased at about the same rate in nonmetropolitan and 
metropolitan counties for uterine and brain cancers but 
increased faster in nonmetropolitan counties for liver cancer 
(supplemental Table 2 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/45451). 
Pancreatic cancer death rates increased in nonmetropolitan 
counties but were stable in metropolitan counties, whereas 
bladder cancer death rates increased in nonmetropolitan 
counties but decreased in metropolitan counties (supplemental 
Table 2 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/45451).
Discussion
During the most recent 5-year period with available data, 
nonmetropolitan rural counties had lower average annual 
age-adjusted incidence rates (2009–2013) for all cancer 
sites combined, but higher average annual age-adjusted 
death rates (2011–2015) for all cancer sites combined, than 
nonmetropolitan urban and metropolitan counties. During 
the most recent 10-year period with available data (2004–
2013), the annual age-adjusted overall cancer incidence rates 
decreased equally, by approximately 1% per year, both in 
nonmetropolitan and metropolitan counties; however, the 
annual age-adjusted overall cancer death rates (2006–2015) 
decreased more slowly in nonmetropolitan counties (-1.0% 
per year) than in metropolitan counties (-1.6% per year), 
increasing existing differences in rates.
Nonmetropolitan rural counties had higher incidence 
and death rates for cancers related to smoking (e.g., lung 
and laryngeal cancers) and cancers that can be prevented 
by screening (i.e., colorectal and cervical cancers). Rates for 
these cancers also decreased more slowly in nonmetropolitan 
counties than in metropolitan counties, increasing disparities. 
Nonmetropolitan rural counties also had higher incidence rates 
of cancers related to human papillomavirus (HPV) (cancers 
of the cervix, oral cavity and pharynx) but lower incidence 
rates of cancers related to other infectious agents such as liver 
(which can be caused by hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus) 
and stomach cancer (which can be caused by infection with 
Helicobacter pylori bacteria). Compared with metropolitan 
counties, nonmetropolitan counties had lower incidence rates 
for breast and prostate cancer that persisted over time but had 
similar breast cancer death rates and slightly higher prostate 
cancer death rates.
Risk Factor Prevalence
Many cancers are caused by modifiable risk factors, such 
as cigarette smoking and other tobacco use, secondhand 
smoke exposure, excess body weight, insufficient physical 
activity, alcohol use, excessive exposure to ultraviolet rays 
from the sun and tanning beds, and exposure to cancer-
causing infectious agents (9). Differences in risk factors such 
as cigarette smoking could account for some of the disparities 
presented in this report. Previous research has shown that 
residents of nonmetropolitan areas, compared with residents 
of metropolitan areas, have higher rates of cancer risk factors 
such as cigarette smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity (4). 
Results from the 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance 
System indicated that adults who lived in rural areas, compared 
with those who lived in nonrural areas, had the lowest 
prevalence (27%) of reporting at least four of five healthy 
behaviors defined as current nonsmoking, maintaining normal 
body weight, nondrinking or moderate drinking, meeting 
aerobic leisure-time physical activity recommendations, and 
getting enough sleep (10). Many of these healthy behaviors are

* Trends were measured with AAPC in annual rates (per 100,000, age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population) calculated using joinpoint regression, which 
allowed different slopes for two periods; the year at which slopes changed could vary by county classification. To determine whether AAPC was significantly different 
from zero, a t-test was used for 0 joinpoints, and a z-test was used  for 1 joinpoint. Rates were considered to increase if AAPC >0 (p<0.05) and to decrease if AAPC <0 
(p<0.05); otherwise rates were considered stable. All AAPCs were significantly different (p<0.05) from zero unless otherwise indicated (by NS).
† Cancer incidence data were compiled from cancer registries that meet the data quality criteria for all invasive cancer sites combined, representing approximately 
97% of the U.S. population. (Data from Nevada did not meet U.S. Cancer Statistics publication criteria for 2004–2013, and county-level data were not available for 
Kansas and Minnesota.) Late-stage cancers include those diagnosed at the regional or distant stage, after the cancer has spread.
§ Nonmetropolitan and metropolitan counties were identified using the U.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service 2013 vintage rural-urban continuum 
code (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-continuum-codes). AAPCs differed significantly between nonmetropolitan and metropolitan counties 
for cancers of the lung and colon and rectum but did not differ for cancers of all sites, female breast, prostate, or cervix.

associated with a reduced risk for cancer (9). By risk factor, the 
study found that adults who lived in rural areas had the lowest 
prevalence of current nonsmoking (i.e., the highest prevalence 
of current smoking), maintaining normal body weight (i.e., the 
highest prevalence of being overweight or obese), and meeting 
aerobic leisure-time physical activity recommendations (i.e., 
the highest prevalence of not getting enough physical activity), 
each of which is associated with increased cancer risk but the 
highest prevalence of nondrinking or moderate drinking, which 
could be associated with reduced cancer risk (10).
Certain cancer risk factors can be addressed through 
clinical preventive services. As of 2017, the U.S. Preventive 
Services Task Force has recommended that all adults be 
screened for tobacco use and excessive alcohol use and offered 
counseling and intervention as needed and recommended 
the use of low-dose aspirin to prevent colorectal cancer and 
cardiovascular disease among adults who are considered to 
be at high risk for cardiovascular disease based on specific 
criteria (https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/
Name/recommendations). A higher percentage of residents in 
nonmetropolitan areas than in metropolitan areas was uninsured 
(11), potentially limiting access to preventive services covered 
by insurance. The Advisory Committee on Immunization 
Practices recommends vaccination against two cancer-causing 
viruses, HPV (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/
vacc-specific/hpv.html) and hepatitis B virus (https://www.
cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hepb.html). 
Data from the 2014 National Immunization Survey among 
persons aged 13–17 years indicate that vaccination rates for 
hepatitis B were similar in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan 
counties but that the vaccination rates for HPV among both 
boys and girls were lower in nonmetropolitan counties than 
in metropolitan counties (11).
In addition, disparities could be attributed to differences 
in adherence to screening guidelines. As of 2017, the U.S. 
Preventive Services Task Force has recommended population-
based screening for colorectal, female breast, and cervical cancers 
among persons at average risk and for lung cancer in persons at 
high risk (https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/
Name/recommendations). Cancer screening is an important 
aspect of cancer prevention and control because screening can 
prevent cancer by finding and treating precancerous changes 
before they progress to cancer, and screening can control 
cancer by detecting tumors at the earliest stages when they 
are most treatable. Cervical and colorectal cancer screening 
tests can detect both precancerous lesions and cancer at an 
early stage, thus preventing both cancer occurrence and cancer 
death; breast and lung cancer screening tests can detect cancer 
at an early stage, thus reducing cancer deaths, although they 
do not prevent cancer from developing. Data from the 2010 
National Health Interview Survey indicated that rates of breast 
and cervical cancer screening were similar in metropolitan 
and nonmetropolitan counties but that colorectal cancer 
screening rates were lower in nonmetropolitan counties (12). 
Increased use of cancer screening might reduce rates of late-
stage cancer; data from this report indicate that, compared with 
metropolitan counties, nonmetropolitan counties generally had 
higher rates of and slower decreases in late-stage lung cancer 
and late-stage colorectal cancer but similar rates of late-stage 
cervical cancer and lower rates of late-stage breast cancer. The 
data in this report also indicate that nonmetropolitan counties 
experienced higher death rates from colorectal and cervical 
cancer. Higher death rates might reflect lack of access to cancer 
screening services, follow-up to abnormal tests, quality care for 
cancer patients, and cancer survival care (4).
Evidence-Based Interventions
An important component of cancer prevention and control is 
implementation of interventions at both the individual level and 
the population level (13). Interventions can be implemented to 
reduce cancer risk factors, particularly tobacco use, secondhand 
smoke exposure, alcohol use, and excessive exposure to 
ultraviolet rays from the sun and tanning beds, and to promote 
protective factors such as vaccination against cancer-related 
infectious diseases including HPV and hepatitis B virus, getting 
enough physical activity, and maintaining a healthy weight. 
Program and policy interventions proven to increase cancer 
screening and vaccination rates and to prevent tobacco use, 
excessive alcohol use, obesity, and physical inactivity have been 
reviewed and evaluated in The Guide to Community Preventive 
Services (https://www.thecommunityguide.org). The CDC’s 
National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program brings 
together diverse partners to plan, implement, and evaluate 
these interventions in their own communities (https://www.
cdc.gov/cancer/ncccp).
CDC also supports the National Breast and Cervical 
Cancer Early Detection Program, which addresses health 
disparities among women who are uninsured or underinsured, 
a common characteristic in rural populations (https://www.
cdc.gov/cancer/nbccedp). Although this program has focused 
on direct screening services, emphasis is shifting toward 
population-based interventions, similar to those used by the 
Colorectal Cancer Control Program (https://www.cdc.gov/
cancer/crccp). The goal is to work with health care systems, 
health care payers, health care purchasers, and other partners to 
implement interventions that address barriers such as providing 
transportation assistance, having clinics with modified hours, 
and providing assessment and feedback reports on clinical 
practice performance. Communities with lower screening

rates or higher incidence of and mortality from cancer might 
particularly benefit from these interventions.
CDC’s National Tobacco Control Program promotes 
ongoing work to reduce tobacco use through support to state 
and territorial health departments (https://www.cdc.gov/
tobacco/stateandcommunity/tobacco_control_programs/
ntcp/index.htm). Compared with urban and metropolitan 
populations, residents of rural areas have a higher smoking 
prevalence, start smoking at a younger age, smoke more 
heavily, use smokeless tobacco at twice the rate, and are more 
likely to be exposed to secondhand smoke (14). Evidence-
based strategies to reduce tobacco-related disparities include 
increasing the number of persons covered by comprehensive 
smoke-free laws; increasing the price of tobacco products; 
reducing exposure to targeted tobacco industry advertising, 
promotions, and sponsorship; and improving the availability 
and accessibility of cessation services (14).
Healthy People 2020
Many of the Healthy People 2020 objectives for cancer 
mortality (all sites, lung, colorectal, cervical, prostate, 
oral cavity and pharyngeal, and melanoma) were met in 
metropolitan counties with ≥1 million population; however, 
only one (prostate cancer) was met in nonmetropolitan rural 
and urban counties. Regarding objectives for incidence, the 
objective for colorectal cancer was met in metropolitan counties 
with <1 million population, and the objective for late-stage 
breast cancer incidence was met in nonmetropolitan rural and 
urban counties. Because late-stage incidence rates correspond 
with overall incidence rates, the lower rate of late-stage breast 
cancer incidence in nonmetropolitan counties likely reflects a 
lower baseline breast cancer incidence rather than a difference 
in late-stage diagnoses. These disparities indicate that not all 
persons are benefitting equally from initiatives to achieve 
Healthy People 2020 objectives and that more work is needed 
to meet these objectives. Furthermore, using an overall rate, 
which largely reflects the experience of the heavily populated 
metropolitan counties, might mask underlying disparities by 
geographic region such as those highlighted in this report.
Limitations
The findings in this report are subject to at least five 
limitations. First, delays in cancer reporting might result in 
an underestimation of certain cancers; reporting delays are 
more common for cancers such as melanoma and prostate 
cancer that are diagnosed and treated in nonhospital settings 
such as physicians’ offices. Second, incidence was not 
classifiable by county classification for all states; therefore, 
these results might not apply to states excluded from the 
analyses. Third, differences in rates and trends might be 
statistically, but not clinically, significant. Fourth, analyses of 
trends should be carefully interpreted; certain rates might be 
actually increasing or decreasing even though the trend is not 
statistically significant. Finally, this report used the most recent 
data available, through 2013 for incidence data and 2015 
for mortality data; caution should be used when comparing 
incidence and death rates because of the difference in years 
and population coverage.
Future Directions
This report demonstrates the value of examining cancer 
incidence and death rates among nonmetropolitan and 
metropolitan area by cancer type. Examination of county-level 
patterns within states might be helpful in determining areas with 
disproportionately high cancer incidence or death rates. Using 
tools such as State Cancer Profiles (https://statecancerprofiles.
cancer.gov) might help identify prevalence of risk factors and 
use of screening tests that might affect these rates.
Conclusion
Although nonmetropolitan rural counties had a lower 
incidence of cancer overall, the incidence of certain cancers, 
including lung cancer, was higher, as was overall cancer 
mortality. Many cancers are linked to modifiable risk factors, 
such as tobacco use, and use of cancer screening tests. Evidence-
based strategies to improve health-related behaviors, use of 
vaccinations that prevent infections with cancer-causing 
viruses, and use of cancer screening tests, particularly among 
persons who live in nonmetropolitan rural and urban counties, 
might help achieve Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce 
cancer morbidity and mortality.
