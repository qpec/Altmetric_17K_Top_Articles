Background: The relationship between cholesterol and cognitive function is unclear
from the previous studies. This study was conducted to explore this association in older
Chinese adults.
Methods: Data were from the Shanghai Aging Study, comprising 3,836 residents aged
50 years or over in an urban community. Diagnoses of dementia and mild cognitive
impairment were established according to the fourth edition of diagnostic and statistical
manual of mental disorders (DSM-IV) and Petersen criteria. Multivariate logistic regression
models, non-matched and propensity score (PS) matched, were used to examine the
association between cholesterol levels and cognitive function.
Results: There was a significantly higher proportion of participants with low levels of
total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the dementia
group than in groups without dementia (P < 0.05). High LDL-C level was inversely
associated with dementia, with a negative trend in the PS matched model. TC and high
density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were not significantly related to dementia in either
non-matched models or PS matched models.
Conclusion: Our result indicates that high level of LDL-C is inversely associated with
dementia. High level of LDL-C may be considered as a potential protective factor against
cognition decline.
Keywords: low density lipoprotein cholesterol, cognitive impairment, dementia, population-based study,

INTRODUCTION
Dementia is a progressive brain disorder accompanied by a deterioration in memory and thinking,
and often with a decrease in motivation and emotional and language problems. It has physical,
mental, economic, and social effects, not only on the patients but also on their careers, their
families and society at large. Worldwide, there are over 50 million prevalent dementia cases, and
 Zhou et al.
High LDL-C Level and Dementia
nearly 10 million new cases are diagnosed per year (1). It is
estimated that the existing worldwide costs of dementia are US
$818 billion in 2017 and that it will become a trillion-dollar
disease by 2018—equivalent to the world’s 18th largest economy
(2).
The brain contains 25–30% of the total body cholesterol. As
one of the most essential components of neurons, cholesterol is of
great importance to develop and maintain neuronal plasticity and
function (3). Studies from western countries have investigated
how cholesterol levels related to cognitive impairment, but have
yielded inconsistent and conflicting results. In China, only a few
studies have investigated the relationship between cholesterol
and cognitive impairment among older community residents.
The results were varied due to different study design and target
population. A cross-sectional study with 597 participants in
southwest China has reported that low (TC) (OR = 0.94)
and (LDL-C) (OR = 0.94) were associated with mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) after adjusting for age, gender and education
(4). Another cross-sectional study involving 2,000 community
dwellings in eight longevity areas found that higher cholesterol,
including TC (OR = 0.73), LDL-C (OR = 0.82), and (HDL-C)
(OR = 0.81), was associated with better cognitive function in the
oldest old (5). Furthermore, an inversely U-shaped effect of TC
on cognition has been observed in a multicenter study with 1,889
people aged 65 years and over from four rural counties (6).
The Shanghai Aging Study is a population-based cohort study
with a design, operational procedures and diagnostic criteria
similar to most cohort studies in western countries. The study is
intending to examine the prevalence and incidence of dementia
and MCI as well as their risk and protective factors (7). We
analyzed the baseline data of this cohort to explore the association
between cholesterol levels and cognitive function among older
community dwellers in urban China.
METHODS
Study Population
Between January 2010 and December 2012, 3,836 residents aged
≥50 years were recruited from Jingansi community in central
downtown
Shanghai,
China.
Participants
were
excluded
from the study if they were (1) living in nursing homes
or other institutions; (2) experiencing mental deficiency or
severe schizophrenia, according to their medical record or
diagnoses from neurologists; or (3) having severe impairment
of hearing, vision, or verbal such that could not accomplish the
neuropsychological evaluation. Detailed recruitment procedures
were published previously (8).
This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of
Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China (approval
number: HIRB2009-195). All participants and/or their legally
acceptable representatives provided signed written informed
consent to participate this study.
Characteristics and Medical History
Demographic and lifestyle characteristics were collected via
a face-to-face questionnaire survey. Data included age, sex,
education background, and smoking habits (smoking: regular
cigarette smoking more than 1 year). Participants’ heights
and weights were measured and were used to calculate body
mass index (BMI). History of hypertension, diabetes, stroke,
and coronary artery disease was collected and confirmed with
participants’ medical records.
Laboratory Test
A 2-ml blood sample was collected from each participant by
research nurses in the morning after 12 h overnight fasting. Blood
samples were sent to the central laboratory in Huashan hospital.
Cholesterol profiles were measured from serum by Hitachi 7600
full automatic biochemical analyzer. TC was measured with
oxidase method and LDL-C and HDL-C were measured with
direct method.
Neuropsychological and Neurological
Assessments
Considering different cultural backgrounds, neuropsychological
tests from western countries were translated, adapted and
normalized for the Chinese population. Tests applied in our
study evaluated global cognition, attention, memory, language,
executive function, and spatial construction function of each
participant. The tests included: (1) the Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE); (2) the Conflicting Instructions Task
(Go/No Go Task); (3) the Stick Test; (4) the Modified Common
Objects Sorting Test; (5) the Auditory Verbal Learning Test;
(6) the Modified Fuld Object Memory Evaluation; (7) the Trail-
making test A&B; (8) the Renminbi (official currency of China)
Test, translated from the EURO test. Participants with at least 6
years of education were given tests 1 to 5 and 7, whereas those
with <6 years of education were given tests 1 to 4 and 6 and 8
(Figure 1). Normative data and more details on these tests were
reported elsewhere (8).
The motor responses and reflexes of participants were
examined by neurologists. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies
Depression and Scale (CESD) (9) was used to evaluate the
depression status of participants within the previous week and a
major depressive episode was defined as CESD ≥ 16. The Clinical
Dementia Rating (CDR) (10) and the Lawton and Brody Activity
of Daily Living (ADL) (11) were also conducted to assess the
cognitive complaints and the ability to perform activities of daily
living and physical self-maintenance.
Diagnoses of Cognitive Function
The consensus diagnosis of cognitive function was made by an
expert panel (two neurologists, one neuropsychologist, and one
neuro-epidemiologist) on the basis of all available information
for each participant, including medical, neuropsychological, and
neurological data and where possible computed tomography
(CT) and magnetic resonance images (MRI) scans. Dementia
was diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria (12). A diagnosis of
MCI, referring to Petersen’s criteria (13), was considered only for
subjects without dementia.

known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease in a variety of

ethnic groups (14), we assessed APOE genotype in our cohort.
The extraction of DNA from blood or saliva samples and the
assay of APOE genotyping through the TaqmanSNP method (15)
were conducted in the central laboratory in Huashan hospital.
APOE-ε4 positivity was defined by the occurrence of one or two
ε4 alleles.
Statistical Analysis
TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C values were divided into three levels
according to tertiles (5): low TC level, <4.87 mmol/L; moderate
TC level, 4.87–5.72 mmol/L; high TC level, >5.72 mmol/L;
low LDL-C level, <2.9 mmol/L; moderate LDL-C level, 2.9–3.7
mmol/L; high LDL-C level, >3.7 mmol/L; low HDL-C level,
<1.17 mmol/L; moderate HDL-C level, 1.17–1.45 mmol/L; and
high HDL-C level, >1.45 mmol/L. Differences in characteristics
among groups with different cognition status (normal, MCI,
or dementia) were evaluated with Kruskal–Wallis test for
continuous variables and Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel statistics
for categorical variables (16, 17).
Multivariate
logistic
regression
models
(non-matched
models)
were
used
to
examine
the
association
between
cholesterol levels and cognition status (MCI or dementia
compared with normal). TC, LDL-C, and HDL levels were
included in the logistic model as dummy variables, with the
low level group used as the reference to estimate the odds ratio
(OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), and with adjustment for
covariates such as age, sex, years of education, BMI, depression,
diabetes, stroke, hypertension, and APOE-ε4 genotype.
PS methods are being used to reduce the impact of treatment
selection bias in the estimation of causal treatment effects using
observational data (18). They also can be used to estimate
the relationship between any non-randomized factors (19). The
PS is the estimated conditional probability of assignment to a
particular “treatment” given a series of vector covariates (20). In
our study, PS matching was applied to reduce the bias due to non-
random exposures (cholesterol levels) and potential confounders;
the conditional probability of assignment to moderate levels
of cholesterol was chosen as the PS. Matching was conducted
in a stepwise fashion. First, we matched the PS in the low
cholesterol group with those in the moderate cholesterol group,
with 0.05 as a caliper (upper limit of the allowed difference in the
scores). Subsequently, the scores in the high cholesterol group
were matched to the effective matched pair from the first step,
and the mean difference between the high cholesterol group
and the other two groups was also not allowed to exceed 0.05.
Finally, we obtained matched subgroups with a more balanced
distribution of covariates. Multivariate logistic regression models
(PS matched models) were then performed by using the PS
matched subgroups in a sensitivity analysis, with adjustment of
the same covariates as in non-matched models.

High LDL-C Level and Dementia
All analyses were conducted by SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC, United States). P < 0.05 (two-tailed) were considered
statistically significant.
RESULTS
The full analysis set of this study comprised 3,467 participants
who had completed diagnosis of cognition and measurement
of TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C (Figure 1). As shown in Table 1,
the analyzed participants were characterized by old age (mean
[SD] = 69.4 [8.0] years old) and relatively high level of
education (mean [SD] = 11.7 [4.0] years). Among them, 86
were diagnosed as dementia and 603 were diagnosed as MCI.
The characteristics of age, education, MMSE, history of stroke,
hypertension, diabetes, depression, and APOE-ε4 allele carrier
status were significantly different among the normal, MCI, and
dementia groups.
Significant differences in the category distributions of TC and
LDL-C were found in groups with different cognition status. The
lowest proportion was found in participants with dementia who
had high level of TC (26.7%) and LDL-C (23.3%).
After adjusting for age, sex, years of education, APOE-ε4
genotype, BMI, depression, diabetes, hypertension and stroke,
the non-matched models indicated that the OR of high LDL-C
level (OR [95%CI] = 0.56[0.30, 1.04]) had an upper limit awfully
close to the null threshold. A U-shaped relationship between
HDL-C levels and ORs was found (P for trend = 0.0084) despite
of the non-significant effect of HDL-C on dementia when the
low level acted as the reference (Table 2). The effects of all the
covariates adjusted were showed in the Supplementary Material.
The inverse associations were significant between high
LDL-C level and dementia, whereas the associations between
TC or HDL-C levels and dementia remained non-significant,
according to the PS matched models (Table 2). In addition,
the effect of LDL-C was higher than that in the non-matched

model. Compared with those with low level, participants with
high level of LDL-C were less likely to have dementia (OR
[95%CI] = 0.50[0.26, 0.98]) and the OR reduced with the
increasing levels (P for trend = 0.0405).
DISCUSSION
In this community-based cross-sectional study, high level of
LDL-C was found to be inversely associated with dementia
in older Chinese adults, after controlling for demographic
characteristics, health behavior, mood assessment, and the
medical history of participants.
Our findings are consistent with those from several prior
studies. Higher LDL-C (OR [95%CI] = 0.82[0.70, 0.96]) was
reported to be significantly related with higher MMSE scores
among the oldest old (aged 80+years) in a community-based
cross-sectional study with 2,000 subjects from eight longevity
areas in China, after adjusting for age, gender, residence, marital
status, education level, current alcohol drinking habits, current
cigarette smoking practices, sleep quality, anemia, central obesity,
hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease (5). Another
cross-sectional study in South Korea did not find a significant
association between (TC) levels (non-fasting) and cognition
function in Alzheimer’s disease groups (21). Two additional
cross-sectional studies in Chinese population also reported a
non-significant relationship (6, 22). However, there are also some
studies with different findings. For example, elevated level of TC
(≥225.01 mg/dl: OR [95%CI] = 1.77 [1.03, 3.04]) was reported to
be a risk factor for vascular dementia in a cross-sectional analysis
among 2,820 Medicare recipients aged 65+ years in New York
(23). Moreover, higher LDL-C level was found to be associated
with higher amyloid deposition in a medical center-based study
with 74 elderly subjects aged 78 years on average (24).
Elevated HDL-C was found to be negatively associated with
cognitive impairment (lower HDL-C: OR [95%CI] = 1.45[1.12,
1.88]) in the Korean Urban Rural Elderly (KURE) study, which
involved 3,514 adults aged 65+ years (25). In the Maine-Syracuse
study with 540 participants aged 60+ years and without dementia
and stroke, a positive relationship between HDL-C and cognitive
performance was reported (MMSE: β = 0.195, P = 0.006)
(26). The PAQUID study, involving 334 French elderly subjects
aged 73+ years, also had a similar finding (higher HDL-C: OR
[95%CI] =0.10[0.02, 0.53]) (27). A study among 130 Australian
women with mean age of 62.5 years found a much earlier positive
effect of HDL-C (non-fasting) on verbal memory (28). Another
study in the Czech Republic, involving 141 adults (MMSE
score≥24, 69 years of age on average, 47% female, 14.4 years
of education on average) found an association between HDL-
C and better composite cognitive scores (β = 0.30, P = 0.026),
only among women (29). Our study, however, did not find a
significant association between HDL-C and cognitive status.
Although the exact biological mechanism of LDL-C’s potential
protective effect is still unknown, we conjecture that one
possibility is that high LDL-C might indicate a good nutritional
status or health condition. Lower cholesterol has been found
to be associated with a higher mortality in the elderly (30, 31),
and it may accompany malnutrition, chronic diseases and cancer
(32, 33), which in turn may positively associate with cognitive
decline (34). On the other hand, because cholesterol is a major
component of the brain, it is possible that decreasing cholesterol

levels in the elderly is associated with cerebral atrophy, a
typical anatomic syndrome of dementia (3). Another speculation
is that high LDL-C could reduce neurons’ impairments or
facilitate compensatory repair of injured neurons (35). The
inhibitions of dendrite outgrowth (36) and synaptogenesis (37),
and the acceleration of neurodegeneration (38) have been
observed when neurons was a short of cellular cholesterol
or cholesterol supply. Besides, cholesterol plays an important
role in the synthesis, transportation and metabolism of steroid
hormones as well as lipid-soluble vitamins, both of which have
an impact on synaptic integrity and neurotransmission (37,
39, 40). Apart from the reasons mentioned above, there is
another hypothesis about selective survival: participants aged
70+ are more likely to be resistant to the adverse effects of high
LDL-C or other cerebrovascular risk factors (41). For example,
oldest-old individuals were found to show more variability
in cognitive function (42) and to be less apt to age-related
cognitive decline (43). At the same time, these participants may
also be less susceptible to the benefit of high HDL-C. Further,
the protective effect of HDL-C is inconsistent. Indeed, some
genetic mechanisms raising plasma HDL-C did not lower risk of
myocardial infraction (44) and even the Tromsø study reported
that high HDL-C could increase the future risk of venous
thromboembolism in female subjects (45).
There might be a possibility of a reversal causality of lipid level
and dementia. Participants with dementia may be more likely
to have an eating disorder, be malnourished and thus probably
accompany with reduction of cholesterol level. However, the
cross-sectional study design limited our ability to explore the
causal effects. Further prospective studies are needed to provide
the evidence to the causality. The second limitation in our
study is that we could not discriminate the vascular dementia
and Alzheimer’s disease because not every participant’s MRI
was available at baseline. Third, the “snapshot” lipid profile
measurements might not be good representative of the actual
lipid levels. Fourth, compared with other studies in China,
we found that the distribution of cholesterol data and the
cut-off values of cholesterol are different with those in the
previous Chinese studies, due to the differences in demographic
characteristics, regions and socioeconomic status. To be specific,
the population of the study by Yue-Bin et al. was in rural areas
and characterized by older age (mean age = 85.8 years) and
lower education; however, our population was in a high-income
city, Shanghai, and characterized by relatively younger age (mean
age = 69.4 years), higher education and better economic status.
In this regard, the cut-off values in different studies might be less
comparable. Further multi-centered population-based studies
with larger sample size are needed to verify the U-shape curve of
lipid profile. Finally, our findings may not be largely generalizable
because our population was characterized by relatively higher
education and better economic status than those found in other
areas of China; conversely, our findings may be more comparable
with that in western studies.
CONCLUSION
Our data indicate that high level of LDL-C is inversely associated
with dementia in older Chinese adults. High level of LDL-C may
be considered as a potential protective factor against cognitive
decline. Further long-term prospective studies with a larger
sample size and accurate lipid measurement should be carried out
to verify this association and to explore underlying pathological
mechanisms.
