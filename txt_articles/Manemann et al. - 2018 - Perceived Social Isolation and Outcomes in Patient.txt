Background-—Perceived social isolation has been shown to have a negative impact on health outcomes, particularly among older
adults. However, these relationships have not been fully examined among patients with heart failure.
Methods and Results-—Residents from 11 southeast Minnesota counties with a first-ever International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code 428 for heart failure between January 1, 2013, and March 31, 2015 (N=3867), were prospectively
surveyed to measure perceived social isolation. A total of 2003 patients returned the survey (response rate, 52%); 1681 patients
completed all questions and were retained for analysis. Among these patients (53% men; mean age, 73 years), �19% (n=312) had
moderate perceived social isolation and 6% (n=108) had high perceived social isolation. After adjustment, patients reporting
moderate perceived social isolation did not have an increased risk of death, hospitalizations, or emergency department visits
compared with patients reporting low perceived social isolation; however, patients reporting high perceived social isolation had
>3.5 times increased risk of death (hazard ratio, 3.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.82–7.70), 68% increased risk of
hospitalization (hazard ratio, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.18–2.39), and 57% increased risk of emergency department visits (hazard ratio, 1.57;
95% CI, 1.09–2.27). Compared with patients who self-reported low perceived social isolation, patients reporting moderate
perceived social isolation had a 16% increased risk of outpatient visits (rate ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.03–1.31), whereas those
reporting high perceived social isolation had a 26% increased risk (rate ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.04–1.53).
Conclusions-—In patients with heart failure, greater perceived social isolation is associated with an increased risk of death and
healthcare use. Assessing perceived social isolation during the clinical encounter with a brief screening tool may help identify
patients with heart failure at greater risk of poor outcomes. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:e008069. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.117.

H
eart failure (HF) affects >6 million individuals in the
United States, and >960 000 new cases of HF are
diagnosed each year.1 The number of patients living with HF
continues to increase, and it is estimated that >8 million
Americans will have HF by the year 2030.2 HF is a major
clinical and public health problem that is associated with
significant healthcare use, poor health-related quality of life,
and poor survival.1
Identifying psychosocial factors, such as perceived social
isolation, that may contribute to poor prognosis in HF is
critical to design interventions to improve outcomes. Per-
ceived social isolation, the subjective sense of feelings of
loneliness, is associated with poor health outcomes across
the life course.3 It is distinct from objective social isolation in
that it is focused on subjective feelings of loneliness or
isolation rather than objectively quantifiable aspects of a
person’s social connectivity.4 One leading theory of loneliness
is that people who perceive themselves as lonely are also
hypervigilant for other social threats. These threats can
reduce the ability to engage in and maintain healthy
behaviors, and over time, they can impair physiological and
immunological functioning.3,5–7 As people age, therefore,
perceived social isolation, through these mechanisms, can
increase

 disturbances, and cognitive decline; social isolation can cause
overall increases in morbidity and mortality.8
Evidence on the relationship between perceived social
isolation and outcomes in patients with HF is limited.9 To
further characterize perceived social isolation and associated
outcomes among patients with HF and to assess the potential
utility of incorporating a brief screening tool for perceived
social isolation into clinical practice, we aimed to determine,
among a community cohort of patients with HF, whether
perceived social isolation, as measured by a brief screener
that could be easily incorporated into clinical practice to
identify at-risk patients, is associated with death and health-
care use, including hospitalizations, emergency department
(ED) visits, and outpatient visits.
Methods
Study Setting and Design
This study was conducted in southeast Minnesota, within the
11 counties of Dodge, Fillmore, Freeborn, Goodhue, Houston,
Mower, Olmsted, Rice, Steele, Wabasha, and Winona, incor-
porating data from Mayo Clinic, Mayo Clinic Health System
clinics and hospitals, and Olmsted Medical Center and their
affiliated clinics. Our study used the Rochester Epidemiology
Project (REP), a records linkage system that allows retrieval of
nearly all healthcare use and outcomes of residents living in
southeastern Minnesota.10,11 This region has similar age, sex,
and ethnic characteristics as the state of Minnesota and the
Upper Midwest region of the United States.11 The data,
analytic methods, and study materials will not be made
available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the
results or replicating the procedure.
Case Identification
Residents aged ≥18 years with a first-ever International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), code 428
(HF) within the REP records of the 11-county area in
southeast Minnesota between January 1, 2013, and March
31, 2015, were identified. These patients were asked to
complete a survey to measure perceived social isolation and
other sociobehavioral measures. A mixed mode design was
used that has previously proved to be successful.12 Patients
were first mailed a survey packet containing the survey, an
introductory letter, and Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 form. The survey packet was then
resent to initial nonresponders �1 month after the first
mailing.
Finally,
a
telephone
interview
was
attempted
�1 month after the second mailing for the remaining
nonresponders. Patients included in the study gave informed
consent.
Perceived Social Isolation
Perceived social isolation was measured with the Patient-
Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PRO-
MIS) Social Isolation Short Form 4a v2.0.13 This measure,
adapted from the University of California, Los Angeles,
Loneliness Scale, includes 4 items: “I feel left out,” “I feel
that people barely know me,” “I feel isolated from others,” and
“I feel that people are around me but not with me.” Each item
is scored on a 5-point scale, with the response options of
“Never,” “Rarely,” “Sometimes,” “Usually,” and “Always. Thus,
scores could range from 4 to 20, with a higher score
indicating greater perceived social isolation.
Other Patient Characteristics
Education level and marital status were obtained from the
patient survey. The Charlson Comorbidity Index score was
calculated for each patient, with comorbidities ascertained by
retrieving ICD-9 codes from inpatient and outpatient encoun-
ters at all providers in the REP.14,15 In addition, depression
was ascertained by previously published ICD-9 codes.16
Outcomes
Participants were followed up from survey completion through
December 31, 2015, for death, hospitalizations, ED visits, and
outpatient visits. Death information was obtained through the
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Perceived social isolation, the subjective sense of feelings of
loneliness or isolation, may contribute to poor prognosis in
heart failure.
• Community patients with heart failure were prospectively
surveyed to measure perceived social isolation to assess
associations with poor outcomes.
• Approximately 25% of the patients with heart failure had a
moderate or high level of perceived social isolation.
• Compared with those with low perceived social isolation,
those with moderate perceived social isolation had an
increased risk of outpatient visits; those with high perceived
social isolation had increased risks of death, hospitalization,
emergency department visits, and outpatient visits.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Assessing perceived social isolation during the clinical
encounter with a brief screening tool may help identify
patients with heart failure who are at greater risk of poor
outcomes.

 REP from death certificate data from the state of Minnesota.
Hospitalizations, ED visits, and outpatient visits were col-
lected through the REP, which, as previously described,
collects information from nearly all inpatient and outpatient
care for residents in the 11 county regions included in this
study. Outpatient visits for tests, imaging, or procedures were
not included. ED visits that resulted in a hospitalization were
counted as both an ED visit and a hospitalization. In-hospital
transfers were counted as one hospitalization.
Statistical Analysis
Splines were used to determine optimal cut points for the
categorization of perceived social isolation: low (scores, 4-8),
moderate (scores, 9–12), and high (scores, 13–20). These cut
points correspond to patients in the low group on average
responding to questions with responses of never to rarely,
those in the moderate group responding rarely to sometimes,
and those in the high group responding sometimes to always.
Baseline characteristics are presented as frequency (per-
centage) for categorical variables, mean (SD) for normally
distributed continuous variables, or median (interquartile
range) for continuous variables, with a skewed distribution.
Mantel-Haenszel v2 tests and linear regression were used to
test trends in characteristics across the perceived social
isolation categories.
Mortality was assessed with the Kaplan-Meier method,
according to perceived social isolation categories and com-
pared with the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regres-
sion was used to examine the association between perceived
social isolation and death. Univariate models were run first and
then covariates, including age, sex, marital status, education,
and the Charlson comorbidity index, were added to the model.
The cumulative mean number of hospitalizations and ED
visits over follow-up time by perceived social isolation
category were plotted using a nonparametric estimator
described by Nelson.17 To determine if perceived social
isolation predicts ED visits or hospitalizations, Andersen-Gill
modeling was used to account for repeated events, univari-
ately and while controlling for baseline characteristics. The
proportional hazard assumption was tested using the scaled
Schoenfeld residuals and was found to be valid.
Outpatient visits during follow-up may cluster (eg, patients
may have multiple outpatient visits on a given day or within a
span of several days as part of the diagnostic process or for
yearly physical examinations). To account for this, the
association between perceived social isolation and outpatient
office visits was evaluated by calculating the number of visits
per person-year for each patient and modeled with negative
binomial regression. To test for a dose-response relationship
between perceived social isolation and outcomes, we mod-
eled perceived social isolation as a 3-level variable.
All analyses were performed using SAS statistical software,
version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). This study was
approved by the Mayo Clinic and Olmsted Medical Center
Institutional Review Boards.
Results
Among 4462 patients identified with HF and mailed a survey,
patients were excluded for the following reasons: deceased
(n=207), unavailable for follow-up (n=20), physically/mentally
unable (n=324), and language barrier (n=44), resulting in 3867
patients. Among these patients, a total of 2003 returned the
survey (response rate, 52%). Patients who returned the survey
were slightly older at the time of HF (72.4 versus 71.4 years;
P=0.022) compared with patients who did not, but were similar
for sex (P=0.671) and Charlson comorbidity index (P=0.197).
Patients with complete perceived social isolation data were
retained for the analysis (N=1681; mean age, 73.3 years;
53.4% men). Patients with complete data were slightly younger
at the time of survey completion (73.3 versus 75.2 years;
P=0.018) compared with patients who were missing perceived
social isolation data, but they were similar for sex (P=0.412)
and Charlson comorbidity index (P=0.627). Approximately 19%
(n=312) of respondents had moderate perceived social isola-
tion, and 6% (n=108) had high perceived social isolation.
Patients with moderate or high perceived social isolation were,
on average, younger, more likely to be women, and less likely to
be married than those with low perceived social isolation, but
they were similar with regard to education and most comor-
bidities (Table 1). However, patients with moderate or high
perceived social isolation were more likely to have depression.
After a mean�SD follow-up of 8�4 months, 59 deaths
occurred. Greater perceived social isolation was associated with
an increased risk ofdeath(Figure 1). Patientsreporting moderate
perceived social isolation did not have a statistically significant
increased risk of death compared with those reporting low
perceivedsocialisolation(hazardratio[HR],1.40;95% confidence
interval [CI], 0.74–2.65); however, patients with high perceived
socialisolationhad>3timesincreasedriskofdeath(HR,3.23;95%
CI, 1.60–6.51; Table 2). After adjustment for age, sex, education,
marital status, and Charlson comorbidity index, the association
remained,with�3.75timesincreasedriskofdeath(HR,3.74;95%
CI, 1.82–7.70). Results were similar after further adjustment for
depression.
A total of 533 hospitalizations and 1000 ED visits occurred
during follow-up. Greater perceived social isolation was
associated with an increased risk of hospitalizations and ED
visits (Figure 2). Patients reporting moderate perceived social
isolation did not have a statistically significant increased risk
of hospitalization or ED visit compared with those reporting
low perceived social isolation (hospitalizations: HR, 1.02; 95%
CI, 0.74–1.40; ED visits: HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.85–1.50);

 however, patients with high perceived social isolation had a
76% and 70% increased risk of hospitalizations and ED visits,
respectively (hospitalizations: HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.24–2.50;
ED visits: HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.20–2.40). After adjustment for
age,

status,
and
comorbidities,
patients with high perceived social isolation had >68% and
57% increased risk of hospitalizations and ED visits, respec-
tively (hospitalizations: HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.18–2.39; ED visits:
HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.09–2.27). Additional adjustment for
depression did not materially change the results.
During follow-up, 13 431 outpatient visits occurred. The
overall rate of outpatient visits per person-year was 11.70, and
the rate was 11.08, 13.44, and 13.61 among patients with low,
moderate, and high perceived social isolation, respectively.
Patients with moderate and high perceived social isolation had
higher use of outpatient services compared with patients with
low perceived social isolation (rate ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04–
1.32; and rate ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.00–1.47 for moderate and
high perceived social isolation, respectively; Table 2). Adjust-
ment for age, sex, education, marital status, and comorbidities
did not substantially change the results (rate ratio, 1.16; 95% CI,
1.03–1.31; and rate ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.04–1.53 for
moderate and high perceived social isolation, respectively).
Results were similar after adjustment for depression.
Discussion
In this study of community patients with HF, �25% of patients
reported moderate to high levels of perceived social isolation,
as measured by the PROMIS Social Isolation Short Form.
Compared with those with low perceived social isolation,
patients with high perceived social isolation had an increased

 risk of death, hospitalizations, ED visits, and outpatient visits,
even after controlling for depressive symptoms, which often
co-occur with perceived social isolation. Patients with mod-
erate perceived social isolation also had an increased risk of
outpatient visits.
Perceived Social Isolation in HF
Approximately 6% of our community patients with HF reported
a high level of perceived social isolation, and 19% reported
moderate perceived social isolation. We found that patients
with HF with high or moderate perceived social isolation
compared with patients with low perceived social isolation
tended to be younger and were more likely to be women.
After adjustment for demographics and comorbidities,
including depression, we found that patients with moderate
perceived social isolation did not have a statistically signif-
icant increased risk of death, hospitalizations, or ED visits
compared with patients with low perceived social isolation;
however, patients with high perceived social isolation had
>3.5 times increased risk of death, 1.7 times increased risk of
hospitalization, and 1.6 times increased risk of ED visits.
Patients with moderate perceived social isolation were 16%
more likely to have an outpatient visit, whereas patients with
high perceived social isolation were 26% more likely. It is
especially interesting that those with the most pronounced
hypervigilance for social threat are also those with the highest
healthcare use, and additional research is needed to under-
stand these pathways. Our study expands on previous
research reporting on the association of perceived social
isolation and outcomes in a large community-based cohort of
patients with HF using the PROMIS Social Isolation Short
Form, which could be readily adopted into clinical practice.
Furthermore, we not only studied hospitalization and ED visits,
but also outpatient visits, to get a more complete picture of
the association between perceived social isolation and
healthcare use.

Social Isolation in Heart Failure

 Clinical Implications
These results have important implications because we have
shown that perceived social isolation, as measured by the
PROMIS Social Isolation Short Form, has important prognostic
value in patients with HF. Although future research is needed
to understand the mechanism by which perceived social
isolation leads to poorer outcomes, it has been recommended
that clinicians assess perceived social isolation during the
clinical encounter to identify patients who feel isolated.18 The
PROMIS Social Isolation Short Form provides a reliable,
precise, and well-validated measure of perceived social
isolation that could be feasibly administered during the
clinical encounter.13 By assessing perceived social isolation
with 4 brief questions,13 clinicians can identify patients who
are at a higher risk for mortality and healthcare use. Thus,
interventions can be targeted to these patients to help them
manage their disease and improve outcomes. There have
been several self-care interventions in HF,19–21 and although
the effect of self-care on preventing mortality in previous work
has been inconsistent,22,23 there is evidence to suggest that
self-care interventions can help prevent hospitalizations in
patients with HF. The assistance offered to patients who are
socially isolated will vary by the needs of the patient and by
available patient and community resources. Perceived social
isolation may be the result of individual, circumstantial, or
environmental conditions or some combination thereof.
Therefore, means to address perceived social isolation will
vary accordingly, and may involve referral to psychological or
social services, establishing connections with community
resources, or referral to specialized services to meet patient
needs.
Limitations and Strengths
As in any survey study, nonresponder bias could be an issue,
although we found that baseline characteristics were similar
between those who completed the survey and those who did
not. Although our response rate was somewhat higher than
response rates reported in national surveys,24 there is
emerging evidence that social isolation may affect response
rates, with respondents who are more socially isolated
tending to have lower cooperation rates.25,26 In addition,
our study was conducted in a population of mostly white race;
thus, the generalizability may be limited. We may have missed
some healthcare encounters that occurred outside of the REP.
Finally, we had a limited amount of follow-up time for
observation of outcomes.
Our study also has several strengths. This is a large
community-based cohort study, and via the REP, we have
comprehensive ascertainment of comorbidities, death, and
healthcare use in a large area of southeast Minnesota.10
Furthermore, we used a validated and reliable method to
measure perceived social isolation13 that is brief and thus
could be implemented in clinical practice.
Conclusions
In community patients with HF, �25% have a moderate or
high level of perceived social isolation. High perceived social
isolation is associated with an increased risk of death,
hospitalizations, ED visits, and outpatient visits. Thus, iden-
tifying perceived social isolation through use of a brief
screening tool in clinical practice may help target patients
with HF at increased risk of poor outcomes and death.
