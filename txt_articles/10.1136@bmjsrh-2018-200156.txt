Key messages
 
► Control over women’s reproductive 
autonomy by others is common and 
healthcare professionals need to ask 
specific questions about it.
 
► Control or coercion over decision-
making about use of contraception or 
about an established pregnancy comes 
in a wide range of forms.
 
► Contraceptive sabotage is deliberate 
interference with agreed use of 
contraception, so invalidating consent 
to sex.
AbstrAct
Background Reproductive control of women by 
others comprises a wide range of behaviours, 
from persuasion to pressure such as emotional 
blackmail, societal or family expectations, 
through to threats of or actual physical violence. 
It is defined as behaviours that interfere with 
women’s reproductive autonomy as well as any 
actions that pressurise or coerce a woman into 
initiating or terminating a pregnancy
Method Narrative review based on a search of 
medical and social science literature.
Results Reproductive control by others includes 
control or coercion over decisions about 
becoming pregnant and also about continuing 
or terminating a pregnancy. It can be carried out 
by intimate partners, the wider family, or as part 
of criminal behaviour. One form is contraceptive 
sabotage, which invalidates the consent given to 
sex. Contraceptive sabotage includes the newly-
described behaviour of ‘stealthing’: the covert 
removal of a condom during sex. Reproductive 
control by others is separate from intimate 
partner violence but there are similarities and 
the phenomena overlap. Reproductive control 
by others is reported by as many as one quarter 
of women attending sexual and reproductive 
healthcare services. Those treating such women 
should be familiar with the concept and how to 
ameliorate its effects. Screening questions for 
its detection have been developed as well as 
interventions to reduce its risk.
Conclusions Reproductive control by others is 
common and those working in women’s health 
should be familiar with the concept and with 
screening tools used to detect it.
bAckground
Women should be able to choose freely 
whether and when they wish to have a 
family. In other words, they should have 
reproductive autonomy; by definition, 
reproductive autonomy means being free 
from coercion and violence.1 Various 
barriers to this exist,2 which are the topic 
of this review.
While intimate partner violence and 
reproductive coercion can occur between 
same sex couples and can be perpetrated 
by women on men,3 the focus of this 
review is reproductive coercion in which 
women are the coerced party. Reproduc-
tive control (RC) by others is common 
and many women presenting to contra-
ception and sexual health services may be 
currently subject to it, may have experi-
enced it in the past or may be at risk of 
experiencing it. RC may be a factor in 
contraceptive ‘failure’ or non-adherence; 
frequent requests for emergency contra-
ception; for pregnancy or sexually trans-
mitted infection (STI) testing; or in having 
more than one abortion. This review is 
aimed at readers without specific knowl-
edge of intimate partner violence and 
seeks to clarify the forms which RC can 
take, summarises relevant epidemiology, 
examines types of perpetrator and finishes 
with suggestions for screening for, and 
identifying, women experiencing it.
Reproductive 
coercion 
was 
first 
described in a systematic review in 2010.4

Academic Search and British Library searches were 
conducted for the terms ‘reproductive coercion’, 
‘reproductive control’ and ‘contraceptive sabotage’ 
since 2010, when the concept was first reported in 
mainstream sexual and reproductive health literature. 
Search parameters are shown in table 1. This narrative 
review describes a range of behaviours but does not 
attempt to analyse underlying motivations.
WhAt is reproductive control?
definition
RC over women, in the context of this review, is 
external and exerted by others. It is not to be confused 
with methods of fertility control (or birth control) 
which allow women themselves to be in control of 
their own reproductive lives.
RC of women by others comprises a wide range 
of behaviours, from persuasion to pressure such as 
emotional blackmail, societal or family expectations, 
through to threats of or actual physical violence. It can 
be defined as actions that interfere with a woman’s 
reproductive intentions and any actions that pressurise 
or coerce a woman into initiating or terminating a 
pregnancy.5 7 In this review the authors define RC more 
widely than many others, in the context of gendered 
control, coercion and violence.8 RC fundamentally 
interferes with women’s reproductive autonomy 
generally9 and with their autonomous sexual deci-
sion-making more specifically.10 Reproductive coer-
cion is a subset of RC and occurs when a credible threat 
of harm or force is made to control a woman.5 11 The 
perpetrators of RC and reproductive coercion may be 
sexual partners, but can extend beyond the intimate 
partner relationship, as outlined below.
RC is mediated through the decisions around whether 
or not to start, continue or terminate a pregnancy, 
including deployment of contraception, and may be 
exercised at various times in relation to intercourse, 
conception, gestation and delivery. It may occur before 
or during sex, with a refusal to use contraception, 
during the period of attempting to conceive or at any 
time in the gestation of an established pregnancy.12 RC 
is associated with negative mental health outcomes.13
perpetrators of reproductive control
In addition to intimate partners, the sources of RC 
include wider family members, acting alone or together. 
Cultural and social norms in a society can reinforce 
RC and may link individual and family behaviour.
epideMiology
As many as one-quarter of women of reproductive age 
attending for sexual and reproductive health services 
give a history of ever having suffered RC (see table 2). 
A negative association has been found between RC 
and contraceptive and sexual self-efficacy (planning 
for and assumption of responsibility for the direction 
of sexual activity and responsibility for contraceptive 
use).10
It has been known for some time that unin-
tended pregnancy occurs more frequently in abusive

Review
relationships.14 Miller et al found that the risk of 
unintended pregnancy doubled in those who suffered 
both intimate partner violence (IPV) and reproductive 
coercion.15 Several studies have shown a positive asso-
ciation between RC and unintended pregnancy.10 16 17 
A positive association has also been found between 
IPV and having an abortion; the association is even 
more pronounced when the women undergoing an 
abortion report that their partner has no knowledge 
of the abortion.18 There is a strong positive association 
between RC and IPV
.15 19–21 Women experiencing IPV 
are twice as likely to have a male partner who refuses 
to use contraception and to report unintended preg-
nancy and up to three times more likely to give birth as 
an adolescent, compared with those not experiencing 
such violence.9
Past experiences of RC decrease the odds of contra-
ceptive use at last vaginal sex.10 Women who have 
recently experienced RC are more likely to request 
pregnancy testing and STI testing and to seek emer-
gency contraception.17 Among US women in a repro-
ductive healthcare setting, black and multiracial 
ethnicity are both positively associated with RC.22–24 
Younger women are more frequent victims of RC,16 25 
and it is more likely to occur in longer-term relation-
ships than with casual partners.10
ForMs oF reproductive control 
perpetrAted by intiMAte pArtners
unprotected sex
One of the the most common RC behaviours is for 
male partners to tell women not to use contracep-
tion.26 Partners themselves may also refuse to use 
condoms or tell a woman later that they did not use 
a condom.27 In addition to this, some women may be 
prevented from obtaining initial or repeat supplies of 
contraception.25 Women report that their partners 
want to have children, particularly male children, or 
may want to maintain a permanent connection with 
their female partner.5 25 Emotional blackmail may be 
used, for example, ‘You would have my baby if you 
loved me’.4 More serious threats of actual violence, 
deprivation of food, threats of removal of children or 
actual forced intercourse may also be used.25 26 Partner 
infidelity is a common associated behaviour.25
contraceptive sabotage
As with the topic of RC in general, contraceptive 
sabotage can be perpetrated by various means: from 
a reluctance or poor effort to use condoms,28 through 
to a violent and invasive removal of an intrauterine 
contraceptive device. It includes ‘stealthing’, first 
publicised by Alexandra Brodsky in April 2017.29 This 
is defined as the non-consensual, surreptitious removal 
of a condom during sex, when consent has been given 
only for condom-protected sex. Alternatively, a male 
partner may falsely state that he has had a vasectomy. 
The most common means of contraceptive sabotage 
are failure to practise withdrawal, as previously agreed, 
or non-use of condoms. Contraceptive sabotage also 
includes various actions including piercing condoms 
or other barrier methods, throwing away supplies of 
oral contraceptives or forcibly removing transdermal 
patches, vaginal rings or intrauterine devices.5
Contraceptive sabotage interacts and overlaps with 
sexual coercion and violence. In such cases, consent to 
sex has been given on the understanding that contra-
ception will be used. Contraceptive sabotage thus inval-
idates consent, but there are complicated arguments 
as to how any legal redress would be sought against 
saboteurs.29–31 Currently, in most jurisdictions, it 
seems likely that cases of contraceptive sabotage taken 
to court would be unsuccessful. However, in Canada, 
a man did receive an 18 
month prison sentence for 
depriving his partner of her ability to consent to sex.32
Women’s actions to reassert reproductive autonomy
Women’s reactions to RC include capitulation, seeking 
contraceptive methods that can be used covertly, or 
ending the relationship. In some studies women report 
attempting to avoid pregnancy by concealing their use 
of contraception. Contraceptives with varying degrees 
of concealability are injections, implants, intrauterine 
devices and sterilisation. Injectables are ‘invisible’ as 
there are no tell-tale signs (palpable rod, threads at the 
cervix or abdominal scars). But even when conceal-
able contraceptives are being deployed, a partner may 
discover an appointment on a card, in an email or on 
a smartphone. Some women being subjected to IPV 
will be put off using concealable methods because of 
the fear of retaliation if their partner were to find out. 
Experience of RC is associated with fear of asking a 
partner to use a condom and fear of the consequences 
of refusing to have sex with a partner.22 Women in 
violent relationships risk an escalation of violence if 
they try to negotiate contraceptive use.25
Pregnancy testing may also need to be concealed. 
Flushable pregnancy tests have become available, the 
advantage of which (in addition to their ecological 
credentials) is that no ‘evidence’ of having used them 
remains to be discovered.33
coerced continuation of a pregnancy
RC can include the insistence on continuation of a 
pregnancy which the woman regards as unintended 
or unwanted.6 It is carried out by a variety of means 
ranging from physical violence, threats of violence or 
forced sex, to more subtle acts such as threats to with-
hold resources or to have a baby with someone else, 
if the pregnancy is terminated. Some partners refuse 
to provide childcare or transport on the day of an 
appointment with an abortion provider or sabotage a 
woman’s fasting regimen before her procedure under 
general anaesthetic.5
Medical abortion may suit a woman being subjected 
to RC better than surgical abortion.34 There is no

Review
post-anaesthetic recovery necessary and women can 
attribute the bleeding to a spontaneous miscarriage. 
Jurisdictions that allow misoprostol to be taken at 
home greatly facilitate this process.
Forced or induced termination of an established 
pregnancy
Induced (therapeutic) abortion may be coerced35 or a 
woman may be assaulted with the intention of causing 
a miscarriage. It has been shown that exposure to 
gender-based violence predicts having an abortion.36 37 
A survey of lower-income US men demonstrated that 
those who admitted that they had perpetrated IPV 
were more likely than those who had not to have been 
involved with a pregnancy that ended in abortion.38 
The abusive men were also more likely to have been 
in conflict with their partner at the time over the preg-
nancy, either in seeking to force an abortion or to 
prevent an abortion.
At the extreme end of the spectrum, male partners 
have covertly spiked either food or drink with abor-
tifacients. This criminal activity has been reported 
from Norway,39 the UK40 and the USA41 (including 
two perpetrators who were doctors, abusing their 
privileged access to prescription-only drugs) and is 
usually punished by imprisonment. In Brazil, two 
criminal cases of older men meeting teenage girls for 
sex involved pregnancies being ended by surreptitious 
vaginal application of misoprostol.42
reproductive control perpetrAted by the 
Wider FAMily
In some settings, in-laws may perpetrate gender-based 
violence through a wide variety of types of abuse 
during pregnancy, at delivery and postpartum.43 The 
degree to which such abuse during pregnancy overlaps 
with RC is not known.
control over family size
In some cultural settings, the wider family and in 
particular older female relatives may have societally 
endorsed control over reproductive decision-making. 
Patriarchal cultural norms, and contexts wherein 
brides live with the husband’s family, may facilitate this 
kind of control. Examples from the literature include 
reports that assent from mothers-in-law is often neces-
sary for decision-making on the composition of the 
family (one or two sons usually being thought to be 
needed) and also for sterilisation (a signal that the 
family is complete and the most common form of 
fertility control used in India).44 Contraceptive sabo-
tage by proxy can occur. An example from the litera-
ture is a mother-in-law who puts pressure on her son 
not to use condoms.44 Women with no sons may have 
low status and may suffer discrimination, which can 
act as an emotional means of controlling reproductive 
intention.
coerced conception and pressure to conceive or continue 
a pregnancy
In some situations the in-law family can exert a 
profound degree of control over their daughter-
in-law’s life if she is slow to conceive or does not 
conceive.45 This may consist of forcing a woman to 
abandon use of contraception, or telling their son to 
leave her, have a baby with someone else or otherwise 
to punish her through emotional or physical abuse. 
Deprivations commonly inflicted on a daughter-in-law 
are restrictions to the supply of food, confining her to 
the house, and other insults and humiliations. Family 
abusers use the same methods as partner abusers11; 
this behaviour is domestic violence but extends more 
widely than IPV
.
In addition to coerced conception, coercion to 
continue with an established pregnancy against the 
wishes of the woman may originate from the wider 
family.6
Forced termination of a pregnancy
RC in the form of forced abortion of a wanted preg-
nancy may be perpetrated against women by the wider 
family. Coerced abortion may be part of a violent 
behaviour pattern, which includes IPV
, rape and 
sometimes incest within families.36 In South Asia in 
particular, there are reports of abuse of women during 
pregnancy by in-laws, including forced abortion.43 The 
abuse may be based on intergenerational discordance 
between the family-building intentions of a woman 
and the expectations of the in-laws.37
perpetrAtors involved in sex trAFFicking 
And sexuAl exploitAtion
Coerced abortion may also be part of organised crim-
inal activity. This includes child sexual exploitation.46 
The pimp–prostitute relationship often exhibits coer-
cive control and violence similar to IPV
.47 Coerced 
abortion has been described in victims of sex traf-
ficking in the USA.48
detection, educAtion, hArM reduction 
And prevention
Women subjected to RC may not necessarily have 
insight into their relationship, especially if there is no 
physical or sexual violence.4 The degree of control that 
a male partner can have will vary from mild to extreme. 
Milder amounts of control may not be perceived by 
the victim as unhealthy or abusive. Women in a long-
term relationship may become inured to significant 
levels of RC.
Screening for RC should take place in maternity, 
sexual and reproductive health and abortion services 
and in general practice settings. Suggested screening 
questions have been formulated (see Figure 1).49 
Professionals have the opportunity not only to detect 
RC, but to discuss healthy relationships. Where neces-
sary, help with negotiating condom use and, if RC is

disclosed, employing concealable methods may be 
offered. Healthcare professionals can also ensure that 
women know how to access emergency contraception. 
Injectables, implants, intrauterine contraception (if 
necessary with the threads cut short to avoid detec-
tion) and sterilisation are possible concealable methods 
of contraception. This advice should take place within 
the wider context of helping women minimise or 
escape from situations of domestic violence, and of 
safeguarding activity.
There are examples of excellent educational materials 
on RC that have been developed.50 51 An educational 
intervention was found to reduce the odds of preg-
nancy coercion by 71% and to significantly increase 
the odds of ending a relationship due to perceptions 
that it was unhealthy.52 The ARCHES (Addressing 
Reproductive Coercion in Health Settings) study is 
under way; this will provide information about the 
efficacy of a brief intervention on the risk of RC.53
discussion
Findings and interpretation
RC is common; professionals working in women’s 
health, sexual and reproductive health, abortion and 
maternity services should be aware of the concept and 
be equipped to screen for it. RC is primarily carried 
out by intimate partners, but it is also perpetrated by 
the wider family and in organised criminal activity. 
The perpetrators’ focus of control may vary, at times 
coercing pregnancy and at other times coercing abor-
tion. Coerced abortion may be part of sex trafficking 
or sexual exploitation.
RC infringes women’s reproductive rights and 
erodes women’s reproductive autonomy. Past expe-
rience of RC adversely affects women’s feelings of 
agency during sexual and contraceptive interactions.
relevance of the findings and implications for clinicians 
or policymakers
Those working in health and social care specialties 
relating to women’s health, and in general practice, 
should be aware of RC; it may be an underlying cause of 
contraceptive non-adherence. Healthcare professionals 
should be alert to it in consultations with women who 
are displaying behavioural patterns such as persistent lack 
of use of contraception (despite not wishing to become 
pregnant), frequent requests for emergency contracep-
tion, frequent attendances for pregnancy testing or STI 
testing, and requests for more than one abortion.
There are now screening questions for its detection 
and interventions that can assist in reducing its risks. 
Women attending health services with escorts should, 
at some stage, be seen alone so that these sensitive 
issues can be raised and, if necessary, explored. Infor-
mation may need to be shared with safeguarding agen-
cies, especially with respect to younger women, or 
those who lack mental capacity.
Public health policymakers need to take account 
of RC as a causative factor in unintended pregnancy. 
The findings in this review reinforce the importance 
of teaching children about healthy relationships, 
including respect for partners and open communica-
tion about contraceptive use.
unanswered questions and future research
Research so far has been almost exclusively undertaken 
in the USA; research in other countries is to be encour-
aged. There remains much to be learnt about RC and 
how it affects women. In particular, more research is 
needed on the non-physical elements of abusive rela-
tionships and how coercive control can be resisted. 
Also, more needs to be understood about whether RC 
relates to a particular partner or whether RC experi-
ences with one partner negatively impact future sexual 
relationships.
More understanding of perpetrators’ motivations 
for engaging in RC is needed. Further research should 
be conducted on the reasons partners engage in RC 
behaviours, as well as women’s perceptions of partner 
intent. Young people are especially vulnerable to RC 
and research is needed which focuses on the dating 
relationships of young people.
As always, in an era of shrinking resources and over-
stretched healthcare professionals, the most efficient 
and effective means of using routine healthcare consul-
tations to identify and reduce the harms of RC need to 
be identified and disseminated.
