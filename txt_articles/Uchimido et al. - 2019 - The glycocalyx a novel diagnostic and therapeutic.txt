The glycocalyx: a novel diagnostic and
therapeutic target in sepsis
Ryo Uchimido1*
, Eric P. Schmidt2 and Nathan I. Shapiro1
Abstract
The glycocalyx is a gel-like layer covering the luminal surface of vascular endothelial cells. It is comprised of
membrane-attached proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycan chains, glycoproteins, and adherent plasma proteins. The
glycocalyx maintains homeostasis of the vasculature, including controlling vascular permeability and microvascular
tone, preventing microvascular thrombosis, and regulating leukocyte adhesion.
During sepsis, the glycocalyx is degraded via inflammatory mechanisms such as metalloproteinases, heparanase, and
hyaluronidase. These sheddases are activated by reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as
tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1beta. Inflammation-mediated glycocalyx degradation leads to vascular
hyper-permeability, unregulated vasodilation, microvessel thrombosis, and augmented leukocyte adhesion. Clinical
studies have demonstrated the correlation between blood levels of glycocalyx components with organ dysfunction,
severity, and mortality in sepsis.
Fluid resuscitation therapy is an essential part of sepsis treatment, but overaggressive fluid therapy practices (leading to
hypervolemia) may augment glycocalyx degradation. Conversely, fresh frozen plasma and albumin administration may
attenuate glycocalyx degradation. The beneficial and harmful effects of fluid and plasma infusion on glycocalyx
integrity in sepsis are not well understood; future studies are warranted.
In this review, we first analyze the underlying mechanisms of glycocalyx degradation in sepsis. Second, we demonstrate
how the blood and urine levels of glycocalyx components are associated with patient outcomes. Third, we show
beneficial and harmful effects of fluid therapy on the glycocalyx status during sepsis. Finally, we address the concept of
glycocalyx degradation as a therapeutic target.

Introduction
The glycocalyx is a gel-like layer lining the luminal sur-
face of endothelial cells, composed of membrane-bound
proteoglycans, glycoproteins, glycosaminoglycans, and
adherent plasma proteins [1]. It performs several func-
tions necessary for vascular homeostasis: it regulates
vascular permeability and microvascular tone, inhibits
microvascular thrombosis, and helps regulate leukocyte
adhesion on the endothelium [2–4]. During sepsis,
glycocalyx degradation occurs due to a combination of
pathophysiologic insults, potentially compounded by
iatrogenic effects of accompanying fluid resuscitation
practices [5–9]. Glycocalyx fragments shed into the blood
during sepsis may serve as clinically relevant biomarkers,
given the pathophysiologic implications of glycocalyx deg-
radation. The degradation of glycocalyx is also thought to
contribute to microcirculatory dysfunction in sepsis [10].
The objectives of this article are to review: 1) human
studies that investigate the association of biomarkers of
glycocalyx degradation with clinical outcomes, 2) mecha-
nisms of glycocalyx degradation, and 3) the potential of
the glycocalyx as a therapeutic target in sepsis.
Background
Components and structure
The glycocalyx is a layer that lines the luminal surface of
vascular endothelial cells (Fig. 1). The thickness and
structure of the glycocalyx vary across different species,

 vascular beds, organs, and blood flow rates [11]. Its
observed thickness in humans is approximately 0.5 to
5.0 μm [12–18]. The glycocalyx consists of proteo-
glycans (PG), glycoproteins bound with sialic acid,
glycosaminoglycans
(GAG),
and
associated
plasma
proteins [1]. Proteoglycans are core proteins anchored
to the apical membrane of endothelial cells, to which
several
GAG
chains
are
covalently
attached
[19].
There are many different types of proteoglycans, but
syndecan-1 (a subtype of syndecan family from 1 to
4) is a primary target of prior endothelial glycocalyx
investigations [20]. GAG chains that bind to proteo-
glycans include heparan sulfate (a major component
of GAGs, comprising over 50% of GAGs in glycoca-
lyx), chondroitin sulfates, dermatan sulfates, and pos-
sibly keratin sulfates [21]. These sulfated GAGs are
negatively charged, enabling electrostatic interaction
with plasma proteins [17]. In contrast, hyaluronan
(hyaluronic acid) is a large linear molecule that does
not bind to proteoglycans, but instead interacts with
cell-membrane CD44. Hyaluronan also differs from
other GAGs as it is not sulfated and is therefore un-
charged. However, hyaluronan can form complexes
with other sulfated GAGs, enabling it to sequester
water and stabilize the gel-like structure of the glyco-
calyx [21]. Proteins such as albumin, fibrinogen, fibro-
nectin, thrombomodulin, antithrombin III, superoxide
dismutase, and cell-adhesion molecules all interact
with GAGs.
Glycocalyx function in health and disease
In the healthy state, the glycocalyx serves as a barrier
opposing vascular permeability, in part by serving as a
negatively charged molecular sieve [3]. This “meshwork”
limits transvascular movement of negatively charged
and/or larger than 70-kDa molecules. By establishing a
transvascular albumin gradient, the intact glycocalyx
regulates transvascular fluid flux (in accordance with the
so-called
“revised”
Starling
equation)
[3,
4,
22].
Additionally, the glycocalyx senses fluid shear forces and
transmits these forces to endothelial cells, initiating
nitric oxide-mediated vasorelaxation. The glycocalyx
provides anti-coagulant and anti-adhesive effects on the
surface of endothelial cells. Moreover, it can shield endo-
thelial cells from oxidative stress. In sepsis, the glycoca-
lyx
is
degraded
and
cannot
perform
its
normal
functions, which leads to enhanced vascular permeabil-
ity, tissue edema, augmented leukocyte adhesion, platelet
aggregation, and dysregulated vasodilation (Fig. 1) [20].
Thus, it is hypothesized that these dysfunctions of glyco-
calyx, mainly resulting from its degradation, have a role
in the early diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis; and restor-
ation of the glycocalyx is a potential therapeutic target.
Degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx during sepsis
In sepsis, the degraded glycocalyx layer becomes thinner
and more sparse, allowing plasma proteins (e.g., albumin)
and fluid to move across the vascular wall, leading to tis-
sue edema formation (Fig. 1) [6, 23]. This degradation

 releases glycocalyx components (such as syndecan-1, hep-
aran sulfate, hyaluronan, chondroitin sulfates) into the
plasma. Several enzymes mediate this degradation. Hepar-
anase directly cleaves the heparan sulfate chains attached
to core proteoglycans. Metalloproteinases (MMPs) are
known to cleave proteoglycans (e.g. syndecan-1) directly
from the endothelial cell membrane [18, 24]. These
specific enzymes are activated in inflammatory states by
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pro-inflammatory cyto-
kines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and
interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) [18, 20, 24–26]. Elevated hepara-
nase expression can secondarily increase MMP expression
in myeloma cells [27], suggesting cross-talk between
sheddases.
Many preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated
a decrease in the thickness of the glycocalyx in sepsis. For
example, Wiesinger et al. [28] found that mice treated
with intravenous lipopolysaccharide (LPS) had a signifi-
cant reduction in aorta glycocalyx thickness compared to
controls (0.27 ± 0.012 μm vs 0.14 ± 0.017 μm, p < 0.0001).
Furthermore, human umbilical venous endothelial cells
showed a 50% reduction in the glycocalyx thickness when
the cells were treated with TNF-α or LPS in vitro. Nieuw-
dorp et al. [29] used a human volunteer endotoxin model
to study the glycocalyx in sepsis. In 13 healthy human
subjects who received low-dose intravenous endotoxin, a
significant decrease in sublingual glycocalyx thickness was
observed (0.60 ± 0.1 μm to 0.30 ± 0.1 μm, p < 0.01) with a
concurrent elevation of plasma hyaluronan (62 ± 18 to 85
± 24 ng/mL, p < 0.05).
Vascular heterogeneity of the glycocalyx layer
Endothelial cells from different vascular beds (organ-spe-
cific) and vascular locations (arteriole, capillary, and ven-
ule) display different glycocalyxes [30]. In vivo, pulmonary
artery endothelial cells are enriched with α-galactose car-
bohydrates, while pulmonary microvascular endothelial
cells are enriched with α- and β-N-acetylgalactosamine
carbohydrates [31]. Schmidt et al. [18] found that the
thickness of pulmonary microvascular endothelial glycoca-
lyx of healthy mice (n = 43, 1.67 ± 0.09 μm) is substantially
greater than that of cremasteric microvessels (n = 9, 0.67
± 0.08 μm). Furthermore, mechanisms of glycocalyx shed-
ding may differ across vascular beds, as septic induction of
pulmonary endothelial heparanase was not observed in
cremasteric endothelial cells [18]. The geographic hetero-
geneity of glycocalyx structure and degradation is a focus
of current investigations.
Measures of glycocalyx degradation in sepsis
Direct bedside imaging of glycocalyx degradation during
sepsis
Orthogonal phase spectrometry (OPS) or sidestream dark
field (SDF) imaging are intravital microscopy imaging
techniques capable of assessing sublingual microvascular
thickness at the bedside [16, 32]. The perfusion boundary
region (PBR), a SDF-measured parameter that is inversely
related to the glycocalyx thickness, has been proposed as a
proxy of the glycocalyx thickness. Donati et al. [33] re-
ported that the discriminative performance of PBR for the
presence of sepsis as the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUC) is 0.67 (95% CI 0.52–0.82,
p = 0.05). While immediate assessment of glycocalyx
degradation via handheld microscopy may be a promising
diagnostic/prognostic test in early sepsis, concerns remain
for inter-observer reliability and relevance of the sublin-
gual microcirculation as a marker of clinically relevant
organ injury. As such, further studies are required.
Quantification of septic glycocalyx degradation using
circulating biomarkers
Syndecan-1
Studies demonstrate that syndecan-1 shedding is associ-
ated with both sepsis presence and severity (Table 1).
Nelson et al. [34] reported that septic shock patients ad-
mitted to the intensive care unit (ICU; n = 18) had a sig-
nificantly higher median level of syndecan-1 compared to
healthy controls (n = 18; 246 [interquartile range (IQR)
180–496] ng/mL vs 26 [IQR 23–31] ng/mL, p < 0.001).
They also detected a correlation between syndecan-1 level
with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score
(r = 0.48, p < 0.05) and Cardiovascular SOFA score (r =
0.69, p < 0.01) during the first 24 h of admission. Despite
these findings, there was no association between the me-
dian level of syndecan-1 and mortality. Steppan et al. [35]
compared syndecan-1 levels among three groups; healthy
volunteers (n = 18), patients after major abdominal surgery
(n = 28), and severe sepsis/septic shock patients (n = 104).
The mean syndecan-1 levels for both the surgery group
(50.5 ± 46.9 ng/mL) and sepsis group (160 ± 109 ng/mL)
were higher compared to controls (20.5 ± 5.05 ng/mL) (p =
0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). Sallisalmi et al. [36] found
that ventilated adult patients with septic shock (n = 20) in
the ICU had significantly higher median syndecan-1 than
healthy controls. They also reported a significant correl-
ation of syndecan-1 levels with SOFA score on day 1 of
ICU admission (r = 0.654, p < 0.002). Ostrowski et al. [37]
showed a correlation between syndecan-1 levels and SOFA
scores

shock (r = 0.60, p = 0.051).
Puskarich et al. [38] compared median syndecan-1
levels at enrollment between patients who required in-
tubation
and

found
that
syndecan-1 levels in intubated patients were not signifi-

 The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis
showed syndecan-1 levels alone poorly predicted intubation
(AUC 0.58, 95% CI 0.48–0.68). However, the syndecan-1
levels in patients who developed acute kidney injury (AKI)
were higher than in those who did not (193 ng/mL [IQR
63–441] vs 93 ng/mL [IQR 23–187], p < 0.001).
Heparan sulfate
Heparan sulfate is also reported as elevated in sepsis.
Steppan et al. [35] compared heparan sulfate levels among
healthy volunteers (n = 18), patients after major abdominal
surgery (n = 28), and severe sepsis/septic shock patients
(n = 104). Mean heparan sulfate levels were significantly
higher in the surgery group (7.96 ± 3.26 μg/ml, p < 0.001)
and sepsis group (3.23 ± 2.43 μg/ml, p = 0.03) compared to
control values (1.96 ± 1.21 μg/ml). Additionally, septic
patients had significantly lower mean levels of heparan
sulfate than surgery patients (3.23 ± 2.43 μg/ml vs 7.96 ±
3.26 μg/ml, p < 0.001). Nelson et al. [39] found fourfold
significantly higher levels of heparan sulfate in 24 patients
with septic shock compared to 24 controls scheduled for
neurosurgery. Additionally, patients who died within 90
days had fivefold significantly higher levels of heparan sul-
fate compared to survivors. Schmidt et al. [40] investi-
gated plasma levels of heparan sulfate in ICU patients
mechanically ventilated with respiratory failure due to al-
tered mental status (n = 4), indirect lung injury (n = 6),
and direct lung injury (n = 7). They measured heparan sul-
fate levels in plasma collected upon ICU admission and
found that patients with indirect lung injury had 23-fold
higher median levels of heparan sulfate compared to nor-
mal donors. These patients also had increased heparan
sulfate degradation activity in this (and a prior study [18]),
indicating that mechanically ventilated patients with indir-
ect lung injury might have elevated systematic heparanase
activity. They also demonstrated that heparan sulfate
plasma levels of the 17 ICU patients with mechanical ven-
tilation were positively and significantly correlated with
ICU length of stay (r = 0.58, p = 0.01).
Similarly, Schmidt et al. [41] assessed urine heparin
sulfate, which may primarily reflect renal glycocalyx deg-
radation. They compared 30 medical ICU septic shock
patients with 25 severe trauma patients in surgical ICU
as controls and found significantly higher heparan sul-
fate levels in the urine of sepsis patients. They also
found urine heparan sulfate levels to be highly prognos-
tic for mortality with an AUC of 0.86, which remained
significant after adjusting for Acute Physiology and
Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores (AUC
0.91, p = 0.0003). In this study, heparan sulfate was the
only GAG that had a significant AUC with mortality
after the adjustment; hyaluronic acid and chondroitin
sulfate were not prognostic.
Hyaluronan
In the study by Schmidt et al. described above [41], the
mean hyaluronan concentration in urine in septic shock
patients was significantly higher than that from severe
trauma patients. Sepsis non-survivors had a significantly
higher mean level of hyaluronan at study entry compared
to survivors. The ROC analysis showed a strong un-
adjusted AUC for hospital mortality of 0.86 (p < 0.001).
Urinary hyaluronan also strongly predicted the later onset
of renal failure (AUC 0.75, p < 0.02). In a study of plasma
hyaluronan, Yagmur et al. [42] classified 150 ICU patients
without cirrhosis into three categories; no systemic
inflammatory response syndrome (no-SIRS; n = 20), SIRS
(n = 33), and sepsis (n = 97). Sepsis patients had a higher
median level of hyaluronan (344 ng/mg [IQR 0–2641])
versus no-SIRS (116 ng/mg [IQR 10–2457], p = 0.014.)
and SIRS (168 ng/mg [IQR 0–2117], p = 0.015). However,
they did not find a significant association between hyalur-
onan level and mortality.
Mechanisms of glycocalyx degradation in sepsis
Inflammation-induced glycocalyx degradation
Many preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated
an association between inflammatory cytokines such as
TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 and glycocalyx degrad-
ation biomarkers [28, 29, 39, 42–45]. Schmidt et al. [18]
showed TNF-α was sufficient to induce glycocalyx degrad-
ation in septic mice. Furthermore, by using TNF-α recep-
tor 1-deficient mice, they demonstrated that TNF-α
signaling was necessary for glycocalyx degradation. This
degradation was mediated by heparanase activation, as
TNF-α treatment of lung microvascular endothelial cells
increased both heparanase post-translational activation as
well as heparan sulfate degradation activity.
Yang et al. [46] reported MMP15 (ADAM15) as a
sheddase for CD44 ectodomain both in vivo and vitro.
They found that in MMP15 knockdown endothelial
cells, the shedding of CD44 induced by LPS treatment
was greatly reduced. Similarly, in MMP15 knockout
mice, the shedding of CD44 induced by cecal ligation
puncture procedure is attenuated. However, the pathway
of how MMP15 is activated during sepsis is still unclear
in this study.
Recently angiopoietin 2 (Ang-2) has been investigated
as a key mediator of glycocalyx degradation. Ang-2 is a
protein secreted by endothelial cells in response to in-
flammatory stimuli. It serves as an intrinsic antagonist
of angiopoietin 1 (Ang-1), preventing anti-inflammatory
signaling usually induced by Ang-1 activation of its
receptor TIE2. Lukasz et al. [47] found that Ang-2 treat-
ment causes a rapid degradation of endothelial glycoca-
lyx both in vivo and vitro, using a human umbilical vein
endothelial cell line and mice. Han et al. [30] revealed
that inhibiting Ang-2 leads to the reduced shedding of
Uchimido et al. Critical Care           (2019) 23:16 
Page 7 of 12
 the endothelial glycocalyx and improved survival among
mice with sepsis, concluding that the inhibiting Ang-2
and activating TIE2 might be a potential therapeutic tar-
get in sepsis.
While inflammatory stimuli can initiate glycocalyx
degradation, glycocalyx integrity can also feed-back on
the processes of inflammation themselves. Heparan sul-
fates and syndecan-1 bind to chemokines on the cell
surface; release of these chemokines during degradation
might amplify inflammation by promoting additional
neutrophil recruitment [48–51]. This process has been
elucidated in epithelial injury by Li et al. [52], who found
that syndecan-1 binds to KC, a CXC chemokine, on the
surface of lung epithelial cells. Matrilysin-mediated shed-
ding of syndecan-1 ectodomain bound to KC created
transepithelial chemokine gradients and controlled the
neutrophil migration to the injured lung tissue. In endo-
thelial cells, the exact balance between the effects of lo-
calizing chemokines on the cell surface and the effect of
the release of the chemokine after the shedding remains
to be further studied [48].
Impact of fluid resuscitation on septic glycocalyx
degradation
Fluid resuscitation is an essential therapeutic treatment
for sepsis and septic shock [53]. However, the type of
fluid resuscitation used as well as the volume of resusci-
tation may significantly impact glycocalyx integrity.
Data suggest that excessive fluid resuscitation might cause
glycocalyx degradation
Hypervolemia has been associated with increased glyco-
calyx degradation in sepsis. Several preclinical and clin-
ical
studies
suggest
that
hypervolemia
induces
the
release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) by the cardiac
atrium in response to mechanical wall stress, which in
turn may degrade the glycocalyx [54]. Chappell et al.
[55] conducted a pilot study using elective cardiac sur-
gery patients with good cardiopulmonary function. They
compared serum levels of ANP and biomarkers of glyco-
calyx degradation (syndecan-1, heparan sulfate, and hya-
luronan) before and after volume loading with 6%
hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 (20 ml/kg; n = 9) and acute
normovolemic
hemodilution
(n = 9),
in
which
the
amount of blood drawn was simultaneously replaced
with similar amounts of 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES)
130/0.4. The mean ANP level was significantly increased
in volume loading group (13.6 ± 6.2 ng/g to 25.1 ± 11.4
ng/g albumin, p < 0.05; data normalized to grams per
deciliter of plasma albumin) whereas the normovolemic
group had no significant increase in the mean ANP level
(13.4 ± 3.5 ng/g to 14.8 ± 5.6 ng/g). The volume loading
had a corresponding significant increase in mean levels
of syndecan-1 (24.8 ± 8.1 to 45.4 ± 14.9 μg/g albumin)
and hyaluronan (32.6 ± 5.5 to 56.4 ± 12.2 μg/g albumin)
(p < 0.05 for each) while the normovolemic group pro-
duced no significant increased mean levels of all three
biomarkers.
These findings were corroborated in a preclinical study
that demonstrated that ANP independently induced glyco-
calyx degradation [56]. Isolated guinea pig hearts were first
infused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer for an equilibration
period. Then 6% HES solution was infused into the coron-
ary vascular system for 20 min without ANP (control
group, n = 6) and with ANP (ANP group, n = 6). The ANP
group had a 9- to18-fold higher level of syndecan-1 in their
coronary effluent at 6, 10, 15, and 20 mins after the start of
the HES infusion, compared to the control group. This cor-
responded to a decrease in glycocalyx thickness in coronary
vessels of the isolated guinea pig hearts as observed by elec-
tron microscopy. Puskarich et al. [38] investigated the asso-
ciation between syndecan-1 levels of patients with severe
sepsis or septic shock and the volume of fluid administered
to emergency department patients. They categorized their
175 patients analyzed based on syndecan-1 level into a high
group (syndecan-1 level ≥ 240 ng/mL) and low group (syn-
decan-1 level < 240 ng/mL) and found no difference in total
crystalloid volume of fluid administered between high and
low syndecan-1 groups (4.0 L [IQR 3.3–5.3] vs 3.5 L [IQR
2.4–5.0], p = 0.36). The association between hypervolemia
states with glycocalyx degradation in patients with sepsis
remains unclear.
While intriguing, a causal association between ANP
and glycocalyx shedding remains unproven. For ex-
ample, Hahn [57] suggested that volume loading only
modestly increases plasma concentrations of ANP. In
addition, to our knowledge there is no proven mechan-
ism by which ANP causes glycocalyx shedding. Further
studies are therefore required.
Use of colloids to protect glycocalyx integrity
Albumin, a colloid commonly used for volume resuscita-
tion, has been proposed to be glycocalyx-protective as it
carries
erythrocyte-derived
sphingosine-1-phosphate
(S1P) to the endothelium, where it can mediate glycoca-
lyx recovery by suppressing MMP activity [58, 59]. Jacob
et al. [60] showed albumin prevents glycocalyx degrad-
ation more effectively than HES and 0.9% normal saline
in their animal heart model. In this study, they did not
actually assess the glycocalyx, but evaluated the effect of
albumin and HES on vascular filtration, which reflects
glycocalyx degradation. They used isolated guinea pig
hearts pretreated with heparinase and perfused the
hearts with albumin (n = 5), 6% HES (n = 5), or 0.9% nor-
mal saline (n = 5). The vascular fluid filtration was
assessed as epicardial transudate formation. They found
the mean levels of transudate formation were dependent
on perfusion pressure and significantly lower in the 5%

 albumin group (2.16 ± 0.42 μl·min− 1·cm H2O− 1) com-
pared to the 0.9% normal saline group (p < 0.05, data not
shown). Following this study, Jacob et al. [61] reported
the protective effect of albumin in an ischemic model of
guinea pig hearts. The model treated with albumin had
significantly lower mean levels of syndecan-1 (8.8 ± 0.8
g/g dry weight (DW) vs 6.6 ± 0.8 g/g DW, p = 0.032) and
heparan sulfate (808 ± 176 g/g DW vs 328 ± 61 g/g DW,
p < 0.001) in the coronary effluent, as compared to
non-albumin treated model. We did not identify clinical
studies that investigated the utility of albumin adminis-
tration in preventing glycocalyx degradation in sepsis.
Several preclinical studies found that fresh frozen
plasma (FFP) had a protective effect on glycocalyx degrad-
ation in non-sepsis models. Kozar et al. [62] demonstrated
that FFP inhibited glycocalyx degradation in rats with
hemorrhagic shock compared to controls and lactate
ringer (LR). They also measured the levels of syndecan-1
mRNA extracted from lung tissue of hemorrhagic shock
rats. The syndecan-1 mean mRNA level was significantly
reduced in hemorrhagic shock (1.39 ± 0.22) compared to
control (3.03 ± 0.22, p < 0.02). They also found that the
mean level of syndecan-1 mRNA was significantly higher
in rats resuscitated with FFP (2.76 ± 0.03) than those re-
suscitated with LR (0.82 ± 0.03, p < 0.001). Others have re-
ported similar findings [63–65]. Conversely, Nelson et al.
[66] found no difference in the mean plasma level of
syndecan-1 and heparan sulfate in hemorrhagic shock
model rats resuscitated with FFP (n = 10), albumin (n = 9),
and Ringer’s acetate (RA; n = 9), after adjusting plasma
volume difference caused by FFP, albumin, and RA.
Straat et al. investigated the effects of FFP on glycoca-
lyx degradation in critical illness [67]. They compared
the median levels of plasma syndecan-1 before and after
FFP transfusion (12 ml/kg) in non-bleeding critically ill
patients (n = 33; 45% of their patients were septic). They
found the median level of syndecan-1 after FFP transfu-
sion was significantly lower than before FFP transfusion
(565 [IQR 127–1176] pg/mL vs 675 [IQR 132–1690] pg/
mL, p = 0.01). These data are provocative but clearly
further study is warranted.
Potential therapeutic options for inhibiting
glycocalyx degradation in sepsis
Several novel molecules are being investigated as pos-
sible glycocalyx-protective therapeutics. As described
above, S1P is a sphingolipid that may help improve gly-
cocalyx integrity by inhibiting syndecan-1 shedding. S1P
activates S1P1 receptor and the activation of S1P1 recep-
tor attenuates the activity of MMPs causing syndecan-1
ectodomain shedding [59]. One prior study reported that
serum S1P level is decreased in patients with sepsis and
septic shock and associated with sepsis severity [68].
Heparin is postulated to protect the glycocalyx from
degradation in sepsis by serving as an inhibitor of hepar-
anase, which sheds heparan sulfate from the endothelial
glycocalyx. A preclinical study reported that thinning of
glycocalyx layer in lung microvessels is due to heparan
sulfate
degradation
induced
by
TNF-α-dependent
heparanase activation; this was attenuated by heparin
treatment in a LPS murine model [18]. Since the activa-
tion of heparanase can increase the level of MMP
expression, heparin also may attenuate the increase of
MMP expression levels by inhibiting heparanase activity
[27]. Sulodexide (SDX), a highly purified extraction
product from porcine intestinal mucosa, has been simi-
larly reported to inhibit heparanase activity [69]. One
preclinical study by Song et al. [70] reported that SDX
treatment attenuated shedding of heparan sulfate and
syndecan-4 in a septic mouse model.
Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is a mediator of the
physiological repair of glycocalyx. It is rapidly activated
by circulating heparan sulfate fragments generated by
degradation of glycocalyx and binds to FGF receptor,
which conducts a signal for activating glycocalyx repair-
ing molecules such as exostosin-1, an enzyme respon-
sible for heparan sulfate synthesis. In sepsis, however,
this repair process is significantly delayed because the
signaling from activated FGF receptor is inhibited [71].
Enhancing this glycocalyx-repairing signal attenuated by
sepsis is a potential therapeutic approach to reconstitute
the glycocalyx layer and improve its function [72].
Conclusions
Glycocalyx degradation is gaining recognition as an im-
portant aspect of sepsis pathophysiology. Although the
mechanisms of degradation are not fully elucidated, the
increased plasma and urine levels of glycocalyx compo-
nents may serve as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers
in sepsis. Some studies have investigated components that
protect the glycocalyx from degradation, while others in-
vestigate the possibility of repair of a degraded glycocalyx.
The relationship between the degradation and fluid ther-
apy could yield other new insights into the prevention of
the degradation. Finally, given the emerging role of the
glycocalyx as a central part of sepsis pathophysiology, fur-
ther studies are needed to establish therapeutic strategies
to treat glycocalyx degradation in sepsis.
