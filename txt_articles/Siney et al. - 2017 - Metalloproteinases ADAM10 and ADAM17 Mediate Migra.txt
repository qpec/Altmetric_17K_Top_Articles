Abstract Glioblastoma is the most common form of primary
malignant brain tumour. These tumours are highly prolifera-
tive and infiltrative resulting in a median patient survival of
only 14 months from diagnosis. The current treatment regi-
mens are ineffective against the small population of cancer
stem cells residing in the tumourigenic niche; however, a
new therapeutic approach could involve the removal of these
cells from the microenvironment that maintains the cancer
stem cell phenotype. We have isolated multipotent sphere-
forming cells from human high grade glioma (glioma
sphere-forming cells (GSCs)) to investigate the adhesive and
migratory properties of these cells in vitro. We have focused
on the role of two closely related metalloproteinases
ADAM10 and ADAM17 due to their high expression in glio-
blastoma and GSCs and their ability to activate cytokines and
growth factors. Here, we report that ADAM10 and ADAM17
inhibition selectively increases GSC, but not neural stem cell,
migration and that the migrated GSCs exhibit a differentiated
phenotype. We also observed a correlation between nestin, a
stem/progenitor marker, and fibronectin, an extracellular ma-
trix protein, expression in high grade glioma tissues. GSCs
adherence on fibronectin is mediated by α5β1 integrin, where
fibronectin further promotes GSC migration and is an effec-
tive candidate for in vivo cancer stem cell migration out of the
tumourigenic niche. Our results suggest that therapies against
ADAM10 and ADAM17 may promote cancer stem cell mi-
gration away from the tumourigenic niche resulting in a dif-
ferentiated phenotype that is more susceptible to treatment.

Introduction
In recent years, there have been significant advances in cancer
therapy; survival rates for haematological and breast cancers,
for example, have improved dramatically, yet for the primary
brain tumour glioblastoma, median survival rate remains at
14 months from diagnosis.
This is partly due to the aggressive nature of these tumours
which are highly proliferative and invasive. First line treat-
ments of surgical resection, chemo- and radiotherapy fail to
prevent tumour recurrence within months giving weight to the
theory proposed by Singh and colleagues [1] that glioblastoma
is fuelled by cancer stem cells (CSCs) [2]. CSCs have similar
characteristics to neural stem cells (NSCs), but instead of pro-
ducing properly differentiated neural cell types, they produce
anaplastic clones that form the tumour mass.
A primary goal for glioblastoma research would be selec-
tive ablation of the CSC compartments; but in the absence of a
unique and highly specific marker for CSCs in glioblastoma,
this is not yet possible. Another approach would be to target
the nature of these CSCs and to alter or inhibit properties that
make them stem like and tumourigenic by in situ cell differ-
entiation to inhibit stem cell properties from CSCs [3].

 The role of the niche in tumour biology is increasingly
recognised with CSCs requiring an environment that supports
growth and maintains expression of genes necessary for self-
renewal. Expression of chemokines induces migration of
CSCs to the niche [4], and this process also requires degrada-
tion of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by proteinases. We,
along with others, have previously identified overexpression
of the metalloproteinases ADAM10 and ADAM17 in glio-
blastoma [5–7], where increased ADAM10 or ADAM17 ex-
pression correlates with poorer prognosis [8, 9]. These closely
related proteins are capable of growth factor and cytokine
processing; ADAM17 specifically cleaves TNFα (tumour ne-
crosis factor alpha) [10] a mediator of inflammation and tu-
mour initiation and potentiation [11], and ADAM10 sheds
epidermal growth factor (EGF) [12] a key player in cell pro-
liferation and survival whose receptor is mutated in approxi-
mately 50 % of glioblastoma cases. ADAM10 and ADAM17
are also important during development for glial cell migration
and can influence cell differentiation through cleavage of
Notch [13, 14].
Previous reports using commercial glioblastoma cell lines
suggest that ADAM10 and ADAM17 inhibition decrease tu-
mour growth and invasiveness [15, 16] but these do not spe-
cifically address the behaviour of the tumourigenic cells.
Here, we elucidate the specific role that these two metallopro-
teinases play in high grade glioma sphere-forming cell (GSC)
migration and differentiation. By isolating enriched stem cell
populations from human glioblastoma and inhibiting these
two proteins in in vitro cell migration models, we found for
the first time that ADAM10 and ADAM17 inhibition in-
creased migration in GSCs but not NSCs and that the migrated
cells are more differentiated compared to non-migrated cells.
Migration being linked to adhesion, we showed that GSC
adherence on fibronectin is mediated by α5β1 integrin, where
fibronectin further promotes GSC migration and is an effec-
tive candidate for in vivo cancer stem cell migration out of the
tumourigenic niche. Our new results suggest that ADAM10
and ADAM17 may be involved in retaining GSCs in the
tumourigenic niche in vivo.
Materials and Methods
Sample Collection and Cell Culture
Excised tumour from 12 high grade glioma patients (Table 1)
was collected into artificial CSF on ice then micro-dissected to
remove necrotic regions and major blood vessels. Remaining
tissue was digested in artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF) con-
taining hylauronidase, kinurenic acid and trypsin. Cells were
plated at 100 cells/μl in complete media: NeuroCult™ + supple-
ment (StemCell Technologies Ltd. #05702), 1 % antibiotics/
antimycotic, human fibroblastic growth factor-basic, (bFGF
10 ng/ml PeproTech #100-18B), human epidermal growth factor
(EGF 20 ng/ml PeproTech #100–15) and heparin (2 μg/ml
Sigma #3149) in 25-cm2 vented plastic flasks pre-coated with
25 μg/ml laminin (Sigma #L2020) and maintained at 37 °C, 5 %
CO2. At 24 h, the media was removed and discarded and remain-
ing adherent cells were transferred into fresh flasks without lam-
inin to allow clonal sphere formation. Samples were maintained
at 37 °C, 5 % CO2 and passaged at least three times before
assaying.
Inhibitors
To inhibit ADAM10 and ADAM17 in vitro, we used antibod-
ies against hADAM10 (Millipore #AB19026) and
hADAM17 (Calbiochem #PC491) and the non-specific
ADAM17 inhibitor TAPI-2 (Peptides International #INH-
3852-PI). Human recombinant ADAM17 (Calbiochem
#PF133) was used as a positive control. To screen integrin
subunit interactions, we used the α integrin blocking kit
(Millipore #ECM430), anti-β1 integrin (Abcam #24693)
and anti-β6 integrin [17] (gift from Gareth Thomas).
Sphere Formation
GSC spheres were dissociated and passed through a 40-μm
filter prior to adding into a 12-well plate at 5 × 103 cells per
well. Wells contained complete culture media with or without
blocking antibodies. At day 11, spheres >100 μm diameter
were counted with the average of triplicate wells being
reported.
Monolayer Cell Culture
GSC spheres were dissociated and passed through a 40-μm
filter prior to adding into a 48-well plate pre-coated with
25 μg/ml laminin (Sigma #L2020), human fibronectin (FN,
R&D systems #1918-FN-02M) or human vitronectin (VN,
R&D systems #2349-VN-100) at 5 × 103 cells per well in
complete media. These cultures were maintained at 37 °C,
5 % CO2 for 14 days with a 50 % media change at days 5
and 10.
Immunofluorescence
Excised tumours were collected into ACSF on ice; tissues
were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde, cryoprotected and sec-
tioned on a cryostat; cells were fixed in 4 % paraformalde-
hyde. Tissues and cells were permeabilised with 0.2 % Triton
X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Non-specific bind-
ing was blocked by 10 % donkey serum in permeabilisation
buffer. Cells and tissues were incubated with primary antibod-
ies: anti-hADAM10 (Millipore #AB19026), anti-hADAM17
(Calbiochem #PC491), anti-S100beta (Abcam #ab52642),
3894

 anti-laminin (Sigma #L9393), anti-fibronectin (AbdSerotec
#4470–4339), anti-vitronectin (Abcam #ab13413) and anti-
beta1 integrin (Abcam #ab24693) all at 1:100, anti-nestin
(Abcam #ab28944), anti-Sox2 (Y17) (Santa-Cruz #sc-
17320) and CD133/2 (Miltenyi Biotech #130-090-851) all at
1:200 and anti-beta-III-tubulin (Covance #mms-435p) at
1:500; and secondary antibodies are the following: anti-
rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 or anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 at
1:200 (Life Technologies). 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) was used for nuclear visualisation. Images were taken
using a fluorescent Leica DM IRBE microscope or a Leica
SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope, as indicated.
Enzyme Activity Test
ADAM17 protease activity of human recombinant ADAM17
(200 ng/ml Calbiochem #PF133) or G002 cell lysates (1 × 105
cells per well) were tested for their ability to cleave the fluo-
rescent substrate, MCA-KPLGL-Dpa-AR-NH2 using the
InnoZyme TACE activity kit (Calbiochem #CBA042). Cells
were lysed using a buffer containing 1 % NP-40 and no pro-
tease inhibitors. Cell lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min
with ADAM17 inhibitors; anti-ADAM17, TAPI-2 or control
IgG at (10 μg/ml) prior to following the manufacturer’s
protocol.
Transwell Migration Assays
Lower chambers were pre-incubated with or without attrac-
tants for 1 h at 37 °C then blocked with 0.1 % bovine serum
albumin (BSA) in serum-free media without growth factors
for 30 min. 5 × 104 cells were then added to the upper
transwell® chamber (Corning #3422). Transwell plates were
incubated at 37 °C, 5 % CO2 for 24 h. Cells of the lower
chambers were collected and counted using trypan blue on a
haemocytometer.
Sphere Spreading
Six to eight individual spheres (100 μm diameter) were placed
onto pre-coated wells with 25 μg/ml laminin (Sigma #L2020),
human fibronectin (FN, R&D systems #1918-FN-02 M) or
human vitronectin (VN, R&D systems #2349-VN-100),
containing complete media, 1 μM cytosine β-D-
arabinofuranoside (Ara-C, Sigma #C1768) and either 2 μg/
ml IgG isotype control (Cambridge Biosciences #400101),
0.2 μg/ml anti-ADAM10 (Millipore #AB19026), 2 μg/ml
anti-ADAM17 (Calbiochem #PC491) or anti-ADAM10 and
ADAM17 combined. Spheres were imaged from 0 to 45 h;
sphere area was calculated using Image J freehand tool.
Cell Adhesion Assays
96-well flat bottom plates were coated with fibronectin
(25 μg/ml) or 0.1 % BSA (non-specific adhesion control) for
1 h at 37 °C then blocked with 0.1 % BSA for 30 min. Cells
were dissociated, washed in serum free media, passed through
a 40-μm filter then incubated on ice with or without inhibitors
for 30 min. 2 × 104 cells were added to each well containing
serum free media +0.1 % BSA and incubated at 37 °C, 5 %
CO2 until non-specific binding occurred. Non-adhered cells
were removed by washing with PBS; adhered cells were fixed
with 1 % glutaraldehyde for 10 min then stained with 0.02 %
crystal violet. Cell adherence was calculated by colorimetric
analysis using Varioskan™ Flash (Thermo Scientific)

Flow Cytometry
Cells were collected and permeabilised in PBS + 1 % Tween-
20 for 5–10 min; non-specific binding was blocked with
PBS + 0.01 % BSA. Cells were incubated with fluorophore-
conjugated antibodies: anti-human βIII-tubulin-Alexa
Fluor647 (BDbiosciences #560394), anti-human nestin
Alexa Fluor488 (eBiosciences #53-9843-82), anti-
humanCD133/2-PE (Miltenyi Biotech #130-090-853) all at
1:333. Samples were run on FACSCanto I (BD Biosciences)
and analysed using the FACSDiva software.
Statistics
All statistical analyses were performed using Prism v.6
(GraphPad, Inc.) unless otherwise stated. Experiments were
carried out at a minimal of triplicate. Error bars indicate SEM
unless otherwise stated and significance results were reported
for P < 0.05.
Results
Using a first adherent culture step on laminin [18], we have
isolated a population of cells from glioblastoma tissues cul-
tured in serum-free conditions with mitogens to favour the
maintenance of stem/progenitor cells. These cultures exhibit
stem cell properties; they are capable of self-renewal over 20+
passages and can differentiate into immature neurons and as-
trocytes [5]. Although not a homogenous stem cell population,
these cultures reliably produce clonal spheres after dissocia-
tion (Fig. 1c) and are therefore termed glioma sphere-forming
cells (GSCs).
ADAM10 and ADAM17 Inhibition Increases GSC,
but not NSC, Directional Migration
Confirming previous results [19], we show that ADAM10 and
ADAM17 are expressed in GSCs (Fig. 1a) along with
colocalisation of ADAM10 and ADAM17 and nestin [5];
moreover, we have previously reported increased mRNA
levels in both glioblastoma tissues and corresponding cultured
spheres established from some of the same patient samples
used in the present study (including G002, G037, G049). To
validate the use of blocking antibodies, we demonstrated the
ability of specific ADAM10 and ADAM17 antibodies to in-
hibit the protease function of ADAM17 as a purified protein
[5] and we now show the ability of these antibodies to inhibit
the protease function of ADAM17 in GSC lysates from G002,
at levels comparable to the metalloproteinase inhibitor TAPI-2
(Fig. 1b).
As cells usually migrate in response to environmental cues,
we decided to find a suitable attractant for directional migration
by adding attractants into the lower chambers in transwell as-
says. The combination of mitogens used in culture (EGF, FGF
and heparin) was the most effective stimulus for both GSCs and
NSCs (Fig. 2a). This was thus used to test the effect of
ADAM10 and ADAM17 inhibition on cell migration
(Fig. 2b), as we checked that over the 24-h assay period, there
was no significant change in cell numbers when treated with the
ADAM blocking antibodies (Fig. 2c). In four GSC lines, mi-
gration increased twofold in the presence of anti-ADAM10 and
1.6-fold with anti-ADAM17 (Fig. 2b) but there was no signif-
icant change in the number of NSCs migrating into the lower
transwell chamber towards the mitogens. Combined ADAM10
and ADAM17inhibitiondecreasescell proliferation after 3 days
[5], and here, we found no effect on cell death over 24 h on the
same cell line (G002). Hence, the increase in number of cells in
the migration assay in four GSC lines is not due to changes in
cell proliferation or cell death but specifically to directional
migration of GSCs. We thus show here that inhibition of
ADAM10 and ADAM17 increases migration of GSCs.
Migrated GSCs Are More Differentiated than
Non-Migrated GSCs
Next, we compared the expression of stem cell and differen-
tiation markers in migrated vs. non- migrated cells. By sepa-
rating the two populations at 24 h in the transwell assay, we
found decreased expression of nestin and CD133 in the mi-
grated population from GSC lines along with increased ex-
pression of βIII-tubulin (Fig. 2d). The sphere formation po-
tential of these two populations was then assessed; the migrat-
ed population showed a 50 % reduction in the number of
spheres produced compared to non-migrated cells (Fig. 2e).
There was no significant differences in the size of the spheres
from migrated and non-migrated cells (data not shown), thus
excluding an effect of proliferation on this experiment. This
demonstrates on three lines that migrated cells are more dif-
ferentiated than non-migrated cells by upregulation of lineage
markers, downregulation of stem/progenitor markers and re-
duced sphere formation capability.
Extracellular Matrix Proteins Alter the Expression
of Differentiation Markers in GSCs
We then wanted to investigate candidate migratory substrates
available in the tumourigenic niche and to test the effect of
ADAM10 and ADAM17 inhibition on migration on these can-
didate substrates. We chose to focus on the basement membrane
proteins laminin and fibronectin, and vitronectin which has
been shown to be expressed at the leading edge of the tumour
3896
Mol Neurobiol (2017) 54:3893–3905
 [20], to elucidate their roles in GSC migration and differentiation.
Resected tissue from five patients were analysed (Fig. 3a). Both
laminin and fibronectin were detected in all five samples with
laminin expression being solely in distinct regions; fibronectin
was also observed in distinct regions (Fig. 3a, star) as well as
diffusely throughout the tissue (Fig. 3a, arrow), whereas
vitronectin was only expressed in 1/5 tissue samples. To investi-
gate if different ECMs could affect the phenotype of the GSCs,
we cultured isolated GSCs as monolayers on different ECMs for
14 days and found that the ECMs altered expression of stem/
lineage markers. Nearly 100 % of the cultured GSCs expressed
the stem/progenitor cell marker nestin on all ECMs; percentage
on fibronectin was significantly lower than on laminin and
vitronectin (Fig. 3b). For the astrocyte marker S100β, expression
was low in general and was significantly increased on both fi-
bronectin and vitronectin compared to laminin (Fig. 3c); whereas
for the neuronal marker βIII-tubulin, expression was low in
cells on laminin and fibronectin but higher on vitronectin
and significantly different between all three ECMs
(Fig. 3d). In summary, ECM proteins can affect cell differ-
entiated status; cells are less differentiated on laminin and
more differentiated on vitronectin and to a smaller extent
on fibronectin. We therefore wanted to assess the effect of
ECM proteins on GSC migration.
ADAM10 or ADAM17 Inhibition Increases Cell
Migration out of Tumourspheres on Three Different
ECMs
To analyse migration in a 3D model that may be more relevant
to the in vivo situation, we plated GSC-derived tumourspheres
onto ECM protein-coated wells containing the anti-mitotic
compound, cytosine β-D-arabinofuranoside (Ara-C), to block
cell proliferation as well as blocking antibodies or IgG control.

 We found that ADAM10 and ADAM17 inhibition had slight-
ly different effects depending on which ECM protein cells
were plated on, but overall, they increased migration of
GSCs out of tumourspheres, measured by an increased area
of the spheres (Fig. 4a–c). The mitogenic growth factor mix
used in culture medium was also included in the migration
media as it significantly increased cell migration out of the
sphere (Fig. 4d). This shows that inhibition of ADAM10

 and ADAM17 increases cell migration out of tumourspheres
plated on laminin, fibronectin and vitronectin.
To see if this in vitro observation correlated with the in vivo
situation, we looked for correlations between expression of
individual ECMs and cell phenotype in five different tissue
samples. Again, we used nestin, Sox2, βIII-tubulin and
S100β to assess the cell differentiation state and found all
tissues exhibited relatively high numbers of cells expressing
nestin and S100β, but low numbers of cells expressed βIII-
tubulin and Sox2, as expected for this type of tumour (Fig. 5a).
We then compared this to the expression of laminin, fibronec-
tin and vitronectin in the same five tissue samples and found a
significant correlation between fibronectin and nestin
(Fig. 5b). This suggests that ECM and fibronectin in particular
might be involved in GSC migration.
ADAM10 and ADAM17 Inhibition Increases GSC
Migration Towards Fibronectin
Based on its expression pattern, effect on differentiation markers
and correlation with stem/progenitor marker, we focused on
fibronectin in further experiments using one of the GSC lines
(G100). We first compared the effectiveness of fibronectin
against laminin and vitronectin for the ability to induce GSC
haptotactic migration by coating the underside of the transwell
membrane with laminin, fibronectin or vitronectin. All three
ECMs were effective haptotactic stimuli for GSCs, in the ab-
sence of mitogens, with laminin and fibronectin being the most
effective confirming that fibronectin is a suitable in vitro sub-
strate for GSC migration (Fig. 5c). We then used fibronectin as
the migration substrate during ADAM10 and ADAM17 inhibi-
tion and found that fibronectin mediated directional migration of
GSCs was increased during ADAM10 and ADAM17 blockade
(Fig. 5d). We have shown here that ADAM10 and ADAM17
inhibition increase GSC migration through fibronectin.
GSC Adhesion to Fibronectin Is Mediated by Integrin
α5β1
To migrate, cells must adhere to surrounding substrates and this
process involves integrins. We screened blocking antibodies to
α and β integrin subunits and found that α5β1, the classical
fibronectin receptor, mediates adhesion of GSCs to fibronectin
(Fig. 6a, b). β1 integrin is expressed in GSCs (Fig. 6c, d) in
which the blocking antibody consistently reduced cell adhesion
by 25 % (Fig. 6b, e, f). We further investigated GSC adhesion to
fibronectin and found that ADAM10 and ADAM17 inhibition
or exogenous recombinant ADAM10 and ADAM17 had no
significant effect on this process (Fig. 6e, P = 0.1193, Fig. 6F,
P = 0.1110), but when adding anti-ADAM10 and ADAM17 or

 exogenous recombinant human (rh) ADAM10 and
ADAM17, β1 integrin inhibition no longer significantly
reduces cell adhesion (Fig. 6e, f). This suggests that β1
integrin interacts with ADAM10 and ADAM17 and that
its effect is blocked by ADAM10 and ADAM17 blocking
antibodies or exogenous ADAM10 and ADAM17.
Discussion
A major hurdle in glioblastoma treatment is the difficulty of
complete surgical resection due to the diffuse nature of the
tumour, which invariably results in tumour recurrence.
Altering cell migration/invasion, especially in the tumour ini-
tiating cells, would act to constrain the tumour mass and/or
remove the tumour initiating cells from their niche, thereby
increasing the efficacy of resection. We investigated whether
ADAM10 and ADAM17 have a role in this process.
Cell migration in the brain is a carefully orchestrated pro-
cess involving precision-timed attractant and repellent signal-
ling along with many structural components. We used the
transwell migration system to assess directional migration to-
wards different chemoattractants, and the greatest stimulus
was provided by the combination of growth factors which
are included in the GSC maintenance media.

Image J. Cell migration out of the
sphere was calculated as ((t-

give percent increase in sphere
area. a Phase contrast images of

 When using growth factors as a stimulus, anti-ADAM10 or
anti-ADAM17 significantly increased GSC migration, but this
was not true for NSCs suggesting an inherent difference in
cellular response to metalloproteinase inhibition between tu-
mour and non-tumour stem cells. This suggests that ADAM10
and ADAM17 are important components of the tumourigenic
niche which function to retain cancer stem cells in this niche,
promoting self-renewal and tumour recurrence. GSCs have not
only increased expression of ADAMs compared to NSCs [5]
but also elevated receptor tyrosine kinases whose ligands are
shed by ADAM10 and ADAM17, in particular EGFR, which
is often upregulated in glioblastoma [21–24]. Increased
ADAM expression can result in greater growth factor and
cytokine processing [25–27], conversely in mouse embryonic
fibroblasts; knockdown of ADAM10 ablated EGF shedding
[12] which suggests that in our experimental settings, EGF
processing may also be reduced.
GSCs may have a higher dependence on growth factors than
NSCs and so inhibition of ADAM10 and ADAM17 to reduce
endogenous growth factors could stimulate migration of GSCs
to an area of higher growth factor concentration (i.e. the lower
transwell chamber). This theory would also explain the migra-
tion of cells out of tumourspheres where the removal of growth
factors from the surrounding media was found to significantly
slowdown migration. Again ADAM10 and ADAM17 inhibi-
tion, which would reduce local growth factor concentrations,

 promoted the migration of GSCs into the growth factor con-
taining media. Mitogenic growth factors such as EGF would be
expected to be vital components of the tumourigenic niche
acting to maintain self-renewal and also as chemoattractants
to retain or even home stem cells to the niche.
As ADAM10 and ADAM17 are overexpressed in glioblas-
toma where they can act to increase the EGF concentration in
the niche then anti-ADAM10 and ADAM17 treatment may
mediate migration out of the niche by reducing local EGF
concentrations.
Chen et al. analysed migration in the human glioblastoma cell
line U87 cultured in serum using matrigel-coated transwell and
showed a decrease of migration when ADAM17 was inhibited
[28]. Similarly, Zheng et al. showed a decrease in invasive prop-
erties of the human glioblastoma cell line U87 over 24 h of
ADAM17 inhibition, using matrigel-coated transwell with serum
in the lower chamber and analysing the number of cells on the
underside of the membrane [29]. We found that many cells had
detached from the underside of the transwell membrane into the
lower chamber and so counted the total cell number in the lower
chamber which may account for the difference in results.
Moreover, our cells are low passage sphere-forming cell popula-
tions from high grade gliomas, cultured without serum, and so
are likely to exhibit a different phenotype from the U87 cells
cultured with differentiation promoting serum.
Over 24 h, ADAM10 and ADAM17 inhibition increased
GSC migration and the migrated cells had started to differentiate
and loose the stem cell phenotype. ADAM10 and ADAM17 can
influence cell fate through Notch processing [30, 31], yet ADAM
inhibition did not significantly alter the expression of differenti-
ation markers between migrated cells and non-migrated cells
(data not shown); this may be due to the short time period in

 which the cells were exposed to the ADAM10 and ADAM17
blocking antibodies. Indeed, we and others found that ADAM10
and ADAM17 inhibition increased neuronal marker βIII-tubulin
expression over a week in differentiation culture conditions and
promoted asymmetrical division giving rise to neuronal progen-
itors [5, 31, 32]. A negative correlation has been found in glio-
blastoma between the genetic signature of the epithelial-to-
mesenchymal transition (EMT) and that of CD133 [33], suggest-
ing that ADAM10 and ADAM17 inhibition might activate the
transition, differentiating the cells and increasing cell migration
and invasion.
In further assessment of GSC differentiation, we investigat-
ed the contribution of ECMs to the stem cell phenotype.
Laminin is a useful tool for isolation of GSCs from glioblas-
toma tissues [18]; we have shown that low passage GSCs
plated on laminin exhibit high expression of stem/progenitor
cell marker with minimal differentiation along glial and neu-
ronal lineages at day 14 suggesting laminin is capable of
maintaining the stem cell phenotype. Laminin also maintains
cells in an undifferentiated state better than fibronectin and
vitronectin, the latter being the most permissive to cell
differentiation.
All three ECMs are effective haptotactic substrates for
GSC migration, but are they all involved in glioblastoma in-
vasion? Laminin is a component of the perivascular niche
[34], but it is unlikely to be the substrate for migration
throughout the brain as its expression is restricted to basement
membranes [35, 36]). Vitronectin is a possible candidate as it
is expressed at the leading edge of the tumour [20] but is
unlikely to be the only one, as we found, it is only expressed
in 20 % of our samples. In comparison, as fibronectin is found
around blood vessels and diffuse throughout the tissue [37], it
provides the best migratory route from the perivascular niche
out into the brain parenchyma. Moreover, glioblastoma cells
have been found to migrate along fibronectin positive tracts in
the rat brain [38]. We show here a positive correlation between
stem/progenitor cells and fibronectin in high grade glioma
tissues, as well as an increase in GSC migration through fi-
bronectin during ADAM10 and ADAM17 inhibition, as pre-
viously shown with renal cancer cells [39]. To better under-
stand the effect of the blocking antibodies on this migration,
we investigated the disintegrin function of ADAM10 and
ADAM17 during GSC adhesion to fibronectin. The
disintegrin domain of ADAM10 and ADAM17 is not homol-
ogous to the other ADAM family members and is likely to
bind different proteins.
Integrin subunit screening detected that α5β1 integrins are
required for GSC adhesion to fibronectin; ADAM17 is known
to bind to this integrin in vitro [40, 41], and we showed that
blocking α5 or β1 decreased adhesion of GSC to fibronectin.
Addition of exogenous rhADAM10 and ADAM17 had the
same effect as ADAM10 and ADAM17 blocking antibodies
suggesting that the proteinase function of ADAMs is not
involved in cell adhesion. Any effect is more likely due to
direct interaction between ADAMs and integrins. When the
recombinant protein or blocking antibodies are present, β1
integrin blockade no longer decreases cell adhesion suggest-
ing there may be disruption of ADAM interaction with
integrins either by ADAM10 and ADAM17 blocking antibod-
ies preventing interaction or by rhADAM10 and ADAM17
blocking binding sites on the integrin. Even though ADAM
inhibition did not alter GSC adhesion to fibronectin over 1.5 h,
migration is equilibrium between adhesion and detachment,
and an effect through the disintegrin domain cannot be exclud-
ed and could still account for the increased cell migration
observed during ADAM10 and ADAM17 blockade.
Although TAPI-2 is a commonly used inhibitor of
ADAM17, it is not specific to ADAM17 and can also inhibit
matrix metalloproteinases or MMPs. We therefore chose
blocking antibodies to specifically inhibit ADAM10 or
ADAM17. We confirmed the efficacy of anti-ADAM17 to
inhibit ADAM17 proteinase activity using purified recombi-
nant ADAM17 and non-purified GSC lysates, at similar levels
as TAPI-2. Although the anti-ADAM17 significantly de-
creased ADAM17 activity in both situations, it was less effi-
cient in the GSC lysates suggesting that ADAM17 collected
from GSCs might bind other proteins and the blocking anti-
body may not efficiently compete for the binding site.
We have shown for the first time that growth factors and
ECMs are effective stimuli for GSC migration and that they
are likely to be important components of the tumourigenic
niche in the brain where they can support the stem cell phe-
notype. As ADAM inhibition increases GSC migration,
ADAM10 and ADAM17 may also be key components of this
niche where they act to retain cells in the tumourigenic envi-
ronment in an undifferentiated state. Although blocking
ADAM10 and ADAM17 may increase GSC invasion
in vivo, if the migrating cells are differentiating, they will lose
stem cell characteristics; this will be compounded by the fact
they are also moving away from the niche environment that
supports stemness, creating a feed forward process. In combi-
nation with ADAM10 and ADAM17 inhibition decreasing
GSC proliferation, these new therapeutic targets may provide
a mechanism for depletion of the tumourigenic stem cell pool
that seeds the tumour whilst sparing native neural stem cells.
