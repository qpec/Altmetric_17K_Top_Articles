ABSTRACT: Secreted and surface-displayed carbohydrates are essen-
tial for virulence and viability of many parasites, including for immune
system evasion. We have identified the α-Gal trisaccharide epitope on
the surface of the protozoan parasites Leishmania infantum and
Leishmania amazonensis, the etiological agents of visceral and cutaneous
leishmaniasis, respectively, with the latter bearing larger amounts of α-
Gal than the former. A polyvalent α-Gal conjugate on the immunogenic
Qβ virus-like particle was tested as a vaccine against Leishmania infection
in a C57BL/6 α-galactosyltransferase knockout mouse model, which
mimics human hosts in producing high titers of anti-α-Gal antibodies. As
expected, α-Gal-T knockout mice infected with promastigotes of both
Leishmania species showed significantly lower parasite load in the liver
and slightly decreased levels in the spleen, compared with wild-type
mice. Vaccination with Qβ−α-Gal nanoparticles protected the knockout
mice against Leishmania challenge, eliminating the infection and proliferation of parasites in the liver and spleen as probed by
qPCR. The α-Gal epitope may therefore be considered as a vaccine candidate to block human cutaneous and visceral
leishmaniasis.
L
eishmaniasis, a major human health problem endemic in
more than 88 countries, is spread by minute insects called
sand flies, which regurgitate the parasite into the skin of their
vertebrate hosts.1 Leishmania species cause a spectrum of
clinical symptoms2,3 depending on the nature of the infecting
strain and its interaction with the host immune system and
other genetic factors.4 In Mediterranean and South American
countries, cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in humans is caused
primarily by L. mexicana, L. amazonensis, and L. braziliensis, all
of which induce ulcers localized to the skin. L. amazonensis is
also responsible for diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis, whereas L.
braziliensis, in some circumstances, may cause lesions in
mucosal surfaces. Leishmania infantum (in Europe, North
Africa, and Latin America) and Leishmania donovani (in East
Africa and the Indian subcontinent) are the causative agents of
visceral leishmaniasis (VL),5 in which the parasite spreads to
internal organs and can be lethal if not treated.6,7
The carbohydrate-rich molecules found on the surface of
Leishmania parasites include lipophosphoglycans, glycosylphos-
phatidylinositol-anchored proteins, glycosylphosphatidylinosi-
tol lipids, and proteophosphoglycans.8 These glycoproteins are
part of the glycocalyx of the promastigote infective form,
playing an important role in infectivity9,10 and sand fly
interaction.11 After transmission by blood-feeding sand flies of
the genus Lutzomyia (in the New World), metacyclic
Leishmania parasites interact primarily with phagocytic cells
and then may be distributed to their resident tissues and
organs, depending of the Leishmania species. While carbohy-
drates present on the parasite surface are likely to play an
important role in mediating cell host adhesion,12 the molecular
mechanism of virulence of this parasitic disease is poorly
understood.
Among the most interesting pathogen-related carbohydrates
is the α-Gal epitope, a name given to both the Gal-α1,3-Gal
disaccharide13 and the Gal-α1,3-Gal-β1,4-GlcNAc trisacchar-
ide;14 we use the latter designation here. Recently, high levels of
anti-α-Gal antibodies were detected in cured patients with
cutaneous leishmaniasis,15 raising the possibility that this highly
immunogenic16,17 structure could be present on the parasite

 surface, stimulating anti-α-Gal antibody production beyond the
levels normally present in healthy individuals.14,18 We describe
here the identification of the α-Gal epitope on the promastigote
form of Leishmania amazonensis and Leishmania infantum, the
use of the α-galactosyltransferase knockout mouse (αGalT-
KO) of Thall and colleagues19 as a murine model for
leishmaniasis, and a polyvalent α-Gal conjugate as an effective
vaccine candidate against parasite infection in this model. Since
only humans and higher apes among all mammals lack the α-
galactosyltransferase gene,20 the αGalT-KO mouse mimics the
human immune system’s ability to generate anti-α-Gal
antibodies to a much greater degree than wild-type rodents.
These mice have been used primarily in studies of xenotrans-
plant rejection and fertilization,21,22 but are also of great
potential interest for studies of any pathogen that displays α-
Gal.
To see if Leishmania falls into this category, we investigated
the presence of the α-Gal epitope on the promastigote forms of
L. infantum (MCAN/BR/2002/BH401) and L. amazonensis
(IFLA/BR/1967/PH8). The Marasmius oreades agglutinin
(MOA) lectin, which binds strongly to the α-Gal trisaccharide,
the related type B branched trisaccharide, and the Gal-α1,3-Gal
disaccharide (but not the isomeric α1,2-α1,4- and α1,6-
disaccharides),23,24 was used as the key reagent for these
studies. Promastigote cells (108 per mL) of L. infantum and L.
amazonensis were labeled with 3−5 μg/mL of fluorescein-

 labeled MOA and examined by fluorescence microscopy25 and
flow cytometry.26 Strong staining of the L. amazonensis cell
surface, compared to moderate staining of L. infantum, was
observed (Figure 1A,B), which was confirmed by flow
cytometry (Figure 1C,D). The addition of a large excess (0.2
M) of galactose largely abrogated binding, as expected. Lastly,
L. amazonensis and L. infantum lysates were plated and
incubated either with biotinylated MOA or purified anti-α-
Gal antibody in an ELISA-type assay (Figure 1E).27 As before,
the presence of α-Gal was confirmed for both species, but to a
greater degree for L. amazonensis. Preincubation with an α-
galactosidase enzyme reduced binding by more than 90%
(Figure 1F), showing that the terminal galactose residue is
critical. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence
that both L. infantum and L. amazonensis express the α-Gal
epitope on their surfaces, the latter in greater amount or
accessibility.
In visceral leishmaniasis, caused by L. infantum, parasites are
able to escape from the host immune system and reach internal
organs such as liver or spleen, whereas in cutaneous
leishmaniasis L. amazonensis usually stay at the site of the
infection. C57BL/6 mice have been used to study pathogenesis
of experimental cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis.28
However, in spite of intense effort with this model, greater
consistency is needed, particularly over multiple Leishmania
strains and numbers of parasites used for infection. The
presence of α-Gal on the parasite makes these experiments
even less reliable as an indicator of the human response since α-
Gal is a self sugar in these wild-type C57BL/6 mice.
We therefore compared the response of α-GalT-KO vs α-
GalT-WT mice to intraperitoneal infection with 107 promas-
tigotes of L. infantum and subcutaneously with the same
number of L. amazonensis. Blood samples for ELISA were
collected at days 7, 14, and 21; liver and spleen samples were
collected for quantitative PCR (qPCR) 10 weeks postinfection.
The Leishmania-infected α-GalT-WT produced levels of anti-α-
Gal antibodies identical to uninfected controls, representing a
negligible response against the α-Gal epitope (Figure 2A). In
contrast, α-GalT-KO infected mice produced anti-α-Gal
antibodies to a moderate extent, significantly greater than
noninfected controls (Figure 2B). Infection with L. amazonensis
induced a more intense anti-α-Gal response, consistent with its
higher level of α-Gal display. Parasite loads in liver and spleen
were assessed by qPCR, with significantly greater variability for
α-GalT-WT mice than α-GalT-KO mice. Differences in liver
infection at 10 weeks were not significant for either Leishmania
strain between the two mouse models (p > 0.05, Figure 2C,E),
but both parasites were found in the spleens of α-GalT-WT
mice to a significantly greater extent than α-GalT-KO mice
(Figure 2D,F).
These findings suggested that α-GalT-KO mice were more
resistant than α-GalT-WT toward Leishmania infection,
perhaps because of the anti-α-Gal antibodies produced by the
knockout animals. The highly variable nature of the response of
WT mice (panels C, D, E, F) is to be expected given the many
factors that contribute to the extent of infection in the absence
of a controlling factor, including parasite dissemination from
the site of injection and the draining lymph nodes to other
organs.29−32 To further test the proposed role of an induced
anti-α-Gal immune response, we immunized both mouse
strains with the previously reported33,34 Qβ virus-like particle
bearing approximately 540 copies of the α-Gal trisaccharide,
designated Qβ−α-Gal. We hoped that high anti-α-Gal antibody
levels would be generated against the glycoconjugate, and that
this response would protect these mice more effectively from
Leishmania infection. The immunization protocol is shown in
Figure 3A, in which groups of mice were immunized with 10 μg
Qβ−α-Gal particles (containing approximately 1 μg of attached
α-Gal) and boosted twice (at one-week intervals) with the same
dose.
The immune response of these animals compared to
nonimmunized control mice was assessed by ELISA against
two reagents: the Qβ−α-Gal immunogen and an analogous
particle (Qβ-Glc) bearing glucose moieties (approximately 500

 per particle) in place of α-Gal. As shown in Figure 3B, the
immunized α-GalT-KO mice produced a strong IgG anti-α-Gal
response, whereas α-GalT-WT gave no such response above
background. The immune response against the carrier Qβ
protein was not independently assessed, but is unlikely to have
contributed significantly to the results, as evidenced by the
modest intensities of ELISA signals against Qβ-Glc (Figure
3D). As expected, nonimmunized mice showed no IgG
antibodies against Qβ−α-Gal or Qβ-Glc particles (Figure
3C,E).
Following vaccination as above with Qβ−α-Gal (immuniza-
tion + two boosts), groups of 3−5 mice were assessed for anti-
α-Gal antibody production (Figure 4B) and then were infected
with 107 L. amazonensis or L. infantum by the appropriate route.
Ten weeks later, the animals were sacrificed and qPCR was
performed on samples collected from liver and spleen from all
groups. Parasite loads in both organs were found to be
undetectable, or nearly so, for all vaccinated and infected α-
GalT-KO mice, whereas the unvaccinated mice all harbored the
parasite, in widely varying amounts (Figure 4C−D). Prelimi-
nary tests showed no difference between unvaccinated mice and
mice immunized with Qβ-Glc in Leishmania challenge (data
not shown).
■ CONCLUSIONS
Carbohydrates present on the surface of the Leishmania parasite
have been proposed to accomplish several functions, many of
which contribute to immune system evasion and patho-
genesis.9,10 Since the α-Gal epitope has been found on many
pathogens including organisms related to Leishmania, and since
an α-Gal immune response had recently been found in
Leishmania patients, we looked for and found evidence of α-
Gal on two representative Leishmania species.
Antibodies against α-Gal have been reported to protect
against experimental malaria infection,35 assist in the healing of
burn wounds,36 improve immunogenicity in HIV vaccination,37
show lytic action against Trypanosoma cruzi parasites,38 and
enhance immunogenicity in anticancer vaccine development.16
These diverse functions show that the anti-α-Gal immune
response, while strong in all healthy humans, is also more
complex than may be commonly appreciated. To study this for
Leishmania, the α-galactosyltransferase knockout mouse can be
a useful tool. Indeed, we showed here that these animals are
susceptible to immunization against causative organisms of
cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis with a conjugate vaccine
that presents only the α-Gal carbohydrate in common with the
parasites.
■ METHODS
Details of the handling of Leishmania samples, extract
preparation, ELISA, Qβ virus-like particle preparation, qPCR,
and immunization are provided in Supporting Information.
Virus-like Particles. Qβ virus-like particles (of “wild type”
sequence) were prepared, purified,39 chemically derivatized,34
and characterized as previously described.
Mice. All animals and experiments were handled in strict
accordance with the guidelines of the Research Ethics
Committee of the UFMG, approved under the protocol
number 137/2011. Female C57BL/6 mice (6−8 weeks old)
having disrupted alleles of the α1,3-GalT gene19 (α1,3GalT-
KO) were used. These mice have the H-2b genetic background
and are bred and maintained at the animal facility of Federal
University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.
Fluorescence Microscopy and Flow Cytometry. Cells
were fixed for 40 min in 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mM
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and washed three times in
phosphate buffer at 4 °C for 15 min. Cells were then labeled
with 3−5 μg/mL of MOA lectin-fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC) for 60 min, washed, mounted on slides with Mowiol
reagent (DABCO, Sigma a 2,3%), and observed using a
fluorescent Nikon Eclipse Ti, (USA), with fluorescence
illumination and a FITC filter-barrier system. Pictures were

 taken with Kodak Tri-X pan 400 ASA film. Lectins conjugated
with FITC were obtained from EY laboratories, San Mateo, CA.
Fluorescent signals were quantified using a Becton Dickinson
FACScan (Becton Dickinson), excitation 488 nm, emission 530
nm (±15 nm), adjusted to a fixed channel using standard Brite
Beads (Coulter) prior to determining fluorescence. Samples
were briefly vortexed before introduction to sheath fluid. Data
acquisition and manipulation were performed with CellQuest
and FlowJo version X.0.7 (Tree Star Inc.). Lectin binding was
blocked by the addition of 0.2 M galactose to verify specificity.
Mice Immunization for Antibody Detection. We
initially verified the competence of α1,3-GalT-KO mice,
previously immunized, to produce antibodies (primarily IgG)
against α-Gal epitopes. Immunization was performed in groups
of 13 mice by subcutaneous injection of 10 μg doses of Qβ−α-
Gal or unmodified Qβ particle at the base of the tail (not
injection into the tail vein), followed by subcutaneous boost
injections of the same dose at 1 week intervals in the flank. A
control group of 13 mice was similarly treated with unmodified
Qβ virus-like particle.
Only α-GalT-KO mice were used for vaccination and parasite
challenge given the tolerance of α-GalT-WT mice to α-Gal
epitopes.40 Groups of 3−5 female α-GalT-KO mice were
immunized (initial and two boost injections) as described
above; control groups received PBS only. One week after the
third injection, serum antibody levels were checked by ELISA.
Each each animal was then challenged with 107 Leishmania
parasites prepared as described in Supporting Information: L.
amazonensis, MCAN/BR/2002/BH401, causing cutaneous
leishmaniasis, so injected into the footpad in 10 μL volume
and L. infantum, MCAN/BR/2002/BH401, causing visceral
leishmaniasis, so injected i.p. in 200 μL volume.
