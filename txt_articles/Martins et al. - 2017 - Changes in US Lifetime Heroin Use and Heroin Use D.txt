IMPORTANCE Heroin use is an urgent concern in the United States. Little is know about the
course of heroin use, heroin use disorder, and associated factors.
OBJECTIVE To examine changes in the lifetime prevalence, patterns, and associated
demographics of heroin use and use disorder from 2001-2002 to 2012-2013 in 2 nationally
representative samples of the US adult general population.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This survey study included data from 43 093
respondents of the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related
Conditions (NESARC) and 36 309 respondents of the 2012-2013 NESARC-III. Data were
analyzed from February 2 to September 15, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Lifetime heroin use and DSM-IV heroin use disorder.
RESULTS Among the 79 402 respondents (43.3% men; 56.7% women; mean [SD] age,
46.1 [17.9] years), prevalence of heroin use and heroin use disorder significantly increased
from 2001-2002 to 2012-2013 (use: 0.33% [SE, 0.03%] vs 1.6% [SE, 0.08%]; disorder:
0.21% [SE, 0.03%] vs 0.69% [SE, 0.06%]; P < .001). The increase in the prevalence of heroin
use was significantly pronounced among white (0.34% [SE, 0.04%] in 2001-2002 vs 1.90%
[SE, 0.12%] in 2012-2013) compared with nonwhite (0.32% [SE, 0.05%] in 2001-2002 vs
1.05% [SE, 0.10%] in 2012-2013; P < .001) individuals. The increase in the prevalence of
heroin use disorder was more pronounced among white individuals (0.19% [SE, 0.03%] in
2001-2002 vs 0.82% [SE, 0.08%] in 2012-2013; P < .001) and those aged 18 to 29 (0.21%
[SE, 0.06%] in 2001-2002 vs 1.0% [0.17%] in 2012-2013; P = .01) and 30 to 44 (0.20% [SE,
0.04%] in 2001-2002 vs 0.77% [0.10%] in 2012-2013; P = .03) years than among nonwhite
individuals (0.25% [SE, 0.04%] in 2001-2002 vs 0.43% [0.07%] in 2012-2013) and older
adults (0.22% [SE, 0.04%] in 2001-2002 vs 0.51% [SE, 0.07%] in 2012-2013). Among users,
significant differences were found across time in the proportion of respondents meeting
DSM-IV heroin use disorder criteria (63.35% [SE, 4.79%] in 2001-2001 vs 42.69% [SE,
2.87%] in 2012-2013; P < .001). DSM-IV heroin abuse was significantly more prevalent among
users in 2001-2002 (37.02% [SE, 4.67%]) than in 2012-2013 (19.19% [SE, 2.34%]; P = .001).
DSM-IV heroin dependence among users was similar in 2001-2002 (28.22% [SE, 3.95%]) and
in 2012-2013 (25.02% [SE, 2.20%]; P = .48). The proportion of those reporting initiation of
nonmedical use of prescription opioids before initiating heroin use increased across time
among white individuals (35.83% [SE, 6.03%] in 2001-2002 to 52.83% [SE, 2.88%] in
2012-2013; P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The prevalence of heroin use and heroin use disorder
increased significantly, with greater increases among white individuals. The nonmedical use
of prescription opioids preceding heroin use increased among white individuals, supporting
a link between the prescription opioid epidemic and heroin use in this population. Findings
highlight the need for educational campaigns regarding harms related to heroin use and the
need to expand access to treatment in populations at increased risk for heroin use and heroin
use disorder.

eroin is an urgent concern in the United States.1,2 Risks
associated with heroin use and addiction include
mortality,3,4 overdose,1,5,6 infectious diseases,1,7 and
impaired psychological status and social relationships.8 In-
creases in serious consequences of heroin use, including
overdoses,9 emergency department visits,10 and public drug
abuse treatment,11 have led to widespread concerns about a
heroin epidemic.6 Although studies have addressed the link
between use of prescription opioids (POs) and heroin,1,2,12-15
most information on trends in US adult heroin use is indirect,
obtained through studies of its sequelae.10,11
Studies of trends in the consequences of heroin use, such
asoverdoses,areimportant.However,thesestudiesdonotpro-
vide information about underlying trends in the population
burdens of heroin use and related disorders in US adults or in
the characteristics and patterns of use among heroin users. For
suchtrends,nationalsurveydataareneeded.TheNationalSur-
vey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) is a potential source of
such information. However, other than brief summaries,1,16,17
little has been published from NSDUH on trends in heroin use.
Apart from the NSDUH, no studies known to us have ad-
dressed time trends in heroin consumption among US repre-
sentative samples, including change over time in the preva-
lence of lifetime heroin use and heroin use disorders overall
or patterns and characteristics of heroin use and related dis-
orders among users (eg, age at onset, use frequency, disorder
severity, types of abuse, or dependence symptoms en-
dorsed). Using US adult national surveys conducted during
2001-2002 and 2012-2013, we addressed the following ques-
tions. First, did prevalence of lifetime heroin use and related
disorders increase? Second, did demographic characteristics
associated with lifetime heroin use and heroin use disorders
change? Third, did patterns, severity, and substance comor-
bidity of heroin use and related disorders change?
Methods
Study Design and Participants
We obtained data from the following 2 nationally representa-
tiveface-to-facehouseholdsurveysofadults18yearsandolder
residing in households and group quarters18,19: the 2001-
2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related
Conditions(NESARC)(n = 43 093),andthe2012-2013NESARC-
III (n = 36 309). NESARC and NESARC-III used similar multi-
stage probability sampling designs with oversampling for His-
panic, black, and (in NESARC-III) Asian individuals.19-21 Survey
weights were used to adjust for differential probabilities of par-
ticipant selection and household and person-level nonre-
sponse and adjusted sample margins to match key demo-
graphic distributions (eg, age, sex, and race) of each target
population.19,22 NESARC and NESARC-III used computer-
assisted interviews and highly trained interviewers. Re-
sponse rates in NESARC (60.1%) and NESARC-III (81.0%) were
comparable to those of other national surveys.23,24 Inter-
viewer quality assurance methods were similar across
surveys.22 The US Census Bureau and US Office of Manage-
ment and Budget conducted a full ethical review and ap-
proved all protocols and study consent procedures for 2001-
2002 NESARC. The 2012-2013 NESARC-III protocols and study
consent procedures were approved by the institutional re-
view boards of Westat and the National Institutes of Health.
Respondents gave written informed consent and were com-
pensated for participation.
Assessments
Heroin Use and DSM-IV Use Disorder
The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Al-
coholUseDisorderandAssociatedDisabilitiesInterviewSched-
ule IV (AUDADIS-IV), a fully structured diagnostic interview
designed for use by nonclinician interviewers after struc-
tured training, was used to assess substance use and psychi-
atric disorders according to DSM-IV criteria. In NESARC-III, the
AUDADIS-5wasusedtoassesssubstanceuseandDSM-IV25and
DSM-526 criteria for substance use disorders.
Lifetime heroin use (ever vs never used heroin) was mea-
sured in both surveys and was included as a binary (yes or
no) variable in our analyses. The reliability and validity of
AUDADIS DSM-IV substance use disorder diagnoses have been
well documented.27-40 We combined abuse and dependence
because the criteria reflect a single disorder rather than 2
conditions.41 Symptom items (n = 30) that assessed DSM-IV
heroin use disorder (abuse and dependence) in the NESARC
andNESARC-IIIwerevirtuallyidentical.However,4itemswere
slightly reworded and 1 abuse item appeared in the NESARC
but not the NESARC-III, whereas a different abuse item ap-
peared in the NESARC-III but not the NESARC. Comparisons
between DSM-IV heroin use disorder diagnoses with and with-
out the additional questions yielded virtually identical preva-
lences (NESARC: 0.69% vs 0.68%; NESARC-III: 0.21% vs
0.21%), with corresponding near perfect or perfect concor-
dance (κ = 0.998 and κ = 1.00, respectively), suggesting that
these trivial differences could not account for the substantial
differences in prevalence between the surveys.
Patterns of Heroin Use
Variablesincludedageatfirstuse,periodofuse(beforethepast
12 months only, past 12 months only, or both periods) and fre-
quency of use during the heaviest-use period (every day or
Key Points
Question Did a change occur in the prevalence, course, and
associated demographics of heroin use and heroin use disorder
from 2001-2002 to 2012-2013?
Findings In this population-based survey study of 79 402
respondents, the prevalence of heroin use (1.61% vs 0.33%) and
related disorder (0.69% vs 0.21%) was significantly higher in
2012-2013 than in 2001-2002, with greater increases among
white individuals. The proportion of individuals reporting initiation
of nonmedical use of prescription opioids before heroin use
increased across time among white users only.
Meaning The use of prescription opioids may have contributed to
the greater increase in the prevalence of heroin use and related
disorder observed among white individuals.

 nearly every day or other). Heroin use disorder included use
disorder overall, abuse, dependence, the abuse and depen-
dence criteria, driving under the influence of heroin, and
the number of lifetime heroin disorder criteria (0-1, 2-3, 4-5,
and ≥6).
Other Substance Use
Lifetime use of other substances (sedatives or tranquilizers,
stimulants, marijuana, cocaine or crack, hallucinogens, inhal-
ants, POs, and other substances) on one’
s own was included
and measured identically across surveys. Because PO use is of
special interest, we created a variable indicating whether non-
medical PO (NMPO) use among heroin users was initiated be-
fore heroin use.
Demographic Data
Demographic characteristics, measured identically across sur-
veys, included sex (male or female), age (18-29, 30-44, or ≥45
years), educational level (less than high school, high school,
or some college or more), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white
vs nonwhite [non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific
Islander, or Native American]), marital status (unmarried;
married or living as married; or widowed, separated, or di-
vorced), urbanicity (in metropolitan statistical areas or other),
region (Northeast, Midwest, South, or West, coded according
to US Census definitions based on the location of partici-
pants’residences), and federal poverty level (<100% [below
povertylevel],100%-200%,and>200%).Federalpovertylevel
was determined by family income and size and by federal pov-
erty guidelines.42
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed from February 2 to September 15, 2016.
We combined NESARC and NESARC-III data to conduct re-
peated cross-sectional analyses, as was done previously to ex-
amine other trends in these surveys.22,43,44 We added a vari-
able representing the survey from which the participant was
included.Weightedprevalenceswereproducedforfullsamples
and by subgroups.
Weconducted3setsofanalyses.First,usingseparatemod-
els for each heroin outcome (lifetime use or lifetime use dis-
order) to estimate whether prevalences differed between sur-
veys, we modeled survey year as associated with the outcome.
Second, with logistic regression models, we tested associa-
tions between demographic variables and heroin use or heroin
usedisorder.Then,totestwhetherassociationsbetweendemo-
graphiccharacteristicsandtheoutcomesdifferedbetweensur-
veys, we added an interaction term between the survey year
and each demographic variable to all models. To assess dif-
ferential associations on the prevalence scale, we first esti-
mated prevalence differences between strata of the demo-
graphic variables (eg, male and female respondents) within
each survey. We tested whether these prevalence differences
differed between surveys (eg, male and female respondents
in NESARC vs male and female respondents in NESARC-III)
using pairwise t tests for independent samples. We estimated
these prevalences and their SEs from model-predicted log-
odds, back-transformed to the prevalence scale.45
Third, we estimated the distributions of variables corre-
sponding to various aspects of severity and patterns of heroin
use among heroin users in each survey. To test whether these
distributions differed significantly between survey years, we
used Wald χ2 tests (categorical variables) or Wald F tests (con-
tinuousvariables),withP < .05indicatingsignificance.Weused
SUDAAN software (version 11.0.1)46 to incorporate the weights
and complex design features of the surveys. Unless other-
wise indicated, data are expressed as prevalence (SE).
Results
Lifetime Heroin Use, Heroin Use Disorder,
and Demographic Characteristics
The sample included 79 402 respondents (43.3% men; 56.7%
women; mean [SD] age, 46.1 [17.9] years) of the NESARC and
NESARC-III. Lifetime prevalence of heroin use increased from
2001-2002(0.33%[0.03%])to2012-2013(1.61%[0.08%])over-
all and among all subgroups: 18 to 29 years of age (0.26%
[0.07%] to 1.81% [0.21%]; P = .09), 30 to 44 years of age (0.36%
[0.06%] to 1.75% [0.17%]; P = .21), and 45 years or older (0.35%
[0.05%] to 1.46% [0.11%]). Past-year prevalence of heroin use
also increased from 2001-2002 (0.03% [0.01%) to 2012-2013
(0.21% [0.03%]; P < .001).
Lifetime prevalence of heroin use disorder increased sig-
nificantly from 2001-2002 (0.21% [0.03%]) to 2012-2013
(0.69% [0.06%]) overall and among all subgroups: 18 to 29
years of age (0.21% [0.06%] to 1.01% [0.17%]; P = .01), 30 to
44 years of age (0.20% [0.04%] to 0.77% [0.10%]; P = .03), and
45 years or older (0.22% [0.04%] to 0.51% [0.07%]). In-
creases in use and use disorder remained significant between
surveys when adjusted by lifetime NMPO. Among men, preva-
lence of heroin use (0.52% [0.05%] to 2.41% [0.15%]) and use
disorder(0.32%[0.04%]to1.04%[0.11%])increasedmorethan
among women (0.16% [0.03%] to 0.86% [0.07%] and 0.11%
[0.03%] to 0.36% [0.40%], respectively; P < .001). In 2001-
2002, white and nonwhite individuals had similar preva-
lences of heroin use (0.34% [0.04%] and 0.32% [0.05%], re-
spectively); in 2012-2013, heroin use was significantly higher
among white (1.90% [0.12%]) than nonwhite (1.05% [0.10%];
P < .001) individuals. Heroin use and use disorder increased
more among previously married (0.48% [0.08%] to 2.33%
[0.19%]; P < .001; and 0.30% [0.06%] to 0.88% [0.10%];
P = .01; respectively) and unmarried (0.51% [0.09%] to 2.29%
[0.21%]and0.38%[0.08%]to1.30%[0.17%],respectively)than
amongmarried(0.23%[0.04%]to1.10%[0.10%];P < .001;and
0.13% [0.03%] to 0.38% [0.06%]; P = .002 respectively) re-
spondents. Similar findings were observed among those with
educational levels of less than high school (0.41% [0.09%] to
2.01% [0.23%]; P = .03; and 0.24% [0.07%] to 0.87% [0.16%];
P = .08; respectively) and no more than high school (0.39%
[0.07%]to2.15%[0.19%];P = .003;and0.29%[0.06%]to1.11%
[0.14%]; P = .003; respectively) compared with those who at-
tained higher educational levels (0.28% [0.04%] to 1.30%
[0.10%] and 0.16% [0.03%] to 0.47% [0.06%], respectively).
For heroin use only, prevalence significantly increased among
respondents at less than 100% of the federal poverty level

Lifetime Heroin Use Disorders and Heroin Use Patterns
Among Lifetime Users
Lifetime prevalence of heroin use disorder among users de-
creasedsignificantlyfrom2001-2002(63.35%[4.79%])to2012-
2013 (42.69% [2.87%]; P < .001). Although the prevalence of
dependenceandmostofitscriteriawerestableacrossbothsur-
veys, DSM-IV heroin abuse was significantly less prevalent
among users in 2012-2013 (19.19% [2.34%]) than in 2001-
2002 (37.02% [4.67%]; P = .001), as were all 4 DSM-IV abuse
criteria. These included role failure (21.40% [1.86%] vs 43.03%
[4.89%]; P < .001), physically hazardous use (31.79% [2.54%]
vs 47.46% [4.60%]; P = .005), legal problems (12.99% [1.91%]
vs 23.58% [4.02%]; P = .02), and use persistence despite re-
current social problems (30.92% [2.50%] vs 52.10% [5.03%];
P < .001) (Figure 2 and Table 3).
The proportion of heroin users who reported no history
of any other drug use increased between surveys (0 in 2001-
2002 vs 2.10% [0.66%] in 2012-2013; P = .003) (Table 3). The
proportion of those who ever drove under the influence of
heroindecreasedbetweensurveys(42.07%[4.69%]vs28.90%
[2.18%]; P = .01). The proportion of individuals experiencing
remission in heroin use and use disorder was similar in the
2001-2002 and 2012-2013 surveys (use, 90.73% [3.46%] vs
86.17% [2.18%]; P = .52; disorder, 88.86% [5.20%] vs 83.02%
[3.38%]; P = .47). Frequency of NMPO use among individuals
who used heroin and POs in their lifetime did not differ be-
tween surveys. In race-stratified analyses, white individuals
were more likely to have initiated NMPO use before heroin
(35.83% [6.03%] in 2001-2002 and 52.83% [2.88] in 2012-
2013; P = .01), whereas nonwhite individuals were less likely
to have initiated NMPO use before heroin (44.12% [7.60%] in
2001-2002 and 26.20% [3.95%] in 2012-2013; P = .04). A

 greater proportion of heroin users used heroin more than 100
timesin2001-2002(51.12%[5.00%])thanin2012-2013(43.73%
[2.45%]; P < .001).
Discussion
In the 2012-2013 NESARC-III, 1.61% of US adults had ever used
heroin, and 0.69% had ever met criteria for a heroin use dis-
order. Extrapolation from these results indicates that in 2012-
2013, approximately 3 800 000 US adults used heroin at some
point in their lifetime and approximately 1 615 000 US adults
ever met criteria for lifetime heroin use disorder. Between the
2001-2002 NESARC and the 2012-2013 NESARC-III, the preva-
lence of lifetime heroin use increased almost 5-fold and the
prevalence of lifetime heroin use disorder increased approxi-
mately 3-fold. The increase in the prevalence of lifetime heroin
use disorder represented approximately 1 127 000 additional
individuals with heroin use disorder in 2012 relative to 2001.
Despite the decreased risk for heroin use disorder among us-
ers,thelargeincreaseinusersledtoanoverallincreasedpreva-
lence of heroin use disorder in the adult population.
The increases that we show in lifetime heroin use and use
disorder are consistent with increases in heroin outcomes in
several other studies during the same period. The NSDUH
showed a 62.5% increase in the rates of heroin use and a 90%
increase (from 1.0 to 1.9 per 1000 population) in the rates of
past-year heroin use disorder.17 In addition, mortality associ-
ated with heroin overdoses increased 47 by 26% from 2000 to
2013-2014.48 Data from the Treatment Episode Data Sets show
an increase in admissions due to heroin as the primary drug
from 15% in 2003 to 19% in 2013.11 Our study expands on prior
investigations by presenting change over time in the US na-
tionalprevalenceoflifetimeheroinuseandusedisordersover-
all and among users by investigating patterns of use and char-
acteristics associated with heroin use and related disorders.

 Increases in heroin use and related disorders were particu-
larly prominent among white individuals, leading to a signifi-
cantracegapinlifetimeheroinuseby2012-2013,consistentwith
other sources.17,49-51 In 2001-2002, only approximately one-
thirdofwhiteheroinusersreportedNMPOusebeforefirstusing
heroin, whereas in 2012-2013, more than half of white heroin
users reported using NMPO before heroin. In contrast, fewer
nonwhite users reported using POs before heroin in the 2012-
2013 than in 2001-2002 periods. This demographic shift is par-
allel to increases in NMPOs use since 2002, which has oc-
curred disproportionally among white individuals2,49-51 and
could be attributed to the disparities in prescribing opioids to
white patients, as shown in a meta-analysis.52 Increased avail-
ability and lower heroin prices in recent years may have con-
tributed to increased heroin use.17,49,53,54 In the past decade,
NMPO users have been at higher risk than nonusers for initia-
tion of heroin use.51,55-57 We explored the association of life-
time heaviest frequency of NMPO use with the risk for heroin
use in both surveys. Not surprisingly, the risk increased as fre-
quency of NMPO use increased. However, the increase in the
prevalence of heroin use occurred across NMPO use frequency
categories in NESARC-III compared with NESARC, suggesting
that factors other than increasingly frequent NMPO use con-
tributed to the increase in heroin use in adults in the 2012-
2013period.Differentialincreasesinlifetimeheroinuseamong
white adults persisted even after controlling for potential dif-
ferential increases in lifetime NMPO use. Heroin use appears to
havebecomemoresociallyacceptableamongsuburbanandru-
ral white individuals, perhaps because its effects seem so simi-
lartothoseofwidelyavailablePOs.13Allthesefactorscouldcon-
tribute to increased prevalence of heroin use and use disorder
among white users.

sistentwiththoseformarijuana.58,59Changesinexposuretorisk
factorsforheroinmayexplainthewideningheroinsexgap.For
example,menmayhavebeenmoreaffectedbyeconomicstress-
ors than women (eg, low manufacturing employment rates60
leading to greater increases in male heroin use).
Although heroin use is now more widespread among in-
dividuals of all socioeconomic strata (Table 1 and eTable 1 in
the Supplement) and among those with stronger bonds to so-
cial institutions,61 relative increases in heroin use and use dis-
orderacrosstimeweregreateramonglesseducatedandpoorer
individuals. These trends are concerning because increases in
the prevalence of heroin use and use disorder have been oc-
curring among vulnerable individuals who have few re-
sources to overcome problems associated with use.62,63 No
differences in prevalence of heroin use were found by age.
However, in NESARC-III, the prevalence of heroin use disor-
ders was significantly higher among younger than older aged
(≥45 years) groups.
Theproportionofheroinuserswithalifetimeheroinusedis-
order decreased between the 2 surveys, primarily owing to
decreases in DSM-IV abuse criteria. Some subgroups of heroin
users(thosewithgreaterresourcesandinfrequentusers)might
belesslikelytodevelopmilderabusesymptoms.However,ifthe
prevalence of heroin use continues to increase, the numbers of
those with heroin use disorders will likely increase as well.
No NESARC participants and 2.1% of NESARC-III partici-
pants reported that heroin was the only illicit drug they had
used. Although this result may seem surprising, it is consis-
tent with reports that some individuals transition from use of
POs to heroin with no history of other drug use besides POs.49

 these populations would likely increase the overall prevalence

NESARC. Finally, NESARC surveys only provide assessments at
2 points, and we do not have information on fluctuations and
trendsinheroinuseandrelateddisorderbetweenbothperiods.
We focused on associations with lifetime use, lifetime dis-
order, and patterns of lifetime disorder across time, which are
important population parameters, particularly for very rare
conditions such as heroin outcomes in the general popula-
tion. For very rare conditions (eg, any heroin outcome in the
general population), examining lifetime cases may be the only
way to determine demographic and clinical correlates and pat-
terns of use during the life course, which simply cannot be es-
timated from small numbers of survey participants with cur-
rent heroin use or use disorders. Furthermore, lifetime heroin
use prevalence represents the burden on a population of a
highly risky behavior for which sequelae often persist even af-
ter cessation of use of that particular drug.
Limitationsarebalancedbynumerousstrengths,including

orders may have changed over time. Continued monitoring of
such time trends is an important public health priority.
Conclusions
The prevalences of heroin use and use disorder have in-
creased significantly in the US adult general population since
the beginning of this millennium. Of note, increases have been
greatest among men, white individuals, those with low in-
come and educational levels, and, for heroin use disorder,
younger individuals. To curb the heroin epidemic, particu-
larly among younger adults, collective prevention and inter-
vention efforts may be most effective.71 Promising examples
include expansion of access to medication-assisted treat-
ment(includingmethadonehydrochloride,buprenorphinehy-
drochloride, or injectable naltrexone hydrochloride), educa-
tionalprogramsinschoolsandcommunitysettings,72overdose
prevention training in concert with comprehensive naloxone
hydrochloride distribution programs,73 and consistent use of
prescription drug monitoring programs that implement best
practices by prescribers.74,75 Efforts may be most efficient if
concentrated in states acutely affected by the opioid epi-
demic, as noted in President Obama’
s Comprehensive Addic-
tion Recovery Act signed in July 2016.71 Although many par-
