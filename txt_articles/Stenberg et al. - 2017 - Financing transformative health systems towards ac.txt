middle-income countries

Summary
Background The ambitious development agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires substantial 
investments across several sectors, including for SDG 3 (healthy lives and wellbeing). No estimates of the additional 
resources needed to strengthen comprehensive health service delivery towards the attainment of SDG 3 and universal 
health coverage in low-income and middle-income countries have been published.
Methods We developed a framework for health systems strengthening, within which population-level and 
individual-level health service coverage is gradually scaled up over time. We developed projections for 67 low-income 
and middle-income countries from 2016 to 2030, representing 95% of the total population in low-income and 
middle-income countries. We considered four service delivery platforms, and modelled two scenarios with 
differing levels of ambition: a progress scenario, in which countries’ advancement towards global targets is 
constrained by their health system’s assumed absorptive capacity, and an ambitious scenario, in which most 
countries attain the global targets. We estimated the associated costs and health effects, including reduced 
prevalence of illness, lives saved, and increases in life expectancy. We projected available funding by country and 
year, taking into account economic growth and anticipated allocation towards the health sector, to allow for an 
analysis of affordability and financial sustainability.
Findings We estimate that an additional $274 billion spending on health is needed per year by 2030 to make progress 
towards the SDG 3 targets (progress scenario), whereas US$371 billion would be needed to reach health system 
targets in the ambitious scenario—the equivalent of an additional $41 (range 15–102) or $58 (22–167) per person, 
respectively, by the final years of scale-up. In the ambitious scenario, total health-care spending would increase to a 
population-weighted mean of $271 per person (range 74–984) across country contexts, and the share of gross domestic 
product spent on health would increase to a mean of 7·5% (2·1–20·5). Around 75% of costs are for health systems, 
with health workforce and infrastructure (including medical equipment) as the main cost drivers. Despite projected 
increases in health spending, a financing gap of $20–54 billion per year is projected. Should funds be made available 
and used as planned, the ambitious scenario would save 97 million lives and significantly increase life expectancy by 
3·1–8·4 years, depending on the country profile.
Interpretation All countries will need to strengthen investments in health systems to expand service provision in 
order to reach SDG 3 health targets, but even the poorest can reach some level of universality. In view of anticipated 
resource constraints, each country will need to prioritise equitably, plan strategically, and cost realistically its own path 
towards SDG 3 and universal health coverage.

Introduction
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were 
adopted by the UN General Assembly in September, 2015. 
They set the global direction for 17 development goals, 
one of which, SDG 3, focuses on health.1 The SDGs 
substantially broaden the development agenda beyond 
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), with an 
emphasis on country-level ownership and multisectoral 
investments and a focus on leaving no one behind. After 
two decades of mostly positive economic growth, the

number of low-income countries that need external 
development assistance has been falling.2 The 2015 Addis 
Ababa Action Agenda calls for increased mobilisation of 
domestic resources to achieve the SDGs.3
SDG 3—“Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being 
for all at all ages”—is a broad health goal, and calls for 
achieving universal health coverage (UHC), which is 
defined as access for all people and communities to 
services that they need without financial hardship.1 Many 
countries are still far from UHC as measured by an index 
of access to 16 essential services.4 Furthermore, 
100 million people yearly are driven below the poverty 
line because of direct health payments.5 Moving towards 
UHC entails adopting principles of progressive 
universalism, whereby equitable access to a set of key 
health services increases with time, starting with the 
poorest. The service package provided is successively 
expanded, and an increasing share of costs is covered 
through pooled funding, thereby reducing reliance on 
out-of-pocket payments. The intersectoral links between 
the SDGs are crucial, because many goals represent 
sectors that are essential to address the environmental 
and social determinants of health.6
The additional costs for the entire SDG agenda in 
low-income and lower-middle-income countries have 
been estimated at a minimum of US$1·4 trillion (2013) 
per year.7 However, the health components of these 
estimates were derived from a pre-2015 analysis of 
various factors. Global targets and resource-needs 
estimates for post-2015 investments have been published 
for specific areas, including HIV
/AIDS,8 vaccines,9 
malaria,10 tuberculosis,11 and health workforce.12 However, 
when considering sector-wide estimates for health 
systems, WHO’s previous estimates, which were 
produced for the High Level Task Force on Innovative 
Financing for Health Systems (HLTF) in 2009,13 still 
remain widely quoted.14 In these estimates, the mean per-
person cost was estimated as an additional $29 by 2015, 
equivalent to a total of $54 (2005) when added to 
contemporary health spending ($25). The HLTF 
estimates reflected primarily an MDG agenda in low-
income countries. Other researchers have since inflated 
the estimates, to $86 in 2012 terms.15 The Lancet 
Commission on Investing in Health drew upon the 2009 
HLTF estimates, and estimated that the cost of 
convergence for low-income countries—with a focus on 
maternal and child health and communicable diseases—
would be $30 billion per year by 2035.16,17
We revisit these estimates and provide a new round of 
WHO estimations of the resource needs for strengthening 
transformative health systems to reach UHC in the 
post-2015 era of SDGs.
Methods
Definition of the scope
Our analysis considers specific SDG targets as integrated 
parts of the broader attainment of UHC. In addition to 
SDG 3, we considered other targets for which health is a 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
In 2009, WHO published estimates of resources needed by 2015 
to strengthen health service delivery in low-income countries to 
achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). These 
estimates were presented through the High-level Taskforce on 
Innovative International Financing for Health Systems (HLTF). 
At the time, the average per-person need was estimated as an 
additional US$29 (US$ 2005) by 2015, equivalent to a total 
mean spending need of $54 across low-income countries, 
reflecting MDG-related service benchmarks for 49 countries. 
Others subsequently converted the $54 estimate to 
$86 (US$ 2012). Since the adoption of the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) in September, 2015, demand is 
growing for guidance on pathways and resources needed to 
achieve the health-related SDG targets. Previous attempts to 
project resource implications for countries adopting SDG 3 
targets have drawn upon the HLTF 2009 estimates, because no 
updates have been published.
Added value of this study
In recognition of the need to update the previous estimates 
and provide a more comprehensive assessment, we modelled 
country-based projections of strengthening health systems 
efforts to achieve the dual goals of population health and 
financial protection. We drew upon available studies and 
sectoral price tags, best practice, and tools to run models for 
67 low-income and middle-income countries to assess yearly 
resource needs from 2016 to 2030. We present projected costs 
and health effects, along with the estimated financing gap. 
To our knowledge, ours is the first study to present a 
combined analysis of system-wide strategies to address a wide 
range of SDG health indicators and the associated overall 
health effects as shown by projected gains in life expectancy 
and healthy years lived.
Implications of all the available evidence
We have developed models and tools that allow detailed 
analysis of resource needs to strengthen country health 
systems and expand service packages, and projection of the 
associated expected health benefits. Our results provide 
evidence about the probable cost drivers within countries 
seeking to expand their health service coverage and an 
indicative estimate of the additional resource need. 
These estimates can be used to inform global policy discussions 
around post-2015 investment strategies and the relative role 
of domestic versus external funding. Application of these 
methods and tools at the country level can guide national 
priority setting and resource allocation.

All goals were fully or partly included in our analysis except for goal 3.6. Outputs were not modelled for several outcome indicators because of a lack of data (3.7.2) or a lack of 
projection model (3.4.2). Some of the targets are addressed within the analysis (eg, harmful use of alcohol [3.5], for which we estimate costs related to prevention and 
counselling); however, we do not project and report outcomes for the exact SDG indicator (3.5.2, which relates to the consumption as measured in litres of alcohol per capita).

expenditure projections is based on normative increases in public expenditure that would be favourable for increasing financial protection and reducing reliance on out-of-pocket 
payments. However, in our projections we do not specifically look at household health expenditure, nor do we specifically model the share of official development assistance 
allocated to health. §Estimates take into account international health regulations indicators as the basis for assessments of what investments are required, but the model does not 
project the extent to which capacity would increase. ¶Analysis only includes underweight (wasting and stunting). ||Costs mainly fall in sectors outside the health sector.

(health workforce, infrastructure, and supply chain) was 
interlinked and closely related to the scope of services 
provided. Other health system investments (eg, health 
information systems, emergency risk management, 
governance and health financing) are more independent 
of the service package and relate to strengthening 
institutions. We considered resources needed for 
strengthening 
health 
system 
performance 
(eg, 
governance-related functions such as audits, licensing, 
and inspection of health providers, contracting out 
health services), and costs for provision of 187 specific 
interventions, such as iron and folic acid for pregnant 
people, and outreach services to high-risk populations 
for HIV/AIDS (tables 1, 2; appendix).
In recognition of links to other sectors, we estimated 
costs (and, when possible, the associated effect) of 
increasing access to water, sanitation, hygiene, clean 
fuels for cooking, and cash-transfer programmes that 
benefit poor households—interventions that have direct 
effects on health but the costs of which would not be 
borne mainly by the health sector. For these cross-sectoral 
investments, we estimated the share of costs that would 
be attributed to, and financed by, the health sector as 
opposed to other sectors. In this Article, we focus on 
health sector costs, with costs for other sectors described 
in detail in the accompanying technical report.18
Although the SDGs concern all countries, we limited 
our analysis to low-income and middle-income countries, 
because these countries are faced with the greatest 
challenges in terms of increasing service provision and 
resource mobilisation (appendix). Our model included 
all low-income countries, the 20 most populous 
lower-middle-income countries, and the 20 most 
populous 
upper-middle-income 
countries 
(thereby 
including large countries such as China, India, and 
Indonesia). We excluded four countries for which gross 
domestic product (GDP) data were lacking, so our final 
sample was 67 countries. These countries represent 95% 
of the total population in low-income and middle-income 
countries, and include a set of the most vulnerable 
conflict-affected and fragile nations (appendix).
Pathways to UHC
Progressive universalism17 and the building of sustainable, 
resilient health systems capable of ensuring equitable 
access though a people-centred service delivery approach 
are at the centre of our model. We considered four service 
delivery platforms, representing different modes for 
providing 
patients 
with 
information, 
counselling, 
essential preventive commodities, screening, diagnosis, 
treatment, 
and 
follow-up—a 
continuum 
of 
care 
(appendix).
In view of the global nature of our analysis, we set 
targets consistent with SDG 2030 global targets on the 
basis of global best practices, including globally accepted 
health system benchmarks and WHO intervention 
guidelines and recommended practices.8–12,19 We modelled 
a progressive expansion of service coverage as health 
systems developed. We recognised that some types of 
services face fewer implementation challenges and 
therefore can be scaled up faster than other more 
complex services. For example, services delivered 
through the policy and population-wide or periodic 
schedulable and outreach platforms (eg, bednets) require 
less well developed infrastructure and referral chains 
than do specialised care services (eg, cancer treatment). 
When setting targets, we took into account the probable 
attainable frontiers for different types of service delivery 
platforms (figure 1). For example, management of non-
communicable diseases is modelled to reach a maximum 
of 60% coverage, a level that many high-income countries 
have not reached. Other services, such as maternal, child,

and immunisation services, were projected to potentially 
reach 95% coverage.
Acknowledging the diversity in low-income and 
middle-income countries, we grouped countries into 
five types—conflict-affected countries, countries with 
vulnerable systems, and countries in health systems 
categories 1, 2, and 3 (appendix)—to determine the 
timing and duration of strategic investments. Conflict-
affected countries are those with an internal or external 
conflict which considerably limits the state’s ability to 
provide health services. Vulnerable countries were those 
with structural vulnerabilities—such as localised 
conflicts, a weak state apparatus, external international 
humanitarian response structures, or health crises 
(eg, Ebola)—that score high on fragility. Health systems 
categories refer to health system strength, with proxies 
for scale-up capacity based on existing resources and 
current service delivery performance (appendix). Each 
country was expected to make progress towards UHC, 
but is by necessity constrained by the level of 
development of the existing health system, especially 
human 
resources 
and 
functional 
infrastructure. 
Conflict-affected and emergency-affected states in 
particular require stability before capital investments 
can be made to strengthen the foundations of health 
systems. More stable systems (eg, countries in health 
systems categories 2 and 3) could scale up more rapidly 
within our model.
Because of uncertainty about the capacity of health 
systems to absorb additional resources in a timely 
manner,20 we modelled two scenarios with differing 
levels of ambition: a progress scenario, in which 
countries’ advancement towards global targets was 
constrained by their health systems’ assumed absorptive 
capacity, and an ambitious scenario, in which most 
countries attained global targets (appendix). Scale-up 
trajectories in the two scenarios were driven by 
characteristics of different interventions and delivery 
platforms. We modelled that policy and population-
wide interventions and periodic schedulable and 
outreach services would be rapidly scaled up for all 
countries in both scenarios, whereas facility-based 
services would follow the pathways of health-system 
strengthening, where the two scenarios increasingly 
diverge (appendix). Throughout the modelling, we 
incorporated costs for reducing inequities, including 
reorientation of health systems to practices that favour 
inclusiveness and explicit adjustments for special 
populations (appendix).
Projection of costs, effects, and financing
In this analysis, we use more robust and comprehensive 
methods and tools than were used in the previous 2009 
HLTF estimates. For direct intervention-related costs 
and effects, we used Spectrum-based OneHealth tool, 
which takes an integrated approach to the assessment of 
costs and health benefits, and incorporates interlinked 
epidemiological reference models. Targets were aligned 
with published disease-specific costs in terms of priority 
health interventions and 2030 targets,8–12,19,21 and 
combined within a system-wide perspective. We 
computed the estimated need for health services 
dynamically over time, taking into account population 
growth, reduced mortality, and reduced incidence or 
prevalence of disorders as coverage of interventions 
(preventive and curative) increased. Analysis with the 
OneHealth tool was complemented by Excel-based 
models, when needed, and system-specific components 
were excluded from disease-specific costs to avoid 
double counting.18 We used a bottom-up, inputs-based 
costing approach (quantities times price), taking into 
account a steady closing of the gap between current and 
target investments year by year. Inputs were multiplied 
by country-specific prices from the WHO-CHOICE 
database and other publicly available sources. We report 
costs in non-inflation adjusted 2014 US$.
Projected health outcomes are reported in line with the 
SDG indicator framework and include improved 
nutrition, reduced disease prevalence and age-specific 
mortality rates. On the basis of OneHealth tool 
projections and Spectrum outputs, we estimated the rise 
in life expectancy as a result of increased intervention 
coverage, and compared this increase to 2015 life 
expectancy. Tuberculosis11,22 and neglected tropical 
disease23 outcomes were adapted from earlier studies. We 
ran 
life-expectancy 
projections 
for 
18 
countries 
representing 60% of the global burden of disease (2010) 
and 79% of the population of the 67-country set. We also 
modelled a second summary effect measure: the 
projected increase in healthy years lived across all 
67 countries.
On the basis of International Monetary Fund data 
(from October, 2016), we developed two main financial 
space 
scenarios 
by 
country, 
incorporating 
GDP 
projections and assumptions on available government 
revenues and government health priorities (appendix). 
Projections detail the financial space for total health 
expenditure to assess the potential envelope of available 
resources, and focus on fiscal space and general 
government health expenditure, which have central roles 
in advancing UHC through prepayment, cross-subsidies, 
pooling, and strategic purchasing.3 To assess affordability 
and the financing gap, we calculated the incremental cost 
by year, and compared this cost with the projected 
available financing by country and year.
Because investments in infrastructure peak in 2029 
(such that access to services is maximised in 2030), we 
report additional costs in billions as the mean annual 
need during a mature (ie, end-term) scale-up phase 
(2026–30). Additional costs per-person are reported for 
2030. To provide an estimate similar to the previously 
published estimate of $86,15 we also calculated a 
measure for total cost per person, which we defined as 
total current health expenditure (reported in 2014 in

Data are in US$ (2014). Income groups were defined as of July, 2016. Per person costs are reported as population-weighted mean values per group for the year 2030. If the mean annual investment need per person during the full 5 years of the end-term 
scale-up phase 2026–30 were considered instead, values in the ambitious scenario per person would be $59 overall, $95 in conflict-affected countries, $99 in countries with vulnerable systems, $73 in health system category 1 countries, $59 in health 
system category 2 countries, $50 in health system category 3 countries, $82 in low-income countries, $59 in lower-middle-income countries, and $51 in upper-middle-income countries—some per-person costs would thus be higher than the 2030 value, 
particularly in low-income and vulnerable countries. Because of rounding, numbers might not add up. THE=total health expenditure. GGHE=general government health expenditure. *Computed as current THE in 2014 plus modelled additional cost in

Consultation and review
A consultation and review process shaped this analysis. 
We took into account the breadth of previous work and 
suggestions on what should be included in the scope of 
the exercise. A WHO and UNAIDS expert group met 
monthly to provide inputs on the framework and 
modelling approach from the perspective of individual 
disease areas and health system building blocks. In 
July 2016, WHO organised an expert review and country 
feedback meeting to discuss the methodology and 
preliminary results of the analysis. Participants included 
international experts and academics, and representatives 
from 14 low-income and middle-income countries, who 
jointly accounted for more than 75% of the population 
covered in the analysis. Country participants reviewed 
country-specific input assumptions, and their feedback 
was incorporated into the models.
Role of the funding source
The study funders had roles in study design; data 
collection, analysis, and interpretation; and writing of the 
Article. The corresponding author had full access to all 
the data in the study and had final responsibility for the 
decision to submit for publication.
Results
The progress scenario costs increased over time, from an 
initial $104 billion annually to $274 billion per year in 
2026–30, the final years of scale-up, or $41 per person 
(range $15–102) by 2030. The ambitious scenario would 
require annual additional investments of $134 billion per 
year initially, reaching $371 billion in 2026–30; the 
equivalent mean per-person estimate for 2030 was $58, 
which varied widely by country (range 22–167).
Adding incremental costs of the ambitious scenario to 
current spending would produce an estimated mean total 
cost per person in 2030 of $271 for all 67 countries (table 3). 
In the ambitious scenario, additional costs represent a 
mean of 4·6% of projected GDP in 2030 (range 0·2–17·9), 
and adding these costs to current health spending is 
projected to increase health spending as a share of GDP 
from a mean of 5·6% (2·2–10·8) to a mean of 7·5% 
(2·1–20·5) for the entire sample (appendix). In the model, 
conflict-affected countries, countries with vulnerable 
systems, and countries in health system category 1 had the 
greatest increases in health spending as a proportion of 
GDP over time (appendix), because these countries have 
the largest current gaps and slowest forecasted GDP 
growth.
The annual funding gap in 2026–30 when the 
two resource-needs scenarios were paired with an 
optimistic and a more moderate financing scenario, was 
estimated at $20–54 billion for all 67 countries (table 4). 
23–32 countries are projected to face a funding gap, 
20–27 of which are low-income countries (table 4). 
Countries affected by conflict, with vulnerable systems, 
or in health system category 1 can mobilise only some 
domestic resources in both the optimistic and moderate 
financing scenarios (appendix). Countries in health 
system categories 2 and 3, where most of the sample’s 
population resides, account for a high share (80%) of 
additional costs (table 3), but were projected to have the 
greatest ability to move towards UHC through domestic 
financing (appendix).
Around 75% of the additional cost is for health systems; 
health workforce and health facilities (including 
equipment and operating costs) are the main cost drivers 
(figure 2A). The ambitious scenario projections add more 
than 23·6 million health workers, 3·0 million of whom 
would be medical doctors, and includes the construction 
of over 415 000 health facilities, 378 000 of which would be 
primary health centres (appendix). Most resources will be 
needed to support first-level (ie, primary) clinical services 
(figure 2B). Such investments would bring health 
workforce population densities for nurses and midwifes 
above current densities in upper-middle income countries 
(table 5). Among programme-specific costs, non-
communicable diseases account for 44% of costs 
(appendix).
If additional funds were used as described, 97 million 
lives could be saved and life expectancy could increase by 
as much as 8·4 years (tables 6, 7; appendix). The

This table includes only countries for which projected costs exceed the projected available financing in one or more 
years during the end-term scale-up period—ie, there is a financing gap during at least one of the years 2026–30 within 
the modelled projections. Population and cost data refer to the year or years in which a financing gap has been 
projected. If the gap lasts for more than 1 year, the results represent the mean gap and population size during those 
years. n=the number of countries within each group that is projected to have a financing gap during at least 1 year.

67 countries would see a total gain of 535 million healthy 
life-years during the SDG period, with 81 million healthy 
life-years gained in 2030 (figure 3).
Discussion
According to our model, an additional $371 billion will 
be needed per year for low-income and middle-income 
countries to reach the health-related SDG targets. Our 
estimate is higher than those from previous modelling 
studies. The UN Sustainable Development Solutions 
Network estimated a yearly additional resource need for 
all the SDGs of $1·4 trillion, with required resources 
for health estimated to be $69–89 billion.7 Our estimates 
are also higher than the commonly cited benchmark of 
$86 per person, derived from the HLTF analysis for the 
MDGs.15
Our ambitious scenario estimates of projected country 
total costs ranged from $74–984 (mean $271) per person 
per year. However, our estimates differ from previous 
ones in terms of the number and type of countries 
included (our analysis included more middle-income 
countries than did previous analyses), which makes 
direct comparison complicated. A more relevant 
comparison with the HLTF estimates would be to 
consider low-income countries only, for which we 
estimated an additional $76 per person for ambitious 
targets, or a projected total cost of $112 (table 3). 
Differences between this set and previous estimates are 
driven by new and more ambitious health system 
benchmarks (eg, health workforce density), the scope of 
the costing (with our inclusion of emergency risk 
management, non-communicable diseases, etc), the level 
of ambition for disease-specific targets (eg, for 
HIV/AIDS),8 and higher current (ie, baseline) health 
spending. Our presentation of mean, minimum, and 
maximum estimates by country group underline the 
varied investment needs and should be understood as a 
caveat against adopting a single number. 
About three-quarters of additional investments need to 
go towards health-systems strengthening. This finding is 
consistent with those of the HLTF (2009) and confirms 
the findings of the four main Commissions (by WHO, 
Harvard University and the London School of Hygiene & 
Tropical Medicine, the US National Academy of 
Medicine, and the UN) in the wake of Ebola, that health 
systems were underfunded in the MDG era.24,25 
Substantial investments are needed to put infrastructure, 
health workforce, and equipment in place and to provide 
essential health services—all of which are required to 
attain the SDG targets. A key public health concern today 
is the shortfall of health workers in a context of 
global shortage of health skills.26 Health workers and 
infrastructure are a public necessity, not luxuries: even if 
countries implement our proposed model, they would 
still fall short of current system capacity in countries in 
the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and 
Development (table 5).
Middle-income countries are well equipped to 
self-finance the investment—the financing gap is mostly 
in low-income countries. Some middle-income countries 
might even set more ambitious targets than we did in 
this analysis, targets that address broader health issues, 
including ageing and further boosting the quality of 
care, which require more resources. Of the total annual 
financing gap of $20–54 billion per year, $17–35 billion 
per year falls on low-income countries, with conflict-
affected countries burdened with a gap of $3–4 billion 
(table 4). Many countries will thus continue to need 
external financial support throughout the period of the 
SDGs, mostly to build the foundations of their health 
systems.3,7

Additional health programme costs include those that are programme specific but do not refer to specific drugs, 
supplies, or laboratory tests. Examples include costs for programme-specific administration staff, supervision, and 
monitoring relative to the services for which the programme provides leadership and oversight (eg, the national 
malaria programme provides implementation guidance, and monitors and supervises service delivery for 
malaria). Other examples include mass media campaigns and demand generation. These data are presented as a 
table in the appendix.

However, even the poorest countries can reach some 
level of universality. In settings where clinical services 
are still underdeveloped and human resources for health 
are critically low, there is potential to rapidly move 
towards full coverage with interventions that can be 
delivered through non-clinical service delivery platforms. 
All countries could afford universal access to the range of 
public health services delivered through mostly policy, 
population-wide, and periodic schedulable and outreach 
delivery platforms (appendix). Examples include effective 
policy interventions to curb the rise in non-communicable 
diseases, which could substantially reduce future 
expenses on disease management27—eg, fiscal policies, 
such as public health taxes on goods harmful to health, 
including tobacco, alcohol, and sugar.28
Investments on the scale modelled would bring 
countries closer to UHC standards and could save 
97 million lives. The modelled increase in life expectancy 
and gains in healthy life-years—overall measures of 
UHC impact that should be considered in addition to 
disease-specific SDG indicator reporting—is substantial. 
Estimates of healthy life-years gained are crucial for 
diseases for which treatment focuses on quality of life 
rather than cure. For example, mental, neurological and 
substance use disorders contribute only 3% of projected 
life expectancy gain, but 15% of the projected healthy life-
years gained.  We also expect a reduction in out-of-pocket 
payments with time as universal, obligatory pre-paid 
financing for UHC expands.29
Improvement of the efficiency of current systems will 
be crucial to reach SDG targets. In our modelled scale-up, 
we assume efficient practices. However, evidence shows 
that resources are not always used to their best 
potential.29–31 Although expectations of zero wastage 
might be unrealistic, we considered scenarios that would 
improve system efficiencies (eg, shifting to generic 
drugs, reducing fraud and corruption), thereby effectively 
freeing up resources and decreasing overall projected 
costs. A converse argument would be that weak capacity 
in low-income countries increases the costs of making 
improvements, and that current inefficiencies could be 
assumed to also be prevalent in future systems, implying 
that costs should be higher than those presented here. In

Results are modelled for 18 countries and include the projected effect of scaling up HIV/AIDS, maternal and child 
health (including stillbirth prevention), and a set of non-communicable diseases (eg, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, 
asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, epilepsy, mental disorders, neurological disorders, and substance use 
disorders). Results are shown as population-weighted estimates per country category. *Estimated increase in life 
expectancy as a result of the interventions considered within the analysis, based on comparisons between 2015 life 
expectancy and the scenario with ambitious coverage increase. †Modelled difference in life expectancy between 
projecting the 2015 coverage level through to 2030 with existing population profile and life expectancy in the 
modelled ambitious scale-up scenario. This estimate provides a more conservative increase in life expectancy 
attributed to the modelled interventions directly, and excludes projected health improvements as captured within the 
UN population projections. The reporting of life expectancy is valid given that, within our model, we project an 
expansion of health systems that will serve conditions beyond those explicitly identified within our intervention list. 
With the exception of the countries with the strongest health systems at baseline, the interventions being scaled up 
would, in most cases, more than double the projected life expectancy gains.

the appendix we present cost estimates in high-efficiency 
and low-efficiency scenarios.
Investment in health should accelerate progress in 
other SDG areas, and vice versa. Our results are 
consistent with previous findings that investment in the 
health sector alone is not sufficient to attain global health 
targets (table 6). For example, under 5 mortality is 
modelled to reach 29 per 1000 livebirths  on average, but 
the global target is 25. Important additional factors 
include 
multisector 
engagement, 
emphasis 
on 
accountability, and alignment of stakeholder action.32 
Strengthening of the health workforce should result in 
direct and indirect contributions to economic growth, as 
noted by the High Level Commission on Health 
Employment and Economic Growth.24 Several studies17,33 
have shown substantial economic gains as a result of 
investments in health.
Although global estimates are useful advocacy tools to 
highlight investment needs, our cost estimates are not 
to be interpreted as universal spending targets that 
would apply for every country. Contexts are diverse, and 
spending a specific amount per person will not 
necessarily produce a specific outcome, nor would 
spending a specific amount per person result in the 
same outcome in two different countries. To advocate 
for SDG investments, progress needs to be monitored

and global estimates need to be regularly updated 
accordingly, taking into account new evidence, improved 
projection models, and the emergence of new 
technologies.
We acknowledge the limitations of our work, many of 
which concern uncertainties related to projections. GDP 
forecasts are uncertain and are a major determinant of 
our financing projections and subsequent analyses of 
affordability. Uncertainties increase as the projections 
stretch into the future. Another limitation is the 
exclusion of some SDG conditions or targets, such as 
road traffic accidents, hepatitis treatment, and chemical 
poisoning, because costing frameworks and impact 
models were not available. We were unable to include 
interventions for which current levels of coverage or 
benchmarks could not be identified (eg, oral health, 
assistive technologies). Our estimates should therefore 
be considered as minimum indicative estimates.
Our estimates should be considered a starting point for 
discussions. Not every country can provide the full range 
of services recommended to attain the SDGs at the same 
speed, but every country can make substantial progress 
during the next 15 years. With 17 development goals, 
health and development advocates in each country will 
need to make the case as to why health care should be 
prioritised 
financially. 
Strong 
public 
financial 
management and good implementation capacity will be 
required to use resources effectively in making progress 
towards the SDGs. The investment case for health is 
strong and can be easily made. Each country should use 
available evidence and tools to prioritise equitably, plan 
strategically, and cost realistically its own path towards 
SDG 3 and UHC.
