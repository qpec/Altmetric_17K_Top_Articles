ABSTRACT
According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics’ influential position statement on vegetarian-
ism, meat and seafood can be replaced with milk, soy=legumes, and eggs without any negative
effects in children. The United States Department of Agriculture endorses a similar view. The pre-
sent paper argues that the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics ignores or gives short shrift to dir-
ect and indirect evidence that vegetarianism may be associated with serious risks for brain and
body development in fetuses and children. Regular supplementation with iron, zinc, and B12 will
not mitigate all of these risks. Consequently, we cannot say decisively that vegetarianism or
veganism is safe for children.

Introduction
Vegetarian (or lacto-ovo-vegetarian) diets do not include
meat, fowl, or seafood. Vegan diets do not include any
animal source foods. According to the Academy of Nutrition
and Dietetics’ (AND) position statement on vegetarianism:
“appropriately planned vegetarian, including vegan, diets are-
… appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including preg-
nancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, [and] adolescence,” and
“may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment
of certain diseases” (Melina, Craig, and Levin 2016). The
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) treats vege-
tarianism and veganism as healthy alternatives. Both the
AND and the USDA recommend that vegetarians replace
meat and seafood primarily with soy (and other legumes),
dairy, and eggs. According to the USDA, vegans can substi-
tute fortified soy products for dairy and eggs.
Is there sufficient evidence to say definitively that an
“appropriately planned” vegetarian or vegan diet adhering to
the USDA’s recommendations is healthy for “all stages of
the life cycle”? There have been a number of long-term epi-
demiological studies of adult vegetarians=vegans, the results
of which suggest that, although vegetarians have a lower
incidence of certain diseases, all-cause mortality in compar-
able populations of vegetarians and omnivores is similar
(Appleby et al. 2016; Key, Appleby, and Rosell 2006;
Mihrshahia et al. 2017). There is much less evidence avail-
able concerning the health effects of meatless diets in chil-
dren. The present paper focuses on the health consequences
of vegetarianism and veganism for children from conception
to the end of the growing period. It does not argue that
vegetarianism or veganism is unhealthy for children, but
considers whether there is enough evidence to justify the
AND’s unqualified statement, which suggests that there is
definitive evidence that vegetarian and vegan diets can be as
healthy for children as diets that include meat and seafood.
It will be argued that the AND ignores or gives short shrift
to evidence that vegetarianism may be harmful during preg-
nancy, that milk, soy=legumes, and eggs are not equal sub-
stitutes for meat, and that realistic vegetarian diets put
children at risk for deficiencies that may have both short-
term and permanent negative health consequences.
Vegetarianism during pregnancy
Regarding the effect of vegetarianism during pregnancy, the
AND says that “Limited research indicates that where food
access is adequate, vegetarian pregnancy outcomes, such as
birth weight and pregnancy duration, are similar to those in
nonvegetarian pregnancy” (Melina, Craig, and Levin 2016).
This is an incomplete summary of the evidence.
In most populations, the male=female sex ratio of new-
borns is around 105:100. Environmental stress is associated
with a lower sex ratio due to the selective spontaneous abor-
tion of male fetuses (Bruckner et al. 2014; Fukuda et al. 1998;
Kanninen and Karhula 2016). Malnutrition specifically has
been linked to a lower sex ratio (Andersson and Bergstr€
om
1998; Williams and Gloster 1992). One possible test of
whether vegetarianism is healthy during pregnancy is to deter-
mine whether it has an effect on the sex ratio of newborns. If
it is healthy, it should have no effect on or should raise the
sex ratio; if unhealthy, then vegetarianism should lower it.
Hudson and Buckley (2000) found that among a sample
of almost 6,000 pregnant women at a British hospital, about
5% of whom were vegetarian (and almost all of whom were
white), the sex ratio was considerably lower among children
born to vegetarians compared with those born to omnivores:

 81.5:100 vs. 106:100. That is, vegetarians were 23% less likely
to give birth to a boy. Given the known association between
environmental stress, including malnutrition, and a lower
chance of giving birth to a boy, a possible explanation for
these findings is that vegetarianism increases the chance of
spontaneous abortion, particularly for male fetuses. The
AND does not mention Hudson and Buckley’s study, or the
effect of vegetarianism=veganism on the sex ratio=spontane-
ous abortion, in its position statement on vegetarianism
(Melina, Craig, and Levin 2016).
As discussed below, vegetarians=vegans are at risk for a
number of nutritional deficiencies that could potentially
harm the fetus.
Are milk, soy, and eggs equally beneficial
substitutes for meat?
The AND, the USDA, and other health authorities claim
that dairy and legumes (especially soy) and, to a lesser
extent, eggs can be substituted for meat with no ill effects.
This section examines evidence that raises doubts about
this position.
Milk
Physical and cognitive development
There has been only one controlled study on the effects of
milk versus meat consumption in children. Subjects in the
study were 6–14-year-olds (median 7.4 years) in Embu,
Kenya. Due to poverty, the children were largely vegetarian,
with more than 75% of their energy intake coming from
maize and beans, less than 6% from animal source foods.
Their daily intake of milk and meat was very low at
approximately 35 g and 11 g, respectively. Researchers div-
ided a large group of children into four conditions: Meat,
Milk, Energy, and Control. Every school day, children in the
Meat, Milk, and Energy groups received a local plant-based
dish supplemented with 60 g of ground beef, 200 mL of
milk, or an extra 3 g of oil, respectively. The meals in each
of these three groups had approximately the same number
of calories. Children in the Control group did not receive
any extra meals. The researchers measured several outcomes
related to growth, intellectual ability, school performance,
and social behavior (Neumann et al. 2003).
After 2.25 years, the Meat group had the best health out-
comes. The Meat group showed the greatest improvement
on Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM—a measure of fluid
intelligence),
while
the
Milk
group
showed
the
least
improvement, significantly below the other three groups
(including the Control). While all groups started off with
roughly the same RPM scores, Meat ended up approximately
0.65 standard deviations higher than Milk (Hulett et al.
2014), corresponding to a difference of around 10 IQ points.
The Meat and Energy groups showed significantly more
improvement on arithmetic tests than the Milk and Control.
The Meat group showed a significantly larger percentage
increase in end-of-term test scores compared to the others,
with the greatest increase being in the arithmetic subtest.
Over the course of the study, the Meat group had the high-
est levels of physical activity during free play, the greatest
increase in leadership activities, and the greatest increase in
initiative behavior. The Milk group had the lowest level of
physical activity and leadership and initiative behavior
among the three intervention groups. Regarding growth:
Only children in the Milk group who were below age 6 or
had stunted growth experienced a greater rate of height
increase.
All
three
intervention
groups
experienced
an
improvement
in
weight
gain
relative
to
the
Control.
Children in the Meat group gained approximately 50% more
mid-upper-arm muscle area than those in the Milk group,
and 100% more than those in the Energy and Control.
Neumann et al. (2007) suggest that the “improved cogni-
tive performance, increased [physical activity] and leadership
and initiative behaviors in the Meat group” may be due to
their consumption of vitamin B12 and more bioavailable
iron and zinc, since meat improves the absorption of iron
and
zinc
from
“fiber
and
phytate-rich
plant
staples.”
Micronutrients and high-quality protein in meat may be
important for cognitive performance. As to why the Milk
group obtained the lowest scores on RPM, Neumann et al.
suggest that this may be due to the high casein and calcium
content of milk that interferes with iron absorption, which
is essential for optimum cognitive performance. They attri-
bute the increase in mid-upper-arm muscle area in the Meat
group to the “intake of zinc and complete protein, which
both promote protein synthesis … , and iron and protein,
which
are
essential
to
myogloboin
synthesis
in
stri-
ated muscle … .”
This study of Kenyan children does not decisively refute
the
AND’s
claim
that
“appropriated
planned”
vegeta-
rian=vegan diets can be as healthy as diets that include
meat. For one thing, none of the children were on diets
meeting the USDA’s recommendations. Also, it is unfortu-
nate that the study compared meat and milk supplementa-
tion with oil supplementation rather than soy. The study
does not say whether a soy product such as tofu could pro-
duce outcomes equal to meat. However, the AND and the
USDA say that dairy can be used as an equal substitute for
meat. The Kenyan study casts serious doubt on that claim.
Children in the Milk group had significantly worse out-
comes than those in the Meat group in terms of RPM
scores, academic performance, muscle growth, and physical
and social activity. Despite the limitations of the study, it is
still the only controlled experiment comparing the benefits
of milk versus meat in children, and it suggests that milk is
not an equal substitute for meat. The AND does not men-
tion this study in its position statement on vegetarianism
(Melina, Craig, and Levin 2016).
Acne vulgaris
Contrary to some oft-repeated claims that diet is unrelated
to acne, there is overwhelming evidence that diet is a major
factor in acne. Acne appears to be absent in populations
that have not adopted a Western diet. For example, Kitavans
of the Trobriand Island live by horticulture and fishing.
They

no
dairy
or

and
a
2

 “negligible” amount of cereals, sugar, and salt. Lindeberg
examined 1,200 Kitavans for the presence of acne. All 1,200
were at least 10 years old and 300 were between 15 and
25 years old. Lindeberg did not find one single papule, pus-
tule, or open comedone in any of the 1,200 Kitavans
(Cordain et al. 2002). The Ach�
e of Paraguay engage in a
combination
of
hunting
and
gathering
and
farming.
Western foods such as wheat and sugar comprise only
around 8% of the diet. Hurtado examined 115 Ach�
e includ-
ing 15 who were between the ages of 15 and 25. After
Hurtado’s examinations, family practitioner physicians con-
ducted the same examination every six months for two
years. “Not a single papule, pustule, or open comedo was
observed in the entire population” (Cordain et al. 2002).
The nonexistence of acne among Kitavans and Ach�
e cannot
be explained entirely by genetics. More Westernized South
American Indians and Pacific Islanders show high rates of
acne (though not quite as high as the white population)
(Fleischer, Feldman, and Bradham 1994; Freyre et al. 1998).
Cordain et al. (2002) hypothesize that acne in Western
populations is caused by diet-induced hyperinsulinemia, and
this could explain the relationship between milk and acne:
Despite its low glycemic load, dairy triggers a large insulin
response (Holt, Brand Miller, and Petocz 1997; Hoyt,
Hickey, and Cordain 2005; €
Ostman, Liljeberg Elmståhl, and
Bj€
orck 2001). Observational studies have found a significant
association between dairy intake and acne in adolescents
(Adebamowo et al. 2006, 2008; Adebamowo et al. 2005;
Ismail, Manaf, and Azizan 2012). Controlled experiments
have found that a high protein, low-insulin-response-trigger-
ing diet significantly improves symptoms in acne patients
(Kwon et al. 2012; Smith et al. 2007). While there is still a
debate about exactly why dairy consumption is associated
with
acne,
the
association
appears
to
be
causal
and
significant.
Acne is a negative health outcome that is expensive to
treat and which has a strong association with depression
and suicide in adolescents (Purvis et al. 2006). There is rea-
son to believe that substituting dairy for meat increases the
risk
of
developing
acne
during
childhood=adolescence
(assuming it would involve consuming more dairy on aver-
age than omnivores). This is a negative health outcome not
discussed in the AND’s position statement on vegetarianism.
Soy and other legumes
Phytoestrogens
Phytoestrogens, particularly isoflavones, are found in high
concentrations
in
legumes
and
especially
in
soy.
Vegetarians=vegans tend to have very high blood levels of
phytoestrogens compared with omnivores. While phytoes-
trogens have been associated with some health benefits in
adults, there are serious concerns about their potential nega-
tive health effects on infants and children (Patisaul and
Jefferson 2010).
Animal studies show that interfering with estrogen during
critical periods in development “leads to a myriad of adverse
health outcomes including malformations in the ovary,
uterus, mammary gland and prostate, early puberty, reduced
fertility, [and] disrupted brain organization” (Patisaul and
Jefferson 2010). Patisaul and Jefferson note that these conse-
quences correspond to some public health trends that
emerged in Western countries, which have occurred in tan-
dem with greater consumption of soy. North and Golding
(2000) found that males born to vegetarian mothers in
England were more than 3.5 times as likely to have hypospa-
dias (i.e., malformed genitalia), which was statistically linked
to the consumption of high-phytoestrogen legumes (hypo-
spadias rates were 2.2% and 0.6% for boys born to vegetar-
ian and omnivorous mothers, respectively).
Rodent studies have found that phytoestrogens such as
genistein (which is abundant in soy) interfere with the
development of brain regions that are sensitive to estrogen
levels in both male and female rodents—regions that are
sexually dimorphic (Bateman and Patisaul 2008; Kouki et al.
2003; Lund et al. 2001; Scallet et al. 2004). Whether or to
what extent these findings generalize to humans is uncertain
(Patisaul and Jefferson 2010).
Jefferson, Padilla-Banks, and Newbold (2005) found that
administering
genistein
to
neonatal
female
mice
at
“environmentally relevant doses”—i.e., doses comparable to
what human neonates can be exposed to—led in later life to
“abnormal estrous cycles, altered ovarian function, early
reproductive senescence, and subfertility=infertility.” Nagao
et al. (2001) obtained similar results. It is not clear whether
these findings apply to humans.
Antinutrients: Iron and zinc absorption
Legumes, particularly soy, are high in phytate, which signifi-
cantly inhibits the absorption of minerals including iron
(Hurrell et al. 1992) and zinc (L€
onnerdal 2000). Iron and
zinc deficiency can have devastating effects in children=fe-
tuses. Iron deficiency in infancy leads to impaired process-
ing speed, affect, learning, and memory (Fretham, Carlson,
and Georgieff 2011). Zinc deficiency during pregnancy
increases the risk of preterm delivery. In children it can
impair growth, cause hypogonadism in males, neurosensory
disorders, and other problems (Nishi 1996; Prasad 1988).
The AND acknowledges that the high phytate content of
vegetarian diets interferes with iron and zinc absorption,
and that the bioavailability of the nonheme iron of plants,
dairy, and eggs is lower than that of heme iron in meat and
seafood (Melina, Craig, and Levin 2016). But the danger of
deficiency, particularly in regard to iron, may be greater
than the AND suggests in its position statement.
Studies on vegetarians have generally shown them to be
at much greater risk for iron deficiency. Although most
studies show that vegetarians=vegans tend to have a similar
or higher daily intake of iron compared with omnivores, the
former tend to have significantly lower mean serum ferritin
concentrations due to the lower bioavailability of iron in the
vegetarian diet (see, e.g., Baines, Powers, and Brown 2007;
Ball and Bartlett 1999; Pawlak and Bell 2017; Snyder,
Dvorak, and Roepke 1989; Wilson and Ball 1999). Wilson
and Ball (1999), for example, found that among Australian
men, iron intake among vegetarians and vegans was 29–49%
CRITICAL REVIEWS IN FOOD SCIENCE AND NUTRITION

 higher than that of omnivores, but their serum ferritin con-
centrations were much lower: Vegetarians had mean concen-
trations of 64, vegans 65, and omnivores 121 ng=ml. None
of the omnivores in their sample, but 20.5% of vegetarians
and 30% of vegans had low concentrations of <25 ng=ml.
3% of vegetarians and 25% of vegans were technically defi-
cient, with ferritin concentrations <12 ng=ml. The other
studies cited above report similar findings.
Most studies find vegetarians=vegans to have a zinc
intake that is similar to omnivores, and to have a slightly to
moderately elevated risk of deficiency. Low serum zinc levels
can be caused in both vegetarians and omnivores by high
phytate
intake
(Bindra,
Gibson,
and
Thompson
1986;
Donovan
and
Gibson
1995;
though
see
Ball
and
Ackland 2000).
Eggs
Eggs are a high-quality source of protein and are high in
iron and zinc. They may be promising as a substitute for
meat. However, there are a few reasons to question whether
it would be healthy for pregnant women and children to
rely on eggs as a primary source of these nutrients.
One whole egg contains approximately 1 mg nonheme
iron and 1 mg zinc, corresponding to around 10% of the
USDA’s recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for each of
these minerals for children aged 9–12. Because the iron in
eggs is of the less bioavailable nonheme form, and because
egg consumption itself reduces iron absorption (Hallberg
and Hulth�
en 2000), children would have to consume some-
what more than the RDA of iron from eggs in order to
meet their requirements. An egg contains 6 g protein, which
is 11% of the RDA for males 14 years and older. Children
who are relying on eggs as a major source—or even their
primary source—of protein, iron, and zinc will (depending
on their age, sex, and body size) have to eat several every
day in order to meet the USDA’s recommendations. This
may be an unrealistic dietary plan.
The n�6=n�3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ratio in
eggs is a little over 15:1, and eggs would therefore contribute
to the already high n�6=n�3 PUFA ratio of the vegetarian
diet. As shall be discussed below, there is a possibility that a
high n�6=n�3 ratio promotes chronic systemic inflamma-
tion and the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.
Potential deficiencies and their consequences for
brain and body development
As mentioned in the previous section, the AND acknowl-
edges that vegetarians must pay close attention to iron and
zinc intake (Melina, Craig, and Levin 2016), though its pos-
ition statement may underestimate the risk of deficiency.
This section discusses vegetarians’ risk of deficiencies in
vitamin B12, creatine, taurine, and long-chain n�3 PUFAs,
which
could
have
serious
consequences
for
children.
Although the AND notes that vegetarian diets are low in
B12 and long-chain n�3 PUFAs, it may underestimate the
risk of B12 deficiency and the negative consequences of
lower long-chain n�3 fatty acid intake in children.
Vitamin B12
Herrmann et al. (2003) found vitamin B12 deficiency—
defined as concentrations <156 pmol=L—in 26% of adult
vegetarians, 52% of vegans, and 1% of omnivores. Average
levels for vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores were 148, 192,
and 287 pmol=L, respectively. 148 pmol=L is considered
clinically deficient in the U.S., but symptoms of deficiency
are known to occur at “marginal” levels of 148–221 pmol=L
(Allen 2009). This would place the average vegetarian and
vegan in the range for potentially experiencing negative con-
sequences due to low B12 levels. It should be noted that the
subjects in Herrmann et al.’s study were recruited from a
conference of the German Federation of Vegetarians and a
Vegan Society summer camp in the Netherlands, so there is
reason to think that these vegetarians and vegans had an
above-average amount of nutrition education. Indeed, 20%
of vegetarians and 59% of vegans in their study reported
taking vitamin B supplements, which did improve their B12
status. There was no significant difference between the B12
levels of vegetarians who took supplements and omnivores,
which was in part due to extremely high levels among some
vegetarians taking supplements. Vegans who took supple-
ments still had a marginally low average level of 192, rang-
ing from 125 to 299 pmol=L. (The lowest level among an
omnivore in their study was 190 pmol=L.)
The
AND
says
that
“[v]egans
must
regularly
consume … B-12-fortified
foods
or
B-12-containing
sup-
plements,” and “[m]ost vegetarians should” do the same
(Melina, Craig, and Levin 2016). The results of Herrmann
et al. (2003) suggest that even with supplementation vegans
may still tend to cluster in the deficient-to-borderline-defi-
cient range. Vegetarians can achieve adequate B12 levels with
supplementation, but some are still in the deficient and bor-
derline-deficient range. Whether it is realistic for vegeta-
rians=vegans to maintain adequate B12 levels throughout their
entire childhood via supplementation is an open question.
The consequences of B12 deficiency in childhood for
brain and body development are extensive, severe, and can
be irreversible. Potential consequences include (among many
others) impaired cognitive development=school performance,
depression, weakness, fatigue, nerve damage, and failure to
thrive
(Graham,
Arvela,
and
Wise
1992;
Rasmussen,
Fernhoff, and Scanlon 2001). Breastfeeding infants whose
mothers are vegetarian=vegan are also known to be at risk
for B12 deficiency (Graham, Arvela, and Wise 1992; K€
uhne,
Bubl, and Baumgartner 1991; Roschitz et al. 2005; von
Schenck, Bender-G€
otze, and Koletzko 1997).
Creatine
Creatine is rarely mentioned in discussions of the health
consequences of vegetarianism. However, there is some lit-
tle-known evidence that creatine consumption may play an
important role in cognitive functioning.

N. COFNAS
 In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, Rae et al.
(2003) found that 6 weeks of oral creatine supplementation
significantly improved the performance of vegetarians on a
timed Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices test (RAPM—
a measure of fluid intelligence) and the backward digit span
task (a measure of working memory). The difference in per-
formance between the control and the creatine-supple-
mented
vegetarians
was
enormous.
On
RAPM,
the
treatment group scored slightly more than 1 standard devi-
ation higher than the control. There was an approximately 1
standard deviation difference between the treatment and the
control group on the backward digit span task: The former
could recall on average 8.5 items (SD ¼ 1.76) while the lat-
ter could recall on average 7.05 (SD ¼ 1.19). However,
Rawson et al. (2008) found that creatine supplementation
had no effect on RAPM or backward digit span task perform-
ance for meat eaters, suggesting that vegetarians have
impaired scores due to low creatine intake.
Gale et al. (2007) found that 30-year-olds in Britain who
identified as vegetarian (33.6% of whom admitted to eating
fish or chicken) had, at age 10, a mean IQ of 104.8 com-
pared with a mean of approximately 100 for the general
population. At age 10, vegans had a mean IQ of 95.1
(though the sample size for vegans was low). But, to reiter-
ate, Gale et al. report the IQ of 30-year-old vegetarians when
they were 10-year-olds. Rae et al.’s (2003) findings suggest
that vegetarianism reduces performance on tests that have a
strong relationship with IQ. It is possible that, although
vegetarianism appeals to people with higher intelligence,
becoming vegetarian reduces fluid intelligence and working
memory. Consistent with this possibility, Gale et al. (2007)
report that although vegetarians were 2.4 times as likely as
omnivores to have higher academic degrees or vocational
qualifications, the former had no advantage in terms of
annual income—in fact they were slightly overrepresented in
the lowest income bracket and underrepresented in the
highest. Gale et al. suggest that vegetarians may choose
lower paying jobs because of “ethical considerations,” and
note that vegetarians are more likely to agree with the state-
ment that “The government should redistribute income.”
However, other studies have found that agreeing with redis-
tributionist policies is associated with a lower IQ (Carl 2014;
Kanazawa 2010).
The findings reviewed so far provide suggestive evidence
that the lack of creatine intake among vegetarians lowers
fluid intelligence and working memory by approximately 1
standard deviation, corresponding to about 15 IQ points.
People may not notice a reduction in cognitive functioning
when they become vegetarian if fluid but not crystallized
intelligence is affected. (That is to say, becoming vegetarian-
ism may impair one’s ability to solve problems without
causing one to forget what one has learned, so the effect
may not be noticeable.) The results from Rae et al. (2003)
suggest that the impairment is to some extent reversible in
adults by means of supplementation, and would presumably
be reversible by eating meat.
There is direct evidence that childhood creatine levels
affect not only performance on cognitive tests, but also real-
life labor market outcomes in adulthood. As part of the
Young Finns Study in 1980, researchers measured the urin-
ary concentrations of creatinine in 3,596 Finns aged 3–18.
(Creatinine is a breakdown product of creatine, and so the
former is a proxy for the latter.) B€
ockerman et al. (2017)
found a significant relationship between subjects’ creatinine
levels in 1980 and their income 20 years later. A one SD
increase in creatinine corresponded to an increase of 7.36%
in earnings. As the authors note, since urinary creatinine
levels do not perfectly reflect actual creatine levels, their
results probably underestimate the true effect of creatine.
While impaired creatine metabolism has been linked to
psychiatric disorders (Allen 2012), whether chronic low cre-
atine intake in childhood has nonreversible negative effects
on brain development has not been studied. We cannot say
for sure whether long-term creatine supplementation for
vegetarian or vegan children would be a solution to this
potential problem. (The AND’s 2016 statement does not
mention creatine, though its 2009 statement said that
“vegetarian athletes may have lower muscle creatine concen-
tration [and] may benefit from creatine supplementation”
[Craig and Mangels 2009]. Neither the 2016 nor the 2009
statement mentions the possible consequences of chronic
low creatine intake for physical and mental development,
which are in fact unknown.)
Taurine
As to the significance of taurine, Wu and Prentice (2010)
report: “Taurine demonstrates multiple cellular functions
including a central role as a neurotransmitter, as a trophic
factor in CNS development, in maintaining the structural
integrity of the membrane, in regulating calcium transport
and homeostasis, as an osmolyte, as a neuromodulator and
as a neuroprotectant.” Vegetarians and especially vegans
have low taurine intake and, consequently, low levels of
plasma taurine and urinary taurine excretion (Laidlaw et al.
1988). The effects of chronically low levels of taurine intake
as seen in vegetarians and vegans are largely unknown,
though there is some direct evidence that low levels in
infancy—even if they are within the normal range—may
impair brain development. Wharton et al. (2004) found that
“[l]ow plasma neonatal taurine was associated with lower
scores on the Bayley mental development index at 18 months
and the WISC-R arithmetic subtest at 7 years.” They suggest
that dietary taurine intake may be responsible for the bene-
fits of breast milk for neurodevelopment. If they are right,
then consuming breastmilk from mothers with low taurine
intake, including vegetarians=vegans (Rana and Sanders
1986), may put infants at risk for impaired neurodevelop-
ment. Low taurine levels during pregnancy may have an
effect on fetal development.

 (DHA). Vegetarians can obtain some DHA from eggs
(Davis and Kris-Etherton 2003). However, a small percent-
age of ingested alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) from plants can
be converted to EPA and DHA through endogenous proc-
esses. Rosell et al. (2005) found that, compared with omni-
vores, vegetarians had plasma concentrations of EPA and
DHA that were 27.8% and 31.4% lower, respectively. Plasma
concentrations in vegans were, respectively, 52.8% and
58.6%
lower
than
in
omnivores.
Investigations
by
Kornsteiner, Singer, and Elmadfa (2008) and Sanders (2009)
led to similar findings. Could there be negative consequen-
ces associated with having low levels of EPA and DHA dur-
ing childhood?
DHA is crucial for brain and retinal development, par-
ticularly in the first 2 years of life (Birch et al. 2010; Drover
et al. 2011; Echeverr�
ıa et al. 2017; Innis, Gilley, and Werker
2001; McCann and Ames 2005; Uauy and Dangour 2006).
Both DHA and EPA deficiencies are linked to a variety of
neurocognitive disorders including “attention-deficit hyper-
activity disorder (ADHD), dyslexia, dyspraxia and autism
spectrum disorders” (Schuchardt et al. 2010).
The AND states:
The clinical relevance of reduced EPA and DHA status among
vegetarians and vegans is unknown. Long-chain n�3 fatty acids
are important for the development and maintenance of the
brain,
retina,
and
cell
membranes
and
favorably
impact
pregnancy outcomes and risk for [some] chronic diseases. Yet,
vegetarian and vegan children do not appear to experience
impairment in visual or mental development … . (Melina, Craig,
and Levin 2016)
But since, as the AND itself says, the significance of the
low EPA and DHA status among vegetarians is “unknown,”
it does not seem justified to say definitively that there is no
risk. Some indirect evidence suggests that low EPA and
DHA levels in vegetarian children could be associated
with risks.
Supplementation with plant-based sources of ALA (such
as flaxseed oil) can improve the EPA levels of vegetarians
and vegans, but may have little or no effect on DHA levels
(Lane et al. 2014). The AND suggests that vegetarians who
are pregnant or lactating or who have reduced conversion
ability due to disease could benefit from “[l]ow-dose micro-
algae-based DHA supplements” (Melina, Craig, and Levin
2016). (Recently algae-based supplements containing EPA
have also been developed.). However, the below-normal lev-
els of EPA and DHA typically found in vegetarians could
potentially put children at risk for impaired brain and CNS
development.
Mental health
There is currently an epidemic of depression among young
people in developed countries, including the U.S. (Kessler
et al. 2005; Nesse 2000). Supplementation with EPA (but
not DHA) has been shown to significantly improve depres-
sion (Martins 2009; Sublette et al. 2011). A recent meta-ana-
lysis found an association between low fish intake and
depression, presumably due to the high EPA content of fish
(Li, Liu, and Zhang 2016). This gives some reason to believe
that young vegetarians and vegans, who consume very little
EPA or none at all, may be at increased risk for depression.
In fact, there is empirical evidence linking vegetarianism
(and low meat consumption) to depression and to contem-
plating and attempting suicide in adolescents (Larsson et al.
2002; Perry et al. 2001).
n26=n23 PUFA ratio
Hunter–gatherers consume n�6 and n�3 fatty acids in a
ratio of about 1:1, while Westerners consume them in a
ratio of around 15:1 or higher (Simopoulos 2002a). There is
an
ongoing
controversy
about
the
significance
of
the
n�6=n�3 PUFA ratio in the diet. Some evidence seems to
connect a high ratio with chronic systemic inflammation
that can potentially lead to (or aggravate) autoimmune dis-
eases, some of which often manifest in adolescence (Harbige
2003; Kang 2003; Sierra et al. 2006; Simopoulos 2002a, b,
2008). Controlling for ethnicity, populations that consume
relatively little n�6 relative to n�3 PUFA have low rates of
autoimmune diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease,
relative to Western=Westernized populations (Simopoulos
2002b). The anti-inflammatory properties of n�3 fatty acids
appear to be due largely to EPA and DHA rather than ALA
(Mori and Beilin 2004).
Some evidence suggests that consuming high levels of
n�3 fatty acids (especially EPA and DHA) in conjunction
with n�6 fatty acids leads to anti-inflammatory effects
regardless of the ratio (Pischon et al. 2003). Whether the
ratio itself, or only the amount of EPA and DHA consumed,
is the crucial factor in reducing inflammation has not
been resolved.
Vegetarian
and
vegan
diets
necessarily
have
high
n�6=n�3 PUFA ratios (Kornsteiner, Singer, and Elmadfa
2008). Rosell et al. (2005) found the ratio of plasma levels of
linoleic acid to EPA þ DHA in British omnivores, vegeta-
rians, and vegans to be 12.6, 20.0, and 35.7, respectively.
Again, the possibility that the high ratio is harmful per se is
not settled science. But we also cannot say decisively that
this is not harmful. The AND’s position statement on vege-
tarianism does not address the question of the n�6=n�3
PUFA ratio. In any case, low EPA and DHA intake appears
to lead to chronic systemic inflammation regardless of the
ratio. Thus, it is possible that the low intake of EPA and
DHA, perhaps in conjunction with a high intake of n�6
fatty acids, in vegetarians might increase the risk of develop-
ing autoimmune diseases such as Crohn’s disease, ulcerative
colitis, psoriasis, and lupus in childhood or adolescence.
Conclusion
This paper has reviewed direct and indirect evidence that
vegetarian and vegan diets may be associated with serious
risks for fetuses and growing children. This evidence for the
dangers
of
vegetarianism
is
not
necessarily
decisive.
However, the question is whether the AND is justified in
making a blanket claim that “appropriately planned” vege-
tarian and vegan diets that substitute milk, soy=legumes, or
6
N. COFNAS
 eggs for meat are as healthy as appropriately planned
omnivorous diets for children. The evidence reviewed here
suggests that there are still many unknowns about the health
effects of meatless diets in children. Parents ought to be
informed that the debate about the health effects of vegetar-
ianism in children is not settled one way or the other.
