Abstract Insulin resistance in muscle, adipocytes and liver is a gateway to a number of
metabolic diseases. Here, we show a selective deficiency in mitochondrial coenzyme Q (CoQ) in
insulin-resistant adipose and muscle tissue. This defect was observed in a range of in vitro insulin
resistance models and adipose tissue from insulin-resistant humans and was concomitant with
lower expression of mevalonate/CoQ biosynthesis pathway proteins in most models.
Pharmacologic or genetic manipulations that decreased mitochondrial CoQ triggered mitochondrial
oxidants and insulin resistance while CoQ supplementation in either insulin-resistant cell models or
mice restored normal insulin sensitivity. Specifically, lowering of mitochondrial CoQ caused insulin
resistance in adipocytes as a result of increased superoxide/hydrogen peroxide production via
complex II. These data suggest that mitochondrial CoQ is a proximal driver of mitochondrial
oxidants and insulin resistance, and that mechanisms that restore mitochondrial CoQ may be
effective therapeutic targets for treating insulin resistance.

Introduction
Insulin resistance is a major risk factor for several metabolic diseases including type two diabetes.
This defect is found in all metabolic tissues most notably adipose tissue, muscle and liver. While insu-
lin resistance in adipose and muscle tissue is likely to occur in a cell autonomous manner recent

 evidence suggests that liver insulin resistance may occur via a mechanism involving defects in adi-
pose tissue (Perry et al., 2015; Titchenell et al., 2016).
A range of perturbations have been shown to trigger insulin resistance including diets high in fat
and/or sucrose (Boden et al., 2015; Samocha-Bonet et al., 2012; Turner et al., 2013), hyperinsuli-
naemia, hyperlipidaemia (Roden et al., 1996), inflammation (Hotamisligil et al., 1994), corticoste-
roids (Houstis et al., 2006; Kusunoki et al., 1995). These insults may cause insulin resistance via
distinct means indicating that insulin resistance maybe a heterogeneous disorder. For example,
stresses such as lipotoxicity (Chavez et al., 2003; Griffin et al., 1999), endoplasmic reticulum stress
(Ozcan et al., 2004), mitochondrial dysfunction (Kelley et al., 2002; Montgomery and Turner,
2015)
and
mitochondrial
oxidative
stress
(Anderson
et
al.,
2009;
Hoehn
et
al.,
2009;
Houstis et al., 2006) have all been reported to play a causal role in insulin resistance. However, we
and others have shown that mitochondrial oxidative stress is a common feature of many in vitro insu-
lin resistance models (Hoehn et al., 2008; Houstis et al., 2006) and metabolic tissues both from
mice
and
humans
(Anderson
et
al.,
2009;
Paglialunga
et
al.,
2015),
and
in
humans
(Anderson et al., 2009). Further, many cellular stresses associated with insulin resistance such as
ceramides (Garcı
´a-Ruiz et al., 1997) and endoplasmic reticulum stress (Malhotra and Kaufman,
2007) may also increase mitochondrial oxidant production. Despite this evidence for mitochondrial
oxidants being a common feature and cause of insulin resistance the molecular mechanisms that trig-
ger increased oxidant production in mitochondria as well as the precise source of these oxidants
remain unclear.
In the present study, we have performed global analysis of the proteome and transcriptome in
insulin-resistant adipose tissue from mice and humans and in a range of insulin resistance models in
cultured adipocyte models including hyperinsulinaemia, inflammation, and glucocorticoids in an
eLife digest After we eat, our blood sugar levels increase. To counteract this, the pancreas
releases a hormone called insulin. Part of insulin’s effect is to promote the uptake of sugar from the
blood into muscle and fat tissue for storage. Under certain conditions, such as obesity, this process
can become defective, leading to a condition known as insulin resistance. This condition makes a
number of human diseases more likely to develop, including type 2 diabetes. Working out how
insulin resistance develops could therefore unveil new treatment strategies for these diseases.
Mitochondria – structures that produce most of a cell’s energy supply – appear to play a role in
the development of insulin resistance. Mitochondria convert nutrients such as fats and sugars into
molecules called ATP that fuel the many processes required for life. However, ATP production can
also generate potentially harmful intermediates often referred to as ‘reactive oxygen species’ or
‘oxidants’. Previous studies have suggested that an increase in the amount of oxidants produced in
mitochondria can cause insulin resistance.
Fazakerley et al. therefore set out to identify the reason for increased oxidants in mitochondria,
and did so by analysing the levels of proteins and oxidants found in cells grown in the laboratory,
and mouse and human tissue samples. This led them to find that concentrations of a molecule called
coenzyme Q (CoQ), an essential component of mitochondria that helps to produce ATP, were lower
in mitochondria from insulin-resistant fat and muscle tissue. Further experiments suggested a link
between the lower levels of CoQ and the higher levels of oxidants in the mitochondria. Replenishing
the mitochondria of the lab-grown cells and insulin-resistant mice with CoQ restored ‘normal’
oxidant levels and prevented the development of insulin resistance.
Strategies that aim to increase mitochondria CoQ levels may therefore prevent or reverse insulin
resistance. Although CoQ supplements are readily available, swallowing CoQ does not efficiently
deliver CoQ to mitochondria in humans, so alternative treatment methods must be found. It is also
of interest that statins, common drugs taken by millions of people around the world to lower
cholesterol, also lower CoQ and have been reported to increase the risk of developing type 2
diabetes. Further research is therefore needed to investigate whether CoQ might provide the link
between statins and type 2 diabetes.

 effort to identify changes that may contribute to mitochondrial oxidant production. The mevalonate/
coenzyme Q (CoQ) biosynthesis pathway was altered in all models, and this was accompanied by a
selective decrease in mitochondrial CoQ content in all models of adipocyte insulin resistance as well
as in human adipose tissue and in insulin-resistant muscle from mice fed a high fat high sucrose diet.
Loss of mitochondrial CoQ was both necessary and sufficient to drive complex II-dependent mito-
chondrial oxidant production and adipocyte insulin resistance. Our data provide evidence for
decreased mitochondrial CoQ content and resultant generation of oxidants being a convergent
pathway for many different models of insulin resistance.
Results
Insulin resistance models
To identify pathways that may contribute to insulin resistance in adipose tissue we used unbiased
proteomics to specifically look for factors or pathways that: (a) change across a range of insulin-resis-
tant models including in humans, and (b) that have a demonstrable link to mitochondrial redox
homeostasis. The models studied included adipose tissue from mice fed a high fat high sucrose diet
(HFHSD) for different periods of time and three in vitro models of insulin resistance (3T3-L1 adipo-
cytes treated with chronic insulin, dexamethasone or tumour necrosis factor-a). We initially focussed
on adipose tissue as our tissue of interest for two main reasons. First, adipose tissue insulin resis-
tance is found in mice and humans that display whole body insulin resistance and insulin resistance
at this site can influence whole body insulin sensitivity (Abel et al., 2001; Sugii et al., 2009). Second,
there are highly robust in vitro adipocyte models (3T3-L1 cells) that accurately recapitulate both insu-
lin action and the generation of insulin resistance using a range of insults that mimic perturbations
implicated in insulin resistance in vivo such as hyperinsulinemia, inflammation and glucocorticoids.
These models are invaluable since they provide a highly controlled system for manipulating insulin
sensitivity in a cell autonomous manner.
Mice fed a HFHSD for one day were glucose intolerant and the extent of glucose intolerance pla-
teaued by 14 d (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B). Adipose tissue insulin resistance was
observed by 5 d and this degree of resistance was maintained to 42 d of HFHSD feeding
(Figure 1A, Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). Skeletal muscle exhibited a comparatively delayed
onset of insulin resistance consistent with previous studies (Turner et al., 2013), but also reached a
maximal observed insulin resistance by 14 d (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). Insulin resistance in
in vitro models was defined by impaired HA-GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane
(Figure 1B) and insulin-mediated 2-deoxyglucose (2DOG) uptake (Figure 1—figure supplement
1E). Together, these models provided an ideal integrated platform with which to explore drivers of
insulin resistance.
Proteomic analysis of insulin resistance
Proteomic analyses of insulin-resistant adipose tissue and 3T3-L1 adipocytes provided quantitative
data on 2981 and 3494 proteins, respectively (Figure 1C–D, Supplementary file 1-tabs A, C), 98 of
which were altered at both 5 and 14 d HFHSD time points (Figure 1—figure supplement 1F, top
right panel, Supplementary file 1- tab A) and 491 in �2 in vitro models (Figure 1—figure supple-
ment 1F, left panel, Supplementary file 1-tab C). A small subset of these (19) were common to
both analyses (Figure 1—figure supplement 1F, bottom right panel, Figure 1—figure supplement
1.L ) including the LRP1 chaperone LRPAP1, which is of interest because LRP1 regulates GLUT4 traf-
ficking in adipocytes (Jedrychowski et al., 2010). From gene set enrichment analysis, 13 pathways
were altered at both time points in adipose tissue from HFHSD mice (Figure 1—figure supplement
1G, top right panel, Supplementary file 1-tab E). Similarly, there was a high degree of overlap in
altered pathways across different in vitro models (Figure 1—figure supplement 1G, left panel,
Supplementary file 1-tab E). Ten pathways were overlapping between all models (Figure 1—figure
supplement 1G, bottom right panel, Figure 1—figure supplement 1.M). Intriguingly, parallel analy-
sis of gene expression in these models revealed minimal overlap between regulated transcripts and
proteins in all models (Figure 1—figure supplement 1I–K, Supplementary file 2). For example, of
the 98 proteins altered at both 5 and 14 d HFHSD only 12 were altered at the mRNA level (Fig-
ure 1—figure supplement 1H, Supplementary file 2-tab A), and there was limited concordance

 between changes in proteins and transcript expression for the 19 proteins and 10 pathways found to
be altered in both in vivo and in vitro models (Figure 1—figure supplement 1L–M). This lack of con-
cordance between gene and protein expression emphasises how crucial proteomic analyses are in
identifying causal links to metabolic disease.
Integrated analysis of insulin-resistant proteomes
To identify convergent changes in pathways at the proteome-level that correlated with insulin resis-
tance across all adipocyte models, we generated a combined z-score for pathways across in vivo
time points and in vitro models (Figure 1E). There were 13 KEGG pathways (excluding disease path-
ways) that were highly altered (z-score >4) in in vivo and in vitro analyses. Oxidative phosphorylation
was most highly altered in both in vivo and in vitro models, and other pathways of interest included
TCA cycle, branched chain amino acid metabolism (valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation),

Proteomic analysis of human adipose insulin resistance
To further filter pathways that might be implicated in insulin resistance, we next performed proteo-
mic analysis of adipose tissue from a cohort of
obese subjects that have been extensively clini-
cally
phenotyped
(Chen
et
al.,
2015).
This
cohort was matched for BMI and comprised
insulin- sensitive and insulin-resistant subjects
based on responses during a hyperinsulinaemic-
euglycaemic clamp, meaning that we could iden-
tity pathways related to insulin sensitivity inde-
pendent of obesity/BMI (Chen et al., 2015). We
quantified 4481 proteins across 22 subjects and
correlated
the
expression
of
proteins
(Supplementary file 3- tab A) and pathways
(Supplementary file 3- tab B) with clinical fea-
tures that are diagnostic of insulin sensitivity. For
the purposes of this exercise, we focused on
suppression of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs)
during the clamp as this is likely to be more
directly related to insulin action in adipose tissue
than glucose infusion rate (GIR), which is likely
driven mainly by muscle. We identified 299 pro-
teins (Supplementary file 3- tab A) and 26 path-
ways (Supplementary file 3- tab B) that were
positively correlated with insulin sensitivity and
142 proteins and two pathways (ribosome, spli-
ceosome) that were negatively correlated with
insulin
sensitivity
(r
=
<�0.423
or
>0.423)
(Supplementary file 3- tabs A, B). Importantly,
the PPAR signalling pathway, a known regulator
of adipose insulin sensitivity (Sugii et al., 2009),
was positively associated with insulin sensitivity
in this analysis. Of the 13 pathways of interest
from the integrated proteomic analysis of insulin
resistance models (Figure 1E) only five were
positively associated with insulin sensitivity in
human
adipose
tissue
(Figure
1F,
Supplementary file 3-tab B). These comprised
spliceosome, central carbon metabolism (pyru-
vate metabolism, TCA cycle, glycolysis, pentose
phosphate pathway), amino acid metabolism
including branched chain amino acid synthesis/
degradation and the terpenoid backbone bio-
synthesis/mevalonate pathway, which generates
precursors for isoprenoids such as cholesterol
and CoQ. This is of interest as branched chain
amino acid metabolism (Newgard et al., 2009)
and spliceosome function (Vernia et al., 2016)
have been implicated in adipocyte or whole
body insulin sensitivity, providing support for our
analysis pipeline.

 The mevalonate and coenzyme Q biosynthesis pathways are altered in
insulin resistance
We were particularly interested in the potential role of the mevalonate pathway in insulin resistance
because this pathway feeds CoQ biosynthesis, an essential component of mitochondrial electron
transport and so defects in this pathway might play a role in mitochondrial oxidative stress. Our data
revealed changes in transcripts and proteins throughout the mevalonate pathway (Figure 2, Fig-
ure 2—figure supplement 1, Supplementary file 1- tabs A-E, Supplementary file 2- tabs A-E,
Supplementary file 3- tabs A-B), but when assessing different endpoints of the mevalonate pathway
such as cholesterol, N-glycosylation (dolichol) and CoQ, we only observed altered protein expression
in components of the CoQ pathway in both human and mouse adipose tissue (Figure 2). COQ7 and
COQ9 were lower in insulin-resistant adipose tissue from humans and mice (Figure 2), while
ADCK3/COQ8 was dysregulated at the protein and mRNA levels in vitro (Figure 2—figure supple-
ment 1). Our integrated analysis of insulin-resistant proteomes from in vivo and in vitro models, and
human, pointed toward a convergence upon dysregulated CoQ biosynthesis in insulin resistance.
Mitochondrial CoQ content is decreased selectively in insulin resistance
We next determined if the change in expression of mevalonate/CoQ pathway proteins translated
into altered CoQ metabolism. To do this, we measured total CoQ content in in vivo and in vitro
models of adipocyte insulin resistance. Whole-cell CoQ concentrations were decreased in in vitro
models (Figure 3A) but not in insulin-resistant adipose tissue (Figure 3B). We postulated that
because CoQ is found in membranes throughout the cell that there might be a selective depletion
of CoQ in specific locations, for example in mitochondria where it is synthesised. To investigate this,
we analysed CoQ in subcellular fractions from 3T3-L1 adipocytes and adipose tissue. This revealed a
selective depletion of CoQ in mitochondria across all models (Figure 3C–D, Figure 3—figure sup-
plement 1A–B). This decrease was not due to changes in mitochondrial content (assessed via citrate
synthase
activity
and
OXPHOS
subunit
abundance;
Figure
3—figure
supplement
1C–J,
Supplementary file 2- tabs A-D). Consistent with data from model systems, adipose tissue mito-
chondrial CoQ10 (the major form of CoQ in humans) was positively correlated with insulin-induced
suppression of NEFAs (Figure 3E–F, Table 1) and whole-body insulin sensitivity (GIR) in obese
humans (Figure 3—figure supplement 1K–L, Table 1). Mitochondrial CoQ10 was also significantly
and positively correlated with expression of proteins in the CoQ biosynthesis pathway (r =+0.52)
(Supplementary file 3-tab B) indicating that decreased biosynthesis may contribute to lower mito-
chondrial CoQ in insulin resistance. Stratification of participants by adipose tissue mitochondrial
CoQ10 revealed no effect of age or BMI (Table 1). These findings reveal that decreases in mitochon-
drial CoQ are an obesity-independent feature of adipocyte insulin resistance.
Intriguingly, our proteomic data indicated that the expression of proteins integral to the mevalo-
nate pathway was decreased in fat from humans and mice and from 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with
dexamethasone or TNF-a whereas this was not the case in the chronic insulin 3T3-L1 adipocyte
model (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Thus, we next examined if the observed decrease in mito-
chondrial CoQ reflected changes in CoQ biosynthesis, which we measured by determining 13C6-
CoQ9 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes incubated with 13C6-4-hydroxybenzoic acid. Consistent with pathway
analysis and our intracellular measures of cholesterol content (Figure 3—figure supplement 1M–P),
CoQ biosynthesis rates were lower in cells treated with dexamethasone or TNF-a but elevated in
response to chronic insulin (Figure 3—figure supplement 1Q). Together, it appears probable that
dexamethasone and TNF-a treatments lower mitochondrial CoQ largely via reduced biosynthesis,
although increased CoQ in microsomal and PM subcellular fractions (Figure 3—figure supplement
1A–B) in these models point to additional dysregulation of CoQ trafficking. Since these models repli-
cate the lower content of mevalonate/CoQ biosynthesis pathway proteins measured in mice and
humans, it is likely that decreased CoQ biosynthesis contributes to loss of CoQ in these more physi-
ological systems. This does not appear to be the case for adipocytes treated with chronic insulin,
where additional pathway(s) likely contribute to dysregulated mitochondrial CoQ homeostasis.
The above findings highlight loss of mitochondrial CoQ as a common feature of adipocyte insulin
resistance so we next investigated if a similar phenomenon occurs in other insulin responsive tissues,
most notably muscle in view of its major role in whole body glucose metabolism/insulin resistance. In
muscle, we found decreased mitochondrial CoQ at 14 and 42 d HFHSD feeding (Figure 3G). These

 time points correlate with the emergence of insulin resistance in muscle (Figure 1—figure supple-
ment 1D). In contrast to adipose tissue, total muscle CoQ was lower at all time points tested (Fig-
ure 3—figure supplement 1R), potentially reflecting higher mitochondrial content of this tissue.
Liver mitochondrial CoQ was unchanged in response to HFHSD feeding (Figure 3—figure supple-
ment 1S), despite changes in total CoQ at 5 d HFHSD feeding (Figure 3—figure supplement 1T).
Changes in cholesterol content in in vitro models (Figure 3—figure supplement 1M–P), adipose tis-
sue (Figure 3—figure supplement 1U), muscle (Figure 3—figure supplement 1V) and liver (Fig-
ure 3—figure supplement 1W) were inconsistent with a causal role in insulin resistance across
multiple tissues. These data suggest that a decrease in mitochondrial CoQ may be involved at an
early stage in the development of insulin resistance in muscle and adipose tissue.

 Supplementation of CoQ restores mitochondrial CoQ and insulin
sensitivity
To test whether loss of CoQ contributes to insulin resistance in adipocytes and muscle, we first
examined whether restoration of mitochondrial CoQ could restore insulin sensitivity in 3T3-L1 adipo-
cytes. Addition of CoQ9 had no effect in control cells but increased mitochondrial CoQ9 in insulin-
resistant cells (Figure 4A) and both CoQ9 and CoQ10 improved insulin-stimulated HA-GLUT4 trans-
location and 2DOG uptake in all cell models (Figure 4B, Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B). In
light of the importance of adipocyte lipolysis in whole body glucose homeostasis (Perry et al., 2015;
Titchenell et al., 2016), we next tested whether CoQ could also improve insulin-regulated suppres-
sion of lipolysis in these models. Dex or TNFa treatment enhanced basal lipolysis as previously
described (Souza et al., 1998; Xu et al., 2009) and insulin-regulated inhibition of lipolysis was
defective in all models (Figure 4C, Figure 4—figure supplement 1C–E). Provision of CoQ9 had no
effect in control cells but increased suppression of lipolysis by insulin in in vitro models (albeit not
significantly in the TNF model; p=0.11).
We next tested whether CoQ could alleviate insulin resistance in vivo by providing liposomal
CoQ10 via intraperitoneal injection every second day. CoQ10 was used for these studies as it was not
feasible to obtain sufficient CoQ9 and the doses of CoQ10 used in these studies were optimised so
that we did not observe changes in body weight or adiposity, reported previously (Xu et al., 2017),
since such metabolic changes would likely directly affect insulin action in muscle and adipose. CoQ10
administration improved whole-body glucose tolerance in mice fed a HFHSD for 5 or 14 d
(Figure 4D–E, Figure 4—figure supplement 1F–G) without altering insulin secretion (Figure 4F,
Figure 4—figure supplement 1H). Improved glucose tolerance was accompanied by increased sup-
pression of NEFAs (Figure 4G, Figure 4—figure supplement 1I) and 2DOG clearance into epididy-
mal (Figure 4—figure supplement 1J) and inguinal (Figure 4—figure supplement 1K, p=0.06)
adipose depots and quadriceps (Figure 4—figure supplement 1L, p=0.08) during the GTT. In a

 more direct measure of insulin sensitivity in vivo, CoQ10 also increased insulin responsiveness of
HFHSD-fed mice during an ITT as measured by blood glucose excursion (Figure 4H) and 2DOG
uptake into epididymal and inguinal fat pads and quadriceps muscle (Figure 4I–K).
Adipose depots retain a high degree of insulin responsiveness and insulin resistance ex vivo (Fig-
ure 1—figure supplement 1C, Figure 4L). Therefore, we used adipose tissue for ex vivo analyses
rather than muscle tissue, for which ex vivo analyses are more technically challenging and give less
robust responses (data not shown). Administration of increasing doses of CoQ10 to HFHSD-fed mice
for 14 d dose-dependently increased CoQ10 in mitochondria from epididymal adipose tissue (Fig-
ure 4—figure supplement 1M), improved glucose tolerance (Figure 4—figure supplement 1N–O)
and improved insulin-stimulated 2DOG uptake in an ex vivo assay using adipose tissue explants
(Figure 4L). CoQ10 did not alter whole body or epididymal fat pad mass (Figure 4—figure supple-
ment 1P–Q). Together, these data suggest that provision of exogenous CoQ improves insulin-regu-
lated glucose uptake and that lower CoQ content may contribute to insulin resistance in adipose
tissue and muscle.
Inhibition of CoQ synthesis induces insulin resistance
Our previous data shows that lower mitochondrial CoQ content is a common feature of insulin resis-
tance and that replacing CoQ can overcome insulin resistance. We next investigated whether spe-
cific perturbation of CoQ biosynthesis was sufficient to induce insulin resistance in adipocytes. To
achieve this, we incubated adipocytes with 4-nitrobenzoic acid (NB) or 4-cholorobenzoic acid (CB)
(Alam et al., 1975; Forsman et al., 2010) to competitively inhibit 4-hydroxybenzoate:polyprenyl
transferase (Coq2) (Figure 5A). Both inhibitors decreased mitochondrial CoQ9 (Figure 5A) to a simi-
lar extent to that observed in insulin-resistant adipocytes (Figure 3C), while CoQ9 supplementation
restored normal mitochondrial CoQ9 concentrations (Figure 5A). Importantly, both inhibitors caused
insulin resistance in adipocytes (Figure 5B–5C, Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–B) which could be
reversed with provision of CoQ. Similarly, siRNA knock down of the key regulatory proteins in CoQ
biosynthesis that were down-regulated in insulin-resistant mouse and human adipose tissue (Coq7 or
Coq9) (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–D) lowered mitochondrial CoQ9 (Figure 5D) and triggered
insulin resistance (Figure 5E–5F, Figure 5—figure supplement 1E). Insulin resistance triggered by
pharmacological or genetic inhibition of CoQ biosynthesis occurred independently of consistent
defects in insulin signalling to the key regulators of glucose transport (Akt or the Akt substrate
TBC1D4), or changes in GLUT4 expression (Figure 5—figure supplement 1F–M). Similarly, CoQ
provision did not alter signalling responses or GLUT4 expression in any in vitro models of insulin
resistance (Figure 5—figure supplement 1N–Q) despite improved insulin-stimulated HA-GLUT4
translocation, 2DOG uptake and suppression of lipolysis under these conditions (Figure 4B–C, Fig-
ure 4—figure supplement 1A). These data are consistent with previous reports that insulin resis-
tance is not driven by overt and consistent defects in proximal insulin signalling (Hoehn et al., 2008;
Tan et al., 2015).

 The link between CoQ and insulin resistance is of interest in the context of statins that target the
mevalonate pathway and have recently been shown to be associated with progression to type two
diabetes in humans (Cederberg et al., 2015; Preiss et al., 2011; Sattar et al., 2010). To begin to
explore this, we incubated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with simvastatin or atorvastatin for up to 72 hr. Both
statins lowered cellular cholesterol (Figure 5—figure supplement 1R) and CoQ content (Figure 5—
figure supplement 1S), providing proof-of-principle that lower mevalonate pathway activity influen-
ces cellular CoQ content in adipocytes. Statins induced insulin resistance (Figure 5—figure supple-
ment 1T), and this was reversed by providing CoQ9 or mevalonate (Figure 5—figure supplement
1T). Together with the observation that more specific inhibitors of the CoQ biosynthetic pathway
also trigger insulin resistance, these data provide convincing evidence that loss of CoQ is sufficient
to induce adipocyte insulin resistance, and this may contribute to off-target effects of statin therapy.
Loss of mitochondrial CoQ induces insulin resistance via increased
mitochondrial oxidants
Mitochondrial CoQ is essential for cellular respiration, as it shuttles electrons from various mem-
brane-bound/associated dehydrogenase complexes to complex III during oxidative phosphorylation.
In addition, CoQ can regulate the formation of superoxide anion radicals from the various CoQ-
interacting sites of complexes I, II and III. In this respect, excess mitochondrial CoQ above that
required for maximal respiratory flux can be thought of as an ‘electron sink’. Consistent with this
concept, previous studies have shown that modest loss of mitochondrial CoQ can be tolerated for
electron transport activity, but at the cost of increased mitochondrial oxidants (Quinzii et al., 2008).
We hypothesised that loss of CoQ in mitochondria may contribute to increased oxidants in insulin
resistance. To test this possibility, we utilised peroxiredoxin (PRDX) dimerisation as an indicator of
subcellular oxidant burden (Perkins et al., 2015). Peroxiredoxins undergo homodimerisation as part
of their mechanism to reduce hydroperoxides particularly hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Therefore, the
PRDX dimer:monomer ratio is a useful surrogate to assess subcellular H2O2 (Bayer et al., 2013).

 There was no change in the total content of PRDX1-3 in insulin-resistant models (Figure 6A, Fig-
ure 6—figure supplement 1A,C,J) and the dimer:monomer ratio of cytosolic PRDX1 and PRDX2
also remained unchanged (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–D). In contrast, the dimer:monomer
ratio of mitochondrial PRDX3 increased significantly in all in vitro models (Figure 6A–6B). Increased
dimerisation of PRDX3 was also observed under conditions of pharmacological (Figure 6C, Fig-
ure 6—figure supplement 1E) or genetic inhibition (Figure 6—figure supplement 1G–H) of CoQ
biosynthesis, with limited or no changes in PRDX2 redox state (Figure 6—figure supplement 1F,I).
Restoration of normal mitochondrial CoQ9 content by provision of exogenous CoQ9 lowered the
PRDX3 dimer:monomer ratio (Figure 6D–6E). PRDX3 dimerisation was also enhanced in insulin-resis-
tant adipose tissue at 5 and 14 d HFHSD feeding (Figure 6F, Figure 6—figure supplement 1J). In
vivo administration of CoQ10 under conditions that improved insulin sensitivity lowered the PRDX3
dimer-to-monomer ratio in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6G, Figure 6—figure supplement
1K). Together, these data place decreased mitochondrial CoQ upstream of increased mitochondrial
oxidants, most likely in the form of H2O2 in adipocyte insulin resistance.
To determine if increased mitochondrial H2O2 was necessary for loss of mitochondrial CoQ to
cause insulin resistance, we over-expressed mitochondria-targeted catalase (Figure 6—figure sup-
plement 1L) in the setting of CoQ deficiency. This lowered the PRDX3 dimer:monomer ratio in cells

 where CoQ biosynthesis was inhibited (Figure 6H Figure 6—figure supplement 1M–O), and
improved insulin responses in these conditions (Figure 6I–6J), consistent with loss of mitochondrial
CoQ causing insulin resistance via mitochondrial H2O2.
Loss of mitochondrial CoQ impairs insulin action via complex II-derived
H2O2
We next examined the effect of loss of mitochondrial CoQ on mitochondrial function and oxidant
production in more detail. Although the relationship between impaired mitochondrial function and
insulin resistance is controversial (Montgomery and Turner, 2015), we first examined whether insu-
lin resistance or loss of CoQ was associated with bioenergetic defects since CoQ plays a key role in
oxidative phosphorylation. We assessed mitochondrial respiration in all in vitro models of insulin
resistance. In control and insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 adipocytes cultured in galactose, to force ATP-pro-
duction via mitochondria (Aguer et al., 2011), we observed no defect in basal or maximal (uncou-
pler-induced) respiration (Figure 7A). Instead, basal oxygen consumption was increased in multiple
models (Figure 7A). To explore this further, we measured oxygen consumption in digitonin-permea-
bilised 3T3-L1 adipocytes to assess maximal respiratory function (Figure 7B–D, Figure 7—figure
supplement 1A). In these experiments, FAD-linked respiratory capacity assessed via succinate was
the only activity compromised in all models (Figure 7C). This defect was specific to succinate dehy-
drogenase, since oxidation of medium-chain fatty acid (i.e., octanoylcarnitine, which also donates
electrons to CoQ via electron-transferring-flavoprotein dehydrogenase [Ruzicka and Beinert,
1977]), was not altered (Figure 7—figure supplement 1A). Collectively, these data suggest that
loss of mitochondrial CoQ decreases succinate-driven complex II capacity, but this does not limit
overall mitochondrial respiration in cells.
Although mitochondrial superoxide (Hoehn et al., 2009) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
(Anderson et al., 2009; Paglialunga et al., 2015) have been implicated in insulin resistance, the
cause of increased oxidants has yet to be determined. Elevated mitochondrial H2O2 in response to
lower CoQ content is likely caused by increased production of the superoxide anion radical, the pre-
cursor of H2O2. To test this directly, we determined superoxide in specific in vitro models of adipo-
cyte insulin resistance, using LC-MS to quantify the conversion of mito-hydroethidine to the
superoxide-specific product mito-2-hydroxyethidium (Zielonka et al., 2008). Mitochondrial superox-
ide was increased in the CI model (Figure 7E) and in adipocytes where CoQ biosynthesis was inhib-
ited (Figure 7E–7F), implying that increased mitochondrial H2O2 following loss of CoQ was due to
increased superoxide production.
We next used a series of mitochondrial poisons to determine the site of oxidant production. First,
we assessed whether increased H2O2 was produced by the respiratory chain by incubating cells with
chemical uncouplers to depolarise mitochondria (Fisher-Wellman et al., 2013). BAM15 and FCCP
had no effect on PRDX3 dimerisation in control cells but lowered the PRDX3 dimer/monomer status
to control levels in cells treated with NB (Figure 7G, Figure 7—figure supplement 1C), or in cells in
which the expression of Coq7 and Coq9 were reduced using siRNA (Figure 7—figure supplement
1D–E). This established that loss of CoQ increased H2O2 in a coupled respiration-dependent man-
ner. Administration of the complex II inhibitors TTFA (Figure 7—figure supplement 1B) and malo-
nate lowered the PRDX3 dimer/monomer ratio to near control values in cells treated to inhibit CoQ
biosynthesis (Figure 7G, Figure 7—figure supplement 1C–E) and in other models of insulin resis-
tance (Figure 7H, Figure 7—figure supplement 1H–I), suggesting that increased H2O2 in insulin-
resistant adipocytes was dependent on complex II. The majority of superoxide from succinate-driven
respiration via complex II has been reported to result from reverse electron transport from CoQH2
into complex I, which can be inhibited with rotenone (Quinlan et al., 2012). To test whether this
may account for H2O2 generated in response to loss of CoQ we tested whether NB-responsive
PRDX3 dimerisation was inhibited by rotenone. Rotenone had no effect on the PRDX3 redox state in
NB-treated cells, similar to what was observed for antimycin A (a complex III inhibitor) and oligomy-
cin (a complex V inhibitor) (Figure 7—figure supplement 1F). Further, treatment of 3T3-L1 adipo-
cytes with NB did not change the CoQ redox state, just as the CoQ redox state was not altered in
other in vitro models of insulin resistance (Figure 7—figure supplement 1G). Since a more reduced
CoQ pool is required for reverse election transport from CoQH2 to complex I (Murphy, 2009), these
data suggest that reverse electron transport was not involved in the observed increase in

 superoxide/H2O2 resulting from loss of mitochondrial CoQ, and that complex II itself was the likely
origin the oxidants (Quinlan et al., 2012).
To test whether inhibition of oxidant production from complex II using TTFA and malonate could
overcome insulin resistance we assessed insulin-stimulated HA-GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 insu-
lin-resistant adipocytes in the presence or absence of these complex II inhibitors. Treatment of con-
trol 3T3-L1 adipocytes with TTFA did not impair insulin-stimulated HA-GLUT4 translocation
(Figure 7I) or insulin-regulated inhibition of lipolysis (data not shown), suggesting that impaired
complex II activity does not cause adipocyte insulin resistance per se. Both TTFA and malonate
improved insulin-stimulated HA-GLUT4 translocation to the PM in all models of insulin resistance
tested (Figure 7I–7J), albeit not to the same level as observed in control cells. Further, TTFA
improved insulin-stimulated 2DOG uptake in adipose explants isolated from mice fed a HFHSD
(Figure 7K). Taken together, these data suggest that lower mitochondrial CoQ accelerates superox-
ide generation, most likely from complex II, which in turn elevates the mitochondrial H2O2 burden,
promotes PRDX3 dimerisation and drives insulin resistance.
Discussion
Mitochondrial oxidants have been reported to play an important role in the development of insulin
resistance in adipose (Hoehn et al., 2009; Houstis et al., 2006; Paglialunga et al., 2015) and mus-
cle tissue (Anderson et al., 2009; Hoehn et al., 2009). This is thought to occur primarily via
increased production of superoxide or H2O2 in mitochondria (Anderson et al., 2009; Hoehn et al.,
2009; Paglialunga et al., 2015), yet the proximal mechanism that triggers mitochondrial oxidant
production has remained elusive. Here, we provide insights into the sequence of events that lead to
increased oxidant production and insulin resistance. Mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of
adipose tissue from mice fed a HFHSD, insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 adipocytes and adipose tissue from
insulin-resistant humans, revealed down-regulation of the mevalonate/CoQ biosynthesis pathway in
multiple models, and a separate targeted metabolite analysis revealed a common decrease in mito-
chondrial CoQ content in these models as well as in insulin-resistant muscle. Decreased mitochon-
drial CoQ was sufficient to cause insulin resistance via a mechanism requiring mitochondrial
oxidants, while restoration of mitochondrial CoQ restored insulin sensitivity. These data suggest a
novel pathway that may drive insulin resistance across a broad range of models including muscle
and adipose tissue from mice and adipose tissue from obese humans. The pathway involves
decreased expression of mevalonate pathway/CoQ biosynthetic enzymes, lower mitochondrial CoQ
and insulin resistance as a result of oxidant production primarily from complex II.
Based on the current study, many insults implicated in insulin resistance including hyperinsulinae-
mia, inflammation, corticosteroids and caloric excess converge upon loss of mitochondrial CoQ as a
potential cause of insulin resistance. Mechanistically, this could be explained by decreased expres-
sion of CoQ biosynthetic enzymes, and lower CoQ synthesis rates, in a majority of models studied.
Related to this, our finding that mevalonate pathway inhibiting statins lowered CoQ content and
caused insulin resistance in a CoQ-dependent manner may shed new light on the link between statin
therapy in humans and insulin resistance (Cederberg et al., 2015; Preiss et al., 2011; Sattar et al.,

 2010). The lack of concordance between transcript and protein expression within the mevalonate/
CoQ pathway (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) across the different insulin-resistant models sug-
gests that there may be multiple mechanisms by which this pathway is targeted in response to differ-
ent upstream insults and this maybe mediated via either transcriptional or post-translational
regulation. Furthermore, our subcellular analysis of CoQ content and data from the chronic insulin
model indicate that other aspects of CoQ biology that we do not yet understand may be involved in
regulating mitochondrial CoQ abundance in insulin-resistant conditions. These features could include
the regulation of CoQ turnover and/or its trafficking between mitochondria and other parts of the
cell. Together, this supports the notion that various insults act in different ways, all decreasing mito-
chondrial CoQ as a common means of inducing insulin resistance.
Modest loss of CoQ has been reported to increase mitochondrial oxidants in a range of cellular
systems (Cornelius et al., 2013; Duberley et al., 2013; Quinzii et al., 2013; Quinzii et al., 2012;
Rodrı
´guez-Herna
´ndez et al., 2009), although the precise mechanism for this effect remains
unknown. Our data are consistent with loss of mitochondrial CoQ increasing mitochondrial superox-
ide/H2O2 production because we observed increased superoxide in response to reduced CoQ bio-
synthesis using a highly specific mass-spectrometry-based assay for superoxide (Figure 7E–F). Our
data also suggest that this superoxide is, in part, derived from the flavin site of complex II (IIF)
(Quinlan et al., 2012) since the complex II inhibitors TTFA and malonate lowered PRDX3 dimer/
monomer status. Oxidation of succinate via complex II has been reported to generate large amounts
of superoxide via reverse electron transport to complex I. However, rotenone had no effect on
PRDX3 dimerisation in adipocytes treated with NB and we detected no difference in the overall
CoQ redox state, suggesting that under these conditions superoxide/H2O2 does not originate from
complex I via reverse electron transfer. Unlike electron transfer from complex I to CoQ, electron
transfer from flavoproteins in complex II to CoQ is not limited by the energetic constraints estab-
lished by the membrane potential. This means that electrons can be transferred to CoQ whenever
additional substrate is made available to these flavoproteins, provided oxidized CoQ is available to
receive the electrons. In addition, although there is some evidence that complex III is a site of super-
oxide production (Quinlan et al., 2013), the majority of superoxide in the mitochondria is derived
from flavin sites, including complex II (Quinlan et al., 2013; Starkov and Fiskum, 2003;
Tretter et al., 2007). Therefore, we hypothesise that increased superoxide production from the IIF
site is due to increased steady-state concentrations of the flavin radical as a result of impaired elec-
tron transfer to CoQ at the binding site IIQ, due to decreased CoQ. This interpretation is supported
by our finding that maximal complex II activity was impaired in all models studied. Alternatively,
lower CoQ may favour reverse electron transfer to complex II, and superoxide production from IIF,
under conditions where other enzymes (e.g. mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
[Orr et al., 2012]) are feeding electrons into the CoQ pool (Quinlan et al., 2012). However, there
are likely additional sites of superoxide production since inhibition of complex II only partially res-
cued PRDX3 dimerisation. Despite knowledge of increased oxidants in insulin-resistant humans
(Boden et al., 2015) and that scavenging mitochondrial oxidants benefits insulin sensitivity
(Anderson et al., 2009; Hoehn et al., 2009), the mechanism for increased oxidants in mitochondria
in insulin resistance has remained unclear. Our data address this question and place loss of mito-
chondrial CoQ as a common defect and cause of mitochondrial oxidants, via complex II-derived
superoxide, and insulin resistance in adipocytes and perhaps muscle.
An important question is how increased mitochondrial oxidants impair insulin action. Our data
from cells supplemented with CoQ revealed that improvements in insulin-stimulated glucose trans-
port and inhibition of lipolysis were not associated with improved insulin signalling to Akt or its
downstream substrate TBC1D4. This is consistent with previous reports that defects in insulin-stimu-
lated glucose transport in insulin resistance are not due to obvious defects in proximal insulin signal-
ling (Hoehn et al., 2008; Tan et al., 2015). Although retrograde signalling from the mitochondria to
the nucleus is well described it seems unlikely that this mitochondrial oxidant-induced insulin resis-
tance requires changes in transcription because induction of mitochondrial oxidants acutely impairs
insulin action (Hoehn et al., 2009). Thus, it is more likely that there is a presently undiscovered signal
transduction pathway that communicates directly to mediators of insulin action in the cytoplasm.
Future studies exploring specific targets involved in this pathway and their connection with mito-
chondria and oxidants are warranted.

 Coenzyme Q has received considerable attention as a supplement to ameliorate a range of medi-
cal conditions, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease, based on the observation that serum
and tissue CoQ10 concentrations are decreased in individuals with these conditions. While there are
reports of CoQ supplementation benefitting these conditions (Amin et al., 2014; Ayer et al., 2015;
Hodgson et al., 2002; Mortensen et al., 2014; Raygan et al., 2016), the efficacy of CoQ10 in the
treatment
of
diabetes
and
cardiovascular
diseases
remains
unclear
(Ayer
et
al.,
2015;
Eriksson et al., 1999; Suksomboon et al., 2015). Our study provides a reasonable rationale for tar-
geting the CoQ biosynthesis pathway as a potential therapeutic target. Overall low bioavailability of
orally administered CoQ10 or CoQ10H2 represents a substantial limitation, particularly in situations of
modest CoQ deficiency such as those shown here to be sufficient to initiate insulin resistance, and
where mitochondrial CoQ homeostasis needs to be restored in metabolic tissues such as adipose
and muscle (Zhang et al., 1995). We overcame this limitation in mice by intra-peritoneal administra-
tion of CoQ to provide proof-of-principle that restoration of mitochondrial CoQ improves insulin
action and whole body glucose tolerance (Figure 4). Unfortunately, intra-peritoneal administration
of CoQ10 is not likely a practical strategy for the treatment of insulin resistance in humans. Pharma-

e.g.,
by
polyisoprenoid
epoxides
(Bentinger et al., 2008), or targeting additional processes that contribute to the regulation of mito-
chondrial CoQ content may represent potential options in the future. In the present study, we found
that the protein levels, but not the corresponding levels of the mRNAs, of the CoQ biosynthetic
enzymes COQ7 and COQ9 were decreased in insulin resistance. These proteins form a dimeric com-
plex (Lohman et al., 2014) the formation of which may be regulated via a post-translational mecha-
nism. Although little is known about the molecular regulation of COQ protein turnover, the CoQ
biosynthetic protein complex has been reported to be stabilised by the atypical kinase ADCK3/
COQ8 (He et al., 2014; Stefely et al., 2016)), mitochondrial proteases (Veling et al., 2017) and
CoQ itself (He et al., 2014). Destabilisation of the complex lowers expression of many of the COQ
proteins altered in insulin-resistant adipose tissue, including COQ3, 7 and 9. Therefore, it may be
that loss of COQ7 and 9 in insulin resistance is a result of increased turnover due to complex instabil-
ity. Another therapeutic option is based on our data implicating complex II as the site of increased
oxidant production in response to loss of mitochondrial CoQ. Recent chemical screens have success-
fully identified compounds that prevent superoxide production from complex I (Brand et al., 2016)
and III (Orr et al., 2015), without impairing electron transport. Identifying similar compounds for
complex II may be useful in mitigating superoxide/H2O2 production and overcoming insulin
resistance.

Animal details
Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were purchased from the Animal Resources Centre (Perth, Aus-
tralia) or Australian BioResources (Moss Vale, Australia). The animals were kept in a temperature-
controlled environment (22 ± 1˚C) on a 12 hr light/dark cycle with free access to food and water.
Mice were fed ad libitum for a period of 14 days with a standard lab diet (CHOW) (13% calories
from fat, 22% calories from protein, and 65% calories from carbohydrate, 3.1 kcal/g; Gordon’s Spe-
cialty Stock Feeds, Yanderra, Australia) or with high fat high sucrose diet (HFHSD; 47% of calories
from fat (40% calories from lard), 21% calories from protein, and 32% calories from carbohy-
drates (16% calories from starch), 4.7 kcal/g). All experiments were carried out with the approval of
the Garvan Institute/St. Vincent’s Hospital Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee (09/46) or the
approval of the University of Sydney Animal Ethics Committee (2014/694), following guidelines
issued by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia. All studies used at least
five mice per treatment group. Mice from different cages were used to negate cage-specific effects.
2DOG uptake assays in adipose tissue explants
Epididymal fat depots were excised from mice, transferred immediately to warm DMEM/2% BSA/20
mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and minced into fine pieces. Explants were washed twice and incubated in

 DMEM/2% BSA/20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 for 2 hr. Explants were then rinsed and incubated in Krebs–
Ringer phosphate buffer containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Bovostar, Bovogen) (KRP buffer;
0.6 mM Na2HPO4, 0.4 mM NaH2PO4, 120 mM NaCl, 6 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4 and
12.5 mM Hepes (pH 7.4)). Insulin was added for 20 min, and glucose transport was initiated by addi-
tion of 2-DOG (0.25 mCi, 50 mM) and [14C]mannitol (Source, 0.036 mCi/sample) for the final 5 min of
the assay to measure steady-state rates of 2DOG uptake. For experiments using TTFA (Figure 7K),
100 mM TTFA or equivalent volume of vehicle (EtOH) was included during the 2 hr incubation period
in DMEM/2% BSA and maintained throughout subsequent washes and incubation. Also, the 2DOG
uptake assay was carried out in DMEM without glucose/2% BSA rather than KRP/2% BSA. Uptake
was terminated with three rapid washes in ice-cold PBS, after which the cells were solubilised in
radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (RIPA; 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton
X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol) supplemented with
protease inhibitors (Roche). Samples were assessed for radioactivity by scintillation counting and the
results were normalised for protein content determined by the bicichoninic acid assay. Cages were
randomly assigned to diets and investigators were not blinded to experimental groups.
In vivo metabolic assays
Glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) and insulin tolerance tests (ITTs) were performed on mice following a
6 hr fast from 0700 to 1300. For GTTs, mice were injected i.p. with 10% glucose solution at 1 g/kg
(Figure 1) or 2 mg/kg (Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1) per lean mass. For tracer
uptake during the GTT, mice were also administered [3H]- 2DOG tracer (200 mCi/kg lean weight)
within the 10% glucose solution. For ITTs, mice were i.p. injected with 80 mg/kg pentobarbitone
sodium (Lethabarb Euthanasia Injection, Virbac, Australia), after 20 min the abdominal cavity was
incised along the midline to reveal the liver to inject 1 U/kg lean weight of insulin and [3H]- 2-DOG
(200 mCi/kg lean weight) into the hepatic portal vein. At the times indicated, blood was sampled
from the tail tip and blood glucose determined with an Accu-Chek II glucometer (Roche). Clearance
of the [3H]- 2DOG tracer from the blood during the GTT and ITT was assessed to allow calculation of
tracer disappearance. [3H]- 2DOG tracer uptake into epididymal and inguinal adipose tissue and
quadriceps muscle and conversion to glucose-6-phospate was determined as previously described
(Smith et al., 2007). Plasma NEFAs were measured using NEFA C (Wako, Osaka, Japan) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cages were randomly assigned to diets and investigators were
not blinded to experimental groups.
Assessment of blood insulin during GTT
Blood samples were obtained via tail bleeds using 5 mL heparinised hematocrit tubes (Drummond)
and ejected into a mouse ultra-sensitive insulin ELISA (90080, Crystal Chem). ELISA performed as
per manufacturer’s instructions.
3T3-L1 fibroblast culture and differentiation into adipocytes
Mycoplasma-free 3T3-L1 fibroblasts obtained from 3T3-L1 Howard Green (Harvard Medical School,
Boston, MA) were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1% GlutaMAX (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) in a humidified atmosphere with 10% CO2. HA-GLUT4 overexpressing 3T3-L1 fibro-
blasts were generated by retroviral transduction as previously described (Govers et al., 2004). Con-
fluent 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated into adipocytes by the addition of DMEM containing 0.22 mM
dexamethasone, 100 ng/mL biotin, 2 mg/mL insulin, 500 mM IBMX (day 0). After 72 hr, medium was
replaced with DMEM/10% FCS/GlutaMAX containing 2 mg/mL insulin (day three post differentia-
tion). After a further 72 hr (day six post differentiation), cells were cultured in DMEM/10% FCS/Glu-
taMAX. Medium was subsequently replaced every 48 hr. Cells were used between days 10 and 15
after the initiation of differentiation.
For stable isotope labelling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based proteomics, 3T3-L1 fibro-
blasts were passaged for six cell divisions in DMEM (Sigma Alrich)/10% dialysed FCS (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) containing L-arginine (Arg 0) and L-lysine (Lys 0) (‘light’), L-arginine-U-13C6
14N4 (Arg 6) and
L-lysine-2H4 (Lys 4) (‘medium’) or L-arginine-U-13C6
15N4 (Arg 10) and L-lysine-U-13C6
15N2 (Lys 8)
(‘heavy’). Final concentrations of arginine and lysine were 33 mg/mL and 76 mg/mL, respectively. This

 strategy generated three distinct SILAC populations. We periodically tested labelling efficiency by
mass spectrometry analysis. SILAC-labelled fibroblasts were differentiated into adipocytes as above.
In vitro models of insulin resistance and CoQ treatment
Insulin resistance was induced by dexamethasone, tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF), or hyperinsulinae-
mia as previously described (Hoehn et al., 2008). The chronic insulin (CI) model of hyperinsulinemia
was created by addition of 10 nM insulin to adipocytes at 1200, 1600 and 2000 hr on day 1 and
0800 hr the following day. Glucocorticoid-induced insulin resistance was recreated with 20 nM dexa-
methasone (Dex) (0.01% ethanol carrier as control), starting on day seven post initiation of differenti-
ation and media was changed every other day for 8 d. Chronic low-dose inflammation was mimicked
in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by incubation with 2 ng/mL TNFa (Calbiochem) for 4 d. Medium was changed
every 24 hr. For CoQ treatment, cells were incubated with 10 mM CoQ9 (Sigma Aldrich) or 10 mM
liposomal CoQ10 (LiQsorb, Tichson Corp.) for 24 hr prior to assays. CoQ9 was dissolved in ethanol at
5 mM and diluted to 10 mM in pre-warmed DMEM/10% FCS, 1% GlutaMAX and incubated at 37˚C
for 30 min prior to addition to cells. Ethanol was used as a vehicle control (0.2%).
2-Deoxyglucose uptake assays in cultured cells
Following 2 hr serum-starvation in DMEM/0.2% BSA/1% GlutaMAX, cells were washed and incu-
bated in pre-warmed Krebs–Ringer phosphate buffer containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA,
Bovostar, Bovogen) (KRP buffer; 0.6 mM Na2HPO4, 0.4 mM NaH2PO4, 120 mM NaCl, 6 mM KCl, 1
mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4 and 12.5 mM Hepes (pH 7.4)). Cells were stimulated with 100 nM insulin
for 20 min. To determine non-specific glucose uptake, 25 mM cytochalasin B (ethanol, Sigma Aldrich)
was added to the wells before addition of 2-[3H]deoxyglucose (2-DOG) (PerkinElmer). During the
final 5 min 2-DOG (0.25 mCi, 50 mM) was added to cells to measure steady-state rates of 2DOG
uptake. Following three washes with ice-cold PBS, cells were solubilised in PBS containing 1% (v/v)
Triton X-100. Tracer uptake was quantified by liquid scintillation counting and data normalised for
protein content. Data were further normalised to maximal insulin stimulation of control cells, set to
100%.
HA-GLUT4 assay

HA-GLUT4
was
performed
as
previously
described
(Govers et al., 2004). Briefly, cells were serum-starved for 2 hr in DMEM/0.2% BSA/GlutaMAX. Cells
were stimulated with 100 nM insulin for 20 min as indicated. Cells were fixed but not permeabilised,
and the amount of HA-GLUT4 present at the plasma membrane determined by the accessibility of
the HA epitope to anti-HA antibody (Covance, clone 16B12). Cells were incubated with 20 mg/mL
goat anti-mouse Alexa-488-conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Determination
of total HA-GLUT4 was performed in a separate set of cells that underwent the same labelling pro-
cedure except that anti-HA staining was performed after permeabilisation of the cells with 0.1% (w/
v) saponin. Total HA-GLUT4 was measured separately for each experimental treatment group. Fluo-
rescence (excitation 485 nm/emission 520 nm) was measured using a fluorescent microtiter plate
reader (FLUOstar Galaxy, BMG LABTECH). Surface HA-GLUT4 was expressed as a percentage of
total HA-GLUT4.
Lipolysis assay
Following 2 hr serum-starvation in DMEM/0.2% BSA/1% GlutaMAX, cells were washed and incu-
bated in DMEM containing 3.5% fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma-Aldrich), GlutaMAX and 10 mM glucose.
Cells were treated with or without 1 nM isoproterenol and/or indicated doses of insulin for 1 hr. Ali-
quots of medium were taken to assay for glycerol content using Sigma glycerol reagent (Sigma-
Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Following three washes with ice-cold PBS, cells
were solubilised in PBS containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Glycerol release as a measure for lipolysis
was normalized to cellular protein content. Complete datasets are presented in Figure 4—figure
supplement 1 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1. Insulin-stimulated inhibition of lipolysis
(Figures 4C, 5C and F) was calculated as glycerol release from cells treated with 0.5 nM insulin and
1 nM isoproterenol as a percentage of the glycerol release from cells treated with 1 nM isoprotere-
nol alone.

 Human cohort and protocol
Adipose mitochondrial CoQ content was assessed in a cohort of females studied using 2-stage
hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps with deuterated glucose tracers and adipose biopsies, as pre-
viously described (Chen et al., 2015). Briefly, the study protocol was approved by St Vincent’s Hos-
pital Human Research Ethics Committee (Sydney, Australia) (HREC/10/SVH/133) and written consent
obtained prior to the study. Volunteers were sedentary individuals with obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2) and
exclusion criteria were diabetes, treatment with medications known to affect glucose homeostasis,
>20 g/d alcohol intake, body weight instability in previous 3 months and known cancer, cardiac,
renal or liver disease. All studies were performed at the Clinical Research Facility at the Garvan Insti-
tute of Medical Research (Sydney, Australia). The clamp started with a 2 hr primed (5 mg/kg), contin-
uous (3 mg/kg/h) infusion of [6,6-2H2]glucose, followed by a 2 hr infusion of low-dose insulin (15 mU/
m2/min) and a 2 hr infusion of high-dose insulin (80 mU/m2/min). The deuterated glucose infusion
rate was halved (1.5 mg/kg/h) during, and ceased at the end of, the low-dose insulin infusion. Glu-
cose was infused to maintain whole-blood concentration of 5 mmol/L with variable rate infusion of
dextrose (25%, enriched to 2.5% with deuterated glucose). Endogenous glucose production and
non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) suppression during the low- dose insulin clamp reflect hepatic and
adipose insulin resistance, while glucose infusion rate during the last 30 min of the high-dose insulin
clamp normalised to body fat free mass estimates muscle insulin resistance (Chen et al., 2015). Peri-
umbilical subcutaneous fat biopsy was performed during the basal clamp stage under sterile condi-
tions using a trocar, as described (Chen et al., 2015). Adipose tissue (50 mg) was fixed, dehydrated,
paraffin embedded and sectioned and adipocyte cell size measured as previously described
(Chen et al., 2015) or snap frozen and stored in �80˚C for processing and analysis of CoQ content.
Body composition was evaluated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and abdominal fat distribu-
tion and liver fat by magnetic resonance imaging as previously described (Chen et al., 2015). To
separate subjects into groups (e.g. high vs low mitochondrial CoQ10 concentrations as in Table 1, or
insulin sensitive vs insulin resistant in Figure 3E and Figure 3—figure supplement 1K), subjects
were divided into an upper tertile (typically 11 subjects) or lower two tertiles (typically 22 subjects)
based on specified parameters (e.g. mitochondrial CoQ10 concentration (Table 1), suppression of
NEFAs (Figure 3E), glucose infusion rates [Figure 3—figure supplement 1K]).
Sample preparation for mass spectrometry (mouse adipose tissue)
Epididymal adipose tissue was excised from mice fed a HFHSD for the specified durations (five mice
per time point). Tissue was lysed in 6 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 25 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate,
pH 7.9 containing phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche) by tip-probe sonication (2 �
30 s) on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 17,000 x g, 15 min, 4˚C. The fat cake was removed and the
supernate precipitated with 6 volumes of acetone, overnight at �20˚C. Pelleted protein was re-sus-
pended in 6 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 25 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.9 and quantified by
Qubit fluorescence (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 100 mg of protein was subjected to reduction with 10
mM DTT for 60 min at 25˚C and alkylated with 25 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at 25˚C in the dark.
Excess iodoacetamide was then removed by reaction 20 mM DTT and the sample digested with
Lys-C (Wako) at 1:50 (w/w?) enzyme to substrate ratio for 2 hr at 25˚C. The mixture was diluted 5-
fold with 25 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate and digested further with trypsin at 1:50 enzyme to
substrate ratio for 12 hr at 30˚C. The peptide mixture was acidified to a final concentration of 2% for-
mic acid, 0.1% trifuoroacetic acid and centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 15 min. Peptides were desalted
using hydrophilic lipophilic balance – solid phase extraction (HLB-SPE) cartridges (Waters) followed
by elution with 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifuoroacetic acid and dried by vacuum centrifugation.
Sample preparation for mass spectrometry (3T3-L1 adipocytes)
SILAC 3T3-L1 adipocytes were left untreated (insulin sensitive) or treated to induce insulin resistance
(insulin resistant) as described above. Four biological replicates were used for all SILAC experiments.
SILAC mixes were made so that a SILAC doublet contained a constant untreated sample acting as a
reference for each insulin-resistant model. A label switch was performed in biological replicates to
ensure that identified changes in protein expression were due to experimental manipulation. For
example, the light versus heavy doublet was analysed twice; we compared protein content in both

 insulin sensitive (light) versus insulin resistant (heavy) and insulin sensitive (heavy) versus insulin resis-
tant (light).
Cells were serum-starved for 2 hr, washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed in RIPA con-
taining protease inhibitors. After 15 min on ice, the protein concentration was determined by the
BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Insulin-resistant samples were mixed in a 1:1 ratio based on
total protein concentration with an insulin sensitive control to form a SILAC doublet. Per SILAC dou-
blet, two samples were prepared as follows: mixed lysates were centrifuged at 18,000 x g for 15 min
at 4˚C to pellet insoluble material, and the resulting supernate (RIPA-soluble fraction) collected. The
pellet was re-dissolved in RIPA buffer containing 4% SDS, sonicated (Bandelin SONOPLUS) (1 s �
12), and centrifuged at 18,000 x g for 15 min, and the resulting supernate (RIPA-insoluble fraction)
collected. The pH of the RIPA-soluble and –insoluble fraction was adjusted to ~8 by the addition of
50 mM Tris, pH 8.8. Protein thiols were reduced by incubating samples with 1 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT) at 95˚C for 3 min, followed by incubation for 25 min at room temperature and alkylation with
5.5 mM iodoacetamide in the dark at room temperature for 20 min. Proteins were precipitated in 5
volumes of acetone at �20˚C overnight. Precipitated proteins were pelleted at 15,000 x g, allowed
to air dry before being re-suspended in 4% SDS, 50 mM Tris, pH 6.8. The protein concentration of
each sample was then determined by the BCA assay.
RIPA-soluble and RIPA-insoluble samples for each SILAC doublet were prepared for SDS-PAGE
by diluting in sample buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–
20% gradient gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Gels were stained with SYPRO Ruby Protein Gel Stain
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Lanes containing RIPA-soluble
samples were cut into 11 slices, and lanes containing RIPA-insoluble samples were divided into eight
slices. Each slice contained approximately the same level of SYPRO Ruby signal and was cut into 1
mm x 1 mm squares to assist protein extraction. Gel pieces were de-stained in 250 mM ammonium
bicarbonate pH 8, 50% acetonitrile under constant agitation for 30 min. Destain solution was
removed and gel pieces dried in 100% acetonitrile. After 10 min, acetonitrile was removed and pro-
teins were digested by the addition of modified trypsin (Promega, 12.5 ng/mL) in 100 mM NH4HCO3.
Digestion was carried out overnight at 37˚C. The digestion was stopped by the addition of 5% for-
mic acid and peptides eluted with acetonitrile. Finally, peptide solutions were dried, re-suspended in
1% trifluoroacetic acid and desalted on C18 Stagetips (3M, Empore).
Sample preparation for mass spectrometry (human adipose tissue)
Adipose tissue homogenates were diluted 1:1 in 6 M guanidine in 100 mM Tris pH 7.5 containing 10
mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and 40 mM chloroacetamide, and heated at 95˚C for 5 min. The
lysate was tip-probe sonicated and centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 30 min at 4˚C. The supernatant was
precipitated with 6 volumes of acetone, overnight at �20˚C. Pelleted protein were re-suspended in
10% trifluoroethanol in 100 mM Tris, pH 7.5 and quantified by BCA. Seven mg of protein was
digested with 140 ng sequencing grade Lys-C (Wako) for 2 hr at 25˚C followed by 140 ng of
sequencing grade trypsin (Sigma Aldrich) overnight at 37˚C. The digest was acidified to a final con-
centration of 1% trifluroacetic acid (TFA), and peptides purified using SDB-RPS solid-phase disks
(Sigma Aldrich) and eluted with 1% ammonium hydroxide in 80% acetonitrile. Peptides were dried
by vacuum centrifugation and resuspended in 0.1% TFA in 2% acetonitrile.
Quantitative mass spectrometric analysis
For mouse adipose tissue experiments, peptides were loaded onto a 50 cm column with 75 mm inner
diameter, packed in-house with 1.9 mM C18 ReproSil particles (Dr Maisch GmbH). Reversed-phase
chromatography was performed on an Easy nLC1000 HPLC using a binary buffer system of 0.5% ace-
tic acid (buffer A) and 80% acetonitrile/0.5% acetic acid (buffer B). Peptides were separated by linear
gradients of buffer B from 5% to 35% over 240 min, at a flow rate of 250 nL/min and electrosprayed
into the mass spectrometer by the application of 2.3 kV using a liquid junction connection. Ionised
peptides were analysed on Q-Exactive (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The Q-Exactive was operated in
data-dependent acquisition mode, acquiring survey scans of 3 million ions at a resolution of 70,000
at 200 m/z. Twenty of the most abundant isotope patterns from each of the survey scans with charge
state �2 were selected with an isolation window of 2 Th, and fragmented in the HCD cell with NCE
of 25. Maximum ion fill times for the MS/MS scans were 120 ms, target fill value was 1e5 ions with an

 under fill ratio of 20%. Fragmented ions were analysed with high resolution (35,000 at 400 m/z) in
the Orbitrap analyser. Dynamic exclusion was enabled with a duration of 60 s.
For SILAC cell culture experiments, peptides were loaded onto a 20 cm column with 75 mm inner
diameter, packed in-house with 3 mM C18 ReproSil particles (Dr Maisch GmbH). Reversed-phase
chromatography was performed on either the Dionex Ultimate 3000 or the Easy nLC II HPLC using a
binary buffer system of 0.5% acetic acid (buffer A) and 80% acetonitrile/0.5% acetic acid (buffer B).
Peptides were separated by linear gradient of buffer B from 5% to 35% over 240 min, at a flow rate
of 250 nL/min and electrosprayed into the mass spectrometer by the application of 1.9–2.3 kV using
a liquid junction connection. Ionised peptides were analysed on an Orbitrap Velos (Thermo Fisher
Scientific).
The Orbitrap Velos was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode, acquiring survey scans of
1 million ions at a resolution of 30,000 at 400 m/z. Three survey-scan ranges (350–1050 m/z, 850–
1750 m/z and 350–1750 m/z) were utilised to enhance dynamic range. Five (for the first two mass
windows) or seven (for the last mass window) of the most abundant isotope patterns from each of
the survey scans with charge state �2 were selected with an isolation window of 2 Th, and frag-
mented in the HCD cell with NCE of 40. Maximum ion fill times for the MS/MS scans were 150 ms,
target fill value was 4e4 ions, and ion selection thresholds were 1e4. Fragmented ions were analysed
with high resolution (7500 resolution at 400 m/z) in the Orbitrap analyser. Dynamic exclusion was
enabled with a duration of 60 s and a mass window of ±7 ppm. Lock-mass was enabled using
445.120025. On the Q-Exactive, survey scans (300–1600 m/z) were acquired at a resolution of
70,000 and up to 15 of the most intense isotope patterns were selected for fragmentation in the
HCD cell with NCE 25. Ion fill targets for MS/MS were 1E5 ions and fragmented ions were with high
resolution (17,500) in the Orbitrap analyser.
For human adipose tissue experiments, peptides were loaded onto a 50 cm column with 75 mm
inner diameter, packed in-house with 1.9 mM C18 ReproSil particles (Dr Maisch GmbH). Reversed-
phase chromatography was performed on an Easy nLC1200 HPLC using a binary buffer system of
0.1% formic acid (buffer A) and 80% acetonitrile/0.5% acetic acid (buffer B). Peptides were sepa-
rated by linear gradients of buffer B from 2% to 35% over 180 min, at a flow rate of 300 nL/min and
electrosprayed into the mass spectrometer by the application of 2.4 kV using a liquid junction con-
nection. Ionised peptides were analysed on Q-Exactive HF (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated in
data-dependent acquisition mode, acquiring survey scans of 3 million ions at a resolution of 60,000
at 200 m/z. Fifteen of the most abundant isotope patterns from each of the survey scans with charge
state �2 were selected with an isolation window of 1.4 Th, and fragmented in the HCD cell with
NCE of 27. Maximum ion fill times for the MS/MS scans were 125 ms, target fill value was 2e5 ions
with a target threshold set to 1e5 Fragmented ions were analysed with high resolution (15,000 at
200 m/z) in the Orbitrap analyser. Dynamic exclusion was enabled with a duration of 60 s.
Mass spectrometry data processing
For mouse adipose tissue experiments, raw mass spectrometry data were processed using the Max-
Quant software (Cox and Mann, 2008; Cox et al., 2009) version 1.4.0.8 using the default settings
with minor changes: Oxidised Methionine (M) and Acetylation (Protein N-term) were selected as vari-
able modifications, and carbamidomethyl (C) as fixed modification. A maximum of two missed clea-
vages was permitted, 10 peaks per 100 Da, MS/MS tolerance of 20 ppm, and a minimum peptide
length of 6. The ‘matching between runs’ algorithm was enabled with a time window of 2 min to
transfer identifications between adjacent samples. Database searching was performed using the
Andromeda search engine (Cox et al., 2011) integrated into the MaxQuant environment against the
mouse Uniprot proteome database, concatenated with known contaminants and reversed sequences
of all entries. Protein, peptide and site FDR was controlled at a maximum of 1% respectively. All con-
taminants and reverse sequenced peptides were removed and the data were log2 transformed. Pro-
teins with 60% or more missing values within each experimental group were removed. Missing
expression data within each group was imputed using nearest neighbour averaging or K-nearest
neighbours (k = 5) from R package impute (Trevor Hastie et al., 2018).
For SILAC cell culture experiments, raw mass spectrometry data were processed using the Max-
Quant software (Cox and Mann, 2008; Cox et al., 2009) version 1.3.0.5 using the default settings
with minor changes: oxidised methionine (M) and acetylation (Protein N-term) were selected as vari-
able modifications, and carbamidomethyl (C) as fixed modification, as well as double SILAC labels

 (either Arg 0/Lys 0 and Arg 10/Lys 8 or Arg 6/Lys 4 and Arg 10/Lys 8). A maximum of two missed
cleavages was permitted, 10 peaks per 100 Da, MS/MS tolerance of 20 ppm, and a minimum pep-
tide length of 6. The ‘matching between runs’ algorithm was enabled with a time window of 2 min
to transfer identifications between adjacent gel slices, only for samples analysed using the same
nanospray conditions. Database searching was performed using the Andromeda search engine inte-

database,
concatenated with known contaminants and reversed sequences of all entries. Protein, peptide and
site FDR was controlled at a maximum of 1% respectively. All contaminants and reverse sequenced
peptides were removed, and the data were log2 transformed. This lead to the identification of 5908
protein groups, of which 2620 correspond to unique proteins and 3288 contained in multiple pro-
teins. We subsequently applied Re-Fraction (Yang et al., 2012) on protein groups that contained
multiple proteins and resolved a further 960 unique protein identifications. For groups that could
not be identified as a single protein, proteins with the lowest posterior error probability were
selected.
For human adipose tissue experiments, raw mass spectrometry data were processed using the
MaxQuant software (Cox and Mann, 2008; Cox et al., 2009) version 1.5.7.0 using the default set-
tings with minor changes: Oxidised Methionine (M) and Acetylation (Protein N-term) were selected
as variable modifications, and carbamidomethyl (C) as fixed modification. A maximum of two missed
cleavages was permitted, 10 peaks per 100 Da, MS/MS tolerance of 20 ppm, and a minimum pep-
tide length of 6. The ‘matching between runs’ algorithm was enabled with a time window of 2 min
to transfer identifications between adjacent samples. Database searching was performed using the
Andromeda search engine (Cox et al., 2011) integrated into the MaxQuant environment against the
human Uniprot proteome database, concatenated with known contaminants and reversed sequen-
ces of all entries. Protein, peptide and site FDR was controlled at a maximum of 1% respectively. All
contaminants and reverse sequenced peptides were removed, and the data were log2 transformed.
To normalise the protein quantifications across different samples, proteins were first ranked within
each sample based on their MS intensities and then ranked across all samples to identify the most
stable proteins for data normalisation. Using this approach, 40S ribosomal protein (RPSA) was
selected for normalisation by calculating a log fold change of protein intensities with respect to
RPSA within each sample, allowing relative protein abundance (refer to as normalised ratio) to be
comparable across all samples for all proteins.
Microarray analysis
RNA was prepared using the RNeasy protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Quantity and quality of total
RNA samples were determined using an ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and
Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA), respectively. RNA with RNA integrity num-
bers > 8, 260/280 values > 1.8 and 260/230 values > 1.8 was considered acceptable. Labelled cRNA
was hybridised to Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays. Initial data analysis files were generated using
manufacturer’s GeneChip Command Console Software. Relative mRNA contents were studied for
45,000 transcripts for cells and tissue.
Microarray data processing
All statistical data analysis for the gene expression data were performed in the R-programming envi-
ronment. AT transcripts in the mouse4302 Affymetrix array was pre-processed using R package
affyPLM (Bm, 2004; Bolstad BM et al., 2005). Background correction, quantile normalisation and
summarisation was performed using RMA function (Irizarry et al., 2003). Quality control assess-
ments of the arrays were performed and problematic arrays were identified and down-weighted for
ensuing statistical inference tests using function arrayWeights (Ritchie et al., 2006) within LIMMA
(Ritchie et al., 2015) during linear model fitting of the microarray data. Probes were collapsed to
gene level using the maximal average expression of probes across all samples.
Data availability
The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium
via the PRIDE (Vizcaı
´no et al., 2016) partner repository with the dataset identifiers PXD005128 and
PXD006891. The microarray discussed in this manuscript have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene

Differential transcript and protein analysis
Differential expression analysis of proteins and transcripts within each model of insulin resistance
were performed using moderated t-test from LIMMA package (Goeman and Bu
¨hlmann, 2007;
Michaud et al., 2008; Wu and Smyth, 2012). For the cell models and adipose tissue, proteins and
transcripts with an absolute fold change (FC) >1.5 and controlled for 5% FDR were considered differ-
entially expressed. Empirical Bayes was used for global variance shrinkage and Benjamini and Hoch-
berg method (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) was used to correct multiple hypothesis testing. The
moderated t-statistics from differential expression analysis in each model was transformed to
z-scores and used as the test statistics for the direction analysis (Yang et al., 2014) to identify
genes/proteins altered (up/down) across multiple experimental conditions. For the cell models, we
performed a 3-dimensional direction analysis (across CI, Dex and TNF) whereas in AT, we performed
a 2-dimensional direction analysis (across 5 and 14 d of HFHSD). Significance for transcripts was
defined as p-value<0.001 and for proteins at 0.01.
Pathway enrichment analysis
Pathway enrichment for each condition in cell models and adipose tissue were analysed using by
testing up- and down-regulation of 192 pathways from the KEGG database (Kanehisa and Goto,
2000) as curated by the Molecular Signature Database C2: curated gene sets (Liberzon et al.,
2011; Subramanian et al., 2005) using the mean-rank gene-set enrichment test implemented in
LIMMA R package (Goeman and Bu
¨hlmann, 2007; Michaud et al., 2008; Wu and Smyth, 2012) in
our transcript and protein data. The fold change (log2 scale) of genes and proteins from the individ-
ual DE analysis in each model was used as the test-statistics for the GSEA analysis. Significance of
pathways was defined at p-value<0.05. CoQ pathway members were edited from the original KEGG
annotation to include recent annotations and consisted of Hpd, Tat, Coq2/3/4/5/6/7/9, Adck3, and
Adck4.
Pathway integrative analysis and phenotype association
For human proteome data, we associated the normalised ratio of each protein with phenotypical
information across all samples using pairwise Pearson’s correlation. To perform a similar analysis on
pathway level, for each protein, we calculated a relative protein ratio in each sample by subtracting
the average of normalised ratios across all samples. Subsequently, for each KEGG pathway, we sum-
marised its overall trend within each sample by summing the relative ratios of all proteins belong to
that pathway. The summary statistics for each pathway in each sample was then used to associate
with phenotypical information using pairwise Pearson’s correlation. These results were subsequently
visualised as heatmaps.
To identify pathways enriched across multiple tissue and/or cell models, we used Fisher’s com-
bined statistics to integrate p-values from individual pathway enrichment analysis conducted on each
condition in cell models and adipose tissue. Fisher’s combined statistics follows a chi-square distribu-
tion and the integrated p-values from the chi-square distribution are converted into z-scores
(referred to as combined z-scores) for cell model and adipose tissue, respectively, to visualise each
pathway and their overall enrichment across multiple conditions in cell models and tissue.
Determination of cholesterol and CoQ
CoQ9 and CoQ10 content in 3T3-L1 adipocyte lysates, tissue homogenates, and membrane fractions
from cells, and tissue were determined as described previously (Gay and Stocker, 2004). Investiga-
tors were blinded to experimental groups. Briefly, samples were thawed, mixed gently and 50–450
mL placed in a 15 mL screw top tube to which 2 mL methanol and 10 mL of water-washed hexane
were added. The mixture was then mixed vigorously for 1 min, centrifuged (1430 x g, 5 min, 4˚C)
and 9 mL of the top hexane layer collected then dried using a rotary evaporator. The resulting dried
lipids were re-dissolved in 180 mL ice-cold mobile phase (ethanol:methanol:isopropanol: ammonium
acetate pH 4.4, 65:30:3:2, vol/vol/vol/vol) and transferred into HPLC vials. Cholesterol, CoQ9,
CoQ9H2, CoQ10 and CoQ10H2 were determined by HPLC using a Supelcosil LC-C18 column (5 mm,

 250 � 4.6 mm) eluted at 1 mL/min and connected to UV and electrochemical (ESA CoulArray
5600A) detectors. NEC was detected at 214 nm, while CoQ9, CoQ9H2, CoQ10 and CoQ10H2 were
detected at �700, +700 and +500 mV and quantified against authentic commercial standards
obtained from Sigma Aldrich (USA). CoQ9H2 and CoQ10H2 standards were generated by sodium
borohydride-mediated reduction of commercial CoQ9 and CoQ10, respectively.
For accurate determination of CoQ9 and CoQ9H2 for calculation of CoQ redox status analyses
were performed as above with several modifications to sample preparation to limit oxidation. Cells
were washed in PBS containing 100 mM diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and homoge-
nised in HES buffer pre-gassed with argon. Homogenisation was carried out under an argon atmo-
sphere. Homogenates were processed one-at-a-time and samples dried in the rotary evaporator
under argon. Samples were analysed immediately.
Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry was used for the determination of CoQ9,
CoQ9H2, CoQ10 and CoQ10H2 in human and mouse adipose tissue after in vivo supplementation
with CoQ10. Briefly, to 50–450 mL of adipose tissue homogenates, internal standard (200 pmol
CoQ8; Avanti Polar Lipids) were added and homogenates extracted with methanol/hexane as
described above. Following evaporation of the hexane phase, the resulting dried lipids were re-dis-
solved in 150 mL ice-cold ethanol (HPLC grade) and 5 mL injected onto an Agilent 1290 UHPLC sys-
tem connected to an Agilent 6490 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. Analytes were separated
on a 2.6 mm Kinetex XB-C18 100 A column (50 � 2.10 mm; Phenomenex, USA) by gradient elution
using mobile phase A (2.5 mM ammonium formate in 95:5 methanol:isopropanol) and mobile phase
B (2.5 mM ammonium formate in 100% isopropanol) at 0.8 mL/min. The gradient consisted of 0%
mobile phase B from 0 to 1.5 min, 0–10% B from 1.5 to 2 min, 10% B from 2 to 3 min and back to
0% B from 3 to 5 min. Flow was then directed into the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with
parameters set as follows: gas temperature = 250˚C; gas flow = 20 L/min; nebuliser pressure = 35
psi; sheath gas heater = 325˚C; sheath gas flow = 12 L/min; capillary voltage = 3,500 V. Detection of
CoQ8, CoQ9, CoQ9H2, CoQ10 and CoQ10H2 was by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in positive
ion mode using the above general mass spectrometry parameters with fragmentor voltage at 380 V
and cell accelerator voltage at 5 V. In each case, the fragment ions generated by collision-induced
dissociation of the [M + H]+ or the [M+NH4]+ ions were used for quantification. MRM settings for the
target analytes were (parent ion fi fragment ion); CoQ8 (m/z 727.1 fi 197.1) with collision energy
(CE) = 33 V; CoQ9 (m/z 795.5 fi 197.1) with CE = 33 V; CoQ9H2-NH4 (m/z 816.6 fi 197.1) with
CE = 25 V; CoQ10 (m/z 863.6 fi 197.1) with CE = 37 V; and CoQ10H2 (m/z 882.7 fi 197.1) with
CE = 33 V. CoQ8, CoQ9 and CoQ10 were quantified against authentic commercial standards
obtained from Sigma Aldrich (USA), while CoQ9H2 and CoQ10H2 standards were generated from
CoQ9 and CoQ10, respectively by sodium borohydride-mediated.
For determination of CoQ9 synthesis rates, cells were incubated with 50 mM 13C6-4-hydroxyben-
zoic acid (Cambridge isotope, USA) in DMEM containing GlutaMAX and dialysed FCS for 12 hr fol-
lowing treatment to induce insulin resistance. Cells were washed with cold PBS and homogenised in
HES-I buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 250 mM sucrose, protease inhibitors) by 12
strokes of a Dounce homogeniser. To 350 mL of cell homogenates, internal standard (200 pmol
CoQ8; Avanti Polar Lipids) was added and homogenates extracted with methanol/hexane as
described above. Following evaporation of the hexane phase, the resulting dried lipids were re-dis-
solved in 150 mL ice-cold ethanol (HPLC grade) and 5 mL injected onto an Agilent 1290 UHPLC sys-
tem connected to an Agilent 6490 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer with column, mobile
phases, gradient elution, flow rate and mass spectrometry parameters as above. MRM settings for
13C6-CoQ9 (parent ion fi fragment ion) were m/z 801.5 fi 203 with collision energy (CE) = 33 V.
13C6-CoQ9 was quantified against authentic CoQ9 commercial standard.
Subcellular fractionation
To measure cholesterol and CoQ9 content is different cellular compartments (Figure 3 and Fig-
ure 3—figure supplement 1), we performed isolated plasma membrane, mitochondrial and micro-
somes by differential centrifugation. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed with ice-cold PBS, harvested in
ice-cold HES-I, and subsequent steps were carried out at 4˚C. Cells were homogenised by 12 strokes
of a Dounce homogeniser to yield a whole cell homogenate prior to centrifugation at 700 � g for 10
min to pellet nuclei and unbroken cells. The resulting supernate was centrifuged at 13,550 � g for
12 min to pellet the plasma membrane (PM) and mitochondria, with the resulting supernate

 consisting of cytosol and microsomes. This supernate was then centrifuged at 235,200 � g for 75
min to obtain a cytosol fraction (supernate) and a microsomal fraction (pellet). The PM/mitochondria
pellet was re-suspended/washed in HES-I and re-centrifuged at 13,550 � g for 12 min. The PM/mito-
chondria pellet was re-suspended again in HES-I and layered over a high sucrose HES buffer (1.12 M
sucrose, 0.05 mM EDTA, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 111,160 � g for 60 min in a
swing-out rotor. The pellet was the mitochondria fraction. The PM fraction was collected above the
sucrose layer, and centrifuged again at 13,550 � g for 12 min to achieve a PM pellet. All fractions
were re-suspended in HES-I. Protein concentration for each fraction was performed using the BCA
assay.
Mitochondrial isolation
For specific assessment of mitochondrial CoQ content in cell culture (Figure 4), and for assessment
of mitochondrial CoQ9 or CoQ10 in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver from mice and adipose
tissue from humans we used a protocol to directly enrich mitochondria (Figure 3, Figure 3—figure
supplement 1). Mitochondrial isolation of cultured adipocytes and tissues from mice and humans
was performed as previously described (Frezza et al., 2007). Briefly, cells/tissue was homogenised
in mitochondrial isolation buffer (10 mM Tris-MOPS, pH 7.4, 1 mM EGTA, 200 mM sucrose contain-
ing protease inhibitors) by 12 strokes of a Dounce homogeniser at 4˚C and samples kept at 4˚C sub-
sequently. Homogenates were centrifuged at 700 x g for 10 min and then the supernate centrifuged
at 7000 x g for 10 min to obtain a pellet containing the mitochondria. The pellet was re-suspended
in mitochondrial isolation buffer and re-centrifuged at 7000 x g for 10 min. The mitochondrial pellet
was finally re-suspended in mitochondrial isolation buffer and protein concentration determined
using the BCA assay.
Citrate synthase assay
Cultured adipocytes or adipose tissue was homogenised in mitochondrial extraction buffer (50 mM
potassium phosphate, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Triton, pH 7.4) by 12 strokes of a Dounce homogeniser.
Homogenates were freeze-thawed three times and insoluble debris pelleted by centrifugation at
5000 x g for 10 min. Citrate synthase activity was assayed by adding diluted samples to citrate syn-
thase assay buffer (100 mM Tris:HCl, pH 8, 100 mM MgCl250 mM EDTA) containing 0.5 mM dithioni-
trobenzoic acid and 80 mM acetyl-CoA and the reaction monitored spectrophotometrically at 37˚C
at 412 nm for background activity. Oxaloacetate was added to 1 mM to start the reaction. Back-
ground activity prior to the addition of oxaloacetate was subtracted to obtain rates specific to citrate
synthase. Citrate synthase activity was calculated as mU/mg using the extinction coefficient dithioni-
trobenzoic acid for (e = 13.6 mmol/mL/cm) and taking sample dilution into account.
Cell lysis
Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in 1% SDS in PBS-containing protease inhibitors. Cell
lysates were sonicated (Bandelin SONOPLUS) for 12 s and centrifuged at 13,000 � g for 15 min at
room temperature. The protein concentration of the resulting supernate was then determined by
the BCA assay.
SDS-PAGE and western blotting
Proteins (5–10 mg) from cell/tissue lysates or homogenates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and trans-
ferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% BSA or skim milk
powder in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 for 1 hr, followed by an overnight
incubation at 4˚C with specific primary antibody solutions. Membranes were incubated with an
appropriate secondary antibody for 1 hr before signals were detected using ECL (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific or Millipore) on the Chemidoc MP (Bio-Rad) or on the Odyssey Fluorescence Detection Sys-
tem (LiCOR). Antibodies detecting multiple mitochondrial complex subunits (Cat. No. 45–8099) and
PRDX1 were from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Cat. No. PA3-750), anti-PRDX2 (Cat. No. ab109367,
clone: EPR5154) and anti-catalase (Cat. No. ab52477) antibodies were from Abcam, anti-PRDX3 anti-
body from Ab Frontier (Cat. No. LF-PA0030), anti-14-3-3 antibody was from Santa Cruz (Cat. No. sc-

 Cell Signaling Technologies and anti-a-tubulin antibody was from Sigma Aldrich (Cat. No. T9026).
Antibody to GLUT4 was generated in-house. Densitometry analysis was performed using Image Lab
5.2.1 (Bio-Rad) or Image Studio (LiCOR).
In vivo administration of CoQ
For studies in chow and HFHSD-fed mice, male C57BL/6J (n = 9 per treatment) fed ad libitum with
normal chow or HFHSD for a period of 14 d. Mice were treated with 10 mg/kg the liposomal CoQ10
(LiQsorb, Tichson Corp.) diluted in saline by intraperitoneal injection every 48 hr for the duration of
the feeding regimen. Control mice received saline. Mice were randomly assigned to a treatment
group so groups were equally represented within each cage.
For dose response studies, male C57BL/6J (n = 5 per treatment) fed ad libitum for a period of 14
d with HFHSD were treated with the specified dose of liposomal CoQ10 (LiQsorb, Tichson Corp.) (0,
1, 5 or 10 mg/kg) diluted in saline by intraperitoneal injection every 48 hr for the duration of the
feeding regimen. Saline was given to the control group. Mice were randomly assigned to a treat-
ment group so that at least one mouse per cage was in each group. For each mouse, epididymal fat
pads were assessed for mitochondrial content of CoQ9 and CoQ10, PRDX3 dimer/monomer status
and insulin sensitivity by the ex vivo 2DOG uptake assay. For ex vivo 2DOG uptake assay, saline-
injected chow mice were included as a control.
Inhibition of mevalonate pathway or CoQ synthesis
Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with 10 mM simvastatin or 20 mM atorvatstin for indi-
cated times or 2.5 mM 4-nitrobenzoic acid (Alam et al., 1975; Forsman et al., 2010) or 4-chloro-
benzoic acid (Bour et al., 2011) for 48 hr. These doses were selected to lower mitochondrial CoQ
content to that observed in insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
siRNA-mediated knockdown of Coq7 or Coq9
Seven days post-differentiation, adipocytes were trypsinised (5 � trypsin, EDTA) (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific) at 37˚C, washed twice with PBS, and re-suspended in electroporation solution (20 mM
HEPES, 135 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5% Ficoll 400, 1% DMSO, 2 mM ATP, and 5 mM glutathione,
pH 7.6) with 200 nM scrambled (sense 50-CAGTCGCGTTTGCGACTGGTT-30) or pooled anti-Coq7
siRNA (sense 50-GGGAUCACGCUGGUGAAUAUTT-30, 50-GGAUGACCUUAGACAAUAUTT-30, 50-
GCCUUGUUGAAGAGGAUUAUTT-30) or pooled anti-Coq9 siRNA (sense 50-GCAGCAUUCUGAGA-
CACAGTT-30, 50-GCUGGUGAUGAUGCAGGAUTT-30, 50- GCAAUGAACAUGGGCCACATT-30) or
(Shanghai Genepharma). Cells were electroporated at 200 mV for 20 ms using an ECM 830 square
wave electroporation system (BTX Molecular Delivery Systems) and seeded onto Matrigel (Corning)-
coated plates. Cells were assayed 96 hr following electroporation.
Sample preparation and real-time quantitative-PCR assays
Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNA synthesis
was carried out using PrimeScript first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech and Takara Bio Com-
pany). Polymerase chain reactions were performed on the LightCycler 480 II (Roche Applied Science)
using FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (Roche Applied Science). Cyclophilin b was used as an
internal control. The primer sets used were as follows: mCoq7_F; tttggaccatagctgcattg and

Mitochondrial bioenergetics in intact cells
The bioenergetics of intact cells was assessed as described previously (Krycer et al., 2017). Briefly,
On Day 7–8 of differentiation, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were trypsinised with 5x Trypsin/EDTA (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and seeded onto XFp cell culture plates coated
with Matrigel (Corning, distributed by Sigma Aldrich (Castle Hill, NSW, Australia)). Following the
indicated treatment, cells were washed three times with warm PBS, once with bicarbonate-free

 HEPES, and assayed in the XFp Analyzer in DMEM/HEPES with 25 mM galactose, 1 mM GlutaMAX
and 1 mM glutamine and 1 mM NaHCO3. During the assay, respiration was assayed with mix/wait/
read cycles of 3/0/2 min for 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Following assessment of basal respiration, the follow-
ing compounds were injected sequentially: oligoymcin (10 mg/ml), BAM15 (10 mM) (Kenwood et al.,
2014) rotenone/antimycin A (5 mM / 10 mM). All of these reagents were obtained from Sigma
Aldrich, except BAM15 (Kenwood et al., 2014). After the assay, the medium was aspirated and
DNA content was measured by Hoechst staining as described previously (Krycer et al., 2017).
Mitochondrial bioenergetics in permeabilised cells
3T3-L1 adipocytes were seeded into Matrigel-coated XFp cell culture plates as described above. Fol-
lowing the indicated treatment, cells were washed with warm PBS and incubated in mitochondrial
respiration buffer (20 mM K-HEPES pH 7.1, 0.5 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KH2PO4, 110 mM
D-sucrose, 0.1% (w/v) fatty-acid free BSA) for 30 min at 37˚C. Cells were permeabilised with 10 mg/
mL digitonin prior to equilibration in the Seahorse XFp Analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences). The follow-
ing injections were used: Port A: ADP-regeneration system (5 mM deoxyglucose, 1 U/mL hexokinase
(Roche), 1 mM ADP), 2 mM malate and 10 mM glutamate; Port B: 10 mM rotenone; Port C: 10 mM
succinate or 100 mM octanoylcarnitine; Port D: 10 mM antimycin A, 5 mM ascorbic acid and 0.5 mM
tetramethyl-phenylenediamine. Each cycle included 3 min mixing time, 0 min waiting time and 2 min
measuring time, repeated until a steady JO2 reading was obtained after each injection. Non-mito-
chondrial respiration was taken as JO2 following rotenone addition and this was subtracted from all
substrate-driven rates (ports A, C and D). State four respiration rates (proton leak) was determined
by omission of the ADP-regeneration system. All of these reagents were obtained from Sigma
Aldrich, unless otherwise stated. The resulting rate was normalised to DNA content, measured using
Hoechst 33248 with a previously-described Hoechst-staining protocol (Krycer et al., 2017).
Assessment of peroxiredoxin dimerisation
Sample preparation was carried out essentially as previously described (Bayer et al., 2013). For in
vitro studies, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pre-treated as indicated and washed three times with ice-cold
PBS that had been pre-treated with 10 mg/mL catalase for 1 hr. Cells were incubated with 100 mM
N-ethylmaleimide in PBS for 10 min on ice to modify free cysteine residues. Cells were scraped in
PBS-containing 1% SDS, protease inhibitors and 100 mM N-ethylmaleimide. For tissue preparation,
epididymal adipose tissue was immediately lysed in 2 x RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors
and 100 mM N-ethylmaleimide upon collection buffer by sonication (20 s). Samples were centrifuged
at 13,000 � g for 10 min at room temperature. Fat was removed, supernatant collected and protein
concentration determined by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Proteins were then separated by
non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Intensities of PRDX dimer and monomer bands were determined by densi-
tometry and ratios (dimer/monomer) expressed relative to control samples within each experiment.
Assessment of conversion of Mito-hydroethidine (MitoSOX) to Mito-2-
hydroxyethidium
Conversion of MitoSOX to Mito-2-hydroxyethidium was detected by LC-MS/MS, as previously
described (Zielonka et al., 2008) with modifications. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated as indicated
and incubated with 5 mM MitoSOX (Thermo Scientific) for 60 min in DMEM/GlutMAX without FCS.
Cells were scraped in ethanol and centrifuged at 17,000x g for 15 min, 4˚C. 5 mL of supernate were
then injected onto an Agilent 1290 UHPLC system connected to an Agilent 6490 triple-quadrupole
mass spectrometer. Analytes were separated on a 2.6 mm Kinetex XB-C18 100 A column (50 � 2.10
mm; Phenomenex) by gradient elution using mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid in water) and mobile
phase B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) at 0.4 mL/min. The gradient consisted of 25% mobile phase
B from 0 to 2 min, 25–40% B from 2 to 7 min, 40–90% B from 7 to 8 min, 90% B from 8 to 11 min
and back to 25% B from 11 to 12 min. Flow was then directed into the triple quadrupole mass spec-
trometer with parameters set as follows: gas temperature = 290˚C; gas flow = 14 L/min; nebulizer
pressure = 35 psi; sheath gas heater = 350˚C; sheath gas flow = 11 L/min; capillary voltage = 3,500
V. Detection of MitoSOX, Mito-ethidium (Mito-E+) and Mito-hydroxyethidium (Mito-2OHE+) was by
multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in positive ion mode using the above general mass spectrome-
try parameters with fragmentor voltage at 380 V and cell accelerator voltage at 5 V. In each case,

 the fragment ions generated by collision-induced dissociation of the [M + H]+or the [M + 2 hr]+ ions
were used for quantification. MRM settings for the target analytes were (parent ion fi fragment ion);
MitoSOX (m/z 632.2 fi 289) with collision energy (CE) = 25 V; Mito-E+ (m/z 315.7 fi 289) with CE =
25 V and Mito-2OHE+ (m/z 323.7 fi 289) with CE = 25 V. MitoSOX was quantified against authentic
commercial standard obtained from Invitrogen while Mito-E+ and Mito-2OHE+ were quantified
against standards synthesized from MitoSOX as previously described (Zielonka et al., 2008).
Treatment of adipocytes with mitochondrial poisons
3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated as indicated prior to treatment with 25 mM BAM15, 10 mM FCCP
(Sigma Aldrich), 10 mM rotenone (Sigma Aldrich), 50 nM antimycin A (Sigma Aldrich), 10 mg/mL oli-
gomycin (Sigma Aldrich), 10 or 100 mM TTFA (Sigma Aldrich) or 10 mM malonate (Sigma Aldrich) for
2 hr in DMEM/10% FCS/GlutaMAX before determination of PRDX dimerisation status. For assess-
ment of the effect of TTFA or malonate on HA-GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, cells were
incubated with 100 mM TTFA or 10 mM malonate for 2 hr in DMEM/10% FCS/GlutaMAX and for 2
hr during serum starvation in DMEM/0.2% BSA/GlutaMAX prior to assessment of insulin action.
Overexpression of mitochondrial-targeted catalase (mCat)
Mitochondrial-targeted human catalase (human catalase with the 24 residue MnSOD mitochondrial
localisation signal at its N-terminus) (Arita et al., 2006) was inserted into the pBABE-puro vector.
Mitochondrial-targeted catalase overexpressing 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were generated by retroviral
transduction as previously described (Govers et al., 2004). 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were transduced and
selected using puromycin. Fibroblasts were differentiated into adipocytes as described.
Statistical analyses
Data are expressed as means ± S.E.M. For each dataset, the sub-groups were initially compared
with the relevant ANOVA depending on the levels of treatments. If row or column factors were sig-
nificant, specific sub-groups were then compared using Student’s t-test (adjusting for multiple com-
parisons using the Sidak method). Significant effects were defined as p<0.05 by these t-tests, as
reported in the figures. Human data were assessed by Mann Whitney tests and significant effects
were defined as p<0.05.
