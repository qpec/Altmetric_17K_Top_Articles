ABSTRACT
Non-communicable disease is a leading threat to global
health. Physical inactivity is a large contributor to this
problem; in fact, the WHO ranks it as the fourth leading
risk factor for overall morbidity and mortality worldwide.
In Canada, at least 4 of 5 adults do not meet the
Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines of 150 min of
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week.
Physicians play an important role in the dissemination of
physical activity (PA) recommendations to a broad
segment of the population, as over 80% of Canadians
visit their doctors every year and prefer to get health
information directly from them. Unfortunately, most
physicians do not regularly assess or prescribe PA as part
of routine care, and even when discussed, few provide
specific recommendations. PA prescription has the
potential to be an important therapeutic agent for all
ages in primary, secondary and tertiary prevention of
chronic disease. Sport and exercise medicine (SEM)
physicians are particularly well suited for this role and
should collaborate with their primary care colleagues for
optimal patient care. The purpose of this Canadian
Academy and Sport and Exercise Medicine position
statement is to provide an evidence-based, best practices
summary to better equip SEM and primary care
physicians to prescribe PA and exercise, specifically for
the prevention and management of non-communicable
disease. This will be achieved by addressing common
questions and perceived barriers in the field.
INTRODUCTION
Non-communicable disease is a leading threat to
global health. Physical inactivity is a large contribu-
tor to this problem; in fact, the WHO ranks it as
the fourth leading risk factor for overall morbidity
and mortality worldwide.1 In Canada, at least four
of five adults do not meet the Canadian Physical
Activity
Guidelines
of
150 min
of
moderate-
to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per week.2 3
Prescription of physical activity (PA) is a key
element
of
the
multifaceted
societal
approach
needed to address inactivity.4 5 Substantial evidence
exists to support the benefits of exercise on at least
30
chronic
diseases6–10
as
well
as
the
cost-
effectiveness of exercise prescription in primary
care,11
12 even for cardiovascular (CV) disease
alone.13
Physicians play an important role in the dissem-
ination of PA recommendations to a broad segment
of the population. Over 80% of Canadians visit
their doctors every year and prefer to get health
information
directly
from
their
family
phys-
ician.14 15 Unfortunately, most physicians do not
regularly assess or prescribe PA as a part of routine
care,16–18 and even when discussed, few provide
specific recommendations.19
PA prescription has the potential to be an
important therapeutic agent for all ages in primary,
secondary
and
tertiary
prevention
of
chronic
disease. Sport and exercise medicine (SEM) physi-
cians are particularly well suited for this role and
should collaborate with their primary care collea-
gues for optimal patient care. W
e must act now to
correct the general lack of knowledge and training
in our medical schools and residency programmes
surrounding PA guidelines and prescription20–23 as
well. The purpose of this Canadian Academy and
Definitions: Physical activity (PA), defined as ‘any
bodily movement produced by skeletal muscle’,
and exercise, which generally involves structured
activity to improve a certain aspect of fitness,34
confer benefits with respect to chronic disease. PA
is further categorised as light, moderate and
vigorous (table 1). Sport is one form of delivery of
PA and exercise, but is not the focus of this
statement.

 Sport and Exercise Medicine (CASEM) position statement is
therefore to provide an evidence-based, best practices summary
to better equip SEM and primary care physicians to prescribe
PA and exercise, specifically for the prevention and manage-
ment of non-communicable disease. This will be achieved by
addressing common questions and perceived barriers in the
field.
How effective is exercise prescription by primary care
physicians?
Exercise prescription is effective at increasing PA levels24–26 and
can generate positive clinical outcomes such as reduced blood
pressure and glycosylated haemoglobin,27–29 as well as import-
ant positive effects on mental health,30–32 reducing risk of
depression33 and improving cognitive function in older adults
with dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD).35 From an effect-
iveness standpoint, the number needed to treat (NNT) for one
person to achieve the recommended adult PA guidelines of
150 min of MVPA per week, though brief physician counselling
is 12.36 This is at least fourfold lower than the clinical effort to
achieve a comparable health benefit of a smoker to quit
smoking, which has an NNT of 50–120.26
Challenges exist, such as time constraints, complex comorbid-
ities, perceived the lack of patient engagement and a lack of
physician training or education on particulars of PA counselling.
Some promising examples exist, however, such as Courneya
et al’s37 study, eliciting high rates of adherence to exercise pre-
scription in patients with cancer. Exercise prescription is cost-
effective and can increase PA by 10% in relatively inactive
patients,13 37 38 39 a number which recent Canadian evaluations
have estimated could save ∼2.1 billion dollars per year in
healthcare
and
other costs
if
adopted
at
the
population
level.40 41
Such counselling becomes even more effective in a range of
situations in which: (1) there is an increased risk of chronic
disease; (2) the encounter includes an individual assessment of
needs, motivation, habits, preferences and barriers; (3) the
message and goals are clear, simple and realistic; (4) valid behav-
ioural change approaches are used and (5) proper follow-up,
self-monitoring and social support are available.26 Medical prac-
titioners’ own PA habits influence their practice of PA history-
taking and exercise prescription as well.18
What are the key messages that should be given regarding
the effective dose of exercise for the prevention and
treatment of chronic disease?
In a landmark British Medical Journal paper examining the
head-to-head effects of medication versus PA/exercise in chronic
disease, Naci and Ioannidis42 from Stanford University made a
strong case for equivalent or superior effect of the health bene-
fits of PA. In particular, PA interventions were more effective
than drug treatment among patients with stroke and were as
effective as medications for the prevention of diabetes and sec-
ondary treatment of CV disease. PA can be as effective as medi-
cations for the treatment of depression43 and has a potent effect
on cognitive function in dementia in patients with AD and in
patients with a diagnosis of AD or non-AD dementia.35
Several high-level systematic reviews have also identified risk
reductions of 25–50% or more in most major chronic diseases
for
individuals
who
achieve
150 min
of
MVPA
per
week.9 26 44 45 A systematic review of nine cohort studies with a
mean follow-up of 9.8 years46 and two recent prospective
studies on large population cohorts (661 137 adults in the USA
and Europe and 204 542 adults in Australia, followed for 14
and 8 years, respectively) demonstrated clear dose–response
effects of PA to overall mortality;47 48 each 10 min of MVPA
accumulated per day led to a roughly 10% relative risk reduc-
tion in mortality, up to a 32–44% relative risk reduction at
150 min MVPA per week, depending on the amount of vigor-
ous activity as a part of the MVPA. The dose–response effect
appears to plateau at a 50–60% reduction at 3–5 times the
guidelines (ie, 750 min/week), and there is no evidence of
increased mortality at high levels of PA in generally healthy
individuals.
Although this target of 150 min may seem out of reach for
many who are sedentary, studies have shown significant benefits
for those who complete even small amounts of PA. The biggest
positive change in health risk is in going from inactive to some-
what active (ie, 75–90 min/week), resulting in a 15% reduction
in mortality risk.26
49 Simply reducing sedentary behaviour
confers short- and long-term health benefits,50 51 as prolonged
sedentary time is an independent predictor of adverse health
outcomes in adults.52
Long-term efficacy
Adherence to PA (as with other lifestyle modifications) tends to
decrease at 1 year, but can be sustained when activity is
repeated,53 or combined with community supports.54 The
Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) observed the maintenance
of adaptations and reduced diabetes incidence 10 years follow-
ing intensive support for PA during the study,55 as was the case
with a similar DPP in China56 57 which elicited reduced CV and
all-cause mortality and incidence of diabetes at 20 years. The
most cost-effective and practical option is brief PA counselling
through primary care, which is proven effective at improving PA
levels at 12 months following the intervention.26 Multiple ses-
sions may extend this time period even further,53 as does exer-
cise performed under supervision.58
How can brief exercise assessment and prescription be
integrated in primary care?
There is evidence that a 2–4 min intervention in primary care
effectively promotes PA.59 Asking two simple questions regard-
ing current PA (the exercise ‘vital sign’, ‘EVS’) at each visit can
further inform effective counselling: (1) ‘On average, how many
days/week do you engage in moderate or greater physical activ-
ity (like a brisk walk)?’ and (2) ‘On those days, how many
minutes do you engage in activity at this level?’60 Regular EVS
monitoring
can
change
physician
behaviour
and
improve
patients’ risk of disease.61 If the physician has more time than
that of a typical family practice appointment, motivational inter-
viewing is an effective method to raise the possibility of any
behavioural intervention.10 62
A written prescription (which comprises exercise and lifestyle
goals) is a crucial element to signal that PA and exercise can
be therapeutic.63 For patients with stable conditions, general
practitioners
can
provide
customised
exercise
prescription.
Incorporating discussions surrounding the use of advanced tech-
nology64 is discussed later in this article. Healthy patients are
encouraged to join community-based programmes and may
exercise
independently
without
supervision.
PA
guidelines
should also be prominent in the waiting room.
Physicians who do not have training in exercise prescription
may refer to skilled allied health professionals and to appropri-
ate community-based resources. Follow-up is crucial, however,
to signal the clinician’s conviction, determine the patient’s pro-
gress, solve problems, help identify social support, fine-tune the
dose and reset goals.

 What terminology and examples can be used to describe PA
intensity to patients?
Effective counselling requires physicians to clearly explain to
their patients what is meant by terms like MVPA and advise on
ways to limit sedentary behaviour. Different PA intensities are
described in table 1.
Activities that correspond to any given level of intensity will
change with the degree of an individual’s CV fitness; for
example, once a previously untrained patient has been regularly
active at a moderate intensity through walking for several
weeks, what counts as brisk at first may become a lighter inten-
sity exercise (boxes 1–3).
What are the safety considerations prior to initiation of an
exercise prescription?
For healthy patients, a gradual progression towards regular
MVPA is safe and recommended. Participation in light to mod-
erate
exercise
confers
very
little
risk
and
can
be
‘self-
administered’, akin to an over-the-counter medication.66 For
those with stable asymptomatic CV
, metabolic or renal disease,
medical clearance is not needed for patients already active, but
recommended for those who are inactive. Although these two
categories represent the majority of patients in a typical primary
care practice, physicians are often concerned with CV risk in
patients with more serious conditions.
Self-screening
instruments
such
as
the
Physical
Activity
Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q+)67 or the American College
of Sport Medicine (ACSM) health screening guidelines68 direct
people to a physician for further evaluation when current symp-
toms suggestive of CV
, metabolic or renal disease or complex
comorbidities are present. In these cases, the physician should
evaluate the clinical condition of the patient through a history
and physical examination that will focus on contraindications
to exercise. Patients with unstable angina, uncharacterised
arrhythmias or decompensated heart failure should not perform
vigorous exercise before their conditions stabilise. Physical
examination should focus on significant clinical signs, such as a
heart murmur, pulmonary overload or severe hypertension

Box 1
Key messages for patients during the discussion
of the health benefits of physical activity
▸ Exercise is more effective than medication for the treatment
of stroke and as effective for the secondary prevention of
coronary heart disease and diabetes.
▸ A 150 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA)
accumulated per week can reduce the risk of most major
chronic diseases by 25–50%.
▸ A 15 min of MVPA per day (or 75 min/week) is associated
with a ∼15% relative mortality risk reduction, and benefits
increase with the dose.
Box 2
Practical steps for immediate exercise prescription
▸ Ask about physical activity (PA) at every consultation.
▸ A written prescription building towards accumulating
150 min/week is crucial—it takes just 30 s to do this.
▸ Encourage the patient to measure (eg, pedometer and smart
phone) and record their PA (paper and mobile app).
▸ Refer on as appropriate—consider appropriate physicians,
physiotherapists, clinical exercise physiologists, kinesiologists
and certified fitness instructors.
▸ Follow-up with the patient to chart progress, set goals, solve
problems, and identify and use social support.

 (resting blood pressure >200/110 mm Hg), which can indicate
potential heightened risk.36 69
The estimated prevalence of complications requiring hospitali-
sation (including serious arrhythmias), acute myocardial infarc-
tion or sudden cardiac death (SCD) during or immediately after
a stress test are ≤0.2%, 0.04% and 0.01%, respectively.70
Vigorous intensity exercise acutely, albeit transiently, increases
CV events.71 In a prospective study of sport-related SCD in the
general population, however, the incidence of SCD was esti-
mated to 4.6 per million population per year or 0.00046%.72
Based on these numbers, it can be concluded that the gradual
progression towards MVPA by a sedentary patient with stable
chronic conditions and a normal history and physical is asso-
ciated with such a low rate of CV events that further formal CV
testing is not indicated.
High-intensity interval training
Recently, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been pro-
moted based on several systematic reviews,73 74 showing greater
benefits on CV fitness compared to lower intensity continuous
training. HIIT involves alternate bursts of short, intense PA
interspersed with recovery periods and appears to be safe for
rehabilitation of patients with coronary artery disease and heart
failure,75 although there are conflicting opinions in the literature
as to its effectiveness and safety for population-level exercise.76
For patients considered at higher CV risk, therefore, stress
testing is advised.
Is it safe to prescribe exercise if my patient has
osteoarthritis or other comorbidities?
Several recent systematic reviews demonstrate that aerobic and
resistance exercise will not result in increased pain or disability
in patients with osteoarthritis.78–81 In fact, both types of train-
ing generally reduce pain and increase function; further sup-
porting the expert consensus recommendations that PA should
be a part of management.82–84
Regarding individualised adaptation of exercise prescription
to specific chronic disease, the reader is referred to the free
online textbook provided by the Swedish Institute of Public
Health10 and two recent review articles.9 85 In general, as men-
tioned earlier, if the patient has one or two stable chronic dis-
eases and is otherwise healthy, PA can be self-administered, with
a gradual progression towards the adult PA guidelines.
Which tools can help patients adopt active behaviours?
While the ubiquity of mobile phones and wearable technology
may present a simpler method for clinicians to assess and
promote active behaviours in primary care, the evidence in this
area is still underdeveloped.86 Meta-analysis of pedometer use
demonstrates average increases of over 2000 steps in partici-
pants’ steps per day.87 Step count targets for adults, using a
guide of 100 steps/min as ‘moderate intensity’, are in the range
of roughly 7100–11 000 steps per day, with <5000 steps a day
leading to adverse health outcomes;88 therefore, this can repre-
sent a significant improvement.
Data extraction may be time-consuming for patient and clin-
ician, however, which may explain low levels of user adoption,
despite the benefits of many PA monitors. Individuals using
wearable technology to improve their health exhibit the most
consistent usage when tracking is simple and automatic.89 Other
technologies that may improve adherence to PA are text messa-
ging90 and ‘exergames’.91 92 Advances in the field of mobile
apps for PA monitoring for health will inevitably continue and
become more user-friendly for patients and doctors. Physicians
are encouraged to be flexible and creative in their adoption of
new devices to this end.
How can exercise professionals contribute to the
implementation of an active lifestyle?
The role of exercise professionals through physician referral of
patients must be carefully considered, so that an additional
burden of treatment such as added costs for the patient or ease
of access limitations do not raise barriers to integration of daily
PA. Avoiding these and other potential obstacles is of particular
concern for lower socioeconomic groups; medical professionals
must be aware that those most at risk of disease are often the
least able to afford the cure. In most cases, physicians should
feel enabled to prescribe PA without referral, assuming appro-
priate safety considerations are made and gradual introduction
of PA for the sedentary patient is advised. Nevertheless, physi-
cians are encouraged to identify potential partners within their
communities (eg, local recreation centres, sports programmes
and walking/running groups) to build effective networks for
patient referral and/or direction when desired.
Exercise professionals and other PA facilitators can be import-
ant members of an integrated approach to design and delivery of
interventions, although experts point to the lack of evidence and
sustainability for exercise referral schemes.93–96 Referral to a
qualified exercise professional is most indicated for patients
with conditions classified as high risk of morbidity and mor-
tality associated with the lack of PA (CV disease and type 2
diabetes), as well as special populations that would benefit
from PA but have difficulty engaging due to low motivation
or safety concerns (patients with cancer, epilepsy or pulmon-
ary disease). In many patients with chronic disease such as
diabetes, exercise programmes are most effective when super-
vised.97 Therefore, the role of the exercise professional is to
ensure safety and adaptation to ability level of the patient and
to ensure accountability for maximal treatment efficacy.
It is important to remember that patient empowerment is
essential and the physician must communicate his or her belief
that the patient is capable of change. Considerations should be
made for the education and awareness-building for the patient,
family and support network as a part of the total programme.
CONCLUSION
Primary care providers, and particularly SEM physicians, have
an important opportunity to make PA an integral component of
the prevention and treatment of chronic disease. It is the
Box 3
Key messages regarding cardiovascular safety
▸ For generally healthy individuals, moderate exercise is safe.
If inactive, begin with lower intensity and progress in
duration and intensity over time.
▸ Progression towards recommended volumes of moderate-to-
vigorous physical activity (MVPA) can be prescribed to
patients with chronic disease. If inactive initially, a normal
clinical evaluation is recommended. If already active,
medical clearance is recommended before engaging in
vigorous activities.
▸ Initiation of high-intensity physical activity, such as
high-intensity interval training, should be preceded by
establishing a ‘base fitness level’ over several weeks through
regular MVPA.77

 position of the CASEM that all SEM and primary care physi-
cians should include PA assessment and prescription as part of
routine healthcare for patients, and this should be a priority for
training and education at every level of medicine.
Recommendations from physicians influence patient engage-
ment and improve the likelihood of adoption. CASEM further
recommends that clinicians lead by example and integrate PA
into their own lives, for their own health and well-being, and to
provide further credibility and empathy for the challenges
patients face.
Physical inactivity is and will remain one of the gravest threats
to public health for this and future generations of Canadians
unless a catalyst for change can be found. With a simple pre-
scription for PA, front-line physicians have one more tool to
bring about real change in the lives of Canadians. With the evi-
dence summarised in this review, the message is clear that PA
prescription works and costs less than relying on the alternatives
alone. The time to act is now.
