IMPORTANCE Rates of obesity and diabetes have increased substantially in recent decades;
however, the potential role of the built environment in mitigating these trends is unclear.
OBJECTIVE To examine whether walkable urban neighborhoods are associated with a slower
increase in overweight, obesity, and diabetes than less walkable ones.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Time-series analysis (2001-2012) using annual
provincial health care (N ≈ 3 million per year) and biennial Canadian Community Health
Survey (N ≈ 5500 per cycle) data for adults (30-64 years) living in Southern Ontario cities.
EXPOSURES Neighborhood walkability derived from a validated index, with standardized
scores ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more walkability. Neighborhoods
were ranked and classified into quintiles from lowest (quintile 1) to highest (quintile 5)
walkability.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Annual prevalence of overweight, obesity, and diabetes
incidence, adjusted for age, sex, area income, and ethnicity.
RESULTS Among the 8777 neighborhoods included in this study, the median walkability index
was 16.8, ranging from 10.1 in quintile 1 to 35.2 in quintile 5. Resident characteristics were
generally similar across neighborhoods; however, poverty rates were higher in high- vs
low-walkability areas. In 2001, the adjusted prevalence of overweight and obesity was lower
in quintile 5 vs quintile 1 (43.3% vs 53.5%; P < .001). Between 2001 and 2012, the prevalence
increased in less walkable neighborhoods (absolute change, 5.4% [95% CI, 2.1%-8.8%] in
quintile 1, 6.7% [95% CI, 2.3%-11.1%] in quintile 2, and 9.2% [95% CI, 6.2%-12.1%] in quintile
3). The prevalence of overweight and obesity did not significantly change in areas of higher
walkability (2.8% [95% CI, −1.4% to 7.0%] in quintile 4 and 2.1% [95% CI, −1.4% to 5.5%] in
quintile 5). In 2001, the adjusted diabetes incidence was lower in quintile 5 than other
quintiles and declined by 2012 from 7.7 to 6.2 per 1000 persons in quintile 5 (absolute
change, −1.5 [95% CI, −2.6 to −0.4]) and 8.7 to 7.6 in quintile 4 (absolute change, −1.1 [95% CI,
−2.2 to −0.05]). In contrast, diabetes incidence did not change significantly in less walkable
areas (change, −0.65 in quintile 1 [95% CI, −1.65 to 0.39], −0.5 in quintile 2 [95% CI, −1.5 to
0.5], and −0.9 in quintile 3 [95% CI, −1.9 to 0.02]). Rates of walking or cycling and public
transit use were significantly higher and that of car use lower in quintile 5 vs quintile 1 at each
time point, although daily walking and cycling frequencies increased only modestly from
2001 to 2011 in highly walkable areas. Leisure-time physical activity, diet, and smoking
patterns did not vary by walkability (P > .05 for quintile 1 vs quintile 5 for each outcome) and
were relatively stable over time.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In Ontario, Canada, higher neighborhood walkability was
associated with decreased prevalence of overweight and obesity and decreased incidence of
diabetes between 2001 and 2012. However, the ecologic nature of these findings and the
lack of evidence that more walkable urban neighborhood design was associated with
increased physical activity suggest that further research is necessary to assess whether the
observed associations are causal.

T
he global increase in obesity is a major contemporary
health problem. The National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey estimated that 69% of US adults
were overweight or obese in 2011-2012, whereas 35% met the
definition of obesity, an increase in obesity prevalence from
15% in the late 1970s.1,2 A parallel increase in diabetes preva-
lence among adults occurred during the latter half of this
period, from less than 4% in 1990 to 8.3% in 2012.3,4 Similar
trends have been observed in Canada and other nations
worldwide.5,6
Despite public health efforts to reduce obesity through
diet and exercise, rates of overweight, obesity, and diabetes
remain high, prompting a search for population-wide strate-
gies to help curb these dual epidemics. One approach that is
gaining interest among public health professionals and
urban planners is to redesign the built environment to offer
more opportunities for physical activity and healthy eating.
Urban design preferences during the past 40 years have
shifted toward sprawling, car-oriented communities that
discourage walking and increase reliance on motorized
transportation. In contrast, neighborhoods that favor pedes-
trian activities—those with high population density, high
numbers of destinations within walking distance of residen-
tial areas, and well-connected streets—are characterized by
higher rates of walking and bicycling for transportation and
lower rates of car use.7,8 In turn, research has linked resi-
dence in these more walkable areas to lower levels of obe-
sity and diabetes.9-13
To our knowledge, no prospective studies have exam-
ined the capacity for walkable neighborhoods to mitigate the
increase in obesity-related diseases on a population scale. The
primary objective of this study was to examine whether ur-
ban neighborhoods that are more walkable are associated with
a slower increase in overweight, obesity, and diabetes than less
walkableneighborhoodsand,ifso,whetherthesepatternscor-
respond to transportation choices within neighborhoods.
Methods
Context and Setting
A time-series analysis was conducted to compare rates of
overweight, obesity, and diabetes incidence during a 12-year
period across urban neighborhoods with various levels of
walkability. This study was conducted in metropolitan areas
within Southern Ontario, a region that is highly urbanized
and undergoing rapid growth and development. The study
area included 15 municipalities with a combined population
of more than 7 million residents (London, Ottawa, Hamilton,
Toronto, and surrounding communities), representing
approximately one-fifth of the Canadian population. Data
collected from administrative health care databases and
national surveys were used to derive population-level esti-
mates for overweight, obesity, and diabetes for the popula-
tion living in this area. To do so, health information for local
residents was linked to neighborhood-level data on walkabil-
ity, using their postal code of residence. The sample in this
study included the adult population aged 30 to 64 years, a
group that has experienced a rapid increase in obesity-related
conditions, including diabetes.5
This protocol received ethical approval from the institu-
tional review boards at St Michael’
s Hospital and Sunnybrook
Health Sciences Centre in Toronto and from the Institute for
Clinical Evaluative Sciences, where the data are held. Partici-
pant informed consent was not required by any of these re-
search institutes in accordance with Ontario’
s privacy legisla-
tion because all data were maintained in a deidentified form.
Neighborhood Walkability
Baseline walkability scores were calculated for residential
units (known as dissemination areas) within the study
region. Dissemination areas are the smallest geographic unit
for which Canadian census data are available and are rela-
tively uniform in terms of population size (approximately
400-700 persons). Dissemination areas are generally com-
posed of several adjacent city blocks and have several postal
codes within their boundary (median = 13). Only residential
areas that were developed before 2001 and classified by
Statistics Canada as urban areas (which includes suburban
areas) were included in this study. Fringe areas on the out-
skirts of a city that were largely rural or undeveloped were
excluded.
Neighborhood walkability was derived for each dissemi-
nation area with a validated composite walkability index.10,11
The index includes 4 equally weighted components: popula-
tion density (number of persons per square kilometer), resi-
dential density (number of occupied residential dwellings per
square kilometer), walkable destinations (number of retail
stores, services [eg, libraries, banks, community centers], and
schools within a 10-minute walk), and street connectivity
(number of intersections with at least 3 converging roads or
pathways).
In a validation study, index scores derived from equally
weighting these components were highly correlated with
those in which weights were based on factor scores from
principal components analysis (R>0.99).10 The index was
created with ArcGIS version 10.2 and data from the 2001
Canadian Census and 2003 DMTI Spatial Inc (Enhanced
Points of Interest file), supplemented with data on locations
of public recreational facilities from local municipalities and
schools from the Ontario government’
s Ministry of Educa-
tion. Residential areas were then ordered by increasing
walkability scores and divided into quintiles, from the least
(quintile 1) to the most walkable quintile (quintile 5). For
descriptive purposes, scores were standardized to a scale
from 0 to 100. To assess the stability of walkability quintiles
over time, walkability scores were recreated for each neigh-
borhood with data from the 2006 Canadian Census and
2009 DMTI Spatial Inc.
Other Neighborhood Variables
A number of additional variables were measured, including
factors that could contribute to the association between
walkability and study outcomes or that could be potential
confounders. Because neighborhood gentrification (the
influx of wealthier persons into neighborhoods, displacing

poorer residents) may have occurred in highly walkable areas
during the follow-up, a number of socioeconomic and retail
measures were compared at the start and end of this period
that reflected the underlying wealth of neighborhoods in
each walkability quintile. This included socioeconomic
indicators—the level of poverty, education, and unemploy-
ment; the number of dwellings requiring major repairs; and
the percentage of the population who did not speak English
or French—based on the 2001 Canadian Census and the 2011
National Household Survey (which replaced the long form of
the 2011 Canadian Census); retail indicators, including the
availability of private gyms or fitness clubs (number per
capita) and the availability of a particular specialty coffee
house (number per capita) vs a particular coffee and dough-
nut shop (number per capita); and the ratio of specialty cof-
fee houses to coffee and doughnut shops (based on these
same measures), derived from Enhanced Points of Interest
data from DMTI Spatial Inc (2003 and 2012).14,15 Access to
local parks was assessed by calculating the distance to the
nearest park (in meters) for each dissemination area. Park-
land was captured with several measures from DMTI Spatial
Inc (2003 and 2009); very small parks (<20 000 m2) were
excluded. In addition, access to health care services was
examined across neighborhoods by measuring the number of
primary care visits per year among local residents according
to fee-for-service physicians’services claims.
Outcomes
Overweight/Obesity
The prevalence of overweight and obesity was estimated for
each quintile of neighborhood walkability with self-reported
data from the Canadian Community Health Survey, which is
a series of cross-sectional nationally representative health sur-
veys of Canadians aged 12 years and older and is conducted
by Statistics Canada. Details on the survey design and sam-
pling frame have been published elsewhere.16 To evaluate pat-
terns over time, data from 6 consecutive cycles, released ap-
proximately every 2 years from 2001 to 2011/2012, were
analyzed; the prevalence between years was derived through
interpolation.
Prevalence of overweight and obesity was derived for each
cycle with data from all respondents aged 30 to 64 years who
were living in the study area when the survey was con-
ducted, excluding women who were pregnant or breastfeed-
ing. Body mass index was calculated with self-reported weight
and height measurements according to a standard formula
(weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). Be-
cause certain ethnic groups have an elevated diabetes risk at
lower BMI levels,17-19 ethnic-specific BMI thresholds were used
to define overweight or obesity based on self-reported ethnic-
ity derived from predefined racial or cultural group catego-
ries created by Statistics Canada, using a threshold of 23 or
higher for South Asian and Chinese respondents and 25 or
greater for all others.
Diabetes Incidence
Administrative health data collected from April 1, 2001, to
March 31, 2013, were used to calculate the annual incidence
of diabetes within each quintile of neighborhood walkability.
Because of Canada’
s universal health care system, adminis-
trative health care databases include anonymized health
information on virtually all permanent residents. Yearly
denominators were derived from the electronic health care
registry that captures demographic, residential, and vital sta-
tistics data. Numerators were based on new diabetes cases
identified from the Ontario Diabetes Database. The database
uses a validated algorithm based on hospitalization records
and physicians’services claims to identify persons with diag-
nosed diabetes, with a high level of sensitivity (86%) and
specificity (97%).20 The database is unable to distinguish
cases of type 1 from type 2 diabetes; however, the majority of
new cases in the study would be expected to be type 2, given
the minimum age criterion of 30 years.
Yearly diabetes incidence rates were calculated among
adults aged 30 to 64 years who were living in the study area
and were free of diabetes at the start of each fiscal year. Only
individuals who were eligible for health care coverage for a
minimum of 3 years before each fiscal year were included to
ensure that new entries into the database were truly incident
cases.Individualslivinginlong-termcareinstitutionswerealso
excluded.
Transportation and Health Behaviors
Self-reported transportation behaviors were examined by
neighborhood walkability, with data collected from a ran-
domly selected sample of households that were participating
in one of 3 cycles (2001, 2006, and 2011) of the Transporta-
tion Tomorrow Survey, a comprehensive telephone-based
household survey (switched to online in 2011) conducted in
theGreaterTorontoandHamiltonAreaeverycensusyear,with
an average annual sample size of 128 420.21 The contact and
refusal rates across the 3 cycles ranged from 60% to 81% and
21%to26%,respectively,resultinginanoverallcompletionrate
of 64.1% in 2001, 45.7% in 2006, and 48.9% in 2011. Valida-
tion studies suggest that survey participants were highly rep-
resentative of the census population living in the same
areas.21-23 Furthermore, there was a high level of agreement
between daily transit and driving trip volumes from self-
reported data collected in the Transportation Tomorrow Sur-
vey and counts derived from regional transit authorities and
cordon count programs (direct observation of traffic), with
overallcountswithin3%.22,23Transportationpatternswereex-
amined among all eligible respondents living in the study area
at the time of the survey, according to their walkability quin-
tile. These data were reported as the weighted mean number
of daily trips per 100 persons by walking or bicycling, public
transit, and automobile.
Data from the Canadian Community Health Survey were
used to examine self-reported health behaviors during the
same period by neighborhood walkability, including the
proportion of the eligible population who were inactive in
their leisure time (not including transportation-related
activities according to an energy expenditure <1.5 kcal/kg
per day), consumed fewer than 5 servings of fruits and veg-
etables daily, or were current smokers. These data were
available for 4 consecutive survey cycles (spanning 2003 to

between cycles.
Analysis
Stability of Walkability Measure Over Time
Inthemainanalysis,walkabilitywasconsideredtoberelatively
stable over time and was not treated as a time-dependent vari-
able. To test this assumption, a weighted κ statistic was used to
examinetheagreementbetweenneighborhood-levelwalkabil-
ity scores at baseline (2001-2003) and later during follow-up
(2006-2009).
Temporal Patterns of Overweight and Obesity
Annual rates of overweight and obesity (using ethnic-specific
cut-offs as described above) were estimated for each walk-
ability quintile and were age and sex standardized, incorpo-
rating survey sampling weights and using the 1991 Canadian
population as the referent population. The Proc LOESS proce-
dure in SAS, a nonparametric method that allows fitting of
nonlinear curves, was used to smooth the plotted curves
demonstrating the relationship between overweight and obe-
sity prevalence and time. Poisson regression was used to
adjust for area-level poverty. It was also used to test for dif-
ferences in slopes of the modeled rates of overweight and
obesity over time within a given walkability quintile, as well
as differences between quintile 5 (highest walkability) and
quintile 1 (lowest walkability) at the start and end of the
observation period. These models were created with indi-
viduals as the unit of analysis. Individuals living in dissemi-
nation areas that had missing census data on neighborhood
income or ethnicity were excluded from the analysis, as were
those with missing BMI.
Temporal Patterns of Diabetes Incidence
Modeling was performed with the residential area as the unit
of analysis. Random-effects Poisson models were used to de-
rive diabetes incidence rates after adjusting for age, sex, area-
level income, and ethnicity and to account for the clustered
nature of the data. Poisson regression was then used to evalu-
atemodeleddiabetesincidenceratesovertime,withthepopu-
lationatriskasanoffset.Plottedincidenceratesweresmoothed
withthesamemethoddescribedabove.Interactiontermswere
used to detect any differences in slope (change in diabetes in-
cidenceovertime)withinandacrosswalkabilityquintiles,com-
paring quintiles 1 and 5 at the start and end of the observation
period.Areaswithmissingcensusvariableswereexcludedfrom
the analysis.
As a sensitivity analysis, the relationship between walk-
ability and diabetes incidence was examined across neigh-
borhoods with different levels of poverty. To do so, Poisson
regression was used to examine the association between
standardized walkability scores and diabetes incidence in
2012, adjusting for age, sex, and area ethnicity and stratifying
into 3 groups on the basis of poverty (tertiles of the percent-
age of residents living below the low-income cutoff). Models
accounted for potential underdispersion and overdispersion
of data and were rerun with and without accounting for the
clustering of residents in the same neighborhoods. The intra-
class correlation coefficient derived from the model was used
to assess the within- and between-neighborhood variance.
Temporal Patterns in Transportation- and Health-Related Behaviors
Similar approaches were used to examine temporal patterns
in transportation- and health-related behaviors by neighbor-
hood walkability. These models were created with individu-
als as the unit of analysis.
All analyses were performed with SAS version 9.4. All sta-
tistical tests were 2-sided, with a threshold for significance of
P < .05.
Results
Neighborhood Characteristics
Overall,therewere8793residentialneighborhoodsinthestudy
area. Sixteen were excluded because of missing census data;
however, this represented less than 0.1% of the eligible study
population. Compared with residents living in the least walk-
able neighborhoods, those in the most walkable areas were
somewhat younger and more likely to be nonwhite or to have
immigrated to Canada in the preceding 10 years (Table 1). Pov-
erty rates were higher in high-walkability (quintile 5) vs low-
walkability(quintile1)neighborhoods,butdecreasedtoasmall
extent in quintile 4 (−2.5%) and quintile 5 (−4.3%) during the
study (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Levels of education and
unemployment were similar in quintiles 1 and 5 at the start and
end of the period despite small increases in both during follow-
up. The retail environment remained relatively stable during
the study, although quintile 5 had a greater concentration of
specialtycoffeehouses,withfewercoffeeanddoughnutshops
at baseline and a greater increase in both during this period of
the study. Access to commercial gyms and fitness clubs was
greater in both low- and high-walkability areas but by 2012 had
decreased in quintile 5; however, access to parks was similar
across all neighborhood types.
Neighborhood walkability scores ranged from 0 to 100
(median, 16.8), with a fairly skewed distribution (median of
10.1 in quintile 1 and 35.2 in quintile 5). During the follow-up
period, most neighborhoods remained in the same quintile
(78% overall, 95% in quintile 5) and 99% remained within 1
quintile of their baseline assignment (weighted κ for agree-
ment = 0.85). In addition, the area population and residen-
tial density, street connectivity, and number of retail outlets
and services in each quintile were fairly stable (eTable 2 in the
Supplement).
Prevalence of Overweight and Obesity
Overall, there were 32 767 individuals who participated in the
Canadian Community Health Survey between 2001 and 2012
(≈5500 per cycle) and met the inclusion criteria for this study;
thesamplesizebycyclerangedfrom4878to6165andwassimi-
lar across quintiles (7686 in quintile 1 and 5576 in quintile 5).
Overall, the proportion of individuals in the sample (N = 1293;
3.9%) who had missing BMI data was similar across quintiles.
The most walkable neighborhoods (quintile 5) had a lower
adjusted prevalence of overweight and obesity at all points

during the observation window (Figure 1) after accounting for
differences in age, sex, income, and ethnicity (43.3% vs 53.5%
in quintile 1 vs quintile 5; absolute difference, −10.2% [95% CI,
−13.5% to −6.8%; P < .001]). The prevalence increased signifi-
cantly in the lower 3 categories of walkability between 2001
and 2012 (change in prevalence, 5.4% [95% CI, 2.1% to 8.8%;
P = .002], 6.7% [95% CI, 2.3% to 11.1%; P = .003], and 9.2%
[95% CI, 6.2% to 12.1%; P < .001] in quintiles 1, 2, and 3, re-
spectively).Incontrast,therewasnosignificantchangeinrates
of overweight and obesity in neighborhoods within the top 2
quintiles of walkability (2.8% in quintile 4 [95% CI, −1.4% to
7.0%; P = .20] and 2.1% in quintile 5 [95% CI, −1.4% to 5.5%;
P = .20]). By 2012, the difference in prevalence between the
highest- and lowest-walkability quintile had increased (45.4%
vs 58.9%; absolute difference, −13.5% [95% CI, −16.9% to
−10.2%]; P < .001).
Diabetes Incidence
This analysis included nearly 3 million persons per year (rang-
ing from 2 775 781 in fiscal year 2001 to 2 906 539 in 2012). The
population size was similar across quintiles: 553 144 in quin-
tile 1 and 568 646 in quintile 5 in fiscal year 2001, increasing
to 658 267 and 586 996, respectively, by 2012.
Temporal patterns in diabetes incidence were similar to
those observed for overweight and obesity. After adjusting
for area differences in age, sex, income, and ethnicity, the
incidence of diabetes was lowest in the highest-walkability
neighborhoods compared with less walkable areas through-
out the 12-year period (Figure 2). The adjusted annual inci-
dence of diabetes decreased significantly in the highest 2
walkability quintiles, from 8.7 to 7.6 per 1000 persons in
quintile 4 (absolute change, −1.1 [95% CI, −2.2 to −0.05])
and 7.7 to 6.2 per 1000 persons in quintile 5 (absolute

diabetes incidence was not significantly different in 2012
compared with baseline (change, −0.65 in quintile 1 [95% CI,
−1.65 to 0.39; P = .20], −0.5 in quintile 2 [95% CI, −1.5 to
0.5; P = .30], and −0.9 in quintile 3 [95% CI, −1.9 to 0.02;
P = .06]). By 2012, the adjusted diabetes incidence was 1.7
per 1000 persons lower in the highest- vs lowest-walkability
neighborhoods (6.2 vs 7.9 per 1000; absolute difference,
−1.7 [95% CI, −2.8 to −0.7]; P = .001).
In the sensitivity analysis, walkability was inversely re-
lated to diabetes incidence in neighborhoods of various
income levels. For every 5-point increase in neighborhood
walkability score (treated as a continuous variable), the rela-
tive risk of diabetes was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.96-0.96), 0.95 (95%
CI,0.94-0.96),and0.96(95%CI,0.95-0.97)inareaswithlower,

Transportation Behaviors
At each point, residents in the most walkable neighbor-
hoods had higher rates of daily walking or cycling (28 vs 3
per 100 persons in 2011; difference, 25 per 100; 95% CI,
24-26; P = <.001) and public transit trips (58 vs 20 per 100
persons in 2011; difference, 38 per 100 persons; 95% CI,
36-40; P < .001) and lower rates of daily driving trips (145 vs
250 per 100 persons in 2011; difference, −105 per 100 (95%
CI, −110 to −100; P < .001) compared with those living in the
least walkable areas (Figure 3). During the 10-year period,
there were modest increases in walking and cycling in
highly walkable areas, equivalent to 7 additional daily trips
per 100 persons.
Other Health Behaviors
There was little variation in rates of physical inactivity dur-
ing leisure time, inadequate fruit and vegetable consump-
tion, and smoking in the population during the study and
no association between neighborhood walkability and any
of these health behaviors (Table 2). Primary care use was

(median of 2 visits in the previous year [interquartile range,
0-5] in 2001 and 2012).
Discussion
This study found that urban neighborhoods that were char-
acterized by more walkable urban design were associated with
a stable prevalence of overweight and obesity and declining
diabetes incidence during a 12-year period. By 2012, rates of
eachoftheseconditionsweresignificantlylowerinthesehighly
walkable neighborhoods compared with less walkable areas,
in which levels of obesity continued to increase.
To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to ex-
amine the association between neighborhood walkability and
concomitant health outcomes (overweight/obesity and diabe-
tes). The strengths of this study include its large sample size,
its population-based nature, and the consistency of findings
across outcomes ascertained by using different data sources.
The relationships observed were not linear in that body weight
and diabetes risk were lower only in higher-walkability neigh-
borhoods. The consistency of the relationship between walk-
ability and obesity-related outcomes has been borne out in
other studies conducted in North American cities.9-12 Al-
though the majority of earlier studies on this topic were cross-
sectional, there is some evidence from smaller prospective
studies that individuals living in environments that support
walking and other physical activities experience less weight
gain and are less likely to develop insulin resistance or
diabetes.11,12,24,25 However, several of these studies mea-
suredwalkabilityaccordingtoresidents’perceptions,andnone
addressed the issue that residents living in walkable areas may
be inherently healthier or more physically active.
In addition, the observed patterns are not easily ex-
plained by other confounders. The analysis accounted for dif-
ferences in the ethnic composition and socioeconomic char-
acteristicsofeachresidentialarea.Therewasnoindicationthat
highly walkable areas were undergoing rapid shifts in wealth
compared with less walkable neighborhoods, although there
was a modest decrease in poverty in these areas, with a con-
comitant increase in education level. Although there is evi-
dence that low-income neighborhoods have higher levels of
obesity and diabetes, the changes in poverty observed during
this period were likely too small to explain a decline in diabe-
tesincidenceofthismagnitude.26,27Furthermore,povertylev-
els remained 9% higher in the most vs least walkable areas at
the end of the study period, and changes in socioeconomic sta-
tus were accounted for in the analysis.
Although residents living in more walkable areas may be
expected to be more health conscious, they reported that they
were no more likely to engage in leisure-time physical activ-
ity, nor did they report having a better-quality diet or smok-
ing less. There were also no significant differences across quin-
tileswithrespecttoaccesstoparks,fitnessclubs,orhealthcare.
Recent studies suggest that individuals who regularly engage
in walking and cycling or who use public transit may be more
likelytoachievethe30ormorerecommendedminutesofmod-
erate to vigorous physical activity per day.7 In contrast, driv-
ing has been linked to a higher likelihood of obesity, similar
to other sedentary behaviors.9,28 However, although the re-
lationships observed are plausible from an etiologic perspec-
tive, rates of walking or cycling increased only modestly dur-
ing the study. Thus, it is not possible to directly ascribe
population-level changes in overweight, obesity, and diabe-
tes to transportation choices. Further research is needed to un-
derstand whether the relationship between walkability and
obesity-related outcomes is causal and, if so, whether trans-
portation patterns mediate such effects.
Findings from this study revealed a continuing increase
in obesity-related outcomes in less walkable areas, although
rates increased less sharply than in earlier decades, with a
plateauing of diabetes incidence from approximately 2006
onward. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey and other US surveys suggest that the epi-
demic of obesity and diabetes has slowed in the United
States.1-4 Studies from the United Kingdom, Sweden, Swit-
zerland, and Spain have reported a similar phenomenon,
with relatively stable levels during the past decade.29-33 Dur-
ing the same period, rates of walking, cycling, and public
transportation use increased modestly, whereas driving rates
decreased. Although this may be due in part to increasing oil
prices or traffic congestion, there have been major public
health efforts to promote physical activity and healthier eat-
ing through public policies, social advocacy, and media
campaigns.34,35 Simultaneously, there has been increasing
awareness among clinicians and public health officials of the
effectiveness of intensive lifestyle strategies for diabetes pre-
vention after such landmark trials as the Diabetes Prevention
Program.36 Despite increased public awareness and repeated
messaging, individuals may be able to act only when oppor-
tunities for physical activity exist, in the presence of a per-
missive and supportive environment.
There are several limitations to this study that merit dis-
cussion. Self-selection may have contributed to observed dif-
ferences in outcomes across neighborhoods. However, key so-
ciodemographic variables that are related to obesity and
diabetes were controlled for in the analysis, including age, in-
come,andethnicity.Thiswasnotarandomizedtrial,andthere-
fore it is possible that unmeasured confounders (eg, occupa-
tion) contributed to the findings. Assigning causation to
neighborhood walkability requires caution because of the dif-
ficulty in disentangling its effects from that of other neighbor-
hood exposures, such as socioeconomic status, using obser-
vational data. However, the relationship between walkability
and diabetes incidence was consistent across neighborhoods
of various income levels. Moreover, there may be other char-
acteristics of highly walkable areas that relate to better health
thatwerenotmeasured;forinstance,accesstohealthierfood.37
TheTransportationTomorrowSurveyprovideddataonthefre-
quency of walking or cycling trips, but information on the cu-
mulative duration of such trips and overall energy expendi-
ture devoted to transportation was lacking. Other limitations
include the use of self-reported rather than measured BMI,
which could have led to underestimating the true prevalence
of overweight and obesity; self-report may have also led to

overreporting the amount of physical activity. Validation stud-
ies have found that obesity is underestimated in the Canadian
Community Health Survey by 6% to 9% in all cycles; however,
this underreporting should have been consistent across neigh-
borhood subtypes, making it unlikely to significantly influ-
ence the results.38 In addition, undiagnosed cases of diabetes
could not be captured, which may have led to lower estimates
ofdiabetesincidence;however,theproportionofcasesthatare
unknown is likely to be very low because of universal access
to health care and high rates of both primary care use and dia-
betes screening in the Canadian population.39,40
Conclusions
In Ontario, Canada, higher neighborhood walkability was as-
sociated with decreased prevalence of overweight and obe-
sity and decreased incidence of diabetes between 2001 and
2012. However, the ecologic nature of these findings and the
lack of evidence that more walkable urban neighborhood de-
sign was associated with increased physical activity suggest
that further research is necessary to assess whether the ob-
served associations are causal.
