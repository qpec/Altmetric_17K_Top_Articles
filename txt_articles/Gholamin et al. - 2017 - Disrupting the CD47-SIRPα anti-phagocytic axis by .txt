 Materials and Methods 
Description of therapeutic antibody used (Hu5F9-G4). Hu5F9-G4 was constructed using 
CDR-grafting from a mouse anti-human CD47 antibody, clone 5F9. Because Hu5F9-G4 activity 
is primarily dependent on blocking the CD47-SIRPα interaction, a human IgG4 scaffold was 
selected to minimize the recruitment of Fc-dependent effector functions such as antibody-
dependent cellular cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, and complement-
dependent cytotoxicity. The mechanism of action does not require these functions, and their 
presence may increase toxicity against normal cells. Hu5F9-G4 was engineered using a human 
kappa and IgG4 isotype with a Ser228Pro substitution to reduce Fab arm exchange. Detailed 
biochemical characterization and non-human primate safety assessment was previously 
published (22). 
Primary tissue dissociation and generation of primary cell lines. Pediatric brain tumor tissue 
samples were obtained under IRB protocol ID 18672 after informed patient consent at the Lucile 
Packard Children’s Hospital (Stanford, CA) in accordance with institutional review board 
protocols. For minors, consent was obtained from a parent or guardian. Human subjects approval 
was given under IRB number: 350 (Panel: 3). Tumor pathology and diagnosis were confirmed by 
the on call institutional neuropathologist. Samples were enzymatically dissociated to single cells 
by collagenase IV (1 mg/ml) and DNase I (250 units/ml), and cells were plated in neural stem 
cell expansion medium (NSCEM) consisting of Neurobasal (-A) (Invitrogen), B27 (-A) 
(Invitrogen), human-bFGF (20 ng/ml) (Shenandoah Biotech), human-EGF (20 ng/ml) 
(Shenandoah Biotech), human recombinant LIF (Millipore) (as required), and heparin (10 
ng/ml)(28). Pediatric glioblastoma cells were plated in pediatric glioma stem cell expansion 
medium (GSCEM) consisting of Neurobasal (-A) (Invitrogen), B27 (-A) (Invitrogen), human-
 bFGF (20 ng/ml) (Shenandoah Biotech), human-EGF (20 ng/ml) (Shenandoah Biotech), human 
PDGF-AA (20 ng/ml), PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) (Shenandoah Biotech), and heparin sulfate (10 
ng/ml) (Sigma). Cells were grown for 2 passages and infected with EF1-GFP-T2A-Luciferase 
(Systems Biosciences, BLIV503MN-1), then allowed to re-form spheres. Cells were then double 
sorted for GFP and further passaged in neural stem cell medium. Human fetal brain tissue from 
gestational weeks 16 to 22 was obtained from a non-profit source (Stem Express) and dissociated 
to single cells using TryPLE (Life Technologies), then cultured in NSCEM, as described above. 
Primary human pediatric brain tumor cell lines. The primary cell lines were generated at 
Stanford University in our laboratory or kindly provided by various collaborators as detailed 
below. All tumor lines were authenticated using short tandem repeat (STR) fingerprinting at the 
following 15 loci: D3S1358, TH01, D21S11, D18S51, Penta E, D5S818, D13S317, D7S820, 
D16S539, CSF1PO, Penta D, vWA, D8S1179, TPOX, FGA, AMEL. All cultures were routinely 
tested for mycoplasma contamination. 
Pediatric glioma lines. SU_DIPGVI, SU_DIPGXIII, and JHH DIPG1 (56) were from rapid 
autopsy specimens of patients who died from diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma after receiving 
radiation and chemotherapy. SU_pGBM001 and SU_pGBM002 were derived from surgically 
resected tumor samples of pediatric patients diagnosed with glioblastoma. 
Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor lines. CHB-ATRT1 was derived from a surgical specimen 
of a tumor from the posterior fossa. SU_ATRT002 was derived from a supratentorial surgical 
specimen.  
MB lines. D283 and D425 were generously provided by Dr. Darrell Bigner (Duke University, 
Durham, NC). D425s was subcloned from the original D425 for increased growth characteristics 
and incidence of spinal metastasis. SU_MB002 cells were derived postmortem from the 
 leptomeningeal compartment of a child with metastatic, treatment-refractory (chemotherapy 
only) MB. SU_MB009 cells were derived from the primary surgical resection of a tumor in a 
child whose tumor recurred after therapy, and they have been described earlier (57). SU_MB012 
and SU_MB014 were derived from the primary surgical resection of a tumor in a child whose 
tumor recurred after therapy. MYC amplification in the SU_MB002 and D425s cells was 
confirmed with NanoString nCounter v2 Cancer CN Codeset. 
Human neural progenitor lines: Origin and maintenance. Neural progenitor line (NSC1) was 
derived from subventricular zone tissue surgically excised during a functional hemispherectomy 
in a child with refractory seizures. NSC2 was derived from human fetal brain tissue from 
gestational weeks 16 to 22. Human neural progenitor cell lines were routinely tested for multi-
potency and neurosphere self-renewal using standard protocols (28). 
GL261 mouse glioma cell line. GL261 was a kind gift from Dr. Michael Lim (Johns Hopkins 
University). The GL261 murine glioma model was established in 1970 by chemical induction 
with methylcholanthrene. Tumors generated were serially transplanted subcutaneously and 
intracranially in C57BL/6 mice. The list of primary cell lines used in this study is shown in table 
S2. 
Cell line maintenance. Primary pGBM and DIPG lines were maintained in serum-free glioma 
stem cell medium consisting of Neurobasal (-A) (Invitrogen), B27 (-A) (Invitrogen), human-
bFGF (20 ng/ml) (Shenandoah Biotech), human-EGF (20 ng/ml) (Shenandoah Biotech), human 
PDGF-AA (20 ng/ml), PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) (Shenandoah Biotech), and heparin sulfate (10 
ng/ml). All patient-derived MB primary cells were maintained in NSCEM. The subventricular 
zone-derived neural stem cells were similarly maintained in NSCEM. All patient-derived cell 
lines were authenticated using sequence-tagged site fingerprinting. Each line was evaluated for 
 its ability to fully recapitulate the tumor of origin by orthotopic transplantation into NSG mice 
and analysis of the engrafted tumors by H&E staining. 
Orthotopic transplantation of brain tumors and neural progenitor cells. Early passage 
spheres were transduced with either GFP or Td-tomato and luciferase-encoding lentivirus, 
expanded in (GSCEM), and double sorted for GFP or Td-tomato expression to obtain a >95% 
luciferase-expressing population. The selected population was expanded in (GSCEM) and 
orthotopically injected into the site of tumor resection. pHGG and ATRT cells were injected 2 
mm posterior to bregma, 2 mm lateral to midline, and 3-4 mm deep in the brain. MB, PNET, and 
DIPG cells were injected at coordinates 2 mm posterior to lambda on midline and 2 mm deep 
into 4-6-week-old NOD-SCIDγ mice. Fetal brain-derived NPCs were injected in the lateral 
hemisphere of 1 to 3-day-old pups.  
Flow cytometry analysis. Surgical brain tumor specimens were dissociated to single cells and 
stained with anti-CD47-PE. Hematopoietic and endothelial cells were gated out using a lineage 
mixture of Pacific blue conjugated anti-CD45 and anti-CD31. For analysis of MB initiating cells 
in xenografts, tumor-bearing mouse brains were dissociated to single cells. Anti-H2kb and anti- 
H2kd (Biolegend) antibodies were used to gate out mouse cells, and anti-CD15-FITC (BD 
Biosciences: Clone MMA) mAb was used to identify CD15+ human MB initiating cells. Flow 
cytometric analysis and cell sorting were performed on the BD FACS aria II (Becton Dickinson). 
Appropriate isotype and fluorescence, minus one control, were used to define the background 
gates. 
Osmotic pump implantation. To achieve continuous intraventricular CNS administration of the 
anti-CD47 antibody, osmotic pumps (Alzet Co., Model 1004; flow rate 0.11 µL/h) were loaded 
with 1.9 μg/µL of antibody (equivalent to previously established 10 mg/kg dosing) or phosphate-
 buffered saline (PBS) (control). Pumps were coupled to brain infusion kits (Alzet Co., Model 
8851) and primed overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Osmotic pumps were implanted subcutaneously 
on the dorsum, slightly caudal to the scapulae, through a 2.5 cm midline incision. Using a 
stereotaxic apparatus, brain cannulae were inserted intraventricularly per predefined coordinates 
(2 mm posterior to bregma, 0.5 mm right of midline, 1 mm deep) after removal of periosteal 
connective tissue, and secured with dental cement (Stoelting Co.). At the time of animals’ death, 
cannula patency and drug delivery were verified by comparing pump weight before and after 
implantation. 
In vivo sequential co-transplant xenograft cytotoxicity model. Human fetal-derived neural 
progenitor cells expressing Td-tomato and luciferase were injected into the lateral ventricle, 0.5 
mm lateral to midline, of neonatal NSG mouse pups at 1 to 3 days of age. Mice were followed 
with BLI to ensure engraftment and sustained expression of luciferase. Human progenitor 
engrafted mice were then injected with unlabeled human MB cells (SU_MB002) at 1.5 months 
of age. SU_MB002 was previously confirmed (58) to have 100% penetrance in multiple cohorts. 
14 d after tumor cell transplantation, the mice were randomized based on BLI values and treated 
with either Hu5F9-G4 or PBS. Human neural cell viability and proliferation were measured 
through subsequent BLI. 
Immunohistochemistry. Expression of CD47 protein on primary tumor samples was evaluated 
on 4-μm thick OCT embedded fresh frozen tissue sections. Sections were fixed with acetone, 
blocked with 5% goat serum, and incubated with anti-CD47 antibody (0.2 μg/ml, Abcam 
ab3283) followed by goat anti-mouse Alexa488 (Invitrogen) secondary antibody and counter-
stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The sections were mounted, and the imaging 
was done on a fluorescent microscope (Leica). Orthotopic tumor-bearing mouse brains were 
 fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin, and 8 μm sections were cut to reveal either coronal 
or sagittal views of the brains. Tissue sections were processed for standard H&E staining or for 
mouse macrophage markers using the anti-F4/80 (Abcam) antibody. The images were taken with 
a Nikon E1000M microscope with a Spot Flex camera. 
In vitro phagocytosis assay. In vitro phagocytosis assay was performed as described before (10) 
with both human and mouse macrophages analyzed by either FACS or microscopy. To obtain 
human monocytes, PBMCs collected from venous blood of healthy volunteers were separated on 
a Ficoll density gradient (GE Healthcare). CD14+ monocytes were positively selected to >95% 
purity by MACS using anti-CD14 microbeads (Miltenyi), then plated at 1 x 106/ml in 150 x 25 
mm tissue culture plates in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, glutamine, and 
HEPES. To generate monocyte-derived macrophages, monocytes were treated for 7 d with 
human recombinant M-CSF (25 ng/mL). Mouse macrophages were obtained from mouse bone 
marrow after 7 d of bone marrow cell plating with mouse colony stimulating factor. 
For phagocytosis assays carried out by fluorescence microscopy, macrophages were stained with 
PKH26 (Sigma-Aldrich), and dissociated tumor cells were labeled with 2.5 μM 
carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CSFE) according to the manufacturer's description. Cells 
were co-incubated at a 1:2 ratio (macrophages:tumor cells) along with indicated antibodies (10 
μg/ml) or human IgG controls and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Wells were repeatedly washed to 
remove non-phagocytosed cells and subsequently imaged with an inverted microscope (Leica 
DMI6000B). The phagocytic index was calculated as the number of macrophages that had 
phagocytosed tumor cells per 100 macrophages. For FACS-based phagocytosis assay, CFSE 
labeled tumor cells were incubated with indicated antibodies (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C 
before co-incubation with macrophages. Adherent macrophages were collected using TrypLE 
 Express (Life Technologies) and incubated in serum-free medium. 5 x 104 macrophages were 
added to 1 x 105 CFSE-labeled live tumor cells per well for 4 h and returned to the incubator. 
Analysis was carried out by flow cytometry. Human macrophages were identified using anti-
human CD11b-Alexa647 and anti-human CD14- APC/Cy7 (BioLegend). Phagocytosis assays 
for each tumor type were performed in triplicates and repeated at least two times. 
Sorting of macrophage populations during phagocytosis. Macrophages (count 500,000) were 
incubated with MB cells (2 million) labeled with Calcein-AM (Life Technologies) in the 
presence of Hu5F9-G4 for 2 h. The population that was positive for macrophages (identified 
using anti-CD14 and anti-CD11b antibodies) and MB cells (identified with Calcein) was sorted, 
cytospun onto slides, stained with modified Wright-Giemsa Stain (Sigma-Aldrich) according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions, and imaged with light microscopy. 
Collection of cerebrospinal fluid. CSF sampling was performed from the cisterna magna, 
located between the cerebellum and dorsal surface of the spinal cord. The mouse was shaved in 
the neck area, anesthetized with isoflurane, and placed in a stereotaxic frame. A midline sagittal 
incision was made inferior to the occiput. The pyramid muscles were separated using blunt 
forceps. To get proper access to dura mater of the cisterna magna, the mouse head was 
repositioned making a 135-degree angle with the body. Subsequently, the dura mater of cisterna 
magna was punctured using a glass capillary. Five to ten microliters of clean CSF sample was 
drained from the cisterna magna. Samples testing positive for blood serum albumin or 
hemoglobin were discarded from analysis. 
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for testing Hu5F9-G4 levels in blood and 
CSF. Ninety-six-well plates (Costar, 9018) were coated with huCD47/mFc at a concentration of 
1 µg/ml in PBS and incubated at 4 °C overnight. After the plates were blocked for 1 h with 0.4% 
 bovine serum albumin in PBS at room temperature, mouse serum and CSF samples were added 
in four sequential dilutions. The plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Ten 
micrograms/ml biotin-labeled mouse 5F9 was added to the wells in the presence of various 
concentrations of unlabeled Hu5F9-G4, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 
h. After three successive washing steps, the plates were then incubated with HRP conjugated 
goat anti-human kappa-specific antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were developed 
with OPT. The reaction was stopped with 2M H2SO4, and the results were recorded as optical 
density units at 490 nM. GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Inc.) was used to analyze the data. 
Mice. NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) and C57/BL6 mice were housed in specific 
pathogen-free conditions at a barrier facility at the Lokey Stem Cell Building at Stanford School 
of Medicine (Stanford, CA). All animal handling, surveillance, and experimentation were 
performed in accordance with and approval from the Stanford University Administrative Panel 
on Laboratory Animal Care (Protocol # 26548 and 26209). 
Tumor tissue dissociation. Tumor samples were enzymatically dissociated by collagenase IV (1 
mg/ml) in dissociation solution containing HBSS with calcium/magnesium (Cellgro), non- 
essential amino acids (Cellgro), sodium pyruvate (Cellgro), sodium bicarbonate (Cellgro), 
HEPES (25 mM) (Cellgro), 1X Glutamax-1 (Cellgro), 1X antibiotic antimycotic (Cellgro), 
DNase, and collagenase IV (Worthington) at 37 °C. The suspension was washed 2 times with 
HBSS and filtered using 100 μm and 40 μm filters, respectively. The cells were resuspended in 
0.9 M sucrose gradient solution in HBSS without Ca/Mg (Cellgro) to remove debris and dead 
cells. The cells were treated with ACK/RBC lysis buffer (Gibco), washed twice in PBS, and 
were then ready to use. For neurosphere formation, single tumor cells were plated in tumor-stem 
medium (TSM) consisting of Neurobasal (-A) (Invitrogen), B27 (-A) (Invitrogen), human-bFGF 
 (20 ng/ml) (Shenandoah Biotech), human-EGF (20 ng/ml) (Shenandoah Biotech), human 
recombinant LIF (Millipore), and heparin (10 ng/ml). Early passage spheres were transduced 
with either GFP or Td-tomato luciferase encoding lentivirus and expanded in TSM. After 
secondary tumor sphere formation, the GFP or Td-tomato-positive cells were double sorted to 
obtain a pure population. The selected population was expanded in TSM medium and then 
injected intracranially into 5-6-week-old NSG mice using the stereotaxic frame.

Materials and Methods. Calcein AM-labeled tumor cells and macrophages were co-incubated in 
the presence of Hu5F9-G4 or IgG control. After an incubation period, cells were stained with 
anti-CD14 and anti-CD11b antibodies and analyzed on a flow cytometer. Macrophages were 
distinguished from tumor cells as being CD14+CD11b+. Macrophages with engulfed tumor cells

Schematic illustration of experimental design. (B-F) MB xenografts were treated with either 
control or Hu5F9G4 for 10 d, and the macrophage population in the tumor area was quantitated 
by flow cytometry. GFP and luciferase-expressing MB cells were orthotopically implanted in 
NSG mice. After 10 d of treatment with either control or Hu5F9-G4, the brains were dissected 
and a sagittal midline section was made. The sagittal sections were visualized under a fluorescent 
stereomicroscope. GFP fluorescence revealed large primary tumors and leptomeningeal tumor 
spread in the control brain (B), whereas only localized tumor was observed at the primary 
 cerebellar site with minimal residual leptomeningeal disease in the brain treated with Hu5F9-G4 
(scale bars, 5 mm) (D). The GFP-expressing tumors were microdissected and dissociated for 
flow cytometric analysis. GFP+ tumor cells were gated out.  Within the GFP- (mouse) cells, a

Fig. S10. Stability of Hu5F9-G4. The stability of Hu5F9-G4 was studied by visual inspection, 
pH measurement, osmolality measurement, absorbance spectrophotometry, SDS-PAGE gel, 
weak cation exchange HPLC (WCX-HPLC), and size-exclusion HPLC (SE-HPLC). Hu5F9-G4 
was stable for at least 2 months when stored at -70°C, 2-8°C and ambient temperature.

WST-1 assay for evaluation of neural progenitor cell viability after Hu5F9-G4 treatment at 
different concentrations after 24 h (left panel) and 120 h (right panel). Each colored line 
represents a different neural progenitor cell line derived from a different fetal specimen. (B) 
Phagocytosis of differentiated neural cells (neurons and astrocytes) and medulloblastoma cells 
co-cultured with macrophages and treated with either Hu5F9-G4 or PBS. No significant change 
was observed in phagocytosis of neurons and astrocytes treated with Hu5F9-G4 compared with 
their control counterparts, whereas medulloblastoma (P<0.001) and pGBM (P<0.001) cells 
treated with Hu5F9-G4 show significant engulfment by macrophages in the same experiment.

macrophages in an immunocompetent setting. (A-F) shRNA-dependent CD47 knockdown in 
GL261 cells slows down tumor growth in vivo. Analysis of cell surface expression of CD47 in 
control and CD47 knocked down GL261 by flow cytometry (A). Western blot analysis for total 
CD47 protein in GL261:CD47-KD cells and control. (B) Study design timeline (C) for mice 
orthotopically injected with either vehicle or CD47 knocked-down cells, and follow up BLI 15 
days after tumor injection (shown in D and quantified in E).  Significant extension in survival is 
seen in mice engrafted with CD47 knocked-down GL261 cell compared to control group (n= 7 
per group, P=0.0002, log-rank analysis) (F). Immunohistochemical staining with F4/80 antibody 
 showed a notable macrophage presence in tumor tissues from knocked-down CD47 GL261 cells 
compared to control group (G).

 Movie legends: 
Movie S1. Qualitative behavioral assessment of SU_MB002 tumor-bearing mice treated 
with Hu5F9-G4 compared to control. SU_MB002 cells were transplanted into the cerebellum 
of NSG mice. Tumor engraftment was verified by bioluminescence (BLI) imaging and treated 
for 20 days with either Hu5F9-G4 or control. Mice treated with Hu5F9-G4 (right cage) 
maintained weight had normal feeding behavior and showed normal exploratory behavior. Mice 
in control group (left cage) exhibited cachexia, hunched back and decreased activity. 
 
Movie S2. Qualitative behavioral assessment of D425s tumor-bearing mice treated with 
Hu5F9-G4 compared to control. D425s cells were transplanted into the cerebellum of NSG 
mice. Tumor engraftment was verified by bioluminescence (BLI) imaging and treated for 20 
days with either Hu5F9-G4 or control. Mice treated with Hu5F9-G4 (left cage) maintained 
weight, had normal feeding behavior and showed normal exploratory behavior, whereas mice in 
control group (right cage) exhibited cachexia, hunched back, diminished eating and decreased 
activity.
