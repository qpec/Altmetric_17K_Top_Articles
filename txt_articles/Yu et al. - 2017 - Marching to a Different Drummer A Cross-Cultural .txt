Purpose: Little is known about how gender norms regulate adolescents’ lives across different
cultural settings. This study aims to illustrate what is considered as violating gender norms for
boys and girls in four urban poor sites as well as the consequences that follow the challenging of
gender norms.
Methods: Data were collected as part of the Global Early Adolescent Study, a 15-country collab-
oration to explore gender norms and health in early adolescence. The current study analyzed
narrative and in-depth interviews conducted in urban poor sites in two middle-income (Shanghai,
China; and New Delhi, India) and two high-income countries (Baltimore, U.S.; and Ghent, Belgium).
A total of 238 participants, 59 boys and 70 girls aged 11e13 years old and 109 of their parents/
guardians (28 male adults and 81 female adults), were interviewed. A thematic analysis was
conducted across sites using Atlas.Ti 7.5 software.
Results: Findings revealed that although most perceptions and expressions about gender were
regulated by stereotypical norms, there was a growing acceptability for girls to wear boyish clothes
and engage in stereotypical masculine activities such as playing soccer/football. However, there
was no comparable acceptance of boys engaging in traditional feminine behaviors. Across all sites,
challenging gender norms was often found to lead to verbal, physical, and/or psychological
retribution.
IMPLICATIONS AND
CONTRIBUTION
The
current
study
uniquely illustrates how
young adolescents across
different cultural settings
challenge
stereotypical
gender
norms
through
various
approaches.
The
adverse consequences of
challenging gender norms
call for researchers, pro-
gram implementers, and
clinicians working in the
field of adolescent health
to
create
more
gender
inclusive environments.

 Conclusions: Whileitissometimes acceptable foryoungadolescents to cross gender boundaries, once
it becomes clear that a behavior is socially defined as typical for the other sex, and the adolescent will
face more resistance. Researchers, programmers, and clinicians working in the field of adolescent
health need not only attend to those who are facing the consequences of challenging prevailing gender
norms, but also to address the environment that fosters exclusion and underscores differences.

Gender
norms
are
often
defined
as
culturally
shared
expectations about the characteristics that men and women
should possess and how they ought to behave [1]. These
norms are among the strongest social factors influencing
an
individual’s
gender-related
attitudes,
beliefs,
and
behaviors [2].
Feminist scholars have critiqued the view of gender as a
binary
construct
(e.g.,
man/woman,
masculine/feminine),
pointing to the multidimensional and complex nature of gender
[3e6]. For example, Connell [7,8] described how multiple mas-
culinities and femininities exists within any given culture and
identified one dominant hegemonic masculinity characterized
by sterotypically masculine men’s power over women as well as
over other masculinities. Schippers [9] later elaborated a similar
concept of hegemonic femininity and other more marginalized
femininities to highlight devalued and complementary rela-
tionship of femininity to the dominant masculinity. This hier-
archal relationship between the varieties in femininities and
masculinities describes an interlocking set of social and cultural
practices and norms that work in tandem to organize and
regulate gender-appropriate emotional expressions, behaviors,
and sexualities [10].
While
the
formation
of
individual
perceptions
about
gender norms begin in the first decade of life [11], early
adolescence (ages 10e14 years) is a period when such atti-
tudes,
while
still
malleable,
become
more
solidifiedda
construct Hill and Lynch refer to as the Gender Intensification
Hypothesis [12,13]. During this period of time, young adoles-
cents become increasingly aware of what is expected of them
as men and women and as they face increasing pressures to
conform to what are viewed as “appropriate” gender norms
[14]. Such pressures may have negative implications for young
adolescents’ psychological adjustment [2,15]. However, young
adolescents are not just passive recipients of pressures to
conform to gender norms; rather, they are actively engaged
with shaping and changing gender norms as they endorse,
resist, or alter them in a variety of contexts, from interper-
sonal to institutional [16e18].
To date, most research on gender norms in adolescence
has
taken
place
in
high-income
countries
[8,10,14].
For
example, a recent systematic review of gender attitudes in
early adolescence
found
that
90%
of
all
published
peer-
reviewed studies were conducted in the U.S., Great Britain,
or other Western countries [19]. Little is known about gender
attitudes
among
young
adolescents
in
low-
and
middle-
income countries.
The present study aims to: (1) explore how young adolescent
boys and girls in four different cultural settings challenge gender
norms and the possible consequences of such resistances; and
(2) explore cross-cultural similarities and differences in gender
norm challenging and the social consequences for young
adolescents.
Methods
Participants
Data were collected as part of the Global Early Adolescent
Study in which narrative and in-depth interviews were con-
ducted with approximately 30 dyads of young adolescents
aged between 11 and 13 years and their parent or guardian in
urban poor sites across 15 different countries (see the paper by
Mmari et al. in this supplement). For the current study, we used
data from four of the sites in two middle-income countries
(Shanghai, China; and New Delhi, India) and two high-income
countries (Baltimore, U.S.; and Ghent, Belgium). A total of 129
young adolescents (59 boys and 70 girls) and 109 of their par-
ents/guardians (28 male adults and 81 female adults, of whom 3
were guardians) were interviewed. A detailed description of the
respondents is shown in Table 1.
Procedure and protocol
All four sites used a similar approach to recruit participants
and conduct activities from June to May 2015. Participants
were
either
recruited
via
community-based
organizations,
school-related programs, or key informants working with ad-
olescents. In Baltimore, participants were recruited through
after-school program providers and churches. In Ghent, re-
spondents
were
recruited
through
(health)
organizations
working with adults and adolescents in low-income neigh-
borhoods and a school. In New Delhi, a house-listing exercise
was conducted to identify adolescents aged 11e13 years from
the selected neighborhood. Subsequently, trained researchers
invited the parent/guardian of eligible adolescents to partici-
pate in the study. In Shanghai, participants were recruited via
community-based organizations, where parent/guardian-child
pairs were screened first by community informants for their
eligibility to participate in the study. On participants’ arrival for
the interview, the study procedures were explained to them
again by local researchers.
Consent
procedures
were
standardized
across
sites
by
obtaining written parental/guardian consent and an adolescent
assent. All research protocols were approved by the World
Health Organization’s Ethical Review Board, the Johns Hopkins
Bloomberg School of Public Health Institutional Review Board
(IRB), and institutional approval by each site’s IRB committee.
At each site, several forms of data collection occurred [20]. In
the current study, we used data from individual narrative
interviews [21] with young adolescents and in-depth interviews
with their parent/guardian (see Mmari et al. in this supplement
for detailed description of the methodology). Each interview was
audio recorded, transcribed, and where needed translated into
English [20]. All translations were spot checked by research
assistants or site coordinators.

 Analytical strategy
A thematic analysis was conducted, focusing on young ado-
lescents’ narratives about the violation and challenging of gender
norms as well as parent/guardians’ perceptions about how boys
and girls learn what is expected of young men/women in their
respective societies. In the first step of the analysis, line-by-line
open coding within each site [22] was completed, followed by
cross-site analysis to identify core categories and subcategories
as well as site-specific ones. Core categories related to “rejecting
norms” by either adolescents or their parents/guardians were
extracted. Next, these categories were compared and contrasted
across sites to generate common themes related to the expres-
sion and consequences of challenging gender norms.
Results
Perceptions about what it means to challenge gender norms
Across sites, young adolescents expressed similar perceptions
about gender norms and what it means to challenge such norms
(Table 2).
In Baltimore, Ghent, and Shanghai, challenging gender norms
for boys included not liking sports, wearing girl stuff, and nail
polish, while doing household chores were described as not
manly in Baltimore and Delhi. Girls who participated in certain
sports (e.g., soccer) were considered by some respondents to be
acting like a man (Shanghai) and to be not feminine (Ghent). For
girls, challenging gender norms was also characterized by dres-
sing in boyish clothes (e.g., pants), having short hair, engaging in
violence or fighting, and playing American football (in U.S., when
participants refer to football, they meant American football,
while in other two sites (Ghent and Shanghai), they were refer-
ring to soccer) or soccer (Baltimore, Ghent and Shanghai), and
the avoidance of house chores to play with boys (New Delhi). A
girl from Delhi talked about how she was treated by her mom for
not doing the house chores assigned to her:
[Yesterday night] I was supposed to fill water but I get very
tired by filling water, but my mother says that it’s your work
you should finish it and not to do useless things. I went to
circus and did not complete any of my work. When I came
back I was beaten badly by my mother.
Clothing was also singled out as a marker of gender-appropriate
public presentation for both boys and girls. Specifically, across
sites, there were clear reflections as to what gender-appropriate
clothing is, for example, that boys are supposed to wear sport
clothes, while girls should wear skirts, dresses, and so.

 Challenging gender norms
Below, we elaborate on three commonly referenced themes of
challenging gender norms across sites: boys wearing nail polish,
girls
playing
football/soccer,
and
gender
“inappropriate”
clothing. These behaviors signify violation of, respectively,
proper gender behavior and proper gender comportment or
“performance” [23,24].
Boys wearing nail polish
In Baltimore, Ghent, and Shanghai, boys who wore nail polish
were considered to challenge gender norms since this was
viewed as a girl’s thing. For example, an 11-year-old girl from
Baltimore reported that she would never “Get my nails done.
And get our hair done” with her brothers because “they are
boys.” She went on to indicate that when they were children,
they used to do these activities together but now that they are
adolescents it is inappropriate. She further elaborated that the
only condition that boys would do this is if “they are gay, and my
brother is not gay.” A similar conclusion echoed from a narrative
of an 11-year-old Ghent boy, who also told a story about what it
meant to be a “real man”:
.uh, a man can also have something feminine, but if you
want to be a real man.That you have to adapt with those
things, with your clothing and stuff. And also play soccer and
stuff, well yeah, or not like put on make-up and like mascara
and paint your nails. Then you’re not a boy.
Nail polishing was such a clear marker of femininity that
violation of this norm had consequences, as one college-
educated mother in Shanghai described:
I have a good friend. His son is five years old. .When he saw
his mother lipsticks and nail polish, he would cry for them.
[laughs] Then he put nail polish on his toenails, and he came
to my home to play. There were a few older boys [10e to
13 years] .and when adults were out, they were playing at
home. They took off shoes, jumped in my bed. Suddenly they
saw his nail polish. Then they made fun of him. My son said,
you are not a boy, because you have the nail polish. Then
another said, if you agree that he is not a boy, raise your hand.
Then all the children raised their hands. Then he said, “Take
off pants to prove that you are not a girl.” . When he [the boy
who polished his toe-nails] went home he asked mom to
remove all the nail polish. Then he did not touch anything that
belonged to his mother. He told his mom, I am a boy, a man,
and cannot touch girl’s things.
Clearly, wearing nail polish was such a threat to masculinity
norms that even at the age of 5 years, peer pressure was suffi-
ciently strong for the child to hear that if he were to be consid-
ered a boy, he should never do it again. And while for the 5-year
old, it was not seen as a big deal, it clearly was for his adolescent
male neighbors.
Girls playing football/soccer
While wearing nail polish has traditionally been viewed as an
expression of femininity, playing soccer (football) has tradition-
ally been viewed as a “boy thing.” Interestingly, however, it
appears that in some cultures, this is changing. For example, in
Ghent, some male participants acknowledged that norms around
soccer are changing:
“Girls are hundred percent [as involved as] boys in football.
[Today] there are more girls playing football than boys.
(13 year old boy)”
Elsewhere soccer was seen as predominantly a male activity
and comments centered on the requirements of strength, fear-
lessness, and indifference to pain. As an 11-year-old Chinese boy
made his point of a girl being very strong and not feeling hurt
when he kicked the ball on her. While in Baltimore, where
American football is popular among males, a boy aged 11 years
old said:
[I]f you [girls] play girl football like if you play boy football,
they are going to tackle you anyway, they are just going to
tackle you, at my school.
Not surprisingly, there were girls recognized as expressing
both masculine and feminine characteristics across sites. In
Baltimore, a mom talked about her daughter as being a tom girl
[boy] as she engaged in both stereotypically feminine expres-
sions like wearing makeup, nail polish, and doing her hair but
also rejecting the stereotype: “.she just don’t want to be girly,
like she is a tom girl[boy].” In Belgium, some informants noted
that the fact that a girl is good at soccer “doesn’t mean she is a
boy.” A similar duality was seen in Shanghai where, for example,
one girl talked about liking shiny accessories and pink tops but
also used the phrase tomboy referring to her participating in
more stereotypical masculine behaviors like running and jump-
ing with boys.
Clothing
As was true for gender norms about sports, perceptions about
norms related to clothing appeared to be changing in many
places, but again, these changes were more apparent among girls
than boys in this study. For example, in many of the sites, ste-
reotypically masculine clothing like pants was considered as
something that can be worn by both boys and girls. However, as
an 11-year-old boy from Shanghai noted girls can wear both
skirts and pants, but boys can only wear pants. The same notion
was heard in Baltimore from a boy about the same age who said
that it did not matter so much what boys did, but they need to
dress right suggesting that boys could not dress in stereotypical
feminine clothing such as skirts.
Furthermore, clothing played a clear role in marking the
transitions into adolescence. In Delhi, for example, a 12-year-old
female participant talked about the expectation that as they
become adolescents, tank tops, short skirts, and jeans are not
supposed to be worn, but rather, they should wear the salwar
(traditional Indian dress):
. There was a girl in our class in Mithapur School [near the
slum], who used to wear short skirts [knee length]. In name of
going to toilet she went to the ground and started playing
with boys. When ma’am (teacher) came to know about it she
scolded her for wearing short skirt in school. After the school
got over, she was sitting alone when a boy went inside the
school and raped her as she was wearing short skirt.
In Ghent, respondents mentioned how girls need to be careful
in selecting their clothing; otherwise, they could be considered
as “too easy” or “prostitutes” and become victims of violence.
C. Yu et al. / Journal of Adolescent Health 61 (2017) S48eS54
S51
 Conversely, not wearing skirts “like other girls” in other contexts
was viewed as challenging gender norms. As one Shanghainese
13-year-old boy noted about a girl he knew: “she cut short hair
and she never wears a skirt, just wears [pants] like the boy.
Others regard her as a tomboy.”
Consequences of challenging gender norms
The consequences of challenging stereotypical gender norms
varied across sites. In some settings, going against stereotypes
was considered less of an issue. For example, in Belgium, knitting
was generally not considered as a normative expression of
masculinity, and yet, boys who did so were still considered
among the most popular boys in the class. In Baltimore and
Ghent, some young adolescents expressed high tolerance for
nonstereotypical attire; I.don’t care, like, I mean, it is your life
you can do whatever you want. Another said: That’s his choice. I
wouldn’t say a thing. In Shanghai, girls who challenge norms by
wearing boys’ clothes were seen by some as not strange but
handsome.
That said, tolerance for atypical or what was viewed as cross
gender attire was not the rule. Rather, negative consequences
were still common across all four sites, including being physically
bullied, teased, or blamed of rejecting norms. Parentsdat least in
Shanghaidtalked about the mental health consequences of
those who face such rejections. Boys who challenge gender
norms by their dress or behavior were by many respondents seen
as socially inferior: Boys who are not like boys will be laughed at
by other boys, be despised or talked about, or be called names
like gay or faggot (Baltimore, Ghent), or sissy or weirdo
(Shanghai).
The same, however, was less true for girls whose appearance
(e.g., wearing pants) or behavior (e.g., playing soccer/American
football) was seen as masculine. They were more likely to be
labeled “tomboy” than pejorative names. While it was less
common that girls were called names, peers, and parents
commonly admonished them and had their behavior and dress
“corrected.” When girls were called names, it was usually
because of their attire being viewed as sexual, using names such
as slut. In Delhi and Belgium, the consequences for girls of being
seen as wearing “provocative clothing” putting them at risk of
sexual violence becausedas is seen elsewhere in this volumed
boys were viewed as not being in control of their sexual urges.
Likewise, as young adolescent girls playing with boys was seen as
provocative and inappropriate. As one girl from Delhi noted:
I was forbidden [by my mom] from playing with boys,
moreover people would accuse my family saying that your
daughter is disobedient. If she was good, then she would have
stayed in the house rather than going out and playing with
boys.
Discussion
In this paper, we compared how boys and girls across four
sites in Asia, Europe, and North America challenge gender norms
and the associated consequences. We identified three behaviors
reflecting gender comportment or performance, each tradition-
ally associated with one or another sex, which were especially
characteristic of challenging norms: boys wearing nail polish,
girls
playing
soccer/football,
and
violations
of
gender-
appropriate clothing. We saw some striking similarities and
some important differences across sites in terms of how young
adolescents challenged these norms, and the consequences that
they faced when doing so. For example, we saw a growing
acceptability in a number of settings for girls to wear boyish
clothes and engage in masculine activities. However, there was
no comparable acceptance of boys engaging in stereotypical
feminine behaviors such as wearing nail polish or dresses.
Clothing was a clear public statement of gender, and in
different settings, the same clothing carried with it different
connotations. Wearing skirts was considered as a female gender
expression and not wearing it was a way of challenging gender
norms in Shanghai, while similar dressing in New Delhi was seen
as inappropriate for adolescent girls and even sexually provoc-
ative. In Ghent, respondents also talked about how girls should
dress in a feminine way, yet not too feminine or they could risk
being considered as “easy” or “prostitutes.” Thus, similar dress
and behaviors in different cultural contexts connote different
meanings [18].
Perceptions of gender norms and consequences of chal-
lenging such norms also revealed that while it is sometimes
acceptable for young children to cross gender boundaries, once it
becomes clear that a behavior is socially defined as typical for the
other sex (which usually happens in adolescence), it is shunned
out of fear of being ostracized. In the current study, we saw this in
the examples of boys wearing nail polishing and girls wearing
short skirts. The social sanctions for certain gender norms were
strong and appeared to be consistent among young adolescents
across the different study sites. That certain gender norms (e.g.,
boys should not be feminine and girls should not be “provoca-
tive”) were more resistant to change than others (e.g., playing
certain sports) echoes findings from a World Bank review by
Boudett et al. on norms changing in 20 countries [18], as well as
findings from the Young Lives Study in Peru, India, Vietnam, and
Ethiopia [25].
What makes soccer/football interesting from a gender norms
perspective is that it appeared to be a behavior in transition from
one that once had negative sanctions for girls (like wearing nail
polish is for boys) to one for which acceptability is increasing. In
fact, it appears that tomboys (girls) are granted more peer and
parental acceptance than their male sissy counterparts, who
appear to face significantly more stigma and rejection. This is in
line with findings from the 2016 systematic review cited earlier,
which showed that while many young adolescents in different
cultural settings commonly challenge gender norms, it was more
common among girls, as boys appeared to face more cultural
stigma when doing so [19]. A potential explanation for this may
be that girls who “act like boys” display masculine characteristics
associated with power and dominance, while conversely boys
who “act like girls” are generally not granted the same social
acceptance because of the lower power or prestige associated
with femininity traits and behaviors (e.g., gentleness, softness)
[26]. Interestingly, conversations and efforts to increase gender
equity or gender equality often refer to the need for girls and
women to become more like boys and men than the other way
around (see, e.g., Sheryl Sandberg’s Lean In) [27]. It has been
acknowledged by literature that promoting and privileging
masculine traits (e.g., violence, risk-taking, substance use) may
bring negative health and social consequences to both boys and
girls [28,29]. Previous studies have shown how young men may
face peer pressure to engage in unprotected sexual relationship
in order to prove their manliness and sexual prowess [30e32].
Additionally, the emphasis of masculine traits may bring
C. Yu et al. / Journal of Adolescent Health 61 (2017) S48eS54
S52
 negative consequences for women and girls as well by imposing
a double burden that expects them to be competitive and suc-
cessful in terms of education and labor while still carrying the
main responsibility for domestic duties and care taking [25].
Limitations
Several limitations of the current study need to be noted.
First, given the purposive sample and qualitative nature of the
study, adolescent participants are not representative of all young
people from the study sites or countries. Moreover, few partici-
pants noted that they themselves or their children have experi-
ences of challenging of gender norms; they merely refereed to
what happens when other people do so. Deeper investigations of
individual experiences of challenging norms are therefore
needed. Additionally, as is always the case in qualitative analyses,
the coding of what was considered as challenging gender norms
was from the perspectives of the data analysts. That said, the data
analysts represented a range of disciplines and cultural/linguistic
perspectives. Finally, all data were cross-sectional so conclusions
of causality or social trends cannot be deduced. Longitudinal
studies are needed to assess to what direction and to what extent
femininity and masculinity norms, in different cultural settings
and through other agents such as parents, peers, or media, in-
fluence adolescent health.
The current study showed that while stereotypical gender
norms prevail, such norms are challenged by young adolescents
in different cultural settings in various ways. These findings
reflect that gender is constructed through socialization and that
gender attitudes and norms during the early adolescent period
are
amenable
to
change.
Findings
further
highlight
the
complexity of gender norms across different cultural settings;
violations of similar gender norms bring different consequences
in different sites.
Our findings suggest that researchers working in the field of
adolescent health should not only pay attention to those who are
bullied or teased because of their violation of stereotypical
gender norms, but also work to help young people recognize and
transform harmful stereotypical gender norms so as to create a
more gender equal society. A study found that sexuality and HIV
education programs that address gender and power in intimate
relationships are five times more likely to be effective than
programs that do not [33]. Since early adolescence is a period
where perceptions of gender norms may be more amenable to
change compared to later adolescence, interventions, such as It’s
All One Program created by Population Council [34] and the Save
the Children’s CHOICES curriculum [35] which have proven
successful for transforming gender attitudes, are needed to
create equal gender norms and challenge harmful masculinity
and femininity stereotypes.
