IMPORTANCE The efficacy of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is well demonstrated in
clinical trials in which NRT is accompanied by behavioral support. Epidemiologic data,
however, indicate that people using NRT are no more likely to successfully quit smoking than
those who do not use NRT.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of mailing nicotine patches to smokers without behavioral
support on quit success rates.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A single-blinded, 2-group randomized clinical trial of
adult smokers recruited across Canada by random-digit dialing of home and cell telephone
numbers from June 4, 2012, through June 26, 2014. Follow-up was completed on January 5,
2015, and data were analyzed from May 24, 2015, through July 6, 2015. A total of 2093
individuals who smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day were interviewed at baseline and
asked if they would be hypothetically interested in receiving nicotine patches by mail to quit
smoking. Those who were interested and deemed eligible to participate (no contraindications
to NRT) were randomized to the experimental group to be mailed a 5-week supply of nicotine
patches or to a control group. Telephone follow-ups were conducted at 8 weeks and
6 months.
INTERVENTIONS Participants in the experimental group were sent a 5-week course of
nicotine patches by expedited postal mail (3 weeks of step 1 [21 mg of nicotine], 1 week of
step 2 [14 mg of nicotine], 1 week of step 3 [7 mg of nicotine], no behavioral support
provided). Participants randomized to the control group were not offered the nicotine
patches or any other intervention.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was 30-day smoking abstinence at
6 months.
RESULTS Of the 2093 participants who were interviewed as part of the baseline survey
(76.5% response rate), 1000 were found eligible for the trial and randomized to a group.
Analyses were conducted on 500 participants in the experimental group (mean [SD] age,
48.0 [12.8] years; 255 female [51.0%]) and 499 in the control group (mean [SD] age, 49.7
[12.7] years; 256 female [51.3%]). Self-reported abstinence rates were significantly higher
among participants who were sent nicotine patches compared with the control group
(30-day abstinence: 38 [7.6%] of 500 vs 15 [3.0%] of 499; odds ratio, 2.65; 95% CI,
1.44-4.89; P = .002). Usable saliva samples were returned by only 50.9% of the participants.
Biochemically validated abstinence at 6 months was found in 14 (2.8%) of 500 participants in
the experimental group vs 5 (1.0%) of 499 in the control group (odds ratio, 2.85; 95% CI,
1.02-7.96; P = .046).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The trial provides evidence of the effectiveness of mailed
nicotine patches without behavioral support to promote tobacco cessation. The strength of
these findings is tempered by the lack of biochemical validation for all participants.

S
moking remains a leading cause of preventable disease
worldwide.1 There are numerous ongoing tobacco con-
trol initiatives, of which some have had success, par-
ticularly in countries where there is support for these
initiatives.2 However, more scalable, evidence-based inter-
ventions are needed to further reduce the prevalence of to-
bacco smoking.
Provision of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is one op-
tion that has a considerable evidence base, at least in clinical
trials. In a meta-analysis of 150 trials, NRT has demonstrated
efficacy, with NRT increasing the rate of quitting smoking by
50% to 70%, irrespective of the clinical setting in which the
smoker is treated.3 However, concern over the effectiveness
of NRT in real-world settings has emerged. Population survey
data comparing those who used NRT (obtained over the coun-
ter) during a quit attempt and those who did not use NRT has
found no association between use of NRT and an increase in
success rates.4,5 Although causal statements regarding the ef-
fect of NRT cannot be made based on these population sur-
vey data, because participants were not randomized and thus
other factors could be systematically different between those
who used NRT and those who did not, these findings are trou-
bling. They point specifically to the need for randomized clini-
cal trials of the effectiveness of NRT in naturalistic settings
where there is no additional behavioral support (such as that
provided in clinical trials) to evaluate the effectiveness of NRT
as it is likely used by most people trying to quit smoking.6
A meta-analysis7 revealed that earlier trials investigating the
efficacy of over-the-counter NRT incorporated methods that
entailed between 3 and 10 visits with researchers or pharma-
cists, making it unrealistic to describe these studies as
research testing the efficacy of NRT without behavioral
support.
Another compelling reason for the conduct of such ran-
domized clinical trials is the ongoing public health initiatives
in which NRT has been distributed free of charge by mail to
those who call in to receive them. These mass distribution ini-
tiatives have been ongoing in a number of countries, with con-
siderableresourcesallocatedtotheirimplementation.8,9There
are promising results supporting these mass distribution ef-
forts in the number of current smokers responding to the ini-
tiatives and the proportion of smokers who are reporting ab-
stinence at follow-up.9-13 Furthermore, there is evidence that
the distribution of free NRT is cost-effective, with a cost of
Can$1720 per quit participant in the Canadian mass distribu-
tion initiative.9 However, data collected before and after the
implementation of these initiatives cannot allow causal state-
ments as to their effectiveness because there is no random-
ization to condition.
The current trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of
providing free NRT (in the form of the nicotine patch) by ex-
pedited postal mail without behavioral assistance to smokers
interested in receiving it. The design allowed for a random-
ized clinical trial comparing participants who were inter-
estedinreceivingnicotinepatchesandreceivedthemwithpar-
ticipants who were interested in receiving nicotine patches but
did not receive them. Those who did not receive nicotine
patches were unaware that the nicotine patches were being of-
feredtoothers,allowingforastrongtestofthehypothesis.The
primary hypothesis was that participants who were sent free
nicotine patches by mail would have a higher proportion of 30-
day abstinence at 6-month follow-up compared with partici-
pants who were not sent nicotine patches. The secondary hy-
pothesis tested the effect of receiving free nicotine patches on
7-day abstinence at 8-week follow-up.
Methods
Trial Design
We conducted a single-blinded, 2-group randomized clinical
trial comparing a control group with an experimental group
receiving nicotine patches by mail. The trial protocol can be
found in the Supplement. The research was approved by the
institutionalreviewboardattheCentreforAddictionandMen-
tal Health. The published protocol14 was approved by the in-
stitutional review board at the Centre for Addiction and Men-
tal Health before trial initiation.
Study Population and Recruitment
Participants were recruited using a general population tele-
phone survey of Canadian households, conducted from June
4, 2012, through June 26, 2014. Follow-up was completed on
January 5, 2015, and data were analyzed from May 24, 2015,
through July 6, 2015. Interviews and recruitment were con-
ducted by trained interviewers at the Survey Research Cen-
tre, University of Waterloo, using computer-assisted tele-
phone interview technology. With the use of random-digit
dialing of home and cell telephone numbers, an initial screen-
ing interview identified adult (aged ≥18 years) smokers who
smoked 10 or more cigarettes per day. Respondents were se-
lected based on the next birthday randomization method,
whereby individuals answering the telephone were asked for
an adult smoker in the household with the next birthday. In-
dividuals contacted on their cell phone were considered as in-
dividual households, and this next birthday random selec-
tion method was not used. Verbal consent to participate in the
study was obtained via telephone because this was the pri-
mary method of recruitment. All participants were informed
at baseline that they would be taking part in a longitudinal sur-
veyonsmokingandconsentedtosubmitasalivasampleateach
time point (baseline, 8 weeks, and 6 months) to examine
changes in nicotine metabolism over time. No mention was
made to participants at any time that they were taking part in
a randomized clinical trial. We wished to reduce any poten-
tial differential rates of saliva sample return by condition and
smoking status and diminish the possibility that receiving a
saliva sample kit would encourage participants to provide bi-
ased responses. Therefore, saliva sample kits were sent to all
participants at each survey time point, regardless of whether
they reported abstinence.
As part of the telephone survey and nested within a se-
ries of questions inquiring about use of, or interest in, other
tobacco cessation aids, participants were asked, “The Minis-
try of Health is considering different ways to help people stop
smoking. One option would be to provide interested smokers

with free nicotine patches. If nicotine patches were offered for
free, would you be interested in receiving them?” Those who
stated that they were interested were then asked if they would
use the patches to quit smoking, would use them within 1 week
of receiving them, and were willing to have the patches sent
to their home. Participants who said yes to all these ques-
tions,hadnocontraindicationstousingnicotinepatches(being

ing a serious heart or circulation problem, not including high
blood pressure), and had a valid home address that was not a

tine patches and saliva sample kits) were randomized. Partici-
pants who did not answer yes to these questions were ineli-

follow-up surveys.
Randomization, Masking, and Interventions
Participants eligible for the trial were randomized to the ex-
perimental or control group (Figure) using a random number
generator contained in the computer-assisted telephone in-
terview program. Randomization was conducted in blocks of
10 with a 1:1 allocation to the experimental group within each
block and with no stratification. Those in the experimental
group were told, “As part of a pilot trial, the Centre for Addic-
tion and Mental Health has a supply of nicotine patches to dis-
tribute to interested smokers. You told us that you would be
interested in receiving a free supply of nicotine patches. Do we
have your permission to mail them directly to your home?” All
who were offered the nicotine patches also consented to have
them sent to their home. They were sent a 5-week course of
nicotine patches by expedited postal mail along with a cover
letter instructing them on the use of the patches and advising
them to talk to their physician or pharmacist if they had any
further questions (no other behavioral support was pro-
vided; 3 weeks of step 1 [21 mg of nicotine], 1 week of step 2
[14 mg of nicotine], 1 week of step 3 [7 mg of nicotine]). The
5-week course was chosen because it mimicked the quantity
of nicotine patches sent in the Ontario-based mass distribu-
tioninitiativeandisinlinewiththeamountofnicotinepatches
mailed in other reports of mass distributions initiatives.8,9 Par-
ticipants randomized to the control group were told that they
wouldberecontactedatthenextfollow-upsurvey,butnomen-
tion of nicotine patches was made. All participants were fol-
lowed up at 8 weeks and 6 months by telephone. Interview-
ers were masked to the experimental group at the time the
primary outcome measures were assessed at each follow-up
(ensured through use of the computer-assisted telephone in-
terview program). The Salivette saliva sample collection kit
(Sarstedt AG & Co) was mailed with the $20 payment after the
baseline interview. One week before the 8-week and 6-month
follow-ups, participants were sent the $20 payment for the re-
spective telephone survey and the saliva sample kit. As an
added incentive for the return of saliva samples, participants
were also informed that they would receive an additional $10
on the submission of each sample.
Outcomes and Statistical Analyses
Fulldetailsofthesamplesizecalculationsandstatisticalanaly-
ses can be found in the trial protocol in the Supplement.14 In
brief, based on data from the 2008 Canadian Tobacco Use
MonitoringSurvey,15weestimatedthatabaselinesmokingces-
sation rate of 3.7% would be observed in the control group at
6 months. This estimate was consistent with another report16
of successful unassisted long-term abstinence rates of 3% to
5%.Quitratesfortheexperimentalgroupwereestimatedbased
on systematic reviews,17,18 which indicated an approximately
10% increase in tobacco cessation rates with the use of nico-
tine patches at 6-month follow-up compared with placebo. We
recognized that this estimate was probably too large for a prag-
matic randomized clinical trial of this nature; therefore, we
chose to power our trial based on the assumption that our quit
rate would be half as large (ie, a 5% increase in quit rates in the
experimental group vs the control group at 6-month follow-
up). Given these assumptions, we predicted that participants
in the experimental group would have an 8.7% quit rate at
6-month follow-up. It was determined that a sample size of
1000 participants would be needed to take part in the trial to

at a significance level of .05 and a power of 80% (taking into

nence from tobacco cigarettes, even a puff) and 8 weeks (sec-
ondary outcome: 7-day abstinence from tobacco cigarettes,
even a puff). Following the analysis plan specified in the pro-
tocol, an intent-to-treat approach was used, and participants
lost to follow-up were considered active smokers. A com-
plete case analysis is also reported, including only partici-
pantswhoprovidedfollow-updataateachtimepoint.Thepro-
tocol for this study called for abstinence to be confirmed by
biochemical validation. Despite following the postal mail sa-
liva collection protocol used in other research,19,20 a large pro-
portion of participants did not return usable saliva samples.
For example, 69.8% of participants reporting 30-day absti-
nence at the 6-month follow-up returned their saliva samples,
and 27.0% of these samples had evaporated, allowing bio-
chemical validation of only 50.9% of participants who claimed
abstinence (no significant difference; P > .05 between groups
on these factors). Furthermore, the fact that so many saliva
samples evaporated calls into question the validity of the re-
maining samples because some may have partially evapo-
rated,thusincreasingthecotinineconcentrationinthesample.
Given these limitations, both self-reported and biochemi-
cally validated outcome results are reported here. Biochemi-
cal validation of abstinence was defined as the participant hav-
ing a returned saliva sample with a cotinine concentration of
less than 15 μg/L (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply
by 5.675).21 All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS
statistical software, version 20.0 (SPSS Inc).
Results
A total of 43 785 Canadian households (including cell phones)
werecontactedfromJune4,2012,throughJune26,2014,using
random-digit dialing methods and screened for initial eligi-
bility, of which 2737 were identified as having at least 1 adult
who smoked 10 or more cigarettes per day. A total of 2093 par-
ticipants consented and were interviewed as part of the base-
line survey (76.5% response rate). Of these, 1000 were found
eligible for the trial and randomized to a group. One indi-
vidual in the control group had reported at follow-up that her
responses throughout the study had been falsely provided by
someone else in the household; therefore, after this individu-
al’
s exclusion, analyses had been conducted on 500 partici-
pants in the experimental group and 499 participants in the
control group. Follow-up rates were not significantly differ-
ent (Fisher exact test, P = .41) between groups at 8 weeks but
were significant at 6 months (P = .04). However, because par-
ticipantslosttofollow-upwerecountedascurrentsmokersand
becausethefollow-uprateintheexperimentalgroupwaslower
thaninthecontrolgroup(77.8%vs83.2%),thedifferentialrates
do not increase the chances of finding a significant difference
in cessation rates owing to the provision of NRT. The Figure
provides a CONSORT flow diagram for the trial.
Bivariate comparisons were made between participants in
the experimental and control groups on demographic and
smoking characteristics. With the exception of age (mean age,
48.0 years for the experimental group and 49.7 years for the
control group; P = .046), no significant differences were ob-
served between groups on any of the demographic or smok-
ing characteristics (P > .05; Table). Because the difference in
age was marginal and only significant because of the large
sample size, we chose not to control for age in the outcome
analyses. Separate logistic regressions were conducted to as-
sess differences in the proportion of participants reporting 30-
day abstinence at the 6-month follow-up and 7-day absti-
nence at the 8-week follow-up, using an intent-to-treat
approach.
Biochemically Validated Abstinence
Half (50.9%) of the participants had useable saliva samples for
biochemical validation. Saliva sample return rates among self-
reported abstainers did not differ significantly by group at
either the 8-week (P = .36) or 6-month (P > .99) follow-up. Par-
ticipants receiving nicotine patches were significantly more
likely to have verified abstinence at 6-month follow-up (14

the control group; odds ratio [OR], 2.85; 95% CI, 1.02-7.96;

tal group vs 4 [0.8%] of 499 in the control group; OR, 3.04; 95%
CI, 0.98-9.50; P = .06). The number needed to treat to achieve
cessation was 56 (95% CI, 29-922) for the 6-month follow-up.

vs the control group (5 [1.2%] of 415) (OR, 3.06; 95% CI, 1.09-

bers needed to treat to achieve cessation were 22 (95% CI, 14-
55) and 20 (95% CI, 13-39) for the 6-month and 8-week end
points, respectively. Complete case analyses revealed similar
findings, with self-reported abstinence rates significantly
higher among participants who were sent nicotine patches by
mail compared with the control group at 6-month (38 [9.8%]
of 389 vs 15 [3.6%] of 415; OR, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.56-5.34; P = .001)
and 8-week (37 [8.7%] of 427 vs 11 [2.5%] of 436; OR, 3.67; 95%
CI, 1.84-7.29; P < .001) follow-ups.
Use of Nicotine Patches
In the experimental group, 421 (98.6%) of all 427 partici-
pants surveyed at 8 weeks reported to have received the
nicotine patches they were sent, and 246 (58.4%) of those
421 reported to have used the nicotine patches. A total of
200 (81.3%) of all 246 nicotine patch users reported using
only some of the nicotine patches they received by 8 weeks,
whereas 46 (18.7%) of 246 had used all that were provided.
Of participants followed up at 8 weeks, 13 (3.0%) of 427 of
those in the experimental group had purchased additional
nicotine patches, compared with 30 (6.9%) of 436 in the con-
trol group (P = .01). At the 6-month follow-up, however, no
differences between groups were observed, such that 25
(6.4%) of 389 of those in the experimental group and 31
(7.5%) of 415 in the control group had purchased nicotine
patches (P = .58). Purchase of any other smoking cessation
aids (ie, nicotine gum, inhaler, bupropion, or varenicline)
similarly did not differ between groups (P = .19).
Discussion
Providing a 5-week supply of nicotine patches via mail re-
sulted in more than a doubling of 30-day abstinence quit rates
at the 6-month follow-up. Because the provision of NRT was
without behavioral assistance, the results of this trial provide
evidence of the effectiveness of nicotine patches as a tobacco
cessation aid in real-world settings.
Although a random-digit dialing method was used, the
sample should not be taken as representative of the general
population because of the multiple inclusion steps taken to re-
cruit the sample. Rather, the sample is best regarded as a di-
verse one from rural and urban settings across Canada. Fur-
thermore, the findings of the trial do not provide direct
evidence of the efficacy of mass distribution initiatives be-
cause the recruitment method for this trial was different from
that used in mass distribution initiatives (random-digit dial-
ing rather than interested participants calling a toll-free num-
ber). However, the results of the trial provide general support
for direct-to-smoker programs with free mailed nicotine
patches.
In efficacy trials of smoking cessation medications, bio-
chemical validation using exhaled carbon dioxide or coti-
nine in saliva, urine, or blood is considered the criterion
standard. However, in population-based studies, given the
large sample sizes, differential reporting biases between
groups are unlikely to invalidate the findings. Although con-
sensus statements indicate that biochemical validation of
tobacco cessation is not required in the present study,21 the
protocol for the current trial stated that biochemical valida-
tion would be conducted. Thus, the poor response rate and
the questionable reliability of the saliva samples because of
evaporation are limitations of the results and reduce confi-
dence in the validity of the findings. Although the study
design has several strengths in allowing for a test of the
effect of nicotine patches without behavioral support and
without participants in the control group being aware that
other participants were even offered nicotine patches (or
participants even being aware they were in a randomized
trial), the recruitment method and study rationale provided
to the participants likely resulted in a study population that
was not aware of the importance of returning the saliva
samples. Perhaps a larger incentive would have resulted in a
better return rate. However, this approach would not have
addressed the additional issue of evaporated saliva samples.
To partially counteract this limitation, we also provided self-
reported abstinence as an outcome measure. We suspect
that the self-reported abstinence rate is closer to the actual
abstinence rate in this study because the self-reported absti-
nence rate in the control group was similar to that reported
in other general population samples15,16 and because the
rates reported in the experimental group were similar to that
reported based on before-after data from a mass distribution
initiative in the same country.9 However, there is no way to
confirm this hypothesis. Perhaps this is a limitation that
needs to be accepted in a pragmatic trial, such as the one
described here, because the participant sample was widely
dispersed (across all of Canada) and the procedures called
for no physical contact with the participants. We conclude
that, although biochemical validation would increase confi-
dence in the results, there is sufficient evidence of the reli-
ability of self-reported tobacco cessation22-25 to warrant the
statement that the provision of nicotine patches by expe-
dited postal mail, and without behavioral support, promotes
tobacco cessation in the short term. Further research is mer-
ited to systematically replicate these findings and to estab-

lish any long-term effect of providing NRT without behav-
ioral assistance.
The absolute level of increase in 30-day abstinence rates
(3.0% in the control group to 7.6% in the experimental
group) represents a smaller increase than that observed in
clinical trials that involve nicotine patches.17,18 We believe
this is a result of recruiting a general population sample of
smokers who were not seeking tobacco cessation assistance.
Furthermore, we note that the 30-day abstinence rate in the
control group was lower than the estimate in our sample size
calculation (3.0% vs 3.7%). This outcome resulted in a sig-
nificant finding in this trial even though the absolute differ-
ence between groups was 4.6% rather than the estimated
5%. The choice of 5% for the sample size calculation did not
represent a cutoff below which the utility of mailed NRT is
diminished. Rather, it was a simple estimate of the antici-
pated effect of the intervention in the general population.
The ORs reported in this trial are larger than those observed
in clinical trials of the efficacy of NRT3 because the low ces-
sation rates seen in the control group of this general popula-
tion sample (3.0%) allowed for a significant increase in ces-
sation rates, whereas the actual increase in cessation rates
was small (4.6%).
Conclusions
Meta-analyses and population-based studies3,26 suggest that
NRT should be used for approximately 8 weeks; however, a
shorter duration as used in our study indicated an effect. Also
encouraging was that the 6-month quit rates were similar to
those observed in other NRT mass distribution initiatives that
used 5 weeks of NRT.9 Although some smokers may benefit
from receiving more NRT, mass distribution initiatives pro-
viding less NRT allow for more people to access the program
at the same cost. Research is needed to determine the opti-
mum amount of NRT to be distributed to have the greatest ef-
fect at the population level.
