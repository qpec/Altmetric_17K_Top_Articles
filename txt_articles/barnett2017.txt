Michael L. Barnett, MD, MS; Jeffrey A. Linder, MD, MPH; Cheryl R. Clark, MD, MPH; Benjamin D. Sommers, MD, PhD
IMPORTANCE National patterns of low-value and high-value care delivered to patients
without insurance or with Medicaid could inform public policy but have not been previously
examined.
OBJECTIVE To measure rates of low-value care and high-value care received by patients
without insurance or with Medicaid, compared with privately insured patients, and provided
by safety-net physicians vs non–safety-net physicians.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This multiyear cross-sectional observational study
included all patients ages 18 to 64 years from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey
(2005-2013) and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (2005-2011) eligible
for any of the 21 previously defined low-value or high-value care measures. All measures were
analyzed with multivariable logistic regression and adjusted for patient and physician
characteristics.
EXPOSURES Comparison of patients by insurance status (uninsured/Medicaid vs privately
insured) and safety-net physicians (seeing >25% uninsured/Medicaid patients) vs
non–safety-net physicians (seeing 1%-10%).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Delivery of 9 low-value or 12 high-value care measures,
based on previous research definitions, and composite measures for any high-value or
low-value care delivery during an office visit.
RESULTS Overall, 193 062 office visits were eligible for at least 1 measure. Mean (95% CI) age
for privately insured patients (n = 94 707) was 44.7 (44.5-44.9) years; patients on Medicaid
(n = 45 123), 39.8 (39.3-40.3) years; and uninsured patients (n = 19 530), 41.9 (41.5-42.4)
years. Overall, low-value and high-value care was delivered in 19.4% (95% CI, 18.5%-20.2%)
and 33.4% (95% CI, 32.4%-34.3%) of eligible encounters, respectively. Rates of low-value
and high-value care delivery were similar across insurance types for the majority of services
examined. Among Medicaid patients, adjusted rates of use were no different for 6 of 9
low-value and 9 of 12 high-value services compared with privately insured beneficiaries,
whereas among the uninsured, rates were no different for 7 of 9 low-value and 9 of 12
high-value services. Safety-net physicians provided similar care compared with
non–safety-net physicians, with no difference for 8 out of 9 low-value and for all 12 high-value
services.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Overuse of low-value care is common among patients
without insurance or with Medicaid. Rates of low-value and high-value care were similar
among physicians serving vulnerable patients and other physicians. Overuse of low-value
care is a potentially important focus for state Medicaid programs and safety-net institutions
to pursue cost savings and improved quality of health care delivery.

W
asteful spending on low-value medical services is an
important source of unnecessary health care costs.
Recently, there has been increasing scrutiny of low-
value care, in part due to the American Board of Internal Medi-
cine (ABIM) Foundation’
s Choosing Wisely campaign.1 This
campaign, combined with other professional guidelines, has
shaped the definition of low-value services, which are evolv-
ing as quality measures.2 While eliminating low-value care is
a goal for all physicians, it may be particularly important for
physicians in settings with limited financial resources.
Prior research has documented the use of several low-
value services in Medicare nationally, as well as among pri-
vatelyandpubliclyinsuredpatientsinparticularstates.2-6How-
ever, that we know of, no research to date has examined the
national prevalence of low-value care delivery among vulner-
able patients in the health care safety net, such as those with-
out insurance or with Medicaid. It is unclear whether pat-
ternsofcarefortheseservicesdifferbypatientinsurancestatus
or by the type of physician delivering care. One possibility is
thatoveruseoflow-valuecareforuninsuredpatientsandthose
with Medicaid could be driven by the types of physicians treat-
ing them, since care for these patients is disproportionately
concentrated among a small percentage of physicians.7 Alter-
natively,patientinsurancestatusmaybeamoreimportantpre-
dictor of low-value care.8 The extent to which low-value care
is common in the treatment of uninsured and Medicaid pa-
tients has important implications for whether state Medicaid
programs and safety-net physicians should focus quality im-
provement efforts on reducing rates of low-value care.
Another important policy question is the relative magni-
tude of the problems of overuse of low-value care vs under-
use of high-value care. It is possible that patients without in-
surance or with Medicaid may not receive a significant amount
of low-value care but still experience lower quality of care due
to underuse of high-value care. Therefore, both low-value and
high-value care delivery need to be included in an assess-
ment of quality of care in Medicaid.8
Our objective was to compare patterns of high-value and
low-value care among uninsured or Medicaid patients vs pri-
vately insured patients, and between physicians serving high
vs low proportions of these vulnerable patients using nation-
ally representative survey data.
Methods
Study Population and Data
We used data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Sur-
veys (NAMCS) and the outpatient department National Hos-
pital Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys (NHAMCS) adminis-
tered by the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention.9 We used data from 2005
through the most recently available year (2011 in NHAMCS and
2013 in NAMCS). The NAMCS and NHAMCS are annual, mul-
tistage probability surveys that are nationally representative
ofambulatoryphysicianvisitsintheUnitedStates.TheNAMCS
surveys visits to nonfederally employed office–based physi-
cians’practices, and NHAMCS surveys visits to hospital–
based outpatient departments (it also samples emergency de-
partments, which were excluded from our analysis). We
included visits from patients ages 18 to 64 years. Our analysis
used publicly available data and was deemed nonhuman sub-
jects research by the institutional review board at the Har-
vard T. H. Chan School of Public Health.
Study Variables
Insurance Coverage and Safety Net Physician Categorization
The 2 main exposures of interest were a patient’
s insurance at
the time of an outpatient visit and the proportion of vulner-
able patients (defined here as uninsured or having Medicaid)
seen by a physician. The survey collects information on source
of payment for each visit, generally filled out by physician of-
fice staff. Since some patients have multiple types of cover-
age, we assigned a primary insurance type to each visit based
on the following hierarchy: Medicaid, Medicare, private in-
surance, other insurance, self-pay or charity and/or no charge
(which we combined into “uninsured”), or unknown. Pa-
tients with both Medicaid and Medicare coverage were coded
as having Medicaid coverage. We chose this approach be-
cause dual-eligible patients are an important, high-risk seg-
ment of the Medicaid population.10 Our main comparisons of
interest were rates of low-value and high-value care delivery
to Medicaid or uninsured patients vs those with private insur-
ance coverage.
Then, we defined physicians as “safety-net” and “non–
safety-net” physicians based on the survey-weighted propor-
tion of visits to each physician by patients with Medicaid or
no insurance; this operationalizes the Institute of Medicine’
s
definition of safety-net physicians as those who care for a sub-
stantial share of patients without insurance or with Medicaid.11
We categorized physicians into 4 roughly equal-sized catego-
ries by the proportion of patients without insurance or with
Medicaid: 0%, 1% to 10%, 11% to 25%, and greater than 25%.
Our study analyzed the 1% to 10% group vs the greater than
25%groupastheprimarycomparisonofinterest,becausecom-
paring physicians with 0% precludes any assessment of in-
surance type (a problem also referred to as “complete lack of
overlap”).12 For simplicity, we refer from here to the 1% to 10%
Key Points
Question How often do patients with Medicaid or without
insurance receive low-value care compared with privately insured
patients; are there any differences related to the physicians
treating these patient groups?
Findings Analyses of nationally representative survey data from
2005 to 2013 show that low-value care was delivered in nearly 1 in
5 visits, with no overall difference between Medicaid or uninsured
patients vs privately insured patients. Rates of low-value care were
similar between safety-net physicians and non–safety-net
physicians.
Meaning Overuse of low-value care is just as common among
patients with Medicaid or without insurance as among privately
insured patients.

group as “non–safety-net” and the greater 25% as “safety-
net” physicians (results from the 0% group are available in the
eAppendix in the Supplement).
Low-Value and High-Value Care Measures
We used 21 previously defined low-value care or guideline-
recommended high-value care measures (detailed defini-
tionsareavailableintheeAppendixintheSupplement).Ingen-
eral, visits were eligible for a category when a patient had a
reason for visit, physician diagnosis, or chronic illness comor-
bidity coded relevant for a given quality measure. This means
that some visits for patients with chronic illness were consid-
ered eligible, even if the visit was not for that illness. For low-
value care, we identified 9 measures defined in published
guidelines and prior literature within the NAMCS and/or
NHAMCS surveys in 4 clinical scenarios: antibiotics for upper
respiratory infections (URI)13-15; advanced imaging for
sinusitis2; nonindicated screening tests in general medical ex-
aminations (GME)4,16,17; and inappropriate imaging or narcot-
ics in acute low back pain18 and uncomplicated headache
(Table 1) (eAppendix in the Supplement).19 For high-value care
measures, we selected 12 measures endorsed by quality mea-
surement guidelines or the US Preventive Services Task Force
and previously analyzed using NAMCS and/or NHAMCS data
(Table 1) (eAppendix in the Supplement). These included to-
bacco cessation and weight loss counseling; appropriate medi-
cal treatment for coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovas-
culardisease(CVD),congestiveheartfailure(CHF),depression,
and osteoporosis; anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, and
statin use for diabetes.4,17,20,21
Statistical Analysis
For each outcome, we calculated an unadjusted survey-
weighted rate stratified by patient insurance coverage or phy-
siciansafetynetstatus.Thedenominatorforeachmeasurewas
the number of visits that patients might be eligible to receive
a service, accounting for the inclusion and exclusion criteria
in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Then, for each numerator, we
identified visits in which the low-value or high-value ser-
vices was delivered and calculated each measure’
s rate of de-
livery (0%-100%).
We also generated 2 composite measures to quantify the
delivery of any low-value or high-value service. To estimate
these measures, we calculated for each visit the proportion
of high-value or low-value services delivered as the number
of services delivered (numerator) divided by the number of
services that visit was eligible for (denominator). Because
visits varied in the number of services eligible for the com-
posite, for these outcomes we multiplied visit weights by
the number of eligible low-value or high-value services
(eAppendix in the Supplement). Therefore, the rate for each
composite measure represents the rate at which low-value
or high-value care was given among all opportunities for a
measure.

To examine the independent association of health insur-
anceorsafety-netphysicianswithlow-valueorhigh-valuecare,
we estimated logistic regression models for each of the 21 low-
value and high-value care measures, including only the visits
eligible for that measure. For the 2 composite measures, the
outcome was the proportion of eligible low-value or high-
value services delivered (using fractional logistic regression),
weighted by the product of the survey weight and the num-
ber of eligible visits.22 The primary variable of interest in each
model was either an indicator for Medicaid or uninsured pa-
tients (vs patients with private coverage), or an indicator for
being seen by a safety-net physician.
All models are adjusted for year fixed effects, patient age,
sex, race/ethnicity, number of chronic illnesses, census re-
gion, rural office location, and practice setting (solo practice,
group practice, or outpatient hospital department). Models are
simultaneouslyadjustedforpatientinsurancestatusandsafety
net physician status.
In all analyses, we used robust design–based variance es-
timators to account for clustering within geographic areas or
physicians and NAMCS and/or NHAMCS survey weights to ac-
count for the survey design and survey nonresponse. Analy-
ses were performed with R version 3.3.0 (R Foundation).23,24
We report 95% CIs for each estimate, reflecting a 2-sided sig-
nificant threshold of P < .05.
Sensitivity Analyses
We tested for changes over time in rates of the composite
low-value and high-value measures from 2005 to 2011, the
years for which NAMCS and NHAMCS data were both avail-
able (eAppendix in the Supplement). We also performed
additional sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of
our findings to different definitions of insurance coverage
(eg, excluding dual-eligible Medicaid-Medicare patients
from Medicaid group), excluding the narcotic low-value
care measures, and limiting our analysis to care delivered
solely by primary care physicians (eAppendix in the Supple-
ment).
Results
Our sample included 193 062 sampled office visits from
2005 to 2013 that were eligible for at least 1 low-value or
high-value service. Compared with those with private insur-
ance, Medicaid and uninsured patients were significantly
younger, less likely to be white, and more likely to be seen
in outpatient hospital departments (Table 2). Stratifying vis-
its by physician safety-net status showed similar patterns of
demographic features (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Even
though safety-net physicians accounted for only 26% of the

total visits in our study sample, they delivered 73% of all
visits for Medicaid or uninsured patients.
Overall, low-value and high-value care was delivered in
19.4% (95% CI 18.5%-20.2%) and 33.4% (95% CI, 32.4%-
34.3%) of eligible opportunities for all patients in our sample,
respectively.
Out of 9 low-value services, 7 were not significantly dif-
ferent, and 2 inappropriate prescribing measures (narcotics
for back/neck pain and headache) were higher for Medicaid
than for privately insured patients (Table 1). Likewise, out of
12 high-value services, 9 were not significantly different for
Medicaid than for privately insured patients (Table 1). Com-
bining the measures in a composite outcome, Medicaid
patients had similar rates of low-value care compared with
the privately insured (20.6% vs 19.1% unadjusted rates,
respectively; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.11; 95% CI, 0.99-
1.25) (Table 1; Figure 1A). In contrast, overall receipt of
pooled high-value services was lower among Medicaid
patients than among the privately insured (34.1% vs 31.5%
unadjusted rates, respectively; aOR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.83-
0.94) (Table 1; Figure 1A).
Among patients without insurance, out of 9 low-value care
measures,6werenotsignificantlydifferentcomparedwithpri-
vatelyinsuredpatients,while2inappropriateprescribingmea-
sures were more likely (antibiotics for URI and narcotics for
back/neck pain), and 1 was less likely (computed tomography/

larly, there was no difference between the uninsured and pri-
vately insured for 9 of 12 high-value care measures. Pooling
across all measures, there was no overall difference in the low-
value care composite among uninsured vs privately insured
patients (20.8 vs 19.1%; aOR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.91-1.27) (Table 1;
Figure 1B), while the uninsured were more likely to receive any
high-value care services compared with the privately insured
(aOR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.28-1.61) (Figure 1B).
There were no significant differences in the delivery of any
low-valueservicesbetweensafety-netandnon–safety-netphy-
sicians (19.9% vs 19.6% in unadjusted estimates; aOR, 0.98;
95% CI, 0.85-1.14) (Table 3; Figure 2) (eTable 3 in the Supple-
ment). There was also no difference between the physician
groups for 8 of the 9 individual low-value services. Similarly,
there was no difference in high-value composite measure for
safety-net vs non–safety-net physicians (34.1% vs 34.4%; aOR,
0.97; 95% CI, 0.87-1.08) (Table 3; Figure 2).
Sensitivity Analyses
We found no significant changes over time in the composite
low-value or high-value measures for any subgroup, except for
a modest decrease in high-value care composite delivery in the
privately insured group (OR, 0.99 per year; P = .01) (eFigure 1
and 2 in the Supplement). Our main findings were essentially
unchanged under alternative insurance coverage definitions
(eTable 4 in the Supplement). Restricting our analysis to pri-
mary care visits, rates of low value care delivery were mini-
mally changed for non–safety-net and safety-net physicians,
whereas high-value care was less frequent among safety-net
physicians (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Finally, if we ex-
cluded the narcotic prescribing measures from our compos-
ite outcome, overall rates of low-value care were lower among
Medicaid or uninsured patients vs privately insured patients
(eTable 4 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In our analysis of nationally representative sample of ambu-
latory visits from 2005 to 2013, we found that the overall
delivery of low-value care was as common among patients
without insurance or with Medicaid as among the privately
insured. This was also true for physicians serving a high
proportion of Medicaid and uninsured patients compared
with those serving a low proportion. While one reasonable
hypothesis might be that patients without insurance or with
Medicaid would receive less low-value care due to financial
and social barriers to care, we do not find evidence for this.
Instead, we observe similar levels of low-value care across
different patient and physician types, suggesting that
national concerns about overuse of low-value care in Medi-
care and private insurance can be extended to lower-income
patients with Medicaid and even uninsured patients. Our
findings are consistent with a previous single-state study of
Medicaid3 and suggest that overuse is an important target
for state policymakers seeking to manage their Medicaid
budgets.
More broadly, these results suggest that physicians do not
systematically discriminate in treatment patterns across in-
surance types for low-value care, which is consistent with the
literature on managed care and other payment reforms.25-27
Ingrainedpatternsofoveruseamongphysiciansappeartotran-
scend the insurance status of the individual patient, even
among the uninsured. One other key insight from this study
is that the differences in care that we do observe by insurance
status do not appear to be driven by the different types of phy-
sicians seen by lower-income patients, given that we find simi-
lar patterns of low-value care delivered by safety net and non–
safety-net physicians. This is an important finding, because
many policy proposals aimed at Medicaid presuppose that dif-
ferential access to high quality physicians is a key challenge
for beneficiaries.28,29 Our study does not provide support for
that argument.
While overall rates of low-value care were generally com-
parable across insurance types and physician types, there were
importantdifferencesforspecificmeasures.Mostnotably,rates
of inappropriate narcotic prescribing were significantly
higher in the Medicaid and uninsured populations (though
the difference in narcotic prescribing for headaches in the
uninsured was not statistically significant). These differ-
ences drove a significant proportion of overall low-value care.
Because we lack context on the patients receiving narcotics
outside of a single visit, we are unable to identify the drivers
of this difference. However, this is a worthwhile area for
future research.

For Medicaid patients, overall rates of high-value care were
lower than for the privately insured. This could be explained
by our lack of data on important social confounders, such as
education, income, or social support, which may be respon-
sible for much of the observed differences. There have been
few quasiexperimental comparisons of private and public in-
surance, though one such recent study30 indicated similar out-
comes for low-income populations with Medicaid vs private
coverage.
In contrast, we actually find higher pooled rates of recom-
mended care among the uninsured compared with private in-
surance, though the majority of high-value measures were not
significantly different. This may be surprising given the well-
known difficulty uninsured patients have accessing care.30,31
However, for uninsured patients to be present in this analy-
sis, they must first be accessing outpatient care, implying that
ouruninsuredsampledisproportionatelyincludespatientswho
are motivated and able to receive care. This also points to the
risk of residual confounding in our study design and our in-
ability to make causal statements about the quality differ-
ence attributable to an individual having one insurance type
over another. Any argument that our findings point to a qual-
ity decrement in Medicaid would also imply that being unin-
sured is preferable to having private insurance, which is highly
unlikely.
Aside from the contrast between patient and physician
groups, overall rates of low-value care were substantial, while
ratesofhigh-valuecareweregenerallybelow50%ofvisits.This
is broadly consistent with other studies examining national
trends in the delivery of low-value or high-value care.4,21,32
Combining our results with other prior literature,21 adher-
encetostandardhigh-valuecareappearstohaveimprovedsub-
stantially in the 1990s but has been largely flat since then.32
Limitations
Our study has important limitations. First, this is a cross-
sectional, observational analysis and cannot demonstrate
causal relationships between insurance coverage or physi-
cian type and the delivery of low-value or high-value care.
Second, we rely on NAMCS and NHAMCS, which are high-
quality and validated national surveys, but nonetheless
subject to both sampling and measurement error.33 We
addressed these issues by pooling multiple years of data to
increase statistical power and assessing multiple quality
measures to avoid reliance on any single measure. Another
concern is that for most measures we are unable to assess a
comprehensive set of inclusion or exclusion criteria, such as
drug intolerance and/or allergies, because we can only use
data available within a single encounter. However, we have
no reason to believe that this measurement error should be

systematically different between different patient or physi-
cian subgroups. Other potential sources of bias are that we
rely on insurance coverage as reported by physician offices
in NAMCS and NHAMCS and cannot observe whether
patients are in managed care, which may be particularly rel-
evant for states with large Medicaid managed care pro-
grams. In addition, our statistical tests do not account for
the false-positive rate associated with testing across mul-
tiple outcomes and subgroups; therefore, the significant dif-
ferences noted between subgroups for individual quality
measures should be regarded as exploratory. Last, 8 of the
12 high-value measures we used involved prescribing for
cardiovascular disease, which may limit the generalizability
of our composite high-value care measure.
Conclusions
We found that rates of low-value care were similar among pa-
tients with Medicaid, no insurance, or private insurance cov-
erage, and between physicians serving high and low propor-
tions of uninsured and Medicaid patients. Our results appear
to be driven more by patient factors than the quality of care
delivered by safety-net physicians, whose rates of low-value
care were similar to other physicians. These results show that
in addition to improving underuse of high-value care, over-
use of low-value care is a potentially important focus for state
Medicaid programs and safety-net institutions to pursue cost-
savings and improved quality.
