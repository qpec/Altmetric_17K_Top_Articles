Abstract
Electrical measurements from large populations of animals would help reveal fundamental 
properties of the nervous system and neurological diseases. Small invertebrates are ideal for these 
large-scale studies; however, patch-clamp electrophysiology in microscopic animals typically 
requires low-throughput and invasive dissections. To overcome these limitations, we present nano-
SPEARs: suspended electrodes integrated into a scalable microfluidic device. Using this 
technology, we have made the first extracellular recordings of body-wall muscle electrophysiology 
inside an intact roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans. We can also use nano-SPEARs to record 
from multiple animals in parallel and even from other species, such as Hydra littoralis. 
Furthermore, we use nano-SPEARs to establish the first electrophysiological phenotypes for C. 
elegans models for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease, and show a partial 
rescue of the Parkinson’s phenotype through drug treatment. These results demonstrate that nano-
SPEARs provide the core technology for microchips that enable scalable, in vivo studies of 
neurobiology and neurological diseases.

 For the past century, millimeter-scale model organisms that can be rapidly raised and tested 
in a laboratory have helped reveal fundamental principles of genetics, development, and 
aging1. However, only recently have these advantages been combined with electrical 
measurements to study the nervous system2–5. Less than 20 years ago, scientists achieved 
the first single-cell electrophysiological recordings in C. elegans neurons by performing a 
manual dissection and aligning a glass micropipette electrode to the cell of interest for 
patch-clamp measurements2. Similar procedures have recorded from C. elegans muscle 
cells5 as well as cells in fruit flies3 and zebrafish larvae4; however, in all cases these 
measurements require highly invasive dissections performed by skilled researchers. These 
time consuming, manual dissection procedures limit scientists to only a few measurements 
per day with no clear path toward increased throughput2–5. Furthermore, because these 
animals are so small, any fluid expelled during dissections may significantly alter the natural 
concentrations of ions and signaling molecules. This change in physiology may contribute to 
signal degradation, such as the loss of recordings seen after just a few minutes of 
micropipette measurements from C. elegans body-wall muscles6.
Recently developed optical recording methods based on calcium- and voltage-sensitive 
fluorescence can record a proxy for electrical activity of individual cells in intact C. 
elegans7–18; however, compared to electrical recordings, optical measurements typically 
have a lower signal-to-noise ratio and reduced temporal resolution19. As a result, optical 
methods have yet to resolve individual action potentials (APs) or synaptic potentials in C. 
elegans7–18.
As an alternative to single-cell measurements, one can use suction pipettes or microfluidic 
channels to record the ensemble electrical activity from the group of cells that compose the 
C. elegans pharynx (the organ responsible for feeding)20,21. This approach provides a 
scalable method to study extracellular electrophysiology in intact C. elegans and screen for 
drugs that affect this activity21; however, these measurements are limited to the pharynx in 
nematode-like organisms. A scalable method for electrophysiology in a variety of small 
animals combined with the suite of high-throughput technologies to measure anatomical22,23 
and behavioral13,24 properties would provide unprecedented opportunities to study 
fundamental neurobiology and neurological disease models.
nano-SPEARs for small organism electrophysiology
To create a platform for scalable, cellular-resolution electrophysiology in intact small 
animals, we invented a new electrode geometry that we call nanoscale suspended electrode 
arrays (nano-SPEARs) (Fig. 1a–d; Supplementary Fig. 1). These electrodes—designed to be 
smaller than an individual cell—are suspended above the surface of a microfluidic chamber. 
This geometry allows the electrodes to press tightly against animals confined inside the 
chamber, providing a strong electrical coupling between the nano-SPEAR and the adjacent 
cell or cells. We specifically designed our first-generation nano-SPEAR devices to probe the 
body-wall muscles in the 1 mm-long worm, C. elegans (Fig. 1b–d). These 95 muscle cells, 
roughly 100 μm in length, line nearly the entire worm body-wall. The proximity of these 
muscles to the outer cuticle and their repeated pattern along the worm make them a good 
target cell for testing our devices. We found that when we immobilized C. elegans inside the

 microfluidic chamber, individual muscle cells wrap around a nano-SPEAR that we 
manufactured to be roughly 25 times smaller than a single muscle cell (4 μm wide, 3 μm 
long, 100 nm thick) (Fig. 1d). Furthermore, animals remain intact after being immobilized 
against a nano-SPEAR and resume normal locomotion after removal from the device (Fig. 
1e, Movie 1).
The concept of nano-SPEAR electrophysiology was inspired by recent experiments showing 
that high-aspect-ratio nano- and micro-structures brought into contact with cultured cells can 
develop an electrical coupling sufficient to record APs26–31. Based on these results we 
believed that nano-SPEARs would provide a less-invasive and scalable alternative to patch-
clamp electrophysiology in small organisms like C. elegans.
Using thin-film deposition procedures and electron beam- or photo-lithography, we can 
create electrodes less than 200 nm thick with a width that can be tuned from less than 200 
nm to more than 5 microns (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 2). By precisely tuning the 
geometry of the electrode we can ensure that the electrode is much smaller than the target 
cell, which could be as small as 2–4 μm in the case of C. elegans neurons2. Additionally we 
can fabricate nano-SPEARs on both silicon and glass substrates; the latter giving us the 
ability to make nano-SPEAR measurements while simultaneously performing fluorescence 
microscopy using an inverted microscope (Supplementary Fig. 1, Methods).
Our initial experiments with wild type (WT) C. elegans suggest that nano-SPEARs indeed 
record electrical activity from cells within an intact worm. When we immobilized WT day-1 
adult worms against a nano-SPEAR we observed an immediate increase in the variance of 
the voltage waveform and an appearance of putative “spikes” (Fig. 2a). This signal change 
was not seen when euthanized animals were brought into contact with the electrode (Fig. 
2a). To ensure that the recordings are electrophysiological in nature and not due to worm 
movement, we recorded activity while simultaneously imaging the worm body and muscle 
cells (Fig. 2b–c, Movies 2–3). We found that neither movement from the worm’s head nor 
body correlated with our measurements (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 3, Movie 2). In 
addition, micro-movements of the muscle cells themselves also did not correlate with our 
recordings (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 3, Movie 3). These observations combined with 
confocal images showing nano-SPEARs engulfed by body-wall muscles (Fig. 1d) suggest 
that nano-SPEARs record extracellular electrophysiological activity from the body-wall 
muscles.
Recording C. elegans muscle activity
Additional experiments using optogenetic inhibition suggest that the majority of voltage 
spikes recoded in the 1–5 Hz frequency band correspond to electrical activity of the body-
wall muscles. For example, we recorded from a transgenic strain expressing the inhibitory 
light-gated chloride pump halorhodopsin (NpHR) in the excitatory motor neurons (unc-17 
promoter, Fig. 3a). When we illuminated animals with yellow light (540–600 nm) we 
recorded a dramatic decrease in the firing rate (Fig. 3b–c, p < 0.001). The firing rate then 
returned to pre-stimulus levels when we removed the optical stimulus (Fig. 3b–c). We 
observed no light-dependent change in electrical activity in a group of control worms raised

 in the absence of all-trans retinal (ATR, a small molecule required for functional NpHR32) 
(Fig. 3c). These results indicate that the spikes recorded by nano-SPEARs primarily 
represent muscle-cell activity that is driven by excitatory motor neurons, consistent with 
results from patch-clamp recordings33. This conclusion is also supported by experiments 
using transgenic animals expressing NpHR directly in the muscle cells (myo-3 promoter, 
Supplementary Fig. 4a). While direct inhibition of muscle cells is less effective at arresting 
animal locomotion (likely due to the fact that the muscles continue to receive excitatory 
input, see Methods), we still measured a significant drop in the firing rate upon yellow-light 
illumination (Supplementary Fig. 4b, p < 0.05). Thus muscle-cell activity is a major 
contributor to the spikes observed in nano-SPEAR recordings.
As further confirmation that nano-SPEARs record electrophysiological activity from the 
body-wall muscles we found that egl-19(n582) and shk-1(ok1581) loss-of-function (lf) 
mutant worms show longer putative spike waveforms as compared to WT worms, which is 
consistent with previously reported patch-clamp electrophysiology data for body-wall 
muscle APs7,33,34 (Fig. 3d–f, Supplementary Fig. 5). In addition, egl-19(lf) have been shown 
to have a longer inter-spike-interval (ISI) as compared to WT animals33,34. When we 
analyzed our nano-SPEARs recordings from egl-19(lf) animals we found that the mean 
spike width is more than 2 times longer than the mean WT width and the inter-spike interval 
is 50% greater than WT animals (p < 0.001, Fig. 3e–f). Similarly we found that nano-
SPEAR recordings from shk-1(lf) animals showed approximately 15% longer waveforms as 
compared to WT (p < 0.001, Supplementary Fig. 5). For both egl-19(lf) and shk-1(lf), we 
found that these phenotypes do not depend on a particular choice of the spike-detection 
threshold (see Methods). Additionally, when comparing the spectrograms of the elongated 
egl-19(lf) and shk-1(lf) waveforms to WT, we observed a significant reduction in power in 
1–5 Hz frequency band, indicating that a frequency domain analysis may also help 
phenotype mutant strains (Fig. 3e–f, Supplementary Fig 5).
Together, the results of our optogenetic experiments and electrical recordings from mutant 
strains suggest that muscle-cell activity is the primary source of the spikes observed in nano-
SPEAR recordings. It should also be noted that because optogenetic inhibition does not 
completely eliminate muscle-cell activity, more work is needed to determine if synaptic and 
neuronal activity also contributes to spikes or if the remnant spiking activity is due to the 
muscle-cell activity that persists during yellow-light illumination. Future work will also help 
determine if spiking activity originates solely from individual muscle-cell APs; however, the 
small size of the electrode ensures that it is not in contact with* more than a few muscle 
cells at the same time, suggesting that activity from only one or two cells dominate the 
recordings. It should also be noted that the tapered linear channels used for worm 
immobilization likely reduce muscle cell activity, which is known to depend upon posture 
and proprioception35. Thus, comparisons between immobilized worms may not represent 
muscle activity in freely moving animals, but is nevertheless sufficient to identify 
phenotypic differences between mutant strains.
Because nano-SPEAR recordings do not require dissections we recorded from nearly 60 
worms over the course of four days (n = 28 WT, n = 30 egl-19(lf) in Fig. 3d–f), roughly 
twice the throughput of patch-clamp techniques (n = ~6–7/day)6. To determine the minimum

 sample size necessary to accurately phenotype these mutant strains, we selected random 
subsets of worms from the full dataset and calculated the spike width and ISI. We found that 
on average a sample size of only 6 worms was sufficient to quantify these metrics with less 
than a 6% error (Supplementary Fig. 6).
In addition to increasing throughput, recording from intact animals allows us to record from 
the same animal on consecutive days (Supplementary Fig. 7), raising the exciting prospect of 
measuring how age, disease progression, or drug treatment affect electrophysiology over the 
lifetime of individual animals. Additionally, we can consistently perform longer 
measurements than conventional methods (Fig. 4). We have reliably achieved 30 min 
recordings (Fig. 4a–b, n = 6), and in some cases recorded for more than 1 hr (Fig. 4, n = 2). 
The major factor limiting recording times is the fact that worms eventually crawl back along 
the tapered channel away from the nano-SPEARS; however, improvements in the 
immobilization strategy could extend the maximum recording time. While future work will 
help determine the ultimate factor limiting the length of nano-SPEAR recordings, these long 
recordings may result in the discovery of previously unknown C. elegans phenotypes and 
behaviors, such as a distinct period of quiescence exhibited by some WT adults (Fig. 4).
Versatility of nano-SPEAR recording technology
The fact that integrated nano-SPEAR devices are manufactured using semiconductor 
microfabrication technology allows us to easily reconfigure the chip layout to accommodate 
differing C. elegans postures and even interrogate other animal species. For example, we can 
record from multiple sites along a single worm and also record from worms immobilized 
with a curved posture that more closely resembles their natural body position 
(Supplementary Fig. 8). Furthermore, nano-SPEARs are not limited to nematode-like 
organisms. In fact, we can dramatically alter the geometry of the recording chamber to 
record from the freshwater cnidarian Hydra littoralis, which has distinctly different 
neuroanatomy36 (Supplementary Fig. 9). We envision that the ability to tailor microchips for 
specific experiments in a variety of model organisms will allow for a new paradigm for 
integrated small animal electrophysiology with broad impact across many neurobiology 
disciplines.
In addition to reconfiguring recording chambers for different species, we can also create 
arrays of chambers that, when paired with the appropriate microfluidic channels, can record 
from multiple animals simultaneously (Supplementary Fig. 10a–c). In a configuration 
designed for immobilizing up to four C. elegans we performed 10 experiments (for a 
maximum possible 40 worm recordings). In these experiments, we immobilized a total of 30 
animals and detected spikes in 24 (Supplementary Fig. 10). These trials were conducted over 
the course of only 1.5 hr. Thus, we achieved a throughput of 16 animals/hr—a significant 
improvement over conventional patch-clamping techniques (~1 animal/hr). Improving and 
automating the worm loading process (see Methods) can even further increase throughput, 
and provides the first clear path towards high-throughput electrophysiology at the C. elegans 
body-wall muscles at rates in excess of 100 animals/day.

 Phenotyping neurological disease models
The high-throughput potential of our nano-SPEAR technology would be particularly 
powerful for studying the synapses at the worm neuromuscular junction. These synapses 
have a conserved structure throughout the body-wall37 and share many genetic similarities to 
mammalian synapses, making them a good model for studying synaptic transmission5,8,38 
and neurodegenerative diseases39–41. In fact, many human neurodegenerative diseases can 
be modeled at the C. elegans neuromuscular junction (NMJ) including Alzheimer’s disease, 
PD and ALS39,42. High-throughput electrophysiology would enable large-scale screens for 
drugs that effectively treat C. elegans models for neurological disease and could lead to 
improved treatments for human disorders39,40,43.
To demonstrate how nano-SPEARs can facilitate the study of neurological diseases, we 
selected C. elegans models for PD and ALS44,45. These diseases are modeled by 
heterologous expression of human genes implicated in disease pathogenesis, namely, alpha-
synuclein (α-syn) for PD and G85R Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) for ALS. While 
reduced animal locomotion and cell loss have been shown in these disease models44,45, the 
electrophysiological phenotypes remain unknown, likely due to the difficulty of performing 
electrophysiology.
To identify how neuromuscular activity in PD and ALS disease models differs from healthy 
WT worms, we compared nano-SPEAR recordings in day-1 and day-2 adult worms to age-
matched WT animals (Fig. 5a). Because day-2 animals showed more pronounced 
phenotypes, we compared several electrophysiological metrics in day-2 worms to see if we 
could better distinguish ALS and PD worms using a high-dimensional phenotype (Fig. 5b, 
see Methods).
While common phenotyping metrics such as paralysis and lifespan make PD and ALS worm 
models almost indistinguishable44,45, we found that using multiple electrophysiological 
metrics based on nano-SPEAR recordings allows us to clearly differentiate between the two 
disease models (Fig. 5b). To more clearly visualize the high-dimensional phenotypes we 
created phenotypic maps by plotting the z-score with respect to WT for each metric on a 
polar plot (Fig. 5c, see Methods). Most notably, we observed a dramatic increase in the inter-
spike interval (ISI) for PD worms (~300%, p < 0.001) that was not observed in ALS worms. 
We also found a significant increase in the mean spike width of ALS worms (~30%, p < 
0.001) while PD animals exhibited shorter waveforms (~40%, p < 0.001). We also measured 
the variability in the spike width (σm) and discovered that the ALS distribution of spikes 
increased in variability compared to WT. To our knowledge, this data represents the first 
electrophysiological phenotypes for PD and ALS worm models.
While more work is needed to understand why ALS and PD models show such different 
electrophysiological phenotypes, one explanation is the fact that each disease model 
expresses the respective disease-related gene in a different group of cells: ALS is modeled in 
neurons while PD is modeled in the body-wall muscle itself44,45. This hypothesis suggests 
that synaptic input in ALS worms may reduce overall excitatory input to the body-wall 
muscle without affecting their relative health and mean ISI. In PD worms, however,

 degradation from α-syn of the body-wall muscles themselves may make them less capable 
of firing many successive spikes leading to a larger mean ISI.
Because nano-SPEARs have the ability to phenotype disease states in ALS and PD, we 
hypothesized they could also measure the efficacy of drugs for treating electrophysiological 
deficits. Indeed, when we measured day-2 adult PD worms that were treated with the known 
neuroprotective drug clioquinol (CQ)46, we discovered that the electrophysiological 
symptoms associated with this disease model were dramatically improved compared to a 
control group (Fig. 5a–c, see Methods). Notably, the ISI of treated animals was fully 
improved, supporting the hypothesis that α-syn inclusions inhibit the cell’s ability to spike 
with a regular rate. However, we did not see an improvement in the spike width of treated 
animals, which further emphasizes the fact that multiple metrics must be used to evaluate 
drug efficacy. Finally, in control animals we surprisingly measured an improvement of the 
width of waveforms. This supports previous reports that DMSO alone can affect C. elegans 
neurodegenerative models47. The phenotypic maps show that, compared to the control 
worms, treated PD worms have an electrophysiological profile that more closely matches 
WT (Fig. 5c). Overall, our ability to phenotype mutant strains and measure drug efficacy, 
shows that nano-SPEAR electrophysiology can facilitate drug screening and drug 
development using C. elegans as a model organism.
Discussion
In summary, we found that nano-SPEARs provide a platform for scalable and versatile 
electrophysiology in intact small organisms. We have shown that the nano-SPEARs 
presented here capture activity from C. elegans body-wall muscles, and that these 
measurements allow us to phenotype neurological disease models and test for drug efficacy. 
Additionally, we have shown that nano-SPEARs are not limited to recordings from C. 
elegans, but can record activity in other small organisms like Hydra. The new capabilities of 
our system, such as long-term recordings (Fig. 4) and the increased throughput 
(Supplementary Fig. 10) opens the door to highly versatile electrophysiological phenotyping 
of these common model organisms. Although electrical measurements of C. elegans body-
wall muscles provide rich data for studying NMJ activity and disease models, future work 
with smaller nano-SPEARs with widths on the order of ~100 nm (Supplementary Fig. 2) 
combined with more precise animal manipulation may enable intracellular access to the 
body-wall muscles and even recordings from neurons. A clear goal for future work is to 
develop nano-SPEARs that can perform voltage and current clamp experiments to measure 
ion channel behavior and postsynaptic potentials. We also envision that future work will 
combine the high-throughput, versatile electrophysiology of nano-SPEARs with other high-
throughput assays48 to help uncover fundamental relationships between genetics, 
electrophysiology, and behavior using small model organisms.

disease models used were NL5901 (PD) and the ALS strain was obtained from Jiou Wang 
from the work conducted in Wang, 2009 et al.4. Specifically these disease models express 
alpha-synuclein (α-syn) fused to YFP in the body-wall muscles (PD worms)5 and the G85R 
mutation of SOD1 fused to YFP in all neurons (ALS worms)4. All strains were maintained 
at approximately 21°C on nematode growth medium (NGM) seeded with OP50, unless 
stated otherwise.
Hydra strains and culture
Hydra littoralis was obtained from the Carolina Biological Supply Company. The Hydra 
were cultured at approximately 21°C in Hydra medium in a dark environment and fed 
freshly hatched Artemia naupli every other day. Hydra were starved for at least 24 hours 
before experiment to facilitate microfluidic manipulation.
Device fabrication
Silicon (Si) and glass devices were fabricated using conventional micro- and nano-
fabrication techniques6. For Si, Pt was sputtered onto a thermal oxide grown on a highly-
doped Si wafer (NOVA Electronic Materials) with an electron-beam or photo-lithography 
defined electrode pattern. During recordings, the Si wafer is grounded to reduce noise. 
Al2O3 is grown via atomic layer deposition to insulate and protect the top of the Pt. 
Photolithography with the thick photoresist KMPR-1025 (MicroChem) then defines the 
recording chamber. The photomask is aligned such that the tips of the Pt electrodes protrude 
from underneath the KMPR. We suspended the electrode tips by reactive ion etching (RIE) 
the exposed oxide and Si substrate.
Fabrication on a glass substrate (University Wafer) has the advantage of reducing the 
parasitic capacitance and allowing for high-resolution imaging through the glass substrate 
using an inverted microscope. Instead of Si, Pt electrodes are deposited onto a KMPR layer. 
A second layer of KMPR is deposited on top of the Pt electrodes and the recording 
chambers are defined using photolithography. Next, we use a RIE to etch the bottom KMPR 
layer and suspend the electrodes. Due to KMPR being a poor water barrier, devices 
fabricated on a glass substrate typically have a short lifetime (1–3 days) once in contact with 
buffer solution. This timeframe can be increased to the order of weeks by coating the entire 
wafer in ~100 nm of Parylene C. Focused ion beam milling can then be used to expose the 
electrode tips. This additional process was used data in Supplementary Fig. 4, 
Supplementary Fig. 10 and Fig. 4. For more details on fabrication, see Supplementary Fig. 1.
The completed wafers are connected to a PDMS (Sylgard) microfluidic layer that is 
approximately 4-mm thick and molded from SU-8 2050 (MicroChem). A custom acrylic 
enclosure is used to clamp the PDMS to the wafer and prevent fluid leakage. A single

 recording chamber and worm trap have a combined fluidic volume of approximately 0.7 μL. 
We used conductive epoxy to bond electrical leads to on-chip Pt pads. The average nano-
SPEAR impedance is 1.5 MΩ at 1000 Hz.
C. elegans electrophysiology
For each worm recording, we picked an individual worm from NGM and placed it an open 
syringe cap filled with M9 buffer. Tubing connected to the syringe cap leads to the 
microfluidic device and nano-SPEAR microchip. Suction applied to an opposing syringe 
brings the worm into the recording chamber. As previously seen in microfluidic devices7 and 
due to a chamber height (~60 μm) just large enough for adults, worms naturally undergo 
crawling motion when traveling down the tapering channel to the worm trap, ensuring that in 
most cases the body-wall muscles are in the proper orientation with respect to the nano-
SPEAR. Because of this, we achieved an 80% success rate for recordings (i.e. we detected 
spikes in 24 out of 30 immobilized animals, see data in Supplementary Fig. 10). When 
performing imaging we saw no significant correlation between the signal-to-noise ratio of 
recordings and the positioning of muscle cells relative to the electrode. After recordings, we 
flushed worms off-chip and removed them from the tubing. Unless stated otherwise, we 
analyzed only the first five minutes of data from each worm. All data was obtained with an 
Intan Technologies RHD2216 bipolar input amplifier at a sampling rate of 10 KHz, low 
frequency cutoff and DSP filter of 0.1 Hz and high frequency cutoff of 7.5 KHz. A nano-
SPEAR not in contact with worms was used as a reference and a low-impedance Ag/AgCl 
electrode in fluidic contact with the worm trap was used as ground.
Locomotive phenotyping
We immobilized 10 day-1 WT animals in a nano-SPEAR recording chamber for 5 min. 
Following recordings, worms were flushed from the device and onto NGM seeded with 
OP50. Control worms (n = 10) were continually kept on seeded NGM. Using previously 
established tracking software8,9, we measured animal locomotion for 2 min on a fresh, 10 
cm NGM plate with a thin, even layer of OP50 spread across the surface. Tracking occurred 
within 4 hours of recordings. These experiments took place on a single day.
Spike detection and analysis
The algorithm we developed to choose C. elegans spikes first involves using a high-order 
bandpass filter to reveal spiking activity. For phenotyping all disease models, the low- and 
high-cutoff frequencies used were 1 and 100 Hz, respectively. When comparing the spike 
waveforms of WT, shk-1(lf), and egl-19(lf) we used cutoff frequencies of 0.3 and 100 Hz. 
Before and after each experiment, we recorded several minutes of data from with no animals 
on the nano-SPEARs to determine the baseline RMS noise. We used a threshold of six-times 
the background RMS value for detecting spikes in the filtered data, but the reported trends 
between WT and other strains were constant when this threshold was increased. Both 
positive and negative waveforms are detected in the recordings, likely due to worm micro-
movement and small changes in cell-electrode coupling. Therefore, we searched for both 
negative and positive spikes when analyzing data. To avoid any potential artifacts of the 
filtering process we used raw data when comparing waveforms (with spike timing identified 
using the filtered data as described above). To form average waveforms, all detected spikes

 from each strain were made positive, scaled to the peak value, and time aligned to 75% of 
the max value on the rising edge. The reported spike widths are the full-width, half-max 
values. Unless otherwise stated, all error bars represent the standard error.

We calculated the spectrogram from the raw data from each worm with a sliding window, 
multi-taper spectrogram function from Chronux (http://chronux.org/). Averaging all 
spectrogram frequency bins across time produced the power spectrum for a worm with a 
standard error for each frequency data point. We then averaged each individual power 
spectra to produce an average power spectrum for the strain (using standard error 
propagation). For comparison between strains, we normalized the spectra by dividing by the 
maximum power.
Movement and electrophysiology recordings
Nano-SPEAR recordings were conducted while simultaneously performing either bright-
field or fluorescence imaging to measure head/body or muscle movement, respectively. WT 
animals were used for bright-field and the ZX299 (grown in the absence of ATR) for 
fluorescence imaging. The CB5600 strain was used for Movie 3. The qualitative (Fig. 2) and 
quantitative (Supplementary Fig. 3) data shown are representative from two animals; 
however, we have found similar results from other experiments. To eliminate photocurrent 
artifacts during laser scanning confocal microscopy, we tracked the movements of a muscle 
cell near the electrode rather than the cell directly against the nano-SPEAR. To account for 
any offset in the timing of the electrical and optical data, we measured the maximum of the 
cross-correlogram rather than the cross-correlation value at zero offset. To determine if the 
peak in the cross-correlogram represented statistically significant correlation between nano-
SPEAR recordings (μV) and worm movement (μm), we separated each data set into a series 
of 2–10 s intervals that could be shuffled to remove any potential correlation. For bright-
field imaging, we used a 2 s interval that shifts with a step size of 0.2 s until reaching the end 
of the data sets. For fluorescence, we used a 10 s interval that shifts with a step size of 1 s 
until reaching the end of the data sets. To remove any potential correlation between the 
nano-SPEAR recordings and movement data we independently shuffled the intervals of each 
data set. Calculating the correlograms, then extracting the maximum of the correlograms in 
each window of these shuffled data sets yields a distribution of correlation values that 
represent uncorrelated data. These data became the histogram of peak correlogram values 
for uncorrelated data. We then formed a similar distribution, based on the peak correlogram 
values of the unshuffled (e.g. time-aligned) data. We expect these distributions to be 
significantly different if movement is correlated with nano-SPEAR measurements; however, 
we found no such differences indicating that nano-SPEAR recordings are not correlated with 
animal movement.
Optogenetics
EG4813 and YX9 worms were raised in the dark on NGM plates seeded with OP50 and 
transferred to NGM plates seeded with 100 μL of OP50 supplemented with 2 μL of all-trans 
retinal (ATR) approximately 48 hr before experiments. Control worms were never in the 
presence of ATR and were also raised in the dark. Worms were imaged with white light

 filtered through a red transparency when entering the chamber, and yellow illumination 
(540–600 nm at 10 mW/mm2) was delivered with an X-cite XLED1.
EG481 animals under yellow illumination showed prolonged paralysis when crawling on 
agar. Therefore, we chose trials that consisted of a 60 s period of no illumination (Interval 
1), a 20 s period of yellow illumination with (Interval 2), and a final 60 s period of no 
illumination (Interval 3). Each worm was tested 8 times. For YX9 animals, we noticed 
yellow illumination of adult animals inhibited crawling on agar for only a few seconds. 
Thus, we chose intervals of 5 s of no illumination (Interval 1), 5 s of yellow light (Interval 2) 
and 5 s of no illumination (Interval 3). Each animal was tested 8 times. Presumably, 
paralysis of EG481 animals is more robust due to the continued release of GABA into the 
synaptic cleft when only excitatory motor neurons are inhibited. NpHR experiments were 
not performed in the lite-1 background10. The reported data in Fig. 3 and Supplementary 
Fig. 4 were taken across four days, one day for each +ATR and −ATR group.
C. elegans phenotyping
Synchronized populations were attained by standard bleaching methods. For all experiments, 
researchers were aware of the strains being tested. WT and other controls were done in no 
particular order and researchers recorded from only one strain of animals at a time. Slight 
differences from chip to chip (i.e. length of the electrodes, etc.) led to slight changes in the 
WT phenotype. To account for the variances in devices, mutant and transgenic worm were 
always compared to WT worms that were measured on the same device.
By detecting all spikes from each strain, we quantified the mean inter-spike interval (ISI) 
based on the time between spikes (the peak value defines the spike time). Also, by isolating 
each detected spike and measuring its full-width half-max, we calculated the mean width of 
a spike. The standard deviation of the distribution of spike widths for a strain is the metric 
σm. For calculating power metrics, we summed the total power of the normalized spectrum 
(see “Spectral analysis” subsection) for a strain in the designated frequency bands (<1 Hz 
and 1–5 Hz). For ISI and width metrics, error bars represent the standard error. For σm, error 
bars represent the 95% confidence intervals. For power metrics, error bars represent the 
propagated error from the power spectrum.
The WT and egl-19(lf) data was taken across four days, and the WT and shk-1(lf) data were 
taken on two separate days. The data displayed in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 5 show the 
full extent of these recording periods.
For transgenic disease models, we fabricated two sets of recording chambers with slightly 
different chamber widths to accommodate day-1 (~50 μm diameter) and day-2 (~60 μm 
diameter) adults and compared the recordings. The data for day-1 and day-2 animals 
represent two different groups of animals raised under the same conditions. To construct 
phenotypic maps, we created a polar plot such that each axis represents a single 
electrophysiology metric in units of the z-score compared to the WT value. The power 
metrics fell well beyond the z-score of the other metrics and were therefore scaled by a 
factor of 100 to make all z-scores comparable.

 Long-duration C. elegans recordings
Recordings were performed as other single-animal recordings, but were allowed to run for 
30 minutes before being stopped. We found that the primary difficulty in long-duration 
recordings was worm immobilization. Over the course of tens of minutes, animals can move 
up to several hundred microns. In the recordings displayed in Fig. 4, animals drifted < 100 
μm from the starting position. The quantified data in Fig. 4 represent animals from a single 
day of recordings, but extended recordings have been achieved with several animals on 
multiple microchips.
Parallel C. elegans recordings
Like single-worm recordings, four animals were picked from NGM and suctioned into the 
device. For each trial, typically only 2–3 animals made it to the recording chambers 
successfully. This was due to a decrease in flow rate and poor suction as more and more 
chambers are filled. All recordings lasted 3 min before they were terminated. Worms were 
removed by flushing them back out the entry port. We began timing the experiment just 
before loading the first set of animals. Within 1.5 hr, 10 different sets of animals had been 
loaded and immobilized. The displayed data in Supplementary Fig. 10 represents the full 
extent of this 1.5 hr period, but similar throughput has been achieved on other occasions. 
Phenotypic maps were constructed identically to disease models (Fig. 5) to show that the 
differences between recording chambers produce negligible changes in the 
electrophysiological phenotype compared to the effects of the disease model.
Hydra electrophysiology
Similar to C. elegans, an individual Hydra approximately 1–2 mm in size was pulled from 
Hydra media into clear tygon tubing attached to a syringe. Suction applied through 
microfluidic channels on the opposite end of the device brought the Hydra into the recording 
chamber (Supplementary Fig. 9). The microfluidic ceiling on the recording chamber 
flattened the Hydra and the narrow region near the electrodes immobilized the Hydra against 
the nano-SPEARS. Immobilization was stable throughout the experiment, with the exception 
of instances when extended body elongation led to a significant reduction in diameter of the 
Hydra body. The nano-SPEARs measured bursts of electrical activity during the animal 
contractions. These measurements resemble contraction bursts that are known to be 
associated with contraction11. The recording period was ended after 10 minutes. Upon 
completion of the experiment, Hydra was removed from the recording chamber through the 
syringe connected to the entry port. All data was obtained with an Intan Technologies 
RHD2132 unipolar input amplifier at a sampling rate of 10 KHz, low frequency cutoff and 
DSP filter of 0.1 Hz and high frequency cutoff of 7.5 KHz. The data in Supplementary Fig. 9 
displays the full extent of all trials over the course of three days.
Worm euthanizing
An adult WT worm was euthanized with M9 bath at 70°C for 1.5 min. All other recording 
conditions were identical to a typical experiment with live animals. The trace in Fig. 2 
represents the entirety of the data collected.

 Clioquinol (CQ) treatment
CQ has been shown to protect C. elegans dopaminergic neurons from α-syn toxicity12. We 
hypothesized CQ would therefore protect body-wall muscles from α-syn toxicity and 
preserve WT electrophysiology. PD worms were synchronized using bleaching methods and 
the eggs were incubated in a 30 μM CQ, 1% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) in M9 solution for 24 
hrs at room temperature. After the incubation period, the larvae were plated on NGM until 
reaching day-2 adulthood. In parallel with the treated worms, control worms underwent the 
same protocol but were never in the presence of CQ. The data from treated animals in Fig. 5 
represent one test and one control group.
Statistical analyses
All statistical methods used and subsequent p-values are reported in figure captions. For 
experiments in which t-tests or ANOVA tests were used, the data was assumed to be 
normally distributed and variance equality was checked using Levene’s test. If only two 
groups were being compared and the variance was found to be different, a Welch’s t-test was 
used rather than a Student’s t-test. In experiments that compared three or more groups, we 
found that only one data set, disease model phenotyping (Fig. 5), did not meet the equal 
variance requirements for ANOVA statistics. Significance overestimation is likely minimal 
because all groups have similar sample sizes in this experiment; however, to take into 
account the possibility of overestimating significance, we chose only p < 0.01 as significant 
for these metrics. To accommodate the possibility that some data may not be normally 
distributed, we also ran non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests for all experiments in which 
normality was assumed. In all but one case, the reported results remain significant. One 
experiment: the ISI metric when phenotyping day-2 disease models (Fig. 5) would not be 
significantly different unless normality is assumed. Thus, future work may be needed to 
fully interpret the ISI metric in immobilized disease models. To determine significance 
between frequency bands of power spectrums, we used a Kruskal-Wallis test with a post hoc 
Dunn-Sidak test.

measurement with no worm in the recording chamber. (center) Recording from a dead worm 
immobilized on a nano-SPEAR. (bottom) The trace and corresponding spectrogram show a 
dramatic change in the amplitude and frequency of measurements when a worm is 
immobilized against a nano-SPEAR. The spectrogram shows that spiking activity resides 
primarily in the 1–5 Hz frequency band. All traces have been bandpass filtered with cutoff 
frequencies of 1 and 100 Hz. b, Representative nano-SPEAR recordings (gray) show no 
apparent correlation with simultaneously recorded displacement of the body (orange) or the 
head (blue). c, Likewise, representative nano-SPEAR recordings (gray) show no apparent

 Figure 3. nano-SPEARs record electrophysiological activity from C. elegans body-wall muscles
a, An illustration of the C. elegans body-wall neuromuscular junction with the light-gated 
chloride pump, NpHR, expressed in excitatory motor neurons under the unc-17 promoter. b, 
Worms expressing NpHR show a reduction in firing rate under yellow illumination (Interval 
2). Top trace shows a representative nano-SPEAR recording (bandpass filtered between 1 
and 100 Hz). Yellow bar denotes the time period of yellow light (540–600 nm) illumination. 
Raster plot (center) shows spike times recorded from 4 different worms each tested 8 times. 
The histogram shows a drop in spike frequency during illumination. c, Mean firing rates for 
test worms raised with ATR (NpHR +ATR) show a significant drop in firing rate during 
illumination. A small, but not statistically significant drop in the firing rate was observed in 
control animals (NpHR −ATR) during illumination, likely due to a weak endogenous photo-
inhibition effect. (n = 4 for NpHR +ATR, 32 total trials; n = 5 for NpHR −ATR, 40 total 
trials; ***p < 0.001, ns = not significant, one-way ANOVA with a post hoc Bonferroni test 
compared to Interval 1, error bars are the standard error). d, Representative data from WT 
(gray) and egl-19(lf) (blue) mutant worms. Traces are bandpass filtered with cutoff 
frequencies of 0.3 and 100 Hz. e, Average waveforms for each strain. The spectrogram is 
calculated from the mean waveform. Qualitative differences can be seen in the waveform 
width and the total power in the frequency band above 1 Hz. f, As expected from previously 
reported patch-clamp measurements, egl-19(lf) animals have a longer spike width and ISI. 
Longer egl-19(lf) waveforms also lead to less power in the 1–5 Hz frequency domain in the 
spectrograms from (e) (n = 28 for WT and 30 for egl-19(lf); ***p < 0.001 unpaired, two-
sided Student’s t-test, error bars represent the standard error).

 Figure 4. nano-SPEARs record continuously for tens of minutes
a, Continuous 30 min recordings from six WT animals (traces are bandpass filtered between 
1 and 100 Hz). b, We quantified the firing rate (top), spike width (middle) and spike 
amplitude (bottom) for each animal with respect to time. Black lines indicate the mean. The 
firing rate varies significantly from worm to worm with most animals showing a decrease in 
firing rate over time; however, one animal displayed periods of quiescence lasting for several 
minutes (orange traces). On the other hand, the spike width and spike amplitude remain 
relatively constant throughout the recording; however, when the firing rate diminishes to

 near zero (blue trace), the width and amplitude become highly variable because there are a 
small number of spikes that contribute to the ensemble average. c, A 70-minute-long 
continuous recording from a WT animal (traces are bandpass filtered between 1 and 100 
Hz). Similar to (b), this animal showed distinct periods of quiescence during the second half 
of the recording, indicated by a clear drop in the spike rate. Insets are 3 min intervals that 
show normal spiking activity (left) and the abrupt transition to quiescence (right).

 Figure 5. nano-SPEARs reveal phenotypes for neurodegenerative disease models
a, Characteristic traces for WT and all disease models tested (bandpass filtered between 1 
and 100 Hz). Day-1 and day-2 measurements represent distinct cohorts of animals selected 
randomly from a synchronized population on consecutive days. b, Quantified 
electrophysiology metrics (see Methods) for day-2 adult worms show differences in spike 
statistics between disease models and age-matched WT controls (**p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001;

 > 95% confidence interval for WT). PD worms treated with CQ (+CQ/DMSO) show a full 
rescue of the power metrics and mean ISI, which is not observed in control worms 
(+DMSO) (see Methods). Error bars represent the standard error, or 95% confidence 
intervals in the case of Spike Width σm. c, Phenotypic maps show a geometric visualization 
of the data in (b). Cyan polygons are created by connecting the z-score with respect to WT 
(zwt) on five axes representing different metrics (see Key). A phenotypic map for a WT 
animal creates the gray pentagon. ALS and PD worms show distinct age progressive 
phenotypes. When PD larvae were raised in the drug CQ (+CQ/DMSO), day-2 adults 
showed nearly complete rescue of the WT five-dimensional phenotype.
