❚ ABSTRACT
Objective: To adapt the Knowledge about Homosexuality Questionnaire to Brazilian Portuguese, and 
to assess knowledge of heterosexual physicians on homosexuality. Methods: The following steps for 
cultural adaptation were made: translation by two independent evaluators, translation synthesis, 
and evaluation of semantic properties by the target population, followed by the development of 
a pilot study and administration of the instrument to 224 heterosexual physicians working in the 
Brazilian Federal District. Results: The mean number of correct answers in the questionnaire was 
11.8 (SD=2.81) out of 18 items, i.e., 65.5%. Catholic and evangelical physicians gave a significant 
lower number of correct answers compared with those who believed in other religions or who 
did not believe in any religion (p=0.009), and 40% of sample did not know that homosexuality 
is not considered a disease. Conclusion: This study adapted the American instrument entitled 
Knowledge about Homosexuality Questionnaire and provided evidence for its validation in Brazil, 
revealing physicians’ lack of knowledge about several aspects related to homosexuality. The 
findings of this study may help in guiding improvements in medical training and practice.

❚ INTRODUCTION
Several studies have shown differences in the prevalence 
of diseases and risk factors in the lesbian, gay, bisexual 
and transgender (LGBT) [population in comparison 
to heterosexuals, such as: a higher rate of smoking;(1-4) 
excessive alcohol use;(1,2,4) obesity;(1,2,4,5) drug use;(3,6-8) 
and cardiovascular diseases.(1) One possible explanation 
for that, according to the Minority Stress Model, is that 
minorities are more susceptible to health problems 
because they experience chronic stress due to social 
stigmatization. 
The discrimination sexual minorities suffer when 
seeking medical attention has been brought to light 
by a few medical societies, such as the American 
Geriatrics Society. In 2015 this association reported the 
following evidence regarding healthcare for the LGBT 
public: refusal of certain medical treatments; incorrect 
assumption that the patient is heterosexual; refusal to 
accept certain companions chosen by the patient during 
hospitalization offensive and derogatory statements. 
These factors can lead the LGBT population to delay 
or avoid seeking medical attention for fear of being 
subjected to discrimination.(9,10)
A recently published systematic review assessed 
the relation of the LGBT public with the healthcare 
system and showed several issues, such as lack of 
training for healthcare professionals, who have difficulty 
approaching sexuality related matters and operate 
under a heteronormativity premise; barriers and 
institutionalized prejudiced practices; demands of 
sexual minorities that are not met, which increases 
the risk of mental illness, suicide, cancer and a higher 
susceptibility to sexually transmitted diseases; increased 
internalized homophobia due to a perceived rejection 
by medical professionals who should treat and welcome 
all patients; fear of accessing medical services, which 
leads to avoidance or delays in treatment; concealment 
of sexual orientation; increase of self-medication or 
seeking information about treatment at drugstores, in 
magazines, with friends or online; late seeking of medical 
services in extreme or emergency cases; experiencing 
of homophobic statements, humiliation, ridicules and 
breach of confidentiality.(11)
Moreover, studies have shown the relation between 
lack of knowledge about homosexuality and negative 
or prejudiced attitudes from physicians, undergraduate 
medical students and other healthcare professionals 
regarding the LGBT population.(12-16)
The lack of studies in Brazil that evaluate physicians’ 
knowledge about homo- and bisexuality may be partly 
explained by the lack of specific questionnaires that 
evaluate the knowledge of elementary aspects of 
homosexuality. We believe that having questionnaires 
available in Portuguese could make it possible to 
evaluate physicians’ knowledge and implement policies 
regarding medical services for the LGBT population. 
The Knowledge about Homosexuality Questionnaire 
(KHQ), one of the most frequently used questionnaires 
in the world, is an instrument about general knowledge 
regarding homosexuality.(17)
 
❚ OBJECTIVE
To adapt the Knowledge about Homosexuality 
Questionnaire to Brazil and evaluate the knowledge of 
heterosexual physicians about homosexuality. 
 
❚ METHODS
Participants
The recruiting method chosen was the “snowball 
technique”, using a promotion of the research and 
inviting physicians via e-mail, social networks, and 
societies of different specialties. We included active 
physicians working in the Federal District of Brazil who 
are self-declared heterosexuals. The sample calculation 
followed the recommendations of having ten participants 
for each observable variable.(18,19) Therefore, considering 
the original inventory presents 20 items, we sought a 
sample of at least 200 valid cases. The exclusion criteria 
were not disclosed to the participants in order to avoid 
inhibitions or embarrassing situations, especially with 
regards to information about sexual orientation. In 
these cases, the physicians were only excluded from the 
sample in the data analysis process.
Initially, 306 physicians of both genders responded 
to the survey. Of those, 45 were excluded for not 
completing their participation, 17 for not working in 
the Federal District, 13 for not being heterosexual, and 
7 for being retired. 
The instrument
The KHQ addresses central and objective aspects of 
homosexuality, distinguishing it from other characteristics 
it is often erroneously associated to. This instrument 
evaluates knowledge and not beliefs or opinions, focusing 
on the cognitive and not emotional or behavioral elements 
of the answers.(17)
For this study we decided to use the version of KHQ 
modified by Koch, in which two items were removed 
(due to the results of a validation process in their 
sample) and the option “I do not know” was introduced 
 What do physicians know about homosexuality? Translation and adaptation of Knowledge about Homosexuality Questionnaire
3
einstein (São Paulo). 2018;16(3):1-9
to allow a more reliable assessment of knowledge. This 
modified version has 18 true/false items regarding 
knowledge about homosexuality and generates a score 
of zero to 18, where 18 means 100% correct.(20) Thus, 
the higher the number of correct answers, the higher 
the knowledge. The number of correct items was 
converted into a percentage of correct answers: no 
correct answers = 0% and 18 correct answers = 100%.
A study carried out the United States, in 2003, 
used this version modified by Koch (18 items) with 
408 professors and had an average correctness of 9.71 
(standard deviation – SD of 3.49), that is, 54% of items 
with Cronbach’s alpha of 0.72.(21) The construct validity 
evidence showed that the respondents with a higher 
level of education obtained the highest scores and a 
sexual education professor was accurate in all items.(22)
Procedures
This study followed all procedures to ensure accuracy 
of contents of the original instrument, which included 
translation of the original language into the target 
language by two evaluators; synthesis of the translated 
versions; analysis of the final version by two expert 
judges; semantic evaluation by the target audience; and 
a pilot study.(19)
The translation was done by two people separately: 
an experienced researcher in the area of instrument 
adaptation, and a professional with no ties to academia, 
both of whom are fluent in English. The synthesis of 
the two translations was conducted by a group of 
three university lecturers of psychometrics, with a vast 
knowledge on instrument adaptation, who met to 
evaluate each item of the two translated versions and 
then conflate them into one new version. The discussion 
over the final version included the authors and one of the 
psychometrics researchers.
Lastly, the final version was presented to the target 
audience for the penultimate stage of the adaptation 
process. In the stage, the target audience of 22 
physicians was invited to evaluate the questionnaire’s 
items to determine if the items were clear or not, and 
to suggest alterations for items they believed were not 
clear. The physicians were chosen for convenience – 
several physicians were sent invitations and those who 
agreed to participate in this stage were selected. At the 
end of the stage of instrument application to this group 
of physicians who formed the target audience, their 
suggestions were evaluated by the researchers and the 
psychometrist, so that a final decision could be reached 
regarding which suggestions would be taken, thus 
arriving at the final version of both instruments. This 
final version was then applied to the group of physicians 
from the pilot study.
After the alterations were made, the instrument was 
made available on an online data collection platform, 
so we could conduct the quantitative pilot study, which 
included 42 physicians. We also included items about 
the participants’ demographic data such as age (in 
years), sex (male/female), religion (catholic, evangelical, 
spiritist, none, or other), marital status (single, married/
common-law marriage, separated/divorced, widow/er), 
professional practice (acting physician, resident, retired, 
non-acting), and sexual orientation (heterosexual, 
homosexual, bisexual, none of the above, I do not 
know, other). The only change between the pilot study 
and the next stage of the study data collection was 
that a question was added about the place of work (in 
the Federal District, outside the Federal District, in 
and outside the Federal District). The reason for that 
added questions was the risk that, because we used the 
“snowball technique”, the survey would reach physicians 
who do not work in the Federal District, which would 
hinder the sample’s characterization and consistency. 
Data collection took place between March and 
September 2016. The study was authorized by the 
Research Ethics Committee of the organization under 
protocol n° 1.339.076, CAAE: 49275115.0.0000.5558, 
and the use of an informed consent was waived, since it 
could deter or identify the participants. The request for 
a limited set of sociodemographic data helped ensure 
the study’s anonymity, even to the authors. 
Data analysis
In the evaluation process, all items were transformed so 
that all incorrect or “I do not know” answers received 
a score of 0, and correct answers received a score of 1. 
Thus, the higher the average obtained, the higher the 
number of correct answers. 
The data were analyzed with descriptive statistics 
to obtain frequency distributions through the software 
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), 
version 21. After that, we performed inferential analyses 
through Spearman’s correlation test to check if there 
was a relation between KHQ’s total score and other 
variables studied, and we used Student’s t test for 
independent samples. 
 
❚ RESULTS
In the stage of evaluation by the target audience (fourth 
stage of the adaptation process), we evaluated 22 
physicians who responded to the instrument and were

, Camargos EF
4
einstein (São Paulo). 2018;16(3):1-9
asked about clarity of items. Some suggestions in the 
evaluation by the target audience were not contemplated 
in the instrument’s final version when the suggested 
“lack of clarity” was not due to a semantic or idiomatic 
problem but to the respondent’s lack of knowledge on 
elementary aspects of homosexuality. 
Item 1, which stated “a child who engages in 
homosexual behavior will become a homosexual 
adult” was classified as unclear by three out of the 22 
participants. This item refers to some sexual games 
children play with other children of the same gender, 
but some members of the target audience are not aware 
of this type of activity among children. Therefore, it 
was suggested that the item be changed to “displays 
homosexual behavior”. However, this alteration would 
change the meaning of the item and could raise doubts 
about the aspects related to gender manifestation (e.g. 
boys with feminine behaviors). For that reason, this 
suggestion was not accepted. Even though we kept 
the semantic characteristics of the item, and questions 
were raised regarding the use of the term “homosexual” 
referring to children, for whom most practices are more 
guided by curiosity and a wish to belong to the group 
than by affective/sexual desire. Even if we had considered 
that the term “sexual games among children of the same 
gender” would make the item even clearer, this change 
would mean much modification from the original 
version and so we decided against it, considering the 
term “behavior” belongs to the dimension of practices 
and attitudes and not necessarily desire. 
Item 5 in the version before evaluation by the target 
audience stated that “sexual orientation is established 
at an early age”. Five physicians pointed out that “at 
an early age” is quite imprecise, and the suggested 
alteration was accepted. The item was then rewritten 
to “sexual orientation is established at an early age 
(during adolescence or even before that)”, which 
is in accordance with the American Academy of 
 
Pediatrics.(23) 
Item 12 resulted in significant changes from the 
original which read: “Kinsey and many other researchers 
consider sexual behavior as a continuum from exclusively 
homosexual to exclusively heterosexual.” It was altered 
to “Many researchers consider sexual behavior as a 
continuum that goes from exclusively homosexual to 
exclusively heterosexual.” This alteration was done 
because researcher Alfred Kinsey, despite his great 
importance in the field of human sexuality studies in 
the 1940s and 1950s, is not widely known in Brazil, 
except by professionals who have studied about human 
sexuality. Therefore, the item was altered, but was 
still classified as unclear by half of the target audience 
(11 physicians) regarding the term “continuum”. We 
decided to try to provide a more comprehensive idea 
of gradation, as suggested by the target audience, 
without deconfiguring the original item, which required 
a certain level of knowledge about sexuality and could 
therefore be unclear to some professionals. The final 
version of Item 12 was: “Many researchers consider 
sexual behavior to be a continuum that can vary from 
exclusively homosexual to exclusively heterosexual.” 
By adding the phrase “that can vary from”, the word 
continuum was understood as an idea of gradation 
between two opposites. 
Item 13, “a homosexual person’s gender identity 
does not agree with their biological sex”, was not 
understood by seven physicians. They suggested we 
added an explanation of “gender identity”, which is a 
clear example that the item’s lack of clarity could be 
due to a lack of knowledge on the subject by part of the 
target audience and not due to flaws in the adaptation 
process.
Item 18, which originally read “Recent research 
has shown that homosexuality may be linked to 
chromosomal differences” was adapted to “Recent 
research has shown that homosexuality may be related 
to genetic differences” as suggested by the researcher, in 
light of the current knowledge that suggested a relation 
between homosexuality and genetic alterations linked 
to the X chromosome.(24) In the evaluation by the target 
audience, no alterations were suggested for this item. 
After the adaptation phase, the instrument’s final 
version was added to the online platform for the second 
stage of the research (sample evaluation). 
The final sample included 224 heterosexual 
physicians who worked in the Federal District, aged 
between 24 and 72 years (mean age 42.2 years; SD=9.5 
years), 149 (66.5%) of whom were female (Table 1).
Of 261 physicians who completed the research, 248 
(95%) declared themselves heterosexual. 
The mean of correct answers was 11.8 (SD 2.81) 
of 18 items, that is, 65.5% of all items. The number of 
correct answers ranged between 2 and 18 (alpha=0.61). 
The ‘catholic’ and ‘evangelical’ categories combined 
had a significantly lower number of correct items, with 
a mean of 11.43 (SD 2.77) in comparison to ‘other’ or 
‘no religion’, whose correct items had a mean of 12.42 
(SD 2.78; t(222)=2.63; p=0.009, d=0.47 – variables not 
adjusted for age). No differences were found in answers 
between male and female physicians, t(222)<1, p=ns.
Item 14 had the highest percentage of wrong 
answers. It read: “Historically, almost every culture has 
evidenced widespread intolerance toward homosexuals, 
viewing them as sick or as sinners”. Only 16.5% of

participants marked the statement as false, which is 
the correct answer. Item 17 had the highest number 
of correct answers. It stated that “Bisexuality may be 
characterized by sexual behaviors and/or responses to 
both sexes”, and was marked as true, which is the correct 
answer, by 96.6% of participants (T
able 2). Item 2, which 
states “There is a good chance of changing homosexual

physicians did not know if that is in fact possible, and 
7.6% thought it was possible. Item 6, “Homosexuality 
is an illness, was responded to with ‘I do not know’ by 
34.4% of participants and ‘yes’ by 4.9%.
Item 10, “a person becomes a homosexual because 
he/she chooses to do so”, was marked as ‘true’ by 
32.1% of physicians, and 13.8% of them said they did 
not know. That showed that half the physicians were 
unaware of the several biopsychosocial aspects related 
to homosexuality and believe it to be an individual 
choice. 
 
❚ DISCUSSION
Differences regarding health status among heterosexuals 
and non-heterosexuals are well described in the 
literature from the United States, motivating policies 
of specific care, committees for training and refresher 
courses for physicians of different specialties. In 
Brazil, however, there are no studies that use specific 
inventories (instead of general sexuality aspects) to 
evaluate the knowledge of physicians on homosexuality. 
That leaves the literature with a significant gap of 
information that could be translated into healthcare 
policies and professional training. 
Even during the stage of instrument adaptation, the 
process of evaluating the target audience was complex 
because this tool is an inventory of knowledge and not 
of opinions, beliefs or behavior reports. The target 
audience often showed a lack of clarity regarding some 
items, which, in reality, showed the physicians’ lack of 
knowledge on the subject, but no flaws in the adaptation 
process.

The two items which had the highest number 
of correct answers in our study were also the ones 
with the most correct answers in a study conducted 
with high school teachers in the United States, which 
demonstrates that this knowledge is not restricted to 
the field of health. The two items in question are about 
the concept of bisexuality and the term “coming out”.(21)
On the other hand, even though homosexuality has 
not been considered a disease by the American Psychiatric 
Association (AP
A) since 1973 - making conversion therapy 
inappropriate and lacking in scientific support - 25% of 
physicians in our sample either believed conversion was 
possible or answered that they did not know, and almost 
40% of them did not know that homosexuality is not 
considered a disease. Moreover, the American Medical 
Association condemns “reparative therapies” which seek 
to convert homosexuals to heterosexuals.(25)
The fact that a significant number of physicians 
are unaware of aspects that distinguish gender identity 
from sexual orientation stands out. One out of four 
physicians does not know if, or equivocally believes 
that, “most homosexuals want to be members of the 
opposite sex” (Item 3). This lack of knowledge was also 
clear on the item that reads “a homosexual person’s 
gender identity does not agree with his/her biological 
sex” (Item 13) – only 44.6% of participants marked 
the correct answer. That shows that the majority of 
participants did not know that homosexuality represents 
sexual desire (affective and/or sexual attraction for 
people of the same sex), and not a gender dysphoria 
(strong desire to belong to the other gender group), 
which is the current accepted term according to the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
5th Edition (DSM-5).(26) These two manifestations are 
different and require healthcare professionals to take 
different approaches due to their specificities.
We also found that about 33% of respondents believed 
that homosexuality is a personal choice. It is noteworthy 
that the belief that homosexuality is a personal choice is 
linked to higher levels of homophobia.(12)
Different studies have found that scores of knowledge 
about homosexuality are generally lower among men 
and religious people.(13,16) A study with physicians and 
students conducted in Serbia evaluated the knowledge 
about homosexuality and the attitude of participants 
regarding homosexuals. The study found that the 
individuals who were most knowledgeable about the 
subject were the ones with the least negative attitudes 
towards homosexuals.(13) In the present study, no 
significant differences in knowledge were found between 
men and women, which may be a bias of the sample 
selection type (snowball).
Even though there are studies that suggest that a 
better knowledge of homosexuality can lead to more 
positive attitudes towards sexual minorities,(13,14) the 
reality of some Brazilian universities seems to be very 
far from that. A study evaluating undergraduate 
medical students from public and private universities 
in the Brazilian city of T
eresina, State of Piauí, showed 
sexuality classes essentially revolve around organic and 
pathological aspects and pay little attention to themes 
like sexual orientation, homophobia and gender roles.(27)

Another study evaluated 455 undergraduate medical 
students from the Faculdade de Medicina de Botucatu, 
in the State of São Paulo, and found that only 59% of 
male students knew that homosexuality is not a disease, 
while that number reached 80% among the female 
students. The item “a lesbian would prefer a man, if he 
were a real man and used the correct technique” was 
believed to be true, marked ‘I do not know’ or left blank 
by 38% of male and female students. In the evaluation 
where the students were divided according to their 
time in the course (first or second year, third or fourth 
year, and fifth or sixth year), no differences were 
found, among male or female students, regarding the 
knowledge that homosexuality is not a disease. That 
suggests that a medical student may graduate without 
that knowledge, despite the limitations mentioned by 
the authors of theirs being a cross-sectional and not a 
longitudinal study.(28)
One of the main limitations of our research is related 
to the snowball sample selection type, which could 
mean the sample is not representative of physicians in 
the Federal District. Studies with randomized samples 
may minimize possible selection biases. Moreover, 
longitudinal studies would be more recommended 
to evaluate the impact that better information about 
homosexuality would have on the attitude of medical 
staff and on the quality of clinical care provided to gays, 
lesbians and bisexuals. The application of the KHQ 
in this sample of physicians from the Federal District 
showed that several physicians are not familiar with 
several aspects of homosexuality. That may be related 
to more negative attitudes towards sexual minorities. 
Educational interventions during medical school and 
for graduated professionals may minimize this problem. 
Further studies are necessary to better understand the 
profile of physicians in relation to the LGBT population 
and study manners of educational interventions in order 
to minimize these problems. 
 
❚ CONCLUSION
The adaptation and application of the Knowledge about 
Homosexuality Questionnaire in a sample of physicians 
from the Federal District of Brazil showed important 
aspects of their lack of knowledge about elementary 
characteristics of homosexuality and its related 
situations. The availability of a comprehensive and 
specific questionnaire about sexual orientation will 
allow more studies to be conducted with other samples 
(physicians and other healthcare professionals) and yield 
policies that widen the knowledge of the professionals, 
thus bringing improvements to the medical care of this 
population.
