Nutrition Survey

BACKGROUND: Studies examining the association between dairy consumption and metabolic health have shown mixed results.
This may be due, in part, to the use of different definitions of dairy, and to single types of dairy foods examined in isolation.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to examine associations between dairy food intake and metabolic health, identify
patterns of dairy food consumption and determine whether dairy dietary patterns are associated with outcomes of metabolic
health, in a cross-sectional survey.
DESIGN: A 4-day food diary was used to assess food and beverage consumption, including dairy (defined as milk, cheese, yogurt,
cream and butter) in free-living, healthy Irish adults aged 18–90 years (n = 1500). Fasting blood samples (n = 897) were collected,
and anthropometric measurements taken. Differences in metabolic health markers across patterns and tertiles of dairy
consumption were tested via analysis of covariance. Patterns of dairy food consumption, of different fat contents, were identified
using cluster analysis.
RESULTS: Higher (total) dairy was associated with lower body mass index, %body fat, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio
(Po0.001), and lower systolic (P = 0.02) and diastolic (Po0.001) blood pressure. Similar trends were observed when milk and
yogurt intakes were considered separately. Higher cheese consumption was associated with higher C-peptide (Po0.001). Dietary
pattern analysis identified three patterns (clusters) of dairy consumption; 'Whole milk', 'Reduced fat milks and yogurt' and 'Butter
and cream'. The 'Reduced fat milks and yogurt' cluster had the highest scores on a Healthy Eating Index, and lower-fat and
saturated fat intakes, but greater triglyceride levels (P = 0.028) and total cholesterol (P = 0.015). conclusion: Overall, these results
suggest that while milk and yogurt consumption is associated with a favourable body phenotype, the blood lipid profiles are less
favourable when eaten as part of a low-fat high-carbohydrate dietary pattern. More research is needed to better understand this
association.
CONCLUSION: Overall, these results suggest that although milk and yogurt consumption is associated with a favourable body
phenotype, the blood lipid profiles are less favourable when eaten as part of a low-fat high-carbohydrate dietary pattern. More
research is needed to better understand this association.

INTRODUCTION
The topic of dairy food consumption and its relationship to
metabolic health is controversial.1 Dairy products, particularly
higher-fat dairy products such as cheese, butter, cream and full-
cream milk are considered significant sources of energy, and of
saturated fat (SFA), contributing ~ 20% of dietary SFA intakes in
Ireland2 and the in UK.3 Figures from the United States are similar;
cheese alone contributes to 16.5% of SFA intakes, whereas milk
contributes 8.5%, and margarine and butter (grouped together)
contribute 5.8%.4 While many dairy products are considered
energy dense, bovine milk is also well-recognised as an important
contributor
to
nutrients
in
the
human
diet,2,5
containing
amino acids, fats and oligosaccharides, as well as a range of
nutrients including calcium, magnesium, iodine, riboflavin, folate,
B vitamins, vitamin A and vitamin E.5 Some dairy products,
cheeses in particular, are known sources of bioactive peptides
with varying functions.6 In addition, many dairy foods contain
various other bioactive compounds, such as oligosaccharides, and
sphingolipids.7,8
Over 60% of the fat in dairy fat is saturated,9 yet reports suggest
potential health benefits of dairy food consumption on a variety of
aspects of metabolic health.7,9–14 These include: an association
with reduced body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference;10
improvement
of
blood
lipid
profiles;11–13
reduced
risk
of
hypertension;14 improvement of glycaemic responses15 and
reduced risk of type 2 diabetes.16,17 However, conflictions exist
in the current literature, with a number of reports observing no
association with dairy intake and various markers of metabolic
health.18–23 These different findings may be partly due to the
variety of available dairy foods, and differing levels of fat within
these.24 One particular issue is a lack of a standard definition of
‘high’ and ‘low’ fat dairy foods; with many studies grouping full fat
or whole milk, cheeses, cream and butter into ‘high fat dairy’24,25
while semi-skimmed and skimmed milk, and reduced fat yogurt
are often grouped in ‘low fat dairy’.24 However, these groupings

 are not consistent, and vary from study to study. For example,
Larsson et al.26 used a 3% fat cut-off point for ‘high fat’ dairy; other
researchers have used figures of 3.5%,27 while others do not detail
the fat levels used for the determination of ‘high’ and ‘low’ fat
dairy in their analyses.25,28 Some researchers have used multiple
cut-off values within the one analysis;29,30 depending on the dairy
product. This lack of a universal definition results in dairy foods
being grouped differentially into ‘high’ and ‘low’ fat, depending
on the study, and may impact results by obscuring potential
differences in the effect of the varying fat content on markers of
metabolic health. Further, categorisations based on fat content
alone ignore the rest of the food ‘matrix’ in which that fat is
consumed. The food matrix describes foods in the context of both
their structure, and their nutrient content, with the goal of
understanding how these interact together. Recent research
suggests that the overall food matrix in which a nutrient is
consumed is an important consideration, as evidenced by
different dairy foods (mainly butter vs cheese) with the same
SFA content having quite different effects on blood lipids in
randomised controlled feeding studies.11,13,31–33 When examining
the link to health, intakes are often examined at a total dairy
intake level, or considered by intakes of a specific dairy
component, such as milk34 or cheese,35 without addressing the
impact of the combinations of foods consumed in different dietary
patterns. The use of dietary pattern analysis allows for the capture
of natural eating patterns36 and thus affords a novel opportunity
to incorporate the different fat contents of dairy foods into an
analysis, and examine how they are eaten in combination, and
how these relate to metabolic health. The Irish diet is relatively
homogenous with most people consuming dairy foods,37 there-
fore allowing patterns of dairy product intake to be examined.
Dietary intake in Ireland is consistent with the UK,3 with relatively
high dairy intakes as observed in other Northern European
countries.38
This paper aims to address knowledge gaps in the association
of dairy food consumption and its relationship to metabolic health
markers (Anthropometric measures, serum lipids, blood pressure,
HOMA and QUICKI scores, and inflammatory cytokines) using
different definitions of dairy. Associations will be examined using
standard tertile analysis, and then using dietary pattern analysis, to
incorporate a measure of the different types of dairy foods eaten,
and the patterns in which they are consumed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mean daily intakes of dairy foods
Dietary intake data were available for n = 1500 people as part of the
National Adult Nutrition Survey (NANS) conducted in the Republic of
Ireland from 2008 to 2010.39 Ethical approval for the study was received
from the Human Research Ethics Committee at the University College
Dublin, and by the University College Cork Clinical Research Ethics
Committee of the Cork Teaching Hospitals. Written, informed consent was
obtained from participants before commencing the study, and participants
were randomly selected from a national database to represent the
population in terms of the urban–rural divide, age, sex and social class,
based on the 2006 census, with a 59.6% response rate.40 Each food and
beverage consumed over a 4-day period was recorded and entered into a
semi-weighed food diary. In brief, participants were given a set of scales,
trained in their use, and were requested to weigh all foods and beverages,
whenever possible over a 4-day period. Leftovers were also recorded. For
any items where weighing was not possible, an estimate was obtained via
an interview, using a food portion size atlas, during one of the three visits
made to participants by researchers over the 4-day collection period. Other
details were also obtained including brand information, cooking methods
and eating location. Full details of methodology are published elsewhere.39
Using the database of all foods consumed in the NANS, a mean daily intake
(g per day) of total dairy foods consumed was calculated for each person,
where intakes from discrete foods and composite dishes were included.
Mean daily amounts (g per day) of each individual dairy food consumed
were also calculated. All participants in the study consumed dairy in some
form (either as discrete foods or as an ingredient) over the 4-day period.
Tertiles of individual dairy food intakes were created. This was done by
ranking participants based on their mean daily intake of each, and
assigning them into ‘low’, ‘medium’ and ‘high’ intake groups, and ‘non-
consumers’. A healthy eating index (HEI) was created based on the
alternate HEI (AHEI), as adapted by McCullough et al.41 In brief, the AHEI is
a score based on nine components calculated from daily servings of fruit
and vegetables, alcohol, nuts and soy, and cereal fibre, the ratio of red to
white meat, the ratio of polyunsaturated fat to SFA, percentage energy
from trans fat and duration of multivitamin use.41
Identification of dairy patterns
To examine patterns of dairy intake by percentage energy contribution to
diet, variables of mean daily intakes per MJ of energy intake were created
for the main dairy foods consumed (milk, cheese, yogurt, butter and
cream), and for each of the subtypes of dairy foods, based on fat content.
These were: total milk per MJ, and subcategories whole milk, semi-
skimmed milk, skimmed milk and fortified milk per MJ (all fortified milks
consumed in this study were also reduced fat milks); total cheese per
MJ and cheese subtypes (based on % fat in dry matter:42 skimmed milk
cheeses, 0–10% fat; Partially skimmed milk cheeses, 10–20% fat; Medium-
fat cheeses, 20–40% fat; Full-fat cheeses, 40–60% fat, and high-fat cheeses,
60% fat in dry matter or above). Total yogurt per MJ, total cream per
MJ and total butter per MJ were also calculated.
On the basis of the frequency of consumption of each, some variables
were collapsed into larger groups, and a final number of seven variables
representing the different dairy foods consumed were used to identify
patterns of dairy food consumption. These were: reduced fat milks, whole
milk, higher-fat cheeses, lower-fat cheeses, total cream, total butter and
total yogurt. The variables were transformed to standardised z-scores, and
a two-step clustering approach43 was taken to identify patterns. Individuals
were grouped into distinct, non-overlapping clusters, based on their dairy
food consumption, using standardised z-scores for each dairy food type,
to avoid differences simply due to variation in mean portion size.
The procedure is considered suitable for large data sets44 and can be
particularly useful in nutritional epidemiology to identify unique dietary
exposure categories.43 In the first step, small pre-clusters are created based
on a log-likelihood distance criterion. In the second step, these pre-clusters
are merged into distinct dietary groups via agglomerative hierarchical
clustering.44 A cross-validation was conducted on a random subsample
(75%) of the group to validate the clusters.
Biochemistry
A subset of the participants, n = 1136 (75.7%) provided a blood sample. For
the analyses presented here, only fasted serum samples were used.
Samples were processed in laboratories in either University College Cork
(UCC) or University College Dublin (UCD) within 5 h of collection by
centrifuging at 1570 g for 15 min at 4 oC. The resultant supernatant was
stored at − 80 oC until time of analysis. A clinical bioanalyzer (RX Daytona,
Randox
Laboratories,
Crumlin,
County
Antrim,
UK)
was
used
for
triacylglycerol (lipase/glycerol kinase colorimetric); total cholesterol (cho-
lesterol oxidase); high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (direct clearance) and
glucose (glucose oxidase). A selection of pro- and anti-inflammatory
cytokines was selected based on their association with metabolic health,
and some of these were available as part of a Metabolic Array Kit (Randox
Laboratories). Cytokines and hormones (TNF-α, interleukin2 (IL2), IL6, IL10,
insulin, leptin and C-peptide) were measured via the biochip array system
(Evidence Investigator, Randox laboratories). ELISA kits were used to
measure leptin soluble receptor (R&D Systems, Oxon, UK) and adiponectin
(ALPCO Diagnostics kit, Salem, NH, USA). All samples were run in duplicate
and cytokine concentrations were calculated from a calibration curve.
Standard quality control procedures were followed on both analysers to
ensure data integrity. Intra- and interassay coefficients of variations were
⩽ 4.9% for triacylglycerol, ⩽ 4.1% for total cholesterol, ⩽ 6.2% for HDL-
cholesterol, ⩽ 4.9% for glucose, ⩽ 7.1% for leptin soluble receptor, ⩽ 11.9%
for adiponectin, ⩽ 7.7% for TNF-α, ⩽ 11.3% for IL2, ⩽ 10.9% for IL6, ⩽ 9.3%
for IL10, ⩽ 18.5% for insulin, ⩽ 9.2% for leptin and ⩽ 11.7% for C-peptide.
Anthropometry
Weight, percentage body fat, height, waist and hip circumference were
measured by trained fieldworkers, according to standard operating
procedures.39 Weight and percentage body fat was measured in duplicate
using a Tanita SC-331S body composition analyzer (Tanita, Tokyo, Japan).

 Height was measured using the Leicester portable height measure to the
nearest 0.1 cm. Waist and hip circumferences were measured in duplicate
using a non-stretch tape to the nearest 0.1 cm. An average resting blood
pressure was calculated from triplicate measurements, with 5-min intervals
between each, using an Omron Series 5 blood pressure monitor (Omron
Healthcare, Inc., 1200 Lakeside Drive Bannockburn, IL, USA).
Statistical analyses
Differences in markers of metabolic health and differences in food and
nutrient intakes between tertiles of dairy food intake and between clusters
of dairy food intakes were analysed using analysis of covariance, adjusting
for confounding factors, such as age, gender, BMI, HEI score and mean
daily energy intake, where applicable. Χ2 analysis was used to examine
differences in the ratio of males to females between clusters. Reporting
bias was estimated using EI:BMR calculations and applying Goldberg’s
cut-off limits to identify misporting, calculated as 28·2% in this cohort, as
previously reported.40 All analyses were conducted in SPSS v20 for Mac
(IBM, New York, NY, USA).
RESULTS
A total of n = 1500 people (740 m) aged between 18 and 90 years,
took part of the study, across the age groups of 18–50, 51–64 and
⩾ 65 years (67.7%, 19.7% and 12.5%, respectively). About 70% of
the sample reported living in an urban location, and 45% listed
their
occupations
as
professional,
technical
or
managerial
categories. The overall sample was representative of the Irish
population,39 and fuller details on the demographics of the cohort
have been published elsewhere, and are also available at www.
iuna.net.
Tertiles of total dairy consumption
The mean daily intake of total dairy (milk, cheese, yogurt, butter
and cream) was 291.0 g per day (202.1 s.d). The group was divided
into tertiles of total dairy intake, designated ‘High’, ‘Medium’ and
‘Low’ (Table 1). ‘High’ consumers of total dairy, after adjustment
for energy intake, gender, age, social class and smoking, had
significantly lower BMI and % body fat, (Po0.001), a lower waist
circumference (Po0.001) and a higher insulin sensitivity score
(P = 0.001) compared with ‘low’ consumers (Table 1). ‘High’
consumers of dairy also had lower systolic (P = 0.02) and lower
diastolic blood pressure (Po0.001) and lower waist-to-hip ratio
(Po0.001) compared with the ‘medium’ and ‘low’ consumer
groups. There was no difference in fasting serum triglycerides,
HDL-C or low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol across tertiles of total
dairy intake. Of the blood biomarkers known to reflect aspects of
metabolic health that were examined, there was no association
between serum glucose, but serum insulin was significantly lower
in the higher dairy intake groups (Table 1), and insulin sensitivity
(as assessed via QUICKI) was significantly greater with increased
dairy consumption (P = 0.001). A number of other inflammatory
markers were different across the tertiles; leptin was higher in low
consumers of dairy, as was C-peptide (P = 0.04). Adiponectin and
leptin soluble receptor were both greater in the high dairy tertile
(P = 0.013 and 0.03, respectively) (Table 1).
Tertiles of total milk, yogurt and cheese consumption
To further investigate dairy intakes, individuals were grouped into
tertiles of total milk, total cheese and total yogurt intake
separately (Supplementary Tables S1–S3). Increased total milk
consumption was associated with a reduced BMI (Po0.001) and
Table 1.

 there was a trend towards higher muscle mass and lower body fat
in the highest milk consumers (P = 0.065 and P = 0.076, respec-
tively). Insulin was significantly greater in the lower milk tertile
(P = 0.02) and insulin sensitivity (QUICKI score) was greater in the
higher consumers (P = 0.002), whereas serum c-peptide signifi-
cantly greater in the low consumers (P = 0.02) (Supplementary
Table S1). IL10 concentrations trended towards being lower in
those with the greatest milk consumption (P = 0.079).
When cheese consumption was examined separately, no
differences were observed between the groups for any of markers
of metabolic health except for C-peptide, which was greater with
increasing cheese consumption (P = 0.001) (Supplementary Table
S2). High-yogurt consumers had significantly lower body fat
(P = 0.001), lower waist circumference (P = 0.025) and lower waist-
to-hip ratio (P = 0.013) than any other tertiles. Serum concentra-
tions of TNF-α were lower in the medium and high-yogurt
consumers compared with the low and the non-consumers of
yogurt also (Po0.001) (Supplementary Table S3).
Patterns of dairy consumption
To example patterns of dairy consumption, cluster analysis was
used. A two-step cluster approach resulted in a 3-cluster solution
whereby each cluster exhibited a different dairy consumption
profile. On the basis of the descriptive characteristics of the
clusters (Table 2), the three clusters were named ‘Whole milk’,
‘Butter and cream’ and ‘Reduced fat milks and yogurt’. There was
no significant difference in age across the clusters, but clusters
were all significantly different in their mean daily total dairy
intakes, energy and macronutrients. The proportion of males and
females differed significantly across the clusters, X2(2) = 43.2,
n = 1147, Po0.001. ‘Whole milk drinkers’ had a greater proportion
of men than women (M:F, 58:42), whereas there were more
women in the ‘Reduced fat milks and yogurt’ cluster (M:F, 41:59).
The proportion of males to females in the ‘Butter and cream’
cluster was more evenly spread at a ratio of 46:54 (Table 2).
To examine the effect of energy misreporting on the clusters,
and as a further validation measure, the analysis was run again
with the potential energy misreporters removed. Clustering on
this smaller cohort (n = 864) resulted in four clusters of dairy food
intakes. These patterns were similar to those observed in the
larger group, where all reporters were analysed, except that the
‘Reduced fat milks and yogurt’ cluster appeared to form two
separate, smaller clusters of individuals (of ‘Yogurt’ and ‘Reduced
fat milk’.
Cluster membership was broadly similar, with between 68 and
94% of people remaining in their original clusters; thus the
remaining results are presented for the full cohort of people.
(Of the 32% that moved from ‘Reduced fat milks and yogurt’ they
moved mainly into ‘Yogurt’ or ‘Reduced fat milks’, meaning that
the patterns identified were still overall quite similar). Those in the
‘Whole milk’ cluster consumed an average of 80.6 g of total fat
daily, which was similar to the ‘Butter and cream’ cluster (80.7 g
per day, 26.8 g s.d.), but considerably higher than the 67.5 g fat
per day consumed by the ‘Reduced fat milks and yogurt’ cluster.
The ‘Whole milk’, and ‘Butter and cream’ clusters also had similar
intakes of SFA at 32.2 g per day each. Mean daily SFA intakes in
the ‘Whole milk’, and ‘Butter and cream’ clusters were significantly
greater than the ‘Reduced fat milks and yogurt’ cluster, whose SFA
intakes were 25.7 g daily, on average. Percent energy from SFA

 was also higher in these two groups than in the ‘Reduced fat milks
and yogurt’ cluster at 13.8% and 14% vs 12.2%.
Those in the ‘Reduced fat milks and yogurt’ cluster were more
likely to be female (Po0.001), and had a lower mean daily energy
intake than the other two clusters (7.9 MJ vs 8.7 MJ and 8.8 MJ).
The ‘Reduced fat milks and yogurt’ cluster also consumed more of
their daily energy from protein than the other clusters (17.8 vs
16.4% in the ‘Whole milk’ cluster and 16.5% in the ‘Butter and
cream’ cluster). The total milk consumption was highest in the
‘Reduced fat milks and yogurt’ cluster, at 33 g per MJ energy
intake, but this figure was mostly due to skimmed and semi-
skimmed milk, whereas whole-milk intake was very low in this
cluster. Total cheese intake was similar across the clusters, but
whole-milk drinkers consumed more of the higher-fat cheeses
than the ‘Butter and cream’ cluster or the ‘Reduced fat milks and
yogurt’ cluster (1.8 g per MJ vs 0.8 and 1.1 g), whereas the
‘Reduced fat milks and yogurt’ cluster consumed more of the
lower-fat cheeses.
To examine the rest of the diet consumed within these clusters,
the non-dairy foods consumed were grouped into one of eight
food groups, and the percentage contribution to energy from
each food group was calculated in each of the three clusters
(Supplementary Table S4). There was no difference across the
clusters in the percentage energy derived from ‘Biscuits, cakes
& pastries’ or from ‘Savoury snacks and confectionary’ or ‘Meat,
fish and their dishes’ (after adjustment for multiple comparisons).
‘Rice, grains, breads and cereals’ were higher in the ‘Reduced fat
milks and yogurt’ cluster. Percent energy from ‘Beverages’ and
‘Potato products’ was higher in the whole-milk group. Percent
energy from ‘Fruit and vegetables’ was higher in the ‘Reduced fat
milks and yogurt’ cluster, as was the energy from ‘Milk, cheese and
yogurt’. Percent energy from ‘Dairy, and dairy-containing recipes’
was higher in the ‘Butter and cream cluster’ (Supplementary Table
S4). Tertiles of individual dairy components were cross-tabulated
with the dairy intake clusters (Supplementary Table S5), and
Χ2 analyses verified that the three clusters were significantly
different in terms of their spread across the tertiles, demonstrating
distinctly different patterns of dairy food intakes and supporting
the use of clustering to identify patterns of dairy food intake.
A HEI variable, based on published dietary indices,41 was
examined in relation to dairy tertiles, and to dairy food clusters,
adjusting for age, gender and energy intake. The score did not
differ across tertiles of total dairy, yet when the clusters were
examined, there was a significant difference in the HEI score
across clusters (Po0.001) (Table 3). The ‘Reduced fat milks and
Yogurt’ cluster had a significantly higher mean HEI score, and
significantly lower SFA intakes than the other clusters (Po0.001)
(Table 3). Despite this, there were few differences observed in the
markers of metabolic health across the different dairy clusters
(Table 3) —TNF-α was significantly higher in the ‘Whole milk’
cluster compared with the other clusters (P = 0.018)— serum
triglycerides and total cholesterol were lower in the ‘Whole milk’
and ‘Butter and cream’ clusters than in the ‘Reduced milk and
yogurt’ cluster (P = 0.028 and P = 0.015, respectively).
DISCUSSION
The aim of this analysis was to examine consumption of dairy food
intakes and metabolic health, looking both at intakes of individual
dairy foods, and patterns of dairy foods in the adult population of
Table 3.

Patterns of dairy intake and metabolic health

 Ireland. Total dairy intake was associated with lower measures of
body fatness, including waist-to-hip ratio. A similar relationship
was observed for total milk consumption, and for yogurt, although
no differences in various metabolic health markers were observed
across levels of cheese intake. These results are supported by a
recent review, where authors concluded that dairy consumption
has a modest, positive effect with respect to body weight and
body
fatness.45
In this
cohort,
total
dairy
and
total
milk
consumption (which included whole- and reduced fat milks) was
associated with lower circulating levels of some inflammatory
biomarkers, with greater levels of adiponectin, and with increased
insulin sensitivity, after adjustment for BMI, age, gender, energy
intake, social class and smoking. Conversely, IL10, an anti-
inflammatory marker, trended towards being higher in the low-
milk consumers. These findings are largely in agreement with a
number of previous studies that have observed an association
between dairy intakes and circulating inflammatory markers46–48
and points to a potential role for milk in metabolic syndrome
prevention or management.
Total dairy intake was also associated with a reduction in blood
pressure. This finding is in agreement with the findings of
Livingstone et al.,49 where a prospective analysis on the Caerphilly
study demonstrated that augmentation index, an measure of
arterial stiffness, was lower in those with the greatest dairy intake.
When individual foods were examined, high-milk consumers in
that study had a 10.4 mm Hg lower systolic blood pressure than
non-consumers of milk, whereas butter intake in the same cohort
was associated with a greater systolic blood pressure, demonstrat-
ing the importance of examining the overall patterns of dairy food
consumption
in addition
to individual
foods.
The lack of
observations between blood pressure and dairy products other
than milk observed within our study could potentially be due to
milk being the most widely consumed dairy product and at the
greatest quantities within this cohort, and therefore similar
analyses should be performed in much larger studies to examine
whether other dairy products are also implicated. Increased total
yogurt consumption was associated with significantly lower levels
of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFA, a result that is keeping with
studies showing that yogurt consumption, potentially via lactic
acid bacterial stimulation, may modulate cytokine production.50–52
‘Total yogurt’ here included drinking yogurts, some of which could
be classified as probiotic drinking yogurts, which may have partly
accounted for this result.
Cheese consumption was not associated with any measures of
body fatness, or with many of the markers of metabolic health in
this cohort, although C-peptide was higher in the higher
consumers of cheese, and QUICKI, a measure of insulin sensitivity,
trended towards being higher in the higher cheese consumers.
C-peptide is associated with insulin sensitivity; these results
together suggesting that cheese intake could be associated with
improved insulin sensitivity in this cohort. Cheese consumers also
had greater percentage energy from fat and from SFA than non-
consumers, although blood lipid profiles did not differ across
tertiles of cheese intake. The absence of association between
cheese consumption and blood lipid profiles observed within this
analysis is also in agreement with several recent intervention
studies, which suggest that the SFA, consumed within the matrix
of cheese, may not adversely impact blood lipid profiles.11,13,32,53
Differences in the calcium contents of different dairy products,33
and differences in sphingolipid content,31 are two of the
hypotheses that have been put forward to explain these
phenomena in previous studies. Further research is required to
fully understand the underlying mechanisms of the differences
between butter, cream, cheese and milk in their cholesterol-
raising abilities.
To our knowledge, this paper represents the first analysis where
patterns of dairy food intakes have been examined in relation to
metabolic health markers. Three main patterns of dairy food
consumption were observed in this cohort—whole-milk consu-
mers, reduced fat milk and yogurt consumers, and cream and
butter consumers. The high level of agreement between the two
cluster analyses conducted (the first using all reporters and the
second using acceptable reporters only) indicates that the clusters
of dairy consumption identified here are relatively stable across
reporting types in this cohort. Mean daily fat intakes (total and
saturated) were significantly lower in the ‘Reduced fat milks and
yogurt’ cluster. However, unexpectedly, triglycerides and total
cholesterol were higher in this group than in the ‘Butter and
cream’ and the ‘Whole milk’ cluster. One possibility for this result is
that these individuals may have been following advice to
consume reduced fat dairy, perhaps in response to cholesterol
concerns or other reasons. However, as the results presented were
adjusted for age, gender, HEI score and BMI differences, which
would also be associated with these risks, this seems unlikely.
Another potential explanation is that this could be partly due to
the higher sphingolipid content of cream,54 since as mentioned
above, recent evidence suggests that this may affect the impact of
the SFA on the blood lipid profile.31 Alternatively, the ‘Reduced fat
milks and yogurt’ consumers may also have been higher
consumers of other foods not fully captured by the 11 food
groupings used here, and it is possible that some other dietary
factor could have resulted in the higher serum triglycerides and
total cholesterol observed, such as the percentage energy from
carbohydrate. The clusters were based on the patterns of actual
intake, which were categorised based on fat content, whereas the
tertiles did not distinguish between fat content. Individuals in the
‘Reduced fat milks and yogurt’ cluster had significantly greater %
energy from the food group ‘Rice, grains, breads and cereals’
(Supplementary Table S4), and a higher triglyceride level. This is
consistent with evidence that suggests that increased carbohy-
drate in the diet is associated with increases triglyceride levels,
for example,55 which could explain this otherwise seemingly
anomalous result.
Dietary pattern analysis offers considerable advantage over
examining tertiles of consumption alone, as it examines intakes in
the context of overall food intake, and allows for the identification
of patterns rather than single foods or nutrients in isolation.
Examining intakes via both methods within a cohort offers a more
holistic overview of the impact of dairy intake and health markers.
A HEI variable, based on published dietary indices,41 was
examined in relation to dairy tertiles, and to clusters, adjusting for
age, gender and energy intake. The score did not differ across
tertiles of total dairy, yet when the clusters were examined, there
was a significant difference in the HEI score across clusters
(Table 3), demonstrating that the cluster analysis captures a more
encompassing image of dietary intakes than tertile analysis alone.
It should also be noted that although the figures were adjusted for
differences in the AHEI score in order to account for other aspects
of the diet, the AHEI is based on multiple factors. For example, the
HEI used here assigned a value for trans fat intake among others.
However, the food source of that fat is not considered, meaning
that this could result in higher healthy eating scores for those with
lower dairy fat, although trans fat intakes were generally low
overall. The adjustment, here, for HEI score may not have fully
accounted for the differences in energy from carbohydrate.
Despite the differences observed for metabolic health markers
across tertiles of individual dairy components, few differences
were observed across the clusters, even after adjustment for the
HEI. Of note, total cholesterol and triglycerides were higher in the
‘Reduced fat milk and yogurts’ cluster. This was surprising,
considering the tertile results for yogurt. Overall this suggests
that although some dairy foods were associated with favourable
outcomes when considered in isolation, when the patterns of
intakes were considered in their entirety, the resultant blood lipid
profiles from reduced fat dairy appear less favourable when eaten
as part of a low-fat, high-carbohydrate dietary pattern. Recently,
Patterns of dairy intake and metabolic health
EL Feeney et al
6
Nutrition & Diabetes (2017) 1 – 8
 the link between SFA and metabolic health has been revisited,
and these results would appear to agree with some of the most
recent findings, as the ‘Butter and cream’ and ‘Whole milk’
clusters, despite having greater fat intakes and SFA intakes, do not
have adverse blood lipid profiles. One limitation of the present
work is the fact that fasting blood samples were not obtained for
every subject, which left a much smaller cohort of individuals in
which to examine biochemistry. Due to the differences in the
number of participants that fall within the different dairy food
clusters, it is important that this work be repeated in larger cohorts
to determine whether these observations translate to other
population groups. Another potential limitation of the work
includes the fact that the AHEI score also includes percentage
energy from trans fat as one of the nine components without
accounting for the food source of the fat. However, if anything, as
dairy fat is a significant source of dietary trans fat being able to
account for the food source could have lead to an even more
positive outcome for the higher-fat dairy groups, as they would
have received a lower HEI score based on this component.
CONCLUSION
This study applies the concept of dietary pattern analysis to
understanding dairy food intakes and allows for the exploration of
patterns of dairy food intakes with differing fat contents. Here we
show that clear and robust patterns of dairy food intake exist in
the Irish population. The results of the tertile analysis suggest that
dairy foods overall may offer potential for weight management,
particularly milk and yogurt. Dairy foods, principally milk, may also
have a role in the control of blood pressure, and potentially in the
management of blood glucose. Cheese consumption was not
associated with adverse lipid profiles, measures of body fatness or
other markers of metabolic health in this cohort. Although greater
overall dairy food consumption, driven mainly by milk and yogurt,
was associated with more favourable body weight status, no
single pattern of dairy food consumption stood out as having an
overall healthier profile in this reportedly healthy population
sample, when actual patterns of intake were examined. In fact, a
‘Reduced fat milks and yogurt’ pattern was associated with higher
triglycerides. As this cluster consumed a lower percentage energy
from fat, and a higher percentage energy from grains, this
suggests that the food intake pattern associated with low fat high
carbohydrate may be less healthy than other patterns. More
research is needed to better understand this result.
The results presented here demonstrate the importance of
considering not only intakes of discrete foods, but also the
patterns in which they are consumed in the diet, particularly in
relation to dairy food intake patterns. Due to the current debate
over dietary sources of SFA, the application of this concept to
larger data sets, including ‘at-risk’ cohorts, is warranted.
