BACKGROUND
The effect of procalcitonin-guided use of antibiotics on treatment for suspected lower 
respiratory tract infection is unclear.
METHODS
In 14 U.S. hospitals with high adherence to quality measures for the treatment of 
pneumonia, we provided guidance for clinicians about national clinical practice rec-
ommendations for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections and the interpre-
tation of procalcitonin assays. We then randomly assigned patients who presented to 
the emergency department with a suspected lower respiratory tract infection and for 
whom the treating physician was uncertain whether antibiotic therapy was indicated 
to one of two groups: the procalcitonin group, in which the treating clinicians were 
provided with real-time initial (and serial, if the patient was hospitalized) procalci-
tonin assay results and an antibiotic use guideline with graded recommendations 
based on four tiers of procalcitonin levels, or the usual-care group. We hypothesized 
that within 30 days after enrollment the total antibiotic-days would be lower — and 
the percentage of patients with adverse outcomes would not be more than 4.5 percent-
age points higher — in the procalcitonin group than in the usual-care group.
RESULTS
A total of 1656 patients were included in the final analysis cohort (826 randomly 
assigned to the procalcitonin group and 830 to the usual-care group), of whom 782 
(47.2%) were hospitalized and 984 (59.4%) received antibiotics within 30 days. The 
treating clinician received procalcitonin assay results for 792 of 826 patients (95.9%) 
in the procalcitonin group (median time from sample collection to assay result, 77 
minutes) and for 18 of 830 patients (2.2%) in the usual-care group. In both groups, 
the procalcitonin-level tier was associated with the decision to prescribe antibiotics 
in the emergency department. There was no significant difference between the pro-
calcitonin group and the usual-care group in antibiotic-days (mean, 4.2 and 4.3 days, 
respectively; difference, −0.05 day; 95% confidence interval [CI], −0.6 to 0.5; P 
= 
0.87) 
or the proportion of patients with adverse outcomes (11.7% [96 patients] and 13.1% 
[109 patients]; difference, −1.5 percentage points; 95% CI, −4.6 to 1.7; P<0.001 for 
noninferiority) within 30 days.
CONCLUSIONS
The provision of procalcitonin assay results, along with instructions on their interpre-
tation, to emergency department and hospital-based clinicians did not result in less 
use of antibiotics than did usual care among patients with suspected lower respiratory 
tract infection. (Funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences; ProACT

T
he overuse of antibiotic agents is a 
public health problem1 associated with in-
creased health care costs and antibiotic 
resistance.2 Overuse of antibiotics is common in 
infections of the lower respiratory tract, where 
bacterial and viral infections manifest similarly.3-5 
Procalcitonin is a peptide with levels that are more 
typically elevated in bacterial than in viral infec-
tions6,7; the magnitude of the elevation correlates 
with the severity of infection,8,9 and decreasing 
levels over time correlate with the resolution of in-
fection.10 Several European trials have tested wheth-
er procalcitonin assay results, folded into an anti-
biotic prescription guideline, curbed the use of 
antibiotics in suspected lower respiratory tract 
infection.11-14 These trials showed that procalcito-
nin-based guidance reduced the use of antibiotics 
with no apparent harm, and in February 2017, on 
the basis of a meta-analysis of these and other 
trials, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
approved a procalcitonin assay to help guide the 
starting or stopping of antibiotic treatment in 
suspected lower respiratory tract infection in the 
emergency department or hospital.15,16
However, the applicability of these data to 
routine practice is unclear. In the largest trial, 
physicians could overrule procalcitonin guide-
line recommendations only after consulting with 
the coordinating center, for critical illness, or for 
legionella infection.11,17 National authorities and 
medical societies reached varying conclusions 
about procalcitonin-guided antibiotic prescription 
in suspected lower respiratory tract infection, rang-
ing from findings of moderate-strength evidence 
of benefit and low-strength evidence of not caus-
ing harm18 to recommendations against routine 
use.19,20 Few studies were conducted in the United 
States,21,22 where prescribing patterns may differ 
from those in Europe. We conducted a multicenter 
trial to assess whether a procalcitonin antibiotic 
prescribing guideline, implemented for the treat-
ment of suspected lower respiratory tract infec-
tion with reproducible strategies, would result in 
less exposure to antibiotics than usual care, with-
out a significantly higher rate of adverse events.
Methods
Trial Oversight
We conducted the Procalcitonin Antibiotic Consen-
sus Trial (ProACT), a patient-level, 1:1 randomized 
trial, in 14 hospitals in the United States. The trial 
design and rationale have been published previ-
ously.23 The University of Pittsburgh and all site 
institutional review boards approved the protocol, 
which is available with the full text of this article 
at NEJM.org. The National Institute of General 
Medical Sciences funded the trial and convened 
an independent data and safety monitoring board 
(see the Supplementary Appendix, available at 
NEJM.org). ProACT was coordinated by the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Clinical Research, Investi-
gation, and Systems Modeling of Acute Illness 
Center and the Multidisciplinary Acute Care Re-
search Organization. Procalcitonin assays and 
laboratory training were provided by bioMérieux, 
which had no other role in the trial. The investi-
gators remained unaware of the outcomes in each 
trial group until data lock in October 2017. The 
authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness 
of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the 
protocol.
Sites and Patients
The sites were predominantly urban academic 
hospitals that had a high level of adherence to Joint 
Commission pneumonia core measures,24 and 
none used procalcitonin in routine care. We en-
rolled adult patients (≥18 years old) in the emer-
gency department for whom the treating clinician 
had given an initial diagnosis of acute lower re-
spiratory tract infection (<28 days in duration) 
but had not yet decided to give or withhold anti-
biotics and about whom there was uncertainty 
regarding the need for antibiotics, such that 
procalcitonin data could influence the prescrib-
ing decision. Using baseline characteristics and 
published criteria, we categorized the initial diag-
nosis of lower respiratory tract infection into final 
diagnoses of acute exacerbation of chronic ob-
structive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma exac-
erbation, acute bronchitis, community-acquired 
pneumonia, and other.11,13,25-31 The definitions and 
exclusion criteria are provided in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix, and full details of the trial are 
provided in the protocol and statistical analysis 
plan. All the patients or their authorized repre-
sentatives provided written informed consent.
Trial Interventions
In both treatment groups, clinicians retained au-
tonomy regarding care decisions. We disseminat-
ed national antibiotic guidelines for lower respira-
tory tract infection and the procalcitonin antibiotic

Procalcitonin-Guided Use of Antibiotics
prescribing guideline (Fig. S1 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix) in all promotional tools and train-
ing meetings.
In the procalcitonin group, the intervention 
consisted of measuring and reporting the procal-
citonin assay results and providing the procalcito-
nin guideline to aid the treating clinicians in their 
interpretation of the results. We measured procal-
citonin using a rapid assay with an analytic range 
of 0.05 to 200 μg per liter (VIDAS B.R.A.H.M.S 
Procalcitonin, bioMérieux). The guideline used 
the same cutoff values as had been used previ-
ously and approved by the FDA (i.e., with antibiot-
ics strongly discouraged for procalcitonin levels 
<0.1 μg per liter, discouraged for levels 0.1 to 
0.25 μg per liter, recommended for levels >0.25 
to 0.5 μg per liter, and strongly recommended 
for levels >0.5 μg per liter). We obtained blood 
samples for procalcitonin measurement in the 
emergency department, and if the patient was hos-
pitalized, 6 to 24 hours later and on days 3, 5, and 
7, if the patient was still in the hospital and re-
ceiving antibiotics.
We used a multifaceted implementation ap-
proach to mimic how a hospital might typically 
deploy quality-improvement measures when intro-
ducing a new intervention (see the Supplementary 
Appendix). Before the launch of the trial, the site 
principal investigators sent letters to local primary 
care providers with a synopsis of the trial. We pro-
moted the rapid delivery of information about 
procalcitonin to the treating clinicians by track-
ing delivery times, providing feedback to sites, 
coordinating the collection of blood samples for 
the trial with routine morning draws, and em-
bedding the results and guideline into the sites’ 
electronic health records when feasible (Table S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix). If antibiotics 
were administered when the procalcitonin level 
was 0.25 μg per liter or lower, the site coordina-
tor queried the treating clinician and recorded the 
reasons for nonadherence; the coordinators did 
not ask the clinicians any other questions. We 
reviewed all cases of nonadherence with the site 
principal investigators. On discharge, we provid-
ed patients with a letter for their primary care 
provider that included their last procalcitonin 
assay result, a synopsis of the trial, and the pro-
calcitonin guideline.
In the usual-care group, we drew blood at en-
rollment for procalcitonin measurement using the 
same assay, but the results were clinically unavail-
able. Trial personnel had no bedside role other 
than the collection of data and blood samples.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was total antibiotic expo-
sure, defined as the total number of antibiotic-
days within 30 days after enrollment. We defined 
an antibiotic-day as any day on which a partici-
pant received any oral or intravenous antibacterial 
agent. Our primary safety outcome was a compos-
ite of adverse outcomes that could be attributable 
to withholding antibiotics in lower respiratory tract 
infection, within 30 days after enrollment (Table 
S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Secondary 
outcomes included prescription of antibiotics in 
the emergency department, antibiotic receipt by 
day 30, antibiotic-days during the hospital stay 
(among patients who were admitted), admission 
to the intensive care unit, subsequent emergency 
department visits by day 30, and quality of life 
as assessed with the Airway Questionnaire 20.32 
We obtained data through chart review performed 
by site research staff and by telephone calls at 
days 15 and 30 made by coordinating center staff 
who were unaware of the treatment-group as-
signments. We collected data on serious adverse 
events in accordance with federal guidelines.33
Statistical Analysis
We analyzed all data according to the intention-
to-treat principle. We used multiple imputations 
with chained equations for missing outcome data, 
combined with the use of Rubin’s method.34 For 
the primary outcome, we hypothesized that pro-
calcitonin-guided antibiotic prescription would be 
superior to usual care and compared the mean 
number of antibiotic-days between groups using 
two-sample t-tests. For the primary safety out-
come, we hypothesized that procalcitonin-guid-
ed antibiotic prescription would be noninferior to 
usual care, on the basis of a confidence interval 
based on a normal distribution for the difference 
in proportions between groups. The primary ef-
ficacy and safety outcomes were considered as 
coprimary in the design, and significant results 
for both would be required to declare “success” 
for the intervention. We initially determined that 
with 1514 patients, the trial would have at least 
80% power to both detect a between-group dif-
ference of 1 antibiotic-day and to declare nonin-
feriority on the basis of a predefined noninferi-
ority margin of 4.5 percentage points, with an

overall alpha of 0.05, two interim analyses, an as-
sumed 11% rate of adverse outcomes in the usual-
care group,8,35 and 10% loss to follow-up. At the 
second interim analysis in April 2017, the loss to 
follow-up was 18%, and the data and safety moni-
toring board approved an increase in enrollment 
to 1664 patients.
In accordance with CONSORT (Consolidated 
Standards of Reporting Trials) recommendations 
for noninferiority trials,36 we conducted a per-pro-
tocol analysis in which the intervention group was 
restricted to patients for whom the trial interven-
tion (i.e., measuring and reporting the procalcito-
nin results and providing the procalcitonin guide-
line) was achieved at all time points. To explore 
the effect of the intervention when clinicians con-
sistently followed the procalcitonin guideline, we 
conducted a per-guideline analysis in which the 
intervention group was restricted to patients for 
whom clinicians adhered to guideline recommen-
dations at all time points. The per-protocol analy-
sis had the potential to be affected by selection 
bias due to inherent differences between cases in 
which the protocol was fully executed and those 
in which it was not; this was also true for the per-
guideline analysis for cases in which the clinician 
was adherent and those in which the clinician was 
nonadherent.37 We therefore applied instrumental-
variable estimation to both analyses, using the 
randomized assignment as the instrument.38,39
We conducted two sensitivity analyses to assess 
robustness to missing data: a complete-case analy-
sis, under an assumption that data were missing 
at random, and a missing-not-at-random analysis, 
in which all missing data were imputed from the 
usual-care group.40 We conducted prespecified 
subgroup analyses of final diagnostic category, 
age, sex, ethnic group, and race. After unblinding 
of the data, we performed post hoc analyses to 
gain an understanding of the primary results. We 
plotted antibiotic prescription in the emergency 
department, initial presentation and outcomes, 
and intervention effect according to initial pro-
calcitonin-level tier, as well as antibiotic exposure 
over time. To adjust for multiple comparisons, 
we applied a Bonferroni correction and present 
99.86% confidence intervals for the 36 second-
ary antibiotic-exposure comparisons. We conduct-
ed the analyses with R Open software, version 
3.4.2 (Microsoft), and SAS software, version 9.4 
(SAS Institute). The complete statistical analysis 
plan is provided in the protocol.
Results
Patients
From November 2014 through May 2017, a total 
of 1664 patients were enrolled and underwent 
randomization; 8 requested withdrawal (4 in each 
group), leaving a final analysis cohort of 1656 
patients (826 in the procalcitonin group and 830 
in the usual-care group). A total of 1430 patients 
(86.4%) completed follow-up: 1345 (81.2%) com-
pleted 30-day follow-up, and 85 (5.1%) completed 
15-day follow-up only (Fig. 1). Baseline charac-
teristics were similar among patients for whom 
complete 30-day data were available and those 
with incomplete data (Table S2 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix), as well as in the two treatment 
groups (Table 1).
Final diagnoses, which were available for 1645 
of the patients, included asthma exacerbation 
(646 patients, 39.3%), acute exacerbation of COPD 
(524, 31.9%), acute bronchitis (398, 24.2%), and 
community-acquired pneumonia (328, 19.9%). 
The initial procalcitonin level, available for 1596 
patients, was less than 0.1 μg per liter in 1236 
(77.4%), 0.1 to 0.25 μg per liter in 230 (14.4%), 
more than 0.25 to 0.5 μg per liter in 50 (3.1%), 
and more than 0.5 μg per liter in 80 (5.0%). A 
total of 782 patients (47.2%) were hospitalized, 
604 (36.5%) received antibiotics in the emergency 
department, and 984 (59.4%) received antibiotics 
within 30 days. The initial procalcitonin-level 
tier was associated with the presence of system-
atic inflammatory response criteria and with the 
clinician’s estimation, based on clinical features 
only, that the cause of illness was bacterial (Ta-
ble S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Protocol Adherence
In the emergency department, procalcitonin as-
say results were obtained and reported to the 
treating clinician for 792 of 826 patients (95.9%) 
assigned to the procalcitonin group (median time 
from sample collection to assay result, 77 min-
utes). For 18 of 826 patients (2.2%), a blood 
sample was not obtained, and 16 patients (1.9%) 
left the emergency department before the results 
could be reported. For the entire protocol peri-
od, 696 patients (84.3%) had all procalcitonin 
results obtained and reported at all time points, 
67 (8.1%) had all but one, 20 (2.4%) had all but 
two, and 9 (1.1%) had more than two missing 
results. In the usual-care group, 18 of 830 pa-

tients (2.2%) underwent procalcitonin testing as 
part of clinical care.
Procalcitonin Guideline Adherence
In the emergency department, clinicians adhered 
to the procalcitonin guideline recommendation for 
577 of 792 patients (72.9%) in the procalcitonin 
group for whom results were obtained and re-
ported. For the entire protocol period, clinicians 
adhered to all procalcitonin guideline recom-
mendations at all time points for 513 of 792 
patients (64.8%) (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Adherence to the guideline among 
clinicians was stable throughout the trial (rate of 
complete guideline adherence for each third of 
the trial period, 66.8%, 59.8%, and 67.8%; P 
= 
0.11)

A patient could have had more than one reason for exclusion. Mixed modeling was used to impute missing data for 
the intention-to-treat analysis of the primary outcome. Fifteen patients who were found to be ineligible after enroll-
ment were retained in the intention-to-treat analysis of the primary outcome; the reasons for ineligibility were previ-
ous receipt of antibiotics (7 patients), homelessness (2), enrollment in the Procalcitonin Antibiotic Consensus Trial 
(ProACT) in the past 30 days (1), severe immunosuppression (1), current long-term dialysis (1), metastatic cancer 
(1), and site logistic issues (2). A total of 27 patients who completed the 30-day follow-up could not recall their use 
of antibiotics. LAR denotes legally authorized representative.

and varied according to final diagnosis (asthma

most common reasons were clinician belief that 
a bacterial infection was present (183 time points, 
39.3%), clinician belief that the patient had an 
acute COPD exacerbation requiring antibiotics 
(158 time points, 33.9%), and prescription oc-
curring before the procalcitonin result was avail-
able (92 time points, 19.7%).
Outcomes
In the intention-to-treat analysis, there was no 
significant difference in antibiotic exposure dur-
ing the first 30 days between the procalcitonin 
group and the usual-care group (mean antibiot-
ic-days, 4.2 and 4.3 days, respectively; difference, 
−0.05 day; 95% confidence interval [CI], −0.6 to 
0.5; P 
= 
0.87) (Fig. 2 and Table 2). The results were 
similar in the per-protocol analysis (difference, 
−0.1 day; 95% CI, −0.7 to 0.6), per-guideline analy-
sis (−0.1 day; 95% CI, −1.0 to 0.8), complete-case 
analysis (−0.1 day; 95% CI, −0.7 to 0.5), and miss-
ing-not-at-random analysis (−0.1 day; 95% CI,

−0.7 to 0.5). There was no significant difference 
in antibiotic-days by day 30 in any prespecified 
subgroup analysis (Table 2, and Table S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
By 30 days, 96 patients in the procalcitonin 
group (11.7%) and 109 patients in the usual-care 
group (13.1%) had incurred a safety outcome event 
in the intention-to-treat analysis; the 95% confi-
dence interval for the −1.5-percentage-point differ-
ence in risk (−4.6 to 1.7) excluded the prespecified 
noninferiority margin of 4.5 percentage points 
(P<0.001 for noninferiority) (Table S5 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). The results were similar in 
the per-protocol, per-guideline, complete-case, and 
missing-not-at-random analyses, as well as across 
the prespecified subgroups.
In the analysis of secondary outcomes, there 
was no significant difference between the pro-
calcitonin group and the usual-care group in the 
percentage of patients receiving any antibiotics 
within 30 days (57.0% and 61.8%, respectively; 
risk difference, −4.8 percentage points; 99.86% 
CI, −12.7 to 3.0), the percentage of patients receiv-
ing an antibiotic prescription in the emergency 
department (34.1% and 38.7%; risk difference, 
−4.6 percentage points; 99.86% CI, −12.2 to 3.0), 
or the mean hospital antibiotic-days among hos-
pitalized patients (2.6 and 2.7 days; risk differ-
ence −0.1; 99.86% CI, −0.8 to 0.6) (Table 2). 
However, for acute bronchitis, the proportion of 
patients receiving an antibiotic prescription in 
the emergency department was lower in the pro-
calcitonin group than in the usual-care group 
(17.3% vs. 32.1%; risk difference, −14.8 percent-
age points; 99.86% CI, −28.5 to −1.1).
For the incidence of individual outcomes of 
the composite safety outcome, admission to the 
intensive care unit, and subsequent emergency 
department visits, the 95% confidence interval 
of the differences in risk between the groups 
excluded the prespecified noninferiority margin 
of 4.5 percentage points, with upper limits rang-
ing from 0.1 to 3.9 percentage points (Tables S5 
and S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
rates of death and organ failure were low in both 
groups, ranging from 0.5% to 2.6%. Hospital 
readmission was the most common individual 
adverse outcome and accounted for 132 of 205 
adverse outcomes (64.4%); the rates were similar 
in the two treatment groups (7.6% in the procal-
citonin group and 8.5% in the usual-care group). 
There was also no significant difference in qual-
ity of life between the groups. The rate of serious 
adverse events did not differ between the groups, 
and none of the events were judged by the site 
principal investigator as being related to the trial. 
Additional details are provided in Tables S5, S6, 
and S7 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Post hoc analyses showed a possible interac-
tion between treatment group and initial procal-
citonin-level tier (P 
= 
0.02 for the interaction 
term). Although the observed rates of antibiotic 
exposure were lower in the procalcitonin group 
than in the usual-care group among patients in 
the second procalcitonin-level tier (i.e., 0.1 to 0.25 
μg per liter) (Table S8 and Fig. S3 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix) and in the combined emer-
gency department and hospital period, these dif-
ferences were not significant (Fig. 3). A total of 
82.6% of patients in the trial population pre-
sented in the lowest and highest procalcitonin 
tiers, which are accompanied by the strongest 
recommendations, yet the rates of antibiotic pre-
scription were similar in the two groups (Fig. S3 
in the Supplementary Appendix). In addition, in 
both treatment groups, the rate of prescription of 
antibiotics increased with procalcitonin-level tier 
(Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).

Procalcitonin-Guided Use of Antibiotics
Discussion
In this multicenter trial, the use of a procalcito-
nin-guided antibiotic prescription guideline did 
not result in less exposure to antibiotics than did 
usual care among patients presenting to the 
emergency department with suspected lower re-
spiratory tract infection. There are several pos-
sible explanations for this finding. In the usual-
care group, even when clinicians did not know 
the procalcitonin assay result, they prescribed 
antibiotics less frequently to patients in the lower 
procalcitonin-level tiers than to those in the 
higher tiers. Patients with lower procalcitonin 
levels also had fewer clinical features of infec-
tion, and in that context, procalcitonin probably 
provided a modest amount of additional infor-
mation to guide decisions. There was some sug-
gestion of heterogeneity of the effect of the in-
tervention, such as lower antibiotic prescription 
rates for patients with acute bronchitis than for 
those with other final diagnoses and a possible 
interaction between treatment effect and procal-
citonin tier. However, these secondary analyses 
were exploratory, and the differences were large-
ly nonsignificant.
Our findings contrast with those of previous 
trials of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic pre-
scription in suspected lower respiratory tract 
infection. Possible reasons include differences in 
case mix, design, and setting. Previously, the 
largest effects on minimizing antibiotic expo-
sure were observed among patients without 
pneumonia.11,42 We enrolled a high proportion of 
such patients, most of whom had low procalci-
tonin levels, which provided ample opportunity 
to detect an effect of the intervention on antibi-
otic exposure. Adherence to the procalcitonin 
guideline in previous trials was heavily man-
dated. We deployed the intervention using qual-
ity-improvement principles, including extensive 
use of education, prompts, and feedback. This 
design mimics a best-case scenario for deploy-
ment of a new intervention in the U.S. health 
care setting, but it probably yields lower clini-
cian adherence than previous strategies. We ac-
counted for this possibility by increasing the 
power of the trial to detect smaller effects; in 
addition, a per-guideline analysis that was re-
stricted to patients for whom clinicians had fol-
lowed the procalcitonin guideline at all time 
points and in which we controlled for selection 
bias yielded results similar to those in the pri-
mary intention-to-treat analysis. In the decade 
since the largest previous trial completed enroll-
ment,11 there has been increased attention to 
antibiotic overuse and stewardship43 and move-
ment toward shorter courses of antibiotic treat-
ment based on evidence44 and guidelines.45 Such 
shifts in practice may have resulted in less op-
portunity for the intervention we examined to 
further reduce antibiotic exposure.
We considered whether the usual-care group 
may have received antibiotics at too low a rate, 
running the risk of unwanted recrudescence of 
infection. However, complications such as the 
development of organ dysfunction were infre-
quent, and the rates of adverse outcomes were 
lower than in other trials involving lower respi-
ratory tract infection.46-48 Taken together, we 
presume that our findings can be attributed to 
the fact that the procalcitonin-based prescribing 
guideline provided fewer opportunities to change 
antibiotic decisions than in previous trials, both 
because clinicians in the usual-care group al-
ready commonly withheld antibiotics during 
emergency department and hospital encounters 
and because decisions to initially withhold anti-
biotics on the basis of procalcitonin level were 
subsequently overruled in the outpatient setting.
Strengths of our trial design included the fact 
that we ensured that serial procalcitonin results 
were delivered to clinicians in multiple emer-
gency departments and hospitals, and we con-
ducted the trial in a setting in which best prac-
tice based on current guidelines was promoted 
and in which background procalcitonin use was 
minimal. We also recruited patients for whom 
clinicians had uncertainty regarding the benefit 
of antibiotics, a feature that previous trials were 
criticized for lacking,49,50 and the trial was well 
powered to detect small differences in antibiotic 
exposure and to assess safety.
Our trial had some limitations. We did not 
directly address whether antibiotics can be safe-
ly withheld on the basis of a low procalcitonin 
level alone but rather tested the effect of a deploy-
ment strategy to promote the recommended use 
of the assay in clinical practice (in a patient 
population in which the likelihood of antimicro-
bial use was intermediate). In our strategy, pro-
calcitonin assay results were provided to the clini-

All data were analyzed in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle, and multiple imputation with the use of chained equations was 
used for missing outcome data. Plus–minus values are means ±SD.
†  
To adjust for multiple comparisons, 99.86% confidence intervals are provided for the secondary antibiotic-exposure outcomes (i.e., re-
ceived any antibiotics by day 30, antibiotic prescription in the emergency department [ED], and antibiotic-days during hospital stay) in the 
intention-to-treat population and for all antibiotic-exposure outcomes for the four main final diagnoses (asthma, COPD, acute bronchitis, 
and community-acquired pneumonia). For outcomes expressed as percentages, the differences are given in percentage points.
‡  
The intention-to-treat population included all patients who underwent randomization and were eligible for the analysis.
§ 
 
The mean (±SD) number of antibiotic-days by day 30 among survivors at day 30 (1630 patients) was 4.3±5.7; the mean number of antibi-
otic-days by day 30 among nonsurvivors at day 30 (26 patients) was 4.4±4.3.
¶  
For the outcomes of received any antibiotics by day 30 and antibiotic prescription in ED, we first generated proportions from the inten-
tion-to-treat statistical model. We then multiplied these proportions by the sample size in each treatment group to estimate the counts, 
rounded to the nearest integer.
‖ 
 
Antibiotic prescription in the ED includes post-randomization receipt of antibiotics in ED and provision of an antibiotic prescription for 
patients at the time of discharge from the ED.
**  
The procalcitonin group in the per-protocol population included only the patients for whom the trial intervention was completed at all 
time points.
††  
The procalcitonin group in the per-guideline population included only the patients for whom the treating clinician adhered to procalcitonin 
guideline recommendations at all time points.
‡‡  
Two sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess robustness to missing data: a complete-case analysis, under an assumption that data 
were missing at random, and a missing-not-at-random analysis, in which all data were imputed from the usual-care group.

Day 1 is from the time of enrollment to midnight. Day 2 and beyond are from midnight to midnight. Serial procalci-
tonin levels were obtained from hospitalized patients through day 7. Data on post-discharge antibiotic exposure 
were derived from the intention-to-treat analysis of the primary outcome.
