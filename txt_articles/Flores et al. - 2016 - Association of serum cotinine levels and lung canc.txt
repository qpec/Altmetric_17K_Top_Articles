Abstract
This study was performed to quantify the association between mortality and known and unknown secondhand smoke 
(SHS) exposure as measured by cotinine levels in non-smokers. Data collected from 1999 to 2010 in the National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were linked to the National Death Index. Self-reported non-smokers aged 
≥20 years (N = 20 175) were studied. Serum cotinine was measured at recruitment; non-smokers were those with cotinine 
below the reported race-specific cut-off points (5.92, 4.85 and 0.84 
ng/ml for non-Hispanic blacks, non-Hispanic whites and 
Mexican Americans, and 3.08 
ng/ml for all other groups). Serum cotinine levels were significantly associated with overall 
survival (HRadj 1.17, 95% CI: 1.13–1.22 per natural-log unit change in cotinine), death for all medical causes, lung cancer, all 
cancers and heart diseases, after adjustment for gender, race/ethnicity, body mass index, smoking history and education. 
Similar results were observed when non-smokers reporting no SHS exposure at home or work were analyzed. There was a 
statistically significant trend in years of life lost (YLL), adjusted for confounders, across cotinine categories both in non-
smokers (YLLadj: 5.6, 6.4, 6.8, 7.5; P for trend < 0.0001) and non-smokers reporting no SHS exposure (YLL adj: 5.5, 6.1, 6.3, 6.7; 
P for trend = 0.002). Serum cotinine levels identify SHS-attributable mortality in subjects who would have otherwise been 
overlooked by questionnaire data, providing further evidence that the economic toll of SHS may be substantially higher 
than what was reported based on questionnaires.
Introduction
Secondhand smoke (SHS) was classified as a carcinogen by the 
International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2004, and the 
statement was supported by the Surgeon General in a report 
published shortly thereafter (1,2). The pooled evidence indicated 
a 20–30% increase in the risk of lung cancer from SHS exposure 
associated with living with a smoker. Despite these two cor-
nerstone documents, today the debate on the quantification of 
lung cancer risk according to the amount of SHS and in rela-
tion to other sources of environmental carcinogens is still open 
(3–5), and strong uniform policies to enforce the maintenance of 
tobacco-free air throughout the USA are lacking. Data included 
in the Surgeon General report show the associations between 
SHS and lung cancer to be weak and limited to the upper lev-
els of SHS exposure. This is likely attributable to the inaccuracy 
of questionnaire data: most of the information is derived from 
case–control studies (3), and some investigators have expressed 
concerns that exposure measurement error (or misclassifica-
tion) affects the estimates obtained through questionnaires. 
Accurate SHS exposure information measured through ques-
tionnaires are flawed by recall bias, amount and duration of 
exposure and by the difficulty in identifying ubiquitous sources 
of SHS exposure present in the environment. In fact, despite 
the fact that exposure to SHS is decreasing in the USA, as of 
2012 many states still allow smoking in some capacity in pub-
lic places (6). In a study conducted in 2003–2004, only 14.8% of 
adults reported home or work exposure, but 42.4% of the par-
ticipants had detectable serum cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine 
(7) that can be measured in urine, saliva and serum, and has

a half-life of 15–20 
h. The relationship between recent smoking 
habits, smoking dose and cotinine has been studied and quanti-
fied; roughly 1 unit of cotinine on a log scale corresponds to an 
exposure to three cigarettes (8,9). Many studies have shown that 
cotinine levels correlate well with self-reported active and pas-
sive smoking exposure (10,11).
There is a need to address and quantify the risk of cancer 
and cardiovascular diseases in non-smokers exposed to SHS. 
A refined dose–response approach is needed to implement 
stricter smoking ban regulations, identify subjects who are 
unknowingly at risk for cancer and cardiovascular disease, and 
to extend early detection programs to subjects exposed to SHS 
in an attempt to ultimately reduce cause-specific mortality.
To address these issues, serum cotinine was used as a biolog-
ical marker of exposure to SHS and linked with National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to overall and 
cause-specific mortality in non-smokers.
Methods
Study design and participants
NHANES is a population-based cross-sectional series of surveys 
designed to assess the health and nutritional status of non-
institutionalized children and adults in the USA. Each cross-
sectional survey is completed over a 2-year-period, which is 
defined as ‘cycle’ by NHANES. NHANES uses a complex, multi-
stage, probability sampling design to produce a nationally rep-
resentative sample of roughly 5000 non-institutionalized US 
children and adults for each cycle. NHANES data sets from 1999 
to 2010 are linked through periodic matching to the National 
Death Index (NDI) (12–14), a system that records mortality by 
means of death certificate information for all deaths in the 
United States since 1986. Matching between NHANES and NDI 
is performed by a combination of name, Social Security number 
and date of birth, with a success rate exceeding 95%. The most 
recently (April 2015) released mortality-linked data (1999–2010) 
included participants aged ≥20 years at the initial survey, with 
follow-up through 31 December 2011. Causes of death are cat-
egorized based on the International Classification of Diseases, 
Tenth Revision (ICD-10) into 10 categories: Disease of heart (I00-
I09, I11, I13, I20-I51), Malignant neoplasms (C00-C97), Chronic 
lower respiratory diseases (J40-J47), Accidents (unintentional 
injuries) (V01-X59, Y85-Y86), Cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs) 
(I60-I69), Alzheimer’s disease (G30), Diabetes mellitus (E10-E14), 
Influenza and pneumonia (J09-J18), Nephritis, nephrotic syn-
drome and nephrosis (N00-N07, N17-N19, N25-N27) and all other 
causes. The NHANES protocol was developed and reviewed in 
compliance with the policies for protection of human research 
subjects developed by the United States Department of Health 
and Human Services, and is reviewed and approved by the NCHS 
Research Ethics Review Board (ERC) annually (15).
For this study, data from 1999 to 2010 (which corresponds 
to six cycles of cross-sectional data collection: 1999–2000; 
2001–2002; 2003–2004; 2005–2006; 2007–2008; 2009–2010) were 
aggregated, and non-smokers with cotinine below ethnic/
race-specific cut-off points that are considered to discriminate 
(8) between smokers and non-smokers (5.92, 4.85 and 0.84 
ng/
ml for non-Hispanic blacks, non-Hispanic whites and Mexican 
Americans, 3.08 
ng/ml for all other groups), were included. Self-
reported never smokers (those who answered no to the question 
‘did you smoke at least 100 cigarettes in life?’) or ex-smokers 
who quit six or more months before the interview were included 
in the definition of non-smokers. Out of the initial 22 298 adult 
participants (aged ≥ 20 years) who had complete data on coti-
nine levels and had a valid linkage to the NDI, 2123 participants 
were excluded due to the following reasons: reported recent 
use of tobacco products other than cigarettes in the past 5 days 
(n = 1130), and participants with cotinine above the ethnic/race-
specific cut-off points (n = 993). The final study cohort consisted 
of 20 175 subjects (91% of the original sample).
Other data extracted included demographic: age, sex, race/
ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), alcohol and SHS information 
(defined by NHANES as self-reported living with smokers or 
smelling tobacco smoke at work).
NHANES cotinine laboratory analysis
Laboratory analyses of serum cotinine were performed by the 
Centers for Disease Control  (CDC) and Prevention as part of 
the NHANES protocol by an isotope dilution-high performance 
liquid chromatography/atmospheric pressure chemical ioniza-
tion tandem mass spectrometry (10,16). The detection limits 
(DLs) used by CDC were 0.05 ng/ml for 1999–2000, 0.05 ng/ml and 
0.015 ng/ml for 2001–2002, and 0.015 ng/ml for 2003–2010. Data 
points below DLs were replaced by DL/ Ö2.  Detailed sample 
collection and processing are reported by CDC elsewhere (15). 
Statistical analysis
Weighted summary statistics were produced to account for the 
complex sampling design of NHANES (17,18), using proc survey-
means and proc surveyfreq procedures for continuous and cat-
egorical variables, respectively. The descriptive characteristics 
of the population are presented stratified according to ≤ and 
> the DL (0.05 
ng/ml; 19). Cotinine was also categorized into 
four groups: ≤ DL (0.05 
ng/ml), DL < cotinine ≤ 33rd percentile, 
33rd percentile < cotinine ≤ 66th percentile and cotinine > 66th 
percentile, where 33rd and 66th percentiles were ethnic/race-
specific tertiles of those cotinine values that were above the DL. 
Such race-specific tertiles cut-offs were 0.083 and 0.17 
ng/ml 
for Mexican Americans, 0.093 and 0.26 
ng/ml for non-Hispanic 
Whites, 0.105 and 0.35 
ng/ml for non-Hispanic Blacks, and 0.086 
and 0.19 
ng/ml for other groups, respectively. 
Hazard ratios (HRs) for 1 unit increase in cotinine on the nat-
ural log scale were calculated using Cox proportional-hazards 
model (proc surveyphreg) with based-line age at the examination 
as the time-scale (20) and adjusted for sex, education (less than, 
equal to or higher than high school), smoking history (ex-smok-
ers and never smokers), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White or 
others) and BMI (<25, 25.0–29.9 or ≥30 
kg/m2). To test the robust-
ness of the association between cotinine levels and mortality, 
given that 63.8% of the population had cotinine levels below 
the DL, the same models were also run with the four cotinine 
categories [≤ DL (0.05 
ng/ml), DL < cotinine ≤ 33rd percentile, 
33rd percentile < cotinine ≤ 66th percentile and cotinine > 66th 
percentile)]. Causes of death were grouped into nine categories:

all causes, all medical causes, all cancers, heart diseases, CVDs, 
Alzheimer’s disease, chronic lower respiratory diseases, other 
medical conditions and lung cancer. For lung cancer, mortality 
data were available from 2001 to 2004 only. Further adjustment 
for alcohol consumption did not significantly affect the hazard 
ratio estimates, although the sample size was greatly reduced 
(n = 18 694), therefore alcohol was not kept in the multivariate 
analyses.
Years of life lost (YLL) for individual deaths (n = 2004) were 
obtained from the expected years of life based on the US Life 
Tables stratified by each 1-year age interval, sex and race (21). 
For the six survey cycles from 1999–2010, the Life Tables for the 
years 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010 (22) were used, respec-
tively. Subjects above 85 years are all coded in one category as 
85 years old in NHANES; average life expectancies between 85 
and 100+ years from the Life Tables were used for this group. 
Because no separated life expectancy tables for races other than 
white and black were available before 2008, the overall national 
data were used for other races. Associations between YLL (natu-
ral log transformed) and the four cotinine categories (≤DL and 
then ethnic/race specific tertiles) were analyzed using regres-
sion analysis (proc surveyreg), and adjusted for sex, education, 
smoking history, race/ethnicity and BMI.
The age at which 75% of the population was still alive was 
calculated based on Kaplan–Meier estimates (proc lifetest), strati-
fied by the four levels of cotinine (≤DL, and then ethnic/race-
specific tertiles).
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (ver-
sion 9.3, Cary, NC). Survival probability for one unit increase in 
cotinine on the natural log scale was estimated from Cox pro-
portional-hazards model with sampling weight applied (proc 
phreg) for all-cause mortality and visualized in RStudio (version 
0.99.441). The List-wise deletion method was used to handle 
missing data.
Results
Serum cotinine and mortality
The study population included 20 175 subjects (Table 1), 8747 
males and 11 428 females. Most of the subjects had com-
pleted high school or above, one-third had a BMI below 25 kg/
m2, roughly two-third self-identified as non-Hispanic whites. 
Forty-one percent of males and 23% of females had a history 
of smoking, although they had quit more than 6 months before 
the interview. Only 9% of males and 5% of females with cotinine 
below DL reported SHS exposure (i.e. living or working with a 
smoker). Subjects were actively linked to the NDI, and over the 
follow-up 2004 deaths were recorded, 1284 among those coti-
nine ≤ DL, 720 among those > DL.
Overall survival (Figure 1) was significantly associated with 
serum cotinine levels (HRadj 1.17, per natural-log unit change in 
cotinine; 95% CI: 1.13–1.22), after adjustment for sex, education, 
smoking history, race/ethnicity and BMI. If the four cotinine lev-
els (≤DL, and then race-specific tertiles) were used in the model 
instead of continuous cotinine, the adjusted hazard ratio (95% 
CIs) were: 1.24 (1.07–1.44); 1.32 (1.09–1.59) and 1.58 (1.30–1.91), 
respectively, versus cotinine ≤ the DL (P for trend < 0.0001; 
Supplementary Table 1, available at Carcinogenesis Online).
The natural-log unit change of serum cotinine was also 
statistically significantly associated with all medical causes of 
death, lung cancer, all cancers, heart diseases and other medical 
causes of death (Figure 2a), after adjustment for gender, race/
ethnicity, BMI, smoking history and education. The analysis 
was repeated using the four cotinine levels (≤DL, and then race-
specific tertiles), with similar results (Supplementary Table 1, 
available at Carcinogenesis Online). There was no significant 
association between cotinine and death from CVDs, Alzheimer’s 
disease and chronic lower respiratory diseases. Among the 
covariates used in the adjusted model (Supplementary Table 2, 
available at Carcinogenesis Online), gender (female versus male) 
was independently inversely associated with mortality for all 
causes, all medical causes, all cancers, heart diseases, CVDs 
and other medical causes, but not significantly associated with 
Alzheimer’s disease, chronic lower respiratory diseases and lung 
cancer. BMI was independently positively associated with mor-
tality for all causes, all medical causes, all cancers, heart dis-
eases and other medical causes. Non-whites had significantly 
higher risks of death than non-Hispanic whites for all causes, all 
medical causes, all cancers and other medical causes, but signif-
icantly lower risks of death for Alzheimer’s disease. Compared 
to never smokers, former smokers had higher risk of death over-
all and for lung cancer, all cancers, chronic lower respiratory dis-
eases, all medical causes and other medical causes.
Stratification of the analysis by gender (Supplementary 
Figure 1, available at Carcinogenesis Online) showed that the 
strength of the association was slightly stronger in males, with 
the exception of lung cancer. In the analysis of the subset of 
former smokers, with additional adjustment for years since 
quitting smoking and cigarettes smoked per day before quitting, 
serum cotinine was statistically significantly associated with all 
medical causes of death, death for heart diseases and all can-
cers (Supplementary Figure 2, available at Carcinogenesis Online).
In order to assess the unique role of cotinine as a predic-
tor of mortality, a subgroup analysis among non-smokers who 
did not report living/working with a smoker, with cotinine levels 
below the race-specific cutoffs was performed (N = 17 634). After 
adjustment for sex, education, BMI, Race/ethnicity and smoking 
history, the associations remained similar to what observed in 
the main analysis (Figure 2b; Supplementary Table 1, available at 
Carcinogenesis Online).
YLL and serum cotinine
Significant associations were observed between YLL and 
cotinine levels, both at univariate analysis, and after adjust-
ment for sex, education, race/ethnicity, BMI and smoking his-
tory (Figure 3a). There was a significant increase in YLL across 
cotinine categories (from 8.3 YLL among those with cotinine ≤ 
DL to 11.7 YLL among those with cotinine > the 66th percen-
tile; P for trend <0.0001), as well as in adjusted YLL across coti-
nine categories, from 5.6 YLL among those with cotinine ≤ DL 
to 7.5 YLL among those with cotinine > the 66th percentile (P 
for trend <0.0001). The association remained significant in the 
subgroup of non-smokers who did not report any SHS exposure 
 
(n of deaths = 1825; Figure 3b). Crude YLL were 8.2, 9.5, 9.7, 10.1, 
respectively, across cotinine categories (≤DL, >DL–≤33rd percen-
tile, 33rd percentile–≤66th percentile; P for trend <0.0008), while 
the corresponding adjusted values were 5.5, 6.1, 6.3, 6.7 YLL 
 
(P for trend <0.002).
Based on the survival function, the average age of the pop-
ulation when 75% of it was still alive was calculated accord-
ing to the cotinine categories (≤DL, >DL–≤33rd percentile, 33rd 
percentile–≤66th percentile): the average age (95% CIs) was 80, 
79 (95% CI: 78, 80), 78 (95% CI: 76, 79) and 77 (95% CI: 75, 78) years, 
respectively (Figure 1). Compared to participants with cotinine ≤ 
DL, those with higher cotinine levels lived 1–3 fewer years (log-
rank test P < 0.0001). Similar results (log-rank test P < 0.0001) 
were observed among non-smokers who reported not living or

working with a smoker [average age when 75% of the population

Discussion
This is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of an asso-
ciation between mortality and a biomarker of SHS exposure 
in a large cohort of nationally representative US non-smoker 
subjects. A single serum cotinine measurement predicted all-
cause mortality, lung cancer, all cancers, in addition to heart 
diseases and other medical causes. A number of non-smokers 
who reported not being exposed to SHS at home or work dem-
onstrated elevated levels of cotinine, suggesting unrecognized 
exposure to SHS; in these subjects, an elevated mortality for 
lung cancer and all cancers was observed. The presence of coti-
nine levels in non-smokers self-reporting no SHS exposure may 
have led to misclassification in prior studies investigating the 
association between SHS and disease/illness. The misclassifica-
tion would tend to attenuate the differences in clinical outcomes 
between self-reported exposed and non-exposed individuals, 
and could explain some of the controversy about the strength of 
the association between SHS and health effects.
Another finding of this analysis was that a casual measure-
ment of cotinine above the DL was associated with more YLL 
than what observed in this study, e.g. in former smokers. A dose–
response trend in YLL was observed when cotinine is divided in 
quartiles, suggesting a biological foundation to these findings. 
The number of YLL among people in the highest cotinine group 
was comparable to the years lost we observed, e.g. in subjects 
with a BMI >25 
kg/m2. The range of cotinine values included in 
this analysis was below the threshold level considered to dis-
criminate between smokers and non-smokers, and was purpo-
sively much lower than any value presented in other studies 
analyzing the role of cotinine in predicting cardiovascular mor-
tality (23–25), in order to examine potential associations with 
health effects of what is considered a minimal exposure to SHS.
A concerning finding of this analysis was observed in the 
subgroup of subjects who did not report any known SHS expo-
sure at home or work but had cotinine levels above the DL: these 
subjects demonstrated increased mortality for lung and other 
cancers as well as heart diseases. The HR of lung cancer death 
in this population ranged from 1.2 to 1.4, a figure that fits with 
the increase in lung cancer risk observed in questionnaire based 
studies on SHS (4). However, this category in our study included 
subjects who did not report any SHS exposure and therefore 
would not have been candidates for preventive measures aimed 
at decreasing their risk of death, as opposed to smokers or 
people aware of their SHS exposure. In other words, this study 
surprisingly demonstrated SHS-attributable mortality in sub-
jects who would have otherwise been determined to not be at 
increased risk of death.
The extent of the risk associated with SHS was likely under-
estimated in this study, for several reasons. This analysis could 
only assess the link between cotinine levels and mortality; while 
lung cancer mortality is a good proxy of lung cancer incidence, 
for other cancers as well as diseases such as cardiovascular and 
respiratory diseases whose mortality rates are much lower, the

lost’ (YLL) was natural log transformed.

observed associations could be much stronger if incidence and 
prevalence data were available. We have purposely restricted 
the cohort to non-smokers with cotinine levels below the race-
specific cut-off suggested in the literature for defining smok-
ers (8) in order to diminish the chances of including smokers; 
this decision may have removed participants with high levels 
of exposure to SHS, thus underestimating the true association 
with mortality.
The present analysis has several limitations: serum cotinine 
is a short term estimate of exposure and does not reflect life-
time exposure to SHS; cotinine measures have a certain degree 
of individual variability (1), and this could not be taken into 
account here, since only one measure was available for each 
subject. However, this variability should be equally distributed 
in the population and should be independent of mortality data. 
Cotinine may be derived from other sources, for example trace 
amounts of nicotine may be consumed with diet (1). However, 
it has been calculated that any contribution from this source is 
likely small compared with the amount absorbed from SHS expo-
sure (1). Another aspect to consider is that some self-reported 
non-smokers in this study may in fact be smokers. However, by 
purposefully setting the upper cotinine limit to a very low cut-
off level, we are confident that smokers were by far excluded. It 
has been demonstrated in the past that the proportion of self-
reported non-smokers misclassified based on cotinine meas-
urements is low (26). In a case–control study of SHS and lung 
cancer among reported lifetime non-smokers that determined 
urinary cotinine levels as a marker of recent exposure to tobacco 
smoke, 0.6% of cases and 2.3% of controls were considered to be 
misclassified as lifetime non-smokers because their urinary coti-
nine levels exceeded the designated limit for involuntary smok-
ing only (27). In this study, if any misclassification occurred, this 
should have been non-differential and randomly distributed, 
since subjects did not know what their chance of death was at 
the time of cotinine measurement and interview.
Despite the fact that the CDC recently reported that SHS 
exposure among non-smokers has declined from 1999 to 
2008, still 58 million US residents were exposed in 2011–12, 
including 15 million children aged 3–11 years (19); in addition, 
the same report highlighted that the exposure is unequally 
distributed in the population, with children, non-Hispanic 
blacks, persons living in poverty and persons who rent their 
housing being disproportionally affected. Previous studies 
have shown that cars, public housing and multiunit hous-
ing residents are at increased risk for SHS exposure, and that 
these locations are not regulated by any federal or state ant-
ismoking laws (28,29).
The results of this study indicate that questionnaires cap-
ture only a fraction of the SHS exposed population. The num-
ber of years lost in the population with detectable cotinine but 
unrecognized SHS exposure suggests that the economic toll 
of SHS may be substantially higher than what was reported 
based on questionnaire data alone (30). The study offers fur-
ther evidence that stricter legislation on smoke-free areas 
which include public housing, together with education efforts 
in low-income, minority communities on the deleterious 
effects of SHS at home, cars and other family gathering places 
are needed.
