Background-—Physical activity (PA) has an established favorable impact on cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes and quality of
life. In this study, we aimed to estimate the economic effect of moderate-vigorous PA on medical expenditures and utilization from
a nationally representative cohort with and without CVD.
Methods and Results-—The 2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data were analyzed. Our study population was limited to
noninstitutionalized US adults ≥18 years of age. Variables of interest included CVD (coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure,
dysrhythmias, or peripheral artery disease) and cardiovascular modifiable risk factors (CRFs; hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
hypercholesterolemia, smoking, and/or obesity). Two-part econometric models were utilized to study cost data; a generalized
linear model with gamma distribution and link log was used to assess expenditures per capita. The final study sample included
26 239 surveyed individuals. Overall, 47% engaged in moderate-vigorous PA ≥30 minutes, ≥5 days/week, translating to
111.5 million adults in the United States stratifying by CVD status; 32% reported moderate-vigorous PA among those with CVD
versus 49% without CVD. Generally, participants reporting moderate-vigorous PA incurred significantly lower health care
expenditures and resource utilization, displaying a step-wise lower total annual health care expenditure as moving from CVD to
non-CVD (and each CRF category).
Conclusions-—Moderate-vigorous PA ≥30 minutes, ≥5 days/week is associated with significantly lower health care spending and
resource utilization among individuals with and without established CVD. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2016;5: e003614 doi: 10.1161/

C
ardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be the leading
cause of mortality and disability world-wide.1 One of the
most important cardiovascular modifiable risk factors (CRFs)
is lack of physical activity (PA), including prominently the lack
of intentional moderate-vigorous PA. It has been documented
that 150 minutes per week of moderate-vigorous physical
activity is sufficient to observe a reduction in all-cause
mortality risks,2,3 aside from also aiding in morbidity,4 and
overall decrease in CVD risk.5 In spite of the benefits of PA,
and its widely reported positive impact on most CRFs,4,6 its

 prevalence is well below desired levels, despite numerous
interventions to increase PA.7–11 In addition, many previous
studies have sought to describe the economic impact of PA
on health status,12–22 but these either exclusively studied
older populations and/or evaluated health-related charges
(rather
than
expenditures).
In
addition,
no
nation-wide
economic impact of PA has been reported in recent years.
In this study, we aimed to describe the impact of moderate-
vigorous PA on health care expenditure and resource utilization
across the spectrum of CVD status and CRF profiles from a
sample generalizable to the entire US population, and hypoth-
esized that health care expenditures and utilization were lower
among individuals who engaged in moderate-vigorous PA.
Methods
Study Design and Sampling
This retrospective study used data from the Medical Expen-
diture Panel Survey (MEPS), 2012. The MEPS, led by the
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, is a set of large-
scale, national surveys about individuals and families and their
medical providers and employers. The Household Component
(HC) of the MEPS collects data about health services used,
their frequency and cost, charges, source of payment, income,
employment, as well as ample data on insurance used by and
available to US workers.23 The MEPS respondents are
enrolled for 2 years of data collection, with a new panel
beginning each year. The sampling frame for the MEPS-HC is
drawn from respondents to the National Health Interview
Survey, and the design of the MEPS-HC survey includes
sampling weights, stratification, and clustering. The MEPS
sampling weights incorporate adjustment for the complex
sample design and reflect survey nonresponse and population
totals from the Current Population Survey.23
Of all files in the HC of the survey, we used the full-year
consolidated data files and medical conditions files. The full-
year consolidated data files contain most demographics at a
person level, including information on resource utilization and
costs, whereas the medical conditions files include each
diagnosis a person has, which, after being transcribed verbatim
at each survey, are translated into International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) by
professional coders. These files were linked together in order to
determine accurate results for each individual. Because MEPS
is comprised of publicly available, de-identified data files, this
study was exempt of institutional review board approval.24
Participants
The initial sample consisted of 38 974 surveyed individuals.
We limited our study population to noninstitutionalized US
adults ≥18 years of age (excluding 11 154 individuals
<18 years of age). Individuals with body mass index (BMI)
<18.5 kg/m2 (532) were further excluded from the sample
given that they often represent a sicker patient population.
Because of the subject matter of this study, individuals who,
for the entire survey period, were either completely unable to
walk or unable to walk up 10 steps (130) or pregnant at any
point during the survey (919) were also excluded from all
analyses.
Study Variables
Physical activity
Individuals in the study sample were classified into PA based
on their answers to the question, “Do you currently spend
half hour or more in moderate to vigorous physical activity,
at least five times a week?” The 2010 MEPS glossary (valid
for all subsequent surveys) states, “moderate physical
activity causes only light sweating or a slight or moderate
increase in breathing or heart rate and would include
activities such as fast walking, raking leaves, mowing the
lawn, or heavy cleaning. Vigorous physical activity causes
heavy sweating or large increases in breathing or heart rate
and would include activities such as running, race walking,
lap swimming, aerobic classes, or fast bicycling.”25 Partic-
ipants who answered “yes” to this question were categorized
as
“optimal
PA,”
and
“nonoptimal
PA”
otherwise.
An
important point to be made is that most respondents who
engaged in this level of PA closely resemble what most
researchers
refer
to
as
“exercise.”
Consequently,
our
categorization of nonoptimal PA individuals does not neces-
sarily mean “sedentary,” but that the 2008 Physical Activity
Guidelines Advisory Committee Report recommendations for
PA were not met.4
Cardiovascular disease and average cardiovascular
modifiable risk factor profile
Individuals in the study sample that had a diagnosis of
coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, dysrhythmias,
and/or peripheral artery disease (ascertained by ICD-9-CM
codes: 410, 413, 414, 433–437, 427, 428, 440, 443, and
447, respectively) were classified as having diagnosed CVD.
CRFs were ascertained using self-reported questionnaires in
the MEPS-HC survey, where individuals with presence of 1 or
more
of:
hypertension,
diabetes
mellitus,
hypercholes-
terolemia, smoking, and/or obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2, a
constructed variable using self-reported weight and height)
were included. Based on the presence of these individual risk
factors, survey participants were profiled as “poor” (≥3
cardiovascular risk factors), “average” (2 cardiovascular risk
factors), or “optimal” (0–1 cardiovascular risk factors).

 Expenditures and resource utilization
Total annual direct medical expenditures were calculated for
each person. Data for the calculation of this variable included
expenditures from all payer groups and out-of-pocket spend-
ing, including information from hospitalizations, prescribed
medications, outpatient visits (hospital outpatient visits and
office-based visits), emergency department (ED) visits, and
other expenditures (dental visits, vision aid, home health care,
and other medical supplies). In a similar fashion, resource
utilization analysis assessed the total number of outpatient
and ED visits, number of hospitalizations, and number of
prescription medications’ purchases/refills each surveyed
individual incurred.
Covariates
Other variables included in the study were age, sex, health
status, family income, race/ethnicity, employment, metropoli-
tan statistical area, insurance type, education, geographical
region, and modified Charlson Comorbidity Index (without
cardiovascular components). Categorical variables were clas-
sified as follows: 5 categories were used for age (18–39, 40–
54, 55–64, 65–74, and ≥75); 3 categories for family income
(poor/near poor [<125% of the 2012 federal poverty level],
low/middle income [125% to <400% federal poverty level],
and high income [≥400% federal poverty level]); 5 categories
for race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
non-Hispanic Asian, non-Hispanic other, and Hispanic); 3
categories for insurance type (private, public only, and
uninsured); 5 categories for education (less than high school,
high school diploma, some college, college [bachelor’s
degree] and masters, doctorate, or professional); 4 categories
for geographical region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and
West); and 3 categories for modified Charlson Comorbidity
Index (0, 1, and ≥2).
Statistical Analysis
For
comparison
of
demographic
characteristics
in
our
sample, chi-square tests were performed.26 Because of the
right-skewedness of expenditures data (ie, most expenditures
are seen in only a small proportion of the population), two-
part models were utilized to study expenditures.27 Two-part
models are often used to model health care expenditures,
and are the product of: (1) the probability that any given
individual had any expenditures and (2) their mean expen-
ditures.28 The first part of the model consists on a
probabilistic regression model (probit), which estimates the
probability of zero versus positive expenditures. Contingent
upon having a positive annual health care expenditure, a
generalized linear model (glm) with gamma distribution and a
logarithmic-link function estimates the average expenditure
per capita28,29; we determined the distribution of the glm
using the modified Park Test.30 For resource utilization,
unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were
utilized. Unadjusted means and proportions were calculated,
adjusting for the survey design and sampling weight. For
multivariate analyses, variable selection for inclusion into the
model was determined using a combination of the Akaike
information criterion and their relevance toward cost anal-
ysis. Collinearity was assessed using the variance inflated
factor. For all statistical analyses, P<0.05 was considered
statistically significant. All analyses were carried out using
Stata software (version 13.1; StataCorp LP, College Station,
TX). Total and marginal expenditures were estimated using
the “margins” command after the two-part models.28 All
analyses took into consideration the MEPS complex survey
design.
Results
Population Characteristics
The final study population consisted of 26 239 participants
≥18 years of age (47.6�17 years; 51.5% female), which
translates to �223.7 million US adults; demographic infor-
mation is presented in Table 1. Overall, 1896 (9%) had a
CVD diagnosis, representing 19.4 million of the noninstitu-
tionalized adult population in the United States. Forty-nine
percent of those without CVD and 32% of those with CVD
reported engaging in moderate-vigorous PA. Irrespective of
CVD status, participants with optimal PA were less likely to
have underlying CVD risk factors, as well as reporting
better health status, higher socioeconomic and education
strata,
and
lower
prevalence
of
comorbid
conditions
(Table 1).
Healthcare Expenditures
Univariate and multivariate models estimating average per
capita health care expenditures are presented in Table 2.
Presence of CVD was independently associated with higher
health care expenditures when compared to individuals
without CVD. Despite this, presence of optimal PA was
associated with lower health care expenditures across CVD
status and CRF spectrum. Among those without CVD, those
with optimal CRF and PA had a mean annual expenditure of
$2328 (95% CI, 1932, 2726), compared to $5475 (95% CI,
4668, 6283) of those with poor CRF and PA (Table 2, model
1). After adjusting for other covariates (demographics,
socioeconomic status, insurance type, and comorbidities),
these marked differences remained (Table 2, model 3).
Moreover, when comparing the marginal expenditures of
optimal PA versus nonoptimal PA, the impact of PA on health

 care expenditures was highest for those with established
CVD, followed by participants without CVD but underlying
poor CRF profile (Table 2).
Weighted and adjusted estimates by specific expenditure
category (health care utilization expenditures: hospitaliza-
tions, prescription medications, ED visits, outpatient visits,
and other) according to CRF profile and CVD status are
presented in Figure 1. Among those with CVD, the highest
expenditures pertained to hospitalizations (with expenditures
of $5644 and $4233 for nonoptimal PA and optimal PA,
respectively), followed by prescription medications and out-
patient visits. Among those without CVD, the major part of
costs among non-CVD individuals was attributed to outpatient
visits, with those with poor CRF spending an annual average
of $2019 and $1918 (nonoptimal PA and optimal PA,
respectively), compared to $1319 and $1215 of those with
optimal CRF. The highest differences were noted in prescrip-
tion medications, with those with a poor CRF profile and
nonoptimal PA spending $400 more than their optimal PA
counterparts. The lowest expenditures were noted among
those without CVD, with optimal CRF profile and optimal PA,
with an average of $810 on hospitalizations, $587 on
prescription medications, and $1215 on outpatient visits
(Figure 1).

 Healthcare Resource Utilization
Table 3 summarizes health care utilization rates across PA,
CRF, and CVD categories. Overall, optimal PA was associated
with significantly less use of health care resources. Among
surveyed participants with CVD, those with optimal versus
nonoptimal PA were less likely to have an ED visit (24% vs
31%) or any hospitalization (21% vs 27%). The lowest rate of
ED visits (9.1%) and hospitalizations (2.6%) was noted among
those reporting optimal PA without a CVD diagnosis and
presence of optimal CRF profile. After adjusting for key
covariates, among individuals without CVD, those with optimal

utilizers” (at or above the 75th percentile for usage at each
particular healthcare resource; Figure 2A and 2B).
Discussion
Past reports have described the relationship between some
level of PA and costs13,17,19,20,22,31; however, none have
recently shown this on the basis of CVD,16 with a focus on
CRFs. This study provides current estimates from a nationally
representative sample of the US population. We found lower
health care expenditures and resource utilization associated
with moderate-vigorous PA, regardless of CVD status. Addi-
tionally, we found significantly lower health care expenditures
of PA individuals by each individual CRF profile.
Our results are consistent with most past reports and are
an important addition to the understanding of health care
expenditures relating to PA. First, this study adds to current
literature by providing current national estimates of health
care savings among those who engage in moderate-vigorous
PA. Second, this project not only ascertains the differences
between CVD and non-CVD populations, but also brings a
special focus on non-CVD individuals and their CRF profile to
demonstrate that efforts concerning prevention are still much
needed. Third, to the authors’ knowledge, this is the first
attempt to describe both costs and their relating resource
utilization estimates regarding PA in a single study.
It has become widely accepted that PA leads to better
health outcomes and enhances the prevention of diseases like
CVD, diabetes mellitus, cancer, hypertension, obesity, depres-
sion, and osteoporosis.32 Consequently, many studies have

 assessed PA’s economic impact. Some have reported no
differences in savings related to PA; Chevan et al. found no
short-term savings related to PA,13 whereas Martinson et al.
found no differences for those in their forties, but significant
lower short-term charges in those physically active aged 50
and above, compared to those inactive.15 Others have found
the opposite to be true. Wang et al. reported savings of more
than 50% when comparing CVD versus non-CVD individuals
from a nationally representative sample.16 From our results,
we estimate that PA results in a 20% reduction in health care
expenditure among those with CVD and in a 50% reduction
when comparing those with CVD versus non-CVD and having
poor CRF (the most affected individuals in the non-CVD
categorization; Table 2, model 3). Similarly, Pronk et al.
studied modifiable health risks and short-term health care–
related charges, and found that those that engaged in PA had
a 4.7% reduction in median charges when compared to those
not engaged in PA. Additionally, they reported that in a
general population of ≥60 years of age, without diabetes
mellitus, or congenital heart disease, high-risk individuals (BMI
≥25 kg/m2, current smokers, and no PA) had a consistent
49% increase in mean annual charges compared to low-risk
individuals.14
Likewise,
even
with
a
slightly
different
classification of risk factors, our results show health care
savings of more than 50% when comparing poor versus
optimal CRF, regardless of PA (Table 2, model 3). Further-
more, our results show relative savings of 16.7% and 13%
when comparing optimal PA versus nonoptimal PA among
those with poor and optimal CRF, respectively. More recently,
Carlson et al. reported that inactive adults spent $920 more
than their active equivalents.12 Although Carlson et al. did not
focus on CVD, our results seem to be in line with their
findings, with �$723 as the difference between optimal PA
versus nonoptimal PA in the multivariate model, in the general
population. Another recent study analyzed costs related to PA
using the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study (CCLS).17 They
found that expenditures in later life (≥65 years of age) were
greatly diminished if cardiorespiratory fitness was achieved in
midlife years (around 50 years of age). Our results are not
readily comparable with theirs given that they only studied
Medicare- and Medicaid-covered individuals. Moreover, indi-
viduals from the CCLS tend to be healthier than the general
US population.33 Notwithstanding, their conclusions and ours
support the same concept: PA needs to be promoted and/or
improved, with data to bolster third-party payers into action
for a less-devastating economic future for the nation,

 especially given that chronic disease prevalence is on the
rise.34,35 From the health care resource utilization point of
view, a Canadian study reported an inverse association with
PA and utilization among individuals 65 years and older.36 Our
results too show a tendency of diminishing resource utiliza-
tion when comparing optimal PA versus nonoptimal PA,
especially when comparing CVD and non-CVD individuals.
Overwhelming
evidence
points
toward
a
world-wide
increase in prevalence of noncommunicable chronic diseases.
Dall et al. estimated that by the year 2025, most growth in
outpatient visits will be reflected primarily in the field of
cardiology, which, along with vascular surgery, will have the
highest projected growth in demand.37 Consequently, several
initiatives have been set up with a goal to help mitigate the
increase in noncommunicable diseases, such as the American
Heart Association’s (AHA) 2020 Strategic Goals,34 Health
2020,38 or the “25925” Strategy.39 Unsurprisingly, PA is an
integral part of all these efforts, and yet the current
prevalence of PA engagement remains below 50% for non-
CVD and below 35% for CVD individuals, according to our
results, including the advent of recent reports favoring
interventions among middle-aged individuals,40 or even iden-
tifying the benefits of simpler strategies, such as walking, in
the prevention of CVD.41
Several limitations of this study should be noted. First,
because of the limited assessment of PA degree in the MEPS
questionnaires, we were only able to dichotomize PA levels as
those engaging versus not in self-reported moderate-vigorous

 activity, ≥30 minutes, ≥5 days/week (optimal vs nonoptimal).
This limitation precludes the opportunity to robustly describe
the interplay of reported PA levels across a wider spectrum
with CVD status as well as burden of modifiable CRF on the
overall health care expenditures. Given that the nonoptimal
PA category likely included individuals with minimal PA, it
likely resulted in more-conservative estimated differences of
medical expenditures between the 2 groups. Furthermore,
because of the nature of self-reported PA, there is a risk for
misclassification, though likely random. As a result, this can
attenuate the observed findings toward the null. It is
important to note that self-reported PA has been shown to
have moderate validity in other national surveys.42 Second, as
with any observational study, residual confounding is a
possibility. Even though efforts were made to prevent this
by controlling for most important variables, there is potential
for unmeasured characteristics, which could affect our study
outcomes. Third, the prevalence of CVD in this study is lower
than past national estimates (9% vs 36%).1 This is because the
diagnosis of CVD in our study did not consider hypertension
and instead was included in the spectrum of CRF profile
assessment. Fourth, because CVD and modifiable CRF were
self-reported, underestimation of the true national prevalence
is likely, as has been previously described, especially with
chronic conditions.43 As a result, the estimates in our study
are likely to be conservative. Because of lack of information
on dietary habits, we were not able to account for this
important modifiable risk factor. In addition, because of
reliance on self-reported risk factors and lack of information
on clinical values (eg, blood pressure), we were unable to
estimate the prevalence of the AHA defined “ideal CV health
status” in our study. Fifth, other analyses have found that
MEPS data tend to underestimate total medical expendi-
tures.44–46 This limitation would lead to a likely underestima-
tion of the actual cost associated with increasing burden of
modifiable CRF as well estimating savings from primordial
prevention strategies.
In conclusion, from a national representative population,
we provide strong evidence of the association between
moderate-vigorous PA and significantly lower health care
expenditures and resource utilization, irrespective of CVD
status and/or CRF burden. These robust estimates for
potential health care savings strongly support the AHA’s
strategic goals for optimizing PA levels as a mean to
favorably impact the increasing burden of CVD and associ-
ated costs.
