Reducing levels of the aggregation-prone Ab peptide that accumulates in the brain with
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been a major target of experimental therapies. An alternative
approach may be to stabilize the physiological conformation of Ab. To date, the physiological
state of Ab in brain remains unclear, since the available methods used to process brain tissue
for determination of Ab aggregate conformation can in themselves alter the structure and/or
composition of the aggregates. Here, using synchrotron-based Fourier transform infrared
micro-spectroscopy, non-denaturing gel electrophoresis and conformational specific anti-
bodies we show that the physiological conformations of Ab and amyloid precursor protein
(APP) in brain of transgenic mouse models of AD are altered before formation of amyloid
plaques. Furthermore, focal Ab aggregates in brain that precede amyloid plaque formation
localize to synaptic terminals. These changes in the states of Ab and APP that occur prior to
plaque formation may provide novel targets for AD therapy.

tudies on the aggregation state of b-amyloid peptide (Ab) in
brain typically have relied on brain tissue being processed
by
techniques
including
homogenization,
high-speed
centrifugation and/or enrichment, all of which may themselves
trigger alterations in protein structure and state of assembly of
aggregation-prone proteins. Moreover, assaying whole-brain
homogenate can make it difficult to detect localized pathology,
which may occur in the early stages of the disease, before
gradually progressing through the brain over time. A central
question in AD concerns the mechanism by which Ab structure
contributes to neuropathology1. The up to 42/43 amino acid long
Ab peptides, cleaved from within the larger amyloid precursor
protein (APP), are generally thought to normally exist in brain as
monomers that then with age abnormally aggregate to insoluble
fibrils in AD brain. Increasingly, soluble oligomers have been
viewed as the neurotoxic form of Ab. Various structures of Ab
oligomers are seen as important in AD, including particularly
dimers, trimers, dodecamers and larger amyloid beta-derived
diffusible ligands. However, studies on Ab in brain tissue have
generally relied on standard SDS gel electrophoresis or other
methods, which can alter native protein conformations. Thus, at
present, no consensus exists regarding the structures of Ab
species in brain associated with disease pathogenesis.
Here, to analyse the early changes in Ab structure in brains of
AD transgenic mouse models of b-amyloidosis, we used the non-
destructive techniques of synchrotron-based two-dimensional
Fourier transform infrared micro-spectroscopy imaging (mFTIR)
and blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE)
complemented with 3D confocal immunofluorescence microscopy.
BN-PAGE is a separation method that is sensitive to alterations
in the conformation of a protein and is therefore useful for the
study of protein aggregation. Combined with western blot it
provides higher sensitivity to detect Ab than gel filtration or
sucrose density ultra-centrifugation. mFTIR detects vibrations of
main-chain carbonyl groups that occur in the wavenumber range
of 1,600 to 1,700 cm � 1 (Amide I region)2, allowing for the
detection of specifically b-sheet structures3. Importantly, no tissue
processing is required, and non-volatile tissue components that
could be affected or lost during chemical processing remain
in situ and contribute to the infrared spectrum2–4. mFTIR permits
for the acquisition of spectra from samples as low as 100 pg
(ref. 5); however, mFTIR is a non-destructive technique, since
mid-IR photons are too low in energy (0.05–0.5 eV) to either
break chemical bonds or to cause ionization6,7. Using FTIR it was
shown that amyloid fibrils and native b-sheet proteins produce
different Amide I bands8, as they differ by the structural
variability of the residues constructing their sheets, the average
number of strands per sheet, and twist angles. Different
morphologies of purified amyloid fibrils and native b-sheet
proteins were confirmed in vitro by cryo-electron microscopy9.
Although in vitro and in vivo environments are of course different
and ideal controls for the FTIR experiments of brain tissue are
challenging, mFTIR has been used to specifically detect amyloid
fibrils in tissue sections10,11. Here we provide evidence of
localized b-sheet elevations in brain tissue of AD transgenic
mice using mFTIR that precede amyloid plaque formation. In
addition, using BN-PAGE we show the loss of a low molecular
weight Ab complex and emergence of higher weight Ab and
APP complexes in AD transgenic mouse brains that occur
concomitant with this pre-plaque rise in b-sheet content by
mFTIR.
Results
Pre-plaque b-sheet transition in transgenic AD models. To
focus on the development of amyloid pathology, we used young
AD transgenic Tg19959 mice harbouring two familial AD
mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which show
initial amyloid plaques at or just before 3 months of age12. mFTIR
spectral maps were recorded in chemically unprocessed brain
sections of Tg19959 and wild-type mice at 1, 2 and 3 months of
age (Fig. 1). We verified that the sample preparation used for our
mFTIR imaging of cryo-dried brain tissue did not introduce
artificial b-sheet formation, since change of b-sheet did not occur
with cryo-drying of synthetic Ab42 preparations (Supplementary
Fig. 1). The increase in intensity of a band around 1,627 cm � 1 in
the amide I region of the infrared spectra (red on the mFTIR
maps; Fig. 1a) correlated with the age of Tg19959 mice and is
indicative of increased b-sheet structures already developing
between 1 and 2 months, which is before amyloid plaque
formation as determined by thioflavin S (ThS) staining. To better
resolve the peak positions for b-sheet structures at around
1,627 cm � 1 and the band centred at 1,656 cm � 1 (a frequency
characteristic of a-helical structures), we performed a second
derivative analysis10,13. The second derivative spectra of wild type
and 1 month-old Tg animals displayed a peak at around
1,640 cm � 1, which together with the less intense bands above
1,675 cm � 1, can be assigned to the intra-molecular b-sheet
structures of native proteins10,11. The second derivative spectra of
AD transgenic animals are characterized by a peak at about
1,627 cm � 1, due to inter-molecular b-sheet structures. The inter-
molecular b-sheet content increased only in AD transgenic and
not in wild-type mouse brains at these ages (Fig. 1b–g). This type
of intermolecular b-sheet structure has been described as amyloid
aggregates in brain tissue samples analysed by mFTIR (refs 11,14).
However, b-sheet content in brain sections of 1-month-old
Tg19959
mice
was
similar
to
those
of
wild-type
mice.
Immunolabelling of post-fixed brain sections adjacent to the
FTIR brain sections with a C-terminal specific Ab42 antibody
indicated age-related increases of Ab42 in transgenic but not
wild-type mouse brain tissue. Of note, Ab42 labelling in 2 month-
old Tg19959 mice was punctate, and therefore not consistent with
pre-fibrillar diffuse plaques, whereas b-sheet structures detected
by mFTIR appear over significantly wider areas of cortex
(Supplementary Fig. 2a), which likely is to some extent due to
the lower spatial resolution of mFTIR. To complement the mFTIR
data, we used the conformation-specific antibody OC (ref. 15)
and ThS, which are both considered indicators of fibrillar amyloid
structures. However, the adjacent Tg19959 brain sections to those
showing early b-sheet structures by FTIR did not show evidence
of amyloid fibrils with antibody OC or ThS (Supplementary
Figs 3 and 4). The absence of ThS and OC antibody labelling may
be due to the low concentration of fibrils and/or dye specificity,
that ThS and OC labelling do not detect all types of fibrils16,17,
or due to a non-fibrillar nature of the b-sheet structures.

that
unstructured monomers were not present in the samples.
Instead, Ab40 oligomers show a peak at about 1,630 cm � 1,
which indicates the presence of b-sheets18. However, the electron
microscopy, small angle X-ray scattering and ThT spectroscopy
data support the non-fibrillar nature of these Ab40 oligomers:
lack of thin (12–15 nm), elongated (100–1,000 nm) and branched
structures, which are characteristics of fibrils19 (Fig. 2b–d). These
data corroborate previously published experimental data18 and
although the secondary structure of in vitro-generated Ab
oligomers cannot be a true prototype for oligomers that may
form in vivo in the complex environment of the brain, these data
support the hypothesis that the b-structures detected in brain

 tissue of Tg19959 mice at 2 months of age may originate from
non-fibrillar (non-ThT and non-OC positive) b-sheet Ab species
formed in brain tissue prior to amyloid plaques.
To model the above findings in brain in a cellular system, we
examined Ab aggregation in AD transgenic neurons in culture,
which show Ab accumulation with time, similar to what occurs in
brain with ageing20. mFTIR showed elevation of b-sheet structures
in AD transgenic neurons between 12 and 19 days in vitro,
compared to wild type neurons, respectively (Fig. 3a–c). Although
age of neurons in culture21 is not directly comparable to age of
neurons in brain, these results support the conclusion that
b-sheet structures can be formed within neurons.
Early changes in Ab/APP complexes in AD transgenic mice. To
analyse changes in the native conformation of Ab and APP in
brain tissue BN-PAGE and subsequent western blot using dif-
ferent Ab and/or APP specific antibodies was performed. For
molecular weight estimation of native Ab on BN-PAGE we used
synthetic Ab1-42, which runs as a mixture of monomers, dimers,
trimers and tetramers. Interestingly, Ab in brain of wild-type and

 1-month-old AD transgenic mice runs as a band closest to the
20 kDa low molecular weight marker on BN-PAGE (Fig. 4a,b;
Supplementary Fig. 5a), as well as a higher molecular weight
smear, which we show below, is however consistent with APP.
This Ab band corresponds to synthetic Ab1-42 tetramers running
on the same BN-PAGE (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 5).
Remarkably, at and after 2 months of age there was a drop in the
intensity of this Ab band in AD transgenic mouse brains on
BN-PAGE concomitant with an increase in Ab aggregation
evident as a high molecular weight smear between 100–500 kDa.
Blotting with antibody 369 against the C-terminus of APP/CTFs
and 22C11 against the N-terminus of APP suggests that this
Ab tetramer band that drops at 2 months in AD transgenic
mouse brain does not correspond to other APP fragments
(Supplementary Fig. 5b). Overall, these results support the con-
clusion that under physiological conditions Ab in brain initially
exists as a low molecular weight protein complex consistent
with Ab tetramers. With the age-related increase in Ab in AD

 transgenic mice, this Ab complex is then reduced as Ab forms
higher molecular weight aggregates. Strikingly, this change in the
initial state of Ab occurs concomitantly with the increase of
b-structured content detected by mFTIR.
We next analysed the molecular weight of APP in brains by
BN-PAGE (Fig. 4c; Supplementary Fig. 5c). Remarkably, the
molecular weight patterns of APP also changed between 1 and
2 months in brains of Tg19959 mice before the appearance
of amyloid plaques. Specifically, on BN-PAGE, APP in the
membrane soluble fraction of Tg19959 mouse brains at 1 month
of age runs similarly to APP in wild-type mouse brains as two
bands, which appear to correspond to APP monomers and
dimers22. In contrast, at 2 months of age, APP in Tg19959 mouse
brains changes to three bands with molecular weights that
correspond to about 140, 240 and 480 kDa. The appearance of the
additional 480 kDa band supports that APP may aggregate as
well. Interestingly, after 2 months of age, Tg19959 mouse
brains show a smear with a molecular weight corresponding to
240–480 kDa on BN-PAGE using Ab N-terminus antibody 82E1,
which could suggest an interaction between Ab and APP (ref. 23).

To investigate whether there is an age-dependent interaction
between Ab and APP, Tg19959 mouse brains were immuno-
precipitated with the human-specific APP antibody P2-1 followed
by dot blotting with the Ab42 specific antibody 12F4, which
indicated an age-dependent increase in the association of Ab42
with APP (data not shown). To experimentally examine the
interaction of Ab42 with APP, transgenic and wild-type mouse
neurons were treated with 1 mM synthetic human Ab1-42 for
24 h. After treatment, BN-PAGE followed by Western blot with
human Ab/CTF antibody 82E1 and Ab/APP antibody 6E10

labelling of neurons treated with 1 mM synthetic Ab1-42 showed a
greater binding of Ab1-42 to the cell surface of AD transgenic
than to wild-type neurons (Supplementary Fig. 6b). Taken
together these data support an interaction between Ab and
APP, and indicate that AD related protein aggregation is a
complex process during which the physiological states of both Ab
and APP are affected.
Ab aggregation and synapse pathology. To further define the
localization of these pre-plaque b-aggregates and to evaluate
potential pathological consequences of early Ab-aggregation in
brain, 1, 2 and 3 month-old Tg19959 mouse brain sections were
labelled with antibodies directed against Ab42 and synaptophysin
or drebrin, markers of pre- and post-synaptic compartments,
respectively. Three-dimensional confocal microscopy revealed
that AD transgenic mouse brains show progressive Ab42
accumulation in synaptic compartments (Fig. 5a; Supplementary
Figs 7 and 8). In particular, post-synaptic Ab42 labelling
increased in AD transgenic mouse brains. In 1-month-old
Tg19959 and wild-type mouse brains synaptic Ab42 labelling is
much less evident compared to older Tg19959 mice, consistent
with prior immuno-electron microscopy of another AD trans-
genic mouse model25. The increase of Ab42 labelling at two
months of age is concomitant with the FTIR and biochemical
data showing increases in Ab aggregation with age in these AD

 transgenic mice. Interestingly, with the increasing synaptic Ab in
Tg19959 mouse brains at two months of age, the overlap of Ab42
with the presynaptic protein synaptophysin also became more
evident. Moreover, at 3 months of age, when amyloid fibrils
detected by antibody OC are even more evident in synapses of
AD transgenic mouse brains, the pre- and post-synaptic proteins
appear to overlap more; such an increased overlap of the pre- and
post-synaptic markers suggests localized synaptic abnormalities
(Supplementary Fig. 7). The presence of Ab in synapses of
wild-type mouse brains, and its early accumulation in synapses in
transgenic mice, supports the conclusion that synapses are the
sites where physiological Ab starts to accumulate and aggregate,
thereby mediating synapse dysfunction in pre-plaque AD brain.
Taken together our results demonstrate alterations in the native
states of Ab and APP with pre-plaque b-aggregation, which is
concomitant with synaptic alterations in a transgenic mouse
model of b-amyloidosis.
Discussion
Here we provide evidence that the physiological conformation of
Ab in brain on BN-PAGE is consistent with synthetic Ab1-42
tetramers. Of note, tetramers were also the preferred state of
freshly prepared Ab1-42 run on the native gels (Fig. 4a;
Supplementary Fig. 5a). Native gels are less accurate when it
comes to molecular weight, and running the same synthetic
Ab1-42 preparations on semi-denaturing and SDS–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) gels showed progressive loss of
the tetramer band, and indicated that this tetramer band runs
closer to a 14 kD molecular weight marker (not shown). We also
noticed that the Ab42 specific antibodies detected the band
consistent with Ab42 tetramers in brain but not the synthetic
Ab1-42 tetramers (Fig. 4b). We previously reported that Ab42
specific antibodies react predominantly to Ab1-42 monomers20.
However, the observations in Fig. 4b suggest that the structure of
the Ab band that appears consistent with a tetramer in brain
differs from synthetic Ab1-42 tetramers. It is possible that,
for example, associated lipid components and/or N- and/or
C-terminally modified Ab peptides contribute to this difference
between this low molecular weight Ab complex in brain
compared to synthetic Ab42.
Importantly, we demonstrate that the loss of this physiological
state of Ab in AD transgenic mouse brain before plaque
formation is concomitant with the appearance of increased
b-sheet content by FTIR; however this is not ThS or OC antibody
positive, pointing to a non-fibrillar character of early b-sheet
formation. Although, the differences between transgenic and wild
type animals in the mFTIR spectra related to b-structures and

Figure 4 | Native Ab and APP complexes in Tg19959 mouse brains change with age. (a) Blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) and
subsequent Western blot of membrane-associated TBST fractions of mouse brain homogenates at 1 and 2 months of age. As detected by the human
specific 82E1 antibody, human Ab (dotted red box) in the Tg19959 mouse brain appears consistent with Ab1-42 tetramers as well as a smear at higher
molecular weights. Synthetic human Ab1–42 was used as a molecular weight marker and positive control (dotted black box; underexposed). (b) BN-PAGE
of membrane-associated fractions of mouse brain homogenates at 1 and 2 months of age and subsequent Western blotting with Ab42 specific antibodies
12F4 and MBC42 detect the presence of low molecular weight Ab42 bands (dotted red boxes). The low molecular weight Ab42 band appears specific,
since no band is observed in brain tissue homogenate from APP knockout mice. Statistical analysis of Ab42 in brain homogenate: ANOVA (Po0.01)
followed by Bonferroni’s post-hoc comparisons test (Po0.01); grey lines indicate the mean±s.d.; N of 4 represents number of independent experiments.
(c) Native APP in Tg19959 mouse brains changes with age. BN-PAGE and subsequent blotting with antibody 369 against the C-terminus of APP/CTFs and
22C11 against the N-terminus of APP show alterations in the molecular weight of APP with a 480 kDa band appearing at 2 months of age in Tg19959 mice
(dotted white boxes), which is not seen in WTor 1 month old Tg19959 mice. Total protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay and further
controlled by a parallel SDS PAGE blotted with b-actin; protein loaded was 100 mg per well in all experiments. Blots are representative, N ¼ 3.

 age-related increases in Ab42 are evident, development of new
antibodies which are both specific to b-structures and to Ab will
be helpful to determine whether the b-sheet structures detected
by mFTIR in brain tissue of transgenic animals originate from
Ab42. Further, we present evidence consistent with aggregation
of APP concomitant with Ab pathogenesis, which may be
contributing to the pre-plaque increase in b-structure. Since the
increase of Ab is concomitant with an apparent change in APP
structure, and since in vitro experiments support that Ab may
bind APP, it is possible that binding of Ab may cause changes in
APP structure that interfere with physiological processing of APP.
Dystrophic neurites, associated with amyloid plaques, are known
to accumulate APP, as well as Ab42 and the b-site amyloid
precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1, supporting the concept that
such dystrophies are the nidus of amyloid plaque formation20,25.
It is of considerable interest that the destabilization and loss of
the native state of normally tetrameric transthyretin has been
found to promote subsequent aggregation of transthyretin
into the b-sheet rich pathologic amyloid found in patients
with
transthyretin
amyloidosis.
Moreover,
pharmacological
stabilization of the physiological transthyretin tetramers led to
the approval of the first drug that slows down the progression of
an amyloidosis in the clinic26–28. Growing evidence also suggests
that the native oligomeric structure of a-synuclein associated
with Parkinson’s disease is a tetramer29. Thus, the current
study supports the concept that the native and physiological
conformations of proteins linked pathologically and genetically to
AD might also be altered in the disease. Stabilization of the
physiological structure might therefore be considered among
novel therapeutic approaches.
Methods
Animals. All mouse experiments were compliant with the requirements of the
Ethical Committee of Lund University. Experimental AD transgenic mouse group:
female Tg19959 mice, which harbour Swedish and Indiana familial AD mutations
(KM670/671NL and V717F) in human APP under the control of the hamster PrP
promoter12. Control group: female C57/B6SJL wild-type mice. Primary neuronal
cultures were derived from cerebral cortex and hippocampus of Tg (hAPPswe,
PSEN1dE9)85Dbo/Mmjax (APP/PS1; Jackson Labs) or wild-type mice at
embryonic day 15 as described30. All mice were screened for the presence
of the human APP695 transgene by PCR.
Experimental design. Brain material (sections or homogenates) of female
Tg19959 and wild-type mice at 1, 2 and 3 month of age, N of 3–4 animals per
genotype/age, were collected for the study. Brain sections were used for mFTIR and
immunofluorescence imaging; brain homogenates (cortex) were used for
biochemical studies.

 Experimental procedures. Female Tg19959 and wild-type mice were killed at 1, 2
and 3 month of age. Mice were deeply anaesthetized with 100 mg kg � 1 1:10
ketamine:xylazine administered by intraperitoneal injection. For mFTIR and
biochemical analysis, animals were first perfused transcardially with phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS), and then brains were removed from skulls and deeply frozen
in liquid nitrogen. For immunohistochemistry, brains were fixed by transcardial
perfusion with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4)
at room temperature (RT) and post-fixed by immersion in 4% PFA in 0.1 M PBS at
4 �C overnight.
Ab1-40 and Ab1-42 peptides. Synthetic Ab1-40 (DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVF
FAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVGGVV) was purchased from JPT (Germany). Stock
solution of 500 mM synthetic Ab1-40 (JPT) was prepared in 10 mM HEPES
(Sigma-Aldrich) with 0.02% NH3 at pH 11 (pH of the non-aggregated peptide
stock); aliquots were kept at � 80 �C until use. Ab1-40 oligomers were prepared in
the presence of ions of Cu(II) as described31, with a minor change: Cu2SO4 was
added in a stoichiometric ratio to Ab1-40 stock solution, and then pH was changed
to pH 7.4 to allow Ab aggregation.
Small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis of the Ab1-40 Cu(II)-induced
oligomers was done at the beamline X33 EMBL DESY synchrotron (Germany).
SAXS data was acquired for 1 mg ml � 1 Ab1-40-Cu(II)O in 10 mM Hepes pH 7.4
after 24 h of incubation at 37 �C before the experiment. The fit for the model
(spheres) was calculated using GNOM (ref. 32). De novo three-dimensional
reconstruction of the scattering entity of Ab1-40-Cu(II)-induced oligomers was
performed using DAMMIN (ref. 32) after 10 independent DAMMIN
reconstructions.
Synthetic Ab1-42 (DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVG
GVVIA) was purchased from Tocris Bioscience (USA). The peptides were
dissolved in cold DMSO (Sigma–Aldrich) at a concentration of 250 mM, divided
into aliquots of 50 ml and kept at at � 80 �C until use. Recombinant Ab1-42
(M-DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVGGVVIA), 20 mM in
20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), was a gift of Prof. Sara Linse (Lund University).
Recombinant Ab1-42 was prepared and purified as described33, and kept on ice
until use (1–2 h).
Fibril growth assays were initiated by placing the 96-well plate at 37 �C under
quiescent conditions. The ThT fluorescence was measured through the bottom of
the plate every 60 s with a 440 nm excitation filter and a 480 nm emission filter in a
plate reader (Fluostar Omega BMG Labtech). To monitor fibril formation,
Thioflavin T (ThT) kinetic assays were used. For ThT kinetics, 20 mM Ab1-42 was
incubated in the presence 6 mM ThT at 37 �C without agitation in a 96-well plate of
black polystyrene with a clear bottom and PEG coating (Corning 3881). Since ThT
fluorescence intensity at 480 nm is proportional to the mass of amyloid fibrils, the
kinetic evaluation of the aggregation reactions showed that after several hours of
incubation, Ab1-42 formed b-sheet fibrils. For mFTIR measurements, in parallel to
the ThT kinetic assays, Ab1-42 was incubated without adding ThT in low-bind
Eppendorf tubes at 37 �C under quiescent conditions.
Synchrotron-based lFTIR. Approximately 20 mm thick coronal brain
cryosections were mounted onto clean 1 � 1 mm2 CaF2 windows (Crystran Ltd.);
to avoid protein degradation sections were stored at � 80 �C until measurements
as described2. Sections were cryo-dried before measurements. Primary neurons
were seeded directly on CaF2 spectrophotometric windows and grown for 12 or
19 days. Cultures were washed with PBS, fixed for 20 min with 4% PFA in PBS,
washed with 20 mM phosphate buffer (PB) and stored at � 80 �C until
measurements. Samples with neurons were dried before measurements. Samples of
Ab1-42 monomers and fibrils were prepared in the same way as the mFTIR samples
from brain tissues. Approximately 5 mL drops of monomeric and fibrillar Ab1-42
fractions were placed on CaF2 spectrophotometric windows, snap frozen and
cryo-dried before measurements were taken.
mFTIR spectroscopy was performed at beamline D7, MAX-IV Laboratory,
Lund University, Sweden as described34,35. mFTIR spectra were collected from
mouse brain sections of cortex and CA1 hippocampus (as shown in Supplementary
Fig. 2a). The instrument set-up combines a Hyperion 3,000 microscope and a
Bruker IFS66/v FTIR spectrometer. First, mFTIR maps were recorded in off-line
mode using a conventional thermal light source for ‘overview mapping’ of larger
tissue areas (4–6 mm2) using 50 mm aperture diameter. Since the brightness of
conventional thermal infrared sources is inherently limited near the diffraction
limit, a synchrotron infrared source, which is about 100–1,000 times brighter than
a conventional thermal source, was used. The high flux density of the synchrotron
source allows smaller regions to be probed with an acceptable S/N ratio4. FTIR
spectra were collected from cultured neurons at MAX-IV Laboratory and the
SOLEIL synchrotron (Gif-sur-Yvette, France) using the SMIS beamline
(Supplementary Fig. 2d). The measuring range was 900 � 4,000 cm � 1 and the
spectra collection was done in transmission mode at 4 cm � 1 resolution, 8 � 8 mm2
aperture dimensions, from 500 to 1,000 co-added scans. Background spectra were
collected from a clean area of the same CaF2 window.
FTIR spectral analysis. Analysis of FTIR spectra was performed using the OPUS
software (Bruker). After atmospheric compensation, spectra exhibiting strong Mie
scattering were eliminated. For all spectra, a linear baseline correction was applied
from 1,200 to 2,000 cm � 1. After background subtraction and vector normalization,
derivation of the spectra to the second order was used to increase the number of
discriminative features to eliminate the baseline contribution. Derivation of the
spectra was achieved using a Savitsky � Golay algorithm with a nine-point filter
and a polynomial order of two. The b-aggregation level of proteins was studied by
calculating the peak intensity ratio between 1,620 and 1,640 cm � 1, corresponding
to b-sheet structures and the maximum corresponding mainly to a-helical content
at 1,656 cm � 1. An increase in the 1,620–1,640 cm � 1 component is considered a
signature of amyloid fibrils10,11,14,36. We were not able to detect changes in the
range of 1,690 cm � 1 that were previously described to differentiate antiparallel and
parallel Ab in a study on purified Ab using FTIR (ref. 37), likely due to the greater
complexity of the tissue samples.
Immunohistochemistry. PFA fixed mouse brains were cut into 40 mm thick
sections on a Leica SM 2010R freezing microtome. Sections were kept in storage
buffer composed of 30% sucrose and 30% ethylene glycol in PBS at � 20 �C until
use. Dual and triple immunolabelling combined with ThS of free-floating sections
were done as described in ref. 38 using optimal working dilutions recommended by
the manufacturer. Amyloid fibrils were visualized with rabbit polyclonal antibody
OC (Merck Millipore, AB2286); the free Ab42 C-terminus was recognized by
antibody 12F4 (BioLegend, Covance SIG-39142, 1/1,000); antibody 22C11 (Merck
Millipore, MAB 348) was used for the human/mouse APP N-terminus. For
pre-synaptic and post-synaptic labelling mouse monoclonal synaptophysin
antibody (Merck Millipore, MAB5258) and rabbit polyclonal drebrin antibody
(Abcam, AB11068) were used respectively. All primary antibodies are summarized
in Supplementary Table 1. For dual and triple label ThS staining, sections were
incubated in 0.001% ThS in 70% ethanol for 20 min, and then rinsed sequentially
with 70, 95 and 100% ethanol after immunofluorescent labelling as described38.
Confocal microscopy. Images were obtained using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal
microscope (Leica Microsystems) equipped with Diode 405/405 nm and Argon
(405, 488, 552 and 638 nm) lasers with an HP PL APO 63x/NA1.2 water immersion
objective. Autoquant (MediaCybernetics) was used for image deconvolution.
Two-dimensional images obtained by confocal microscopy were quantified and
reconstructed into 3D volumetric data sets using Imaris (Bitplane). Semi-opaque
iso-surfaces were defined individually for each channel from the deconvolved data
and rendered as semi-opaque, solid surfaces.
Biochemical analysis of mouse brain tissue. Forebrains were homogenized in
five volumes of buffer composed of 20 mM Tris–HCl, 50 mM NaCl pH 7.8 and
HaltTM protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After 30 min
incubation on ice, a first fraction was collected as a TBS dispersible fraction.
A TBS-T membrane-bound fraction was collected after the TBS insoluble pellet
was re-suspended in 1% Triton, 20 mM Tris–HCl, 50 mM NaCl at pH 7.4,
incubated 30 min on ice and centrifuged. To avoid artificial protein aggregation or
segregation, brain homogenates were centrifuged at low speed, at 10,000 g, at 4 �C
for 30 min as described24. Protein amounts were determined using BCA protein
assay (ThermoFisher Scientific). The protein load was also controlled by a parallel
SDS–PAGE blotted with b-actin (Sigma A5316, 1/5,000). Samples were used
immediately for BN- or SDS–PAGE and co-immunoprecipitation assays. For
BN-PAGE, only freshly prepared samples of 100 mg total protein in 4 � Native
PAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen) were electrophoretically resolved in a precast
native 4–16% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Native-Mark unstained protein standards (Invitrogen) were used as molecular
weight markers. Before protein transfer, the gels were washed with running buffer
containing 1% SDS for 20 min. The protein load was also controlled by a parallel
SDS–PAGE blotted with b-actin (Sigma A5316, 1/5,000). For SDS–PAGE, brain
homogenates (50 mg of total protein) were electrophoretically resolved in a precast
NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gel system (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred from
BN and SDS gels onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (iBlotR,
NovexR, Life Technologies). Unstained molecular weight markers were visualized
using Ponceau S (SigmaAldrich) and digitally marked due to faint bands on the
blue membranes. Membranes were boiled in PBS, pH 7.4 in a microwave oven for
5 min, and washed in PBS-TweenTM (Medicago). To block unspecific binding,
membranes were incubated in 5% non-fat dry milk (Sigma) diluted in PBS-Tween
for 1 h at RT. For immunodetection, membranes were incubated for 24 h at 4 �C
with primary antibodies against Ab/APP: 6E10 and 4G8 (BioLegend, Covance
#SIG-39300 and #SIG-39220 respectively, 1/1,000), human/mouse APP
N-terminus: 22C11 (Merck Millipore, MAB 348, 1/1,000), human APP: P2-1
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1/1,000), and human/mouse APP C-terminus antibody
369 (Supplementary Table, 1/1,000). The Ab N-terminus was recognized by
Ab/APP monoclonal antibody 82E1 (IBL International #18582, 1/1,000), and the
Ab42 C-terminus was recognized by Ab42 end-specific antibody from Life
Technologies (#700254, 1/1,000) and 12F4 (BioLegend, Covance, SIG-39142,
1/1,000); MBCAb42 (1/1,000); Chemicon (#AB5078, 1/1,000); primary antibodies
are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Blots were developed with enhanced
chemiluminescence (SuperSignalR West Femto) detection system (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Synthetic Ab1-42 (Tocris Bioscience) was used as positive and/or

 negative control. All BN-PAGE blots were developed with standard
chemiluminescence exposure times of 2–5 min, up to maximum exposure times of
1 h to detect even minor amounts of Ab. All western blots were performed at least
three times; only for the confirmation of the Ab band in Fig. 3b, three additional
Ab antibodies were used to confirm the 3 blots done with antibody 82E1 and to
show that this Ab includes Ab42. For quantification, 4 gels blotted with Ab42
antibodies were pooled together.
Statistical analysis. One-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post-hoc
comparison tests were performed in all statistical analysis. Since no significant
differences were found in the wild-type brains, the data from all the wild types were
pooled and used in the statistical calculations. Statistics with a value of Po0.01
were considered significant.
Data availability. The data that support the findings of this study are available
from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.
