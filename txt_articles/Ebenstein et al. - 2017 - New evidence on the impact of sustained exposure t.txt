This paper finds that a 10-μg/m3 increase in airborne particulate matter
[particulate matter smaller than 10 μm (PM10)] reduces life expectancy
by 0.64 years (95% confidence interval = 0.21–1.07). This estimate
is derived from quasiexperimental variation in PM10 generated by
China’s Huai River Policy, which provides free or heavily subsidized coal
for indoor heating during the winter to cities north of the Huai River
but not to those to the south. The findings are derived from a regres-
sion discontinuity design based on distance from the Huai River, and
they are robust to using parametric and nonparametric estimation
methods, different kernel types and bandwidth sizes, and adjustment
for a rich set of demographic and behavioral covariates. Furthermore,
the shorter lifespans are almost entirely caused by elevated rates of
cardiorespiratory mortality, suggesting that PM10 is the causal factor.
The estimates imply that bringing all of China into compliance with its
Class I standards for PM10 would save 3.7 billion life-years.

s airborne particulate matter (PM) today’s greatest environmental
risk to human health? Among the 5.9 billion people who live in
countries where PM readings are available, 4.5 billion are currently
exposed to PM concentrations that are at least twice the concentra-
tion that the WHO considers safe (1). The health effects of inhaling
PM have been widely studied and found to be robustly associated with
elevated risk of heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer (2–4). However,
questions regarding the health effects of PM and its appropriate
regulation continue to be of tremendous scientific and policy rele-
vance, because it is apparent that the existing evidence has not con-
vinced countries to adopt and enforce tough emission standards.
Current policies regarding PM also influence the probability that the
world will face disruptive climate change, because the combustion of
fossil fuels that causes PM also causes greenhouse gas emissions.
At least three limitations have plagued the existing evidence
linking health to air pollution, especially at the concentrations that
prevail in many of today’s developing countries. First, the literature is
almost entirely composed of observational studies, comparing pop-
ulations across locations with varying exposure to pollution. These
studies are likely to confound air pollution with unobserved deter-
minants of health that are correlated with pollution exposure (e.g.,
income, hospital quality, water pollution, etc.), such as has been
emphasized in a recent Science article (5). Second, the available
evidence is largely based on examinations of populations exposed to
the modest levels of PM that are commonly observed in developed
countries, where reliable pollution and health data are more readily
available (6). PM concentrations in many developing countries (e.g.,
India and China) are 5–10 times higher than in developed countries;
consequently, the existing evidence has little empirical relevance for
these countries if there is a nonlinear relationship between health
and pollution. Third, the most important questions about pollution
center on the impacts of sustained exposure (e.g., lifetime exposure).
However, there have been few opportunities to measure long-run
exposure to air pollution. [Notable exceptions include the works by
Dockery et al. (3) and Pope et al. (6, 7). However, these studies
have at least one of the following limitations: they (i) exploit ob-
servational variation in PM, (ii) use small samples, (iii) assume no
selective migration, or (iv) focus on low levels of pollution found in
the United States.] As a consequence, the existing literature fo-
cuses on shorter-run variation in PM exposure and often examines
outcomes (e.g., hospitalization, infant outcomes) that are only in-
directly related to longer-run outcomes, like life expectancy.
This paper estimates the effect of sustained exposure to particu-
late matter smaller than 10 μm (PM10) on life expectancy with recent
data from China and, in so doing, addresses each of the previous
literature’s limitations. First, the quasiexperimental research design is
based on China’s Huai River Policy. The policy was instituted during
the 1950s when economic resources were allocated through central
planning and dictated that areas to the north of the Huai River
received free or highly subsidized coal for indoor heating. This led to
the construction of a coal-powered centralized heating infrastructure
only in cities north of the Huai River, and no equivalent system is in
cities to the south; the legacy of that policy is evident even today,
with very different rates of indoor heating north and south of the
Huai River. Consequently, the findings are derived from a regression
discontinuity (RD) design based on distance from the Huai River.
Significance
An estimated 4.5 billion people are currently exposed to particu-
late matter (PM) levels at least twice the concentration that the
WHO considers safe. Existing evidence linking health to air pollu-
tion is largely based on populations exposed to only modest levels
of PM and almost entirely composed of observational studies,
which are likely to confound air pollution with other unobserved
determinants of health. This study uses quasiexperimental varia-
tion in particulate matter smaller than 10 μm (PM10) generated by
an arbitrary Chinese policy to find that a 10-μg/m3 increase in PM10
reduces life expectancy by 0.64 years. The estimates imply
that bringing all of China into compliance with its Class I standards
for PM10 would save 3.7 billion life-years.

 Second, the average PM10 concentration in China during
the examined period is 103 μg/m3 (i.e., more than five times the
WHO standard), and, therefore, the results are informative for the
1.36 billion people currently living in China as well as the several
billion other people who are exposed to high PM10 concentrations
around the world. Furthermore, the analysis is conducted with the
most comprehensive data file ever compiled on health and pollu-
tion in a developing country (Fig. 1).
Third, the Huai River Policy produces sustained differences in
PM10 concentrations between the areas north and south of the river
that date back to China’s first measurement of airborne PM in the
early 1980s (and very likely earlier) and persist even today. Impor-
tantly, the mortality data cover the years 2004–2012 when restrictions
on migration had been loosened, but Disease Surveillance Points
(DSP) mortality was still generally recorded at an individual’s birth-
place or hukou (additional details are in SI Appendix). The possibility
of individuals moving away from their hukou, as a compensatory re-
sponse to high levels of air pollution, but still having their death
recorded at their birthplace means that this study provides an answer
to a central question: what are the effects of PM10 concentrations at a
person’s birthplace on their life expectancy? Because individuals can
migrate and undertake other compensatory responses to air pollution,
the resulting estimates of the effect of PM10 on life expectancy are
more likely to be externally valid to other countries than estimates
from earlier periods when Chinese migration was greatly restricted (8).
The analysis indicates that PM10 exposure causes people to live
substantially shorter and sicker lives at the concentrations present
today in China and other developing countries. We estimate that
the Huai River Policy generates an increase in PM10 exposure of
41.7 μg/m3 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 16.4–67.0] and a
decline of 3.1 years (95% CI = 1.3–4.9) in life expectancy just to the
north of the river. Furthermore, the elevated mortality rates are
concentrated among cardiorespiratory causes of death, whereas there
is little evidence of a difference in mortality rates for causes that are
not plausibly related to air pollution. More broadly, the results suggest
that long-term exposure to an additional 10 μg/m3 is associated with a
0.64-year (95% CI = 0.21–1.07) decline in life expectancy.
This paper improves on the work by Chen et al. (8), which also
exploits the Huai River Policy to measure the health impact of total
suspended particulates (TSPs), by examining the health consequences
of smaller particles that comprise PM10 and using significantly more
accurate measures of mortality from a more recent time period (2004–
2012) with a coverage population roughly eight times larger. We also
probed the robustness of the results in several new and important
ways, including but not limited to adjustment for important health
behaviors (e.g., smoking), the choice of parametric vs. nonparametric
estimation methods (9), a placebo exercise that finds that the dis-
continuity in pollution and life expectancy is only evident at the river
itself, and a bounding exercise that allows for the possibility that pol-
lution is correlated with an unobservable determinant of health (10).
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Data Sources describes
the data sources, whereas Econometric Model outlines the empiri-
cal strategy. Empirical Results presents the results, and Conclusion
provides some conclusions.
Data Sources
The heart of the analysis is based on two data files that together
provide location-specific information on life expectancy, health,
and air pollution. The mortality and life expectancy data come
from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(Chinese CDC) DSP survey. The DSP is a remarkably high-quality
nationally representative survey; it provides detailed cause of death
data (verified by verbal autopsy) for a coverage population of over
73 million people at 161 separate locations for each year between
2004 and 2012. The cause of death information recorded in the
autopsies is used to assign all deaths to either cardiorespiratory
causes of death (i.e., heart, stroke, lung cancers, and respiratory
illnesses) that are plausibly related to air pollution exposure or
noncardiorespiratory causes (i.e., cancers other than lung and all
other causes). The latter are used as a placebo-style test.
The air pollution data were compiled by combining print and
electronic resources for six main pollutants over the period 1981–
2012. To estimate the impacts of long-run exposure to pollution, the
location-level panel data are collapsed to a 154-observation, location-
level, cross-sectional dataset; the panel data are collapsed in this
manner, because the Huai River RD design is fundamentally a cross-
sectional design. These collapsed measures of PM10 for each DSP
are available in SI Appendix and are based on what we believe is the
most comprehensive archive of Chinese air pollution ever assembled.
Three other datasets are used to adjust the estimates for potential
confounders. Measures of health-relevant behavior, such as smoking
prevalence and dietary patterns, are taken from a Chinese CDC
survey conducted in 2010. This survey is almost ideal for this study’s
purposes, because it was designed to capture patterns in behavior
specifically for the coverage population at each DSP location. We
use the 2005 census as a secondary dataset, which enables us to
adjust the estimates for demographic covariates included in the
census and not available from the Chinese CDC survey (e.g., share
minority, average years of education). Finally, we consider other
local factors that are plausibly related to health in China, including
surface water pollution grade from China’s Environmental Year-
books (2004–2012). SI Appendix describes the data in greater detail.
Econometric Model
We use two approaches to estimating the relationship between
PM10 and health outcomes. The first approach is a “conventional”
strategy that uses ordinary least squares (OLS) to fit the following
equation to the cross-sectional data file:
Yj = β0 + β1PMj + XjΓ + «j,
[1]
where j references a DSP location in China. PMj is the PM10 concen-
tration in city j, Xj is a vector of the observable characteristics of the
location that might influence health outcomes other than air quality,
and «j is a disturbance term. The dependent variable Yj is either a
measure of mortality rates in DSP location j or its residents’ life
expectancy, which is a simple function of age-specific mortality rates.

 The coefficient β1 measures the effect of PM10 exposure on mor-
tality after controlling for the available covariates. Consistent estima-
tion of β1 requires that unobserved determinants of mortality do not
covary with PMj after adjustment for Xj. Thus, the conventional ap-
proach rests on the assumption that linear adjustment for the limited
set of variables available in the census removes all sources of con-
founding. Previous research has raised substantive concerns about the
validity of this assumption (5, 11). Furthermore, pollution concentra-
tions are measured with error, and it is well-known that classical
measurement error will attenuate the coefficient associated with PM10.
The second approach leverages the RD design implicit in the
Huai River Policy to measure its impact on PM10 concentrations
and life expectancy. The RD design was developed more than five
decades ago and has been used successfully to test the causal na-
ture of relationships in a wide range of fields, including psychology,
education, statistics, biostatistics, and economics (12, 13).
This paper’s RD design exploits the Huai River Policy that provides
free or heavily subsidized coal for indoor heating north of the river
and no subsidies to the south. Specifically, we separately test whether
the Huai River Policy caused discontinuous changes in PM10 and life
expectancy to the north of the river. The respective necessary as-
sumptions are that any unobserved determinants of PM10 or mortality
change smoothly as they cross the river. If the relevant assumption is
valid, adjustment for a sufficiently flexible polynomial in distance from
the river or local linear regressions on either side of the river will
remove all potential sources of bias and allow for causal inference.
In practice, we estimate the following parametric equations to
test for the impacts of the Huai River Policy:
PMj = α0 + α1Nj + f
�
Lj
�
+ Nj f
�
Lj
�
+ Xjγ + uj
[2a]
Yj = δ0 + δ1Nj + f
�
Lj
�
+ Nj f
�
Lj
�
+ Xjφ + «j,
[2b]
where j references a DSP location in China. PMj is the average
annual ambient concentration of PM10 in location j over the
period 2004–2012, and Yj is a measure of location j’s mortality
rate or life expectancy at birth. Nj is an indicator variable equal
to one for locations that are north of the Huai River line, fðLjÞ is
a polynomial in degrees north of the Huai River that is inter-
acted with Nj (chosen based on goodness of fit criteria), and Xj is
a vector of the demographic and city characteristics other than
air quality that are associated with mortality rates.
An alternative estimation strategy for the RD approach involves
nonparametric identification of [2a] and [2b]. For example, con-
sider the following setup for estimation by local linear regression:
PMj = α0 + α1Nj + α2Lj + α3NjLj + uj
[3a]
Yj = δ0 + δ1Nj + δ2Lj + δ3NjLj + «j,
[3b]
such that Lj is within h latitude degrees of the Huai River. We
rely on a choice rule, which determines the optimal h as a
function of the data (14, 15). Additionally, we report results
using three separate kernels or weighting functions—triangle,
uniform, and Epanechnikov.
Finally, we also report results from the parametric RD approach
described in Eqs. 2a and 2b that restricts the sample to locations
within 5° latitude of the Huai River; this sample restriction is an
informal way of implementing the local linear methods that use
bandwidths and kernels to focus comparisons near the discontinuity.
Empirical Results reports on estimation of Eqs. 2a, 2b, 3a, and 3b
for PM10, life expectancy at birth, and several other outcomes of
interest, such as cardiorespiratory mortality. The parameters of
interest are α1 and δ1, which provide an estimate of whether there is
a discontinuity in outcomes at locations just to the north of the
Huai River relative to locations to the south. If the RD assumptions
hold, estimates of δ1 will provide an unbiased estimate of the life
expectancy consequences of birth in a location just to the north of
the Huai River. Importantly, this parameter is not a laboratory-style
estimate of the consequences of exposure to air pollution where all
other factors are held constant, because it reflects individuals’ ac-
tions to protect themselves from the resulting health problems of
pollution. Although the laboratory-style estimate might be of in-
terest for researchers interested in how PM affects the human body,
its relevance for understanding the real world consequences of air
pollution is unclear. In fact, an appealing feature of the estimates of
δ1 is that they reflect all of the compensatory behavior that indi-
viduals undertake to protect themselves from air pollution, in-
cluding migration to less polluted locations and other defensive
measures, such as purchasing indoor air purifiers (16).
Importantly, the results in Eqs. 2a, 2b, 3a, and 3b can each be
used to develop estimates of the impact of PM10 concentrations on
life expectancy. Specifically, if the Huai River Policy only influences

The sample is restricted to DSP locations (n = 154) within 150 km of an air quality monitoring station. The results in column [4] are adjusted for a cubic in degrees of
latitude north of the Huai River boundary, which is allowed to vary north and south of the boundary. In column [5], we report the estimated discontinuity at the Huai
River using local linear regression with a triangular kernel and bandwidth selected by the method proposed by Imbens and Kalyanaraman (14) chosen separately for
each variable. Differences in predicted life expectancy are calculated by OLS using all of the covariates in SI Appendix, Table S1. The local linear joint test of equality uses
the same set of covariates and bandwidth selection method proposed by Imbens and Kalyanaraman (14) with a uniform kernel.

 mortality through its impact on PM10, then it is valid to treat Eq. 2a
as the first stage in a two-stage least squares (2SLS) system of
equations. The appeal of the 2SLS approach is that it produces
estimates of the impact of units of PM10 on life expectancy, and
therefore, the results are applicable to other settings (e.g., India and
other developing countries with comparable PM10 concentrations).

PMj represents the fitted values from estimating [2a]; the
other variables are as described above. The 2SLS approach of-
fers the prospect of solving the confounding or omitted variables
problem associated with the estimation of the air pollution
health effects relationship and is a solution to the attenuation
bias associated with the mismeasurement of PM10.
A nonparametric analog to [2c] can be estimated by taking the
ratio of the estimated discontinuity in life expectancy to the esti-
mated discontinuity in PM10, with both estimated by local linear
regression. The result is an instrumental variable (IV) Wald esti-
mate of the impact of PM10 on life expectancy that is analogous to
the 2SLS estimates produced in [2c], and it is based on the rec-
ommendations of Calonico et al. (17) for implementing a “fuzzy
RD.” Generally, this approach is used to assess the impact of a
binary treatment where the probability of treatment rises at some
threshold but being above or below the threshold does not fully
determine treatment status. In our context, exposure to PM10 in-
creases significantly at the Huai River, but pollution exists south
and north of the river, making our context naturally analogous to a
fuzzy RD, where the ratio is estimated as the ratio of two “sharp”
discontinuities; in practice, we use the optimal bandwidth for life
expectancy as the bandwidth for both life expectancy and PM10.
The work by Calonico et al. (15) has additional details.
Empirical Results
Assessing the Validity of the Huai River RD Design. Table 1 reports
the summary statistics for PM10 exposure at DSP locations and
provides evidence on the validity of the RD design. Columns [1]
and [2] report the means along with the SDs in locations north and
south of the Huai River line. Column [3] reports the mean dif-
ferences between the north and the south along with the associated
SEs. Column [4] also reports the differences (and SEs), but here,
they are adjusted for a cubic polynomial in degrees north of the
Huai River that is allowed to vary north and south of the river, so
that it is a test for a discontinuous change at the Huai River line.
Column [5] reports the discontinuous change at the Huai River
line using local linear regression to estimate the size of the dis-
continuity estimated with a triangular kernel and bandwidth se-
lection method prescribed by Imbens and Kalyanaraman (14).
There are large differences in PM10 exposure among southern and
northern Chinese residents. In contrast, SI Appendix, Table S1 shows
that concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide are statis-
tically equivalent on both sides of the river after implementation of
either the parametric or nonparametric RD approach. A potential
explanation is that both sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide are gas-
eous air pollutants that are lighter and travel farther than PM10.
Therefore, PM10 exposure can be isolated from other air pollutants as
a potential health risk caused by living north of the Huai River.
A direct test of the RD design’s identifying assumption that
unobservables change smoothly at the boundary is, of course, im-
possible, but it would nevertheless be reassuring if observable de-
terminants change smoothly at the boundary. (This is analogous to
the test in randomized control trials that observable determinants
of the outcome are independent of treatment status.) SI Appendix,
Table S1 reports on the full set of individual covariates, whereas
Table 1 provides two approaches to summarize differences in the
available covariates and test for a discontinuity to the north of the
river in these variables. The second row reports predicted life ex-
pectancy based on all of the potential covariates that collectively
explain a substantial portion of the variation in life expectancy (R2 =
0.35). However, the null hypothesis of equal predicted life ex-
pectancies on the north and south sides of the river is not rejected

 with either application of the RD design. The third row reports P
values from a joint test that the covariates are equal on the two
sides of the river for all of the available covariates. The results of
this test are less conclusive; they indicate that the null hypothesis of
no difference in the covariates can be rejected using the polynomial
application of the RD design but cannot be rejected using the local
linear regression approach. These findings lend greater support to
emphasizing the results from the local linear regression application
of the RD design, but as an additional check, we probe the ro-
bustness of the results in several ways below.
Estimates of the Effect of the Huai River Policy on PM10, Life Expectancy,
and Cause-Specific Mortality Rates. We begin the analysis graphically
with an assessment of the Huai River Policy’s impact on pollution.
Fig. 2 plots PM10 at DSP locations against their degrees north of the
Huai River line. The circles in Fig. 2 represent the average PM10
concentration across locations within 1°-latitude distance bins from
the Huai River; each circle’s size is proportional to the population
at the DSP locations within the relevant bin. The plotted line in Fig.
2 is generated by using a kernel-weighted local linear regression on
either side of the river, which is similar to a nonparametric RD
approach. This is estimated with a triangular kernel and bandwidth
chosen by the method prescribed by Imbens and Kalyanaraman
(14). Fig. 2 reveals a discontinuous change in ambient PM10 con-
centrations to the north of the river; it indicates that the Huai River
Policy increased PM10 concentrations by about 42 μg/m3.
The plot in Fig. 3 is almost a mirror image of Fig. 2. It reveals a
striking discrete decline in life expectancy at the border of roughly
3 years. Together, Figs. 2 and 3 reveal a sharp increase in PM10
and a sharp decline in life expectancy at precisely the location
where the Huai River Policy went into effect.
Table 2 statistically summarizes the graphical findings in Figs. 2
and 3 by reporting estimates (and SEs) associated with the north
indicator variable from fitting equations for several variables of
interest using a variety of RD approaches. Columns [1] and [2]
apply the parametric RD approach from Eqs. 2a and 2b using the
full sample and a subsample of DSP locations within 5° latitude of
the Huai River, respectively. The estimates are adjusted for the full
set of available covariates. We focus on specifications where lati-
tude is interacted with the north dummy, so that latitude is allowed
to affect outcomes differently north and south of the Huai River.
In both samples, we use the Akaike Information Criteria of
goodness of fit for life expectancy to choose the functional form for
the polynomial in latitude, which recommends a cubic polynomial
and linear term in columns [1] and [2] respectively. Column
[3] reports on the estimated discontinuity at the Huai River using
local linear regression with a triangular kernel and bandwidth
selected by the method proposed by Imbens and Kalyanaraman
(14). This nonparametric approach has the benefit that no func-
tional form needs be imposed on the data. Furthermore, it places
greater weight on DSP locations near the Huai River.
Table 2 presents evidence of significant increases in PM10 and
decreases in life expectancy at the Huai River. At the boundary,
PM10 rises by 27/32 μg/m3 and life expectancy declines by
2.4/2.2 years in the full and restricted samples, respectively. The
decline in life expectancy is driven by a statistically significant in-
crease in cardiorespiratory mortality rates of 30/22% at the
boundary in the full and restricted samples, respectively (Table 2,
Cardiorespiratory). In contrast, there is little systematic evidence of
a meaningful discontinuity in noncardiorespiratory mortality rates
north of the river. The estimates from the nonparametric approach
tend to be of similar magnitude: the estimated increase in PM10
north of the river is 42 μg/m3, whereas the decline in life expectancy
is 3.1 years and again, driven by elevated cardiorespiratory mortality
rates. SI Appendix, Table S7 shows a fuller set of results, all of which
are qualitatively similar.
A powerful placebo test to assess the significance of these findings
is to explore whether discontinuities are observed in other regions of
China. Fig. 4 reports on the estimated discontinuities in PM10 and
life expectancy at 1°-latitude intervals north and south of the Huai
River across China as well as at the actual Huai River (which is
reported as the 0° displacement). The discontinuities are estimated
from versions of Eqs. 3a and 3b using a triangular kernel and the
bandwidth selection approach of Imbens and Kalyanaraman (14).
Fig. 4 shows that the only statistically significant discontinuous
changes in PM10 and life expectancy occur at the actual Huai River.
In all other instances, an estimated effect of zero is within the 95%
CI. These results provide additional evidence that the effects in
Figs. 2 and 3 and Table 2 are because of the Huai River Policy
rather than an artifact of this application of the RD approach.
Estimates of the Effect of PM10 on Life Expectancy. Table 3 reports
on the estimated effect of 10 μg/m3 PM10 on life expectancy and
cardiorespiratory mortality rates from alternative estimation ap-
proaches. Column [1] reports on the conventional OLS approach
detailed in Eq. 1 and provides a basis for comparison with the RD
IV or 2SLS approaches reported in columns [2] and [3].
The RD IV and 2SLS approaches suggest a substantially larger
estimate of the health effects of PM10. Specifically, the OLS esti-
mate suggests that an additional 10 μg/m3 sustained exposure to
PM10 is associated with a statistically significant decline in life ex-
pectancy of 0.27 years. The column [2] estimate from the parametric

In column [1], we report OLS estimates of the association between PM10 and
the listed outcome. In column [2], we report the 2SLS IV estimates using north
of the Huai River as the IV and a cubic polynomial in degrees latitude from the
Huai River interacted with a north dummy variable. In column [3], we estimate
the impact of PM10 on the listed outcomes using local linear regression (LLR),
treating distance from the Huai River as the forcing variable and PM10 as the
treatment variable, with the Huai River representing a “fuzzy” discontinuity in
the level of PM10 exposure. Results are reported in terms of the impact of an
additional 10 μg/m3 long-term PM10 exposure. Results in columns [1] and [2] are
based on the full sample (n = 154) and include the covariates listed in SI Ap-
pendix, Table S1. Column [3] is based on the bandwidth selection method pro-
posed by Imbens and Kalyanaraman (14) with a triangular kernel.

Ebenstein et al.
 RD IV approach indicates that an additional 10 μg/m3 PM10 re-
duces life expectancy by 0.86 years, which is significant at the 10%
level. The estimated effect from the favored nonparametric ap-
proach is −0.64 years and would be judged highly statistically sig-
nificant by conventional criteria. The larger magnitude of these IV
estimates suggests that some combination of omitted variables (e.g.,
more polluted areas are richer) and measurement error reduces the
magnitude of the OLS estimates relative to the true effect of PM10
on life expectancy. SI Appendix, Table S8 shows a fuller set of results.
Robustness and Interpretation. SI Appendix explores heterogeneity in
the results across different populations as well as the results’ sensi-
tivity to a rich set of robustness checks. Among the wide set of these
results, we find that estimates do not differ significantly between sexes
(SI Appendix, Tables S4 and S5), the impacts on cardiorespiratory
mortality rates are generally evident over the entire course of the
lifecycle (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 and Table S6), and different para-
metric and nonparametric applications of the RD design support the
choice of polynomials in latitude in Tables 2 and 3 (SI Appendix,
Table S9) and the robustness of the local linear regression results to
different bandwidth selection methods and alternative choices of
kernels (SI Appendix, Tables S10 and S11). Furthermore, the results
are not very sensitive to our pollution assignment method or choice
of acceptable distance from a monitoring station (SI Appendix, Tables
S12 and S13), expanding the sample to include sites that are not near
any pollution monitor (SI Appendix, Table S14), limiting the sample
to data with more recent pollution data (SI Appendix, Table S15), or
removing observations where PM10 is imputed from TSP (SI Ap-
pendix, Table S16). We also examined how the results are affected by
using residual life expectancy as the outcome, which enables an ex-
amination of how local linear regression results are affected by the
inclusion of covariates (SI Appendix, Table S17), and the results again
remain qualitatively similar to the main results. SI Appendix, Tables
S18 and S19 verify that the results are robust to inclusion of a control
for distance of each DSP site from the coast and that the Huai River
did not serve as a demarcation line for changes in other government
policies that could confound the estimates of PM10 on health.
SI Appendix, Tables S20 and S21 explore the potential impact
of migration on the estimates using information in the 2005 census
on respondents’ place of origin, place of current residence, and
timing of migration. Although these results are from a different
dataset, they suggest that the degree of compensatory migration
in response to the higher PM10 levels induced by the Huai River
Policy was limited during this period and that pollution con-
centrations at an individual’s birthplace or hukou are likely to be
a reliable measure of their lifetime exposure to pollution. It is
worth noting that, because roughly 1.5% of deaths are registered
outside an individual’s birth hukou, we cannot entirely rule out
the possibility that selective migration could influence our point
estimates. Nevertheless, the results of these tests suggest that
compensatory migration is unlikely to significantly bias the esti-
mates of the effect of the Huai River Policy on lifetime PM10
exposure or in turn, the IV estimates of the effect of PM10 on
life expectancy.
SI Appendix, Table S22 presents the results of bounding tests to
consider how the point estimates would change if there are un-
observed differences among the populations south and north of
the river following the proposed method by Oster (10). The results
fail to contradict the paper’s qualitative findings and are presented
in detail in SI Appendix.
Finally, SI Appendix explores the relationship between the es-
timates presented here and those in the work by Chen et al. (8). It
is noteworthy that the application of the Huai River RD design
produces estimates of the relationship between airborne PM and
life expectancy that are qualitatively identical, despite the fact that
they are derived from two different decades.
Conclusion
The analysis suggests that the Huai River Policy, which had the
laudable goal of providing indoor heat, had disastrous conse-
quences for human health. Specifically, it led to PM10 concentra-
tions that are 41.7 μg/m3 (95% CI = 16.4–67.0) or 46% higher in
the north and reductions in life expectancies of 3.1 years (95%
CI = 1.3–4.9) in the north caused by elevated rates of cardiore-
spiratory mortality. More broadly, the results suggest that sus-
tained exposure to an additional 10 μg/m3 PM10 is associated with
a 0.64-year (95% CI = 0.21–1.07) decline in life expectancy.
The implications of these results for human wellbeing are po-
tentially enormous. The application of the paper’s estimates suggests
that bringing all of China into compliance with their Class I PM10
standard of 40 μg/m3 would lead to a gain of 3.7 billion life-years for
their current population. Furthermore, a growing body of evidence
finds that individuals devote substantial resources to protecting
themselves from air pollution, and these defensive expenditures
represent very real costs of air pollution that are in addition to the
direct mortality and morbidity effects (16, 18).
The risks to life expectancy from PM exposure are not confined
to China. In total, more than 4.5 billion people live in countries
with average PM10 concentrations that are at least twice the
concentration that the WHO considers safe. This paper’s results
suggest that, for most people in the world, there is currently no
greater environmental risk to health than airborne PM.
