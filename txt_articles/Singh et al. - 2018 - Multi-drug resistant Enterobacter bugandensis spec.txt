Abstract
Background: The antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypic properties, multiple drug resistance (MDR) gene
profiles, and genes related to potential virulence and pathogenic properties of five Enterobacter bugandensis strains
isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) were carried out and compared with genomes of three clinical
strains. Whole genome sequences of ISS strains were characterized using the hybrid de novo assembly of Nanopore
and Illumina reads. In addition to traditional microbial taxonomic approaches, multilocus sequence typing (MLST)
analysis was performed to classify the phylogenetic lineage. Agar diffusion discs assay was performed to test
antibiotics susceptibility. The draft genomes after assembly and scaffolding were annotated with the Rapid
Annotations using Subsystems Technology and RNAmmer servers for downstream analysis.
Results: Molecular phylogeny and whole genome analysis of the ISS strains with all publicly available Enterobacter
genomes revealed that ISS strains were E. bugandensis and similar to the type strain EB-247T and two clinical
isolates (153_ECLO and MBRL 1077). Comparative genomic analyses of all eight E. bungandensis strains showed, a
total of 4733 genes were associated with carbohydrate metabolism (635 genes), amino acid and derivatives (496
genes), protein metabolism (291 genes), cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments (275 genes), membrane
transport (247 genes), and RNA metabolism (239 genes). In addition, 112 genes identified in the ISS strains were
involved in virulence, disease, and defense. Genes associated with resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds,
including the MDR tripartite system were also identified in the ISS strains. A multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR)
locus or MAR operon encoding MarA, MarB, MarC, and MarR, which regulate more than 60 genes, including
upregulation of drug efflux systems that have been reported in Escherichia coli K12, was also observed in the ISS
strains.

Conclusion: Given the MDR results for these ISS Enterobacter genomes and increased chance of pathogenicity
(PathogenFinder algorithm with > 79% probability), these species pose important health considerations for future
missions. Thorough genomic characterization of the strains isolated from ISS can help to understand the
pathogenic potential, and inform future missions, but analyzing them in in-vivo systems is required to discern the
influence of microgravity on their pathogenicity.

Background
Enterobacter
species
are
facultative
anaerobic,
Gram-stain-negative, and saprophytic microorganisms
found in soil, sewage, and as a commensal enteric flora
of the human gastrointestinal tract [1]. They have been
associated with nosocomial infection in humans, causing
bacteremia, endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis,
skin and soft tissue infections, lower respiratory tract,
urinary tract, and intra-abdominal infections [2, 3].
Some Enterobacter have also been reported plant patho-
gens [4]. Antibiotic resistance and its clinical implica-
tions
have
been
extensively
studied
in
genus
Enterobacter, especially Enterobacter cloacae, which is
resistant to cephalosporins, ampicillin, amoxicillin, and
cefoxitin [5, 6].
In an ongoing effort of the International Space Station
(ISS) Microbial Observatory investigation, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is catalog-
ing
the
total
and
viable
microbial
communities
of
crew-associated environments using cultivation and mo-
lecular techniques of microbial detection [7, 8]. As a result,
five isolates belonging to the Enterobacter bugandensis
group of bacteria from two different locations of the ISS
were isolated [9]. Since the initial molecular screening iden-
tified these strains as Enterobacter but the identification
was not able to resolve their taxonomy to species level, de-
tailed genomic characterizations were warranted in addition
to the traditional microbiological characterization. Due to
its unstable taxonomic structure, methods utilized for the
speciation of Enterobacter varied widely. Commercial bio-
chemical typing systems such as API® 20E [10] or Vitek® 2,
and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of
flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) [11] methods
have been used, but with limited success. On the basis of
16S rRNA analysis, Enterobacter was structured as a poly-
phyletic genus and most of the species could not be re-
solved [1]. Therefore, multilocus sequence typing (MLST)
analysis was found to be more appropriate for phylogenetic
classification of Enterobacter species [12].
To resolve this question further, whole genome se-
quencing (WGS) and de novo assembly was performed
on all five ISS E. bugandensis strains, creating MLST and
genome variation profiles of the ISS strains [13]. Fur-
thermore, comparative genome alignment of the ISS
strains with all publicly available 1291 Enterobacter ge-
nomes revealed that genomes of these five ISS strains
were highly similar to only three clinical E. bugandensis
with very high genome similarities and formed a unique
ecotype. They are (a) EB-247 strain [13], isolated from
neonatal
blood
of
a
patient
from
Tanzania,
(b)
153_ECLO strain [14], isolated from the urine of a neo-
natal patient strain admitted to the University of Wash-
ington Medical Center, Seattle, WA and (c) MBRL 1077
strain, a carbapenemase-producing strain [15] isolated
from the wound of a 72-year-old woman with a history
of cutaneous scleroderma, medically complicated obes-
ity, and venous insufficiency. In this study, comparative
genomic analyses of five ISS strains and three clinical
isolates were carried out to elucidate antimicrobial re-
sistance (AMR) phenotypic properties, MDR gene pro-
files, and genes related to potential virulence and
pathogenic potential of the ISS Enterobacter strains.
Methods
Sample collection from ISS environmental surfaces, pro-
cessing, cultivation of bacteria were already reported [9].
When 105 bacterial strains isolated from various ISS lo-
cations were analyzed for their phylogenetic affiliations,
five isolates were identified as Enterobacter bugandensis.
The five Enterobacter isolates characterized during this
study were isolated from two different locations of the
ISS flight in March 2015. Four isolates were isolated
from the waste and hygiene compartment (WHC), and
one strain from the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device
(ARED) foot platform of ISS.
Phenotypic characterization
The isolates were biochemically identified using Vitek®2
Compact gram-negative (GN) cards (bioMerieux, Inc.,
Hazelwood, MO) [16] and BioLog (Hayward, CA) car-
bon substrate utilization profile characterization [17].
Sample preparation for MALDI-TOF MS protein ana-
lysis was carried out as previously established [18].
MALDI-TOF mass spectra were obtained from an Ultra-
flex III instrument (Bruker Daltonik, Billerica, MA) op-
erated in linear positive mode under Flex-Control 3.1
software.

software (version 3.1; Bruker Daltonik).
Genome sequence analysis
Genomic DNA extraction was performed as described
previously [9]. WGS was performed on the Oxford
Nanopore
MinION (Oxford, United
Kingdom)
and
Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform (San Diego, CA). A
hybrid approach was utilized for genome assembly using
reads from both platforms. Nanopore reads were proc-
essed using Poretools [19] toolkit for the purposes of
quality control and downstream analysis. Error corrected
Nanopore
and
MiSeq
reads
were
assembled
using
SPAdes [20]. Scaffolding of the assembled contigs was
done using SSpace [21] and gap filling was executed
using GapFiller [22]. The draft genomes after assembly
and scaffolding were annotated with the help of the
Rapid
Annotations
using
Subsystems
Technology
(RAST) [23] and RNAmmer servers [24] for down-
stream analysis [25, 26] ISS strains assembly characteris-
tics are given in Additional file 1: Table S1. The 16S
rRNA, gyrB, and rpoB gene sequences were retrieved
from the WGS and analyzed for their phylogenetic affili-
ations. The neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis was
performed using the MEGA7 software package [27].
MLST analysis was carried out as described previously
[28]. The MLST scheme employed here uses seven
house-keeping genes: dnaA (DNA replication initiator),
fusA (codes Elongation factor G), gyrB (DNA replication
and repair), leuS (Leucine tRNA ligase), pyrG (CTP syn-
thase), rplB (50S ribosomal protein), and rpoB (β subunit
of bacterial RNA polymerase) [29]. The retrieved se-
quences were compared with the sequence types depos-
ited at E. cloacae MLST database [30], concatenated
according to the MLST scheme. The genes were ana-
lyzed independently, or as a single concatenate using
neighbor-joining algorithms.
The SNP-based phylogenetic tree was generated using
CSIPhylogeny [28] version 1.4. Using genome sequences
of multiple isolates CSIPhylogeny calls SNP, filters the
SNPs, performs site validation, and infers a phylogeny
based on the concatenated alignment of high-quality
SNPs. The analysis included Enterobacter reference whole
genome sequences which were downloaded from the
NCBI GenBank database. This genome-wide SNP analysis
allows for higher resolution phylogenetic analysis com-
pared to other methods, which is necessary for comparing
highly similar genomes. All positions containing gaps and
missing data were eliminated. A total of 3832 positions in
the dataset were used to confer the final tree.
Hybrid-genome-assembly (ONT and Illumina data) of
strain IF3SW-P2 was nominated as reference genome of
the 5 strains sequenced. The IF3SW-P2 genome was
used to realign the Illumina MiSeq reads with reads of
other 4 strains using bwa-mem (http://bio-bwa.source-
forge.net/). Postprocessing of the BAM files was per-
formed
using
SAMtools
[31]
and
picard
(https://
github.com/broadinstitute/picard). GATK HaplotypeCal-
ler (https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/) was used
for SNP and indels identification.
Pairwise average nucleotide index (ANI) was calcu-
lated using the algorithm from Goris et al. 2007 [32] and
GC content was determined using EzTaxon-e [33].
Digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) was performed
using the Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator 2.0
(GGDC 2.0) [34]. Briefly, the genome sequences in
FASTA format were submitted to GGDC 2.0 along with
the sequences in FASTA format for the Enterobacter refer-
ence genome that were available: E. aerogenes KCTC
2190, E. asburiae ATCC 35953, E. bugandensis EB-247T,
E. cancerogenus ATCC 35316, E. cloacae ATCC 13047, E.
hormaechei ATCC 49162, E. kobei DSM 13645, E. lignoly-
ticus SCF1, E. ludwigii EN119, E. massiliensis JC163, E.
mori LMG25706, E. muelleri JM-458T, E. xiangfangensis
LMG 27195, and E. soli ATCC BAA-2102. The results
were obtained by comparing query genomes (ISS isolates)
with each of the reference genomes to calculate dDDH
and intergenomic distances. Global comparison of ISS iso-
lates with other species was done using local BLAST [35].
Genome
sequence
assemblies
were
aligned
using
BLASTN and the diagrammatic view was created using
BLAST Ring Image Generator (BRIG) software [36].
Nucleotide sequence deposition
The WGS data submitted to the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank and NASA
GenLab databases were downloaded and characterized
during this study. The complete genome sequences of all
ISS strains were deposited in NCBI under Bioproject
PRJNA319366 as well as at the NASA GeneLab system
(GLDS-67; https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/ac-
cession/GLDS-67/#). The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ acces-
sion numbers for the 16S rRNA gene sequence of
isolated strains are: IF2SW-B1 (KY218809), IF2SW-B5
(KY218813),
IF2SW-P2
T
(KY218815),
IF2SW-P3
(KY218816), and IF3SW-P2 (KY218819).
Results
Phenotypic characteristics
The ISS strains showed aerobic, motile, rod shape, Gram
stain negative characteristics; colonies were pale yellow
in color, formed within 24–36 h at 35 °C on R2A, TSA,
and blood agar. Growth was observed at 1–8% NaCl and
in pH range 5–7. The Vitek and BioLog systems as well
as MALDI-TOF profiles identified the ISS strains as E.
ludwigii. The MALDI-TOF profile scores for the tested
strains were 2.16 (E. ludwigii) and 2.10 (E. asburiae). In
general,
no

differences

 observed among the Enterobacter species tested including
E. bugandensis EB-247T, whose genome is closer to ISS
strains. As reported earlier, all these five ISS Enterobacter
isolates were resistant to cefazolin, cefoxitin, oxacillin, peni-
cillin and rifampin, while for ciprofloxacin and erythro-
mycin,
strains
were
either
resistant
or
intermediate
resistant. For gentamycin and tobramycin some strains
were resistant, some intermediate resistant, and some sus-
ceptible [9].
Molecular phylogeny
The 16S rRNA gene sequencing of all five isolates placed
them within the Enterobacter group and showed max-
imum similarity (99.6%) with E. bugandensis EB-247T, E.
cancerogenus LMG 2693, E. ludwigii EN-119, and E.
mori R18–2 (99 to 100%). Since 16S rRNA gene sequen-
cing analysis is insufficient to differentiate Enterobacter
species, polygenic and whole genome-based analyses
were further attempted. All ISS strains were phylogenet-
ically characterized by the gyrB locus (~ 1.9 kb) and
showed that the ISS isolates form a close group with E.
bugandensis EB-247T and 153_ECLO strains (> 99%)
while MBRL 1077 isolate was exhibiting 97% similarity
with high bootstrap value.
MLST analysis
The genomic contigs of the ISS isolates were searched
for gene sequences of dnaA, fusA, gyrB. leuS, pyrG, rplB,
and rpoB, which are standardized for the use of MLST
analysis and reported for E. cloacae species [29]. The
good congruence between the single-gene reconstruc-
tions and the concatenate reinforced the stability of the
genealogy were observed. The reconstruction was based
on the RAxML algorithm [37] and the resulting MLST
tree (Fig. 1) shows that the ISS isolates are phlylogeneti-
cally related to E. bugandensis clinical strains (EB-247,
strain 153_ECLO, and isolate MBRL 1077).

cally resolve the ISS isolates to species level and distin-

Fig. 1 Multiple-locus sequence types (MLST) analysis of ISS strains and related species of the Enterobacter. The obtained genomic contigs of the
ISS isolates (in bold) were searched for gene sequences of dnaA, fusA, gyrB, leuS, pyrG, rplB, and rpoB, which are standardized for the use in MLST
analysis and reported for E. cloacae species [29]. The retrieved sequences were compared with the sequence types deposited at the Enterobacter
MLST database, concatenated according to the MLST scheme. The reconstruction was based on the RAxML algorithm [4], and the bootstrap

 validate these results. The snpTree does not ignore any
nucleotide positions and is able to consider 100% of the
chromosomal genome. All the available WGS of the En-
terobacter genus reference genomes from GenBank were
used for SNP analysis with snpTree. Of the 22 total nu-
cleotide sequences; 58,121 positions were found in all
analyzed genomes and 3832 positions in the dataset
were used to confer the final tree (Fig. 2). The snpTree
analyses confirmed and gave a strong validation to the
MLST/gyrB data, confirming that all ISS isolates are E.
bugandensis but strain MBRL 1077 grouped differently
from the members of the E. bugandensis group.
SNP identification within ISS strains was carried
out using GATK HaplotypeCaller. Filtered SNP calls
and indels (after removal of false positives) are given
in the Additional file 1: Table S1. Post-filtration ana-
lyses showed that there were 9, 12, 15, 13, and 0
SNPs seen in IF2SWB1, IF2SWB5, IF2SWP2, IS2WP3
and IS3SWP2, respectively. Further 6, 0, 4, 6, and 0
indels were seen in IF2SWB1, IF2SWB5, IF2SWP2,
IS2WP3 and IS3SWP2, respectively (Additional file 1:
Table S1). A maximum of 15 SNPs was observed
among ISS isolates, probably being clonal in origin,
with a very recent common ancestor. However, it
should be noted that 4 strains were isolated from
location #2 (space toilet) and one strain from the ex-
ercise platform (ARED).
ANI values and digital DNA-DNA hybridization
The ANI values for the ISS strains were maximum
against E. bugandensis EB-247, 153_ECLO, and MBRL
1077 strains (> 95%) as were those of MLST analyses,
and the ANI values of rest of the Enterobacter genomes
tested were < 91% (Table 1). The digital DNA-DNA
hybridization (dDDH) results of the ISS strain showed
high similarity with E. bugandensis EB-247 (89.2%),
153_ECLO (89.4%), and MBRL 1077 (64%) strains
whereas dDDH value was < 44.6% to all the other avail-
able Enterobacter reference genomes (Table 1). Based on
various molecular analyses attempted during this study
all five ISS Enterobacter strains were phenotypically and
genotypically identified as E. bugandensis.
Functional characteristics
A detailed genome analysis of all five ISS strains and 3
clinical isolates were carried out to understand its gen-
etic makeup. A total of 4733 genes were classified as
carbohydrate metabolism (635 genes), amino acid and
derivatives (496 genes), protein metabolism (291 genes),
cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments (275

 genes), membrane transport (247 genes), and RNA me-
tabolism (239 genes) (Fig. 3). To test antimicrobial re-
sistance at genomic level, the ISS strains were further
compared with nosocomial isolates (1291 genomes) hav-
ing more than 95% ANI identity with the ISS strains,
which taxonomically identified them as same species.
Genomes of the clinical strains of E. bugandensis 247,
153_ECLO, and MBRL-1077, whose ANI values were >
95%, were used for the genetic comparison to further
broaden the picture.
Features playing a broad role and implemented by the
same domain such as Spectinomycin 9-O-adenylyltrans-
ferase and Streptomycin 3-O-adenylyltransferase (EC
2.7.7.47) were only present in E. bugandensis 247 due to
the probable lack of selective pressure that might have
been encountered by the ISS isolates (Table 2). The pre-
dicted arsenic resistance (arsenic resistance protein,
ArsH) noticed in E. bugandensis 247 but not in other
strains should be phenotypically tested to confirm the
resistance properties conferred in strain E. bugandensis
247 and cross checked with the ISS strains for their in-
ability to degrade arsenic. Trace metals detected in ISS
potable water samples, but typically below potability re-
quirements, included arsenic, barium, chromium, cop-
per,
iron,
manganese,
molybdenum,
nickel,
lead,
selenium, and zinc. No mercury or cadmium was de-
tected and the arsenic levels varied from nondetectable
in water samples to a maximum of 3.8 μg/L [38].
Global comparison of ISS genomes with other
Enterobacter genomes
A visualization program was reported to be invaluable
[36] in determining the genotypic differences between
closely related prokaryotes. Visualizing a prokaryote
genome as a circular image has become a powerful
means of displaying informative comparisons of one
genome to a number of others. Using BRIG, a global
visual comparison of ISS isolates with other Enterobacter
WGS from the GenBank Microbial Genomes Resource
was carried out. The resulting output of the BRIG
analysis [36], a visualization image, showed draft genome
assembly information, read coverage, assembly break-
points, and collapsed repeats. The mapping of unassem-
bled sequencing reads of the ISS genomes against fully
annotated E. cloacae central reference sequences is
depicted in Fig. 4.
Discussion
In summary, a comparative phenotypic and genotypic
analyses of ISS isolates identified as E. bugandensis were
carried out. Additional genomic analyses revealed a close
genetic relatedness between ISS isolates and nosocomial
earth isolates. MLST and whole genome SNP tree placed
ISS and nosocomial isolates to a separate clade when
phylogenetically aligned with other member of genus
Enterobacter. A detailed functional and antimicrobial re-
sistance analysis reveals that the ISS isolates have a 79%
probability of being a human pathogen and share similar
antimicrobial resistance pattern with E. bugandensis
EB-247, MBRL-1077 and 153_ECLO strains, making
them relevant for future missions and crew health
considerations.
A total of 112 identified genes of the ISS strains were
involved in virulence, disease, and defense. Genes associ-
ated with resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds,
including the multidrug resistance tripartite system (also
known as 3-protein systems) as shown in a polychlori-
nated
biphenyl-degrader,
Burkholderia
xenovorans
LB400 [39], was noticed in the ISS strain. This protein
forms the basic structure and plays a crucial role in, the
functioning of an efflux pump rendering a microbe drug
resistant [40, 41]. A multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR)
locus or MAR operon was observed in ISS strains, which
codes for protein MarA, MarB, MarC, and MarR, and
regulate more than 60 genes, including upregulation of
drug
efflux
systems
that
have
been
reported
in
Escherichia
coli
K12
[42–44].
Aminoglycoside
adenylyltransferases,
whose
role
is
spectinomycin
9-O-adenylyltransferases, which confers microbial resist-
ance to the aminoglycosides in Salmonella enterica, was
also seen in ISS strains [45]. Similarly, resistance to
fluoroquinolones due to a mutation in gyrA gene in S.

 enterica [46], and fosfomycin resistance due to the pres-
ence of FosA protein-coding gene, which catalyzes the
addition of glutathione to C1 of the oxirane in Serratia
marcescens [47], were observed in ISS strains. Multiple
copies of multi-drug resistance (MDR) genes highly
homologous to S. marcescens, a pathogen, were iden-
tified in the ISS Enterobacter genomes, which gives
an indication that these strains may be a potential
human pathogen. When tested with PathogenFinder
[48] algorithm, strain IF2SW-P2T had > 77% probabil-
ity to be a human pathogen. When compared with E.
cloacae
ATCC
13047,
which
is
a
well-described
human pathogen [49], all five ISS strains showed a >
79% probability score.
Astronauts have been taking beta-lactam based med-
ical drugs for approximately two decades, and ß-lacta-
mase (superfamily I [metal dependent hydrolases] and
E.C.3.5.2.6) was present in all strains under study, while
penicillin-binding proteins (PPB4B) were only present in
MBRL-1077. Fluoroquinolone resistance due to gyrase
and topoisomerase mutation was present in all the
strains. Metal-dependent hydrolases, cation efflux sys-
tem protein CusA, cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance pro-
tein,
cobalt-zinc-cadmium

 detoxification of periplasm by exporting toxic metal
cation outside the cell. Determinants of the metal resist-
ance are usually located on the plasmid and readily
acquired from the environment and also complement
antibiotic resistance [50, 51]. The plasmid encoded puta-
tive transcriptional regulators containing the CopG/Arc/
MetJ DNA-binding domain and a metal-binding domain
were present in the ISS strains (Additional file 2: Table
S2).
Further
studies
are
required
for
phenotypic
characterization to confirm this trait. Presence of active
beta lactamase gene, efflux pump, and RND (resistance,
nodulation and cell division protein family) protein
family renders broad-spectrum resistance to ISS isolates
from drugs and natural inhibitors.
We
have
recently
observed
that
competency
of
bacteria to acquire foreign genetic material increases in
microgravity (in preparation) and similar mechanism for
metal resistance of ISS strain was also predicted. Anti-
microbial and metal resistance is also conferred by RND
genes [52], which were present in all the strains under
study. Genomic analysis reveals the presence of genes
associated with MDR efflux pump, belonging to RND,
which are reported to be the major contributors of
resistance to antibiotic and other toxic compounds to
the bacteria [41]. RND efflux system, inner membrane
transporter CmeB, membrane fusion protein CmeA,
outer membrane lipoprotein CmeC, outer membrane
lipoprotein NodT family were found in all strains. These
become important for the future space studies, as MDR
has been reported to play role in the physiological func-
tion and confer resistance to the substances like bile,
hormone and host defense molecule [53], which can
make bacteria a dominant persistor and lead to patho-
genicity in humans.
Conclusion
The genomic characterizations showed that the ISS En-
terobacter strains might potentially exhibit pathogenicity
to human. However, the pathogenicity of the ISS strains
compared to clinical strains isolated from patients
should be explored in vivo experiments before making
any assumption about whether these potential AMR
gene markers are due to spaceflight changes or not.
Moreover, the transit time and route for the organisms
from the ISS may have some small impact on the re-
sponse or physiological traits of the bacteria. WGS is
still an important tool to monitor transmission routes of
opportunistic pathogen bacteria [25, 26]. To avoid this,
future missions could utilize Nanopore sequencing dir-
ectly in microgravity as well as additional function and
taxonomic classification methods [26, 54], and then le-
verage the above detailed analytic steps to gauge rele-
vance for crew health and safety.
