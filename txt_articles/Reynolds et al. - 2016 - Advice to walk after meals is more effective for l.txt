Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Regular physical activity is a cornerstone of
diabetes management. We conducted a study to evaluate
whether specifying the timing of walking in relation to meals
enhances the benefits conferred by current physical activity
guidelines.
Methods A total of 41 adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus
(mean ± SD age 60 ± 9.9 years; mean diabetes duration
10 years) participated in this randomised, crossover study.
Randomisation was by a computer-generated protocol. For
periods of 2 weeks, advice to walk 30 min each day was
compared with advice to walk for 10 min after each main
meal. Both sets of advice met current physical activity
guidelines for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Physical
activity was measured by accelerometry over the full
intervention, and glycaemia was measured using continuous
glucose monitoring in 5 min intervals over 7 days. The
primary outcome of postprandial glycaemia was assessed
during the 3 h after a meal by the incremental area under the
blood glucose curve (iAUC).
Results The iAUC was significantly lower when participants
walked after meals compared with on a single daily occasion
(ratio of geometric means 0.88, 95% CI 0.78, 0.99). The
improvement was particularly striking after the evening meal
(0.78, 95% CI 0.67, 0.91) when the most carbohydrate was
consumed and sedentary behaviours were highest. One
participant died during the 30 day washout period between
interventions, but participation in this study was not judged
to contribute to this unfortunate event.
Conclusions/interpretation The benefits relating to physical
activity following meals suggest that current guidelines
should be amended to specify post-meal activity, particularly
when meals contain a substantial amount of carbohydrate.

Introduction
Physical activity guidelines are a cornerstone of advice to
prevent and manage type 2 diabetes mellitus [1]. Physical
activity has been shown to lower blood glucose levels [2, 3],
reduce cardiovascular risk by favourably influencing several
metabolic risk factors [4, 5] and help reduce body fatness in
the many people with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are over-
weight or obese [6, 7]. Current physical activity guidelines for

 people with type 2 diabetes mellitus promote at least 150 min
activity per week [8]. Walking or physical activity of similar
intensity is advised as it is effective [9, 10], but not associated
with an increased cardiovascular risk due to physical exertion
in people with established disease [11, 12].
Current guidelines include the option of several blocks of
activity during the day in order to aid compliance, but do not
specify when physical activity should be taken over the course
of the day. Postprandial glycaemia contributes considerably to
the overall hyperglycaemia of type 2 diabetes mellitus [13, 14]
and is an independent determinant of cardiovascular risk [15,
16]. Studies of a single meal or over a single day suggest that
post-meal physical activity can reduce blood glucose levels
[17–20]. The current study is the first controlled study in
free-living adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus that has aimed
to determine whether prescribed walking taken for short
periods after meals confers longer-term benefits than walking
on a single occasion at any time of the day.
Methods
Trial design This post-meal walking crossover study involved
two interventions in a randomised order, separated by a 30 day
washout (Fig. 1). It was conducted between September 2013
and February 2015 at the research clinic of the Department of
Human Nutrition, University of Otago, Dunedin, New
Zealand. Within each 2 week intervention, participants
attended the research clinic on days 1, 7 and 14. On day 1, a
fasting blood sample was drawn, measures of anthropometry
were taken, the physical activity regimen was prescribed and
accelerometers were fitted. On day 7, a continuous glucose-
monitoring system (CGMS) was fitted to participant’s abdomen,
a portable glucometer and testing supplies were provided, and a
semi-quantitative 7 day food diary was commenced. On day 14,
a fasting blood sample was drawn, measures of anthropometry
were taken, the CGMS was removed and the accelerometer and
food diary were returned. The same set of procedures was
followed during both interventions. The Health and Disability
Ethics Committee of the University of Otago approved this study
(H13/039), and participants provided written consent before
commencing the study.
Participants and eligibility criteria Participants with type 2
diabetes mellitus, and aged 18–75 years, were recruited through
general practices, hospital outpatient clinics, the local diabetes
society and services that cater for people with chronic diseases.
Pregnancy, lactation, and inability or unwillingness to comply
with the required physical activity excluded participation. The
presence of comorbidities did not exclude participation. A
consultant endocrinologist monitored participants for the study
duration, but this did not preclude participants visiting their
usual healthcare provider, if required.
Randomisation and masking A computer-generated
randomisation protocol, undertaken at a separate site,
determined the intervention order before the study began.
The protocol was undertaken on the advice of a biostatistician
(SW), and accessed only after participants were enrolled into
the study by the lead author (ANR). The interventions were
unmasked.

 Interventions In order to comply with current physical
activity guidelines, both interventions required participants
to walk for 30 min each day. The ‘30 min intervention’
involved one walk undertaken at any time of the day. The
‘post-meal walking intervention’ asked participants to take a
10 min walk after each of the three main meals, starting within
5 min of completing the meal. Participants were advised not to
change their diet or lifestyle habits during the study period,
beyond complying with the prescribed walking regimen.
Measurements Anthropometric measurements were recorded
in duplicate and resting BP was measured three times. The
CGMS (iPro, Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) sampled interstitial
glucose every 5 min for 7 days. Each CGMS was calibrated with
four capillary glucose tests each day (Optium, Abbott Diabetes,
Alameda, CA, USA). Triaxial accelerometers (ActiGraph,
Pensacola, FL, USA) were worn during waking hours for the
full 14 days of both periods to record activity, including walking
and sedentary behaviours. Glucose, HbA1c, glycated albumin
and lipids were measured in the fasting blood samples.
The primary outcome was postprandial glycaemia, which
was assessed during the 3 h after a meal by the incremental
area under the blood glucose curve (iAUC). The iAUC was
calculated from meal commencement using the trapezoidal
rule, ignoring the area below baseline [21]. Mean glucose over
7 days, the average daily fasting value from 02:00 to 06:00
each morning and measures of glycaemic variability were also
recorded. The mean amplitude of glycaemic excursion [22],
continuous overall net glycaemic action [23] and glycaemic
range (peak minus nadir) were calculated [24], as these
measures reflect different aspects of glycaemic variability.
Meal and daily fasting responses were omitted from the
analysis when more than two consecutive data points were
missing within the postprandial or daily fasting exposures.
This occurred in 2.4% of the 1594 meals, and none of the
493 fasting occasions. Interventions were repeated where the
CGMS failed while in use.
A predefined range of accelerometer counts was used to
determine time spent walking and sedentary time [25]. Both
walking and sedentary time are presented as the mean number
of minutes within the 60 min after each meal. Vector
magnitude counts/min are provided as an overall measure of
daily activity. Total sedentary time is shown as the mean
percentage of accelerometer wear time. Dietary data were
analysed using food composition tables [26]. Fasting glucose,
lipids and HbA1c were analysed on a Cobas C-311 analyser
with assay kits (Roche Diagnostics, Risch-Rotkreuz,
Switzerland). Glycated albumin was also measured with an
assay kit (Asahi Kasei, Tokyo, Japan); the coefficient of
variation was 1.3%.
Statistical analysis We based an estimate of the sample size
on a power calculation with an alpha of 0.05 and power of
0.80 to detect within-group differences in outcome variables: a
clinically relevant 20% difference in postprandial glycaemia
(iAUC) and a 10% difference in glycated albumin. We needed
28 participants to complete both interventions; however, we
over-recruited, with 42 participants enrolling in the study.
Data were analysed according to intention to treat. A mixed
model, which included a term for order, was used to analyse
the data. The results are presented as differences (with 95%
CIs) between the two interventions. The data for iAUC,
fasting plasma glucose and triacylglycerols were log
transformed before analysis. Differences in the primary
outcome (iAUC) are presented as ratios of the geometric
means. Analyses were undertaken using Stata version 13
(StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA), with the statistician
blinded to the primary analysis. All results are shown as
means±SD, unless otherwise stated.
Results
The flow of participants through the study is shown in Fig. 1.
Of the 42 eligible participants randomised, 41 (98%) completed
both intervention periods, exceeding the minimum number
required by the power estimate. The participant who did not
complete the study died during the 30 day washout period. The
mean age of participants was 60±9.9 years. Participants were
predominately male (n = 26, 63%). Mean HbA1c was 7.5
±1.42% (59±15.5 mmol/mol) and the mean diabetes duration
was 10±6.6 years. Most participants were of European descent
(n = 33, 80%), while the remainder were of Maori (New
Zealand’s indigenous people, n = 2), Pacific (n = 2), Asian
(n = 3), or Middle Eastern (n = 1) descent. The majority
(n=26, 63%) were on oral hypoglycaemic agents, while 27%
(n=11) were on insulin and metformin, and 10% (n=4) were
managed with diet alone. Only two participants (5%) currently
smoked. Before beginning the study the self-reported mean
walking time was 14 min/day [95% CI 9.4, 18.2 min/day], with
seven participants (17%) walking for 30 min or more each day.
Accelerometer wear time did not differ between interventions
(10 min [95% CI –30, 50 min] difference in wear time/day).
Table 1 shows the various measures of glycaemia associated
with the post-meal and standard 30 min walking regimens.
Overall postprandial glycaemia, as measured by the iAUC,
was 12% (95% CI 1%, 22%) lower during the post-meal
walking period than when following conventional physical
activity advice. This difference was largely explained by the
highly significant 22% (95% CI 9%, 33%) difference in iAUC
following the evening meal, when the greatest amount of
carbohydrate was consumed (Table 2) and when participants
tended to be more sedentary (Table 3). Mean blood glucose
levels during the 3 h following the evening meal were
significantly lower following post-meal walking (–0.50 mmol/l
2574
Diabetologia (2016) 59:2572–2578
 [95% CI –1.0, –0.04 mmol/l], p=0.034) compared with when
timing of walks was not specified.
Amount of carbohydrate consumed did not differ
significantly during the two intervention periods, although
carbohydrate as a percentage of total energy was slightly
greater during the 30 min walk regimen (1.8% [95% CI
0.4%, 3.1%], p=0.008; Table 2).
Further measures of activity and sedentary time are shown
in Table 3. Overall physical activity (counts/minute) was
greater during the post-meal walking intervention than when
the activity prescription involved a continuous 30 min walk at
any time of the day. Sedentary time was reduced following
each meal and walking duration increased after lunch and
dinner when post-meal walking rather than a 30 min walk/day
was prescribed. Anthropometric, BP and lipid measures
before and after each physical activity regimen are shown in
Table 4. No significant differences were observed.
Adverse events One participant died during the 30 day
washout period of the study. Physical activity was not being
undertaken at the time of death. The requirements of this study
are not perceived to have contributed to this unfortunate event.
Discussion
In this study involving patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a
prescription to walk daily after meals was associated with
improvements in postprandial glycaemia when compared with
advice to walk for 30 min/day in a single bout at an
unspecified time. Both interventions were consistent with
current physical activity guidelines and differed only with
regard to the specified time of walking. Although the
prescriptions were matched in total walking time, the advice
to walk after each main meal resulted in significantly greater

 overall activity. The improvement in overall postprandial
glycaemia was largely accounted for by lower blood glucose
levels after the evening meal, when carbohydrate consumption
was high and participants tended to be more sedentary.
Accelerometry confirmed that, on average, participants walked
for the prescribed duration after meals.
The study was sufficiently powered to generate reliable
results and all but one participant completed the study. The
CGMS provided an objective, unbiased and sensitive primary
endpoint, while accelerometry provided a reliable measure of
physical activity. The prescribed level of activity was modest,
so the results may be regarded applicable to a wide group of
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are sufficiently
motivated to undertake physical activity. A limitation of the
study is that the interventions were of insufficient duration to
confirm that the improvement in postprandial glycaemia
translated into an improvement in overall glycaemic control.
Nevertheless, postprandial glycaemia is an important
determinant of glycaemic control in its own right [13, 14]. It
would be useful in future studies to include biochemical or
cell-based measurements that might help to explain the
mechanisms by which increased walking after meals can
reduce blood glucose levels [1].
Our study is the first controlled study in patients with type 2
diabetes mellitus to examine the effects of post-meal activity
on postprandial glycaemia in free-living individuals, and the
first to have continued over a period longer than 2 days.
Several previous studies have shown reduced postprandial
glycaemia when a meal has been followed by physical activity
compared with remaining sedentary [17–20, 27–30]. These
studies have typically included eight to 12 participants
observed in a controlled setting with meals provided.
Previous studies have varied in the frequency at which blood
glucose was measured, although this has usually been at

 30 min intervals following a single meal. Studies have also
examined the effect of individual meals, whereas using a
CGMS enabled us to measure glucose at 5 min intervals over
a 7 day period. Furthermore, additional previous studies have
examined the effects of physical activity, but not specified the
timing of activity in relation to meals [31, 32].
Reduction of postprandial glucose is regarded as an
important target in the management of type 2 diabetes
mellitus, given its independent contribution to glycaemic
control and cardiovascular risk [13, 15, 16]. Postprandial
physical activity may avoid the need for an increased total
insulin dose or additional mealtime insulin injections that
might otherwise have been prescribed to lower glucose levels
after eating. An increase in insulin dose might, in turn, be
associated with weight gain in patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus, many of whom are already overweight or obese. Our
findings provide evidence for the amendment of guidelines to
specifically include post-meal activity, especially after meals
containing a substantial amount of carbohydrate.
In conclusion, while the existing data are arguably
sufficient to recommend at least 10 min of walking after
meals, additional research would enable this advice to be
further refined. Many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
may not be able or willing to undertake physical activity of
greater intensity. However, it would be helpful to know
whether a longer walk would produce a greater benefit when
undertaken after the meal providing the highest amount of
carbohydrate each day. A study of longer duration would
demonstrate if the reduction in postprandial blood glucose
levels translates into an overall improvement in glycaemic
control. Perhaps most important of all would be research
aimed at identifying means of achieving adherence with
advice to increase physical activity.
