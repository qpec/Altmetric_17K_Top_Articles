Summary
Background—Global HIV programs continue to experience challenges achieving the high rates 
of HIV testing and treatment needed to optimize health and reduce transmission. Botswana 
represents a useful “demonstration case” in assessing the feasibility of achieving the new UNAIDS 
targets for 2020: 90% of all persons living with HIV knowing their status, 90% of these 
individuals receiving sustained antiretroviral treatment (ART), and 90% of those on ART having 
virologic suppression (“90–90–90”).
Methods—A population-based random sample of individuals was recruited and interviewed in 
30 rural and peri-urban communities from October 2013 to November 2015 in Botswana as part of 
a large, ongoing PEPFAR-funded community-randomized trial designed to evaluate the impact of 
a combination prevention package on HIV incidence. A random sample of approximately 20% of 
households in each of these 30 communities was selected. Consenting household residents aged 
16–64 years who were Botswana citizens or spouses of citizens responded to a questionnaire and 
had blood drawn for HIV testing in absence of documentation of positive HIV status. HIV-1 RNA 
testing was performed in all HIV-infected participants, regardless of treatment status.
Findings—Eighty-one percent of enumerated eligible household members took part in the survey 
(10% refused and 9% were absent). Among 12,610 participants surveyed, 3,596 (29%) were HIV 
infected; 2,995 (83·3%) of these individuals already knew their HIV status. Among those who 
knew their HIV status, 2,617 (87·4%) were currently receiving ART (this represented 95% of 
those eligible for ART by current Botswana national guidelines, and 73% of all HIV-infected 
persons). We obtained an HIV-1 RNA result in 99·7% of HIV-infected participants. Of the 2,609 
individuals currently receiving ART with a viral load measurement, 2,517 (96·5%) had HIV-1 
RNA ≤400 copies/mL. Overall, 70·2% of HIV-infected persons had virologic suppression, close to 
the UNAIDS target of 73%. Results of three sensitivity analyses to account for possible 
uncertainty due to non-participation and under-representation of urban areas, revealed somewhat 
lower, but nevertheless remarkably high 90–90–90 coverage.
Interpretation—Botswana, a resource-constrained setting with high HIV prevalence, appears to 
have achieved very high rates of HIV testing, treatment coverage, and virologic suppression for 
those on ART in this population-based survey, despite the Botswana ART initiation threshold of 
≤350 cells/mm3. These findings provide evidence that the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, while 
ambitious, are achievable even in resource-constrained settings with high HIV burden.
Funding—The United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) through 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Background
In 2014, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) proposed new 
targets directed at ending the AIDS epidemic, namely that, by 2020, 90% of all HIV-infected 
people will know their HIV status; 90% of those diagnosed with HIV infection will receive

 sustained combination antiretroviral therapy (ART); and 90% of all people receiving ART 
will have viral suppression.1 The rationale underpinning these targets is related both to the 
health benefit of ART to infected individuals,2,3 and to the potent effect of ART on reducing 
sexual4-6 and perinatal7,8 HIV transmission.
However, uncertainty remains as to whether these ambitious UNAIDS targets are achievable, 
particularly in high-HIV-burden, resource-constrained settings such as sub-Saharan Africa. 
According to UNAIDS, in sub-Saharan Africa in 2013, only 45% of HIV-infected adults 
knew their HIV status; however, 86% of diagnosed persons were on ART, and an estimated 
76% of persons on ART achieved virologic suppression.9 This translates to 29% of all HIV-
positive persons in sub-Saharan Africa having virologic suppression, compared with the 
overall UNAIDS target of 73%. Recent estimates of progress toward reaching this target 
range from 68% in Switzerland,10 62% in Australia,11 and 30% in the United States,12 down 
to 9% in Russia.13
Botswana is a middle-income country with a stable democracy, high HIV prevalence (25·2% 
of persons 15–49 years),14 and a mature public ART program that started in 2002. Per 
current Botswana guidelines, HIV-infected citizens receive free 3-drug ART from 
decentralized health clinics if they have a CD4 count ≤350 cells/mm3, a WHO stage III or 
IV illness (including recent tuberculosis diagnosis), a history of cancer, or are pregnant or 
breastfeeding (regardless of CD4 count). We have a unique opportunity to assess population-
level coverage of HIV testing, ART, and virologic suppression in the context of a large, 
ongoing cluster-randomized combination prevention study that is underway in 30 
communities across Botswana.
Methods
Overall BCPP study design and procedures
The Botswana Combination Prevention Project (BCPP), also known as the “Ya Tsie” study, 
is a pair-matched, cluster-randomized trial funded by PEPFAR that is designed to test 
whether a package of combination prevention interventions reduces population-level 
cumulative 3-year HIV incidence. Another primary objective of the study includes 
evaluation of population-level uptake of HIV testing and ART at baseline and over time; the 
baseline cross-sectional results are presented in this manuscript. The trial is being conducted 
in 30 communities in Botswana (15 pairs matched according to size, pre-existing health 
services, population age structure, and geographic location, including proximity to urban 
areas), with a total population of approximately 180,000 persons (Figure 1), representing 
nearly 10% of Botswana’s estimated population. Fifteen communities were randomized to a 
combination prevention arm, and 15 to a non-intervention arm. Interventions in the 
combination prevention arm include home-based and mobile HIV testing and counseling; 
point-of-care CD4 testing; linkage to care support; expanded ART (for CD4 351–500 
cells/mm3 or CD4 >500 with HIV-1 RNA≥10,000 copies/mL, in addition to local criteria); 
and enhanced male circumcision services. The protocol has been amended to offer universal 
treatment (regardless of disease stage) in the intervention communities, and the Botswana 
Ministry of Health (MoH) plans to provide universal ART in 2016 (a change that will also

 apply to non-intervention communities). ART and other services are provided at or above 
the evolving local standard of care, throughout the study.
Study population
Survey participants were recruited using a household-based probabilistic sampling strategy 
at the community level. Within each of the 30 communities, the sampling strategy began 
with identifying and geocoding every plot with a household-like structure using satellite 
imagery captured between 2012 and 2015 (Google Earth, Mountain View, California) 
overlaid with enumeration boundaries used in the 2011 Botswana Census.15 A simple 
random 20% sample was then selected from the list of geocoded plots. For each household 
on the selected plots, a household representative (aged 18 years or older) was asked to list 
each household member with their age, gender, time spent in the household and relationship 
to the household head. Based on this information, research staff identified potentially 
eligible household members and invited them to provide written consent to participate, 
complete a questionnaire and undergo HIV testing. Eligibility criteria included age 16–64 
years; spending on average at least three nights per month in the household; documentation 
of Botswana citizenship or marriage to a Botswana citizen; and ability to provide informed 
consent. Participants received a BWP20 (approximately USD$2) cellular telephone prepaid 
voucher as compensation for their time. Plots were visited up to three times to enumerate 
household members; up to three additional attempts were made to enroll each enumerated 
household member.
Data collection
The baseline household survey included questions about sociodemographics, health, and 
HIV risk behavior. Persons who self-reported a positive HIV status and who were able to 
provide corresponding documentation (e.g. written test result, ART prescription) were not 
re-tested for HIV. All other participants were offered counseling and rapid HIV testing 
according to the Botswana-government– approved algorithm including KHB (KHB, 
Shanghai Kehua Bio-Engineering Co Ltd, China) and Unigold (Trinity Biotech Plc, Ireland) 
parallel HIV rapid tests. Documentation of ART receipt was sought for all persons who 
reported that they were currently on ART (e.g. prescriptions; clinical notes indicating ART 
receipt; or pills). HIV-1 RNA was tested in all HIV-infected persons, regardless of ART 
status. HIV-1 RNA was performed using the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay on the 
automated m2000 system (Abbott Laboratories, Wiesbaden, Germany) (range 40–
10,000,000 copies/mL) in the Botswana–Harvard HIV Reference Laboratory, which 
participates in Virology Quality Assurance and is accredited to ISO 17025. Point-of-care 
CD4 count (Pima, Alere Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts) was obtained on HIV-positive 
persons who were not currently taking ART. CD4 count and HIV-1 RNA results were shared 
with participants. Research assistants participated in the point-of-care CD4 and HIV testing 
external quality assurance program and were assessed for competence using blinded testing.
HIV-infected participants not yet on ART were referred to their local clinic for prompt ART 
initiation if their CD4 count was ≤350 cells/mm3 or if pregnant. HIV-infected participants 
with a CD4 count >350 cells/mm3 were referred to their local clinic for evaluation for

 possible ART initiation, and for other services as needed, including evaluation for 
tuberculosis.
After completion of the baseline survey, community-wide HIV testing and counseling, 
linkage to care, expanded ART, and expanded male circumcision interventions are started in 
the combination prevention communities. All participants in the baseline survey will be re-
contacted annually for three years, for HIV testing (if previously negative) and for re-
interview, with ongoing interventions in the combination prevention arm during this period.
Ethics
The study protocol, informed consent, and other materials are approved by the Botswana 
Health Research Development Committee (IRB of the Botswana MoH) and the United 
States CDC IRB. All participants provided written informed consent. Participants aged 16–
18 years provided written assent (with parents/guardians providing written permission). The 
study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01965470).
Statistical analysis
We restricted the present analysis to data collected from the baseline household survey of all 
30 study communities, prior to the roll-out of any intervention activities.
The 90–90–90 targets were calculated as follows: 
We used modified Poisson generalized estimating equations to obtain prevalence ratios (PR), 
corresponding Huber robust standard errors and 95% Wald confidence intervals (CI) to 
examine associations between individual sociodemographic factors and a binary outcome 
indicating achievement of the three individual and combined overall 90–90–90 targets.16 All 
analyses were conducted using SAS software version 9·4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
We conducted three additional analyses to assess the extent to which our results might be 
sensitive to selection bias due to non-participation. First, complete-case inverse-probability

 weighting was used to re-estimate each 90–90–90 target, adjusting for non-participation by 
accounting for fully observed potential predictors common to non-participation and the 90–
90–90 targets.17,18 Inverse-probability weighting adjusts for non-participation by empirically 
breaking the association between observed predictors and non-participation, allowing for 
unbiased estimation in the weighted sample provided a regression for non-participation is 
correctly specified, and no unobserved correlates of non-participation and outcomes defining 
the 90–90–90 targets exist. Inverse-probability weights for participation were constructed 
using the predicted probabilities from a multivariable logistic regression model containing 
the following fully observed covariates and their two-way interactions: age, gender, 
relationship to household head, community, and presence of household member during 
enumeration. We then conducted a weighted, complete-case crude analysis using modified 
Poisson generalized estimating equations to estimate the marginal probability of each 90–
90–90 target.
Although inverse-probability weighting adjusts for observed differences between enrolled 
and unenrolled enumerated persons found to be eligible, the enumerated population itself 
may systematically differ from the general population. Therefore, in a second sensitivity 
analysis, we standardized our observed 90–90–90 estimates to the age and gender 
distribution of HIV-positive persons in Botswana using the 2011 Botswana Census15 and the 
2013 Botswana AIDS Indicator Survey.19
Finally, we performed a third sensitivity analysis which entailed re-estimating the 90–90–90 
targets by combining complete-case outcomes observed among enrolled participants with 
potential outcomes of un-enrolled, eligible household members, assuming a hypothetical 
scenario in which non-participating residents had substantially lower rates of HIV testing, 
ART coverage, and virologic suppression. Programming code is available upon request by

Results
The baseline household survey was conducted in 30 communities from October 2013-
November 2015. Research staff visited 13,135 randomly-selected plots identified on satellite 
imagery and categorized 9,940 (76%) as residential and habitable. On these plots, 11,582 
households were identified, 10,306 (89%) were found to be regularly occupied, and 7,696 
(75%) were enumerated (Figure 2). Reasons for non-enumeration included absence of an 
eligible household informant (10%), absence of any persons (7%), and refusal (6%). A total 
of 28,174 residents were enumerated; 15,475 (55%) were eligible for participation and of 
these, 12,610 (81%) completed the baseline survey. Among the 15,475 enumerated, eligible 
household members, 9,286 (60%) were women and 6,189 (40%) were men. Reasons for 
non-participation among eligible persons included refusal (10%) and absence (9%).

 Of the 12,610 participants, 2,995 (24%) had documentation of prior positive HIV test, 9,575 
(76%) underwent HIV testing, and 40 (0·3%) refused testing. Overall, 3,596 participants 
(including individuals known to be HIV-infected and those newly testing positive for HIV) 
were HIV infected for an overall HIV prevalence of 29%. HIV-1 RNA testing was 
completed in 99·7% of HIV-infected participants.
Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics of HIV-infected enrollees. Seventy-three 
percent were female (median age 40 years, IQR 33–48 years). Eighty-seven percent (8,050 
of 9,268) of women residing in participating households enrolled, compared to 74% (4,560 
of 6,189) of men residing in these households. The majority of participants reported being 
single and nearly one-half had a primary school education or less. Approximately one-third 
were employed and 56% reported no monthly income. More than two-thirds of participants 
spent <1 week outside the community during the previous 12 months.
Coverage of 90–90–90 targets
Among the 3,596 HIV-infected persons identified, 2,995 (83·3%; 95% CI: 81·4%, 85·2%) 
already knew their positive status and provided supporting documentation. A total of 466 
participants newly tested HIV-positive and 135 self-reported being HIV-positive but could 
not provide documentation. Although these individuals were retested and found to be 
positive, to be conservative, they were not included in the numerator of the first 90–90–90 
target.
Among the 2,995 HIV-infected persons who knew their positive status, 2,617 (87·4%; 95% 
CI: 85·8%, 89·0%) were receiving ART; an additional 26 participants reported taking ART 
previously, but were not currently on ART. The 2,617 participants currently receiving ART 
represented 95% of the 2,754 persons eligible for ART per Botswana guidelines.
Finally, 2,517 (96·5%; 95% CI: 96·0%, 97·0%) of the 2,609 participants currently on ART 
with a viral load measurement had HIV-1 RNA ≤400 copies/mL; 2,428 (93·1%; 95% CI: 
92·1%, 94·0%) had HIV-1 RNA ≤40 copies/mL. Among the 2,635 persons who reported 
ever starting ART for their health (including defaulters) with a viral load measurement, 
95·6% (95% CI: 95·0%, 96·3%) had HIV-1 RNA ≤400 copies/mL.
Overall, among all HIV-infected persons, 83·3% (95% CI: 81·4%, 85·2%) knew their status, 
72·8% (95% CI: 70·1%, 75·5%) were currently receiving ART, and 70·2% (95% CI: 67·5%, 
73·0%) were currently on ART and had virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA ≤400 copies/mL) 
(Figure 3). Interestingly, 136 participants reported that they were not currently receiving 
ART but had an HIV-1 RNA ≤400 copies/mL. To confirm the ART status, we queried the 
Botswana MoH electronic medical records systems for evidence of recent receipt of ART 
services. We were able to retrieve records for 96 (71%) of these individuals and 40 (42%) 
were found to have initiated ART prior to the survey. If we include these 40 additional 
participants with HIV-1 RNA ≤400 copies/mL, the coverage estimates for diagnosis, 
treatment and virologic suppression would increase to 83·3%, 88·7% and 96·5%, 
respectively (and 71·3% would have achieved the overall 90–90–90 target).

 Sensitivity analyses
Table 2 presents the results of three sensitivity analyses undertaken to examine the potential 
impact of selection bias due to either non-participation among enumerated eligible residents 
and/or differences between our enumerated sample and Botswana’s general population. 
Adjustment by inverse probability weighting and standardization resulted in an overall target 
estimate of 69·8% (95% CI: 67·1%, 72·6%) and 63·4% (95% CI: 61·6%, 65·1%), 
respectively (Table 2). Finally, when we assumed that HIV prevalence was 50% higher and 
knowledge of HIV status, ART coverage and virologic suppression were each 25% lower in 
non-participants than what was observed among enrolled participants, the overall target 
estimate was 63·8%.
Predictors of achieving 90–90–90 targets
Table 3 presents the univariable associations between baseline characteristics and 
achievement of each individual and overall 90–90–90 target. Male gender, younger age, 
being single or never married, increased time spent outside the community, and higher levels 
of education were significantly associated with lower levels of coverage for the overall 
target. For example, HIV-infected participants aged <30 years were nearly one-half as likely 
to know their status, be on ART and achieve viral suppression compared to those aged ≥60 
years. Similarly, spending >12 weeks outside the community and having higher than senior 
secondary education were each associated with an approximate 20% decreased likelihood of 
meeting the overall target (Table 3).
Discussion
We found very high levels of diagnosis, treatment and viral suppression among HIV-infected 
individuals in our study population: 83·3% of HIV-infected persons knew their positive 
status, 87·4% of these individuals were receiving ART, and 96·5% of persons receiving ART 
had virologic suppression. Overall, 70·2% of all HIV-infected persons had virologic 
suppression, compared with the UNAIDS goal of 73%. Younger age was the strongest 
predictor of being undiagnosed, not on ART and not virologically suppressed in our 
population, followed by more time spent outside the community (>12 weeks/year). Women 
were more likely to know their positive HIV status than men, potentially due to near 
universal testing of pregnant women in Botswana.20
Very few countries, including those in North America and Europe, have achieved similarly 
high coverage levels. In recent national-level analysis of HIV treatment cascades by Levi et 
al, no country met the overall UNAIDS goal of 73% virologic suppression among persons 
living with HIV.21 It may be informative for countries and programs to evaluate their success 
in reaching the 90–90–90 targets, even if they have not yet moved to universal testing and 
treatment.
Several factors likely contribute to Botswana's successful HIV treatment program. Botswana 
was among the first high-HIV-burden countries to make prevention of mother-to-child 
transmission services (starting in 2000) and ART (starting in 2002 with expansion 
nationwide by 2006) available to citizens for free. There has been a strong political will to

 speak openly about HIV in public forums and destigmatize HIV testing. In 2004, former 
Botswana President Festus Mogae introduced routine “opt-out” HIV testing and counseling 
in healthcare settings. According to UNAIDS, the lack of widely available testing may 
constitute the major impediment to achieving high ART coverage, particularly in sub-
Saharan Africa.1 With a widely dispersed population, Botswana prioritized early 
decentralization of HIV treatment: ART is available from more than 600 clinics nationwide 
alongside other health services. Distance to services is correlated with retention in care22 
and an estimated 95% of the Botswana population resides within 10km of an ART-
dispensing facility. Furthermore, the program has included virologic monitoring for patients 
on ART since inception, enabling adherence assessment and interventions. Many of these 
approaches could be adopted by other countries/programs.
High rates of treatment coverage and virologic suppression should help reduce HIV 
incidence. However, the most recent estimate of annual adjusted HIV incidence in Botswana 
(1·35% in 2013) indicates substantial ongoing transmission.19 This is presumably due to 
ongoing transmission from the 30% of HIV-infected persons who remain untreated in this 
setting of high HIV prevalence; furthermore, these data (and the 90–90–90 targets) do not 
capture the complexities of sexual networks, risk behavior patterns, and biologic factors that 
also contribute to ongoing HIV transmission. Nevertheless, in totality, evidence from this 
and other studies suggests that universal ART (regardless of CD4 count), as recently 
recommended by the World Health Organization,23 will be important in decreasing new 
infections.
The main strength of this analysis is that it draws upon a large population-based random 
sample of household residents from 30 geographically and ethnically diverse communities 
across Botswana. Routinely collected programmatic data cannot provide the actual number 
of persons living with HIV. Rather, this figure is usually estimated indirectly from 
population distributions and HIV prevalence figures. Similarly, programmatic data generally 
cannot directly estimate the numbers of HIV-infected individuals who have been diagnosed 
with HIV. We were able to collect data on both of these indicators, and to test for virologic 
suppression in >99% of HIV-infected participants; viral load information is infrequently 
available in resource-constrained settings.
Our study is subject to several limitations. First, approximately 25% of potentially inhabited 
households were not enumerated, and nearly 20% of age- and residency-eligible members of 
enumerated households were not enrolled. Botswana has a highly mobile population, and the 
most common reasons for non-participation were absenteeism and refusal. It is possible that 
persons not found in the household may differ from enrolled participants with respect to 
diagnosis, treatment and virologic suppression as defined by the 90–90–90 targets. For 
example, nearly three quarters of our participants were female compared to 60% of 
household residents. A weighted sensitivity analysis accounting for differences between 
enumerated, unenrolled eligible household members and enrolled participants did not 
substantially change our findings. Additionally, our estimates were derived from smaller 
rural/peri-urban communities. It is not possible to know whether individuals residing in 
other areas (including urban settings) would have similar HIV testing, treatment and 
adherence rates. However, given earlier and more widespread availability of HIV testing and

 treatment facilities, we anticipate coverage to be higher in urban areas. Furthermore, 
according to Botswana national treatment and UNAIDS14 statistics, approximately 270,000 
(~70%) of people believed to be living with HIV in Botswana are on ART, which is similar 
to the 72·8% estimate in our study population. According to the 2013 Botswana AIDS 
Indicator Survey, the estimated HIV prevalence was slightly lower in rural/peri-urban 
villages such as those taking part in BCPP (17·4%-18·7%) compared with prevalence in 
cities or towns (19·5%-21·6%); HIV prevalence varies more dramatically by region 
(11·1%-27·5%).19 A sensitivity analysis that standardized estimates of 90–90–90 targets to 
Botswana’s national HIV-infected population did not substantially alter our findings. The 
overall target estimate after standardization was 63·4% (95% CI: 61·6%, 65·1%), compared 
with our observed estimate of 70·2% (95% CI: 67·5%, 73·0%). Lastly, our eligibility criteria 
excluded several key populations, including adolescents and children less than 16 years old, 
adults 65 years and older, and non-citizens. Given our home-based recruitment approach 
(which may reach somewhat different populations compared with those reached by other 
HIV testing strategies),24 our study also did not attempt to enroll other key populations such 
as commercial sex workers. We estimate that approximately 2% of enumerated residents 
were not Botswana citizens. This may be important, because non-citizens are ineligible to 
receive ART free of charge in the country.
Despite these limitations, our data represent among the most complete, population-level 
estimates available from the region, and indicate very high rates of coverage related to HIV 
testing, ART initiation, and virologic suppression. It is particularly remarkable that 
Botswana has achieved such high rates of ART coverage and virologic suppression given 
that the national CD4 threshold for ART eligibility has been ≤350 cells/mm3; this could 
indicate a more “mature” epidemic, and may differ in other settings. We found that 95% of 
HIV-infected persons eligible for ART by current guidelines are already on ART. These 
findings suggest that Botswana should reach and exceed the UNAIDS 90–90–90 targets 
sooner than 2020, if treatment eligibility changes to include ART to all persons living with 
HIV irrespective of their CD4 count, assuming the health system is able to test and treat 
those not yet on ART, and that persons starting ART with higher CD4 count will exhibit 
reasonably high levels of adherence.
Although Botswana is a middle-income country with a total population of approximately 2 
million, it has suffered from a very significant burden of HIV disease. The high rates of HIV 
testing, ART, and virologic suppression in Botswana provide good evidence that the 
UNAIDS targets are achievable elsewhere.

 Research in context
Evidence before this study
In light of accumulating evidence that providing antiretroviral treatment to all people 
living with HIV (regardless of disease stage) optimizes their health and will help end the 
global HIV epidemic, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has 
proposed new HIV testing and treatment targets: that 90% of all people living with HIV 
will know their HIV status, 90% of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will be on 
antiretroviral treatment, and 90% of all people receiving treatment will have virologic 
suppression by 2020. However, considerable uncertainty remains as to whether these 
ambitious UNAIDS targets are achievable, especially in resource-constrained settings 
where the burden of HIV is the largest. The vast majority of publicly available figures (in 
PubMed, UNAIDS reports, and meetings proceedings) that describe global progress 
toward achieving these targets are derived indirectly using model-based estimates of the 
relevant numerators and denominators rather than directly measured data. Moreover, 
estimates of virologic suppression among HIV-positive persons receiving treatment are 
largely restricted to Western nations; only limited data on this key component of the HIV 
treatment cascade are available from high-HIV-burden, resource-constrained settings. 
(Databases searched: PubMed; UNAIDS, WHO, and US CDC websites; Google search 
engine (for conference proceedings); search terms used: “HIV testing coverage,” 
“antiretroviral treatment coverage,” “national antiretroviral treatment”; date of search: 22 
February 2016.)
Added value of this study
Botswana is a middle-income country in sub-Saharan Africa with a very high prevalence 
of HIV (25.2% among persons 15–49 years) and a national treatment program that offers 
antiretrovirals to HIV-infected adults with CD4 count of 350 cells/mm3 or below. We 
directly measured population-level coverage of HIV testing, antiretroviral treatment, and 
virologic suppression (the three UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets) in the context of a cluster-
randomized HIV combination prevention study that is underway in 30 communities 
across Botswana. A pre-intervention survey was administered to more than 12,000 adult 
residents recruited from a 20% simple random sample of all households in the 
communities. We found one of the highest overall coverage levels of the UNAIDS 
90-90-90 targets that has been described to date globally—a level that nearly achieves the 
overall UNAIDS target.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our findings provide current evidence that the UNAIDS targets, while ambitious, are 
achievable even in resource-constrained settings with high HIV burden.
