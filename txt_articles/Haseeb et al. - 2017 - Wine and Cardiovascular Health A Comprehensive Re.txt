ABSTRACT: Alcoholic beverages have been consumed for thousands 
of years, attracting great human interest for social, personal, and 
religious occasions. In addition, they have long been debated to confer 
cardioprotective benefits. The French Paradox is an observation of a low 
prevalence of ischemic heart disease, with high intakes of saturated fat, a 
phenomenon accredited to the consumption of red wine. Although many 
epidemiological investigations have supported this view, others have 
attributed it to beer or spirits, with many suggesting that the drink type 
is not important. Although excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages 
is commonly regarded to be detrimental to cardiovascular health, there 
is a debate as to whether light-to-moderate intake is cardioprotective. 
Although there is extensive epidemiological support for this drinking 
pattern, a consensus has not been reached. On the basis of published 
work, we describe the composition of wine and the effects of constituent 
polyphenols on chronic cardiovascular diseases.
A
lcoholic beverages have been consumed for thousands of years, predating 
biblical times and spanning as far back as early human emergence. Before 
there was wine, beer, or spirits, primates lived on a diet predominantly 
consisting of fruits and vegetables, with water serving as the main fluid for surviv-
al. Until proper methods of water delivery and decontamination were conceived, 
our ancestors relied on fresh water from streams, rivers, and precipitation, but 
fermented fruits including berries and even mead could have been regularly con-
sumed in the form of drinks. Following the Neolithic era ≈10 
000 BC, cultivation 
and maintenance of crops allowed for the production of the earliest forms of what 
we now consider wine and beer; however, alcohol was almost certainly consumed 
much earlier. Fruits, grains, and even honey were fermented to produce alcoholic 
beverages, and alcohol became a staple of consumption to our hunter-gatherer 
predecessors.1
There is no doubt that wine and alcohol have attracted great human interest 
for recreational and personal use.1 The culture of drinking has only grown since 
its initiation, and fermented products including fruits and grains have been used 
to produce alcoholic beverages. In addition, scientific intrigue has also grown ex-
tensively for alcohol since the 20th century, as epidemiological evidence amassing 
large prospective, cross-cultural studies emerged in support for the hypothesis of 
a negative correlation with moderate consumption of alcohol and ischemic heart 
disease (IHD).2 Such correlation has also been reported individually for red wine.3 
Although evidence of these cardiovascular benefits is inconsistent and heavily 
debated by physicians and scientists alike,4 epidemiological studies have strongly

supported this view being specific to wine,5 especially 
red wine. More specifically, some postulate that red 
wine’s bioactive constituents, polyphenols, impart car-
dioprotective effects.6 Others argue that there may be 
an equilibrium between alcohol and wine polyphenols, 
which in concert would be accountable for the cardio-
protective benefits in the human body.7
The French Paradox is a term derived from the observa-
tion of a decreased incidence of IHD despite a high intake 
of saturated fat.8 This is linked to France and led scientists 
to attribute this phenomenon to the high consumption of 
wine.8 The French Paradox started extensive research into 
wine and led to the identification of many compounds, 
namely polyphenols, that are thought to be the basis of 
wine’s apparent cardioprotective potential. Red wine, 
among other constituents, is also included in the Mediter-
ranean diet, and this diet has been labeled as beneficial by 
scientific advisory committees.9
Although excessive or binge drinking of alcoholic bev-
erages is regarded to be detrimental to cardiovascular 
and general health, light-to-moderate intake of regular 
amounts is recommended in the literature.10 Adverse ef-
fects of acute and chronic alcohol consumption are de-
pendent on the doses of intake; however, differing opin-
ions exist regarding red wine’s potential as a therapeutic 
agent, regardless of the pattern of drinking.11 From a pub-
lic health perspective, alcohol consumption is regarded as 
a risk factor for chronic diseases, and globally it contributes 
to an increase in disease burden.12 Although these detri-
mental risks are present and may outweigh the benefits 
of alcohol consumption, wine and alcohol will continue to 
be ever-present in our society.
With a popular drink like wine surrounded by such 
scientific intrigue, it is desirable to provide a compre-
hensive account, from a cardiovascular point of view, of 
its anatomy, mechanisms of actions, and risks and ben-
efits of consumption. Most reviews and meta-analyses 
to date have focused on the individual characteristics of 
wine, but a much more inclusive review of the literature 
on wine and its comparisons with other alcoholic bever-
ages is needed. This review aims to investigate wine and 
its cardioprotective potential, highlight the importance 
of individual components of wine and their interactions 
with the cardiovascular system at large, and present up-
to-date epidemiological and experimental evidence of 
wine’s impact on chronic cardiovascular diseases. We 
also address the debate around the light-to-moderate 
intake of consumption, variable definitions of drinking, 
and current recommendations for consumption.
DEFINITIONS OF CONSUMPTION
What Constitutes a Standard Drink?
Alcoholic intake, if not monitored, can contribute to 
various adverse conditions that affect day-to-day life.13 
Hence, governments and international institutions have 
defined a unit called a “standard drink.”14 Epidemio-
logical and experimental studies take advantage of this 
metric to quantify consumption and assess population 
risk. Therefore, a standard drink size has become an 
important, but often publicly misunderstood metric, 
for population-based studies assessing phenomena re-
lated to the intake of alcohol. Quite apparent from the 
literature is the definition of a standard drink, which 
varies across country borders and across the scientific 
literature.15
A standard drink, or a unit of alcohol in the United 
Kingdom, is a national concept that is expressed in 
amounts of pure ethanol.16 To the general public, it is 
presented in amounts of beer, wine, or spirits, because 
they are the most commonly consumed beverages.16 
The units of alcohol in a beverage can vary depending 
on the source, but most common ones include stan-
dard drink, grams, milliliters, ounces, and alcoholic con-
centration by volume.17
The guidelines from the World Health Organization 
(WHO) on standard drink assume 1 standard drink to 
be 10 g of pure ethanol, with recommendations of 
not exceeding 2 standard drinks per day, with at least 
2 nondrinking days during the week.18 This definition 
is not widely adopted across country borders and car-
ries great country-to-country variation. Kalinowski and 
Humphreys14 systematically gathered international 
guidelines on standard drink definitions. Their methods 
of analysis and most important findings are summa-
rized in Table 1. They identified 75 governments that 
did not adopt such a definition. Their analysis included 
37 countries that did adopt the WHO standard drink 
measure but cited large variability between countries, 
ranging from 8 to 20 g. The authors further reported 
the 10-g WHO guideline to be the modal definition be-
tween countries, with variations ranging from 10 g/d to 
56 g/d for low-risk alcohol consumption. The standard 
drink is defined in terms of pure ethanol. Red wine, 
beer, and spirits are all composed of some percent-
age of pure ethanol. The WHO guidelines present a 
guide on calculating the alcoholic content of a bever-
age.18 The method of calculation, variables, and values 
are presented in Table 2. The alcoholic content within 
a drink depends on 2 variables: size of beverage and 
percent strength of pure ethanol.18 These variables vary 
across countries, cultures, and even vendors, but this 
guideline presents the most common scenario as a tool 
for drinkers to calculate the amount of pure ethanol in 
a drink.
A quantitative measure of a standard drink is essen-
tial; however, given the mathematical nature, the gen-
eral public has difficulty comprehending it and would 
rather prefer a more qualitative, day-to-day metric to 
regulate their consumption. The WHO guidelines de-
fine a standard drink in terms of glasses of wine, beer,

liquor, and shots of spirits (Table 3). They claim that 
these amounts roughly equal 1 standard drink.
Light, Moderate, and Excessive 
Consumption
Voskoboinik and coauthors19 define light alcohol con-
sumption as <7 standard drinks (std) per week, moderate 
as 7–21 std/wk, and excessive as >21 std/wk. This trans-
lates to <1 std/d for light consumption, 1–3 std/d for mod-
erate, and >3 std/d for excessive consumption, where 1 
standard drink is defined as 12 g of pure ethanol.
IMPORTANCE OF WINE AS A 
BIOLOGICAL BEVERAGE
The molecular properties of wine and their interactions 
with the human body were extensively researched after 
a negative correlation for IHD was reported with alco-
hol consumption. Since then, researchers have focused 
on pinpointing how this beverage imparted cardiopro-
tection against chronic cardiovascular diseases. After 
fermentation, wine still possesses a mixture of com-
pounds known as polyphenols that, besides ethanol, 
have emerged as key players in explaining red wine’s 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective 
properties.20
Why Red Wine? The Hypothesis
St Leger and colleagues3 reported a negative correla-
tion between alcohol consumption and IHD deaths, 
and attributed this observation predominantly to wine. 
Renaud and de Lorgeril8 subsequently described what 
they called the French Paradox, referring to the indirect 
observation that the French population consumed red 
wine with their diet, which was mostly high in satu-
rated fat, so this correlation between wine and car-
diovascular mortality was attributed to the consump-
tion of red wine.21 Since then, numerous studies have 
come out in favor of wine and alcohol conferring car-
diovascular benefits, but with one important caveat: 
most of these investigations, although involving large 
sample sizes with cross-cultural and geographical com-
parisons, were epidemiological. Scientists have thus 
questioned these results, but intrigue still surrounds 
the community. Several explanations for the French 
Paradox have been postulated,21 with epidemiologists 
presenting strong correlations in favor of wine (both

white and red), with other scientific literature criticiz-
ing these observations.
Red Wine Composition
Wine is an alcoholic beverage of complex composition 
that is obtained through the fermentation of grape 
must, and thus the quality and variety of grapes used in 
the vinification process have an impact on the compo-
sition of wine.22 Red wine is composed of >500 com-
pounds, with the most important constituents being 
water, alcohol (ethanol), and polyphenols.23 They can 
be divided into 2 primary groups: the flavonoids and 
nonflavonoids. The general composition of wine can 
be viewed in Figure 1. Flavonoids have been known to 
provide taste and color to wine while being important 
for health, while resveratrol (nonflavonoid) is debated 
to contribute to the potential bioactive properties of 
wine. Polyphenols amount to only a fraction of wine’s 
total content, but are of particular interest in cardiol-
ogy for their potential biological and cardioprotective 
properties.
Red Wine Versus White Wine
Red wine is known to be 10-fold higher in polypheno-
lic content than white wine, and this variability arises 
because of red wine’s grape must fermentation.22 This 
is why white wine is given much less importance than 
red wine in the literature. In addition, apart from the 
varying sugar content, polyphenols are the only major 
component different between red and white wines. 
There are few studies directly comparing the effects 
of the 2 drinks; therefore, conclusive evidence regard-
ing the comparison of the 2 wines is poor. Because the 
polyphenolic ratio in red and white wines differs sig-
nificantly, white wines’ protective mechanisms may be 
different from red wines’. Bertelli24 postulates that rela-
tively unknown active compounds identified in white 
wines, namely tyrosols, caffeic acid, and shikimic acids, 
might explain the biological basis of white wine’s car-
dioprotective effects.
BIOACTIVE COMPONENTS OF RED 
WINE
Bioavailability of Polyphenols
The biological properties of polyphenols are only utiliz-
able if they are bioavailable, which is dictated primarily 
by their chemical structure. Most polyphenols cannot 
be absorbed in their native form and are chemically 
modified after ingestion. Post–wine consumption, poly-
phenols are structurally modified and metabolized fairly 
quickly; thus, a component of the biological activity 
from wine is derived from metabolized polyphenols.25 
The bioavailability of wine polyphenols is low; however, 
there is consistent evidence that bioavailable concen-
trations after acute and chronic consumption of wine 
are able to exert beneficial biological effects in vivo.24
Flavonoids
Flavonoids are plant-based antioxidants that are in-
cluded in the family of polyphenols. They are found 
primarily in vegetables, fruits, and beverages such as 
tea and wine.26 Flavonoids can be synthesized only by 
plants and have been investigated for their protective 
abilities against chronic cardiac diseases (Figure 2). In 
the previous few decades, flavonoids have received 
much attention after epidemiological investigations 
specifically discovered that dietary flavonoids were 
inversely associated with IHD mortality.27 Flavonoids 
from red wine have been credited to inhibit low-den-

sity lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation28 and prevent endo-
thelial dysfunction,29 which is postulated to increase 
atherosclerosis development.30 Hence, flavonoids have 
antiatherosclerotic properties that are particularly ap-
parent when wine is studied devoid of ethanol, as de-
alcoholized wine (see Dealcoholized Red Wine: Car-
dioprotection of Wine Polyphenols Beyond Ethanol). 
Of the flavonoids, quercetin is known to be a potent 
antioxidant because it has been shown to have a neg-
ative correlation with cardiovascular mortality.29 In a 
dietary investigation of >1000 participants, high quer-
cetin intakes were associated with lower IHD mortality 
(relative risk [RR], 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.63–0.99; P=0.02) and lung cancer incidence (RR, 
0.42; 95% CI, 0.25–0.72; P=0.001).31
Quercetin
Quercetin, a plant polyphenol from the flavonoid 
group, has amassed much scientific intrigue. It is an im-
portant dietary flavonoid that is prominent in red wine 
and the Mediterranean diet.32 Of the flavonoid group, 
it is the most abundant dietary flavonoid that has been 
investigated for its antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, 
acute platelet thrombogenesis, and protective capabili-
ties against IHDs.33

cal components of wine.

Quercetin is found as a conjugated derivative in plas-
ma, and those metabolites subsequently exert physio-
logical effects.34 Quercetin is known to be an effective 
free radical scavenger that prevents LDL oxidation in 
humans.35 It causes endothelium-dependent vasodila-
tion of vascular smooth muscles and inhibits platelet 
aggregation, which can subsequently contribute to ath-
erosclerosis.29 In apolipoprotein E gene–deficient mice, 
Loke and colleagues36 studied quercetin and other di-
etary flavonoids’ capabilities to reduce atherosclerotic 
lesions. This group demonstrated that quercetin at-
tenuated lesions by inhibiting inflammation, improv-
ing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, and inducing heme 
oxygenase-1, which all seemed to have been protec-
tive. In human subjects, however, contradictory results 
have come to light, showing that dietary quercetin did 
not change biomarkers of inflammation.37 To elucidate 
causation, further dose-response, randomized, and pla-
cebo-controlled studies are needed.
In dogs with experimental myocardial infarction, 
quercetin intervention led to an improvement in left 
ventricular contractile function.38 Similarly, quercetin 
has further been documented to protect the myocardial 
tissue against reperfusion injury and global ischemia.39
Resveratrol
Resveratrol is a nonflavonoid stilbene derivative pro-
duced by plants that is prominently present in red wine 
and grapes.40 Resveratrol from red wine is postulated 
to be an important contributor in explaining the French 
Paradox. The increased publicity of resveratrol’s bioac-
tive potential and treatment of chronic disorders such 
as cardiovascular diseases and cancer has engaged 
public interest in resveratrol supplements.41
A number of preclinical and clinical studies have 
demonstrated a very low oral bioavailability for resvera-
trol42; however, Goldberg and coworkers43 demonstrat-
ed that resveratrol and other polyphenols reached peak 
concentrations 30 minutes postprandial, with the ab-
sorption of transresveratrol being 20-fold more efficient 
than the flavonoid catechin.44 However, broadly speak-
ing for all polyphenols, the bioavailability is enough to 
exert antioxidant effects. A wealth of data has been 
collected on resveratrol and its effects on hypertension, 
atherosclerosis, stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart 
failure.45 In general, beneficial effects of the administra-
tion of resveratrol as a supplement have been reported 
for the aforementioned diseases and may be one of the 
reasons why this compound is being heavily advertised 
as a cardioprotective supplement.
PUTATIVE MECHANISMS OF ACTION
According to reports, the exact mechanisms of action 
that underlie cardioprotection for red wine have not yet 
been causally interpreted; however, in vitro, in vivo, and 
human epidemiological studies have shown cardiovas-
cular benefits of drinking red wine, and have postu-
lated interesting explanations for cardioprotection. A 
summary of the biological events and triggering chemi-
cals is presented in Figure 3.
Protective Mechanisms: Red Wine 
Polyphenols and Ethanol
Red wine polyphenols reduce platelet aggregation46 
and improve fibrinolysis.47 The endothelium controls 
NO release, which subsequently regulates vascular 
tone, relaxes vascular smooth muscle cells, and inhibits 
platelet aggregation.48 Moderate wine consumption in-
creases NO production,49 which induces vasodilation.29 
Endothelial dysfunction reduces NO bioavailability 
that is associated with cardiovascular diseases includ-
ing atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and hypertension.48 In 
regard to hypertension, alcohol consumption in mod-
eration is linked to a reduction in systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure.50
Polyphenols are strong antioxidants that improve 
the lipid profile by reducing the susceptibility of LDL 
to oxidation.28 Conversely, the intake of red wine in-
creases blood high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and 
triglycerides.51 A meta-analysis of 42 human studies52 
found that an experimental dose of 30 g ethanol/d in-
creases concentrations of HDL cholesterol (3.99 mg/dL; 
95% CI, 3.25–4.73), triglycerides (5.69 mg/dL; 95% CI, 
2.49–8.89), and apolipoprotein AI (8.82 mg/dL; 95% 
CI, 7.79–9.86), a main protein in HDL cholesterol. Case 
presentations have supported the hypothesis of HDL 
cholesterol and apolipoprotein AI deficiencies playing a 
significant role in an increased risk of atherosclerosis.53
Alcohol intake at regular intervals is observed to 
be beneficial for diabetes mellitus. Light-to-moderate 
consumption enhances insulin sensitivity by increasing 
insulin-mediated glucose uptake.54 Increased insulin 
sensitivity is proposed to be associated with greater 
HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein AI levels55 and pos-
sibly contributes to a decreased incidence of IHD.56
Pathophysiological Mechanisms: Alcohol 
and Atrial Fibrillation
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia 
encountered in clinical practice.57 Consumption of 
alcohol may trigger AF, and sustained consumption 
may cause atrial electric remodeling.19 Voskoboinik and 
coworkers19 reviewed alcohol’s effects on AF and con-
cluded that its consumption was a risk factor for AF, 
causing increased recurrence and higher rates of parox-
ysmal and persistent AF. They further commented that 
the cardioprotective benefits of alcohol on IHD do not 
apply to AF. In a UK cohort (N=703 777), moderate-to-

1440
high consumption of alcohol was identified as an in-
dependent risk factor for progression of paroxysmal AF 
to persistent AF (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.2–6.0).58 
In 115 patients with a recorded idiopathic AF episode, 
patients who experienced recurrence (n=32) had a sig-
nificantly higher incidence of consuming alcohol regu-
larly (P=0.014).59 Alcohol’s effects on cardiac conduc-
tion have also been investigated. In a pilot study of 14 
patients with a reported heart disease, acute excessive 
alcohol intake slowed intra-atrial conduction and short-
ened ventricular myocardial refractory periods.60 As for 
interatrial conduction, which is usually measured by the 
P-wave duration and has been found to be a predictor 
of AF;61 a study showed that average P-wave duration 
was significantly affected after alcohol intake in nor-
mal healthy subjects (107±9 versus 125±11; P<0.05).62 
However, the duration was more altered after alcohol 
consumption for patients with a documented history of 
paroxysmal AF than in control subjects (125±11 versus 
158±29; P<0.05).
THE FRENCH PARADOX AND BEYOND
Renaud and de Lorgeril8 first coined the term French 
Paradox in 1992, an observation of low IHD and associ-
ated mortality despite the high intake of saturated fat 
in southern France. The authors attributed the cardio-
protective effects of this phenomenon to the moder-
ate consumption of alcoholic beverages, especially red 
wine, which was highly consumed in the area. Although 
Renaud and de Lorgeril strengthened their association 
between wine consumption and IHD by controlling 
for dairy fat intake,63 other authors have argued that 
there were characteristics and confounding variables 
not controlled for in their analysis (drinking patterns, 
lifestyle characteristics, dietary intake, human behavior) 
which may have led to such a correlation.64
Role of Wine Versus Other Alcoholic 
Beverages on IHD and Total Mortality
A J- or U-shaped relationship between alcohol con-
sumption and total mortality has been well docu-
mented,65 with the first incidence being reported as a 
U-shaped curve between IHD mortality for heavy male 
smokers and nonsmokers in the Framingham Heart 
Study.66 Since then, several investigators have focused 
on exploring the effects of specific alcoholic beverages 
on IHD. An L-shaped relation between cardiovascular 
mortality and alcohol intake has been shown,67 imply-
ing that a low dose of alcohol intake can have protec-
tive effects that do not decrease with elevated intakes. 
Many studies have reported inverse associations be-
tween specific types of alcoholic drinks and IHD. No 
consistent pattern of a specific type of alcoholic drink 
(wine, beer, or spirits) reducing the risk of IHD has been 
confirmed, rather a strong epidemiological accord that 
all alcoholic drinks are linked with a reduction in risk 
from IHD, if not consumed in excessive amounts, or 
binged on. Rimm and colleagues64 conducted a sys-
tematic review assessing the risk of specific alcoholic 
drinks on IHD. Focusing on ecological, case-controlled, 
and cohort studies, they identified 4 investigations that 
reported an inverse association between wine intake 
and IHD and mortality,68–71 4 that correlated beer intake 
and coronary events,68,72–74 and 3 with an emphasis on a 
correlation for spirits.2,74,75 A summary of selected major 
clinical studies reporting the associations between IHD 
and alcohol consumption, including wine, is presented 
in Table 4. The 3 largest prospective studies mentioned

526 women; 81 
825 men and women; 51

men),2,69,71 where the absolute consumption of wine, 
beer, and spirits would be the greatest, found that the 
risk of IHD was lower with all 3 types of drinks, with no 
particular drink emerging as a clear winner.64
A prospective observational study by Klatsky and 
Armstrong71 found that individuals who preferred wine 
were at a lower risk of death from IHD, after compari-
sons with spirits drinkers as a reference group (RR, 0.7; 
95% CI, 0.5–0.9). To support their findings, this group 
reported an inverse association between IHD risk and 
frequency of wine consumption, but they were not able 
to confidently conclude that wine confers a greater 
protective advantage because of user differences and 
the inability to control for all potentially confounding 
variables. A Danish cohort study68 assessing the popula-
tion for all 3 types of alcoholic drinks in a homogeneous 
setting, where not 1 alcoholic drink predominated, 
found a significant decrease in mortality, from IHD and 
all causes, among wine drinkers, at all levels of alcoholic 
intake. Conversely, light alcohol drinkers who avoided 
wine had a relatively higher risk of death from IHD than 
drinkers who consumed wine (RR, 0.76; CI, 0.63–0.92 
versus RR, 0.58; CI, 0.47–0.72). Additional evidence of 
the cardioprotective effects of wine from IHD is pro-
vided by the results of the GISSI (Gruppo Italiano per 
lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell’Infarto miocardico)-
Prevenzione trial,70 which found that moderate wine 
consumption (≤0.5 L/d) was associated with a signifi-
cant reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events.
Examining the association between beer and IHD, 
the Honolulu Heart Study, a prospective epidemiologi-
cal investigation,72 found a significant negative correla-
tion between moderate alcohol consumption of beer 
and death from IHD during a 6-year follow-up period. 
Such association for wine was not found, but beer was 
the predominantly consumed drink in the population. 
Further support for beer is provided by the MONICA 
(Monitoring Trends and Determinants of Cardiovascular 
Diseases) Augsburg cohort study,67 in which a protec-
tive effect from light-to-moderate drinking of alcohol 
was observed in a predominantly beer-drinking popula-
tion. Risk reduction from IHD was close to 50%, and 
the L-shaped relationship was also confirmed.67 For 
spirits, Salonen et al75 reported that consumption at 
least once a week was associated with a reduced risk of 
acute myocardial infarction among IHD-free men aged 
30 to 59 (RR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3–0.9). Furthermore, in 
a study by Rimm et al,2 in which spirits were the most 
commonly consumed drink, found that they were also 
the most cardioprotective by having a significant in-
verse association between consumption and risk of IHD 
(P=0.0004).
The Debate Around Light-to-Moderate 
Intake of Wine and Other Alcoholic 
Beverages
Although an inverse relationship between alcohol con-
sumption and risk of IHD has been extensively docu-
mented in studies using an epidemiological design, 
there is a debate regarding which of the 3 drinks pro-
vides better cardiovascular benefits, or on a broader 
scale, if alcohol itself can provide protective benefits. 
One side of the argument is presented by Rehm et al,12 
who argue that alcohol consumption contributes to

the global chronic disease burden, and further evi-
dence suggests that high doses of alcohol consump-
tion confer a disadvantage to the heart, especially with 
an increased risk of arrhythmia, sudden cardiac death, 
alcoholic cardiomyopathy, and hypertension, among 
others.76 The other side of the argument is presented 
in the literature on light-to-moderate alcohol consump-
tion, which is in favor of a reduction in IHD and total 
mortality.3 Yano et al72 were successful in showing a 
strong negative correlation between moderate alcohol 
consumption and incidence of IHD for all 3 beverages, 
supporting the idea of the protective benefit of mod-
erate alcohol consumption. The findings of moderate 
alcohol consumption were further supported by clinical 
angiography studies77 that show a reduction in athero-
sclerosis and average IHD.
As for wine, Grønbæk68 showed that, in a Danish 
cohort, IHD mortality decreased across levels of stable 
drinking, and that wine (8–21 drinks/wk) conferred a 
greater protective effect than the intake of light-to-
moderate beer or spirits. In Oakland and San Francisco 
populations, it was shown that light drinkers were at 
low risk of IHD, with the greatest reduction observed in 
older populations.78 The investigators further showed 
that wine preference and its consumption were as-
sociated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular 
death (RR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6–0.9; P=0.01), with no such 
correlation observed for beer or spirits.
Significant inverse associations were reported for 
the 3 alcoholic beverages, especially wine, albeit with 
limitations, because of their epidemiological and clini-
cal study design. There were populations in whom 
consumption of a single type of drink prevailed over 
another, and in most cases, that drink conferred the 
greater effect. Drinking patterns, lifestyle character-
istics, dietary intake, and risk factors varied in the 
populations studied; hence, these could be potential 
confounding variables for such associations.64 There 
are methodological inconsistencies present among all 
studies, and they make it difficult to draw causal inter-
pretations regarding a specific type of alcoholic drink 
providing cardioprotective effects, but rather support 
the finding that alcohol intake of all beverages as a 
whole is linked with a reduction in risk from IHD, if 
not consumed excessively or binged on. Considering 
the aforementioned limitations and methodological 
inconsistencies present in observational and epidemio-
logical studies, one should be cautious when provid-
ing general recommendations to the public. Is it time 
to change our approach to find the answer? Some 
have suggested doing prospectively controlled, dou-
ble-blinded randomized clinical trials,15 but the ethical 
dilemma of pursuing such an endeavor still needs to 
be debated within the scientific community. For now, 
we shall rely on the evidence at present to make an 
informed decision.
Acute, Sustained, or No Consumption: 
Which Is Better?
Most epidemiological and population-based literature 
surrounding alcoholic beverages considers their sustained 
consumption to be cardioprotective for IHD-associated 
mortality.79 Acute and sustained excessive consumption 
in the form of binge drinking is associated with arrhyth-
mias (holiday heart syndrome), transient ischemic attack, 
and sudden cardiac death.76 Hence, regulation of dos-
age is a very important consideration among drinkers. 
Red wine polyphenols in an acute setting postprandial, 
however, have been shown to exert antioxidant and anti-
inflammatory effects. Covas et al25 reviewed randomized 
controlled human studies on the effects of sustained 
wine usage on oxidation. They reported contradictory 
studies80,81 for an increase in plasma antioxidant activity 
after sustained wine consumption in healthy partici-
pants. It must be noted that these studies used paral-
lel and crossover study designs with small sample sizes 
(n=78 and 40, respectively). The participants were also 
not followed up throughout their lifetimes, all possible 
reasons for the reported contradiction.
Is one worse off consuming no wine or any alcoholic 
drink? From a public health perspective, no, because 
dependence on alcohol only adds to the growing co-
hort of alcohol use disorders.13 There are studies, how-
ever, that have presented compelling evidence for ab-
stinence from alcohol being a risk factor for myocardial 
infarction82 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.83
DEALCOHOLIZED RED WINE: 
CARDIOPROTECTION OF WINE 
POLYPHENOLS BEYOND ETHANOL
It is common to dealcoholize wine, and special atten-
tion is paid during the manufacturing process to ensure 
no loss of polyphenols. With such a drink, effects of 
polyphenols can be studied in isolation. Oxidative modi-
fications in LDL are thought to be an initiator for the de-
velopment of atherosclerosis, whereas polyphenols are 
thought to prevent this oxidative stress and enhance 
plasma antioxidant capability by being present.84 Inhibi-
tion of LDL oxidation is one of the proposed mecha-
nisms by which polyphenols delay the onset of athero-
sclerosis and reduce cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, 
red wine and components catechins and anthocyanins 
inhibited in vitro LDL oxidation, whereas ethanol and 
dealcoholized red wine did not affect measured oxida-
tion levels.84 These observations were also present in 
wine with ethanol; here, we confirm the same results in 
dealcoholized red wine. To evaluate the effects of wine 
polyphenols and their antioxidant potential, Serafini et 
al85 conducted a human pilot study of patients with IHD 
and showed that ingestion of dealcoholized red but not

white wine at 1-week intervals greatly increased in vitro 
plasma antioxidant capacity, with this effect being cred-
ited to red wine polyphenols, which are found in much 
greater concentrations in red wine than in white.85 An 
investigation by Stein et al86 reported that ingestion 
of purple grape juice (devoid of ethanol) was associ-
ated with improved endothelial function via a reduction 
in susceptibility of LDL-cholesterol to oxidation in 15 
adults with IHD.
Red wine polyphenols have also been hypothesized 
to exert positive effects on flow-mediated vasodilation, 
which is known to be endothelium-dependent. In the 
Stein et al86 cohort, grape juice was also associated with 
improved flow-mediated vasodilation of the brachial ar-
tery, which would in turn improve endothelial function. 
Treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells 
with dealcoholized red wine led to a 3.0-fold increase 
in NO release, and a 2.0-fold increase in human endo-
thelial NO synthase, an enzyme isoform that synthesiz-
es NO.87 In addition, dealcoholized red wine polyphenol 
extract has been found to almost completely reverse 
the prothrombotic effects of a 2% cholesterol-rich diet 
by a NO-dependent mechanism.88 Red wine polyphe-
nols have displayed potent antioxidant properties in 
vivo for arterial stiffness. Dealcoholized red wine has 
been acutely demonstrated to reduce arterial stiffness 
60 minutes postprandial intake in patients with coro-
nary artery disease, with this reduction attributed to red 
wine antioxidants.89
ALCOHOL AND CARDIOPROTECTION: 
IMPLICATIONS FOR CAUSALITY FROM 
OBSERVATIONAL EVIDENCE
Much of the evidence regarding alcohol consumption 
and its beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system 
derives from observational data. Epidemiological stud-
ies have been integral to this discussion, with multiple 
cohorts with cross-cultural and geographical compari-
sons reaching similar conclusions. That being said, can 
one infer causality from epidemiological investigations 
using an observational-based approach, in which sub-
ject bias is inherent with self-reported data?
To determine causation, randomized controlled trials 
have long been considered the gold standard. Howev-
er, epidemiological, public health, and clinical research 
are sometimes barred by ethical concerns, where, for 
instance, an experimental treatment such as alcohol be-
ing investigated for a therapeutic cause may leave par-
ticipants in harm’s way.90 Nonetheless, several methods 
have been developed to make causal inferences from 
epidemiological research, starting with the seminal set 
of criteria proposed by Austin Hill, to distinguish causal 
and correlational associations.91 Since then, other meth-
ods have been developed. Some common ones used 
today include instrumental variables regression analysis, 
difference in differences, and regression discontinuity 
designs.90 These methods seek to use a randomized ap-
proach, assigning variables to observational data and 
using mathematical models to associate the effects of a 
treatment with measured health outcomes. Evaluating 
for causal inferences in epidemiology is a growing inter-
est, and it is worthwhile to stress that, in cases where 
longitudinal epidemiological evidence overwhelmingly 
points in one direction, when a large number of studies 
are arriving at similar conclusions, when many proposed 
mechanisms of action are biologically sound and under-
standable, and when the aforementioned statistical ap-
proaches also associate the treatment positively to the 
health outcome, one can begin to suggest causal links.
Decades of longitudinal data have shown an 
improvement in cardiovascular risk factors with 
low-to-moderate alcohol and wine consumption. 
Very recently, studies based on Mendelian random-
ization approaches, an instrumental variables analy-
sis using genetic variants as instruments for analysis, 
have questioned the cardiovascular benefits of alcohol 
consumption.92 In the context of alcohol, Mendelian 
randomization studies seek to provide evidence of 
causal relationships and provide a magnitude of the 
risk associated with lifelong alcohol use by comparing 
genotypes of interest.92 Two large European studies 
(N=261 991; 54 604) using a Mendelian randomization 
approach to explore causal effects of long-term alco-
hol consumption on IHD and cardiovascular risk fac-
tors (body mass index, blood pressure, interleukin, and 
lipid levels) by assessing variants of the alcohol dehy-
drogenase (ADH1B and ADHIC) gene reported adverse 
effects of alcohol consumption on the cardiovascular 
risk profile and an increased risk of IHD.93,94 Further 
evidence by Yun et al95 reports detrimental effects of 
alcohol consumption on coronary calcification in the 
Korean population. These studies stand in contrast to 
the epidemiological investigations.
PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
Because alcohol is a ubiquitous part of culture, its ever-
increasing consumption today because of industrializa-
tion and globalization also increases the adverse ef-
fects associated with its intake.13 Alcohol consumption 
in excessive amounts can lead to social and personal 
ramifications not only for individuals, but also for the 
population as a whole.96 Intoxication still remains a 
major factor in adverse events such as car crashes and 
domestic violence, both of which are major problems 
for public health.97,98 Rehm et al13 explain how some 
diseases are causally linked to alcohol and would not 
exist if alcohol was not a contributor to our day-to-day 
lives. These include alcoholic liver disease, alcohol use 
disorder, and pancreatitis induced by alcohol. Further

analysis by this group on alcohol-associated detriments 
finds that in 2004, 3.8% of global mortality was alco-
hol-associated, greater for men (6.3%) than for women 
(1.1%). They report the cause of these deaths to be 
from injury, cancer, liver cirrhosis, and cardiovascular 
diseases. Surprisingly, the authors find that almost all 
preventable deaths were from the cardiovascular cat-
egory. However, this does not take away from the fact 
that, on average, alcohol is detrimentally linked to many 
diseases and increases the global disease burden.13
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WINE 
CONSUMPTION
The most comprehensive manual for healthcare profes-
sionals is the WHO guide for hazardous and harmful 
drinking.18 It provides healthcare professionals a day-
to-day guide on dealing with patients who are more 
inclined to abuse alcohol. Important sections include 
concepts and terms related to the use and abuse of 
alcohol, intervention guidelines, 4 zones of risk man-
agement, definition of a standard drink, and guidelines 
for low-risk alcohol consumption. The 2015 to 2020 
Dietary Guidelines for Americans10 recommend a mod-
erate consumption of alcohol (≤2 std/d men; ≤1 std/d 
women; 1 standard drink=14 g of pure ethanol). Ex-
cessive consumption (≥5 std/d men; ≥4 std/d women) 
and binge drinking (≥5 std/d men; ≥4 std/d women 
within 2 hours) are discouraged. High-risk individuals 
(alcoholics, pregnant or breastfeeding women, indi-
viduals on prescribed medications) are advised not to 
consume alcohol. The American Heart Association ad-
visories99,100 conclude that a moderate intake of alco-
hol (1–2 drinks/d) is associated with a reduction in IHD 
risk with no clear consensus of wine conferring greater 
benefits than alcoholic beverages. For women, how-
ever, suggested consumption was of no more than 1 
drink/d.99 To substantially reduce cardiovascular disease 
risk, their recommendation is to focus on a consump-
tion of a healthy diet.100
Conclusions
Despite a lack of consensus on a specific type of bever-
age being beneficial to the heart, mounting evidence 
suggests that ethanol and polyphenols within wine can 
synergistically confer benefits against chronic cardio-
vascular diseases, mostly IHD. The polyphenols in red 
wine can be divided into 2 important groups, flavo-
noids and nonflavonoids, that together can decrease 
platelet aggregation, improve fibrinolysis, increase HDL 
cholesterol, and promote NO release.
Discrepancies remain for the definition of a standard 
drink, with the WHO definition of 10 g not adopted in-
ternationally. A light-to-moderate intake is considered 
cardioprotective by epidemiological and experimental 
investigations after observations of an inverse correla-
tion for IHD.
