Abstract
Abstract 
35 
Background: There is a pressing need for blood pressure control strategies with improved efficacy and 
36 
tolerability. We examine whether using ultra-low dose quadruple combination therapy provides an 
37 
approach with greater efficacy and tolerability.  
38 
Methods: We conducted a systematic review of trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of quarter-
39 
standard dose BP-lowering therapy against placebo and a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 
40 
cross-over trial of a ‘quadpill’: a single capsule containing four BP-lowering medicines each at quarter-
41 
dose (irbesartan 37.5mg, amlodipine 1.25mg, hydrochlorothiazide 6.25mg and atenolol 12.5mg). 
42 
Participants with untreated hypertension received either quadpill or matching placebo for four weeks, 
43 
followed by a two-week wash-out and then the other treatment for four weeks. The primary outcome 
44 
was placebo-corrected 24-hour systolic ambulatory BP reduction after four weeks.  
45 
Findings: Our systematic review identified 36 trials (n=4,721) of single quarter-dose and six trials (n=312) 
46 
of dual quarter-dose therapy against placebo. The pooled placebo-corrected BP-lowering effects were 
47 
5/2mmHg and 7/5mmHg (both p<0.0001) respectively, and there were no side effects from either 
48 
regimen. The trial is complete and stopped recruiting due to inadequate funding. It randomised 20 
49 
patients, whose mean age was 60 years and mean baseline office and 24-hour systolic BP levels were 
50 
154/90 and 138/87mmHg, respectively. Two patients dropped out for administrative reasons.  The 
51 
placebo-corrected reduction in systolic 24-hour BP on quadpill was 19mmHg (95%CI 14-23) and office BP 
52 
was reduced by 22/13mmHg (p<0.001). During quadpill treatment 18/18 (100%) achieved office 
53 
BP<140/90mmHg, compared to 6/18 (33%) during placebo treatment (p=0.0013). There were no serious 
54 
adverse events and all patients reported that the quadpill was easy to swallow.  
55 
Interpretation: This small trial in the context of previous randomised evidence indicates that the 
56 
benefits of quarter-dose therapy are additive across classes, and are likely to confer a clinically 
57 
important BP reduction. Further examination of the quadpill concept is needed to examine effectiveness 
58 
against usual treatment options and longer term tolerability.

 INTRODUCTION
INTRODUCTION 
65 
High blood pressure (BP) is a leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality,1 and the benefits of 
66 
BP lowering treatments are well established.2,3  Despite the plethora of BP lowering medicines available 
67 
and the fact that most patients receive some treatment, multiple large-scale population studies 
68 
demonstrate poor BP control in many patients globally.4 
69 
Multiple factors contribute to poor BP control including low adherence rates, complex guidelines 
70 
recommending multiple up-titration steps and treatment inertia. The majority of treated patients only 
71 
receive monotherapy,4 which has low potency even at high doses.5 Furthermore the increasingly strong 
72 
evidence of benefits of more intensive BP lowering6,7 highlights the need for new treatment strategies 
73 
that are more efficacious, while remaining tolerable. Low-dose combination therapy holds considerable 
74 
promise in this regard, since at low doses most side effects are avoided and most benefits are 
75 
maintained.8   
76 
However, there is uncertainty about effects at ultra-low doses and whether combinations can achieve 
77 
clinically relevant BP reductions. We therefore sought to assess efficacy and tolerability of ultra-low 
78 
dose combination therapy by conducting a systematic review of quarter-dose BP lowering therapies and 
79 
a trial of a ‘quadpill’, containing four common BP lowering medications each at quarter-dose.  
80 
METHODS

81 
Systematic review
Systematic review 
82 
We conducted a systematic review of all randomised trials of quarter-dose BP therapy, identifying 
83 
potentially relevant studies from searches of EMBASE, MEDLINE and Cochrane Central Registry of 
84 
Controlled Trials, with each source searched from inception to June 2016; and the Food and Drug 
85 
Administration and European Medicines Agency websites. Medline search terms are in appendix 1.   
86 
Searches of trial registers were performed for any ongoing trials including World Health Organization 
87 
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO-ICTRP), Australia New Zealand Clinical Trial Register 
88 
(ANZCTR) and Clinical Trials Registry – India (CTRI). Retrieval of studies from reference lists of key clinical 
89 
trials, systematic reviews and published articles was also undertaken. Reference lists of eligible studies 
90 
and systematic reviews were also reviewed. (Appendix Figure 1) We included randomised controlled 
91 
trials of adult participants (≥18 years of age) examining quarter-standard dose BP-lowering drugs against 
92 
placebo for the following drug classes: angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor II 
93 
blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics. Quarter dose 
94 
was quarter of the standard dose, defined as the most frequently reported usual maintenance dose 
95 
recorded by the British National Formulary,9 Martindales and Monthly Index of Medical Specialties.10 
96 
Two reviewers (AB, MC) independently extracted data using a standard extraction form.  A third 
97 
reviewer (AR) resolved any differences.  Data were analysed using Comprehensive Meta-analysis 
98 
Software (v3, Englewood NJ). We a fixed-effect model to estimate the effects on BP lowering and on 
99 
adverse events of quarter dose BP lowering against placebo. Effect on BP was assessed using the mean 
100 
 change in systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline to end-of-study, with standardisation to 
101 
a baseline of 150/95mmHg.8 Adverse events included all that were reported by trials at follow up.

104 
The Quadpill study was a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over trial (Figure 1). 
105 
Participants were randomised (1:1) to a group receiving the quadpill for four weeks, followed by a two-
106 
week placebo washout and then placebo for four weeks; or to a group receiving placebo, then washout, 
107 
then Quadpill for the same periods. Participants were recruited from the community, predominantly 
108 
through general practices in Western Sydney, Australia. Participants were eligible if they met the 
109 
following inclusion criteria: 1) adults aged 18 years and over; 2) office SBP>140mmHg and/or DBP> 
110 
90mmHg on two readings on separate days; 3) baseline ambulatory SBP >135mmHg and/or DBP 
111 
>85mmHg; and 4) not taking any BP medications. Exclusion criteria included: 1) definite contraindication 
112 
to one or more component medications in the quadpill; 2) the responsible clinician considered that a 
113 
change in current therapy would place the patient at risk; 3) severe or accelerated hypertension; 4) 
114 
pregnancy; 5) inability to provide informed consent; and 6) medical illness with anticipated life 
115 
expectancy less than 3 months. The study protocol was approved by the Human Research and Ethics 
116 
committee at The University of Sydney and funded by a Vanguard Grant and Ross Hohnen prize from the 
117 
National Heart Foundation of Australia (Grant number 100227), University of Sydney Bridging Grant and 
118 
National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia program grant. Informed consent was 
119 
obtained from all participants. The study is registered with the Australian and New-Zealand Clinical Trials 
120 
Registry (ACTRN 12614001057673).  
121 
Intervention
Intervention and randomisation
and randomisation 
122 
The quadpill was a single encapsulated pill containing four common BP lowering medicines each at 
123 
quarter-standard dose (irbesartan 37.5mg, amlodipine 1.25mg, hydrochlorothiazide 6.25mg and 
124 
atenolol 12.5mg). Quarter- doses were obtained by halving half- doses using a pill splitting device, 
125 
without crushing, and were weighed to ensure accuracy of halving doses. The quarter doses were then 
126 
encapsulated using gelatine capsules (DBCaps- Capsugel).11 All trial medicines were prepared and 
127 
packaged at a Therapeutic Goods Australia – Certificate of Good Manufacturing Practice licensed 
128 
manufacturing facility. 
129 
Treatment allocations were at random via a computer assisted randomisation sequence and were 
130 
blinded to both study staff and participants.  The placebo capsule appeared identical and contained four 
131 
placebo tablets of similar weight to those in the quadpill. Participants were administered a single daily 
132 
capsule quadpill or placebo throughout the trial. Patients were instructed to take the capsules at the 
133 
same time each day, preferably in the morning. In addition to the study drugs, all participants were 
134 
provided education on healthy lifestyle options as recommended by then current local BP management 
135 
guidelines.12  
136 
 Outcomes and 
Outcomes and data collection
ata collection 
137 
The primary outcome was reduction in mean 24-hour SBP at 4 weeks using ambulatory BP monitoring 
138 
(ABP). The secondary outcomes included:  
139 
1) Reduction in mean 24-hour DBP and in daytime and night-time SBP and DBP at 4 weeks 
140 
2) Reduction in office SBP and DBP as measured by a standardised automated BP cuff 
141 
3) Proportion with controlled BP at 4 weeks, defined as <135/85mmHg 24-hour ABP and 
142 
<140/90mmHg office BP 
143 
4) Adverse events and pre-specified adverse events with laboratory-associated parameters: rise in 
144 
transaminases (ALT/AST) more than three times the upper limit of normal or doubling if baseline 
145 
levels known to be elevated; drop in estimated glomerular filtration rate by >20% as estimated from 
146 
serum creatinine; change in sodium, potassium and uric acid levels  
147 
5) Assessment of acceptability and tolerability 
148 
Patients underwent 24-hour ABP monitoring 4 times - baseline (off study drug), 4 weeks (on phase 1 
149 
treatment or placebo), 6 weeks (after 2 week placebo washout) and 10 weeks (on phase 3 treatment or 
150 
placebo). The ABP units were calibrated at regular intervals by the laboratory according to the 
151 
manufacturer’s specification. Office BP was recorded three times at each visit using an OMRON T9P 
152 
(HEM-759-C1). The second and the third readings were averaged for study analysis. In addition, at week 
153 
4 and week 10 blood biochemistry and a questionnaire for clinical side effects and medication 
154 
compliance were administered. At study end, drug acceptability and tolerability were assessed. We 
155 
recorded all adverse events. In addition, we specifically asked about clinical adverse events possibly 
156 
associated with BP lowering medications: dizziness, blurred vision, syncope/collapse, chest pain/angina, 
157 
shortness of breath, cough, wheeze, pedal oedema, skin rash, or itching. Study medications and 
158 
investigations were provided at no cost to participants and nominal amounts to cover travel and parking 
159 
costs were reimbursed.

Statistical considerations: 
Statistical considerations:  
161 
A sample size of 50 patients was planned to provide 90% power at α =0.05 to detect a SBP difference of 
162 
12mmHg between the intervention and control, assuming a SD of the within patient difference of 
163 
12mmHg and taking into account the possibility of a 10% loss to follow-up. The study ended at one year 
164 
at the end of the budget and staffing time allocated and the original sample size was not reached.  
165 
Analyses were conducted on an intention to treat basis.  All tests were two-sided. All statistical analyses 
166 
were unadjusted for prognostic covariates. We reported compliance to the study drug using data on pills 
167 
(doses) taken and missed doses over the time period. We used a linear mixed model to estimate the 
168 
effect of the treatment on change in BP from baseline for each treatment period, according to the 
169 
Kenward and Roger approach.13 All available data were included in the model; no missing data were 
170 
imputed. If a patient had missing data for one period, data from the available period were used. A 
171 
sensitivity analysis was done including only patients with data available from both periods to see if the 
172 
effect of treatment was modified. We also adjusted the denominator degrees of freedom of Kenward 
173 
and Roger (2009)14 to optimize for the small sample size. 
174 
 We tested for carry over with an unpaired t-test of the main outcome with order as an effect. Period 
175 
effect was tested by using a paired t-test comparing the main outcome in period 1 with main outcome in 
176 
period 2 from the same patient. We also performed a sensitivity analysis using normal paired t-test to 
177 
compare primary outcome between different period (different treatment) from the same patient, 
178 
ignoring the baseline level of each period. 
179 
Continuous secondary endpoints with baseline values (e.g. daytime/ night-time ambulatory SBP/DBP) 
180 
were analysed similarly to the primary endpoint. Other continuous variables without a baseline value in 
181 
each period were analysed with a paired t-test.  We have reported counts and percentages of all 
182 
adverse events.  
183 
We tested for interaction of treatment effect with age (≤60 vs. >60 years), gender, and body mass index 
184 
(BMI ≤30 vs. >30 kg/m2). We also carried out subgroup analyses for each variable. Trial analyses were 
185 
conducted using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC, USA) software.

192 
In the systematic review we identified 36 trials (4,721 participants)  that reported the efficacy of single 
193 
quarter dose BP lowering compared to placebo. (Appendix table 1) Pooling the data, quarter dose BP-
194 
lowering drugs reduced SBP by 4.7mmHg (95% CI -5.4 to -3.9) and DBP by 2.4mmHg (95% CI -2.8 to -
195 
1.9). (Figure 2)  Further 14 of these trials (n=1,838) reported adverse events in single quarter dose 
196 
versus placebo. Overall single quarter-dose agents had no increase in adverse events compared to 
197 
placebo (Risk Ratio [RR] 1.0, 95% CI 0.88 – 1.10). Six trials (n=312) also examined dual quarter dose 
198 
against placebo and found a reduction in SBP and DBP of 6.7mmHg (95% CI -4.8 to -8.6) and 4.4mmHg 
199 
(95% CI -3.3 to -5.5) respectively and no increase in side effects compared to placebo (RR 0.93, 95% CI 
200 
0.29 – 2.9). No trials of triple or quadruple quarter dose therapy versus placebo were identified.  
201 
In the quadpill trial, 55 patients were screened, and 21 participants found eligible, one patient declined 
202 
prior to drug initiation. Twenty were randomised between November 2014 and December 2015 and two 
203 
withdrew at the end of the first treatment period because of social reasons (Figure 3). Baseline 
204 
characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1.  
205 
The difference in mean 24-hour SBP between quadpill and placebo periods was –18.7mmHg (95% CI -
206 
23.0 to -14.3) and 24-hour DBP was –14.2mmHg (94% CI -16.9 to -11.5). Similarly the difference in office 
207 
SBP was -22.4mmHg (95% CI 16.5 to 28.3) and office DBP –13.1mmHg (95% CI 8.9 to 17.3). Daytime 
208 
ASBP, daytime ADBP, night-time ASBP and night-time ADBP were all significantly lower with quadpill 
209 
(Table 2). All participants achieved an office SBP <140 and DBP<90mmHg on the quadpill compared to 
210 
 6/18 (33%) while on placebo (RR 3.01, 95% CI 1.54; 5.89; p=0.0013). ABP<135/85mmHgwas achieved by 
211 
15/18 (83%) while on the quadpill compared to 7/18 (39%) while on placebo, (RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.25-3.65; 
212 
p=0.0053) 
213 
 
214 
Tests for both a carryover effect (t=-0.17, p=0.868) and a period effect (t=-1.05, p=0.308) were not 
215 
significant. There were no significant interactions by age, sex or BMI. In sensitivity analysis using a 
216 
standard comparison (paired t-test), results were virtually identical with a difference in mean 24-hour 
217 
SBP between the quadpill and placebo periods of -18.7mmHg (95% CI -23.1 to -14.2). Similarly, in a 
218 
second sensitivity analysis that included only patients with complete data (n=18) from both periods, 
219 
results were also virtually identical with the difference in mean 24-hour SBP of -18.7 (95% CI -23.2 to -
220 
14.2).  
221 
Treatment compliance was high with the mean number of capsules missed in the last week 0.2 (SD 0.4) 
222 
for quadpill and 0.3 (SD 0.6) for placebo. All 18 participants who finished the study completed the end-
223 
of-study acceptability questionnaire, with all reporting the study medication was either very easy (n=13) 
224 
or easy (n=5) to swallow. In addition, all 18 participants reported it was either very likely (n=10) or likely 
225 
(n=8) they would take the quadpill if available for use. 
226 
There were no serious adverse events and no patients had a pre-specified adverse events. One 
227 
participant reported dizziness while on the quadpill causing temporary discontinuation of treatment; 
228 
one reported vertigo during the washout period on placebo; and one reported urinary frequency in 
229 
quadpill and placebo phases (see Table 3).  
230 
The mean heart rate was lower on Quadpill treatment, difference between groups of 6.5 beats per 
231 
minute (95% CI 2.3 to 10.6). There was a difference in changes in creatinine (4.4, 95% CI 0.9 – 7.8 
232 
mmol/L; p=0.02) and urate (0.03, 95% CI 0.001 – 0.04 mmol/L; p=0.003) in the quadpill compared to the 
233 
placebo treatment periods,  but no patient had more than a 12% increase in either variable. There were 
234 
no significant differences in ALT, AST, sodium, potassium, total cholesterol or LDL-cholesterol. (Appendix 
235 
table 3)

This study found that a capsule containing four quarter-dose BP lowering drugs reduced 24-hour 
241 
ambulatory BP by 19/14mmHg and achieved office BP <140/90mmHg in all participants. This BP 
242 
lowering effect is consistent with the findings of our systematic review that single quarter-dose therapy 
243 
produces a 5/2mmHg BP reduction against placebo and that dual quarter-dose therapy produces 
244 
additional effects on BP.8  Together with findings from our systematic review that single or dual quarter-
245 
dose therapy produces no increase in side effects compared to placebo, these findings indicate 
246 
 considerable potential advantages for a single capsule containing multiple BP lowering drugs in ultra-low 
247 
dose.  
248 
There has been one prior trial of quadruple quarter-dose BP-lowering versus monotherapy, involving 
249 
110 untreated individuals with BP >140/90mmHg.15 That trial observed a 26/15mmHg reduction in BP 
250 
from a baseline of 160/96mmHg with therapy comprising amlodipine 1.25mg, atenolol 12.5mg, 
251 
bendroflumethiazide 0.625mg and captopril 50mg, which was significantly greater than the reduction 
252 
seen with each monotherapy at standard dose - compared with individual agents, the combination 
253 
showed a greater systolic BP reduction than amlodipine (8 mmHg, 95% CI 1 to 14mmHg), atenolol (9, 2 
254 
to 16 mmHg), bendroflumethiazide (11, 4 to 18mmHg) and captopril (7, 1 to 14mmHg). The only other 
255 
trial to date of low-dose antihypertensive therapy with more than two agents assessed triple half-dose 
256 
therapy vs. placebo in a crossover trial and demonstrated a similarly large BP difference of 18/10mmHg 
257 
(p<0.001).16  
258 
The main limitations of this trial is the small sample size and short follow-up duration and the minimal 
259 
power it had to evaluate side effects. A major barrier to recruitment was identifying untreated 
260 
individuals with elevated BP within the settings in which we work. The systematic review findings and 
261 
previous related trials15,16 suggest consistency in effect sizes and supports the minimal side effects 
262 
observed. The strengths of this study include the randomised cross-over design maximising statistical 
263 
power and minimising bias.  
264 
Small but statistically significant increases in creatinine and urate were observed in this trial, with no 
265 
patient experiencing more than a 12% increase in either measure. There were no longer term follow-up 
266 
data and any clinical implications are uncertain. Lower systemic pressure can reduce glomerular 
267 
perfusion pressure and lead to longer term renal benefits for people with raised intraglomerular 
268 
pressure and proteinuria.17,18 19,20 However, trials have also observed an increase in adverse renal 
269 
outcomes with intensive BP lowering.7,21,22 To determine the clinical implications of the creatinine 
270 
differences observed in this study,  studies with further long-term data are required. 
271 
Sub-optimal BP control is a global problem.4,23  Initiating treatment with dual combination therapy has 
272 
been advocated24 as a more effective means to achieve BP control rapidly and with fewer clinical visits.25 
273 
Our study draws on the same underlying principles but extends the concept further to initiating 
274 
treatment with multiple ultra-low dose agents in a single capsule.26 In comparison to existing 
275 
approaches to BP lowering therapy, administration of a single quadruple combination capsule is likely to 
276 
achieve more BP lowering than up-titrating monotherapy, since doubling the dose for BP drugs from 
277 
half-dose to full dose provides only about 1-2mmHg further reduction in BP.8 In addition a quadpill 
278 
approach could address physician and patient-related treatment inertia as it reduces the need for 
279 
stepped titration. It also addresses the individual variation in responsiveness to different agents through 
280 
provision of a combination with a range of modes of action. Improved adherence is also likely as a result 
281 
of both decreased pill burden27 and use of lower doses to minimise side effects.8   
282 
In summary, this is the first placebo-controlled trial demonstrating that quarter-dose quadruple 
283 
combination therapy is highly efficacious in lowering BP. It presents a novel approach that could achieve 
284 
 substantially greater BP control with a single pill, which may have wide-spread clinical applicability.  
285 
Further trials are required to assess the long-term efficacy and safety in a broader population, both for 
286 
initial treatment and among patients with inadequate control and/or side effects while receiving 
287 
monotherapy.

Systematic review and meta-analysis of 354 randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trials of BP 
292 
lowering therapy8 identified that doubling of dose from half to full standard dose produced on average a 
293 
22% increase in BP reduction, and that the BP lowering effect of different classes of drugs were additive. 
294 
While most benefits are maintained at half-dose, most side effects were avoided. One trial 
295 
demonstrated a quadruple quarter-dose therapy achieved greater BP reduction than each component at 
296 
standard dose.15

Added value of this study 
Added value of this study  
298 
We systematically reviewed the literature on placebo controlled quarter-dose BP-lowering therapy and 
299 
found placebo-corrected BP reductions with single and dual quarter-dose BP lowering of 5/2mmHg and 
300 
7/5mmHg respectively. These reductions were not associated with any difference in side effects 
301 
compared to placebo. Our trial provides the first placebo-controlled data on a four agent quarter-dose 
302 
‘quadpill’ containing irbesartan 37.5mg, amlodipine 1.25mg, hydrochlorothiazide 6.25mg and atenolol 
303 
12.5mg, combined into a single capsule).  We observed a BP reduction of 19/14 mmHg in 24 hour SBP 
304 
compared to placebo, and 18/18 patients achieved BP <140/90mmHg while receiving Quadpill 
305 
compared to 6/8 while receiving placebo (p<0.001).

Implications of all the available evidence 
Implications of all the available evidence  
307 
This study provides proof of concept for an innovative approach of using ultra-low-dose quadruple 
308 
combination therapy to achieve substantial BP reductions. Further studies are required to examine the 
309 
generalisability of these findings and assess the longer term effects on efficacy, safety and tolerability 
310 
compared to usual care.
