Summary
Background—Annual low-dose CT screening for lung cancer has been recommended for high-
risk individuals, but the necessity of yearly low-dose CT in all eligible individuals is uncertain. 
This study examined rates of lung cancer in National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) participants 
who had a negative prevalence (initial) low-dose CT screen to explore whether less frequent 
screening could be justified in some lower-risk subpopulations.

 Methods—We did a retrospective cohort analysis of data from the NLST, a randomised, 
multicentre screening trial comparing three annual low-dose CT assessments with three annual 
chest radiographs for the early detection of lung cancer in high-risk, eligible individuals (aged 55–
74 years with at least a 30 pack-year history of cigarette smoking, and, if a former smoker, had 
quit within the past 15 years), recruited from US medical centres between Aug 5, 2002, and April 
26, 2004. Participants were followed up for up to 5 years after their last annual screen. For the 
purposes of this analysis, our cohort consisted of all NLST participants who had received a low-
dose CT prevalence (T0) screen. We determined the frequency, stage, histology, study year of 
diagnosis, and incidence of lung cancer, as well as overall and lung cancer-specific mortality, and 
whether lung cancers were detected as a result of screening or within 1 year of a negative screen. 
We also estimated the effect on mortality if the first annual (T1) screen in participants with a 
negative T0 screen had not been done. The NLST is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT00047385.
Findings—Our cohort consisted of 26 231 participants assigned to the low-dose CT screening 
group who had undergone their T0 screen. The 19 066 participants with a negative T0 screen had a 
lower incidence of lung cancer than did all 26 231 T0-screened participants (371·88 [95% CI 
337·97–408·26] per 100 000 person-years vs 661·23 [622·07–702·21]) and had lower lung cancer-
related mortality (185·82 [95% CI 162·17–211·93] per 100 000 person-years vs 277·20 [252·28–
303·90]). The yield of lung cancer at the T1 screen among participants with a negative T0 screen 
was 0·34% (62 screen-detected cancers out of 18 121 screened participants), compared with a 
yield at the T0 screen among all T0-screened participants of 1·0% (267 of 26 231). We estimated 
that if the T1 screen had not been done in the T0 negative group, at most, an additional 28 
participants in the T0 negative group would have died from lung cancer (a rise in mortality from 
185·82 [95% CI 162·17–211·93] per 100 000 person-years to 212·14 [186·80–239·96]) over the 
course of the trial.
Interpretation—Participants with a negative low-dose CT prevalence screen had a lower 
incidence of lung cancer and lung cancer-specific mortality than did all participants who 
underwent a prevalence screen. Because overly frequent screening has associated harms, 
increasing the interval between screens in participants with a negative low-dose CT prevalence 
screen might be warranted.
Introduction
Results of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed that annual low-dose CT 
screening reduced lung cancer mortality in high-risk individuals followed up for up to 5 
years after their last annual screen by about 15–20% relative to a control group receiving 
chest radiographs.1,2 On the basis of these data and results from other screening 
programmes,3–6 annual low-dose CT screening has been advocated in these high-risk 
individuals. However, low-dose CT is not without risk and substantial health-care costs, and 
refinements in screening protocols should be considered to improve the efficiency and cost-
effectiveness of population-based screening programmes.7
Cancer screening is an inherently inefficient process, mainly due to the low prevalence of 
disease. Even in high-risk groups such as cigarette smokers, only a small proportion of 
individuals will be diagnosed with lung cancer. Additionally, some individuals will have a

 false-positive screen, necessitating further assessment: 39% of all NLST trial participants 
who underwent low-dose CT had at least one false-positive screen, although the proportion 
of false-positive screens varied among other screening trials depending on the criteria used 
to define a positive screen. Therefore, distinguishing the vast majority of individuals with 
benign indeterminate nodules from those with lung cancer remains a diagnostic 
dilemma.8–10
Just as importantly, whether annual low-dose CT studies are needed in all high-risk 
individuals is not clear, because no biological justification exists to show that annual 
screening is the optimal screening interval. Increasing the time between screens might be 
warranted if it does not substantially affect mortality, and at the same time reduces the 
number of screens, unnecessary work-ups, invasive procedures, overall radiation dose during 
screening period, and cost. Although several reports have explored the effect of increased 
screening intervals,6,8,11 the aim of our study was to focus on the subset of NLST 
participants who had a negative prevalence (initial) screen on low-dose CT to determine the 
subsequent incidence and mortality of lung cancer in this group, and to estimate the effect on 
mortality if the first annual screen had not been done. Identifying a population in whom less 
frequent screening produces a more favourable benefit-to-harm ratio will inform risk 
prediction models, might reduce the need for annual low-dose CT screens in some 
individuals, and might lead to a more efficient lung cancer screening programme.11–13
Methods
NLST design and participants
This study was a retrospective analysis of data from the NLST, a randomised, multicentre 
screening trial that recruited participants who were at high risk for lung cancer from 33 US 
medical centres. The design, methods, and initial results of the NLST have been previously 
reported.14,15 Briefly, eligible participants were those aged 55–74 years with at least a 30 
pack-year history of cigarette smoking, and if a former smoker, had quit less than 15 years 
before study entry. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either three annual low-
dose CT assessments or three annual single-view posterior-anterior chest radiographs, and 
were then followed up for up to an additional 5 years. The NLST was approved at each of 
the 33 sites by the local institutional review board, and all participants gave written, 
informed consent.
The primary objective of the NLST was to determine if low-dose CT screening, as compared 
with chest radiograph screening, would reduce lung cancer mortality. General 
recommendations for the management of participants with a positive screen were detailed in 
the trial protocol,1,2 although the referring clinician ultimately determined further 
assessment. Trial participants with any negative screen (either prevalence or subsequent 
annual screen) were recommended to return for their next annual screen.14–16
Lung cancer diagnoses were established mainly through the review of standardised data 
forms administered to study participants. Medical abstractors confirmed all lung cancer 
cases using patient medical records, including pathology reports. An independent death 
review committee masked to study group adjudicated whether deaths were due to lung

 cancer (or attributable to the investigation of suspected lung cancer) to compare lung cancer 
mortality between the two screening groups.
As described in the NLST protocol, a positive low-dose CT scan was defined as one or more 
non-calcified nodules at least 4 mm in longest diameter.15 A positive scan also included CT 
findings of a mediastinal mass, pleural disease, or atelectasis in one or more lobes. Other 
radiographic findings, including the presence of emphysema on CT, were also recorded by 
the interpreting radiologist on the appropriate data sheet. The participants were also given a 
questionnaire at the entrance of the study that included several questions related to their past 
medical history, including a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 
family history of cancer. Details of the NLST protocol outlining these features have been 
previously reported.14–16
Procedures
For the purposes of this analysis, we retrospectively reviewed the NLST database to identify 
all lung cancers diagnosed during the trial and lung cancer-related deaths during study 
follow-up in participants in the low-dose CT group of the NLST. We excluded participants 
assigned to the low-dose CT group who had not undergone a prevalence (T0) screen from 
our analysis. We recorded the number of lung cancer cases according to study year of 
diagnosis, stage, histology, and lung cancer-free survival and determined the number of lung 
cancer deaths and deaths from all causes. We also determined the number of lung cancers 
detected as a result of screening and the number diagnosed within 1 year of a negative 
screen. A lung cancer was deemed to be screen-detected if diagnosis occurred within 1 year 
of a positive screen and before the next screen (if any), or if diagnosis occurred more than 1 
year after a positive screen during which time the participant had no further screening but 
did have a sequence of diagnostic procedures prompted by the positive screen and less than a 
1-year gap between procedures. We used the term interval lung cancer to define any lung 
cancer diagnosed within 1 year of a negative screen.
Statistical analysis
Using descriptive statistics, we compared the number of participants who were diagnosed 
with lung cancer at each screening stage. We also compared the yield of the T0 screen—ie, 
the number of screen-detected cancers divided by the total number of participants screened
—in all participants, with the yield of the first annual low-dose CT screen (T1) in the T0 
negative subset of participants.
We determined the incidence of lung cancer and lung cancer-specific mortality during the 
trial in all eligible participants who underwent a T0 screen in the NLST compared with 
participants who had a negative T0 screen. We calculated lung cancer incidence and 
mortality per 100 000 person-years, defined as the ratio of the number of events to the 
person-years at risk for the event. For the incidence of lung cancer, person-years were 
measured from the time of the T0 screen to the date of diagnosis of lung cancer, death, or 
censoring (whichever came first); for mortality, person-years were measured from the time 
of the T0 screen to the date of death from lung cancer, death from another cause, or 
censoring (whichever came first); participants who died from causes other than lung cancer

 were censored at the time of death when estimating lung cancer mortality. Those with 
missing lung cancer data or vital status were censored at the date that they were last known 
to be cancer free or alive, respectively. We also calculated lung cancer incidence and 
mortality per person-years measured from the time of the second annual (T2) screen to the 
date of first event (ie, lung cancer diagnosis for incidence and lung cancer death for 
mortality), death, or censoring (whichever came first). We estimated the relative risks of 
lung cancer incidence and mortality by diagnosis year and screening status, and derived 95% 
CIs using the bootstrap method.
We estimated the upper bound of the potential increase in mortality that would be expected 
if all participants with a negative T0 screen were screened again in 2 years instead of 1 year, 
under the assumption that the T1 screen was not done in participants with a negative T0 
screen, and that all T1-screen-detected cancers were reclassified as a lung cancer-specific 
death, irrespective of the true outcome.
We compared the time to lung cancer diagnosis, incidence of lung cancer, and lung cancer-
specific mortality of participants with a negative T0 screen with those with a positive T0 
screen. For those with a negative T0 screen, we also grouped participants with respect to the 
status of their subsequent T1 and T2 screens and compared those groups (eg, T1 negative vs 
T1 positive).
We used Cox proportional hazards regression to investigate time to lung cancer diagnosis 
(defined as time from T0 screen to lung cancer diagnosis, death or censoring; participants 
who died with no lung cancer diagnosis were censored at the time of death) by screening 
status. We used univariate and multivariable models for each comparison. The full model 
was adjusted for age, sex, race, smoking history, emphysema finding on the T0 screen, 
family history of lung cancer, and self-reported history of COPD.
We examined demographic and clinical features (age, sex, race, smoking history, 
emphysema on T0 screen, history of COPD, and family history of lung cancer) in two Cox 
regression models, to explore factors associated with lung cancer diagnosis after a negative 
T0 screen and in all participants who completed a T0 screen (positive and negative screens). 
We used Kaplan-Meier curves to compare lung cancer-free survival stratified according to 
the following criteria: age (<65 years vs ≥65 years); smoking history (<45 pack-years vs ≥45 
pack-years); age younger than 65 years and smoking history (<45 pack-years vs ≥45 pack-
years); and history of COPD, age 65 years or older, and smoking history of 45 or more pack-
years.
We completed all analyses using SAS statistical software (version 9.4) and Stata statistical 
software (release 14), and used the statistical package R (2014) to create the Kaplan-Meier 
plots.

Results
Participants were enrolled into the NLST between Aug 5, 2002, and April 26, 2004. Annual 
screening was complete by Sept 6, 2007, and individuals were followed up until Dec 31, 
2009. 26 722 participants were randomly assigned to receive three annual low-dose CT 
assessments; 95 participants were subsequently considered ineligible for the trial and an 
additional 396 participants were excluded from our retrospective analysis for having no T0 
screen, leaving 26 231 eligible participants for our analysis (appendix). 78 (82%) of the 95 
participants who were ineligible had a T0 screen; they were found to be ineligible after 
enrolment and randomisation. 19 066 (73%) of 26 231 low-dose CT participants had a 
negative T0 screen and 7165 (27%) had a positive T0 screen (appendix).
Demographic characteristics according to T0 screening status are shown in table 1. 14 686 
participants had negative scans at T0, T1, and T2, and 2762 had a T0 negative scan and a 
positive scan at either T1 or T2 (this number does not include those that did not have a T1 
scan but then went on to have a negative T2 scan; figure 1).
Of 26 231 eligible participants, 1063 (4%) had been diagnosed with lung cancer at the time 
of the last available follow-up. Median time from T0 screen to diagnosis for these 
participants was 2·2 years (95% CI 2·1–2·3). Of the 19 066 participants with a negative T0 
screen, 441 (2%) had been diagnosed with lung cancer at the time of the last available 
follow-up; the median follow-up time from T0 to diagnosis for these patients was 3·3 years 
(95% CI 3·0–3·6). In the first year after a negative T0 screen and before the scheduled T1 
screen, 17 (<1%) of 19 066 individuals were diagnosed with lung cancer (interval lung 
cancers). Additionally, 75 (<1%) individuals were diagnosed with lung cancer between the 
T1 and T2 screens (62 screen-detected and 13 interval cancers), 118 (1%) individuals had 
lung cancer detected at or within 1 year after the T2 screen (102 screen-detected and 16 
interval cancers), and 231 (1%) individuals were diagnosed during the follow-up phase of 
the trial (between 3 and 7 years after their prevalence screen). Lung cancer stage and 
histology by time of lung cancer detection is shown in table 2.
The yield of lung cancer at the T1 screen among participants with a negative T0 screen was 
0·34% (62 screen-detected cancers out of 18 121 screened participants), compared with a 
yield at the T0 screen among all eligible participants of 1·0% (267 of 26 231); the ratio of 
these yields is 0·34 (95% CI 0·26–0·43).
The median follow-up for all participants who had a T0 screen was 6·4 years (IQR 6·1–6·8) 
and for participants with a negative T0 screen it was 6·4 years (6·1–6·8). The overall 
incidence of lung cancer in participants with a negative T0 screen was lower than that for all 
participants who underwent a T0 screen (table 3). The overall incidence of lung cancer per 
100 000 person-years by screen result is shown in table 3 and the cumulative incidence of

 lung cancer according to screen result is shown in figure 2. The incidence rate of lung cancer 
after three negative screens (T0, T1, and T2), measured from the T2 screen to lung cancer 
diagnosis, death, or data cutoff, was reduced compared with that of all participants who had 
a T0 screen, measured from the T0 screen to lung cancer diagnosis, death, or data cutoff 
(rate ratio [RR] 0·36 [bootstrap 95% CI 0·31–0·42]), and compared with participants who 
had a negative T0 screen (0·64 [0·57–0·72]; table 3).
Overall survival and lung cancer-specific survival in participants with lung cancer diagnoses 
is shown in table 2. Cause of death in the mortality analysis is shown in the appendix. The 
mortality rate due to lung cancer during the trial was lower in participants with a negative T0 
screen compared with that in all participants who had a T0 screen (table 3). The mortality 
rate of lung cancer after three negative screens, measured from the T2 screen, was reduced 
compared with that of all participants who had a T0 screen, measured from the T0 screen 
(RR 0·49 [bootstrap 95% CI 0·40–0·59]), and when compared with participants who had a 
negative T0 screen (0·74 [0·62–0·85]).
In our hypothetical analysis, which assumes that if the T1 screen had not been done for any 
participants with a negative T0 screen, all such participants with a T1-screen-detected lung 
cancer (n=62) would have died of lung cancer, we found that not having a T1 scan would 
potentially increase the lung cancer mortality rate in the negative T0 screen group from 
185·82 (95% CI 162·17–211·93) per 100 000 person-years to 212·14 (186·80–239·96) per 
100 000 person-years. This result implies that an additional 28 participants would have died 
from lung cancer if the T1 scan was not done in the T0 negative group. This estimated 
hypothetical mortality rate is less than the lung cancer mortality rate in all participants who 
had a T0 screen (table 3). The comparison of risk of lung cancer diagnosis by screen result is 
shown in table 4.
Age, smoking history, emphysema on T0 screen, and a history of COPD were significant 
predictors of risk of lung cancer diagnosis in participants with a negative T0 screen and in 
all participants with a T0 screen; however, sex and race were not predictors of risk in either 
population (table 5). A family history of lung cancer was a significant predictor of risk of 
lung cancer diagnosis in all participants with a T0 screen, but not in the subgroup of 
participants with a negative T0 screen. Lung cancer-free survival according to risk group 
based on these risk predictors is shown in figure 3.
Discussion
The incidence of lung cancer in the group of high-risk participants enrolled in the NLST 
who had a negative low-dose CT prevalence screen was low in the year following this initial 
screen, relative to those with a positive low-dose CT prevalence screen, suggesting that 
annual screening after a negative screen might be unnecessary. Yearly screening for lung 
cancer has been proposed for decades as a method to improve patient outcomes, and the 
results from several screening trials show that low-dose CT screening in high-risk 
individuals increased detection of early-stage disease and reduced lung cancer 
mortality.2–6,16,17 These data have been met with much enthusiasm and will lead to changes

 in public policy, particularly since most treatment trials in lung cancer, even with targeted 
therapy, have shown only slight effects on progression-free survival.
However, screening is not without challenges and limitations. Some individuals will have 
unnecessary procedures with inherent complications and cost. Overdiagnosis and the need 
for continued surveillance are key issues.18 Additionally, low-dose CT screening has only 
been shown to be effective in individuals who fulfilled the NLST criteria, which represents 
an estimated 26% of all patients diagnosed with lung cancer;19 most cases of lung cancer 
would still be detected outside the high-risk screening programme, and no direct evidence 
shows how effective annual screening would be in other groups. Thus, the ultimate effect on 
lung cancer mortality in the best-case scenario, if every individual eligible for screening is 
enrolled, is estimated to be about a 5% overall reduction in lung cancer deaths.
Although this is a large number of averted deaths, advances are still needed in several 
problematic areas, including more accurate identification of the highest-risk individuals, a 
reduction in false-positive screen results, prediction of which tumours are aggressive and 
which are more indolent, and determination of the optimal appropriate screening interval to 
achieve the best possible balance of benefit versus harm. Ongoing assessment of the 
screening trial data continues to explore these issues in an attempt to understand and 
elucidate all of the risks and benefits, and to use prediction models to optimise imaging 
utilisation while reducing cost.
Whether our findings of a relatively low risk of lung cancer death in participants with no 
baseline T0 examination abnormalities are because participants with this screen result had 
very slow growing tumours (ie, a direct effect of indolent biological behaviour) or are due to 
a more indirect effect (eg, some participants might not have developed the same degree of 
tobacco-induced lung injury) cannot be clearly discerned from our results and is an area for 
future study.
One of the fundamental limitations of low-dose CT screening is the occurrence of false-
positive screen results. The number of individuals that require further assessment varies 
among screening trials, and typically depends on the criteria used to define a positive CT 
screen. In the NLST, about 25% of all low-dose CT group participants had an abnormality 
on their prevalence screen that required further assessment, although in the NELSON trial,4 
tumour volume and doubling times were effectively used to reduce the number of positive 
scans. However, any positive screen necessitates further assessment, potential invasive 
procedures, radiation, and cost. To address this issue, imaging improvements and peripheral 
specimen biomarkers have been suggested, which could be integrated into the diagnostic 
work-up.20 However, improving imaging and identifying effective biomarkers will not be 
simple, and much effort has been made to improve efficiency and eliminate unnecessary 
intervention.
Our retrospective analysis explored the incidence and mortality of lung cancer in the 73% of 
low-dose CT-screened participants who did not have an abnormality on their prevalence 
screen. We found that both the incidence and mortality of lung cancer over the course of the 
trial was significantly less in the T0 negative group than in those with a positive initial

 screen and significantly less than in all low-dose CT-screened participants combined. 
Moreover, the yield of screen-detected lung cancer at the T1 screen in the negative T0 group 
was reduced compared with the yield in all T0-screened participants.
Thus, the cost-effectiveness of annual low-dose CT is unclear in this T0 negative group 
when weighing the potential harms of more intense screening versus the potential benefit in 
averted lung cancer deaths. In the group of participants with three negative annual low-dose 
CT screens, the incidence and mortality was even less than that in the T0 negative group. 
These data not only question the necessity for annual screens following a negative 
prevalence screen, but also suggest that annual screens after subsequent negative low-dose 
CT screens might not be needed; no clear biological rationale underlies the selection of 
yearly examinations. In fact, several studies suggest it takes years for a lung cancer to 
develop,21 thus the risk of lung cancer in individuals with a negative screen would be low. 
Screening done at less frequent intervals could lead to a reduction in the number of CT 
assessments, radiation, and cost. However, some individuals might progress in the interval 
and be detected with more advanced-stage disease than they would have done if they had 
undergone yearly screening. In the worst-case scenario, not having a T1 screen could 
increase the lung cancer-specific mortality in the negative T0 screen group from 185 per 100 
000 person-years to 212 per 100 000 person-years, and the full benefit of screening would 
not be realised.
Risk prediction models will undoubtedly be useful in helping to optimise screening 
parameters, and in suggesting which individuals should have annual or less frequent 
assessments.12,13 Our current analysis found that clinical features including age, smoking 
history, history of COPD, and emphysema were associated with an increased risk for lung 
cancer. All of these features should be considered in the T0 negative population when 
developing future guidelines for screening programmes.
We do not present a detailed prediction model in this report, and any model developed solely 
from the controlled setting of the NLST would have to be regarded as preliminary, given the 
small number of lung cancer deaths in participants who had a negative T0 examination and a 
positive T1 examination. Evidence from a larger screened population that include these data 
and data from other screening programmes will be necessary to develop a fully validated 
prediction model that avoids overfitting a multivariable model and that is applicable 
worldwide. Additionally, our analysis did not directly test the effectiveness of biennial 
screening or screening at longer intervals, so assumptions were required and models will be 
needed to estimate the ultimate effect on outcomes. Data from ongoing mass screening 
programmes will be useful in determining the optimal duration and interval for lung cancer 
screening.
Annual low-dose CT screening detects some lung cancers at an earlier, more treatable stage 
than no screening at all or annual chest radiograph screening, and will improve outcomes for 
select patients. However, the magnitude of such an endeavour must be weighed against the 
risks and costs; resources are not unlimited and society should decide how to implement a 
responsible screening programme based on evidence-based data. In summary, the results of 
our retrospective analysis showed a significant reduction in the incidence of lung cancer and

 lung cancer-specific mortality of low-dose CT-screened participants with a negative 
prevalence screen, compared with those with a positive prevalence screen, and question the 
necessity of continuous annual low-dose CT screens for all eligible high-risk individuals. 
These findings will help inform the ongoing discussions about implementation of effective 
and efficient low-dose CT screening programmes.

 Research in context
Evidence before the study
We searched PubMed for all relevant articles published from Jan 1, 1995, to Dec 31, 
2015, on “Low-dose CT screening and lung cancer”, “Risk prediction for low-dose CT”, 
“Early detection of lung cancer with CT”, and “Biennial CT screening”, without 
language restrictions. Although we found several related studies about modelling of low-
dose CT to identify the highest-risk group and assess the necessity of annual screening, 
none reported data from a prospective randomised trial on the risk of lung cancer in 
participants with a negative initial screen or subsequent negative annual screen. 
Participants with negative screens are a large group of individuals that fulfil the eligibility 
criteria for screening, but who might not need to be screened every year.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the risk of lung cancer in National 
Lung Screening Trial participants who had a negative low-dose CT prevalence (initial) 
screen, and subsequent annual screens. Our findings suggest that individuals with a 
negative prevalence screen have a substantially decreased risk of lung cancer compared 
with those with a positive prevalence screen, and that annual screens might not be 
warranted in this group. These data will be important to inform ongoing decisions about 
optimising mass screening programmes in an effort to improve efficiency, while reducing 
radiation, cost, and morbidity.
Implications of all the available evidence
Future risk prediction and cost-effectiveness models can incorporate our data to optimise 
screening guidelines. Improving efficiency of low-dose CT screening for lung cancer 
could substantially reduce the number of annual screens required, which would have a 
meaningful impact on population-based screening programmes.
