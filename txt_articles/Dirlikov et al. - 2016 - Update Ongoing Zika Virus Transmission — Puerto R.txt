On April 29, 2016, this report was posted as an MMWR Early 
Release on the MMWR website (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr). 
Zika virus is a flavivirus transmitted primarily by Aedes 
species mosquitoes, and symptoms of infection can include 
rash, fever, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis (1).* Zika virus 
infection during pregnancy is a cause of microcephaly and 
other severe brain defects (2). Infection has also been associ-
ated with Guillain-Barré syndrome (3). In December 2015, 
Puerto Rico became the first U.S. jurisdiction to report local 
transmission of Zika virus, with the index patient report-
ing symptom onset on November 23, 2015 (4). This report 
provides an update to the epidemiology of and public health 
response to ongoing Zika virus transmission in Puerto 
Rico. During November 1, 2015–April 14, 2016, a total of 
6,157 specimens from suspected Zika virus–infected patients 
were evaluated by the Puerto Rico Department of Health 
(PRDH) and CDC Dengue Branch (which is located in San 
Juan, Puerto Rico), and 683 (11%) had laboratory evidence 
of current or recent Zika virus infection by one or more tests: 
reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or 
immunoglobulin M (IgM) enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA). Zika virus–infected patients resided in 50 
(64%) of 78 municipalities in Puerto Rico. Median age was 
34 years (range = 35 days–89 years). The most frequently 
reported signs and symptoms were rash (74%), myalgia 
(68%), headache (63%), fever (63%), and arthralgia (63%). 
There were 65 (10%) symptomatic pregnant women who 
tested positive by RT-PCR or IgM ELISA. A total of 17 (2%) 
patients required hospitalization, including 5 (1%) patients 
with suspected Guillain-Barré syndrome. One (<1%) patient 
died after developing severe thrombocytopenia. The public 
health response to the outbreak has included increased labora-
tory capacity to test for Zika virus infection (including blood 
donor screening), implementation of enhanced surveillance 
systems, and prevention activities focused on pregnant women. 
Vector control activities include indoor and outdoor residual 
spraying and reduction of mosquito breeding environments 
focused around pregnant women’s homes. Residents of and 
travelers to Puerto Rico should continue to employ mosquito 
bite avoidance behaviors, take precautions to reduce the risk 
for sexual transmission (5), and seek medical care for any acute 
illness with rash or fever.
Epidemiologic Surveillance
In response to the introduction of Zika virus, PRDH and 
CDC Dengue Branch incorporated Zika virus case reporting 
and diagnostic testing into existing dengue and chikungunya 
virus surveillance systems and developed a laboratory-based 
Passive Arboviral Diseases Surveillance System.† Health 
providers submit serum specimens to PRDH from patients 
with a clinical suspicion of Zika, chikungunya, or dengue 
virus infection using a case report form.§ Depending on 
the number of days between onset of illness and specimen 
collection, specimens are tested for the three arboviruses by 
a Trioplex RT-PCR assay, for evidence of Zika and dengue 
virus infection by IgM ELISA, or by both assays (4).¶ Zika 
virus–infected patients were defined by positive results from 
either RT-PCR (confirmed) or IgM ELISA with negative 
dengue virus IgM ELISA (presumptive positive). Zika virus 
testing has been incorporated into the Sentinel Enhanced 
Dengue Surveillance System, which tests specimens from all 
febrile patients treated at either one outpatient clinic or one 
hospital emergency department in Ponce. Tissue and blood 
specimens collected during autopsy from patients who died 
after an acute febrile illness are tested for Zika virus infection 
through the Enhanced Fatal Acute Febrile Illness Surveillance 
System.** Following CDC interim guidance (6), symptomatic 
pregnant women are tested using the diagnostic algorithm, 
and asymptomatic pregnant women are tested for evidence 
of Zika and dengue virus infection by IgM ELISA. Initiated 
in February 2016, the Guillain-Barré syndrome Passive 
Surveillance System allows health providers from across the

island to report clinically suspected Guillain-Barré syndrome 
cases by sending a case report form and serum specimen to 
PRDH.†† Specimens from patients with suspected Guillain-
Barré syndrome are tested by both RT-PCR and IgM ELISA 
for all three arboviruses. Diagnostic test results are managed 
through an integrated data management system. Results are 
reported to providers, and aggregate data are available online 
in a weekly arboviral report.§§
During November 1, 2015–April 14, 2016, specimens from 
6,157 suspected arbovirus-infected patients were evaluated and 
683 (11%) were either laboratory-confirmed or presumptive 
positive for Zika virus infection (Table). Of these 683 Zika 
virus laboratory confirmed or presumptive patients, 581 (85%) 
were confirmed by RT-PCR, 73 (11%) were presumptive 
positive by IgM ELISA, and 29 (4%) were positive by both 
RT-PCR and IgM ELISA. Dengue, chikungunya, or unspeci-
fied flavivirus infection was identified in 110 (2%), 61 (1%), 
and 32 (<1%) suspected arbovirus-infected patients, respec-
tively. No patients with evidence of coinfection with Zika, 
dengue, or chikungunya viruses were identified by RT-PCR. 
Of all identified Zika virus–infected patients, 646 (95%) were 
reported to the Passive Arboviral Diseases Surveillance System. 
Thirty-two (5%) Zika virus–infected patients were reported 
through the Sentinel Enhanced Dengue Surveillance System. 
Five (1%) suspected cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome reported 
to the Guillain-Barré syndrome Passive Surveillance System 
were presumptive positive for Zika virus infection, and two 
had unspecified flavivirus infection.
Weekly Zika virus disease case counts gradually increased 
since late November 2015, whereas incidence of dengue and 
chikungunya cases remained comparatively low (Figure 1). Zika 
virus–infected patients were reported from 50 (64%) of the 
78 total municipalities (Figure 2); 146 (21%) patients were 
residents of the San Juan metropolitan area. Among all iden-
tified Zika virus–infected patients, 436 (64%) were female, 
and median age was 34 years (range = 35 days–89 years). 
The most frequently reported signs and symptoms were 
rash (74%), myalgia (68%), headache (63%), fever (63%), 
and arthralgia (63%). Thrombocytopenia (defined as blood 
platelets levels <100,000 cells/mm3) was reported in nine 
(1%) cases. Sixty-five (10%) symptomatic pregnant women 
were Zika virus–infected patients. Seventeen (2%) patients 
required hospitalization, including five (1%) suspected 
Guillain-Barré syndrome cases. In one (<1%) identified 
Zika virus–associated case, the patient died of complications 
related to severe thrombocytopenia.
To ensure the safety of the blood supply, Puerto Rico imported 
all blood products from the United States during March 5–
April 14 (7). On April 2, blood collection resumed with donor 
screening using a Food and Drug Administration–approved Zika 
virus investigational nucleic acid detection test (Roche Molecular 
Systems, Inc., Pleasanton, California). Emergency blood 
imports ended on April 15. During April 2–14, nine (<1%) of 
1,910 screened donated blood units had positive test results. 
These units were removed from the blood supply, and testing is 
pending to confirm presumptive Zika virus infection.
Public Health Response
Through the Zika Active Pregnancy Surveillance System, 
Zika virus–infected pregnant women and their offspring are 
monitored for adverse maternal, fetal, neonatal, infant, and 
child health outcomes.¶¶ Surviving offspring across the island 
will be referred to the Children with Special Health Care Needs 
program for developmental surveillance and coordination of spe-
cialized services, as needed, up to age 3 years. The Birth Defects 
Surveillance System*** will identify newborns with congenital

microcephaly, including those born to women infected with Zika 
virus during pregnancy, and refer all cases to Avanzando Juntos, 
Puerto Rico’s Early Intervention Services System. 
With CDC’s assistance, PRDH has also implemented com-
prehensive strategies to prevent Zika virus transmission. Health 
messaging, including posters and electronic monitors, have been 
implemented and health education materials are available at vari-
ous locations, including health care facilities and ports of entry. 
Community intervention strategies have focused on pregnant 
women. PRDH has worked closely with Women, Infants, and 
Children (WIC) clinics, where 90% of Puerto Rican pregnant 
women received services in 2015 (Dana Miró Medina, WIC 
Puerto Rico, personal communication, 2016). As of April 13, 
a total of 13,351 pregnant women participated in Zika virus 
educational orientations offered by WIC clinics. PRDH and 
the CDC Foundation financed the purchase and delivery of 
Zika Prevention Kits, which include locally adapted health 
information, mosquito repellent, a bed net, larvicidal tablets 
(tablets placed in water sources where mosquitoes might breed 
that prevent larvae from maturating into adults), and condoms. 
In addition, to reduce the risk for unintended pregnancies 
with adverse fetal outcomes related to Zika virus infection, the 
response includes increasing the availability of contraceptives (8).
During February–March, an insecticide resistance study 
of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes was conducted to develop vector 
control strategies, such as truck-mounted, ultra-low volume 
spraying and indoor and outdoor residual spraying. Mosquitoes 
from across Puerto Rico were tested using the CDC bottle bio-
assay to determine insecticide susceptibility, particularly against 
pyrethroids. Results indicated a high degree of geographical 
variation with respect to susceptibility to insecticides, and 
deltamethrin was identified as the most suitable pyrethroid 
candidate for use in vector control programs (data not shown). 
Insecticide susceptibility surveillance is ongoing.
A home-based vector control program focused on pregnant 
women is underway. Women are contacted through WIC 
clinics, and are offered source reduction services (e.g., removal 
of water containers that can serve as mosquito breeding sites), 
larvicide application, and indoor and outdoor residual spraying 
using deltamethrin. PRDH and CDC have collaborated with 
the Puerto Rico Department of Housing to incorporate these 
services into its vector control activities.
Discussion
Zika virus remains a public health challenge in Puerto Rico, and 
cases are expected to continue to occur throughout 2016. Building 
upon existing dengue and chikungunya virus surveillance systems, 
PRDH collaborated with CDC to establish a comprehensive sur-
veillance system to characterize the incidence and epidemiology 
of Zika virus disease on the island. Expanded laboratory capacity 
and surveillance provided timely availability of data, allowing for 
continuous analysis and adapted public health response. Following 
CDC guidelines, both symptomatic and asymptomatic pregnant 
women are tested for evidence of Zika virus infection. Information 
from the Zika Active Pregnancy Surveillance System will be used 
to raise awareness about the complications associated with Zika 
virus during pregnancy, encourage prevention through use of 
mosquito repellent and other methods, and inform health care 
providers of the additional care needed by women infected with 
Zika virus during pregnancy, as well as congenitally exposed fetuses 
and children. In addition, the prevalence of adverse fetal outcomes 
documented through this system can be compared with baseline 
rates as further evidence of associations between Zika virus infec-
tions and adverse outcomes, such as microcephaly (2).
The finding that women constitute the majority of cases 
might be attributable to targeted outreach and testing. The 
most common symptoms among Zika virus disease cases 
were rash, myalgia, headache, fever, and arthralgia, which are 
similar to the most common signs and symptoms reported 
elsewhere in the Americas (9). Although Zika virus–associated 
deaths are rare (10), the first identified death in Puerto Rico 
highlights the possibility of severe cases, as well as the need for 
continued outreach to raise health care providers’ awareness 
of complications that might lead to severe disease or death. 
To ensure continued blood safety, blood collection resumed 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Zika virus transmission in Puerto Rico has been ongoing, with 
the first patient reporting symptom onset in November 2015. 
Zika virus infection is a cause of microcephaly and other severe 
birth defects. Zika virus infection has also been associated with 
Guillain-Barré syndrome.
What is added by this report?
During November 1, 2015–April 14, 2016, a total of 
6,157 specimens from suspected Zika virus–infected patients 
from Puerto Rico were evaluated and 683 (11%) had laboratory 
evidence of current or recent Zika virus infection. The public 
health response includes increased capacity to test for Zika virus, 
preventing infection in pregnant women, monitoring infected 
pregnant women and their fetus for adverse outcomes, control-
ling mosquitos, and assuring the safety of blood products.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Residents of and travelers to Puerto Rico should continue to 
employ mosquito bite avoidance behaviors, take precautions to 
reduce the risk for sexual transmission, and seek medical care 
for any acute illness with rash or fever. Clinicians who suspect 
Zika virus disease in patients who reside in or have recently 
returned from areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission 
should report cases to public health officials.

with a donor screening program for Zika virus infection, and 
all units screened positive are removed.
Residents of and travelers to Puerto Rico should continue 
to employ mosquito bite avoidance behaviors, including using 
mosquito repellents, wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants, and 
ensuring homes are properly enclosed (e.g., screening windows 
and doors, closing windows, and using air conditioning) to 
avoid bites while indoors.††† To reduce the risk for sexual trans-
mission, especially to pregnant women, precautions should 
include consistent and proper use of condoms or abstinence 
(5). Such measures can also help avoid unintended pregnancies 
and minimize risk for fetal Zika virus infection (6). Clinicians 
who suspect Zika virus disease in patients who reside in or have 
recently returned from areas with ongoing Zika virus transmis-
sion should report cases to public health officials.
