SUMMARY
The mechanisms underlying Zika virus (ZIKV)-related
microcephaly and other neurodevelopment defects
remain poorly understood. Here, we describe the
derivation and characterization, including single-
cell RNA-seq, of neocortical and spinal cord neuroe-
pithelial stem (NES) cells to model early human
neurodevelopment and ZIKV-related neuropatho-
genesis. By analyzing human NES cells, organotypic
fetal brain slices, and a ZIKV-infected micrencephalic
brain, we show that ZIKV infects both neocortical and
spinal NES cells as well as their fetal homolog, radial
glial cells (RGCs), causing disrupted mitoses, super-
numerary centrosomes, structural disorganization,
and cell death. ZIKV infection of NES cells and
RGCs causes centrosomal depletion and mitochon-
drial sequestration of phospho-TBK1 during mitosis.
We also found that nucleoside analogs inhibit ZIKV
replication in NES cells, protecting them from ZIKV-
induced pTBK1 relocalization and cell death. We es-
tablished a model system of human neural stem cells
to reveal cellular and molecular mechanisms under-
lying neurodevelopmental defects associated with
ZIKV infection and its potential treatment.
INTRODUCTION
The human CNS is a complex organ that, as a result of its
extended development, is susceptible to a host of genetic and
environmental insults. Although great strides have been made
in mapping the genetic landscape of human neurodevelopmen-
tal malformations, understanding of the mechanisms by which
diverse environmental pathogens affect human neurodevelop-
ment has been lagging (Bae et al., 2015; Diaz and Gleeson,
2009; Lui et al., 2011; Silbereis et al., 2016; Woods, 2004).
The emerging link between the mosquito-borne flavivirus Zika
virus (ZIKV) infection of pregnant women and fetal microcephaly
reinforces the need to use tissue- and species-relevant cellular
systems to study human CNS development and establish exper-
imental systems for modeling ZIKV infection, neurotropism, and
treatment (Miner and Diamond, 2016; Schuler-Faccini et al.,
2016). In adults, rare complications of ZIKV infection include
Guillain-Barre
´ syndrome (Broutet et al., 2016; Oehler et al.,
2014) and meningoencephalitis (Araujo et al., 2016). More prom-
inently, ZIKV infection during pregnancy is associated with, and
likely causative for, severe fetal abnormalities including micro-
cephaly/micrencephaly, lissencephaly, hydrocephaly, necrosis,
periventricular and cortical calcifications, diffuse astrogliosis,
hypoplasia of the brain stem and spinal cord (SC), Wallerian
degeneration of the corticospinal tract, and ocular abnormalities
(Brasil et al., 2016; Mlakar et al., 2016; de Paula Freitas et al.,
2016; Rubin et al., 2016). More broadly, the classical teratogenic

 TORCH syndrome pathogens (toxoplasma, other agents, rubella
virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus) result in up to
half of all perinatal deaths around the world, many associated
with brain malformations including microcephaly, with an espe-
cially large burden in developing countries (Adams Waldorf and
McAdams, 2013; Fine and Arndt, 1985).
Primary microcephaly results mainly from the depletion of neu-
ral stem/progenitor cells due to centrosomal defects, premature
differentiation, and/or cell death (Diaz and Gleeson, 2009;
Woods, 2004). Recently, ZIKV was shown to preferentially infect
human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neural progenitors
and organoids and cause mitotic impairment and cell death in
ZIKV mouse models (Dang et al., 2016; Garcez et al., 2016;
Qian et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2016; Lazear et al., 2016; Li et al.,
2016; Cugola et al., 2016; Miner et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016).
However, the human CNS is distinct in the diversity and prolifer-
ative potential of neural stem and progenitor cells (Lui et al.,
2011; Bae et al., 2015; Silbereis et al., 2016; Gage and Temple,
2013). As a result, there may be aspects of viral infection that
are unique to the human brain. Moreover, there have been only
limited reports to date on human cell-type-specific responses
to ZIKV over the course of infection primarily in in vitro or murine
model systems without comparison to infected human brain tis-
sue. Finally, it is not known to what extent microcephaly results
from direct ZIKV infection of developing neural cells versus indi-
rect effects, such as inflammation and altered placental support,
which has been shown to affect brain development (Burton and
Fowden, 2015; Mor, 2016). Addressing these questions in the
context of the developing human CNS is crucial for deciphering
ZIKV tropism and neuropathogenesis.
Here, we describe the derivation and characterization of
neocortical (NCX) and SC neuroepithelial stem (NES) cells as
in vitro models for neural stem/progenitor cells, early human neu-
rodevelopment, and ZIKV-related neuropathogenesis. NES cell
lines are derived from primary neuroepithelial cells, the earliest
population of resident neural stem cells present during neurode-
velopment, when the neural tube is comprised of a pseudostra-
tified neuroepithelium lining the central cavity (Bae et al., 2015).
These cells constitute the ventricular zone (VZ) of the neural
tube and serve as the stem cells of the CNS. Initially, neuroepi-
thelial cells divide symmetrically in order to expand the stem
cell pool (Silbereis et al., 2016). Later on, neuroepithelial cells
transition into radial glia cells (RGCs), which reside in the VZ
and inner (iSVZ) and outer subventricular zone (oSVZ). These
cell populations serve as the stem or progenitor cells for neurons
and macroglia (i.e., astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) and pro-
vide scaffolding for migrating nascent neurons (Bae et al.,
2015). RGCs largely divide asymmetrically, giving rise to a
daughter RGC, an intermediate progenitor cell (IPC), or a
nascent neuron that subsequently migrates. Because of the abil-
ity to self-renew and differentiate, neuroepithelial cells are ideal
candidates for the study of neural stem cell biology and various
developmental diseases.
By comparing NES cells, organotypic fetal brain slices, and the
postmortem human tissue in the context of ZIKV infection, we
show that ZIKV infects both NCX- and SC-NES cells and their
fetal homolog, RGCs in the VZ and SVZ, and to a lesser extent,
postmigratory neurons in the cortical plate (CP; anlage of the ce-
rebral cortical layers 2–6). ZIKV infection is associated with
mitotic impairment, structural disorganization of the proliferative
zones, and increased cell death of NES cells and RGCs. We also
found that ZIKV causes subcellular relocation of the phosphory-
lated TANK binding kinase 1 (pTBK1), a pivotal player in antiviral
innate immunity and cell proliferation (Farlik et al., 2012; Helga-
son et al., 2013; Pillai et al., 2015; Thurston et al., 2009) from cen-
trosomes to mitochondria during mitosis of NES cells and RGCs.
Antiviral nucleoside analogs, including the FDA-approved drug
Sofosbuvir, inhibit ZIKV replication and ZIKV-induced cytopa-
thology, including the relocalization of pTBK1 to mitochondria,
in NES cells. Together, these results validate the use of this
NES cell system as an experimental model for studying early hu-
man neurodevelopment and ZIKV-induced pathogenesis, pro-
vide a testable hypothesis for the mechanism of ZIKV-induced
cytopathology, and lay the groundwork for future research on
ZIKV-related neurodevelopmental defects and therapy.
RESULTS
Derivation of Human Neocortical and Spinal Cord
Neuroepithelial Stem Cells
Different early human neural stem/progenitor cell types, in-
cluding neuroepithelial-like cells, have been derived from hPSCs
and the developing human brain (Conti and Cattaneo, 2010;
Edri et al., 2015; Elkabetz et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2008, Tailor
et al., 2013). However, stable cell lines of neuroepithelial cells
have not been derived from the dorsal forebrain (prospective
NCX) or the SC. Thus, we attempted to generate stable long-
term, self-renewing populations of NCX and SC neuroepithelial
cells from ten human specimens ranging from 5 to 8 postcon-
ceptional weeks (pcw; Carnegie stage 15–17) (Figure 1A and
Table S1).
Dissociated cells were plated and examined for the presence
of neural rosettes reminiscent of the radial arrangement and
apico-basal polarization established by neuroepithelial cells in
the native neural tube (Figure 1B). In total, we derived and char-
acterized five stable NCX and three stable SC neuroepithelial
cell lines. Moreover, after propagation in the presence of the
growth factors FGF2 and EGF as well as BDNF (Figures S1A
and S1J), the neuroepithelial cell lines exhibited stem/progenitor
cell characteristics and retained a high neurogenic capacity;
thus, we termed them NCX- and SC-NES cells, respectively.
Both NCX- and SC-NES cells were immunopositive for the neu-
roepithelial marker SOX1 and the pan-neural stem cell markers
nestin, SOX2, and vimentin (VIM) (Figures 1C, 1D, S1B, and
S1K). Metaphase NES cells were also observed and labeled
with the anti-phospho-VIM antibody, and some displayed a
typical basal process (Figure S1C).
Next, we investigated whether NES cells retained regional
identity after long-term expansion. NCX-NES cells expressed
FOXG1 and OTX2 (Figures 1E and S1D), key transcription factors
demarcating proliferative zones of the early human forebrain
(Onorati et al., 2014). On the other hand, SC-NES cells were pos-
itive for the caudal regional marker HOXB4 (Krumlauf et al., 1993)
(Figure S1L), thus demonstrating maintenance of regional iden-
tity even after more than ten passages. These cell lines have

 been expanded for more than 1 year and 35 passages with no
evidence of chromosomal instability (Figures S1E and S1M).
To test the neurogenic potential of NES cells, we used an opti-
mized differentiation protocol (Figure S1F). All NES cells gave
rise to MAP2+ and TUBB3+ neurons and extended neurites (Fig-
ures S1G and S1H). We found that NCX-NES cells differentiated
into neurons positive for BCL11B (also known as CTIP2), a
marker of deep-layer excitatory projection neurons in the NCX
(Figure S1H). SC-NES cells also gave rise to TUBB3-, MAP2-,
and RBFOX3 (also known as NeuN)-positive neurons, whereas
some exhibited a cholinergic phenotype, as expected for a SC
neuronal population (Figures S1N and S1O). Furthermore,
GFAP+ astroglial cells (Figures S1I and S1P) and occasional
O4+ oligodendrocytes were detected (Figure S1Q), thus demon-
strating the multipotential stem cell capacity of NES cells.
Human NES Cells Exhibit the Transcriptional Signature
of Early Neural Stem Cells
To further characterize NCX-NES cells, we conducted single-cell
RNA-seq on 439 expanded NCX-NES cells and 383 cells from
5–6 and 8 pcw donor-matched NCX (Tables S1 and S2); 362
and 255 cells, respectively, passed our quality-control pipeline
(Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The majority of cells
analyzed from the donor-matched NCX tissue samples ex-
pressed canonical marker genes for neuroepithelial cells and
RGCs of the dorsal forebrain (Figure 1F). NCX-NES cells showed
similar expression profiles as their donor-matched NCX cells
(Figure 1F). Neither brain NCX cells nor NCX-NES cells ex-
pressed ventral forebrain markers (Figures 1G and S2D).
To place the transcriptional profiles of NCX-NES cells within
the context of fetal development, we supplemented our donor-
matched datasets with single-cell RNA-seq data from 526 cells
collected from fetal NCX at 16, 19, and 20 pcw (Figure 1H);
392 of them passed quality control. We conducted principal
component analysis for dimension reduction with genes as ob-
servations and single cells as variables (Figure S2A). The first
principal component was used as the representation of each
fetal time point or NCX-NES cell line. Pairwise Pearson’s corre-
lation test showed that NCX-NES cells highly correlated with
embryonic development time points (r > 0.8; Figure S2B). We
next applied a clustering algorithm designed for single-cell
studies, SNN-Cliq, to explore cellular composition over neocor-
tical development and in NCX-NES cells. Based on the expres-
sion of marker genes for various cell types, we identified five
NCX clusters (Figure S2C) representing ventricular and outer
RGCs (vRGCs and oRGCs, respectively), two types of IPCs,
and early neurons (Figure 1I). As expected from the expression
profiles of NCX-NES cells, the largest of the three NCX-NES
cell clusters highly correlated with the vRGC and IPC clusters,
while the other two NCX-NES cell clusters showed neuroproge-
nitor-like gene expression profiles (Figure S2D). Together, these
data establish NES cell lines as relevant models of early human
CNS development.
Human NES Cells, but Not NES-Derived Neurons, Can Be
Efficiently Infected by ZIKV
We sought to test whether the NCX-NES cell system can be used
as a model for ZIKV infection. First, we infected NCX-NES cells
with the 2010 Cambodian ZIKV strain FSS 13025 (MOI = 0.1),
which shares 98% nucleotide identity with the current Brazilian
epidemic strain. We monitored NCX-NES cells up to 6.5 days
post-infection (DPI). At 3.5 DPI, we observed widespread ZIKV
infection, as demonstrated by immunolabeling for the viral
nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), with over 90% of NCX-NES cells
infected (Figures S3A and S4F). We also observed a significant
decrease in cell density over time compared to mock-infected
cells (Figure S3B). Notably, the number of active caspase 3
(aCASP3+) apoptotic cells as well as pyknotic cells (i.e., cells
showing condensation of the chromatin) was significantly higher
in the infected group at 3.5 and 6.5 DPI compared to mock con-
trol (Figures S3C and S3D). Based on the analysis of immunolab-
eling for MKI67 (also known as Ki-67), a static marker of prolifer-
ative activity, we found that the proliferation levels were also
significantly decreased by 3.5 DPI, with a continued decline
through 6.5 DPI (Figures S3E and S3F). Electron microscopy
also showed viral particles in infected NCX-NES cells and signs
of nuclear fragmentation compared to mock cells (Figures 1J
and 1K).
Recent studies have shown that hPSC-derived and mouse
neural progenitors and neurons are infected by ZIKV, though
neural stem and progenitor cells are preferential targets of infec-
tion (Qian et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2016). To test this in our model
system, ZIKV was used to infect NCX-NES cells after differenti-
ating them into neurons for 48 days. At 3.5 DPI, no obvious in-
crease in the cytopathic effect or cell death was evident in the
ZIKV-treated cultures (Figures S4A and S4B). In order to discrim-
inate between ZIKV infection of neurons, which are postmitotic
and express high levels of MAP2, and progenitors, we adminis-
tered 5-bromo-20-deoxyuridine (BrdU), a thymidine analog that
incorporates into newly synthesized DNA, before ZIKV infection
(Figure S4C). We found that only �7.2% of the cells in the
neuronal cultures were NS1+ (Figures S4D, S4E, and S4F).
Among the NS1+ neurons, 46% were BrdU�, thus indicating
that only �3.3% of postmitotic neurons were infected by ZIKV
(Figures S4G, S4H, and S4I). Therefore, the ability of ZIKV to
infect neurons is extremely low in comparison to its ability to
infect self-renewing NES cells (�90%, Figure S4F). This result
also suggests that some NES cells infected during mitosis could
have passed the infection onto daughter cells destined to
become neurons.
ZIKV Preferentially Infects RGCs, Causing Scaffold
Disorganization in Fetal Organotypic Slices
In addition to NES cells, we also infected ex vivo human organo-
typic fetal brain slices with ZIKV strain FSS 13025 (Figure 2A
and Table S3). Before infection, brain slice cultures showed
completely normal anatomical structures of the developing
NCX, including an intact VZ/SVZ, intermediate zone/subplate
(IZ/SP) and CP, with a prominent RG scaffold (Figure 2B). At
1.5 DPI, only a few cells were infected, and nearly all infected
cells resided in the VZ/SVZ (Figure 2C); no obvious anatomical
or cellular defects were otherwise observed. Interestingly, we
did not observe any postmigratory neurons in the CP that
were NS1+ at 1.5 DPI (Figure 2C). A dramatic increase in the
number of NS1+ cells was evident at 3.5 and 6.5 DPI, mostly
located in the VZ, SVZ, and IZ/SP (Figures 2F and 2G). A majority
Cell Reports 16, 2576–2592, September 6, 2016

 of NS1-expressing cells also stained positive for the RGC marker
VIM (Figures 2C, 2F, and 2G). Immunostaining of VIM showed
that the RG scaffold was disorganized and that the radial organi-
zation of neurons in the CP was altered adjacent to highly in-
fected regions of brain slices as compared to less infected re-
gions or uninfected control (Figures 2D, 2E, 2F, and 2G). By
6.5 DPI, architectural disorganization was even more pro-
nounced, with non-infected VIM+ RGCs acquiring a ‘‘balloon’’
shape, suggesting an indirect, non-cell-autonomous effect of
ZIKV-infected cells (Figures 2F and 2G).
To test whether ZIKV-induced effects are virus strain specific,
we tested the neurotropism of a Brazilian ZIKV strain, PE243, on
NES cells, revealing an extensive NS1-positivity at 3.5 DPI (Fig-
ure S5A), which was not present in mock-infected cells or cells
exposed to UV- or low pH-inactivated ZIKV particles. ZIKV
PE243 also infected a neural primary culture from a 15 pcw
NCX tissue, with a widespread NS1+ signal (Figure S5B). ZIKV
PE243-infected organotypic brain slices also exhibited an
architectural disorganization of the RG scaffold at 3.5 DPI.
(Figure S5C).
Neocortical RGCs Contain ZIKV in an Infected Human
Microcephalic Fetus
To confirm that ZIKV infection of RGCs is linked with micro-
cephaly/micrencephaly, we examined postmortem forebrain
and SC tissues of the first reported ZIKV-infected microcephalic
fetus (approximately 30 pcw, Table S4) from a ZIKV-infected
mother (Mlakar et al., 2016) (Figure 3A). ZIKV RNA was previ-
ously found in the brain tissue of this fetus by RT-PCR (Mlakar
et al., 2016). Tissue sections of the forebrain were immunoposi-
tive for NS1 and the ZIKV envelope (E) glycoprotein in the
neocortical VZ and SVZ RGCs (Figures 3B–3E), which were iden-
tified by their position, morphology and the expression of VIM
(Figures 3G and 3I). Regions of the neocortical VZ/SVZ and RG
morphology in those regions were disorganized in the infected
brain, with numerous ventricular protrusions and a visually
apparent decrease in the density of basal processes from
RGCs as compared to an age-matched postmortem control
(Figures 3F and 3H). RGCs also clustered abnormally in the
VZ/SVZ, and the RG scaffold was disorganized, particularly in
aCASP3+ cells, as indicated by nestin or VIM staining (Figures
3I, 3L, and 3M). Neurons in the NCX appeared disorganized
and dysplastic, which could be due to either direct infection by
ZIKV or indirectly through altered migration and neuron place-
ment resulting from disruptions to the RG scaffold (Figure 3J).
We did not observe infected cells in the ependymal layer, deriv-
atives of RGCs lining the central canal of the SC (Figure 3K).
NES Cells and RGCs Express the Putative ZIKV Entry
Receptors AXL and TYRO3
To better understand why ZIKV preferentially infects neural stem
cells and RGCs, we surveyed the expression of putative ZIKV en-
try receptors in the NCX-NES cells and human fetal brain. Recent
studies suggested that a number of cell-surface proteins may
serve as ZIKV entry factors, including AXL, TYRO3, CD209,
HAVCR1, and TIMD4, with AXL being the most plausible candi-
date (Hamel et al., 2015; Nowakowski et al., 2016). Among these
five putative receptors, single-cell RNA-seq analysis found that
AXL was generally expressed at the highest and most consistent
levels in NCX-NES cells and RGCs and IPCs from the developing
NCX (Figure 4A), whereas TYRO3 was expressed inconsistently
and other receptors were essentially not expressed by NES cells,
RGCs, and IPCs (Figures 4A and S2D). Analysis of previously
published adult single-cell sequencing data (Darmanis et al.,
2015) indicated that AXL was highly expressed in adult astro-
cytes, microglia, and endothelial cells but not in neurons (Figures
4B and S6A). Analysis of tissue-level transcriptome data from the
developing human brain (Kang et al., 2011) showed that both
AXL and TYRO3 expression in the NCX have bimodal patterns,
with high expression in embryonic and early fetal samples and
again increased expression beginning during late fetal develop-
ment that remains at elevated levels after birth until adulthood
(Figures 4C and 4D), which was consistent with the pattern of
astrocyte generation (Zhang et al., 2016).
We corroborated the transcriptional data through immunoflu-
orescence analysis of AXL protein expression and found co-
expression of AXL and VIM in NCX-NES cells (Figures 4E and
4F). AXL expression in 14 pcw NCX was detected in VZ and
VIM+ RGC basal processes as well as in blood vessels (Fig-
ure 4G). AXL was highly expressed in the VZ/SVZ but not the
CP of fetal organotypic slice cultures (Figure 4H). Interestingly,
NS1 staining was close to AXL staining in infected organotypic
slices (Figure 4H). AXL signal was scarcely detectable in adult
neocortical astrocytes, restricted to their end-feet contacting
blood vessels, and in the periventricular astrocyte ribbon (Fig-
ure 4I). Taken together, these observations support AXL and
possibly TYRO3 as viral entry factors and may explain the cell-
type specificity of ZIKV infection in NES cells and RGCs (Nowa-
kowski et al., 2016).
ZIKV Infection Redirects pTBK1 from Cytoplasm and
Centrosomes to Mitochondria during Mitosis
Recent work reported that ZIKV disrupts mitosis and increases
cell death in neural stem cells (Garcez et al., 2016; Qian et al.,
2016), although the molecular basis of these effects is unknown.
TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is a cellular serine-threonine ki-
nase that is essential for both innate antiviral immune signaling
and for cell proliferation as well as other processes (Farlik
et al., 2012; Helgason et al., 2013; Pillai et al., 2015; Thurston
et al., 2009). We hypothesized that ZIKV could disrupt NES cell
proliferation by diverting TBK1 activity away from mitosis and to-
ward innate immune signaling. By using single-cell RNA-seq
data, we found that TBK1 was highly expressed in both NES cells
and RGCs/IPCs in the fetal NCX but not in immature neurons
(Figure 5A). Single-cell RNA-seq data also showed that TBK1
is highly expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in the
adult brain (Figure 5A). Consistent with this expression, analysis
of a developing human brain transcriptome dataset (Kang et al.,
2011) revealed a bimodal pattern of TBK1 expression in the NCX,
with high expression in the embryonic and early fetal samples
and again during postnatal development (Figure S6B).
To investigate whether TBK1 levels changed during ZIKV
infection, we conducted droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) on both
ZIKV-infected and mock-infected NES cells and organotypic
brain slices. No differences in TBK1 levels were found between
uninfected and ZIKV-infected (with either the Cambodian or

expression of TBK1 in the relatively homogeneous NES cell pop-
ulation was greater than in the organotypic brain slices, which
are composed of both neural stem/progenitor cells and imma-
ture postmitotic neurons (Figure 5B). This indicates that ZIKV
infection does not lead to obvious changes in TBK1 mRNA
respectively; total number of infected cells = 456 at 3.5 DPI and 1,315 at 6.5 DPI). At 6.5 DPI, CP was significantly less infected than the other zones of the NCX
(paired two-tailed t test, p < 0.01). Regions with high numbers of infected cells (shown in between arrowheads) show a more pronounced defect in radial
orientation of RG fibers. Furthermore, it is possible to observe balloon-like cells that express VIM.

 expression in our two model systems. We therefore surveyed
protein expression by immunoblotting for TBK1 and phosphory-
lated TBK1 (pTBK1) on human tissue from fetal VZ/SVZ and CP
and found that there was a higher level of pTBK1 in VZ/SVZ
compared to CP (Figure 5C). Furthermore, immunofluorescence
analysis revealed that phospho-VIM+ mitotic NES cells co-ex-
pressed pTBK1 in centrosomes and midbody (Figure 5D).
Consistent with this, pTBK1+ cells co-expressed PAX6 in the
VZ/oSVZ of the fetal neocortical wall (Figure 5D). Together, these
results suggest that ZIKV affects the localization or activity of
TBK1 without substantially altering TBK1 expression.
We therefore examined the localization of pTBK1 in NCX-NES
cells and organotypic slices during ZIKV infection. We found that
pTBK1 localized to the centrosomes in NCX-NES cells and
RGCs of organotypic brain slices, as demonstrated by co-stain-
ing of pTBK1 and TUBG (also known as g-tubulin) (Figures 5E,
5G, 5K, and 5M). In contrast, pTBK1 was no longer detected in
centrosomes in ZIKV-infected cells but was instead localized
to mitochondria, as shown by colocalization with ATP5A1 (Fig-
ures 5F, 5H, 5L, 5N, and 5O). Relocalization of pTBK1 to mito-
chondria in ZIKV-infected NES cells was confirmed by immunoe-
lectron microscopy (Figures 5I and 5J). ZIKV-infected cells also
exhibited disrupted mitotic progression, including an increase
in the number of NES cells and RGCs containing more than
two centrosomes (Figures 5H, 5N, and 5P). Mitochondrial shape
also appeared different, as shown by electron microscopy,
with increased mitochondrial area in ZIKV-infected NES cells,
whereas mitochondrial density was unchanged (Figure 5Q).
TBK1 Inhibitors Impair Mitosis, Provoke Supernumerary
Centrosomes in NES Cells, and Exacerbate ZIKV-
Related NES Cell Death
Given that the enrichment of pTBK1 at centrosomes of mitotic
NES cells and RGCs is altered by ZIKV infection and that TBK1
has been functionally linked to mitosis (Pillai et al., 2015), we
asked whether pharmacological inhibition of TBK1 kinase activ-
ity could mimic the impairment caused by ZIKV infection. We
therefore treated NCX-NES cells with a small-molecule inhibitor
of TBK1/IKKε, Amlexanox, which inhibits TBK1 activity but not its
phosphorylation on Ser172 (Reilly et al., 2013). We found that
Amlexanox caused a significant decrease in the number of
pTBK1+ mitotic cells and increased the number of cells exhibit-
ing supernumerary centrosomes 3.5 days after application (Fig-
ures 5R and 5S). Similar effects were demonstrated by another
TBK1 inhibitor, BX795 (Figures 5R and 5S). These results are
consistent with our previous finding that ZIKV-induced pTBK1
relocalization correlates with the neurodevelopmental pathology
seen in the infected human brain.
TBK1 also instructs autophagy and apoptosis (Helgason
et al., 2013). Therefore, inhibition of TBK1 may protect cells
from cell death. We next investigated whether inhibiting TBK1
kinase activity impacts ZIKV-induced death of NCX-NES cells
at 3.5 DPI. Application of Amlexanox or BX795 had no effect
on cell death of uninfected cells (Figures S7A and S7B). Howev-
er,

increased
apoptotic cell death in ZIKV-infected NCX-NES cells (Figures
S7A and S7B). Next, we also tested whether the two inhibitors
can affect cell death in ZIKV-infected SC-NES cells at 3.5
DPI. Surprisingly, Amlexanox modestly decreased aCASP3+,
whereas BX795 had no effect at 3.5 DPI (Figure S7C). We tested
the effect of Amlexanox at 5.5 DPI and found that it increased
aCASP3+ in SC-NES cells as observed in NCX-NES cells at
3.5 DPI (Figures S7E and S7F). Together, these results suggest
that inhibition of TBK1 kinase activity can lead to severe cellular
defects in mitotic NES cells and thus may exacerbate ZIKV-
related cytopathology.
Relocalization of pTBK1 by Other Viruses and Innate
Immune Stimulation
Given that TBK1 activation is an important component of innate
antiviral signaling, we examined whether infection with another
flavivirus, dengue-2 virus (DENV), or the TORCH pathogen, hu-
man cytomegalovirus (HCMV), could induce similar relocaliza-
tion of pTBK1. Both DENV and HCMV infected NES cell cultures
(Figures 6A and 6B) but had different effects on pTBK1 localiza-
tion. Although HCMV also induced mitochondrial targeting of
pTBK1, DENV did not (Figures 6A and 6B). This could be
because DENV is known to inhibit the transduction of cytosolic
RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling through mitochondrial anti-
viral signaling (MAVS) and TBK1 to initiate cellular innate antiviral
programs (Dalrymple, Cimica, and Mackow, 2015; He et al.,
2016). Nevertheless, both DENV and HCMV induced cell death
via CASP3 activation (Figure 6C). These data show that TBK1
activation and mitochondrial localization of pTBK1 is not specific
to ZIKV.
To determine whether RLR activation alone could induce the
relocalization of pTBK1 from centrosomes to mitochondria, we
treated NES cells with KIN1408, a small-molecule agonist of
RLRs (Pattabhi et al., 2016). Indeed, KIN1408 treatment induced
relocalization of pTBK1 from centrosomes to mitochondria (Fig-
ures 6D and 6E) and increased CASP3-mediated cell death (Fig-
ures 6D and 6F). Together, these data suggest that ZIKV may

Nucleoside and Nucleotide Analogs Inhibit ZIKV
Replication and Protect NES Cells
There is an urgent need to identify therapeutic approaches for
halting ZIKV infection, especially in pregnant women (Barrows
et al., 2016). Chain-terminating nucleoside analogs have proven
to be potent, broad-spectrum antivirals. Indeed, a few nucleo-
side analogs have already been shown to inhibit ZIKV in cell cul-
ture and mouse models of infection (Zmurko et al., 2016; Eyer
et al., 2016), although the antiviral activity, pharmacology, and
toxicity of these specific molecules in humans are unknown.
We therefore examined whether nucleoside analogs that show
potent inhibition of hepatitis C virus (HCV), another member of
the Flaviviridae, could inhibit ZIKV infection in NES cell cultures.
An initial screen of several HCV inhibitors in Huh-7 hepatoma
cells revealed that the nucleoside analog 20-C-methyladenosine
and the nucleotidyl prodrug Sofosbuvir showed antiviral activity
against ZIKV, whereas Mericitabine, Balapiravir, PSI-6206, and
40-azidocytidine analogs HY-77651 and HY-77652, lacked
ZIKV antiviral activity (data not shown). Importantly, 20-C-methyl-
adenosine and Sofosbuvir both had potent anti-ZIKV activity in
NES cells (Figures 7A and 7B). Sofosbuvir protected NES cells
from ZIKV-induced cell death, whereas 20-C-methyladenosine
exhibited mild toxicity on its own (Figures 7A and 7C). Further-
more, both compounds inhibited the relocalization of pTBK1
(Figure 7D). Together, these data suggest that Sofosbuvir,
a drug approved for treatment of chronic HCV, shows promise
in protecting neural stem cells from ZIKV infection and
pathogenesis.
DISCUSSION
The increased incidence of microcephaly linked to maternal
ZIKV infection has created an international public health crisis.
Understanding ZIKV cell tropism, the impact of ZIKV on cell
biology, and how these effects lead to microcephaly and other
neurodevelopmental phenotypes requires either direct access
to developmental human brain tissue or the development of suit-
able model systems. In this study, we present several key ad-
vances. First, we report on the derivation and characterization
of NES cells, a model system of long-term neuroepithelial stem
cells derived from the NCX or SC. We also show that NES cells
and RGCs are infected, mitotically impaired, and killed by
ZIKV. We describe the relocation and sequestration of pTBK1
from centrosomes to mitochondria following ZIKV infection.
Furthermore, we show that inhibition of TBK1 phenocopies
ZIKV-infection-associated mitotic defects and supernumerary
centrosomes. Finally, we found that two nucleoside analogs,
one of which is an approved drug, can inhibit ZIKV replication

(D) Immunostaining for pTBK1 and phosphorylated VIM (pVIM) in NES cells, labeling centrosome and midbody (arrows). pTBK1 and PAX6 are expressed in fetal
NCX. pTBK1 and pVIM can be detected in NES cells that are dividing. PAX6 is co-expressed with pTBK1 in VZ and SVZ of fetal NCX and labels cells that are in
mitosis. Neither pTBK1 nor PAX6 are detected in CP.
(E–H) NES cells immunostaining shows that pTBK1 is colocalized with the centrosome marker TUBG (G), but not with the mitochondria marker ATP5A1 (E), in non-
infected cells. Contrarily, in ZIKV-infected NES cells, pTBK1 is relocalized to mitochondria, as can be observed by co-staining of pTBK1 with ATP5A1 (F), but not
with TUBG (H). Infected cells have an abnormal number of centrosomes as indicated by arrows. Arrowheads indicate mitochondrial staining, and asterisks
represent multiple nuclei.
(I and J) Electron microscopy confirms the subcellular localization of pTBK1 in the centrosome (red arrows) and cytoplasm (asterisks) of non-infected cells (I). In
infected cells, the signal is detected mainly in mitochondria (J), as indicated by arrowheads. ZIKV particles are also visible in the cytoplasm of infected cells (green
arrows).
(K–N) Immunostaining of pTBK1 in neocortical slices shows its localization in the centrosomes and colocalization with TUBG but not with ATP5A1 in non-infected
cells (K and M). In infected cells, pTBK1 is present in mitochondria (L). Infected cells in mitosis also show an abnormal number of centrosomes (N). In some
infected cells with multiple centrosomes, pTBK1 and TUBG colocalize.
(O) A bar plot indicating the percentage of pTBK1 localized in centrosomes or mitochondria in mock or ZIKV conditions. pTBK1 is mainly localized in centrosomes
in mock or mitochondria in ZIKV-infected cells (number of pTBK1+ NES cells = 23 out of 1,364 total cells for mock and 56 out of 673 total cells for ZIKV; number of
pTBK1+ brain slice cells = 50 from two sections for mock and 31 from four sections for ZIKV). Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Fisher’s exact test, ***p < 0.001.
(P) Jitter plot showing the number of centrosomes in pTBK1+ cells in both NES cells and slice cultures. Although the number of centrosomes is predominantly 2 in
non-infected mitotic cells, in infected cells, it ranges from one to five (number of pTBK1+ NES cells = 40 for mock and 80 for ZIKV condition; number of pTBK1+
brain slice cells = 76 from two sections for mock and 21 from four sections for ZIKV). Fisher’s exact test, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001. Results are presented as
mean ± SD.
(Q) Bar plot of mitochondrial area and mitochondrial density in non-infected and infected NES cells. There is a statistical significant increase in the mitochondrial
area between Mock and ZIKV conditions. No difference is present between mock and ZIKV for mitochondrial density. Two-tailed t test, *p % 0.05. Results are
presented as mean ± SD.
(R) Representative immunofluorescence staining of vehicle-, Amlexanox-, and BX795-treated NCX-NES cells shows supernumerary centrosomes induced by
TBK1 inhibition.
(S) Quantification of pTBK1+ mitotic NCX-NES cells with or without TBK1 inhibition. Results are presented as mean ± SD.

 and cell death in NES cells. These results are consistent with and
substantially add to recent studies on ZIKV neurotropism and
potential entry receptors (Miner and Diamond, 2016).
Several neurogenic populations of stem/progenitor cells have
been developed from mouse or human neural tissue, but many of
these culture systems have limited neurogenic and differentia-
tion potentials (Onorati et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2008). Although
recent work on hPSCs has expanded the range of neural cell
types attainable (Conti and Cattaneo, 2010; Edri et al., 2015;
Koch et al., 2009) and a population of NES cells has been derived
from the hindbrain (Tailor et al., 2013), the NES cell system we
described and characterized is, to our knowledge, the first neu-
ropotent populations derived directly from the prospective NCX
and SC, respectively. As such, NES cells represent a substantial
advance facilitating the study of early development and neuro-

pathology in the human CNS. Addition-
ally, by conducting a comprehensive sin-
gle-cell RNA-seq analysis of NES cells
and human prenatal NCX specimens,
including
matched
donor
tissue,
we
have also generated a resource for future
neuroscience and genomic studies.
By comparing our NES cells to ex vivo fetal organotypic brain
slices and a ZIKV-infected fetal brain, we demonstrated defini-
tively that RGCs are the primary cell type infected by ZIKV in
the prenatal human brain, as previously suggested by using
hPSC-derived neural progenitors or midfetal stem cell systems
(Dang et al., 2016; Garcez et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2016; Tang
et al., 2016; Lazear et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016; Cugola et al.,
2016; Miner et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016; Hanners et al., 2016;

1.full.pdf). We also found that early SC stem cells can be infected
by ZIKV. This is in agreement with a previous report showing SC
defects in ZIKV-infected mouse models (Lazear et al., 2016) as
well as a human case where descending tracts of the SC, partic-
ularly the lateral corticospinal tracts, were very affected (Mlakar
et al., 2016), though this latter phenotype could be a secondary

 consequence of neocortical infection. Why ZIKV infection is
associated with micrencephaly rather than SC defects may in
part be a result of the timing at which infection happens; human
SC completes neurogenesis much earlier than the rest of the
CNS (Silbereis et al., 2016), and so if infection occurs after the
end of the first trimester, then SC cells may rarely be infected.
However, the low percentage of neurons infected in NES cells
and the fact that infected neurons in the organotypic slice cul-
tures appeared only after the infection of VZ/SVZ RGCs suggest
that some neurons may inherit the virus from infected RGCs.

Cell Reports 16, 2576–2592, September 6, 2016
 We found that ZIKV infection of NES cells and RGCs caused a
subcellular relocation of pTBK1 from centrosomal and cytosolic
to mitochondrial locations. Consistent with its role in mitotic
proliferation, pTBK1 was present in mitotic uninfected RGCs
and NES cells throughout the cytoplasm and enriched at the
centrosomes and midbody during cytokinesis. In contrast, we
found that pTBK1 localized to mitochondria in ZIKV infected cells
and was depleted in the cytoplasm and centrosomes. This is in
agreement with the reported recruitment of TBK1 to the mito-
chondrial antiviral signaling platform in response to viral infection
(Belgnaoui et al., 2011; Ning et al., 2014). Taken together, these
results suggest a cell defense mechanism employed by NES
cells and RGCs upon ZIKV infection that may result in abnormal
mitoses. Although mitotic impairment in ZIKV infection has
been described in previous reports (Garcez et al., 2016; Qian
et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016), neither TBK1-asso-
ciated centrosomal nor mitotic defects have been previously
described.
Because altered cell-cycle dynamics may in some instances
cause microcephaly, the removal of pTBK1 from the centrosome
may explain some of the phenotypes associated with ZIKV infec-
tion. To test this hypothesis, we inhibited TBK1 by Amlexanox or
BX795. Application of these inhibitors to NES cells impaired
mitosis and induced supernumerary centrosomes. Multiple cen-
trosomes and nuclei were also present in ZIKV-infected NES
cells and RGCs, confirming that pTBK1 plays an important role
in mitosis in these cells. Intriguingly, the majority of human micro-
cephaly-associated genes encode centrosomal proteins (Diaz
and Gleeson, 2009; Roberts et al., 2000; Woods, 2004). More-
over, studies in mutant mice and humans with mutations in cen-
trosomal genes exhibit deficits including supernumerary centro-
somes and failed cytokinesis, resulting in severely defective
neurogenesis, massive apoptosis in the proliferative zones,
and microcephaly (Bae et al., 2015; Diaz and Gleeson, 2009;
Roberts et al., 2000; Woods, 2004).
pTBK1 is recruited to mitochondria in response to RNA virus
infections, where it serves to transduce signals from MAVS pro-
tein and activate IRF-3 (Liu et al., 2015). Given that other flavivi-
ruses induce RLR-mediated MAVS signaling (Lazear et al., 2013;
Suthar et al., 2013), it is likely that mitochondrial relocalization of
pTBK1 in ZIKV-infected NES cells and RGCs occurs via MAVS
signaling. Supporting this possibility, treatment with KIN1408,
a known RLR agonist, phenocopied both the relocalization of
pTBK1 and the induction of CASP3-mediated cell death in
NES cells. These data therefore support the model that ZIKV
disrupts mitosis in neural stem cells by activating RLRs. Interest-
ingly, the human TORCH pathogen, HCMV, caused a similar
relocalization of pTBK1 and CASP3-mediated cell death. How-
ever, DENV, a flavivirus that inhibits RLR/MAVS/pTBK1 signaling
(Dalrymple, Cimica and Mackow, 2015; He et al., 2016), did not
induce pTBK1 relocalization while still resulting in apoptotic cell
death. It is unlikely that the mitochondrial localization of pTBK1
alone is sufficient to explain the extensive cell death observed
in more severe examples of ZIKV-infected fetal brain. The
presence of uninfected RGCs exhibiting atypical cytomegalic
‘‘balloon’’ morphologies suggests that even uninfected neural
cells can be non-cell-autonomously affected in response to
ZIKV infection (Bell et al., 1971). Different cell types in the adult
brain, including astrocytes, may be infected with ZIKV and none-
theless seem to survive for extended periods of time. In this and
earlier studies in mouse models of ZIKV infection, neurons
maintained normal morphology, despite being infected by ZIKV
and likely survived for extended period of time. Similarly, we
observed numerous RGCs and ependymal cells in ZIKV-infected
postmortem human fetal NCX and SC that exhibited no obvious
signs indicative of impending cell death. Crucially, these cells are
either slowly dividing as neurogenesis has already ceased or are
largely postmitotic, which raises the possibility that the process
of mitosis, or attempting to go through mitosis in the absence of
centrosomal pTBK1, may be the central mechanism underlying
ZIKV-induced depletion of the neural progenitor pool and the
subsequent microcephalic phenotype. Additionally, ZIKV may
not affect neuronal migration even though the centrosome is crit-
ical for this process (Bae et al., 2015; Diaz and Gleeson, 2009;
Woods, 2004).
We identified two nucleoside analogs, including the FDA-
approved drug Sofosbuvir, that inhibit ZIKV infection and cyto-
pathology in NES cells. Additional study is warranted to examine
the efficacy of Sofosbuvir in inhibiting ZIKV in humans and test
safety in pregnant women. In contrast, the TBK1 inhibitor Amlex-
anox, which is used clinically (Reilly et al., 2013), may exacerbate
ZIKV-induced cytopathic effects.
Finally, our work may have significant implications concerning
the effects of infection, the innate immune response, and the
development of the CNS. The human CNS is usually considered
an immunoprivileged organ and is generally protected from
pathogens circulating in the rest of human body during develop-
ment by the placenta (Burton and Fowden, 2015; Mor, 2016) and
the forming blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers
(Marı
´n-Padilla, 2012; Møllga
˚ rd and Saunders, 1986). However,
some pathogens, such as ZIKV, possess the ability to cross
the placenta and blood-brain barriers and infect the brain.
Notably, almost all congenital TORCH infections involve some
aspect of neurodevelopmental defect, including retinopathy,
brain calcification, and microcephaly (Fine and Arndt, 1985;
Neu et al., 2015). Considering shared clinical features and the
pivotal role of TBK1 in the innate immune response to viruses
and in autophagic clearance of various types of pathogens (Hel-
gason et al., 2013; Thurston et al., 2009), we found that HCMV
congenital infections may disrupt the development of human
CNS through overlapping mechanisms that involve altering the
subcellular localization and function of pTBK1 in human neural
stem cells.
Future studies are expected to dissect the role of pTBK1 in
innate immune response and the exact mechanisms by which
centrosomal depletion of pTBK1 is triggered in the context of
RLRs/MAVS signaling. Furthermore, the functional characteriza-
tion of downstream effects of pTBK1 mitochondrial activation
will reveal its role in cell death and potential molecular targets
in a broad scenario of viral infection.
In summary, our study shows the utility of different in vitro and
ex vivo model systems of human neural stem cells for studying
early neurodevelopment and ZIKV infections and reveals cellular
and molecular mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental
defects associated with ZIKV infection and, potentially, other
pathogens.

This study was conducted using de-identified postmortem human specimens
from tissue collection at the Department of Neuroscience, Yale School of
Medicine, and tissue specimens provided by the Human Developmental
Biology Resource (www.hdbr.org) and by the Laboratory of Developmental
Biology at the University of Washington. Appropriate informed consent was
obtained, and all available non-identifying information was recorded for each
specimen. All work was performed according to NIH guidelines for the acqui-
sition and distribution of human tissue for bio-medical research purposes and
with approval by the Human Investigation Committees and Institutional Ethics
Committees of each institute from which samples were obtained. Appropriate
written informed consent was obtained, and all available non-identifying infor-
mation was recorded for each sample. Details of the specimens analyzed are
provided in the Supplemental Information.
Human NES Cells Derivation
NES cells were derived from dorsal forebrain and SC from de-identified prena-
tal human specimens. In brief, tissues were dissociated until a single-cell sus-
pension was formed. Cells were resuspended and plated into coated dishes.
See the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details.
Single-Cell RNA-Seq Analysis
Cells were captured using C1 Single-Cell Auto Prep Integrated Fluidic Circuit
(Fluidigm). Single-cell sequencing libraries were generated according to man-
ufacturer’s protocol. Reads were aligned using STAR (v2.4.0). Gene expres-
sion was calculated using RSEQTools and SAMtools. See the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures for details and analysis pipelines.
Ex Vivo Fetal Organotypic Slices Cultures
Neocortical walls from four fetal brains were dissected in hibernate solution.
Tissue was then imbedded in agarose and sectioned. 300 mm slices were
transferred to cell culture with neuronal medium. See the Supplemental Exper-
imental Procedures for details.
Preparation of Virus Stocks
ZIKV strain FSS 13025 was obtained from the World Reference Center for
Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses at University of Texas Medical Branch, Gal-
veston. The Brazilian ZIKV strain PE243 was recovered from a 19-year-old fe-
male in Brazil in late 2015. DENV-2 strain 16681 was recovered from the cDNA
clone pD2/IC-30P. See the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details.
Independent stocks of HCMV-GFP were kindly supplied by Felicia Goodrum
and Scott Terhune.
ZIKV Infection of NES Cells and Fetal Organotypic Brain Slices
For NES cell infections, cells were seeded 1 day before virus addition. All viral
infections were performed under the same conditions at an MOI of 0.1 for 2 hr
followed by three washes and addition of fresh NES medium. For fetal organo-
typic brain slices, viruses were added to culture medium. See the Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures for details.
Application of Small-Molecule Inhibitors
Amlexanox was applied at 10 mM, BX795 at 1 mM, and KIN1408 at 10 mM (final
concentration). Sofosbuvir and 20C-methyladenosine were applied at the indi-
cated concentrations. See the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for
details.
BrdU Labeling, Immunostaining, and Electron Microscopy
10 mM BrdU was administered 30 min prior to viral infection and then continued
until cell harvesting. For immunostaining, fixed samples were permeabilized
and blocked at room temperature, incubated with primary antibodies over-
night at 4�C, washed and incubated with secondary antibodies. All images
were acquired using a fluorescent microscopy or a laser scanning confocal mi-
croscope. For detailed methods and electron microscopy. see the Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures.
RNA Isolation, Droplet Digital PCR, and Immunoblotting
Total RNA or proteins were extracted from mock and infected samples as
described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Statistical Analysis
The presented data are mean ± SD or SEM from three separate experiments.
Differences between the groups were analyzed using a Student’s t test.
Values of all significant correlations are given with degree of significance indi-
cated (* p % 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001). For organotypic slice culture,
quantification was performed in up to four sections that were representative of
at least three slices. Cells were counted as described in the respective figure
legend. The number of cells with pTBK1 located in centrosomes or mitochon-
dria follows a binomial distribution. A Fisher’s exact test was performed in or-
der to compare the control and the infected and treated group. Similarly, to test
whether infection changed the number of centrosomes, the cells were binned
by the number of centrosomes (1–5), and a Fisher’s exact test was performed
in order to compare control with infected and treated cells.
