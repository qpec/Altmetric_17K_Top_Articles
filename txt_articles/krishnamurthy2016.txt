Schistosoma mansoni cercariae swim efciently by
exploiting an elastohydrodynamic coupling
Deepak Krishnamurthy1, Georgios Katsikis1, Arjun Bhargava2 and Manu Prakash3*
The motility of many parasites is critical for infecting their
host, as exemplified in the transmission cycle of the para-
site Schistosoma mansoni1. In its human infectious stage, sub-
millimetre-scale forms of the parasite known as cercariae swim
in freshwater and infect humans by penetrating the skin1,2.
This infection causes schistosomiasis, a disease comparable to
malariainglobalsocio-economicimpact3,4.Giventhatcercariae
do not feed and hence have a lifetime of around 12 hours5,6,
efcient motility is crucial for schistosomiasis transmission.
Despite this, a first-principles understanding of how cercariae
swim is lacking. Combining biological experiments, a novel
theoretical model and its robotic realization, we show that cer-
cariae use their forked tail to swim against gravity using a novel
swimming gait, described here as a ‘T-swimmer gait’. During
this gait, cercariae beat their tail periodically while maintain-
ing an increased flexibility near their posterior and anterior
ends. This flexibility allows an interaction between fluid drag
and bending resistance—an elastohydrodynamic coupling, to
naturally break time-reversal symmetry and enable locomotion
at small length scales7. Finally, we find that cercariae maintain
this flexibility at an optimal regime for efcient swimming. We
anticipate that our work sets the ground for linking the swim-
mingofcercariaetodiseasetransmission,andcouldpotentially
enable explorations of novel strategies for schistosomiasis
control and prevention.
In their natural habitat of rivers and ponds, S. mansoni cercariae
are released from intermediate snail hosts and aggregate below
the water surface to increase their chances of finding a human
host8,9 (Fig. 1a). The cercariae are around 500 µm long and consist
of an anterior body, a slender tail and a posterior bifurcation of
the tail called the ‘furca’
, henceforth termed the fork (Fig. 1b)10,11.
Being negatively buoyant, they need to swim against gravity to stay
near the water surface, which they accomplish by using their fork
(Fig. 1b (i))10,11. The fork is an uncommon appendage, not found
in any well-studied swimming microorganisms such as bacteria12,
or ciliates13,14. Also, unlike the aforementioned microorganisms,
cercariae do not feed5,6. Hence their swimming efficiency is an
important determinant of their ability to survive longer to find
and infect humans. For such an important human parasite, while
a body of work has focused on the behavioural1,2 and qualitative
aspects10,15 of cercarial motility, the swimming mechanics of
cercariae remains unknown.
To mimic the natural habitat of cercariae we conducted
laboratory experiments with multiple freely swimming specimens
in a 4 cm × 1 cm × 1.4 mm chamber which is much larger
than their own size (≈500 µm). We observed that cercariae
display an intermittent swimming behaviour consisting of three
modes10,11 (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Movie 1 and 2): A tail-
first mode in which they swim up against gravity with their
fork fully extended (Fig. 1b (i)), a free-sinking mode on account
of being negatively buoyant where the fork is partially extended
(Fig. 1b (ii)), and a body-first mode which is used to approach
towards the skin, where the fork is folded back (Fig. 1b (iii)). We
analysed trajectories (n=2,774 segments; Supplementary Methods)
of individual cercariae and obtained the relative time durations
spent in each mode. We found that cercariae spend a majority
of their time in the free-sinking mode (83% of the total time)
with a mean sinking speed �Vsinking� = 0.1 mm s−1, followed by
the tail-first swimming mode (17%) with �Vtail-first�=0.7 mm s−1.
The body-first mode is often triggered by chemical cues16–18
which are absent in our current experiments, leading to very
few observed trajectories (<0.1%). Despite the fact that cercariae
spend longer periods of time freely sinking, we expect that
most of the energy consumption occurs during the tail-first
mode5, since this involves active swimming. Thus, the swimming
efficiency of the tail-first mode directly affects the ability of
cercariae to aggregate near the water surface to increase chances
of encountering a human host. Also, given that the swimming
gait of cercariae in the tail-first mode is distinct from that of
well-studied microorganisms14, it is of fundamental interest to
understand its mechanics.
To study the tail-first swimming mode we conducted high-speed
imaging experiments (Supplementary Methods) on individual
cercariae. We observed that cercariae swim using a periodic gait,
wherein they beat their tail from side to side with a frequency f
in the range 15–20 Hz (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Movie 3). In
addition to this periodic beating of the tail, cercariae also undergo
a much slower rotation about an axis parallel to their swimming
direction, causing the plane in which the tail beats to rotate slowly
over time. However, this is much slower (taking ≈840 ms for a
complete rotation) than a swimming cycle (tcycle = 1/f ≈ 50 ms),
hence justifying a two-dimensional description of the swimming
motion. The origin and role of this slow rotation are beyond the
scope of this paper and offer opportunities for future work.
For understanding the hydrodynamics of cercarial swimming
and the relative contribution of inertial and viscous forces, we
estimated the relevant Reynolds number Re=�Vtail-first�L/ν ≈0.3,
where L ≈ 500 µm is the organism length and ν = 10−6 m2 s−1
is the kinematic viscosity of the ambient fluid (water). This
Re < 1 indicates the relative dominance of viscous over inertial
forces in the swimming. To confirm this we measured the flow
field around the organism using particle image velocimetry (PIV)
(Supplementary Methods) and observed regions of recirculating
fluid (vortices) which remain adjacent to the organism (Fig. 2d,e
and Supplementary Movie 4). We have further analysed metrics
of the flow surrounding the cercariae (Supplementary Fig. 1) and
demonstrated that inertial forces may be neglected in studying
cercarial swimming. We therefore studied the hydrodynamics of

horizontal direction. This is due to the fact that cercariae are bottom-heavy swimmers (Supplementary Fig. 2) and undergo a gravitational realignment such
that their longitudinal axis is aligned with the vertical with the body pointing down. Scale bar, 1 mm.
cercarial swimming using purely viscous or Stokes flow theories
which correspond to the limit Re=0 (ref. 19).
To achieve locomotion, cercariae, like any swimmer dominated
by viscosity, must change their shape in a manner that breaks
time-reversal symmetry7,13. Using image analysis we extracted the
dynamic shape of the organism (Fig. 2a) and observed that their
periodic gait consists of successive power and recovery strokes that
break time-reversal symmetry. During a power stroke, the tail bends
from a straightened state to its maximally curved state, while the fork
sweeps out an arc, moving almost perpendicular to its longitudinal
axis (sequence 1→2 in Fig. 2a,c,d,f and Supplementary Movie 5).
The fork’s motion is directed towards the body of the organism,
generating a thrust force that pulls the body forward along the
mean swimming direction ˆ
s (sequence 1→2 in Fig. 2a,c). During
a recovery stroke the tail returns to its straightened state and
the fork moves parallel to its own longitudinal axis (sequence
2 → 3 in Fig. 2a,c,e,f and Supplementary Movie 5), pushing the
body backwards. Owing to the different orientation of the fork,
this backward displacement is smaller than that during the power
stroke, thus leading to a cumulative displacement of the body
along ˆ
s. The body of the organism additionally generates thrust by
breaking time-reversal symmetry (sequence 1 and 3 in Fig. 2c,f)
in a manner similar to conventional Stokesian swimming strategies
which involve waving an elastic arm20.
At low Re the fluid drag on a body is only weakly anisotropic
as compared to the same body at high Re. For slender bodies, such
as the fork in cercariae (aspect ratio ≈ 20), the drag at low Re is
around twice as large when the body moves perpendicular to its
longitudinal axis as compared to parallel to this axis21. By moving
the fork perpendicular and parallel to its axis during the power and
recovery strokes, respectively (Supplementary Movie 5), cercariae
seem to maximally utilize this weak anisotropy.
The kinematics of the fork and body in relation to the tail,
as quantified by the respective joint angles (Fig. 2b), highlight
the non-reciprocal nature of the swimming gait which breaks
time-reversal symmetry (Fig. 2f). Interestingly, the tail bends
symmetrically and does not contribute to the breaking of time-
reversal symmetry (right axis of Fig. 2c). Therefore cercarial
locomotion crucially depends on the degree of freedom at the
tail–fork and tail–body joints (Fig. 2b). These degrees of freedom
appear to be a result of increased local flexibility in the joints due to
smooth-muscle-mediated constrictions in the transverse dimension
of the organism10,22.
To further understand the swimming mechanism and exactly
how these joint angles evolve over time, we hypothesize the simplest
passive control strategy where a balance between elastic bending
stiffness and viscous drag forces dictates the exact kinematics of
cercarial swimming—an elastohydrodynamic effect, rather than
active muscular control. We conjecture that cercariae maintain
a fixed local stiffness at these joints using smooth musculature,
modifying only the joint stiffness when they change their swimming
mode. Our hypotheses are supported by earlier studies, which
demonstrate that the striated muscles that are capable of rapid
beating are confined to the tail, and not present in the fork11,23. To test
our hypotheses we developed a theoretical model: a ‘T-swimmer’
,
consisting of three, linear, rigid links (Fig. 3a (ii)). The first two
links correspond to the fore and aft ends of the body–tail portion
in cercariae, and the third link, which is attached transversely at
its midpoint, corresponds to the fork (Fig. 3a (i) and (ii)). In our
geometry, as a starting point, we neglect the body in cercariae
and also the effects of gravity, to make the simplest possible
swimming model (Fig. 3a (ii)). As the reader will quickly notice,
our ‘T-swimmer’ is inspired by Purcell’s three-link-swimmer7, often
referred to as the simplest low-Reynolds-number swimmer since it
requires only two actively actuated joints. In contrast to Purcell’s
swimmer, in the T-swimmer only a single longitudinal joint is
actively actuated (red dot in Fig. 3a (ii)), to model the bending of the
tail of cercariae, while the transverse joint is passive and assumed to
be a linear torsional spring (blue spiral in Fig. 3a (ii)).
The parameters of the T-swimmer include the lengths of the
links (l1, l2, l3) and their transverse dimensions (r1, r2, r3); the
actuation amplitude of the active joint A, the driving frequency
f and the torsional stiffness of the passive joint �tf (Fig. 3a (ii)).
We non-dimensionalized the system using the half-length of the
organism lc = L/2 and the timescale tc = 1/f . The force and
torque scales follow the viscous scaling Fc = µfl2
c and τc = µfl3
c ,
respectively19. Therefore the key dynamical parameter of the system
is the dimensionless torsional stiffness ˆ
�tf =�tf/(µfl3
c ).

Figure 2 | Shape kinematics of S. mansoni cercariae swimming in the tail-first mode. a, Extracted dynamic shapes from high-speed videos of cercariae at
diferent time points during a swimming cycle (Supplementary Methods). The trajectory of the body is colour-coded based on the instantaneous velocity
magnitude along the local tangent (ˆ

s (left axis) demonstrates forward motion although the mean-curvature of the tail (right
axis) is symmetric, seemingly appearing to be a reciprocal stroke. Grey regions (1→2,3→4 and so on) correspond to power strokes where the body of
the organism has a tangential velocity in the mean swimming direction, while white regions (2→3,4→1� and so on) are recovery strokes where the body
moves in the opposite direction. Time is normalized by 1/f, where f =15.6 Hz is the beat frequency. d,e, Snapshots of the transient flow velocity exhibiting

regions of vorticity remain attached to the organism and are not shed (Supplementary Movie 4). f, Phase plot of φtb and φtf as a function of φt clearly
shows a finite area, hence revealing the role of tail–fork and tail–body joints in producing a non-reciprocal swimming stroke, required for
low-Reynolds-number swimming. Scale bars, 100 µm.
To specify the hydrodynamic forces and torques on the
T-swimmer we used local slender-body-theory21 and solved the
resulting equations of motion numerically (Supplementary Sec-
tion 3.1). Our results show that the T-swimmer swims with the
passive joint preceding the active one, kinematically similar to cer-
cariae swimming tail-first (Supplementary Video 6). In contrast,
a slight variation of the classic Purcell’s swimmer, which has one
active and one passive joint, swims in an opposite direction to
the T-swimmer, with the active joint preceding the passive one
(Supplementary Movie 6 and ref. 24). Our results demonstrate that
a simple transition from a longitudinal to a transverse link, either
of which are attached via a torsional spring, results in a reversal in
swimming direction (Supplementary Movie 6)—a viable strategy for
any organism trying to reverse swimming directions from body-first
to tail-first.
For validating our theory we also performed scaled-up experi-
ments on a centimetre-scale (Lrobot ≈ 10 cm) robot mimicking
our T-swimmer (Fig. 3a (iii)). The robot was immersed in a
corn-syrup medium to achieve dynamically similar conditions
(Rerobot ≈ 0.2) to swimming cercariae (Supplementary Methods).
We found that both the T-swimmer (Fig. 3b) and the robot (Fig. 3c)
reproduce the non-reciprocal swimming gait of cercariae, thereby
supporting our hypothesis (Fig. 2f). For both the T-swimmer and
the robot, we varied ˆ
�tf and A and found that in the upper
and lower limits of joint stiffness (ˆ
�tf � 1 and ˆ
�tf �1), the gait
becomes reciprocal (Fig. 3b,c) and the swimming speed averaged
over > 20 cycles is negligible (Fig. 3d,e,f). This is explained
by the fact that for ˆ
�tf �1 the swimmer has a single degree
of freedom, since the tail–fork joint is rigid, and for ˆ
�tf � 1,
there is again a single effective degree of freedom due to the
torque-free condition at the tail–fork joint. The small but non-
zero swimming speeds measured for the robot even for the case
of ˆ
�tf � 1 and ˆ
�tf �1 (horizontal asymptotes in Fig. 3e) are
attributed to effects of small but non-zero inertia, since Rerobot ≈0.2,

The white dashed line denotes the starting point of the robots. The free (i) and fixed joint (v) robots show relatively small displacements (Supplementary
Movie 7). Scale bar in (i), 5 cm.
and in the ˆ
�tf � 1 case, also due to the small bending degree
of freedom that arises due to minute deflections in the material
used to fabricate the robot. For both the T-swimmer and the
robot, there is an intermediate value of torsional stiffness ˆ
�tf
that optimizes the average swimming speed (Fig. 3d,e,f and
Supplementary Movie 7). This happens due to resonant interaction
between the driving timescale (tforcing = 1/f ) and the intrinsic
relaxation time of the torsional spring (trelaxation =µl3
c / �tf)—that is,
1/f ∼µl3
c / �tf.
As a next extension to the three-link T-swimmer, we added a
fourth link to account for the thrust generated by the body in
cercariae and also included the effects of gravity (Supplementary
Section 2.2). This fourth link is attached longitudinally via a
torsional spring to model the flexibility of the tail–body joint

(Fig. 4a). The resulting model can now be compared to experimental
measurements on S. mansoni cercariae.
To make this comparison, we need the torsional spring stiffness
of the two joints (ˆ
�tb and ˆ
�tf) in a living (swimming) cercariae. We
developed a novel in situ measurement using high-speed imaging
data (Fig. 2) and hydrodynamic theory25. To do this, first we used
slender-body-theory19 to estimate the instantaneous torques at the
two joints τ tf and τ tb from the translational and angular velocities
of the fork and body (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Section 2.3).
We then investigated the relationship between these torques and
the corresponding joint angles φtf and φtb and found that they are
linearly correlated (Fig. 4c). This linearity implies that the two joints
are indeed well approximated as linear torsional springs, serving
as a posteriori verification of our T-swimmer model. Finally, we
obtained the torsional spring stiffness of the two joints as the slopes
of the linear fits.
By comparing our four-link T-swimmer with experiments on
S. mansoni cercariae (Supplementary Movie 8), we find that the
theoretical four-link T-swimmer indeed captures the swimming
displacement per cycle (Fig. 4d) and the time evolution of the
non-reciprocal joint angle kinematics very well (Fig. 4e). A crucial
connection to disease transmission lies in the swimming efficiency

of this human parasite. Next, we estimate the cercarial swimming
efficiency using our T-swimmer model. To measure how effectively
cercariae can swim up the water column, we defined this efficiency
as the ratio of average distance covered relative to the average
viscous power dissipation in the fluid during a swimming cycle
ηdist = Xstroke/Pdiss,stroke (Supplementary Section 3.1). By exploring a
range of values in the (ˆ
�tf, ˆ
�tb) plane we find a single optimal point
for both the swimming speed (Fig. 4f) and efficiency (Fig. 4g).
Interestingly, we observed that the joint spring stiffnesses estimated
for cercariae (red dots in Fig. 4f,g) lies close to this optimal peak.
This suggests that cercariae maintain the stiffness of these two
joints at the optimal range required for efficient swimming. This
tuning may have resulted from strong evolutionary pressures on the
parasite, since the host-seeking processes is energy constrained5,6.
Our work points to an unusual elastohydrodynamic effect
in cercarial swimming, where the tail provides the energy for
propulsion but little thrust, while tail–body and tail–fork joints
act as passive torsional springs providing most of the thrust.
This passive control strategy is minimalistic in nature, where the
only control lies in tuning the flexibility of the respective joints.
Furthermore, cercariae are the first reported organisms to use both
a longitudinal (the body) and transverse element (the fork)14,26
to generate a net propulsion from bending waves propagating in
opposite directions (due to the tail).

have
significant limitations27, mechanistically linking biophysics of
human-seeking parasites such as S. mansoni to disease transmission
in ecological field conditions could inspire a new paradigm of
environmental control of this neglected tropical disease. The
limited energy reserves of the cercarial stage of this parasite
may be its Achilles heel. Being of a higher density than water,
simply targeting the swimming motility could impair the parasites
ability to aggregate near the air–water interface, thereby reducing
transmission rates. Towards this, our study of the swimming
mechanics has given the first quantitative estimate of the swimming
efficiency, and allows an understanding of how perturbations to
various parameters affect the motility of cercariae.
