A
s a result of biphasic changes in peripheral arterial resis-
tance during pregnancy, the blood pressure (BP) level 
undergoes a gradual decrease to the nadir at midpregnancy and 
returns to a prepregnant level through term.1,2 Consequently, 
this physiological alteration leads to the question of whether 
the criteria for the diagnosis of gestational hypertension are 
suitable because the current criteria (systolic BP [SBP] ≥140 
mm Hg and diastolic BP [DBP] ≥90 mm Hg) are derived from 
the nonpregnant population. The optimal BP levels in pregnant 
women remain an open question.
Emerging evidence shows that prehypertension (120–
139/80–89 mm Hg), defined by the seventh report of the Joint 
National Committee on Prevention,3 not only increases the 
risk of incident hypertension but also is associated with an 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).4–7 Although 
prehypertension is not addressed by the eighth Joint National 
Committee on Prevention,8 the diagnosis of prehypertension 
provides a unique understanding of when future CVD trajec-
tories could be changed by lifestyle modifications.4 Recent 
studies have demonstrated associations between prehyperten-
sion before pregnancy and hypertensive disorders during preg-
nancy and gestational diabetes mellitus.9–11 To our knowledge, 
the association between prehypertension during pregnancy 
and postpartum cardiovascular risk has not been addressed.
Pregnancy is a known, long-term cardiovascular stress test 
for women. The presence of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy 
(HDP) is generally recognized as a maladaptation to pregnancy-
induced hemodynamic and metabolic alterations.12,13 In addition, 
Abstract—The nonstratification of blood pressure (BP) levels may underestimate future cardiovascular risk in pregnant women 
who present with BP levels in the range of prehypertension (120–139/80–89 mm Hg). We prospectively evaluated the 
relationship between multiple antepartum BP measurements (from 11+0 to 13+6 weeks’ gestation to term) and the occurrence 
of postpartum metabolic syndrome in 507 normotensive pregnant women after a live birth. By using latent class growth 
modeling, we identified the following 3 distinctive diastolic BP (DBP) trajectory groups: the low-J-shaped group (34.2%; 
DBP from 62.5±5.8 to 65.0±6.8 mm Hg), the moderate-U-shaped group (52.6%; DBP from 71.0±5.9 to 69.8±6.2 mm Hg), 
and the elevated-J-shaped group (13.2%; DBP from 76.2±6.7 to 81.8±4.8 mm Hg). Notably, the elevated-J-shaped trajectory 
group had mean DBP and systolic BP levels within the range of prehypertension from 37+0 and 26+0 weeks of pregnancy, 
respectively. Among the 309 women who completed the ≈1.6 years of postpartum follow-up, the women in the elevated-J-
shaped group had greater odds of developing postpartum metabolic syndrome (adjusted odds ratio, 6.55; 95% confidence 
interval, 1.79–23.92; P=0.004) than the low-J-shaped group. Moreover, a parsimonious model incorporating DBP 
(membership in the elevated-J-shaped group but not in the DBP prehypertension group as identified by a single measurement) 
and elevated levels of fasting glucose (>4.99 mmol/L) and triglycerides (>3.14 mmol/L) at term was developed, with good 
discrimination and calibration for postpartum metabolic syndrome (c-statistic, 0.764; 95% confidence interval, 0.674–
0.855; P<0.001). Therefore, prehypertension identified by DBP trajectories throughout pregnancy is an independent risk 
factor for predicting postpartum metabolic syndrome in normotensive pregnant women.  (Hypertension. 2016;68:455-

women with HDP have a clustering of metabolic syndrome 
(MetS) traits during and after pregnancy,14–17 which suggests that 
HDP, MetS, and future CVD are closely related.15,18–20 Despite a 
consistent association between HDP and future cardiovascular 
risk,21–23 the relationship between antepartum prehypertension 
and postpartum cardiometabolic risk is unclear. Therefore, in 
the present study, we examined the association between prehy-
pertension during pregnancy and the postpartum occurrence of 
cardiometabolic risk clustering, ie, MetS, which is a surrogate 
marker of cardiovascular health, in a cohort of women with nor-
motensive and uncomplicated pregnancies.
Methods
Study Cohort
This prospective cohort study was performed in a specialized hospital 
for women and children in Guangzhou, the third largest city in China. 
The aim of the study was to investigate the antepartum and postpartum 
health of women and fetuses/infants. Consecutive pregnant women 
were considered eligible if they met the following criteria: gestational 
age between 11+0 and 13+6 weeks, singleton pregnancy, normal BP lev-
els (<140/90 mm Hg), normal glucose and lipid profiles, nonsmokers, 
no history of alcohol or substance abuse, and no history of vaginal 
bleeding. In addition, to maximize the follow-up rate, all participants 
had to be registered as permanent residents of Guangzhou. Informed 
consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki, and the study was approved by the Hospital 
Ethics Committee. The study design and research flowchart are shown 
in Figure 1. A standardized questionnaire was completed for every 
participant through interviews and the review of patient medical 
records. The questionnaire contained demographic, medical, gyneco-
logical, obstetric and social history, as well as inquiries about body 
mass index before pregnancy, gestational weight gain, and the vital 
signs obtained during the physical examination. Obstetric measure-
ments, ultrasound scans, and biochemical tests were also performed to 
ensure the medical health status of all participants and fetuses. At the 
end of the pregnancies, after excluding the patients with maternal and 
fetal abnormalities, the remaining participants with a live birth were 
enrolled for BP trajectory modeling (see Statistical Analysis section of 
this article) and postpartum follow-up.
Antepartum and Postpartum Check-Up
From 11+0 to 13+6 weeks of gestation (participant enrollment) until 
term, at least 7 antepartum visits were performed. The routine antepar-
tum check-up included body weight, BP, and obstetric measurements 
and an ultrasound scan. All obstetric measurements were performed 
by well-trained midwives or obstetricians. There were no between-
midwife variations in the mean values of the data collected, and the 
error rates were consistently <1% in the repeated data entry checks. 
The body weight and BP measurements (see below) were taken on the 
morning of each visit. Antepartum biochemical tests were conducted 
at the antenatal clinic visit closest to delivery (≥37+0 weeks).
The routine postpartum follow-up visit was performed within 6 to 
12 weeks postpartum. In addition, a second follow-up visit was per-
formed between May 1, 2011, and April 30, 2015 (0.5–3 years post-
partum) to evaluate postpartum cardiometabolic risk. Body weight, 
BP, and waist circumference were measured.
Venous blood samples after an overnight fast were collected at base-
line (gestational ages of 11+0–13+6), before term, and during the second 
postpartum follow-up to measure the levels of plasma glucose (FPG), 
insulin, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), 
triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, and free fatty acids. Insulin resis-
tance was assessed by the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR).24
Definitions
To minimize variations in BP measurement, each subject was com-
fortably seated with his/her back supported for at least 10 minutes of 
rest, and then, a standard cuff for adults fitted with a mercury sphyg-
momanometer was used to check BP by a trained nurse. BP was mea-
sured on the right arm by placing the stethoscope bell lightly over the 
brachial artery and auscultating the Korotkoff sounds. BP was usually 
measured once. If BP was ≥140/90 mm Hg, a second measurement 
was performed after at least 5 minutes of rest, and the average of the 
2 BP values was recorded. Hypertension was defined by an SBP ≥140 
mm Hg and DBP ≥90 mm Hg on 3 visits or by current treatment with 
antihypertensive medications.
During the second postpartum follow-up, the following cardio-
metabolic risk factors were assessed in all participants: elevated waist 
circumference (≥80 cm, according to specific definition for Chinese 
women), elevated triglycerides level (≥1.7 mmol/L), decreased 
HDL-C level (<1.3 mmol/L), elevated FPG level (≥5.6 mmol/L), and 
elevated BP level (≥135/85 mm Hg).25 MetS was defined as the clus-
tering of ≥3 of the risk factors listed above.25
Statistical Analysis
To delineate the pattern of BP changes during pregnancy, we used 
latent class growth modeling to identify the distinctive subgroups 
that shared a similar underlying BP trajectory.26 BP trajectories were 
modeled among the 507 uncomplicated, normotensive pregnant 
women, with the BP measurements obtained at the gestational ages of 
11+0–13+6, 21+0–24+6, 25+0–28+6, 29+0–32+6, 33+0–36+6, 37+0–38+6, and 
40+0 weeks during the routine obstetric examinations at the outpa-
tient department. Only the participants who finished the second post-
partum follow-up visit were included in the models examining the 
associations between BP indices and MetS. The STATA procedure 
traj, a new plugin for estimating group-based trajectory models that 
is similar to a well-established SAS-based procedure (Proc Traj),27,28 
was used for the analysis with a censored normal model that was 
appropriate for continuous, normally distributed data. The BP indi-
ces used for the modeling included DBP, SBP, mean arterial pressure 
(MAP), and mean mid-BP (calculated as [SBP+DBP]/2, a marker of 
coronary heart disease risk among younger populations).29,30 The fol-
lowing criteria were used to determine the number of BP trajectory 
groups and the trajectory shapes for each BP index31,32: (1) an a priori

knowledge of BP development over time; (2) tendency toward a par-
simonious model; (3) the difference between a simpler model and 
the more complex model by log Bayes Factor (higher values indicate 
stronger differences); and (4) each group had an average posterior 
probability of group membership >0.80.
Continuous variables with normal distributions are presented as the 
mean±SD or as medians with interquartile ranges if the data failed 
the normality test unless otherwise specified. Dichotomous data are 
presented as numbers and percentages. The differences between the 
groups were tested with Student t test, and categorical data were tested 
with the χ2 test. Comparisons of continuous data with a skewed distri-
bution were performed using the Mann–Whitney U test. To determine 
the association between BP trajectory membership of each BP index 
and postpartum MetS, a univariate logistic regression analysis was 
performed, followed by an adjustment for potential confounders that 
significantly differed between the MetS and the non-MetS participants. 
The κ statistic was used to assess the agreement between the BP trajec-
tory-defined high-risk participants and the high-risk subjects identified 
by a single BP measurement at term. To construct prediction models for 
postpartum MetS using clinical variables at term, a receiver operator 
characteristic curve analysis was first used to assess the accuracy and the 
optimal cutoff value (the best Youden Index: sensitivity+specificity−1) 
of MetS-related parameters (FPG, triglycerides, HDL-C, SBP trajecto-
ries, SBP prehypertension exposure at term, SBP [as a continuous vari-
able] at term, DBP trajectories, DBP prehypertension exposure at term, 
and DBP [as a continuous variable] at term) to discriminate between 
postpartum MetS and non-MetS participants. Subsequently, variables 
with a P<0.1 were included in the multivariate logistic regression 
model to identify the most parsimonious, clinically sound predictors of 
postpartum MetS. Internal validation of the prediction models was per-
formed by bootstrapping, using 1000 random resamples from the entire 
data set. Model discrimination and calibration were performed using 
the c-statistic and the Hosmer–Lemeshow test, respectively. During the 
follow-up, univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were 
used to establish associations between the value of the study param-
eters and BP levels. For all tests, a 2-tailed P<0.05 indicated statistical 
significance. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 
14.1 (STATA Corp., College Station, TX).
Results
Initially, a total of 2193 normotensive pregnant women with 
an estimated delivery date between October 1, 2010, and 
September 30, 2012, were enrolled for further examinations. 
During the antepartum visits, 1332 women withdrew from 
the study, and another 354 women were excluded because of 
maternal and fetal abnormalities. Therefore, the postpartum 
follow-up was performed on 507 women with a live birth and 
complete data for all maternal characteristics; the BP trajec-
tory modeling was also performed on these 507 women. A 
total of 311 participants finished the postpartum follow-up 
visit and had complete data available for analysis. After 2 par-
ticipants were excluded because they did not consent to the 
use of the outcome data, 309 cases were analyzed, resulting 
in a follow-up rate of 60.9% (309/507). Notably, there was no 
self-reported smoking data for our cohort.
As shown in Table 1, among the 309 participants with 
follow-up data, 35 participants (11.3%) had MetS. Compared 
with non-MetS subjects, MetS participants had more 
advanced maternal age, elevated free fatty acids level before 
delivery, higher neonatal weight, and higher prepregnancy, 
term, and follow-up body mass index. In addition, the MetS 
participants were also characterized by a progressive deterio-
ration of insulin resistance, with a nonsignificant elevation 
of HOMA-IR at baseline and at term, as well as a significant 
increase during follow-up.
To investigate the associations between pregnancy BP 
indices and postpartum MetS, we first modeled the DBP, 
SBP, MAP, and mid-BP trajectories during pregnancy in the 
507 participants. For DBP, a 3-trajectory group model with 
quadratic specifications for all groups was identified. The 3 
discrete trajectory lines, as well as the dynamic changes in 
DBP and SBP levels, are plotted in Figure 2. In this group 
model (Figure 2A), 32.4% of the participants maintained a 
low DBP level at 11+0 to 13+6 weeks, with a J-shaped change 
until term (group 1: herein referred to the low-J-shaped group; 
DBP from 62.5±5.8 mm Hg at gestational weeks of 11+0–13+6 
to 65.0±6.8 mm Hg at term), 52.5% of participants had a mean 
DBP level of ≈70 mm Hg at 11+0 to 13+6 weeks, with a slightly 
U-shaped change during pregnancy (group 2: the moderate-
U-shaped group; DBP from 71.0±5.9 to 69.8±6.2 mm Hg), 
and 13.2% participants had an elevated baseline DBP level 
of ≈75 mm Hg, with a J-shaped change thereafter (group 3: 
the elevated-J-shaped group; DBP from 76.2±6.7 to 81.8±4.8 
mm Hg). Notably, the elevated-J-shaped trajectory group had 
mean DBP and SBP levels within the range of prehypertension 
from 37+0 weeks and 26+0 weeks of pregnancy (Figures 2B and 
2C), respectively. Thus, this group represents individuals with 
BP levels similar to prehypertension. Moreover, based on a 
recent report on gestational age–specific reference ranges for 
BP in pregnancy,33 the normal BP ranges should be between 
the low-J-shaped group and the moderate-U-shaped group. 
Consequently, the moderate-U-shaped group represents par-
ticipants with BP levels between normal and prehypertension 
levels. Thus, our normotensive cohort-based, 3-trajectory 
group model is generally in agreement with a recent longi-
tudinal study that modeled BP development in a cohort from 
childhood to early midlife into 4 trajectories (hypertensive, 
prehypertensive, high-normal, and normal).32 The gestational 
BP trajectory groups for SBP, MAP, and mid-BP are shown in 
Figures S1 to S3 in the online-only Data Supplement.
We next examined which of the BP index-derived 3-trajec-
tory models could best predict the occurrence of MetS postpar-
tum. As shown in Table 2 of the 309 participants with available 
follow-up data, the patients in the elevated-J-shaped group 
had greater odds of having MetS than individuals in the low-
J-shaped DBP trajectory group (odds ratio [OR], 5.16; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.56–17.05; P=0.007). Adjusting for the 
confounders that significantly differed in Table 1 (pregnancy 
age, body mass index [both at baseline and during follow-up], 
free fatty acid level, and neonatal weight) slightly increased 
the OR (OR, 6.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.79–23.92; 
P=0.004). However, patients in the moderate-U-shaped DBP 
trajectory did not have a statistically increased OR for having 
MetS. To examine the associations between a single measure-
ment of BP, the participants were reclassified by diastolic BP 
(≥80 or <80 mm Hg) and SBP (≥120 or <120 mm Hg) levels 
at term. Compared with the patients without an elevated DBP 
level, the OR for postpartum MetS in patients with DBP pre-
hypertension at term was significantly increased and remained 
statistically significant after adjusting for confounders (OR, 
2.94; 95% confidence interval, 1.19–7.25; P=0.019). Notably, 
there was no association between SBP-derived, MAP-derived, 
and mid-BP–derived trajectory memberships, or SBP prehy-
pertension at term, and postpartum MetS (Tables S1–S3).

Because the elevated-J-shaped DBP trajectory and DBP 
prehypertension at term were both associated with postpartum 
MetS, we sought to examine the associations between these 
2 DBP categories and individual cardiometabolic risk factors 
during follow-up. Binary logistic regression analyses (Table 
S4) revealed that the elevated-J-shaped DBP trajectory was 
more likely to be associated with FPG and triglycerides levels, 
whereas an elevated DBP at term was more likely to be asso-
ciated with increased waist circumference, elevated BP level, 
and reduced HDL-C level. In addition, when we combined 
the low-J-shaped and the moderated-U-shaped groups into 1 
group and used the κ statistic to test the agreement between 
the elevated-J-shaped DBP trajectory and the elevated DBP at 
term, the level of agreement was considered fair, with κ=0.22 
(criteria for κ value: poor if κ≤0.20; fair if κ=0.21–0.40; mod-
erate if κ=0.41–0.60; substantial if κ=0.61–0.80; and very 
good if κ>0.80).34 These results suggested that although the 
elevated-J-shaped DBP trajectory and DBP prehypertension 
at term both predicted postpartum MetS, the individuals in 
these 2 groups were heterogeneous.
To construct a prediction model for postpartum MetS, the 
receiver operator characteristic curve analyses showed that 
among the MetS definition–related components obtained at 
term (waist circumference is not applicable at this time), only 
FPG, triglycerides, HDL-C, and DBP trajectories had an AUC 
with statistical significance (Table S5). Because HDL-C and 
triglycerides were inversely correlated (Pearson r=−0.309; 
P<0.001), 
we 
thus 
built 
2 
models 
(FPG+DBP 
trajectories+HDL-
C and FPG+DBP trajectories+triglycerides). Although these 2 
models had similar discrimination capacities (c-statistic, 0.755 
versus 0.764, for HDL-C and triglycerides models, respec-
tively), the model incorporating HDL-C had poor calibration 
(Hosmer–Lemeshow test χ2, 10.55; P=0.005; Table S6 and 
Figure S4). Consequently, the model incorporating FPG, DBP 
trajectories, and triglycerides provides the optimal prediction 
of postpartum MetS, with clinically acceptable discrimina-
tion (c-statistic, 0.764; 95% confidence interval, 0.674–0.855; 
P<0.001) and calibration (Hosmer–Lemeshow test χ2, 1.85; 
P=0.764; Table 3; Figure 3) capacities.
Finally, we examined the changes in the MetS definition–
related components during follow-up. As shown in Figure 4, 
compared with the MetS-related components at term, HDL-C 
underwent a decreasing trend with no significant difference 
between MetS and non-MetS participants. Despite a similar 
decreasing trend in triglycerides level, the reduction in MetS 
participants was smaller in magnitude than their non-MetS 
peers. The level of FPG was significantly increased during 
follow-up, with more obvious elevation in MetS participants. 
Notably, the relative changes in HOMA-IR, DBP, and SBP 
showed opposing trends, with increasing trends in MetS par-
ticipants and decreasing trends in non-MetS participants.

Discussion
Despite accumulating evidence demonstrating the associa-
tion between HDP and future CVD, the association between 
antepartum prehypertension and postpartum cardiovascular 
risk has not been investigated. Using latent class growth 
modeling from multiple BP measurements obtained through-
out the course of pregnancy, we identified 3 distinctive DBP 
trajectory groups during normotensive pregnancies associ-
ated with postpartum MetS. The elevated-J-shaped trajec-
tory group (13.2% of total cohort), which is characterized by 
the highest DBP and SBP levels throughout pregnancy and 
a steep rise during the third trimester, with mean DBP and 
SBP levels within the range of prehypertension at term, had 
an ≈5-fold increase in developing postpartum MetS com-
pared with the low-J-shaped group. Moreover, incorporating 
the DBP trajectory, but not the DBP prehypertension defined 
by a single measurement at term, with glucose and triglyc-
erides provided a prediction model with clinically accept-
able discrimination (AUC of 0.7–0.835) and good calibration. 
Thus, our data suggest that prehypertension identified by 
DBP trajectories throughout pregnancy is an independent 
risk factor for predicting postpartum MetS in normotensive 
pregnant women
Interestingly, we did not observe statistical associations 
between the other BP-derived trajectory groups (SBP, MAP, 
and mid-BP) and postpartum MetS, presumably because of 
the more dramatic impact of pregnancy on DBP that is induced 
by alterations in systemic vascular resistance.36 In fact, DBP 
has been shown to play a larger role in coronary heart disease 
risk among young to middle-aged adults.37 Notably, although 
both DBP trajectories and a single DBP reading at term could 
identify a subset of women with higher risk of future MetS, 
the participants classified by these 2 approaches were hetero-
geneous. Moreover, a single DBP measurement did not play a 
statistically important role in the prediction model of postpar-
tum MetS. In recent years, the emerging application of mul-
tiple BP measurement-derived trajectories across the lifespan 
has provided insights for identifying novel means of prevent-
ing future cardiovascular risk.30,32,38 Therefore, considering 
the dynamic nature of BP during pregnancy and the impact of 
seasonality on pregnancy BP levels,39 BP trajectories that are 
an entire pregnancy course-dependent systemic approach have 
potential advantages over the fragmented, single BP measure-
ment in terms of accuracy and reproducibility. Because all preg-
nant women should have at least 4 antenatal care assessments 
according to the new World Health Organization antenatal care 
model,40 full utilization of these serial BP data would thus pro-
vide additional information for future risk stratification.
There is an expanding burden of cardiometabolic risk in 
women, and it is a major contributor to CVD both in China

and in worldwide.41,42 Approximately 80% of women in devel-
oped countries and 90% in developing countries will have at 
least 1 pregnancy in their life time.43 Pregnancy is character-
ized by a cascade of physiological changes that poses a sub-
stantial burden on BP regulation, as well as on glucose and 
lipid metabolism. Thus, pregnancy perfectly unmasks defects 
in BP regulation when the body is dealing with hemodynamic 
alterations. In addition, the pregnancy-induced resetting of 
glucose and lipid homeostasis, as manifested by decreased 
insulin sensitivity and increased circulating triglycerides, 
mimic the pathological alterations observed in MetS.44 Recent 
data showed that in addition to gestational diabetes mellitus, 
even mild forms of dysglycemia during pregnancy represent a 
maternal phenotype of increased subsequent cardiometabolic 
risk.45 Our data revealed that the MetS participants underwent 
a progressive worsening of glucose metabolism from enroll-
ment at gestational age of 11+0 to 13+6 weeks, to at term, and 
to ≈1.6 years postpartum. This finding is consistent with a 
recent report that β-cell function declines within the first year 
postpartum.46 Moreover, our finding that HOMA-IR indepen-
dently predicts postpartum BP level further supports insulin 
resistance as the underlying pathophysiological mechanism 
contributing to elevated BP level.
Our study has limitations that need to be mentioned. First, 
the follow-up rate in our study was ≈60%, which is generally 
regarded as a low rate for cohort studies. However, our cohort 
was drawn from a normotensive and uncomplicated popula-
tion, and patients who are completely or nearly asymptomatic 
are less likely to be self-motivated for long-term follow-up. 
The low follow-up rate is a common issue for postpartum 
women; even among preeclamptic women with continuous 
medical coverage, only 57% of subjects attended a primary 
care visit within 1 year after delivery.47 By applying strict 
enrollment criteria to exclude a potentially mobile population 
of young families, our study had a higher follow-up rate than 
previously published studies on pregnant women.48,49 Second, 
because our study is based on the Chinese population and 
because of the ethnic variation in the individual components 
of MetS,50 the generalizability of our results to other ethnic 
populations warrants future analysis. Third, we did not col-
lect data on self-reported smoking in our study, which is a 
well-known confounder for BP changes during pregnancy.51 
Because the smoking rate among Chinese men is ≈70%,52 
future work is warranted to examine the potential impact of 
passive smoking exposure using information provided by 
serum nicotine measurements. Fourth, as a common limitation 
in pregnant women, the lack of preconception information 
may contribute to the uncertainty of whether the elevated BP 
level in a subset of pregnant women is because of failed stress 
response to pregnancy or because of preconception disorders. 
However, we performed a thorough screening at baseline 
(11+0–13+6 weeks) including glucose and lipid profiles, which 
could minimize the impact of this limitation. Fifth, external 
validation in an independent cohort is necessary, and the cur-
rent DBP trajectories and related prediction model cannot be 
widely implemented.
Our study has the following strengths. We used a new sta-
tistical approach, latent class growth modeling, also known as 
group-based trajectory modeling, which was recently developed 
to identify clusters of individuals after a similar progression of a 
specific measurement over age or time.26 This method has been 
utilized and reported in recent longitudinal studies involving 
multiple BP measurements.30,32,53 To our knowledge, our report 
is the first to use this method to delineate BP patterns during 
pregnancy. Because BP measurement is a part of a routine pre-
natal check-up, our findings provide evidence demonstrating a 
novel method to cost-effectively estimate future cardiovascu-
lar risk among women. Moreover, future work is warranted 
to examine the potential role of a more intensive BP manage-
ment strategy during pregnancy, which has been recently dem-
onstrated to clinically benefit a nonpregnant population in the 
Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) study.54
Early identification of metabolic risk factors and the imple-
mentation of lifestyle modifications may help delay the onset 
of CVD that may present 20 to 30 years after delivery and 
consequently improve women’s health status and quality of

life. Although a BP ≥140/90 mm Hg is a well-known risk fac-
tor for cardiovascular risk during pregnancy and postpartum, 
our findings suggest that individuals with DBP prehyperten-
sion identified by multiple BP measurement-based trajectory 
modeling throughout pregnancy are at an increased risk of 
postpartum MetS. Our study highlights the potential role of 
antepartum prehypertension in postpartum cardiovascular risk 
stratification and fortifies the emerging concept that the indi-
vidualized mapping of multiple BP measurements over time 
may provide additional information on an individual’s cardio-
vascular risk status.
Perspectives
The prognostic role of prehypertension (120–139/80–89 
mm Hg) during pregnancy for postpartum cardiovascular risk 
is unclear. In this study, we prospectively evaluated the rela-
tionship between antepartum BP trajectories and the occur-
rence of postpartum MetS and demonstrated that the DBP 
trajectory within the range of prehypertension is an indepen-
dent risk factor predicting postpartum MetS. This finding 
highlights the multiple BP measurement-dependent trajecto-
ries as a cost-effective strategy to identify subgroups of young 
women for whom early cardiovascular risk factor surveillance 
may be warranted.

What Is New?
• The exposure to prehypertension during pregnancy, as identified by 
diastolic blood pressure (BP) trajectories using multiple diastolic BP 
measurements, is an independent risk factor for developing postpartum 
metabolic syndrome.
• The incorporation of diastolic BP trajectories with the levels of glucose 
and triglycerides at term provides a novel prediction model for postpar-
tum metabolic syndrome.
What Is Relevant?
• Our data highlight the need for the reevaluation of the pregnancy-specific 
BP range using multiple BP measurements for postpartum cardiovascu-
lar risk stratification.
Summary
Normotensive pregnant women with prehypertension identified 
by multiple diastolic BP measurement-dependent trajectories 
throughout pregnancy have an increased risk of developing post-
partum metabolic syndrome.
