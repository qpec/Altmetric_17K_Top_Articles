IMPORTANCE Predictions of long-term survival and functional outcomes influence decision
making for critically ill patients, yet little is known regarding their accuracy.
OBJECTIVE To determine the discriminative accuracy of intensive care unit (ICU) physicians
and nurses in predicting 6-month patient mortality and morbidity, including ambulation,
toileting, and cognition.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective cohort study conducted in 5 ICUs in 3
hospitals in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and enrolling patients who spent at least 3 days in the
ICU from October 2013 until May 2014 and required mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, or
both. These patients’attending physicians and bedside nurses were also enrolled. Follow-up
was completed in December 2014.

 P
roviding prognostic guidance has long been a core phy-
sician responsibility1 and is an essential part of shared
decision making, which requires integrating prognos-
tic assessments with patients’values and preferences.2 Prior
studies have shown that intensive care unit (ICU) physicians
are moderately accurate in predicting in-hospital mortality,3,4
but evaluations of ICU physicians’abilities to predict longer-
term mortality and functional outcomes have been limited to
patients who require long-term mechanical ventilation.5 Fur-
thermore, although nurses are not specifically charged with
formulating and conveying prognostic judgments, many do so
given the greater time they spend with patients, and there are
no data regarding their accuracy.
Clinicians’abilities to discriminate between patients who
will or will not develop unfavorable outcomes other than mor-
tality are important for several reasons. First, knowledge of fu-
ture function may be very important to ICU patients,6 their
families, and clinicians.7 This is particularly true as increas-
ing numbers of patients survive the ICU but experience long-
term impairments in cognition8 and overall function.9,10 Sec-
ond, multidisciplinary family meetings commonly focus on
function and quality of life.11 Third, predictions of future func-
tion may influence clinician behavior, as physicians are more
likely to offer the withdrawal of life support when they be-
lieve the patient will experience future dysfunction.12 Fourth,
recent qualitative work has highlighted a central tension for
ICUclinicians“betweentheirprofessionalresponsibilitytodis-
cusslikelyfunctionaloutcomesvsuncertaintyabouttheirabil-
ity to predict those outcomes for an individual patient.
”13 This
study sought to determine how well ICU physicians and nurses
can determine which patients recently admitted to an ICU and
requiring life support will have died or will experience unfa-
vorable functional outcomes 6 months later.
Methods
Study Population
This was a prospective cohort study in 5 ICUs (3 medical, 2 sur-
gical) in 3 hospitals in the University of Pennsylvania Health
System that vary in their levels of specialization and incorpo-
ration of trainees into patient care. Recruitment occurred from
October 2013 through May 2014, and written or oral in-
formed consent was obtained from physicians, nurses, pa-
tients, and surrogates. Consent for patients was sought from
surrogates when patients lacked capacity. The University of
Pennsylvania institutional review board approved this study.
Patients were eligible to be enrolled from their third
through sixth ICU day if they had received mechanical venti-
lation for more than 48 consecutive hours, vasoactive infu-
sions for more than 24 consecutive hours, or both. Patients
were enrolled 3 to 6 days after ICU admission because guide-
lines recommend that family conferences occur early in an ICU
admission.14,15 The use of either vasoactive infusions or me-
chanical ventilation was required to target a population of pa-
tients who were sufficiently sick that they would require
ICU-level care in essentially all hospitals. Patients receiving
ICU-levelcareforfewerthan3dayswereexcludedbecauseout-
comes among such patients are often readily foreseeable and
because such patients may be less likely to benefit from fam-
ily discussions and prognostic assessments.16 Other exclu-
sion criteria are listed in eAppendix 1 in the Supplement.
Recruited clinicians were the patient’
s attending physi-
cian and primary bedside registered nurse on the day the pa-
tient was enrolled. Physicians were required to have been the
patient’
sattendingofrecordforatleast2calendardays.Nurses
were only required to have 1 day of contact, owing to greater
variability in their daily schedule and more frequent contact
with patients on a given day.
Clinicians’Predictions
Clinicians were asked to predict 6 outcomes that were easily
understood by patients, surrogates, and physicians during
pilot testing (eTable 1 in the Supplement). These outcomes
were hospital survival plus 5 outcomes at 6 months from the
time of study enrollment: survival, return to original
residence,17 ability to toilet independently,18 ability to ambu-
late up 10 stairs independently,19 and ability to “remember
most things, think clearly, and solve day-to-day problems”
(ie, cognitive function).20 For toileting, ambulation, and cog-
nition, clinicians were asked to make predictions conditional
on the assumption that the patient would be alive at 6 months.
Clinicians were required to provide a dichotomous predic-
tion of whether the outcome would be achieved and to then
state their confidence in each prediction using a 5-point
Likert scale ranging from 1 (not confident at all) to 5 (very
confident) (eAppendix 2 in the Supplement). Predictions were
made within 24 hours of patient enrollment.
Patient Data Collection
Baseline patient information was collected prospectively from
the electronic health record and through in-person or tele-
phone interviews with patients or surrogates. The clinical vari-
ables assessed included prior physical and cognitive func-
tion,medicalcomorbidities,andAcutePhysiologyandChronic
HealthEvaluationIII(APACHEIII)scores.21Interviewswithpa-
tients or surrogates were used to determine patients’base-
linefunction(ie,toileting,ambulation,andcognition)andplace
Key Points
Question What is the discriminative accuracy of physicians and
nurses in predicting 6-month mortality and functional outcomes
of critically ill patients?
Findings In this prospective cohort study of 303 critically ill
patients, physicians most accurately predicted 6-month mortality
(positive likelihood ratio, 5.91; negative likelihood ratio, 0.41) and
least accurately predicted cognition (positive likelihood ratio, 2.36;
negative likelihood ratio, 0.75). Nurses’predictions were similar or
less accurate.
Meaning Intensive care unit physicians’and nurses’discriminative
accuracy in predicting 6-month outcomes of critically ill patients
varied depending on the outcome being predicted and confidence
of the predictor, but further research is needed to better
understand how clinicians derive prognostic estimates of
long-term outcomes.

 of residence, using using scales identical to those ultimately
used for assessments during follow-up at 6 months. Contact
information for patients and surrogates was obtained during
enrollment.
6-Month Patient Data Collection
In-hospital mortality was determined by reviewing the elec-
tronic health record. If patients were not confirmed to be dead
at 6 months, a trained research assistant unaware of the cli-
nicians’baseline predictions attempted to contact survivors
via telephone or email to determine the patient’
s vital status
and function. If initial attempts to contact the patient were un-
successful, attempts to contact both the patient and the sur-
rogate occurred twice weekly, and whomever was contacted
firstwasinterviewedusingastandardizedscript.Patientswere
considered lost to follow-up after 5 failed contact attempts.
Statistical Analysis
The discriminative accuracy of predictions was derived from
2 × 2 tables (eTable 2 in the Supplement). All patients were in-
cluded in analyses of in-hospital mortality, 6-month mortal-
ity, and return to original place of residence; 6-month survi-
vors were included in analyses of ambulation, toileting, and
cognition. Patients’and surrogates’reports of 6-month out-
comes were considered equivalent.
For each outcome, 8 operating characteristics were calcu-
lated separately for physicians’and nurses’predictions: sen-
sitivity, specificity, C statistic, positive predictive value,
negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio (LR), nega-
tive LR, and diagnostic odds ratio.22 The primary results are
presented as LRs and C statistics because these combine both
sensitivity and specificity and are minimally influenced by
outcome prevalence. A higher positive LR indicates greater
discriminative accuracy in predicting adverse outcomes, with
positive LR values of 5 to 10 yielding “modest shifts” in the
probability of an event and values greater than 10 yielding
“conclusive changes.
”23 A lower negative LR indicates greater
discriminative accuracy in predicting favorable outcomes,
with negative LR values of 0.1 to 0.2 yielding “modest shifts”
in the probability of an event and values less than 0.1 yielding
“conclusive changes.
”23
Agreement between physicians and nurses was calcu-
lated using unweighted κ scores. To evaluate differences in cli-
nicians’optimism or pessimism, the McNemar test was used
to evaluate dyads of predictions made by physicians and
nurses.Discriminativeaccuracybetweenphysiciansandnurses
was compared using C statistics for each of the 6 outcomes.24
Four secondary analyses were specified a priori. First, con-
fident predictions, defined as those rated as a 4 or 5 by clini-
cians on the Likert scale, were compared with nonconfident
predictionsusingCstatisticsforcorrelateddata.25Theseanaly-
ses were preformed separately for physicians and nurses. Sec-
ond, operating characteristics were measured for predictions
for which the physician and nurse were concordant and both
clinicians were confident. Third, LRs for physician and nurse
predictions of 6-month mortality were compared across quar-
tiles of patient’
s APACHE III scores. Fourth, C statistics for dis-
criminating hospital mortality and 6-month outcomes were

Results
Patient and Clinician Characteristics
Among 340 eligible patients (or their surrogates) approached
for enrollment, 303 (89%) consented to participate (eFigure 1
in the Supplement). Patients had a median age of 62 years (in-
terquartile range, 53-71), 173 (57%) were men, and 190 (63%)
and 113 (37%) were admitted to medical and surgical ICUs, re-
spectively.Priortotheircriticalillness,283patients(94%)lived
at home, 243 (81%) could ambulate up 10 stairs indepen-
dently, 267 (88%) could toilet independently, and 249 (83%)
had normal cognition (Table 1). Outcomes at 6 months were
verified for 299 patients (99%). Of the 169 patients (57%) con-
firmed to be alive at 6 months, functional outcomes were veri-
fied by patients for 87 (51%) and by surrogates for 82 (49%).
Forty-seven physicians and 128 nurses contributed pre-
dictionsforatleast1patient.Almosthalfofpatients(47%)were
enrolledonICUday3,andtheremainderwereenrolledondays
4 to 6. At the time of the interview, 84% of physicians and 90%
of nurses reported having already thought about patients’fu-
ture morbidity, but only 39% and 31%, respectively, reported
having discussed this with the patient or surrogate (Table 2).
Overall Predictions
Among physicians, 95% CIs around all 6 positive and nega-
tiveLRstatisticsexcludedthenullvalueof1.00,indicatingbet-
ter-than-chanceprediction(Table3).Similarly,95%CIsaround
all 6 C statistics excluded the chance value of 0.5 (Table 4). For
physicians, the best positive LR values were for 6-month mor-
tality(5.91[95%CI,3.74-9.32])andtoileting(6.00[95%CI,3.18-
11.30]), and the best negative LR was for 6-month mortality
(0.41 [95% CI, 0.33-0.52]). For nurses, the best positive LR was
for in-hospital mortality (4.71 [95% CI, 2.94-7.56]), and the best
negative LR values were for toileting (0.48 [95% CI, 0.30-
0.78]) and ambulating up 10 stairs (0.48 [95% CI, 0.31-0.74]).
Thefulloperatingcharacteristicsandcrude2 × 2tablesforphy-
sicians and nurses are reported in eTables 3 through 6 in the
Supplement.
Physicians and nurses had fair to moderate agreement27
when predicting outcomes for the same patient, with κ scores
rangingfrom0.32to0.51(eTable7intheSupplement).Inthese
paired assessments, physicians were more optimistic than
nurses in predicting return to original residence (P = .002) and
toileting independently (P < .001) (eTables 7 and 8 in the
Supplement). Physicians and nurses were equally accurate in
predictingalloutcomesexceptfor6-monthmortality,forwhich
physicians’predictions were significantly better (C statistic,
0.76 [95% CI, 0.72-0.81] for physicians vs 0.69 [95% CI, 0.64-
0.74] for nurses; P = .02) (Table 3).
Confident, Concordant, and Stratified Predictions
Physicians were confident (rated a 4 or 5 on the Likert scale)
in 41% to 55% of their predictions across the 6 outcomes, while
nurses were confident in 44% to 57% of their predictions.
(Table 4, Figure). When physicians were confident, their pre-
dictions of 6-month survival, return to original residence,
toileting independently, and ambulating up 10 stairs were
significantly more accurate than when they were not confi-
dent (Table 4). For example, physicians’confident predic-
tions of 6-month survival had excellent LRs (positive LR, 33.00
[95% CI, 8.34-130.63]; negative LR, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.09-0.35])
and discrimination (C statistic, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.84-0.96])

 Nurses’confident predictions of 6-month survival and re-
turntooriginalresidenceweresignificantlymoreaccuratethan
their nonconfident predictions of these outcomes (Table 4;
eTables 11 and 12 and eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
Across outcomes, physicians and nurses were both con-
cordant and confident for 22% to 33% of predictions. Discrimi-
native accuracy of these concordant and confident predic-
tions was typically excellent, especially for 6-month mortality
(positive LR, 40.35 [95% CI, 5.73-284.28], negative LR, 0.18
[95% CI, 0.06- 0.50]) and toileting (positive LR, 15.75 [95% CI,
4.04-58.94]; negative LR, 0.11 [95% CI, 0.02-0.68]) (eFigure
3 and eTable 13 in the Supplement).
Physicians’and nurses’LRs for predicting 6-month sur-
vival were generally similar across all quartiles of illness se-
verity as measured by APACHE III scores and excluded the null
value of 1.0 in all cases (eFigure 4 in the Supplement). Rela-
tivetopredictionmodelsforall6outcomesderivedusingclini-
cal variables, including APACHE III scores21 and the Func-
tional Comorbidity Index28 available close to the time of ICU
admission, models that included these clinical variables plus
physicians’and nurses’predictions and levels of confidence
generally had significantly better C statistics (eTable 14 in the
Supplement).
Discussion
Among a diverse cohort of critically ill patients, ICU physi-
cians’and nurses’abilities to discriminate between those who
would or would not survive or experience unfavorable func-
tional outcomes 6 months later varied by the outcome being
predicted and whether physicians and nurses were confident
or concordant in their predictions. However, these clinicians’
predictions were often sufficient to change the probability
of future outcomes by more than diagnostic tests commonly
used in clinical medicine29 and added significantly to the

 discriminative accuracy of prediction models obtained using
APACHE scores and other clinical variables.
Despite descriptions of functional outcomes for specific
cohorts of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome,30
prolonged mechanical ventilation,9,31 and sepsis,32 clinicians
struggle to apply these population estimates to individual
patients.13 Several specific findings in the present study may
help ICU clinicians understand the power and limitations of
their prognostic judgements.
First, physicians’aggregate predictions of in-hospital mor-
tality, 6-month mortality, return to original residence by 6
months, and cognitive and functional outcomes at 6 months
were all better than chance but were typically modest for un-
selected patients. Similar results were found among nurses,
except that their predictions of cognition were no better than
chance. Thus, when relaying such predictions at the bedside,
it is important that clinicians acknowledge their uncertainty.
Most family members not only desire prognostic guidance
from ICU clinicians but also appreciate that some uncertainty
is inevitable.33 In our study, roughly one-third of physicians
and nurses reported giving prognostic estimates to the fam-
ily prior to a patient’
s enrollment in the study.
Second, for the approximately one-half of general ICU pa-
tients for whom ICU physicians and nurses may form confi-
dent predictions, the discriminative accuracy of these predic-
tions appears to improve considerably. Caution in interpreting
this result is required because the CIs surrounding the LRs for
confident predictions are often wide owing to the smaller
sample sizes. However, it is notable that few clinical diagnos-
tic tests achieve positive LRs as high as those estimated for sev-
eral confident physician predictions.29 Furthermore, when
ICU physicians and nurses agreed in their predictions and both
clinicians were confident, the discrimination was typically
maximized. Thus, ICU physicians should consider both their
ownconfidenceandtheiragreement,orlackthereof,withbed-
side nurses in deciding how to frame their prognostic judg-
ments to patients and surrogates.
Third, clinician discrimination varied among the 6 pre-
dicted outcomes. Clinicians were most accurate in predicting
6-month mortality and toileting independence and least ac-
curate in predicting cognition. Prior evaluations of clinicians’
abilities to predict in-hospital mortality have shown that cli-
nicians often do better than quantitative models.3 However,
such results may be attributable to a self-fulfilling prophecy
if clinicians more commonly recommend withdrawal of
life support for patients they expect to die.12 The current re-
sults regarding 6-month outcomes may be less susceptible
tosuchself-fulfillingprophecies.Furthermore,physicianspre-
dicted only 29 of the 69 in-hospital deaths in this cohort.
Thus, even if self-fulfilling prophecies influenced the results,
the overall effect appears to be small. Regardless, given the im-
portance of longer-term survival to patients and surrogates,
as well as clinicians’aptitude for predicting this outcome,
it may be reasonable for clinicians to focus on 6-month mor-
tality and functional outcomes in discussions with patients
and families.
The finding that clinicians perform poorly in predicting fu-
turecognitionamongICUsurvivorsisconsistentwithpriorwork
showing that even validated measures of cognition assessed at
the time of hospital discharge do not predict long-term cogni-
tive sequlae.34 Although cognitive dysfunction is common
among survivors8 and is important to patients and caregivers,
the current data suggest the need for caution when discussing
individual patients’risks for future cognitive dysfunction.
This study has several strengths. Outcome data were ob-
tained at 6 months for 99% of enrolled patients, thereby

 minimizing the chance of bias due to missing data. Although
all patients were recruited from the same health system, they
emanated from 3 medical and 2 surgical ICUs using different
staffing models and trainee involvement at 3 different hospi-
tals. Also, the diversity of critical illness represented among
enrolled patients and the requirement for only brief expo-
sure to life support augment the generalizability of the re-

 these predictions. It is possible that when examining groups
of patients, clinicians more frequently and confidently pre-
dict unfavorable outcomes for those more likely to experi-
encethem,yetstillgrosslyunderestimateoroverestimatethese
probabilities. Future work is therefore needed to determine
how well calibrated clinicians are in their predictions. Such
studies might ask clinicians to rate the probabilities of future
outcomes rather than eliciting dichotomous judgements and
confidence ratings, as in the present study.
Second, these data apply only to predictions made
on ICU days 3 to 6, which may be prior to when some clini-
cians were comfortable predicting patients’outcomes. How-
ever, guidelines14 and systematic reviews15 recommend con-
ducting multidisciplinary meetings with families by either ICU
day 3 or 5. Thus, these data apply to information that may be
conveyed during recommended family meetings.
A third limitation is that most study outcomes were veri-
fied through patient or surrogate reports by telephone. Al-
though these patient- and caregiver-reported outcomes may
differ from objectively measured physical or cognitive out-
comes, this study intentionally chose to measure perceived
cognitiveorphysicaldysfunction,becausesuchoutcomesmay
be as or more important to patients and families as objec-
tively measured outcomes.35 Additionally, it is possible that
patients and surrogates may respond differently to these out-
come measures. This cannot be ascertained reliably because
ofpotentialdifferencesbetweenpatientswhorespondedthem-
selves and those for whom surrogates responded.
Conclusions
ICU physicians’and nurses’discriminative accuracy in pre-
dicting 6-month outcomes of critically ill patients varied
depending on the outcome being predicted and confidence
of the predictors. Further research is needed to better under-
stand how clinicians derive prognostic estimates of long-
term outcomes.
