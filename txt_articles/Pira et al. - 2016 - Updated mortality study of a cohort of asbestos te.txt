Introduction
The incidence of mesothelioma rises as function of the 
third or fourth power of time since first asbestos exposure 
(latency) [12], after taking into account time since ces-
sation of exposure. The other determinants of mesothelioma 
incidence are average exposure to asbestos (linear relation-
ship), and type of asbestos, with stronger potency of 
amphiboles than chrysotile [3]. The influence of other 
time- 
related aspects such as age at first exposure and 
duration of exposure appears to be largely or totally 
explained by latency [12]. These models linking asbestos 
exposure to mesothelioma incidence have been developed 
and validated mainly on the basis of results for the pleural 
form of the disease, since most available cohort studies 
include a small number of peritoneal mesothelioma [2]. 
Asbestos is also a cause of lung cancer, and cumulative 
asbestos exposure appears to be the main determinant of 
lung cancer incidence, together with the prevalence of 
tobacco smoking, because of the interaction between the 
two risk factors [3].
We reported the mortality follow- 
up to 2004 of a cohort 
of heavily exposed asbestos textile workers employed 
between 1946 and 1984, in which we observed 315 cancer 
deaths compared to 153.9 expected (standardized mortality 
ratio [SMR] 2.11; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.89–2.35), 
including 39 deaths from peritoneal cancer, 36 deaths 
from pleural cancer, and 109 deaths from lung cancer 
[14, 15]. In that analysis there was no difference in the 
SMR of pleural and peritoneal cancer between workers 
who had stopped exposure below age 30, and those who 
had continued exposure after age 40 [15].

Abstract
Limited information is available on risk of peritoneal mesothelioma after asbestos 
exposure, and in general on the risk of cancer after cessation of asbestos ex-
posure. We updated to 2013 the follow- 
up of a cohort of 1083 female and 894 
male textile workers with heavy asbestos exposure (up to 100 fb/mL), often for 
short periods. A total of 1019 deaths were observed, corresponding to a stand-
ardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 1.68 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.57–1.78). 
SMRs were 29.1 (95% CI: 21.5–38.6) for peritoneal cancer, 2.96 (95% CI: 
2.50–3.49) for lung cancer, 33.7 (95% CI: 25.7–43.4) for pleural cancer, and 
3.03 (95% CI: 1.69–4.99) for ovarian cancer. For pleural and peritoneal cancer, 
there was no consistent pattern of risk in relation to time since last exposure, 
whereas for lung cancer there was an indication of a decline in risk after 25 years 
since last exposure. The findings of this unique cohort provide novel data for 
peritoneal cancer, indicating that – as for pleural cancer – the excess risk does 
not decline up to several decades after cessation of exposure.

Mortality of Asbestos Textile Workers
This cohort is unique since it contains a relatively large 
number of workers, in particular women, who experienced 
short- 
term, high- 
level exposure to asbestos. As discussed 
in detail in previous publications [14, 15], various types 
of asbestos were used in the factory, including crocidolite. 
Environmental exposure data were available between 1968 
and 1977 [14, 17]. Average exposure levels as high as 
100 fb/mL were measured in the opening and carding 
departments in the late 1960s; in the early 1970s average 
exposure levels were in the range 5–25 fb/mL, and in 
the late 1970s the average level was 2 fb/mL or less in 
all departments [14, 17].
The large number of deaths from peritoneal cancer is 
also an unusual finding. We decided therefore to update 
the follow- 
up of this same cohort to 2013, aiming for 
separate analyses for pleural and peritoneal cancer, as well 
as lung cancer, with focus on the pattern of mortality 
following cessation of exposure.
Materials and Methods
Detailed information on the cohort is provided in previ-
ous reports [14, 15]. In brief, the cohort includes 1083 
women and 894 men who had worked in an asbestos 
textile factory sited in Northern Italy, between 1946 and 
1984. The main type of asbestos used in the plant was 
chrysotile, but crocidolite was also present, although the 
relative proportion of the two types of fibers over time 
is not precisely known. The current analysis includes 11 
additional subjects as compared to the previous reports, 
who have been found to fulfill the inclusion criteria. For 
the present analyses, follow- 
up was extended to November 
2013; subjects were censored when they reached 85 years 
of age, because of the possibility of misclassification of 
cause of death in the elderly. Therefore, end of follow- 
up 
was defined as date of death, date of last contact, date 
of 85th birthday, or November 30, 2013, whichever occurred 
first.
We obtained employment data from personnel records 
at the factory, and ascertained vital status and causes of 
death through population registers and death certificates 
from local authorities. Subjects lost to follow- 
up were 
censored at the date of last contact. Though complete 
information on occupational history was not collected, 
any available data on asbestos- 
related jobs outside the 
factory were recorded, leading to the identification of 120 
(6.1%) subjects with exposure to asbestos previous to the 
hire in the factory. Therefore, we conducted a sensitivity 
analysis excluding these subjects. We calculated several 
time- 
related exposure variables, including time since first 
exposure (difference between date of hire and end of 
follow- 
up), duration of employment (difference between 
date of hire and date of last employment), and time since 
cessation of exposure (difference between data of last 
employment and end of follow- 
up).
We computed expected numbers of deaths using the 
national death rates during 1955- 
1980 [9], and the regional 
rates [1, 5] from 1981 onwards. Since national death rates 
were not available before 1955, the 1955–1959 death rates 
were applied to period 1946–1954. We computed the 
SMRs of selected cancers and of total mortality, as the 
ratio of observed and expected numbers of deaths. The 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were based 
on the Poisson distribution of observed deaths [4].
In addition, we fitted Poisson regression models to 
estimate mortality rate ratios for age at first employment, 
duration of employment, time since first employment, 
and time since last employment, after adjustment for sex 
and age [4]. Age and the exposure variables were intro-
duced in the regression models as time- 
varying covariates; 
age was included as continuous variable to limit the 
number of parameters, and the addition of a term for 
age2 significantly increased the goodness of it of the mod-
els. To assess the presence of linear trends across levels 
of ordinal variables, we evaluated the Wald chi- 
square 
statistic after fitting regression models including a linear 
term for the covariate of interest.
Results
The present analyses include a total of 74,126 person- 
years of observation (45,769 among women and 28,357 
among men). The distribution of subjects and person- 
years by demographic and exposure characteristics is 
shown in Table S1. Overall, 920 (46.5%) subjects were 
alive at the end of the follow- 
up, 1019 (51.5%) had died 
and 38 (1.9%) emigrated or were lost to follow- 
up. Cause 
of death was unknown for 48 (4.7%) of deceased subjects. 
Table 1 gives the SMRs in women, men and in both 
sexes combined. The SMR for all causes was 1.68 (95% 
CI: 1.57–1.78). Significant excesses mortality were observed 
for cancers of the peritoneum (SMR 9.1; 95% CI: 21.5–
38.6), lung (SMR 2.96; 95% CI: 2.50–3.49), pleura (SMR 
33.7; 95% CI: 25.7–43.4), and ovary (SMR 3.03; 95% 
CI: 1.69–4.99). The increased mortality was more pro-
nounced in women than men. An increased in mortality 
from esophageal cancer, based on a small number of 
deaths, was present in women but not in men.
Table 2 gives the observed and expected numbers of 
deaths from peritoneal, lung, and pleural cancer according 
to time since last exposure, approximated by time since 
last employment. For pleural and peritoneal, there was no 
consistent pattern of SMRs, and no evidence of a decrease, 
in relation to time since last exposure. For lung cancer, 
the SMR declined after 25 years since last exposure. We 
repeated the latter analyses using different categories of time

since last exposure (<15 years, 15 to <30 years and ≥30 years). 
The SMRs were higher in the category 15 to <30 years 
since last exposure than in the category ≥30 years (SMRs 
45.1 and 26.8 for peritoneal cancer, 41.4 and 33.5 for pleural 
cancer, and 3.42 and 2.55 for lung cancer). SMRs according 
to time since first employment are reported in Table S2. 
SMRs for pleural cancers increased up to 40 years since 
first employment; in the case of ovarian cancer, the SMRs 
increased monotonically with time since first employment, 
although the number of deaths was small in several catego-
ries; no trend according to time since first employment 
was suggested for peritoneal and lung cancer.
Table 3 shows the results of the multivariate Poisson 
regression analysis of risk of lung cancer, pleural cancer, 
and peritoneal cancer. Duration of employment was the 
exposure variable with the strongest association with risk 
of lung cancer, and a decrease in risk was suggested with 
time since last employment. In the case of pleural cancer, 
an association was found with time since first employ-
ment and time since last employment, but not with dura-
tion of employment. The results for peritoneal cancer 
suggest an association with duration of employment, as 
well as an increase in risk with time since first employ-
ment and time since last employment. Among workers

Mortality of Asbestos Textile Workers
employed for less than 1 year, there were 10 deaths from 
peritoneal cancer, 31 deaths from lung cancer, and 16 
deaths from pleural cancer.
The exclusion of 120 workers who experienced asbestos 
exposure before hire in the plant did not materially 
change the results: SMRs were 29.5 for peritoneal cancer 
(46 deaths), 2.97 for lung cancer (134 deaths) and 32.3 
for pleural cancer (54 deaths). When we included also 
person- 
years and deaths which occurred above age 85, 
resulting in a total of 74,535 person- 
years of observa-
tion and 1097 deaths, the results were not materially 
changed. In particular, the SMRs were 28.4 (95% CI: 
20.9–37.7) for peritoneal cancer, 32.6 (95% CI: 24.9–42.0) 
for pleural cancer, 2.95 (95% CI: 2.49–3.47) for lung 
cancer, and 3.17 (95% CI: 1.81–5.14) for ovarian 
cancer.
Discussion
Using an updated follow- 
up of this unique cohort of 
textile workers heavily exposed to asbestos, we were able 
to address the role of stopping exposure separately on 
pleural and peritoneal cancer. Both causes of death are 
related to asbestos exposure, but the latter has been studied 
less frequently than the former [2], and no data are avail-
able with respect to mortality from peritoneal cancer after 
stopping asbestos exposure.
The higher SMRs for pleural and peritoneal mesothe-
lioma in women compared to men are probably attribut-
able to the fact that women in the reference population 
have a lower rate of these neoplasms because of lower 
prevalence of past exposure to asbestos. Furthermore, in 
women, peritoneal cancer may be misclassified with ovar-
ian cancer (Prat et al., 2015) and we found an increased 
mortality from the latter, though an order of magnitude 
smaller than peritoneal cancer. More in general, the use 
of mortality data, which refer to pleural and peritoneal 
cancer, might have resulted in misclassification of diagnosis 
of mesothelioma, and this might have differed according 
to time since cessation of exposure since during the follow-
 
up the International Classification of Diseases coding 
changed to the 10th Edition, which included a unique 
code for mesothelioma. We are currently retrieving the 
pathological samples of the members of the cohort who 
died from pleural and peritoneal cancers in order to 
indentify confirmed cases of mesothelioma, and we plan 
to conduct detailed analyses on different exposure vari-
ables restricted to the confirmed cases. Similarly, the higher 
SMR for lung cancer in women can be explained by lower 
rates in the reference population because of lower preva-
lence of tobacco smoking and exposure to occupational 
carcinogens.
The present results confirm those of previous studies 
[7, 11] on the persistence of excess pleural cancer risk

after stopping asbestos exposure, and adds unique data 
on peritoneal cancer, indicating that also for this disease 
the excess risk does not level off up to 35 or more years 
since last exposure. This is consistent with the hypothesis 
of an important role of early asbestos exposure and of 
latency on subsequent mesothelioma risk, as it has been 
shown – mainly for the pleural form of the disease – in 
other studies [12]; La Vecchia et al., 2000; [13]; Frost, 
2013).
In the case of lung cancer, the SMR appears to decrease 
25 or more years since last exposure, although a possible 
effect of competitive mortality from mesothelioma might 
have played a role. With respect to the other exposure 
variables, the results of the multivariate analysis of mor-
tality from lung cancer and pleural cancer are consistent 
with previous evidence that duration of exposure – and 
hence its derived variable, cumulative exposure, is the 
main determinant of risk of lung cancer, whereas latency 
(including time since last exposure) is the main deter-
minant of risk of pleural cancer (Table S2; [3]. Results 
on peritoneal mesothelioma are more difficult to interpret, 
and more conclusive evidence will be provided after the 
ongoing validation of diagnoses of mesothelioma from 
death certificates will be completed.
Table 4 compares the results on mesothelioma mortality 
with those of other cohort studies of asbestos textile work-
ers: the higher proportion of deaths from mesothelioma 
in the present cohort is likely due to the use of 
crocidolite.
The choice to use regional reference rates was justified 
by the fact that region in which the plant is located has 
a higher mortality from mesothelioma and lung cancer 
than the country as a whole. This choice might have 
resulted in some underestimate of the risk of asbestos- 
related diseases since a relatively large proportion of the 
reference population was also exposed to asbestos. However, 
regional rates were not available for the first part of the 
follow- 
up, and we used national rates.
Among the other neoplastic causes of death, it is worth 
considering the nonstatistically significant increased SMRs 
for cancers of the head and neck, the esophagus and the 
colorectum. While an association between asbestos expo-
sure and head and neck cancer (in particular laryngeal 
cancer) has been reported in several populations [8], and 
the lack of statistical significance in this cohort might be 
due to the rarity of these malignancies in women (all 
deaths occurred among men), the data on risk of esopha-
geal and colorectal cancer among asbestos workers are 
more controversial [8]. The lack of consistency of the 
results between the female and the male components of 
the cohorts detracts from a causal interpretation of the 
findings for these two neoplasms.
Strengths of the study include on the unique exposure 
circumstances of this cohort, the long follow- 
up, and the 
low proportion of cohort members lost to follow- 
up. 
Limitations include the lack of individual exposure data, 
reliance of death certificates for outcome assessment – 
which can be particularly problematic in case of pleural 
and peritoneal cancer [18], and lack of information on 
potential confounders and effect modifiers, such as tobacco 
smoking in the case of lung cancer, and alcohol drinking 
for oral and pharyngeal cancer. As discussed above, we 
are conducting a validation of the diagnoses of pleural 
and peritoneal cancer, to increase the specificity of the 
assessment of outcome, and to repeat the analyses accord-
ing to time- 
related variables on a subset of confirmed 
deaths from peritoneal and pleural mesothelioma. 
Furthermore, we did not have complete information on 
employment of cohort members on other industries entail-
ing asbestos exposure, which may results in misclassifica-
tion of time- 
related exposure variables, such as time since 
last exposure. In this respect, age at first exposure might 
be a good indicator of the effect of early exposure because 
it is less correlated with the other time- 
related variables: 
an effect of age at first exposure is present for peritoneal 
and pleural cancer, but not for lung cancer.
In conclusion, the findings of this cohort provide novel 
evidence for peritoneal cancer, indicating that – as for 
pleural cancer – the excess risk does not decline up to 
several decades after cessation of exposure.
