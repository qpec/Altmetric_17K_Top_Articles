Abstract
Objective: frailty is a central concept in geriatric medicine, yet its utility in the Emergency Department (ED) is not well
understood nor well utilised. Our objectives were to develop an ED frailty index (FI-ED), using the Rockwood cumulative
deficits model and to evaluate its association with adverse outcomes.
Method: this was a large multinational prospective cohort study using data from the interRAI Multinational Emergency
Department Study. The FI-ED was developed from the Canadian cohort and validated in the multinational cohort. All
patients aged ≥75 years presenting to an ED were included. The FI-ED was created using 24 variables included in the
interRAI ED-Contact Assessment tool.
Results: there were 2,153 participants in the Canadian cohort and 1,750 in the multinational cohort. The distribution of the
FI-ED was similar to previous frailty indices. The mean FI-ED was 0.26 (Canadian cohort) and 0.32 (multinational cohort)
and the 99th percentile was 0.71 and 0.81, respectively. In the Canadian cohort, a 0.1 unit increase in the FI-ED was signifi-
cantly associated with admission (odds ratio (OR) = 1.43 [95% CI: 1.34−1.52]); death at 28 days (OR = 1.55 [1.38–1.73]);
prolonged hospital stay (OR = 1.37 [1.22–1.54]); discharge to long-term care (OR = 1.30 [1.16−1.47]); and need for
Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (OR = 1.51 [1.41–1.60]). The multinational cohort showed similar associations.
Conclusion: the FI-ED conformed to characteristics previously reported. A FI, developed and validated from a brief geri-
atric assessment tool could be used to identify ED patients at higher risk of adverse events.

Introduction
The Emergency Department (ED) is a nexus for health care
systems around the world: an intersection for community
care, primary care, in-patient care, long-term care and
rehabilitation care attended by the most vulnerable popula-
tions such as older adults. Populations are aging. Accordingly,
ED attendance by older adults presenting to ED with com-
plex needs and who are at high risk of adverse events is rising
[1]. Frailty, although rarely discussed in emergency medicine,
242

 is a core concept in geriatric medicine—a key factor in under-
standing older people and planning their care. It is defined as
a syndrome, of multidimensional etiology, characterised by
decreased physiologic reserve and resilience that increases a
patient’s vulnerability to stressors [2, 3]. Although the theoret-
ical definition is clear, the clinical and operational application
is challenging [4–7]. Screening tools for specific outcomes are
well studied in the ED but valid measurement of frailty in the
ED is lacking [8, 9]. It is hypothesised that measuring frailty
in the ED could have a substantial impact on the clinical
management of patients [10, 11]. Frailty may serve as the
ideal clinical feature for this purpose and represent a crucial
‘vital sign’ for older adults [12]. To our knowledge, no
research has investigated strategies to allow ED clinicians to
identify frailty by something more than gestalt.
There are two broadly accepted methods to measure
frailty: the Fried phenotype approach and the Rockwood
cumulative deficit approach. Both frailty models have been
used with success to predict increased risk of hospitalisation,
prolonged hospital stay, long-term care institutionalisation
and death [6, 13–15]. The Fried phenotype model requires
tests and information that are not readily available in an
emergency setting, and it defines frailty in ordinal terms.
Rockwood developed a cumulative deficit index, based on
the accumulated burden of deficits, to measure frailty [2]
using 92 variables based on a Comprehensive Geriatric
Assessment (CGA), done by a geriatrician. It would be com-
plex and time-consuming to operationalise in the ED. More
recent studies demonstrated that 30 variables are sufficient to
generate the same association with adverse outcomes [13].
None have been validated for widespread use in the ED.
Our objective was to develop and validate an ED-
specific frailty index (FI-ED), defined by the Rockwood
cumulative deficits model, using items from an existing
brief geriatric assessment tool in the ED.
Our secondary objective was to evaluate its association
with the following outcomes: hospital admission, death, pro-
longed hospital stay, need for a CGA and long-term care dis-
position as previously described by other frailty indices.
Method
Study design and setting
We conducted a secondary analysis of two cohorts from a
large multinational prospective cohort study, the interRAI
Multinational Emergency Department study [16, 17]. The FI-
ED was developed from the Canadian cohort and validated
using the multinational cohort. Approvals were obtained
from hospital and academic research ethics committees.
Selection of participants
Patients were recruited in nineteen EDs from seven countries
(Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Iceland, India, Sweden)
in 2012. Fifteen sites were urban teaching hospitals, three were
regional centres and one was a community centre. Patients
aged 75 or older were eligible for inclusion. Patients in severe
acute medical crisis defined as those to the highest triage level
of acuity/severity; those expected to die within 24 h; and those
who did not speak the native language were excluded. All
countries recruited eligible patients from the time of ED regis-
tration without any additional pre-selection. Recruitment was
done during weekdays, and on weekends in some sites [16,
17]. Details regarding participant recruitment, selection and
consents have been reported previously [16, 17].
Method and measurements
Participants were recruited at ED registration and were
assessed using the ED-Contact Assessment (ED-CA) shortly
after registration. The ED-CA is a short (~15 min) geriatric
assessment administered on supplementary software systems
in real time to identify and examine individual patient pro-
blems across geriatric domains (see Supplementary data,
Online Appendix 1, available in Age and Ageing online). The
predictive validity of the ED-CA has been demonstrated [16]
and the same assessment items have demonstrated excellent
psychometric properties in acute hospital settings [18–20].
The clinical items in the ED-CA were extensively tested
across a wide range of nations and languages [21]. The ED-
CA is used as part of the extended nursing assessment either
done by the nurse case manager or an allied health profes-
sional. It evaluates the patient’s premorbid and present condi-
tion.
Additional
information
collected
included:
socio-
demographic including age, sex, and previous living situation,
discharge disposition, previous ED use, hospital admission
and a measure of triage acuity.
Development of FI-ED
A FI differs from a clinical decision rule and a diagnostic
test. There is a well-defined methodology that guided the
development of the FI-ED [22]. The deficits included
met all these five criteria:
(1) must be associated with health status and not be a nat-
ural attribute of aging;
(2) prevalence must increase with age;
(3) must not saturate too early in age;
(4) must collectively cover a range of body systems; and
(5) must be used similarly and serially on the same sample.
The ED-CA recorded 39 clinical variables and 24 were
selected by two experts. A third party evaluated the selec-
tion and discrepancies were resolved by discussions. Most
variables were coded as binary: either 1 (present) or 0
(absence). The FI-ED was established as a fraction, where
the numerator was the number of deficits present for the
individual patient and the denominator was 24, the number
of deficits collected from the ED-CA. Because the FI is
based on a cumulative deficit model, we did not review the
predictive value of each individual item.
We could not compare our FI with other instruments as
there is no gold standard for frailty assessment in the ED [6].

Identification of older adults with frailty

 In keeping with the methodological guidelines, we validated
the FI by evaluating its association with a broad range of geri-
atric outcomes [22]. Consistent with all frailty indices, the FI-
ED was expressed as a continuous number between 0 and 1.
Outcomes
Outcomes measured included: admission to hospital following
the present ED visit; death at 28 days recorded from hospital
data, death certificate or telephone follow-up; prolonged
length of stay in-hospital if admitted following the ED visit
(in days) defined as the country specific 90th percentile of
length of stay; discharge to a long-term care facility (nursing
home). Alternate level of care (ALC), a prolonged hospital
admission beyond the acute care phase due to absence of suit-
able discharge destination, is widely used in Canada. Follow-
up at 28 days was done by telephone or with the secondary
use of electronic regional hospital and mortality records.
Beyond objective outcomes, the perceived need for a CGA
was recorded by the assessor (trained nurses or allied health
professionals), based on their overall clinical judgement.
Analysis
Stratified analyses were used to investigate the prevalence of
descriptive characteristics, frailty, and adverse outcomes by coun-
try. Univariate logistic regression was used to determine the
observed relationship between the FI-ED and adverse outcome
in both cohorts. The number of events included in each cohort
provided more than adequate power to estimate associations
between the FI-ED and adverse outcomes [23]. Confidence
intervals were calculated at the 95% level (alpha = 0.05).
Ad hoc analysis sought to determine outcome specific
cut-points for the FI-ED that optimised both sensitivity
and specificity based on the Youden’s J statistic. Because
there are no widely accepted cut-points for a FI, we showed
the highest 10% (90th percentile) and the highest 25%
(75th percentile) of the FI-ED range in our population.
Likelihood ratios (LR) were calculated for each outcomes
and cut-point of the FI-ED. LR combine sensitivity and
specificity to determine probability of the outcome with a
high FI-ED (positive LR/ability to rule-in outcome) and
lower FI-ED (negative LR/ability to rule-out outcome). All
analyses were performed using SAS
® Version 9.3 for
Windows (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). We report our
findings according to the STROBE statement [24].
Results
For the development of the FI-ED, we included 2,153 par-
ticipants from the Canadian cohort. For the validation, we
included 1,750 participants from the multinational cohort.
As previously reported, follow-up was complete for 97% of
participants [16]. Missing data was limited: 0.1–2% in most
items; 14.2% in the informal helper status question. Mean
age and gender distribution were similar in both groups
(Table 1). Participants in the validation cohort seemed to
have a greater burden of disease.
The list of the variables included in the FI-ED is shown
in Online Appendix 1 (Supplementary data are available in
Age and Ageing online). Among the Canadian cohort, the
mean FI-ED was 0.26; with a 99th percentile of 0.71. Online
Appendix 2 (Supplementary data are available in Age and
Ageing online) shows the distribution of the FI-ED across all
countries. For the multinational cohort, the mean FI-ED was
0.32; with a 99th percentile of 0.82. Across all countries the
mean FI-ED ranged from 0.24 (Australia) to 0.59 (India).
Similarly the 99th percentile ranged from 0.69 (Iceland) and
0.86 (India). It shows the normal distribution, a characteristic
used to evaluate a FI performance (according to previous
studies), of the FI-ED across all countries [2, 22, 25].
Admission rates varied widely across both cohorts. In
the Canadian cohort 52% of patients were admitted; in the
validation cohort, admission rates varied from 34% (Australia)
to 91% (Germany) (Figure 1). Table 2 demonstrates the
association between the FI-ED and the outcomes. The odds
ratio (OR) represents the association with outcomes for each
0.1-increase of the FI-ED. A higher FI-ED showed a statis-
tically significant association with admission in both cohorts.
A sensitivity analysis was done to evaluate the association of
the FI-ED with admission excluding the German cohort,
which showed a significant association with an unadjusted
OR of 1.12 (CI 95%: 1.04–1.20). Death at 28 days and pro-
longed hospital stay were significantly associated with
increased FI-ED in both cohorts. Similarly, there was a statis-
tically significant association with the FI-ED and a prolonged
hospital stay. In the Canadian cohort the rate of disposition
to long-term care was 9.9 and 17% of admitted patients
were designated ALC. The FI-ED was associated with both
outcomes. Although the rate of disposition to long-term care
was similar in both cohorts (≈10%), it was negatively asso-
ciated with the FI-ED in the validation cohort (OR = 0.84
[CI 95%: 0.75–0.85]). The FI-ED was strongly associated
with the assessors’ perceived need for a CGA.
The results are unadjusted for gender and age because
they were not different when analysed.
The highest 10 and 25% scores on the FI-ED were
associated with overall modest diagnostic performance
across outcomes and cohorts (see Supplementary data,
Online Appendix 3, available in Age and Ageing online). The
perceived need for CGA as well as death at 28 days showed
meaningful positive LR across cohorts. Cut-points opti-
mised for both sensitivity and specificity varied from 0.22
(admission) to 0.48 (death) with a maximum sensitivity of
78% achieved for being discharged to higher level of care
(specificity 50%) in the Canadian cohort.
Discussion
This is the first study to develop and validate a FI accord-
ing to a broadly endorsed model from a multinational per-
spective. Our findings suggest that frailty is generalisable to
many contexts, including the ED. A strength of the FI-ED

 is that it represented frailty in a continuous, clinically relevant
manner. This allows for clinical interpretation and judgement
across a continuous spectrum. Sirois et al. [26] recognised the
clinical utility of measuring frailty and functional decline but
did not establish a practical way to operationalise it in the
ED. We demonstrated that an easily administered 24-item
assessment that captures important geriatric conditions, and
available in an electronic medical record, can be used to gen-
erate the FI-ED [27].
We confirmed that the FI-ED had similar properties to
more detailed frailty indices that were validated and are in
use in other contexts [28, 29], and we established that the
FI-ED was associated with a variety of patient-centred and
system-centred outcomes.
Other studies have also explored the use of frailty measure-
ment in the ED. Salvi et al. found that frailty was associated
with poor survival rate, as well as a higher rate of hospital
admission and ED revisit at 6 months using a Rockwood
cumulative deficit model that was based on a CGA. We
employed a cumulative deficits model given its ability to be
derived from existing information and therefore maximising
cost-utility. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis, by
Carpenter et al. [8], showed that available geriatric screening
tools do not adequately discriminate between low risk and
high-risk patients, highlighting the need for a more refined and
detailed, yet feasible, measure to prioritise vulnerability.
The FI-ED showed variability across countries, which
likely reflects differences in underlying health care systems as
well as each site’s unique organisation within countries. The
Indian cohort had the highest mean FI-ED, 0.59 compared
to 0.32 in the entire multinational cohort [30]. We noted
other differences in ED care in this study. In Germany, 91%

Identification of older adults with frailty
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article-abstract/47/2/242/4642846 by guest on 05 June 2019
 of older adults were admitted compared to 52% in Canada
and 34% in Australia. We found a protective effect of frailty
for long-term care disposition in the multinational validation
cohort suggesting that the use of long-term care resources in
acute care is not consistent across countries.
We analysed the possibility of defining outcome specific
cut-points for the FI-ED that optimised sensitivity and spe-
cificity. We found that the overall predictive value for each
outcome was modest for each cut-point across countries.
Given low sensitivity at higher cut-points, the FI-ED may
be best utilised for case findings (i.e. prioritise specificity)
according to available geriatric resources rather than using
optimised a priori diagnostic thresholds.
This study collected data amongst the most representative
multinational cohorts available and was consistent with previ-
ously studies. However, the cohorts were convenience
samples and do not necessarily reflect the entire population
of older adults. Some country cohorts were unable to recruit
all consecutive participants and most were unable to recruit
patients outside of weekdays. Nonetheless, the study was
designed to ensure no other systematic bias in selection.
There are no guidelines that endorse patient-centred adverse
outcome post-discharge among older ED patients. In the
absence of guidelines, we used outcomes commonly reported
in the literature. The FI-ED focussed primarily on functional
characteristics. It could have been improved by the inclusion
of diagnostic information. However, in the ED, diagnoses
are often provisional, and reliable diagnostic information
could not be collected across countries. Despite the absence
of diagnostic information, a validated FI was possible, sug-
gesting that geriatric syndromes are a reflection of underlying
conditions and are powerful in isolation.
The FI-ED was developed from a short, electronic ED
geriatric assessment identifying the most vulnerable older
adults in the ED provides an opportunity to consider frailty
in diagnostic reasoning, intervention and disposition plan-
ning. It may also allow EDs to systematically adapt care in
order to prevent adverse events such as deconditioning,
and to support post-discharge care providers in providing
timely and effective follow-up care.
Conclusion
In summary, we used a cumulative deficit model of frailty
to develop a feasible ED-specific FI. We demonstrated the
validity of the FI-ED using a cohort from seven countries.
In an era of increasing ED presentations by older adults
and as EDs implement models of care to improve their
assessment and management, the FI-ED may provide a
tool to better target resources and tailor care.
Key points
• This is the first study to develop a frailty index according to
a broadly endorsed model from a multinational perspective.
• Frailty may serve as the ideal clinical feature for prognosis
in the Emergency Department and represent a crucial
‘vital sign’ for older adult.
• The Frailty Index is easily measured in real-time in the
Emergency Department (ED), using the ED-Contact
Assessment, an InterRAI tool.

Abstract
Background: alcohol consumption has many harmful health effects, but also benefits of moderate consumption on frailty
have been reported. We examined this relationship longitudinally from midlife to old age.
Methods: data of reported alcohol consumption in midlife (year 1974) and in old age (years 2000 and 2003) were available
of a socioeconomically homogenous sample of 2360 men (born 1919–34, the Helsinki Businessmen Study). Alcohol con-
sumption was divided into zero (N = 131 at baseline), light (1–98 g/week, N = 920), moderate (99–196, N = 593), and
high consumption (>196, n = 716). Incidence of phenotypic frailty and prefrailty was assessed in 2000 and 2003. Alcohol
consumption (reference 1–98 g/week, adjusted for age, body mass index and smoking) was related to frailty both longitu-
dinally (from 1974 to 2000, and from 2000 to 2003) and cross-sectionally in 2000 and 2003.
Results: during a 30-year follow-up, high consumption clearly decreased whereas lighter consumption remained stable.
High consumption in midlife predicted both frailty (odds ratio = 1.61, 95% confidence interval = 1.01–2.56) and prefrailty
(1.42; 1.06–1.92) in 2000, association with zero and moderate consumption was insignificant. Cross-sectionally in 2000,
both zero (2.08; 1.17–3.68) and high consumption (1.83; 1.07–3.13) were associated with frailty, while in 2003 only zero
consumption showed this association (2.47; 1.25–4.88).
Conclusion: the relationship between alcohol and frailty is a paradox during the life course. High, not zero, consumption in
midlife predicts old age frailty, while zero consumption in old age is associated with frailty, probably reflecting reverse causality.

Introduction
Frailty is caused by the gradual accumulation of diverse
molecular and cellular damage which eventually results in
vulnerability and disease [1, 2]. Oxidative stress, telomere
shortening, and mutations of mitochondria and nuclear
DNA may be defects at the cellular level. Alcohol is known
