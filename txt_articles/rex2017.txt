CLINICAL GUIDELINES
 
Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is the process of detecting 
early-stage CRCs and precancerous lesions in asymptomatic peo-
ple with no prior history of cancer or precancerous lesions. Th

U.S. Multi-Society Task Force of Colorectal Cancer (MSTF) is a 
panel of expert gastroenterologists representing the American 
College of Gastroenterology, the American Gastroenterological 
Association, and the American Society for Gastrointestinal 
Endoscopy. Th
 e MSTF, like others, has long endorsed systematic 
off
 ers of CRC screening to average-risk persons (persons without 
a high-risk family history of colorectal neoplasia) beginning at age 
50 years, with general evidence supporting screening reviewed in

This document updates the colorectal cancer (CRC) screening recommendations of the U.S. Multi-Society Task 
Force of Colorectal Cancer (MSTF), which represents the American College of Gastroenterology, the American 
Gastroenterological Association, and The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. CRC screening tests 
are ranked in 3 tiers based on performance features, costs, and practical considerations. The fi
 rst-tier tests are 
colonoscopy every 10 years and annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT). Colonoscopy and FIT are recommended 
as the cornerstones of screening regardless of how screening is offered. Thus, in a sequential approach based on 
colonoscopy offered fi
 rst, FIT should be offered to patients who decline colonoscopy. Colonoscopy and FIT are 
recommended as tests of choice when multiple options are presented as alternatives. A risk-stratifi
 ed approach 
is also appropriate, with FIT screening in populations with an estimated low prevalence of advanced neoplasia 
and colonoscopy screening in high prevalence populations. The second-tier tests include CT colonography every 
5 years, the FIT-fecal DNA test every 3 years, and fl
 exible sigmoidoscopy every 5 to 10 years. These tests are 
appropriate screening tests, but each has disadvantages relative to the tier 1 tests. Because of limited evidence 
and current obstacles to use, capsule colonoscopy every 5 years is a third-tier test. We suggest that the Septin9 
serum assay (Epigenomics, Seattle, Wash) not be used for screening. Screening should begin at age 50 years in 
average-risk persons, except in African Americans in whom limited evidence supports screening at 45 years. CRC 
incidence is rising in persons under age 50, and thorough diagnostic evaluation of young persons with suspected 
colorectal bleeding is recommended. Discontinuation of screening should be considered when persons up to date 
with screening, who have prior negative screening (particularly colonoscopy), reach age 75 or have <10 years of life 
expectancy. Persons without prior screening should be considered for screening up to age 85, depending on age and 
comorbidities. Persons with a family history of CRC or a documented advanced adenoma in a fi
 rst-degree relative 
age <60 years or 2 fi
 rst-degree relatives with these fi
 ndings at any age are recommended to undergo screening by 
colonoscopy every 5 years, beginning 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected relative or age 
40, whichever is earlier. Persons with a single fi
 rst-degree relative diagnosed at ≥60 years with CRC or an advanced 
adenoma can be offered average-risk screening options beginning at age 40 years.

ing recommendations of the MSTF for screening in average-risk 
persons ( 
1 
).
 
Screening diff
 ers from surveillance. Surveillance refers to the 
interval use of colonoscopy in patients with previously detected 
CRC or precancerous lesions and interval colonoscopy in patients 
performed to detect dysplasia in persons with infl
 ammatory bowel 
disease aff
 ecting the colon. Surveillance recommendations from 
the MSTF on surveillance aft
 er cancer ( 
2 
) and removal of pre-
cancerous lesions ( 
3 
) are available in other documents. Screening 
is also distinct from diagnostic examinations, which refer to the 
investigation of patients with symptoms or positive screening tests 
other than colonoscopy. Colonoscopy is generally the test of choice 
for diagnostic examinations.
 
METHODS
 
Literature review
 
Th
 e English language medical literature using MEDLINE (2005 
to August 1, 2016), EMBASE (2005 to third quarter 2016 update), 
the Database of Abstracts of Reviews and Eff
 ects (2005 to third 
quarter 2016 update), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic 
Reviews (2005 to third quarter 2014 update) was searched. In 
MEDLINE, subject headings for colorectal cancer screening were 
combined with headings for fecal occult blood test, fecal immu-
nochemical test, colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, CT colonoscopy, 
fecal DNA, serum testing, cost-eff
 ectiveness, and quality. Similar 
searches were performed in EMBASE, the Database of Abstracts 
of Reviews and Eff
 ects, and the Cochrane Database of System-
atic Reviews. Case reports and studies performed in patients with 
infl
 ammatory bowel disease, prior CRC or polyps, or hereditary 
CRC syndromes were excluded. Review papers, meta-analyses, 
gastroenterology textbooks, and editorials were searched manu-
ally for additional pertinent references. Th
 e review includes studies 
published since 2008 but also incorporates older evidence used 
to draft
  the 2008 recommendations ( 
1 
). Evidence-based weighted 
recommendations are provided with supporting discussion to 
help guide clinicians in the management of these patients.
 
Process and levels of evidence
 
Guidance statements were developed by consensus obtained 
through joint teleconferences. Th
 e completed article was reviewed 
and approved by all 3 gastroenterology societies.
 
Th
 e use of GRADE for MSTF guidance papers has been outlined 
in detail elsewhere ( 
2 
). GRADE involves comprehensive literature 
search and summary (oft
 en through meta-analysis) and then a 
separate review of literature quality and development of recom-
mendations. Th
 e MSTF uses a modifi
 ed qualitative approach based 
on literature review (as described above for this article) but with-
out formal meta-analysis. GRADE allows for a separate assessment 
of the quality of the evidence and strength of recommendation. 
Th
 is approach explicitly recognizes the importance of literature in 
informing clinical recommendations but allows latitude because 
recommendations may be infl
 uenced by other factors, such as 
patient preference, cost, and expert consensus. “Strong recom-
mendations” are those that would be chosen by most informed 
patients. “Weak recommendations” are those where patient values 
and preferences might play a larger role than the quality of evi-
dence. Within the document we preface strong recommendations 
with phrases such as “we recommend” and weak recommenda-
tions with “we suggest.”
 
APPROACHES TO SCREENING
 
In the United States CRC screening usually results from an offi
  ce-
based interaction between a healthcare provider and patient. 
Screening in this setting is termed  
opportunistic ( 
4 
).
 
Programmatic screening (sometimes called  
organized screening) 
refers to a system-wide, organized approach to off
 ering screening 
to a population or members of a healthcare plan ( 
4 
). Programmatic 
screening has potential advantages over opportunistic screening, 
including systematic off
 ers of screening, reduction of overscreen-
ing, superior monitoring of quality, and systematic follow-up 
of testing. National CRC screening programs in Europe ( 
5 
) and 
Australia ( 
6 
) use fecal occult blood testing and include screening 
colonoscopy in Germany and Poland ( 
5 
). Th
 e United States has 
no national program for CRC screening, although several large 
healthcare plans off
 er programmatic screening, typically with a 
fecal immunochemical test (FIT) ( 
7 
). Despite the potential advan-
tages of programmatic screening, the United States has achieved 
the world'
s highest rates of CRC screening compliance at 60% 
and the greatest CRC incidence and mortality reduction, using an 
almost entirely opportunistic approach ( 
8–12 
). Incidence reduc-
tions in the United States were 3 to 4% per year and 30% overall 
in the fi
 rst decade of this century ( 
11,12 
). High rates of screening 
in the United States may refl
 ect widespread awareness of CRC and 
insurance coverage of screening. Th
 e MSTF anticipates growth of 
programmatic screening within healthcare systems but expects at 
least short-term continued reliance on opportunistic screening in 
the United States. Reliance on opportunistic screening can aff
 ect 
the preference for CRC screening, because achieving compli-
ance with tests that should be repeated at short intervals is more 
challenging in the opportunistic setting ( 
13 
).
 
In the setting of opportunistic screening, healthcare providers 
can use several broad strategies to off
 er screening to patients. One 
approach is  
multiple options 
, in which the benefi
 ts, risks, and costs 
of 2 or more tests are discussed and off
 ered to patients ( 
Table 1 
) 
( 
14 
). Some evidence suggests that when patients are off
 ered 
both colonoscopy and fecal occult blood testing, more patients 
undergo screening ( 
15 
). Other data suggest no benefi
 t in over-
all compliance when multiple options are off
 ered ( 
16–18 
). In 1 
study, off
 ering patients 5 options did not enhance compliance 
over 2 options ( 
19 
). In this regard, at least 9 diff
 erent screening 
tests (colonoscopy, FIT, guaiac-based fecal occult blood test, FIT-
fecal DNA, sigmoidoscopy, sigmoidoscopy plus fecal occult blood 
test, CT colonography, barium enema, and the Septin9 serum 
assay [Epigenomics, Seattle, Wash]) are endorsed or discussed 
in recent major screening guidelines ( 
14,20 
). Th
 us, the multiple 
options discussion may best be limited to 2 or 3 preferred options. 
If patients decline all the off
 ered options, 1 or more of the other 
options can be off
 ered.

Th
 e MSTF considers that each of the approaches outlined above 
is reasonable when off
 ering screening in the opportunistic setting. 
Th
 ere is insuffi
  cient evidence to identify one approach as superior. 
Patients undergoing screening tests other than colonoscopy should 
understand that colonoscopy is used to evaluate these tests when 
positive. In some instances insurance coverage of colonoscopy per-
formed to evaluate other positive screening tests may be less than 
coverage of primary screening colonoscopy. Awareness of the dif-
ferent approaches may assist clinicians in understanding screening 
literature and in selecting an approach to off
 ering screening that 
seems to be optimal for their practice or for an individual patient.
 
Recommendations
 
1 
.  
We recommend that clinicians off
 er CRC screening begin-
ning at age 50 (strong recommendation, high-quality 
evidence). (See below for adjustments in recommended age 
for onset of screening based on race and family history.) 
 
2 
.  
We suggest that sequential off
 ers of screening tests, off
 ering 
multiple screening options, and risk-stratifi
 ed screening 
are all reasonable approaches to off
 ering screening (weak 
recommendation, low-quality evidence). 
 
SCREENING TARGETS
 
Th
 e object of screening is to reduce CRC incidence and mortality. 
To accomplish both aims, tests need to detect early-stage (i.e., 
curable) CRCs and high-risk precancerous lesions ( 
1,21 
). Detec-
tion and removal of precancerous lesions prevents CRC ( 
30,31 
). 
Th
 e 2 main classes of precancerous lesions in the colon are con-
ventional adenomas and serrated class lesions ( 
Table 2 
). Th
 ese 2 
classes of precancerous lesions have distinct endoscopic features 
and histology and diff
 erent (though overlapping) distributions 
within the colorectum. Specifi
 c screening tests sometimes have 
 
Th
 e  
sequential approach to screening involves an off
 er of a fi
 rst 
test that is usually the provider'
s preferred screening option; if the 
patient declines the fi
 rst option, a second test is off
 ered, and so 
on. In the United States the sequential approach oft
 en involves an 
off
 er of colonoscopy, followed by FIT if colonoscopy is declined, 
or another screening test ( 
9 
). Separate guidelines from the Ameri-
can College of Gastroenterology ( 
21 
) and the American Society 
for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy ( 
22 
) recommend a sequential 
approach with colonoscopy off
 ered fi
 rst. Sequential testing can 
maximize compliance overall as well as with the test recommended 
fi
 rst ( 
23–25 
). Clinicians using the colonoscopy-fi
 rst sequential 
approach place emphasis on the high effi
  cacy of colonoscopy in 
preventing CRC and less emphasis on the risks of colonoscopy. 
Indeed, high-quality colonoscopy has both higher single-time 
testing effi
  cacy and greater risks than any other screening tests but 
with absolute risk rates that are still very low when performed by 
skilled operators ( 
26 
). A variant of sequential testing oft
 en used in 
the programmatic setting is to off
 er patients FIT as the initial or 
preferred test and have other options such as colonoscopy available 
to patients who express interest in alternatives ( 
4 
).
 
A third approach to off
 ering screening to average-risk persons 
is a  
risk-stratifi
 ed 
 approach. Risk stratifi
 cation uses evidence that 
the “
average-risk” population actually represents a wide range of 
risk that can be estimated based on demographic and other risk 
factors. For example, older age, male gender, obesity, diabetes, and 
cigarette smoking are all associated with colorectal adenomas and 
cancer and therefore might be used in stratifying risk within the 
average-risk population ( 
21 
). Th
 e goal is to predict subgroups of 
patients with a high prevalence of important precancerous lesions 
benefi
 ting most from referral directly to colonoscopy, whereas the 
subgroups with a predicted lower risk (prevalence) of important 
precancerous lesions are referred for screening tests with less risk 
and cost than colonoscopy. Risk stratifi
 cation has been poorly 
accepted because of limited accuracy in discriminating high- and 
low-prevalence subgroups ( 
27 
). However, recent validated models 
appear to be simple to apply and had substantial accuracy in defi
 n-
ing high- and low-risk groups for advanced adenomas ( 
28,29 
). 
Th
 ere are no clinical trials comparing compliance or other out-
comes using a risk-stratifi
 ed approach to the multiple options or 
sequential approaches. Few data are currently available regarding 
ease of application of a risk-stratifi
 ed approach in clinical practice.

particular strengths or weaknesses detecting 1 or the other class 
of precancerous lesions, particularly the serrated class. Th
 ere-
fore, we review here the main clinical features of the 2 classes of 
precancerous lesions.
 
Adenomas, also known as conventional adenomas, are the pre-
cursors of perhaps 70% of all CRCs ( 
32,33 
). Th
 e adenoma-carci-
noma sequence is believed to typically take more than 10 years 
to complete in sporadic cancers, whereas much shorter intervals 
occur in Lynch syndrome ( 
34 
). Correspondingly, colonoscopy is 
recommended at 10-year intervals in average-risk persons and at 
1- to 2-year intervals in those with Lynch syndrome ( 
1,34 
). Th
 e 
distribution of adenomas is relatively even throughout the colon, 
although adenomas with a fl
 at or depressed morphology are dis-
tributed more to the proximal colon and pedunculated lesions 
more to the distal colon ( 
35 
). Adenomas are by defi
 nition dys-
plastic, with the overwhelming majority being low grade. Th
 e pres-
ence of high-grade dysplasia in an adenoma should be noted by 
a pathologist. Adenomas can also be characterized by tubular vs. 
villous histology, with the overwhelming majority tubular. Lesions 
with >25% villous elements are termed  
tubulovillous and those 
with >75% villous elements  
villous 
. Villous elements and invasive 
cancer are associated with increasing size of adenomas. Invasive 
cancer in adenomas ≤5 mm in size is extremely rare, and the preva-
lence remains well below 1% in adenomas 6 to 9 mm in size ( 
36 
). 
Recent colonoscopic studies have identifi
 ed lower prevalence rates 
of cancer in polyps <1 cm in size compared with early studies, 
probably because improvements in colonoscope technology and 
performance have led to routine detection of an array of small, 
fl
 at, low-volume adenomas ( 
36 
). Interobserver agreement in 
diff
 erentiation of high- vs. low-grade dysplasia by pathologists 
and tubular vs. tubulovillous histology is poor to moderate, 
particularly in adenomas <1 cm in size ( 
37 
). Conversely, inter-
observer agreement between pathologists is good to excellent 
in placing lesions within the conventional adenomas vs. serrated 
polyps and in identifying invasive cancer ( 
38 
).
 
An important clinical concept is the “
advanced” adenoma, 
defi
 ned as a lesion ≥1 cm in size or having high-grade dysplasia 
or villous elements ( 
3 
). Because nonadvanced adenomas have 
a very low prevalence of cancer and a long adenoma-cancer 
sequence, screening tests can remain useful if they target cancer 
and advanced adenomas and not small adenomas. Further, the 
prevalence of nonadvanced adenomas is so high in modern colo-
noscopy studies that detection of such lesions by noncolonoscopic 
screening tests leads to unacceptably low specifi
 city. Colonoscopy 
has an important benefi
 t over other screening methods because of 
its ability to detect and remove both advanced and non 
advanced 
adenomas. Although nonadvanced adenomas have limited 
clinical importance and are not the target of noncolonoscopic 
screening methods, colonoscopists strive to identify and remove 
non 
advanced adenomas. Th
 us, resecting lesions with any precan-
cerous potential during colonoscopy is safe, seems to be better 
accepted by patients in the United States, and removes them as 
a clinical concern.
 
 
Serrated colorectal lesions ( 
Figure 1 
) represent an emerging area 
in the fi
 eld of precancerous colorectal lesions. Th
 e serrated class 
of precursor lesions accounts for up to 30% of CRCs ( 
33 
). Within 
the serrated class, hyperplastic polyps are not currently considered 
precancerous, whereas sessile serrated polyps (SSPs; also known as 
sessile serrated adenoma) and traditional serrated adenomas are 
considered precancerous ( 
Table 2 
) ( 
33 
). Hyperplastic polyps are

should consider choosing colonoscopy. Although no randomized 
trials of colonoscopy for screening have been completed, exten-
sive evidence from adenoma cohorts ( 
30,31 
), cohort studies on 
incidence and mortality ( 
55,56 
), and case-control studies ( 
57–64 
) 
support the effi
  cacy of colonoscopy in preventing incident CRC 
and cancer deaths. One cohort study ( 
56 
) and 3 case-control stud-
ies ( 
58,59,64 
) were performed in screening populations. Reduc-
tions in incidence and mortality are approximately 80% in the 
distal colon and 40 to 60% in the proximal colon, at least in the 
United States and Germany ( 
57,59,61,62,64 
). Furthermore, indi-
rect evidence from randomized trials of fecal occult blood testing 
( 
65 
) and sigmoidoscopy ( 
66 
), as well as studies showing highly 
variable cancer protection provided by diff
 erent colonoscopists 
( 
67,68 
), also supports a protective eff
 ect of colonoscopy against 
CRC. Th
 ese fi
 ndings are consistent with the observed population 
trends in the United States ( 
11,12 
).
 
Disadvantages of colonoscopy include the need for thorough 
bowel cleansing, a higher risk of perforation relative to the other 
screening tests, higher risk of aspiration pneumonitis (particu-
larly when the procedure is performed with deep sedation) ( 
69 
), 
a small risk of splenic injury requiring splenectomy, and a greater 
risk of postprocedural bleeding compared with other screening 
tests. A meta-analysis of population-based studies found risks of 
perforation, bleeding, and death of 0.5 per 1000, 2.6 per 1000, 
and 2.9 per 100,000, respectively ( 
70 
). Bleeding aft
 er colono-
scopy is almost entirely related to polypectomy. When electro-
cautery is used for resection of all colorectal polyps, most bleeds 
occur aft
 er resection of small lesions. Th
 is relates entirely to the 
high prevalence of these lesions because increasing polyp size 
and proximal colon location are the major risk factors for bleed-
ing per individual resected polyp ( 
71 
). Cold resection techniques 
are eff
 ective and nearly devoid of clinically signifi
 cant bleeding 
risk and can be generally advised for nonpedunculated lesions 
<1 cm in size ( 
72 
). Despite these risks, colonoscopy is the pre-
ferred approach to management of any benign colorectal polyp 
regardless of size or location because the alternative of surgical 
resection has higher mortality and cost compared with colono-
scopy ( 
73,74 
). To the extent that other screening tests eff
 ectively 
identify large lesions, they result in colonoscopy and do not pre-
vent adverse events related to colonoscopic resection of large 
lesions.
 
A major disadvantage of colonoscopy is operator dependence 
in performance. Operator dependence aff
 ects detection of can-
cer ( 
67,68,75 
), adenomas ( 
76,77 
), and serrated lesions ( 
40,41,78 
); 
selection of appropriate screening and surveillance intervals aft
 er 
colonoscopy ( 
79 
); and eff
 ective resection of colorectal polyps 
( 
80 
). In general, gastroenterologists performing colonoscopy are 
more eff
 ective than nongastroenterologists in prevention of can-
cer ( 
62,81–83 
) and detection of precancerous polyps ( 
84 
). How-
ever, substantial operator dependence within gastroenterologists 
is consistently observed ( 
42,43,76–78 
), so that selection of a colo-
noscopist by specialty is not adequate protection against subopti-
mal operator performance.  
Table 3 shows a list of questions that 
patients can ask potential colonoscopists to judge whether perfor-
mance is likely to be at a high level. Aft
 erward, the colonoscopy 
usually small lesions and are distributed toward the distal colon 
( 
39 
). SSPs are common (found in 8–9% of screening colonoscopies 
performed by expert detectors) ( 
40,41 
) and are distributed toward 
the proximal colon compared with conventional adenomas. SSPs 
are typically fl
 at or sessile in shape, have few or no surface blood 
vessels (conventional adenomas by comparison have many surface 
vessels), and are more diffi
  cult to detect at colonoscopy than con-
ventional adenomas ( 
33,42,43 
). Because of their prevalence and 
precancerous potential, SSPs are the major precancerous serrated 
lesion. Th
 ere is poor interobserver agreement between patho-
logists in the diff
 erentiation of hyperplastic polyps from SSPs ( 
44 
). 
Consequently, clinicians can see widely varying rates of SSPs in 
pathology reports, depending on the pathologist or even the center 
in which they practice ( 
45 
). Most SSPs are not dysplastic, and the 
lesions should consistently be designated as “SSP without cytologic 
dysplasia” or “SSP with cytologic dysplasia.” ( 
46 
) When a dysplastic 
component is present, it is oft
 en evident endoscopically ( 
Figure 1 
) 
and histologically is a region of conventional adenoma within an 
otherwise serrated lesion ( 
47 
). Microdissection studies indicate 
that the dysplastic area oft
 en has microsatellite instability ( 
48 
). Th
 e 
SSP with cytologic dysplasia is considered a more advanced lesion 
in the polyp cancer sequence than SSP without cytologic dysplasia 
( 
3,33,49,50 
).
 
Th
 e traditional serrated adenoma is a rare lesion, oft
 en in the 
left
  colon, sessile, and uniformly dysplastic ( 
33,46 
). Because tradi-
tional serrated adenoma is rare, dysplastic, and has a villous-like 
growth pattern histologically, it is oft
 en misinterpreted as a tubu-
lovillous conventional adenoma ( 
33 
).
 
Th
 e features of these 2 classes of precancerous lesions are rele-
vant to the available screening tests. Colonoscopy is the criterion 
standard for the detection of all precancerous colorectal lesions. 
Colonoscopy achieves its greatest superiority relative to other 
screening tests in the detection of conventional adenomas <1 cm 
in size and serrated class lesions. Detection of SSPs is a major defi
 -
ciency of fl
 exible sigmoidoscopy because SSPs are predominantly 
in the proximal colon ( 
51 
), of CT colonography because the lesions 
tend to be fl
 at ( 
52 
), and of FIT ( 
53 
) probably because SSPs have no 
or few surface blood vessels with less tendency to bleed than con-
ventional adenomas. Th
 e combined FIT-fecal DNA test achieves 
its greatest relative performance compared with FIT alone in the 
detection of serrated class lesions, related to the poor sensitivity 
of FIT for these lesions and the inclusion of hypermethylation 
markers in the DNA panel ( 
53 
). Hypermethylation is a feature of 
serrated lesions ( 
33 
).
 
SPECIFIC SCREENING TESTS
 
Colonoscopy
 
Th
 e advantages of colonoscopy include high sensitivity for 
cancer and all classes of precancerous lesions, single-session 
diagnosis and treatment, and long intervals between examinations 
(10 years) in subjects with normal examinations. One or 2 nega-
tive examinations may signal lifetime protection against CRC ( 
54 
). 
Patients who value the highest level of sensitivity in detection of 
precancerous lesions and are willing to undergo invasive screening

report should contain the items in  
Table 3 as an additional check 
on the adequacy of the procedure.
 
Fecal immunochemical test
 
Advantages of FIT include its noninvasive nature, 1-time sensitiv-
ity for cancer of 79% in 1 meta-analysis ( 
85 
), fair sensitivity for 
advanced adenomas (approximately 30%), and low 1-time cost 
(approximately $20). FIT is recommended annually in the United 
States. Th
 e MSTF has recently issued detailed recommendations 
on the technical performance of FIT ( 
86 
) and considers FIT an 
essential element of the CRC screening armamentarium for all 
practitioners. FIT is commonly the test of choice in programmatic 
screening, an excellent second choice for practitioners using 
sequential testing who off
 er colonoscopy fi
 rst, and should likely 
always be one of the tests included in a multiple-options approach. 
Disadvantages of FIT include the need for repeated testing, which 
can be problematic in the nonprogrammatic (opportunistic) set-
ting ( 
13 
), and poor or no sensitivity for serrated class precursor 
lesions ( 
53 
). However, there is no evidence that cancers arising 
through serrated class lesions are less likely to bleed than those 
arising via adenomas.
 
FIT-fecal DNA test
 
Th
 e U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a CRC 
screening test that is a combination of a FIT and markers for 
abnormal DNA ( 
53 
) (Cologuard; Exact Sciences; Boston, Mass). 
Th
 e Center for Medicaid & Medicare Services approved the test 
for reimbursement and recommends performance at 3-year inter-
vals. In a large screening colonoscopy study, patients underwent 
FIT, the combined FIT-fecal DNA test, and colonoscopy. Th
 e FIT-
fecal DNA test had a 1-time sensitivity for CRC of 92%. Th
 e FIT 
assay tested in the study had 73.8% sensitivity for cancer, suggest-
ing that most cancer sensitivity of the FIT-fecal DNA test can be 
achieved without addition of DNA markers. Advantages of the 
FIT-fecal DNA test include the highest single-time testing sensi-
tivity for cancer of any noninvasive, nonimaging CRC screening 
test. Also, the study demonstrated 40% sensitivity for SSPs >1 cm 
in size. Th
 e sensitivity of FIT for SSPs was equal to the false-
positive rate, indicating no sensitivity.
 
Th
 e major disadvantages of the FIT-fecal DNA test are a sub-
stantial decrease in specifi
 city (86.6% in persons with normal colo-
noscopy or nonadvanced lesions and 89.8% in those with normal 
colonoscopy), compared with 96% for the FIT test alone, and high 
cost relative to FIT. Specifi
 city decreased with increasing age and 
was only 83% in persons aged >65 years. Th
 e cost of the FIT-fecal 
DNA test is approximately $600 for privately insured patients and 
about $500 for Medicare patients, about 10 times the direct costs 
of annual FIT. Moreover, there is a further increase in relative costs 
related to higher numbers of colonoscopies per test. However, 
specifi
 city of every 3-year testing with the FIT-fecal DNA test may 
be approximately equal to the anticipated specifi
 city over 3 years 
of annual FIT testing. Th
 ere is currently no information regarding 
the programmatic sensitivity of the FIT-fecal DNA test.
 
Annual FIT is more eff
 ective and less costly than FIT-fecal 
DNA every 3 years ( 
87 
), so the FIT-fecal DNA test is unlikely to 
replace FIT in large organized screening programs. Th
 e FIT-fecal 
DNA test could be particularly appropriate for patients in the 
50- to 65-year age group who seek a noninvasive test with very 
high sensitivity for cancer, because the test has better specifi
 city 
in this age group. Available evidence suggests that asymptomatic 
patients with a positive FIT-fecal DNA test and a negative high-
quality colonoscopy do not need the colonoscopy repeated or 
evaluation of the remainder of the GI tract.
 
CT colonography
 
 
CT colonography has replaced double-contrast barium enema as 
the test of choice for colorectal imaging for nearly all indications. 
CT colonography is more eff
 ective than barium enema and better 
tolerated ( 
88,89 
).
 
Advantages of CT colonography include a lower risk of perfora-
tion compared with colonoscopy and sensitivity of 82 to 92% for 
adenomas ≥1 cm in size ( 
88–91 
). Disadvantages of CT colonog-
raphy include the use of bowel preparation in most centers in the 
United States. CT colonography can be performed with laxative-
free protocols, but this results in clear reductions in sensitivity rela-
tive to colonoscopy ( 
91 
), including for large polyps. Th
 e sensitivity 
of CT colonography for polyps <1 cm is less than colonoscopy 
( 
88–91 
), and detection of fl
 at ( 
92 
) and serrated lesions ( 
93 
) are 
major defi
 ciencies of CT colonography. Detection of extracolonic 
fi
 ndings by CT colonography is common, and these fi
 ndings have 
been classifi
 ed by the American College of Radiology according 
to their clinical relevance ( 
94 
). Radiation exposure is generally 
viewed as a disadvantage of CT colonography ( 
14 
). Evidence that 
CT colonography reduces CRC incidence or mortality is lacking.
 
Even in centers where CT colonography has long been available, 
the impact of CT colonography is limited. At one university, aft
 er 
full development of a CT colonography program, CT colonography 
accounted for about 10% of colorectal imaging studies, even with 
the availability of insurance coverage ( 
95,96 
). Primary care physi-
cians view the need for frequent follow-up colonoscopy examina-
tions and management of incidental extracolonic fi
 ndings as major 
factors limiting the utility of CT colonography ( 
96 
). In general,

Tools for patients to enhance colonoscopy quality 
 
Questions for patients to ask prospective colonoscopists to help ensure a 
high-quality examination 
  
1. What is your adenoma detection rate? (should be ≥25% overall or 
≥30% for male patients and ≥20% for female patients) 
  
2. What is your cecal intubation rate (should be ≥95% for screening 
colonoscopies and ≥90% overall) 
  
3. Do you use split-dosing of bowel preparations? (effective bowel prepa-
ration requires that at least half the preparation be ingested on the day of 
the colonoscopy) 
 
Checks of the endoscopy report after the procedure 
  
1. Does the report include photographs of the end of the colon, including 
the appendiceal orifi
 ce and ileocecal valve/terminal ileum? (this demon-
strates that the full extent of the colon was examined) 
  
2. Is the bowel preparation quality described? (the preparation must be 
adequate to ensure effective examination)

patients with a conventional adenoma ≥6 mm in size but was 
in 
eff
 ective for the detection of serrated lesions, and 9% of patients 
had technically failed examinations for inadequate cleansing or 
rapid transit of the capsule ( 
101 
).
 
Overall, the burden associated with bowel preparation and the 
relative superiority of colonoscopy are such that capsule colono-
scopy would be expected to appeal to a niche population con-
cerned about the risks of colonoscopy, in a fashion similar to CT 
colonography. Currently, lack of FDA approval for screening and 
lack of reimbursement are major obstacles to its use.
 
Septin9 assay
 
Th
 e fi
 rst FDA-approved serum test for CRC screening is the 
Septin9 assay (Epigenomics, Seattle, Wash). In a large screening 
colonoscopy study, this test had a sensitivity of 48% for detection 
of CRC and no sensitivity for detection of precancerous polyps 
( 
102 
). Th
 e test is expensive relative to FIT.
 
Th
 e advantage of the Septin9 test is that it is a serum assay and 
is at least potentially more convenient for patients. Some patients 
who refused colonoscopy preferred this test over FIT ( 
103 
).
 
Disadvantages of the Septin9 assay are markedly inferior 
performance characteristics compared with FIT, including lower 
sensitivity for cancer, inability to detect advanced adenomas ( 
104 
), 
and low cost-eff
 ectiveness relative to other screening tests ( 
105 
). 
Th
 e test appears to have higher sensitivity for late-stage compared 
with early-stage cancer ( 
102 
). Th
 e willingness of patients with 
positive Septin9 tests to undergo colonoscopy remains uncertain. 
Th
 e uncertainties regarding the true clinical utility of Septin 9 
makes shared decision-making diffi
  cult. Clinicians should inform 
patients of the uncertain benefi
 ts of this test on CRC mortality, the 
inability of the assay to detect polyps, and the array of superior 
alternatives. Th
 e best frequency for performing the test is uncer-
tain. Given these limitations, the MSTF suggests that Septin9 not 
be used for screening.
 
COST ISSUES
 
A consistent fi
 nding is that CRC screening by any available modal-
ity is cost-eff
 ective compared with no screening ( 
106,107 
), and in 
some models screening results in cost savings. Th
 is fi
 nding relates 
in part to the high costs of CRC treatment. Numerous modeling 
studies have addressed the relative cost-eff
 ectiveness of 2 or more 
screening tests. Th
 e conclusions of the models frequently vary, 
likely depending in part on the assumptions of the respective 
models. For example, diff
 erent models comparing colonoscopy 
and CT colonography have had variable conclusions ( 
108 
). Con-
sistent trends reveal that FIT performs well compared with other 
screening tests ( 
106,107,109 
). Colonoscopy also performs well 
in most models ( 
106–108,110 
), and, in general, the traditional 
tests are more cost-eff
 ective than the newer modalities, including 
CT colonography, FIT-fecal DNA, capsule colonoscopy, and the 
Septin9 assay ( 
105–107,111–113 
). Newer tests could reach cost-
eff
 ectiveness by substantially increasing compliance ( 
112,113 
), 
but evidence of improved compliance is lacking. Some models 
support the cost-eff
 ectiveness of risk-stratifi
 ed approaches to 
despite an extensive literature investigating the performance of 
CT colonography, the test has limited impact on CRC screening 
compliance ( 
95 
). However, CT colonography appeals to a niche 
of patients who are willing to undergo bowel preparation and are 
concerned about the risks of colonoscopy. When used, the recom-
mended interval is 5 years in patients with normal CT colono-
graphy. We continue to recommend that patients with polyps 
≥6 mm in size at CT colonography undergo colonoscopy ( 
1 
).
 
Flexible sigmoidoscopy
 
Randomized controlled trials confi
 rm reductions in distal colon 
or rectosigmoid cancer incidence and/or mortality of 29 to 76% 
with fl
 exible sigmoidoscopy ( 
66,97–99 
). Flexible sigmoidoscopy 
can prevent a small fraction (14%) of proximal colon cancers, if 
liberal criteria are used to indicate colonoscopy based on fl
 exible 
sigmoidoscopy fi
 ndings ( 
66 
). Advantages of fl
 exible sigmoidos-
copy include disproportionately lower cost and risk compared 
with colonoscopy, a more limited bowel preparation, and no need 
for sedation. Disadvantages of fl
 exible sigmoidoscopy include a 
lower benefi
 t in protection against right-sided colon cancer com-
pared with the level of protection achieved in case-control and 
cohort studies using colonoscopy. Also, the absence of sedation 
leads to a low satisfaction experience for patients, such that they 
are less willing to repeat the examination compared with colo-
noscopy ( 
100 
). Further, the concept of examining only part of the 
colon has been unpopular in the United States, so that screening 
by fl
 exible sigmoidoscopy has almost disappeared from oppor-
tunistic screening settings ( 
9 
). Some groups have endorsed the 
combination of fl
 exible sigmoidoscopy plus FIT for screening 
( 
14 
), but compliance challenges associated with completing 2 
screening tests and the dramatic decline in screening fl
 exible sig-
moidoscopy make signifi
 cant uptake of this combination unlikely.
 
Flexible sigmoidoscopy when used is oft
 en recommended at 
5-year intervals. However, endoscopic screening in general is more 
eff
 ective in the left
  than the right side of the colon, and there is 
no clear reason why fl
 exible sigmoidoscopy should not be recom-
mended at 10-year intervals, similar to the recommendation for 
colonoscopy. Th
 e MSTF considers that either 5- or 10-year inter-
vals are acceptable but favors 10-year intervals.
 
Capsule colonoscopy
 
Capsule colonoscopy has been approved by the FDA for imaging 
the proximal colon in patients with previous incomplete colonos-
copies and more recently for patients who need colorectal imaging 
but who are not candidates for colonoscopy or sedation. Capsule 
colonoscopy is not approved by the FDA for screening average-
risk persons. Advantages of capsule colonoscopy are the achieve-
ment of endoscopic imaging without an invasive procedure and 
avoiding the risks of colonoscopy. Disadvantages are that the 
bowel preparation is more extensive than that for colonoscopy. 
Also, because the logistics of performing same-day colonoscopy 
on patients with positive capsule studies are quite diffi
  cult, most 
patients with positive studies will require re-preparation and 
colonoscopy on a separate day. In a large screening trial in 884 
patients, capsule colonoscopy had 88% sensitivity for detecting

screening ( 
114 
). Screening remains cost-eff
 ective in patients into 
their mid-80s if they have few comorbidities and limited prior 
screening ( 
115,116 
).
 
QUALITY OF SCREENING
 
Variable performance of screening tests aff
 ects at least colono-
scopy, sigmoidoscopy, CT colonography, and FIT. Optimal results 
in CRC screening cannot be achieved without optimizing the 
technical performance and reporting of tests and ensuring that 
patients undergo appropriate follow-up aft
 er testing. Th
 e MSTF 
has made detailed recommendations regarding the technical per-
formance of FIT ( 
86 
) and has previously issued quality recommen-
dations regarding the technical performance of sigmoidoscopy 
( 
117 
) and colonoscopy ( 
118 
). Th
 e recommendations of the MSTF 
regarding quality in the technical performance of colonoscopy 
( 
118 
) were largely incorporated in quality recommendations from 
a combined American College of Gastroenterology-American 
Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Task Force on quality in 
2006 ( 
119 
) and 2015 ( 
120 
), and the MSTF endorses the American 
College of Gastroenterology-American Society for Gastrointesti-
nal Endoscopy Task Force recommendations.
 
Th
 e burden of performing high-quality FIT falls largely on 
primary care physicians and/or the healthcare systems in which 
they work. In the opportunistic setting there may not be resources 
allocated to systematically ensure that FIT-positive patients are 
referred for colonoscopy and that FIT-negative patients are off
 ered 
repeat testing or to monitor whether compliance with quality tar-
gets is adequate ( 
13 
). Inability to allocate resources to monitor the 
quality of FIT testing is a factor favoring reliance on sequential 
testing with colonoscopy the fi
 rst test off
 ered.
 
Unlike primary care physicians, the main role of gastroenterolo-
gists in the screening process is to perform colonoscopy on patients 
referred for primary colonoscopy screening or for colonoscopy to 
evaluate other positive screening tests. As such, a primary task of 
gastroenterologists is to perform high-quality colonoscopy and 
cost-eff
 ective follow-up. Th
 e adenoma detection rate, originally 
proposed by the MSTF in 2002 ( 
118 
), has emerged as the most 
important and highly variable measure of the quality of mucosal 
inspection during colonoscopy. Two large studies have validated 
the adenoma detection rate as a predictor of cancer prevention 
by colonoscopy ( 
67,68 
). Measurement of the adenoma detection 
rate is mandatory to appreciating whether a colonoscopist should 
be performing screening colonoscopy. Patients should expect a 
prospective colonoscopist to provide his or her adenoma detec-
tion rate, which should meet or exceed recommended minimum 
thresholds ( 
Table 3 
).
 
PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
 
No published randomized trials have directly compared and 
reported the relative eff
 ects of diff
 erent tests on CRC incidence or 
mortality. Several trials are ongoing, but results are not yet availa-
ble. When compared using simulation models that are dependent 
on assumptions about natural history of disease, patient accept-
ance of screening, and test performance, several tests appear to 
be similarly eff
 ective ( 
121 
). Th
 erefore, practical considerations are 
important for informing our recommendations.
 
A common statement made with regard to CRC screening is that 
“the best test is the one that gets done.” Th
 e MSTF endorses this 
concept because it is generally better for any person who is eligible 
to be screened to undergo some screening test rather than not be 
screened at all. On the other hand, the core concept underlying 
sequential testing is that off
 ering the “best” test (s) fi
 rst optimizes 
the sensitivity and/or cost-eff
 ectiveness of screening and still leaves 
the opportunity to off
 er other tests when patients decline. As an 
extreme example, the MSTF considers that equating the Septin9 
assay with colonoscopy would be a disservice to patients, because 
the sensitivity of colonoscopy for cancer and advanced lesions 
exceeds that of Septin9 by a very large margin. Given these dispari-
ties in the performance of individual tests, the MSTF groups the 
available tests into 3 tiers based on various performance features 
and costs ( 
Table 4 
).
 
Th
 e tier 1 tests representing the cornerstone of CRC screening 
are colonoscopy every 10 years and annual FIT ( 
Table 4 
). Th
 e 
use of these 2 tests as the primary screening measures provides a 
framework for screening that is simple and accommodates almost 
every screening setting. In organized programmatic screening FIT 
will oft
 en be off
 ered as the primary screen, but colonoscopy can 
be considered as an alternative for patients and physicians who 
prefer or request it. In the opportunistic setting, colonoscopy will 
oft
 en be preferred when the infrastructure to ensure annual per-
formance of FIT is not available. As noted above, 1 of the most 
challenging aspects of FIT screening in the opportunistic setting 
is ensuring repeated annual performance. Using a tier 1 approach 
that focuses on 2 tests makes the discussion of CRC screening tests 
between physician and patient manageable and feasible, and, as 
noted above, expanding the number of options in the initial dis-
cussion beyond 2 did not increase screening rates ( 
19 
). Colono-
scopy and FIT can be adapted readily to either the sequential off
 er 
of screening (colonoscopy is off
 ered fi
 rst with FIT reserved for

those who decline colonoscopy), the multiple-options approach 
(colonoscopy and FIT are each discussed with patients, and if both 
are declined the discussion moves sequentially to tier 2 tests), and 
the risk-stratifi
 ed approach (e.g., colonoscopy is off
 ered fi
 rst to 
men age >60 and women age >65 with no prior screening, and FIT 
is off
 ered to persons under these ages and persons with negative 
prior colonoscopy). Risk stratifi
 cation may also take into account 
factors such as cigarette smoking, diabetes, and obesity.
 
Th
 e rationale for placing tests in the tier 2 and 3 categories 
follows from the discussion above of individual tests. Th
 e rank-
ing implies equivalence for tests within each category, but this is 
not the intent of the MSTF. For example, fl
 exible sigmoidoscopy 
screening has strong evidence to support its use. However, the 
steady decline in the use of fl
 exible sigmoidoscopy in the United 
States ( 
9,10 
) suggests that any strong endorsement of fl
 exible sig-
moidoscopy is not consistent with the reality of the test’s lack of 
popularity among patients and poor reimbursement for physi-
cians. Th
 e strong evidence base supporting fl
 exible sigmoidoscopy 
leads us to place the test in the tier 2 category, although we expect 
that most practitioners using a sequential approach would move 
to CT colonography or FIT-fecal DNA in patients who decline 
colonoscopy and FIT, because these tests are less invasive and 
survey the entire colon.
 
Performance characteristics alone would place capsule colo-
noscopy in tier 2. However, off
 ering capsule colonoscopy as a 
tier 2 test in a sequential methodology currently would oft
 en 
lead to frustration because reimbursement for screening capsule 
colonoscopy is seldom available at this time, and the test itself 
is frequently not available. Th
 e onerous bowel preparation and 
the lack of systems to accomplish same-day colonoscopy in 
most patients with a positive capsule colonoscopy are additional 
factors placing capsule colonoscopy in the tier 3 category at this 
time.
 
In summary, we suggest that the tiered system ( 
Table 4 
) has 
numerous advantages. Predominant reliance on tier 1 tests off
 ers 
modalities with optimal eff
 ectiveness, cost-eff
 ectiveness, complete 
colon screening, proven popularity with patients, and a simpli-
fi
 ed discussion (compared with off
 ering 5-7 diff
 erent tests) and 
still leaves room to off
 er other tests in a sequential fashion. If 
patients decline colonoscopy and FIT, all tests in tier 2 are accept-
able CRC screening tests, but each has defi
 ciencies relative to the 
tier 1 tests.
 
Recommendations
 
1 
.  
We recommend colonoscopy every 10 years or annual FIT 
as fi
 rst-tier options for screening the average-risk persons 
for colorectal neoplasia (strong recommendation; moderate-
quality evidence). 
 
 
2 
.  
 
We recommend that physicians performing screening colo-
noscopy measure quality, including the adenoma detection 
rate (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). 
 
3 
.  
We recommend that physicians performing FIT monitor 
quality (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Th
 e 
recommended quality measurements for FIT programs are 
detailed in a prior publication ( 
86 
). 
 
4 
.  
We recommend CT colonography every 5 years or FIT-fecal 
DNA every 3 years (strong recommendation, low-quality 
evidence) or fl
 exible sigmoidoscopy every 5 to 10 years 
(strong recommendation, high-quality evidence) in patients 
who refuse colonoscopy and FIT. 
 
5 
.  
We suggest that capsule colonoscopy (if available) is an ap-
propriate screening test when patients decline colonoscopy, 
FIT, FIT-fecal DNA, CT colonography, and fl
 exible sigmoi-
doscopy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). 
 
 
6 
 
.  
 
 
We suggest against Septin9 for CRC screening (weak recom-
mendation, low-quality evidence). 
 
FAMILY HISTORY OF CRC AND POLYPS
 
We recommend that screening in most average-risk persons be 
initiated at age 50 years. A family history of CRC or certain pol-
yps can modify the recommended starting age and the frequency 
of screening. Th
 e MSTF has previously issued recommendations 
for screening in persons with Lynch syndrome ( 
34 
), which is a 
genetically defi
 ned inherited syndrome caused by mutations in 
1 or more mismatch repair genes. Patients in families that meet 
the clinical criteria for hereditary nonpolyposis CRC but have 
microsatellite-stable CRCs have family colon cancer syndrome X, 
which has not been genetically defi
 ned ( 
122 
). Persons in families 
with syndrome X should undergo colonoscopy at least every 3 to 5 
years, beginning 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the young-
est aff
 ected relative.
 
A family history of CRC in a fi
 rst-degree relative increases the 
risk of CRC regardless of the age at diagnosis of the aff
 ected rela-
tive ( 
123–125 
). Th
 ere is a gradient of risk such that the younger 
the age of the aff
 ected relative, the greater the risk ( 
123–125 
). 
Th
 e MSTF has previously used age 60 as a threshold of risk ele-
vation, so that a single fi
 rst-degree relative diagnosed with CRC 
at age <60 years warrants both earlier screening and at more-
frequent intervals ( 
1 
). Recent population-based studies ( 
123,124 
) 
and reviews of risk associated with a positive family history 
( 
125 
) support using age at diagnosis of CRC above or below 60 
years in the aff
 ected fi
 rst-degree relative as a risk stratifi
 er. We 
continue to recommend that persons with a family history of 
CRC in a fi
 rst-degree relative diagnosed at <60 years undergo 
colonoscopy every 5 years beginning at age 40 years or 10 years 
before the age the relative was diagnosed, whichever comes fi
 rst 
( 
Table 5 
). In a randomized controlled trial, there was a nonsig-
nifi
 cant trend toward detection of more advanced neoplasia in 
subjects with a positive family history who underwent colonos-
copy compared with FIT ( 
126 
). Th
 us, patients with a positive 
family history who decline colonoscopy should be off
 ered FIT 
screening ( 
126 
).
 
Th
 e greatest relative risk of CRC appears to be in persons <50 
years who have a fi
 rst-degree relative with CRC diagnosed at <50 
years ( 
123–125 
). Compliance in young persons with a family his-
tory of CRC is suboptimal, and clinicians should make special 
eff
 orts to ensure that screening occurs. Recent evidence suggests if 
persons with a single fi
 rst-degree relative with a family history of 
CRC reach the age of approximately 60 years without manifesting

signifi
 cant colorectal neoplasia ( 
127 
), then they are unlikely to be 
at increased risk of CRC and can be off
 ered the option of expand-
ing the interval between examinations.
 
When fi
 rst-degree relatives have documented advanced 
serrated lesions (SSPs ≥10 mm in size, or an SSP with cytologic 
dysplasia, or a traditional serrated adenoma ≥10 mm in size), there 
is no clear evidence as to how to proceed, unless the relative meets 
criteria for serrated polyposis ( 
46 
). Currently, we recommend 
that screening for fi
 rst-degree relatives of persons with advanced 
serrated lesions should be similar to the screening of fi
 rst-degree 
relatives of persons with advanced conventional adenomas.
 
Persons with a single fi
 rst-degree relative with CRC who was 
diagnosed at age ≥60 years are recommended to begin screen-
ing at 40 years ( 
128 
). However, the tests and intervals for testing 
are the same as the average-risk screening recommendations 
( 
Tables 4 and 5 
).
 
We no longer recommend that persons with a family history 
of adenomas in a fi
 rst-degree relative undergo early screening, 
unless there is clear documentation of an advanced adenoma 
in a fi
 rst-degree relative. In most cases the patient has no infor-
mation regarding whether the family member’s adenoma was 
advanced, and in this case we recommend that it be assumed 
the adenomas or polyps were not advanced. If a colonoscopy 
and/or pathology report (s) is available for a family member that 
documents an advanced adenoma or there is a report of a polyp 
requiring surgical resection, an advanced adenoma in a family 
member is considered established. Th
 ese considerations regarding 
adequate documentation of advanced precancerous neoplasms in 
fi
 rst-degree relatives before intensifying screening apply to docu-
mentation of both advanced adenomas and advanced serrated 
lesions. First-degree relatives with advanced adenomas are recom-
mended to be weighted the same as fi
 rst-degree relatives with CRC 
( 
Table 5 
). Th
 e yield of colonoscopic screening in fi
 rst-degree 
relatives of persons with advanced adenomas is substantially 
increased ( 
129–131 
).
 
Recommendations
 
1 
.  
We suggest that persons with 1 fi
 rst-degree relative with 
CRC or a documented advanced adenoma diagnosed at age 
<60 years or with 2 fi
 rst-degree relatives with CRC and/or 
documented advanced adenomas undergo colonoscopy every 
5 years beginning 10 years younger than the age at which 
the youngest fi
 rst-degree relative was diagnosed or age 40, 
whichever is earlier (weak recommendation, low-quality 
evidence). 
 
 
2 
 
.  
 
 
We suggest that persons with 1 fi
 rst-degree relative diagnosed 
with CRC or a documented advanced adenoma at age ≥60 
years begin screening at age 40. Th
 e options for screening 
and the recommended intervals are the same as those for 
average-risk persons (weak recommendation, very-low-
quality evidence). 
 
 
3 
 
.  
 
 
We suggest that persons with 1 or more fi
 rst-degree rela-
tives with a documented advanced serrated lesion (SSP or 
traditional serrated adenoma ≥10 mm in size or an SSP with 
cytologic dysplasia) should be screened according to above 
recommendations for persons with a family history of a 
documented advanced adenoma (weak recommendation, 
very-low-quality evidence). 
 
 
4 
 
.  
 
 
We recommend that persons with 1 or more fi
 rst-degree 
relatives with CRC or documented advanced adenomas, for 
whom we recommend colonoscopy, should be off
 ered annual 
FIT if they decline colonoscopy (strong recommendation, 
moderate-quality evidence). 
 
CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING AGE AND CRC RISK
 
 
CRC screening is recommended to begin at age 50 years in most 
average-risk persons, including in prior recommendations from 
the MSTF ( 
1 
). Recent modeling supports this recommendation 
( 
121 
). Several issues related to age and CRC risk warrant specifi
 c 
discussion.
 
Th
 e incidence of CRC is strongly age related and continues to 
rise with increasing age. Partly because of widespread screening 
in the United States, the incidence of CRC in falling by 3 to 4% 
per year in persons age ≥50 years ( 
12 
). Th
 e incidence of CRC in 
persons under age 50 is increasing in the United States ( 
132,133 
). 
Although the reasons for this rising incidence remain unclear and 
the relative incidence in persons under age 50 remains low, the 
increasing incidence of CRC in young people is a major public 
health concern.

Th
 e age to stop screening can be individualized. Screening 
is potentially benefi
 cial in persons up to age 86 if there has not 
been previous screening ( 
116 
) but should be considered in the 
context of comorbidities and life expectancy. Persons with pre-
viously nega 
tive screening tests, particularly negative screening 
colono 
scopy, could consider stopping at age 75 years ( 
14 
). In a 
variation of this recommendation, the MSTF has recommended 
that persons with previous negative screening stop when their life 
expectancy is less than 10 years ( 
1 
). Th
 us, the recommendation to 
stop screening can be reasonably based on patient age and comor-
bidities.
 
Th
 e wishes of the patient should be considered in uncertain 
cases. Th
 ese considerations do not necessarily apply in the surveil-
lance setting, where patients with advanced neoplasia may benefi
 t 
from surveillance colonoscopy even at an advanced age, depend-
ing on comorbidities and the confi
 dence in neoplasia clearing at 
colonoscopy.
 
Recommendations

We recommend that screening begin in non-African American 
average-risk persons at age 50 years (strong recommendation; 
moderate-quality evidence). 
 
 
2 
 
.  
 
 
We suggest that screening begin in African Americans at age 
45 years (weak recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). 
 
3 
.  
We recommend that adults age <50 years with colorectal 
bleeding symptoms (hematochezia, unexplained iron 
defi
 ciency anemia, melena with a negative upper endoscopy) 
undergo colonoscopy or an evaluation suffi
  cient to determine 
a bleeding cause, initiate treatment, and complete follow-up 
to determine resolution of bleeding (strong recommendation, 
moderate-quality evidence). 
 
4 
.  
We suggest that persons who are up to date with screening 
and have negative prior screening tests, particularly colono-
scopy, consider stopping screening at age 75 years or when 
life expectancy is less than 10 years (weak recommendation, 
low-quality evidence). 
 
5 
.  
We suggest that persons without prior screening should be 
considered for screening up to age 85, depending on consid-
eration of their age and comorbidities (weak recommenda-
tion, low-quality evidence). 
 
SUMMARY
 
CRC screening should begin at age 50 years in asymptomatic per-
sons. Colonoscopy every 10 years and annual FIT are currently 
the fi
 rst considerations for screening. Colonoscopy every 10 years 
has advantages in the opportunistic screening setting. Annual FIT 
is likely to be preferred in organized screening programs. Posi-
tioning of the 2 tests can be reasonably based on a sequential off
 er 
(colonoscopy fi
 rst with FIT off
 ered to patients who decline colo-
noscopy, followed by second-tier tests for patients who decline 
FIT), a multiple-options approach where both tests are discussed 
with patients (followed by a sequential off
 er of second-tier tests 
to patients who decline both colonoscopy and FIT), or a risk-
stratifi
 ed approach (colonoscopy is off
 ered to patients with a 
 
Th
 e best course of action with regard to the rising incidence of 
CRC in young people is currently not certain. When a young per-
son develops fatal CRC, the loss of life years is great. Th
 e fi
 rst step 
in reducing CRC morbidity and mortality in persons age <50 years 
is aggressive evaluation (usually colonoscopy) of patients with 
colorectal symptoms, specifi
 cally those with bleeding symptoms: 
hematochezia, iron defi
 ciency anemia, and/or melena with a nega-
tive upper endoscopy. Persons with bleeding symptoms evaluated 
with tests other than colonoscopy (e.g., sigmoidoscopy) should 
have a bleeding source identifi
 ed and treated, and the patient 
should be followed to resolution of the symptom. Patients who 
have nonbleeding symptoms (e.g., abnormal bowel habit, change 
in bowel habit or shape, or abdominal pain) and who have no evi-
dence of bleeding do not have an increased risk of CRC when they 
undergo colonoscopy ( 
134,135 
).
 
Th
 ere is currently insuffi
  cient evidence to recommend system-
atic screening in asymptomatic persons <50 years old who lack 
specifi
 c risk factors related to family history or Lynch syndrome. 
Th
 e yield of screening colonoscopy in this age group is low in 
available studies ( 
136 
), and the biologic reasons for the increas-
ing incidence of CRC in persons under age 50 years are uncertain. 
Additional study of the benefi
 ts and harms of screening in per-
sons <50 years is warranted, perhaps particularly in persons with 
known colorectal risk factors such as cigarette smoking, diabetes 
mellitus, and obesity ( 
137–139 
).
 
Relative to other races, African Americans have lower 
screening rates for CRC, higher incidence rates, earlier mean 
age at onset, worse survival and late-stage presentation, and a 
higher proportion of cancers before age 50 ( 
140–143 
). Th
 ese 
various eff
 ects result from both socioeconomic and biologic 
factors ( 
144 
). Two of the member organizations of the MSTF 
endorsed beginning average-risk screening in African Ameri-
cans at age 45 ( 
22,145 
), and the American College of Physi-
cians recommended beginning at age 40 ( 
146 
). Th
 e scientifi
 c 
rationale for beginning screening earlier includes the higher 
overall incidence rates and younger mean age at onset of CRC 
in African Americans ( 
140–143 
). A recent joinpoint regression 
analysis ( 
147 
) and a MISCAN-Colon microsimulation model 
( 
148 
) both supported screening African Americans approxi-
mately 5 years earlier compared with whites. Th
 ere are few data 
on the yield of screening in African Americans before age 50 or 
whether earlier screening improves outcomes. In persons over 
age 50, some reports have identifi
 ed a higher risk of advanced 
polyps in African Americans ( 
149 
). Th
 e recommendations to 
begin screening earlier have served an important role in stimu-
lating discussion of and research on CRC in African Ameri-
cans, increasing awareness in physicians of an important public 
health problem and racial disparity in health outcomes in the 
United States, and increasing awareness of CRC in African 
Americans. Increasing screening rates in African Americans 
generally is an area of obvious importance. Provider recom-
mendation is key ( 
150 
), and navigation can improve compli-
ance to colonoscopy screening ( 
151 
). Additional study of the 
yield of screening in persons under age 50 is needed, particu-
larly in African Americans.

higher pretest probability of neoplasia, and FIT is used in persons 
with a lower pretest probability of neoplasia).
 
Persons with a history of CRC or a documented advanced 
adenoma in a fi
 rst-degree relative age <60 years or 2 fi
 rst-degree 
relatives with these fi
 ndings at any age are recommended to 
undergo screening by colonoscopy every 5 years, beginning 10 
years before the age at diagnosis of the youngest aff
 ected rela-
tive, or at age 40, whichever is earlier. Persons with a single fi
 rst-
degree relative diagnosed at ≥60 years with CRC or an advanced 
adenoma can be off
 ered average-risk screening options begin-
ning at age 40 years.
 
Th
 e incidence of CRC is rising in persons under age 50. Patients 
under age 50 with bleeding symptoms consistent with a colorectal 
source should be aggressively evaluated and treated. We suggest 
that screening begin at age 45 in African Americans. Discontinu-
ation of screening should be considered when patients who are 
up to date with screening and have had negative screening tests, 
particularly colonoscopy, reach age 75 years or when life expec-
tancy is <10 years. Persons without prior screening should be con-
sidered for screening up to age 85 years, depending on comorbid 
conditions and life expectancy.
