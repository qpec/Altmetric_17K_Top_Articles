PURPOSE. To describe a spectral imaging system for small animal studies based on noninvasive
endoscopy of the retina, and to present time-resolved spectral changes from live Alzheimer’s
mice prior to cognitive decline, corroborating our previous in vitro findings.
METHODS. Topical endoscope fundus imaging was modified to use a machine vision camera
and tunable wavelength system for acquiring monochromatic images across the visible to
near-infrared spectral range. Alzheimer’s APP/PS1 mice and age-matched, wild-type mice were
imaged monthly from months 3 through 8 to assess changes in the fundus reflection
spectrum. Optical changes were fit to Rayleigh light scatter models as measures of amyloid
aggregation.
RESULTS. Good quality spectral images of the central retina were obtained. Short-wavelength
reflectance from Alzheimer’s mice retinae showed significant reduction over time compared
to wild-type mice. Optical changes were consistent with an increase in Rayleigh light
scattering in neural retina due to soluble Ab1–42 aggregates. The changes in light scatter
showed a monotonic increase in soluble amyloid aggregates over a 6-month period, with
significant build up occurring at 7 months.
CONCLUSIONS. Hyperspectral imaging technique can be brought inexpensively to the study of
retinal changes caused by Alzheimer’s disease progression in live small animals. A similar
previous finding of reduction in the light reflection over a range of wavelengths in isolated
Alzheimer’s mice retinae, was reproducible in the living Alzheimer’s mice. The technique
presented here has a potential for development as an early Alzheimer’s retinal diagnostic test
in humans, which will support the treatment outcome.

A
lzheimer’s disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative
disorder whose socioeconomic burden is estimated as 14
million Americans aged older than 65 years by 2050.1 A
pathognomonic indicator of this protein folding disorder is the
deposition of amyloid plaques in synapses and around neuronal
cells. A second pathognome is neurofibrillary tangles of
hyperphosphorylated s protein.2 The disease leads to net loss
of brain weight and volume, which can be ascribed to
generalized loss of neuronal processes. The cerebral cortex
and hippocampus are particularly affected.3
No clinical diagnostics currently exist for detecting AD prior
to amyloidopathy or mild cognitive impairment. Confirmation
of AD is possible only during postmortem autopsy. Currently,
diagnosis of ‘‘probable’’ AD is possible only when the condition
has progressed, and considerable irreversible neurological
damage has already occurred. By the stage at which overt
plaques are visible using positron emission tomography (PET)
imaging,4 cognition is already impaired. Assessment of risk for
AD at an earlier stage would open a window of opportunity for
therapeutic possibilities that harbor the promise of retarding or
even halting the disease progression. Such an assessment would
undoubtedly assist in the development of new interventions
aimed at preventing or delaying the AD progression. In recent
years, there has been much progress in the field of AD
diagnostics and biomarker identification, including genetic,
blood biomarkers, cerebrospinal fluid proteomics, and neuro-
imaging. Development of AD is influenced by the ‘‘risk’’ genes
that increase the bearer’s likelihood of developing AD (e.g.,
through apolipoprotein E–e4 dysfunctions5) and the ‘‘deter-
ministic’’ genes that directly generate known pathognomones
such as mutant presenilin 1 and 2.6 A panel of possible plasma
biomarkers for AD has been reported.7 Analyses of cerebrospi-
nal fluid (CSF) has provided a potentially utile source of reliable
AD biomarkers (e.g., CSF titers of amyloid Ab1–42, phosphor-
ylated and total s-peptides that have shown marked correlation
with AD progression).8,9 In brain tissue, Ab plaques have been
imaged in Alzheimer’s patients using PET with 11[C]-PiB and
18[F]-radiolabeled ligands.10,11 Techniques such as PET imaging
can help to identify AD, but the sheer expense of the
procedure, exposure to radionuclides, and limited facilities
render it an unlikely primary screen for AD.12
There exists a need for an AD diagnostic for detection of the
disease prior to any cognitive decline. Current focus is on
technologies that can detect biomarkers located elsewhere in
the body. The retina is both developmentally and anatomically,
a part of the CNS. It can easily be accessed for imaging in vivo
by a noninvasive method.13 Visual deficiency/performance
problems are a common early complaint of AD patients.14
However, none of these deficiencies are themselves unique to
AD symptomology. There is a hope that the eye might lend

 biomarkers that are AD-specific and would provide an early
diagnosis even before any changes happen in the brain. Retinal
morphological changes have been the subject of investigation
over the last decade. Changes to the retinal vasculature and
optic disc,15,16 retinal cell loss,17,18 and thinning of the retinal
nerve fiber layer (RNFL) have been observed in AD, but were
nonspecific to the disease.19 Advancement of the AD eye test
from NeuroVision Imaging (Sacramento, CA, USA) into clinical
trials is encouraging.20 It utilizes retinal fluorescence photog-
raphy to scan the supranuclear region of the retina for a
fluorescent signature characteristic of Ab plaques. Unfortu-
nately, it requires administration of curcumin prior to imaging,
which binds to the plaques.21
Recently, in an ex vivo study of transgenic Alzheimer’s mice
(APP/PS1),22 we showed through hyperspectral dark-field
microscopy that there exist certain optical property aberra-
tions of the retina that are unique to AD pathology, correlated
with AD progression, and occur before retinal plaques can be
observed. Specifically, optical signals consistent with Rayleigh
light scattering changes were observed in the spectrum from
whole mount APP/PS1 mice retinas and their age-matched
counterparts. This could be attributed to optical characteristics
of retinal tissue being influenced by the assemblies of Ab1-42
molecules ranging from soluble colloidal form to insoluble
plaques.22 Many globular clusters that are early aggregation
products of Ab peptides are small compared with the optical
wavelength and obey Rayleigh scattering theory. Since the
Rayleigh scatter intensity is proportional to the inverse fourth
power of wavelength,23 buildup of small plaque precursor
molecules can reduce the amount of short wavelength light
obtained in reflected light recordings from the retina, resulting
in a unique optical signature for early-stage AD. Rayleigh
scattering is expected to be the dominant mechanism since the
Ab peptide scattering structure is much smaller than the
optical wavelength.
The primary aim of the present live animal experiment was
to determine if optical signals reported previously from flat-
mount retinal preparations and Ab1-42 exposed cell culture22
could be detected in live Alzheimer’s mice, and to ascertain if
the live spectral signature matches the in vitro signature. The
answer to these questions will show translation of our in vitro
findings into the living system and ultimately to a noninvasive
method for early-stage diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease prior to
cognitive decline. To carry out this work, we adapted the
topical endoscopic fundus imaging (TEFI) of Paques and
colleagues24 for imaging the mouse fundus. The advantages
of this method over conventional fundus photography are its
low cost, good image quality, and stability over time. The
method has been employed successfully for diverse studies,
including color-video documentation of the retinal vascular
structure,25 panretinal imaging of ocular inflammation,26,27 and
fluorescence imaging of optogenetic probes.28 Here we
describe the new spectral imaging method and its use, and
present results of optical signals produced by light-scatter
changes in transgenic Alzheimer’s mice with age, which may
serve as a marker for buildup of amyloid aggregates in the
retina.
METHODS
Mice
Wild type (B6C3F1J) and APP/PS1 double transgenic Alz-
heimer’s mice (APPswe/PS1DE9) used in the present study
were acquired from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA)
at the ages of 6 to 10 weeks. Eight mice were used per
treatment group. All experimental procedures and animal
handling were approved by the University of Minnesota Animal
Care and Use Committee and were executed in accordance
with the national ethics guidelines. All the animal procedures
were in accordance with the ARVO Statement for the Use of
Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. For all experi-
ments, animals were housed three per cage in our facility, in a
controlled environment (temperature, 228C; humidity, 50%–
60%; and light from 7 AM to 7 PM); food and water were
available ad libitum.
Hyperspectral Endoscopy System
Our method for spectroscopic observation in live mice is easily
implemented with noninvasive fundus endoscopy. We modi-
fied the usual TEFI imaging method to enable us to record a
series of images in rapid succession covering wavelengths from
480 to 705 nm. The live mouse imager (CytoViva, Inc., Auburn,
AL, USA), described below, combines spatial and spectral
information into a single hyperspectral image, which allows
optical spectra from individual points in a sampled area to be
examined. For this study, fundus images were acquired using a
5-cm gradient index (GRIN) lens otoscope with a crescent-
shaped fiber illuminator on the side of the 3-mm diameter tip
(type 1218 AA; Karl Storz Endoscopy, Tuttlingen, Germany).
The eye receives diverging rays exiting from the side of the
endoscope while light is returned from the eye by diffuse
fundus reflection. The illumination path and center of the
GRIN lens are separated by 1.3 mm as shown in Figure 1A,
resulting in different angles for view and light input. A dual-slit
scanning monochromator (model 9030; Science Tech, Inc.,
Toronto, Canada) was employed to obtain monochromatized
illumination (15-nm bandwidth), which could be programmat-
ically tuned between 400 and 800 nm (Fig. 1). Spectral
resolution is easily changed by using slits of different width.
White light from a 150-W halogen fiber-optic light source
(Fiber-Lite; Dolan-Jenner Industries, Boxborough, MA, USA)
was coupled to the input port of the monochromator with a 5-
mm liquid light guide (Newport Corp. Irvine, CA, USA). The

endoscope. Section through the eye center showing recorded light rays
(short dashes) and illuminating rays (long dashes). A portion of
illumination is eclipsed by the pupil. The ray below the eye (short
dash) shows the symmetric light pattern from the fiber optic. The
arrangement is sensitive to both absorption and light scatter with rays
entering asymmetrically over an angular spread of just under 458 while
imaged light returns symmetrically about the central axis with a
maximum angle of 178. Angled illumination also reduces the pickup of
light reflecting from boundaries between tissue layers, such as the
internal limiting membrane of the retina. (B) The imaging train begins
with the endoscope tip that encloses a GRIN lens. The endoscope
image is refocused at the camera using a TV lens (see text). Illumination
from a halogen source passes through a monochromator before
entering the endoscope fiber illuminator. Image acquisition and
wavelength scanning are controlled from a laptop.

 monochromatic light output was then coupled into the
illumination optics of the endoscope using a 5-mm fluid light
cable (Karl Storz Endoscopy). The endoscope was attached to a
translating stage (model PT1; ThorLabs, Newton, NJ, USA),
which also held a machine vision camera system (Pixelfly;
PCO-Tech, Romulus, MI, USA), having 14-bit grayscale resolu-
tion in a 1392 3 1024 pixel, 2/3’’ image format (Fig. 2). The
stage provided a 1-inch travel, controlled with a micrometer
screw, which enabled gently moving the tip of the endoscope
toward the corneal surface while progress was monitored with
video. The endoscope image was relayed by a 50-mm f/1.4
objective lens (Nikon, Inc., Tokyo, Japan), which enabled the
full field of the endoscope to be picked up by the camera. Eye
safety was checked by measuring the power density (570 nm)
at the endoscope tip with a digital power meter (Extech
Instruments, Waltham, MA, USA). The measured reading of 160
lW/cm2 would indicate approximately 10 lW reaching the
retina, assuming a 2.8-mm dilated mouse pupil. This is
considered a safe level of eye exposure based on International
Electrotechnical Commission 60825 values for maximum
permissible exposure.29
Imaging Procedure
The procedure described by Koronyo-Hamaoui et al.21 was
followed with some modifications as described. Briefly, retinas
of live APP/PS1 and age-matched, wild-type (WT) mice were
imaged after anesthetization with 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10
mg/kg xylazine intraperitoneally (IP) in sterile saline. A local
anesthetic (proparacaine) was applied to the corneal surface
prior to dilation of mouse pupils (2–3 mm diameter) with 2.5%
phenylephrine hydrochloride (Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY,
USA) and 1.0% tropicamide (Mydral; Bausch & Lomb)
ophthalmic solution. Mouse eyes were covered with lubricant
eye gel (GenTeal Hypromellose ophthalmic gel, 0.3%; Akorn,
Lake Forest, IL, USA) for contact imaging. Care was taken to
keep anesthetized animals warm throughout the procedure
using warming pads. Mice were returned to their cages and
monitored until the effects of the ketamine have completely
subsided. These mice were sedated for imaging up to once per
week using IP ketamine, if necessary.
For imaging, the anesthetized mouse was placed on a
laboratory jack surface that allowed raising and lowering the
animal (Fig. 2). The tip of the endoscope was brought near the
cornea and coarsely aligned with the center. To aid fine
alignment, illumination at 570 nm was turned on to flood the
anterior eye, while video was monitored as the tip was
advanced until iris reflections fell outside the view area. At this
setting, a view of the posterior retina is obtained with the optic
disc centered or slightly off to one side. Upon acquisition of a
stable retinal image, the wavelength sequence was started to
obtain a series of 16 images from 480 to 705 nm at 15-nm
intervals, a process needing approximately 20 seconds. Each
image was taken by the image acquisition program using an
external trigger signal sent immediately after switching to the
next wavelength. The image sequence was reviewed after
recording and then saved as a tagged image file format image
stack.
Data Analysis
Dark values were subtracted and reflection spectra were then
extracted from stacks with a z-axis profile tool using ImageJ
(http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/; provided in the public domain by
the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) macro
language. The retinal reflection spectrum was sampled using
50 3 50 pixel averages at six positions in relatively bright
regions away from nerve fibers and the large vessels. Spectra
from measurement sites were averaged to give mean spectral
curves for WT and Alzheimer’s groups, at each age. These time-
resolved reflection spectra were then normalized to unity
values at 705 nm—which is outside the range where
Alzheimer’s-dependent spectral changes were previously ob-
served—so that they could be compared.
Changes in light scattering and absorption were identified
from optical density spectra. Optical densities in APP/PS1 mice
were found using Equation 1,
ODðkÞ ¼ log10 SWTðkÞ=SADðkÞ
½
�
ð1Þ
where SWT(k) and SAD(k) represent age-matched, normalized
reflection spectral amplitudes from wild-type and Alzheimer’s
study groups. This definition gives the relative tissue optical
density from the AD group with respect to that of the age-
matched WT group used as a baseline reference. The term
‘‘optical density’’ (OD) refers to the increment in OD between
the study groups. We refer to changes in this value with age as
‘‘optical density change.’’ Factors related to age, such as
changes in melanin concentration or the number of previous
imaging sessions that could affect ocular transmission, do not
contribute to the OD in Equation 1. The value of our OD is zero
if the AD and WT groups give the same reflected light
spectrum, as would be the case if light scattering and
absorption in the retina, and structures anterior, were identical
in both groups. Melanin concentration would most likely
average to the same value in both of our study groups, hence
we would not expect Equation 1 to produce a spectrum with
melanin as one of its components (Supplementary Material Fig.
S1). Since retinal blood density can differ between WT and AD
groups, light absorption by the blood could partially mask the
light scatter spectrum. Therefore, we accounted for blood light
absorption in our analysis. We used nonlinear curve fitting
(Excel Solver; Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA) to fit
measured optical densities of Equation 1 to a model for
Rayleigh light scatter, with a term added for hemoglobin light
absorption,
ODfitðkÞ ¼ Ak�4 þ BHbðkÞ
ð2Þ
where A and B are fitting parameters, k�4 is the wavelength
dependence for Rayleigh light scatter, and Hb(k) is the
hemoglobin spectrum when blood oxygen saturation is
60%,30 which approximates the average saturation of postcap-

 illary blood. Model estimates of Rayleigh scatter and blood
absorption were determined from the right-side terms of
Equation 2. Figure 3 shows the relationship between measured
optical density from Equation 1 and the model predictions,
along with the residual curve (OD � ODfit) for age 7 months.
This method separates the contributions of light scatter and
blood to allow a more accurate measure of the scatter
component to use as a measure of amyloid aggregation.
Goodness-of-fit to experimental curves was determined
from the coefficient of determination, R2. Statistical signifi-
cance between groups was found using an unpaired t-test for
the difference between WT and APP/PS1 for measured optical
density (Equation 1) at 480 nm, the wavelength most affected
by amyloid aggregation The amyloid aggregation over time was
characterized by fitting the scattering values at 480 nm to a
sigmoidal function (computed by Microcal Origin 6.0; Origin-
Lab Corp, Northampton, MA, USA). The sigmoidal growth is
described by Equation 3,
ODgrowthð480 nm; tÞ ¼ L
�
1 þ expð � sðt � t0ÞÞ
�
ð3Þ
where L is the curve’s maximum value, s gives the steepness of
the curve, and t0 is the midpoint of the curve.
The accuracy of our comparison of retinal spectra
depended on the reproducibility of our recordings. It was
important to insure there was no damage to the anterior eye
from pressure or excessive exposure to light. Care was taken to
use the minimum illumination during initial alignments and to
apply illumination only over the time to complete spectral
imaging. The data comparisons for calculating statistical
significance were not corrected for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS
The newly developed contact-imaging system with the
wavelength scanning capability was employed in the imaging
of live transgenic Alzheimer’s and WT mice. The performance
of the contact fundus imaging with the endoscope was
examined previously for color video and fluorescence imag-
ing.31 Our imaging experiments yielded monochromatic retinal
images over a spectral range from 480 to 705 nm. The
brightness and contrast of veins, arteries, nerve fibers, and
choroid capillaries (Fig. 4) appear to depend on the
wavelength of illumination. In blue light (510 nm, upper left,
Fig. 4), nerve fibers spreading from the optic disc strongly
reflect light. In green light (555 nm, upper right, Fig. 4) where
hemoglobin light absorption is strong, retinal blood vessels
appear dark against the fundus background, the veins being
darker than the arteries due to their relatively higher content of
deoxyhemoglobin. The spectral image also shows a reversal in
the vessel contrast, from darker to brighter, between green
(555 nm) to red (615 nm) wavelengths. In red and near
infrared light (615 and 705 nm, lower left and right), both
vessel types now appear bright against the background. These
changes result from the absorption and scattering properties of
the blood column and from specular reflections at vessel
center lines. In the brown mouse, image details were largely
dependent upon the wavelength: below 600 nm, image
contrast was from retinal structures; while above 600 nm
where melanin absorption is weaker, the retinal features were
less pronounced. In nonpigmented white mice, the choroidal
structures were seen across the spectrum (Supplementary
Material Fig. S2). These retinal images were of higher intensity
than those in brown mice due to the difference in the eye
pigmentation.
Figure 5 shows optical spectra obtained from human and
mouse retina. For the purpose of comparison, all spectra were
normalized to unity at 705 nm where the effect of light scatter
is relatively small. In Figure 5A (left panel) the upper pair of
spectra were recorded from human retinal whole mounts
obtained postmortem from an individual diagnosed with AD
(solid line, n ¼ 1) and an age-matched control subject (dashed
line, n ¼ 1). These are mean spectra averaged over multiple
areas of the retina. The retinal spectral signature from the
Alzheimer’s patient with confirmed AD diagnosis showed
reduced spectral amplitudes at shorter wavelengths compared
with those from the age-matched normal individual. The lower
pair of spectra are from live APP1/PS1 mice (solid line, n ¼ 8)
and live WT mice (short dashed line, n ¼ 8) at age 7 months.
This is the time point when the difference between
Alzheimer’s and WT spectra reached statistical significance (P
< 0.5). Both human and mouse spectra exhibit similar features,
including a broad range of reflected wavelengths and a

 reduction of the Alzheimer’s spectrum which strengthens
going toward shorter wavelengths. This last spectral compo-
nent corresponds to light loss by scatter which is modeled in
Equation 2. The relative reduction in the Alzheimer’s spectral
amplitude was approximately the same in human (33%) and
mouse (31%). Mouse spectra appear smoother because the
recording was made with lower spectral resolution. Mouse
spectra also reveal the presence of blood circulation by the
small dip near 550 nm. We note that the human spectra were
obtained using transmitted light in a dark-field microscope
recording and live mouse spectra were obtained with reflected
light (see the Methods section). In Figure 5B (right panel),
mouse spectra from Figure 5A are shown with standard
deviations at each wavelength. At wavelengths below 570 nm,
the separation of means is greater than the standard deviation
from each group.
Figure 6A (top panels) shows the changes in optical density
(Equation 1) from live retinal images at 1-month intervals,
starting at age 3 months. In earlier months, months 3 and 4, the
OD curves were flat. An increase in spectral amplitude was
evident at the age of 5 months, which rises progressively over
the rest of the study. Beginning at 6 months, a broad peak near
550 nm was superimposed on the OD curve. This increase in
OD is from a change in the volume of retinal blood, whose
absorption band coincides with these wavelengths. Figure 6B
(bottom panels) shows curve fits that were obtained using the
Rayleigh scatter and blood absorption terms in Equation 2. The
scatter component (solid line) of the optical density increased
progressively over the course of this study. The presence of
blood absorption (dashed line) was apparent at age 6 months
and remained nearly constant after its first appearance. The
appearance of the blood spectrum is consistent with an
increase in retinal blood volume in the APP1/PS1 mouse
relative to that of the WT mouse. Goodness-of-fits listed above
each panel in Figure 6B rise to near unity at month five and
remained constant for the rest of the study. Model fits at 480
nm also fell within the error of the measured OD except at 8
months, where the model prediction (0.143 OD units) was 6%
below the lower error (0.153 OD units). The Table represents a
summary of the above results in numerical form.
The time course of amyloid aggregation (solid bars) over the
duration of this study is displayed in Figure 7, the degree of
amyloid aggregation is assessed from the strength of Rayleigh
light scatter at 480 nm. Rayleigh scattering is strongest at this
wavelength, thus we use this value as our marker for degree of
aggregation. A monotonic increase in the modelled optical
density function was observed, resulting in a statistically
significant difference between APP1/PS1 and WT at 7 and 8
months (P < 0.0001). The trend in light scatter fitted a
sigmoidal growth curve (dotted line). This growth model (S
parameter) predicts that by 8 months, the light scatter signal is
near its maximum value of 0.148 6 0.004 optical density units,
with a midpoint of growth (t0 parameter) at 6.18 6 0.05
months. The amount of the optical density contributed by
blood absorption (evaluated from the blood absorption model
at 480 nm) is shown with open bars. There is a relatively
sudden onset of increased blood volume in the APP1/PS1
retina that does not continue to rise over the remaining course
of the study. An attribution of optical density changes to
amyloid aggregation is supported by this numerical analysis.
DISCUSSION
We have described a method for spectroscopic analysis of
retinal features in small animals using TEFI in conjunction with
a spectrally tuned light source. The imaging system has
sufficient spatial resolution to clearly show retinal nerve fibers
and major vessels in visible through near infrared wavelengths.
Our present spectral resolution of approximately 15 nm (2-mm
slit width) is appropriate for the broadband light scattering
signal that was found previously from tissue sections with
hyperspectral microscopy. A grating monochromator design
was chosen since its optical bandwidth is fixed across the
tunable range of wavelengths, as it also was for the microscope
hyperspectral system22 with which the current results are
being compared. Since our wavelength selection is accom-

 plished through the use of a grating, wavelength dispersion is
linear and the optical passband is constant over wavelength. A
liquid crystal tuned filter in place of the monochromator would
permit faster wavelength switching, but spectral resolution
would be limited to approximately 7 nm and would vary over
wavelength. The present method provides a simple and
inexpensive solution to spectral imaging with small animals.
The 3-mm endoscope gives excellent results in white mice,
where the fundal reflectance is relatively high, and in older
brown mice where the dilated pupil is large enough to accept
the light crescent emerging from the endoscope. We found in
younger brown mice that the fundus reflectance was reduced,
but was of a magnitude still usable for quantitative imaging.
Optical changes from live transgenic mice were consistent
with those in Ab1-42 incubated cells and in retinal tissue
sections obtained posthumously from Alzheimer’s patients22
suggesting a common cause. We note that our earlier in vitro
recordings were made from transmitted light that was
scattered from the retina with the direct illumination blocked
(dark-field microscopy), while the present live recordings were
of diffuse retinal reflectance obtained using an off-angle light
source (TEFI endoscopy). Both types of recording have several
characteristics in common: the probe light becomes diffused
after undergoing multiple scattering within the tissue; only
light scattered from tissue is measured; and in both cases, light
intensity was reduced at shorter wavelengths in the Alz-
heimer’s group. In our earlier dark-field recordings from retinal
whole mounts, the situation is similar to dark-field microscopy
in Ab1-42 incubated cells, where multiple scattering is required
for some of the light to reach the detector. On this path toward
measurement, Rayleigh scatter effects would operate (Supple-
mentary Material Fig. S3). In the eye, light entering the retina
would interact with structures of differing size and refractive
index, including blood and neural cell components, and higher
order Ab oligomers. These interactions can produce Mie
scattering, where light is deflected in the forward direction
through small angles.32 As this process repeats multiple times,
the light paths become isotropic, causing some of the light to
be returned from the retina (Supplementary Material Fig. S4
and Table S1). On the return path, Rayleigh scattering from
smaller Ab oligomers would deflect light to the side, away from
the path of return, excluding it from the recorded spectrum.
Since Rayleigh scattering efficiency increases as wavelength
decreases, the spectrum of measured light will show a

 progressive loss of intensity toward shorter wavelengths. A
buildup of amyloid aggregations products could thus result in
the changes obtained over time in the Alzheimer’s mouse. We
cannot prove that the spectral changes observed in live
recordings originated in a single retinal layer; however,
similarity between in vitro and live signals suggests that they
have a common source and the geometry suggests the inner
retina contributes to the signal.
We have employed a model for Rayleigh light scatter to
describe in part the measured optical density of the retina. We
do not imply that the optical signature is from Raleigh
scattering alone; Mie scattering phenomenon are no doubt
involved. But only the large deflections produced by Rayleigh
scatter and the particular wavelength dependence of this effect
can explain our result. We note that the magnitude of our
fitting parameter for Rayleigh scatter (A in Equation 2)
increased monotonically with the age of the mice. The amyloid
aggregation plot in Figure 7 provides target values for the
optical density changes, based on the scatter model, that are
associated with the aggregation process. Alternatively, the
value of the Rayleigh fitting parameter, or area under the OD
curve, could serve as a monitor of early-stage disease
progression. A sigmoidal shape for the growth curve of Figure
7 suggests that rates of accumulation of Ab-aggregates begin to
slow after 6 months, as would be expected as smaller
aggregates form into higher order Ab oligomers and insoluble
plaques without Rayleigh scatter properties. This behavior was
first observed by using SH-SY5Y cells exposed to Ab1-42
peptide, where light extinction first increased to a maximum
value and then began reducing to initial value.22
We note that over the course of this study the light scatter
changes increased monotonically, becoming more obvious after
5 months, while APP/PS1 mouse blood volume increased
abruptly after light scattering changes were in progress. We
thus feel confident that the predominant origin of scatter is not
from capillary blood. The ex vivo and live imaging outcomes,
taken together, suggest that early stages of Ab peptide
aggregation can be detected from retinal light-scatter changes,
without the addition of fluorescent labels. Techniques with
demonstrated promise in measurement of the RNFL and
topography changes, such as optical coherence tomography33
and retinal fluorescence lifetime imaging,34 could potentially be
excellent complimentary methods to retinal hyperspectral
imaging for yielding physical parameters of the optical feature
being characterized. However, if a test for AD is to be based on
light scatter profiles, aging effects that could impact ophthalmic
imaging such as yellowing of the lens35 and lens thickness36,37
should be considered. In drug development testing, age-related
increases in lens scatter can most likely be compensated using
age-matched groups in comparative studies. On the other hand,
clinical early detection must work in individuals; young and old
may be at risk for AD. There may be an age-adjusted threshold
that takes into account shifts in optical properties of lens and
other, which would make it possible to determine if there is an
increased risk for AD from retinal light scatter results. Such tests
may need to be repeated. In this case, test intervals would likely
be short compared to time courses of age-related changes.
Our observation that the retinal blood volume is elevated
during disease progression is contrary to reports in the literature
for early AD.15 The following factors are at play: we have
employed ketamine/xylazine as the anesthetic; plausibly, reflex/
feedback vasodilation (localized) could be a contributor. Our
mouse studies are conducted at ages earlier than those that
correspond to ‘‘early AD’’ in humans, implying that retinal blood-
flow may be elevated and then depleted as a function of disease
progression. This second factor could represent early inflamma-
tion response followed by reduced demand for blood flow as
neuronal activity declines. Finally, we also have not directly
measured blood-flow in contrast with the reported study.
Over the past few years, consensus on the molecular
players in AD symptomology has begun to coalesce around Ab-
aggregates of an order between individual strands and plaques.
It has now been shown at a molecular level that soluble Ab-
aggregates such as globulomers and pore-forming hollow rods
interact specifically with neuronal cell-membrane components.
While pore-forming rods compromise membrane integrity,
allowing for general disruption of homeostasis, globulomers
strongly agonize N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. The latter
directly causes psychiatric changes as well as intense oxidative
stress in the cytoplasm that, over time, will lead to neuronal
cell-death. In this respect, we believe that the technique
disclosed in this report is the first to show ability to exploit the
unique optical properties of suspended particles in the size-
range of ~50 to 500 nm (Rayleigh scattering itself and various
magnitudes and directionalities of Mie scattering phenome-
non). This size-range coincides with that of those Ab
aggregation orders that are not just increasingly accepted,
but shown on a molecular level to be some of the pathologic
entities that cause the symptoms as well as underlying the
progressive neuronal damage of AD.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTION
This is the first instance of the detection of early Alzheimer’s
disease in a live Alzheimer’s mouse using hyperspectral
imagery and without the use of an extraneous agent. The
technique described herein is noninvasive. In view of the
possibility that light scattering signals could be used to detect
and monitor early stages of AD in patients, one must consider
eye safety and effects of aging. We were able to measure the
signals in live mice using safe levels of light exposure over tens
of seconds. It is anticipated that similar exposure durations
would be used to examination light scattering changes in
patients. Timely diagnosis of AD is paramount for proper
