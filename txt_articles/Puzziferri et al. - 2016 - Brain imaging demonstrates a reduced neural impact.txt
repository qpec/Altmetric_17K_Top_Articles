Abstract
Objective—We investigated functional brain response differences to food in women with either 
BMI <25kg/m2 (lean) or >35kg/m2 (severe obesity).
Methods—Thirty women 18-65 years old from academic medical centers participated. Baseline 
brain perfusion was measured with arterial spin labeling. Brain activity was measured via blood-
oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in response to food cues, 
and appeal to cues rated. Subjective hunger/fullness was reported pre- and post-imaging. After a 
standard meal, measures were repeated.
Results—When fasting, brain perfusion did not differ significantly between groups; and both 
groups significantly increased activity in the neo- and limbic cortices and midbrain compared to 
baseline (p<0.05, family-wise-error whole-brain corrected). Once fed, the lean group showed 
significantly decreased activation in these areas, especially the limbic cortex, while the group with 
severe obesity showed no such decreases (p<0.05, family-wise-error whole-brain corrected). After 
eating, appeal ratings of food decreased only in lean women. Within groups, hunger decreased 
(p<0.001) and fullness increased (p<0.001) fasted to fed.
Conclusion—While fasting, brain response to food cues in women did not differ significantly 
despite BMI. After eating, brain activity quickly diminished in lean women but remained elevated 
in women with severe obesity. These brain activation findings confirm previous studies.

Introduction
Even if not hungry, seeing food or thinking about food can stimulate eating (see Smeets, 
Erkner and de Graaf(1), and Berthoud(2) for recent and broader discussion). The 
anticipatory or conditioned responses to food cues, rather than hunger, affects us each 
differently depending on gender, energy state, menstrual status, and previous associations to 
those foods or food cues, to name a few(3-5). Those with the insight and/or inhibitory 
control of visual cue urges succeed in maintaining a healthy weight(6). In contrast, 
individuals with obesity are highly vulnerable to external food-related cues(7, 8) and eat 
differently than lean individuals in identical environments (9, 10).
Much current research on eating involves characterizing the role of the brain. Central 
nervous system mechanisms of homeostatic (energy-based) circuits integrate with hedonic 
(reward/motivation-based) circuits to influence eating(11). Given that homeostatic needs are 
easily met, differences in eating for pleasure are likely central to overeating. Physiological 
feedback to our brain upon eating — in the form of changed levels of satiety-related gut 
hormones, adipokines and/or vagal stimuli — mediate and regulate our intake and activation 
of key eating-related brain centers (12-14). In turn, these changes to brain region activation 
further influence behaviors and processes involving eating. If food eaten is pleasurable, its 
intake is reinforced. Interestingly, while taste-based food choices compel women of all body 
mass indices (BMI) to eat, when full, lean women will either stop eating or just sample a 
food they crave rather than eating a large volume as do women with obesity(15).
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used in numerous studies to assess 
differences in regional brain response to visual food cues between individuals with and 
without obesity. A common outcome has been differential activation of brain regions 
mediating reward behaviors. Although space limitations prevent mention of all these 
works, some key findings from this literature follow: In woman with obesity as compared to 
those who are lean, the dorsal striatum, which mediates decision-making related to 
producing reward attainment actions, shows greater activation in the fed state. (16), reward-
system-associated regions—the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, 
orbital frontal cortex (7) and left anterior cingulate(5) — exhibit greater brain activation in 
the fasted state, and when anticipating ingesting (rather than viewing) a basic sweet taste, 
brain response is down-regulated in a fed state(4). In both fasted and fed states, women and 
men with obesity, exhibit significantly greater activity in the medial prefrontal cortex when 
viewing food cues compared to lean individuals (8), which is important because the 
prefrontal cortex mediates motivated behaviors aimed at obtaining a reward. Also, 
individuals with proneness to obesity do not attenuate their neural response after a meal as 
do women and men with obesity resistance(17). Identifying brain circuit activation pattern 
differences between individuals with or without obesity may generate functional biomarkers 
that facilitate the development of obesity treatments. Similarly, identifying brain circuit

 activation differences predicted to occur with bariatric surgery-induced weight loss may 
bring opportunities for developing efficacious non-surgical treatments.
We examined brain responses to visual food cues in women with severe obesity or leanness 
before and after a standard meal. We contrasted alterations in functional brain activation 
within regions that regulate eating behaviors—both homeostatic and hedonic. We 
hypothesized that regions important in mediating reward behaviors (ventral tegmental area, 
nucleus accumbens, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) would be differentially activated by 
viewing food cues in the fasted or fed states, contrasting groups with severe obesity or 
leanness.
Methods
Participants
Fifteen women with severe obesity and 15 age-matched lean women (18-65 years old) were 
recruited through two academic medical centers. The University of Texas Southwestern 
Medical Center and the Veterans Administration North Texas Health Care System 
Institutional Review Boards approved the protocol and all participants gave informed 
consent. Participants with severe obesity were BMI 35-50 kg/m2 and pre-bariatric surgery. 
Lean controls were BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2. Exclusion criteria included untreated Axis I 
psychiatric diagnoses, previous serious head injury, left-handedness, contraindications to 
MRI, prior bariatric surgery, or untreated severe medical illness.
Study Design
Demographic characteristics were collected (Table 1). Psychiatric diagnoses were 
determined using the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual-4 (18). Current depressive symptoms were determined using the 16-item Quick 
Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR16) (19).
Participants arrived at 9 AM in a fasted state (no food after midnight). Subjective hunger or 
fullness (visual analog scale) was rated prior to imaging using a scale from -50 (least 
hunger/fullness ever experienced) to +50 (greatest hunger/fullness ever experienced). 
Participants were then positioned in the MRI scanner with their heads comfortably 
immobilized. Baseline brain perfusion, measured by Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL), was 
acquired prior to fMRI scanning. Participants' brain activities were measured with fMRI 
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response to seeing food cues interleaved with 
directional arrows. An appeal rating (scale of 1-3, not appealing to very appealing) for each 
food shown was recorded. After this imaging session, subjective hunger or fullness was 
rated again. During the next hour, a standard meal of 337 kcals (52% carbohydrate, 30% fat 
and 18% protein) was served. Calories consumed were quantified. The meal consisted of: 
lean beef or chicken, with potato or rice, and green beans; water-packed canned peaches; 
and iced tea +/-splenda or water. After eating, participants again rated hunger or fullness. 
Then participants were re-scanned using an fMRI paradigm identical to the first session 
except with different food cues, avoiding familiarity. Afterward, subjective hunger or 
fullness was rated again.

 fMRI Food Task
Visual food cues (pictures) were similarly sized and presented (Supporting Figure S1). Five 
fMRI BOLD runs per scan session were acquired in an event-related design. In each run, 40 
food pictures were presented for 3 seconds each in a pseudo-randomized sequence over 3.5 
minutes. Null “arrow” events (each 1.5 seconds) were randomly interleaved between the 
food pictures. Ten additional “arrow” events were placed at the run beginning and end to 
establish a baseline BOLD signal. The pictures included 10 high-calorie savory foods, 10 
high-calorie sweet foods, and 20 low-calorie foods. While viewing food pictures, 
participants were asked to rank foods by appeal (“not appealing”, “appealing” or “very 
appealing”) using button press. Details on MRI procedures, and parameters are reported in 
the Supporting Methods.
MRI Data Analysis
Brain images were processed using Statistical Parametric Mapping 5 (20) and fMRI Brain 
Software Library (FSL; Oxford University, UK) (21). fMRI images were realigned to correct 
for motion artifacts; runs with motion exceeding one voxel size were excluded. The 
MPRAGE image was then co-registered to the realigned fMRI images. The Brain Extraction 
Tool (in FSL) was used to extract the brain from the skull and subcutaneous fat in MPRAGE 
images, because excess subcutaneous fat was found to generate distortions in the normalized 
images. Image normalization was done to transform the skull-stripped MPRAGE image into 
Montreal Neurological Institute template space, and the transformation parameters were 
used to normalize the fMRI images. Normalized fMRI images were re-sampled into 2 mm 
cubic voxels and smoothed using an 8mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel to 
minimize inter- participant anatomic variability. Time and dispersion derivatives of the 
hemodynamic response function were included to obtain a better model of the data. A 128 
seconds high-pass filter removed low-frequency noise and slow signal drifts.
Cerebral blood flow (CBF) data were acquired in the “before-meal” session only. CBF 
procedures, parameters and analysis are reported in the Supporting Methods.
fMRI Statistical Analysis
fMRI data were analyzed using a general linear model in which stimulus onsets were 
modeled as events and specified as regressors. These onsets were convolved with the 
hemodynamic response function to account for lag between event onset and the expected 
BOLD signal response. To account for variance from head movement, realignment 
parameters were included as regressors. Flexible factorial design was used for two-group 
(BMI >35kg/m2, BMI <25kg/m2) and two-condition (fasted, fed) analysis. Predicted 
activations were considered significant at p<0.05 after correcting for family-wise-error 
(FWE) across voxels.
Descriptive Statistical Analysis
Continuous demographic and clinical characteristics data were described by means and 
standard deviations and compared by t-test. Categorical variables were described by number 
and proportion of participants, and analyzed by Chi-square or Fisher's exact test. A repeated-
measures analysis of variance was used to assess subjective hunger and fullness with effects

 for within-group (fasted versus fed), between-group (lean versus obese) and a within-group 
by between-group interaction. Appeal ratings of food cues were collapsed to a binary 
outcome (“very appealing/appealing” versus “not appealing”) before analysis. The outcome 
was the proportion of very appealing/appealing responses given for the 200 rated pictures. 
The arc sine transformation was applied to the square root of the proportions to improve the 
normality of the data, and then the repeated measures analysis of variance was applied. SAS 
version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina) was used for all descriptive statistical 
analyses.
Results
Group Characteristics
Thirty women entered and completed the protocol. Of the demographic/clinical 
characteristics and current/lifetime Axis I diagnoses, only weight and BMI differed 
significantly between groups (p=0.001, Table 1). No participants met criteria for current 
depression (QIDS-SR16, all <11).
Eating Behavior
There were no significant differences between groups in standard meal calories consumed 
(BMI <25kg/m2: 301 kcals, (SD 51); BMI >35kg/m2: 302 kcals, (SD 66); p=0.95; table 2). 
Subjective hunger was significantly greater in the fasted versus fed states for both groups 
(p<0.001; see absolute hunger values table 2). The subjective hunger group effect was 
significant (p=0.02), indicating that participants with severe obesity, whether fasted or fed, 
showed quantitatively less hunger than lean controls.
Subjective fullness was significantly lower in the fasted versus fed states for both groups 
(p<0.001; see absolute fullness values table 2). Subjective fullness did not differ 
significantly between groups, at any time point, either before or after eating their standard 
meal (p=0.40, group effect). The groups did not differ significantly in their fullness ratings 
in response to the meal (p=0.45, group × fasted-fed effect), suggesting that each group was 
satiated.
Participants with severe obesity and lean participants differed in how they rated the appeal of 
food cues between the fasted and fed states. The lean group showed a drop of 15% (95% 
Confidence Interval: 5.0 to 24.1) in their rating of appeal as they moved from fasted to fed 
(65% versus 50% rated very appealing/appealing). In contrast, the group with severe obesity 
reported a drop of 4% (95% Confidence Interval: -3.1 to 11.5) (68% versus 64%), which 
indicates sustained appeal of food cues after eating. The fasted/fed-by-group interaction was 
not significant (p=0.070).
Lean Group fMRI outcomes (whole brain, Supporting Figure S2)
In fasted lean participants (Figure 1a), diverse brain regions were activated by food cues. 
Activation of visual/striate cortices was consistent with visual stimuli and the visual cortical 
activations extended to the cerebellum and parietal cortex. Areas within the prefrontal cortex 
(including the anterior cingulate, medial prefrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex)

 were activated, as were regions of the basal ganglia (particularly the caudate nucleus). The 
medial temporal cortex, including the hippocampus and midbrain, in the region associated 
with the ventral tegmental area, was also activated. After eating, activation diminished in the 
anterior cingulate, medial prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, caudate nucleus, 
and midbrain (Figure 1b). The lean [fasted minus fed] analysis (Figure 1c; Table 3) showed 
significant activation reductions after eating (p<0.05, FWE corrected) in the prefrontal 
cortex (anterior cingulate, medial prefrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), basal 
ganglia/caudate nucleus, medial temporal cortex and midbrain regions. Activation in the 
visual cortex and cerebellum were also significantly diminished (p<0.05, FWE corrected), 
while activations in the ventral cortex were sustained.
Group with severe obesity fMRI outcomes (whole brain, Supporting Figure S3)
Fasted participants with severe obesity showed widespread activations by food cues (p<0.05, 
FWE corrected) as did fasted lean participants (Figure 2a). The severe obesity-fasted group 
showed brisk activations in the ventral cortex, with extension into the parietal cortex and 
cerebellum. Prefrontal cortex activations were prominent, including the anterior cingulate, 
medial prefrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, extending to the inferior 
prefrontal cortex and insula. Also prominent were medial temporal cortex activations, 
including the hippocampus, and brainstem regions, including the ventral tegmental area. In 
the fed state, many areas remained significantly activated (p<0.05, FWE corrected), unlike 
the lean group (Figure 2b). The prefrontal, medial temporal, parietal and ventral cortical 
regions all remained active, making the ‘fed’ activations in the obese brain resemble the 
‘fasted’ state. The group with severe obesity [fasted minus fed] analysis showed significantly 
reduced activations [p<0.05, FWE corrected] only in the insula, inferior prefrontal cortex, 
and inferior midbrain; with no significant activation diminution within the prefrontal, medial 
temporal, parietal or ventral cortices (Figure 2c; Table 3).
The lean group deactivated brain regions when fed compared to fasted, in contrast to the 
group with severe obesity (Figure 3; Table 4). Regions in the prefrontal cortex, particularly 
the anterior cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, 
significantly changed going from fasted to fed state in the lean, but not in the group with 
severe obesity. Additionally, in the severe obesity-fasted group, the hypothalamus activation 
did not differ statistically (p=0.07) to the lean-fasted group. Both groups showed no 
meaningful within-group differentiated hypothalamus activation from the fasted to fed 
states.
Baseline Perfusion
To confirm that brain activation findings were not the result of differences between the 
groups in their fasted (baseline) state, we analyzed baseline CBF data. A mask was obtained 
from the regions that showed differences between the groups for the [fasted minus fed] state 
(color voxels, Figure 3) and baseline CBF was obtained for each participant from this mask. 
Baseline CBFs during the fasted state were: lean group = 70.5±9.8 ml/100g/min, group with 
severe obesity = 69.7±9.8 ml/100g/min, demonstrating that the groups were not different in 
the fasted state (p=0.83).

 Discussion
Significant activation of brain regions known to mediate hedonic behaviors occurred in 
fasted participants, both lean and with severe obesity, in response to visual food cues: the 
prefrontal cortex (especially the anterior cingulate), basal ganglia (especially the caudate 
nucleus) and medial temporal cortex, as well as sensory perceptual areas and the parietal 
cortex. The hypothalamus, viewed as a center for body weight homeostasis, showed no 
significant change between groups or across feeding states. After eating, the group with 
severe obesity showed sustained “hungry” activation despite no statistical difference in 
subjective reports of satiation to the lean group who had diminished “non-hungry” 
activation.
These brain activation findings confirm previously shown characteristics for lean or groups 
with obesity studied: without comparators (22, 23), in a different demographic (adolescents, 
males, BMI 25 - 35kg/m2) (24, 25) or in a single state (fasted or fed, but not both) (7, 26, 
27). Few study designs show the clear fed-versus-fasted state differences simultaneously 
between and within groups. Similar to findings by Cornier et al. in obesity-resistant versus 
obesity-prone participants(17), this a priori-designed study demonstrates an ongoing brain 
response to visual food cues in severe obesity—especially in the neo- and limbic cortices, 
and midbrain—after eating a satisfying meal, distinct from lean controls. These findings 
suggest participants with severe obesity fail to engage a brain-wide eating-related process 
associated with satiation. It remains to be clarified whether this brain response to food cues 
is a trait or state response induced by obesity. We are following the participants with severe 
obesity after bariatric surgery to test this outcome.
In this study, key aspects of brain response to eating are reflected by objective behavioral 
response (appeal) and subjective motivation (hunger, fullness)—a translation of brain 
findings to eating behavior. The brain response when fasted is congruent with behavioral and 
motivation experience in both groups; brain activation is high, food pictures are appealing 
and participants are at their hungriest. The brain response when fed remains congruent with 
behavior and motivation experience in lean participants but is divergent in participants with 
severe obesity. Unlike leans, despite diminished hunger/peak fullness, the group with severe 
obesity-fed maintain high brain activation to and appeal ratings of food. Participants with 
severe obesity reported significantly less absolute hunger than lean participants whether 
fasted or fed, but group differences between pre- and post-meal hunger/fullness were 
identical. Taken together, the severe obesity-fed state depicts an ‘uncoupling’ of effective 
brain response to eating and degree of hunger/fullness. These findings may explain why 
participants with severe obesity report an underlying drive to eat continually despite not 
feeling hungry (28), or eat differently, consuming more than lean controls (29, 30).
The lean group decreased regional brain activation to visual food cues after eating, which 
suggests that the brain withdraws attention from food-related stimuli when satiated. The lack 
of diminished brain activation in participants with severe obesity once fed, lends support to 
an appetitive-conditioning psychopathology model (31). Despite satiation, a high brain 
activation pattern identical to fasting in participants with severe obesity reflects a neuronal 
pressure around eating which is absent in lean participants. These brain differences may

 assist clinical weight loss treatment by utilizing brain-based therapies or validating patients' 
feelings of ‘something being wrong’ with regard to eating. Similar to the variability of 
genetically driven weight gain and loss (32, 33), clinicians can acknowledge a disparity in 
response to eating and do so without undermining treatment success.
This study has limitations. The sample size, while sufficient for fMRI data stability, is not 
large per usual clinical study size. Our study meal (337 kcals) was set at the recommended 
lunch caloric level for a 1200 kcal diet(34) and is less than the average 626 kcals meal 
consumed by U.S. women (35); brain activation differences between groups may change 
after a larger meal. While our focus on women is essential as the experience of obesity in 
women differs in many respects from that in men—including heightened perceived physical 
impairments (36), weight-related social stigma and discrimination (37), risk of depression 
(38) and distinct risk factors (39)—our results may not be generalizable to men. Though 
age-matched, with equal numbers of postmenopausal women per group, we could not 
control for menstrual cycles, oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy. Sex 
hormones are known to modulate appetite(40) and may affect these results. Finally, neither 
molecular markers nor gut hormones known to affect brain function were analyzed; such 
correlations are forthcoming. This study's strengths include its use of a longitudinal within- 
and between-group design of absolute and change in brain activation, coupled with behavior 
measures, and post-bariatric surgery follow-up in the obese group. This study contributes to 
the high priority of developing effective obesity targets and treatment strategies.
Conclusion
This study's comparison between lean and participants with severe obesity's brain responses 
to food cues demonstrates how brain activation patterns vary in a fasted versus a fed state. In 
response to food cues, the brains of both lean and participants with severe obesity when 
fasted show fMRI BOLD activation patterns widely distributed in the neo- and limbic 
cortices. Once lean participants are fed, their brain BOLD activations to food pictures are 
broadly reduced. In contrast, after participants with severe obesity are fed, they fail to show 
remarkably altered patterns of brain activation to food cues. In particular, after eating, 
participants with severe obesity maintain activation in the midbrain, one of the most potent 
reward centers. Thus, once satiated after eating, participants with severe obesity continue to 
perceive food as appealing and their brains continue to be activated by visual food cues as 
though they were hungry. Future experiments will determine whether the observed 
participants with severe obesity's brain activation patterns will change following bariatric 
surgery, correlate with changes in body weight-related gut hormones, or differ between high- 
versus low-caloric density visual food cues.

 Study Importance Questions
What is already known about this subject?
•
Differences in brain activity response to food and eating exist between people 
with versus without obesity.
•
Studies showing differences in brain activity response to food, generally focus 
on one state (fasted or fed), and rarely include a group with BMI >35m/kg2 
(severe obesity).
What does our study add?
•
Our study uncovers a critical difference in the brain response to eating between 
women with or without severe obesity. We uniquely establish no significant 
difference in baseline brain perfusion, a surrogate of neural activity, between 
groups at study onset.
•
The difference, a failure in obesity of brain reward center activity to diminish 
after a meal, uniquely augments previous findings by studying brain activity 
across states (fasted and fed), providing within- and between-group 
comparisons, and focusing on women with severe obesity.

 Figure 1. Lean Controls
1a. The group average image from lean controls in a fasted state shows areas of significant 
activation during the imaging task (viewing food cues/pictures), contrasting activation 
during food cues with directional arrows. These regions are significant at p<0.05, family-
wise-error corrected. Illustrative coronal slices show the anterior cingulate (ant cing), 
dorsolateral frontal cortex (dlfc), basal ganglia (caudate and nucleus accumbens) and 
hippocampal regions (hippo) as well as the ventral tegmental area in the midbrain, visual 
cortex and cerebellar regions with extensive activations.
1b. After a meal and when rating themselves as satiated, the lean controls show highly 
attenuated regions of brain activation to food cues compared to directional arrows. The same 
illustrative coronal slices show limited regions of activation in the anterior cingulate, 
dorsolateral frontal, and hippocampal cortex along with the visual cortex, relative to 
directional arrows.
1c. Subtraction of the fed from the fasted group average images in lean controls (Lean, 
fasted-fed) show regions in the lean controls where activations to food cues are greater in the 
fasted state than in the fed state. Illustrative coronal slices show regions in the anterior

 cingulate, dorsolateral frontal, and medial temporal cortex, striatum and nucleus accumbens 
(nuc accum) as well as the ventral tegmental area/midbrain and cerebellum, with 
significantly lower activation in the lean group while viewing food cues after eating than in a 
fasted state. Cluster size and coordinates for all significant clusters are detailed in Table 2 
and dense coronal slices from anterior to posterior brain are shown in Supporting Figure S2.

 Figure 2. Severe Obesity
2a. The group average image from the women with severe obesity in a fasted state shows 
extensive areas of activation during the imaging task (viewing food cues/pictures) when 
contrasting activation during food cues with directional arrows. The regions are significant at 
p<0.05, family-wise-error corrected. The illustrative coronal sections show prominent 
activation in the anterior cingulate, dorsolateral frontal, basal ganglia, and hippocampal 
regions as well as the ventral tegmental area/midbrain, visual cortex and cerebellar regions. 
The fasting activations in the group with severe obesity have the appearance of those in the 
lean fasting scans.
2b. After a meal and when rating themselves as satiated, the women with severe obesity 
show little attenuation of brain activation to food cues in the ‘hedonic’ regions of the brain, 
including the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and ventral tegmental area/midbrain regions 
where lean controls show significant activation attenuation.
2c. Subtraction of the fed from the fasting group with severe obesity average images (severe 
obesity, fasted-fed) show regions in the group with severe obesity where activations to food 
cues are greater in the fasted state than in the fed state. It is merely the insula, periventricular 
regions (perivent) and midbrain regions, which show significantly lower activation in the 
group with severe obesity after eating, and in a satiated state while viewing the food cues.

 Figure 3. Lean-Severe obesity (fasted-fed)
In the [fasted-fed] state × [lean-with severe obesity] group interaction (double subtraction), 
we see the most conservative activation of regions where Lean controls deactivate after 
eating but women with severe obesity maintain activation to the food cues even when no 
longer hungry. Here it is the anterior cingulate and the dorsolateral frontal cortex as well as 
the posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus (prec) and regions in the cerebellum that show 
significant differences. Cluster size and coordinates for all significant regions distinguishing 
fasted/fed states between the Lean/Severe obesity women are detailed in Table 4.
