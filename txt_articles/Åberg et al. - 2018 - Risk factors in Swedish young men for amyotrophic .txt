Abstract
Recent research suggests that the incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may be on the rise. Since ALS becomes 
predominant in later life, most studies on causal factors are conducted in middle-aged or older populations where poten-
tially important influences from early life can usually not be adequately captured. We aimed to investigate predictors in 
young Swedish men for ALS in adulthood. Therefore, we performed a prospective cohort study of young men (aged 16–25, 
n = 1,819,817) who enlisted 1968–2005 and took part in comprehensive conscription examinations. Incident cases of ALS 
(n = 526) during up to 46 years of follow-up were identified in the National Hospital Register and Swedish Cause of Death 
Register. Those who developed ALS had lower BMI (body mass index) at conscription than their peers (p = 0.03). The risk 
of ALS during follow-up was calculated with Cox proportional hazards models. No associations were found with physical 
fitness, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or non-psychotic mental disorders. Low overall muscle strength compared to high 
overall muscle strength [hazard ratio (HR) 1.36; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01–1.83] and low BMI (a one-unit increase 
HR 0.96; 95% CI 0.93–0.99) and lower erythrocyte volume fraction (a one-unit increase HR 0.96; 95% CI 0.92–0.998) were 
the statistically significant predictors for ALS in adjusted models. These findings provide novel epidemiologic evidence of 
a prospective association between low overall muscle strength and erythrocyte volume fraction in young men and ALS risk.

Introduction
Among the rare adult-onset motor neuron diseases, amyo-
trophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common. It is typ-
ically fatal within 2–5 years of symptom onset [1]. However, 
patients with early onset ALS commonly demonstrate a rela-
tively longer survival [2]. The incidence of ALS is largely 
uniform across most parts of the world, but an increasing 
ALS incidence in recent years has been demonstrated both 
internationally [3] and in Sweden [4]. Although recent 
genetic studies have substantially improved our understand-
ing of the causes of ALS, especially familial ALS [5], an 
important role of non-genetic factors in ALS is recognized. 
Elevated risk of ALS has been associated with premorbid 
smoking [6], low body mass index [7, 8], and high level of 
physical fitness [8, 9], whereas intake of antioxidants [10] 
and alcohol [11] seems to be protective. Regarding physical 
activity, the epidemiological evidence of associations with 
ALS is inconsistent [12–15]. One recent prospective cohort

study demonstrated a weak inverse relationship between 
physical activity and ALS [16]. Another showed increased 
risk of ALS with higher physical activity [17]. A previous 
study based on the Swedish conscription register reported 
no association between muscle strength at age 18 and death 
in ALS [9]. However, those results were based on a limited 
number of cases, i.e., 85 ALS deaths and overall muscle 
strength were not studied. Furthermore, there is evidence 
for associations with occupational [18] and environmental 
exposures (reviewed in [19]), as well as different medical 
conditions [20, 21] and increased risk of ALS. Signs of neu-
roinflammation are found in a variety of diseases of the CNS 
including ALS [22], but it is unknown whether systemic 
inflammation precedes the onset of ALS.
A large record linkage study demonstrated a prospective 
association between mental disorders and a first diagnosis 
of ALS within the following year [23]. In that same study, 
a diagnosis of depression was associated with a first record 
of ALS after more than 5 years. The latter finding has raised 
the possibility that the development of depression in middle 
age may be an early marker for neurodegeneration. It has, 
to our knowledge, not been investigated if non-psychotic 
mental disorders occurring earlier in life may be associated 
with future ALS.
Our aim was to investigate potential predictors in young 
adults for ALS in adulthood. We, therefore, performed a 
prospective cohort study of Swedish young men enlisting 
for compulsory military service. These men were followed 
up to 46 years in national registers, resulting in over 500 
ALS cases.
Methods
Population
All Swedes have a unique personal identity number mak-
ing linkage between different registers possible. Using this 
number, data from the Swedish Military Service Conscrip-
tion Register were linked to the Swedish Hospital Discharge 
and death registries. The Swedish Hospital Discharge Reg-
ister includes both inpatient (started 1986 and is complete 
since 1987) and outpatient visits (from 2001). A cohort of 
young individuals aged 16–25 (mean age 18.3, SD 0.7) who 
enlisted for military service between 1968 and 2005 (i.e., 
born between 1950 and 1987) was extracted from the con-
scription register (n = 1,886,542). At that time, all Swedish 
males had to enlist according to Swedish law. Exceptions 
were made regarding those who were imprisoned or had 
severe chronic somatic or mental conditions or functional 
disabilities documented by a medical certificate (approxi-
mately 2–3% annually). Exclusion criteria were: late allo-
cated personal identity number (i.e., personal identity 
number reallocated from deceased person), female sex, 
ALS diagnosis before or at conscription, and missing data 
regarding conscription test center (Fig. 1). To further reduce 
baseline misclassification, we excluded incident ALS cases 
registered within 5 years after conscription (n = 9). The 
remaining 1,819,817 subjects were included in the present 
study (Fig. 1).
Conscription register data
The enlisted men were examined over 2 days by psycholo-
gists and physicians at any of six conscription centers, 
Southern, Western, Eastern, Central (called Bergslagen), 
Northern lower, and Northern upper. The standardized pro-
cedure included measurement of weight and height.

Cardiovascular fitness test
Cardiovascular fitness was evaluated by a cycle ergomet-
ric test. During exercise, the work rate was successively 
increased until limited by exhaustion. The final work rate 
(Wmax) was recorded and divided by body weight. The result-
ing values (Wmax/kg) were converted into stanine scores that 
served as a measure of fitness. There were 394,633 men with 
only estimated values; these were not included in the analy-
ses involving fitness. The test has previously been described 
in detail [9, 24].
Isometric muscle strength
Isometric muscle strength was measured by trained military 
personal according to methods developed by Törnvall [25]. 
Apparatus was calibrated on a daily basis. The strength of 
each muscle group was tested three times [26]. Hand grip 
strength of the strongest hand was measured in Newtons (N) 
in the standing position using a dynamometer devise with 
the upper arm being held vertically with the elbow flexed at 
90°. Strength of right elbow flexion (N) was determined in 
the sitting position with the elbow held at 90° and the fore-
arm held vertically. The strength of the right knee extension 
(N) was measured in the sitting position with the tested leg 
hanging vertically. The dynamometer was fastened at the 
level of the lateral malleolus.
Overall muscle strength
Weighted values for isometric muscle strength were meas-
ured by knee extension (weighted 1.3×), elbow flexion 
(weighted 0.8×), and hand grip (weighted 1.7×) [26]. 
They were integrated into an overall estimate in kilopond 
(until April 1st 1979) or Newton (after April 1st 1979), and 
divided into stanines. Test results were standardized using 
data from the previous years and converted to a 9-point sta-
nine scale (low to high) to assure long-term stability of the 
data sets. These conversions have been performed for over 
30 years by our collaborators at the National Service Admin-
istration in Sweden. We required at least one (of three) 
isometric muscle strength measurement for a conscript to 
get an overall estimate. Some had estimated muscle strength 
values (n = 43,509); these were excluded from the analyses 
involving muscle strength.
Blood samples
Venous samples were taken for analysis of the erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate (ESR) and the erythrocyte volume frac-
tion (EVF, also known as hematocrit). The ESR, an indi-
rect measure of inflammation, is defined as the distance that 
a column of anticoagulated blood falls in 1 h. It reflects a 
systemic response to inflammation, and is related primar-
ily to fibrinogen and immunoglobulin concentrations [27]. 
The EVF is defined as the ratio of the volume occupied by 
red blood cells relative to the volume of whole blood [28]. 
ESR analyses were performed by the Westergren method, 
which is considered the reference method [29]. As the num-
ber of red blood cells influences the ESR, the EVF was used 
as a covariate in the Cox regression model involving ESR. 
The EVF analyses were performed by the microhematocrit 
method and were consistent with the National Committee 
for Clinical Laboratory Standards. ESR and EVF data were 
available for conscription years 1968–1984.
Psychiatric diagnosis
Psychiatric disorders were obtained from the Swedish Mili-
tary Service Conscription Register. During enlistment, a 
psychologist evaluated psychiatric symptoms during a 
structured interview. Enlisted men with such symptoms were 
referred to a physician. First event of non-psychotic psy-
chiatric disorders was diagnosed according to the Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases (ICD). Diagnostic codes for 
depressive disorders, neurotic/adjustment disorders, and per-
sonality disorders before or at conscription (Table 1) were 
pooled together in the model as non-psychotic disorders 
[30]. The distribution with each edition of ICD was 47,175; 
13,085; 5,403 (ICD-8; ICD-9; ICD-10). In that model, indi-
viduals with hospital admissions for psychotic disorders 
including bipolar disorders (ICD codes: 296.1, 296.3, 298.1;

(n = 35,870) to avoid misclassification of conscripts with 
prodromal episodes. In addition, since alcohol intake has 
been suggested protective, those with alcohol-related disor-
ders and other substance use disorders at conscription (ICD 
codes: 291, 294.3, 303, 304; 291, 292, 303, 304, 305.0-8; 
F10–19, n = 9304) were excluded from the Cox model 
involving non-psychotic psychiatric disorders.
Variables from other sources
Parental education
Information on parental education (highest level obtained 
up to year 2009) was taken from the longitudinal integra-
tion database for health insurance and labor market studies 
(Swedish acronym LISA, 80% coverage). For the purpose 
of this study, parental education (maternal and paternal 
education treated separately) was trichotomized as pre-high 
school (up to 9 years)/high school and < 2 years at univer-
sity/≥ 2 years at university and postgraduate.
Outcomes
Data sources
The universal healthcare system in Sweden offers low-cost 
outpatient and hospital care to all citizens. Swedish Hospital 
Discharge Register coverage gradually increased during the 
period 1968–1986, and is complete since 1987. Each patient 
is given a principal diagnosis and up to 30 secondary diag-
noses at discharge. Diagnoses in hospital outpatient care are 
recorded from 2001. Deaths were identified by linkage with 
the Swedish Cause of Death Register, which is maintained 
at the National Board of Health and Welfare. This register 
is updated annually based on death certificate diagnoses and 
covers virtually all deaths since 1961.
ALS diagnoses
Cases were men who had a first time diagnosis of ALS (ICD 
8 code 348.00, 348.10, and 348.21, ICD 9 code 335.2 and 
ICD 10 code G12.2) in the National Hospital Discharge Reg-
ister or on their death certificate.
Statistical analysis
The statistical calculations were performed with SAS ver-
sion 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The follow-up 
period started at the date of conscription (baseline) and 
subjects were followed until the time of: (1) first ALS hos-
pitalization or hospital-based outpatient clinic contact, (2) 
death, (3) emigration, or (4) the end of follow-up, Decem-
ber 31, 2014 (minimum 9 years, maximum 46 years). For 
comparison of the population characteristics among men 
with and without ALS during follow-up, binary logistic 
regression was used for non-psychotic psychiatric diag-
noses, multinomial logistic regression for conscription 
test center, ordinal logistic regression for ordered catego-
ries, and linear regression for continuous variables. Tests 
based on scaled Schoenfeld residuals were used to assess 
the proportional hazards assumption [31]. No significant 
violation was found for any of the variables in any of the 
models. Thus, there was no evidence for time-dependent 
associations, and Cox proportional hazards models were 
used to assess the influence of presumptive predictors and 
potential confounders for an ALS diagnosis.
The following presumptive independent predictors for 
ALS were treated as continuous variables: body mass 
index, Wmax, hand grip, elbow flexion, knee extension, 
ESR, and EVF. We examined deviations from linearity 
with restricted cubic splines, and found no significant 
deviations and no improvement in Akaike Information Cri-
terion. Categorical variables were conscription test center, 
cardiovascular fitness, overall muscle strength, parental 
education, and non-psychotic psychiatric disorders. Car-
diovascular fitness, overall muscle strength, and parental 
education were trichotomized as low, medium, and high. 
As temporal differences, as well as procedural differences 
among sites could result in bias, conscription year and 
test center were considered potential confounders and 
adjusted for in all regression models. Furthermore, age at 
conscription was adjusted for. Because of the large number 
of observations, the risk for type I errors is considered low.
For the exposure variables, overall muscle strength and 
cardiovascular fitness, respectively, which both had more 
than 10% missing values and over 5% difference between 
the proportions of missing values among ALS cases com-
pared to non-cases, we performed analyses using multiple 
imputations by the fully conditional specification approach 
[32], using 20 imputations and 22 iterations. All variables 
included in any of the other analyses were included in 
the imputation model, with the exception of variables that 
were functions or transformations of other variables, such 
as grip strength per kg, where only the original variable 
was included. In addition, we included height, weight, 
blood pressure, resting heart rate, stress resilience, IQ 
and command suitability evaluated at the conscription and 
indicators for diabetes, death and emigration, and the esti-
mated cumulative baseline hazard and event indicator for 
ALS as recommended in [33]. Convergence was assessed 
using plots of the mean and standard deviation and found 
satisfactory.

The Ethics Committee of the University of Gothenburg 
and Confidentiality Clearance at Statistics Sweden approved 
the study. Requirement for informed consent was waived 
for the current study, because it was a secondary analysis of 
existing data. The investigation conforms to the principles 
outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Results
Of the 1,819,817 conscripts in the present study, 526 (ICD-
8, n = 10, ICD-9, n = 26 and ICD-10, n = 490) were diag-
nosed with ALS during up to 46 years of follow-up (Fig. 1). 
We used several registers for the analyses: hospital register, 
hospital outpatients register, and Cause of Death Register, 
which could be considered complete since 1987, 2001, and 
1961, respectively. Almost all (n = 514) were identified 
by the Hospital Register. The cases ascertained from each 
source were: inpatient hospital only (n = 27), outpatient 
hospital only (n = 123), death only (n = 12), both inpatient 
and outpatient hospital (n = 98), both inpatient hospital and 
death (n = 45), both outpatient hospital and death (n = 13), 
all three sources (n = 208). The median age at first hospi-
tal inpatient/outpatient contact with an ALS diagnosis was 
50.0 years. Many of the cases were identified by the hospi-
tal register at the very end of our observation period (e.g., 
2010–2014); inpatient hospital (n = 52), outpatient hospital 
(n = 187), and both sources (n = 239), and 248 of all 514 
(48%) identified by the Hospital Register were still alive in 
2014. Half of the 12 deaths identified solely by the Cause of 
Death Register occurred prior to 2001, i.e., before outpatient 
data were included in the hospital register. The median age 
at death for cases captured solely in the Cause of Death Reg-
ister was 43.5 years compared to 49.2 years for all deceased 
cases and 51.3 years for deceased cases only captured in the 
outpatient (but not inpatient) hospital register.
Table 2 shows baseline data for men with and without 
ALS diagnosis during follow-up. Numbers of missing 
values for non-cases/ALS cases were as follows (p values 
adjusted for calendar year): for BMI 150,882 (8.3%)/26 
(4.9%) (p = 0.002), parental education 62,222 (3.5%)/37 
(7.0%) (p = 0.72), overall muscle strength 201 084 (11%)/25 
(4.8%) (p = 0.002), cardiovascular fitness 585,566 (32%)/97 
(18.4%) (p = 0.47), ESR 57,089 (7.5%)/17 (3.8%) (p = 0.35), 
and EVF 59,447 (7.8%)/23 (5.2%) (p = 0.98). To investigate 
the impact of missing values on the results, we performed 
multiple imputation and reanalyzed overall muscle strength 
and cardiovascular fitness (see below). An association was 
seen with recruitment region. Baseline BMI was signifi-
cantly lower in the ALS group. There was also a tendency 
towards a difference in overall muscle strength (p = 0.06), as 
shown by a smaller proportion of ALS subjects in the high 
muscle strength group. A tendency for lower erythrocyte 
volume fraction in the ALS group (p = 0.05) was also noted.
We evaluated conscription region, BMI, parental educa-
tion, overall muscle strength (including each separate sub-
parameter: grip strength, biceps strength, and knee exten-
sion), cardiovascular fitness, erythrocyte sedimentation 
rate, erythrocyte volume fraction, and mental disorder in 
the relation to the risk of developing ALS (Table 3). BMI, 
erythrocyte volume fraction, and overall muscle strength 
were the variables prospectively associated with ALS in 
analyses adjusted for age, conscription year, and conscrip-
tion test center. A one-unit increase in BMI or erythrocyte 
volume fraction was associated with lower ALS risk. Low 
muscle strength at conscription was associated with a 1.4-
fold increase for ALS later in life, compared to high muscle 
strength. Sensitivity analyses in which we repeated the anal-
ysis for muscle strength also including men with estimated 
scores yielded similar findings. Performing subanalyses for 
each muscle strength stanine score revealed that a significant 
risk increase was found for stanine 1 only, with unadjusted 
HR 4.3 (1.03–17.8) comparing stanine 1 with 9 (no differ-
ences were found for stanines 2–8, data not shown). The 
analysis using the imputed dataset showed adjusted HR 1.32 
(0.98–1.77) for low muscle strength and adjusted HR 1.14 
(0.91–1.41) for medium muscle strength (both compared to 
high overall muscle strength).
There was also an increased risk of ALS in the upper 
north recruitment region compared to the other regions 
(shown in Table 3 as a decreased risk of ALS in all other 
regions when the upper north region was reference cate-
gory). We found no prospective relationship between car-
diovascular fitness and ALS. The analysis using the imputed 
data set yielded similar associations with adjusted HR 1.12 
(0.85–1.49) for low fitness and adjusted HR 1.07 (0.86–1.33) 
for medium fitness (both compared to high cardiovascular 
fitness).
A sensitivity analysis in which men with estimated 
Wmax scores were included yielded similar findings (data 
not shown). Additional adjusting for BMI did not affect the 
results.
Non-psychotic mental disorders were not associated with 
ALS. A separate analysis of the association between alcohol/
drug disorders (n = 9,304) was not meaningful due to lack 
of statistical power (only 2 ALS cases).
Discussion
Low muscle strength, low BMI, and lower erythrocyte vol-
ume fraction in young men were associated with increased 
risk of ALS in this large male cohort. We did not find sup-
port for the previously reported association with physical 
fitness at conscription. No associations were found with

parental education, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or psy-
chiatric disorders.
Possible mechanisms
To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a 
prospective relationship with low overall muscle strength 
measured decades prior to a clinical diagnosis of ALS. It 
has recently been shown that respiratory muscle strength 
is a strong predictor for survival in ALS [34]. In line with 
Mattsson et al. [9], we found no association between each 
separate subparameter of muscle strength, i.e., grip strength, 
biceps strength, and knee extension and later ALS. As in the 
previous studies [7, 9], we found that low BMI was associ-
ated with future ALS. These findings suggest that the previ-
ously reported association between BMI and future ALS 
may actually reflect early muscular parameters.
It has been suggested that there is a risk phenotype for 
ALS characterized by relatively more type 1 muscle fib-
ers (slow twitch fibers) [9]. Type 1 muscle fibers are the

predominant muscle fiber type in endurance sports which 
may explain the higher incidence of ALS among profes-
sional athletes [19, 35]. The premorbid overall lower mus-
cle strength seen in the present study could, perhaps, be 
explained by a smaller proportion of the larger type 2b fib-
ers and in particular to the lesser force generating capac-
ity of type 1 compared with type 2b fibers [36]. Muscle 
biopsies demonstrated that type 1 fibers are affected earlier 
and more severely in ALS [37]. There are so far no data on 
premorbid muscle fiber pathology in ALS.
Other plausible premorbid mechanisms may be motor 
nerve hyperexcitability [38], androgen insensitivity [39, 
40], and inflammation [41, 42]. In the current study, we 
did not find evidence of an association between a systemic 
marker of inflammation (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and 
future ALS. However, a significant association was observed 
for erythrocyte volume fraction (EVF), i.e., each percent 
increase was associated with a 4% decreased risk of later 
ALS. Although changes in EVF could predict disease pro-
gression in patients diagnosed with ALS [43], there are, to 
our knowledge, no previous reports indicating lower EVF 
as an early predictor of ALS. The present observation thus 
needs further investigation and it is far too early to speculate 
in mechanisms such as motor neuron and skeletal muscle 
oxygenation.
Somewhat surprisingly, the previously reported prospec-
tive association with high level of physical fitness in Swed-
ish conscripts [8, 9] was not confirmed in our larger cohort. 
In addition to sample size, some other differences may help 
to explain the divergent results. The previous Swedish con-
scription study by Mattsson et al. only studied men born 
between 1951 and 1965 (based on deaths only, n = 85 cases), 
whereas we studied men born between 1950 and 1987 which 
means that the differences could be due to temporal trends. 
In our study, 42% of the ALS cases were still alive [9]. In 
addition, a recent Swedish conscription study by Longinetti 
et al. [8] showed that individuals with physical fitness above 
the highest tertile tended to have a higher risk of ALS before 
the age of 45 years, statistically significant associations only 
at age 41–43 years at ALS onset and only after adjustment 
for BMI and resting heart rate. Our cohort size is similar to 
that of the Longinetti et al. study, but our longer follow-up 
time yielded 87 additional ALS cases. The study of Longi-
netti et al. compares conscripts with high physical fitness 
(Wmax/kg: ≥ 4.25 W/kg) with conscripts with lower physical 
fitness in fitted flexible parametric models with attained age 
as the time scale. We found no evidence for time-dependent 
associations for cardiovascular fitness or Wmax/kg in any of 
the models.
As expected due to the higher incidence of ALS in the 
background population [44], men who enlisted in Northern 
Sweden were more likely to develop ALS than their peers 
who enlisted at other sites. The most plausible explanation 
for this is a genetic vulnerability. Familial aggregation and 
genetic risk factors have been estimated to explain 10–15% 
of all ALS cases [45]. One of the two major genetic con-
tributions to ALS known to date is the C9ORF72 gene at 
chromosome 9 which is overrepresented in Northern Swe-
den [19]. In addition, persons living in northern Sweden 
might be differentially exposed to (unknown) environmental 
factors.
We could not detect any associations between non-
psychotic mental disorder at conscription and later ALS.

The previously demonstrated association with psychiatric 
disorders occurring more proximate in time [23] might 
suggest that mental disorders are prodromal symptoms of 
ALS-related neurodegeneration rather than predictors or risk 
factors per se.
Strengths and limitations
Strengths of this study include the large sample size (> 1.8 
million participants) and the prospective population-based 
design. The study population is largely representative of the 
male general population as only a small proportion (approxi-
mately 2–3% annually) of Swedish men were exempted from 
conscription prior to 2005. The follow-up was long, allowing 
for a considerably larger number of ALS cases compared to 
the previous studies employing the conscription register. The 
Swedish Hospital Discharge Register has a high accuracy for 
chronic diseases [46]. Both the Hospital Discharge Register 
[47] and the Swedish Cause of Death Register [9] have been 
shown to provide accurate ALS data.
The data retrieval of non-psychotic disorders from con-
scription data is a strength of the present study including 
psychologists and medical doctors for baseline measure 
of mental health at conscription. The general incidence is 
likely to be underestimated for non-psychotic disorders in 
the Hospital Discharge Register, since these disorders are 
mostly seen in primary care (where no national registers 
are available). This is less of a concern for estimates for 
psychotic disorders (diagnostic codes used for exclusion 
only to avoid misclassification of conscripts with prodro-
mal episodes), as most persons with these disorders will 
come to the attention of psychiatric services at some point in 
time. However, psychotic disorders could be underestimated 
in this study, because outpatient hospital data, which are 
likely more sensitive than inpatient data, are only available 
for 2001–2014. We believe that it is unlikely that the asso-
ciations we examined would be particularly sensitive to this 
lack of information which should be similar for individuals 
with and without an ALS diagnosis. Psychiatric diagnosis 
codes may change over time with each edition of ICD. The 
diagnostic validity of the schizophrenic disorders in the 
Swedish National Hospital Discharge Register has been 
shown to be high [48]. While not all mental diagnoses have 
been individually validated, the positive predictive values 
for most ICD diagnoses in the Swedish National Hospital 
Discharge Register are reported to be 85–95% [46].
There are further limitations to our study. For some expo-
sure variables, for example, overall muscle strength and car-
diovascular fitness, the amount of missing values could have 
biased the results. However, adjusting for the impact of miss-
ing values with multiple imputations showed similar asso-
ciations, although it did not reach statistical significance for 
low muscle strength. The study population is homogeneous, 
with a majority of Caucasian males at the age of 18, which 
confines the generalizability to other populations, and to 
women. A draw back of the present study is that ALS cases 
may be under ascertained, since outpatient hospital data, 
which are likely more sensitive than inpatient data, are only 
available for 2001–2014. Before 1987, a case had to be diag-
nosed with ALS, die from it, and have ALS recorded on their 
death certificate to appear in the Cause of Death Register. 
There is a lag between diagnosis and death (probably 5–10% 
of ALS patients survive more than 10 years after diagnosis), 
so we may not have captured all ALS cases. In addition, a 
median age of 50.0 years for ALS cases is a little bit younger 
than what has typically been reported (i.e., 55 or 60 years) 
[1]. There are two likely explanations for this. First, men 
who signed for military service in the recent years were not 
old enough to develop ALS at the end of the observation 
period, and second, it has been shown that women have a 
later onset-age compared to men [49]. A median age at death 
of 43.5 years regarding the 12 cases captured solely in Cause 
of Death Register is about 20 years younger than what has 
typically been reported which was probably due to a selec-
tion of individuals with an early onset ALS. The median age 
at death was higher when all cases that died were included.
Our study design did not allow for the examination of 
youth metabolic factors that may be of importance for BMI 
and the development of ALS. Obesity and type 2 diabetes 
(not type 1) have been shown protective for ALS [21, 50]. 
Recent research shows that alterations in the carbohydrate, 
lipid, and apolipoprotein metabolisms are associated with 
ALS risk [51]. High glucose level was associated with a 
lower incidence, whereas high LDL-C/HDL-C and high 
apoB/apoA-I ratios were associated with a higher ALS 
incidence. Higher levels of LDL and apoB might affect the 
energy supply to the nervous system. Increased apoB has 
been associated with inflammation and oxidative stress—a 
common disease mechanism of ALS [52]. In addition, we 
were not able to study the development of certain exposures 
that may affect the risk of ALS such as smoking habits, diet, 
physical activity, exposure to toxins, and occupation during 
follow-up.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we found that low overall muscle strength in 
young men was associated with increased risk of ALS. The 
previously reported prospective association with low BMI 
could in part be a reflection of low overall muscle mass. 
Additional explanations may include obesity, diabetes, and 
unhealthy lipid profiles. Our study provides an interesting 
lead for further ALS research to determine whether a pre-
morbid neuromuscular constitution or pathogenesis may 
exist already in young adults.
