groups. The vitamin D status decreased in similar propor-
tions between groups, whereas salivary IgA decreased in 
the SL group only (P < 0.05, d = 0.23). The incidence of 
URTI was not altered in both groups. All participants in both 
groups went to bed earlier during the training program (SL 
−20 min, CON −27 min, P < 0.05, d = 0.28). In the SL 
group, only sleep efficiency slightly decreased by 1.1 % 
(P < 0.05, d = 0.25) and the fragmentation index tended to 
increase at the end of the protocol (P = 0.06).
Conclusion Sleeping and training the next morning regu-
larly with reduced glycogen availability has minimal 
effects on selected markers of immunity, the incidence of 
URTI and sleeping patterns in trained athletes.

Abstract 
Purpose We investigated the effects of a 3-week dietary 
periodization on immunity and sleep in triathletes.
Methods 21 triathletes were divided into two groups with 
different nutritional guidelines during a 3-week endurance 
training program including nine twice a day sessions with 
lowered (SL group) or maintained (CON group) glycogen 
availability during the overnight recovery period. In addi-
tion to performance tests, sleep was monitored every night. 
Systemic and mucosal immune parameters as well as the 
incidence of URTI were monitored every week of the train-
ing/nutrition protocol. Two-ways ANOVA and effect sizes 
were used to examine differences in dependent variables 
between groups at each time point.
Results The SL group significantly improved 10 km running 
performance (−1 min 13 s, P < 0.01, d = 0.38), whereas no 
improvement was recorded in the CON group (−2 s, NS). 
No significant changes in white blood cells counts, plasma 
cortisol and IL-6 were recorded over the protocol in both

Introduction
Training strategies with low glycogen availability are 
increasingly used by endurance athletes in an attempt to 
improve performance thus also increasing scientific inter-
est for exercise physiologists (Bartlett et al. 2015). The 
main expected effect of “training low” is to enhance train-
ing stress and thus physiological adaptations related to 
endurance performance. Several studies have reported an 
enhanced expression of a number of genes related to the 
stress response, substrate utilization, and mitochondrial 
biogenesis in athletes experiencing training low strategies 
compared to training with normal glycogen availability 
(Bartlett et al. 2015; Impey et al. 2016). Several “training 
low” strategies are used by endurance athletes such as train-
ing in a fasted state (i.e., 6–10 h after the last meal), train-
ing twice per day (where the second session is performed 
with reduced glycogen stores), or restricting carbohydrates 
(CHO) intake during the recovery period after exercise 
(Hansen et al. 2005; Morton et al. 2009; Van Proeyen et al. 
2011; Yeo et al. 2008). Recently, the “sleeping low” strat-
egy has been introduced, consisting of training in the even-
ing followed by overnight fast and performing a subsequent 
training session in the morning, to accentuate the glycogen 
deprivation without altering exercise intensity (Lane et al. 
2015; Marquet et al. 2016). Taken together, results from the 
literature suggest that the most stressful training situation 
may provide the greatest physiological adaptation. How-
ever, it is well known that increasing training stress could 
influence immune function and increase the risk of illness 
and/or injury limiting improvements in performance (Glee-
son 2007).
In endurance sports, training load, nutrient intake and 
sleep are key factors modulating immune function either 
positively or negatively (Gleeson 2007; Nieman 2000). 
Regular physical activity, as well as balanced diet and 
enough sleep are associated with improved immune func-
tion (Fullagar et al. 2015; Nieman 1998). On the contrary, 
prolonged or strenuous exercise, energetic deficit and a 
lack of sleep, decrease immune function and increase sus-
ceptibility to infections and pathologies. Several studies 
have reported an increased prevalence of upper respira-
tory tract infections (URTI) during overload training pro-
grams and after endurance events such as marathon races 
(Bermon 2007; Pyne et al. 1995). For example, Nieman 
et al. (1990) recorded that 13 % of participants reported 
URTI during the week following the Los Angeles Mara-
thon race and 40 % reported at least one episode of URTI 
during the 2 months prior to the race. Many components of 
the immune system exhibit changes after endurance exer-
cise (Hoffman-Goetz and Pedersen 1994). This alteration 
in immune function reaches its summit within a window of 
3–72 h after exercise reflecting the physiological stress the 
endurance athlete’s body is experiencing (Gleeson 2007). 
During this “open window” phenomenon, the body’s abil-
ity to fight infections is dramatically lowered, typically 
associated with changes in leukocyte counts and produc-
tion of interleukins and immunoglobulins (Gleeson 2007). 
A reduction in carbohydrate availability during exercise 
may accentuate the alteration of immune function. Several 
authors have shown that very low CHO diets (<10 % of 
energy intake from CHO) induce an alteration of immune 
response compared to normal or high CHO diets (Bishop 
et al. 2001a; Mitchell et al. 1998). Although normal or high 
CHO availability during endurance exercise is effective in 
attenuating some immune perturbations, there is still no 
evidence that these beneficial effects on immune param-
eters are clinically relevant.
In addition to adapted dietary intake, optimized sleep 
patterns constitute a prerequisite for a good assimilation of 
training load (Myllymaki et al. 2011; Samuels 2008). Suf-
ficient sleep participates greatly in the maintenance of the 
body homeostasis necessary to endure training sessions 
apart from injuries and infections. More than the sleep 
duration, the rhythmic cycle of sleep and wakefulness have 
important implications on the regulation of several hor-
mones involved in the management of fatigue and immune 
function (Shepard and Shek 1996). Although regular exer-
cise has been shown to improve sleep quality, the latter can 
be affected during intense training periods (Hausswirth 
et al. 2014; Leeder et al. 2012; Taylor et al. 1997). A sig-
nificant reduction in sleep duration (−6 %), sleep effi-
ciency (−2 %) and time in bed (−3 %), and an increase 
in wakefulness after sleep onset (+3 %), were recorded in 
classical ballet dancers at the end of 67 days of high physi-
cal training before a premiere performance (Fietze et al. 
2009). Similarly, Hausswirth et al. (2014) reported a signif-
icant decrease in sleep duration (−7.9 %), sleep efficiency 
(−1.6 %) and immobile time (−7.6 %) after 3 weeks of 
overload training in triathletes. These sleep disturbances 
were associated with a higher prevalence of URTI (+67 %) 
compared with a control group without increase in train-
ing load. Additionally, some studies suggest that nutritional 
feedings may alter the sleep quality (Halson 2014). Con-
suming CHO in a solid meal could reduce sleep latency, 
while diets rich in protein may result in enhanced sleep 
quality by limiting wake episodes (Afaghi et al. 2008; 
Lindseth et al. 2013). There is limited research in this area 
and additional studies are necessary to evaluate the influ-
ence of habitual diet on sleep patterns, and the combined 
effects of strenuous exercise and nutritional manipulation.
The aim of this study was to assess whether the sleep low 
strategy, consisting of sleeping with reduced glycogen avail-
ability might alter sleep patterns (i.e., sleep quantity and qual-
ity) and immune response in trained triathletes. Using the 
same experimental protocol, this study is a complement to that

presented by Marquet et al. (2016) giving us the opportunity to 
provide new insight on the potential side effects of the promis-
ing sleep low strategy. In light of past literature, we hypoth-
esized that when sleeping low, athletes would experience an 
alteration of immune function accompanied with a higher 
prevalence of URTI, as well as disturbances in sleep patterns.
Methods
Participants
Twenty-one trained male triathletes volunteered to partici-
pate in this study. Subjects could be included if they were 
currently healthy, aged 18–40 years, had been involved in 
endurance training and competition for at least 2 years, 
and trained at least 10 h per week including several moder-
ate to high intensity training sessions per week. Their mean 
(±SD) age, height, body mass, maximal oxygen uptake, and 
maximal aerobic power were 31 ± 4.7 years, 1.79 ± 0.05 m, 
71.6 ± 4.5 kg, 4.2 ± 0.4 L.min−1, 336.6 ± 31.4 W. Before 
the experiment a cardiologist examined all the participants 
to check they did not present contraindications to physical 
exercise and to ensure normal electrocardiograph patterns. 
All subjects were free of URTI symptoms for at least 2 weeks 
and had not taken any medication in the 4 weeks prior to the 
study. The experimental design of the study was approved by 
the local Ethics Committee (Paris IDF VI, France) and was 
carried out according to the Declaration of Helsinki. After 
comprehensive verbal and written explanations of the study, 
all subjects gave their written informed consent to participate.
Study design
An overview of the study design is shown in Fig. 1. This 
study was conducted to analyze the potential effects of 
chronic reduced glycogen availability during and between 
endurance training sessions on sleep pattern, selected 
immune parameters and the incidence of URTI. 21 trained 
triathletes were randomly assigned to two different groups 
undertaking the same endurance training program for three 
consecutive weeks with different nutritional guidelines. 
Although one group was instructed to reduce its CHO 
intake during and between training sessions according to a 
sleep low design (named Sleep Low group, SL group), the 
other group maintained regular CHO intake over the day 
(named Control group, CON group) so that the SL group 
slept with low glycogen availability while the other group 
slept with normal CHO availability. In addition to perfor-
mance tests in running, sleep patterns, immune parameters 
and the incidence of URTI were regularly assessed before, 
during and after the training program.
Training protocol
After preliminary testing sessions, all participants were 
involved in a 6-week training program, which was divided 
into two distinct phases interspersed with testing sessions. 
The first phase (I) consisted of 3 weeks during which the 
participants completed their usual training regime (10–15 h 
per week at various intensities). This first training period 
was organized to ensure that all participants were regularly 
involved in an endurance training and in a similar training 
status before the beginning of the study. The second phase 
(II) consisted of 3 weeks during which all participants com-
pleted the same standardized training program with differ-
ent nutritional guidelines. The training program consisted 
of six training sessions over four consecutive days, includ-
ing high intensity training (HIT) sessions in the afternoon 
(after 5 pm) and low intensity training (LIT) sessions in 
the next morning (before 10 am). The training intensity 
was individually set according to the individual maximal

tation of the experimental

aerobic power (MAP). All LIT sessions consisted of 60 min 
cycling at 65 % MAP, while HIT sessions consisted alter-
natively of 8x5 min cycling at 85 % MAP and 6x5 min 
running at individual 10 km intensity with 1 min recovery 
between sets. One LIT session per day was prescribed for 
the other days of the week to maintain a 10–15 h training 
volume. All participants performed all the training sessions 
in their own training structure and were monitored (activ-
ity, duration, intensity, rate of perceived exertion) and con-
trolled by heart rate recordings.
Nutritional protocol
Before phase II, participants were randomly assigned to 
either the CON group (n = 10) or the SL group (n = 11) 
and had to follow different nutritional guidelines according 
to their group. In the SL group, no CHO intake was allowed 
for all HIT and LIT sessions. The dinner was also CHO-
free and the LIT sessions were performed after an over-
night fast so that they trained with low glycogen availabil-
ity. On the contrary, the glycogen availability was regularly 
maintained in the CON group by consuming a sports drink 
(4.5 % CHO, Gatorade Performance Series®, Pepsico, 
USA) during training sessions and CHO at every meal. 
Finally all groups ingested the same amount of CHO per 
day (~6 g.kg−1.day−1) but allocated differently over each 
day. A typical daily CHO periodization for both groups 
during training days in phase II is depicted in Fig. 2. All 
participants received standardized dietary recommendation 
according to their membership group and their body 
weight. To avoid muscle catabolism, a high protein sugar-
free drink (High Protein 15 g, 20 mL, UHS Bruno, France) 
was prescribed just before going to bed.
The participants had to fill in a food diary during the last 
week in phase I and phase II. They were instructed to fill in 
it the most detailed as possible (weighed food, pictures of 
dishes, details of the use of cooking fat, type and quantity 
of oil used for dressing…). The diaries were analyzed by 
the same scientist with the software Nutrilog 2.31 (Nutrilog 
SAS, France).
Measurements
˙
VO2max and performance tests
For their first visit to the lab, subjects underwent an incre-
mental cycling test at a self-selected cadence on an elec-
tronically braked cycle ergometer (Excalibur Sport, Lode®, 
Groningen, The Netherlands). The test consisted of a 
warm-up lasting 6 min at 100 W followed by an incremen-
tal period in which power output was increased by 25 W 
every 2 min until volitional exhaustion. The test was per-
formed until exhaustion to assess maximal oxygen uptake 
(˙
VO2max) and maximal aerobic power (MAP). During the 
test, oxygen uptake (˙
VO2), carbon dioxide uptake (˙
VCO2 
), 
minute ventilation (˙
VE) and respiratory exchanges ratio 
(RER) were continuously recorded and monitored as 
breath by breath values (Quark, Cosmed®, Rome, Italy). 
Fig. 2  Daily CHO periodization for SL and CON groups during training days in phase II. CHO intake was distributed at every meal, snack and 
training sessions in the CON group, whereas it was concentrated only from breakfast (~8:15) to afternoon snack (~16:00) in the SL group

The gas and flow analyzers were calibrated prior to each 
test using ambient air, known-concentration gas and a 3 L 
syringe. ˙
VO2max was determined by the highest 30 s aver-
age value. MAP (W) was calculated as MAP = W com-
pleted + 25 × (t/120) where W is the last completed work-
load and t is the number of seconds in the last workload 
completed or not.
The performance test was the same presented in the 
recent study published by Marquet et al. (2016). Briefly 
it was organized to assess the potential changes in endur-
ance performance in ecological condition. It was planned 
during the first week as a familiarization trial, and immedi-
ately before and after the Phase II. This test was designed 
to simulate the end of a triathlon race. The test started by 
40 min cycling at 70 % MAP at a self-selected cadence, 
immediately followed by a 10 km simulated running race. 
To allow the subject to drink during the exercise, two short 
active rest periods (30 s at 100 W at minutes 15 and 30) 
were organized, during which a water bottle was given to 
the subject. Immediately after the cycling exercise, the sub-
jects quickly moved to the running track (340 m indoor) to 
start a 10 km test. During this test, subjects did not wear 
any apparatus and could drink a CHO-rich drink (4.5 g 
CHO per liter, Gatorade Performance Series-Endurance 
Formula) whenever they wanted. The bottle was placed on 
a table positioned on the running track. The bottle was reg-
ularly replaced on the table after each drink and weighed 
before and after the running test to evaluate the fluid intake. 
No significant difference was observed for the quantity 
of CHO ingested between performance tests (P = 0.62) 
and between groups (respectively for SL group; PRE vs. 
POST 14.7 ± 7.21 vs. 15.3 ± 6.43 g; P = 0.47 and for 
CON group PRE vs. POST 18.0 ± 15.5 vs. 15.1 ± 11.3 g; 
P = 0.50) The time lap was continuously recorded by an 
experimenter positioned on the track.
Blood collection and analyses
To avoid interassay variation, all blood samples were ana-
lyzed in a single batch at the end of the study. In five occa-
sions (before and after the phase II, and before the last 
training session each week of the phase II, day 4, 11 and 
18) in a fasted state, blood samples were collected from a 
superficial forearm vein using standard venipuncture tech-
niques. 33 mL of blood was directly collected into EDTA 
tubes (2 EDTA tubes = 6 mL and 1 EDTA tube = 3 mL) 
for each sample (Greiner Bio-one; Frickenhausen, 
Germany).
Blood samples were immediately centrifuged at 
4000 rev min−1 for 10 min at +4 °C to separate plasma 
from red blood cells. The obtained plasma sample was 
then stored in multiple aliquots (Eppendorf type, 1500 μL 
per sample) at −80 °C until analysis. From these samples, 
cortisol and vitamin D concentrations were determined in 
plasma with commercially available high sensitivity ELISA 
kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The assay 
for [cortisol]b had an intraassay CV of 9.2–6.3 % over a 
concentration range of 1.3–6.5 µg L−1 and an interassay 
CV of 21.2–10.4 % over 1.1–5.5 µg L−1. The assay for 
[vitamin D]b had an intraassay CV of 5.7–6.2 % over a 
concentration range of 33–180 ng mL−1 and an interassay 
CV of 5.1–7.4 % over 52.9–164 ng mL−1. All blood sam-
ples were analyzed in duplicate at respective wavelength on 
a spectrophotometer Dynex MRXe (Magellan Biosciences, 
Chelmsford, MA, USA). Blood from 3 mL tubes was ana-
lyzed for leukocyte count using an automated cell counter 
(Cell-DynH RubyTM, Abbott, IL, USA) and standard labo-
ratory procedures.
Saliva collection and analyses
On five occasions (before and after the phase II, and before 
the last training session each week of the phase II, day 4, 
11 and 18) in a fasted state, athletes provided saliva sam-
ples. The samples were collected in multiple sterile ali-
quots (Eppendorf type, 3000 μL per sample) over a timed 
5-min period and stored at −80 °C until assay. After thaw-
ing, saliva samples were centrifuged at 4000 rev min−1 
for 10 min at +4 °C. The samples were analyzed for sali-
vary immunoglobulin-A (sIgA) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in 
accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations (EIA 
kits, Salimetrics©, State College, PA, USA). The assay for 
[IgA]s had an intraassay CV of 4.5–6.9 % over a concentra-
tion range of 91.1–805.4 µg mL−1 and an interassay CV of 
8.9–8.6 % over 25.3–204.1 µg mL−1. The assay for [IL-6]s 
had an intraassay CV of 3–10 % over a concentration range 
of 4–323 pg mL−1 and an interassay CV of 8–6 % over 
9–342 µg mL−1.
Illness symptoms
The occurrence of upper tract respiratory infections (URTI) 
was evaluated using the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory 
Symptom Survey-21 (WURSS-21) (Barrett et al. 2009). 
The WURSS-21 includes one global severity question, 
ten symptom-based questions, nine functional impairment 
or quality-of-life questions, and one global change ques-
tion. The severity of each reported symptom was rated on 
a seven-point scale: 1 (very mild), 3 (mild), 5 (moderate), 
and 7 (severe). An overall symptom score was calculated 
by adding the severity scores from all items except the first 
and the last as they have categorically different reference 
domains. The questionnaire was performed every day on 
the 3 weeks of phase II, and was administered at the same 
period of the day in a quiet place. All athletes had prior 
knowledge about the completion of the questionnaire. For 
 1946
 
Eur J Appl Physiol (2016) 116:1941–1954
1 3
comparison between weeks, the average of all answered 
questionnaires at each stage was used. Higher scores indi-
cate more severe symptoms (the theoretical maximum 
score being 133) whilst a score of 0 indicates the complete 
absence of symptoms.
Sleep monitoring
During both phases I and II, subjects’ sleep patterns (i.e., 
sleep quantity and quality) were monitored continuously 
using an Actiwatch worn on the non-dominant wrist (Cam-
bridge Neurotechnology Ltd., UK) with the epoch length set 
to 1 min. Athletes were monitored in their home environ-
ment every day during phase I (21 days), and during phase II 
(21 days). Mean behavioral activity over the entire recording 
period was automatically calculated using the Sleepwatch 
software (Actiwatch activity and sleep analysis version 5.28, 
Cambridge Neurotechnology, Ltd.). Wristwatch actigra-
phy is a non-intrusive tool used to estimate sleep efficiency, 
which has been validated for reliability (Sadeh 2011). When 
compared with polysomnography, results show an accuracy 
of up to 80 % in sleep disordered patients for total sleep time 
and sleep efficiency (Kushida et al. 2001).
Sleep-wake scoring can be reliably obtained only with 
additional information provided by manually completed 
sleep logs (Fietze et al. 2009). All participants were, there-
fore, requested to complete daily sleep diaries, indicating 
the times of going to bed, falling asleep, waking up, and 
leaving the bed. In addition, participants were asked to 
mark the time of switching off the light to sleep and wake-
up time by pressing the button on the face of the Actiwatch.
Individual nights of sleep were analyzed for the follow-
ing range of variables:
• time in bed (h): the total amount of time spent in bed 
between bedtime and get-up time;
• bedtime (hh:mm): the self-reported clock time at which 
a participant went to bed to attempt to sleep;
• get-up time (hh:mm): the self-reported clock time at 
which a participant got out of bed;
• sleep latency (min): the amount of time between bed-
time and sleep start;
• actual sleep time (hh:mm): assumed sleep time as deter-
mined by the algorithm, taking into account immobile 
time;
• sleep efficiency (%): actual sleep time expressed as a 
percentage of time in bed;
• fragmentation index: a measure of restlessness during 
sleep, using the percentage of epochs where activity is 
>0;
• immobile time (min): the actual time spent immobile in 
bed.
To quantify how the training weeks affected the per-
ceived sleep quality, the participants reported their per-
ceived feelings on a seven-point scale, going from very, 
very good (=1) to very, very poor (=7) after waking up 
each morning (Hooper et al. 1995).
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted using the soft-
ware Statistica 6.1 (StatSoft). All data are expressed as 
mean ± SD. Normality of data was tested using a Shap-
iro–Wilk test. Values at baseline for age, body composi-
tion, and experience in endurance sport, MAP, VO2max and 
dietary habits were compared between groups (i.e., sleep 
low, SL and sleep normal, CON) using a one-way ANOVA. 
Two-ways (group × time) ANOVA were used to examine 
differences in dependent variables (i.e., sleep characteris-
tics, perceived sleep, illness symptoms, blood and saliva 
markers of immune response) between groups means at 
each time point of the protocol. When a significant main 
effect was found, pairwise comparisons were conducted 
using Newman–Keuls post hoc analysis. Effect sizes were 
also calculated using partial eta squared (η2
p) values. Values 
of 0.1, 0.3 and over 0.5 were, respectively, considered as 
small, medium and large effects. For all tests, the signifi-
cance level was set at P < 0.05.
Results
Data presented in this article derived from the same experi-
mental protocol presented by Marquet et al. (2016) and 
thus are complementary to those already presented by Mar-
quet et al. (2016).
Effects on chronometric performance on the 10 km 
running race
A significant enhancement of the chronometric perfor-
mance on the simulated 10 km running race was recorded 
at the end of the training program for all participants of the 
SL group, whereas no difference was recorded in the CON 
group (for more details about performance tests, refer to 
Marquet et al. 2016).
Effects on dietary patterns over the experimental 
protocol
The macronutrient intake significantly changed between 
phase II and phase I in similar proportions between SL and 
CON groups, mainly with an increase in carbohydrate and 
protein intake between phase I and II without significant

changes in energy intake (for more details about the macro-
nutrient intake, refer to Marquet et al. 2016).
As depicted in Table 1(A) and (B), the micronutrient 
intake (vitamin A, B1, B2, B3, B6, B9, B12, C, D, E and mag-
nesium, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, iron, 
zinc, copper, manganese, selenium) was not significantly 
altered between phase II and phase I and no significant dif-
ference was recorded between SL and CON groups.
Effects on blood and saliva immune and inflammatory 
variables
There were no significant differences in circulating num-
bers of leukocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, 
basophils or lymphocytes between groups and between 
the different phases of the protocol (Table 2). Plasma cor-
tisol levels were not modified throughout the protocol 
and were not different between groups (Table 3). No sig-
nificant change was recorded in salivary IL-6 concentra-
tion (Table 3). Salivary IgA decreased over the experimen-
tal protocol only in the SL group (Table 3; from 391.8 to 
245.1 µg L−1, P < 0.05, d = 0.23 from PRE to POST inter-
vention). The vitamin D status decreased along the pro-
tocol in similar proportions between groups (Fig. 3; from 
29.6 ± 7.4 to 27.8 ± 5.9 ng mL−1 and from 22.4 ± 10.6 to 
19.4 ± 8.1 ng mL−1, P < 0.05, d = 0.18 between PRE and 
POST intervention, in SL and CON groups, respectively).

groups is depicted in Fig. 4. The 3 weeks of sleep low pro-
gram did not modify significantly the WURSS-21 scores, 
in comparison with the CON group. The SL group’s aver-
age score (4.5) was very low and not found to differ to a 
significant extent compared to the CON group (7.7). The 
maximum scores recorded were 59 for one subject (1 day 
in the second week) of the SL group and 39 for one subject 
in the CON group (1 day in the first week).
Effects on perceived sleep quality and sleep actigraphy
A summary of variables related to sleep quality and quan-
tity is presented in Table 4. There was no significant time-
group interaction in perceived sleep quality, get-up time, 
sleep latency, fragmentation index, and number of immo-
bile minutes between phases I and II. In both groups, all 
subjects went to bed earlier (on average −20 and −27 min 
in the SL and CON groups, respectively, P < 0.05, 
d = 0.28) in the phase II than phase I and woke-up at the 
same time. As such, time in bed significantly increased in 
similar proportions in both groups (on average +13 and 
+15 min in the SL and CON groups, respectively, P < 0.05, 
d = 0.22). However, as depicted in Fig. 5, the actual sleep 
duration (i.e., the time asleep from sleep start to sleep end, 
less awakening episodes) was not significantly modified 
between phase I and II in both groups. Sleep efficiency 
slightly decreased only in the SL group (Fig. 6; P < 0.05, 
d = 0.25) and the fragmentation index tended to increase 
only in the SL group (Fig. 7; P = 0.06).
Discussion
A growing number of studies support the interest of per-
forming some training sessions with a low glycogen avail-
ability to enhance the adaptation to training and endurance 
performance. In a recently published work from our team 
(Marquet et al. 2016), we showed a significant improve-
ment in endurance performance and running efficiency fol-
lowing a 3-week training program including the sleep low 
strategy, i.e., delaying the replenishment of glycogen stores 
over night and training fasted the next morning. However, 
reducing the energy availability around training sessions 
is also well known to increase the risk of mal adaptation 
to training, including immunodepression and an increased 
incidence of URTI. This is the reason why we also investi-
gated the effect of the sleep low training program presented 
by Marquet et al. (2016) on selected immune parameters, 
the prevalence of URTI and sleep disturbances in endur-
ance athletes. One of the main complementary findings 
presented in this article is that the enhancement of perfor-
mance previously described after the SL protocol (Mar-
quet et al. 2016) was accompanied by a slight decrease in 
sleep efficiency and slight alterations of some indicators of 
immune function.
Effects on immune parameters and the incidence or 
URTI
The effects of exercise on immune function are well docu-
mented in the literature. Taken together, results indicate 
that exercise can have either positive or negative impact on 
immunity, depending on the nature, intensity and duration 
of exercise, as well as athlete fitness (Nieman 2000). Regu-
lar moderate exercise may enhance immunity and lower the 
risk or URTI by 20–45 % compared with a sedentary life-
style (Matthews et al. 2002; Nieman et al. 2011). On the 
other hand, heavy exercise or periods of chronic exercise 
may impair immune function and raise the risk of URTI by 
decreasing resting levels of saliva secretory immunoglobu-
lin-A (sIgA), leukocytes and neutrophil function (Fahlman 
and Engels 2005; Gleeson 2007; Gleeson et al. 1999). In 
addition, inadequate dietary feedings such as deficiency in 
specific macro- and/or micronutrients or negative energy 
balance, may contribute to impaired immunity and increase

the risk of infection (Gunzer et al. 2012). Interestingly, in 
this study, resting immune variables were not significantly 
modified by the training/nutrition intervention, and the inci-
dence of URTI was not increased in both groups. The num-
ber of white blood cells and the incidence of URTI were 
not significantly altered by the 3 weeks of training, com-
prising yet nine high intensity training (HIT) sessions and 
nine low intensity training (LIT) sessions performed after 
an overnight fast. This result was unexpected considering 
the high risk of immunodepression classically reported dur-
ing the early recovery period after HIT sessions, and accen-
tuated by the deprivation in carbohydrates (Gunzer et al. 
2012). Only the vitamin D status decreased from pre to post 
intervention but in similar proportions between groups. 
This decrease in vitamin D was accompanied with a slight 
decrease in sIgA concentration (d = 0.23) only in the SL 
group over weeks of training. This result is in conform-
ity with previous studies reporting a positive correlation 
between the vitamin D status and the sIgA secretion (He 
et al. 2014). However, it is worth noting that the decrease in 
vitamin D could have been also induced by the low direct 
exposition to UVB, since this study was conducted in the 
winter season at a high latitude (Paris, 53°N). While the 
mean vitamin D was quite low for all participants, no ath-
letes were deficient in vitamin D at the end of the protocol.

In our study, the absence of marked perturbations of 
immunity and URTI despite a chronic physiological stress 
could be explained by the particularity of our nutrition 
guidelines. Indeed, participants of the SL group were asked 
to perform all HIT sessions with high glycogen availability, 
whereas LIT sessions were performed with low glycogen 
availability after an overnight fast. However, the total daily 
carbohydrate intake (5.44 ± 1.20 g kg−1) and energy intake 
(2684 ± 500 kcal) were maintained similar to those of the 
CON group (5.65 ± 0.99 g kg−1 and 2837 ± 505 kcal), 
likely allowing the maintenance of the immune function 
throughout the protocol (Marquet et al. 2016). Indeed, car-
bohydrates are an important source of energy for immune 
cells (including lymphocytes, neutrophils and mac-
rophages) because their metabolic rates are extremely high 
(Gunzer et al. 2012). Most importantly all HIT sessions 
were performed with high glycogen stores, likely inducing 
a favorable effect on immunity. Costa et al. (2005) reported 
that training with high CHO availability lead to a stable glu-
cose level, decreased plasma cortisol level, and an increase 
in sIgA during 1 week training in well trained triathletes. 
On the contrary, maintaining a low CHO diet for the entire 
week induced a significant increase in cortisol level. In our 
study, cortisol level was not altered by the nutrition manip-
ulation, probably explaining in large part the maintenance 
of immune function for all our participants. Indeed, cortisol 
is known to have a suppressive effects on leukocyte func-
tion including immunoglobulin production, lymphocyte 
proliferation and NK cell activity (Bishop et al. 1999). 
CHO availability may also increase the anti-inflammatory 
cytokine response to exercise, as shown by Bishop et al. 
(2001b) through a significant increase in IL-6 concentra-
tion further to a cycling exercise performed in a low CHO 
diet (<1 g kg−1 per day) for 3 days prior to the exercise. 
On the contrary, in our study, IL-6 concentration was not 
significantly modified, probably explained by the CHO 
deprivation occurring only during night hours in each day. 
Finally one other factor which could explain the absence 
of immunosuppression in the SL group was the intake of a 
protein snack (15 g protein, 0 g CHO) before going to bed. 
Initially provided to limit the potential protein catabolism 
process during the night, ingesting protein in the recov-
ery phase after HIT sessions might have contributed to the 
maintenance of immune function. Among protein ingested, 
the specific role of the glutamine amino acid as a privileged 
energy provider to lymphocytes, macrophages and neutro-
phils, might be hypothesized (Hiscock and Pedersen 2002). 
Hence, ingesting a protein shake after exercise might have 
compensated the fall in plasma glutamine and associated 
immunosuppression. Moreover, in the SL group the CHO 
deprivation period occurred only during night— period 
during which participants slept and were not exposed to 
potential pathogen elements and stressors to the immune 
system such as cold, other people, or mental stress. Finally, 
well-maintained sleeping patterns throughout the protocol 
might likely have contributed to the absence of profound

perturbations of the immune system and on the very low 
incidence of URTI.
Effects on sleeping patterns
Since the first studies having reported that a lack of sleep 
may significantly alter metabolic, immune and cognitive 
function, the analyses of sleeping patterns in the sporting 
context have increased massively (Fullagar et al. 2015). 
Signs of sleep disturbances (e.g., troubles to fall asleep, 
increase of wake periods) are often recorded in particular 
after competitions or high intensity training sessions (Fulla-
gar et al. 2015). For example, Hausswirth et al. (2014) have 
reported a significant decrease in sleep quality and quantity 
in triathletes involved in a 3-week overload training pro-
gram (i.e., +30 % of habitual training load). In this latter 
study, the actual sleep duration was decreased by ~30 min 
every night during the training program, accompanied by a 
reduction of sleep efficiency and immobile time. Sleep dis-
ruptions are also classically reported in athletic populations 
training temporarily at high altitude or in hot conditions 
during training camps (Buchheit et al. 2016; Sargent et al. 
2013). Taken together, all data from the literature suggest 
that intensified training and/or the exposition to physiologi-
cal stressors (i.e., heat, altitude) increase the risk of sleep 
disturbance. Within this framework, it can be hypothesized 
that increasing the physiological stress through a nutritional 
manipulation during the recovery period could increase and 
even accentuate the risk of sleep disturbances.
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to 
provide an objective report of sleeping patterns in two 
groups of trained athletes under different nutrition guide-
lines (i.e., sleep with low glycogen availability vs. sleep 
with normal glycogen availability). This experimental 
situation involved a profound change of dietary habits for 
all participants, potentially increasing the risk of sleep

disturbances. Indeed, although carbohydrates are generally 
recommended at night to facilitate falling asleep (Halson 
2014), in our study they were avoided and replaced only 
by large amounts of vegetables and protein. However, 
surprisingly sleeping patterns were not markedly modi-
fied by the training/nutritional intervention. Sleep latency 
was not altered and participants even went to bed earlier 
(−13 and −15 min, P < 0.05, in the SL and CON group, 
respectively), while get-up time was not modified. In con-
sequence, actual sleep duration tended to be greater in both 
groups (+7 and +10 min, NS, in the SL and CON group, 
respectively). These results suggest that spontaneously, par-
ticipants went to bed earlier probably because of the fatigue 
felt after evening training sessions. The sleep quality was 
slightly altered since sleep efficiency decreased in the SL 
group (−1.1 %, d = 0.25) and the fragmentation index 
tended to increase (+4.1 %, P = 0.06), showing a small 
increase in wake episodes overnight. However, the overall 
perceived quality of sleep was not altered throughout the 
protocol suggesting only minor changes in sleep quality. 
Altogether, our results suggest that maintaining a normal 
daily CHO and calorie intake was effective in maintain-
ing normal sleeping pattern, allowing a good adaptation to 
training.
Implications for the manipulation of glycogen 
availability in training programs
This study has practical implications regarding the with-
holding of carbohydrates and lowered glycogen availabil-
ity implemented during short-term endurance training pro-
grams: it reveals a minimal effect on immune response and 
no effects on the occurrence of URTI; it reveals a minimal 
effect on sleeping patterns in trained triathletes; it raises

new insight on the distribution of carbohydrates around 
training sessions to avoid maladaptation.
Although manipulating carbohydrate availability around 
training sessions is more and more used by endurance ath-
letes to accentuate the training stimulus and get greater 
adaptation, to date no study had analyzed the potential 
side effects on the immune function. As inferred through 
objective markers of systemic and mucosal immune func-
tion as well as subjective markers of infection, the sleep 
low strategy (3 nights per week over 3 weeks) had no 
deleterious impact on the immune function. This posi-
tive result is likely explained by the maintenance of nor-
mal daily CHO (around 6 g kg−1 day−1) and energy intake 
(i.e., the CHO intake was matched between groups in this 
study). However, additional studies are necessary to con-
firm this result and analyze the impact of various dietary/
training manipulations on the immune function. Moreover, 
in our study, the vitamin D status decreased in both groups 
accompanied with a slight reduction in the sIgA secretion 
in the SL group (d = 0.23), suggesting a slight reduction 
in immune defense. Accordingly, a preliminary vitamin D 
status assessment possibly followed by a dietary supple-
mentation in vitamin D should be considered to optimize 
the immune status before engaging in a sleep low program, 
especially if started in the winter season.
Sleeping is often considered by coaches and trainers as 
the most effective recovery strategy. However, very limited 
data is available on the potential factors of influence, such 
as dietary feedings according to the distribution of training 
sessions. This study shows for the first time that sleeping 
patterns of trained athletes were not altered by a sleep low 
training strategy. Maintaining a normal CHO and energy

intake every day of the training program would be enough 
to counterbalance the potential negative impact of with-
holding CHO in the recovery phase after exercise before 
going to bed.
This study provides new evidence on the optimization 
of the carbohydrate distribution over day to limit the risk 
of maladaptation to training. High intensity training ses-
sions should be performed with high glycogen availability 
to maintain blood glucose concentration and thus immune 
function. The deprivation in CHO should occur in the 
recovery phase after HIT sessions organized overnight, to 
facilitate the glycogen depletion. Indeed, the night can be 
considered as a suitable period to withhold CHO (more 
convenient and easiest to endure a 7–8 h period of low gly-
cogen availability). Ingesting a dinner rich in vitamin, min-
erals (mainly from vegetables) and proteins might reinforce 
the immune defenses. Exercises with low glycogen avail-
ability should be performed at a low intensity (fasted in the 
morning) to lower the risk of infection. Finally, a particular 
attention should be brought on the ingestion of sufficient 
amounts of CHO between morning and evening sessions 
(from breakfast to afternoon snack) to provide a normal 
amount of CHO (around 6 g kg−1 day−1 in this study). The 
use of liquid sources of CHO like sports drinks and gels 
can facilitate the ingestion of enough CHO in a short period 
of time.
Conclusion
The purpose of this study was to test the effects of a 3-week 
sleep low training strategy (involving a withholding of CHO 
overnight) on immune function, the incidence or URTI and 
sleep patterns in trained endurance athletes. While the CON 
group maintained a normal CHO availability all time dur-
ing the protocol, the SL group stopped CHO intake from 
the afternoon training session until the next morning train-
ing session, so that they spend all night with reduced glyco-
gen availability. The main findings were that: (i) markers of 
systemic and mucosal immunity and the incidence of URTI 
were not significantly modified by the dietary intervention; 
(ii) sleep efficiency slightly decreased and the fragmenta-
tion index tended to increase only in the SL group. Overall, 
results derived from this study suggest that the risk of mal-
adaptation to training is minimal when withholding CHO 
overnight between high and low intensity training sessions, 
in the condition of maintaining a normal daily CHO and 
energy intake concentrated earlier over day.
