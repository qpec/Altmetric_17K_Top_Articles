Abstract
BACKGROUND—In a randomized trial comparing mitral-valve repair with mitral-valve 
replacement in patients with severe ischemic mitral regurgitation, we found no significant 
difference in the left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LVESVI), survival, or adverse events 
at 1 year after surgery. However, patients in the repair group had significantly more recurrences of 
moderate or severe mitral regurgitation. We now report the 2-year out-comes of this trial.
METHODS—We randomly assigned 251 patients to mitral-valve repair or replacement. Patients 
were followed for 2 years, and clinical and echocardiographic outcomes were assessed.
RESULTS—Among surviving patients, the mean (±SD) 2-year LVESVI was 52.6±27.7 ml per 
square meter of body-surface area with mitral-valve repair and 60.6±39.0 ml per square meter with 
mitral-valve replacement (mean changes from baseline, −9.0 ml per square meter and −6.5 ml per 
square meter, respectively). Two-year mortality was 19.0% in the repair group and 23.2% in the 
replacement group (hazard ratio in the repair group, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.46 to 1.35; P 
= 0.39). The rank-based assessment of LVESVI at 2 years (incorporating deaths) showed no 
significant between-group difference (z score = −1.32, P = 0.19). The rate of recurrence of 
moderate or severe mitral regurgitation over 2 years was higher in the repair group than in the 
replacement group (58.8% vs. 3.8%, P<0.001). There were no significant between-group 
differences in rates of serious adverse events and overall readmissions, but patients in the repair 
group had more serious adverse events related to heart failure (P = 0.05) and cardiovascular 
readmissions (P = 0.01). On the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire, there was a 
trend toward greater improvement in the replacement group (P=0.07).
CONCLUSIONS—In patients undergoing mitral-valve repair or replacement for severe ischemic 
mitral regurgitation, we observed no significant between-group difference in left ventricular 
reverse remodeling or survival at 2 years. Mitral regurgitation recurred more frequently in the 
repair group, resulting in more heart-failure–related adverse events and cardiovascular admissions.

 Ischemic mitral regurgitation is a serious consequence of coronary artery disease that carries 
a substantial risk of death from cardiovascular causes in proportion to its severity.1,2 
Ischemic mitral regurgitation is anatomically characterized by remodeling or distortion of 
left ventricular geometry that ultimately results in papillary-muscle displacement, leaflet 
tethering, and impaired coaptation. For the subgroup of patients with severe ischemic mitral 
regurgitation, the prognosis is grave, with rates of death ranging from 15 to 40% at 1 
year.2–4
For patients with severe ischemic mitral regurgitation, the benefit of surgical 
revascularization is undisputed, provided that the patient has suitable coronary targets 
affected by high-grade proximal lesions that compromise ischemic but viable myocardium. 
Expert consensus favors simultaneous correction of mitral regurgitation, although the 
question of which surgical strategy is the most effective remains controversial.5,6 Support for 
mitral-valve repair with a restrictive annuloplasty has been based on its relatively lower 
perioperative morbidity and mortality, as well as the presumed benefits of preserving the 
subvalvular apparatus to maintain left ventricular systolic function.7–10 However, this 
procedure can result in functional mitral stenosis11 and has been associated with a high rate 
of recurrent mitral regurgitation.12–16 Chordal-sparing mitral-valve replacement, on the 
other hand, is believed to provide more durable correction of mitral regurgitation with 
favorable ventricular remodeling,17 albeit in association with a higher risk of perioperative 
death,10,18 long-term thromboembolism, endocarditis, and structural valve deterioration.
The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network recently addressed the tradeoff between lower 
perioperative risk with restrictive mitral-valve repair and better long-term correction of 
mitral regurgitation with chordal-sparing replacement by conducting a multicenter, 
randomized trial comparing these two approaches in patients with severe ischemic mitral 
regurgitation.1 This trial showed no significant between-group differences in left ventricular 
reverse remodeling (as measured by the left ventricular end-systolic volume index 
[LVESVI]), survival, or clinical outcome at 1 year, although there was a significantly higher 
rate of recurrent moderate or severe mitral regurgitation in the repair group. We present here 
the 2-year echocardiographic and clinical outcomes of patients in that trial.
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN AND TRIAL OVERSIGHT
The study design has been described previously.1,19 The trial was conducted by the 
Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network and was funded by the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. The trial included 22 clinical centers 
with a coordinating center, an independent event-adjudication committee, and an NIH-
appointed data and safety monitoring board that oversaw trial progress. The institutional 
review board at each study center approved the protocol, which is available with the full text 
of this article at NEJM.org. The investigators vouch for the accuracy and completeness of 
the data and for the fidelity of this report to the trial protocol.

 PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS
We enrolled adults with chronic severe ischemic mitral regurgitation and coronary artery 
disease who were eligible for surgical repair or replacement of mitral valves, with or without 
coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG). We assessed severe ischemic mitral regurgitation 
using resting transthoracic echocardiography and integrative criteria20 that were verified by 
an independent core laboratory. (Details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, 
available at NEJM.org.) All patients provided written informed consent.
Eligible patients were randomly assigned to undergo either mitral-valve repair or chordal-
sparing replacement. Randomization was stratified according to center and blocked to ensure 
ongoing equivalence of group size. Mitral-valve repair was performed with the use of an 
approved complete rigid or semirigid annuloplasty ring, which was downsized to correct for 
annular dilatation. Mitral-valve replacement included complete preservation of the 
subvalvular apparatus. The technique of preservation, type of prosthetic valve, and technique 
of suture placement were at the discretion of the surgeon. Each treating cardiologist 
prescribed guideline-directed medical treatment, including aspirin, lipid-lowering agents, 
beta-blockers, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone antagonists, and cardiac-resynchronization 
therapy.
STUDY END POINTS
All patients were followed for 2 years, and end points were assessed at 30 days and at 6, 12, 
and 24 months. All study investigators were unaware of the overall outcome data. The 
primary end point was the degree of left ventricular reverse remodeling, which was defined 
as the LVESVI at 1 year after randomization, as assessed by means of transthoracic 
echocardiography, as reported previously.1 Secondary end points included left ventricular 
size and function at other time points and rates of death, major adverse cardiac or 
cerebrovascular events (a composite outcome that included death, stroke, subsequent mitral-
valve surgery, heart-failure hospitalization, or an increase in New York Heart Association 
[NYHA] class by one or more classes), serious adverse events, recurrent mitral 
regurgitation, and re-hospitalization, as well as quality of life.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The trial was designed to have a power of 90% to detect a difference of 15 ml per square 
meter of body-surface area in the LVESVI from baseline to 1 year, as reported previously.1 
We assumed a baseline LVESVI of 100 ml per square meter, improvements of 20 ml per 
square meter in the repair group and 35 ml per square meter in the replacement group, and a 
similar rate of death at 1 year of 10 to 20% in the two groups.21–23 The primary null 
hypothesis was that there would be no between-group difference in the LVESVI at 1 year.1
We used a two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare the LVESVI at 2 years in an 
intention-to-treat analysis at a 0.05 significance level. The test accommodated nonignorable 
missing data with respect to the LVESVI owing to death by assigning deceased patients the 
worst ranks in an order that was based on the time of death. We used multiple imputation for 
missing data that were not due to death for the 2-year LVESVI, assuming that data were 
missing at random (as described in the Supplementary Appendix). We used the log-rank test

 to compare rates of death and major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events, and we 
calculated hazard ratios from Cox regression models to quantify relative risks. Poisson 
regression was used to test group differences with respect to rates of adverse events. 
Functional status (according to NYHA and Canadian Cardiovascular Society classifications) 
was compared between groups with the use of chi-square tests. To assess patients’ quality of 
life, we used the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire, the European Quality 
of Life–5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), and the physical and mental subscales of the Medical 
Outcomes Study 12-Item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-12). Quality of life was 
analyzed with the use of a mixed-effects model.
RESULTS
PATIENTS
A total of 251 patients underwent randomization, 126 to mitral-valve repair and 125 to 
mitral-valve replacement (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The two groups had 
similar baseline characteristics (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The mean (±SD) 
LVESVI was 61.1±26.2 ml per square meter in the repair group and 65.7±27.3 ml per square 
meter in the replacement group. Concomitant procedures were performed in 86.1% of 
patients. Among patients in the repair group, the average annulus size was 31.0 mm and the 
average ring size was 27.9 mm; 92.9% of patients received a ring measuring 30 mm or less. 
Subvalvular procedures were used in 11.9% of patients in the repair group. Among those 
receiving valve replacement, 95.4% underwent a chordal-sparing procedure. Eleven patients 
who were assigned to the repair group underwent replacement (including 5 patients in whom 
no attempt at repair was made and 6 patients who underwent replacement after full repair), 
and 1 patient who was assigned to the replacement group underwent repair.
LEFT VENTRICULAR DIMENSIONS AND FUNCTION
The mean 2-year LVESVI among surviving patients was 52.6±27.7 ml per square meter in 
the repair group and 60.6±39.0 ml per square meter in the replacement group (mean change 
from baseline, −9.0 ml per square meter and −6.5 ml per square meter, respectively), with 
the vast majority of total improvement (81.8% in the repair group and 96.3% in the 
replacement group) occurring during the first year.
At 2 years, the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 42.5±11.8% in the repair group 
and 37.6±11.8% in the replacement group. The rank-based assessment of LVESVI at 2 years 
(incorporating death) showed no significant between-group difference (z score = −1.32, P = 
0.19).
RATES OF DEATH, REOPERATION, AND RECURRENCE
Outcomes at 30 days and 1 year have been described previously.1 At 2 years, we observed 
no significant difference in cumulative mortality between treatment groups, with a rate of 
19.0% in the repair group and 23.2% in the replacement group (Table 1), for a hazard ratio 
with mitral-valve repair of 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46 to 1.35; P = 0.39 by the 
log-rank test) (Fig. 1).

 Six patients who were assigned to the repair group were converted to valve replacement 
before leaving the operating room because the repair procedure did not sufficiently correct 
the mitral regurgitation, and 4 patients in the repair group underwent mitral-valve 
reoperation at a later date (at 10, 41, 268, and 434 days after the procedure). One recipient of 
a bioprosthesis in the replacement group underwent a mechanical replacement at 18 months 
to correct leaflet immobility and severe mitral regurgitation. Three patients in the 
replacement group had a paravalvular leak of mild severity but did not require intervention.
The proportion of patients with recurrent moderate or severe mitral regurgitation at some 
point during the 2-year period was significantly higher in the repair group than in the 
replacement group (58.8% vs. 3.8%, P<0.001). Severe mitral regurgitation was present in 
14% of the patients with recurrence in the repair group and in none of the patients in the 
replacement group. In the repair group, patients without recurrent moderate or severe mitral 
regurgitation within 2 years had a greater degree of reverse remodeling than did patients who 
had such regurgitation (LVESVI, 62.6±26.9 and 42.7±26.4, respectively; P<0.001).
At 2 years, 75 of 111 patients (67.6%) who underwent mitral annuloplasty died, had 
moderate or severe mitral regurgitation, or underwent mitral-valve reoperation, as compared 
with 31 of 107 patients (29.0%) in the replacement group (relative risk, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.69 to 
3.22; P<0.001). Rates of the composite end point over time are provided in Fig. 2.
COMPOSITE CARDIAC END POINT, ADVERSE EVENTS, AND HOSPITALIZATION
At 2 years, the rates of major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events did not differ 
significantly between the treatment groups (42.1% in the repair group and 42.4% in the 
replacement group) (Table 1), for a hazard ratio of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.66 to 1.42; P = 0.88 by 
the log-rank test) (Fig. 3). There also was no significant difference in the rate of the 
individual components of the primary end point (Table 1). The repair group had significantly 
more serious heart-failure events at 2 years (24.0 per 100 patient-years vs. 15.2 per 100 
patient-years, P = 0.05), although the rates of other serious adverse events were not 
significantly different between groups. Overall readmission rates did not differ between 
groups, but patients in the repair group had a significantly higher rate of readmission for 
cardiovascular causes (48.3 vs. 32.2 per 100 patient-years, P = 0.01). This difference was 
largely driven by rehospitalization for heart failure and the need for an implantable 
cardioverter–defibrillator or permanent pacemaker (59 readmissions in the repair group and 
38 in the replacement group, for rates of 30.6 vs. 20.7 per 100 patient-years; P = 0.06).
QUALITY OF LIFE
The pattern of change in quality-of-life measures over the duration of follow-up was similar 
in the two groups, with most improvement occurring in the first 6 months after surgery. 
There were no significant between-group differences in scores on the SF-12 physical and 
mental subscales or in the EQ-5D scores. On the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure 
questionnaire (with scores ranging from 0 to 105, with higher scores indicating a worse 
quality of life), there was a trend toward greater overall improvement in scores among 
patients in the replacement group as compared with those in the repair group (Fig. 4). At 2 
years, the mean change in heart-failure symptoms from baseline was 20.0 in the repair group

 versus 27.9 in the replacement group (P = 0.07). Among all patients regardless of treatment 
assignment, the improvement from baseline was 26.6 among patients who did not have 
recurrent mitral regurgitation versus 16.2 among those with recurrence (P=0.04).
DISCUSSION
The results of this 2-year study advance our understanding of the relative benefits of mitral-
valve repair and mitral-valve replacement for the management of severe ischemic mitral 
regurgitation. As in the 1-year study, we observed no significant between-group difference in 
the rank-based assessment of left ventricular reverse remodeling at 2 years. Although the 
LVESVI significantly improved over baseline in the two groups during the first year after 
surgery, there was little further improvement during the second year. Similarly, in the second 
year after surgery, there were few additional deaths, which were equivalently distributed 
between the two groups. As such, we observed nonsignificant differences in 2-year mortality 
(19.0% in the repair group and 23.2% in the replacement group), although the study had 
insufficient power to draw any definitive conclusions about the relative effects of the two 
surgical procedures on survival. The rates of death that we observed in our trial were 
consistent with results that have been published previously.24,25
However, we observed that the recurrence of mitral regurgitation, which was mostly 
moderate in degree, remained a progressive and excess hazard for patients undergoing 
mitral-valve repair. During the 2-year follow-up period, 58.8% of patients in the repair group 
had moderate or severe regurgitation, as compared with 3.8% in the replacement group. This 
deficiency in the durability of correction of mitral regurgitation is disconcerting, given that 
recurrence confers a predisposition to heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and repeat 
interventions and hospitalizations.26–28 We found that patients in the repair group had more 
serious adverse events of heart failure and hospital readmission for cardiovascular causes. 
The findings of the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire, although not 
conclusive, were consistent with these clinical events. The 7.9-point difference in average 
improvement over baseline in favor of the replacement group was not significant (P = 0.07), 
but the magnitude of change exceeded the 5-point threshold for clinically meaningful 
improvement used in other studies.29
Our results reflect the expertise of experienced surgeons, as reflected in the low 30-day 
mortality (1.6% for repair and 4.0% for replacement), as compared with the national rates of 
5.3% and 8.5%, respectively, reported by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons.30 With the 
exclusion of the 6 patients who required conversion to mitral-valve replacement, patients in 
the repair group left the operating room with only trace or no mitral regurgitation. Ninety-
three percent of patients received a mitral-valve ring measuring 30 mm or less; the average 
valve annulus size was 31.0 mm, and the average ring size was 27.9 mm. Among the 
patients who underwent mitral-valve replacement, only 3 were found to have paravalvular 
leaks, all of which were mild in severity and did not require subsequent intervention.
Patients in the repair group who did not have recurrent mitral regurgitation had significant 
reverse remodeling. Moreover, among all the patients who underwent randomization, the 
absence of recurrent moderate or severe mitral regurgitation was associated with a better

 quality of life, as measured on the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire. These 
findings raise the question of whether the selection of patients for repair could be improved 
by identifying baseline clinical or echocardiographic predictors of recurrence of mitral 
regurgitation. Echocardiography-based studies have identified several valvular measures 
(e.g., tenting area and coaptation distance) and ventricular measures (e.g., LVESVI and 
sphericity index) as possible predictors of recurrent mitral regurgitation.7,14,31–36 Our 
previous analysis did not corroborate these observations and identified only the presence of a 
basal aneurysm or dyskinesis as an independent predictor of recurrent mitral regurgitation.37 
The need to identify the best candidates for restrictive annuloplasty is an important area for 
further research.
Such studies need to be paired with investigations that further elucidate the mechanism 
underlying recurrence of mitral regurgitation in recipients of restrictive annuloplasty. It has 
been suggested that the persistence or recurrence of mitral regurgitation after restrictive 
annuloplasty is due to augmented leaflet tethering caused by the anterior displacement of the 
posterior leaflet,31 as well as progressive adverse global and localized left ventricular 
remodeling.38 Therefore, there is potential for restrictive annuloplasty alone to potentiate a 
tendency to regurgitation. Adjunctive subvalvular procedures that address pathologic leaflet 
tenting in combination with restrictive annuloplasty are undergoing investigation.39
Mitral-valve replacement provides considerably more durable correction of mitral 
regurgitation, which may have an important effect on long-term outcomes but must be 
weighed against the adverse consequences related to the use of a prosthetic valve. In the first 
2 years of this trial, we observed mild paravalvular leaks in 3 patients, prosthetic-valve 
endocarditis in 2 patients, and the need for mitral-valve reoperation for leaflet immobility in 
1 patient. There was no increased incidence of serious thromboembolic or bleeding events 
among patients in the replacement group, as compared with the repair group. Longer-term 
follow-up is needed to more fully assess the frequency of these events in recipients of 
prosthetic valves.
This trial has several limitations. First, the primary end point was an echocardiographic 
measure of left ventricular remodeling, not a clinical outcome such as survival. A 
randomized trial with a 1-year or 2-year end point of death would have required the 
inclusion of thousands of patients. On the other hand, there is strong evidence correlating the 
LVESVI with clinical outcomes, including NYHA class, hospitalization, and survival.40–43 
Second, transthoracic echocardiography may have underestimated the presence and severity 
of mitral regurgitation in patients after replacement. However, among the patients in the 
replacement group, the mitral-valve inflow velocities and estimated diastolic gradients were 
within the normal ranges for the sizes of the prostheses that were implanted, which suggests 
the absence of substantial mitral regurgitation. Finally, the observations were made during a 
relatively short period. Additional events would be captured with longer follow-up in these 
patient cohorts.
In conclusion, at 2 years after either mitral-valve repair or mitral-valve replacement for 
severe ischemic mitral regurgitation, there were no significant between-group differences 
with respect to left ventricular reverse remodeling or survival. However, the rate of

 recurrence of moderate or severe mitral regurgitation was significantly higher with mitral-
valve repair, resulting in more heart-failure–related adverse events and cardiovascular 
admissions.

 Figure 1. Time-to-Event Curves for Death
Shown are the proportions of patients who died in the mitral-valve (MV) repair group and 
the mitral-valve replacement group at 2 years. The most frequent underlying causes of death 
were multisystem organ failure (in 20.8% of patients), heart failure (in 17.0%), and sepsis 
(in 13.2%). The tick marks indicate censored data.

 Figure 4. Quality-of-Life Scores
Shown are the mean scores on the Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short-Form General 
Health Survey (SF-12) for physical health (Panel A) and mental health (Panel B). The SF-12 
scale ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health. Panel C shows mean 
scores on the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire, which ranges from 0 to 
105, with higher scores indicating a lower quality of life. Panel D shows mean scores on the 
European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) survey, with scores ranging from 0 to 100, 
with higher scores indicating a better quality of life.
