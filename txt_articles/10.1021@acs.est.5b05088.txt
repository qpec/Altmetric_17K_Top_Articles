ABSTRACT: Avoiding food loss and waste may counteract the
increasing food demand and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions from the agricultural sector. This is crucial because of
limited options available to increase food production. In the year
2010, food availability was 20% higher than was required on a
global scale. Thus, a more sustainable food production and
adjusted consumption would have positive environmental
effects. This study provides a systematic approach to estimate
consumer level food waste on a country scale and globally, based
on food availability and requirements. The food requirement
estimation considers demographic development, body weights,
and physical activity levels. Surplus between food availability and
requirements of a given country is considered as food waste. The global food requirement changed from 2,300 kcal/cap/day to
2,400 kcal/cap/day during the last 50 years, while food surplus grew from 310 kcal/cap/day to 510 kcal/cap/day. Similarly, GHG
emissions related to the food surplus increased from 130 Mt CO2eq/yr to 530 Mt CO2eq/yr, an increase of more than 300%.
Moreover, the global food surplus may increase up to 850 kcal/cap/day, while the total food requirement will increase only by
2%−20% by 2050. Consequently, GHG emissions associated with the food waste may also increase tremendously to 1.9−2.5 Gt
CO2eq/yr.
■ INTRODUCTION
The global food demand is projected to increase by 60%−110%
between 2005 and 2050,1−4 mainly due to population growth
and diet shifts.5,6 A solution to meet the increasing food
demand is to reduce food loss and waste.7 This would in
parallel also dampen global warming because emissions from
food production would be reduced. Currently, around one-
third of global food production (about 1.3 billion tonnes per
year) is lost or wasted.8 Avoiding food loss and waste can also
save resources used in food production, reduce environmental
impacts of agriculture, and enhance local, regional, and global
food security.9−11 Directly and indirectly, the agricultural sector
contributes to around 22%−24% of the total anthropogenic
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and is accountable for 56%
of the total non-CO2 GHG emissions.12 This study provides a
systematic approach to tackle the food waste challenge and
associated emissions.
Food loss and waste occur in various stages of the food
supply chain.8 The reduction of edible food during production,
postharvest, and processing is considered as food loss, whereas
food waste is referred to food discarded by the consumer.8,13
Food losses occur mostly in developing countries due to less
efficient infrastructure, while food wastes are common in
developed countries.5,13 Around 30%−40% of food is lost or
wasted in both developing and developed countries.5
Estimating food loss and waste within the various stages of
the food supply chain is a challenging task. Different methods
are used to investigate food loss and waste, resulting in
incompatible estimates. Methods such as surveys, measure-
ments of plate waste, and direct examination of garbage are
applied to estimate food wasted in a population sample.14,15 On
a country level, food loss and waste are often calculated by
applying specific loss factors to various stages of the food
supply chain.9,16 Alternatively, Hall et al.10 considered the food
surplus of the United States, accounting for differences between
food availability and modeled food energy requirements as
aggregated food loss and waste.
Food energy requirements indicate the calorie expenditure
needed for a person to keep his/her body functioning, which
depends on age, sex, body weight, and physical activity
levels.17,18 On a country level, the energy requirements
consequently depend on demographic structure. For example,
a country with a large share of adults in the population requires
higher food energy per person than a country with a younger
population. Therefore, the average food energy requirement per
person for any given country will alter with changes in its
average body weight, demographic structure, and physical
activity level.
For a healthy population, food consumption is equivalent to
the energy requirement; food consumption above or below the
energy requirement results in nutritional imbalance.4 Therefore,

 the difference between the food availability in a country and the
energy requirement of its population can be used as a
standardized comparable method to estimate food waste at
the consumer level.10 However, such standardized global food
waste estimation for all countries has not yet been performed.
The goal of this study is to address this missing link by
calculating food waste for all countries. Further, we estimate
agricultural GHG emissions associated with the food waste and
present the importance of reducing food waste in terms of
global warming. Specifically, we calculate country level food
energy requirements accounting for past, present, and future
demographic structures, different physical activity levels, and
possible body weight variations with global coverage. We
assemble data on average body weight according to age and sex
groups for each country from various sources. Subsequently, we
calculate the differences between the food availability and the
estimated energy requirements of the countries to understand
food waste.
■ MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human Energy Requirements. Humans require food and
its macronutrient constituents, i.e. carbohydrates, fats, and
proteins, as an energy source for maintaining body size and
composition, for physical activities, and they require additional
energy for growth, pregnancy, and lactation. The two major
factors determining the energy requirements are basal
metabolic rate (BMR) and physical activity level (PAL).18
BMR is the minimum amount of energy required for life
functioning, which depends on the body weight, age, and sex of
a person.19 The PAL value expresses a person’s daily physical
activity, which depends on lifestyles. For example, a population
group of light, moderate, and heavy activity lifestyles have PAL
values of 1.55, 1.75, and 2.4, respectively.18
We estimate the average per capita daily food requirement
for the population of a country from 1950 to 2010 for a five
years resolution by using demographic and anthropometric
data. The demographic data comprises of population by age
and sex groups.20 The anthropometric data covers average body
weight by age and sex groups from various sources for the most
recent years (Tables S1 and S2). Body weight data is available
for 71 countries, comprising 73% of the global population in
2010.20 The data gaps are filled by calculating population-
weighted average body weight for the United Nations
subregions based on the available data. In the analysis, the
body weight is kept constant because the data is available only
for a few years.
Due to the fact that no standardized global data on PAL for
countries is available, three PAL scenarios (light, moderate, and
heavy) are considered to account for uncertainty (Table 1). We
take the average PAL values for nonoverweight adults in the
United States by age and sex groups18 as moderate PAL.
Minimum dietary energy requirements are estimated by using a
PAL value of 1.55,21 which also represents the lower bound for
food requirements (light PAL). PAL values larger than 2.4 are
difficult to maintain permanently.18 Thus, this value is
considered as the upper bound (heavy PAL). Because of the
limited physical activity of the elderly, for age groups older than
80 years the PAL values are kept constant, at 1.28 for males and
1.19 for females for all PAL scenarios, based on observed PAL
values for elderly in the United States.18
The energy requirements are separately calculated for four
groups: (i) infants, children, and adolescents (0−19 years), (ii)
adults (20−59 years), (iii) elders (60+ years), and (iv)
pregnant and lactating women. The age cohort of infants,
children, and adolescents is further divided into four groups
(0−4, 5−9, 10−14, and 15−19 years) based on the age groups
for which population data is available. We estimate the energy
requirements for infants, children, and adolescents by multi-
plying the population data according to age and sex groups by
their respective average daily energy requirement for different
PALs obtained from FAO/WHO/UNU18 (Table S3).
The energy requirements for adults and elderly are calculated
by multiplying the population data according to age and sex
groups by their respective BMR and PALs. Human BMR
changes with age18 and is represented by the Schofield
equation19

where BMR is a linear function of body weight (BW), and
where constant (C) and slope (S) depend on age and sex
groups (Table 1).
In the next step, the extra energy required for a 40-week
pregnancy and a 6-month lactation period is calculated. A
woman requires an additional food of 280 kcal/day and 590
kcal/day of food on average during her pregnancy and lactation
period, respectively.18 The number of pregnant women (Npreg)
in a country is estimated by

where BR denotes crude birth rate; P represents population in a
year (365.25 days); and GP is a mean gestation period of 280
days from Naegele’s rule. We use crude birth rate data,20 as it is
widely available compared to data on pregnancy rate.
Finally, the total food requirement in a country is calculated
by summing up the food requirements of the four groups. The
average food requirement of a country is obtained by dividing
the total food requirement by the total population of the
country.
Food Surplus and Deficit. We define food surplus and
deficit as the difference between available and required food
calories disregarding different food types. Food Balance Sheet
(FBS)22 consists of data on the daily amount of food supply in
a country from 1961 onward. The food supply data provides

considered as moderate PAL. The PAL value of 1.55, used to estimate
minimum dietary energy requirements,21 is taken as light PAL. For the
heavy PAL, we assumed a value of 2.4 as higher values would be
difficult to maintain permanently.18 We kept the PAL value constant
for the age group older than 80 years due to the limited physical
activity of the elderly.

 information on amount of available food in a country for
consumption instead of real food intake that is mostly obtained
from individual diet surveys. Hence, the food supply data is
used to estimate food surplus and deficit between 1965 and
2010 in five year intervals. The analysis is performed for 169
countries that represent 97.95% of the world population in
201020 (Table S4).
FBS considers seed rates, stock changes, food loss in
postharvest, and types of utilization to calculate food
availability, based on country level data on food production
and trade.22 Therefore, the positive differences (surplus)
between food availability and requirement are attributed to
consumer food waste. A negative value represents a food deficit
in the country. Separately, we add food surplus and deficit of
countries to understand food surplus and deficit on global and
regional levels. Subsequently, the global food surplus and deficit
per capita is estimated by dividing sums of food surplus and
deficit on country scales by respective sums of country
populations. Additionally, we attempt to understand the
influence of development status on food surplus/deficit by
analyzing the relation between country level food surplus/
deficit and its Human Development Index (HDI).23
Greenhouse Gas Emissions. In order to assess the
potential impact of food waste on climate, GHG emissions
associated with food surplus are estimated, accounting for
vegetal and animal products. This is important because the
emission intensity of livestock production is larger than that of
crop production.6 It is assumed that shares of vegetal and
animal products in food surplus are equal to the shares within
available calories, i.e., fractions of consumed and wasted calories
are equal. This is supported by a South African study that
presents similar findings on the shares of vegetal and animal
products in food waste.24
Agriculture releases a significant amount of CO2, CH4, and
N2O to the atmosphere; however, only non-CO2 emissions are
reported in agricultural emission inventories (e.g., FAO22). This
is because agriculture itself is considered CO2 neutral and CO2
emissions from energy used for agriculture machineries,
transportation, and fertilizer production are accounted for in
the energy sector.12 Therefore, we use country level data on
agricultural non-CO2 GHG emissions and food production
from FAOSTAT22 to estimate GHG emissions associated with
food waste.
FAOSTAT considers the following agricultural production
and management activities to estimate agricultural GHG
emissions: enteric fermentation, manure management, manure
applied to soils, manure left on pasture, crop residues,
cultivation of organic soils, burning crop residues and savanna,
rice cultivation, and synthetic fertilizer applications.25 The
conversion of total crops and livestock production from tonnes
to calories is feasible by considering nutritive factors for crops
and livestock items.26 The countrywide emission intensity of
crop and animal products is estimated by dividing countrywide
non-CO2 GHG emissions related to crops (manure applied to
soils, crop residues, cultivation of organic soils, burning crop
residues and savanna, rice cultivation, and synthetic fertilizer
applications) and livestock (enteric fermentation, manure
management, and manure left on pasture) by production of
crop and livestock calories, respectively. Subsequently,
emissions associated with food surplus are estimated by
multiplying crop and animal calorie surplus with emission
intensities of crop and animal products, respectively.
Scenario Analysis. The scenario analysis is conducted to
understand the future food requirements, based on demo-
graphic changes and subsequent food surplus/deficit and
associated GHG emissions. For future projections (2015−
2050), three body weight scenarios, five demographic
projections, and three PAL values are considered, resulting in
45 estimates.
The three body weight scenarios are (i) current body weight
remain constant, (ii) all countries have the average body weight
of Japan, and (iii) all countries have the average body weight of
the United States. These two high-income countries represent
global extremes in terms of body weight.27 Hence, the body
weight scenarios cover possible upper and lower bounds of
future food requirements related to an increase or a decrease in
human body mass. This needs to be considered because body
weights are increasing globally.28,29
The future population development demographic projections
are based on the five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways
(SSPs).30 SSPs are a set of plausible alternative future
evolutions of society that would indicate a range of challenges
for climate change mitigation and adaptation.31 SSP1 depicts a
future evolution toward a more sustainable path. SSP2 assumes
a future that is following the historical trends and is considered
as the middle of the road scenario. A fragmented world that
emphasizes national security at the expense of international
development is reflected by SSP3. SSP4 assumes a future world
of high inequalities, both between and within countries. SSP5
refers to a future world that is based on a conventional
development path where economic growth fosters rapid
technological progress and development of human capital.
For the estimation of future food surplus/deficit, the food
demand projection from Pradhan et al.6 is considered. The food
demand is projected based on relationships between the HDI
and availability of total food and animal calories for 2010−2050
in a five year interval. However, the data on food availability is
currently available only until 2011.22 Therefore, the projected
food demand is adjusted to match the food demand projection
for 2010 with the food availability for ca. 2010 (2009−2011).
For this, the difference between the projected food demand for
2010 and the food availability for ca. 2010 is initially calculated
for each country. Afterward, the difference is added/subtracted
to the projected food demand of the country from 2010 to
2050.
Subsequently, emissions associated with food surplus are
estimated by following the procedure described above (see
Section Greenhouse Gas Emissions). Technological progress
and technology transfer that lowers emission intensities is an
option to reduce emissions from the agricultural sector.6,32
However, we keep emission intensities constant at the year
2010 level for this analysis to limit the number of scenarios.
Additionally, the aim of our study is to distinguish between the
future emissions reduction potential by avoiding food waste
and emission reduction potential by technological advance-
ment.
■ RESULTS
Food Requirements. During the last 50 years the global
average daily food requirement per person has increased from
2,320 kcal to 2,370 kcal, after a decrease of 40 kcal between
1950 and 1970 (Figure 1a, moderate PAL). These changes in
food requirements are mostly due to changing demographic
structures. For example, youth population (0−19 years) in
China grew from 44% to 51% between 1950 and 1970, while

C
 adult population (20−59 years) declined from 49% to 42%.20
This decreased the Chinese food requirement by 60 kcal/cap/
day (Figure 1b). After, the adult population grew to 60% by
2010,20 the food requirement increased to 2,420 kcal/cap/day.
Similarly, per capita food requirements in India decreased until
1960 (Figure 1c) because of youth population increase.20 After,
the growth of the adult population resulted in an increase in the
Indian food requirement to 2,240 kcal/cap/day by 2010.
Between 1950 and 1960, per capita food requirement of the
United States also decreased (Figure 1d) due to the baby boom
in the late 1950s.20 With declining birth rates in the 1960s and
constant birth rates after 1975, the food requirement increased
and stabilized to around 2,600 kcal/cap/day. In 2010, the total
food requirement of these three countries constituted 42% of
the global total.
Globally, country scale food requirements varied between
1,800 kcal/cap/day and 2,800 kcal/cap/day in 2010 (Figure
S1). Countries with heavy body weights (e.g., the United States,
Australia, etc.) required larger amounts of food compared to
countries with lighter body weights (e.g., China, India) [Figure
1 and Table S2]. Similarly, the light PAL provided the global
minimum food requirements, while the global maximum food
requirements are defined by the heavy PAL (Figure S2).
Looking into the future, the global food requirements will
increase to 2,390 kcal/cap/day by 2025 under SSP1 and SSP5
scenarios (Figure 1a, moderate PAL). Afterward, the food
requirements will decrease to 2,350 kcal/cap/day by 2050.
Similar values of decreasing food requirements by 2050 are
projected for China and India. SSP1 and SSP5 scenarios
suggest low fertility and mortality rates for the non-OECD
countries,30 which implies that their aging populations will
require comparatively lower amounts of food (Table 1). The
aging affect can be prominent for China as its share of
population above 60 years of age is projected to increase from
12% in 2010 to 37% by 2050.30 Similarly, the food
requirements will decrease after 2015 in the OECD countries,
due to SSPs’ medium (SSP1 and SSP2) or high (SSP5) fertility
assumptions.30 The lowest food requirements on a global scale
and for the non-OECD countries is estimated under the SSP3
scenario. This is due to high fertility and mortality assumptions
for the non-OECD countries, resulting in a younger global
population.30
Additionally, the global food requirements may slightly
decrease to 2,300 kcal/cap/day or increase to 2,560−2,620
kcal/cap/day by 2050 if the body weight of the global
population were from Japan or the United States, respectively
(Figure S3). The body weight can increase with lifestyles that
simulate overeating and can result in an overweight and obese
population. For populations that suffer from stunting and
wasting, proper supply of nutrients helps to gain a desirable
body weight and height, depending on genetic preconditions.
By 2050, the total food requirements for the global
population will be in the range of 6,400 trillion kcal/yr to
12,200 trillion kcal/yr, considering three body weight scenarios,
five demographic projections, and three PAL values. This
corresponds to 9% less and 73% more calories compared to the
7,100 trillion kcal/yr of food available in 2010. The mid range
of the food requirements is represented by the moderate PAL
with constant body weight, amounting to 7,300−8,400 trillion
kcal/yr (2%−20% more calories compared to food available in
2010). This mid range variation is mainly driven by the SSP
population scenarios that project 8.5−10 billion people by
2050.30 The global maximum, moderate, and minimum food
requirements, as defined by the three PALs, may be in the
ranges of 9,450−12,200 trillion kcal/yr, 7,150−9,300 trillion
kcal/yr, and 6,400−8,300 trillion kcal/yr by 2050, respectively.
A driver of these projected food requirements is human body
weight. If the global body weights were the same as the
Japanese body weight, the global food requirements would be
1−2% lower compared to constant body weight by 2050.
However, global body weights similar to body weight of the
United States would result in 10−12% higher food require-
ments.
Adequacy of Food Supply. Our calculations show that
food surplus is increasing and food deficit is decreasing globally
(Figures 2 and S4). Between 1965 and 2010, the food surplus
grew from 310 kcal/cap/day to 510 kcal/cap/day, and the food
deficit declined from 330 kcal/cap/day to 120 kcal/cap/day
(moderate PAL). The amount of surplus food is increasing
especially in most of the OECD countries, e.g., food surplus in
the United States has increased from 400 kcal/cap/day to 1,050
kcal/cap/day between 1965 and 2010. Food availability has
increased over the last few decades, whereas biophysical food
requirements have remained almost constant.
During this period, some countries have successfully
overcome a food deficit to have a food surplus. For example,
available food in China and India was 440 kcal/cap/day and
220 kcal/cap/day respectively below the required amount in
1965 (Figures 2). Due to economic development, the
nutritional situation in China and India improved, resulting in
a food surplus of 620 kcal/cap/day and 210 kcal/cap/day in
2010, respectively. This reflects the positive relationship
between country scale food availability, its per capita income,32
and HDI.6 Still, available food is lower than the required
amount in some low-income countries (e.g., Zambia and Haiti)
[Figure S4].
In 2010, 20% more food was available than required on a
global scale (Figure 2a, moderate PAL). While considering the
minimum and maximum food requirements, as defined by the
respective light and heavy PAL, the food surplus amounts to
Figure 1. Average food energy required per person between 1950 and
2050 for moderate physical activity level: (a) Globe, (b) China, (c)
India, and (d) the United States. The food energy requirements are
estimated using the current demographic data from the United
Nations20 for the period 1950−2010 and the future demographic
conditions based on the five Shared Socio-economic Pathways
(SSPs).30 The energy requirements are varying across time, mostly
reflecting change in demographic structures.

 750 kcal/day and 170 kcal/day in 2010, respectively (Figure
S5). On a country scale, a range between 40% less and 60%
more food was available compared to the required amount in
2010 (Figure 3, moderate PAL). This represents the
inefficiency in food distribution systems, resulting in either
too much or too little food. Food deficits are common in many
developing and least developed countries, resulting in people
living under hunger conditions and suffering from stunting and
wasting. Currently, around 800 million people are under-
nourished globally.33 In contrast, we estimated a food surplus of
20−50% of the required calories in most OECD and transition
countries in 2010, resulting in a global food surplus of 1,200
trillion kcal/yr. This amount of food is enough to feed around
1.4 billion people with a daily diet of 2,370 kcal/cap (the global
per capita food requirement). Food surplus, also represented by
the ratio of food availability to requirement, increases with HDI
(Figure 4). However, a few countries (e.g., Japan) have a
relatively high HDI and have low food surplus levels, depicting
the compatibility of development along with a reduced food
waste.
In the future, the food surplus will continue to grow in most
countries because of increasing food demand. By 2050, the
global food surplus may increase to around 850 kcal/cap/day
(Figure 2, moderate PAL and constant body weight). The
growth rate of available food compared to the required amount
will be more prominent in the transition countries. For
example, the food surplus in China and India may increase by
around 500 kcal/cap/day between 2010 and 2050 when these
countries follow historical trends (Figure 2). These countries
are the potential food waste hot-spots mainly due to large
population and increasing food surplus. In contrast, the food
surplus may increase to a lesser extent in most OECD
countries. For example, food surplus in the United States may
only increase by 200 kcal/cap/day between 2010 and 2050,
considering moderate PAL and constant body weight. Never-
theless, the food surplus in the United States will be 1,200 kcal/
cap/day by 2050. On global and country scales, surplus calories
Figure 2. Estimated food surplus/deficit per person between 1965 and
2050: (a) Globe, (b) China, (c) India, and (d) the United States. We
considered the differences between food availability22 and food energy
requirements as food surplus/deficit. We separately summed the food
surplus and deficit of countries to estimate per capita food surplus and
deficit on a global scale. Food surplus is increasing on global and
national scales, mainly due to growing food availability. Some
countries (e.g., China and India) evolved from suffering from food
deficit conditions to a food surplus status. In the future, food surplus
will further increase globally, considering the projected food demand6
and demographic projections based on the Shared Socio-economic
Pathways (SSPs).30

food requirement for 2010 in percentage. The negative values
represent food deficits and are depicted by greenish colors. The
positive values express food surplus and are illustrated with reddish

Food surplus is common in countries in the North, while food deficits
are prevailing in the South.

are depicted by the diameter of the bubbles. The 20 largest countries
in terms of population are marked in different colors. The legend list is
based on their ISO codes. The threshold for development is provided
by the vertical dashed line at the HDI value of 0.8.34 For pragmatic
reasons, it may not be possible to reduce food surplus to zero; hence,
we considered the maximum allowable surplus as 10% of the
requirement and depicted that by the horizontal dashed line.
Generally, availability and requirement ratios increase with growing
HDIs.

 would be higher when considering light PAL, and lower with
heavy PAL, due to corresponding minimum and maximum
food requirements (Figure S5).
By 2050, the global food deficit per capita may remain similar
to that in 2010. However, the total food deficit will decrease
from 17 trillion kcal/yr to 9−13 trillion kcal/yr between 2010
and 2050. This reflects that the nutritional situation will
continue to improve in some least developed countries, while in
others the situation may stagnate or get worse. For example,
food availability may remain almost constant in Central African
Republic and may decrease in Zambia between 2010 and 2050
(Figure S4). Extrapolation of HDI trends of both the Central
African Republic and Zambia provides respectively almost
constant and decreasing values.34 Hence, rapid progress in
human development conditions in such least developed
countries is essential to eliminate hunger and food deficit
situations.
Avoidable Emissions. Figure 5 presents the global non-
CO2 GHG emissions related to surplus crop and animal
calories. Between 1965 and 2010, these global emissions
increased by around 3 times, from 130 Mt CO2eq/yr to 530 Mt
CO2eq/yr (moderate PAL), because of a growing food surplus
(Figure 2a) and shifting diets. Globally, diets are changing
toward a larger share of animal products that have a higher
emission intensity in comparison to crops.6 This results in a
growing animal calorie surplus and increases the emissions
related to total food surplus.
Regionally and in 2010, Oceania, South America, and
Northern Europe have comparatively high per capita emissions
related to food surplus with values of 850 g CO2eq/cap/day,
680 g CO2eq/cap/day, and 410 g CO2eq/cap/day, respectively
(Table 2, moderate PAL). Although such emissions per capita
are relatively low in South and East Asia (100 and 210 g CO2eq/
cap/day, respectively), the regions present very high total
emissions related to food surplus due to larger populations. For
example, the emissions were estimated to amount to 120 Mt
CO2eq/yr in East Asia, of which 110 Mt CO2eq/yr was
contributed by China alone. Chinese food surplus emissions
have grown 13 times since 1985. A reason for this is the 138%
increase in the animal products share in the Chinese food
supply.
In the future, the global emissions related to food surplus will
continue to increase under all scenarios, reaching 1.9−2.5 Gt
CO2eq/yr by 2050 (moderate PAL and constant body weight).
The projected emissions are the highest under the SSP3
scenario and the lowest under the SSP1 and SSP5 scenarios.
Although the global food surplus by 2050 may range between
2.1−2.4 times that of the year 2010, the food surplus emissions
by 2050 may increase by 2.6−3.6 times compared to 2010. This
immense growth in the emissions can be attributed to changing
diet compositions. The highest range of food surplus emissions
is estimated under light PAL and the Japanese body weight
scenario, 2.6−3.3 Gt CO2eq/yr by 2050 (Figure S6). On the
other hand, the American body weight scenario and heavy PAL
provide the lowest food surplus emissions range of 70−90 Mt
CO2eq/yr by 2050.
By 2050, the emissions related to food surplus will be the
highest in South Asia (500−680 Mt CO2eq/yr), followed by
East Africa (270−430 Mt CO2eq/yr) and South America (220−
280 Mt CO2eq/yr), considering the moderate PAL and current
body weights (Table 2). Between 2010 and 2050, the emissions
share of South Asia to the global food surplus may increase
from 12% to 25%−27%, whereas East Asia’s share may decline
from 23% to 11%−14%. This is mainly due to the projected
increase in the South Asian population from 1.7 billion in 2010
to 2.2−2.8 billion, while the East Asian population is projected
to decline from 1.6 billion to 1.4−1.5 billion. Although the East
Asian food surplus per capita will be greater, the larger
population size in South Asia will result in a higher total food
surplus. Additionally, diet shifts and larger emission intensities
will contribute to these higher food surplus emissions. For
example, the emission intensity of animal calories in India (3.19
G CO2eq/kcal) is three times that of China (0.96 G CO2eq/
kcal). Furthermore, the share of animal products in Chinese
diets may increase from 25% in 2010 to 36% by 2050, while it
may double in India (11% to 2 2%).
■ DISCUSSION
Our discussion focuses on several key findings this study
presents on the interplay of food requirements, food waste,
food deficits, and associated GHG emissions. First, our study
highlights a small increase (100 kcal/cap/day) in the global
food requirements per person compared to a large increase in
the global food availability (650 kcal/cap/day) during the last
five decades. This led to the global food surplus.
Our global food requirement estimates per person (2,300−
2,400 kcal/day) vary slightly from that of Smil35 (2000−2300
kcal/day) and Walpole et al.27 (2550 kcal/day). This is because
we considered additional food requirement for youths and
pregnant and lactating women that was not accounted for by
Walpole et al.27 and Smil,35 respectively. By keeping the body
weight constant at the values of the most recent years, we
implicitly included food requirements for generating obesity
and underestimated the food surplus. It is found that increasing
food availability results in both an obesity epidemic and a food
waste.29 Hence, the underestimated food surplus that accounts
for increased body weight in the past can be considered as food
waste.
Figure 5. Estimated agricultural GHG emissions associated with food
surplus between 1965 and 2050. The emissions were calculated
initially for countries based on country scale emission intensity for
crop and animal calorie production, which were multiplied by crop and
animal calorie surplus, respectively. Globally, GHG emissions
associated with food surplus have increased in the last five decades.
In the future, these emissions will further increase globally considering
the projected food demand6 and demographic projections based on
the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs).30 Note, while Figures 1
and 2 show per capita quantities, here total emissions are displayed.

 We estimated the global food requirements to increase by
2%−20% by 2050 compared to the food available in 2010
(under a moderate PAL and constant body weight scenario).
Compared to food demand that is projected to increase by
60%−110% between 2005 and 2050,1,2,4 our future food
requirement estimates are lower. The projected food demands
are based on the food availability data that includes both food
requirements and food waste. Hence, the food demand
projections to a large extent reflect growing food waste rather
than food requirements. Therefore, reducing food loss and
waste that lowers overall food demand can be an option to feed
the growing population. Dampening the food demand is crucial
due to restricted options to increase food production because
of limited land availability for agriculture expansion36 and
constraints related to conventional intensification approaches.37
Second, this study emphasizes growing food waste across the
globe by applying a consistent method to estimate food waste
from 1965 to 2050. So far, food loss and waste are estimated by
using waste factors in each step of the food supply chain.8
However, we calculated food waste based on available and
required calories. Our global food waste estimate of 510 kcal/
cap/day in 2010 that is larger than the consumer level food
waste of 214 kcal/cap/day estimated by Kummu et al.9
FAOSTAT accounts for postharvest food loss while calculating
food availability.22,26 However, Kummu et al.9 used the food
availability data from FAOSTAT and additionally considered
the postharvest food loss while estimating food loss and waste.
This resulted in a lower value. On a country scale, our estimates
for the United States and China are comparable to the food
waste values provided in the literature.10,16
Third, our study highlights climate burdens associated with
food waste by estimating GHG emissions generated while
producing the wasted food. Our global emission estimate
related to food waste in 2005 of 410 Mt CO2eq/yr is lower than
the estimation of 560 Mt CO2eq/yr in 2007 by FAO.38 To be
precise, FAO38 calculated GHG emissions associated with both
food loss and waste considering on-farm energy use and
nonenergy-related emissions from crop and livestock. While we
assessed non-CO2 GHG emissions related to food waste only.
By comparing these estimates, it is clear that a larger share of
emissions is associated with food waste and non-CO2 GHGs.
Hence, reducing food waste is an important climate change
mitigation option within the food system.39
Fourth, this study highlights that there are the regions of the
world where food waste is prevalent and others where food
deficit is the mainstay. Food waste and deficit on a country
scale is also related to the development stage (HDI) of the
country. However, undernourishment may prevail in a country
with food surplus due to income inequality and poverty,
resulting in disparity in food security within the country. For
example, although our analysis shows that India currently has a
food surplus of 210 kcal/cap/day, it also has the second-highest
number of undernourished people in the world.33 Hence, the
problem of undernourishment and hidden hunger around the
globe is a distribution problem rather than a production one.40
In order to eliminate hunger, countries with food deficits at first
need to increase their food availability, while other countries
need to improve their food distribution systems. One of the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)41 is to eliminate
hunger of any kind by 2030, globally.
Similarly, another SDG targets halving per capita global
consumer level food waste by 2030.41 However, we find that
country level food waste increases with its HDI, which is a
trend opposite to the SDGs. Hence, this trend needs to be
reversed like CO2 emissions42 which follow a weak environ-
mental Kuznets curve,43 making development and reduced food
waste compatible.
Although our study provides clear findings, interpretation of
our results also requires a discussion on its limitations that
implied from the data sources and chosen methodology. On the
data side, FAOSTAT is criticized because of consistency,
completeness, and reliability issues. The national data that UN
population estimates rely upon suffer from errors due to under-
and overestimations. Yet, both data sets are the only global

 databases available. Additionally, these data are periodically
updated with revised methodologies to enhance data quality
and are widely used by the scientific community.
From a methodological perspective, our food requirement
calculations may include overestimates and underestimates
because we did not consider physiology and environmental
conditions that may additionally affect food requirements. After
all, it was not possible to account for these factors due to data
scarcity and methodological limitation. Most studies10,27,29
investigating food requirements accounted for body weight,
age, gender, and PAL as our study did. Additionally, our
analysis did not consider if and how the future food
requirement would be fulfilled.
We considered food surplus as a proxy for food waste.
However, food surplus may additionally contribute to over-
eating, resulting in an overweight and obese population.
Nevertheless, we compiled global body weight data for the
most recent years and, hence, accounted for overeating in the
past. Additionally, part of the food surplus may be used as
livestock feed, investigation of which is beyond the scope of our
current study. After all, the share of food waste on feed is
relatively low compared to the 40% of the total crop calories
that are currently fed to livestock.3 In addition, some regions,
e.g., European Union, prohibit the feeding of food waste to
livestock.44 Nonetheless, to use discarded food as feed could be
an option to tap into parts of wasted calories. Other options of
using the food waste would be to downcycle into biogas and
composting.
Last, our emission estimates include only non-CO2 GHGs
emitted during the food production. This study did not cover
CO2 emissions from on-farm and off-farm energy use (e.g.,
machinery, fertilizer production, transportation, etc.). Thus, we
underestimated the total GHG emissions mitigation potential
of food waste reduction. However, agriculture is a major source
of non-CO2 GHG emissions which is captured by our
approach. We did not consider different food commodities
while estimating the emissions because of challenges in
assigning food surplus to the food commodities. Additionally,
we are not aware of data on GHG emissions by food
commodities for a large number of countries. Nevertheless, our
study distinguished emission intensities based on crop and
animal products that have large variations in GHG emissions.12
Summing up, our study highlights the important challenge of
reducing food waste and its associated climate burdens.
Although physical food consumption has metabolic limits,
food availability across the globe is increasing with growing
incomes and advancing development. This is the case for many
countries, where the food supply chain does not reflect the
physical limits of calorie requirements, providing excess food
that results in waste and overconsumption. Hence, this
inefficiency in the food supply chain needs to be addressed45
to reduce agricultural related environmental consequences and
climate burdens. Addressing this challenge will also lower the
future food demand. Therefore, to feed around 9 billion people
by 2050, in addition to increasing food production (e.g., by
closing crop yield gaps46), the key underlying questions that
remain to be answered are how can we make the food supply
chain smarter and more efficient, and how can consumers be
convinced to reduce food waste.
