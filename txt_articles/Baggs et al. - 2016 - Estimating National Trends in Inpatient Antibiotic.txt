IMPORTANCE The rising threat of antibiotic resistance and other adverse consequences
resulting from the misuse of antibiotics requires a better understanding of antibiotic use in
hospitals in the United States.
OBJECTIVE To use proprietary administrative data to estimate patterns of US inpatient
antibiotic use in recent years.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS For this retrospective analysis, adult and pediatric
in-patient antibiotic use data was obtained from the Truven Health MarketScan Hospital Drug
Database (HDD) from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2012. Data from adult and pediatric
patients admitted to 1 of approximately 300 participating acute care hospitals provided
antibiotic use data for over 34 million discharges representing 166 million patient-days.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We retrospectively estimated the days of therapy (DOT)
per 1000 patient-days and the proportion of hospital discharges in which a patient received
at least 1 dose of an antibiotic during the hospital stay. We calculated measures of antibiotic
usage stratified by antibiotic class, year, and other patient and facility characteristics. We used
data submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Healthcare Cost Report
Information System to generate estimated weights to apply to the HDD data to create
national estimates of antibiotic usage. A multivariate general estimating equation model to
account for interhospital covariance was used to assess potential trends in antibiotic DOT
over time.
RESULTS During the years 2006 to 2012, 300 to 383 hospitals per year contributed antibiotic
data to the HDD. Across all years, 55.1% of patients received at least 1 dose of antibiotics
during their hospital visit. The overall national DOT was 755 per 1000 patient-days. Overall
antibiotic use did not change significantly over time. The multivariable trend analysis of data
from participating hospitals did not show a statistically significant change in overall use (total
DOT increase, 5.6; 95% CI, −18.9 to 30.1; P = .65). However, the mean change (95% CI) for the
following antibiotic classes increased significantly: third- and fourth-generation
cephalosporins, 10.3 (3.1-17.5); macrolides, 4.8 (2.0-7.6); glycopeptides, 22.4 (17.5-27.3);
β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, 18.0 (13.3-22.6); carbapenems, 7.4 (4.6-10.2);
and tetracyclines, 3.3 (2.0-4.7).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Overall DOT of all antibiotics among hospitalized patients in
US hospitals has not changed significantly in recent years. Use of some antibiotics, especially
broad spectrum agents, however, has increased significantly. This trend is worrisome in light
of the rising challenge of antibiotic resistance. Our findings can help inform national efforts to
improve antibiotic use by suggesting key targets for improvement interventions.

O

other consequences resulting from unnecessary an-
tibiotic use, ensuring appropriate antibiotic usage in
the United States has become a national priority.1-4 In re-
sponse, the US government has developed The National Strat-
egy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria.2,5 Antibiotic

AbetterunderstandingofantibioticuseinUShospitalscan
inform stewardship efforts by identifying targets for reduc-
ing inappropriate or unnecessary prescribing. Previous na-
tional surveys of antibiotic usage in acute care hospitals were
conductedin20023,7,8and20119bytheCDC.Furthermore,sev-
eral studies have capitalized on electronic or administrative
data from US hospitals to characterize antibiotic use.10-16 How-
ever,pasteffortshavebeenlimitedbydiversityinpatientpopu-
lationsandfacilitiesthatprecludednationalestimatesandpro-
vided limited longitudinal estimates. To address these gaps,
we used a proprietary administrative data set from a large and
diverse population of US hospitals to estimate patterns of in-
patient antibiotic use over several years and extrapolate these
findings to all US hospitals.
Methods
Adult and pediatric drug use data were obtained from the Tru-
ven Health MarketScan Hospital Drug Database (HDD). The
HDD contains hospital discharge records for all patients dis-
chargedfromparticipatingacutecare,general,nonfederalhos-
pitals in the United States. These records include discharge-
specific diagnostic and procedure codes, demographic
information, inpatient drug usage data based on billing rec-
ords, admission and discharge dates, and facility descriptors.
We included visits from contributing hospitals for patients dis-
charged from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2012, includ-
ing in-hospital deaths. For each discharge, we identified an-
tibiotic doses charged to the patient during the inpatient stay.
We searched the HDD for doses of any antibiotic listed in the
US Food and Drug Administration’
s National Drug Code
Directory17 or the World Health Organization’
s Anatomical
Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)/Defined Daily Dose (DDD) clas-
sification system.18 We eliminated antibiotics not adminis-
teredbyoral,parental,orinhalationroutes.Eachantibioticwas
categorized into 1 of 15 classes: aminoglycoside, first- and sec-
ond-generation cephalosporin, third- and fourth-generation
cephalosporin, lincosamide, fluoroquinolone, macrolide, gly-
copeptide, sulfonamide, β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor com-
bination, carbapenem, penicillin, tetracycline, metronida-
zole, and other antibacterial agents. We further eliminated
hospitals not submitting any antibiotic usage data within a
given year (2% of participating hospitals). This study did not
require review by an investigational review board as the HDD
contains no personally identifiable data, and the data use
agreement precluded any access by the investigators to such
identifiers; therefore, the analysis did not involve human
subjects.
We retrospectively estimated measures of antibiotic use
as both days of therapy per 1000 patient-days (DOT) and the
proportion of hospital discharges in which a patient received
at least 1 dose of an antibiotic during their stay. One DOT rep-
resents the administration of a single agent on a given day re-
gardless of the dosage strength or number of doses. For ex-
ample, administration of a single 1000-mg dose of cefazolin
or 3 1000-mg doses given 8 hours apart both constitute 1 DOT,
while a patient receiving doses of vancomycin and ceftazi-
dime would count as 2 DOTs.10 In addition to calculating over-
all usage measures, we stratified measures by antibiotic class,
year, or other patient and facility characteristics. All hospital
locations were included.
To create national estimates of inpatient antibiotic use, we
performed a weighted extrapolation of data from the subset
of US hospitals reporting to the HDD. We generated estimated
weights to apply to HDD data using data submitted to the Cen-
ters for Medicare and Medicaid Services Healthcare Cost Re-
port Information System (HCRIS). The HCRIS includes re-
ports submitted from all Medicare-certified US hospitals.19 We
used the HCRIS to determine the number of patient-days and
discharges among all US nonfederal acute care hospitals for
each year of the study. Furthermore, we stratified by bed size
(<300, ≥300), US census division, urban or rural status, and
teaching status. In a similar fashion, we determined the num-
ber of patient-days and discharges for each hospital partici-
pating in the HDD by year, stratified by the same characteris-
tics. To determine hospital-specific weights for the
extrapolation, we divided year-specific total patient-days or
dischargesineachoftheHCRISstratabythenumberofpatient-
days or discharges for each participating HDD hospital to gen-
erate a hospital-specific weight. There were 72 possible strata
based on these variables, but certain strata were combined due
to the small number of participating hospitals in the HDD. As
aresult,35stratawerecreatedtogenerateweights.FortheDOT
measure, weights based on patient-days were used and fur-
ther stratified by critical care days vs all other inpatient-days;
for the proportion of discharges during which an antibiotic was
used, weights based on discharges were used. Results are re-
ported as the weighted national estimates except where oth-
erwise noted.
Key Points
Question How much antibiotic use occurs in US hospitals, and has
the pattern of use changed over time?
Findings Overall rates of antibiotic use in US hospitals did not
change significantly from 2006 to 2012; however, use of certain
antibiotic classes, including glycopeptides, β-lactam/β-lactamase
inhibitor combinations, and carbapenems, increased significantly.
Meaning Patterns of antibiotic use in US hospitals may have
important implications for reducing antibiotic-resistant infections;
these findings can help inform national efforts to improve
antibiotic use by suggesting key targets for improvement.

To validate the extrapolated national estimates, we com-
pared our national estimates based on the HDD with indepen-
dent national estimates derived from the Healthcare Cost and
Utilization Project (HCUP) Nationwide Inpatient Sample
(Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Rockville, Mary-
land; http://hcupnet.ahrq.gov/). Specifically, we compared re-
sults from our extrapolated national estimates with those of
the HCUP with regard to the following: number of annual in-
patient discharges and inpatient-days, the mean and median
length of stay (LOS), age and sex distribution of discharged pa-
tients, payer distribution, distribution of certain common di-
agnostic and procedure codes, and proportion of inpatient
deaths. Comparisons were limited to nonfederal hospitals in
the HCUP because our weights were based on nonfederal hos-
pitals and to the year 2012 for this report.
To assess potential trends in antibiotic use over time, we
developed a multivariate model using linear regression based
on the approximately normal distribution of the outcome. Our
model used generalized estimating equations (GEE) to ac-
count for interhospital covariance. Our outcome was DOT per
1000 patient-days for each facility and used facility weights
as described previously. Our main variable of interest was cal-
endaryear,andweincludedfacilitycharacteristicssuchascase
mix index, average age, bed size category, teaching status, fa-
cility urban or rural location, proportion of surgical dis-
charges, average comorbidity score for the facility,20 and fa-
cility geographic location as determined by US census division.
Furthermore, we used revenue codes to identify days in which
patientsreceivedcarefromintensivecareunits;forthosedays,
antibiotic usage was attributed to a critical care location. For
all other patient-days, antibiotic usage was attributed to a non-
critical care location. We also included in the model the pro-
portion of inpatient-days in which the primary International
ClassificationofDiseases,NinthRevision,ClinicalModification21
diagnosis code for that admission was related to an infection,
whichwepreviouslyfoundtobeanimportantpredictorofhos-
pital antibiotic usage.22 To examine possible region-specific
and age-specific trends, we included interaction terms be-
tween calendar year and census division or age category in-
stead of average age.
All data were analyzed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Insti-
tute Inc).
Results
From January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2012, data on over 34
million discharges representing 166 million patient-days from
552 hospitals were included in the study. Over the 7 years, the
number of hospitals contributing data for a given year ranged
from 300 to 383 (Table 1). The proportion of hospitals varied by
geographic location, with the largest number of hospitals par-
ticipating in the South Atlantic region (29%) and the lowest in
the New England region (3%); a distribution that was slightly
but significantly different than that of all US hospitals. Hospi-
tals were generally larger and more frequent in urban areas.
National estimates from our analysis were compared with
those from the HCUP (Table 2). While patient-days and dis-
charges among reporting hospitals decreased over time, the
weighted national estimates of total patient-days and dis-
chargesweresimilartothosefromtheHCUPacrossstudyyears,
differing by −0.7% to 5.6% for any given year. In addition, our
extrapolated estimates were similar to the HCUP estimates for
median LOS, sex distribution, age categories, distribution of
common diagnostic and procedure codes, and proportion of
inpatient stays resulting in death. Estimates of the propor-
tion of discharges with a private source primary payer was
higher than the HCUP (38.8% vs 31.5%).
Overall,55.1%ofpatientsdischargedreceivedatleast1dose
of an antibiotic during their hospital visit. The overall rate of
antibiotic use for all study years was 755 per 1000 patient-
days (Table 3). Both the proportion of discharges during which
an antibiotic was received and the DOT per 1000 patient-
days varied by antibiotic class. Days of therapy per 1000 pa-
tient-dayswerehighestforfluoroquinolones,third-andfourth-
generationcephalosporins,andβ-lactam/β-lactamaseinhibitor
combinations. The proportion of discharges in which an an-
tibiotic was given during the hospital visit was highest for first-
and second-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and
third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins.
The multivariable trend analysis of data from participat-
ing hospitals did not show a statistically significant change in
overall use (total DOT increase, 5.6; 95% CI, −18.9 to 30.1;
P = .65). Temporal trends varied by antibiotic class (Figure 1).
Estimates of usage decreased for aminoglycosides, first and
second generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, sulfa,
metronidazole (P < .001 for preceding medications), and peni-
cillins (P = .01) with the greatest decrease among fluoroqui-
nolones. Macrolides, third- and fourth-generation cephalo-
sporins, glycopeptides, β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor
combinations, carbapenems, tetracyclines, and other types of
antibacterials all increased (P < .001 for all except third- and
fourth-generation cephalosporins [P = .001]).
Usage of antibiotics was about 52% greater in critical care
locations (1092 vs 720 DOT per 1000 patient-days) (Table 3)
compared with noncritical care locations (P < .001) but not
consistently for every class. Usage was significantly greater in
critical care locations for aminoglycoside, third- and fourth-
generation cephalosporin, glycopeptide, β-lactam/β-
lactamase inhibitor combination, carbapenem, penicillin,
metronidazole, and other types of antibacterials (eFigure 1 in
the Supplement).
Antibiotic usage varied by geographic location of the hos-
pital even after controlling for various facility characteristics
in the multivariable model (P < .001) (Figure 2). Divisions in
the Southeast Central, Northeast Central, Southwest Central,
and Mountain areas of the United States had the highest DOT
per 1000 patient-days overall, while divisions in the New
England, Mid Atlantic, and Pacific had the lowest. Trends in
usage over time did not vary significantly by geographic region
(P = .25).
Antibioticusagedidnotvarysignificantlybyfacilitybedsize
(P = .17) or urban or rural location (P = .34). Based on our GEE
model, hospitals identified as nonteaching had slightly higher
DOT per 1000 patient-days compared with teaching hospitals
(P = .004). Similarly hospitals denoted as large urban teaching

hospitals had a lower but not significantly different DOT per
1000 patient-days compared with other hospitals (P = .16).
Antibiotic usage varied by age group. Usage was lowest for
those younger than 18 years and highest for those 45 years and
older. Among the youngest age group, aminoglycosides, third-
and fourth-generation cephalosporin, and penicillin were the
most commonly used antibiotics, while the most commonly
used classes for older age groups were third- and fourth-
generationcephalosporin,fluoroquinolones,glycopeptide,and
β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations. The distribu-
tion of usage by age group was consistent among census divi-
sions, and usage over time did not vary significantly by age
group in GEE models (P = .12).
Discussion
Our study is the first, to our knowledge, to provide national
estimates of temporal trends in antibiotic use among US hos-
pitals. These observations build upon previous studies, in-
cluding those from a recent national point-prevalence survey
of inpatient antibiotic use,9 by demonstrating important
changes in use over time and quantifying days of antibiotic
therapy. While overall rates of antibiotic use in US hospitals did
not change significantly from 2006 to 2012, we identified im-
portant trends within individual antibiotic classes. There were
significant decreases in fluoroquinolones (20%) and first- and
second-generation cephalosporins (7%) usage, but these de-
creases were offset by significant increases in vancomycin
(32%) and agents with broad-spectrum activity against gram-
negative bacteria, including carbapenem (37%), third- and
fourth-generation cephalosporin (12%), and β-lactam/β-
lactamaseinhibitorcombinationantibiotics(26%).Despitesub-
stantial reduction in fluoroquinolone use, this class re-
mained the most commonly used antibiotic class in US
hospitals in 2012 (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
We can only hypothesize why we observed certain antibi-
otic class-specific trends. For instance, the decrease in fluoro-
quinolone use may be related to Clostridium difficile infection
prevention efforts23 or changes to empirical therapy due to the
emergenceofwidespreadresistancetofluoroquinolonesamong
several clinically important bacteria.24 Increases in third- and
fourth-generation cephalosporin, β-lactam/β-lactamase in-
hibitor combination, and carbapenem antibiotics may reflect

increasing concern about infections caused by antibiotic-
resistant gram-negative bacteria. Likewise, increases in glyco-
peptide use, mainly vancomycin, may reflect a response to the
emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as a
common cause of community-acquired skin and soft tissue
infections.25,26
The current distribution of inpatient antibiotic use by an-
tibiotic class in the United States appears to differ consider-
ably in comparison to the United Kingdom and France. For ex-
ample, in 2012, 47% of total inpatient use in the United States
was accounted for by 4 classes: third- and fourth-generation
cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, carbapenem, and glycopep-
tide. In contrast, these 4 classes accounted for only 11% of in-
patient use in the United Kingdom from 2012 to 201327 and for
27%, an estimate including all cephalosporins, in France in
2007.28 Similarly, penicillin antibiotics account for 30% of in-
patient use in the United Kingdom27 and 21% in France28 but
only 4% in US hospitals. It is possible that differences in preva-
lence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens observed in these coun-
tries, which tend to be lower than the United States, could be,
in part, attributable to different patterns of antibiotic use, al-
though other factors, such as different infection control prac-
tices or patient movement patterns may also play a role.25,29
Between 2005 and 2009, the United Kingdom observed dra-
matic reductions in C difficile infection, which is hypoth-
esized to be attributable to replacing a large proportion of fluo-
roquinolone and cephalosporin use with antibiotics such as
penicillin that may be less likely to result in C difficile over-
growth. Overall rates of antibiotic use in the United Kingdom
did not change during this time period.30,31 While the opti-
mal distribution of antibiotic use by class is unknown, the
United Kingdom’
s experience suggests a similar shift in dis-
tribution might be beneficial for US patients. Such a change is
likely feasible given that approximately 50% of inpatient an-
tibiotic use in US hospitals is for treatment of lower respira-
tory and urinary tract infections9 and that inpatient prescrib-
ing for these and other infections is often inappropriate.2,32
While current treatment guidelines for lower respiratory tract
infections include fluoroquinolones or cephalosporins, non-
fluoroquinolone and noncephalosporin regimens are also rec-
ommended as first-line therapy.33 Enhanced efforts to im-
prove diagnosis of urinary tract infections could lead to deep
reductions in unnecessary antibiotic use directed at urinary
tract infections that are commonly treated with third-
generationcephalosporinorfluoroquinoloneantibiotics.Ashift
away from inpatient fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin use
may have major implications for prevention of C difficile in-
fections in the United States, especially because use of these
2 categories of antibiotics was particularly common among
older patients at the highest risk of severe outcomes from C
difficile infections.
Our study had a number of strengths. Of studies estimat-
inginpatientantibioticuseintheUnitedStates,oursisthelarg-
esttodatethatweknowof,containinginformationfromatleast
300hospitalseachyear,representingadiversityofsizes,teach-
ing status, and urban or rural locations in each geographic di-
vision. In addition, our study contained data across several
years allowing for trend analysis. Even though our sample of
hospitals contained a wider variety of hospital types, our point
estimates were consistent with results from past studies with
regard to overall and class-specific use.9-11,15 Detailed data con-
tained information on a range of hospital and patient-specific
demographic and clinical characteristics, allowing for this in-
formation to be included in multivariate models. Further-
more, we used data from the HCRIS to develop weighting in-
formation to extrapolate our estimates to the national level.
Since nonweighted estimates were similar to those produced
by our extrapolation, we believe the sample of hospitals par-
ticipating in the HDD may represent a national sample. When
we validated our national estimates from the HDD with inde-
pendentnationalestimatesderivedfromtheHCUP,thosemea-
sures matched well.

Limitations
This study has certain limitations. Administrative data are col-
lected primarily for billing purposes and adapted for research.
There is likely misclassification in pharmacy, clinical, and facil-
ity information; however, this bias is most likely nondifferen-
tial.Furthermore,administrativedatahasbeenshowntobeuse-
ful in other areas of health care research.34-38 Use of pharmacy
charge data to estimate medication usage in hospitals was pre-
viously validated in a small sample with excellent agreement11
andmorerecentlyinasmallgroupofpediatrichospitals.39When
limited to hospitals submitting data for at least 5 years of the
study period, our analysis found similar trends in the multivar-
iateanalyses.Likewise,somegeographicregionsareoverorun-
der represented by the distribution of hospitals in this sample
compared with the US distribution of hospitals. We sought to
overcome this through regional adjustment of estimates using
nationally representative data from the HCRIS; however, the
smallnumberofhospitalsinsomeregionsmaystilllimitthere-
liability of the estimates. Furthermore, our extrapolated esti-
mates were limited to acute, nonfederal hospitals in the United
States and do not adequately represent children’
s hospitals,
whichrepresentlessthan1%ofincludedhospitals.Nonetheless,
we were encouraged to find that in aggregate, our national es-
timatesappearquiteconsistentwithotherstudies.Finally,due
to changes in the data source, we were unable to generate na-
tional estimates after 2012; however, we do not believe major
changes in antibiotic use in acute care hospitals have occurred.
Inasensitivityanalysisincludingasampleof137hospitalswith
data through 2014, we observed similar trends. Unfortunately,
the hospitals available for this analysis were not representative
oftheentiresamplebecausenotallgeographicregionswererep-
resented in this limited sample of hospitals.
Conclusions
Overall rates of antibiotic use in US hospitals did not change
significantly from 2006 to 2012. However, we identified sig-
nificant changes in specific antibiotic classes and regional

Across all hospitals, the change in mean DOT per 1000 patient-days were
estimated by generalized estimating equation models controlling for case mix

facility location, proportion of surgical discharges, average comorbidity score,
facility geographic location, critical care setting, and proportion of
inpatient-days in which the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision, Clinical Modification21 diagnosis code was related to an infection. Data
points represent mean DOT per 1000 patient-days for each antibiotic class, and
the whiskers represent 95% CIs. DOT indicates days of therapy.

variation that may have important implications for reducing
antibiotic-resistant infections. Improved monitoring of antibi-
otic use is critical to direct the work of antibiotic stewardship
programs in the United States. In 2012, the CDC launched the
AntibioticUseOptionoftheNationalHealthcareSafetyNetwork
that provides real-time monitoring of antibiotics administered
inUShospitals.Asenrollmentintheantibioticuseoptiongrows,
it will provide ongoing systematic assessment at the hospital,
state, regional, and national levels. Because inappropriate an-
tibiotic use increases the risk of antibiotic resistance and other
adverse patient outcomes,2 continued monitoring of antibiotic
use is critical to future improvements in patient safety.
