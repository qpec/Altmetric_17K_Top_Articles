Glaucoma is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease and a leading cause of blindness
worldwide. The mechanisms causing glaucomatous neurodegeneration are not fully under-
stood. Here we show, using mice deficient in T and/or B cells and adoptive cell transfer, that
transient elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) is sufficient to induce T-cell infiltration into
the retina. This T-cell infiltration leads to a prolonged phase of retinal ganglion cell degen-
eration that persists after IOP returns to a normal level. Heat shock proteins (HSP) are
identified as target antigens of T-cell responses in glaucomatous mice and human glaucoma
patients. Furthermore, retina-infiltrating T cells cross-react with human and bacterial HSPs;
mice raised in the absence of commensal microflora do not develop glaucomatous T-cell
responses or the associated neurodegeneration. These results provide compelling evidence
that glaucomatous neurodegeneration is mediated in part by T cells that are pre-sensitized by
exposure to commensal microflora.

laucoma affects 70 million people worldwide1, making it
the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease and a
leading cause of irreversible blindness. The disease is
characterized by progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells
(RGCs) and axons. The most important risk factor for glaucoma
is elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), which is thought to directly
cause damage to neurons and the optic nerve. However, glauco-
matous RGC and axon loss also occur in individuals with normal
IOP, and patients whose IOP is effectively controlled by medical
treatment often continue to suffer progressive neuron loss and
visual field deterioration2,3, suggesting mechanisms beyond
pressure-mediated damage in neurodegeneration. One possibility
is that pathophysiological stress, such as that induced by elevated
IOP, triggers secondary immune or autoimmune responses,
leading to RGC and axon damage after the initial insult is gone.
To date, this remains as a hypothesis, as the molecular and cel-
lular events underlying glaucomatous neural damage have not
been identified.
Evidence suggests an autoimmune component in glaucoma4.
Among the most direct evidence, a wide range of serum auto-
antibodies particularly those against heat shock proteins (HSPs)
and retinal deposits of immunoglobulins, were found in glaucoma
patients and animal models of glaucoma5,6. Moreover, inocula-
tion of rats with human HSP27 and HSP60 induced an optic
neuropathy that resembles glaucomatous neural damage7, and
elevated IOP has been reported to induce expression of HSPs in
the retina, particularly RGCs8,9. Thus, a link among IOP eleva-
tion, HSP upregulation, and induction of anti-HSP autoimmune
responses in glaucoma has been suggested; however, the roles of
these events in the disease pathogenesis remain unknown.
Because the eye is an immune-privileged site, a critical question
is how autoimmune responses, such as those against HSPs, are
induced in glaucoma. As HSPs are among the most highly con-
served proteins from bacteria to mice to humans (up to 60%
identity)10, a possibility is that the anti-HSP immune responses
are induced originally by bacterial HSPs, and are reactivated by
host HSPs during glaucoma. The facts that glaucoma patients
exhibit increased titers of antibodies against Helicobacter pylori
and that immunization with HSPs in rats induces glaucomatous
neural damage are in line with this possibility11. Currently, little
direct evidence is available to testify this hypothesis.
Here we show that: (1) a transient elevation of IOP is sufficient
to induce CD4+ T-cell infiltration into the retina; (2) T-cell
responses are essential in the development of progressive glau-
comatous neurodegeneration following IOP elevation; (3) both
bacterial and human HSPs are target antigens of these T cells; and
(4) HSP-specific CD4+ T-cell responses and glaucomatous neu-
rodegeneration are both abolished in mice raised in the absence of
commensal microbial flora (germ-free (GF) mice), supporting a
mechanism of bacteria sensitized T-cell responses underlying the
pathogenesis of glaucoma. These observations identify a sequence
of events that contribute to progressive neurodegeneration in
glaucoma, and may lead to a paradigm shift for the diagnosis,
prevention, and treatment of glaucoma.
Results
Elevation of IOP induces retinal T-cell infiltration. To inves-
tigate if a high IOP evokes retinal immune responses, we induced
IOP elevation in mice by microbead (MB) injection. As shown
previously12, a single MB injection into the anterior chamber of
adult C57BL/6 (B6) mice led to a transient 3-week elevation of
IOP (Fig. 1a), whereas injection of saline did not induce any
significant change in IOP (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Using
immunostaining of retinal flat-mounts for general T-cell marker
CD3 and RGC marker Tuj1, we detected T-cell infiltration into
the ganglion cell layer (GCL) of MB-injected, but not of unin-
jected or saline-injected mice (Fig. 1b). Infiltrating T cells were
noted at 2 weeks after MB injection (Fig. 1c), scattered
throughout the retina without apparent clustering or preference
to any specific quadrant. The number of T cells had declined by
4 weeks. To define the subpopulations of infiltrating T cells, we
performed triple-immunolabeling with antibodies specific for
CD4 or CD8 T cells, RECA1 (for blood vessels), and Tuj1. CD4+,
but not CD8+, T cells were detected in the GCL of glaucomatous
retina (Supplementary Fig. 1b). To verify T-cell retinal infiltration
and define the subsets of CD4+ T cells, we examined T-cell
cytokine secretion profiles, including interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (TH1),
intereukin (IL)-17 (TH17), IL-4 (TH2), and transforming growth
factor-β (TGF-β) (Treg). We detected IFN-γ secreting, but no
other subsets of, CD4+ T cells in the retina. The number of
infiltrating CD4+ T cells was significantly increased in MB-
injected retina compared to saline-injected controls (Fig. 1d, e).
As with T-cell infiltration, significantly more CD11b+ microglia
and macrophages were detected in the retinas of mice 2–4 weeks
after MB, but not after saline injection (Fig. 1f, g). These immune
responses were a result of the elevated IOP because injection of
fewer MB (2.0 × 106 beads/eye), which did not elevate IOP,
induced neither T-cell infiltration (Fig. 1h) nor an increase in
CD11b+ cells (Supplementary Fig. 1c) in the retina compared to
saline-injected group. In contrast, correlating with IOP elevation,
injection of more MB (5.0 × 106 beads/eye) induced both T-cell
infiltration (Fig. 1h) and an increase in CD11b+ cells (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1c). Induction of immune responses by elevated IOP
was also confirmed using DBA/2J mice, which spontaneously
develop increased IOP and glaucoma by 6–8 months of age13
(Supplementary Fig. 1d, e). T-cell infiltration was detected in the
retinas of 8-month-old DBA/2J mice, but not in 3-month-old
mice (Fig. 1c). No B-cell infiltration was detected in the retinas in
either MB-injected B6 mice or 8-month-old DBA/2J mice. Thus,
elevation of IOP is followed by T-cell infiltration into the retinas.
To assess retinal neurodegeneration, we quantified RGC and
axon loss in mice. As shown by RGC quantification with Tuj1
labeling, percentages of RGC and axon losses gradually increased
from ~17% at 2 weeks post MB injection to ~35% by 8 weeks
(Fig. 1i–k). Accordingly, RGC densities decreased significantly
from ~3800 mm−2 in saline-injected mice to ~3300 mm−2 at
2 weeks after MB injection, and to ~2500 mm−2 at 8 weeks after
MB injection. This result was further verified by immunolabeling
for Brn3a (Supplementary Fig. 1f,g). Notably, although elevation
of IOP lasted only transiently for 3 weeks in the MB-injected
mice, RGC and axon loss continued to 8 weeks after MB
injection, the longest time point that the mice were monitored.
These results show that a transient elevation of IOP induces T-
cell infiltration into the retina and a prolonged period of retinal
neurodegeneration, even after the IOP has returned to the normal
level.
T cells mediate prolonged retinal neurodegeneration. To
determine the role of T cells in elevated IOP-induced retinal
neurodegeneration, we used mice deficient in both T and B cells
(Rag1−/− mice), only T cells (TCRβ−/− mice), or only B cells
(Igh6−/− mice)14–16. Injection of MB into these immune-deficient
mice resulted in a transient elevation of IOP that had the same
magnitude and kinetics as that observed in B6 mice (Supple-
mentary Fig. 2a) and a similar loss of RGCs and axons at 2 weeks
as seen in B6 mice (Fig. 2a, b). However, glaucomatous Rag1−/−
mice did not exhibit continued loss of RGCs or axons from 2 to
8 weeks post MB injection when IOP had returned to the normal
range, whereas B6 and Igh6−/− mice did. In TCRβ−/− mice,
which lack CD4+ αβT cells but are compensated by expansion of

 γδ and natural killer T cells and B cells, no significant further loss
of RGCs was detected between 2 and 8 weeks after MB injection;
whereas, an attenuated albeit significant loss of axons was
observed at 8 weeks. The data suggest a primary role for CD4+
αβT cells, with a possible involvement of other immune cells, in
late glaucomatous axon damage. These findings support a two-
phase neurodegeneration in glaucoma: the initial phase when IOP
is elevated and the prolonged (progressive) phase after IOP has
returned to the normal range. Neither T- nor B-cell deficiency
attenuates the initial phase of neural damage, but T cells are an
essential player in the prolonged phase of glaucomatous RGC and
axon degeneration.
To further define the subsets of systemic CD4+ T cells that were
activated under elevated IOP, we examined cytokine secretion
profiles of CD4+ T cells in the spleens and eye draining (cervical)
lymph nodes (LNs) by flow cytometry. Unlike that seen in the retina,
the frequencies of CD4+ T cells that expressed IFN-γ (TH1), IL-17
(TH17), IL-4 (TH2), or TGF-β (Treg) were all significantly increased
in both the spleen and the cervical LN of mice at 2 weeks post MB
injection compared to saline-injected mice (Supplementary Fig. 2b,
c). Thus, elevated IOP induced enhanced systemic reactivity of
T cells, without any bias toward a specific subset of CD4+ T cells.

 transferring T cells from glaucomatous B6 mice into Rag1−/−
mice. As all subtypes of CD4+ T cells were activated following
IOP elevation, total CD4+ T-cell populations from the spleens of
B6 mice, which had received MB (glaucomatous) injection
14 days earlier, were transferred; CD4+ T cells isolated from
naive or saline-injected mice served as controls. Cells were
injected via the tail vein into Rag1−/− mice that had received MB
injection 14 days earlier (on the same day when the donor mice
had received MB injections) (Fig. 2c). Two weeks after CD4+ T-
cell transfer (or 4 weeks after MB injection), MB-injected Rag1
−/− recipients, which had not received any CD4+ T-cell transfer
(U) or that received CD4+ T cells from saline-injected (S) normal
IOP B6 mice showed no retinal T-cell infiltration (Fig. 2d, f). As
expected, these Rag1−/− mice exhibited ~15% RGC and axon loss
as a result of the elevated IOP-induced initial phase of neural
damage (Fig. 2g, h). In contrast, MB-injected Rag1−/− recipients
that had received a CD4+ T-cell transfer from glaucomatous
(MB-injected) B6 mice showed retinal T-cell infiltration (Fig. 2f)
and a significant further increase in RGC and axon loss compared
to the uninjected (U) and saline-injected (S) control mice
(Fig. 2d–h). Induction of IOP elevation in recipient mice was
required for T-cell transfer-induced neurodegeneration because
injection of T cells from glaucomatous mice into Rag1−/− mice
with normal IOP did not cause further RGC and axon
degeneration after week 2 (Supplementary Fig. 2d, e). Injection
of total IgG from the MB-injected B6 mice induced no significant
increase in RGC and axon loss in MB-injected Rag1−/− mice
(Supplementary Fig. 2f, g). These results indicate that conditioned
CD4+ T cells are sufficient to drive the prolonged phase of retinal
neurodegeneration in glaucomatous mice.
IOP elevation activates T-cell responses to HSPs. To define the
autoantigens that stimulate T-cell activation in glaucoma, we
searched for proteins that are expressed or upregulated in RGCs
following IOP elevation. Since autoantibodies to HSPs, particu-
larly HSP27 and HSP60, had previously been detected in patients
and animal models of glaucoma8,17, we speculated that these
HSPs are involved as pathogenic autoantigens, which may be
expressed at a low level under the normal condition but are
upregulated in RGCs under glaucoma. The levels of HSP27 and
HSP60 proteins were low in the retinas of B6 mice with normal
IOP, but were upregulated three- to fourfold 1–8 weeks after MB
injection (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Fig. 3a–c). HSP27 upregulation
was found primarily in the GCL (Supplementary Fig. 2h), both
associated with RGC membranes and outside of RGC bodies
(Fig. 3b). This is consistent with the report that HSP27 is also
upregulated in astrocytes following elevated IOP and be released
extracellularly under stress18,19. HSP60 signal was seen to be
scattered between the GCL and INL in MB-injected retina
(Supplementary Fig. 3d). Significantly higher levels of anti-HSPs,
particularly anti-HSP27 autoantibody, were detected in the sera of
MB-injected B6 mice than in the serum of normal IOP mice
(Fig. 3c).
To test if HSP27 acts as an antigen participating in elevated
IOP-induced T-cell responses, we assessed delayed-type hyper-
sensitivity (DTH) responses in mice. Significant induction of a
HSP27-specific DTH was observed 2 and 8 weeks after MB
injection in B6 mice when compared to saline-injected mice
(Fig. 3d, e). More CD4+ T-cell infiltration was detected in the ear
sections
of
MB-injected
than
in
saline-injected
B6
mice
(Supplementary Fig. 4a). In agreement with the absence of
elevated IOP-induced T-cell responses in Rag1−/− and TCRβ−/−
mice, HSP27-specific DTH was not evoked in these mice (Fig. 3d).
The DTH response was specific to HSP27 because challenge with
control antigens, such as human myelin basic protein (MBP) or
interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), did not
induce a DTH in MB-injected B6 mice. Induction of HSP27-
specific T-cell responses by elevated IOP was also verified using
an
enzyme-linked
immunospot
(ELISPOT)
assay:
HSP27 stimulation of splenocytes from mice at 2 and 8 weeks
after MB injection induced a ~10 times higher frequency of IFN-
γ-secreting T cells than the splenocytes of saline-injected B6 mice;
in contrast, the frequencies of IFN-γ-secreting T cells in MB-
injected Rag1−/− and TCRβ−/− mice were comparable with those
of saline-injected B6 mice (Fig. 3f). Stimulation with control
antigen MBP did not increase the frequency of IFN-γ-secreting
T cells, further corroborating an induction of HSP27-specific T-
cell responses. These T-cell responses were induced by elevated
IOP, but not by the presence of MBs, as injection of fewer MB,
which did not cause IOP elevation did not lead to an increased
frequency in IFN-γ-secreting cells (Supplementary Fig. 4b).
Moreover, a similar increase in the frequencies of IFN-γ-
secreting T cells was observed in splenocytes taken from 10-
month-old DBA/2J mice compared to those from 3-month-old
DBA/2J mice or age-matched (10-month-old) control B6 mice
(Supplementary Fig. 4c). Thus, elevated IOP-induced T-cell
responses are specific to HSPs.
HSP-specific T cells augment glaucomatous neurodegenera-
tion. To examine if HSP27-specific IFN-γ-secreting T cells
infiltrate the retina and contribute to glaucomatous pathogenesis,
we performed fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis for
HSP27-stimulated retinal cell cultures following a gating strategy
shown in Supplementary Fig. 5. At 2 weeks post MB injection,

 ~1000 CD4+ T cells were noted in a glaucomatous mouse retina
(Fig. 1e). Supporting retinal infiltration of HSP27-specific IFN-γ-
secreting T cells, HSP27 stimulation induced an approximately
threefold higher frequency of IFN-γ+CD4+ T cells from the
retinal cultures of B6 mice than from saline-injected mice (Fig. 4a,
b; Supplementary Fig. 5); whereas, the other three subtypes of
CD4+ T cells (TH2, TH17, and Treg) were not detectable. Results
of quantitative PCR also detected the induction of IFN-γ
expression, but a lack of TGF-β, IL-17, and IL-4 transcripts, in
the glaucomatous retinas at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after MB injection
(Fig. 4c). To corroborate the above finding, GFP transgenic mice
were immunized with HSP27 or ovalbumin (OVA), and CD4+
T cells from immunized mice were adoptively transferred into
glaucomatous Rag1−/− mice (which had received an MB injection
2 weeks earlier). Approximately 15-fold more GFP+ T cells were
detected in the retinas of recipient Rag1−/− mice after T-cell
transfer from HSP27- than OVA-immunized donors (Fig. 4d),
further demonstrating HSP27-specific T-cell infiltration into the
glaucomatous retinas.
We then tested if HSP27-specific T cells can induce progressive
glaucomatous neural damage. B6 mice were immunized with
HSP27 or OVA. Successful immunization was confirmed by DTH
and ELISPOT assays (Fig. 4e, f). CD4+ T cells were then isolated
from spleens of the immunized or unimmunized mice and
adoptively transferred into glaucomatous B6 mice (injected with
MB 2 weeks earlier). Recipient B6 mice that received CD4+
T cells from the HSP27-immunized mice exhibited a significantly
greater loss of RGCs and axons compared to mice that received

 T cells from unimmunized or OVA-immunized mice (Fig. 4g).
Thus, HSP27-specific CD4+ T cells mediate the prolonged phase
of RGC and axon degeneration.
Absence of glaucomatous neural damage in GF mice. A key
remaining question here is how T-cell responses to HSPs are
induced by elevated IOP, especially given that the retina is an
immune-privileged site. HSPs are highly conserved from bacteria
to mice to humans20,21; mice and humans are exposed to com-
mensal microflora after birth and occasionally are infected by
pathogenic bacteria. We hypothesized that mice harbor memory
T cells to bacterial HSPs that can be activated by host HSPs
through molecular mimicry when the blood-retinal barrier is
compromised by elevated IOP. If this is the case, we expected that
T cells from glaucomatous mice would react to both bacterial and
human HSPs. Indeed, following stimulation with either human
HSP27 and HSP60 or Escherichia coli HSP24 and HSP60, we
observed similar increases in the frequencies of IFN-γ-secreting
cells in splenocyte cultures of MB-injected mice as compared to
saline-injected mice (Fig. 5a).
We reasoned that mice raised in the absence of microbial
colonization would exhibit attenuated or absent HSP-specific T-
cell responses and retinal neurodegeneration following IOP
elevation. We therefore examined T-cell responses and glauco-
matous neurodegeneration in GF Swiss Webster mice, which
were readily available from a commercial source. Anterior
chamber injection of MB in GF Swiss Webster mice induced
IOP elevation with similar kinetics and magnitude to con-
ventionally
colonized
(specific
pathogen-free
[SPF])
Swiss
Webster mice (Supplementary Fig. 6a). HSP27 upregulation in
the GCL of both SPF and GF mice following IOP elevation was
verified by immunolabeling, but no apparent differences between
the SPF and GF groups, before or after IOP elevation, were noted
(Supplementary Fig. 6b). Elevated IOP-induced retinal T-cell
infiltration (Fig. 5b) and HSP27- and HSP60-specific T-cell
responses (Fig. 5c, d) were detected in MB-injected SPF but not in
GF mice. Correspondingly, glaucomatous RGC and axon damage
was observed in SPF but not in GF mice, when examined either 4
or 8 weeks following MB injection (Fig. 5e, f). We then examined
“altered Schaedler flora” (ASF) Swiss Webster mice, which were
colonized with eight defined bacterial species22. We noted
significant RGC and axon loss following MB injection in ASF
mice, although the magnitude of loss was significantly attenuated
compared to MB-injected SPF mice (Fig. 5e, f). These results
suggest that induction of a full spectrum of HSP-specific T-cell
responses and retinal neurodegeneration requires pre-exposure to
diverse microbial flora, rather than a specific bacterial species.
To verify the above finding using the inherited mouse model of
glaucoma, we derived/created GF DBA/2J mice. DBA/2J mice
housed under SPF or GF conditions both naturally developed
high IOP with a peak of ~22 mm Hg by 8–10 months of age
(Supplementary Fig. 6c), consistent with previous reports23. The
SPF DBA/2J mice underwent the expected progressive RGC and
axon loss: ~25% by 8–10 months and ~50% by 12 months of age,
whereas no neural loss was detected in GF DBA/2J mice as late as
12 months of age (Supplementary Fig. 6d; Fig. 5g, h). In
agreement with the above finding, both RGC and axon counts
remained stable from 3 to 12 months of age, showing the absence
of neurodegeneration in GF DBA/2J mice. Collectively, these
results indicate a need for prior exposure to commensal microbial
flora in the induction of both HSP-specific T-cell responses as
well as RGC and axon loss following IOP elevation.
HSP-specific T cells are increased in patients with glaucoma.
To investigate the possible involvement of HSP-specific T-cell
responses in human glaucoma, we compared the frequencies of
HSP27- and HSP60-specific T cells and the levels of auto-
antibodies between normal subjects and patients with primary
open-angle glaucoma (POAG) or normal tension glaucoma
(NTG). The frequencies of HSP27- and HSP60-responsive T cells
were over fivefold higher in both POAG and NTG patients than
in age-matched healthy individuals (Fig. 6a, b). Patients with
retinal detachment or traumatic skin injuries did not have any
significant increase in HSP27- or HSP60-reactive T cells. In
addition, the titers of HSP27- and HSP60-specific IgGs were
approximately twofold higher in both POAG and NTG patients
than in healthy individuals (Fig. 6c, d), which was consistent with
a previous report24. Thus, the levels of HSP27- and HSP60-
reactive T cells and antibodies are also elevated in patients with
POAG and NTG.
Discussion
This is the first report that, to our knowledge, describes an
unexpected link and the sequential roles of elevated IOP, intact
commensal microflora, and activation of T-cell responses in the
pathogenesis of glaucoma. Our comprehensive studies employed
both inducible and genetic mouse models of glaucoma, immu-
nodeficient mice, GF mice, clinical samples, and adoptive T-cell
transfer, and assessed T-cell infiltration and retinal neurodegen-
eration. We showed that (1) a transient elevation of IOP by MB
injection is sufficient to induce T-cell infiltration into the retina
and a prolonged phase of retinal neurodegeneration, (2) T cells
are required for mediating the prolonged retinal neurodegen-
eration and are specific for HSPs, and (3) induction of HSP-
specific T cells and glaucomatous retinal neurodegeneration by
elevated IOP require exposure to commensal microflora. Toge-
ther, these findings are compelling as they suggest the essential
involvement of a T-cell-mediated mechanism in the pathogenesis
of glaucoma. A similar mechanism likely operates during the
development of glaucoma in humans as HSP-specific T cells are
more than fivefold higher in POAG and NTG patients than age-
matched healthy individuals.
Our study is the first demonstration of direct induction of
HSP-specific T-cell responses by an elevation of IOP. HSP-
specific T-cell responses have been proposed to contribute to
NTG as HSP immunization elicits glaucomatous RGC loss in
rats7. Here we show that elevated IOP induces two phases of
retinal damage: the acute phase correlates with the IOP elevation,
likely mediated by physical stress; the prolonged retinal degen-
eration, which continues even after IOP has returned to normal,
is mediated by T cells. Supporting this notion, mice deficient in
T cells, but not B cells, displayed a dramatically attenuated RGC
and axon damage. Adoptive transfer of CD4+ T cells, but not
total IgG antibodies, from diseased mice restored the progressive
retinal
neurodegeneration
in
Rag1−/−
recipients.
Adoptive
transfer of CD4+ T cells from HSP27- but not OVA-immunized
mice augmented the progressive retinal neurodegeneration in
MB-injected B6 recipients. Similarly, adoptive transfer of CD4+
T cells from HSP27-immunized mice into MB-injected Rag1−/−
recipient mice induced 16 ± 2.1% (n = 5/group) more RGC loss
2 weeks after cell transfer as compared to those receiving T cells
from OVA-immunized mice. The kinetics of T-cell infiltration
into the retinas and their specificity for HSPs lends further sup-
port for their involvement in the progressive retinal degeneration.
Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicates an essential role
for commensal microflora in T-cell activation. Lack of HSP-
specific T-cell responses and neural damage in GF mice offers the
first and compelling evidence supporting that mere elevation of
IOP does not directly attribute to progressive neurodegeneration.
It is the subsequent event, involving T-cell responses, which have

 been pre-sensitized by commensal microflora, that mediates
progressive glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Finally, we show
that HSP-specific T-cell responses occur not only in glaucoma-
tous mice but also in patients with glaucoma. The induction of
HSP-specific T cells is not a result of general stress responses as
patients with retinal detachment or traumatic skin diseases did
not induce HSP-specific T-cell responses. These findings show
that IOP elevation triggers secondary anti-HSP CD4+ T-cell
responses that mediate a prolonged retinal neurodegeneration,
providing an explanation for continued neurodegeneration in
patients with normal or perfectly controlled IOP.

coma and bacterial infections, such as by Helicobacter pylori25.

 T cells may precede the clinical onset of a disease in the eye is
supported by a recent study in a uveitis animal model26. Using
transgenic mice expressing a T-cell receptor (TCR) specific to
IRBP in the retina, the authors showed that commensal micro-
biota is required for the activation of transgenic T cells to cause
uveitis. Although both our and the previous studies demonstrated
the requirement of commensal microflora and autoreactive T cells
in inflammatory diseases in the eye, the two studies differ in
several aspects. The previous study examined how autoreactive
transgenic T cells were activated to cause uveitis—a model of
experimental encephalomyelitis; whereas, our study examined
how endogenous T cells could be activated to perpetuate glau-
comatous retinal neurodegeneration. Furthermore, our study
identified both bacterial and host HSPs as likely key natural
antigens, and showed that commensal microflora induces HSP-
specific memory T cells, which are then activated by host HSPs
induced in the retina after IOP elevation. Our study also showed
that elevated IOP-induced degeneration of RGCs and axons was
partially attenuated in ASF mice with eight defined bacteria,
suggesting that induction of CD4+ T-cell responses by HSPs
requires a diverse flora rather than a specific bacterium. Thus, our
study shows how physical stress, HSPs, microbial flora, and
T
cells
interact
in
the
pathogenesis
of
glaucomatous
neurodegeneration.
Induction of HSP expression has been documented to associate
with various pathological conditions in the retina and brain27,28,
and similar mechanisms may underly other causes of neurode-
generation. Intracellular expression of HSPs is thought to protect
neurons and axons from stress-induced damage29,30 and pro-
motes nerve regeneration31. However, it has been reported that
membrane-bound and extracellular HSPs, which are likely to be
“seen” by antigen-presenting cells and T cells, elicit immune
responses of the adaptive or innate immune system32. Our results
show that elevation of IOP upregulates membrane-bound and
extracellular HSPs in the GCL, subsequently leading to immune-
mediated neural damage through activating HSP-specific CD4+
T cells, which are originally induced by microbial HSPs. As
microbes and humans share significant homologies in many other
proteins, it is likely that HSPs are not the only cross-reactive
antigens involved. The same mechanism of molecular mimicry
may activate T cells, which are originally induced by other
microbial proteins. Consequently, this may lead to induction of
autoimmune responses under stress conditions. T-cell sensitiza-
tion and progressive neurodegeneration were also noted in other
conditions involving HSP upregulation, including retinal ische-
mia and optic nerve trauma (unpublished data). Identification of
CD4+ T-cell responses in glaucoma opens the possibility of tar-
geting T cells in the retina as a treatment to halt the progressive
RGC and axon degeneration and vision loss.
Induction of retinal damage by adoptive transfer of CD4+
T cells is associated with local injury/inflammation, such as that
induced by elevated IOP. We noted that neurodegeneration was
observed following T-cell transfer only into high IOP mice, but
not those with a normal IOP, suggesting that local inflammation
is required for T-cell infiltration into the retina. This offers an
explanation for why glaucomatous neural damage is limited to
the retina and optic nerve as elevated IOP selectively causes
inflammation in these areas. This notion is supported by the
observation that peripheral administration of lipopolysaccharide
exacerbated neuron loss in glaucoma33. Another report, however,
showed that neurodegeneration could be induced in mice even
with a normal IOP 8 weeks or longer after adoptive transfer of
T cells isolated from genetic mouse models of glaucoma34. It
suggests that activated T cells of glaucomatous mice are also
capable of entering the retina with an intact blood-retinal barrier,
although probably at a much slower rate or under certain
conditions.
Presently, it is unclear which subsets of T cells serve as effector
cells or act as initiators of glaucomatous neurodegeneration. TH
cells are characterized by different cytokine profiles, which are
key contributors to immune diseases and commonly used to

 define the functional subsets of T cells35. Thus, in the present
study, we investigated cytokine secretion profiles of CD4+ T cells,
including IFN-γ (TH1), IL-4 (TH2), IL-17 (TH17), and TGF-β (T-
cell subsets with regulatory functions). We found that T cells
from glaucomatous retina secreted IFN-γ, suggesting they are TH1
cells, which are known to mediate inflammation and DTH
reactions. TH2 cells predominantly secrete IL-4 and stimulate the
proliferation of B cells and production of antibodies; TH17 cells
produce proinflammatory cytokine IL-17 and play a major role in
autoimmunity; Treg and those with a regulatory function, in
contrast, are important for the control of immune responses to
self-antigens, preventing autoimmunity and maintaining self-
tolerance. While our data suggest that TH1 cells are the pre-
dominant subset infiltrating the glaucomatous retina, it is
increasingly recognized that “one pathogenic TH cell” and “one
cytokine” does not fit the bill of autoimmune pathology anymore.
Involvement of multiple different effector T-cell subsets in
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, via overlapping or
distinct mechanisms, has been documented. Similar mechanisms
can also be involved in glaucomatous neurodegeneration con-
sidering that IOP elevation induced activation of all four subsets
of CD4+ T cells in the spleen and draining LN. Autoimmune
responses in the retina usually start with the activation of
microglia, which can function as antigen-presenting cells to
capture and present antigens36,37, such as HSPs. This in turn
triggers HSP-specific T-cell responses in the draining LN and
retinal production of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor
necrosis factor-α and IL-1β, that can continue after the IOP has
returned to a normal range. These cytokines are known to weaken
the blood-retinal barrier, allowing or facilitating T-cell infiltration
into the retina38,39. Disruption of the blood-retina barrier has
been reported in patients with POAG and in DBA/2J mice, cor-
relating with the IOP elevation40. While we did not detect
apparent vessel leakage in MB-induced glaucomatous mice using
fluorescein angiography, we did observe T-cell infiltration in the
retina of MB-injected eyes. Activated CD4+ T cells can cause
neuronal damage directly as seen in multiple sclerosis or by
activating other immune cell types, such as microglia, through
secreted cytokines such as IFN-γ. Localized cytokine induction
and microglia activation have likely limited the neural damage to
the eye rather then spreading the damage to other sites of the
central nervous system (CNS). Future examination of cytokine
production and T-cell behavior in the retina of GF mice with
elevated IOP will further help elucidate the cellular and molecular
pathways
underlying
T-cell-mediated
neurodegeneration
to
develop therapies. Although these questions remain to be
addressed, our current study provides compelling evidence for
commensal microbial flora-induced HSP-specific CD4+ T cells in
the pathogenesis of chronic neurodegeneration in the eye.
Methods
Mice. Adult (10–16 weeks old) male and female C57BL/6J (B6), Rag1−/−,
TCRβ−/−, Igh6−/−, and GFP transgenic mice (all on a B6 background) and 3- to
12-month-old DBA/2J mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. Mice of
both sexes were evenly randomized into control and experimental groups. All
experimental procedures and use of animals were approved and monitored by the
Institute’s Animal Care Committee and conform to the standards of the National
Institute of Health and the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology.
GF and ASF colonized Swiss Webster mice of both sexes (10–16 weeks old) were
originally purchased from Taconic Biosciences (Germantown, NY) and maintained
at MIT in a genotobiotic core. DBA/2J mice were re-derived by embryo transfer
into the GF health status using GF Swiss Webster recipient mothers. These mice
were maintained in sterile plastic film isolators in open-top polycarbonate cages on
autoclaved hardwood bedding and fed autoclaved water and diet (ProLab 2000,
Purina Mills, St. Louis, MO) ad libitum. Macroenvironmental conditions included
a 14:10 light/dark cycle and temperature maintenance at 68 ± 2 °F. The sterile
plastic film isolators were confirmed to be maintained free of all aerobic and
anaerobic bacteria, and mold by bimonthly microbiologic monitoring of feces from
each cage mixed with drinking water, interior swabs of the isolator walls, and a
sampling of wet food left exposed to trap molds. These composite samples were
screened for contaminants using aerobic and anaerobic culture, PCR, and fecal
Gram stains. Control SPF mice (free of all murine bacterial pathogens, adventitious
viruses, and parasites) were maintained under barrier conditions in standard
microisolator cages under similar environmental conditions, including the same
autoclaved diet and reverse osmosis-purified water. The ASF was originally
developed for colonizing GF rodents with a defined microbiota, consisting of eight
murine bacterial species: two aerotolerant lactobacillus strains, ASF360 and
ASF361; two Clostridium sp. strains, ASF356 and ASF502; Eubacterium sp. strain
ASF492; Bacteroides sp. strain ASF519; low-GpC-content Gram-positive bacterial
strain ASF500; and strain Mucispirillum schaedleri strain ASF45722,41. A cohort of
DBA/2J and Swiss Webster mice was maintained under SPF conditions to serve as
controls. Unless specified, 6–8 mice were used per group in all experiments.
Induction of IOP elevation in mice. IOP was induced in adult mice (10–12 weeks
old) as described previously12. Briefly, mice were anesthetized and supplemented
with topical proparacaine HCl (0.5%; Bausch & Lomb Incorporated, Tampa, FL).
Elevation of IOP was induced unilaterally in adult mice by an anterior chamber
injection of polystyrene MBs having a uniform diameter of 15 μm (Invitrogen),
which were re-suspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at a final
concentration of 5.0 × 106 MB/ml. The control group received an injection of sterile
saline (2 μl) into the anterior chamber. Briefly, the right cornea was gently punc-
tured near the center using a 30-gauge needle to generate an easy entry for
injection. Following this entry wound, 2 μl of MB were injected into the right
anterior chamber using a glass micropipette connected with a Hamilton syringe.
Polystyrene MBs are widely used in the clinic and have proven to be safe without
inducing significant levels of inflammation42,43. No clinical signs of anterior seg-
ment inflammation, including corneal ectasia or neovascularization, inflammatory
cell infiltration into the anterior chamber, or synechiae and fibrosis in the angle
area, were observed. The morphology of the anterior chamber and Schlemm’s canal
appeared normal in MB-injected mice, consistent with previous reports44–46. In all
experimental groups, IOP was measured every other day in both eyes using a
TonoLab tonometer (Colonial Medical Supply) as previously described12. The
measurement of IOP was conducted consistently at the same time in the morning.
Mice were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation (2–4%; Webster Veterinary,
Sterling, MA) delivered in 100% oxygen with a precision vaporizer.
Elevation of IOP in adult GF and ASF mice (16–20 weeks old) was performed in
a sterile laminar flow hood under aseptic conditions. All equipment was gas-
sterilized with ethylene oxide before entering the hood. Sterile drug vials and
bottles were only used once, and discarded after the end of each experiment. IOP
was induced unilaterally in the right eye, by anterior chamber injection of MB as
described; control animals received an injection of sterile saline. For MB injection
and periodic measurement of IOP, GF and ASF mice were exited from their home
isolators in a sealed sterile container and transported to a Clidox (Pharmacal,
Naugatuck, CT) sterilized hood. All manipulations of the mice were performed in
the hood using strict aseptic technique. The mice were returned to separate,
dedicated sterile isolators that were monitored closely for inadvertent
contamination. Since retrieving mice out of the sterile isolators and any
intervention on them increases the risk of contamination, IOP was measured
shortly before anterior chamber injection, and subsequently on only 1, 2, and
8 weeks post injection. IOPs of GF DBA/2J mice were measured at 3, 8, 10, and
12 months of age.
Immunohistochemistry and quantification of RGC and axon loss. For immu-
nohistochemistry, mice were sacrificed and perfused with saline for 5 min to
remove all blood cells from their vessels followed by 4% paraformaldehyde for 15
min, and eyes and optic nerves were dissected. Retinal flat-mounts or transverse
sections were incubated with a primary antibody against CD3, CD4, CD11b, Tuj1,
Brn3a, and RECA1 (all from Invitrogen) followed by an Alexa Fluor 488-
conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Quantification of RGC axon loss in
optic nerve sections was as described47, with minor modifications. All of the
quantification procedures were routinely conducted under a masked fashion.
Briefly, the optic nerve cross sections were traced using NIH Image J software, and
the total area of each cross section was measured. For axon counts, five rectangular
regions (64 µm × 85 µm) covering the entire optic nerve cross areas were photo-
graphed at ×1000 magnification (Nikon Eclipse E800), and four rectangular regions
(30 µm × 30 µm) were cropped from each of the five rectangular areas. Axons were
identified by the microbules and axolemma surrounded by the electron-dense
myelin sheath, and all axons in the 20 selected regions, covering approximately
50% of the total optic nerve area, were counted. The percentage of axon loss was
determined by dividing the axonal density calculated from the optic nerve with
high IOP to that of the contralateral control optic nerve of the same mouse in B6
mice, or to that of 3-month-old (normal IOP) DBA/2J mice. RGC loss was assessed
quantitatively in retinal flat-mounts using a standard protocol described pre-
viously12 with minor modifications. In brief, retinal flat-mounts were incubated
with a primary antibody against a RGC marker, β-III-tubulin48 (Tuj1; Sigma-
Aldrich, St.), followed by a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody. Immuno-positive
cells in 24 areas from each retina (×400; 12 areas taken from the peripheral retina, 8
from the intermediate regions, and 4 from the central retina), each covering 0.09
mm2, were counted12. The numbers were averaged to calculate the RGC densities,

 and the percentage of RGC loss was determined by dividing the RGC density
calculated from the retina with high IOP by that of the contralateral control retina
of the same mouse in B6 mice or by that of 3-month-old (normal IOP) DBA/2J
mice.
Isolation and adoptive transfer of CD4+ T cells. Single-cell suspensions were
prepared from spleens in RPMI-1640 media (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% L-glutamine after lysis of red
blood cells with red blood cell lysis buffer (Sigma). CD4+ T cells were purified
using an auto MACS Separator and a CD4+ T Cell Isolation Kit (MiltenyiBiotec)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, CD4+ T cells were negatively
selected from splenocytes of HSP27-immunized mice, or from mice with high IOP,
by depletion with a mixture of lineage-specific biotin-conjugated antibodies against
CD8 (Ly-2), CD11b (Mac-1), CD45R (B220), CD49b (DX5), Ter-119, and anti-
biotin MBs. The procedure yielded purity higher than 90% CD4+ T cells, as
assessed by flow cytometry. These cells (2 × 108 cells/mouse in 200 µl PBS) were
adoptively transferred into recipient mice via tail vein injection. Control animals
received the same numbers of CD4+ T cells, isolated from mice with normal IOP
or from OVA-immunized mice.
ELISA and ELISPOT Assays. Sera were collected from mice injected with MB or
saline. Ninety-six-well plates (Nunc) were pre-coated with recombinant human
HSP27 or HSP60 protein (1 µg/ml) blocked with 10% normal goat serum, followed
by addition of diluted serum samples (1:10) and anti-HSP27 or anti-HSP60 anti-
body (1:10 as positive controls) and incubation for 2 h at room temperature.
Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (or human) IgG (1:1,000) were
added and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. TMP substrate (Sigma) was
added and optical density was measured at excitation wavelength 405 nm using
XFlour4 software. Each sample was processed and analyzed in triplicate.
A mouse IFN-γ ELISPOT assay (eBioscience) was used to determine the
frequency of IFNγ-producing T cells in response to HSP27 or HSP60. ELISPOT
plates (Multiscreen-MAIPS4510), pre-coated with 100 µl/well of capture antibody,
were blocked with 200 µl/well of complete RPMI-1640 medium. Mouse splenocytes
(1 × 106 cells/well) were added and incubated with antigens, including HSP27 or
HSP60 (Sigma-Aldrich), E. coli HSP24 or HSP60 (EnzoLifesciences), IRBP, and
MBP (Invitrogen), at a final concentration of 10 µg/ml, for 48 h. Cell cultures
incubated alone were used as controls. Results are shown as the mean number of
antigen-specific spot forming cells after background subtraction from the control
wells containing no antigen.
Flow cytometry assays. The mouse cervical LNs, spleen, or retina were freshly
isolated. LNs and spleens were dissociated using forceps; the cell mixtures were
filtered through a 70 µm nylon mesh. For the neuroretina, two to three retinas were
combined for each test and dissociated using Papain Dissociation system (Wor-
thington Biochemical Product). Dissociated cells taken from the cervical LNs,
spleen, or retina were immunolabeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Biolegend)-
or PerCP/Cy5.5 (BD Bioscience)-conjugated anti-CD4 antibody. The cells were
then permeabilized with permeabilizing/washing buffer (Biolegend), followed by
immunolabeling for cytokines with Alexa Fluor 488 (BD Bioscience)- or
phycoerythrin-conjugated primary antibodies against IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-17, or TGF-β
(BioLegend) for 30 min at 4 °C in dark. Corresponding isotype antibodies were
used as controls. Data were collected with BD LSR II Flow Cytometer as
20,000–30,000 events and analyzed by FlowJo (Tree Star).
Preparation of human blood samples and T-cell assays. Patients (40–60 years)
who had been diagnosed with POAG with unambiguous clinical evidence of
pathological “cupping” of the optic nerve head and documentation of visual field
loss, were recruited for this study. Recruited control subjects showed no evidence of
optic nerve or CNS damage from any cause, and were found to have no significant
visual or neurological disorder. In addition, patients with retinal detachment as
well as those suffering from skin injuries were examined to exclude the possibility
that the increase in HSP27- and Hsp60-responsive T cells in POAG was a result of
stress responses to inflammation or disease conditions independent of POAG. All
participants were provided with informed consent to participate in the relevant
research resources. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board
(IRB) of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear. Sixteen milliliters of venous blood was
drawn from each volunteer into a vacutainer CPT tube (Becton Dickinson) with
sodium citrate and processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
peripheral blood mononuclear cells were re-suspended at 1.0 × 107 cells/ml in
RPMI containing 20% heat-inactivated FBS. ELISPOT and ELISA assays were
performed as described above. The measurements were performed in a masked
fashion.
Delayed-type hypersensitivity assay. The thickness of the mouse ear was
measured using a micrometer prior to antigen stimulation. The dorsal side of the
ear was injected intradermally with 10 µl of human recombinant HSP27 (1 µg/µl;
Enzo Life Science) or with a control antigen—either MBP or IRBP (1 µg/µl; Invi-
trogen). The thickness of the injected ear was measured again after 24 and 48 h,
respectively, and change in thickness was calculated. We did not find significant
differences between the results obtained at 24 and 48 h; thus, only results obtained
at 24 h were reported.
HSP27 inoculation. To immunize mice, 50 µl of human recombinant HSP27 (50
µg; Enzo Life Science) was emulsified with 50 µl incomplete Freund’s adjuvant
emulsion and injected subcutaneously in adult B6 mice. Two to three weeks later,
immune responses to HSP27 were analyzed by DTH and ELISPOT assays.
Statistical analysis. Based on the 90% statistical power analysis done with our
previous data in glaucoma studies, six mice per group were shown to yield over
95% significance, two-sided test12,49–51. This is also the group size commonly used
in other reports seeking statistical significance in rodent models of experimental
glaucoma52,53. Thus, most of our experiments used a group size of six to eight
animals, unless otherwise indicated. Scatter and bar plots are presented as mean ±
s.e.m., and a paired analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis.
