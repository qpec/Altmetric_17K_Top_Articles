IMPORTANCE Published guidelines describing effective adolescent depression care in primary
care settings include screening, assessment, treatment initiation, and symptom monitoring. It
is unclear the extent to which these steps are documented in patient health records.
OBJECTIVE To determine rates of appropriate follow-up care for adolescents with newly
identified depression symptoms in 3 large health systems.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this analysis conducted from March to September
2014, structured data retrospectively extracted from electronic health records were analyzed
for 3 months following initial symptom identification to determine whether the patient was
followed up and, if so, whether treatment was initiated and/or symptoms were monitored.
Records were collected from 2 large health maintenance organizations in the western United
States and a network of community health centers in the Northeast. The study group
included adolescents (N = 4612) with newly identified depression symptoms, defined as an
elevated score on the Patient Health Questionnaire (�10) and/or a diagnosis of depression.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Rates of treatment initiation, symptom monitoring, and
follow-up care documented within 3 months of initial symptom identification.
RESULTS Among the 4612 participants, the mean (SD) age at index event was 16.0 (2.3)
years, and 3060 were female (66%). Treatment was initiated for nearly two-thirds of
adolescents (79% of those with a diagnosis of major depression; n = 1023); most received
psychotherapy alone or in combination with medications. However, in the 3 months following
identification, 36% of adolescents received no treatment (n = 1678), 68% did not have a
follow-up symptom assessment (n = 3136), and 19% did not receive any follow-up care
(n = 854). Further, 40% of adolescents prescribed antidepressant medication did not have
any documentation of follow-up care for 3 months (n = 356). Younger age (ages 15-17 years:
odds ratio [OR], 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67-0.92 and ages 18-20 years: OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70-0.99;
P = .008), more severe initial symptoms (moderate: OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.82-1.21; moderate
to severe: OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.19-1.80; and severe: OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.65-2.79; P < .001), and
receiving a diagnosis (major depression/dysthymia: OR, 2.65; 95% CI, 2.20-3.20 and
unspecified depression/adjustment disorder: OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.43-2.14; P < .001) were
significantly associated with treatment initiation. Differences in rates of follow-up care were
evident between sites (site 2: OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.45-2.16 and site 3: OR, 2.10; 95% CI,
1.72-2.57), suggesting that differences within health systems may also affect care received.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Most adolescents with newly identified depression symptoms
received some treatment, usually including psychotherapy, within the first 3 months after
identification. However, follow-up care was low and substantial variation existed between
sites. These results raise concerns about the quality of care for adolescent depression.

M
ajor depression is a chronic, disabling condition
affecting 12% of adolescents,1 with as many as 26%
of youth experiencing at least mild depressive
symptoms.2 Depression impairs social and academic func-
tioning and is associated with poor long-term outcomes.3-5 As
many as 8% of youth who develop depression during adoles-
cencecompletesuicidebyyoungadulthood,3andmedicalcosts
associated with adolescent depression are higher than those
for almost any other mental health condition.3,6
Timely initiation of effective treatment is crucial because
failure to achieve remission is associated with higher likeli-
hood of relapse, developing recurrent depression, and more
impairedlong-termfunctioning.7,8Earlyinterventionforsymp-
tomatic youth may also prevent development of a depressive
episode.9Adolescentsdiagnosedashavingdepressionwhoen-
ter treatment at a younger age, earlier in the course of a de-
pressive episode, and prior to developing chronic depression
have better outcomes following acute treatment.10 However,
although effective treatments exist, up to 80% of adoles-
cents with depression do not receive appropriate care.11
This gap in care and the emergence of child mental health
care as a national priority12 spurred efforts to improve care. Pri-
mary care settings have been targeted to increase early identi-
fication and access to effective care.13,14 Depression care tool-
kits and practice guidelines have been disseminated to support
primary care physicians (PCPs) in evidence-based identifica-
tion and treatment of adolescent depression.15-17 Previous leg-
islation (ie, 2009 Child Health Insurance Program Reauthori-
zationActand2010PatientProtectionandAffordableCareAct)
emphasizedadherencetoeffectivecarestandardsandaccount-
abilityforthequalityofcarethroughthedevelopmentofhealth
care quality measures/indicators. In an effort to identify evi-
dence-based targets for quality measures, synthesize avail-
able PCP guidelines, and inform a research agenda, Lewan-
dowski and colleagues18 developed a care pathway describing
“essentialpracticesforadolescentdepressionmanagementfrom
screening to symptom remission.
”
Federal initiatives incentivizing universal use of elec-
tronic health records (EHRs), including the 2009 American Re-
covery and Reinvestment Act and Health Information Tech-
nology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, increased the
number of opportunities to conduct comprehensive, timely
evaluations of care. Incentives for meaningful use of EHRs tar-
getenhancedcarecoordinationandreducedmedicalerrorsand
provide a platform from which to conduct large-scale routine
measurement of care quality. However, most of these initia-
tives do not include behavioral health indices.19
Littleempiricalresearchhasevaluatedroutinecareforado-

The current study aimed to add to this emerging litera-
turebyevaluatingtheinitialcourseofcareforadolescentsiden-
tified with depressive symptoms in primary care settings as it
is documented in the EHR. This study examined routine care
in several large health care systems to assess whether adoles-
cents newly identified as having depression symptoms re-
ceived appropriate follow-up care in the 3 months following
identification. Elements of appropriate follow-up care were
based on the depression care management pathway18 and in-
cluded initiating antidepressant or psychotherapy treat-
ment, having at least 1 follow-up visit, and symptom moni-
toring with a well-validated questionnaire.
Method
Data Sources and Sample
Data were abstracted from EHRs of 3 large health care systems,
with analysis conducted from March to September 2014. Orga-
nizations were recruited through colleagues and prior collabo-
rations and were identified for study inclusion if they used any

12 to 20 years on January 1, 2012, with at least 1 face-to-face
PCP visit during the intake period and documented symp-
toms of depression. At the health maintenance organiza-
tions, participants were limited to those continuously en-
rolled during the study period.
The index event was the first evidence of newly identi-
fied symptoms of depression, defined by elevated PHQ score
(≥10), new depression diagnosis, or both within the same 30-
day period. To determine both history and follow-up care, data
were collected for 6 months before and 3 months after the in-
dex event. Patients with evidence of bipolar, psychotic, au-
tism spectrum, or personality disorders at any time were ex-
cluded. Because a primary aim of this study was to evaluate
care for newly identified depression symptoms, patients were
also excluded if there was evidence 6 months prior to the in-
dex event of depression diagnosis, antidepressants pre-
scribed, or previous positive PHQ score. Data collected in-
cluded (1) dates of administration and scores for all depression
symptom questionnaires; (2) dates, Current Procedural Ter-
minology codes, and encounter diagnoses for all face-to-face
primary care or mental health visits/encounters; (3) dates and
active psychopharmocologic compounds for all antidepres-
sants prescribed or recorded on a medications list; and (4)
demographic information.
Measures
Depression Symptoms
The PHQ-9 is a 9-item self-report questionnaire assessing de-
pression symptoms and severity that has been validated for
use with adolescents.26,27 Very slight modifications have been
made for adolescents (eg, replacing an item about “work” to
“schoolwork”), resulting in the PHQ-9 Modified for Adoles-
cents and the PHQ-Modified for teens. All sites used at least 1
of these versions with their adolescent population, collec-
tively referred to hereafter as PHQ. The PHQ items are based
on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(Fourth Edition) criteria for major depression and are rated on
a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (“not at all”) to 3 (“nearly ev-
ery day”). A score of 10 or higher indicates clinically signifi-
cantsymptoms(“moderatedepression”)andisconsistentwith
clinical cutoffs reportedly used by PCPs within each site.
Depression Diagnosis
DepressiondiagnosesinthecurrentstudyincludedInternational
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision28 codes that indicate
clinicallysignificantsymptomsofdepression:majordepressive
affective disorder, other and unspecified depressive disorders,
dysthymia,andadjustmentdisordersthatreflectsignificantde-
pressivesymptoms(ie,withdepressedmood;withmixedanxi-
ety and depressed mood; with mixed disturbance of emotions
and conduct; and prolonged depressive reaction).
Demographic Information
Demographic information was collected from EHR data fields.
Variables included age, sex, race, ethnicity, insurance status
at index event, presence of chronic medical conditions (eg,
asthma, obesity, or other physical health conditions) and co-
occurring behavioral health diagnoses.
Medication Treatment
Antidepressantmedicationtreatmentwasdeterminedbyanin-
dicationofanantidepressantonthepatient’
smedicationlistor
in a specific field for prescription information within the EHR.
Psychotherapy Treatment
Any visit including a Current Procedural Terminology code for
psychotherapy was identified.
Statistical Analyses
Standard descriptive statistics were used to summarize demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics overall and across sites.
Rates of treatment initiation within 3 months were compared
across levels of demographic and clinical characteristics, with
statistical hypothesis tests conducted by χ2 tests. Logistic re-
gression models were used to compare the odds of any treat-
ment initiation within 3 months across levels of demographic
and clinical characteristics and across sites. Univariate and bi-
variate analyses were conducted to describe the sample and
compare differences across organizations and patient charac-
teristics. Logistic regression analyses were performed to as-
sess the impact of demographic and clinical characteristics on
treatment initiation. Demographic (age, sex, race, and ethnic-
ity) and clinical (index event, symptom severity, and diagno-
sis) characteristics were included in the regression models if
they significantly contributed to the model (ie, P < .05). Data
were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 21.29
Results
Descriptives
A total of 4612 adolescents (67% female) were identified with
depressionsymptoms.Significantdifferencesacrosssiteswere
evident for all baseline variables except patient sex (Table 1).
Most adolescents were white (63%) and not identified as His-
panic/Latino (74%), although race/ethnicity data were fre-
quently missing (21%). Sites 2 and 3 primarily served patients
with commercial insurance/self-pay (95% [n = 1669] and 99%
[n = 1989], respectively), while most patients at site 1 had Med-
icaid/Children’
s Health Insurance Program insurance (72%;
n = 617). Nearly two-thirds of patients had comorbid behav-
ioral health diagnoses, and chronic physical health condi-
tions were also common, at 41% (n = 347) at site 1 and 70%
(n = 1232) at site 2 (not reported at site 3).
Most patients were identified at the index event through a
positivePHQscorealone(site1 = 57%[n = 487]andsite3 = 59%
[n = 1187]), or a new depression diagnosis alone (site 2 = 51%
[n = 889]). Diagnoses at the index event were most often major
depression(47%;n = 1295)orother/unspecifieddepression(24%;
n = 654). The average PHQ score at the index event indicated
moderately severe symptoms (mean [SD], 15.3 [4.1]), although
thiswassignificantlyloweratsite1(mean[SD],14.0[3.6]),con-
sistent with moderate symptoms. Adolescents identified with
a positive PHQ score only had a significantly lower score (mean
[SD], 15.5 [3.9]) than those with both a positive PHQ score and
anewdiagnosis(mean[SD],16.4[4.2]).Amongadolescentswith
a positive PHQ score only, 12% (n = 227) received a depression

Symptom Monitoring
Regardless of other follow-up care, documentation of symp-
tom monitoring (ie, PHQ administered) in the 3-month fol-
low-up period was present for only 32% of adolescents
(n = 1486). Significant differences between sites indicated that
patients at site 1 were less likely to have a PHQ score recorded
(6%) than sites 2 (31%) or 3 (44%) (P < .001).
Treatment Initiation
Sixty-fourpercentofadolescentsinitiatedtreatmentwithinthe

29% (n = 1315) received psychotherapy only, and 16% (n = 728)

least likely to receive any treatment (54%). Higher initial PHQ
scores (ie, more severe symptoms) and diagnoses of major de-

ceiving treatment.
Treatment initiation was significantly associated with site

Discussion
Rates of appropriate follow-up care for adolescents with newly
identified depression symptoms in 3 large health systems were
examined via structured data retrospectively extracted from
EHRs.Treatmentwasinitiatedfornearlytwo-thirdsofadolescents
(n = 2934),mostofwhomreceivedpsychotherapy.Nearly80%

centofadolescents(n = 854)identifiedwithclinicallysignificant
depression symptoms, and 40% of adolescents (n = 356) pre-
scribedantidepressantshadnodocumentationoffollow-upcare.
Differences in rates of follow-up care were evident across sites,
suggesting differences within health systems may affect care.
Appropriatelyidentifyingsymptomsanddiagnosesareini-
tial steps in the adolescent depression care pathway18 and are
essentialtoprovidingadequatefollow-upcareandtreatment.30
Essential to assessment is measuring symptom severity31 and
70% of adolescents received a symptom-based questionnaire
(PHQ) at the index event. Symptom assessment is critical to
guiding treatment decisions for depressed adolescents be-
cause initial PHQ scores have been associated with symptom
severity up to 6 months later.32
The presence of both an elevated PHQ score and a new di-
agnosis at the index event is arguably representative of higher

into this category (13%-37%). Variability across sites was evi-

may reflect PCPs’lack of diagnostic confidence or use of these
diagnoses “in lieu of,

sociated with major depression. Importantly, neither a PHQ
score nor a recorded diagnosis confirm that an adequate clini-

Regardlessofdiagnosis,19%ofadolescentsidentifiedwith

mild symptoms by current guidelines and best practices.18
These findings raise concerns that many adolescents with de-

psychotherapy as first-line treatment, particularly for younger
adolescents or youth with mild symptoms.18
HalfofadolescentswithonlyapositivePHQscoreatthein-
dexeventinitiatedtreatment,29%ofwhomreceivedantidepres-
sants. A small percentage of adolescents identified with a posi-
tive PHQ score only received a depression or other behavioral
health diagnosis later in the follow-up period, possibly reflect-
ing initial observation or further assessment. The remaining
youthstreatedwithoutadiagnosismayreflectPCPs’reluctance
todiagnose,althoughtheyrecognizedtheneedtoprovidecare.
Regardless of treatment initiation, symptom monitoring
is recommended.21,22 A study of a collaborative care model,
includingregularsymptommonitoring,foundsignificantlybet-
terdepressionoutcomesforadolescents.24Inthecurrentstudy,
rates of symptom monitoring were modest (32%). Significant
variability across sites may represent the impact of organiza-
tional policy on care. Site 3 reported policies requiring PHQs
be administered for antidepressant refills, possibly driving the
noticeablyhigherrateofsymptommonitoringatthesite(44%).
In contrast, site 1, where rates of symptom monitoring were
6%, reported policies encouraging universal screening but not
symptom monitoring.
The primary limitation of this and other studies relying on
medical record (EHR) data are that conclusions depend on how
information is gathered and recorded. Distinctions between
lack of appropriate follow-up care or failure to document care
events cannot be made. Alternative appropriate PCP behav-
iors (eg, specialist referrals and telephone follow-up contact)
orrelevantpatientbehaviors(treatmentdropout/refusal,elect-
ing to receive care elsewhere, change in insurance or loca-
tion, and barriers to access including transportation and in-
surance coverage) were not evaluated in the current study
because such information was rarely documented in struc-
tured data fields. Future studies should seek to accurately as-
sess the extent to which PCPs conduct accurate clinical as-
sessments that inform appropriate follow-up care.
These challenges to documentation are common to EHR-
based research evaluations of mental health care quality.37
However, similar documentation is required for quality mea-
surement, quality-improvement initiatives, and continuity of
care. Thus, limitations of data availability are not only prob-
lematic for research, but also reflect limitations in what mem-
bers of the clinical team are able to learn about the patient.
Therefore, limitations of EHR documentation are themselves
likely contributors to poor quality of care.
Finally, it is unclear the extent to which findings from the
current study are generalizable beyond the settings in which
data were collected. Differences in outcomes and potential
health care disparities between site 1 (serving predominantly
racial/ethnic minority Medicaid recipients) and sites 2 and 3
(serving primarily white, privately insured youths) were not
explored in the current study; and, in fact, high rates of miss-
ing data (eg, race/ethnicity) hinder further analyses. More-
over, the participating sites are highly regarded health care in-
stitutions. They are often looked to as leaders in cutting-edge
care that routinely use quality-improvement initiatives fo-
cused on adolescent behavioral health care. Thus, results from
the current study, discouraging as they are, may overstate the
quality of care in other settings.
Conclusions
Current standards of care recommend that adolescents identi-
fiedwithdepressionsymptomsreceivefurtherassessment,ini-
tiateantidepressantmedicationand/orpsychotherapytreatment,
and are monitored for changes in symptoms, especially follow-
inganantidepressantprescription.Evidencefromthisstudysug-
geststhatqualityofcareinroutinepracticedivergesfromthese
standards. Given the negative outcomes associated with un-
treatedadolescentdepression,3-5greaterattentiontoimproving
adherence to quality standards is warranted.

Editor's Note
Pediatric Quality Measures
Frederick P. Rivara, MD, MPH
The 2009 Children’
s Health Insurance Program Reauthoriza-
tion Act (CHIPRA) included requirements for the develop-
ment of a core set of chil-
dren’
s health care quality
measures and the develop-
ment of a Pediatric Quality
Measures Program. Seven Centers of Excellence were funded
bytheAgencyforHealthcareResearchandQualityandtheCen-
ters for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The goal was to fur-
ther develop the core set of children’
s health care quality mea-
sures and increase the portfolio of evidence-based measures
thatcanbeusedbypublicandprivatepurchasersofhealthcare,
as well as by health care professionals and consumers. JAMA
Pediatrics will have a rolling theme issue in which the best
research on the development and testing of these core mea-
sures is presented.1
