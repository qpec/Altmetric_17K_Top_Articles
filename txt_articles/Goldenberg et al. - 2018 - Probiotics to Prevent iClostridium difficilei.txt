 Probiotics to Prevent Clostridium difficile Infection in
Patients Receiving Antibiotics
Joshua Z. Goldenberg, ND; Dominik Mertz, MD; Bradley C. Johnston, PhD
Introduction
Antibiotics are commonly prescribed and are associated with
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and its complications including
toxic megacolon and death.1 Recent data suggest that treating CDI
costs $24 205 per patient.2 This JAMA Clinical Evidence Synopsis
summarizes a recent Cochrane review.3
Summary of Findings
Co-administration of probiotics and antibiotics was associated with
alowerriskforCDIvsplaceboornotreatment(70/4525[1.5%]vs164/
4147 [4.0%], respectively; risk ratio [RR], 0.40 [95% CI, 0.30-0.52],
P < .001) based on moderate-quality evidence using the Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation
(GRADE)andanumberneededtotreat(NNT)of40(Figure).There-
sults did not substantially change in predefined subgroups consist-
ing of inpatients, outpatients, adults, children, probiotic species or
strains,lowerprobioticdoses,higherprobioticdoses,orstudiesathigh
risk vs low risk of bias.
Inaposthocsubgroupanalysisoftrialsgroupedbybaselinerisk
of CDI (determined by the event risk for placebo or no treatment),
there was no association of probiotics plus antibiotics with CDI re-
duction in trials with a risk of CDI of 0%-2% or 3%-5% vs placebo or
notreatment;however,therewasanassociationwithCDIreduction
in trials with CDI risk greater than 5% (43/1370 [3.1%] vs 126/1084
[11.6%]; RR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.21-0.42], P = .01; GRADE: moderate-
quality evidence; NNT, 12).
Probiotics plus antibiotics were associated with a lower risk of
adverse events such as abdominal cramping and nausea vs pla-
cebo or no treatment (620/4329 [14.3%] vs 677/3976 [17.0%]; RR,
0.83 [95% CI, 0.71 to 0.97], P = .02; GRADE: very low–quality evi-
dence; NNT, 37). No trials reported serious adverse events attrib-
utabletoprobiotics.Probioticsplusantibioticswereassociatedwith
alowerriskofantibiotic-associateddiarrheavsplaceboornotreat-
ment(565/4618[12.2%]vs771/4252[18.1%];RR,0.58[95%CI,0.48
to 0.70], P < .001; GRADE: low-quality evidence; NNT, 17).
Discussion
Among 31 studies comparing antibiotics and probiotics vs placebo
or no treatment for preventing CDI in patients receiving antibiot-
ics, probiotics were associated with a lower risk of CDI, adverse
events, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea. In a post hoc analysis,
a statistically significant association between probiotic use and the
riskofCDIwasfoundamongtrialswithahighbaselineCDIrisk(>5%).
However, the subgroup with a CDI risk of 3% to 5% was likely un-
derpowered. Typical US hospitals have a CDI risk below 5%.
Limitations
First,trialswerecombinedacrossclinicalsettings(inpatientvsout-
patient), age, probiotic strains and dose, and risk of bias. Second,
trialswereconductedinimmunocompetentpatientsonly,thus,gen-
eralizability to immunocompromised patients is unclear. Third, not
all trials were appropriately blinded, although excluding unblinded
studies did not substantially change the results.
Comparison of Findings With Current Practice Guidelines
Current guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology,
theAssociationforProfessionalsinInfectionControlandEpidemiol-
ogy, and the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infec-
tious Diseases do not specifically recommend probiotic prophylaxis
when antibiotics are prescribed, citing insufficient evidence.
Evidence Profile
No. of randomized clinical trials: 39 (31 providing data on CDI)
Study years: 1988-2012 (conducted), 1989-2016 (published)
Last search date: March 21, 2017
No. of patients: 9955
Male: 52%; Female: 48%
Race/ethnicity: Varied by country
Age, mean (range): 51 years (0-84 years)
Setting:Inpatient,outpatient,andcombinedinpatientandoutpatient
Countries: Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Finland, Germany, Italy,
Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russia, Sweden, Turkey,
United Kingdom, United States
Comparisons: Adults (33 trials) and children (6 trials) receiving
antibiotics randomized to single or multistrain probiotics vs placebo
ornotreatment.ProbioticgeneraincludedSaccharomyces,Lactobacilli,
Bifidobacteria, and Streptococci.
Primary outcomes: CDI (diarrhea with positive stool toxin or
culture), adverse events
Secondary outcomes: C difficile detection (or toxin in stool
without diarrhea), antibiotic-associated diarrhea
CLINICAL QUESTION In adults and children prescribed antibiotics, is co-administration of
a probiotic associated with a lower risk of symptomatic Clostridium difficile infection
without an increase in adverse events?
BOTTOM LINE Moderate-quality evidence suggests that probiotics are associated with a
lower risk of C difficile infection and very low–quality evidence suggests that probiotics are
associated with fewer adverse events vs placebo or no treatment.

 Areas in Need of Future Study
Further research is needed to identify high-risk populations that
may benefit most from the addition of probiotics to antibiotic
treatment(eg,thoseknowntobecolonizedwithCdifficileandthose
with a history of CDI), and to explore the risk-to-benefit ratio in
those who are immunocompromised.4
