Abstract
White women with type II diabetes (T2D) have an estimated
20% increased risk of developing breast cancer. Little is known
about associations by breast cancer subtype or among African
American (AA) women, who are disproportionately affected by
T2D and estrogen receptor negative (ER�) breast cancer. We
assessed the relation of T2D to incidence of ER� and ERþ
breast cancer in data from the Black Women's Health Study, a
prospective cohort of AA women enrolled in 1995 and fol-
lowed biennially. During 847,934 person-years of follow-up,
there were 1,851 incident invasive breast cancers, including
914 ERþ and 468 ER� cases. Multivariable Cox proportional
hazards models were used to compute HRs for breast cancer
incidence associated with T2D relative to no T2D, controlling
for body mass index (BMI) and other potential confounders.
The HR for T2D relative to no T2D was 1.18 [95% confidence
interval (CI) 1.00–1.40] for overall breast cancer incidence,
with the increase accounted for by ER� cancer: HRs were 1.02
(95% CI, 0.80–1.31) for ERþ and 1.43 (95% CI, 1.03–2.00) for
ER� cancer. The HR for T2D and ER� breast cancer was highest
among nonobese women (1.92; 95% CI, 1.22–3.04). The
findings suggest that AA women with T2D are at increased risk
of developing ER� breast cancer and that poor metabolic
health may be more important than obesity for this subtype.
Given the high prevalence of T2D in AA women, the observed
association could, in part, explain racial disparities in incidence
of ER� breast cancer. Cancer Res; 77(22); 6462–9. �2017 AACR.
Introduction
Diabetes mellitus has been hypothesized to play a role in the
development of breast cancer. Postulated mechanisms include
effects of hyperinsulinemia on sex-steroid availability (1, 2) and
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) production (3, 4). Hormone-
independent mechanisms, including chronic inflammation with
high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, infiltration of adipose
depots with proinflammatory macrophages, and associated oxi-
dative stress, have also been proposed (5). Epidemiologic evi-
dence to date, while not completely consistent, suggests that
women with type II diabetes (T2D) have an approximately
20% increased risk of breast cancer (6–10). Uncertainty remains
as to whether the weak associations observed for T2D are partly or
entirely explained by high body mass index (BMI), given that a
high proportion of women with T2D are overweight or obese.
Some prior studies have shown no change in the relative risk
estimate for T2D with control for BMI (6), whereas in others,
control for BMI moved estimates closer to the null (11). The
prevalence of obesity is exceptionally high in African American
(AA) women; in 2013 to 2014 data from the nationally repre-
sentative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES), the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity (BMI � 30
kg/m2) was 57.2% in non-Hispanic black women as compared
with 38.7% in non-Hispanic white women, 46.9% in Hispanic
women, and 12.4% in non-Hispanic Asian women (12). There-
fore, an analysis of T2D and breast cancer risk must carefully
consider potential confounding from BMI.
There have been two reports on the relation of T2D to breast
cancer risk specifically in AA women (11, 13). The first, an early
analysis of Black Women's Health Study (BWHS) data, found no
association (13). The second, in the Multiethnic Cohort, reported
an HR of 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.99–1.33] among
AA women (11). The prevalence of T2D is twice as high in AA
women as in white women (14), making it critical to determine
whether T2D is associated with increased risk of breast cancer in
thispopulation. Further, theetiology ofestrogen receptor negative
(ER�) breast cancer, which disproportionately affects AA women,
differs in some respects from the etiology of ERþ cancer (15–17).
Only a few studies have reported results on T2D and breast cancer
by ER subtype and none has provided such data specifically in AA
women (6, 11). Here we extend previous research in the BWHS by
conducting separate analyses for ERþ and ER� breast cancer in 18
years of follow-up.
Patients and Methods
Study population
The BWHS was established in 1995 when 59,000 AA women
aged 21 to 69 years from across the United States completed
mailed health questionnaires. Participants are followed by bien-
nial questionnaires (18). Follow-up is complete through 2013 for

 87% of person-time since 1995. The Institutional Review Board of
Boston University approved the protocol and reviews the study
annually. The study is carried out in accord with the U.S. Common
Rule. Study participants give informed consent by completing
questionnaires; each questionnaire is accompanied by a cover
letter that details the elements of informed consent.
At baseline, participants were asked about weight (current
and at age 18), height, waist circumference, hip circumference,
number of births, timing of each full-term birth, lactation, age
at menarche, oral contraceptive use, menopausal status, age at
menopause, supplemental female hormone use, breast cancer
in first degree relatives, vigorous physical activity, alcohol
consumption, cigarette smoking, years of education, diagnosis
of T2D, medications used for diabetes, as well as other factors.
Follow-up questionnaires ascertained occurrences of incident
breast cancer and updated information on T2D, weight, and
other variables.
Breast cancer cases
Each BWHS questionnaire asks about new diagnoses of breast
cancer and year of diagnosis. Pathology data are obtained from
hospital medical records and the state cancer registries in 24 states
in which 95% of participants live. Records have been obtained for
approximately 95% of women who reported incident breast
cancers, of which 99% were confirmed. Disconfirmed "cases"
have been excluded. In the early years of the study, 1995 to
2000, testing for ER and progesterone receptors (PR) was not
universal, leading to missing data on ER and PR status for some
participants. We have found that cases with data on receptor status
were similar to cases with unknown receptor status with regard to
the prevalence of known breast cancer risk factors (19). We used
pathology data to classify breast cancers according to SEER stage at
time of diagnosis.
Assessment of T2D and covariates
On baseline and follow-up questionnaires, participants were
asked if they had ever been diagnosed with diabetes, the age at first
diagnosis, and use of injections or pills for diabetes. In a valida-
tion study, 217 of 229 (95%) self-reports of diabetes were con-
firmed by the participants' physicians (20). Given the high accu-
racy of self-report, we accepted self-report to classify participants
as having T2D.
Underdiagnosis of T2D is common in the general popula-
tion, including among African American women; in the most
recent data from NHANES (1999 to 2002), the prevalence of
undiagnosed diabetes among non-Hispanic Black women was
estimated to be 4.1% (14). We estimated prevalence of undi-
agnosed diabetes in the BWHS using blood samples collected
from approximately 25% of BWHS participants in 2013 to
2016. Blood specimens were collected, processed, and tested
by Quest Diagnostics (www.QuestDiagnostics.com), an accre-
dited national clinical laboratory, according to the standards set
by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988
(21). Among the 10,249 participants who had never reported a
diagnosis of T2D, 6.1% had HgA1c levels �6.5%, a level
commonly considered to indicate T2D. Therefore, it is likely
that no more than 6% of participants had undiagnosed T2D.
For the present analyses, participants were classified as users of
T2D medication if they reported use on any of their three most
recent BWHS questionnaires and as nonusers if they did not report
use of medications for treatment of T2D on any of those ques-
tionnaires. Type of medication was classified as "metformin" if
they reported metformin use on any of the three questionnaires
regardless of whether they also used another T2D medication
during that time.
BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height squared
(m2). Weight was updated by questionnaire every two years,
allowing calculation of BMI for each two-year period. Self-
reported waist and hip measures from the 1995 questionnaire
were used to estimate waist–hip ratio.
Women were classified as premenopausal if they reported that
they were still menstruating or had had a hysterectomy with
retention of one or both ovaries and were still under the age of
44 (bottom decile of age at natural menopause in the BWHS).
They were classified as postmenopausal if they reported a natural
menopause (periods stopped at least a year ago), a bilateral
oophorectomy, menopause due to radiation or medication, or
if they had had a hysterectomy with retention of one or both
ovaries and were age 56 or older (top decile of age at natural
menopause in the BWHS).
Statistical analysis
Women who had been diagnosed with cancer before enroll-
ment in 1995 (N ¼ 1,187) were excluded from the analysis.
Women diagnosed with T2D before enrollment in 1995 (N ¼
2,778) were also excluded; they may overrepresent those who are
not susceptible to a possible adverse effect of T2D because they
would have been included in the analysis only if they did not
develop breast cancer in the years between T2D diagnosis and
enrollment.
Each participant contributed person-time from baseline in
1995 until diagnosis of breast cancer, death, loss to follow-up,
or end of follow-up in 2014, whichever came first. Exposure data
for each participant were taken from two questionnaire cycles
before the end of her follow-up. Thus, for a woman with breast
cancer, data on T2D represented her status at least 2 but less than
4 years before diagnosis of the cancer. We used Cox propor-
tional hazards regression, stratified by age and questionnaire
cycle, to calculate HRs and 95% CIs, with adjustment for BMI
(continuous), BMI at age 18 (<20, 20–24, �25 kg/m2), number
of births (0, 1, or 2, �3), age at first birth (<25, �25), age at
menarche (<11, 11, 12–13, �14), first degree family history of
breast cancer (yes, no), oral contraceptive use (never, <5 years
duration, �5 years duration), and use of estrogen with proges-
terone postmenopausal hormones (never, <5 years duration,
�5 years duration). Covariates were updated throughout fol-
low-up. For analyses of ER-specific cancer, women were cen-
sored at the time of diagnosis of any other breast cancer. We
conducted analyses stratified on BMI and waist–hip ratio in
order to disentangle obesity and T2D. We also stratified on
menopausal status because BMI has been shown to have dif-
ferent associations for pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer
(22, 23). We used interaction terms and Wald statistics to test for
multiplicative interaction, and we performed a contrast test to
assess heterogeneity of associations across ER subtypes (24).
Results
The prevalence of T2D in the overall BWHS cohort in 2015
was 19.0%. Among 54,337 women in the analytic cohort, 6,694
were diagnosed with T2D after enrollment in 1995. During
870,358 person-years of follow-up, there were 1,851 incident

 invasive breast cancers, including 914 ERþ and 485 ER� can-
cers. As shown in Table 1, women with T2D were older, had a
higher recent BMI and BMI at age 18, fewer years of education,
earlier age at menarche, and less frequent vigorous physical
activity than nondiabetic women. Frequency of mammographic
screening was high, with 81% of both diabetics and nondia-
betics aged 40 to 69 years having had a recent mammogram.
In age-adjusted analyses, the HR for T2D relative to no T2D
in relation to breast cancer risk was 1.12 (95% CI, 0.95–1.32)
(Table 2). In multivariable analyses, HRs were 1.18 (95% CI,
1.00–1.40) for all T2D and 1.20 (95% CI, 1.00–1.43) for T2D
diagnosed at least 5 years previously. Our models included
both recent BMI and BMI at age 18 in order to account for
possible independent effects. The correlation coefficient for the
two BMI variables was 0.51, and statistical models performed
well with inclusion of both terms. The fully adjusted model
with no BMI terms yielded a HR of 1.16 for T2D and breast
cancer; the HR was increased very slightly to 1.18 or 1.19 with
inclusion of recent BMI alone, BMI at age 18 alone, or both BMI
terms. Results were essentially the same when we repeated the

 analyses with additional control for waist–hip ratio (<75,
75–85, �85) as a measure of central obesity (data not shown).
A positive association with T2D was observed for ER� breast
cancer but not for ERþ cancer: multivariable HRs were 1.43
(95% CI, 1.03–2.00) for ER� breast cancer and 1.02 (95% CI,
0.80–1.31) for ERþ cancer (Table 2). A contrast test to assess
heterogeneity of associations by ER status gave a p-heterogeneity
of 0.11. All other analytic runs were carried out separately for
ERþ and ER� breast cancer.
The positive association of T2D with incidence of ER� breast
cancer was evident at all stages, with HRs of 1.47 (95% CI, 0.87–
2.48) for stage 1, 1.35 (95% CI, 0.76–2.38) for stage 2, and 2.34
(95% CI, 1.15–4.76) for cancer diagnosed at stages 3 or 4 (data
not shown).
For ERþ breast cancer, HRs were close to 1.0 regardless of
whether or not T2D was treated with medication (Table 3).
However, the HR for T2D with metformin was 0.92, whereas the
HR was 1.49 (95% CI, 0.96–2.32) for T2D treated with medica-
tions other than metformin. For ER- breast cancer, HRs were 2.03
(95% CI, 1.13–3.62) for T2D not treated with medication and
1.30 (95% CI, 0.88–1.92) for treatment with diabetes medica-
tions. Results for ER� breast cancer did not differ by type of
medication used. An examination of HgA1c levels among the
subset of diabetic women who provided a blood sample
(n ¼ 2,025) indicated that their T2D was not well-controlled:
only 38% of the women had HgA1c levels below 6.5% and 40%
had levels �7.0%. HgA1c levels were highest in women who
reported use of diabetes medications, with only 32% below 6.5%
and 47% �7.0%.
Table 4 presents results on both T2D and BMI within strata of
menopausal status. Associations of T2D with ERþ cancer were
close to the null in both pre- and postmenopausal women
(Pinteraction ¼ 0.95). T2D was associated with ER- breast cancer
among premenopausal women (HR2.39, 95% CI 1.30–4.39),but
not among postmenopausal women (Pinteraction ¼ 0.13). Higher
BMI was associated with increased risk of ERþ breast cancer
in postmenopausal women but not premenopausal women
(Pinteraction ¼ 0.02), whereas there was no association of BMI
with risk of ER� breast cancer in either group.
To disentangle associations of obesity and T2D with breast
cancer risk, we repeated the T2D analyses within strata of BMI
(<30, �30 kg/m2) and waist–hip ratio (<0.85, �0.85; Table 5).
T2D was not associated with increased risk of ERþ breast cancer in
any subgroup of BMI or waist-hip ratio. For ER� breast cancer,

 however, T2D was associated with increased risk among women
with BMI <30 (HR 1.92; 95% CI, 1.22–3.04) but not among
women with BMI �30 (Pinteraction ¼ 0.05). A positive association
of T2D with risk of ER- breast cancer was also observed among
women with waist-hip ratio <0.85 (HR 1.55, 95% CI, 0.99–2.45),
whereas the comparable estimate was smaller, 1.26, and not
statistically significant among women with waist–hip ratio
�0.85 (Pinteraction ¼ 0.40).
Discussion
The present analysis, from a large cohort of AA women, suggests
that women with T2D have a 40% increased risk of developing
ER� breast cancer. The association was observed primarily among
women who were not obese. T2D was not associated with
incidence of ERþ breast cancer.
Meta-analyses of T2D and risk of overall breast cancer have
shown an approximately 20% increased risk associated with
T2D (7, 8). Two large individual studies have been published
since the most recent meta-analysis (9, 11). The first, which
linked electronic medical records from a health maintenance
organization in Israel with registry data, reported that the HR
for incident T2D diagnosed 2 to 11 years before the end of
follow-up was 1.29 (1.22–1.36) in postmenopausal women,
whereas the comparable HR in premenopausal women was
1.02 (9). The other, based on data from the Multiethnic Cohort
Study (MEC), reported an HR of 1.08 (95% CI, 1.00–1.16)
across all ethnic groups (11). In MEC, analyses stratified by
race/ethnicity, the only statistically significant association was
in Latina women; the HR in AA women was 1.14 (95% CI,
0.99–1.33).
Two previous studies have reported results separately by ER
subtype (6, 11). Both reported similar associations with ERþ
and ER� breast cancer, with no evidence of a stronger associ-
ation with ER� cancer. The MEC did not provide ER-specific
results by race/ethnicity (11). Three case-only cross-sectional
studies reported on breast tumor characteristics according to
T2D status (25–27) and all three reported a higher proportion
of ER� relative to ERþ tumors among diabetics as compared
with nondiabetics among premenopausal women. In this study,
associations with ER� cancer were stronger among premeno-
pausal women. Most previous case–control and cohort studies
have not had adequate power to assess associations among
premenopausal
women
because
T2D,
until
recently,
has
occurred primarily among postmenopausal women or women
close to menopause. For example, in a report from the Nurses'
Health Study based on 5,189 incident cases of breast cancer,
only 14 incident breast cancer cases occurred among premen-
opausal women with T2D (6). Among AA women, T2D occurs
at younger ages and more frequently (14); nevertheless, in this
analysis, there were only 24 premenopausal cases with T2D and
the higher HRs observed in premenopausal versus postmeno-
pausal women may be a chance finding.
Metformin, an oral biguanide that increases insulin sensitivity
and improves glycemic control, was introduced in the early 1990s
and is now the most widely used oral medication for T2D (28, 29).
In Women's Health Initiative clinical trial data, there was no
association of T2D with incidence of invasive breast cancer overall
(30). However, relative to nondiabetics, there was an increased
incidence (HR 1.16; 95% CI, 0.93–1.45) for women taking
medications other than metformin and a reduced incidence (HR
0.75; 95% CI, 0.57–0.99) in women taking metformin. That
pattern was observed for both ERþ/PRþ breast cancer and
ER�/PR� breast cancer, with a stronger association for ER�/PR�
breast cancer: HR 1.78; 95% CI, 1.05–3.03, for nonusers of
metformin. Our findings are somewhat consistent. Relative to
nondiabetics, diabetics who used medications other than met-
formin had a 40% increased risk of both ERþ and ER� breast
cancer, whereas HRs for those who used metformin were lower:
0.92 for ERþ and 1.26 for ER- breast cancer. In addition, diabetics
who reported no diabetes medication use had a two-fold risk of
ER� breast cancer. However, the BWHS findings regarding med-
ication use were based on small numbers of cases and the only
statistically significant association was a two-fold risk of ER�
cancer for T2D without medication use. The stronger association
observed for T2D not treated with medication appears to lend
support to the hypothesis that uncontrolled disease influences
breast cancer development through metabolic pathways. How-
ever, diabetic women who are not being treated with medications
tend to have less severe disease. Indeed, among the approximately
2,000 diabetic women in the BWHS who gave a recent blood
sample, those who had never taken diabetes medications had
lower levels of HgA1c than did those who reported using diabetes
medications.

 A concern in previous research on T2D and breast cancer
risk is potential confounding by BMI given that high BMI is
the major contributing cause of T2D and a risk factor for
postmenopausal ERþ breast cancer. Even when BMI is included
in regression models, there is a potential for residual confound-
ing because of measurement error. In the present study, adjust-
ment for BMI changed the estimates only slightly, and away
from the null rather than closer to the null, suggesting that BMI
was not a material confounder.
The present research was prompted, in part, by the emerging
concept of "metabolically healthy obesity" (31, 32). We
hypothesized that T2D may lead to an increased risk of breast
cancer, and especially to ER� breast cancer, independent of
obesity, through mechanisms unrelated to steroid hormones
(e.g., inflammation). Our results from analyses stratified on
obesity and waist–hip ratio lend support to the hypothesis. T2D
was associated with a 92% increased risk of ER� breast cancer
among nonobese women and a 55% increased risk among
women with waist–hip ratio <0.85. A study of Asian American
women found a similar pattern for all breast cancer: T2D was
more strongly associated with breast cancer risk among women
in the lowest BMI category and among women in the lowest
waist–hip ratio category (33). A recent analysis of Women's
Health Initiative data classified women as to metabolic status
using data on insulin resistance (i.e., HOMA-IR) or fasting insu-
lin level and examined breast cancer risk according to cross-
classification of metabolic health and normal versus overweight
status (32). Compared with women who were metabolically
healthy and of normal weight, women classified as metaboli-
cally unhealthy were at increased risk of breast cancer regardless
of their BMI; women who were overweight but apparently
metabolically healthy were not at increased risk (32).
Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain associa-
tions of T2D with breast cancer risk (5, 34). Perhaps of most
relevance to the current findings of increased risk of ER� cancer,
the dysregulated glucose metabolism experienced by diabetics can
lead to a chronic proinflammatory condition with associated
oxidative stress and promotion of tumor initiation and progres-
sion (35, 36). In a chronic inflammatory state, there are typically
high levels of proinflammatory cytokines (37), reductions in
adiponectin (38), and infiltration of adipose depots with immune
cells, notably proinflammatory macrophages (39). These adipose
tissue macrophages secrete cytokines that promote insulin resis-
tance in adipocytes (40) and are identifiable histologically as
CD68þ "crown-like" structures that encircle stressed or dead
adipocytes (41, 42). Evidence is accumulating that chemokines
and cytokines of the breast adipose microenvironment, such as
IL6 (43), promote carcinogenic processes in epithelial cells
(44), including increased cell proliferation (45) and survival
(46), and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in early stage
breast cancer cells (47, 48).
Increased mammographic screening in diabetic women is an
unlikely explanation for the present results as the positive asso-
ciation of T2D with risk of ER� breast cancer was evident regard-
less of stage at diagnosis. In addition, a high proportion of BWHS
participants over the age of 40 reported regular screening.
Potential limitations include reliance on self-report rather
than medical records for exposure status. However, misclassi-
fication of T2D status was likely to be small; a validation study
of self-reported diabetes yielded a positive predictive value of
over 95% and estimates from within the BWHS and U.S.
population data indicate that only 4% to 6% of African Amer-
ican women who have not been diagnosed with T2D actually
have HgA1c levels above the cut-point used to indicate T2D.
Misclassification of T2D status would weaken associations
between T2D and breast cancer risk, meaning that the observed
associations with risk of ER- breast cancer may underestimate
the true association. As further reassurance on the validity of
T2D classification in the BWHS, we note that the BWHS has
published numerous papers on risk factors for T2D that have
identified associations consistent with the literature (49, 50). A
more important limitation is the lack of statistical power for
robust analyses of medication use for T2D. Although our
analyses included 6,694 women with T2D, our ability to make
inferences about the intriguing results on use of metformin and
other medications was limited by the relatively small numbers
of users in each category.
In conclusion, findings from the present study suggest that AA
women with T2D are at increased risk of developing ER- breast
cancer and that poor metabolic health may be more important
than BMI for ER� disease. Given that the prevalence of T2D is
twice as high in non-Hispanic blacks as in non-Hispanic whites
(14), the observed association, if confirmed, may explain in part
why AA women have a disproportionately high incidence of ER-
breast cancer compared to U.S. white women. Whether adequate
treatment with metformin or other medications can ameliorate
the increased risk associated with diabetes requires further
research.
