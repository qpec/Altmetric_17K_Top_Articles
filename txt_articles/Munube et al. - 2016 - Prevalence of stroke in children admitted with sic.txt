Abstract
Background: Stroke is a major complication of sickle cell anaemia (SCA). It occurs commonly in childhood with
about 10 % of children with sickle cell anaemia getting affected by this complication. In Uganda, there is paucity
of data on the prevalence of stroke in children admitted in a tertiary institution. We determined the prevalence of
stroke amongst children with SCA admitted to Mulago National Referral Hospital in Uganda and described the ir
co-morbidities.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective record review of children with SCA admitted from August 2012 to August
2014 to the Paediatric Haematology Ward of Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. The target population was SCA
children age 6 months-17 years of age. A descriptive analysis was used to summarize the demographic
characteristics and clinical diagnosis.
Results: There were 2,176 children with SCA admitted who were included in this study. There were 147 children
with stroke. Their mean age 6.1, (SD 3), with a male to female ratio was 1:1 (71 males and 76 females). The M: F
ratio of non-stroke children was 1.1:1 (1084 males and 945 females) with a mean age of 5.2, (SD 3). The prevalence
of stroke was 6.8 % (147 of 2176). Amongst the children with stroke, 72.1 % (106 of 147) had co-morbidities which
included severe anaemia 21.7 % (23 of 106), bacteraemia and vaso-occlusive crisis 17 % (18 of 106),
pneumonia
8.4 % (9 of 106) and malaria 6.6 % (7 of 106).
Conclusion: The prevalence of stroke in hospitalized Ugandan children with SCA was 6.8 %. Children with stroke were
often admitted with other medical conditions such as severe anaemia, bacteraemia and vaso-occlusion.

Background
Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is a common genetic condi-
tion due to a haemoglobin (Hb) disorder inheritance of
mutant haemoglobin genes from both parents. It is esti-
mated that 30 million persons are affected with SCA [1].
It is a major health problem and the most common
inheritable disease in Africa. Approximately 60 % of
individuals with SCA live in Sub Saharan Africa. Each
year about 300,000 infants are born with major haemo-
globin disorders- including more than 200,000 cases of
SCA in Africa [1].
Stroke as a complication of SCA affects 6 to 17 % of
children and young adults worldwide [2]. The risk of
stroke is highest during the first decade of life and it is
most significant between the ages of 2 and 5 years [3].
Approximately 10 % of patients will have a stroke by the
age of 20 [3]. Stroke subtypes vary by age in SCD
patients. The incidence of the ischaemic stroke, which con-
stitutes 54 % of all strokes in SCA, is highest during the
first decade of life and after age 30. Haemorrhagic stroke is
more common among individuals in their 20s [2].
A child with SCA has a stroke risk that is 333 times
greater than that of a healthy child without SCA or heart
disease [3]. The landmark STOP trial by Adams et al. in
1998 found that primary stroke can be prevented by
chronic transfusions after identifying children at risk

 using a transcranial Doppler (TCD) screening of the
anterior or middle cerebral arteries [4]. As a result of
this finding, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Insti-
tute recommend that TCD screening must be used as a
modality to identify children at risk for stroke [5]. Subse-
quent stroke incidence studies by Fullerton et al. in the
USA which have assessed the impact of chronic blood
transfusion in children who have been identified by TCD
screening have shown a decline in annual rates of stroke
[6]. In Uganda TCD screening is not available for the
population of children with SCA.
Despite SCA being common in Uganda [7], data is
lacking regarding the prevalence of stroke in children
with SCA admitted. We conducted a retrospective chart
review of children admitted with SCA and determined
the prevalence of stroke. In addition, we described the
medical co-morbidities in the same children with stroke
in Mulago Hospital, Kampala.
Methods
Overview
This was a retrospective study, conducted at Mulago Hos-
pital, the main National Referral and Teaching Hospital
for Makerere University College of Health Sciences in
Kampala, Uganda. A single reviewer extracted all the re-
cords of all children with SCA aged <18 years admitted to
the Haematology Ward of Mulago Hospital during the
study period from August 2012 to August 2014. In
Uganda, there is no policy for routine sickle cell testing
such as newborn screening. Children with symptoms and
signs of sickle cell disease are tested. The confirmation of
SCA was by Hb electrophoresis. Some of the children
would have been tested during the infancy period when
signs of SCD emerge and others are tested based on their
clinical presentation to the hospital. In addition, some
children were tested for SCD based on the presentation of
a stroke. A standardized data collection sheet was used to
collect information on demographic characteristics (name,
age, sex, address) and clinical diagnosis, which included
information on the diagnosis and other medical condi-
tions in these children on admission. The data was
cleaned to identify any duplication of patients. In Mulago
Hospital, each patient is given a unique admission number
and on subsequent admissions the same number is issued.
In addition, the old file of the patient was retrieved were
possible to include the new details of the admission. The
first stroke admission was included in the analysis. Re-
peated admissions of the same patient with stroke were
excluded. In cases where the admission number was not
indicated these cases were also excluded.
Setting
In Uganda, Mulago Hospital is the National Referral
hospital where patients with SCA are referred from
other peripheral health facilities.. In the Acute care unit
(ACU) of the paediatric department, we admit 7 to 10
children with sickle cell disease per day for an acute cri-
sis. They are initially stabilized in the ACU and later
transferred on a daily basis to the haematology ward of
the hospital. In addition, the hospital has a SCA day care
clinic which cares for the children with SCA. The clinic’s
average attendance is 50 to 70 clients per day. They re-
ceive their routine medications and some interventions
such as blood transfusions, intravenous antibiotics, and
parenteral analgesics. Hydroxyurea is not registered for
use in Uganda for people living with SCA.
Stroke management in Mulago Hospital: Children with
SCA who are admitted with a clinical diagnosis of stroke
are given a simple transfusion to raise the haemoglobin
level up to 10 g/dl. Imaging such as CT scan and MRI/
MRA are not accessible because of the cost associated
with the tests. All radiological investigations are paid for
at a cost to the patients in the hospital. The hospital
only has a single CT scan machine and does not have an
MRI machine. All cases of stroke are diagnosed using
clinical symptoms and signs. As a result, the attending
physician/paediatrician depends on their clinical skills to
determine whether the patient has an ishaemic or hae-
morraghic stroke. In the event that the brain imaging is
available, it usually is done well after 24 to 48 h of
admission to the hospital. The children who suffer a
stroke are offered a chronic transfusion program which
involves a monthly visit to the sickle cell clinic for
review and a simple blood transfusion. However, the
biggest challenge is the lack of a reliable supply of blood
to the clinic. This is because of the high demand for
blood products to treat other conditions such as severe
malaria anaemia, haematological malignancies, road traf-
fic accidents and obstetric emergencies in the hospital
and country at large.
Operational definitions
Primary diagnosis
This was considered as the first problem registered by
the clinician on the admission record.
Secondary diagnosis
This was considered as the second problem registered
by the clinician on the admission record.
Severe anaemia
This was defined using the World Health Organization
classification as a haemoglobin concentration of less
than 7 g/dl [8].
Stroke
This was defined using the World Health Organization
definition of stroke: “rapidly developing clinical signs of

 focal (or global) disturbance of cerebral function, with
symptoms lasting 24 h or longer or leading to death with
no apparent cause other than of vascular origin [9].
Study variables
Data was extracted from the hospital medical record
books using a standardized questionnaire. The informa-
tion included socio-demographic characteristics such as:
age, sex, tribe, address and clinical diagnosis such as pri-
mary and secondary diagnoses where applicable. The
diagnosis extracted was based on the decision made by
the attending team on discharge of the patient. In the
event more than one diagnosis was made, we sub-
divided them into a primary diagnosis and a secondary
diagnosis.
Data analysis
All data was entered into Microsoft excel and analysis
was done using the same software. The prevalence was
calculated as the proportion of observation units that
ever exhibited the state of interest, including those units
that already exhibited the state during the period of
study. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics
including proportions and percentages.
Results
A total of 2,870 records were extracted. Of which 2,176
records were included in the analysis as shown in Fig. 1.
All children with stroke were diagnosed by clinical
symptoms and signs using the WHO definition of a clin-
ical stroke. The male to female ratio of children with
stroke was 1:1 (71 males, 76 females). The M: F ratio of
non-stroke children was 1.1:1 (1084 males and 945
females). A total of 147 patients had a diagnosis of
stroke. The prevalence of stroke was 6.8 % (147 of
2176). The mean age of patients with stroke was 6.1 years
(SD 3). The mean age of non-stroke children was 5.2,
(SD 3). The age distribution of patients with stroke
showed that 91.1 % (134 of147) of children were less
than 10 years of age. The age group of greater than 5 to
10 years comprised the largest percentage of 44.9 % (66
of 147) as shown in Table 1. The age distribution of the
non-stroke patients is shown in Table 1. Amongst the
147 patients with stroke, 27.9 % (41 of 147) presented
with a stroke as a primary diagnosis, while 72.1 % (106
of 147) presented with stroke and a secondary diagnosis.
The

co-morbidities

were
severe
anaemia, 21.7 % (23 of106); bacteraemia, 17 % (18 of
106); and vaso-occlusive crisis, 17 % (18 of 106). Other
co-morbidities are shown in Table 2. The major reason

 for admission for children with SCA without stroke was
a vaso-occlusive crisis. The rest of the other causes are
shown in Table 3. Among the children with stroke, all
were managed with simple transfusions to raise their Hb
level up to 10 g/dl according to the department of paedi-
atrics sickle cell stroke protocol. It should be noted that
only four children with stroke had been started on
hydroxurea. All the children had been started on the
medication after suffering a primary or recurrent stroke.
Discussion
In this study, we have determined the prevalence of
stroke in children admitted in the haematology ward of
Mulago Hospital. We found that the prevalence of
stroke in children admitted to our paediatric haematol-
ogy ward was 6.8 %. This is similar to other studies done
in other parts of Africa such as Cameroun and Nigeria
[10, 11]. It is also similar to the earlier reported preva-
lence in North America before the introduction of inter-
ventions which have led to a decrease in the prevalence
of stroke in the developed world [3, 12].
There was an equal male to female ratio in our study
population. This was in contrast to a study by Balkaran
et al. in Jamaica which showed a higher incidence of
stroke in boys [12].
The majority of children with SCA and stroke in our
sample were between the ages 2 to 10 years. This is
similar to other reports by Ohene-Frempong et al. in the
USA and George et al. in Nigeria where they docu-
mented the occurrence of stroke in children with SCA
in the age bracket of 2 to 10 years [3, 13]. We also noted
that the majority of our children were aged 5 to 10. This
contrasts with studies by Ohene-Frempong et al. in
Philadelphia and Balkaran et al. in Jamaica who both
followed up children from infancy up to childhood. They
reported an earlier occurrence between the ages of 2 to
5 years of age for stroke in their populations [3, 12]. This
difference could be explained by a healthy survivor
effect. Most children in Uganda with SCA die by their
fifth birthday [14]. Those who survive by natural selec-
tion or who have more access to care and treatment
develop their complications at a later period in their
lifetime.
In this study, we found that 72.1 % of our children
with
stroke
had
co-morbidities.
The
common
co-
morbidities included severe anaemia, bacteraemia and
vaso-occlusive crisis. This was similar to studies by
Kehinde et al. and Amayo et al. [11, 15]. They noted that
in their respective centers, children who presented with
a stroke had other infections or conditions at the time of
presentation. In 1978, Powars et al. found that children
with severe anaemia and bacteraemia where at a higher

 risk for stroke [2]. Currently, in North America these
conditions are not as common because of the introduc-
tion of pneumococcal vaccination. In Uganda, we still
have high incidences of severe bacterial infections due to
lack
of
appropriate
preventative
interventions
[16].
There is poor access to penicillin prophylaxis, lack of
access to pneumococcal vaccination for children with
sickle cell disease (SCD) and also lack of dedicated sickle
cell clinic’s outside of Mulago hospital to provide the
necessary care to this high risk group. In Uganda, we
have only one dedicated sickle cell clinic and day care
centre which is located within Mulago National Referral
Hospital. There is no transcranial Doppler screening
program in the country for children with sickle cell
anaemia.
We describe for the first time the prevalence of
stroke in our population of children with SCA. We
also describe some co-morbid conditions that the
children with stroke may present with. The know-
ledge of the prevalence of stroke in our population of
children with SCA will strengthen the need to pro-
vide comprehensive care for children with SCA. This
will include early identification of children at risk for
stroke using transcranial Doppler screening and the
provision of chronic transfusion for those at risk to
prevent stroke occurrence [17]. The burden of SCD
in Uganda is high with an estimated 245,000 babies
born with SCD per year [7]. With such a large popu-
lation and our prevalence rate of 6.8 %. We postulate
that the introduction of a TCD program in Uganda
will prevent 8,000 new stroke cases per year.
There are several strengths to this retrospective study.
There were a large number of children with sickle cell
anaemia who were admitted to Mulago hospital during
the study period. The haematology ward is where the
children with SCA are admitted. It was established in
2012 as a means of improving care of children with
haematological disorders. Prior to that year, the children
were admitted all over the existing wards of the paediat-
ric directorate. Mulago Hospital is a national referral
centre and thus most children with complications of
sickle cell disease such as stroke would be referred to
the hospital.
This study has some limitations. This was a retro-
spective study which relied on already existing patient
records. We selected only those charts that had all
the information required for abstraction. This being a
hospital based study; we acknowledge that not all
children with sickle cell stroke will be admitted to
Mulago hospital being a tertiary unit in an urban
area. In addition, not all children with SCA would be
cared for at this facility. In Uganda, there is no estab-
lished national ambulance service for referral of pa-
tients from all areas of the country. This may prevent
the referral of other children with stroke to the facil-
ity. However, the findings are a representative of chil-
dren
with
SCA
presenting
to
a
national
referral
center in Uganda.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the prevalence of stroke in admitted chil-
dren with SCA was 6.8 % in Uganda. Co-morbidity was
a common finding in these children. We recommend
introduction
of
trans-cranial
Doppler
screening
in
Uganda as a modality to identify those who may be at
risk of stroke to prevent its occurrence. This study is
part of a larger sickle cell anaemia stroke study which is
looking to identify risk factors for stroke in children with
SCA in Mulago Hospital. These results have led the
department of paediatrics and child health at Mulago
Hospital to plan for the introduction of transcranial
Doppler screening in the hospital. In addition, future
community based studies should be carried out to deter-
mine the incidence of stroke in children with SCA.
