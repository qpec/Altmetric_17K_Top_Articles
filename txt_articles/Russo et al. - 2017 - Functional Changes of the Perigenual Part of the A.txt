Objective: To explore the functional reorganization of the pain processing network 
during trigeminal heat stimulation (THS) after 60 days of external trigeminal neurostimu-
lation (eTNS) in migraine without aura (MwoA) patients between attacks.
Methods: Using whole-brain BOLD-fMRI, functional response to THS at two different 
intensities (41 and 51°C) was investigated interictally in 16 adults MwoA patients before 
and after eTNS with the Cefaly® device. We calculated the percentage of patients having 
at least a 50% reduction of monthly migraine attacks and migraine days between base-
line and the last month of eTNS. Secondary analyses evaluated associations between 
BOLD signal changes and clinical features of migraine.
results: Before eTNS treatment, there was no difference in BOLD response between 
MwoA patients and healthy controls (HC) during low-innocuous THS at 41°C, whereas 
the perigenual part of the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) revealed a greater BOLD 
response to noxious THS at 51°C in MwoA patients when compared to HC. The same 
area demonstrated a significant reduced BOLD response induced by the noxious THS 
in MwoA patients after eTNS (p = 0.008). Correlation analyses showed a significant 
positive correlation between ACC BOLD response to noxious THS before eTNS treat-
ment and the decrease of ACC BOLD response to noxious THS after eTNS. Moreover, a 
significant negative correlation in the migraine group after eTNS treatment between ACC 
functional activity changes and both the perceived pain ratings during noxious THS and 
pre-treatment migraine attack frequency has been found.
conclusion: Our findings suggest that eTNS treatment with the Cefaly® device induces 
a functional antinociceptive modulation in the ACC that is involved in the mechanisms 
underlying its preventive anti-migraine efficacy. Nevertheless, further observations to 
confirm whether the observed fMRI effects of eTNS are both related to clinical improve-
ment and specific to antinociceptive modulation in migraine patients are mandatory.

Brain Functional Changes after eTNS in Migraine

inTrODUcTiOn
Migraine is the most prevalent neurological disorder worldwide 
and ranked sixth among the leading causes of years lived with 
disability (1). Unfortunately, migraine is not curable and most 
preventive pharmacotherapies are characterized by a relatively 
low efficacy and disabling adverse effects. There is thus a need for 
more effective and better tolerated treatments. Recently, based 
on new insights in migraine and pain pathophysiology, non- 
invasive neurostimulation therapies have raised much interest 
(2) Among them, interventions targeting pericranial nerves have 
become part of the preventive armamentarium (3).
In particular, external trigeminal neurostimulation (eTNS) 
with the Cefaly® device has demonstrated a very favorable 
efficacy/safety profile in migraine patients (4), when compared 
with that of preventive anti-migraine drugs (5), although com-
parisons with other neuromodulation approaches are lacking, 
to date. Besides in a randomized controlled clinical trial (4), 
the beneficial effects of eTNS for migraine prevention were 
confirmed in a large survey (6) and in a recent open-label trial 
(7). More recently, a fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission 
tomography (FDG-PET) study showed that eTNS with the 
Cefaly® device was able to increase activity in crucial areas of 
the limbic system and salience matrix such as orbitofrontal 
(OF) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in migraine patients 
responding to the treatment (8). This suggests that eTNS may 
be able to modulate neuronal circuits involved in the descend-
ing pain control of trigeminovascular nociceptors in the spinal 
trigeminal nucleus (3). Direct proof, however, of an eTNS-
induced change in trigeminal nociceptive processing is lacking. 
We decided therefore to explore with whole-brain BOLD fMRI 
the functional reorganization of the pain processing network 
during trigeminal heat stimulation (THS) after 60 days of eTNS 
with the Cefaly® device in migraine without aura (MwoA) 
patients between attacks.
We hypothesized that eTNS would induce a functional 
reorganization of the trigeminal pain-processing network and 
increase activity of central antinociceptive mechanisms in MwoA 
patients.
MaTerials anD MeThODs
subjects
We enrolled 20 patients suffering from MwoA according to the 
criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders 
(ICHD-3 beta version, code 1.1) (9) with a low frequency of 
attacks (≤5 attacks/month). Ten of these patients had previously 
participated in our study exploring the clinical efficacy of eTNS 
(6). All patients were right-handed and had a normal neurological 
examination. The patients had never taken migraine-preventive 
drugs in the course of their life. Exclusion criteria were the pres-
ence of any other ICHD-III diagnosis (e.g., tension type head-
ache, chronic migraine, etc.), somatic or psychiatric conditions, 
or intake of daily medications. Only patients compliant with the 
eTNS therapy were included in the final analysis. Compliance was 
defined as use of the device for ≥800 min during the 60-day treat-
ment period (i.e., ≥2/3 of the total time expected) and according 
to neurostimulation pattern of preventive parameters. Based on 
this criterion, two patients were excluded from the final statistical 
analysis. Moreover, two additional patients were excluded due to 
movement artifacts during the fMRI scan. To avoid any possible 
attack- or treatment-related interference, patients were pain free 
during the fMRI recording and had not taken any acute migraine 
drug for at least 3 days before the scanning. They were interviewed 
by telephone 3 days after the MRI scan to ascertain that they were 
also migraine free during this period.
Sixteen right-handed subjects with a comparable age- and 
sex distribution were recruited as healthy controls (HC) via 
advertisements placed in the hospital (e.g., posters and flyers), 
via word-of-mouth referrals, and from a database of research 
volunteers maintained by the MRI Research Center of the Second 
University of Naples (Table 1). All subjects underwent prelimi-
nary MRI examination before entering the present study.

eTns Treatment and clinical Outcome 
Measures
The study was conducted between January 2013 and February 2015.
After a 28-day baseline without preventive treatment, patients 
applied daily during 20 min the Cefaly® device for 60 days. They 
were instructed how to apply the device and to use stimulation

protocol 2 (pulse frequency 60 Hz, max intensity 16 mA) and 
returned to the clinic for a final evaluation at the end of the eTNS 
treatment period. An in-built electronic system allowed to moni-
tor the time of use of the device and the correct parameters of 
neurostimulation for each patient (see above).
Frequency of migraine attacks and migraine days per month, 
mean pain intensity during attacks using the VAS score (0: no 
pain; 10: severe pain totally prohibiting daily activities) and 
impact on daily life (HIT-6 score) (10) as well as monthly intake 
of rescue medication were measured with paper headache 
diaries during a 28-day pre-treatment baseline and during the 
60 days of eTNS with the Cefaly® device (Table 1). Clinical 
features such as disease duration and disability (MIDAS score) 
were obtained from the patients when they entered the study. 
A migraine day was defined as a day with headache fulfilling 
ICHD-III beta version criteria for MwoA (9), except for dura-
tion, if the attack was treated. Migraine days not separated by 
at least one headache-free day were considered to belong to the 
same migraine attack. We measured the percentage change in 
headache parameters between baseline and the last month of 
eTNS and calculated the percentage of patients having at least a 
50% reduction of monthly migraine attacks and migraine days.
JMP software (Version 11, SAS Institute Inc., NC, USA) 
was used to perform the statistical analysis on the clinical data. 
Continuous data were expressed as means ± SEs and compared 
using the paired t-test or Wilcoxon matched pairs signed-rank 
test where appropriate. Statistical significance was defined as 
p < 0.05.
Trigeminal heat stimulation
Heat stimuli were applied using the contact heat-evoked poten-
tial stimulator (CHEPS) (Medoc Ltd, Ramat Yishai, Israel). The 
CHEPS device has an MRI-compatible thermode with an area 
of 572.5 mm2 and a heating thermo-foil (Minco Products, Inc., 
Minneapolis, MN, USA), covered with a 25 mm layer of thermo 
conductive plastic (Kapton®, thermal conductivity at 23°C of 
0.1–0.35 W/m/K). It is characterized by a rapid rising time to 
high temperatures (up to 70°C/s) suited to study thermonocicep-
tive pathways. Patients were tested on the cheek on the side more 
frequently affected during migraine attacks, whereas HC were 
matched with regard to the side of the face tested in migraine 
patients. We compared a low innocuous stimulus at 41°C 
 
(11, 12) and a noxious stimulus at 51°C (11, 12). To minimize 
 
the effects of habituation and expectation, all experimental 
stimuli were delivered at random.
Functional Magnetic resonance imaging 
Parameters and Pre-Processing
The fMRI imaging parameters and pre-processing used in the 
present study were described in detail previously (11, 12). Briefly, 
MRI was performed on a 3-T scanner (Signa HDxt, GE Healthcare, 
USA) equipped with an eight-channel parallel head coil. Each 
fMRI scan consisted of 300 volumes of a repeated gradient-echo 
echo planar imaging sequence. Three-dimensional T1-weighted 
images (FSPGR BRAVO sequence) and T2-fluid-attenuated 
inversion recovery sequence was also acquired in all subjects.
Functional image time-courses were processed using the 
software package BrainVoyager QX (Brain Innovation, The 
Netherlands). All the scans were re-aligned to the first included 
volume scan using a Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm in order 
to correct for movement artifacts. Then, the motion parameters 
were carefully inspected to control that no excessive residual 
motion (>1 functional voxel) was present. Using the results of 
the image registration with three-dimensional anatomical scans, 
the functional image time series were warped into Talairach space 
and resampled into 3-mm isotropic voxel time series. Finally, to 
perform a group-level analysis, the resampled volume time series 
were spatially filtered (smoothing) using a 6-mm full-width-at-
half-maximum Gaussian kernel.
experimental Protocol
Migraine patients, before eTNS treatment, and HC underwent 
two consecutive fMRI sessions for each of the two THS stimuli 
(41 and 51°C) according to a previously reported event-related 
experimental design (11, 12). In each fMRI session, 600 ms THS 
was applied to the maxillary skin at two different temperatures 
(41 and 51°C) with a jittered inter-stimulus interval of 14 ± 1 s 
(total session duration 7 min 45 s). Prior to the fMRI record-
ings, outside the scanner, migraine patients and HC were fully 
informed about the characteristics of the applied thermal heat 
stimuli. After each fMRI session, there was a delay of about 30 s 
during which subjects, inside the scanner, had to verbally rate 
the perceived pain induced by the heat stimulus on a numerical 
rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (“no pain”) to 10 (“worst pain 
imaginable”).
After the 60-day eTNS treatment migraine patients under-
went an additional fMRI session similar to the pre-treatment 
session described above.
statistical analysis
The description of statistical analysis used in the present study 
was described in detail previously (11, 12). The variance of 
all image time series was estimated voxel-wise according to a 
random-effects convolution-based general linear model analysis 
(13). For each subject, the two fMRI time series corresponding 
to the two separate sessions were temporally normalized to z 
scores and concatenated before entering the general linear 
model (GLM) fitting (see below). Two “event-type” GLM predic-
tors of interest encoding the responses to the two stimulus types 
(41 and 51°C) were defined using the double-gamma function 
as hemodynamic input function for the linear convolution. For 
each subject and each voxel included in the slab of imaging, the 
“beta” weights of all regressors were estimated according to a 
GLM fit–refit procedure.
To draw population-level inferences from statistical maps, 
the two beta estimates for the predictors of interest at each voxel 
entered a second-level analysis of variance with subjects treated 
as random observations (random effects analysis of variance 
ANOVA). Two ANOVA models were calculated: in the first 
model, at each voxel, a two-way ANOVA table was calculated, 
with one within-subject factor for the “temperature” effect and 
one between-subject factor for the MwoA effect; in the second

model, at each voxel, a two-way ANOVA table was calculated with 
one within-subject factor for the “temperature” effect and one 
within-subject factor for the eTNS treatment in MwoA patients.
From the computed ANOVA tables, contrast t-maps for the 
main effects of THS as well as for the two-group and one-group 
(MwoA before treatment > MwoA after treatment) differential 
effects were computed and overlaid on the Talairach-normalized 
high-resolution “Colin-27” template.
To localize the regions with statistically significant effects, a 
threshold was applied to the t-maps, which protected against 
false-positive voxels at 5% (corrected for multiple comparisons). 
In order to correct functional clusters for multiple comparisons, 
a cluster-level threshold was applied to the maps that protected 
against false-positive clusters at 5% (cluster-level corrected 
for multiple comparisons). More specifically, starting from an 
(uncorrected) voxel-level threshold of p = 0.005, a whole-brain 
correction approach based on Monte Carlo simulations was used 
to define the minimum cluster size (14).
To test for possible eTNS effects in the group of MwoA patients 
as well as for correlations between regional BOLD responses 
to THS and clinical scores (i.e., disease duration, migraine 
frequency, average of pain intensity of migraine attacks, MIDAS 
and HIT-6), a region of interest (ROI) was functionally defined 
from clusters exhibiting statistically significant group effects in 
the voxel-based analysis and ROI-GLM estimates for the predic-
tors of interest were calculated for each MwoA patient and each 
scan (before and after eTNS). The obtained ROI-GLM estimates 
were scaled to BOLD percent signal change and both used in 
one-sample paired t-test to statistically assess the effect of eTNS 
treatment in MwoA patients and correlated with the individual 
clinical scores. In addition to functionally defined ROIs, an 
extra ROI was anatomically defined in the pons. We chose the 
location based on our previous findings in another population of 
migraineurs (11) as well as on previous neuroimaging observa-
tions in migraine patients (15).
resUlTs
clinical Data
Based on patients’ diaries, between baseline and the end of 60-day 
tSNS treatment (concerning the last month of treatment), we 
observed a statistically significant decrease in monthly frequency 
of migraine attacks (p < 0.001) and migraine days (p < 0.001) 
and a consequent reduced monthly intake of rescue medication 
(p < 0.001) (Figure 1A). Furthermore, mean pain intensity dur-
ing attacks (p = 0.01) (Figure 1B) and the HIT-6 score (p < 0.001) 
(Figure 1C) were reduced at the end of the treatment. In line with 
our previous study (6), 81% of patients showed a reduction of at 
least 50% of migraine attacks and at least 75% of migraine days 
after eTNS treatment.
Pain ratings
Mean intensity of perceived pain (NRS) was not significantly dif-
ferent between MwoA patients before eTNS treatment and HC 
neither at 41°C (p = 0.54) nor at 51°C (p = 0.55). Similarly, pain 
ratings in MwoA patients did not change significantly after eTNS 
treatment for the 41°C (p = 0.33) or the 51°C stimulus (p = 0.29).
imaging Data
During THS at the two different intensities, functional changes 
were identified in brain regions known to be involved in pain 
processing in both groups of subjects as reported in a previous 
study (11) (p = 0.05 cluster level corrected).
During low innocuous THS (41°C), there was no difference 
in BOLD response between MwoA patients before treatment 
 
and HC.
During noxious THS (51°C), the BOLD response in the per-
igenual part of the right ACC was significantly greater in MwoA 
patients before treatment than in HC (Talairach coordinates 
 
x, y, z: 12, 35, 7; t-value (peak) = 4.33) (Figure 2A).
In the same area, we found a significant reduction of the BOLD 
activation induced by the noxious THS in MwoA patients after 
eTNS (p = 0.008). Mean percentages of BOLD signal changes 
extracted from the perigenual part of the right ACC in HC and 
MwoA patients before and after eTNS are shown in Figure 2B.
No significant differences were detected in the whole-brain 
analysis of eTNS effects in MwoA patients, and no significant 
regional differences were observed in the pons between-subject 
groups, conditions or THS temperatures (i.e., MwoA patients 
compared to HC; MwoA patients before compared to after eTNS 
treatment).
correlation analyses
In the migraine group after eTNS treatment, but not in HC, we 
observed a significant positive correlation between ACC BOLD 
response to noxious THS before eTNS treatment and the decrease 
of ACC BOLD response to noxious THS after eTNS (i.e., the 
“delta value”) (p < 0.001; r = 0.78). Furthermore, a significant 
negative correlation was found between BOLD signal changes 
in ACC before eTNS treatment and migraine attack frequency 
pre-treatment (p < 0.05; r = −0.50) as well as between BOLD 
signal changes in ACC after eTNS treatment and migraine attack 
frequency after treatment (p < 0.05; r = −0.57) (i.e., the greater 
the ACC activation before and after eTNS treatment, the greater 
the number of migraine attacks per month before and after eTNS 
treatment). Finally, a significant negative correlation was also 
found between the perceived pain ratings during THS and fMRI-
BOLD signal changes extracted from the ACC cluster, both after 
eTNS treatment [i.e., the higher the ACC activation after eTNS 
treatment, the lower the NRS score (p = 0.01; r = −0.66)] (See 
Figure 3 for further details).
DiscUssiOn
In the present study, we found that the BOLD response to nox-
ious THS (51°C) was increased in the perigenual ACC in MwoA 
patients between attacks compared to HC. A 60-day eTNS treat-
ment with the Cefaly® device was able to normalize this abnormal 
ACC BOLD response and in parallel to significantly improve 
migraine severity. These results indicate that eTNS induces in 
MwoA patients a functional reorganization of the trigeminal pain 
processing network activated by a noxious thermal stimulus and 
suggests that this might be relevant for its therapeutic effects.
Nowadays, neurostimulation may offer an alternative to 
pharmacological therapy in migraine, burdened by a number of

contraindications and side effects (2, 3). Recently, the PREMICE 
trial (PREvention of MIgraine using Cefaly), a prospective, mul-
ticenter, double-blind, randomized, and sham-controlled trial 
provided evidence that eTNS is effective in migraine prevention 
and allows to reduce intake of abortive anti-migraine drugs (4). 
These data were confirmed by an open-label trial conducted on 
MwoA patients who experienced a low frequency of migraine 
attacks and were naïve to preventive anti-migraine drugs (6). 
Moreover, a retrospective survey in a large cohort of migraine 
patients using the Cefaly® device (5) evidenced the excellent 
safety and tolerability of the device.
However, the mechanisms of action underlying eTNS treat-
ment are still largely unknown. The initial rationale for the use of 
eTNS postulated that convergence of somatic afferents from the 
trigeminal or the C2 territories with visceral trigeminovascular 
afferents on spinal trigeminal nucleus nociceptors (16) may block 
ascending impulses in the pain pathway via the phenomenon of 
“after-suppression” in trigeminal nociceptors (17). This hypoth-
esis was not confirmed in several studies showing that neither 
eTNS nor per- or transcutaneous ONS decreased the sensitivity 
of trigeminal nociceptors (18).
On the other hand, evidence has accrued from percutaneous 
suboccipital neurostimulation (ONS) in chronic cluster headache 
and chronic migraine suggesting that slow neuromodulatory 
mechanisms in pain processing brain areas might be related to 
beneficial therapeutic effects. In particular, a H215O-PET study 
showed significant changes in regional cerebral blood flow in the 
pons, cuneus, pulvinar and ACC in ONS-treated patients with

chronic migraine (19) and a FDG-PET study increased glucose 
uptake in perigenual ACC in chronic cluster headache patients 
responding to ONS (20). More recently, a FDG-PET study (8) in 
episodic migraine patients before and after eTNS with Cefaly® 
revealed a normalization of the pre-treatment hypometabolism 
of OF cortex and ACC. Taken together, these data suggest that in 
patients with primary headaches, ONS might restore the balance 
within dysfunctioning pain control centres, by modifying top-
down activity of pain control, and that the ACC plays a crucial 
role in this process.
It is well known that the ACC is a key structure involved in 
analgesia mechanisms as well as in the affective and emotional 
dimensions of pain, such as self-related negative emotional 
 
states (21). The role of ACC in MwoA was also demonstrated 
in our previous studies showing an increased fMRI BOLD 
resp 
onse in this area during noxious THS (11), particularly in 
patients with ictal allodynia (12). Recently, 1H-MRS measure-
ments have shown a “complex” of metabolite alterations in the 
ACC of migraine patients during the interictal period, support-
ing its hyperexcitability even between attacks (22).
In line with these findings, our results indicate that the exces-
sive interictal activation of the ACC by noxious THS in MwoA 
patients normalizes after eTNS treatment, which could be related 
to its clinical efficacy.
Contrasting with previous studies (11), our brainstem ROI-
based analyses did not reveal significant eTNS-induced BOLD 
response changes in the brainstem of MwoA patients. Diffusion 
tensor imaging confirmed the presence of anatomical connec-
tions between cortical and brainstem pain processing regions 
(23). These connections enable top-down influences originating 
in cortical areas and likely modulate pain perception via opioid 
release in the brainstem (24, 25). This is supported by animal 
experiments showing that transcutaneous electrical nerve stimu-
lation can exert anti-nociception by activating the periaqueductal 
gray matter (26). We hypothesize that the present negative result 
may be due to the fact that functional recruitment of brainstem 
areas in descending modulation is detectable only with higher 
levels of pain, such as those experienced in the course of more 
severe painful stimulations or during a migraine attack.
From a clinical point of view, we observed significant impro-
vements in multiple migraine severity parameters after eTNS 
treatment with the Cefaly® device: a significant decrease in 
monthly frequency of both migraine attacks and migraine days, 
in mean pain intensity, and in daily life disability. The percentage 
of patients with ≥50% reduction of monthly migraine attacks 
and migraine days was remarkably high compared to available

pharmaco-economical reasons and for the prevention of medica-
tion overuse headache.
Correlation analysis showed a significant negative correla-
tion between ACC BOLD response to THS and the frequency 
of attacks both before and after eTNS treatment. These data are 
apparently in disagreement with the main findings of our study 
showing, after eTNS treatment, both a reduced ACC BOLD 
response to THS and a coexistent improvement of several clinical 
parameters in migraine patients. In this context, our data suggest 
that the eTNS treatment does not overturn the analgesic role 
of ACC in migraine patients, characterized by a compensatory 
increased activity likely in an attempt to reduce the frequency 
of migraine attacks (11, 12). Contrariwise, the eTNS treatment 
may produce a re-setting toward lower values of ACC activity 
(i.e., reduced BOLD response to THS) which is, notwithstanding, 
involved in the anti-nociception (i.e., the higher the ACC activa-
tion, the lower the NRS score after the eTNS treatment) and more 
evident in patients showing a greater ACC abnormality before the 
eTNS treatment (i.e., the “delta value”). On the other hand, also 
a decreased activity of ACC may lead to analgesic mechanism, 
as previously demonstrated (27). Finally, we cannot exclude that 
the increased ACC BOLD response to THS before the eTNS 
and reduced ACC BOLD response to THS after the eTNS may 
represent an epiphenomenon of migraine attacks frequency 
 
(i.e., the higher the frequency of migraine attacks, the higher the 
ACC activation, both before and after the eTNS treatment).
We are aware that our study has several limitations. First, we did 
not use an eTNS sham device and, therefore, we cannot rule out the 
possible role of a placebo effect in imaging and clinical data (28). 
However, the superiority of effective eTNS respect to sham stimu-
lation for the prevention of migraine headaches has already been 
demonstrated in a randomized, sham-controlled trial (4). Second, 
our HC did not undergo eTNS treatment and we can thus not deter-
mine if the eTNS-induced changes in ACC activation by THS are 
specific to migraineurs. By corollary, we cannot exclude that these 
changes could be due to the clinical improvement of patients after 
eTNS, rather than to the neurostimulation treatment itself.
Further studies are needed to ascertain that the therapeutic 
benefit of eTNS in MwoA patients is mediated by the ACC func-
tional normalization.

In conclusion, our results suggest that eTNS treatment with 
the Cefaly® device may induce a functional antinociceptive 
modulation in the ACC that may be involved in the mechanisms 
underlying its preventive anti-migraine efficacy.
We believe that further advances in the comprehension of 
neurostimulation mechanisms may shed light on migraine 
pathophysiology, and vice versa. Indeed, although compelling 
evidence supports the hypothesis of a dysfunctional central ner-
vous system in migraine, we confirm that interventions targeting 
the peripheral nervous system are able to modulate neuronal 
circuits involved in central sensitization and pain control.
