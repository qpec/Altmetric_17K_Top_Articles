Abstract
Obesity, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome are associated with changes to the gut 
microbiota; however, the mechanism by which modifications to the gut microbiota might lead to 
these conditions is unknown. Here we show that increased production of acetate by an altered gut 
microbiota leads to activation of the parasympathetic nervous system which in turn promotes 
increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), increased ghrelin secretion, hyperphagia, 
obesity and its related sequelae (Extended Data Fig. 1). Taken together, these data identify 
increased acetate production by a nutrient-gut microbiota interaction and subsequent 
parasympathetic activation as possible therapeutic targets for obesity.

  Gut microbial fatty acid turnover
Prior studies have observed both increases1–5 and decreases6,7 in plasma and fecal short-
chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations associated with overfeeding, obesity and the 
metabolic syndrome. However, whether and how alterations in SCFA play a causal role in 
the development of obesity is unknown. Because plasma SCFA concentrations may not fully 
represent the SCFA load presented to the body, we developed a method to measure whole-
body turnover rates of acetate, propionate, and butyrate by gas chromatography/mass 
spectrometry (GC/MS) and found that, in contrast to propionate and butyrate, whole-body 
acetate turnover as well as plasma and fecal acetate concentrations were markedly increased 
in insulin resistant three day and four week high fat fed (HFD) rats (Fig. 1a–b, Extended 
Data Fig. 2a–j).
Next we sought to determine the source of the increased acetate turnover in HFD rats. We 
measured tissue acetate concentrations and dilution of 13C acetate label during an infusion 
of 13C acetate, and found each to be increased in the luminal contents of the cecum and 
ascending colon, with HFD rats exhibiting more than a two-fold increase in total acetate in 
the cecum and colon as well as in 13C bicarbonate incorporation into 13C acetate compared 
to chow fed rats (Fig. 1c–d, Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 2k). In order to conclusively 
determine the source of the increased acetate production in HFD rats, we conducted four 
independent in vivo experiments to distinguish colon lumen acetate production from 
production by the rest of the body: we 1) washed out the contents of the cecum and colon 
with a saline flush, 2) ligated the portal vein below the splenic juncture, 3) treated rats with 
poorly absorbed broad-spectrum oral antibiotics and 4) performed an acute colectomy and 
found that each intervention reduced whole-body acetate turnover by 75–90% (Fig. 2b–f). 
Taken together these data strongly suggest that the gut microbiota is the source of most of 
the increased endogenous acetate production in HFD rats. We next showed that fecal 
material can generate acetate in vitro from 13C glucose or 13C fatty acids, and that boiling or 
irradiating the feces prevents the production of acetate, suggesting a role for fecal microbes 
in generating acetate (Extended Data Fig. 2l–n). Consistent with this hypothesis, treatment 
of the fecal material with broad-spectrum antibiotics vancomycin and/or gentamycin 
markedly reduced acetate production (Extended Data Fig. 2o).
 Acetate drives insulin secretion
Next we examined glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) during a hyperglycemic 
clamp and measured marked increases in GSIS in 3 day and 4 week HFD rats (Fig. 3a, 
Extended Data Fig. 3a–c). To determine whether the associated increases in acetate turnover 
drove this increased GSIS, we performed hyperglycemic clamps in chow fed rats given 
intra-arterial infusions of acetate to match whole-body acetate turnover to that measured in 
HFD rats. Acetate infusion in chow fed rats replicated the increases in GSIS measured in 
HFD rats (Fig. 3b–c, Extended Data Fig. 3d–g), strongly implicating increased acetate 
turnover in driving acute increases in GSIS in HFD rodents. In contrast, replacing butyrate 
turnover to levels observed in high fat fed rats had no effect on GSIS (Extended Data Fig. 
3h–m).

 In order to further evaluate the effects of alterations in food intake on gut acetate production, 
we fasted 4 week HFD rats for 48 hours and found that this intervention resulted in ~50% 
reductions in whole-body acetate turnover and in GSIS; however, replacing acetate by 
arterial infusion of 20 μmol/(kg-min) acetate resulted in restoration of GSIS in 48 hour 
fasted rats (Extended Data Fig. 4a–f). Next we performed a series of dietary interventions to 
assess whether simple caloric excess or variations in nutrient composition8–10 were 
responsible for the increased acetate turnover measured in HFD rats (Extended Data Fig. 
4g). Pair feeding isocaloric portions of chow or HFD resulted in no change in acetate 
turnover or GSIS, whereas dietary interventions resulting in increased caloric intake 
increased acetate turnover and GSIS proportionally to the total calories consumed (Extended 
Data Fig. 4h–n, R2=0.90). To examine the role of the gut microbiota in acetate-induced 
hyperinsulinemia, we treated HFD rats with broad-spectrum, poorly absorbable oral 
antibiotics and measured a 70% reduction in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion during a 
hyperglycemic clamp, which was acutely reversed by infusion of acetate to match plasma 
acetate turnover in HFD rats (Fig. 3d–e, Extended Data Fig. 4o–s).
To establish a causal relationship between the microbiota and GSIS, we next transferred 
fecal material from chow- or HFD-fed donors to chow- or HFD-fed recipients under 
anaerobic conditions. Consistent with previous reports,4,12–15 culture-independent 16S 
rRNA sequencing of donor and recipient fecal microbiomes revealed an increase in the 
relative abundance of Firmicutes and a decrease in the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in 
fresh fecal pellets from high fat fed donors relative to chow fed donors, and fecal 
transplantation altered the recipient animal microbiome to resemble that of the donor 
(Extended Data Fig. 5a–f). Notably, these fecal transplantations also transferred the 
corresponding acetate turnover, fecal acetate, and GSIS from the donor group to the 
recipient group (Fig. 3f–g, Extended Data Fig. 6a–e). However, transplantation of chow-fed 
donor microbiota into chow-fed recipients by an identical procedure did not produce 
microbiota alterations or metabolic phenotypes (Fig. 3f–g, Extended Data Fig. 5a–f, 6a–e).
Having found a strong causal relationship between acetate turnover and GSIS, we next 
examined the mechanism by which increased acetate turnover caused increased GSIS. We 
first examined whether acetate may stimulate GSIS through a direct effect on β-cells, 
perhaps through increasing acetylcarnitine concentrations.11,12 However, we found that 
neither acetate nor acetylcarnitine stimulated GSIS in isolated islet perifusions, ruling out a 
direct effect on the β-cell (Fig. 3h, Extended Data Fig. 6f–h). In addition, β-cell stimulatory 
amino acid concentrations and plasma glucagon concentrations were unchanged or reduced 
in the acetate-infused rats (Extended Data Fig. 6i–k). A small (~2 pM) but significant 
increase in plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) concentrations was measured in rats 
infused with acetate ( Extended Data Fig. 6l). Because GLP-1 can stimulate GSIS,13,14 we 
treated acetate-infused rats with a GLP-1 inhibitor and found no difference in GSIS in these 
animals (Extended Data Fig. 6m–s), demonstrating that these small changes in GLP-1 were 
not responsible for the increased GSIS in acetate-infused rats.

  Acetate drives GSIS via the parasympathetics
As parasympathetic input is a well-known stimulator of β-cell insulin secretion,15 we next 
measured plasma gastrin concentrations as a marker of parasympathetic activity in rats 
acutely infused with acetate, and observed a three-fold increase in plasma gastrin after 60 
min of infusion with 20 μmol/(kg-min) acetate (Fig. 4a). Increases in brain acetate 
concentrations in the 20 μmol/(kg-min) acetate infused animals confirmed the ability of 
acetate infused systemically to enter the brain circulation (Fig. 4b). Because vagal 
stimulation has been shown to drive and vagotomy has been shown to suppress basal and 
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion,16–20 we hypothesized that vagotomy would reduce 
GSIS in acetate-infused rats. Consistent with this hypothesis, vagotomized rats exhibited ~4-
fold lower plasma insulin concentrations throughout a hyperglycemic clamp without any 
effect on plasma glucagon concentrations (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 7a–h). In addition, 
treatment with the parasympathetic blocker atropine prior to the acetate infusion abolished 
acetate’s ability to stimulate GSIS, without any effect on plasma glucagon concentrations 
(Fig. 4d, Extended Data Fig. 7i–n), replicating prior studies demonstrating atropine’s ability 
to suppress basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion indirectly in vitro and in 
vivo.19,21–23 In order to further evaluate whether the effect of parasympathetic stimulation of 
GSIS is centrally mediated, we administered acetate intracerebroventricularly (ICV) at a 
dose chosen to increase cerebrospinal fluid acetate concentrations by 200 μM, mimicking 
the increases in plasma acetate concentrations measured with a 20 μmol/(kg-min) intra-
arterial acetate infusion. ICV acetate tripled GSIS during a hyperglycemic clamp without 
any difference in systemic acetate concentrations; however, this effect was blocked by 
treatment with atropine, and was independent of changes in plasma glucagon concentrations 
(Fig. 4e–f, Extended Data Fig. 8a–d), suggesting a central effect of acetate to increase GSIS. 
Because atropine has also been shown to act directly on the β-cell to suppress insulin 
secretion, we infused rats with intra-arterial acetate and examined the effect of ICV 
methylatropine, an atropine analog that does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Consistent 
with an effect of acetate to drive GSIS via the parasympathetic nervous system, 
methylatropine fully abrogated the effect of acetate to drive GSIS (Fig. 4g–h, Extended Data 
Fig. 8e–i). To further implicate activation of the parasympathetic nervous system in driving 
this effect, we injected the same dose of acetate into the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), and 
found that this intervention replicated the effects of systemic and ICV acetate on GSIS by 
driving parasympathetic outflow as indicated by a ten-fold increase in plasma gastrin 
concentrations without any change in systemic plasma acetate or glucagon (Fig. 4i–j, 
Extended Data Fig. 8j–o). Taken together, these data conclusively demonstrate that the effect 
of acetate to increase GSIS occurs through parasympathetic activation.
 Chronic increases in acetate drive obesity
We next examined whether a chronic increase in acetate turnover would promote chronic 
hyperinsulinemia, hyperphagia, and weight gain and the associated sequelae of obesity. To 
test this hypothesis, we performed ten-day continuous intragastric acetate infusions, treating 
chow fed rats with 20 μmol/(kg-min) acetate to mimic the increase in gut microbial acetate 
production measured in HFD rats (Extended Data Fig. 9a–b). Chronic intragastric acetate-
infused rats exhibited increased insulin secretion during both a hyperglycemic clamp and an

 intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, which was associated with a five-fold increase in 
plasma gastrin concentrations (Fig. 5a–b, Extended Data Fig. 9c–h). All of these effects 
were prevented in vagotomized rats. Consistent with the hypothesis that chronic postprandial 
hyperinsulinemia leads to increased weight gain, chronic intragastric acetate-infused rats 
exhibited more than a doubling in daily caloric intake and in weight gain over the ten-day 
infusion, which may be attributable, at least in part, to a three-fold increase in plasma ghrelin 
concentrations (Fig. 5c–d, Extended Data Fig. 9i–j). These effects were also prevented in 
vagotomized rats, demonstrating that parasympathetic activation is necessary to mediate 
acetate’s chronic effects on GSIS in awake, unrestrained rodents. Finally, acetate-infused 
rats exhibited insulin resistance, as indicated by impaired glucose disposal and impaired 
insulin suppression of hepatic glucose production during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic 
clamp; and increases in plasma, liver, and skeletal muscle triglyceride content without any 
differences in plasma glucagon concentrations (Fig. 5e–h, Extended Data Fig. 9k–p). 
Vagotomized rats exhibited none of these consequences of the acetate infusion.
Taken together, each of these experiments strongly suggests that the gut microbiota are 
responsible for generating the increased acetate turnover and driving obesity in HFD rats, 
although we cannot rule out an additional contribution of the microbiota modulating acetate 
absorption.24 To conclusively test this hypothesis, we measured plasma and colonic acetate 
content in germ-free (GF) mice lacking gut microbes and ex-GF mice 4 weeks after 
colonization with normal mouse feces (conventionalized; CONV-D) fed either a regular 
chow or high fat diet. Demonstrating the role of the gut microbiota as the main producer of 
acetate in vivo, GF mice had negligible plasma, colonic lumen, and tissue acetate 
concentrations as compared to CONV-D mice; only conventionalized mice exhibited an 
increase in acetate concentrations on high fat diet (Fig. 6a–c). GF mice fed 13C bicarbonate 
also exhibited strikingly lower plasma and tissue 13C enrichment than CONV-D mice, and 
only in CONV-D mice, 13C acetate was doubled in HFD relative to chow fed animals (Fig. 
6d). As rodents do not possess the enzymes necessary to convert bicarbonate to acetate, 
these results demonstrate that the gut microbiota are responsible for the increased acetate 
turnover in HFD animals, a conclusion corroborated by the fact that colonic 13C acetate 
enrichment in CONV-D mice was more than double the enrichment in plasma or in any 
other tissue (Extended Data Fig. 10a). In contrast propionate and butyrate concentration and 
enrichment were minimal in plasma and tissues in all mice (Extended Data Fig. 10b–g). 
Finally, because of the role of increased acetate in promoting parasympathetic activation, we 
measured plasma gastrin and ghrelin concentrations in the GF and CONV-D mice, and 
found that ex-GF conventionalized mice exhibited 2- and 10-fold increases in gastrin and 
ghrelin, respectively, which were associated with 2- and 5-fold increases in liver and skeletal 
muscle triglyceride content (Fig. 6e–h). Taken together, these data clearly implicate the gut 
microbiota as responsible for the majority of the whole-body plasma acetate turnover in vivo 
and for the increase in acetate turnover observed in high fat fed rodents.
 Conclusions
In summary, we show here that increased acetate production due to a gut microbiota-nutrient 
interaction in high fat fed rodents leads to activation of the parasympathetic nervous system 
resulting in increased ghrelin secretion and GSIS. This generates a positive feedback loop

 resulting in hyperphagia, hypertriglyceridemia, ectopic lipid deposition in liver and skeletal 
muscle, and liver and muscle insulin resistance. Evolutionarily, the increased acetate 
production that occurs when the gut microbiota are exposed to calorically dense nutrients 
may mediate an important positive feedback loop between the gut microbiota and the CNS 
that promotes hyperphagia (due to increased ghrelin secretion) and increased energy storage 
as fat (due to increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion) in foraging animals when they 
stumble across calorically dense foodstuffs in the wilderness. However, in the setting of 
chronic exposure to calorically dense, abundant food, this gut microbiota-brain-β cell axis 
promotes obesity and its related sequelae of hyperlipidemia, fatty liver disease and insulin 
resistance.
