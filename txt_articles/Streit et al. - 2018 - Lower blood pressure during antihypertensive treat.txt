Abstract
Background: the appropriateness of lowering systolic blood pressure remains controversial in the oldest-old. We tested
whether systolic blood pressure is associated with all-cause mortality and change in cognitive function for patients pre-
scribed antihypertensive treatment and those without treatment.
Methods: we studied participants in the population-based Leiden 85-plus cohort study. Baseline systolic blood pressure and
use of antihypertensive treatment were predictors; all-cause mortality and change in cognitive function measured using the
Mini-Mental State Examination were the outcomes. Grip strength was measured as a proxy for physical frailty. We used
Cox proportional hazards and mixed-effects linear regression models to analyse the relationship between systolic blood
pressure and both time to death and change in cognitive function. In sensitivity analyses, we excluded deaths within 1 year
and restricted analyses to participants without a history of cardiovascular disease.
Results: of 570 participants, 249 (44%) were prescribed antihypertensive therapy. All-cause mortality was higher in partici-
pants with lower blood pressure prescribed antihypertensive treatment (HR 1.29 per 10 mmHg lower systolic blood pres-
sure, 95% CI 1.15–1.46, P < 0.001). Participants taking antihypertensives showed an association between accelerated
cognitive decline and lower blood pressure (annual mean change −0.35 points per 10 mmHg lower systolic blood pressure,
95% CI −0.60, −0.11, P = 0.004); decline in cognition was more rapid in those with lower hand grip strength. In partici-
pants not prescribed antihypertensive treatment, no significant associations were seen between blood pressure and either
mortality or cognitive decline.
Conclusions: lower systolic blood pressure in the oldest-old taking antihypertensives was associated with higher mortality
and faster decline in cognitive function.

Introduction
Hypertension is the most important preventable cause of
cardiovascular disease (CVD), including stroke and myocar-
dial infarction [1]. The prevalence of hypertension increases
sharply with age [2]. It has been clear for at least two dec-
ades that older patients (>60 years) also benefit from
antihypertensive treatment [3, 4], but guidelines may not
apply equally to everyone over 60 years. For example, we
do not know if the effects of treating hypertension are simi-
lar among individuals aged over 80 years (the oldest-old)—
a segment of the population that is expected to triple in the
next two decades [5].

 Hypertension studies have tended to exclude patients
with multimorbidity and frailty. These criteria dispropor-
tionately exclude the oldest-old because this age group is
much more likely to have multimorbidity or to be frail
[6, 7]. At the same time, observational studies have raised
concerns about associations between low systolic blood
pressure (SBP), increased mortality and accelerated cogni-
tive decline, especially in the oldest-old living with frailty
[8]. Studying associations between SBP and cognitive
decline are challenging [9]. There is evidence that high SBP
in midlife damages cerebral vessels and impairs brain func-
tion [10], but low SBP in late life, particularly in frail sub-
jects, is associated with higher risk for cognitive decline
[11]. A study by Mosello et al. [12] found that lower SBP
was associated with faster cognitive decline in individuals
who were already cognitively impaired; several other studies
had produced similar findings [13–19]. Mosello et al. were
the first to describe that antihypertensive therapy modified
these associations: low SBP was associated with cognitive
decline only in patients under antihypertensive therapy, but
not in those who were not prescribed antihypertensive ther-
apy. Unfortunately, the follow-up time was too short to
detect long-term protective effects of antihypertensive treat-
ment, and the population was limited to patients attending
a memory clinic.
There is, therefore, a need for rigorous, population-
based observational studies with adequate follow-up time to
test the association between antihypertensive therapy, blood
pressure, mortality and cognitive decline in the oldest-old.
We analysed data from a population-based cohort study
with a 5-year follow-up to test if the association between
low SBP with all-cause mortality and cognitive function dif-
fers for oldest-old patients under antihypertensive treatment
and those without treatment, and to test if frailty modifies
these associations.
Methods
Study design and setting
We analysed data from a prospective, population-based
cohort study with a 5-year follow-up—the Leiden 85-plus
Study [20, 21]. All inhabitants of the city of Leiden, the
Netherlands, were invited to join this cohort study if they
turned 85 years between 1997 and 1999. No exclusion cri-
teria were applied. The target population was 705 inhabi-
tants. Of these, 14 (2.0%) died before being enrolled in the
study; 599 (85.0%) provided informed or proxy consent
[22]. The Medical Ethical Committee of the Leiden
University Medical Center approved the original study.
Participants
For this analysis, we applied two pre-specified exclusion cri-
teria. To lower the risk of reverse causality between SBP
and mortality risk, we excluded participants who died <3
months after they entered the cohort (n = 5). We also
excluded participants who had no SBP measurements at
baseline (n = 24).
Procedures and measurements
A history of CVD (i.e. previously recorded diagnoses of
angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, heart failure, intermit-
tent claudication, peripheral arterial surgery, transient ischae-
mic
attack,
and
stroke)
was
available
from
general
practitioners (GPs) or nursing home physicians. At baseline,
research nurses visited all participants to administer the Mini-
Mental State Examination (MMSE) [23]. At baseline, SBP
was measured twice with a mean time range between mea-
surements of 2 weeks. SBP was measured using a mercury
sphygmomanometer, in the seated position after at least
5 min of rest and with no vigorous exercise in the preceding
30 min. For this analysis, we averaged the two measurements
of SBP. The research nurses also recorded socio-demographic
characteristics (level of education, income, living place); cur-
rent smoking status (yes/no); depressive symptoms if MMSE
was >18 points using the 15-point Geriatric Depression
Scale [24]; and hand grip strength using a hand dynamometer.
During annual follow-up visits, nurses repeated MMSE mea-
surements. All participants were followed for all-cause mortal-
ity for 5 years using municipal records.
Statistical analysis
We assessed associations between exposure (baseline SBP
and use of antihypertensive medication) and outcomes (all-
cause mortality and annual change in cognitive function)
over 5 years. At baseline, we compared characteristics of
participants prescribed and not prescribed antihypertensive
therapy. The crude and adjusted modelling approaches for
all-cause mortality using Cox proportional hazard models
and annual change in MMSE using mixed-effects linear
regression models are described in detail in Appendix 1,
available at Age and Ageing online. Subgroup analyses were
performed for the second aim, to test if grip strength (as a
proxy for frailty) modified the associations of SBP and
treatment with the outcomes. We stratified both models for
low/high hand grip strength to explore effect sizes and
directions of effects. However, due to small sample sizes,
this subgroup analysis was only exploratory. In sensitivity
analyses, we firstly excluded deaths within 1 year after base-
line; secondly restricted the models to participants without
a history of CVD at baseline; and thirdly recoded partici-
pants who could not perform the hand grip strength test as
missing. A two-sided P-value of 0.05 was taken as statistic-
ally significant for all analyses. We used STATA 15.0
(StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) for all analyses.
Results
We analysed data from 570 individuals, of whom 249
(43.7%) were prescribed antihypertensive therapy at base-
line (Table 1). Participants prescribed antihypertensive

 therapy and those not prescribed antihypertensives were
similar in all aspects except for a higher prevalence of CVD
in those prescribed antihypertensives (61.9% vs. 35.8%,
P < 0.001). The other cardiovascular, socio-demographic,
and functional characteristics at baseline were equally dis-
tributed among the two groups.
Appendix 2, available at Age and Ageing online describes
the sample of 214 participants grouped in lowest/highest
SBP-quintile. In the group prescribed antihypertensive ther-
apy, participants with SBP <140 mmHg were more often
institutionalised than those with SBP >170 mmHg (33.3%
vs. 4.7%, P = 0.001), and had slightly lower baseline
MMSE (median 26 vs. median 27, P = 0.021). The same
pattern was evident in participants not prescribed antihyper-
tensive therapy.
All-cause mortality over time
Appendix 3, available at Age and Ageing online shows the
Kaplan–Meier survival curves for participants in the highest
and lowest quintiles of SBP. Those prescribed antihyperten-
sive therapy with SBP > 170 mmHg had the lowest risk of
all-cause mortality, and those with SBP <140 mmHg had
the highest risk (log rank test P < 0.001).
During the 5-year follow-up, 263 (46.1%) participants
died. For those participants prescribed antihypertensive
therapy, all-cause mortality was significantly higher with
decreasing SBP (HR 1.29 per 10 mmHg lower SBP, 95%CI
1.15–1.46, P < 0.001) (Table 2). For those not prescribed
antihypertensives, the effect was smaller and did not reach
significance (HR 1.08 per 10 mmHg lower SBP, 95%
1.00–1.18, P = 0.057). The sensitivity analyses returned
similar results in the model excluding deaths (n = 47) within
1-year after baseline (see Appendix 4, available at Age and
Ageing online) and when the model was restricted to partici-
pants with no history of CVD at baseline.
Change in cognitive function over time
Appendix 5, available at Age and Ageing online describes the
median annual change in MMSE for those in the highest
and lowest quintiles of SBP, both for those prescribed anti-
hypertensives and those not prescribed antihypertensives. In
the group prescribed antihypertensives, those with SBP in
the lowest quintile showed faster cognitive decline compared

 to those in the highest SBP-quintile (−1.1 points per year
[IQR1.4] vs −0.1 points per year [IQR 0.6]; P = 0.022). For
those not prescribed antihypertensive therapy, no significant
difference between the lowest and highest quintiles of blood
pressure was evident (−0.7 points per year [IQR 2.2]
vs. −0.5 points per year [IQR 1.4] P = 0.46).
After accounting for baseline differences, those pre-
scribed antihypertensives showed a faster rate of decline in
MMSE with lower blood pressure (annual change in
MMSE of −0.35 [95% −0.60 to −0.11] per 10 mmHg drop
in SBP; P = 0.004). For those not prescribed antihyperten-
sive therapy, the rate of decline was not significantly faster
with lower baseline blood pressure (annual change in
MMSE −0.14 [95% −0.39 to 0.11] per 10 mmHg drop in
SBP; P = 0.28) (Table 3). The sensitivity analysis returned
similar results when the model was restricted to participants
with no history of CVD at baseline.
Modification by frailty
Our results did not change in our subgroup analyses for all-
cause mortality (Table 2), when we stratified by low- or hih-
hand grip strength in participants prescribed antihyperten-
sive therapy (p for interaction = 0.28) or not prescribed
antihypertensive therapy (p for interaction = 0.29). There
was weak evidence for an association in those participants
not prescribed antihypertensives who had low hand grip
strength (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.00, 1.21, P = 0.060).
The subgroup analyses for annual change in cognitive
function (Table 3) showed that accelerated change in
MMSE with lower SBP was significant for those under anti-
hypertensive therapy when they had low hand grip (annual
change in MMSE −0.37, [95% CI −0.70, −0.05] per
10 mmHg drop in SBP; P = 0.023) but did not reach sig-
nificance for those with high hand grip strength (annual
change
in
MMSE
−0.24,
[95%CI
−0.57,
0.09]
per
10 mmHg drop in SBP; P = 0.15). There was no evidence
of interaction of hand grip strength in those without ther-
apy (p for interaction = 0.10). The sensitivity analysis
returned similar results when participants who could not
perform the hand grip strength test were classified as miss-
ing data instead of categorised as having low hand grip
strength.
Discussion
In this population-based cohort of individuals aged 85 years
with a 5-year follow-up, we found lower SBP was associated
with higher all-cause mortality and faster annual cognitive
decline in participants prescribed antihypertensive therapy.
In participants without antihypertensive treatment, no rela-
tion was found between SBP and mortality or cognitive
decline. Low grip strength did not modify the association of
SBP and mortality, but did for cognitive decline.
Our findings are in line with other cohort studies show-
ing the same associations of low SBP and increased mortality
although previous analyses did not stratify for antihyperten-
sive treatment [25, 26]. For cognition, age seems to modify
the associations; in studies with patients aged >60 there was
either no association between SBP and cognitive decline [27]
or an association of higher SBP with a lower risk of demen-
tia [28]. At age 85 years and older, low SBP predicts the
onset of dementia [15] and is associated with worse cognitive
function [17]. Similarly, a cohort of male participants whose
SBP trajectories were followed over 32 years showed that
those who develop dementia had a greater increase in SBP
followed by a decrease in SBP compared to those who did
not develop dementia [29]. These findings could explain the
accelerated cognitive decline we found in our patients with
low SBP under antihypertensive treatment. Our results are
also in line with Mosello et al.’s findings [12] where 172
patients with a mean age of 79 years, taking antihyperten-
sive therapy, and with a diagnosis of dementia or mild
cognitive impairment of outpatient memory clinics were
followed-up for a median of 9 months. Our results confirm
and extend these findings by showing similar associations in
a population-based cohort over a longer observation period
of 5 years.

 This cohort study has several strengths. The population-
based sample included a large number of participants,
extensive measurements and high follow-up rates with a
low risk for selection bias. The inclusion of participants
from nursing homes further enhances the generalisability of
the findings.
This is an observational study, with all the limitations
that implies. However, it is useful to look at the associa-
tions we identified by situating them within the GRADE
framework and apply the Bradford Hill’s criteria for caus-
ation because ‘observational studies may provide more
relevant information than RCTs’ [30]. The strength of
association we found, consistency with prior studies, and
the dose–response relationship in our study are three of
these criteria. In addition, this study established a tem-
poral relationship between SBP values measured at base-
line and outcome assessments over 5 years. Our sensitivity
analysis showed robust results when we excluded deaths
within 1 year after baseline, which reduces, but does not
exclude, the risk that our findings are due to reverse
causality.
We acknowledge further limitations. First, there was no
SBP measurement at baseline for about 5% of participants.
Excluding these participants is unlikely to introduce bias as
the numbers are small. Second, the risk for confounding by
indication limits the causal interpretation of our associa-
tions. Interpretation of the results is helped by the findings
of a large international study including >2,500 GPs [31],
which may allow us to understand and adjust for factors
(for example frailty) that influence GPs’ decision to start or
not start antihypertensive therapy in the oldest-old. Third, if
participants are prescribed with antihypertensive therapy
but did not adhere to treatment, misclassification bias could
be introduced. However, Dutch individuals seem to adhere
best to therapy compared to seven other countries [32],
and this high level of adherence reduces the risk of such
bias in our sample.
Despite these limitations, the finding that low SBP is
associated with increased mortality and cognitive decline in
oldest-old under antihypertensive therapy is concerning. For
clinicians, this study raises the question of what the optimal
target blood pressure level is for 85-year-old frail patients.
We support the suggestions from Benetos et al. [33] to fol-
low an individualised approach when treating hypertension
in oldest-old >80 years with frailty, due to the lack of evi-
dence [6, 34]. Observational studies remain at risk for bias
(i.e. reverse causality, residual confounding), and the way to
provide more evidence could be via deprescribing trials to
test effectiveness and safety of lowering or removing anti-
hypertensive therapy. The Dutch DANTE trial used this
approach over a 16-week period in patients aged 75 and
older with mild cognitive impairment [35]. In DANTE,
deprescribing was not beneficial but was safe. Future stud-
ies should try to recruit patients that could benefit the most
from deprescribing such as individuals with frailty and/or
limited life expectancy.
Key points
• We tested if the association of low systolic blood pressure
with mortality/cognition is modified by antihypertensive
therapy
• We followed-up 570 persons all 85-year-old for 5 years.
Mortality was 29% higher per 10 mmHg lower blood
pressure under therapy
• The same participants showed a cognitive decline of
−0.35 in MMSE/year and even more rapid in those with
lower hand grip strength
• In participants without therapy, there were no such
associations
• Oldest-old with low systolic blood pressure during antihy-
pertensive treatment are at risk for higher mortality and
accelerated cognitive decline
