IMPORTANCE Older age is associated with increased risk of pregnancy-associated stroke
(PAS). Data are limited on age-specific incidence ratios of PAS compared with stroke risk in
nonpregnant women.
OBJECTIVES To assess the risk of stroke by age group in pregnant and postpartum women
compared with their nonpregnant contemporaries and to compare risk factors across age
groups in the exposed (pregnant/postpartum) and unexposed (nonpregnant) populations.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
billing codes from the calendar year 2003-2012 New York State Department of Health
inpatient database and population data were used to identify all women aged 12 to 55 years
with cerebrovascular events, including transient ischemic attack, ischemic and hemorrhagic
stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, and nonspecified PAS. The cumulative incidence of PAS
per 100 000 pregnant/postpartum women vs nonpregnancy-associated stroke (NPAS) per
100 000 women in age cohorts of 24 years or younger, 25 to 34, 35 to 44, and 45 years or
older was calculated. Risk factors between groups were compared using logistic regression
models. The study included data from calendar years 2003 through 2012. Data analysis was
performed from July 11, 2015, to July 16, 2016.
EXPOSURES Pregnancy, including the postpartum period up to 6 weeks after delivery.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incidence risk ratios (IRRs) for stroke per age cohort,
defined as cumulative risk of stroke in the exposed population divided by cumulative risk of
stroke in the unexposed population, were determined, and stroke risk factors and mortality
were compared between populations.
RESULTS There were 19 146 women hospitalized with stroke during the study period; 797 of
the women were pregnant/post partum. The overall median (interquartile range) age of the
women was 31 (25-35) years in those with PAS and 48 (41-52) years in those with NPAS. The
incidence of PAS in women aged 12 to 24 years was 14 events per 100 000 pregnant/
postpartum women vs NPAS incidence of 6.4 per 100 000 nonpregnant women (IRR, 2.2;
95% CI, 1.9-2.6); for ages 25 to 34 years, 21.2 per 100 000 vs 13.5 per 100 000 (IRR, 1.6;
95% CI, 1.4-1.7); for ages 35 to 44 years, 33 per 100 000 vs 31 per 100 000 (IRR, 1.1; 95% CI,
0.9-1.2); and for ages 45 to 55 years, 46.9 per 100 000 vs 73.7 per 100 000 (IRR, 0.6;
95% CI, 0.3-1.4). PAS accounted for 18% of strokes in women younger than 35 years vs 1.4%
of strokes in women aged 35 to 55 years. Women in the NPAS group vs the PAS group had
more vascular risk factors, including chronic hypertension (age <35 years: 437 [15.7%] vs 60
[9.8%], P < .001; age 35-55 years: 7573 [48.6%] vs 36 [19.3%], P < .001), diabetes (age <35
years: 103 [3.7%] vs 9 [1.5%], P = .002; age 35-55 years: 2618 [16.8%] vs 12 [6.4%], P < .001),
and active smoking (age <35 years: 315 [11.3%] vs 29 [4.8%], P < .001; age 35-55 years: 2789
[17.9%] vs 10 [5.3%], P < .001); and had higher mortality (age <35 years: 288 [11.3%] vs 37
[6.5%], P < .001; age 35-55 years: 2121 [13.4%] vs 14 [6.1%], P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Younger women, but not older women, have an increased
stroke risk during pregnancy and post partum compared with their nonpregnant
contemporaries. These results suggest that pregnancy does not increase the risk of stroke in
older women.

P
regnancy-associated stroke (PAS) affects approxi-
mately 34 of 100 000 pregnancies,1 and the incidence
of PAS is increasing.2,3 Although prior studies1,4 sug-
gest that older women have an increased risk of PAS, which is
of concern given the growing number of women who delay
childbearing,theseinvestigationsrarelyincludecalculatedage-
specificincidenceriskratios(IRRs)todeterminewhetherstroke
risk in older pregnant and postpartum women exceeds stroke
risk in nonpregnant women of the same age.1,3,5-9 In this popu-
lation-based study using New York State administrative data,
we determined age-specific IRRs for PAS vs nonpregnancy-
associated stroke (NPAS) in predefined age cohorts. We then
compared stroke risk factors by age-stratified groups in the
pregnant/postpartum and nonpregnant groups of women and
determined mortality for each age group.
Methods
Study Design and Data Description
Weconductedaretrospectivecohortanalysisusingbillingdata,
coded according to the International Classification of Dis-
eases,NinthRevision(ICD-9),fromthe2003-2012calendaryear
New York State Department of Health Statewide Planning and
Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) inpatient database
(https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/sparcs/). The New York
State Department of Health maintains this database for the
purposeoftrackingoutcomes;allinpatienthospitalizationsare
included, and each patient is given a unique identifier. We
identifiedallwomenaged12to55yearsadmittedwithtransient
ischemic attack (TIA) or ischemic stroke (ICD-9 codes 433.xx,
434.xx, and 436), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) (ICD-9 code
431), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) (ICD-9 code 430),
cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) (ICD-9 codes 325 and 671
.5x),andnonspecifiedPAS,includingpostpartumstroke(ICD-9
codes 674.0-674.4). Traumatic SAH, traumatic ICH, and
hospitalizations with a primary rehabilitation diagnosis (V57)
were excluded. Although we recognize that inclusion of TIA
andCVTmayoverestimatestrokediagnoses,weincludedthem
sincetheymaysharecommonpathophysiologiccharacteristics
and have been used in other population-based studies.2,10 To
validate pregnancy-specific ICD-9 codes, we used a separate
internal data set tracking all admissions for TIA, ischemic
stroke,andhemorrhagicstrokeatColumbiaUniversityMedical
Center.11 We reviewed billing codes and confirmed that 34 of
37 women with PAS had 1 or more of the above pregnancy-
specific stroke-related ICD-9 codes (ICD-9 codes 674.0-674
.4), indicating an 8% false-negative rate.
Columbia University Institutional Review Board ap-
proval was obtained to conduct the analysis. The same board
waived the need for informed consent because of the public
and deidentified nature of the data.
Pregnant/postpartum women were identified by admis-
sions with a delivery code (ICD-9 codes V27, 72.x, 73.x, 650-
659, 74.0x-74.2x, 74.4, or 74.99), admissions with a preg-
nancycode(630.xx × -648.xx)withnodeliverycode(indicating
an antepartum admission), and admissions with a postpartum
code(660.xx × -677.xx)withoutadeliverycode(indicatingad-
mission during the first 6 weeks after delivery).12 For women
whosestrokeoccurredduringthedeliveryadmission,anICD-9
code of 674, signifying nonspecified PAS with a fifth digit of 2
(suffix .x2), was considered to indicate a postpartum stroke, in
accordance with official ICD-9 coding guidelines.13
Patient Characteristics, Risk Factors,
and Outcomes of Interest
We characterized PAS in terms of timing (antepartum or post
partum), delivery method, and pregnancy-specific risk fac-
tors. A 6-week postpartum period was chosen because ICD-9
codes do not reliably identify postpartum admissions be-
yond 6 weeks.13 Postpartum admissions were identified using
a fifth digit of 4 in International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes for primary
orsecondarypregnancy-relateddiagnosis,ICD-9-CMcodeV24
foranylisteddiagnosis,orpostpartumdiagnosis-relatedgroup
(DRG) codes 376-377. Antenatal hospitalizations were identi-
fied by a fifth digit of 3 in ICD-9-CM codes for primary or sec-
ondarypregnancy-relateddiagnosis;ICD-9-CMcodesV22,V23,
V28, or 792.3 for any listed diagnosis; or antenatal DRG codes
378-384.14 Abortion-related admissions were included and
characterized as antepartum or post partum by the same
method. Using ICD-9 codes, we identified demographic char-
acteristics as well as nonpregnancy-specific vascular risk fac-
tors in both PAS and NPAS. We identified infections present
on admission using ICD-9 codes and a SPARCS-specific modi-
fier since acute infections may trigger stroke in young
people.15-17 Strokes (both PAS and NPAS) were characterized
as ischemic (including TIA), hemorrhagic (including ICH and
SAH), CVT, or nonspecified. The ICD-9 codes used to identify
stroke subtypes and comorbidities are listed in eTable 1 in the
Supplement. Mortality was defined as in-hospital death or dis-
charge to hospice care from the admission of interest, using a
SPARCS-specificindicator.Populationdatawereobtainedfrom
New York State Department of Health Vital Statistics (https:
//www.health.ny.gov/statistics/vital_statistics/) from the same
time period (calendar years 2003-2012).
Statistical Analysis
Cumulative incidence of PAS per 100 000 deliveries in ap-
proximate 10-year age cohorts (≤24, 25-34, 35-44, ≥45 years)
Key Points
Question Does pregnancy increase stroke risk in older women
of childbearing age?
Findings In this population-based study in New York State,
age-stratified incidence risk ratios were calculated to determine
the stroke risk during pregnancy or post partum, compared with
stroke risk in similarly aged nonpregnant women. Stroke risk was
more than doubled in women aged 12 to 24 years and increased
significantly by 60% in women 25 to 34 years during pregnancy
or post partum; there was no difference in stroke risk in women
35 years or older.
Meaning Pregnancy does not increase stroke risk in older women
but does increase stroke risk in younger women.

was calculated, along with cumulative incidence of NPAS per
100 000 nonpregnant women in the same age group. We de-
termined IRRs for each age cohort, defined as the cumulative
incidence of stroke in the exposed group (pregnant or post-
partum women) divided by the cumulative incidence of stroke
in the unexposed group (nonpregnant women). To avoid over-
counting due to institutional transfers or readmissions, inci-
dence was calculated per individual patient: if a woman had
multiple stroke admissions during the study period, only 1 ad-
mission was counted. Patient characteristics, risk factors, and
mortality in the PAS and NPAS groups were compared and
stratified by age group, using χ2 and Fisher exact tests for di-
chotomous and categorical variables. Logistic regression mod-
els including only risk factors with P < .05 were created to ad-
just for risk factor interactions. We also compared pregnancy
complicationsinyoungerandolderwomenwithPASusinguni-
variate analysis. Statistical analysis was conducted using SAS,
version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc). Data analysis was performed
from July 11, 2015, to July 16, 2016.
Results
Incidence of Stroke by Age
Of the 19 146 women hospitalized with stroke during the study
period, 797 women (4.2%) were pregnant or post partum. The
incidence of PAS in women aged 12 to 24 years was 14 per
100 000 pregnant/postpartum women vs NPAS incidence of
6.4 per 100 000 nonpregnant women (IRR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.9-
2.6); for ages 25 to 34 years, 21.2 per 100 000 vs 13.5 per
100 000 (IRR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.4-1.7); for ages 35 to 44 years, 33
per 100 000 vs 31 per 100 000 (IRR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9-1.2); and
for ages 45 to 55 years, 46.9 per 100 000 vs 73.7 per 100 000
(IRR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.3-1.4) (Table 1). Baseline demographics of
both groups are reported in Table 2. Compared with the PAS
group, women in the NPAS group were older (median age, 48
years; interquartile range, 41-52 years), more likely to be white,
and more likely to be uninsured. Those with PAS were younger
(median age, 31 years; interquartile range, 25-35 years) and
morelikelytobeofnonwhiterace/ethnicity.Althoughthehigh-
est incidence of PAS occurred in the oldest group (46.9 per
100 000 deliveries), the highest IRR occurred in the youngest
group (2.2) and decreased with increasing age (Figure 1). Fol-
low-upsensitivityanalysisexcludingpatientswithTIAandCVT
showed unchanged results (eTable 2 in the Supplement). PAS
accountedfor15%ofstrokesinwomenaged12to24years;20%
of strokes in women aged 25 to 34 years; 5% of strokes in those
aged 35 to 44 years; and 0.05% of strokes in women aged 45
to 55 years. There were 77 women (9.7%) in the PAS group who
had multiple stroke admissions and 2277 women (12.4%) with
multiple stroke admissions in the NPAS group; each of these
women was counted only once.

Timing and Characteristics of Strokes
in Pregnant/Postpartum Women
Among the 797 women with PAS, 264 strokes (33.1%) oc-
curred antepartum, 178 (22.3%) occurred during the delivery
hospitalizationwithoutspecificationofantepartumorpostpar-
tum, and 355 (44.5%) occurred post partum, 249 of which
(70.1%) occurred after discharge from the hospital following
delivery. Stroke subtypes for women in both groups (PAS and
NPAS) stratified by age cohort are shown in Figure 2.
Pregnancy Characteristics and Complications
in Women With PAS
Of the women with PAS, 431 women (54.1%) underwent ce-
sarean delivery, 259 (32.5%) had hypertensive disorders of
pregnancy (gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, or ec-
lampsia), and 117 (14.7%) had infection present on admission,
more than half of whom (68 [58.2%]) had chorioamnionitis.
Age-stratified characteristics and complications of preg-
nancy seen in the PAS group are described in eTable 3 in the
Supplement.Becauseofthesmallnumberofwomenintheold-
est group and the inflection point at age 35 years in the IRRs,
age cohorts were consolidated into 2 groups of women with
PAS: women younger than 35 years and those 35 years or older.
In univariate analysis, there were no significant between-
group differences.
Stroke Risk Factors in PAS and NPAS
In univariate analysis using the same 2 PAS and NPAS age co-
horts described above (eTables 4 and 5 in the Supplement), we
found that, in both cohorts, women with PAS were signifi-
cantly less likely than women with NPAS to have vascular risk

or Hispanic (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.5-2.5) in multivariable analysis;
this difference was not seen in women 35 years or older.
Outcomes After Stroke
Mortality was significantly lower in the PAS group than in the
NPAS group (51 of 797 [6.4%] vs 2409 of 18 349 [13.1%];
P < .001).Themajority(37of51[72.5%])ofthewomenwhodied
in the PAS group were younger than 35 years, whereas most
(2121of2409[88%])ofthewomenwhodiedintheNPASgroup
were 35 years or older (P < .001). However, even in women
younger than 35 years, mortality remained higher in the NPAS
vs PAS group (age <35 years: 288 of 2542 [11.3%] vs 37 of 566
[6.5%]; P < .001; age 35-55 years: 2121 of 15 807 [13.4%] vs 14
of 321 [6.1%]). Of the women who died in both groups, most
had hemorrhagic (ICH or SAH) strokes (34 of 51 [66.7%] in the
PAS group, 1514 of 2409 [62.8%] in the NPAS group, P = .58).
A higher proportion of the deaths in the PAS group vs NPAS
group were due to ICH (24 of 51 [47.1%] vs 762 of 2409 [31.6%],
P = .02). Mortality for each age cohort is reported in Table 3.
Discussion
In this study of all stroke admissions in New York State from
2003 to 2012, we found that, although older women had a
higher incidence of PAS compared with younger women, their
risk of stroke was not higher than the risk of similarly aged
women who were not pregnant. Despite stroke being a rare
event in young women, 18% of all strokes in women younger
than 35 years were associated with pregnancy; in contrast,
among older women of childbearing age, 1.4% of strokes were
associated with pregnancy.
Prior studies1,4,18 have noted an increased risk of PAS with
older maternal age. Potential explanations include a higher
prevalence of vascular risk factors, such as chronic hyperten-
sion and diabetes. Risk of preeclampsia, a known risk factor
for PAS, also increases with advanced maternal age, although
theyoungestmothersarealsoatahigherriskofpreeclampsia.19
Most prior studies, however, were designed to identify stroke
risk factors in pregnant women and lacked a nonpregnant con-
trol group. Few population-based studies have examined IRRs
of PAS vs NPAS,6-9,20,21 and none has reported age-stratified
IRRs, although some8,9 have adjusted for age in their compari-
sons. Furthermore, most previous studies6,7,9 were con-
ducted in relatively homogeneous populations. Population-
based stroke research in the United States has been hampered
by the lack of a comprehensive national surveillance data-
base to track cardiovascular outcomes,22 although a recent
cross-sectional study5 of women aged 15 to 44 years included
inanationwidestrokeregistryfoundthat,comparedwithnon-
pregnant women with hemorrhagic stroke, pregnant women
with hemorrhagic strokes were younger and had fewer vas-
cular risk factors.
Younger women may appear to have an increased risk of
PAS because of the high prevalence of pregnancy in this popu-
lation. However, our sample’
s complete capture of the New
York State population as denominators in the incidence rates
(in the exposed and unexposed populations) reduces the risk
of prevalence bias skewing our results. Older women had more
vascular risk factors and may have had more difficulty con-
ceiving or had been counseled against pregnancy, skewing the
older pregnant population toward healthier women. Simi-
larly, older age predisposes nonpregnant women to stroke, re-
ducing the relative difference in stroke risk in the later years
duringpregnancy.However,ourresultssuggestthatstrokerisk
during pregnancy could be mitigated in older women by con-
trol of vascular risk factors.
Different underlying stroke mechanisms may factor into
why younger women had a higher stroke risk during preg-
nancy. Compared with strokes in older age groups in which
common stroke mechanisms include cardioembolism from
atrial fibrillation, carotid atherosclerotic disease, and small-
vessel disease causing lacunar infarcts,23 strokes in the young
population often have rarer stroke mechanisms: arterial dis-
sections, cerebral venous thrombosis, underlying primary or
secondary hypercoagulable states, patent foramen ovale, rup-
ture of arteriovenous malformations, and the reversible cere-
bral vasoconstriction syndrome.11,24,25 Reversible cerebral va-
soconstriction syndrome is associated with preeclampsia and

cell-free fetal DNA in the maternal circulation have been pos-
tulated as potential explanations for the endothelial dysfunc-
tion associated with preeclampsia.28-31 Similar inflammatory
mechanisms not present in nonpregnant women may put very
young mothers at higher stroke risk.
Black and Hispanic race/ethnicity increased the risk of PAS
in the cohort younger than 35 years, but not in the cohort 35
years or older. Hispanic ethnicity had an even higher associa-
tion than black race; this new finding is important32 given the
rapidly growing young Hispanic population throughout the
United States.33 However, these results may not be generaliz-
able, since most New York State Hispanic people are of Carib-
bean-Hispanic descent34,35 in contrast to the overall US His-
panic population, made up mainly of Mexican-origin Hispanic
individuals.36 More research is needed to confirm and ex-
plore this finding, especially since most Hispanic people in the
United States are younger than 35 years.37
As noted in previous studies,4,8,38 the delivery and post-
partumperiodappearedtoconferthegreatestriskofPAS.Hem-
orrhagic strokes outnumbered ischemic strokes, although
stroke type could not be ascertained reliably in more than one-
third of the patients; this finding also correlates with prior
research.5,7 Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were com-
mon in both younger and older women with PAS in our study.
Together, these findings emphasize the imperative for post-
partum blood pressure monitoring extending beyond the de-
livery hospitalization.39 After adjusting for other risk factors,
we found that women with PAS had higher odds of smoking,
underscoring the importance of smoking screening and ces-
sation counseling during routine prenatal visits.
Our study has limitations. One limiting factor is that ICD-9
billing data lack specificity, especially in regard to PAS. For ex-
ample, cerebrovascular disorders in the puerperium (ICD-9
code 674.xx) may include multiple disease categories. Al-
though these codes have been used to identify PAS in prior
studies,2,3,21 we validated them further by reviewing medical
records from our data set of women with PAS, confirming a low
false-negative rate. Additional validation studies are needed
to determine false-positive rates; some women with codes for
cerebrovasculardisordersinthepuerperiummayhavehadsei-
zure or migraine rather than clinically confirmed stroke.
Another limitation was our inability to determine the exact
timing of PAS in many women. In addition, there may be
risk factors (eg, underlying autoimmune or inflammatory
conditions) or medication effects (eg, aspirin or antihyper-
tensive medication use), which we did not account for in our
analysis.
Our study has several strengths. SPARCS is a comprehen-
sive data set, capturing all stroke admissions in the state. New
York State is a diverse region including both urban and rural
areas and a wide range of ethnic and socioeconomic back-
grounds,reflectingtheincreasingdiversityoftheUnitedStates.
Furthermore, few population-based studies6-9 of PAS have re-
ported IRRs and stroke risk factors by age cohort.
Conclusions
Inoursampleofallwomenaged12to55yearshospitalizedwith
stroke in New York State from 2003 to 2012, younger pregnant
and postpartum women—but not older women—were at in-
creased risk of stroke compared with their nonpregnant con-
temporaries. These results have potential implications for re-
search aimed at better characterizing and preventing PAS and
clinicallyintermsofcounselingpatients.Althougholderwomen
have an increased risk of many pregnancy complications, a
higherriskofstrokemaynotbeoneofthem.Ourresultsshould
be interpreted with caution and regarded primarily as hypoth-
esis generating; more research is needed to investigate why
younger women may have an increased risk of PAS.
