Adherence to CDC Recommendations for the Treatment of Uncomplicated 
Gonorrhea — STD Surveillance Network, United States, 2016

Gonorrhea, the sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused 
by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, is the second most common notifi-
able disease in the United States after chlamydia; 468,514 
cases were reported to state and local health departments in 
2016, an increase of 18.5% from 2015 (1). N. gonorrhoeae 
has progressively developed resistance to most antimicrobials 
used to treat the infection (2). As a result, CDC recommends 
two antimicrobials (250 mg of ceftriaxone [IM] plus 1 g of 
azithromycin [PO]) for treating uncomplicated gonorrhea 
to improve treatment efficacy and, potentially, to slow the 
emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance. To moni-
tor adherence to the current CDC-recommended regimen 
for uncomplicated gonorrhea, CDC reviewed enhanced data 
collected on a random sample of reported cases of gonorrhea 
in seven jurisdictions participating in the STD Surveillance 
Network (SSuN) and estimated the proportion of patients 
who received the CDC-recommended regimen for uncom-
plicated gonorrhea, by patient characteristics and diagnosing 
facility type. In 2016, the majority of reported patients with 
gonorrhea (81%) received the recommended regimen. There 
were no differences in the proportion of patients receiving 
the recommended regimen by age or race/ethnicity; however, 
patients diagnosed with gonorrhea in STD (91%) or family 
planning/reproductive health (94%) clinics were more likely 
to receive this regimen than were patients diagnosed in other 
provider settings (80%). These data document high provider 
adherence to CDC gonorrhea treatment recommendations in 
specialty STD clinics, indicating high quality of care provided 
in those settings. Local and state health departments should 
monitor adherence with recommendations in their jurisdic-
tions and consider implementing interventions to improve 
provider and patient compliance with gonorrhea treatment 
recommendations where indicated.
SSuN is a CDC-supported, sentinel surveillance project 
comprised of 10 selected state and city health departments 
that conduct investigations to collect supplementary informa-
tion on a random sample of gonorrhea cases reported from 
all health care providers/reporting sources in their jurisdic-
tions (https://www.cdc.gov/std/ssun/default.htm). These 
investigations include contacting the diagnosing provider to 
verify treatment and conducting patient interviews to collect 
behavioral and demographic information. Case weights were 
developed to account for local sample fractions and adjust for 
nonresponse by patient sex and age group, allowing CDC to 
produce estimates representative of all reported gonorrhea cases 
in these jurisdictions (3).
Analyses were restricted to seven of the 10 SSuN jurisdictions 
(Baltimore, Maryland; California, excluding San Francisco; 
Florida; Massachusetts; Multnomah County, Oregon; 
Minnesota; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) with documented 
treatment information (antimicrobials and dosages) for ≥90% 
of cases with complete investigations. Cases with missing 
patient treatment information (6.7%) were excluded from 
further analysis. Based on provider report of treatment pro-
vided, patients treated with the recommended dual therapy 
for uncomplicated gonorrhea (i.e., 250 mg dose of ceftriaxone 
[IM] plus 1 g dose of azithromycin [PO]) were classified as 
having received the recommended regimen. All other patients 
were classified as having received other regimens. Weighted 
estimates of the number and proportion of patients treated 
with the recommended regimen and corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Prevalence ratios 
(PRs) were estimated to identify differences in documented 
treatment by patient characteristics and diagnosing facility 
type. Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men 
(MSM) were defined as any male patient reporting male sex 
partners in the previous 2–3 months or reporting their sexual 
orientation as gay or bisexual.
In 2016, a total of 91,719 gonorrhea cases were reported in 
the seven participating SSuN jurisdictions. Among these, 8,393 
(9.2%) were randomly sampled; complete provider investiga-
tions were obtained for 3,213 cases for a response rate of 38%. 
Overall, 93.3% of these patients had a treatment documented 
and were included in the analysis.
Based on weighted analysis,* CDC estimated that 81.3% 
(95% CI = 79.2–83.4) of reported patients with gonorrhea in 
these SSuN jurisdictions were treated with the recommended 
dual therapy for uncomplicated gonorrhea (Table 1). The 
percentage of patients treated with this regimen varied by 
jurisdiction (range = 76.7% to 92.0%). There were no dif-
ferences by patient age or race/ethnicity (Table 2). Although 
not statistically significant, women were somewhat less likely 
than men to receive the recommended regimen (79.3% versus 
* Case weights developed based on proportion sampled in each jurisdiction; 
nonresponse adjustments developed by gender and age group. All analyses were 
conducted using statistical software with linearized Taylor-Series 95% 
confidence intervals.

82.5%; PR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.91–1.02). MSM were more 
likely to receive the recommended regimen compared with het-
erosexual men and women (84.8% versus 79.4%; PR = 1.07, 
95% CI = 1.01–1.13). Patients diagnosed with gonorrhea in 
family planning/reproductive health clinics were more likely 
to receive the recommended regimen than were patients 
diagnosed in other provider settings (93.8% versus 79.5%; 
PR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.13–1.23). Similarly, patients diagnosed 
in STD clinics were more likely to receive the recommended 
regimen than were patients diagnosed in other provider set-
tings (90.8% versus 79.8%; PR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.08–1.20). 
When stratified by sexual behavior, patients whose gonorrhea 
was diagnosed in STD and family planning/reproductive health 
clinics were more likely to be treated with the recommended 
regimen whether or not they were MSM.
Overall, 18.7% (95% CI = 16.6–20.8) of patients received 
other regimens (Table 1). The most frequent other regimens 
reported were ceftriaxone 250 mg only (5.9%), ceftriaxone any 
dosage and doxycycline (4.4%), and azithromycin only (3.1%). 
Fewer than 0.5% of patients were treated with a regimen sug-
gesting treatment of a patient with a cephalosporin allergy 
(e.g., azithromycin plus either gentamicin or gemifloxacin) 
or a patient with a complicated gonococcal infection (e.g., 
azithromycin plus either cefotaxime or ceftizoxime).
Discussion
CDC’s gonorrhea treatment recommendations are periodi-
cally revised based on the best available evidence of emerging 
trends in antimicrobial susceptibility. Provider awareness of, 
and adherence to current treatment recommendations helps 
ensure that all patients are treated with the most effective 
therapy and might decrease the development of antimicrobial 
resistance. Monitoring treatment practices across all provider 
and diagnostic settings helps identify opportunities for inter-
ventions to increase provider adherence. The current analysis 
provides estimates of treatment practices among all providers 
diagnosing gonococcal infections in seven of 10 SSuN juris-
dictions and are the first published estimates of adherence to 
CDC recommendations since gonorrhea treatment guidelines 
were revised in 2012 and in 2015 (2,4).
This analysis documents high levels of compliance with 
CDC treatment recommendations, with 81% of patients 
receiving recommended dual therapy for uncomplicated gon-
orrhea and substantiate high levels of compliance observed in 
previous analyses of gonorrhea cases reported in jurisdictions 
participating in SSuN during 2006–2008 and 2010–2012 
(5,6). Optimally, all patients diagnosed with uncomplicated 
gonorrhea should be treated with the recommended regimen to 
ensure effective treatment and to help forestall the emergence 
of antimicrobial resistance. However, in practice, many factors 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
CDC’s treatment recommendations for gonorrhea were revised 
in 2012 and 2015 based on emerging antimicrobial resistance. 
What is added by this report?
In 2016, 81% of gonorrhea cases in seven jurisdictions were 
treated with the recommended regimen for uncomplicated 
gonorrhea (250 mg dose of ceftriaxone [IM] plus 1 g dose of 
azithromycin [PO]), but this varied by provider type.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Providers should be aware of the national guidelines for the 
treatment of sexually transmitted infections. Monitoring of 
treatment practices is a critical public health priority to help assure 
that patients receive the highest quality of care, and to address the 
emerging threat of antimicrobial-resistant gonorrhea.
might influence provider’s adherence to the recommended 
regimen, including the availability of injectable medications 
at the time of treatment and patient-reported allergies. In the 
current analysis, patients diagnosed with gonorrhea in STD 
and family planning/reproductive health clinics were more 
likely to be treated with the recommended regimen than were 
patients diagnosed in other provider settings, similar to obser-
vations from earlier studies (7,8). Across all provider settings, 
MSM were more likely to be treated with the recommended 
regimen, and MSM were more likely than non-MSM to receive 
a diagnosis in STD clinics. However, in stratified analyses 
by sexual behavior and diagnosing facility type, STD clinics 
were still more likely to treat with the recommended regimen 
than were other provider types. Implementation of guidelines 
in other provider settings might be influenced by a smaller 
volume of patients with gonorrhea seeking care and services, 
as providers diagnosing fewer cases might be less familiar with 
current recommendations.
The majority of patients treated with other regimens were 
treated with only one antimicrobial, including 3% of all 
patients treated with azithromycin only and 1.2% with doxy-
cycline alone. Azithromycin monotherapy is not recommended 
for treatment of gonococcal infections because of concerns 
about emerging resistance and case reports of treatment failures 
(1,2,9). In addition, tetracycline has not been recommended 
as treatment regimen for gonorrhea since the 1980s because of 
established chromosomally and plasmid-mediated resistance in 
the United States (10). These findings reinforce the imperative 
for state and local jurisdictions to identify provider settings 
where patients are receiving inadequate treatment. Additional 
training and education on the importance of adherence to 
treatment recommendations might increase the proportion of 
patients adequately treated and further delay the emergence of 
antimicrobial-resistant gonorrhea.

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limi-
tations. First, findings are based on enhanced investigations 
conducted for a random sample of gonorrhea cases in seven 
jurisdictions; SSuN is not designed to be nationally repre-
sentative although these jurisdictions reported approximately 
20% of all gonorrhea cases in the United States in 2016. 
Second, although case weights were calculated to account for 
differing sample fractions across SSuN jurisdictions and for 
nonresponse, it is possible that unmeasured bias exists. CDC 
is unable to adjust these data for nonresponse by provider 
type because the complete distribution by provider type in the 
underlying population of cases is unknown. If providers who 
were less likely to treat patients with a recommended therapy 
were also less likely to respond to investigators, this analysis 
might overestimate the proportion of patients treated with 
the recommended regimen. Third, a small number of patients 
might have had allergies or other clinical scenarios that would 
have been appropriately treated with an alternative regimen; 
however, allergies and complications are not documented 
during SSuN investigations. Consequently, findings might 
underestimate the proportion of appropriately treated patients 
with gonorrhea. Finally, treatment information was missing for 
6.7% of sampled cases; it is plausible that these patients were 
treated with the recommended regimen, but investigators were 
unable to document treatment at the time of the investigation.
Despite the high level of treatment adherence documented 
in this analysis, improving provider adherence to treatment 
recommendations for antibiotic use across the full spectrum 
of health care settings is an integral part of a comprehensive 
approach to combating the emergence of antimicrobial-
resistant gonorrhea. State and local health departments should 
continue to work with the providers and patients to assure 
timely detection and treatment of gonorrhea according to 
current CDC treatment recommendations (2).
