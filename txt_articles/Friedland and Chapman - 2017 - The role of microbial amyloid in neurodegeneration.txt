Abstract
It has become apparent that the intestinal microbiota orchestrates important aspects of our
metabolism, immunity, and development. Recent work has demonstrated that the micro-
biota also influences brain function in healthy and diseased individuals. Of great interest are
reports that intestinal bacteria play a role in the pathogenic cascade of both Parkinson and
Alzheimer diseases. These neurodegenerative disorders both involve misfolding of endoge-
nous proteins that spreads from one region of the body to another in a manner analogous to
prions. The mechanisms of how the microbiota influences or is correlated with disease
require elaboration. Microbial proteins or metabolites may influence neurodegeneration
through the promotion of amyloid formation by human proteins or by enhancing inflamma-
tory responses to endogenous neuronal amyloids. We review the current knowledge con-
cerning bacterial amyloids and their potential to influence cerebral amyloid aggregation and
neuroinflammation. We propose the term “mapranosis” to describe the process of micro-
biota-associated proteopathy and neuroinflammation. The study of amyloid proteins made
by the microbiota and their influence on health and disease is in its infancy. This is a promis-
ing area for therapeutic intervention because there are many ways to alter our microbial
partners and their products, including amyloid proteins.
Neurodegenerative disorders remain a significant challenge for modern medicine and science.
Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and frontotemporal lobar
degeneration—as well as the less common disorders progressive supranuclear palsy, corticoba-
sal degeneration, and multisystem atrophy—all have common features. These diseases all have
sporadic forms that are responsible for �90% of cases [1]. The hallmark of these neurological
disorders is the misfolding, aggregation, and deposition of proteins in the brain [2]. Although
the misfolded and aggregated proteins are unique to each disorder, the biophysical properties
of the aggregates are conserved [2, 3]. The misfolded proteins adopt an ordered amyloid poly-
mer structure with prion-like properties [2], which is associated with sterile cerebral
inflammation.

 While certain genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in influencing the
risk of amyloid-related disorders, the causes remain largely unknown. The field has been
heavily influenced by work showing that proteins associated with neurodegeneration such as
amyloid-beta (Aß), alpha-synuclein, tau, and transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding pro-
tein 43 all adopt pathogenic cross–beta-sheet structures. Furthermore, these structures may be
transmitted between hosts and from one region of the brain to another in a manner similar to
prions [2]. This pathogenic spread hypothesis has received substantial experimental evidence,
but the initial event in the process is unknown [4–6]. While Prusiner has proposed that the pri-
mary misfolding event is stochastic [5], it has been suggested that the misfolding process asso-
ciated with Parkinson disease originates in the gut [7, 8].
Over the past 10 years, a remarkable series of studies has clearly demonstrated the role of a
new influence on the brain: that of our microbiota [9]. We are home to trillions of microbes
residing inside us and on all of our surfaces, with the largest concentration found in the gut
[10]. Our partner organisms are composed of bacteria, fungi, viruses, archaea, and parasites
with whom we have coevolved; their presence in our bodies is not accidental nor optional.
Most multicellular organisms on the planet have their own microbiome [11–14]. The human
microbiota is an imperative part of our metabolism, digestion, nutrition, development, immu-
nity, and protection from pathogens [15–17]. The functions of the microbiota in immunity are
best understood through an evolutionary lens: it is in the adaptive interest of our microbes to
maintain a state in which the host tolerates their colonization. It is also in the interest of the
host to maintain immune tolerance because the microbes contribute to our survival [15–17].
Furthermore, because of evolutionary conservation of molecular structures, exposure to the
microbiome and its products provides an excellent opportunity for disease to be created
through mechanisms of molecular mimicry [8]. The several influences of the microbiota on
the brain have now been established and a new concept of the gut–brain axis delineated (for
review see [9].)
The intestinal microbiota presents a dynamic living biome that presents a massive potential
threat requiring that a continuously vigilant state of surveillance be maintained. The surveil-
lance involves the sampling of intestinal content by epithelial microfold M cells, as well as den-
dritic cells, to convey antigens to immune cells in Peyer patches and other intestinal lymphoid
elements [18, 19] (Fig 1). Goblet cell–associated antigen passages (GAPS) are another route by
which antigens may access the immune system [20]. Moreover, it was recently found that
enteroendocrine cells, which are part of the gut epithelium, have properties of neurons and
connect directly to alpha-synuclein–containing nerves. It is also critical to recall that the gut
has a rich innervation, and there are more neurons in the gut than in the spinal cord [21]. The
bidirectional neuronal pathways between gut and brain provide a mode of entry of agents into
the brain from the microbiota that bypasses the circulatory system. This is one mode of entry
of prions into the central nervous system (CNS) [22] that may be involved in the neurodegen-
erative disorders as well. Considerable recent evidence suggests that the agent(s) triggering
Parkinson disease reside(s) in the microbiota: constipation is an early feature, and alpha-synu-
clein deposits are found in gut neurons in the disease. In addition, gut entry of agents trigger-
ing protein misfolding is the current understanding of the pathogenesis of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy and kuru [22]. If the gut is the site of origin of neurodegenerative disease path-
ogenesis and the gut home to the majority of the human microbiota, are there specific micro-
bial factors responsible for triggering disease?
Persons with Parkinson disease have altered bacterial populations [23–27]. The nonunifor-
mity of these results concerning the microbiota in the disease is not surprising, considering
dietary and methodological differences [26]. The finding that gut microbiota dysbiosis is
observed in patients effected by neurodegenerative diseases is consistent with earlier

 observations that alpha-synuclein pathology may originate in gut neurons and that early brain
pathology in Parkinson disease is found in the cell bodies of the neurons innervating the gut
(the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve) [7]. Furthermore, subjects with cognitive
impairment and brain amyloidosis as determined by amyloid imaging have been reported to
be colonized by more proinflammatory gut microbes as compared with controls [28]. These
results certainly suggest that there is a relationship between the gut microbiota and the genesis
of neurological disorders. As this field advances, it has become necessary to go beyond the
cataloging of bacterial populations, as suggested by Sharon et al. [10].
In 2002, Chapman et al. discovered that curli, extracellular fibers produced by Escherichia
coli and other enteric bacteria, share structural and biophysical properties with amyloids [29].
Curli were the first-described amyloid of a new and rapidly growing class of “functional” amy-
loids [30]. Work has now shown that there are many members of the human microbiome
capable of assembling extracellular amyloids, including Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Salmo-
nella, Mycobacteria, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, and Bacillus species. The production of amyloid
proteins by E. coli is highly regulated and functional, as cross–beta-sheet amyloid polymers
help bacterial cells bind to one another, form biofilms, and resist destruction by physical or
immune agents [31]. Despite a significant growth in our understanding of the production of
Fig 1. Potential areas of interaction between amyloid-producing bacteria and the gut. Microbial amyloid can engage TLRs on the epithelial surface
and prime systemic inflammation through the lymph follicles (Peyer patches) linked to M cells. This priming of the innate immune system via a
hematogenous route may cause enhanced response to neuronal amyloids in the brain. Microbial amyloid may also increase production of neuronal
amyloids (such as alpha-synuclein) though the neural connections of the enteroendocrine cells as well as the other epithelial cells. Neuronal amyloid
accumulation may be enhanced by exposure to microbial amyloid through increased expression and through cross-seeding, leading to misfolding of
neuronal proteins in the brain, in a manner analogous to kuru and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The submucosal and myenteric plexuses are shown
as a single structure for simplicity. TLRs, toll-like receptors.

 amyloid proteins in vitro, there have been few studies on the influence of bacterial amyloids in
the host.
A noteworthy series of recent papers have also documented a role of the microbiota in neu-
rodegeneration. In 2016, Minter et al. showed that antibiotic exposure lowers gut microbial
diversity and ameliorates amyloidosis and neuroinflammation in the APPSWE/PS1ΔE9 dou-
ble transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer disease [32]. In the same year, Chen et al. reported
an investigation of the role that bacterial amyloids may play in alpha-synuclein production
and aggregation in aged Fischer 344 rats and Caenorhabditis elegans. Rats exposed orally to E.
coli–producing curli were found to have enhanced alpha-synuclein production in the gut and
increased production and aggregation of alpha-synuclein in the brain [33]. Increased alpha-
synuclein accumulation was accompanied by enhanced cerebral inflammation when com-
pared with animals exposed to identical bacterial strains lacking the ability to produce curli.
Cerebral inflammation—with microgliosis, astroglosis, and up-regulation of toll-like receptor
(TLR) 2, interleukin 6, and tissue necrosis factor—were also observed in curli-exposed rats. It
has been previously shown that microbial amyloids, including curli, may induce immune
responses in the intestinal mucosa [34, 35] and regulate the intestinal epithelial barrier, influ-
encing bacterial translocation [36]. Chen et al. also found that transgenic C. elegans expressing
human alpha-synuclein exposed to curli-producing E. coli had enhanced alpha-synuclein
aggregation in muscle, as compared with animals exposed to curli-deficient E. coli [33].
Sampson and colleagues recently showed that the intestinal microbiota are needed for Lewy
body pathology, motor impairment, and microglial activation in alpha-synuclein–overexpres-
sing mice [37]. They found that microbes from Parkinson patients induce more motor
impairment in these animals compared with organisms from healthy persons. This work sug-
gests active gut–brain signaling by the microbiota [37]. Furthermore, APPPS1 transgenic mice
that overproduce Aß (models of Alzheimer disease) have been found by Harach et al. to harbor
altered gut bacteria, as compared with nontransgenic animals [38]. It was found that germ-free
Alzheimer disease transgenic mice had reduced pathology, and transfer of microbes from
transgenic animals reproduced cerebral Aß findings, but colonization from wild-type mice
was less able to enhance cerebral changes.
Bacterial and other amyloid proteins may cross-seed amyloid formation by neuronal pro-
teins [8, 33]. Prions—infectious amyloids—propagate through self-seeding in which a protein
in a prion conformation causes another molecule of the same protein to adopt an amyloid con-
formation [39]. There are many human proteins whose misfolding into amyloid is associated
with neurodegeneration. Disease-associated amyloid formation can be supported by self-seed-
ing, which accelerates the early kinetic stage of amyloidogenesis. The nature of prion seeding
has been an area of intense study that has revealed the existence of a species barrier in prion
propagation (i.e., prions from sheep are unable to induce prion formation in humans, and vice
versa). There are, however, several examples of amyloids capable of cross-seeding each other
[40–44]. Curli proteins from different bacterial species are capable of cross-seeding amyloid
formation both in vitro and in vivo [45, 46]. Lundmark et al. showed that exposure to curli
fibrils accelerates serum amyloid A amyloidosis in mice and suggested that curli may serve as a
template for fibril formation in vivo [45]. Furthermore, exposure to microbial amyloids in the
gut may enhance cerebral nucleation of Aß aggregates [33]. It has been demonstrated that dis-
ease proteins, such as alpha-synuclein or Aß, may have strain specificity in a manner analo-
gous to the strains of prion disease [47]. Various bacterial amyloids may elicit cross-seeding in
a strain-specific manner, which could account for the various phenotypes of the neurodegen-
erative disorders. Although cross-seeding has been documented in the lab, we know little
about the occurrence of cross-seeding in vivo.

 The cross-seeding of amyloid misfolding of alpha-synuclein and other related proteins may
access the brain directly through the autonomic nervous system in a manner similar to that
established for prion disease. For the cross-seeding mechanism to be involved, it is not neces-
sary for the microbial amyloid proteins to enter the brain themselves. Other pathogenic factors
originating from the gut in response to influences of the microbiota include cytokines, lym-
phokines, lipopolysaccharides, circulating immune cells, and hormones that may be delivered
to the brain via neural or hematogenous routes [48]. Access to the brain may also be obtained
directly through the nose because the olfactory bipolar cells reside outside the skull in close
proximity to the microbes in the roof of the nose. The nasal mucosa has been largely ignored
as an important regulatory site for CNS immune system homeostasis [49], and the organisms
residing there have just begun to be investigated [50]. Oral bacteria may also make amyloid
proteins, including the common oral symbiont Streptococcus mutans [51], and oral bacteria
have been linked to stroke and cerebral microbleeds (Fig 2) [52].
In order to enhance understanding of the influence of microbial amyloids on the body, we
propose a new term, “MAPRANOSIS.” This refers to the process (“osis”) of microbiota-associ-
ated proteopathy and neuroinflammation. We refer to “microbiota” instead of “bacteria”
because of the production of fungal and perhaps other nonbacterial microbial amyloids [53,
54]. Proteopathy refers to disease processes involving altered protein structures, which
includes amyloid misfolding and other configurations. Although we refer to neuroinflamma-
tion in the context of this review, we recognize that other forms of inflammation may also be
influenced by microbial amyloids.
In addition to amyloid cross-seeding between bacterial and human amyloidogenic proteins,
we must also consider alternative possible mechanisms by which microbial amyloids and
other products of the microbiota could influence neurodegenerative disorders.
1. The microbiota modulates immunological processes in the CNS
[9, 48]
Gut bacteria have been shown to influence microglia in the brain [55], and it has been sug-
gested that the microbiota in Parkinson disease is linked to a higher potential for inflammation
[26]. Of interest is the observation that bacterial amyloid is recognized by the innate immune
system as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern [56, 57], with a response involving TLRs 2
and 1, cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of acti-
vated B cells (NFкB), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) [56]. This pathway of
immune response is also involved in the recognition of misfolded alpha-synuclein or Aß [58,
59]. Increased expression of TLRs 2 and 4 has been reported on peripheral blood mononuclear
cells in Alzheimer disease [60]. Furthermore, microglial cell expression of CD14 is involved in
Aß clearance [48], and innate immune system activation by bacterial amyloid may alter Aß
homeostasis in the brain.
It has been suggested that exposure to bacterial amyloid proteins in the gut may cause prim-
ing of the immune system, thereby enhancing immune response to endogenous production of
neuronal amyloids in the brain [8]. This proposal was supported by the work of Chen et al.,
who found that animals exposed to bacteria producing the amyloid protein curli had higher
levels of cerebral inflammation, as compared with animals exposed to bacteria without the
ability to produce curli [33]. Neuroinflammation may be a key element in causing the disease
phenotype because many older subjects with cerebral amyloid deposits as evaluated by posi-
tron emission tomography or autopsy are not cognitively impaired [61]. Inflammatory
responses to the amyloid deposits in the brain may be influenced by the microbiota, and this
influence may be key to producing cerebral dysfunction [8].

 2. The microbiota may induce oxidative toxicity and inflammation
that contribute to neurodegeneration
Activation of TLRs 2 and 1 by bacterial amyloid is expected to enhance production of free radi-
cals through pathways involving CD14, NFкB, iNOS, and proinflammatory microRNAs [62].
Curli have been shown to activate iNOS [57, 63] as well as NFкB [56]. Rapinski et al. have
shown that curli fibers from Salmonella typhimurium bind to CD14, an adaptor molecule for
the TLR2-TLR1 complex [64]. The influence of the microbiota on the balance of oxidative
and/or reductive processes has only recently begun to be investigated [65].
3. Metabolites produced by the microbiome may be pathogenic or
salutogenic (health sustaining)
Sampson et al. proposed a role for short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by bacterial fer-
mentation in production of alpha-synuclein–mediated neuroinflammation [37]. And Unger
et al. have found a decrease in the concentrations of fecal SCFA in Parkinson subjects [27].
Further work in this area is clearly needed because microbial metabolites, such as SCFAs, may
pass the blood–brain barrier and have been shown to have important influences on systemic
immunity [66, 67]. Other metabolites that may be of interest include hydrogen sulfide, tri-
methylamine, neurotransmitters, lipopolysaccharide, bacterial lipoproteins, flagellin, and
organic acids [68]. Hydrogen sulfide can be a free radical donor or scavenger, and trimethyla-
mine has been linked to vascular disease, which is involved in Alzheimer disease as well as
other dementias [68]. There are further metabolites that await discovery because less than 20%
of the genes of our microbiota have a known specific metabolic function [69].
4. There is a complex interplay between the human host and its
resident microbiota
The influence of host genes on the microbiota may involve dietary choices, bile secretion, and
mucus barrier composition, as well as immunological pathways. It is now known that genetic
influences on the innate as well as the adaptive immune systems and other pathways influence
microbial populations [70, 71]. Cultural differences in human populations can also have a
profound influence on the microbiota, including birth practices, child-rearing, food prepara-
tion, personal hygiene practices, and diet. Where humans live can influence the composition
of the microbiota and thus neurodegeneration. Interestingly, several investigations have
reported that both Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease have a lower age-specific preva-
lence in Africa and India than in North America or Europe [72]. This may be related to die-
tary differences, with the higher consumption of vegetables and lower consumption of meat
in Africa and India being related to higher levels of fiber intake and production of SCFAs by
the microbiota, which enhances the creation of regulatory lymphocytes in the intestine that
have anti-inflammatory properties [73]. The crucial influence of global patterns of diet on the
microbiota has been demonstrated in a novel study of colon cancer [74]. Collectively, future
studies should strive to look beyond the CNS to comprehend the multifaceted factors respon-
sible for brain disorders associated with aging.
Several other questions are apparent concerning the potential role of microbial amyloids
and other products of the microbiota on brain disease.
Why are the neurodegenerative disorders so closely related to age?
Both Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease are known to have a prolonged course extend-
ing for decades from the early to the later stages. It has been documented that the oral

 transmission of prion disease, such as kuru, may involve an incubation period of >50 years
[72]. The enormous size of internal microbial populations and the slow nature of age-related
disease processes provide a great opportunity for both pathogenic and salutogenic processes to
occur. The late onset of Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease allows for minute alterations
in proteostasis and inflammation to have cumulative effects [75]. It may be that the presence
of bacterial amyloids produced by the gut microbiota shortens the time necessary for the devel-
opment of cerebral amyloids through nucleation of oligomer formation. Also, changes in the
immune and gastrointestinal systems with age may enhance the burden of microbial amyloids
and alter their influence on immune homeostasis.
What are the principal sources of microbial amyloid in humans?
The production of bacterial amyloid proteins by organisms known to be found in the gut are
well studied [46, 76–79]. However, the metaproteomic study of endogenous microbial amy-
loids present in the body has not been completed, and we know relatively little about microbial
amyloid assembly in the body. It will be necessary to include the production of amyloids by
fungal as well as bacterial members [53, 54], and new microbiome studies should consider the
taxonomic drivers of microbiota function, including the production of amyloid proteins [80].
What can be done in regard to prevention and therapy?
The role that intestinal microbes play during Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and related
disorders is a particularly dynamic pursuit because the composition and diversity of the micro-
biota are so variable in the human population. We are just beginning to see a plethora of
approaches involving prebiotics, probiotics, antibiotics, dietary interventions, fecal transplants,
and other means by which “gene therapy” of microbial nucleotide sequences can be accom-
plished [81]. Therapeutic approaches to neurodegenerative disease may someday include
adapting the gut bacteria to support salutogenic species and other means. We must ask if dis-
ease phenotypes can be modulated in persons after the initiation of disease [37]. Although pre-
vention is generally easier than cure, we should not assume a priori that the contribution of
the microbiota to neurodegeneration cannot be repaired. The plastic nature of the CNS and
the capability of recovery should not be underestimated.
A unique partnership of scientific disciplines is needed to understand the complex interac-
tions of human genes, diet, microbes, and aging. The diversity of bacteria, bacterial metabo-
lites, and dietary fibers and other nutrients has been linked to human health and aging [82].
Developments in the last few thousand years of human history have decreased our microbiome
diversity compared with that of our ancestors, with arguably negative consequences for our
health [83]. In addition to recognizing the importance of this biological diversity, we need also
to be aware of the need for a diversity of approaches to these multifaceted problems. It is not
likely that investigators working with a singular approach will provide both the questions and
the answers we need. The multidisciplinary nature of the processes by which our partner
organisms influence our health suggests that we realize how little we know and recall the say-
ing of James Clerk Maxwell, “Thoroughly conscious ignorance is the prelude to every real
advance in science.”
