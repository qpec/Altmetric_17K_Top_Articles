Healthcare personnel (HCP) attire is an aspect of the medical profession steeped in culture and tradition. The role of attire in cross-
transmission remains poorly established, and until more definitive information exists priority should be placed on evidence-based measures 
to prevent healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). This article aims to provide general guidance to the medical community regarding HCP 
attire outside the operating room. In addition to the initial guidance statement, the article has 3 major components: (1) a review and 
interpretation of the medical literature regarding (a) perceptions of HCP attire (from both HCP and patients) and (b) evidence for 
contamination of attire and its potential contribution to cross-transmission; (2) a review of hospital policies related to HCP attire, as 
submitted by members of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) Guidelines Committee; and (3) a survey of SHEA 
and SHEA Research Network members that assessed both institutional HCP attire policies and perceptions of HCP attire in the cross-
transmission of pathogens. Recommendations for HCP attire should attempt to balance professional appearance, comfort, and practicality 
with the potential role of apparel in the cross-transmission of pathogens. Although the optimal choice of HCP attire for inpatient care 
remains undefined, we provide recommendations on the use of white coats, neckties, footwear, the bare-below-the-elbows strategy, and 
laundering. Institutions considering these optional measures should introduce them with a well-organized communication and education 
effort directed at both HCP and patients. Appropriately designed studies are needed to better define the relationship between HCP attire 
and HAIs.

Healthcare personnel (HCP) attire is an aspect of the medical 
profession steeped in culture and tradition. From Hippoc-
rates's admonition that physicians' dress is essential to their 
dignity, to the advent of nurses' uniforms under the lead-
ership of Florence Nightingale, to the white coat ceremonies 
that continue to this day in medical schools, HCP apparel 
and appearance is associated with significant symbolism and 
professionalism. Recent years, however, have seen a rising 
awareness of the potential role of fomites in the hospital 
environment in the transmission of healthcare-associated mi-
croorganisms. Although studies have demonstrated contam-
ination of HCP apparel with potential pathogens, the role of 
clothing in transmission of these microorganisms to patients 
has not been established. The paucity of evidence has stymied 
efforts to produce generalizable, evidence-based recommen-
dations, resulting in widely disparate practices and require-
ments that vary by country, region, culture, facility, and dis-
cipline. This document is an effort to analyze the available 
data, issue reasonable recommendations, and describe the 
needs for future studies to close the gaps in knowledge on 
HCP attire. 
I N T E N D E D USE 
This document is intended to help acute care hospitals de-
velop or modify policies related to HCP attire. It does not 
address attire in the operating room (OR), perioperative ar-
eas, or other procedural areas and is not intended to guide 
HCP attire in those settings or in healthcare facilities other 
than acute care hospitals.

INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY 
FEBRUARY 2014, VOL. 35, NO. 2 
KEY AREAS ADDRESSED 
We evaluated and summarized the literature around 2 aspects 
of HCP attire (details are provided in "Methods"): 
I. Perception of both patients and HCP regarding HCP attire 
in relation to professionalism and potential risk for trans-
mission of microorganisms. 
II. Evidence for contamination of HCP attire and the po-
tential for HCP attire to contribute to the transmission 
of pathogenic microorganisms in hospitals. 
In addition, we performed a survey of the SHEA mem-
bership and SHEA Research Network to learn more about 
the policies related to HCP attire that are currently in place 
in members' institutions. 
GUIDANCE AND RECOMMENDATION 
FORMAT 
Because this topic lacks the level of evidence required for a 
more formal guideline using the GRADE system, no grading 
of the evidence level is provided for individual recommen-
dations. Each guidance statement is based on synthesis of 
limited evidence, theoretical rationale, practical consider-
ations, a survey of SHEA membership and the SHEA Research 
Network, author opinion, and consideration of potential 
harm where applicable. An accompanying rationale is listed 
alongside each recommendation. 
GUIDANCE 
STATEMENT 
There is a paucity of data on the optimal approach to HCP 
attire in clinical, nonsurgical areas. Attire choices should at-
tempt to balance professional appearance, comfort, and prac-
ticality with the potential role of apparel in the cross-trans-
mission of pathogens resulting in healthcare-associated 
infections (HAIs). 
As the SHEA workgroup on HCP attire, we recommend 
the following: 
I. Appropriately designed studies should be funded and 
performed to better define the relationship between HCP 
attire and HAIs. 
II. Until such studies are reported, priority should be placed 
on evidence-based measures to prevent HAIs (eg, hand 
hygiene, appropriate device insertion and care, isolation 
of patients with communicable diseases, environmental 
disinfection). 
III. The following specific approaches to practice related to 
HCP attire may be considered by individual facilities; 
however, in institutions that wish to pursue these prac-
tices, measures should be voluntary and accompanied by 
a well-organized communication and education effort 
directed at both HCP and patients. 
A. "Bare below the elbows" (BBE): This article defines 
BBE as HCP's wearing of short sleeves, no wristwatch, 
no jewelry, and no ties during clinical practice. Facilities 
may consider adoption of a BBE approach to inpatient 
care as an infection prevention adjunct, although the 
optimal choice of alternate attire, such as scrub uni-
forms or other short-sleeved personal attire, remains 
undefined. 
1. Rationale: While the incremental infection preven-
tion impact of a BBE approach to inpatient care is 
unknown, this practice is supported by biological 
plausibility and studies in laboratory and clinical set-
tings and is unlikely to cause harm. 
B. White coats: Facilities that mandate or strongly rec-
ommend use of a white coat for professional appearance 
should institute one or more of the following measures: 
1. HCP engaged in direct patient care (including house 
staff and students) should possess 2 or more white 
coats and have access to a convenient and economical 
means to launder white coats (eg, institution-pro-
vided on-site laundering at no cost or low cost). 
i. Rationale: These practical considerations may help 
achieve the desired professional appearance yet al-
low for HCP to maintain a higher frequency of 
laundering of white coats. 
2. Institutions should provide coat hooks that would 
allow HCP to remove their white coat (or other long-
sleeved outerwear) prior to contact with patients or 
the patient's immediate environment. 
i. Rationale: This practical consideration may help 
achieve the desired professional appearance yet 
limit patients' direct contact with potentially con-
taminated attire and avoid potential contamination 
of white coats that may otherwise be hung on in-
appropriate objects in the hospital environment. 
C. Other HCP apparel: On the basis of the current evi-
dence, we cannot recommend limiting the use of other 
specific items of HCP apparel (such as neckties). 
1. Rationale: The role played by neckties and other spe-
cific items of HCP apparel in the horizontal trans-
mission of pathogens remains undetermined. If neck-
ties are worn, they should be secured by a white coat 
or other means to prevent them from coming into 
direct contact with the patient or near-patient 
environment. 
D. Laundering: 
1. Frequency: Optimally, any apparel worn at the bed-
side that comes into contact with the patient or pa-
tient environment should be laundered after daily 
use. In our opinion, white coats worn during patient 
care should be laundered no less frequently than once 
a week and when visibly soiled, 
i. Rationale: White coats worn by HCP who care for 
very few patients or by HCP who are infrequently 
involved in direct patient care activities may need 
to be laundered less frequently than white coats 
 SHEA EXPERT GUIDANCE! HEALTHCARE PERSONNEL ATTIRE 
109 
worn by HCP involved with more frequent patient 
care. At least weekly laundering may help achieve 
a balance between microbial burden, visible clean-
liness, professional 
appearance, and resource 
utilization. 
2. Home laundering: Whether HCP attire for non-
surgical settings should be laundered at home or pro-
fessionally remains unclear. If laundered at home, a 
hot-water wash cycle (ideally with bleach) followed 
by a cycle in the dryer is preferable, 
i. Rationale: A combination of washing at higher tem-
peratures and tumble drying or ironing has been 
associated with elimination of both pathogenic 
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. 
E. HCP footwear: All footwear should have closed toes, 
low heels, and nonskid soles. 
1. Rationale: The choice of HCP footwear should be 
driven by a concern for HCP safety and should de-
crease the risk of exposure to blood or other poten-
tially infectious material, sharps injuries, and slipping. 
F. Identification: Name tags or identification badges 
should be clearly visible on all HCP attire for identifi-
cation purposes. 
1. Rationale: Name tags have consistently been identi-
fied as a preferred component of HCP attire by pa-
tients in several studies, are associated with profes-
sional appearance, and are an important component 
of a hospital's security system. 
IV. Shared equipment, including stethoscopes, should be 
cleaned between patients. 
V. No guidance can be offered in general regarding prohib-
iting items like lanyards, identification tags and sleeves, 
cell phones, pagers, and jewelry, but those items that 
come into direct contact with the patient or environment 
should be disinfected, replaced, or eliminated. 
METHODS 
Using PubMed/Medline, between the months of January and 
May 2013 we searched the English literature for articles per-
taining to HCP attire in clinical settings focusing on areas 
. outside the OR. We included all studies dealing with bacterial 
contamination and laundering of HCP attire, patients' and 
providers' perceptions based on the type of attire, and/or HCP 
footwear. 
Additionally, we reviewed and compared hospital policies 
related to HCP attire from 7 large teaching hospitals, as sub-
mitted by members of the SHEA Guidelines Committee. Fi-
nally, between February and May 2013 we sent out a survey 
to all SHEA members to assess their institutional HCP attire 
policies (if any) and to determine their perceptions of HCP 
attire as a vehicle for potential transmission of pathogens. 
RESULTS 
I. Patients' Perceptions of HCP Attire 
We identified 26 studies (published from 1990 onward) that 
examined patients' perceptions of HCP attire1 26 (Table 1). 
Most (23/26) studies surveyed patient preference for different 
types of HCP attire1"6,8"18'20"25 using either pictures of models 
in various dress styles3'4'7'9,1518,20,22"24 or descriptions of at-
tire_i.5,n,i4,2i,25 F o u r studies6'10'12,13 asked patients to assess the 
attire of their actual physicians. Attire descriptions and ter-
minology varied among studies (eg, "formal," "business," 
"smart," "suit and tie," and "dress") and will be referred to 
hereafter as "formal attire." We use "casual attire" to refer to 
anything other than formal attire. 
A. Formal attire and white coats: Most of the studies using 
pictures and models of HCP attire indicated patient pref-
erence for formal attire, which was favored over both 
scrubs1,3,7,9,18'22 and casual attire.7,9,15,16,19,22 However, several 
other studies revealed that physician attire was unlikely 
to influence patients' levels of comfort,4,20 satisfaction, 
trust, or confidence in physicians' abilities,2,4,9,19,2"'25 even 
if patients previously had expressed a preference for one 
type of attire.4'9,20'25 
Fifteen studies addressed white coats.1'4'7"9,11"17'20"22 In 10 
of these studies, patients preferred that physicians wear 
white coats,1,7"10,12,15"17 and in 1 study patients reported 
feeling more confident in those physicians.8 Similarly, 2 
studies showed a significant association between the pres-
ence of a white coat, especially on a female physician, and 
patients' trust and willingness to share sensitive infor-
mation.22 Patients also indicated less comfort in dealing 
with an informally dressed physician,16 describing a shirt 
and a tie as the most professional and desirable attire for 
physicians23"25 in addition to an overall well-groomed ap-
pearance.5,15 Moreover, the following items were deemed 
as inappropriate or undesirable: jeans,5'14 shorts,15 
clogs,1415 and open-toed sandals.15 In the remaining 5 
studies, patients showed no clear predilection for one dress 
style over another or did not consider a white coat either 
necessary or expected.4,11,13,20,21 
Five studies assessed patient satisfaction, confidence, or 
trust on the basis of their treating physicians' dress,2,6'10'12,13 
showing little response variations regardless of apparel. A 
survey of patients seen by obstetricians/gynecologists who 
were randomly assigned formal attire, casual attire, or 
scrubs found high satisfaction with physicians regardless 
of the group allocation.6 Similarly, in a before-and-after 
trial, emergency department (ED) physicians were asked 
to wear formal attire with a white coat one week followed 
by scrubs the subsequent week. Using a visual analog scale, 
patients rated their physician's appearance, professional-
ism, and satisfaction equally regardless of the week of 
observation.13 Another ED study found no difference in

Undesirability: clogs (84%), jeans (70%), trainers (67%), earrings (64%), long hair 
(62%), open-necked shirt (36%) 
Before education: no clear attire preference but did not favor scrubs (6%), poor 
agreement with Pt preference and what their MD wears 
After education: decrease preference for WC/tie/formal attire 
Conclusion: attire preferences may change with awareness for contamination 
Tension: WC group 42%, private clothes group 33% 
Satisfaction: no significant difference between attire groups 
WC preference: WC group (older Pts more likely to prefer WC) 71%, private 
clothes group 39% (P < .001) 
No significant difference in scores between 2 dress styles in appearance, satisfac-
tion, or professionalism

Selected MD in WC: children 69%, parents 66% 
Most appropriate and favored: name tag, WC, well groomed 
Neutral: scrubs, formal dress 
Not favored: open-toed sandals, clogs, shorts 
Formal dress favored (suit/tie or WC) 
28% would be unhappy seeing one of MDs shown, more likely those dressed 
informally 
64% thought how their MD dressed was important 
Practice to which a Pt belonged was an independent factor in Pt choice of dress 
WC and mask most popular overall but children favor casual attire 
Formal WC preferred over pediatric coat by parents and children 
Mask preferred over visor (eye contact potentially important) 
Before education: prefer formal for professionalism and approachability; prefer 
scrubs for hygiene, equal for identifiability; prefer formal dress overall 
After education: prefer scrubs (24% before to 62% after); formal preference de-
creased (52% before to 22% after) 
Authors' conclusions: if rationale behind modes of surgical dress are explained, Pts 
are more likely to prefer scrubs to formal clothes 
Pt confidence highest with "respectable" dress 
Loss of WC or tie did not deteriorate confidence significantiy 
Informal dress protocol "affront to sensitivities" and presence of nose ring most 
deleterious

patients' satisfaction with the care provided when their 
physicians wore white coats combined with either scrubs 
or formal attire.2 Similarly, 2 groups of patients who re-
ceived preoperative care by the same anesthesiologist 
wearing either formal attire for one group of patients or 
casual attire for the other found no differences in patient 
satisfaction between the groups.10 In contrast, one cross-
over trial involving physicians dressed in "respectable" or 
formal versus "retro" or casual attire found that patient 
confidence and trust were higher with the respectable-
dress protocol.19 Another study evaluating the attire of 
patients' treating physicians indicated preference for pol-
ished shoes and short hair for men, with jeans, clogs, 
trainers, and earrings on men being rated as undesirable.10 
A survey among Japanese outpatients indicated a pref-
erence for white coats but no significant difference in 
satisfaction levels based on attire when presented with 
physicians wearing white coats or "noninstitutional 
clothes."12 
B. BBE: Preference for BBE was assessed in 6 studies origi-

of the nationwide BBE policy13'23'25 and in 1 US study." 
In these 7 reports, patients did not prefer short sleeves. 
After informing patients of the BBE policy, older patients 
were more likely to prefer short-sleeved shirts without ties, 
while younger patients favored scrubs.1 After providing 
information about the potential for cross-contamination 
from shirt sleeve cuffs and neckties, responses changed 
from a preference for formal or long-sleeved attire to a 
preference for short sleeves or scrubs.1118'23 In addition, 
Shelton et al23 also found an association between physician 
gender and BBE attire: after a statement informing the 
participants of the potential cross-transmission of micro-
organisms by attire, patients preferred scrubs for female 
physicians but did not differentiate between scrubs and 
short-sleeved shirts for male physicians. 
C. Ties: Neckties were specifically addressed in several studies 
from the United Kingdom.5,21,24 In one study, patients re-
ported that attire was important but that neckties were 
not expected.21 Similarly, in a survey among individuals 
in the public concourse of a hospital, 93% had no ob-
jection to male physicians not wearing ties.5 None of these 
studies evaluated neckties in the context of patients' per-
ceptions of infection prevention. 
D. Laundering of clothes: In one study, patients identified 
"daily laundered clothing" as the single most important 
aspect of physicians' appearance.8 
E. Other factors: Several additional variables may influence 
patient preference for physician attire, including age of 
either the patient or the managing physician, gender of 
the practitioner, time of day, setting, and the attire patients 
are accustomed to seeing. In Japan, older patients were 
more likely to prefer white coats.12 Similarly, older patients 
in England found scrubs less appealing than did younger 
patients.8 Pediatric dental patients were more likely than 
their parents to favor casual attire.17 Patients preferred 
formal attire for senior consultants but thought that junior 
physicians should be less formal.1 Patients identified fe-
male physicians' attire as more important than the attire 
worn by male physicians.22 Formal attire was less desirable 
by patients seen during the night shift.9 Parents of children 
being seen in the ED favored surgical scrubs. Additionally, 
2 trials evaluated attire preference on the basis of what 
patients often see their HCP wearing. In one trial, patients 
accustomed to seeing their anesthesiologist in a suit were 
more likely to find suits and ties desirable.10 Similarly, the 
practice to which a patient belonged was found to be an 
independent factor in the patient's choice of preferred 
attire;16 however, another study found poor agreement be-
tween patient preferences and their physicians' typical 
attire.11 
In summary, patients express preferences for certain types 
of attire, with most studies indicating a predilection for formal 
attire, including a white coat, but these partialities had a 
limited overall impact on patient satisfaction and confidence 
in practitioners. This is particularly true in trials that eval-
uated the effect of attire on patient satisfaction in real-world 
settings. Patients generally do not perceive white coats, formal 
attire, or neckties as posing infection risks; however, when 
informed of potential risks associated with certain types of 
attire, patients appear willing to change their preferences for 
physician attire.1118 
II. HCP Perceptions regarding Attire 
Few studies evaluated HCP preferences with regard to at-
tire.5'6''4,26 While most studies addressed specific elements of 
HCP attire, one looked at the overall importance of attire 
and found that 93% of physicians and nurses versus 83% of 
patients thought that physician appearance was important for 
patient care (P < .001).26 
A. White coats: In a survey exploring perceptions of sur-
geons' apparel performed among surgeons themselves, in-
patients, and the nonhospitalized public, all 3 groups were 
equally likely to consider a white coat necessary and blue 
jeans inappropriate. Surgeons were more prone to con-
sider scrubs and clogs appropriate.14 In another survey of 
15 obstetricians/gynecologists, 8 preferred casual attire, 
while 7 preferred formal attire.6 Three studies assessed 
HCP alongside patient perception of infection risk or lack 
of hygiene associated with white coats, formal attire, or 
neckties,3,24'26 with one finding that HCP were more likely 
than patients to consider white coats unhygienic.26 
B. Ties: In a survey performed in a public concourse of a 
UK hospital, HCP were more likely than non-HCP to 
prefer physicians' wearing of neckties for reasons of 
professionalism.5 
C. Laundering of clothes: A recent survey showed that non-
surgical providers preferentially (and without prompting) 
 114

laundered their scrubs every 1.7 Â± 0.1 days (mean Â± 
standard error) compared with white coats, which were 
laundered every 12.4 Â± 1.1 days (P< .001); however, the 
reasons for this divergent behavior remain unclear.27 
III. Studies of Microbial Contamination of Apparel in 
Clinical and Laboratory Settings 
No clinical studies have demonstrated cross-transmission of 
healthcare-associated pathogens from a HCP to a patient via 
apparel; however, a number of small prospective trials have 
demonstrated the contamination of HCP apparel with a va-
riety of pathogens (Table 2).5'28"37 
A. White coats/uniforms: The 5 studies we evaluated indi-
cate that physician white coats and nursing uniforms may 
serve as potential sources of colonization and cross-trans-
mission. Several studies described contamination of ap-
parel with Staphylococcus aureus in the range of 5% to 
29%.30'33"35,38 Although gram-negative bacilli have also been 
identified, these were for the most part of low pathoge-
nicity;30'35 however, actual pathogens, such as Acinetobacter 
species, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas species, 
have been reported.38 
A number of factors were found to influence the mag-
nitude of contamination of white coats and uniforms. 
First, the degree of contamination was correlated with 
more frequent usage of the coat,35 recent work in the 
inpatient setting,34 and sampling certain parts of the uni-
form. Higher bacterial loads were found on areas of cloth-
ing that were more likely to come into contact with the 
patient, such as the sleeve.35 Additionally, the burden of 
resistant pathogens on apparel was inversely correlated 
with the frequency of lab coat change.38 Apparel contam-
ination with pathogenic microorganisms increased over 
the course of a single patient care shift. Burden et al28 
demonstrated that clean uniforms become contaminated 
within only a few hours of donning them. Similarly, a 
study testing nurses' uniforms at both the beginning and 
the end of their shifts described an increase in the number 
of uniforms contaminated with one or more microor-
ganisms from 39% to 54%, respectively. The proportion 
of uniforms contaminated with vancomycin-resistant en-
terococci (VRE), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 
and Clostridium difficile was also noted to increase with 
shift work.33 
In the first report of a positive correlation between 
contamination of hands and contamination of white coats, 
Munoz-Price et al39 cultured the hands, scrubs, and white 
coats of intensive care unit staff. The majority of bacteria 
isolated from hands were skin commensals, but HCP were 
also found to have contamination of hands, scrubs, and 
white coats with potentially pathogenic bacteria, including 
S. aureus, Enterococcus species, and Acinetobacter bau-
mannii. Among dominant hands, 17% of 119 hands were 
contaminated with one of these species, and staff members 
with contaminated hands were more likely to wear a white 
coat contaminated with the same pathogen. This associ-
ation was not observed with scrubs. 
B. BBE: Two observational trials evaluated the bacterial con-
tamination of HCP's hands on the basis of BBE attire 
versus controls, finding no difference in total bacterial 
counts or in the number of clinically significant patho-
gens.40'41 In contrast, Farrington et al,42 using a fluorescent 
method, examined the efficacy of an alcohol hand wash 
among BBE providers versus controls. The authors found 
decreased efficacy of hand hygiene at the wrist level in the 
non-BBE group, suggesting that the BBE approach may 
improve wrist disinfection during hand washing. 
The United Kingdom has adopted a BBE approach, on 
the basis of the theory that it will limit patient contact 
with contaminated HCP apparel and to promote better 
hand and wrist hygiene. However, a randomized trial com-
paring bacterial contamination of white coats against BBE 
found no difference in total bacterial or MRSA counts (on 
either the apparel itself or from the volar surface of the 
wrist) at the end of an 8-hour workday.28 
C. Scrubs: The use of antimicrobial-impregnated scrubs has 
been evaluated as a possible solution to uniform contam-
ination. In a prospective, randomized crossover trial of 
30 HCP in the intensive care unit setting,36 when com-
pared with standard scrubs, antimicrobial-impregnated 
scrubs were associated with a 4-7 mean log reduction in 
surface MRSA burden, although there was no difference 
in MRSA load on HCP hands or in the number of VRE 
or gram-negative bacilli cultured from the scrubs. The 
study did not assess the HAI impact of the antimicrobial 
scrubs. 
D. Ties: Several studies indicated that neckties may be col-
onized with pathogenic bacteria, including S. aureus. Lo-
pez et al31 reported a significantly higher bacterial burden 
on neckties than on the front shirt pocket of the same 
subject. In 3 studies, up to 32% of physician neckties grew 
S. aureus.5,11'37 Steinlechner et al37 identified additional po-
tential pathogens and commensals from necktie cultures, 
including Bacillus species and gram-negative bacilli. Two 
reports found that up to 70% of physicians admitted hav-
ing never cleaned their ties.5,31 
E. Laundering of clothes: Numerous articles published dur-
ing the past 25 years describe the efficacy of laundering 
hospital linens and HCP clothing,44 but most investiga-
tions of the laundering of HCP attire have employed in 
vitro experimental designs that may or may not reflect 
real-life conditions. A 2006 study45 demonstrated that 
while clothes lost their burden of S. aureus, they concom-
itantly acquired oxidase-positive gram-negative bacilli in 
the home washing machine. These bacteria were nearly 
eliminated by tumble drying or ironing. Similarly, inves-
tigators found that recently laundered clothing material 
acquired gram-negative bacteria from the washing ma-
 SHEA EXPERT GUIDANCE: HEALTHCARE PERSONNEL ATTIRE 
115 
chine, which were subsequently eliminated by ironing. An-
other in vitro study in the United Kingdom compared the 
reduction of microorganisms on artificially inoculated 
nurses' uniform material after washing at various tem-
peratures as well as with and without detergents. Washing 
uniforms contaminated with MRSA and Acinetobacter spe-
cies at a temperature of 60Â°C, with or without detergent, 
achieved at least a 7-log reduction in the bacterial burden 
of both microorganisms.46 There is no robust evidence 
that centralized industrial laundering decontaminates 
clothing more effectively than home laundering.43 
F. Footwear: Although restrictions on HCP footwear are in-
fluenced by a desire to meet patients' preferences for ap-
propriate attire,101415 most are driven by concerns for HCP 
safety.47"50 Studies have found that wearing of shoes with 
closed toes, low heels, and nonskid soles can decrease the 
risk of exposure to blood or other potentially infectious 
material,47,48,50'51 sharps injuries,48,50,52 slipping,50 and mus-
culoskeletal disorders.49 
Casual, open footwear, such as sandals, clogs, and foam 
clogs, potentially expose feet to injury from dropped con-
taminated sharps and exposure to chemicals in healthcare 
facilities. A comparison of needlestick injury surveillance 
data from the standardized Exposure Prevention Infor-
mation Network program revealed a higher proportion of 
hollow-bore needle injuries to the feet of Japanese HCP, 
with 1.5% of 16,154 total injuries compared with 0.6% of 
9,457 total injuries for US HCP (2.5 times higher; P < 
.001 ).48 Although multiple factors were linked to these in-
juries, one included the common practice in Japan to re-
move outdoor shoes and replace them with open-toed 
slippers on hospital entry. 
Footwear is an area of increased concern in the OR. 
The Association of perioperative Registered Nurses 
(AORN) recommends that OR footwear have closed toes 
as well as backs, low heels, and nonskid soles to prevent 
slipping.50 The US Occupational Safety and Health Ad-
ministration (OSHA) requires the use of protective shoes 
in areas where there is a danger of foot injuries from falling 
objects or objects piercing the soles.47 One study that mea-
sured the resistance of shoes to penetration by scalpels 
showed that of the 15 pairs of shoes studied, only 6 were 
made of material that was sharp resistant, including 
sneaker suede, suede with inner mesh lining, leather with 
inner canvas lining, nonpliable leather, rubber with inner 
leather lining, and thicker rubber.52 The OSHA bloodborne 
pathogens standard mandates that employers determine 
the workplace settings in which gross contamination with 
blood or body fluids is expected, such as the OR, and to 
provide protective shoe coverings in those settings.47,48,50,51 
Shoe covers are not meant to prevent transmission of bac-
teria from the OR floor; in fact, preliminary data show 
that the OR floor may play a dynamic role in the horizontal 
transmission of bacteria due to frequent floor contact of 
objects that then directly touch the patient's body (eg, 
intravenous tubing, electrocardiogram leads).53 
When HCP safety concerns or patient preference con-
flict with a HCP's desire for fashion, a facility's dress code 
can be the arbiter of footwear. OSHA allows employers to 
make such dress code determinations without regard to a 
worker's potential exposure to blood, other potentially in-
fectious materials, or other recognized hazards. 
IV. Outbreaks Linked to HCP Apparel 
Wright et al54 reported an outbreak of Gordonia potentially 
linked to HCP apparel. In this report, postoperative sternal 
wound infections with Gordonia bronchialis in 3 patients were 
linked to a nurse anesthetist. Gordonia was isolated from the 
HCP's scrubs, axillae, hands, and purse and from multiple 
sites on the HCP's roommate. 
V. Studies from Developing Countries 
In Nigeria, factors identified increasing the likelihood of bac-
terial contamination of white coats included daily laundering 
and use limited to patient care rather than nonclinical du-
ties.55 In India,56 medical students' white coats were assessed 
for bacterial contamination, paired with surveys about laun-
dering habits and attitudes toward white coats. Coats were 
contaminated most frequendy with S. aureus, followed by 
Pseudomonas species and coagulase-negative staphylococci. A 
similar trial of white coats used by staff in a rural dental clinic 
also revealed predominandy gram-positive contamination.57 
VI. Hospital Policies Addressing HCP Attire 
We reviewed and compared policies related to HCP attire 
from 7 large teaching hospitals or health systems. In general, 
policies could be categorized into 2 groups: 
A. General appearance and dress of all employees 
B. Standards for HCP working in sterile or procedure-based 
environments (OR, central processing, procedure areas, etc) 
Policies were evaluated for the following elements: 
A. Recommended clothing (eg, requirement for white coats, 
designated uniforms) or other options (eg, BBE) 
B. Guidance regarding scrubs 
C. Use of name tags 
D. Wearing of ties 
E. Requirements for laundering or change of clothing 
F. Footwear and nonapparel items worn or carried by HCP 
G. Personal protective equipment 
All institutions' human resources policies outlined general 
appearance or dress code requirements for professional stan-
dards of business attire; however, institutions varied in job-
specific policies and for the most part did not address more 
specific attire requirements except for OR-related activities. 
Few institutional policies included enforcement provisions. 
The institutions that required accountability varied from de-

tailing the supervisor's administrative responsibilities to more 
specific consequences for employee noncompliance. 
Three institutions recommended clothing (such as color-
coded attire) for specific types of caregivers (eg, nurses, 
nurses' assistants, etc). Policies specific to clinical personnel 
were most frequently related to surgical attire, including 
scrubs, use of masks, head covers, and footwear in restricted 
and semirestricted areas and surgical suites, and to central 
processing, as consistent with AORN standards. Scrubs were 
universally provided by the hospital in these settings. Laun-
dering policies clearly indicated that laundering of hospital-
provided scrubs was to be performed by the hospital or at a 
hospital-accredited facility. Use of masks, head covers, foot-
wear, and jewelry were generally consistent with AORN 
standards. 
Excluding surgical attire, only one institution provided 
guidance specific to physicians, outlining a recommendation 
for BBE attire during patient care. This policy specified not 
to use white coats, neckties, long sleeves, wristwatches, or 
bracelets. Institutional policies also varied in recommenda-
tions for laundering and change of clothing other than for 
surgical attire. No specific guidance was issued for other uni-
forms, other than cleanliness and absence of visible soiling; 
however, one institution referred to infection control speci-
fications for maintenance of clothing. Guidance regarding 
frequency of clothing change was variable for scrubs, from 
nonspecific requirements (eg, wearing freshly laundered sur-
gical attire on entry to restricted/semirestricted areas) to spe-
cific requirements (clean scrubs once per shift to once daily 
and if visibly soiled). In addition, most policies included in-
structions for HCP to remove scrubs and change into street 
clothes either at the end of the shift or when leaving the 
hospital or connected buildings. 
VII. Survey Results 
A total of 337 SHEA members and members of the SHEA 
Research Network (21.7% response of 1,550 members) re-
sponded to the survey regarding their institutions' policies 
for HCP attire. The majority of respondents worked at hos-
pitals (91%); additional facilities included freestanding chil-
dren's hospitals (4%), freestanding clinics (1%), and other 
facility types (5%), such as long-term acute care hospitals, 
multihospital systems, short-term nursing facilities, and re-
habilitation hospitals (rounding of numbers accounts for the 
sum of percentages being greater than 100). The majority of 
responses were from either university/teaching hospitals 
(39%) or university/teaching-affiliated hospitals (28%). We 
received additional responses from nonteaching hospitals 
(24%), Veterans Affairs hospitals (3%), specialty hospitals 
(2%), and miscellaneous facilities (4%). 
Enforcement of HCP attire policies was low at 11%. A 
majority of respondents (65%) felt that the role of HCP attire 
in the transmission of pathogens within the healthcare setting 
was very important or somewhat important. 
Only 12% of facilities encouraged short sleeves, and 7% 
enforced or monitored this policy. Pertaining to white coats, 
only 5% discouraged their use and, of those that did, 13% 
enforced or monitored this policy. For watches and jewelry, 
20% of facilities had a policy encouraging their removal. A 
majority of respondents (61%) stated that their facility did 
not have policies regarding scrubs, scrub-like uniforms, or 
white coats in nonclinical areas. Thirty-one percent re-
sponded that their hospital policy stated that scrubs must be 
removed before leaving the hospital, while 13% stated that 
scrubs should not be worn in nonclinical areas. Neckties were 
discouraged in 8% of facilities, but none monitored or en-
forced this policy. 
Although 43% of respondents stated that their hospitals 
issued scrubs or uniforms, only 36% of facilities actually laun-
dered scrubs or uniforms. A small number of hospitals pro-
vided any type of guidance on home laundering: 13% pro-
vided specific policies regarding home laundering, while 38% 
did not. 
In contrast to other items of HCP attire, half of facilities 
required specific types of footwear, and 63% enforced and/ 
or monitored this policy. 
DISCUSSION 
Overall, patients express preferences for certain types of attire, 
with most surveys indicating a preference for formal attire, 
including a preference for a white coat. However, patient 
comfort, satisfaction, trust, and confidence in their physicians 
is unlikely to be affected by the practitioner's attire choice. 
The ability to identify a HCP was consistently reported as 
one of the most important attributes of HCP attire in studies. 
This was particularly true in studies that evaluated the effect 
of attire of actual physicians on patient satisfaction in a real-
world setting rather than those assessing the influence of 
physician attire on patient satisfaction in the abstract. Patients 
generally did not perceive white coats, formal attire, or ties 
as posing infection risks; however, when informed of potential 
risks associated with certain types of attire, patients were 
willing to change their preferences for physician attire.1118 
Data from convenience-sample surveys and prospective 
studies confirm that contamination occurs for all types of 
HCP apparel, including scrubs, neckties, and white coats, with 
pathogens such as S. aureus, MRSA, VRE, and gram-negative 
bacilli. HCP apparel can hypothetically serve as a vector for 
pathogen cross-transmission in healthcare settings; however, 
no clinical data yet exist to define the impact of HCP apparel 
on transmission. The benefit of institutional laundering of 
HCP scrubs versus home laundering for non-OR use remains 
unproven. A BBE approach is in effect in the United Kingdom 
for inpatient care; this strategy may enhance hand hygiene 
to the level of the wrist, but its impact on HAI rates remains 
unknown. 
Hospital policies regarding HCP attire were generally con-
sistent in their approach to surgical attire; however, general 
 120 
INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY 
FEBRUARY 2 0 1 4 , VOL. 35, NO. 2 
dress code policies varied from guidance regarding formal 
attire to use of job-specific uniforms. Laundering and change 
of clothing was also not consistently addressed other than for 
surgical attire. Finally, accountability for compliance with the 
attire policies by HCP and supervisors was not routinely in-
cluded in the policies. 
AREAS FOR FUTURE 
RESEARCH 
I. Determine the role played by HCP attire in the horizontal 
transmission of nosocomial pathogens and its impact on 
the burden of HAIs. 
II. Evaluate the impact of antimicrobial fabrics on the bac-
terial burden of HCP attire, horizontal transmission of 
pathogens, and HAIs. Concomitantly, a cost-benefit anal-
ysis should be conducted to determine the financial merit 
of this approach. 
III. Establish the effect of a BBE policy on both the horizontal 
transmission of nosocomial pathogens and the incidence 
of HAIs. 
IV. Explore the behavioral determinants of laundering prac-
tices among HCP regarding different apparel and examine 
potential interventions to decrease barriers and improve 
compliance with laundering. 
V. Examine the impact of not wearing white coats on pa-
tients' and colleagues' perceptions of professionalism on 
the basis of HCP variables (eg, gender, age). 
VI. Evaluate the impact of compliance with hand hygiene 
and standard precautions on contamination of HCP 
apparel.
