ABSTRACT
Donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors are an important source of kidneys for transplantation, but
DCD donor transplantation is less common in the United States than in other countries. In this study of
national data obtained between 2008 and 2015, recovery of DCD kidneys varied substantially among the
country’s 58 donor service areas, and 25% of DCD kidneys were recovered in only four donor service areas.
Overall, 20% of recovered DCD kidneys were discarded, varying from 3% to 33% among donor service
areas. Compared with kidneys from neurologically brain dead (NBD) donors, DCD kidneys had a higher
adjusted odds ratio of discard that varied from 1.25 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.16 to 1.34) in
kidneys with total donor warm ischemic time (WIT) of 10–26 minutes to 2.67 (95% CI, 2.34 to 3.04) in
kidneys with total donor WIT .48 minutes. Among the 12,831 DCD kidneys transplanted, kidneys with
WIT#48 minutes had survival similar to that of NBD kidneys. DCD kidneys with WIT.48 minutes had a
higher risk of allograft failure (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.41), but this risk was limited to kidneys
with cold ischemia time (CIT) .12 hours. We conclude that donor service area–level variation in the re-
covery and discard of DCD kidneys is large. Additional national data collection is needed to understand the
potential to increase DCD donor transplantation in the United States. Strategies to minimize cold ischemic
injury may safely allow increased use of DCD kidneys with WIT.48 minutes.

Donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors are
an increasingly important source of transplantable
organs. The proportion of DCD kidney donors in
the United States increased from 7.3% in 2005 to
17.7% in 2015.1 However, kidney transplantation
from DCD donors in the United States remains
lower than in other countries, where DCD donors
are also primarily Maastricht Criteria Category 3
donors (i.e., controlled donors).2 For example, in
2013, 13.6% of deceased donor kidney transplants
in the United States were from DCD donors com-
pared with 40% in the United Kingdom.3,4
Unlike kidneys from neurologically brain dead
(NBD) donors, DCD donor kidneys are subject to
warm ischemic injury that increases the risk of
delayed graft function (DGF) and may compromise
long-term allograft survival. Therefore, warm ische-
mictime(WIT)maybeanimportantfactoraffecting
the acceptance of DCD donor kidneys for transplan-
tation. In addition, donor service area (DSA)–level
variation in acceptance practices is an important
factor in the use of NBD donor kidneys for trans-
plantation and may also be important in the DCD
setting.5

 transplantation in the United States and specifically focused on
the effect of total donor WIT (defined as time from withdrawal
of life-sustaining therapy (WLST) to the initiation of cold
perfusion) (Figure 1) and DSA-level practice variation.
RESULTS
Recovery of DCD Kidneys
Between January 1, 2008 and December 2, 2015, there were
n=16,027 kidneys recovered from DCD donors $20 kg
(n=107 kidneys from DCD donors ,20 kg were excluded
from study). Among the n=58 DSAs, the number of DCD
kidneys recovered varied from 0 to 1072 (median =216),
25% of DSAs recovered fewer than ten DCD kidneys per
year, and 25% of all DCD kidneys were re-
covered in only four DSAs. Among DSAs
that recovered at least one DCD kidney, the
proportion of kidneys recovered from
DCD donors varied from 1% to 32% (me-
dian =13%; quartile 1, quartile 3 =8, 19)
between DSAs (Figure 2).
DSA Characteristics and Use of DCD
Donors
Table 1 compares selected DSA character-
istics between DSA quartiles defined by the
proportion of DCD donors among all de-
ceased donors identified in the DSA during
the study period. The time between the
date of hospital referral of a potential do-
nor to the organ procurement organization
(OPO) and date of declaration of death was
clinically similar in DSA quartiles ranked
by the proportion of DCD donors. The donor conversion
rate, defined as the proportion of eligible donors converted
to actual NBD donors, was also similar between DSAs quar-
tiles. The proportion of DCD donor kidneys shipped outside
the DSA for transplantation was higher in DSAs with a lower
proportion of DCD donors during the study period.
Discard of DCD Kidneys
Among recovered DCD kidneys, n=3196 (20%) were discar-
ded. In comparison, n=17,221 of the 94,047 (18%) recovered
NBD kidneys were discarded (P,0.001). The proportion of
DCD kidneys discarded in a DSA varied between 3% and 33%
(Figure 3) and was related to the proportion of NBD kidneys
discarded within individual DSAs (Pearson correlation coef-
ficient =0.61; P,0.001). In 34 of 58 DSAs, the DCD discard
rate was higher than the NBD discard rate
(denoted by the black circles in Figure 3).
Table 2 shows the proportion of DCD
kidneys discarded in the DSA at the 10th
and 90th percentiles of discard in sub-
groups defined by total donor WIT, kidney
donor profile index (KDPI), use of ma-
chine perfusion, and use of donor biopsy.
Discard was more variable among donor
kidneys with a longer total donor WIT, kid-
neys with higher KDPI, kidneys not treated
with machine perfusion, and kidneys eval-
uated by biopsy.
Table 3 compares the proportion of
DCD and NBD kidneys discarded. In the
first, second, and third KDPI quartiles, the
proportion of DCD discards was higher
than the proportion of NBD discards, sug-
gesting that DCD kidneys may have been
considered inferior to NBD kidneys with
the same KDPI, although DCD is accounted

 for in the calculation of the KDPI, and DCD kidneys
otherwise have more favorable donor characteristics than
NBD donor kidneys with the same KDPI. Considering indi-
vidual factors, the proportion of DCD discards was higher in
most subgroups, with the largest difference in DCD versus
NBD discard observed among hepatitis C antibody–positive
donor kidneys and kidneys not treated with machine
perfusion. The proportion of DCD versus NBD discards did
not differ in subgroups defined by factors associated with an
increased risk of DGF or allograft failure, such as donor age
$65 years old, terminal serum creatinine .1.5 mg/dl, donor
history of hypertension, or diabetes. Kidneys evaluated by a
biopsy were the only subgroup in which the proportion of
DCD discards was lower than the proportion of NBD discards.
A longitudinal increase in DCD versus NBD
discard was not observed, and the propor-
tion of DCD discards did not increase over
time in any of the subgroups examined
(data not shown).
Total Donor WIT and Discard
The total donor WIT could not be calcu-
lated for n=560 DCD kidneys. Among the
15,467 kidneys for which total donor WIT
could be calculated, the times ranged from
10 to 174 minutes, and the 50th, 75th, and
90th percentiles of WITwere 26, 34, and 48
minutes, respectively. Time to death (cal-
culated from time of withdrawal to time of
death) (Figure 1) was a median of 69%, and
quartile 1, quartile 3 = 57, 81 of the total
donor WIT. The proportions of DCD kid-
neys discarded with total donor WITof 10–
26, 27–34, 35–48, and .48 minutes were
16%, 20%, 25%, and 29%, respectively.
Table 4 shows that DCD kidneys had a
higher-adjusted odds of discard compared
with NBD kidneys and that the odds of dis-
card were higher in DCD kidneys with
longer total donor WITs. Figure 4 shows
that the higher odds of discard among
DCD kidneys compared with NBD kid-
neys varied between KDPI subgroups by
total donor WIT. When total donor WIT
was .48 minutes, DCD kidneys had higher
odds of discard in all KDPI subgroups.

 KDPI 0%–25% group, the threshold of total donor WIT asso-
ciated with a higher odds of DCD kidney discard was 27 min-
utes (the 95% confidence interval for kidneys with total donor
WIT 27–34 minutes and KDPI 76%–100% crossed 1.0 because
of a limited number of kidneys in this group; n=334).
Table 5 shows factors associated with DCD kidney discard
after accounting for DSA-level variation in discard practices.
Longer total donor WIT, donor age $18 years old (compared
with donors 12–17 years old), women donors, body mass index
,25 kg/m2, donor hypertension, diabetes, nontraumatic cause
of death, terminal serum creatinine .1.5 mg/dl, hepatitis C
antibody positivity, use of donor biopsy, and nonuse of machine
perfusion were associated with a higher odds of discard.
Kidney Transplant Outcomes
The cumulative incidence of all-cause graft loss (ACGL),
death-censored graft loss (DCGL), and death with a function-
ing graft (DWFG) in DCD donor recipients grouped by total
donor WIT compared with NBD donor recipients is shown in
Figure 5. In these unadjusted analyses, the incidence of ACGL
and DWFG was higher in patients who received a DCD donor
transplant with total donor WIT of 34–48 and .48 minutes.
The 1-year cumulative incidence rates of ACGL in DCD re-
cipients with total donor WIT 34–48 and .48 minutes were
9.0% and 8.9% compared with 6.7% in NBD recipients (in-
cluding the 3.3%, 3.1%, and 2.2% of patients who had pri-
mary nonfunction in each of these groups, respectively).
Table 6 shows that there was no difference in adjusted risk
of ACGL, DCGL, or DWFG in DCD donor recipients with
total donor WIT #48 minutes compared with patients who
received an NBD donor transplant. DCD recipients with total
donor WIT .48 minutes had an increased risk of ACGL and
DWFG but were not at increased risk for the outcome of
DCGL compared with NBD donor recipients.
Of interest, the n=1035 DCD recipients with total donor
WIT .48 minutes were not at increased risk of ACGL when
cold ischemia time (CIT) was ,12 hours (hazard ratio, 1.17;
95% confidence interval, 0.84 to 1.62) but were at increased
risk for ACGL when CIT was $12 hours (hazard ratio, 1.25;
95% confidence interval, 1.07 to 1.45; P=0.02 for the interac-
tion of DCD recipients with total donor WIT .48 minutes 3
CIT). We were unable to determine the adjusted risk of ACGL
in the subgroup of DCD recipients with total donor WIT .48
minutes who were also treated with machine perfusion due to
the small number of patients in this group (n=177). The as-
sociation of total donor WIT .48 minutes with ACGL was
consistent in subgroups with KDPI$26% (Table 7).
DISCUSSION
The study identifies opportunities to increase the utilization of
DCD donor kidneys for transplantation but also highlights the
need for additional national data to improve understanding of
DCD donor kidney utilization. We found dramatic DSA-level
variation in both the recovery of DCD kidneys and the discard
of recovered DCD kidneys. Understanding of the reasons for
theDSA-level variationintherecoveryofDCDdonorsremains
incomplete in our analysis. Failure to wait for patients with
severe brain injury to progress to neurologic brain death could
inflate the proportion of DCD donors; however, we found no
evidence that this was a factor contributing to the observed
DSA-level variation in use of DCD donors. We also did not
find an association between OPO performance in recovery of
NBD donors and recovery of DCD donors. DSAs with lower
utilization of DCD donors more frequently shipped DCD do-
nor kidneys to transplant centers outside their DSA, suggesting
that regional differences in acceptance of DCD donor organs

 contribute to differences in the use of DCD donors. Further
studies are needed to understand the DSA-level variation in
DCD donors observed in our study. Compared with NBD
kidneys, DCD kidneys had a higher odds of discard; the
odds of discard were greatest in DCD kidneys with total donor
WIT .48 minutes, but DCD kidneys with shorter total donor
WITs also had a higher odds of discard in subgroups with
KDPI.25%. Total donor WIT was independently associated
with DCD discard, but among DCD kidneys used for trans-
plantation, only those with total donor WIT .48 minutes
were at increased risk of allograft failure; also, there was no
evidence that total donor WIT had a differential effect on
allograft failure in kidneys of different quality defined by
KDPI quartile. The increased risk of allograft failure in DCD
kidneys with total donor WIT .48 minutes was limited to
patients with CIT.12 hours, suggesting the importance of
strategies to limit CIT.
There is limited information regarding the utilization of
DCD kidneys. In an analysis of 62,983 deceased donor kidneys
recovered in the United States between 1999 and 2005, DCD
donorkidneyshadathreefoldhigheroddsofdiscardcompared
with NBD donor kidneys.5 This study was conducted in an era
when experience with DCD was limited and only 4.1% of the
kidneys were from DCD donors. In an analysis of n=896 DCD

 kidneys that met expanded criteria donor criteria (i.e., ECD/
DCD kidneys) in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recip-
ients (SRTR) between 2000 and 2011, 48% were discarded.6
Neither study examined the association of WIT or DSA-level
practice variation with DCD kidney utilization. In addition to
WIT and DSA-level practice variation, the study confirmed
nonuse of machine perfusion and use of donor biopsy as po-
tentially modifiable factors associated with the kidney
discard.5
Our study determined WIT from the time of withdrawal of
WLSTuntil the onset of cold perfusion (also known as the total
donor WIT),7 which should be differentiated from functional
WIT that attempts to capture the onset of significant ische-
mia injury to donor organs by the use of vital signs, such as a
sustained drop in the donor’s BP or hypoxia (Figure 1). The
threshold of BP and oxygenation at which organs sustain sig-
nificant ischemic insult is likely affected by a variety of factors,
including the age of the donor, leading to a variety of defini-
tions of the functional ischemic time in the literature.8–11 Al-
though the SRTR reports the estimated functional WIT, these
data are not validated and defined by sustained onset of un-
stable physiologic parameters that often fluctuate and may
render the data inaccurate. We, therefore, elected to use the
total donor WIT, because it is reliably defined from the time of
WLST. Current recommendations suggest that total donor
WIT should not exceed 60 minutes for kidney transplanta-
tion.12,13 However, these recommendations assume the onset
of significant ischemia rapidly after WLST (Figure 1), which
may or may not occur in individual potential DCD donors. It
is important to recognize that the total donor WITs reported
in this study may include periods of time when the donor
organs were not subject to significant ischemic insult. There
is limited evidence that functional WITmay be a more impor-
tant determinant of transplant outcome than total donor
WIT.10 However, the upper limit of functional WIT compat-
ible with successful kidney transplantation remains uncertain.
Reid et al.14 reported that an agonal phase duration up to 60
minutes (i.e., the time between the onset of hemodynamic and
respiratory instability until circulatory arrest in Figure 1) was
not associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes,
including DGF and lower kidney allograft function, at 12
months. Recent studies have suggested
that examination of donor hemodynamic
factors after WLSTmay be useful in predict-
ing post-transplant outcome.15 The upper
limit of functional WIT compatible with
successful kidney transplantation is likely
higher than for extrarenal organs, because
kidneys maintain perfusion in the setting of
hypotension through autoregulation. The
implications of this fact are that implemen-
tation of a uniform upper time limit of
functional WIT for utilization of all organs
may result in nonrecovery of viable DCD
kidneys. Our study highlights the need for
improved national data collection as well as
dedicated studies to define the upper limit
of functional WIT compatible with kidney
transplantation.
Our analysis is limited to kidneys that
were recovered and does not capture poten-
tial DCD donors who did not progress to
circulatory arrest in a timeframe feasible for
organ donation. There is significant vari-

 ability in the time to cessation of circulatory function in pro-
spective DCD donors.16 Most DCD protocols in the United
States recommend a maximal period of 60 minutes from
WLST to circulatory arrest.7,12 Potential donors may maintain
hemodynamic stability for significant periods of time after
WLST. Therefore, the 60-minute limit on the basis of practical
considerations, including the feasibility of reserving valuable
health care resources such as surgical teams and operating
room resources, may lead to premature discontinuation of
DCD withdrawal protocols and nonrecovery of transplant-
able kidneys. In a single-center analysis from the United
Kingdom, a protocol of extending the minimum waiting
time after WLST from 1 to 4 hours resulted in a 30% increase
in DCD kidney transplantation.14 In a recent study of nearly
300 DCD kidney transplants at the University of Wisconsin,
extending the waiting time from WLST to declaration of
death to 2 hours resulted in 9.8% more transplants.17 The
current SRTR OPO performance metrics evaluating the con-
version of potential donors to actual donors are limited to
NBD donors. The large DSA-level variation in the recovery of
DCD kidneys in our study highlights the need for additional
national data capture including potential DCD donors who
do not progress to circulatory arrest during the current 60-
minute time limit to fully understand the opportunity for
increasing the utilization of DCD kidneys for transplantation
in the United States.
Despite a higher incidence of DGF, DCD kidney transplant
function and survival are generally reported as comparable
with those from NBD donors.18–21 Our findings extend these
observations by examining the effect of total donor WIT on
DCD transplant outcomes. The study findings of a minimal
effect of total donor WITon kidney transplant outcomes until
total donor WIT exceeded 48 minutes and the absence of a
differential effect of total donor WITon outcomes in kidneys
of varying quality are provocative but should be interpreted
with the understanding that these observations are among
kidneys that were carefully selected for transplantation. The
observation that the association of total donor WIT .48 min-
utes with allograft failure was mitigated in patients with
CIT,12 hours challenges current recommendations that
CIT be limited to 24 hours for DCD kidneys.12 Previous
work has shown that DCD kidneys tolerate CIT poorly, and
strategies to minimize CIT to ,12 hours may lead to increased
utilization of DCD kidneys.22,23 We did not find a differential
effect of total donor WIT .48 minutes on allograft survival in
kidneys with higher KDPI, suggesting that there is potential to
safely increase utilization of high-KDPI kidneys with total do-
nor WIT .48 minutes.
In summary, there was large DSA-level variation in the
recovery and discard of DCD kidneys in the United States.
DCD kidneys had a higher odds of discard compared with
NBD kidneys, and longer total donor WITs were associated
with DCD discard. However, only total donor WIT .48
minutes was associated with a modest increased risk of allo-
graft failure, and this risk may be modified by limiting CIT to
,12 hours. Overall, DCD kidneys provided excellent allo-
graft survival, with 5-year survival of 75% even among kid-
neys from donors .48 minutes. Improved national data
collection is needed to inform future strategies to increase
kidney transplantation from DCD donors in the United
States.

 Data Source and Study Inclusion Criteria
ThisanalysisisonthebasisofdatafromtheSRTRfromJanuary1,2008
to December 2, 2015. The SRTR data system includes data on all
donors, waitlisted candidates, and transplant recipients in the United
States submitted by the members of the Organ Procurement and
Transplantation Network (OPTN). The Health Resources and Ser-
vices Administration, US Department of Health and Human Services
providesoversighttotheactivitiesoftheOPTNandSRTRcontractors.
Only kidneys from deceased donors weighing $20 kg (.99% of total
donor population) were included in this analysis. The study included
n=356 kidneys from n=712 (2%) uncontrolled DCD donors. Survival
analyses excluded multiorgan and dual transplant recipients.
Definitions
Total Donor WIT
The SRTR reports information to allow the calculation of the total
donor WIT defined as the time from WLSTuntil the time when core
cooling is initiated (Figure 1).
DSA
DSA is an area designated by the Centers Medicare and Medicaid
Services to be served by a single OPO.
Discard
A deceased donor kidney was considered discarded if it was recovered
for the purposes of transplantation but was not used for transplan-
tation. Dual kidney transplants (i.e., the transplantation of two kid-
neys into a single donor) were not counted as discards.
The KDPI
The KDPI was determined by calculating the ten-variable Kidney
Donor Risk Index (KDRI). Cut points for KDPI quartiles were on
the basis of the standardized 2015 KDRI values of deceased kidney
donors recovered for transplantation.11
Primary Nonfunction
Primary nonfunction was defined by the outcome of death-censored
allograft failure within 90 days of transplantation.
Figure 5. The incidence of all cause graft failure, and death with a functioning graft was higher in patients who received a DCD donor
transplant with total donor warm ischemic time of 34–48 and . 48 minutes. Cumulative incidence curves including 76,826 NBD kidney
transplant recipients. The numbers of DCD recipients in subgroups with total WIT 10–26, 27–34, 34–48, and .48 minutes were 6555,
3160, 1680, and 1044, respectively.

 Descriptive Statistics
DSA-Level Variation in the Use of DCD Donor Kidneys
The number and proportion of DCD donor kidneys among all de-
ceased donor kidneys recovered for transplantation in each of the 58
DSAs were determined.
To understand the DSA-level variation in the
useofDCDdonors,DSAsweregroupedintoquar-
tiles on the basis of the proportion of DCD do-
nors among all deceased donors recovered in the
DSA during the study period. To determine if dif-
ferencesinwaitingforpotentialdonorstoprogress
toneurologicbraindeathcontributedtoDSA-level
variation in DCD donation, the time (in days)
between hospital referral to the OPO and decla-
rationofdeathwascomparedbetweenDSAquar-
tiles. To determine an association between OPO
performance in NBD donation and DCD dona-
tion,wecomparedthedonorconversionrate(the
proportion of eligible donors converted to actual
NBD donors) reported by the SRTR in 2013–
2015 between DSA quartiles. Finally, to deter-
mine if acceptance of DCD donors by transplant
centers within the DSA contributed to the DSA-
level variation in DCD donors, we compared the
proportion of DCD kidneys shipped outside the
DSA between DSA quartiles.
We plotted the proportion of DCD and NBD
donor kidneys discarded in each DSA and deter-
minedthecorrelationbetweenDCDandNBDdis-
card within DSAs using the Pearson Correlation
Coefficient. The effect of DSA-level discard prac-
tices was determined by comparing the propor-
tions of kidneys discarded in DSAs within the
highest and lowest deciles of discard in subgroups
definedby totaldonorWIT,KDPI,useofmachine
perfusion, and use of a donor kidney biopsy.
Factors Associated with Kidney Discard
The number and proportion of DCD and NBD
kidneys discarded were determined in strata de-
fined by donor age (,12, 12–17, 18–39, 40–49,
50–59, 60–64, or $65 years old), donor body
mass index (,25, 25–29.9, or $30 kg/m2), do-
nor race (black or nonblack), donor history of
hypertension, donor history of diabetes, donor
cause of death (cerebrovascular accident, an-
oxia, head trauma, or other), donor preterminal
serum creatinine (#1.5 or .1.5 mg/dl), donor
hepatitis C antibody positivity, year of donation,
use of machine perfusion, and the use of a donor
kidney biopsy. In addition, we determined the
number and proportion of DCD kidneys discar-
ded in categories of total donor WIT. Categories
of total donor WITwere determined on the basis
of the underlying distribution of the total donor
WIT for DCD kidneys: The cut points of 26, 34, and 48 minutes
reflect the 50th, 90th, and 95th percentiles of total donor WIT.
The adjusted odds ratio of discard of DCD kidneys compared with
NBD kidneys was determined in a generalized linear model using the
logit link. These models account for correlation in use between kidneys

 from the same donor.24 The regression models adjusted for differences
in individual factors within the KDPI equation (donor age, race, diabe-
tes, hypertension, cause of death, hepatitis C antibody positivity, pre-
terminal serum creatinine, body mass index in kilograms per square
meter, year of donation, use of machine perfusion, and use of a donor
kidney biopsy). Similar models were used to determine the adjusted
odds ratio of discard of DCD kidneys in successively longer categories of
total donor WIT compared with NBD donor kidneys. Additional sub-
group analyses were stratified by quartile of the KDPI.
Risk of Graft Loss
Cumulative incidence curves were used to determine the time to
allograft failure from ACGL, DCGL, and DWFG in DCD transplant
recipients stratified by total donor WIT compared with NBD kidneys.
Group differences were determined by the log rank test.
Separate Cox multivariate regression models were used to deter-
mine the independentassociation of donor type(DCDsubgroupedby
duration of total donor WIT compared with NBD) with allograft
failure from any cause, including death, DCGL, and DWFG after
adjustment for differences in recipient factors (age, sex, race, cause
of ESRD, duration of pretransplant dialysis exposure, and panel re-
active antibody), transplant factors (HLA mismatch, use of induction
therapy, CIT, and the use of machine perfusion), and donor factors
summarized by KDPI quartile. In the models, the intercluster corre-
lation between deceased donor kidneys from the same donor was
accounted for using the robust sandwich covariance matrix.25,26
For all Cox models, variables with missing data were assigned a
category of missing, and the proportional hazards assumptions were
tested using log-negative-log plots of the within-group survivorship
probabilities versus log time.
All analyses were performed in SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC).
