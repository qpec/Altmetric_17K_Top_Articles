IMPORTANCE TheOpen-LabelStudyofLong-termEvaluationAgainstLDL-C(OSLER-1)evaluated
the durability of long-term efficacy and safety during long-term therapy with evolocumab, a
monoclonal antibody against proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9).
OBJECTIVE To determine whether LDL-C level reductions with evolocumab persist across
different populations. Secondary objectives included assessment of adverse events, antidrug
antibodies, and factors contributing to treatment discontinuation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This ongoing, randomized open-label extension trial
(OSLER-1) was conducted at 192 sites in 18 countries. A total of 1324 of 1666 patients
randomized into 1 of 5 12-week double-blind phase 2 parent studies completed a parent study
and chose to participate in OSLER-1; 1255 received 1 or more evolocumab doses. As of August
2016, 812 of 1324 (61%) had 208 weeks of follow-up. This current study was conducted from
October 2011 to August 2016, with a data cutoff of August 26, 2016.
INTERVENTIONS During year 1, patients were randomized to evolocumab, 420 mg, plus
standard of care (SOC) or SOC alone. After year 1, all patients continuing the study received
evolocumab, 420 mg, plus SOC.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Lipids, safety, and tolerability every 12 weeks.
A multivariate model identified factors associated with discontinuation of evolocumab.
RESULTS Atparentstudybaseline,themean(SD)ageofthepopulationwas57.1(11.6)years,with
52.9% being women. The median LDL-C level was 133 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter,
multiply by 0.0259). After 52 weeks, evolocumab plus SOC was associated with a significant
reductioninLDL-Clevelby61%(95%CI,−63%to−60%)vs2%(95%CI,−5%to−0.2%)withSOC
alone (P < .001). At approximately 2, 3, and 4 years of study follow-up, the median LDL-C level
wasreducedby59%(95%CI,−60%to−57%),59%(95%CI,−61%to−58%),and57%(95%CI,
−59% to −55%), respectively, from parent study baseline. For patients receiving statin therapy
unchangedfrombaseline,atweek208,themedianLDL-Clevelreductionwas58%.Noneutralizing
antibodies to evolocumab were detected. The annualized incidence of new-onset diabetes was
4% in the SOC alone group and, adjusting for duration of evolocumab exposure, 2.8% in the
evolocumab plus SOC group. Neurocognitive event rates were 0% (SOC alone) and 0.4%
(evolocumab plus SOC). A total of 79% of patients persisted with evolocumab treatment, with a
mean exposure duration of 44 months.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In the longest clinical trial exposure to a PCSK9 inhibitor to date,
evolocumab produced sustained reductions in LDL-C levels. The annual frequency of adverse
events did not occur more frequently with cumulative exposure during open-label observation.

 L
ipid-lowering therapy has served as a cornerstone of the
cardiovascular risk factor modification strategy that has
led to improved outcomes over the past 3 decades.1 Al-
though many studies have shown substantial benefits and an
excellent overall safety profile of statins, the risk for cardio-
vascular complications in certain statin-treated populations
remainshigh.2Further,manypatientsdonotusestatinsasrec-
ommended owing to adverse effects or the perception of poor
tolerance of the drug class.3,4
In recent years, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin
type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition has emerged as a promising
approach for treating hypercholesterolemia.5 A novel strat-
egy to inhibit PCSK9 involves therapeutic monoclonal anti-
bodies that bind irreversibly to the molecule and prevent it
from binding to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor/
LDL cholesterol (C) complex. Two monoclonal antibodies
targeting PCSK9, evolocumab and alirocumab, have received
regulatory approval for treating hypercholesterolemia in
patients with cardiovascular disease or heterozygous famil-
ial hypercholesterolemia (with evolocumab also approved
for use in patients with homozygous familial hypercholester-
olemia) with inadequate LDL-C level control on maximally
tolerated statin therapy.6-9 Both drugs demonstrated signifi-
cant reductions of LDL-C and other proatherosclerotic lipo-
protein levels.10-12 A third anti-PCSK9 antibody, bococi-
zumab, demonstrated significant reductions in LDL-C levels
in phase 2 trials.13 However, a recent announcement of the
decision to discontinue development of bococizumab cited
“an unanticipated attenuation of LDL-C lowering over time,
as well as a higher level of immunogenicity and higher rate
of injection-site reactions.”14 To our knowledge, no studies
to date have demonstrated the long-term efficacy of a PCSK9
inhibitor beyond 24 months.13,15,16

Methods
Study Design and Patients
A previous report detailed the design and first-year safety and
efficacy results of the Open-Label Study of Long-term Evalua-
tion Against LDL-C (OSLER-1) from a cohort that included pa-
tients enrolled from 4 of the 5 phase 2 parent studies evalu-
ated in the current analysis.15 In total, 192 sites in 18 countries
enrolled eligible patients who completed 1 of the 5 phase 2
studies with evolocumab between October 2011 and Decem-
ber2013.17-21PatientscouldenrollinOSLER-1providedthatthey
did not discontinue treatment owing to a serious adverse event
(SAE) during their phase 2 study duration or require unblinded
lipid measurements and/or adjustment of background lipid
therapy during the first 12 weeks of OSLER-1. The first patient
consented for OSLER-1 in October 2011. The last patient en-
rolled in June 2013. The current analysis reports data from first
enrollmenttoAugust26,2016,inthisongoingclinicaltrial.The
mean (SD) age of the population was 57.1 (11.6) years.
Randomization of eligible patients occurred at or within
3 days of the phase 2 parent end-of-study visit. Patients were
randomized 2:1 to 1 of 2 treatment groups, irrespective of their
treatment assignments during the phase 2 parent study: evo-
locumab, 420 mg, subcutaneously monthly plus standard of
care (SOC) (evolocumab plus SOC) or SOC alone. At random-
ization, and for 12 weeks thereafter, central laboratories lipid
results were blinded to investigators. After 12 weeks, investi-
gators received unblinded laboratory results and could
adjust SOC therapies in either arm at their discretion. Local
investigators determined SOC therapy.
Previous reports described the schedule of events for the
first 52 weeks of the study.15 After the SOC-controlled period
of OSLER-1, all patients who had been initially randomized to
SOC alone and completed the first year could receive evo-
locumab. Thereafter, scheduled study visits occurred at
12-week intervals.
An independent ethics committee or institutional review
board approved the protocol prior to study procedures at all
sites. All patients provided written informed consent before
enrollmentintheextensionstudy.Patientsself-identifiedtheir
race and ethnicity.
Efficacy and Safety End Points
The primary objective was to characterize the effects of long-
term administration of evolocumab as assessed by changes in
LDL-C level, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non–
HDL-C) level, apolipoprotein B, total cholesterol to HDL-C
ratio, lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]), and apolipoprotein B to apolipo-
protein A-1 ratio.
Safety end points included the incidence of AEs, SAEs, and
AEs leading to discontinuation of evolocumab; the incidence
of creatine kinase and liver function test result abnormali-
ties; and the incidence of patients who developed anti-
evolocumab antibodies (binding or neutralizing). Events of
interest included new-onset diabetes, injection-site reac-
tions, neurocognitive events, and adjudicated cardiovascu-
lar events, all analyzed by exposure-adjusted year event rate
Key Points
Questions Do the lipid-lowering effects of evolocumab, a
proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor, persist with
long-term use?
Findings In this open-label extension of a randomized clinical trial,
evolocumab added to standard of care helped control low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels consistently over time, with
a median LDL-C level reduction of 57% and achieved LDL-C level of
60 mg/dL for participants with 4 years of follow-up. No significant
safety signals of concern and no neutralizing antibodies were
observed with cumulative drug exposure.
Meaning Hypercholesterolemia therapy with a proprotein
convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor reduced LDL-C levels
over an extended period, with no significant loss in efficacy or
increasing annual rate of adverse effects from cumulative
exposure.

 to evaluate a possible time-dependent relationship between
evolocumab exposure and the event.
Anindependentclinicaleventscommitteeadjudicatedcar-
diovascular events for exploratory analysis. An independent
data monitoring committee regularly reviewed data from all
ongoing randomized evolocumab studies, prepared by an ex-
ternal biostatistical group. Amgen assumed safety monitor-
ing for open-label evolocumab studies as of March 2015 at the
request of the data monitoring committee.
Laboratory Methods
Details on laboratory methods have been previously
described.15
Statistical Analysis
For efficacy end points, data were summarized for patients by
therandomizedtreatmentgroup.Safetydataanalysesusedde-
scriptive statistics. Adverse events were coded using the Medi-
cal Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 19.0. Adverse
event rates were summarized for all AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to
evolocumab discontinuation, and AEs of special interest. Ad-
verse events were reported by preferred term and tabulated
for the SOC alone group for the first year and by year of evo-
locumab exposure to evaluate a possible time-dependent re-
lationship between evolocumab exposure and AE. Exposure-
adjusted rates for AEs of special interest during evolocumab
treatment were calculated using the total number of reported
AEsdividedbycumulativetimeofevolocumabexposure.Sum-
mary statistics for continuous variables included the number
of patients, mean, median, SD or SE, 25th percentile (Q1), 75th
percentile(Q3),minimum,andmaximum.Forcategoricalvari-
ables, the frequency and percentages were presented. All data
analyses used observed values.
To best estimate the central tendency, we present mean
values for normally distributed variables and median values
for variables not normally distributed. The LDL-C values and
percentage change from baseline at each visit were not nor-
mally distributed (P < .001 from the Shapiro-Wilk test), and a
nonparametric analysis of Wilcoxon signed-rank test was
used for the comparison of percentage change from baseline
at week 52 between the evolocumab plus SOC group and
SOC alone group.
Analysisofevolocumabdiscontinuationwasperformedby
using Cox proportional hazards regression models. At the
time of this analysis, of 1255 patients who received at least 1
dose of evolocumab, 268 patients (21%) discontinued evo-
locumab. Factors including age, sex, diabetes status, coro-
nary artery disease, and high cardiovascular risk as defined by
European Society of Cardiology and National Cholesterol Edu-
cation Program scoring criteria, baseline statin intensity, and
baseline lipid panel parameters including LDL-C, total choles-
terol, triglycerides, and Lp(a) values, were tested separately
in univariate Cox models and then in a multivariate stepwise
selectionprocedure.Allstatisticaltestswerebasedona2-sided
.05 significance level without multiplicity adjustment. All sta-
tistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS
Institute). Statisticians employed by the sponsor performed
data analyses at the direction of the independent investiga-
tors who had access to the data analyses generated and could
ask for queries of the database as desired.
Results
Patients
OSLER-1enrolled1324ofthe1650eligiblepatients(80.2%)who
completed a parent study without having experienced an SAE.
Of those enrolled in OSLER-1, 882 patients were randomized

shows a CONSORT diagram of the parent studies, enrollment
into OSLER-1, and follow-up by year of evolocumab expo-
sure. Table 1 provides summary demographic characteristics
for the study population.
Of the 1255 patients who received at least 1 dose of evo-
locumab, 886 patients were taking statins at the time of re-
ceiving their first open-label dose of evolocumab. The 369
patients (29%) not taking background statin therapy reflect
those phase 2 patients with statin intolerance or taking evo-
locumabmonotherapy.Ofthosetakingstatins,249(28%)were
takinghigh-intensity,418(47%)takingmoderate-intensity,and
219 (25%) taking low-intensity statin treatment. During
follow-up, of 1255 patients who received at least 1 dose of evo-
locumab, 157 patients (13%) decreased statin intensity, includ-
ing115patients(9%)whostoppedthem;48patients(4%)either
started (22 [2%]) or increased (26 [2%]) statin intensity. All pa-
tients taking ezetimibe at the beginning of the study (171 [14%])
continued taking ezetimibe through the end of their study par-
ticipation or the data cutoff date. Nine patients (0.7%) added
ezetimibe to their treatment during the course of the study
(eTable 1 in the Supplement details background lipid therapy).
Lipid Efficacy Outcomes
As of August 2016, lipid level measurements were available for
1215 patients (92%), 1122 (85%), 1057 (80%), and 812 (61%) at
1, 2, 3, and 4 years of follow-up, respectively. The median base-
line LDL-C level at the time of parent study enrollment was
133.0 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by
0.0259). Following randomization, evolocumab lowered lipid
levels significantly within 12 weeks for patients previously as-
signed to placebo in parent studies. In patients randomized to
SOC alone in OSLER-1 who previously received evolocumab in
parent studies, LDL-C levels returned to near baseline, with-
out a rebound effect. Patients who did not change their evo-
locumab assignment during the transition from parent stud-
ies to OSLER-1 experienced no net changes in lipid levels over
the first year of observation. Although baseline levels of LDL-C
varied among patients enrolled from the 5 parent studies—

 treatment did not vary significantly by parent study (59% and
58% at week 208 for LAPLACE-TIMI 57 and GAUSS, respec-
tively). Figure 2 shows the effects of evolocumab on LDL-C
level over time.
After 52 weeks of open-label therapy, median LDL-C lev-
els in patients assigned to evolocumab plus SOC were re-
duced by 61% (95% CI, −63% to −60%) from baseline com-
pared with 2% (95% CI, −5% to −0.2%) for those assigned to
SOC alone. Median LDL-C levels in the evolocumab plus SOC
vs SOC alone groups were 53 mg/dL vs 133 mg/dL (P < .001).
Evolocumab similarly reduced lipids in this cohort of newly
treated patients to levels nearly equal to those of patients pre-
viously dosed with evolocumab (median LDL-C levels were
58 mg/dL and 54 mg/dL at week 64, respectively). At weeks
100, 160, and 208 of OSLER-1 follow-up, the median absolute
LDL-C level reductions across the cohort compared with base-
line in the parent studies were 76.5, 78.5, and 75 mg/dL and
median LDL-C levels were 57, 55, and 60 mg/dL, respectively.
At weeks 64, 100, 160, and 208 of OSLER-1 follow-up, the me-
dian percentage reductions in LDL-C level across the cohort
(including patients who were randomized to SOC alone and
started evolocumab at week 52) compared with baseline in the
parent studies were 60% (95% CI, −61% to −59%), 59% (95%
CI,−60%to−57%),59%(95%CI,−61%to−58%),and57%(95%
CI, −59% to −55%). For the 745 patients who remained receiv-
ing unchanged background statin therapy at week 208, the

 median LDL-C level reduction was 58%. At weeks 64, 100, 160,
and 208 of OSLER-1 follow-up, the median percentage reduc-
tions in Lp(a) across the cohort compared with baseline in the
parent studies were 32%, 29%, 30%, and 31% (eTable 2 in the
Supplement details other lipid parameters).
Safety and Tolerability
Table 2 summarizes AEs that occurred by year of evolocumab
exposure. During year 1 of evolocumab exposure, AEs oc-
curred in 79.3% of patients taking evolocumab plus SOC
compared with 74% of patients taking SOC alone during the
52-week SOC-controlled period. Serious AE rates were simi-
lar in the evolocumab plus SOC and SOC alone arms (6.9% vs
6.8%). The annualized AE rates in the evolocumab plus SOC
group vs SOC alone were 2.8% vs 4.0% for new-onset diabe-
tes, 0.4% vs 0% for neurocognitive events, and 4.7% vs 8.5%
for muscle-related events. The rate of new reports of muscle-
related AEs decreased in number as the years of drug expo-
sure increased, a trend also noted for injection-site reactions
andneurocognitiveevents.Meanbodymassindexandchanges
in fasting glucose between baseline and week 52 did not sig-
nificantly differ in the SOC or evolocumab plus SOC arms.
Antidrugantibodies(ADAs)occurredinfrequently.Fourpa-
tients tested positive for binding ADAs during OSLER-1 follow-
up: (1) at week 4 while taking SOC for a patient who received
evolocumab, 70 mg, once every 2 weeks during the parent
study, which resolved at week 12 and thereafter; (2) at week 4
while receiving SOC for a patient who received evolocumab,
420 mg, monthly during the parent study, which resolved at
week 12 and thereafter; (3) at weeks 4, 12, and 48 while taking
evolocumab during OSLER-1 for a patient who received pla-
cebo during the parent study, which resolved at week 52 and
thereafter; and (4) at day 1 of OSLER-1, which resolved at week
4 and thereafter for a patient who received placebo during the
parent study. No neutralizing antibodies were detected.
Table 3 shows the summary for the analysis of persis-
tence with evolocumab therapy. Of predefined baseline fac-
tors, patients with higher cardiovascular risk defined by
European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis
Societyriskcategories22takingbaselinestatinsandwithhigher
baseline LDL-C levels were more likely to continue to take
evolocumab during open-label therapy. Patients who experi-
enced AEs did not drop out at a higher rate than those who
reported no AEs.
Adjudicated cardiovascular events occurred in 11 of 442
patients (2.5%) in the SOC arm during the SOC-controlled
period as compared with 10 of 1255 (0.8%) during the first year
of evolocumab exposure. Cardiovascular event rates during
extended exposure to evolocumab remained low, with an in-
cidence of cardiovascular events during years 2, 3, and 4 of
evolocumab exposure of 1.2%, 1.2%, and 0.9%, respectively.
Discussion
OSLER-1, an open-label randomized trial followed by a long-
term observational extension, provides valuable information
about treating patients with hypercholesterolemia with a
monoclonal antibody directed against PCSK9. In this analy-
sis, we report data from 1255 patients exposed to evo-

 locumab for 44 months on average. To our knowledge, these
4641 patient-years of follow-up represent the longest and most
extensive experience reported to date for evolocumab or any
other PCSK9 inhibitor. Among members of the cohort who
reached 4 years, the efficacy of evolocumab persisted, with an
overall median LDL-C level reduction of 57% to 60 mg/dL. In
patients receiving statin coadministration at baseline and at
208 weeks, evolocumab lowered LDL-C level by 58% from
baseline. The median Lp(a) level was persistently reduced by
31%. These data suggest that evolocumab can help many pa-
tients who need additional lipid lowering beyond their
existing therapy.
Consensus opinion supports aggressive lipid-lowering
therapyforpatientsathighriskforcardiovasculardiseasecom-
plications. Used with statins, PCSK9 antibodies reduce LDL-C
tolevelsnotpreviouslyachievableinroutineclinicalpractice.23
As clinical outcomes results from large randomized blinded
studies become available, the role of PCSK9 therapy as a part
of the therapeutic armamentarium for hypercholesterolemia
will emerge. OSLER-1 adds to this assessment by demonstrat-
ing, over a longer term, the persistence of atherogenic lipo-
protein lowering and the absence of ADAs or a worsening
AE profile.
Despite inherent limitations, long-term open-label trials
can add important information relevant to clinical decision
making for chronically administered therapies such as agents
for hypercholesterolemia. Open-label extension trials usu-
ally do not provide comparative data between 2 or more treat-
ment arms and can lead to biases related to knowledge of the
therapy. Nonetheless, these trials can provide information on
the long-term efficacy and tolerance of a therapy. In open-
label trials, knowledge of the therapy received allows pa-
tients and their clinicians to mimic the decision-making
patterns of clinical practice by choosing to continue a therapy,
or not, based on their perception of whether the benefits of
treatment outweigh any AEs or inconvenience at any given

 time. This dynamic differs from that of double-blind studies
in which clinicians and many patients understand that the sci-
entific validity of comparisons requires persistence on an un-
known therapy. Further, long-term open-label trials that fol-
low shorter-term randomized, double-blind studies provide
an opportunity to analyze possible AEs that may derive from
longer-term exposure to a medical therapy.
The evolocumab persistence rate of 79% during an aver-
age of 44 months of drug exposure in OSLER-1 compares
favorably with published data for adherence to other thera-
pies including statins. For mipomersen, an approved inject-
able treatment for severe forms of hypercholesterolemia,
Santos and colleagues24 reported that 64 of 141 patients
(45.4%) with familial hypercholesterolemia continued open-
label therapy in a 2-year clinical trial. Monitoring clinical
practice, Perreault et al25 reported an overall persistence rate
for statin use in a middle-aged hypercholesterolemic popula-
tion of 71% after 6 months and 45% after 3 years. Corre-
sponding persistence rates for primary prevention patients
in this cohort were 65% and 35%, respectively. Compared
either with the investigational drug setting or clinical prac-
tice, the high persistence rates of OSLER-1 over a longer
period indicate the tolerability of evolocumab. Further,
lower dropout rates occurred among patients at higher car-
diovascular risk, demonstrating a reassuring selection pro-
cess toward patients who may benefit most from a novel
lipid-lowering therapy.
Any parenterally administered protein-based therapeu-
tic can elicit an immune response during chronic use.
Because therapeutic antibodies for hypercholesterolemia
require chronic administration, the risk for ADA develop-
ment requires evaluation. The incidence of ADAs in OSLER-1
was low: only 4 transient events were observed during the
course of the study and no neutralizing antibodies were
detected. Of these events, 1 patient tested ADA positive, who
received placebo during a parent study, on OSLER day 1. This
finding distinguishes evolocumab, a fully human antibody,
from bococizumab, an antibody with murine elements, pre-
viously shown to cause a 7% incidence of the development
of ADAs over 24 weeks.13 Although the development of
ADAs during treatment does not necessarily lead to losses of
LDL-C level lowering efficacy, at least 1 bococizumab-treated
patient demonstrated this effect over short-term drug
exposure.13
Limitations
The open-label design of OSLER-1 serves as an important limi-
tationtothestudy’
sfindings.Inparticular,16patientswhodis-
continued study participation owing to AEs in parent trials
could not enroll in OSLER-1. This protocol design feature pos-
sibly introduces a selection bias. The ongoing placebo-
controlledFOURIERstudy(NCT01764633)willprovideamuch
more detailed and comprehensive analysis of the safety and
risk reduction of evolocumab over a somewhat shorter time
frame than OSLER-1. A prospective evaluation of neurocogni-
tive function in a subset of the FOURIER population is being
assessed in the EBBINGHAUS Study.26 Nonetheless, the find-
ing of a lower adjudicated cardiovascular event rate in the evo-
locumab plus SOC arm of OSLER-1 compared with SOC alone
in the first year with continued yearly event rates during evo-
locumab exposure of less than half of that of the SOC year pro-
vides reassurance. Further, subject to the limitations of ob-
servational studies, general AEs and AEs of special interest did
not increase in incidence during continued exposure to
evolocumab of up to 4 years.
Conclusions
OSLER-1 demonstrated the persistent effectiveness of evo-
locumab for lowering LDL-C levels over an average of 44
months of exposure in a diverse patient population with
