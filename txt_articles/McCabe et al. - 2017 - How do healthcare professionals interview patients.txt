Abstract
Background: There is little evidence on how professionals communicate to assess suicide risk. This study analysed
how professionals interview patients about suicidal ideation in clinical practice.
Methods: Three hundred nineteen video-recorded outpatient visits in U.K. secondary mental health care were
screened. 83 exchanges about suicidal ideation were identified in 77 visits. A convenience sample of 6 cases in 46
primary care visits was also analysed. Depressive symptoms were assessed. Questions and responses were
qualitatively analysed using conversation analysis. χ2 tested whether questions were influenced by severity of
depression or influenced patients’ responses.
Results: A gateway closed question was always asked inviting a yes/no response. 75% of questions were negatively
phrased, communicating an expectation of no suicidal ideation, e.g., “No thoughts of harming yourself?”. 25% were
positively phrased, communicating an expectation of suicidal ideation, e.g., “Do you feel life is not worth living?”.
Comparing these two question types, patients were significantly more likely to say they were not suicidal when the
question was negatively phrased but were not more likely to say they were suicidal when positively phrased (χ2 = 7.2,
df = 1, p = 0.016). 25% patients responded with a narrative rather than a yes/no, conveying ambivalence. Here,
psychiatrists tended to pursue a yes/no response. When the patient responded no to the gateway question, the
psychiatrist moved on to the next topic. A similar pattern was identified in primary care.
Conclusions: Psychiatrists tend to ask patients to confirm they are not suicidal using negative questions. Negatively
phrased questions bias patients’ responses towards reporting no suicidal ideation.

Background
Almost one million people die by suicide every year
worldwide, equating to one suicide every 40 s [1]. Suicide
risk screening and appropriate intervention is clinically
important in both secondary and primary care. Around
one in four people who take their life have been in contact
with mental health services the year before death in the
U.K. [2] and around one in three in the U.S. [3]. The ma-
jority of depressive disorders are diagnosed and treated in
primary care [4–6]: 45% of people who took their life had
been seen in primary care the month before death in the
U.K. [7] with a similar figure of 47% in the U.S. [3]
Communicating about suicidal ideation is a delicate ac-
tivity for both clinicians and patients. Omerov et al. [8]
note a widely-held belief among professionals that enquir-
ing about suicidal ideation can increase suicidal tendencies.
Cole-King and Lepping note that professionals in the U.K.
may feel disinclined to enquire too deeply because of lack
of confidence in knowing how to ask and how to respond
[9]. From the patient’s perspective, communicating about
suicidal thoughts and plans is complex. Patients may dis-
close suicidal thoughts, be ambivalent and not fully disclose
them or may have made up their mind to attempt suicide
and make every attempt to conceal this [10]. Moreover, sui-
cidal thoughts are dynamic and can change rapidly [11].
People with experience of suicidal thoughts and attempts
report that willingness to disclose distressing thoughts and
plans is dependent on trust and the relationship [12, 13].
Silverman and Berman [14] suggest that assessing sui-
cidal risk in clinical practice is influenced by the skills and
philosophy of the individual clinician. Nonetheless, there

 are various guidelines on what to assess including life his-
tory, previous suicidal attempts and mental state [15–17],
`along with helpful frameworks for how to assess risk [12,
18, 19]. There is considerably less guidance, however, on
how to interview patients about suicidal ideation. This is
important because how doctors and other professionals ask
questions, i.e., the words and phrasing that they use, influ-
ences the patient’s response [20]. Some guidance recom-
mends asking neutral or non-leading questions [21] and/or
direct questions (e.g., “Have you had any thoughts about
killing yourself?) [22].
A growing body of research on medical interaction has
found that yes/no questions are prevalent in medical inter-
action and communicate an expectation in favour of either
‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses through their grammatical structure
and specific words that favour ‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses [23],
e.g., “Are you feeling low?” is framed positively, inviting
agreement to “feeling low” [24, 25]. Conversely, “Not feel-
ing low?” is negatively framed inviting agreement to “not
feeling low”. Specific words with positive or negative polar-
ity further reinforce bias in medical questions [26]. Words
such as ‘any’
, ‘ever’
, ‘at all’ reinforce negative bias (e.g., “Any
negative thoughts?”) while words such as ‘some’ reinforce
positive bias (e.g., “Do you have some pain here?”) [26].
However, there are no observational studies of how pa-
tients are interviewed about suicidal ideation in practice.
Hence, this study aimed to analyse how psychiatrists ask
questions about suicidal ideation and how patients re-
spond in community mental health care. A small conveni-
ence sample in primary care was also analysed.
Methods
This was a mixed methods study, involving qualitative
and quantitative analyses.
Data collection
Three hundred nineteen psychiatrist-patient appointments
in outpatient psychiatric clinics in urban, semi-rural and
rural areas in the U.K. were audio-visually recorded. Psy-
chiatrists and their patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for
schizophrenia/schizoaffective
disorder/major
depressive
disorder were asked to participate. Consecutively attend-
ing patients were approached by a researcher from June
2001-June 2002, March 2006-January 2008 and September
2011-October 2012. Participants were informed that the
study was focusing on psychiatrist-patient communica-
tion. The patient consent rate was 45.5%.
Patients’ symptoms were assessed. Patients with schizo-
phrenia were assessed by researchers not involved in treat-
ment and unaware of the content of the consultation, using
the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) [27].
Inter-rater-reliability was good (Cohen’s kappa = 0.75). Pa-
tients with depression self-rated symptoms on the Beck De-
pression Inventory (BDI) [28].
Based on symptom ratings, patients were categorised
as experiencing more or less suicidal ideation. More sui-
cidal ideation was: endorsing item 9 on the BDI
(thoughts of killing oneself) (patients with depression)
or ≥5 (maximum score 7) on the PANSS depression
item
incorporating
suicidal
ideation
(patients
with
schizophrenia). Less suicidal ideation was: 0 on the BDI
item or <5 on the PANSS item.
In primary care, a convenience sample of 46 visits for
early management of depression (≤4 weeks after diagnosis)
from two practices was screened (for full details of data col-
lection, see Karasz et al. [29]. Depression visits were identi-
fied by a Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score ≥8
or GP diagnosis of depression. The consent rate was 48.5%.
Data analysis
Qualitative conversation analysis
The recordings and transcripts were examined by RM, IH
and RB to identify talk about suicidal feelings and thoughts.
The focus on suicidal ideation was motivated by the data
because questions about suicidal behaviour were almost al-
ways preceded by questions about suicidal ideation. Typic-
ally, it was the case that only if the patient confirmed
suicidal
ideation,
questions
about
suicidal
behaviour
followed. Psychiatrist/GP questions and patient responses
about suicidal ideation were transcribed in detail using
standardized conversation analytic methods to analyse the
content of speech and speech delivery characteristics, such
as pauses, overlap, stress, intonation, and pace [30].
Each question was analysed in terms of whether it was
(1) open or closed and (2) negatively or positively
framed. The response to each question was analysed.
The psychiatric and primary care sample were analysed
separately. Some patients volunteered information about
feeling suicidal but no follow-up questions were asked.
This occurred in 2.5% of visits.
Quantitative analyses
As previous work by Heritage et al. [31] has shown that
doctors’ questions bias patients’ responses, the following
hypothesis was tested: a negatively designed question is
more likely to lead to a negative response. χ2 was also used
to explore whether patients with higher suicidal ideation
were more likely to be asked a positively framed than a
negatively framed question. Quantitative analyses were con-
ducted on the psychiatric and primary care sample together.
Results
Three hundred nineteen visits were screened. Suicidal
ideation was assessed on 83 occasions by 35 psychiatrists
in 77 visits (i.e., with 77 patients). In six visits, suicidal
ideation was assessed twice. The number of patients per
psychiatrist was 1-8. 70 (90.9%) patients had a diagnosis
of schizophrenia and 7 (9.1%) had a diagnosis of

 depression. 61.4% were male. The mean patient age was
43.5 (SD 11.2, range 19-67). On the BDI or PANSS
(available for 66 patients), 75.8% patients experienced
less and 24.2% experienced more suicidal ideation.
In primary care, suicidal ideation was assessed on 6
occasions in 5 visits (i.e., with 5 patients). In one visit, it
was assessed twice. The mean patient age was 41 (SD
8.6, range 28-55). Four patients were male. The mean
HADS score, available for 4 patients, was 15.3 (SD 3.2,
range 13-21), indicating severe depression (Fig. 1).
There were three main findings.
Psychiatrists tend to ask patients to confirm they are not
suicidal
Psychiatrists initiated enquiries about suicide risk with a
‘gateway’ question. The response to this question deter-
mined further enquiry about risk or not. In all cases, this
was a closed yes/no question. Closed questions can be an-
swered with either a single word (yes or no) or a short
phrase and are used to restrict the type of information re-
ceived [31, 32]. For example, a typical question was “Do
you ever feel that life is not worth living?” which invites a
yes or a no response.
Of 83 questions, 62 (75%) communicated an expectation
in favour of a no response and 21 (25%) communicated an
expectation in favour of a yes response. In extract 1 below,
the psychiatrist asks a preparatory question (line 1) “Not
feeling low?”, a negative declarative statement, favouring a
no response. The extracts below are conversation analytic
transcripts. The transcription symbols are presented in
Additional file 1. For reference, basic transcripts are pre-
sented in Table 1.
In response to the question “Not feeling low?” the pa-
tient responds with a narrative conveying that she does
feel low. The psychiatrist asks the gateway question as a
negative declarative statement favouring a no response:
“You don’t have thoughts of harming yourself?” (line 8).
The patient responds with a ‘no’ (line 9).

 By contrast, in extract 2, the, the gateway question
(line 8) “I mean do you become suicidal” is positively
framed with no negative polarity items. The patient re-
sponds “yes” without delay, which is qualified with
“sometimes yes”.
In extract 3, the gateway question (line 4) is prefaced
by a normalizing statement about when things are
stressful. The question “Any thoughts of harming your-
self” is negatively framed with the negative polarity item
‘any’. Note that this is not as strongly negatively framed
as the negative declarative statement in extract 1.
The patient responds without delay with ‘no’ (line 5).
The psychiatrist adds a second part to the question (line
6) “Or anybody else for that matter”. After a 0.8 s pause,
the patient responds quietly with “No” (line 8). There is a
checking “No?” (line 10) from the psychiatrist, followed by
“okay”, displaying preparedness to move on to a new topic
[33]. The risk assessment is complete and the talk moves on.
Doctors were not more likely to ask patients reporting
more suicidal ideation a positively phrased than a nega-
tively phrased question (χ2 = 1.7, df = 1, p = 0.23).
Of the 6 primary care cases (see Table 2), 2 questions in-
vited the patient to confirm that life was worth living. A
further 2 questions were negatively framed communicat-
ing an expectation of no suicidal thoughts. The final 2
questions were positively framed communicating an
expectation of suicidal thoughts. Hence, 4 of the 6 ques-
tions in primary care communicated an expectation of no
suicidal ideation.

 How doctors used negatively and positively framed
questions was examined (Fig. 2). Over half of the doctors
(i.e., 24) always used negative framing while almost one-
fifth (i.e., 7) always used positive framing.
Patients were significantly more likely to say they were
not suicidal when the question was negatively phrased
When a doctor asks a patient a closed yes/no question, they
place constraints on the kind of answer that should be pro-
vided, i.e., a yes or no [34]. As can be seen in Fig. 3, there
were 62 negatively framed questions, which received 41
(66%) no responses, 6 (9.7%) yes responses and 15 (24.2%)
narrative responses. Meanwhile, there were 21 positively
framed questions, which received 9 (42.9%) no responses, 8
(38.1%) yes responses and 4 (19%) narrative responses.
When the question was negatively framed, patients
were significantly more likely to say they were not sui-
cidal but when the question was positively framed,
patients were not more likely to say they were suicidal
(χ2 = 6.5, df = 1, p = 0.013).
The patient’s response to the gateway question was critical
as it determined whether psychiatrists conducted further risk
assessment. If patients responded no (in 60% cases), the talk
moved on to other topics (e.g., extracts 3 and 6). If the pa-
tient responded yes, this led to detailed risk assessment.
Patient narrative responses were pursued with closed
yes/no questions
Yes/no questions invite brief responses. A yes or no re-
sponse satisfies these constraints. However, a narrative re-
sponse does not [32]. Patients responded with a narrative
in around one-quarter of cases (19/83) indicating that the
yes/no choice offered by the question was problematic. This
is problematic for psychiatrists because it does not define
risk in a clear-cut way. Hence, psychiatrists pursued a yes/
no response following an initial narrative response.
Table 2 Six extracts from primary care
McCabe et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2017) 17:122 
Page 5 of 10
 In extract 4a, the psychiatrist poses a negatively framed
question with the negative polarity item ‘ever’ (lines 1-2):
“do you ever feel yourself that life isn’t worth living”. Fol-
lowing a micro-pause of less than 0.2 s, the psychiatrist
reformulates the question (4-5), from “you can’t go on any-
more” replacing it with a more specific description “life
isn’t worth living”. The patient is crying and responds (6-7)
with “at the moment I would like it all to stop sometimes
because it’s just t-“. The psychiatrist seeks to clarify this
utterance twice (9,11). The patient and psychiatrist are
competing in overlapping talk (square brackets: 15-20)
during which the psychiatrist (16) puts forward a possible
understanding as “Do you mean by turning your mind
off?”. The patient does not respond to this question and
continues recounting her difficulties (lines 18-20). This
continues for a further minute during which the patient is
crying extensively.
The psychiatrist returns to the question in extract 4b
(1-3), invoking a need to ask, thereby minimizing her
agency in asking the question: “I need to ask you-“.
Again the question is ‘no inviting’ and modified from
line 4, extract 4a. This version “do you- have you ever
thought .hhh that you don’t want to live anymore?” is
quickly reformulated to “Have you ever actually had sui-
cidal thoughts Mrs. Day?”, another ‘no inviting’ question,
upgraded from “don’t want to live anymore” to “suicidal
thoughts”. The patient responds again with a narrative
(4-5), hedging her response “I don’t really know…”.
Following two unsuccessful attempts to secure a yes/
no, the psychiatrist moves from thoughts to behaviour
and seeks confirmation that the patient has not done
something to harm herself (7-11) with another closed
negatively framed declarative question “so you’ve never
actually done something consciously or objectively to
harm yourself”. Once a ‘no’ response is secured (8,10,12),
the psychiatrist receipts with “okay” and moves on to
other symptoms. As with the question about suicidal idea-
tion, the question about suicidal behaviour is a negatively
phrased question inviting the patient to confirm that she
has not acted to harm herself.
Discussion
There were three main findings from this study. Firstly,
questions about suicidal ideation were closed yes/no
questions designed to constrain the patient’s response to
a yes/no. All were leading questions with three-quarters
inviting the patient to confirm they were not feeling
suicidal. More than half of the psychiatrists always
framed the question negatively, with a minority always
framing the question positively. Secondly, a subtle differ-
ence in the wording of the question biased the patient’s

 response.
Negatively
framed
questions
significantly
biased the patient’s response towards a no ‘suicidal idea-
tion’ response. If the patient responded yes, further in-
formation gathering was conducted. However, if the
patient responded no, the psychiatrist moved on to other
topics with no further risk assessment.
Finally, patients responded with a narrative in one-
quarter of cases. Narratives conveyed some suicidal
thoughts and were pursued with closed yes/no questions.
That questions about suicidal ideation were more
likely to be negatively framed is consistent with other re-
search on doctor questioning. Typically, doctors design
questions for the ‘best case’ patient outcome, e.g., “Not
feeling low?”, identified as the principle of optimization,
a default feature of medical questions [25]. Previous re-
search also found that doctors’ questions bias patients’
responses. In a randomised controlled trial, doctors
who asked “Do you have some other concerns you
would like to discuss?” inviting a yes, versus “Do you
have any other concerns you would like to discuss?”,
inviting a no, were significantly more likely to elicit
and reduce unmet concerns compared before and after
the visit [31].
In asking about suicidal ideation, optimized or ‘no
problem’ questions are problematic because they minim-
ise the disclosure of suicidal ideation, a tension also de-
scribed in other medical settings [35]. Gao et al. [36]
found that patients were more likely to minimize the fre-
quency and severity of suicidal ideation during clinician
ascertained assessment compared to self-report. The
current study sheds some light on these and other find-
ings from the U.K. National Confidential Inquiry into
Suicide [37] that most people who took their life were
classified as ‘low risk’ in contacts with mental health ser-
vices. In the U.S., Smith et al. [38] also found that most
patients dying by suicide “denied suicidal ideation” in
their final contact with services. Furthermore, Haynal-
Reymond et al. [39] found that psychiatrists’ written pre-
dictions predicted 22.7% of future attempts. However,
psychiatrists’ nonverbal behaviour, specifically frowning
and gazing at the patient for longer, predicted around
90% of future attempts. This suggests a perception of
risk, of which doctors are not consciously aware, that is
overridden by verbal communication.
The findings should be considered in light of the
study’s strengths and limitations. This is the first sys-
tematic analysis of how psychiatrists interview pa-
tients about suicidal ideation using real time data.
Conversation analysis shows how one word can tilt
the question positively or negatively. Although the
findings were similar over time across different psy-
chiatric samples, they may be specific to these patient
groups and settings. The data, although collected
across urban, semi-urban and rural settings, were col-
lected in the U.K and practice may vary across coun-
tries. This qualitative study did not study factors such
as diagnosis, sex and previous suicide attempts. A
gold standard assessment such as the Columbia Sui-
cide Severity Rating Scale was not used. However,
such scales are not used in routine practice. Never-
theless, psychiatrists’ choice of questioning may reflect
their intuitive assessment of risk. Finally, the consent
rate was less than 50%: patients who consented may
not be fully representative of the patient population.
There are various reasons why psychiatrists may use
negatively framed questions. They will be aware of the

 workload implications of a yes response, i.e., the need
for a more in depth assessment and potentially onward
referrals. They may also believe that more extensive as-
sessment and escalation of bureaucratic procedures is
not in the patient’s best interest. Moreover, patients and
psychiatrists may collude in not talking about suicide be-
cause it is emotionally difficult for everyone.
The findings suggest a dilemma for around one-quarter
of patients who responded with a narrative conveying am-
bivalence. If they say no, despite some suicidal thoughts
their care could be compromised. However, conveying a
clear yes could result in a less welcome response: further
intrusive questions, closer observation, a formal mental
health assessment or the possibility that their children may
be removed from their care. For patients, problems that
are difficult to put into words or of questionable legitimacy
tend to be presented in narratives [40]. For psychiatrists,
narratives are also problematic as it is more difficult to
classify risk in a categorical way.
These findings have implications for clinical practice.
Positively framed questions do not bias the patient’s re-
sponse as negatively framed questions do. As recom-
mended in U.S. [41] and U.K. [42] suicide Prevention
Strategies, professionals could benefit from training in
eliciting suicidal ideation.
Conclusions
Psychiatrists ask patients closed yes/no questions about
suicidal ideation. It is not possible to ask a non-leading,
closed question. The majority of questions communi-
cated an expectation in favour of a ‘no’ response. These
questions biased patients’ responses towards reporting
no suicidal ideation. Hence, they may not be optimal in
eliciting suicidal ideation.
