ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between institutional violence in obstetrics and 
postpartum depression (PP depression) and the potential effect of race, age, and educational 
level in this outcome. 
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study about the health care conditions for the maternal 
and child population of the Federal District, Brazil, carried out in 2011. The study has used a 
probabilistic sample of 432 women, whose children were aged up to three months, stratified by 
clusters. Indicators of institutional violence and demographic characteristics have been used in 
a logistic regression model to estimate the probability of occurrence of postpartum depression. 
RESULTS: The model has identified a high prevalence of postpartum depression, being it higher 
among non-white women and adolescent females, besides having a strong positive association 
between the several indicators of obstetric violence and postpartum depression. Positive 
interactions on a multiplicative scale have also been observed between: violence by negligence 
by health care professionals and race and age; physical violence from health care professionals 
and age; and, verbal violence from health care professionals and race. 
CONCLUSIONS: The indicators adopted to reflect institutional violence in obstetric care are 
positively associated with postpartum depression, which calls for a reflection on the need to make 
the health care protocols adequate to the precepts of the Brazilian humanization of childbirth 
care policies and changes in the obstetric care model.

INTRODUCTION
Improving maternal health was the fifth goal for the millennium as defined by the Millennium 
Summit of the United Nations, in 2000, in New York. The objective of this event was to 
evaluate the leading world problems. Among the indicators proposed to measure the quality 
of health of pregnant women were: the increase of deliveries assisted by qualified health 
care professionals and a 75% decrease of the maternal mortality ratio, taking as baseline the 
value of this indicator for 1990. Some of these indicators in Brazil are close to meeting the 
goals stipulated by the World Health Organization (WHO); however, other indicators used 
to measure the quality of care at childbirth – such as those associated with gender issues – 
have not been privileged. In addition, despite the great advance that the Brazilian Unified 
Health System (SUS) represents to the country’s health care, there are still serious problems 
related to the access to reproductive health services and to the quality of the care offered for 
childbirth20. Among the problems related to the health of pregnant women, concerns have 
been raised more recently regarding certain practices adopted in medical assistance, referred 
to by specialists as “institutional violence in childbirth” or “obstetric violence”5,7,9,10,12,13,21,24. 
According to the Brazilian Ministry of Health19, institutional violence is defined as the failure 
to act or any type of omission in health care services. This ranges from the broad level of lack 
of access to these services to their bad quality. 
Some epidemiological studies have associated the occurrence of psychiatric disorders in the 
puerperal period, among them postpartum depression, with elements related to obstetrical 
care2-4,11,16,23,27,29, such as feeling of abandonment during delivery, inadequate pain management, 
frustration for having delivered via cesarean section when natural childbirth was possible, 
and the pregnant woman’s perception of the team who provided the care. The negative 
impacts resulting from psychiatric disorders in the postpartum period are clearly harmful 
to the bonding between mother and child. 
This study aimed to investigate the association between institutional violence in obstetrics and 
postpartum depression and the potential effect of race, age, and educational level in this outcome. 
METHODS 
This study used the data from the research “Diagnosis of the health conditions and of the 
health care provided to the maternal and child population of the Federal District”, carried 
out during the national multi-vaccination campaign of 2011 in the Federal District (DF), 
Brazil, and it was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Faculdade de Ciências da 
Saúde of the Universidade de Brasília (Process 13010). 
The sampling strategy adopted was probabilistic, complex, by clusters, in two stages, and 
representative of the DF and for all administrative regions of the DF. The first stage consisted 
of choosing the health care centers, and the second stage, the mother-child pairs. The 
eligible health care centers were selected by randomization (maintaining representation 
for administrative regions). A total of 25 health care centers were selected, in 21 of the 30 
administrative regions of the DF in 2010. The second stage referred to the systematic selection 
of mother and child pairs in the vaccination queue. In order to preserve the randomization 
criteria sample, each selected health center had a determined sampling interval, according 
to the estimate of attendance based on the number of children vaccinated at that unit in 
the campaign of the previous year (interval ranging from 1: 2 to 1:10 mothers/children). 
This study used the part of the sample consisting of mothers whose children were aged up to 
three months and who answered the questions about postpartum depression; this estimate 
used a supposed prevalence of 20%. The calculated sample size was 432 women, with a 
95% confidence interval and sampling error of 5%. The inclusion criteria were: mother with 
children younger than three months of age on the vaccination day.

The expansion of the sample for the population of the DF was calculated by the sample 
weight of each individual, respecting the representativeness of each sampling unit in the 
calculation of the sample. For this estimate, the inverse of the probability for each health 
center selected was multiplied by the number of individuals who effectively took part in 
the campaign, under the total number of cases collected. After the expansion, the sample 
represented a universe of 10,468 women. 
For data collection, a previously tested form was used. Mothers were questioned about care 
for delivery, type of delivery, referral or not to a maternity hospital or need to search for a 
hospital bed, presence of a companion before, during, and immediately after childbirth, if they 
reported any violence in the relationships with health care professionals, and postpartum 
depression, besides information on family characteristics. Information about race or color 
perception was collected (initially in four categories: white, black, yellow, and indigenous) 
and aggregated into two categories (white and others – non-white). The education of the 
mother was measured asking the mother about the last completed year of education, and 
this information was aggregated into two categories of educational level: elementary or 
middle school (equal or less than 12 years) or university (more than 12 years at schooling). 
The age of the mother was calculated using the given birth date, and aggregated into two 
categories: less than 20 years old (adolescents) and 20 years old or more (adults). 
The shorter version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS-6) was adopted for 
screening of postpartum depression and it was validated by Malloy-Diniz et al.15 in 2010. The 
best cutoff point for screening of depression symptoms suggested by the authors is the score 
of ≥ 6 (81% sensibility; 86% specificity). Santos26 has compared the complete version of the 
Edinburgh scale with the shorter version and found an almost-perfect agreement between 
both scales. Postpartum depression is the dependent variable in this study. 
The conceptual model of quality of care at childbirth used to build the indicators of violence 
is based on a thesis that interactions between women, health care professionals, health 
care facilities, and society can influence the care at childbirth, and violence can be present 
in those relations25. 
To build the indicators for the analysis, “zero” meant the answer “no” and “one” meant the 
answer “yes” to these questions. The indicator for violence in the relationship between the 
parturient and the health care system – VSis – was defined by the answer yes to any of these 
questions: a) Did you go to more than one hospital to find a bed for childbirth? and b) Did 
your delivery not happen in the hospital originally recommended? The indicator to measure 
institutional violence in the relationship between the parturient and the health care services – 
VSer – was defined by the answer yes to the questions: a) Were you not allowed a companion 
of your own choice during labor?; b) during childbirth?; and, c) after childbirth? The indicator 
to measure violence in the relationship of the parturient with the health care professionals – 
VP – considered three types: those related to physical violence – VPF –, those related to verbal 
violence – VPV –, and those related to violence by negligence – VPN. Physical violence was 
defined as the answer yes to the questions: During childbirth, did any of the health care 
professionals: a) hurt you during the vaginal exam?; b) hit you?; c) push you?; and, d) tie you? 
Verbal violence was defined by the answer yes to any of the questions: During delivery, did 
any of the health professionals: a) yell at you?; or said something similar to b) Don’t cry! Next 
year you will be here again; c) When you were making the baby, you didn’t cry, or called your 
mommy. Why are you crying now?; d) If you keep screaming, I will stop what I’m doing and I 
won’t come back again; and, e) If you keep screaming, you will harm your baby. It will be born 
deaf. Violence by negligence was defined as the answer yes to the questions: a) Did the health 
care professionals deny you pain relief?; b) Did any health care professional deny assistance?; 
and, c) Did any health care professional not explain the procedures he or she was doing to 
you? These indicators are the independent variables in the study. 
The descriptive analysis for sample characterization adopted central tendency and dispersion 
and frequency measures. Bivariate analysis, by Pearson’s Chi-square test, was used to

estimate the association of postpartum depression with the categories of institutional 
violence and with the categories of demographic and socioeconomic variables. Prevalence 
of postpartum depression for each variable and its 95% confidence intervals was calculated. 
Univariate logistic regression was used to calculate the crude odds ratio. For multivariate 
analysis, a logistic regression model was built including all the variables of interest, in which 
postpartum depression is the dependent variable and the other ones related to violence 
are the independent variables. Race, color, and educational level were used as control 
confounding variables. To access interaction, the product of each two evaluated terms 
was added to the model, which were: race and VPN, race and VPF, race and VPV, age and 
VPN, age and VPF, age and VPV, schooling and VPN, schooling and VPF, and schooling and 
VPV. The modeling strategy adopted to estimate the adjusted odds ratio was the backward 
stepwise method. The model begins with all predictors included. The computer then tests 
whether any of those predictors can be removed from the model without having a substantial 
effect on how well the model fits the observed data. The criterion to include variables in the 
model was their association with the occurrence of postpartum depression – p < 0.20 in the 
bivariate analysis (Pearson) – and a theoretical relevance for the analysis. By this criterion, 
we included race, age, and educational level in the model. For the final model, we kept the 
variables that continued to present an association with the outcome when adjusted by all 
other variables (p < 0.05 in the Wald test) and those that were considered relevant by the 
literature, besides those that composed the interactions, when these were significant. 
RESULTS
The total sample, after expansion, comprised 10,468 women. The average age of women 
with children under three months of age, included in this study, was 28.8 years (14–45 years, 
SD = 7.24 years), of which 59.9% were non-white. Regarding schooling, 42.6% of the women 
had complete or incomplete university education. Table 1 describes their demographic and 
socioeconomic characteristics. 
For obstetric care, 97.8% of the respondents said they had prenatal care. For 37.1% of the women, 
the first visit was in the first month of pregnancy, and for 35.3% it was in the second month. 
The public hospitals of the DF were responsible for 49.1% of the deliveries, and the overall 
proportion of cesarean sections was 72.2%. Women classified the quality of prenatal care as 
very good (45.6%) and good (39.7%). 
Regarding the setting of delivery, 64.1% of the women were referred to hospitals during 
prenatal care, although only 53.3% of them did, in fact, have their delivery at the previously 
referred hospital. For 33.7% of them, there was no hospital referral at all. The number of 
hospitals sought for delivery was 1.57 (1–11, SD = 0.91) on average. 
For institutional routines for care during and immediately after delivery, only 55.1% of the 
women reported they had a companion of their own choice during delivery, and 25.6% 
explained they were not allowed by the services. Skin-to-skin contact between mother 
and child, or the child being breastfeed during the first hour of life, was reported by 78.7% 
of them women, whereas rooming-in was available for 91.8% of them. Only 2.6% of the 
women considered the quality of care at delivery bad or very bad; however, there were 
complaints regarding painful vaginal exams (6.9%), inadequate pain relief (6%), poor service 
(2.4%), and lack of communication and explanations of the professional as to the obstetric 
procedures being performed (3.6%). Use of offensive language by health care professionals 
during childbirth care was also reported. Table 1 also summarizes the characterization of 
the studied population according to some obstetric care variables.
The prevalence of postpartum depression in the studied population was 18.4%. This 
prevalence in women with children aged up to 3 months was higher among non-white women 
(prevalence ratio = 1.7), those who had finished middle school (prevalence ratio = 1.6), and 
 5

those who were aged under 20 years (prevalence ratio = 2.8). Table 2 describes the prevalence 
of postpartum depression with its respective confidence intervals for some selected variables.
Table 3 presents the crude odds ratio and its respective confidence intervals for the 
association between the outcome and the variables related to violence in obstetric care. All 
the selected variables, when analyzed individually, were strongly associated with a higher risk 
of postpartum depression. Women who suffered violence by negligence at childbirth had a 
seven times higher risk of developing postpartum depression than women who did not. Both 
physical and verbal violence were also strongly associated with postpartum depression (5.83 
and 5.93, respectively). It is noteworthy that the presence of a companion during delivery 
was a protective factor against postpartum depression. 
The logistic regression model described in Table 4 shows that physical violence (OR = 1.51; 
95%CI 1.1–2), in the relationship between the parturient and health care professionals, is the 
most important determinant of postpartum depression, more than the violence related to 
the health care system (OR = 0.84; 95%CI 0.7–0.9) and to the health services (OR = 1.34; 95%CI 
1.2–1.6). In addition, the model suggests that race and age are variables that modify the effect 
of all violence in the relationship with health professionals: physical, verbal, and by negligence. 
The odds ratio for the product of violence by negligence from health care professionals and 
race shows a positive interaction on a multiplicative scale, OR = 16.76 (95%CI 6.8–40.9). 
Considering the same control variables, race increases in 1.17 times the risk of developing

depression in individuals who did not suffer violence by negligence, whereas, in those who 
did suffer it, the risk of developing depression is 19.69 times higher [Exp(0.16+2.82)]. 
As for the age effect, once exposed to physical violence by a health care professional, the 
effect of younger age increased in approximately 17 times the risk of the woman developing 
depression [Exp(1.11+1.76)]. However, individuals who showed the same values for the 
control variables and who were not subjected to violence by negligence had a risk of 
developing depression three times higher than those who did suffer this type of violence. 
Moreover, younger individuals who suffered violence by negligence had a lower risk of 
developing depression, in the order of 0.3 times [Exp(1.11-2.3)]. 
There was also an interaction between verbal violence by a health care professional and race, 
being it a positive interaction on a multiplicative scale, with an OR = 3.54 (95%CI 1.9–6.6). 
Keeping the values for the control variables, the effect of race on individuals subjected to 
verbal violence increased in approximately four times the risk of postpartum depression 
[Exp(0.16+1.27)]. 
DISCUSSION 
Psychiatric disorders during the puerperal period affect a significant number of women and can 
negatively affect the health of mother and baby3,6,27,28. This study identified a high prevalence of 
postpartum depression in non-white adolescent women, besides a strong positive association 
between the several indicators of violence in obstetric care and postpartum depression. 
Some other studies have found a higher prevalence of postpartum depression, such as the 
prospective cohort study by Brito et al.6 and Ludermir et al.14 The differences observed might 
be due to study design. Moreover, selecting women who bring their children to vaccination will, 
probably, underestimate the prevalence of postpartum depression, as women with postpartum 
depression are more unlikely to bring their children to vaccination. 
Positive interactions on the multiplicative scale were observed between violence by 
negligence by a health care professional and race and age, physical violence by a health care 
professional and age, and verbal violence by a health care professional and race. 
Unfortunately, the broad spectrum of psychiatric disorders related to the puerperal period 
are poorly understood and, consequently, under-diagnosed and under-treated16. Research in 
the neurobiology area suggests that highly stressful experiences of violence and threats can 
lead to a hyper-activation and deregulation of the autonomous nervous system, translating 
stress into emotional disorders. Although postpartum depression has a multifactorial origin,

Institutional violence and depression 
Souza KJ et al.
https://doi.org/10.1590/S1518-8787.2017051006549
researchers on mental health agree that trauma is a risk factor for the development of 
depression and other psychiatric disorders3,27,29. 
Menage18, while studying the association of psychological stress caused by obstetric and 
gynecological procedures, has found a high correlation between variables related to childbirth 
care and psychiatric disorders, such as feeling of loss of control by the woman, lack of 
information given by the health care professional, experience of physical pain, perception 
of not having been adequately taken care of by the health care team, and submission to 
procedures without informed consent. In critical reviews of the literature, Olde et al.23 and 
Zambaldi et al.29 have observed that inadequate pain relief, feeling of loss of control by 
the woman, a humiliating experience, lack of information and support by the health care 
team, and fear of own or baby’s death were risk factors for the development of psychiatric 
disorders. Several studies have shown a positive association between events related to 
delivery and postpartum depression. Alvarado-Esquivel et al.2 have found odds ratio of 7.71 
for women with postpartum depression subjected to stress during delivery. A study on the 
subjective configurations of postpartum depression27 has reported that some experiences 
are associated with the onset of a postpartum depression episode, such as those related to 
the feeling of abandonment, inadequate pain control, and feeling of frustration of women 
who were subjected to a cesarean section when natural childbirth was possible. In another 
research27, 60% of the women who considered their delivery traumatic showed depression 
symptoms in the first six weeks after childbirth. The indicators used in our study to measure 
institutional violence in obstetric care strengthen these results. 
The indicator of violence related to the health care system, represented by the search 
for a hospital bed during labor, showed significant positive association with postpartum 
depression in the univariate analysis; however, it was not a risk factor for the development 
of postpartum depression when other variables were included in the model. The access to 
reproductive health care services, the search for health care assistance, and the long waits 
are characteristic of the Brazilian health care system and, because they are intrinsic to the 
culture, many times they are not considered a type of violence. Physicians, administrators, 
employees of the institutions, and the patients themselves accept that patients need to 
wait to receive assistance7,8. It contradicts the WHO recommendations and Brazilian Law 
11,634/2007 that a parturient has a guaranteed right to know in which maternity she will 
deliver. The search for care puts the mother’s and baby’s health at risk; and black, indigenous, 
and migrant women are the ones who suffer more discrimination in their access to health 
care services and who are usually the most vulnerable to this type of institutional violence. 
According to Deslandes8, these failures of the health care system are important barriers to 
the development of humanized care during childbirth and evidence the disconnection of 
the health care network for women. 
The indicator of institutional violence in health care services, after adjusted for other variables, 
was significantly associated with the outcome. Suffering violence in health care services 
increases in approximately six times the probability of women developing postpartum 
depression; the univariate analysis has already shown the protective role of the presence 
of a companion. Even though Brazilian Law 11,108, from 2005, guarantees the right of a 
companion of the woman’s own choice before, during, and immediately after delivery in the 
hospitals of the Brazilian National Unified Health System (SUS), and by-law GM 2418/2005 
guarantees this same right to women cared at private hospitals under contract with the SUS, 
this was not a reality reported by the women interviewed in our study. 
However, despite being determinant of postpartum depression in the univariate analysis, 
in the logistic regression, the violence related to the system and to health care services lost 
strength of association, evidencing the importance of violence by health professionals in the 
determination of postpartum depression. The indicators of violence in the relationship of 
the parturient with health care professionals showed the strongest positive association with 
postpartum depression. The term used to represent the interaction of the variable violence by 
negligence by a health care professional with the non-white race showed a positive coefficient,

suggesting an increase of the effect on a multiplicative scale. The increase in the probability 
of developing postpartum depression, given the interaction between these two variables, 
can still be higher than that observed in the term that represents the interaction, if the 
values of each of the variables are considered individually. According to Diniz10, unnecessary 
surgeries, loneliness, and abandonment, which are “rooted” in routine procedures, are the 
social inequalities linked to gender, class, and race that increase discrimination even more. 
For Mattar et al.17, there are reproductive hierarchies, meaning that some maternities are 
more prestigious and respected than others, whereas others can be sources of prejudice, 
discrimination, and human rights violation. 
A study done in 2008, in a large city of Brazil1 found that health care professionals recognize 
the use of discriminatory and disrespectful practices in the day-to-day care, such as pejorative 
language, threats, reprimands, and negligence in pain management. A research carried out 
in 2010, representative for Brazil in which 2,365 women from 25 states from both urban 
and rural areas were interviewed, found that one in each four women suffered some type 
of violence during delivery, especially a painful vaginal exama. Data from another research 
on institutional violence in public maternities from the city of São Paulo has shown that 
pregnant women and parturients recognize discriminatory practices and rudeness in the 
care provided by health professionals, and these experiences are frequent, thus revealing 
the trivialization of this type of violence10. 
In our study, despite the strong association observed between violence in obstetric care 
and postpartum depression, we should be careful when assuming causality based on the 
cross-sectional nature of the study, in which the outcome variable and the exposure to 
violence are investigated simultaneously. Moreover, the measure of association used, that 
is, the odds ratio, may overestimate the risk in conditions in which the prevalence of the 
outcome is higher. Other important potential limitation of the study is the absence of 
screening for depression prior to pregnancy, which, according to the consulted literature, 
is one of the main predictors of postpartum depression3. Another limitation of the study is 
the potential bias of a high educational level of the respondents – 42.6% of the women had 
been a student at some university – and it might had influenced the high number of prenatal 
care visits. As limitations of this study we can also include: non-qualification of received 
refusals and the possibility of mothers with postpartum depression not watching their 
children during the vaccination campaign, as a consequence of their depression. However, 
the prevalence of postpartum depression in this study (18.4%) is similar to that observed in 
the study “Chamada Neonatal na Amazônia Legal e Nordeste” from 2010, which was 18.0%20. 
From the results of this research, we conclude that the indicators used to reflect institutional 
violence in obstetric care were positively associated with postpartum depression in the 
Brazilian Federal District. These results indicate the need of both the adequacy of obstetric 
care protocols and the sensitizing of health professionals to the need to change their attitudes 
and practices followed by changes in the obstetric care model.
