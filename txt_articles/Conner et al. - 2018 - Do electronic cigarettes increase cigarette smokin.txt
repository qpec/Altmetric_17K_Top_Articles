background In cross-sectional surveys, increasing 
numbers of adolescents report using both electronic 
cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and cigarettes. This study 
assessed whether adolescent e-cigarette use was 
associated prospectively with initiation or escalation of 
cigarette use.
Methods Data were from 2836 adolescents (aged 
13–14 years at baseline) in 20 schools in England. At 
baseline, breath carbon monoxide levels, self-reported 
e-cigarette and cigarette use, sex, age, friends and family 
smoking, beliefs about cigarette use and percentage 
receiving free school meals (measure of socioeconomic 
status) were assessed. At 12-month follow-up, self-
reported cigarette use was assessed and validated by 
breath carbon monoxide levels.
Results At baseline, 34.2% of adolescents reported 
ever using e-cigarettes (16.0% used only e-cigarettes). 
Baseline ever use of e-cigarettes was strongly associated 
with subsequent initiation (n=1726; OR 5.38, 95% CI 
4.02 to 7.22; controlling for covariates, OR 4.06, 95% CI 
2.94 to 5.60) and escalation (n=318; OR 1.91, 95% CI 
1.14 to 3.21; controlling for covariates, this effect 
became non-significant, OR 1.39, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.82) 
of cigarette use.
Conclusions This is the first study to report prospective 
relationships between ever use of e-cigarettes and 
initiation and escalation of cigarette use among UK 
adolescents. Ever use of e-cigarettes was robustly 
associated with initiation but more modestly related to 
escalation of cigarette use. Further research with longer 
follow-up in a broader age range of adolescents is 
required.
InTRoduCTIon
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) deliver inhaled 
aerosol usually containing nicotine. E-cigarettes are 
thought to have minimal impact on morbidity and 
mortality1 2 and are recognised as harm reducing 
for adult smokers.2–4 Although rates of adolescent 
regular use of e-cigarettes are low, rates of ever 
use are substantial (13%–22%) and have increased 
over recent years, whereas rates of cigarette use 
have decreased over the same period both in the 
USA5–7 and UK.8–15 Nevertheless, the possible rela-
tionship between adolescent e-cigarette use and the 
initiation and escalation of cigarette use remains 
under-researched.
Longitudinal data on e-cigarette use and subse-
quent cigarette use are currently limited to 
US samples based on unverified self-reported 
measures.16–19 For example, two US studies reported 
baseline e-cigarette use to be positively associated 
with the initiation of cigarette use 12 months later 
in 14-year olds controlling for various predictors of 
smoking (OR 1.75, 95% 
CI 1.10 
to 2.77; OR 2.87, 
95% 
CI 2.03 
to 4.05).17 18 Barrington-Trimis et al16 
reported similar findings over 16 months in 17-year-
olds (OR 6.17, 95% 
CI 3.30 
to 11.6), whereas Wills 
et al19 reported that e-cigarette use was linked to 
initiation (OR 2.87, 95% 
CI 2.03 
to 4.05) but not to 
escalation of smoking over 12 months in a sample 
of adolescents aged 14–15 
years.
This study is novel in assessing these relationships 
between e-cigarette use and subsequent cigarette 
use in a sample of UK adolescents and in exploring 
a number of previously unexamined smoking risk 
factors as covariates and moderators. In particular, 
we investigated the extent to which baseline ever 
use of e-cigarettes was associated with the initiation 
or escalation of cigarette use (objectively validated) 
12 months later in a sample of UK adolescents aged 
13–14 
years. The impact of controlling for various 
smoking risk factors such as friends and family 
smoking and their moderating effects was also 
explored.

Participants and procedures
Data were collected as part of a 4-year cluster 
randomised controlled trial of a school-based 
smoking initiation intervention20 21 based on 
implementation intentions.22 Data from 2836 
adolescents (13–14 years at baseline) in the 20 
control schools are reported here. Head teachers 
consented to school participation with parents 
given the option to withdraw children from the 
study. Adolescents consented by completing ques-
tionnaires matched across time points using a 
personally generated code. The data reported 
here are from waves 3 (September–December 
2014; referred to as baseline) and 4 (September–
December 2015; referred to as follow-up) of the 
trial when e-cigarette use measures were added to 
the data collection.
The Faculty of Medicine, University of Leeds, 
UK, ethical review committee approved the study 
(reference 12–0155).

Measures
Cigarette use was assessed using a standardised measure23 at 
both time points; adolescents ticked one of the following: ‘I 
have never smoked; I have only tried smoking once; I used to 
smoke sometimes, but I never smoke cigarettes now; I some-
times smoke cigarettes now, but I don’t smoke as many as one 
a week; I usually smoke between one and six cigarettes a week; 
and I usually smoke more than six cigarettes a week’. Self-re-
ported smoking was validated against a measure of breath 
carbon monoxide (CO) levels (using Micro+ Smokerlyzer CO 
Monitor; Bedfont Scientific Limited, Kent, England, UK). Such 
measures are reliable and valid ways of assessing regular ciga-
rette smoking24 25 but not occasional smoking due to the short 
half-life (4–6 
hours) of breath CO.
E-cigarettes/vapourisers were described as ‘a tube that some-
times looks like a normal cigarette and has a glowing tip. They 
all puff a vapour that looks like smoke but unlike normal ciga-
rettes, they don’t burn tobacco’. Awareness (‘Have you ever 
heard of e-cigarettes or vapourisers?’ yes I have; no I haven’t; I 
don’t know) and use (‘Which ONE of the following is closest to 
describing your experience of e-cigarettes or vapourisers?’ I have 
never used them; I have tried them once or twice; I use them 
sometimes (more than once a month but less than once a week); 
I use them often (more than once a week)) of e-cigarettes were 
tapped by single items.
Other measures were assessed as covariates/moderators. 
Percentage of children at a school eligible for free school meals 
was used as an indicator of socioeconomic status.26 Sex and age 
were measured (age not used in analyses as adolescents from 
one school year). Family smoking was assessed using the ques-
tion, ‘Who smokes in your family now? Tick all the people who 
smoke at the moment’, followed by a list of family members 
(zero to nine family members marked; scored as 0, 1, 2 or 3 or 
more). Friends’ smoking was assessed using the question, ‘How 
many of your friends smoke?’ none of them; only a few; half and 
half; most but not all; all of them (scored as none of them, a few 
or most (last three categories)).
Baseline health cognitions about smoking21 were assessed as 
mean of multiple items on five-point scales (high scores indi-
cated negative views of smoking): intention was tapped by three 
statements (‘I plan not to smoke’, ‘I don’t want to smoke’ and 
‘I will try not to smoke’; strongly disagree to strongly agree; 
Cronbach’s alpha 0.90), attitude by seven statements (‘For me, 
smoking would be… good–bad; beneficial–harmful; pleasant–
unpleasant; 
enjoyable–unenjoyable; 
wise–foolish; 
fun–not 
fun; healthy–unhealthy’; Cronbach’s alpha 0.87), norms by 
five statements (‘Most of my friends think…’; ‘My best male 
friend thinks…’; ‘My best female friend thinks…’; ‘My family 
think…’; ‘People who are important to me think…’; I should 
smoke–I should not smoke; Cronbach’s alpha 0.79), perceived 
behavioural control by three statements (‘I am confident I could 
resist smoking’, strongly disagree to strongly agree; ‘For me 
to not smoke would be…’, difficult–easy; ‘How much control 
do you feel you have over not smoking?’ no control–complete 
control; Cronbach’s alpha 0.69) and self-efficacy by six state-
ments (‘I can say no to smoking, even at school’; ‘I can say no 
to smoking even when I am offered a cigarette’; ‘I can say no to 
smoking, even if my friends want me to smoke’; ‘I can say no to 
smoking, even if I was the only one in the group not smoking’; ‘I 
can say no to smoking, even if I feel a bit left out of the group’; 
‘I can say no to smoking, even if I feel like smoking’; strongly 
disagree-strongly agree; Cronbach’s alpha 0.91).

data analysis
We tested for differences on each baseline measure between 
adolescents who had complete versus missing values on one or 
more measures using χ2 tests and t-tests. Among respondents 
completing all measures, we report descriptives on baseline 
measures for three subsamples: full cross-sectional sample, 
longitudinal subsample of baseline never users of cigarettes 
and longitudinal subsample of baseline occasional users of ciga-
rettes. The relationship between e-cigarette and cigarette use 
was examined next in the same three subsamples. Self-rated 
smoking was validated against breath CO levels at baseline and 
follow-up using Games–Howell post hoc tests based on 1000 
bootstrapped resamples because the data were skewed and had 
unequal variances.
Given the problems with imputing values for outcome vari-
ables,27 attrition analyses were used to assess biases in all base-
line measures in those with and without matched follow-up 
data (at follow-up 1=data missing; 0=data available) in the two 
longitudinal subsamples using multilevel logistic regressions (in 
R) to assess model fit (Akaike Information Criterion) and, for 
each predictor, the odds ratios (OR), 95% CIs and p value. The 
main analyses used the same analysis to predict follow-up initi-
ation (1=smoked; 0=never smoked) or escalation (0=never, 
once or used to smoke cigarettes; 1=rarely, occasional or 
frequent cigarette smoking) of smoking based on ever use of 
e-cigarettes and covariates. E-cigarette use was dichotomised 
into never versus ever use due to few regular users. Model 1 
controlled for the clustering of adolescents within schools, and 
baseline e-cigarette ever use was a predictor; model 2 added 
baseline covariates; and model 3 tested interactions between 
each covariate and e-cigarettes ever use. To assess the impact 
of baseline missing values, we repeated the regressions with 
imputation.28

sample description
At baseline, full data were available on 2836 adolescents, who 
did not differ (p>0.05) from those with missing data (N=58–
92) on all measures except sex (p=0.001; boys less likely to have 
complete data) and norms (p=0.02; those with lower norms to 
not smoke less likely to have complete data).
Table 1 provides descriptive data on baseline measures for 
respondents who completed all measures. The cross-sectional 
sample (table 1) was mostly aged 13 years, approximately half 
boys, and a majority not having ever used e-cigarettes or ciga-
rettes. Levels of e-cigarette awareness and use were lower in the 
never smoking subsample (table 1: 80.0% heard of, 19.9% used 
e-cigarettes) compared with the subsample reporting occasional 
smoking (table 1: 90.0% heard of, 78.0% used e-cigarettes).
At baseline and follow-up, CO levels were low and not signifi-
cantly different between those reporting they never smoked, had 
only tried smoking once, used to smoke sometimes or smoked 
sometimes but not as many as one per week; CO levels were 
significantly higher (p<0.05) among those reporting they 
smoked 1–6 or >6 cigarettes per week but not significantly 
different across these latter two categories.
simple relationships between use of e-cigarettes and 
cigarettes
Table 2 reports the relationship between e-cigarette and cigarette 
use in the three subsamples. Table 2A shows the cross-sectional 
relationship: 61.5% of the sample had tried neither e-cigarettes 
nor cigarettes, 16.0% had tried e-cigarettes but not cigarettes, 
4.4% had tried cigarettes but not e-cigarettes and 18.2% had used 
both.
Table 2B shows the longitudinal relationship between base-
line e-cigarette use and follow-up cigarette use in the baseline

never smokers; initiation of cigarette use in the next 12 months 
rose from 9.0% to 34.4%, respectively, in baseline never versus 
ever used e-cigarettes. Baseline CO levels were low among the 
self-reported never smokers, and exclusion of adolescents with 
higher baseline CO levels (>2 
ppm) did not substantively change 
the regression findings. CO levels at follow-up were significantly 
higher among those classified as initiating compared with not 
initiating cigarette use (p<0.05).
Table 2C shows the longitudinal relationship between e-ciga-
rette use at baseline and escalation of cigarette use at follow-up 
among baseline occasional smokers; escalation in the next 12 
months rose from 12.9% to 24.2%, respectively, in those never 
versus ever having used e-cigarettes at baseline. Baseline CO 
levels were low among those self-reporting that they had only 
once used or former smokers and exclusion of adolescents with 
higher baseline CO levels (>2 
ppm) did not substantively change 
the regression findings. CO levels at follow-up were significantly 
higher among those classified as escalating versus not escalating 
smoking (p<0.001).
Attrition analyses
At baseline, 2196 adolescents (77.4%) reported never having 
smoked but only 1726 adolescents (78.6%) could be matched 
across time points. The similar number of adolescents completing 
questions at each time point (total N=2928 
and 2747 at baseline 
and follow-up, respectively) suggests that attrition was princi-
pally due to a failure to match personally generated codes.
Analyses (table 3) indicated no significant effects for base-
line ever used e-cigarettes, friends’ smoking, attitude, norms, 
perceived behavioural control, self-efficacy or free school meals 
on missingness; however, there were significant effects for sex 
(OR 0.70, 95% 
CI 0.56 to 0.86; girls less likely to be missing), 
family smoking (OR 1.53, 95% 
CI 1.10 to 2.12; with three or 
more family members who smoked more likely to be missing) 
and intention (OR 0.77, 95% 
CI 0.62 to 0.96; with weaker 
intentions not to smoke more likely to be missing).
At baseline, 497 adolescents reported trying or past use of 
cigarettes. We matched 318 adolescents (64.0%) across time 
points. Analyses indicated no significant effects for baseline 
ever used e-cigarettes, sex, family smoking, intention, attitude, 
perceived behavioural control, self-efficacy and free school meals 
on missingness (table 3); however, there were significant effects 
for friends’ smoking (OR 2.08, 95% 
CI 1.12 to 3.82 for few 
friends smoking; OR 4.33, 95% 
CI 2.10 to 8.95 for most friends 
smoking; with a few or most friends who smoked more likely to 
be missing) and perceived behavioural control (OR 0.64, 95% 
CI 
0.46 to 0.88; with weaker perceived behavioural control over 
not smoking more likely to be missing).
Prospective analyses
Initiation of cigarette use at follow-up was predicted by having ever 
used e-cigarettes at baseline (table 4, model 1; OR 5.38, 95% 
CI 
4.02 to 7.22) and remained so when controlling for covariates 
(table 4, model 2; OR 4.06, 95% 
CI 2.94 to 5.60). Initiation of 
cigarette use was significantly higher in adolescents who at baseline 
were ever users of e-cigarettes, had either a few or most friends 
who smoked and had one, two or three or more family members 
who smoked, but was significantly lower in adolescents with 
stronger intentions (not to smoke). Exploratory analyses revealed 
that baseline friends’ smoking was a statistically significant moder-
ator (p<0.001; all other moderators p>0.43). Decomposition 
of the moderation effect (table 4, model 3) indicated that the the 
impact of ever used e-cigarettes on likelihood of initiating cigarette 
use was attenuated among those with a few or most friends who 
smoked at baseline. Multiple imputation resulted in an additional 
28 cases in this analysis. The estimated model coefficients showed 
very little change (mostly <1%), and there was no change in the 
interpretation.
Table 4 also reports the results of the regressions to predict 
escalation of cigarette use at follow-up. In model 1, ever use 
of e-cigarettes at baseline was a significant predictor of escala-
tion of cigarette use (OR 2.16, 95% 
CI 1.01 to 4.62). In model 
2, ever use of e-cigarettes at baseline became a non-significant 
predictor of escalation when controlling for covariates (OR 
1.89, 95% 
CI 0.82 to 4.33). Escalation of cigarette use was 
significantly higher in adolescents who had most friends who

smoked, but was significantly lower in those adolescents with 
stronger attitudes (not to smoke) and intentions (not to smoke). 
Exploration of moderation effects revealed that two interac-
tions were statistically significant (attitudes, p=0.01; intentions, 
p=0.02), although decomposition of these effects did not reveal 
significant effects of e-cigarette use on escalation of cigarette use 
at different levels of either moderator (p>0.20). None of the 
other moderators approached statistical significance (p>0.16). 
Multiple imputation did not change any values or the analyses.
The ORs based on logistic regression analyses reported in 
table 4 may overestimate the degree of association between e-cig-
arette use and subsequent smoking because the prevalence of the 
outcome exceeds the usual 15% cut-off. To assess the degree of 
overestimation, we ran the initial models (model 1 in table 4) 
using a log binomial model. For the analyses of never smokers, 
the degree of association was reduced but remained statistically 
significant: incidence relative risk (IRR) was 3.85 (95% CI 3.07 
to 4.82), p<0.001. For the analyses of smoking escalation, the 
degree of association was also reduced and no longer statistically 
significant: IRR=1.81 (95% CI 095 to 3.44), p=0.071.

Research paper
(13–14 
years old) found patterns similar to those reported in 
longitudinal studies among adolescents aged 13–14 years and 
older16–19 in the USA with comparable sized ORs (the IRR was 
also of a comparable magnitude). Together, these studies suggest 
that it is unlikely that the high rates of dual use of e-cigarette 
and cigarette use observed in the USA5–7 and UK8–15 in cross-sec-
tional surveys of adolescents are entirely attributable to cigarette 
users subsequently taking up e-cigarettes. A significant minority 
of adolescents try e-cigarettes first (19.9% here) and later initiate 
cigarette use. Our findings also indicated that the association 
between ever use of e-cigarettes and initiation of cigarette use 
was particularly strong among adolescents with no friends who 
smoked, a group usually considered to be less susceptible to 
smoking initiation (see the study by Barrington-Trimis et al16 for 
similar moderation effect among those with low intentions to 
smoke). In relation to escalation of cigarette use, the OR showed 
that ever use of e-cigarettes is associated with subsequent esca-
lation, although this effect was attenuated when using the IRR 
or when controlling for covariates. However, given the limited 
numbers escalating their cigarette use in this study and lack 
of support in other studies, these findings should be treated 
cautiously (eg, other studies either did not find e-cigarette use 
to be related to change in frequency of smoking among baseline 
ever-smokers,19 or found that baseline frequency of use of e-cig-
arettes was only associated with follow-up smoking frequency 
among baseline non-smokers and not among baseline infrequent 
or frequent smokers29).
Our research provides limited insights into the mechanism 
relating ever use of e-cigarettes to subsequent initiation and esca-
lation of cigarette use. In principle, it is possible that e-cigarette 
use in adolescents is a marker for those who would have initi-
ated or escalated cigarette use even if e-cigarettes had not been 
available. Among such adolescents, the availability of e-cigarettes 
may have simply delayed initiation or escalation. However, at 
least in relation to initiation, the fact that e-cigarette use was a 
bigger risk factor in groups considered least at risk (ie, no friends 
who smoke at baseline) argues against this (see the study by 
Barrington-Trimis et al19 for a similar moderator effect also diffi-
cult to reconcile with this explanation). It is also plausible that 
the use of e-cigarettes might lead to initiation and escalation in 
cigarette use by normalising any kind of nicotine use, by devel-
oping nicotine addiction (if the e-cigarettes contain nicotine) or 
by developing friendship networks with smokers and decreasing 
the perceived risks of smoking.30–32 However, there is no direct 
evidence yet to suggest that ever use of e-cigarettes normalises 
cigarette use.
Given the lack of clarity regarding the mechanism linking 
e-cigarette and cigarette use, we need to be cautious in making 
policy recommendations based on our findings. We acknowl-
edge that since our survey, UK legislation has been put in place, 
including bans on marketing and selling e-cigarettes to minors. 
UK agencies are required to enforce age of sale, child and tamper 
proof packaging and display age of sale signage and health warn-
ings on e-cigarette packaging. Nevertheless, our findings empha-
sise the value of regulating the marketing and sale of e-cigarettes 
to minors in countries without such measures, particularly given 
that e-cigarette advertising has been shown to reduce perceived 
harm of occasional smoking.33
Our study’s strengths include a large demographically diverse 
sample, measurement of e-cigarette and cigarette use over 
12 
months, exploration of initiation and escalation of cigarette 
use, validation of smoking measures and exploration of covari-
ates and moderators not previously examined. There are also 
weaknesses. First, our study had a relatively high attrition. This 
was principally attributable to problems in matching partici-
pants’ personally generated anonymous codes, although attrition 
analyses indicated relatively modest biases in the final compared 
with initial sample. Second, like other similar studies, we focused 
on self-reported e-cigarette and cigarette use. Although we vali-
dated the self-reported smoking against an objective measure of 
CO, we did not have a way of validating e-cigarette use. Third, 
we failed to distinguish types of e-cigarette use (e-cigarettes vary 
in a number of ways, including the delivery method and whether 
they contain nicotine). Furthermore, our description of e-cig-
arettes and the timing of our survey might have restricted our 
study to first-generation devices, in which their nicotine delivery 
profile mimic less closely to cigarettes than do more recent gener-
ations.34 Exploring relationships between use of new generations 
of e-cigarettes both containing nicotine or not and subsequent 
cigarette use is an important issue for further research. The 
current research focused on cigarette use, although other studies 
have reported similar effects with various tobacco products.18
A fourth limitation concerns our main analyses (table 4), which 
were restricted to ever use of e-cigarettes, and we were unable to 
test whether more regular use of e-cigarettes was more strongly 
associated with initiating or escalating cigarette use (see table 2; see 
the study by Warner6 for cross-sectional data). Relatedly, our anal-
yses of impacts on escalation should be treated cautiously given the 
limited numbers escalating cigarette use during the period studied 
and the fact that our findings conflict with published work.19 Fifth, 
our research was restricted to a limited geographical area (two 
English counties), although it did extend findings from several US 
states. Sixth, our research focused on a limited age range (baseline: 
13–14 years; most published studies17–19 are with this age group). 
Future studies should explore effects in different aged adolescents 
and over varying time periods. Finally, our research could only 
consider a finite number of covariates and moderators, and it is 
plausible that important factors were omitted. Previous related 
studies16–19 have examined various other factors (eg, sensation 
seeking, impulsivity, other substance use, delinquent behaviour, 
academic performance and race/ethnicity). It would be valuable to 
test these additional covariates and moderating variables in future 
work.
In summary, this is the first study to report longitudinal rela-
tionships between ever use of e-cigarettes and initiation or esca-
lation of cigarette use among UK adolescents. Despite measuring 
and accounting for the influence of a broad range of variables in 
this and other studies,16–19 it is possible that any third variables 
could have been responsible for the observed relationships. There-
fore, while acknowledging that a causal relationship may be plau-
sible, we cannot confirm this based on our findings and the trends 
observed over the same time period in the UK; rates of e-cigarette 
use have increased, but the rates of cigarette use have continued to 
decline. Future research could seek to disentangle these apparently 
contrary findings and assess dose–response relationships between 
e-cigarette and cigarette use over longer-time periods in a broader 
age range of adolescents while controlling for a range of covariates 
and assessing the impact of antismoking interventions.

What this paper adds
Previous research: In cross-sectional surveys of UK adolescents, 
electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is increasing, cigarette use 
is decreasing and increasing numbers of adolescents report 
using both e-cigarettes and cigarettes. Several studies among 
US adolescents suggest that self-reported e-cigarette use is 
associated with subsequent initiation of cigarette use, whereas 
one study in US adolescents found no association between 
e-cigarette use and escalation of cigarette use. However, these 
studies were all conducted in the USA, did not validate their 
self-reported smoking measures against objective measures 
and assessed only a limited range of risk factors for smoking as 
covariates and moderators of these relationships.
Interpretation: Associations similar to those found in the 
previous studies are reported in a sample of UK adolescents and 
are validated against breath CO measures. Data collected over 
a 12-month period confirmed a sizeable relationship between 
ever use of e-cigarettes and subsequent initiation of cigarette 
use and showed that e-cigarette use is modestly associated with 
subsequent escalation of cigarette use. The former but not the 
latter relationship remained after controlling for various other 
risk factors for smoking (eg, intentions to smoke), only some 
of which had been assessed in previous studies. These findings 
support the robustness of the relationship between ever use 
of e-cigarettes and initiation of cigarette use but suggest the 
relationship between ever use of e-cigarettes and escalation of 
cigarette use may be explainable by other factors. Ever use of 
e-cigarettes was a stronger predictor of initiation of cigarette 
use in those with no friends who smoked at baseline compared 
with those with a few or most friends who smoked at baseline. 
The latter finding would not appear to be consistent with the 
suggestion that e-cigarette use may simply be a marker for those 
who would go on to smoke cigarettes even without having tried 
e-cigarettes.
