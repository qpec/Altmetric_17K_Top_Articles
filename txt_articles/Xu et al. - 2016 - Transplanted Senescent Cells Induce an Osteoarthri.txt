Abstract
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading form of arthritis in the elderly, causing pain, disability, and immobility. OA has been associated with 
accumulation of senescent cells in or near joints. However, evidence for a causal link between OA and cellular senescence is lacking. Here, 
we present a novel senescent cell transplantation model involving injection of small numbers of senescent or nonsenescent cells from the ear 
cartilage of luciferase-expressing mice into the knee joint area of wild-type mice. By using bioluminescence and 18FDG PET imaging, we could 
track the injected cells in vivo for more than 10 days. Transplanting senescent cells into the knee region caused leg pain, impaired mobility, and 
radiographic and histological changes suggestive of OA. Transplanting nonsenescent cells had less of these effects. Thus, senescent cells can 
induce an OA-like state and targeting senescent cells could be a promising strategy for treating OA.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the leading causes of pain and dis-
ability worldwide (1). It can greatly increase health care costs and 
reduce quality of life. The key characteristics of age-related OA in 
humans include damage of articular cartilage with joint space nar-
rowing, osteophyte formation, subchondral bone alteration, and 
degeneration of soft tissues (2). Age is the leading predictor for 
developing OA. Other risk factors include increased body weight, 
female sex, diet, genetics, race, and injuries (3). Injury-induced OA 
can be modeled in mice by damaging joints surgically (2). However, 
modeling age- or senescence-associated OA, which may be distinct 
from injury-related OA (2), in mice has been challenging. So far, no 
disease-modifying drug has been approved to treat OA other than 
pain reducers, partly because etiological mechanisms of age-related 
OA have been poorly understood to date (2). Potential cellular 
mechanisms contributing to the development of OA include low-
grade inflammation (4), chondrocyte alteration (5), mitochondrial 
dysfunction (6), loss of glycosaminoglycans (7), and dysregulated 
energy metabolism (8,9). In addition, a potential contribution by 
senescent cells has been suggested (10,11).
Cellular senescence refers to a state of stable arrest of cell pro-
liferation in replication-competent but apoptosis-resistant cells 
(12,13). Senescent cells accumulate with aging in various tissues 
(14), including the articular cartilage (15). A variety of stimuli 
and stresses can cause senescence, including telomere shortening, 
genomic DNA damage, oncogenic insults, metabolic stresses, epi-
genetic changes, and mitochondrial dysfunction (12,16). One key 
feature of senescent cells is secretion of an array of pro-inflam-
matory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, termed the 
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) (17,18). The 
SASP is observed across a number of senescent cell types, includ-
ing fibroblasts and mesenchymal stem cells (17,19). Although 
mounting evidence suggests that cellular senescence is associated 
with OA (10,11,20–22), whether this link is causal remains to be 
determined.

 We transplanted senescent cells into the knee joint region of mice 
and found that these cells induced a phenotype with features resem-
bling OA, including articular cartilage erosion, increased pain, and 
impaired function. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence sug-
gesting that cellular senescence can actually cause OA. Our findings 
also imply that targeting senescent cells is a promising approach for 
preventing or treating OA.

Establishing a Senescent Cell 
Transplantation Model
To test if senescent cells cause an OA-like arthropathy, we injected 
either senescent or control nonsenescent fibroblasts into the knee 
joint region of mice. We transplanted seven mice with control cells 
and seven with senescent cells. We isolated mouse fibroblasts from 
ear clips of CAG-luc mice and induced cellular senescence with 10 
Gy radiation. Twenty days after radiation, more than 95% of fibro-
blasts were senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SABG) positive, 
whereas less than 5% of nonradiated parallel control fibroblasts 
were SABG positive (Figure 1A). p16Ink4a and p21Cip1 transcript lev-
els, two key cellular senescence markers, were significantly increased 
in the radiated fibroblasts (Figure 1B). To assess the SASP, we col-
lected conditioned medium from radiated and control fibroblasts 
for 24 hours. Twenty-three cytokine and chemokine proteins were 
measured in conditioned medium using an addressable laser bead-
based multiplex assay. We found that the secreted protein levels of 
19 SASP components were significantly increased in conditioned 
medium collected from radiated fibroblasts compared with nonradi-
ated control cells (Supplementary Table 1). The most highly induced 
SASP components were: granulocyte-colony stimulating factor

 (G-CSF, 8-fold), interleukin-6 (IL-6, 20-fold), IFN-γ–induced protein 
10 (IP-10, 14-fold), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL-1, 
10-fold), and CXCL-9 (46-fold) (Figure 1C). These results suggested 
that radiation-induced senescent ear cartilage fibroblasts exhibited 
phenotypes typical of cellular senescence.
Because both the senescent and nonsenescent control cells 
expressed luciferase, we were able to track these injected cells in vivo 
by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) after transplantation. One day 
after injection, we detected a strong bioluminescent signal in and 
around the left knee joint region in mice in which either senescent or 
nonsenescent fibroblasts had been injected (Figure 1D). These signals 
persisted for more than 10 days (Supplementary Figure 1), indicat-
ing that the transplanted cells were viable in the knee area for at 
least 10 days. We did not observe detectable bioluminescent signal 
in any of the mice in the right knee region, where buffer without 
cells had been injected. Increased glucose utilization is a feature of 
senescent cells (23,24). We tested whether we could detect the trans-
planted senescent cells using 18fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography (FDG PET) imaging, a labeled, nonmetabolized glucose 
analog, in our model. Three days after transplantation, we found 
that the 18FDG PET standard uptake value (F-SUV) was significantly 
higher in the left knee joint region injected with senescent cells com-
pared with the animals injected with control nonsenescent cells or 
buffer (Figure 1E and F). The F-SUV ratios of the left to the right 
knees within the same mice were also about 50% higher in the senes-
cent compared with control nonsenescent cell-transplanted groups 
(Figure 1G). These results suggest it is feasible to detect senescent 
cells in vivo and to distinguish them from nonsenescent cells using 
glucose analog PET imaging.
Senescent Cell 
Transplantation Induces an OA-Like 
Phenotype and Impairs Function
Three months after cell injection, senescent and nonsenescent cell-
injected knees were evaluated histologically and radiologically to 
assess articular cartilage and overall joint structure (Figure 2A and 
B). The senescent cell-injected knees exhibited severe articular carti-
lage damage at the lateral and medial tibial plateaus, as well as the 
femoral condyles (Figure 2A). Reduced Safranin O staining (cartilage 
content), erosion of articular cartilage, and delamination of the artic-
ular surface were evident (Figure 2A). Senescent cell-injected knees 
displayed significant erosion within the medial joint spaces down 
to the growth plate (histology score = 16.8 
± 
3.1) and erosion of the 
lateral femoral condyles, which was also observed radiologically 
(Figure 2C). Moreover, senescent cell-injected knees exhibited osteo-
phyte formation, subchondral bone structure alteration, and dam-
aged menisci, hallmarks of OA (Figure 2C, arrows). We did observe 
some damage to the nonsenescent cell-injected knees (Figure 2B) 
within the medial joint spaces (histology score = 5.7 
± 
3.3); however, 
this damage was significantly less than in the senescent cell-trans-
planted knees (Figure 2B). We postulate that some of the damage to 
the control nonsenescent cell-injected joint resulted from the rela-
tively large volume (50 μL) injected into the knee area.
OA-associated pain is a key, disabling complaint of patients 
suffering from OA. We examined whether transplantation of 
senescent cells increased pain by performing the von Frey fila-
ment assay. Senescent cell-injected left knees showed a trend to 
increased paw withdrawal (p = .061) when using 0.16 
g monofila-
ments (Figure 2D). With greater fiber bowing weight (0.4 
g), mice 
with the senescent cell-injected left knees had significantly increased 
mechanical hypersensitivity compared with the mice with control 
nonsenescent cell-injected left knees (Figure 2E). Pain sensitivity in 
senescent cell-injected left knees was also significantly higher than 
buffer-injected right knees within the same animals, but there was no 
significant difference between nonsenescent cell-injected and buffer-
injected knees (Figure 2E). These data indicate that injection of 
senescent cells in and around the joint space of the knee causes pain.
We next tested whether senescent cell transplantation into knees 
impaired locomotor function. We found that Rotarod performance 
was significantly decreased in the mice injected with senescent cells 
compared with animals injected with control nonsenescent cells or 
those that were not injected (Figure 2F). In addition, we found that 
mice injected with senescent cells moved less and traveled shorter dis-
tances than mice injected with control nonsenescent cells (Figure 2F 
and G). Thus, senescent cell transplantation causes reduced locomo-
tor function in mice.
Discussion
OA is a major cause of pain, immobility, and disability in the elderly 
(1). No disease-modifying interventions are now in clinical use, 
with current treatments focused on pain control, mobility aides 
such as canes, braces, or walkers, or surgical joint replacement (25). 
Impeding progress in developing disease-modifying treatments is a 
lack of understanding of the initial pathogenesis of age-related OA 
and a lack of mouse models of this condition, as opposed to the sur-
gical damage-induced OA in mice that models injury-associated OA. 
Here, we provide evidence that accumulation of senescent cells in 
and around previously healthy joints can actually cause an OA-like 
arthropathy in mice. This both provides a new model of OA and 
implies that clearing senescent cells with senolytics or interfering 
with their pro-inflammatory SASP could be a disease-modifying 
therapeutic option. A next step will be to test such interventions in 
our senescent cell-transplanted model.
One of the potential mechanisms by which senescent cells could 
induce an OA-like phenotype is through the SASP. OA is linked to 
inflammation (4) and immune cells have been found in early stage 
OA (26). IL-6, one of the key SASP components, is highly associated 
with OA progression (27,28). We found that the senescent cells we 
transplanted secreted 20 times more IL-6 than nonsenescent cells 
(Figure 1C and Supplementary Table 1). We previously reported 
that senescent cells increase immune cell chemoattraction (19). 
Furthermore, immune cell chemokines, such as the macrophage che-
moattractant, MCP-1, were secreted by the senescent cells we trans-
planted (Supplementary Table 1). Thus, senescent cell-provoked 
immune cell infiltration and the inflammation that they, in turn, 
induce might contribute to the OA-like phenotype we observed. 
In addition, senescent cells can directly impair progenitor function 
through the SASP (29) and spread senescence to nearby cells (30,31), 
both of which might contribute to dysfunction of chondrocytes and 
therefore to OA. Moreover, transplanted senescent cells might persist 
longer than nonsenescent cells in vivo due to the fact that they are 
resistant to apoptosis (13), which could allow them more time to 
damage the knee.
In our model, we transplanted 2 
× 
105 ear fibroblasts into the knee 
joint region. It will be important to ascertain the minimum number 
of injected senescent cells sufficient to induce the OA-like phenotype. 
In addition, extensive studies comparing effects of different trans-
planted senescent cell types (such as chondrocytes or mesenchymal 
stem cells), dose responses, effects of gender, effects of recipient age, 
use of other species such as rats, persistence of different types of 
transplanted cells, use of different drugs such as senolytics and SASP 
inhibitors after transplantation, additive effects of stressing the joints

 around which senescent cells have been transplanted, time course of 
histological changes to the knee following senescent cell transplanta-
tion, and many other analyses remain to be done to fully characterize 
this model.
One of the limitations of our model is that the injection itself 
might cause minor damage to the joint, which we did observe in some 
of the nonsenescent cell-injected joints (Figure 2B). We speculate that 
some of the damage to the control nonsenescent cell-injected joints 
resulted from the injection itself or the fact that some of nonsenescent 
cells possibly become senescent in vivo after injection. However, the 
damage to the senescent cell-injected joints was significantly more 
severe (Figure 2B). Additionally, only senescent cell-injected knees 
exhibited mechanical allodynia (Figure 2E), indicating that senescent 
cells contribute to the pain that is a consequence of OA. Advantages 
of our model are that it is relatively simple and it does not require 
breeding of genetically modified mice. Also, animals can be followed 
in real time in vivo during development of OA or before and after 
administering interventions by functional and pain testing and lucif-
erase and PET imaging. Specifically, senescent cell abundance can be 
followed. Moreover, our model is clinically relevant because senes-
cent cells accumulate within the joints in both OA patients (22) and 
aged individuals (15).
The finding that cellular senescence can drive development of 
an OA-like state is consistent with the geroscience hypothesis—that

 fundamental aging mechanisms, of which cellular senescence is one, 
predispose to age-related disabilities and chronic diseases, such as 
OA. If correct, this would imply that senescent cell accumulation 
may not only predispose to OA, but to multiple other age-related 
conditions, as is increasingly appearing to be the case (19,29,32–34). 
The fact that we were able to detect senescent cells in vivo using 
18FDG PET imaging without any genetic modification (Figure 1E) 
might open a potential avenue to assess senescent cell burden in 
humans with a variety of conditions involving local accumulation 
of senescent cells, such as in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or at sites 
subjected to therapeutic radiation.
A variety of anti-inflammatory agents have been used for OA, 
mainly for pain control. They have not proven to be effective in 
modifying disease progression (2). Furthermore, these agents have 
side effects and toxicity due to continuous administration (35). 
Therefore, a novel therapeutic strategy is needed. Our findings 
increase the likelihood that senolytic agents or SASP inhibitors will 
be disease modifying. Based on a hypothesis-driven drug discovery 
approach, we recently identified agents that eliminate senescent cells 
selectively—senolytic drugs (33,36). We predict that senolytics or 
SASP inhibitors such as ruxolitinib, which decreases IL-6 secretion 
and effects by senescent cells and also alleviates the senescent cell-
induced stem cell dysfunction caused by TGFβ-related SASP factors 
(19,29), will delay, prevent, or alleviate OA. Consistent with this 
possibility, we found that senolytics attenuate age-related loss of 
glycosaminoglycans, a contributor to developing OA (7), from the 
intervertebral discs of progeroid mice (33). Moreover, senolytics are 
effective when administered periodically (33), likely because senes-
cent cells do not of course divide and may be slow to re-accumulate 
once cleared in the absence of a strong continuing insult. We predict 
that senolytics may have fewer side effects than the anti-inflamma-
tory agents currently used for controlling pain.
In summary, our study indicates that senescent cells can directly 
contribute to the pathogenesis of OA. We also present a novel model 
of OA, which is clinically relevant and allows us and others to test 
whether clearing senescent cells or interfering with the SASP alle-
viates or delays OA. Thus, our model could be useful for the OA 
research field in conjunction with current surgical injury-based mod-
els. Targeting senescent cells might be a promising way to delay, pre-
vent, or treat OA.
