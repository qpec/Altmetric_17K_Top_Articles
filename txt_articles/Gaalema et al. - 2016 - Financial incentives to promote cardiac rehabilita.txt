Abstract
Purpose—Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) improves medical outcomes after myocardial infarction or 
coronary revascularization. Lower socioeconomic status (SES) patients are less likely to 
participate in and complete CR. The aim of this study was to test whether financial incentives may 
increase participation and adherence to CR among lower-SES patients.
Methods—Patients eligible to participate in CR with Medicaid insurance coverage were 
approached for inclusion. Patients were placed on an escalating incentive schedule of financial 
incentives contingent upon CR attendance. CR participation was compared to a usual care group 
of 101 Medicaid patients eligible for CR in the 18 months prior to the study. Attendance 
(participating in ≥ one CR sessions) and adherence (sessions completed out of 36) were compared 
between groups. Study conducted in Vermont, USA, 2013–2015.
Results—Of 13 patients approached to be in the study and receive incentives, 10 (77%) agreed to 
participate. All 10 patients completed at least one session of CR, significantly greater than the 
25/101 (25%) in the control condition (p < 0.001). Of patients in both groups who attended at least 
one session of CR, adherence was higher in the intervention group (average of 31.1 sessions 
completed vs. 13.6 in the control group, p < 0.001). CR completion rates were also higher during 
the intervention with 8 of 10 (80%) intervention patients completing all 36 sessions compared to 
only 2 of 25 (8%) control patients (p < 0.001).
Conclusions—Financial incentives may be an efficacious strategy for increasing CR 
participation and adherence among Medicaid patients.

Introduction
Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an individualized, structured, progressive exercise program 
with interventions for coronary risk factor reduction that is highly effective at reducing 
morbidity and mortality rates following a myocardial infarction (MI) or coronary 
revascularization (Lawler et al., 2011; Wenger, 2008). Participation in CR is associated with 
a 26–36% decrease in cardiac mortality over 2–3 years and a 31% reduction in cardiac re-
hospitalizations over 12 months (Lawler et al., 2011; Heran et al., 2011).
Individuals at especially high risk of morbidity and mortality following a cardiac event 
should be targeted for CR participation. Lower-socioeconomic status (SES) populations are 
particularly high risk patients with greater rates of smoking, hypertension, diabetes, obesity 
and physical inactivity (Albert et al., 2006; Alter et al., 2013; Govil et al., 2009; Oberg et al., 
2009). Even though this high-risk profile consists of behaviorally modifiable factors, lower-
SES patients are more likely to be re-hospitalized and have higher mortality rates following 
an MI than more affluent patients (Alter et al., 2006; 2013; Bernheim et al., 2007; Kind et 
al., 2014).
Lower-SES status is also a robust predictor of CR non-participation. While overall, 19% of 
older adults (≥65 years) attended CR as recommended, only 3–5% of those with dual 
Medicare/Medicaid status (i.e., lower-SES) (Suaya et al., 2007). In a study of 322 CR 
eligible Medicaid patients in Washington state, only two (< 1%) attended CR within the year 
following their MI (Oberg et al., 2009). Clearly, interventions are needed to increase CR 
participation in this high-risk population.
A variety of interventions have been employed to increase uptake of and adherence to CR. A 
systematic review noted that even in the general population evidence was weak that 
interventions (e.g. early appointments after discharge, nurse reminder calls) were successful 
at increasing CR uptake. Additionally, no recommendation could be made for programs that 
increased adherence (Karmali et al., 2014).
Incentive-based interventions are highly effective at altering health-related behaviors among 
disadvantaged populations (Higgins et al., 2012; Meredith et al., 2014). Providing financial 
incentives contingent on objective evidence of behavior change, was developed as a method 
to encourage cocaine abstinence (reviewed in Higgins et al., 2008). Incentive-based 
treatments have subsequently been shown to be effective at increasing abstinence from 
various drugs (Lussier et al., 2006). A meta-analysis of treatments for smoking during 
pregnancy showed an incentive-based approach was significantly more effective at 
promoting abstinence than other behavioral or pharmacological therapies (Lumley, et al., 
2009). Similar results have been observed when targeting other health-related behaviors in 
lower-SES populations (Higgins et al., 2012).

 The aim of the present study was to examine the feasibility and potential efficacy of 
financial incentives to increase CR participation and adherence in lower-SES patients.
Methods
Prior to study implementation we examined records of all Medicaid patients over an 18-
month period hospitalized for a MI, coronary revascularization, or heart valve surgery who 
lived in the catchment area for the University of Vermont Medical Center CR program. The 
catchment area is approximately 1600 km2, the vast majority of patients live within a 30 
minute drive of the clinic. A total of 113 patients met these criteria. The records were further 
restricted to those under age 80 to make the historical controls more comparable to the study 
sample, as no patient over 80 was deemed eligible for the intervention. The final control 
sample consisted of 101 patients. Basic demographic information on controls (sex, 
qualifying diagnosis, age) was drawn from clinical records as was number of CR sessions 
attended (36 possible).
The incentive intervention was implemented within a month after collection of the 
information on controls. Patients were eligible if they were (a) hospitalized for an MI, 
coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary intervention, or heart valve surgery, 
(b) enrolled in a state-supported insurance plan for low-income individuals (Medicaid), and 
(c) lived within the CR program catchment area. Patients with dementia, advanced cancer, 
significant frailty, or other systemic disease that would preclude CR participation were 
excluded. Sixteen patients were identified as potentially eligible over a 4-month period. 
Three patients, all over the age of 80, were excluded due to criteria listed above. Thirteen 
patients were approached with 10 (77%) consenting to participate. Of the 3 patients who 
declined, 2 cited no interest in CR due to other medical issues and the third declined due to 
lack of transportation.
The University of Vermont Medical Center CR program is described elsewhere (Savage et 
al., 2009). Briefly, the program consists of 2 or 3 supervised exercise sessions per week over 
a 3–4 month period (maximum 36 sessions). The CR program is individualized, based on 
functional capacity and goals for cardiovascular risk factor reduction. Exercise modalities 
employed include treadmills; elliptical trainers; seated steppers; and cycling, arm and rowing 
ergometers. Exercise duration is gradually increased to approximately 45 minutes of aerobic 
exercise. When appropriate, resistance training is included. Patients are encouraged to attend 
weekly educational sessions focusing on risk factor control.
Study participants received financial incentives for completing each of the 36 exercise 
sessions. Participation, verified by CR staff, was defined as attending and completing the 
scheduled prescribed exercise. Incentives were provided immediately following the 
completed session in cash or check. Participation in the initial exercise session earned $20. 
Subsequent sessions were incentivized on an escalating schedule starting at $4 and 
increasing by $2 for each consecutive session up to a maximum of $70 per session. Failure 
to attend a scheduled session, without valid excuse, resulted in a reset of the incentive value. 
Following a reset, the participant could receive $4 at the next session attended, $6 at the 
second consecutive session attended, and would return to the level of their previous progress

 at the third consecutive session attended. This schedule of escalating value incentives 
combined with a reset contingency has been experimentally demonstrated to be more 
effective than a fixed schedule at promoting continuous adherence (Roll & Higgins, 2000). 
Maximum possible incentive earnings were $1,368.
The same definition for CR attendance and adherence was used in both conditions. 
Attendance was defined as having attended even one session of CR and adherence as the 
number of sessions completed (36 possible). Basic demographics and CR attendance and 
adherence were compared between incentivized and control patients using Fisher’s Exact 
Test and Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. This study was approved by the local institutional review 
board.
Results
Baseline characteristics are listed in Table 1 (top panel). Mean age was 59 years, most 
patients were male and qualified for CR as a result of a MI. Age, sex, and qualifying 
diagnosis did not differ between the study conditions. Within the patients who attended CR 
(Table 1, bottom panel), the two study conditions did not differ significantly on measured 
characteristics.
To assess attendance, participation in one or more sessions was compared between all 
patients approached for the intervention (n=13) and historical controls (n=101). This method 
minimizes inflation of attendance rates in the study population by accounting for those who 
declined the study, and would likely not attend CR. Of 13 patients approached, 10 (77%) 
consented and attended at least one CR session. This 77% attendance rate is significantly 
greater than the 25% (25/101) in controls (p < 0.001).
To examine adherence, number of sessions completed among those who attended at least 
one CR session was compared between conditions (Figure 1). For patients who attended any 
CR, incentivized patients completed more sessions than controls (mean sessions completed 
31.1 vs. 13.6, p <0.001). Rate of completion also differed significantly with 8 of 10 (80%) 
incentivized patients completing all 36 sessions, compared to only 2 of 25 (8%) controls (p 
< 0.001). Incentivized patients were also compliant. Of 372 scheduled visits there were only 
61 (16%) missed visits and only 9 (2%) were unexcused absences. Incentive earnings 
averaged $878±179.3.
Discussion
The present results are encouraging regarding the feasibility and efficacy of financial 
incentives for increasing CR attendance and adherence in Medicaid-enrolled patients. 
Seventy-seven percent of patients offered the opportunity to participate in the incentivized 
intervention accepted, and the intervention resulted in greater levels of participation and 
adherence compared to controls.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the efficacy of financial incentives for 
increasing CR attendance and adherence. Previous attempts at improving adherence in CR 
have been largely ineffective (Karmali et al., 2014); however, some success was garnered in

 a quality improvement project that included small, non-financial incentives (Pack et al., 
2013). Improving CR participation in lower-SES patients is critical given their high risk 
factor burden (Albert et al., 2006; Alter et al., 2013; Govil et al., 2009) and poor 
participation rates (Suaya et al., 2007; Oberg et al., 2009). High risk factor burdens have led 
to higher rates of re-hospitalization (Alter et al., 2006; 2013; Bernheim et al., 2007; Kind et 
al., 2014) and mortality with lower-SES populations having a 1-year post-discharge death 
rate of 5% compared to 2% among higher-SES patients (Alter, et al., 2006). However, 
increased mortality and hospitalization rates are significantly attenuated by statistically 
controlling for behaviorally modifiable cardiac risk factors such as diabetes, obesity, and 
smoking (Alter et al., 2006; Bernheim et al., 2007). This constellation of co-existing 
conditions makes the lower-SES population high-risk. Accordingly, enhancing CR 
participation in lower-SES populations has the potential to modify many risk factors 
possibly reducing re-hospitalization and mortality rates. Importantly, lower-SES patients 
who attend CR have comparable improvements in risk factors as higher-SES patients (Govil 
et al., 2009).
Despite the benefits of CR, promoting participation among lower-SES patients is 
challenging. Reviews of barriers to CR in the general population describe a variety of 
challenges including transportation, family obligations, and co-occurring illness (Neubeck et 
al., 2012; Daly et al., 2002). One oft-cited challenge is costs. However, reducing financial 
barriers alone does not ensure participation. As was seen in the control condition for this 
study, although patients had Medicaid, and no co-pays, patients rarely attended. In another 
study, even when offering reimbursement of all out-of-pocket costs, college graduates were 
still 71% more likely to participate in CR than high school graduates (Harlan et al., 1995). 
More intensive and innovative interventions appear to be necessary.
One advantage of incentive-based interventions is that they provide an immediate, positive 
consequence following the target behavior. This positive consequence can help overcome 
some potential negative consequences of beginning CR (e.g. pain, discomfort or 
embarrassment). Additionally, the continued receipt of incentives can help bridge the 
temporal gap between the proximal CR demands and more distal positive health benefits of 
successful participation (e.g. improved endurance or mobility) (Higgins et al., 2012). 
Sensitivity to delay to benefits, sometimes described as delay discounting, varies within a 
population and aversion to delays has been associated both with lower-SES status and with 
suboptimal health behaviors (e.g. Daugherty and Brase, 2010). For those with a pronounced 
aversion to delayed rewards, distant and probabilistic outcomes may have little influence 
over current behavior. Financial incentives can be a useful way to overcome that bias.
Considering the high-risk profile of this population, incentivizing CR participation could 
prove cost-effective through several mechanisms. Increased attendance results in more 
clinical contact and provides time for prompts from medical staff to improve health-related 
behaviors such as medication adherence and smoking cessation. Improvements in health-
related behaviors could decrease re-hospitalizations (e.g. Kind et al., 2014). Indeed, the use 
of incentives to improve health behaviors has been gaining mainstream recognition as 
companies work to contain healthcare costs (Mattke et al., 2013).

 Given the apparent success of the use of incentives, an important consideration would be 
how to implement program into CR. Studies have discussed some potential legal 
considerations of implementing these programs into clinical care (e.g. Pack et al., 2013). 
Future studies should be conducted to test the efficacy and optimal parameters of 
incentivizing participation and adherence within CR as well as determine how to best 
implement a program into general practice. Importantly, the potential for financial incentives 
to facilitate primary and secondary preventive services was integrated into the Affordable 
Care Act. Section 4108 of the Affordable Care Act mandated Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services to allocate 100 million dollars to investigate the use of financial 
incentives to promote health-related behavior change among Medicaid beneficiaries (CMS, 
2015).
This study has limitations. Participants were not randomly assigned to study conditions and 
there may have been undetected differences in patient characteristics across conditions as 
less information was available for those in the control compared to intervention conditions. 
The study population was also relatively small and consisted mostly of men. The number of 
racial/ethnic minorities was limited, however the 12–20% minorities included is greater than 
is seen in the local population (7.8%). Referral practices may have differed between the two 
conditions. While participants in the intervention condition were approached in person and 
told about CR, we cannot be sure that patients in the control condition were similarly 
referred. Additionally, participants in the intervention condition may have benefited from 
increased staff interaction, although no methods other than providing the incentives were 
used to promote attendance. Limitations notwithstanding, this trial provides encouraging 
evidence supporting the potential utility of financial incentives for improving CR attendance 
and adherence in lower-SES patients. These encouraging results appear to warrant follow-up 
with a fully randomized controlled clinical trial.
