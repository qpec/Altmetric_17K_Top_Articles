SUMMARY
While beneficial effects of fasting on organismal function and health are well appreciated, we 
know little about the molecular details of how fasting influences synaptic function and plasticity. 
Our genetic and electrophysiological experiments demonstrate that acute fasting blocks retrograde 
synaptic enhancement that is normally triggered as a result of reduction in postsynaptic receptor 
function at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). This negative regulation critically 
depends on transcriptional enhancement of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein (4E-BP) 
under the control of the transcription factor Forkhead box O (Foxo). Furthermore, our findings 
indicate that postsynaptic 4E-BP exerts a constitutive negative input, which is counteracted by a 
positive regulatory input from the Target of Rapamycin (TOR). This combinatorial retrograde 
signaling plays a key role in regulating synaptic strength. Our results provide a mechanistic insight 
into how cellular stress and nutritional scarcity could acutely influence synaptic homeostasis and 
functional stability in neural circuits.
INTRODUCTION
Many forms of dietary restriction can reduce cellular stress, improve organismal health and 
in many instances extend life span in a number of model organisms (Longo and Mattson, 
2014; Pani, 2015). A major cellular function that is highly sensitive to nutrient intake from 
yeast to mammals is cap-dependent translation under the regulation of the target of 
rapamycin (TOR) (Bar-Peled and Sabatini, 2014). TOR promotes cap-dependent translation 
primarily through phosphorylation of 4E-BPs (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding 
proteins) and p70 S6Ks (S6 ribosomal protein kinases) (Ma and Blenis, 2009; Sonenberg 
and Hinnebusch, 2009). Phosphorylation of 4E-BP suppresses its ability to bind and inhibit 
the interaction between eIF4E (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E) and the initiation factor 
eIF4G, a critical step for translation initiation (Gingras et al., 1999). In addition to the 
regulation by TOR, 4E-BP undergoes upregulation in response to dietary restriction and 
starvation (Junger et al., 2003; Teleman et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2012; Zid et al., 2009).

 Together these two responses result in a strong inhibition of protein synthesis and act as a 
metabolic brake. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that fasting-induced increase in ketone 
bodies influences neuronal excitability and aspects of neurotransmitter release (Juge et al., 
2010; Lee et al., 2002; Ma et al., 2007); however, little is known about how different forms 
of dietary restriction, by influencing protein translation, can exert an effect on the regulation 
of synaptic function and plasticity.
At the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the genetic removal of GluRIIA, 
one of five glutamate receptor subunits, reduces the postsynaptic response to unitary release 
of neurotransmitter. As a result of this reduced response to neurotransmitter, a retrograde 
signal is triggered in the postsynaptic muscle that ultimately leads to a compensatory 
enhancement in presynaptic release from the motor neuron, a process that is conserved at the 
vertebrate NMJs (Petersen et al., 1997; Sandrock et al., 1997). The maintenance of this 
homeostatic synaptic compensation or retrograde synaptic enhancement is highly sensitive 
to postsynaptic cap-dependent translation in Drosophila; mutations in either Target of 
Rapamycin (TOR) or eIF4E can dominantly suppress the synaptic compensation in GluRIIA 
mutants (Penney et al., 2012). Interestingly, postsynaptic overexpression of TOR or S6K, in 
an otherwise wild type muscle, is also sufficient to trigger a retrograde enhancement in 
presynaptic neurotransmitter release, suggesting that normal synaptic strength may be 
affected by a postsynaptic signal form the muscle (Penney et al., 2012).
Our previous findings have demonstrated that postsynaptic translation plays a critical role in 
the regulation of retrograde synaptic enhancement at the NMJ. Therefore, in light of the 
effect of dietary restriction on TOR-dependent translation, we set out to investigate the 
consequence of nutrient restriction on retrograde synaptic compensation in GluRIIA 
mutants. Our electrophysiological analysis indicates that acute fasting, but not amino acid 
restriction, blocks this retrograde synaptic compensation. We show that this block is not 
merely due to reduced TOR activity, but rather a result of transcriptional upregulation of 
postsynaptic 4E-BP under the control of the transcription factor Foxo. Our results indicate 
that the retrograde regulation of synaptic strength at the NMJ depends on the balance 
between 4E-BP and TOR.
RESULTS
4E-BP is a negative regulator of synaptic strength
Postsynaptic TOR activity can lead to a retrograde enhancement of presynaptic 
neurotransmitter release (Penney et al., 2012). It is well appreciated that eIF4E’s ability to 
bind eIF4G, a critical step prior to the initiation of translation, is inhibited by 4E-BP 
(Marcotrigiano et al., 1999). TOR enhances translation by phosphorylating and inhibiting 
4E-BP, thereby curtailing its ability to bind eIF4E (Pause et al., 1994). Therefore, we 
predicted that loss of 4E-BP might lead to an increase in neurotransmitter release at the 
NMJ. We used two well-characterized 4E-BP mutant flies, 4E-BP1 (thor1) and 4E-BPΔ 
(thor2); 4E-BPΔ contains a deletion in the 4E-BP gene that was generated by the imprecise 
excision of the p-element insert in 4E-BP1 (Bernal and Kimbrell, 2000; Tettweiler et al., 
2005). In addition, we examined combinations of thor2 and a deficiency (Df(2L)tim-02) fly 
that uncovers the 4E-BP gene. Our electrophysiological examination of these 4E-BP mutant

 combinations revealed a dramatic increase in evoked excitatory junctional currents (EJCs) 
(Figures 1A and 1B; see Table S1 for statistics). Further quantification showed that in 4E-
BP mutant larvae QC (QC) was significantly larger than control counterparts, while quantal 
size (the average amplitude of miniature excitatory junctional currents, mEJCs) was 
unaffected (Figure 1B).
Two sets of experiments indicated that the increase in synaptic transmission observed in 
these mutant combinations was indeed due to loss of 4E-BP. First, we did not find any 
increase in QC in 4E-BP1 revertants (4E-BPRev), in which the p-element in 4E-BP1 was 
excised precisely leaving the 4E-BP gene intact (Bernal and Kimbrell, 2000) (Figure 1B). 
Second, we were able to restore normal synaptic function through transgenic rescue 
experiments: we found that transgenic expression of 4E-BP in muscles, but not in motor 
neurons, was capable of restoring normal synaptic function in 4E-BP mutant larvae (Figures 
1C and 1D). This is consistent with the role of postsynaptic translation in the retrograde 
regulation of presynaptic neurotransmitter release at the NMJ, and supports the idea that an 
increase in eIF4E availability can change the level of neurotransmitter release at the NMJ.
We did not find a change in the distribution of mEJC amplitudes in 4E-BP mutants (Figure 
S1A–S1C), suggesting that the increase in QC might depend on a presynaptic alteration in 
release probability. To test this possibility, we conducted failure analysis (see experimental 
procedures), and found that 4E-BP mutant larvae showed fewer failures at low calcium 
conditions (Figure 1E), providing strong support that the increase in QC in 4E-BP mutants 
was due to an enhancement in presynaptic release.
Finally to rule out the possibility that the increase in presynaptic release was a result of a 
significant change in synaptic structural growth, we examined NMJ growth in 4E-BP loss-
of-function mutant larvae. We found no significant differences in the total number of type 1 
synaptic boutons per muscle surface area at NMJs on muscles 6/7 (Figure 1G) or muscle 4 
(Figures S1D–S1F), when 4E-BPΔ and 4E-BPRev homozygous larvae were compared. 
Similarly, we did not observe any significant change in the fluorescence intensity associated 
with antibody staining against glutamate receptor subunits GluRIIA or GluRIIC (Figures 
S1G–S1I). In addition, the fluorescence intensity of presynaptic active zones (as marked by 
antibody staining against active zone marker Bruch pilot, Brp) (Kittel et al., 2006) as well as 
the active zone density per synaptic area (covered by neuronal marker HRP) were unaffected 
in 4E-BP mutants (Figures 1F and 1G, S1J).
Interestingly, Sigrist et al., (2000) have reported changes in synaptic structures in response to 
eIF4E muscle overexpression (Sigrist et al., 2000). While loss of 4E-BP and overexpression 
of eIF4E may be thought of as similar translational manipulations, they may have different 
consequences in vivo. Indeed, 4E-BP mutant flies and mice do not show any increase in size 
or weight (Teleman et al., 2005; Tsukiyama-Kohara et al., 2001). One possible explanation 
is that in 4E-BP (homozygous viable) mutants compensatory mechanisms may have 
dampened the expected growth pathways normally induced by promoting cap-dependent 
translation. Nevertheless, differential consequence of loss of 4E-BP for synaptic structure 
and function is consistent with other translational manipulations that influence retrograde

 synaptic enhancement without significantly influencing synaptic growth (Penney et al., 
2012; Penney et al., 2016).
These results together demonstrate that 4E-BP acts in postsynaptic muscles to negatively 
control synaptic release in a retrograde manner, thereby modulating neurotransmitter release 
at the NMJ.
Acute fasting suppresses retrograde synaptic enhancement in a 4E-BP dependent manner
As both TOR and 4E-BP respond to conditions of nutrient restriction, we set out to test the 
effect of dietary restriction on synaptic function at the NMJ. We raised wild type and 
GluRIIA mutant larvae on standard food (see experimental procedure) until mid 3rd instar 
larvae (110–120 hours after egg laying before fully emerged from food). We then transferred 
larvae either to a vial with standard food (Food) or only agar (no Food) for six hours 
followed by electrophysiological assessment. We found no significant changes in the 
baseline electrophysiological properties in wild type larvae after six hours of fasting. On the 
other hand, we found a robust block of synaptic compensation in GluRIIA mutant larvae 
(Figures 2A and 2B), suggesting that the effect of acute fasting specifically manifests as a 
block of synaptic compensation rather than a general defect of presynaptic release. To better 
resolve the temporal nature of the effect of fasting, we shortened the duration of fasting prior 
to electrophysiological recordings. We found that up to one hour of fasting had no effect on 
synaptic compensation, but as little as three hours of fasting was sufficient to block synaptic 
compensation (Figure 2C).
In addition to the developmentally sustained synaptic compensation in GluRIIA mutant 
larvae, synaptic compensation can be triggered acutely at the Drosophila larval NMJ as a 
result of exposure to the channel blocker philanthotoxin (PTX) (Frank et al., 2006). 
Interestingly, the larvae maintained their ability to show PTX-induced synaptic 
compensation after six hours of fasting. This suggests that, like postsynaptic translation 
(Cheng et al., 2011; Frank et al., 2006; Penney et al., 2012; Penney et al., 2016), fasting 
differentially regulates developmentally sustained synaptic compensation versus acutely 
induced synaptic compensation (Figure S2A). These results also suggest that fasting does 
not affect the fundamental ability of the NMJ to upregulate presynaptic neurotransmitter 
release when faced with the demand.
Finally, we set out to address whether six hours of fasting could have influenced synaptic 
structures in GluRIIA mutant larvae. Our analysis did not detect any statistically significant 
differences in the total number of type 1 boutons per muscle surface area or the density of 
presynaptic active zones per synaptic area (see experimental procedure), or any change in 
the presence of ghost boutons that are thought of as early structural features detected at the 
NMJ following spaced depolarization (Ataman et al., 2008) (Figure 2D and 2E, Figure 
S2B). These findings rule out the possibility that acute fasting may have caused a significant 
change in synaptic structures.
As TOR is sensitive to amino acid restriction, we considered the possibility that the fasting-
induced block in synaptic compensation in GluRIIA mutants could be due to a reduction in 
postsynaptic TOR activity and the subsequent change in S6K phosphorylation state. To

 address this possibility, we examined the electrophysiological properties of GluRIIA mutant 
larvae that were raised on yeast-restricted food. Interestingly, yeast-restricted food did not 
interfere with the expression of the retrograde synaptic compensation (Figure S2C), while 
having a strong negative effect on S6K phosphorylation (Figure S2D). Furthermore, we used 
a constitutively active transgenic form of S6K (S6KSTDE) (Barcelo and Stewart, 2002) to 
further tease out the TOR-dependent and TOR-independent effect of acute fasting. 
Overexpression of the S6KSTDE transgene in postsynaptic muscles can induce a retrograde 
enhancement in presynaptic release (Penney et al., 2012). Strikingly, six hours of fasting 
caused a profound suppression of S6K-induced synaptic enhancement (Figure S2E). These 
results indicate that the block of retrograde synaptic enhancement cannot be explained solely 
by the inhibition of S6K phosphorylation activity as a result of fasting and an additional 
factor(s) must be at play.
Another well-established effect of nutrient restriction is the transcriptional activation of the 
translational inhibitor, 4E-BP (Demontis and Perrimon, 2010; Owusu-Ansah et al., 2013; 
Teleman et al., 2005). Therefore, we examined 4E-BP transcript levels in larvae using 
quantitative PCR analysis following six hours of fasting. Compared to control larvae, fasting 
larvae (6 hr) showed more than two fold increase in 4E-BP transcript levels (Figure 2F). In 
addition, using an enhancer trap LacZ reporter in the 4E-BP genetic locus (known as thor-
LacZ) (Rodriguez et al., 1996), we monitored the transcriptional activity of 4E-BP in 
postsynaptic muscles. The nuclear accumulation of LacZ in this fly closely resembles the 
pattern and level of 4E-BP transcription in the tissue under study (Demontis and Perrimon, 
2010; Rodriguez et al., 1996). We found that the LacZ signal in muscles doubled after six 
hours of fasting (Figures 2G and 2H). Finally, using western blot analysis, we found a 
significant increase in relative 4E-BP protein level to that of actin in response to acute 
fasting (Figures 2I, 2J, S3A).
These results prompted us to ask whether 4E-BP plays a role in mediating the effect of acute 
fasting on synaptic enhancement at the NMJ. To address this question, we generated double 
mutant combinations of GluRIIA and 4E-BP. We recorded from GluRIIA larvae lacking one 
gene copy of 4E-BP and found that heterozygosity for 4E-BP was sufficient to restore 
normal synaptic enhancement in GluRIIA homozygous mutant larvae regardless of nutrient 
availability (Figures 2K and 2L). Furthermore, acute fasting failed to suppress the increase 
in synaptic transmission in 4E-BP mutants (Figure 2M). These results indicate that 4E-BP is 
indeed critical for mediating the blocking effect of fasting on retrograde synaptic 
enhancement.
Foxo acts cell autonomously in postsynaptic muscles to mediate the effect of fasting
How does acute fasting lead to a transcriptional increase in 4E-BP levels? The 
transcriptional regulation of 4E-BP in response to starvation has been previously reported. 
Forkhead-box-O transcription factor, Foxo, controls the transcription of 4E-BP in response 
to changes in insulin signaling and nutrient availability (Demontis and Perrimon, 2010; 
Junger et al., 2003; Puig et al., 2003; Teleman et al., 2005). We therefore set out to explore 
whether Foxo plays a role in mediating the effect of fasting. Foxo has been the subject of 
previous studies at the Drosophila larval NMJ (Howlett et al., 2008). We took advantage of 
Kauwe et al.

 the UAS/Gal4 system to knock down Foxo in postsynaptic muscles while examining the 
changes in 4E-BP transcription using the Lac-Z enhancer trap 4E-BP fly line. We verified 
that our transgenic RNAi against Foxo was capable of reducing Foxo mRNA in muscles 
significantly (Figure S3C). We found that 4E-BP transcriptional increase in response to 
fasting was largely absent when Foxo was reduced in postsynaptic muscles (Figures 3A and 
3B). These findings indicate that Foxo acts cell-autonomously to enhance postsynaptic 4E-
BP transcription when larvae are nutrient deprived. Therefore, it is plausible that the 
regulation of 4E-BP by Foxo is critical for the effect of acute fasting on retrograde synaptic 
enhancement. Larvae overexpressing a transgenic Foxo-RNAi showed a significant 
reduction in baseline EJC amplitude (MHC control, 21.891 nA ± 1.517; MHC×Foxo-RNAi, 
12.536 nA ± 1.109; n=15, 25; p < 0.001); however, in these larvae retrograde synaptic 
enhancement in response to GluRIIA loss was fully intact after six hours of acute fasting 
(Figures 3C–3E, 3G).
Since postsynaptic knock-down of Foxo in larvae appears to influence baseline synaptic 
transmission, it raises the possibility that the nature of synaptic compensation may have been 
altered in these larvae. To test this, we removed one copy of eIF4E in GluRIIA mutant larvae 
while knocking down Foxo in postsynaptic muscles. We have previously reported that 
heterozygosity of eIF4E has no effect on baseline synaptic transmission (Figure S4B), but 
can effectively block synaptic compensation in GluRIIA mutants (Penney et al., 2012). 
GluRIIA mutant larvae with reduced postsynaptic Foxo showed a similar sensitivity to 
eIF4E: heterozygosity of eIF4E fully blocked synaptic compensation in these larvae (Figures 
3F and 3G). These results together suggest that, while knock down of Foxo reduces baseline 
synaptic release, it does not interfere with synaptic compensation, but rather protects 
synaptic compensation during fasting by preventing the upregulation of 4E-BP transcription.
A postsynaptic combinatorial TOR/S6K and 4E-BP signal regulates presynaptic 
neurotransmitter release
Our previous results have indicated that TOR/S6K-induced retrograde enhancement of 
synaptic strength at the NMJ is highly sensitive to availability of eIF4E (Penney et al., 
2012). At the same time, it is well appreciated that 4E-BP normally inhibits translation by 
sequestering eIF4E, (Ma and Blenis, 2009; Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009). Depending 
on the proportion of 4E-BP that is phosphorylated by TOR under normal conditions, it is 
conceivable that loss of 4E-BP might lead to a significant increase in eIF4E availability. 
Previous work has indicated that eIF4E can accumulate at postsynaptic domains surrounding 
the NMJ (Penney et al., 2012; Sigrist et al., 2000). We took advantage of a GFP::eIF4E 
protein trap line (Quinones-Coello et al., 2007) to examine the accumulation of postsynaptic 
eIF4E in 4E-BP mutants. Our analysis revealed a significant increase in eIF4E accumulation 
at postsynaptic domains based on overlap with postsynaptic density marker Discs large 
(Dlg) (Figures 4A and 4B), suggesting that this increase may be critical for the enhancement 
in QC in 4E-BP mutant larvae. Supporting a critical role for eIF4E, we found that 
heterozygosity for eIF4E was capable of causing a profound suppression of QC increase in 
4E-BP mutants (Figures 4C and 4D).

 While the positive regulation from TOR/S6K and negative input from 4E-BP at the synapse 
appear to converge on eIF4E, it is not clear whether the two regulatory inputs can function 
independently of one another. We therefore set out to test genetic interaction between 4E-BP 
and S6K mutants. Heterozygosity for S6K, which does not affect baseline synaptic 
transmission, can strongly suppress synaptic enhancement in GluRIIA mutants (Penney et 
al., 2012). In contrast, the enhanced synaptic strength in 4E-BP loss of function mutants was 
unaffected by S6K heterozygosity (Figure 4C and 4D). Furthermore, we used an indirect 
approach to evaluate the functional interaction between 4E-BP and TOR by examining 4E-
BP mutant larvae that expressed either a wild type 4E-BP transgene or a TOR-independent 
4E-BP transgene (4E-BPaa) in postsynaptic muscles: a direct comparison of EJCs and QC 
between these two genetic combinations showed a significant difference in the ability of 
these two transgenes to restore synaptic release (Figures 4E). The inability of 4E-BPaa 
transgene to fully restore synaptic function to baseline was also observed when we 
conducted the rescue experiment using an additional muscle driver (Figure S4A). Finally, we 
tested the effect of muscle overexpression of 4E-BP and 4E-BPaa transgenes in wild-type 
larval muscles and found no detectable change in synaptic transmission (Figure S4B). These 
results together indicate that under normal conditions, the negative input from 4E-BP is 
partially counteracted by TOR-dependent phosphorylation of 4E-BP, as such in the absence 
of this phosphorylation presynaptic release is reduced. Therefore, from our results we 
conclude that the balance between positive input from TOR and negative input from 4E-BP 
is critical for adjusting presynaptic release at the NMJ.
DISCUSSION
Acute fasting regulates retrograde synaptic enhancement
Here we show that a few hours of fasting can have a strong impact on retrograde synaptic 
enhancement at the Drosophila larval NMJ. Removal of food source acutely activates 4E-BP 
transcription in postsynaptic muscles in a Foxo-dependent manner, thereby leading to the 
inhibition of retrograde synaptic enhancement at the NMJ. Our results indicate that Foxo 
and 4E-BP act cell-autonomously in postsynaptic muscles to exert a retrograde negative 
regulation on presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Future studies are needed to test whether 
fasting-induced alterations in insulin signaling underlie the transcriptional upregulation of 
4E-BP via its effect on Foxo in postsynaptic muscles.
While 4E-BP mediated suppression of synaptic enhancement as a result of fasting could be 
considered undesirable during development, it can be beneficial under conditions of 
abnormally high synaptic activity. As such, 4E-BP mediated inhibition of retrograde 
synaptic enhancement and the subsequent dampening of circuit activity might provide an 
explanation for the beneficial effects of fasting in reducing seizures in some cases (Bailey et 
al., 2005; Neal et al., 2008; Yuen and Sander, 2014). Similarly, in cases where dysregulation 
of TOR activity is thought to underlie abnormal circuit activity, such as in TSC models 
(Bateup et al., 2013), intermittent fasting could potentially dampen the increase in synaptic 
release through a 4E-BP dependent inhibition, thereby stabilizing neuronal circuits.

 Retrograde regulation of synaptic strength: a dynamic duel between TOR and 4E-BP
In addition to its role as a molecular responder to stress, 4E-BP exerts a constitutive negative 
regulation on presynaptic neurotransmitter release at the NMJ. Our electrophysiological 
analysis of loss-of-function mutant larvae indicates that 4E-BP functions in postsynaptic 
muscles to constitutively provide a retrograde negative influence on synaptic strength. In 
light of our findings, we propose a two-pronged scheme for the retrograde regulation of 
synaptic strength at the NMJ (Figure S4C). On the one hand, a positive input from TOR is 
mediated through S6K/eIF4A and eIF4E to enhance postsynaptic translation. Synaptic 
compensation in GluRIIA mutant larva appears to rely mostly on this axis as evidenced by 
strong sensitivity to S6K heterozygosity and no change in the proportion of phosphorylated 
4E-BP vs non-phosphorylated 4E-BP levels (Figure S3B). Opposing this positive input, 4E-
BP inhibits translation by sequestering eIF4E and adjusting the degree of retrograde 
compensation. Indeed, loss of 4E-BP leads to a strong increase in QC that is highly sensitive 
to eIF4E heterozygosity but not sensitive to S6K heterozygosity. The balance between these 
two forces reveals itself also when 4E-BP loss-of-function mutants are rescued by a non-
phosphorylatable 4E-BP transgene. In this combination TOR can no longer inhibit 4E-BP, 
and we find that the presynaptic neurotransmitter release is lower than wild type, similarly to 
what is observed in TOR hypomorphic mutants (Penney et al., 2012). We propose a working 
model in which the negative force of 4E-BP is under constant check via phosphorylation by 
TOR, and the positive input from TOR/S6K is constitutively countered by 4E-BP’s ability to 
sequester eIF4E, a dynamic duel that ensures a tight regulation of synaptic strength.
