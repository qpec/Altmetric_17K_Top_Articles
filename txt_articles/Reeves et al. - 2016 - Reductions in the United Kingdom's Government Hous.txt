Housing security is an important determinant of mental ill health. We used a quasinatural experiment to evaluate this
association, comparing the prevalence of mental ill health in the United Kingdom before and after the government’s
April 2011 reduction in financial support for low-income persons who rent private-sector housing (mean reduction of
approximately £1,220 ($2,315) per year). Datacame from the United Kingdom’s Annual Population Survey, a repeated
quarterly cross-sectional survey. We focused our analysis on renters in the private sector, disaggregating data be-
tween an intervention group receiving the government’s Housing Benefit (n = 36,859) and a control group not receiving
the Housing Benefit (n = 142,205). The main outcome was a binary measure of self-reported mental health problems.
After controlling for preexisting time trends, we observed that between April 2011 and March 2013, the prevalence of
depressive symptoms among private renters receiving the Housing Benefit increased by 1.8 percentage points (95%
confidence interval: 1.0, 2.7) compared with those not receiving the Housing Benefit. Our models estimated that
approximately 26,000 (95% confidence interval: 14,000, 38,000) people newly experienced depressive symptoms
in association with the cuts to the Housing Benefit. We conclude that reducing housing support to low-income persons
in the private rental sector increased the prevalence of depressive symptoms in the United Kingdom.

Housing provides shelter and security, protecting health
and well-being; but when that security becomes uncertain,
health (mental health in particular) is undermined. There is
a large body of evidence documenting how difficulties in ob-
taining affording housing are associated with greater risks of
depression (1–3), anxiety (4, 5), weight gain (6), visits to gen-
eral practitioners (7), and suicide (8). However, whether the
association between unaffordable housing and mental ill
health is causal remains unclear (1, 9). Previous studies ex-
amining this relationship have been criticized for failing to
address potential confounding (such as preexisting mental
health or substance use problems) and have not identified
why some households suddenly begin struggling to keep
up with existing housing commitments. Housing may be-
come unaffordable because of rising costs, such as increases
in mortgage interest rates or rent, or because of a reduction in
income, potentially through job loss, divorce, or welfare re-
ductions (10). Earlier work has been unable to disentangle
these drivers of unaffordable housing, which may, in turn, af-
fect health to differing degrees.
To examine this question, we took advantage of a “natural
policy experiment” that occurred when the United King-
dom’s 2010–2015 Coalition government reduced incomes
among low-wage renters by implementing large cuts to the
Local Housing Allowance (LHA), a program which provides
funds for tenants who rent housing in the private sector. Start-
ing in 2010, the Coalition government embarked on a major
austerity program, with the stated goal of reducing the na-
tion’s budget deficit. While much of the discussion of this

 policy has been dominated by macroeconomic consider-
ations, public health professionals have argued that these pol-
icies will damage health (11–13).
Reductions in the Housing Benefit (HB) made one of the
largest single contributions to the overall cut in spending
(14). After pensions, the HB is the single largest welfare ex-
penditure in the United Kingdom, costing the government ap-
proximately £24 billion ($31 billion) every year (14). Starting
in April 2011, the Coalition government reduced funding for
the LHA by £1.6 billion ($2.1 billion) (15–17). This did 2
things. First, it reduced the payment from the median value
of local market rent to the 30th percentile. Second, it capped
the amount of money households could receive at £250
($326) per week for 1 bedroom, £290 ($378) per week for
2 bedrooms, £340 ($443) per week for 3 bedrooms, and
£400 ($522) per week for 4 or more bedrooms. These policies
were applied to both new and existing LHA claimants, from
the anniversary date of their claim. The Institute for Fiscal
Studies estimated that the average loss of income for recipi-
ents was £1,220 ($2,315) per year, affecting about 1.35 mil-
lion individuals and potentially tipping 27,000–54,000
children into severe poverty (18).
This policy intervention, which was outside the control of
academic researchers, created a “natural experiment.” Natural
experiments are exogenous changes occurring in everyday
life that assign people to either an intervention group or a con-
trol group through a process which is random or approxi-
mately random, such as winning the lottery or the timing of
a policy intervention (19–21). The changes in the LHA there-
fore created a natural policy experiment among private rent-
ers, reducing incomes among those receiving the HB after
April 2011 but not among renters in the private sector who
were not receiving support from the state (22). The Medical
Research Council recommends the use of these study designs
for inferring causality with respect to population health inter-
ventions, reflecting the cost, ethical challenges, and practical
difficulty of undertaking randomized controlled trials (23,
24). Natural experiments are able to address some of the
problems that plague observational studies, on which most
of the existing evidence relies (25, 26). Observational studies
often lack a well-specified counterfactual condition (i.e.,
what would have occurred in the absence of an intervention)
and are frequently subject to unmeasured confounding (26).
Well-conducted randomized controlled trials are the prefera-
ble way to establish causality, but there has been conceptual
or financial reluctance to use them to evaluate large-scale pol-
icies designed to influence the social determinants of health
(27). This natural experiment enabled us to address the limi-
tations of both observational studies and randomized con-
trolled trials and therefore estimate the causal relationships
between reductions in income, unaffordable housing, and
mental ill health.
The health effects of HB reductions are likely to vary across
local authorities and will be particularly large in urban areas,
where rents are high and where the proportion of HB recipients
is large (15). For example, the April 2011 changes reduced the
level of financial support by 10% in some parts of Wales but
by as much as 50% in some parts of London, where housing
costs are much higher. More deprived areas are also likely to be
hit harder, as they have a greater proportion of HB recipients.
Here, we tested the association between a reduction in in-
come and mental health by examining changes in the HB,
using a control group of persons who were living in privately
rented housing but not receiving the HB and an intervention
group of otherwise similar individuals who were receiving the
HB. We also explored whether the impact of these reductions in
the HB was larger in areas hardest hit by this policy change.
METHODS
Data
The Annual Population Survey (APS) is a nationally repre-
sentative, repeated cross-sectional survey of approximately
320,000 individuals conducted annually in the United King-
dom between April and the following March (e.g., April
2010 to March 2011) (28). The APS integrates the Labour
Force Survey (waves 1 and 5), the English Local Labour
Force Survey, the Welsh Labour Force Survey, and the Scottish
Labour Force Survey. These data generate quarterly official sta-
tistics, so each quarter is intended to be nationally representa-
tive. Details on the survey have been provided elsewhere (28).
Briefly, 16,640 households are randomly selected from the
“small users” postcode address file. To ensure that no particular
household is interviewed too frequently (thus overburdening
that household), a “used address file” is maintained, and any
address sampled will not be sampled again during the subse-
quent 2 years. Data are collected through face-to-face inter-
views. Data were drawn from April 2009 to March 2013,
thereby including data from 4 full waves of the survey. These
data allowed us to observe mental health at baseline during the
preintervention period and then to observe the level of mental
ill health after the policy change was made in April 2011. Our
analysis focused on persons aged 16–69 years who were then
renting housing in the private sector (n = 179,037).
Mental health outcomes
Health is assessed in the APS by asking respondents what
health problems they currently have. The list can include phys-
ical problems or disabilities connected with the arms, legs, or
back. We were principally interested in those people who self-
reported “depression, bad nerves, oranxiety” (see the Web Ap-
pendix, available at http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/).
Respondents are also asked whether they receive any state
benefits, and we recorded whether they self-reported being a
recipient of the HB. We also created indicators capturing
whether recipients claimed the job-seeker’s allowance (unem-
ployment insurance) or—as a sensitivity test—whether they
received child tax credits (means-tested financial support for
primary caregivers). The APS also collects data on a series
of sociodemographic characteristics, including age, sex, gov-
ernment office region (a geographical indicator), ethnicity,
number of dependent children, marital status, earnings, em-
ployment status, occupation (in detailed occupational catego-
ries), education, and disability status.

 also renting in the private sector but were receiving the HB
(24, 25). We followed these 2 groups before and after the
HB policy change was implemented in April 2011, compar-
ing the period April 2009–March 2011 with the period April
2011–March 2013. One key assumption was that assignment
to the intervention group should have been random or “as if”
random. In this study, we assumed that collection of the APS
data was not causally related to the policy change (i.e., who
was sampled and when they were sampled) (21). Proceeding
from this assumption, we argue that those surveyed prior to
the April 2011 reform comprised one nationally representa-
tive sample (n = 85,090) and those surveyed after the April
2011 reform comprised another nationally representative
sample (n = 93,974). The only substantive difference be-
tween these 2 samples should have been the policy change
related to the private rental sector.

 To test this assumption, we used a series of balance tests
which sought to establish whether the pre–policy change
and post–policy change samples were similar across a range
of sociodemographic characteristics (Table 1) (22). We exam-
ined whether the intervention was random with respect to the
sample—that is, whether the policy change was an exogenous
change. There were significant (P < 0.05) differences for age,
ethnicity, number of job-seeker’s allowance claimants, gross
weekly earnings, employment status, education, disability,
and the proportion of the sample who were claiming the HB,
but in each case the difference was not substantially important.
For example, the proportion of the sample who reported being
nonwhite British was 1 percentage point higher in the postin-
tervention sample.
To estimate the effect of the policy change on mental
health, we used difference-in-differences models, which
measured the change in mental health over time in both the
intervention group and the control group (19). One strength
of this econometric technique is that it mimics an experimen-
tal research design using observational data by estimating the
effect of an intervention on an outcome by comparing the av-
erage change in the intervention group with the average
change in the nonintervention group. Ideally, repeated obser-
vations would be measured within the same individuals over
time, but this technique is widely used with repeated cross-
sectional data (19).

Depression is a measure of the average level of self-reported
depressive symptoms and similar mental health problems.
The subscript “Post” refers to those people interviewed
after the policy change in April 2011, and the subscript
“Pre” refers to those interviewed before the policy change.
The subscript “HB” indicates persons who are recipients of
the HB, and the subscript “non-HB” indicates those who
are not recipients of the HB. The intervention effect is our co-
efficient of interest and is the difference between these 2 ob-
served effects for recipients and nonrecipients, yielding the
main difference-in-differences estimator (19). We fitted our
models using a linear probability model with robust standard
errors to avoid some of the problems associated with logistic
and probit regression models; but as a sensitivity test, we en-
sured that our results were consistent when assuming this al-
ternative functional form (29).
To further check the sensitivity of our findings to our
model specification, we also fitted these models using inter-
rupted time-series analysis and used matching methods to
observe whether our results were consistent across specifica-
tions (25, 30).

 symptoms among HB recipients (0.028 percentage points;
95% confidence interval (CI): 0.019, 0.035). In contrast, per-
sons who were not receiving the HB (the “control group”) ex-
perienced only a slight, albeit also significant, increase in the
probability of self-reported symptoms of depression (0.0083
percentage points; 95% CI: 0.0062, 0.010). This resulted in
an inequality in their trends of 1.8 percentage points (95%
CI: 0.010, 0.027) (Figure 1).
Some areas of the country were hit harder by the changes
than others (15, 18). Drawing on simulations of the effects of
this change in the HB, we would expect these reforms to in-
crease financial strain more dramatically in the most expen-
sive housing markets, such as Inner London, the South
East, and other major urban areas. We calculated separate dif-
ference-in-differences estimates for persons living in high-
and low-impact areas. We found that the increase in depres-
sive symptoms was greater among private renters receiving
the HB in high-impact areas than among HB recipients in
low-impact areas (Figure 2). However, even in these low-
impact areas, the prevalence of depressive symptoms rose ap-
proximately 1 percentage point more than for private renters
who were not receiving the HB.
Alternative estimates of the influence of welfare reform on
mental health
To ensure that our results were not solely due to our mod-
eling strategy, we also estimated the influence of this policy
intervention on mental ill health using interrupted time-series
analysis (25). To do this, we calculated the prevalence of self-
reported depressive symptoms for each quarter among people
in the private rental sector who did and did not receive the
HB. Then we estimated whether there was a break in the ag-
gregate trend around April 2011 for persons receiving the HB
compared with those who were not receiving the HB. This
form of analysis allowed us to test whether the parallel trends
assumption held (i.e., the trajectories for the intervention and
control groups would have been the same in the absence of
the policy change) (19). Consistent with the difference-in-
differences models, we found that there was a clear break
in the data around April 2011 for persons receiving the HB
over and above any change seen among those who were
not receiving the HB (Figure 3; Web Table 1). In addition,
we found that the trends for both groups before the interven-
tion were parallel and that there was no clear break in the con-
trol group after the policy change, which supports the parallel
trends assumption. We also found no evidence that the

 influence of the reform diminished over time, indicating that
the health effects of increasing financial strain among recip-
ients of the HB did not attenuate quickly as people adjusted to
this new reality.
Finally, because people receiving the HB differ in impor-
tant ways from those not receiving the HB, we implemented a
matching procedure (using coarsened exact matching) to bal-
ance the sample across a range of attributes, except (impor-
tantly) whether respondents received the HB (30, 31). We
matched on the following covariates: age, sex, employment
status, geographical region, ethnicity, number of dependent
children in the household under the age of 19 years, income,
occupation, education, whether the respondent was a job-
seeker’s allowance claimant, and the date of interview (see
Web Table 2 for more details on the adequacy of the matching
procedure). We found that even after matching, the change in
the prevalence of depressive symptoms among HB recipients
remained larger than the change among private renters who
were not HB recipients, even though the estimated effect
was attenuated slightly (Table 3).
Robustness tests
We performed a series of robustness checks. First, we con-
ducted 2 so-called “falsification tests,” which checked the
specificity of our findings. In one test, we examined whether
symptoms of depression changed among HB recipients living
in local authority (government-owned) housing, who would

 not have been affected by adjustments to the private sector
housing allowance (n = 76,467) (32); we found that there
was no discernible effect in this group (Table 4). In a further
test, we assessed physical health outcomes that would not
plausibly change in the short term, such as “difficulty in hear-
ing” or a “speech impediment” (Web Appendix). As expected,
no relationship was observed (Table 5), further corroborating
the clinical relevance of our observations.
In the APS, there is also an alternative measure of mental
health problems which includes “phobias” and “panic at-
tacks.” We included these people in our main “depression” de-
pendent variable to see whether our results changed, finding
that they did not (Web Table 3). Next, we tested whether re-
ductions to child tax credits, which also began around April
2011, might have influenced our results. We found that includ-
ing this additional policy change in the model did not qualita-
tively alter our findings (Web Table 4). We also removed
people from the sample who had had preexisting mental health
problems for over 1 year (n = 911), as well as those who had
any health problem (n = 6,289). As shown in Web Table 5,
none of the results changed. This further supports the conclu-
sion that the change in prevalence corresponded to new cases
of depressive symptoms (Web Table 5).
Although there was a “used address file,” it is possible that
the same individuals were sampled twice. Therefore, we also
removed any duplicate observations for which the same indi-
vidual may have been sampled twice in 2 different periods,
finding that our results remained unchanged (Web Table 6).
We compared the influence of the April 2011 reforms in the
HB with the whole sample (i.e., we compared people receiv-
ing the HB in the private rental sector with everyone else in
the data set) and found that our results did not qualitatively
change (Web Table 7). Respondents who report depressive
symptoms are highly likely to report being disabled. We
therefore adjusted our models for disability status and ob-
served that our results remained consistent across these mod-
els (Web Table 8). We also estimated our main associations
using a logistic regression model and found similar results
(Web Figure 1).
DISCUSSION
The reforms made to the LHA in 2011 created a natural ex-
periment which reduced financial support for one group in the
private rental sector (renters who received the HB) but not oth-
ers (renters who did not receive the HB). Using difference-
in-differences models, interrupted time-series analysis, and
matching methods, we consistently found that the April
2011 reforms to the HB increased the risk of depressive symp-
toms among persons claiming the HB by approximately 1.8
percentage points above the risk in private renters not claiming
the benefit. In short, our results indicate that a reduction in
household income (which reduced the level of housing afford-
ability) harmed mental health. This rise in mental ill health was
not only a short-term shock; the increase in depressive symp-
toms remained elevated for up to 24 months after the reform
(see Figure 3). In addition, the rise in symptoms of depression
among persons in the private rental sector was concentrated in
those regions of the United Kingdom hit hardest by the re-
forms, such as Inner London and Tyne and Wear.
To put this rise in perspective, in March 2010—just before
the reform—there were 1.5 million people receiving the HB
in the private rental sector. Approximately 20% of these peo-
ple were experiencing depression. After the reform, preva-
lence of this self-reported measure of poor mental health
rose by 1.8 percentage points—roughly a 10% increase. Ac-
cording to our models, approximately 26,000 (95% confi-
dence interval: 14,000, 38,000) additional HB recipients
reported symptoms of depression after these reforms to the
HB occurred.
Our study had several limitations. First, we used repeated
cross-sectional survey data, so it is not entirely clear whether
those who reported symptoms of depression after the 2011
reform were new claimants or existing claimants. However,
our results indicate that the characteristics of the sample
were very similar before and after the intervention, suggest-
ing that compositional changes do not explain these findings.
Further, these findings are consistent with longitudinal qual-
itative data collected on those experiencing the reforms (33).
Second, we cannot know what would have happened to the
level of depressive symptoms in the intervention group if
the reform had not been implemented. To address this, we ex-
amined the parallel trends assumption and observed that the
trajectories of depressive symptoms among the intervention
and control groups were parallel before April 2011, suggest-
ing that, in the absence of the intervention, these trends would
have continued to be parallel (25). Third, other policy
changes which may have influenced mental health were oc-
curring during this same period, such as changes to child tax
credits. Even when we adjusted for these policy changes we
found that our results remained consistent, suggesting that
these findings are not explained by other policy reforms.
Fourth, it is possible that HB recipients may have stated
that they were not receiving the HB because they were embar-
rassed to admit they were claiming state support, thereby po-
tentially biasing our results. However, such underreporting
would have led to conservative estimates, because those
most at risk of experiencing depressive symptoms following
April 2011 were now included in the control group, narrow-
ing the gap between the intervention and control groups.
Fifth, the timing of the April 2011 changes in the LHA may
not have been “as if” random, because people in the interven-
tion group were aware of the policy change and may have ad-
justed their behavior beforehand, potentially undermining our
ability to detect an effect. This suggests that our estimates of
the causal effect of reduced income on the affordability of
housing and mental health are likely to be conservative.
Sixth, people in the private rental sector may also be experi-
encing poorer mental health because they are struggling to ob-
tain a mortgage, something that would have been a more
realistic prospect 20 years ago. The impact of the changing
prospects of housing ownership on mental health requires de-
tailed further study, but is unlikely to have affected our results
because those prospects were relatively stable across this pe-
riod. Seventh, our measure of depressive symptoms was a self-
report measure, and although self-reporting is correlated with
clinical assessments, it is not itself a diagnostic tool. It may
therefore have biased our results, particularly among men,
who may be less likely to report symptoms of depression in
this survey setting, creating conservative biases (34).

 These results have important policy implications. First,
they highlight the health effects of welfare reform on eco-
nomically vulnerable groups (35). These changes to the pri-
vate rental sector have reduced financial support for these
groups, increasing the precariousness of their housing situa-
tions and exposing them to greater insecurity and potentially
homelessness (36). Second, these reforms to the LHA (by in-
creasing the level of depressive symptoms among recipients
of the HB) potentially counteract policy initiatives in other
areas that were designed to reduce reliance on disability ben-
efits by reducing the generosity of incapacity benefits. In the
future, policy-makers should attend more carefully to the
spillover effects of policy interventions that are implemented
simultaneously. Similarly, the costs incurred in treating per-
sons whose mental health has deteriorated may offset any po-
tential savings resulting from cutting the HB. Third, as part of
the July 2015 budget, the Conservative government outlined
plans to remove eligibility for the HB from youths aged 18–
21 years. Our results suggest that this policy change, if imple-
mented as scheduled in 2017, will increase the riskof depressive
symptoms in this age group even further, potentially harming
their chances in the labor market and having a long-term scar-
ring effect on their health.
