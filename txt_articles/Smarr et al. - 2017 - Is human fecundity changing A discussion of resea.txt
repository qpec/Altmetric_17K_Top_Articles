ABSTRACT: Fecundity, the biologic capacity to reproduce, is essential for the health of individuals and is, therefore, fundamental for under-
standing human health at the population level. Given the absence of a population (bio)marker, fecundity is assessed indirectly by various
individual-based (e.g. semen quality, ovulation) or couple-based (e.g. time-to-pregnancy) endpoints. Population monitoring of fecundity is
challenging, and often defaults to relying on rates of births (fertility) or adverse outcomes such as genitourinary malformations and reproduct-
ive site cancers. In light of reported declines in semen quality and fertility rates in some global regions among other changes, the question as
to whether human fecundity is changing needs investigation. We review existing data and novel methodological approaches aimed at answer-
ing this question from a transdisciplinary perspective. The existing literature is insufficient for answering this question; we provide an overview
of currently available resources and novel methods suitable for delineating temporal patterns in human fecundity in future research.
Key words: epidemiology / fecundity / fertility / gynecologic diseases / time-to-pregnancy / urologic diseases
Introduction
The question of whether human fecundity is changing elicits polarized
views regarding the interpretation of available data. Because it is nearly
impossible to distinguish whether fewer births reflect reduced fecund-
ity (i.e. the biological capacity to reproduce) or changing reproductive
behavior (e.g. contraception, delayed childbearing), some authors
have concluded that the question is not answerable (Sallmén et al.,

 2005). Still, there are salient reasons to address this issue given that
reduced fecundity has profound psychological and financial costs for
individual couples. Furthermore, a growing body of evidence suggests
that both fecundity and fertility are markers of somatic health and lon-
gevity, including higher risks of reproductive and non-reproductive
cancers (Jacobsen et al., 2000; Brinton et al., 2005; Walsh et al., 2010;
Eisenberg et al., 2015; Hanson et al., 2016), cardiovascular disease
(Eisenberg et al., 2015) and mortality for men and women (Jensen
et al., 2009; Eisenberg et al., 2014), prompting calls for their potential
use in health screening (Omu, 2013; Ventimiglia et al., 2015).
Moreover, such findings have implications for previously described
research paradigms that assess the role of fecundity in the pathway to
later onset diseases, as conceptualized in the testicular dysgenesis syn-
drome (Skakkebaek et al., 2001) and ovarian dysgenesis syndrome
(Buck Louis et al., 2011).
On 20–21 September 2015, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development convened a work-
shop entitled: ‘Is human fecundity changing?’ at which an invited trans-
disciplinary group of scientists discussed the available weight of
evidence. Participants represented the fields of demography, social sci-
ence, population health science, epidemiology and medicine (i.e. gyne-
cology, reproductive endocrinology, urology and family medicine).
Other workshop goals were to examine research barriers and identify
ways forward for human fecundity research. Further details about the
workshop are found elsewhere https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/
meetings/2015/Pages/091015.aspx.
This paper discusses the data reviewed during the workshop in the
context of important methodologic considerations. Possible strategies
for future population-based research are presented, from the most
basic to the most sophisticated. We have organized the paper as four
questions and concluding remarks.
Discussion
What are the distinctions between human
fecundity and fertility?
Recognizing that there are many operational definitions of human
fecundity, from a population research perspective, fecundity is defined
as the biologic capacity to reproduce irrespective of pregnancy inten-
tions, while fertility is demonstrated fecundity as measured by live
births and sometimes stillbirths. Terminology may become confusing
in the context of impaired fecundity, which includes women who con-
ceive but are unable to carry a pregnancy to delivery (pregnancy loss)
and couples unable to conceive within 6 months (conception delay) or
12 months (infertility) of trying. Couples’ fecundity is dynamic in that
either partner could experience difficulties at any trying attempt, which
resolves spontaneously, following treatment, after a change in partner,
or may remain unresolved. This observation reflects the importance of
behavior and environmental influences on underlying biology, as well
as the couple-dependent nature of fecundity. In contrast to fertility,
which is easily measured by births, fecundity cannot be directly mea-
sured at the population level and requires reliance on proxy measures.
Examples of commonly utilized measures to assess fecundity in women
include hormonal profiles, menstruation and ovulation, and biomar-
kers of follicular reserve such as anti-Müllerian hormone (Steiner,
2013). In men, fecundity can be assessed based on semen quality,
clinical measures of testicular volumes and hormonal profiles (Olsen
and Ramlau-Hansen, 2014). Couple fecundability is measured by the
number of calendar months or menstrual cycles required to become
pregnant; the underlying premise being that a shorter time-to-
pregnancy (TTP) is indicative of higher fecundity.
What is the weight of evidence for temporal
patterns in human fecundity?
To answer this question, it is important to empirically weigh the data
on temporal patterns of male, female and couple fecundity. Fecundity
research has largely focused on the male, possibly given the availability
of non-invasive and quantifiable markers, via semen analysis, from the
general population (Jørgensen et al., 2012) along with men from a
range of population subgroups (e.g. semen donors, men attending
infertility clinics and military recruits) (Swan et al., 2003; Le Moal et al.,
2015). Heterogeneity in study populations and designs may explain the
equivocal results aimed at answering questions on declining semen
quality. However, there are other indicators of male fecundity such as
worldwide increases in the incidence of testicular cancer (Znaor et al.,
2014; Trabert et al., 2015) or increasing rates in genitourinary malfor-
mations (Paulozzi, 1999) that suggest fecundity is declining.
Some indication of changes in the length of time women is at risk of
pregnancy can be extrapolated from data on temporal patterns in the
age at menarche and onset of natural menopause. Most of the literature
reports a decline in age at menarche (Parent et al., 2003) and an
increase in age at natural menopause (Gold, 2011) resulting in a longer
interval of presumed fecundity. Additionally, female reproductive can-
cers may inform our understanding of changing female fecundity, given
evidence of increasing ovarian cancer incidence in European countries
(Bray et al., 2005). Overall, however, there is a dearth of information
focusing on temporal trends of female fecundity, and similarly so for
couple fecundity. Of the few studies to assess time trends in couple
fecundity, it was concluded that couple fecundity was improving, as indi-
cated by a shorter TTP or increased odds of couple fecundity across
birth cohorts for a 32-year period for the British population (Joffe,
2000), as well as the decreasing proportion of subfertile women across
birth cohorts for a 20-year period in Sweden (Scheike et al., 2008).
Most data used to assess fecundity trends more broadly come from
research focusing on (inter)national fertility/infertility rates and there
is a general consensus that fertility is declining, as evident by total fertil-
ity rates now below two births per woman for most of Europe and
North America (Skakkebaek et al., 2016). Still, limited available data
sources, measurement issues (e.g. populations assessed—immigrant,
etc.), research design constraints (e.g. retrospective sampling, biomar-
kers in population-based studies), and the inability to disentangle soci-
etal and behavioral factors (e.g. contraception use, abortion rates,
pregnancy intentions) when such multilevel data are unavailable, pre-
clude our ability to use temporal changes in fertility rates to directly
answer the question of whether human fecundity is indeed changing.
What data and research methods exist to
assess fecundity trends?
Adequate evaluation of temporal patterns of human fecundity requires
available data and appropriate study design and statistical methods.
Currently, the most commonly used data resources include registries
of fertility/infertility treatment, live births, reproductive cancers and
500

 genitourinary malformations, and nationally representative surveys of
reproductive health (Table I). Limitations of these sources include fac-
tors such as the lack of data on changes in diagnostic methods over
time, possible surveillance bias and limited information on relevant cov-
ariates. Still, some perspective is gleaned from cross-sectional surveys
that are repeated over time, like the National Survey of Family Growth
(NSFG). The NSFG provides data on the prevalence of infertility,
impaired fecundity and factors that may impact fertility and fecundity
measures, such as pregnancy intentions in the USA (Chandra et al.,
2013). Unfortunately, current data resources may not adequately iden-
tify populations at risk for inclusion in population-based assessments of
fecundity and have been particularly concentrated in Europe and the
USA (e.g. National ART Surveillance System (NASS), ESHRE), empha-
sizing the need to capture data more globally.

Human fecundity

 Cross-sectional study designs offer another potential approach for
estimating fecundity. Several authors have retrospectively queried
women about the time required to become pregnant, and such data
may be cautiously compared over time to estimate patterns of fecund-
ity given that this design excludes couples who have never been preg-
nant, potentially excluding the most infertile couples (Joffe, 2000;
Jensen et al., 2005; Scheike et al., 2008). Furthermore, the validity of
this approach assumes that individuals can accurately recall such infor-
mation. However, few studies have empirically evaluated recalled TTP
validity, with conflicting reports of reliability irrespective of the period
of recall (i.e. short and long term) (Zielhuis et al., 1992; Cooney et al.,
2009; Radin et al., 2015; Jukic et al., 2016). Couple fecundity has also
been estimated in cross-sectional designs using the current duration
approach, which assesses that the length of time couples has been at
risk for pregnancy (i.e. having intercourse but not using contraception)
irrespective of pregnancy intentions (Keiding et al., 2002; Slama et al.,
2006; Thoma et al., 2013). An advantage of this design is that it can
include couples who have never been pregnant when estimating TTP.
While, initially, less fecund couples are overrepresented in the current
duration approach, this ensuing bias is corrected for in the analysis
stage (Zelen, 2004).
Prospective cohort studies with preconception enrollment of cou-
ples have the ability to measure TTP and examine multiple reproduct-
ive outcomes, such as menstrual and ovulatory patterns, pregnancy
loss and semen quality. To date, relatively few such studies have been
conducted and it is unlikely that many new cohorts will be established
and systematically maintained in large populations over time. This data
gap likely reflects the challenges in establishing such cohorts, while also
stimulating novel approaches such as Internet-based recruitment
cohorts (Huybrechts et al., 2010; Wise et al., 2015).
While beyond the scope of this paper, a number of analytic,
model-based approaches are available to incorporate timing and fre-
quency of intercourse, ovulation proxies (e.g. hormonal profiles,
changes in cervical mucus) and couples’ behaviors or lifestyles
(Stanford and Dunson, 2007; Kim et al., 2010, 2012; Sundaram et al.,
2012; Lum et al., 2015, 2016). Such advances in analytic strategies,
including ‘big data’ approaches to pool data cohorts while handling
variation stemming from study design and data collection methods
(Chatterjee et al., 2016), will help to move forward fecundity
research at the population level.
How can we answer the question—is human
fecundity changing?
Despite the methodologic challenges, many suggestions for designing
research to answer this question from a transdisciplinary perspective
were offered at the workshop, as listed below. These themes are cate-
gorized as critical data gaps and suggestions for moving forward.
Existing critical data gaps:
• Few data on the spectrum of endpoints comprising male and female
fecundity over time needed for assessing temporal patterns; even
fewer global data.
• Few data on couple fecundity, reflective of the need for recruitment
of couples rather than individual partners.
• Limited fecundity research that also has data on behaviors, and
social and cultural factors needed for assessing pregnancy intentions
across diverse global populations.
• Few population-based data linking fecundity and fertility with health
across the lifespan.
Suggestions for moving forward:
• Increase awareness of existing resources for addressing this ques-
tion, while improving access to underutilized resources.
• Leverage population-based surveys, health care data (e.g. electronic
health records), birth registries or other surveys that query partici-
pants about reproductive health, pregnancy intentions, time at risk
of pregnancy, fertility treatments used and childbearing to assess
trends in fecundity and related impairments.
• Develop novel sampling frameworks, ranging from traditional prob-
ability sampling to untargeted approaches using social media and
crowdsourcing methods, for designing and conducting research.
• Extend mobile health technologies tailored for reproductive aged
populations to capture measures of fecundity, behavior and
lifestyle.
• Evaluate big data methods that combine historical data and newly
conducted prospective studies to examine time trends and to evalu-
ate individual-level risk factors.
• Develop study design and analytic methods to correct for biases
introduced by study design, pregnancy intentions, length of time
already trying for pregnancy or censoring due to ART.
• Develop/improve standardized questionnaires that reliably capture
time trying and ‘at risk’ for pregnancy.
• Develop biomarkers of male, female and couple fecundity suitable
for population-based assessment.
Concluding remarks
At present, we are unable to definitively answer the question as to
whether human fecundity is changing, though we recognize the ques-
tion is an answerable one. An initial step is to utilize and build on exist-
ing resources that can address critical data gaps. The complexity of
human fecundity, involving both biology and behavior, underscores the
need for transdisciplinary collaboration in addressing these issues going
forward. Should future research findings point to temporal declines in
human fecundity, delineating the potential causes is critical if we are to
optimize the health of populations worldwide.
