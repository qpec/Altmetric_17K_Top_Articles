Summary
Immune checkpoint inhibitors significantly improve clinical outcomes in numerous malignancies, 
but high-grade immune-related adverse events can occur, particularly with combination 
immunotherapy. Herein, we report two melanoma patients who developed fatal myocarditis 
following treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab. Both patients developed myositis with 
rhabdomyolysis, early progressive and refractory cardiac electrical instability, and myocarditis 
with robust T-cell and macrophage infiltrates. Selective clonal T-cell populations infiltrating the 
myocardium were identical to those present in tumor and skeletal muscle. Pharmacovigilance data 
revealed that myocarditis occurred in 0.27% of patients treated with ipilimumab/nivolumab, 
suggesting this is a rare, potentially fatal, T-cell-driven drug reaction.

Introduction
Immune checkpoint inhibitors have transformed the treatment of several malignancies by 
releasing restrained anti-tumor immune responses.1 Ipilimumab, an anti-cytotoxic T-
lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) antibody, and nivolumab, an anti-programmed 
death-1 (PD-1) antibody have individually improved survival in patients with melanoma, and 
early results suggest that the combination further enhances anti-tumor activity and 
survival.2–5 Common side effects of these agents include dermatitis, endocrinopathies, 
colitis, hepatitis, and pneumonitis, all thought to arise from aberrant activation of 
autoreactive T cells.6,7 These toxicities are more frequent and severe with combination 
ipilimumab and nivolumab.4 Here we report two cases of lethal myocarditis accompanied by 
myositis in patients treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab.
Case Reports
Case 1
A 65-year-old woman (Patient 1) with metastatic melanoma was admitted to the hospital 
with atypical chest pain, dyspnea and fatigue 12 days after receiving her first dose of 
nivolumab (1 mg/kg) and ipilimumab (3 mg/kg). Initial work-up revealed myocarditis and 
myositis with rhabdomyolysis (CPK 17,720 unit/L [normal range 29–168], CK-MB >600 
ng/mL [normal <5.99], troponin I 4.7 increasing to 51.3 ng/mL [normal <0.03]). 
Electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated PR prolongation with normal QRS complexes

 without evidence of ischemia. Within 24 hours, she developed new intraventricular 
conduction delay, and later complete heart block (Figure 1A). Serial echocardiograms 
demonstrated preserved left ventricular systolic function with ejection fraction calculated as 
73% (Supplementary Video 1). She was treated with high-dose glucocorticoids (2mg/kg/day 
IV methylprednisolone) within 24 hours of admission, but nonetheless developed 
progressive clinical deterioration with multisystem organ failure and refractory ventricular 
tachycardia (Figure 1B) from which she could not be resuscitated.
Case 2
A 63-year-old male (Patient 2) with metastatic melanoma was admitted to the hospital with 
fatigue and myalgias 15 days after his initial dose of nivolumab (1mg/kg) and ipilimumab 
(3mg/kg). Diagnostic workup revealed profound ST segment depression, a new 
intraventricular conduction delay, myocarditis (troponin I 47 ng/mL, CK-MB 451 ng/mL), 
and myositis (CPK 20,270 unit/L) (Supplementary Figure 1). Serial echocardiograms 
revealed low-normal left ventricular systolic function with ejection fraction of 50% 
(Supplementary Video 2). He was treated with high-dose glucocorticoids 
(methylprednisolone 1 gram daily for 4 days) and infliximab 5 mg/kg. Despite these 
measures, he developed complete heart block requiring a temporary pacemaker and later 
cardiac arrest. Initial return of spontaneous circulation was achieved, but the patient suffered 
a second cardiac arrest and supportive care was withdrawn.
Results
Both patients had hypertension, but did not have other cardiac risk factors, or history of 
statin use, prior systemic therapies, radiation, or cardiac metastases, and received 
ipilimumab and nivolumab on clinical trials (NCT02320058 and NCT02224781). A post-
mortem gross and microscopic evaluation of both patients was performed. Cardiac 
histopathology on patient 1 showed an intense patchy lymphocytic infiltrate within the 
myocardium also involving the cardiac sinus and atrioventricular nodes (Figure 1C). No 
eosinophilic granulomas or giant cells were noted. Likewise, skeletal muscle showed 
lymphocytic destruction of isolated myocytes (Supplementary Figure 2). Infiltrating cells 
within the myocardium and skeletal muscle were positive for the T-cell marker CD3 (Figure 
1D) or the macrophage marker CD68. T-cell infiltrates showed abundant CD4 and CD8 
positive T cells (data not shown and Figure 1E). Notably, the cells were negative for CD20 
and further immunofluorescence studies showed no antibody deposits (data not shown). 
Post-mortem histopathology of patient 2 showed similar T-cell and macrophage infiltrates in 
the myocardium, cardiac conduction system and skeletal muscle indicative of lymphocytic 
myocarditis and myositis (Supplementary Figure 1 and 2). Importantly, in both patients, 
immune infiltration was restricted to cardiac and skeletal muscle with no other affected 
tissues, including adjacent smooth muscle (Figure 1F). Pre-treatment tumor biopsies from 
each patient demonstrated modest or absent immune infiltrates. By contrast, post-mortem 
evaluation showed substantially increased, intense lymphocytic infiltrates in metastases from 
both patients, particularly in patient 1 (Supplementary Figure 2C–F).

 To further characterize the infiltrating lymphocytes in the myocardium, skeletal muscle, and 
tumor, we performed T-cell receptor next generation sequencing (CDR3 region, the antigen-
binding portion of the T-cell receptor beta chain, ImmunoSeq, Adaptive Biotechnologies)8,9 
to address the distribution, clonality and diversity of T-cell receptor. Both patients shared 
high-frequency T-cell receptor sequences among cardiac, skeletal muscle, and tumor 
infiltrates (Figure 2A, 2B). Specific shared clones were expanded in tumors following 
checkpoint inhibitor therapy. T-cell clonal expansion was most striking in patient 2, in which 
the most abundant T-cell receptor in myocardium and skeletal muscle was expanded more 
than 4-fold in the tumor following treatment (Supplementary Figure 3, 4). By contrast, no 
one specific clonotype predominated in patient 1. These findings raise the possibility that 
antigens (epitopes) present in myocardium, skeletal muscle, and perhaps tumor were 
recognized by the same T-cell clone(s). Whole transcriptome sequencing of the afflicted 
tissues demonstrated high expression of inflammatory T-cell cytokines as well as 
considerable expression of muscle-specific transcripts in the tumor (Supplementary Figure 
5), potentially supporting the hypothesis of a common (shared) epitope between the tumor 
and striated muscle.
To investigate potential patient-specific etiologies, we performed four digit class I and II 
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing (ABC DR DQ DP) (Illumina Miseq) on DNA 
extracted from peripheral blood and formalin-fixed tissue.10 The highly prevalent major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II allele HLA-DQB1*03:01 was the only HLA 
allele shared between cases. Viral myocarditis PCR testing on frozen tissue, as well as viral 
serologies, were negative for adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus, respiratory syncytial 
virus, influenza A, enterovirus, hepatitis C, and HHV-6. To look more broadly for viruses, 
we used a deep-sequencing target-enrichment system designed to detect the genomes of 472 
DNA and RNA viruses known to infect humans (unpublished data, Seidman lab, Harvard 
Medical School). We detected Herpes virus simplex -1 (HSV-1, 38,583 nucleotides, 25.34% 
of the viral genome) sequences in heart tissue, but not in skeletal muscle tissue from patient 
1. We also detected Epstein Barr virus (EBV, 5,456 nucleotides, 3.18% of the viral genome) 
sequences in heart tissue only from patient 2. EBV and HSV-1 have been rarely associated 
with myocarditis.11–13 Given that detection of viral genomes does not necessarily reflect 
active infection, it is uncertain whether these myocarditis cases are of viral etiology.
We then assessed the expression of PD-L1 from tumor tissue and inflamed cardiac and 
skeletal muscle. PD-L1 was expressed on the membranous surface of injured myocytes 
(Supplementary Figure 6) and on infiltrating CD8+ T cells and histiocytes from the inflamed 
myocardium. By contrast, skeletal muscle and tumor specimens were negative for PD-L1 
expression (1% threshold). Similarly, mRNA transcriptional data from patient 2 showed 10-
fold more abundant expression of PD-L1 (CD274) in affected cardiac tissue than in non-
diseased smooth muscle and 5-fold higher than in affected skeletal muscle (Supplementary 
Figure 7).
To assess the frequency of myocarditis and myositis in a larger population, Bristol Myers 
Squibb corporate safety databases were interrogated with a cutoff date of April 2016 to 
identify these events arising during nivolumab +/− ipilimumab therapy. Among 20,594 
patients, 18 drug-related severe adverse events of myocarditis were reported (0.087%).

 Patients who received combination ipilimumab and nivolumab appeared to experience more 
frequent and severe myocarditis compared with those who received nivolumab alone (0.27% 
vs. 0.06%; p<0.001; 5 fatal events vs. 1) (Table 1). Myocarditis with ipilimumab and 
nivolumab therapy arose at a median of 17 days following first treatment (range 13–64 days) 
in multiple cancer types (Supplementary Table 1). Severe (grade 3–4) myositis also appeared 
more frequently with the combination compared with single-agent nivolumab (0.24% vs. 
0.02%) (Table 1). No obvious cardiac or cancer-specific clinical features predisposed 
patients to these severe adverse events (Supplementary Table 1). These events were 
investigator-dependent reports to Bristol Myers Squibb. No clinical trials involving 
nivolumab +/− ipilimumab routinely tested for myocarditis either biochemically or via 
cardiac imaging.
Discussion
Combined immune checkpoint inhibition with ipilimumab and nivolumab produces frequent 
and durable anti-tumor responses in patients with advanced melanoma and has demonstrated 
promising activity in other cancers.14 Immune-related adverse events, however, frequently 
complicate therapy, requiring cessation of therapy in nearly 40% of patients.4,5 These events 
are generally manageable with high-dose glucocorticoids although clinically severe, 
prolonged, and even fatal events rarely occur.4,5 Therefore, characterizing these severe 
toxicities is a major priority, even for uncommon events.
Myocarditis was rarely reported in early clinical trials with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-
PD-1(nivolumab and pembrolizumab), resulting in one death in a patient treated with 
ipilimumab 10 mg/kg in the adjuvant setting.15–18 Our review of a large safety database 
suggests that myocarditis is more frequent and severe with the combination of ipilimumab 
and nivolumab compared with nivolumab monotherapy, but remains rare (<1%) with both 
regimens. Since cardiac monitoring (e.g. ECG or troponin) is not routinely performed in 
most immunotherapy trials, the true incidence is unknown.
Clinicians should be vigilant for immune-mediated myocarditis, particularly due to its early 
onset, non-specific symptomatology and fulminant progression. There are no data as to what 
monitoring strategy may be of value; in our practice we are obtaining a baseline ECG and 
weekly troponin levels during weeks 1–3 for patients on combination immunotherapy. In our 
experience, both patients experienced strikingly elevated troponin levels and refractory 
conduction system abnormalities with preserved cardiac function. Pathological examination 
was reminiscent of acute allograft rejection in cardiac transplantation. In this regard, high-
dose glucocorticoids appeared to blunt ongoing inflammation and resulted in decreasing 
CPK and troponin levels but the data are not directive. Other adjunctive, 
immunosuppressants could also be considered, including infliximab or anti-thymocyte 
globulin.
We sought to mechanistically characterize these aberrant immune responses. Notably, 
striated muscle (cardiac and skeletal) and tumor were the only affected tissues. Robust T-cell 
infiltration, activation and clonal expansion were observed across tissue types with evidence 
of shared high-frequency T-cell receptors. Possible mechanisms for the observed toxicities

 include 1) T cells targeting an antigen shared among the tumor, skeletal muscle, and heart, 
2) the same T-cell receptor targeting a tumor antigen and a different but homologous muscle 
antigen, or 3) clonal, high-frequency T-cell receptor sequences across tumor and muscle 
samples are misleading and distinct T-cell receptor specificities are targeting dissimilar 
antigens. Consistent with the first possibility, we observed high levels of muscle-specific 
antigens (desmin and troponin) in tumors from both patients. It is also conceivable that 
subclinical viral infection could generate T-cell targets, although extensive viral profiling did 
not reveal a clear etiology. Similarly, we did not identify common HLA alleles between 
patients, arguing against an HLA/drug hypersensitivity correlation. Ultimately, defining 
which epitopes are being recognized by these T-cell receptors within the universe of 
potential antigens is a difficult task. Moreover, only early mechanistic insights for any 
immune checkpoint inhibitor-derived toxicities have been generated.19,20 Further studies are 
needed to elucidate causative antigens and molecular mechanisms of these events.
There is biological plausibility for the development of myocarditis from immune checkpoint 
inhibition. In mouse models, PD-1 plays a role in myocardial immune responses and 
protects against inflammation and myocyte damage in models of T-cell mediated 
myocarditis.21 Genetic deletion of PD-1 in mice leads to cardiomyopathy caused by 
autoantibodies against cardiac troponin I.22,23 We did not observe IgG autoantibody 
deposition in the affected tissue, arguing against a directly analogous mechanism. Thus, the 
underlying etiology for T-cell reactivity to myocardial and other striated muscle tissue is not 
clear, and is certainly not universal across patients. Interestingly, we show increased 
expression of PD-L1 in the injured myocardium in our cases, consistent with upregulated 
myocardial PD-L1 in mouse models of T-cell mediated myocarditis.24 PD-L1 upregulation 
in the myocardium is likely a cytokine-induced cardioprotective mechanism that is 
abrogated by immune checkpoint blockade. Better understanding of the mechanism of this 
drug-induced toxicity may provide valuable insight into idiopathic myocarditis in the non-
cancer population, as well as the general interaction between the immune system with the 
myocardium.
