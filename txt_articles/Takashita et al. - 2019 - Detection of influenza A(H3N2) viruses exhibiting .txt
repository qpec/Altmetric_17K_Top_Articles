The novel cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor 
baloxavir marboxil was approved for the treatment of 
influenza virus infection in Japan in February 2018. 
Two influenza A(H3N2) viruses carrying an I38T sub-
stitution in the polymerase acidic subunit (PA) were 
detected in baloxavir-treated children in December 
2018. This mutation is known to confer reduced sus-
ceptibility to baloxavir, and the two mutant viruses 
exhibited 76- and 120-fold reduced susceptibility to 
baloxavir.
The novel antiviral drug baloxavir marboxil was 
approved in Japan on 23 February 2018 for the treat-
ment of influenza virus infection, in patients 12 years 
and older and children younger than 12 years weighing 
10 kg or more; it became available on 14 March 2018 in 
Japan (Figure). The hydrolysed active form of baloxavir 
marboxil (baloxavir acid) inhibits the cap-dependent 
endonuclease of influenza A and B viruses [1]. In Phase 
II and III clinical trials, I38T, I38F and I38M substitutions 
in the polymerase acidic subunit (PA) were detected in 
A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) influenza viruses [2,3]. 
Patients infected with these mutant viruses exhibited 
prolonged virus shedding, and the median time to 
symptom alleviation was longer in baloxavir recipients 
infected with viruses bearing these substitutions than 
in those infected with viruses that lacked these sub-
stitutions [2,3]. Therefore, we conducted nationwide 
monitoring of the baloxavir susceptibility of circulating 
influenza viruses by using a combination of phenotypic 
methods to analyse antiviral susceptibility and geno-
typic methods to detect amino acid substitutions [4].
Detection of PA I38T mutant influenza 
A(H3N2) viruses
In December 2018, influenza outbreaks occurred in two 
primary schools in Yokohama, Japan. We isolated four 
influenza A(H3N2) viruses, A/YOKOHAMA/133/2018, A/
YOKOHAMA/134/2018, A/YOKOHAMA/135/2018 and A/
YOKOHAMA/136/2018, from four children during these 
outbreaks (Table 1). Two patients aged 6 and 7 years, 
infected with A/YOKOHAMA/133/2018 respectively A/
YOKOHAMA/135/2018, were treated with a single oral 
dose of baloxavir marboxil. The third patient, 7-years-
old and infected with A/YOKOHAMA/136/2018, was 
treated with the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor oseltami-
vir, whereas the last patient, aged 7 years and infected 
with A/YOKOHAMA/134/2018, had no exposure to anti-
viral drugs before specimen collection. Fever in the 
two children that received baloxavir resolved within 
2 days of baloxavir administration, and in the child 
that received oseltamivir, it resolved within one day of 
oseltamivir administration. The child without treatment 
had a fever at the time of specimen collection.
Clinical specimens were collected 3 days after baloxavir 
administration, on day 2 of oseltamivir administration 
or on the day after onset. Sequencing analysis detected 
the PA I38T substitution in A/YOKOHAMA/133/2018 
and 
A/YOKOHAMA/135/2018,

YOKOHAMA/134/2018 or A/YOKOHAMA/136/2018. No 
amino acid substitutions associated with reduced sus-
ceptibility to NA inhibitors were detected. These results 
demonstrate that PA I38T mutant viruses were isolated 
from children 3 days after baloxavir administration.
 
Antiviral susceptibilities of the PA I38T 
mutant viruses
We compared the susceptibilities of the PA I38T mutant 
viruses and the wild-type virus to baloxavir and four 
NA inhibitors approved in Japan: oseltamivir, per-
amivir, zanamivir and laninamivir (Table 2). Antiviral 
susceptibilities were determined by using a focus 
reduction assay and a fluorescent NA inhibition assay 
with the NA-Fluor Influenza Neuraminidase Assay Kit 
(Applied Biosystems, California, United States) as pre-
viously described [4]. Baloxavir acid was purchased 
from MedChemexpress (New Jersey, United States). 
Oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir and zanamivir 
were purchased from Sequoia Research Products 
(Pangbourne, United Kingdom), and laninamivir was 
provided by Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). 
Results are expressed as the 50% inhibitory concentra-
tion (IC50).
The IC50 values of the viruses to baloxavir and the 
NA inhibitors are shown in Table 2. Both the PA I38T 
mutant viruses and the wild-type viruses showed nor-
mal inhibition with all four NA inhibitors, whereas the 
PA I38T mutant viruses exhibited 76- and 120-fold 
higher IC50 values to baloxavir compared with the mean 
value of wild-type viruses. These results indicate that 
the PA I38T mutant viruses had reduced susceptibility 
to baloxavir, but remained susceptible to NA inhibitors.
Discussion
A Phase II clinical trial of baloxavir marboxil was con-
ducted in Japan during the 2015/16 influenza sea-
son and Phase III trials were conducted in Japan and 
the United States in the 2016/17 season [2,3]. The 
drug was approved in February 2018 in Japan and in

October 2018 in the United States. During the 2015/16 
and 2016/17 seasons, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 
A(H3N2) viruses, respectively, predominated in Japan. 
During the Phase II trial, the PA I38T and I38F sub-
stitutions emerged after baloxavir treatment in four 
(3.6%) of 112 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses isolated from 
adults aged 20–64 years [4]. In the Phase III trials, the 
PA I38T and I38M substitutions emerged in 36 (9.7%) 
of 370 A(H3N2) viruses obtained from patients aged 
12–64 years and in 18 (23.4%) of 77 A(H3N2) viruses 
obtained from children aged 6 months to < 12 years 
[2,3]. Cumulative data from clinical trials of oseltamivir, 
involving almost 2,000 oseltamivir-treated patients, 
indicate that the incidence of reduced susceptibility 
to oseltamivir is 0.32% in adults and 4.1% in children 
(if low-level mutants detected by genotyping alone in 
mixed virus populations are included, then the corre-
sponding values are 0.4% and 5.4%, respectively) [5]. 
These results suggest that the incidence of influenza 
viruses exhibiting reduced susceptibility to baloxavir is 
higher than that to oseltamivir.
In Japan, baloxavir marboxil became available at the 
end of the 2017/18 influenza season. We isolated 
two PA I38T mutant influenza A(H3N2) viruses from 
baloxavir-treated children in December 2018. PA I38 is 
highly conserved in influenza A and B viruses [3], and 
the I38T substitution was not detected among 17,227 
PA sequences from A(H3N2) viruses in the National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) 
Influenza Research Database (IRD) [6]. Furthermore, 
our sequencing analysis revealed that these two PA 
I38T mutant viruses possessed different PA sequences 
and thus originated from different viruses, suggesting 
no human-to-human transmission. Our findings indi-
cate that these viruses emerged under the selective 
pressure of baloxavir marboxil. In contrast, no viruses 
exhibiting reduced susceptibility to NA inhibitors were 
detected among 90 influenza A viruses tested between 
September and December 2018 in Japan [7]. These 
observations suggest that the emergence of PA I38T 
mutant viruses may increase as the use of baloxavir 
marboxil increases in the 2018/19 influenza season. 
Therefore, the baloxavir susceptibility of influenza 
viruses should be closely monitored.

In vitro studies using the plaque reduction assay 
revealed that influenza A/WSN/33(H1N1) viruses with 
the PA I38T or I38F substitutions show 27.2- and 10.6-
fold higher EC50 values (the 50% effective concentration) 
to baloxavir compared with the wild-type virus [3]. 
Furthermore, influenza A/Victoria/3/75(H3N2) viruses 
with the PA I38T or I38M substitutions showed 56.6- 
and 13.8-fold higher EC50 values, respectively [3]. These 
results suggest that the PA I38T substitution has a 
marked impact on baloxavir susceptibility. In the pre-
sent study, we obtained two influenza A(H3N2) clinical 
isolates possessing the PA I38T substitution. These 
viruses showed 76- and 120-fold higher IC50values to 
baloxavir compared with the mean value of wild-type 
viruses. Our data thus demonstrate that the PA I38T 
substitution is associated with reduced susceptibility 
to baloxavir in currently circulating influenza A(H3N2) 
viruses.
The Technical Expert Working Group of the World Health 
Organization’s (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and 
Response System (GISRS) for Surveillance on Antiviral 
Susceptibility (WHO-AVWG) has established a set of 
criteria to define the NA inhibitor susceptibility of influ-
enza viruses based on the fold-change in IC50 value 
compared with the median value for viruses from the 
same type/subtype/lineage [8]. For influenza A virus, 
use of the terms normal (< 10-fold increase), reduced 
(10–100-fold increase) and highly reduced (> 100-fold 
increase) inhibition is recommended when reporting 
and analysing surveillance data; for influenza B, the 
same definitions are used but for < 5-fold, 5–50-fold 
and > 50-fold increases. The WHO-AVWG is currently 
collecting more data on baloxavir marboxil to establish 
a similar set of criteria to define baloxavir susceptibil-
ity, which should be available in the near future.
In summary, our results indicate that continuous moni-
toring of the emergence of baloxavir-resistant viruses 
is important for public health planning and clinical rec-
ommendations for antiviral drug use.
