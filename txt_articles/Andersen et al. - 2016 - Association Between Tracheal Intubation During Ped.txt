IMPORTANCE Tracheal intubation is common during pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest,
although the relationship between intubation during cardiac arrest and outcomes
is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To determine if intubation during pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest is associated
with improved outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Observational study of data from United States
hospitals in the Get With The Guidelines–Resuscitation registry. Pediatric patients (<18 years)
with index in-hospital cardiac arrest between January 2000 and December 2014 were
included. Patients who were receiving assisted ventilation, had an invasive airway in place,
or both at the time chest compressions were initiated were excluded.
EXPOSURES Tracheal intubation during cardiac arrest.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge.
Secondary outcomes included return of spontaneous circulation and neurologic outcome.
A favorable neurologic outcome was defined as a score of 1 to 2 on the pediatric cerebral
performance category score. Patients being intubated at any given minute were matched
with patients at risk of being intubated within the same minute (ie, still receiving
resuscitation) based on a time-dependent propensity score calculated from multiple patient,
event, and hospital characteristics.
RESULTS The study included 2294 patients; 1308 (57%) were male, and all age groups were
represented (median age, 7 months [25th-75th percentiles, 21 days, 4 years]). Of the 2294
included patients, 1555 (68%) were intubated during the cardiac arrest. In the propensity
score–matched cohort (n = 2270), survival was lower in those intubated compared with
those not intubated (411/1135 [36%] vs 460/1135 [41%]; risk ratio [RR], 0.89 [95% CI,
0.81-0.99]; P = .03). There was no significant difference in return of spontaneous circulation
(770/1135 [68%] vs 771/1135 [68%]; RR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.95-1.06]; P = .96) or favorable
neurologic outcome (185/987 [19%] vs 211/983 [21%]; RR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.75-1.02]; P = .08)
between those intubated and not intubated. The association between intubation and
decreased survival was observed in the majority of the sensitivity and subgroup analyses,
including when accounting for missing data and in a subgroup of patients with a pulse at the
beginning of the event.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among pediatric patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest,
tracheal intubation during cardiac arrest compared with no intubation was associated with
decreased survival to hospital discharge. Although the study design does not eliminate the
potential for confounding, these findings do not support the current emphasis on early
tracheal intubation for pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest.

S
urvival rates from pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest
are improving, yet mortality remains high.1 Most pedi-
atric in-hospital cardiac arrests are precipitated by
acute respiratory failure (hypoxia), and relatively few are
attributable to primary arrhythmias (eg, ventricular fibrilla-
tion or ventricular tachycardia).2,3 Therefore, the standard
paradigm for pediatric in-hospital cardiopulmonary resusci-
tation (CPR) focuses on early effective respiratory support to
establish adequate oxygenation and ventilation and on high-
quality chest compressions to provide adequate myocardial
and cerebral blood flow.4 Although there is increasing evi-
dence supporting the importance of high-quality chest com-
pressions for survival from pediatric in-hospital cardiac
arrests,5 less is known about the importance of invasive air-
way management during CPR.
Invasive airway management for children is often a chal-
lenging and potentially dangerous task. Therefore, it is not
surprising that tracheal intubation in the prehospital setting
did not improve outcomes compared with bag-valve-mask
ventilation during pediatric emergencies, including cardiac
arrest.6 Consequently, recommendations from the Interna-
tional Liaison Committee On Resuscitation Pediatric Task
Force and the American Heart Association support the use of
bag-valve-mask ventilation as opposed to tracheal intubation
in patients with out-of-hospital pediatric cardiac arrest and
with a short transport time.7,8
In contrast to the prehospital setting, a large proportion
ofpediatricin-hospitalcardiacarrestsoccurinanintensivecare
unit, emergency department, or interventional setting
(eg, catheterization laboratory or operating room),9 where the
hospital-based personnel are presumably highly trained for in-
vasive airway management and ventilatory support.
The goal of the current investigation was to examine,
among pediatric patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest,
whether tracheal intubation during cardiac arrest is associ-
ated with survival to hospital discharge. Because acute respi-
ratory failure is a common cause of pediatric in-hospital car-
diac arrest, it was hypothesized that tracheal intubation during
cardiac arrest would be associated with improved survival.
Methods
Data Source
Data from the Get With The Guidelines–Resuscitation
(GWTG-R) registry were used. This is an American Heart As-
sociation–sponsored prospective quality improvement regis-
try of in-hospital cardiac arrests in the United States. The data
collection process and reliability have been described in full
detail.10,11 In the registry, cardiac arrest is defined as pulse-
lessness, or a pulse with inadequate perfusion, requiring chest
compressions, defibrillation, or both and with a hospital-
wide or unit-based emergency response by acute care facility
personnel.Hospital-leveldata(teachingstatusandtypeofhos-
pital) were obtained from the American Hospital Associa-
tion’
s Annual Survey from 2013.12
All participating hospitals in the GWTG-R registry are re-
quiredtocomplywithlocalregulatoryguidelines.Becausedata
are used primarily at the local site for quality improvement,
sites are granted a waiver of informed consent under the com-
mon rule.
Study Population
The cohort included data submitted to the GWTG-R registry
between January 2000 and December 2014. All patients
younger than 18 years who had an index cardiac arrest with 1
minute or more of chest compressions were included. Pa-
tients were excluded if they were receiving assisted ventila-
tion, had an invasive airway (including a tracheostomy tube)
in place at the time chest compressions were initiated, or both.
Furthermore, hospital visitors and cardiac arrests in the de-
livery room or neonatal intensive care unit were excluded. For
the primary analysis and majority of analyses, patients with
missing or inconsistent data on tracheal intubation, timing of
intubation, timing of the end of resuscitation, timing of pulse-
lessness, survival, or relevant covariates were excluded (537
patients [19%], see Figure 1 for details). These patients were
included in a preplanned sensitivity analysis accounting for
missing data (see statistical analysis below).
Intubation and Study Outcomes
Intubationwasdefinedasinsertionofatrachealtubeduringthe
cardiacarrestevent.Unsuccessfulintubationattemptswerenot
counted as intubations. The time to intubation was defined as
the time interval in whole minutes from the start of chest com-
pressions until the tracheal tube was inserted. All times in the
GWTG-Rregistryarecollectedinwholeminutes.Assuch,atime
tointubationof0minutesindicatesthattheintubationwasper-
formed within the same whole minute as chest compressions
were started; a time of 1 minute indicates that intubation was
performed within the next whole minute, etc.
The primary outcome was designated a priori as survival
to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes were return of
spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and favorable neurologic
outcome at hospital discharge. ROSC was defined as no fur-
ther need for chest compressions (including initiation of car-
diopulmonary bypass) that was sustained for longer than 20
minutes. Neurologic outcome was assessed as recommended
by the Utstein guidelines13 using the pediatric cerebral per-
formance category (PCPC) score,14 where a PCPC score of 1
indicates no neurologic deficit; 2, mild cerebral disability;
Key Points
Question Is tracheal intubation during pediatric in-hospital
cardiac arrest associated with a difference in survival?
Findings In this observational study including 2270 matched
patients, tracheal intubation during pediatric cardiac arrest was
significantly associated with decreased survival to hospital
discharge (36% for those intubated compared with 41% for those
not intubated).
Meaning Although the study design does not eliminate the
potential for confounding, these findings do not support the
current emphasis on early tracheal intubation for pediatric
in-hospital cardiac arrest.

3, moderate cerebral disability; 4, severe cerebral disability;
5, coma or vegetative state; and 6, brain death. A PCPC score of
1 and 2 was considered a favorable neurologic outcome, and a
PCPC score of 3 to 6 or death was considered a poor neurologic
outcome. Prospectively designated sensitivity analyses were
performed with different definitions of favorable neurologic
outcome:(1)aPCPCscoreof1or2,ornoincreasefrombaseline;
(2) a PCPC score of 1, 2, or 3; and (3) a PCPC score of 1, 2, or 3, or
no increase from baseline.15
Data abstractors were not blinded to outcomes but were
unaware of the hypothesis of the current study.
Statistical Analyses
The study population was characterized using descriptive
statistics. Categorical variables are presented as counts and
frequencies and continuous variables as medians with 25th
and 75th percentiles. The χ2 test was used to compare cat-
egorical data between independent groups and the Wilcoxon
rank sum test to compare continuous variables. The Cochran-
Armitage test was used to test for linear trends in tracheal
intubation over time.
To assess the adjusted association between tracheal intu-
bation during CPR and survival to hospital discharge, time-
dependent propensity score matching was used.16 A similar
methodology has been successfully applied to the adult car-
diac arrest population and accounts for the time-dependent
nature of interventions during cardiac arrest.17 If the timing of
intubationisnotaccountedfor,itislikelythattheresultswould
be biased toward a harmful effect of intubation, since intuba-
tion can be a function of prolonged resuscitation, and pro-
longed resuscitation is associated with poor outcomes.18
The propensity score was calculated using a multivari-
able Cox proportional hazards model as explained in addi-
tional details in the eMethods in the Supplement. All vari-
ables presented in Table 1 were included in the propensity
score model (see eTable 1 in the Supplement for definitions
of preexisting conditions). All variables were chosen a priori
based on prior work or clinical reasoning derived from
prior publications related to pediatric in-hospital cardiac
arrest.1,11,19,20
Matching (1:1) on the propensity score was performed
using a nearest neighbor–matching algorithm with a maxi-
mum caliper of 0.01 of the propensity score. Patients being
intubated at any given minute (from minute 0 to minute 15)
were separately and sequentially propensity score matched
with a patient who was “at risk” of being intubated within
the same minute. Patients were matched up until 15 minutes
after the cardiac arrest, because intubation at any given min-
ute after 15 minutes was uncommon. At-risk patients
included those still undergoing resuscitation (ie, excluding
patients with ROSC or resuscitation terminated without
ROSC) and who did not receive intubation before or within
the same minute. At-risk patients also included patients intu-
bated at a later point, because the matching should not be
dependent on future events.16,17,21,22 For example, a patient
intubated at minute 3 was matched with a patient who was at
risk of intubation at minute 3 (ie, either a patient intubated
after minute 3 or a patient never intubated). Replacement
of controls was used to reduce the number of unmatched
exposed patients.
To assess the performance of the matching, baseline cat-
egorical variables were compared between the matched
groups using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, and stan-
dardized differences were calculated for which a difference
between −0.1 and 0.1 is generally considered negligible.23
Using the matched cohort, modified Poisson regression was
performed to assess the association between intubation dur-
ing CPR and survival to hospital discharge obtaining risk
ratios (RRs) with robust variance estimates.24,25 To account
for the matching, the correlation between resampled con-
trols, and potential clustering within hospitals, generalized
estimating equations were used as described by Miglioretti
and Heagerty, accounting for the nonnested nature of these
clusters.26 The results from the regression models are
reported as RRs with 95% confidence intervals.
Whether the association between intubation during CPR
and survival varied with the duration of the event was exam-
inedbyaddinganinteractiontermbetweentheintubationvari-
able (yes/no) and time to intubation/matching (ie, time from
start of chest compressions to the minute the patient was
matched) to the modified Poisson regression model. Time was
first treated as a linear continuous variable and next as a cat-
egorical variable (0-5, 6-10, and 11-15 minutes).

Three predefined sensitivity analyses were performed.
First, multiple imputations were performed to account for
missingdata.Categoricalvariableswereimputedusingthefully
conditional specification method, and continuous time vari-
ables were imputed using Poisson distributions as described
in more detail in the eMethods in the Supplement. Second, the
primary analysis was performed after excluding those pa-
tients who received cardiopulmonary bypass (extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation) during the event. Third, the main
analysis was performed including only those patients who had
2 minutes or more of chest compressions and not including pa-
tients intubated 2 minutes or less after the start of chest com-
pressions. A post hoc sensitivity analysis assessing the poten-
tial influence of an unmeasured confounder was performed
using the method as described by Lin et al.27 Additional de-
tails are provided in the eMethods in the Supplement. As a sec-
ond post hoc sensitivity analysis, we conducted a traditional
propensity score–matched analysis (ie, not accounting for the
timing of intubation). Additional details are provided in the
eMethods in the Supplement.
As a predefined subgroup analysis, the cohort was re-
stricted to those patients who lost pulse at any time during the
event. For this analysis, the time to intubation was calculated
as the time from loss of pulse to intubation, and patients who
were intubated before pulselessness were excluded. Then an
approach similar to that described above was used to assess
whether intubation during CPR was associated with out-
comes in this subgroup of patients. As a post hoc analysis, a
subgroup analysis was also conducted in only those who re-
ceived CPR for bradycardia and inadequate perfusion (ie, pulse
present at initiation of CPR).
Exploratory analyses tested whether the association be-
tween intubation during CPR and survival to hospital dis-
charge differed according to multiple subgroups. The sub-
groups included age group, illness category, whether the
patients had preceding respiratory insufficiency, and the lo-
cation of the event. This was tested by adding interactions be-
tween the intubation variable and the subgroup variable of in-
terest to the modified Poisson regression model in the
propensity-matched cohort. Given the exploratory nature of
theseanalyses,amorestringent2-sidedPvalue(<.01)wascon-
sidered significant.
All hypothesis tests were 2-sided, with a significance level
of P < .05 apart from the exploratory analyses of subgroup as-
sociations. All secondary analyses should be considered ex-
ploratory, as no adjustments except as noted were made for
multiple comparisons. No power calculation was performed
before the study. All statistical analyses were conducted using
SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).

months[25th-75thpercentiles,21days,4years]).Ofthese,1555
(68%) were intubated during the cardiac arrest. For these pa-
tients, the median documented time to successful tracheal in-
tubation from start of compressions was 5 minutes (25th-
75th percentiles, 2-11), see Figure 2. There was a decrease in
the proportion of patients being intubated over time (79% in
2000to62%in2014,P = .001forlineartrend).Only13ofthose
intubated (0.8%) received a tracheostomy tube. Baseline char-
acteristics according to intubation status are presented in
Table 1.
Overall Outcomes and Unadjusted Analyses
Overall, 1162 patients (51%) survived to hospital discharge. In
unadjusted analysis, tracheal intubation during CPR was
associated with decreased survival to hospital discharge
(667/1555 [43%] vs 495/739 [67%]; RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.59-
0.69]; P < .001). ROSC was achieved in 1766 patients (77%).
In unadjusted analysis, tracheal intubation during CPR was
associated with decreased ROSC (1130/1555 [73%] vs 636/739
[86%]; RR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.81-0.88]; P < .001). Data on neu-
rologic outcomes at hospital discharge was missing for 414
patients (18%), all of whom survived, since nonsurvivors
were classified as poor neurologic outcome. In patients with
data on neurologic outcome, 557 of 1880 (30%) had a favor-
able neurologic outcome, which corresponds to 557 of 748
survivors (74%). In unadjusted analysis, tracheal intubation
during CPR was associated with decreased favorable neuro-
logic outcome (313/1318 [24%] vs 244/562 [43%]; RR, 0.55
[95% CI, 0.48-0.63]; P < .001).
Time-Dependent Propensity-Matched Multivariable
Analyses
Of the 2294 patients, 2270 were matched based on the pro-
pensity score. The baseline characteristics of the matched
cohort are presented in Table 2. The groups were well
matched on all included variables (all P values >.10 and stan-
dardized differences between −0.1 and 0.1). In the propensity
score–matched cohort, survival to hospital discharge was
lower in those intubated compared with those not intubated
during CPR (411/1135 [36%] vs 460/1135 [41%]; RR, 0.89 [95%
CI, 0.81-0.99]; P = .03). There was no significant difference in
ROSC (770/1135 [68%] vs 771/1135 [68%]; RR, 1.00 [95% CI,
0.95-1.06]; P = .96) or favorable neurologic outcome (185/987
[19%] vs 211/983 [21%]; RR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.75-1.02]; P = .08)
between those intubated and not intubated during CPR. The
results are summarized in Figure 3. The results were similar
in magnitude with each of the different sensitivity defini-
tions of favorable neurologic outcome (eTable 2 in the
Supplement). None of the interactions as described in the
methods sections were significant, indicating no significant
subgroup difference in this study for age group, illness cat-
egory, preceding respiratory insufficiency, or the location of
the event.
Timing of Intubation
There was no significant interaction between tracheal intuba-
tion during CPR and the timing of the matching for any of the
outcomes for either the linear (P = .50) or the categorical
(P = .86) version of time. Thus, the association between tra-
cheal intubation during CPR and survival did not change with
the duration of the cardiac arrest.
Sensitivity Analyses
The sensitivity analysis accounting for missing data in-
cluded 2831 patients. Between 2736 and 2768 patients were
matched in the 10 imputed data sets. The combined estimate
from the 10 data sets showed that tracheal intubation during
CPR was associated with decreased survival (RR, 0.88 [95%
CI, 0.79-0.99]; P = .03) and decreased favorable neurologic
outcome (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.73-0.98]; P = .03). There was
no association with ROSC (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.93-1.05];
P = .79).
One hundred eleven patients (5%) received cardiopulmo-
nary bypass (ie, extracorporeal CPR) during the event, 2
patients had missing data on this variable, and 2181 patients
were included in the analysis excluding those patients; 2116
patients were matched based on the propensity score. In this
cohort, tracheal intubation during CPR was associated with
decreased survival (RR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.81-0.99]; P = .04).
Tracheal intubation during CPR was not associated with
ROSC (RR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.95-1.08]; P = .73) and not associ-
ated with favorable neurologic outcome (RR, 0.95 [95% CI,
0.82-1.09]; P = .44). Survival to hospital discharge was 41%
(46/111) in those who received cardiopulmonary bypass, and
87% (97/111) were intubated during CPR.
In the sensitivity analysis only including patients receiv-
ing at least 2 minutes of chest compression, 1762 were pro-
pensity-score matched. In this group, tracheal intubation dur-
ing CPR was associated with decreased survival to hospital
discharge (RR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.80-1.00]; P = .04). Intubation
was not associated with ROSC (RR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.94-1.07];
P = .91) or favorable neurologic outcomes (RR, 0.89 [95% CI,
0.73-1.10]; P = .29).

Distribution of time from start of chest compression to documented successful
intubation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in those intubated. Of
the 1555 patients (68%) intubated during the CPR event, the median time to
intubation from start of chest compressions was 5 minutes (25th-75th
percentiles, 2-11). Data on time to intubation were recorded in whole minutes.
Time to intubation of 0 minutes indicates that intubation was performed in the
same whole minute as the start of chest compressions.

The results for the post hoc sensitivity analysis exploring
the potential influence of an unmeasured confounder are pre-
sented in the eFigure in the Supplement. Based on the find-
ings of this analysis, it is unlikely that an unmeasured con-
founder is masking a positive association (ie, that intubation
is associated with improved survival). For example, for the
point estimate of the adjusted RR to be 1.20 (ie, a clinically
meaningful effect), the unmeasured binary confounder would
have to be prevalent and strongly associated with intubation
(eg, a prevalence of 20% in those not intubated and 40% in
those intubated) and be very strongly associated with in-
creased mortality (an RR between 3.5 and 4.0), independent
of measured confounders. None of the measured confound-
ers (Table 1) comes close to fulfilling these criteria.
For the post hoc analysis using traditional propensity
score matching, 1388 patients were matched. In this analysis,
intubation compared with no intubation was associated with
decreased survival (368/694 [53%] vs 458/694 [66%]; RR,
0.80 [95% CI, 0.71-0.91]; P < .001), decreased ROSC (555/694
[80%] vs 591/694 [85%]; RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.88-1.00];
P = .05), and decreased good neurologic outcome (193/573
[34%] vs 231/536 [43%]; RR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.66-0.93];
P = .005).
Subgroup Analyses
In the subgroup of patients documented as pulseless (ie, ex-
cluding those with severe bradycardia requiring CPR), 1494 pa-
tients were included. Of these patients, 1019 (68%) were in-
tubated during CPR, and overall survival to hospital discharge
was 40%. The median time from pulselessness to successful
intubation in these patients was 5 minutes (25th-75th percen-
tiles, 2-10). For the subgroup analyses, 1706 patients were
matched; the groups were well matched on all included vari-
ables after propensity score matching (all P values >.10 and
standardized differences between −0.1 and 0.1; see eTable 3
in the Supplement). In this subgroup, tracheal intubation dur-
ing CPR was not associated with survival to hospital dis-
charge (RR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.77-1.01]; P = .07). Intubation also
was not associated with ROSC (RR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.91-1.05];
P = .53) or favorable neurologic outcomes (RR, 0.83 [95% CI,
0.68-1.02]; P = .07).
The post hoc analysis of the subgroup of patients who
started the event with a pulse (ie, severe bradycardia requir-
ing CPR) included 935 patients, with an overall survival to
hospital discharge of 66%. Of these, 223 (24%) lost their
pulse during the event. Five hundred seventy-three patients
(61%) were intubated, with a median time from start of chest
compressions to intubation of 6 minutes (25th-75th percen-
tiles, 2-11). Six hundred fifty patients were matched. The
groups were reasonably well matched on all included vari-
ables after propensity score matching (all P values >.01 and
standardized differences between −0.18 and 0.18; see eTable
4 in the Supplement). In this subgroup, tracheal intubation
during CPR was associated with decreased survival to hospi-
tal discharge (RR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.75-0.98]; P = .03) and
decreased favorable neurologic outcome (RR, 0.72 [95% CI,
0.58-0.90]; P = .003). Intubation was not associated with
ROSC (RR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.95-1.06]; P = .90).

Discussion
Although tracheal intubation to achieve effective oxygen-
ation and ventilation is a basic tenet of advanced CPR for
pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrests, this study was unable to
demonstrate any association of improvement in survival
with tracheal intubation during CPR when using time-
dependent propensity score matching in this large multi-
center study of pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest. Impor-
tantly, this study found that tracheal intubation during CPR
was associated with decreased survival to hospital discharge
in the primary propensity-matched analysis. This association
was consistently demonstrable with several sensitivity and
subgroup analyses.
Tracheal intubation is the current standard of care in the
setting of in-hospital cardiac arrest and is commonly priori-
tized and accomplished during in-hospital pediatric cardiac
arrest. The data confirmed that this is the most common
approach, as 68% of children who were not already intubated
or receiving assisted ventilation at the time of CPR were
intubated during CPR. Although recent guidelines have
deemphasized the focus on tracheal intubation during
cardiac arrest, especially in the adult population, the op-
timal approach to airway management during cardiac arrest
in general and particularly pediatric in-hospital cardiac
arrest remains unknown.7,28 Underlying pulmonary or air-
way disease and a presumed respiratory etiology are com-
mon in pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest,2,3,29 providing
the rationale for invasive airway management. However,

Unadjusted and adjusted analyses as well as sensitivity analyses and the
subgroups of pulseless patients and patients with a pulse at the beginning of
the event for the primary outcome survival to hospital discharge and the
secondary outcomes return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and favorable
neurologic outcome at hospital discharge. ROSC was defined as no further need
for chest compressions that was sustained for greater than 20 minutes.
Neurologic outcome was determined using the pediatric cerebral performance
category (PCPC) score, for which a PCPC score of 1 indicates no neurologic
deficit; 2, mild cerebral disability; 3, moderate cerebral disability; 4, severe
cerebral disability; 5, coma or vegetative state; and 6, brain death. A PCPC score
of 1 and 2 was considered a favorable neurologic outcome, and a PCPC score of
3 to 6 or death was considered a poor neurologic outcome. The “main adjusted”
analysis refers to the multivariable time-dependent propensity score–matched
analysis. CPB indicates cardiopulmonary bypass; CPR, cardiopulmonary
resuscitation.

tracheal intubation during CPR also carries potential compli-
cations and risk of adverse events.30 Intubation may result in
interruptions of chest compressions31 or in delay of other
interventions such as defibrillation, achieving vascular
access, or epinephrine administration, which could influence
outcomes.15,32 In addition, the resuscitation leader may also
be the most skilled operator, so the choice to intubate during
CPR may prevent the resuscitation leader from attending to
non–airway-related resuscitation efforts. Another potential
detrimental effect of tracheal intubation is hyperventilation
and increased intrathoracic pressure, which has been found
to be common in cardiac arrest and can result in worse out-
comes in animal models.33-35 Importantly, a malpositioned
tracheal tube could result in poor oxygenation and ventila-
tion, particularly if not recognized rapidly.
Existing literature on tracheal intubation during pediat-
ric in-hospital cardiac arrest is scarce.36 Gupta et al36 con-
ducted a retrospective review of pediatric intensive care unit
cardiac arrests at a single center. Of 391 patients, 194 (50%)
were not intubated or receiving invasive mechanical ventila-
tion prior to the arrest. In this subgroup, the authors found
no association between the timing of invasive airway place-
ment (tracheal intubation) and survival or favorable neuro-
logic outcome, but the power of their study to find a differ-
ence was limited. Their findings are consistent with those
reported for adult in-hospital cardiac arrests37 and consis-
tent with those reported here. However, the analytic meth-
odologies, multicenter data, and size of the database differ
substantially. In the current analysis, the association be-
tween the timing of intubation during CPR and outcomes
was assessed by adding an interaction term between intuba-
tion and the timing of intubation and matching to the model.
This interaction was nonsignificant, indicating that the asso-
ciation between intubation during CPR and outcomes did
not change with the duration of the arrest.
In the out-of-hospital setting, a quasi-randomized trial in-
cluding 591 children in cardiac arrest found no difference in
outcomes between patients in cardiac arrest receiving intu-
bation compared with bag-valve-mask ventilation (24/301 vs
24/290 survivors).6 In a large observational study of out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest in adults, Hasegawa et al38 found that
tracheal intubation as compared with bag-valve-mask venti-
lation was associated with decreased odds of survival and de-
creased favorable neurologic outcome. Given the substantial
differences between in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac
arrest3 and between pediatric and adult cardiac arrest,11 any
direct comparison to the current study is challenging.
In this study of in-hospital pediatric cardiac arrest, time-
dependent propensity score matching was used, which allows
for adjustment for covariates, including time-dependent
covariates, and adjustment for the time-dependent risk of
being intubated during CPR—something not possible using
traditional regression.16,21 As described in detail in the
Methods section, this approach is superior to traditional
regression or propensity score matching in situations in
which a time-dependent intervention is assessed. Further-
more, the practical relevance of using this approach has pre-
viously been shown in relation to 2 high-impact observa-
tional studies regarding epinephrine administration in
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The 2 studies used the same
out-of-hospital database, but one used time-dependent pro-
pensity score matching,17 whereas the other used traditional
propensity score matching,39 ultimately yielding differing
results. One potential reason for these inconsistent results is
that an intracardiac arrest intervention (eg, epinephrine or
intubation) can be a function of the duration of the cardiac
arrest (ie, patients are more likely to receive the interven-
tion if the cardiac arrest is prolonged), thereby confounding
the results. Moreover, the intervention might influence the
duration of the event (ie, a patient being intubated might
have ROSC because of the intubation), and adjusting for
duration of the arrest is therefore difficult when using tradi-
tional propensity score matching or regression. The use of
time-dependent propensity matching addresses these
issues and allows for slightly different interpretation of the
results. Specifically, the effect estimates (risk ratios) should
be interpreted as the risk of the outcome in those being
intubated during CPR at a given minute (from 0 to 15) rela-
tive to the risk of the outcome in those not being intubated
during CPR at that given minute, which include those being
intubated at later time points. This interpretation is more
clinically relevant, because a clinician might consider intu-
bating a patient at any given minute with future events
being unknown.
Theresultoftheanalysisusingtraditionalpropensityscore
matching indicated a stronger association between intuba-
tion and poor outcome. However, as discussed above, this
analysis should be interpreted with caution, as it did not take
into account the timing of intubation.
Although an association between intubation and de-
creased survival to hospital discharge was found, no sig-
nificant association between intubation and neurologic
outcome was seen in the main time-dependent propensity-
matched multivariable analysis. There are a number of
possible explanations for this finding. First, the current data
set had a relatively high frequency of missing data on neuro-
logicoutcome(18%,correspondingto36%ofsurvivors),which
limits the power and interpretability of the findings. Second,
neurologic outcome was based on a nongranular scoring
system,40 for which there might be significant variability in re-
porting, biasing the results toward the null hypothesis. These
potential explanations are supported by the findings of simi-
lar point estimates for the risk ratios for survival and favor-
ableneurologicoutcomebutwiderconfidenceintervalsforthe
latter, resulting in nonsignificant findings. These concerns
prompted this study, a priori, to use survival—an objective and
almost uniformly reported outcome—as the primary out-
come measurement.
The results of the current study should be interpreted in
the context of the study design and several limitations. First,
this was an observational study, and unmeasured confound-
ers could have influenced the results. The registry does not
have data on the specific indication for intubation, data on
clinician experience or background, quantitative data on the
quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or data on the
effectiveness of noninvasive oxygenation and ventilation

prior to intubation during CPR. However, the sensitivity
analysis assessing the potential influence of an unmeasured
confounder indicated that any unmeasured confounder
would be unlikely to mask a positive association between
intubation and survival. The lack of data on clinician experi-
ence and background also limits the ability to assess whether
intubation could be beneficial if provided by more experi-
enced clinicians and the ability to adjust for clustering by cli-
nician. Second, intubation attempts are not recorded in the
registry, and unsuccessful intubation attempts are classified
as “not intubated” and were therefore included in that group
in the analyses. This is in contrast to the intent-to-treat prin-
ciple most often used in randomized clinical trials and could
have biased the results, especially if failed intubation
attempts during CPR led to poor outcomes. However, this
likely would have biased the results toward the null. Third,
the GWTG-R registry has very limited information on post-
ROSC care, and we were therefore unable to describe this
aspect. Fourth, the study may have been underpowered to
detect some clinically relevant associations, especially for
neurologic outcomes and interactions.
Conclusions
Among pediatric patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest, tra-
cheal intubation during cardiac arrest compared with no in-
tubationwasassociatedwithdecreasedsurvivaltohospitaldis-
charge. Although the study design does not eliminate the
potential for confounding, these findings do not support the
current emphasis on early tracheal intubation for pediatric in-
hospital cardiac arrest.
