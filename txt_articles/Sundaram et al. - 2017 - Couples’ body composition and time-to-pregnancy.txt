STUDY QUESTION: Is couples’ body compositions associated with reduced fecundity as measured by a longer time-to-pregnancy (TTP)?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Couples whose BMI are within obese class II (≥35 kg/m2) have a longer TTP in comparison to leaner (BMI <
25 kg/m2) couples, observed only when both partner’s BMI was jointly modeled.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Extremes of BMI have been associated with a longer TTP and with less successful assisted reproductive
technology (ART) outcomes. To our knowledge, the association between measured adiposity in both partners of the couple and prospectively
measured TTP has not been investigated despite pregnancy being a couple-dependent outcome.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Prospective cohort with preconception recruitment of 501 couples trying for pregnancy and
recruited from 16 counties in Michigan and Texas between 2005 and 2009. Couples were followed daily for up to a year of trying or until
a hCG pregnancy.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In-home standardized anthropometric assessment of couples upon enroll-
ment included measured height and weight using calibrated stadiometers and scales, and measured waist and hip circumferences. Discrete-
time Cox regression was used to estimate fecundability odds ratios (FORs) and 95% CIs, controlling for potential confounders including age,
number of days of vigorous physical activity, serum cotinine concentration, race, education, free cholesterol levels for each partner in
partner-specific models and for both partners in couple-based models as well as average acts of intercourse per menstrual cycle and men-
strual cycle regularity.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Neither male nor female partner’s BMI was associated with TTP when modeled indi-
vidually. However, obese class II (BMIs ≥ 35.0 kg/m2) couples experienced a reduction in fecundability in both unadjusted (FOR = 0.45; 95%
CI: 0.23, 0.89) and adjusted analyses (aFOR = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.98) resulting in a longer TTP in comparison to couples with normal BMI
(<25 kg/m2). Female partners’ waist circumference ≥88.6 cm was associated with a significant reduction in fecundability in the unadjusted
model (FOR = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.86) but not in the adjusted model (aFOR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.55, 1.08) in comparison to females with a
smaller (<80 cm) circumference.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: BMI and waist circumference are proxy measures of body composition and residual con-
founding cannot be eliminated. Findings may not be generalizable to clinical populations.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This is the first cohort study known to us with preconception enrollment of couples who
underwent standardized anthropometric assessment and for whom TTP was prospectively measured. The findings underscore the import-
ance of considering both partners’ body composition for fecundity outcomes and preconception guidance.

Introduction
Female obesity, as measured by BMI, has been associated with
reduced fecundability in several epidemiologic studies (Zaadstra et al.,
1993; Jensen et al., 1999; Bolúmar et al., 2000; Hassan and Killick,
2004; Law et al., 2007; Ramlau-Hansen et al., 2007; Wise et al., 2010;
McKinnon et al., 2016). Previous investigators also have assessed
increased central adiposity (waist-to-hip ratio [WHR] and waist cir-
cumference)
and
fecundability
with
equivocal
results
reported
(Zaadstra et al., 1993; Wass et al., 1997; Wise et al., 2010; McKinnon
et al., 2016). The primary focus of these studies has typically been on
the association between female adiposity measures and fecundability,
and often relying on self-reported BMI and/or retrospectively reported
time-to-pregnancy (TTP). While male BMI has been inversely associated
with semen quality (Jensen et al., 2004; Chavarro et al., 2010; Eisenberg
et al., 2014) and infertility (Sallmén et al., 2006; Nguyen et al., 2007;
Ramlau-Hansen et al., 2007), we are unaware of research where couples’
body compositions inclusive of BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-height
ratio (WHtR) and WHR were measured along with prospectively ascer-
tained TTP. Such findings are important given that TTP is a couple-
dependent outcome.
Though a few past studies have recognized the importance of studying
couples, they have been limited in important ways. In particular, a previ-
ous study evaluated the role of male and female obesity on sub-
fecundity (TTP > 12 months) and found a higher odds of subfertility
when both partners were obese (Ramlau-Hansen et al., 2007).
However, this earlier study relied upon self-reported BMI and retro-
spectively recalled TTP among pregnant women. Among couples under-
going fertility treatment with measured BMI, couple obesity has been
associated with poorer outcomes including decreased blastocyst devel-
opment (Bakos et al., 2011), fewer normally fertilized oocytes (Shah
et al., 2011), and decreased likelihood of a clinical pregnancy (Keltz et al.,
2010; Bakos et al., 2011; Shah et al., 2011) or live birth (Bakos et al.,
2011; Shah et al., 2011; Colaci et al., 2012; Petersen et al., 2013). Still,
some authors report no associations (Schliep et al., 2015).
In light of the continuing obesity epidemic in the USA (Ogden et al.,
2014) and elsewhere (Berghöfer et al., 2008) and increasing recognition
of the importance of male partners for couple fecundity, we sought to
evaluate the association between couples’ BMIs and central adiposity in
relation to prospectively assessed fecundity, as measured by TTP. This
couple-based approach is in keeping with preconception guidance being
directed to both partners of the couple (Johnson et al., 2006).
Materials and Methods
Study population
The study population comprises 501 couples who were recruited from 16
counties in Michigan and Texas upon discontinuing contraception given
their intentions of trying for pregnancy and enrolled in the Longitudinal
Investigation of Fertility and the Environment (LIFE) Study (Louis et al.,
2011). By design, enrollment criteria were minimal: (i) females aged 18–40
years with male partner age 18+ years; (ii) married or in a committed rela-
tionship; (iii) self-reported menstrual cycle length between 21 and 42 days
as required by the fertility monitor; (iv) ability to communicate in English or
Spanish; (v) no use of injectable hormonal contraception in the prior 12
months. Couples with a physician diagnosis of infertility were ineligible for
participation as were couples off contraception for >2 months. Couples
were followed for up to 12 months of trying for pregnancy, with monthly
hCG pregnancy tests at the time of expected menses.
Ethical approval
Institutional review board approvals were obtained from all collaborating
institutions; couples gave written informed consent prior to study partici-
pation and any data collection.
Data collection and operational definitions
The research team met with eligible couples largely in their homes for
enrollment and initial data collection purposes. Female partners completed
a home pregnancy test to ensure they were not already pregnant at enroll-
ment. Research assistants conducted baseline interviews with each partner
of the couple regarding their medical and reproductive history and smoking
and alcohol consumption during the past 12 months. Physical activity for
both men and women was ascertained at baseline based on their
responses to a two-part question asking about whether they followed a
regular vigorous exercise program, and if yes, for how many days. Couples
completed daily journals on intercourse and women recorded menses and
pregnancy test results while trying for pregnancy. Women were instructed
in the use of the Clearblue® Easy fertility monitors, SPD Development
Co., Switzerland consistent with the manufacturer’s guidance commencing
on Day 6 of their cycle to help time intercourse to ovulation. The monitor
tracks levels of estrone-3-glucoronide (E3G) and LH and gives a visual
prompt of low, high and peak fertility. Women were also instructed to use
the digital Clearblue® Easy home pregnancy test, SPD Development Co.,
Switzerland on the day of expected menses and a week later. The fertility
monitor has been shown to be highly accurate in detecting the LH surge
(99%) and in predicting peak fertility (91%) compared with gold standard
ultrasonography (Behre et al., 2000). The Clearblue® Digital home preg-
nancy test is capable of detecting pregnancy with 99% accuracy (false posi-
tive results range from 0 to 0.3%, depending on the pregnancy test lot)
when used from the day of expected menses (Tomlinson et al., 2008).
Trained research nurses performed a standardized anthropometric
assessment at baseline as proxies of couples’ body composition (Lohman
et al., 1988). Anthropometric measurements included height using a port-
able stadiometer, body weight using calibrated electronic scales and cir-
cumferences (waist, hip). Specifically, all study participants were asked to
remove shoes, stand erect with their back to the wall and shoulders
relaxed at the sides and looking straight ahead for measurement of height.
The nurse took two measurements rounded to the nearest ½ inch and a
third if the difference was more than ½ inch. The final value for each of the
anthropometric measures was based on the average of the two closest
measurements. All participants were weighed using the digital self-
calibrating Health-O-Meter scale after removing shoes and excessive
clothing. The nurse was instructed to take two measurements and record
weight to the nearest pound. If the measurements differed by more than
663
Couples’ body composition and time-to-pregnancy
 one pound, a third measurement was taken. The final weight used was the
average of the two closest measurements. Self-reported weights were
used for participants with weights in excess of 330 pounds, the upper limit
for the accuracy of the weight scale. Waist circumference was taken at the
natural waist location (i.e. the narrowest part of the torso) using a standar-
dized cloth tape measure that was placed over the skin or light clothing
while the participant was standing. The placement of the tape measure
was made with the nurse standing to the right of the participant and after
locating the lowest rib on the right side of the iliac crest. With minimal res-
piration, the participant held the tape measure in place while the nurse
ensured the tape measure was in a plane parallel to the floor and was snug
without compressing the skin. Two measurements were taken, with a third
measurement taken if the difference was ¼ inch or more. Hip circumfer-
ence was taken at the level of maximum extension of the buttocks.
BMI (kg/m2) was calculated from measured height (converted to centi-
meters) and weight (converted to kilograms) and categorized as: normal
or underweight (<25.0), overweight (25.0–29.9), obese class I (30.0–34.9)
and obese class II (≥35) for analysis. In addition to waist circumference,
other central adiposity measurements were taken, including WHR for
women and WHtR for both men and women. Measures of central adipos-
ity were categorized further using existing cut points for waist circumfer-
ence (cm) (males: <94, 94 to <101.6, ≥101.6; women: <80, 80 to <88.6,
≥88.6), WHtR (men: ≥0.5; women: ≥0.5) and WHR for women (≥0.80)
(Lean et al., 1995; Ashwell and Hsieh, 2005; Consultation, 2011).
Couple fecundity was measured by the number of prospectively
observed menstrual cycles required for a couple to become pregnant, con-
ditional on not being pregnant in the previous cycle, i.e. TTP. A menstrual
cycle was considered as the first day of bleeding in one cycle to the first
day in the next cycle using data prospectively obtained from the fertility
monitor and daily journal, both of which tracked menses. Pregnancy was
defined as a positive home hCG pregnancy test.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive characteristics of the study population were calculated and com-
pared for both the partners. The Cox model for discrete-time survival ana-
lysis was used to estimate the association between various anthropometric
proxies of body composition (BMI, waist circumference, WHtR and WHR
among females only) and TTP while adjusting for relevant covariates.
Specifically, we calculated fecundability odds ratios (FOR) and 95% CIs for
each body composition proxy. FORs <1.0 denote decreased fecundability as
measured by a longer TTP, while FORs >1.0 reflect enhanced fecundability
or a shorter TTP. Couples who withdrew from the study before pregnancy
or who were not pregnant after 12 months of trying were censored at the
last observed cycle for all analyses. The analyses accounted for left truncation
for the time couples were off contraception prior to enrollment. We ana-
lyzed anthropometric measurements separately for each partner in
individual-based models, as well as together in a couple-based model, and
adjusting for a priori selected covariates based on the literature. In the
individual-based models, these covariates included: age (in years), number of
days of vigorous physical activity per week, active smoking status (serum
cotinine concentration ≥10 versus <10 ng/ml [Benowitz et al., 2009]) and
free cholesterol levels (log-transformed), as a proxy or global marker for
lifestyle and diet (Schisterman et al., 2014). Given the uncertainty about
model specification for fecundability-related endpoints in the absence of
strong empirical data, we ran additional models adjusting for other potential
confounders: race (white or not), education (college level or not), average
acts of intercourse per menstrual cycle, and for the female only model, self-
reported menstrual cycle regularity (regular or not) at baseline. In couple-
based models, we further analyzed the couple’s joint profile of their
anthropometric measures adjusting for a priori selected covariates based on
the literature. The models allowed for a separate regression coefficient for

Results
Description of the study cohort by partner is presented in Table I.
Specifically, couples tended to be white, college educated and parous.
Overall, 27% of women and 41% of men were found to be obese class
I or higher (BMIs ≥ 30.0 kg/m2), with 40% of men having a waist cir-
cumference of ≥101.6 cm and 47.3% of women with a waist circum-
ference of ≥88.6 cm. The majority of the cohort was inactive with 60%
of women and 58% of men reporting engaging in physical activity <1
time/week.
Among the anthropometric measurements taken individually on each
partner of the couple, only female waist circumference ≥88.6 cm was
significantly associated with fecundability, reflecting a ~36% reduction
relative to couples whose female partner had a waist circumference of
<80 cm (Table II). This association remained significant after adjustment
for relevant confounders. However, the association was attenuated after
further adjustment for average frequency of intercourse per cycle, men-
strual cycle regularity and both partners’ race and education. A dose-
response relation was observed between female but not male BMI, and
between female but not male waist circumference and fecundability,
though the trend was not significant. Both female and male higher WHtR
and female WHR showed association with reduced fecundability.

Couples’ body composition and time-to-pregnancy
 When modeling both partners’ body composition in the couple-
based model, an interesting pattern emerged for overweight or obese
class I female partners whose male partners had normal BMIs
(Table III). A 54% reduction in fecundability was observed when the
female partner was overweight/obese class I despite the male partner
having a normal BMI (aFOR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.95). However, the
significance was attenuated with further adjustment for average fre-
quency of intercourse per cycle, menstrual cycle regularity, both part-
ners’ race and education. A comparable reduction in fecundability was
observed for couples where both had BMIs categorized in the obese
class II range (aFOR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.21, 1.00). These findings were
robust after covariate adjustment. However, in light of the cholesterol
measurements being non-fasting and the potential to consider it as an
intermediate or confounder as both BMI and cholesterol were mea-
sured at the same point in time, we assessed our findings in absence of
cholesterol and the results remained consistent. Also, our results for
BMI and fecundability remain consistent on additional adjustment for
average acts of intercourse to our main model. Of the multiple central
adiposity measures assessed in couples, only female partner’s waist
circumference was associated with diminished fecundability (Tables II
and IV). Specifically, female waist circumference >88.6 cm (35 inches)
was associated with a 23–36% reduction in fecundability in comparison
to smaller waist women (<80 cm) irrespective of the male partner’s
waist measurement or model. We also found reduced fecundability
across all categories of couples’ waist circumferences as compared to
the referent group comprising couples where both partners had smal-
ler waists, i.e. female partner’s waist circumference <80 cm and male
partner’s waist circumference <94 cm. The findings were corrobo-
rated when considering WHR for the females and waist circumference
for the males (Table IV) with FORs <1.0. However, these findings
were not consistent. Specifically, couples with male partners having larger
waist circumferences between 94 and 101.6 cm but with female partners
having smaller WHR (<0.8) showed significant reductions (50%) in
fecundability compared to couples with smaller waist circumferences
(aFOR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.94). Lastly, we observed no association
between couples WHtR and fecundability (results not presented).
Discussion
In this prospective cohort study with preconception enrollment of
couples without infertility and for whom standardized anthropometric
assessments were performed at baseline or before trying for preg-
nancy, we found diminished fecundability among couples whose female
partners were overweight or obese class I, and also for couples whose
partners were both obese class II. Fecundability was reduced by
~59%, even after covariate adjustments. Moreover, female but not
male central adiposity as measured by waist circumference was asso-
ciated with reduced fecundability, though not consistently. While BMI
provides an estimate of weight for height, it does not differentiate mus-
cle from fat rendering it only a proxy of body composition relative to
other measures of body composition. Our findings underscore the
importance of including both partners in studies of body composition
and obesity when assessing couple fecundity.
Our findings for couple’s BMI and reduced fecundability are consistent
with previous literature that also observed that the odds of sub-fecundity
(TTP > 12 months) were increased for obese couples (Ramlau-Hansen
et al., 2007). This earlier study relied upon retrospectively reported
dichotomized TTP (≤12 versus >12 months) and BMI among pregnant
couples, whereas we recruited couples prior to conception with mea-
sured BMI and prospectively observed TTP. As such, our findings are
not restricted to couples achieving pregnancy, and may better represent
the distribution of fecundability. Our finding that overweight and obese
class I women had significantly reduced fecundability even if their male
partner was of normal weight supports previous studies evaluating the
role of female BMI, though direct comparisons are difficult as these studies
tended to rely solely on the female’s self-reported BMI (Zaadstra et al.,

 1993; Jensen et al., 1999; Bolúmar et al., 2000; Law et al., 2007; Wise
et al., 2010; McKinnon et al., 2016). Our findings were also consistent with
previous reports that obesity was associated with reduced fecundability
even among women with regular menstrual cycles (Jensen et al., 1999;
Law et al., 2007). These results are also in line with some previous studies
among couples seeking fertility treatment that observed lower odds of live
birth when both partners were overweight or obese (BMI > 25 kg/m2)
(Petersen et al., 2013).
Our lack of a consistent significant negative association between
women’s waist circumference and fecundability supports findings of a
recent prospective pregnancy study, but not all earlier findings.
Specifically, reduced fecundability was observed among studies focusing
on couples undergoing fertility treatment (Zaadstra et al., 1993; Wass
et al., 1997), and among one prospective pregnancy study of female waist
circumference and fecundability (McKinnon et al., 2016) though not in
another (Wise et al., 2010). Our findings that couples whose male part-
ners’ have larger waist circumferences experience diminished fecund-
ability are consistent with findings focusing on waist circumference and
diminished semen quality (Chavarro et al., 2010; Eisenberg et al., 2014),
though differences in semen quality do not always translate into associa-
tions with couple fecundity (Louis et al., 2014).
Our study has important limitations including the absence of direct
measures of body composition (e.g. dual-energy X-ray absorpti-
ometry, skinfolds, impedance), and a relatively crude measure of phys-
ical activity. Consistent with this observational design, the potential for
possible residual confounding or unmeasured confounders that may
account for the findings cannot be ruled out. The measured BMIs for
our cohort are skewed toward higher ranges but are consistent with
reproductively aged couples in USA (Ogden et al., 2014). Our findings
need to be interpreted within the framework of these important lim-
itations along with the study’s notable strengths such as preconception
enrollment, standard anthropometric assessment of both partners,
and prospectively ascertained TTP. In addition, the extent to which
our findings are generalizable to study populations recruited from clin-
ical or volunteer settings remain to be established.
Overall, obese couples were found to have approximately half the
fecundability as couples with normal BMI. Our findings suggest that
couple obesity may be an important ‘reproductive toxicant’. These
findings highlight the importance of couples’ body composition for
fecundity, and the need for appropriate preconception guidance.
