IMPORTANCE Sexual dysfunction, an important determinant of women’
s health and quality of
life, is commonly associated with declining estrogen levels around the menopausal transition.
OBJECTIVE To determine the effects of oral or transdermal estrogen therapy vs placebo on
sexual function in postmenopausal women.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Ancillary study of the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention
Study (KEEPS), a 4-year prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of
menopausal hormone therapy in healthy, recently menopausal women. Of 727 KEEPS
enrollees, 670 agreed to participate in this multicenter ancillary study. Women were 42 to 58
years old, within 36 months from last menstrual period. Data were collected from July 2005
through June 2008 and analyzed from July 2010 through June 2017.
INTERVENTIONS Women were randomized to either 0.45 mg/d oral conjugated equine
estrogens (o-CEE), 50 μg/d transdermal 17β-estradiol (t-E2), or placebo. Participants also
received 200 mg oral micronized progesterone (if randomized to o-CEE or t-E2) or placebo (if
randomized to placebo estrogens) for 12 days each month.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Aspects of sexual function and experience (desire, arousal,
lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain) were assessed using the Female Sexual Function
Inventory (FSFI; range, 0-36 points; higher scores indicate better sexual function). Low
sexual function (LSF) was defined as an FSFI overall score of less than 26.55. Distress related
to low FSFI score (required for the diagnosis of sexual dysfunction) was not evaluated.
RESULTS The 670 participants had a mean (SD) age of 52.7 (2.6) years. The t-E2 treatment
was associated with a significant yet moderate improvement in the FSFI overall score across
all time points compared with placebo (average efficacy, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.11-4.10; adjusted
P = .002). With o-CEE treatment, there was no significant difference in FSFI overall score
compared with placebo (mean efficacy, 1.4; 95% CI, −0.1 to 2.8; adjusted P = .13). There was
no difference in FSFI overall score between the t-E2 and o-CEE groups on average across 48
months (adjusted P = .22). In the individual domains of sexual function, t-E2 treatment was
associated with a significant increase in mean lubrication (0.61; 95% CI, 0.25-0.97; P = .001)
and decreased pain (0.67; 95% CI, 0.25-1.09; P = .002) compared with placebo. Overall, the
proportion of women with LSF was significantly lower after t-E2 treatment compared with
placebo (67%; 95% CI, 55%-77% vs 76%; 95% CI, 67%-83%; P = .04). For o-CEE there was
no significant reduction in the odds of LSF.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Treatment with t-E2 modestly improved sexual function in
early postmenopausal women, but whether it relieved symptoms of distress is not known.

 H
ypoestrogenemia is the endocrine hallmark of meno-
pause and is characterized by 5- to 10-fold reduction
in circulating levels of estradiol (E2).1 Over time, low
E2 levels result in vaginal dryness and dyspareunia, often ac-
companied by symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy.2 These
symptoms significantly contribute to the increased inci-
dence of sexual disorders in menopausal women.3-5 Estradiol
is also a modulator of serotonergic function, affecting re-
gions of the brain known to regulate mood and desire, which
mayhavedirectorindirecteffectsonsexualfunction.1,6Atleast
23% of naturally menopausal women are distressed by their
low sexual desire,7 whereas midlife women with higher lev-
elsofenjoymentfromsexualactivityexperienceahighersense
of purpose in life.8 The US Food and Drug Administration
has recently identified female sexual dysfunction (FSD) as a
serious condition with unmet needs as part of its program on
patient-oriented drug development.9
A recent meta-analysis revealed that treatment with es-
trogens alone or in combination with progestogens was asso-
ciated with a small to moderate improvement in sexual func-
tion relative to placebo (particularly in pain), when used in
women with menopausal symptoms or in early postmeno-
pause(ie,within5yearsofamenorrhea).10However,theanaly-
sis did not stratify by the route or composition of estrogens
used. We hypothesized that transdermal estradiol (t-E2) might
bemoreeffectivefortreatmentofsexualdysfunctioninmeno-
pausal women than oral estrogens due to pharmacokinetics
that result in an E2 to estrone ratio that approximates that seen
prior to menopause.11 Indeed, plasma concentration of free E2
with t-E2 use is twice that seen with oral formulations.12
The Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS) is a
randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial origi-
nallydesignedtotestwhetherestrogentreatmentreducespro-
gression of atherosclerosis when initiated within 36 months
of the last menstrual period.13 In KEEPS, transdermal 17β-
estradiol (t-E2) was directly compared with oral conjugated
equine estrogen (o-CEE) to determine whether both have
equivalent effects on menopause-associated symptoms.14 The
ancillary KEEPS–sexual study examined changes in sexual
function over time in recently postmenopausal women ran-
domized to either o-CEE or t-E2 for 4 years.
Methods
Menopausal women from 9 recruitment sites across the United
States participated in KEEPS. They were within 3 years of their
final menstrual period, and all provided written informed con-
sent. Institutional review boards at participating sites ap-
proved the study procedures. A detailed description of recruit-
ment, participating clinical centers, inclusion and exclusion
criteria,safetymonitoring,andrandomizationandblindingpro-
tocols for KEEPS has been published.15-17 (See Supplement 1 for
theTrialProtocol.)Inbrief,eligiblewomenwerebetween42and
58 years of age and at least 6 months and no more than 36
months from last menstrual period, with plasma follicle-
stimulating hormone level at least 35 mIU/mL (to convert to IU
per liter, multiply by 1.0) and/or E2 levels less than 40 pg/mL
(toconverttopicomolesperliter,multiplyby3.671).Womenex-
cluded from the study were those who had undergone hyster-
ectomy or surgically induced menopause; abnormal mammo-
gramresult;severepsychiatricillnessincludinguntreatedmajor
depression; a history of clinical cardiovascular disease includ-
ing myocardial infarction, angina, congestive heart failure, or
thromboembolic disease; those with coronary artery calcifica-
tionwithAgatstonscoreatleast50U(indicatingsignificantsub-
clinical coronary artery disease); as well as current moderate or
heavy smoking (>10 cigarettes/d by self-report), severe obe-
sity (body mass index [BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms
divided by height in meters squared] >35), dyslipidemia (low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol >190 mg/dL [to convert to mil-
limoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259]), hypertriglyceridemia
(triglycerides >400 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter,
multiply by 0.0113]), uncontrolled hypertension (systolic
blood pressure >150 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure
>95 mm Hg), or fasting glucose level greater than 126 mg/dL (to
convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555).
Eligible KEEPS participants were randomized in a ratio of
4:4:5 to either oral o-CEE, 0.45 mg/d and placebo patches with
micronized progesterone, 200 mg, for 12 days each month;
t-E2, 50 μg/d and placebo pills with micronized progester-
one, 200 mg, for 12 days each month; or placebo pills and
patches. The administered dose of 50 μg/d t-E2 was found to
beequivalentto0.3to0.625mg/do-CEEwithregardtochanges
inurinarycalciumexcretion,vaginalepithelialmaturation,and
symptom relief; 0.45 mg/d o-CEE was chosen to approximate
the equivalent dose and allow adequate symptom relief.17,18

Inventory (FSFI) questionnaire, a validated tool assessing the
key dimensions of sexual function along 6 domains of sexual
function, including desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satis-
faction, and pain.20,21 In brief, each domain has a score range
that, when multiplied by a domain-specific factor, gives the in-
dividual domain score. The overall FSFI scale score equals the
sumofthe6domainscores,withhigherscoresreflectingbetter

Key Points
Question What are the effects of transdermal or oral estrogen
therapy on sexual function in recently postmenopausal women
over time?
Findings In this ancillary study of a randomized clinical trial that
included 670 healthy menopausal women within 3 years of their
last menstrual period, transdermal estradiol improved overall
sexual function score compared with placebo.
Meaning Transdermal estradiol therapy may improve sexual
function in postmenopausal women with low sexual function.

 to be associated with clinically significant distress as a diag-
nostic criterion.9,23 Because we did not evaluate distress, we
defined overall FSFI score of less than 26.55 as low sexual
function (LSF) rather than sexual dysfunction.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive analyses using χ2 tests and analysis of covariance
were conducted to compare the participants’ demographic
and clinical characteristics at baseline. Mixed model repeated-
measures analysis was used primarily to evaluate the effi-
cacy of treatments. The approach proposed by Fitzmaurice
et al24(pp126-132) was used. Unstructured covariance matrix was
used to account for the correlation between repeated assess-
ments within the same individual. Time and group interaction
wasincludedasthemaineffect.Linearcontrastswereperformed
to compare the change from baseline at each time point across

Results
The trial began in July 2005, with complete enrollment of 727
participants in the parent trial by June 2008. Data collection
concluded by March of 2012. Six hundred seventy of the 727
KEEPS enrollees agreed to participate in the sexual function
ancillary study (n = 209 in the o-CEE group, n = 204 in the t-E2
group, and n = 257 in the placebo group). Figure 1 displays the
ancillary study’
s CONSORT flow diagram. Participant demo-
graphic characteristics for the KEEPS–sexual study popula-
tion are presented in Table 1. No significant differences were
observed in baseline characteristics among the groups. There
were also no significant differences between the treatment
groups in the scores for each individual sexual function
domain nor in the overall sexual function score or in SHBG lev-
elsatbaseline.Last,FSFIoverallandsubdomainscores,aswell
as SHBG levels, were comparable at baseline across the 3 treat-
mentgroupswhenparticipantswerestratifiedbyLSF(Table2).
Significant improvements were observed in FSFI overall
scores for participants who received o-CEE and t-E2 treat-
ment compared with those who received placebo. We also ob-
served significant improvement in all subdomain scores at 18
months in the t-E2 treatment group (Figure 2 and eTable in
Supplement 2).
FSFI Overall Score
The mean FSFI overall score moderately yet significantly in-
creasedby2.6points(95%CI,1.1to4.1;adjustedP = .002)from
baseline in the t-E2 treatment group compared with that in pla-
ceboonaverageacross48months,whichcorrespondstoa7.2%
improvement over placebo on the FSFI range of 36 points. The
mean FSFI overall score increased with t-E2 treatment relative
to placebo, with consistent effect size of 2.9, 2.1, and 2.8 points
at 18, 36, and 48 months, respectively (P = .001, .02, and .005,
respectively;P = .63fordifferenceamongvisits),althoughinboth
thet-E2andplacebogroupsthemeanabsoluteFSFIscoretrended

Witho-CEEtreatment,themeanoverallFSFIscoreincreasedby
1.4pointscomparedwithplacebo(95%CI,−0.1to2.8;adjusted
P = .13), a 3.9% improvement. However, the increase peaked at

 SHBG Levels
BecauseSHBGlevelswereavailableonlyatbaselineand36and
48 months, analysis was limited to these time points. As ex-
pected, SHBG levels were stable over time in the placebo and
t-E2–treated groups with no significant differences in the
levels between these 2 groups (Figure 2H and eTable in
Supplement 2). Conversely, SHBG levels significantly in-
creased with o-CEE treatment relative to both baseline and the
other treatment groups at 36 and 48 months (P < .001), al-
though it declined significantly from 36 to 48 months (mean,
7.5; 95% CI, 4.3-10.6 nmol/L).
Low Sexual Function
At baseline, the prevalence of LSF was 74% (140 of 190), 71%
(129 of 182), and 74% (173 of 234) among the o-CEE, t-E2, and
placebo groups, respectively (P = .76) (Table 2). Only t-E2 treat-
ment significantly reduced the overall rate of LSF compared
with placebo (adjusted rate, 67%; 95% CI, 55%-77% vs 76%;
95% CI, 67%-83%; P = .04).

of t-E2 treatment on FSFI scores compared with placebo was

(P < .001). In contrast, the effect was −0.2 points (95% CI, −3.0
to 2.6; P = .88) for women without LSF at baseline. The P value
for interaction was .02 (Figure 3), indicating the significant ef-
fect modification by baseline LSF status. Similarly, the overall
o-CEE effect on FSFI score was significant only in the LSF sub-
group (2.1 points; 95% CI, 0.5 to 3.7; P = .01 vs −0.3 points; 95%

 as on LSF in recently postmenopausal women. Symptoms re-
lated directly to tissue effects of estrogens on the reproductive
tract, such as lubrication and pain on penetration, demon-
strated a progressive exacerbation with time in the untreated
group and were alleviated with the use of t-E2 across all time
points. The more subjective domains of desire, arousal, or-
gasm, and sexual satisfaction demonstrated a relatively steady
state over time in the untreated group and were improved only
at 18 months of treatment with t-E2. This may suggest that the
effect of t-E2 on psychological aspects of the sexual response is
independent from its effect on physiological aspects. Simi-
larly, the overall improvement in FSFI in the o-CEE–treated
group at 36 months appears to be predominantly due to signifi-
cant improvements in the physical aspects of sexual function
(lubrication and pain), although not in libido-related aspects.
ThedegreeofimprovementinFSFIthatwasobservedwith
t-E2 use may be clinically meaningful. Temporally, t-E2 ap-
pears to be effective earlier than o-CEE (a mean of 2.1 points at
18 months, which corresponds to 11.6% difference in improve-
ment in FSFI score) and last longer (a mean of 1.8 points better
at 48 months, a 10.3% difference). This efficacy may be due to
consistently elevated E2 levels detected in t-E2–treated KEEPS
participantsrelativetoplaceboandtoo-CEE–treatedwomen.19
Still, at 36 months, there was no significant difference in im-
provement between the 2 treatment arms.
While the treatment efficacy of t-E2 was limited to women
with LSF, this population made up the majority of healthy
menopausal women in the KEEPS cohort. Women with LSF
mayhavebeenmotivatedtoenrollinatrialofhormonetherapy
based on previously reported benefits of hormone therapy for
treatment of LSF, thus increasing the proportion of women in
the trial with LSF. In addition, our definition of LSF was based
entirely on an FSFI score of less than 26.55. Because we did
not collect information on distress related to sexual function,
which is required for the diagnosis of LSF, the proportion of
women in the general population with LSF may be much
lower.26 Women without preexisting LSF based on the FSFI in
KEEPSshowedagradualdeclineinsexualfunctionaftermeno-
pause independent of treatment regimen. While women with
LSF at baseline benefited from menopausal hormone therapy,
those without dysfunction did not appear to experience
improved sexual function, an FSFI threshold-dependent
improvement that was not previously explored.
Estrogen therapy alleviates menopause-related symp-
toms, including hot flashes, night sweats, palpitations, insom-
nia, irritability, and vaginal atrophy.27,28 The presence of hot
flashes has previously been associated with poor sexual
function.29-32 We therefore sought to explore whether allevia-
tionofthesesymptomsovertimesignificantlyimprovessexual
function. Controlling for changes in hot flashes, however, did
not significantly affect changes in FSFI overall score nor group
comparisons, suggesting that symptoms relief following treat-
ment does not significantly contribute to the improvements
observed in sexual function.
The lack of improvement with o-CEE treatment in libido-
related domains of desire and arousal relative to placebo is in
accord with the association of hepatic induction of SHBG (me-
diated by oral estrogens), resultant decline in free (bioavail-
able) androgens, and decreasing libido in postmenopausal
women.33-36 In contrast, physical symptoms of lubrication and
painseemunmitigatedbytheincreaseinSHBGlevels.Wethere-
fore conclude that potential reduction in the bioavailability of
testosterone may only explain the lower efficacy of o-CEE rela-
tive to t-E2 in libido-associated domains but cannot account for
variations in physical aspects of sexual function. In support,
modest improvements in the physical aspects of sexual func-
tioninpostmenopausalwomentreatedwithlow-doset-E2were
unaffected by endogenous testosterone levels.37
Limitations
Advantages of the ancillary KEEPS–sexual study include the
large sample size and randomized placebo-controlled design
of the trial, as well as the unique nature of the studied popu-
lation (menopausal women within 3 years of onset of meno-
pause), the latter minimizing potential confounders related to
aging that have previously been shown to be associated with
sexualdysfunction.38-41Limitationsincludetherestrictedgen-
eralizability of the findings to other ethnic groups or to women
with a lower educational level and socioeconomic status be-
cause the KEEPS population is composed predominantly of
whitewomenofahighereducationalbackgroundthanthegen-
eral US population.
Furthermore, although relationship change is known to
affect sexual function at the menopause transition,42,43 fol-
low-up measures of partner status were not available for our
cohort, precluding analysis of the effect of change of partner
status on the efficacy of hormone treatment. Moreover, this
study did not account for lack of sexual activity, as well as
women who prefer forms of sexual activity other than
penetrative intercourse, which in both cases may lead to un-
derestimation of FSFI overall score.
Another potential limitation is the cutoff score used to de-
fine LSF that is validated for women aged 18 to 74 years.22
Therefore, additional measures, such as distress associated
with sexual function (ie, through the Female Sexual Distress
Scale44) or a clinical interview by a trained expert in sexual

 function may have been informative, as they can potentially
“correct”fortheFSFIscoredefiningsexualdysfunctioninearly
postmenopausal women. Although the latter would have also
allowed for a clinical diagnosis of sexual dysfunction, it is not
practical in a large clinical trial in which sexual function is just
one of many end point measures. Finally, assessing symp-
toms of vulvovaginal atrophy (ie, dryness and dyspareunia)
could have confirmed the improvement observed in the physi-
cal aspects of sexual function and put them in a clinically rel-
evant context.
Conclusions
In summary, in a randomized clinical trial of hormone therapy
in early postmenopausal women, treatment with t-E2 pro-
vided modest benefits for sexual function. The efficacy of
o-CEE treatment seemed to be less than that of t-E2, espe-
cially in the subgroup of women with LSF, although there was
no statistically significant difference between the hormone
groups on overall sexual function.
