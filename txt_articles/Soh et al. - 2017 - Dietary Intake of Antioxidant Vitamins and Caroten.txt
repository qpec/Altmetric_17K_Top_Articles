Antioxidants may protect against oxidative stress, which is associated with tuberculosis (TB) disease. However,
direct evidence for a protective association between dietary antioxidants and TB incidence in humans has been
lacking. The relationship between intake of antioxidant vitamins (vitamins A, C, D, and E) and individual carot-
enoids (α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and lutein) and TB incidence was examined in the
Singapore Chinese Health Study, a prospective cohort study of 63,257 adults aged 45–74 years enrolled during
1993–1998. Baseline intake of these antioxidants was estimated using a validated semiquantitative food frequency
questionnaire including questions on use of dietary supplements. After an average of 16.9 years of follow-up,
1,186 incident active TB cases were identified among cohort participants. Compared with the lowest quartile,
reduced risk of active TB was observed for the highest quartile of vitamin A intake (hazard ratio = 0.71, 95% confi-
dence interval: 0.59, 0.85; P-trend < 0.01) and β-carotene intake (hazard ratio = 0.76, 95% confidence interval:
0.63, 0.91; P-trend < 0.01), regardless of smoking status. Lower TB risk was seen for vitamin C intake among cur-
rent smokers only. Other vitamins and carotenoids were not associated with TB risk. These results suggest that
vitamin C may reduce TB risk among current smokers by ameliorating oxidative stress, while vitamin A and β-carotene
may have additional antimycobacterial properties.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death globally,
and an estimated 2–3 billion people in the world are infected
with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterium (1). Malnu-
trition is known to impair immune function (2–4), and poor
nutritional status has been identified as an important risk fac-
tor for progression from TB infection to active TB disease
(5, 6). However, most studies examining the relationship
between malnutrition and TB risk have focused on protein-
energy malnutrition (5, 7), and there is a paucity of studies
examining the relationship between specific micronutrients
and TB disease. Micronutrients are required for the immune
system to function efficiently (8, 9), and antioxidant nutrients
such as vitamins and carotenoids can counteract the potential
damage caused by free radicals (9, 10), levels of which are ele-
vated during TB infection (11, 12). It has been shown experi-
mentally that defective host antioxidant defenses contribute to
increased oxidative stress during TB infection and that restora-
tion of oxidative stress levels with antioxidants is potentially
beneficial in the prevention of TB disease (13).
Low levels of micronutrients are commonly observed among
TB patients (14–18), and TB patients have been reported to
have increased levels of oxidative stress on top of low circu-
lating concentrations of antioxidant vitamins (19, 20). However,
most of the epidemiologic evidence assessing the relation-
ship between micronutrients and TB disease has been based
on cross-sectional and case-control studies, which were unable
to establish a cause-effect (causal) relationship, as the acute-
phase response during TB infection can lead to changes in
nutrient status (5, 21). Among the prospective cohort studies
that have investigated the relationship between micronutrient
status and incidence of active TB, lower blood levels of vita-
mins A and C have been reported to be associated with higher

 TB incidence (22), while another study did not find low serum
vitamin A level to be significantly associated with increased
risk of TB (23). However, those investigators did not adjust
for cigarette smoking, a strong risk factor for TB, in their
analyses (22, 23). Higher intake of fruits and vegetables was
reported to be associated with lower TB incidence more than
a decade ago (24), but the role of specific dietary nutrients
in these food sources in TB risk has not been well studied.
It is unclear whether dietary intake of antioxidant vitamins
and carotenoids prior to the onset of disease plays a role in
modulating the development of active TB and whether the
associations of different vitamins and carotenoids with TB
risk differ.
We examined the relationship between dietary intake of
antioxidant vitamins (vitamins A, C, D, and E) and carotenoids
(α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and lutein)
and risk of developing active TB disease, using data from a
prospective population-based cohort study of middle-aged
and elderly adults in Singapore. Members of this cohort went
through periods when TB was highly prevalent in the coun-
try a few decades ago, and those who had acquired latent TB
infection in those early years would be at risk of disease reac-
tivation at an advanced age (25).
METHODS
Study population
This study was conducted using data from the Singapore
Chinese Health Study, which consisted of 63,257 Chinese
adults aged 45–74 years recruited between April 1993 and
December 1998 (26). Enrolled participants were citizens or
permanent residents of Singapore residing in government
housing estates, which was where the majority (86%) of the
resident Singapore population lived during the period of
recruitment. The study participants were restricted to the 2
major dialect groups of Chinese in Singapore—the Hokkiens,
who originated from the southern part of Fujian Province,
and the Cantonese, who came from the central region of
Guangdong Province (26). Recruitment was initiated using a
posted letter to invite potential participants to take part in the
study. Study staff went door to door 5–7 days later to recruit
participants for the study, if they met the inclusion criteria
based on their ethnicity, age, dialect group, and residency
status. Approximately 85% of the eligible subjects invited
agreed to participate. This study was approved by the Institu-
tional Review Board of the National University of Singapore,
and all study participants gave informed consent.
Assessment of dietary exposure
A face-to-face interview was conducted during recruit-
ment using a structured questionnaire, and information col-
lected included participant demographic characteristics,
lifetime use of tobacco, alcohol consumption, and physician-
diagnosed medical history, such as history of diabetes and
cancer. A 165-item semiquantitative food frequency ques-
tionnaire specifically developed for this study population
was used to assess the usual diet of the participant over the
past year. This questionnaire has been validated using two
24-hour dietary recall interviews and repeat administration
of the food frequency questionnaire in a subset of 810 cohort
participants, and most mean pair values for energy and nutrients
were within 10% of each other according to the 2 different
methods (26). Dietary intake of specific nutrients for each study
participant was computed on the basis of the Singapore Food
Composition Database, which was created specifically for this
study (26).
Case ascertainment and follow-up
Identification of active TB cases in the study cohort was
conducted via linkage analysis of the cohort database with
the National TB Notification Registry (27) through December
31, 2014. Notification of TB cases in Singapore is mandatory
by law, and all cases of suspected and confirmed TB must be
reported to the Ministry of Health within 72 hours. Follow-up
of the cohort was made by regular linkage to the Singapore
Registry of Births and Deaths to update information on the
vital status of cohort members. As of December 31, 2014,
only 52 participants were known to be lost to follow-up, due
to migration out of Singapore or for other reasons.
Statistical analysis
We excluded participants with a history of TB before
recruitment (n = 3,012), as recorded in the National TB Noti-
fication Registry. We also excluded participants with a base-
line history of cancer (n = 1,807) due to possible changes in
dietary habits after cancer diagnosis. Participants who reported
extreme energy intakes (<700 kcal/day or >3,700 kcal/day
for men and <600 kcal/day or >3,000 kcal/day for women;
n = 967) were additionally excluded, so the final analyses
included 57,471 participants. Baseline characteristics of parti-
cipants who developed TB and those who remained free of
TB at the end of the study were compared using χ2 tests for
categorical variables and Student’s t tests for the continuous
variables that followed a normal distribution. Person-years
of follow-up for each participant were calculated from the date
of recruitment to the date of diagnosis of active TB, death, loss
to follow-up, or December 31, 2014, whichever occurred ear-
lier. Dietary intakes of vitamins and carotenoids were energy-
adjusted using the nutrient density model (28), and intakes
were expressed per 1,000 kcal per day. Quartile levels of the
nutrient density of each vitamin and carotenoid intake were
derived from their respective distributions among all of the
study participants in the cohort.
Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to
examine the relationship between the nutrient density of vita-
mins and carotenoids and the risk of developing active TB. We
included total energy intake in the model to control for poten-
tial confounding by total energy intake and to examine the
association between dietary composition and disease risk. The
analysis also included adjustment for factors that have been
shown to affect TB risk in our cohort or others (29–32). The
first model adjusted for age at recruitment, year of baseline
interview, sex, dialect group, level of education, and total
energy intake. The highest level of education attained by the
study participant was our surrogate for the participant’s socio-
economic status. The second model additionally adjusted for

 body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2), baseline history
of diabetes, smoking intensity, alcohol intake, tea intake, and
energy-adjusted intakes of protein, cholesterol, marine ω-3
fatty acids, and ω-6 fatty acids. The strength of a given associ-
ation was measured using the hazard ratio and its correspond-
ing 95% confidence interval. The median intake values of the
quartiles were entered into the statistical models as a continu-
ous variable to examine linear trend. There was no violation of
Cox proportional hazards assumptions for our variables of
interest.
To examine whether vitamins and carotenoids modulate
the risk of active TB via their antioxidant properties, we strat-
ified the analysis by the participant’s smoking status (never,
former, or current smoker), as cigarette smoking is a great
contributor to in vivo oxidative damage (33, 34). Because re-
sponses to questions on nutrient intake could be affected by
age and sex, we also performed analyses stratified by these
factors. The heterogeneity of the associations according to
the different factors was tested by including an interaction
term (the product of quartile nutrient intake and the factor of
interest) in the Cox model.
Analyses were conducted using SAS statistical software,
version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina). All
P values quoted are 2-sided, and P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
RESULTS
As of December 31, 2014, a total of 1,186 incident cases
of active TB were identified in our cohort. The mean duration
of follow-up was 9.1 years for participants who developed
active TB (cases) and 17.1 years for participants who re-
mained free of active TB. The mean age at TB diagnosis was
68.6 years. The incidence rates of active TB, adjusted to the
age structure of our cohort, were 221 per 100,000 person-
years in men and 55 per 100,000 person-years in women.
Compared with participants who did not develop active TB,
TB cases were significantly older and had a lower body mass
index (Table 1). TB cases were more likely to have a history
of smoking or physician-diagnosed diabetes, a lower level of
education, a higher frequency of alcohol intake, and lower in-
takes of protein, marine ω-3 fatty acids, and ω-6 fatty acids
(Table 1). Vegetables were the main dietary sources of vitamin
A (66.7%), α-carotene (87.8%), β-carotene (78.3%), and lutein
(84.2%) in our study population, while fruits were the biggest
contributor to dietary vitamin C (54.5%), β-cryptoxanthin
(99.1%), and lycopene (49.8%) intake. The main dietary sources
of vitamin D were fish and shellfish (42.7%) and dairy products
(16.1%). Vitamin E was mostly obtained from fats/oils (29.3%),
vegetables (17.2%), and grain products (14.0%).
Table 2 shows the association between dietary intake of vita-
mins and risk of active TB in our study cohort. Higher intakes
of vitamins A, C, and E were associated with significantly
reduced risk of developing active TB in a dose-dependent
manner (all P’s for trend < 0.01), while the association
with dietary vitamin D was not significant (P-trend = 0.90)
(Table 2). Adjustment for multiple risk factors did not alter
the inverse association between vitamin A intake and TB
risk (P-trend < 0.01). The multivariable-adjusted hazard
ratio for the highest quartile of vitamin A intake was 0.71
(95% confidence interval (CI): 0.59, 0.85) compared with
the lowest quartile of intake. The adjustment for other risk
factors materially altered the associations between intake of
vitamins C and E and risk of active TB, producing nonsignif-
icant results (Table 2).
High intake of all individual carotenoids except lutein
was significantly associated with reduced risk of active TB
(all P’s for trend < 0.01) (Table 3). Adjustment for other
risk factors significantly attenuated these associations, except
that for β-carotene, which remained statistically significant
(P-trend < 0.01). Compared with the lowest quartile, the high-
est quartile of β-carotene intake was significantly associated
with reduced risk of active TB (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.76,
95% CI: 0.63, 0.91).
Because vegetables were the main dietary source of vita-
min A and β-carotene, we also performed further analyses to
ensure that the reduction in TB incidence was due to these
nutrients and not to other factors associated with increased
vegetable intake. The highest quartile of vegetable intake
was found to be inversely associated with risk of active TB
(HR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.99; P-trend = 0.02), but this
association was attenuated when the model further adjusted
for intake of vitamin A (HR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.78, 1.28;
P-trend = 0.92) or β-carotene (HR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.72,
1.23; P-trend = 0.58) (data not shown). Conversely, addi-
tional adjustment for vegetable intake did not materially
change the association between vitamin A or β-carotene and
risk of active TB.
The inverse associations between intake of vitamin A or
β-carotene and risk of active TB were similar irrespective
of smoking status (P-interaction > 0.43) (Tables 4 and 5).
Although the associations between vitamin A or β-carotene
and risk of active TB among former smokers were not statis-
tically significant, we observed a reduction in TB risk (albeit
not statistically significant) when comparing the highest
quartile of intake with the lowest quartile for vitamin A and
β-carotene among former smokers, and this was consistent
with the results in never and current smokers. On the other
hand, a statistically significant stepwise reduction in TB risk
was observed with increased vitamin C intake among current
smokers (P-trend = 0.02; Table 4) after adjustment for other
risk factors, and the P value for interaction between smoking sta-
tus (never vs. current) and vitamin C intake was of borderline
significance (P-interaction = 0.06). Even though we found a sig-
nificant interaction between smoking status (never vs. current)
and vitamin E intake in risk of TB (P-interaction < 0.01), the
association of reduced TB risk among current smokers was
not statistically significant. The associations between all of the
vitamins and carotenoids studied and TB risk were similar when
we stratified the participants by sex or age group (≤55 years vs.
>55 years) for the analysis (results not shown).
Because there may be a lag period between onset of dis-
ease and diagnosis of the disease, there may have been undi-
agnosed TB cases at the time of recruitment, and the dietary
habits of the participants may have been influenced by the
subclinical conditions of TB. To overcome this potential
bias, we performed the same analyses after excluding all par-
ticipants with less than 2 years of follow-up. The results
were essentially the same (data not shown).

 DISCUSSION
In our prospective population-based cohort study, we found
increased dietary intake of vitamin A and its precursor β-caro-
tene to be associated with reduced risk of active TB, and this
association was significant among both never smokers and cur-
rent smokers. Stratification by smoking status revealed a protec-
tive association between vitamin C intake and TB risk among
current smokers but not among never or former smokers.
The pathogenesis of TB is determined by the balance
between the generation of free radicals to kill intracellular
mycobacteria and the antioxidant mechanisms of the host to
prevent oxidative tissue damage (35), and many studies have
found increased levels of oxidative stress markers, as well as
reduced circulating concentrations of antioxidants, in TB pa-
tients (19, 20). Smoking is an important risk factor for the
development of active TB (29, 36). Exposure to cigarette
smoke can induce oxidative damage in the lungs (34), which
may further elevate levels of oxidative stress on top of the free
radicals produced by the host in response to TB infection (11).
Antioxidant vitamins and carotenoids are able to counteract
the potential damage caused by uncontrolled free radical

 production (9, 10), and vitamins C and E and β-carotene have
been shown to serve as the major nonenzymatic antioxidants
of the lungs in the defense against oxidants (37). Hence, ame-
lioration of increased levels of oxidative stress may be a possi-
ble explanation for the reduction in TB risk with increased
vitamin C intake that was observed only among current smok-
ers. The reduction in risk of active TB with increased intakes
of vitamin A and β-carotene among both never and current
smokers suggests the possibility of additional antimycobac-
terial effects on top of their antioxidant properties.
Vitamin A is known to affect susceptibility to infections
by regulating the expression and differentiation of many
immune cells (38), and it has also been shown to inhibit the
growth of mycobacteria in macrophages (39). A recent study
suggested that reduction of cellular cholesterol via regulation
of Niemann-Pick disease type C2 gene (NPC2) expression
may be a possible mechanism for its antimycobacterial effect
(40). Cholesterol is an essential molecule for phagocytic entry
and intracellular survival of mycobacteria (41), and the reduc-
tion in cellular cholesterol content has been linked to increased
phagosome maturation, which is required to initiate antigenic
presentation and generate adaptive immune responses (41, 42).
Vitamin A can also act synergistically with vitamin D to enhance
maturation of the mycobacterial phagosome by limiting the
expression of the tryptophan-aspartate-containing coat pro-
tein gene (TACO) (43). Although vitamin A has been shown

 to have antimycobacterial properties, its precursor, β-carotene,
did not show any inhibitory effect on the growth of mycobac-
teria in culture (44). Hence, our observation of a protective
association between dietary intake of β-carotene and risk of
active TB may be a result of its conversion into vitamin A
in vivo.
Although increased intake of fruits and vegetables has
been reported to reduce risk of TB disease (24), the dietary
components accounting for this protective association have
not been well examined. To our knowledge, this is the first
prospective cohort study that has comprehensively examined
the relationship between specific antioxidant vitamins and

 carotenoids and the risk of developing active TB, and we
have identified vitamin A and β-carotene to be the potential
nutrients that reduce risk of active TB. The attenuation of the
association between vegetable intake and TB risk after inclu-
sion of vitamin A or β-carotene in the same model suggests
that these nutrients mediated the protective association between
vegetable intake and risk of active TB.
The prospective study design allowed us to establish the
temporality of the associations, and recall bias in the dietary
data is unlikely, since the data were collected before the
participants were diagnosed with the disease. The food fre-
quency questionnaire used was specifically created for this
population and has been well validated (26). The age-adjusted
mean daily intake nutrient densities for vitamins A, C, and E
were comparable between this cohort and respondents to the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in
the United States (26). Even though Singapore currently has
an intermediate TB incidence rate of about 40 per 100,000
population, our study cohort consisted of older residents who
probably resided in the country many decades ago, when TB

 incidence was as high as 300 per 100,000 population (45).
Hence, many of our study participants could have acquired
latent infection in those early years when TB was far more
rampant (25), and this made our cohort suitable to study fac-
tors associated with latent TB reactivation. We were also
able to adjust for other risk factors for TB (29, 32) in our sta-
tistical models, such as smoking, body mass index, history of
diabetes, alcohol intake, total energy intake, and protein
intake. The rate of loss to follow-up in our study cohort was
negligible, and the ascertainment of active TB cases via link-
age with the nationwide registry was virtually complete, as
notification of TB cases is mandatory by law in Singapore.
Our study had some limitations, including the use of baseline
dietary data and smoking status for the analysis. The dietary
and smoking habits of the participants may have changed since
their baseline reporting. Nonetheless, any subsequent changes
would have led to nondifferential misclassification and poten-
tial underestimation of the association between dietary vitamin
and carotenoid intakes and risk of active TB. Because vitamin
D status could be affected by genetic and environmental factors
(46), the use of dietary vitamin D in our analysis may also have
been inadequate to study the relationship between vitamin D
and TB risk. Because most of the TB cases in our cohort were
likely to be cases of disease reactivation, our results may not be
generalized to primary TB infection. We also did not have
information about the use of immunosuppressants or human
immunodeficiency virus status, which can increase the risk of
active TB, but the use of immunosuppressants is likely to be
very low in a population-based cohort, and Singapore has a rel-
atively low human immunodeficiency virus infection rate (45).
The adjustment for socioeconomic status by using highest level
of education as a surrogate was also not optimal. We lacked sta-
tistical power to examine the associations in former smokers
due to the low numbers of former smokers and TB cases among
them in our cohort. Finally, as in any observational study, resid-
ual confounding could not be completely ruled out, although
we adjusted for all identified potentially confounding factors in
the statistical analyses.
In conclusion, we found increased dietary intake of vitamin
A and its precursor, β-carotene, to be associated with reduced
risk of developing active TB in a prospective cohort study of
middle-aged and elderly adults in Singapore. Vitamin C intake
was associated with reduced risk of active TB only among cur-
rent smokers. The reduction in TB risk associated with vitamin
A and β-carotene irrespective of the participant’s smoking
status suggests that these nutrients may exert anti-TB effects
through mechanisms other than their antioxidant properties.
Further research is needed to define the mechanisms of opera-
tion for the antimycobacterial effects of these compounds and
to investigate the use of vitamin A and β-carotene as chemo-
preventive agents for active TB disease.
