Abstract 
Background Diabetes is closely linked to obesity, and obesity rates climb during 
adolescence for reasons that are not clear. Energy efficiency is important to obesity, and we 
describe a temporary but substantial fall in absolute energy expenditure, compatible with 
improved energy efficiency, during the rapid growth phase of puberty.  
Methods In a longitudinal cohort study lasting 10 years, we measured voluntary energy 
expenditure as physical activity (PA) by accelerometry, involuntary energy expenditure as 
resting energy expenditure (REE) by oxygen consumption, BMI, and body composition by 
DEXA annually on 10 occasions from 7-16y in the 347 children of the EarlyBird study. We 
used mixed effects modelling to analyse the trends in REE and their relationship to BMI, lean 
mass, fat mass, age, physical activity and pubertal stage. 
Results Relative REE and total PA fell during puberty, as previously described, but the 
longitudinal data and narrow age-range of the cohort (SD±4m) revealed for the first time a 
substantial fall in absolute REE during the period of maximum growth. The fall became 
clearer still when adjusted for fat mass and lean mass. The fall could not be explained by 
fasting insulin, adiponectin, leptin, LH or FSH. 
Conclusion There appears to be a temporary but substantial reduction in energy expenditure 
during puberty which is unrelated to changes in body composition. If it means higher energy 
efficiency, the fall in REE could be advantageous in an evolutionary context to delivering the 
extra energy needed for pubertal growth, but unfavourable to weight gain in a contemporary 
environment.   
 
Introduction 
Childhood obesity has become an important issue over recent time because of its 
association with early metabolic disturbance.1 Metabolic (type 2) diabetes, which in most 
cases is directly related to obesity, was rarely described in young people a few decades ago, 
but is now the fastest growing chronic disorder of childhood.2 The factors responsible for 
childhood obesity are still unclear. 
Body mass is the integral of past energy intake and expenditure. Intake is a single variable 
that can be controlled voluntarily across its range. Energy expenditure, on the other hand, 
has two components, only one of which (physical activity, PA) is voluntary. PA makes the 
smaller contribution to energy expenditure,3 and declines progressively during adolescence, 
the more so in girls.4,5 The larger part of energy expenditure is involuntary, fuelling the 
metabolic processes that sustain life, and is commonly reported as resting energy 
expenditure (REE). REE is accounted for mostly by metabolism within the body‟s fat-free

tissues (chiefly brain, liver, heart and kidneys), though some is attributable to fat cells. 
Muscle contributes little at rest.  
However, not all energy is used efficiently. Some, such as the thermic response to feeding 
(dietary induced thermogenesis), is lost as heat through a process of energy uncoupling in 
brown adipose tissue,6 and constitutes a further and variable component of involuntary 
energy expenditure. Conversely, tight energy coupling can conserve energy. The amount of 
brown adipose tissue wanes with age, but appears to rise temporarily during puberty, though 
there is wide individual variation.7 
REE can be expressed as total (absolute) REE, or as REE relative to size. Absolute REE is 
deemed to increase during adolescence alongside the increases in lean mass (LM) and fat 
mass (FM) that characterise the pubertal growth spurt.8 An increase in absolute REE with 
growth is intuitive, because body mass is demonstrably the single best predictor of REE,9 
but the evidence tends be based on cross-sectional studies comparing small numbers of 
children at different ages,10 or on correlation. Small numbers carry the risk of unintended 
selection bias which can confound cross-sectional comparisons, and a positive correlation 
does not necessarily mean that the correlates are moving in the same direction – a 
correlation can be positive in cross-section, even though the outcome variable (in this case, 
REE) is falling over time while the explanatory variable (body mass) is rising. Furthermore, 
unless the age range is tight, a sample incorporating an age-dependent variable will not be 
fairly represented by the mean age, and ability to detect age-related change over time 
(resolution) will be compromised.   
There have been few cohort studies of REE in childhood, and what truly longitudinal data 
there is tends to have focused on REE relative to body composition.6,11 Relative REE 
appears to fall during puberty, and one theory to explain the fall cites changing body 
composition, whereby muscle mass increases proportionally during adolescence at the 
expense of other, metabolically more active, tissues. Thus, the brain, liver, heart and 
kidneys, all of which have a high metabolic rate, increase in mass by a factor of ×5-12 from 
birth to maturity, while skeletal muscle, which has a low metabolic rate at rest, increases in 
mass by a factor of forty.12 
Here, we describe the trends in physical activity and REE over the course of childhood in a 
single cohort of contemporary children, and use new observations to explore an alternative 
paradigm – that there are programmed reductions in PA and absolute REE during 
adolescence, creating energy savings which may have been important over evolutionary

time in meeting the additional needs of pubertal growth, but which in a time of plenty now 
compound the risk of adolescent obesity.  
 
 
Methods  
EarlyBird is a non-intervention longitudinal study of healthy school children reviewed every 
six months as a single cohort from 5-16y, and has been described in detail elsewhere.13  It 
was conducted in the city of Plymouth, UK, from 2000-2013, and addressed the question: 
which children become insulin resistant, and why? All 67 Plymouth primary schools were 
identified and their head teachers asked for agreement to participate in the study. Fifty-four 
schools agreed, and were stratified into quartiles according to the proportion of children 
entitled to free school meals, a socio-economic proxy. A random selection was made from 
each quartile and registration for the study invited during school induction meetings, where 
parents expressing interest were given a full explanation. With parents‟ written consent and 
children‟s assent, a total of 307 children (137 girls, 170 boys) who started school between 
January 2000 and January 2001 became the EarlyBird cohort. A further 40 children were 
added at age 9y to redress a gender imbalance. Importantly for the resolution of age-related 
change, the variance in age of the cohort did not exceed SD±4m throughout, and 80% of the 
children were retained for the 12 years of the study. Ethical approval was given in the 
summer of 1999. 
 
Anthropometry: Height was measured every six months to the nearest 1mm (Leicester 
Height Measure, Child Growth Foundation, London), weight to the nearest 200g in light 
clothing (Tanita Solar 1632W electronic scales, West Drayton, Middx). A minimum of three 
'blind' repeats were made of each anthropometric measure at each visit. BMI was defined as 
mass(Kg)/height2(m) 
  
Physical activity (PA) PA was measured objectively each year using Actigraph 
accelerometers (Model: 7164 - formerly MTI/CSA - Fort Walton Beach, FL). Actigraph 
accelerometers are of good technical reproducibility,14 and correlate well with criterion 
measures of free-living activity-related energy expenditure.15 The accelerometers were worn 
on an adjustable elastic belt around the child‟s waist, and were set to run continuously for 
seven days (five school days and a weekend) at each annual time-point. Only recordings 
that captured at least four days monitoring (each of at least nine hours wear time) were 
included in the analyses, as this has been shown to be the minimum required to achieve 
>70% reliability.16 The Actigraph records the intensity of movement every 1/10th of a second,

and for this study the counts were collected into epochs of one minute and stored against 
clock time. Periods of noncompliance reported by the parents, and periods recording 0 cpm 
for ≥17 consecutive minutes (assumed to be unreported noncompliance) were replaced with 
the mean accelerometer counts recorded at the same clock time on the remaining days of 
the recording week. The sensitivity of each accelerometer was measured under controlled 
conditions by a motorized turntable.17 
 
Resting energy expenditure (REE) REE was measured annually, during the week prior to PA 
and on the same day as anthropometry, by indirect calorimetry using a ventilated flow-
through hood technique (Gas Exchange Measurement; Nutren Technology Ltd, Manchester, 
UK). Performance tests report a mean error of 0.3% ± 2.0% in the measurement of oxygen 
consumption and 1.8% ± 1% in that of carbon dioxide production.18 The recording was 
rejected if the calibration test lay outwith the range 20.90-20.99% O2. The children were 
fasted overnight, and measured at around 9 am in all cases. They were given a “settling in” 
period of up to 10 minutes under the hood before data collection over a minimum of 10, 
usually 15, minutes, once the minute-long readings had stabilised. Any one-minute interval 
during which the recorded REE lay two SD or more above the child's overall mean was 
ignored. We have referred throughout the text to absolute REE and to relative REE, which is 
absolute REE adjusted for tissue mass. 
 
Body composition Whole body dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans were 
performed with the Lunar Prodigy Advance fan beam densitometer on the same day as 
anthropometry and REE, and analysed using EnCore 2004 software version 8.10.027 GE 
(Lunar Corporation, Madison WI, USA). We were particularly concerned to record fat mass 
(FM) and fat-free (lean) mass (LM). CVs for body composition analysis using this system 
have been reported to range from 0.18-1.97% among paediatric subjects.19 
 
Tanner stage From 9y, each child (and their parent in the early years) was shown line 
drawings representing genital development for boys, breast development for girls, and pubic 
hair development for both, and asked to choose the picture for each that most closely 
matched their own development. The drawings have been validated,20 and agree, to within 
one Tanner stage, by 76% with clinical assessment of genital development (kappa 0.48), 
and by 88% with pubic hair development (kappa 0.68).  A mean score for both Tanner 
measures (genital/breast and pubic hair development) was calculated at each age. TS1 
represents pre-puberty (no phenotypic change), TS2 early puberty (first phenotypic change), 
TS3 mid puberty, TS4 late puberty, TS5 the end of puberty (adult phenotype).

Height velocity Annual height velocity was calculated from serial overlapping six-month 
height measurements in order to establish the growth pattern of the cohort, and age at peak 
height velocity (APHV). Although we incorporated Tanner Stage in the models, APHV is 
arguably a more objective and metabolic measure of adolescent development, and was 
included for these reasons. 
 
Statistics  
All children age 7-16y were considered for analysis, and all analyses were carried out in 
statistical software package Stata version 14.1 (StataCorp. 2015. Stata Statistical Software: 
Release 14. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP). Three separate linear mixed effect models 
were developed. The first (M-1) considered PA (cpm/day) as the outcome variable, and BMI, 
gender and age as explanatory variables. A random coefficient model was developed that 
permitted each child random intercepts from repeated measurements, and age-related 
random slopes for PA. A log likelihood ratio test suggested that the random coefficient model 
was significantly better than a random intercept model (𝜒2 75.48, p<0.001). The strength of 
maximum likelihood (ML) based algorithms for mixed effect models lies in their ability to 
accommodate missing data points, as the best parameter estimate is derived when the 
likelihood for a probabilistic distribution of the data is at maximum.21 Thus, unlike list-wise 
deletions applied to conventional regression estimators, ML tolerates (within limits) cases 
where outcomes are missing for some points. Accordingly, 322 out of the 347 children 
contributed to the analysis of M-1. M-2 (n=323) modelled REE (kCal/day) as outcome. The 
number of minute-long measurements used for REE was included as a predictor in the 
random intercept model, along with age and gender, to adjust for any variance associated 
with duration of measurement. There was no evidence statistically of random age-related 
slopes for REE, but a random coefficient model with slopes related to minutes measured 
fitted the model significantly better than the random intercept model (𝜒2 18.11, p<0.001). M-
3 (n=320) was similar to M-2 except for further adjustments to lean mass (Kg), fat mass (Kg) 
and APHV, allowing examination of the impact of lean/fat mass on the relationship between 
age and REE. The random slope related variance exhibited in the previous model (M-2) 
disappeared when the model was adjusted for lean and fat mass. Accordingly, a random 
intercept model was fitted which was significantly a better fit than a single level model (𝜒2 
64.11, p<0.001). Interaction effects between gender, age and other variables were included 
in the model where appropriate. The relationships between age and PA/REE were not linear, 
so that age was fitted to the 2nd degree higher order polynomial for PA (M-1), and 4th 
degree polynomial for REE (M-2 and M-3). In order to obtain consistent age-related 
estimates for the linear and higher order polynomials, age was centred to its overall mean 
(11.32 y), regardless of gender, to include „zero‟ in its range. Centring age irrespective of

gender did not introduce bias, as the age difference between the genders was negligible 
(mean 0.12y, SD±0.04y).  M-3 was further adjusted for APHV and Tanner stage (both as a 
categorical, and as a continuous predictor), but the effect of Tanner stage became 
insignificant (Tanner stage: p=0.23) once the model was adjusted for lean/fat mass. 
Outcomes and their residuals at both levels were normally distributed. Results for all three 
models are presented with their coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Outcomes 
are predicted and plotted separately in this report in relation to their explanatory variables.  
 
RESULTS 
 
POPULATION STUDIED 
The basic cohort characteristics at ages 7y, 11y and 16y are shown in Table 1, with the 
proportions deemed obese at each age.  
 
Table 1 Basic characteristics of the cohort during the course of the study 
 
Importantly, the age of the cohort was uniform at each visit, with very little variance, and the 
boy‟s ages closely matched those of the girls. The girls were the same height as the boys at 
11y, but significantly shorter by 16y. They were fatter than the boys throughout.  
 
GROWTH VELOCITY (Fig 1a/1b) 
The velocity curves (Fig 1a/1b) show the annualised six-monthly rates of height and weight 
gain in boys and girls. The period of growth acceleration (growth spurt) spanned the interval 
11-15y. Peak height velocity was achieved by 14y in both genders, and peak weight velocity 
by 13y in the girls and by 16y in the boys. Weight appeared to accelerate faster in the boys, 
and height in the girls. 
 
FAT MASS AND LEAN MASS (Fig 1c/1d)  
Fat mass (FM) was systematically higher in the girls, and continued to rise linearly 
throughout puberty (Fig 1c). In contrast, the early rise of FM in boys tended to level off in 
puberty. Lean mass (LM) followed much the same upward trajectory in boys and girls until 
early puberty, when it accelerated in the boys but increased little further in the girls (Fig 1d).

The analyses here are based on the three models established in Table 2. 
 
Voluntary energy expenditure (PA) The behaviour of PA predicted by M-1 is plotted in Fig 2. 
There was a progressive decline in PA from 7y to 16y in both genders, which accelerated 
with age. Girls were systematically less active than boys and their activity declined more 
rapidly with age.

and APHV)

confidence limits 
 
Involuntary energy expenditure (REE) 
 
Fig 3, the key figure in this report, models the age-related trends in REE before (3a) and 
after (3b) adjustment for lean and fat mass. The unadjusted model shows the rise in REE 
expected of growing children,22 but only up to the age of 11y, after which REE fell 
unexpectedly in both genders to the age of 15y, when it started to recover. Yet the interval 
11y-15y was the period of maximum growth (Fig 1 c/d), during which the girls tended to gain 
fat rather than lean, and boys lean rather than fat. Fig 3b (M-3) models the same age-related 
REE after removing the variation in REE attributable to metabolically active tissues (LM and 
FM). Predictably, the rise in REE observed pre-puberty in Fig 3a is lost, as its rise was 
explained by growth. Paradoxically, however, the decline in REE during puberty is now 
more, rather than less pronounced, and could not be ascribed to changing body 
composition. Indeed, none of the variables introduced into the model could explain the fall in 
REE during the period of rapid adolescent growth.

adjustment for fat and lean mass (both models adjusted for Tanner stage, APHV and 
minutes of REE recorded). 
 
INTERACTIONS  
The association between LM and REE weakened with age (Fig 4a and b). Although the 
correlation between them remained positive throughout at each point in time, REE was 
falling over time while LM was rising. Thus, an increase in mean LM in boys of 18kg (girls 
10kg) from 11y to 15y was accompanied by a fall of REE in the age-related model

amounting to 114 kCal/day (girls 284), p<0.001. The adolescent decline in REE was greatest 
among those of highest lean mass (Fig 4c and d), though the interaction with age had 
practically disappeared by 16y. Interaction between age and APHV was significant, 
suggesting a positive association between APHV and REE over the period of time.

b), and of lean mass with the relationship between age and REE (4c and d).  
 
ENERGY CONSERVED DURING PUBERTY  
Voluntary energy expenditure, expressed as the mean of total PA adjusted for BMI, fell by 
~120,000 Actigraph counts/day from age 10-16y in the boys, and by ~130,000 in the girls. 
An equation has been proposed in the past to convert Actigraph counts into calories,15 but 
only in girls of a single age group, so that we have not attempted to use it here. 
 
Involuntary energy expenditure, expressed as the unadjusted mean of REE, fell by ~110 
kCal/day from age 10-15y in the boys, and by ~190kCal/day in the girls. The unadjusted 
figures are drawn from the raw data, so that any fall is offset by the increase in REE 
associated with the cumulative rise in body mass over the same period and the metabolic 
energy expended in driving it. Even then, the net result is a decline in REE. Fig 3b, however, 
models the fall in REE independently of changes in body mass (both lean and fat), and 
reveals the real reduction in intrinsic REE – up to 450 kCal/day over the end of the five year 
period in both genders. 
 
POSSIBLE MECHANISMS 
The following hormones were measured alongside REE and body composition, and each 
was incorporated in turn into the final model shown in Figure 4b: insulin (Diagnostic Products 
Corporation, Los Angeles, CA), IGF1 (University of Surrey, Guildford, UK), LH and FSH 
(Bayer Diagnostics, Newbury, Berkshire, UK), leptin and adiponectin (to 14y, University of 
Glasgow, UK).  
While each showed distinct trends over time, none was able to explain the fall in REE 
independently of body composition, age, gender or maturity (IGF-1, p=0.28; LH, p=0.56; 
FSH, p=0.43; adiponectin, p=0.52). Only fasting insulin (p=0.01) and leptin (p=0.02) 
appeared to have a statistically significant impact on the fall in REE in the final model, but 
their effect size was small, and not sufficient to explain the fall. Thus, a one-unit increase in 
fasting insulin was associated with a 3kCal/day increase in REE (15kCal/day for one

standard deviation). Similarly, a one-unit increase in leptin was associated with a 1kCal 
decline in REE. Neither altered the age-related decline in REE shown in Fig 3b. 
 
 
Discussion 
The data presented here suggest that both voluntary and involuntary energy expenditure 
decline systematically during the pubertal years of rapid growth. Where it has been noted 
before, the decline in REE has been attributed to relative REE (ie REE adjusted for body 
mass), and ascribed to the changes in body composition which characterise puberty.8,11,23 
The decline in absolute REE at a time of rapid growth reported here is counterintuitive, 
because body mass is deemed the single most important determinant of REE. A decline in 
absolute REE implies an intrinsic reduction in energy expenditure of metabolically active 
tissues, one that would conserve energy. Story and Stang estimate that puberty imposes an 
additional 20-30% in energy needs.24 However speculative, we believe that the decline in 
intrinsic energy expenditure shown here may represent a period of programmed energy 
conservation („efficiency savings‟) which has evolved to assure the extra energy needed for 
adolescent growth.  
  
Whatever the interpretation given to the behaviour of absolute REE, we believe that the body 
composition explanation given in the past to the perceived fall in relative REE may not be 
consistent with observation. First, the fall in REE from 10y to 15y was not just relative, but 
absolute. While there may be changes in body composition associated with pubertal growth, 
such that the proportion of energy-spending tissues falls, there is no evidence from any 
source that metabolically active tissue is actually lost, whether lean or fat. Any increase in 
muscle mass relative to other tissues might attenuate the rise in absolute REE associated 
with growth, but could arguably not reduce it. Second, whereas the boys gained substantially 
more lean mass than the girls, their REE declined less. While the rise in lean mass from 12y 
onwards in the boys was likely to have been attributable in large part to muscle, there is little 
corresponding change in lean mass among the girls, whose decline in REE was 
nevertheless greater than the boys‟. The behaviour of REE in boys, compared with that in 
the girls, appears to be the reverse of what is predicted by the body composition hypothesis. 
Most importantly, perhaps, the decline in REE over time remains – indeed, becomes clearer 
– after adjustment for lean mass and fat mass, and is therefore unlikely to be explained by 
either. Rather than reflect changing body composition, we believe these data may reveal 
how the human body adapts to puberty by conserving the energy it needs for rapid growth.

We did not expect the decline in REE, because absolute REE is usually reckoned to 
increase with body mass – and body mass does not merely increase during puberty, it 
accelerates.  However, as we have shown in Fig 4, there is nothing incompatible with a 
correlation that remains positive while the mean of the outcome variable (in this case REE) 
declines. The measures suggest that REE is declining intrinsically, and the small within-
cohort variance in REE compared with the large decline over time that the change is 
systematic. Systematic change in biological systems implies control, and controlled change 
infers that there is survival advantage to be gained. 
 
We do not know what mechanisms are responsible for reducing voluntary activity, or for 
switching down the energy expenditure of metabolically active cells, but the falls in PA and 
REE were profound. We tested a number of candidate hormones that were measured 
alongside REE and body composition, but none was able to explain the fall in REE. We did 
not measure oestrogen levels in EarlyBird because of their random fluctuations in 
adolescent girls, and measurements of testosterone were incomplete. In any event, neither 
appears to be implicated in the control of REE, at least in adults.25  
Growth hormone, and in consequence IGF-1, levels rise from early puberty, but the rise is 
associated with an increase, rather than a fall, in REE which reportedly occurs prior to the 
changes in body composition which might confound it.26 Adiponectin levels are reported to 
be inversely related to REE in adults,27,28 though we were not able in an earlier study to 
show the same relationship in pre-pubertal children.29 Neither of these two studies analysed 
trends. The study by Ruige and colleagues was cross-sectional and applied to adults who 
were either overweight or obese. That of Pannacciulli was also cross-sectional, and confined 
to Pima Indians. In the present study, adiponectin interacted with age only to the extent that 
it was inversely related to body fat. When body fat was included in the model, the coefficient 
for adiponectin fell and lost its statistical significance.  
There are strengths and weaknesses to this report. The study was longitudinal and, in view 
of its unexpected results, every effort was made to account for confounders. The longitudinal 
design lent itself to mixed effects modelling which can account for missing data and detect 
interactions over time. The uniform age of the cohort (SD ±4m) was crucial to resolving age-
related changes, which were central to the analysis. Blind duplicate measurements of height 
and weight assured optimum precision of the anthropometric measures and AHPV, and 
DEXA provided an objective criterion measure of body composition in both absolute and 
relative terms. However, DEXA could not resolve the components of lean mass, so that we 
cannot be certain how the proportion of each, and of muscle in particular, changed during 
adolescence. The accelerometers we used provided an objective measure of PA, but

recorded only vertical movement, and were unlikely to have recorded fidgeting and 
movement of the upper body while seated. For this reason, we may have underestimated 
voluntary energy expenditure, though sedentary PA contributes little to overall volume. 
Tanner stage was obtained by report, which was inevitable where healthy children are 
concerned, but we place greater store by APHV as an objective measure of adolescent 
development, and incorporated it accordingly. The numbers we studied were relatively small 
by epidemiological standards, but attrition was low (<20% over 10 years), and the multiple 
time points contributed considerable power to the analysis. The population was 98% white 
Caucasian, which optimises homogeneity, but arguably limits generalisibility.  
 
IMPLICATIONS 
The observations reported here seem reliable, and are novel, but our interpretation of them 
is inevitably speculative. Sustained growth requires a positive energy balance, and the 
pubertal dip in REE could represent an evolutionary defence against nutritional pressures 
during transition from childhood into adulthood – a throwback to an era when nutrition was 
limited, but maximum fertility at maturity crucial to survival of the species. If so, the same 
characteristic could have adverse implications for contemporary children, acting 
unfavourably where calories are widely available. The generalised weight gain which we 
described earlier in this cohort as they enter adolescence could in part be attributable to this 
phenomenon.30 Strategies to prevent obesity in children, at its worst among adolescents, 
might take note of this particularly vulnerable period.
