IntroductIon
The healthy central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma is 
void of resident immune cells besides microglia. However, 
there is a full repertoire of resident immune cells, including 
macrophages, T cells, and B cells, in the meningeal spaces. 
Meningeal leukocytes support normal brain function 
(Derecki et al., 2010; Filiano et al., 2016), can drain to local 
lymph nodes (Louveau et al., 2015), and present autoanti-
gens in the context of experimental autoimmune enceph-
alomyelitis (EAE; Kivisäkk et al., 2009), but their activation 
and role after CNS injury are poorly understood.
Injury to the CNS is devastating and often results 
in profound impairment caused by lack of regeneration 
and secondary neuronal death, the progressive loss of neu-
rons not injured by the primary insult (Dusart and Schwab, 
1994). A prominent feature of CNS injury is the immune 
response that starts rapidly and has distinct beneficial ef-
fects on outcome, largely through its effect on second-
ary neuronal damage (Shechter et al., 2009; Gadani et al., 
2015a). The inflammatory cascade begins with release of 
alarm signals (alarmins) that initiate a cellular response. 
We have previously characterized the protein IL-33 as a 
key CNS alarmin that is expressed in healthy glia, is re-
leased after injury, and promotes monocyte recruitment 
(Gadani et al., 2015b).
Interestingly, IL-33 is released into the cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) after spinal cord injury (SCI; Gadani et al., 
2015b), leading to the possibility of it activating meningeal 
cells there. Type 2 innate lymphocytes (ILC2s) are recently 
described tissue-resident cells (Moro et al., 2010; Neill et 
al., 2010; Price et al., 2010; Molofsky et al., 2013) and are 
among the most potent responders to IL-33 in the periph-
ery. Upon interaction with IL-33, ILC2s rapidly produce 
cytokines such as IL-13 and IL-5, initiating and potentiat-
ing type 2 immunity (Van Dyken et al., 2014). In the pe-
riphery, ILC2s are important mediators of antihelminth and 
allergic inflammation (Halim, 2016) and promote healing 
in skin (Rak et al., 2016) and lung (Monticelli et al., 2011) 
injury models. ILC2s have previously been detected in the 
CNS, where they are responsible for gender differences 
in the EAE response of male and female Kit mutant mice 
(Russi et al., 2015), but their presence in the meninges and 
response to CNS injury has not been studied.
Here, we identify ILC2s as a novel meninges-resident 
cell type and characterize their localization, transcriptional 
profile, and response to CNS injury. Meningeal ILC2s are 
concentrated around the dural sinuses and have unique 
transcriptional profiles and basal activation states when 
compared with peripheral (lung) ILC2s. Meningeal ILC2s 
are activated in an IL-33–dependent manner after CNS 
injury. Finally, addition of WT lung-derived ILC2s into 
CSF of IL-33R−/− mice before injury improves functional 
outcome and reduces lesion size after SCI, suggesting that 
these cells play a beneficial post–CNS injury role.
the meningeal space is occupied by a diverse repertoire of immune cells. central nervous system (cnS) injury elicits a rapid 
immune response that affects neuronal survival and recovery, but the role of meningeal inflammation remains poorly under-
stood. Here, we describe type 2 innate lymphocytes (ILc2s) as a novel cell type resident in the healthy meninges that are ac-
tivated after cnS injury. ILc2s are present throughout the naive mouse meninges, though are concentrated around the dural 
sinuses, and have a unique transcriptional profile. After spinal cord injury (ScI), meningeal ILc2s are activated in an IL-33–de-
pendent manner, producing type 2 cytokines. using rnAseq, we characterized the gene programs that underlie the ILc2 acti-
vation state. Finally, addition of wild-type lung-derived ILc2s into the meningeal space of IL-33r−/− animals partially improves 
recovery after ScI. these data characterize ILc2s as a novel meningeal cell type that responds to ScI and could lead to new 
therapeutic insights for neuroinflammatory conditions.

reSuLtS And dIScuSSIon
The meningeal compartment of the CNS hosts a wide va-
riety of immune cells under homeostatic conditions. ILC2s, 
known for their important functions in barrier tissues, had 
previously been implicated in CNS diseases (Besnard et al., 
2015; Russi et al., 2015), but their presence in healthy menin-
ges has not been assessed. 
We asked whether ILC2s are present 
in healthy meninges and surprisingly identified a population 
of CD45+/Lineage−/Thy1.2+/ST2+ cells (Fig. 1 A). Further-
more, this population had a surface marker profile charac-
teristic of ILC2s, expressing C-kit, Sca1, CD25, and IL-7Rα 
(Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, the meninges has more ILC2s rel-
ative to ILC3s (CD45+/singlets/lineage−/viable/RORγ+ 
cells) in the healthy state, and both ILC populations were 
concentrated in the brain rather than spinal cord meninges 
(Fig. 1 C). No ILCs were detected in the healthy spinal cord 
parenchyma (Fig. 1 C).
We next sought to explore the physical localization of 
ILC2s in brain and spinal cord meninges. T
o that end, we 
crossed the 
Y
et-Cre 13 (Price et al., 2010) and tdT
omatostoplox 
mice, generating a new model where any cell that expressed 
IL-13 is permanently labeled with tdT
omato (IL-13tdt mice). 
This strategy labels the majority of ILC2s in healthy brain/
spinal cord meninges and lung (Fig. 1, D and E) and also labels 
populations of T cells and mast cells in these tissues (Fig. 1, 
F and G). A whole mount of IL-13tdt dura mater revealed a 
concentration of tdT
omato expression in the transverse and 
sagittal dural sinuses, which drain venous blood from the 
brain (Fig. S1 A). T
o differentiate tdT
omato+ ILC2s from T 
cells and mast cells, we costained IL-13tdt meninges with CD3 
and toluidine blue to identify T cells and mast cells, respec-
tively. ILC2s were identified as tdT
omato+/CD3−/toluidine 
blue− cells in dural sinus, dura mater, and spinal cord menin-
ges whole mounts (Fig. 1, H–J). ILC2s were heavily concen-
trated in the dural sinus and found more sparsely throughout 
the dura mater and spinal cord meninges (Fig. 1 K).
It has previously been noted that ILC2s expand in re-
sponse to IL-33 stimulation (Molofsky et al., 2013), and, to 
further confirm the nature of the newly identified menin-
geal cells, we sought to repeat this observation in meningeal 
ILC2s. Indeed, mice treated with IL-33 i.p. for 6 d had up 
to 3.5-fold expansion of ILC2s in the spinal cord and brain 
meninges (Fig. 1, L–N).
Given the unique localization of brain meningeal 
ILC2s, we characterized them transcriptionally to assess their 
degree of similarity with other ILC2s, choosing to compare 
them with the well-studied population of ILC2s in the lung. 
ILC2s were FACs purified from meninges and lung, and 
>90% pure ILC2s were used for RNAseq analysis. Among 
the top genes expressed by meningeal ILC2s are numerous 
canonical markers, including the Il-2rα, Il-7r, and Il1rl1 (IL-
33R; Fig. 2 A and Table S1). T
o assess the similarity of highly 
expressed genes in meningeal and lung ILC2s, we compared 
the genes expressed at least 1.5 standard deviations above the 
mean between the cell types. As predicted, the majority of 
highly expressed genes are common between lung and men-
ingeal ILC2s, but there are also discreet sets of genes delin-
eating them (Fig. 2 B). We identified 472 significantly altered 
genes between the groups (adjusted p-value <0.05; Fig. 2 C 
and Table S2). Interestingly, the majority of these genes were 
up-regulated in lung relative to meningeal ILC2s (Fig. 2 C). 
T
o describe functional consequences of this differential ex-
pression, we identified gene sets enriched among our differ-
entially expressed genes (Table S2). Among the enriched gene 
sets were several relating to inflammation, signal transduction, 
and metabolism, suggesting an increased basal activation state 
in lung relative to meningeal ILC2s (Fig. 2, D and E). The 
basis for these differences is somewhat unclear. Lung ILC2s 
are exposed to far more environmental irritants and stimuli 
than meningeal ILC2s, likely leading to the observed alter-
nations in transcription. Furthermore, meningeal ILC2s are 
proximal to the brain, an exceptionally sensitive tissue, and 
therefore, a relatively quiescent rest state could be optimal for 
healthy brain function.
IL-33 is a potent stimulus for ILC2s and is released in 
abundance into the CSF after SCI (Gadani et al., 2015b). 
We therefore tested whether meningeal ILC2s are acutely 
activated after SCI. T
ype 2 cytokine production is a hall-
mark of ILC2 activation, and using the YET
-cre 13 mouse 
(which have YFP expressed under the IL-13 promoter), we 
compared IL-13 induction in uninjured and 1 d post-injury 
(1DPI) ILC2s, finding increased YFP expression in brain but 
not spinal cord meningeal ILC2s (Fig. 3 A). We repeated this 
observation using intracellular antibody staining, finding that 
brain meningeal but not spinal cord meningeal ILC2s have 
increased production of IL-13 and IL-5 at 1DPI (Fig. 3, B 
and C). Finally, we tested whether brain meningeal ILC2 
cytokine production is IL-33 dependent using the IL-33−/− 
mice. IL-33−/− animals show no significant up-regulation of 
IL-13 or IL-5 relative to uninjured animals (Fig. 3, D and E).
Brain meningeal ILC2s respond to spinal cord–derived 
signals after injury with increased cytokine production, and 
we next characterized the transcriptome of SCI-activated 
meningeal ILC2s by RNAseq. We measured global tran-
scriptomic changes in brain meningeal ILC2s 1 d after SCI, 
finding numerous up- and down-regulated genes (Fig. 3 F 
and Table S3). Among genes up-regulated after injury are 
immune checkpoint genes, such as Pdcd1, receptors, such 
as Tnfrsf 9, Gpr35, and Il18r1, and those involved in neuro-
protection, such as Calca (encoding calcitonin gene-related 
peptide [CGRP]) and the shuttle for its receptor Ramp3 
(Fig. 3 F). CGRP is known to be rapidly up-regulated in 
the injured CNS (Bulloch et al., 1998; Ackery et al., 2007) 
and is involved in regeneration of peripheral nerves (Blesch 
and Tuszynski, 2001; T
oth et al., 2009). Notably, expression 
of Il1rl1 (encoding ST2), Il5, and Il13 were unchanged after 
injury. The lack of measured difference in IL-5 and IL-13 
mRNA could represent the transient nature of their up-reg-
ulation in this system. Although the 
Y
et-cre reporter demon-
strated increased YFP
, and thus IL-13 promoter activity at

1DPI, it is possible that increases in IL-13 mRNA are out-
lived by the 
YFP reporter.
We next identified gene sets enriched in meningeal 
ILC2s isolated from uninjured versus injured mice. Several 
inflammatory gene networks were enriched in ILC2s after 
injury, including TNF signaling, IL-2 signaling, biosynthetic 
processes, and general cell activation (Fig. 3, G and H; and 
Table S3). Interestingly, several of the same genes and gene 
sets were up-regulated in meningeal ILC2s after injury and 
lung ILC2s. Extracting sufficient RNA for analysis from 
meningeal ILC2s required pooling five mice per sample, and 
we therefore chose to validate results using RNAseq repli-
cates instead of individual gene qPCR. RNAseq replicates 
were collected on different days, and only genes/gene sets 
consistently different across samples were accepted.
ILC2s are known to accumulate at injury sites in the 
periphery (Rak et al., 2016), but the capacity for ILC2 mi-
gration into inflamed sites is poorly understood. Given that 
the healthy CNS parenchyma is void of ILC2s (Fig. 1 C), we 
reasoned that if ILC2s accumulate at the SCI site, some of 
them must have migrated there. We used the IL-13tdt mouse 
to identify ILC2s that have infiltrated the lesion site, find-
ing that they migrate to the injury site by 10DPI (Fig. 4 A). 
Using flow cytometry, we performed a time course of ILC2 
numbers in the SCI site. ILC2s were detectable in the injury 
site by 3DPI, but numbers maximized at 10DPI and persisted 
through 30DPI (Fig. 4 B). Notably, these cells were compe-
tent to produce IL-13 (Fig. 4 C). This migration was IL-33 
independent, as IL-33−/− and WT mice had similar ILC2 in-
filtration at 10DPI (Fig. 4 D).
Finally, we sought to test the functional impact ILC2s 
have on recovery from CNS injury. We pursued a global ILC 
depletion strategy: Rag1−/− animals, lacking T and B cells but 
having Thy1.2+ ILCs, were reconstituted with Thy1.1 lym-
phocytes. In this mouse, reconstituted lymphocytes will bear 
a different isoform Thy1 than endogenous ILCs. We then 
injected mice with a Thy1.2-depleting antibody, targeting 
ILCs without affecting lymphocytes, as had been previously 
performed in literature (Monticelli et al., 2011; Gorski et al., 
2013). There was no significant effect of depleting ILCs in 
this way on SCI outcome (Fig. S2 A); however, the depletion 
strategy was actually found to be ineffective for meninges. 
Anti-Thy1.2 did not deplete meningeal ILCs, but instead 
only blocked the 
Thy1 epitope (Fig. S2, B and C). Our obser-
vation should also serve as a caution against validating deple-
tion by staining for the antigen used to deplete.
We next pursued the converse experiment: adding back 
ILC2s into the CSF before injury. Meningeal ILC2s are sparse, 
and it is not feasible to extract sufficient numbers for recon-
stitution. Given their relative abundance and increased basal 
activity profiles, we used lung-derived ILC2s for adoptive 
transfer experiments. ILC2 cytokine production is dependent 
on IL-33, and to restrict IL-33’s actions only to our trans-
ferred cells, we used ST2−/− recipients. 5,000 FACS-purified, 
lung-derived ILC2s were injected into the cisterna magna of 
ST2−/− mice 1 d before SCI. This moderate increase in ILC2 
numbers had a significant beneficial effect on functional 
recovery, as measured by Basso mouse scale (BMS) score, a 
behavior score widely used to assess functional outcome of 
SCI in mice (Fig. 4 E). Additionally, we measured the volume 
size of the lesions, and as expected from BMS scores, ILC2-
treated mice had smaller lesion volumes than control mice 
(Fig. 4, F and G). Lung ILC2s were selected based on their 
availability and activation profile, which includes elevated im-
munomodulatory and neuroprotective gene expression. It is 
important to realize that in using these cells, we may have 
tilted the balance in favor of recovery and that reconstitution 
with more meningeal ILC2s would be required to achieve 
the same benefit. Alternatively, meningeal ILC2s may be spe-
cialized to support the injured CNS through unidentified 
mechanisms, in which case our reconstitution underestimates 
the true impact of ILC2s on SCI.
The meningeal space represents a largely unstudied 
venue for neuroimmune interactions in the healthy and dis-
eased CNS conditions. 
This area is densely populated by a va-
riety of immune cells, some resident (Goldmann et al., 2016)

and other patrolling (Radjavi et al., 2014). The recent dis-
covery of meningeal lymphatic vessels (Aspelund et al., 2015; 
Louveau et al., 2015) has shed a new light on the importance 
of the meningeal space in the neuroimmune axis. Meningeal 
immunity is unique as it exhibits an obvious predominance of 
type 2 inflammation (Derecki et al., 2010) for reasons that are 
not fully understood yet. Moreover, after SCI, type 2 immune 
responses are intensified and required for improved outcome 
(Walsh et al., 2015). One of the immediate cells responding to 
injuries in peripheral/barrier tissues are ILC2s. Here, we pro-
vide the first evidence for a meningeal population of ILC2s, 
demonstrating their abundance in the brain meninges and 
characterizing them transcriptionally. 
We further studied their 
response to SCI, demonstrating that after injury, meningeal 
ILC2s are functionally activated, and they enter the injury 
site and improve recovery.
Our finding of differential gene expression from brain 
and lung further suggests that ILC2 phenotype could be 
determined, at least in part, by tissue of residence. Indeed, 
diverse tissue-dependent ILC2 functions have already been 
described in tissues such as adipose (Molofsky et al., 2013; 
Odegaard et al., 2016). Of note, lung ILC2s had up-regula-
tion of numerous inflammatory gene sets relative to menin-
ges, possibly because of continuous exposure of these cells to 
environmental irritants and stimuli. The extent of plasticity 
between and diversity of roles for putative ILC2 phenotypes 
remains an important topic for future study.
After SCI, meningeal ILC2s are activated, producing 
type 2 cytokines and up-regulating inflammatory gene sets. 
Among the most prominently up-regulated genes are Calca, 
encoding CGRP
, and Ramp3, encoding shuttling protein for 
its receptor. CGRP is up-regulated in the CNS after injury 
(Bulloch et al., 1998; Ackery et al., 2007) and has been im-
plicated in regeneration of sensory neurons in and out of the 
CNS (Blesch and 
Tuszynski, 2001; 
T
oth et al., 2009), migraine 
pain (Russo, 2015), and immunomodulation (Bracci-Laud-
iero et al., 2005). Previous studies have noted CGRP receptor 
expression in ILC2s, suggesting that they may detect CGRP 
secreted by nociceptive neurons (Saenz et al., 2013; Talbot et 
al., 2015). Our results identify CGRP as a novel factor poten-
tially released by activated ILC2s.
This study is an early foray into the biology of men-
ingeal ILC2s and demonstrates a novel role for meningeal 
immune cells as sentinels for CNS-derived alarmins. IL-33 
released after CNS injury not only initiates a local response, 
but also a meningeal one through actions on ILC2s. ILC2s 
produce IL-13, both in the meninges and at the injury site, 
which could promote the generation of neuroprotective 
Th2 cells—or directly boost survival of neurons (Walsh et 
al., 2015). Many other potentially neuroprotective factors, in-
cluding Areg, Vegfa, Il1b, and Calca (Blesch and Tuszynski, 
2001; Diem et al., 2003; Sun et al., 2003; Zhan et al., 2015) 
could also contribute to the beneficial effect of lung-derived 
ILC2 transfer. Further studies are required to fully under-
stand this meningeal ILC2 response and the mechanism by 
which adding ILC2s is beneficial after injury. Furthermore, 
meningeal ILC2s, given their perivenous localization, could 
be first responders in gut–brain communication. This study 
provides insight into a novel immune cell player after CNS 
injury, the meningeal ILC2, and further work on this popu-
lation could lead to therapeutic insights for injury and other 
neurological disorders.

Mice
IL-33−/− mice were generated by the trans-NIH Knock-
Out Mouse Project (KOMP) and obtained from the KOMP 
repository. ST2−/− mice were generated in the laboratory 
of A. McKenzie (University of Cambridge, Cambridge, 
England, UK) and were a gift from P
. Bryce (Northwestern 
University, Evanston, IL). Yet-Cre 13 mice were generated 
by and a gift from R. Locksley (University of California, 
San Francisco, San Francisco, CA; Price et al., 2010). C57/
Bl6 and tdTomatostoplox mice were obtained from the Jack-
son Laboratory, stock #004999 and #007905, respectively. 
All transgenic lines were on the C57/Bl6 genetic back-
ground except for Yet-Cre 13, which was BALB/c. The 
F1 generation of Yet-Cre 13 × tdTomatostoplox crosses was 
used. All animals were housed in temperature- and hu-
midity-controlled rooms, maintained on a 12-h light/dark 
cycle (lights on 7:00 a.m.), and age matched in each ex-
periment. All strains were kept in identical housing condi-
tions. For survival surgeries, mice were anesthetized with 
either 200 µl of ketamine/xylazine (1 ml ketamine HCl 
[1 mg/ml], 1 ml of 2% xylazine, 8 ml saline) or inhaled 
isoflurane. All procedures complied with regulations of the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IAC 
UC) 
at the University of 
Virginia (UVA).

sected, minced, and digested for 30 min in RPMI + 1.4 U/ml 
 
Collagenase 
VIII + 1 mg/ml DNase1 at 37°C. Digested me-
ninges and lung were dissociated by pipetting and passed 
through 70-µm filters. Spinal cords were dissected from 
PBS-perfused mice, and 1 cm of cord centered on the lesion 
was isolated, minced, and digested in RPMI + 4 U/ml papain 
+ 1 mg/ml DNase1 for 20 min. Spinal cords were triturated 
with small- and large-bore fire-polished pipette and passed 
through a 70-µm filter. Samples were washed in FACs buffer 
(PBS, 0.05% Na Azide, 1 mM EDTA, 2% FBS) and stained 
with antibody cocktail and viability dye for 30 min at 4°C 
in FACs buffer. For lineage staining, cells were labeled with 
biotinylated lineage antibody cocktail, washed, and then in-
cubated with strepdavidin-PeCy7 or -Fitc (eBioscience) for 
30 min at 4°C. Zombie aqua fixable viability dye (BioLeg-
end) was used to discriminate live cell populations. T
o ob-
tain absolute cell counts, counting beads (eBioscience) were 
added to the samples. After staining, samples were washed 
in FACs buffer and resuspended in 4% PFA. The following 
antibodies were used (all from eBioscience unless otherwise 
noted): CD45-af700, Lineage-biotin (CD11b, B220, CD3, 
GR1, TER-119, FcεRα), Thy1.2-Fitc, ST2-Pe, C-kit–ef780, 
Sca1-af700, CD25-APC, TCRβ-Fitc or APCCy7, IL-7R–Pe, 
C-kit–ef7Pe, ICO 
SL-APC, Gata3-660, Rorγt, IL-13–PeCy7, 
IL-5–Pe, and CD69-PeCy7.
T
o stain intranuclear antigens (Gata3, Rorγt, IL-13, IL-5), 
cells were fixed after extracellular staining with Cytofix/Cy-
toperm (BD), washed in perm buffer, and stained for 30 min 
at room temperature. Samples were read on a Gallios cytom-
eter (Beckman Coulter) and analyzed using FlowJo software 
(Tree Star). ILC2s (selected as CD45+/Lineage−/Thy1.2+/
ST2+ cells) were sorted on an Influx cell sorter (BD) in the 
UVA flow cytometry core facility, achieving a purity of >90%.
rnA sequencing and analysis
ILC2s were FACs sorted, as described above, directly into lysis 
buffer (PicoPure RNA isolation kit; Applied Biosystems). 
RNA purification was performed according to manufacturer 
instructions and stored at −80°C until use. Library prepa-
ration, amplification, and RNA sequencing (Illumina) were 
performed by HudsonAlpha.
In vitro cell stimulation
For in vitro stimulation and cytokine staining of ILC2s, nor-
malized numbers of cells were maintained in RPMI + 10% 
FBS + Anti-anti at 37°C. Cells were treated with Golgi block 
(Brefeldin A) and stimulated with PMA/ionomycin for 4 h 
before being washed and stained as described in the Flow 
cytometry/cell sorting section.
Image quantification
Images were acquired using an SP8 confocal microscope 
(Leica; fluorescence images) or a DMI 6000B widefield 
microscope (Leica; brightfield images). Counting was done 
in ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) with the “Cell 
Counter” plugin (Kurt De 
Vos, University of Sheffield, Shef-
field, England, UK). Heat maps were generated with the 
“HeatMap Histogram” plugin (Samuel Péan).
T
o quantify spinal cord lesion size, 20-µm coronal sec-
tions were stained with GFAP and imaged. Lesion area per 
slice was quantified using ImageJ, and total volume was cal-
culated using Excel (Microsoft).
tissue preparation and immunofluorescence
For quantification of ILC2s, mice were perfused with hepa-
rinized (5 U/ml) PBS and 4% PFA, followed by meninges and 
spinal cord dissection. The tissue was postfixed for 48 h in 4% 
PFA, and spinal cords were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for 
48 h. Spinal cords were cut into 20-µm sections, mounted on 
gelatin-coated slides, and stored at −20°C until use. T
o stain, 
tissue was blocked for 1 h at room temperature in blocking 
buffer (2% serum [of the secondary’s species]; 1% BSA; 0.1% 
triton; 0.05% tween; 0.05% Na Azide) followed by overnight 
incubation in primary antibody at 4°C. The following anti-
bodies were used for immunofluorescence staining: chicken 
anti-GFAP (AB5541; 1:1,000; EMD Millipore), rat anti-CD3 
660 (50-0032; 1:300; eBioscience), rat anti-CD3 biotin (13-
0032; 1:300; eBioscience). Slices were washed 3× 10 min and 
incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the appropri-
ate secondary antibodies (all from Thermo Fisher Scientific; 
1:1,000), washed again 3 × 10 min and mounted with Aqua-
Mount (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and DAPI.

Spinal cord contusion
Female mice were first anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine. 
The back fur was shaved and underlying skin sterilized with 
an iodide/betadine solution. An incision was made over the 
T9-T10 vertebrae, and the skin was held back with retrac-
tors. The fascia overlying the spinal cord was removed to ex-
pose the vertebrae. The T10 vertebra was removed with fine 
rongeurs to expose the spinal cord. The IH-0400 Impactor 
(Precision Systems and Instrumentation) was used to contuse 
the spinal cord centrally, after which the muscles and skin 
overlying the spinal cord were sutured closed and the mouse 
was allowed to recover on warming pads. The force of impact 
was computer controlled and set to 70 or 90 KDyn as noted 
in the text/legends. Mice were maintained on sulfa water, 
and twice daily we performed manual bladder expulsion. 
T
wo 
blinded observers assessed recovery of hind-limb locomotor 
activity with the BMS (Basso et al., 2006) after injury.
IL-33 treatment
For IL-33 treatments to expand ILC2s, mice were injected 
i.p. with 500 ng carrier-free recombinant IL-33 (eBioscience) 
every other day. After three injections, mice were sacrificed, 
and ILC2 numbers were analyzed by flow cytometry.
rnAseq analysis
The raw sequencing reads (FAS 
TQ files) went through two 
stages of preprocessing to remove low-quality reads and bases. 
First, they were chastity filtered, which removes any clusters 
that have a higher than expected intensity of the called base 
compared with other bases. Then they were trimmed with 
Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014) to remove low-quality 
bases (minimum read length after trimming = 36). After 
preprocessing, the quality of the reads was evaluated using 
FastQC, and after passing quality control (QC), the reads were 
aligned to the UCSC mm9 genome (Harrow et al., 2012) 
using the splice-aware read aligner STAR (Dobin et al., 2013). 
The quality of the alignments was next assessed by SAMStat 
(Lassmann et al., 2011), and any low-quality alignments were 
removed with SAMtools (Li et al., 2009; MAPQ < 10). Next, 
the number of reads aligning to each gene was quantified 
with HTSeq (Anders et al., 2015), and then the Bioconductor 
package (Love et al., 2014) DESeq2 was used to normalize 
the raw counts and perform exploratory analysis (e.g., PCA) 
and differential expression analysis. The Benjamini–Hochberg 
false discovery rate procedure was used to correct the p-values 
for multiple testing. Heat maps of the differentially expressed 
genes generated with the R package pheatmap (https 
://
CRAN 
.R 
-project 
.org 
/package 
=pheatmap). T
o compare the 
highly expressed genes in the uninjured lung versus uninjured 
brain meninges, the normalized, log2 transformed counts were 
converted to standard scores (z-score) using the scale function 
in R. 
The mean z-score for each gene was then calculated, and 
those with a z-score >1.5 (i.e., 1.5 standard deviations above the 
mean) were considered highly expressed. 
The UpSet plot (Lex 
et al., 2014) used to visualize the overlap between the uninjured 
lung and brain samples was created with the R package UpSetR 
(Gehlenborg, 2016). The R implementation of Fisher’s exact 
test, fisher.test, was used to identify enriched gene sets in the 
differentially expressed genes using two gene set collections: 
the GO biological process from MSigDB (Subramanian 
et al., 2005; C5) and the gene families from the Hugo Gene 
Nomenclature Committee (HGNC; Gray et al., 2015).

online supplemental material
Fig. S1 contains images of whole-mount IL-13tdt meninges, 
demonstrating visually how ILC2s are concentrated in the 
dural sinus area. Fig. S2 contains data regarding the use of an-
ti-Thy1.2 antibody to deplete ILC2s, demonstrating that, in 
our hands, it merely blocks the Thy1.2 epitope. Table S1 lists 
normalized gene expression values for all RNAseq samples 
(uninjured and injured meninges and uninjured lung ILC2s). 
Table S2 lists differential expression between uninjured me-
ninges and lung ILC2s, as well as the gene sets enriched in 
lung ILC2s. Table S3 lists differential expression between 
uninjured and injured meninges ILC2s, as well as the gene 
sets enriched in injured meninges ILC2s. Tables S1–S3 are 
available as Excel files.
