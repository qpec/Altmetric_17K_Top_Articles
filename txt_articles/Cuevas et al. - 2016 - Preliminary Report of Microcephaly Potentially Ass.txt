On December 9, 2016, this report was posted as an MMWR 
Early Release on the MMWR website (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr). 
In Colombia, approximately 105,000 suspected cases of 
Zika virus disease (diagnosed based on clinical symptoms, 
regardless of laboratory confirmation) were reported dur-
ing August 9, 2015–November 12, 2016, including nearly 
20,000 in pregnant women (1,2). Zika virus infection dur-
ing pregnancy is a known cause of microcephaly and serious 
congenital brain abnormalities and has been associated with 
other birth defects related to central nervous system damage 
(3). Colombia’s Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS) maintains 
national surveillance for birth defects, including microcephaly 
and other central nervous system defects. This report provides 
preliminary information on cases of congenital microcephaly 
identified in Colombia during epidemiologic weeks 5–45 
(January 31–November 12) in 2016. During this period, 
476 cases of microcephaly were reported, compared with 110 
cases reported during the same period in 2015. The temporal 
association between reported Zika virus infections and the 
occurrence of microcephaly, with the peak number of reported 
microcephaly cases occurring approximately 24 weeks after 
the peak of the Zika virus disease outbreak, provides evidence 
suggesting that the period of highest risk is during the first 
trimester of pregnancy and early in the second trimester of 
pregnancy. Microcephaly prevalence increased more than 
fourfold overall during the study period, from 2.1 per 10,000 
live births in 2015 to 9.6 in 2016. Ongoing population-based 
birth defects surveillance is essential for monitoring the impact 
of Zika virus infection during pregnancy on birth defects 
prevalence and measuring the success in preventing Zika virus 
infection and its consequences, including microcephaly.
INS maintains ongoing passive, national surveillance in 
Colombia for both symptomatic Zika virus disease and major 
birth defects. Surveillance for Zika virus disease based on clini-
cal symptoms and laboratory testing started in August 2015 
in Colombia, and following a cluster of laboratory-confirmed 
cases of Zika virus disease, immediate mandatory reporting 
began in October 2015. At the time, symptomatic Zika virus 
disease was defined as illness with fever and at least one addi-
tional symptom (rash, nonpurulent conjunctivitis, headache, 
pruritus, arthralgia, myalgia, or malaise) of unknown etiology. 
Beginning December 24, 2015, the case definition has included 
both fever and rash, and at least one of the other symptoms. 
Colombia’s birth defects surveillance system includes reporting 
of microcephaly (International Classification of Disease, 10th 
Revision code Q02) among live births and pregnancy losses 
(including spontaneous abortions, pregnancy terminations, 
and stillbirths) from all reporting areas.* Congenital micro-
cephaly in a newborn is defined as having a head circumference 
below the third percentile for gestational age and sex. The 
following clinical specimens are requested for all infants and 
fetuses with microcephaly to ascertain whether the mother was 
infected with Zika virus during pregnancy: maternal serum, 
infant serum from cord and peripheral blood specimens, cere-
brospinal fluid (if obtained from infant for clinical reasons), 
and tissues from fetal losses. Specimens are tested for Zika 
virus RNA by real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain 
reaction (rRT-PCR), for serologic evidence of infection by Zika 
immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody capture enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA), or for Zika viral antigens 
by immunohistochemistry, as well as for the presence of other 
infections (syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, 
herpes simplex, and other agents); high resolution karyotyping 
is also performed. The Colombian Ministry of Health recom-
mends a diagnostic algorithm for testing of specimens from all 
products of conception and infants whose mothers had Zika 
virus infection during pregnancy; however, these specimens 
are not always collected soon after birth or submitted for Zika 
virus testing. Recommended neuroimaging includes cranial 
ultrasound for all infants, and if abnormalities are observed 
on cranial ultrasound then computed tomography scan or 
magnetic resonance imaging might be necessary. Microcephaly 
prevalence per 10,000 live births was calculated overall, by 
reporting area, and by month of pregnancy completion for 
epidemiologic weeks 5–45 in 2016. A prevalence ratio (PR) was 
calculated by dividing the prevalence in 2016 by the prevalence 
in 2015, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the PR were 
calculated using Poisson regression.

* Pregnant women with Zika virus disease include women with symptoms of Zika virus disease, regardless of laboratory confirmation; epidemiologic week was based 
on date of symptom onset. Immediate mandatory reporting of clinical symptoms of Zika virus disease with laboratory testing began in Colombia in October 2015. 
During October–December 23, 2015, symptomatic Zika virus disease was defined as fever and at least one additional symptom (rash, nonpurulent conjunctivitis, 
headache, pruritus, arthralgia, myalgia, or malaise). Beginning December 24, 2015, it was defined as fever and rash with at least one of the other symptoms.
† Congenital microcephaly in a newborn is defined as head circumference less than the third percentile, compared with the normal standard adjusted for gestational 
age and sex; epidemiologic week was based on the date of birth or pregnancy loss.
The outbreak of Zika virus disease among pregnant women 
in Colombia peaked during epidemiologic week 4 in 2016. 
Reported cases of microcephaly peaked during epidemio-
logic week 28 in 2016 (24 weeks after the peak of reported 
cases of Zika virus disease) (Figure 1). During epidemiologic 
weeks 5–45 in 2016, a total of 476 infants with microcephaly 
were reported in Colombia; 28 (85%) of the 33 reporting 
areas in Colombia reported at least one case of microcephaly 
(supplemental table https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/42918). 
Overall, the prevalence of reported microcephaly was approxi-
mately 9.6 per 10,000 live births. Among areas reporting at 
least one case of microcephaly, the prevalence ranged from two 
per 10,000 live births (Nariño and Quindío) to 29 (Amazonas) 
(Figure 2). Microcephaly cases were reported in areas that 
include locations >2000 meters (6,562 feet) above sea level 
(e.g., Bogotá) without active Zika virus transmission; these 
cases, if Zika-related, likely resulted from travel-associated or 
sexually transmitted Zika virus infections.
The prevalence of microcephaly increased more than fourfold 
during epidemiologic weeks 5–45 in 2016 compared with the 
same period in 2015 (PR = 4.5) (Table). Peak prevalence of 
microcephaly was registered in July 2016, when the prevalence 
was ninefold higher than in July 2015 (PR = 9.0). In 2016, 
among all microcephaly cases, 432 (91%) occurred in live 
born infants, and 44 (9%) occurred among pregnancy losses; 
in 2015, among 110 reported cases of microcephaly, 90 (82%) 
occurred in live born infants, and 20 (18%) occurred among 
pregnancy losses.

Among the 476 infants and fetuses with microcephaly 
reported during epidemiologic weeks 5–45 in 2016, a total 
of 306 (64%) were tested for Zika virus infection; 147 (48%) 
had laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection by RT-PCR or 
immunohistochemistry on any placental, fetal, or infant speci-
men, and five of six tested had serologic evidence of infection by 
MAC-ELISA. Among 121 infants tested for other pathogens, 
26 (21%) had evidence of infection with other pathogens, 
including toxoplasmosis (15 infants), herpes simplex (six), cyto-
megalovirus (four) and syphilis (one); among these 26 infants, 
17 (65%) had evidence of coinfection with Zika virus (14 of 
15 with toxoplasmosis, two of six with herpes, and one of four 
with cytomegalovirus). Neuroimaging results 
were available for 32% of all microcephaly 
cases. Among 476 infants or fetuses with micro-
cephaly, mothers of 164 (34%) reported having 
symptoms compatible with Zika virus infection 
during pregnancy.
Discussion
Based on an average full term gestation, the 
24-week period from the peak of the Zika 
virus outbreak to the peak in reported micro-
cephaly occurrence suggests that the greatest 
risk for microcephaly is associated with Zika 
virus infection during the first trimester and 
early in the second trimester of pregnancy. 
During epidemiologic weeks 5–45, there was 
more than a fourfold increase in reported 
microcephaly cases in Colombia in 2016, 
compared with the previous year. Although 
the microcephaly prevalence in 2016 among 
infants likely exposed to Zika virus in utero 
(9.6 per 10,000 live births) in Colombia was 
not much higher than the median of micro-
cephaly prevalence (6.6 per 10,000 live births) 
reported by passive surveillance in 17 U.S. 
states during 2009–2013 (4), the comparison 
with 2015 Colombia data indicates the mag-
nitude of the increase.
The Zika virus disease outbreak in the World 
Health Organization’s Region of the Americas 
began in Brazil, which first reported a labora-
tory-confirmed Zika virus outbreak in May 
2015; Colombia confirmed local transmission 
of Zika virus about 5 months later, in October 
2015.† In 2015, microcephaly prevalence in 
Brazil was 5.5 per 10,000 live births, represent-
ing an approximate ninefold increase over the 
average prevalence during the previous 14 years 
(5,6). In Colombia, the relative increase has 
been smaller (fourfold); however, the baseline microcephaly 
prevalence was 2.1 per 10,000 live births in 2015, at least three 
times higher than Brazil’s reported baseline. There are several 
possible reasons for differences between the reported baseline 
microcephaly prevalences in Brazil and Colombia, as well as 
the differences in increases of microcephaly in the context of 
the Zika virus outbreaks in the two countries. First, 50%–75% 
of the population of Colombia reside at altitudes above 2,000

* Congenital microcephaly in a newborn is defined as head circumference less than the third percentile, compared with the normal standard adjusted for gestational 
age and sex. Table includes pregnancies ending during this period, regardless of Zika virus testing or pregnancy outcome (i.e., live births and pregnancy losses 
[spontaneous abortions, pregnancy terminations, and stillbirths combined]).
† October 2016 birth data are preliminary.

meters, in areas without active, vectorborne Zika virus trans-
mission (7). Second, microcephaly is a difficult birth defect to 
monitor because there are inconsistent definitions, obtaining 
accurate measurements is challenging, and terminology is 
inconsistent. Because of these challenges, prevalence estimates 
vary widely among countries and among surveillance systems 
within the United States (4). Third, the reports of microcephaly 
from Brazil might have served as an early warning. As evidence 
was emerging about the link between Zika virus infection and 
microcephaly, the Colombian Ministry of Health issued a rec-
ommendation in February 2016 advising women to consider 
delaying pregnancy for 6 months, which might have affected 
subsequent birth rates.§ The number of live births in Colombia 
during epidemiologic weeks 5–45 decreased by approximately 
18,000 from 2015 to 2016.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, the report includes all cases of microcephaly and 
not just those linked to Zika virus. The majority of cases of 
microcephaly lacked laboratory confirmation of Zika virus 
infection. Possible explanations are that specimens were not 
submitted for all cases, specimens that were submitted were 
not collected within the recommended time frames (maternal 
serum specimens within 5 days of date of symptom onset for 
rRT-PCR testing and infant serum or fetal tissue specimens 
within 2 days of delivery), and neuroimaging studies were not 
available for the majority of patients (68%). Second, ascertain-
ment of birth defects, including microcephaly, tends to be 
more complete among live born infants than among pregnancy 
losses, because of the condition of the fetus at the time of the 
loss as well as the relatively infrequent use of fetal autopsy to 
determine the cause of fetal death, leading to underestimation 
of the number of cases of microcephaly, especially among preg-
nancy losses (8). In addition, because microcephaly is a rare 
outcome, prevalence ratios comparing 2016 and 2015 might be 
unstable and should be interpreted with caution. Third, passive 
reporting systems tend to have less complete ascertainment of 
all birth defects compared with active surveillance systems (9). 
Finally, the ascertainment of birth defects generally does not 
capture infants or fetuses whose birth defects are not apparent 
prenatally or at delivery, but rather are identified several months 
after birth. Certain critical outcomes, such as deceleration of 
brain growth among infants who are born with normal head 
circumferences, are not captured by this surveillance (10).
Colombia’s national population-based surveillance system 
for birth defects is based on passive reporting, which pro-
vides critical data for monitoring the impact of teratogens 
and describing trends but likely underestimates the actual 
prevalence of birth defects, including those defects associated 
with Zika virus infection during pregnancy. Also, Colombia’s 
Zika virus surveillance is based on clinical symptoms, and 
asymptomatic Zika virus infections are not monitored by 
surveillance. Therefore, the overall percentage of women who 
are infected with Zika virus, or infected in early pregnancy 
or during the periconceptional period is unknown. To bet-
ter understand the effects of Zika virus, INS and CDC are 
collaborating on “Proyecto Vigilancia de Embarazadas con 
Zika” (Enhanced Surveillance Project of Pregnant Women 
with Zika) to conduct intensified active monitoring in three 
cities in Colombia with high incidence of Zika virus disease 
in pregnant women. This project, which includes systematic 
collection of laboratory specimens for Zika virus testing, will 
provide more accurate estimates of the risk for microcephaly

and other adverse birth outcomes among fetuses and infants 
of mothers with Zika virus disease during pregnancy.
In the absence of a vaccine to prevent Zika virus infection 
or a specific medication for treatment, prevention strate-
gies include avoiding travel to areas with active Zika virus 
transmission, preventing mosquito bites through personal 
protection and vector control, and avoiding sexual transmis-
sion. Ongoing population-based birth defects surveillance 
provides critical data for monitoring the impact of teratogens, 
including Zika virus infection, and will be an essential tool to 
evaluate success in preventing microcephaly and congenital 
Zika syndrome.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly 
and serious brain abnormalities in fetuses and infants exposed 
in utero. The Zika virus disease outbreak in the World Health 
Organization’s Region of the Americas began in Brazil, which 
first reported a laboratory-confirmed Zika virus outbreak in 
May 2015; Colombia confirmed local transmission of Zika virus 
about 5 months later, in October 2015. Colombia’s Instituto 
Nacional de Salud maintains national surveillance for birth 
defects, including microcephaly.
What is added by this report?
This report provides preliminary national birth defects surveil-
lance data on congenital microcephaly following a large 
outbreak of Zika virus infection in Colombia. Microcephaly 
prevalence increased more than fourfold overall in 2016 
compared with 2015, with a ninefold increase in July 2016 (the 
peak month) compared with July 2015. The temporal associa-
tion between Zika virus infections and microcephaly, with the 
peak of reported microcephaly occurring approximately 
24 weeks after the peak of the Zika outbreak, provides evidence 
that the greatest risk period is likely the first trimester of 
pregnancy and early in the second trimester of pregnancy.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Colombia has experienced a significant increase in congenital 
microcephaly in 2016 following the peak of the Zika virus 
disease outbreak. Ongoing population-based birth defects 
surveillance is essential for monitoring the impact of Zika virus 
infection during pregnancy on birth defects prevalence and 
measuring the success in preventing Zika virus infection and its 
consequences, including microcephaly.
