Abstract
Obese and sedentary persons have an increased risk for
cancer, but underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
Angiogenesis is common to adipose tissue formation and
remodeling, and to tumor vascularization. A total of 439
overweight/obese, healthy, postmenopausal women [body
mass index (BMI) > 25 kg/m2] ages 50–75 years, recruited
between 2005 and 2008 were randomized to a 4-arm 12-month
randomized controlled trial, comparing a caloric restriction
diet arm (goal: 10% weight loss, N ¼ 118), aerobic exercise
arm (225 minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous activity,
N ¼ 117), a combined diet þ exercise arm (N ¼ 117), or
control (N ¼ 87) on circulating levels of angiogenic biomar-
kers. VEGF, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and
pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) were measured by
immunoassay at baseline and 12 months. Changes were com-
pared using generalized estimating equations, adjusting for
baseline BMI, age, and race/ethnicity. Participants randomized
to the diet þ exercise arms had statistically significantly greater
reductions in PAI-1 at 12 months compared with controls
(�19.3% vs. þ3.48%, respectively, P < 0.0001). Participants
randomized to the diet and diet þ exercise arms had statistically
significantly greater reductions in PEDF (�9.20%, �9.90%,
respectively, both P < 0.0001) and VEGF (�8.25%, P ¼
0.0005; �9.98%, P < 0.0001, respectively) compared with con-
trols. There were no differences in any of the analytes in parti-
cipants randomized to the exercise arm compared with controls.
Increasing weight loss was statistically significantly associated
with linear trends of greater reductions in PAI-1, PEDF, and
VEGF. Weight loss is significantly associated with reduced cir-
culating VEGF, PEDF, and PAI-1, and could provide incentive for
reducing weight as a cancer prevention method in overweight
and obese individuals. Cancer Res; 76(14); 4226–35. �2016 AACR.
Introduction
Overweight and obesity is associated with increased risk of
a variety of cancers (1), and regular physical activity is
associated with reduced cancer risk (2). A largely unexplored
mechanism that could link obesity with cancer risk is angio-
genesis, a process where new blood vessels form from pre-
existing vessels allowing tissues to expand, regulated by
maintaining a balance between proangiogenic and antiangio-
genic factors (3). Angiogenesis plays an important role in
obesity; adipose tissue is highly plastic, and requires vascu-
larization to expand (4). Here, we investigated the pro-
angiogenic VEGF and plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1
(PAI-1), and the antiangiogenic pigment epithelium-derived
factor (PEDF), as they have been extensively studied in
overweight/obesity, and have also been implicated in tumor-
igenesis in both animal models and in epidemiologic studies,
extending our previous investigation of physical activity on
these biomarkers (5).
Angiogenesis blockade is an active area of clinical and trans-
lational research (6, 7). Most of the developed drugs target VEGF
and its related pathways, including bevacizumab, an mAb that
inhibits VEGF-A, which has been approved for use by the FDA for
treatment of a number of cancers (8). However, given the poten-
tial adverse effects of these compounds (9), they have not been
proposed for the cancer prevention setting. Low-risk and low-cost
methods for reducing angiogenesis, therefore, could have impor-
tant public health benefits.
VEGF is a key regulator of angiogenesis and vascular per-
meability (10). VEGF is elevated in the obese state (11, 12),
although mice overexpressing VEGF were protected against
diet-included obesity and insulin resistance (13). VEGF can
also promote the growth, survival, migration, and invasion of
cancer cells (14). PAI-1 is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin)
and is elevated in overweight and type II diabetic patients
(15, 16). It promotes angiogenesis (17, 18), and is a prognostic
marker for poor outcome in a number of cancers including
breast (19). PEDF, an adipokine and serpin, has antiangio-
genic properties and is active against a wide range of angio-
genic stimuli, including VEGF (20). It has broad antitumor
activity, and reduced levels of PEDF are associated with a worse
prognosis in a variety of different cancers (21). However, it is

 also associated with the presence of the metabolic syndrome,
and contributes to the development of insulin resistance in
obesity (22, 23).
Excessive accumulation of adipose tissue creates a protumori-
genic environment, characterized by inflammation, macro-
phage invasion, and increased angiogenesis (24). In this envi-
ronment, tumor cells can circumvent inhibitory signals and
harness these dysregulated processes to proliferate, and form
new blood vessels, resulting in inappropriate growth and tissue
invasion (24, 25). Further expansion of established dormant
avascular tumors requires initiation of angiogenesis, or the
"angiogenic switch," allowing the tumor to transition to expo-
nential growth (26).
Previously, we found that women who lost at least 1.85%
of baseline fat mass (corresponding to median levels) in a
12-month exercise intervention experienced significant reduc-
tions in some biomarkers of angiogenesis (5), compared with
sedentary controls. To extend this research, we investigated the
independent and combined effects of dietary weight loss and
exercise on circulating levels of VEGF, PAI-1, and PEDF, in the
context of a completed 12-month randomized controlled trial
(RCT), the Nutrition & Exercise for Women (NEW) trial. We
randomly
assigned
439
postmenopausal
overweight/obese
women to a reduced calorie dietary weight loss program, an
aerobic exercise program, a combined dietary weight loss plus
exercise program, or to a control arm. We hypothesized that
women randomized to dietary weight loss, with or without
exercise, would have significant decreases in VEGF and PAI-1,
and increases in PEDF, compared with controls.
Patients and Methods
This study is ancillary to the NEW (www.clinicaltrials.gov
NCT00470119) study, a 12-month RCT that tested the effects of
caloric restriction and/or exercise on circulating sex steroid hor-
mones in healthy overweight postmenopausal women. The study
was carried out in the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center
(FHCRC; Seattle, WA), and performed with the approval of the
FHCRC Institutional Review Board, in accordance with an assur-
ance filed with and approved by the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services. Written informed consent was obtained
from each participant.
Study population
The trial is described in detail elsewhere (27). Briefly, 439
postmenopausal, healthy overweight [body mass index (BMI)
> 25 kg/m2], sedentary women, ages 50–75 years, not taking
hormonal therapy, were recruited through media and mass mail-
ings and were enrolled in the study between 2005 and 2008;
12-month follow-up for all participants was completed in 2009.
Eligible participants were randomly assigned to a (i) reduced-
calorie dietary modification intervention (N ¼ 118); (ii) moder-
ate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic exercise intervention (N ¼ 117);
(iii) combined diet and exercise intervention (N ¼ 117); or (iv)
control (no intervention; N ¼ 87). Exclusion criteria included:
>100 minutes/week of moderate physical activity; diagnosed
serious medical condition(s); postmenopausal hormone use;
consumption of >2 alcoholic drinks/day; current smoking; par-
ticipation in another structured weight loss program; contraindi-
cation to participation (e.g., abnormal exercise tolerance test).
Permuted block randomization was used to achieve a propor-
tionally smaller control group, stratified according to BMI (� or
<30 kg/m2) and race/ethnicity. The random assignment was
generated by a computerized program, written by the study
statistician, and run by the study manager to assign eligible
participants to study arms. Investigators and laboratory staff were
blinded to randomization arm.
Interventions
The dietary intervention was a modification of the Diabetes
Prevention Program and LookAHEAD lifestyle behavior-change
programs with goals of 1,200 to 2,000 kcal/day, <30% daily
calories from fat, 10% weight loss by 6 months, and weight
maintenance thereafter. Participants had at least two individual
meetings with a dietician followed by weekly group meetings
for 6 months; thereafter, they attended monthly with biweekly
phone/email contact. Intervention adherence was defined by
percent of in-person nutrition session attendance.
The exercise intervention goal was 45 minutes of moderate-to-
vigorous [�4 metabolic equivalents (MET)] intensity exercise at a
target heart rate of 70%–85% observed maximum, 5 days/week
by week 7. Participants attended three facility-based supervised
sessions/week and exercised 2 days/week at home. They recorded
exercise mode, duration, peak heart rate, and perceived exertion at
each session. Activities of �4 METs (28) counted toward the
prescribed target.
Controls were asked not to change their diet or exercise habits.
Blood specimen collection and processing
Fasting (12 hours) venous blood samples were collected
during clinic visits at baseline (prerandomization) and 12
months, when the study was completed. Participants refrained
from alcohol (48 hours), vigorous exercise or NSAID use (24
hours) prior to fasting venous blood collection (50 mL) at
baseline and 12 months. Blood was processed within 1 hour,
and stored at �70�C.
Assays
VEGF, PEDF (serum), and PAI-1 (plasma) were assayed at the
Clinical and Epidemiologic Research Laboratory, at the Depart-
ment of Laboratory Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Bos-
ton, MA, using ELISA from R&D Systems. Duplicate pooled blood
samples were included for quality assurance (QA) purposes and
to assess interassay and intraassay coefficient of variation (CV).
Baseline and 12-month samples from each individual were
included in the same batch, and participants' samples were
randomly placed across batches. Laboratory personnel were
blinded with regard to subject and QA sample identity. Interassay
and intraassay CVs for each assay were: VEGF 7.3% and 5.9%;
PAI-1 8.2% and 7.9%; and PEDF 9.3% and 6.0%.
Covariates
All study measures were obtained at baseline and 12 months by
trained personnel blinded to participants' randomization status.
Height and weight were measured and BMI (kg/m2) calculated.
Body composition (fat mass and percent body fat) was measured
by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) whole-body scanner
(GE Lunar). Cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2 max) was assessed
using a maximal graded treadmill test according to a modified
branching protocol (29).
Questionnaires collected information on demographics,
medical history, dietary intake, supplement use, and physical

 activity patterns. Other covariates including adipokines, sex
steroid hormones, biomarkers of inflammation, lipids, blood
counts, and telomere length were measured as described pre-
viously (30–35).
Statistical analyses
Partial Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated
between baseline biomarker measures, with Bonferroni
correction for multiple testing (0.05/99 ¼ significant at
P < 0.0005).
Descriptive data are presented as geometric means [95%
confidence intervals (CI)]. Mean changes in analytes from
baseline to 12 months, stratified by arm, were computed. The
intervention effects on these variables were examined on the
basis of the assigned treatment at randomization, regardless
of adherence or study retention (i.e., intent-to-treat). Mean
12-month changes in the intervention arm were compared
with controls using the generalized estimating equations (GEE)
modification of linear regression to account for intraindividual
correlation over time. Intervention effects are presented as both
absolute and relative change. Bonferroni correction adjusted
for multiple comparisons (two-sided a ¼ 0.05/3 ¼ 0.02 for
three comparisons) for the primary analysis. We used the
method of last observation carried forward to deal with missing
data at 12 months.
Changes in body composition and VO2 max levels were
calculated and used to stratify observed changes in analytes
between arms at 12 months. Weight loss was categorized as no
change/gained any weight (referent); lost <5% of baseline
weight; and lost >5% of baseline weight. Participants with
missing 12-month data were categorized as no change/gained
weight. Changes in VO2 max were calculated and categorized as
tertiles (increased <3.5%; increased >3.5%–14.3%; increased
>14.3%); participants with missing VO2 max data at 12 months
were classified as increased <3.5%. Percent fat loss was catego-
rized as: no change/gaining any fat; decreasing <2.6%; decreas-
ing 2.6%–6.4%; and decreasing >6.4%, corresponding to tertiles
of change. Participants missing 12-month percent body fat, were
categorized as no change/gaining fat. Fat loss, weight change,
and VO2 max levels in the control group were added as separate
categories.
In secondary analyses, we examined changes in analytes for
each intervention arm in subgroups of participants compared
with controls by the above categories of weight loss, change in
VO2 max, and change in percent body fat.
All models were adjusted for age, baseline BMI (<30 kg/m2,
>30 kg/m2) and race/ethnicity. All statistical tests were two sided.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (version
8.2, SAS Institute Inc.).
Results
Participants
At 12 months, 399 of 439 participants completed physical
exams and provided a blood sample, 397 underwent a DXA scan,
and 371 completed a VO2 max test; 39 did not complete the study
(Fig. 1). One participant randomized to diet þ exercise was
excluded from analysis due to missing baseline blood measures.
At baseline, participants were on average 57.9 years, with an
average BMI of 30.9 kg/m2, and were predominantly non-His-
panic Whites (Table 1).
Intervention fidelity
Data on intervention adherence, weight loss, and body com-
position changes in this trial have been reported previously (27).
The mean weight change was �2.4% (P ¼ 0.03; exercise arm),
�8.5% (P < 0.001; diet), and �10.8% (P < 0.001; diet þ exercise)
vs. �0.8% among controls. Women in all intervention groups
significantly reduced percent body fat (all P < 0.001) compared
with controls.
Percent of daily calories from fat decreased in both the diet and
diet þ exercise arms (�6.7% and �8.0%, respectively). In both
diet groups, women attended an average of 27 diet counseling
sessions (86%). Women randomized to exercise participated in
moderate-to-vigorous activity for a mean (SD) of 163.3 (70.6)
minutes/week, whereas women randomized to diet þ exercise
participated for 171.5 (62.9) minutes/week. Both groups signif-
icantly increased average pedometer steps/day and VO2 max
compared with baseline.
Baseline correlations
After Bonferroni correction, both PAI-1 and PEDF correlated
strongly and statistically significantly (hereon "significantly"; all
P < 0.0005) with the majority of markers associated with over-
weight (anthropometrics), triglyceride levels, and insulin dysre-
gulation, and negatively with adiponectin, ghrelin, and HDL
cholesterol (Table 2). PEDF correlated positively and significantly
with C-reactive protein (CRP) and Serum amyloid protein A
(SAA). Both had significant and negative associations with sex
hormone binding globulin; with red blood cell counts and
hematocrit levels (PAI-1 only); and with white blood cell counts
(PEDF only); all P < 0.001. VEGF did not correlate significantly
with any baseline variables, with the exception of blood platelets
(P < 0.0001).
Intervention effects
Participants randomized to the diet þ exercise arms had sta-
tistically significantly greater reductions in PAI-1 at 12 months
compared with controls (�19.3% vs. þ3.48%, respectively, P <
0.0001; Table 3). Participants randomized to the diet (�9.20%)
and diet þ exercise (�9.90%) arms had significantly greater
reductions in PEDF compared with those randomized to the
control arm (þ0.18%), all P < 0.0001. Finally, participants
randomized to the diet (�8.25%, P ¼ 0.0005) and diet þ exercise
(�9.98%, <0.0001) arms had significantly greater reductions in
VEGF compared with those randomized to the control arm
(�1.21%). There were no statistically significant differences in
any of the analytes in participants randomized to the exercise arm,
compared with controls.
There was a statistically significant linear trend of reductions in
PAI-1, PEDF, and VEGF with increasing weight loss among
participants randomized to both the diet and diet þ exercise arm:
PAI-1, Ptrend ¼ 0.0003; Ptrend < 0.0001, respectively; PEDF both
Ptrend < 0.0001; and VEGF both Ptrend < 0.0001 (Table 4). In
addition, participants who were randomized to the exercise arm
had a statistically significant linear trend of reductions in PEDF
with increasing levels of weight loss (Ptrend ¼ 0.002), but not in
PAI-1 or VEGF.
Participants randomized to the diet þ exercise arm and who
increased their VO2 max levels by any level (Table 5) had
significantly greater decreases in PAI-1 compared with controls
(Ptrend ¼ 0.0006). Similar trends were seen for PEDF and VEGF
(both Ptrend < 0.0001). There were no statistically significant

Discussion
This study compared the effects of dietary weight loss,
exercise, or their combination on circulating levels of regula-
tors of angiogenesis, in a large sample of healthy, overweight/
obese postmenopausal women. While correlation does not
imply causality, the strong and statistically significant associa-
tions between PAI-1, PEDF, and the majority of the anthro-
pometric markers and circulating adipokines, suggest that they
are interlinked with other factors associated with overweight
and obesity. Of interest, despite PEDFs' categorization as an
antiangiogenic factor, all of the correlations were in the same
direction as for PAI-1, confirming similar results from a study
in 125 men (36). In contrast, VEGF levels did not correlate
significantly with any variable, with the exception of platelet
levels and white blood cell counts. Platelets are themselves
regulators of angiogenesis; they have a proliferative effect on
cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo (37) and can guide
formation of early metastatic niches (38).
Women randomized to the diet and diet þ exercise arms had
statistically significant reductions in PEDF (�9.20% and
�9.90%, respectively) and VEGF (�8.35% and �9.98%, respec-
tively); and statistically significant reductions in PAI-1 in wom-
en randomized to the diet þ exercise arm only (�19.3%).
Weight loss appeared to account for the majority of these
changes, with increasing quantities of weight loss and reduc-
tions in percent body fat both associated with statistically
significant linear decreases in all analytes. This effect was seen
only in women randomized to the diet and diet þ exercise arms
for PAI-1 and VEGF, but in all three intervention arms for PEDF.
However, changes in VO2 max in the exercise arm alone were

 not associated with statistically significant reductions in any
analyte. We confirmed that despite being an antiangiogenic
factor, weight loss is significantly associated with reductions in
PEDF.
While some studies have also reported effects of exercise and
weight loss on these angiogenic factors (39, 40), the studies have
been small (41, 42), cross-sectional (43), or limited to men (44).
In one study, 79 participants were randomized to a 12-week trial
comparing an exercise intervention, a hypocaloric diet, and a
combined arm, found that VEGF-A was nonsignificantly reduced
by 10% to 22% in the weight loss groups. However, the study
lacked a control arm (39). In our previous exercise trial in
overweight/obese postmenopausal women, a 12-month exercise
intervention produced a significantly greater reduction in PEDF
levels (�3.7%), compared with control condition (þ3.0%; P ¼
0.009), and that above median loss of body fat was associated
with greater reduction in PEDF (5). The reasons for this difference
are unclear—baseline levels of analytes in the current study were
similar to those in our earlier investigation (444.9 pg/mL, VEGF;
11.8 mg/mL, PEDF; and 6.1 ng/mL, PAI-1; ref. 5). Dietary weight
loss was not tested in that trial. A small study of 33 obese men and
women also reported that weight loss was statistically significantly
associated with reductions in circulating PEDF levels (36). A
variety of studies have characterized the antitumorigenic effects
of PEDF (21), so the reductions in PEDF in response to weight loss
appear to be counterintuitive. However, its actions appear to be
tissue-specific, having, for example, anti-inflammatory effects in
the retina, and proinflammatory effects in adipose tissue and
macrophages (21).
In our previous studies investigating the role of weight loss and
exercise on circulating biomarkers, the majority of the biomarkers
that were reduced (or in some cases elevated) in response to
weight loss were also reduced or elevated, albeit to a lesser degree,
by exercise alone (30–32, 34, 35). Our findings here indicate that
exercise alone, either by intervention arm, or when stratified by
changes in VO2 max, had no effect on PEDF, PAI-1, or VEGF. With
the exception of PEDF, weight loss in the exercise arm was not
associated with alterations in levels of these analytes. Exercise
increases both skeletal muscle mass and circulation; both pro-
cesses require upregulation of angiogenesis. It is unclear why the
exercise intervention or increases in VO2 max in the exercise arm
alone, did not affect circulating levels of VEGF, PAI-1, or PEDF.
However, while there are few data on this topic in the literature, it
appears that expression of angiogenic factors may be localized to
muscle tissue, and may contribute little to circulating levels. A
small RCT of 79 obese men and women randomized to a diet,
exercise, or control arm found no statistically significant differ-
ences in circulating VEGF levels in the exercise arm at 6 months
(39). Finally, the degree of weight loss experienced by participants
in our study in the exercise arm (�2.4%) compared with �8.5% in
the diet arm, and �10.8% in the diet þ exercise arm (27), may
have been insufficient to influence circulating levels of these
analytes. While it is impossible to ascertain whether reductions
in circulating levels of VEGF and other angiogenic factors could
impact tumor-level angiogenesis, systemic reductions in these
markers might conceivably be associated with a less favorable
milieu for tumor growth and proliferation. It has been hypoth-
esized that, as a consequence of metabolic syndrome, upregula-
tion of PAI-1 expression predisposes breast cancer to more aggres-
sive stages, partially by affecting angiogenesis (45, 46). Proangio-
genic factors such as VEGF secreted by adipose stem cells have
been implicated in tumor growth by promoting vascularization
(47, 48). Indeed, a review suggested that a chemopreventive
approach targeting both angiogenesis and inflammation in
healthy individuals (termed angioprevention) may prevent
tumor cell growth and progression by blocking vascularization
of indolent tumors (6). Suggested interventions include meta-
bolic regulators such as metformin, anti-inflammatory agents,
and a variety of phytochemicals and their derivatives (6). How-
ever, many antiangiogenic drugs, including metformin (49), have
significant side effects. Weight loss may represent a safe and
effective method of improving the angiogenic profile in both
patients with cancer and in healthy individuals.
Study strengths include the randomized trial design, the inclu-
sion of dietary weight loss, exercise, and combined weight loss
and exercise interventions, the excellent adherence to interven-
tions, and high quality and valid biomarker assays. Limitations
include the relatively homogenous population, which may limit
generalizability, assays of only a select number of angiogenesis
markers, and measurement of angiogenesis only in blood rather
than in target tissue. Linear analyses may potentially incorporate
observational study weaknesses, such as confounding. However,

 we used the GEE modification of linear regression analyses, which
has been demonstrated to overcome potential observational
study weaknesses such as confounding, effect modification, and
correlation within individuals over time.
In conclusion, we report that weight loss reduced circulating
VEGF, PEDF, and PAI-1, and suggest that weight loss in over-
weight or obese postmenopausal women may reduce risk for
cancer in part through altering angiogenesis. Further investiga-
tions into the unexpected reductions of PEDF levels with weight
loss are warranted.
