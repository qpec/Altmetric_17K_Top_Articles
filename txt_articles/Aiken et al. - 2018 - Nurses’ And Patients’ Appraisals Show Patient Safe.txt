 Nurses' and Patients' Appraisals Show Patient Safety in Hospitals Remains
a Concern
Abstract
In the report To Err is Human (1999), the National Academy of Medicine called for national action to
improve patient safety in hospitals. The report concluded that improving nurse work environments—assuring
adequate nurse staffing and supporting nurses’ ability to care for patients—was critical to these efforts. Two
decades later, have nurse work environments improved, and has that had a noticeable impact on patient
safety? To find out, a research team led by LDI Senior Fellow Linda Aiken, PhD, RN surveyed more than
800,000 patients and 53,000 nurses in 535 hospitals in 2005, and again in 2016.

In the report T

concluded that improving nurse work environments—assuring adequate nurse staffing and supporting nurses’ ability to care for patients—was critical

researchers surveyed more than 800,000 patients and 53,000 nurses in 535 hospitals in 2005, and again in 2016.
1. Hospital nurses and patients report ongoing concerns about safety and quality in 2015-2016
Conclusion
Failure to improve clinical work environments may impede progress on patient safety. Incentives are needed to reward hospitals for 
improvements linked to patient safety, such as providing greater autonomy to nurses to make timely decisions on behalf of patients, and 
promoting leadership that is committed to a culture of continuous quality and safety improvement.

Nurses
  
15-percentage point increase in 
nurses giving hospitals high patient 
safety grades
  
15-percentage point increase in nurses 
reporting excellent quality of care
Patients
  
8-percentage point increase in patients 
that would definitely recommend their 
hospital 
  
11-percentage point increase in patients 
giving hospitals a favorable rating
