Cognitive neuroscience has long sought to understand the biological foundations of human 
intelligence. Decades of research have revealed that general intelligence is correlated with two 
brain-based biomarkers: the concentration of the brain biochemical N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) 
measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and total brain volume measured 
using structural MR imaging (MRI). However, the relative contribution of these biomarkers in 
predicting performance on core facets of human intelligence remain to be well characterized. In 
the present study, we sought to elucidate the role of NAA and brain volume in predicting fluid 
intelligence (Gf). Three canonical tests of Gf (BOMAT, Number Series, and Letter Sets) and 
three working memory tasks (Reading, Rotation, and Symmetry span tasks) were administered 
to a large sample of healthy adults (n=211). We conducted exploratory factor analysis to 
investigate the factor structure underlying Gf independent from working memory and observed 
two Gf components (verbal/spatial and quantitative reasoning) and one working memory 
component. Our findings revealed a dissociation between two brain biomarkers of Gf 
(controlling for age and sex): NAA concentration correlated with verbal/spatial reasoning, 
whereas brain volume correlated with quantitative reasoning and working memory. A follow-up 
analysis revealed that this pattern of findings is observed for males and females when analyzed 
separately. Our results provide novel evidence that distinct brain biomarkers are associated with 
specific facets of human intelligence, demonstrating that NAA and brain volume are 
independent predictors of verbal/spatial and quantitative facets of Gf.

Introduction 
Research in the psychological and brain sciences has long sought to elucidate the nature and 
mechanisms of human intelligence. Early research by Charles Spearman (1904) provided the 
foundation for this endeavor, revealing that individuals’ performance across a broad range of 
cognitive tasks is positively correlated.  This observation led Spearman (1927) to propose that a 
general factor (g) accounts for performance across the spectrum of cognitive ability – spanning 
attention, perception, memory, language, and thought. Decades of research have further 
demonstrated that the best measures of g involve tests of fluid intelligence (Gf) – the capacity to 
solve novel problems through adaptive reasoning and goal-directed decision making (Carroll, 
1993; Cattell, 1971; Gray & Thompson, 2004; Horn & Cattell, 1966; Jensen, 1980). 
Performance on tests of Gf are known to predict many aspects of life, including educational and 
work achievement, and social well-being (Colom & Flores-Mendoza, 2006; Gottfredson and 
Saklofske, 2009; Jensen, 1998; Neisser et al, 1996).  
 
Parallel developments in cognitive neuroscience have advanced our understanding of 
the neurobiological foundations of Gf (Barbey, Colom, Paul, & Grafman, 2014; Barbey, Colom, 
& Grafman, 2013a; 2013b; Jung & Haier, 2007).  An emerging area of research investigates the 
metabolic and biochemical correlates of intelligence using magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
(MRS). Accumulating evidence indicates that a specific biochemical marker is associated with 
general intelligence: N-acetyl aspartic acid (NAA) (Jung & Haier, 2007; Ross & Sachdev, 2004). 
NAA is a metabolite of glucose that is produced in the neurons and represents an important 
biochemical marker of energy production and neuronal health (Barker, 2001; Moffett, Ross, 
Arun, Madhavarao, & Namboodiri, 2007). Several studies have reported correlations between 
the concentration of NAA in the brain and various domains of cognition and intelligence (Jung & 
Haier, 2007; Ross & Sachdev, 2004), and the emerging evidence frequently favors a positive 
relationship between NAA and cognition.   
Nevertheless, this literature exhibits some variability and inconsistency (Patel, Blyth, 
Griffiths, Kelly, & Talcott, 2014).  Positive correlations have been reported between Gf and NAA 
in occipital-parietal white matter (WM) (Jung et al., 1999; Jung et al., 2005), the 
isthmus/splenium region of the corpus callosum (Aydin et al., 2012), and deep cerebral WM 
(Charlton et al., 2007). In contrast, NAA in frontal WM has been found to negatively correlate 
with Gf (Jung et al., 2005), while NAA in parietal WM has been found to be uncorrelated with Gf 
(Ferguson et al., 2002). Another study reported a positive correlation between a principle 
component loading heavily on Gf and frontal WM NAA, but not with occipital-parietal gray matter 
(GM) NAA (Ross, Sachdev, Wen, Valenzuela & Brodaty, 2005). A multi-voxel study using 
several tests of Gf found that NAA in right posterior GM correlated with some—but not all—tests 
of Gf, whereas no relationship with Gf and WM NAA in any region was found (Jung et al., 2009). 
Another recent multi-voxel study found that NAA in left frontal and parietal regions is related to 
Gf (Nikolaidis et al., 2016).   
One possible reason for disagreement across studies is that the strength of NAA-
intelligence correlations may depend upon the particular domain of intelligence measured. This 
would likely cause the NAA-intelligence correlation to be contingent upon the particular test(s) 
employed in a given study. Experiments relating Gf and NAA have generally used performance 
factors from the WAIS, or the Raven’s progressive matrices (RPM). The RPM test is considered 
to be one of the most fundamental and accurate tests of fluid reasoning ability (Jensen, 1998) 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
and draws upon spatial reasoning ability (Ackerman, Beier, & Boyle, 2002). Reasoning ability 
can also be manifest through quantitative or numerical reasoning (Ackerman et al., 2002), 
however, little is known whether these abilities relate to NAA concentration. 
By characterizing sub-domains of fluid intelligence, researchers have revealed sex 
differences in quantitative and verbal reasoning abilities (Halpern, 2013), and have 
demonstrated significant sex differences in the neurocorrelates of intelligence (Burgaleta et al., 
2012; Schmithorst, 2009; Witelson, Beresh, & Kigar, 2006). It is therefore reasonable to expect 
that examination of sex differences may be important for understanding the Gf-NAA relationship 
(Pfleiderer et al., 2004). However, studies reporting sex differences also exhibit inconsistent 
findings. Two studies have found positive Gf-NAA correlations for females but not males 
(Pfleiderer et al., 2004; Jung et al., 2005), but a study with a larger sample size reported similar 
Gf-NAA correlations for males and females (Jung et al., 2009).  
Disagreement across studies may also be due in part  to interrelated cognitive factors, or 
cognitive sub-components that drive performance on tests of intelligence. For example, there is 
a long history of behavioral evidence suggesting that Gf is closely related to working memory 
capacity (Kane, Hambrick, & Conway, 2005; Kyllonen & Christal, 1990; Martinez et al., 2011). 
More recent neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience evidence demonstrates a high degree of 
correspondence between the brain structures supporting working memory and Gf (Barbey et al., 
2014; Gray, Chabris & Braver, 2003; Kane & Engle, 2002), bolstering the behavioral evidence 
and further indicating these two constructs are linked. Therefore, evaluating the relationships 
between multiple cognitive domains to NAA within a sample may be a key factor for 
understanding MRS-intelligence relationships, and whether or not NAA is a specific marker for 
intelligence, or an array of cognitive abilities. 
Results across studies may also prove to be more consistent by reducing variability in  
methodology. First, improved quantification can be achieved by applying corrections for tissue 
fractions (Gussew, Erdtel, Hiepe, Rzanny, & Reichenbach, 2012); however, this is not 
performed in all studies (Patel, et al., 2014). Second, targeting regions of the brain that can be 
reliably positioned and scanned using MRS is critical, as it is possible to obtain intra-subject 
coefficients of variation as low as 5% for the most easily measured metabolites (Brooks, 
Friedman, & Stidley, 1999; Terpstra et al., 2015). However, selecting brain regions that are 
related to the cognitive domains of interest must be balanced with this requirement. The 
precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) are excellent locations for high quality spectra, 
and have been used extensitively in previous MRS studies. The PCC is involved in a wide range 
of cognitive functions, from internal awareness, to attention regulation. This region has strong 
reciprocal connections to the ACC and DLPFC, which are critical for executive function and fluid 
reasoning. It also has an exceptionally high basal metabolic rate, and given that PCC 
connectivity and activity specifically declines with age (Andrews-Hanna et al 2007; Leech 2014) 
and several disease states such as Alzheimer’s disease (Minoshima et al 1997), traumatic brain 
injury (Nakashima et al 2007), and schizophrenia (Haznedar et al 2004),  NAA in the PCC may 
be a good marker for overall brain metabolic health that is readily measurable via MRS. 
Another obstacle to obtaining reproducible results across studies is small sample sizes 
(Patel et al., 2014). Typical samples range between 30-80 subjects, with the largest including 88 
subjects (Ferguson et al., 2002). Results obtained with these small sample sizes are difficult to 
interpret—especially after dividing the sample into smaller subsets based on individual subject 
characteristics, such as sex (Jung et al., 2009). More generally, correlation coefficients tend to 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
lack stability in samples smaller than about 100 subjects when effect sizes are small or 
moderately sized (Schönbrodt & Perugini, 2013). Given that the relationships between Gf and 
NAA are small-moderate in effect, establishing solid relationships between Gf and NAA requires 
the use of much larger sample sizes. 
The use of larger sample sizes together with collection of a wide range of both MRI and 
behavioral data should also allow researchers to control for other factors related to intelligence, 
thereby elucidating the unique contribution of NAA to Gf, and disentangling the Gf-NAA 
empirical landscape from possible confounding variables. One of the most well-established 
neurocorrelates of intelligence is total brain volume (Ivanovic et al., 2004; Ritchie et al., 2015; 
for reviews, see Luders, Narr, Thompson, & Toga, 2009; McDaniel, 2005; Rushton & Ankney, 
2009). This relationship is likely due to an increased number of neurons (Rushton & Ankney, 
2009) or more efficient neuronal metabolism in larger brains (Gignac, Vernon & Wickett, 2003; 
Haier et al., 1995). Because NAA is a measure of neuronal density, viability, or efficiency, it is 
reasonable to expect that NAA-intelligence correlations may not be independent of brain size. A 
positive correlation between NAA and total WM volume has also been previously reported (Jung 
et al., 2005); however, two other studies showed that the NAA-intelligence relationship persist 
when brain size is covaried (Aydin et al., 2012; Nikolaidis et al., 2016). Further investigation is 
needed to understand whether NAA and brain volume independently account for variance in 
intelligence scores, or if their predictive power overlaps.  
The present study seeks to characterize the roles of NAA concentration and brain volume in 
predicting Gf, and whether or not these two markers are independent predictors of Gf. Our study 
investigated a sample size of over 200 participants, more than doubling the largest sample size 
reported in the literature to date. Additionally, we measured both Gf and working memory using 
three unique, well-established tests in order to investigate how NAA and brain volume relate to 
underlying sub-factors of fluid reasoning, and whether those relationships depend upon working 
memory. Our estimates of brain volume include total brain volume as well as tissue specific, 
total gray and total white matter volumes. Our measurements of NAA are obtained from a single 
voxel in medial parietal cortex extending inferiorly into the posterior cingulate cortex—an 
excellent region for obtaining high quality spectra that has been widely used and validated in 
prior research. Furthermore, our analysis of the relationship between Gf and NAA takes into 
account age and sex for the assessment of Gf, as well as tissue composition in estimating NAA 
concentration.

2.1 
Participants 
Participants were recruited from the Urbana-Champaign community as part of a larger cognitive 
training intervention study designed to assess the efficacy of different intervention modalities on 
cognitive performance in healthy adults. All data reported here were collected as part of the 
baseline, pre-intervention assessment, which included a battery of cognitive tests and an MRI 
session. The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Institutional Review Board approved all 
aspects of the study and participants provided informed consent at enrollment. A total of 225 
participants from that sample underwent an MRI scanning session including MRS during 
baseline (i.e., pre-intervention) testing; of those, 211 participants had complete MRS (7 
excluded due to MRI/MRS quality), behavioral (one excluded due to missing), and demographic

(six excluded due to missing) data. All participants: were right-handed with normal or corrected-
to-normal vision without color blindness; reported no previous neurological injuries, disorders, or 
surgeries; were on no medications affecting central nervous function; were not pregnant; had no 
head injury or loss of consciousness in the past 2 years; and were proficient in English. 
Participants received monetary compensation for their participation. Basic demographics were 
collected via self-report and are summarized in Table 1. There was no significant difference 
between males and females in age [t(209)=0.57, p=0.57]. Although a higher proportion of 
females were college graduates than males (Table 1). Approximately 75% of males and females 
reported having some college or graduated college; therefore, males and females were roughly 
equally educated.

Cognitive testing procedures 
All cognitive tests were computer administered in a quiet room. Test administrators provided 
general instruction and oversight during the approximately three hour testing session and test-
specific instructions were provided through on-screen prompts. Participants wore headphones 
during the session and made responses with the mouse or keyboard. 
The pre-intervention cognitive battery included a total of 12 tests: three unique tests for 
each cognitive construct including Gf, working memory, executive function, and episodic 
memory. Gf and working memory are included in all analyses herein (although performance on 
executive function and episodic memory is not within the scope of the present manuscript, 
interested readers may find analyses including these tasks in supplementary materials).  
2.2.1 Fluid Intelligence 
 
Because fluid reasoning can manifest in a broad array of abilities including spatial, 
quantitative, and verbal (Ackerman et al., 2002), our tests were selected to tap into each. The 
three Gf tests included the BOMAT, Number Series, and Letter Sets.  
BOMAT. In the this task (Hossiep, Turck, & Hasella, 1999; Jaeggi, Buschkuehl, Jonides, Perrig, 
2008; Moody, 2009), which is similar to RPM but has greater difficulty levels to avoid ceiling 
effects, participants were presented a series of 5x3 matrices that each depict a pattern (29 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
different matrices in total with 45 minutes to complete the test), with each matrix missing one 
cell. The participant’s task was to select one of six possible answers that complete the matrix 
pattern.  
Number Series. In the Number Series task (Harrison, Shipstead, Hicks, Hambrick, Redick, & 
Engle, 2013; Thurstone, 1938), participants were shown a series of arithmetic number patterns 
that follow an arithmetic sequence, and their task was to select the next number in the series 
from five possible answer options (10 trials in total with 5 minutes granted to complete the test).  
Letter Sets. In the Letter Sets task (Ekstrom et al., 1976; Harrison et al., 2013), participants 
were shown five sets of letters with four letters in each set. Four of the five letter sets followed a 
common rule, and participant’s task was to select the letter set that is different from the other 
four (15 trials in total with 7 minutes to complete the test).  
2.2.2 Working Memory 
 
The working memory tests included: reading span; rotation span; and symmetry span. For all 
three tasks, shortened versions were administered, which have been verified to retain the 
psychometric properties of the longer versions (Foster et al., 2015; Oswald, McAbee, Redick, & 
Hambrick, 2015).  
Reading Span. During the first practice phase, participants were shown a series of simple four 
letter words (nouns/verbs) each for 1s, after which they were asked to recall which ones they 
saw in the correct order from a selection of fifteen words. In the next practice phase, participants 
were shown a series of short sentences and were tasked to select whether or not they are 
understandable or nonsensical (e.g., ―We were two lawns out at sea before we lost sight of 
land.‖) The nonsensical sentences portion always came from changing one word (e.g., lawns for 
miles) at the beginning, middle, or end of the sentence. Roughly half of the presented sentences 
were nonsensical. Finally, during test trials, particpants would characterize the sentences and 
were immediately shown a four-letter word for 1s. After going through the entire set (set size 
range from 2-10), participant were given a recall cue and needed to identify the words they saw 
in correct order. Participants were told to maintain accuracy of characterizing the sentences 
correctly at 85% or higher. The time limit for evaluating sentences was individualized and 
determined by practice phase performance. There were 8 test trials in total. 
Rotation Span. Participants were asked to recall a sequence of short and long arrows radiating 
from the center of the screen against a background letter-rotation task. The letter-rotation task 
presented a normal or mirror- reversed G, F, or R, rotated at 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 
270°, or 315°. The task was to mentally rotate the letter, and then to indicate whether the letter 
was normal (True—approximately 50% of trials) or mirror reversed (False—also approximately 
50% of trials). Immediately after a response, the participant pressed a key clearing the screen 
for 0.5s and was presented a short or long arrow rotated at 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, 
or 315°. After 1s, the arrow disappeared and another letter or the recall cue appeared 
instructing the participant to recall all of the arrows from the preceding displays in the order they 
appeared. Participants are told to maintain accuracy on the letter-rotation task at 85% or higher. 
The time limit for the rotated letter judgment was individualized and determined by practice 
phase performance. Set sizes ranged from two to nine letter/arrow displays per trial (8 trials 
total).  
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
Symmetry Span. On each trial a 4x4 grid was presented in which one of the 16 possible 
locations was filled in red (650ms each for 3-6 locations). Participants were asked to remember 
the location of the red squares. Between each location presentation, participants were shown an 
8x8 grid of black and white rectangles. They wereasked to determine whether or not the grid 
was symmetric about the vertical axis (i.e., left half matches right). After all spatial locations 
were presented, participants were asked to reproduce the spatial locations in the order in which 
they were presented. Participants are told to maintain accuracy of identifying symmetry at 85% 
or higher and wereshown their accuracy at the end of each trial. The time limit for the symmetry 
judgment was individualized and determined by practice phase performance. There were a total 
of 8 trials.  
 
2.3 
MRI data acquisition and processing  
2.3.1 Acquisition 
All subjects were scanned on a Siemens 3T Magnetom Trio. Anatomical information was 
obtained using a high resolution 3D structural MPRAGE scan (0.9 mm isotropic, TR: 1900 ms, 
TI: 900 ms, TE=2.32 ms, with GRAPPA and an acceleration factor of 2).   
The anatomical scan was used to position a single voxel spectroscopy (SVS) scan in the 
parietal cortex extending into posterior cingulate cortex (voxel size: (20 mm)3, TR: 3000 ms, TE: 
30 ms, 40 averages, BW: 2000 Hz, vector size: 1024).  The voxel straddled the midline, 
including equal portions of the right and left hemispheres as shown in Figure 1.  Weak water 
suppression was employed and six regional saturation bands were placed around the voxel to 
reduce contamination from subcutaneous fat. An additional scan was performed without water 
suppression to aid with quantification. Immediately following the spectroscopy acquisition, a T2-
weighted overlay scan was performed with the same center location and orientation as the 
spectroscopy scan (TR=5000 ms, TE=84 ms, slice thickness 2 mm with 0.5 mm of spacing, 
FOV: 240 x 240 mm, 128 x 128 matrix size, GRAPPA acceleration factor: 2, 35 slices).

Right: example MRS spectrum output from LCModel (thin black line is original data; thick 
overlaid line is LCModel data).  
2.3.2 MRI data processing 
Metabolite quantitation was performed using tissue water as a reference (Gasparovic et al., 
2006). This approach is commonly used in studies that relate metabolite concentration to 
intelligence (Charlton et al., 2007; Jung et al., 1999; Jung et al., 2009; Jung et al., 2005; 
Kochunov et al., 2010; Ross et al., 2005).  Metabolite ratios have also been used in similar 
studies, however use of water scaling facilitates the interpretation of results and the separation 
of contributions from the different metabolites.   
Water-scaled spectra were analyzed using LCModel software (Version 6.3-1H; 
Provencher, 1993). No correction was performed to account for relaxation of metabolite signal.  
Because NAA and NAAG are difficult to differentiate (Edden, Pomper & Barker, 2007), here we 
analyze the combined concentration of NAA + NAAG, labeled herein as NAAt with a peak 
appearing at 2.02 ppm.  
Accurate water scaling requires corrections for the tissue composition of the voxel. Using 
the high resolution structural scan, we calculated the volume fractions of gray matter (GM), 
white matter (WM), and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) within each voxel using Matlab scripts 
(MathWorks, Natick, MA) that called functions from SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Centre for 
Neuroimaging). First, we segmented the MPRAGE using SPM8 to obtain tissue probability 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
maps of GM, WM and CSF. We then created a mask in the space of the T2 overlay 
corresponding to the location of the spectroscopy scan.  This mask has the same center and 
orientation as the T2-overlay but higher resolution (0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 mm).  We then registered the 
MPRAGE to the T2 overlay. The rotations and translations required for the registration were then 
applied to the tissue probability masks.  We resliced the tissue probability maps into space of 
the mask, and used the mask to calculate the volume fractions of GM, WM, and CSF within the 
volume of the spectroscopy voxel (see the white box shown in Figure 1). These tissue fractions 
were later used to stastically correct NAAt to correct for tissue volume-fraction dependencies 
(see section 2.4.2). 
Total brain volume was estimated from the MPRAGE image using the FSL FAST 
segmentation tool (Jenkinson, Beckmann, Behrens, Woolrich, & Smith, 2012; Zhang, Brady, & 
Smith, 2001). This approach yields probabilistic segmented images with values ranging from 0 
to 1 in every voxel for GM, WM, and CSF. Final tissue assignment in each voxel was 
accomplished by selecting the maximum probability value of the three tissue types, 
guaranteeing that only one tissue is assigned to each voxel uniquely. Total GM and WM volume 
was calculated separately by summing the volume across voxels assigned each tissue type, 
respectively. Total brain volume was taken as the sum of the GM and WM volumes. 
2.4 
Statistical Analysis of behavioral and MRS data 
All statistical analyses were carried out using R version 3.1.1 (www.r-project.org).  
2.4.1 Fluid intelligence composite and factor score construction 
Behavioral performance on the Gf tests and working memory tests was analyzed in two ways. 
First, each of the tests of Gf and working memory were standardized before being summed to 
create a composite Gf and composite working memory score (Baniqued et al., 2014). Second, 
all six Gf and working memory tests were submitted together to an exploratory factor analysis to 
characterize sub-domains of Gf and working memory (via PCA; Abdi & Williams, 2010; Jolliffe, 
2002). Use of an exploratory factor analysis allows us to investigate the interrelatedness of the 
tests, the cognitive factors, and to probe sub-domains of Gf in greater detail. Factor scores for 
each retained component were calculated after applying a rotation (both oblique and orthogonal 
rotations were tested—see section 3.1). We compared results from the factor analysis to those 
of the standardized composite Gf score.  
2.4.2 MRS metabolite correction 
Subjects with spectroscopy data were excluded if the full width at half maximum (FWHM) 
reported by LCModel was greater than 10 Hz (an effective cutoff for identifying subjects with 
poor spectral quality; five subjects excluded) or the segmentations in SPM8 failed (two subjects 
excluded).  
Calculated metabolite concentrations depend on the volume fractions of brain tissues 
within the single voxel spectroscopy scan (e.g., NAAt is known to be greater in GM than in WM 
(Gasparovic et al., 2006; Pfefferbaum, Adalsteinsson, Spielman, Sullivan, & Lim, 1999). We 
observed highly significant (two-tailed) correlations between NAAt and GM [r(209)=0.66, p < 
0.001] and CSF [r(209)=-0.79, p < 0.001] volume fractions within the SVS volume. Because of 
this observed systematic dependence, we corrected the water-scaled concentration values for

that model to use as our metabolite corrected for tissue fractions. This procedure de-correlates 
the metabolite with respect to the tissue fractions (all p-values > 0.99), and controls for the 
possibility that relationships observed between NAAt and cognitive variables are simply a 
byproduct of differences in tissue volume fractions. Concentrations of NAAt measured with this 
technique are referred to as NAAt-corrected. 
2.4.3 Models of interest 
The relationship between cognitive factors and metabolites was first assessed using Pearson’s 
correlation, and then tested further via multiple linear regression including other covariates. 
Performance on Gf tests tasks may vary with age (Horn & Cattell, 1967) and sex (Irwing & Lynn, 
2005); thus, including these as covariates in a more detailed analysis  provides more 
information about the nature of the NAA-intelligence relationship. The regression model 
predicted cognitive factor scores (dependent variable) from the metabolite concentration, 
estimated brain volume (independent variables) and age and sex (covariates). Finally, we re-
computed all statistical tests for males and females separately to determine if the magnitude of 
correlations differ across sexes.

PCA of Gf and working memory tests 
To perform dimensionality reduction with PCA, one common approach is to retain enough 
components to explain a fixed amount of the total variance, typically in the range of 70% to 95% 
(Jolliffe, 2002). We conservatively set our a priori inclusion criterion at 70% of the variance 
explained (i.e., our factor solution should explain a minimum of 70% of the variance in the data).  
Initially we performed an oblique rotation, because this solution does not impose orthogonality 
on the recovered components and previous work suggests that Gf and working memory are 
correlated. To meet our criterion, three components were retained accounting for 75% of the 
variance in the data. The largest correlation between factors was 0.344 (between components 
one and two), which is just above the 0.32 cut off recommended for determining whether factors 
are orthogonal (Tabanich and Fidell, 2007). This suggests that the components are not 
sufficiently orthogonal to justify using an orthogonal (varimax) rotation. However, we also 
applied a varimax rotation (Supplementary Table 1) to further corroborate the factor structure 
and to help confirm our interpretation of the Gf and working memory factors.  
Descriptive statistics for each test appear in Table 2, and Table 3 shows the rotated 
pattern matrix for the three retained components. Note that this pattern matrix was qualitatively 
identical using either an oblique or orthogonal rotation scheme (see Supplementary Table 1 for 
the orthogonal rotation pattern matrix). We observed a clear separation between the working 
memory and Gf tests. All three working memory tests largely load onto only the first component 
whereas the Gf tests split between the second and third components. Number Series and Letter 
Sets clearly load onto different Gf factors (see Table 3); BOMAT loads somewhat on both Gf 
factors, though most strongly contributes to the second component. For clarity and ease of 
understanding—together with the observed numerical loadings—we refer to the first factor as 
working memory, the second as verbal/spatial reasoning and the third as quantitative reasoning. 
Our factor structure implies that the two Gf factors we observe are both separable from working

memory; such a separation between Gf and working memory has been previously observed in a 
factor analysis that used tests similar to those used here (Foster et al., 2015). 
Both Gf factor scores are positively correlated with the composite Gf score: 
verbal/spatial factor, r(209)=0.823, p<0.001 or 67.8% shared variance; quantitative factor, 
r(209)=0.693, p<0.001, or 48.0% shared variance. The working memory factor score is very 
highly correlated with the working memory composite score: r(209)=0.998, p<0.001.

Bivariate correlations between Gf and brain biomarkers 
We observed that NAAt-corrected is positively correlated with verbal/spatial reasoning (Figure 
2), but not correlated with quantitative reasoning (see Table 4)1. In contrast, brain volume is 
strongly correlated with quantitative, but not verbal/spatial reasoning. These results therefore 
reveal a striking dissociation: brain volume is a marker of the quantitative reasoning factor, and 
NAAt-corrected is a marker of the verbal/spatial reasoning factor. The working memory factor

largely reflects the results of the quantitative reasoning factor: it is positively correlated with total 
brain volume, GM volume, and WM volume, but not NAAt-corrected. 
 
Furthermore, the correlations between the Gf factors and biomarkers are substantially 
stronger than the correlations between the composite Gf score and biomarkers (see Table 4). 
This underscores the power of the factor analytic approach employed here: the observed 
specificity of these empirically derived factors of fluid intelligence for very different brain 
biomarkers is lost when using a simple composite score. Finally, the observed relationship 
between brain volume and the quantitative factor score is not overwhelmingly driven by a single 
tissue type as both GM and WM volumes are significantly correlated with the quantitative factor 
score. Neither GM volume nor WM volume were significantly correlated with the verbal/spatial 
factor score.

Confirmatory modeling: Cognitive factors and brain biomarker models controlling 
for covariates. 
To assess the robustness of the each Gf-biomarker relationship, we fit a regression model that 
simultaneously included both biomarkers, NAAt-corrected and brain volume, while also 
including age and sex as covariates. To ensure our measured biomarkers are not systematically 
related to each other and are independently predicting variance in the full multiple regression 
model, we first computed the correlations between NAAt-corrected and brain volume. No linear 
relationship between the biomarkers was observed (p=0.96, two-tailed). Similarly no relationship 
was observed between NAAt-corrected and total white matter volume (p=.41, two-tailed) or total 
gray matter volume (p= 0.64, two-tailed); because GM and WM volume correlations were similar 
to total brain volume (see Table 4), and total brain volume was highly correlated with both GM 
and WM (both r > 0.97), only total brain volume was included in the regression analyses.  
This model was fit separately for each of the cognitive factor scores as well as the 
cognitive composite scores; the standardized regression parameter estimates and p-values for 
each biomarker appear in Table 5. After controlling for covariates, the composite Gf z-score is 
significantly correlated with NAAt-corrected, and has a trending positive correlation with brain 
volume. However, the dissociation between NAAt-corrected and brain volume with the 
verbal/spatial component and the quantitative component persists, suggesting that both NAAt 
and brain volume independently correlate with different facets of Gf even after controlling for 
performance differences driven by age, sex, and education. Brain volume remained the only 
biomarker significantly related to the working memory composite and factor scores.

For conciseness, the covariates’ parameter estimates are not presented in Table 5. 
However, the following covariates were trending or significant predictors in the models: age had 
a trending negative relationship with working memory (p=0.076), and a significant negative 
relationship with quantitative reasoning (p=0.03); similarly sex had a trending relationship with 
quantitative reasoning (p=0.084).

Sex differences in NAA and Gf 
3.4.1 Descriptive statistics and PCA of Gf tests 
Descriptive statistics for both males and females on each Gf test are presented in Table 2.  
Males and females performed equivalently on BOMAT and Letter Sets; however, males 
performed significantly better than females on Number Series in the present sample, 
t(209)=3.28, p=0.001. Descriptive statistics for the working memory tests also appear in Table 2. 
There were no significant sex differences in any of the working memory tests.  
Our data reveal some sex differences in the biomarkers. Males have higher brain 
volume, t(209)=8.92, p < 0.001 two-tailed, whereas females exhibit higher levels of NAAt 
(uncorrected for tissue fractions), t(209)=-3.6, p < 0.001 two-tailed. However, no sex differences 
are apparent in NAAt after performing the statistical correction for tissue volume fractions 
(p=0.15 two-tailed); thus, this difference is spurious and likely driven by male/female differences 
in tissue volume fractions within the MRS imaging volume.  
 
We conducted exploratory PCA to further examine the factor structure of Gf in males 
versus females: as before, an oblique rotation was used and three factors were retained for both 
groups explaining a total of 75% and 73% of the variance, respectively (Table 6). Notably, the 
general loadings and factor structure for males qualitiatively replicates that observed for the 
entire sample (i.e., including both males and females); however, the loadings for females are 
slightly different. Although Number Series and Letter Sets still load most heavily on separate 
components, BOMAT shares its heaviest loading with Number Series for females. Therefore, for 
females only, we refer to the first reasoning factor as ―quantitative/spatial‖ and the second factor 
as ―verbal.‖ As in the full sample, the working memory tests loaded most heavily on a distinct 
and separate component for both males and females.

3.4.2 Bivariate correlations between Gf and brain biomarkers 
We investigated whether the correlations between brain biomarkers and each Gf factor score 
are retained within each sex. Table 7 reports the correlations for each Gf component separately 
for males and females. As before, the composite Gf score shows weaker correlations across 
both biomarkers. Males demonstrate significant correlations between NAAt-corrected and 
verbal/spatial as well as between brain volume and quantitative reasoning, echoing the double 
dissociation reported for the full sample. Although females demonstrate non-significant 
correlations of lesser magnitude, the pattern is still consistent with the full sample’s pattern of 
results.  
The slightly larger sample of males yields more power to detect effects, however, the observed 
magnitude of correlations were not statistically different between males and females. Both the 
correlation between NAAt-corrected and the principally verbal component as well as the 
correlation between brain volume and the principally quantitative component were not 
significantly different between males and females (z=0.13, p=0.897; z=0.31, p=0.757, 
respectively). Similarly, the correlation between brain volume and the working memory 
component was not significantly different between males and females (z=-0.54, p=0.59).

Discussion 
To our knowledge, the present data set is the largest sample relating Gf to both NAA and brain 
volume. Here, we showed that NAA (measured in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and 
parietal cortex) and brain volume are dissociable predictors of two distinct components derived 
from our Gf tests: NAA predicts our verbal/spatial reasoning component, whereas brain volume 
predicts our quantitative reasoning component. Importantly, the biomarkers are more strongly 
correlated with those factor components than with a composite Gf score, indicating that our use 
of an empirical factor analytic approach offers a more nuanced, rich view of this particular data 
set, suggesting that the biomarkers exhibit specificity for separate, measurable sub-domains of 
fluid intelligence independent of working memory. Our data further show that this pattern of 
results replicates for males and females.

4.1 Brain biomarkers of fluid intelligence and working memory 
The positive correlation between Gf and NAA observed here is in line with many 
previous MRS-cognition studies (Ross & Sachdev, 2004) and is congruent with the hypothesis 
that NAA is a marker for general neuronal health or density (Moffett et al., 2007), but 
independent of brain volume, and perhaps reflective of capacity for cognitive performance. The 
magnitude of the Gf-NAA correlation value reported here is lower than those typically reported 
(see Patel et al., 2014). This is consistent with the fact that large studies tend to report smaller 
effect sizes (Patel et al., 2014), likely because the positive NAA-cognition relationships are 
somewhat over-estimated in smaller samples.  
Similarly, the observed positive correlations between brain volume and intelligence in the 
present study are consistent with a large literature demonstrating similar results (McDaniel, 
2005). The underlying factors driving the well-established brain volume-intelligence relationship 
are largely unknown. One possibility is that the correlation is driven by gene-environment 
interactions, suggesting  more complex, bi-directional causality in the relationship between 
intelligence and brain volume (Rushton & Ankney, 2009). Another possibility is that a larger 
brain size is advantageous for intelligence because of fundamental architectural, histological, 
and/or biochemical properties of the brain. One study has reported a positive relationship 
between white matter volume and NAA (Jung et al., 2005), suggesting that brain biochemistry, 
metabolism and volume may be interrelated. However, two studies have reported positive NAA-
intelligence relationships while controlling for brain size, suggesting that NAA and brain volume 
are independent predictors of intelligence (Aydin, et al. 2012, Nikolaidis, et al., 2016).  
Brain volume, but not NAA, is also significantly correlated with the working memory 
factor in our analysis. While previous research has shown positive correlations between working 
memory and brain volume (Wickett, Vernon, & Lee, 2000), MRS-cognition studies with memory 
are relatively small in number and, as with intelligence, report disparate results. One study 
reported a positive correlation between NAA (as a ratio to choline) and tests of memory in the 
medial temporal lobes (Giménez et al., 2004) and another study reported that NAA in frontal 
WM is positively correlated with working memory (Yeo, Hill, Campbell, Vigil & Brooks, 2000). In 
contrast, one multiple single-voxel MRS study reported no significant correlations with working 
memory in either occipital-parietal WM or frontal WM (Jung et al., 2005), and a recent mutli-
voxel study reported no significant correlation with working memory (Nikolaidis et al., 2016). Our 
data suggest that NAA is a specific marker for Gf, whereas NAA/Cr is related to working 
memory  (Supplementary Table 2). Our data also suggest that working memory is only weakly 
related to Gf. Although much psychometric evidence suggests a strong relationship between Gf 
and working memory, there is an active debate regarding the nature and strength of this 
relationship (Ackerman, Beier, & Boyle, 2005; Chuderski, 2013; Colom, et al., 2015; Conway, 
Kane, & Engle, 2003; Kane, Hambrick, & Conway, 2005)—for example, one study (Chuderski, 
2013) has argued that Gf and working memory are only strongly related when time pressure is 
applied in Gf tests. Appealing to relationships with brain biomarkers may help to further 
disentangle under what psychometric conditions working memory and Gf are related. Minimally, 
our results hint that the relationship between verbal/spatial reasoning and NAA is not dependent 
on working memory, but the relationship between quantitative reasoning and brain volume could 
partly depend on working memory.   
Our results clearly demonstrate that NAA and brain volume (including segmented GM 
and WM volumes) are independent, dissociable predictors of separable sub-components of fluid

intelligence, suggesting that a more thorough understanding of the neural mechanisms of Gf 
may require tests and analysis techniques (e.g., exploratory factor analysis) sensitive to 
identifying various sub-domains of intelligence.   
Varieties of intelligence have been psychometrically described within several 
frameworks and taxonomies. The Cattel-Horn-Carrol (CHC) framework (Carroll, 1993; Horn & 
Noll, 1997; McGrew, 2009) is perhaps the most widely accepted psychometric-based theory of 
intelligence and posits at least nine broad domains of intelligence (including Gf), with dozens of 
narrow domains nested under them. Our factor analysis reveals that tests of quantitative and 
verbal reasoning split into separate factors, which is consistent with the specification of 
quantitative reasoning as a narrow ability feeding into Gf in the CHC framework (McGrew, 
2009). Moreover, re-analysis of the WAIS-IV intelligence battery using a 5-factor (instead of 4-
factor) structure (Benson, et al., 2010; van Aken et al., 2015; Weiss et al., 2013) matches this 
psychometric description, revealing a quantitative reasoning sub-factor nested beneath Gf 
(Benson et al., 2010; Weiss et al., 2013). 
The exploratory factor analysis we present here bears some resemblance to the CHC 
framework: BOMAT and Letter Sets together may resemble a more broad Gf factor combining 
verbal and spatial reasoning (this factor accounts for the most variance in our Gf test battery); 
Number Series primarily contributes to a quantitative reasoning factor (although not explicitly 
nested beneath the first factor, it accounts for less total variance in the Gf test battery). In the full 
sample, BOMAT loads primarily with Letter Sets, but also with Number Series (Table 3). This is 
consistent with previous results demonstrating that the Ravens Progressive Matricies (RPM), 
which is similar to the BOMAT, shares variance with both Letter Sets (Hambrick, 2003) and 
Number Series (Ackerman et al, 2002). Because the BOMAT has shared variance with both our 
spatial and quantitative reasoning components, it is likely that both are necessary for performing 
this test. Upon splitting our sample between males and females, BOMAT loads less on 
quantitative reasoning in males, but more on quantitative reasoning in females. Previous studies 
suggest that males perform better on quantitative reasoning (Geary, Saults, Liu, & Hoard, 
2000), whereas females exhibit an advantage in verbal reasoning (Halpern, 2012). These 
relative strengths may even exist on an androgynous continuum, in which the degree of 
testosterone exposure in infancy predicts whether the patern of cognitive performance is more 
male-like with higher quantitative performance, or more female-like with higher verbal 
performance (Luxen & Buunk, 2005). In our sample, although males showed an advantage in 
quantitative reasoning ability, results from both sexes demonstrate that the quantitative 
reasoning is positively correlated with brain volume, specifically gray matter (GM) volume. Some 
research has reported evidence that intelligence is more strongly related to gray matter 
structure in males and white matter structure in females (Gur et al., 1999; Haier, Jung, Yeo, 
Head & Alkire, 2005); however, our data did not reveal this pattern of results, and instead 
suggest that the largest magnitude of correlation is between quantitative reasoning and GM 
volume for both males and females (Table 7).  
While the CHC framework describes domains of intelligence derived from a broad array 
of tests, sub-domains of Gf have been previously characterized through factor analysis of item-
level responses on the RPM. In addition to a perceptual or Gestalt factor, two distinct analytical 
factors have been identified (Lynn & Irwing, 2004; Mackintosh & Bennett, 2005). The first of 
these factors relates to verbal-analytic reasoning and exhibits no sex differences. The second 
analytic factor exhibts a male advantage (Mackintosh & Bennett, 2005). Interestingly,

performance on this factor correlates with math ability in males but not in females, suggesting 
that males may solve these particular problems by employing specific cognitive processes 
related to mathematical reasoning or translation of problems into mathematical terminology, 
whereas females may employ more general cognitive abilities (Plaisted, Bell, & Mackintosh, 
2011). These findings suggest that the verbal-analytic factor may provide a more representative, 
global measurement of Gf, characterizing reasoning abilities that do not differ by sex (Plaisted, 
Bell, & Mackintosh, 2011). 
 
A comparison between this literature and our results reveals similar patterns. As with the 
second analytic component (Mackintosh & Bennett, 2005), sex differences are observed in our 
sample for the Number Series test, which principally contributes to our quantitative reasoning Gf 
factor.  Moreover, factor analysis for males only showed that performance on the Number 
Series test is distinct from performance on the BOMAT, whereas for females the Number Series 
test loaded with the BOMAT (Table 6). The BOMAT is closely related to the RPM, which is 
believed to be an accurate measurement of a general cognitive process that underscores 
intelligence (Jensen, 1998). These results therefore support the possibility that females may 
have been more likely to use general fluid reasoning processes to complete the Number Series 
test, whereas males may have employed more specific cognitive processes related to 
mathematical reasoning, though further experiments designed to specifically test this hypothesis 
are necessary.  
In contrast to the Number Series test, the Letter Sets test and the BOMAT test exhibit no 
sex differences and contribute to the verbal/spatial reasoning component. This component 
resembles the verbal-analytic reasoning factor derived from the RPM, which does not exhibit 
sex differences and may reflect a more general cognitive process (Plaisted, Bell, & Mackintosh, 
2011). In our data, we observe positive correlations between NAA and verbal/spatial reasoning; 
thus, NAA concentration may be sensitive to general cognitive processes that underscores fluid 
intelligence. In our data, brain volume correlated positively with the quantitative reasoning 
factor; thus, brain size may be more sensitive to specific cognitive processes that differ between 
sexes and that do not contribute significantly to general intelligence (Burgaleta et al., 2012).   
Our measurements of NAA were taken from medial parietal gray matter and the 
posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). The current results suggest that the oxidative metabolism in 
the PCC may also be sensitive to fluid cognitive processes. The Parieto-Frontal Integration 
Theory of intelligence proposes a four-stage information processing model of intelligence 
(Colom et al., 2009). In the first two stages, sensory information is initially processed, integrated 
across modalities, and abstracted. In the final two stages the frontal and parietal regions interact 
to form hypotheses and form and inhibit responses. The relationship of the PCC to regions 
involved in these final two stages, in concert with our results demonstrating PCC NAA to predict 
fluid reasoning ability, suggest that oxidative metabolism in the PCC may be reflective of high 
functioning in the frontal-parietal network responsible for hypothesis and response formation. 
Furthermore, our results provide preliminary evidence that this network of brain regions may be 
less related to quantitative reasoning and more exclusively related to verbal and/or spatial 
reasoning processes (perhaps depending on sex). Recent work suggests that sub components 
of intelligence are indeed fractioned across different, unique brain networks (Hampshire, 
Highfield, Parkin, & Owen, 2012).

4.2 Limitations and future directions 
The additional domains of cognition measured by our battery may provide clues about the 
relationship of NAA to Gf However, our battery did not include other cognitive faculties that may 
be of particular relevance for understanding the NAA-Gf relationship. For example, some 
evidence suggests that NAA may be sensitive to processing speed as measured by 
performance on timed tests (Jung et al., 1999), owing to its role as a precursor for myelin in WM 
(Moffett et al., 2007), though a recent report did not find support for this hypothesis (Patel et al., 
2014). It is possible that different processing speed demands, or interactions between NAA 
concentration and processing speed demands may factor into our reported dissociation. Without 
processing speed measures, our data can not account for this possibility; thus, future studies 
will benefit from including a wider array of tests to help account for these and other possibilities.  
Future studies may also benefit from experiments designed to more fully characterize the 
the water signal that is used to normalize the NAA signal. Such experiments are motivated by 
the fact that creatine and choline, which also show weak correlations with Verbal/Spatial 
reasoning, are normalized by the same water signal. To learn whether this water signal may be 
contributing to the observed correlations, future experiments can include direct measurements 
of the relaxation properties of the water and the volume of NMR-visible water in the voxel 
(Gasparovic et al., 2009), thereby avoiding the need to assume the same literature values for 
these properties in all subjects. Additionally, future studies will benefit from multi-voxel MRS 
techniques providing measurement of NAA in a variety of brain regions (Jung et al., 1999, 
Nikolaidis, et al., 2016). This information should be combined with other types of imaging data 
including regionally specific MRI measures of volumetrics in brain regions specifically linked to 
intelligence, structural white matter integrity between such regions (via DTI), or perhaps 
functional connectivity between regions (via resting state fMRI) to disentangle how regional 
neurometabolites, structure, and function together support Gf.  
Finally, studies seeking to better understand intelligence and its relationship to brain 
metabolites should investigate whether controlled interventions can produce changes in NAA 
concentration, and critically, whether these changes are associated with improvements in 
intelligence. Whether or not such interventions are efficacious may further inform the clinical 
relevancy of these biomarkers to diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and autism spectrum 
disorder, in which both brain volume and NAA concentrations are altered (Corrigan et al., 2013; 
Fox & Schott, 2004; Pfefferbaum, et al., 1999; Piven, Arndt, Bailey, Havercamp, Andreasen, & 
Palmer, 1995).  
5 Conclusion 
To our knowledge, this is the largest study investigating the relationship between the 
concentration of the brain metabolite NAA and Gf. Despite years of research consistently 
demonstrating positive correlations between brain volume and intelligence, our results showed 
that NAA concentration and brain volume are dissociable biomarkers of facets of Gf 
independent of working memory: NAA positively correlated with verbal/spatial Gf whereas brain 
volume correlated with quantitative Gf. Additionally, this pattern of results was observed for 
males and females separately. This finding suggests that different brain biomarkers may 
uniquely reflect different aspects of human cognition, and that a complete understanding of the 
neurobiological bases of intelligence requires a complete characterization of such biomarkers.
