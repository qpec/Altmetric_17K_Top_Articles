Abstract
Music has been identified as a strength in people with Autism Spectrum Disorder; however, there is currently no
neuroscientific evidence supporting its benefits. Given its universal appeal, intrinsic reward value and ability to modify
brain and behaviour, music may be a potential therapeutic aid in autism. Here we evaluated the neurobehavioural
outcomes of a music intervention, compared to a non-music control intervention, on social communication and brain
connectivity in school-age children (ISRCTN26821793). Fifty-one children aged 6–12 years with autism were
randomized to receive 8–12 weeks of music (n = 26) or non-music intervention (n = 25). The music intervention
involved use of improvisational approaches through song and rhythm to target social communication. The non-music
control was a structurally matched behavioural intervention implemented in a non-musical context. Groups were
assessed before and after intervention on social communication and resting-state functional connectivity of fronto-
temporal brain networks. Communication scores were higher in the music group post-intervention (difference score
= 4.84, P = .01). Associated post-intervention resting-state brain functional connectivity was greater in music vs. non-
music groups between auditory and subcortical regions (z = 3.94, P < .0001) and auditory and fronto-motor regions (z
= 3.16, P < .0001). Post-intervention brain connectivity was lower between auditory and visual regions in the music
compared to the non-music groups, known to be over-connected in autism (z = 4.01, P < .00001). Post-intervention
brain connectivity in the music group was related to communication improvement (z = 3.57, P < .0001). This study
provides the first evidence that 8–12 weeks of individual music intervention can indeed improve social
communication and functional brain connectivity, lending support to further investigations of neurobiologically
motivated models of music interventions in autism.
Introduction
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelop-
mental condition characterized by social communication
difficulties and restricted and repetitive behaviours among
strengths in varied domains1. ASD is highly prevalent but
there is considerable heterogeneity in its aetiology, clinical
presentation and underlying brain connectivity1,2. Con-
sequently, a variety of behavioural and psychosocial
treatments are sought by families3. However, there is little
consensus on which treatments are most effective4. Thus,
a diagnosis of ASD is associated with substantial costs to
the individual, the family and the community5.
ASD is a lifelong condition with a median age of diag-
nosis >4 years6, although most current intervention stra-

 families face significant challenges during developmental
transitions7.
School-age
children
in
particular
often
remain unengaged in social settings, reducing opportu-
nities for socio-communicative development8,9. This has
led to investigations of alternate and creative means of
expression such as music that might improve social
communication,
increasing
prospects
for meaningful
relationships.
Furthermore, cross-culturally
applicable
music-based interventions hold potential for scalability at
home, school and global community settings10.
Previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of music
interventions for ASD have reported positive effects of
music on emotional engagement, social interaction,
communication and parent–child relationships11,12, sug-
gesting that musical activities in a therapeutic context can
promote measurable behavioural changes in children with
ASD. Strengths in music processing have been noted
since the first description of ASD13 and many studies have
reported intact or enhanced musical skills such as abso-
lute pitch, enhanced melodic memory and contour-
processing in children with ASD14–16. Greater brain
responses to song versus speech in fronto-temporal brain
regions17,18 and intact emotional responsiveness to music
have also been demonstrated19. Supporting anecdotal
reports from parents and caregivers have described the
profound effects music has had on children with ASD20.
The positive impact of music on social skills has been
demonstrated beyond ASD21,22. Typically developing
children are more likely to play with another following a
shared musical experience23 and joint musical interac-
tions can enhance emotional empathy, prosociality and
bonding in children24–26. More recently, neuroimaging
studies have shown that participating in musical activities
engages a multimodal network of brain regions involved
in hearing, movement, emotion, pleasure and memory27–
31, thus allowing transfer of music-related therapeutic
effects to non-musical domains32 through structural and
functional brain changes33,34. However, a direct link
between effects of music interventions and changes in the
brain is yet to be demonstrated in autism35,36 and was our
aim here.
Altered intrinsic brain connectivity is a hallmark of
ASD. Both over-connectivity and under-connectivity have
been reported, in particular, under-connectivity of fronto-
temporal and cortico-subcortical networks and over-
connectivity of sensory networks may be considered
potential treatment targets37–40 given their associations
with verbal and social communication skills in autism18,41.
Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
(rsfMRI) allows measurement of intrinsic brain con-
nectivity by computing temporal correlations of sponta-
neous
blood-oxygen-level-dependent
(BOLD)
signals
among spatially distributed brain regions and may be a
promising target of music-induced neuroplasticity40,42.
The use of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) as
an outcome measure for intervention studies, particularly
for clinical populations, has been recommended since it
affords the advantage of being task-independent, has high
test–retest reliability, limited practice effects and can
provide reliable estimates of functional brain connectivity
corresponding to underlying anatomy43.
Currently, evidence for effectiveness of music interven-
tions is limited and there is no neuroscientific basis for its
use in ASD. However, given the impact of music on social
functioning and brain connectivity, alongside atypicalities
in these areas in ASD, music-based activities may restore
altered brain connectivity and social difficulties in ASD.
Synthesizing findings from previous research, two possible
mechanisms for such music-induced neuroplasticity and
its impact on social functioning may be proposed:32,36,44,45
(1) top–down reward-based cortical modulation to rein-
force learning of non-musical behaviours such as social
interactions through the intrinsic reward value of music,
(2) bottom–up sensorimotor integration through sound
and auditory–motor entrainment of neural networks
through synchronization leading to modulation of atypical
sensory processing, which in turn may improve social
communication41,46. Our goal was to investigate whether
music-based interventions can indeed alter spontaneous
rsfMRI signals, leading to improved functioning in ASD
based on one of the above hypotheses.
The specific aim of this RCT was to investigate whether
8–12 weeks of a music-based intervention (compared to a
non-music control intervention) can improve social
communication, family quality of life (FQoL) and func-
tional brain connectivity in school-age children with ASD.
This would provide evidence for an effective, inexpensive,
easy-to-administer
and
relatively
non-specialized
strength-based intervention that may be scaled in varied
settings across cultures, addressing the need for globally
applicable ASD intervention models10.
Materials and methods
Study design
We report an assessor-blinded, parallel-group RCT47,48
of a music intervention (MT) compared to a non-music
control intervention (NM) for improving social commu-
nication
and
fronto-temporal
brain
connectivity
in
school-age children with ASD. The trial (isrctn.org:
ISRCTN26821793) was conducted between April and
December 2016 in Montreal, Canada with ethics approval
from the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) at
McGill
University.
Written

consent
was
obtained from parents/guardians of participants.

 criteria for ASD49, were screened from January to August
2016 (Fig. 1). Exclusion criteria were (1) individual music
therapy within 6 months prior to study, (2) private
musical lessons for a cu mulative period of 1 year prior to
study, (3) group music therapy in school; (4) <35 weeks of
gestation, (5) hearing disorders or (6) a medical history of
neurological disease. Power analysis using evidence-
based effect size estimation11 suggested that for a large
effect (d = 0.8) of music therapy on social communica-
tion, detectable with 80% power at P < .05, a sample of n
= 50 (25 per arm) would be required.
Baseline assessment
Assessment at baseline consisted of two sessions. In the
first session, detailed demographics on socioeconomic
status50 (SES), handedness51, music experience history
and past and current intervention history of the child
were obtained. Participant diagnosis was confirmed using
a best-estimate diagnosis of ASD supported by an ADOS
(Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale52), Autism Diag-
nostic Interview–Revised53 or Childhood Autism Rating
Scale54 and detailed clinical assessment report. Addi-
tionally, parent-reported behavioural outcomes on Social
Responsiveness Scale (SRS-II55), the Children’s Commu-
nication Checklist (CCC-256), the maladaptive behaviour
subscale of the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales
(VABS-MB57) as well as the Beach Family Quality of Life
Scale (FQoL58) were obtained. Children’s cognitive ability
was assessed using the Wechsler’s Abbreviated Intelli-
gence Scale (WASI-II59). If the child had completed an
intelligence quotient (IQ) test (WASI-I/II/WISC-IV/V)
within 2 years of the study, available scores were used.
Children’s language ability was assessed using the Sen-
tence Repetition subtest of the Clinical Evaluation of
Language
Fundamentals
(CELF-460,61)
and
receptive
vocabulary was measured using the Peabody Picture

 Vocabulary Test (PPVT-462). Musical ability was assessed
using the Montreal Battery for Evaluation of Musical

are provided in Table 1.
In the second session, participants completed a 20-
minute MRI scan in a 3 Tesla Siemens Magnetom Tim-
Trio scanner with a 32-channel head coil at the MNI.
During this scan, participants were asked to fixate on a
cross-hair on the screen. Resting-state BOLD echo-planar
images were obtained in 38 slices with a 3.5 mm3 voxel
resolution, covering the entire brain (TR = 2340 ms,
TE = 30 ms, matrix size, 64 × 64; field of view (FOV),
224 mm; flip angle 90°). One hundred and forty volumes
were
obtained

 completed a high-resolution sagittal T1-weighted anato-
mical scan with a voxel resolution of 1 mm3 and an
acceleration factor of 2. Participants with their parents
underwent a detailed orientation procedure before the
MRI scan to ensure comfort and compliance and to
maximize good quality outcomes64. Audio-visual media
aids and mock scanner trials were used in most cases to
motivate the participants. Participants’ wakefulness and
motion during the actual scans was monitored using an
MRI-compatible infra-red camera.
Randomization and blinding
Fifty-one participants were randomized to MT (n = 26)
or NM (n = 25) using the covariate-adaptive method65
where the first 20 participants were randomized using
simple coin toss and remaining 31 by the MinimPy soft-
ware (http://minimpy.sourceforge.net/) by the first author
(M.S.), who was not involved in assessing behavioural
outcomes. MinimPy is a free, open-source, desktop pro-
gram implemented in Python, which allows random
allocation of subjects to treatment groups in a clinical trial
using a stochastic covariate-adaptive minimization algo-
rithm66. The success of randomization was assessed by
comparing baseline similarity of intervention groups. All
other assessors and authors were blind to group allocation
information. Our attempt to blind parents (who assessed
parent-rated outcomes) was only partially successful, with
31 out of the 51 parents reporting awareness of group
allocation. Data were independently double entered to
ensure accuracy and stored on an electronic server with
restricted, password-controlled access.
Interventions and fidelity
Both interventions (Fig. S1) involved 45-minute indivi-
dual weekly sessions conducted over 8–12 weeks by the
same
accredited
therapist
(M.T.)
using
established
approaches. Using a child-centric approach, MT made use
of musical instruments, songs and rhythmic cues while
targeting
communication,
turn-taking,
sensorimotor
integration, social appropriateness and musical interac-
tion47,67–69. NM was designed as a structurally matched
“active comparison” play-based intervention to control for
non-specific factors, such as positive treatment expec-
tancies, intervention support, therapist attention and
emotional engagement. Both interventions were con-
ducted in the same setting and targeted similar outcomes
using
theoretically
motivated
approaches70
such
as
creating a shared experience, building meaningful rela-
tionships and emphasizing self-expression71 through the
use of varied activities targeting common goal such as
verbal and social communication, multisensory integra-
tion and emotional regulation (SI Table S1). The primary
difference was the use of music as a central component in
MT. All sessions were video-recorded to assess treatment
fidelity72 (Supplementary Information).
Outcomes
Behavioural outcomes
Primary behavioural outcomes included a social com-
munication battery consisting of the CCC-2 to measure
pragmatic communication, SRS-II to measure symptom
severity and PPVT-4 to measure receptive vocabulary.
Secondary outcomes were FQoL and the maladaptive
behaviours subdomain of the VABS. Outcomes were
selected to provide both direct and parent-reported eva-
luations of treatment-related change using measures that
have good psychometric properties, limited practice
effects and applicability to a wide range of individuals73,74
and were collected at baseline and post-intervention for n
= 50 participants (Supplementary Information).
Statistical analysis
Behavioural outcomes were analysed by fitting linear
mixed-effects
models
(LMEMs)
with
restriction
maximum-likelihood estimation to cope with missing
data,
inhomogeneity
of
dependent-variable-variance
across factor levels and unequal group size. LMEMs
with treatment group (MT, NM), timepoint (baseline,
post-intervention) and their interaction as well as parti-
cipant intercept as random effect were estimated for all
primary and secondary behavioural outcomes75. Prior to
analysis, data were checked for normality. A group×-
timepoint interaction indicating a change in MT vs. NM
post-intervention at P < .016 (Bonferroni-corrected from
alpha-level of P = .05 to account for three primary beha-
vioural outcomes) was considered significant. Clinical
significance was limited to changes from baseline to post-
intervention within MT or significant difference between
MT and NM post-intervention as confirmed by post hoc
Tukey tests at alpha-level of P = .05. An intention-to-treat
analysis was carried out, whereby missing data from any
drop-out participants was replaced with data at baseline.
Both unstandardized (beta-coefficients and mean differ-
ence) scores76 and standardized effect sizes (standardized
mean difference, Cohen’s d) are reported since standar-
dized effect sizes are often influenced by study design and
complexity of models used. Standardized effects sizes are
calculated as the difference in change scores between
groups divided by the pooled within- and between-group
standard deviation77. The unstandardized measure is a
simple effect size (with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)) in
terms of mean difference and does not depend on var-
iance estimates78. All statistical analyses were done in R
v3.3.479.

 Neuroimaging outcomes
Primary neuroimaging outcomes were intrinsic func-
tional brain connectivity of fronto-temporal brain net-
works measured using rsfMRI at baseline and post-
intervention. RSFC methods provide an approach for
investigating how musical engagement may alter func-
tional connectivity among several brain regions. RSFC
metrics of inter-regional correlations specifically afford
the advantage of being task-independent, have high
test–retest reliability and provide reliable estimates of
brain functional connectivity80. RSFC metrics also have
limited practice effects and may provide an objective
method to measure response-to-intervention40. Here we
tested the extent to which music alters fronto-temporal
RSFC in six fronto-temporal seed regions.
Image preprocessing
Resting-state images were first preprocessed using FSL
(v. 5.0.9; www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk, FMRIB’s Software Library,
FMRIB, Oxford, UK)81,82 via the SeeBARS pipeline
developed at the Center for Research on Brain, Language
and Music83. Image preprocessing steps consisted of
removal of the first five volumes in each scan series as well
as removal of non-brain tissue using BET81, slice-time
correction, motion correction (using a six-parameter
affine transformation implemented in FLIRT, global
intensity
normalization,
spatial
smoothing
(Gaussian
kernel of FWHM = 6 mm), temporal high-pass filtering
(100 s) and temporal band-pass filtering (0.01–0.1 Hz). To
achieve the transformation between the low-resolution
functional data and standard space (MNI152: average T1
brain image constructed from 152 normal subjects), two
transformations were performed: (1) T2*-weighted image
to T1-weighted structural image (using a 7 degree of
freedom (DOF) transformation) and (2) T1-weighted
structural image to average standard space (using a 12
DOF linear affine transformation, voxel size = 2 × 2 ×
2 mm3). In addition, physiological noise was removed
using the method described by Vahdat and colleagues83.
The global signal was calculated by averaging the time
series over all voxels in the brain. In total, 18 nuisance
regressors were used: white matter, cerebrospinal fluid,
global signal and their derivatives, and six motion para-
meters and their derivatives in the first-level analysis84,85.
Additional motion scrubbing was done using guidelines in
Power et al. (2012)86. Volumes with framewise displace-
ment (FD) = 0.5 mm or DVARS = 50 (the spatial root
mean square of the data after temporal differencing) were
masked from whole-brain analysis. Participants with >35%
volumes censored at either timepoint were excluded from
further analysis (n = 6, MT = 2, NM = 4).
Statistical analysis
Seeds were defined as 6 mm spheres around coordinates
in the left and right Heschl’s gyrus (HG; ±46 −18 10), left
and right inferior frontal gyrus (±50 18 7) and left and
right temporal pole (TP; ±38 10 −28; Fig. S3). These seeds
are known to anchor fronto-temporal networks involved
in language and communication and altered in ASD87.
The timeseries for each of the six seeds was used to
generate individual participant-level maps using whole-
brain
general
linear
models
at
baseline
and
post-
intervention. The unthresholded participant-level maps
were then entered into a group-level analysis. To assess
potential differences between groups at baseline, inde-
pendent sample t tests were computed for maps from all
seeds. No baseline differences between groups on any of
the six RSFC networks was found (all P > .05). To com-
pare groups post-intervention, we used adjusted analysis
of covariance (ANCOVA) with post-intervention RSFC as
the dependent variable and intervention group, mean-
centred baseline RSFC, age, IQ and mean FD86 as cov-
ariates. Using covariate-adjusted ANCOVA models are
more powerful as they can account for baseline imbalance
and correlation between baseline and post-intervention
measures, increase statistical power and minimize bia-
ses88–92. Z-scores of parameter estimates were used to
measure connectivity strength. In RSFC maps where a
difference between groups was observed, we evaluated
whether post-intervention RSFC was related to improve-
ment in behavioural outcomes (measured by difference
scores)
in
a
whole-brain
analysis.
Z-statistics
were
extracted for each participant from the post-intervention
RSFC maps and used in a linear regression model to
evaluate strength of the association between RSFC and
behavioural improvement. To account for multiple com-
parisons, random-field theory using a cluster-forming
threshold of P < .001 was applied93. To account for six
seeds, a Bonferroni correction was used and a final alpha-
level of P = .00016 was used for significance testing. All
locations are described in MNI coordinates.
Results
Participants
One hundred and eleven children meeting diagnosis for
ASD were screened in the community, of which 60 did
not meet study criteria or declined to participate (further
details are provided in Fig. 1). Fifty-one participants in the
age range 6–12 years (mean age = 10.25 years, 8 females)
were assessed at baseline and randomly assigned to music
(MT; n = 26) or non-music (NM; n = 25) intervention
groups (Fig. 1,S1). Assessment at baseline consisted of two
sessions: (1) first, detailed demographics, diagnostic
reports and baseline measurements of behavioural out-
comes were obtained (Table 1). (2) In the second session,
anatomical and rsfMRI brain images were obtained on a

 3 Tesla MRI scanner. Participants did not differ at base-
line on age, sex, language, motor skills, IQ, SES or musical
ability and completed an average of 10.3 therapy sessions
(n = 5 participants had <10 sessions) during the study
(Table 1). Fifty participants completed follow-up assess-
ments with one drop-out whose baseline data was used
for analysis.
Treatment fidelity
Treatment fidelity72 of delivery of both interventions
was assessed using 103 out of the 527 video-recorded
intervention sessions by two raters blind to session order,
not involved in the trial and demonstrating high inter-
rater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.91, P
< .001). There was high adherence to treatment protocols,
process fidelity (80–100% with no difference between
groups; P = .24) and content fidelity (>75% with no dif-
ference between groups; P = .16) of delivered intervention
with no difference in implementation fidelity across MT
and NM (Supplementary Information).
Behavioural outcomes
Using LMEMs, we found that MT, relative to NM,
showed improvements in communication on the CCC-
2, indicated by a significant group×timepoint interac-
tion corrected for multiple outcomes (β = −1.35, P

test, t = 1.43, P = .024, Fig. 2a). The simple effect size
calculated as a mean difference between MT and NM
scores from baseline to post-intervention was 4.84 (95%
CI: 0.76–8.92) with a larger proportion in the MT group
(15/26) compared to the NM group (5/24) showing an
improvement. An exploratory analysis of scaled subtests
of the CCC-2 (not subjected to correction for multiple
comparisons) revealed that these differences stemmed
from tests of structural language, Speech (P = .01) and
Semantics
(P = .046);
a
pragmatics
subtest,
Inap-
propriate Initiations (P = .006); and two autism-relevant
subtests (not included in the CCC-2 composite): Social
Relations (P = .048) and Interests (P = .02). There was
no group×timepoint interaction on the SRS-II55 t-
scores (β = −0.04, P = .92; mean difference = 0.65, 95%
CI:−3.25 to 4.1), or PPVT-462 standard scores (β = 0.15,
P = .78; mean difference = 0.03, 95% CI:−4.32 to 4.38;
Fig. 2b, c). There was, however, a significant group×-
timepoint interaction on parent-reported FQoL (β =
−1.9, P = .01, Fig. 2d) with mean difference = 7.06
favouring MT (95% CI: 0.79 to 13.33) even though no
post hoc tests were significant. Additionally, both
groups showed reduction in maladaptive behaviours on
the VABS post-intervention (β = 0.22, P = .01, Fig. 2e,
Table 2, SI Table S2).
Brain connectivity outcomes
There were no baseline differences between groups on
any of the six RSFC networks (all P > .05). Using
covariate-adjusted ANCOVA models, we found greater
RSFC post-intervention in the MT group compared
with NM between auditory seeds (left and right HG)
and striatal and motor regions (right HG: z = 3.94,
P = .000019, left HG: z = 3.79, P = .00009, Fig. 3a, b, SI
Table S3) and reduced RSFC in MT between auditory
seeds (left HG and right TP) and visual regions (left HG:
z = 3.39, P < .00001, right TP: z = 4.01, P < .00001,
Fig. 3d, e, SI Table S3).
To evaluate whether changes in RSFC were related to
improvements in behavioural outcome, we tested whole-
brain models with CCC-2 improvement (CCC-2Post-
Intervention−CCC-2Baseline) as covariate of interest for the
three seeds (left HG, right HG and right TP) where sig-
nificant differences between groups was found. Greater
RSFC post-intervention between left HG and subcortical
thalamic and striatal regions was related to greater
improvement on CCC-2 scores (z = 3.57, P < .0001, Fig.
3c). Lower post-intervention RSFC between right HG and
visual areas was related to greater improvement in CCC-2
scores (z = 3.64, P < .001, Fig. 3f).
Discussion
Individuals with ASD have a unique profile of strengths
amid limitations, which can be harnessed to design
treatment paradigms that improve functional outcomes94.
Given their universal appeal, intrinsic reward value and
ability to modify brain and behaviour, musical activities
have been proposed as a potential strength-based reha-
bilitation tool for ASD22,36,95. In the current trial, we
demonstrate that 8–12 weeks of music intervention can
indeed alter intrinsic brain connectivity and improve
parent-reported outcomes in social communication and
FQoL in school-age children with ASD.
Improvements in social communication were found on
the CCC-2 from baseline to post-intervention in MT vs.
NM, with a medium-sized positive effect (d = 0.34).
Improvements were specific to pragmatics, reduction of
inappropriate initiations and better social relations and
interests. These findings are consistent with the idea that
music employs a structured approach to social commu-
nication, which may otherwise be hindered by sensory and
social difficulties12,36. Despite being modestly sized, these
effects are highly specific to MT given the comparable
structure of the control intervention and may have pro-
mising clinical and policy implications96. No MT-specific
improvements were found on SRS-II or PPVT-4. Despite
convergence between the SRS-II and CCC-2 and similar
susceptibility to assessor-blinding biases, the SRS-II is a

 measure of ASD symptom severity, whereas the CCC-2 is
a pragmatic communication measure, indicating limited
effects of MT on reducing ASD symptom severity or
improving receptive vocabulary.
We also found a positive effect of MT on FQoL (d =
0.57). The family is the primary support system for indi-
viduals with ASD throughout their lifespan. However,
parents of children with ASD experience high levels of
stress that can negatively impact well-being97, making
FQoL a critical component in evaluating treatment out-
comes. Although both groups received a form of inter-
ventional support, only parents of children in MT
reported increases in FQoL, particularly on items on
family interaction, cohesion and coping and benefits of
disability-related supports.
Recently, Bieleninik and colleagues98 published a mul-
ticentre trial of improvisational music therapy for children
aged 4–7 years and found no reductions in ASD symp-
toms on the ADOS Social Affect domain after 5 months
of therapy, compared to standard care. The authors sug-
gest that this could be due to variability across therapists,
clinical assessors99 and the choice of ADOS as outcome
measure, particularly because no previous well-controlled
and blinded intervention studies3 have found treatment
effects on the ADOS. While this trial demonstrates the
global feasibility of implementing music therapy in large-
scale international settings, it also indicates the impor-
tance of choosing appropriate outcome measures for
psychosocial interventions in heterogeneous neurodeve-
lopmental populations. The focus should not only be on
symptom reduction but also on overall quality of life and
functional improvements. In turn, outcomes that are
malleable through intervention can inform future targets
of research.
To complement behavioural improvements, we present
the first evidence that music intervention alters functional
brain activity in ASD leading to functional communica-
tion gains. Specifically, MT, relative to NM, increased
functional connectivity between bilateral primary auditory
cortex and subcortical and motor regions (often reduced
in ASD)100 and reduced over-connectivity between audi-
tory and visual-association areas38. Importantly, changes
in brain connectivity were related to improvements in
children’s communication skills after MT (Fig. 3c–f).

 top–down processing. However, it is still not clear whe-
ther an increased reliance on bottom–up sensory pro-
cessing and hence, sensory over-connectivity, is a cause or
consequence of atypical top–down cortical modula-
tion41,46. As a result, social communication impairments
may result from alterations not just in the brain’s “social”
network” but in domain-general disconnections in sen-
sorimotor and cognitive functions, which are building
blocks of later social skills46. In line with this idea, we find
that engaging in musical activities can directly influence
auditory–motor connections in the brains of children
with ASD similar to effects of musical training in neuro-
typical populations27,30,31. Previous studies have reported
that early motor difficulties are often predictive of later
social communication impairments in ASD101. Thus
interventions targeting motor skills may impact later
social outcomes. It is important to note that our partici-
pants did not exhibit significant motor deficits and that
the two intervention groups did not differ in their range of
motor skills (Table 1). Thus any gains observed in
auditory–motor connectivity in the MT group are not
driven by group differences in motor skills and are specific
to the music intervention. Furthermore, our findings show
that music might play a modulating role in reducing the
over-connectivity between sensory cortices, subsequently
improving communication processes102,103. In light of
mechanisms of music-induced neuroplasticity introduced
earlier, our findings support bottom–up integration of
sensorimotor brain networks leading to improved social
functioning rather than top–down music-based reward36.

 Music interventions may thus have a positive influence on
social
functioning,
possibly
though
modulation
of
domain-general sensory and cognitive processes, which
are often atypical ASD41,46. Future research should focus
on better understanding the neural mechanisms under-
lying music-related changes in brain connectivity and its
impact on social behaviour.
Evidence-based behavioural and psychosocial interven-
tions for school-age children have received limited
attention3.
Neuroscience-informed
support
for
such
interventions offers the opportunity to integrate brain
development
with
behavioural
approaches,
allowing
development of individualized treatment paradigms104. A
strength of the current study is the use of neuroimaging to
support improvements in behavioural outcomes resulting
from MT. Consequently, the sample size (n = 51) is quite
modest. Future work should focus on identifying indivi-
duals whose profiles may benefit most from music and
integrate neuroimaging in multisite trials of such inter-
ventions. Inclusion of more direct observation-based
outcomes and the role of mediators and moderators
(e.g. quality of therapeutic relationship, cognitive, lan-
guage and motor profiles, symptom level and musical
interest of the participant) on short- and long-term out-
comes will also be crucial to further the evidence base for
music-based interventions.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that
8–12 weeks of music intervention (relative to non-music
behavioural intervention) can improve parent-reported
social communication, FQoL and intrinsic brain con-
nectivity in school-age children, thus supporting the use
of music as a therapeutic tool for individuals with ASD.
