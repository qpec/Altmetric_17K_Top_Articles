INTRODUCTION: Regenerative therapies
based on cell replacement hold promise for
the treatment of a range of age-related degen-
erative diseases but are limited by unfavorable
microenvironments in degenerating tissues.
A promising strategy to improve success is to
harness endogenous repair mechanisms that
promote tissue integrity and function. Innate
immune cells are central to such repair mech-
anisms because they coordinate local and sys-
temic responses to tissue injury by secreting
inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals
in a context-dependent manner. A proper bal-
ance between these opposing phenotypes of
innate immune cells is essential for efficient
tissue repair, and immune modulation may be
an effective way to promote repair and enhance
regenerative therapies. Here, we identified a
new evolutionarily conserved immune mod-
ulatory function for mesencephalic astrocyte-
derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) that biases
immune cells toward an anti-inflammatory
phenotype, thereby promoting tissue repair in
both vertebrates and invertebrates and en-
hancing retinal regenerative therapy.
RATIONALE: In Drosophila, interactions be-
tween damaged tissues and hemocytes are
essential for tissue repair. We used this model
to identify immune cell–derived factors with
immune modulatory activity that promote
tissue repair after retinal injury. The identi-
fication of MANF as such a factor prompted
us to test its role in mammalian retinal re-
pair and ask whether its immune modulatory
activity helped cell replacement therapies in
degenerating retinas.
RESULTS: Using a combination of transcrip-
tome analysis and genetic studies, we iden-
tified MANF as a hemocyte-derived factor that
is induced by platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGF)– and vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF)–related factor 1 (Pvf-1)/PDGF-
and VEGF-receptor related (PvR) signaling.
MANF was necessary and sufficient to pro-
mote retinal repair after
ultraviolet-light–induced
retinalinjuryinDrosophila.
MANF also had an auto-
crineimmune-modulatory
function in fly hemocytes,
which was necessary for
its tissue repair–promoting activity. This reg-
ulation and function of MANF was evolu-
tionarily conserved: Mouse photoreceptors
expressed PDGF-A (a Pvf-1 homolog) in re-
sponse to damage signals, which promoted
MANF expression in innate immune cells.
This PDGF-A/MANF signaling cascade was
required to limit photoreceptor apoptosis in
the retina. Exogenously supplied recombinant
MANF protected photoreceptors in several pa-
radigms of retinal injury and degeneration.
As in flies, this prorepair function was asso-
ciated with alternative activation of macro-
phages and microglia in the retina. Ablation
of CD11b+ immune cells and deletion of Cx3Cr1,
a chemokine receptor required for MANF-
induced alternative activation, prevented MANF-
induced repair. Thus, the protective effects of
MANF in retinal injury rely on its immune
modulatory activity. Finally, MANF supple-
mentation to photoreceptors transplanted into
congenitally blind mice increased integration
efficiency and accelerated and improved visual
function recovery.
CONCLUSION: Combining genetic studies in
invertebrates and vertebrates has rapidly iden-
tified factors with promising therapeutic po-
tential. Immune modulation is a promising
strategy to optimize regenerative therapies.
With its conserved immune modulatory func-
tion, MANF is a particularly promising molecule
that is likely to be useful for the treatment of
inflammatory conditions in many different dis-
ease contexts.▪

MANF in retinal repair. In Drosophila (left) or mouse (right), the damaged retina secretes Pvf-1/
PDGF-A, which acts on innate immune cells. MANF derived from innate immune cells (and other
sources) promotes phenotypic changes in immune cells as part of a mechanism required for tissue
repair. Therapeutically, MANF supplementation can delay retinal degeneration and improve the
success of cell-replacement regenerative therapies in the retina.

RETINAL REPAIR
Immune modulation by MANF
promotes tissue repair and
regenerative success in the retina

Regenerative therapies are limited by unfavorable environments in aging and diseased
tissues. A promising strategy to improve success is to balance inflammatory and
anti-inflammatory signals and enhance endogenous tissue repair mechanisms. Here, we
identified a conserved immune modulatory mechanism that governs the interaction
between damaged retinal cells and immune cells to promote tissue repair. In damaged
retina of flies and mice, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)–like signaling induced
mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) in innate immune cells.
MANF promoted alternative activation of innate immune cells, enhanced neuroprotection
and tissue repair, and improved the success of photoreceptor replacement therapies.
Thus, immune modulation is required during tissue repair and regeneration. This approach
may improve the efficacy of stem-cell–based regenerative therapies.
R
egenerative therapies based on cell re-
placement hold promise for the treatment
of a range of age-related degenerative dis-
eases (1, 2). Moreover, aged and diseased
tissues provide a poor microenvironment
for integration (3). A case in point is attempting
to regenerate the vertebrate retina, a tissue where
endogenous repair mechanisms are inefficient
and that is subject to a variety of irreversible
age-related degenerative pathologies. Human
pluripotent stem cells can provide a virtually
unlimited source of photoreceptors and retinal
pigment epithelial (RPE) cells for replacement
and restoration of vision (4), yet the poor in-
tegration efficiency of transplanted cells into
the host retina has limited clinical applications.
Retinal diseases targeted by this therapeutic ap-
proach, such as age-related macular degenera-
tion or retinitis pigmentosa, are characterized
by microglial activation and proinflammatory
microenvironments (5–9) that will negatively
affect integration and repair (3, 10).
Microglia, monocyte-derived macrophages,
and other innate immune cell types can both
promote and resolve inflammation. Managing
these inflammatory responses is essential for tis-
sue repair and regeneration (11). In the central
nervous system, resident (microglia) and invad-
ing innate immune cells orchestrate a complex
response to damage aimed at restoring tissue
integrity but can also promote damaging neuro-
inflammation (12–15). This antagonism is at
least in part a consequence of different states
of immune cell activation. Classical or M1 acti-
vation is associated with proinflammatory con-
ditions that can cause tissue damage, whereas
alternative or M2 activation is associated with
resolution of inflammation and tissue repair
(16, 17). This M1/M2 paradigm has been used
to describe outcomes of in vitro perturbation
of macrophages, yet there is evidence that mac-
rophages in vivo can adopt similar phenotypes
and functions (18, 19). Because of these opposing
effects of different immune cell phenotypes, im-
mune modulation rather than immune suppres-
sion may be an effective way to promote tissue
repair and improve regenerative therapies.
Studies in Drosophila have substantially ad-
vanced our understanding of tissue repair and
regeneration in metazoans (20–22). This work
has highlighted the critical role of the interac-
tion between hemocytes (Drosophila blood cells
with macrophage-like activities) and damaged
epithelia in the repair process. Hemocytes are
activated in response to tissue damage and co-
ordinate localized and systemic repair responses
(23–26) but have also been implicated in inflam-
matory processes in flies (27). A productive model
for the genetic dissection of tissue and hemocyte
interactions in repair processes is the pupal ret-
ina, which responds to ultraviolet (UV) damage
by inducing photoreceptor apoptosis in a dose-
dependent manner (28, 29). A paracrine inter-
action between UV-damaged photoreceptors and
hemocytes through the platelet-derived growth
factor (PDGF)– and vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF)–related factor 1 (Pvf-1) and PDGF-
and VEGF-receptor related (PvR) pathway gov-
erns repair of the damaged retina: Damaged
photoreceptors secrete Pvf-1 and activate PvR
in hemocytes, promoting repair of UV-induced
tissue damage (Fig. 1A) (26).
We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
on isolated hemocytes to identify PvR-dependent
genes encoding secreted proteins that were in-
duced after epithelial damage (fig. S1 and table
S1). Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic
factor (MANF) was found in this screen and, based
on its evolutionarily conserved neurotrophic ac-
tivity (30–32), we decided to explore its potential
as a retinal repair factor.
Hemocyte-derived MANF is activated
downstream of Pvf-1/PvR paracrine signaling
to promote retinal repair in Drosophila
We confirmed that MANF is expressed in fly
innate immune cells (hemocytes) using immu-
nohistochemistry of hemolymph smears from
late second-instar larvae (Fig. 1B, left). In these
smears, hemocytes were identified by green
fluorescent protein (GFP) expression driven by
the hemocyte-specific driver hemolectin:Gal4
(HmlD:Gal4) (33). MANF was also detected by
immunoblot in the plasma fraction of the hemo-
lymph, confirming its secretion (Fig. 1B, right).
Consistent with the RNA-seq data, reverse tran-
scription and real-time quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis revealed that
MANF mRNA levels were significantly higher
in hemocytes from UV-treated larvae compared
with untreated controls (Fig. 1C, left) and that
this induction was PvR dependent (Fig. 1C, right,
and figs. S1C and S2A). Overexpression of
Pvf-1 in the retina [using GMR:Gal4 (glass mul-
timer reporter) (34) as a driver] was sufficient
to induce MANF mRNA specifically in hemo-
cytes, in the absence of damage (Fig. 1D, left),
and was accompanied by a significant increase
in MANF protein in the hemolymph (Fig. 1D,
right, and fig. S2B).
Flies overexpressing MANF in hemocytes
(fig. S2C, left) showed significant tissue preserva-
tion after UV exposure, even after PvR knockdown
in hemocytes (26) (Fig. 1E, left and middle), with-
outaffectingPvRRNAiknockdownefficiency(fig.S2A).
This protective activity of hemocyte-derived MANF
was further confirmed in two genetic models of
retinal damage, in which degeneration is induced
by retinal (GMR driven) overexpression of the pro-
apoptotic gene grim or of mutant Rhodopsin
(Rh1G69D) (35, 36) (fig. S2, D and E).
Null mutations in the manf gene (manf mut96
and manf mut112) (31) are homozygous lethal at
early first-instar larval stages, yet MANF hetero-
zygotes [which express significantly lower levels
of MANF in hemocytes compared with wild type
(fig. S2F)] had a significantly increased tissue de-
generation response to UV (Fig. 1F, gray dots,
and fig. S2G). This increase in tissue loss could
be rescued by MANF overexpression in hemo-
cytes (Fig. 1F, black dots) and was recapitulated
by hemocyte-specific knockdown of MANF (Fig.
1E, right, and fig. S2C, right).
MANF has immune modulatory
properties that are required for retinal
repair in Drosophila
The protective effect of hemocyte-derived MANF
could be caused by direct neuroprotective activity

direct effect of MANF on the microenvironment
of the damaged retina. To distinguish between
these possibilities, we investigated whether MANF
could influence hemocyte phenotypes. Hemocytes
can acquire lamellocyte phenotypes, character-
ized by down-regulation of plasmatocyte markers
(hemolectin and hemese) and expression of Atilla
protein (37), during sterile wound healing (38).
These phenotypes correlate with hemocyte acti-
vation and may influence tissue repair capabilities,
and we recapitulated them in our UV damage
paradigm (Fig. 2A). Overexpression of MANF
in hemocytes in vivo or treatment of hemo-
cytes in culture with human recombinant MANF
(hrMANF) significantly increased the proportion
of lamellocytes in hemocyte smears, as detected
by Atilla expression (Fig. 2A). This correlated

 with a decrease in the proportion of cells express-
ing GFP driven by HmlD:Gal4 and a decrease
in hml transcripts (fig. S3A). Furthermore, MANF
was necessary and sufficient to induce the
Drosophila homolog of the mammalian M2 marker
arginase1 (arg) (39) in hemocytes (Fig. 2B and fig.
S3B), suggesting that these cells may be able to
acquire phenotypes similar to alternative activa-
tion (16, 17). Most MANF-expressing hemocytes
also expressed Arg, suggesting that there is an
association between MANF expression and M2-
like activation of hemocytes.
To determine whether MANF’s immune mod-
ulatory function is required for retinal repair, we
assessed retinal tissue preservation in conditions
in which hemocytes express and secrete high
levels of MANF but are unable to be activated
in response to this signal. We generated such a
condition by overexpressing MANF in the ab-
sence of Kdel receptors (KdelRs). In human cells,
KdelRs modulate MANF secretion and cell sur-
face binding. Intracellular KdelR prevents MANF
secretion, whereas cell-surface-bound KdelR
promotes binding of extracellular MANF (40).
Knockdown of the one Drosophila KdelR homo-
log (41) in hemocytes resulted in a significant
induction of MANF transcripts and the detec-
tion of MANF protein in the hemolymph (fig.
S3, C and D), suggesting that KdelR-depleted he-
mocytes secrete high levels of MANF. In these
hemocytes, MANF-induced lamellocyte forma-
tion and Arg expression were significantly de-
creased (Fig. 2, C and D). Hemocyte activation
by extracellular MANF is thus impaired after
KdelR knockdown. This genetic perturbation
also resulted in a significant enhancement of UV-
induced tissue loss, which could not be rescued
by MANF overexpression (Fig. 2E). Thus, immune
modulation by MANF is critical for tissue repair.
Damage response–associated
PDGF-A/MANF paracrine signaling is
conserved in mammals
MANF is an evolutionarily conserved protein (31),
and we sought to explore its regulation and its
potential to allay retinal degeneration and im-
prove retinal repair in vertebrates. We used focal
exposure of the central retina of C57BL/6 mice to
8000 lux of bright light for 1.5 hours to induce a
retinal innate immune response without general-
ized photoreceptor apoptosis [C57BL/6 mice carry
a protective variant of the Rpe65 gene, preventing
excessive retinal damage in response to light (42)].
This protocol resulted in a moderate and tran-
sient increase in the presence of innate immune
cells in the retina (Fig. 3 and fig. S4, A and B).
PDGF-family and VEGF-family proteins are
the mammalian homologs of Drosophila Pvf-
type ligands (43, 44), and we detected PDGF-
A–expressing cells in the neural retina 6 hours
after light exposure (Fig. 3B). The induction of
PDGF-A was followed by a significant increase
in MANF transcripts (Fig. 3C) and the detection
of MANF+ innate immune cells, identified by
CD11b expression (45, 46), in the vitreous (Fig. 3D
and fig. S4A, 12 hours). Resting microglia, local-
ized to the plexiform layers [inner plexiform layer
(IPL) and outer plexiform layer (OPL)] in control
retinas, did not express MANF (Fig. 3D, no light
exposure). Thirty-six hours later, MANF+ innate
immune cells were found within the outer nu-
clear layer (ONL) (Fig. 3D and fig. S4A, 36 hours).
This innate immune cell activation and/or recruit-
ment was also accompanied by a redistribution
of MANF protein from the cell bodies of Müller
glia [where it is detected in control conditions in
the inner nuclear layer (INL)] to glial processes
(identified by staining against glial fibrillary acid-
icprotein)(fig. S4C).Microglia and/ormacrophages
recruited and/or activated after light exposure
expressed reduced levels of MANF when PDGF
signaling was inhibited using neutralizing anti-
bodies against PDGFRa (47) (fig. S4, D and E).

 MANF expression in bone marrow–derived mac-

Damage signals from retinal cells thus engage
a conserved retinal repair response in both flies
and mice that involves the Pvf/PDGF-mediated
recruitment/activation of MANF-expressing in-

excessive apoptosis in response to light.
MANF has a conserved neuroprotective

To determine whether MANF protein supple-

light-induced retinal damage (42). This phenotype

 of these mice to 5000 lux of bright light for 1 hour
resulted in photoreceptor apoptosis (fig. S4G).
In addition, we used two genetic models of reti-
nal degeneration (Crxtvrm65, a slow model of
genetically induced retinal degeneration, and
Pde6bRd1, a fast model of genetically induced
retinal degeneration), whose dynamics of photo-
receptor loss have been previously described
(50–52).
We injected hrMANF protein or vehicle
[phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)] into the vit-
reous immediately before light exposure or at
the onset of retinal degeneration [postnatal day
14 (P14) for Crxtvrm65 mice and P7 for Pde6bRd1
mice] and evaluated photoreceptor apoptosis by
TUNEL. MANF injection significantly reduced
apoptosis in all three models of retinal degen-
eration (Fig. 3I and fig. S5, A and B). As photo-
receptors degenerate, the number of nuclei in
the ONL is reduced, and in Crxtvrm65 mice there
are on average five to six rows left at P21. In
hrMANF-treated eyes, there was a significant pre-
servation of photoreceptors in the ONL (fig. S5C),
suggesting that inhibition of apoptosis effectively
slows retinal degeneration in this model. Similar
results were observed in the Pde6bRd1 mouse mod-
el analyzed 5 days after intravitreal delivery of
hrMANF (fig. S5, D and E).
Finally, we asked whether a persistent source of
MANF could further delay retinal degeneration in
Crxtvrm65mice. Weinfectedhumanfibroblasts (hfib)
with a lentivirus driving the expression of a func-
tional MANF-GFP fusion protein (40). MANF-GFP
expression could readily be detected in these fi-
broblasts and in the media supernatant, confirm-
ing that the fusion protein was efficiently secreted
(fig. S5, F and G). When MANF-secreting fibroblasts
were injected into the vitreous of P14 Crxtvrm65
mice, their retinas degenerated more slowly than
control fibroblast-injected retinas, and a signifi-
cant amount of photoreceptors were preserved in
the ONL (Fig. 3J). Survival of injected fibroblasts
was confirmed at the time of analysis (2 weeks
after injection) by detecting the presence of GFP-
expressing cellular aggregates within the vitreous.
MANF can thus prevent photoreceptor apo-
ptosis broadly and delay retinal degeneration,
independently of the damaging stimulus.
MANF-dependent modulation of
immune cell phenotypes mediates
retinal protection
After intravitreal injection of MANF-secreting
fibroblasts, MANF+ innate immune cells (CD11b+)
could be detected in the vitreous of Crxtvrm65
mice (Fig. 4A, top panel). These CD11b+ cells with
round morphology also expressed markers of al-
ternative activation (16, 17) (Fig. 4A, bottom panel,
and Fig. 4B, left; fibroblasts injected into the
vitreous were detected by GFP expression at
the time of dissection and were completely re-
moved along with the lens). Intravitreal delivery
of hrMANF had similar effects on innate im-
mune cell phenotypes in Crxtvrm65 (Fig. 4B, right)
and light-damaged retinas (Fig. 4C and fig. S6A),
supporting an immune modulatory function for
MANF. Accordingly, the recruitment of MANF+
innate immune cells in response to PDGF-AA
treatment (Fig. 3, E and F) was accompanied by
a significant increase in the number of CD11b+
cells colabeled with Ym1+ (Fig. 4D and fig. S6B).
The innate immune cell population recruited
after MANF delivery was mostly composed of
monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages
(60 to 80%, identified by F4/80 or CD68 expres-
sion). Ly6-G+ (Gr-1high) neutrophils represented
about 15% of the population. The majority of
both macrophages and neutrophils (80%) ex-
pressed MANF and Arg1, suggesting that MANF
expression is associated with markers of alter-
native activation (fig. S6C), similar to what we
observed in fly hemocytes (fig. S3B).
In vitro stimulation with hrMANF for 3 hours
was also sufficient to induce markers of alterna-
tive activation (Arg1 and Ym1) (16, 17) and Il-13,
an anti-inflammatory cytokine (53), in BMDMs
(Fig. 4E) and in a macrophage cell line [RAW264.7
(54)] (fig. S7, A and B). Silencing of MANF with
a targeting small interfering RNA (siRNA) pool
in this cell line resulted in the repression of the
same set of genes (Fig. 4F). This suggests that
MANF has a direct immune modulatory func-
tion in macrophages and that at least part of
the mechanism is autocrine.
To determine whether immune modulation
by MANF is required for its neuroprotective ac-
tivity, we assessed retinal damage after light ex-
posure and after MANF supplementation in mice
with impaired immune cell function. We depleted
macrophages and microglia using diphtheria
toxin (DT) administration in CD11b:DTR mice
(55, 56). DT, but not sham (PBS), injection re-
sulted in a significant reduction in the number of
innate immune cells in the retina (fig. S7C) and
induction of photoreceptor apoptosis in response
to light exposure (Fig. 4G). Intravitreal supplemen-
tation of hrMANF protein did not significantly
reduce photoreceptor apoptosis in these mice
(Fig. 4G), supporting an essential role for im-
mune cells in mediating the protective effects
of MANF.
We further used mice deficient in Cx3Cr1 (57, 58)
to test the requirement of immune modulation
for the protective effects of MANF. Here, we
aimed at generating a condition in which im-
mune cells were present but failed to induce
alternative activation in response to MANF sig-
naling, similar to KdelR deficiency in flies. Cx3Cr1
is a chemokine receptor expressed in different
immune cell populations, including retinal mi-
croglia and peripheral monocytes (58). High
Cx3Cr1 expression has been associated with a
functionally distinct class of monocytes with
immune patrolling activity and with a molec-
ular profile of macrophage differentiation re-
sembling alternative activation (18, 19). Loss of

 Cx3Cr1 results in retinal degeneration in re-
sponse to several stimuli and is associated with
proinflammatory activation of immune cells
(9, 14, 59). Thus, we hypothesized that loss of
Cx3Cr1 could be an effective way to impair MANF-
induced alternative activation. Indeed, BMDMs
derived from Cx3Cr1-deficient mice failed to in-
duce genes associated with alternative activation
upon MANF stimulation (Fig. 4H), despite ex-
pressing normal levels of MANF (fig. S7, D and
E). Light-induced photoreceptor apoptosis in
Cx3Cr1-deficient mice could not be rescued by
intravitreal delivery of hrMANF (Fig. 4I), sug-
gesting that it is not only MANF derived from
macrophages that mediates the protective ef-
fects but rather a more complex mechanism
that depends on MANF immune modulatory ac-
tivity. We cannot exclude, however, that Cx3Cr1
deficiency may also result in other alterations
that contribute to the loss of protective effects of
MANF observed in these conditions, which may
be independent of macrophage functions.
MANF promotes cell integration and
restoration of visual function in the
mammalian retina
Retinal repair by transplantation of mouse and
human photoreceptor precursors can restore
vision in mouse models of retinal degeneration
(60, 61). Integration efficiency depends on the
ontogenetic stage of donor cells (60) and on the
status of the degenerative microenvironment
(62) and negatively correlates with the presence
of classically activated macrophages within the
retinal tissue (63). We injected photoreceptors
derived from Nrl-GFP mice subretinally into wild-
type retinas and found that microglia and/or
macrophages located at sites of integration ex-
pressed MANF, suggesting a possible role for
MANF-mediated immune modulation in pro-
moting integration (Fig. 5, A to C). Supporting
this hypothesis, integration efficiency was sig-
nificantly reduced in Cx3Cr1 mice (Fig. 5D).
To further test this hypothesis, we asked
whether MANF supplementation would in-
crease integration of subretinal-delivered photo-
receptors derived from Nrl-GFP mice into a
wild-type host. Integration efficiency declines
with increased maturity of injected photoreceptors
(60, 64). Accordingly, we observed a strong de-
cline in integration efficiency (assessed 1 week
after injection) when using P21 rather than P7 or
P14 photoreceptors in a wild-type host (Fig. 5E).
hrMANF supplementation rescues this decline
while having no effect on P14 cells (Fig. 5E and
fig. S8A), suggesting that MANF may act either
directly on refractory photoreceptors to improve
their integration capabilities or indirectly by
inducing a more supportive environment for
such cells.
To distinguish between these possibilities,
we tested the effects of MANF on integration
efficiency in degenerating retinas. The inflam-
matory microenvironment in degenerating reti-
nas is a likely cause for poor integration efficiency
(62) and thus a critical limitation in clinical
settings. We used Crxtvrm65 retinas to model a
degenerating environment and found that in-
tegration of even young (P7) Nrl-GFP photorecep-
tors, which efficiently integrated into wild-type
retinas (Fig. 5E), was significantly reduced in
Crxtvrm65 retinas (Fig. 5F). MANF supplementa-
tion significantly improved integration in this
context (Fig. 5F), supporting the notion that
MANF improves the environment for integra-
tion even in a disease context.
Importantly, MANF accelerated and improved
restoration of visual function, as evaluated by
maximal b-wave amplitudes measured in se-
quential electroretinogram (ERG) testing over
the course of 4 weeks (Fig. 5, G and H). Eyes
that received MANF-supplemented transplants
showed signs of light responsiveness based on a
detectable b-wave as early as 1 week after trans-
plantation, whereas eyes that received control
transplants had the earliest detectable b-wave
only at 3 weeks. Comparing ERG b-wave ampli-
tudes of untreated Crxtvrm65 mice (no transplant)
to treated mice at 1 to 4 weeks confirmed a
functional improvement in vision in the MANF-
supplemented cohort only, whereas the PBS-
supplemented group did not significantly differ
from untreated controls. The ERG changes re-
flected cell integration and not an effect of MANF
supplementation alone (fig. S8B) and represented
a recovery of about 60% of visual function when
compared with normal ERG b-wave amplitudes
of wild-type mice (Fig. 5H and fig. S8C). This is a
significant improvement over nonsupplemented
transplants, which yield about 20% of visual func-
tion recovery (Fig. 5H and fig. S8C) [see also (61)].
Discussion
Our results identify MANF as an evolutionarily
conserved immune modulator that plays a crit-
ical role in the regulatory network mediating
tissue repair in the retina (Fig. 6A). The ability
of MANF to increase regenerative success in
the mouse retina highlights the promise of mod-
ulating the immune environment as a strategy
to improve regenerative therapies (Fig. 6B).
The usefulness of immune modulation for
regenerative medicine has been anticipated
based on studies of tissues where regeneration
is sustained endogenously by resident stem cells
(3, 11, 65–69). Our study provides strong support
for this hypothesis.
MANF has previously been described as a neu-
rotrophic factor (30, 70, 71), and it may also exert
a direct neuroprotective effect in the retina, yet
our data suggest a more expansive role: Because
MANF cannot promote tissue repair in flies in
which the hemocyte response to MANF is se-
lectively ablated, or in mammalian retinas de-
pleted of innate immune cells or containing
macrophages that are unresponsive to MANF,
we propose that MANF’s role in promoting al-
ternative activation of innate immune cells is
central to its function in tissue repair. Further
studies will be required to determine the spe-
cific contribution of alternative-activated mac-
rophages in mediating these effects. Although
our data point to an important role of macro-
phages in mediating the effects, it does not ex-
clude the possibility that other cell types are
involved in the process or that macrophages’
functions other than polarization may influence
the outcome of MANF’s protective effects.
Clinically, MANF may thus have a distinct ad-
vantage over previously described neurotrophic
factors both in improving survival of transplanted
cells directlyandinpromotingamicroenvironment
supportive of local repair and integration. Be-
cause integration efficiency correlates with the
extent of vision restoration (61), it can be antic-
ipated that MANF supplementation will have
an important effect in clinical settings.
Further studies involving tissue-specific knock-
down of MANF in mammals will be required to
evaluate the relative contribution of different
cellular and tissue sources for MANF in homeo-
static and damage conditions. Although we found
that MANF is strongly expressed in immune cells,
we also observed MANF expression in other cell
types, in agreement with previous reports (72).
Similarly, the molecular mechanism involved
in MANF signaling remains elusive. To date, a
signal-transducing receptor for MANF has not
been identified, although protein kinase C sig-
naling has been described to be activated down-
stream of MANF (73). MANF can further negatively
regulate nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) signaling in
mammalian cells (74), and loss of MANF in
Drosophila results in the infiltration of pupal
brains with cells resembling hemocytes with
high Rel/NF-kB activity, potentially representing
proinflammatory, M1-like phenotypes (75). The
identification of immune cells as a target for
MANF in our study may accelerate the discovery
of putative MANF receptors and downstream
signaling pathways.
Because neurotoxic inflammation has been
implicated in Parkinson’s disease (76), it is pos-
sible that the protective effects of MANF in this
context (71) are also mediated by immune mod-
ulation, as we show here for retinal disease.
Indeed, recent reports suggest that the MANF
paralog, cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor,
has an anti-inflammatory function in murine
models of Parkinson’s disease (77) and in nerve
regeneration after spinal cord injury (78). A re-
cent study has further shown that loss of MANF
leads to beta cell loss in the pancreas (48). Beta
cell loss is commonly associated with chronic
inflammation, and it is thus tempting to specu-
late that MANF is broadly required in various
contexts to aid conversion of proinflammatory
macrophages into prorepair anti-inflammatory
macrophages. Future studies will clarify the role of
MANF in resolving inflammation and promoting
tissue repair not only in the retina and brain but
also in other tissues. A deeper understanding of
MANF-mediated immune modulation and its ef-
fect on stem cell function, wound repair, and tissue
maintenance is thus expected to help in the devel-
opment of effective regenerative therapies.

 Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care Inter-
national accredited vivarium of the Buck Institute
for Research on Aging, in a specific-pathogen-free
facility, inindividually ventilatedcagesonastandard
12:12 light cycle. All procedures were approved by
the Buck Institute Institutional Animal Care and
UseCommittee.Fordetailsonthemousestrainsand
lines used, see the supplementary materials (SM).
Drosophila stocks and culture
Fly stocks were raised on standard cornmeal-
and molasses-based food. All experiments were
performed at 25°C. Both sexes gave the same
results in all experiments, unless otherwise de-
scribed. For details on the fly lines used, see SM.
Intraocular injections in mice
For intravitreal injection, recombinant proteins
or cells in 1-ml volume were injected into the right
eye using a graduated pulled glass pipet and a wire
plunger (Wiretrol II, 5-0000-2005, Drummond
Scientific Company). For details on the test arti-
cles injected and the procedure for intravitreal
injections, see SM.
For subretinal injection, dissociated GFP-
expressing mouse retinal cells from the Nrl-GFP
mice were transplanted into the subretinal space
of recipient mice using the transcorneal sub-
retinal injection method. For details on the
preparation of Nrl-GFP cells and the procedure
for transplantation, see SM.
Light damage in mice
Mice were dark-adapted for 18 hours before the
procedure. Test eyes were exposed to 5000 to
20,000 lux of bright light using a 144 light-
emitting diode microscope ring light (AmScope)
for 1 to 2 hours. After light damage, mice were
allowed to recover from anesthesia, returned to
their cages, and housed in darkness until analysis.
Undamaged control mice were housed in regular
conditions throughout the experiment. For de-
tails, see SM.
UV damage in Drosophila pupae retina
and larvae
Pupae retinas were exposed to 17.5 mJ of UV
light as previously described (26, 28). Second-
instar larvae were exposed to 50 mJ of UV
light as previously described (25). For details
on the procedures and quantification methods,
see SM.
Histological analysis, imaging, and
quantification methods
Retinal sections, macrophages, and hemocyte
smears were analyzed by immunohistochemistry
(IHC) and other histological methods (see SM for
details) and imaged using a LSM 700 confocal
laser-scanning microscope; images were used for
quantification purposes. For details on staining
methods and quantification methods, see SM.
Electroretinogram
All ERGs were carried out under scotopic con-
ditions using a handheld multispecies electro-
retinograph (HMsERG, OcuScience) and analyzed
using ERGVIEW Version 4.3 (OcuScience). For
details on the procedures, see SM.
Cell culture
Raw 264.7 macrophages (ATCC, TIB-71, lot
61524889) and BMDMs were used in hrMANF
stimulation experiments and MANF knockdown
experiments. BMDMs were differentiated in cul-
ture from bone marrow using 20 ng/ml of mac-
rophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF, Sigma,
M9170) for 7 days. Raw 264.7 and BMDMs were
stimulated for 3 hours with 10 mg/ml of hrMANF
before analysis. For details on the procedures
and on the knockdown experiments, see SM.
Expression analyses
RNA sequencing and RT-qPCR were used to
quantify mRNA levels, and Western blot analysis
was used to quantify protein levels. For details
on the methods employed in each technique,
see SM.
Statistical analysis
All counts are presented as average and stan-
dard error of mean (SEM). Statistical analysis was
carried out using Microsoft Excel or GraphPad
Prism, and Student’s t test or two-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was used to determine statis-
tical significance, assuming normal distribution
and equal variance.
