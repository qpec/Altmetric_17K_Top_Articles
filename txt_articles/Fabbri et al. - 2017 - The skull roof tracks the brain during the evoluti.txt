Major transformations  in  brain  size  and  proportions,  such as  the  enlargement  of  the  brain  
25 
during  the  evolution  of  birds,  are accompanied  by  profound  modifications  to  the  skull  roof.  
26 
However,  the  hypothesis  of  concerted  evolution  of shape between brain  and  skull  roof  over  
27 
major  phylogenetic  transitions,  and in particular  of  an ontogenetic  relationship  between specific  
28 
regions  of  the  brain  and the  skull  roof,  has  never  been  formally  tested.  We  performed  3D  
29 
  
2 
 
morphometric  analyses  to  examine  the  deep  history  of  brain  and  skull-roof  morphology  in  
30 
Reptilia,  focusing  on  changes  during  the  well-documented  transition  from  early  reptiles  through 
31 
archosauromorphs including nonavian  dinosaurs  to  birds.  Non-avialan  taxa  cluster  tightly  
32 
together  in  morphospace,  whereas  Archaeopteryx  and  crown  birds occupy  a  separate  region.  
33 
There  is  a  one-to-one  correspondence  between  the  forebrain  and  frontal  and  the  midbrain  and  
34 
parietal.  Furthermore,  the  position  of  the  forebrain–midbrain  boundary  correlates  significantly  
35 
with  the position  of  the  frontoparietal  suture  in across  the  phylogenetic  breadth  of  Reptilia  and  
36 
during  the  ontogeny  of  individual  taxa.  Conservation of position and identity in the skull roof is 
37 
apparent, and there is no support  for  prior  hypotheses  that  the  avian  parietal  is  a  transformed  
38 
postparietal.  The  correlation  and apparent  developmental  link  between  regions  of  the  brain  and  
39 
bony  skull  elements  are  likely  ancestral  to  Tetrapoda  and  may  be  fundamental  to  all  of  
40 
Osteichthyes,  coeval  with  the  origin  of  the dermatocranium.

Introduction 
43 
The 
 
brain 
is 
often 
considered 
to 
have 
 
a 
 
peculiar 
 
primacy 
 
in 
 
the 
 
development 
 
of 
 
the 
 
heade.g.1-
4. 
 
A 
 
44 
general 
 
developmental 
 
relationship 
 
between 
 
brain 
 
and 
 
skull, 
 
with 
 
an 
 
emphasis 
 
on 
 
the 
 
facial 
 
region, 
 
45 
has 
 
been 
 
well 
 
documented 
 
across 
 
tetrapods1-
12 
– 
however, 
 
associations 
 
between 
 
particular 
 
regions 
 
of 
 
46 
the 
 
brain 
 
and 
 
the 
 
primordia 
 
of 
 
individual 
 
elements 
 
of 
 
the 
 
skull 
 
roof 
 
have 
 
not 
 
been 
 
shown, 
 
despite 
 
47 
the 
 
fact 
 
that 
 
these 
 
associations 
 
speak 
 
to 
 
both 
 
the 
 
patterning 
 
and 
 
the 
 
identity 
 
of 
the 
bones 
of 
the 
head. 
 
48 
The 
 
skull 
 
roof 
 
or 
 
cranial 
 
vault 
 
directly 
 
overlies 
 
the 
 
brain; 
 
its 
 
largest 
 
constituents 
 
are 
 
the 
 
frontal 
 
49 
bone 
 
anteriorly, 
 
between 
 
the 
 
orbits, 
 
and 
 
the 
 
parietal 
 
bone 
 
posteriorly, 
 
between 
 
the 
 
adductor 
 
muscle 
 
50 
chambers. 
 
The 
 
homologies 
 
of 
 
these 
 
bones 
 
are 
 
a 
 
subject 
 
of 
 
recent 
 
contention 
 
based 
 
on 
 
developmental 
 
51 
evidence, 
 
especially 
 
along 
 
the 
 
transition 
 
from 
 
small-
brained 
 
nonavian 
 
reptile 
 
ancestors 
 
to 
 
large-
52 
brained 
 
birds 
 
(Aves)13-
15. 
 
Early 
 
studies 
 
concluded 
 
that 
 
the 
 
entire 
 
frontal 
 
in 
 
chicken 
 
was 
 
53 
developmentally 
 
derived 
 
from 
 
cells 
 
of 
 
the 
 
neural 
 
creste.g. 
 
16, 
 
as 
 
is 
 
the 
 
case 
 
in 
 
mouse 
 
and 
 
axolotl5-
6,17, 
 
54 
whereas 
 
later 
 
works 
 
suggested 
 
a 
 
composite 
 
germ-
layer 
 
origin, 
 
with 
 
cranial 
 
neural 
 
crest 
 
contributing 
 
55 
to 
 
the 
 
anterior 
 
part 
 
of 
 
the 
 
frontal 
 
and 
 
mesoderm 
 
to 
 
the 
 
posterior17-
18. 
 
The 
 
latter 
 
interpretation 
 
56 
inspired 
 
a 
 
hypothesis 
 
that 
 
the 
 
avian 
 
frontal 
 
actually 
 
represents 
 
a 
 
fusion 
 
of 
 
the 
 
frontal 
 
and 
 
parietal 
 
57 
  
3 
 
bones 
 
of 
 
other 
 
reptiles, 
 
and 
 
that 
 
the 
 
avian 
 
parietal 
 
is 
 
in 
 
fact 
 
the 
 
postparietal 
 
or 
 
interparietal, 
 
an 
 
58 
ossification 
 
or 
 
pair 
 
of 
 
ossifications 
 
seen 
 
in 
 
primitive 
 
Amniota18. 
 
This 
 
brings 
 
into 
 
question 
 
the 
 
59 
identity, 
 
homology 
 
(defined 
 
as 
 
homology=synapomorphy 
 
for 
 
this 
 
study, 
 
or 
 
secondary 
 
homology 
 
sensu 
 
60 
De 
 
Pinna19), 
 
and 
 
nomenclature 
 
of 
 
the 
 
skull 
 
elements 
 
in 
 
Aves 
 
relative 
 
to 
 
its 
 
successive 
 
sister 
 
taxa. 
 
 
61 
We 
 
qualitatively 
 
and 
 
quantitatively 
 
examined 
 
the 
 
relationship 
 
of 
 
the 
 
brain 
 
to 
 
the 
 
skull 
 
roof 
 
from 
 
a 
 
62 
combined 
 
phylogenetic 
 
and 
 
ontogenetic 
 
perspective. 
 
We 
 
wished 
 
in 
 
particular 
 
to 
 
trace 
 
the 
 
evolution 
 
63 
of 
 
brain 
 
and 
 
skull 
 
roof 
 
through 
 
the 
 
entire 
 
history 
 
of 
 
Archosauromorpha 
 
and 
 
to 
 
resolve 
 
the 
 
64 
conundrum 
 
concerning 
 
the 
 
identity 
 
and 
 
homology 
 
of 
 
skull-
roof 
 
elements 
 
in 
 
crown 
 
birds. 
 
Contrary 
 
to 
 
65 
previous 
 
studies17, 
 
we 
 
found 
 
no 
 
support 
 
for 
 
a 
 
fused 
 
origin 
 
of 
 
the 
 
avian 
 
frontal  and 
 
a 
 
resulting 
 
shift 
 
66 
in 
 
skull-
roof 
 
element 
 
identity 
 
in 
 
birds. 
 
Our 
 
data 
 
instead 
 
suggest 
 
that 
 
the 
 
dominant 
 
developmental 
 
67 
influence 
 
on 
 
the 
 
identity 
 
of 
 
individual 
 
skull-
roof 
 
elements 
 
is 
 
the 
 
organization 
 
of 
 
the 
 
brain 
 
at 
 
its 
 
68 
three-
vesicle 
 
stage, 
 
and 
 
that 
 
a 
 
strict 
 
correlation 
 
between 
 
regions 
 
of 
 
the 
 
brain 
 
and 
 
particular 
 
skull-
roof 
 
69 
elements, 
 
specifically 
 
between 
 
the 
 
forebrain 
 
(derived 
 
from 
 
the 
 
embryonic 
 
prosencephalon) 
 
and 
 
the 
 
70 
frontal 
 
and 
 
the 
 
midbrain 
 
(derived 
 
from 
 
the 
 
embryonic 
 
mesencephalon) 
 
and 
 
the 
 
parietal, 
 
is 
 
present 
 
at 
 
71 
least 
 
across 
 
all 
 
amniotes. 
 
Morphological 
 
correlation 
 
of 
 
course 
 
is 
 
not 
 
sufficient 
 
to 
 
demonstrate 
 
72 
developmental 
 
mechanism, 
 
and 
 
we 
 
hope 
 
that 
 
our 
 
findings 
 
inspire 
 
evolutionarily 
 
informed 
 
searches 
 
73 
for 
 
the 
 
molecular 
 
patterning 
 
responsible 
 
for 
 
correspondences 
 
between 
 
early 
 
embryonic 
 
structures 
 
and 
 
74 
the 
 
later-
appearing 
 
ossified 
 
skeleton. 
 
 
 
 
75 
To 
 
test 
 
the 
 
hypothesis 
 
that 
 
there 
 
is 
 
a 
 
close 
 
relationship 
 
between 
 
brain 
 
and 
 
skull 
 
roof, 
 
we 
 
used 
 
3D 
 
76 
geometric 
 
morphometrics 
 
and 
 
comparative 
 
embryology 
 
to 
 
explore 
 
the 
 
association 
 
between 
 
these 
 
77 
structures 
 
along 
 
the 
 
entire 
 
stem 
 
and 
 
crown 
 
reptile 
 
lineage, 
 
including 
 
Lepidosauria 
 
(lizards, 
 
snakes, 
 
78 
and 
 
tuataras), 
 
Crocodylia, 
 
and 
 
Avialae, 
 
as 
 
well 
 
as 
 
stem-
group 
 
Crocodylia, 
 
stem-
group 
 
Archosauria, 
 
79 
and 
 
stem-
group 
 
reptiles 
 
(Fig. 
 
1a). 
 
This 
 
sample 
 
includes 
 
pivotal 
 
taxa 
 
whose 
 
endocranial 
 
spaces 
 
and 
 
80 
surrounding 
 
bones 
 
have 
 
never 
 
been 
 
examined 
 
(see 
 
Table 
S1 
 
for 
 
a 
 
list 
 
of 
 
taxa 
 
included 
 
in 
 
this 
 
81 
study)20-
21. 
 
Extant 
 
taxa 
 
included 
 
embryonic 
 
series 
 
for 
 
alligator 
 
(Alligator  mississippiensis) 
 
and 
 
chicken 
 
82 
(Gallus  gallus), 
 
which 
 
were 
 
stained 
 
to 
 
reveal 
 
soft 
 
tissues. 
 
When 
 
embryonic 
 
skull 
 
roofs 
 
were 
 
not 
 
83 
sufficiently 
 
ossified, 
 
we 
 
used 
 
contrast-
stained 
 
brains 
 
to 
 
extract 
 
brain 
 
shapes 
 
directly 
 
(see 
 
84 
supplemental 
 
material 
 
for 
 
general 
 
methods 
 
used 
 
and 
 
protocols 
 
in 
 
staining).

Results  and  Discussion 
86 
Our 
 
data 
 
revealed 
 
an 
 
overall 
 
conservation 
 
of 
 
skull-
roof 
 
architecture 
 
across 
 
Reptilia, 
 
as 
 
well 
 
as 
 
87 
conservation 
 
in 
 
the 
 
relationship 
 
between 
 
the 
 
skull 
 
roof 
 
and 
 
the 
 
brain. 
 
The 
 
adult 
 
frontal 
 
always 
 
lies 
 
88 
over 
 
the 
 
forebrain, 
 
whereas 
 
the 
 
adult 
 
parietal 
 
lies 
 
either 
 
over 
 
the 
 
midbrain 
 
or 
 
over 
 
a 
 
combination 
 
of 
 
89 
midbrain 
 
and 
 
posterior 
 
forebrain 
 
(Fig. 
 
1b-
d, 
 
Fig. 
 
2). 
 
The 
 
postparietal, 
 
when 
 
present 
 
in 
 
extinct 
 
90 
reptiles, 
 
is 
 
a 
 
diminutive 
 
dermal 
 
element 
 
that 
 
does 
 
not 
 
directly 
 
overlie 
 
the 
 
brain. 
 
It 
 
is 
 
generally 
 
91 
excluded 
 
from 
 
contacting 
 
the 
 
dura  mater 
 
by 
 
the 
 
parietals 
 
and 
 
supraoccipital 
 
(Fig. 
 
1b, 
 
Fig. 
 
2). 
 
Its 
 
92 
most 
 
consistent 
 
relationship 
 
is 
 
with 
 
the 
 
nuchal 
 
musculature, 
 
which 
 
can 
 
be 
 
reconstructed 
 
to 
 
have 
 
93 
attached 
 
broadly 
 
to 
 
its 
 
posterior 
 
surface 
 
(Fig. 
 
1b). 
 
 
94 
The 
 
postparietal 
 
is 
 
lost 
 
in 
 
Lepidosauria22 
 
(Fig. 
 
1a, 
 
Fig. 
 
2). 
 
It 
 
is 
 
commonly 
 
present, 
 
with 
 
some 
 
95 
exceptions, 
 
along 
 
the 
 
archosaurian 
 
stem, 
 
and 
 
then 
 
almost 
 
completely 
 
disappears 
 
prior 
 
to 
 
the 
 
96 
divergence 
 
of 
 
Archosauria23. 
 
We 
 
confirmed, 
 
however, 
 
one 
 
case 
 
of 
 
reappearance 
 
of 
 
the 
 
postparietal 
 
97 
within 
 
the 
 
crocodile 
 
lineage: 
 
our 
 
CT 
 
scans 
 
of 
 
Gracilisuchus  stipanicorum  show 
 
clear 
 
sutures 
 
98 
between 
 
the 
 
parietals 
 
and 
 
the 
 
element 
 
posited 
 
to 
 
be 
 
a 
 
secondarily 
 
acquired 
 
postparietal24  (Fig. 
 
1a-
b, 
 
99 
Fig. 
 
2). 
 
Previous 
 
work 
 
has 
 
questioned 
 
the 
 
identity 
 
of 
 
the 
 
element 
 
and 
 
its 
 
distinction 
 
from 
 
the 
 
100 
parietal23. 
 
The 
 
reacquired 
 
postparietal 
 
of 
 
G.  stipanicorum 
 
is 
 
small 
 
and, 
 
as 
 
expected, 
 
does 
 
not 
 
border 
 
101 
the 
 
endocranial 
 
space. 
 
In 
 
all 
 
the 
 
postparietals 
 
present 
 
in 
 
the 
 
extinct 
 
reptiles 
 
we 
 
examined, 
 
we 
 
could 
 
102 
find 
 
neither 
 
anatomical 
 
nor 
 
topological 
 
points 
 
of 
 
similarity 
 
that 
 
could 
 
be 
 
used 
 
to 
 
suggest 
 
primary 
 
103 
homology 
 
with 
 
dinosaurian, 
 
including 
 
avian, 
 
parietals, 
 
though 
 
it 
 
is 
 
possible 
 
that 
 
in 
 
some 
 
cases 
 
the 
 
104 
small 
 
postparietal 
 
was 
 
absorbed 
 
by 
 
the 
 
parietals 
 
to 
 
form 
 
a 
 
minute 
 
posterior 
 
eminence. 
105 
Despite 
 
an 
 
overall 
 
conservation 
 
of

a

This 
 
clustering 
 
arises 
 
despite 
 
an 
 
evolutionary 
 
divergence 
 
of 
 
250 
 
million 
 
years, 
 
an

and

The

absence 
 
of 
 
a

not 
 
seem 
 
to 
 
influence 
 
the 
 
116

One 
 
of 
 
the

is 
 
composed 
 
of 
 
the

Allosaurus

Acrocanthosaurus. 
 
Their

be 
 
driven 
 
solely 
 
by 
 
118 
the 
 
depth 
 
of 
 
the

possibly 
 
for 
 
the 
 
attachment 
 
of

as 
 
the

of 
 
the 
 
other

(Fig.

121 
Archaeopteryx

from 
 
the 
 
more 
 
conservative

along

(Fig.

122 
Archaeopteryx 
 
is 
 
closer 
 
to 
 
crown 
 
birds 
 
than 
 
to 
 
non-

maniraptorans 
 
in

The 
 
inclusion 
 
of 
 
ontogenetic 
 
series 
 
for 
 
chicken 
 
and 
 
alligator 
 
revealed 
 
that, 
 
relative 
 
to 
 
alligator 
 
125 
ontogeny, 
 
chicken 
 
ontogeny 
 
is 
 
morphologically 
 
short. 
 
Brains 
 
and 
 
skull 
 
roofs 
 
of 
 
chicken 
 
embryos 
 
are 
 
126 
similar 
 
to 
 
those 
 
of 
 
adults, 
 
despite 
 
a 
 
sample 
 
that 
 
extends 
 
from 
 
early 
 
embryos 
 
to 
 
large 
 
adults. 
 
The 
 
127 
ontogenetic 
 
trajectory 
 
of 
 
alligator 
 
is 
 
longer, 
 
traversing 
 
a 
 
distance 
 
in 
 
morphospace 
 
equivalent 
 
to 
 
134% 
 
128 
that 
 
of 
 
chicken. 
 
Alligator 
 
embryos 
 
clustered 
 
with 
 
crown 
 
birds 
 
and 
 
Archaeopteryx 
 
in 
 
the 
 
combined 
 
129 
and 
 
skull-
roof 
 
analyses, 
 
whereas 
 
they 
 
fell 
 
within 
 
the 
 
cluster 
 
of 
 
more 
 
conservative 
 
taxa 
 
when 
 
we 
 
130 
included 
 
only 
 
the 
 
brain 
 
(Fig. 
 
3b-
c). 
 
We 
 
noted 
 
a 
 
negative 
 
allometry 
 
between 
 
the 
 
brain 
 
and 
 
skull 
 
131 
during 
 
the 
 
development 
 
of 
 
alligators: 
 
the 
 
brain 
 
is 
 
relatively 
 
large 
 
in 
 
the 
 
early 
 
stages 
 
of 
 
development 
 
132 
and 
 
becomes 
 
smaller 
 
with 
 
respect 
 
to 
 
the 
 
skull 
 
during 
 
growth. 
 
On 
 
the 
 
other 
 
hand, 
 
birds 
 
have 
 
a 
 
very 
 
133 
large 
 
brain 
 
at 
 
hatching 
 
relative 
 
to 
 
the 
 
skull, 
 
and 
 
the 
 
brain 
 
continues 
 
to 
 
expand 
 
during 
 
ontogeny, 
 
134 
growing 
 
with 
 
positive 
 
allometry. 
 
We 
 
suggest 
 
that 
 
the 
 
brain 
 
in 
 
Aves 
 
should 
 
be 
 
considered 
 
135 
peramorphic 
 
in 
 
recognition 
 
of 
 
earlier 
 
onset 
 
of 
 
growth, 
 
faster 
 
sustained 
 
growth, 
 
and 
 
absolutely 
 
larger 
 
136 
adult 
 
size 
 
in 
 
comparison 
 
with 
 
all 
 
but 
 
the 
 
most 
 
crownward 
 
non-
avian 
 
avialans. 
137 
Given 
 
the 
 
generally 
 
consistent 
 
clustering 
 
of 
 
taxa 
 
on 
 
the 
 
brain 
 
and 
 
skull-
roof 
 
morphometric 
 
plots, 
 
we 
 
138 
expected 
 
to 
 
find 
 
a 
 
correspondence 
 
between 
 
regions 
 
of 
 
the 
 
brain 
 
and 
 
bony 
 
elements 
 
of 
 
the 
 
skull 
 
139 
roof. 
 
First, 
 
we 
 
tested 
 
and 
 
failed 
 
to 
 
reject 
 
the 
 
hypothesis 
 
of 
 
integration 
 
(similar 
 
levels 
 
of 
 
covariation 
 
140 
for 
 
morphological 
 
traits 
 
between 
 
and 
 
within 
 
modules) 
 
between 
 
the 
 
skull 
 
roof 
 
and 
 
brain 
 
across 
 
the 
 
141 
  
6 
 
evolutionary 
 
history 
 
of 
 
reptiles 
 
(CR 
 
= 
 
0.982, 
 
P 
 
= 
 
0. 
 
092), 
 
a 
 
finding 
 
contrary 
 
to 
 
previous 
 
studiese.g. 
 
142 
3. 
 
This 
 
result 
 
reveals 
 
that, 
 
despite 
 
major 
 
morphological 
 
changes 
 
throughout 
 
the 
 
evolutionary 
 
history 
 
143 
of 
 
the 
 
major 
 
reptile 
 
lineages, 
 
the 
 
general 
 
morphologies 
 
of 
 
the 
 
skull 
 
roof 
 
and 
 
brain 
 
regions 
 
are 
 
144 
integrated 
 
across 
 
the 
 
entire 
 
clade. 
 
Second, 
 
as 
 
we 
 
wanted 
 
to 
 
test 
 
for 
 
a 
 
direct 
 
relationship 
 
between 
 
145 
frontal 
 
and 
 
forebrain 
 
and 
 
parietal 
 
and 
 
midbrain, 
 
we 
 
compared 
 
the 
 
anteroposterior 
 
positions 
 
of 
 
the 
 
146 
forebrain–midbrain 
 
boundary 
 
and 
 
the 
 
frontoparietal 
 
suture 
 
and 
 
demonstrated 
 
a 
 
significant 
 
correlation 
 
147 
between 
 
the 
 
two 
 
(P 
 
= 
 
0.014), 
 
but 
 
with 
 
an 
 
unexpected 
 
pattern 
 
(Fig. 
 
4, 
 
Table 
 
S2-
S3). 
 
The 
 
best-
fitting 
 
148 
linear 
 
regression 
 
model 
 
also 
 
included 
 
a 
 
categorical 
 
variable 
 
subdividing 
 
sampled 
 
taxa 
 
into 
 
two 
 
149 
groups 
 
(P 
 
= 
 
8.0-
5). 
 
The 
 
first 
 
group 
 
includes 
 
non-
archosaurian 
 
reptiles, 
 
stem 
 
reptiles, 
 
and 
 
non-
150 
coelurosaurian 
 
archosaurs. 
 
In 
 
this 
 
sample, 
 
some 
 
of 
 
the 
 
taxa 
 
have 
 
a 
 
frontoparietal 
 
contact 
 
positioned 
 
151 
anterior 
 
to 
 
the 
 
forebrain–midbrain 
 
boundary. 
 
The 
 
second 
 
group 
 
consists 
 
of 
 
coelurosaurian 
 
dinosaurs, 
 
152 
including 
 
tyrannosaurs 
 
and 
 
crown 
 
birds. 
 
In 
 
these 
 
taxa, 
 
the 
 
forebrain–midbrain 
 
boundary 
 
and 
 
the 
 
153 
overlying 
 
suture 
 
are 
 
nearly 
 
aligned 
 
(Fig. 
 
S4). 
 
Conspicuously, 
 
alligators 
 
shift 
 
from 
 
a 
 
bird-
like 
 
154 
configuration, 
 
with 
 
the 
 
brain 
 
and 
 
skull 
 
boundaries 
 
aligned, 
 
toward 
 
a 
 
non-
coelurosaurian 
 
configuration, 
 
155 
with 
 
an 
 
offset 
 
between 
 
the 
 
two, 
 
during 
 
their 
 
ontogeny. 
 
 
156 
Thus, 
 
in 
 
coelurosaurs, 
 
compared 
 
with 
 
their 
 
successive 
 
sister 
 
taxa, 
 
the 
 
adult 
 
frontoparietal 
 
suture 
 
157 
shifts 
 
posteriorly 
 
relative 
 
to 
 
brain 
 
compartmental 
 
boundaries 
 
in 
 
a 
 
paedomorphic 
 
retention 
 
of 
 
the 
 
158 
original 
 
embryonic 
 
relationship 
 
(Fig. 
 
1a, 
 
Fig. 
 
2, 
 
Fig. 
 
4, 
 
Fig. 
 
S4). 
 
We 
 
propose 
 
that 
 
the 
 
maintenance 
 
159 
of 
 
the 
 
posterior 
 
sutural 
 
position 
 
in 
 
adults 
 
is 
 
accompanied 
 
by 
 
the 
 
incorporation 
 
of 
 
additional 
 
and 
 
160 
more 
 
posteriorly 
 
located 
 
sources 
 
of 
 
skeletal 
 
precursor 
 
cells 
 
into 
 
the 
 
frontal, 
 
as 
 
suggested 
 
by 
 
cell-
161 
lineage 
 
labeling 
 
experiments 
 
in 
 
chicken 
 
embryos25. 
 
The 
 
exact 
 
germ-
layer 
 
origin 
 
of 
 
these 
 
cells 
 
is 
 
162 
unknown, 
 
but 
 
is 
 
most 
 
likely 
 
mesodermal, 
 
and 
 
may 
 
correspond 
 
to 
 
mesodermal 
 
precursors 
 
that 
 
163 
contribute 
 
to 
 
the 
 
parietal 
 
bone 
 
in 
 
non-
avian 
 
reptiles. 
 
We 
 
note, 
 
however, 
 
that 
 
if 
 
this 
 
is 
 
the 
 
case, 
 
164 
there 
 
was 
 
no 
 
intrinsic 
 
morphological 
 
information 
 
contained 
 
in 
 
these 
 
precursors: 
 
the 
 
back 
 
of 
 
the 
 
165 
crown-avian 
 
frontal 
 
does 
 
not 
 
begin 
 
to 
 
look 
 
like 
 
the 
 
front 
 
of 
 
the 
 
ancestral 
 
dinosaurian 
 
parietal 
 
during 
 
166 
the 
 
evolutionary 
 
transition. 
 
Instead, 
 
despite 
 
altered 
 
proportions, 
 
it 
 
flares 
 
outward 
 
and 
 
has 
 
the 
 
same 
 
167 
proportional 
 
shape 
 
and 
 
articulations 
 
as 
 
other 
 
reptilian 
 
frontals 
 
(Fig. 
 
1). 
 
The 
 
alternative 
 
explanation 
 
is 
 
168 
a 
 
novel 
 
contribution 
 
of 
 
more 
 
posteriorly 
 
located 
 
mesenchymal 
 
precursor 
 
cells, 
 
also 
 
resulting 
 
in 
 
a 
 
169 
  
7 
 
largely 
 
mesodermal 
 
but 
 
potentially 
 
mixed 
 
composition 
 
of 
 
the 
 
“new” 
 
posterior 
 
part 
 
of 
 
the 
 
avian 
 
170 
frontal. 
 
This 
 
configuration 
 
could 
 
explain 
 
the 
 
ongoing 
 
confusion 
 
and 
 
debate 
 
regarding 
 
the 
 
exact 
 
171 
developmental 
 
origin 
 
of 
 
this 
 
structure. 
 
Some 
 
studies 
 
still 
 
suggest 
 
that 
 
the 
 
entire 
 
avian 
 
frontal 
 
is 
 
172 
derived 
 
from 
 
neural 
 
crest 
 
cells, 
 
a 
 
migratory 
 
population 
 
of 
 
neuroectodermal 
 
derivation; 
 
other 
 
173 
experiments 
 
suggest 
 
a 
 
mesodermal 
 
contributione.g. 
 
17-
18, 
 
26. 
 
Germ-
layer 
 
origins 
 
have 
 
been 
 
used 
 
to 
 
argue 
 
174 
that 
 
the 
 
avian 
 
frontal 
 
must 
 
be 
 
a 
 
fused 
 
frontoparietal 
 
because 
 
it 
 
contains 
 
both 
 
neural 
 
crest– 
 
and 
 
175 
mesoderm-
derived 
 
cells, 
 
and 
 
that 
 
the 
 
avian 
 
parietal, 
 
generally 
 
accepted 
 
as 
 
being 
 
mesodermally 
 
176 
derived, 
 
is 
 
a 
 
postparietal. 
 
However, 
 
the 
 
central 
 
part 
 
of 
 
the 
 
interparietal 
 
of 
 
mammals, 
 
which 
 
is 
 
177 
homologous 
 
to 
 
the 
 
ancestral 
 
amniote 
 
postparietal, 
 
has 
 
been 
 
described 
 
as 
 
being 
 
derived 
 
from 
 
neural 
 
178 
crest5. 
 
This 
 
means 
 
that 
 
the 
 
avian 
 
frontoparietal 
 
hypothesis 
 
must 
 
invoke 
 
a 
 
shift 
 
in 
 
germ-
layer 
 
origins, 
 
179 
the 
 
avoidance 
 
of 
 
which 
 
was 
 
its 
 
core 
 
inspiration. 
 
Moreover, 
 
the 
 
germ-
layer 
 
origins 
 
of 
 
cranial 
 
roof 
 
180 
bones 
 
are 
 
more 
 
varied 
 
than 
 
previously 
 
reported. 
 
The 
 
parietal 
 
in 
 
mammals, 
 
for 
 
instance, 
 
is 
 
also 
 
181 
reported 
 
to 
 
be 
 
of 
 
dual 
 
origin, 
 
with 
 
its 
 
central 
 
part 
 
derived 
 
from 
 
neural 
 
crest 
 
and 
 
its 
 
more 
 
lateral 
 
182 
portions 
 
from 
 
mesoderm3,6,27. 
 
In 
 
amphibians, 
 
the 
 
parietal 
 
is 
 
reportedly 
 
either 
 
mesodermally 
 
derived 
 
183 
(in 
 
the 
 
axolotl) 
 
or 
 
of 
 
mixed 
 
neural 
 
crest–mesodermal 
 
origin 
 
(in 
 
the 
 
fused 
 
frontoparietal 
 
element 
 
of 
 
184 
Xenopus 
 
frogs)17,26. 
 
More 
 
notably 
 
still, 
 
the 
 
frontal 
 
of 
 
zebrafish, 
 
like 
 
that 
 
of 
 
chicken, 
 
is 
 
reported 
 
to 
 
185 
be 
 
of 
 
composite 
 
neural 
 
crest 
 
and 
 
mesodermal 
 
origin28. 
 
This 
 
raises 
 
the 
 
possibility 
 
that 
 
a 
 
composite 
 
186 
frontal 
 
is 
 
in 
 
fact 
 
the 
 
ancestral 
 
osteichthyan 
 
condition. 
 
Data 
 
from

especially 
 
from

as 
 
representatives 
 
of 
 
Crocodylia 
 
and 
 
Squamata, 
 
and 
 
from 
 
other 
 
non-
tetrapod 
 
vertebrates, 
 
188 
are 
 
needed 
 
to 
 
establish 
 
both 
 
the 
 
ancestral 
 
osteichthyan 
 
condition 
 
and 
 
the 
 
polarity 
 
of 
 
change.

The 
 
topology 
 
of 
 
all 
 
other 
 
structures 
 
in 
 
the 
 
avian 
 
head 
 
remains 
 
consistent 
 
with 
 
our 
 
conclusion 
 
that 
 
191 
the 
 
entire 
 
enlarged 
 
avian 
 
frontal 
 
bone 
 
is 
 
homologous 
 
to 
 
the 
 
smaller 
 
frontal 
 
in 
 
more 
 
conservative 
 
192 
groups, 
 
and 
 
that 
 
the 
 
constricted 
 
and 
 
rotated 
 
avian 
 
parietal 
 
is 
 
nonetheless 
 
homologous 
 
to 
 
the 
 
ancestral 
 
193 
reptilian 
 
parietal. 
 
The 
 
positional 
 
relations 
 
of 
 
these 
 
two 
 
elements 
 
to 
 
other 
 
cranial 
 
structures, 
 
skeletal 
 
194 
and 
 
non-
skeletal, 
 
are 
 
conserved, 
 
both 
 
in 
 
adulthood 
 
and 
 
during 
 
ontogeny 
 
(Fig. 
 
5). 
 
In 
 
particular, 
 
the 
 
195 
parietal 
 
is 
 
always 
 
broadly 
 
flanked 
 
by 
 
the 
 
squamosals 
 
and 
 
contacts 
 
the 
 
supraoccipital 
 
posteriorly 
 
(Fig. 
 
196 
5). 
 
The 
 
eyes 
 
remain 
 
encircled 
 
by 
 
the 
 
frontals 
 
despite 
 
the 
 
greater 
 
size 
 
of 
 
eyes 
 
in 
 
crown 
 
birds, 
 
and 
 
197 
  
8 
 
the 
 
pseudotemporalis 
 
or 
 
adductor 
 
internus 
 
group 
 
of 
 
the 
 
jaw 
 
muscles 
 
remains 
 
attached 
 
to 
 
the 
 
side 
 
of 
 
198 
the 
 
parietal, 
 
even 
 
as 
 
this 
 
bone 
 
becomes 
 
smaller 
 
and 
 
rotates 
 
to 
 
assume 
 
a 
 
more 
 
vertical 
 
orientation 
 
199 
(Fig. 
 
S5). 
 
The 
 
midbrain, 
 
including 
 
the 
 
optic 
 
lobes, 
 
remains 
 
subjacent 
 
to 
 
the 
 
parietal, 
 
though 
 
it 
 
is 
 
200 
shifted 
 
ventrally 
 
in 
 
crown 
 
birds. 
 
This 
 
conservation 
 
of 
 
topology 
 
stands 
 
in 
 
contrast 
 
to 
 
recent 
 
claims 
 
201 
that 
 
spatial 
 
relationships 
 
of 
 
the 
 
avian 
 
frontal 
 
and 
 
parietal 
 
are 
 
modified 
 
from 
 
the 
 
ancestral 
 
reptilian 
 
202 
condition19,26. 
 
Thus, 
 
in 
 
terms 
 
of 
 
adult 
 
anatomical 
 
homology, 
 
there 
 
is 
 
no 
 
evidence 
 
that 
 
the 
 
avian 
 
203 
frontal 
 
bone 
 
is 
 
a 
 
composite 
 
frontoparietal. 
 
Also, 
 
there 
 
is 
 
no 
 
evidence 
 
that 
 
the 
 
parietal 
 
is 
 
either 
 
a 
 
204 
“semiparietal” 
 
or 
 
a 
 
reacquired 
 
and 
 
radically 
 
transformed 
 
postparietal. 
 
A 
 
proposed 
 
novel 
 
contribution 
 
205 
to 
 
the 
 
posterior 
 
part 
 
of 
 
the 
 
avian 
 
frontal 
 
and 
 
a 
 
potential 
 
shift 
 
in 
 
germ-
layer 
 
contribution 
 
appear 
 
to 
 
206 
have 
 
occurred 
 
without 
 
violating 
 
the 
 
structural 
 
homology 
 
of 
 
the 
 
bone. 
 
 
207 
The 
 
ontogenetic 
 
shift 
 
in 
 
developing 
 
alligator 
 
from 
 
close 
 
alignment 
 
of 
 
the 
 
forebrain–midbrain 
 
208 
boundary 
 
and 
 
frontoparietal 
 
suture 
 
to 
 
a 
 
displacement 
 
of 
 
those 
 
structures 
 
suggests 
 
that 
 
a 
 
decoupling 
 
209 
between 
 
the 
 
brain 
 
and 
 
skull 
 
roof 
 
occurs 
 
later 
 
during 
 
development, 
 
following 
 
what 
 
we 
 
hypothesized 
 
210 
to 
 
be 
 
an 
 
early 
 
close 
 
association 
 
of 
 
the 
 
initial 
 
ossifications 
 
of 
 
the 
 
skull 
 
roof 
 
with 
 
the 
 
divisions 
 
of 
 
211 
the 
 
brain. 
 
This 
 
bone-
to-
brain 
 
relationship 
 
had 
 
not 
 
previously 
 
been 
 
examined 
 
in 
 
embryos, 
 
so 
 
we 
 
used 
 
212 
contrast-
stained 
 
CT 
 
scanning 
 
to 
 
simultaneously 
 
visualize 
 
the 
 
developing 
 
brain 
 
and 
 
skull 
 
roof 
 
in 
 
213 
Alligator  mississippiensis 
 
and 
 
Gallus  gallus 
 
(Fig. 
 
6). 
 
We 
 
supplemented 
 
these 
 
data 
 
with 
 
a 
 
214 
developmental 
 
series 
 
of 
 
the 
 
lizard 
 
Chalcides  chalcides. 
 
In 
 
all 
 
three 
 
taxa 
 
examined 
 
there 
 
is 
 
a 
 
direct, 
 
215 
one-
to-
one 
 
correspondence 
 
between 
 
the 
 
developing 
 
forebrain 
 
and 
 
the 
 
frontal 
 
bone 
 
primordium 
 
and 
 
216 
the 
 
developing 
 
midbrain 
 
and 
 
the 
 
parietal 
 
bone 
 
primordium. 
 
Moreover, 
 
this 
 
relationship 
 
can 
 
be 
 
seen 
 
217 
to 
 
 
 
exist 
 
 
 
in 
 
 
 
mouse 
 
 
 
and 
 
 
 
opossum, 
 
though 
 
it 
 
has 
 
attracted 
 
little 
 
comment29. 
 
Contrary 
 
to 
 
a 
 
recent 
 
218 
report 
 
based 
 
on 
 
1937 
 
data 
 
from 
 
de 
 
Beer30, 
 
the 
 
initial 
 
parietal 
 
ossifications 
 
in 
 
chicken 
 
and 
 
mammals, 
 
219 
as 
 
well 
 
as 
 
in 
 
non-
avian 
 
reptiles, 
 
appear 
 
in 
 
the 
 
same 
 
topological 
 
position 
 
relative 
 
to 
 
the 
 
brain, 
 
the 
 
220 
other 
 
bones 
 
of 
 
the 
 
skull 
 
(notably 
 
the 
 
squamosal), 
 
and 
 
the 
 
chondrocranium 
 
(Fig. 
 
5). 
 
Our 
 
results 
 
221 
therefore 
 
support 
 
the 
 
notion 
 
that 
 
the 
 
brain 
 
plays 
 
an 
 
important 
 
role 
 
in 
 
patterning 
 
the 
 
skull 
 
roof. 
222 
Conclusions 
223 
We 
 
have 
 
shown 
 
that 
 
across 
 
the 
 
great 
 
change 
 
in 
 
brain 
 
size 
 
and 
 
shape 
 
in 
 
the 
 
evolution 
 
of 
 
birds 
 
from 
 
224 
the 
 
reptile 
 
ancestor, 
 
the 
 
skull 
 
roof 
 
tracks 
 
the 
 
brain 
 
early 
 
in 
 
ontogeny 
 
and 
 
then 
 
becomes 
 
decoupled, 
 
225 
  
9 
 
with 
 
a 
 
truncation 
 
of 
 
this 
 
decoupling 
 
occurring 
 
in 
 
Coelurosauria. 
 
The 
 
skull 
 
roof 
 
is 
 
remarkably 
 
226 
conservative 
 
across 
 
reptiles, 
 
and 
 
we 
 
found 
 
no 
 
evidence 
 
that 
 
the 
 
avian 
 
parietal 
 
is 
 
anything 
 
other 
 
than 
 
227 
a 
 
structure 
 
homologous 
 
to 
 
the 
 
ancestral 
 
reptilian 
 
parietal. 
 
The 
 
novel 
 
and 
 
dramatic 
 
posterior 
 
228 
expansion 
 
of 
 
the 
 
avian 
 
frontal 
 
may 
 
be 
 
stimulated 
 
by 
 
the 
 
contribution 
 
of 
 
additional 
 
skeletal 
 
229 
progenitor 
 
cells, 
 
most 
 
likely 
 
of 
 
mesodermal 
 
origin. 
 
Overall 
 
evidence 
 
indicates 
 
that 
 
this 
 
expansion 
 
of 
 
230 
the 
 
frontal 
 
is 
 
not 
 
a 
 
product 
 
of 
 
fusion 
 
with 
 
the 
 
parietal. 
 
Finally, 
 
we 
 
have 
 
shown 
 
for 
 
the 
 
first 
 
time 
 
a 
 
231 
one-
to-
one 
 
correspondence 
 
in 
 
embryos 
 
between 
 
major 
 
parts 
 
of 
 
the 
 
brain 
 
and 
 
the 
 
early 
 
ossifications 
 
232 
of 
 
the 
 
skull-
roof 
 
elements, 
 
a 
 
condition 
 
likely 
 
ancestral 
 
to 
 
all 
 
amniotes 
 
and 
 
possibly 
 
to 
 
all 
 
233 
osteichthyans. 
 
This 
 
relationship, 
 
however, 
 
is 
 
dynamic 
 
during 
 
ontogeny, 
 
and 
 
the 
 
nature 
 
of 
 
the 
 
relation 
 
234 
in 
 
adults 
 
shifts 
 
during 
 
the 
 
evolution 
 
of 
 
the 
 
avian 
 
lineage. 
 
This 
 
result 
 
serves 
 
as 
 
an 
 
example 
 
of 
 
235 
character 
 
non-
independence: 
 
the 
 
enlargement 
 
of 
 
the 
 
brain 
 
had 
 
widespread 
 
consequences 
 
on 
 
236 
surrounding 
 
cranial 
 
elements, 
 
affecting 
 
the 
 
entire 
 
architecture 
 
of 
 
the 
 
skull. 
 
It 
 
also 
 
highlights 
 
the 
 
fact 
 
237 
that 
 
developmental 
 
data 
 
by 
 
themselves 
 
are 
 
not 
 
sufficient 
 
to 
 
determine 
 
homology 
 
and 
 
must 
 
be 
 
238 
interpreted 
 
within 
 
a 
 
phylogenetic 
 
framework 
 
provided 
 
by 
 
the 
 
fossil 
 
record 
 
and 
 
comparative 
 
239 
morphology. 
 
Finally, 
 
it 
 
raises 
 
the 
 
question 
 
of 
 
whether 
 
the 
 
intimate 
 
association 
 
of 
 
the 
 
frontal 
 
and 
 
240 
parietal 
 
with 
 
the 
 
brain, 
 
which 
 
is 
 
known 
 
to 
 
act 
 
as 
 
a 
 
major 
 
signaling 
 
center 
 
at 
 
least 
 
in 
 
terms 
 
of 
 
241 
facial 
 
development, 
 
is 
 
the 
 
reason 
 
for 
 
their 
 
universal 
 
conservation 
 
in 
 
bony 
 
vertebrates; 
 
and 
 
whether 
 
242 
the 
 
repeated 
 
losses 
 
of 
 
posterior 
 
cranial 
 
elements 
 
such 
 
as 
 
the 
 
postparietal, 
 
tabulars, 
 
and 
 
243 
supratemporals 
 
have 
 
to 
 
do 
 
with 
 
their 
more 
peripheral 
 
positions 
 
with 
 
respect 
 
to 
 
an 
 
influential 
 
source 
 
244 
of 
 
molecular 
 
developmental 
 
patterning 
 
information.

The 
 
3D 
 
configurations 
 
of 
 
landmarks 
 
were 
 
digitized 
 
with 
 
VGStudio 
 
on 
 
the 
 
CT 
 
scan 
 
data 
 
for 
 
all 
 
the 
 
282 
taxa 
 
included 
 
in 
 
this 
 
study. 
 
Only 
 
one 
 
side 
 
of 
 
the 
 
braincase 
 
was 
 
landmarked. 
 
The 
 
right 
 
or 
 
left 
 
side 
 
283 
of 
 
the 
 
braincase 
 
was 
 
chosen 
 
on 
 
the 
 
base 
 
of 
 
the 
 
presence 
 
or 
 
absence 
 
of 
 
deformation, 
 
quality 
 
of 
 
284 
preservation 
 
and 
 
completeness 
 
of 
 
the 
 
specimen. 
 
In 
 
the 
 
case 
 
of 
 
Garudimimus, 
 
we 
 
placed 
 
the 
 
285 
landmarks 
 
on 
 
the 
 
right 
 
side 
 
of 
 
the 
 
braincase, 
 
because 
 
it 
 
was 
 
less 
 
deformed 
 
as 
 
suggested 
 
by 
 
the 
 
286 
more 
 
rounded 
 
morphology 
 
of 
 
the 
 
orbit31. 
 
 
287 
Generalized 
 
Procrustes 
 
analysis 
 
(GPA)32 
 
was 
 
applied 
 
in 
 
order 
 
to 
 
remove 
 
information 
 
relating 
 
to 
 
the 
 
288 
location, 
 
size 
 
and 
 
orientation 
 
of 
 
the 
 
landmark 
 
configurations. 
 
The 
 
three-
dimensional 
 
coordinates 
 
of 
 
289 
landmarks 
 
were 
 
subjected 
 
to 
 
a 
 
full 
 
GPA, 
 
given 
 
the 
 
reduced 
 
sensitivity 
 
to 
 
outliers 
 
of 
 
this 
 
approach33. 
 
290 
Analysis 
 
were 
 
performed 
 
using 
 
MorphoJ 
 
v. 
 
1.03b34, 
 
which 
 
automatically 
 
reflects 
 
specimens 
 
that 
 
were 
 
291 
digitized 
 
on 
 
alternative 
 
sides. 
 
Major 
 
patterns 
 
of 
 
morphological 
 
variability 
 
were 
 
then 
 
extracted 
 
using 
 
292 
Principal 
 
component 
 
analysis 
 
(PCA) 
 
on 
 
the 
 
Procrustes-
aligned 
 
coordinates. 
293 
Delineation 
 
of 
 
clusters 
 
(that 
 
is, 
 
groups 
 
of 
 
organisms 
 
with 
 
similar 
 
morphology) 
 
was 
 
done 
 
using 
 
k-
294 
means 
 
clustering35. 
 
The 
 
method 
 
aims 
 
at 
 
partitioning 
 
all 
 
observations 
 
into 
 
k 
 
groups 
 
such 
 
that 
 
the 
 
sum 
 
295 
of 
 
squares 
 
from 
 
all 
 
observations 
 
to 
 
their 
 
assigned 
 
cluster 
 
centers 
 
is 
 
minimized. 
 
Given 
 
the 
 
heuristic 
 
296 
nature 
 
of 
 
the 
 
method, 
 
results 
 
shown 
 
derive 
 
from 
 
initiating 
 
the 
 
process 
 
from 
 
1000 
 
different 
 
randomly 
 
297 
located 
 
cluster 
 
centers. 
 
Number 
 
of 
 
clusters 
 
in 
 
each 
 
case 
 
was 
 
determined 
 
using 
 
R 
 
package 
 
NbClust36 
 
298 
that 
 
provides 
 
30 
 
metrics 
 
to 
 
evaluate 
 
the 
 
optimal 
 
number 
 
of 
 
clusters 
 
in 
 
a 
 
dataset. 
 
In 
 
all 
 
cases 
 
(Fig. 
 
299 
3, 
 
Fig. 
 
S2), 
 
clustering 
 
was 
 
performed 
 
using 
 
all 
 
principal 
 
components 
 
that 
 
explained 
 
a 
 
variance 
 
> 
 
300 
1%, 
 
and 
 
the 
 
number 
 
of 
 
clusters 
 
chosen 
 
was 
 
that 
 
supported 
 
by 
 
the 
 
majority 
 
of 
 
metrics. 
 
 
301 
We 
 
used 
 
the 
 
R 
 
package 
 
geomorph37-
38 
 
to 
 
test 
 
the 
 
hypothesis 
 
of 
 
modularity 
 
between 
 
skull 
 
roof 
 
and 
 
302 
brain. 
 
The 
 
Covariance 
 
Ratio 
 
(CR) 
 
was 
 
chosen 
 
as 
 
a 
 
measure 
 
to 
 
characterize 
 
the 
 
degree 
 
of 
 
covariance 
 
303 
between 
 
these 
 
two 
 
a  priori 
 
defined 
 
modules39. 
 
CR 
 
was 
 
preferred 
 
over 
 
the 
 
widely 
 
used 
 
RV 
 
304 
coefficient40, 
 
because 
 
it 
 
is 
 
not 
 
influenced 
 
by 
 
attributes 
 
of 
 
the 
 
data 
 
such 
 
as 
 
the 
 
sample 
 
size 
 
and 
 
the 
 
305 
number 
 
of 
 
variables39. 
 
Briefly, 
 
this 
 
metric 
 
represents 
 
the 
 
overall 
 
covariation 
 
between 
 
defined 
 
modules 
 
306 
relative 
 
to 
 
the 
 
overall 
 
covariation 
 
found 
 
within 
 
them. 
 
For 
 
random 
 
sets 
 
of 
 
variables, 
 
the 
 
CR 
 
307 
coefficient 
 
has 
 
an 
 
expected 
 
value 
 
of 
 
one; 
 
significant 
 
departures 
 
towards 
 
lower 
 
values 
 
are 
 
indicative 
 
308 
of 
 
modularity. 
 
Significance 
 
was 
 
tested 
 
using 
 
a 
 
permutation 
 
test 
 
which 
 
randomly 
 
reassigns 
 
landmarks 
 
309 
  
12 
 
into 
 
groups 
 
of 
 
equal 
 
size 
 
as 
 
the 
 
original 
 
partitions, 
 
and 
 
calculates 
 
the 
 
CR 
 
value 
 
for 
 
the 
 
generated 
 
310 
subdivisions 
 
of 
 
landmarks. 
 
The 
 
degree 
 
of 
 
modularity 
 
between 
 
the 
 
skull 
 
roof 
 
and 
 
the 
 
brain 
 
was 
 
311 
tested 
 
using: 
 
A) 
 
the 
 
full 
 
set 
 
of 
 
digitized 
 
landmark 
 
configurations 
 
(n 
 
= 
 
21), 
 
and 
 
B) 
 
only 
 
those 
 
312 
corresponding 
 
to 
 
adult 
 
specimens 
 
(n 
 
= 
 
17). 
 
The 
 
sampling 
 
employed 
 
in 
 
the 
 
first 
 
set 
 
leads 
 
to 
 
313 
difficulties 
 
interpreting 
 
the 
 
results, 
 
since 
 
they 
 
are 
 
determined 
 
by 
 
a 
 
mix 
 
of 
 
ontogenetic 
 
and 
 
314 
evolutionary 
 
signals 
 
of 
 
integration 
 
across 
 
structures41. 
 
Therefore, 
 
results 
 
in 
 
the 
 
main 
 
text 
 
correspond 
 
315 
to 
 
those 
 
of 
 
set 
 
B, 
 
which 
 
only 
 
assesses 
 
the 
 
degree 
 
of 
 
evolutionary 
 
integration. 
 
In 
 
both 
 
cases, 
 
we 
 
316 
performed 
 
104 
 
permutations, 
 
and 
 
P 
 
values 
 
were 
 
empirically 
 
calculated 
 
as 
 
the 
 
fraction 
 
of 
 
317 
permutations 
 
with 
 
CR 
 
values 
 
lower 
 
than 
 
the 
 
original. 
 
The 
 
analysis 
 
of 
 
set 
 
A 
 
(i.e., 
 
including 
 
the 
 
318 
landmark 
 
configurations 
 
of 
 
the 
 
chicken 
 
and 
 
crocodile 
 
embryos), 
 
results 
 
in 
 
a 
 
significant 
 
degree 
 
of 
 
319 
modularity 
 
between 
 
skull 
 
roof 
 
and 
 
brain 
 
(CR 
 
= 
 
0.967, 
 
P 
 
= 
 
0.031). 
 
This 
 
might 
 
provide 
 
further 
 
320 
evidence 
 
for 
 
the 
 
morphological 
 
decoupling 
 
between 
 
the 
 
two 
 
structures 
 
during 
 
ontogeny, 
 
as 
 
discussed 
 
321 
in 
 
the 
 
main 
 
text, 
 
but 
 
once 
 
again 
 
caution 
 
should 
 
be 
 
taken 
 
when 
 
interpreting 
 
this 
 
result. 
 
 
322 
In 
 
order 
 
to 
 
further 
 
explore 
 
the 
 
morphological 
 
covariance 
 
between 
 
skull 
 
roof 
 
elements 
 
and 
 
brain 
 
323 
regions, 
 
we 
 
measured 
 
the 
 
relative 
 
positions 
 
of 
 
the 
 
fronto-
parietal 
 
and 
 
forebrain-
midbrain 
 
sutures. 
 
324 
Sagittal 
 
sections 
 
of 
 
the 
 
braincase 
 
and 
 
brain 
 
of 
 
all 
 
adults 
 
were 
 
extracted 
 
from 
 
the 
 
CT 
 
scans 
 
using 
 
325 
VGStudio. 
 
Images 
 
were 
 
then 
 
imported 
 
into 
 
tpsDIG2 
 
v. 
 
2.2242, 
 
where 
 
the 
 
distance 
 
between 
 
the 
 
326 
anterior 
 
tip 
 
of 
 
the 
 
olfactory 
 
bulbs 
 
and 
 
the 
 
foramen 
 
magnum 
 
was 
 
measured 
 
as 
 
the 
 
curved 
 
line 
 
327 
joining 
 
those 
 
points 
 
along 
 
the 
 
internal 
 
side 
 
of 
 
the 
 
skull. 
 
This 
 
measure 
 
was 
 
used 
 
as 
 
a 
 
proxy 
 
for 
 
the 
 
328 
overall 
 
skull 
 
roof 
 
length. 
 
The 
 
relative 
 
positions 
 
of 
 
both 
 
fronto-
parietal 
 
and 
 
fore-
mid 
 
brain 
 
sutures 
 
329 
along 
 
the 
 
same 
 
line 
 
was 
 
quantified 
 
as 
 
their 
 
distance 
 
to 
 
the 
 
tip 
 
of 
 
the 
 
olfactory 
 
bulbs 
 
divided 
 
by 
 
the 
 
330 
overall 
 
length, 
 
thus 
 
eliminating 
 
differences 
 
due 
 
to 
 
specimen 
 
size. 
331 
A 
 
relationship 
 
between 
 
the 
 
positions 
 
of 
 
the 
 
fronto-
parietal 
 
suture 
 
and 
 
forebrain-
midbrain 
 
suture 
 
was 
 
332 
explored 
 
using 
 
a 
 
combination 
 
of 
 
ordinary 
 
and 
 
phylogenetic 
 
linear 
 
models. 
 
For 
 
the 
 
latter, 
 
a 
 
333 
phylogenetic 
 
supertree 
 
was 
 
created 
 
in 
 
the 
 
software 
 
Mesquite 
 
v 
 
3.0443. 
 
The 
 
topology 
 
of 
 
the 
 
tree 
 
was 
 
334 
based 
 
on 
 
Pinheiro 
 
et 
 
al.44 
 
for 
 
early 
 
diapsids 
 
and 
 
Archosauromorpha, 
 
Gauthier 
 
et 
 
al.45 
 
for 
 
Squamata, 
 
335 
Nesbitt46 
 
for 
 
Archosauriformes 
 
and 
 
Archosauria, 
 
Carrano 
 
et

for 
 
Tetanurae, 
 
Brusatte 
 
et

for 
 
336 
Coelurosauria 
 
and 
 
Prum 
 
et 
 
al.49 
 
for 
 
Aves. 
 
A 
 
time-
scaled 
 
version 
 
of 
 
the 
 
phylogenetic 
 
tree 
 
was 
 
built 
 
337 
  
13 
 
using 
 
the 
 
calibration 
 
method 
 
described 
 
in 
 
Brusatte50. 
 
First 
 
and 
 
last 
 
appearances 
 
of 
 
all 
 
fossil 
 
taxa 
 
338 
were 
 
recorded 
 
from 
 
the 
 
primary 
 
literature 
 
(See 
 
Table 
 
S2 
 
for 
 
ages 
 
of 
 
the 
 
taxa 
 
and 
 
corresponding 
 
339 
citations) 
 
and 
 
used 
 
to 
 
estimate 
 
the 
 
time 
 
of 
 
divergence 
 
of 
 
the 
 
clades 
 
represented 
 
in 
 
the 
 
analysis. 
 
This 
 
340 
was 
 
done 
 
using 
 
the 
 
timePaleoPhy 
 
function 
 
in 
 
the 
 
R 
 
package 
 
paleotree51. 
 
Molecular 
 
estimates 
 
for 
 
the 
 
341 
divergence 
 
of 
 
crown 
 
clades 
 
were 
 
drawn 
 
from 
 
Shedlock 
 
& 
 
Edwards52 
 
and 
 
Prum 
 
et  al.49, 
 
and 
 
used 
 
to 
 
342 
constrain 
 
minimum 
 
ages 
 
for 
 
the 
 
respective 
 
nodes. 
 
To 
 
account 
 
for 
 
uncertainty 
 
in 
 
both 
 
branch 
 
length 
 
343 
estimates 
 
and 
 
phylogenetic 
 
relationships 
 
among 
 
paravian 
 
lineages, 
 
100 
 
different 
 
trees 
 
were 
 
generated 
 
344 
by 
 
assigning 
 
an 
 
age 
 
for 
 
each 
 
taxon 
 
through 
 
random 
 
sampling 
 
between 
 
its 
 
first 
 
and 
 
last 
 
appearance 
 
345 
in 
 
the 
 
fossil 
 
record, 
 
as 
 
well 
 
as 
 
randomly 
 
resolving 
 
the 
 
polytomy 
 
at 
 
the 
 
base 
 
of 
 
Paraves. 
 
The 
 
346 
resulting 
 
100 
 
trees 
 
were 
 
subsequently 
 
used 
 
in 
 
all 
 
following 
 
analysis. 
347 
We 
 
considered 
 
three 
 
increasingly 
 
complex 
 
least-
squares 
 
regression 
 
models: 
 
a 
 
model 
 
of 
 
simple 
 
348 
allometry, 
 
a 
 
model 
 
incorporating 
 
different 
 
intercepts 
 
for 
 
coelurosaur 
 
and 
 
non-
coelurosaur 
 
diapsids 
 
but 
 
349 
with 
 
same 
 
slope, 
 
and 
 
a 
 
model 
 
with 
 
both 
 
different 
 
intercepts 
 
and 
 
slopes 
 
(shown 
 
in 
 
Table 
 
S3 
 
as 
 
350 
models 
 
A, 
 
B 
 
and 
 
C, 
 
respectively). 
 
Division 
 
of 
 
the 
 
included 
 
taxa 
 
into 
 
a 
 
coelurosaur 
 
and 
 
a 
 
non-
351 
coelurosaur 
 
group 
 
was 
 
applied 
 
on 
 
the 
 
base 
 
of 
 
the 
 
shift 
 
in 
 
the 
 
organization 
 
of 
 
braincase-
brain 
 
found 
 
352 
through 
 
the 
 
analyses 
 
performed 
 
in 
 
this 
 
study. 
 
As 
 
already 
 
stated, 
 
ordinary 
 
least 
 
squares 
 
(OLS) 
 
and 
 
353 
phylogenetic 
 
generalized 
 
least 
 
squares 
 
(PGLS) 
 
approaches 
 
of 
 
these 
 
three 
 
models 
 
were 
 
performed 
 
(for 
 
354 
the 
 
later, 
 
we 
 
used 
 
the 
 
R 
 
package 
 
caper.53). 
 
A 
 
dummy 
 
variable 
 
representing 
 
clade 
 
membership

were 
 
360 
compared 
 
using 
 
AIC 
 
weights, 
 
given 
 
that 
 
different 
 
scenarios 
 
are 
 
not 
 
nested 
 
within 
 
each 
 
other. 
 
On 
 
the 
 
361 
other 
 
hand, 
 
the 
 
fit 
 
of 
 
progressively 
 
more 
 
complex 
 
models 
 
(i.e. 
 
simple 
 
allometry, 
 
allometry 
 
with 
 
362 
clade-
specific 
 
intercepts 
 
and 
 
allometry 
 
with 
 
clade-
specific 
 
intercepts 
 
and 
 
slopes) 
 
was 
 
analyzed 
 
using 
 
363 
log-
likelihood 
 
ratio 
 
tests 
 
(LRT). 
 
The 
 
model 
 
with 
 
the 
 
best 
 
fit 
 
was 
 
considered 
 
to 
 
be 
 
the 
 
one 
 
with 
 
the 
 
364 
lowest 
 
AIC 
 
value 
 
overall. 
365 
  
14 
 
Several 
 
lines 
 
of 
 
evidence 
 
favored 
 
the 
 
OLS 
 
model 
 
including 
 
different 
 
intercepts 
 
but 
 
equal 
 
slopes 
 
for 
 
366 
the 
 
two 
 
clades 
 
as 
 
the 
 
preferred 
 
one, 
 
the 
 
results 
 
of 
 
which 
 
are 
 
shown 
 
in 
 
Fig. 
 
4 
 
of 
 
the 
 
main 
 
text.  
367 
This 
 
model 
 
had 
 
the 
 
overall 
 
smallest 
 
AIC 
 
value, 
 
and 
 
represented 
 
a 
 
significant 
 
improvement 
 
with 
 
368 
respect 
 
to 
 
the 
 
OLS 
 
simple 
 
allometry 
 
(P 
 
= 
 
0.000); 
 
while 
 
the 
 
addition 
 
of 
 
different 
 
slopes 
 
for 
 
each 
 
369 
clade 
 
was 
 
not 
 
considered 
 
to 
 
further 
 
improve 
 
the 
 
model 
 
(P 
 
= 
 
0.394). 
 
This 
 
was 
 
also 
 
confirmed 
 
370 
through 
 
the 
 
use 
 
of 
 
a 
 
partial 
 
F-
test 
 
(F 
 
= 
 
0.57, 
 
P 
 
= 
 
0.464). 
 
In 
 
fact, 
 
the 
 
regression 
 
residuals 
 
were 
 
371 
found 
 
to 
 
lack 
 
phylogenetic 
 
signal, 
 
with 
 
a 
 
value 
 
of 
 
K 
 
= 
 
0.2060 
 
and 
 
λ 
 
= 
 
0.73 
 
(P 
 
= 
 
0.64 
 
and 
 
0.37, 
 
372 
respectively, 
 
using 
 
100 
 
simulations 
 
with 
 
function 
 
phylosig 
 
of 
 
R 
 
package 
 
phytools61). 
 
Under 
 
such 
 
373 
situation, 
 
OLS 
 
approaches 
 
have 
 
an 
 
estimation 
 
accuracy 
 
substantially 
 
higher 
 
than 
 
PGLS59. 
 
Allowing 
 
374 
for 
 
the 
 
simultaneous 
 
estimation 
 
of 
 
branch 
 
length 
 
modifying 
 
parameters 
 
also 
 
confirmed 
 
this 
 
result. 
 
375 
The 
 
second 
 
best 
 
model 
 
including 
 
a 
 
clade 
 
effect 
 
with 
 
equal 
 
slopes 
 
is 
 
a 
 
PGLS 
 
approach 
 
that 
 
includes 
 
376 
a 
 
parameter 
 
λ 
 
= 
 
0 
 
and 
 
δ 
 
= 
 
0.019, 
 
transforming 
 
the 
 
tree 
 
into 
 
a 
 
star 
 
phylogeny 
 
and 
 
(almost 
 
377 
completely) 
 
homogenizing 
 
terminal 
 
branch 
 
lengths. 
 
This 
 
transformation 
 
effectively 
 
eliminates 
 
residual 
 
378 
correlation 
 
due 
 
to 
 
shared 
 
evolutionary 
 
history 
 
from 
 
the 
 
variance-
covariance 
 
matrix 
 
of 
 
the 
 
linear 
 
379 
model 
 
(analogous 
 
to 
 
the 
 
PGLSλ 
 
approach 
 
discussed 
 
by 
 
Revell59, 
 
with 
 
the 
 
addition 
 
of 
 
a 
 
parameter 
 
δ 
 
380 
≈ 
 
0 
 
to 
 
eliminate 
 
differences 
 
in 
 
terminal 
 
branch 
 
lengths), 
 
resulting 
 
in 
 
an 
 
approach 
 
equivalent 
 
to 
 
an 
 
381 
OLS.
