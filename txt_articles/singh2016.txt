a r t I C l e S
Schizophrenia is a common, debilitating psychiatric disorder that 
is characterized by positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions 
and disorganization) and negative symptoms (impaired motivation, 
reduced spontaneous speech and social withdrawal). It is associ-
ated with cognitive impairment, decreased social and occupational 
functioning, and increased mortality, with a 12–15-year reduction in 
lifespan1–3. Schizophrenia has a lifetime risk of ~0.7% and a substan-
tial genetic component, with a sibling recurrence risk ratio of 9.0 and 
an estimated heritability of up to 81% (refs. 4,5).
The genetic architecture of schizophrenia involves a combination of 
common, rare and de novo risk variants. At one end of this spectrum, a 
genome-wide association study of 36,989 cases identified 108 loci con-
taining alleles of individually small effect (median odds ratio = 1.08)6, 
 
whereas, at the other, at least 11 rare, recurrent copy number vari-
ants (CNVs) (for example, at chromosomes 1q21.1, 15q13.3 and 
22q11.2) individually confer substantial risk for schizophrenia 
(ORs 2–60)7–10. A recent case-control exome sequencing study 
demonstrated a burden of rare disruptive variants across a set of 
2,546 genes selected on the basis of a variety of biological hypoth-
eses about schizophrenia risk and previous genome-wide screens, 
including GWAS, CNV and de novo mutation studies11. This study 
did not, however, identify any individual schizophrenia risk genes 
at a Bonferroni P value of 1.25 × 10−6 (Online Methods). Parent-
proband trio studies have sought to increase power by focusing on 
de novo mutations: the rarity of damaging events makes it possible 
 
to observe statistically significant recurrence of mutations in indi-
vidual genes with smaller sample sizes than would be required in 
a case-control design. Three such studies in schizophrenia have 
found suggestive evidence for candidate genes, including EHMT1, 
DLG2, TAF13 and SETD1A9,12,13. The statistical significance of 
 
de novo recurrence is highly dependent on the specification of gene-
specific mutation rates, which are difficult to calibrate for indels and 
CNVs (Online Methods). Because these genes are supported by two 
de novo events each, of which all but one (in TAF13) are either an 
indel or CNV, further evidence is needed to firmly establish these 
as susceptibility genes.

By analyzing the whole-exome sequences of 4,264 schizophrenia cases, 9,343 controls and 1,077 trios, we identified a genome-
wide significant association between rare loss-of-function (LoF) variants in SETD1A and risk for schizophrenia (P = 3.3 × 10−9). 
We found only two heterozygous LoF variants in 45,376 exomes from individuals without a neuropsychiatric diagnosis, indicating 
that SETD1A is substantially depleted of LoF variants in the general population. Seven of the ten individuals with schizophrenia 
carrying SETD1A LoF variants also had learning difficulties. We further identified four SETD1A LoF carriers among 4,281 children 
with severe developmental disorders and two more carriers in an independent sample of 5,720 Finnish exomes, both with notable 
neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Together, our observations indicate that LoF variants in SETD1A cause a range of neurodevelopmental 
disorders, including schizophrenia. Combining these data with previous common variant evidence, we suggest that epigenetic 
dysregulation, specifically in the histone H3K4 methylation pathway, is an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.

a r t I C l e S
Two insights have emerged from these early results in schizophre-
nia. First, genetic risk loci have implicated general biological processes 
involved in pathogenesis, including histone methylation (common 
variants)14, transmission at glutamatergic synapses and translational 
regulation by the fragile X mental retardation protein (rare and 
 
de novo variants)11,12. Second, studies of common and rare variation 
support a highly polygenic architecture involving hundreds of genes, 
suggesting that very large sample sizes will be required to convinc-
ingly identify individual risk genes. This polygenicity is reminiscent 
of other neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD), which required many thousands of exome sequences and the 
integration of de novo mutations with case-control burden of rare 
variants to identify genes at genome-wide significance15,16.
RESULTS
Case-control analysis of schizophrenia exomes
We sequenced the exomes of 1,887 (1,488 UK and 399 Finnish) indi-
viduals with schizophrenia and 7,585 (5,469 UK and 2,116 Finnish) 
individuals without a known neuropsychiatric diagnosis. We jointly 
called each case set with its nationality-matched controls, but still 
observed substantial batch effects from the use of different exome 
capture reagents used at different time points in the experiment 
(Supplementary Fig. 1). We therefore performed careful qual-
ity control (QC) in each set to narrow our analysis to regions with 
high-quality data in all samples and to remove outlier samples and 
variants (Online Methods and Supplementary Fig. 2), leaving a total 
 
of 1,745 cases and 6,789 controls (Fig. 1). To increase power for gene 
discovery, we combined our data set with exome sequences of 2,519 
Swedish schizophrenia cases and 2,554 controls from a previous 
study11. The average number of coding SNPs and indels varied among 
these three sample sets as a result of differences in exome capture 
technology, QC procedures and sample ancestry, but were closely 
matched between cases and controls in each set (Supplementary 
Figs. 3–5). We restricted our analyses to rare variants, stratified 
by allele frequency (singletons, <0.1%, and <0.5%) and function 
 
(LoF and damaging missense variants; Online Methods). In total, this 
joint discovery set consisted of 357,088 damaging missense and 55,955 
LoF variants called in 4,264 cases and 9,343 controls (Fig. 1).
We replicated the enrichment of rare LoF variants in the previously 
implicated set of 2,456 genes11 in our UK and Finnish schizophrenia 
data sets (P = 7 × 10−4; Online Methods). Having confirmed that rare 
disruptive variants spread among many genes are associated with schiz-
ophrenia risk, we tested for an excess of disruptive variants in each of 
18,271 genes in cases compared with controls (Online Methods). Despite 
our sample size, the per-gene statistics followed a null distribution 
 
in all tests, and we were unable to implicate any gene via case-control 
burden of disruptive variants (Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7).
LoF variants in SETD1A are associated with schizophrenia
To determine whether the integration of de novo mutations with case-
control burden might succeed in discovering risk genes in schizophrenia, 
we aggregated, processed and re-annotated de novo mutations in 1,077 
schizophrenia probands from seven published studies, and found 118 
LoF and 662 missense variants12,13,17–21 (Supplementary Table 1). 38 
genes had two or more de novo nonsynonymous mutations, two of which 
(SETD1A and TAF13) had been previously suggested as candidate schiz-
ophrenia genes12,13. We found that the 754 genes with de novo mutations 
were significantly enriched in rare LoF variants in cases compared with 
controls from our main data set. The most significant enrichment across 
allele frequency thresholds and functional class was for the test of LoF 
variants with MAF < 0.1% (P = 2.1 × 10−4; OR 1.08, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 1.02–1.14), which we focused on for subsequent analysis.
Motivated by this overlap of genes with de novo mutations and excess 
case-control burden, we meta-analyzed de novo variants in the 1,077 
published schizophrenia trios with rare LoF variants (MAF < 0.1%) 
in 4,264 cases and 9,343 controls. We used two analytical approaches, 
one based on Fisher’s method to combine de novo and case-control 
P values, and the other using the transmission and de novo associa-
tion (TADA) model to integrate de novo, transmitted and case-control 
variation using a hierarchical Bayesian framework15,22 (Fig. 1). We 
focused on results that were significant in both analyses and that did 
not depend on the choice of parameters in TADA (Online Methods and 
Supplementary Fig. 8). In both methods, loss-of-function mutations 
in a single gene, SETD1A, were significantly associated with schizo-
phrenia risk (Fisher’s combined P = 3.3 × 10−9; Table 1). We observed 
three de novo mutations and seven case LoF variants in our discovery 
cohort and none in our controls (Fig. 2). In one of the seven case 
carriers, direct genotyping in parents confirmed that the LoF variant 
(c.518-2A>G) was a de novo event, but genotypes were not available for 
the other parents. We looked for additional SETD1A LoF variants in 
unpublished whole exomes from 2,435 unrelated schizophrenia cases 
and 3,685 controls23, but found none (Table 1). Thus, in more than 
20,000 exomes, we observed ten case and zero control LoF variants 
(corrected OR 35.2, 95% CI 4.5–4,528). Although the confidence inter-
vals were wide, rare LoF variants in SETD1A conferred substantial risk 
for schizophrenia. No other gene approached genome-wide signifi-
cance (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10).
Robustness of the SETD1A association

SETD1A in unaffected individuals, we examined the exomes of

Consortium (ExAC) database and found only 2 LoF variants24, 
which represented a substantial depletion compared with chance 
expectation (Online Methods, expected value 32.5 LoF SNPs, 
 
P = 4.4 × 10−8). SETD1A is among the 3% most constrained genes 
in the human genome24; LoF variants in SETD1A are almost totally 
absent in the general population. Four of the ten SETD1A carriers 
with schizophrenia had the same two-base deletion at the exon 16 
splice acceptor (c.4582-2delAG>-), at least two of which occurred 
as de novo mutations (Fig. 2). Given that this variant underpinned 
the statistical significance of our observation, we investigated it 
further in several ways. First, to rule out sequencing artifacts, we 
confirmed a clean call where we had access to the raw sequencing 
reads (n = 2) and noted that both published de novo mutations 
at this position had been validated with Sanger sequencing13,20. 
Second, our model, and therefore the test statistic that we report, 
is dependent on a gene-specific mutation rate (Online Methods). 
To address the possibility that the recurrent mutation occurs at a 
hypermutable site (and thus our model is not well calibrated), we 
determined that our observations would be exome-wide significant 
(P < 1.25 × 10−6) even if the mutation rate at this position were up 
to eightfold higher (5.4 × 10−5) than the cumulative LoF rate for 
all other positions in SETD1A (6.6 × 10−6). If the two-base dele-
tion mutation rate were truly this high (that is, greater than 99.99% 
of all per-gene LoF mutation rates), we would expect to find 4.9 
observations in 45,376 non-schizophrenia exomes in ExAC, but 
instead we observed only 1 (Fisher’s exact test, P = 0.044). Using a 
minigene construct, we further found that this two-base deletion 
resulted in the retention of the upstream intron. This was predicted 
to lead to the translation of exon 15, the subsequent intron and an 
out-of-frame translation of exon 16 resulting in a premature stop 
codon (Supplementary Fig. 11 and Online Methods). Finally, if 
 
we ignored the de novo status of variants in our discovery and 
 
replication data sets and used ExAC exomes as additional controls 
(Online Methods and Table 2), LoF variants in SETD1A were sig-
nificantly associated with schizophrenia using a basic test of case-
control burden (P = 2.6 × 10−8, OR 37.6, 95% CI 8.0–353). Taken 
together, these analyses exclude many possible artifacts and provide 
confidence in our conclusion that LoF variants in SETD1A confer 
 
substantial risk for schizophrenia.
SETD1A is associated with severe developmental disorders
All heterozygous carriers of SETD1A LoF variants satisfied the 
full diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, including classic positive 
symptoms such as hallucinations, prominent disorganization and 
paranoid delusions (Table 3). Eight patients had evidence of chronic 
illness, requiring long-term psychiatric services. Notably, of the 
seven SETD1A LoF carriers for whom any information on intellec-
tual functioning was available, one was noted to have severe learning 
 
difficulties and the other six appeared to have mild to moderate learn-
ing difficulties. Four patients were noted to have achieved develop-
mental milestones with clinically salient delays (Table 3). We were 
unable to confirm whether the three Swedish carriers had any form 
of cognitive impairment. This is consistent with previous reports 
that individuals with autism or schizophrenia who have de novo LoF 
 
mutations have a higher rate of cognitive impairment12,25.
To investigate whether SETD1A might be involved in other neu-
rodevelopmental disorders, we looked for de novo LoF mutations in 
SETD1A in 3,581 published trios with autism, severe developmental 
 
disorders (DD) and/or intellectual disability15,26–28, but found 
none. We next turned to an additional 3,148 children with diverse, 
severe, developmental disorders recruited as part of the Deciphering 
Developmental Disorders (DDD) study, and discovered four probands 
with LoF variants in SETD1A (Table 4). Three of these were the recur-
rent exon 16 splice junction indel described above (two de novo, one

frameshift insertion (Fig. 2). We validated all four LoF variants using 
Sanger sequencing. All four probands had developmental delay with 
additional phenotypes that clustered in the larger DDD study (empiri-
cal P = 0.042; Online Methods). A fifth proband was found to have a 
de novo 650-kb deletion that encompassed SETD1A as well as 29 other 
genes (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Online Methods). SETD1A did not 
reach exome-wide significance as a developmental disorder gene in 
the DDD study alone (P = 3.0 × 10−3), but when we jointly analyzed 
all samples, the association was clear to both severe developmental 
disorders and schizophrenia (P = 3.1 × 10−8; Table 1). Because all of 
the DDD SETD1A carriers were under 12 years of age at recruitment 
and schizophrenia rarely manifests at this age29, it remains unknown 
whether these individuals will develop schizophrenia.

two additional heterozygous LoF variants in SETD1A. One individ-
ual with a stop-gain variant was recruited as part of the Northern 
Finnish Intellectual Disability (NFID) cohort with a diagnosis of 
mental retardation, short stature, mild facial dysmorphology and 
EEG abnormalities (Table 4). Notably, this individual was also diag-
nosed with delusional disorder and unspecified psychosis at 15 years 
of age. The second SETD1A LoF carrier belonged to the Northern 
 
Finnish 1966 Birth Cohort (NFBC), a representative, geographically 
based population cohort. This individual had epileptic episodes at 
7 years of age and was diagnosed with an unspecified personality 
disorder by a psychiatrist. Thus, in an additional search for SETD1A 
LoF carriers, only two were found, both in individuals affected 
 
by neuropsychiatric disorders.
De novo burden in neurodevelopmental disorders
Even though our study had an overall sample size comparable to those 
of recent ASD and DD studies that identified 7 ASD genes and 32 DD 
genes15,26, we were only able to implicate a single schizophrenia gene 
at genome-wide significance. To investigate this further, we aggre-
gated de novo mutations identified in 2,297 ASD, 1,113 DD and 566 
control trios with our 1,077 schizophrenia trios and compared the 
rates of de novo events in each group relative to baseline exome-wide 
mutation rates (Online Methods). The rates of de novo mutations 
across damaging missense and LoF variants were significantly higher 
in DD than in ASD, and higher in ASD than in schizophrenia (Fig. 3). 
 
Indeed, the rate of damaging missense variants in schizophrenia 
was not different from baseline rates (P = 0.45) and only nominally 
higher than in controls (P = 0.029), and the rates of LoF variants were 
 
only slightly elevated (P = 5.7 × 10−3). In ASD, by contrast, missense 
(P = 9.4 × 10−10) and LoF (P = 3.7 × 10−15) rates were significantly 
greater than expectation. In developmental disorders, the rates were 
even higher (missense: P = 2.5 × 10−17; LoF: P = 1.3 × 10−31) (Fig. 3). 
Across all genes in the genome, the rate of disruptive de novo variants 
differed markedly across these disorders. Because the recurrence of 
 
de novo mutations is a particularly powerful way to identify risk genes, 
the weak excess of de novo variants in schizophrenia provides at least 
a partial explanation for the limited success of this strategy to date in 
identifying genes for this disorder.
DISCUSSION
We identified an association between rare LoF variants in SETD1A 
and risk of schizophrenia and other severe neurodevelopmental 
phenotypes. A previous report13 suggested SETD1A as a candidate 
schizophrenia gene on the basis of two of the de novo mutations 
included in our analysis. Our study establishes the SETD1A asso-
ciation at a significance exceeding a Bonferroni corrected P value of 
1.25 × 10−6 independent of any specification of gene mutation rate. 
Indeed, in keeping with observations in other neurodevelopmental 
disorder sequencing studies, even larger meta-analyses of schizo-
phrenia exomes will be required to define the phenotypic spectrum 
of SETD1A LoF variant carriers, to rule other candidates in or out, 
 
and to identify new risk genes.
SETD1A, also known as KMT2F, encodes one of the methyltrans-
ferases that catalyze the methylation of lysine residues in histone H3.

a r t I C l e S
Loss-of-function variants in at least five other genes in this family 
result in dominant Mendelian disorders characterized by severe 
developmental phenotypes, including intellectual disability30. These 
include Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (KMT2A), Kleefstra syndrome 
(EHMT1) and Kabuki syndrome (KMT2D) (Supplementary Fig. 13). 
Moreover, rare de novo LoF mutations and copy number variants in 
KMT2C, KMT2E, KDM5B and KDM6B have been recently associated 
with autism risk16. The developmental and cognitive phenotypes of 
SETD1A carriers are consistent with these other Mendelian conditions 
of epigenetic machinery; however, among all genes associated with 
developmental disorders and intellectual disability, SETD1A is the first 
shown to definitively predispose to schizophrenia, offering insights 
into the biological differences underlying these conditions26,31. 
As with other risk genes for severe neurodevelopmental phenotypes, 
it is possible that an allelic series of LoF variants exists in SETD1A, 
where different variants increase risk for different clinical features. 
However, seven of the 16 LoF variant carriers (Fig. 2) have the same 
two base deletion at the splice acceptor of exon-16 (c.4582-2delAG>-): 
four in individuals with schizophrenia and three in individuals diag-
nosed with other developmental disorders. Thus, the same variant is 
associated with both schizophrenia and developmental disorders.
Detailed phenotypes from the DDD and SISu studies suggest that 
SETD1A carriers may have distinctive features, including delayed 
speech and language development, epilepsy, personality disorder 
and facial dysmorphology (Table 4). Although cognitive and devel-
opmental phenotypes in our schizophrenia patients were sparser, 
 
four individuals had delayed developmental milestones, one was 
noted as having mild facial dysmorphology and minimal brain dam-
age and another had epileptic seizures during childhood (Table 3). 
However, impairment of cognitive function is now generally regarded, 
along with positive and negative symptoms, as an integral feature of 
schizophrenia rather than a co-morbidity, and our study, as designed, 
cannot address whether variants in SETD1A are specifically associated 
with the cognitive features of the disorder. Indeed, it would require 
a re-sequencing study with detailed cognitive measurements on 
tens of thousands of patients (Online Methods and Supplementary 
 
Fig. 14) to decisively answer this question.
The clinical heterogeneity observed in carriers of SETD1A LoF vari-
ants is reminiscent of at least 11 large copy number variant syndromes 
which cause schizophrenia in addition to many other developmental 
defects10,32. A canonical example is the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, 
which is characterized by schizophrenia in 22.6% of adult carriers33, 
highly variable intellectual impairment34 and numerous severe 
 
neurological and physical defects35. A considerably larger cohort 
(such as the hundreds of cases of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome studied 
to date) will be needed to accurately estimate the relative penetrance 
of SETD1A LoF variants for schizophrenia, developmental disorders 
and other clinical features.
Although disruptions of SETD1A are very rare events and occur in 
only a small fraction of schizophrenia cases (0.13% in our meta-analysis, 
 
95% CI 0.062–0.24%), several lines of evidence suggest that histone 
H3 methylation is more broadly relevant to schizophrenia. The H3K4 
methylation gene ontology category (GO:51568) showed the strongest 
statistical enrichment among 4,939 biological pathways in GWAS data 
of psychiatric disorders14. This category contains 20 genes, includ-
ing SETD1A and six others (ASH2L, CXXC1, RBBP5, WDR5, DPY30 
and WDR82)36–38 that together form the SET1-COMPASS complex, 
through which SETD1A regulates transcription by targeted methyla-
tion. Indeed, two of the genes in GO:51568 (WDR82 and KMT2E) 
are near genome-wide significant associations to schizophrenia6. 
A previous study of de novo CNVs in schizophrenia trios identified 
one deletion and one duplication overlapping EHMT1, another his-
tone methyltransferase9 that has been implicated in developmental 
delay and a range of congenital abnormalities39. Finally, conserved 
H3K4me3 peaks identified in prefrontal cortical neurons colocalize 
with genes related to biological mechanisms in schizophrenia, includ-
ing glutamatergic and dopaminergic signaling40. Our implication of 
SETD1A therefore contributes to the growing body of evidence that 
chromatin modification, specifically histone H3 methylation, is an 
important mechanism in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.

ONLINE METHODS
Sample collections. Individuals clinically diagnosed with schizophrenia were 
recruited and exome sequenced as part of eight neurodevelopmental collec-
tions (Aberdeen, Collier, Edinburgh, Gurling, Muir, UK-SCZ, Finnish-SCZ and 
Kuusamo) in the UK10K sequencing project. Matched population controls were 
selected from non-psychiatric arms of the UK10K project, healthy blood donors 
from the INTERVAL project, and five Finnish population studies (ENGAGE, 
Familial dyslipidemia, FINRISK, Health 2000 and METSIM). Additional details 
on the UK10K data set are described in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4, and 
the sequence data were deposited into the European Genome-phenome Archive 
(EGA) under study accession code EGAO00000000079. The Swedish schizophre-
nia case-control study had been described in an earlier publication11, and we 
acquired processed VCFs for this data set via dbGaP authorized access (accession 
code: phs000473.v1.p1). The Deciphering Developmental Disorders study data 
set included 4,281 children with severe, undiagnosed developmental disorders. 
Probands and their parents were exome-sequenced in the project in order to 
identify novel genes associated with developmental disorders. Patient recruit-
ment, sample collection, sequencing production, and initial analysis of the data 
set were described in detail in a previous publication26. The sequence data were 
deposited into the EGA under study accession EGAS00001000775.
The Sequencing Initiative Suomi project is an international collaboration gen-
erating whole genome and whole exome sequence data from Finnish samples, 
and consists of a number of prospective and case-control cohorts, including the 
ENGAGE, FINRISK, Health 2000 and METSIM studies (http://www.sisuproject.
fi/content/cohorts). The Northern Finnish 1966 Birth Cohort (NFBC) is a geo-
graphically based representative birth cohort including 96% (N = 12,068) of all live 
births in the two most northern provinces of Finland in 1966. The NFBC began 
with collection of prenatal information and continued with follow-ups at multiple 
time points resulting in a rich phenotype database of the study participants that 
combines information from hospital records, official registers, questionnaires 
and clinical examinations of the participants. DNA was collected from the study 
participants during the 31-year follow up and extracted from peripheral blood 
using standard protocols. All study participants provided a written informed con-
sent to participate in the study. The ethical review board of the faculty of medi-
cine, University of Oulu, approved the study. The Northern Finnish Intellectual 
Disability Cohort (NFID) is an ongoing sample collection of individuals who 
have been diagnosed with ICD-10 diagnosis of intellectual disability or specific 
developmental disorder of speech and language of unknown etiology (ICD-10 
codes: F70-F79 and F80-F89). The patients were recruited from the Northern 
Ostrobothnia Hospital District in Finland, including the Oulu University Hospital 
Policlinic of Medical Genetics and Tahkokangas Care Home for Disabled. Patients 
were identified through hospital records and during routine visit to the policlinic 
and were initially contacted by a trained research nurse or by their treating physi-
cian. All research subjects and their legal guardians provided a written informed 
consent to participate in the study. The current sample includes 324 patients 
and their first-degree family members (N = 631, 92 full trios) with GWAS and 
WES data available. DNA samples of the participants were extracted primarily 
from peripheral blood. In few sporadic cases where a blood sample could not be 
obtained, DNA was extracted from saliva. The ethical committees of the Northern 
Ostrobothnia Hospital District and the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa 
reviewed and approved the study.
Informed consent was obtained for all samples. Further information is avail-

Sequence data production. 1–3 µg of DNA was sheared to ~100–400 bp using 
either a Covaris E210 or LE220 machine (Covaris) and processed using Illumina 
paired-end DNA library preparation. The DNA was enriched using the Agilent 
SureSelect Human All Exon v.3 or v.5 kits. All libraries were sequenced on the 
Illumina HiSeq 2000 with 75 base paired-end reads in multiple batches accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s protocol. Sequencing reads that failed quality con-
trol (QC) were first removed using the Illumina GA pipeline. Remaining raw 
reads were mapped to the reference genome (UK10K: GRCh37, INTERVAL: 
GRCh37_hs37d5) using BWA (v0.5)41 and duplicate fragments were marked 
using Picard (UK10K: v1.36, INTERVAL: v1.114)42. We used GATK (UK10K: 
v1.1-5; INTERVAL: v3.2-2) to perform local realignment around indels and 
 
recalibrate base qualities in each sample BAM43. All samples were individually 
called using GATK Haplotype Caller (v3.2), merged into batches of 200 samples 
using CombineVCFs, and joint-called using GenotypeVCFs, all at default set-
tings44,45. Supplementary Figure 1 showed that the samples enriched using the 
v.5 kit have lower read depth across the entire exome, but cover a much larger 
percentage of coding regions than in any previous capture. The samples in the 
UK10K project are divided into two batches, clearly reflecting a chemistry change 
that occurred early in the project. The DDD study exomes more closely resem-
bled the UK10K v.3 samples but clear differences in coverage exist between the 
v.3 and custom v.3 capture. Due to different captures used in the UK10K and 
INTERVAL data sets, variant calling was performed at the union of the Agilent 
v.3 and v.5 captures with 100 base pairs of flanking sequence. To harmonize vari-
ant calls across all sequencing batches, we limited subsequent QC and analysis to 
 
variants covered at 7× or more in at least 80% of samples in each sequencing 
batch (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Sample-level quality control. Quality control was performed on each population 
(UK, Finnish and Swedish) separately. We removed samples with a contamination 
fraction ≥3% estimated using VerifyBamID (v1.0)46 or low coverage (≤75% of 
the Gencode v.19 coding region covered at ≥10×). Principal components analysis 
(PCA) was performed using PLINK v1.9 (ref. 47) on a set of high-quality (VQSR 
tranche 99.0%, missingness < 3% and Hardy-Weinberg P < 10−3), LD-pruned 
(r2 > 0.2), common (MAF > 5%) SNPs found in our exome capture and in 1000 
Genomes Project Phase III data. Ten principal components were estimated using 
1000 Genomes samples, onto which we projected all of our cases and controls 
(Supplementary Fig. 5). We verified whether samples had the same popula-
tion ancestry (UK, Finnish or Swedish) as reported in the sample manifests and 
excluded individuals who were of non-European ancestry. We estimated kinship 
coefficients between each sample pair using KING v1.4 (ref. 48) and excluded one 
member of any apparent relative pair (kinship ≥ 0.09375). After sample QC, 6,122 
UK samples (1,353 cases and 4,769 controls), 2,412 Finnish samples (392 cases 
and 2,020 controls) and 5,073 Swedish samples (2,519 cases and 2,554 controls) 
were available for analysis.
Variant-level quality control and annotation. We empirically derived thresholds 
for site and genotype filters that balanced sensitivity and specificity by training 
on the following: ExomeChip genotype calls in 295 UK10K cases and doubleton 
inherited variants (truth sets) and singleton Mendelian inheritance inconsisten-
cies (false set) in 227 trios of the DDD study. We kept SNPs in the VQSR tranche 
with 99.75% sensitivity and with mean genotype quality (GQ) ≥ 30. Individual 
genotypes were retained if they had a GQ ≥ 30, alternate allele read depth (DP1) 
≥ 2, allelic balance (AB) ≥ 0.2, and AB ≤ 0.8. Using these thresholds, we removed 
95.63% of Mendelian errors while retaining 98.38% of doubleton inherited vari-
ants and 99.62% of heterozygous Exomechip SNPs. We kept indels in the VQSR 
tranche with 99.50% sensitivity and with mean GQ ≥ 90. Individual genotypes 
were retained if they had GQ ≥ 90, DP1 ≥ 2, AB ≥ 0.25, and AB ≤ 0.8. Using these 
thresholds, we removed 92.35% of all indel Mendelian errors and retained 93.60% 
of all doubleton inherited indels. We further excluded SNPs and indels with miss-
ingness > 20%, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium χ2 P < 10−8, variants within low-
complexity regions49 and indels with more than two alternate alleles or within 
three base pairs of another indel.
Following sample and variant QC, the per-sample transition-to-transversion 
ratio was comparable between all populations (mean ~3.25) (Supplementary 
 
Fig. 4). We still observed differences in total variant counts among the UK, 
Finnish and Swedish collections (Supplementary Fig. 3), likely reflecting differ-
ences in sequencing depth, capture reagents, sequencing protocol, read alignment 
and variant calling. However, variant counts and population genetics metrics were 
consistent between cases and controls within each population group.
We used the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) version 75 to anno-
tate all variants according to Gencode v.19 coding transcripts50. We grouped 
frameshift, stop gained, splice acceptor and donor variants as loss-of-function 
(LoF), and missense or initiator codon variants with a CADD Phred score ≥ 15 as 
 
damaging missense51.
Statistical significance and robustness of rare variant association analyses. 
Previous large sequencing analyses such as the Swedish schizophrenia, DDD 
and NHLBI myocardial infarction studies11,26,52 have defined genome-wide sig-
nificance for gene burden tests using a Bonferroni correction for the number of

genes and the number of functional and frequency cut-offs tested. For example, 
P < 1.25 × 10−6 is 0.05 corrected for 20,000 genes tested for nonsynonymous and 
LoF variants, and a further correction for two frequency thresholds would require 
the even more stringent cutoff of P < 6.25 × 10−7.
For these thresholds to control false positives, however, the test being used 
must produce well-calibrated P values. This has been shown to be true for stand-
ard approaches in a case-control setting, such as the basic burden test, Fisher’s 
exact test and the sequence kernel association test (SKAT)53, as long as the cases 
and controls are well-matched and residual differences are corrected for11,52. On 
the other hand, parent-proband trio studies use a Poisson or Binomial model 
parameterized by gene-specific mutation rates and the discovery sample size to 
test for an elevated rate of de novo mutations. While this approach is powerful, 
it is less robust than the approaches described above. First, de novo test statistics 
are highly sensitive to the specification of gene-specific mutation rates, which are 
well established for SNVs but not small indels. Furthermore, the low counts in 
 
de novo studies make results sensitive to the size of the discovery data set.
In previous studies of schizophrenia trios, thirty-eight genes had two or more 
de novo nonsynonymous mutations, two of which (SETD1A, P = 2.4 × 10−6 and 
TAF13, P = 1 ×10−6) were significant enough to be suggested as candidate schizo-
phrenia genes12,13. These two findings illustrate the challenges of interpreting 
 
de novo data in small numbers of samples. TAF13 has a coding length of 375 base 
pairs, making just two observations significant, though no additional evidence has 
been found in subsequent, much larger studies, including our own. For SETD1A, 
both mutations are indels, making it hard to accurately calculate Poisson P values 
(indeed, we have observed one of these de novo three additional times, suggesting 
it has a high mutation rate). Furthermore, this result is no longer significant when 
meta-analyzed with the published schizophrenia de novo data sets discussed in 
the same study17,19, which would be the statistically strongest analysis available 
at the time. Thus, in keeping with observations in other neurodevelopmental 
disorder sequencing studies, very large meta-analyses of both case-control and 
 
de novo variation from schizophrenia exomes are required to exclude many pos-
sible artifacts, rule other candidates in or out, and identify new risk genes.
case-control analysis. To identify genes with a significant burden of rare, 
damaging variants, we applied the basic burden test, Fisher’s exact test and the 
sequence kernel association test (SKAT) as implemented in PLINK/SEQ53,54. For 
each gene, we tested LoF variants and LoF combined with damaging missense 
variants. To evaluate significance, we performed 2 million case-control permuta-
tions within each population (UK, Finnish and Swedish) to control for ancestry 
and batch-specific differences. One-sided basic burden and Fisher’s exact tests 
were applied at three different minor allele frequency (MAF) thresholds (sin-
gletons, MAF ≤ 0.1% and MAF ≤ 0.5%). We used default parameters for SKAT 
 
(MAF ≤ 5%) and included the first ten principal components as covariates. 
Consistent with well-matched cases and controls, we observed no genome-wide 
inflation in either common or rare variant tests (Supplementary Fig. 7).
Gene set enrichment analyses broadly followed the methodology described 
in ref. 11 and implemented in PLINK/SEQ and the SMP utility. The gene set 
enrichment statistic was calculated as the sum of single gene burden test-statis-
tics corrected for exome-wide differences between cases and controls. Statistical 
significance was determined through permutation testing as described above. 
We adopted the min-P procedure to empirically correct for multiple testing: the 
same order of phenotypic permutations was applied for all tests, and a joint null 
distribution of minimal P values was generated to determine the significance of 
each gene set. The reported odds ratios and confidence intervals from the gene 
set enrichment analyses were calculated from raw counts without taking into 
account ancestry and batch-specific differences in cases and controls.
meta-analysis of de novo mutations and case-control burden. Validated 
 
de novo mutations identified in seven published studies of schizophrenia trios were 
aggregated for analysis with our case-control cohort (Supplementary Table 1). 
 
Recurrence of de novo mutations was modeled as the Poisson probability of 
observing N or more de novo variants in a gene given a baseline gene-specific 
mutation rate obtained from the method described in ref. 56 modified to produce 
LoF and damaging missense rates for each canonical Gencode v.19 gene55. The 
gene-specific mutation rates in our models have been validated as highly reliable in 
a previous publication56 and subsequently used in the main analyses of large-scale 
 
exome sequencing of neurodevelopmental disorders with highly replicable 
results15,26. A one-sided Fisher’s exact test was used to model the difference in rare 
LoF (MAF < 0.1%) burden between cases and controls. Subsequently, de novo and 
case-control burden P-values were meta-analyzed using Fisher’s combined prob-
ability method with df = 4 (Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9 and Supplementary 
Table 2). The odds ratios reported were corrected using penalized maximum 
likelihood logistic regression model (Firth’s method, implemented in the 
 
logistf R package).
We also applied the Transmission and Disequilibrium Association (TADA) 
method as described in ref. 22 and implemented in ref. 15. Information from 
the recurrence of de novo mutations was integrated with inherited and case-
control burden in a single statistical test. The robustness of results from TADA 
depends heavily on the specification of its hyperparameters, which are depend-
ent on the (unknown) genetic architecture of the trait. These include the rela-
tive risks for de novo and case-control variants (parameterized by γd and γ ) 
and the number of true risk genes in schizophrenia (k). Using estimates from 
the autism analysis would be incorrect; autism, for instance, has a greater 
excess of de novo LoF and missense mutations than schizophrenia (Fig. 3). 
 
To ensure any results from TADA are robust, we ran the model across a grid of 
reasonable parameters:

We used the default values for the remaining parameters and applied the 
 
following restrictions: γ

.
After exhaustively generating Bayes factor across a set of reasonable hyper-
parameters, the results largely agreed with the results obtained from the Fisher’s 
combined probability method: only one gene, SETD1A, had reached genome-
wide significance (Supplementary Fig. 8). We found that our signal in SETD1A 
had a q-value < 0.01 as long γd > 4, γ > 4 and k > 100. If we assumed a greater 
mean relative risk for LoF variants in SETD1A (γd > 8 and γ > 8) as expected for 
risk alleles in a constrained gene, SETD1A was exome-wide significant for any 
reasonable specification of k. We found that our signal in SETD1A is robust 
across frequentist and Bayesian models, under reasonable assumptions about 
schizophrenia’s genetic architecture (Supplementary Fig. 8). No other gene had a 
q-value <0.01 under any tested parameterization, including the parameterization 
used in the previous autism meta-analysis (Supplementary Table 5).
SETD1A loF variants in the exAc database. We looked in the ExAC database 
(v0.3) for the LoF variants in SETD1A. All exomes were joint-called using the 
GATK v3.2 pipeline, and included other public exome data sets, such as the 1000 
Genomes Project and NHLBI-GO Exome Sequencing Project, with additional 
quality control compared to their original releases. In 60,706 unrelated exomes, 
we observed seven LoF variants in SETD1A. Since the v0.3 release included the 
Swedish schizophrenia study, we excluded all samples from this data set, leav-
ing only four LoF variants in 45,376 exomes without a known neuropsychiatric 
diagnosis. We next applied the same stringent QC metrics we used in our analysis 
to ExAC data. We found that the 16:30976302-GC/G indel observed in two indi-
viduals was located at the same position as a high-quality SNP and occurred at a 
homopolymer run of cytosines. At the genotype level, both calls had a genotype 
quality (GQ) phred probability of < 40, far lower than used in our study in which 
we required indels to have a GQ > 90. In addition, the variant has poor allelic bal-
ance (AB < 0.15), and the BAM alignment reflected these low-quality metrics24. 
Given this evidence, we excluded the putative indel. Two high-quality SETD1A 
LoF variants in 45,376 unaffected ExAC exomes remained.
Following the approach in ref. 56, we determined the significance of the deple-
tion of SETD1A LoF variants in ExAC using a signed Z-score of the chi-squared 
deviation between observed and expected counts. We scaled the expected LoF 
counts provided by ExAC (43 in 60,706) to 45,376 exomes (expected value 
32.5), and calculated the one-tailed P-value of the signed Z-score assuming two

observed LoF variants. The degree of constraint relative to other coding genes 
was based on the pLI score24.
If we disregarded de novo status of our variants, our combined schizophrenia 
data set was composed of 7,776 cases and 13,028 controls. After including unaf-
fected ExAC exomes as additional controls, we observed ten LoF variants in 7,776 
cases and two LoF variants in 58,404 controls, which was significantly different 
by a Fisher’s exact test. This result was driven by ten very rare variants in our 
schizophrenia cases: six observed in only one individual each and the seventh 
observed in four individuals. Two of these four were de novo and the other two 
were found in unrelated individuals of different ancestry (one from Sweden and 
one from the UK). Similarly, of the two LoF variants in ExAC, one was observed 
in only one individual and the other was the recurrent indel in an individual of 
African ancestry. Thus, our burden test of very rare variants in SETD1A would not 
be confounded by systematic differences between subpopulations in the ExAC 
exomes and our data set.
Validation of SETD1A variants. We designed primers using Primer3 to produce 
products between 400 and 600 bp in length centered on the site of interest. Using 
genomic DNA from all trio members as templates, PCR reactions were carried 
out using Thermo-Start Taq DNA Polymerase (Thermo Scientific), following the 
manufacturer’s protocol, and successful PCR products were capillary sequenced. 
Traces from all trio members were aligned, viewed, and scored for the presence 
or absence of the variant.
Functional consequence of the exon 16 splice acceptor deletion. To assess the 
impact of the exon 16 splice acceptor site variant, we created a custom minigene 
construct. We cloned the entire 696-bp genomic region encompassing exons 15, 
16, 17 and intervening introns of human SETD1A, fused in-frame to a C-terminal 
GFP. The entire cassette was flanked by a strong upstream promoter and a down-
stream polyadenylation sequence. Plasmids containing either reference or dele-
tion-containing forms were transfected into HELA cells, which were then grown 
for 2 d under standard conditions. RNA was extracted (RNEasy, Qiagen) from 
the transfected cells and used to synthesize cDNA (SuperscriptIII, Invitrogen). 
We designed minigene-specific primers to avoid amplification of endogenous 
HELA derived transcripts. The first pair of primers spanned all three exons, 
thus allowing us to detect overall splicing changes (Pair 1, Forward 2: TCGAAG
AGTCATAAACACTGCCATG, Reverse 9: GTGAACAGCTCCTCGCCCTTG). 
We also designed pairs of exonic, intron-spanning primers to distinguish splic-
ing events upstream (Pair 2, Forward 1: TTTGCAGGATCCCATCGAAGAG
TC, exon 16 reverse: CACTGTCCATGATGGCGGAGGTA) and downstream 
(Pair 3, exon16 forward: CTGCTGAGCGCCATCGGTAC, exon17 reverse: 
CTGAACTTGTGGCCGTTTACGTC) of exon 16. PCRs were performed on 
cDNA from two transfection replicates of each sample. Agarose gels identified 
PCR product size differences (DNA ladder: 2-log ladder, New England BioLabs), 
which were further analyzed by capillary sequencing.
As expected, strong GFP expression was detected from the reference sequence 
construct. This suggested correct splicing between exons, leading to in-frame 
GFP translation. The mutant form displayed dramatically weaker GFP expres-
sion. mRNA was extracted from the transfected cells, and PCRs spanning all three 
exons revealed an increased transcript size in the mutant form compared to refer-
ence (Supplementary Fig. 11a). A PCR spanning just the first 2 exons (15/16) 
revealed a similar shift in size, suggesting that the splice site deletion/mutation 
was causing intron retention between exons 15 and 16 (Supplementary Fig. 11b). 
Sanger sequencing of the PCR products confirmed this aberrant splicing outcome 
(Supplementary Fig. 11c). The predicted translation product would therefore 
include translation of exon 15, the subsequent intron and out-of-frame transla-
tion of exon 16, resulting in a premature stop within this exon. The downstream 
splicing event to exon 17 was not affected. These data indicate that in human cells, 
the recurrent indel we observe in probands results in a premature stop codon and 
a truncated SETD1A protein.
De novo cnV deleting a single copy of SETD1A found in the ddd 
study. We observed a de novo CNV deleting 650 kilobases around SETD1A 
(chr16:30,964,376-31,614,891, Supplementary Fig. 12) in a DDD proband. 
CNV calling and quality control in the DDD study was described in a previ-
ous publication26, and the call was supported by signal from 156 probes. 
 
The proband had global developmental delay, absent speech, motor delay, sleep 
disturbance, developmental regression, feeding difficulties in infancy and gen-
eralized myoclonic seizures.
Phenotype clustering in ddd probands. Clinical geneticists systemati-
cally recorded phenotypes of DDD probands using the Human Phenotype 
Ontology (HPO)57. These terms were used to assess the probability that the 
probands shared more similar clinical phenotypes than expected by chance. 
Similarity testing used the Human Phenotype Ontology version 2013-11-
30. For each pair of terms we determined the information content (defined 
as the negative logarithm of the probability of the terms’ usage within the 
DDD cohort of 4,295 probands) for the most informative common ancestor. 
The similarity of HPO terms between two individuals was estimated as the 
maximum information content (maxIC) from pairwise comparisons of the 
HPO terms for the two individuals. The phenotype similarity for a set of N 
probands was estimated as the sum of all the pairwise maxIC scores. A null 
distribution of similarity scores was simulated from randomly sampled sets 
of N probands. The P-value was calculated as the proportion of scores greater 
than or equal to the observed score.
comparison of de novo mutation rates. This analysis aggregated and analyzed 
de novo mutations from four different studies: 1,113 probands with develop-
mental disorders26, 2,297 ASD probands15 and 566 control probands25,58. 
De novo mutations (xd) in each neurodevelopmental condition was modeled as 
 
xd ~ Pois(2NtµG), where Nt is the number of trios, µG is the genome-wide muta-
tion rate for a particular functional class and xd is the observed number of 
 
de novo mutations in Nt trios. The genome-wide mutation rate of each variant 
class was calculated as the sum of all gene-specific mutation rates in Samocha 
et al.56 (µsyn = 0.137, µdamaging mis = 0.165, µLoF = 0.043). We modeled de novo 
mutations in control trios to ensure that the genome-wide mutation rates were 
well calibrated. We report the probability of observing xd or more mutations in 
Nt trios given the genome-wide mutation rate. We used the Poisson exact test 
to determine if pairwise differences in de novo rates existed between control, 
SCZ, ASD and DD trios, and reported the two-sided P-values and rate ratios. 
Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for multiple testing.
Power calculations to show co-morbid cognitive impairment in schizophrenia 
SETD1A carriers. We estimated the sample size required to show that LoF variants 
in SETD1A specifically give rise to decreased cognitive function beyond their effect 
on schizophrenia risk. We assumed that pre-morbid IQ in individuals diagnosed 
with schizophrenia followed a Gaussian distribution with mean µ0 and s.d. σ. We 
further assumed that the distribution of pre-morbid IQ in carriers of SETD1A 
LoF variants was also Gaussian, shared the same s.d. σ, but has a shifted mean µ1. 
 
To calculate the sample size needed to show that µ0 and µ1 were statistically 
 
different, we performed power calculations using a one-sided t-test of means 
across a range of parameters for the effect size and frequency of SETD1A LoF 
variants. We define the following:

Assuming a modest effect on cognition (d = 0.5) and that only one in 10,000 
schizophrenia patients carries a SETD1A LoF variant, a sample size of over 
100,000 individuals would be required for 50% power to detect the effect. If the 
effect on cognition was greater (d = 1) and the true frequency was similar to the 
0.1% observed in our study, a sample size of over 10,000 individuals would have 
>50% power.
