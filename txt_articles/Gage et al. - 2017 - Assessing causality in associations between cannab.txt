Background. Observational associations between cannabis and schizophrenia are well documented, but ascertaining
causation is more challenging. We used Mendelian randomization (MR), utilizing publicly available data as a method
for ascertaining causation from observational data.
Method. We performed bi-directional two-sample MR using summary-level genome-wide data from the International
Cannabis Consortium (ICC) and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC2). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
associated with cannabis initiation (p < 10−5) and schizophrenia (p < 5 × 10−8) were combined using an inverse-variance-
weighted fixed-effects approach. We also used height and education genome-wide association study data, representing
negative and positive control analyses.
Results. There was some evidence consistent with a causal effect of cannabis initiation on risk of schizophrenia [odds
ratio (OR) 1.04 per doubling odds of cannabis initiation, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01–1.07, p = 0.019]. There was
strong evidence consistent with a causal effect of schizophrenia risk on likelihood of cannabis initiation (OR 1.10 per
doubling of the odds of schizophrenia, 95% CI 1.05–1.14, p = 2.64 × 10−5). Findings were as predicted for the negative con-
trol (height: OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99–1.01, p = 0.90) but weaker than predicted for the positive control (years in education:
OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.97–1.00, p = 0.066) analyses.
Conclusions. Our results provide some evidence that cannabis initiation increases the risk of schizophrenia, although
the size of the causal estimate is small. We find stronger evidence that schizophrenia risk predicts cannabis initiation,
possibly as genetic instruments for schizophrenia are stronger than for cannabis initiation.

Introduction
It is clear from human experimental studies that tetra-
hydrocannabinol (THC) intoxication can induce transi-
ent
psychotic
experiences
(D’Souza
et
al.
2004).
However, whether chronic cannabis use is causally
associated with psychotic disorders such as schizo-
phrenia is harder to ascertain (Gage et al. 2013,
2016a).
A
systematic
review
and
meta-analysis
(Moore et al. 2007) of longitudinal studies found evi-
dence for a modest association between cannabis and
later
psychotic
outcomes.
However,
the
authors
noted that the studies that adjusted for more potential
confounding factors found that the point estimates
attenuated to a greater degree than those adjusting
for fewer, indicating that residual confounding could
still be present. Some studies (Callaghan et al. 2012;
Rossler et al. 2012), although not all (Gage et al. 2014),
conducted since this meta-analysis have also found
evidence of an association between cannabis use and
later psychotic experiences or schizophrenia. As well
as these observational studies, studies have been
undertaken to investigate the genetic relationships
between cannabis and schizophrenia. Power et al.
(2014) found that a genetic risk score for schizophrenia
predicted cannabis use in a sample of 2082 healthy
individuals. Verweij et al. (in press) used linkage

 disequilibrium (LD) score regression to investigate this
association, and found evidence of a genetic correl-
ation between lifetime cannabis use and risk of schizo-
phrenia. This could be interpreted as shared genetic
aetiology, but could also reflect a causal association
between schizophrenia and risk of cannabis use
(Gage et al. 2015).
Observational epidemiology alone cannot allow
researchers to determine causality. Residual confound-
ing and reverse causation are difficult or impossible to
rule out, and associations that appear robust observa-
tionally are sometimes shown to be spurious when
experimentally
tested
(Davey
Smith
&
Ebrahim,
2001). A further difficulty in conducting observational
studies to investigate the association between cannabis
use and psychosis is that it is not possible to rule out
the impact of psychotic phenomena occurring during
intoxication in regular users due to the long half-life
of THC (Huestis et al. 1992). One technique that can
allow causal inference from observational data is
Mendelian randomization (MR). It has been described
in detail elsewhere (Davey Smith & Hemani, 2014;
Gage et al. 2016b); briefly, if genetic variants can be
identified that robustly predict an exposure of interest,
these can be used as unconfounded proxies for that
exposure. Associations between the variants and the
outcome of interest can thus provide evidence of caus-
ation while (subject to certain assumptions) eliminat-
ing problems of confounding or reverse causation. A
recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of can-
nabis initiation (Stringer et al. 2016) did not find any
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that reached
genome-wide significance, but identified a number of
SNPs with weaker evidence of association with canna-
bis initiation.
Two-sample MR allows for the use of publicly avail-
able summary data, where variant-exposure associations
are identified from one GWAS, and variant-outcome
associations from another (Burgess et al. 2015b). This
can provide the large sample sizes required to provide
adequate power to identify the small effect sizes of cau-
sal effects of common genetic variants in such studies.
The current study uses two-sample MR to assess the
likelihood of a causal association between cannabis
initiation and schizophrenia, and MR-Egger regression
(Bowden et al. 2015) to investigate whether any associ-
ation observed is due to pleiotropic effects of SNPs
rather than causal effects of cannabis on schizophrenia.
We also use two-sample MR with two other outcomes,
years in education and height, as positive and negative
controls, respectively. Evidence of association between
cannabis and a positive control (where causal effects
are more strongly established), and lack of evidence of
association with a negative control (where causal effects
are implausible) add support to causal interpretations.
We chose education as a positive control as previous epi-
demiological evidence has suggested a probable causal
association between cannabis and educational attain-
ment (Meier et al. 2012). We chose height as a negative
control outcome because cannabis is unlikely to have a
causal effect on height since cannabis use is not common
before mid- to late-adolescence (Eastwood, 2013).
Method
The International Cannabis Consortium (ICC) GWAS,
across the genome, explained 13–20% of the observed
phenotypic variation of ever use of cannabis (Stringer
et al. 2016). Although no genome-wide significant
SNPs were identified, 153 SNPs were associated with
cannabis initiation (ever/never use of cannabis) at p <
10−5. A number of these SNPs were in high linkage
disequilibrium. Where r2 > 0.9, one SNP was randomly
selected and the other highly correlated SNPs were
removed
from
the
analyses.
Twenty-two
SNPs
remained after this pruning, and a further SNP was
removed due to poor quality (Vink, 2016, personal
communication). The final 21 SNPs are listed in
Table 1. Correlations r2 < 0.9 were included in the ana-
lysis as a correlation matrix (Burgess et al. 2015b) (listed
in Supplementary Table S1).
These 21 SNPs were then extracted from the schizo-
phrenia
Psychiatric
Genetics
Consortium
(PGC2)
GWAS
(Schizophrenia
Working
Group
of
the
Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014), a GWAS of
educational attainment by the Social Science Genetics
Association Consortium (SSGAC; Rietveld et al. 2013)
and
the
Genetic
Investigation of
Anthropometric
Traits (GIANT; Wood et al. 2014) GWAS of height.
All 21 were in the schizophrenia GWAS, eight were
in the education GWAS, and nine were in the height
GWAS. We used the PhenoScanner tool (Staley et al.
2016)
(http://phenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac.uk)
to
identify proxy SNPs using r2 > 0.9 correlations calcu-
lated
in
European-descent
individuals
from 1000
Genomes Phase 3, and a further four were identified,
meaning
that
12
SNPs
were
available
for
the
cannabis-education and cannabis-height associations.
These SNPs were used for the main analyses for the
positive and negative controls. The full 21 SNPs were
used for the main analysis to investigate the associ-
ation between cannabis initiation and schizophrenia.
We also conducted a sensitivity analysis restricting
the cannabis-schizophrenia analysis to the same 12
SNPs used for the positive and negative control ana-
lyses. We used PhenoScanner to obtain estimates of
the mutual correlations between variants, and a correl-
ation matrix was included in the regression analysis
model
(Burgess
et
al.
2015a)
(correlation

shown in Supplementary Table S1).

 To assess the likelihood of a causal association
between schizophrenia and cannabis initiation (schizo-
phrenia risk predicting likelihood of cannabis initiation),
we extracted 128 SNPs independently associated with
schizophrenia
at
genome-wide
significance.
These
SNPs explain approximately 18% of the observed vari-
ance in schizophrenia risk (Schizophrenia Working
Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014).
Of the 128 SNPs, 107 were also present in the GWAS
of
cannabis
initiation
(listed
in
Supplementary
Table S2).
Effect of cannabis initiation on schizophrenia risk
Log odds ratios (ORs) and S.E. for the associations
between the significant (p < 10−5) SNPs and cannabis
initiation were recorded. The same SNPs were then
identified in the PGC2 GWAS of schizophrenia, and
the corresponding log ORs and S.E. were recorded.
The
SNP-exposure
and
SNP-outcome
coefficients
were combined using an inverse-variance-weighted
approach to give an overall estimate of causal effect.
This is equivalent to a weighted regression of the
SNP-outcome coefficients on the SNP-exposure coeffi-
cients with the intercept constrained to zero.
The results of the analyses were converted to ORs.
Given that schizophrenia is a binary outcome, the
resulting causal effect estimate represents the odds
for schizophrenia risk per unit increase in the log OR
for cannabis initiation, and is therefore somewhat
hard to interpret. ORs have therefore been converted
(by multiplying log ORs by 0.693 and then exponenti-
ating) in order to represent the OR per doubling in
odds of the binary exposure.
Effect of schizophrenia risk on cannabis initiation
As above, the 107 SNPs associated with schizophrenia
were extracted from the GWAS schizophrenia, and
then identified in the GWAS of cannabis initiation,
and log ORs and
S.E. recorded. The SNP-exposure
and
SNP-outcome
coefficients
were
combined
as
described above.
Positive and negative controls
The 12 cannabis initiation SNPs (or proxies where
appropriate) were identified in GWAS of education
and height, and β coefficients and S.E. recorded, as
described above. Although these GWASs were con-
ducted on continuous outcomes, the resulting coeffi-
cients have been transformed as described above
(multiplied by 0.693) for consistency.

 Sensitivity analyses
We used MR-Egger regression to formally test for
potential violations of MR assumptions. This method
relaxes the assumption that the effects of genetic var-
iants on the outcome operate entirely via the exposure,
by allowing an intercept term in the weighted regres-
sion described above. The intercept parameter repre-
sents the overall pleiotropic effect of the SNPs on the
outcome (i.e. a direct effect on the outcome rather
than via the exposure, which would violate MR
assumptions). If the intercept deviates from the null,
this provides evidence that there may be bias in the
standard causal estimate due to pleiotropy. The β
coefficient for this analysis provides a causal estimate,
assuming that the pleiotropic effect of SNPs on the out-
come is not correlated with the associations between
the SNPs and the exposure (MR-Egger is described in
more detail in Corbin et al. 2016).
With
correlated
genetic
variants,
the
inverse-
variance-weighted regression model is extended to a
generalized weighted regression model, as described
previously (Burgess et al. 2015a). For MR-Egger regres-
sion, the same generalized weighted regression ana-
lysis was undertaken except including an intercept
term in the regression model. The genetic associations
with the outcome (ˆ
βY) were regressed on the genetic
associations with the exposure (cannabis initiation, ˆ
βX)
using inverse-variance weights. The regression model is:
ˆ
βY = θ0 + θEˆ
βX + ε,
where θ0 is the intercept term and θE is the Egger causal
estimate and ε is an error term with zero mean and
covariance matrix Ω. The weighting matrix Ω has
terms Ωj1j2 = σYj1σYj2ρj1j2, where σYj is the S.E. of the gen-
etic association with the outcome for the jth SNP, and
ρj1j2 is the correlation between the j1th and j2th SNPs.
This regression gives the same estimates as standard
MR-Egger regression with uncorrelated variants when
the correlations between different variants are all zero.
As
another
sensitivity
analysis,
the
cannabis-
schizophrenia association was also assessed using the
12 SNPs available for the education and height ana-
lyses, in order to allow a direct comparison. Given
the potentially weak instruments used to predict can-
nabis initiation, we ran a further sensitivity analysis
where we systematically removed each SNP from the
analysis, in order to check the robustness of the
findings.
Finally, we performed a calculation in order to esti-
mate the relative risk of schizophrenia predicted by
our upper confidence bound (UCB) comparing an indi-
vidual who is likely to use cannabis (50% probability of
initiation) with an individual with a low probability of
smoking cannabis (10% probability of initiation) using
the calculation: exp((log(0.5/(1–0.5)) – log(0.1/(1 – 0.1))
*log(UCB/0.693).
Results
Effect of cannabis initiation on schizophrenia risk
In 36 989 schizophrenia cases and 113 075 controls, an
MR analysis using 21 SNPs associated (p < 10−5) with
cannabis initiation indicated a small association with
schizophrenia case status [OR 1.04, 95% confidence
interval (CI) 1.01–1.07 per doubling of the odds of ini-
tiation, p = 0.019].
Effect of schizophrenia risk on cannabis initiation
In 14 388 individuals who have used cannabis in their
lifetime and 17 942 non-cannabis users, an MR analysis
using 107 SNPs associated with schizophrenia at
genome-wide
significance
(p < 5 × 10−8)
provided
strong evidence of an association between schizophre-
nia case status and lifetime cannabis initiation (OR
1.10, 95% CI 1.05–1.14 per doubling of the odds of
schizophrenia, p = 2.64 × 10−5).
Positive and negative controls
In 126 599 individuals, an MR analysis using 12 SNPs
associated (p < 10−5) with cannabis initiation indicated
a weak association with fewer years in education (OR
0.99, 95% CI 0.97–1.00 per doubling of the odds of ini-
tiation, p = 0.066) (the positive control). In 253 288 indi-
viduals, an MR analysis using these SNPs found no
evidence of an association with height (OR 1.00, 95%
CI 0.99–1.01, p = 0.90) (the negative control). These
results are shown in Table 2.
Sensitivity analyses
A sensitivity MR-Egger regression indicated very little
evidence of pleiotropy in the association between can-
nabis and schizophrenia using the full list of 21 SNPs
(intercept: OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98–1.01, p = 0.50). The
strength of evidence for a causal association was con-
siderably weaker in this analysis with wider CIs (OR
1.01, 95% CI 0.93–1.10, p = 0.815), although not incon-
sistent with the findings from the primary analysis.
There was no strong evidence of pleiotropy in the
association between schizophrenia (exposure) and can-
nabis initiation (outcome) (intercept: OR 1.00, 95% CI
0.98–1.01, p = 0.52). The point estimate was larger in
this
analysis
as
compared
to
the
standard
MR
approach, however the strength of evidence of an asso-
ciation was weaker (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.96–1.43, p =
0.13). The Egger plots for these analyses are shown in
Supplementary Figs S1 and S2.

 MR-Egger regression suggested weak evidence of
pleiotropy in the positive and negative control out-
come analyses using 12 SNPs (intercept OR education:
0.99, 95% CI 0.97–1.00, p = 0.18; height: 0.99, 95% CI
0.98–1.00, p = 0.093). The causal estimate from the
MR-Egger regression for the association of cannabis
initiation with years of education was slightly larger
than for the main analysis, although the strength of
evidence was very similar (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88–
1.00,
p = 0.062).
The
causal
estimate
from
the
MR-Egger regression analysis of cannabis initiation
and height provided weak evidence for cannabis initi-
ation being associated with shorter height (OR 0.95,
95% CI 0.88–1.01, p = 0.095), but was still consistent
overall with the lack of association indicated in the pri-
mary analysis. These results are shown in Table 3.
When the association between cannabis initiation
and schizophrenia risk was restricted to the 12 SNPs
available for the education and height analyses, the
resulting association was similar to the primary ana-
lysis, although CIs were wider (OR 1.03, 95% CI
0.99–1.08, p = 0.15). This is shown in Tables 2 and 3.
When we systematically removed each SNP that pre-
dicted cannabis initiation in turn there was no evidence
that the size of the effect was being driven by one SNP
(Supplementary Fig. S3).
Finally, we calculated the relative risk of schizophre-
nia for an individual who is likely to smoke cannabis
(50% probability of initiation) to be at most 24% higher
compared with an individual with a low probability of
smoking cannabis (10% probability of initiation) based
on the upper CI for the causal effect estimate.
Discussion
Our results provide some evidence in support of the
hypothesis that cannabis initiation increases the risk
of schizophrenia, although the size of the causal

effect sizes generally seen in the observational data
(Moore et al. 2007) particularly when considering can-
nabis initiation phenotypes, and in these results using
a different methodology, this converging evidence
supports the theory that although cannabis use might
be a risk factor for schizophrenia, any effect cannabis
initiation has is likely to be small. For example, based
on the upper bound of the 95% CI from our primary
analysis, an individual who is more likely to smoke
cannabis (50% probability of initiation) has at most a
24% higher relative risk of suffering from schizophre-
nia compared with an individual with a low probabil-
ity of smoking cannabis (10% probability of initiation).
However, these results are unlikely to be directly com-
parable to the observational studies in terms of com-
paring effect sizes, particularly with regard to heavier
use of cannabis, or use of different strains of cannabis
where ratios of cannabinoids may differ. The ratio of
THC and cannabidiol (CBD) is likely to be particularly
important in determining the psychotomimetic proper-
ties of cannabis (D’Souza et al. 2004; Iseger & Bossong,
2015), although genetic variants that index the strength
of cannabis used have not been identified as yet.
We found strong evidence in support of the reverse
causation hypothesis, that schizophrenia risk predicts
likelihood of cannabis initiation. These findings are
consistent with a recent study that showed genetic pre-
disposition for schizophrenia was associated with
increased use of cannabis (Power et al. 2014). The
authors of that study interpreted their findings as evi-
dence for shared genetic aetiology between cannabis
use and schizophrenia; however, an alternate interpret-
ation, supported by the more directional analyses
reported here, is that schizophrenia risk increases the
risk of cannabis use. Our study cannot provide infor-
mation about potential mechanisms through which
this could happen. Causation could be via either bio-
logical or social mechanisms. For example, people
with a higher genetic risk for schizophrenia could be
more predisposed to try cannabis because they experi-
ence more pleasurable or positive effects of intoxica-
tion, or because they are more likely to associate with
people who use cannabis (Nordsletten et al. 2016).
However,
these
explanations
remain
speculative,
although could be tested in further research, for
example
using
a
recall-by-genotype
design.
The
findings from the positive and negative control ana-
lyses were broadly consistent with our prediction;
our results suggest that cannabis initiation is associated
with fewer years in education (although with weaker
evidence than predicted), while cannabis initiation
does not predict height.
Strengths and limitations
MR studies allow stronger evidence of causality than is
possible from observational epidemiology, which is a
strength of this study. Utilizing both MR and positive
and negative control designs allows for a triangulation
of approaches with different limitations (Gage et al.
2016b). A particular strength of two-sample MR is
that it can provide the large sample sizes required to
identify the small effect sizes that are likely when
using SNPs as proxies to study complex phenotypes.
However, there are a number of limitations to our
study. First, none of the SNPs used to predict cannabis
initiation reached genome-wide significance in the ori-
ginal GWAS (Stringer et al. 2016). As these SNPs are
not strong predictors of cannabis initiation (and some
may represent false positives), it is likely that our effect
size estimates will be overly conservative. The weak
evidence of association with our positive control
could be explained by the weakness of our genetic
instrument. While these SNPs did not reach genome-
wide significance in the cannabis initiation GWAS,
they were nevertheless associated with initiation at
p < 10−5. Inferences and estimates from MR analyses
may still be valid even if genetic variants are included
that are not truly associated with the exposure; their
inclusion is equivalent to adding noise to a genetic
risk score. Including false positive variants is not
ideal as it reduces power and could introduce pleio-
tropic variants to the analysis. However, as we do
not know which variants are true associations and
which are false positives, our approach makes the
best possible use of the available data. We also conduct
MR-Egger sensitivity analyses, which are more robust
to pleiotropy.
Secondly, there is a small overlap in the cohorts
included in the schizophrenia and cannabis GWAS,
as both include data from the Estonia Genome
Centre cohort (EGCUT). ECGUT data makes up 2.3%
of the PGC2 dataset, and approximately 10% of the
Cannabis Consortium dataset. The true overlap is
1500 individuals (T. Esko, 2016, personal communica-
tion). A small overlap such as this is unlikely to result
in substantial bias (Burgess et al. 2016). Large overlap
would bias the results in the direction of the observa-
tional association (and therefore could lead to an over-
estimation of the effect). We reran our main analyses in
both directions using a version of the PGC2 data with
this sample removed. Results did not change from
those presented.
Thirdly, and perhaps more problematic, is that it is
not clear what the cannabis initiation phenotype used

 in the Cannabis Consortium GWAS actually repre-
sents; participants were asked ‘Have you ever used
cannabis?’, so there is no distinction between having
tried cannabis once and having used it every day for
many years. If there is a causal association between
cannabis and schizophrenia, it is more likely that
exposure intensity would be the relevant risk factor.
Observationally, the association between ever use of
cannabis and later psychosis is much weaker than for
heavy cannabis use (Moore et al. 2007). Furthermore,
those who choose to try cannabis (rather than become
regular or heavy users) might be more impulsive or
risk taking than those who never try it, and this
GWAS could therefore be a measure of that or other
related phenotypes, rather than cannabis initiation per
se. Our lack of understanding of the function of the
genetic variants identified in the cannabis initiation
GWAS and their role in cannabis metabolism means
that we do not understand the mechanism by which
they impact on cannabis use.
A recent GWAS of cannabis use identified three
SNPs at genome-wide significance in a sample of 14
754 participants (Sherva et al. 2016). However, this
GWAS conflates cannabis initiation with dependence
phenotypes, which would make interpretation of any
association we might find challenging. Moreover,
given our inability to stratify participants in the schizo-
phrenia PGC sample by cannabis use status, we
deemed it inappropriate to use these SNPs as genetic
influences
on
cannabis
dependence
cannot
occur
unless a person has used cannabis. This analysis
needs to be conducted in cannabis users separately
from non-users; if the association between cannabis
and schizophrenia is causal, there should be an associ-
ation observed between the cannabis dependence
SNPs and schizophrenia in cannabis dependent sub-
jects, but no association observed in non-users.
A further limitation relates to the nature of schizo-
phrenia. Since most of the population do not have
schizophrenia, we are making an assumption that gen-
etic predictors of schizophrenia also have an impact in
the general population. There is evidence that psych-
otic symptoms exist on a continuum (Linscott & van
Os, 2013), which would mean this is an appropriate
assumption to make. It has also been found that gen-
etic risk for schizophrenia predicts childhood psycho-
pathology (Jones et al. 2016).
Finally, a further limitation is our choice of positive
and negative controls. While weak evidence of associ-
ation may be due to the use of a weak genetic instru-
ment, as discussed above, it is also possible that our
assumption of causality between cannabis and educa-
tion is misplaced. Since we began our analyses, two
studies have been published suggesting that the associ-
ation between cannabis and education may be more
strongly
confounded
than
previously
believed
(Jackson et al. 2016; Mokrysz et al. 2016). With regards
to height as a negative control, there is some evidence
of a negative correlation between height and schizo-
phrenia risk that could be due to pleiotropy (Bacanu
et al. 2013). Identifying appropriate positive and nega-
tive controls is extremely challenging when investigat-
ing complex phenotypes such as substance use and
mental health. However, in the interests of complete-
ness we present both our positive and negative control
analyses as originally conceived.
Given that schizophrenia and cannabis initiation are
both complex phenotypes, likely to be influenced by
multiple genetic and environmental risk factors, a con-
sideration of pleiotropy is important. We conducted
MR-Egger analyses to formally test for biological plei-
otropy (where genetic variants have a direct impact on
more than one phenotype). Biological pleiotropy vio-
lates the assumptions of MR, but we find only weak
evidence of biological pleiotropy. It is distinct from
mediated pleiotropy (whereby a genetic variant may
have a mediated impact on a later phenotype via a dir-
ect effect on an upstream phenotype), which does not
violate the assumptions of MR. A recent paper
(Verweij et al. in press) used LD score regression to
assess the association between cannabis use and
schizophrenia, and found evidence of a genetic correl-
ation. This could mean shared genetic architecture, but
it is also consistent with a causal relationship in one or
both directions.
Conclusion
Our results provide some evidence that cannabis initi-
ation might be causally associated with odds of devel-
oping schizophrenia, using two-sample MR to support
stronger causal inference, although the size of the asso-
ciation is small. The results provide stronger evidence
that schizophrenia risk predicts likelihood of cannabis
initiation, but the weakness of the currently available
genetic instrument for cannabis use limits our inter-
pretation of these results. While stronger instruments
are likely to be identified with increasing GWAS sam-
ple sizes, future GWAS studies of schizophrenia
should prioritise recording cumulative cannabis expos-
ure in cases and controls to allow the causal association
between heaviness of cannabis use and schizophrenia
to be investigated in stratified samples.
