Abstract
Background: The Germanwings Flight 9525 crash has brought the sensitive subject of airline pilot mental health to
the forefront in aviation. Globally, 350 million people suffer from depression–a common mental disorder. This study
provides further information on this important topic regarding mental health especially among female airline pilots.
This is the first study to describe airline pilot mental health–with a focus on depression and suicidal thoughts–outside
of the information derived from aircraft accident investigations, regulated health examinations, or identifiable
self-reports, which are records protected by civil aviation authorities and airline companies.
Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study via an anonymous web-based survey administered between
April and December 2015. Pilots were recruited from unions, airline companies, and airports via convenience
sampling. Data analysis included calculating absolute number and prevalence of health characteristics and
depression scores.
Results: One thousand eight hundred thirty seven (52.7%) of the 3485 surveyed pilots completed the survey,
with 1866 (53.5%) completing at least half of the survey. 233 (12.6%) of 1848 airline pilots responding to the
Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), and 193 (13.5%) of 1430 pilots who reported working as an airline pilot in
the last seven days at time of survey, met depression threshold–PHQ-9 total score ≥ 10. Seventy-five participants (4.1%)
reported having suicidal thoughts within the past two weeks. We found a significant trend in proportions of depression
at higher levels of use of sleep-aid medication (trend test z = 6.74, p < 0.001) and among those experiencing sexual
harassment (z = 3.18, p = 0.001) or verbal harassment (z = 6.13, p < 0.001).
Conclusion: Hundreds of pilots currently flying are managing depressive symptoms perhaps without the possibility of
treatment due to the fear of negative career impacts. This study found 233 (12.6%) airline pilots meeting depression
threshold and 75 (4.1%) pilots reporting having suicidal thoughts. Although results have limited generalizability, there
are a significant number of active pilots suffering from depressive symptoms. We recommend airline organizations
increase support for preventative mental health treatment. Future research will evaluate additional risk factors of
depression such as sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances.

 Background
On March 24, 2015, Germanwings flight 4U 9525 crashed
into the French Alps killing 150 people. Investigators of
this tragic event report the 27-year-old co-pilot deliber-
ately crashed the plane [1, 2]. Further examination of the
co-pilot’s history found evidence suggesting the co-pilot
suffered from clinical depression [3]. Previous suicide at-
tempts and having a history of mental disorders, particu-
larly clinical depression, are risk factors of suicide [4].
Clinical depression, also referred to as major depressive
disorder (MDD) – characterized by at least two weeks of
depressed mood or loss of interest along with at least four
additional symptoms of depression [5] – is the second
leading cause of years of life lived with a disability (YLDs)
[6] and third most important cause of disease burden
worldwide and affects an estimated 350 million people
[7, 8]. The United States (U.S.) leads the world in the
percent of people (21%) who will have a mood disorder,
including MDD, over their lifetime [9]. In the U.S.,
more females report having depression than males [8],
17% of people will have MDD over their lifetime [10], and
7% will have experienced an MDD in the past year [11].
MDD symptoms cause significant distress and social,
occupational, and life activity impairment and may first
appear at any age with most new cases occurring around
20 years of age in the U.S [5, 12]. Estimates of prevalence
of diagnosed MDD or depressive symptoms related to
MDD among high stress occupations include 12% among
deployed and 13% among previously deployed U.S. mili-
tary personnel [13], 7% among U.S. emergency medical
technicians [14], and 10–17% among U.S. police officers
[15].
There are an estimated 140,000 airline pilots inter-
nationally with about 70,000 in the U.S [16]. The ma-
jority of pilots are male: just over 4% of all pilots are
female [17]. In the U.S., the Department of Transportation,
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) sets requirements
for aeromedical examiners (AMEs) to evaluate fitness of
pilots. Only through self-disclosure are mental disorders
discussed and noted in pilot health records; AMEs do not
diagnose mental health conditions (See Additional file 1
for more details). Underreporting of mental health symp-
toms and diagnoses is probable among airline pilots due
to the public stigma of mental illness and fear among pi-
lots of being “grounded” or not fit for duty [18, 19].
Studies of airline pilots have either not anonym-
ously assessed mental health or had limitations in
doing so. Prior studies have found a lower prevalence
of depression among military pilots [19] and airline
pilots [18, 20] compared to the general population.
However, there is concern about underreporting of ad-
verse health symptoms and incomplete medical informa-
tion due to pilots protecting professional interests [18],
and underreporting of the use of antidepressants in
aeromedical examinations has been found among a group
of U.S. civilian pilots involved in fatal accidents [21]. An-
onymous surveying could alleviate some of the issues with
underreporting. Only one study of airline pilots has used
anonymous reporting, but it did not specifically evaluate
depression nor suicidal thoughts [18].
The objective of our study was to provide a more ac-
curate description of mental health among commercial
airline pilots underscoring symptoms related to clinical
depression (hereafter also referred to as “depression”)
using an anonymous survey to guard against fears of
stigma and job discrimination. This study did not con-
duct clinical interviews of survey respondents to confirm
diagnosis of depression, nor did it have access to medical
records. This is the first study that we are aware of to
describe mental health in a convenience sample of pilots
outside of the information derived from aircraft accident
investigations [22] or regulated health examinations, which
are identifiable self-reports and physician interviews, and
are records protected by civil aviation authorities and airline
companies.
Methods
Study design
This is a cross-sectional descriptive study of commercial
airline pilots who completed a web-based survey between
April and December 2015. In order to protect pilots’ abil-
ity to hold an FAA Medical Certificate the survey was
completely anonymous and no internet protocol (IP) ad-
dresses were collected. The Institutional Review Board of
the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health reviewed
and exempted the study.
Recruitment
methods
included
targeted
e-mail,
newsletters, word-of-mouth, handing postcards to pi-
lots, and aviation publication advertisements. Airline
pilot populations that gave rise to the survey popula-
tion included pilot unions (>5 unions), airline repre-
sentatives (>65 airlines), pilot groups (>12 groups),
and aviation safety organizations (>2 organizations).
We targeted female pilots in recruiting because of the
small percentage of female pilots among the general
airline pilot population. We downloaded 3485 surveys
on December 31, 2015.
The data analysis included all answered questions. We
defined a completed survey as answering the final non-
optional question. We assumed each participant was a
pilot and only completed one survey. Several questions in
the survey require knowledge that would only be readily
available to pilots. An active pilot (co-author DDM)
reviewed surveys for potential non-pilot participants.
All surveys passed this screening. Finally, the survey
instructed participants to leave the checkbox unmarked
if they did not have a diagnosis of the listed disorder.

 Survey description
The survey utilized standardized questions from the Job
Content Questionnaire [23] and the Centers for Disease
Control – National Center for Health Statistics (CDC-
NCHS) National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES) (CDC-NCHS 2011–2012) [24], which
previous researchers applied to evaluate U.S. flight at-
tendant health [25]. Participants were not likely to be
biased to mental health outcomes since the survey
covered other work and health topics. The survey took
about 30 min for completion. We utilized Qualtrics
software (Qualtrics, Provo, Utah) to disseminate surveys
and collect responses.
Statistical analysis
We utilized STATA software (Version 13.1, StataCorp,
College Station, Texas) for data analysis. We applied
two-sided unequal variances t-test for continuous vari-
ables, Pearson’s chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test
(n ≤ 5) for categorical variables, and nonparametric
test for trend across ordered groups. Age was catego-
rized into four groups using quartiles. We utilized the
Kruskal-Wallis equality-of-populations rank test to com-
pare scores among age categories. Significance was defined
as p-value <0.05.
Outcome assessment
We evaluated depressive symptoms via the Patient Health
Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression module utilized in pre-
vious NHANES surveys (e.g., NHANES 2005–2006 and
2011–2012), which is well validated and used in clinical
studies assessing depression [26, 27]. Briefly, the PHQ-9
depression module asks nine questions, which are the nine
criteria for diagnosing depressive disorder in the Diagnos-
tic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Edition 4
(DSM-IV) [26]. Researchers record scores as frequency of
depression symptoms over the past two weeks [26]. Re-
sponse categories include “not at all,” “several days,” “more
than half the days” and “nearly every day” and given a
score ranging from 0 to 3, respectively. Total summed
scores per participant range from 0 to 27. Studies evaluat-
ing validity of PHQ-9 report a total score of 10 or greater
had an 88% sensitivity and 88% specificity for depression
[26] with a kappa of 0.56 to 0.74 between PHQ-9 diagno-
sis and diagnosis by an independent mental health profes-
sional [28, 29]. Therefore, we refer to meeting the cut-off
of having a PHQ-9 total score of 10 as depression.
Results
Of the 3485 participants, 1837 (52.7%) completed the
survey and 1866 (53.5%) answered at least half of the
survey. Completers initiated surveys from over 50 coun-
tries. Major locations included the United States (1586,
45.5%), Canada (438, 12.6%), and Australia (387, 11.1%).
Participants initiated surveys in Europe (406, 11.7%),
Asia (413, 11.9%), South America (165, 4.7%), and South
Africa (8, 0.2%). Locations with the most participants in
Europe were Spain (134, 3.9%), United Kingdom (65,
1.9%), and Germany (32, 0.9%). For Asia the locations
were United Arab Emirates (172, 4.9%), Hong Kong
(147, 4.2%), and Thailand (13, 0.4%). For South America
the locations were Colombia (74, 2.1%), Brazil (71, 2.0%),
and Chile (8, 0.23%). Due to many missing responses
among non-completers, comparisons between completers
and non-completers were constrained to average tenure as
a pilot (completers 18.0 years, 95% CI 17.5 to 18.4 vs. non-
completers 16.9, 16.2 to 17.6, p = 0.012) and the propor-
tion working one trip as an airline pilot in the past 30 days
(completers 1417, 77.1% vs. non-completers 1099, 73.0%,
p = 0.006). The response rate [30] among those who an-
swered at least one question was 0.68. Of the 1826 who
provided age, about half were middle aged with the me-
dian age for females and males at 42 (IQR 36–51) and 50
(IQR 41–60) years, respectively. Half of participants
worked at least 16 years as a pilot and nearly four out of
five worked one trip as an airline pilot in the past 30 days.
The majority of respondents were non-smokers, married,
and white. Over 60% earned a four-year college degree or
had graduate education (Table 1).
Nearly all ages up to 80 years had pilots who met
depression threshold–PHQ-9 total score ≥ 10 (Fig. 1).
Among age categories, median total depression score
decreased with increasing age quartile (Kruskal-Wallis rank
test chi-square with ties = 157.63 with 3 d.f., p < 0.001)
(Fig. 2). The number of pilots self-reporting having at least
one day of poor mental health during the past month
ranged from 94 (26.9%) among those over age 60 to 273
(56.5%) among 41 to 50 years (Table 2). Forty-seven (9.6%)
respondents up to age 40 and 110 (11.9%) age 41 to 60 years
reported having at least eight days of poor mental health
during the past month (Table 2). Females had a greater pro-
portion of having at least one day of poor mental health
during the past month (females 139, 55.2% vs. males 697,
45.6%, p = 0.005) or having ever been diagnosed with de-
pression (females 12, 4.7% vs. males 46, 2.9%, p = 0.12).
Median PHQ-9 total scores was lowest among those
over 60 (Table 3) and were the same among sex with
males (3, IQR(1–7), n = 1591) having a greater spread of
total scores than females (3, (2–6), n = 255). The greatest
differences in proportions between females and males
experiencing at least one day of problems were among
PHQ-9 items #1: Having little interest or pleasure in
doing things (females 87, 34.1% vs. males 683, 43.1%,
p = 0.007) and #5: Having poor appetite or overeating
(140, 55.1% vs. 687, 43.5%, p = 0.001).
Among participants who answered the PHQ-9 ques-
tions, 233 (12.6%) met threshold associated with clinical
levels of depression. Two-hundred-and-four (12.8%) males

Page 3 of 12
 and 29 (11.4%) females (χ2 p = 0.52) met depression
threshold. One-hundred and ninety-two (13.6%) of the
1413 pilots who reported working as an airline pilot in the
last 30 days met depression threshold (Table 4).
Among screening questions concerning psychological
symptoms (PHQ-9 questions 1,2,6,7,9), a greater propor-
tion of males than females reported “nearly every day”
experiences in loss of interest (males 59, 3.7% vs. females
2, 0.8%, p = 0.01), feeling depressed (27, 1.7% vs. 4, 1.6%,
p = 1.00), feeling like a failure (34, 2.2% vs. 3, 1.2%, p =
0.47), trouble concentrating (34, 2.2% vs. 5, 2.0%, p = 1.00),
and thinking they would be better off dead or having
thoughts of self-harm (10, 0.6% vs. 0, 0.0%, p = 0.37).
Seventy-five participants (4.1%) reported having thoughts
of being better off dead or self-harm within the past two
weeks (pilots working within the past month 49, 3.5% vs.
not 26, 6.4%, p = 0.008). A higher percentage of males (23,
1.5%) vs. females (1, 0.4%, p= 0.24) felt that the problems
they reported on the PHQ-9 made it very or extremely dif-
ficult for them to work, take care of home matters, or en-
gage in healthy relationships with people.
Among those who answered the PHQ-9 questions and
indicated their location of initiating the survey, 232
(12.6%) met threshold associated with clinical levels of
depression. We stratified location of survey initiation
into countries exhibiting more western cultural influence
(i.e., countries in North and South America, Europe, or
Australia) and those exhibiting less (i.e., countries in Asia).
There were 1576 (85.5%) participants initiating surveys in
more culturally western countries and 267 (14.5%) in less

 culturally western countries. Countries with more western
cultural influence had a lower percentage of pilots meeting
depression threshold than others (172, 10.9% vs. 60,
22.5%, p < 0.001). Examining this further by sex reveals the
prevalence of meeting threshold is similar among females
(more western 27, 11.3% vs. less 2, 13.3%, p = 0.68). This
was not the case among males with more western having
a prevalence lower than less western (145, 10.9% vs. 58,
23.0%, p < 0.001). Furthermore, 61 participants (3.9%)
initiating surveys in more culturally western countries
compared to 14 (5.3%)
in less
western countries
reported having thoughts of being better off dead or
self-harm within the past two weeks. This difference
was not statistically significant (p = 0.31). Grouped by
sex, there was no significant difference among females
(more western 7, 2.9% vs. less 0, 0.0%, p = 1.00) or males
(more western 54, 4.1% vs. less 14, 5.6%, p = 0.31).
The proportion meeting depression threshold among
pilots working in the past month was higher as the fre-
quency of taking sleep aid medicines in the past month
increased (Table 5). The survey found 19 (16.2%) working
pilots met depression threshold among those consuming

 more than one drink of alcohol per day. The proportion of
pilots meeting the same threshold was higher among those
experiencing sexual harassment (36.4% among those ex-
periencing harassment 4 or more times in the past week)
or verbal harassment (42.9% among those experiencing
harassment 4 or more times in the past week) in the last
12 months at work.
Discussion
The Germanwings crash in March of 2015 has brought a
sensitive subject to the forefront in aviation; pilot mental
health. To date, this is the first study providing a de-
scription from anonymous reporting of mental health
among commercial airline pilots with an emphasis on
depression and suicidal thoughts. Our study also over-
sampled female pilots (13.7% of our study population) to
better describe this minority population (about 4%)
among commercial airline pilots [17]. We utilized an an-
onymous web-based survey to collect responses and a
clinically validated questionnaire, PHQ-9, to determine
depression (PHQ-9 total score ≥ 10).
In the context of reporting depression, female pilots
reported more days with poor mental health and hav-
ing
more
diagnosed
depression
than
male
pilots,
which mirrors reporting among the general popula-
tion. The prevalence of depression (12.6%) among pi-
lots from our study is much higher than some studies
utilizing identifiable surveys and medical records [19,
20] and possibly lower than another study [31]. One
study utilizing anonymous case reporting among com-
mercial airline pilots between years 1996 and 1999
found the prevalence of psychiatric disease around
7.5% [18]. However, this study did not report informa-
tion on depression or suicidal thoughts and its authors
acknowledged the inability to identify an exact refer-
ence population [18]. In addition, a study utilizing the
medical record database of U.S. Air Force pilots esti-
mated a prevalence of depression of 0.06% during years
2001–2006 [19]. Researchers evaluating airline pilots in
the New Zealand Health Survey found a prevalence of
depression of 1.9% during years 2009–2010 [20]. A re-
port on Air Canada pilots with long term disability
found a prevalence of mental disorders at 15.8% [31].
These studies did not evaluate prevalence of pilots hav-
ing suicidal thoughts. Furthermore, estimates of preva-
lence of depression or depressive symptoms among
other high stress occupations include 12% among de-
ployed and 13% among previously deployed U.S. mili-
tary personnel [13], 7% among U.S. emergency medical
technicians [14], and 10–17% among U.S. police officers
[15]. From these studies of mental illness in pilots and
similar high stress occupations, the prevalence of depres-
sion in our results seem probable. Moreover, the higher
prevalence of depression among victims of frequent sexual
or verbal harassment in our study provides further evi-
dence of its existence among airline pilots, deep negative
effects on its victims, and the urgent need to eliminate this
form of harassment and help this subpopulation of
workers.
Our study found 75 pilots (4.1%) reported having
thoughts of being better off dead or self-harm within the
past two weeks. To our knowledge, this is the most current
measure of the prevalence of suicidal thoughts among air-
line pilots. One study estimated an aircraft assisted suicide
rate of 0.33% over a 20 year period in the U.S. following
analysis of aircraft accidents from 1956 to 2012 [32].
However, this study measured completed suicides, not
prevalence of suicidal thoughts.

 We hypothesize two possible explanations for the lower
prevalence of meeting depression threshold in pilots who
initiated the survey in more western culture countries
compared to others. One reason is the type of culture the
pilots identify themselves with and country of survey
initiation is not an accurate match. If true more western
culture pilots were flying longer trips (such as from west-
ern to eastern culture countries) compared to true less
western culture pilots, then these more western culture pi-
lots may be more likely to initiate surveys in less western
culture countries because of more downtime between
flights. This could result in the misclassification of less
western culture pilots appearing to have higher prevalence
of meeting threshold for depression. Underlying factors
could stem from longer trips increasing the risk of experi-
encing greater circadian rhythm disruption and longer ex-
posure to other possible occupational factors related to
mental illness. This misclassification also could occur the
other way with healthier true less western culture pilots
flying to more western culture countries and initiating sur-
veys. Thus making western pilots appear healthier.
Another explanation for this result is that type of cul-
ture the pilots identify themselves with and country of
survey initiation is an accurate match and that pilots
from more western culture countries in our study have a
lower prevalence of meeting depression threshold. We
were unable to validate what culture pilots identify with
due to lack of data. Nevertheless, even if the country of
survey initiation accurately matches with pilots’ culture
identification, our study has limited data on pilots sur-
veyed outside western culture countries.
The prevalence of having suicidal thoughts between
more western and less western culture countries of sur-
vey initiation was not significantly different at the 0.05
level. That said, the slightly higher prevalence of suicidal
thoughts among less western culture countries may be
due to the reasons given for the difference in prevalence
of depression.
Additionally, the results of the comparison of more
against less western culture countries in our study do not
align with patterns in survey results of mental disorders
around the world [33]. These surveys find more western
culture countries generally having a higher 12-month
prevalence of mood disorders [33]. However, researchers
note that differences in mood disorder prevalence between
high and low prevalence countries are likely smaller than
the surveys show [33]. This is likely due to more under-
estimation of prevalence in low prevalence countries [33].
Consequently, this provides further evidence that the type
of culture the pilots identify with in our study and country
of survey initiation is not an accurate match.
Moving more generally, the topic of mental illness
among airline pilots is not new, but identifying and
assisting pilots with mental illness remains a present day
challenge. Although the results of this study do not
gauge pilots’ level of access to mental health treatment,
it stimulates dialogue of treatment options available to
assist pilots. More importantly, the subpopulations of

 victims of sexual or verbal harassment need even more
urgent assistance. That said, barriers to seeking treat-
ment for mental health issues among high stress occupa-
tions such as military personnel deployed in combat
operations, emergency situation first responders, and
firefighters and police officers are documented in the lit-
erature [34–36]. Although different in degree and sever-
ity of stressors, commercial airline pilots may experience
similar occupational and individual barriers to seeking
treatment [37]. These include shift-work, long and con-
tinuous hours, and increased stigma towards admitting
one has mental health problems resulting from work.
Long and continuous work-hours make scheduling treat-
ment difficult [38]. In addition, researchers attribute stigma
among workers in high stress public safety protection occu-
pations, which we argue includes piloting commercial air-
craft, to the emphasis on being resilient and independent;
thus, admitting having a mental health problem is extremely
difficult [39, 40]. Other barriers to seeking treatment include
increased social withdrawal among those experiencing
symptoms of mental health problems such as depression
[41] and concerns toward treatment (e.g., not trusting men-
tal health professionals) [41, 42] and self-reporting (e.g., be-
lief admitting will cause harm to career) [43], and social
norms (e.g., weak support of those getting treatment) [34].
Since mental health problems are prevalent among
our participants and maybe exacerbated in high stress
work situations, we agree with the argument that organiza-
tions are responsible for ensuring employees who develop
mental health problems receive timely mental health treat-
ment [40]. Houdmont, Leka, and Sinclair [34] discuss three
ways to increase treatment seeking among employees: (1)
normalizing the receipt of needed mental health treatment
(e.g., getting leadership endorsement), (2) emphasizing get-
ting mental health treatment will prevent more severe
problems from affecting employee performance, and (3) tai-
loring treatment to the occupational context. There are a
number of deliverable solutions currently in place, which
incorporate elements of these three recommendations.
Specifically, applying traditional cognitive behavioral
treatment (CBT) while integrating work experiences
shows promise in faster return to work among those
on leave for mental health issues [44]. Furthermore,
research supports the efficacy of internet-based treat-
ments (e.g., CBT delivered online) as a viable option
[45] for mild to moderate depression [46]. Reviews of
internet-based psychological treatments for depression
such as Internet-based CBT (ICBT) find it an effect-
ive alternative to face-to-face psychological treatments
with the caveat that guided ICBT is more effective
than unguided [47]. Findings also support therapist
contact before and/or after ICBT have further effica-
cious effect of treatment [47]. Concerns toward ICBT
include a meta-analysis published in 2013 of effectiveness
of computerized CBT on adult depression showing the
lack of significant effect of long-term treatment outcomes
compared to short-term treatment duration and signifi-
cantly high participant drop-out [48].

 Despite the disadvantages, we believe the above studies
give good reason for increased attention to commercial
airlines considering work-experience tailored interventions
such as ICBT for treating mental health problems, specif-
ically depression, among pilots. Such initiatives could run
parallel with leadership endorsement of professional face-
to-face contact throughout the guided recovery process.
We acknowledge our study does not evaluate how to in-
crease access to treatment and cannot rate or recommend
a specific treatment. However, ICBT is one example of a
possible intervention found in the literature.
We acknowledge the inability to draw causal inferences
due to the study design. However, the numbers raise con-
cern regarding mental health among pilots. Limitations of
this study include potential underestimation of frequencies
of adverse mental health outcomes due to less participa-
tion among participants with more severe depression
compared to those with less severe or without depression.
This would lead to downward bias of the true estimate of
depression prevalence over the survey period. Conversely,
upward bias could occur if participants with underlying
mental illness are more likely to participate and complete
a survey than those without illness due to participant fa-
miliarity with the purpose of the study. We believe upward
bias is minimized since participants are less likely to know
the focus of our study because the survey covers many
topics other than depression or suicidal thoughts. In
addition, the survey was not described to participants as a
mental health study but as a pilot health study.
Furthermore, completers worked as a pilot signifi-
cantly longer on average than non-completers by over a
year and more of them worked in the past 30 days than
non-completers. Because of this, completers may exhibit
better general health than non-completers and report
lower frequency of depressive symptoms. We could not
assess this due to non-responses.
Another source of underestimation is the length of the
online survey. After implementation, we received feed-
back regarding the survey being too lengthy. Thus, if
survey completers are different in characteristics from
non-completers and if this difference influences depression
scores, we posit the length of the survey may discourage
more depressed participants from completing the survey.
This also would result in downward bias.
This study did not conduct clinical interviews of survey
respondents to confirm diagnosis of depression, nor did it
have access to medical records. We felt the strength of
participant anonymity out-weighed the ability to gather
this information, and the medical literature provides
evidence for good sensitivity and specificity of the
PHQ-9 diagnosis compared with diagnosis from structured
interviews [26, 28, 29].
Another limitation of this study is reduced generalizability
to the general population of airline pilots. This is due
to non-random sampling, incomplete participation, and
the inability to determine an exact reference population
due to anonymous participation. That said, aviation health
researchers have utilized anonymous surveying before and
published results while acknowledging these same limita-
tions [18]. Furthermore, the only way to achieve responses
from airline pilots was to make the survey completely
anonymous. Nevertheless, the key findings remain sur-
prising–hundreds of pilots currently flying are man-
aging depression, and even suicidal thoughts, without
the possibility of treatment due to the fear of negative
career impacts.
Conclusion
This study fills an important gap of knowledge by provid-
ing a current glimpse of mental health among commercial
airline pilots, which to date had not been available. Our
study found 233 (12.6%) of the 1848 airline pilots respond-
ing to the PHQ-9 met criteria for likely depression. Of the
1430 pilots who reported working as an airline pilot in the
last seven days at time of survey, 193 (13.5%) met these
criteria. Seventy-five participants (4.1%) reported having
thoughts of better being off dead or self-harm within the
past two weeks. We found a significant trend in propor-
tions of depression at higher levels of use of sleep-aid
medication (trend test z = 6.74, p < 0.001) and among
those experiencing sexual harassment (z = 3.18, p = 0.001)
or verbal harassment (z = 6.13, p < 0.001). Although the re-
sults have limited generalizability, there are a significant
number of active pilots suffering from depressive symp-
toms. Future studies will evaluate additional predictors
such as sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances.
Poor mental health is an enormous burden to public
health worldwide. The tragedy of Germanwings flight
4U 9525 should motivate further research into assessing
the issue of pilot mental health. Although current pol-
icies aim to improve mental health screening, evaluation,
and record keeping, airlines and aviation organizations
should increase support for preventative treatment.
