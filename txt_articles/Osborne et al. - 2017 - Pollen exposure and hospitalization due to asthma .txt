Abstract Exposure to pollen can contribute to increased hos-
pital admissions for asthma exacerbation. This study applied
an ecological time series analysis to examine associations be-
tween atmospheric concentrations of different pollen types
and the risk of hospitalization for asthma in London from
2005 to 2011. The analysis examined short-term associations
between daily pollen counts and hospital admissions in the
presence of seasonal and long-term patterns, and allowed for
time lags between exposure and admission. Models were ad-
justed for temperature, precipitation, humidity, day of week,
and air pollutants. Analyses revealed an association between
daily counts (continuous) of grass pollen and adult hospital
admissions for asthma in London, with a 4–5-day lag. When
grass pollen concentrations were categorized into Met Office
pollen ‘alert’ levels, ‘very high’ days (vs. ‘low’) were associ-
ated with increased admissions 2–5 days later, peaking at an
incidence rate ratio of 1.46 (95%, CI 1.20–1.78) at 3 days.
Increased admissions were also associated with ‘high’ versus
‘low’ pollen days at a 3-day lag. Results from tree pollen
models were inconclusive and likely to have been affected
by the shorter pollen seasons and consequent limited number
of observation days with higher tree pollen concentrations.
Future reductions in asthma hospitalizations may be achieved
by better understanding of environmental risks, informing im-
proved alert systems and supporting patients to take preven-
tive measures.

Introduction
Over the last 20 years, there has been an increase in the prev-
alence of asthma worldwide both in the high-income and in
the less-industrialized world, placing an increased burden on
health systems (Asher et al. 2006; WHO 2016). By 2006,
across the 37 countries (high medium and low income on four
continents) in the International Study of Asthma and Allergies
in Childhood (ISAAC) study, the mean prevalence amongst
6–7 year olds of asthma was 12.6% and that of allergic
rhinoconjunctivitis 8.5%. The total Global Burden of
Disease due to asthma is estimated to be around 25 million
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and 11 million years of
life lost (YLLs) per year (WHO 2016).

Pollen exposure and hospitalization due to asthma exacerbations:
daily time series in a European city
 Allergy and asthma both increased in prevalence in the UK
population over a 20-year period (Anderson et al. 2004), with
asthma prevalence appearing to have plateaued but allergy
prevalence having continued to climb (Prescott and Allen
2011). UK figures in Phase 3 of the ISAAC study were
amongst some of the highest, with a prevalence of 20.9% for
asthma and 10.1% for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis amongst 6–
7 year olds (Asher et al. 2006). Adult asthma prevalence in the
UK has been measured at 17.6% (self-reported doctor
diagnosed) and 18.2% (clinical asthma) (To et al. 2012). The
direct costs of asthma to the UK National Health Service
(NHS) are estimated at approximately £1 billion annually,
with additional indirect costs (e.g. due to time off work and
loss of productivity) of around £6 billion (NHS 2013).
Although asthma attacks are usually controllable with treat-
ment, a proportion of patients fail to manage their illness ad-
equately. In the UK, such asthma exacerbations (an increase in
severity of the disease and in the case of asthma and its signs
and symptoms, e.g. shortness of breath) lead to 50,000 hospi-
tal admissions per annum, over 1200 deaths, and an annual
spend of £800 million on pharmaceuticals (NHS 2013).
Factors that may induce allergic reactions and asthma ex-
acerbations are wide-ranging and, depending on the individual
triggers, include pollen, house dust mites, air pollution, weath-
er changes, exercise, airborne irritants such as tobacco smoke,
emotional factors, occupational sensitizers, and some pharma-
ceuticals and foods (SIGN and BTS 2011). The role of pollen
in asthma exacerbation is increasingly understood (Osborne
and Eggen 2015). For instance, a significant association be-
tween grass pollen exposure and hospital admission for asth-
ma has been reported in Australia (in both adults (Erbas et al.
2007) and children (Erbas et al. 2012)), France (Huynh et al.
2010), UK (Lewis et al. 2000), Spain (Tobías et al. 2004;
Altzibar et al. 2014), Italy (Ruffoni et al. 2013), Hungary
(Makra et al. 2012), and the USA (Jariwala et al. 2014;
Gleason et al. 2014; Darrow et al. 2012). Other health out-
comes previously associated with acute pollen exposures in-
clude allergic rhinitis, food allergy (Datema et al. 2015), eo-
sinophilic esophagitis (van Rhijn et al. 2013), cardiovascular
events (Brunekreef et al. 2000), preterm births (Lavigne et al.
2014), and mental health impacts (Qin et al. 2013). There is
evidence that the levels (Negrini et al. 2011; Ziello et al. 2012)
and potentially the allergenicity of pollen are increasing with
time, possibly associated with global climate change (Singer
et al. 2005; Vardoulakis and Heaviside 2012).
Pollen concentrations are highly variable on a daily basis
due to a number of factors including plant pollen production
and weather conditions. Pollen may travel long distances, and
the concentration of pollen in the air (particles per m3) is
therefore not just a localized phenomenon. Measured pollen
concentrations have been found to correlate across distances
of 20 km (Erbas et al. 2007) and 41 km (Pashley et al. 2009),
and the potential exists for pollen to travel much further,
including trans-continentally (Skjoth et al. 2007). In the UK,
pollen from tree species is released in the March to April
period, and grass pollen (from numerous species) during the
period mid-May to July in most years. Weed pollen is released
from the end of June until September.
In addition to the types of source vegetation, factors that
could be important in influencing pollen-asthma associations
include precipitation, humidity, thunderstorms, wind, periods
of dry weather, atmospheric blocking, and heat. These may
well be difficult to separate as individual factors, as they are
often strongly linked (e.g. temperature and pollination in
plants), and it can be difficult to identify sufficiently large data
sets to perform the appropriate stratified analyses. The role of
thunderstorms/lightning in the increased risk of hospitaliza-
tion due to pollen has also been recorded in various countries
(Newson et al. 1998; Bellomo et al. 1992; D’Amato et al.
2005), but it is still unclear how often this occurs, nor its
potential burden on the health system (Dabrera et al. 2013).
The potential exists for air pollution, primarily from traffic
and other combustion activities (measured as PM10, PM2.5,
NOx) and ground-level ozone, to interact with pollen, syner-
gistically increasing the negative effects of pollen on respira-
tory health (Diaz-Sanchez et al. 1997). High levels of air pol-
lution have been found to increase the allergenicity of pollen
in plants growing in areas of high air pollution (Ghiani et al.
2012). However, some epidemiological evidence finds no ef-
fect from air pollution on the relationship between pollen and
asthma exacerbation, so the interaction is not entirely clear
(Lewis et al. 2000; Tobías et al. 2004).
The current study extends previous work by examining the
relationship between daily pollen counts for a number of plant
species/genus and hospitalizations for asthma. Reflecting the
issue of growing urbanization, the current work focuses on the
pollen-asthma relationship in a large urban conurbation.
London was chosen as a study site as it has a large population
with high density of population and health service provision,
whilst having pollen concentrations (grains/m3) equivalent to
other areas in the UK that have been monitored on a daily
basis for a number of years. Allowing for lag periods and
potential confounding, we hypothesized that days with higher
pollen counts are associated with higher emergency hospital
admissions for asthma.
Materials and methods
We used an ecological time series analysis to examine associ-
ations between daily pollen concentrations and hospital ad-
missions for asthma in London. This approach allows for the
investigation of potential time lags between pollen exposure
and hospitalization for asthma, since we do not necessarily
expect admissions to occur on the same day as pollen expo-
sure (Ito et al. 2015; Bhaskaran et al. 2013; Erbas et al. 2012).

Int J Biometeorol (2017) 61:1837–1848
 The approach also permits simultaneous consideration of the
role of daily variation in meteorological conditions and air
pollutant concentrations in predicting admission rates. The
following sections describe the data sources regarding the pri-
mary health outcome, exposures of interest, and potential con-
founders included in analyses.
Study site and population
Greater London is the UK’s largest city, and covers 1572 km2
with a population of approximately 8.2 million (2011 Census,
https://www.ons.gov.uk/census). It has a temperate oceanic
climate (Köppen-Geiger climate classification: Cfb—warm
temperate, fully humid, warm summer (Kottek et al. 2006)),
with average daily mean temperature (1980–2010) of 18.3 °C
and 45 mm precipitation in July (Met Office 2017). London
has 40% greenspace or open water by area, and over 2000
species of flowering plant have been recorded (LNHS 2017).
Asthma outcome data
Counts of emergency in-patient admissions for asthma (ICD-
10 J45 and J46) for all residents of Greater London (specifi-
cally those within the London Government Office Region)
were derived for the observation days from Hospital Episode
Statistics (HES) data for years 2005–2011 (linked with avail-
able pollen data as described below). HES captures all in-
patient admissions to National Health Service hospitals in
England, and whilst it is fundamentally an administrative da-
tabase, it has been used extensively for similar epidemiologi-
cal research (Atkinson et al. 2006). We restricted the sample to
the working age population (16–64 years) to focus on adult
asthma, excluding both children and older people (the latter
would have a higher prevalence of comorbidities such as
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]).
Pollen data
Airborne pollen was collected at a single pollen monitoring
site in Islington, central London, from 2005 to 2011 (see
Fig. 1) using a Burkard 7-day volumetric trap in accordance
with British Aerobiology Federation protocols (BAF 1995).
The drum was changed at 09:00 daily, and the tape prepared
for microscopy. Pollen grains were identified to family (all
species included), and counted by trained specialists across
12 transverses of the 24-h slides. A correction factor was ap-
plied to give the pollen count for each family for that 24-h
period. Resulting count figures were converted into pollen
grains per cubic meter of air and classified as the previous
day’s exposure measure. Count data were available for family
Poaceae (all grass combined) and the following tree genus:
Betula (birch), Fraxinus (ash), Platanus (London Plane),
Quercus (oak), and Salix (willow). Of note, ‘grass’ pollen is
counted in total, (i.e. all genus and species in the family), as
visual identification of species-specific pollen types is not
possible (as opposed to pollen from different tree species).
In addition, a count of total pollen concentration for the five
types of tree was derived, and used as a further pollen predic-
tor variable.
From the annual monitoring period, we focused on a com-
mon data analysis period for each year, from 1 April to 31
August 2005–2011 (153 days per year, total 1071 days). There
was some variation in the annual monitoring periods, which at
their extremes ran from 5 March (2008) to 21 September
(2006), as well as missing data on both specific pollen types
and on all pollen (109 days missing data, due to either me-
chanical failure of Burkard trap, early closure of monitoring
station, and/or technician availability). The analysis period 1
April to 31 August covered the peak counts across all pollen
types and had relatively limited missing data (although mon-
itoring ended on 2 August 2009 and on 1 August 2011 due to
the closure of the station). The samples of observation days
used in estimation models of 0–7-day lagged exposure effects
varied by pollen type (grasses, tree species). Calculation of
lagged pollen exposure for the first week of April used mon-
itoring station data from the final week of March, where
available.
Due to the potential for measurement error in pollen counts
(see BDiscussion^ section), pollen was modelled as both count
data and as a categorical variable. Categorization used, where
applicable, thresholds varying by pollen type that are used in
the derivation of the ‘traffic light’ pollen alert warnings issued
for the UK by the Met Office (with days classed as Low,
Medium, High, or Very High pollen levels; http://www.
metoffice.gov.uk/health/public/pollen-forecast, see TS6-11,
supplementary material). The Met Office pollen warnings do
not reference specific pollen types, but are derived from the
analysis of counts against thresholds for the main allergenic
pollen types at any one time throughout the forecast season
based on significance in terms of greatest impact to the
majority of sufferers. No threshold is available for willow
pollen, and therefore, no categorical model was specified.
Air pollution data
Data from government air pollution monitoring stations from
the Automatic Urban and Rural Network (http://uk-air.defra.
gov.uk/data/) were used to calculate the mean daily
concentration (μg/m3) of air pollutants including particulate
matter with aerodynamic diameter under 10 μm (PM10),
nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and ozone
(O3). Data were obtained for urban and suburban background
stations (see Fig. 1) that had <20% missing data from the
periods 25 March to 31 August 2005–2011 (details presented
in Table 1). Missing station values were imputed in a separate
imputation model using chained equations in which complete
Int J Biometeorol (2017) 61:1837–1848
1839
 data on the asthma outcome, day of year, year, humidity, pre-
cipitation, and temperature were included. The mean of 20
imputations for each station was used to fill missing station
data. Following imputation, the daily mean concentration for
each pollutant across London was calculated as the mean
across all included stations.
Meteorological data
Data from the British Atmospheric Data Centre (http://badc.
nerc.ac.uk) were used to calculate the mean of the minimum
and maximum dry bulb temperatures (°C) for seven weather
monitoring stations within Greater London, which reported on
at least 75% of days. Missing station values were imputed in a
separate imputation model, and these were combined into a
single daily mean series using previously established methods
(Armstrong et al. 2011). A new metric ‘recent temperature’,
the index providing the best fit in exploratory analyses, was
derived as the mean of this temperature on each day and the
previous 3 days. Precipitation and relative humidity measures,
obtained via MEDMI (https://www.data-mashup.org.uk)
(Hajat et al. 2017), were derived as the mean of 53 and 12
weather stations, respectively, within 30 km of the city centre
(here 51.49° N, 0.085° E). The daily mean value for each
weather parameter was a simple mean across all stations (fol-
lowing imputation of missing values where necessary).
Model specification
Figure 2 depicts the conceptual framework underpinning the
analyses. Model development followed the procedures recom-
mended by Bhaskaran et al. (2013). Estimation of the impact
of pollen types on asthma admissions in an ecological time
series regression assumed a Poisson distribution with scale
Fig. 1 Locations of pollen and air quality monitors, within London Government Office Region

Int J Biometeorol (2017) 61:1837–1848
 over-dispersion. We used natural cubic splines of time to
flexibly model slow-changing seasonal patterns in the asth-
ma data. Since these splines are parameterized, we used a
generalized linear model rather than a generalized additive
model, since the latter approach is only necessary when
using non-parametric spline functions. In this case, spline
functions were used to summarize the relationships in pre-
liminary investigations of the functional form, and support-
ed the assumption of the linear functional form. Preliminary
investigations of the cross-correlation functions between
the asthma outcome and explanatory variables informed
the model development.
Within-season trend was accounted for using natural cubic
splines of observation days in study seasons with five degrees
of freedom per annual season (four internal knots placed equi-
distantly within each season), determined by examination of
residual autocorrelation. Sensitivity analyses showed the re-
sults to be robust to a more aggressive control for within-
season trend using eight degrees of freedom per annual sea-
son. Regression models were specified to estimate the change
in risk of asthma hospitalization at the 95th percentile versus
the 0th percentile associated with 0–7-day lags in
unconstrained distributed lag models. We took this approach
to reporting associations since it permits direct comparison of
effect sizes between pollen types, and was comparable to the
approach used in a recent study to examine the relationship
between tree pollen counts and hospital admissions in New
York City (Ito et al. 2015). All analyses were carried out with
the ‘glm’ command in Stata 13 (StataCorp, College Station,
USA).
Models further adjusted for 0–7-day lags of PM10, NO2,
SO2, and O3 with an unconstrained lag form and a linear
functional form specified, and for 0–7-day lags of natural
cubic splines of recent temperature (as defined above), pre-
cipitation, and relative humidity with an unconstrained lag
form and with two degrees of freedom for the functional
form. Models also included categorical variables for day
of the week and public holidays (since outdoor activity, air
pollution levels, and hospital attendance may vary accord-
ingly), and to adjust for any secular trends, a linear term for
time was included. Residual autocorrelation from this initial
specification was further adjusted for in the final specifica-
tion by the inclusion of 1-day-lagged deviance residual
terms.

 Results
The total number of adult (age 16–64 years) asthma admis-
sions included across the entire study period was 11,984 (al-
though the number considered in each regression model var-
ied according to the subset of days included). Overall, the
models demonstrated an association between asthma hospital-
izations and grass pollen concentrations, but not tree pollen,
after controlling for air pollution and weather variables.
Descriptive statistics on the daily variables included in the
estimation samples for the grass pollen models are presented
in Table 2. These indicate, for example, that across 799 ob-
served days included in the grass pollen models, there were a
mean of 11.3 emergency admissions for asthma per day, with
a minimum of 2 and a maximum 89. Across the same set of
observed days, the mean grass pollen count was 24.5 grains/
m3, with a range from 0 to 474 grains/m3. Equivalent descrip-
tive statistics for the tree pollen model estimation samples are
provided in supplementary tables for brevity (TS1-5).
Effect estimates at 0–7-day lags from the time series regres-
sion models are presented in Table 3, as the percentage change
in the count of emergency in-patient admissions for asthma
associated with 0 to 95th percentile increases in pollen (i.e.
total grasses, the five tree types, and the total of these tree
pollen concentrations). The number of days in which the
95th percentile count of pollen was observed or exceeded is
tabulated by year in Table 4: for all pollen types, pollen counts
reached the 95th percentile in at least 6 of the 7 years, and on
several days in most years. Results in Table 3 indicate that
higher grass pollen counts were associated with increased ad-
missions at 4- and 5-day lags (p < 0.001); predicted admis-
sions against grass pollen counts of 0–150 are presented in
Fig. 3. In contrast, there was little observed effect from any of
the tree pollen, considered alone or in total. Increases in ad-
mission rates were associated with ash pollen at a 4-day lag
(p = 0.044) and willow pollen at a 2-day lag (p = 0.025), but
without clear patterns or a priori specification of these lags,
and because of the multiple comparisons being performed, it
is difficult to infer causal association. These findings are un-
likely to be the result of residual confounding with daily back-
ground air pollutant levels, since the correlations between air
pollutants and species pollen were generally low (Table 5).
Descriptive statistics and results from regression of admis-
sions against categorical pollen measures reflecting Met
Office warning levels are presented in supplementary
Tables TS6-11. Supplementary Table TS6 indicates the num-
ber of observation days for each of the five pollen types falling
into the threshold categories used by the Met Office, and re-
gression results are in TS7-11. The categorical model for grass
pollen (TS7) produced similar results to the continuous model.
‘Very high’ grass pollen days were associated with increased
incidence of asthma admissions relative to ‘low’ grass pollen
days at 2–5-day lags, with a peak incidence rate ratio (IRR) of
1.46 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20–1.78) at a 3-day lag.
‘High’ versus low grass pollen days were only associated with
increased admissions at a 3-day lag (IRR 1.14; 95% CI 1.01,
1.27). However, very high grass pollen days were also asso-
ciated with a subsequent decrease in admission rate at 0–1-day
lags (with the lowest IRR 0.72; 95% CI 0.59, 0.87 at 0 days).
Again, consistent with models fit with continuous pollen
exposure variables, there were few clear associations between
categorical tree pollen levels and asthma admissions.
Selecting those results with a p value <0.05, there was a sug-
gestion of an association with ash pollen (TS9) at a 2–3-day
lag; peak IRRs comparing high (13 observation days) versus
low (659 observation days) ash pollen at 2-day lag IRR = 1.52
(95% CI 1.01–2.27); and very high (3 observation days) ver-
sus low at 2-day lag IRR = 2.01 (95% CI 0.65–6.28).
Categorical models also suggested higher admission rates at
5-day lag comparing ‘medium’ and low London plane pollen
days (TS10), but also indicated lower admission rates at 4-day
lag comparing very high to low oak pollen days (TS11).
Whilst there were a small number of tree pollen category/lag
day combinations giving rise to apparent associations, these

Discussion
Key findings
Ecological time series analysis across 7 years found evidence
of an association between daily total grass pollen concentra-
tion and adult emergency hospital in-patient admissions for
asthma in London. There was a lag between exposure and
admission of 4 to 5 days in models with grass pollen measured
as a continuous variable, and 2 to 5 days where concentrations
were categorized into Met Office pollen warning bands. There
was no ‘same-day’ association apparent in the continuous
models, although there was some suggestion in categorical
models of a reduced risk of admission on the same day or
the day after very high grass pollen counts (followed by in-
creased risk at days 2–5). Associations observed in these
models were apparent after adjustment for key potential con-
founders including air pollutant concentrations, weather, and
day of week. There were no clear patterns of association be-
tween the number of admissions and concentrations of pollen
from five tree types (birch, ash, London plane, oak, willow),
either when considered individually or collectively. Whilst
there were some suggestions of associations, there were very
small numbers of observation days at higher levels (particu-
larly important for categorical models), and the multiple com-
parisons and lack of a priori specific hypotheses mean that
these isolated findings could be spurious.
The findings for grass pollen are consistent with previous
evidence suggesting short-term increases in hospitalizations
for asthma associated with pollen concentrations e.g. Erbas
et al. (2007). The observed lag period is also consistent with
some previous work; for example Tobías et al. (2004) found a
lag of 3 days investigating total grass pollen levels and emer-
gency asthma admissions in Madrid, Spain. However, the
finding from the categorical models of a reduced risk of ad-
mission on the same day or day after very high grass pollen
levels (relative to low days) is difficult to explain, even though
this was followed by increased risk at days 2 to 5. Reduced
risk on high pollen days could possibly be due to a reverse
causation effect, because of increased use of antihistamines
and other medications and better asthma management when
pollen levels are very high, as patients have increased aware-
ness with increased symptoms.
The lack of any clear association between tree pollen con-
centrations and asthma admissions is not consistent with some
previous work, such as a study in New York City which did
find associations between tree pollen (including birch, ash,
London plane, and oak) and subsequent asthma emergency

 department visits (Ito et al. 2015). One explanation for this
difference in findings could be differences in vegetation mix/
climate and consequent pollen concentrations between the
two locations; mean concentrations of ash, birch, and oak
pollen were much higher in the New York study than
London (although mean London plane pollen concentrations
were higher in London). It is also possible that some of the
inconsistencies with existing evidence could also be explained
by residual confounding, or by potential errors introduced by
design limitations, as discussed below.
Strengths and limitations
The application of an ecological time series regression model
to examine correlations between daily pollen and hospital ad-
missions allows investigation of these acute relationships
whilst accounting for a variety of potentially confounding
environmental variables known to be related to both pollen
levels and asthma admissions (e.g. temperature, precipitation,
air pollution). Time series regression models are ideally suited
to this type of examination of associations between acute,
transient environmental exposures and short-term health out-
comes (Bhaskaran et al. 2013). The models used here have the
advantage of not only examining associations between expo-
sures and outcomes whilst adjusting for potential or known
confounders at a daily level but also modelling of short-term
fluctuations in the presence of long-term or seasonal trends, as
well as allowing for any time lag between exposure and effect.
Furthermore, day of the week and public holidays are known
to influence hospital attendance, and these have been
accounted for in the current models.
The approach capitalizes on population-scale health data
for a large city and hence a large study population, alongside
several environmental time series data sets that have been
collected consistently over the study period. We found only
low levels of correlation between measures of air pollution
and pollen levels, reducing the likelihood of confounding,
comparable with previous London-based research (Anderson
et al. 1998). By considering categorical versions of pollen
concentration variables, we are able to relate the findings to
the warnings produced to alert the public to high levels of
pollen.
The study is subject to a number of design and data limi-
tations. A key issue, common to much environmental epide-
miology research, is that of environmental exposure assess-
ment for pollen and potential confounders. Pollen was mea-
sured at a single site, and the measurements assumed to apply
to the entire London population. Whilst pollen levels are likely
to vary within the city, leading to exposure estimation errors,
previous work comparing two English cities has suggested
that pollen measurements up to 41 km apart are highly corre-
lated, with near-perfect agreement between daily alert/forecast
categories (Pashley et al. 2009). Since the pollen monitor pro-
ducing the data for this study was located in central London,
the maximum distance to the Government Office Region bor-
der defining the study population was only around 32 km.
Similarly, the analyses assumed that the summary measures
of air pollution concentrations and weather variables applied
uniformly across the population of the city. London covers a
large geographical area and is expected to have a series of
microclimates across the area, and air pollution concentrations
are known to vary on a fine spatial scale. Whilst this use of
ecological exposure measurements leads to potential exposure
misclassification on important confounders, again, the ap-
proach is common in this type of time series epidemiology
(Bhaskaran et al. 2013; Katsouyanni et al. 1996). It is likely
that the daily trends in relative change in pollen and covariate
values in different parts of the city are broadly uniform, de-
spite higher/lower baselines due to local circumstances. The
measure of particulates available from London monitors was
the concentration of PM10; ideally, we would have allowed for
confounding by PM2.5, but daily data for the study time period
were not available.
Whilst daily data for 7 years were available, the relatively
short length of the pollen season led to a limited number of
days that could be included in each model (maximum 799 for
the grass pollen models). The authors of a recent methodolog-
ical study, which informed our analyses, recommended that
time series analyses (on air pollution effects) need thousands
of observation days with an average of tens of events per day,

 for credible precision and power (Bhaskaran et al. 2013). In
our study, we had only 799 days of pollen measures (grass
models) and on average 11.3 hospitalizations for asthma per
day (range 2 to 89). Limited data meant that the statistical
power was somewhat restricted, reflected in wide confidence
intervals around estimates. Over-dispersion (high variability
in patient counts) may further reduce precision; in addition,
measures of pollen were also skewed with a median grass
pollen count at five grains per cubic metre (range 0 to 474).
Evidence from past studies both supports (Cuinica et al.
2014) and opposes (Garty et al. 1998) the hypothesis that air
pollution or its individual constituents may act synergistically
to increase the risk of asthma exacerbations leading to hospital
admittance. However, limited data meant that we were unable
to investigate interaction effects between pollen and air pollu-
tion exposures here; e.g. stratification by high/low days of air
pollution was not possible. Future, longer-term studies that are
able to include more sampling periods could potentially over-
come these limitations.
A related limitation of this study is the lack of days on
which there were high levels of tree pollen. Unlike the com-
bined grass pollen, which typically has a much longer
flowering season with more days of higher pollen concentra-
tions, the individual tree pollen has peak times over short
periods of 2–4 weeks with lower concentrations, again limit-
ing the statistical power to estimate impacts on asthma admis-
sions. Additionally, since tree pollen seasons can overlap sig-
nificantly (e.g. ash and birch), time series analysis may not be
able to determine species-specific associations. However, the
release of pollen from some species is known to occur over a
short time period, and may only reach high levels for a few
days; with sufficient data covering a number of years, these
associations could still potentially be detected. This study only
included data on pollen sampled from 1 April each year. Some
trees (such as hazel, yew, alder, elm, willow, and poplar) tend
to have their peak pollen release in March, and hence, their
times of high pollen exposure may have been missed. Birch,
ash, London plane, and oak tend to have peak pollen release in
April, and so these times were usually included in this study.
Currently, grass pollen data are counted in total without
separation of individual species. The potential for individuals
being allergic to some and not all species of grass does exist,
considering the exquisite sensitivity of the IgE molecule to
recognize proteins (Nony et al. 2015). Asthma exacerbations
are not only caused by immunological pathways, but mechan-
ical irritation from dust/pollen may also act as a trigger (Gold
and Wright 2005). Potential differences in size may also play a
role in pollen dispersal and how far into the lungs the particles
can reach. With the current measurement method, grass pollen
concentration exhibits a low arc over the pollen season, initi-
ating in mid-May and ending towards the end of July to early
August. This is a different-shaped curve from the tree pollen
measured at the species level, which tended to be a sharper,
higher peak of counts over a shorter time span, in the case of
oak pollen over a 3-week period. This probably has an evolu-
tionary basis, where species release pollen at a specific time
(instigated by accumulated temperature, humidity/

 precipitation, and potentially photoperiod) when the stigma of
the flowers of the species are ready to accept the pollen to
ensure pollination and not become covered with pollen from
other species, wasting potential reproduction possibilities. It is
thought that grass pollen at the species level may well follow a
similar trend of short high-peaking pollination periods as ob-
served with the tree pollen, and work is currently underway to
examine this (Skjoth et al. 2015; Kmenta et al. 2016). The
flowering of grasses in Vienna have shown a rolling phenol-
ogy over the season with various species of grass from early
April (e.g. Alopecurus pratensis) through to the end of July
(e.g. Cynodon dactylon), with a high peak for the number of
pollen grains around mid-May and mid-June (coinciding with
Holcus lanatus and Lolium perenne pollination periods, re-
spectively) (Kmenta et al. 2016).
Finally, this study only considered London. Whilst this
single-city approach is again comparable with other studies
(e.g. Madrid (Tobías et al. 2004), New York City (Ito et al.
2015)), care should be taken in extrapolating these data to the
entire UK population (or indeed extrapolation to other areas
and populations). London is not representative of the UK,
although the population included here is very large, ca. 8.5
of 65 million UK inhabitants. Not only does it include a youn-
ger, more ethnically diverse population, but also it is located in
the SE of England where climate, landscape, urban effects,
and grass species differ to elsewhere in the country.
Conclusions
In the population of London, UK, daily total grass pollen
concentrations from 2005 to 2011 were associated with in-
creased emergency hospital admissions for asthma amongst
adults aged 16–64, with a lag of 2 to 5 days between exposure
and admission. There was no substantive evidence of a similar
association between asthma admissions and ash, oak, London
plane, willow, or birch tree pollen concentrations, or the total
concentration of pollen from all five trees. Future work would
benefit from longer time series of pollen data, from measures
of exposure to grass species-specific pollen, from ability to
examine linkage between pollen and health outcomes at the
individual level on high and low air pollution days, and po-
tentially from multi-city studies.
