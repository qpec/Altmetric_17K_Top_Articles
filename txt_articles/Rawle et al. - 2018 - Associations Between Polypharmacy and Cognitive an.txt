OBJECTIVES:
To
investigate
longitudinal
associations
between polypharmacy and cognitive and physical capabil-
ity and to determine whether these associations differ with
cumulative exposure to polypharmacy.
DESIGN: Prospective birth cohort study.
SETTING: England, Scotland, and Wales.
PARTICIPANTS: An eligible sample of men and women
from the Medical Research Council National Survey of
Health and Development with medication data at age 69
(N52,122, 79%).
MEASUREMENTS:
Cognitive
capability
was
assessed
using a word learning test, visual search speed task, and
the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination, Third Edition
(ACE-III). Physical capability was measured using chair rise
speed, standing balance time, walking speed, and grip strength.
RESULTS: Polypharmacy (5–8 prescribed medications) was
present in 18.2% of participants at age 69 and excessive
polypharmacy (�9 prescribed medications) in 4.7%. Both
were associated with poorer cognitive and physical capabil-
ity in models adjusted for sex, education, and disease bur-
den.
Stronger
associations
were
found
for
excessive
polypharmacy (e.g., difference in mean ACE-III scores com-
paring polypharmacy522.0, 95% CI522.8 to 21.1 and
excessive polypharmacy522.9, 95% CI524.4 to 21.4
with no polypharmacy). Participants with polypharmacy at
age 60 to 64 and at age 69 showed stronger Negative asso-
ciations with cognitive and physical capability were stronger
still in participants with polypharmacy at both age 60 to 64
and at age 69 (e.g. difference in mean chair rise speed, com-
paring
polypharmacy
with
no
polypharmacy
at
both
ages523.9, 95% CI525.2 to 22.6 and at age 60–64
only522.5, 95% CI524.1 to 20.9).
CONCLUSION: Polypharmacy at age 60 to 64 and age 69
was associated with poorer physical and cognitive capability,
even after adjusting for disease burden. Stronger negative
associations were seen in participants with longstanding pol-
ypharmacy, suggesting a cumulative, dose-dependent rela-
tionship
(where
dose
is
the
number
of
prescribed
medications). Future research aiming to improve cognitive
and physical capability should consider interventions to
reduce the duration and level of polypharmacy at younger
ages, in addition to optimizing disease control with appropri-
ate medications. J Am Geriatr Soc 66:916–923, 2018.

P
olypharmacy is a growing phenomenon in the United
Kingdom, with a little more than one-fifth of the adult
population now prescribed more than 5 medications.1 Par-
ticularly at risk are older adults, individuals with lower
levels of education, and those with higher levels of disease
burden.2 Polypharmacy itself is associated with numerous
negative clinical outcomes, including greater risk of falls,
premature mortality, and adverse drug reactions.3 Associa-
tions between polypharmacy and objective measures of
physical impairment (in particular lower limb function)
have been noted in observational cohort studies,4,5 sug-
gesting that polypharmacy may have an effect on underly-
ing physical capability, leading to these negative clinical
outcomes. In a prospective cohort study of 294 individuals
aged 75 and older, individuals taking more than 10 medi-
cations were less able to perform instrumental activities of
daily living and had lower Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE) scores, even when accounting for disease bur-
den,6 than those taking fewer than 10 medications.
Despite these findings, trials studying the effect of medi-
cation reduction on clinical measures of cognitive and physi-
cal capability have found no associated improvements after
medication cessation.7–10 There are at least 2 possible unex-
plored reasons for this observed lack of effect. The first is
that studies have focused on broad outcome measures, such

 as fewer falls, rather than subtler changes in physical and
cognitive capability. The second is that prolonged rather
than contemporaneous polypharmacy may have a stronger
influence on physical and cognitive capability.
To address these important gaps, we examined associ-
ations between polypharmacy and detailed measures of
physical
and
cognitive
capability
in
a
population-
representative, age-homogenous birth cohort, adjusting for
disease burden. We hypothesized that higher levels of pol-
ypharmacy would be associated with poorer cognitive and
physical capability and that these associations would be
more pronounced with longer exposure to polypharmacy.
METHODS
The Medical Research Council National Survey of Health
and Development (NSHD), has followed 5,362 individuals
(2,547 female) since their birth in England, Scotland, or
Wales in a single week of March 1946, so far to age
71.11,12 The most recent data collection was conducted
when participants were aged 68 to 69. After responding to
a postal questionnaire, participants still alive and with a
known current address in mainland Britain (n52,698)
were invited to have a home visit at age 69; 2,149
(79.7%) visits were completed. Invitations were not sent
to those who had died (n5995), were living abroad
(n5583), restricted participation to postal questionnaires
(n522),
had
previously
withdrawn
from
the
study
(n5632), or had been lost to follow-up (n5432).11
Cognitive Capability Outcomes
Trained research nurses tested cognitive capability at age
69. Verbal memory was assessed using a 3-trial 15-item
word learning task (range 0–45), with 2 word lists alter-
nated over waves to minimize practice effects, and proc-
essing speed was assessed using a verbal search speed task,
in which participants are asked to cross out randomly dis-
tributed letters ‘P’ and ‘W’ in a grid of other letters as
quickly and accurately as possible in 1 minute (range 0–
600). The Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination, Third
Edition (ACE-III) was also administered; this is a cognitive
screening battery designed to detect risk of Alzheimer’s
disease and cognitive impairment that is commonly used
in clinical practice.13 It is scored across varying cognitive
subdomains, with a maximum score of 100. Because
verbal fluency is included, distribution of the total score is
quasi-normal and avoids the pronounced ceiling effect of
most cognitive state tests.
Physical Capability Outcomes
The research nurses administered 4 tests of physical capabil-
ity at age 69 following standard protocols.14 To assess chair
rise speed (number of stands/min), participants were timed
standing up and sitting back down from a chair 10 times as
fast as possible (or 5 times if they were unable to complete
10 rises (n53)). Usual walking speed was recorded twice
over a distance of 2.44 m from a standing start, with the
faster of the 2 speeds used in analyses. Standing balance
was measured as the length of time participants were able
to stand on 1 leg with their eyes closed for a maximum of
30 seconds. A natural log-plus-1 transformation was used
to take account of the skewed distribution of balance times.
Grip strength was assessed using a Jamar electronic dyna-
mometer in a seated position.15 Two measures per hand
were recorded, with the maximum of all 4 measures
achieved used in analyses. For all 4 variables, participants
unable to complete the tests for health reasons (n599 for
chair rise speed, n534 for maximum walk speed, n5111
for standing balance, n524 for grip strength) were assigned
a score equal to the mean of the sex-specific lowest fifth for
each measure, consistent with prior work in the NSHD.16
Ascertainment of Polypharmacy
Research nurses collected information on regularly pre-
scribed medication at age 69 and at the previous data collec-
tion at age 60 to 64.12 During both assessments, nurses
recorded all regularly prescribed medications, including as-
needed medications that were regularly used, preferably
using written lists that participants provided rather than
relying on recall. If data were missing from the nurse inter-
view at age 60 to 64, the same information collected in a
postal questionnaire at the same age was substituted
(n562). From these data, we derived a total count of medi-
cations at both time points and an indicator of general poly-
pharmacy adapted from preexisting thresholds,17 namely 5
to 8 medications (polypharmacy) and 9 or more medications
(excessive polypharmacy). For analysis of longitudinal data,
a 4-category variable was derived that indicated whether
polypharmacy (�5 medications) was present at: neither age,
60 to 64 only, 69 only, or both ages.
Covariables
Covariables were factors known to influence the risk of
polypharmacy: sex, education, and disease burden.2,18 In
models of physical capability, we also included body mass
index (BMI) and standing height, given the important
influence of body size on performance on these tests.15,19
Education was defined as highest educational qualifica-
tions achieved by age 26, grouped into three categories
(none, General Certificate of Secondary Education ordinary
secondary level or their equivalents, and advanced second-
ary level or higher). Disease burden at age 69 was defined
according to measures. The first was a count of 0, 1, 2, or 3
or more self-reported doctor-diagnosed chronic diseases or
disorders over the last 10 years. Disease severity was
assessed according to binary responses to the question, “Do
you have any long-term illness, health problem or disability
that limits the activities or work you can do?” Trained
nurses measured weight (kg) and standing height (meters)
during the home visit at age 69, which were used to calculate
BMI. If height was missing at age 69, height recorded at age
60 to 64 was substituted (n529).
Finally, for longitudinal models, equivalent measures
of cognitive and physical capability assessed at age 60 to
64 were used to take account of baseline levels of capabil-
ity. These measures were assessed using similar methodol-
ogy and protocols as at age 69, with the exception of
ACE-III, which was not tested at age 60 to 64.

 Ethics
Ethical approval for the NSHD data collection at age 68 to
69 was obtained from the Queen Square Research Ethics
Committee (14/LO/1073) and the Scotland A Research
Ethics Committee (14/SS/1009). At each stage of data collec-
tion, all participants provided written informed consent.
Statistical Methods
Associations between polypharmacy and cognitive and physi-
cal capability were tested using linear regression models. For-
mal tests in initial models showed no evidence of an
interaction with sex, so all subsequent models were sex-
adjusted. A stepwise process initially tested simple sex-adjusted
associations between exposure and outcome (Model 1), fol-
lowed by adjustment for education and disease burden for all
outcomes, with additional adjustment for BMI and standing
height for physical capability outcomes (Model 2). For longitu-
dinal associations, an additional model also adjusted for the
equivalent cognitive or physical outcome measure at age 60 to
64 to estimate any association between polypharmacy and
change in capability (Model 3). ACE-III measures were omit-
ted from Model 3 because no ACE-III data were available for
age 60 to 64. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on sex-
adjusted models on the maximum sample for each outcome
measure and excluding those who were unable to complete
physical capability tests for health reasons. Additional sensitiv-
ity analyses were conducted to further examine participants
without polypharmacy, subdividing the group into those with
no medications and those with 1 to 4 medications. All statisti-
cal analyses were conducted using Stata version 14 (Stata
Corp, College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Of the 2,122 participants who had medication data at
age 69, 2,121 (99.9%) had at least 1 measure of cogni-
tive or physical capability. Of these participants, 2,007
(94.6%) had complete data for all covariables used in
cognitive models and 1,989 (93.8%) for all covariables
used in physical capability models. Medication data
were also available at age 60 to 64 for 1,980 (93.4%)
participants. Of these 1,980 participants who had medi-
cation data at age 60 to 64 and 69, 1,877 (94.8%) had
complete data for all cognitive capability covariables,
and 1,863 (94.0%) had complete data for all physical
capability covariables. With regard to specific physical
outcomes, 1,749 (93.9%) of these had data on chair rise
speed,
1,759
(94.4%)
on
maximum
walking
speed,
1,833 (98.4%) on standing balance, and 1,855 (99.6%)
on maximum grip strength. For cognitive outcomes,
1,719 (96.4%) had data on word learning task score,
1,746 (97.9%) on verbal search speed task score, and
1,445 (81.0%) on total ACE-III score. Characteristics of
the selected sample and those excluded for missing data
are provided in Tables (1–3).
Cross-Sectional Associations Between Polypharmacy
and Cognitive and Physical Capability at Age 69
Three hundred sixty-six (18.2%) participants had poly-
pharmacy at age 69, and it was associated with poorer
cognitive and physical capability on all measures, before
and after covariable adjustment. For all outcomes, exces-
sive polypharmacy, present in 94 (4.7%) participants, was
more strongly associated with poorer performance than
polypharmacy alone (Table 4). Of the cognitive measures,

 those without polypharmacy at either age, with the excep-
tion of grip strength (Table 5). The association between
lower mean grip strength and polypharmacy was stronger
at age 69 only (–2.6 kg, 95% CI523.8 to 21.3),
although when additionally adjusting for grip strength at
age 60 to 64, the strongest association was once again
seen for those with polypharmacy at both ages (–1.9 kg,
95% CI522.9 to 20.9). Although participants with poly-
pharmacy at just 1 age had better cognitive and physical
capability than those with polypharmacy at both ages,
they had poorer capability than those with polypharmacy
at neither age (Figure 2, data for figure provided in Sup-
plementary Table S2).
Participants with polypharmacy at age 60 to 64 had

(–2.5

CI524.1 to 20.9) and walking speed (–0.1 m/s, 95%

at either age. Effect sizes were slightly weaker when com-
paring those with polypharmacy at age 69 only with those
with no polypharmacy at either age (chair rise speed: 21.8
stands/min, 95% CI523.3 to 20.3; walking speed: 0.0 m/
s, 95% CI520.1 to 0.0), although there was no evidence
that these 2 groups with polypharmacy at 60 to 64 or 69
only differed when their effect estimates were compared.
Sensitivity analyses conducted on the maximum sam-
ple did not alter these results. Participants taking no medi-
cation had better cognitive and physical capability than
those prescribed 1 to 4 medications (who were combined
in the reference group for the main analyses) (data pro-
vided in Supplementary Table S3), although mean capabil-
ity in the group taking 1 to 4 medications was markedly
better than that of those with polypharmacy.
DISCUSSION
In a relatively large, nationally representative study popula-
tion, polypharmacy was associated with poorer cognitive
and physical capability at age 69. In all cases in which there
were associations, excessive polypharmacy was associated
with poorer physical and cognitive capability than polyphar-
macy alone. Associations were stronger when there was
exposure to polypharmacy on at least two occasions, as
opposed to a single occasion. These findings suggest that
there are dose-dependent, cumulative negative associations
between polypharmacy and cognitive and physical capability.
A major strength of NSHD is that it is an age-
homogenous birth cohort that is representative of the U.K.
general population born in the post-war era.11,12 Continu-
ous measures of cognitive and physical capability provide
more detailed outcomes for analyses than are measurable
in routine health record databases. In this sample, detailed
information allowed us to control for determinants of pol-
ypharmacy, such as education and disease burden,2 that
might confound associations with capability outcomes.
Longitudinal data also allowed us to examine effects of
cumulative exposure to polypharmacy. Limitations of this
study include sample attrition due to participant loss to
follow-up, which is inherent to all studies of ageing popu-
lations,20 although there was no notable difference in the
prevalence of polypharmacy between 60 to 64 and 69 or
in any measure of cognitive and physical capability at age
69 when included participants were compared with partic-
ipants excluded because of missing data. As such, partici-
pant loss is unlikely to have altered the pattern of
associations observed. An additional limitation of this
study is that medication and disease burden data relied on
self-report, albeit collected by research nurses using pre-
scription lists and diagnostic prompts. Evidence suggests
that self-reported measures of medication correlate well
with pharmacy prescription records,21 and omission from
self-reports of medications not taken may partly account
for medication nonadherence, which is a limitation of
studies using health record data to ascertain this informa-
tion. The accuracy of self-reported diagnosed disease
varies according to condition severity, although reporting
for most major diseases has high accuracy using this

 measure.22 Poorer baseline capability in those with exces-
sive and repeated polypharmacy might partly explain neg-
ative associations between polypharmacy and capability,
because these participants have a higher proportion of
physically limiting conditions for which medication has
been prescribed. To minimize this bias by indication, we
adjusted for disease burden and severity and additionally
for baseline measures of capability. Disease severity is
included to reduce disparity between diagnosed diseases.
Certain conditions, such as congestive heart failure, war-
rant multiple medications and may be more physically and
cognitively disabling than, for example, gastroesophageal
reflux disease. By additionally adjusting for long-term lim-
iting illness, health problem, or disability, this potential
bias is partially mitigated, although it cannot be entirely
eliminated. Although adjustments for disease severity and
baseline capability reduced effect sizes marginally, the
trend toward poorer capability in the presence of poly-
pharmacy was maintained.
Our definition of polypharmacy is based on a numeri-
cal
count
of
prescribed
medications,
which
although
widely accepted, is not without limitations.17 When trans-
lating findings to clinical practice, correct optimization of
pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies for
disease management may still benefit capability. The nega-
tive changes associated with polypharmacy outlined here
may be due to inappropriate or overtreatment or specific
“problem medications,” such as anticholinergic therapies.
Further work is required to explore this.
Our study found consistent evidence of associations
between polypharmacy and cognitive capability.3,23 In con-
trast, in another study, an association was found between

 polypharmacy and lower MMSE scores only in those taking
more than 10 medications.6 The fact that our measures of
cognitive capability were more detailed and finely graded
than the MMSE may explain this difference. Although prior
work on lower limb function assessed using standing bal-
ance, chair rise speed, and a timed 3-m walk also found
associations between polypharmacy and impairment,4 we
found that these associations were stronger in individuals
taking more medications. In addition to findings related to
lower limb function, we observed an association with lower
grip strength. This measure is a component of many com-
monly used measures of frailty, which prior research has
found to be associated with polypharmacy in older popula-
tions.24 Reductions in balance observed in our study may
indicate greater risk of falls, which also have strong associa-
tions with polypharmacy.3,25,26
In addition to the suggestion of a dose response for
polypharmacy (with more medications associated with
poorer capability), a contribution of our study is the sug-
gestion that these associations are more pronounced in
those with cumulative exposure to polypharmacy (at ages
60–64 and 69). Any increase in number of medications
prescribed to an individual raises the risk of unexpected
drug-drug interactions and side effects,1 many of which
could lead to impaired cognitive or physical capability.
Additionally, individuals may become sensitized to medi-
cations or downregulate internal homeostatic or metabolic
processes when experiencing prolonged exposure to a
medication.27,28 This may underlie the cumulative burden
of polypharmacy observed here, with effects becoming
more apparent in later life, when vulnerability to subtle
impairments in cognitive and physical capability increases.
One such example might be seen in the findings of a previ-
ous study29 that found associations between polypharmacy
and incident dementia in a large Taiwanese cohort. Subtle
reductions in cognitive capability related to polypharmacy
may have exposed preexisting dementia or been an early
expression of dementia provoked by polypharmacy. With
regard to our own findings on cognition, we estimate that
the regression coefficient of –2.9 for the association
between excessive polypharmacy and ACE-III score would
result in the majority of those scoring just above the vali-
dated clinical threshold for potential dementia (82/100,
nearly 7% of participants with ACE-III data) to dip below
this score, warranting referral for a clinical investigation.
In addition, existing evidence links decline in the physical
and cognitive capability measures used with mortality,
independent of preexisting health status.30,31
Further trials of medication reduction should not only
assess possible subtle improvements in physical and cogni-
tive outcomes, but should also factor in the longitudinal
nature of polypharmacy. These studies should consider the
possibility
that
reducing
polypharmacy
earlier
in
the
course of its development, in addition to optimizing dis-
ease control, might avoid potential cumulative detrimental
effects on physical and cognitive capability noted here in
early old age.
