Abstract
Introduction: Periodontitis may add to the systemic inflammatory burden in indi-
viduals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), thereby contributing to an increased
mortality rate. This study aimed to determine the association between periodonti-
tis and mortality rate (all-cause and cardiovascular disease-related) in individuals
with stage 3–5 CKD, hitherto referred to as “CKD”.
Methods: Survival analysis was carried out using the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) and linked mortality data. Cox
proportional hazards regression was employed to assess the association between
periodontitis and mortality, in individuals with CKD. This association was com-
pared with the association between mortality and traditional risk factors in CKD
mortality (diabetes, hypertension and smoking).
Results: Of the 13,784 participants eligible for analysis in NHANES III, 861 (6%)
had CKD. The median follow-up for this cohort was 14.3 years. Adjusting for con-
founders, the 10-year all-cause mortality rate for individuals with CKD increased
from 32% (95% CI: 29–35%) to 41% (36–47%) with the addition of periodontitis.
For diabetes, the 10-year all-cause mortality rate increased to 43% (38–49%).
Conclusion: There is a strong, association between periodontitis and increased mor-
tality in individuals with CKD. Sources of chronic systemic inflammation (including
periodontitis) may be important contributors to mortality in patients with CKD.

 nized as a non-traditional risk factor
associated
with
increased
risk
of
CVD events in such patients (Menon
et al. 2005).
Severe periodontitis is the sixth
most common human disease (Kasse-
baum
et al.
2014) causing micro-
ulceration of the investing sulcular
and
pocket
lining
epithelium
of
affected teeth. The estimated surface
area
of
this
ulcerated
epithelium
approximates 40 cm2 in severe disease
(Nesse
et al.
2008).
Consequently,
individuals with periodontitis have
elevated systemic markers of acute-
phase (C-reactive protein/CRP, Inter-
leukin-6/IL-6) and oxidative stress
(peripheral neutrophil hyperactivity)
responses. This has potential systemic
consequences and co-morbid effects
that have been implicated in other
disease processes such as diabetes and
CVD
(Chapple
&
Genco
2013,
Tonetti & VanDyke 2013).
We have reported that patients
with
CKD
have
an
increase
in
prevalence of periodontitis compared
with
community
dwelling
adults
(Sharma et al. 2014). This finding is
supported
by
a
recent
systematic
review,
reporting
an
association
between periodontitis and CKD in
several populations with a combined
odds-ratio (OR) of 1.65 (95% confi-
dence interval/CI: 1.53–2.01) (Cham-
brone et al. 2013).
Successful periodontal treatment
can reduce levels of systemic inflam-
mation in patients with and without
CKD (D’Aiuto et al. 2004, Vilela
et al. 2011, Siribamrungwong et al.
2014, Fang et al. 2015). However,
the only investigations into associa-
tions between periodontitis and mor-
tality rates (all-cause and CVD) in
patients with CKD have involved
relatively small numbers of patients
(ranging from 122–253 patients) on
haemodialysis and with a short fol-
low-up
period
(ranging
from
18 months to 6 years) (Kshirsagar
et al. 2009,
Chen et al. 2011,
de
Souza et al. 2014). In epidemiologi-
cal studies reporting mortality out-
comes from non-CKD populations
some, (Garcia et al. 1998, Xu & Lu
2011, Linden et al. 2012) but not all,
(Avlund et al. 2009, Kim et al. 2013)
report a significant positive associa-
tion between periodontitis and an
increased mortality rate.
The aim of this study was to
evaluate
the
association
between
periodontitis and other traditional
risk factors (diabetes, hypertension
and smoking status) and mortality
(all-cause and CVD) in individuals
with stage 3–5 CKD, compared to
those without using robust, large-
scale, population-based data.
Materials and Methods
Data source
Data were derived from the Third
National
Health
and
Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III,
1988–1994), a representative survey
of the civilian, non-institutionalized
US
population
conducted
by
the
National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS) of the Center for Disease
Control and Prevention. Details of
the survey design and methodology
are
available
elsewhere
(NCHS,
2006a).
Briefly,
individuals
were
interviewed at home, then invited to
a mobile examination centre (MEC)
for
further
interviews,
tests
and
examinations.
Assessment of periodontal health
Details of the oral health component
of NHANES III are published else-
where (Drury et al. 1996). Briefly,
detailed
periodontal
measurements
were taken from volunteers aged 13
and over. The teeth were divided
into
two
maxillary
and
two
mandibular
halves
and
measure-
ments were taken from two sites per
tooth (mid-buccal and mesio-buccal)
for all teeth (excluding third molars)
in one randomly chosen upper and
lower quadrant. These measurements
included periodontal probing depth
(PPD), gingival recession and bleed-
ing
on
probing
(BOP).
Clinical
attachment loss (CAL) was calcu-
lated as the sum of the recession and
PPD.
Individuals
receiving
renal
replacement therapy (through dialy-
sis
or
kidney
transplant)
were
excluded from periodontal examina-
tion.
Periodontitis was defined using
the 2007 CDC/AAP (Centre for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention/Ameri-
can
Academy
of
Periodontology)
classification (Page & Eke 2007). In
addition,
continuous
periodontal
parameters were also employed such
as mean PPD, mean CAL, cumula-
tive
periodontal
probing
depth
(C-PPD), number of teeth present
and proportion of sites that bled
upon probing. Cumulative PPD was
calculated as the sum of the maxi-
mum probing pocket depths ≥4 mm
of each tooth and as such is a surro-
gate measure of the potential extent
of biofilm exposed connective tissues
(Dietrich
et al.
2008).
Edentulous
individuals
were
included
in
the
analyses but formed a group distinct
from individuals with periodontitis.
Assessment of CKD
The serum creatinine levels recorded
in the NHANES III survey were
recalibrated to be traceable to an
isotope-derived
mass
spectroscopy
method using the equation below
(NCHS, 2006b):
Standardized creatinine
¼ ð0:960 � serum creatinineÞ
� 0:18
Age, sex, ethnicity and standard-
ized serum creatinine were incorpo-
rated
in
the
CKD
Epidemiology
Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation to
calculate estimated glomerular filtra-
tion rate (eGFR) (Levey et al. 2009).
This equation improves mortality risk
stratification in individuals with CKD
compared with the Modification of
Diet in renal Disease (MDRD) equa-
tion (Shafi et al. 2012). Based on an
eGFR<60 ml/min/1.73 m2, individu-
als were classified as having stage 3–5
CKD, hitherto referred to as “CKD”.
Urinary albumin and creatinine
levels were employed to calculate the
albumin-creatinine
ratio
(ACR).
Details of the laboratory assays can
be found elsewhere (NCHS, 2006b).
Albuminuria was classified as ACR
<30 mg/g;
ACR ≥ 30 mg/g
and
<300 mg/g; and ACR ≥ 300 mg/g.
Assessment of traditional risk factors
Individuals were classed as hyperten-
sive if their mean (of three consecu-
tive
measurements)
systolic
blood
pressure (BP) was ≥140 mmHg or
mean diastolic BP was ≥90 mmHg.
Individuals were classed as dia-
betic
by
self-reporting
(excluding
gestational diabetes) or if their gly-
cated
haemoglobin
(HbA1C)
was
≥6.5%.
Individuals’ smoking status was
determined from self-reporting and

 classified
into
current,
former
or
never smokers (cigarettes only).
Covariate data
Data on covariates employed in the
statistical analyses included informa-
tion on age, sex, ethnicity (Non-
Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black,
Mexican American or Other), alco-
hol consumption (never, not in last
year,
between
0–14
drinks/week,
more than 14 drinks/week) and self-
reported history of previous cardio-
vascular events (stroke, heart attack
or heart failure). Pulse pressure was
calculated as the difference between
the mean systolic and diastolic BP.
Self- reported measures of socio-eco-
nomic
status
(household
income,
marital
status
and
educational
attainment) were coded as follows.
Household
income
(less
than
$20,000 or $20,000 or more); marital
status (married or living as married,
never married, divorced or separated
or widowed); educational attainment
(less than high school, high school
diploma or more than high school).
Body
mass
index
(BMI)
was
coded as a categorical variable with
BMI <18.5 kg/m2 as underweight;
≥ 18.5 kg/m2 and <25 kg/m2 as nor-
mal; ≥ 25 kg/m2 and <30 kg/m2 as
overweight and ≥30 kg/m2 as obese.
Laboratory
tests
including
serum
cholesterol (total and high-density
lipoprotein/HDL)
were
performed.
Serum cholesterol levels were classi-
fied
into
binary
variables
(total
serum
cholesterol
≥24 mg/L
or
<24 mg/L and serum HDL choles-
terol
≤3.5 mg/L
or
>3.5 mg/L).
Physical activity was self-reported by
individuals and reclassified as “rec-
ommended or more” if they reported
moderate activity five or more times
a week or vigorous activity three or
more times a week. Physical activity
was also classified as “recommended
or
more”
if
individuals
reported
moderate physical activity four or
more times a week and vigorous
activity one or more times a week or
reported moderate activity three or
more times a week and vigorous
activity two or more times a week.
Individuals’
physical
activity
was
classified as “none” if they reported
no leisure time physical activities.
Individuals who reported some level
of physical activity but less than rec-
ommended
were
classed
as
“less
than recommended” (Beddhu et al.
2009).
Mortality data
The NCHS provide mortality data
for NHANES III participants up to
31st December 2006, linked by prob-
abilistic record matching with the
National Death Index (NDI). The
publicly available data set contains
information on the mortality status
of individuals aged 17 years or older.
For individuals who are classified as
“assumed deceased”, information is
available on 113 underlying cause of
death categories, based on the ninth
and tenth revisions of the Interna-
tional
Classification
of
Diseases
(ICD-9 and ICD-10). CVD mortality
was
limited
to
cases
where
the
underlying cause of death was coded
between
53
and
75
(inclusive)
(Anderson et al. 2001). Details of
the linked mortality data have been
published elsewhere (NCHS, 2010).
Statistical analyses
Analyses performed followed guideli-
nes for NHANES III (NCHS, 1996),
accounting for the complex survey
design and sampling weights to yield
estimates generalizable to the US
population. Differences in categorical
and continuous data were assessed
for statistical significance using Pear-
son Chi-square, t-test, Fisher’s exact
test and analysis of variance (ANOVA)
as
appropriate.
Cox
proportional
hazards (PH) regression models were
fitted
to
evaluate
the
association
between periodontal status, traditional
risk factors (diabetes, hypertension
and smoking status) and all-cause and
CVD mortality, independent of poten-
tial confounders. The fully adjusted
model adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity,
CKD
status,
periodontal
status,
diabetic status, hypertensive status,
smoking status, pulse pressure, his-
tory of CVD (heart attack or stroke
or heart failure), alcohol consump-
tion,
ACR,
hypercholesterolaemia
and low-HDL, BMI, physical activity
and measures of socio-economic sta-
tus (household income, marital status
and educational attainment). The PH
assumption was tested using Schoen-
feld
residuals,
scaled
Schoenfeld
residuals
and
graphical
methods.
Variables were chosen to minimize
missing data. Any individuals with
missing
covariate
data
were
not
included
in
the
analyses
(listwise
deletion). Thus out of a possible
13,784 individuals eligible for analy-
ses,
1379
(10%)
individuals
were
excluded due to incomplete covariate
data (Table S1).
We considered the effect measure
modification of mortality (all-cause
and
cardiovascular)
in
individuals
with CKD according to their peri-
odontal health status. We conducted
formal tests of interaction between
periodontal variables and CKD case
definition
by
entering
interaction
terms in the model. Further formal
tests of interactions between CKD,
periodontitis or edentulism and age,
gender and ethnicity were also car-
ried out.
Analyses were carried out using
Stata/IC version 12.1 (StataCorp LP,
College Station, TX, USA).
Results
Description of whole population and
subpopulations
We analysed data from individuals
in NHANES III aged 20 years and
older with complete data on serum
creatinine,
periodontal
status
and
mortality follow-up (n = 13,784) and
with a median follow-up time of
14.3 years (mean 13.5 years, range
1 month–18.2 years). Of the 13,794
individuals included in the analyses,
861 (6%) were classified as CKD
and 12,923 as non-CKD. Individuals
with CKD were more likely to be
older,
have
different
ethnic
and
socio-economic
mix,
non-smokers
(never
or
ex-
smokers),
diabetic,
hypertensive, with higher total serum
cholesterol and lower levels of serum
HDL, report lower levels of physical
activity and consume less alcohol
and report a history of CVD (stroke,
heart attack and congestive heart
failure) compared to those without
CKD. Individuals with CKD were
more likely to suffer from periodon-
titis (or be edentulous) and have
fewer teeth compared to individuals
without CKD. When examining con-
tinuous
variables
of
periodontal
health,
patients
with
CKD
were
more likely to have a greater mean
CAL and greater BOP (Table 1).
Among individuals
with CKD,
those with periodontitis were more
likely to be older, of non-white eth-

Periodontitis and mortality in CKD

 nicity, current smokers, diabetic and
hypertensive and have a lower eGFR
compared to periodontally healthy
individuals. These individuals also
had lower household incomes and
educational attainments compared to
periodontally
healthy
individuals.
Periodontally
healthy
individuals
were similar to those with periodon-
titis in terms of their sex, alcohol
consumption, marital status, physical
activity, history of CVD events and
BMI (Table 1).
All-cause mortality
After adjusting for covariates, indi-
viduals with CKD had a 44% (95%
CI: 28–63%) increased rate of all-
cause mortality compared to those
without CKD (Table 2). Individuals
with periodontitis had a 36% (22–
51%)
increased
rate
of
all-cause
mortality compared to individuals
who were periodontally healthy.
The association between periodon-
titis and all-cause mortality was simi-
lar
between
individuals
with
or
without CKD (p-value for interac-
tion = 0.57). Similarly, the associa-
tions between CKD and all-cause
mortality did not vary by age, sex or
diabetes status (p-values for interac-
tion 0.14, 0.99 and 0.09 respectively).
Furthermore, the association between
periodontitis and all-cause mortality
did not vary by age, gender or dia-
betes status (p-values for interaction
0.73, 0.51 and 0.51 respectively). In
edentulous individuals, there was a
significant difference in all-cause mor-
tality by age. Edentulous individuals
under the age of 65 had a significantly
increased rate of all-cause mortality
compared to edentulous individuals
65 years and older, hazard ratio (HR)
1.85 (1.41–2.44) and 1.18 (1.04–1.33)
respectively
(Tables
S2,
S3
and
Fig. S1).
For continuous measures of peri-
odontitis in fully adjusted models,
an increased mortality rate was seen
with worsening periodontal health
in a dose-dependent manner. For
example a 1 mm increase in mean
PPD was associated with a 17% (6–
28%) increase in incident rate of
all-cause mortality (Table 2). Eden-
tulousness
was
associated
with
a
32% (17–50%) increased rate of all-
cause
mortality
compared
with
periodontally
healthy
dentate
individuals.
Diabetes
(HR
1.41;
1.27–1.57),
hypertension (HR 1.06; 0.93–1.20)
and
current
smoking
(HR
2.12;
1.82–2.48) were associated with an
increased rate of all-cause mortality
although this increase was not signif-
icant for hypertension (Table 2).
The 10-year all-cause mortality
for individuals with CKD (but with-
out periodontitis or other traditional
risk
factors)
was
32%
(29–35%).
Addition of periodontitis to the risk
profile increased 10-year mortality to
41%
(36–47%).
This
increase
in
mortality was comparable with that
seen in individuals with CKD who
had diabetes instead of periodontitis
(43%; 38–49%). A similar cumula-
tive effect on mortality is seen with
periodontitis and other traditional
risk factors (Table 3). These esti-
mates are based on the demographic
features of individuals with CKD
within NHANES III (e.g. a mean
age of 73 years). Estimated survival
curves
for
individuals
with
CKD
and different risk factor profiles is
given in Fig. 1.
Cardiovascular mortality
After
adjusting
for
covariates,
individuals with CKD had a 60%
(32–95%)
increased
rate
of
CVD
mortality compared to those without
CKD (Table 2), independent of con-
founders specified. Individuals with
periodontitis had a 38% (16–65%)
increased
rate
of
CVD
mortality
compared to individuals who were
periodontally healthy. The associa-
tion between periodontitis and CVD

There was a trend in patients with

not significant. In edentulous indi-
viduals, there was a significant dif-

Discussion
In this large cohort, representative
of the US population from which it
was derived, CKD was associated
with
increased
rates
of
all-cause
mortality and CVD mortality, inde-
pendent of periodontitis, traditional
risk factors and other confounders.
Periodontitis
was
associated
with
increased rates of all-cause and CVD
mortality comparable with, but inde-
pendent of, that associated with dia-
betes
(Tables 2–4;
Figs 1
and
2).
There was an increased rate of all-
cause mortality but not CVD mor-
tality in edentulous individuals with
CKD compared with periodontally
healthy
dentate
individuals.
The
association between edentulousness
and CVD mortality was significant
in a subgroup of edentulous individ-
uals under the age of 65. Given the
high prevalence of chronic periodon-
titis in patients with CKD (Cham-
brone
et al.
2013),
our
results
suggest that periodontitis may be an
important non-traditional risk factor
for CVD and all-cause mortality in
these patients, and interestingly con-
tributing to the increased risk to a
similar extent as diabetes.
The strengths of this study are its
large
population-based
sampling
with robust sampling methodology
which allow the results from this
analysis to be generalized to the US
population.
The
detailed
clinical,
demographic and anthropomorphic
data collected allows for many of
the
known
covariates
to
be
accounted for in the Cox propor-
tional hazards regression model, gen-
erating
more
accurate
point
estimates. The length of follow-up
for this study is its final strength and
allows for the pragmatic assessment
of long term, hard outcomes (all-
cause
and
CVD
mortality).

 limitations
of
this
study
include
the lack of longitudinal examination
of
individuals.
Unfortunately,
in
NHANES, the longitudinal data is
limited to the mortality status of
patients derived from the National
Death Index. Data on variables were
only gathered at inception and there-
fore changes in variables (periodon-
tal, diabetes, smoking status, etc) are
not
ascertainable.
Analyses
were
carried out on the assumption that
characteristics
did
not
change
between inception and time to death
or censoring. Some individuals with
periodontitis
are
likely
to
have
received treatment and/or lost teeth
during follow-up, resulting in disease
misclassification over time. Further-
more,
periodontal
measurements
from NHANES III are known to
underestimate the prevalence of peri-
odontitis
by
13.4%
(absolute)
or
60% (relative) (Eke et al. 2010). The
results of this study may therefore
under-estimate
the
association
between periodontitis and mortality
in CKD. Also, as with any multi-
variable regression analysis, the issue
of residual confounding from inaccu-
rate measurement or categorization
of variables or confounding from
variables not included in the analysis
cannot be ruled out.
Previous studies investigating the
link
between
mortality
and
peri-
odontitis in patients with CKD have
done so in patients on haemodialysis
(Kshirsagar et al. 2009, Chen et al.
2011, de Souza et al. 2014). Apart
from the small sample sizes (122–253
patients) and shorter follow-up per-
iod (18 months to 6 years), these
studies differed significantly from the
present analysis as individuals receiv-
ing RRT (through chronic dialysis
or a functioning kidney transplant)
were not included in the present
analysis (RRT was an exclusion cri-
teria for periodontal examination in
NHANES III). Hence, even though
these studies demonstrate an associa-
tion between periodontitis and mor-
tality, thereby lending support to the
current findings, the results cannot
be directly compared.
A putative mechanism for a pos-
sible link between periodontitis and
increased all-cause and CVD mortal-
ity
is
via
the
increased
systemic
acute-phase and oxidative stress bur-
den. This increased burden is seen in
individuals
with
periodontitis
and
CKD (Ioannidou et al. 2011) and
individuals with periodontitis who
do not have CKD (D’Aiuto et al.
2004,
Chapple
&
Genco
2013).
Increased systemic inflammatory and
oxidative stress burdens increase the
incidence of CVD events in patients
with CKD (Arici & Walls 2001,
Mathew et al. 2008, Li et al. 2015).
This mechanism is supported by the
association
demonstrated
here
between increased risk of CVD mor-
tality and measures of active peri-
odontitis
(periodontitis
case
definition, mean PPD and BOP), as
opposed to measures of historical
periodontitis
(edentulousness
and
mean CAL), where there was a lack
of association (Table 2). However, at
least part of the association between
periodontitis and CVD may also be
due to common risk factors such as
smoking and diabetes (Dietrich et al.
2008,
Mucci
et al.
2009).
The
increase
in
all-cause
mortality
in
edentulous individuals compared to
periodontally healthy dentate indi-
viduals, as reported here and also by
other
investigators
in
non-CKD
cohorts (Brown 2009), may be due
to several factors. Patients are ren-
dered edentulous for a variety of
reasons including periodontitis, with
approximately 50% of teeth being
extracted due to periodontal disease
(Phipps & Stevens 1995). As approx-
imately half of all tooth extractions
are for reasons other than periodon-
tal disease, edentulousness may act
as a surrogate marker of general
health attitudes and/or behaviours,
limited healthcare access or other
socio-economic measures (Joshipura
& Ritchie 2005). This might also
explain
the
association
between
edentulousness and CVD mortality
in patients under the age of 65 who
might have such characteristics and
attitudes
towards
healthcare
that
render them edentulous before the
age of 65.
The
biological
mechanisms
underpinning
the
relationship
between periodontitis and increased
mortality in individuals with CKD
form a promising area of research
and may produce mechanistic targets
leading
to
risk
stratification
and
novel interventions. Ongoing longi-
tudinal studies (Stringer et al. 2013)
investigating
large
cohorts
of
patients with pre-dialysis CKD may
provide confirmation of this associa-
tion and shed light upon explanatory
mechanisms. Successful treatment of
periodontitis
has
been
shown
to
improve surrogate markers of CVD
risk, including serum markers of sys-
temic
inflammation
(CRP,
IL-6)
(D’Aiuto
et al.
2004),
endothelial
function
as
measured
by
flow-
mediated
dilatation
(FMD)
and
endothelial-activation markers such
as soluble E-selectin and von Wille-
brand factor (Tonetti et al. 2007).
Two randomized controlled trials of
periodontal interventions in patients
with CKD have been carried out but
limited to cohorts of haemodialysis
patients. These have produced con-
flicting results either not demonstrat-
ing changes in inflammatory markers
following
periodontal
intervention
(Wehmeyer et al. 2013) or demon-
strating that significant reductions in
inflammatory
markers
can
be
achieved following periodontal ther-
apy (Fang et al. 2015). Currently,
patients with CKD are managed to
strict targets concerning glycaemic
control
(diabetes)
and
control
of
hypertension and smoking cessation
to improve outcomes. If a causal
link is established between periodon-
titis and increased rates of adverse
outcomes
in
CKD
patients,
then
establishing
and
maintaining
peri-
odontal
health
may
become
an
important part of the care pathway
of patients with CKD.

Clinical Relevance
Scientific rationale for the study:
CKD prevalence and complications
cannot
be
entirely
explained
by
traditional
risk
factors
such
as
diabetes or cardiovascular disease
(CVD).
Periodontitis
is
indepen-
dently associated with CKD and
contributes to the systemic inflam-
matory burden, therefore this study
aimed to establish the association
between periodontitis and mortality
in patients with chronic kidney dis-
ease (CKD).
Principal findings: Periodontitis was
associated with a 9% (absolute) or
28% (relative) increase in all-cause
mortality at 10 years for individuals
with CKD, within the limitation of
this analysis. This association is of a
similar magnitude, but independent
of, that seen between diabetes and
mortality in individuals with CKD.
Practical implications: Periodontitis
may be an important predictor of
mortality in patients with CKD
and sources of chronic inflamma-
tion (including periodontitis) may
be important contributors beyond
traditional risk factors in patients
with CKD.
