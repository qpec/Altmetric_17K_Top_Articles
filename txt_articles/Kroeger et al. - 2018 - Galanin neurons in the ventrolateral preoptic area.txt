The preoptic area (POA) is necessary for sleep, but the fundamental POA circuits have
remained elusive. Previous studies showed that galanin (GAL)- and GABA-producing neu-
rons in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) express cFos after periods of increased
sleep and innervate key wake-promoting regions. Although lesions in this region can produce
insomnia, high frequency photostimulation of the POAGAL neurons was shown to para-
doxically cause waking, not sleep. Here we report that photostimulation of VLPOGAL neurons
in mice promotes sleep with low frequency stimulation (1–4 Hz), but causes conduction block
and waking at frequencies above 8 Hz. Further, optogenetic inhibition reduces sleep. Che-
mogenetic activation of VLPOGAL neurons confirms the increase in sleep, and also reduces
body temperature. In addition, chemogenetic activation of VLPOGAL neurons induces short-
latency sleep in an animal model of insomnia. Collectively, these findings establish a causal
role of VLPOGAL neurons in both sleep induction and heat loss.

1234567890():,;
 A
lmost a century ago, von Economo discovered that
patients with injury to the rostral hypothalamus often had
unrelenting
insomnia1.
Subsequent
animal
research
showed that lesions of the preoptic area (POA) reduced sleep2–4
whereas stimulation increased sleep5–8. However, the specific
circuits constituting this preoptic sleep-inducing area remained
unknown. Sherin et al. identified a cluster of neurons in the
ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) and scattered neurons in
the adjacent ventromedial and dorsolateral preoptic area (the
extended VLPO) of rats that express cFos during sleep and
project
to
the
wake-promoting
tuberomammillary
nucleus
(TMN)9,10. About 85% of these neurons contain the inhibitory
neurotransmitters galanin (GAL) and GABA9,10; similar obser-
vations in other species confirmed that most sleep-active neurons
in the VLPO and extended VLPO are galaninergic and form a
single population, referred to here as the VLPOGAL neurons11.
Lesions in this region in rodents reduce sleep by 40–50%12–14. In
humans, loss-of-VLPOGAL neurons is associated with sleep
fragmentation and fewer bouts of consolidated sleep15.
Although GAL is a specific marker for sleep-active neurons in
the VLPO and extended VLPO in rats, in mice about 20% of all
VLPOGAL cells are active during wake11. In addition, a recent
optogenetic study found that photostimulation of POAGAL neu-
rons at 10 Hz failed to increase sleep and surprisingly increased
wake16. These results call into question whether POAGAL neurons
promote sleep.
In addition to sleep regulation, the POA is also a key site for
thermoregulation17–19.
Large
preoptic
lesions
cause
hyperthermia3,20, whereas photoactivation of specific POA neu-
rons causes profound hypothermia (4–6 °C)21–23. Interestingly,
many sleep-active VLPO neurons are also activated by increased
skin or body temperature (Tb), and may drive reductions in Tb,
demonstrating
the tight
coupling of
sleep
and
heat loss
pathways24,25. However, it is unknown whether VLPOGAL neu-
rons contribute to thermoregulation.
To determine the specific role of VLPOGAL neurons in sleep
and thermoregulation, we selectively activated and inhibited
VLPOGAL neurons in mice. We find that activation of VLPOGAL
neurons promotes sleep even in an animal model of insomnia.
Conversely, inhibition of VLPOGAL neurons reduces NREM sleep
and increases wake. Interestingly, chemoactivation of VLPOGAL
neurons also causes profound hypothermia, indicating that
VLPOGAL neurons can also promote heat loss.
Results
Distribution of GAL neurons in the POA. We first investigated
the distribution of GAL neurons in the POA of GAL-IRES-Cre::
L10-GFP mice (Methods). In rats and humans, POAGAL neu-
rons are predominantly found in three major clusters, including
the VLPO and extended VLPO; the medial preoptic nucleus;
and the supraoptic nucleus11. We found that in mice, a larger
proportion of the VLPOGAL neurons is located in the dorsal
extended VLPO. The cluster of GAL neurons in the medial
preoptic nucleus is less dense than in rats, but there are many
more small (15–20 µm) GAL-expressing neurons that extend
along the wall of the third ventricle and into the median pre-
optic nucleus (Supplementary Fig. 1). There are very few GAL-
expressing magnocellular supraoptic neurons at the levels of the
POA studied here. Further, the entire POA in a mouse is so
small that these cell groups, which are quite distinct in larger
species, appear to be crowded together, with a tendency to
overlap at the edges. Thus, identifying GAL-expressing cell
groups involved in a specific function requires careful histolo-
gical examination.
VLPOGAL neurons innervate wake and thermoregulatory cen-
ters. To determine whether VLPOGAL neurons influence brain
regions that regulate sleep-wake behavior and Tb, we unilaterally
microinjected the VLPO of GAL-IRES-cre mice (n = 8) with a
Cre-dependent adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) coding for
channelrhodospsin-2 (ChR2) and mCherry (AAV8-EF1α-DIO-
ChR2-mCherry, hereafter ‘AAV-ChR2’)26–28. Six weeks later, we
immunolabeled the brain sections for mCherry. We analyzed the
projections of 3 cases in which the bulk of the injection involved
the three VLPOGAL populations, with little or no involvement of
the periventricular, median, or medial preoptic nuclei. Similar to
the pattern in rats10, we found a high density of mCherry-labeled
terminals in wake-promoting regions, including the lateral
hypothalamic area (LH), TMN, pedunculopontine tegmental
nucleus (PPT), lateral and medial parabrachial nucleus (PB) and
locus coeruleus (LC). We also observed intense mCherry-labeled
terminal fields in the ventrolateral and lateral periaqueductal gray
matter (lPAG) and the adjacent lateral pontine tegmentum, a key
region for REM sleep regulation29. In addition, labeled axons
were dense in the dorsal hypothalamic area (DHA) and dor-
somedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH), the raphe pallidus (RPa),
and parapyramidal region (PPR) in the rostral medulla, regions
essential for thermoregulation17,18. These results indicate that
VLPOGAL neurons have projections that may allow them to
influence many brain regions that regulate both sleep-wake
behavior and Tb.
Photoactivation of VLPOGAL neurons increases NREM sleep.
To determine whether VLPOGAL neurons can promote sleep, we
injected AAV-ChR2 bilaterally into the VLPO of GAL-IRES-Cre
mice (‘VLPOGAL-ChR2 mice’) and implanted bilateral optical
fibers in the POA27 (Fig. 1a). We also placed electrodes for
recording the electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram
(EMG), and intraperitoneally implanted a telemetry transmitter
for recording Tb30,31. As negative controls, we injected GAL-
IRES-cre mice with an AAV without ChR2 (AAV-EF1α-DIO-
mCherry, ‘AAV-mCherry’). As expected, preoptic injections of
either AAV resulted in robust and specific expression of ChR2-
mCherry in VLPOGAL neurons, consistent with the distribution
of GAL neurons in GAL-IRES-cre::L10-GFP reporter mice
(Fig. 1b, c Supplementary Fig. 1). AAV-ChR2 injections in wild-
type (WT) littermates did not result in any expression of
mCherry.
In vitro, whole cell, current clamp recordings from ChR2-
expressing GAL neurons in POA slices indicated that 10 ms blue
light pulses at stimulation frequencies ≤2 Hz evoked single action
potentials and entrained VLPO neurons in a temporally precise
manner with each light pulse evoking a full action potential
(crossing 0 mV level) for the entire duration of a 60 s stimulation
train (Fig. 2a, b). Similarly, in vivo, low frequency photostimula-
tion (1 Hz, 10 ms duration) for 2 h increased cFos expression in
VLPO and extended VLPO ChR2-expressing neurons. Identical
stimulation in VLPOGAL-mCherry mice did not increase cFos
expression (Fig. 1c).
During spontaneous sleep, VLPO neurons typically fire at only
2–5 Hz25,32, and we found that VLPOGAL neurons cannot entrain
to higher frequency photostimulation in vitro. At stimulation
frequencies >2 Hz, the peak of the photo-evoked excitatory
response, fell below 0 mV, at which point it likely failed to elicit
action potentials. While 75% of 4 Hz stimulations triggered action
potentials, at 8 and 16 Hz, only the first light pulses evoked an
action potential while the following light flashes evoked only
excitatory potentials, indicating depolarization block (Fig. 2a, b).

 continuously for 2 h (from 21:00 h to 23:00 h; 2 h after dark onset)
and recorded sleep-wake parameters and Tb for 2 h before, during
and after stimulation. Consistent with our hypothesis, photo-
stimulation at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 Hz substantially (>60%) increased
NREM sleep when compared to sham stimulation in the same
mice as well as photostimulation at the same frequencies in
VLPOGAL-mCherry mice (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table 1),
but these stimulations did not affect REM sleep (Supplementary
Fig. 2k). Behaviorally, mice with low frequency stimulation (0.5–4
Hz) reduced locomotor activity, assumed a sleep posture within
their nest and transitioned into sleep. To determine whether the
increase in NREM sleep depended on the duration of light pulses,
we photostimulated VLPOGAL neurons at 1 Hz and varied the
duration of light pulses (5, 10, 20, and 50 ms). We found that 10
ms pulses increased NREM sleep slightly more efficiently than
either shorter or longer pulses (Supplementary Fig. 2h).
AAV injections in VLPOGAL-ChR2 mice included GAL
neurons in the VLPO (including the dorsal and medial extended
VLPO), but also in the medial, median, and periventricular
preoptic nuclei in most cases (Fig. 1b). However, a comparison of
the different injection sites shows that the mice with the greatest
increases in NREM sleep during stimulation (e.g., cases 832, 833,
and 888) had injection sites involving the largest part of the
VLPO core and the medial and dorsal extended VLPO, whereas
mice with lesser increases in sleep (e.g., 830, 1141) typically had
less extensive involvement of the VLPO and extended VLPO. In
contrast, some mice with large increases in sleep had minimal
involvement of the medial, median, or periventricular preoptic
GAL neurons (e.g. 832, 888). In addition, in all of these
experiments, the optical fiber tips were laterally placed in the
dorsal extended VLPO, about 200–400 µm dorsal to the VLPO
cluster (Supplementary Fig. 2j). As in our previous work23, we
found that photoactivation resulted in cFos expression only in an
area extending about 1 mm ventral to the tip, i.e., the VLPO and
extended VLPO neurons, and did not activate neurons in the
medial, median, or periventricular preoptic populations.

 We then analyzed sleep architecture and EEG power spectra in
mice with 1 Hz stimulations with 10 ms pulse duration, as these
parameters increased NREM sleep more efficiently. We found
that the photo-evoked increase in NREM sleep was primarily due
to more NREM sleep bouts rather than longer bouts (Supple-
mentary Table 1), suggesting a role for VLPOGAL neurons in
facilitating wake-to-NREM transitions. Interestingly, the EEG
showed high voltage slow waves entrained to the frequency of
stimulation, or its harmonics (i.e., 1, 2, and 4 Hz; Supplementary
Fig. 3) during wake, NREM sleep and REM sleep, resulting in an
apparent increase in delta power (Fig. 2d, e and Supplementary
Table 1). Identical light pulses in VLPOGAL-mCherry mice did
not affect the EEG spectrum (Supplementary Table 1). The
mechanism for entraining cortical EEG to VLPO firing may
involve rhythmic inhibition of wake-promoting neurons.
Although, we observed slow waves entrained to the photo-
stimulation frequency during wake and REM sleep (Fig. 2d), the
different states were still clearly distinguishable both electro-
physiologically and on video. Moreover, the increase in NREM
sleep during photostimulation of VLPOGAL neurons was followed
by a period of ‘rebound-wake’, i.e. an increase in wake across the
2 h after stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 2a-g), suggesting that
the induced sleep fulfilled the homeostatic qualities of natural
sleep. Collectively, these observations indicate that VLPOGAL
neurons promote NREM sleep mainly by initiating sleep and
increasing transitions from wake into NREM sleep.
Importantly, and in contrast to low frequency stimulation,
higher frequency photostimulation (8 and 16 Hz) of VLPOGAL
neurons did not increase NREM sleep (Fig. 2c). Our in vitro
recordings showed depolarization block with high frequency
stimulations, and in vivo, 16 Hz photostimulation actually
increased wakefulness and exploratory activity similar to a prior
study16 in 7 out of 10 mice (three mice which did not display
wake after 8 or 16 Hz stimulations had comparatively smaller
preoptic injections). Thus, high frequency photostimulation of
VLPOGAL neurons may induce depolarization block, disinhibit-
ing the arousal systems and paradoxically increasing wakefulness.
Finally, although low frequency (1 Hz) stimulation slightly
decreased Tb (~0.5 °C), overall, neither low nor high frequency
stimulations altered Tb during the 2 h recording period when
compared to sham stimulation in the same mice (Supplementary
Fig. 2i).

 Photoinhibition of VLPOGAL neurons decreases NREM sleep.
To study whether VLPOGAL neurons are necessary for sleep, we
injected
AAV-CAG-Flex-ArchT-GFP
(‘AAV-ArchT’)33
bilat-
erally into the VLPO of GAL-IRES-Cre mice (‘VLPOGAL-ArchT
mice’) as above (Fig. 3a). AAV-ArchT resulted in specific
expression of ArchT-GFP in VLPOGAL neurons, consistent with
the distribution of GAL neurons in GAL-IRES-Cre::L10-GFP
reporter mice (Supplementary Fig. 1). In the 7 mice used for the
experiments, the AAV injections covered an average of 47.2%
(range: 37.8–68.5%) of the VLPO.
In vitro, whole-cell current clamp recordings from ArchT-
expressing GAL neurons in VLPO slices showed that yellow/
orange laser light for 5 min hyperpolarized VLPOGAL neurons
and completely prevented action potential firing during the
illumination period (Fig. 3b). After the photoinhibition, action
potentials resumed at the pre-illumination rate in all neurons
(Fig. 3b).
We then measured the sleep-wake effects of photoinhibition of
VLPOGAL neurons (5 min continuous light every 30 min for 24 h)
(Fig. 3c, d and Supplementary Fig. 4a-d). After ~2 min latency,
the percentage time spent in wake gradually climbed from about
47% to about 60% at the end of the 5 min photoinhibition. Wake
levels remained in that range for about 5 more min, before
gradually returning to baseline. We compared the percentages of
sleep-wake states during the 5 min periods immediately prior
(‘pre’), during (‘during’), and after (‘post’) laser inhibition or
sham inhibition. Over the entire 24-h period, the time spent in
NREM sleep was decreased during the 5 min post laser inhibition
when compared to the pre-laser inhibition (14.8 ± 2% reduction;
‘pre’ vs. ‘post’: p = 0.0141, one-way repeated measures (RM)
ANOVA; Supplementary Fig. 4a). The decrease in NREM sleep
was more pronounced during the dark period (27.6 ± 5%
reduction, ‘pre’ vs. ‘post’: p = 0.0027, one-way RM ANOVA;
Fig. 3c) and was accompanied by a proportional increase in wake
(Supplementary Table 2). These changes in NREM sleep and
wake were mainly due to longer wake bouts (Supplementary
Table 2), suggesting that photoinhibition reduced initiation of
NREM sleep. REM sleep levels did not differ (Fig. 3c). In contrast
to photoinhibition, sham inhibition had no effect on wake,
NREM or REM sleep in the same mice (Fig. 3d; Supplementary
Fig. 4b,d). These data indicate that acute inhibition of VLPOGAL
neurons increases wake by reducing transitions into NREM sleep.
Chemogenetic activation induces sleep and hypothermia.
Although optogenetics offers many advantages, photostimulation
may induce firing patterns that differ from natural patterns. We
therefore sought to corroborate our optogenetic findings with
chemogenetic experiments, which are also more suitable for long-
term stimulation. We bilaterally injected AAV8-hsyn-DIO-
hM3Dq-mCherry (‘AAV-hM3Dq’)34,35 into the VLPO of GAL-
Cre mice (‘VLPOGAL-hM3Dq mice’; Fig. 4a) and implanted a
telemetry transmitter to record EEG, EMG, Tb, and locomotion35.
AAV-hM3Dq injections resulted in specific expression of hM3Dq
(as evidenced by mCherry labeling) in POAGAL neurons (Fig. 4b,
c). In some mice, the injections were sufficiently laterally placed
that they involved neurons only in the VLPO and extended
VLPO, avoiding the medial, median, and periventricular preoptic
nuclei. We therefore examined the responses in that group

 separately, to see whether they differed from the cases where the
more medial, small celled preoptic GAL-expressing neurons were
also involved. Injection of AAV-hM3Dq in WT littermates (not
expressing Cre) resulted in no mCherry expression. We also used
GAL-IRES-Cre mice injected with AAV-DIO-mCherry in the
VLPO (VLPOGAL-mCherry mice) as negative controls.
In whole cell, current clamp recordings in vitro, bath
application of CNO depolarized (10.5 ± 2.9 mV; −52.9 ± 3.2 mV

hM3Dq-expressing VLPOGAL neurons and increased firing rates
(0.7 ± 0.1 impulses/s post CNO vs. 0.03 impulses/s pre-CNO; p =
0.001, paired t-test; Fig. 4d). In vivo, CNO (0.3 mg/kg i.p.)
increased cFos expression (Fig. 4c) in hM3Dq-expressing neurons
in the VLPO, indicating that CNO activated hM3Dq-expressing
GAL neurons.
To assess changes in sleep-wake behavior and Tb with
chemoactivation of VLPOGAL neurons, we injected CNO (0.3
mg/kg, i.p.) or saline (vehicle) at the onset of the dark period and
early in the light period. Administration of CNO at dark onset
(19:00 h) increased NREM sleep 71% over the next 4 h when
compared to saline, while CNO injection at 10:00 h increased
NREM sleep 21% during the first 12 h (three bins of 4 h each)
(Fig. 5a, b and Supplementary Fig. 5). This increase in NREM
sleep was due to a substantial increase in the number (but not the
duration) of NREM sleep bouts, further demonstrating that

 NREM transitions (Supplementary Fig. 5e-h,). Unlike photo-
stimulation, which entrained the EEG to the frequency of the
laser bursts, CNO did not alter the EEG spectrum during NREM
sleep (Supplementary Fig. 5c,d). In contrast to the increase in
NREM sleep, REM sleep was suppressed by 66% and 71% during
the first 8 h post CNO in the dark and light periods, respectively,
and this REM sleep suppression was accompanied by longer
latencies to enter REM sleep (Fig. 5c, d). None of these sleep-wake
changes were observed in control GAL-IRES-Cre mice that
received an AAV encoding only mCherry (Supplementary Fig. 6).
In
addition
to
sleep-wake
changes,
chemoactivation
of
hM3Dq-expressing VLPOGAL neurons markedly reduced Tb
during both the light and dark periods. Tb began to drop 5–10
min after CNO injections, fell ~4–6°C within ~2 h, and then
returned to baseline levels after 12–14 h (Fig. 5e, f). As this
hypothermia was not observed with photostimulation which
predominantly activated GAL neurons in the lateral POA (optical
fiber tips were mainly dorsal to the VLPO cluster; Supplementary
Fig. 2j), we examined whether differences in the injection sites in
optogenetic and chemogenetic experiments could contribute to
this hypothermic response. Examination of the injection sites that
caused the greatest fall in temperature showed that many of them
were confined to the core and dorsal extended VLPO, with little
or no involvement of the medial, median, or periventricular
preoptic GAL neurons (e.g., cases 757, 808). As expected, these
cases were also among those showing the greatest increase in

 NREM sleep after CNO administration. The percentage increase
in NREM sleep positively correlated with the magnitude of fall in
Tb (Fig. 5g, i). Conversely, the percentage change in REM sleep
negatively correlated with the magnitude of hypothermia (Fig. 5h,
j). Although we did not test whether the same individual neurons
cause both the fall in Tb and changes in sleep, it appears that both
responses are caused by activation of a single population of
VLPOGAL neurons.
We were also concerned, in light of recent reports that CNO
may be converted to clozapine in vivo36, whether CNO injection
could cause hypothermia by itself, but it failed to do so in GAL-
IRES-Cre mice injected with AAV-mCherry (Supplementary
Fig.
6j,l).
It
is
therefore
more
likely
that
the
profound
hypothermia is due to differences in firing rate/pattern of
VLPOGAL neurons with chemoactivation (vs. photoactivation)
that caused different downstream responses such as release of
other neurotransmitters/peptides.
Chemoactivation of VLPOGAL neurons at different ambient
temperatures. Sleep and thermoregulation are closely intertwined
in many ways37–40. For example, Tb normally falls about 1 °C
during sleep in mice41. On the other hand, severe hypothermia
may promote arousal, fragment NREM sleep, reduce EEG delta
power during NREM sleep, and suppress REM sleep37–39,42. We
therefore hypothesized that chemoactivation of VLPOGAL neu-
rons would more strongly increase the quantity and quality of
sleep (more consolidated sleep bouts, increased EEG delta power
during NREM, and more REM sleep) if the mice were provided
with ‘thermal comfort’ by exposure to an ambient temperature
(Ta) that would blunt the fall in Tb. To test this hypothesis, we
chemogenetically activated VLPOGAL neurons in mice housed at
thermoneutral (29 °C) or warm Ta (36 °C, empirically determined
to prevent the fall in Tb, Fig. 6a).
As predicted, CNO injections produced larger increases in
NREM sleep at both 29 °C and 36 °C compared to 22 °C or
injections of saline (Fig. 6c; Supplementary Fig. 7). Surprisingly, a
Ta of 29 °C, which is generally thought to be near thermoneutral
for mice, did not prevent the hypothermia due to CNO, and only
at a Ta of 36 °C was the CNO-induced hypothermia completely
prevented (Fig. 6b). The amount of NREM sleep after CNO at Ta
36 °C was substantially greater and the NREM sleep latency was
shorter than with CNO injections at Ta 22 °C (Fig. 6c, d) while the
mice at Ta of 29 °C showed intermediate responses. CNO also
increased NREM EEG delta power at Ta 36 °C (Fig. 6e) when
compared to CNO at Ta 29 °C, suggesting deeper sleep at higher
Ta.
In contrast, CNO given at dark onset suppressed REM sleep at
all Ta (Fig. 6f). Whether this was due to activation of VLPOGAL
neurons is difficult to determine as REM sleep is generally low
during the dark period, and high Ta alone can suppress REM
sleep43. To address these issues, we administered CNO or saline
to VLPOGAL-hM3Dq mice at 29 °C during the light period when
REM sleep is more abundant. We found that CNO decreased
REM sleep during the first 4 hours at 29 °C, but REM sleep rose
quickly during the next 12 h until it was fully recovered.
Cumulative REM sleep amounts in the 16 h post CNO were
higher than at Ta 22 °C and were comparable to post-saline data
at Ta 22 °C or Ta 29 °C (Fig. 6g). These results indicate that a Ta of
29 °C, which does not prevent hypothermia or initial REM sleep
loss, can rescue REM sleep amounts by enhancing REM sleep
rebound after hypothermia.
Activation of POAGAL neurons attenuates sleep-onset insom-
nia. To explore the translational relevance of our findings for
insomnia patients, we examined whether chemoactivation of
VLPOGAL neurons can improve sleep in an animal model of
insomnia. Acute exposure to a novel environment (e.g. transfer to
the new cage) reduces sleep in mice for 3–4 h, akin to sleep-onset
insomnia in humans44. Therefore, we administered saline or
CNO to VLPOGAL-hM3Dq mice at 10:00 h (3 h into the light
period; at 22 °C) and immediately transferred them to a new cage
(similar to home cage) with fresh bedding and nesting material
(Fig. 7a). CNO injections increased NREM sleep about threefold
during the first 4 h compared to saline treatment (Fig. 7b and
Supplementary Fig. 8c) and also significantly shortened NREM
sleep latencies (Fig. 7c and Supplementary Fig. 8d). In addition,
the hyperthermia usually associated with exposure to a new cage
was attenuated by CNO (Fig. 7d and Supplementary Fig. 8g). On
the other hand, the hypothermia observed after CNO treatment
in the home cage was still present, albeit with a lower magnitude.
These findings indicate that activation of VLPOGAL neurons can
attenuate sleep-onset insomnia and hyperthermia induced by the
stress of a novel environment.
Discussion
Although, the role of the POA in sleep has been recognized for
decades, the neurochemical identity of sleep-promoting neurons
has remained controversial. Based on cFos expression and pro-
jections to the TMN9–11, GAL neurons in the VLPO (including
the extended VLPO) have been suspected to play a critical role in
the regulation of NREM sleep. Although lesions of the VLPO in
rats dramatically reduced sleep time12–14, and loss-of-VLPOGAL
neurons in humans with age is associated with fragmentation and
loss-of-consolidated sleep15, it remained unclear if VLPOGAL
neurons
actually
promote
sleep16.

 activation of VLPOGAL neurons increases NREM sleep and their
inhibition decreases NREM sleep, thereby establishing a pivotal
role for VLPOGAL neurons in sleep promotion. NREM sleep with
photoactivation of VLPOGAL neurons resembled normal sleep
behaviorally; mice reduced locomotor activity in preparation for
sleep, assumed a sleep posture within their nest and transitioned
into sleep. In addition, chemoactivation of VLPOGAL neurons
produced severe hypothermia, highlighting the close connection
between NREM sleep and heat loss. Although our experiments
did not address whether individual VLPOGAL neurons con-
tributed to both, the neurons contributing to these functions are
at least intermixed, as different injections involved different
proportions of the VLPO core and the dorsal and medial
extended VLPOGAL neurons, but the amount of sleep and
hypothermia correlated across the entire set of experiments.
At first glance, our results may appear to contradict a recent
report by Chung et al. that 10 Hz optogenetic activation of
VLPOGAL neurons causes wakefulness, rather than sleep16.
However, VLPO sleep-active neurons generally fire no faster than
2–5 Hz, even during deep NREM sleep16,25,32. We find that
VLPOGAL neurons fire reliably with low frequency photo-
stimulation (0.5–4 Hz) in vitro, and in vivo photostimulation at
these frequencies clearly increases NREM sleep. In contrast,
higher frequency stimulation (8 or 16 Hz) causes depolarization
block in vitro, and in vivo these frequencies either decrease or
have no effect on NREM sleep. We suspect that the wakefulness
with 10 Hz photostimulation in the prior study16 was caused by
conduction block and acute silencing of VLPOGAL neurons.
Interestingly, Chung et al. also photostimulated POA neurons
at 10 Hz that had transported ChR2-AAV retrogradely from the
TMN, and found that they promote sleep16. Most of these are

 likely to have been VLPOGAL neurons, as about 85% of preoptic
neurons retrogradely labeled from the TMN in rats contain
GAL10. However, the remaining 15% leaves room for additional
neurons projecting to the TMN that do not express GAL. Con-
sistent with this idea, most VLPO neurons projecting to the TMN
fired in the range of 2–6 Hz during sleep and 1 Hz during wake16.
However, other TMN-projecting POA neurons fired at rates of up
to 12 Hz, especially during REM sleep. These faster firing neurons
may produce neurotransmitters other than GAL and may be
activated when photostimulated at 10 Hz, but they would not
have been included in our study, which was limited to VLPOGAL
neurons.
As VLPOGAL neurons contain GABA and other neuropeptides
besides GAL10, it is possible that sleep and Tb changes induced by
activation of VLPOGAL neurons may be mediated by neuro-
transmitters or neuropeptides other than GAL. General photo-
activation of POA GABAergic neurons produced only a minor
increase in sleep45 or even wakefulness16, although there are other
GABAergic neurons in the VLPO region that do not contain
GAL16,46. On the other hand, photoactivation of only GABAergic
POA neurons that project to the TMN (85% of which contain
GAL) produced sleep16. These experiments suggest that there are
several populations of GABAergic neurons in and around the
POA (e.g., the basal forebrain GABAergic arousal neurons are
just lateral to the VLPO core), some of which may promote sleep
while others promote wake25,32. Further investigation is needed
to identify the specific neurotransmitter in GAL neurons involved
in these functions.
An important question is whether the VLPOGAL neurons help
to initiate or to maintain NREM sleep. Neurotoxic lesions of the
VLPO severely shortened NREM sleep bouts12,13, but animals
transitioned into NREM sleep at a normal frequency13. This was
interpreted as the VLPO being critical for NREM sleep main-
tenance rather than initiation. However, in those chronic
experiments, animals likely had an abnormally high sleep drive
due to accumulated sleep loss, and this high sleep pressure may
have increased transitions into NREM sleep. We found that
VLPOGAL photoactivation and chemoactivation increased tran-
sitions into NREM sleep but did not lengthen NREM sleep bouts.
Similarly, chemoactivation reduced NREM sleep latency in an
insomnia model where the drive for wake in mice is extremely
high. These findings suggest a critical role for VLPOGAL neurons
in the initiation of NREM sleep.
Photostimulation of VLPOGAL neurons did not alter REM
sleep whereas chemoactivation strongly suppressed this state.
While photostimulation drives neuronal activity rhythmically,
chemoactivation likely makes neurons more responsive to natural
inputs, and this could drive different downstream responses that
impact REM sleep. Alternatively, hypothermia and thermal stress
during chemogenetic activation of VLPOGAL neurons at room
temperature may also have suppressed REM sleep because (a)
REM sleep loss with chemoactivation of VLPOGAL neurons
positively correlated with the degree of hypothermia, and (b)
REM sleep was recovered with exposure to a thermoneutral Ta
(29 °C). This is unsurprising as changes in Ta and Tb disrupt REM
sleep much more than NREM sleep37,39,43,47–50 and REM sleep is
maximal at a thermoneutral Ta (27–32 °C in mice) and decreases
with Ta above or below these levels51–53.
The severity of hypothermia with chemoactivation of VLPO-
GAL neurons demonstrates an important role for these neurons in
thermoregulation in addition to sleep-wake regulation. In our
previous work in rats10, we found that VLPO neurons project to
the raphe pallidus nucleus, an area that mediates hyperthermic
responses, and that most of the neurons contributing to this
projection are in the region of the dorsal extended VLPO20.
McAllen and colleagues found that neurons in this region, which
they called the caudolateral POA to distinguish it from the
median preoptic nucleus (their “rostromedial” POA), promote
heat loss via tail artery vasodilation54,55. Currently, it is unknown
whether the neurons contributing to this pathway are specifically
galaninergic, but our results suggest that at least some of them
are.

Fig. 7 Chemogenetic activation of VLPOGAL neurons attenuates sleep-
onset insomnia. a Schematic of experimental setup showing mice
introduced to a new cage with fresh nesting material immediately after i.p.
injections of either saline or CNO. b Percentages of NREM sleep every 2 h
for 12 h after saline or CNO (0.3 mg/kg) injections and cage change at
10:00 h. Typically, mice introduced to a new cage during the day (when
they usually sleep about 60% of the time) have reduced sleep for 2–4 h
with a prolonged latency to first NREM sleep. This is rescued by activation
of VLPOGAL neurons. Two-way repeated measures (RM) ANOVA for the

 NREM sleep is usually associated with a small decrease in Tb
(~1 °C) and wakefulness is associated with an increase. In con-
trast, higher Tb can promote NREM sleep (e.g. low grade fever)
and hypothermia causes arousal56–59. However, in our chemo-
genetic experiments, we observed a substantial increase in NREM
sleep
despite
dramatic
hypothermia,
indicating
that
both
responses were consequences of VLPOGAL activation and that
increased NREM sleep was not secondary to the hypothermia.
The additional increase in NREM amounts and decrease in sleep
latency observed when activating VLPOGAL neurons in a warm
environment suggests that hypothermia (and the associated
thermal discomfort) caused some arousal effects at room
temperature.
Thermal and sleep changes induced by VLPOGAL activation
highlight the strong link between these two functions as most
sleep-active POA cells in rats are also warm-sensitive and their
activation may drive thermoregulatory responses24,25,51,57. Local
preoptic warming (which activates warm-sensitive neurons) can
promote NREM sleep and reduce Tb, whereas local cooling does
the opposite8,51,56. Moreover, chemoactivation of POA neurons
that expressed cFos during recovery sleep, resulted in similarly
profound hypothermia60 suggesting that sleep and thermo-
regulatory mechanisms are strongly coupled in the same neurons
in the POA. Our present results indicate that VLPOGAL neurons
play a key role in this coupling.
The anatomical projections of VLPOGAL neurons suggest
pathways through which they can promote NREM sleep and heat
loss. Conditional tracing showed that VLPOGAL neurons in mice
project to targets similar to VLPO neurons in rats10. Both densely
innervate wake-promoting regions, including the LH, TMN, and
LC and moderately innervate the lateral PB and the PPT. Thus,
NREM sleep-promotion by VLPOGAL neurons may be mediated
by simultaneous inhibition of multiple-wake promoting regions.
On the other hand, VLPOGAL stimulation may cause hypother-
mia through projections to the DHA, DMH, lateral PAG, RPa
and PPR, which are considered critical nodes for heat production
and retention. Inhibition of these structures by VLPOGAL neu-
rons may reduce Tb by suppressing thermogenesis and promoting
vasodilation.
Collectively, our optogenetic studies demonstrate that activa-
tion of VLPOGAL neurons within their typical physiological firing
range causes sleep. Additionally, chemoactivation of VLPOGAL
neurons also produced a drastic fall in Tb. However, the relative
degree to which VLPOGAL neurons contribute to sleep vs. ther-
moregulation may depend on their firing patterns, projections
and environmental conditions.
Finally, the deep hypothermia seen with chemoactivation of
VLPOGAL neurons, which is far beyond that seen with normal
wake-sleep cycles, suggests a role in torpor. Torpor is a deeply
hypothermic and unresponsive state, with a slow wave EEG, seen
in mammals (from mice to bears) when food is too scarce for
homeothermy61,62. Torpor permits low metabolism, which can
sustain life when food is unavailable. The relationship between
torpor and sleep has been debated63–65, but our observations
suggest that prolonged activation of VLPO neurons, as with
chemoactivation, may push VLPOGAL neurons into a firing state
that fosters torpor. Thus, rather than just serving as a wake-sleep
switch, the VLPOGAL neurons may serve as a switch with three
positions: wake, sleep, and torpor.
Methods
Mice. We used male GAL-IRES-cre transgenic mice on a C57BL/6J background
(generated by Dr. Münzberg)28,66 and their wild-type (WT) littermates (aged
8–12 weeks at the start of the experiments). Eutopic expression of Cre was verified
by immunostaining for the GAL peptide28 and by crossing GAL-Cre mice with a
reporter line expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and comparing the
expression pattern to that of Gal mRNA in the Allen Brain Atlas28,66. Mice were
maintained under standard vivarium conditions (12 h: 12 h light-dark cycle with
lights on at 07:00 h; 22 ± 1 °C ambient temperature). Care of the animals met
National Institutes of Health standards, as set forth in the Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals, and all protocols were approved by the BIDMC
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Viral vectors. We obtained Cre-dependent adeno-associated viral vectors for
optogenetic stimulation (AAV8-EF1α-DIO-ChR2(H134R)-mCherry), optogenetic
inhibition (AAV8-CAG-Flex-ArchT-GFP), chemogenetic stimulation (AAV8-
hSyn-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry) as well as control viral vectors (AAV8-EF1α-DIO-
mCherry) from the Vector Core at the University of North Carolina, USA. All viral
vectors had titer concentrations of 3–6 × 1012 vector genomes per milliliter. The
specificity of these viral vectors has been confirmed in various Cre lines including
GAL-IRES-Cre mice used in this study35,66. In our hands, we observed that 88.6%
of ChR2-expressing neurons were positive for Gal mRNA (by in situ hybridization
using RNAScope), as well as 88.5% of ArchT-expressing neurons and 90.0% of
hM3Dq-expressing neurons.
Anterograde tracing. For tracing anterograde projections of VLPOGAL neurons,
we anesthetized GAL-IRES-Cre mice (n = 8) with ketamine/xylazine (100 and 10
mg/kg, respectively, i.p.) and injected67 them with 18 nl of AAV8-EF1α-DIO-ChR2
(H134R)-mCherry unilaterally in the VLPO (anteroposterior: +0.15 mm from
bregma, ventral: 5 mm below the dura, lateral +0.5 mm). Six weeks after the
injections, we transcardially perfused the mice under deep anesthesia, with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 10% formalin (Fisher Scientific). We
post-fixed brains in formalin overnight and stored them in 20% sucrose (for
cryoprotection). We then cut the brains into 3 series of 40 µm sections on a
freezing microtome and immunostained one series for mCherry to map the
anterograde projections of mCherry-expressing VLPOGAL neurons.
Surgery. GAL-IRES-Cre mice were anesthetized (100 mg/kg ketamine +10 mg/kg
xylazine; i.p.) and placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments). Mice for
optogenetic experiments received microinjections of 36 nl of AAV [AAV8-EF1α-
DIO-ChR2(H134R)-mCherry (n = 10 mice), AAV8-CAG-Flex-ArchT-GFP (n = 7
mice) or AAV8-EF1α-DIO-mCherry (n = 6 mice)] into the VLPO (ante-
roposterior: +0.15 mm from bregma, ventral: 5 mm below the dura, lateral ±0.5
mm from the midline) bilaterally. Mice for chemogenetic experiments received the
same volume of AAV8-hsyn-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry (n = 13 mice) or AAV8-hsyn-
DIO-mCherry (n = 8 mice) into the VLPO. After the injections, mice for opto-
genetic experiments were implanted with bilateral optical fibers 0.2 mm above the
VLPO27 and electrodes for recording electroencephalogram (EEG), electro-
myogram (EMG)30. A miniature telemetry transmitter for recording Tb and
locomotor activity (LMA) (TA10-TAF20; Data Sciences International., USA)31 was
also implanted into mice for the optogenetic stimulation experiments. Finally, mice
for chemogenetic experiments were implanted with miniature telemetry trans-
mitters (TLM2-F20EET; Data Science International, USA) for recording EEG,
EMG, Tb, and LMA35.
Optogenetic stimulation and inhibition. Mice were connected to the EEG/EMG
wires and optical patch cords >2 weeks prior to recordings to facilitate proper
habituation and natural sleep patterns. For photoactivation experiments, we used a
function generator (PCGU1000, Velleman Instruments, USA) to stimulate both,
VLPOGAL-ChR2 mice (n = 10) and VLPOGAL-mCherry mice (n = 6) with 0.5, 1, 2,
4, 8, and 16 Hz light pulses (10 ms per pulse, 10 mW light output at the fiber tip;
the order of stimulation frequencies was randomized) for 2 h (21:00–23:00 h) and
recorded EEG/EMG, video, body temperature, and locomotion data for 2 h prior
to, during and 2 h after stimulation time. For photoinhibition experiments, we
applied continuous pulses of orange/yellow light for 5 min every 30 min for 24 h
and recorded EEG/EMG signals and video. In the sham inhibition condition the
laser was not switched on, but the function generator still produced 5 min pulses
every 30 min. EEG and EMG signals were amplified (A.M systems, USA), digitized
and recorded using vital recorder software (Kissei Comtek, Japan)13. Tb and LMA
were recorded telemetrically using Dataquest A.R.T 4.1. software (Data Sciences
International., USA)31,35. The order of stimulation frequencies for the photo-
activation experiments was counterbalanced between animals and >3 days of rest
were allowed between stimulation sessions to avoid habituation to induced sleep
patterns. To prevent light leakage into the cage, we used shielded optical patch
cords to connect the implanted optical fibers (200 µm diameter, ThorLabs) to the
DPSSL laser diodes (473 nm, Laserglow, Canada) and employed heat-shrink tubing
as well as black nail polish to further shield all optical connections and even the
dental cement on the implant itself68.
Chemogenetic stimulations. Four weeks after the surgery, VLPOGAL-hM3Dq
mice and VLPOGAL-mCherry mice were injected with either vehicle (saline) or
CNO (0.3 mg/kg; Sigma, USA) and telemetric recordings of sleep-wake behavior,
Tb and LMA were performed for 24 h after each injection using Dataquest ART
4.1 software (Data Sciences International, USA)35. Each animal received injections
of saline and CNO under different conditions: at 10:00 h (light period; ZT 3), 19:00

 h (dark period; ZT 12), novel cage exposure, 22 °C, 29 °C, and 36 °C temperatures.
For the novel cage experiments, mice were transferred immediately after i.p.
injections to another cage (similar to the home cage to which the mice were
habituated for at least a week) with new bedding and nesting material. These
injections and cage transfer were conducted at 10:00 h. Saline and CNO injections
and experimental conditions were randomized and there was at least 1 week
between two CNO injections or two Ta/novel cage conditions in the same mice. All
recordings were performed in an environmental chamber (Powers scientific, USA)
where Ta was controlled within 0.5 °C precision.
Histology. Upon completion of data collection, mice in the optogenetic stimula-
tion experiments underwent a 1 Hz stimulation protocol for 2 h and were then
deeply anesthetized (chloral hydrate; 700 mg/kg body weight) and transcardially
perfused with PBS followed by 10% formalin. Mice in the chemogenetic experi-
ments received CNO (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) and were perfused after 3 h. Brains were cut
into 3 series of 40 µm sections with one series immunolabeled for cFos (as a marker
of neuronal activity; 1° antibody—rabbit (Rb) anti-cFos; Oncogene Sciences; cat.
no: 4188; 1:30000 dilution) and DsRed (to label hM3Dq-mCherry or ChR2-
mCherry-expressing neurons; 1° antibody-Rb-Anti-DsRed; Clontech, USA; cat.no:
632496; 1:10,000 dilution)30,35. Similarly, the brain sections from mice in the
optogenetic inhibition experiments were labeled for cFos and GFP (to label the
ArchT-expressing neurons; 1° antibody-Rb-Anti-GFP; Thermo Fisher Scientific
cat. no: A11122; 1:10,000 dilution). cFos immunoreactivity was visualized with
0.06% DAB solution with 0.01% hydrogen peroxide, 0.01% nickel ammonium
sulphate and 0.005% cobalt chloride, resulting in black nuclear staining. mCherry/
GFP immunoreactivity was then added in a second DAB staining step without
nickel and cobalt, resulting in brown labeling of mCherry/GFP-expressing neurons.
No mCherry/GFP labeling was observed in areas of the brain that did not receive
AAV injections indicating the specificity of the DsRed and GFP antibodies.
In situ hybridization using RNAScope. We processed one series of sections for
labeling with GAL mRNA by in situ hybridization as well as for mCherry/GFP by
immunochemistry. We mounted our brain sections on Superfrost Plus slides in
RNAs-free conditions and dried them in −20 °C overnight. After warming, we
further dried the slides in an oven for 30 min at 40 °C and then performed the
RNAscope hybridization using a RNAScope Multiplex Flourescent Reagent Kit V2
(Catalog #323100, Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Hayward, CA). We followed the
provided instructions and pretreated the sections with hydrogen peroxide for 20
min at room temperature and then performed an antigen retrieval procedure by
placing the slides in a steamer (at >99 °C) for 5 min. We then dehydrated the
sections in 100% alcohol and air-dried them for 5 min. Next, we treated the sec-
tions with protease reagent (Protease III, RNAscope) for 30 min at 40 °C. After
rinsing in sterile water, we incubated the sections in the RNAscope probe for
Galanin-C1 (RNAscope® Probe- Mm-Gal;Cat No. 400961 Advanced Cell Diag-
nostics) for 2 h at 40 °C for the hybridization step. Following the hybridization
procedure, we performed three amplification steps at 40 °C (AMP1-FL and AMP2-
FL: 30 min each; AMP3-FL: 15 min) and subsequently incubated the sections in
HRP blocker for 15 min. We then further incubated the sections in TSA plus
Fluorescein/Cy5 fluorophore (Catalog # NEL741001, Perkin Elmer) for 30 min to
visualize the GAL mRNA (Channel 1 at 488 nm). Since the mCherry or GFP
fluorescence from the viral transfection was quenched by these procedures, we
performed an additional immunolabeling step to re-establish the mCherry/GFP
signals. We incubated the sections in Rabbit anti-DsRed/anti-GFP antibody
(1:7500) at 4 °C overnight, then washed them in PBS (2 × 2 min) and incubated
them in a secondary antibody (Alexa fluor 555/488 Donkey anti-Rabbit, Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Cat. no: A-31572 and A-21206) for 2 hours at room temperature.
Finally, we washed the slides one more time before drying and then cover-slipped
them with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Catalog # H-
1200).
Data analysis. EEG/EMG recordings were scored manually as 10 s epochs
(optogenetic experiments) or 12 s epochs (chemogenetic experiments) into wake,
NREM or REM sleep using SleepSign software (Kessei Comtec, Japan)12,13,35.
Percentages of wake, NREM and REM sleep, bout numbers and average bout
durations of individual sleep-wake states were calculated for 2 h before, during and
after the photostimulations, or every 4 h or 2 h for 24-h after saline or CNO
injections depending upon the experiment. EEG power spectra, specifically delta
and theta power during individual sleep-wake states in the corresponding periods
were also calculated. Mean Tb was calculated every 5 min in all experiments except
in Fig. 6 where 2 h means are presented. NREM and REM sleep latencies were
calculated as the time taken to the first NREM and REM sleep episode, respectively,
from the time of injection. Experimenters scoring sleep-wake data were blinded to
the conditions.
In vitro optogenetic activation and inhibition of VLPOGAL neurons. Three to
eight weeks after AAV-ChR2-mCherry/AAV-ArchT-GFP virus injections into the
VLPO, GAL-cre mice (n = 3 for ChR2; n = 3 for ArchT) were anesthetized with
isoflurane (>4%) and brain slices containing the VLPO (250 µm thick) were pre-
pared for in vitro electrophysiological recordings69. Whole-cell current clamp
recordings69 were performed from VLPOGAL neurons expressing ChR2 or ArchT
(identified by mCherry or GFP fluorescence, respectively) using a Multiclamp 700B
amplifier (Molecular Devices, Foster City, CA, USA), a Digidata 1322 A interface,
and Clampex 9.0 software (Molecular Devices). After achieving stable recordings
for 15 min from ChR2-expressing neurons, we photostimulated them using full-
field 10 ms flashes of light (~10 mW/mm2, 1 mm beam width; at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and
16 Hz frequencies) from a 5 W LUXEON blue light-emitting diode (470 nm
wavelength; #M470L2-C4; Thorlabs, Newton, NJ, USA) coupled to the epi-
fluorescence pathway of the microscope. For ArchT-expressing neurons, we used
full-field 5 min light flashes (2.4 mW/mm2) from a 880 mW LUXEON yellow light-
emitting diode (565 nm wavelength; #M565L3; Thorlabs, Newton, NJ, USA). We
recorded in current clamp mode using K-gluconate-based pipette solution con-
taining (in mM): 120 K-gluconate, 10 KCl, 3 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 2.5 K-ATP, 0.5 Na-
GTP (pH 7.2 adjusted with KOH; 280 mOsm). Data were analyzed using Clampfit
10 (Molecular Devices) and IGOR Pro 6 (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR, USA)
and presented as Mean ± SEM69.
In vitro chemogenetic activation of VLPOGAL neurons. GAL-Cre mice (n = 5)
were injected with AAV-hM3Dq into the VLPO and 6 weeks after the injections,
VLPO slices were collected and whole-cell current clamp recordings were performed
from a total of five neurons27,35. After 15 min of stable recordings, artificial cere-
brospinal fluid (aCSF) containing CNO (1 µM solution) was perfused through the
chamber and recordings continued for another 5 min before washed out by aCSF27,35.
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism
(version 7.03; GraphPad Software, USA). For optogenetic experiments, we com-
pared sleep-wake and Tb data from 2 h during and 2 h immediately after laser
stimulations at various frequencies in VLPOGAL-ChR2 mice and VLPOGAL-
mCherry mice using two-way repeated measures (RM) ANOVAs followed by
Sidak’s post hoc comparisons; whereas, the EEG Power spectra were analyzed using
Mann–Whitney tests. In vitro data were compared using a one-way ANOVA. For
chemogenetic experiments, we compared sleep-wake and Tb data after saline and
CNO treatment from VLPOGAL-hM3dq mice and VLPOGAL-mCherry mice using
two-way RM ANOVAs followed by Sidak’s post hoc comparisons. Sleep latencies
were analyzed using a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test. Sample sizes for
optogenetic and chemogenetic mouse cohorts were determined after pilot experi-
ments with 2–3 mice revealed the effect size and variance between mice.
