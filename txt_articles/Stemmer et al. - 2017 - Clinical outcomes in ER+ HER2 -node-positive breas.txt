The Recurrence Score® is increasingly used in node-positive ER+ HER2-negative breast cancer. This retrospective analysis of a
prospectively designed registry evaluated treatments/outcomes in node-positive breast cancer patients who were Recurrence
Score-tested through Clalit Health Services from 1/2006 through 12/2011 (N = 709). Medical records were reviewed to verify
treatments/recurrences/survival. Median follow-up, 5.9 years; median age, 62 years; 53.9% grade 2; 69.8% tumors ≤ 2 cm; 84.5%
invasive ductal carcinoma; 42.0% N1mi, and 37.2%/15.5%/5.2% with 1/2/3 positive nodes; 53.4% Recurrence Score < 18, 36.4%
Recurrence Score 18–30, and 10.2% Recurrence Score ≥ 31. Overall, 26.9% received adjuvant chemotherapy: 7.1%, 39.5%, and
86.1% in the Recurrence Score < 18, 18–30, and ≥ 31 group, respectively. The 5-year Kaplan–Meier estimates for distant recurrence
were 3.2%, 6.3%, and 16.9% for these respective groups and the corresponding 5-year breast cancer death estimates were 0.5%,
3.4%, and 5.7%. In Recurrence Score < 18 patients, 5-year distant-recurrence rates for N1mi/1 positive node/2–3 positive nodes were
1.2%/4.4%/5.4%. As patients were not randomized to treatment and treatment decision is heavily influenced by Recurrence Score,
analysis of 5-year distant recurrence by chemotherapy use was exploratory and should be interpreted cautiously: In Recurrence
Score < 18, recurrence rate was 7.7% in chemotherapy-treated (n = 27) and 2.9% in chemotherapy-untreated patients (n = 352); P =
0.245. In Recurrence Score 18–30, recurrence rate in chemotherapy-treated patients (n = 102) was significantly lower than in
untreated patients (n = 156) (1.0% vs. 9.7% P = 0.019); in Recurrence Score ≤ 25 (the RxPONDER study cutoff), recurrence rate was
2.3% in chemotherapy-treated (n = 89) and 4.4% in chemotherapy-untreated patients (n = 488); P = 0.521. In conclusion, our
findings support using endocrine therapy alone in ER+ HER2-negative breast cancer patients with micrometastases/1–3 positive
nodes and Recurrence Score < 18.

INTRODUCTION
The 21-gene Recurrence Score®(RS) assay (Oncotype DX® Breast
Recurrence Score assay, Genomic Health Inc), is incorporated in
major international guidelines,1–4 and is widely used to guide
treatment decisions in estrogen receptor (ER)+ human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative node-negative breast
cancer. The prognostic/predictive abilities of the RS assay in this
population were first validated using a prospective–retrospective
study design.5–7 More recently, the RS was further validated as a
prognostic indicator in the TAILORx and West German Study
Group (WSG) PlanB phase 3 trials in which patients were treated
based on their RS results, and in the prospectively designed
analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)
registry, which was complemented with the RS results.8–10
Furthermore, we previously reported findings from an analysis
of a prospectively designed registry including 2028 N0/N1mi ER+
breast cancer patients who were tested through Clalit Health
Services (CHS, the largest health maintenance organization in
Israel),11 which complemented the TAILORx, WSG PlanB, and SEER
studies by providing both rate of recurrence and breast cancer-
specific mortality in a cohort of patients where decision making
incorporated the RS in real-life clinical practice.
Withholding chemotherapy in ER+ HER2-negative node-positive
breast cancer patients remains controversial even in the presence
of data from such studies as the ATAC, ABCSG 6, and ABCSG 8
trials, which have demonstrated that many patients with 1–3
positive nodes do well on endocrine therapy alone.12–14 To further
help identify patients who can safely forgo chemotherapy, RS
testing is increasingly used in patients with up to three positive
axillary lymph nodes. Similar to the approach used for the node-
negative population, the initial validation of the prognostic/
predictive abilities of the RS assay in the node-positive population

 employed a prospective–retrospective study design.7, 15 However,
unlike the node-negative population, at present, the additional
evidence supporting RS testing in the node-positive population
is limited to the aforementioned WSG PlanB study in which all
patients with RS > 11 received chemotherapy, and to a secondary
analysis of the SEER registry in which only breast cancer-specific
mortality has been reported.9, 10 Prospective evidence from the
phase 3 RxPONDER (SWOG S1007) trial evaluating endocrine
therapy alone vs. chemoendocrine therapy in patients with 1–3
positive nodes and RS ≤ 25 is anticipated in the future.16
In Israel, CHS approved reimbursement of the RS assay for node-
negative patients in 1/2006 and extended its coverage to include
node-positive patients in 1/2008. Since its initial reimbursement
approval by CHS and through November 2016, 5483 node-
negative, and 1850 patients with N1mi/1–3 positive nodes have
been tested through CHS. The focus of the current CHS registry
analysis is on the latter population. This analysis was designed to
evaluate, in real-life clinical practice, the relationship between the
RS results, adjuvant treatments received, and clinical outcomes in
patients with N1mi or 1–3 positive nodes who were RS-tested
more than 5 years ago and had their RS results incorporated into
clinical decision making. Notably, this study complements another
study focusing on node-negative patients who were RS-tested
through CHS.17
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Between 1/2006 and 12/2011, 755 CHS members with breast
cancer and N1mi or 1–3 positive lymph nodes were RS-tested
through CHS. Forty patients were excluded for various reasons
(received neoadjuvant treatment, were metastatic at diagnosis,
etc). For four additional patients (0.5%) recurrence data were not
available or they were lost to follow-up, and two more patients
were excluded because they recurred within 6 months of testing
(Supplementary Fig. S1). The final cohort included 709 patients
and the median follow-up was 5.9 (range, 0.3–10.3) years.
Most
patients
were
female
(98%).
Median
age
was
62
(interquartile-range, 53–67) years, 84.6% were ≥50 years; 53.9%
had grade 2 tumors; 69.8% had tumors ≤ 2 cm in size, and 84.5%
had invasive ductal carcinoma. Less than half of all patients
(42.0%) were N1mi, whereas 37.2%, 15.5%, and 5.2% of patients
were diagnosed with 1, 2, and 3 positive axillary lymph nodes,
respectively (Table 1). Overall, patient characteristics seemed
similar in patients across the nodal status groups, and each group
had median follow-up >5 years (Supplementary Table S1).
RS distribution and adjuvant chemotherapy use
Overall, 379 patients (53.4%) had RS < 18, 258 (36.4%) had RS
18–30, and 72 (10.2%) had RS ≥ 31. A wide RS distribution was
observed within each level of clinicopathological characteristic
such as nodal status (N1mi, 1, 2, and 3 positive nodes), age (<40,
40-<50, 50-<60, 60-<70, 70-<80, and ≥80 years), tumor size (≤1,
<1–2, and≥ 2 cm), and tumor grade (1–3) (Supplementary Fig. S2).
The use of adjuvant chemotherapy was consistent with the RS
result. Overall,chemotherapy use was 26.9%, with 7.1% (27/379),
39.5% (102/258), and 86.1% (62/72) receiving adjuvant che-
motherapy in patients with RS < 18, 18–30, and≥31, respectively.
Within the group of patients with RS 18–30, adjuvant chemother-
apy use tended to increase with increasing RS results (Supple-
mentary Fig. S3).
Distant recurrence rates
Overall, with a median follow-up of 5.9 years, 47 patients had
distant recurrences; 14/379, 20/258, and 13/72 in patients with RS
results <18, 18–30, and ≥31, respectively. Kaplan–Meier (KM)
estimates for 5-year distant recurrence rates differed significantly
between the RS groups (P < 0.001; log-rank test). Rates in the RS <
18, 18–30, and ≥31 groups were 3.2% (95% confidence intervals
[CI], 1.8–5.6%),6.3% (95% CI, 3.9–10.1%), and 16.9% (95% CI,
10.0–27.9%), respectively (Fig. 1a). Rates in the RS ≤ 25 and RS > 25
groups (RxPONDER categorization) also differed significantly (RS ≤
25, 4.0% [95% CI, 2.7–6.0%]; RS > 25, 13.1% [95% CI, 8.4–20.3%]; P
< 0.001; log-rank test) (Supplementary Fig. S4). Figure 1b–e
presents subgroup analyses evaluating rates of distant recurrence
by nodal status, age, tumor size, and tumor grade. Examining
patients with RS < 18 by nodal status demonstrated a 5-year
distant recurrence rate of 1.2% (95% CI, 0.3–4.8%), 4.4% (95% CI,
2.0–9.6%), and 5.4% (95% CI, 2.0–13.6%) for N1mi, patients with 1
positive node, and 2–3 positive nodes, respectively (Fig. 1b).

 Breast cancer death rates
Overall, 18 breast cancer deaths were documented including 3/
379, 8/258, and 7/72 in patients with RS < 18, RS 18–30, and RS ≥
31, respectively. KM estimates for 5-year breast cancer death rates
varied significantly between the RS groups (P < 0.001; log-rank
test; Fig. 2), ranging from 0.5% (95% CI, 0.1–2.1%) in RS < 18
patients, 3.4% (95% CI, 1.7–6.7%) in RS 18–30 patients, and 5.7%
(95% CI, 2.2–14.4%) in RS ≥ 31 patients. A significant difference in
breast cancer death rates was also observed between RS ≤ 25 and
RS > 25 patients (RxPONDER categorization): RS ≤ 25, 1.1% (95%
CI, 0.5–2.5%); RS > 25, 6.5% (95% CI, 3.3–12.6%); P < 0.001; log-rank
test (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Risk of distant recurrence/breast cancer death in chemotherapy-
untreated patients
RS testing was developed to predict distant recurrence risk in
patients receiving endocrine therapy alone. In addition to not
receiving chemotherapy, a small subset of patients (2.5%) did not
receive endocrine therapy for various reasons. Therefore, we
performed an analysis in the 90.2% of patients in the RS < 18
group and the 59.3% of patients in the RS 18–30 group that
received
endocrine
therapy
alone.
The
KM
5-year
distant
recurrence rates in these patients were 2.7% (95% CI, 1.4–5.1%)
and 9.9% (95% CI, 6.1–15.9%) in the RS < 18 and RS 18–30 groups,
respectively (P < 0.001; log-rank test; Fig. 3a). The corresponding
breast cancer death rates were 0.6% (95% CI, 0.1–2.3%) and 5.0%
(95% CI, 2.4–10.2%) (P = 0.002; log-rank test; Fig. 3b).
Risk of distant recurrence by chemotherapy treatment
We assessed the KM estimates for 5-year distant recurrence in
patients with RS ≤ 30 by adjuvant chemotherapy use (Fig. 4a). For
this analysis, we used the Paik et al.5 categorization (<18,
18–30,≥31), as well as RS value of 25 as a cutoff (in alignment
with RxPONDER trial16). In RS < 18 patients, recurrence rate was
7.7% in chemotherapy-treated (n = 27) compared to 2.9% in
chemotherapy-untreated patients (n = 352); P = 0.245. In RS 18–30
patients,
however,
recurrence
rate
in chemotherapy-treated
patients (n = 102) was significantly lower than in untreated
patients (n = 156) (1.0% vs. 9.7%, P = 0.019). It appears that this
difference stems from the subgroup of RS 26–30 and not
from
the
18–25
subgroup
(P-values
of
0.017
and
0.058,
respectively) (Fig. 4a). In RS ≤ 25 patients (the RS range where
RxPONDER patients were randomized), recurrence rate was 2.3%
in
chemotherapy-treated
(n = 89)
compared
to
4.4%
in
chemotherapy-untreated patients (n = 488); P = 0.521. Analysis of
KM estimates for 5-year breast cancer death revealed consistent
findings (Fig. 4b). Importantly, as patients were not randomized to
treatment, and the number of recurrences/deaths was small, these
results should be interpreted very cautiously.
Univariate and multivariable analyses
In a univariate analysis performed on the entire cohort, tumor size
(≥2 vs.<2 cm) and the RS group (<18 vs. ≥31; 18–30 vs. ≥31) were
found to have a significant association with distant recurrence risk,
whereas age, grade, and nodal status were nonsignificant
parameters (Supplementary Table S2). Although nodal status
was found to be nonsignificant, we decided to include it in a
multivariable regression analysis (on the same cohort) for clinical
relevance. Thus, the multivariable analysis included tumor size (≥2
vs.<2 cm), nodal status (N1mi vs.1–3 positive nodes), and the RS
group (18–30 vs.<18 and ≥31 vs.<18). Only tumor size and RS
group, but not nodal status were found to be significantly
associated with distant recurrence risk (Table 2). When age and
tumor grade were included in the model, only the RS group and

 tumor size remained statistically significant (P = 0.003 and 0.02,
respectively). When tumor size and RS were included in the model
as continuous parameters, they remained statistically significant
(P < 0.0001 and P = 0.006, respectively).
DISCUSSION
This is the first analysis of a large prospectively designed registry
investigating both distant recurrence and breast cancer death
rates in patients with N1mi (42% in our cohort) or 1–3 positive
nodes (58% in our cohort) where the RS has been incorporated
into real-life clinical decision making. We found that chemother-
apy use was consistent with the RS, and that clinical outcomes
were very good in patients with RS < 18 (5-year distant recurrence
rate, 3.2%; 5-year breast cancer death rate, 0.5%) and also
excellent in the 90.2% of patients with RS < 18 selected to receive
endocrine therapy alone (5-year distant recurrence rate, 2.7%; 5-
year breast cancer death rate, 0.6%).
Chemotherapy use was aligned with the RS results. This finding
is consistent with the CHS N0/N1mi analysis and with decision
impact studies conducted in the N1mi/N1 population world-
wide.18–27 Within the intermediate RS category (RS 18–30),
chemotherapy use increased with higher RS results, consistent
with prior Israeli studies including the analysis of the CHS N0/N1mi
cohort and with the SEER registry analysis for node-negative and
node-positive patients.11, 28, 29 This observation suggests that
clinicians assess the RS result as a continuous parameter.
Our findings are consistent with those found in the original
prospective–retrospective
validation
studies
in
node-positive
patients, with the analysis of node-positive patients in the SEER
registry, and with the results of the prospective WSG PlanB study,
which
included
node
positive
and
high-risk
node-negative
patients, and as such constitutes the only prospective evidence
for the clinical outcomes following RS-based treatment in node-
positive patients (41.2% of the study patients with available tissue
within the tumor bank).7, 9, 10, 15 In WSG PlanB, the RS risk groups
were RS ≤ 11, 12–25, and>25 (similar to those in TAILORx in which
the lower range was RS ≤ 10).8, 9 Patients in the lower RS range
were recommended to omit chemotherapy, whereas all patients
with RS ≥ 12 received chemotherapy. After median follow-up of
35 months, 3-year disease-free survival in patients with RS ≤ 11
(chemotherapy untreated, n = 348) was 98% vs. 98% and 92% in
those with RS 12–25 and RS > 25, respectively.9 Distant recurrence
rates in WSG PlanB patients have not been reported yet.9 Our
findings are also consistent with the previously reported analysis
of the CHS N0/N1mi cohort,11 as in both cases, chemotherapy use
was aligned with the RS results and the risk of recurrence was
significantly higher in patients with higher RS results. Not
surprisingly, in the RS < 18 and RS 18–30 groups, chemotherapy
use was higher in the current cohort than in the corresponding RS
groups in the CHS N0/N1mi cohort, and the 5-year risk of distant
recurrence was also higher in each of the RS groups (RS < 18, 0.8%
vs. 3.2%; RS 18–30, 3.2% vs. 6.3%; RS ≥ 31, 10.3% vs. 16.9%).
Notably, in the original validation study in node-positive patients
(SWOG 8814), all patients received anthracycline-based che-
motherapy;
whereas,
in
WSG
Plan
B,
patients
received
anthracycline-based or taxane-based chemotherapy.9, 15 In our
analysis, as in the previously reported analysis of the N0/N1mi CHS
cohort,11
the
chemotherapy
used
included
predominantly
anthracycline-based or taxane-based regimens.
Thus far, MINDACT has been the only prospective phase 3 trial
reporting findings from randomized arms in which a genomic
assay (the 70-gene signature, MammaPrint® by Agendia, Inc) was

 cancer.30 This trial enrolled 6693 patients with early-stage breast
cancer (79% node-negative and 21% node-positive), of which 644
qualified for the primary analysis. The trial met its primary
endpoint as patients who had high risk by clinical characteristics
(using Adjuvant!Online) and low risk by the 70-gene signature
and were randomized to the non-chemotherapy arm had a
5-year rate of distant recurrence-free survival of 94.7% (the
lower boundary of the 95% CI was 92.5%, which is above the
predefined boundary of 92%).30 Notably, in patients (per-protocol
population) with high clinical risk and low risk by the 70-gene
signature, disease-free survival was significantly better with
chemotherapy (93.3% vs. 90.3%, P = 0.03). In patients (per-protocol
population) with low clinical risk and high risk by the 70-gene
signature, no significant chemotherapy benefit was observed.30
In contrast to the MINDACT findings, our results (consistent with
the
prospective-retrospective
RS
validation
studies
showing
minimal chemotherapy benefit in low RS patients15) strongly
support forgoing chemotherapy in patients with ER+ HER2-
negative breast cancer with micrometastases/1–3 positive nodes
and RS < 18 and treating them with endocrine therapy alone.
Unlike our previously reported findings for N0 patients,11 the
current analysis of node-positive patients does not support
sparing adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with RS 18–25 and
suggests that chemotherapy treatment should be recommen-
dedto all patients with RS > 18.
Notably, in this analysis of a real-life, national level large registry,
no exclusion criteria were applied with respect to age, gender,
location, socioeconomic status or comorbidities. Nevertheless, the
registry analysis is limited by its nonrandomized design and the
potential for selection bias with respect to patients being selected
for RS testing; in Israel the test is less frequently used in the node-
positive population relative to the node-negative population and
we estimate that 40% of eligible N1mi/N1 patients are being
tested. Another limitation is the generalizability of our findings, as
the
population
in
our
analysis
was
mostly
Caucasian.
As
chemotherapy treatment decisions at CHS rely heavily on the RS
result, particularly within the RS < 18 and RS ≥ 31 groups, analyses
of outcomes
by chemotherapy
use should be interpreted
cautiously. The subgroup analyses should also be interpreted
cautiously as some of the groups (e.g., patients with 2 or 3 positive
nodes) are small and the event rate is very low. Notably, if the
event rate is this low in the RxPONDER trial, where the analysis is
event-driven, it may take longer than expected until the data
become available. Chemotherapy benefit is expected to be seen in
the first years after treatment and our cohort has a median follow-
up of 5.9 years. Further analysis is planned when the cohort has
longer median follow-up to assess risk of late recurrences.
In conclusion, in this analysis of prospectively-designed registry
assessing distant recurrence and breast cancer death in ER+ HER2-
negative breast cancer patients with N1mi or 1–3 positive nodes
where the RS result has been incorporated in treatment decision
making, chemotherapy-untreated patients with RS < 18 had very
good clinical outcomes supporting the use of endocrine therapy
alone in this population.
METHODS
Patient population
This retrospective analysis of a prospectively designed registry investigated
the relationship between the RS, adjuvant treatments received, and clinical
outcomes in all CHS patients with ER+ HER2-negative breast cancer and
N1mi or 1–3 positive nodes who were RS-tested between 1/2006 (CHS
approval of the assay) and 12/2011. The primary endpoint was distant
recurrence and the secondary endpoint was breast cancer death. Exclusion
criteria included: ER-negativity by immunohistochemistry (IHC; cutoff: 0.5)
and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed as
part of the 21-gene assay (cutoff: 6.5 units); HER2 positivity by IHC (cutoff:
3), fluorescence in situ hybridization (ratio cutoff: 2.2), or RT-PCR performed
as part of the 21-gene assay (cutoff: 10.7 units); receiving trastuzumab in
the adjuvant setting; receiving neoadjuvant treatment; having metastatic
disease at the time of testing or within 6 months of testing (as the latter
were assumed to be metastatic at diagnosis); and receiving adjuvant
therapy for another malignancy within 6 months of testing.
This registry analysis was approved by the institutional review boards of
the CHS Community Division and participating medical centers, and was
granted a waiver for obtaining patient consent. It was conducted in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Data source
The following data sources were used: The Teva Pharmaceutical Industries
Oncotest database (for RS results and patient/tumor characteristics);
medical records (for treatments received and recurrence/death status); and
the CHS claims arm (for treatments received and death status). Those
extracting the clinical information were unaware of the RS status.
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis plan was pre-specified. Descriptive statistics were
used to summarize clinicopathological characteristics and adjuvant
treatment
decision. The primary endpoint was 5-year KM distant
recurrence estimates and 95% CI by RS risk categories as defined by Paik
et al.5 (<18, 18–30,≥31). Patients without recurrence were censored at the
time of last follow-up, date of medical records review, or at time of death
(due to any cause). A secondary endpoint was 5-year KM breast cancer
death estimates and 95% CI. Patients with metastatic disease at the time of
death were considered events, patients were censored at the time of last
follow-up or death from other causes, and recurrences were ignored for
purposes of this endpoint. Analysis was also performed on clinicopatho-
logical subgroups, as well as within the intermediate RS group (18–25,
26–30), using a cutoff of 25 as in the RxPONDER trial.16 As exploratory
analysis,

and

by
chemotherapy use within RS risk categories as defined by Paik et al.5
and within the intermediate group (18–25, 26–30) were examined. A 2-
degrees of freedom log-rank test was used to compare distant recurrence
rates across RS groups. Survival curves are presented through 7-years,
though all observed events and follow-up are utilized for statistical tests.
Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the
association of RS group (<18, 18–30, ≥31), age (50–69 vs. <50; ≥70 vs. <50
years), size (<2, ≥2 cm), grade (1–3), and nodal status (N1mi vs. 1–3 positive
nodes) with distant recurrence. RS and tumor size were also included as
continuous variables. Univariate analysis identified a set of prognostic
baseline factors, and a full multivariable model was fit. Non-significant
covariates were removed from the multivariate analysis. Proportional
hazards assumptions were assessed and met in the final model. SAS 9.4
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used for the analysis. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
