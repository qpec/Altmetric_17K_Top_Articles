Adolescence is a developmental period in which the mesolimbic dopaminergic “reward”
circuitry of the brain, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc), undergoes significant plasti-
city. Dopamine D1 receptors (D1rs) in the NAc are critical for social behavior, but how these
receptors are regulated during adolescence is not well understood. In this report, we
demonstrate that microglia and complement-mediated phagocytic activity shapes NAc
development by eliminating D1rs in male, but not female rats, during adolescence. Moreover,
immune-mediated elimination of D1rs is required for natural developmental changes in male
social play behavior. These data demonstrate for the first time that microglia and
complement-mediated immune signaling (i) participate in adolescent brain development in a
sex-specific manner, and (ii) are causally implicated in developmental changes in behavior.
These data have broad implications for understanding the adolescent critical period of
development, the molecular mechanisms underlying social behavior, and sex differences in
brain structure and function.

 A
dolescence is a developmental stage characterized by
increased
exploration,
risk
taking,
and
social
interaction1,2. During this period, the mesolimbic dopa-
minergic ‘reward’ circuitry of the brain, which includes the ven-
tral tegmental area (VTA), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and nucleus
accumbens (NAc), undergoes significant developmental plasticity
and neural circuit maturation3. A behavioral hallmark of ado-
lescence is increased peer-centered social interaction2. Interest-
ingly, access to social experience can be used in lieu of addictive
drugs to induce conditioned place preference, operant con-
ditioning, or maze performance4, and social interactions can
modulate addiction-like behaviors, acting to enhance or diminish
drug-seeking behaviors in different contexts5. Furthermore, NAc
dopamine transients are induced by brief social interactions in
both adult and adolescent rats; however, adult dopamine
responses habituate, while adolescent dopamine responses persist
in subsequent peer interactions6. Taken together, these data
suggest that social interaction itself is a highly rewarding/moti-
vating experience that engages the dopaminergic reward circuitry,
perhaps especially during adolescence.
Dopamine receptors in the NAc are required for social play
behavior in adolescent rats7, and two seminal studies have used
optical and genetic tools to define a hypothalamic-VTA-NAc
circuit underlying social behavior. Oxytocin innervation from the
paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) to the VTA
increases VTA neuron excitability, and initiates dopamine release
into the NAc, promoting pro-social behavior8. Remarkably, the
VTA-NAc dopaminergic response was mediated specifically by
NAc dopamine D1 receptors (D1rs), and not dopamine D2
receptors (D2rs), in adult female mice9. Interestingly, several
subtypes of dopamine receptors, including D1rs, are down-
regulated (via unknown mechanisms) during adolescence in the
PFC and dorsal striatum10–14. Within the NAc, there are con-
flicting reports: some conclude dopamine receptors are not
downregulated in the NAc in adolescence10, while other reports
conclude that they are, indeed, downregulated11,13. Thus, the data
collectively suggest that NAc D1rs are critical mediators of social
behavior, but how the dopamine system in the NAc develops
during adolescence, and how this development modulates social
behaviors remains unclear.
Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, are critical
mediators of neural circuit development in certain brain regions,
e.g., in synaptic pruning and refinement15. For instance, in the
developing retinogeniculate nucleus of male mice, the classical
immune complement system, including complement protein C3,
“tags” synapses for elimination16. Microglia, which exclusively
express C3 receptor (C3R, often referred to as CD11b) recognize
this tag, phagocytose, and lysosomally degrade the synapse.
Altogether, this process results in the developmental refinement
of ocular inputs16,17. Moreover, genetic models lacking either
components of the complement signaling family or microglial-
specific signaling exhibit increased synaptic numbers15,16,18.
Remarkably, time-lapse imaging in developing organotypic hip-
pocampal cultures has recently revealed that the role microglia
play in synaptic remodeling is far more diverse than previously
appreciated, and includes pre-synaptic “trogocytosis”, or “nib-
bing”, and induction of post-synaptic filopodia and post-synaptic
reorganization19. While the complement system has been impli-
cated through genetic manipulations in the development of the
retinogeniculate nucleus16,20 and in pathological states21–24, it
was not necessary for pre-synaptic trogocytosis in organotypic
cultures
of
developing
hippocampus19.
Microglia/immune-
mediated synaptic pruning is well characterized in early postnatal
development, though its role in adolescent development has yet to
be explored. Interestingly, a recent report showed increased
association of synaptic elements (post-synaptic spines and
pre-synaptic glutamatergic terminals) with microglia in the pre-
frontal cortex during adolescence, indicating that immune-
mediated synaptic pruning could also be occurring in regions
with protracted development25. Taken together these data
collectively suggest that microglia and immune signaling may
constitute a ubiquitous developmental mechanism by which
neural circuits, and theoretically behaviors mediated by these
circuits, mature. We thus sought to determine if microglia and
the complement system participate in dopaminergic development
via D1r elimination in the NAc during adolescence. Furthermore,
we aimed to determine whether microglia-mediated circuit
refinement can account for normal developmental changes in
behavior, which has not yet been established.
Herein, we report sex-specific microglia and complement-
mediated phagocytosis and elimination of D1rs in the adolescent
NAc. While D1rs are downregulated in both the male and female
NAc, albeit at different ages, D1r downregulation is mediated via
microglia and complement C3-mediated phagocytic elimination
only in males. Moreover, we report for the first time that
microglia-mediated receptor changes are required for natural
developmental changes in behavior, specifically, adolescent social
play behavior in males. Interestingly, though immune processes
are
not
regulating
D1r
levels
in
females,
perturbing the
complement–microglial relationship locally in the NAc also alters
social play behavior in females, suggesting that an as yet unde-
termined immune process is occurring in the female NAc during
adolescence to mediate basal levels of social behavior. These data
have broad implications for understanding the adolescent critical
period of development, the molecular mechanisms underlying
social behavior, and sex differences in brain structure and
function.
Results
D1r downregulation correlates with microglial degradation.
Our first goal was to determine the pattern of D1r and C3
expression over the course of male and female adolescent devel-
opment in rats. We assessed tissue at four ages: postnatal day 20
(P20) representing pre-adolescent animals, P30 representing early
adolescence, P38 representing mid-adolescence, and P54 repre-
senting late adolescence. We focused our investigation on the
dorso-medial area of the anterior NAc, as this area had robust
D1r immunoreactivity (Supplementary Fig. 1). Importantly,
throughout this report, male and female tissue was imaged with
different acquisition parameters, and thus a direct comparison of
males and females cannot be made. Immunofluorescent analysis
revealed significant D1r downregulation in male rats between P30
and 38 (Fig. 1a; Table 1A) and in female rats between P20 and 30
(Fig. 1e; Table 1D), which was confirmed in a separate group of
animals using chromogenic immunohistochemistry (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1D,E). Next we determined if expression patterns of
complement C3 correlated with D1r expression patterns. In
males, C3 levels are highest at P30 (Fig. 1b; Table 1B), concurrent
with peak D1r levels. However, in females, C3 levels did not peak
concurrently with D1rs, and were highest at P38 (Fig. 1f;
Table 1E). Interestingly, in both males and females, decreased
Iba1 expression (a ubiquitous protein on microglia) was observed
concurrently with D1r elimination (Fig. 1c, g; Table 1C, F).
If C3 is being utilized as a tag to recruit microglia and
subsequent phagocytic activity as has been documented in the
developing retinogeniculate system16,17, then we postulated that
microglia, which exclusively express C3R/CD11b, should contact
C3-tagged protein complexes and mediate their elimination via
lysosomal degradation. To assess this, we measured the volume of
D1r and C3 signal either in contact with or inside microglia using
volumetric reconstruction of Iba1 immunoreactivity to outline

 microglial morphology (Fig. 1i). We used the colocalization of C3
and D1r, or the areas in which the fluorescent signals of C3 and
D1r substantially overlap, as an additional tool to probe the
interactions of microglia with D1rs specifically in close proximity
to C3 “tags”. In males, both D1rs (Fig. 1j; Table 1G) and
colocalized C3-D1rs (Fig. 1l; Table 1I) are maximally contacted
by microglia at P30 and/or P38, the ages between which D1rs are
downregulated. Male microglial contact of C3 does not change
over time (Fig. 1j; Table 1H), which was unsurprising as
presumably C3 is tagging many things other than D1rs during
this time. However, in females, microglia maximally contact D1rs
(Fig. 1m; Table 1J) and C3 (Fig. 1n; Table 1K) at P54, rather than
prior to or during D1r downregulation between P20 and 30.
Interestingly, there is no significant difference in colocalized C3-
D1r contact by microglia across developmental time points
(Fig. 1o; Table 1L)
Expression levels of CD68, a lysosomal protein in microglia,
have been used as a marker to examine phagocytic activity, such
as synaptic pruning16,17. Therefore, we measured the expression
levels and content of CD68+ microglial lysosomes over the
course of adolescent development in both sexes (Fig. 2a). In
males, CD68 expression peaks from P30 to 38 (Fig. 2b; Table 2A),
while in females, CD68 levels were highest at P30 (Fig. 2f;
Table 2E). Interestingly, while not significant, female CD68 levels
seemed to increase again at P54, raising the possibility of distinct
phases of microglial phagocytic processes in the female NAc over
the course of adolescence. When we examined the content of
CD68+ microglial lysosomes using volumetric reconstructions

Fig. 1 D1r downregulation in adolescence is associated with complement C3 and microglial engulfment in males, but not the females. Triple-label
immunohistochemistry for D1r, C3, and Iba1 was performed and protein expression levels for each target were normalized for z-stack size. Because male
and female tissue was processed at different times and required different image acquisition parameters, neither data nor images can be directly compared
between the sexes. Representative images precede histograms; scale bars are equal to 20 µm. Males: a D1r levels transiently increased at P30 (Table 1A);
b C3 levels decreased after P30 (Table 1B); c Iba1 levels decreased after P30 (Table 1C). d Merged male images. Females: e D1r levels decreased after P20
(Table 1D);f C3 levels transiently increased at P38 (Table 1E); g Iba1 levels decreased after P20 (Table 1F). h Merged female images. Images were then
analyzed using a volumetric reconstruction of Iba1 (i.e., microglia) as a mask to determine the volume of D1r, C3, or colocalized C3-D1r physically
associated with (either in contact with or inside) microglia. Masked volumes were normalized for total protein of the target and total Iba1 (see Methods).

and C3 are located, but not colocalized, demonstrating the sensitivity of colocalization analyses. Closed arrow head indicates a region of the microglia
where D1r and C3 colocalize (C3-D1r). Males: j D1rs are maximally contacted by microglia (irrespective of changing D1r and Iba1 levels) at P30 (Table 1G).
k C3 contact by microglia does not change over time (Table 1H), and L C3-D1r contact is high between P30-P38 (Table 1I). Females: m D1rs are maximally
contacted by microglia at P54, not at P20, prior to their elimination (Table 1J). n C3 contact is also increased at P54 (Table 1K), while o C3-D1r contact
does not change over development (Table 1L)

D1r (Fig. 2c; Table 2B) and colocalized C3-D1r (Fig. 2e; Table 2D)
content within lysosomes was highest at P30 and P38 in males.
Consistent with no changes in C3 contact by microglia over male
adolescent development, there was no change in C3 levels
associated with CD68+ lysosomes (Fig. 2d; Table 2C). In females,
D1r content in CD68+ lysosomes was highest at P30 and P54,
mirroring overall CD68 levels in females (Fig. 2g; Table 2F).
Intriguingly, C3 lysosomal content was also bimodal during
female adolescence, but with high levels at P20 and P54 (Fig. 2h;

Fig. 2 D1r downregulation in adolescence is associated with complement C3 and microglial lysosomal degradation in the male, but not the female, NAc. To
assess microglial phagocytic activity and whether D1r, C3, or C3-D1r were localized in microglial CD68+ lysosomes, immunohistochemistry for CD68, D1r,
and C3 was performed. a Representative 2D triple-label immunohistochemistry (scale bar 20 µm), with enlarged 3D representation (scale bar 2 µm) of the
selected area demonstrating (left-right) D1r, C3, and C3-D1r within CD68+ lysosomes. Closed arrow head indicates a lysosome where D1r and C3
colocalize (C3-D1r). Males: c CD68 levels are high from P30 to 38 (Table 2A). b D1r content in CD68+ lysosomes is highest at P30 (Table 2B), d C3
content in lysosomes does not change over development (Table 2C), and e C3-D1r content in lysosomes is transiently elevated at P30 (Table 2D).
Females: f CD68 levels are transiently elevated at P30 (Table 2E). g D1r content in CD68+ lysosomes is high at both P30 and P54 (Table 2F), h C3 content
in lysosomes is highest at P20 and P54 (Table 2G), and i C3-D1r content in lysosomes does not change over development (Table 2H). For all experiments,
n = 4 animals/sex/group. Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVAs and Holm-Sidak’s post-hoc comparisons. Histograms portray the mean ± SEM with

 Table 2G). Despite significant D1r and C3 expression in CD68+
lysosomes, there was no change in colocalized C3-D1r content
(Fig. 2i; Table 2H). Together, these data support the notion that
C3-tagging and microglial immune processes may be regulating
D1r levels in males during adolescence, while in females there
may be meaningful interactions between D1r, C3, and microglia,
but the data are not yet clear if those processes are related to one
another.
C3–C3R interactions mediate sex-specific D1r elimination.
Neutrophil inhibitor factor (NIF) is a well-characterized canine
hookworm peptide that binds specifically to the CD11b subunit of
C3R, occluding its ability to bind its natural ligands26,27. NIF has
been used systemically to improve stroke outcomes in a rat
model28, treat diabetic retinopathy in mice29, and as an
exploratory treatment for stroke in humans30. In vitro, NIF binds
with high affinity to CD11b and is irreversible in some
experimental conditions27. Indeed, in humans, a single infusion
of 1.0–1.5 mg/kg recombinant NIF (UK-279,276) can saturate
over 80% of CD11b receptors in serum for at least 7 days30.
However, to our knowledge, whether NIF can affect microglia has
not been assessed. We first tested whether NIF can inhibit pha-
gocytosis in microglia ex vivo. Microglia were isolated from whole
brain and treated with media containing either vehicle, 60 ng NIF
(reconstituted according to manufacturer’s recommendations at
200 µg/mL; 1×), or 120 ng NIF (reconstituted at 400 µg/mL; 2×).
Fluorescent carboxylate microspheres (hereafter referred to as
beads) were applied to induce phagocytic activity. After 90 mins,
phagocytic activity was significantly impaired when microglia
were exposed to 60 ng, but not 120 ng of NIF (Fig. 3A; Table 3A).
In a separate set of ex vivo experiments without beads (Fig. 3B),
there were no changes in NIF (Fig. 3C; Table 3B) or CD11b
(Fig. 3D; Table 3C) immunoreactivity for up to 120 min in
microglia exposed to 60 ng NIF, indicating that at least under

 these conditions, NIF treatment did not result in NIF-CD11b
complex endocytosis and degradation.
If D1r downregulation in the NAc results from C3 tagging and
microglial phagocytosis, then blocking the ability of microglial
C3R to recognize and bind C3 should disrupt the normal
developmental elimination of D1rs. To examine this hypothesis,
we
utilized
a
within-animal
design:
we
pharmacologically
disrupted C3–C3R interactions in the NAc with NIF in one
hemisphere, while the contralateral control NAc was treated with
vehicle (sterile PBS), thus allowing it to undergo normal
developmental D1r downregulation processes. NIF (60 ng in
300 nL) was microinjected into the dorsomedial NAc of one
hemisphere, and vehicle into the contralateral hemisphere of
either P30 males or P22 females (Supplementary Fig. 2A, B), ages
at which D1r downregulation has not yet occurred in each sex.
Tissue was collected 8 days later, at P38 and P30 in males and
females, respectively (Fig. 3e, g). This age was chosen for
assessment because it is an age at which each sex should have
undergone developmental downregulation of D1rs; thus if there
are changes in NAc D1r levels by virtue of impaired C3–C3R
interactions, they should be apparent when compared with the
contralateral control hemisphere. In males, D1r immunoreactivity
in the NAc of NIF-treated hemispheres were on average ~25%
higher than contralateral vehicle-treated hemispheres (Fig. 3f;
Table 3D), while there was no difference in D1r levels between
NIF and vehicle-treated hemispheres in females (Fig. 3h; Table 3E;
Supplementary Fig. 2F,G). An important caveat should be noted:
NIF
was
cleared
in
vivo
3–5
days
after
microinjection
(Supplementary Fig. 2E), and thus how NIF was cleared and
whether NIF clearance on its own caused changes in D1r
regulation in the NAc is unclear. These data demonstrate for the
first time a sex-specific immune mechanism regulating dopami-
nergic NAc development during adolescence.
Sex-specific social behaviors require C3–C3R interactions. We
next sought to determine if D1r downregulation, and thus the
mechanisms which regulate this process, could have con-
sequences for normal developmental changes in adolescent
behavior. Social behavior, and in particular, social play behavior is
known to peak during adolescence and requires dopamine sig-
naling in the NAc7. Moreover, recent dissection of the neural
circuitry supporting pro-social behavior has implicated D1rs in
the NAc as a key substrate8,9. To first assess if social behaviors
change over the adolescent ages in which we characterized
molecular development in the NAc, separate cohorts of experi-
mental male and female rats were single-housed for 24 h, a period

Fig. 3 C3–C3R interactions mediate developmentally-typical D1r elimination in vivo in males, but not females. Neutrophil inhibitor factor (NIF), a peptide
that binds specifically to the CD11b subunit of C3 receptors (C3Rs), was assessed for its efficacy in reducing microglial phagocytic activity ex vivo. a In
microglia isolated from whole brain, 60 ng, but not 120 ng NIF inhibited microglial phagocytosis of fluorescent beads (Table 3A). Representative images
precede histograms; scale bar equals 20 µm. n = 4, with 2 replications/condition. b Microglia were isolated from whole brain and incubated with 60 ng NIF,
and then immunocytochemically assessed for NIF and CD11b at 30, 60, and 120 min. Closed arrow heads indicate NIF (green) immunoreactivity. Scale bar
equals 10 µm. There was no change in c NIF or (Table 3B) d CD11b (Table 3C) immunoreactivity over 2 h, suggesting that NIF was not causing the
degradation of its receptor. n = 3; 2 replications/condition. To determine if developmental D1r downregulation requires C3–C3R interactions, NIF or Vehicle
was microinjected in the NAc at e P30 in males and g P22 in females (both represent sex-specific ages prior to D1r downregulation), and then tissue was
assessed at P38 and P30, respectively, an age at which D1rs should be developmentally downregulated. f In males, NIF-treated hemispheres exhibited
significantly more (~25%) D1r immunoreactivity than within-animal vehicle-treated hemispheres (Table 3D). h In females, NIF-treated hemispheres
exhibited the same D1r immunoreactivity as within-animal vehicle-treated hemispheres (Table 3E). Representative images precede histograms; scale bars
equal 100 µm. n = 4/sex with counterbalanced injections. For ex vivo experiments, data were analyzed with one-way ANOVAs and Holm-Sidak’s post-hoc
comparisons. For in vivo experiments, D1r data from 4–7 different sections per animal were averaged and then calculated as a percentage of within-animal
vehicle control levels. Data were analyzed with 2-tailed one-sample t-tests. Histograms portray the mean ± SEM with individual data points overlaid.

 of isolation known to increase social interaction and play without
inducing long-lasting detrimental effects31,32. The following day,
a novel age-matched and sex-matched rat was introduced into the
home cage of the experimental rat, and their interactions were
recorded for 10 min (a “resident intruder” paradigm;33,34 Fig. 4a).
Social play and social exploration (i.e., non-play social behavior
consisting of allogrooming and sniffing of the conspecific) initi-
ated by the experimental animal was scored by an experimenter
blind to age and sex conditions. Strikingly, male social play
behavior mirrored the pattern of NAc D1r expression: social play
transiently peaked at P30 (Fig. 4b; Table 4A), with no changes in
social exploration (Fig. 4c; Table 4B). Increased total play beha-
vior was accompanied by increased incidence of classic play
postures in the experimental animal, including nape attacks and
supine postures (Supplementary Fig. 3A-E). In contrast, play
levels did not significantly change over time in females (Fig. 4D;
Table 4C; Supplementary Fig. 3F-J). Rather, female social
exploration increased at P30 and then decreased again at P54
(Fig. 4e; Table 4D). Neither weight differences between the
experimental and control animals nor estrous cycle where
applicable in females (P38 and 54) correlated with behavior
(Supplementary Fig. 3K-M).
These data demonstrate a behavioral correlate, specifically
social play behavior, to NAc D1r expression patterns in males
during adolescent development. While behavior did change over
adolescence in females and warrants further investigation, there
was no overt correlation with the pattern of D1r expression in the
NAc. To determine if there was a causal link between the male-
specific immune-mediated D1r elimination we observed in the
NAc and male-specific changes in social play during adolescence,
we bilaterally microinjected NIF or vehicle into the NAc of males
at P30 and females at P22, and then assessed social behavior at
P38 and P30, respectively (Fig. 4f). Male social play behavior
(Fig. 4g; Table 4E), but not social exploration (Fig. 4h; Table 4F),
was significantly increased in NIF-treated relative to vehicle-
treated males. While there was no significant change in discrete
play postures when analyzed separately, the change in play
behavior was primarily characterized by increases in the number
of nape attacks and supine postures exhibited by NIF-treated
animals (Supplementary Fig. 4A-E). To our surprise, NIF-treated
females also demonstrated modestly (but significantly) increased
social play (Fig. 4i; Table 4G), but not social exploration behavior
(Fig. 4j; Table 4H). NIF-treated females also exhibited more nape
attacks
and
miscellaneous
play
elicitations
(Supplementary
Fig. 4f–j). There was a significant correlation between weight
and

correlations between weight and social behaviors (Supplemental
Fig. 4K–N). NIF microinjections into the NAc at P54 (Supple-
mentary Fig. 2C, D) had no effect on social behaviors in either
males or females (Supplementary Fig. 5), indicating that the
behavioral efficacy of NIF is contingent on C3–C3R interactions
during active periods of development.
C3–C3R regulation of D1rs impacts male social play. In a final
set of experiments, we determined if the behavioral consequences
of NAc NIF treatment on social play behavior were D1r depen-
dent. NIF was co-injected with siRNA against rat D1r (200 µM;
NIF si) in one hemisphere, and control scrambled RNA (scRNA)
in the contralateral hemisphere (NIF sc) at P30 in males and P22
in females (Fig. 5a, c). Despite the presence of NIF, D1r levels
were decreased in the siRNA treated hemispheres of all subjects
when D1r immunoreactivity was assessed 8 days later in both
sexes (P38 in males and P30 in females; Fig. 5b, d; Table 5A, B).
Next, we bilaterally co-injected NIF/vehicle with sc/siRNA against
D1r into the NAc in P30 males or P22 females, and then tested
social behavior as described at P38 and P30, respectively (Fig. 5E).
Replicating the previous findings, using NIF to inhibit C3–C3R
interactions at P30 (Fig. 5e) increased social play behavior at P38
in males, but this effect was blocked by siRNA against rat D1r
(Fig. 5f; Table 5C; Supplementary Fig. 6A-E), with no changes in
social exploration in any group (Fig. 5g; Table 5D). In females,
the unexpected increase in social play at P30 by P22 NIF injec-
tions was not prevented by siRNA against rat D1r, indicating this
effect on play is independent of D1r (Fig. 5h; Table 5E; Supple-
mentary Fig. 6F-J), again with no changes in social exploration
(Fig. 5i; Table 5F). Collectively, this report demonstrates for the
first time a developmentally-restricted or age-restricted and sex-
specific role for immune signaling and microglia in develop-
mental changes in behavior, with C3–C3R regulation of D1rs in
the NAc mediating overt developmental changes in social play
behavior in males, and C3–C3R regulation of an as yet unde-
termined process impacting basal levels of social play behavior in
females.

 Discussion
Herein, we describe a role for microglia and immune signaling in
sex-specific dopaminergic development in the NAc and social
behavior during adolescence. D1rs in the NAc are downregulated
during adolescent development in males, between early-mid
adolescence (P30–38), and in females between the peri-early
adolescent period (P20–30). While both sexes undergo D1r
downregulation, the mechanisms by which this is accomplished
are starkly different: in males, interactions between complement
C3 and the microglia-specific C3R mediate the engulfment and
lysosomal elimination of D1rs. However, D1r downregulation in
females appears to be independent of complement C3 and
microglia. D1r expression patterns in the NAc mirror social play
behavior in males (but not females), raising the possibility that
D1r expression and the immune mechanisms which regulate it
could be causally linked with developmental changes in behavior.
Indeed, pharmacological interference of C3–C3R interactions
decreases microglial phagocytic activity ex vivo, increases D1r

Fig. 4 Sex-specific social behavior patterns over adolescence require C3–C3R interactions. a Experimental design: separate cohorts of experimental animals
(n = 8/sex/age) were single-housed for 24 h prior to test, after which time a novel age-matched and sex-matched conspecific was introduced into their
home cage. Ten minutes of interactions were recorded, and later an experimenter blinded to the conditions coded the interactions for either total play or
social exploration (i.e., non-play social behavior). Only behaviors initiated by the experimental animal were considered. Males: b Male social play behavior
transiently increased at P30 (Table 4A), c with no changes in social exploration over development (Table 4B). Females: d Female social play behavior did
not change over development (Table 4C), e while social exploration peaked from P30 to 38 (Table 4D). f To determine if C3–C3R interactions regulating
D1r levels between P30 and 38 in males is required for the decline in social play behavior observed at this time, NIF or vehicle was injected bilaterally in
P30 males or P22 females (n = 10/sex/treatment). Animals were then single housed for 24 h at P37 or P29, and assessed for social behavior as described
at P38 and P30, respectively. Males: g Interrupting C3–C3R interactions at P30 increased social play behavior at P38 (Table 4E), h without affecting social
exploration (Table 4F). Females: i Female social play behavior, while at a low basal level, also modestly increased at P30 after P22 NIF injection (Table 4G),
j with no changes in social exploration (Table 4H). Data were analyzed either with one-way ANOVAs and Holm-Sidak’s post-hoc comparisons or with two-
tailed unpaired t-tests. Histograms portray the mean ± SEM with individual data points overlaid. Significant post-hoc Holm-Sidak t-tests (b–e) and unpaired
t-tests (g–j) (p < 0.05) comparisons are delineated with an asterisk. All statistics are in Table 4

 levels in vivo, and increases social play in a D1r-dependent
manner in males. Surprisingly, though C3–C3R interactions are
not regulating D1r levels in females and levels of play are overall
lower compared to males, perturbing C3R with NIF also increases
social play behavior in females, but this occurs in a D1r-
independent manner.
The dopaminergic mesolimbic reward circuitry plays a central
role in a broad repertoire of cognitive, social, and motor func-
tions, thus linking abnormalities in this system to a wide variety
of neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegenerative
diseases. Intriguingly, a number of neuropsychiatric disorders
commonly emerge in adolescence, including depression, anxiety,
schizophrenia, and addictive behaviors, many of which present
with a striking sex bias35,36. This convergence suggests that there
may be instances in which adolescent development is misdirected
from a normal, healthy state to a disordered, pathologic state,
potentially
in
sex-specific
ways.
However,
the
molecular
mechanisms underlying reward circuitry development in ado-
lescence are not well known, and, consequently, what causes
“misdirected development” or how it is mediated at the molecular
level remains unclear. In particular, the neural circuitry under-
lying social behavior has garnered increasing attention with the
recognition of social deficits as a common symptom in a variety
of neurodevelopmental (i.e., autism) and neuropsychiatric (i.e.,
anxiety or schizophrenia) disorders. Consistent with our data,
social play behavior has been reported to be most robust between
P30–40 in rats, and generally (though not exclusively) rough-and-
tumble play is higher in male than in female adolescents37,38.
Interestingly, we did not see changes in female social play
behavior over adolescence, but rather in social exploration, which
we defined as allogrooming (social grooming) and conspecific
sniffing. Social interactions in adolescence, and play behavior in
particular, are thought to be a way for males to ‘practice’ beha-
viors that result in hierarchical and sexual competency later in
life39,40. In females, however, adolescent social interactions may
serve roles that we are not adequately assessing. For instance,
maternal behaviors and pup interaction are of critical importance
to successful adult female behavior in rats, and increased
pup-centered behaviors often coincides with adolescence in
females41. Moreover, both the familiarity of a conspecific animal
(i.e., a prior cage mate or novel female) as well as the social
context (i.e., home cage or novel cage) have been demonstrated to
influence female play behavior33,42. Thus, we propose that to
understand the molecular mechanisms governing female NAc
(and greater reward circuitry) development, we first need to
identify the repertoire of experiences that are most salient to that
sex. The importance of changes in social exploration observed
here will provide an excellent foundation on which to begin this
exploration.
Many sex differences in neurodevelopment and behavior,
including sex-specific social behavior, are established by a surge of
male sex hormones (androgens) in male, but not female fetuses
around the time of birth37,43. Remarkably, in regions of the brain
known to develop highly sexually dimorphic neural architecture,
the effects of androgen masculinization at birth is mediated
indirectly through microglia and immune signaling44,45. Con-
sistent with the engagement of microglia and immune signaling
specifically in the male brain early in life to mediate sexual
organization, a recent report indicates that the human tran-
scriptome in neocortex displays higher phagocytosis-related and
immune-related gene expression in males than in females prior to
birth, which then switches to a higher female bias after birth46.
Intriguingly, in this same dataset, there was another age at which
males again demonstrated higher immune gene expression

 relative to females: late childhood to early-adolescence. Here, we
demonstrate that the male, but not female NAc, engages classical
immune signaling to refine dopaminergic circuitry during ado-
lescent development. Collectively, these data raise the possibility
that the preferential engagement of immune-mediated mechan-
isms is pre-programmed, potentially via early-life masculinization
events, to serve male development. Our data demonstrate that
interfering with C3–C3R immune interactions with NIF blocks
developmentally-programmed D1r downregulation and increases
social play behavior in a D1r-dependent manner in P30–38
adolescent males. While D1r downregulation in females did not
require C3–C3R interactions, and females did not demonstrate
any overt changes in social play behavior over the course of
adolescence, P22 NIF treatment nevertheless increased social play
behavior, in a D1r-independent manner. Because behavioral
changes only arise in females when the molecular milieu of the

Fig. 5 C3–C3R regulation of D1rs regulates male, but not female, social play behavior. To determine if disrupting C3–C3R interactions via NIF increases play
in a D1r-dependent manner, we utilized siRNA against rat D1r (200 µM) or scRNA controls. a P30 males were co-injected with NIF + D1r siRNA in one
hemisphere and NIF + scRNA in the contralateral hemisphere, and then D1r immunoreactivity was assessed at P38. b In the presence of NIF, D1r siRNA
was capable of decreasing D1r levels relative to NIF + scRNA within-animal control hemispheres (~20%; Table 5A). c P22 females were injected with NIF
+ D1r siRNA in one hemisphere and NIF + scRNA in the contralateral hemisphere, and then D1r immunoreactivity was assessed at P30. d In the presence
of NIF, D1r siRNA was capable of decreasing D1r levels relative to NIF + scRNA within-animal control hemispheres (~30%; Table 5B). Representative
images precede histograms; scale bar equals 100 µm. n = 3/sex. e Experimental design: P30 males and P22 females were bilaterally microinjected into the
NAc with either Vehicle + scRNA (Veh sc), Vehicle + D1r siRNA (Veh si), NIF + scRNA (NIF sc), or NIF + D1r siRNA (NIF si). At P37 and P22, animals
were single-housed for 24 h, and then a novel age- and sex-matched conspecific was introduced into their home cage for 10 min social behavior tests (n =
9–10/sex/treatment). Males: f NIF + scRNA increased social play behavior in males, which was eliminated by D1r siRNA (NIF si; Table 5C). g No treatment
changed social exploration behavior (Table 5D). Females: h NIF + scRNA increased social play behavior in females, which was not affected by D1r siRNA
(NIF si; Table 5E). i No treatment changed social exploration behavior (Table 5F). Immunohistochemical data were calculated as in Fig. 2 and analyzed with
two-tailed one-sample t-tests. Behavioral data were analyzed with one-way ANOVAs and Holm-Sidak’s post-hoc comparisons. Histograms portray the

 NAc is tampered with, in our case via local NIF injections, we
hypothesize that these data demonstrate a homeostatic, main-
tenance role for C3–C3R interactions in the female NAc which
modify basal levels of social play behavior during adolescent
development. In contrast, males exhibit concurrent peaks in C3
and D1r, colocalized C3-D1r immunoreactivity contacted by
microglia and internal to microglial lysosomes in the NAc, and a
decline in social play behavior, all between P30–38. Moreover, we
present evidence that C3–C3R interactions mediate the devel-
opmentally programmed decreases in both D1rs and social play
behavior during adolescence in males. Thus female neural
development may accomplish largely the same phenotypic and
functional outcomes (i.e., appropriate D1r and social behavior
maturation), by employing starkly different mechanisms, a phe-
nomena also observed in sex differences in pain processing47 and
analgesia48. As with the interpretation of our behavioral data
discussed above, we suggest that to understand sex-specific
development at a molecular and behavioral level, we may need
sex-specific experimental approaches and techniques.
Importantly, other neuromodulator/neurotransmitter systems
are regulated in adolescence49, and neuropeptides commonly
associated with social behavior, like oxytocin, endocannabinoids,
and opioids, have been demonstrated to modulate social behavior
when manipulated locally in the amygdala, NAc, and VTA in
rodents8,50,51, as well as intra-nasally in humans52. Moreover, D1
is not the only important dopamine receptor mediating reward
circuitry dynamics. In particular, D1rs and D2rs, are largely
thought to be complementary. While both are G-protein coupled
receptors that respond to dopamine, D1rs stimulate cAMP sig-
naling, and thus have an “excitatory” effect in the cell; conversely,
D2rs inhibit cAMP production, resulting in an “inhibitory”
effect53. Thus the ratio of these receptors is important for exci-
tatory:inhibitory balance, and having a complete understanding
of the sex-specific regulation of these complementary receptors
will be important. Indeed, our data cannot rule out the possibility
that there are changes in D1r transcription and translation, or
compensatory changes in D2rs or other neural receptors, medi-
ated by immune signaling. Additionally, there is a well-defined
anatomical and functional dissociation between the shell and core
of the NAc54. We defined our regions of interest not by core vs.
shell, but by D1r immunoreactivity. Thus, while we are likely
studying D1r dynamics in the core (i.e. immediately dorso-medial
to the anterior commissure), we cannot exclude contributions
from the shell. Interestingly, while core vs. shell distinctions are
unquestionably important for some behaviors, dopamine signal-
ing supporting social play does not appear to have a core vs. shell
dependency7. Additionally, we focused our analyses primarily to
the anterior NAc. There is an interesting anterior-posterior NAc
dichotomy, in which the anterior NAc processes reward and
posterior NAc processes aversion in humans55 and rodents56.
Given its different functions and the notion that adolescents
experience both reward augmentation and dampened aversion57,
it will be important to determine if the development of the NAc is
not unitary, but rather utilizing different mechanisms and/or
different timescales along the anterior-posterior axis.
Finally, complement signaling involves a complex cascade of
protein activation, either via the classical, lectin, or alternative
pathways, all ultimately converging on the enzymatic cleavage of
complement C3 into the iC3b fragment, which then acts as an
opsonin and is a ligand of C3R/CD11b58,59. While it is clear that
C3 and C3R are critical for neurodevelopment as well as engaged
in pathology, how C3 expression and its proteolytic processing is

 regulated in the brain is unknown. Importantly, the complement
cascade is not the only means of eliminating synapses and
refining neural circuitry. Other immune protein families like the
major histocompatibility component (MHC) family60, other cell
types (astrocytes in particular)61, C3R-independent synaptic
remodeling and pre-synaptic trogocytosis by microglia19, and
immune-independent mechanisms (e.g., retraction due to com-
petition62 or GABAA receptor-mediated elimination63) have all
been implicated in synaptic elimination. Interestingly, there is
also evidence for neuro-glial communication guiding immune-
mediated neural circuit refinement64, and thus the molecular
network which regulates C3-mediated elimination is likely to be
far more complex than we currently appreciate. Irrespective of its
upstream mediators, immune-mediated synaptic remodeling and
elimination appears to be engaged in several models of neuro-
logical disorders including virus-induced cognitive dysfunction24,
healthy aging23, and Alzheimer’s disease21,22, suggesting this
natural developmental mechanism may be over-activated in
pathology.
Our data raise many important questions, and point to several
unexplored lines of inquiry for future exploration. Intriguingly, a
recent report demonstrated different microglial signatures within
different regions of the reward circuitry65, and understanding
how these structures develop in concert and cooperate to mediate
behavioral outcomes will be revolutionary for our understanding
of adolescent vulnerabilities to neuropsychiatric disorders. While
challenging in practice, moving toward an experimental frame-
work that assesses more than one signaling pathway and/or brain
regions in parallel can reveal unappreciated cooperation in the
service of behavior66, and will ultimately be required to fully
understand the development of this system.
Methods
Animals. Either adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (both age postnatal
day 70–75 (P70–75)) were purchased to be breeding pairs, or pregnant females
were purchased ~7 days prior to giving birth (Harlan/Envigo, Dublin, VA). Ani-
mals were group-housed in individually ventilated cages with ad libitum access to
food (Purina lab Diet 5001) and water. The colony was maintained at 23 °C on a
12:12 light-dark cycle (lights on at 07:00 h) and cages were changed once per week.
Females were separated from males prior to birth. Litters were culled to a max-
imum of 12 pups per litter on P2–5, and at P21 pups were weaned into same sex
pair-housing (2–4 rats per cage). For behavioral experiments, conspecific animals
were purchased to be age- and sex-matched (Harlan/Envigo, Dublin, VA). PFA-
fixed D1-tdTomato mouse brains were a generous gift from the Lobo lab at
University of Maryland School of Medicine, and PFA-fixed D1r knock out and
wildtype mouse brains were a generous gift from the Caron lab at Duke University.
All experiments and animal care was approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committees at Duke University and the Massachusetts General Hospital.
Tissue collection. Animals were euthanized at the ages indicated in each experi-
ment by CO2 anesthesia and exsanguination. Blood was collected prior to exsan-
guination via cardiac puncture, and then 0.9% saline was perfused until blood was
cleared. Animals were decapitated and brains extracted. For immunohistochemical
experiments, brains were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. In
surgically manipulated animals with immunohistochemical endpoints, perfusion
with 4% PFA followed saline perfusion. Whole brains were then incubated in 4%
PFA for 24 h at 4 °C. The remaining surgically manipulated animals were subjected
to social play testing, and then euthanized after behavioral testing.
Immunohistochemistry. PFA-fixed brains were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in
0.1 M PB for at least 2 days. Cryoprotected brains were rapidly frozen in molds
with Tissue Tek on dry ice, and then cryosectioned at 20 μm. Four animals from
different litters were represented in each experimental group. Sections were stored
in 0.1 M PB with sodium azide (0.1%) until processing. After washing in PBS,
sections were incubated at 80 °C for 30 min in 10 mM citric acid (pH 9.0) for
epitope retrieval. Background fluorescence was quenched sequentially with 30 min
incubations in 1 mg/mL sodium tetraborate in 0.1 M PB and then 50% methanol.
Tissue was permeabilized for 1 h with 0.3% Triton-x100 in PBS and then blocked in
10% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch; West Grove, PA) in PBS
for 1 h. Primary antibodies were applied sequentially for overnight incubations in
5% normal donkey serum in PBS at 4 °C: either anti-goat C3 (MP Biomedicals
#0855713; Santa Ana, CA; 1:200), anti-mouse D1r (Novus Biologicals
#NB110–60017; Littleton, CO; 1:750), anti-rabbit Iba1 (Wako Chemicals
#019–19741; Richmond, VA; 1:1500) or anti-rabbit CD68 (Abcam #ab125212;
Cambridge, MA; 1:5000), anti-goat C3, anti-mouse D1r. Secondary antibodies were
applied simultaneously for the C3-D1r-Iba1 triple stain (Donkey anti-goat Alexa
Fluor (AF) 647, anti-mouse AF 488, anti-rabbit AF 563; Thermo Fisher Scientific,
each 1:500) for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. For the CD68-C3-D1r triple
stain, CD68 was amplified prior to proceeding with the subsequent primary
incubations. Tissue was incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit (Vector Labora-
tories; Burlingame, CA; 1:1000) for 2 h at room temperature, in Avidin-Biotin
Complex solution for 30 min at room temperature (Vector Laboratories; Burlin-
game, CA), and then Tyramide Signal Amplification fluorescein reagent (Perki-
nElmer) for 10 mins at room temperature in the dark. After washing, the tissue was
then incubated sequentially with C3 and D1r antibodies, and then incubated with
secondary antibodies (anti-goat AF 563, anti-mouse AF 647; Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific, 1:500) for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. All tissue was mounted on
gelatin subbed slides, coverslipped with ProLong Antifade Mounting media
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), sealed with nailpolish, and stored at −20 °C until
imaging.
Image acquisition and volumetric reconstructions. One to three z-stacks
(depending on the size of the ROI, see Supplementary Fig. 1B) per section within
the D1r-rich region of the NAc were acquired on a Nikon A1SiR confocal
microscope with 60x magnification and 0.1 μm step size (n = 4 animals per group,
two sections per animal). Importantly, male and female tissue required different
imaging parameters and thus are analyzed and graphically depicted separately. For
these reasons, no direct comparisons between males and females can be made from
these data. While exhibiting the same visual features used to select the NAc (i.e.,
rhinal fissure size and corpus callosum shape), female ROIs tended to be smaller
than males, and thus fewer z-stacks were taken from female tissue (specific dif-
ferences detailed in Table 1). Background was subtracted and threshold values were
recorded using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health; Bethesda, MD). These files
were then uploaded into Imaris (Bitplane; Zurich, Switzerland) to create volumetric
reconstructions of (i) each individual channel, (ii) C3-D1r colocalization, and (iii)
“masked” C3, D1r, and C3-D1r. The masking application refers to the use of one
channel as a 3D outline, or mask, on which all other channels are superimposed. If
other channels are within this 3D mask, they are considered in contact with or
contained within the masking channel. For example, Iba1-masked D1r volume
would constitute all D1r volumes that are either within (i.e., engulfed) or directly
contacted by microglia, whereas a CD68-masked D1r volume constitutes all D1r
volumes within a CD68+ lysosome. Total volumes for each channel reconstructed
in Imaris (a maximum of 24 values across four different animals per group) were
then used for statistical analysis.
Ex vivo microglial assays. For then phagocytosis assay, microglia were isolated
from minced adult female brains (n = 4) according to Hanamsagar et al67. Briefly,
tissue was enzymatically and mechanically disrupted and then myelin and debris
removed via Percoll gradient centrifugation. Resulting cell bodies were incubated
with anti-rat CD11b (i.e., microglia-specific) magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec
#130–105–634; Auburn, CA) and then separated from the CD11b- population via
magnetic columns. CD11b+ cell numbers were estimated on a hemocytometer,
and 75,000 cells per well were incubated on 12 mm glass coverslips (Thermo Fisher
Scientific #12–545–80) in media (1% L-glutamine, 1% Pen-Strep, 1% N2 media, 1%
sodium pyruvate, 0.1% forskolin in DMEM) at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 75 min with
either vehicle, 60 ng (1x reconstitution; 200 μg/mL in PBS) neutrophil inhibitory
factor (NIF), or 120 ng (2x reconstitution; 400 μg/mL in PBS) NIF (R&D Systems
#5845-NF-050; Minneapolis, MN). Each condition was performed in duplicate.
Fluorescbrite YG carboxylate microspheres (1μm diameter; Polysciences, Inc.;
Warrington, PA) were added 1:1000 to each well and plates were re-incubated for
90 min. Immunocytochemistry was performed as in Derecki et al.68 Coverslips
were fixed with 4% PFA for 20 min at room temperature, and then washed in PBS.
Coverslips were blocked and permeabilized for 1 h at room temperature (10%
normal donkey serum, 0.5% BSA, 0.3% Triton x-100 in PBS), and then incubated
with rabbit anti-Iba1 antibody (1:700; Wako Chemicals #019–19741; Richmond,
VA) overnight at 4 °C. After washing in PBS, coverslips were incubated with
donkey anti-rabbit AF 563 (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 h at room
temperature, washed, and mounted with Pro-Long Antifade Mounting media with
DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images comprised of DAPI, TexasRed (Iba1),
and GFP (beads) were acquired at 20x magnification with a Zeiss AxioImager
microscope equipped with a z-drive, Apotome optical dissector, and AxioCam
HRm (Carl Zeiss Inc., Gottingen, Germany). Three 5-step (0.5 μm) z-stacks were
acquired for each coverslip, and average z-projections were created using ImageJ
(National Institutes of Health; Bethesda, MD).
For the NIF incubation timecourse, microglia from adult female brains (n = 3)
were isolated, combined, and cultured as described above in media with 60 ng (1x
reconstitution; 200 μg/mL in PBS) NIF for either 30, 60, or 120 min. Each condition
was performed in duplicate. Coverslips were fixed with 4% PFA for 20 min at room
temperature, and then washed in PBS. Coverslips were blocked and permeabilized
for 1 h at room temperature (10% normal donkey serum, 0.5% BSA, 0.3% Triton x-
100 in PBS), and then incubated sequentially, first with rabbit anti-6xHis antibody
(1:700; Abcam ab9108; Cambridge, MA) then with mouse anti-CD11b (1:700;

 EMD Millipore CBL1512; Burlington, MA), both overnight at 4 °C. After washing
in PBS, coverslips were incubated with donkey anti-rabbit AF 488 and donkey anti-
mouse 563 (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 h at room temperature, washed,
and mounted with Pro-Long Antifade Mounting media with DAPI (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Images comprised of DAPI, TexasRed (CD11b), and GFP (NIF) were
acquired at 40x magnification with a Zeiss AxioImager microscope equipped with a
z-drive, Apotome optical dissector, and AxioCam HRm (Carl Zeiss Inc., Gottingen,
Germany). Three 7-step (0.3μm) z-stacks were acquired for each coverslip, and
average z-projections were created using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health;
Bethesda, MD).
Stereotaxic microinjection. Male (P30 or P54) and female (P22 or P54) rats were
maintained under isofluorane anesthesia for the entire surgical procedure (2–3%;
VetEquip; Livermore, CA). The scalp was cut midsagittally and Bregma was
marked, after which two bilateral holes drilled at AP + 2.25 mm, ML ± 2.5 mm, DV
−5.75 mm coordinates in P30 males, AP + 2.35 mm, ML ± 2.55 mm, DV -6.5 mm
in P54 males, AP + 2.7 mm, ML ± 2.4 mm, DV -5.55 mm in P22 females, and AP
+ 2.4 mm, ML ± 2.45 mm, DV −6.05 mm in P54 females (Supplementary Fig. 2). A
Hamilton syringe (Hamilton #7105; Reno, NV) was lowered to depth at a 10° angle
and left in place for 1 min. NIF (1x reconstitution, 200 μg/mL NIF; R&D Systems;
Minneapolis, MN) or vehicle (sterile PBS) was injected at a rate of 50 nL/min (60
ng in 300nL in P30 males, 70 ng in 350 nL in P54 males, 50 ng in 250 nL in P22
females, and 60 ng in 300 nL in P54 females). For scRNA and siRNA experiments,
pre-validated sequences for rat (either control or D1r-specific) were purchased
from ThermoFisher Scientific. The scRNA was a Silencer Select negative control
(catalog #4390843), and the siRNA ID was s127671 (catalog #4390771). A final
concentration of 200 µM sc/siRNA was co-injected with either NIF or vehicle at the
same volumes listed above. The syringe was left in place for 5 min for diffusion, and
then retracted and the procedure repeated on the other hemisphere. Saline was
used to wet the scalp, and then the wound was closed with surgical staples and
coated topically with Bupivicaine. An injection of Ketofen (5 mg/kg) was admi-
nistered subcutaneously and the animal was placed in a clean cage with a food
pellet and gelatinized water for recovery. After 2–3 h, the animal was re-paired with
its cagemate and monitored for the next 48 h. Right versus left hemisphere and
drug versus vehicle injections were counterbalanced, and the syringe was thor-
oughly cleaned with cleaning solution (Hamilton cleaning concentrate, Hamilton;
Reno, NV) and distilled water before being used for the next surgery, or in the case
of within-animal vehicle vs. NIF treatment, between injections. Injection coordi-
nates and volumes were estimated with bromophenol blue dye in water and
immediate decapitation, and an effective D1r siRNA dose was determined
experimentally.
To performthe in vivo NIF timecourse, P54 females were unilaterally
microinjected with NIF as described above, and tissue was collected 1, 3, and 5 days
post-injection. Immunohistochemistry was performed as described above with
anti-6x His tag antibody (Abcam #ab9108; 1:5000) and TSA amplification, and
images were collected with confocal microscopy as described above with 40x
magnification.
Social behavior assessment. Animals were handled on 3 occasions (~5 min
per session) prior to any behavioral tests. Experimental animals were single-house
for 24 h at age P21, P29, P37, or P53, while age-matched and sex-matched con-
specifics were always group-housed (2–3 animals/cage). Social play tests were
performed in the 3 h prior to the dark cycle (1600–1900) as follows: experimental
and conspecific animals were each weighed and then the conspecific animal was
placed in the experimental animal’s home cage. Ten minutes of behavior was
recorded using ANY-maze software (ANY-maze Behavioral tracking software;
Wood Dale, IL), after which the conspecific animal was returned to its cage. When
testing females, the experimental animal was inspected for a vaginal opening, and if
appropriate, estrous smears were taken and later classified as metestrus, diestrus,
proestrus, estrus phases of the estrous cycle according to Goldman et al.69 Behavior
initiated by the experimental animal over the first 9 min of the test was scored by a
blinded investigator using Solomon Coder software (András Péter; solomoncoder.
com). Social behaviors were determined following Manduca et al.7
(i)
Percentage of time spent in social play, which included any classical play
posturing (i.e., nape attacks, supine, and pins) in addition to pouncing on the
conspecific, play boxing, and any rough-and-tumble play bouts.
(ii)
Percentage of time spent in social exploration, which included grooming or
sniffing the conspecific animal.
(iii)
The number of nape attacks, supine positions, pin positions, and
miscellaneous play elicitations (i.e., boxing, pouncing away from the neck,
crawling over or under the conspecific).
Conspecific animals were never litter mates with the experimental animal and
no more than +/−2 days different in age. Weight differences between the animals
varied; however, difference in body weight did not correlate with total play scores
(Supplementary Fig. 3) in males or females at any age.
Statistical analysis. Data points greater than two standard deviations above the
group mean were excluded as outliers. All data were analyzed, and figures created
with, GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software; La Jolla, CA). Data are depicted in
histograms as average ± standard error of the mean with individual data points
overlaid. All statistics are located in Table 1 and Table S1.
Immunohistochemical analyses were performed as follows: the levels of all
proteins assessed (D1r, C3, and Iba1) changed significantly over development
(Fig. 1). Thus, increased microglial contact of these proteins could result from
three mechanisms: (i) higher D1r (or C3/C3-D1r) levels might make microglial
contact more likely due to the increased space occupied by D1rs; (ii) higher Iba1
levels may increase D1r contact by the same principle; or (iii) microglia may be
actively contacting D1rs irrespective of fluctuating D1r or Iba1 levels. Each
target protein (D1r or C3) was normalized for z-stack size, then masked volumes
were calculated as a percentage of the total possible volume for each channel
(i.e., masked D1r divided by total D1r), and divided by the percentage of Iba1
volume in the z-stack to account for changing levels of total Iba1. To assess
association with CD68+ lysosomes, masked protein was calculated as a
percentage of total possible volume. One-way ANOVAs were performed for all
developmental time course data (i.e., P20, 30, 38, 54). In the event of significant
ANOVAs, post-hoc Holm-Sidak t-tests were conducted (two-tailed). Because (a)
immunofluorescent data needed to be acquired at different imaging parameters
for males and females and (b) we were interested in sex differences in patterns of
expression and behavior over development, and not sex differences at any one
age, we did not incorporate sex as an independent variable, and rather
performed a one-way ANOVA for each sex. For the analysis of D1r expression in
NIF-treated and vehicle-treated NAc within the same animals, paired t-tests
(two-tailed) were conducted.
For the phagocytosis assay, cell bodies were outlined by an experimenter
blinded to the conditions using a merged DAPI and Iba1 image in the ROI
manager of ImageJ. Densitometric measurements of the GFP channel (beads), were
then acquired using the pre-set ROIs. One value (the average integrated GFP
density for cells in each image) for each of 3 z-stacks, for each of 2 coverslips, for
each of 4 animals, resulted in 24 data points. A one-way ANOVA was conducted,
followed by Holm-Sidak post-hoc t-tests (two tailed). For the NIF timecourse assay,
densitometric measurements of the GFP and TxRed channels were acquired and
normalized for number of cells present in the image. One value per channel (the
average integrated density for each image) for each of 3 z-stacks, for each of 2
coverslips, resulted in 6 data points per condition. A one-way ANOVA was
conducted for both the GFP (NIF) and TxRed (CD11b) data.
For behaviorial analyses, duration of social play and social exploration were
calculated as a percent of the total testing period (500–540 s), frequency of play
postures was calculated for nape attacks, supine, pin, miscellaneous play elicitation,
and total play actions, and then one-way ANOVAs were conducted separately for
males and females. When appropriate, Holm-Sidak post-hoc t-tests (two tailed)
were conducted. In bilateral NIF- and vehicle-treated animals, behavior was
analyzed with unpaired t-tests (two-tailed). Pearson’s r was calculated to determine
if change in weight from conspecific or estrous stage was significantly correlated
with social behaviors.
