ognitive impairment occurs in up to 83% of stroke survi-
vors and is associated with reduced quality of life, accel-
erated functional decline, and increased risk of dependent 
living and mortality.1–3 Given the lack of successful pharma-
ceutical treatments for cognitive decline and dementia, iden-
tifying alternative treatment strategies that mitigate cognitive 
deficits after stroke is a public health imperative.
Physical activity (PA) holds promise as a widely acces-
sible, low-cost treatment that may preserve or restore 
cognitive abilities poststroke. Randomized controlled tri-
als suggest that structured PA training improves cogni-
tive function in other populations susceptible to cognitive 
decline, including neurologically healthy older adults4 and 
those with dementia.5 According to data from randomized 
controlled trials, stroke survivors may also achieve cogni-
tive gains through PA training. One meta-analysis to date 
has synthesized data from randomized controlled trials to 
quantitatively evaluate the impact of PA training on cog-
nitive outcomes poststroke.6 Results revealed a small but 
significant benefit of PA training on a domain-general 
estimate of global cognition across the 9 included studies. 
However, since this publication in 2012, the number of PA 
intervention trials investigating this relationship in stroke 
survivors has nearly doubled.7–13 Furthermore, in contrast to 
earlier studies14–19, cognition has been the primary outcome 
of interest in recent trials, and thus, more comprehensive 
neuropsychological batteries have been used.9–12,20 Given the 
increase in available data, an updated quantitative synthesis 
incorporating the latest studies and investigating the domain 
specificity of PA effects on cognition is warranted. In addi-
tion to characterizing the effects of PA training on cognition 
after a stroke, there is also a need to identify the population 
characteristics and particular training parameters that may 
generate the largest cognitive gains.
Here, we provide a meta-analytic review of the effects of 
PA training on cognition in stroke survivors. In addition to 
determining whether cognition is enhanced with PA training, 
we also examine whether PA has broad or selective effects on 
Background and Purpose—Despite the social, health, and economic burdens associated with cognitive impairment poststroke, 
there is considerable uncertainty about the types of interventions that might preserve or restore cognitive abilities. The 
objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of physical activity (PA) training on 
cognitive function poststroke and identify intervention and sample characteristics that may moderate treatment effects.
Methods—Randomized controlled trials examining the association between structured PA training and cognitive performance 
poststroke were identified using electronic databases EMBASE and MEDLINE. Intervention effects were represented by 
Hedges’ g and combined into pooled effect sizes using random- and mixed-effects models. Effect sizes were subjected to 
moderation analyses using the between-group heterogeneity test.
Results—Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria, representing data from 736 participants. The primary analysis yielded a 
positive overall effect of PA training on cognitive performance (Hedges’ g [95% confidence interval]=0.304 [0.14–0.47]). 
Mixed-effects analyses demonstrated that combined aerobic and strength training programs generated the largest cognitive 
gains and that improvements in cognitive performance were achieved even in the chronic stroke phase (mean=2.6 years 
poststroke). Positive moderate treatment effects were found for attention/processing speed measures (Hedges’ g [confidence 
interval]=0.37 [0.10–0.63]), while the executive function and working memory domains did not reach significance (P>0.05).
Conclusions—We found a significant positive effect of PA training on cognition poststroke with small to moderate treatment 
effects that are apparent even in the chronic stroke phase. Our findings support the use of PA training as a treatment strategy to 
promote cognitive recovery in stroke survivors.

cognitive function by assessing 3 domains characteristically 
affected in stroke: executive function, attention and process-
ing speed, and working memory. Finally, for the first time, we 
evaluate study and sample characteristics that might moderate 
the efficacy of PA training, including intervention length, the 
mode of PA, and time from stroke onset to initiation of the 
intervention. Determining the particular intervention and pop-
ulation characteristics that are most likely to maximize cogni-
tive gains could have important implications for cognitive and 
functional recovery after a stroke.
Methods
Search Criteria
We conducted a systematic search of the literature using electronic 
databases MEDLINE and EMBASE for human studies published in 
English or Chinese in peer-reviewed journals from the earliest avail-
able record up to November 14, 2016. The keywords of the search 
were combined with the following terms: (physical activity OR phys-
iotherapy OR fitness OR aerobic OR exercise OR resistance training) 
AND (cognitive function OR cognition OR attention OR memory 
OR executive function OR neuropsychological test) AND (stroke OR 
cerebrovascular accident OR brain ischemia OR poststroke OR post-
stroke). Reference lists from included articles were manually exam-
ined to identify other potentially relevant manuscripts.
Study Selection
Studies were selected for inclusion according to the following cri-
teria: (1) recruitment of stroke survivors ≥18 years old (ischemic 
or hemorrhagic stroke, any location, number of strokes), (2) ran-
domized controlled trials that included a clearly defined control 
condition and an experimental condition that included a compo-
nent that aimed to increase PA (aerobic exercise, resistance train-
ing, or physiotherapy), (3) duration of training >4 weeks to provide 
sufficient time for benefits to accrue, and (4) included a validated 
neuropsychological test of cognition with data reported at baseline 
and postintervention. Because of the limited number of studies, no 
restrictions were placed on the characteristics of control groups. 
Studies including subjects with other neurological conditions were 
excluded unless separate data were provided for the stroke subset. 
For studies in which training participation was not monitored (ie, 
home-based), a change in physical function from pre- to postint-
ervention, represented by changes in performance on objective PA 
or fitness tests, must have been observed. This was to increase the 
likelihood that adherence to PA recommendations were followed. 
Two studies included in a prior meta-analysis6 did not meet these 
inclusion criteria and were excluded from the present study (see the 
online-only Data Supplement).
Data Collection and Extraction
One member of the research team (L.E. Oberlin) performed the initial 
search and removed titles and abstracts that were clearly outside of 
the scope of the review. Two members of the research team (L.E. 
Oberlin and A.M. Waiwood) independently assessed remaining titles 
and abstracts and obtained the full text for all abstracts that (1) did 
not provide enough data for exclusion or (2) appeared potentially 
eligible for inclusion. L.E. Oberlin and A.M. Waiwood then inde-
pendently assessed full text articles and selected studies for inclu-
sion based on information within the full text. Any conflicts in article 
selection were resolved by consensus among the primary raters, and 
Dr Erickson was consulted if further clarification was required. Data 
were extracted from the full texts by one member of the review team 
(L.E. Oberlin) using a standard template and was independently veri-
fied by a second member of the research team (A.M. Waiwood). The 
extracted data included study, participant, and intervention charac-
teristics and cognitive outcome data (for more detail, see the online-
only Data Supplement). To achieve a high standard of reporting, we 
followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.21
Quality Assessment
The methodological quality of included trials was evaluated using 
the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool.22 The Cochrane collaboration speci-
fies 6 potential sources of bias, including sequence generation, 
allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, 
incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting. Risk of 
bias and quality of evidence were independently assessed by 2 mem-
bers of the research team (L.E. Oberlin and A.M. Waiwood) and was 
rated per domain based on the published study reports (or, if appli-
cable, based on information from related protocols) as low, unclear 
(insufficient detail or not reported), or high risk of bias, according 
to Section 8.5 of the Cochrane handbook.22 This tool is commonly 
used to assess bias in PA intervention studies and conforms to the 
PRISMA guidelines.21
Calculation of Effect Sizes
Data were entered into an electronic database and analyzed using 
Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, version 2.23 Intervention 
effects of each study were represented by Hedges’ g, a bias-adjusted 
estimate of the standardized mean difference that applies an addi-
tional correction for small sample sizes. Hedges’ g was calculated 
by subtracting the mean change in performance from baseline in 
the control group from the experimental group and dividing the dif-
ference by the pooled standard deviation of the change from base-
line. Using Cohen’s criteria, effect sizes were interpreted as small 
(≤0.2), moderate (0.5), or large (≥0.8).24 Weighted mean effect size 
values, along with standard errors and 95% confidence intervals 
(CI), were estimated using random-effects or mixed-effects mod-
els. Random-effects models are considered more conservative than 
a fixed-effects approach and assume that the true treatment effect 
may differ across studies because of expected variations in sample, 
intervention, and assessment characteristics. Mixed-effects mod-
els were used for all moderation analyses because this approach 
assumes that variability between studies may be attributable to 
fixed and random components, as well as subject-level sampling 
error.25 Data were analyzed using an intent-to-treat framework, and 
therefore, sample sizes at baseline, rather than postintervention, 
were considered in the calculation of effect size. The sign of the 
effect was calculated so that positive effect sizes were indicative of 
an improvement in cognitive performance among the experimental 
groups, relative to controls.
Quantitative Data Synthesis and Analysis
Using a random-effects model, we first assessed whether participa-
tion in PA training resulted in significant cognitive gains relative to 
control samples. For trials reporting multiple cognitive outcomes, 
effect sizes were calculated separately for each test and averaged 
together to obtain an overall effect size estimate for each study. This 
approach ensured that each study was represented by no more than 
one effect size and allowed us to assess the overall or domain-general 
effect of PA on cognition poststroke. Heterogeneity was evaluated 
using the chi-squared (Q) and I2 statistics, according to procedures 
outlined in the Cochrane handbook.22 Consistent with these guide-
lines, a P value of <0.10 indicated statistically significant heterogene-
ity between studies.
In addition, several a priori analyses were conducted to investi-
gate whether sample and study characteristics moderate the effects 
of PA training on cognitive performance. Intervention character-
istics included trial duration (<3 months or ≥3 months), mode of 
exercise (aerobic, stretching and toning/physiotherapy, or combined 
aerobic and stretching and toning), and type of cognitive assessment 
(objective versus subjective). We also examined whether the time 
from stroke to initiation of the intervention (≤3 months poststroke, 
>3 months poststroke) affected the magnitude of the effect size. 
Moderation effects were analyzed in mixed-effects models using the

between-group heterogeneity (QB) test, which provides an estimate of 
the between-groups variance. Significance was set at P<0.05.
We also evaluated whether there were domain-specific effects of 
PA training on cognitive performance. Of the 14 studies included in 
the meta-analysis, 5 used multiple neuropsychological assessments 
that could be classified into different cognitive domains. Studies were 
not represented by a single effect size; instead, an effect size esti-
mate was calculated for all cognitive outcomes within each study. The 
analysis included tests that could be classified into the following cate-
gories: attention and information processing speed, working memory, 
and executive function (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement).
Finally, a post hoc subgroup analysis assessed the overall effect of 
PA training on cognitive performance among studies that screened for 
and included participants with motor impairments (eg, chronic hemi-
paresis, including upper or lower limb paralysis, inability to walk 
without an assistive device [cane, walker]). This allowed us to assess 
whether stroke survivors with significant motor limitations were able 
to engage in PA training to the extent needed to generate cognitive 
gains.
Results
Characteristics of Included Studies
The initial search yielded a total of 956 potentially relevant 
studies, which was further refined to the retrieval of 143 full-
text articles. Of these, 14 randomized controlled trials met all 
inclusion criteria, representing data from 736 participants. 
The study selection process, including reasons for exclusion 
at the full-text level, is summarized in a PRISMA study flow 
diagram (Figure 1). All included studies had been published 
between November 2000 and October 2016. The studies 
varied in size, duration, and intervention type. Study sizes 
ranged from 14 to 156, and the average age was 62.5 (6.44), 
with a large range across studies (21–80 years). Mean age 
was similar across PA (61.93; SD, 6.62) and control groups 
(63.11; SD, 6.67). Men comprised ≈59% of the sample 
across all studies. Among the PA training conditions, 5 stud-
ies involved stretching and toning/physiotherapy without a 
primary aerobic component, 3 trials consisted only of aero-
bic exercise training (eg, treadmill, bicycle training), and 6 
studies included a combined PA training program, involving 
a mixture of both aerobic exercise and stretching and toning 
activities. Six studies included control groups that received 
standard medical practice or wait-list control, 2 studies con-
tained an active control condition that did not involve any 
form of PA (social communication, progressive muscle 
relaxation), and 6 studies included a control condition that 
involved PA without a primary aerobic component (stretch-
ing, toning, and balance). The effect size estimates strati-
fied by control group can be found in the online-only Data 
Supplement (Table II in the online-only Data Supplement).
The average time since stroke was ≈1.9 years (range 1 
week to 5.1 years). Regarding stroke characteristics, all but 3 
studies7,12,20 included subjects with ischemic and hemorrhagic 
stroke subtypes. Recurrent stroke was an exclusion criterion 
in 4 studies.7,10,15,20 In 7 studies, those with a history of demen-
tia or probable clinically significant cognitive impairment 
were excluded,7,9,13,14,17,18,20 and in 3 studies, individuals with 
mild cognitive impairment or dementia were included.10,12,16 
Baseline cognitive status was not reported in 4 studies.8,11,15,19 
Attrition occurred in 8 studies and ranged from 3% to 18%.

the online-only Data Supplement (Table III in the online-only 
Data Supplement).

Quality Assessment 
In total, 2 of the 14 studies were judged to be of high method-
ological quality because they scored positively on all 6 of the 
quality criteria. The remainder of studies varied in the amount 
of methodological detail reported, with several quality indices 
not fully discussed in many trials. Information on allocation 
concealment was not reported in 50%, and blinding of partici-
pants and study assessors was not reported in 57% and 21% 
of trials, respectively. The randomization method led to a high 
risk of bias in only 1 of the included studies. Although attrition 
occurred in 8 studies, only 2 met criteria for high risk of bias 
in outcome reporting according to the Cochrane guidelines. 
Details on the methodological quality of each study are pre-
sented in the Table. Selective outcome reporting did not seem 
to occur in any of the included studies and was, therefore, not 
included in the Table.
Effects of PA Training on Cognition
Using data from 14 randomized controlled trials, we first 
investigated whether stroke survivors experienced cognitive 
gains after structured PA training relative to controls. Results 
revealed a significant and positive effect of PA training on 
cognitive performance, with a small to moderate mean effect 
size (Hedges’ g [CI] =0.304 [0.14–0.47]; P<0.001; Figure 2). 
The significance remained when any 1 trial was removed from 
the analysis. The assumption of homogeneity was met for the 
full sample (Q (df)=15.36 (13); P=0.29).
Moderation Analyses
Intervention and Outcome Characteristics
Mixed-effects analysis revealed that longer intervention tri-
als were not associated with a greater magnitude of cogni-
tive gains relative to brief interventions (QB=0.82; P=0.367).

Specifically, PA training lasting <3 months (Hedges’ g [CI] 
=0.39 [0.14–0.63]) and interventions involving at least 3 
months of PA training (Hedges’ g [CI] =0.23 [0.01–0.46]) 
were associated with improvements in cognitive performance 
compared with controls (Figure 3).
To assess the influence of the type of training, studies were 
stratified based on whether the PA training involved (1) a com-
bination of aerobic and strength/balance training (6 studies; 
297 participants), (2) aerobic exercise only (3 studies; 158 par-
ticipants), or (3) stretching/toning/balance training without an 
aerobic component (5 studies; 281 participants). Participants 
in combined strength and aerobic training programs expe-
rienced the largest cognitive benefits (Hedges’ g [CI] =0.43 
[0.09–0.77]), although cognitive gains were also apparent 
among subjects who underwent a PA regimen involving only 
strength/balance training (Hedges’ g [CI] =0.28 [0.05–0.52]). 
The effect size for aerobic-only trials was not significantly dif-
ferent from zero (Hedges’ g [CI] =0.16 [−0.15 to 0.47]), and 
the between-groups difference did not reach statistical signifi-
cance (QB=1.35; P=0.508).
The type of cognitive assessment was significant such that 
positive, moderate effects were observed among studies that 
used objective cognitive assessments (Hedges’ g [CI] =0.39 
[0.18–0.59]), while the pooled effect size for trials using sub-
jective cognitive measures did not significantly differ from zero 
(Hedges’ g [CI] =0.16 [−0.09 to 0.40]). However, the interaction 
effect did not reach statistical significance (QB=1.93; P=0.165).
A post hoc subgroup analysis assessed whether cognitive 
gains were observed specifically in studies that screened for 
and included subjects with mobility limitations, including 
chronic hemiparesis and an inability to ambulate without an 
assistive device. Across the 8 included studies, results revealed 
a moderate, positive treatment effect in favor of the PA group 
(Hedges’ g [CI] =0.33 [0.10–0.56]; I2=0%).
Time From Stroke to Intervention
We also investigated whether the magnitude of cognitive 
gains differed depending on when a PA regimen was intro-
duced in the course of stroke recovery. Among the 4 studies 
initiated within 3 months poststroke (382 participants), one 
started PA training within 1 week poststroke,18 one began, 
on average, 3 weeks after a stroke,15 and 2 began ≈6 to 10 
weeks poststroke,14,16 with a pooled average of ≈35 days post-
stroke. The time from stroke to intervention among the 10 tri-
als including chronic stroke survivors (>3 months poststroke;

of Hedges’ g reflect improvements in

354 participants) ranged from 3 months to nearly 5 years, 
with an approximate overall average of 2.62 years since 
stroke onset.
Results indicated that PA training introduced in the chronic 
stroke phase resulted in significant, moderate, and positive 
effects on cognition (Hedges’ g [CI] =0.43 [0.20–0.65]), 
while the effect size for trials that initiated PA training within 
3 months poststroke was not significantly different from zero 
(Hedges’ g [CI] =0.16 [−0.04 to 0.36]). However, mixed-effects 
analysis did not demonstrate a significant between-group dif-
ference. Effect size estimates were statistically homogenous 
within subgroups for all moderation analyses, aside from the 
combined training subgroup (I2=51.44; P=0.069). Primary 
and moderation analyses are represented in Figure 3 and in 
Table II in the online-only Data Supplement.
Subgroup Analysis: Domain Specificity
We also examined the domain specificity of PA training. This 
mixed-effects analysis consisted of 24 effect sizes derived 
from 5 studies that used comprehensive neuropsychological 
batteries, representing data from 153 participants. Analyses 
were conducted on 10 measures of executive function, 9 
assessments of attention/processing speed, and 5 measures 
of working memory, yielding a pooled effect size estimate 
for each domain. The overall effect size across all 3 domains 
was 0.22 (CI=0.07–0.38; P=0.005). Of the 3 domains, effects 
were only significantly different from zero for attention and 
processing speed (Hedges’ g [CI] =0.37 [0.10–0.63]) and 
not for executive function (Hedges’ g [CI] =0.11 [−0.11 to 
0.33]) or working memory (Hedges’ g [CI] =0.27 [−0.13 to 
0.67]; Figure 4). When subjected to a between-group analysis, 
results revealed no significant difference in effect size across 
the 3 domains (QB=2.18; P=0.336).
Discussion
Poststroke cognitive impairment has gained increased atten-
tion in recent years because of its high prevalence, persis-
tence, and implications on health, quality of life, and recovery 
among stroke survivors. Our results indicate that PA training 
enhances cognitive performance after a stroke. In particular, 
small to moderate cognitive gains were achieved among stroke 
survivors who participated in structured PA training relative to 
controls. These findings suggest that PA may reduce the bur-
den of cognitive deficits in stroke survivors.
One prior meta-analysis assessed the effects of PA training 
on cognitive outcomes in stroke and found a small but sig-
nificant benefit of structured PA training across the 9 included 
studies. Seven additional randomized controlled trials were 
published since this review, which allowed us to expand on the 
previous meta-analysis in several important ways. Specifically, 
we were able to impose stricter inclusion criteria, excluding 
studies with mixed populations and interventions consisting 
of a single bout of PA. Furthermore, we were able to (1) inves-
tigate factors influencing the efficacy of PA interventions and 
(2) evaluate and characterize the effects of PA training on dif-
ferent cognitive domains. We found that PA training resulted 
in moderate, positive improvements on measures of attention 
and processing speed, while the executive function and work-
ing memory domains did not reach statistical significance.
The findings should be interpreted with caution, however, 
as one study was overrepresented in the analysis because of 
the inclusion of a larger cognitive battery, and the working 
memory effect size estimate was based on only 5 evaluations. 
Furthermore, it is possible that exercise may improve per-
formance in cognitive domains that are not well represented 
in the current literature, including language, visuospatial, 
and memory abilities, and may also preferentially influence 
subtypes of executive function. Therefore, this study is an 
important first step in elucidating domain-specific effects of 
PA training. However, future randomized controlled PA trials 
using detailed cognitive assessments of both global and focal 
(eg, aphasia, hemispatial neglect) cognitive deficits are needed 
to confirm and expand on these findings.
We evaluated several moderators to characterize the fea-
tures of PA interventions that may maximize cognitive gains. 
Mixed-effects analysis demonstrated that PA had favorable 
effects regardless of program length. Importantly, this sug-
gests that participation in brief structured PA programs is 
sufficient to induce cognitive gains. However, trials that were 
longer in duration (≥3 months) tended to involve fewer PA 
sessions per week, suggesting that a frequency-duration trade-
off may have also contributed to the lack of effect size differ-
ences between the 2 groups.
We also investigated differences in effect size as a function 
of type of PA training. Our analysis indicated that strength/
balance training and interventions that combined both aerobic 
and strength training protocols achieved significant effects, 
although the effect size for combined trials was nearly double 
that of strength/balance training–only studies. Interventions 
involving only aerobic exercise did not result in significant 
cognitive gains, although we may have been insufficiently 
powered to detect an effect in this subgroup (n=3 studies). 
The relative superiority of combined interventions is consis-
tent with findings in healthy aging4 and has also been shown to 
yield the largest improvements in quality of life among stroke 
survivors.26 Our results suggest that combined aerobic and 
strength training programs may generate the largest cognitive 
gains and support the recent guidelines highlighting the need 
for cardiovascular exercise protocols to be integrated into stan-
dard subacute and chronic stroke rehabilitation programs.27
There are likely many cellular and molecular mechanisms 
by which PA influences cognitive function. Animal mod-
els have shown that aerobic exercise after a stroke increases

brain-derived neurotropic factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, 
synaptogenesis, and dendritic branching,28 reduces lesion vol-
ume in affected regions, and protects perilesional tissue from 
inflammation and oxidative damage.29 Exercise training soon 
after stroke also exerts greater effects on many of the afore-
mentioned processes than delayed initiation of PA training.28,29 
Yet, here, only trials that introduced PA >3 months after stroke 
onset demonstrated a significant overall treatment effect. 
The modest effect size among trials introducing PA within 
3 months poststroke may, in part, be a consequence of the 
small number of studies conducted within this time frame (4 
studies; 382 participants), as well as the exclusive use of sub-
jective neuropsychological assessments in half of the trials. 
According to our moderation analyses, subjective measures 
may not be as sensitive as objective assessments at detecting 
PA-induced changes in cognitive performance. Furthermore, 
2 of the studies did not include an aerobic component, and 
only 1 trial involved a combined strength and aerobic train-
ing program. Determining whether cognitive recovery can be 
maximized by introducing PA during this critical window of 
heightened neuroplasticity constitutes an important focus for 
future work.
We report that PA training is capable of improving cogni-
tive performance in chronic stroke. Participants within this 
subgroup began PA training, on average, ≈2.62 years after 
stroke, and our results showed positive and moderate treat-
ment effects. These findings emphasize the importance of 
including both strength and aerobic training in standard 
postacute rehabilitation programs, including community and 
home-based services, in the interest of promoting cognitive 
recovery in chronic stroke.
Safety is an important consideration in this popula-
tion, particularly given the prevalence of mobility impair-
ments and heightened risk of injury and falls poststroke.27 
Unfortunately, many of the studies included here had inad-
equate reporting regarding adverse events and whether the 
events were serious, expected (eg, muscle soreness), or 
related/unrelated to the intervention protocol (see the online-
only Data Supplement). Eight of the included trials, to some 
degree, reported on adverse events that occurred during 
intervention sessions and found no incidence of injury or 
serious adverse events during PA sessions. Improved report-
ing of adverse events in future studies is critical to determine 
interventions that minimize the likelihood of adverse events 
in this population. Notably, when we exclusively analyzed 
studies that included participants with motor impairments, 
we found that PA training led to improvements in cognitive 
performance that were moderate in magnitude. These results 
indicate that participants with motor deficits were success-
fully able to engage in PA training to such an extent that cog-
nitive gains were achieved. Thus, determining safe, effective, 
and feasible methods of PA training and customizing these 
to the needs and abilities of the patient is an important area 
for future work.
The included studies varied in several population char-
acteristics that we were unable to systematically study 
here but may influence the effect of PA training on cog-
nition. These variables include age, baseline fitness levels, 
stroke characteristics, such as type, severity, and first versus 
recurrent stroke, as well as the presence of comorbid car-
diovascular and mental health conditions. In addition, we 
included trials involving cognitively healthy participants, as 
well as cognitively impaired samples. Favorable effects of 
PA on cognition have been found in neurologically healthy 
older adults,4 as well as in those with dementia,5 so PA train-
ing may exert similar cognitive benefits across a range of 
deficits poststroke. Nonetheless, the extent and specificity 
of PA-induced cognitive changes may differ depending on 
the level of cognitive dysfunction. Finally, many of the stud-
ies that included participants with motor impairments did 
not provide details regarding the specificity of these motor 
deficits, so whether these findings are generalizable to indi-
viduals with more severe mobility limitations is not well 
understood. Overall, further assessment of these population 
characteristics is needed to determine how these factors 
may influence treatment effects.
This literature is marked by methodological limitations, 
with only 2 studies meeting low risk of bias in all 6 quality 
domains. However, the small number of published interven-
tions and inconsistent reporting across trials precluded our 
ability to examine whether these factors may have accounted 
for effect size variance across studies. The nature of the con-
trol group (eg, wait-list control, non-PA, or stretching/ton-
ing) may also impact the magnitude of effect sizes; however, 
we were underpowered to assess this in the present study. 
Similarly, adherence was only sporadically reported and, 
therefore, could not be taken into consideration. Finally, some 
moderation analyses included subgroups containing just 4 or 
5 effect sizes. While there is no fixed minimum number of 
data points required for a meta-analysis, fewer data points 
may limit the precision of pooled estimates as well as the 
power to detect effects, particularly among studies with small 
sample sizes.25
Summary
Results from our quantitative synthesis and analysis indi-
cate that PA training enhances cognitive performance after 
a stroke. We found that cognitive benefits were achieved in 
as little as 12 weeks, and combined intervention programs 
yielded the largest cognitive gains. Further, PA training had 
favorable effects on cognition even when introduced during 
the chronic stroke phase. These findings also highlight sev-
eral critical avenues for future work, including identifying the 
ideal window of time after a stroke and the optimal training 
parameters needed to maximize cognitive recovery. Included 
in these trials should be participants with more severe levels of 
cognitive and physical impairment to enhance generalizability 
and help inform the development of methods to customize PA 
to the needs and abilities of these patients.
