Estimation of national, regional, and global prevalence of 
alcohol use during pregnancy and fetal alcohol syndrome: 
a systematic review and meta-analysis
Svetlana Popova, Shannon Lange, Charlotte Probst, Gerrit Gmel, Jürgen Rehm
Summary
Background Alcohol use during pregnancy is the direct cause of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). We aimed to estimate 
the prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy and FAS in the general population and, by linking these two indicators, 
estimate the number of pregnant women that consumed alcohol during pregnancy per one case of FAS.
Methods We began by doing two independent comprehensive systematic literature searches using multiple electronic 
databases for original quantitative studies that reported the prevalence in the general population of the respective 
country of alcohol use during pregnancy published from Jan 1, 1984, to June 30, 2014, or the prevalence of FAS 
published from Nov 1, 1973, to June 30, 2015, in a peer-reviewed journal or scholarly report. Each study on the 
prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy was critically appraised using a checklist for observational studies, and 
each study on the prevalence of FAS was critically appraised by use of a method specifi
 cally designed for systematic 
reviews addressing questions of prevalence. Studies on the prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy and/or FAS 
were omitted if they used a sample population not generalisable to the general population of the respective country, 
reported a pooled estimate by combining several studies, or were published in iteration. Studies that excluded 
abstainers were also omitted for the prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy. We then did country-specifi
 c random-
eff
 ects meta-analyses to estimate the pooled prevalence of these indicators. For countries with one or no empirical 
studies, we predicted prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy using fractional response regression modelling and 
prevalence of FAS using a quotient of the average number of women who consumed alcohol during pregnancy per 
one case of FAS. We used Monte Carlo simulations to derive confi
 dence intervals for the country-specifi
 c point 
estimates of the prevalence of FAS. We estimated WHO regional and global averages of the prevalence of alcohol use 
during pregnancy and FAS, weighted by the number of livebirths per country. The review protocols for the prevalence 
of alcohol use during pregnancy (CRD42016033835) and FAS (CRD42016033837) are available on PROSPERO.
Findings Of 23 470 studies identifi
 ed for the prevalence of alcohol use, 328 studies were retained for systematic review 
and meta-analysis; the search strategy for the prevalence of FAS yielded 11 110 studies, of which 62 were used in our 
analysis. The global prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy was estimated to be 9·8% (95% CI 8·9–11·1) and the 
estimated prevalence of FAS in the general population was 14·6 per 10 000 people (95% CI 9·4–23·3). We also 
estimated that one in every 67 women who consumed alcohol during pregnancy would deliver a child with FAS, 
which translates to about 119 000 children born with FAS in the world every year.
Interpretation Alcohol use during pregnancy is common in many countries and as such, FAS is a relatively prevalent 
alcohol-related birth defect. More eff
 ective prevention strategies targeting alcohol use during pregnancy and 
surveillance of FAS are urgently needed.

Introduction
Alcohol use can result in harm not only to the drinker, 
but also to other individuals associated with the 
drinker.1 A classic example of this harm to others is the 
harm caused by consuming alcohol during pregnancy. 
Alcohol is a teratogen that can readily cross the 
placenta, resulting in damage to the brain and other 
organs of the developing embryo and fetus. Alcohol use 
during pregnancy has been established as a risk factor 
for adverse pregnancy outcomes including stillbirth,2 
spontaneous abortion,3 premature birth,4–6 intrauterine 
growth retardation,6,7 and low birthweight.6,8 One of the 
most disabling potential outcomes of drinking during 
pregnancy is the risk of developing fetal alcohol 
syndrome (FAS), the most severe and visibly 
identifi
 able form of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder 
(FASD).9–12
FAS, fi
 rst described in 1973,13 is associated with a wide 
range of eff
 ects including permanent brain damage, 
congenital anomalies, prenatal or postnatal growth 
restriction, and characteristic dysmorphic facial features, 
along with cognitive, behavioural, emotional, and

adaptive functioning defi
 cits.9–12,14 We have shown14 that 
individuals with FAS experience many comorbid 
conditions, with the most prevalent conditions occurring 
within the congenital malformations, deformities, and 
chromosomal abnormalities (43%) and mental and 
behavioural disorders (18%) chapters of the International 
Statistical Classifi
 cation of Diseases and Related Health 
Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10).15 Some of these 
comorbid conditions (eg, language, auditory, visual, 
developmental, cognitive, mental, and behavioural 
problems) are highly prevalent in individuals with FAS, 
ranging from 50% to 91%.14 The neurodevelopmental 
impairments associated with FAS can, later in life, lead 
to substantial secondary disabilities (eg, academic failure, 
substance abuse, mental health problems, contact with 
law enforcement, and an inability to live independently 
and obtain and maintain employment) and thus, have 
lifelong 
implications.16 
Moreover, 
FAS 
is 
an 
intergenerational issue, with younger siblings of a 
diagnosed child being at an increased risk of FAS. The 
complexity and chronicity of FAS aff
 ects both the 
individual and their family, and in many cases, people 
with FAS require lifelong assistance from a wide range 
of services including health, community, remedial 
education, and many others. Accordingly, FAS is 
recognised to impart a substantial economic burden on 
society.17–19
To set priorities for public health policy, funding for 
public health initiatives, and health-care planning, it is 
necessary to know the prevalence of FAS and its main 
causal risk factor—alcohol use during pregnancy. 
However, to date, most countries do not have prevalence 
data at a population level for alcohol use during pregnancy 
or for FAS. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, the 
number of pregnant women in the general population 
who consume alcohol during pregnancy per case of FAS 
has not been previously estimated.
Although human research has not been able to 
delineate the pattern, amount, or critical period of 
prenatal alcohol exposure necessary for structural or 
functional teratogenesis, we do know that not every 
woman who drinks during pregnancy will deliver a child 
with FAS. This uncertainty is especially true given that 
there are some other factors at play that might infl
 uence 
a fetus’s vulnerability to the teratogenic eff
 ects of alcohol, 
such as variability in the metabolism and genetic 
background of both the mother and fetus, environmental 
infl
 uences, maternal smoking behaviour, nutritional 
status, stress levels,20,21 and possibly paternal lifestyle.22
To fi
 ll these knowledge gaps, we aimed to estimate the 
prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy and of FAS 
among the general population, by country, WHO region 
(ie, African region [AFR], Eastern Mediterranean region 
[EMR], European region [EUR], region of the Americas 
[AMR], South-East Asia region [SEAR], and Western 
Pacifi
 c region [WPR]), and globally. We also aimed to 
estimate the number of pregnant women in the general 
population who consumed alcohol per one case of FAS 
by linking data on the prevalence of alcohol use during 
pregnancy with data on the prevalence of FAS. With the 
growing body of literature, increased recognition of 
prenatal alcohol exposure and FAS as serious and costly 
public health problems, and advancements in statistical 
techniques, this study is not only now feasible, but also 
urgently needed and timely.
In line with the International Charter on Prevention of 
FASD, published in The Lancet Global Health in 2014,23 
the current study provides the best understanding of the 
scope of the problem at this time and is intended to both 
inform and draw the attention of health-care practitioners, 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Alcohol use during pregnancy is an established cause of fetal 
alcohol syndrome (FAS). To date, most countries do not have 
population-level prevalence data for alcohol use during 
pregnancy or FAS. To fi
 ll these knowledge gaps, we have 
completed the fi
 rst comprehensive epidemiological study to 
estimate the actual (based on existing empirical studies) and 
predicted (for countries with one or no empirical studies) 
prevalence of these indicators. It was also unknown what 
proportion of women who drink during pregnancy will deliver a 
child with FAS.
Added value of this study
This study has estimated that globally, about 10% of women in 
the general population consume alcohol during pregnancy and 
one in 67 women delivered a child with FAS. This fi
 nding means 
that, on average, about 15 of every 10 000 livebirths worldwide 
will have FAS, translating to about 119 000 children born with 
FAS globally every year. In some regions (most notably in the 
WHO European Region) a high proportion (about a quarter) of 
pregnant women in the general population consume alcohol 
during pregnancy, which is mirrored by also having the highest 
FAS prevalence that is 2·6 times higher than the global average 
(14·6 per 10 000; 95% CI 9·4–23·3). In countries of the WHO 
Eastern Mediterranean Region and South-East Asia Region, 
where the rates of abstinence are very high, the prevalence of 
alcohol use during pregnancy and FAS was estimated to be the 
lowest.
Implications of all the available evidence
More eff
 ective prevention strategies targeting alcohol use 
during pregnancy and surveillance of FAS are urgently needed. 
Future eff
 orts should be made to obtain countries’ own 
prevalence data on alcohol use during pregnancy and FAS, 
which will provide a basis for public health policy, health-care 
planning, and resource allocation for FAS prevention initiatives.

Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
We began by systematically reviewing the literature on the 
prevalence of alcohol use (of any amount) during 
pregnancy. The search terms were: alcohol, binge, OR 
ethanol; 
AND 
behavi*, 
consum*, 
OR 
drink*; 
AND 
maternal, 
mother, primigravida, OR wom*n; AND pregnant, 
pregnanc*, OR prenatal; AND epidemiology, frequenc*, 
occurrence, OR prevalence. We searched multiple 
electronic bibliographic databases to identify studies 
published between Jan 1, 1984, and June 30, 2014 (ie, in the 
past 30 years), without language and geographic restriction, 
including: Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse Library 
Collection Database, Campbell Collaboration, CINAHL, 
Cochrane 
Database 
of 
Systematic 
Reviews, 
CSA 
Sociological Abstracts, Embase, ERIC, Google Scholar, 
MEDLINE, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and 
Alcoholism’s Alcohol and Alcohol Problems Science 
Database, PsycINFO, Scopus, Social Work Abstracts, and 
Web of Science (including Science Citation Index, Social 
Sciences Citation Index, and Arts and Humanities Citation 
Index). Subsequently, we searched the content pages of 
major epidemiology journals (ie, International Journal of 
Epidemiology, European Journal of Epidemiology, and 
American Journal of Epidemiology) and screened citations in 
any of the relevant articles in order to identify additional 
studies. We included articles if they consisted of original 
quantitative research published in a peer-reviewed journal 
or scholarly report, and reported the prevalence of alcohol 
use during pregnancy among the general population of 
the respective country. We omitted articles if they excluded 
abstainers from the sample or estimate, used a sample 
population not generalisable to the general population of 
the respective country (ie, on a sample drawn from a 
special population—for example, Indigenous women, 
adolescents, women of a low socioeconomic status, women 
with HIV, and women with an alcohol use disorder), 
reported a pooled estimate of alcohol use during pregnancy 
by combining several studies, or were published in 
iteration. In cases where a study reported more than one 
prevalence estimate of alcohol use during pregnancy, we 
gave preference to the estimate obtained after pregnancy 
recognition (rather than before recognition), during the 
entire pregnancy (instead of just one trimester), within 
6 weeks post partum, or using a validated method for 
identifi
 cation of alcohol use.
We then did a systematic literature review to identify all 
studies that reported the prevalence of FAS. A 
comprehensive systematic literature search was done to 
identify all studies that have reported the prevalence of 
FAS among the general population of the respective 
country. The search terms were: epidemiolog*, frequenc*, 
incidence*, morbidit*, occurren*, prevalence*, probability, 
rate*, OR statistic*; AND alcohol* embryopath*, fas, fetal 
alcohol syndrome*, foetal* alcohol syndrome*, prenatal* 
alcohol expos*, OR pre-natal* alcohol expos*; AND cohort 
stud*, cross* sectional stud*, prospective cohort stud* OR 
retrospective cohort stud*. We searched multiple electronic 
bibliographic databases, including: CINAHL, Embase, 
ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science 
(including Science Citation Index, Social Sciences Citation 
Index, and Arts and Humanities Citation Index). The 
search was not limited geographically or by language of 
publication, and identifi
 ed all studies published from 
Nov 1, 1973 (when FAS was fi
 rst described)13 to 
June 30, 2015. The search was limited to human studies in 
all databases that allow for this restriction to be specifi
 ed. 
We manually reviewed the content pages of the major 
epidemiological journals in paediatrics (ie, Paediatric and 
Perinatal Epidemiology, Pediatrics, and JAMA Pediatrics), 
and the citations in any of the relevant articles in order to 
identify additional studies. Articles were retained if they 
consisted of original, quantitative research published in a 
peer-reviewed journal or scholarly report, and reported the 
prevalence of FAS with either a measure of uncertainty (CI 
or SE), or the sample size, or number of cases. We excluded 
articles if they used a sample not generalisable to the 
general population of the respective country (ie, on a 
sample drawn from a special population—for example, 
Indigenous and correctional populations, children in care, 
and children born to women with an alcohol use disorder), 
reported a pooled estimate by combining several studies, 
or were published in iteration.
We began the study selection for both systematic reviews 
by screening titles and abstracts for inclusion. Then, we 
considered full-text articles of all studies screened as 
potentially relevant. Two investigators, SP and SL, did each 
study selection step independently; any disagreements 
were reconciled by team discussion. In cases where 
multiple studies used the same dataset or cohort, we 
included the study with the larger sample size. SL extracted 
data and then a second investigator, SP, independently 
crosschecked these data for accuracy against the original 
studies. All discrepancies were reconciled by team 
discussion. Non-English-language studies deemed to be 
potentially relevant were translated either by colleagues 
fl
 uent in the respective language or using the Google 
Translate (and subsequently crosschecked by a native 
speaker). A protocol is available on PROSPERO for the 
systematic review and meta-analysis on alcohol prevalence 
in pregnancy (CRD42016033835) and for the prevalence of 
FAS (CRD42016033837).
Meta-analyses
SP and SL independently appraised the quality of each 
study using a checklist for observational studies 
developed on the criteria described and validated by 
Wong and colleagues.24 Investigators assessed the 
representativeness of the sample (probability vs non-
probability sampling), adequate sample size (n≥300), 
method used to ascertain alcohol use during pregnancy

(validated method vs questionnaire), and adequate 
response or participation rate (≥70%; appendix pp 21–26). 
All discrepancies in quality ratings were reconciled by 
team discussion.
For countries with two or more empirical studies, we did 
country-specifi
 c random-eff
 ects meta-analyses25 to estimate 
the pooled prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy. 
Before doing the meta-analyses, prevalence estimates were 
transformed using a double arcsine transformation 
(appendix p 1).26 Heterogeneity between estimates was 
assessed using the Cochrane Q test27 and the I² statistic.28 
Publication and selection bias was tested by: visually 
inspecting the funnel plot (the SE plotted against the point 
estimate) for a skewed distribution, using a rank correlation 
test, evaluating the correlation between observed point 
estimates and corresponding sampling variances,29 and 
employing a weighted regression test for disproportionate 
small-study infl
 uence.30 For countries with one or no 
empirical studies (or where the meta-analysis resulted in a 
CI of 0–100%), we predicted the country’s prevalence of 
alcohol use during pregnancy by using a fractional response 
regression modelling (ie, a generalised linear model with a 
binomial family and a logit link) to restrict predictions to 
values between zero and one.31 Country-specifi
 c predictor 
variables were gross domestic product (GDP) adjusted for 
purchasing power parity per capita (obtained from the 
World Bank),32 mean total consumption of alcohol among 
women (obtained from WHO Global Information System 
on Alcohol and Health),33 and the WHO region within 
which the country is located. In regard to WHO regions, we 
split WHO EUR and WHO AMR into high-income and 
low-income regions (ie, European Union [EU] member 
states vs non-EU-member, and Canada and USA vs all 
remaining countries in the Americas, respectively). Other 
explanatory variables that we considered for inclusion are 
presented in the appendix (p 1).
Predictions of the prevalence of alcohol use during 
pregnancy were made for the year 2012. The standard 
error for each country estimate was based on the variation 
between studies of the meta-analysis. All meta-analyses 
and the fractional response regression modelling were 
performed using R version 3.2.2.34
For the meta-analysis of FAS prevalence, we critically 
appraised each study using a method specifi
 cally used in 
systematic reviews addressing questions of prevalence.35 
The studies were assessed by use of the following ten 
criteria: studies needed to show representativeness of the 
sample to the general population; appropriate recruitment 
of participants; adequate sample size (n≥300); well 
described participants and setting; suffi
  cient coverage of 
the identifi
 ed sample; use of an objective, standard 
criterion for measuring FAS; reliability of condition 
measurement; the use of appropriate statistical analysis; 
identifi
 cation 
and 
consideration 
of 
confounders, 
subgroups, and diff
 erences; and the use of objective 
criteria for the identifi
 cation of subpopulations (appendix 
pp 37–38). SP and SL independently appraised the quality 
of each study, and all discrepancies in quality ratings were 
reconciled by team discussion.
To estimate the pooled prevalence of FAS for countries 
with two or more observational studies, we did country-
specifi
 c random-eff
 ects meta-analyses, as described for the 
prevalence of drinking during pregnancy. For the pooled 
prevalence of FAS, we did primary and secondary analyses. 
For the primary analysis we included studies that used 
active case ascertainment (ACA; in which cases are actively 
sought 
and 
diagnosed) 
or 
clinic-based 
methods 
(prospectively done in prenatal clinics or hospitals) and 
specifi
 ed the diagnostic guideline or case defi
 nition used 
to ascertain cases. We did a secondary analysis using less 
restrictive inclusion criteria and, in addition to those 
studies included in the primary analysis, also included 
studies that made use of passive surveillance methods (the 
use of existing record collections—eg, birth certifi
 cates, 
registries, medical charts, adoption records) and did not 
provide the diagnostic guideline or case defi
 nition used.
For countries with one or no empirical studies (or where 
the meta-analysis resulted in a CI of 0–100%), we predicted 
the prevalence of FAS using data on the prevalence of 
alcohol use during pregnancy. This method included the 
following steps: fi
 rst, we estimated a quotient for the 
average number of pregnant women who consumed 
alcohol per one case of FAS for countries with available 
data and then we predicted prevalence of FAS by applying

this quotient to the country-specifi
 c prevalence of alcohol 
use during pregnancy. To derive the CI for the point 
estimate of the prevalence of FAS, we applied the Monte 
Carlo method,36 generating 1 000 000 samples per country 
and using the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of the resulting 
distribution as the CI (appendix pp 2–3). The Monte Carlo 
simulations were done using Python version 2.7
.12.37
To estimate the prevalence of alcohol use during 
pregnancy and FAS by the six WHO regions and globally, 
we calculated a weighted average of the prevalence of 
alcohol use during pregnancy and FAS weighting by the 
number of livebirths in each country for the latest 
available year (2000–14).38 To determine the uncertainty 
around these point estimates, we drew 1 000 000 samples 
from each country’s specifi
 c distribution and we 
calculated 
the 
corresponding 
1 000 000 
weighted 
averages. The 2·5th and the 97·5th percentiles of the 
resulting distribution of averages were used as the CI.

Results
For the prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy in 
the general population, of 23 470 studies, we found 
328 studies contained relevant data and were retained for 
data extraction (fi
 gure 1). Data on the prevalence of 
alcohol use during pregnancy in the general population 
were available from 50 countries, representing all 
six WHO regions. The study characteristics and the 
prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy among the 
general population reported in the identifi
 ed studies are 
presented in the appendix (pp 4–16).
We estimated the prevalence of alcohol use during 
pregnancy among the general population via random-
eff
 ects meta-analyses for 29 countries and via fractional 
response modelling for 158 countries (ie, countries with 
one or no empirical studies; fi
 gure 2; appendix pp 17–19). 
The fi
 ve countries with the highest estimated prevalence of 
alcohol use during pregnancy were Russia (36·5%, 95% CI

18·7–56·4), UK (41·3%, 32·9–49·%), Denmark (45·8%, 
30·9–61·2), Belarus (46·6%, 42·4–50·7; based on 
prediction), and Ireland (60·4%, 42·8–76·8); all of which 
belong to WHO EUR. The fi
 ve countries with the lowest 
prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy (ie, 0%) were 
Oman, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and 
Kuwait (all of which belong to WHO EMR, and are based 
on prediction). The average prevalence of alcohol use 
during pregnancy was the highest in the WHO EUR at 
25·2% (95% CI 21·6–29·6) and the lowest in the WHO 
EMR at 0·2% (0·1–0·9; table). The global prevalence of 
consuming any amount of alcohol during pregnancy in the 
general population was estimated to be 9·8% (8·9–11·1). 
The results of the tests of heterogeneity and publication 
bias for meta-analyses on the prevalence of alcohol use 
during pregnancy are presented in the appendix (p 20).
With regard to the prevalence of FAS in the general 
population, 
the 
search 
strategy 
initially 
yielded 
11 110 studies, 62 of which contained relevant data and 
were retained for data extraction (fi
 gure 3). Data on the 
prevalence of FAS among the general population were 
available from 19 countries, representing four WHO 
regions (AFR, AMR, EUR, and WPR). 22 studies used 
ACA, 20 used passive surveillance, 14 studies were clinic-
based, and six studies used a mixed-methods approach. 
In total, 40 studies used an established FAS diagnostic 
guideline or provided the case defi
 nition used to ascertain 
cases. The study characteristics and prevalence of FAS 
among the general population reported in the identifi
 ed 
studies are presented in the appendix (pp 28–31).
We estimated the pooled prevalence of FAS among the 
general population via random-eff
 ects meta-analyses for 
seven countries and via applying a quotient of the average 
number of women who consumed alcohol during 
pregnancy per one case of FAS for 180 countries 
(fi
 gure 4). The fi
 ve countries with the highest prevalence 
of FAS per 10 000 people were Belarus (69·1, 95% CI 
42·1–103·5; based on prediction), Italy (82·1, 42·1–134·6), 
Ireland (89·7, 50·4–142·8; based on prediction), Croatia 
(115·2, 
34·8–236·0), 
and 
South 
Africa 
(585·3, 
430·7–761·7). The fi
 ve countries with the lowest 
prevalence of FAS (ie, <0·05 per 10 000 people; based on 
prediction) 
were 
Oman, 
United 
Arab 
Emirates, 
Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Kuwait (WHO EMR). In line 
with the prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy, the 
prevalence of FAS was the highest in WHO EUR 
(37·4 per 10 000 people, 95% CI 24·7–54·2) and the 
lowest in the WHO EMR (0·2 per 10 000 people, 0·2–0·9; 
 
table). The global prevalence of FAS among the general 
population was estimated to be 14·6 per 10 000 people 
(95% CI 9·4–23·3; appendix pp 32–34). The results of the 
tests of heterogeneity and publication bias for meta-
analyses on the prevalence of FAS are presented in the 
appendix (p 35). On the basis of data for the seven 
countries (Australia, Canada, Croatia, France, Italy, 
South Korea, and USA) with the prevalence of both 
alcohol use during pregnancy and FAS available, we 
estimated that one in every 67 mothers who consumed 
alcohol during pregnancy delivered a child with FAS, 
which translates to approximately 119 000 children born 
with FAS in the world each year (based on a total of 
81 536 534 livebirths worldwide; the sum of the number 
of livebirths for each country for the latest available year 
[2000–14]).38 The results of the secondary analysis 
described in the methods are presented in the appendix 
(p 36).
Overall, the secondary analysis resulted in lower point 
estimates of the prevalence of FAS for those countries with 
available studies that made use of passive surveillance or 
did not specify the diagnostic guideline or case defi
 nition 
used (ie, Australia, France, Italy, and USA). This fi
 nding 
was expected since it has been shown that ACA is the most 
eff
 ective approach to estimating the prevalence of FAS.39

Discussion
This study estimated that on average about 15 of every 
10 000 people worldwide will have FAS. For the USA, the 
prevalence of FAS exceeds that of other birth defects 
such as anencephaly, spina bifi
 da, and trisomy 18, and is 
similar to trisomy 21 (Down’s syndrome).40 Furthermore, 
globally, about 10% of women in the general population 
consume alcohol during pregnancy, and one of every 
67 of these women delivered a child with FAS. This 
fi
 nding is corroborated by previous research, which 
estimated that 4·3% of children born among heavy-
drinking pregnant women (defi
 ned as an average of two 
or more drinks per day, or fi
 ve to six drinks per occasion) 
will have FAS41—ie, one of every 23 heavy-drinking 
pregnant women will deliver a child with FAS, which is 
about three times greater than the quotient estimated 
among women in the general population who consumed 
any amount of alcohol during pregnancy.
Despite public health eff
 orts to eliminate or reduce the 
consumption of alcohol during pregnancy in many 
countries (see, for example, clinical guidelines advising 
women to abstain during pregnancy in Australia,42 
Canada,43 Denmark,44 France,45 and USA46 as well as WHO 
guidelines for identifi
 cation and management of substance 
use in pregnancy),47 the results of the current study indicate 
that in some regions (most notably, WHO EUR), a high 
number of pregnant women continue to consume alcohol. 
Alarmingly, about a quarter of women in the general 
population of Europe drink alcohol during pregnancy, 
which, as one would expect, is mirrored by also having the 
highest FAS prevalence—a prevalence that is 2·6 times 
higher than the global average. The lowest prevalence of 
alcohol use during pregnancy and FAS was found in the 
WHO EMR (50 times lower than the global average) and 
WHO SEAR (fi
 ve times lower than the global average). 
This is unsurprising given the cultural factors in these 
regions, which prescribe female abstinence (eg, for WHO 
EMR most of the population is of Muslim faith, a religion 
associated with very high rates of abstention from alcohol). 
Furthermore, the prevalence of FAS in South Africa is 
notably high in relation to the prevalence of alcohol use 
during pregnancy. This can be explained that in general, 
the WHO AFR has a low prevalence of heavy episodic 
drinking of 16·4%,48 but alcohol consumption per capita

among drinkers aged 15 years or older is extremely high 
(ie, 19·5 litres). Therefore, those women who consume 
alcohol during pregnancy are most likely to practise the 
most detrimental pattern of drinking (ie, binge drinking), 
which is a direct cause of FAS.
We would like to highlight two important aspects of 
this study. First, this study estimated the prevalence of 
only one alcohol-related diagnosis (ie, FAS) that falls 
under the FASD umbrella (which includes partial FAS 
and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, in 
addition to FAS).9 It is believed that the prevalence ratio 
of FAS to FASD is about one to nine or ten, indicating 
that FAS is only the tip of the iceberg.49 Second, the 
estimates presented in this report are for the general 
population of the respective countries. However, the 
prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy has been 
reported to be much higher among some at-risk 
populations. For example, the prevalence of alcohol use 
during pregnancy among Inuit women in northern 
Quebec (QC, Canada) was reported to be 60·5%, which 
is over ten times higher than the estimate for the general 
population of Canada.50 Similar to alcohol use during 
pregnancy, the prevalence of FAS is also much higher 
among some populations. For example, Fitzpatrick and 
colleagues51 have reported the prevalence of FAS in an 
Indigenous population in Australia to be 92·6 per 10 000 
(approximately 39 times higher than in the general 
population), and Strömland and colleagues52 have 
reported a prevalence of 3191 per 10 000 people for FAS 
in children residing in an orphanage in Brazil (>14 times 
higher than in the general population).
Regardless of the preventable nature of FAS, there is 
reason to believe that its prevalence could increase around 
the globe in the coming years. This speculation is 
primarily based on two factors: fi
 rst, the rates of alcohol 
use, binge drinking, and drinking during pregnancy are 
increasing among young women in a number of 
countries,53,54 and second, a large percentage of pregnancies 
in developing and developed countries are unplanned.55–58 
Unplanned pregnancies can put embryos at risk of being 
unintentionally exposed to alcohol in the earliest stage of 
pregnancy, when brain and facial development are 
particularly vulnerable to its eff
 ects.59,60
The current study has several notable strengths, namely 
the comprehensive search strategies, strict inclusion and 
exclusion 
criteria, 
critical 
appraisals, 
rigorous 
identifi
 cation of dual publications (thereby avoiding any 
potential of double counting cases), analytical strategy, 
and 
innovative 
evidence-based 
statistical 
analysis. 
However, this study is not without its limitations. First, 
some studies included in meta-analyses of the prevalence 
of alcohol use during pregnancy used non-representative 
sampling strategies, or did not use validated tools to 
ascertain alcohol use. Yet it has been shown that non-
probability sampling strategies can be an acceptable 
sampling technique when exploring exposures during 
pregnancy61 and that a single question can detect as many 
(if not more) women who drink as can other commonly 
used prenatal screens.62 Second, data on alcohol use 
during pregnancy were obtained through self-reported 
measures and as such, are vulnerable to reporting and 
recall biases. Therefore, the prevalence of alcohol use 
during pregnancy and, as a consequence, the prevalence 
of FAS, might be underestimated in the current study. 
Third, drinking patterns (frequency and quantity) were 
not included in the current analysis because these data 
were either not reported or reported inconsistently across 
the included studies. However, such information would 
be important in advising future clinical and research 
practice and for developing appropriate FAS prevention 
strategies. Fourth, with regard to the FAS prevalence 
studies, many studies did not use or specify the diagnostic 
guideline or case defi
 nition to ascertain cases and those 
that used diff
 erent diagnostic guidelines or case 
defi
 nitions. One study63 showed that the FAS diagnosis 
unreliable because of the inconsistency in existing FASD 
diagnostic systems; therefore, the diagnostic guidelines 
used in the included studies are likely to have aff
 ected the 
reported prevalence (the direction of this eff
 ect depends 
on the sensitivity and specifi
 city of the diagnostic system). 
Fifth, the predicted prevalence estimates might diverge 
from the true prevalence because the data from which the 
values are predicted have some measurement error. 
There could also be other relevant explanatory variables 
infl
 uencing the prevalence of alcohol use during 
pregnancy (eg, alcohol guidelines or policies) that were 
not taken into account in the predictions. Sixth, the 
studies on the prevalence of FAS were most often 
regionally confi
 ned and had been done in areas where a 
high prevalence was expected. Even so, the data indicate 
that FAS is a relatively prevalent alcohol-related birth 
defect in those countries where studies have been done. 
Finally, it should also be noted that this study was limited 
to WHO Member States.
Nonetheless, this study used the best available data and 
provides a working estimate of the prevalence of alcohol 
use during pregnancy and FAS in countries that do not 
currently have actual data. These data provide a useful 
indicator of the public health burden of the condition 
and a basis for health policy and resource allocation for 
FAS prevention initiatives. The results of this study 
should inspire countries to do their own research to 
obtain their own prevalence data on alcohol use during 
pregnancy and FAS, and when such data become 
available, further research can refi
 ne the current 
estimates over time.
The current fi
 ndings show that every year more than 
100 000 children are born with FAS worldwide—a 
lifelong disorder with a known and preventable cause. 
The harmful eff
 ects of alcohol on a fetus, representing 
many cases of preventable long-term disability, should be 
recognised globally as a public health problem. The data 
presented here show the urgent need to establish an FAS 
surveillance system to monitor its prevalence throughout

the world. Further eff
 orts should be made to better 
educate women of childbearing age about the risks of 
alcohol use (especially binge and frequent drinking) 
during pregnancy. Moreover, prevention programmes 
aiming to change alcohol use behaviour during and 
before pregnancy—since it greatly aff
 ects the likelihood 
of prenatal drinking64,65—should be implemented around 
the world.
Appropriate screening for alcohol use in all women of 
childbearing age in combination with preconception 
health promotion, contraceptive counselling, and referral 
to substance abuse programmes for those women 
identifi
 ed to have an alcohol use disorder should become 
a routine standard of care in all primary care settings. 
Referrals to substance abuse programmes, if necessary, 
are of the utmost importance as eff
 ective treatment of 
any identifi
 ed cases of alcohol dependence or alcohol use 
disorders could reduce the risk of having a child with 
FAS. In patients in whom it is not possible to detect 
alcohol use before pregnancy, detection of prenatal 
alcohol use should be the focus, as decreasing or 
eliminating the use of alcohol during pregnancy could 
reduce the severity of the eff
 ects on the fetus. As the fi
 rst 
point of contact, physicians and other health-care 
providers are in a position to fulfi
 l a crucial role in the 
primary prevention of FAS and other alcohol-related 
birth defects.
