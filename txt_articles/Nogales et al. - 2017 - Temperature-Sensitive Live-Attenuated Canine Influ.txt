ABSTRACT Canine influenza is a respiratory disease of dogs caused by canine influ-
enza virus (CIV). CIV subtypes responsible for influenza in dogs include H3N8, which
originated from the transfer of H3N8 equine influenza virus to dogs; and the H3N2
CIV, which is an avian-origin virus that adapted to infect dogs. Influenza infections
are most effectively prevented through vaccination to reduce transmission and fu-
ture infection. Currently, only inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) are available for
the prevention of CIV in dogs. However, the efficacy of IIVs is suboptimal, and novel
approaches are necessary for the prevention of disease caused by this canine respi-
ratory pathogen. Using reverse genetics techniques, we have developed a live-
attenuated CIV vaccine (LACIV) for the prevention of H3N8 CIV. The H3N8 LACIV rep-
licates efficiently in canine cells at 33°
C but is impaired at temperatures of 37 to
39°
C and was attenuated compared to wild-type H3N8 CIV in vivo and ex vivo. The
LACIV was able to induce protection against H3N8 CIV challenge with a single intra-
nasal inoculation in mice. Immunogenicity and protection efficacy were better than
that observed with a commercial CIV H3N8 IIV but provided limited cross-reactive
immunity and heterologous protection against H3N2 CIV. These results demonstrate
the feasibility of implementing a LAIV approach for the prevention and control of
H3N8 CIV in dogs and suggest the need for a new LAIV for the control of H3N2 CIV.
IMPORTANCE Two influenza A virus subtypes has been reported in dogs in the last
16 years: the canine influenza viruses (CIV) H3N8 and H3N2 of equine and avian ori-
gins, respectively. To date, only inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) are available to pre-
vent CIV infections. Here, we report the generation of a recombinant, temperature-
sensitive H3N8 CIV as a live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), which was
attenuated in mice and dog tracheal, explants compared to CIV H3N8 wild type. A
single dose of H3N8 LACIV showed immunogenicity and protection against a homol-
ogous challenge that was better than that conferred with an H3N8 IIV, demonstrat-
ing the feasibility of implementing a LAIV approach for the improved control of
H3N8 CIV infections in dogs.

nfluenza A viruses (IAVs) are enveloped viruses that belong to the Orthomyxoviridae
family and contain a genome that comprises eight single-stranded negative-sense
RNA segments that encode 10 to 14 proteins (1). The hemagglutinin (HA) and the
neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins are the major antigenic determinants of IAV and are
essential for receptor binding and fusion and virion release, respectively (2). IAV HA and
NA glycoproteins within infected organisms and populations are driven to evolve
antigenic variants via immunological pressure and in humans and some other hosts

 positive selection of viruses occurs gradually in a process known as antigenic drift (3).
The antigenic diversity of glycoproteins is used to further classify IAVs, of which there
are 18 HA and 11 NA subtypes (4, 5). In addition, antigenically distinct isolates can also
exist within the same subtype, referred to as drifted variants. IAVs exist mainly in the
wild aquatic fowl reservoir (6–9), and only a small number of mammalian hosts are
currently recognized as sustaining transmission of IAVs.
Canine influenza is a contagious respiratory disease of dogs caused by two IAVs: the
H3N8 equine-origin influenza virus that transferred to dogs in the United States around
1999 (10) and the avian virus-like H3N2 that transferred to dogs in Asia around 2005
(11). In 2015 an outbreak of H3N2 canine influenza virus (CIV) occurred in the United
States that was due to a virus similar to those detected in dogs in Asia (12). The H3N2
CIV has also been isolated from cats in a shelter in South Korea (13, 14). These CIVs
represent new threats to canine health in the United States and worldwide, since the
virus may be spread through the racing track circuit, as was the case of the H3N8 strain
(10, 15), while both viruses are spread widely within and among animal shelters and
kennels (10, 16, 17). CIVs are still relatively new viruses and because of the low levels
of infection and immunity among the broader population most dogs are susceptible to
infection. Most dogs infected by CIVs show only a mild respiratory illness, but severe
outcomes are also observed (18).
The recent emergence of CIVs (H3N8 and H3N2 CIVs) has increased the host range
of IAVs. The continuous circulation of CIVs in dog populations creates opportunities for
exposure of humans and other animals. Since dogs are susceptible to mammalian
(equine-origin H3N8 CIV) and avian (avian-origin H3N2 CIV) IAVs, they may have the
potential to act as “mixing vessel” hosts for new IAV strains with potential for human
infection. Reassortments between H3N2 CIVs and human pandemic H1N1 IAV have
been reported (19, 20), and the introduction of novel, antigenically distinct glycopro-
teins (HA and NA) into the backbones of human IAVs have been associated with human
pandemics (21).
Vaccination is accepted as an effective strategy for the prevention of influenza
infections (22, 23). To date, three types of influenza virus vaccines have been approved
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for human use: recombinant viral HAs,
inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs), and live-attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) (22,
24–27). In dogs, only IIV against both H3N8 and H3N2 CIVs are commercially available.
However, we have recently reported the generation of recombinant H3N8 CIVs con-
taining truncated or a deleted nonstructural 1 (NS1) protein as potential LAIVs candi-
dates for the treatment of H3N8 CIV infections (28).
IIVs are administered intramuscularly and elicit humoral immunity by inducing the
production of neutralizing antibodies that target epitopes on HA (26, 29). On the other
hand, LAIVs more closely mimic the natural route of viral infection and elicit both
cellular and humoral immune responses (24), providing better immunogenicity and
protection (22, 28, 30).
In mammals IAV is a respiratory pathogen that replicates in the cooler (33°
C) upper
respiratory tract, in addition to replicating in the warmer (37°
C) conditions of the lower
respiratory tract (31). This temperature difference has allowed for the development of
cold-adapted (ca), temperature-sensitive (ts), attenuated (att) viruses that replicate in
the upper respiratory tract but do not damage the lower respiratory tract due to the
elevated temperatures restricting replication (32). For human viruses these ca, ts, and
att properties have been mapped to five amino acid residues located in three viral
proteins of A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 (A/AA/6/60): polymerase basic 2 (PB2) N265S;
polymerase basic 1 (PB1) K391E, D581G, and A661T; and nucleoprotein (NP) D34G (33,
34). The mechanisms of attenuation are not fully understood but most likely involve
multiple steps in the replication cycle of the virus (32). Importantly, when the ts
signature of A/AA/6/60 was introduced into influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 (PR8) or
A/California/04/09 H1N1 (pH1N1) viruses, a similar ts phenotype was observed in tissue
culture cells and in the mouse model of infection (35–37).

 In order to develop a LAIV for the treatment of CIV H3N8 infections, we introduced
the ts, ca, att mutations identified in the A/AA/6/60 LAIV into CIV H3N8 (referred to
henceforth as LACIV H3N8) using reverse genetics (38). LACIV H3N8 replicated effi-
ciently in vitro at 33°
C but not at 37 or 39°
C. Compared to CIV H3N8 wild-type (WT),
LACIV H3N8 was attenuated ex vivo and in vivo but was able to induce protective
immunity in mice against H3N8 WT upon a single intranasal (i.n.) dose, demonstrating
its feasibility as a safe, immunogenic, and protective LAIV candidate.
RESULTS
Generation and characterization of H3N8 LACIV. We introduced four ts muta-
tions identified in previous studies into the PB2 and PB1 genes of H3N8 CIV (33, 39) (Fig.
1). No mutation was introduced into the viral NP since H3N8 CIV NP already contains
a G at position 34.
To determine whether the mutations introduced into the PB2 and PB1 genes confer
a ts phenotype to the H3N8 CIV polymerase, we performed a minigenome assay. Both
WT and LACIV H3N8 resulted in similar Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) expression levels at
33°
C (Fig. 1B), but Gluc expression was reduced at higher temperatures (37 and 39°
C)
in cells transfected with the H3N8 LACIV plasmids. This shows that those mutations
resulted in a ts phenotype when introduced in the H3N8 CIV, as previously described
for A/AA/6/60 H2N2 and other influenza viruses (35–37).
We next generated an H3N8 LACIV using plasmid-based reverse genetic approaches
(40, 41) and evaluated the viral replication kinetics in MDCK cells infected at a low
(0.001) multiplicity of infection (MOI) and compared them to the WT H3N8 CIV (Fig. 2).
At 33°
C, both WT and LACIV H3N8 grew with the same kinetics and reached similar high
titers (107 FFU/ml) at 48 to 72 h postinfection (p.i.) (Fig. 2A). At higher temperatures (37
and 39°
C), the WT H3N8 CIV replicated at levels similar to those observed at 33°
C, while

plasmid encoding Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) under the control of the canine polymerase I promoter
(cpPol-I Gluc), and 100 ng of a pCAGGS Cypridina luciferase (Cluc) plasmid to normalize transfection
efficiencies. After transfection, cells were placed at 33, 37, or 39°
C, and viral replication and transcription
was evaluated 24 h later by luminescence (Gluc). Gluc activity was normalized to that of Cluc. The data
represent means and SD. Normalized reporter expression is relative to that in the absence of pDZ NP
plasmid. Data were represented as relative activity considering WT H3N8 polymerase activity at each
temperature as 100%. *, P � 0.05 (Student t test).

 H3N8 LACIV titers were reduced ca. 2 to 3 logs at 37°
C (Fig. 2B) or was not detected at
39°
C (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrate that mutations introduced in PB2 and PB1
conferred a ts phenotype to H3N8 CIV.
LACIV H3N8 is attenuated in vivo in mice. Since the H3N8 LACIV presented
defects in replication at higher (37 and 39°
C) temperatures, we next investigated
whether H3N8 LACIV was also attenuated in mice. No signs of infection were detected
after infection with WT H3N8 CIV. Therefore, CIV titers in the lungs of infected (105 PFU)
mice were determined on days 2 (n � 3) and 4 (n � 3) p.i. and used as a measure of
viral attenuation (Fig. 3). Notably, virus titers in the lungs were only detected in mice
inoculated with WT H3N8 CIV, and no virus was detected in mice infected with the
H3N8 LACIV. These results indicate that H3N8 LACIV is also attenuated in vivo.
Intranasal vaccination with H3N8 LACIV induces protective immunity against
WT H3N8 CIV challenge. To evaluate the immunity generated by the H3N8 LACIV,
mice (n � 6) were vaccinated i.n. with 103 PFU of H3N8 WT or LACIV, mock vaccinated
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), or vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) with 100 �l of
Nobivac, a commercial IIV against H3N8 CIV (Fig. 4). Humoral immune responses were
evaluated in mice sera collected 2 weeks later (Fig. 4A). Total H3N8 CIV antibody
responses were characterized by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using
cell lysates from mock- or H3N8 CIV-infected MDCK cells (41). Mice vaccinated with the
H3N8 LACIV elicited high serum IgG titers against parental H3N8 CIV, whereas the
antibody titers of mice vaccinated with Nobivac were lower than those in the H3N8
LACIV or WT vaccinated mice (Fig. 4A). In addition, hemagglutination inhibition (HAI)
assays were performed to examine the presence of anti-HA neutralizing antibodies on

C (A), 37°

results determined in triplicate. Dotted lines indicate the limit of detection (200 FFU/ml). *, P � 0.05

 sera from vaccinated mice (Fig. 4B), showing that HAI titers against CIV H3N8 were
higher in mice vaccinated with the H3N8 LACIV than those observed in mice vaccinated
with the H3N8 IIV.
To further examine the immunogenicity of LACIV, we evaluated whether the virus
can induce a localized CD8 T cell response (Fig. 5). To this end, mice (n � 4) were
immunized as described above and, at 10 days p.i., lung and spleen samples were
collected and single-cell preparations made for flow cytometric analysis (42). Live CD8
T cells were further gated for a H3N8 CIV-specific population (42, 43). The results
showed that vaccination with H3N8 LACIV induced elevated levels of NP and PA-
specific lung CD8 T cells, similar to those induced by WT virus in both lungs (Fig. 5A)
and the spleen (Fig. 5B). Importantly, animals vaccinated with Nobivac did not show a
T cell response either in the lung (Fig. 5A) or the spleen (Fig. 5B), highlighting important
differences in induced immunity between H3N8 LACIV and the H3N8 IIV.
We next evaluated the ability of H3N8 LACIV to induce protective immunity. Mice
(n � 6) were vaccinated i.n. with 103 PFU of H3N8 WT or LACIV, vaccinated i.m. with 100
�l of the IIV Nobivac, or mock vaccinated with PBS. Two weeks later mice were
challenged with 105 PFU of WT H3N8 CIV and viral titers in the lungs of infected mice
(n � 3/group) were determined 2 and 4 days after challenge (Fig. 6). Mock-vaccinated

 mice showed high viral titers in the lungs at days 2 and 4 p.i., whereas mice immunized
with H3N8 WT CIV and with LACIV showed no detectable virus in the lungs at those
times (Fig. 6). Mice vaccinated with the H3N8 IIV showed high viral titers at day 2 but
no detectable virus at day 4 p.i. (Fig. 6).
H3N8 LACIV is attenuated in canine tracheal explants compared to H3N8 WT
CIV. To compare LACIV and WT H3N8 CIV pathogenicity and replication efficiency at the
site of infection within dogs (Fig. 7), we inoculated dog tracheal explants with each
virus and compared histological lesions (Fig. 7A), viral NP expression (Fig. 7B), changes
in ciliary function (Fig. 7C), and viral replication (Fig. 7D) at different times (days 1, 3,
and 5) p.i. The H3N8 WT CIV induced major histological changes in dog tracheal
explants, with thinning and desquamation of the epithelium, loss of cilia (Fig. 5A), and
significant reduction of ciliary function (Fig. 7C) between days 1 and 5 p.i. Histological
damages induced by H3N8 LACIV were delayed and reduced compared to WT H3N8
CIV, since the epithelium maintained its normal thickness until day 3 p.i. (Fig. 7A), and
the ciliary function (Fig. 7C) was only significantly reduced from day 3 p.i. Viral kinetics
(Fig. 7D) and NP expression (Fig. 7B) were comparable between the two viruses,
although only WT H3N8 CIV was detectable at day 1 p.i. (Fig. 7D). Overall, these results

 indicate that H3N8 LACIV pathogenicity is attenuated in canine tracheal explants
compared to its WT counterpart.
H3N8 LACIV provides limited protection against heterologous H3N2 CIV chal-
lenge. We next evaluated whether H3N8 LACIV could induce protective immunity
against a heterologous H3N2 CIV challenge (Fig. 8). Mice (n � 6) were vaccinated i.n.
with 103 PFU of WT or LACIV H3N8, mock vaccinated with PBS, or vaccinated i.m. with
100 �l of the H3N8 IIV Nobivac or a commercial H3N2 IIV (Zoetis). Antibodies against
H3N2 CIV were evaluated by ELISA using cell lysates from mock- or H3N2 CIV-infected

 (Fig. 8C) proteins of H3N2 CIV were also evaluated. When the cell lysate was used as an
antigen, antibodies against H3N2 CIV were detected in sera of mice vaccinated with WT
H3N8 CIV and, to a lower extent, in mice vaccinated with H3N8 LACIV, although the
levels were lower than those against H3N8 CIV (Fig. 8A). Similarly, using the recombi-
nant proteins (HA or NA) as antigens to perform the ELISA, only antibodies against
H3N2 CIV HA were detected in samples of animals immunized with WT H3N8 CIV (Fig.
8B). However, no antibodies were detected against the NA protein (Fig. 8C). No
detectable IgG antibodies against H3N2 CIV were detected in mice vaccinated with the
H3N8 IIV Nobivac either using the cell extracts (Fig. 8A) or the recombinant proteins
(Fig. 8B and C). The H3N2 CIV IIV induced higher IgG antibodies against H3N2 CIV in all
cases, as expected (Fig. 8A to C).
The lower level of cross-reactive immunity against H3N2 CIV upon vaccination with
the H3N8 LACIV was confirmed after challenge i.n. with H3N2 CIV 2 weeks postvacci-
nation (Fig. 8D). Mock-vaccinated mice showed high H3N2 CIV titers that were undis-
tinguishable from those seen in animals vaccinated with the H3N8 CIV IIV Nobivac. In

 contrast, mice vaccinated with the H3N2 CIV IIV showed reduced or undetectable titers
at days 2 and 4 postchallenge, respectively. Although we observed similar H3N2 CIV
titers at day 2 postchallenge, viral titers at day 4 p.i. in mice vaccinated with the H3N8
LACIV were �100 times lower than those obtained in the mock-vaccinated group.
These results suggest that H3N8 LACIV can induce limited cross-reactive immune
responses and heterologous protection, most probably mediated by a T cell response,
against H3N2 CIV but that the efficacy is lower than that obtained with the H3N2 IIV.
DISCUSSION
We report here a novel LAIV prepared using plasmid-based reverse genetics tech-
niques, which may be used for the prevention of H3N8 CIV. We generated a recombi-
nant H3N8 CIV containing the mutations responsible for the ts phenotype of the human
A/AA/6/60 H2N2 LAIV, resulting in ts H3N8 CIV (LACIV) that was highly attenuated in
vivo and ex vivo compared to its WT counterpart. Our H3N8 LACIV was able to confer,
upon a single i.n. immunization in mice, complete protection against challenge with WT
H3N8 CIV. This demonstrates the feasibility of using the ts H3N8 LACIV as a safe,
immunogenic, and protective vaccine to control H3N8 CIV in dogs. However, the H3N8
LACIV showed limited immunogenicity and protection efficacy against the heterolo-
gous H3N2 CIV, suggesting the need of a different LACIV for the treatment and control
of H3N2 CIV.
The ts, ca, and att A/AA/6/60 H2N2 LAIV has been licensed for human use since
2003, and is used as a master donor virus for the generation of both seasonal or
potentially pandemic human LAIV by creating reassortant viruses containing the six
H2N2-derived internal viral RNA (vRNA) segments (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS) and the
two glycoprotein-encoding vRNAs (HA and NA) from a virus that antigenically matches
the strains predicted to circulate in the upcoming influenza season (seasonal vaccine)
or potentially pandemic strains (pandemic vaccine) (44, 45). Five mutations (PB2 N265S;
PB1 K391E, D581G, and A661T; and NP D34G) are responsible for the ts phenotype of
the A/AA/6/60 H2N2 LAIV, and those mutations also impart a strong ts phenotype and
attenuation to other viral strains, such as PR8 (36, 46) and pH1N1 (37).
Intranasal immunization is a desirable delivery method for providing optimal im-
munity to IAV because it leads to the generation of a mucosal immune responses,
creating an immune barrier at the site of potential infection (47), as well as systemic
humoral responses, cellular immunity (45, 48–51). Similar to infection with WT IAV, LAIV
immunization also leads to recruitment of influenza-specific CD8 T cells to the lungs
(42, 50, 52–54), which provides immunity against heterologous influenza challenge (42,
52). Thus, a LAIV rather than an IIV is desired for the control of IAV infections (22, 23,
27, 55).
Since the emergence of H3N8 CIV in 1999 in the United States and the H3N2 CIV in
Asia (in 2005) and the United States (in 2015), CIVs have been maintained mainly in
animal shelters and kennels as those populations allow ready transmission of the virus
(10, 16, 17, 56, 57). Strains of the H3 subtype of IAV infect a number of mammalian
hosts, including humans, pigs, horses, dogs, cats, and seals, as well as poultry (6, 11,
57–61). Naturally occurring H3N1 virus carrying the HA gene of an avian-like H3N2 CIV
and the other seven segments of the human pH1N1 has been reported in dogs in Korea
(20), suggesting that dogs could act as an intermediate host for genetic reassortment
of IAV, including those that might infect humans. However, no transmission of H3N8 or
H3N2 CIV transmission from dogs to humans has been reported to date. It may be
possible to eradicate both H3N8 and H3N2 CIVs from the dog population through
infection control, as well as by using vaccination approaches. CIV LAIVs represent a
better option for efficient CIV control and probably eradication since they induce better
and faster antiviral immunity.
The H3N8 LACIV generated here was ts and attenuated in mice and induced
protective immune responses against challenge with homologous H3N8 CIV WT, and
the responses were stronger than those obtained with a commercial H3N8 CIV IIV. Its
replication and pathogenesis were also restricted in canine tracheal explants, and we

 are currently evaluating the safety, immunogenicity, and protection efficacy of our
H3N8 LACIV in dogs, the real target population.
To achieve protection in dogs, animals are vaccinated i.m. with 1 ml of the CIV H3N8
IIV (Nobivac) using a two-dose regime (62). The average weight of a male or female
mouse is �20 g, whereas the average weight of a female or male beagle dog is �10
kg. Thus, in principle mice should be vaccinated with 500 times less (just 2 �l) of the
CIV H3N8 IIV than dogs. However, in our experiments, mice were immunized i.m. with
100 �l of the CIV H3N8 IIV, a 50� higher dose than on a weight basis. In addition, to
evaluate the amount of antigen in the CIV H3N8 IIV, we performed an hemagglutina-
tion assay using the commercial CIV H3N8 IIV or our CIV H3N8 LAIV. The assay showed
that mice vaccinated with the CIV H3N8 IIV were inoculated with approximately 106
viral particles/mouse of inactivated virus, 1,000 times more than the dose (i.e., 103) of
the H3N8 CIV LAIV. The LAIV still elicited better antibody responses and protection
compared to the CIV H3N8 IIV.
Segment eight of IAV encodes the NS1 viral protein, which controls the adaptive
immune responses by inhibiting the interferon-antiviral response of the host (63).
Therefore, NS1 is a virulence factor that offers an attractive target for the development
of attenuated viruses as LAIVs. In fact, IAVs harboring a truncated-NS1 have been shown
as promising vaccines candidates (28, 64–71). In a recent work, we have generated
recombinant H3N8 CIVs containing truncated (NS1-126, NS1-99, or NS1-73) or deleted
(ΔNS1) NS1 proteins and tested them as potential LAIVs against CIV H3N8 infections
(28). The recombinant NS1 mutant H3N8 CIVs were attenuated in vivo (mice) and in
vitro (dog tracheal explants) but were able to confer complete protection against
challenge with WT CIV H3N8 (28). Moreover, the immunogenicity and protection
efficacy of our NS1 mutant H3N8 CIVs was also better than that observed with an H3N8
CIV IIV (28). Future research should determine which one of these attenuation strategies
(NS1 mutant or ts H3N8 CIVs) is more efficient for their implementation as a LAIV for the
prevention and control of H3N8 CIV in dogs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and viruses. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (293T; ATCC CRL-11268) and Madin-Darby
canine kidney cells (MDCK; ATCC CCL-34) were grown at 37°
C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco modified Eagle
medium (DMEM; Mediatech, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% PSG
(penicillin, 100 U/ml; streptomycin 100 �g/ml; L-glutamine, 2 mM) (40).
Recombinant wild-type (WT) and live-attenuated (LACIV) H3N8 CIVs were generated using A/canine/
NY/dog23/2009 H3N8 plasmid-based reverse genetics techniques (72) and grown in MDCK cells at 33°
C.
Influenza A/Ca/IL/41915/2015 H3N2 was also grown in MDCK cells at 33°
C. For infections, virus stocks
were diluted in PBS, 0.3% bovine albumin BA, and 1% PS (PBS/BA/PS). After viral infections, cells were
maintained in DMEM with 0.3% BA, 1% PSG, and 1 �g/ml TPCK (tolylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl
ketone)-treated trypsin (Sigma) (38).
Plasmids. To generate H3N8 LACIV, the PB2 and PB1 genes were subcloned in a pUC19 plasmid (New
England BioLabs), and then ts mutations (PB2 N265S and PB1 K391E, D581G, and A661T) were introduced
by site-directed mutagenesis. The presence of introduced mutations was confirmed by sequencing.
Mutated PB2 and PB1 viral segments were subcloned from pUC19 into the ambisense pDZ plasmid for
virus rescue. To test the ability of WT and LACIV H3N8 polymerases to replicate and transcribe at different
temperatures (33, 37, and 39°
C) using a minigenome assay, we engineered a pPolI plasmid containing
the canine RNA polymerase I (Pol-I) promoter and the mouse Pol-I terminator separated by SapI
endonuclease restriction sites (cpPol-I). The canine Pol-I promoter was obtained by PCR from MDCK cells
(73). Then, the Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) reporter gene containing the 3= and the 5= noncoding regions
of the viral NP (v)RNA was cloned into the cpPol-I plasmid to generate the cpPol-I Gluc reporter plasmid.
All plasmids were confirmed by sequencing (ACGT Inc.). Primers for the generation of the different
plasmids are available upon request.
Minigenome assays. MDCK cells (12-well plate format, 5 � 105 cells/well, triplicates) were cotrans-
fected in suspension using Lipofectamine 2000 with 250 ng of each of the H3N8 WT or LACIV ambisense
pDZ PB2, PB1, PA, and NP plasmids, together with 500 ng of the cpPol-I Gluc plasmid. A mammalian
expression pCAGGS plasmid encoding Cypridina luciferase (Cluc; 100 ng) was also included to normalize
transfection efficiencies (74). Cells transfected in the absence of the pDZ NP plasmid were used as
negative control. At 24 h posttransfection, the Gluc and Cluc expression levels were determined using a
luciferase assay kit (New England BioLabs) and quantified with a Lumicount luminometer (Packard). The
fold induction over the level of induction for the negative control (the absence of NP) was determined.
The mean values and standard deviations (SD) were calculated and statistical analysis was performed
using a two-tailed Student t test using Microsoft Excel software.

 Virus rescue. Virus rescues were performed as previously described (40, 75). Briefly, cocultures (1:1)
of 293T/MDCK cells (6-well plate format, 106 cells/well, triplicates) were cotransfected in suspension,
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), with 1 �g of the eight-ambisense H3N8 WT CIV (pDZ-PB2, -PB1,
-PA, -HA, -NP, -NA, -M, and –NS) plasmids. To rescue the H3N8 LACIV, WT PB2 and PB1 pDZ plasmids were
substituted by those containing PB2 and PB1 H3N8 LACIV. At 12 h posttransfection, the transfection
medium was replaced with postinfection (p.i.) medium containing DMEM supplemented with 0.3% BSA,
1% PSG, and 0.5 �g/ml TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma). Tissue culture supernatants (TCS) were collected 3
days posttransfection, clarified, and used to infect fresh monolayers of MDCK cells (6-well plate format,
106 cells/well, triplicates). At 3 days p.i., recombinant viruses were plaque purified and scaled up using
MDCK cells at 33°
C (40). Virus stocks were titrated by standard plaque assay (PFU/ml) in MDCK cells at
33°
C (40).
Virus growth kinetics. Multicycle growth analyses were performed by infecting confluent mono-
layers of MDCK cells (12-well plate format, 5 � 105 cells/well, triplicates) at an MOI of 0.001. Viral titers
in TCS collected at various times p.i. were determined by immunofocus assay (fluorescent forming units
[FFU]/ml) in MDCK cells as previously described (40). Briefly, confluent MDCK cells (96-well plate format,
5 �104 cells/well, triplicates) were infected with 10-fold serial dilutions of H3N8 WT or LACIV. At 12 h p.i.,
the cells were fixed and permeabilized (4% formaldehyde and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 15 min at
room temperature. After being washed with PBS, the cells were incubated in blocking solution (2.5% BSA
in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with 1 �g/ml of an anti-NP monoclonal antibody
(HB-65; ATTC) for 1 h at 37°
C. After a washing step with PBS, the cells were incubated with FITC-
conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibody (Dako) for 1 h at 37°
C. The mean values and SD were
calculated using Microsoft Excel software.
Animal experiments. Adult (5- to 7-week-old) female WT C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the
National Cancer Institute (NCI) and maintained in the animal care facility at the University of Rochester
under specific-pathogen-free conditions. Animal experiments were approved by the University Commit-
tee of Animal Resources and complied with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals of the National Research Council (76). Mice were anesthetized intraperitoneally with
2,2,2-tribromoethanol (Avertin; 240 mg/kg [body weight]) and then inoculated i.n. with 30 �l of the
indicated amounts of H3N8 WT or LACIV or H3N2 WT. Alternatively, 100 �l of a commercially available
inactivated H3N8 CIV vaccine (Nobivac; Merck Animal Health) or inactivated H3N2 CIV vaccine (Zoetis)
were inoculated i.m. Virus replication was determined by measuring viral titers in the lungs of infected
mice at the indicated days p.i. To that end, three mice in each group were euthanized by administration
of a lethal dose of Avertin and exsanguination, and the lungs were collected and homogenized. Virus
titers were determined by immunofocus assay (FFU/ml) as indicated above. Mouse sera were collected
by submandibular bleeding 24 h prior to viral challenges and evaluated for the presence of influenza
virus antibodies by ELISAs and neutralizing antibodies by HAI assays.
Evaluation of T cells response in lung and spleen. Mice (n � 4) were immunized as described
above: 103 PFU of H3N8 WT or LACIV, mock vaccinated with PBS, or vaccinated with 100 �l of
Nobivac (IIV).
Cellular preparations. At 10 days p.i., the lungs and spleens were perfused with PBS, removed, and
separated into right and left lobes. Lung tissue was dissociated in C tubes by the GentleMACS (Miltenyi
Biotek) using the Lung01 program. Samples were incubated in 5 ml (2 �g/ml) of Collagenase II in RPMI
plus 8% FBS at 37°
C for 30 min, with gentle agitation every 10 min. After digestion, samples were further
dissociated using the Heart01 program. Cell suspensions were filtered through 70-�m-pore size filters
prior to 75:40 Percoll (GE Healthcare) discontinuous gradient separation. The top layer, containing fat and
other debris, was removed by aspiration. The cell layer was harvested and washed prior to counting and
staining. Single-cell suspensions were prepared from collected spleens by disruption in RPMI plus 8%
FBS. Counting was achieved through trypan blue exclusion on a hemocytometer.
Flow cytometry. Single cell suspensions were stained in PBS containing 1% FBS, purified CD16/32
(clone 2.4G2), NP and PA tetramers (43), and the following antibodies: TCR�-PerCPCy5.5, CD8�-FITC,
CD4-BV421, CD44-APCCy7, and CD62L-PECy7. Cells were subsequently stained for viability using Live/
Dead Aqua (Invitrogen). All antibodies were obtained from eBioscience, BD Biosciences, or BioLegend. PA
and NP tetramers were obtained from the NIH tetramer core facility (Atlanta, GA). Cells were analyzed by
an LSRII (BD Biosciences) in the University of Rochester Flow Cytometry core facility and analyzed using
FlowJo software (Tree Star).
ELISAs. ELISAs were performed as previously described (40) by coating 96-well plates at 4°
C for 16
h with lysates from mock- or H3N8 or H3N2 WT CIV-infected MDCK cells or with H3N2 CIV HA (250 ng
per well [IRR catalog no. FR-1478]) or NA (250 ng per well [IRR catalog no. FR-1479]). After blocking with
1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature, the plates were incubated with 2-fold serial dilutions (starting
dilution of 1:50) of mouse sera for 1 h at 37°
C. After incubation, the plates were washed with H2O and
incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2,000; Southern Biotech) for
1 h at 37°
C. Reactions were then developed with tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (BioLegend) for
10 min at room temperature, quenched with 2N H2SO4, and read at 450 nm (Vmax kinetic microplate
reader; Molecular Devices).
HAI assays. To evaluate the presence of H3N8 CIV neutralizing antibodies, mous sera were treated
with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE; Denka Seiken) and heat inactivated for 30 min at 56°
C. The sera
were then serially 2-fold diluted (starting dilution of 1:50) in 96-well V-bottom plates and mixed 1:1 with
4 hemagglutinating units (HAU) of WT H3N8 CIV for 30 min at room temperature. The HAI titers were
determined by adding 0.5% turkey red blood cells to the virus-antibody mixtures for 30 min on ice, as

 previously described (40). The geometric mean titers and SD from individual mice (n � 6) were calculated
from the last well where hemagglutination was inhibited.
Canine tracheal explants preparation and virus titrations. Three dog tracheas were harvested
from healthy beagles (Charles River Laboratories) that had been used as negative controls in unrelated
studies. Briefly, tracheas were collected aseptically immediately upon euthanasia and transported in
prewarmed medium as previously described (18). Tracheas were washed five times for a total period of
4 h and maintained at 33°
C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity between washes. The connective tissue was
removed, and the trachea was then open lengthwise. Each tracheal ring was divided in four 0.25-cm2
explants and transferred with the epithelium facing upward onto an agarose plug covered by a sterile
filter. The explants were kept for a total of 6 days at 33°
C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity.
Tracheal explants were infected after a period of 24 h postpreparation (designed as day zero) with
200 PFU of WT or LACIV H3N8 or mock infected with culture medium. Inoculated explants were sampled
for virus quantification, bead clearance assays, and histology at days 0, 1, 3, and 5 p.i. Viral replication was
evaluated by plaque assays on MDCK cells.
Estimation of bead clearance time. The ciliary function of tracheal explants was evaluated as
previously described (18) by placing 5 �l of polystyrene microsphere beads (Polysciences, Northampton,
United Kingdom) on the explant apical surfaces and measuring the time to displace the beads.
Histological analysis and immunohistochemistry. After collection, the explants were fixed in 10%
buffered formalin for a minimum of 48 h before paraffin embedding and sectioning. Subsequently, 4-�m
sections of paraffin embedded tissue were either stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histo-
pathological evaluation or immunostained for the viral NP using standard procedures as previously
described (18). For NP immunostaining, the Dako supervision system was used according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, along with a monoclonal mouse anti-NP (clone HB65; dilution, 1:500). Slides
were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin. Histological images were captured with cellD software
(Olympus).
