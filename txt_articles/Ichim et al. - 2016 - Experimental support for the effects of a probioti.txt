of a probiotic/digestive enzyme supplement 
on serum cholesterol concentrations  
and the intestinal microbiome

Abstract 
Background: Elevated levels of blood cholesterol are associated with cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of mor-
bidity and mortality worldwide. Current therapies for addressing elevated blood cholesterol can be inadequate, inef-
fective or associated with side effects; therefore, the search for additional therapies is ongoing. This study evaluated 
Daily Body Restore (DBR), a proprietary blend of 9 probiotic organisms of the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, 
and 10 digestive enzymes, for its effects on cholesterol metabolism using an in vitro system and a mouse model.
Methods: We used a murine model of hypercholesterolemia induced by a high fat diet to evaluate the effects of 
DBR on blood cholesterol concentrations. Hypercholesterolemic mice were supplemented with DBR in their drinking 
water for 8 weeks and compared to control mice given low fat diets or unsupplemented high fat diets. To evaluate the 
effects of DBR on the activity of gut microbiota in vitro, the Shime® system consisting of sequential colon reactors was 
supplemented with DBR for analysis of short chain fatty acid production.
Results: Analysis of hypercholesterolemic mice after 4 and 8 weeks of DBR supplementation revealed significant 
decreases in blood concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and increases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 
while triglyceride concentrations were unaltered. Specifically, after 4 weeks of DBR supplementation, there was a 
47 % decrease in LDL and a 32 % increase in HDL in peripheral blood compared to unsupplemented, high fat diet-fed 
mice. After 8 weeks of DBR treatment, LDL concentrations were dramatically reduced by 78 % and HDL was increased 
by 52 % relative to control mice. Addition of DBR to the Shime® system led to significantly increased production of 
propionate in colon reactors, indicative of microbial production of short chain fatty acids known to inhibit cholesterol 
synthesis.
Conclusions: DBR, a probiotic and digestive enzyme supplement, lowered harmful LDL and increased HDL levels in 
a mouse model and also exerted in vitro effects consistent with cholesterol-lowering activity. Given the magnitude of 
the effects of DBR, these findings are promising for clinical implementation of DBR for treating hypercholesterolemia.

Background
Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death world-
wide for which several risk factors have been identified, 
a major one being hypercholesterolemia. A central goal 
in cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment is 
reducing the level of serum cholesterol in individuals 
that present with elevated serum levels of low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and/or triglyercides. Both 
pharmacological and non-pharmacological interven-
tions, including drug therapy, dietary interventions, 
and exercise can reduce cholesterol concentrations in 
serum [1]. Many patients prefer non-drug treatments for

treating elevated serum cholesterol owing to side effects 
of anti-lipid drugs, contraindications for use of these 
medications, or personal preferences. However, nondrug 
options involving lifestyle and dietary modifications are 
not always effective; therefore, natural means for address-
ing hyperlipidemia have been investigated experimentally 
and clinically, including nutraceuticals, functional foods 
and other dietary supplements.
Probiotics are living microorganisms which when 
administered in adequate amounts confer upon a health 
benefit upon the host. Pioneering studies in the 1970s 
demonstrated that fermented milk containing a Lacto-
bacillus strain exerted cholesterol-lowering effects in 
humans [2]. Numerous studies have since confirmed that 
some of the lactic acid bacteria, mainly Lactobacillus and 
Bifidobacteria strains, are capable of modulating hyper-
cholesterolemia [3, 4]. In vitro studies and animal models 
have also been used to determine the effects of probiotic 
interventions on metabolic processes and gene expres-
sion related to cholesterol regulation. Studies of the 
mechanisms by which probiotics lower cholesterol levels 
have revealed several affected pathways. It has been dem-
onstrated that lactic acid bacteria ferment food-derived 
indigestible carbohydrates to produce short-chain fatty 
acids in the gut, which can then cause a decrease in the 
systemic levels of blood lipids by inhibiting hepatic cho-
lesterol synthesis and/or by redistributing cholesterol 
from plasma to the liver [5]. Additionally, probiotic bac-
teria are also capable of directly assimilating cholesterol 
and interfering with cholesterol absorption from the gut. 
On this basis, there exists a strong rationale for daily 
consumption of probiotic products as one strategy for 
addressing hypercholesterolemia in patients at-risk or 
afflicted with cardiovascular disease.
Numerous probiotic species and combinations 
thereof have been employed as supplements for treat-
ing hypercholesterolemia as well as for a breadth of 
disorders of metabolism and digestion [6]. Unfortu-
nately, in the field of probiotic research, there has been 
a mixture of both positive effects and contradictory 
results derived from human studies [7–13]. A recent 
meta-analysis demonstrated that long-term (>4 week) 
probiotic interventions can effectively reduce serum 
LDL and triglycerides in a statistically significant man-
ner [14]. While the prospects for using probiotics to 
treat hypercholesterolemia are promising, information 
about which probiotic species or combinations thereof 
are actually effective, dosing regimens, and formulation 
protocols is lacking. The point must be raised that dif-
ferent probiotic preparations are anticipated to have 
variable cholesterol-lowering activities. Indeed, each 
bacterial species is unique, having distinct biological 
effects, and therefore, distinct health-promoting effects 
when used individually or in combination with other 
species [6]. Selection of the appropriate probiotic 
strains for development of supplements and food prod-
ucts must take into account their viability and meta-
bolic activity during the manufacturing process, in the 
specific delivery vehicle, as well as in the gut microen-
vironment [15, 16].
This study evaluated Daily Body Restore (DBR), a 
proprietary blend of 9 probiotic organisms of the gen-
era Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, as well as 10 
digestive enzymes, for its efficacy at modifying blood 
cholesterol levels. We utilized a mouse model of diet-
induced hypercholesterolemia and an in vitro system, 
the Simulator of Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem 
(Shime®), where the influence of DBR on fermentation 
by intestinal microbiota was tested. These studies not 
only demonstrate the cholesterol-lowering ability of 
DBR in vivo, but also confirm that the microbial constit-
uents of DBR exhibit activity that influences the intes-
tinal microbiota in a beneficial manner consistent with 
cholesterol lowering activity. Hence, this work provides 
valuable proof-of-principle support for clinical use of 
this specific combination of probiotics and digestive 
enzymes as a dietary supplement for individuals with 
hypercholesterolemia.
Methods
Daily Body Restore (DBR)
DBR consists of capsules containing a proprietary blends 
of probiotics (116.20 mg total weight); specifically, Bifi-
dobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactoba-
cillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus 
plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium 
longum, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, 
and digestive enzymes (272.65 mg total weight); specifi-
cally, amylase, glucoamylase, lipase, bromelain, maltase, 
lactase, hemicellulose, xylanase, papain, and invertase.
Mice
C57BL/6J mice were bred at the Malaghan Institute for 
Medical Research (Wellington, New Zealand) and experi-
ments were performed at Trinity Bioactives (Wellington, 
New Zealand). All protocols were approved by the Ani-
mal Ethics Committee at the University of Otago, Wel-
lington, New Zealand (Protocol AEC3-12) and animals 
received care in compliance with the guidelines set forth 
by this committee. Mice were randomly assigned to test 
groups consisting of 10 mice/group that were each dis-
tributed into two boxes of five animals each. All mice 
were first placed on a Low Fat AIN 93 M diet for 7 days. 
This diet has a fat content of 4.00 % (w/w) and 15.43 kJ/g

caloric content. Subsequently, a control group of mice 
was continued on the low fat diet for the duration of the 
study. The other two groups of mice (Control and Experi-
mental Groups) were fed a high fat diet beginning at week 
2 through to the end of the study. This high fat diet was 
intended to simulate human diets enriched in fat and 
sugar and contained a fat content of 35.00 % and a calo-
rie content of 22.40 kJ/G, which contained beef tallow and 
hydrogenated vegetable shortening as the lipid compo-
nents. Mice were given the high fat diet for 13 weeks to 
establish hypercholesterolemia. Subsequently, the high fat 
diet-fed group was divided into two cohorts of mice for 
the experimental period. One group was supplemented 
with DBR in (65 μg/mL) in their drinking water while the 
other group was given unsupplemented tap water for the 
subsequent 8 weeks. To summarize, the following groups 
of mice were analyzed at weeks 0, 4 and 8 of the experi-
mental period:
1. Continuation on low fat AIN 93 M Diet (n = 10)
2. High fat diet (n = 10)
3. High fat diet plus Daily Body Restore (DBR) in drink-
ing water
Monitoring and measurements
Animals were monitored daily while body weights were 
monitored once weekly throughout the trial.
Food and water consumption were monitored three 
times weekly. At these times, the food was replenished 
with fresh food and 250 mL of fresh supplemented or 
non-supplemented water was provided. At the time of 
the water change, the residual water in the bottle was 
recorded as the amount of water drunk.
Blood samples were taken by tail tipping at the times 
indicated. Blood samples were collected in tubes and 
stored at 4 °C overnight and the sera were aspirated and 
stored in fresh tubes at −20 °C. At the termination of 
the study, blood was also collected by cardiac puncture. 
Briefly, the mice were fasted for 4 h, and then anesthe-
tized with Ketamine (100 mg/kg body weight) and Xyla-
zine (5 mg/kg) for the cardiac puncture procedure. Sera 
were harvested as described.
Serum analysis
Aliquots of serum taken from mice at time points corre-
sponding to weeks 0, 4 and 8 of DBR supplementation or 
control treatment were analyzed using biochemical assay 
kits for Atotal cholesterol (enzymatic cholesterol assay 
kit; XpressBio, Frederick MD, USA), LDL (colorimetric 
cholesterol assay kit; XpressBio), and triglycerides (enzy-
matic triglycerides assay kit; XpressBio). The concentra-
tion of HDL was calculated as the difference between 
total cholesterol and LDL.
Cholesterol measurements were also performed using 
serum samples taken on weeks 0, 4 and 8 of DBR supple-
mentation or control treatment.
Simulator of human intestinal microbial ecosystem 
(Shime®) study
These experiments were conducted at ProDigest (Gent, 
Belgium). Colon reactors were inoculated with a fecal 
sample from a young adult donor and the experimen-
tal system was conducted as described previously [17]. 
Briefly, the Shime® system consists of a series of double-
jacketed vessels, simulating the digestive compartments. 
After inoculation, a two-week start up period was con-
ducted to allow the microbial community to differenti-
ate in the reactors. Subsequently, the reactors were run 
for a two-week period in which standard Shime® feed 
was dosed to the system. The medium given consisted 
of arabinogalactan (1 g/L), pectin (2 g/L), xylan (1 g/L), 
starch (4.2 g/L), glucose (0.4 g/L), yeast extract (3 g/L), 
peptone (1 g/L), mucin (4 g/L), cysteine (0.5 g/L). This 
2-week feeding with medium established the baseline 
microbial community composition and activity in the dif-
ferent reactors and was considered the control period. 
Subsequently, in the treatment period the Shime® reac-
tor was operated under nominal conditions but including 
supplementation with DBR for 3 weeks. Supplementa-
tion was conducted using a sinker was used to accom-
modate 1 capsule of DBR in the stomach/small intestine 
compartment.
Metabolic parameters were evaluated and compared 
in the Shime® vessels during the 2 week control period 
and the three-week treatment period of supplementation 
with DRB. The production of short-chain fatty acids (i.e. 
propionate) was evaluated by standard gas-chromato-
graphic methods from samples collected from the reac-
tors weekly. Lactate production was measured in the 
reactors to evaluate microbial metabolic activity [18]. The 
composition of microbial communities, lactobacilli and 
bifidobacteria, were measured in each reactor by quanti-
tative RT-PCR once weekly in the control and treatment 
periods.
Statistical analysis
For assessing the statistical significance between groups, 
the following tests were performed: (1) Means and stand-
ard errors of means; (2) Assessment of statistical signifi-
cance using independent Students t test for comparison 
of mean values between two populations where p < 0.05 
is considered significant; and, (3) Assessment of outlier 
removal using Cook’s distances and z scores. Statistical 
analyses were conducted with and without outliers. All 
data are displayed as the absolute changes and averages 
percentages ± SEM for the indicated parameters.

Results
DBR significantly reduces LDL and increases HDL in a 
mouse model of hypercholesterolemia
Feeding a high fat diet to mice can be used to model 
obesity syndromes, insulin resistance, and atherosclero-
sis [19]. To evaluate the influence of DBR on cholesterol 
metabolism in vivo, mice were fed a high calorie, high fat 
diet and were subsequently supplemented with DBR in 
their drinking water to evaluate its impact on the delete-
rious diet. The high fat diet was provided to two groups 
of mice for a total of 13 weeks to establish the obesity 
syndrome and high cholesterol. Subsequently, the high 
fat diet was continued along with DBR treatment for 
8 weeks in one group of mice and the high fat diet alone 
(unsupplemented) in the control cohort. The third group 
of mice was given a low fat diet for the duration of the 
study and used as a comparison for changes in metabolic 
parameters.
Monitoring of body weights over the course of the 
study revealed that, as anticipated, mice fed a high-fat 
diet gained weight at a faster rate than those receiving 
the standard diet. However, there was no significant dif-
ference in mean percentage of body weight gain between 
DBR supplement and unsupplemented mice fed a high 
fat diet. Specifically, the mean percentage of body weight 
gain during the experimental period was 4.91 ± 1.26, 
15.88 1.55, 14.56 ± 1.26 % in the low fat, high fat, and 
high fat/DBR supplemented diet groups, respectively. 
Additionally, food and water consumption were not sig-
nificantly different between DBR-supplemented mice and 
control mice given high fat and low fat diets. Mean group 
food consumption measurements were 492.44 ± 31.29, 
579.71 ± 75.46, and 614.21 ± 50.41 g/mouse for the low 
fat, high fat, and high fat/DBR supplemented diet groups, 
respectively. Water consumption measurements were 
158.51 ± 32.02 and 177.05 ± 19.04 mL/mouse in the 
unsupplemented and DBR-supplemented mice fed a high 
fat diet, respectively.
Analysis of serum cholesterol levels was performed 
after 4 and 8 weeks of DBR supplementation using blood 
samples obtained from tail tips or by cardiac puncture. 
The data summarizing blood cholesterol concentrations 
between the treatment groups are summarized in Fig. 1a. 
As expected, LDL, the fraction of serum cholesterol asso-
ciated with atherogenesis and cardiovascular risk, was 
increased by a high fat diet as compared to the low fat 
diet. Specifically, prior to DBR supplementation (week 
0), the LDL values in peripheral blood were 23.64 ± 6.01, 
41.75 ± 5.84, and 31.56 ± 5.85 mg/dl in the low fat 
and the two high fat diet-fed groups (corresponding to 
unsupplement control and DBR-treated), respectively 
(p = 0.045 low fat vs. control high fat diet groups). The 
high fat diet groups therefore had LDL values that were 
76.6 and 33.5 % higher than those of low fat diet-fed con-
trol mice, indicating that this dietary regimen was very 
effective at inducing hypercholesterolemia.
After 4 weeks of supplementation with DBR, the 
results revealed that this probiotic formulation had a sig-
nificant impact on LDL cholesterol (Fig. 1a). In the high 
fat diet group that was not supplemented with DBR, 
LDL concentrations in peripheral blood did not signifi-
cantly change between weeks 0 and 4: the values were 
41.75 ± 5.84 and 39.85 ± 4.64 at these time points. How-
ever, in the DBR-treated group, LDL concentrations had 
dropped significantly after 4 weeks of treatment. In com-
parison to week 0 where high fat diet/DBR-treated mice 
had mean serum LDL levels of 31.56 ± 5.85 mg/dL, these 
levels were reduced to 20.88 ± 3.12 mg/dl after 4 weeks, 
amounting to a 33.8 % decrease in harmful cholesterol 
levels. When compared to unsupplemented mice on the 
high fat diet, the animals treated with DBR had LDL con-
centrations that were approximately half at week four 
0.003 (39.85 ± 4.64 and 20.88 ± 3.12 mg/dL, respectively; 
p = 0.003).
Evaluation of LDL in peripheral blood after another 
4 weeks of supplementation or control treatment (week 
8 of the study) revealed further reductions in harmful 
cholesterol mediated by treatment with DBR (Fig. 1a). 
In mice that received the fatty diet but were not supple-
mented with DBR, LDL increased from 39.85 ± 4.64 to 
43.60 ± 5.38 between weeks 4 and 8 of the study, indica-
tive of the ongoing deleterious effects of the fatty diet. 
However, in DBR-treated mice given this same diet, a 
70.3 % decrease in LDL could be appreciated by week 
8 relative to the beginning of the study (9.37 ± 3.12 vs. 
31.56 ± 5.85). Comparisons of DBR-treated mice and 
unsupplemented mice at week 8 of the study revealed a 
78.5 % reduction of LDL in mice that received the pro-
biotic supplement (9.37 ± 3.12 vs. 43.60 ± 5.38 mg/dL; 
p = 0.00003).
In addition to peripheral blood, LDL in serum obtained 
by cardiac puncture was also analyzed after eight weeks 
of DBR or control treatment (Fig. 1a). Mice fed the fatty 
diet but not treated with the probiotic had a 117 % higher 
concentration of serum LDL in systemic blood as com-
pared to control mice (15.27 ± 3.25 and 33.14 ± 6.35, 
respectively; p = 0.03). However, LDL was very low in 
mice that had been treated with DBR; 7.36 mg/dL or 78 % 
lower than in control mice given the high fat diet without 
DBR (p = 0.001). In both peripheral blood and systemic 
blood derived from cardiac puncture, LDL levels in DBR-
treated mice after 8 weeks were even lower than those in 
mice receiving the low fat diet (p = 0.006 and p = 0.06, 
respectively). Collectively, these results demonstrate that 
DBR affords significant and progressive reduction of 
harmful LDL levels in the circulation.

Assessment of HDL, which is generally correlated with 
cardiovascular health, was measured as the difference 
between total cholesterol concentrations and LDL con-
centrations in serum for each time point (Fig. 1b). No sta-
tistically significant difference between the three groups 
could be appreciated between low and high fat diet 
groups before DBR supplementation commenced. After 
4 weeks of DBR supplementation, there was an increase 
in HDL in serum as compared to unsupplemented, high 
fat diet-fed mice although the results were not statisti-
cally significant (77.31 ± 11.65 and 58.59 ± 4.44, respec-
tively; p = 0.14). However, after 8 weeks, comparison 
of DBR-treated and untreated yielded statistically sig-
nificant increases in HDL in the former group. The HDL 
concentrations were 99.59 ± 9.77 and 65.45 ± 5.36, in 
probiotic supplemented and control groups, respec-
tively (p = 0.007). In DBR-treated mice, this represented 
a 72.4 % increase in HDL over the course of the 8-week 
supplementation period (57.78 ± 6.50 vs. 99.59 ± 9.77). 
Moreover, the HDL levels in serum of DBR-treated mice 
were dramatically increased (127 %) relative to those in 
control mice given the low fat diet for the duration of the 
study (99.57 ± 9.77 vs. 43.93 ± 3.73). In systemic blood 
obtained by cardiac puncture, HDL was also signifi-
cantly increased by DBR treatment (Fig. 1b). Mice given 
the probiotic had HDL cholesterol concentrations that 
were 29.1 % higher than those given the fatty diet alone 
(82.98 ± 8.55 and 64.27 ± 5.46, p = 0.07).
We also investigated the influence of DBR on triglycer-
ides, which serve as biomarkers of cardiovascular risk, in 
mice fed a high fat diet (Fig. 1c). The data showed that the 
high fat diet did not significantly alter triglyceride levels 
in this mouse model as compared to mice fed a low fat 
diet. After 4 and 8 weeks of DBR supplementation, there 
were no significant differences in triglyceride concentra-
tions relative to the unsupplemented control group.
Lastly, total serum cholesterol was compared between 
the three cohorts of mice at weeks 0, 4 and 8 of DBR or 
control treatment (Fig. 1d). Expectedly, mice fed the low 
fat diet had significantly lower serum cholesterol levels as 
compared to those given the high fat diet. However, com-
parison of DBR-treated vs. unsupplemented mice on the 
high fat diet did not reveal significant differences in total 
cholesterol in either peripheral or systemic blood.

of mice were evaluated for cholesterol concentrations in serum obtained from peripheral blood (PB) or by cardiac puncture. The groups were as 
follows: (1) Control mice maintained on a low fat diet; (2) Control mice maintained on a high fat diet; and, (3) Experimental mice maintained on a 
high fat diet and supplemented with DBR in their drinking water. Analyses of LDL (a), HDL (b), triglycerides (c), and total cholesterol (d) were per-
formed using serum taken at week 0, 4 and 8 of DBR or control treatments. * High fat diet vs. high fat diet + DBR is statistically significant difference

Collectively, these data from the mouse model of 
hypercholesterolmemia demonstrate that treatment with 
the DBR supplement containing a proprietary blend of 
probiotics and digestive enzymes specifically reduces 
harmful LDL in serum while increasing HDL.
DBR supplementation increases metabolic activity 
of microbiota in the shime® system
In this study, we first evaluated the impact of DBR on fer-
mentation metabolites in the Shime® model where the 
interactions of this supplement with native microbiota 
corresponding to conditions mimicking the ascending, 
transverse and descending colon were tested. The con-
centrations of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) produced 
in the Shime® reactors were measured. SCFA are pro-
duced in the gut from fermentation of indigestible car-
bohydrates including dietary fiber, resistant starch, and 
oligosaccharides, and are absorbed from the colon into 
the liver as well as peripheral tissues. Production of SCFA 
is beneficial to numerous aspects of the digestive process 
including stimulation of the immune system [20] and 
protection of the colon against cancer [21, 22]. Propion-
ate in particular has been noted to decrease cholesterol 
synthesis in the liver, improving lipid metabolism [23]. 
Since some strains of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus 
have been associated with improved cholesterol profiles 
and overall gut health [24–30], we tested the influence of 
DBR on simulated small intestine conditions.
Our results showed that addition of DBR significantly 
improved propionate production in the vessels corre-
sponding to the ascending colon and transverse colon 
during the 3 week supplementation period based on the 
comparison to the control (non-supplemented) two-
week time period (Fig. 2a). Accordingly, an increased 
production of the metabolite lactate, a by-product of 
the fermentation process, could be appreciated in the 
ascending and transverse colon reactors (Fig. 2b). Moreo-
ver, the presence of lactobacilli was also increased in all 
the Shime® reactor vessels (Fig. 2c), although no change 
in the Bifidobacteria population could be appreciated 
in the DBR-supplemented system vs. the non-supple-
mented control vessels (Fig. 2d). Together, these results 
are suggestive of survival and/or activity of probiotic 
bacteria from DBR under conditions set up to mimic the 
human gastrointestinal tract. The improved propionate 
production in DBR-supplemented vessels corresponding 
to the proximal colon is also suggestive of the potential of 
DBR as a modulator of de novo fatty acid and cholesterol 
synthesis.
Discussion
In this study, Daily Body Restore (DBR), a proprietary 
blend of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria, and digestive 
enzymes, was evaluated in vitro and in an animal model 
to gauge its candidacy as a clinical cholesterol-lower-
ing product. The data generated using these two model

systems support the conclusion that the probiotic strains 
in DBR are metabolically active and can modulate cho-
lesterol metabolism in a favorable manner. In a mouse 
model intended to simulate high fat, high sugar diets, 
DBR treatment afforded significant reductions in harmful 
LDL and improvements in HDL, even improving choles-
terol profiles relative to those of control mice fed normal 
low fat diets. What is more, in the Shime® model that 
simulates the compartments of the gastrointestinal tract, 
addition of DBR to the vessels had a positive impact on 
the activity of intestinal microbiota. Microbial fermen-
tation was increased by DBR, as evident by increased 
lactate acid production in the reactors and an increase 
in lactobacilli. Our results did not show a change in the 
total load of Bifidobacteria in the DBR-treated vs. con-
trol reactors; however, this finding does not rule out the 
possibility that the composition of Bifidobacteria species 
and/or their metabolic activities, including lipid-lowering 
effects, may have been modulated by DBR treatment. 
In addition to probiotics, DBR also contains digestive 
enzymes that likely contribute to increased nutrient 
absorption in vivo, and may also improve cholesterol 
management; specifically, lipase, a central enzyme in 
lipid metabolism.
Moreover, evaluation of short chain fatty acid produc-
tion in the Shime® reactors revealed that propionate 
production was increased in the ascending colon and 
transverse colon vessels during treatment with DBR. This 
fermentation by-product of carbohydrate digestion is 
established as having cholesterol-lowering activity [23]. 
Hence, the Shime® model demonstrated the stability and 
activity of DBR in a dynamic ecosystem. Clinical studies 
are underway to investigate the impact of DBR in indi-
viduals afflicted with hypercholesterolemia and/or having 
cardiovascular risk factors.
In recent years, much attention has been given to the 
ability of probiotics to reduce lipids and cholesterol levels 
with evidence supporting several mechanisms of action. 
Specific bacteria, including specific Lactobacillus strains 
[31], have been reported to assimilate cholesterol in vitro, 
thereby presumably lowering luminal cholesterol levels 
available for absorption in vivo [32–34]. Moreover, Lacto-
bacillus bacteria can produce ferulic acid (FA), which can 
inhibit hepatic HMG-CoA reductase [35, 36], a target of 
statin drugs. Another proposed mechanism of action of 
lactobacilli and bifidobacteria for lowering serum cho-
lesterol is deconjugation of bile acids and increasing 
their rate of excretion, which may increase the demand 
for de novo bile acid synthesis from cholesterol [30, 37]. 
Notably, lactobacilli exhibit strain-specific differences 
in enzymatic activity of bile-salt hydrolase and there-
fore have disparate propensities to remove cholesterol 
from culture medium and to lower serum LDL-C and 
triglycerides in animals [37]. It is important to note that 
not all lactic acid bacteria, combinations of strains, or 
specific formulations can be expected to enact a particu-
lar cholesterol-lowering mechanism [6]. For this reason, 
individual formulations should undergo testing to look 
for metabolic activity and stability of the probiotic, as has 
been performed in the present study for our proprietary 
formulation.
Animal studies have routinely been employed to 
investigate the effects of prescription drugs and herbal 
remedies/natural products as cholesterol modifiers. 
For example, in a mouse model of atherosclerosis, res-
veratrol (a natural phenol and phytoalexin) decreased 
plasma levels of LDL by 19 %, comparable to atorvasta-
tin (Lipitor®) alone (19 %), and the combination of both 
agents decreased LDL by 22 % over the 14-week study 
period [38]. In another example of an experimental study, 
LDL levels were reduced from 53 % to 67 % by ezetimibe 
(a cholesterol absorption inhibitor) treatment in a mouse 
model [39]. Direct comparisons of the present results to 
other animal studies are precluded by the vast variabil-
ity in experimental parameters between studies, includ-
ing the specific animal model, the duration of treatment, 
and the time points of cholesterol measurement. How-
ever, when placed broadly into the context of existing 
experimental data in conjunction with our data from 
the Shime® study, we conclude that DBR appears to be 
remarkably potent and is therefore a promising candidate 
for clinical studies.
Our observations that DBR increases the concentra-
tions of propionate in the vessels corresponding to the 
ascending and transverse colon in the Shime® system 
are suggestive of a potent effect of this probiotic supple-
ment on cholesterol metabolism. Of the short chain fatty 
acids that are typically monitored in the Shime® studies 
(which also include acetate and butyrate), propionate is 
specifically associated with beneficial effects on both 
lipid and glucose metabolism [40, 41]. Short-chain fatty 
acids such as propionate are produced by fermentation 
by intestinal microbes and are readily absorbed from the 
large bowel into the liver in vivo where cholesterol syn-
thesis can be inhibited [5]. The concentrations of propi-
onate, which are influenced by the fermentation substrate 
and the microbial composition, can serve as markers for 
the effects of DBR on cholesterol. High propionate levels 
reportedly lead to a competitive inhibition of the activity 
of acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase involved in cholesterol 
synthesis [42, 43]. Studies where oral propionate was 
administered to animals fed hypercholesterolemic diets 
high in saturated fat revealed lowering of liver cholesterol 
levels [23, 44]. Decreased total concentrations of choles-
terol in plasma have also been reported in animals [45, 
46] as well as increased beneficial HDL in humans [47]

given propionate orally. Interestingly, one study revealed 
that rectal administration of propionate to animals had a 
much more potent cholesterol-lowering effect compared 
with dietary supplementation, suggesting that propionate 
in the colon is a highly potent modulator of cholesterol 
metabolism [23]. Therefore, probiotics such as DBR that 
possess the ability to increase propionate production are 
expected to be associated with lowering of serum choles-
terol and possibly reducing cardiovascular disease risk.
Conclusions
This report provide proof-of-concept for the cholesterol-
lowering effects of DBR, a blend of 9 probiotic organisms 
of the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, and 10 
digestive enzymes, thereby providing a promising basis 
for future clinical studies. Specifically, the probiotic con-
stitution supplied by DBR capsules is demonstrated to 
be active in a simulated intestinal microenvironment, 
and can lower harmful LDL while raising HDL levels in 
experimental animals.
