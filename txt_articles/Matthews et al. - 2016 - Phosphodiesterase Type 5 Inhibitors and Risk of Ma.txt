Abstract
Background
Laboratory evidence suggests that reduced phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) expression
increases the invasiveness of melanoma cells; hence, pharmacological inhibition of PDE5
could affect melanoma risk. Two major epidemiological studies have investigated this and
come to differing conclusions. We therefore aimed to investigate whether PDE5 inhibitor
use is associated with an increased risk of malignant melanoma, and whether any increase
in risk is likely to represent a causal relationship.
Methods and Findings
We conducted a matched cohort study using primary care data from the UK Clinical Prac-
tice Research Datalink. All men initiating a PDE5 inhibitor and with no prior cancer diagno-
sis were identified and matched on age, diabetes status, and general practice to up to four
unexposed controls. Ever use of a PDE5 inhibitor and time-updated cumulative number of
PDE5 inhibitor prescriptions were investigated as exposures, and the primary outcome was
malignant melanoma. Basal cell carcinoma, solar keratosis, and colorectal cancer were
investigated as negative control outcomes to exclude bias. Hazard ratios (HRs) were esti-
mated from Cox models stratified by matched set and adjusted for potential confounders.
145,104 men with �1 PDE5 inhibitor prescription, and 560,933 unexposed matched con-
trols were included. In total, 1,315 incident malignant melanoma diagnoses were observed
during 3.44 million person-years of follow-up (mean 4.9 y per person). After adjusting for
potential confounders, there was weak evidence of a small positive association between
PDE5 inhibitor use and melanoma risk (HR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.01–1.29, p = 0.04). A similar
increase in risk was seen for the two negative control outcomes related to sun exposure
(HR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.11–1.19, p < 0.001, for basal cell carcinoma; HR = 1.21, 95% CI
1.17–1.25, p < 0.001, for solar keratosis), but there was no increased risk for colorectal

 cancer (HR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.85–0.98, p = 0.01). There was no evidence that risk increased
with number of prescriptions received (p-trend = 0.83). In a post hoc analysis, there was
strong evidence that solar keratosis was associated with future PDE5 inhibitor use (odds
ratio = 1.28, 95% CI 1.23–1.34, p < 0.001), suggesting that men with higher sun exposure
were more likely to become PDE5 inhibitor users. However, a limitation of our study was
that we did not have individual-level data on sun exposure, so we could not directly control
for this in the primary analysis.
Conclusions
Our results were not consistent with PDE5 inhibitors being causally associated with mela-
noma risk, and strongly suggest that observed risk increases are driven by greater sun
exposure among patients exposed to a PDE5 inhibitor.
Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• An earlier study using US data suggested that users of PDE5 inhibitors, which are drugs
widely used for erectile dysfunction, may be at nearly double the risk of developing a
type of skin cancer, malignant melanoma; however a subsequent study in Sweden failed
to replicate this finding, resulting in considerable uncertainty over the relationship.
• The present study was done to clarify whether PDE5 inhibitors may affect the risk of
malignant melanoma.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• Using a large UK-based primary care database, we identified 145,104 men who were pre-
scribed a PDE5 inhibitor and 560,933 matched controls with similar characteristics but
no exposure to PDE5 inhibitors; we then compared the subsequent risk of malignant
melanoma in these two groups, adjusting for other potentially important factors.
• We observed a small association between the use of PDE5 inhibitors and malignant mel-
anoma (hazard ratio = 1.14, 95% CI 1.01–1.29, p = 0.04), but we found evidence of a sim-
ilar association between the use of PDE5 inhibitors and both basal cell carcinoma and
solar keratosis, which are both related to sun exposure and were not hypothesised to be
associated with PDE5 inhibitor use.
• We also found strong evidence to suggest that men with a history of solar keratosis, a
marker of high sun exposure, were more likely to become PDE5 inhibitor users.
What Do These Findings Mean?
• Our findings were not consistent with PDE5 inhibitors causing a substantial increase in
the risk of malignant melanoma.

 • It is likely that the small observed increase in the risk of malignant melanoma among
PDE5 inhibitor users is explained by higher sun exposure among PDE5 inhibitor users;
this is strongly suggested by the increased risk of other diseases related to sun exposure
among PDE5 inhibitor users and by the strong association between solar keratosis and
subsequent PDE5 inhibitor use, which implies that men with high sun exposure were
more likely to become PDE5 inhibitor users.
Introduction
The phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil are princi-
pally used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) [1]. Laboratory evidence suggests that
reduced PDE5 expression triggered by BRAF activation increases the invasiveness and meta-
static potential of melanoma cells [2]; hence, pharmacological inhibition of PDE5 might have
an unintended effect on melanoma risk. In addition, PDE5 inhibitors appear to promote mela-
nin synthesis [3], which in turn can significantly facilitate the development of melanoma [4].
These laboratory observations led to two major epidemiological studies of the effect of PDE5
inhibitor use on melanoma risk, but these came to different conclusions: Li et al. initially
reported a near doubling of the hazard of melanoma among sildenafil users within a US-based
cohort of health professionals, using self-reported exposure and outcome data (HR = 1.84, 95%
CI 1.04–3.22) [5]. However, a subsequent study using Swedish registry data did not support
such a large effect size and, despite some overlap in the confidence intervals, suggested a much
more modest association between PDE5 inhibitors and melanoma (HR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.08–
1.36); the authors expressed doubts over whether even this smaller observed association was
causal, as it did not meet several of Hill’s causality criteria [6].
Any increase in malignant melanoma risk caused by PDE5 inhibitor use would have serious
public health implications: 5%–20% of men are affected by ED, and PDE5 inhibitors are an
effective treatment [7,8]. Furthermore, patents for sildenafil and other drugs have expired or
are soon to expire in various countries, leading to the availability of less costly generic versions
and the potential for considerably inflated demand in the near future.
Given the importance of the question, and continuing uncertainty over a causal link, we
aimed to examine the association between PDE5 inhibitors used for ED and the risk of incident
melanoma in a large cohort of men using data from UK primary care, and to assess the causal-
ity of any observed increase in risk.
Methods
Study Design and Data Source
We carried out a matched cohort study using prospectively collected data from the UK Clinical
Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), a database containing anonymised primary care data from
general practitioners (GPs) who use the Vision IT system and have agreed at the practice level
to participate [9]. The UK has a publicly funded healthcare system that is financed through
general taxation and is free at the point of use to UK residents; GPs play a key role as they are
responsible for primary healthcare and specialist referrals. Patients are affiliated to a practice,
which centralises the medical information from their GP as well as information reported back
from specialist referrals and admissions to hospital. CPRD covers 9% of the UK population
and is broadly representative of the wider population [10]. The database includes diagnoses,

 prescriptions and tests from primary care, referrals to specialists, and diagnoses and outcomes
from secondary care, which are fed back to GPs. Lifestyle and anthropometric measurements
are also recorded, and linked deprivation data based on residential area are available for a sub-
set of patients.
Study Population
We used prescription data from CPRD to identify all male patients over the age of 18 y with
incident exposure to a PDE5 inhibitor from 1 July 1999 to 1 August 2014 inclusive. This study
end date was chosen because the regulations for prescribing sildenafil within the National
Health Service (England) were substantially changed on 1 August 2014 [11].
PDE5 inhibitor exposure was considered incident if there were at least 12 mo of follow-up
within CPRD prior to the first prescription record. Follow-up began at the date of first PDE5
inhibitor prescription (hereafter the “index date”). Exposed patients were matched to up to
four unexposed male controls with at least 12 mo of follow-up in CPRD prior to the index date
of the exposed patient. Exposed and control patients were matched on age (within 3 y in either
direction), general practice, and diabetes status, and were required to be registered and under
follow-up in CPRD at the index date. Diabetes status was included as a matching factor because
in preliminary analysis it was a common comorbidity among those receiving a PDE5 inhibitor,
which is likely partly because ED is a common complication of diabetes and partly because UK
prescribing guidelines specifically recommend that men with diabetes should be eligible to
receive a PDE5 inhibitor if needed. Furthermore, diabetes and its treatment have been postu-
lated as having links to risks of a number of cancers including malignant melanoma [12,13].
All matching variables were measured at the index date. The index date for control patients
was set to be the same as that of their exposed matches. We excluded patients with any cancer
diagnoses prior to their index date and patients with no GP consultations in the year preceding
their index date, since such patients may not be actively receiving care from their officially reg-
istered GP. Individuals selected as controls could later go on to start a PDE5 inhibitor; in this
situation they were censored as a control at the time of starting a PDE5 inhibitor and contrib-
uted separately as an exposed patient from that time point forward (with their own matched
controls).
Exposure and Outcome
Our primary exposure was ever use of a PDE5 inhibitor, based on prescription codes (code list
in S1 Text). In secondary analyses, we also investigated the effect of the time-updated cumula-
tive number of PDE5 inhibitor prescriptions (1, 2–4, 5–9, 10–19, 20+) and time-updated years
since first prescription (�0.5, >0.5–1, >1–2, >2–4, >4 y). In a further secondary analysis, dif-
ferences by specific PDE5 inhibitor drug (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) were investigated by
fitting a model with a multi-category exposure variable capturing specific drug (based on the
drug used in the first prescription), and comparing this to the original model (with a binary
exposure variable capturing any PDE5 inhibitor use) using the likelihood ratio test.
The primary outcome was incident malignant melanoma. Clinical diagnoses are identified
in UK primary care data by National Health Service Read codes in patients’ clinical records.
We used Read codes mapping to ICD-10 code C43 (malignant melanoma of skin; code list in
S2 Text), as identified for previous work [14]. The final code list was checked by a consultant
dermatologist (S. M. L.). To further assess causality, we looked at three control outcomes not
expected to be associated with PDE5 inhibitor exposure: basal cell carcinoma and solar kerato-
sis (both associated with sun exposure) and colorectal cancer.

 Statistical Analysis
Observation time began at the index date and ended at the earliest of the following: incident
melanoma, diagnosis of a cancer other than melanoma, death, transfer out of CPRD, prescrip-
tion of a PDE5 inhibitor (for unexposed controls), or the end of the study period. Prior to
exploring the relationship between PDE5 inhibitors and melanoma, the distributions of base-
line characteristics of exposed and unexposed patients were described.
The association between the primary exposure variable and incident melanoma was then
estimated using a Cox regression model with an underlying age timescale, stratified by matched
set to account for the matching on age, diabetes status, and GP practice [15]. We then adjusted
further for smoking status (current smoker, ex-smoker, never smoker), alcohol use (current
drinker, ex-drinker, non-drinker), body mass index (BMI) (<25, 25–29, 30–34, �35 kg/m2),
and number of GP consultations in the year before the index date (as a proxy for the amount of
contact with health professionals and therefore opportunity for diagnosis, categorised as 1,
2–4, 5–10, �11 consultations). To account for any correlation due to unexposed controls
appearing in the cohort more than once because they later became exposed, we used robust
standard errors to adjust for clustering by the unique patient identifier variable. People with
missing data for the BMI, smoking status, or alcohol use variables (13% overall) were excluded
(complete case analysis), which is valid in a regression context if missingness is conditionally
independent of the outcome [16]; in this context, this means we assumed that there was no
association between having complete data on BMI, smoking status, and alcohol use and devel-
oping malignant melanoma, after accounting for measured covariates. Whilst this is an untest-
able assumption, we believe this to be more plausible in this case than the “missing at random”
assumption required for multiple imputation, since recording of lifestyle-related variables may
depend directly on the variable values (e.g., people with healthy BMI may be less likely to have
their BMI recorded) [17]. In a secondary analysis, we further adjusted for index of multiple
deprivation (IMD) (categorised in quintiles) among the subset of patients with this information
available; IMD is a measure of socioeconomic status based on residential area that combines
small-area deprivation data on income, employment, education, health and disability, crime,
barriers to housing and services, and living environments into an overall score [18]; a higher
score/quintile indicates a higher level of deprivation. To explore possible effect modification,
interaction terms were fitted to generate results stratified by region within the UK (grouped by
latitude into North, Midlands, and South), IMD quintile, smoking status, and current (time-
updated) age group (<50, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79, �80 y). The main analysis was repeated for the
negative control outcomes of basal cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and solar keratosis.
Sensitivity analyses. The first 12 mo of follow-up after the index date were excluded in
both exposed and unexposed patients as a sensitivity analysis, to decrease the chance of reverse
causality (undiagnosed melanomas leading to ED and thus PDE5 inhibitor exposure, or “pro-
topathic bias” [19]). We also repeated the analysis restricted to patients with diabetes because
previous UK prescribing guidelines stated that all patients in this group with ED were eligible
for a PDE5 inhibitor prescription [20].
Post hoc analysis to assess residual confounding by sun exposure. Since our main analy-
ses suggested an increased risk of all sun-exposure-related outcomes among PDE5 inhibitor
users, and we had insufficient information in the dataset to directly control for confounding by
sun exposure, we carried out a post hoc analysis aimed at assessing whether there may be
potential for residual confounding due to sun exposure. We treated the matched exposed and
unexposed groups as a nested case-control dataset in which the outcome was PDE5 inhibitor
use. We then used conditional logistic regression to estimate the association between prior
solar keratosis (a known marker of high sun exposure) and starting a PDE5 inhibitor.

Observational studies using CPRD primary care data have ethical clearance subject to the

Results
A total of 174,430 men aged �18 y with an incident PDE5 inhibitor prescription in the study
period were identified, and 148,207 were eligible for inclusion (S1 Fig). The majority of exclu-
sions were due to individuals having had cancer before their first PDE5 inhibitor prescription
(n = 16,714) or having no GP consultations in the year before exposure (n = 9,462). Of these
148,207 exposed patients, 145,104 (98%) had eligible matches and were included, and 135,589
patients were matched to the maximum four controls. A total of 5.8% of the unexposed con-
trols (n = 40,633) were censored as controls during follow-up and included in the exposed
group, due to being prescribed a PDE5 inhibitor. The characteristics of the exposed and
matched unexposed patients are shown in Table 1. A slightly larger proportion of exposed
patients were overweight, current smokers or ex-smokers, and current alcohol drinkers, com-
pared with unexposed controls.
During 3.44 million person-years of follow-up (mean 4.9 y/person), the crude incidence
rate of melanoma was higher in PDE5 inhibitor users than in unexposed individuals (43.7 ver-
sus 36.8 per 100,000 person-years; Table 2). The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR), accounting for
matched variables and restricted to patients with no missing data on BMI, smoking status, and
alcohol use, showed weak evidence of an increased risk of melanoma in exposed patients in
comparison to unexposed patients (HR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.03–1.31). There was little change in
the estimate when adjusting for all potential confounders (adjusted HR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.01–
1.29, p = 0.04). When further adjusted for IMD quintile in the subset of 445,302 patients (63%)
with this information available, the observed association was smaller but the confidence inter-
val was wider, as expected (HR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.96–1.29, p = 0.17).
Analysis of Negative Control Outcomes
For the two negative control outcomes related to sun exposure, basal cell carcinoma and solar
keratosis, we estimated similar HRs to those observed in the main malignant melanoma analy-
sis (adjusted HR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.11–1.19, p < 0.001, and HR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.17–1.25, p <
0.001, respectively; Table 2), but there was no evidence of any increased risk of colorectal can-
cer among PDE5 inhibitor users (HR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.85–0.98, p = 0.01).
Effect of Cumulative Exposure and Effect Modification by Individual-
Level Factors
There was no evidence that the association between PDE5 inhibitor use and melanoma risk
increased with either cumulative number of PDE5 inhibitor prescriptions received or number
of years since first prescription (Fig 1; p-trend = 0.83 and p = 0.54, respectively). Stratified anal-
yses are presented in Fig 2; point estimates for the association between PDE5 inhibitor use and
melanoma risk were somewhat higher for individuals in the South region, for those with higher
deprivation, for non-smokers, and among those aged �80 y, but these interactions were com-
patible with chance variation (p � 0.23 in all cases).

 Effect by Specific PDE5 Inhibitor Drug
There was no evidence that the association between PDE5 inhibitor use and melanoma risk dif-
fered by specific PDE5 inhibitor drug (p = 0.42), but the number of melanoma outcomes
among men on drugs other than sildenafil was small (n = 50 and n = 12 events for tadalafil and
vardenafil, respectively), leading to limited power.

 Sensitivity Analyses
In sensitivity analyses, the observed increase in risk of melanoma among PDE5 inhibitor users
was of similar magnitude to that estimated in the main analysis when the analysis was
restricted to those diagnosed with diabetes prior to index date (HR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.81–1.52,
p = 0.51) and when the first year after the index date was excluded from analysis (HR = 1.13,
95% CI 0.99–1.29, p = 0.07), though—as expected due to the reduced numbers—confidence
intervals were wider.
Post Hoc Analysis—Association between Prior Solar Keratosis and
Initiating a PDE5 Inhibitor
Adjusted conditional logistic regression showed overwhelming evidence of a positive associa-
tion between having a prior diagnosis of solar keratosis and initiating a PDE5 inhibitor
(OR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.23–1.34, p < 0.001; Table 3).

 Discussion
In this large population-based matched cohort study, we found weak evidence of a positive
association between exposure to a PDE5 inhibitor and risk of malignant melanoma after
matching or adjusting for key potential confounders. However, further analyses strongly sug-
gested that this observed association was non-causal and explained by greater sun exposure
among PDE5 inhibitor users. A number of observations support this conclusion. First, among

 those exposed to a PDE5 inhibitor, there was no increase in risk with a greater cumulative
number of PDE5 inhibitor prescriptions received or with longer time since first exposure. Sec-
ond, the association was non-specific: in negative control analyses, a similar increased risk of
two other sun-exposure-related outcomes (basal cell carcinoma and solar keratosis) was
observed among PDE5 inhibitor users. There was no increase in risk for colorectal cancer,
which is unrelated to sun exposure. Third, we found strong evidence in a post hoc analysis that
PDE5 inhibitor users were more likely to have had solar keratosis prior to their first PDE5
inhibitor prescription, suggesting that PDE5 inhibitor users were more likely to have experi-
enced excess sun or UV exposure than non-users, even before starting a PDE5 inhibitor.
Strengths and Limitations of the Study
This large study included all patients with an incident PDE5 inhibitor prescription in CPRD
over a 15-y period, so we had high power to detect even a relatively small effect size. We used a
number of approaches to assess causality, including investigating whether there was a dose-
response relationship with regard to the number of prescriptions received, using several nega-
tive control outcomes, and investigating evidence for pre-exposure differences in sun/UV
exposure. By using primary care data, we were able to include data on important potential con-
founders related to lifestyle and socioeconomic status, namely, smoking status, alcohol use,
deprivation, and BMI. We conducted a number of sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness
of our findings.
There were also important limitations to our study. First, we had no patient-level data on
sun/UV exposure, which is the most important known non-genetic factor associated with
malignant melanoma. Patients were matched on general practice and therefore on geographical
area of residence; this is likely to have reduced any differences in sun exposure related to
region, but there may still have been differences in amount of time spent outdoors, number of
foreign holidays, and use of tanning beds. Our secondary analysis, which adjusted for a mea-
sure of deprivation based on residential area for patients with available data, is likely to have
reduced residual confounding since people from the same socioeconomic group are more likely
to be similar in terms of these characteristics. Given the lack of any direct data on sun and UV
exposure, we made use of data on other outcomes known to be related to sun exposure to assess
the likely impact of residual confounding: we investigated basal cell carcinoma and solar kera-
tosis as negative control outcomes, and we looked at differences in prior solar keratosis between
exposed and unexposed patients to investigate whether sun exposure might be associated with
prescription of a PDE5 inhibitor. We also lacked information regarding skin type and family
history of melanoma, which are both known to be associated with melanoma. Furthermore,
due to the low number of patients prescribed tadalafil and vardenafil, we had limited power to
detect differences in the associations between specific PDE5 inhibitor drugs and melanoma
risk.
Another important limitation is the potential for misclassified exposure status. Primary care
prescriptions are well captured in CPRD because, in nearly all cases, prescriptions are issued
electronically and therefore recorded automatically. However, there are no data on whether a
patient has actually filled the assigned prescription or taken the drug. Furthermore, PDE5
inhibitors may have been purchased without prescription by some patients included as con-
trols. It is also possible that men in the control group could have received a PDE5 inhibitor pre-
scription from a specialist outside primary care. To our knowledge, there are no published data
on the extent of online purchasing of PDE5 inhibitors or on the prescribing of these drugs by
specialists, but under the UK healthcare system we believe that the vast majority of routine
PDE5 inhibitor prescriptions would have been issued within primary care. Nevertheless, these

 forms of exposure misclassification could have led to an underestimation of any real difference
in outcomes between exposed and unexposed patients. Although we were unable to distinguish
between therapeutic indications for these medications, we included only PDE5 inhibitor for-
mulations that are recommended for the treatment of ED in the British National Formulary
[1] in order to obtain a relatively homogeneous study population in terms of drug indication.
Due to overlapping indications, we cannot be sure that all of the PDE5 inhibitors were pre-
scribed for treatment of ED; however, it is worth noting that any causal effect of PDE5 inhibi-
tors on melanoma risk would be expected to be independent of the clinical indication, so one
would not expect the inclusion of a minority of men with other indications to lead to serious
underestimation of any true causal effect.
Patients in CPRD are broadly representative of the wider UK population. However, during
the study period, PDE5 inhibitors were subsidised by the National Health Service only for peo-
ple specifically experiencing distress due to ED or whose ED was linked to specific comorbidi-
ties, and this could limit the ability to generalise our findings to all PDE5 inhibitor users.
However, our preliminary descriptive analyses suggested that these drugs were prescribed
widely to individuals who did not have any record of specific qualifying medical conditions,
likely justified by patient “distress”, which qualified men to receive the drug and could have
been interpreted widely. So, in practice, it is likely that patients across the clinical spectrum
were represented in the study. Furthermore, if there were a true causal increase in risk of mela-
noma with PDE5 inhibitor use, it is likely that this would be observed even in a clinically
selected population. We would caution against generalising our results to populations with a
substantially different ethnic mix to the UK population, since ethnicity is likely to be an impor-
tant predictor of melanoma risk. We had insufficient data on ethnicity to investigate this as an
effect modifier.
Melanoma outcomes could have been misclassified if cancer diagnoses in CPRD were not
reliable. However, a recent validation study found that 87% of melanoma cases reported in
CPRD were also recorded in cancer registries and that 96% of melanoma cases reported in can-
cer registries were also reported in CPRD [21], suggesting minimal misclassification. We did
not have data on melanoma stage at diagnosis so were unable to assess associations between
PDE5 inhibitor exposure and melanoma of different stages.
Comparison with Other Studies
The present study is, to our knowledge, the largest to date to investigate the association
between PDE5 inhibitor use and malignant melanoma risk, and the strength of association that
we observed was consistent with that found by Loeb et al. in a recent study using Swedish regis-
try data (OR for PDE5 inhibitor use: 1.21, 95% CI 1.08–1.36) [6] and considerably smaller than
the association reported by Li et al. in the 2014 US cohort study that originally raised concerns
on this topic (HR for sildenafil use: 1.84, 95% CI 1.04–3.22) [5]. Our findings, along with those
from the aforementioned Swedish registry study, would appear to rule out a true association of
the magnitude originally reported by Li et al., since even at the upper 95% confidence limits,
estimates from the two more recent studies are incompatible with anything greater than a
29%–36% increase in risk. As with the Swedish registry study, we found an association between
PDE5 inhibitor exposure and basal cell carcinoma. We also included colorectal cancer as a neg-
ative control outcome unrelated to sun exposure and found no association with PDE5 inhibitor
use, suggesting that differential ascertainment due to health seeking behaviours or healthcare
contact is unlikely to explain the increase in observed risk of melanoma. Like Loeb et al., we
found no relationship between the number of PDE5 inhibitor prescriptions and melanoma
risk, which argues against a causal relationship. Our post hoc finding of an association between

 prior solar keratosis diagnosis and initiation of a PDE5 inhibitor adds a unique insight, which
we think makes a compelling case for the observed association being driven by confounding by
sun or UV exposure. Our study population and data source have similarities with those used
by Loeb et al.; in both cases, a large European population-based cohort was derived from elec-
tronic health records. One notable difference was that we observed a less striking socioeco-
nomic gradient among PDE5 inhibitor users than Loeb et al. observed. However, unlike in the
Swedish data source, which included individual-level information on socioeconomic status, the
deprivation measure that we used was based on patient postal district only. Perhaps more
importantly, PDE5 inhibitors are subsidised by the National Health Service in the UK, unlike
in Sweden, so one would not expect as strong a relationship between socioeconomic factors
and PDE5 inhibitor use. In contrast to the two European studies, the original study by Li et al.
used a much smaller dataset from a specific cohort of US health professionals. Exposure to sil-
denafil was self-reported as recent use at a single point in calendar time, and only those answer-
ing the question were included, introducing a potential for both misclassification of exposure
and selection bias. Outcomes were also self-reported from biennial surveys. However, a unique
strength of that study was inclusion of data relating to UV exposure, which should have
reduced confounding, though these data were also self-reported and likely to have been prone
to reporting error. One point worth noting is that Li et al. did not find an increased risk of
basal cell carcinoma, which would be expected if confounding by sun exposure explained their
findings for melanoma. If, as our results strongly suggest, there is no true causal association
between PDE5 inhibitor use and melanoma, then the findings from the study by Li et al. may
have been driven by some other bias mechanism.
Conclusion
This large matched cohort study using data from UK primary care strongly suggests that the
previously reported association between PDE5 inhibitors and malignant melanoma is not
causal. Consistent with recent data from Sweden [6], we found weak evidence of a small
increased risk of melanoma among PDE5 inhibitor users in our primary analysis; however,
greater exposure did not appear to be associated with higher risk, the association was not spe-
cific to melanoma and was also observed for other sun-exposure-related conditions, and there
was strong evidence that exposed patients were more likely to have had high sun or UV expo-
sure, even before their first PDE5 inhibitor prescription.
