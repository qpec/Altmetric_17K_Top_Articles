 Human adenovirus type 4 (HAdV-4) is most commonly iso-
lated in military settings. We conducted detailed molecular 
characterization on 36 HAdV-4 isolates recovered from 
civilian adults with acute respiratory disease (ARD) in the 
northeastern United States during 2011–2015. Specimens 
came from college students, residents of long-term care fa-
cilities or nursing homes, a cancer patient, and young adults 
without co-morbidities. HAdV-4 genome types 4a1 and 4a2, 
the variants most frequently detected among US military 
recruits in basic training before the restoration of vaccina-
tion protocols, were isolated in most cases. Two novel a-like 
variants were recovered from students enrolled at a college 
in Tompkins County, New York, USA, and a prototype-like 
variant distinguishable from the vaccine strain was isolated 
from an 18-year-old woman visiting a physician’s office in 
Ulster County, New York, USA, with symptoms of influenza-
like illness. Our data suggest that HAdV-4 might be an un-
derestimated causative agent of ARD among civilian adults.
H
uman adenovirus type 4 (HAdV-4), the only human 
adenovirus classified within species E, was first iden-
tified in the early 1950s in association with military out-
breaks of febrile respiratory illness and is well-recognized 
worldwide as a prevalent causative agent of acute respira-
tory disease (ARD) and ocular disease (1–6). Surveillance 
studies conducted in the United States and other countries 
have demonstrated a leading role for this particular adeno-
virus type in the etiology of outbreaks of febrile respiratory 
illness in military recruit training facilities (7–11), where 
crowding and environmental contamination appear to facil-
itate transmission among nonvaccinated trainees (12,13). 
By using restriction enzyme analyses of viral DNA, sev-
eral studies have reported extensive intratypic genetic vari-
ability for HAdV-4 (14–16). Two major clusters of genetic 
homology have been identified among circulating genomic 
variants: prototype (p)–like viruses, which are closely re-
lated to prototype strain RI-67, and a-like viruses, which 
exhibit, among other characteristics, distinct BamHI re-
striction profiles (15), a distinct inverted terminal repeat 
(17,18), and a different genetic make-up in the E3 region 
(A.E. Kajon, unpub. data).
HAdV-4 respiratory infections are preventable by vac-
cination with the live oral  formulation of the nonattenuated 
p-like strain exclusively licensed for military use (19,20). 
After 15 years of discontinuation of HAdV-4 vaccination 
protocols with the consequent resurgence of continuous 
outbreaks of HAdV-4–associated illness in US recruit 
training facilities nationwide, US Department of Defense 
reinstated the vaccine in November 2011, dramatically 
reducing the number of cases of HAdV infection in basic 
training camps (21,22).
The absence of a sentinel system for HAdV surveil-
lance outside of the military has made assessing the burden 
of disease attributable to HAdV-4 infection among civil-
ians difficult. The limited epidemiologic data available in 
the published literature suggest that respiratory disease as-
sociated with HAdV-4 infection is detected at a significant-
ly lower frequency than disease associated with species C 
or B HAdV types among children and that HAdV-4 infec-
tion occurs rarely among civilian adults (23–27).
Consequently, the apparent increased frequency of de-
tection of cases and case clusters of HAdV-4 respiratory 
infection in the northeastern United States, documented

 SYNOPSIS
by the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) 
or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
(data not shown), caught our attention. In this article, we 
report the molecular characterization of 36 select HAdV-4 
isolates from a selection of retrospectively evaluated cases 
among civilians.
Methods
Source of Specimens
We obtained HAdV-4–positive specimens from patients 
with ARD/influenza-like illness (ILI) characterized by fe-
ver >37.8°C and cough, sore throat, or other respiratory 
symptoms. We selected cases that were originally identified 
by the NYSDOH as part of its activities for the US Sentinel 
Physician ILI Surveillance Network (https://www.cdc.gov/
flu/weekly/pdf/flu-surveillance-overview) or that represent-
ed special HAdV cases referred to the CDC for investiga-
tion because of their clinical disease severity or occurrence 
during an outbreak. Institutional review board review was 
not required for the processing of clinical samples or for 
the evaluation of patient information, which were obtained 
during routine diagnostic workups at the Clinical Virology 
Laboratory, Yale–New Haven Hospital (New Haven, Con-
necticut, USA), and the University of Rochester Medical 
Center (Rochester, New York, USA). Review board ap-
proval was also not required for the typing protocol used 
on deidentified HAdV isolates at the Lovelace Respiratory 
Research Institute (Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA).
Virus Isolation and Initial Identification
Virus isolation from respiratory specimens and typing was 
performed at CDC (Atlanta, Georgia, USA) or the Virol-
ogy Laboratory, Wadsworth Center NYSDOH (Albany, 
New York, USA). The virus isolates were initially iden-
tified as HAdV-4 by molecular procedures as previously 
described (28,29).
Genome Typing by Restriction Enzyme Analysis
Cultured isolates were shipped to Lovelace Respiratory 
Research Institute for propagation and extraction of intra-
cellular viral DNA from infected A549 cell monolayers as 
previously reported (30). We digested viral DNA samples 
with a panel of 6 endonucleases to identify genomic vari-
ants following the initial guidelines of Li and Wadell (15) 
and as previously applied to the genomic characterization 
of US military strains (16) to facilitate comparisons. In 
brief, we digested 1 μg of purified viral DNA with BamHI, 
DraI, EcoRI, EcoRV, SmaI, and XhoI (New England Bio-
labs, Ipswich, MA, USA) in a 20-μL reaction following the 
manufacturer’s recommended conditions. For the isolates 
selected for complete genomic sequencing, we performed 
genome typing by in silico digestion of their viral DNA 
with the same panel of enzymes using Geneious Pro 9 (Bio-
matters Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand) (31).
Genome Sequencing and Analysis
We then carried out next-generation sequencing reactions 
at the Wadsworth Center’s Applied Genomics Technol-
ogy Core with the purified viral genomic DNA prepared 
at Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute. The 12 iso-
lates that were selected for next-generation sequencing 
were representative of the set of identified variants on the 
basis of restriction enzyme analysis, location, and date of 
detection. We prepared libraries with the NexteraXT kit 
(Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and performed paired-
end sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq using the NextSeq 
500 cycle v2 kit (Illumina). We assembled all genomic 
sequences de novo using the Illumina BaseSpace cloud 
application for SPAdes 3.5 (http://spades.bioinf.spbau.ru/
release3.5.0/manual.html); we then remapped the sample 
sequences to the consensus sequence using Geneious Pro 
9 (https://www.geneious.com/). Confirmation of sequence 
accuracy for specific regions of the genome was carried out 
by Sanger sequencing of PCR amplicons as needed. We an-
notated the HAdV-4 genomes using curated reference se-
quences available for the prototype RI-67 strain (GenBank 
accession no. AY594253), the vaccine strain CL68578 
(GenBank accession no. AY487947), and several military 
isolates representing previously described genomic vari-
ants (GenBank accession nos. EF371058, AY599837, and 
AY599835).
For phylogenetic analysis, we aligned the genomic 
sequences generated in this study with reference strains 
(Table 1) using MAFFT in Geneious Pro 9. We construct-
ed a maximum-likelihood tree on the basis of the Kimura 
2-parameter model (32) with 500 bootstrap replicates using 
MEGA6 (33).
Results
Case Descriptions
The HAdV-4–positive ARD/ILI cases we evaluated oc-
curred in otherwise healthy teenagers, young adults in col-
lege, and older adult patients who were residing in long-
term care facilities, with 1 older adult patient hospitalized 
in a cancer center. Some cases required prolonged hospital-
ization or had fatal outcomes.
Nosocomial Outbreak of HAdV-4 Respiratory Infection  
in Long-Term Care Facility for Elderly—Boston, 
Massachusetts, April–May 2006
A detailed description of this outbreak was published by 
Kandel et al. in 2010 (34). In brief, the outbreak occurred in 
a unit with 40 residents of mean age 88 (range 66–99) years. 
During April–May 2006, fifteen residents had symptoms

of ARD. HAdV-4 infection was confirmed for 4 residents 
who had positive virus culture results through PCR am-
plification and sequencing of the hexon hypervariable re-
gions 1–6 as described by Lu and Erdman (28). The na-
sopharyngeal aspirates from 3 symptomatic residents gave 
negative virus culture results, and the remaining 8 residents 
were not sampled. Three of the 4 patients with confirmed 
HAdV-4 infections died of complications from ARD. Iso-
lates from 2 of the confirmed cases of HAdV-4–associated 
pneumonia identified during this outbreak were processed 
for viral DNA extraction and detailed characterization. The 
2 respiratory isolates were genome typed as variant 4a1 
by restriction enzyme analysis at Lovelace Respiratory Re-
search Institute.
Adult Case of Severe Pneumonia—Connecticut, July 2011
One author (M.L.L.) was involved in testing, consulting, 
and advising on this case as the clinical laboratory director 
and as an infectious disease specialist. A 26-year-old man 
with an unremarkable medical history sought treatment at 
an emergency department for a 3-day illness involving se-
vere headache, photophobia, nausea, vomiting, and chills. 
He had seen his doctor 2 days earlier and was treated with 
azithromycin without improvement. His lumbar puncture 
results were normal, but a chest radiograph showed a left up-
per lobe infiltrate. Blood work showed a normal white blood 
cell count with 27% band cells, anemia, thrombocytopenia, 
and elevated creatinine. The patient was admitted and treat-
ed with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. On the following day, 
he experienced severe respiratory distress, so he was intu-
bated and transferred to intensive care. His nasopharyngeal 
swab tested positive by panadenovirus PCR at the Clinical 
Virology Laboratory, Yale New Haven Hospital. On the 5th 
day after hospital admission, the patient remained febrile, 
and his chest radiograph showed diffuse bilateral infiltrates; 
dialysis was initiated for a creatinine of 4.9 mg/dL (or 430 
µmol/L, reference range 53–106 µmol/L). By using the pan-
adenovirus PCR, the plasma viral load was determined to be 
1.16 × 104 copies/mL. Molecular typing conducted at CDC 
confirmed the presence of HAdV-4 in both the nasopha-
ryngeal swab and plasma specimens. By using a HAdV-4–
specific PCR (35), the plasma viral load was determined to 
be 5.00 × 105 copies/mL. The patient eventually recovered 
with supportive therapy. The HAdV-4 isolate obtained from 
the nasopharyngeal swab was genome typed at Lovelace 
Respiratory Research Institute as variant 4a2 by restriction 
enzyme analysis.
Cases of ILI among College Students—New York, 2011–2015
During December 2011–October 2015, several HAdV-4–
positive cases were identified at the Wadsworth Center Vi-
rology Laboratory among students enrolled at 7 colleges in 
6 New York counties (Table 2; Figure 1). Persons arrived 
at their corresponding student health clinics with symptoms 
of ILI but tested negative for influenza by the CDC hu-
man influenza virus real-time reverse transcriptase PCR 
diagnostic panel. Four different HAdV-4 genomic variants 
were isolated from this group of patients 18–25 years of 
age (Table 2).
Additional Cases of HAdV-4 Infection Identified by  
ILI Surveillance—New York, 2011–2015
During 2011–2015, ILI surveillance efforts identified 5 
additional cases of acute HAdV-4 respiratory infection of 
variable severity (Table 2; Figure 1). These cases included 
infections in 2 adult patients (NY3 and NY25) sampled in

 SYNOPSIS
physicians’ offices, a case of pneumonia reported in a nurs-
ing home (NY9), a fatal case involving respiratory compli-
cations in a patient at a cancer center (NY10), and a case 
of ARD detected in a teenager at a pediatric clinic (NY23).
Adult Case of Severe Pneumonia— 
Ontario County, New York, August 2012
One author (M.M.) was involved in testing, consulting, 
and advising on this case as the director of the Virology 
Laboratory at the Strong Memorial Hospital, University 
of Rochester Medical Center. A 43-year-old woman with 
cough and an unremarkable medical history sought treat-
ment at the emergency department of University of Roch-
ester Medical Center, Monroe County (NY8; Table 2; 
Figure 1). She was prescribed levofloxacin for presumed 
community-acquired pneumonia and sent home. Four days 
later, she was admitted with worsening cough, shortness 
of breath, and rigors and was found to have bilateral infil-
trates on chest radiograph, anemia, and leukocytosis. She 
subsequently required intubation for declining respiratory 
status. Despite treatment with multiple broad-spectrum 
antimicrobial drugs, she experienced severe hypoxic hy-
percarbic respiratory failure requiring venous-venous ex-
tracorporeal mechanical oxygenation. Her nasopharyngeal 
swab was positive for HAdV by FilmArray (BioFire Di-
agnostics, bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France). She was 
treated with 3 doses of cidofovir. Her hospital course was 
complicated by severe acute kidney injury, acute tubular 
necrosis, and anuria requiring continuous veno-venous he-
mofiltration. Additional complications included cerebral 
edema, intracranial hemorrhage, and persistent hyperten-
sion. She was weaned from the ventilator after 40 days 
and was discharged to in-patient rehabilitation on day 53 
of hospitalization. A year after discharge, she continued to 
experience bronchiectasis and dyspnea on exertion but had 
otherwise returned to her previous level of function. HAdV 
was isolated from cultures of the patient’s tracheal aspi-
rate and nasopharyngeal swab, and a PCR of her peripheral

blood demonstrated a virus load of 3.47 × 105 copies/mL. 
Molecular typing at the Wadsworth Center identified the 
virus as HAdV-4. The HAdV-4 isolate was genome typed 
as variant 4a1 by both in vitro and in silico restriction en-
zyme analyses (Table 2).
Virology Findings
Among these 36 select cases (some associated with out-
breaks and some epidemiologically unlinked ARD cases) 
that occurred during 2009–2015 in the northeastern Unit-
ed States, 5 different genomic variants of HAdV-4 were 
identified by gel-based or in silico restriction enzyme 
analysis (Figure 2). Isolate NY25 (GenBank accession no. 
KY996447) was identified as 4p-like (Figure 3) and was in-
distinguishable from the prototype strain RI-67 or the vac-
cine strain CL68578 by restriction enzyme analysis (Figure 
2). Of the 35 a-like isolates, 18 were classified as genome 
type 4a1, 12 as genome type 4a2, 4 as genome type 4a SmaI 
v (having a 4a-like genome with a novel SmaI profile), and 
1 as genome type 4a SmaI/XhoI v (having a 4a-like genome 
with novel SmaI and XhoI profiles) (Table 2).
To investigate a possible transmission event of the vac-
cine strain administered orally to US military recruits since 
October 2011 (22), we further characterized the 4p-like 
strain isolated from case NY25 by whole-genome sequenc-
ing. We identified 10 point mutations scattered throughout 
the genome (6 nonsynonymous and a 3-nt [CAG] in-frame 
insertion at position 23402 within the L4 coding region and 
open reading frame of the 100-kDa protein), distinguishing 
the 2015 isolate from the vaccine strain, CL68578. Phylo-
genetic analysis of HAdV-4 genomic sequences (Figure 3) 
also showed this isolate to be more closely related to strains 
RI-67 and CL68578 than to strain NHRC 90339 (GenBank 
accession no. EF371058), which was isolated at the Coast 
Guard Recruit Training Center (Cape May, New Jersey, 
USA) in 2001 and is representative of genome type 4p4, 
the only p-like variant detected at military training facilities 
through 2011 (16) (A.E. Kajon, unpub. data). The phyloge-
netic analysis revealed 2 major clades, recapitulating the 
original observations and genomic clustering of variants 
by Li and Wadell (15). The analysis also showed the SmaI 
variant to be closely related to genome type 4a1 and the 
SmaI/XhoI variant to be closely related to genome type 4a2.
Discussion
Enhanced influenza surveillance by public health labora-
tories initiated after the emergence of pandemic influen-
za A(H1N1) in 2009, as well as the wider availability of 
molecular diagnostic assays for multiple viral pathogens, 
have resulted in increased diagnostic efforts to determine 
the etiology of influenza-negative ILI, with consequent 
increased detection of HAdV-associated ARD. As part of 
our ongoing collaborative efforts to describe the molecular 
epidemiology and determine the prevalence of HAdV-as-
sociated respiratory disease, we examined HAdV-4 isolates 
recovered from college students with acute febrile respi-

(ILI), by HAdV-4 type, by type

specimens were collected from 
patients with ILI at physicians’

 SYNOPSIS
HAdV-4 isolates. Two of these variants, 4a1 and 4a2, had 
been previously identified in association with outbreaks of 
febrile respiratory illness in military recruit training facili-
ties in the United States and found to be highly prevalent in 
the basic training environment nationwide before reinstate-
ment of recruit vaccination protocols in 2011 (16) (A.E. 
Kajon, unpub. data). The genomic variant 4a1 was isolated 
from the respiratory specimens of 18 of 36 civilians and 
4a2 from the respiratory specimens of 12 of 36 civilians 
retrospectively examined in this study. Two previously 
unreported variants closely related to 4a1 (SmaI v, n = 4) 
and 4a2 (SmaI/XhoI v, n = 1) were identified among the 8 
examined cases detected at college 4 in Tompkins County, 
New York. Surprisingly, a p-like, vaccine-like strain was 
isolated from a respiratory specimen obtained from an 
18-year-old woman (case NY25) at a physician’s office in 
Ulster County, New York, in February 2015. The genome 
of this clinical isolate (15–4054; Table 1) had a close simi-
larity to the vaccine strain CL68578, and the NYSDOH 
epidemiology team confirmed contact between this patient 
and an active member of the military. However, the muta-
tions distinguishing the genome of this isolate from that of 
the vaccine strain exclude possible transmission from this 
source. Evolution of this p-like virus from the vaccine strain 
is highly likely, considering the ability of HAdV-4 to estab-
lish persistent infections in gut lymphoid tissue (36) and 
that vaccinated persons shed the infectious-nonattenuated 
 
vaccine strain in their stool (37).

Figure 2. In silico restriction enzyme analysis of human adenovirus type 4 genomes representing the spectrum of genetic variability 
of the 36 isolates characterized in study of acute respiratory infection detected in the northeastern United States, 2011–2015. We 
generated restriction enzyme profiles for the completely sequenced genomes obtained in this study and from reference sequences 
available in GenBank using Geneious Pro (31). 4p4 MIL is isolate NHR90339, 4a1 MIL is isolate NHRC3, and 4a2 MIL is isolate 
42606; 4a SmaI v is isolate NY11 (GenBank accession no. KY996449) and 4a SmaI/XhoI v is isolate NY24 (GenBank accession no. 
KY996446). MIL, military isolate; v, variant; Vac, vaccine strain.
  Adenovirus Type 4 Infections, United States
1997–2011 demonstrated the lack of circulation of vaccine-
like strains in the military environment during the 15 years 
of clear dominance of this re-emerging type as a causative 
agent of febrile respiratory illness in US recruit training 
camps (16). Unfortunately, no studies have reported ge-
nome typing data for civilian isolates obtained during the 
same period. A p-like variant designated 4p4 was identi-
fied as the only HAdV-4 genomic variant detected among 
military trainees at the US Coast Guard Training Center 
in Cape May through 2011 and, albeit with relatively low 
prevalence, as the only p-like variant circulating at the 
other 7 military training sites under surveillance (16) (A.E. 
Kajon, unpub. data).
Conceivably, exposure of the general population to the 
nonattenuated vaccine strain could have continued through fe-
cal shedding from persons vaccinated during 1971–1997. An-
other possibility is that the p-like variants could have been cir-
culating among civilian communities at low prevalence since 
the 1950s, when they were first identified (2). This topic war-
rants additional research and continued surveillance to further 
our understanding of the dynamics and routes of transmission 
of respiratory HAdVs that have the ability to establish persis-
tent infection in the gut lymphoid tissue.
On the basis of the severity of the clinical presentation 
of some cases in this study, the HAdV-4 vaccine currently 
licensed for military use should be considered a potentially 
valuable resource to prevent disease in susceptible popula-
tions living in closed communities, such as college settings, 
summer camps, and long-term care facilities. Our data and 
reports of cases of severe ARD associated with HAdV-4 in-
fection in Italy and Singapore (38,39) suggest that the role 
of this HAdV type in the etiology of adult civilian ARD 
might have been underestimated in the absence of access to 
molecular (or other) typing resources. Further, in view of 
the results of this study and previous research documenting 
the contribution of HAdV infection to influenza-negative 
ILI (29), the inclusion of HAdV in differential diagnostic 
test panels would be invaluable to better assess the role of 
HAdVs as causative agents of severe respiratory illness and 
to prevent unnecessary treatment of patients with influenza-
negative ILI with anti-influenza agents. In addition, while 
the failure to detect influenza virus does not guarantee the 
virus was never present, the detection of HAdV in these 
cases assists in alleviating concerns regarding influenza 
vaccine failure. Finally, the potential differences in patho-
genicity, transmissibility, and fitness between p-like and 
a-like genomic variants of HAdV-4 that would explain the 
marked predominance of a-like variants in the examined 
collections of HAdV-4–positive respiratory specimens rep-
resenting sampling of ARD in civilian and military popula-
tions in the United States over the past 5 decades (16,40) 
deserve further investigation.
