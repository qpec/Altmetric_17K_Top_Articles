RESEARCH
How did the US EPA and IARC 
reach diametrically opposed conclusions 
on the genotoxicity of glyphosate-based 
herbicides?
Charles M. Benbrook*
Abstract 
Background: The US EPA considers glyphosate as “not likely to be carcinogenic to humans.” The International Agency 
for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified glyphosate as “probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A).” EPA asserts 
that there is no convincing evidence that “glyphosate induces mutations in vivo via the oral route.” IARC concludes 
there is “strong evidence” that exposure to glyphosate is genotoxic through at least two mechanisms known to be 
associated with human carcinogens (DNA damage, oxidative stress). Why and how did EPA and IARC reach such dif-
ferent conclusions?
Results: A total of 52 genotoxicity assays done by registrants were cited by the EPA in its 2016 evaluation of techni-
cal glyphosate, and another 52 assays appeared in the public literature. Of these, one regulatory assay (2%) and 35 
published assays (67%) reported positive evidence of a genotoxic response. In the case of formulated, glyphosate-
based herbicides (GBHs), 43 regulatory assays were cited by EPA, plus 65 assays published in peer-reviewed journals. 
Of these, none of the regulatory, and 49 published assays (75%) reported evidence of a genotoxic response follow-
ing exposure to a GBH. IARC considered a total of 118 genotoxicity assays in six core tables on glyphosate technical, 
GBHs, and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), glyphosate’s primary metabolite. EPA’s analysis encompassed 51 of 
these 118 assays (43%). In addition, IARC analyzed another 81 assays exploring other possible genotoxic mechanisms 
(mostly related to sex hormones and oxidative stress), of which 62 (77%) reported positive results. IARC placed consid-
erable weight on three positive GBH studies in exposed human populations, whereas EPA placed little or no weight 
on them.
Conclusions: EPA and IARC reached diametrically opposed conclusions on glyphosate genotoxicity for three primary 
reasons: (1) in the core tables compiled by EPA and IARC, the EPA relied mostly on registrant-commissioned, unpub-
lished regulatory studies, 99% of which were negative, while IARC relied mostly on peer-reviewed studies of which 
70% were positive (83 of 118); (2) EPA’s evaluation was largely based on data from studies on technical glyphosate, 
whereas IARC’s review placed heavy weight on the results of formulated GBH and AMPA assays; (3) EPA’s evaluation 
was focused on typical, general population dietary exposures assuming legal, food-crop uses, and did not take into 
account, nor address generally higher occupational exposures and risks. IARC’s assessment encompassed data from 
typical dietary, occupational, and elevated exposure scenarios. More research is needed on real-world exposures to 
the chemicals within formulated GBHs and the biological fate and consequences of such exposures.

Background
Markedly different judgements have been reached by the 
US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), European 
regulators, and the International Agency for Research 
on Cancer (IARC) regarding the potential of glyphosate-
based herbicides (GBHs) to cause or contribute to human 
cancer. The EPA and European regulators have concluded 
that glyphosate technical poses no significant cancer risks 
to the general public, based on currently approved, food-
crop uses and the levels of dietary exposure expected in 
the general population (including residues in drinking 
water and beverages) [1–3].
In the IARC summary of the rationale for its Group 
2A “probably carcinogenic to humans” classification of 
glyphosate and GBHs, the Working Group wrote “there 
is strong evidence that glyphosate can operate through 
two key characteristics of known human carcinogens, 
and that these can be operative in humans”: genotoxicity 
(DNA damage) and oxidative stress [4].
In reference to the “strong evidence” of genotoxic-
ity in its summary statement, the IARC Working Group 
highlighted a study in an exposed, human population 
(presumably Bolognesi et al. [5]) in which “markers of 
chromosomal damage (micronucleus formation) were 
significantly greater after exposure than before exposure 
in the same individuals” [4].
Also according to the IARC Working Group, there is 
“strong evidence” that glyphosate, GBHs, and glypho-
sate’s major metabolite AMPA can induce oxidative 
stress in animal studies and in in vitro human cell assays. 
Moreover, IARC stressed that observed oxidative stress 
in several assays was ameliorated by administration of 
an antioxidant, lending further support to this second 
mechanism of action (e.g. [6, 7]).
In March 2015, IARC classified glyphosate and GBHs 
as “probably carcinogenic to humans” [8]. This unex-
pected classification set off intense debate across and 
among key scientific and regulatory institutions, the orig-
inal registrant of GBHs (Monsanto), and scientists pub-
lishing research on, or relevant to the assessment of GBH 
carcinogenicity [9–14].
IARC initially released its full Monograph Volume 112 
report on glyphosate and GBH carcinogenicity on July 
29, 2015, and subsequently issued a slightly revised, final 
version in January 2017 [4]. A summary of the IARC’s 
classification decision was first published online March 
25, 2015 in Lancet Oncology [8]. As the case with all 
IARC reviews, the Working Group assessing glyphosate 
and GBH carcinogenicity relied predominantly on pub-
licly available, peer-reviewed studies. The basis of IARC’s 
Group 2A “probably carcinogenic to humans” classifica-
tion is summarized in Sect. 6.4 “Rationale” in the Mono-
graph Volume 112 report, and reads in part:
“In making this overall evaluation, the Working 
Group noted that the mechanistic and other rel-
evant data support the classification of glyphosate 
in Group 2A. In addition to limited evidence for the 
carcinogenicity of glyphosate in humans and suffi-
cient evidence for the carcinogenicity of glyphosate 
in experimental animals, there is strong evidence 
that glyphosate can operate through two key char-
acteristics of known human carcinogens, and that 
these can be operative in humans” [4].
Focus of EPA and EFSA glyphosate risk assessments
Recent regulatory judgements on glyphosate cancer risk 
in the US and Europe are based upon an assessment of 
general population, dietary exposures under typical 
conditions, and do not take into account, nor reflect a 
detailed evaluation of the sometimes much-higher levels 
of exposure that occur in a variety of occupational mixer/
loader and applicator scenarios [15], e.g., hand-held, 
backpack, ATV, and truck-mounted sprayers that require 
a person to hold and direct an application wand. Such 
applications lead to much higher dermal exposures com-
pared to applicators working inside tractor or sprayer 
cabs. In addition, applying a GBH many days per year for 
several hours per day inevitably leads to greater, routine 
dermal exposures, as well as more numerous incidents 
during which significantly greater than normal exposures 
occur because of a leaky hose or value, wind conditions, a 
spill, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstance.
EPA’s comprehensive report on the carcinogenicity 
of glyphosate was released in September 2016 [3]. After 
presenting a detailed assessment of registrant-conducted 
animal bioassays, published epidemiological studies, 
and the genotoxicity database on glyphosate technical 
(but not GBHs, see below for why), Sect. 6.6 of the EPA 
report contrasts the information and evidence the agency 
reviewed relative to the five different cancer classifica-
tions set forth in its 2005 cancer guidelines: carcinogenic 
to humans; likely to be carcinogenic to humans; sugges-
tive evidence of carcinogenic potential; inadequate infor-
mation to assess carcinogenic potential; and, not likely to 
be carcinogenic to humans [16]. These classifications are 
roughly equivalent to IARC’s categories: Group 1 (carci-
nogenic to humans); Group 2A (probably carcinogenic); 
Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic); Group 3 (not classifi-
able); and, Group 4 (probably not carcinogenic) [17].
Based on EPA’s weight-of-the-evidence review of data 
mostly from studies on glyphosate technical, the agency 
concluded that “The strongest support is for ‘not likely to 
be carcinogenic to humans’ at doses relevant for human 
health risk assessment” (emphasis added) [3]. Such “rel-
evant doses,
” as discussed in the EPA assessment, arise

from residues in food and beverages following legal, 
labelled food-crop applications of a GBH.
Other regulatory authorities have mostly concurred 
with the EPA’s judgement, for essentially the same rea-
sons [1, 2, 18]. Regulatory agencies other than the US 
EPA cite mostly the same set of registrant-conducted 
studies as EPA, supplemented to one degree or another, 
by a portion of the studies in the peer-reviewed literature 
that formed the primary basis of IARC’s review.
Since March of 2015, papers have been published gen-
erally supporting and/or defending the IARC determina-
tion [9, 10, 19–21], while others have criticized IARC’s 
conclusion and/or addressed why the EPA and other reg-
ulatory-agency judgements should be accepted as more 
surely based on “sound science” [2, 14, 22, 23]. A few 
papers have attempted to explain why IARC and the US 
EPA reached such different conclusions [11, 24]. IARC 
distributed a January 2018 “Briefing Note for IARC Sci-
entific and Governing Council Members” responding to a 
number of criticisms and erroneous claims regarding the 
deliberations of the Working Group [25].
GBHs should be the focus of risk assessments
It is important to emphasize that in the case of glypho-
sate, the vast majority of registrant-conducted animal 
studies, and all the chronic studies, have dosed animals 
with technical glyphosate. Hence, the key toxicologi-
cal parameters embedded in EPA and other regulatory, 
human-health risk assessments reflect risks stemming 
from exposure to glyphosate technical in the absence of 
co-formulants.
This is inappropriate for three reasons: (1) formulated 
GBHs account for all commercial uses and human expo-
sures (no herbicide products contain just glyphosate), 
(2) regulators are aware that the co-formulants in GBHs 
markedly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, 
excretion, and possibly the toxicity, of the glyphosate in 
formulated GBHs [1–3]; and (3) multiple studies report 
that formulated GBHs are more toxic than glyphosate 
technical (see Table 3 for references and accompanying 
discussion).
The three major pillars of the EPA and IARC evalua-
tions of GBH oncogenic risk to humans are animal bioas-
says, epidemiological studies in exposed populations, and 
genotoxicity studies useful in determining whether there 
are plausible mechanism(s) through which exposure to 
GBHs might trigger or accelerate cancerous cell growth. 
Differences exist in the EPA’s and IARC’s assessments of 
animal bioassay and epidemiological data, but by far the 
most pronounced, and consequential differences arise in 
the area of GBH genotoxicity.
Taking full account of differences in the absorption, dis-
tribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity of technical 
or “pure” glyphosate, in contrast to formulated, glypho-
sate-based herbicides (GBHs) poses many challenges 
for regulators, scientists, and glyphosate manufactur-
ers. According to the European Food Standards Agency 
(EFSA), the purity of glyphosate technical in its evalua-
tion and risk assessment ranges between 95% and 98.3% 
glyphosate [2]. Impurities including N-nitroso-glypho-
sate and formaldehyde make up no more than 1.1% of 
technical glyphosate [2]. Formulated GBHs, on the other 
hand, typically contain between 2 and 60% glyphosate 
and a fraction of 1% to 25% adjuvants, surfactants, and 
other co-formulants.
This analysis strives to shed light on why EPA and 
IARC reached diametrically opposed judgements regard-
ing GBH genotoxicity. The science base cited and relied 
upon by the EPA and IARC in their full evaluation 
reports are contrasted, and also compared to the set of 
studies addressed in several Monsanto-commissioned 
review articles [14, 22, 26, 27]. Differences in the evi-
dentiary foundation and technical focus of the EPA and 
IARC, as they undertook their genotoxicity assessments, 
are described, as are the ways these differences altered 
the weight accorded to different studies and lines of 
evidence.
Methods
Section 5.3 of the September 2016 EPA evaluation of 
glyphosate carcinogenicity [3] includes seven tables set-
ting forth the assays the agency considered in the follow-
ing areas:
• Table 5.1. In vitro test for gene mutation in bacte-
ria: glyphosate technical (hereafter Bacterial Reverse 
Mutation Studies);
• Table 5.2. In vitro mammalian gene mutation assays: 
glyphosate technical;
• Table 5.3. In vitro tests for chromosomal aberrations 
in mammalian cells—glyphosate technical;
• Table 5.4. In vitro tests for micronuclei induction in 
mammalia cells—glyphosate technical;
• Table 5.5. In vivo tests for chromosomal aberrations 
in mammals—glyphosate technical;
• Table 5.6. In vivo tests for micronuclei induction in 
mammals—glyphosate technical; and
• Table 5.7. Assays for detecting primary DNA dam-
age—glyphosate technical (hereafter DNA Damage).
Each of these seven tables reports the Test/Endpoint; 
Test [assay] System; Route of Administration; Doses/
Concentration; Test Material Purity (when known); 
Results; References; and, Comments. “Results” typically 
are “positive” or “negative,” and sometimes specify the 
conditions under which a positive/negative response 
 Page 4 of 16

Environ Sci Eur            (2019) 31:2 
was reported (e.g., “Negative ± S9”; “Positive, Statis-
tically significant [p < 0.05] increase in MN at 15 and 
20 mg/L”).
The assay-by-assay information in these core tables 
was moved into an Excel workbook, in which the follow-
ing data were recorded: Year, Author, Result, whether the 
assay was conducted by a registrant (Regulatory) or was 
published in the Public Literature, and Comments. All of 
the above information is recorded as reported in the EPA 
tables noted above. The assay results described in the 
EPA tables were chosen by the agency, and usually were 
also noted in each study’s abstract.
Each of this paper’s tables is organized according to 
whether an assay was conducted with glyphosate techni-
cal (Glyphosate), or a formulated GBH. Also included is 
whether a study or assay was cited by EPA 2016, IARC 
2017, and/or a Monsanto-commissioned review. Addi-
tional file 1: Tables S1–S7 include the above informa-
tion for the studies and assays cited by EPA in seven core 
tables (Tables 5.1–5.7).
In addition, the EPA listed studies on glyphosate-based 
formulations separately in Appendix F, “Genotoxicity 
Studies with Glyphosate Based Formulations” [3]. Assays 
in Tables F.1, F.2, F.3, F.4 and F.5 were added to Additional 
file 1: Tables S1–S7, and incorporated in the present 
analysis.
Summary statistics by type of genotoxicity test and 
assay system were calculated for studies on glyphosate 
technical and formulated GBHs. For regulatory studies, 
public literature studies, and all studies, the number of 
studies, number of positives, and percent positive were 
calculated.
A similar Excel worksheet was constructed from 
all glyphosate-related genotoxicity studies and assays 
cited in Volume 112 of the IARC Monograph series in 
“Sect. 4.2 Mechanisms of carcinogenesis” [4]. The IARC 
Working Group organized its assessment of genotoxicity 
data in six core tables:
• Table 4.1 Genetic and related effects of glyphosate in 
exposed humans;
• Table 4.2 Genetic and related effects of glyphosate, 
AMPA, and glyphosate-based formulations in human 
cells in vitro;
• Table 4.3 Genetic and related effects of glyphosate, 
AMPA, and glyphosate-based formulations in non-
human mammals in vivo;
• Table 4.4 Genetic and related effects of glyphosate, 
AMPA, and glyphosate-based formulations in non-
human mammalian cells in vitro;
• Table 4.5 Genetic and related effects of glyphosate, 
AMPA, and glyphosate-based formulations in non-
mammalian systems in vivo; and
• Table 4.6 Genetic and related effects of glyphosate 
and glyphosate-based formulations on non-mamma-
lian systems in vitro.
Each of the above six, IARC tables covers studies and 
assays done on glyphosate technical, as well as any stud-
ies/assays conducted using a formulated GBH. A few 
studies testing the primary glyphosate metabolite ami-
nomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) are also included in 
the IARC tables. As in the case of the core EPA tables, 
the IARC Working Group selected the assays to describe 
from each study. With a few exceptions entailing indeter-
minate results, each assay was designated as “positive” or 
“negative” for genotoxicity. Hence, the information in this 
paper’s tables on assays considered by the IARC Working 
Group reflect that Working Group’s judgements regard-
ing which of the assays were scientifically valid, relevant, 
and which indicated genotoxic potential versus those that 
did not.
For these six IARC tables, the following information 
was recorded in the Excel workbook: Category of Study, 
Citation (lead author(s) and year), End-point Studied, 
Test/Assay, Response/Results, and Comments. In addi-
tion, the tables note whether a given study/assay was 
cited in a Monsanto-commissioned Review (yes/no) [14, 
22, 26, 27] and/or in the EPA’s September 2016 report 
[3]. Summary statistics are calculated by IARC assay 
category. Additional file 1: Table S8 lists the genotoxic-
ity studies and assays considered by the IARC Working 
Group and records the information described above.
Assays cited by IARC and recorded in Additional file 1: 
Table S8 were then added to Additional file 1: Tables S1–
S7, allowing comparison of the number of studies and 
assays in each of the categories that were cited by EPA, 
IARC, or both.
In addition to the assays cited by IARC in Tables 4.1–
4.6, additional studies are discussed in the narrative of 
the IARC Monograph 112 in Sects. 4.2.2–4.2.4. These 
studies are related to mechanisms of genotoxicity other 
than those listed in the core tables. The majority of these 
studies explore sex hormone disruption and oxidative 
stress. For studies cited in the narrative sections of IARC 
2017, the following information was recorded in Addi-
tional file 1: Table S9: Citation (lead author(s) and date), 
Category, Study type, End-point studied, and Result.
The data in Additional file 1: Tables S1–S9 are inte-
grated and summarized in Additional file 1: Table S10. 
This table lists all assays considered by the EPA and 
IARC, and breaks them down by source (Regulatory or 
Public Literature) and result (Total Number, Number 
Positive, and Percent Positive). Finally, Additional file 1: 
Table S11 reports, for the core IARC and EPA tables, the 
number and results of assays considered by IARC but not 
 Page 5 of 16
Benbrook  
Environ Sci Eur            (2019) 31:2 
by EPA, and the number considered by EPA but not by 
IARC.
Note that many of the studies cited by IARC and EPA 
report results in more than one test system or assay. 
Other studies cover assays testing glyphosate technical, 
AMPA, and formulated GBHs. As a result, the total num-
ber of reported assay results for glyphosate technical, 
AMPA, and GBHs exceeds the number of studies cited 
by EPA, IARC, or in any, or all of the four Monsanto-
commissioned reviews [14, 22, 26, 27]. Also, EPA and 
IARC utilize somewhat different classification systems 
and methods for recording assay results, altering the 
number of assay results reported from a few studies (~ 9 
assays), and account for minor differences in the assay 
counts across Additional file 1: Tables S1–S11.
Throughout this paper, a “negative” assay is one 
reported as negative across all dose levels, as well as 
across all alternative ways a given assay was conducted; 
a “positive” assay is one where the authors reported, and 
IARC and/or EPA concurred, that there was at least one 
statistically significant genotoxic response at one or more 
dose levels.
Results
Table 1 provides an overview of the database available as 
of early 2015 for evaluation of the genotoxicity of glypho-
sate and glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs). The seven 
categories of studies in Table 1 cover assays cited by EPA 
and/or IARC in their analyses [3, 4]. Across all catego-
ries, a total of 52 regulatory assays were cited by EPA on 
glyphosate technical. Another 52 assays appeared in the 
public literature and were cited by EPA, IARC, or both, 
for a total of 104 assays on glyphosate technical.
Of the total 104 assays on glyphosate technical, one 
regulatory assay and 35 published assays reported posi-
tive evidence of a genotoxic response, for a total of 36 
positive assays in the case of glyphosate technical. Thus, 
for glyphosate technical just 2% of the regulatory assays 
and 67% of the assays published in peer-reviewed jour-
nals reported positive results.
While EPA did not consider any assays on AMPA, 
IARC’s analysis did include five assays on the genotoxic-
ity of this major metabolite of glyphosate (all positive).
In the case of formulated GBHs, 43 regulatory assays 
and 65 assays from published literature were cited by 
EPA and/or IARC, for a total of 108. Of these 108, none 
of the regulatory assays reported evidence of a positive 
genotoxic response, while 49 published assays did (75%).
Bacterial reverse mutation assays accounted for 51 out 
of the 95 (54%) regulatory assays submitted to EPA on 
glyphosate technical and formulated GBHs. There were a 
total of 29 assays on glyphosate technical exploring direct 
DNA damage cited by EPA, mostly COMET and sister 
chromatid exchange assays. Of these 29 assays, 27 were 
reported in public literature studies.
Table 2 reports the number of assays on glyphosate 
technical, AMPA, and formulated GBHs cited by IARC 
in the following six categories of studies:
• Exposed humans category (GBHs);
• Human cells in vitro categories (glyphosate technical, 
AMPA, GBHs);
• Non-human mammals in vivo categories (glyphosate 
technical, AMPA, GBHs);
• Non-human mammalian cells in vitro categories 
(glyphosate technical, AMPA, GBHs);
• Non-mammalian systems in vivo categories (glypho-
sate technical, AMPA, GBHs); and
• Non-mammalian systems in vitro categories (glypho-
sate technical, GBHs).
In addition, for each category of study, Table 2 reports 
the number of assays that were also cited in one or more 
of the four Monsanto-commissioned reviews [14, 22, 26, 
27] and by EPA in its September 2016 report [3].
Across all categories of studies in its six core tables, 
IARC considered 118 assays. Of these, Monsanto-com-
missioned reviews cited 84 (71%) and the EPA cited 
51 (43%). In general, both scientists and regulators [3] 
place greater emphasis on mammalian assay systems, in 
contrast to non-mammalian systems, in evaluating the 
mechanisms of toxicity in humans following exposure 
to pesticides. As shown in Table 2, the IARC Working 
Group cited 54 mammalian assays, and 49 (91%) and 40 
(74%) of these were cited in the Monsanto-commissioned 
reviews and by the EPA, respectively.
Of the 51 assays cited by both the EPA and IARC, 24 
report the impact of exposures to GBHs, but these were 
given little weight in the EPA’s assessment of the geno-
toxicity of glyphosate (see “Discussion”). Therefore, EPA’s 
conclusion regarding the genotoxicity of glyphosate was 
based predominantly on the agency’s review of 27 assays 
out of the 118 assays assessed by IARC (51 total IARC 
and EPA assessed assays, minus 24 on GBHs not focused 
on by EPA).
Hence, in its evaluation of glyphosate genotoxicity, 
the EPA took fully into account the results of only 23% 
of the assays considered by IARC (27/118). In addition, 
Additional file 1: Table S11 shows that the EPA took into 
account 61 registrant-commissioned assays on glypho-
sate technical and 48 registrant assays on GBHs that 
were not considered by the IARC Working Group. Of 
these 109 assays, seven (6.4%) were positive. In terms of 
focus, 54 of the 109 assays (49.5%) were from bacterial 
reverse mutation studies (all negative), and 31 (28.4%) 
were in vivo micronuclei induction assays (30 negative).

Environ Sci Eur            (2019) 31:2 
Additional file 1: Table S11 also shows that IARC ana-
lyzed 21, 41, and 5 published assays (total 67), respec-
tively, on glyphosate technical, GBHs, and AMPA that 
were not reviewed or given weight by the EPA, 55 (82%) 
of which were positive.
In order to accurately describe the full genotoxic-
ity database evaluated by IARC, several additional 
studies and assays cited in the Volume 112 narrative 
report have been added to Additional file 1: Table S9 
and are summarized in Additional file 1: Table S10. 
There were 82 assays involving other potential mecha-
nisms of genotoxicity (mainly sex hormone disruption 
and oxidative stress) that were evaluated by the IARC 
Working Group and referenced in the narrative sec-
tion of IARC 2017. These include an additional 53 
assays on glyphosate technical, 4 on AMPA, and 25 
on formulated GBHs, 77% of which reported positive 
results.
When included in the overall analysis (see Additional 
file 1: Table S10), these additional assays bring the total 
number considered by IARC or EPA to 306, 51% of 
which report positive results. 211 of these 306 assays 
are from the public literature, 74% of which reported 
one or more positive result.

The tendency of scientists to not disseminate or seek 
publication of “negative” studies is likely not a factor 
in the case of registrant-commissioned lab studies of 
glyphosate and GBHs, the majority of which are submit-
ted to regulators and report mostly negative results. A 
substantial share (~ 27%) of published assays on glypho-
sate or GBHs done by scientists not working for pesti-
cide manufacturers reported negative results. There is no 
way of knowing how many additional assays have been 
done by registrants with negative or positive results that 
were never submitted to regulators, nor published. It is 
also not possible to project the number of assays done by 
scientists not working for industry that showed positive 
or negative signs of genotoxicity, but were not published.
Discussion
In the IARC Working Group’s “Exposed Humans” table, 
three studies are cited assessing chromosomal aberra-
tions, DNA strand breaks, and micronuclei formation in 
five populations of exposed people [5, 28, 29]. Positive 
evidence of genotoxicity was reported in four of the five 
populations. Only Bolognesi et al. [5] was cited in the 
EPA’s Appendix F Table F.5. “Other assays for detecting 
DNA damage—glyphosate formulations” [3]. The intro-
duction to Appendix F states the following:
“While the focus of this analysis is to determine the 
genotoxic potential of glyphosate, the agency has 
identified numerous studies conducted with glypho-
sate-based formulations that contain various con-

centrations of the glyphosate as well as other com-
ponents of the end use products and are presented in 
Tables F.1–F.5” [3].
In the introduction to Sect. 5 on genotoxicity in its 
2016 report, the EPA writes:
“Studies conducted with glyphosate formulations 
that were identified and considered relevant for gen-
otoxicity evaluation are summarized in table form 
in Appendix F. As described in Sect. 7.0 of this docu-
ment, glyphosate formulations are hypothesized to 
be more toxic than glyphosate alone. The agency is 
collaborating with NTP [National Toxicology Pro-
gram] to systematically investigate the mechanism(s) 
of toxicity for glyphosate and glyphosate formula-
tions. However, the focus of this section [Sect. 5 on 
genotoxicity] is the genotoxic potential of glyphosate 
technical” [3].
In the above passages, the EPA makes clear that it 
based its judgment regarding the genotoxicity of glypho-
sate and GBHs predominantly on studies conducted with 
glyphosate technical. EPA’s choice of words in discussing 
differences in the toxicity of formulated GBHs in contrast 
to glyphosate technical is hard to square with the results 
of multiple, published studies.
Differential toxicity
EPA regards such differences as “hypothesized,
” despite 
many studies reporting that GBHs are, in general, more 
toxic than glyphosate technical [30–32], and sometimes 
by large margins [33, 34], as shown in Table 3. The exam-
ples of differential toxicity in Table 3 are based on the 
levels of glyphosate technical triggering a defined, posi-
tive genotoxicity response in a given assay, in contrast 
to the amount of glyphosate in a GBH that triggers the 
same response. Accordingly, such comparisons are lim-
ited to a specific assay and marker of biological response 
and should be interpreted as only one of many indicators 
of the relative toxicity of a dose of glyphosate in a GBH 
compared to the same dose of glyphosate in the absence 
of co-formulants.
The reasons why the glyphosate in GBHs is more 
toxic than the same amount of glyphosate technical are 
generally agreed upon. Most of the surfactants used in 
the formulation of GBHs are designed to accelerate the 
movement of glyphosate across plant surface membranes 
and also foster the movement of glyphosate into mam-
malian cells [31, 35]. Many co-formulants are more toxic 
than technical glyphosate [31, 36] and synergistic activ-
ity may occur in some exposure scenarios with certain 
formulations. Accordingly, differential toxicity arises 
from variable combinations of the innate toxicity of the 
surfactant(s) in a GBH compared to technical glypho-
sate, the impact of the surfactant(s) on the movement of 
glyphosate through human skin and into cells, and pos-
sible synergistic impacts [30, 37–39].
The EPA goes on to state that it placed greater weight 
on in vivo genotoxicity assays than on those testing 
in vitro exposures, especially for the same endpoint and 
that the only positive in vivo results were seen “at rela-
tively high doses that are not relevant for human health 
risk assessment” [3].
Need to address and mitigate unusual and high 
occupational exposures
The EPA’s September 2016 evaluation of glyphosate carci-
nogenicity is largely focused on typical, expected dietary 
exposures facing the general public. The EPA’s analysis 
does not encompass occupational and unusual exposure 
scenarios, nor circumstances where some problem, error, 
mistake, land use factor, or quirk of nature leads to an 
unusually high GBH-exposure episode.
Periodically, the EPA issues a report covering glypho-
sate exposure and health-impact incident reports. For 
example, between 2002 and 2008, a total of 271 incident 
reports were compiled by EPA, 36% of which involved 
neurological symptoms, 29.5% dermal irritation, rash, 
or hives, and 14% respiratory duress [15]. Common 
causes of such incidents include a slow leak in a hose or 
fitting on a backpack sprayer, leading to the drenching 
over several hours of the applicator’s neck, back, and/or 
legs; repair of an equipment breakdown that inadvert-
ently leads to significant exposure to spray solution; and,

routine maintenance and service of spraying equipment 
and tank cleanup procedures. In the case of large-scale 
spray equipment used to apply a GBH in farm fields or 
large areas, a person repairing a leaky fitting or valve, 
or dealing with clogged nozzles or a blown hose, can be 
heavily exposed in a matter of seconds.
There is a vast array of unusual circumstances leading 
to elevated- to very-high exposure episodes, compared 
to typical, “general population” exposures, that do not 
involve equipment malfunction. Some examples include 
the following:
• A child playing with a dog that has recently spent 
time in an area sprayed with a GBH;
• sugar cane harvesters in Central America work-
ing in a recently burnt field that had been sprayed 
7–10 days earlier with a GBH, creating a possibly 
toxic mix of smoke and GBH residues;
• an applicator on an ATV or driving a truck-mounted 
sprayer that covers an area via a concentric-circle 
spray pattern on a windy day, and
• workers in a rice field adjacent to an irrigation ditch 
recently treated with a GBH for weed control.
More data needed on the distribution of exposure levels
Across all occupationally exposed populations, there is a 
distribution of glyphosate exposure levels ranging from 
modestly above typical, background levels, to manyfold 
higher. Only a few studies have reported sufficient data 
to gain some sense of the distribution of exposure levels 
in an exposed population. One such study focused on 82 
Thai women during their seventh month of pregnancy. 
Kongtip et al. [42] reported the number of women fall-
ing within progressively higher levels of glyphosate in 
maternal serum and umbilical cord blood. Levels varied 
by some 100- to 200-fold, as evident in Fig. 1a, b.
The IARC Working Group placed considerable weight 
on the genotoxicity studies in human populations 
exposed to formulated GBHs (80% of which were posi-
tive), while the EPA did not. These studies reflect high-
end, real-world human-exposure scenarios more closely 
than any other category of study. It is true that the 
populations in these studies lived in or near, or worked 
around areas heavily treated with formulated GBHs, but 
it is also highly likely that millions of people around the 
world applying a GBH on any given day, or living near 
areas where substantial volumes of GBHs are applied, 
are also exposed to elevated levels because of application 
equipment problems, wind conditions, human error, or 
negligence.
Further research is urgently needed to quantify 
urine and serum levels of glyphosate following known, 
high-exposure scenarios. In light of the heightened toxic-
ity of formulated GBHs in contrast to technical glypho-
sate, research is also needed to determinate the levels of 
major GBH surfactants and adjuvants in urine and blood, 
as well as their rate of skin penetration, metabolism and 
excretion. Such data are essential to sort out whether, and 
to what degree, GBH adjuvants and surfactants account 
for the genotoxicity and/or other adverse health effects of 
GBHs, in contrast to exposure to glyphosate technical.
The data generated by such research and biomonitor-
ing will be valuable for regulators and GBH registrants in 
two ways. First, it will help guide future changes in co-
formulants to limit use of those known to increase risks 
through one or more mechanisms. Second, these data 
will help sharpen worker-risk assessments and identify 
under what conditions, and for what uses, additional 
worker-safety precautions and Personal Protective Equip-
ment (PPE) are warranted.
Why so many bacterial reverse mutation studies?
Over one-half (51 out of 95) of all registrant-commis-
sioned genotoxicity studies on glyphosate and GBHs 
report the results of bacterial reverse mutation assays 
(aka Ames tests). The EPA requires just one bacterial 
reverse mutation assay on a pesticide active ingredient 
like glyphosate.
It is not clear why registrants focused so heavily on bac-
terial reverse mutation assays (54% of total assays), nearly 
all of which report the same result (negative). Scientists 
not affiliated with the industry and publishing in peer-
reviewed journals pursued different genotoxicity test-
ing priorities and published only seven bacterial reverse 
mutation assay results (one positive), or 5.7% of the 122 
assays reported in public literature.
In addition to Monsanto, other pesticide companies 
developed their own set of toxicology studies to sup-
port their proprietary GBH brands and hence had to 
fulfil EPA data requirements (e.g., Syngenta, Chemi-
nova). Still, dozens of bacterial reverse mutation studies 
were conducted after data requirements were fulfilled 
and after there was widespread recognition among reg-
ulators and companies that glyphosate, and GBHs pose 
virtually no risk of genotoxicity in bacterial reverse 
mutation assays. The scientific and regulatory “added 
value” of so many bacterial reverse mutation stud-
ies is questionable, other than increasing the number 
of negative studies supporting the safety of glyphosate 
and GBHs. In vitro bacterial reverse mutation assays 
cost much less to run than nearly all other genotoxicity 
assays and hence would be among the least expensive 
options to increase the number of negative assays.

Different outcomes in regulatory and public literature 
studies
Table 1 reports that across all genotoxicity assays on 
glyphosate technical, just 2% of studies sponsored by 
glyphosate registrants reported some positive evi-
dence of a genotoxic response, while 67% of the studies 
in peer-reviewed journals reported one or more posi-
tive result. Given that the same basic genotoxicity assay 
systems were used in carrying out most regulatory and 
public literature studies, this big difference in outcomes 
begs for an explanation.
In some cases, the authors of regulatory studies report 
some evidence of a genotoxic response in a given assay, 
but then classify the study as “negative” because of the 
following:
• The reported result occurred at an excessive dose 
level;
• the dose was toxic to cells via a non-genotoxic mech-
anism; and/or
• the route of administration is regarded as not rel-
evant in human-health risk assessment.
Dozens of examples of the above judgements are 
described in the Monsanto-commissioned, comprehen-
sive reviews of glyphosate and GBH genotoxicity assays 
[14, 22, 26, 27]. In general when compared to stud-
ies in the peer-reviewed literature, regulatory studies 
tend to place more weight on factors that can arguably 
turn a positive assay result into a negative, or equivocal 
one. The criteria and decision process regulators apply

in determining whether the authors of regulatory stud-
ies are justified in dismissing a given positive result are 
generally unknown. This is an area in need of further 
research.
Genotox studies published post‑EPA and IARC reviews
The most recent genotoxicity study evaluated by the 
IARC Working Group [4] and EPA [3] was published in 
January 2015 [43]. From February 2015 through Decem-
ber 24, 2018, at least 27 additional studies have been 
published addressing possible mechanisms of genotoxic 
action for glyphosate and/or formulated GBHs (see 
Table 4). All but one of the 27 studies in Table 4 reported 
one or more positive result: 18 positives arising from 
DNA damage, 6 associated with oxidative stress, and two 
with other genotoxicity mechanisms.
These studies lend further support to the IARC Work-
ing Group’s conclusion that there is “strong evidence” 
that formulated GBHs can trigger cell damage through at 
least two mechanisms of action (DNA damage and oxida-
tive stress), thereby possibly triggering or accelerating the 
progression of cancerous cell growths.
The database supporting assessments of the genotox-
icity of glyphosate and GBHs continues to evolve. Ghisi 
Nde et al. [44] conducted a meta-analysis of studies 
reporting the formation of micronuclei following expo-
sure to glyphosate and/or GBHs. The team reports that 
both glyphosate and GBHs increase the frequency of 
micronuclei formation. Soloneski et al. [45] conducted 
a study in toads comparing the genotoxic impacts of a 
GBH, a dicamba-based herbicide, and a combination of 
these two, formulated herbicides, and concluded that the 
combination of GBH + dicamba herbicide led to a syn-
ergistic effect on the induction of primary DNA breaks. 
This result is worrisome given that well over one-half of 
the soybeans planted in the US in 2018 were genetically 
engineered to resist both GBHs and dicamba, and around 
two-thirds of national acreage will likely be sprayed in 
2019 with this same mixture of herbicides [46, 47].
Currently the National Toxicology Program is conduct-
ing in vitro assays comparing the genotoxicity of glypho-
sate technical and several glyphosate formulations, as 
well as conducting a comprehensive literature review of 
the current database on glyphosate genotoxicity. Their 
full report has not been published, but a poster presented 
at the 2018 Society of Toxicology Conference reported 
the results of several assays on human HepaRG and 
HeCaT cell lines [41]. CellTiter-Glo, ROS-Glo, and JC10 
assays on both cell lines revealed significant impacts on 
cell viability and alteration of mitochondrial membrane 
potential for both glyphosate and glyphosate-based for-
mulations. In addition, GBHs were substantially more 
toxic than glyphosate alone. The glyphosate formulations 
studied decreased cell viability by more than 90% at con-
centrations “approximately 20- to 50-fold lower than 
glyphosate” [41].
Debate likely to persist
The scientific debate over the genotoxicity and oncogenic 
potential of GBHs is ongoing. While both the EPA and 
EFSA consider the glyphosate database to be essentially 
complete relative to current testing requirements, critical 
knowledge and data gaps persist in three areas: (1) well-
designed 2-year feeding studies in mice and rats fed for-
mulated GBHs; (2) data on occupational exposures and 
risk under a diversity of scenarios, including atypical but 
recurrent handling and application scenarios that lead to 
markedly elevated exposures; and (3) modern, rigorous 
data on the rate of skin penetration of the glyphosate and 
co-formulants in GBHs, in contrast to rates of penetra-
tion from studies conducted using technical glyphosate. 
Ideally, to build confidence in study results, each of the 
above sets of studies should be undertaken both by reg-
istrants in accord with testing guidance from regulators, 
and by scientists not affiliated with, or funded by pesti-
cide registrants or their allied organizations.
Conclusions
According to EPA, glyphosate technical does not pose 
oncogenic risk at “relevant” levels of exposure, i.e. those 
levels likely to occur among members of the general 
public from “typical” dietary exposures. In reaching 
its “not likely to be oncogenic” conclusion, the EPA (1) 
largely ignored epidemiological studies, some of which 
reported elevated, statistically significant odds ratios 
among cohorts that were relatively more highly exposed 
to GBHs and, (2) placed little or no weight on multiple 
in vivo GBH genotoxicity assays that reported DNA dam-
age and/or oxidative stress in laboratory animals and 
exposed human cohorts.
IARC, on the other hand, placed considerable weight 
on studies linking use of, and exposure to GBHs to can-
cer, as well as evidence of DNA damage and oxidative 
stress in human populations exposed to GBHs. The sci-
ence base reviewed by IARC included adverse impacts 
among some people much more heavily exposed than 
a typical person in the US or Europe. Hence, the IARC 
Working Group’s weight-of-evidence judgement that 
GBHs are “probably carcinogenic to humans” is most 
appropriately applied to those humans who are relatively 
more heavily exposed to GBHs. In fact, had the IARC 
Working Group restricted its assessment of GBH onco-
genicity in ways comparable to the limits embedded in 
the assessments conducted by the EPA and EFSA, it is

likely that the IARC Working Group would not have clas-
sified glyphosate as Group 2A, “probably carcinogenic to 
humans.
”
Ongoing research, regulatory risk assessments, and 
debate over glyphosate and GBH carcinogenicity and 
genotoxicity should be focused on studies relevant to the 
biological impacts triggered by exposures to widely used, 
formulated GBHs.
The laws and policies governing EPA regulatory deci-
sion-making direct the agency to carefully assess expo-
sures and typical, expected risks to the general public and 
environment from pesticide applications made in accord 
with label directions and required safety precautions. 
Much less effort has been invested by EPA in assuring 
that occupational and worker-risk assessments are based 
on accurate exposure and toxicological data. Such scenar-
ios should include when, where, how, and how frequently 
and heavily a formulated GBH is applied by a given per-
son. Risk assessments, pesticide label directions, pesti-
cide applicator training and certification curricula, and 
health-related warnings to applicators should address 
scenarios when hoses leak, spills occur, the wind blows 
in unexpected ways, clothes are drenched and need to be 
handled safely, and other unusual circumstances leading 
to higher-than-normal exposures.
While unusually high-exposure scenarios generally 
arise from some combination of equipment malfunction, 
operator error or carelessness, or working in or near a 
recently treated field or area, the frequency of such epi-
sodes is a function of the diversity and number of appli-
cations made. In the case of glyphosate-based herbicides, 
the world’s most widely used pesticide ever, such rela-
tively high-exposure episodes occur tens of thousands of 
times on a daily basis in the US and hundreds of thou-
sands, if not millions of times globally.
IARC’s evaluation relied heavily on studies capable of 
shedding light on the distribution of real-world expo-
sures and genotoxicity risk in exposed human popula-
tions, while EPA’s evaluation placed little or no weight on 
such evidence.

Competing interests
CB has served since September 2016 as an expert witness for plaintiffs in US 
litigation involving the impact of glyphosate-based herbicides on non-Hodg-
kin lymphoma. His work as an expert witness has included assessment of the 
genotoxicity databases relied upon by the EPA and IARC in their evaluations 
of GBH carcinogenicity. Lawyers involved in the litigation had no role in the 
decision to write this paper, nor in reviewing or commenting on its content. In 
the past, CB has also served as an expert witness in litigation focused on 
whether foods containing ingredients from genetically-engineered crops can 
be labeled “natural” without misleading consumers. His work since 1981 on 
pesticide use, risks, and regulation has been supported by state and federal 
agencies, the US Congress, the US National Academy of Sciences, foundations, 
NGOs, pesticide manufacturers, and the food industry, including organic food 
and farming companies and organizations.
