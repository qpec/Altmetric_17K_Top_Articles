Green tea-derived polyphenol (�)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has been extensively studied for its
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in models of inflammatory bowel disease, yet the underlying
molecular mechanism is not completely understood. Herein, we demonstrate that EGCG can potently inhibit
the proinflammatory enzyme myeloperoxidase in vitro in a dose-dependent manner over a range of
physiologic temperatures and pH values. The ability of EGCG to mediate its inhibitory activity is counter-
regulated by the presence of iron and lipocalin 2. Spectral analysis indicated that EGCG prevents the
peroxidase-catalyzed reaction by reverting the reactive peroxidase heme (compound I:oxoiron) back to its
native inactive ferric state, possibly via the exchange of electrons. Further, administration of EGCG to
dextran sodium sulfateeinduced colitic mice significantly reduced the colonic myeloperoxidase activity and
alleviated proinflammatory mediators associated with gut inflammation. However, the efficacy of EGCG
against gut inflammation is diminished when orally coadministered with iron. These findings indicate that
the ability of EGCG to inhibit myeloperoxidase activity is one of the mechanisms by which it exerts
mucoprotective effects and that counter-regulatory factors such as dietary iron and luminal lipocalin 2
should be taken into consideration for optimizing clinical management strategies for inflammatory bowel
disease with the use of EGCG treatment. (Am J Pathol 2016, 186: 912e926; http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/

Green tea (Camellia sinensis, Theaceae) contains a plethora of
antioxidant polyphenols that may promote better health.1
Among
those
polyphenols,
the
four
major
catechins
(�)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), (�)-epigallocatechin,
(�)-epicatechin-3-gallate, and (�)-epicatechin are the most
widely studied for their potential therapeutic properties. Indeed,
EGCG, which accounts for about 40% of total polyphenol
content in green tea, was reported to have preventive and ther-
apeutic properties against a spectrum of diseases that include
metabolic syndrome,2 inflammatory bowel diseases,3 infectious
diseases,4 neurologic disease,5 and cancers.6e10
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn
disease and ulcerative colitis, currently affect approximately
1.5 million individuals in the United States and 2.2 million
individuals in Europe.11 In IBD, persistent elevated concen-
trations of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1b, IL-6,
IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), cause neutrophils to
continue infiltrating the intestinal mucosa, resulting in IBD
flares and tissue damage.12 EGCG was shown to protect

 against weight loss, reduce histologic damage, and increase
survival in the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced acute
murine colitis model.13 Likewise, long-term oral administra-
tion of EGCG was shown to reduce proinflammatory cyto-
kines such as TNF, interferon g, and IL-6 in the colonic
mucosa of DSS-induced colitic mice.3 However, the molecular
mechanisms by which EGCG protects against gut inflamma-
tion are not completely elucidated.
Neutrophils, the most abundant circulating white blood
cells, are the first responder cell type during inflammation,
infection, and injury. These cells infiltrate the intestinal
mucosa to reach the site of insult, subsequently undergo
respiratory burst, and release myeloperoxidase (MPO;
E.C.1.11.2.2). MPO is a heme-containing enzyme that uses
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and halide ions to generate
hypohalous acid, a potent oxidizing and antimicrobial
agent.14 MPO is located within the neutrophils with the
siderophore-binding innate immune protein called lipocalin
2 [(Lcn2; alias neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin
(NGAL)]. As part of the host response to inflammation,
Lcn2 is released by both immune cells and intestinal
epithelia,15 serving both as an epithelial growth factor16 and
a chelator of bacterial siderophores, specifically enterobactin
(Ent) with a high affinity (0.4 nmol/L).17 Thus, Lcn2 can
deprive bacteria of iron and prevent their proliferation.
Recently, we demonstrated that Ent is a potent inhibitor of
MPO but loses its inhibitory properties when bound to
Lcn2.18 Similar to Ent, EGCG was shown to reduce MPO
activity in vitro19 and to form complexes with iron and Lcn2
in vitro.20 However, a detailed mechanism of EGCG-
mediated MPO inhibition, the extent to which iron- and
host-derived Lcn2 influence EGCG bioactivity, and the
in vivo functionality of these in vitro observations remain
unknown.
Iron is an essential trace metal that is required by both the
host and the gut microbiota for their biological functions.
Most circulating iron in the host are bound to proteins,
although a small fraction remains unbound and is regarded
as the labile or catalytic iron.21 These unbound iron mole-
cules are highly reactive and readily participate in Fenton
reaction in which free ferrous iron (Fe2þ) react with H2O2 to
produce ferric iron (Fe3þ).22 Fe3þ then reacts with H2O2 in
the Haber-Weiss reaction to generate hydroxyl radicals and
Fe2þ that again participate in the redox cycle.23 The
resulting cyclical overproduction of free radicals leads to
increasing oxidative stress and damage, which contribute to
disease such as IBD. Indeed, iron supplementation was
shown to aggravate inflammation in murine models of
colitis.24,25 Although EGCG was previously shown to be
capable of binding and reducing Fe3þ to Fe2þ,20 the effect
of iron on the efficacy of EGCG in treating IBD remains
unexplored.
In this study, we report the potent inhibitory property of
EGCG on two similar heme-containing peroxidases, MPO
and lactoperoxidase (LPO; EC: 1.11.1.7)26 in vitro and
provide evidence to demonstrate that EGCG also inhibits
MPO activity in vivo in the inflamed gut. The inhibitory
properties of EGCG are abrogated in the presence of iron
and/or when EGCG complexes with murine Lcn2 or its
human ortholog NGAL. Spectral analysis with the use of
LPO-H2O2 as a model system revealed that EGCG pre-
vented the peroxidase-catalyzed reaction, suggesting that its
antioxidative properties may be the underlying mechanism
of EGCG-mediated MPO/LPO inhibition. Collectively, our
study documents a novel in vivo mechanism for the pro-
tective bioactivity of EGCG during intestinal inflammation
as being, at least in part, because of the inhibition of MPO, a
process that is counter-regulated by iron and Lcn2.
Materials and Methods
Reagents
Human MPO, human NGAL, and murine Lcn2 were procured
from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). EGCG was obtained
from two sources: Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and Taiyo
Green Power (Jiangsu, China). Ferric chloride, H2O2, and
4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (ABAH; a known inhibitor of
MPO27,28) were procured from Sigma-Aldrich. Bovine milk
LPO was purchased from Worthington Biochemical Corp
(Lakewood, NJ). Guaiacol (2-methoxyphenol) and ascorbic
acid were obtained from Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA). Reagent
grade DSS (mol. wt. Z 36,000e50,000; lot no. M8667) was
obtained from MP Biomedicals, LLC (Solon, OH). Bleomycin
sulfate was procured from Biotang (Lexington, MA). K12
Escherichia coli strain was acquired from The E. coli Genetic
Stock Center, Yale University (New Haven, CT).
Mice
C57BL/6J mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory
(Bar Harbor, ME) and bred in-house in the animal facility at
The Pennsylvania State University. All animal experiments
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at The Pennsylvania State University.
MPO and LPO in Vitro Assay
Human MPO and bovine milk LPO were reconstituted with
0.1 mol/L potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and stored
at �80�C. MPO (12.5 mg/mL, final concentration) or LPO
(25 mg/mL, final concentration) were preincubated with
various concentrations of EGCG with or without iron or
Lcn2/NGAL for 5 minutes at room temperature in 20-mL
reaction volume. The reaction was initiated on the addition
of 30 mL of 2.2 mmol/L H2O2 and 50 mL of 100 mmol/L
guaiacol. This assay is based on the principle that peroxi-
dase oxidizes guaiacol in the presence of H2O2 to a chro-
mophore
3,30-dimethoxy-4,40-biphenylquinone.29
The
change in absorbance at 470 nm was measured at 1-minute
intervals over a period of 10 minutes. The reactions were
performed in 96-well plates (Corning, Corning, NY) in

 triplicate with appropriate vehicles throughout the study at
pH 6.0 and 25�C. One unit of MPO or LPO activity is
defined as the amount that increases absorbance at 470 nm
by one per minute at 25�C, calculated from the initial rate
of reaction with the use of guaiacol as the substrate. The
final concentrations of MPO and LPO used were deter-
mined to be equivalent to 0.20 to 0.25 unit of activity.
In Vitro Bacterial Killing Assay
In vitro bacterial killing assay was performed as described by
Atosuo and Lilius.30 Briefly, the MPO reaction mixture was
prepared by first adding 5 mg/mL MPO with or without EGCG
at various concentrations in sterile phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS). The concentration of chloride ion in PBS is estimated to
be approximately 0.138 mol/L, which serves as the substrate
required by MPO for the generation of hypohalous acid.
Hydrogen peroxide (30 mmol/L) was then added to the reaction
mixture and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes.
Finally, E. coli (K12 strain) grown overnight in Lysogeny broth
media at 37�C with shaking at 250 rpm were added to the re-
action mixture (2.0 � 106 colony-forming unit per mL). After
30 minutes of incubation at room temperature, the reaction
mixture was serially diluted and plated on nonselective
Lysogeny broth agar plates in triplicates. Plates were incubated
overnight at 37�C, and bacterial colony-forming units on plates
were quantified. All indicated concentrations above represent
final system concentrations.
Spectral Analysis
LPO (1 mg/mL) was reconstituted in 500 mL of 0.1 mol/L
phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and incubated with either vehicle,
50 mmol/L EGCG, or 50 mmol/L ABAH for 5 minutes. The
reaction was initiated at room temperature on the addition of
30 mmol/L H2O2. Spectra at 250 to 500 nm were recorded
every 10 seconds with the use of CARY50BIO UV-Visible
Spectrophotometer. Each spectrum represents an average of
six scans taken in 1 second. All indicated concentrations
above represent final system concentrations.
CAS Assay
Chrome Azurol S (CAS) agar plates were prepared according
to protocol outlined by Schwyn and Neilands.31 CAS remains
blue in color when complexed with iron but turns orange when
iron is chelated by iron chelators/siderophores. Briefly, 1 mL of
EGCG mixed with or without ferric chloride at indicated
concentrations were placed on CAS plate and monitored for
orange halo formation. Aferric Ent (Sigma-Aldrich) was used
as a positive control.
Fe2þ-Dependent Bleomycin-Induced DNA Damage Assay
The bleomycin assay was performed as outlined by Burkitt
et al32 with the following modifications. EGCG (1 mmol/L)
or ascorbic acid (1 mmol/L) was added to a mixture that
contained calf 50 mg/mL thymus DNA (Sigma-Aldrich),
50 mU/mL bleomycin sulfate, 0.1 mol/L Tris/HCl (Sigma-
Aldrich), 5 mmol/L MgCl2$6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) in water
treated with Chelex 100 (Sigma-Aldrich). The reaction was
initiated by adding the mixture to a series of Fe3þ concen-
trations prepared in 96-well solid black plate (Corning). For
control, the mixture was prepared as above but without
Fe3þ. After incubation at 37�C for 1 hour, the reaction was
stopped by adding 0.1 mmol/L EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich). The
fluorescent DNA-intercalating agent ethidium bromide (0.1
mmol/L;
Sigma-Aldrich)
was
added
to
the
mixture.
Fluorescence readings were then taken (excitation 510 nm;
emission 590 nm). In principle, the conversion of Fe3þ to
Fe2þ is detected as bleomycin-induced DNA damage that is
proportional to the amount of available Fe2þ. Damage to DNA
corresponds to the loss in the ethidium bromideeenhanced
fluorescent signal. Therefore, the percentage of DNA damage
was calculated by comparing the ethidium bromideeenhanced
fluorescence readings from the sample group with the control
group. All indicated concentrations above represent final sys-
tem concentrations.
DSS-Induced Colitis in Mice
In experiment 1, 8-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (n Z 4)
were administered 1.6% DSS in drinking water over a
period of 7 days. The induction of colonic inflammation was
confirmed via fecal occult blood, diarrhea, and loss in body
weight. On day 6, mice were treated with 25 or 50 mg
EGCG/kg body weight by oral gavage. On day 7, mice were
given similar doses of EGCG and euthanized 3 hours later
via carbon dioxide asphyxiation.
In experiment 2, 8-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (n Z 4)
were treated with 1.6% DSS (in drinking water), and 5 mg
EGCG/kg body weight by oral gavage once daily for 7 days.
Mice were euthanized 3 hours after the last dose of EGCG.
In experiment 3, 8-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (n Z 4)
were administered DSS as described above and then treated
with
either
50
mg
EGCG/kg
body
weight
alone
or
EGCG þ iron [EGCG (50 mg/kg body weight) coadminis-
tered with iron in a molar ratio of 1:6] on day 6 and day 7 (24
and 3 hours before euthanasia, respectively).
In all experiments, mice in the control groups received
only regular drinking water (without DSS) and given PBS
(vehicle) oral gavage. Blood samples were collected at the
time of euthanasia in a BD microtainer (Becton Dickinson,
Franklin Lakes, NJ), via retro-orbital plexus. Hemolysis-free
serum samples were obtained after centrifugation and stored
at �80�C until further use. Colons were flushed gently with
PBS to remove fecal matter, weighed, and collected for
MPO assay. Briefly, colons were homogenized in 0.5%
cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide in potassium buffer (pH
6.0), freeze-thawed three times, sonicated, and centri-
fuged.33 Clear supernatant fluids were collected and used for
MPO assay as described above.

 Cytokine Assays
Fecal Lcn2, serum Lcn2, and serum keratinocyte-derived che-
mokine CXCL1 (KC) were measured by duoset enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay kits from R&D Systems according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.34
Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR
Mouse distal colons were collected in RNAlater (Sigma-
Aldrich) and stored at �80�C. RNA was extracted from colon
tissue with the use of Trizol reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) as
described in the manufacturer’s protocol. DSS is known to
interfere with PCR reactions; therefore, we purified RNA with
the use of the lithium chloride procedure as described in
Viennois et al.35 Purified RNA (0.5 mg) was used to synthesize
cDNA for quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) with the
use of SYBR green (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The following
primers were used to assess gene expression: KC34 forward,

36B4 was used to normalize relative mRNA expression with
the use of 2DDCT method. Fold change was determined by
comparison with the untreated control group.
Histology and Immunohistochemistry
After euthanasia, Swiss rolls of colons were fixed overnight
in 10% buffered formalin solution and stored in 70% ethanol.
Colons were processed for paraffin embedding, and serial
paraffin sections (5 mm) were collected and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin. For neutrophil staining, the paraffin-
embedded colon sections were stained with rat anti-mouse
antibody specific to neutrophil marker Ly6G (NIMP-R14;
Abcam, Cambridge, UK) with the use of a diaminobenzidine
peroxidase substrate kit from Vector Laboratories (Burlin-
game, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. An
appropriate negative isotype control (rat IgG2b; Abcam) was
included to omit nonspecific staining. To estimate neutrophil
infiltration into the colonic mucosa, at least four images (size:
2592p � 1944p) of NIMP-R14estained tissue were obtained

 at �100 magnification. The images were analyzed with the
use of ImageJ software version 1.49 (NIH, Bethesda, MD;
http://imagej.nih.gov/ij), and a scale of 5 pixels/mm was set
on the basis of the image legend. The mucosa layer was
defined as the area between the muscularis mucosae and the
luminal surface of the colon. DiaminobenzidineeNIMP-R14
positive-stained cells were counted and expressed as
neutrophils/mm.2 Histologic scoring on hematoxylin and
eosinestained colon sections was performed as in Cooper
et al.37 Briefly, colonic inflammation was graded for intes-
tinal lesions, inflammation, mucosa, and percentage of
affected area in the scale of 0 to 4, corresponding to the
degree of increasing severity.
Statistical Analysis
All in vitro experimental results were reproduced in at least
three independent experiments performed in triplicates. The
in vivo mice experiments were individual studies with
sample size of 4 mice. All values in the results are expressed
as means � SEM. The significance of difference between
different groups was determined by one-way analysis of
variance, followed by post hoc Sidak/Dunnet multiple
comparison test in case of three or more groups and un-
paired Student t-test in case of two groups. P < 0.05 was
considered as significant. GraphPad Prism version 6.0
(GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) was used to
calculate statistical significance.
Results
EGCG Inhibits Heme Peroxidases in a Dose-Dependent
Fashion
EGCG was previously demonstrated to exhibit antioxidant
and anti-inflammatory properties,1 although the exact
mechanisms underlying such properties are not clearly
understood. In this study, we tested whether ECGC could
affect the bioactivity of neutrophil MPO, a pro-oxidant
enzyme associated with acute inflammation. ABAH,
which is a known MPO inhibitor,27,28 was used as the
positive control. EGCG inhibited MPO activity in vitro in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 1A). EGCG also dose
dependently inhibited the activity of LPO (Figure 1B), a
heme-containing peroxidase with properties similar to
MPO.26 In addition, EGCG mediated its inhibition on
Figure 2
Ferric iron-bound EGCG loses its ability to inhibit MPO and LPO activity. A: EGCG was preincubated with or without Fe3þ at indicated molar ratio
and then 1 mL of the mixture was placed on CAS plate. Formation of orange halo indicates that EGCG chelated the iron from the CAS plate. Ent and FeCl3 were
used as positive and negative control, respectively. In the bleomycin-detectable Fe2þ assay, EGCG or ascorbic acid (positive control) was incubated with
indicated doses of Fe3þ in the reaction mixture for 1 hour at 37�C. B: Line graphs represent the conversion of Fe3þ to Fe2þ, which was quantitated as Fe2þ-
dependent bleomycin-induced DNA damage. C and D: Bar graphs represent inhibition of MPO (C) and LPO (D) activity by 50 mmol/L EGCG that was pre-
incubated with Fe3þ for 5 minutes at the indicated molar ratio before the assay was initiated. Results are expressed as means � SEM. Assays were performed in
a 96-well plate in triplicates and are representative of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05. CAS, chrome Azurol S; EGCG, (�)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate;

 MPO activity even after the MPO reaction was initiated
(Figure 1C). The ability of EGCG to inhibit MPO and LPO
activity was observed over a range of physiologically
relevant pH (5.0 to 7.4; data not shown) and temperatures
(25 to 40�C; data not shown).
The end product of MPO-catalyzed reaction, hypohalous
acid, acts as a potent antibacterial agent by halogenating
bacterial cell membrane components. To confirm that
EGCG-mediated inhibition could reduce the generation of
hypohalous acid by MPO, we measured the viability of K12
E. coli exposed to MPO þ H2O2 in the presence or absence
of EGCG. Our study found that EGCG dose dependently
reduced MPO þ H2O2-mediated bacterial killing compared
with the control (Figure 1D), suggesting that EGCG could
prevent cellular damage induced by MPO and its end
products.
Fe3þ-Bound EGCG Fails to Inhibit Heme Peroxidase
Activity
Because EGCG is known to chelate iron,38 we next asked
whether the presence of iron could affect the ability of
EGCG to inhibit MPO and LPO. First, we tested whether
the EGCG used in this study is iron free and could bind to
iron. EGCG chelated iron from CAS plate which resulted
in a distinct orange halo formation (Figure 2A). Ent was
used as a positive control. We conducted this experiment
with EGCG procured from two different sources, and the
results were consistent (data not shown), confirming that
the EGCG used in this study is iron free. However, this
halo-forming effect was lost in the presence of increasing
concentrations of ferric iron (Figure 2A). When EGCG
was mixed with high concentration of ferric iron, we
observed the presence of a black-colored precipitate in the
solution and also on the CAS plate, suggesting that EGCG
is capable of reacting with iron and likely converts Fe3þ
to Fe2þ iron.39 To ascertain this possibility, we performed
a modified bleomycin-detectable iron assay to evaluate
the redox reactions of EGCG with iron. Ascorbic acid, as
a reducing agent and a positive control, reduces ferric iron
and induces oxidative DNA damage even at a low iron
concentration. Compared with ascorbic acid, EGCG
catalyzed the conversion of Fe3þ to Fe2þ only in the
presence of higher Fe3þ concentration, beginning with the
molar ratio EGCG:Fe3þ of 1:1 (Figure 2B). More
importantly, the presence of EGCG:Fe3þ in the molar
ratio of 1:5 and 1:10 significantly mitigated the ability of
EGCG to inhibit MPO and LPO activity (Figure 2, C and
D), which highlight ferric iron as a potential counter-
regulator of EGCG function.

 Innate Immune Protein Lcn2 Prevents EGCG from
Inhibiting Heme Peroxidases Activity
One of the well-established functions of Lcn2 is to
chelate the bacterial siderophore Ent, which is rich in
phenolic groups.17 Because both MPO and Lcn2 are
present in the neutrophils and are robustly expressed
during intestinal inflammation,34 we next asked whether
Lcn2/NGAL can influence EGCG-mediated inhibition of
MPO and LPO, especially because EGCG is also rich in
phenolic groups. Human NGAL prevented EGCG from
inhibiting MPO and LPO activity in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 3, A and B). Similar results were
observed when the experiments were performed with
Lcn2, which is the murine ortholog of the human NGAL
(Figure 3, C and D).
EGCG Inactivates Heme Peroxidase-Catalyzed Reaction
To
elucidate
the
underlying
mechanism
of
EGCG-
mediated MPO/LPO inhibition, we performed spectral
analysis of LPO-catalyzed reaction with H2O2 in the
presence or absence of EGCG. Because of technical limi-
tation and unavailability of MPO supplied at the amount
required for experiments with spectral analysis, we there-
fore used LPO as our model system. Spectral analysis of
LPO alone showed a lmax of 412 nm (Figure 4A), which is
characteristic for the heme moiety in the enzyme.40 The
addition of EGCG or ABAH (positive control; known in-
hibitor of LPO and MPO27,28) to LPO did not induce any
change in the lmax, suggesting that EGCG and ABAH do
not directly associate with the heme moiety of LPO or
chelate heme Fe3þ (Figure 4, B and C). On the addition of
H2O2 to LPO, the heme iron [Fe(III)] in LPO reacts with
H2O2 to produce the LPO redox intermediate oxoiron
[Fe(IV)þO] that has a lmax of 430 nm (Figure 4D).
However, when H2O2 was added to LPO preincubated
with EGCG, the lmax initially shifted from 412 nm to 430
nm, but then immediately reverted back to 412 nm
(Figure 4E) in a fashion that is similar to that observed
when ABAH was used instead of EGCG (Figure 4F). This
suggests that the antioxidant EGCG is able to revert the
redox reaction and to restore the native Fe(III) state to the
heme of LPO, without directly interfering with the heme
moiety of the peroxidase. After spectral analysis, we
collected the reaction mixture and confirmed that the LPO
incubated with EGCG is completely inactivated via LPO
assay described previously (data not shown).

50 mmol/L EGCG or 50 mmol/L ABAH for 5 minutes. Reaction was initiated at room temperature by adding 30 mmol/L H2O2. Spectra were recorded at 250 to
500 nm with each spectrum representing an average of six scans taken in 1.0 second. AeF: Image represents LPO alone (A), LPO þ EGCG (B), LPO þ ABAH (C),

 EGCG Inhibits MPO Activity in the Inflamed Gut of
Colitic Mice
We tested whether the EGCG-mediated inhibition of MPO
in vitro could be replicated in the DSS-induced murine model
of colitis. Treatment with EGCG (25 or 50 mg/kg body
weight) dose dependently reduced colonic MPO activity
compared with DSS-only control (Figure 5A). However, it is
possible that the observed decrease in colonic MPO activity
could be due to decreased neutrophil infiltration, secondary
to other anti-inflammatory effects of EGCG. Hence, we
examined the differences in neutrophil infiltration by
immunohistochemistry.
Although
DSS-only
treatment
increased neutrophil infiltration compared with control,
EGCG treatments did not significantly mitigate those effects
(Figure 5, B and D) compared with the DSS-only treatment,
demonstrating that the observed reduced colonic MPO ac-
tivity was attributable to inhibition by EGCG and not due to
changes in neutrophil infiltration. In this experiment, how-
ever, oral administration of only two doses of EGCG (24 and
3 hours before euthanasia) did not result in observable
improvement in the inflamed colon histology (Figure 5C).

 Hence, we tested whether EGCG, also an iron chelator,
would affect the basal expression of inflammatory markers
in the gut of healthy mice. We orally administered 50 mg
EGCG/kg body weight to 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice
at 24 and 3 hours before euthanasia and then cultured colon
sections ex vivo in incomplete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium for 24 hours. However, we observed no difference
in the levels of secreted Lcn2 and KC (murine homolog of
human IL-8) in the culture media when comparing the un-
treated and EGCG-treated group (data not shown), indi-
cating that EGCG treatment does not affect basal expression
of inflammatory markers in healthy mice.
Having established that EGCG could inhibit MPO ac-
tivity in vivo, we next asked whether EGCG can attenuate
intestinal inflammation as well. Although treatment with
daily doses of 5 mg EGCG/kg body weight for 7 days did
not prevent weight loss in colitic mice (Figure 6A); the
treatment prevented splenomegaly and colon shortening that
are associated with DSS-induced colitis (Figure 6, BeD).
These mice displayed a less severe colitis as reflected by the
significantly reduced levels of colonic MPO activity, serum
KC, serum Lcn2, and fecal Lcn2 (Figure 6, EeH), all of
which are sensitive markers of intestinal inflammation.34
Further, the colonic expression for proinflammatory genes
that encode KC, Lcn2, nitric oxide synthase 2, and TNF
were significantly reduced in EGCG-treated colitic mice
(Figure 6, IeL). However, we did not observe significant
histologic changes between colon of DSS-only and EGCG-
treated group (Figure 6, M and N).

 recapitulated in vivo by treating DSS-induced colitic mice
with either vehicle, 50 mg/kg body weight EGCG alone,
or EGCG þ iron in 1:6 molar ratio on day 6 and day 7 of
DSS treatment. Consistent with our earlier observations,
mice receiving EGCG-alone treatment exhibited loss in
body weight (Figure 7A) but displayed a substantial
alleviation of gut inflammation with protection against
splenomegaly and colon shortening (Figure 7, BeD)
compared with DSS control, EGCG þ iron, and the iron-
alone treated groups. Notably, the ability of EGCG to
reduce colonic MPO activity was abrogated when EGCG
was coadministered with iron (Figure 7, E and F). In
addition, only the EGCG-alone group exhibited reduced
levels of serum KC, serum Lcn2, fecal Lcn2, and reduced
colonic expression of proinflammatory genes (encoding
KC, Lcn2, and TNF), but this was not observed in the
EGCG þ iron group, which further confirmed that the
presence of iron could counter-regulate the efficacy of
EGCG treatment (Figure 7, GeL). However, we again did
not observe EGCG-mediated amelioration of colitis at the

Discussion
Elevated levels of proinflammatory mediators and oxida-
tive stress play a key role in the pathology of IBD.
Numerous naturally occurring plant-derived polyphenols
were shown to alleviate gut inflammation in IBD patients
and animal models of colitis.42 One such plant-derived
compound, EGCG, has been widely studied for its
possible anticolitogenic and antioxidant properties. Even
though EGCG was shown to negatively affect MPO ac-
tivity in vitro,19 its molecular mechanism of gut protection
in vivo was not clearly elucidated. Herein, we demonstrate
that EGCG potently inhibits MPO activity in a dose-
dependent manner at physiologic pH and temperatures
in vitro and also in vivo in the inflamed gut. Because of its
ability to bind iron, we expected EGCG to be capable of
chelating iron from the heme moiety of MPO and LPO, but
this was not the case. Contrary to our initial hypothesis,
EGCG mediates its antioxidant effect without directly
interfering with the heme moiety of the peroxidase.
Spectral analysis on EGCG-mediated inhibition of LPO, a
heme-containing enzyme that has similar function to MPO,
reveals that EGCG reverts the peroxidase radical inter-
mediate oxoiron back to its native inactive state, possibly
by donating electrons to oxoiron. Oxoiron is required to
react with halide ion to generate hypohalous acid.40 The
reactivity of hypohalous acid to heme iron (including those
in MPO) was shown to induce heme degradation and the
release of free or reactive iron,43,44 leading to a cascade of
free radical generation. In lieu of this, the inactivation of
oxoiron by EGCG would effectively negate the production
of hypohalous acid by MPO and LPO. By limiting MPO
activity, EGCG could play a role in preventing collateral
tissue damage by hypohalous acid during acute intestinal
inflammation.
The beneficial effects of EGCG in treating gut inflam-
mation were demonstrated in mouse models of colitis. In
one study, EGCG-enriched diet was shown to induce down-
regulation of inflammation-associated genes such as IL1B,
TNFA, interferon g gene, Toll-like receptor 2 gene, and
CD14 in spontaneously colitic Mdr1a�/� mice.45 It is
thought that EGCG mediates its therapeutic effects by
modulating gene expression via inhibition of various
transcription factors, including NF-kB, Sp1, activating
protein-1, STAT1, STAT3, and forkhead box O1.46e53 Aside
from this, EGCG not only inhibits NADPH oxidase,54 which
produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), but also scavenges
ROS and reduces oxidative stress.55,56 ROS is one of the
main factors that contribute to IBD pathology, and its
elimination by EGCG may alleviate gut inflammation.
Hence, the ability of EGCG to inhibit MPO and other
neutrophils’ pro-oxidant enzymes could provide an addi-
tional layer of protection, which perhaps could be one of the
primary effects of EGCG that leads to the secondary down-
regulation of downstream proinflammatory responses.57
Interestingly, EGCG is also demonstrated to inhibit
neutrophil elastase and to impair the migration of neutro-
phils in response to the chemoattractant IL-8.58,59 However,
we did not observe a difference in the amount of neutrophils
in the mucosa between the untreated and EGCG-treated
colitic mice, despite the apparent reduction of colonic
MPO activity in the latter. It is likely that the neutrophils
were already present in mucosa before EGCG treatment or
that the dosage of EGCG that we used in this study was
insufficient to induce observable reduction in neutrophil
infiltration. In addition, the low EGCG doses used in this
study may also explain the lesser degree of protection
against colitis compared with previous reports that used
higher doses of EGCG.3,13,46,60 Regardless, the effective-
ness of EGCG in treating IBD was shown to be comparable
with the widely used anti-colitogenic drug sulfasalazine in
the murine model of DSS-induced colitis.3 Indeed, the
Figure 8
Potential mechanism by which EGCG mediates antioxidant
effects that could alleviate gut inflammation. During inflammation,
neutrophils release a plethora of pro-oxidant enzymes; one such enzyme
is MPO whose bioactivity is associated with flares of inflammatory bowel
disease. EGCG potently inhibits the activity of MPO and therefore reduces
the level of oxidative stress in the inflamed gut. However, the beneficial
MPO inhibition by EGCG is counter-regulated by iron and host Lcn2/
NGAL. Altogether, the present study unravels the complex regulation
of EGCG on MPO activity and its counter-regulation by iron and host
Lcn2/NGAL. EGCG, (�)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate; Fe3þ, ferric iron;

 potential use of EGCG to treat gut inflammation and other
diseases has garnered a great deal of attention, leading to its
current inclusion in human clinical studies.61
The efficacy of EGCG in human clinical trials remains
somewhat inconclusive because EGCG treatments were
found to aggravate gut inflammation rather than to alleviate
the disease in several cases.61 Although it is not completely
understood, many studies implicate that this could be due to
the pro-oxidant properties of EGCG in the presence of
Fe3þ.62e65 EGCG was previously shown to form complexes
with Fe3þ and to participate in the Fenton reaction.20 The
reduction of Fe3þ to Fe2þ accelerates the formation free
hydroxyl radicals and ROS that are detrimental to the gut.
Interestingly, high doses of EGCG were shown to induce
Fenton reaction and to generate more ROS, whereas low
doses of EGCG scavenges ROS in vitro.66 Accordingly,
several animal studies also demonstrated that high doses of
dietary EGCG tend to induce a pro-oxidative response that
aggravates gut inflammation in vivo.61,67e69 Although we
did not observe the purported detrimental effects of EGCG
in this study, our in vitro findings do demonstrate that iron at
1:1 molar ratio induces EGCG to switch from being an
antioxidant into one that is pro-oxidant. In addition, the
presence of excess/dysregulated iron can counter the bene-
ficial effect of EGCG by additionally abrogating its ability
to inhibit MPO and LPO activity. This suggests that the
presence of iron-rich conditions could potentially alter
EGCG bioactivity and may shift it from being an inhibitor
of MPO into a harmful pro-oxidant. Hence, the consumption
of diets rich in iron or oral iron supplements to treat iron
deficiency-induced anemia in IBD at the same time as
EGCG administration may be detrimental.
Iron is an essential nutrient to most bacteria, excluding
Lactobacillus and Borrelia species.70e72 The hypoferremic
conditions induced by acute inflammation in the gut may
allow growth of bacteria that could better adapt to iron-poor
conditions. The ability of EGCG to bind Fe3þ and its
reduction to Fe2þ may have substantial influence over
bacterial iron acquisition because bacterial siderophores
have high affinity specific to Fe3þ but not Fe2þ. In addition,
EGCG can prevent Enterococcus faecalis biofilm forma-
tion73 via EGCG-Fe2þ mediated hydroxyl radical formation.
Further, the chelation of EGCG þ Fe3þ binary complex by
host antibacterial innate immune protein NGAL/Lcn2 may
add another layer of complexity to the acquisition of iron by
resident bacteria in the inflamed gut. However, the iron-
binding and oxidative properties of EGCG may be benefi-
cial in exerting antibacterial pressure in the inflamed gut and
perhaps play a role in alleviating disease by modulating
gut bacteria composition and growth. Yet, this may also
result in a rapid decrease in beneficial bacteria and over-
growth of opportunistic pathogens (eg, E. coli), which can
express
Lcn2/NGAL-resistant
stealth
siderophores.74
Further studies are warranted, given our current limited
knowledge on the interplay between EGCG and gut
microbiota in the inflamed gut.
A study by Barasch and colleagues20 demonstrated that
NGAL could form a stable complex with iron-bound
EGCG and could suppress its pro-oxidant properties
in vitro, highlighting the first molecule of plant origin to
form complexes with NGAL. Although the presence of
NGAL may be beneficial in preventing the adverse pro-
oxidative effect of EGCG, the EGCG sequestration by
NGAL could also eliminate its therapeutic properties. As
confirmed in our present study, both human NGAL and
murine Lcn2 counter-regulate EGCG-mediated inhibition
of MPO and LPO activity in a dose-dependent fashion. It
would appear that NGAL inhibits EGCG optimally at a
molar ratio NGAL:EGCG of 1:1, which is consistent with
a previous report that one molecule of NGAL can bind to
one molecule of EGCG.20 NGAL and its murine ortholog
Lcn2 are known to be significantly elevated in the
inflamed gut of humans75,76 and mice,77e79 respectively.
Therefore, NGAL/Lcn2 presents a possible counter-
regulatory role that potentially mitigates the efficacy of
EGCG in treating IBD. Future studies should consider
the levels of circulating/mucosal NGAL/Lcn2 in designing
an optimal dose of EGCG to be administered to patients
with IBD.
Overall, our study demonstrates that inhibition of MPO
by EGCG serves as a mechanism by which EGCG confers
protection against gut inflammation. Moreover, as shown in
Figure 8, the beneficial functions of EGCG potentially
depend on the environment in the gut (ie, dietary iron and
luminal NGAL/Lcn2, both of which counter-regulate EGCG
bioactivity). Thus, our data provide the experimental basis
to take these counter-regulatory factors into consideration to
further develop EGCG as a potential therapeutic agent to
treat human IBD.
