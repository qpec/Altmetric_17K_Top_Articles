IMPORTANCE Dermatography (medical tattooing) is often overlooked as an adjuvant
procedure to improve color mismatch in the head and neck area, and its effect on patient
satisfaction and quality of life has not been evaluated, to our knowledge.
OBJECTIVE To analyze the effect of dermatography on the subjective perception of the
appearance of scars and skin grafts and the quality of life in head and neck patients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Case series of patients undergoing dermatography at
the Netherlands Cancer Institute–Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital, Amsterdam, between
July 1, 2007, and April 1, 2015. Participants were invited to respond to 2 questionnaires
measuring their scar or graft appearance and their quality of life before and after
dermatography as an adjuvant treatment for benign or malignant head and neck tumors.
INTERVENTION Use of dermatography.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Two questionnaires evaluating a visual analog scale score
(range, 0-10) and multiple questions on a 5-point scale focusing on satisfaction with the
appearance and the quality of life.
RESULTS Among 76 patients, 56 (74%) were included in the study. The mean (SD) age of the
study cohort was 56.5 (16.0) years, and 42 (75%) were female. The mean improvement in
scar or skin graft perception on the visual analog scale of the modified Utrecht Questionnaire
for Outcome Assessment in Aesthetic Rhinoplasty before and after dermatography was 4
points. On the modified Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire, uniform improvement of
approximately 1 point across 9 questions was observed. The answers to all patient
satisfaction and quality-of-life questions on both questionnaires improved significantly after
dermatography.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Dermatography is an effectual adjuvant procedure to improve
the subjective perception of scar and skin graft appearance and the quality of life in head and
neck patients.

D
ermatography (medical tattooing), first documented
early in the 19th century, is performed most often for
nipple reconstruction after mastectomy.1-3 Despite
its popularity in breast reconstructing procedures, derma-
tography is used by few medical professionals as an adjuvant
to enhance the appearance of scars and skin grafts after head
and neck surgical procedures, which is unfortunate consid-
ering the wide range of applications and advantages this
type of treatment has to offer. Indications are numerous for
primary treatment (eg, postburn scar, vitiligo, alopecia of
eyebrow or scalp, and port-wine hemangioma) but also as an
adjuvant to previous surgery (eg, scar, skin graft, or free
flap).4-15 In addition to its use in improving the appearance
of lesions, another well-appreciated outcome of dermatogra-
phy is its smoothening effect on scars.16 Compared with sur-
gical options to improve scar or skin transplant appearance,
dermatography is minimally invasive, and complications sel-
dom occur.4,6,8,17,18
Although well documented in the literature, most studies
of dermatography have been observational.4,6,9,10,12,13,16,17,19,20
To our knowledge, this study is the first to statistically evalu-
ate patient satisfaction with the final result and their related
quality of life after dermatography in the head and neck area.
Methods
Patients
Institutional review board approval was not necessary for
this study because all research was done retrospectively
after treatment. All patients included in the study provided
oral informed consent.
In this case series, all patients receiving dermatography at
the Netherlands Cancer Institute–Antoni van Leeuwenhoek
Hospital, Amsterdam, were analyzed. Patients were eligible for
inclusion in the study if they underwent dermatography for
scarsorskingraftsorotherreconstructionintheheadandneck
region between July 1, 2007, and April 1, 2015.
Dermatography Technique
All dermatography procedures were performed by one of us
(B.H.D.). The pigments used for the technique include ferri-
and ferro-oxide, ferrohydroxide, titanium dioxide, tartra-
zine, and carbon. Mixing these pigments with 80% alcohol
yields a suspension. A series of 64 predeveloped standard col-
ors, varying in intensity from 10% to 100%, constitutes the ref-
erence by which a sliding color scale can be made.16
Disinfection of the skin is performed with 80% alcohol.16
Local anesthetic may be infiltrated to provide numbing and re-
duce bleeding during treatment. However, an anesthetic is
rarely used because it may result in dilution of the pigment and
therefore fading of color.13
Dermatography is performed using a modified tattooing
machine (Van der Velden Derma-injector; Medicer) consist-
ing of an electromechanical motor and a needle holder that is
movedupanddowninastainlesssteeltube(Figure1)ataspeed
between 500 and 3500 rpm.10,13,16 The number and arrange-
ment of the needles vary depending on the required color
intensity.13 The needles are disposable, with a length of 36 mm
and a diameter of 0.36 or 0.41 mm.16
The optimal level of pigment insertion is the upper and
midpapillary dermis.6 With the vertical movement of the
needles, an alternating effect of pressure and suction is initi-
ated by which the pigment suspension is deposited along
the needles. Depending on variations in anatomy, the depth
of the punctures varies between 0.6 and 2.2 mm.13 The angle
of the needle varies as well, from 10° to 90°. During the pro-
cedure, the skin is stretched with the thumb and index fin-
ger, and hemostasis is maintained by applying pressure.6,16
To enable the underlying skin color to be visible and to follow
seasonal variations, the pigment does not cover the skin com-
pletely but is injected to create a raster of punctures.
A pressure dressing, prophylactic antibiotics, and anti-
inflammatory drugs may be used after dermatography. If
needed, consecutive sessions may be scheduled at intervals
of 3 weeks or more until an optimal match with the surround-
ing skin color is reached.13,17 Touch-up procedures may be
needed if color fading occurs over time. Coloring of skin can
be combined with treatment of hypertrophic scars (intracica-
tricial keloidectomy). The cutting action of several needles
placed in a row reduces tissue volume and smoothens the
scar, making it level with its surroundings.16
Questionnaires
Two previously validated questionnaires21,22 were modified
to make them applicable to this study (Figure 2 and Figure 3).
First, the Utrecht Questionnaire for Outcome Assessment in
Aesthetic Rhinoplasty21 was altered for use in patients with
scars and skin grafts. The modified Utrecht questionnaire con-
sists of one question assessing scar or skin graft appearance
on a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 10, with 0 as
“very ugly” and 10 as “very nice.” Five subsequent questions
assessthequalityoflifeinrelationtothescarorskingraft,with
1 indicating “not at all” concerned and 5 indicating “very much
or often” concerned. Second, a selection of 9 questions from
the Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire22 was used. These
questions focused on patient appearance, scar conscious-
ness, and satisfaction with appearance on a 5-point scale.
Each questionnaire was answered twice. First, patients
were asked retrospectively about their situation before der-
matography. Next, the patients answered the questions
regarding their current situation after dermatography.
Key Points
Question What is the effect of scar and skin graft dermatography in
the head and neck area on patient satisfaction and quality of life?
Findings In a case series of 56 patients, the mean improvement in
scar or skin graft perception on a visual analog scale (score range,
0-10) was 4 points. All answers to patient satisfaction and quality-of-
life questions in 2 modified questionnaires improved significantly.
Meaning Dermatography is an effectual adjuvant procedure to
improve the subjective perception of scar and skin graft
appearance and the quality of life in head and neck patients.

To account for multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni-
adjusted significance level was set at P < 3.3 × 10−3. A soft-
ware program (R, version 3.2.3; R Foundation for Statistical
Computing) was used for the statistical analysis.
Results
Seventy-six patients undergoing dermatography were identi-
fied as eligible for this study. Among them, 56 were willing to
participate, for a response rate of 74%. Among the 20 ex-
cluded patients, 16 could not be contacted, 3 declined to par-
ticipate,and1haddied.Amongthe3patientswhodidnotwant
to participate, one immediately refused (with no explana-
tion), another stated that she was unable to “quantify” her
views, and the third regretted the dermatography because it
was interfering with diagnostic imaging (confocal micros-
copy) for a new primary lesion.
Themean(SD)ageofthestudycohortwas56.5(16.0)years.
Most patients had been treated for cutaneous malignant dis-
ease of the head and neck before receiving dermatography
(Table 1).
Almost all patients had a significant improvement on the
VAS. The mean difference on the VAS was −4.0 (95% CI, −4.6
to −3.3; P = 1.1 × 10−9). After dermatography, the mean VAS
score was 7.8. For the 5 remaining questions, a decrease in pa-
tient concern was observed, with all P values significant after
Bonferroni correction (Table 2). The same was true for the
modified Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire, with uni-
form improvement of approximately 1 point across the
9 questions (range, P = 5.6 × 10−6 to P = 1.5 × 10−9).
Discussion
Scar and skin graft color abnormalities can result in
impaired physical, psychological, and social well-being.23,24
In such cases, secondary reconstruction may be necessary
to improve the function or appearance of the postoperative
site. Well-known established adjuvant procedures to
enhance scar or skin graft appearance are dermabrasian,
scar excision, W-plasty, geometric broken line repair, or cor-
ticosteroid injections. As demonstrated herein, dermatogra-
phy is also a valuable nonsurgical alternative to improve
appearance and occasionally to also enhance function.
Unfortunately, the use of this adjuvant procedure is often
overlooked. Otolaryngologists and head and neck surgeons
may be less familiar with the technique than plastic sur-
geons who routinely use this procedure for nipple recon-
struction after mastectomy.1,2
Dermatography has numerous advantages, including no
donor-site morbidity, availability of a wide range of colors, no
requirement for hospitalization or general anesthesia, perma-
nent camouflage, and well-preserved sensation.8,17 More-
over, coloring of scars can be combined with intracicatricial
keloidectomy, in which the volume of hypertrophic scars is re-
duced by the cutting action of the needles.16 This action
smoothens the scar and reduces scar tension.
Few publications exist on the use of dermatography after
head and neck procedures.4,5,12,16,17 These studies were mainly
observational and did not focus on patient satisfaction and the
related quality of life after treatment. To evaluate these top-
ics in the present study, we searched the literature for vali-
dated questionnaires that were simple and short, but no such
questionnaires were found. We found 2 validated question-
naires that were usable after slight modification (Figure 2 and
Figure 3). The first was the Utrecht Questionnaire for Out-
comeAssessmentinAestheticRhinoplasty,21inwhichtheword
nose was changed to scar or skin graft. The second was the
PatientScarAssessmentQuestionnaire,22fromwhichwechose
the 9 most relevant questions because we considered 28
questions before and after therapy too long for our group of
head and neck patients.
In the Department of Head and Neck Oncology and Sur-
gery, Netherlands Cancer Institute–Antoni van Leeuwen-
hoek Hospital, dermatography is offered occasionally to pa-
tientswithhyperpigmentedandhypertrophicscars,thosewith
hypopigmented skin grafts, or patients missing a structural or-
gan (eg, hair-bearing skin, vermillion pigment, or eyebrow).
Primary treatment, such as surgery, radiotherapy, or chemo-
radiation, of the underlying disease should be completed be-
forestartingdermatography.Especiallyinthecaseofskingraft-
ing or flap surgery, the wound is given sufficient time to heal
before dermatography to ensure adequate perfusion and
healing.17
The results of the present study show that dermatogra-
phy is a valuable adjuvant treatment option. The scores on the
VAS pertaining to the appearance of the scar or skin graft im-
proved after treatment by 4 points on a 10-point scale. One ex-
ception was a patient with a history of inflammation and ra-
diotherapy before dermatography, resulting in a more difficult
treatment and a worse VAS score after treatment. In all other
patients,lesionappearanceandqualityofliferegardingthescar
or skin graft improved significantly (Table 2). After this mini-
mally invasive procedure, patients report not only improve-
ment in the appearance of their scar or skin graft but also
enhanced quality of life. To visualize the effect of the derma-
tography procedures, 3 cases are shown before and after
therapy (Figures 4, 5, and 6).

The technical aspects of dermatography differ little from
those of decorative tattooing. In both disciplines, various tat-
tooing machines and needles are used to inject pigment in the
dermis, but the materials injected in the procedures differ,
especially relative to the possibility of ink carcinogenesis.
Tattoo colorants contain pigments that include inorganic
metallic salts, various types of organic molecules, and or-
ganicdyes(traditionalink).Someofthesecomponentsareclas-
sified as possible carcinogenic agents.25 Instead of traditional
ink that is used in decorative tattooing, inorganic metallic salts
(eg, iron oxide dyes) and organic molecules (eg, tartrazine) are
used as coloring agents in dermatography because of their
structure that gives a more precise result.17 The association be-
tween tattooing and skin cancer is most likely multifactorial,
including trauma induced by the procedure, a lifetime inflam-
matory reaction in an attempt to degrade all foreign material,
and the ink content used.25 However, a review by Kluger et al25
concluded that the number of skin cancers arising in tattoos
is low and that any association thus far should be considered
coincidental. In addition, during 20 years of practicing der-
matography, one of us (B.H.D.) has observed no malignant
neoplasms in tattooed skin at our institute.
In addition to the colorant used, the final result after der-
matography is also influenced by procedural factors, namely,
the depth of pigment deposition, pigment density, and num-
ber of needles used. Patient factors include thickness and

able than tattooing in healthy tissue because pigment may ap-
pear less vivid and uneven when implanted in scar tissue.18
Dermatographyhasfewcontraindications.17Complications
mentioned in the literature are rare. Allergic reactions to tattoo
composition have been described and can range from a lichen-
oidreactiontocontactdermatitis.6,26Granulomatousreactions
may also occur. Along with local skin reactions, sarcoid granu-

or materials and insufficient hygiene, which is not the case in
the dermatography setting in a hospital.6,8,17,18,26 No complica-
tions occurred in the present study.
Dermatographyhasfewdisadvantages,includingtheneed

impedereflectanceconfocalmicroscopy,acellularlevelinvivo
imaging technique.28 Furthermore, tattoos containing metal-
lic elements may interact with magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI). Franiel et al29 reported a case of an MRI-induced first-
degree burn in a nonferrous tattoo of the eyelids caused by
locally induced electric current. Such burns can be induced by
any metal (not just ferromagnetic metals). However, another
study30 identified dysesthesia in only 2 of 135 patients with
tattoos undergoing MRI.
Facial tattooing is offered not only by skin or beauty thera-
pists but also by physicians. Especially in the facial plastic sur-
gical patient population, we believe that medical tattooing is
best performed by a trained physician, capable of assessing
the skin and able to prescribe medication, if necessary. Any-
one interested in this procedure should at least work under the
supervision of an experienced dermatographer for some time
because medical tattooing requires a certain amount of knowl-
edge and skill. To our knowledge, there is no international list
of physicians offering this service.
This study has some limitations. First, selection bias may
have occurred because those who benefited most from der-
matography were more likely to participate in the study than
those who did not. However, most of the exclusions were in-
dividuals who were unreachable, and only 3 of 20 exclusions
were due to refusal to participate in the interview. Second, the
retrospective nature of this study may have resulted in recall
bias,especiallyforthequestionsrelatingtotheconditionbefore

dermatography. However, patient report of the difference
before and after treatment expressed a positive change.
Third, we did not use photographs before and after treat-
ment. Such photographs can speak for themselves but may be
difficult to compare because of differences in angle and light-
ing or may represent only temporary results.31 On the other
hand, a patient’
s own subjective appearance is more mean-
ingful and ultimately is the most important measure of a
successful outcome.
Conclusions
Dermatography is an effectual adjuvant procedure to im-
prove the subjective perception of scar and skin graft appear-
ance and the quality of life in head and neck patients. There-
fore, the use of dermatography is warranted in the routine
workup of patients with problematic scars and skin graft
pigments after head and neck surgical procedures.
