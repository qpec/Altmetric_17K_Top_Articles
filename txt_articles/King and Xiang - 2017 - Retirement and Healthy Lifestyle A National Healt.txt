Retirement and Healthy Lifestyle: A National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) Data
Report
Dana E. King, MD, MS, and Jun Xiang, MS
Background: The objective of this study was to compare the rates of healthy lifestyle adherence among
retired late-middle-aged adults with rates among those who are still working.
Methods: A national cross-sectional study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation survey (NHANES). The main outcome was the proportion of retires versus nonretirees who were
adherent to ideal or intermediate goals of the American Heart Association’s Life’s Simple 7, cardiovas-
cular factors including physical activity, healthy diet, healthy weight, smoking status, total cholesterol,
glucose, and blood pressure.
Results: Retirees were more likely than nonretirees to have poorly controlled blood pressure (23.9%
vs 15.1%; P � .05). However, there were no differences in healthy weight, smoking rates, healthy diet,
or glucose or cholesterol control (P > .05). In controlled logistic regression analyses, retirees were
more likely to be physically active than nonretirees (odds ratio, 1.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–
3.09), but were not more likely to be following any other Life’s Simple 7 factors.
Conclusions: Retired adults were more likely to be physically active but were not more likely to be
adhering to most of the Life’s Simple 7 lifestyle and cardiovascular risk factors. More public health at-
tention to encouraging healthy lifestyles during the transition into retirement may be warranted. (J Am
Board Fam Med 2017;30:213–219.)

Recent research demonstrates challenges to
healthy lifestyle adherence among late-middle-
aged adults.1–4 Chronic disease, use of multiple
medications, and busy daily lives make following a
healthy lifestyle more difficult.5 Previous studies of
recent retirees indicate that the transition to retire-
ment may offer an opportunity for a “new start”
toward healthy living and greater adherence to rec-
ommended patterns of exercise and healthy habits.6
More unstructured time in retirement, fewer daily
obligations, and relief from daily commuting re-
sponsibilities were some of the reasons cited by
retirees that might offer increased opportunities to
more closely adhere to a healthy lifestyle.
The purpose of this study was to examine
whether retired late-middle-aged adults have dif-
fering rates of adherence to healthy lifestyle and
metabolic risk factors, including diet, exercise,
smoking, weight, glucose, blood pressure, and
cholesterol, compared with same-aged adults
who are not yet retired.7 The Life’s Simple 7 are
part of the American Heart Association’s (AHA’s)
goals for cardiovascular health for 2020. The
study population was a national sample of non-
institutionalized adults from the National He-

Methods
Study Population
The NHANES is a series of complex and multi-
stage surveys aiming to assess the health and nutri-
tional status of the noninstitutionalized population
of the United States. The study focused on a subset
of the “baby boomer” population, ages 55 to 70
years, a particular population of interest in previous
studies.1,3 The population was chosen because of
the desire to examine recent retirees lifestyles in
relation to nonretirees. This study compared the
difference in rates of adherence to healthy lifestyle
recommendations between late-middle-aged retir-
ees and a similar population who were not retired
from the NHANES 2009 to 2010 and NHANES
2011 to 2012 surveys.8 This study was reviewed and
exempted by the West Virginia University Health
Sciences Institutional Review Board.
Two questions were used as the inclusion crite-
ria for the study sample. Respondents who re-
sponded “retired” for the question, “What is the
main reason you did not work last week?” were
chosen as “retirees”; those who chose the answers
of either “working at a job or business” or “with a
job or business but not at work” to the item “type
of work done last week” were extracted as non–
retired subjects. Disabled persons were excluded
from the study to avoid the results being biased by
an inability to exercise or adhere to a healthy life-
style. Participants who did not answer the desig-
nated retirement questions also were excluded from
the study.
Healthy Lifestyle Metrics
Definitions used to measure the 7 components of
the study were adherent to Life’s Simple 7, a rela-
tively new cardiovascular health index published by
the AHA.7 The healthy lifestyle metrics selected
are physical activity, healthy diet, healthy weight,
and smoking status. Three metabolic risk factors
also are included in the AHA metrics: total choles-
terol, glucose, and blood pressure. These measures
were compared between the retired and nonretired
groups. Previous studies have examined these same
factors in similarly aged populations for the pur-
pose of evaluating cardiovascular risk factors and
lifestyle goals.2,3,5,9,10
Each component of Life’s Simple 7 was classi-
fied into 3 categories—ideal, intermediate, and
poor—and given a point score of 0, 1, or 2, respec-
tively. The detailed definitions of the Life’s Simple
7 components are presented in Table 1. We
adapted the definitions of the Life’s Simple 7 com-
ponents based on the availability of the NHANES
data. For the 3 metabolic risk factor components,
we used the current level attained, regardless of
treatment, for the measurements and categorized
participants according to the AHA’s metrics of
ideal, intermediate, or poor categories.
For the healthy diet determination, we incorpo-
rated the Food Patterns Equivalents Database cre-
ated by the US Department of Agriculture to the
selected NHANES cycles. Instead of using infor-
mation on sugar-sweetened beverage intake, which
was unavailable in the 2 NHANES cohorts we se-
lected, we replaced it with added-sugar intake based
on the daily intake recommendation from the AHA.
Daily intakes for fruits and vegetables, whole
grains, sodium, and added sugar, and number of
times per week for all kinds of fish were added
together, first from individual food. We then recal-
culated each individual’s fruit and vegetable intake
and whole-grain intake based on a recommended
2000 calories/day reference diet. We assigned 1
point each to subjects consuming fruits and vege-
tables (�4.5 cups/day), whole grains (� 3 oz/day),
sodium (�1500 mg/day), added sugar (�37.5 g/day
for men, �25 g/day for women), and fish (� 2
times/week). Finally, the points were summed and
subjects were categorized in the healthy diet com-
ponent as “4 to 5 points” for ideal, “2 to 3 points”
for intermediate, and “0 to 1 points” for poor.
For physical activity, we calculated the total
minutes a subject spent on vigorous and moderate
recreational activities per week, then assigned the
subjects into categories of ideal, intermediate, and
poor according to the definitions in Life’s Simple 7.
Other demographic covariates selected for this
study included age, sex, height, weight, race, health
insurance status, and socioeconomic status (ratio of
family income to poverty). Race was combined to 4
categories of “white,” “black,” “Hispanic,” and
“other race.” Ratio of family income to poverty was
recoded as “high” for �1.0 and “low” for �1.0.
Subjects’ age, height, and weight were obtained.
Health insurance status was divided into 3 catego-
ries: no health insurance, public health insurance,
and private insurance. Body mass index (BMI) was

and obese (�30 kg/m2) based on the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention breakdown.
Statistical Analysis
SAS software (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC) was used to perform the statistical analysis. We
incorporated the 4-year weights calculated using the
method provided by NCHS (National Center for
Health Statistics) to account for the complex survey
design (including oversampling), survey nonresponse,
and poststratification. The presence of a difference
between retirees and nonretirees was determined us-
ing a �2 analysis with the SURVEYFREQ procedure
and regression analysis with the SURVEYREG pro-
cedure. For some of the analyses, the sample size was
affected by the somewhat smaller subsample of indi-
viduals who had glucose testing measurements avail-
able in the NHANES 2009 to 2012 cohorts.
To further analyze the data, we constructed a
new dichotomous variable for each of the 7 com-
ponents of the study. Except healthy diet, all other
6 components were recoded using “1” for ideal
category and “0” for the other categories. We re-
coded healthy diet combining ideal and intermedi-
ate as “1” and poor as “0” because of the very small
number of respondents in the “ideal” category. A
logistic regression analysis using the SURVEYLO-
GISTIC procedure was then conducted to see
whether the results were consistent with the �2
analysis when adjusted for age, sex, race, health
insurance status, and socioeconomic status. P � .05
was used to account for statistical significance.

 and 481 from NHANES 2011 to 2012, represents
a population estimate of 19,724,643 people.
The results presented in Table 3 indicate that
retired late-middle-aged adults were more likely to
have poorly controlled blood pressure (23.9% vs
15.1%; P � .05) than nonretirees. They were not
more likely than their counterparts to have low
physical activity (44.6% vs 47.8%; P � .17), achieve
an ideal or intermediate healthy weight (52.4%
vs 60.0%; P � .25), or have an ideal or interme-
diate healthy diet (29.9% vs 22.6%; P � .21).
Nonsmoking rates were similar among retirees
and nonretirees (86.5% vs 83.7%; P � .27).
There were no differences in glucose or choles-
terol control (P � .05).
In logistic regression analyses presented in Ta-
ble 4, after adjusting for age, sex, race, health in-
surance status, and socioeconomic status, retirees
were more likely to be physically active than non-
retirees (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.11–3.09), but not
more likely to be following a healthy diet or con-
trolling blood pressure, weight, or any of the other
Life’s Simple 7 factors.
Discussion
This study demonstrates that retired adults gener-
ally were no more likely to be adherent to the
AHA’s Life’s Simple 7 healthy lifestyle recommen-
dations in several important measures compared
with same age nonretired individuals. After con-
trolling for socioeconomic and demographic fac-
tors, only physical activity was more likely to be
greater in retirees. Retirees’ adherence to ideal or
intermediate goals for smoking, cholesterol, BMI,
glucose, and diet were not significantly different
from nonretired adults of similar age.
These results indicate that taking advantage of
added time to attend to a healthier lifestyle during
retirement is not occurring on a regular basis. The

 reasons are not entirely clear, but several possibil-
ities could be considered.
New retirees may not have retired voluntarily,
and instead may have become disabled by illness or
injury that made them unable to continue work-
ing.11–13 This study excluded disabled persons to
reduce the risk of this bias.
Another possibility is that limited financial or
other social resources may change during retire-
ment and make it more difficult for new retirees to
consume a healthy diet and or other lifestyle activ-
ities.14,15 Fresh foods, medication costs and co-
pays, and other healthy lifestyle costs may not be in
the limited budget of many retirees. In this study,
even after controlling for demographic, insurance,
and socioeconomic status, the retirees did not sig-

 nificantly increase most healthy lifestyle habits,
with the exception of physical activity. This excep-
tion may be because of the relative ease of walking
and other similar physical activities (gardening, bi-
cycling) that present few barriers or expense to
retirees.
Another possibility to explain mostly no change
in healthy lifestyle factors is that the reduced social
interaction during retirement and isolation from
the workplace may affect mood or motivation to
pursue a healthy lifestyle.16,17 Such isolation could
diminish
opportunities
for
reinforcement
of
healthy lifestyles or motivation for healthy living.
In addition, transportation options may change
during retirement, such that trips to fresh food
markets or medical appointments may be less avail-
able. In this study we were able to take age, sex,
race, and socioeconomic status into account, but we
did not have access to specific social isolation pa-
rameters that might also mediate the association.
The study also has several strengths worth re-
viewing. The study was conducted using a national
sample
of
noninstitutionalized
adults
that
is
weighted for demographic factors that might skew
the sample.8 In addition, the study included con-
firmation of clinical parameters not found in many
national surveys, including blood pressure, choles-
terol, and glucose levels.2,3,9,10
This study also has some limitations. The sam-
ple is cross-sectional; thus the data can be used to
explore associations but not support causality. In
addition, the information is directly from the par-
ticipants’ self-report, without other confirmation of
diagnoses or adherence to lifestyle habits. Finally,
the transition to retirement is multifaceted; thus
survey questions regarding retirement status are
inherently 1-dimensional assessments of a complex
situation.18
Conclusion
The findings of this study indicate that retire-
ment does not have a strong association with im-
provements in healthy lifestyle habits or other car-
diovascular risk factors. Retired baby boomers were
no more likely to be controlling their weight, blood
Pressure, or glucose, and were no more likely to be
following a healthy diet. Only physical activity was
likely to increase after retirement. Research is
needed to further understand health and lifestyle
challenges during the transition to retirement.
