Abstract
Equol, a metabolite of the dietary isoflavone daidzein, is produced by the action of gut bacteria in some individuals who are termed as
equol-producers. It is proposed to have stronger atheroprotective properties than dietary isoflavones. We examined a cross-sectional
association of dietary isoflavones and equol-producer status with coronary artery calcification (CAC), a biomarker of coronary atherosclerosis,
among men in Japan. A population-based sample of 272 Japanese men aged 40–49 years recruited from 2004 to 2007 was examined for serum
isoflavones, serum equol, CAC and other factors. Equol-producers were classified as individuals having a serum level of equol >83 nM. The
presence of CAC was defined as a coronary Ca score ≥10 Agatston units. The associations of dietary isoflavones and equol-producers with
CAC were analysed using multiple logistic regression. The median of dietary isoflavones, equol and CAC were 512·7 (interquartile range (IQR)
194·1, 1170·0), 9·1 (IQR 0·10, 33·1) and 0·0 (IQR 0·0, 1·0) nM, respectively. Prevalence of CAC and equol-producers was 9·6 and 16·0 %,
respectively. Dietary isoflavones were not significantly associated with CAC. After multivariable adjustment, the OR for the presence of CAC in
equol-producers compared with equol non-producers was 0·10 (95 % CI 0·01, 0·90, P < 0·04). Equol-producers had significantly lower CAC
than equol non-producers, but there was no significant association between dietary isoflavones and CAC, suggesting that equol may be a key
factor for atheroprotective properties of isoflavones in Japanese men. This finding must be confirmed in larger studies or clinical trials of equol
that is now available as a dietary supplement.

Isoflavones
are
micronutrients
of
non-steroidal
structure
derived mainly from soyabeans that mimic oestrogen in struc-
ture and action and are therefore classified as bioactive phyto-
oestrogens(1).
Unlike
oestrogen,
isoflavones
preferentially
bind
to
oestrogen
receptor
β
(ER-β),
expressed
in
the
vasculature, rather than to the ER-α(1). The predominant
isoflavones are genistein and daidzein(1). Isoflavones are pro-
posed to be protective against CHD(2). The beneficial effect of
isoflavones on CHD may be derived from their atheroprotective
properties mediated via: (a) reductions in blood lipids(3) and
blood
pressure(4),
(b)
improved
endothelial
function(5,6),
(c) antioxidant activity that may prevent oxidative damage to
LDL-cholesterol(7,8) and other properties(9–11).
Randomised controlled trials of dietary isoflavones on coro-
nary and carotid arteries in monkeys clearly demonstrate the
atheroprotective properties of isoflavones(12,13). Furthermore,
observational studies in Asian countries, where dietary intake of
isoflavones is common have documented significant inverse
associations between isoflavones and incident CHD(14–16).
However, a recent randomised controlled trial of dietary
isoflavones on atherosclerosis in the USA, where dietary intake
of isoflavone is miniscule compared with Asian countries, failed
to show a benefit(17). An equol hypothesis has been proposed
to explain the discrepancy in cardiovascular benefits among
animals, Asian and Western countries(18). Equol is a metabolite
of the dietary isoflavone daidzein that is produced by the action
of gut microflora(18). Equol has a stronger affinity for the ER-β
than its precursor daidzein and similar to genistein, has a longer
half-life and bio-availability than genistein and daidzein, and the
highest antioxidant properties of the isoflavones, in vitro(18,19).
Thus, equol may have greater atheroprotective properties
than other isoflavones. According to the ‘equol hypothesis’,

 individuals with the ability to produce equol are termed
‘equol-producers’. They derive greater clinical benefits from
equol than individuals who are unable to produce equol termed
‘equol non-producers’(18). All monkeys can produce equol(20).
Although the prevalence of equol-producers is reported to be
50–60 % in Asian countries, it is reported to be much lower in
Western (25–30 %) than Asian countries(21).
The atheroprotective properties of dietary isoflavones have
been demonstrated in both male and female monkeys(12,13)
unlike humans where the atheroprotective effects are primarily
investigated in women(14–16). No previous study has examined
the association between dietary isoflavones or equol with the
presence of coronary artery calcification (CAC). CAC is a
well-established biomarker of atherosclerosis that is positively
associated with the future risk of CHD independent of tradi-
tional risk factors(22). We aimed to examine the association of
dietary isoflavone and equol-producer status with the presence
of CAC in Japanese men in the Electron-Beam Computed
Tomography and Risk Factor Assessment among Japanese and
U.S. Men in the Post World War II Birth Cohort study. We
hypothesise that the atheroprotective effect of isoflavones are
mediated through equol therefore equol but not isoflavones
would be associated with reduced CAC.
Methods
Study population
The methods for selecting the participants have been described
in detail previously(23). In brief, from 2002 to 2007, 303 men
aged 40–49 years were randomly selected from Kusatsu, Shiga,
Japan. Participants were without clinical CVD, type 1 diabetes
or other severe diseases. All participants provided informed
consent. The study was approved by the Institutional Review
Boards of the Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Japan
and the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, USA.
Measurement of covariates
A questionnaire for lifestyle habits, physical examination and
laboratory assessment were conducted on all participants(23).
Alcohol intake was categorised as nil, 1–23, 24–46, 46–69 and
>69 g/d(24). Heavy drinking was defined as >69 g/d of alcohol
intake. Meat eaters were defined as participants consuming
meat ≥2–3 times/week. Exercise was defined as at least 1 h
of exercise/week. Education was ascertained as years of
schooling. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure
≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg or
use of antihypertensive medications(25). Diabetes was defined
as fasting glucose ≥7 mmol/l or use of medications for
diabetes(26). Use of blood pressure-lowering, diabetes and
lipid-lowering medications were ascertained by questionnaire.
Blood samples were stored at −80°C and shipped on dry ice
to the University of Pittsburgh. Serum/plasma samples were
assayed for lipids including total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol
and HDL-cholesterol, glucose, and C-reactive protein (CRP) at
the University of Pittsburgh as described previously(23). Serum
n-3 fatty acids were analysed by capillary GLC(23). n-3 Fatty
acids were defined as the sum of EPA and DHA.
Measurements of serum isoflavones
Dietary isoflavones were assessed as the sum of the serum
levels of daidzein and genistein. Daidzein, genistein and
equol concentrations were measured using a modified method
of
Pumford
et
al.(27).
Daidzein-d4
and
genistein-d4
(Cambridge
Isotope
Laboratories)
and
equol-d4
(Medical
Isotopes Inc.) were added and the samples incubated with
β-glucuronidase. The samples were extracted with diethyl ether,
dried under N2 and silylated. The samples were analysed by
GC-MS in the selected ion monitoring mode. Ions monitored
(m/z) were: 425/482, 234/470 and 555 for daidzein, equol and
genistein, respectively; 428/485, 236/474 and 559 for daidzein-
d4, equol-d4 and genistein-d4, respectively. The CV were 9·5,
15·2 and 5·4 % for daidzein, genistein and equol, respectively.
Measurement of coronary artery calcification
CAC scanning was performed with a GE-Imatron C150 EBT
scanner (GE Medical Systems) as described elsewhere in
detail(23). In brief, a standardised protocol was used to perform
CAC scanning; 30–40 contiguous, 3-mm-thick transverse images
from the level of the aortic root to the apex of the heart. Images
were obtained during maximal breath holding by using
electrocardiogram triggering. Images were recorded onto a disc
in Japan and shipped to the University of Pittsburgh to be read
by a trained reader using Digital Imaging and Communica-
tions in Medicine workstation and software by AccuImage
(AccuImage Diagnostic Corp.). The software program imple-
ments the widely accepted Agatston scoring method(28). CAC
was considered to be present when 3 contiguous pixels
(area = 1 mm2) >130 Hounsfield Unit were detected overlying
the vessels of interest. The reader was blinded to the partici-
pants’ characteristics. Intra-class correlation for re-examination
of non-zero coronary calcium score (CCS) was 0·98.
Statistical analyses
The associations of dietary isoflavones and equol-producer
status with CAC were examined in 274 participants after
excluding very heavy alcohol drinkers (n 31). In a previous
report for this population, we reported that heavy alcohol
drinkers, those consuming ≥69 g/d of alcohol, had more than
ten times higher risk for CAC than moderate drinkers (23–45 g/d
of alcohol) and about four times higher risk for CAC than never
drinkers independent of traditional risk factors(24), which is
unlikely to be completely attenuated by anti-atherosclerotic
properties of any single known dietary component such as
isoflavones or equol. The cut-off point of CCS ≥10 Agatston
unit was used to define the presence of CAC, as previously
reported(29). CCS between 1 and 9 is likely to be noise.
Tertiles of dietary isoflavones were used as the independent
variables in the model because distribution of isoflavones
was highly skewed to the right. Baseline characteristics of
participants were expressed as means (standard deviation) or

 medians (interquartile range) for continuous variables and as
percentages for categorical variables according to tertiles of
dietary isoflavones. To examine the trend for the association
among tertiles of dietary isoflavones with cardiovascular risk
and other factors, general linear model, Jonckheere–Terpstra
trend test and Cochran–Armitage trend test for continuous
variables distributed normally, continuous variables distributed
non-normally and binary variables were used, respectively.
To examine the association of equol-producer status with the
presence of CAC, serum levels of >83 nM was used as the cut-off
point for defining equol-producer status as recommended by
Setchell et al.(30). The baseline characteristics of the participants
were expressed as means (standard deviation) or medians
(interquartile range) and as percentages for continuous and
categorical variables according to equol producing status.
t Tests or Kruskal–Wallis tests and χ2 tests were used to test for
differences in continuous variables and categorical variable
between equol-producers and equol non-producers.
To analyse the multivariable association of dietary iso-
flavones and equol-producer status
with CAC, multivari-
able logistic regression was used in the following models:
(i) unadjusted; (ii) adjusted for traditional cardiovascular risk
factors, age, pack-years of smoking, BMI, LDL-cholesterol,
diabetes
(yes/no)
and
hypertension
(yes/no)
(model
I);
(iii) model I + further adjusted for other cardiovascular risk fac-
tors, alcohol consumption, CRP and lipid medication (yes/no)
(model II); (iv) model II + further adjusted for lifestyle risk
factors, serum levels of n-3 fatty acids and meat consumption
(≥2–3 times/week) (model III); and (v) only for association of
equol-producer status with CAC, model III + further adjusted for
total serum isoflavones (model IV).
The primary aim of our study was to examine differences in
subclinical atherosclerosis among different races. Therefore, in
this study, we performed an exploratory analysis. A logistic
regression of CCS ≥10 on equol-producer status with a sample
size of 567 observations (of which 84 % are equol non-producers
and 16 % are equol-producers as in our study) achieves 80 %
power at a 0·05 significance level to detect a change in prob-
ability of CCS ≥10 from the baseline value of 0·11 (proportion
of equol non-producers in our study) to 0·02 (proportion of
equol-producers in our study). This change corresponds to an
OR of 0·17. An adjustment was made since a multiple regression
of equol-producer status on the other independent variables in
the logistic regression obtained an R2 of 0·13.
In sensitivity analyses, the association of dietary isoflavones
and equol-producer status with CAC was examined without
excluding heavy drinkers. The definition of equol-producers
using serum equol concentrations is not firmly established.
Therefore, alternate definitions of 20 and 40 nM, utilised by
previous studies were also used for defining equol-producer
status(31). A two-sided P value < 0·05 was considered significant.
All analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.3 of
the SAS System.
Results
Table 1 describes characteristics of the study population by
tertiles of dietary isoflavones. The ranges of serum levels of
isoflavones in tertile 1, tertile 2 and tertile 3 were 0·0–274·7,
274·8–843·8, and 843·9–7639·5, respectively. With increasing
tertiles of dietary isoflavones, no significant trend existed for
BMI, hypertension, LDL-cholesterol, diabetes, pack-years of
smoking or CAC. Table 2 presents the descriptive characteristics
of the study population by equol producing status. About 16 %
of the individuals (n 43) were equol-producers. There were no
significant differences between the two groups in age, BMI,
hypertension, LDL-cholesterol, diabetes and pack-years of
smoking. The levels of serum n-3 fatty acids were significantly
lower but the concentrations of dietary isoflavones were
significantly higher in equol-producers than among equol
non-producers. The prevalence of CAC was lower among
equol-producers (2·3 %) than non-producers (10·9 %) but the
difference was not statistically significant (P = 0·09).
Table 3 describes the results of multiple logistic regression
analyses between tertiles of isoflavones and the presence of
CAC. In the unadjusted model, the isoflavones were not
significantly
associated
with
the
presence
of
CAC.
The
non-significant association between dietary isoflavones and
the presence of CAC persisted after adjusting for covariates. The
results did not materially change after including heavy alcohol
drinkers (online Supplementary Table S1).
Table 4 presents the results for the multivariable logistic
regression association of equol-producers with CAC. In the
unadjusted analysis, the OR for the presence of CAC in
equol-producers compared with equol non-producers was 0·19
(95 % CI 0·03, 1·47, P = 0·11). After multivariable adjustment, OR
for the presence of CAC was 0·09 (95 % CI 0·01, 0·89, P = 0·04)
with 90 % lower odds of CAC in equol-producers compared
with equol non-producers. In sensitivity analysis, when heavy
drinkers were included, multivariable adjusted OR was 0·49
(95 % CI 0·15, 1·58, P = 0·23) that did not reach statistical
significance (online Supplementary Table S2).
The percentage of participants with equol ≥40 nM was 22·4 %
and with equol ≥20 nM was 40·3 %. There were no statistically
significant associations between equol-producer status and
the presence of CAC using these alternate definitions for
equol-producers (online Supplementary Table S3), although the
odds for the presence of CAC were 50 % lower among
equol-producers than among equol non-producers when using
a cut-off value of 40 nM.
Discussion
In this population based of healthy middle-aged Japanese men
in Japan, dietary isoflavones were not significantly associated
with CAC. However, equol-producers had significantly less CAC
than equol non-producers. These results suggest that equol may
be an important factor for the anti-atherosclerotic effects of
dietary isoflavones. This is the first study to report a significant
inverse association of equol with CAC among men.
In accordance with our study, in a case–control study of
Chinese adults, urinary levels of equol but not of isoflavones
were significantly and inversely associated with incident CHD
in women(16). In women, the OR of CHD was 0·46 (95 % CI
0·24, 0·89, P = 0·02) in the highest compared with the lowest
quartile of equol. The men had 34 % lower odds of CHD in the

 highest compared with the lowest quartile of equol but the OR
was not significant 0·76 (95 % CI 0·39, 1·49). This may be due
to a shorter duration of follow-up for the men than the women,
5 years compared with 10 years, respectively.
Three clinical trials among post-menopausal women have
examined the effect of dietary isoflavone on progression of
intima-media thickness of the carotid artery (CIMT), another
biomarker of atherosclerosis(17,32,33). These trials generally
reported negative results. However, in the Women’s Isoflavone
Soy Health (WISH) trial, a positive association between dietary
isoflavone and progression of CIMT was observed in women
who were in their initial 5 years of menopause. The WISH trial
examined the association of equol-producers with progression
of CIMT; no significant association was found. Nevertheless,
the WISH trial was not statistically powered to examine this
hypothesis. Moreover, the WISH trial defined equol-producers
as plasma levels of equol ≥ 20 nM. This cut-off point for
defining equol-producers may have classified several equol
non-producers as equol-producers that may have led to a
non-significant
association
between
equol-producers
and
progression of CIMT.
It is notable that dietary isoflavones have been associated
with reduced incidence of CHD in China and Japan(14–16), but
not in Western countries(34), in observational epidemiological
studies. This variable effect of isoflavones between Asian and
Western countries may be attributed to differences in the
amount of intake of isoflavones and the prevalence of equol-
producers. The daily intake of isoflavones is much higher
in China and Japan than in Western countries, 25–50 mg
compared with 1–2 mg, respectively(35). In line with the higher
dietary intake of isoflavones in Japan than Western countries,
more than ten times higher levels of serum isoflavones
have been reported in Japan than in Western countries(31,36,37).
In our study, the high levels of serum isoflavones with a median
of 512 nmol/l are in accordance with the high levels previously
reported in the Japanese. Moreover, the prevalence of equol-
producers is reported to be almost double in Japan than
Western
countries(21).

dies because different serums cut-off values were used to define
equol-producers in Japanese men(31).
It is argued that the discrepancy between the results of
observational studies in Asian countries showing a favourable
effect of isoflavones on the risk of CHD and clinical trials in the
Western countries showing a null effect may be attributed to:
(1) ‘healthy user effect’, a form of selection bias, and/or (2) the
differences in the form of intake of isoflavones and the timing
and duration of the exposure of isoflavones(38,39).
First, ‘healthy user effect’ in observational studies among
Asians is less likely to play a role because the intake of
isoflavones in Asian countries is almost universal(40). Therefore,
in these studies, the possibility of selection of participants
consuming higher amount of isoflavones with underlying
healthy behaviours, leading to a significant inverse association
between isoflavone intake and CHD is less likely. Second, the
favourable results in Asian countries are based on intake of
traditional soya foods such as tofu, miso and soya milk, etc. in
contrast to isoflavone supplements utilised in randomised
clinical trials in the Western countries. There is a possibility
of interaction of isoflavones with other components of soya
in populations consuming traditional soya foods such that
this interaction may lead to more beneficial effects than sup-
plementation of individual soya components in clinical trials.
Interaction of isoflavones with other components of soya in
traditional soya food might potentially affect the percen-
tage of individuals converting isoflavones to equol that needs
investigation in the future. Furthermore, the exposure of
isoflavones in Asian begins at an early age compared with
the Western countries. In fact, a body of evidence suggests
that to derive benefits of isoflavones in case of breast cancer,
the
exposure
to
isoflavones
must
begin
in
childhood/
adolescence(39). Although, currently there is no such evidence

 in context of CHD; the possibility of an early exposure of soya
foods leading to a greater percentage of equol-producers than
the exposure late in life is again a theme to be investigated.
Our study has several strengths. This is the first study to
report lower coronary atherosclerosis among equol-producers
than equol non-producers. Previous studies reporting the
association of dietary isoflavones with atherosclerosis and CHD
are primarily among women yet we have shown a significant
inverse association among men. The population-based sample
of our study minimises the opportunity for selection bias in
explaining the association between equol and CAC. Our study
population had a large variation in serum levels of isoflavones;
association between exposure and outcome can be more easily
assessed when level of exposure is variable.
The results of this study should be interpreted in light of
certain limitations. The sample size of our study is small and
therefore there is a probability of type 1 error. Men were the only
participants in our study and therefore generalisability cannot
be inferred. We used a single measure of serum levels of
isoflavones as an indicator of long-term intake. Serum levels
of isoflavones provide an estimate of short-term dietary exposure
to isoflavones(41). However, serum levels of isoflavones are a
good indicator of dietary intake in the Japanese because
Japanese consume soya products daily(42). In the Japanese, the
correlation coefficients of serum and 28-d dietary records for
daidzein and genistein is reported to be 0·39 (P < 0·05) and 0·42
(P < 0·05)(43), respectively, considered high for dietary compo-
nents(44). Moreover, the seasonal variation in isoflavone intake
assessed by serum and dietary questionnaire is small in Japan(45).
Serum levels of equol are influenced by variations in the
intake of dietary isoflavones, absorption and bioavailability of
isoflavones, and in the methodologies used to measure
equol(21). However, because the variation in the serum levels
of equol occurs randomly, the actual association of equol-
producers with coronary atherosclerosis would be stronger than
was observed in this study. Debate exists in the scientific
community whether it is equol per se or the ability to produce
equol, ‘equol phenotype’ that is responsible for clinical
effectiveness of soya isoflavones(46). Genetic and microbiome
studies on the equol phenotype would illuminate this debate
in the future.
We defined the presence of coronary atherosclerosis as CCS
≥10 that may not be strongly related to cardiovascular outcome.
Yet, a meta-analysis show that individuals with CCS ≥0
compared with individuals with CCS = 0 have a significant
higher total mortality(47). Although we adjusted for various
potential confounders (e.g. meat, n-3, CRP); we cannot exclude
the possibility of residual or unmeasured confounding.
To conclude, among Japanese men, equol-producers had
lower CAC than equol non-producers independent of cardio-
vascular risk factors. The inverse association of CAC was not
observed with dietary isoflavones, thus indicating that equol
may be a key factor for the atheroprotective properties of
dietary isoflavones. Not all human adults are able to convert
isoflavone daidzein to equol. The availability of equol as a
nutraceutical or pharmaceutical agent(48) may extend the
benefit of preventing CHD to everyone. Prospective studies and
clinical trials are warranted to expand on these findings.
