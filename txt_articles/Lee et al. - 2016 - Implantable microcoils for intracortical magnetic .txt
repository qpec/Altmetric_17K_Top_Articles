Implantable microcoils for intracortical
magnetic stimulation

Neural prostheses that stimulate the neocortex have the potential to treat a wide range of neurological disorders.
However, the efficacy of electrode-based implants remains limited, with persistent challenges that include an in-
ability to create precise patterns of neural activity as well as difficulties in maintaining response consistency over
time. These problems arise from fundamental limitations of electrodes as well as their susceptibility to implantation
and have proven difficult to overcome. Magnetic stimulation can address many of these limitations, but coils small
enough to be implanted into the cortex were not thought strong enough to activate neurons. We describe a new
microcoil design and demonstrate its effectiveness for both activating cortical neurons and driving behavioral re-
sponses. The stimulation of cortical pyramidal neurons in brain slices in vitro was reliable and could be confined to
spatially narrow regions (<60 mm). The spatially asymmetric fields arising from the coil helped to avoid the simulta-
neous activation of passing axons. In vivo implantation was safe and resulted in consistent and predictable behav-
ioral responses. The high permeability of magnetic fields to biological substances may yield another important
advantage because it suggests that encapsulation and other adverse effects of implantation will not diminish coil
performance over time, as happens to electrodes. These findings suggest that a coil-based implant might be a useful
alternative to existing electrode-based devices. The enhanced selectivity of microcoil-based magnetic stimulation
will be especially useful for visual prostheses as well as for many brain-computer interface applications that require
precise activation of the cortex.
INTRODUCTION
Neural prostheses that can reliably and effectively activate the cor-
tex have the potential to treat a wide range of neurological and psy-
chiatric disorders (1–4). However, effective activation is difficult,
given the large diversity of cell types within the cortex coupled with
an inability to selectively target (or avoid) individual types. Further,
passing axons from neurons located in distant parts of the brain are
highly sensitive to prosthetic stimulation (5); this can lead to the spread
of activation well beyond the local region surrounding a given electrode
and further diminish the ability to create precise patterns of neural
activity (6–8). Maintaining response consistency over time with im-
planted electrodes has also been proven to be challenging (1, 9, 10). For
example, electrodes implanted into the primary visual cortex (V1) of
macaque monkeys each reliably elicited a visual percept (phosphene)
shortly after implantation, but individual electrodes lost effectiveness
within a few months (9). Although larger groupings of electrodes could
be used to generate phosphenes, the need to couple electrodes together
represents a significant loss in potential visual acuity. Although the
factors underlying this loss in performance are not fully known, implan-
tation into the cortex is known to induce a foreign body response that
can include inflammation as well as other adverse biological reactions.
The formation of glial scarring around individual electrodes (11, 12) can
alter or even block the electric fields induced by the stimulus with a
change (or even loss) of the resultant neural response. Although in-
creases to the amplitude of stimulation can sometimes be used to re-elicit
some behavioral responses, the associated increase in power usage is
detrimental, especially to devices intended for long-term implantation.
Magnetic stimulation from implantable microcoils offers several
potential advantages over conventional electrode-based stimulation.
For example, unlike the fields arising from electrodes, the electric fields
that arise from magnetic stimulation are spatially asymmetric and can
therefore be harnessed to selectively activate some neuronal subpopula-
tions while simultaneously avoiding others (13, 14). In the cortex, this
could include, for example, the ability to activate vertically oriented py-
ramidal neurons (PNs) without activating horizontally oriented passing
axons. Another potential advantage of microcoils is that unlike the
electric fields initiated by electrodes, magnetic fields pass readily
through biological materials, and therefore their efficacy will not be
diminished, even by severe encapsulation. A third advantage is that
the lack of direct contact between the metal coil and neural tissue makes
coil-based stimulation less prone to the numerous problems that can
arise at the brain-electrode interface (10, 11, 15, 16), for example, the
damage to the electrode and/or the surrounding tissue that can arise
from delivery of high levels of charge. Further, coils can be completely
insulated with soft biocompatible materials that have been shown to
mitigate the cortical response to implantation (17, 18).
Although the potential benefits of magnetic stimulation have been
known for a long time, it was generally thought that coils small enough
to be implanted into the cortex could not generate fields that were strong
enough to modulate neuronal activity. Several years ago, Bonmassar et al.
(13) showed that a commercial inductor, 500 mm in diameter and 1 mm
long, could modulate activity of central nervous system neurons. They
further showed that the field asymmetries from the inductor could be
exploited to selectively activate some types of neurons while simulta-
neously avoiding others. Although this was encouraging, the cross-
sectional profile of the inductor used in their study was still nearly
100× that of commonly used implants, thereby raising concerns about
the ability to implant safely into the cortex. Nevertheless, the ability to
activate neurons with small coils raised the possibility that even fur-
ther reductions in coil size might be achievable. New, more efficient
designs might also help to reduce the power levels associated with
microcoils, which, despite some reduction since the original study, re-
main well above the levels associated with electric stimulation.

 Here, to explore the viability of coils small enough to be safely
implanted, we first developed a computational model that allowed
us to rapidly assess the potential effectiveness of new designs. We
found that simple bends of microwires could generate fields that
exceeded the known thresholds for neuronal activation. Fabricated
prototypes were comparable in size to existing electrode implants and
therefore, in addition to in vitro testing, could be safely implanted
into the cortex for in vivo evaluation of their ability to drive neural
circuits. Our results strongly support the viability of implantable micro-
coils as an attractive alternative to conventional electrode implants.
RESULTS
Computational modeling of microcoils
To better understand whether coils that are small enough to be im-
planted can activate cortical neurons, we modeled the fields arising
from a single loop of the inductor used in previous microcoil studies
(13, 14, 19). The dimensions of the loop were 500 mm × 500 mm, and
the wire thickness was 10 mm (Fig. 1A, left). After deriving the
magnetic and electric fields that arose from the single loop (Materials
and Methods), we calculated the gradient of the electric field along
three orthogonal dimensions; the strength of the gradient along the
length of a neuron or axon is known to underlie activation (5, 20),
so surface plots that displayed the field gradient across the region
surrounding the coil (Fig. 1A, middle) could be used to quickly assess
potential effectiveness. We were especially interested in the com-
ponent of the gradient oriented normal to the cortical surface (dEx/
dx using the axes of Fig. 1), because this represents the driving force
for activation of vertically oriented PNs. Whereas the peak amplitude
of the stimulus current through the coil in previous studies could ex-
ceed 1 A, here we found that an amplitude of 1 mA produced a peak
field gradient of ~50,000 V/m2 (Fig. 1A, right), a value well above the
11,000-V/m2 threshold previously reported for stimulation of
peripheral axons with a transcranial magnetic stimulation coil (21).
This therefore suggests that even a single loop of appropriately aligned
coil could be effective for activating PNs. The spatial extent over which
the peak field exceeded the threshold extended for only ~75 mm from
the coil (Fig. 1A, top right) and therefore suggests that activation could
be confined to only a few nearby cells. For the orientation of the coil in
Fig. 1A, the component of the gradient that was parallel to the passing
axons of layers 1 and 4 (dEz/dz) was 0 V/m2 (Fig. 1A, bottom right),
suggesting that those axons or similarly oriented processes would not
be activated.
The coil shown in Fig. 1A is still considerably larger than existing
cortical implants, so we explored whether even smaller designs could
also generate suprathreshold fields and gradients. Consistent with
electromagnetic theory, the peaks in dEx/dx were localized to the
corners of the coil, that is, the regions containing sharp bends in the flow
of current, and therefore we considered the possibility that even a single
sharp bend of a wire might generate fields and gradients strong enough
for activation. Accordingly, we considered the design of Fig. 1B (left, red
thick trace). The 100-mm width of this coil would fit within a single cor-
tical column and would be comparable in size to existing electrode im-
plants, suggesting that it could be implanted safely into the cortex. The
peak strength of the field gradient calculated for this coil was 49 kV/m2
(Fig. 1B, middle and right panels), almost identical to that of the larger
single loop; the spatial extent over which the gradient exceeded the
threshold for the 1-mA stimulus was again narrowly confined,
extending only ~60 mm.
Although the spatially narrow regions of activation estimated in
Fig. 1 are highly attractive for applications in which focal activation
is required, it is well established that prolonged implantation into
the cortex induces a foreign body response that can lead to the for-
mation of a high-impedance glial sheath around the implant with a
resultant increase in distance to targeted neurons (11, 12). Migra-
tion of neurons away from the implant can also occur as part of the
foreign body response (22), and migration distances of ~75 mm were
reported even for implants that did not deliver stimulation. The
increased distance to viable neurons raises the possibility that the spa-
tially narrow fields and gradients arising from low-amplitude stimuli
may not extend far enough for the coil to remain effective following
prolonged implantation. We therefore examined how the spatial ex-
tent of the induced fields and gradients was altered by changes to the
amplitude of stimulation. We started by more closely examining the
profiles of fields and gradients for the same 1-mA stimulus used in
Fig. 1. One-dimensional plots of fields and vertical gradients (dEx/dx)
were generated for multiple sections through the coil in both the ver-
tical and horizontal directions (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively; the red
dashed line in each plot of gradients represents the previously reported
threshold level of 11,000 V/m2). The portions of the trace in which the
gradient exceeds the threshold provide an estimate of the approximate
extent over which activation would occur. Because activation will be
limited to only those regions that are external to the coil perimeter,
we restricted our focus to the region to the left of the blue dotted line
in Fig. 2A and outside the two blue dotted vertical lines in Fig. 2B. With
this approach, the extracted portion of dEx/dx along the x axis is plotted
in Fig. 2C (black) for a 1-mA stimulus, whereas the relevant portion of
dEx/dx along the y axis is plotted in Fig. 2D (black). We performed a
similar analysis for larger stimulus amplitudes (10, 25, 50, and 100 mA)
and overlaid the corresponding traces (red, blue, green, and pink, re-
spectively). Comparison of the individual plots reveals not only that
the suprathreshold region increases with amplitude but also that it is
asymmetric in the x and y directions; for example, for an amplitude
of 100 mA, the suprathreshold region extends ~151 mm along the x axis
and 414 mm along the y axis. To better visualize the full extent of this
region, we developed a two-dimensional contour plot for all ampli-
tudes (Fig. 2E). The plots confirm the sensitivity of this region to
changes in amplitude as well as the relatively wide spatial extent over
which the field gradient is suprathreshold for higher stimulus ampli-
tudes. Note that even the largest stimulus amplitude used in Fig. 2 is
well below the levels used in the original in vitro (13) and in vivo stu-
dies (23). Thus, the model results suggest that implanted microcoils
will be able to effectively activate neurons over a spatially extensive
region, for example, beyond the extent over which gliosis and cellular
migration occur. Because magnetic fields pass readily through even
high-impedance materials, the ability of implanted coils to reach
these more distant regions may not be adversely affected, even by se-
vere gliosis, the way that they can with electrodes.
Fabrication of microcoil probes and in vitro experiments
To verify that the new microcoils could activate cortical neurons, we
microfabricated the coil design of Fig. 1B for use in physiological
experiments (Materials and Methods; Fig. 3A). The coil consisted of a
copper trace (10 mm wide × 2 mm thick) on a silicon substrate that had a
cross-sectional area of 50 mm × 100 mm and a length of 2000 mm. The
coil assembly had a dc resistance of ~15 ohms and was insulated with
300 nm of SiO2 (Materials and Methods) to prevent the leakage of
electric current into the tissue. A second, similarly sized microcoil

 was also constructed by carefully bending a 50-mm-diameter copper
wire (Fig. 3B). Although this second coil did not have as sharp a bend
as the microfabricated coil, the thicker cross-sectional area of the wire
allowed stronger currents. Five-micrometer polyurethane/polyamide
insulation prevented the leakage of electrical current from this second
coil into the bath or tissue. Its resistance was ~13 ohms.
Fabricated microcoils were first tested for their ability to activate
cortical neurons during in vitro experiments using coronal brain slices
from mice (Materials and Methods; Fig. 3, C to K). A loose-seal cell-
attached patch-clamp electrode was positioned on the soma of a tar-
geted layer 5 (L5) PN within the whisker (motor) cortex and used to
record action potentials elicited by magnetic stimulation from the
microcoil (Materials and Methods). Patch-clamp recordings have
proven effective for allowing visualization of elicited action potentials
in previous studies with electric stimulation because the amplifiers are
not saturated by the stimulus; for example, the electrical artifact asso-
ciated with the stimulus does not preclude observation of neuronal
responses (24, 25). The coil was positioned close to the targeted cell

 with the tip centered over the proximal axon, the portion of the cell
that was thought to have the highest sensitivity to stimulation (26, 27).
To ensure that observed responses arose from direct activation of the
cell itself, that is, not secondary to activation of one or more presynaptic
neurons, we added 10 mM 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]
quinoxaline (NBQX), 10 mM bicuculline, and 50 mM D-2-amino-5-
phosphonopentanoic acid (D-APV) to the perfusion bath in some
experiments to block synaptic input to the cell. Stimulation at
relatively low amplitude levels produced an electrical artifact that con-
sisted of a short-duration biphasic waveform that persisted for ~0.4 ms
(Fig. 3C, top left). Increasing the amplitude of stimulation slightly
produced a similar artifact but now continued into a more prolonged
waveform (Fig. 3C, top right). The addition of 1 mM tetrodotoxin (TTX)
to the bath eliminated the prolonged part of the response (Fig. 3C,
bottom right, red trace), suggesting that it was an action potential,
and subtraction of the response in TTX from the corresponding control
response revealed a waveform (blue trace) that was highly similar to
those action potentials that arose spontaneously. Elicited action poten-
tials could also be extracted from the raw recordings (without the use of
TTX) by subtracting responses that contained the artifact only from
those that contained an artifact plus an action potential (Fig. 3D, black);
this process revealed a waveform that again had amplitude and kinetics

 that were nearly identical to those from a spontaneous action potential
(Fig. 3D, green trace). This suggests that the direct subtraction method
for identifying action potentials is comparably effective to the use of
TTX. Together, these experiments indicate that magnetic stimulation
from microcoils can elicit action potentials through direct activation
of L5 PNs.
To explore the ability of the coils to selectively target neurons, we
ran experiments in which the orientation of the coil was varied relative
to the orientation of the targeted PN. Initially, the plane of the coil was
held perpendicular to the surface of the slice (Fig. 3E, top), resulting in
a weak electric field and gradient along the length of the neuron. As
expected, this configuration was not effective (Fig. 3F, top), even for
the strongest amplitude that could be delivered by our system. The coil
was then reoriented with its flat surface approximately parallel to the
slice surface (Fig. 3E, bottom); this orientation is similar to that which
would arise during insertion of the microcoil into the intact cortex and

 resulted in a strong gradient along the length of the neuron that led to
robust spiking (Fig. 3F, bottom); note that the presence of the positive-
going after-hyperpolarization that closely follows each stimulus pro-
vides a clear marker for the presence of an elicited action potential
(24). With direct activation, individual stimuli could each induce a
single action potential at even the fastest rates tested (up to 100 Hz;
n = 11 of 11; Fig. 3F, bottom). Similar to electric stimulation, stronger
levels of magnetic stimulation increased the likelihood that a given
pulse would elicit a spike (Fig. 3G, left; n = 7) and revealed thresholds
of 44.21 ± 7.31 mA (SD) for direct activation. The sensitivity to stim-
ulation in these cells was not significantly affected by the addition of
synaptic blockers to the perfusion bath (Fig. 3G, right; n = 4). The ability
to extract and visualize individual spikes also allowed the timing of in-
dividual spikes to be precisely determined and revealed onset latencies
of ≤1.0 ms (Fig. 3H). As expected from spikes that are directly activated,
latencies were not sensitive to the addition of synaptic blockers (Fig. 3I).
Repositioning the coil such that its tip was over the apical dendrite
of the targeted neuron (Fig. 3J) allowed the sensitivity of this portion of
the neuron to be explored as well. Once again, orienting the plane of
the coil perpendicular to the slice surface (Fig. 3J, top) resulted in very
weak electric fields along the neuron and did not produce spiking
(Fig. 3K, top). However, alignment of the coil parallel to the surface
of the slice (Fig. 3J, bottom) produced robust spiking (n = 8; Fig. 3K,
bottom). The onset latencies of spikes elicited by stimulation over the
apical dendrite were not well correlated to individual stimuli and were
typically ≥3 ms, suggesting that spikes were mediated through the
activation of the surrounding neural network. The addition of phar-
macological blockers of excitatory synaptic input to the perfusion bath
[10 mM CNQX (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxalene-2,3-dione) and 50 mM
D-APV] eliminated these responses, thereby confirming their pre-
synaptic origin. The thresholds for indirect activation were 46.50 ±
11.78 mA (SD), and therefore both modes of activation had similar
thresholds. Consistent with previous electric stimulation studies
(6, 28, 29), it was not possible to elicit an individual action potential
for each stimulus via indirect activation, even at the highest stimulus
amplitudes. We did not attempt to identify the specific presynaptic
neuron(s) activated by stimulation over the apical dendrite, but the
high sensitivity of L5 PNs to vertically oriented electric fields raises
the possibility that another vertically oriented neuron is activated;
L2/3 PNs are an obvious possibility, especially because they are known
to make excitatory synapses to L5 PNs. It is, of course, possible that
multiple neuronal types are activated by stimulation from the micro-
coil, and further testing will be required to identify the specific types
activated as well as to elucidate the subsequent synaptic interactions
that occur.
For direct activation, thresholds were generally lowest when the
tip of the coil was situated over the proximal axon at a distance of
~50 mm from the soma. Previous studies with electric stimulation have
shown that the threshold for direct activation is minimized when the
electrode is precisely centered over the dense band of sodium channels
within the spike initiation zone of the proximal axon (26, 30), and it is
likely that the lowest thresholds here arise because of the proximity
to this location. However, we did not typically expend the consid-
erable time and effort required to determine the exact location at
which threshold is minimized (26), and so the 44.21-mA value re-
ported here may not represent the absolute minimum threshold
that can be obtained. For indirect activation, thresholds were gener-
ally lowest when the coil was over the apical dendrite at a distance of
~200 mm from the soma, although once again we did not systemati-
cally attempt to find the location for which threshold was minimized.
Despite the fact that the values obtained here do not necessarily repre-
sent the absolute minimum thresholds, the levels that are reported
here are still considerably lower than those reported with the previous
microcoil for in vitro activation (13, 19). For example, previous work
with the original microcoil (inductor) required thresholds of 717 mA
for activation (13), whereas the thresholds for in vitro activation here
were 44.21 mA (~16× reduction; see fig. S1 for further comparison
of power levels). The lower threshold levels that were observed here
likely arose because the smaller size of the coil not only generated
stronger fields but also allowed for closer proximity to targeted neu-
rons. Note also that for the responses that arose through indirect
activation (Fig. 3K, bottom), the electrical artifact arising from the
stimulus was quite small. This is consistent with the spatially nar-
row extent of the induced electric fields (Fig. 2) versus the relatively
large separation between the coil and the recording electrode. Minimi-
zation of the stimulus artifact is a highly attractive feature, especially
for efforts in which it is essential to record the response to artificial
stimulation (31).
To better explore the spatial extent of magnetic stimulation as well
as its ability to selectively activate specific orientations, we ran an ad-
ditional series of experiments using brain slices from GCaMP6 mice
(Materials and Methods). Cortical PNs from these animals express a
calcium indicator that increases its level of fluorescence in response to
spiking; similar to previous reports (32, 33), we observed low levels of
fluorescence in the somas of individual L5 PNs (Fig. 4, A and C).
Before measuring the responses to magnetic stimulation, we first
examined the responses that arose from electric stimulation delivered
via a conventional implantable electrode (Materials and Methods). At
low levels of stimulation, there was little change in fluorescence, but as
the amplitude of stimulation increased, the region over which fluores-
cence increased became progressively larger (Fig. 4B); this is consistent
with results from previous studies of electric stimulation in vivo (6). At
the highest level of stimulation tested here, a 200 mm × 200 mm region
of the slice was strongly activated and uniformly extended in all
directions. Similar to electric stimulation, low levels of magnetic stim-
ulation also produced little change in the level of fluorescence, and
higher levels resulted in increasing areas of activation (Fig. 4D). How-
ever, the spatial extent of activation was more narrowly confined with
magnetic stimulation, and the location over which cells were activated
was consistent with the predictions that arose from computational
modeling (Figs. 2 and 4F). Although the responses shown in Fig. 4
(B and D) reflect the fluorescence of both somas and the surrounding
neuropils (that is, axons and dendrites), the analysis could also be
restricted to evaluate fluorescence changes in somas only (6, 32, 33).
For the strongest stimulus tested here (52 mA), somas up to a distance
of 160 mm from the coil exhibited robust increases (DF/F > 5 to 10%)
in fluorescence (Fig. 4E), whereas smaller increases (DF/F > 1 to 3%)
in fluorescence were exhibited by cells even further away. Thus, con-
sistent with the modeling predictions of Fig. 2E, magnetic stimula-
tion from these coils can modulate activity well beyond the region
over which encapsulation and cell migration are expected to occur
(11, 22, 34, 35), thereby suggesting that these coils can remain viable
during chronic implantation.
To eliminate the possibility that nonmagnetic factors contributed to
the spiking responses observed here, we performed a series of control
experiments, similar to the ones performed with the larger microcoil in
earlier studies (13, 19). For example, the integrity of the coil insulation
was tested regularly by measuring the impedance to ground; values were

 typically ~1 gigohm and were always greater than 200 megohms, there-
by eliminating the possibility of direct electric stimulation contributing
to observed responses. We also monitored the temperature in the bath
as well as in the surrounding brain tissue during magnetic stimulation
and observed increases of less than 1°C, well below the threshold for
thermal activation of neurons (36–38). Capacitive currents can be
transmitted through the coil insulation and have previously been shown
to be effective for neuronal activation (39). However, there was no re-
turn electrode in the recording chamber in our experiments, and hence
currents were not “forced” through the tissue as they were in a previous
study (39). Although this greatly reduces the potential likelihood of ca-

 large transient current was used to “burn” a small portion of the coil,
thereby leaving an open circuit; the transient current was not strong
enough to also burn through the surrounding insulation, and thus there
remained no potential for direct electrical activation. The subsequent
delivery of stimulation to the “broken” coil produced a voltage differen-
tial across the open circuit, essentially acting as a capacitor. However,
this approach was not effective for eliciting neural activity and therefore
suggests that the observed responses were not mediated through capac-
itive activation. Finally, to eliminate the possibility that one or more
(noncoil) hardware elements from our experimental setup might be
generating the fields that are responsible for neuronal activation, care
was taken to leave all hardware components in a fixed position across
all experiments. In this manner, the only component that was not spa-
tially fixed across trials was the orientation of the coil relative to targeted
cells. Because some experiments induced neuronal responses whereas
others did not, it is unlikely that any of the noncoil hardware compo-
nents contributed meaningfully to activation, and we conclude that the
fields arising froman appropriately orientedmicrocoil were the primary
source of activation.
In vivo animal experiments
On the basis of the successful activation of PNs in vitro, we im-
planted the new coils into the whisker (motor) cortex of anesthetized
mice to explore whether they could also drive neuronal circuits in
vivo. Following a craniotomy and removal of the dura (Materials
and Methods), both coil designs (Fig. 3, A and B) could be easily
inserted into the cortex (n = 18 and 6, respectively). There was no
evidence of excessive bleeding or other complications during the
ensuing experiments (with durations of up to 2 hours). Coil tips were
inserted to a depth of approximately 500 mm, aligning the tip to the
highly sensitive proximal axon of L5 PNs and using the coil orien-
tation that was most effective with the in vitro experiments (Fig. 3C,
bottom). The whisker cortex was an attractive target to evaluate
in vivo efficacy because it allowed direct comparisons of results to
many earlier studies with implanted electrodes (40–42). For example,
analogous to the results with electric stimulation, the direction of
whisker movement was similarly sensitive to the frequency of
magnetic stimulation: 10-Hz stimulation of the whisker motor cortex
in the left hemisphere (5 pulses; Fig. 5A, left) reliably produced
protraction of the whiskers on the right side (Fig. 5B, top right, up-
ward deflections; n = 8 of 8), whereas 100-Hz stimulation (10 pulses;
Fig. 5A, right) caused retraction (Fig. 5B, bottom right, downward
deflections; n = 8 of 8). Also similar to electric stimulation responses,
the onset of whisker protraction in response to magnetic stimulation
was slower than the onset of whisker retraction (Fig. 5E; n = 5; t test,
P = 0.0008). Although elicited movements in the anesthetized animal
were small, they were comparable in magnitude to those elicited pre-
viously in anesthetized animals with electric stimulation (40, 42). In
some cases, we observed larger deflections as the anesthesia started
to wear off, although we did not attempt to quantify these differ-
ences. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with both coils.
To confirm that implantable coils were also effective for activat-
ing the sensory cortex, we also inserted coils into the barrel cortex
(Fig. 5C, left) and again examined the whisker movements evoked
by magnetic stimulation (Fig. 5, C and D). Both 10- and 100-Hz
stimulation caused whisker retraction only (Fig. 5C, right panels;
n = 5 of 5), consistent with the movements elicited by electric stim-
ulation (41). Together, these results provide strong evidence that the
new microcoils can effectively drive neuronal circuits in vivo. Further,
the strong parallels of the responses induced here by magnetic stimu-
lation to the responses described previously with electric stimulation
suggest that similar patterns of neural activity are elicited by each.
The thresholds for in vivo activation were 7 to 10 mA and were
therefore approximately one-fifth of those associated with in vitro acti-
vation. Once again, we did not systematically evaluate thresholds as a
function of the depth of insertion nor did we seek to determine whether
significantly shallower depths, for example, those that would position
the coil tip over the apical dendrite, would be more effective. Thus, fur-
ther reductions in threshold may be possible. In general, the thresholds
associated with the fabricated coils were slightly less than those made
from bent wires. However, we are hesitant to draw too strong a conclu-
sion here because the different coil designs may have biased placement
of one of the designs to a more sensitive portion of the neuron.
Low-power repetitive micromagnetic stimulation
Previous experiments with electric stimulation have demonstrated
that neuronal responses can be elicited by repetitive delivery of
low-amplitude stimuli, even when each stimulus by itself is sub-
threshold. As an example, hippocampal neurons can be activated
by field strengths of 0.14 V/m from stimuli delivered at 1 to 2 Hz
(43), although the threshold for activation of Purkinje and stellate
neurons with a single pulse is thought to be close to 10 V/m (44).
A similar finding with magnetic stimulation would be potentially
attractive because it might help to further reduce the power consump-
tion associated with these devices. We tested whether whisker move-
ments could be evoked by repetitive stimulation at rates ranging from
1 to 100 Hz while the amplitude was held fixed at the lowest level
we could deliver (11.2 mV, corresponding to a stimulus current of
0.75 mA). For a rate of 1 Hz, a single pulse was delivered every second
for a total duration of 10 s, whereas for all other rates (10, 50, and
100 Hz), three pulses were delivered every second for a duration of
5 s (the timing of different stimulus trains is depicted in Fig. 6A).
Low-amplitude stimulation induced small whisker movements (Fig. 6B)
that, similar to earlier experiments, reversed direction for higher rates
of stimulation (Fig. 6, B and C) (n = 8 of 8). We quantified the level of
movement by averaging the amplitude of whisker deflections during
stimulation and comparing it to the deflections that arose before and
after stimulation [Fig. 6C, averaged for 2 s before and 10 s after stim-
ulation (see Materials and Methods); n = 5; t test, P = 0.0001]. The
results reveal small but statistically significant movements that were
induced by these stimuli. Although the long latencies associated with
these responses will need to be overcome for this type of approach to
be practically useful, the results are nevertheless encouraging be-
cause they suggest that activation may be possible at very low
power levels.
DISCUSSION
Here, we showed that a new microcoil, comparable in size to elec-
trodes that are routinely implanted into the cortex, can effectively
activate neurons in vitro and also drive neural circuits in vivo. By using
a single sharp bend of a thin wire, a strong, local electric field gradient
that was well in excess of previous estimates of activation threshold
could be generated. This new design allowed the cross-sectional profile
of the implant to be reduced from 500 mm × 500 mm in the original
inductor to a 50 mm × 100 mm profile here; the smaller size allowed
coils to be safely inserted into the cortex instead of restricting place-
ment to noncortical regions as with previous microcoil designs (23).

 Physiological testing confirmed model predictions and showed not
only that microcoil stimulation can activate cortical neurons but also
that specific types of neurons can be selectively targeted. For example,
in vitro experiments showed strong activation when the induced
electric field was aligned along the length of the targeted PN but little
or no activation when the coil was rotated by 90°, for example, so that
the electric field and its gradient were orthogonal to the targeted neu-
ron. Similar to electric stimulation, even prolonged stimulation at high
amplitudes was not effective for this orientation. This suggests that
when the coil was inserted into the cortex for in vivo experiments, hor-
izontally oriented passing axons were subjected to minimal activation
force and likely remained unresponsive, whereas local PNs were
strongly activated. It has been shown that incidental activation of pass-
ing axons by electric stimulation causes the response to a given stim-
ulus to spread well beyond the local region surrounding the electrode
(6–8). The spread of activation is undesirable because it reduces the
effectiveness of stimulation; for example, both the potential acuity that
can be achieved with a prosthesis that targets the visual cortex and the
ability of a brain-computer interface to provide precise feedback sig-
nals to the primary somatosensory cortex are diminished. Thus, the
ability of coil-based magnetic stimulation to activate vertically oriented
PNs without simultaneously activating horizontally oriented passing
axons may help to better confine activation to only local neurons
and may lead to more effective stimulation. Further testing will be
required to establish whether other, nonpyramidal, vertically oriented
neuronsoraxons are also activatedby coils and to determine the relative
sensitivity of each. Despite the uncertainty in identifying the underlying
mechanism of activation, the strong similarities in behavioral responses
to magnetic versus electric stimulation suggest that the underlying
neuronal responses may be similar for the two modalities.
Analogous to the use of electric stimulation, the volume of neurons
activated by microcoils could be altered by changes to the amplitude of
stimulation as well as by the design of the coil itself. At low stimulus
amplitudes, activation could be confined to those neurons within ~60 mm
of the coil tip. This translates to a volume of ~0.0001 mm3; using a pre-
vious estimate of neuronal density in mouse M1 [74,775 cells/mm3
(45)] results in activation of eight cells with the 1-mA stimulus. For
comparison, the volume of tissue activated by a 50-mA stimulus was
estimated to be 0.009 mm3, resulting in activation of 676 cells.
We also estimated the volume of activation in our in vitro ex-
periments by systematically stepping the coil away from a targeted cell
at a given stimulus strength. These experiments led to qualitatively
similar values to those estimated from the model; for example, the
50-mA stimulus remained effective within a distance of ~150 mm to

 the cell—approximately the same as that predicted by the model. Fur-
ther confirmation of this estimate comes from the calcium imaging
experiments; for example, the zone of activation extended ~160 mm
from the coil for a 52-mA stimulus. This ability to extend the region
of activation will be important for chronic implants given the prev-
alence of glial scarring that can surround implants (11, 12) as well
as the potential for migration of cells away from the implant (22, 35).
The properties of the induced electric fields from coils may remain
more consistent over time because magnetic fields pass readily
through the high-impedance glial encapsulation that can surround
implants although encapsulation can markedly alter the strength as well
as the spatial distribution of the electric fields arising from electrodes. In
addition, the lack of direct metal-to-brain contact for coils eliminates
many of the electrode-brain interface problems, for example, the vari-
ability of electrode impedance following implantation (9, 15).
The results of this study suggest that power consumption,
defined as the product of current-squared and impedance, will
not preclude the use of microcoils in acute or chronic studies.
The current levels associated with magnetic stimulation are typical-
ly higher than those associated with electric stimulation, whereas
the impedance of coils is typically many orders of magnitude lower
(for example, 20 ohms versus 1 megohm). Thus, to a first approx-
imation, the currents required for coils can be two to three orders
of magnitude greater than those from electrodes but still result in a
similar level of power consumption. Of course, many additional
factors influence power usage, and higher current levels may re-
quire specialized power supplies, but this estimate suggests that
the higher levels of current will not necessarily result in excessive
power levels.
The new coil design was associated with a considerable reduction
in thresholds (power levels are summarized in fig. S1). For example,
the threshold for single-pulse activation of L5 PNs in brain slices was
40 to 45 mA, nearly 16× lower than the thresholds obtained in anal-
ogous experiments with the original coil. This translates to a reduction
in power from ~2 W to ~10 mW. Thresholds for in vivo activation
with the new coil were even lower (7 to 10 mA) and brought estimated
power levels down to 0.4 mW, a reduction of more than two orders of
magnitude from those required in previous in vivo experiments with
the original microcoil (13). It is almost certain that a large portion of
the reduction in in vivo thresholds arises from the ability to insert the
new design directly into the cortex, whereas the previous design
restricted coil placement to the cortical surface.
Although the estimates here are still preliminary, it is nevertheless
encouraging that they compare favorably to the levels for existing clin-
ical devices; for example, power levels for deep brain stimulation im-
plants range from 2 to 24.5 mW (fig. S1). Power levels from the new
microcoils also compare favorably to those associated with electric
stimulation of the motor cortex in vivo [0.5 mW (40)]. However,
coil-based power levels still exceed those from electric stimulation
of the sensory cortex (0.002 to 0.05 mW). Some of this difference
may reflect a higher sensitivity of the sensory cortex versus that of
the motor cortex (46–49), and thus further testing in visual cortical
neurons may lead to further reductions in power. Regardless, the
power levels associated with stimulation from microcoils have
dropped several orders of magnitude since the introduction of the
original coil and are likely to drop further given the rapid evolution
of this technology.
In addition to reducing power levels, it is likely that the size and
selectivity of microcoils will continue to be further optimized. Even

 relatively simple enhancements, such as incorporating multiple sharp-
bend wires at the same location, are likely to enhance the strength of
stimulation. Other design enhancements, such as the use of multiple
wires at different depths within the same probe shank, may allow se-
lective targeting of neurons at different depths; for example, those PNs
of L2/3 and of L5 could each be activated independently. This ap-
proach might help to better re-create physiological signaling patterns
with a prosthesis. It is also likely that the relatively simple bends that
were used here can be enhanced to further optimize both the efficacy
of stimulation and the orientation selectivity, that is, double bends in
the tip (forming a “w” shape) may prove to be even more selective
than the simple bends that were used here. The use of materials that
enhance magnetic field strength (for example, ferrite, mu-metal, and
permalloy) may also help to further increase the efficacy of stimula-
tion with a corresponding reduction in power levels. Finally, the use
of nanometer-scale wires may help to further reduce coil size without
a significant loss in efficacy. The combination of selective targeting,
increased reliability, and power levels that are comparable to or may-
be even less than those of existing devices raises the possibility that
implanted microcoils may provide a highly attractive alternative to
existing electrode-based approaches for cortical stimulation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Modeling of microcoils
Custom software, written in MATLAB, was used to calculate the
spatial gradient of induced electric fields (E-fields) that arose from
the flow of current through a microcoil (13, 19).
From Faraday’s laws, the E-field, E
→ , is related to the time-varying
magnetic field by

Because the magnetic field,B

the magnetic vector potential, A

→ ¼ ∇ � A

E-field can be expressed as
E
→ ¼ � ∂A
→
∂t � ∇V

Under the assumptions that there is no charge on the coil and that
the current distribution in the coil is uniform (that is, quasi-static
condition), ∇V is equal to 0 and Eq. 2 becomes

where m0 is the permeability constant, N is the number of turns, i is
the electric current through the coil, R is the vector between the coil
segment and the target segment at which the E-field is calculated, and
dl is the small segment of the coil.
Because the principal axis of the PNs within each cortical col-
umn was approximately parallel to the x axis (compare Fig. 1), the
E-field along the cortical column can be calculated by numerical
integration along the length of the coil loop.

In the above equation, the coil element lies at (x0,y0,z0) and the

Ex
→ from Eq. 6. The input current to the coil, i , was a half-period of a
3-kHz sinusoidal waveform with an amplitude of 1 mA (13, 19).
Two types of microcoilswere considered and modeled. The first type
was a square loop (500 mm per side) that was essentially a single loop
extracted from the inductor used in previous studies (Fig. 1A) (13). The
second type was an asymmetric trapezoid-shaped loop that was 1000 mm
long and 100 mm wide; the width tapered down to 50 mm at the tip (Fig.
1B). The trapezoid-shaped loop coil was highly similar to the silicon mi-
croprobe coil that was used in subsequent physiological experiments.
Fabrication and testing of microcoils
The microcoil fabrication process was based on silicon processing
techniques. First, a 50-mm-thick, 4-inch-diameter silicon wafer was
bonded to a handling wafer with an adhesive. Subsequently, a 100-
to 200-nm-thick SiO2 layer was deposited using plasma-enhanced
chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Then, a 2-mm-thick copper layer
was sputtered using electron beam (e-beam)–assisted physical vapor
deposition with a 10-nm-thin titanium layer to improve adhesion.
Next, a photoresist, used as a mask for the next etching step, was
spin-coated and baked. The photoresist was patterned by exposure to
ultraviolet light through a phase-shifting photomask. After that, the
copper was wet-etched using a solution of Transene Copper Etchant
49-1. The photoresist was stripped off in acetone, and then 300 nm
of insulating SiO2 was deposited on top using PECVD. The area
of the electrical contact pads was shadowed to ensure that it
was free of the top insulation. Following this step, a photoresist,
used as the mask in the silicon etch, was spin-coated and pat-
terned. The 50-mm-thick silicon substrate was etched through
using deep reactive ion etching. The resulting microcoil structures
(Fig. 3A) were then released from the handling wafer in acetone
and dried. We also made a microcoil using an ultrafine copper
wire [50-mm bare diameter (45-AWG), polyurethane base coat,
polyamide overcoat, 60 mm with insulation; Essex] (Fig. 3B).

 The fabricated coils were assembled with copper wire leads (34-
AWG, polyurethane inner coat and nylon overcoat) (Belden). The
electrical contacts of the microcoils were connected to the copper wire
leads using a silver conductive epoxy (CircuitWorks Conductive Ep-
oxy, ITW Chemtronics). Assembled coils were mounted on a custom-
made plastic holder with an instant adhesive, and the distal ends of the
copper wire leads were attached to the signal and ground leads of a
BNC (Bayonet Neill–Concelman) connector. The custom-made as-
semblies were secured to the micromanipulator of a stereotaxic frame
(Model 900, David Kopf Instruments) for accurate positioning over
the mouse cortex.
Each microcoil assembly was tested both before and after each
experiment to ensure that there was no leakage of electrical current
from the coil into the mouse cortex (19). Coils were submerged in
physiological solution (0.9% NaCl), and the impedance between
one of the coil terminals and an electrode immersed in the physi-
ological solution was measured before and after each in vivo animal
experiment. Impedances above 200 megohms were considered in-
dicative of adequate insulation. The high impedance ensured that
direct electrical currents did not contribute to any of the elicited
neural activity underlying observed mouse behaviors.
Micromagnetic stimulation drive
The output of a function generator (AFG3021B, Tektronix Inc.) was
connected to a 1000-W audio amplifier (PB717X, Pyramid Inc.) with a
gain of 5.6 V/V and a bandwidth of 70 kHz. The audio amplifier was
powered by a battery (LC-R1233P, Panasonic Corp.). The output of the
amplifier was monitored with an oscilloscope (TDS2014C, Tektronix
Inc.). A stimulation pulse consisted of a single full-period 3-kHz sinus-
oid waveform. The amplitude of sinusoids from the function generator
ranged from 0 to 200 mV. The output of the amplifier for sinusoids was
0 to 1.12 V. Single-burst stimulation (Fig. 5A) consisting of 5 or 10
pulses was delivered at 10 and 100 Hz, respectively. Repetitive stimula-
tion at 1 pulse/s was delivered for a total of 10 s. Other repetitive stimula-
tions consisted of 3 pulses/s at 10, 50, or 100 Hz for a total duration of 5 s.
In vitro brain slice experiments
Electrophysiological recordings were performed using brain slices
prepared from 17- to 30-day-old mice (C57BL/6J; The Jackson Labo-
ratory). The care and use of animals followed all federal and institu-
tional guidelines, the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees
of the Boston Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System, and the Sub-
committee on Research Animal Care of the Massachusetts General
Hospital. The mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and de-
capitated. The brains were removed immediately after death, and a
section of the brain containing the whisker M1 (0.5 to 1 mm anterior
to the bregma) was isolated on ice in a 0° to 5°C oxygenated solution
containing 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 2.5 mM KCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM
MgCl2, 25 mM glucose, and 225 mM sucrose, equilibrated with 95% O2–
5% CO2 (pH 7.4). This cold solution, with a low sodium ion and
without calcium ion content, improved tissue viability. In the same
medium, 300- to 400-mm-thick coronal slices were prepared using a
vibrating blade microtome (Vibratome 3000 Plus, Ted Pella Inc.) and
were incubated at room temperature in an aCSF solution containing
125 mM NaCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 2.5 mM KCl, 25 mM NaHCO3,
1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, and 25 mM glucose, equilibrated with
95% O2–5% CO2 (pH 7.4). After a 2-hour recovery period, slices that
contained M1 were transferred and mounted, caudal side down, to a
plastic recording chamber (RC-27L, Warner Instruments, LLC) with a
plastic slice anchor (SHD-27LP/2, Warner Instruments, LLC). The
chamber was maintained at 30° ± 2°C and continuously superfused
(3.3 ml/min) with oxygenated aCSF solution.
Whisker M1 L5 PNs were targeted under visual control. Spiking
was recorded with a patch electrode (4 to 8 megohms) that was
filled with superfusate and positioned onto the surface of a targeted
PN [a loose-seal (15- to 20-megohm) cell-attached mode]. The patch-
clamp amplifier was a MultiClamp 700B Amplifier (Molecular De-
vices) operated in voltage-clamp mode with a holding potential (that
is, command potential) of 0 mV or similar levels at which the amplifier
current Iamp is 0 pA. Recording somatic action potentials in this mode is
thought to capture the capacitive charging current (Cm·dV/dt), and so
waveforms reflect the derivative of voltage over time instead of voltage
versus time but nevertheless provide an accurate indicator of somatic
spiking (24, 50–54). The use of voltage-clamp mode results in the
capture of the currents underlying the action potential and therefore
depolarizations are reflected by downward deflections (inward currents),
followed by upward, hyperpolarizing currents. Two silver chloride–
coated wires served as the ground and were positioned at opposite edges
of the recording chamber, each approximately 15 mm from the targeted
cell. The microcoil assembly was fixed in the micromanipulator such that
the plane of the coil was held either perpendicular or parallel to the top
surface of the slice (compare Fig. 3E). The coil assembly was lowered
into the bath until the coil was 50 mm above the targeted PN.
In some experiments, 10 mMCNQX(or 10 mM NBQX) and/or 50 mM
D-AP5 or D-APV was added to the perfusion bath to block AMPA/
kainate and NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) channels, respectively.
Both drugs were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corp. The GABAA
(g-aminobutyric acid type A) receptor antagonist (+)-bicuculline
(10 mM; Tocris Bioscience) was used to block inhibitory synaptic trans-
mission. TTX (1 mM; EMD Millipore Corp.) was used to block action
potentials. Drugs were prepared daily from concentrated stock solu-
tions; deionized water was added to dilute stock solutions to the appro-
priate concentration shortly before application.
Calcium fluorescence imaging and analysis
Calcium fluorescence imaging was performed using brain slices
prepared from 17- to 30-day-old transgenic mice (Thy1-GCaMP6f;
The Jackson Laboratory). The care and use of animals followed all
federal and institutional guidelines, the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committees of the Boston VA Healthcare System, and the Sub-
committee on Research Animal Care of the Massachusetts General
Hospital. The brain slices were prepared and maintained using the
same methods described above and were then incubated in a dark
room at room temperature in the aCSF solution. After a 2-hour re-
covery period, slices that contained the primary visual cortex (V1)
were transferred and mounted, caudal side down, to the plastic re-
cording chamber (RC-27L) with a plastic slice anchor (SHD-27LP/2).
Imaging was performed with a Nikon Eclipse FN1 microscope
(Nikon Instruments Inc.) through a 20× 0.5 numerical aperture ob-
jective (Nikon Fluor 20× /0.50 water immersion objective). The
excitation light source (X-Cite 120Q; Excelitas Technologies Corp.)
was coupled to the epifluorescent port of the microscope. Calcium
fluorescence changes were captured with a charge-coupled device
camera (DFK 31BU03.H; USB 2.0 color industrial camera; 1024 ×
768 pixels; 30 frames/s; The Imaging Source, LLC). The actual
imaging area was 267 mm × 200 mm.
Calcium fluorescence transients in V1 L5 PNs were first evoked
by electrical stimulations with 200-ms, 0- to 30-mA cathodic first

 biphasic current pulses (that is, 100 pulses were delivered at a repeti-
tion rate of 100 Hz) through a 1-megohm platinum-iridium (Pt-Ir)
microelectrode (Microprobes for Life Science) positioned in L4 or
L5 (Fig. 4, A and B). Each electric stimulus was delivered three to
five times, and calcium transients from each trial were averaged.
Microcoils were then positioned in L4 or L5, and calcium fluo-
rescence transients were evoked by magnetic stimulations with a
single period of a sinusoidal waveform; the input current amplitude
ranged from 0 to 74 mA. One hundred pulses were typically
delivered at a repetition rate of 100 Hz. Microcoils were made of
25-mm-diameter Pt-Ir wires with 4-mm-thick polytetrafluoroethylene
insulation (A-M Systems) (Fig. 4, C and D). Magnetic stimulation
was repeated three to five times, and calcium transients were averaged
to determine the response.
Images were recorded using image capture software (IC Capture;
The Imaging Source, LLC) and processed using image analysis
software (ImageJ; National Institutes of Health). Calcium fluores-
cence transients for individual PNs were extracted using methods de-
scribed previously (32, 33). Briefly, outlines of individual PNs were
defined to create ROIs, and the cellular calcium transients were
calculated by averaging the pixels within each ROI. Calcium transients
for neuropil within a 20-mm annular-shaped region surrounding each
neuron were also extracted for correction of neuropil contamination
(33). True fluorescence transients from a neuron (cell body) were
estimated using the following equation: Fcell_true(t) = Fcell_apparent(t) −
r × Fsurrounding_neuropil(t), where t is the time and r is the contamination
ratio [r = 0.7 was chosen for the 20× objective in this study (32, 33)].
After the neuropil correction, the calcium fluorescence transients for
individual neurons were calculated as DF/F (%) = (F − F0)/F0, where F0
was the baseline fluorescence level calculated by averaging over 2 s
before the onset of stimulation.
In vivo animal experiments
All experiments were performed using mice that were 2 to 4 months
old (C57BL/6J; The Jackson Laboratory). The care and use of animals
followed all federal and institutional guidelines, the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committees of the Boston VA Healthcare
System, and the Subcommittee on Research Animal Care of the
Massachusetts General Hospital. Mice were deeply anesthetized with
a cocktail of ketamine hydrochloride (100 mg/kg intraperitoneal
injection) and xylazine (10 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection) before the
start of surgery. Additional ketamine (1/10 initial dose) was supplemen-
ted every 30 min to maintain the plane of anesthesia.
Anesthetized mice were placed into a stereotaxic frame (David
Kopf Instruments) for the craniotomy as well as all subsequent test-
ing. A heating blanket on the floor of the frame was used to maintain
body temperature at 37°C (rectally monitored). Lidocaine (2 mg/kg,
subcutaneously) was injected into the scalp, and a midline incision
was made, followed by removal of the portion of the skull and dura
overlying the motor cortex and/or the sensory cortex. Microcoils
were implanted into the whisker motor cortex (0.5 to 1 mm anterior
and 0.2 mm lateral to the bregma) or into the whisker sensory cortex
(1 to 2 mm posterior and 2 mm lateral to the bregma). Coils were
inserted to a depth of 500 mm unless otherwise specified.
Detection of whisker movements in anesthetized mice
We videotaped the whisker movements that arose in response to
magnetic stimulation using a high-definition web camera (LifeCam
HD-5000; Microsoft) so that quantification of movements could be
accurately determined. All the video files were captured at a rate of
30 frames/s, sufficient to detect the relatively slow whisker move-
ments. Video recording of the whisker movements started 2 s before
the onset of stimulation and ended 12 s after the end of stimulation.
Whisker movements for the 2-s period before the onset of stimula-
tion and the 2-s period that occurred 10 to 12 s after the termination
of the stimulus were used to calculate baseline (control) movements.
Stimulation generally evoked rhythmic whisker movements that per-
sisted for 3 to 5 s after the termination of the stimulus. Whisker tra-
jectories were generated from the raw video files using motion
tracking and analysis software (Kinovea, www.kinovea.org). Three
or five repetitions were averaged for each stimulation parameter.
Data analysis
In all statistical analyses, unpaired t tests were used to assess wheth-
er the difference between the average values for different stimula-
tion conditions was significant. Differences associated with P values
<0.05 were regarded as statistically significant. Variances are re-
ported as ±SD or ±SE.
