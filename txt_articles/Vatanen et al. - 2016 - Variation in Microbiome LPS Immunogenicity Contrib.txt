In Brief
Bacteroides species in the microbiota of
children from countries with high
susceptibility to autoimmunity produce a
type of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with
immunoinhibitory properties. These
properties may preclude early immune
education and contribute to the
development of type 1 diabetes.

SUMMARY
According to the hygiene hypothesis, the increasing
incidence of autoimmune diseases in western coun-
tries may be explained by changes in early microbial
exposure, leading to altered immune maturation. We
followed gut microbiome development from birth un-
til age three in 222 infants in Northern Europe, where
early-onset autoimmune diseases are common in
Finland and Estonia but are less prevalent in Russia.
We found that Bacteroides species are lowly abun-
dant in Russians but dominate in Finnish and
Estonian infants. Therefore, their lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) exposures arose primarily from Bacteroides
rather than from Escherichia coli, which is a potent
innate immune activator. We show that Bacteroides
LPS is structurally distinct from E. coli LPS and in-
hibits innate immune signaling and endotoxin toler-
ance; furthermore, unlike LPS from E. coli, B. dorei
LPS does not decrease incidence of autoimmune
diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice. Early coloniza-
tion by immunologically silencing microbiota may
thus preclude aspects of immune education.
INTRODUCTION
According to the hygiene hypothesis, early exposure to specific
microorganisms and parasites in infancy benefits immune system
development and confers protection against allergic and autoim-
mune diseases. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated a
global gradient in the incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D), multiple
sclerosis, and other autoimmune diseases in association with
improved sanitation and decreased incidence of early childhood
infections (reviewed in Bach, 2002; Bach and Chatenoud, 2012).
Similarly, rates of asthma and allergy are reduced in children
exposed to a farm environment (von Mutius and Vercelli, 2010).
One explanation for this effect posits that hygienic measures
meant to prevent infectious disease by removing microbes
from individuals’ living environments may, in turn, alter the indige-
nous intestinal microbiota, eliminating microbes important for
educating the immune system (Bach, 2002; von Mutius and
842
Cell 165, 842–853, May 5, 2016 ª2016 Elsevier Inc.
 Vercelli, 2010). Accordingly, studies in mouse models have shown
that early colonization with a protective microbiota can diminish
the risk of autoimmune diabetes development in genetically sus-
ceptible animals (Markle et al., 2013). Likewise, the composition
of the microbiota can protect mice from allergies (Stefka et al.,
2014). However, the distinction between beneficial and harmful
microbial communities andthe functional mechanisms underlying
their effects are still poorly understood.
A microcosm of the global gradient in immune disease inci-
dence occurs at the border between Finland and Russian Karelia,
where there is a 2- to 6-fold higher incidence of allergies (Seiskari
et al., 2007) and a 5- to 6-fold higher incidence of T1D and other
autoimmune disorders (Kondrashova et al., 2008a, 2008b) in
Finland relative to Russian Karelia. In nearby Estonia, coinciding
with economic development and improvement in living stan-
dards, the incidence of T1D and atopy has been transitioning
in recent decades from rates similar to those of Russian Karelia
toward those of Finland (Teea
¨ a
¨ r et al., 2010; Voor et al., 2005).
Using these three populations as a ‘‘living laboratory,’’ the
DIABIMMUNE study (http://www.diabimmune.org/) recruited a
total of �1,000 infants from Espoo (Finland), Petrozavodsk
(Russia), and Tartu (Estonia). The infants were followed from birth
to 3 years of age by monthly stool sampling along with collection
of extensive clinical metadata. The cohort thus provides, to date,
the largest longitudinal functional profile of the infant gut micro-
biome in relation to immune-mediated diseases, supplying an
unprecedented opportunity to understand the microbial ecology
and molecular mechanisms potentially underlying the hygiene
hypothesis (Peet et al., 2012).
To characterize host-microbe immune interactions contributing
to autoimmunity and allergy, we performed a longitudinal metage-
nomic characterization in 785 gut microbial communities from in-
fants in the DIABIMMUNE cohort selected for this study (Figures
1A and 1B). Using strain-level microbial identification, we uncov-
ered substantial differences in the composition, diversity, and sta-
bility of the early gut microbiome in Russian, Finnish, and Estonian
children. We further quantified the functional potential of these
microbial communities, stratifying gene families and pathways
across their contributing organisms. This extensive dataset con-
stitutes a valuable resource for infant gut microbiome investiga-
tions and is accessible through the DIABIMMNUNE Microbiome
Web site at http://pubs.broadinstitute.org/diabimmune.
In this work, we bridge deep human longitudinal metagenomic
analysis with the identification of novel molecular immune mech-
anisms (Figure 1C). After extensive analysis of this dataset, we
discovered that Finnish and Estonian infants harbored both a
greater proportion of Bacteroides species and enrichment in
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis-encoding genes, when
compared to Russian infants. Our investigations revealed that
these Bacteroides species produced a structurally and function-
ally distinct form of LPS; this LPS differed from the dominating
form of LPS in the early Russian microbiome that was almost
exclusively derived from E. coli. We further experimentally
demonstrated that LPS from Bacteroides dorei, previously
associated with T1D pathogenesis (Davis-Richardson et al.,
2014), harbored tetra- and penta-acylated lipid A structures, as
opposed to the hexa-acylated lipid A seen in E. coli. Furthermore,
B. dorei LPS inhibited immune stimulation and inflammatory
cytokine responses to E. coli LPS in human cells. These findings
suggest that differences in microbiota-derived LPS may preclude
aspects of immune education in Finnish and Estonian children,
uncovering one potential mechanism linking the human gut
microbiome to susceptibility to immune diseases.
RESULTS
Study Cohort
A subcohort of 74 infants from each country was selected on
the basis of similar histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)
risk class distribution and matching gender (Figures 1A and
1B; Table S1). For each infant, 3 years of monthly stool samples
and questionnaires regarding breastfeeding, diet, allergies, in-
fections, family history, use of drugs, clinical examinations, and
laboratory assays were collected. In accordance with the recruit-
ment criteria for the DIABIMMUNE cohort, all subjects had
increased HLA-conferred susceptibility to autoimmunity (Fig-
ure 1B) (Larizza et al., 2012; Sollid and Thorsby, 1993). Although
these children were only followed until 3 years of age and it was
therefore unlikely to see indications of allergic disease or autoim-
munity, laboratory examinations revealed a high prevalence of
allergen-specific sensitization and seropositivity for T1D-associ-
ated antibodies in Finnish and Estonian infants (Figure 1B,
bottom).
We also observed a gradient in T1D autoantibody seroposi-
tivity within the cohort with higher prevalence of T1D autoanti-
bodies in Finland. The number of infants that tested seropositive
for one or more T1D-associated autoantibodies was 16 for
Finland, 14 for Estonia, and 4 for Russia. Other studies in an older
population (7–15 years of age) have shown that children in
Russian Karelia display a substantially higher microbial exposure
than their Finnish peers, as denoted by higher prevalence of an-
tibodies against Helicobacter pylori (15-fold), Toxoplasma gondii
(5-fold), and hepatitis A virus (12-fold) (Seiskari et al., 2007). This
increased pathogen exposure in older children suggests an
overall higher exposure rate to diverse microorganisms, possibly
due to higher hygiene levels in urban Finland.
Regional Trends in the Gut Microbiota
To generate an overview of the composition of the gut microbiota
throughout the first three years of life, we sequenced the V4 re-
gion of the 16S rRNA gene from 1,584 samples (Figure S1) and
observed several strong high-level trends within this cohort.
Principal coordinate plots (Figure 2A) showed that, besides
age, country was the major source of variation, particularly dur-
ing the first year of life. To further confirm separability between
countries, we trained a set of random forest classifiers using
genus-level data from samples collected between 170 and
260 days of age. The classifier was able to predict country
with high-classification accuracy (area under the curve [AUC] =
0.944 for Finns versus Russians) (Figure 2B). Classification was
least accurate between Finns and Estonians (AUC = 0.546), sug-
gesting that early microbial profiles were fairly homogenous in
these two countries. Differences between the Russian samples
compared to Finnish and Estonian samples were already evident
at phylum-level composition (Figure 2C), represented by two
distinct hallmarks. First, Finnish and Estonian children had higher
Cell 165, 842–853, May 5, 2016
843
 levels of Bacteroidetes throughout the 3-year period (false dis-
covery rate [FDR] corrected p = 5.4 3 10�15; see the Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures). Second, Russians had higher
levels of the phylum Actinobacteria during the first year of life
(FDR corrected p = 0.014). The latter difference dissipated over
time and was no longer significant after two years of age. The
abundance of the phylum Bacteroidetes correlated with serum
insulin autoantibody (IAA) levels, both within Finland (p = 0.017)
and cohort-wide (p = 0.0020; Figure S2; Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures). We conducted extensive testing of asso-
ciations between the metadata and taxonomic groups using
MaAsLin, a linear modeling tool adapted for microbial commu-
nity data (Morgan et al., 2012). Hence, all reported country-level
differences were corrected for all major confounding effects,
such as birth mode, breastfeeding and other dietary factors,
antibiotics use, and age (see the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures). Table 1 highlights selected associations between
the metadata and microbiota. A comprehensive list of results,
including taxonomic differences between countries, taxonomic
alterations associated with allergen-specific immunoglobulin E
(IgE), and microbial changes associated with other collected
metadata, can be accessed at http://pubs.broadinstitute.org/
diabimmune.
The diversity of the microbiota within individual samples
(alpha diversity) increased with age (Figure S3A) as the micro-
biota developed toward an adult composition (Koenig et al.,
2011). However, Russians displayed a significantly less diverse
microbiota compared to Finns and Estonians during the first

 year (Figure S3B). This difference could be explained by the
2-fold overrepresentation of the phylum Actinobacteria and
the genus Bifidobacterium in the Russians for that time period
(Figures 2C and 2D). Lastly, we also uncovered differences in
stability within taxa between the countries. These differences
were particularly evident when comparing samples collected
during early and late time windows (Figures S3C and S3D).
Russians had an overall more plastic microbiota during the
first 3 years of life, with the exception of the most dominant
genus Bifidobacterium in the early time window. In contrast,
the phylum Bacteroidetes and the genus Bacteroides were
more stable in Finns and Estonians throughout the entire
observation period. Taken together, we uncovered strong
global differences between the Russian versus Finnish and
Estonian microbiota, with the largest differences occurring in
the first year and dissipating during the second and third
years.
Species- and Strain-Level Microbial Dynamics
To obtain a more complete and higher resolution taxonomic view
of the infants’ microbiome, we performed deep whole-genome
shotgun metagenomic sequencing on a representative subset
of 785 samples (Figure S1). We first investigated the metage-
nomic reads for their detailed taxonomic composition down to
the species level using MetaPhlAn (v.2.2) (Metagenomic Phylo-
genetic Analysis) (Truong et al., 2015) and observed multiple
differentially abundant species in the Bacteroides and Bifidobac-
terium genera between Finland and Russia (Figure 2D). Notably,
B. dorei, which has been previously associated with T1D patho-
genesis (Davis-Richardson et al., 2014), was the Bacteroides
species with the largest fold change between Finns and Rus-
sians. We confirmed the validity of the metagenomics data by
running qPCR on DNA from 85 stool samples. Interpolated
absolute abundances of B. dorei and E. coli species were in
good agreement with absolute abundances predicted by the

 metagenomics data when total bacterial mass was estimated
using universal 16S primers (Figure S3E; Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures).
Next, we analyzed the metagenomics data at the strain level
using ConStrains, a recently developed strain haplotyping tool,
and evaluated the diversity and stability of the infant microbiota
(Luo et al., 2015). In 60% of all strain profiles, communities were
composed of species with a single dominant strain (>90%
within-species abundance), as reflected in low within-species,
within-sample haplotype diversity scores (Figure S4A). However,
species in some genera, such as Faecalibacterium and Veillo-
nella, had bimodal haplotype diversity distributions, indicative
of more complex strain compositions. Moreover, strain diversity
had a tendency to increase with age (Figure S4B). Analysis of the
strain stability over time revealed that species tended to either
(1) remain stable, maintaining their single dominant strain, or
(2) experience a strain ‘‘sweep,’’ in which the original dominant
strain was replaced by a new dominant strain (Figure S4C). We
observed an inverse correlation between the longitudinal dis-
tance of the samples and the corresponding strain stability (Fig-
ure S4D). When comparing strain stability with average diversity
of the compared samples, we saw an inverse correlation, indi-
cating that less diverse strain profiles (i.e., single dominant strain
behavior) tended to be more stable compared to more diverse
strain profiles (Figure S4E). Within the genera of interest, we
observed that Bifidobacterium species failed to establish stable
single-strain communities in Finnish children, as shown by a
more evenly distributed strain diversity and stability compared
to Russians (Figures 2E and 2F). In contrast, Bacteroides species
(when present) tended to establish stable, single-strain compo-
sitions in both Finns and Russians (Figures 2E and 2F).
Differential Microbial Functions between Populations
To survey the functional and metabolic consequences of the
taxonomic differences between countries, we next analyzed
the metagenomic sequences for their genomic functional poten-
tial using HUMAnN2 (Abubucker et al., 2012) and linked quanti-
fied gene abundances (reads per kilobase per million reads
[RPKMs]) to gene ontology (GO) terms. As observed for microbial
diversity, functional diversity of the microbiome also started with
a less complex composition in Russians but developed to reach
greater diversity by the end of the 3-year period (Figure S5A). We
identified multiple GO categories with significantly different
abundances between Finns and Russians in both the early (first
year) and late (after first year) time windows (Figure 3A). For
instance, siderophore-related functions, which include iron
scavenging, as well as virulence-related functionalities, were
higher in Finnish infants, possibly reflecting an increase in path-
obiont organisms in Finland. A comprehensive list of differential
categories between the two countries is shown in Figure S5B
and Table S2.
Glycolytic functions were differentially abundant between
the two populations (Figure 3A), leading us to computation-
ally investigate differences in milk oligosaccharide metabolism.
The gut microbiome composition within the first year is largely
shaped by milk, the sole nutrient source available to infants,
whether from breast- or bottle-feeding (reviewed in Sela and
Mills, 2010). The Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides genera are

 the two main groups of human milk oligosaccharide (HMO)-
metabolizing bacteria (Marcobal et al., 2011). Within Bifidobac-
terium, B. bifidum and B. longum (predominant in Russians)
are capable of metabolizing HMOs, whereas B. breve (present
in Finns) is incapable of metabolizing intact HMOs, though it
readily utilizes monosaccharides liberated from HMOs (Locascio
et al., 2009). This observation led us to hypothesize that HMO
metabolism in Finnish and Estonian children is performed by
Bacteroides species, whereas it is performed by B. bifidum
and B. longum in Russians. Indeed, by analyzing the taxonomic
origin of genes belonging to a bona fide HMO gene cluster (Sela
et al., 2008), we showed that although the average abundance of
HMO utilization genes is approximately equal across the three
countries (mean ± SD in RPKM: Finland 460 ± 372, Estonia
462 ± 331, Russia 504 ± 469), most of the genes are conferred
by Bifidobacterium in Russians and Bacteroides in Finns and
Estonians (Figures 3B and S5C). We note that the higher abun-
dance of B. bifidum in Russians is not a result of increased
breastfeeding; Finnish infants were breastfed for a longer period
than Russians, on average (mean ± SD breastfeeding/days:
Finland 268 ± 149, Estonia 307 ± 217, Russia 199 ± 165).
Most significantly, we found that GO terms related to LPS
functions, LPS biosynthetic process (GO: 0009103), and lipid A
biosynthetic process (GO: 0009245) showed a striking difference
in abundance between countries (Figures 3A and 3C), indicating
that microbial communities in Finnish and Estonian subjects pro-
duced more LPS. This molecule is of particular interest because
it elicits a strong immune response in mammalian cells (Cullen
et al., 2015). When deconvoluting the species contributing to
biosynthesis of lipid A, the subunit responsible for the immu-
nostimulatory properties of LPS, we made two key observations.
In all three countries, E. coli was a major contributor to lipid A
biosynthesis, but in Finland and Estonia a number of other bac-
terial species contributed to lipid A biosynthesis potential, many
of which belong to the genus Bacteroides (Figures 3D and 3E).
LPS subtypes derived from Bacteroides species have been
shown to exhibit lower endotoxicity relative to LPS isolated
from other enteric bacteria (Hofstad et al., 1977). This finding

 prompted us to examine whether there was a difference in immu-
nogenicity of the LPS subtypes derived from the predominant
species of the three populations.
Contrasting Immunogenicity of LPS Subtypes
Inter-species differences in LPS structure are associated with al-
terations in their capacity to elicit an innate immune response
(Whitfield and Trent, 2014). Specifically, the lipid A domain of
LPS is responsible for immune signaling through recognition
and activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) complex (Kim
et al., 2007); as such, structural changes in lipid A impact recog-
nition by TLR4 and influence multiple facets of microbial ecology
(Cullen et al., 2015; Whitfield and Trent, 2014). We purified LPS
(see below) and used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ioniza-
tion-time of flight mass spectrometry (MS) to examine the struc-
ture of the lipid A domain of two bacterial species (type strains):
E. coli as a representative of the most common immunostimula-
tory lipid A structure and B. dorei, which was the most differ-
entially abundant Bacteroides species between the countries
(Figures 2D and 3D). Lipid A extracted from E. coli produced a
predominant peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 1798.3,
consistent with the published [M-H]� ion structure of E. coli
lipid A (Needham et al., 2013) carrying two phosphate groups
and six acyl chains (predicted exact mass: 1,797.2 m/z) (Fig-
ure 4A). Lipid A extracted from B. dorei produced two predomi-
nant peaks at m/z 1,690.9 and 1,436.2, consistent with the
[M-H]� ion structures with one phosphate group and four and
five acyl chains, respectively (predicted exact mass: 1,689.2
and 1,435.0 m/z) (Figure 4B).
In order to ensure that LPS from our B. dorei type strain
was representative of clinical samples, we isolated B. dorei
strains from stool samples of six healthy donors for comparative

vealed identical LPS structural features
across all B. dorei isolates (Figures S6A

B. dorei LPS structure and function are
likely to be recapitulated in patients.

studies have shown that the number of
acyl chains is a strong determinant of
immune activation by LPS (Hajjar et al.,
2002; Needham et al., 2013) and that
penta- and tetra-acylated lipid A struc-
tures elicit reduced TLR4 responses (Her-
ath et al., 2011). In order to understand
the consequences of the structural differ-
ences between the LPS subtypes, we
assessed the immunogenicity of LPS
derived from the bacterial species contributing to the LPS load
in our samples (see Figure 3E). Of the 15 strongest contributors,
we were able to purify LPS from 11 type strains listed in Table S3.
We first used the LPS purified from these strains to stimulate
primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs),
which contain LPS-responsive cell types similar to those present
in the gut and are thus a common proxy for mucosal leukocytes
(Ardeshir et al., 2014; Sokol et al., 2008). LPS derived from E. coli
produced a strong response as measured by the production
of the necrosis factor kB (NF-kB)-dependent cytokines inter-
leukin-10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), IL-1b,
and IL-6 in primary PBMCs (Figures 5A and S7A), whereas
LPS derived from B. dorei failed to elicit any response regardless
of the dose. Notably, LPS derived from all analyzed members of
the phylum Bacteroidetes (Bacteroides species and Prevotella
copri) also showed a severely impaired capacity to elicit the pro-
duction of these inflammatory cytokines. We then measured
cytokine production in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells
after stimulation with LPS from these same strains and obtained
similar results (Figures 5B and S7B). Consistent with assays in
primary cells, E. coli-derived LPS elicited high levels of luciferase
activity in TLR4-NF-kB reporter cells, whereas Bacteroides spe-
cies failed to induce an inflammatory signal in these cells (Figures
5C and S7C).
Our metagenomics analyses revealed that E. coli and B. dorei
LPS often co-occur in the gut of Finnish and Estonian infants. In
order to study possible interactions between these LPS sub-
types, we used a base dose of E. coli LPS, while co-treating hu-
man primary immune cells with B. dorei LPS at increasing ratios.
We then measured changes in the production of inflammatory
cytokines with respect to baseline E. coli LPS stimulation. Cyto-
kine production was inhibited by B. dorei LPS in primary human

(Figure

We
also
obtained similar results when examining
cord blood mononuclear cells (Figures
S7E and S7F), suggesting that our obser-
vations reflect the reaction of the naive
immune system of infants. Our results
show that B. dorei LPS acts as an inhibitor of immune stimulation
by E. coli-derived LPS, with a potency that is concordant with
ratios of the LPS subtypes observed in vivo.

 It has been proposed that lipid A phosphorylation pattern con-
tributes to LPS immunogenicity. However, LPS from a mutant
strain of B. thetaiotaomicron (DLpxF), whose lipid A structure is
identical to that of B. dorei but harbors two phosphate groups
similar to E. coli (Cullen et al., 2015), did not increase LPS immu-
nogenicity or alter its inhibitory capacity (Figures S7G and S7H).
This suggests that lipid A phosphorylation status is unlikely to be
the underlying mechanism of our observations.
Stimulation of immune cells with LPS induces a temporary
refractory state to a repeated immune challenge, a phenomenon
known as endotoxin tolerance (Watson and Kim, 1963). This
mechanism of immunosuppression was originally described in
sepsis, but is thought to underlie multiple other physiological
contexts of innate immune unresponsiveness, such as the im-
mune protective effect conferred by microbial exposure sug-
gested by the hygiene hypothesis (Biswas and Lopez-Collazo,
2009). We assessed the potency of E. coli and B. dorei LPS sub-
types to induce endotoxin tolerance in primary human mono-
cytes. Initial exposure to E. coli LPS prevented TNFa production
after restimulation at all conditioning doses tested (Figure 5F). In
contrast, B. dorei LPS conditioning did not abrogate cytokine
production in these cells even at the highest concentrations, cor-
responding to a potency at least four orders of magnitude lower
than E. coli LPS. Hence, the LPS produced by B. dorei failed to
induce protective endotoxin tolerance. Finally, the addition of
B. dorei LPS to E. coli LPS during the endotoxin tolerance induc-
tion phase prevented the establishment of endotoxin tolerance
by E. coli LPS in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5G), suggest-
ing that the presence of B. dorei in the infant gut could prevent
the establishment of protective immune tolerance by E. coli LPS.
To demonstrate the relevance of LPS-driven immune suppres-
sion in the development of autoimmunity in vivo, we assessed the
impact of different LPS subtypes on diabetes development in the
non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of T1D. Intraperitoneal
(i.p.) injection of E. coli LPS resulted in a delayed onset and
reduced overall incidence of disease, as measured by blood
glucose levels (Figure 5H). In contrast, B. dorei LPS did not delay
the onset of diabetes and did not decrease incidence compared
to the mock-injected group (PBS). Interestingly, as shown in Fig-
ure 5I, we also found that splenocytes isolated from NOD mice
24 hr after i.p. E. coli LPS injection were hyporesponsive to further
in vitro innate immune stimulation, whereas B. dorei LPS did not
alter the response. This shows that E. coli LPS, but not B. dorei
LPS, can induce endotoxin tolerance in vivo in NOD mice. These
results suggest that exposure to immunostimulatory LPS can
contribute to protection from immune-mediated diseases by
modulating the immune system responsiveness.
DISCUSSION
A growing body of evidence suggests that the gut microbiome
may be a key factor in influencing predisposition to autoimmunity
and allergic diseases. Here, we characterized infant gut micro-
biome development between three environmentally disparate
populations and identified marked differences between these
populations in the prevalence of important intestinal microbes,
such as Bifidobacterium and LPS-producing Bacteroides spe-
cies (Figure 6). Subsequently, we identified lipid A biosynthesis
as one of the most differentially abundant functional pathways
between the populations, suggesting that early microbial com-
munities in Finnish and Estonian subjects produce more LPS
compared to their Russian counterparts. Additionally, we uncov-
ered functional and structural differences in the dominant micro-
bial LPS subtypes. Notably, we showed that LPS produced by
different constituents of the human gut microbiome could either
stimulate or actively inhibit TLR4, NF-kB activation, and endo-
toxin tolerance. Hence, rather than the mere amount of LPS,
the nature and composition of different LPS subtypes seem
to determine the level of immune activation triggered by the
microbe-derived LPS cocktail. Importantly, we show that injec-
tion of an immunogenic subtype of LPS from E. coli can both
elicit endotoxin tolerance in vivo in NOD mice and decrease
the incidence of diabetes in these mice. These effects were not
observed with LPS from B. dorei. Our observations suggest
that microbiome-derived LPS could impact long-term immu-
nosuppressive mechanisms in more complex ways than has
been previously appreciated.
In the absence of specific biomarkers, we cannot determine
what impact the differences in early LPS exposure has had in

Figure 6. Differences in HMO-Utilizing Bacteria Provide a Route to
Differences in Immune Education
Human milk oligosaccharides can be metabolized by different prevalent
microbes in Russia (primarily Bifidobacterium species) versus Finland and
Estonia (primarily Bacteroides species). Potentially as a result of these popu-
lation differences, Bacteroides-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) constitutes
the major portion of LPS produced by microbes in Finnish and Estonian
infants, whereas LPS in Russian infants is mostly derived from E. coli. Bac-
teroides-derived LPS is of an immunoinhibitory subtype, thus leading to dif-
ferential immune education by means of endotoxin tolerance or other routes.

 Russian and Finnish infants in our cohort. However, the proposi-
tion of a direct impact of LPS on the pathophysiology of T1D
is further supported by previous studies in mice. For example,
Wen et al. (2008) have demonstrated that components of the mi-
crobiome modulate immune system activity, resulting in altered
disease development in NOD mice. In addition, LPS has a direct
impact on T1D progression in NOD mice by i.p. injection (Aumeu-
nier et al., 2010) and oral gavage (Saı
¨ and Rivereau, 1996). The
impact of the microbiome on T1D onset and development in
NOD mice is dependent on TLR4 and MyD88, critical compo-
nents of the LPS/TLR4 signal transduction pathway (Gu
¨ lden
et al., 2013; Wen et al., 2008). Taken together, these studies
support a model whereby exposure to different LPS subtypes
produced by the gut microbiome can contribute to immune
modulation and alter the course of autoimmunity.
One limitation of mouse studies is that LPS subtypes that are
antagonistic or silent in humans are instead recognized as stim-
ulatory in mice due to differences between the mouse and hu-
man LPS co-receptor MD2 (Hajjar et al., 2002). However, our
observation that mice react to E. coli LPS, but not to B. dorei
LPS, suggests that the non-immunogenicity of B. dorei LPS is
possibly independent of MD2 in both species. The specific
mechanism of the antagonism mediated by B. dorei LPS in
humans remains to be explored.
This study achieved a deep-level understanding of microbial
community establishment in three different infant populations.
Our analyses revealed a lengthy list of associations between mi-
crobial taxa and the rich metadata collected in the DIABIMMUNE
study, such as dietary information, mode of delivery, and the
use of antibiotics (see Table 1). A comprehensive list of our find-
ings, including microbial alterations relative to allergen-specific
IgE and T1D autoantibody seropositivity, containing numerous
potentially interesting features of microbiota, can be found at
http://pubs.broadinstitute.org/diabimmune.
Our analysis more broadly exercises a generalizable discovery
and validation process for identifying and characterizing bioac-
tive microbial products from the microbiome (Figure 1C). We
began by identifying differentially abundant microbial processes
between phenotypically distinct populations, assigned them to
specific microbes, and, ultimately, identified structural differ-
ences within these pathways (e.g., LPS) that induced distinct im-
mune responses in vitro. We targeted LPS biosynthesis for initial
mechanistic follow-up because it was among the strongest
signals and has a well-established connection to immune activa-
tion. This can be expanded in the future, since our study pop-
ulation included many additional functional differences in the
gut, ranging from microbial metabolism (e.g., glycolysis) to iron
uptake.
We found that HMO metabolism was a potential factor
in establishing and/or maintaining a Bifidobacterium-dominant
versus Bacteroides-dominant gut microbiota in the first year of
life, likely because the two genera compete for HMOs as a com-
mon energy source (Marcobal et al., 2011). A significant role for
HMO metabolism in determining microbial community composi-
tion is consistent with the hygiene hypothesis, given that mothers
are also under environmental stress and can transfer these
effects to their infants. In vaginal births, most of the early infant
gut colonizers are derived from the mother’s gut (Ba
¨ ckhed
et al., 2015) and possibly consolidated by the microbiome in
breast milk (Hunt et al., 2011). Transcriptomic analysis of cord
blood from the infants in this cohort revealed a signal resembling
the response to LPS exposure, suggesting that these infants are
exposed to environmental stresses even before birth (Kallionpa
¨ a
¨
et al., 2014).
The effects of the hygiene hypothesis are most likely mediated
through not just one mechanism but rather a complex interplay of
environmental factors. These likely include immune responses
to multiple different parasites, helminths, microbes, and viruses.
Here, we have identified one potential contributing factor,
namely, immunogenicity of early colonizing symbiotic bacteria.
Understanding how the different members of our microbiota
contribute to the development of our immune system alone and
in combination will be a key step in the development of probiotic
interventions that may alter the increasing trends of autoimmune
diseases in countries such as Finland.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Study Cohort
The international DIABIMMUNE study recruited 832 families in Finland
(Espoo), Estonia (Tartu), and Russia (Petrozavodsk) with infants carrying
HLA alleles that conferred risk for autoimmunity (Larizza et al., 2012; Sollid
and Thorsby, 1993). The newborns were followed by monthly stool sampling,
periodic laboratory assays, and questionnaires regarding breastfeeding, diet,
allergies, infections, family history, use of drugs, and clinical examinations. For
this study, data from 74 infants per country were selected to be analyzed
based on similar HLA risk class distribution and matching gender between
the countries. The DIABIMMUNE study was conducted according to the
guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures involving
human subjects were approved by the local ethical committees of the partici-
pating hospitals. The parents and/or study subjects gave their written informed
voluntary consent prior to sample collection.
Stool Sample Collection and DNA Extraction
Stool samples were collected by the participants’ parents and stored in the
household freezer (�20�C) until the next visit to the local study center; samples
were then shipped on dry ice to the DIABIMMUNE Core Laboratory in Helsinki.
The samples were then stored at �80�C until shipping to the Broad Institute for
DNA extraction. DNA extractions from stool were carried out using the QIAamp
DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN).
Library Construction, Sequencing, and Analysis of the 16S rRNA
Gene and Shotgun Metagenomics
16S rRNA gene libraries were constructed as previously described by Kostic
et al. (2015). Metagenomic libraries were prepared using Nextera XT DNA
Library Preparation Kit (Illumina). 16S and metagenomic libraries were
sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. 16S data were processed us-
ing QIIME, and taxonomy was assigned according to Greengenes taxonomy
map. Metagenomic data were analyzed using MetaPhlAn (v.2.2) (Truong
et al., 2015) for taxonomic profiling and HUMAnN2 (http://huttenhower.sph.
harvard.edu/humann2) for functional profiling. Associations with metadata
were analyzed using MaAsLin, a linear modeling system adapted for microbial
community data (http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/maaslin). Metagenomic
samples were additionally analyzed using ConStrains (Luo et al., 2015), which
conducts within-species strain haplotyping by deconvoluting SNP patterns
detected from mapping reads to species core genes across samples. See
the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for detailed methodology.
Bacterial Strains and LPS Purification
The bacterial strains used in the study are summarized in Table S3. LPS
purification was performed by hot phenol-water method (Hirschfeld et al.,
2000).

 Human Immune Stimulation Assays
Primary human PBMCs, in-vitro-differentiated monocyte-derived dendritic
cells, or HEK293-NF-kB reporter cells expressing hTLR4 were stimulated
with the indicated doses of LPS purified from various strains (Table S3). In
primary cells, cytokine concentrations in the supernatant after 24 hr were
measured by cytokine bead array analysis (BD Biosciences). In HEK293 cells,
stimulation was measured by Luciferase (BrightGlo, Promega).
Endotoxin Tolerance Assays
Primary monocytes were isolated from human PBMCs and incubated in the
presence of LPS purified from B. dorei or E. coli at the indicated doses for
18–20 hr. Cells were then washed and cultured in cRPMI for 3 days. Mono-
cytes were challenged with a standard dose of 5 mg/ml of zymosan. Superna-
tants were collected after 20 hr and analyzed using the cytokine bead array
human inflammation kit (BD Biosciences) in accordance with the manufac-
turer’s instructions.
Diabetes Incidence in NOD Mice
All animal studies were conducted under protocols approved by the Institu-
tional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at NIBR. NOD/ShiLTj mice
were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. Groups of 9 to 12 8-week-old
mice were injected intraperitoneally with 10 mg LPS purified from either
E. coli or B. dorei once a week for 4 consecutive weeks. Non-fasting blood
glucose was monitored weekly. The experimenter was blinded to the nature
of the treatment for each group. Animals with either one reading above
300 mg/dl or two consecutive readings above 250 mg/dl were deemed
diabetic.
Endotoxin Tolerance in NOD Mice
Groups of five mice were injected i.p. with 10 mg LPS purified from either E. coli
or B. dorei. After 24 hr, the splenocytes were isolated and restimulated in vitro
with zymosan (2.5 mg/ml). TNFa concentration was assessed by cytokine bead
array after 24 hr.
