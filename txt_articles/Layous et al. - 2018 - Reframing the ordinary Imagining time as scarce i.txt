ABSTRACT
We explored a counterintuitive approach to increasing happiness: Imagining time as scarce. 
Participants were randomly assigned to try to live this month (LTM) like it was their last in their 
current city (time scarcity intervention; n = 69) or to keep track of their daily activities (neutral 
control; n = 70). Each group reported their activities and their psychological need satisfaction 
(connectedness, competence, and autonomy) weekly for 4 weeks. At baseline, post-intervention, 
and 2-week follow-up, participants reported their well-being – a composite of life satisfaction, 
positive emotions, and negative emotions. Participants in the LTM condition increased in well-being 
over time compared to the control group. Furthermore, mediation analyses indicated that these 
differences in well-being were explained by greater connectedness, competence, and autonomy. 
Thus, imagining time as scarce prompted people to seize the moment and extract greater well-
being from their lives.
The curious thing was that with the loss of Paris threat-
ening, we became more Parisian. The same thing, I had 
noted, had happened in our last few months in New York. 
The city, which had become increasingly difficult, sud-
denly seemed like a playground – people eating outside, 
in T-shirts and shorts and sneakers in the Italian restau-
rants in SoHo; the open-all-nightness of New York; the 
sweet funkiness – registered as it hadn’t in years.
Adam Gopnik, Paris to the Moon
‘Gather ye rosebuds while ye may’ advises seventeenth 
century poet Robert Herrick – emphasizing both the ines-
capable brevity of life and the need to enjoy it while it lasts. 
Indeed, research supports the age-old wisdom that peo-
ple who savor the moment derive greater enjoyment and 
happiness from life (Jose, Lim, & Bryant, 2012; Quoidbach, 
Berry, Hansenne, & Mikolajczak, 2010). Given substantial 
evidence demonstrating the benefits of happiness on 
relationships, health, and work, encouraging people to 
appreciate daily events is worthwhile advice.
However, both anecdotal and empirical evidence sug-
gest that savoring everyday life is often challenging. Even 
the most beautiful or noteworthy events are susceptible 
to the process of hedonic adaptation, whereby they lose 
their emotional impact over time and through repeated 
exposure (Lyubomirsky, 2011). In addition, the demands of 
daily life urge people to multitask or leave them distracted 
(Killingsworth & Gilbert, 2010), making savoring difficult. 
Building on previous theoretical and empirical work, the 
current study tests a little-studied strategy for savoring 
the moment that Herrick’s verses vividly emphasize – a 
deliberate focus on the scarcity of time.
Savoring and savoring interventions
Savoring is a type of emotion regulation in which peo-
ple recognize and amplify the impact of positive events 
on positive emotions by responding in cognitively and 
behaviorally receptive ways (e.g. by being present and 
non-distracted during a positive moment with one’s 
family or choosing to linger in an awe-inspiring location; 
Bryant & Veroff, 2007; Quoidbach, Mikolajczak, & Gross, 
2015). ‘Savoring interventions’ are designed to encourage 
people’s awareness of and receptivity to positive events. 
Past evidence-based approaches to enhancing savoring 
have included a direct and intentional focus on increas-
ing savoring (i.e. through journaling about savoring 
efforts [Hurley & Kwon, 2012] or counting one’s blessings 
[Emmons & McCullough, 2003]) or indirect strategies such 
as limiting exposure to something pleasurable (i.e. choco-
late) to enhance its enjoyment (Quoidbach & Dunn, 2013), 
and, similarly, imagining what life would be like without 
a significant other (Koo, Algoe, Wilson, & Gilbert, 2008; 
Lyubomirsky, Sousa, & Dickerhoof, 2006; Suddendorf 
& Corballis, 2007). Researchers have also designed suc-
cessful techniques to help people appreciate their pasts

colleagues, they may feel like they are just where they want 
to be – making their own choices (e.g. spending their last 
week-end relishing the outdoors), effectively managing 
their lives (e.g. finally finishing that work project), and 
engaging in meaningful relationships (e.g. making plans 
for more outings with friends), thus satisfying their needs 
for autonomy, competence, and connectedness, respec-
tively. Alternatively, when people distractedly move 
through their days – or worse, repetitively focus on their 
days’ negative aspects – they may feel forced or trapped in 
their current situation, ineffective in managing daily tasks, 
and unfulfilled by their relationships (e.g. Killingsworth & 
Gilbert, 2010). Although research has shown that savoring 
enhances well-being, no studies to our knowledge have 
tested whether psychological need satisfaction may be 
driving these effects.
The present research
In a 4-week-long experiment, we tested whether students 
prompted to imagine that they were moving in one month 
– thereby activating a sense of temporal scarcity – would 
show greater global well-being over time than students 
asked to list their weekly activities. Additionally, we tested 
a mechanism by which this savoring strategy might boost 
well-being (i.e. via need satisfaction), as well as the dura-
tion of the effect with a 2-week follow-up.
Method
Participants
Participants 
were 
139 
undergraduate 
students 
(Mage = 18.73, SD = 2.24) at a large mid-Atlantic university 
who were given course credit in exchange for their partic-
ipation. They were mostly female (86.3%), White (84.2%), 
and first-year students (65.7%). Twenty-two participants 
failed to complete the post-intervention time point 
(remaining N = 117), but the attrition was evenly spread 
across gender, χ2(1) = 0.45, p = 0.50, ethnic background, 
χ2(5) = 3.41, p = 0.64, and condition, χ2(1) = 2.05, p = 0.15. 
Twenty-eight participants failed to complete the follow-up 
time point (remaining N = 111) and again, the attrition was 
evenly spread across gender, χ2(1) = 0.01, p = 0.92, ethnic 
background, χ2(5) = 3.86, p = 0.57, and condition, χ2(1) = 
0.22, p = 0.64. Based on previous research, we expected a 
medium effect size to represent the difference in well-be-
ing between the intervention and control groups (Cohen’s 
d = 0.61; Sin & Lyubomirsky, 2009) and sought to have 
70 participants per group to achieve over 90% power. We 
planned to recruit as many participants as possible in one 
quarter of subject pool participation and then to recruit in 
a subsequent quarter if we had not reached 70 participants 
(e.g. positive reminiscence; Bryant, Smart, & King, 2005 or 
positively anticipate their futures (Quoidbach, Wood, & 
Hansenne, 2009; Suddendorf & Corballis, 2007). The cur-
rent investigation focuses on a previously untested strat-
egy for fostering savoring in the present.
Activating a sense of temporal scarcity
As the epigraph suggests, having a limited amount of time 
left in Paris and New York increased the author’s appreci-
ation of his surroundings. Indeed, according to the scar-
city principle, when a resource is limited, the value of it 
increases (Cialdini, 2001). Conversely, resources that are 
in ample supply have little value because they are readily 
obtainable (Quoidbach, Dunn, Hansenne, & Bustin, 2015). 
Thus, if people view time in a certain place or with a certain 
person as limited (i.e. if they are traveling or moving soon), 
they may relish each moment to a greater degree (see also 
Carstensen, Isaacowitz, & Charles, 1999). An experiment 
that randomly assigned students in their last semester of 
college to receive a description of graduation as occurring 
very soon (i.e. ‘only 1200 h remain’) versus far away (i.e. 
‘still have 1/10th of a year left’) found that those in the 
‘graduating soon’ condition engaged in relatively more 
college-oriented behaviors in their remaining time and 
reported relatively higher levels of happiness (Kurtz, 2008). 
We seek to extend this work to explore a more general 
and more broadly applicable strategy – that is, whether 
simply asking people to assume that time is scarce in a 
given location will show the same effects as framing time 
as limited when an actual life phase, like college, is end-
ing. Specifically, we asked participants to imagine having 
only 30 days left before moving away and to intentionally 
engage in activities and spend time with people they will 
miss after they are gone.
Proposed mechanism: Need satisfaction
We predict that inducing time scarcity will enhance 
well-being in part because it will increase an individual’s 
receptivity to the positive aspects of his or her surround-
ings, including locations, events, and people. Additionally, 
we explore a previously untested hypothesis – namely, that 
the individual’s increased receptivity will in turn facilitate 
psychological need satisfaction, which will drive changes 
in well-being. Self-determination theory proposes that 
people have three fundamental psychological needs that 
promote optimal motivation, development, and well- 
being (Ryan & Deci, 2000): Autonomy (feeling in control 
of one’s own actions), competence (feeling skilled and 
effective), and connectedness (feeling close and con-
nected to others). When people take action to savor their 
surroundings, including their nearby friends, family, and

per cell. We were able to complete recruitment in our first 
quarter of data collection.1
Design and procedure
The study, conducted entirely online, consisted of a 4-week 
intervention period and a follow-up assessment 2 weeks 
later, with a total duration of 6 weeks. The 2-week follow-up 
period was chosen out of convenience – we needed to 
include enough time to recruit a sufficient number of par-
ticipants and have them complete the study within the 
semester. Upon logging in to the study website for the 
first time, students were randomly assigned to one of two 
possible conditions: living this month like it was their last 
in their college town for a while (‘live this month’ [LTM]; 
n = 70) or keeping track of what they do over the course 
of the week (the neutral comparison condition; n = 69).2 
Our study website used simple random assignment, such 
that each participant had equal chance of being assigned 
to each condition, regardless of the assignment of previ-
ous participants. To minimize potential demand effects, all 
participants were told that they would engage in positive 
practices designed to increase well-being.
Participants in the LTM condition were administered 
the following instructions:
Think about where you live right now. Consider all of the 
reasons that you like this area – special people, specific 
restaurants, places that are remarkably beautiful. Now, 
imagine that you will be moving far away in 30 days 
[countdown days depending on how far participants are 
in the study – e.g. 23 days a week after the first day]. Plan 
the next 30 days [countdown] like they will be your last 
chance for a long while to enjoy your surroundings (e.g. 
people, places, other comforts). During this month, do all 
of the things you are going to miss while you’re away. For 
example, get in touch with friends who are special to you 
and spend time in the spots that have made your current 
location feel like home to you. Seize the moment and 
take the time to enjoy what you love most about where 
you live, work, and study.
Next, participants were told that they do not need to 
spend a lot of money or extra time to live their lives in 
this way and that, as much as they can, they should try to 
actively appreciate and savor the activities they do while 
they do them. Lastly, they were asked to keep track of what 
they did and the thoughts and emotions they experienced, 
as they would be reporting back weekly on their activities 
and experiences. When participants logged back into the 
website the following week, they wrote for 8 min about 
what they did, with whom they spent time (if anyone), 
and what thoughts and emotions they experienced. The 
following is an example from one participant in the LTM 
condition:
During this week I enjoyed the beautiful campus I live on 
by doing many different things. I walked around campus 
to classes instead of taking the bus. I sat on the quad and 
enjoyed the scenery. I also visited skyline drive off cam-
pus with my boyfriend to stargaze. We went to dinner 
off campus in downtown Harrisonburg. I went shopping 
and spent time with my roommate watching movies and 
eating Taco Bell. I spent time with my friend Casey stud-
ying the bible like we do every week and tried to get the 
most out of it as much as I could. I enjoyed surprising my 
boyfriend for his birthday with all of his friends waiting to 
sing happy birthday and. Focusing on others gives me a 
sense of purpose. I worked on homework and studied a 
lot. I did well on my health exam after studying very hard 
which was a great accomplishment. I was productive but 
didn’t spend too much time doing work without spend-
ing time with friends.
Participants in the control group were given the follow-
ing instructions:
During the next 7 days, keep track of your daily activi-
ties. You do not need to remember who you were with 
or how you might have felt during that time. Instead, just 
remember factual information about what you did. Do 
not alter your routine in any way; simply keep track of 
what you do. When you log back in to the study, you will 
be asked to write an outline of what you did. For exam-
ple: Monday: Went to school, gave a presentation in class, 
went to the gym, ate dinner, did homework, watched tv, 
went to bed. Tuesday: Went to work, had a meeting for 
new student organization, did homework, etc. Only the 
facts are important.
Upon logging back into the study website the follow-
ing week, they wrote for 8 min about the activities they 
had done without considering their emotions or opinions 
pertaining to their plans. The following is an example from 
one participant in the control group:
Monday I went to lunch with a sorority sister, worked out, 
hungout with my hallmates and attended classes.
Tuesday I went to lunch with another sorority sister, 
met my group at carrier library for my psych project and 
worked with them for a few house. I went to my 5 o clock 
math class. Then went to Urec with my friend Rachel. 
When we got back to the dorm, we did hw together.
On Wednesday, I met with some girls for lunch, attended 
classes, napped inbetween and went to a sorority meet-
ing afterwards. Late at night I watched tv on my computer.
Thursday two of my classes were canceled so I slept ALOT. 
Literally I stayed in bed and watched Modern Family until 
4:30 when I got ready for 5 pm math class. I went to car-
rier to meet for my project afterwards and then met with 
my sorority group to study for our national test. At night, 
my friend and I watched tv and did our nails.
On Friday, I went to my GCOM class and got my grade 
back for my speech (A) and I was so excited! I spent 
the day with my roommate getting coffee and walking 
around campus. We hungout in TDU until 4 pm. We then 
went shopping at wall mart and had a rough time with 
the bus schedule. We bought halloween stuff and arts 
and craft materials. When we finally returned from that

either of two original coders, but it was not. We did not 
directly ask participants to state whether they engaged in 
a familiar or new activity or whether they interacted with 
nature; thus, there was sufficient ambiguity to undermine 
reliable ratings of those particular activities.
Results
Analyses of baseline well-being (WB) revealed no significant 
differences by condition, t(137) = −0.42, p = 0.68 (LTM dum-
my-coded as ‘1’), sex, t(137) = 1.34, p = 0.18, ethnicity, F(5, 
133) = 1.12, p = 0.35, or between participants who did ver-
sus did not complete the post-intervention, t(137) = 0.28, 
p = 0.78, and follow-up time points, t(137) = −1.15, p = 0.25.
During the first week of the activity, coders indicated 
that 15.2% of participants in the LTM condition spent time 
with a romantic partner, 87.9% spent time with friends, 
34.8% spent time with family, 22.7% spent time alone, and 
33.3% shared a meal with another person.
To assess within-person changes in WB over time 
and condition differences in WB trajectories, we esti-
mated multilevel growth models (Pinheiro & Bates, 2014; 
Singer & Willett, 2003). Participants in the LTM condition 
showed steeper gains in linear WB than the control group, 
γ11 = 0.11, SE = 0.06, t(228) = 2.00, p = 0.05, 95% CI [0.002, 
0.22], d = 0.25, which also showed linear gains in well-be-
ing over time, γ10 = 0.09, SE = 0.04, t(228) = 2.13, p = 0.03, 
95% CI [0.007, 0.16], d = 0.21. Thus, by the end of the inter-
vention, participants in the LTM condition increased in 
well-being by nearly a half a standard deviation (d = 0.46), 
whereas those in the control group increased in well-being 
by less than half as much (d = 0.21).3
Using Preacher and Hayes (2008) recommended proce-
dures, we estimated bootstrap bias-corrected confidence 
intervals (with 5000 bootstrapped samples) for the spe-
cific indirect effect of condition (LTM = 1; Control = 0) on 
post-intervention and follow-up well-being via average 
level of need satisfaction throughout the intervention 
(see Figures 1 and 2 for OLS regression coefficients). The 
bootstrap analyses supported our prediction of a positive 
indirect effect of the LTM condition on well-being via need 
satisfaction for both the post-intervention, 95% CI [0.03, 
0.27], and follow-up, [0.002, 0.19], time points, suggesting 
that the LTM condition prompted greater need satisfaction 
than the control group, which precipitated higher well- 
being at post-intervention and follow-up.
adventure, we watched a movie in my friends room and 
made calendars that we found on Pinterest. Afterwards, 
we did some cleaning and went to sleep.
Saturday was the start of family weekend. I woke up and 
went for a jog through campus because my family wasn’t 
coming. Then, I showered and got ready for the game. My 
friends family was here and they brought us tailgate food 
that we had in our dorm rooms. Then my roommate and 
I attended the game together. We sat with just ourselves 
but still had a blast! The dukes won. After the game, I 
went home and tried to do hw but ended up watching tv 
and then getting dinner with a hallmate.
After reporting on their activities, all participants com-
pleted the Brief Measure of Psychological Needs (Sheldon 
& Hilpert, 2012) and received instructions to engage in the 
activity again during the following week (except during 
the last time point). The need satisfaction items were aver-
aged across the middle time points and the composite was 
used to assess mediation (Cronbach’s αs > 0.79 across time 
points). At baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up, par-
ticipants completed measures of the outcome variables – 
namely, we assessed life satisfaction with the Satisfaction 
with Life Scale (αs ≥ 0.86 for each time point; Diener, 
Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1985), and positive and negative 
emotions with the Modified Differential Emotions Scale 
(αs > 0.83 for each subscale at each time point; Fredrickson, 
Tugade, Waugh, & Larkin, 2003). We standardized life sat-
isfaction, positive emotions, and reverse-scored negative 
emotions separately and combined into a well-being 
composite for analyses (Diener, Suh, Lucas, & Smith, 1999). 
See Table 1 for well-being means by condition at baseline, 
post-intervention, and follow-up time points.
Lastly, two independent coders rated participants’ writ-
ten responses in the LTM condition after the first week to 
explore what participants actually did in this condition. 
We found adequate agreement on whether participants 
spent time with a romantic partner (Cohen’s ĸ = 0.69) or 
family (ĸ = 0.72), but less agreement on whether they spent 
time with friends (ĸ = 0.52) or time alone (ĸ = 0.56; Garson, 
2013). We also found adequate agreement on whether par-
ticipants shared a meal with another person (ĸ = 0.64), but 
much less agreement on whether participants interacted 
with nature (ĸ = 0.39), spent time reflecting (ĸ = 0.25), did 
something new (ĸ = 0.38), or did something familiar to 
them (ĸ = −0.04). To improve agreement, we included rat-
ings from a new independent coder and checked whether 
agreement was better between the third (new) coder and

simulate the experience of scarcity. Additionally, we found 
one mechanism by which savoring enhances well-being – 
by leading individuals to feel more connected, competent, 
and in control.
Whereas activities like intentionally thinking gratefully 
or optimistically are intuitively positive, thinking about 
time scarcity is a counterintuitive way of increasing hap-
piness because it involves the contemplation of an upcom-
ing loss (see also Koo et al., 2008). Indeed, people tend to 
underestimate the degree to which thinking about time 
scarcity will make them feel happy and overestimate 
the degree to which it will make them feel sad, perhaps 
Discussion
College students who were prompted to savor the next 
30 days showed steeper gains in well-being over time than 
students in the control group, thus supporting our pre-
diction that framing time as limited helps people derive 
greater happiness from their surroundings. While previous 
research found that this strategy was effective for students 
several weeks prior to their college graduation, when the 
move was imminent (Kurtz, 2008), the current findings sug-
gest that this strategy has broader utility. Our sample was 
primarily college freshmen, who still have an abundance 
of time left in college, and yet they could still mentally

effects of planning, doing, and enjoying. Future studies 
could include a third condition in which participants are 
instructed to plan activities they enjoy throughout the 
intervention, but without the time scarcity framing (i.e. a 
positive comparison group). If our underlying theory is cor-
rect, we expect that simply planning and doing activities 
will be less effective than our time scarcity manipulation 
because it will lack the mindset toward savoring that we 
think is a key component of the current manipulation.
Importantly, although our use of a college student 
sample likely limits the generalizability of our findings, it 
points to an intriguing future direction. Past research has 
shown that younger people garner more happiness from 
extraordinary experiences in their lives, whereas older 
people garner more happiness from ordinary experiences 
(Bhattacharjee & Mogilner, 2014). Thus, college students 
may need encouragement – like the type provided by 
our time scarcity intervention – to derive need satisfac-
tion and happiness from their daily experiences. However, 
this intervention may either not boost well-being in older 
adults, because they are already in the habit of savoring 
their daily experiences, or it may even reduce well-be-
ing, as they try to alter something they already do well 
(see Carstensen et al., 1999) or worry about leaving close 
friends and family whom they value. Future research could 
explore the age boundary condition on the effect of this 
intervention. In addition, our sample was largely female 
and we did not have enough power to explore moderation 
by gender. Lastly, our findings are preliminary and under-
powered to detect the small effect size observed between 
the intervention and control group. Future research would 
do well to replicate this finding and include more male 
participants to ensure generalization to men.
In sum, our experiment provides preliminary evidence 
that intentionally viewing time as scarce can make peo-
ple happier, perhaps by encouraging them to enjoy and 
derive autonomy, competence, and connectedness from 
their quotidian experiences and surroundings. Our success 
with manufacturing scarcity in a group of first-year college 
students (where no such actual scarcity exists) means that 
in line with Hendricks’ poetic entreaties, one may benefit 
from ‘gathering rosebuds’ regardless of the season.
Notes
1.  
Because our between-condition effects on well-being 
ended up being relatively small, we only had 52% power 
to detect the reported between-condition slope effect.
2.  
A third condition, unrelated to the LTM condition, was 
run simultaneously for comparison with the control 
group and is reported in a separate paper. In this 
condition, participants were asked to ‘make someone 
else happier’ each week for 4 weeks. Although we 
predicted both conditions would increase well-being, 
we believed them to work via different mechanisms – the 
because they fixate on the impending loss (Kurtz, 2006; 
Wilson & Gilbert, 2005). The practice of manufacturing 
scarcity is a ‘stealth’ counterintuitive happiness strategy 
that works in spite of individuals’ assumptions (who tend 
to believe it will be bad for them), and thus, succeeds in 
spite of the placebo effect that plagues other straightfor-
wardly positive interventions such as practicing gratitude 
or optimism.
Although the current study demonstrated increases 
in well-being after thinking about time as limited, other 
studies have suggested that thinking about endings (e.g. 
visiting a place of personal significance for the last time) 
elicits mixed emotions – higher positive affect, but also 
higher negative affect (Ersner-Hershfield, Mikels, Sullivan, 
& Carstensen, 2008). Additionally, certain types of time 
scarcity (e.g. too little time to accomplish a specific goal) 
can have detrimental consequences like increased stress 
and cognitive depletion (Mani, Mullainathan, Shafir, & 
Zhao, 2013; Shah, Mullainathan, & Shafir, 2012). In contrast, 
we did not observe increases in negative affect over the 
course of our study. Possibly, because time was not actu-
ally limited for our participants, they were able to extract 
positivity from their environments without the poignancy 
or stress that accompanies real endings. Furthermore, our 
study called for more than just using one’s imagination; 
hence, participants’ actual positive experiences during the 
course of the month-long study period may have offset 
any bittersweet feelings brought about by imagining a far-
away move. Future studies could tease apart the emotional 
effects of different types of time scarcity inductions (e.g. 
involving imagination in the laboratory versus savoring in 
day-to-day naturalistic settings) and their proximity to real 
endings (e.g. knowing that college will not last forever may 
help one savor the moment as a freshman and sophomore, 
but might induce feelings of sadness as graduation draws 
nearer). In addition, future studies could employ experi-
ence sampling or day reconstruction methodology to track 
the moment-to-moment thoughts and emotions of peo-
ple in the ‘LTM’ condition. For example, we currently do not 
know whether or how often they were actually thinking 
about time scarcity. Another possibility is that they expe-
rienced waves of negative emotions (such as sadness or 
anxiety) or at least nostalgic, bittersweet feelings that were 
not perceptible in our weekly reports.
In addition, in the current study, we cannot be sure 
whether our time scarcity manipulation boosted need 
satisfaction and global well-being because it prompted 
people to engage in more pleasant activities or because 
it prompted the active appreciation and enjoyment of 
those activities. Specifically, our experimental design 
leads us to conclude that our time scarcity instructions 
led participants to become more motivated to plan, 
do, and enjoy activities, but we did not disentangle the

Cohen’s ds for the slope predictors were calculated with 
the following formula: d = b(time)/SDraw where b is the 
unstandardized regression coefficient of interest, time is 
the number of time points after baseline (2; time was 
coded as 0, 1, 2), and SDraw is the standard deviation 
of well-being across groups at baseline (SDraw = 0.87;
