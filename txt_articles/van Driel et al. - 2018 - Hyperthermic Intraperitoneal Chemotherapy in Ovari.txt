BACKGROUND
Treatment of newly diagnosed advanced-stage ovarian cancer typically involves 
cytoreductive surgery and systemic chemotherapy. We conducted a trial to investigate 
whether the addition of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) to in-
terval cytoreductive surgery would improve outcomes among patients who were re-
ceiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for stage III epithelial ovarian cancer.
METHODS
In a multicenter, open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 245 patients who 
had at least stable disease after three cycles of carboplatin (area under the curve of 
5 to 6 mg per milliliter per minute) and paclitaxel (175 mg per square meter of 
body-surface area) to undergo interval cytoreductive surgery either with or without 
administration of HIPEC with cisplatin (100 mg per square meter). Randomization 
was performed at the time of surgery in cases in which surgery that would result 
in no visible disease (complete cytoreduction) or surgery after which one or more 
residual tumors measuring 10 mm or less in diameter remain (optimal cytoreduc-
tion) was deemed to be feasible. Three additional cycles of carboplatin and pacli-
taxel were administered postoperatively. The primary end point was recurrence-free 
survival. Overall survival and the side-effect profile were key secondary end points.
RESULTS
In the intention-to-treat analysis, events of disease recurrence or death occurred in 110 
of the 123 patients (89%) who underwent cytoreductive surgery without HIPEC (sur-
gery group) and in 99 of the 122 patients (81%) who underwent cytoreductive surgery 
with HIPEC (surgery-plus-HIPEC group) (hazard ratio for disease recurrence or death, 
0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50 to 0.87; P 
= 
0.003). The median recurrence-
free survival was 10.7 months in the surgery group and 14.2 months in the surgery-
plus-HIPEC group. At a median follow-up of 4.7 years, 76 patients (62%) in the surgery 
group and 61 patients (50%) in the surgery-plus-HIPEC group had died (hazard ratio, 
0.67; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.94; P 
= 
0.02). The median overall survival was 33.9 months 
in the surgery group and 45.7 months in the surgery-plus-HIPEC group. The percent-
age of patients who had adverse events of grade 3 or 4 was similar in the two groups 
(25% in the surgery group and 27% in the surgery-plus-HIPEC group, P 
= 
0.76).
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients with stage III epithelial ovarian cancer, the addition of HIPEC to 
interval cytoreductive surgery resulted in longer recurrence-free survival and overall 
survival than surgery alone and did not result in higher rates of side effects. (Funded

Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy
O
varian cancer is associated with 
the highest mortality of all gynecologic 
cancers in the western world. The major-
ity of patients receive a diagnosis of advanced dis-
ease that has spread beyond the ovaries to the 
peritoneal surface. The most effective treatment 
for advanced disease involves a maximum effort 
to reduce the tumor burden through surgery fol-
lowed by six cycles of intravenous chemotherapy 
with carboplatin and paclitaxel. Alternatively, in-
terval cytoreductive surgery is performed after 
three cycles of chemotherapy.1-4 Intraperitoneal 
delivery of chemotherapy enhances drug delivery at 
the peritoneal surface and may improve outcomes 
by eliminating residual microscopic peritoneal 
disease more efficiently than intravenous adminis-
tration of chemotherapy.
Combination treatment with intravenous and 
intraperitoneal chemotherapy has been shown to 
prolong overall survival after primary cytoreduc-
tive surgery among patients with stage III ovarian 
cancer.5-7 Catheter-related problems, increased de-
mands on the patient, and gastrointestinal and 
renal side effects have hampered the adoption of 
this approach in most countries. Delivery of the 
intraperitoneal chemotherapy at the end of surgery 
can circumvent most of these drawbacks while 
maintaining its advantages.
Intraperitoneal chemotherapy during surgery 
that can be delivered under hyperthermic condi-
tions is termed hyperthermic intraperitoneal che-
motherapy (HIPEC). Hyperthermia increases the 
penetration of chemotherapy at the peritoneal 
surface and increases the sensitivity of the cancer 
to chemotherapy by impairing DNA repair. Hy-
perthermia also induces apoptosis and activates 
heat-shock proteins that serve as receptors for 
natural killer cells, inhibits angiogenesis, and has 
a direct cytotoxic effect by promoting the denatur-
ation of proteins.8-11 The addition of HIPEC to 
interval cytoreductive surgery for the treatment 
of ovarian cancer is feasible, but efficacy data 
from randomized trials are lacking.12,13
We report the results of a randomized, open-
label, phase 3 trial of interval cytoreductive 
surgery with or without HIPEC in patients with 
International Federation of Gynecology and Ob-
stetrics stage III ovarian, fallopian tube, or peri-
toneal cancer who had at least stable disease after 
three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with 
carboplatin and paclitaxel.
Methods
Trial Oversight
The trial was designed by an executive committee 
that included lead investigators and a statistician. 
Approval for the trial protocol, which is available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org, was 
obtained from the relevant institutional review 
boards. Data were collected by the Netherlands 
Comprehensive Cancer Organisation. Final data 
collection and analysis were performed by person-
nel at the data coordinating center at the Depart-
ment of Biometrics, the Netherlands Cancer Insti-
tute, Amsterdam. The first author wrote the initial 
draft of the manuscript. All the authors contribut-
ed to subsequent revisions of the draft, agreed to 
submit the manuscript for publication, and vouch 
for the accuracy and completeness of the data and 
analyses and for the fidelity of the trial to the pro-
tocol. There were no agreements regarding con-
fidentiality between the sponsor and either the 
authors or the participating institutions.
Patients
Eligible patients had newly diagnosed stage III 
epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal 
cancer and were referred for neoadjuvant chemo-
therapy because their abdominal disease was too 
extensive for primary cytoreductive surgery or be-
cause surgery had been performed but was incom-
plete (i.e., after surgery, one or more residual tu-
mors measuring >1 cm in diameter were present). 
Eligibility criteria also included a World Health 
Organization performance-status score of 0 to 2 
(on a scale of 0 to 5, with higher numbers indi-
cating decreasing performance), normal blood 
counts, and adequate renal function. All the pa-
tients provided written informed consent before 
enrollment.
Trial Design
We performed a multicenter, randomized, open-
label, phase 3 trial to assess the efficacy and 
safety of interval cytoreductive surgery with HIPEC 
as compared with interval cytoreductive surgery 
without HIPEC. Patients who had received three 
cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with carbo-
platin (area under the curve of 5 to 6 mg per 
milliliter per minute) and paclitaxel (175 mg per 
square meter of body-surface area) could be reg-
istered in the trial before the interval cytoreductive

surgery took place. Randomization was performed 
at the time of surgery in cases in which complete 
or optimal cytoreduction was anticipated. Com-
plete cytoreductive surgery was defined as surgery 
that resulted in no visible disease (residual disease 
classification, R-1), optimal cytoreductive surgery 
as surgery that resulted in the presence of one or 
more residual tumors measuring less than 2.5 mm 
(R-2a) or 2.5 to 10 mm in diameter (R-2b), and 
incomplete cytoreductive surgery as surgery that 
resulted in the presence of one or more residual 
lesions measuring more than 10 mm in diameter. 
For logistic reasons, at two of the eight partici-
pating centers, a diagnostic laparoscopy was per-
formed before surgery to evaluate whether com-
plete or optimal surgery was feasible.
At the time of surgery, patients were randomly 
assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to undergo interval cyto-
reductive surgery either with HIPEC (surgery-plus-
HIPEC group) or without HIPEC (surgery group). 
Randomization was performed with the use of a 
minimization procedure, with stratification ac-
cording to previous surgery (yes vs. no), the hos-
pital in which the surgery was being performed, 
and the number of involved regions in the ab-
dominal cavity (0 to 5 vs. 6 to 8).
The trial was conducted at eight hospitals at 
which medical personnel had experience in admin-
istering HIPEC in patients with peritoneal disease 
from colon cancer or from pseudomyxoma peri-
tonei. HIPEC was administered at the end of the 
cytoreductive surgical procedure with the use of 
the open technique (detailed information regard-
ing the procedure can be found in the protocol). 
In brief, the abdomen was filled with saline that 
circulated continuously with the use of a roller 
pump through a heat exchanger. By circulation 
of the heated saline, an intraabdominal tempera-
ture of 40°C (104°F) was maintained. Perfusion 
with cisplatin at a dose of 100 mg per square 
meter and at a flow rate of 1 liter per minute was 
then initiated (with 50% of the dose perfused ini-
tially, 25% at 30 minutes, and 25% at 60 minutes). 
The perfusion volume was adjusted such that the 
entire abdomen was exposed to the perfusate. The 
HIPEC procedure took 120 minutes in total, in-
cluding the 90-minute perfusion period. At the 
end of the perfusion, drains were used to empty 
the abdominal cavity as completely as possible. To 
prevent nephrotoxicity, sodium thiosulphate was 
administered at the start of perfusion as an in-
travenous bolus (9 g per square meter in 200 ml), 
followed by a continuous infusion (12 g per square 
meter in 1000 ml) over 6 hours. Urine production 
was maintained at a minimum of 1 ml per kilo-
gram per hour during hyperthermic perfusion 
and for 3 hours after surgery.
Patients received an additional three cycles of 
carboplatin and paclitaxel after surgery. During 
follow-up, physical examinations and measure-
ment of the serum cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) 
level were repeated every 3 months for 2 years 
and then every 6 months until 5 years after the 
completion of chemotherapy. Computed tomog-
raphy was performed at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months 
after the last cycle of chemotherapy. Patients com-
pleted health-related quality-of-life questionnaires 
— the European Organisation for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life 
Questionnaire–Core 30 (QLQ-C30), Quality of 
Life Questionnaire–Ovarian Cancer Module 
(QLQ-OV28), and Quality of Life Questionnaire–
Colorectal Cancer Module (QLQ-CR38) — with-
in 2 weeks before randomization, before the fourth 
cycle of chemotherapy, 1 week after completion of 
chemotherapy, and during follow-up at 3, 6, 9, 
12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months.
End Points
The primary end point was recurrence-free surviv-
al, which was defined as the time from randomiza-
tion to disease recurrence or progression or death 
from any cause, whichever occurred first. Disease 
progression was defined according to Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), ver-
sion 1.1, or on the basis of an increase from 
baseline in the CA-125 level, whichever one of 
these two criteria was met first, as recommended 
by the Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup (GCIG)14 
(see the Supplementary Appendix, available at 
NEJM.org). Secondary end points included overall 
survival, the side-effect profile, and health-related 
quality of life; no correction for multiple testing 
was performed. Data on recurrence-free survival 
and overall survival were censored at the date of 
the last contact for the patients who remained 
alive and had no evidence of disease. The cutoff 
date for data was set at March 31, 2017.
Statistical Analysis
We determined that a sample of 245 patients with 
sufficient follow-up for observation of 192 events 
of disease recurrence, disease progression, or death 
would provide the trial with 80% power to detect

50% longer median recurrence-free survival (27 
months vs. 18 months, with a hazard ratio for 
disease recurrence, disease progression, or death 
of 0.67)5 in the surgery-plus-HIPEC group than in 
the surgery group, at an overall two-sided type I 
error rate of 0.05. A prespecified interim analysis 
for efficacy was performed after data from 50% 
of the required sample were available. The signifi-
cance level for the final analysis was set at 0.048 to 
preserve an overall significance level of 0.05.
Analyses of recurrence-free and overall sur-
vival were based on the intention-to-treat popu-
lation and were stratified according to previous 
surgery (yes vs. no), the hospital in which the sur-
gery was being performed, and the number of in-
volved areas in the abdominal cavity. Kaplan–Meier 
estimates were compared with the use of strati-
fied log-rank tests. Hazard ratios and the cor-
responding 95% confidence intervals were esti-
mated with the use of Cox proportional-hazards 
models. Exploratory analyses of recurrence-free 
survival and overall survival were prespecified for 
subgroups defined according to previous surgery 
(yes vs. no) and number of involved regions of the 
abdominal cavity and were performed post hoc 
for subgroups defined according to the patients’ 
age (<65 vs. ≥65 years), tumor histologic type 
(high-grade serous vs. other), and previous laparos-
copy (yes vs. no). Hazard ratios for the subgroup 
analyses are provided with 99% confidence in-
tervals. Adverse events were graded according to 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. In the 
safety analysis, we included data from all pa-
tients who received the assigned treatment. We 
used mixed-effects growth-curve modeling to 
evaluate linear and nonlinear changes from base-
line in health-related quality of life over time; this 
modeling adjusted for nonignorable missing data 
from quality-of-life questionnaires that were not 
completed.
Results
Patients
During the period from April 2007 through April 
2016, a total of 245 women were enrolled at eight 
participating centers in the Netherlands and Bel-
gium. The minimum number of events required 
for analysis of the primary end point was reached 
in April 2016, and efficacy data were updated in 
March 2017. Information on the enrollment, ran-
domization, treatment, and follow-up of the pa-
tients is shown in Figure 1. Demographic and 
baseline disease characteristics and surgical and 
treatment information for the two trial groups 
are shown in Table 1.
Efficacy
After a median follow-up of 4.7 years, 209 of the 
245 patients (85%) had had an event of disease 
recurrence or death; 137 of the 245 patients 
(56%) had died. In total, 83% of the recurrences 
were detected on the basis of imaging, irrespec-
tive of whether the patient had an increase from 
baseline in the CA-125 level, and 17% were de-
tected on the basis of an increase in the CA-125 
level alone. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 110 
of the 123 patients (89%) in the surgery group 
and 99 of the 122 patients (81%) in the surgery-
plus-HIPEC group had an event of disease recur-
rence or death (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.50 to 0.87; stratified P 
= 
0.003) 
(Fig. 2A). The median recurrence-free survival 
was 3.5 months longer in the group that under-
went cytoreduction surgery with HIPEC than in the 
group that underwent surgery alone (14.2 months 
vs. 10.7 months). The probability of recurrence-
free survival at 3 years was 8% in the surgery 
group (95% CI, 4 to 16) and 17% in the surgery-
plus-HIPEC group (95% CI, 11 to 26). Subgroup 
analyses of recurrence-free survival (Fig. 3) and 
overall survival (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix) showed that the effect of HIPEC was con-
sistent across the levels of prespecified stratifi-
cation factors and post hoc subgroups.
A total of 76 of the 123 patients (62%) in the 
surgery group and 61 of the 122 (50%) patients 
in the surgery-plus-HIPEC group died (hazard ra-
tio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.94; stratified P 
= 
0.02) 
(Fig. 2B). The median overall survival was 33.9 
months in the surgery group and 45.7 months in 
the surgery-plus-HIPEC group. The probability 
of overall survival at 3 years was 48% (95% CI, 
39 to 58) in the surgery group and 62% (95% CI, 
54 to 72) in the surgery-plus-HIPEC group.
Safety and Health-Related Quality of Life
The median duration of surgery was 192 minutes 
(interquartile range, 153 to 251) in the surgery 
group and 338 minutes (interquartile range, 299

than 95% of the patients in each group had at least 
one adverse event of any grade between random-

3 or 4 were abdominal pain, infection, and ileus 
(Table 2). One patient in the surgery group died 
within 30 days after undergoing surgery. A total 
of 59 patients — 30 in the surgery group and 29 
in the surgery-plus-HIPEC group — underwent 
bowel resection. Among the patients who under-
went bowel resection, a colostomy or ileostomy was 
performed more commonly among patients in 
the surgery-plus-HIPEC group (21 of 29 patients 
[72%]) than among those in the surgery group 
(13 of 30 patients [43%]) (P 
= 
0.04). The median 
total length of hospital admission was 8 days in 
the surgery group and 10 days in the surgery-plus-
HIPEC group, including 1 day in the intensive care 
unit (ICU), as required by the protocol. The median 
time between the completion of surgery and the 
restart of chemotherapy after surgery was similar 
in the two groups — 30 days in the surgery group 
and 33 days in the surgery-plus-HIPEC group. 
Rates of completion of all three cycles of chemo-
therapy after surgery were also similar in the two 
groups (90% and 94% in the surgery and surgery-
plus-HIPEC groups, respectively). A total of 11 pa-
tients in the surgery group and 9 in the surgery-
plus-HIPEC group had recurrent disease but 
received no further therapy. We observed no sig-
nificant differences between the two groups in 
health-related quality-of-life outcomes over time.
Discussion
After standard treatment for ovarian cancer, the 
peritoneal surface is the primary site of disease 
recurrence. Previous trials that compared six 
cycles of intraperitoneal chemotherapy plus in-
travenous chemotherapy with intravenous che-
motherapy alone after complete or optimal pri-
mary cytoreductive surgery showed that survival 
was 16 months longer after exposure to chemo-
therapy at the peritoneal surface than after intra-
venous chemotherapy alone.5,6,16 Nevertheless, the 
uptake of postoperative intravenous chemother-
apy plus intraperitoneal chemotherapy in clinical 
practice is limited by increased side effects, in-
cluding catheter-related complications, and the 
inconvenience of administering therapy intra-
peritoneally.7,17 In the current trial, we evaluated 
HIPEC as a single administration of intraperito-
neal chemotherapy during surgery to overcome 
the side effects and inconvenience of serial adju-
vant intraperitoneal chemotherapy and to improve 
the distribution of heated chemotherapy in the 
abdominal cavity.

Panel A shows Kaplan–Meier estimates of recurrence-free survival among 
patients in the intention-to-treat population. Events of disease recurrence 
or death were observed in 110 patients (89%) in the surgery group and in 
99 patients (81%) in the surgery-plus-HIPEC group. Panel B shows Kaplan–
Meier estimates of overall survival among patients in the intention-to-treat 
population. A total of 76 patients (62%) in the surgery group and 61 (50%) 
patients in the surgery-plus-HIPEC group died.

Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy
Although randomized trials support the use 
of HIPEC in colorectal cancer,15,18-20 previous evi-
dence of a beneficial effect of HIPEC in primary 
ovarian cancer has been limited to single-group 
trials and retrospective cohorts.12,13 In one previ-
ous trial involving patients with recurrent ovarian 
cancer who were randomly assigned to undergo 
cytoreductive surgery either with or without 
HIPEC, a significant survival benefit was observed 
among the patients who received HIPEC.21 How-
ever, the randomization process was not clearly 
described, and primary end points were not clearly 
defined.22 Our trial provides data from patients 
who were randomly assigned to undergo surgery 
with HIPEC or without HIPEC for the primary 
treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. Our find-
ings indicate that the addition of HIPEC to com-
plete or optimal interval cytoreductive surgery 
resulted in longer median recurrence-free sur-
vival, by 3.5 months, and longer median overall 
survival, by 11.8 months, than surgery alone. 
The effect was consistent across the levels of pre-
specified stratification factors and other baseline 
characteristics.
All the patients in our trial received neoadju-
vant chemotherapy. Postoperative care was simi-
lar in the two trial groups, with the exception of 
the care that the patients received during the 
1-day stay in the ICU after HIPEC that was pre-
specified in the protocol. The administration of 
HIPEC had little effect on safety, and the inci-
dence of postoperative complications, the inci-
dence and type of grade 3 or 4 adverse events, 
and health-related quality-of-life outcomes did 
not differ significantly between the surgery-plus-
HIPEC group and the surgery group. The reini-
tiation of intravenous chemotherapy after sur-
gery was not delayed in either trial group, and 
no effect of HIPEC on the number of cycles of 
chemotherapy administered was observed. A sin-
gle administration of intraperitoneal chemothera-
py under hyperthermic conditions differs from 
repeated postoperative administration of intra-
peritoneal chemotherapy with respect to pharma-
cokinetics and pharmacodynamics, which could 
explain the lower rate of systemic side effects 
seen with a single administration of intraperito-
neal chemotherapy than with a postoperative in-
travenous or intraperitoneal chemotherapy regi-
men.17 Additional trials are needed to determine 
Figure 3. Prespecified Subgroup Analyses of Recurrence-free Survival.
Histologic data were missing (i.e., no tumor sample was available for review) for one patient in each group. Histo-
logic type was determined on the basis of centrally reviewed pathological assessment. Previous surgery and the 
number of involved regions in the abdominal cavity were used as stratification factors at randomization. All the pa-
tients had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The size of each diamond is proportional to the amount of data 
available.

Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy
higher in the surgery-plus-HIPEC group than in 
the surgery group (72% vs. 43%, P 
= 
0.04). Be-
cause there is no evidence that HIPEC for ovarian 
cancer is associated with a higher rate of anas-
tomotic leakage than the rate without HIPEC, 
this difference in the rate of colostomy or ileos-
tomy could reflect the surgeons’ preference.
Randomization in our trial took place at the 
time of surgery in cases in which complete or 
optimal cytoreduction was anticipated. The in-
stitutional review board at each trial center ap-
proved this procedure, which ensured equality of 
prognosis between the trial groups at the actual 
time of the trial intervention, although for logis-
tic reasons, randomization was performed be-
fore the interval surgery at two of the centers on 
the basis of the results of a diagnostic laparos-
copy that was performed to determine whether 
complete or optimal surgery was feasible. When 
HIPEC is added to the surgical treatment, the 
duration of surgery is extended by 2 hours and a 
perfusionist is needed. Additional standard costs 
are incurred owing to the additional 2 hours of 
surgical time, the disposable products that are 
needed to administer HIPEC, the use of the 
HIPEC machine, and the 1-day stay in the ICU.
Our trial involved patients with prognostically 
unfavorable stage III ovarian cancer who were 
ineligible for primary cytoreduction owing to ex-
tensive abdominal disease. As a result, survival in 
the control group of our trial was shorter than 
that in the control group of the Gynecologic 
Oncology Group (GOG)–172 trial, which included 
only patients who were eligible for primary cyto-
reduction.5 The recurrence-free survival in our 
trial was also influenced by the definition of the 
primary end point, which included elevation of 
the CA-125 level as determined on the basis of 
GCIG criteria. When the protocol was designed, 
measurement of the CA-125 level during follow-
up was part of routine clinical practice. Howev-
er, if the definition of the primary end point had 
been based on clinical symptoms rather than on 
measurement of the CA-125 level, the estimated 
rate of recurrence would have been lower and 
the absolute prolongation of median recurrence-
free survival might have been greater.23
The median overall survival was 12 months 
longer among the patients who received HIPEC 
than among those who did not receive HIPEC, 
whereas the median recurrence-free survival was 
3.5 months longer with HIPEC than without 
HIPEC. However, the relative effects of HIPEC 
on recurrence-free survival and on overall sur-
vival were remarkably similar, with hazard ratios 
of 0.66 for recurrence-free survival and 0.67 for 
overall survival. The discrepancy between simi-
lar relative effects in overall survival and recur-
rence-free survival and a larger absolute benefit 
in overall survival than recurrence-free survival 
reflects the higher rate of disease recurrences 
than deaths. This finding was also shown in the 
GOG-172 trial, in which the difference between 
the trial groups in recurrence-free survival and in 
overall survival was 5.5 months and 15.9 months, 
respectively, both in favor of the intraperitoneal 
chemotherapy group.5 The number of patients 
who received no therapy for recurrent disease in 
the surgery group was similar to that in the sur-
gery-plus-HIPEC group and cannot explain the 
difference in absolute benefit between recurrence-
free survival and overall survival.
In conclusion, our results indicate that among 
women with advanced ovarian cancer, HIPEC plus 
complete or optimal interval cytoreductive surgery 
resulted in longer survival than cytoreductive sur-
gery alone.
