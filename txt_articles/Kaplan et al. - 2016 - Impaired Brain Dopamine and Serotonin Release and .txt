ABSTRACT: Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment, known also
as “chemobrain”, is a medical complication of cancer treatment that is
characterized by a general decline in cognition affecting visual and verbal
memory, attention, complex problem solving skills, and motor function. It
is estimated that one-third of patients who undergo chemotherapy
treatment will experience cognitive impairment. Alterations in the release
and uptake of dopamine and serotonin, central nervous system
neurotransmitters that play important roles in cognition, could potentially
contribute to impaired intellectual performance in those impacted by
chemobrain. To investigate how chemotherapy treatment affects these
systems, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) at carbon-fiber micro-
electrodes was used to measure dopamine and serotonin release and
uptake in coronal brain slices containing the striatum and dorsal raphe
nucleus, respectively. Measurements were taken from rats treated weekly
with selected doses of carboplatin and from control rats treated with saline. Modeling the stimulated dopamine release plots
revealed an impairment of dopamine release per stimulus pulse (80% of saline control at 5 mg/kg and 58% at 20 mg/kg) after 4
weeks of carboplatin treatment. Moreover, Vmax, the maximum uptake rate of dopamine, was also decreased (55% of saline
control at 5 mg/kg and 57% at 20 mg/kg). Nevertheless, overall dopamine content, measured in striatal brain lysates by high
performance liquid chromatography, and reserve pool dopamine, measured by FSCV after pharmacological manipulation, did not
significantly change, suggesting that chemotherapy treatment selectively impairs the dopamine release and uptake processes.
Similarly, serotonin release upon electrical stimulation was impaired (45% of saline control at 20 mg/kg). Measurements of
spatial learning discrimination were taken throughout the treatment period and carboplatin was found to alter cognition. These
studies support the need for additional neurochemical and behavioral analyses to identify the underlying mechanisms of
chemotherapy-induced cognitive disorders.

A
djuvant chemotherapy has long been a key treatment
strategy for either eradicating or slowing the proliferation
of cancer cells. Unfortunately, chemotherapeutic treatment
approaches, while effective in killing cancer cells, are also toxic
to other cell populations in the body. This toxicity has been
addressed by redesigning chemotherapeutic compounds to
maximize effective treatment and minimize the harmful impact.
Nevertheless, chemotherapy still leads to multiple side effects
that decrease patients’ quality of life not only during treatment,
but also long after the treatment has concluded. Cells in the
central nervous system (CNS) are particularly vulnerable to the
effects of chemotherapy. This vulnerability applies to both
dividing and nondividing cell populations after both localized
and peripheral treatment with chemotherapy.1−7
Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment, also known as
“chemobrain”, is a syndrome caused by the toxicity of
chemotherapy agents to the CNS.8 Improvements in treatment
and early detection capabilities have improved the survivability
of many cancers, especially breast cancer. With this improved
survival rate, the identification of postchemotherapy cognitive
impairment has increased dramatically. About 18% of breast
cancer patients that receive standard chemotherapy treatment9
and 30% of all cancer patients that receive high level
chemotherapy treatment experience chemobrain.10 Another
report suggests that up to one-third of females who have

symptoms of chemobrain.11 These symptoms include loss of
verbal and visual memory, a decrease in mental flexibility,
attention deficits, and a loss of motor function.12,13
Although the underlying causes of chemobrain are still
unknown, a variety of mechanisms have been proposed. One
possibility is that the expression of genes that heighten the
probability of getting cancer may also increase the likelihood
for vulnerability to the negative side effects of chemotherapy
treatment.14 These genetic factors include blood-brain barrier
dysfunction, impaired DNA repair mechanisms, and dysregu-
lation of the immune system.14−18 It has also been proposed
that chemotherapy-induced DNA damage can lead to an
increase in cytokine production that promotes a chronic state of
inflammation leading to cognitive impairments.19−23 Chemo-
brain may also be caused, in part, by the disruption of blood
flow throughout the vasculature of the brain. This phenomenon
could result in ischemia, which may directly affect cognition
due to oxidative stress.24 Moreover, it has been suggested that
the inherent toxicity of many chemotherapeutic agents may
impair neurotransmitter signaling.14 Both dividing and non-
dividing progenitor cells and oligodendrocytes in the brain have
also been shown to be highly sensitive to some chemo-
therapeutics, even more so than the cancer itself.25
Dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) are CNS neuro-
transmitters involved in a variety of neurological functions. DA
plays roles in reward,26 cognition,27 and locomotor control.27
Alterations in DA system function have been observed in
response to chemically induced oxidative insult,28 genetic
modifications that model oxidative stress,29 and neurodegener-
ative disease.28,30−35 Serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in
mood and cognition, as well as other neurological
functions.36−38 Similar to the case of DA, functional alterations
of the 5-HT system have been observed both in models of
oxidative stress39 and neurodegenerative disease.39,40 Therefore,
we hypothesized that treatment with chemotherapeutic agents
would impair DA and 5-HT release. The identification of such
impairments would have important consequences for the
cognitive processes that involve DA and 5-HT signaling, as
well as imply that signaling by other neurotransmitter systems
also may be affected.
Carboplatin (cis-diammine(1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylato)-
platinum(II)), a chemotherapeutic agent commonly employed
in the treatment of various cancers, including those of the head,
neck, breast, ovaries, bladder, and colon,40−42 has become a
common alternative to cisplatin, which had caused severe side
effects during and after treatment.43 Despite its reduced
toxicity, carboplatin has also been implicated in chemo-
brain.8,44,45 To assess the effects of carboplatin treatment on
the function of dopaminergic and serotonergic terminals, male
Wistar rats were injected intravenously with carboplatin once a
week for 4 weeks. Measurements of electrically evoked DA
release and uptake, measured with FSCV in coronal brain slices,
revealed that release was impaired even though reserve pool
DA and the total content of DA were unchanged. Furthermore,
Vmax was diminished, indicating that the uptake process is
negatively impacted by exposure to carboplatin. Similar to DA,
stimulated 5-HT release was also impaired. Moreover, spatial
learning measurements in operant conditioning chambers
revealed that carboplatin treatment altered cognitive function.
These findings provide insight into how a commonly used
chemotherapeutic agent impacts subsecond neurotransmitter
release and uptake dynamics, and suggest its involvement in
chemobrain.
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Striatal Dopamine Release. Impairments in the release of
DA, 5-HT, glutamate, GABA, and other neurotransmitters
could be detrimental to many neurological functions, including
cognition, mood, and the control of movement. Clinical studies

 have suggested that DA may play a role in chemobrain.46,47
Additionally, preclinical research implies the involvement of DA
impairment in chemobrain.14,47−51 It has been well-established
that dopaminergic function in the basal ganglia is important in
cognition.27,52−57 Therefore, we investigated the release and
uptake properties of DA, which are readily measured
electrochemically with FSCV.
The striatum was divided into four quadrants in the coronal
plane, and electrically stimulated DA release and uptake were
quantified in the quadrants. The dorsal striatum is associated
with motivation and reward as well as motor function58,59
whereas the ventral striatum has shown an association with
reinforcement learning.60 Measurements were taken in the four
quadrants to account for potential regional differences in
release, which are known to have a dorsal to ventral gradient in
multiple rodent species and nonhuman primates.61
Electrically stimulated DA release in the dorsal lateral (DL),
dorsal medial (DM), ventral medial (VM), and ventral lateral
(VL) quadrants of the striatum was measured with FSCV in
coronal brain slices (Figure 1A). Four measurements were
taken at random locations within each quadrant and averaged.
Representative data for 0, 5, and 20 mg/kg carboplatin
treatment groups are shown in Figure 1B. The representative
cyclic voltammograms indicate that the analyte measured was
DA. Each color plot consists of a series of unfolded, stacked
cyclic voltammograms. The current response is color-coded (z-
axis). The absence of faradaic currents, other than those due to
DA oxidation and reduction, suggest that no additional
electroactive species are released in response to electrical
stimulation in either the brain slices from carboplatin-naïve
animals or from 20 mg/kg carboplatin-treated animals.

 The presence of DA was confirmed by the cyclic voltammo-
grams sampled at the point of peak release on each plot. There
was no significant effect of region on stimulated DA release
(Figure 2A). Given the lack of regional effects, DA levels were
averaged across striatal quadrants, revealing a statistically
significant carboplatin treatment effect on DA release in the
striatum (detailed statistical information can be found in the
Supporting Information): 72 ± 10% of vehicle control at 5 mg/
kg and 41 ± 7% % at 20 mg/kg (Figure 2B). The attenuation of
DA release was, therefore, found to be generalized throughout
the entire striatum. Since DA is involved in motor function and
cognition,25 it is possible that the symptoms of chemobrain,
such as short-term memory loss and fatigue, could be
influenced by a generalized depression of the release of
dopamine into the striatal synapses for chemotherapy treated
patients.27,62,63 However, the suppression of other neuronal
populations, including GABAergic neurons and glutamatergic
neurons, cannot be ruled out.
Determination of [DA]p and Vmax. To quantify DA uptake
in carboplatin-treated rats, the stimulated release plots were
modeled. This modeling process allowed the determination of
Vmax, the maximum rate of DA uptake, and [DA]p, DA release
per electrical stimulus pulse. The determination of [DA]p
corrects for electrode performance and DA uptake by the
dopamine transporter that occurs concomitant with stimulated
release. The curve-fitting process is described in Methods, and a
representative fit of a stimulated release plot is shown in Figure
3A. A statistically significant attenuation in [DA]p was found
across all regions of the striatum after 4 weeks of carboplatin
treatment: 67 ± 10% of saline control at 5 mg/kg and 44 ± 8%
at 20 mg/kg (Figure 3B and C). Similar to the uncorrected
release data in which [DA]max was determined, no significant
effect was found between the four regions of the striatum
probed. Additionally, a substantial effect of carboplatin dose on
Vmax (Figure 3D and E) was found: 55 ± 9% of saline control at
5 mg/kg and 57 ± 8% at 20 mg/kg. Similar to the [DA]p data,
there was no statistical difference in Vmax between the regions of
the striatum sampled. To illustrate the overall effect of
carboplatin treatment on striatal DA release within the striatum,
graphical representations of [DA]p and Vmax are shown in

 Figure 3C and E, respectively, with these values averaged across
the four quadrants.
These data show that DA per pulse, as well as DA uptake, is
diminished in carboplatin-treated rats. These findings suggest
that the decrease in stimulated DA release that occurred in
response to electrical stimulation did not arise from enhanced
DA clearance, given the competitive relationship between DA
release and uptake, by the dopamine transport system.
According to Michaelis−Menten kinetics, Vmax is directly
proportional to the number of dopamine transporter protein
molecules.64 Therefore, it is possible that the total number of
functioning dopaminergic terminals decreases with carboplatin
treatmenta finding that is not surprising given the inherent
toxicity of carboplatin. It is important, however, to obtain
measures of how much DA is present within the terminals since
this parameter would be a measure of how much DA is
available for release.
Striatal Dopamine Content. Striatal tissue samples were
analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
with electrochemical detection to measure the total content of
DA and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) (Table 1).
We found no significant dose effect of carboplatin treatment on
DA content (one-way ANOVA, p > 0.05; 0, 5, and 20 mg/kg, n
= 5), DOPAC content (one-way ANOVA, p > 0.05; 0, 5, and
20 mg/kg, n = 5 rats per group), or DA/DOPAC (one-way
ANOVA, p > 0.05; 0, 5, and 20 mg/kg, n = 5 rats per group) in
striatal tissue samples. Several conclusions can be drawn from
these data. First, since DOPAC levels, as well as the DA/
DOPAC ratio, did not change with carboplatin treatment, it is
unlikely that the metabolism of DA to DOPAC is altered by
exposure to this chemotherapeutic agent. Second, these results
suggest that overall DA content is not affected by chronic
treatment with carboplatin. Thus, DA is present in proper
amounts in carboplatin treated rats, but it is not released
efficiently.
Dopamine Reserve Pool Content. The generalized three-
pool model of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles within
neurons consists of a readily releasable pool, a recycling pool,
and a reserve pool.65−67 The readily releasable pool represents
only 1−2% of vesicles within a neuron.67 In the context of
voltammetric recordings, DA from the readily releasable pool in
striatal slices is released and detected by FSCV upon
application of a single electrical stimulus pulse. After depleting
the readily releasable pool of vesicles, these vesicles are
replenished by the recycling pool, which accounts for 5−20% of
the total number of vesicles within neurons.68−70 The reserve
pool constitutes 80−90% of the total vesicles within neurons
and is thought to be mobilized in response to increased levels
of synaptic activity.65−67
Experimentally, reserve pool DA can be mobilized by intense
electrical stimulation29,31,70−72 or pharmacological manipula-
tion.31,72 Here, we isolated the reserve pool of DA in striatal
brain slices from saline-treated (see raw data in Figure 4A) and
carboplatin-treated (see raw data in Figure 4B) rats by blocking
DA synthesis with α-methyl-p-tyrosine methyl ester (αMPT)
while applying single-pulse electrical stimulations every 5 min.31
The compound αMPT inhibits DA production by blocking
tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in DA syn-
thesis.73 When αMPT was present in the perfusion buffer, the
DA signal decreased in response to repeated stimulation,
leaving only the reserve pool of DA within the terminals. The
signal dissipation from 100% to 10% was not significantly
different between slices from carboplatin-treated rats and
vehicle-treated rats (carboplatin, 120.0 ± 2.3 min, n = 5 rats;
vehicle, 140.8 ± 19.1 min, n = 6 rats; p = 0.50, unpaired t test),
suggesting that releasable DA vesicles are present in similar
amounts across the two groups.
Subsequent application of AMPH, in the continued presence
of αMPT, resulted in the spontaneous, quantifiable efflux of
reserve pool of DA. The concentration of DA measured as a
result of αMPTand AMPH treatment was 2.6 ± 0.5 μM in
brain slices prepared from control rats and 2.5 ± 0.6 μM in
slices from 20 mg/kg carboplatin-treated rats (Figure 4C).
There was no significant difference in this DA efflux (unpaired t
test, p > 0.05, n = 6 control rats and 5 rats treated with 20 mg/
kg carboplatin), suggesting that the mechanism leading to
stimulated DA attenuation in the striatum is not based on
storage impairment.
Additionally, the physical striatal area was not grossly altered
by carboplatin treatment (Figure 1, Supporting Information),
suggesting that the striatum and DA terminals have not
undergone significant atrophy.
Given these DA content results, we conclude that evoked
release is not diminished due to a decrease in overall tissue
content or reserve pool. Thus, DA is present in the terminals;
however, it is likely that the ability of neurons to release it is
impaired.
Dorsal Raphe Serotonin Release. To examine further the
mechanism underlying chemobrain, we also measured the
stimulated release of 5-HT within the dorsal raphe nucleus.
Serotonin plays a vital role in cognition, including memory and
learning processes74,75 and synaptic plasticity.76 Furthermore,
the interplay between 5-HT and other neurotransmitter
systems, including DA, has been shown.77,78 Due to the
specific involvement in cognition and interplay with the DA
system, we chose to study electrically stimulated 5-HT release
in the dorsal raphe nucleus by FSCV. Five measurements were
taken within the dorsal raphe from each brain slice and
averaged. Representative data from the 0 and 20 mg/kg
carboplatin treatment groups are shown in Figure 5A. The
representative cyclic voltammograms indicate that the analyte

 measured is 5-HT. As shown in Figure 5B, the peak
concentration of serotonin released following electrical
stimulation was significantly diminished in 20 mg/kg
carboplatin-treated rats compared to saline-treated rats (45 ±
9% of saline control, n = 5 carboplatin-treated and 5 vehicle-
treated rats, p < 0.05, unpaired t test).
Our results suggest that impaired 5-HT release may
contribute to the cognitive deficits experienced by patients
who have undergone chemotherapy treatment. Taken together
with DA release impairments, these results indicate that
chemotherapy may induce a general effect upon the mechanism
of neurotransmitter release. Thus, it is likely that the release of
other neurotransmitters, such as glutamate and GABA, is
impaired; consequently, the impact of these deficits on
cognitive function should also be considered.
Spatial Learning Measurements. To test for carboplatin
related deficits in spatial learning, rats were evaluated on a
spatial learning paradigm in which five response options (i.e.,
nose-pokes detected by infrared beam) were presented in a
horizontal row. When the rats poked their noses to a target
preselected by the investigator, a food reward was delivered.
This paradigm consistently results in Gaussian response
distributions centered on the target location, with steeper
Gaussian functions indicating more robust spatial learning.79
Figure 6 shows the spread of responses to nontarget nose pokes
(A), responses at the nontarget positions, 2 and 4 (B), overall
rates of nose pokes (C), and rats’ weights during the testing
phase (D). As can be seen, the responses to nontarget nose
poke locations (expressed as a proportion of the rate of nose
pokes on the target location) fit well into a Gaussian function
for rats treated with saline (r2 = 0.99) and 20 mg/kg
carboplatin (r2 = 0.96). The parameters for these Gaussian
functions significantly differed between groups (F[2,64] =
4.339, p < 0.05). Moreover, t test of responding at individual
targets found that the proportion of target responses on nose
poke location 2 (t[60] = 2.0651, p < 0.05) and 4 (t[60] =
2.41287, p < 0.05) differed significantly between carboplatin-
and vehicle-treated rats (Figure 6B). No significant differences
were obtained for overall rate of nose pokes (Figure 6C; p =
0.65) or rats’ weights during the testing phase (Figure 6D; p =
0.29).
Consistent with the neurochemical data, a treatment course
of carboplatin resulted in altered cognitive function. Here,
carboplatin resulted in small but significant alterations in spatial
learning/memory that resulted in increased responding to
nontarget nose poke locations on a spatial learning paradigm.
The degree of cognitive impairment observed following
carboplatin treatment is consistent with chemotherapy patients’
symptoms, which often present as subtle impairments in
parameters such as learning, concentration, reasoning, and
executive function.8 An important aspect of these cognitive
measurements is that the overall rates of responding did not
significantly differ between carboplatin- and vehicle-treated
groups (p > 0.05). Additionally, rats did not lose weight during
or after treatment, suggesting that food consumption and
general feeling of well-being was not impacted. Taken together,
these results strongly suggest that the decreased responding of
carboplatin-treated rats on locations 2 and 4 was not due
merely to a detriment of overall health, but rather to the more
specific effect of cognitive impairment.
■ CONCLUSIONS
To our knowledge, this is the first published study that
investigates dopamine and serotonin release alterations
occurring as a result of chemotherapeutic drug administration.
We found an impairment of striatal DA release and uptake in
response to treatment with carboplatin that were not
accompanied by significant regional differences in this
attenuation. Thus, DA release impairment was generalized
across the entire striatum. Because Vmax was diminished, it is
unlikely that the decrease in stimulated DA measured was a
result of enhanced clearance. DA reserve pool content and
overall content of DA were unaffected by treatment. Therefore,
we conclude that DA is present in the striatum, but it is not
released as efficiently. We also showed that 5-HT release was
impaired in carboplatin-treated rats, suggesting that multiple
neurotransmitter systems are altered as a result of chemo-

and 4 (B), overall rates of nose pokes (C), and rats’ weights during the

 therapy treatment. Moreover, our spatial learning paradigm
result indicate that carboplatin treatment results in cognitive
impairment of these rats.
The particular mechanisms underlying neurotransmitter
release impairments following carboplatin treatment have not
yet been identified. However, it is possible that multiple factors
contribute, including influences by other neurotransmitters and
neuromodulators that have become dysregulated due to
carboplatin treatment, damage to proteins that mediate
exocytosis, and morphological degradation of neuronal
terminals. In future studies it will be important to address
these issues to identify specific cellular mechanisms that
contribute to release impairment. Additionally, it will be critical
to design behavioral and neurochemical experiments so that we
can determine the relevance of neurotransmitter release
alterations in specific brain regions, such as the striatum and
dorsal raphe nucleus, to cognitive ability.
In summary, our spatial learning paradigm results indicate a
decrease in cognitive performance; thus, it is possible that
diminished neurotransmitter release capability negatively
impacts cognitive ability. Collectively, these findings (1) suggest
neurotransmitter release impairment as a possible mechanism
of cognitive dysfunction in patients treated with chemo-
therapeutic agents and (2) support the need for more refined
behavioral and neurochemical analyses to elucidate how release
is impaired and which neurotransmitter systems are affected.
■ METHODS
Animals. All experiments were carried out in accordance with the
National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals. All procedures were approved by the University of Kansas
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Male Wistar rats
(Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Wilmington, MA) were housed two
or three per cage in the University of Kansas Animal Care Unit. Food
and water was available ad libitum. Rats were maintained on a 12 h
light/dark cycle with lights on at 6:00 AM and lights out at 6:00 PM. A
temperature of 70 ± 2 °C and humidity level of 50 ± 20% were
maintained. Rats were approximately 9 weeks old upon arrival. For
neurochemical measurements, rats were 10 weeks old at time of first
treatment with carboplatin or saline and 14 weeks old at the time of
analysis with FSCV. For behavioral measurements, rats were about 12
weeks old at time of carboplatin treatment. A total of 43 rats were used
for neurochemical measurements and 14 rats were used for spatial
learning measurements to allow sufficient statistical power for each
analysis. All behavioral sessions were conducted during the light phase
on the light-dark cycle.
Drugs. Carboplatin (lot number C2538), d-amphetamine sulfate
(lot number 065 K1894), and α-methyl-DL-tyrosine methyl ester
hydrochloride (lot number 037 K1402) were purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). For reserve pool measurements, AMPH was
dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (0.9% NaCl, 2.5 mg/mL) prior
to use. For all 5-HT and reserve pool DA experiments, pharmaceutical
grade carboplatin (lot number 61703-339-50) was purchased from
Hospira (Lake Forest, IL).
Electrode Fabrication. Carbon-fiber cylindrical microelectrodes
were fabricated as previously described.28,80 Briefly, individual 7 μm
carbon fibers, purchased from Goodfellow Cambridge Ltd. (Hunting-
don, England), were loaded into glass capillaries (4 in, 1.2 mm OD; A-
M Systems, Inc. Carlsborg, WA) and pulled using a heated coil puller
(Narishige International USA, East Meadow, NY). Carbon-fiber tips
were then cut with a scalpel 25 μm from the end of the glass seal.
Electrodes were sealed by dipping into a well-mixed epoxy mixture of
0.24 g of EPI-CURE 3234 Curing Agent (lot FCXC4114/0886GG)
and 2.00 g of EPON Resin 815C (lot HADN0003/1307GG). Excess
resin was removed by dipping several times in toluene, and electrodes
were then baked for 1 h at 100 °C. The electrodes were backfilled with
0.5 M potassium acetate to establish electrical connections between
the carbon-fibers and the inserted silver wires. For 5-HT detection,
electrodes were coated with Nafion (Nafion perfluorinated ion-
exchange resin, 5 wt % solution in a mixture of lower aliphatic alcohols
and water, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) via electrodeposition using
an adaptation of previously described methods.81,82 Electrodes were
dipped in Nafion, and a potential of 1.0 V was applied for 30 s. Nafion-
coated electrodes were then cured at 70 °C for 10 min and stored for
no longer than 1 week prior to use.
Chemotherapy Treatment. Male Wistar rats received one
injection (iv, tail vein) of carboplatin once a week for four consecutive
weeks. All carboplatin solutions were made up in saline (2.5 and 15
mg/mL) prior to injection. There were three experimental groups that
included treatments with 0.9% biological saline, 5.0 mg/kg carboplatin,
and 20 mg/kg carboplatin. Both dosage and treatment regimen were
chosen to mimic clinical dosing regimens and to allow the drug effects
to stabilize. Although the dose of carboplatin varies dramatically in a
clinical setting, a 20 mg/kg dose of carboplatin, which corresponds to a
clinical dose of 120 mg/m2,83 falls within the middle of a typical dose
range in humans.84
To examine further the effect of carboplatin treatment on DA
reserve pool efflux and stimulated 5-HT release, Male Wistar rats
received one injection (iv, tail vein) of carboplatin once a week for four
consecutive weeks. For this round of treatment, there were two
experimental groups consisting of treatment with 0.9% biological
saline or a 20 mg/kg dose of pharmaceutical grade carboplatin (10
mg/mL, Hospira, Inc.).
Brain Slices. Brain slices were harvested as previously described.32
Briefly, rats were deeply anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation and
decapitated. The brain was then immediately removed and placed into
ice-cold artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF). The aCSF solution
contained the following concentrations: 2.5 mM KCl, 126 mM NaCl,
1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 25 mM NaHCO3, 2.4 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgCl2,
20 mM HEPES, 11 mM D-glucose. The pH was adjusted to 7.4. To
ensure the tissue received ample oxygen, the aCSF was continuously
bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2 throughout the experiment. After
chilling for 1 min, the cerebellum was removed and the brain was
bisected longitudinally using a sterile razor blade. The striatum was
dissected from the sample and was stored at −80 °C and saved for
HPLC analysis. The other hemisphere of the brain was then glued to a
plate against a cube of agar for support. Several 300 μm coronal brain
slices were then obtained using a vibratome (Leica Microsystems,
Bannockburn, IL). In a typical recording session, a single striatal brain
slice was transferred to a perfusion chamber where oxygenated aCSF,
maintained at 34 °C using a thermostated perfusion chamber and in-
line heater, flowed over the slice at 2 mL/min. For all 5-HT release
measurements, brain slices containing the dorsal raphe were obtained
and transferred to a perfusion chamber using the method described.
Slices were equilibrated for at least 1 h before collecting measure-
ments.
Striatal Area Measurements. After tissue harvesting, coronal
slices containing the striatum was transferred to a Petri dish containing
aCSF. A glass slide was immediately placed on top of the slice to
prevent the tissue from curling. The slice was then placed under a
stereomicroscope (Nikon SMZ745, Japan). Brain slices were imaged
by an eyepiece camera (AmScope MU300, Irvine, CA) mounted on
the stereomicroscope. The striatum was selected and outlined as show
in Supplemental Figure 1 using Photoshop CS6 (Adobe, San Jose,
CA). The area of the striatum in pixels was determined and converted
to cm2 via calibration (See Supporting Information Figure 1).
Electrochemical Measurements Using FSCV. Procedures for
measuring DA and 5-HT release and uptake with background-
subtracted FSCV have been described in detail previously.31,32,82,85
Briefly, a precalibrated cylinder carbon-fiber microelectrode was
inserted 100 μm into the brain slice using micromanipulators and a
stereoscope. The electrode was positioned between two biphasic
stimulating electrodes (A-M Systems Inc., Carlsborg, WA) in the
striatum. For DA detection, triangular waveform starting at −0.4 V,
scanning up to +1.0 V, and back to −0.4 V, was applied to the carbon-
fiber microelectrode at a scan rate of 300 V/s and an update rate of 10
Hz. For 5-HT detection, a waveform of +0.2 V, up to +1.0 V, down to

 −0.1 V and back up to +0.2 V was applied at a scan rate of 800 V/s
and an update rate of 10 Hz. An Ag/AgCl reference electrode was
used. DA release was evoked by applying a single, biphasic current
pulse (current of 350 μA, 4 ms total duration) to the stimulating
electrode. The peak current after stimulation was used for all release
measurements. The current measured from DA oxidation was plotted
versus potential and the successive voltammograms were plotted
versus time. To account the for the natural heterogeneity of DA
release in the striatum, measurements were taken in four different
regions of the striatum four times, therefore obtaining 16 measure-
ments at unique positions for each slice. Two or three slices were
analyzed per rat.
To monitor reserve pool dopamine efflux, single pulse measure-
ments were taken every 5 min while treating the brain slice with
αMPT. These measurements were taken until stimulated DA release
was completely diminished. At this point, the brain slice was perfused
with 20 μM AMPH and 50 μM αMPT. DA release was then
continuously measured for 25 min without electrical stimulation.
Modeling Stimulated Release Plots. Dopamine release and
uptake kinetics were analyzed using modeling software written by R.M.
Wightman (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). This
modeling software was used to measure dopamine per pulse ([DA]p),
which is dopamine release per electrical stimulus corrected for
electrode performance and uptake, and Vmax, which is the maximum
rate of dopamine uptake. The time of stimulation is loaded into the
software; however, the actual rise in the DA oxidation current typically
does not occur immediately after stimulation. This delay, which may
be on the order of 100 ms, is influenced by several factors, including
the time it takes for DA to diffuse to the electroactive surface and
adsorption of DA to the electrode surface. The mechanism of DA
reuptake has been well-defined previously.30 Briefly, DA uptake obeys

where extracellular dopamine, (DA)o, is converted to intracellular

where [DA] represents the extracellular concentration of DA in the
brain, [DA]p is the change in [DA] at the electrode surface in response
to each electrical stimulus pulse, and Vmax and KM are constants in the
Michaelis−Menten equation that describe how the transporter
functions.64 A KM value of 0.2 μM was used during the modeling
operation. The parameters Vmax and [DA]p were then adjusted to fit
the traces, as shown in Figure 3A.
Striatal Dopamine Content. Striatal tissue samples were stored at
−80 °C until use. Samples were homogenized in 0.1 M perchloric acid
and centrifuged at 7200g for 10 min. The same day dopamine tissue
content was determined using HPLC coupled with electrochemical
detection. The supernatant was manually injected onto a Phenomenex
Luna 2.5u C18(2)-HST column (100 × 3.00 mm) for separation
followed by detection using an ESA 5014B microdialysis cell (E1 =
−150 mV; E2 = +230 mV). A guard cell (ESA 5020) was used in-line
before the injection loop and was set at +350 mV. The mobile phase
was delivered at a flow rate of 0.38 mL/min by a Shimadzu LC-20AD
HPLC pump (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD). The
mobile phase composition was: 75.2 mM sodium phosphate
(monobasic, monohydrate), 1.39 mM 1-octanesulfonic acid (sodium
salt, anhydrous), 0.125 mM ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, 0.0025%
triethylamine, and 10% acetonitrile; pH 3.0 adjusted with 85%
phosphoric acid. Dopamine peak areas were integrated and quantified
against known standards using LC Solutions Shimadzu Software.
Dopamine levels were normalized to total protein levels as determined
(in duplicate) by the commercially available BCA protein assay kit
from Thermo Scientific (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham,
MA). Final values were reported as μg dopamine/mg protein.
Spatial Learning Measurements. Deficits in learning and
memory are commonly reported after patients undergo chemo-
therapy.89−91 Moreover, neuropsychological testing has found impair-
ments in visuo-spatial skills up to one year after treatment.92 As a
result, behavioral testing paradigms designed to identify these common
clinical concerns in laboratory rodents must provide a robust and face
valid test of any proposed neurobiological mechanism thought to
cause chemobrain. Unfortunately, the behavioral paradigms primarily
applied to chemobrain poorly address the learning processes disrupted
in chemobrain. Many of the paradigms test simple associative
learning,7−9 which falls short of the complexity entailed in the
cognitive deficits seen in chemobrain.
Within an operant learning framework, if an organism is reinforced
for responding on a particular target within a horizontally arranged
array, patterns of responding are Gaussian in form and centered on the
target response.79 These generalization gradients are consistently
observed, with spatial learning failures manifest as wider and less
focused gradients.93 The present experiment examined these general-
ization gradients in rats treated with carboplatin versus saline vehicle.
Sessions occurred in operant conditioning chambers (33.0 cm long,
24.1 cm wide, 29.2 cm high; Med Associates, Inc., St. Albans, VT).
The rear wall was curved with five (2.54 cm × 2.54 cm) nose poke
receptacles fitted with stimulus lights and infrared sensors 2.54 cm
apart arranged horizontally 2 cm from the floor. Centered on the front
wall, 2 cm above the floor grid was a pellet receptacle (3 cm × 4 cm)
into which a pellet dispenser could dispense grain based pellets (45
mg; Bio-Serv, Frenchtown, NJ). A 28 V DC houselight centered on
the back wall (26.7 cm from the floor) provided general illumination.
Chambers were housed in sound attenuating cubicles with fans to
mask extraneous noise. All experimental events were programed and
recorded using MED-PC IV software controlled by a PC.
Sessions occurred 6 days a week at approximately the same time
each day and ended either after the rats earned 100 reinforcers or 1 h
had passed. At the beginning of each session, the house light and the
stimulus lights in each of the five nose poke receptacles was turned on.
In each session, one of the five nose pokes was made active.
Specifically, triggering the infrared sensor in that receptacle resulted in
a brief tone (0.1 s), the extinguishing of all nose poke cue lights for 5 s,
the lighting of the pellet receptacle, and the delivery of one 45 mg
pellet. Responding on the other four nose poke receptacles was
recorded but did not result in any differential consequences. The target
nose poke remained constant for each session, with the order of
conditions varying quasi-randomly.
Statistics. Statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad
Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). For
statistical analyses, N = the number of rats. Data are reported as means
