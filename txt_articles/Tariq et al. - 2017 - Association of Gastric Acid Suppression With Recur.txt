IMPORTANCE Gastric acid suppression has been associated with an increased risk of primary
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), but the risk of recurrent CDI in patients taking gastric acid
suppressant medications is unclear.
OBJECTIVE To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association
between gastric acid suppressants and recurrent CDI.
DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register, the Cochrane Database,
and Web of Science were searched from January 1, 1995, to September 30, 2015, for studies
assessing the association between gastric acid suppressant exposure and recurrent CDI.
Search terms included Clostridium difficile, pseudomembranous colitis, proton pump inhibitor,
and histamine H2 blocker.
STUDY SELECTION Case-control studies, cohort studies, and clinical trials that included
patients with CDI who did or did not receive gastric acid suppressant therapy and who were
evaluated for recurrent CDI were included, with no restriction on study setting (inpatient or
outpatient).
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the
methodologic quality of included studies. In this scale, case-control and cohort studies were
scored on selection, comparability, and ascertainment of the outcome of interest. Data were
independently abstracted to a predetermined collection form by 2 investigators. Summary
odds ratio estimates with 95% CIs were calculated using the random-effects model and
software to calculate the pooled effect size of studies reporting multivariate analyses.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Risk of recurrent infection in patients with CDI and its
association with use of gastric acid suppressant medication.
RESULTS Sixteen observational studies were included, together reporting 7703 patients with
CDI; among these, 1525 patients (19.8%) developed recurrent CDI. The rate of recurrent CDI
in patients with gastric acid suppression was 22.1% (892 of 4038 patients) compared with
17.3% (633 of 3665) in patients without gastric acid suppression, which indicated an
increased risk by meta-analysis (odds ratio [OR], 1.52; 95% CI, 1.20-1.94; P < .001). There was
significant heterogeneity among the studies, with an I2 value of 64%. Subgroup analyses of
studies adjusting for age and potential confounders confirmed an increased risk of recurrent
CDI with use of gastric acid suppressants (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.08-1.76; P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Meta-analyses of observational studies suggest that patients
who receive gastric acid suppressants may be at increased risk for recurrent CDI. These data
should be interpreted with caution because they may be confounded owing to the
observational design of the individual studies. It may be reasonable to re-evaluate the need
for these medications in patients with CDI.

lostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most common
cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea and has recently
shownincreasingincidence,severity,andmorbidityand
mortality rates.1-3 A substantial proportion of CDI cases (up to
40%) are community acquired in patients who were previ-
ously thought to be at low risk, which suggests the presence
of new risk factors.4-6 Novel risk factors for CDI development
include the use of gastric acid suppressants, presence of sys-
temiccomorbidconditions,Cdifficilecarriageinwaterandfood
sources, and close contact with patients with CDI in the com-
munity. These factors show the importance of environment-
to-person and direct person-to-person transmission.3,5,7

Methods
All procedures used in this meta-analysis were consistent with
the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
criteria21 for observational studies and the Preferred Report-
ing Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guide-
lines for randomized clinical trials.22
Selection Criteria
The studies considered in this meta-analysis were case-
control studies, cohort studies, and clinical trials that
included a population of patients with CDI who did or did
not receive gastric acid suppressant therapy (either PPIs or
H2Bs) and evaluated the occurrence of recurrent CDI, with
no restrictions on study setting (inpatient or outpatient). We
excluded studies that did not evaluate recurrent CDI as an
outcome. Studies were also excluded from meta-analyses
if there were insufficient data to determine an estimate of
an odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI. Studies with published full
text were included, and those only in abstract form were
excluded.
Data Sources and Search Strategy
We conducted a comprehensive search of Ovid MEDLINE
In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE,
Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web
of Science, and Scopus from January 1, 1995, to September 30,
2015.Thesearchstrategywasindependentlydesignedandcon-
ducted by study investigators (R.T. and S.K.) and the Mayo
Clinic library staff. The search was limited to studies pub-
lished in English. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with
key words was used to search for studies of PPI and H2B use
and CDI. The main key words used in the search were Clos-
tridium difficile, C diff, C difficile, Clostridium difficile infec-
tion, CDI, Clostridium difficile–associated diarrhea or CDAD,
or pseudomembranous colitis; and proton pump inhibitor, pro-
tonpumpinhibitors,PPI,PPIs,protonpump,histamine2blocker,
H2 blocker or gastric acid suppression, and acid suppressive
therapy; and outcomes, recurrence, reinfection, relapse, or re-
current infection. The detailed search strategy is shown in
eTable 1 in the Supplement.
Two authors (R.T. and S.K.) independently reviewed the
titles and abstracts of the identified studies, and those that did
not answer the research question of interest were excluded.
Key Points
Question Does concomitant use of gastric acid suppressant
medications (proton pump inhibitors and histamine H2 receptor
blockers) increase the risk of recurrent Clostridium difficile
infection?
Findings In this meta-analysis of 16 studies comprising 7703
patients, the use of gastric acid suppressants was associated with
a significantly increased risk of recurrent C difficile infection.
Subgroup analyses of studies with potential confounders also
confirmed an increased risk of recurrent C difficile infection with
use of these medications.
Meaning It may be reasonable to stop gastric acid suppressants in
patients with C difficile infection; limiting unnecessary use of these
medications may help to decrease both recurrent C difficile
infection and health care costs.

 The full texts of the remaining articles were reviewed to de-
termine whether the inclusion criteria were fulfilled. The ref-
erence lists of articles with information on the topic were re-
viewed for additional pertinent studies. We manually searched
the abstracts from major gastroenterology and infectious dis-
eases conferences from 2001 to 2015. A flow diagram of in-
cluded studies is shown in Figure 1.
A modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the
methodologic quality of case-control and cohort studies by 2
of us (R.T. and S.K.).23 In this scale, case-control studies were
scored across 3 categories using the following factors: selec-
tion (4 questions), comparability (2 questions), and ascertain-
ment of the outcome of interest (4 questions), and cohort stud-
ies were scored with selection (4 questions), comparability
(2 questions), and ascertainment of the outcome of interest
(5 questions). For each question, 1 point was given if the study
met the criterion except for comparability of study groups, in
which 2 points were awarded for question 2 (the study con-
trolled for age, sex, or both and other confounding factors)
(eTable 2 in the Supplement). Studies with a cumulative score
of 7 or more were considered high quality. Any discrepancies
were addressed by a joint re-evaluation of the original article.
Data Abstraction
Data were independently abstracted to a predetermined col-
lection form by 2 of us (R.T. and S.K.). Data were collected for
each study, including study setting and design, year of publi-
cation,location,primaryoutcomereported,typeofgastricacid
suppressant, number of patients in each group (exposed vs not
exposed and recurrent vs no recurrent CDI). Conflicts in data
abstraction were resolved by consensus.
Outcomes Assessed
Our primary analysis focused on assessing the risk of recur-
rent infection in patients with CDI and its association with gas-
tricacidsuppressantuse.Intheincludedstudies,recurrentCDI
wasdefinedasrecurrentinfectionwithin30,56,60,or90days
after symptom resolution.
Statistical Analysis
We used the random-effects model described by DerSimonian
and Laird24 to calculate meta-analytic ORs and 95% CIs. We as-
sessed heterogeneity within groups with the I2 statistic, which
estimates the proportion of total variation across studies that
is due to heterogeneity in study patients, design, or interven-
tionsratherthanchance;I2valuesgreaterthan50%suggestsub-
stantialheterogeneity.25Weexploredpotentialcausesofhetero-
geneitywithstratificationbyclinicalandmethodologicfeatures
of studies. This stratification included case definition (time in-
terval of recurrence: within 60 days vs within 90 days), type of
gastric acid suppressant (PPI and H2B reported together, PPI
alone, or H2B alone), and study design. The presence of publi-
cation bias was assessed by visual inspection of funnel plots.25
All P values were 2-tailed. For all tests (except heterogeneity),
a probability level <.05 was considered statistically signifi-
cant. Calculations were performed and graphs were con-
structed using RevMan, version 5.3 (Review Manager; Coch-
rane Inc). MetaXL, version 5.1 (EpiGear International Pty Ltd)
was used to calculate the pooled effect size of studies that
reported ORs and 95% CIs on multivariate analysis.26
A priori–defined sensitivity analyses included studies
that had controlled for potential confounders, case-control vs
cohort studies, PPIs vs PPIs and H2Bs, and definition of recur-
rent CDI. Additional sensitivity analyses based on study
setting and diagnostic testing for CDI were performed.
Results
Search Results
The described search strategy revealed 483 potentially rel-
evant studies; abstracts were screened and relevant full-text
articleswereobtained(Figure1).Inall,36full-textarticleswere
reviewed, 20 of which were excluded for various reasons. A
total of 16 studies were included in this meta-analysis: 15 ob-
servational studies and 1 post hoc analysis of 2 clinical trials
of treatment of CDI that evaluated use of gastric acid
suppressants.16-18,27-39 The post hoc analysis of clinical trials
was considered a prospective cohort study because the pri-
mary aim of the trial was to assess response to CDI treat-
ments, and the risk of recurrent CDI from use of gastric acid
suppressantswasasecondaryanalysis.39Together,the16stud-
ies reported 7703 patients with CDI; 1525 (19.8%) of these
patients developed recurrent CDI.
Quality of Included Studies
The median Newcastle-Ottawa quality score for case-control
studies was 6 of 11 possible points (range, 6-8) and for cohort
studies was 10 of 12 possible points (range, 8-10). The Table
depicts the methodologic quality of all included studies.
Characteristics of Included Studies
The characteristics of the 16 included studies are described in
the Table. The studies were performed in North America, Eu-
rope, Korea, Japan, and Israel. The study time periods range
from 1991 to 2013. Most observational studies assessed medi-
cation exposure through a review of medical records.

 Gastric Acid Suppression and CDI Recurrence
Of the 7703 patients with CDI, 4038 (52.4%) were using gas-
tric acid suppressants. The rate of recurrent CDI in patients re-
ceiving these drugs was 22.1% (892 of 4038) compared with
17.3% (633 of 3665) in patients without use of gastric acid sup-
pressants. Meta-analysis of all studies using the random-
effects model demonstrated an increased risk of recurrent CDI
in patients receiving gastric acid suppressants (OR, 1.52; 95%
CI, 1.20-1.94; P < .001) (Figure 2). There was significant hetero-
geneity among the studies, with an I2 value of 64%. No pub-
lication bias was seen (Figure 3).
Subgroup Analyses
Given the significant heterogeneity in the meta-analysis of all
the included studies, we performed subgroup analyses to bet-
ter understand the heterogeneity. However, no single source
of heterogeneity was identified; the I2 value remained in-
creased in all subgroup analyses.
Control for Potential Confounders
Of 16 studies, 9 studies had performed multivariable analysis
after adjusting for potential confounders, including age and
other comorbid conditions (eTable 3 in the Supplement). We
calculated the pooled effect size of these studies by combin-
ing reported ORs and 95% CIs. Meta-analysis of these studies
revealed an increased risk of CDI with use of gastric acid sup-
pressants (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.08-1.76; P = .02) (Figure 4).
Recurrent CDI Definition
On the basis of expert opinion, CDI is considered recurrent if
symptoms recur within 56 days of the initial episode and are
associated with a positive stool C difficile test.40 Since a pos-
sible source of heterogeneity is variability in the definition of
recurrent CDI, we separated studies that defined recurrent CDI
as being within 60 days or 90 days of the initial episode. One
study did not mention the follow-up period and was excluded
from this subgroup analysis. These analyses revealed an in-
creased risk of recurrent CDI for patients using gastric acid sup-
pressantsinstudiesthatdefinedrecurrencewithin90days(OR,
1.53; 95% CI, 1.07-2.19; P = .02) (eFigure 1A in the Supplement)
andinstudiesthatdefinedrecurrencewithin60days(OR,1.54;
95% CI, 1.04-2.28; P = .03) (eFigure 1B in the Supplement).
PPIs vs H2Bs
Several studies included patients using only PPIs, and others
included both PPIs and H2Bs. We separated the studies with
PPIs only or with PPIs and/or H2Bs (reported together). Meta-
analyses revealed an increased risk of CDI recurrence with PPIs
(OR,1.66;95%CI,1.18-2.34;P = .004)(eFigure2AintheSupple-
ment)butnotinstudiesthatmentioneduseofbothPPIsand/or

 H2Bs (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.95-1.99; P = .09) (eFigure 2B in the
Supplement). Only 1 study reported H2B use alone.
Study Design
A subgroup analysis based on the study design—separating
cohort and case-control studies—revealed an increased risk
of recurrent CDI for patients using gastric acid suppressants
in both the case-control studies (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.20-3.03;
P = .006) (eFigure 3A in the Supplement) and cohort studies
(OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.01-1.78; P = .04) (eFigure 3B in the
Supplement).
Study Setting
Of the 16 studies, 9 included patients only from the inpatient
setting, and 7 included both inpatients and outpatients. Sub-
group analysis of the studies with patients from the inpatient
setting only also revealed an increased risk of recurrent CDI
with use of gastric acid suppressants (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.05-
1.97; P = .02) (eFigure 4 in the Supplement).
CDI Diagnostic Assay
Subgroup analysis on the basis of the diagnostic assay used for
CDI—polymerase chain reaction (PCR) vs enzyme-linked im-
munosorbent assay (ELISA)—revealed an increased risk of re-
current CDI among studies that used ELISA to detect recur-
rent CDI (OR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.76-3.67; P < .001) but not among
the studies that used PCR to detect CDI (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.82-
1.80; P = .33) (eFigure 5 in the Supplement).

 neityamongthestudies,mostlikelyowingtothediversepatient
populationsincludedandmethodologicdifferencesbetweenthe
studies. Subgroup analyses separating case-control and cohort
studies and the type of gastric acid suppressant used (PPIs and
H2Bs vs PPIs) did not identify a cause of the heterogeneity.
The pathophysiology of recurrent CDI involves a complex
interplay between host and microbial factors. Established risk
estimatorsofrecurrentCDIincludeadvancedage,priorCDIepi-
sodes,systemicantibioticre-exposure(withdifferentclassesof
antibiotics being associated with different levels of risk of re-
currence),andlowanti-toxin–Aimmunoglobulinlevels.41,42An-
tibiotic therapy for CDI is inactive against C difficile spores and
may also lead to increased disruption of the gut microbiota,
which further contributes to recurrent CDI. It is postulated that
C difficile spores are resistant to degradation in the acid envi-
ronment of the stomach and that gastric acid suppression may
notbeassociatedwithCDI,43althoughingestedvegetativeforms
would be sensitive to stomach acid. Gastric acid suppressants
alterthedistalgutmicrobiome,whichleadstoasubstantialde-
crease in bacterial diversity and may contribute to both pri-
mary and recurrent CDI.44,45 However, this association needs
to be further explored in the setting of robust clinical data that
allow controlling for confounders.
Subgroup analysis of studies that had performed multi-
variateanalysisrevealedanincreasedriskofrecurrentCDIwith
gastric acid suppression after controlling for potential con-
founders.Itispossiblethatuseofgastricacidsuppressantsmay
be greater among the elderly, patients using concomitant an-
tibiotics, and those with comorbid conditions. All of these are
independent risk factors for recurrent CDI and, hence, poten-
tial confounders. Our meta-analysis showed that, even after
controlling for important confounders, gastric acid suppres-
sants emerge as an independent risk factor for recurrent CDI.
This finding indicates that the association between PPIs and
recurrent CDI might be a true association.
Subgroup analysis on the basis of the definition of recur-
rent CDI (time of recurrence from initial episode of 90 days vs
60 days) demonstrated that studies defining CDI recurrence
either way found an increased risk of recurrent CDI with gas-
tric acid suppression. Standard treatment guidelines based on
expert opinion recommend that recurrent CDI be defined as
occurring within 8 weeks of an initial episode and CDI epi-
sodes after 8 weeks be classified as reinfection. It may be pos-
tulated that, after treatment of the initial infection, gastric acid
suppression may also have a role in reinfection.
Subgroup analysis was performed separating case-control
and cohort studies (based on different risks of bias); the risk of
recurrent CDI was increased with gastric acid suppression in
both types of studies. Our subgroup analysis based on the type
of gastric acid suppressant showed an increased risk of recur-
rent CDI with PPIs but not with H2Bs and/or PPIs. Proton pump
inhibitors have a greater gastric acid suppressive effect, so they
may have a larger effect on the microbiome than do H2Bs.44,45
It is also plausible that concomitant use of PPIs and antibiotics
might have an additive effect on CDI recurrence rate, but data
were not available on antibiotic use in individual studies. Most
of the included studies did not mention the dosage and dura-
tion of gastric acid suppressive therapy, so we were unable to
analyzethepossibleeffectsofthesefactors.Ofallincludedstud-
ies, 3 mentioned that gastric acid suppressants were used
continuously,17,27,28 but similar information was not included
in the other studies, which limits our ability to analyze the ef-
fectofcontinuousvsintermittentuseofthesemedications.Dif-
ferences in drug dosage and duration may explain some of the
heterogeneity observed in the analysis.
An analysis of studies that included only inpatients also
revealed increased risk of recurrent CDI with gastric acid sup-
pressants. A higher risk of recurrent CDI was seen among stud-
iesthatusedELISAtodetectrecurrentCDIbutnotamongthose
that used PCR. This difference could be due to an oversensi-
tivity of the PCR test.
The strengths of our study include a comprehensive lit-
erature review with a large patient population compared with
previous meta-analyses, which excluded several key studies.
Our results were stable on all subgroup analyses.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. The individual studies in-
cluded in the meta-analysis varied in several ways, including
design, patient population, definition of recurrent CDI, tests

 primary infection, re-exposure to antibiotics, and duration of
use of gastric acid suppressants. These different aspects led
to substantial heterogeneity. Because the individual studies
controlled for different confounding factors, we were unable
to perform analyses in which all confounding factors could be
accounted or controlled for, including demographics (age and
sex), the number of prior CDI episodes, continuous vs inter-
mittent use of gastric acid suppressants, duration and dose of
the medications, first recurrence vs multiple recurrences, ad-
herence to infection control practices, and the possibility that
positive stool assays represented colonization rather than
active infection.
Conclusions
Gastric acid suppressants may be associated with an in-
creased risk of recurrent CDI. Development of CDI might re-
quire discontinuation of these medications. Unnecessary use
of gastric acid suppressants in both the inpatient and outpa-
tient settings without proper indication should be limited. De-
creasingunnecessaryuseofgastricacidsuppressantsmayhelp
to reduce the rates of primary and recurrent CDI as well as
health care costs. These data should be interpreted with cau-
tion because they may be confounded due to the observa-
tional design of the individual studies. Large, better-
designed prospective studies controlling for confounding
variables are required to understand the association between
gastric acid suppression and recurrent CDI. These studies
should focus on evaluating the effect of concomitant use of an-
tibiotics with PPIs, dosage and duration of gastric acid sup-
pressants, and CDI recurrence. A randomized clinical trial
evaluating the effect of continuing the use of gastric acid sup-
pressants vs stopping them in patients with no serious indi-
cation might be helpful in assessing the true association be-
tween gastric acid suppressants and the risk of recurrent CDI.

Withholding Proton Pump Inhibitors to Prevent Recurrent
Clostridium difficile
Time for a Randomized Trial
Scott R. Bauer, MD, ScM; Patrick O’
Malley, MD, MPH
Clostridium difficile causes almost half a million infections an-
nuallyamonghospitalizedandcommunity-dwellingpatientsin
theUnitedStates,andapproximately1in5patientswilldevelop
arecurrentCdifficileinfection.1Therefore,identificationofmodi-
fiable risk factors for incident
and recurrent C difficile infec-
tion is a public health priority.
In this issue of JAMA Internal
Medicine,Tariqetal2conductedahigh-qualitymeta-analysisof
16observationalstudiesexaminingtheassociationbetweengas-
tricacidsuppressants,suchasproton-pumpinhibitors(PPIs)or
histamine H2-receptor blockers (H2Bs), and recurrent C difficile
infection. They observed a 50% increase in odds of recurrent
C difficile infection among patients receiving PPIs or H2Bs com-
pared with patients not taking gastric acid suppressants.
Because patients who take gastric acid suppressants are
different from, and most likely sicker than, those who do
not take gastric acid suppressants (eg, higher rates of diabe-
tes, peptic ulcer disease, and antibiotic use; longer hospital-
izations; and more intensive care unit days), it is reassuring
that the observed association was relatively robust when
restricted to cohort studies and studies that adjusted for
confounders. However, an unbiased assessment without the
risk of unmeasured confounding would require randomized
clinical trials of gastric acid suppressant continuation vs
withdrawal among patients with C difficile colitis who are
also using chronic gastric acid suppressants. In the mean-
time, these findings support a strategy of withholding gas-
tric acid suppression therapy in the setting of active or
recent C difficile infection.
