Abstract
Background: The Daily Mile is a physical activity programme made popular by a school in Stirling, Scotland. It is
promoted by the Scottish Government and is growing in popularity nationally and internationally. The aim is that
each day, during class time, pupils run or walk outside for 15 min (~1 mile) at a self-selected pace. It is anecdotally
reported to have a number of physiological benefits including increased physical activity, reduced sedentary behaviour,
increased fitness and improved body composition. This study aimed to investigate these reports.
Methods: We conducted a quasi-experimental repeated measures pilot study in two primary schools in the
Stirling Council area: one school with, and one without, intention to introduce the Daily Mile. Pupils at the
control school followed their usual curriculum. Of the 504 children attending the schools, 391 children in
primary classes 1–7 (age 4–12 years) at the baseline assessment took part. The follow-up assessment was in
the same academic year. Outcomes were accelerometer-assessed average daily moderate to vigorous intensity physical
activity (MVPA) and average daily sedentary behaviour, 20-m shuttle run fitness test performance and adiposity assessed
by the sum of skinfolds at four sites. Valid data at both time points were collected for 118, 118, 357 and 327 children,
respectively, for each outcome.
Results: After correction for age and gender, significant improvements were observed in the intervention school relative
to the control school for MVPA, sedentary time, fitness and body composition. For MVPA, a relative increase of 9.1 min
per day (95% confidence interval or 95%CI 5.1–13.2 min, standardised mean difference SMD = 0.407, p = 0.027) was
observed. For sedentary time, there was a relative decrease of 18.2 min per day (10.7–25.7 min, SMD = 0.437, p = 0.017).
For the shuttle run, there was a relative increase of 39.1 m (21.9–56.3, SMD = 0.236, p = 0.037). For the skinfolds, there was
a relative decrease of 1.4 mm (0.8–2.0 mm, SMD = 0.246, p = 0.036). Similar results were obtained when a correction for
socioeconomic groupings was included.
Conclusions: The findings show that in primary school children, the Daily Mile intervention is effective at increasing levels
of MVPA, reducing sedentary time, increasing physical fitness and improving body composition. These findings
have relevance for teachers, policymakers, public health practitioners, and health researchers.

 Background
The Daily Mile is a physical activity intervention devel-
oped at St Ninian’s Primary School (Stirling, Scotland)
in 2012 [1]. The initial aim was to improve the fitness of
children; although, there have since been many additional
benefits anecdotally reported by children, teachers and
parents [1]. These include improved physical activity, sed-
entary time, physical fitness, body composition, sleep, diet,
concentration, well-being and obesity levels. However, no
objectively measured scientific evidence has yet been gath-
ered on the validity of these reports.
The successful implementation of the Daily Mile at
many schools, its continued maintenance and its increasing
popularity seem to be a result of the simplicity of the activ-
ity, the autonomy given to classroom teachers over when
they do it during the school day and the pupil-determined
pace. Since its development, the Daily Mile has been rolled
out across the country by the Scottish government [2]. It is
estimated by Education Scotland that, from local authorities
who responded to their query, ~ 50% of primary schools in
Scotland are already doing the Daily Mile with a further
18% planning to do the Daily Mile soon (personal commu-
nication). It has also become popular in the rest of the UK
with interest from the UK government [3, 4]. Additionally,
it has been introduced in the Netherlands, Belgium and
parts of the USA with interest from many other countries
[5], despite the lack of rigorous evidence on the efficacy of
taking part.
Globally, physical activity levels are low [6]. Further-
more, low physical activity levels in childhood are pre-
dictive of low physical activity levels in adulthood [7].
The World Health Organisation (WHO) considers pol-
icies and interventions to increase physical activity levels
to be important in all age groups and that any potential
harm of increasing physical activity is outweighed by the
associated benefits [8, 9]. In a recent accelerometer study
on children (2–11 years old) from eight European coun-
tries, the proportion of children achieving 60+ minutes
per day (recommended for 5–18 year olds [10]) of moder-
ate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) ranged from 9.
5% to 34.1% in boys and from 2.0% to 14.7% in girls [11].
MVPA levels generally decline with age in both genders as
sedentary time increases [12]. MVPA levels are also be-
lieved to be influenced by socioeconomic status; however,
systematic reviews are unclear on the consistency of this
relationship and more evidence needs to be gathered [13].
School-based physical activity interventions like the Daily
Mile are appealing because they include whole classes,
therefore they reach many children regardless of socioeco-
nomic status, physical activity level or fitness level. They
also break up sedentary time as they occur during lessons
and have the potential to reach much larger proportions
of the population than opt-in groups like sports clubs.
Therefore, understanding the impact of the Daily Mile on
physical activity and sedentary behaviour levels is of key
importance.
Overweight and obesity rates are of pandemic propor-
tions and considered to be a key target for the WHO [8].
In Scotland, 30% of children (29% of boys and 32% of
girls) aged 7–11 years were overweight or obese in 2015
[14], a figure similar to that in England [15]. At the same
time, there is evidence of a decline in the performance of
children in the 20-m shuttle run (an indicator of physical
endurance fitness) [16]. Low fitness and low levels of
physical activity in adults and children are associated with
a number of risk factors for non-communicable diseases
and adverse health outcomes including obesity, cardiovas-
cular disease, diabetes, some cancers, low mood and poor
cognitive function [17–21]. Additionally, both overweight
and low fitness are also known to be related to lower
socioeconomic status [22, 23]. Studies into the impact of
the Daily Mile on fitness and body composition are im-
portant for understanding its potential to improve public
health, including health inequalities, and for developing
future public health policies.
The Daily Mile at least has the potential to impact on
key areas of global public health. Whilst published evidence
shows a positive health relationship between physical
activity, particularly MVPA, and these outcomes [24], it
is unknown whether 15 min of exercise, particularly
with no expectation of intensity, will provide such ben-
efits. Given the associated loss of academic classroom
time (up to 75 min per week), it is paramount that evi-
dence on the impact of the Daily Mile on each anecdotally
reported benefit is gathered to ensure that government
policies are appropriate. Furthermore, any associated ben-
efits in physiological health are likely to be small [25];
thus, it is essential to use gold standard measurement
techniques. Therefore, the aims of this study are to assess
the anecdotally reported physiological benefits of partici-
pation in the Daily Mile. Specifically, using a repeated
measures design and gold standard measurement tech-
niques, we will assess whether the introduction of the
Daily Mile into a primary school setting leads to increased
MVPA, reduced sedentary time, improved fitness and im-
proved body composition.
Methods
Study design and ethics
“Using the Daily Mile to turn the WHEEL” (Well-being,
Health, Exercise, Enjoyment and Learning) is a school-
based quasi-experimental study designed to assess the
anecdotally reported benefits of taking part in the Daily
Mile. Ethical approval was obtained from the University
of Stirling, School of Sport Research Ethics Committee
(reference number 760). Approval was also obtained from
the Director of Children, Young People and Education at
Stirling Council.

 Eligibility and recruitment
State primary schools in the Stirling Council areas were
eligible for inclusion. Recruiting from only one council
area reduced any potential variance in the delivery of edu-
cation that may have impacted on outcome measure-
ments. Two local primary schools were identified and
approached: one that was not doing the Daily Mile but
was intending to introduce it (the intervention school)
and one that was not doing the Daily Mile and did not in-
tend to introduce it (the control school). Both schools had
expressed a desire to introduce the Daily Mile although
the control school felt that it would not be possible due to
the layout of its playground. Both schools had a range of
levels of deprivation, although the majority of pupils were
from higher socioeconomic quintiles (Fig. 1). Participants
were children in all years (age 4–12 years) at the time of
recruitment.
Once the schools had agreed to participate in the study,
parents and guardians of the children were sent a letter and
information sheet about the study with an opt-in consent
form. For children in primary classes 4–7 (age 7–12 years),
an additional child consent form was included. Information
sessions were held in both schools to allow parents to ask
questions and see the study equipment. They were also
given the opportunity to contact the research team by email
or phone to discuss the study. Information about being able
to withdraw from the study at any stage was given in the
information sheet, consent form and verbally. All of the
children were also asked to confirm verbally that they were
happy to take part on each day of testing.

 Intervention
The Daily Mile is a school-based physical activity inter-
vention made popular by a primary school in the Stirling
Council area, Scotland [1]. It involves children going out-
side, at a time of the classroom teacher’s choosing, for ~
15 min of exercise at a pace self-selected by each individual
child. This is done during normal classroom time and is in
addition to time spent in physical education or scheduled
breaks. Typically, it involves laps of a football pitch or play-
ground area. Children often talk as they go and perform a
mixture of walking and running. Those who run the whole
time will complete ~1 mile in 15 min. Children wear their
normal school clothes; most wear their normal school
shoes and jackets are only worn in cold or wet weather. It
is completed on most days regardless of weather condi-
tions. A leaflet produced by the originator school was given
to the school implementing the Daily Mile. No additional
instructions for initiation of the Daily Mile were given by
the research team.
Participant involvement
The outcome measures selected for the study were chosen
based on anecdotal reports of the influence of taking part
in the Daily Mile. This information had been gathered
from the children, their parents and their teachers by the
originator school. The research question, study design and
specific outcome measures were developed in part during
meetings with the head teacher at the originator school,
who was familiar with this information. After publication,
the results from this study will be disseminated to the
schools involved as copies of the manuscript and info-
graphics, and during question and answer sessions in the
schools.
Outcome measures
The primary physiology-related outcome measurements
for the WHEEL project were accelerometer-assessed
MVPA and sedentary time, fitness assessed using a 20-m
shuttle run, and body composition assessed using skinfolds.
Additional, cognitive- and well-being-related outcome mea-
surements will be reported elsewhere.
Participant assessments
Baseline assessments (before the intervention) were car-
ried out in October 2015 for the intervention school and
March 2016 for the control school. Outcome assess-
ments were completed in May 2016 for the intervention
school and June 2016 for the control school. Identical
protocols and procedures were used at both assessments.
They were undertaken by trained fieldworkers. The field-
workers worked in groups such that at least one member of
each group was disclosure-checked under the Protecting
Vulnerable Groups scheme [26]. Children completed tasks
in a random order and were given stickers for completing
each measurement type. Testing sessions lasted between 1
and 2 h and were carried out over 2 weeks, depending on
class size and school timetable.
ActiGraph accelerometers were used to assess physical
activity and sedentary time. Five models of accelerometer
were used: ActiGraph wGT3X-BT, wGT3X+, GT3X+,
GT3X and GT1M. The GT1M and GT3X monitors are
comparable when classifying total time spent in specific
intensity categories [27]. There is also strong agreement
between the GT1M, GT3X and GT3X+ accelerometers,
making it acceptable to use them in the same study [28].
The primary difference between the wGT3X-BT and
GT3X+ accelerometers is the ability of the wGT3X-BT to
communicate wirelessly and all measurements should
function identically (personal communication from Acti-
Graph). Accelerometers were worn around the waist on
the left side with the same orientation to standardise the
position. Children were asked to wear the belt for eight
consecutive days during waking hours (except when bath-
ing or swimming). A poster and instruction sheet with
visual and written prompts were provided to each child to
remind them of how and when to wear the accelerometer.
Upon collection by the research team, the data were
downloaded with the ActiLife 6 software (ActiGraph LLC,
USA). A valid measurement required at least 10 h wear
for 3 days [29]. A 60-s epoch was used and non-wear time
was defined as strings of consecutive zeros lasting 60 min
or more [30]. The accelerometer output is in counts per
minute (cpm). Evenson cut points [31] were used to define
time spent being sedentary (≤100 cpm) and time spent in
MVPA (≥2296 cpm). The accelerometer data were cor-
rected for wear time in addition to gender and age in days
on the day of testing in the main analysis.
The maximal multistage 20-m shuttle run test [32] was
assessed using the Multistage Fitness Test CD (Sports Coach
UK, UK) using the standard procedure. Cones marked shut-
tle boundaries and lanes. Between four (younger) and eight
(older) children completed the test at the same time depend-
ing on their age group. Instructions and a demonstration of
the test were provided prior to each group participating and
additional verbal instructions were provided during the test
as necessary. The test began at 8.5 km·h− 1 and after each
minute increased by 0.5 km·h− 1. When a child was unable
to reach the 20-m line prior to the bleep twice in a row, they
were asked to stop and their level and shuttle score was
recorded. Shuttle run tests were performed outside on tar-
mac. Age-corrected _
VO2 max scores were created according
to the method of [32] for comparison with other studies
(Additional file 1: Tables S1–S3). However, this corrects for
age in years and therefore, it was not used for the main ana-
lysis. Instead, shuttle distance corrected for gender and age
in days on day of testing was used to give an improved reso-
lution to the correction in the main analysis.

 All skinfold measurements were completed with the
child behind a privacy screen with at least two disclosure-
checked fieldworkers present. Fieldworkers taking skinfold
measurements were trained by an International Society
for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK) Level 3
instructor prior to involvement in the study and all
measurements were taken according to standard ISAK
procedures [33]. Triceps, biceps, iliac crest and subscapu-
lar skinfolds were measured using Harpenden skinfold cal-
lipers (Baty International, UK). All measurements were
taken from the right-hand side with the child standing.
Where appropriate, they stood on an anthropometric box.
Skinfold measurements were summed prior to analysis to
give a sum of skinfolds (in millimetres). Skinfold data were
corrected for gender and age in days on day of testing in
the main analysis.
Height was measured, to the nearest 1 mm, without
shoes using the Leicester Height Measure (Seca, UK) ac-
cording to standard ISAK procedures [33]. Body weight
was measured without shoes in light clothing to the nearest
0.1 kg using electronic Sensa 804 scales (Seca, UK). Height
(m) and weight (kg) were used to calculate the body mass
index (BMI = weight/height2). BMI z scores relative for age
were calculated using UK 1990 reference data in the LMS
Growth add-in for Microsoft Excel [34]. Healthy weight
was defined as BMI z score < 1.04, overweight as BMI z
score of 1.04–1.63 and obesity as BMI z score ≥ 1.64.
All anthropometric measurements were taken twice
and the average taken for the analyses. Where there was
a substantial difference between the two measurements,
a third measurement was taken and the median value
was used for the analyses.
Additional Information
Schools provided the date of birth and postcodes for all
consented pupils. The date of birth allowed the analyses
to be corrected for age on day of testing. The postcode
allowed the assignment of the Scottish Index of Multiple
Deprivation (SIMD) [35]. SIMD combines data from seven
different domains of deprivation into a single score: income,
employment, health, education, access to services, crime
and housing. However, it should be noted that this gives
a postcode-specific deprivation score that may not re-
flect that of an individual household.
Statistical analyses
Descriptive statistics, Pearson χ2 and odds ratios were
calculated in Excel 2013. Baseline group frequency
comparisons were performed using a Pearson χ2 test.
Baseline group mean comparisons were performed using
Student’s t test (uncorrected) or general linear model
ANOVA (corrected for age at time of testing, gender and
age*gender). The main analyses were performed in SPSS
Statistics (version 21.0.0.1). General linear model regression
analyses with repeated measures were used to investigate
the effect of doing the Daily Mile. Analyses of all outcome
measures included an adjustment for the common
confounders: age at time of testing, gender and age*gender.
This controls for the effects of age and gender and any
different effects of age in the two genders as well as any
differences in length of time in the study. Analyses for
MVPA and sedentary time were additionally corrected for
accelerometer wear time as a covariate. Analyses were
conducted first without and then with a correction for
SIMD. Standardised mean differences (SMDs), or effect
sizes, are calculated as a change measured in the
intervention school relative to the control school as a
proportion of the pooled standard deviation of the
change. An SMD of 0.2–0.5 is considered to be small,
an SMD of 0.5–0.8 is considered to be medium and an
SMD of 0.8 or above is considered to be large [36]. No
correction for multiple testing was made since all four
primary outcome measures were anecdotally reported
to be influenced by the Daily Mile.
Results
Figure 1 shows the study profile. Overall 77.6% of eli-
gible pupils consented to the study (77.3% in the inter-
vention school and 78.1% in the control school). A total
of 371 pupils (247 and 124 in the intervention and con-
trol schools respectively) provided at least one measure-
ment in both rounds of testing. All consented children,
irrespective of whether they had all measurements or
not, are included in Fig. 1. For each outcome measure-
ment, the information in Tables 1 and 2 is based only on
children who had measurements at both time points.
Consent for a complete set of measurements was given
in the majority of cases; although, on the day of testing,
some pupils did not wish to give verbal consent for skinfold
measurements, had worn inappropriate clothing for some
skinfold measurements or were unable to complete individ-
ual tests due to pre-existing minor injuries or ailments. In
total, at both baseline and follow-up, between 84% and 94%
of originally consented participants had data on fitness and
body composition outcomes and the proportions were
similar at both baseline and follow-up, in the intervention
and control schools and in males and females (Fig. 1).
Three pupils refused to wear accelerometers. The pro-
portion of pupils with valid accelerometer data was lower
than other measurements although the proportion of
males and females was similar. Only 32% of participants
in the intervention school and 67% in the control school
had valid accelerometer data at baseline whilst at follow-
up 65% and 64% respectively had valid accelerometer data
(Fig. 1). This was partially because of the requirement that
wearers had at least 10 hours of valid wear time on at least
3 days [31]. However, due to a desire to start doing the
Daily Mile as soon as possible in the intervention school
Chesham et al. BMC Medicine  (2018) 16:64 
Page 5 of 13
 and a limited number of accelerometers (117), it was pos-
sible to collect true baseline data (i.e. prior to beginning
the Daily Mile) from only a portion of the intervention
school participants. These participants were selected at
random based on the availability of pupils for the other
physiological tests.
The baseline characteristics of the participants are given
in Table 1. Age was significantly higher in the control
school at baseline due to the difference in the time of base-
line measurements meaning that the pupils were slightly
further through the academic year at the control school
(Table 1). The percentage meeting the physical activity
guidelines of 60+ min MVPA per day and the sum of skin-
folds were both higher in the control school. However, after
correction for age, gender and age*gender, only sedentary
time differed significantly between the schools at baseline,
suggesting that the correct confounders were accounted for
in the analysis. Additionally, the intra-school differences
between genders and year groups were similar (Additional
file 1: Table S1).
SIMD scores were similar across schools (χ2 = 1.299,
p = 0.254). For quintiles 4–5 (least deprived), the scores
were 71% versus 65%, respectively, for the intervention
school and control school. For quintiles 1–3 (most
deprived), the scores were 29% versus 35%. These reflect
the lower deprivation than the average across Scotland [35],
since ~20% would be expected in each quintile. However,
this excess of children from less deprived areas reduces the
likelihood of observing an impact of the Daily Mile, rather
than creating any potential artefacts, as the children are
more likely to be fitter and less likely to be overweight or
obese [22, 23] at baseline. Nonetheless, children from
areas with lower socioeconomic scores (quintiles 1–3)
had similar minutes of MVPA and sedentary time compared
to those with higher socioeconomic scores (quintiles 4–5).
They were also equally likely to meet the physical activity
guidelines. However, they had lower shuttle distance, and a
higher sum of skinfolds and rates of overweight and obesity
(Table 2). A full breakdown of baseline characteristics
by socioeconomic group, school and gender is given in
Additional file 1: Table S2.
In the main analysis, after adjustment for the common
confounders of age, gender and age*gender, significant
improvements were observed in the intervention school

SMD is calculated as the change in the intervention school relative to the control school as a proportion of the standard deviation of the change. Analyses were
conducted using GLM-ANOVA corrected for age, gender, age*gender ± SIMD with repeated measures for the outcome. Sedentary time and MVPA were also
corrected for accelerometer wear time

 inclusion of SIMD (r = −0.564 and −0.212, respectively)
although a change in MVPA additionally predicted a
change in shuttle distance (r = 0.187, n = 115, p = 0.046).
However, the relationship between a change in sum of
skinfolds and a change in shuttle distance differed by
school (interaction p = 0.043). The relationship was
stronger for the intervention school than the control
school (r = −0.245 and −0.046, respectively). The relationship

 between a change in MVPA and a change in sedentary be-
haviour was not different by school (interaction p = 0.896).
However, it should be noted that the calculations for MVPA
and sedentary time are linked by the finite number of mi-
nutes in a day and a change in one is likely to result in a
change in the other.
Discussion
In this primary-school-based quasi-experimental pilot
study, which investigated the effects of taking part in the
Daily Mile, we found evidence of a positive effect on our
four
primary
outcomes—accelerometer-assessed
time
spent in MVPA, accelerometer-assessed time spent in sed-
entary behaviour, physical fitness and body composition—
after correcting for the common confounders of age and
gender with or without socioeconomic grouping.
Comparisons with other studies
Whilst no other studies have investigated the effect of
taking part in the Daily Mile, some have investigated the
effect of increasing physical activity throughout the school
day or introducing short physical activity breaks into the
school day itself [37, 38]. On the whole, they have had
mixed results, with some finding alterations in MVPA and
others not. This is likely in part due to the different
methods used to assess these behaviours, in part due to
the different interventions involved and in part due to the
different accelerometer cut-points that can be found in
the literature. Additionally, some studies use self-reported
physical activity measures, which although easier to ad-
minister on a large scale, can lead to differing estimates in
comparison to accelerometry [39]. Undoubtedly, the age
and demographic of the children also has an influence
and an intervention that works in one setting may not
work in another.
Similarly, some studies have found changes in body
composition or fitness whilst others have not [40–42].
The observed effect of the Daily Mile on fitness in the
current study may be a result of the type of intervention
activity involved (i.e. running) being similar to the fitness
test. However, few studies have taken detailed physio-
logical measurements and often assess BMI only. Changes
in BMI are observed with some physical activity interven-
tions but mostly in high-BMI groups. The decrease in the
sum of skinfolds observed in this study without a con-
comitant change in BMI z score is likely due to the higher
resolution of skinfolds and its utility in assessing body fat-
ness without the confounding effect of muscle mass.
Meaning of study findings
Scottish government figures suggest that 73% of children
in Scotland (77% of boys and 69% of girls) meet the
physical activity guidelines [14]. However, this figure is
based on self-reported questionnaire results rather than
accelerometer assessment and is likely to contain bias
[43, 44]. Estimates by accelerometer of the percentage of
children meeting the physical activity guidelines vary across
Europe, from as low as 2% to as high as 63% [11, 45]. The
children in this study fall within this range and are likely
typical of Scottish and European primary school children
[46, 47]. Regardless of how many meet the minimum
recommended guidelines (at least 60 min per day), higher
levels of MVPA are generally considered to be better. This
study shows that introducing the Daily Mile into a primary
school setting does increase the MVPA of children by 9.
1 min (SMD = 0.407). Although the Daily Mile is a 15-min
physical activity intervention, an increase of ~9 min is
consistent with the pattern of running interspersed with
periods of walking and chatting that is observed in children
taking part (personal observations). Although the SMD
would be considered to be small according to Cohen [36],
small effects on a prevalent behaviour, such as physical in-
activity, may have a high impact at the level of population
health [48]. In addition, a change of this magnitude is close
to the 10 min increase in MVPA previously associated with
meaningful reductions in cardiometabolic risk in children
and adolescents [49].
Sedentary time is less well studied than physical activ-
ity. Nonetheless, the available evidence suggests that the
children in this study are typical of European children
[11, 45]. In some studies, sedentary time appears to be a
predictor of chronic disease independent of physical activity
levels [50]. Two aspects of sedentary behaviour appear to
be key to this: total sedentary time and prolonged blocks of
sedentary time. The Daily Mile is potentially able to address
both these issues although the present analysis only investi-
gates total sedentary time. Although children at the inter-
vention school were less sedentary at the baseline (after
correction for the common confounders), this would make
it harder to observe a reduction in sedentary behaviour ra-
ther than easier. Despite this, this study shows an ~18 min
reduction (SMD = 0.437) in average daily sedentary time
with the introduction of the Daily Mile. Again, this is con-
sistent with a target of 15 min of physical activity since the
children will at least be up from their chairs for a slightly
longer period. However, if done correctly, the Daily Mile
also breaks up the sedentary time, as it should happen in
the middle of lessons, so that the children are likely to
be sitting before and after their Daily Mile. As for
MVPA, the SMD would be considered to be small but
may well have significant impacts on population health
due to mass participation. Additionally, the data also show
a strong correlation between increasing MVPA and redu-
cing sedentary time. This suggests that children are not
compensating for the increase in MVPA during the Daily
Mile by sitting more at other times of the day: they are re-
placing sedentary time with MVPA. However, note that
the calculations for MVPA and sedentary time are linked

 by the finite number of minutes in a day and may be more
appropriately analysed in future studies using a compos-
itional data analysis.
The children in the IDEFICS study [51] have median
values of age-corrected _
VO2 max scores between 46.7 and
48.1 ml·kg− 1·min− 1 for boys and between 45.4 and 47.4
ml·kg− 1·min− 1 for girls between the ages of 6 and 9 years.
Relatively, the children in the current study could be
considered to have high aerobic fitness (see Additional file 1:
Tables S1 and S2 for age-corrected _
VO2 max scores). This
high baseline fitness would make it less likely that a change
in fitness could be observed after a small increase in physical
activity. Nonetheless, an improvement in fitness, as
measured by shuttle distance (39.1 m, SMD = 0.236),
was observed with the introduction of the Daily Mile. _
V
O2 max is linked with cardiovascular health and all-
cause mortality [52]. Although the SMD would be con-
sidered to be small, it may have a significant impact on
a population scale. The CARDIA study in young adults
suggests that having a
_
VO2 max of 3.5 ml·kg− 1·min− 1
(approximately 1 metabolic equivalent) higher gives a
reduction in all-cause mortality of ~15% [53]. Whilst
we only see a relative increase of ~0.35 ml·kg− 1·min− 1
(Additional file 1: Table S3) with the Daily Mile, this is
still predictive of an ~1.5% reduction in all-cause mortality
risk. Note that the conversion from shuttle distance to _
VO2
max includes age in years and has, therefore, relatively
lower resolution. It has also been suggested that hav-
ing a higher cardiorespiratory fitness at a younger age
confers the greatest survival benefit [52]. Furthermore,
those with lower starting values appear likely to bene-
fit to a greater extent [54]. This suggests that there
are potentially useful health benefits associated with
taking part in the Daily Mile.
The children at both schools in this study had lower
rates of overweight and obesity than are typical of Scottish
children. The Scottish Health Survey reports overweight
and obesity rates in 7–11 year olds as 30% (29% for boys
and 32% for girls) [14]. Again, this makes it less likely that
a change in adiposity could be observed after a small in-
crease in physical activity. Still, a reduction in adiposity as
measured by skinfold (1.4 mm, SMD = 0.246) was ob-
served with the introduction of the Daily Mile. Again, al-
though the SMD would be considered to be small, at the
population level it may have significant impacts on levels
of adiposity. It is also possible that the impact of the Daily
Mile on body composition may be larger still in children
with higher rates of overweight and obesity. This interven-
tion may be a useful component within measures designed
to help tackle the obesity pandemic [8]. The strong correl-
ation between those who reduced their skinfolds the most
and those who gained the most fitness may indicate a
common cause. Given that the pace each child completes
the Daily Mile at is self-determined, it is possible that the
children who gained the most benefits took a particular
approach to the Daily Mile. An insight into this may come
when we interview the children taking part in the Daily
Mile about their experiences.
Evidence linking socioeconomic status to MVPA and
sedentary behaviour is unclear [13]. This is in part due
to the use of different methods of capturing these out-
come measures but also due to different ways of assessing
socioeconomic status in different countries. Nonetheless,
these outcome measures do appear to associate with spe-
cific aspects of socioeconomic status in some studies.
However, clear differences between higher and lower so-
cioeconomic groupings could be seen in the current study
for fitness and body composition: children from postcodes
with higher deprivation had lower levels of fitness, higher
sums of skinfolds and higher rates of overweight and
obesity. This is consistent with the widely recognised
health inequality gap [55]. However, no differences were
seen between the socioeconomic groupings in response to
the introduction of the Daily Mile, suggesting that it may
be beneficial to all groups regardless of background. Note
that this study was not intended to investigate this, and
larger more powerful studies are needed to investigate this
aspect of the Daily Mile. A summary of the study and its
implications can be found in Box 1.
Strengths and limitations of study
This study is the first to investigate the widely publicised
and adopted Daily Mile physical activity intervention.
The intervention appears to be increasingly popular and
has now been maintained in the originator school for more
than five years. Thus, it is undoubtedly feasible to deliver
and has been adopted locally in many areas. What was un-
known was the efficacy for the anecdotally reported physio-
logical benefits of taking part in the Daily Mile. Consent
rates were high (>77% in both schools) as were the number
of children successfully assessed at both time points for
most outcome measures. We assessed MVPA and seden-
tary time using the gold standard accelerometer technique,
we assessed fitness using the bleep test (which has been val-
idated in this age group) and we assessed body composition
using labour-intensive skinfold assessments rather than the
more straightforward but lower resolution BMI.
We acknowledge that there was a difference in seden-
tary time between the schools at baseline and the socio-
economic groupings were not reflective of the whole of
Scotland, which are limitations of our study. However,
these differences would be predicted to make any effects of
the Daily Mile harder to observe, not easier. Changes were
observed despite these differences. It would have been pref-
erable to assess both the intervention and control schools
at the same time of year to avoid any seasonal impact on
physical activity. However, we believe that October and
March should be similar enough to allow comparison [56].
Additionally, it would have been better to have had both
Chesham et al. BMC Medicine  (2018) 16:64 
Page 10 of 13
 schools involved in the study for the same length of time,
although, correcting for age and gender should account for
this difference. It is also possible that differences in the
health and well-being policies within the schools contrib-
uted to differences in the results. However, the schools were
selected to be from the same local authority and to be of
similar socioeconomic make-up to minimise potential dif-
ferences. As predicted, changes in outcome variables had
effect sizes at the smaller end of the distribution (0.2–0.5).
However, given the involvement of whole classes, small ef-
fects could have an important impact on population health.
To gain further confidence in the results, this study should
be replicated in a larger number of schools. Furthermore,
no monitoring of adherence, or level of adherence, to the
intervention was carried out, although the results suggest
adherence was sufficient.
Unanswered questions and future research
Additional anecdotally reported benefits to the Daily
Mile (cognition, behaviour and well-being) are currently
being investigated [57, 58]. It is essential that the current
studies are replicated in a larger number of schools and
countries to ensure that the findings are both robust and
repeatable in different educational contexts. Future stud-
ies should include diet and sleep quality, which we are
not yet investigating, to explore the potential mecha-
nisms of impact. More attention should be given to
when the Daily Mile is being done during the school day
and whether it is breaking up sedentary time. Addition-
ally, future studies should investigate whether MVPA
and sedentary behaviour are changing on weekdays and/
or weekend days.
In 2015, the Scottish government launched the Scottish
Attainment Challenge with the aim of achieving equity in
educational outcomes for all Scottish children [59]. Whilst
the current study found no difference in the response to
the Daily Mile by socioeconomic grouping, both schools
were heavily weighted towards less deprived catchment
areas. Furthermore, the current study was not powered to
detect such a complex interaction. The Daily Mile is a
free, simple intervention that can be rolled out to schools
regardless of socioeconomic status. It is necessary to con-
duct carefully designed studies to understand the impact
of the Daily Mile in different socioeconomic settings and
to understand whether it can have any impact on the at-
tainment gap.
The sample of children participating in this study in-
cluded a number with challenging behaviours including
autism spectrum disorders. Nonetheless, they took part
in the Daily Mile and our investigations. Understanding
the impact of the Daily Mile on children with differing
learning needs should also be a future priority.
This study shows the value of introducing the Daily Mile
into schools. Whilst the Daily Mile has been introduced as
Box 1: What this study adds
Why was this study done?
�
Low physical activity, high sedentary behaviour, declining
fitness levels and high levels of overweight and obesity are
global problems that have been targeted by the World
Health Organisation.
�
The Daily Mile is an increasingly popular school-based physical
activity intervention, backed by the Scottish government, which
is anecdotally reported to lead to increased physical activity,
reduced sedentary time, improved fitness and improved body
composition. Pupils run or walk laps of the playground at a
self-selected pace for 15 min during normal classroom
time. It is increasingly popular throughout the UK, in parts
of Europe and some schools in the USA.
�
However, these reported benefits remain anecdotal and need
to be quantitatively and objectively assessed to ensure that
the loss of academic classroom time is providing the
reported alternative benefits.
What did the researchers do and find?
�
Two schools in the Stirling Council area, Scotland, were
recruited: one with intention to start the Daily Mile, the
other without.
�
Researchers assessed the physical activity and sedentary
behaviour of children using accelerometers, their fitness
using the bleep test and their body composition using
skinfolds. This was done in both schools before and after the
intervention school introduced the Daily Mile.
�
This quasi-experimental pilot study found that, after correcting
for age, gender and socioeconomic grouping, taking part in the
Daily Mile did lead to an improvement in physical activity,
sedentary behaviour, fitness and body composition of children
in the intervention school relative to the control school.
What do these findings mean?
�
This suggests that the Daily Mile is a worthwhile
intervention to introduce in schools and that it should be
considered for inclusion in government policy.
�
This study can underpin the policy already introduced by
the Scottish government and the development of future
policy in other parts of the UK and abroad.

 policy across Scotland, many schools do not have ap-
propriate outdoor facilities to allow their children to
take part. One of the challenges for policymakers and
other stakeholders is to consider how to introduce the
Daily Mile or alternative interventions that have been
shown to increase MVPA and fitness into such schools
or how to adapt those schools to allow the introduction
of appropriate interventions.
Conclusions
In conclusion, introducing the Daily Mile to the primary
school day appears to be an effective intervention for
increasing MVPA and reducing sedentary time and it
has measurable impacts on key aspects of metabolic
health: body composition and physical fitness. This study
provides the first assessment of the Daily Mile and it will
allow the development of evidence-based policy around
introducing the Daily Mile to more schools.
