Abstract
Influenza pandemics can emerge unexpectedly and wreak global devastation. However,
each of the six pandemics since 1889 emerged in the Northern Hemisphere just after the flu
season, suggesting that pandemic timing may be predictable. Using a stochastic model fit to
seasonal flu surveillance data from the United States, we find that seasonal flu leaves a tran-
sient wake of heterosubtypic immunity that impedes the emergence of novel flu viruses.
This refractory period provides a simple explanation for not only the spring-summer timing
of historical pandemics, but also early increases in pandemic severity and multiple waves of
transmission. Thus, pandemic risk may be seasonal and predictable, with the accuracy of
pre-pandemic and real-time risk assessments hinging on reliable seasonal influenza surveil-
lance and precise estimates of the breadth and duration of heterosubtypic immunity.
Author summary
Influenza pandemics emerge via genomic reassortment between circulating human and
animal strains. The risk of pandemic emergence should therefore be high during the flu
season, when viruses are abundant and conditions favor transmission. However, the six
pandemics on record since 1889 all emerged in the Northern Hemisphere following the
flu season, suggesting that other forces may predictably constrain pandemic risk. We find
that seasonal influenza epidemics leave a wake of immunity that impedes pandemic emer-
gence. This transient refractory period is consistent with the spring-summer emergence,
multiple wave dynamics of recent pandemics, and may cause initial underestimation of
the viral transmission rate. These findings may improve pre-pandemic risk assessments
and real-time situational awareness, particularly as we gain greater insight into the extent
of immunity.
Introduction
Influenza pandemics have emerged regularly throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, resulting
in significant morbidity and mortality [1]. In preparation for future pandemics, public health

 agencies have enacted measures to expedite pandemic vaccine development [2]. However, the
manufacturing and distribution process is still expected to take several months, as occurred
following the initial identification of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus [2–6]. In the interim, the
primary pandemic control measures will include prophylaxis and treatment with antiviral
medications and social distancing measures [2, 7, 8]. Given the potential severity of disease
and rapid pace of emergence, advanced warning and early response are imperative. Thus, pub-
lic health agencies have established extensive surveillance networks in humans, livestock, and
wild bird populations [9–11]. While these systems are designed to identify potential pandemic
threats as infections arise, researchers have also conducted mutatagenesis experiments to iden-
tify upstream evolutionary risks, that is, potential pathways toward human infectivity and viru-
lence [12, 13]. However, the utility of such “gain-of-function” experiments has been disputed,
particularly given the risks associated with handling highly virulent influenza viruses [14].
While public health agencies cannot yet anticipate the timing and location of the next pan-
demic, past pandemics may provide insight into spatiotemporal trends in risk. All recent pan-
demics emerged in the Northern Hemisphere in the spring and summer months (Fig 1):
March (1918), April (1957, 2009), May (1889, 1977), and July (1968), though the 1977 pan-
demic virus was highly similar to a previously circulating virus, and thus thought to have
emerged via accidental release from a laboratory [15, 16]. The 1889, 1977 and 1968 pandemics
produced single epidemic waves, while the 1918, 1957, and 2009 pandemics spread in two
waves–a relatively short spring-summer wave followed by a more extensive fall wave [17–26].
These pandemics also varied in severity, as measured by case fatality rates, with 1918 far more
severe than the others [27, 28].
Fig 1. Historical pandemics emerged at the tail-end of flu seasons. Gray curves show the 1997-2015 flu seasons in the US, excluding the 2009
H1N1 pandemic, as estimated by the CDC’s ILINet surveillance system [29]. Vertical dashed lines indicate emergence week of historical pandemics in
their source populations, defined as the first reported outbreak of severe influenza preceding the initial pandemic wave. These estimates were
obtained from: 1889 [17], 1918 [18, 19], 1957 [20, 21], 1968 [22, 23], and 1977 [24]. To be consistent, we date the emergence of the 2009 pandemic
according to the first significant outbreak preceding the initial wave, rather than the earlier outbreaks in rural Mexico that were identified only in
retrospect [30].

Competing interests: The authors have declared
that no competing interests exist.
 The spring and summer emergence of the six recent pandemics seems more than just a
coincidence (Multinomial test; p < 0.05), but the sample is quite small and derived from
imperfect historical data. If, indeed, pandemic risk is seasonal, there are several plausible driv-
ers. Two factors might favor pandemic emergence during the typical flu season. First, the
socio-environmental conditions thought to promote seasonal influenza transmission (e.g.,
humidity and school calendar) might also favor pandemic transmission during the winter
months [31–33]. Second, pandemic emergence is often preceded by viral reassortment in
hosts co-infected by a seasonal influenza virus and a novel virus, which should become more
likely as the prevalence of seasonal flu increases [34–36]. On the other hand, transient cross-
immunity from seasonal influenza infections may impede infection by novel viruses during
the flu season. Together, these counterbalancing factors may produce a tight and predictable
window for pandemic emergence.
Viruses of a common subtype (e.g. H3N2) are known to compete via homosubtypic immu-
nity, producing stereotypical single branch influenza phylogenies [37–41]. However, the extent
and mechanisms of competition among viruses of differing subtypes (e.g. a resident seasonal
virus and a novel pandemic virus) via heterosubtypic immunity are not fully understood [34,
42–48]. A first childhood influenza infection may provide lifelong heterosubtypic immunity
against subtypes within the same phylogenetic group (Group 1 includes H1, H2, and H5;
Group 2 includes H3 and H7) [34, 37, 48–52]. In addition, any childhood or adulthood influ-
enza infection may provide temporary, generalized heterosubtypic protection against other
subtypes, lasting from a week to several months [44, 47, 53–56]. This is perhaps mediated by
cells surviving influenza infection that exhibit an increased antiviral response and naturally
turnover within a short period of time [53]. Immunity may not fully prevent infection, but
individuals infected within this period experience reduced viral shedding, disease severity, and
infection durations, likely reducing subsequent spread of the disease [45, 47, 55, 57].
Heterosubtypic immunity among influenza viruses would naturally lead to competition
between subtypes, with the strength of the competition determined by the magnitude and
duration of the immune response. Even if heterosubtypic immunity were short-lived, seasonal
influenza may temporarily impede the emergence novel influenza subtypes. If a pandemic
virus manages to emerge during this so-called refractory period, it would likely start slow and
accelerate as residual immunity wanes.
Here, we characterize the impact of seasonal influenza on both the likelihood and magni-
tude of pandemic emergence events, mediated by transient heterosubtypic immunity following
infection, and then integrate environmental constraints on flu transmission to estimate the
seasonality of pandemic emergence risk. We fit two mathematical models to historical influ-
enza data–one that assumes a homogeneous population and another that captures realistic het-
erogeneity in contact patterns–and simulate the introduction of novel influenza virus
throughout the influenza season. We focus our analysis on the 2008-2009 seasonal epidemic,
since it directly preceded the 2009 pandemic; for comparison, we also analyzed the larger
2003-2004 season (S4, S5 and S6 Figs). As expected, the risk of pandemic emergence declines
in the wake of seasonal influenza, as does the effective reproduction number (early transmis-
sion rate) of any emerging pandemic. The seasonality of pandemic risk depends critically on
the duration of immunity and the structure of the host population.
Materials and methods
We developed a stochastic two-strain influenza transmission model that incorporates contact
network structure, heterosubtypic immunity, and new estimates of the seasonal flu reproduc-
tion number to investigate the dynamics of pandemic emergence risk. We simulated

 thousands of novel pandemic virus introductions to estimate the changing probability of pan-
demic emergence and the Reff upon emergence, as the flu seasons unfold.
Two-strain influenza transmission model
We included short-term heterosubtypic immunity using a two-strain SEIPR (Susceptible-
Exposed-Infectious-Protected-Recovered) network model similar to [58] (S1 Fig). All individ-
uals are initially susceptible to both seasonal and pandemic influenza. Upon infection with one
strain, individuals progress through the Exposed and Infectious classes; upon recovery, they
enter a short period of complete protection from infection by the other strain, after which they
regain full susceptibility to that strain. Our modeling framework does not allow simultaneous
infection (co-infection) by both subtypes, as co-infection is thought to be relatively infrequent
during concurrent epidemics [59]. Close sequential infections can occur in the model, as some
individuals transition through the protected class almost immediately (S2 Fig). We modeled
single influenza seasons, and thus assumed that recovered individuals are fully and perma-
nently immune to their infecting strain, that there are no births or deaths, and that the network
structure does not change over the course of a single simulation.
Infectious nodes infect susceptible neighbors at a per contact rate of βi, where i 2 {seasonal,
pandemic} indicates strain. We estimate βseasonal by fitting a seasonal transmission model to
recent flu season data (see data and model fitting section), and consider three transmission
rate scenarios for the pandemic virus (1) equal transmissibility (βpandemic = βseasonal), (2) lower
transmissibility (βpandemic < βseasonal), and (3) higher transmissibility (βpandemic > βseasonal).
We assume that durations of the exposed, infectious, and recovered periods are exponen-
tially distributed. Upon infection by either strain, individuals instantaneously enter the
Exposed class, then become infectious stochastically, at rate Z ¼

2:26 days� 1, recover from infec-
tion at rate g ¼

3:38 days� 1, and leave the heterosubtypic immune period at rate a ¼ 1
42 days� 1,
based on published estimates [53, 60]. We considered a range of heterosubtypic immune peri-
ods (S3 Fig), and herein report results based on a 42-day duration.
Adding seasonal forcing.
We implemented seasonal forcing through a traditional humid-
ity-forced influenza model estimating R0 through time (R0(t)) [61]:
R0ðtÞ ¼ expð� 180qðtÞ þ lnðR0max � R0minÞÞ þ R0min
Where q(t) is the specific humidity at time t. We set R0min = 0.8, as it is the lower bound esti-
mate from [61], and solve for R0max through model fitting. We used eq 3 to convert between R0
and β, obtaining β(t) for model fitting and simulation purposes. We used the daily average spe-
cific humidity for the United States from 2000-2016 available from NOAA [62].
Simulation implementation
We simulated two-strain influenza epidemics using a stochastic Gillespie next-reaction algo-
rithm built from EpiFire, a C++ network epidemic simulation library [63, 64]. We generated
random contact networks with specified degree distributions using a configuration model
algorithm [64]. For purposes of comparison, we assume that the homogeneous and empirical
networks share the same mean degree of hki, with all nodes in the homogeneous network hav-
ing degree exactly equal to hki and the degrees in the empirical network randomly assigned
according to an exponential distribution with rate 1
hki. Based on published estimates for a large
urban network, we assume hki = 16 [65].
For each scenario—combination of contact network, pandemic introduction time,
βpandemic, and immune period α—we ran 5,000 simulations. Each was seeded by infecting five

 randomly chosen individuals with the seasonal virus; at the designated introduction time, a
single randomly chosen susceptible individual was infected by the pandemic virus. We termi-
nated the simulations once no individuals remained Exposed or Infectious. For each simula-
tion we tracked the number of nodes in each class (S1 Fig) and the average excess degree in the
susceptible portion of the network, which is defined as follows. Consider only nodes currently
susceptible to pandemic infection; call edges connecting such nodes susceptible edges and the
number of such edges emanating from a susceptible node, the susceptible degree of that node.
Imagine choosing a random susceptible edge and following it to one of its nodes. The average
excess degree is the expected number of susceptible edges emanating from that susceptible
node (other than the one along which we arrived), and is given by

, where
hksusceptiblei and hk2
susceptiblei are the average susceptible degree and average squared susceptible
degree in the network. Simulation source code can be accessed at https://github.com/sjfox/

Data and model fitting
To estimate the seasonal flu transmission rate, we fit a simple deterministic, network-based,
ordinary differential equation (ODE) SEIR model of seasonal flu transmission to national
influenza data from the United States. We chose 2008-2009 as it preceded the 2009 pandemic
and 2003-2004 as a representative large season [29], and specifically analyzed weeks 1-15 of
2009 and week 45 of 2003 through week 3 of 2004. We estimated seasonal influenza incidence
(denoted ILI+) throughout these periods by multiplying the CDC’s ILINet estimates of influ-
enza activity by WHO public health lab estimates of percent positive flu tests [29], as suggested
by [66].
We implemented the Volz-Miller edge-based compartmental ODE model [67–69], which is
given by following equations:
SðtÞ ¼ cðyðtÞÞ
EðtÞ ¼ 1 � SðtÞ � IðtÞ � RðtÞ

The system can be understood by considering a test individual, u, which is a random indi-
vidual in the network chosen at time, t = 0. θ is the overall probability that a given contact of u
has not transmitted to u, and ϕS, ϕE, ϕI, and ϕR are the probabilities that the contact has not
transmitted to u and is currently susceptible, exposed, infectious, or recovered, respectively. S,
E, I, and R denote the proportion of the population in each state, and the parameters β, η, and
γ correspond to the per contact rate of transmission, the rate of becoming infectious upon
exposure, and the recovery rate, respectively. P(k) describes the degree distribution and tells us
the probability a random individual has degree k in the network. It follows that the average
degree is given by hki = ∑k kP(k). S(k, 0) is the probability a random individual of degree k is

 initially susceptible, which leads to the probability generating function describing the propor-
tion of susceptible individuals in the population (ψ) as, ψ(x) = ∑k S(k, 0)P(k)xk, where x is the
probability a given contact of u has not transmitted to u.
We match the parameters in this model to our stochastic two-strain model, including the
disease progression parameters (γ and η), network structures and the initial introduction of
five infections in a population of 10,000 (that is, Ið0Þ ¼ �Ið0Þ ¼

10000, ϕS(0) = 1 − ϕI(0), R =
ϕR(0) = ϕE(0) = 0, θ(0) = 1, and ϕI = ϕI(0)). We solved the system of equations numerically
using the deSolve package in R [70, 71].
To estimate both the per contact transmission rate, βseasonal, and time of epidemic introduc-
tion for each network, we minimized the sum of the squared errors between the 2008-2009 ILI
+ data and the incidence predictions from the ODE model, using the optim function in R [71].
Given that different network structures lead to different rates of epidemic growth, the flexible
epidemic start time allows tighter fitting of the models to the seasonal flu incidence data. For
the 2008-2009 season, we estimated the epidemic start date to be November 15th and Decem-
ber 18th, 2008 for the homogeneous and empirical networks, respectively [71].
Analytic approximations of emergence probability and effective R0
We derive mean field approximations of the emergence probabilities and effective R0 using the
process outlined in [72], which we outline briefly here. The generating function for the num-
ber of infected nodes in the first generation of an outbreak is given by
f ðxÞ ¼ p0 þ p1x þ � � � þ pjxj þ � � �
where pj is the probability the index case infects j neighbors. More specifically,

with Bi(k, j, T) denoting the probability of j successful outcomes from k Bernoulli trials with
probability of success equal to the transmissibility, T, defined by the probability distribution P
(T). (The probability distribution for T is defined by the randomly drawn recovery and infec-
tious times in the Gillespie simulation.) A node of degree k that has just been infected has k − 1
possible neighbors to infect. The probability that this node infects j neighbors is given by

Ignoring finite size effects, the generating function for the number of infections g generations

times. The extinction probability is the probability that eventually there are 0 infections
limg!1 f(hg−1(0)). Setting x0 = limg!1 hg−1(0) we find that the emergence probability in a
naïve network is given by

 It also follows that the basic reproduction number (R0) is given by

as originally shown in [73], where hTi is the average transmission probability. Under our con-

Statistical analysis of simulated epidemics
For a given scenario, we restricted our analyses to simulations in which a seasonal epidemic
actually occurred (defined as outbreaks with cumulative incidence reaching at least 5% of the
population). We then estimated the pandemic emergence probability as the number of pan-
demic introductions that progressed into sustained outbreaks (infecting at least 5% of the pop-
ulation) divided by the number of simulations with seasonal epidemics of that scenario. We
approximated the emergence timing of the pandemic as the first day in which the daily inci-
dence was �5 individuals, as this was a good indicator for the beginning of the exponential
growth phase.
Each time a pandemic successfully emerged, we estimated its Reff by fitting the correspond-
ing (empirical or homogeneous) single strain ODE network model (defined by equations in 1)
to the simulated pandemic time series. The procedure is as described in the Data and model
fitting section, with two alterations: (1) we fix the introduction time to that specified by the
simulation scenario and only estimate the transmission rate, and (2) we fit the model to the
cumulative incidence of the pandemic virus. To then obtain an R0 estimate, we plugged the esti-
mated pandemic transmission rate and full degree distribution into eq 3.
During the refractory period, immunity in the population increases the transmissibility nec-
essary for a pandemic to invade the population. We use eq 3 to estimate this changing invasion
threshold; we let hk2i and hki reflect the current susceptible portion of the network, set R0 = 1,
and solve for T. For a given time point t and scenario, we calculated T for a single, prototypical
simulation and divided it by the comparable threshold in a completely susceptible population.
Importantly, this analysis assumes that the network susceptibility is frozen in time at the intro-
duction time, and does not take into account subsequent epidemic and pandemic dynamics.
Results
We fit two network models—an empirical model and a homogeneous model (roughly equiva-
lent to a simple mass action model)—to influenza data from the 2008-2009 season in the US
(Fig 2A), and estimated reproduction numbers (R0) of 1.8 and 1.4, respectively (Analogous
results for the larger 2003-2004 flu season are presented in Supplementary Material). Both esti-
mates are consistent with prior studies [26, 74], and their discrepancy highlights a potential
pitfall of simple epidemiological models. Given the observed heterogeneity in human social
behavior [65], the mass action models, which assume that all individuals have identical contact
rates, may underestimate epidemic potential. Using these estimates of R0, we simulate typical
seasonal influenza epidemics and estimate the evolving probability of pandemic emergence.
We assume an average 42-day period of complete heterosubtypic immunity upon recovery
from a seasonal flu infection (S2 Fig), which corresponds to the waning of generalized immu-
nity in a human club cell-like line [53] and lies in between other estimates [44, 47]. We provide
a sensitivity analysis with respect to the duration of immunity in the supplementary informa-
tion (S3 Fig).

example, if a pandemic with R0 = 2.5 emerged in March of 2009 and we did not account for population immunity, we would interpret the
Reff as the R0 and considerably underestimate the true transmission rate (R0 � 2), regardless of our contact network assumptions.

 Pandemic refractory period
Heterosubtypic immunity is expected to reduce pandemic emergence during the seasonal epi-
demic, with pandemic emergence probability reaching a minimum just after the epidemic
peak of the flu season and then quickly rebounding (Fig 2B). The length and intensity of this
pandemic refractory period should increase with the duration of heterosubtypic immunity,
with prolonged immunity leading to complete pandemic exclusion (S3 Fig).
The refractory period also depends on the transmissibility of the pandemic virus: the
greater the transmission rate, the more readily a pandemic will emerge with or without immu-
nological interference; the opposite is true for less transmissible viruses (S9 Fig). The refractory
effect is greater in the empirical (network) model than in the homogeneous model, suggesting
that mass action assumptions may lead to underestimation of viral interference and overesti-
mation of pandemic risk. Assuming that the pandemic virus has the same intrinsic transmis-
sion rate as the seasonal virus, the probability of pandemic emergence is reduced by 73% and
62% in the empirical and homogeneous models, respectively, at the base of the refractory
period, relative to comparable introductions in a completely susceptible population. Higher
transmission rates lead to smaller reductions (56% and 19% respectively), while less transmis-
sible viruses can be almost fully excluded (99% and 84% reductions respectively) (S9 Fig). The
2008-2009 influenza season was relatively mild; larger seasonal flu epidemics produce deeper
refractory periods, as illustrated for the 2003-2004 influenza season (S4, S5 and S6 Figs).
Underestimation of pandemic R0
For each simulated pandemic that successfully emerges, we estimate the effective R0 (Reff) of
the virus, the reproduction number of the disease in a population that is not fully susceptible.
Its magnitude depends on the extent of immunological interference by seasonal flu. Generally,
the Reff of the emerging pandemic virus decreases as the seasonal epidemic progresses towards
its peak, bottoming out slightly before the emergence probability reaches its minimum. How-
ever, this occurs slightly earlier and more precipitously in the empirical model than in the
homogeneous model (Fig 2C).
Whether or not a virus emerges depends on its intrinsic infectiousness and structure of the
susceptible portion of the population. During the refractory period, the susceptible population
is diminished, both in number and connectivity. At the peak of the refractory period in the
empirical network, we estimate that a introduced virus must be 1.16 times more infectious
(transmissible) to emerge, relative to one entering a completely susceptible population. If the
seasonal epidemics preceding the 1918 and 2009 pandemics were similar in timing and magni-
tude to our simulated epidemics, then we estimate that their intrinsic R0’s would have been
1.08–1.20 and 1.05–1.13 times larger, respectively, than their Reff’s as the first waves emerged.
Contact networks determine pandemic vulnerability
The different levels of pandemic risk observed in our two models stem from their underlying
contact networks. To illustrate this, we use nodes and edges to represent individuals and con-
tacts between individuals, respectively. The degree of a node is defined as the number of edges
connecting it to other nodes. The homogeneous model assumes that all individuals have the
same number of contacts; the empirical model assumes realistic variation in degree [65]. We
constrained the two models to have the same total number of nodes and empirically-derived
mean degree, and, consequently, the same total number of edges.
The susceptible portion of a network is the subset of individuals that are currently suscepti-
ble to pandemic infection and any connections among them (Fig 3, orange circles and lines).
(This is also known as the residual network [75].) The susceptible degree of a susceptible node is
Seasonality in risk of pandemic influenza emergence

 the number of contacts it has with other susceptibles. Upon infection by seasonal flu, individu-
als and their coincident edges leave the susceptible network, returning only when their hetero-
specific influenza immunity wanes. This dynamic wake of immunity depends on the
underlying network structure and, importantly, determines the population’s vulnerability to
pandemic emergence (Fig 3, grey nodes and edges).
As a disease spreads, the chance of a node becoming infected will depend on its degree. The
more contacts a node has, the higher its exposure risk. In a homogeneous network, chains of
transmission progress randomly; in a heterogeneous network, outbreaks hit the most con-
nected nodes earliest and hardest. Consider two emerging outbreaks–one in the empirical net-
work and another in the homogeneous network–that have reached the same cumulative
incidence. Although the susceptible networks will have identical numbers of susceptible nodes,
the empirical susceptible network will be much sparser (fewer edges) than the homogeneous
counterpart, and will thus be more refractory to pandemic invasion (Fig 3, middle panels).
In a randomly selected pair of simulations, the homogeneous network decays to an suscep-
tible network consisting of 71% of its original nodes and 43% of its original edges, before
rebounding (Fig 4A). In contrast, the empirical network maintains more nodes (78%) and
fewer edges (36%) at its most refractory moment, with the high degree nodes bearing the
brunt of the seasonal epidemic (Fig 4B and 4C).
Seasonal pandemic emergence timing
The above analyses assume that pandemic emergence is constrained solely by heterosubtypic
immunity, and do not consider the socio-environmental factors that shape seasonal flu
Fig 3. The evolving structure of the susceptible population as the flu season unfolds. For purposes of illustration, we present
caricatures of each model through time, assuming that the average degree is hki = 6 and that we repeatedly observe the same subset of
each population. Orange represents individuals susceptible to infection by the pandemic virus and the contacts between them; gray indicates
individuals who are currently or recently infected by the seasonal virus, and thus immune to pandemic infection. The empirical (top) and
homogeneous (bottom) networks experience different structural changes in pandemic susceptibility throughout the flu season. In January,
prior to the onset of flu season, both networks are fully susceptible. Just following the seasonal epidemic peak (March), both networks are at
the base of their refractory period, with many nodes resistant to the pandemic virus. Even with the same number of susceptible nodes, the
empirical network is more disrupted than the homogeneous network. Highly connected (hub) nodes are more vulnerable to seasonal
infection than less connected nodes and, once removed by immunity, critically disconnect the susceptible portion of network. After the
seasonal epidemic has subsided (June), short-term immunity has largely waned in both models, leaving them vulnerable to pandemic
invasion.

 dynamics. When we incorporate humidity-forced seasonality into the model, we find that pan-
demics are most likely to emerge soon after the seasonal epidemic peak (Fig 5), with the timing
more constrained to the spring and early summer in the empirical network than in the homo-
geneous network. For both models, the most probable week of emergence falls within one
week of the actual 2009 pandemic emergence event. To assess the consistency of our models
with observed pandemics (five emerged in the spring and one emerged in the summer), we
conduct multinomial tests of the model-derived probabilities of emergence across each of the
four seasons. While the empirical and homogeneous models are consistent with recent history
(multinomial exact test p = 0.53 and p = 0.35, respectively), the simple null model in which
emergence risk is assumed to be constant throughout the year is not (p < 0.05). Although all
historic pandemics seem consistent with the model, we note that these estimates are based on
the 2008-2009 flu season and thus strictly pertain only to the 2009 pandemic. We speculate
that projections from the seasons preceding each of the other historical pandemics would be
similar and perhaps even better aligned with the emergence of the corresponding pandemic.

progression. For any given number of remaining susceptible individuals, the empirical model is always sparser than the homogeneous model (that is, it

infection, across different levels of connectivity. (We bin degrees by 10; for example, the lowest bin includes individuals with 1 to 10 contacts). For
comparison, the horizontal dashed line indicates the overall proportion of individuals immunized in the network at the base of the refractory period. In
comparison to an individual with an average number of contacts, a highly connected individual will be more vulnerable to seasonal flu infection, and, once
infected and immunized, cause greater epidemiological disruption.

sistent with historic pandemic timing (S7 Fig (p < 0.05) and S8 Fig (p < 0.05)).
Discussion
The coincidental timing of recent pandemics may reflect multiple constraints, including envi-
ronmental and behavioral factors that shape influenza’s transmissibility (e.g. humidity, school
calendar, etc.), reassortment events mediated by co-infection, and immune-mediated competi-
tion between pandemic and established viruses [31–33, 44, 76]. On the one hand, we would
expect pandemics to emerge during the flu season, when socio-environmental conditions are
conducive to influenza transmission and co-infections are likely; on the other hand, those
would be the months of greatest competitive interference. These competing effects suggest that
the risk of pandemic emergence may be greatest at the tail of the flu season, when conditions
are still favorable and co-infections are possible, but competition is waning. Consider the fol-
lowing scenario. A novel virus is produced by co-infection mediated reassortment during the
heart of the influenza season. It initially stutters, hindered by widespread heterosubtypic
immunity, but does not completely disappear. With each new infection, emergence is possible
and increasingly probable, as heterosubtypic immunity dissipates. This is consistent with the
timing of all recent pandemics (Fig 1), most of which (all but 1977) were caused by livestock-
human reassortment viruses [34, 35, 76–78].
Pandemic emergence requires both the evolution of novel pandemic subtypes capable of
human-to-human transmission and the ability of such new viruses to spread once they have
appeared in humans. Our study focuses exclusively on the latter process, the success of new
human-transmissible influenza viruses facing dynamic short-term heterosubtypic immunity
resulting from seasonal influenza. Specifically, we have modeled a scenario in which

pandemics that emerge during the seasonal influenza epidemic for the homogeneous (purple) and empirical (green) networks.
Pandemic emergence timing, the time in which the simulated pandemic begins rapid spread, is defined as the day the pandemic strain
incidence reaches five or more cases. Results are for a pandemic emerging during the 2008-2009 flu season with the same
transmission rate as the seasonal epidemic. Vertical lines indicate the timing of historic pandemics, with the solid line indicating the
timing of the 2009 pandemic and dashed lines indicating timing of others.

 potentially pandemic viruses appear (starting with a single infection) with constant probability
during or following a typical Northern Hemisphere flu season. Individuals infected by seasonal
flu are assumed to enjoy a short period of immunity towards other influenza subtypes, includ-
ing the novel pandemic virus. Under reasonable assumptions regarding the duration of hetero-
subtypic immunity and human contact patterns, we characterize the changing risk of
pandemic emergence throughout the flu season and find a considerable refractory period that
is consistent with historical pandemic emergence events in the spring and summer months.
The rate of pandemic spread will depend on the time of emergence. Pandemics emerging
during the seasonal refractory period will initially grow slowly and accelerate as residual
immunity dissipates. Thus, the threat and pace of global expansion may far exceed projections
based on early estimates of the viral reproduction number (R0). In our model based on the
2008-2009 flu season, we estimate that, at the peak of the refractory period, naturally occurring
immunity will reduce the probability of pandemic emergence 73% and reduce the reproduc-
tion number of a successfully emerging virus by 30%. We assumed that all recovered individu-
als experience full protection during their short period of heterosubtypic immunity. If, for
example, heterosubtypic immunity is incomplete or fails to prevent subsequent spread, the
refractory effect may be diminished. Nonetheless, the qualitative results, including the timing
of the refractory period and differences between the two network models should still hold.
Our comparison between homogeneous and empirical contact networks suggests that,
while the refractory effect is robust, estimation of pandemic risk prior to and during emer-
gence events will be highly sensitive to statistical assumptions regarding population structure.
Several other studies have examined the impact of network structure on herd immunity fol-
lowing an epidemic or vaccination campaign, and similarly found that contact heterogeneity
amplifies the refractory effect [75, 79–81]. Conventional models, that ignore social heterogene-
ity, are likely to overestimate both the emergence risk during the refractory period and the
early transmission rate (R0) of an emerging pandemic virus. Given the simplicity and growing
flexibility of network methods, this further supports their scientific and public health utility
[67, 82, 83].
Pandemics often emerge in multiple waves [84], including a herald wave in the spring or
summer and a secondary wave the following fall or winter. These wave patterns are well docu-
mented for the 1918, 1957, and 2009 pandemics [25, 85–91]. Our results provide potential
insight into this phenomenon. The asynchronous forces of heterosubtypic herd immunity and
suppressive off-season conditions may constrain pandemic emergence to the immediate wake
of the flu season, exactly when lingering population-wide immunity is expected to dampen the
initial wave of pandemic transmission. In the months following, the limited herald wave runs
its course, residual seasonal immunity continues to decline, and socio-environmental condi-
tions slowly become more conducive to flu transmission, thereby setting the stage for a major
winter pandemic wave. Early estimates of pandemic R0 that do not properly account for under-
lying population immunity may substantially underestimate the magnitude of the second (fall
or winter) pandemic wave, as the Reff at the time of emergence may be considerably lower than
R0 in a fully susceptible population. Our analysis suggests that a pandemic emerging between
March and June may produce a secondary wave with an Reff that is 4–28% larger than the initial
Reff, depending on the duration of heterosubtypic immunity, the timing of emergence, and the
baseline transmissibility of the virus. Recent analyses of the 1918 and 2009 pandemic waves
found that the initial waves were 3.6% and 6.5% less transmissible than the secondary wave,
supporting our conclusions [61, 92]. This finding is broadly consistent with published estimates
for the reproduction numbers of primary and secondary pandemic waves, with the exception
of the 1918 pandemic in Denmark [26, 85]. This discrepancy may be attributable to poor data
or stem from local differences in the preceding flu season or population structure.

 Most historic pandemic viruses were likely created by recent livestock-human reassortment
events [34–36], with two possible exceptions. The 1977 pandemic was caused by a lab escapee,
and the 2009 pandemic evolved from a human-derived variant that circulated in swine for
years before the precipitating reassortment event, which may have occurred in livestock several
months or years prior to its 2009 emergence [35]. We have assumed that pandemic introduc-
tions will be constrained to the flu season for two reasons (Fig 5). First, the chance of a live-
stock-human reassortment event will depend on the prevalence of flu in both humans and
livestock, and thus increase as seasonal flu gains momentum. Second, flu prevalence in live-
stock is thought to mirror seasonal flu in humans [93, 94]. Thus, even viruses emerging
directly from livestock, without a precipitating human reassortment event, may be constrained
to the same months.
When we remove this assumption and introduce pandemic viruses throughout the year,
the plausible emergence times start earlier in the fall, before the seasonal flu epidemic takes
hold (S7 and S8 Figs). This broader emergence scenario is inconsistent with historical pan-
demics, given that none emerged in the fall just prior to a seasonal epidemic. While this does
not prove our seasonality assumptions, it suggests that there may be factors restricting emer-
gence events in the fall, such as the ones we have hypothesized, or that fall emergence simply
has not occurred, by chance alone, across the limited number of recent pandemics. Our study
was not designed to detect such seasonal constraints on pandemic emergence (rather we
assume them and analyze the consequences), but leaves this as an interesting open question
for future work. Interestingly, the broader emergence scenario may apply to the 1977 pan-
demic, which, unlike the other recent pandemics, did not emerge directly from influenza cir-
culating in livestocks or humans, as well as to risks associated with future gain-of-function
avian influenza experiments.
This approach can be readily applied to other retrospective or predictive global risk assess-
ments, using seasonal flu surveillance data at the relevant geographic and temporal scale [95,
96]. Our results suggest that Southern hemisphere pandemic risk will be greatest in September
and October following their respective flu season [97]. Tropical and subtropical regions, which
have low levels of sporadic flu transmission, seasonal patterns, or bimodal seasonality should
experience refractory periods in the wakes of their respective epidemics [98–102]. Estimating
spatiotemporal emergence risks will require data-driven models that consider local flu season-
ality and contact networks, both of which can vary greatly with climatic zone and human
developmental index. Such analyses can support pandemic planning, including the targeting
of surveillance systems for detecting emergence events around the globe [10, 103].
Our model makes several assumptions about the transmissibility of both seasonal and pan-
demic influenza viruses. We assume that the intrinsic transmission rates depend on humidity
(Fig 5), and do not explicitly consider other environmental and sociological factors that may
be important (e.g., school calendar) [33, 104]. Since we estimated pandemic emergence loca-
tions and dates based on reports of major outbreaks, our estimates may be biased towards
regions with high reporting rates or population densities. Our study is further limited by the
small number of pandemic emergence event; with five natural pandemics emerging in sub-
tropical and temperate climates, we lack the power to fit high resolution predictive model.
Instead, we used the North American 2008-2009 influenza season as a prototypical flu season
for exploring seasonal and immunological drivers of pandemic risk. The flu seasons preceding
the other 20th century pandemics likely varied in both timing and magnitude. Additional his-
torical data from those pandemics and their preceding seasons might enable more reliable spa-
tiotemporal estimates of pandemic emergence risk and the duration of cross-immunity.
Recent pandemics exhibited similar timing and geographic origins, having all emerged in
the Northern Hemisphere. Why this is so, and whether it suggests higher risk of future

 pandemic emergence in the Northern Hemisphere is yet unknown. Molecular analyses suggest
that seasonal flu diversity is seeded in the Northern Hemisphere (Southeast Asia) [41]. Fur-
thermore, human and livestock populations tend to have higher densities in the Northern
Hemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere [105, 106]. These two factors could suggest that
the Northern Hemisphere may be a likely source for future pandemics. If influenza refractory
periods are estimated for other climatic zones, as we have done here for the Northern Hemi-
sphere, we may better understand the common origins of past pandemics and gain actionable
insights into global dynamics of pandemic risk.
We also focus exclusively on transient heterosubtypic immunity immediately following sea-
sonal flu infection, which is only one of many forms of immunological heterogeneity that may
constrain pandemic emergence. For example, the age-specific rate of severe and deadly infec-
tions of novel H7N9 and H5N1 in China reflect long-lasting heterosubtypic immunity stem-
ming from early childhood influenza infections [48]. Our model does not consider such long-
term heterogeneity in susceptibility, nor does it consider intrinsic heterogeneity in heterosub-
typic immunity following infection (e.g., variation in severity, transmissibility, or infectious
period) [45, 57]. Incorporating historically-acquired immunity, individual heterogeneity, and
future advances in our understanding of transient heterosubtypic immunity should improve
pandemic risk assessments.
Our study is intended as a proof of concept. Using simple, conservative models of influenza
transmission, cross-immunity, and seasonality, we lend support to a parsimonious explanation
for the historical spring-summer timing of pandemic emergence and demonstrate that pan-
demic risk may be both seasonal and predictable. However, there is much we still cannot pre-
dict, such as when and where reassorted viruses capable of human-to-human transmission will
arise. Recent human outbreaks of H7N9 and H5N1 influenza during the winter and spring
months suggest that other factors may inhibit spread, such as intrinsic transmissibility and the
underlying immunological landscape [48, 107, 108]. Although we do not address the biogeo-
graphic risks of novel viruses first arising through reassortment events in humans or livestock,
laboratory experimentation, or other mechanisms, our study provides insight into the subse-
quent risk of emergence and a method for estimating such risk from seasonal flu surveillance
data. As we gain a better understanding of breadth and duration of heterosubtypic immunity,
both in general and between specific combinations of influenza viruses, our insights and meth-
odology can be applied to improve global surveillance, detection, planning and intervention
efforts for pandemic influenza.

days in the immune state. As the influenza epidemics we model last 100 days or more, the
