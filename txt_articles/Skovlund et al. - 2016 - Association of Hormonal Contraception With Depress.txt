IMPORTANCE Millions of women worldwide use hormonal contraception. Despite the clinical
evidence of an influence of hormonal contraception on some women’
s mood, associations
between the use of hormonal contraception and mood disturbances remain inadequately
addressed.
OBJECTIVE To investigate whether the use of hormonal contraception is positively associated
with subsequent use of antidepressants and a diagnosis of depression at a psychiatric
hospital.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This nationwide prospective cohort study combined
data from the National Prescription Register and the Psychiatric Central Research Register in
Denmark. All women and adolescents aged 15 to 34 years who were living in Denmark were
followed up from January 1, 2000, to December 2013, if they had no prior depression
diagnosis, redeemed prescription for antidepressants, other major psychiatric diagnosis,
cancer, venous thrombosis, or infertility treatment. Data were collected from January 1, 1995,
to December 31, 2013, and analyzed from January 1, 2015, through April 1, 2016.
EXPOSURES Use of different types of hormonal contraception.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES With time-varying covariates, adjusted incidence rate ratios
(RRs) were calculated for first use of an antidepressant and first diagnosis of depression at a
psychiatric hospital.
RESULTS A total of 1 061 997 women (mean [SD] age, 24.4 [0.001] years; mean [SD]
follow-up, 6.4 [0.004] years) were included in the analysis. Compared with nonusers, users
of combined oral contraceptives had an RR of first use of an antidepressant of 1.23 (95% CI,
1.22-1.25). Users of progestogen-only pills had an RR for first use of an antidepressant of 1.34
(95% CI, 1.27-1.40); users of a patch (norgestrolmin), 2.0 (95% CI, 1.76-2.18); users of a vaginal
ring (etonogestrel), 1.6 (95% CI, 1.55-1.69); and users of a levonorgestrel intrauterine system,
1.4 (95% CI, 1.31-1.42). For depression diagnoses, similar or slightly lower estimates were
found. The relative risks generally decreased with increasing age. Adolescents (age range,
15-19 years) using combined oral contraceptives had an RR of a first use of an antidepressant
of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.75-1.84) and those using progestin-only pills, 2.2 (95% CI, 1.99-2.52). Six
months after starting use of hormonal contraceptives, the RR of antidepressant use peaked
at 1.4 (95% CI, 1.34-1.46). When the reference group was changed to those who never used
hormonal contraception, the RR estimates for users of combined oral contraceptives
increased to 1.7 (95% CI, 1.66-1.71).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Use of hormonal contraception, especially among adolescents,
was associated with subsequent use of antidepressants and a first diagnosis of depression,
suggesting depression as a potential adverse effect of hormonal contraceptive use.

velopedanddevelopingcountries.1Thelifetimepreva-
lence of depression is about twice as high in women
as in men across different populations.2-5 Nevertheless, be-
forepuberty,girlsarefoundtobeequallyorlessdepressedthan
boys.6,7 The 2 female sex hormones—estrogen and progester-
one—have been hypothesized to play a role in the cause of de-
pressive symptoms.8-12 In a recent review, Toffoletto et al13
found initial evidence that sex steroid hormones have an in-
fluence on the cortical and subcortical regions implicated in
emotional and cognitive processing. Gingnell et al14 found that
use of combined oral contraceptives among women who pre-
viously had experienced emotional adverse effects resulted in
mood deterioration and changes in emotional brain reactiv-
ity. The addition of progesterone to hormone therapy has been
shown to induce adverse mood effects in women.15,16 Likely
mechanisms also include the action of progesterone metabo-
lites on the γ-aminobutyric acid A receptor complex, which is
the major inhibitory system in the human central nervous
system.17 Levels of neuroactive metabolites of progesterone
increase during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle in fer-
tile women, and some experience negative mood symptoms.17
Moreover,externalprogestins,probablymorethannaturalpro-
gesterone, increase levels of monoamine oxidase, which de-
grades serotonin concentrations and thus potentially pro-
duces depression and irritability.18 Clinical studies have
indicated that changes in estrogen levels may trigger depres-
sive episodes among women at risk for depression19 and that
women with major depression generally have lower estradiol
levels than do control individuals.20 Freeman et al21 found that
women with a faster transition to menopause followed by
stable hormone levels had fewer depressive symptoms. In a
recent double-blind placebo-controlled study,22 women were
randomized to sex hormone manipulation with groserelin (go-
nadotropin-releasing hormone agonist) implant or placebo,
which triggered subclinical depressive symptoms in the inter-
vention group. The depressive symptoms were positively as-
sociated with the net decrease in estradiol levels.
Few studies have quantified the effect of modern low-
dosehormonalcontraceptiveuseontheriskfordepression.23-28
Two studies24-26 found teenage users of progestin-only con-
traception to be more frequent users of antidepressants than
nonusers of hormonal contraceptives. One study23 found no
association between oral contraceptive use and mood symp-
toms, and 3 studies25,27,28 suggested that the use of hor-
monal contraception was associated with better mood. We
found few prior studies that assessed the effect of hormonal
contraceptives on the risk for subsequent depression in a pro-
spectivecohortdesignandnonethattookintoaccountthetem-
porality between use of hormonal contraceptives and devel-
opment of depression.
Because mood symptoms are a known reason for cessa-
tion of hormonal contraceptive use,29-31 cross-sectional stud-
ies are vulnerable to healthy-user bias causing underestima-
tion of a possible influence on depression. Because hormonal
contraception introduces synthetic hormones and modu-
lates the internal hormone production, an examination of the

Methods
Study Population
The Danish Sex Hormone Register Study32 is an ongoing na-
tionwide cohort study that includes all women living in Den-
mark. The cohort was identified by the unique personal iden-
tification number given to all Danish citizens at birth or
immigration. This number is used in all public registers, allow-
ingreliablelinkageofdatabetweenregisters.Thedatabaseswere
availablethroughStatisticsDenmark,andapprovalfortheiruse
was obtained from the Danish Data Protection Agency, which
also determined that informed consent was not required be-
cause the study used deidentified data from large databases.
In the present study, we observed adolescents and women
aged 15 to 34 years (hereinafter referred to as women) at any
time during the 14 years from January 1, 2000, to December
31, 2013, and in the previous 5-year period. To ensure that in-
cident events of depression were identified, all women with
a depression diagnosis or use of antidepressants before Janu-
ary1,2000,orbeforetheir15thbirthdaywereexcluded,aswere
all women with other major psychiatric diagnoses using the
following codes from the International Statistical Classifica-
tion of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision:
organic, DF0*; manic episode, DF30; bipolar affective disor-
der,DF31*;schizophrenia,DF2*;andmentalretardation,DF7*.
To exclude women with contraindications against the use of
hormonal contraceptives, women with a diagnosis of cancer
or venous thrombosis or who underwent treatment for infer-
tility before study entry were excluded. The National Health
Register provided data on discharge diagnoses of cancer and
venous thrombosis since 1977, and the Psychiatric Central Re-
search Register provided data on psychiatric diagnoses for all
inpatients and outpatients since 1995. Infertility was defined
ashavingaredeemedprescriptionofovarian-stimulatingdrugs
(Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system code
MG03G in the National Prescription Register). Daily updated
information on immigration, emigration, and death was ob-
tainedfromStatisticsDenmark.Womenimmigratingafter1995
Key Points
Question Is use of hormonal contraception associated with
treatment of depression?
Findings In a nationwide prospective cohort study of more than
1 million women living in Denmark, an increased risk for first use of
an antidepressant and first diagnosis of depression was found
among users of different types of hormonal contraception, with
the highest rates among adolescents.
Meaning Health care professionals should be aware of this
relatively hitherto unnoticed adverse effect of hormonal
contraception.

 were excluded to ensure information on prior depression and
other censoring variables for at least 5 years before study en-
try. The National Birth Register provided information on births
since 1973 (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
Hormonal Contraception
The National Prescription Register provided individual expo-
sureinformationonprescribedandredeemedmedicationfrom
all Danish pharmacies since 1995 and was categorized accord-
ing to estrogen type and dose, progestin type, and route of ad-
ministration (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Use of hormonal
contraception was modeled as time-varying covariates, with
information updated daily. All prescriptions were extended
with 28 days or less if a new prescription was redeemed.33 Hor-
moneusewasdefinedascurrentorrecentuse(cessationwithin
the previous 6 months) to ensure that women who quit hor-
monal contraceptive use owing to depression but before any
treatment was initiated were considered exposed to hor-
monal contraceptives. The reference group consisted of non-
users, defined as those who never used hormonal contracep-
tives plus former users.
Depression
Two outcome measures for incident depression were ad-
dressed. First, a first redeemed prescription of an antidepres-
sant was recorded in the National Prescription Register (eTable
2 in the Supplement). The National Prescription Register cov-
ers all redeemed prescriptions of antidepressants from Dan-
ish pharmacies, including 98.7% of all antidepressants used
in Denmark. The second outcome was a first discharge diag-
nosis of depression from the Psychiatric Central Research Reg-
ister, defined by codes F32 to F33.9 from the International Sta-
tistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems,
Tenth Revision. This outcome included all inpatients and out-
patients at psychiatric departments in Denmark since 1995.
Covariates
Statistics Denmark delivered data for all women on age, length
of schooling, and ongoing or completed educational level (un-
known, elementary school only, high school only, skilled
worker, theoretical education, and theoretical education with
research qualifications). Diagnoses of polycystic ovary syn-
drome and endometriosis were obtained from the National
Health Register. The National Birth Register provided infor-
mation on body mass index (calculated as weight in kilo-
grams divided by height in meters squared) (by categories of
<18.5, 18.5-25.0, >25.0 to 30.0, and >30.0) since 2004 and
smoking habits (yes or no) since 1991 for all women who had
been pregnant.
Statistical Analysis
All women in the study population were followed up from en-
try (January 1, 2000, or 15th birthday) and until event, emi-
gration, death, or the end of follow-up on December 31, 2013,
whichever came first. Women were censored during the study
periodforthesamereasonsastheprimaryexclusionsandtem-
porarily during pregnancy and 6 months after delivery. To ac-
count for age and time trends in depression, we adjusted for
calendar year and age using 1-year bands. We also adjusted for
educational level, polycystic ovary syndrome, and endome-
triosis. Incidence rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs were calcu-
lated using Poisson regression.
Among women starting hormonal contraceptive use in the
study period, we assessed the effect of duration of use com-
paredwithnonusers.Amongparouswomen,anadditionalsen-
sitivity analysis adjusted for smoking and body mass index.
In 2 additional analyses, RRs among users of different hor-
monal contraception product types were calculated, with us-
ers of a combination of ethinyl estradiol, 30 to 40 μg, and le-
vonorgestrel as the reference group or with those who never
used hormonal contraceptives as the reference group.
Finally, sensitivity analyses were conducted on the sub-
cohort of women who started hormonal contraceptive use
sometime during the study period. Each woman contributed
to the exposed and unexposed observation time. Among
women who started use of hormonal contraceptives, inci-
dence rates within 1 year after initiation of hormonal contra-
ceptionwerecomparedwiththeincidencerateduringthetime
beforetheinitiationofhormonalcontraceptiveuse.Wethereby
controlled for all potential confounders, which did not change
duringtheobservationperiodandeliminatedhealthy-userbias.
Results
The study population included 1 061 997 women (mean [SD]
age,24.4[0.001]years;mean[SD]follow-up,6.4[0.004]years)
and6 832 938person-yearsofobservationduringthestudype-
riod. During follow-up, 55.5% of women were current or re-
cent users of hormonal contraception. Use of hormonal con-
traception according to age in 2013 is illustrated in eFigure 2
in the Supplement. Within the first year of hormonal contra-
ceptive use, 0.04% of women changed to another product and
10% ceased using their product. A total of 133 178 first pre-
scriptions of antidepressants and 23 077 first diagnoses of de-
pression were detected during follow-up. Data were analyzed
from January 1, 2015, through April 1, 2016.
Characteristics of Users of Hormonal Contraception
Womenusinghormonalcontraceptionwereamean(SD)of24.3
(0.01) years of age; nonusers were a mean (SD) of 24.4 (0.01)
years of age. Users of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system
were a mean (SD) of 31 (0.05) years of age. Women using 50
μg of combined oral contraceptives, implants, or medroxy-
progesterone acetate depot were more likely to have a lower
educational level than were women using other types of hor-
monal contraception. That tendency was most pronounced for
women using medroxyprogesterone acetate depot (Table 1).
Hormonal Contraception and Depression
Among all users of hormonal contraceptives, the crude inci-
dence rate of first use of antidepressants was 2.2 per 100 per-
son-years; that of first diagnosis of depression at a psychiat-
richospital,0.3per100person-years.Thecorrespondingcrude
incidence rates in nonusers of hormonal contraception were
1.7 and 0.28 per 100 person-years, respectively.

 Compared with nonusers, users of combined oral contra-
ceptives experienced an RR of a first use of antidepressants of
1.2 (95% CI, 1.22 to 1.25). Women using progestin-only pills had
an RR of 1.3 (95% CI, 1.27-1.40); a transdermal patch (norges-
trolmin), 2.0 (95% CI, 1.76-2.18); a vaginal ring (etonogestrel),
1.6 (95% CI, 1.55-1.69); an implant, 2.1 (95% CI, 2.01-2.24); a
levonorgestrel intrauterine system, 1.4 (95% CI, 1.31-1.42); and
medroxyprogesterone acetate depot, 2.7 (95% CI, 2.45-2.87).
The RRs of a first diagnosis of depression were slightly lower
or similar (Table 2).
Age-stratified analyses demonstrated decreasing RRs of a
first use of antidepressants with increasing age for the most
commonlyusedproducts(Figure1).Analysesrestrictedtoado-
lescents (aged 15-19 years) showed notably higher RRs of first
use of antidepressants and first diagnosis of depression. Com-
pared with nonusers, users of combined oral contraceptives
experienced a 1.8-fold higher rate (95% CI, 1.75-1.84) of first
use of antidepressants; users of progestin-only pills experi-
enced a 2.2-fold higher rate (95% CI, 1.99-2.52). Nonoral prod-
ucts implied a 3-fold increased risk for first use of antidepres-
sants.TheRRsforafirstdiagnosisofdepressionatapsychiatric
hospital were similar or slightly lower (Table 3).
Assessment of the association between the duration of use
and the risk for first use of antidepressants demonstrated in-
creasing relative risks with length of use. For use of hormonal
contraceptives of less than 1 month, RRs were 1.1 (95% CI, 0.95-
1.15) for first use of antidepressants and 1.2 (95% CI, 1.00-
1.44) for first diagnosis of depression; for 1 to less than 2

0.88), respectively (unity), for use of 7 to less than 10 years
(Figure 2).
When additionally adjusting for smoking and body mass
index among parous women, the RR of first use of antidepres-
sants did not change significantly for almost all products. An
exception was the RR among women who used medroxypro-
gesterone acetate depot, which decreased from 2.4 (95% CI,
2.09-2.75) to 1.9 (95% CI, 1.65-2.16) with adjustment for con-
founders (eFigure 3 in the Supplement). When use of oral con-
traceptives that combined levonorgestrel and 30 to 40 μg of
ethinyl estradiol constituted the reference group, a signifi-
cantly higher rate of antidepressant use was found among
women who used combined oral contraceptives with cypro-
terone acetate, natural estrogen with dienogest, and a patch
or a vaginal ring (eTable 3 in the Supplement). When chang-
ingthereferencegrouptothosewhoneverusedhormonalcon-

 Sensitivity Analyses on Starting Use
of Hormonal Contraceptives
Compared with before use, the RR of antidepressant use 1 year
afterinitiationofcombinedoralcontraceptiveusewas1.6(95%
CI, 1.58-1.69). Stratified by age groups, adolescents aged 15 to
19 years who started use of hormonal contraceptives had an
RR of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.72-1.88). Women aged 20 to 30 years who
started use of hormonal contraceptives had an RR of 1.4 (95%
CI, 1.29-1.47) (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In this study, use of all types of hormonal contraceptives was
positively associated with a subsequent use of antidepres-
santsandadiagnosisofdepression.Thatfindingcomplieswith
the theory of progesterone involvement in the etiology of de-
pression, because progestin dominates combined and proges-
tin-only contraceptives. The high risk among women using the
transdermal patch and vaginal ring compared with the corre-
sponding pill is probably a question of dose rather than the
route of administration.34 Progestin-only products, includ-
ing the levonorgestrel intrauterine system, also implied an in-
creased risk for the use of antidepressants and a diagnosis of
depression, supporting the finding that although the levo-
norgestrel intrauterine system primarily works locally, it also
delivers levonorgestrel to the systemic circulation.35 Adoles-
cent women who used hormonal contraception experienced
higher risks than women in general.
Strengths
Among the strengths of this study was the primarily nonse-
lective inclusion of all adolescents and women aged 15 to 34
years living in Denmark and followed up for 14 years with no
loss to follow-up and a study population of 1 million women.
The information on the use of hormonal contraception and an-
tidepressants was obtained through bar codes, eliminating re-
call bias. Women who used an antidepressant or had a diag-
nosis of depression before study entry were excluded. Next,
women were temporarily censored during pregnancy and 6
months after delivery to reduce the influence of postpartum
depression. Information on hormonal contraceptive use was
updated daily and used as a time-varying covariate. Finally,
we used alternative analysis strategies with 2 different out-
comesandconductedanumberofsensitivityanalyses,allwith
consistent results.
Limitations
We do not expect general practitioners to be more likely to pre-
scribe hormonal contraception to women at risk for depres-
sion because depression is mentioned in the leaflet as a pos-
sible adverse effect. Therefore, the opposite selection is more

 likely,implyingapotentialunderestimationoftherelativerisks.
Weexpectthatinstitutionalizedwomenandwomenwithmen-
tal retardation or more severe psychiatric illness could be more
likely to receive long-acting reversible contraceptive products
such as medroxyprogesterone acetate depot or implants. Al-
though we do not have a reference to support this concern, we
decidedtoexcludethese2specificproductsintheresultstables
because they might be influenced by confounding by indica-
tion. For the remaining products, these specific women ac-
count for a vanishing small fraction of all women using hor-
monal contraception. Thus, 80% of the female population in
Denmark has used hormonal contraception some time during
their reproductive life, which explains why women using hor-
monal contraceptives represent the general population of
women in Denmark and not a selected subpopulation.
If prescribing physicians are more observant of the onset
of depressive symptoms among patients to whom they have
prescribed hormonal contraceptives, this could imply detec-
tion bias. Nevertheless, such bias likely cannot explain the in-
creasedriskforafirstdepressiondiagnosisatapsychiatrichos-
pital because these diagnoses reflect the more severe
depressive disorders that will be evident regardless of clini-
cal attention. Moreover, if such a detection bias explains the
increased risk, we would expect the risk estimates to be the
sameforalltypesoforalcontraceptivs,whichwasnotthecase.
Further, if such a detection bias was present in our data, we
would expect higher risk estimates for redeemed prescrip-
tions of antidepressants immediately after initiation of hor-
monal contraceptive use. However, the analyses of the dura-
tion of hormonal contraceptive use showed no significant
increase in risk estimates until more than 2 months after ini-
tiation of hormonal contraceptive use.
A potential confounding factor might be the initiation of
a sexual relationship because we speculate that this might

 influence the risk for a first use of antidepressants and the di-
agnosis of depression. We therefore assessed the influence of
sexual activity by restricting analyses to women who mostly
(≥80%) have had their first intercourse (ages 20-30 years).36
Results remained stable. Moreover, 80% of girls aged 11 to 15
years in Denmark used a condom at their first intercourse,37
indicating that sexual relationships for many are likely to start
before initiation of hormonal contraceptive use. Thus, many
adolescents not using hormonal contraceptives are likely also
to be sexually active. Therefore, sexual activity does not seem
to be an important confounder for the association between the
use of hormonal contraceptives and depression.
In a sensitivity analysis we aimed to eliminate the effect
of all fixed confounders over time and attrition of susceptibil-
ity. Risk for antidepressant use 1 year after initiation of hor-
monal contraceptive use (disregarding discontinuation) was
compared with the risk among the same women in the time
before initiation of hormonal contraceptive use with adjust-
ment for age and calendar year. This analysis found that the
increased risk for first use of antidepressants was compa-
rable with that found in the main analyses.
Our data indicate that adolescent girls are more sensitive
than older women to the influence of hormonal contracep-
tive use on the risk for first use of antidepressants or first di-
agnosis of depression. This finding could be influenced by at-
trition of susceptibility, but also that adolescent girls are more
vulnerable to risk factors for depression.38
We must consider that not all depressed individuals are
treated with antidepressants or seen at psychiatric clinics or
hospitals.39Moreover,antidepressantsareprescribedfortreat-
ment of conditions other than depression, although depres-
sion is the main indication (approximately 80%) for the pre-
scription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.40,41
We identified 12 studies23-28,42-47 with emerging conflict-
ing results regarding use of hormonal contraceptives and the
risk for depression (eTable 5 in the Supplement). These stud-
ies are reviewed in the eDiscussion in the Supplement.
Conclusions
Use of hormonal contraceptives was associated with subse-
quent antidepressant use and first diagnosis of depression at
a psychiatric hospital among women living in Denmark. Ado-
lescents seemed more vulnerable to this risk than women 20
to 34 years old. Further studies are warranted to examine de-
pression as a potential adverse effect of hormonal contracep-
tive use.
