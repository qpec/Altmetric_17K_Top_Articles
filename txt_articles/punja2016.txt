Background
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common psychiatric conditions affecting children and adolescents.
Amphetaminesare amongthe mostcommonlyprescribedmedicationstomanage ADHD. There are three mainclassesof amphetamines:
dexamphetamine, lisdexamphetamine and mixed amphetamine salts, which can be further broken down into short- and long-acting
formulations. A systematic review assessing their efficacy and safety in this population has never been conducted.
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of amphetamines for ADHD in children and adolescents.
Search methods
In August 2015 we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, ProQuest Dissertation and Theses, and the Networked
Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, and checked the reference lists of relevant studies and
reviews identified by the searches. No language or date restrictions were applied.
Selection criteria
Parallel-group and cross-over randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing amphetamine derivatives against placebo in a pediatric
population (< 18 years) with ADHD.
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently extracted data on participants, settings, interventions, methodology, and outcomes for each included study.
For continuous outcomes, we calculated the standardized mean difference (SMD) and for dichotomous outcomes we calculated the
risk ratio (RR). Where possible, we conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model. We also performed a meta-analysis of the
most commonly reported adverse events in the primary studies.

 Main results
We included 23 trials (8 parallel-group and 15 cross-over trials), with 2675 children aged three years to 17 years. All studies compared
amphetamines to placebo. Study durations ranged from 14 days to 365 days, with the majority lasting less than six months. Most
studies were conducted in the United States; three studies were conducted across Europe. We judged 11 included studies to be at a high
risk of bias due to insufficient blinding methods, failing to account for dropouts and exclusions from the analysis, and failing to report
on all outcomes defined a priori. We judged the remaining 12 studies to be at unclear risk of bias due to inadequate reporting.
Amphetamines improved total ADHD core symptom severity according to parent ratings (SMD -0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI)
-0.86 to -0.27; 7 studies; 1247 children/adolescents; very low quality evidence), teacher ratings (SMD -0.55; 95% CI -0.83 to -0.27;
5 studies; 745 children/adolescents; low quality evidence), and clinician ratings (SMD -0.84; 95% CI -1.32 to -0.36; 3 studies; 813
children/adolescents; very low quality evidence). In addition, the proportion of responders as rated by the Clinical Global Impression
- Improvement (CGI-I) scale was higher when children were taking amphetamines (RR 3.36; 95% CI 2.48 to 4.55; 9 studies; 2207
children/adolescents; very low quality evidence).
The most commonly reported adverse events included decreased appetite, insomnia/trouble sleeping, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting,
headaches, and anxiety. Amphetamines were associated with a higher proportion of participants experiencing decreased appetite (RR
6.31; 95% CI 2.58 to 15.46; 11 studies; 2467 children/adolescents), insomnia (RR 3.80; 95% CI 2.12 to 6.83; 10 studies; 2429
children/adolescents), and abdominal pain (RR 1.44; 95% CI 1.03 to 2.00; 10 studies; 2155 children/adolescents). In addition, the
proportion of children who experienced at least one adverse event was higher in the amphetamine group (RR 1.30; 95% CI 1.18 to
1.44; 6 studies; 1742 children/adolescents; low quality evidence).
We performed subgroup analyses for amphetamine preparation (dexamphetamine, lisdexamphetamine, mixed amphetamine salts),
amphetamine release formulation (long acting versus short acting), and funding source (industry versus non industry). Between-group
differences were observed for proportion of participants experiencing decreased appetite in both the amphetamine preparation (P <
0.00001) and amphetamine release formulation (P value = 0.008) subgroups, as well as for retention in the amphetamine release
formulation subgroup (P value = 0.03).
Authors’ conclusions
Most of the included studies were at high risk of bias and the overall quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low on most
outcomes. Although amphetamines seem efficacious at reducing the core symptoms of ADHD in the short term, they were associated
with a number of adverse events. This review found no evidence that supports any one amphetamine derivative over another, and does
not reveal any differences between long-acting and short-acting amphetamine preparations. Future trials should be longer in duration
(i.e. more than 12 months), include more psychosocial outcomes (e.g. quality of life and parent stress), and be transparently reported.

Amphetamines for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents
Background
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common problem affecting children and adolescents. ADHD is characterized by
inattention (being easily distracted, unable to focus on one task), impulsivity (fidgety; constantly moving), and hyperactivity (impatient;
acts without thinking). One of the most common treatments for managing ADHD is the drug class of amphetamines, which are a
class of stimulant medications. They are thought to reduce the severity of symptoms associated with ADHD.
Review question
Do children and adolescents (under 18 years of age) diagnosed with ADHD benefit from treatment with amphetamines to reduce the
core symptoms of ADHD, compared to other children and adolescents who receive no drug or a fake drug (placebo)?
Study characteristics
As of August 2015, we identified 23 randomized controlled trials (RCTs: a type of scientific experiment in which people are randomly
assigned to one of two or more treatments), which included 2675 children and adolescents between three years and 17 years of
age. These studies compared amphetamines to placebo. Three different kinds of amphetamines were investigated: dexamphetamine,

 lisdexamphetamine and mixed amphetamine salts. The duration of the included studies ranged from 14 days to 365 days. The RCTs
were conducted in the United States and Europe.
Key results
We found that amphetamines were effective at improving the core symptoms of ADHD in the short term, but that they were also linked
to a higher risk of experiencing adverse events such as sleep problems, decreased appetite, and stomach pain. We found no evidence
that one kind of amphetamine was better than another, and found no difference between amphetamines that act for longer periods of
time versus those that act for shorter periods of time.
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the included studies was low to very low because of problems in their design and large differences between the studies.
Well-designed and clearly reported RCTs that are longer in duration are needed, so we may better understand the long-term effects
(both positive and negative) of amphetamines.

Description of the condition
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the
most common pediatric psychiatric conditions, affecting around
5% of children worldwide (Polanczyk 2007). ADHD is character-
ized by three core symptoms: inattention, impulsivity and hyper-
activity, which are more frequently displayed than would be typical
in children of the same age (APA 2000). The core symptoms are
often presented to various degrees in different children, breaking
ADHD down into three subtypes: the predominantly inattentive
type, the predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type, and the com-
bined type (i.e. children displaying both inattention and hyperac-
tivity) (APA 2000). The condition is often diagnosed at a young
age, usually between the ages of three and six years (NIMH 2009).
The potential for comorbidity is extremely high in this population
and comorbidities are present in almost two-thirds of pediatric
ADHD cases, with the most common being oppositional defiant
disorder (50%), conduct disorder (35%), anxiety disorder (33%),
and depression (33%) (AHRQ 1999; Mayes 2009).
The symptoms of ADHD have been shown to permeate a child’s
performance across multiple settings, having long-term effects on
their academic performance and social development. Studies have
also shown that children with ADHD are more likely to be irri-
table, impatient, and aggressive (NIH 2000). In addition, fami-
lies who have children with ADHD often experience higher lev-
els of parental stress and frustration, marital disruption, and so-
cial isolation (Edwards 1995). It has been estimated that 50% of
childhood ADHD cases will persist into adolescence and adult-
hood (Biederman 1993), making it a chronic lifetime condition
for many.
Description of the intervention
A wide variety of treatments have been used for the manage-
ment of ADHD, including psychosocial interventions, dietary
management, herbal and homeopathic remedies, and biofeed-
back. However, for the past few decades, the psychostimulant,
methylphenidate, has been the first line of treatment (APA 2000),
and has been found to be effective in 70% to 90% of school-
aged children (NIH 2000; Wigal 1999). Amphetamines are the
second most frequently prescribed psychostimulant for pediatric
ADHD, and are becoming an increasingly popular alternative for
children who fail to respond to methylphenidate (Buck 2002).
There are currently three different amphetamine preparations
available, including: dexamphetamine (dextroamphetamine or d-
amphetamine sulfate), which comes in both short-acting and
long-acting formulations; lisdexamphetamine, which is available
as a long-acting formulation (Vyvanase); and mixed amphetamine
salts, which also comes in both short-acting as well as long-acting
preparations (Buck 2002; The Medical Letter 2007).
How the intervention might work
Although the pathophysiology of ADHD is poorly understood,
evidence has suggested that ADHD may be the result of insuf-
ficient production of norepinephrine and dopamine in the pre-
frontal cortex (Arnsten 2006). As such, the executive functions
carried out by the prefrontal cortex are impaired, resulting in for-
getfulness, distractibility, impulsivity, and inappropriate social be-
haviours (Anderson 1999). Others believe that the limbic system
plays a major role in the pathophysiology of ADHD, and it is
thought that hyperactivity and impulsivity result from abnormally
low tonic dopamine activity within this region of the brain (Moore
2011). In either case, as a psychostimulant, amphetamines are
thought to both promote marked neurotransmitter release into
the synaptic cleft as well as disrupt normal reuptake of neurotrans-
mitters, thereby increasing levels of norepinephrine and dopamine
in these regions of the brain and affecting executive function-
ing (Arnsten 2006; Swanson 2007). A Cochrane Review of am-
phetamines for ADHD in adults found they improved short-term
symptom severity (Castells 2011).
Why it is important to do this review
Despite being one of the most thoroughly researched disorders in
medicine, one of the major controversies regarding ADHD is the
use of psychostimulants as a treatment option. While current evi-
dence suggests that amphetamines may be beneficial for improving
the core symptoms of ADHD, their effects on academic and social
domains remain inconsistent and unclear (NIH 2000). Wide vari-
ations in the use and prescription of amphetamines across commu-
nities suggest that there is a lack of consensus among practitioners
regarding which people with ADHD should be treated with am-
phetamines. Charach 2011 and Miller 1999 have conducted re-
views assessing amphetamines for pediatric ADHD; however, the
former focused only on long-term effectiveness of amphetamines
(i.e. > 12 months), while the latter is not only out of date, but
also focused solely on the dexamphetamine preparation. It is im-
perative for healthcare providers, parents, and those diagnosed
with ADHD to be aware of the most suitable treatment options
available, and how they differ in terms of their efficacy and sa-
fety profiles. Our synthesis of all available, randomized controlled
trials assessing the efficacy and safety of amphetamines for pedi-
atric ADHD will provide evidence to better inform clinical prac-
tice and further research relating to ADHD management. While
assessing amphetamines against other ADHD treatments, such
as methylphenidate, psychotherapy and antidepressants is impor-
tant, establishing whether amphetamines are superior to placebo
7

 is a necessary first step. Thus, this review will focus only on the
amphetamine versus placebo comparison.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Parallel-group and cross-over randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
Types of participants
Children and adolescents under 18 years of age and diagnosed
with ADHD using specified diagnostic criteria such as the Di-
agnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Third Edition
(DSM-III) (APA 1987), Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) (APA 2000),
or equivalent (note: since the fifth edition (DSM-5) was released
during the conduct of this review, studies utilizing this criteria are
not included). We included trials that involved children/adoles-
cents with some comorbid conditions (oppositional defiant dis-
order, conduct disorder, and anxiety). We excluded trials whose
inclusion criteria included children/adolescents with psychiatric
comorbidity that require highly specialized treatment programs
(for example, autism, bipolar disorder, and psychosis).
Types of interventions
Intervention
Any oral form of amphetamine (i.e. amphetamine, dexam-
phetamine, lisdexamphetamine and mixed amphetamine salts), at
any dose.
Control
Placebo.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
1. Change in core ADHD symptoms* (inattention,
hyperactivity, impulsivity), as measured by a validated scale rated
by children, parents, teachers, clinicians, or investigators such as
Conners’ Parent Rating Scale - Revised (CPRS-R) (Conners
1998a), Conners’ Teacher Rating Scale - Revised (CTRS-R)

Searching other resources
We inspected the reference lists of identified RCTs and review
articles to identify additional publications.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors (SP and LS) independently screened all ti-
tles and abstracts retrieved from the search to identify those that
appeared to meet the inclusion criteria. The same authors then
obtained the full-text articles of those studies and assessed their
eligibility. Disagreements were resolved by SV.
Data extraction and management
Two review authors (SP and LS) independently extracted data re-
lated to study methods, participant characteristics, and outcomes
by using a pre-designed data collection form. Disagreements were
resolved through discussion. SP entered all relevant data into Re-
view Manager (RevMan 2014).
We emailed study authors up to three times (minimum one month
wait between contact) to obtain missing or unclear data.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Using the Cochrane ’Risk of bias’ tool (Higgins 2011a), two review
authors (SP and LS) independently assessed each included study
as being at low risk, high risk, or unclear (uncertain) risk of bias for
each of the sevendomainsexplainedinAppendix 8. Disagreements
were resolved through discussion.
Measures of treatment effect
Dichotomous outcome data
We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) for dichotomous outcomes.
Continuous outcome data
For continuous outcomes, we used the Hedges’ method to calcu-
late standardized mean differences (SMDs) with individual study
weights calculated as the inverse of the variance, presented with
95% CIs (Hedges 1994). To ensure that all scales were pointing
in the same direction, we multiplied the mean value of one set
by -1 (Deeks 2011). We combined change scores and endpoint
scores, however when both types of scores were available in the
same study, priority was given to change scores since they adjust
for any imbalances in baseline characteristics.
See Table 1 for further methods archived for future updates of this
review.
Unit of analysis issues
Cross-over trials
Since we calculated SMDs for all our continuous outcomes, we
treated cross-over studies as if they were parallel and computed
a pooled standard deviation. Although this method does not ac-
count for the correlation in cross-over studies, it prevented any
overestimation of effect sizes, which is desirable when computing
SMDs. Carry-over was not reported in any of the cross-over stud-
ies.
See Table 1 for further methods archived for future updates of this
review.
Studies with multiple comparisons
For studies with more than two independent comparisons, such as
amphetamine versus placebo versus psychotherapy, we excluded
the psychotherapy arm. We handled studies with multiple and
correlated interventions, for example, lisdexamphetamine ver-
sus mixed amphetamine salts versus placebo, or 10 mg dexam-
phetamine versus 20 mg of dexamphetamine versus placebo in the
following way. For continuous outcomes of parallel-group stud-
ies, we calculated means using the formulae described in Table
7.7.a of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Inter-
ventions (Higgins 2011b). For dichotomous outcomes of parallel-
group studies, we summed the number of events across interven-
tion arms. For continuous outcomes of cross-over studies, we av-
eraged both the means and the standard deviations of the relevant
intervention arms across the groups. For dichotomous outcomes
of cross-over studies, we randomly dropped one arm and used the
other in the meta-analysis.
Studies with multiple time points
We analysed studies separately according to their time frame.
Time frames were denoted as short term (up to six months),
medium term (between six and 12 months), and long term (over
12 months). All but one study (Gillberg 1997) were considered

 short term. Since Gillberg 1997 was the only medium-term study,
it was excluded from the meta-analysis.
See Table 1 for further analyses archived for future updates of this
review.
Dealing with missing data
We emailed study authors up to three times (with at least one
month between contacts) to obtain missing data. For those studies
that did not report outcomes using intention-to-treat analysis and
for which missing data were unobtainable, we used the number
of randomized participants as the denominator for dichotomous
variables. For continuous outcomes, we used the sample size to
calculate the meanandstandarddeviationsinthe study. Forstudies
that did not report standard deviations, we calculated it from P
values, CIs, or standard errors (as described in section 7.7.3.3
of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
(Higgins 2011b)). We did not use any imputations to deal with
missing data.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We assessed statistical heterogeneity by examining the I² statistic
(Higgins 2003), which quantifies the degree of heterogeneity in
a meta-analysis, and Chi² statistic (P value less than 0.10 as evi-
dence of heterogeneity). We also reported Tau² estimates for each
random-effects meta-analysis (Deeks 2011).
We explored heterogeneity by conducting a series of subgroup
analyses (Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity),
which were selected a priori and based on preliminary evidence
from other studies (Castells 2011; Lundh 2012).
Assessment of reporting biases
See Table 1 for methods archived for future updates of this review.
Data synthesis
We synthesized the results in a meta-analysis using the random-
effects model since studies were fairly heterogeneous in terms of
their study design (inclusion of parallel-group and cross-over tri-
als), intervention protocols, and study duration. We used the in-
verse variance method for continuous outcomes, and the Mantel-
Haenszel method for dichotomous outcomes.
Summary of findings
In Summary of findings for the main comparison, we present data
on the following outcomes: total ADHD symptom score - par-
ent ratings, total ADHD symptom score - teacher ratings, total
ADHD symptom score - clinician ratings, proportion of respon-
ders, academic performance, proportion of participants who com-
pleted the trial, and proportion of participants who experienced
at least one adverse event. We presented continuous outcomes as
SMDs and 95% CIs, and dichotomous outcomes as RRs and 95%
CIs. Data regarding number of participants and studies were pre-
sented for each outcome. We used the GRADE (Grades of Recom-
mendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach
(GRADE Working Group 2004) to determine the quality of the
evidence, where evidence was downgraded if (1) the majority (>
50%) of included studies had a high risk of bias; (2) the outcome
included comparisons of different amphetamine derivatives and
release formulations; (3) the outcome had significant statistical
heterogeneity (I² > 50%); and (4) the outcome had wide 95% CIs
indicating that the intervention effect was highly variable.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We conducted the following subgroup analyses.
1. Type of amphetamine: dextroamphetamine,
lisdexamphetamine, or mixed amphetamine salts.
2. Type of amphetamine release formulation: long acting
(extended release) or short acting (immediate release).
3. Funding source: with or without pharmaceutical industry
funding. Since some studies failed to report their funding source,
we grouped studies as ’industry funded’, ’publicly funded’, or
’not reported’.
We conducted subgroup analyses on the following outcomes,
which had a sufficient number of studies (more than five), regard-
less of the degree of statistical heterogeneity present in the main
analysis:
1. total score on core symptom ADHD scale - parent ratings;
2. proportion of responders according to CGI-I (Guy 1976);
3. academic performance;
4. retention: proportion of participants who completed the
trial;
5. proportion of participants who dropped out/withdrew due
to an adverse event;
i) proportion of participants experiencing decreased
appetite;
ii) proportion of participants experiencing insomnia;
iii) proportion of participants experiencing abdominal
pain; and
iv) proportion of participants experiencing headaches.
We calculated a pooled effect size for each subgroup.
We were unable to conduct a subgroup analysis when all of the
studies in a particular meta-analysis belonged to only one strata of
any subgroup.
See Table 1 for further analyses archived for future updates of this
review.
Sensitivity analysis
We repeated our meta-analyses using a fixed-effect model.

Results of the search
Figure 1 summarizes the flow of studies through the screening pro-
cess. The electronic databases retrieved 7011 records while other
sources yielded 198 records. After removing duplicates, we identi-
fied 5210 records for further consideration. After screening titles
and available abstracts, we examined the full texts of 324 records,
34 met our inclusion criteria. From these, we identified 23 stud-
ies, four of which had multiple reports. These were: Borcherding
1990 (four reports), Coghill 2013 (three reports), Donnelly 1989
(two reports; one of which was the pilot, and the other was the full
study), and Ramtvedt 2013 (two reports). In addition, we iden-
tified two ongoing clinical trials (Fanton 2009; NCT01711021);
although recruitment has ended for both of these trials, none of
the results have been published. We contacted the authors of both
studies three times yielding no response. One non-English lan-
guage study is awaiting classification until we can ascertain if it
was randomized and whether participants had a formal diagnosis
of ADHD (Glos 1973). This information is unobtainable given
our inability to contact the author. Another study also awaits clas-
sification as only the abstract has been published (Itil 1974). In-
formation on whether treatments were randomized and whether
participants had a formal diagnosis is needed. We contacted the
authors three times yielding no response.

 Included studies
Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria: 15 studies were
cross-over trials (Barkley 2000; Biederman 2007a; Borcherding
1990; Childress 2015; Donnelly 1989; James 2001; Manos
1999; McCracken 2003; Nemzer 1986; Ramtvedt 2013; Sharp
1999; Shekim 1986; Short 2004; Swanson 1998a; Wigal 2009a),
while eight studies were parallel-group trials (Biederman 2002;
Biederman 2007b; Coghill 2013; Findling 2011; Giblin 2011;
Gillberg 1997; Pliszka 2000; Spencer 2006a).
Ten studies included a single comparison of an amphetamine
derivative versus placebo (Borcherding 1990; Childress 2015;
Coghill 2013; Donnelly 1989; Gillberg 1997; Nemzer 1986;
Pliszka 2000; Ramtvedt 2013; Sharp 1999; Shekim 1986), and 11
studies compared more than one dose of an amphetamine deriva-
tive with placebo (Barkley 2000; Biederman 2002; Biederman
2007b; Findling 2011; Giblin 2011; Manos 1999; McCracken
2003; Short 2004; Spencer 2006a; Swanson 1998a; Wigal 2009a);
two studies compared more than one amphetamine derivative,
each at various doses, versus placebo (Biederman 2007a; James
2001).
Participants
In total, the 23 included studies recruited 2675 children and ado-
lescents aged between three years and 17 years, 72% (n = 1925) of
whom were boys; one study did not report the number of included
boys and girls (Pliszka 2000).
Twenty-two studies used various versions of the DSM criteria
to confirm ADHD diagnosis in their participants, including cri-
teria from the Third Edition (DSM-III; four trials; n = 102;
Borcherding 1990; Donnelly 1989; Nemzer 1986; Shekim 1986);
Third Edition Revised (DSM-III-R; one trial; n = 62; Gillberg
1997); Fourth Edition (DSM-IV; eight trials; n = 899; Barkley
2000; Biederman 2002; James 2001; Manos 1999; McCracken
2003; Sharp 1999; Short 2004; Swanson 1998a), and Fourth
Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR; nine trials; n = 1553;
Biederman 2007a; Biederman 2007b; Childress 2015; Coghill
2013; Findling 2011; Giblin 2011; Ramtvedt 2013; Spencer
2006a; Wigal 2009a). Pliszka 2000 (n = 59) diagnosed ADHD
using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (Costello
1985).
Interventions
Twelve studies assessed mixed amphetamine salts (Barkley 2000;
Biederman 2002; Biederman 2007a; Childress 2015; Gillberg
1997; James 2001; Manos 1999; McCracken 2003; Pliszka 2000;
Short 2004; Spencer 2006a; Swanson 1998a); seven studies used
dextroamphetamine (Borcherding 1990; Donnelly 1989; James
2001; Nemzer 1986; Ramtvedt 2013; Sharp 1999; Shekim 1986);
and six studies looked at lisdexamphetamine (Biederman 2007a;
Biederman 2007b; Coghill 2013; Findling 2011; Giblin 2011;
Wigal 2009a). Two studies assessed two amphetamine derivatives
(Biederman 2007a; James 2001).
Twelve studies randomized children and adolescents to set doses
or dosing schedules (Barkley 2000; Biederman 2002; Biederman
2007b; Coghill 2013; Findling 2011; Giblin 2011; Manos
1999; McCracken 2003; Ramtvedt 2013; Short 2004; Spencer
2006a; Swanson 1998a). Seven studies used weight-based dosing
(Borcherding 1990; Donnelly 1989; James 2001; Nemzer 1986;
Pliszka 2000; Sharp 1999; Shekim 1986), while six studies titrated
children and adolescents to their optimal dose (Biederman 2007a;
Childress 2015; Gillberg 1997; Pliszka 2000; Shekim 1986; Wigal
2009a). Two studies used both weight-based dosing and titration
(Pliszka 2000; Shekim 1986). The mean (range) doses investi-
gated in the included studies were 34.22 mg/day (7.8 mg/day to
90 mg/day) for dextroamphetamine, 50.24 mg/day (30 mg/day
to 70 mg/day) for lisdexamphetamine, and 19.86 mg/day (5 mg/
day to 120 mg/day) for mixed amphetamine salts.
Duration
Study intervention length ranged from 14 days to 365 days, with
a median of 28 days. Only one study was longer than 63 days
(Gillberg 1997).
Location
Twenty studies were conducted in the United States (Barkley
2000; Biederman 2002; Biederman 2007a; Biederman 2007b;
Borcherding 1990; Childress 2015; Donnelly 1989; Findling
2011; Giblin 2011; James 2001; Manos 1999; McCracken 2003;
Nemzer 1986; Pliszka 2000; Sharp 1999; Shekim 1986; Short
2004; Spencer 2006a; Swanson 1998a; Wigal 2009a). One mul-
ticenter trial was conducted in 48 centers across 10 countries:
Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Poland,
Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (Coghill 2013). The two
remaining studies were conducted in Sweden (Gillberg 1997) and
Norway (Ramtvedt 2013).
Outcomes
Details of all ADHD core symptom outcome measures used by
study can be found in the Characteristics of included studies and
Table 2. The most commonly used outcome tool for the primary
outcome included the Conners’ Rating Scales (Conners 1998a;
Conners 1998b) and the ADHD-RS-IV (DuPaul 1998).

 For secondary outcomes, the most commonly utilized outcome
tool for academic performance was the Permanent Product Mea-
sure of Performance (PERMP; Swanson 1998b). Only one study
assessed quality of life (Findling 2011), and used the Youth Quality
of Life - Research Version questionnaire (YQOL-R; Salum 2012)
Excluded studies
We excluded a total of 290 studies. We excluded 264 clearly irrel-
evant reports and formally excluded 26 studies for the following
reasons: 17 studies because they were not RCTs or used multi-
ple cross-over designs (this review only included single cross-over
RCTs); three studies because there was no placebo comparison,
three studies because they did not use formal ADHD diagnostic
criteria; one study because it had no direct amphetamine - placebo
comparison; one study because participants had ineligible comor-
bid conditions; and one study because it included adults.
See also Characteristics of excluded studies tables.
Risk of bias in included studies
A more in depth risk of bias assessment for each study can be
found in Characteristics of included studies. In addition, Figure 2
provides a summary of this assessment.
Figure 2.
Risk of bias graph: review authors’ judgements about each risk of bias item presented as
percentages across all included studies.
Allocation
Random sequence generation
Only three studies reported on how the random sequence was
generated and were assessed as being at ’low’ risk of bias on this
domain (Biederman 2007b; Childress 2015; Findling 2011). We
rated the other 20 studies as ’unclear’ risk of bias as they did not
adequately describe their methods of randomization.
Allocation concealment
Four studies described the methods used to conceal the alloca-
tion sequence and were rated as being at ’low’ risk of bias on this
domain (Biederman 2007a; Coghill 2013; Findling 2011; Manos
1999). The rest of the studies we assessed as ’unclear’ risk of bias,
as they did not sufficiently describe their methods of allocation
concealment.
Blinding
Performance bias
Although blinding was intended in all of the studies, we assessed
risk of bias by how authors described their amphetamine and
placebo capsules and rated 10 studies as being at ’low’ risk of bias
on this domain (Biederman 2007b; Coghill 2013; James 2001;
Manos 1999; Nemzer 1986; Pliszka 2000; Sharp 1999; Short
14
Amphetamines for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 2004; Swanson 1998a; Wigal 2009a). We rated one study as be-
ing at ’high’ risk of bias on this domain since they described their
intervention and placebo as not being identical (Ramtvedt 2013).
The other 12 studies we marked as being at ’unclear’ risk of bias
since they were not explicit about the similarities between the two
interventions.
Detection bias
Only two studies explicitly stated that outcome assessors were
blinded to interventions and therefore we judged them to be at
’low’ risk of bias (Manos 1999; Short 2004). The other 21 studies
we rated as ’unclear’ risk of bias since they were not explicit about
which parties were blinded to the intervention assignment.
Incomplete outcome data
We rated thirteen studies that adequately addressed dropouts and
used appropriate statistical methods to compensate for dropouts
as having a ’low’ risk of bias on this domain (Biederman 2002;
Biederman 2007a; Biederman 2007b; Childress 2015; Donnelly
1989; Findling 2011; Gillberg 1997; James 2001; McCracken
2003; Pliszka 2000; Sharp 1999; Spencer 2006a; Wigal 2009a).
Seven studies failed to provide reasons for dropouts and failed to
address any exclusions from their analyses, and therefore we rated
them as having a ’high’ risk of bias (Barkley 2000; Borcherding
1990; Coghill 2013; Ramtvedt 2013; Shekim 1986; Short 2004;
Swanson 1998a). The three remaining studies did not discuss
dropouts in their reports and we rated them as being at ’unclear’
risk of bias (Giblin 2011; Manos 1999; Nemzer 1986).
Selective reporting
We assessed 17 studies as having ’unclear’ risk of bias on this do-
main as the study protocols for most of them were not available, so
we could not assess reporting bias (Barkley 2000; Biederman 2002;
Biederman 2007b; Borcherding 1990; Donnelly 1989; Giblin
2011; Gillberg1997; James2001; Manos 1999; McCracken 2003;
Nemzer 1986; Pliszka 2000; Sharp 1999; Shekim 1986; Short
2004; Swanson 1998a; Wigal 2009a). We rated four studies as
having a ’low’ risk of bias, as they appropriately reported on all
outcomes defined in their protocols (Biederman 2007a; Childress
2015; Findling 2011; Spencer 2006a). Two studies we assessed
as having a ’high’ risk of bias since they failed to report on all
outcomes mentioned in their registered protocols (Coghill 2013;
Ramtvedt 2013).
Other potential sources of bias
We rated three studies as being at ’unclear’ risk of bias on this
domain since the validity of their primary outcome tools were not
described (Borcherding 1990; Donnelly 1989; Ramtvedt 2013).
The other 20 studies appeared to be free of other potential sources
of bias and therefore we rated them as being at ’low’ risk of bias
on this domain.
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison
We included 19 studies in meta-analyses, however, two of those
studies had measured other outcomes that were relevant to this
review, but were not reported in their results (Borcherding 1990;
Swanson 1998a). Biederman 2007b had reported some of their
results as bar graphs, which, when extracted using graphic digitizer
software, gave implausible results and therefore was excluded from
the meta-analysis on those outcomes. Four studies were excluded
from all meta-analyses: Giblin 2011 had not reported data on any
of the relevant outcomes in this review; Gillberg 1997 was the only
medium-term study and therefore could not be combined with
the other short-term studies; Ramtvedt 2013 had aggregated their
parent- and teacher-rated ADHD scores; and Short 2004 assessed
amphetamines versus methylphenidate versus placebo and pooled
the amphetamine and methylphenidate data in their results; we
were unable to isolate the amphetamine versus placebo compari-
son.
Primary outcome
Change in core ADHD symptoms
We conducted a series of meta-analyses for the primary outcome,
change in core ADHD symptoms (inattention, hyperactivity, im-
pulsivity), as measured by a validated scale rated by children, par-
ents, teachers, clinicians, or investigators (Analysis 1.1 to Analysis
1.11).
For all 11 outcomes, amphetamines were superior to placebo for
reducing the core symptoms of ADHD.
1. Total ADHD symptom score - parent ratings (SMD -0.57;
95% CI -0.86 to -0.27; Tau² = 0.10; I² = 77%; 7 studies; 1247
children/adolescents; Analysis 1.1).
2. Hyperactivity/impulsivity - parent ratings (SMD -0.54;
95% CI -0.89 to -0.19; Tau² = 0.00; I² = 0%; 2 studies; 132
children/adolescents; Analysis 1.2).
3. Total ADHD symptom score - teacher ratings (SMD -0.55;
95% CI -0.83 to -0.27; Tau² = 0.04; I² = 41%; 5 studies; 745
children/adolescents; Analysis 1.3).
4. Hyperactivity/impulsivity - teacher ratings (SMD -1.13;
95% CI -1.63 to -0.62; 1 study; 70 children/adolescents;
Analysis 1.4).
5. Inattention - teacher ratings (SMD -1.43; 95% CI -2.35 to
-0.52; 1 study; 24 children/adolescents; Analysis 1.5).
6. Total ADHD symptom score - clinician ratings (SMD -
0.84; 95% CI -1.32 to -0.36; Tau² = 0.16; I² = 88%; 3 studies;
813 children/adolescents; Analysis 1.6).

 7. Hyperactivity/impulsivity - clinician ratings (SMD -0.75;
95% CI -1.28 to -0.23; Tau² = 0.20; I² = 90%; 3 studies; 813
children/adolescents; Analysis 1.7).
8. Inattention - clinician ratings (SMD -0.78; 95% CI -1.26
to -0.30; Tau² = 0.16; I² = 88%; 3 studies; 813 children/
adolescents; Analysis 1.8).

It is important to note, however, that the majority of these meta-

1.1, Analysis 1.6, Analysis 1.7, Analysis 1.8, Analysis 1.9, and
Analysis 1.11 had considerable heterogeneity present with I² rang-
ing from 77% to 94%. Only three outcomes included more than
three studies: total ADHD symptom score - parent ratings (seven
studies; Analysis 1.1; Figure 3), total ADHD symptom score -
teacher ratings (five studies; Analysis 1.3; Figure 4), and total
ADHD symptom score - investigator/research personnel ratings
(four studies; Analysis 1.11).

 Clinical improvement
The proportion of responders was higher in the amphetamine
group (RR 3.36; 95% CI 2.48 to 4.55; Tau² = 0.14; I² = 72%; 9
studies; 2207 children/adolescents; Analysis 1.12)
Clinical severity
We found evidence of a significant difference between the two
groups on the CGI-S (Guy 1976), in favour of amphetamine
(SMD -0.86; 95% CI -1.72 to -0.01; Tau² = 0.25; I² = 64%; 2
studies; 86 children/adolescents; Analysis 1.13).
Academic performance
We found evidence that amphetamines may improve academic
performance as compared to placebo (SMD 0.56; 95% CI 0.39 to
0.73; Tau² = 0.02; I² = 28%; 8 studies; 826 children/adolescents;
Analysis 1.14).
Quality of life
As shown in the illustrative forest plot, the one study that pro-
vided data on quality of life (Findling 2011), found no difference
between the two groups (SMD -0.01; 95% CI -0.27 to 0.25; 309
children/adolescents; see Analysis 1.15).
Retention
There was no difference between those given amphetamine and
those given placebo for retention (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.10;
Tau² = 0.01; I² = 83%; 11 studies; 2381 children/adolescents;
Analysis 1.16).
Adverse events
Proportion of adverse events
We performed a series of meta-analyses of the most commonly
reported adverse events. A higher proportion of children and ado-
lescents in the amphetamine group as compared to placebo group
experienced decreased appetite (RR 6.31; 95% CI 2.58 to 15.46;
Tau² = 1.59; I² = 85%; 11 studies; 2467 children/adolescents;
Analysis 1.17); insomnia/trouble sleeping (RR 3.80; 95% CI 2.12
to 6.83; Tau² = 0.42; I² = 59%; 10 studies; 2429 children/ado-
lescents; Analysis 1.18); abdominal pain (RR 1.44; 95% CI 1.03
to 2.00; Tau² = 0.04; I² = 13%; 10 studies; 2155 children/ado-
lescents; Analysis 1.19); and nausea/vomiting (RR 1.63; 95% CI
1.04 to 2.56; Tau² = 0.08; I² = 26%; 6 studies; 1579 children/
adolescents; Analysis 1.20). There were no differences between the
amphetamine and placebo groups in the proportion of children
and adolescents who experienced headaches (RR 0.93; 95% CI
0.75 to 1.16; Tau² = 0.00; I² = 0%; 9 studies; 2091 children/ado-
lescents; Analysis 1.21) and anxiety/nervousness (RR 1.22; 95%
CI 0.78 to 1.93; Tau² = 0.09; I² = 32%; 5 studies; 1088 children/
adolescents; Analysis 1.22).
Proportion of participants who experienced at least one
adverse event
The proportion of children and adolescents who experienced at
least one adverse event was higher in the amphetamine group as
compared to the placebo group (RR 1.30; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.44;
Tau² = 0.00; I² = 1%; 6 studies; 1742 children/adolescents; see
Analysis 1.23; Figure 5).

 Proportion of participants who withdrew due to any adverse
event
There was no difference between the amphetamine and placebo
groups in the proportion of children and adolescents who with-
drew due to an adverse event (RR 1.60; 95% CI 0.86 to 2.98; Tau²
= 0.00; I² = 0%; 9 studies; 2160 children/adolescents; Analysis
1.24).
Subgroup analyses
Type of amphetamine
We conducted a series of subgroup analyses according to type of
amphetamine (dexamphetamine, lisdexamphetamine, and mixed
amphetamine salts). Mixed amphetamine salts were associated
with improved parent ratings of total ADHD symptoms as com-
pared to dexamphetamine and lisdexamphetamine, however, there
appeared to be no between-group differences (Chi² = 0.55, P value
= 0.76; Analysis 2.1). Only one subgroup yielded between-group
differences (Chi² = 26.06, P < 0.00001; Analysis 2.6; Figure 6).
There were no between-group differences for any of the other out-
comes.

Type of amphetamine release formulation
We conducted a subgroup analysis to explore the influence of
long-acting versus short-acting amphetamine release formulations
(Analysis 3.1 to Analysis 3.6). Both rentention: proportion of
participants who completed the trial (Chi² = 4.50, P value =
0.03; Analysis 3.4) and proportion of participants experiencing
decreased appetite (Chi² = 6.93, P value = 0.008; Analysis 3.5)
yielded between-group differences.
Funding source
18
Amphetamines for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents (Review)

 We wanted to explore the influence of industry-funded versus
publicly-funded sources (Analysis 4.1 to Analysis 4.3). Since five
studies did not report their source of funding, we introduced
another subgroup, ’not reported’. No between-group differences
were found.
Sensitivity analysis
We repeated the analyses by changing the statistical model from
a random-effects model to a fixed-effect model. The results were
similar (see Analysis 5.1 to Analysis 5.24).

Summary of main results
We included 23 studies in this review, 19 of which we included in
meta-analyses. Overall, this review found that amphetamines were
more efficacious than placebo for reducing ADHD core symp-
tom severity in the short-term, however, they did not influence
retention in the trial and were associated with a number of ad-
verse events. According to conventional cut-offs (Cohen 1988),
the largest effect sizes observed (i.e. an SMD > 0.8) were teacher
ratings of hyperactivity/impulsivity, teacher ratings of inattention,
and clinician ratings of total ADHD symptoms. The meta-analy-
ses with the most available data included parent and teacher ratings
of total ADHD symptoms, both of which yielded low to moderate
effect sizes.
The median study duration was only 28 days, therefore it was
not possible to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of am-
phetamines for pediatric ADHD. This is particularly problematic
in a condition such as ADHD, which may require treatment for
years.
There was a lot of variation in the amphetamine derivatives and
release formulations utilized in the included studies. As such, we
conducted subgroup analyses to explore their differences. Mini-
mal between-group differences were found, however, conclusions
should not be drawn from these analyses as they are based on
observational and not randomized comparisons. Furthermore,
given that the majority of studies assessed mixed amphetamine
salts and long-acting release formulations, the subgroups assessing
other amphetamine derivatives (i.e. lisdexamphetamine, dexam-
phetamine), and short-acting release formulations, may not have
been adequately powered to detect a true difference.
We performed a meta-analysis of the most commonly reported ad-
verse events in the primary studies. These included decreased ap-
petite, insomnia/trouble sleeping, abdominal pain, nausea/vomit-
ing, headaches and anxiety. Meta-analysis revealed that most ad-
verse events occurred more often in the amphetamine groups than
in the placebo groups.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
This review focused only on the amphetamine versus placebo com-
parison. While it is important to assess amphetamines versus other
active therapies, such as other stimulants, psychotherapy or antide-
pressants, we believe it is important to first establish whether or not
amphetamines are superior to placebo. We were unable to assess
the long-term efficacy of amphetamines (i.e. beyond 12 months of
use). The average duration of included studies was five weeks long,
excluding one long-term study that was 12 months long (Gillberg
1997). Short-term trials are particularly problematic for chronic
conditions, such as ADHD, as children will likely be on stimulant
medications for much longer periods than have been studied. As
mentioned earlier, adverse events occurred more frequently when
children and adolescents were treated with amphetamines than
when they were treated with placebo, however, it is important to
point out the poor reporting around adverse events in the included
studies. Some studies only reported on adverse events that were
experienced by a certain percentage of children and adolescents,
thereby potentially ignoring additional adverse events experienced
at less than that fraction. Futhermore, many studies were unclear
regarding their methods of collecting adverse events and whether
they assessed the causality of these adverse events as it related to
the interventions. Heterogeneity of terms used to describe adverse
events was also a major hurdle when conducting this review, and
limited our ability to appropriately synthesize the data. Finally, as
with efficacy data, we were unable to assess the long-term safety
profile of amphetamines given the lack of long-term trials.
Only one study explored the impact of amphetamines on children
and adolescents’ quality of life (Findling 2011). It found no effect,
although this may be because the study was underpowered. This
is a significant gap in the available evidence on the effects of am-
phetamines, and studies should include a focus on psychosocial
factors such as parental stress or quality of life.
The external validity of our results was also limited by the inclu-
sion/exclusion criteria of the included studies. Since we excluded
studies that included children and adolescents with comorbidity
other than conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder and
anxiety, we cannot extrapolate the results of our review to patients
with other commonly occurring comorbidity such as depression,
and tic disorder.
Few trials reported on the ADHD subtype of their included chil-
dren and adolescents. Therefore, we were unable to make any con-
clusions as regards the potential heterogeneity of effect of different
formulations of amphetamines across different ADHD subtypes.
Furthermore, since primary studies did not subgroup their results
according to important prognostic factors, such as age and gender,
we were unable to subgroup our meta-analyses, which would have
been particularly relevant for clinicians.
Although our review did assess the proportion of children and
adolescents who dropped out due to an adverse event and found no
differences between amphetamine and placebo groups (Analysis
19
Amphetamines for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 1.24), it is worth noting that many studies in the meta-analysis had
zero events in the placebo group, resulting in potentially invalid
results that overestimate variance. The high number of zero events
may be attributable to a lack of power to detect these events given
the much smaller sample sizes of the placebo groups (n = 900) as
compared to the amphetamine groups (n = 1532).
Finally, it was difficult for us to accurately assess our results in a
clinically meaningful way, since interpretation of scores is both
sex- and age-dependent.
Quality of the evidence
The overall quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low as
assessed by the GRADE approach, indicating that there is room for
improvement amongst the current evidence about the efficacy of
amphetamines in managing ADHD in children and adolescents.
The studies appear to have a multitude of methodological issues
making it difficult to draw strong clinical conclusions. Moreover,
most studies failed to report on how the random sequence was gen-
erated (90%), how allocation was concealed (85%), the methods
used to blind participants and personnel (55%), and the methods
used to blind outcome assessors (90%). As such, we were unable to
determine whether it was a reporting problem or a methodological
problem.
Potential biases in the review process
Limitations of our review include not being able to account for
correlation in cross-over studies given the formula for calculating
SMDs, thereby yielding less precise effect sizes, which may result
in overlooking any potential statistical heterogeneity between the
studies. Furthermore, caution is warranted in the interpretation
of our meta-analyses of adverse events that contain rare events.
Most methods of meta-analysis, including the chosen Mantel-
Haenszel approach, perform poorly with rare events; they can yield
misleading results, have very wide CIs or the statistical power can
be too low to detect a difference.
Given the small number of studies included in the primary meta-
analyses (maximum of seven studies), we felt that a funnel plot
would not provide meaningful information about potential pub-
lication bias, which may have led to an overestimation of treat-
ment effects.Furthermore, the exclusion of one potentially eligible
non-English study may have also biased our findings. Egger 1997
found that non-English studies tend to be negative, and so exclud-
ing them may have yielded an overestimation of treatment effects.
On the other hand, other researchers have found that excluding
trials reported in languages other than English do not significantly
affect the results of a meta-analysis (Moher 2003).
Another limitation arises from the subgroup comparisons. It must
be noted that these analyses are based on observational and not
randomized comparisons, and therefore should not be interpreted
as conclusive evidence.
Another potential bias of our review is that one of the authors, Dr.
Catherine J Nikles, has published a study on amphetamines for
ADHD; however, two independent authors assessed the eligibility
of this study, which was subsequently excluded due to the nature
of the design (Nikles 2006).
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
We identifiedtwopreviouslyconductedsystematicreviews priorto
conducting ours (Charach 2011; Miller1999). Charach 2011 only
assessed the long-term (i.e. more than 12 months) efficacy and sa-
fety of amphetamines for pediatric ADHD, and included only one
RCT that assessed amphetamines versus placebo, which was also
included in our systematic review (Gillberg 1997). Miller 1999
also systematically assessed amphetamines for pediatric ADHD,
however, reviewers only included studies that assessed the dexam-
phetamine derivative of amphetamines. Furthermore, this review
was published in 1999, making it over 14 years old. As such, Miller
1999 included only three relevant RCTs in their review, which
were also included in this review (Borcherding 1990; Donnelly
1989; Gillberg 1997). The majority of meta-analyses conducted in
the Miller 1999 review included RCTs that assessed any stimulant
medication (methylphenidate or amphetamine) versus placebo.
The one meta-analysis that was restricted to the amphetamine ver-
sus placebo comparison showed that amphetamines improve total
ADHD symptoms as rated by the Abbreviated Conners Teacher
Rating Scale (ATRS; Conners 1990): MD -4.77; 95% CI -6.43 to
-2.99. This is consistent with the results of our review for this out-
come, which also showed improvement in this outcome in favour
of amphetamine (SMD -0.55; 95% CI -0.83 to -0.27).

Implications for practice
Although the resultsof thisreviewdemonstrate thatamphetamines
improve the core symptoms of ADHD in children and adoles-
cents in the short term, they are also associated with higher risk of
experiencing adverse events. Given the lack of available evidence
as regards the effects of amphetamines on ADHD-subtypes, long-
term effectiveness and safety data, and the effects of amphetamines
on psychosocial outcomes, it is difficult to extrapolate the results
from this research to the clinical population. As such, when mak-
ing treatment decisions, clinicians must use their own judgement
in weighing the benefits with the safety profile of the interven-
tion, accounting for the patient’s responsiveness to other stimu-
lant medications (for example, methylphenidate), and integrating

 patient/family preferences and values when making treatment de-
cisions.
This review does not provide evidence that supports any one am-
phetamine derivative over another, and does not reveal any differ-
ences between long-acting and short-acting formulations.
Implications for research
Future RCTs should be longer in duration in order to explore the
long-term safety and efficacy of amphetamines. It would also be
beneficial for future studies to subgroup their results based on im-
portant prognostic factors, such as age and gender, in order to yield
more clinically relevant results. Furthermore, while it has been tra-
ditionally assumed that improvements in core ADHD symptoms
result in improved overall functioning, including academic per-
formance, peer relations and family functioning, there is a lack of
data that supports these correlations. Initiatives such as COMET
(Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials), which aims to
develop standardized sets of research outcomes for various health
conditions, will be pivotal to areas like ADHD in ensuring that
future studies not only focus on symptom management as an out-
come, but also on more global outcomes that focus on a child’s
overall functioning (Williamson 2012).
While there is evidence that shows industry funding has been
associated with exaggerated treatment effects (Lundh 2012), the
debate remains unresolved (Bero 2013; Sterne 2013). Future re-
search should assess to what extent funding source, and author
affiliation with the funding source, impact treatment effects, and
recommendations on whether these factors should be included in
the risk of bias assessment may be helpful.
Researchers should consult the Consolidated Standards of Report-
ing Trials (CONSORT) statement when designing their study and
reporting their methods and results so that an appropriate risk of
bias assessment can be made allowing for a more robust interpre-
tation (Schulz 2010).

*The authors reported their results of parent ratings of hyperactivity/impulsivity and
inattention on the ADHD Rating Scale, Fourth Version, as well as total ADHD symp-
tom scores on the Conners’ Parent Rating Scale - Revised as bar graphs. We sought to
extract relevant data using graphic digitizer software but this gave implausible results.
Consequently, this data could not be included in the meta-analysis

Table 1. Protocol decisions not used in this review
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
Multiple perspectives (i.e. teacher, parent, clinician) are considered the
gold standard when assessing the core symptoms of ADHD. As such, we
will not favor one perspective over another. In the event that reports do
not agree with one another, for example, teacher reports disagree with
parent reports on the improvement of core symptoms, this may be quite
telling about how a child’s environment impacts their ADHD given the
varying demands between a school environment and home environment.
This will be interpreted accordingly in the discussion
Secondary outcomes
We will assess ’parental stress’ as a secondary outcome.
Measures of treatment effect
Dichotomous outcome data
When a single study has utilized more than one measure to assess the
same construct (e.g. ADHD core symptoms as assessed by teacher-rated

(Continued)
ADHD-RS-IV and teacher ratings of the Conners’ ADHD Rating Scale)
, treatment effects will be averaged across outcome measures in order to
arrive at a single treatment effect for use in the meta-analysis
Continuous outcome data
For continuous outcomes, where the same rating scale has been used for
all studies, we will calculate mean differences
Unit of analysis issues
Cross-over trials
For meta-analyses that use that use a mean difference, we will compute
standarddeviationsforthe cross-overtrialstakingintoaccountcorrelation.
If correlation coefficients are not available, we will impute them from
other studies or use 0.5 as a conservative estimate (Follman 1992).
For cross-over trials where carry-over is thought to be a problem, where
no washout period is present, or when only data from the first period are
available, we will analyze data from the first period only
Studies with multiple time points
In studies where results are presented for several periods of follow-up, we
will analyze each outcome at each point in a separate meta-analysis with
other comparable studies taking measures at a similar time frame post-
randomization. Time frames will reflect short-term (up to six months),
medium-term (between 6 months and 12
months), and long-term (over 12 months) outcomes.
Assessment of reporting biases
For each primary meta-analysis in which we have identified a sufficient
number of studies (n ≥ 10) for inclusion, we will draw funnel plots in
order to assess the possibility of publication bias
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We will conduct the following subgroup analyses.
1. Presence of comorbidities (i.e. oppositional defiant disorder,
conduct disorder, or both) versus no comorbid conditions.
2. ADHD subtype: inattentive type versus hyperactive-impulsive type
versus combined type
Sensitivity analysis
We will conduct the following sensitivity analyses.
1. Based on the risk of bias assessment of the studies: we will restrict
each outcome meta-analysis to those studies with a low risk of bias. A
study is defined as having a low risk of bias if all domains of the risk of
bias tool score a low risk of bias.
2. Based on publication status: unpublished versus published studies.
3. Missing data: we will conduct a sensitivity analysis of the imputed
standard deviation versus a lower imputed standard deviation.

Please refer to Table 1 for a summary of protocol decisions not used in this review.
Methods. Data collection and analysis. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies.
In our protocol, we had included funding source in the risk of bias assessment. However, given the ongoing debate of the influence of
funding source on treatment effect estimates, we removed this from the assessment. Instead, we explored the influence of industry on
treatment effects by performing a subgroup analysis on funding source (industry versus publicly funded versus not reported).
Methods. Data collection and analysis. Unit of analysis issues.
Studies with multiple comparisons
For dichotomous outcomes of cross-over studies, we randomly dropped one arm and used the other in the meta-analysis.
Methods. Data collection and analysis. Assessment of heterogeneity
We added that we assessed statistical heterogeneity by examining “Chi² (P value less than 0.10 as evidence of heterogeneity)”, and
“Tau² estimates for each random-effects meta-analysis”.

 Methods. Data collection and analysis. ’Summary of findings’.
We added a description of what was included in the ’Summary of findings’ table beneath the subsection on ’Data synthesis’.
Methods. Data collection and analysis. Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity.
We had planned to perform a subgroup analysis based on type of questionnaire used (teacher, parent, clinician, investigator). However,
given the importance of each of these informants individually in the overall assessment of ADHD, these were separated in our primary
analysis.
Methods. Data collection and analysis. Sensitivity analysis.
We did not conduct a sensitivity analysis according to study design (parallel-group versus cross-over trial) as planned, since all included
cross-over studies were treated as if they were parallel-group studies.
