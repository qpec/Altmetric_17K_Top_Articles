IMPORTANCE Recognition that adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is
common, seriously impairing, and usually undiagnosed has led to the development of adult
ADHD screening scales for use in community, workplace, and primary care settings. However,
these scales are all calibrated to DSM-IV criteria, which are narrower than the recently
developed DSM-5 criteria.
OBJECTIVES To update for DSM-5 criteria and improve the operating characteristics of the
widely used World Health Organization Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) for screening.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Probability subsamples of participants in 2 general
population surveys (2001-2003 household survey [n = 119] and 2004-2005 managed care
subscriber survey [n = 218]) who completed the full 29-question self-report ASRS, with both
subsamples over-sampling ASRS-screened positives, were blindly administered a
semistructured research diagnostic interview for DSM-5 adult ADHD. In 2016, the
Risk-Calibrated Supersparse Linear Integer Model, a novel machine-learning algorithm
designed to create screening scales with optimal integer weights and limited numbers of
screening questions, was applied to the pooled data to create a DSM-5 version of the ASRS
screening scale. The accuracy of the new scale was then confirmed in an independent
2011-2012 clinical sample of patients seeking evaluation at the New York University Langone
Medical Center Adult ADHD Program (NYU Langone) and 2015-2016 primary care controls
(n = 300). Data analysis was conducted from April 4, 2016, to September 22, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), and
positive predictive value (PPV) of the revised ASRS.
RESULTS Of the total 637 participants, 44 (37.0%) household survey respondents, 51 (23.4%)
managed care respondents, and 173 (57.7%) NYU Langone respondents met DSM-5 criteria
for adult ADHD in the semistructured diagnostic interview. Of the respondents who met
DSM-5 criteria for adult ADHD, 123 were male (45.9%); mean (SD) age was 33.1 (11.4) years.
A 6-question screening scale was found to be optimal in distinguishing cases from noncases
in the first 2 samples. Operating characteristics were excellent at the diagnostic threshold
in the weighted (to the 8.2% DSM-5/Adult ADHD Clinical Diagnostic Scale population
prevalence) data (sensitivity, 91.4%; specificity, 96.0%; AUC, 0.94; PPV, 67.3%). Operating
characteristics were similar despite a much higher prevalence (57.7%) when the scale was
applied to the NYU Langone clinical sample (sensitivity, 91.9%; specificity, 74.0%; AUC, 0.83;
PPV, 82.8%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The new ADHD screening scale is short, easily scored, detects
the vast majority of general population cases at a threshold that also has high specificity and
PPV, and could be used as a screening tool in specialty treatment settings.

 A
ttention-deficit/hyperactivitydisorder(ADHD)isacom-
monly occurring childhood-onset disorder often per-
sisting into adulthood.1 Adult ADHD is associated with
a high prevalence of secondary comorbid mental disorders,2
work impairment,3 accidents with injuries,4 and early
mortality,5 but is typically undetected and untreated6 de-
spite evidence of treatment effectiveness.7 Accordingly, there
is interest in screening for adult ADHD in primary care8 and
workplace settings.9 However, published versions of existing
screening scales are still calibrated to DSM-IV criteria.10 Preva-
lence should increase using DSM-5 criteria given the reduced
number of required symptoms and later required age of on-
set. We present a new version of the widely used Adult ADHD
Self-Report Screening Scale (ASRS)11,12 updated for DSM-5 cri-
teria based on analyses in a national household survey, a sur-
vey of managed care subscribers, and a specialty clinical
sample.
Methods
Samples
National Comorbidity Survey Replication
The household sample came from the National Comorbidity
Survey Replication (NCS-R), a national face-to-face survey per-
formed from February 5, 2001, to April 7, 2003.13 Childhood
ADHD was assessed retrospectively among respondents aged
18to44years.Respondentsweredividedinto4samplingstrata
for an ASRS clinical reappraisal follow-up telephone survey,
those denying any childhood symptoms, those with child-
hood symptoms not meeting full criteria, those with child-
hood ADHD denying current symptoms, and those with
childhoodADHDandcurrentsymptoms.The29-questionASRS
and a blinded, semistructured diagnostic interview (both de-
scribed below) were administered to quota samples in each
stratuminafollow-uptelephonesurvey.Interviewsweretape-
recorded for quality control. Each respondent received $25 for
participation. Verbal informed consent was obtained before in-
terviews. These recruitment and consent procedures were ap-
proved by the human subjects committees of the University
of Michigan and Harvard Medical School. The 119 completed
clinical reappraisal interviews were weighted to adjust for
differential sampling across strata. More details about study
design are reported elsewhere.11
Managed Care Sample
The managed care sample was based on a 2004-2005 tele-
phone survey of subscribers to a large managed health care
plan14 that included the DSM-IV ASRS screening scale.12 A sub-
sample of respondents, with oversampling of screened posi-
tives, was reinterviewed 6 months later. The full ASRS, fol-
lowed by the same semistructured diagnostic interview as in
the NCS-R, was then administered to a subsample of 218-
second-survey respondents, with oversampling of stably
screened positives. Recruitment and informed consent pro-
cedureswerethesameasintheNCS-Randwereapprovedwith
a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act waiver
by the institutional review board of New York University (NYU)
Langone School of Medicine. The completed interviews were
weighted to adjust for oversampling. More details about study
design are reported elsewhere.12
NYU Langone Sample
The2014-2015clinicalsampleincluded300patientswhowere

gram at NYU Langone based on mass media recruitment and
referrals(n = 193),assessedbetweenJanuary26,2011,andSep-
tember 7, 2012, or were controls from primary care waiting
rooms near the NYU Langone campus (n = 107), assessed be-
tween September 16, 2015, and February 26, 2016. The full
ASRS tool and same blinded, semistructured diagnostic inter-
view as in the NCS-R and managed care samples were admin-
istered either face-to-face (patients seen at the ADHD pro-
gram) or by telephone (patients recruited in primary care
waitingrooms).Incentivesforparticipationwerethefreeevalu-
ation to those recruited for evaluation and a $25 incentive to
those recruited in primary care waiting rooms. Written in-
formed consent was obtained before the interviews were ad-
ministered. Recruitment and consent procedures were ap-
proved and a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
ActwaiverwasgrantedbytheinstitutionalreviewboardofNYU
Langone School of Medicine.
The ASRS Screening Scale Item Pool
The ASRS screening scale was developed by 2 board-certified
psychiatrists (L.A.A. and T.J.S.) working with a World Health
Organization (WHO) advisory group to generate 1 fully struc-
tured question for each DSM-IV Criterion A1-A2 symptom of
inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity plus 11 non–
DSM-IV symptoms of deficits in higher-level executive func-
tion believed to be relevant to adult ADHD.15 Many of the lat-
ter items were similar to the Utah Criteria for adult ADHD.16
Eachquestionaskedhowoftenthesymptomoccurredoverthe
past 6 months with responses of never, rarely, sometimes, of-
ten, and very often.
The Clinical Interview
Clinical diagnoses of DSM-5 adult ADHD were made based on
semistructured interviews using version 1.2 of the Adult ADHD
Key Points
Question Can a brief screening scale based on patient responses
to structured questions detect DSM-5 adult attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder in the general population?
Findings A new machine-learning algorithm was used to build a
screening scale from responses to 6 questions in the World Health
Organization Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
Self-Report Scale using optimal integer scoring rules. The scale had
excellent cross-validated concordance with blinded clinical
diagnoses of DSM-5 adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
Meaning The new scale is short, easily scored, and can detect the
vast majority of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
cases in the general population with high sensitivity and
specificity, discriminating well among patients presenting for
evaluation and specialty treatment.

 Clinical Diagnostic Scale (ACDS),17,18 a widely used research di-
agnostic interview.10 The interview began with a retrospec-
tive assessment of childhood ADHD and then assessed recent
(past 6 months) symptoms. Both childhood- and adult-
specific prompts were used to ensure adequate exploration of
symptom severity and breadth. The DSM-5 and ACDS diagno-
ses required 6 to 9 childhood and 5 to 9 current adult DSM-5
A1 or A2 symptoms (DSM-5 Criterion A), at least 1 symptom
prior to age 12 (Criterion B), some ADHD-related impairment
in 2 or more domains of functioning in the past 6 months (Cri-
terion C), and clinically significant ADHD-related impair-
ment over the same time period (Criterion D). Criterion E
(symptoms do not occur exclusively during the course of a per-
vasive developmental disorder or psychotic disorder and are
notbetteraccountedforbyanothermentaldisorder)wasevalu-
ated indirectly by asking clinical interviewers to probe to con-
firm that symptoms were not due to anxiety, mood, or sub-
stance disorders, but comorbid disorders were not explicitly
assessed. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder not other-
wise specified was not indicated as a diagnosis. The DSM-5 re-
quirement of impairment before age 12 years was not opera-
tionalized.
The ACDS was administered in the NCS-R by 4 experi-
enced PhD-level clinical interviewers who received 40 hours
of training from 2 board certified psychiatrists specializing in
adult ADHD research (L.A.A. and T.J.S.). Each interviewer had
tocomplete5practiceinterviewswithsymptomratingsmatch-

tigators (T.J.S.). The ACDS interviews in the NYU Langone
sample were administered by 2 clinical psychology trainees (a

meetingsandofhavingthesupervisorreview100%ofthetapes
and refer all discrepancies with interviewer ratings to the psy-
chiatrists (L.A.A. and T.J.S.) for discussion and resolution.
Developing the New Screening Scale
Analysis of deidentified data was approved by the institu-
tional review board of NYU Langone School of Medicine and
was carried out in 2016. We aimed to create a DSM-5 ASRS
screening scale with the same form as its DSM-IV counter-
part: that is, a simple additive scale with a limited number of
variables and integer scoring (ie, each response option a whole
numberintherangeof0-5)forquickcalculation.Becausethere
isnostandardmethodologytocreatesuchscales,existingtools
are built manually by combining restricted and/or stepwise lo-
gistic regression with ad hoc rounding.11 However, a new ma-
chine-learning algorithm, RiskSLIM (Risk-Calibrated Super-
sparse Linear Integer Model),19 a risk-calibrated version of the
SLIM20 algorithm, now makes it possible to develop short in-
teger-scored screening scales more rigorously by using mod-
ern optimization techniques that find a best-fitting logistic re-
gressionmodelwithafixednumberofscreeningquestionsand
optimalintegerscoringofeachresponseoptiontopredictclini-
cal outcomes.
RiskSLIM models were estimated by creating 4 nested di-
chotomous predictors for each ASRS question (eg, 1 for a re-
sponse of never, 1 for responses of rarely or more, 1 for re-
sponsesofsometimesormore)andestimatingaseparatemodel
constrained to use no more than 8 questions (and as many
nested dichotomies within questions as useful) constraining
signs of coefficients for the never dichotomies to be negative
and for the remaining responses to be positive. The specific
questions were selected to minimize logistic loss + C0 ×
(number of nonzero coefficients), where Co is a regulariza-
tion parameter. The number of questions was chosen to opti-
mize 10-fold cross-validated (10-CV) area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (area under the curve [AUC]; the
proportionoftimesarandomlyselectedcasewillhaveahigher
screening scale score than a randomly selected noncase)21 and
calibration accuracy (CAL) (square root of weighted mean
squared error between predicted and observed ADHD preva-
lence across all scores on the screening scale).22
We report 10-CV estimates of operating characteristics to
evaluate likely out-of-sample performance. Because SEs are
downwardly biased when model selection is based on regu-
larization,weplottedminimumandmaximumsof10-CVAUCs
to evaluate precision. To ensure that the final screening scale
was appropriate for use in general population samples and was
based on enough cases with clinical diagnoses to have an ac-
ceptable event-per-variable ratio for up to 8 screening
questions,23 we pooled NCS-R and managed care samples for
estimation. Since both samples included extreme weights that
may influence variation in 10-CV estimates, we transformed
thedatabeforeanalysisbydividingtheoriginalweightsineach
sample, which summed to the observed sample size, by the
smallestweight,roundingeachtransformedweighttothenear-
est whole number and duplicating records for each respon-
dent the number of times equal to the respondent’
s rounded
weight. Once the best model was selected, coefficients were
appliedtoboththegeneralpopulationandclinicalsamplesand
individual-level predicted probabilities were compared with
clinical diagnoses to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value (PPV), and AUC.
Results
Prevalence of DSM-5/ACDS Adult ADHD
The weighted (to adjust for oversampling) prevalence of DSM-
5/ACDS adult ADHD was 6.5% in the NCS-R sample, 9.2% in
the managed care sample, and 8.2% in the pooled combina-
tion of the 2 samples. The unweighted prevalence was 37.0%
in the NCS-R sample (n = 44 of DSM-5/ACDS cases), 23.4% in

 the managed care sample (n = 51), and 57.7% in the NYU Lan-
gone sample (n = 173). Of the respondents who met DSM-5
criteria for adult ADHD, 123 were male (45.9%); mean (SD) age
was 33.1 (11.4) years.
Choosing the Optimal Number
of Screening Questions
Inspection of 10-CV AUC showed a monotonic increase as the
number of questions increased, from approximately 0.82 for
a model with 1 question to more than 0.95 for models with 3
to 8 questions and more modest increases after 3 questions
(Figure 1). The likelihood of good out-of-sample performance
is indicated by a narrow AUC range across 10-CV replicates. In
contrast,inspectionof10-CVCALshowedanonmonotonicpat-
tern, with the highest CAL in the degenerate case of the model
with only 1 screening question (degenerate in that the vast ma-
jority of the respondents did not have the disorder and model
fitwasdrivenbyclassifyingthe91.8%oftruenoncasesassuch),
decreasing CAL in models with 2 to 4 screening questions and
increasing CAL in models with 5 to 6 screening questions
(Figure 2). Based on these results, we focused on the 6-ques-
tion model because it achieved best-in-class AUC and CAL. A
3-question model was a close competitor but lacked the granu-
larity near the clinical threshold that further analysis (re-
ported below) found for the 6-question model.
The questions in the final scale include (1) DSM-5 symp-
tom of inattention (Criterion A1c: does not listen when spo-
ken to directly), (2) non–DSM-5 symptoms of executive dys-
function (puts things off to last minute, depends on others to
keep life in order), and (3) DSM-5 symptoms of hyperactivity
andimpulsivity(CriterionA2b,leavesseatinappropriately;Cri-
terion A2d, difficulty playing quietly/leisure time; Criterion
A2g, blurts out answers) (Table 1). A 0 score is assigned to all
never responses, but scores for higher responses vary, with the
possible range of 0 to 24. As noted above, scores are weakly
monotonic within questions by construction but vary within
and across questions in other ways, reflecting differing asso-
ciationswithclinicaldiagnoses.Totalscreeningscoressummed
across all responses have a 0 to 24 range.
Operating Characteristics of the New Screening Scale
The optimal threshold for maximizing the AUC in the pooled
NCS-Randmanagedcaresampleswas14orhigher(AUC,0.94),
which screened 11.2% of respondents and captured 91.4% of
DSM-5/ACDS cases (sensitivity), with false-positive rates
(1 − specificity) of 4.0% and 67.3%, respectively, of screened
positivesbeingDSM-5/ACDScases(PPV)ofADHD(Table2).Per-
formance was substantially worse when the operating thresh-
old was lowered to 13 or higher, which resulted in a small in-
crease in sensitivity (92.6%) at the expense of a major
overestimation of prevalence (21.8%), yielding substantially
worse PPV (34.9%). These results suggest that the 14 or higher
operating threshold would most likely be preferred for screen-
ing purposes.
Screening scale performance was investigated separately
in the NYU Langone sample. The optimal threshold of 14 or
higherinthegeneralpopulationsamplecaptured91.9%ofNYU
Langone DSM-5/ACDS cases. The false-positive rate at that
threshold(26.0%)wasconsiderablyhigherthanthatinthegen-
eral population sample, the AUC (0.829) was lower, and the
PPV was high (82.8%). As in the general population sample,

Comparing the DSM-IV and DSM-5 ASRS Screening Scales
GiventhestrongcorrelationsbetweenresponsestoASRSques-
tions,itispossiblethatresponsestothe6questionsintheorigi-
nal DSM-IV/ACDS screening scale11,12 could discriminate be-
tween DSM-5/ACDS cases and noncases with good accuracy.
If so, this would be useful for researchers who have already col-
lected data using the DSM-IV ASRS screening scale. To inves-
tigate this possibility, we applied RiskSLIM to build a screen-
ing scale using only the responses to the 6 questions in the
original DSM-IV/ACDS screening scale and assessed the oper-
atingcharacteristicsofthisupdatedDSM-IV/ACDSscaleforpre-
dicting DSM-5 adult ADHD by optimizing response option
scores (Table 3). The results showed that this updated DSM-IV
scale underperforms relative to the DSM-5 version but still de-
tectsmostDSM-5cases(sensitivity,84.2%inthegeneralpopu-
lation samples and 79.8% in the NYU Langone sample) at a
threshold with a relatively low false-positive rate (1 − speci-
ficity, 10.5% in the general population sample and 10.2% in the
NYU Langone sample), but at the expense of a highly up-
wardly biased prevalence estimate.
Discussion
The new DSM-5 ASRS screening scale showed excellent oper-
ating characteristics, given that it correctly classified nearly all
people who met diagnostic criteria for ADHD in clinical inter-
views both in the general population (where prevalence was
low and cases were often mild) and in a specialty treatment
setting (where prevalence was high and cases were often se-
vere). In particular, 67.3% of screened positives in the general
population and more than 80% in the specialty treatment
sample were confirmed as having the disorder at a threshold
that had sensitivity above 90% and yielded few false-
positiveresults.Thesegoodoperatingcharacteristicsmeanthat
the ASRS scale could be used as a practical screen for DSM-5
adult ADHD despite a number of the screening scale ques-
tions not being DSM-5 symptoms, since the scale captures
nearly all DSM-5 cases above the screening threshold with high
enough PPV that a full clinical assessment of DSM-5 criteria
could be carried out in screened positives to distinguish indi-
viduals with ADHD from those without ADHD requiring the
evaluation of many of those without the disorder.
Limitations
The analysis was limited by the general population training
samples being relatively small and restricted either to people

healthplan.Eventhoughthestrongcross-validatedresultsand
good performance in an independent clinical sample reduce
concerns about these limitations, it would be useful to vali-
date the screening scale in other samples, such as primary care
and workplace case-finding samples and subsamples of pa-
tients with presenting symptoms consistent with adult ADHD.
Another limitation is that the clinical interviews did not in-
clude informant reports, which improve detection of individu-
als with ADHD who lack insight into their conditions.24 Our
screening scale should consequently be considered optimal
only for people with sufficient insight to recognize their symp-
toms, although even specialty treatment centers typically base
diagnoses on patient reports rather than also requiring infor-
mant reports. An additional limitation is that clinical stan-
dard interviews did not evaluate important exclusionary co-
morbid diagnoses (eg, bipolar disorder). Another limitation is
that, although the ACDS scale has been used previously in both
academic research and US Food and Drug Administration reg-
istration trials for ADHD medications, no formal reliability and
validity studies have been performed. Although having such
studies would be ideal, it is unlikely that low reliability or va-
lidity would have led to the findings reported in this and other
studies using the ACDS scale.
Conclusions
We found that a new machine-learning algorithm was able to
build a screening scale for DSM-5 adult ADHD from responses
to 6 questions in the WHO ASRS screening scale using opti-
malintegerscoringrulesthathadexcellentcross-validatedcon-
cordance with blinded clinical diagnoses both in the general
population and among individuals seeking help. The new scale
isshort,easilyscored,candetectnearlyallofadultADHDcases
in the general population with high sensitivity and specific-
ity, and also discriminates well among patients presenting for
evaluation and specialty treatment.

Funding/Support: The Adult Attention-Deficit/
Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report (ASRS) scale was
developed in collaboration with the World Health
Organization (WHO) World Mental Health (WMH)
Survey Initiative in conjunction with the revision of
the WHO Composite International Diagnostic
Interview (CIDI)25 with support from Eli Lilly and
Company. The ASRS Screener cross-validation
study was supported by Eli Lilly and Company and
HealthCore Inc. The larger series of WMH
methodological studies in which the ASRS
development work was embedded were also
supported National Institute of Mental Health grant
R01 MH070884; the John D. and Catherine T.
MacArthur Foundation; the Pfizer Foundation;
US Public Health Service grants R13-MH066849,
R01-MH069864, and R01 DA016558; the Fogarty
International Center grant R01-TW006481; the Pan
American Health Organization; Eli Lilly and
Company; Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical Inc;
GlaxoSmithKline; and Bristol-Myers Squibb. The
DSM-IV ASRS Screening Scale was developed with
support from an unrestricted educational grant
from the Eli Lilly Company. The DSM-5 ASRS
Screening Scale was developed with support from
Shire Pharmaceuticals.
