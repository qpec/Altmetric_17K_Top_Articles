Abstract
Background
Rigorous evidence of the effectiveness of male engagement interventions, particularly on
how these interventions impact relationship power dynamics and women’s decision-making,
remains limited. This study assessed the impact of the Bandebereho gender-transformative
couples’ intervention on impact on multiple behavioral and health-related outcomes influ-
enced by gender norms and power relations.
Methods
We conducted a multi-site randomised controlled trial in four Rwandan districts with expec-
tant/current fathers and their partners, who were randomised to the intervention (n = 575
couples) or control group (n = 624 couples). Primary outcomes include women’s experience
of physical and sexual IPV, women’s attendance and men’s accompaniment at ANC, mod-
ern contraceptive use, and partner support during pregnancy. At 21-months post-baseline,
1123 men and 1162 partners were included in intention to treat analysis. Generalized esti-
mating equations with robust standard errors were used to fit the models.
Findings
The Bandebereho intervention led to substantial improvements in multiple reported out-
comes. Compared to the control group, women in the intervention group reported: less past-

dance (IRR 1.09, p<0.001) and male accompaniment at antenatal care (IRR 1.50, p<0.001);
and women and men in the intervention group reported: less child physical punishment
(women: OR 0.56, p = 0.001; men: OR 0.66, p = 0.005); greater modern contraceptive use
(women: OR 1.53, p = 0.004; men: OR 1.65, p = 0.001); higher levels of men’s participation
in childcare and household tasks (women: beta 0.39, p<0.001; men: beta 0.33, p<0.001);
and less dominance of men in decision-making.
Conclusions
Our study strengthens the existing evidence on male engagement approaches; together
with earlier studies our findings suggest that culturally adapted gender-transformative inter-
ventions with men and couples can be effective at changing deeply entrenched gender
inequalities and a range of health-related behavioral outcomes.

Introduction
Interest and investment in interventions engaging men in reproductive and maternal health
and violence prevention in low- and middle-income countries has grown tremendously since
the 1990s [1]. Male engagement interventions have evolved from seeking to involve men to
overcome specific barriers, such as women’s limited decision-making power or access to health
care, to be increasingly gender-transformative, engaging men and their partners to challenge
the inequitable gender and power dynamics that give rise to such barriers [2,3]. However, rigor-
ous evidence of the effectiveness of such interventions, particularly from low- and middle-
income countries (LMIC), remains limited [3–5]. In addition, there is a need to measure how
these interventions impact relationship power dynamics and women’s decision-making, to
ensure male engagement approaches do not undermine women’s autonomy [3]. We undertook
a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Rwanda to assess the effectiveness of the Bandebereho
(meaning “role model” in Kinyarwanda) couples’ intervention, a gender-transformative pro-
gram for men and couples to promote men’s engagement in reproductive and maternal health,
caregiving, and healthier couple relations. This study evaluates the intervention’s impact on
multiple behavioral and health-related outcomes influenced by gender norms and power rela-
tions, which were addressed by the intervention.
Male engagement approaches in LMIC assessed by RCTs, whether targeting men alone or
together with women, have ranged widely in scope, from those distributing information to
intensive 50-hour participatory interventions, and in the degree to which they emphasize gen-
der inequalities and power dynamics. Several trials have shown positive impacts on outcomes
related to intimate partner violence (IPV) [6–10], family planning [8,11], and maternal health
[12–14]. However, few studies have evaluated interventions addressing multiple outcomes,
and fewer still have examined impact on household gender and power dynamics, such as on
equitable decision-making [15] and men’s participation in household tasks [10,15].
Rwanda represents a strategic place to evaluate a gender-transformative male engagement
approach. The country has made significant strides in maternal health by ensuring that nearly

 all women attend at least one antenatal care visit (99%) and deliver in a health facility (91%)
[16]. The maternal mortality ratio fell from 476 per 100,000 live births in 2010 to 210 in 2015
[16]. However, 19% of married women still report an unmet need for family planning [16].
Women with limited household decision-making power are less likely to use contraceptives,
and only 23% of Rwandan women are the primary decision-makers about their own health
care [16]. Intimate partner violence (IPV) is also high: nationally, more than 20% of married
women report having experienced physical or sexual violence from a partner in the past year
[16]. Accordingly, the Government of Rwanda recognizes that further progress on reproduc-
tive and maternal health requires interventions with men and couples to promote equitable
gender relations, women’s decision-making power, and reduced IPV [17].
Methods
We conducted a two-arm multi-site randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of the
Bandebereho couples’ intervention on our outcomes of interest. Couples were recruited from
local communities in Karongi, Musanze, Nyaruguru and Rwamagana districts in Rwanda
from February 19 to March 17, 2015, and followed over a period of 21 months for this study.
Men were interviewed at three time points: baseline, 9 months post-baseline, and 21 months
post-baseline; due to funding constraints, women were interviewed at only two time-points, at
9 and 21 months post-baseline. In order to highlight the longer-term effects of the interven-
tion, this paper presents the findings from 21 months post-baseline. The Rwanda Men’s
Resource Center, a local non-governmental organization implementing the intervention,
selected the sites in collaboration with district authorities.
Participants
For the study, a total of 1199 men were recruited from 48 pre-selected sites within 16 sectors
(sub-district administrative units) in the districts selected for the intervention. Couples’ inclu-
sion in the study was determined by men’s eligibility for the intervention. Eligible men were
aged 21–35 years, married or cohabitating, expectant and/or fathers of children under-five
years (based on self-reports), living within accessible distance of the meeting site, and were not
previous Bandebereho intervention participants. The legal age of marriage (21 years) in
Rwanda served as the minimum age for participation. Community volunteers facilitating the
intervention worked with local community health workers to identify 25 eligible men in each
of the 48 sites.
Sample size determination.
We conducted a power analysis prior to study recruitment,
in June 2014, to assess ability to detect intervention effects on selected outcomes. We calcu-
lated power for outcomes similar to those we planned to measure, including perpetration of
IPV, communication about family planning, and gender attitudes, using estimates from the
2010 Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey [18] and the 2010 International Men and Gen-
der Equality Survey [19], assuming an intervention sample size of 576 couples (48 groups with
12 couples each). We conservatively calculated power for a 5–10% difference in these out-
comes, using a two-sided test of equality of two proportions with adjustment made for design
effects due to clustering, assuming an intra-class correlation coefficient of less than 0.1 and an
alpha of 0.05. We found that the indicators would provide enough power (between 65% and
99%, depending on the indicator).
Randomization and masking.
Randomization to either the intervention or control group
was done after baseline interviews using the individual as the unit of randomization. In each of
the 48 sites, 12 men were randomly assigned to the intervention arm (n = 575), and the
remaining men were assigned to the control arm (n = 624). Laterite, an independent firm

 collecting the data, randomized the participants using a random number generator in Stata 12.
Bandebereho community facilitators notified men of their assignment. All recruited men
remained eligible for randomization to the intervention regardless of participation in baseline
data collection: in total, 1199 men out of a possible 1200 were invited to participate in the
study, and 1195 men were surveyed at baseline. After randomization, we discovered two facili-
tators from neighbouring sites had mistakenly recruited the same participant, who was ran-
domized twice into the intervention, resulting in 575 men randomized to the intervention, out
of a possible 576.
Due to the nature of the intervention, it was not possible to mask group assignments for
participants. Group assignment was also not masked for the data collectors, who were not
involved in the intervention. Specific measures to track spillover effects were included in the
study design because the intervention and control groups reside in the same communities, and
the intervention promotes community outreach. However, we posited that the effects of partic-
ipation in the intensive intervention would outweigh any spillover effects and that such effects
would result in underestimation, rather than over-estimation, of the intervention’s impact.
Procedure
Structured questionnaires were administered to male participants at baseline from 19 February
to 17 March 2015. As noted above, men’s partners were not surveyed at baseline due to fund-
ing constraints. After the baseline and randomization, the Bandebereho intervention was
implemented with the intervention group from March to July 2015. Follow-up surveys were
conducted with men and their current partners at 9 months, from 9 November to 17 Decem-
ber 2015 (4 months post-intervention), and again at 21 months, from 7 November to 23
December 2016 (16 months post-intervention). At 21 months, 99.6% of the women surveyed
were the same partner identified at baseline. At each follow-up, the participation of both part-
ners was not required: either partner could be interviewed even if the other was unavailable.
Study participants received a 2000 Rwandan franc transport stipend (about US$2.50) for each
interview. Sex-matched interviewers from Laterite, who had no involvement in the interven-
tion, conducted the interviews in Kinyarwanda in centrally located settings such as schools.
Data were collected on password-protected tablets.
All efforts were made to ensure study participant safety, privacy and comfort. Informed
consent was obtained from all participants. The interviewer reviewed the consent form with
each participant and answered any questions; participants signed a written consent if they
were literate, or provided a thumbprint if they were not. The study was conducted in accor-
dance with international ethical guidelines on researching violence against women, including
not interviewing members of the same household about IPV [20]. At follow-up, we asked
women about their experiences of IPV, but did not ask men about violence perpetration, and
men were not informed of the inclusion of questions about violence in the women’s question-
naire. To minimize risk of harm, we obtained men’s consent to disclose their participation in
the study before contacting their partners, and interviews with men and women were con-
ducted on different days. Participants were offered a list of locally available support services
after the interviews. Male and female interviewers received ethics and safety training and a
female Rwandan counselor met with the female interviewers before, during and after data
collection.
The study protocol received approval from the Rwanda National Health Research Commit-
tee (25 August 2014, NHRC/2014/PROT/0193), the Rwanda National Ethics Committee (24
October 2014, 346/RNEC/2014), and the Rwanda National Institute of Statistics (9 February
2015, 0082/2015/NISR) prior to study recruitment and data collection. As per Rwandan

 government requirements, study approval was renewed annually with the Rwanda National
Ethics Committee (19 October 2015, 338/RNEC/2015; 21 October 2016, 883/RNEC/2016) and
the Rwanda National Institute of Statistics (2 November 2015, 0794/2015/10/NISR; 27 October
2016, 0806/2016/10/NISR). The trial was retrospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov on Feb-
ruary 29, 2016 (NCT02694627) after study enrolment began in February 2015, but before col-
lection of the 21-month follow-up data (reported here) or study completion. The delay in trial
registration was due to the authors’ lack of awareness of this requirement for journal publica-
tion. We registered the study as soon as we were aware of this requirement. No major changes
to the study protocol or study outcomes were made. The authors confirm that all related trials
to this intervention were registered; there are no ongoing trials related to this study.
Study retention.
At 21-month follow-up, 1123 men (94% of the sample) and 1162 women
(97%) were surveyed. Respondent attrition was slightly higher for men in the intervention
group compared to the control group (7.3 vs. 5.4%), and was essentially identical for women
(3.1 vs. 3.0%) (Fig 1). Reasons for loss to follow-up were predominantly inability to find partic-
ipants due to relocation and respondent unavailability. Men who dropped out were more likely
to be out of work and looking for work at baseline compared to men who remained in the
study. All available data were included in analyses.

 implemented the intervention as part of MenCare+, a four-country initiative to engage men in
sexual, reproductive, and maternal health. The MenCare+ program was coordinated by Rutgers
and Promundo, and financed by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In Rwanda, the Men-
Care+ program was known as Bandebereho, or “role model”, as it aimed to transform norms
around masculinity by demonstrating positive models of fatherhood.
The intervention used a structured 15-session curriculum adapted from Program P, an
open source manual for engaging men in maternal and child health, created by Promundo,
CulturaSalud, and REDMAS (2013) which includes a curriculum for fathers/couples, resources
for designing health provider training and community campaigns [21]. Men participating in
the Bandebereho intervention were invited to 15 sessions (maximum 45 hours) and their part-
ners to 8 (maximum 24 hours). Sessions addressed: gender and power; fatherhood; couple
communication and decision-making; IPV; caregiving; child development; and male engage-
ment in reproductive and maternal health (See Table 1 for details on curriculum content by
session.)
Promundo and RWAMREC adapted the curriculum between May 2013 and January 2014,
informed by formative research, and input from the Rwanda Ministry of Health, which
approved the curriculum for implementation, and from community pilot implementations.

 The intervention draws on sociological theories of gender and masculinities that highlight
how gender inequalities are reproduced–or transformed–through “everyday interactions in
[the] home” [22,23]. The intervention creates a structured space for men and women to: 1)
question and critically reflect on gender norms and how these shape their lives; 2) rehearse
equitable and non-violent attitudes and behaviors in a comfortable space with supportive
peers; and 3) internalize these new gender attitudes and behaviors, and apply them in their
own lives and relationships. We hypothesize that becoming aware of inequalities, reflecting on
the costs of rigid norms, and learning and practicing new skills (e.g. couple communication
and joint decision-making) in a safe, non-judgmental peer environment, can lead to changes
across a range of health and relationship behaviors.
Community volunteers (local fathers) met with the same group of 12 men/couples on a
weekly basis. The volunteers received a two-week training, material support, and refresher
trainings from RWAMREC. Local nurses and police officers co-facilitated the sessions on
pregnancy, family planning, and local laws, respectively. Sessions were conducted in local
schools and administrative offices. A transportation stipend of 2000 Rwandan francs (about
US$2.50) was provided to men/couples for each session attended. RWAMREC staff monitored
implementation of the group sessions and mentored the facilitators. Three intervention cycles,
each with 570–576 couples, were implemented between March 2014 and July 2015. This study
assessed the third cycle, in which men attended on average 14.1 out of 15 sessions, and women
6.8 out of 8 sessions. The control group received no group intervention, though it did have
access to community activities and campaigns related to the broader MenCare+ project.
Measures
We assessed five sets of outcomes specifically targeted by the intervention, each captured
through multiple variables: (1) reproductive and maternal health behaviors, including men’s
participation in ANC visits; (2) women’s experiences of IPV; (3) use of physical punishment
against children; (4) gendered division of childcare and household tasks; and (5) men’s domi-
nance in household decision-making. Table 2 summarizes the key outcome measures.
Statistical analysis.
We compared men’s characteristics at baseline using frequencies and
descriptive statistics. To estimate the effects of the intervention on outcomes measured at
21-month follow-up, we conducted intention-to-treat analysis using regression models with
normal, Bernoulli, and Poisson response distributions and identity, logistic, and log link func-
tions. We used generalized estimating equations to fit the models, and used robust standard
errors with clustering by facilitator for hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction.
For each outcome we fit both unadjusted and adjusted models; the latter included controls for
age, education, and baseline socio-economic status (defined as having basic needs met). All
analyses were conducted using Stata/SE 14. In our presentation of results, we use standard
abbreviations for statistical terminology, including: SD–standard deviation; CI–confidence
interval; OR–odds ratio; and IRR–incidence rate ratio.
Results
Table 3 presents the baseline characteristics of men by intervention and control groups. Inde-
pendent samples t-tests and chi-squared tests of association, as appropriate, showed no statisti-
cally significant differences in baseline characteristics between the intervention and control
group respondents. Men reported a mean age of 28.7 and their partners’ mean age of 26.6
years. More than 60% of men had only primary education or less, and less than a third
reported always being able to afford basic items. Nearly all men were employed, with the

child in past month
Women;
Men
Men and women were asked seven
items adapted from the Multiple
Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) child
discipline module,a including whether
or not they: 1) shook the child; 2)
spanked, slapped or hit the child on the
bottom with a bare hand; 3) hit the child
on the bottom or elsewhere on the body
with something like a belt, stick or other
hard object; 4) hit or slapped the child
on the face, head, or ears; 5) hit or
slapped the child on the hand, arm, or
legs; 6) beat the child up, meaning hit
the child over and over as hard as one
could; and 7) made the child kneel on
the ground for a period of time.

Men and women were asked how they
divided 6 childcare and household tasks
with their partner: 1) washing clothes/
laundry; 2) cleaning the house and
surroundings; 3) cooking for the
household; 4) making the bed; 5)
providing daily care of children; and 6)
bathing children. Responses ranged
from 1 = woman always does the task,
3 = shared equally or done together,
5 = man always does the task.
Continuous scale of mean score
across the items, ranging from 1 to 5,
with 5 indicating men’s greater

This variable represents the number of
hours per day that men or women spent
on the 6 tasks in the past week.
Respondents were asked on how many
days in the previous week they did each
task, and how much time (in hours or
fractions of hours) on average they
spent on the task on each of those days.
Continuous, representing hours
spent per day: time spent per day for
each task was multiplied by the
reported days per week. The sum of
the total hours per week for all tasks
was divided by 7 to produce the
hours per day variable. “Not

 final say on decisions regarding the household’s income and expenses, and about 43% had the
final say on how many children to have or the spacing of children.
Table 4 presents the effect of the intervention on the outcomes of interest. Results from
analyses adjusted for age, level of education, and socio-economic status, are presented in the
text. Outcomes related to IPV were only asked of women. At 21-month follow-up, more than
half of women in the control group (56.53%) reported experiencing physical violence from the
partner in the previous 12 months, compared to one-third of women in the intervention
group (33.33%) (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.28–0.49 p<0.001). Similarly, rates of sexual violence from
a partner were 60�17% among women in the control group compared to 35.01% in the inter-
vention group (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.25–0.48, p<0.001).
Women in the intervention group reported attending slightly more ANC visits compared
to women in the control group (IRR 1.09, 95% CI 1.05–1.14). Both women and men in the
intervention group reported higher mean rates of men’s participation in ANC visits compared
to women (IRR 1.50, 95% CI 1.36–1.65, p<0.001) and men (IRR 1.33, 95% CI 1.23–1.45,

reported greater use of modern contraception compared to the control group (OR 1.53, 95% CI
1.15–2.04, p = 0.004 for women; OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.24–2.20, p = 0.001 for men). Women in the
intervention group reported higher levels of partner support during pregnancy (mean 0.92, SD
0.20 on a scale from 0 to 1) compared to women in the control group (mean 0.74, SD 0.34).
Physical punishment of children was reported by 79.15% of women and 67.30% of men in
the control group, compared to 68.25% of women (OR 0.56, CI 0.41–0.79, p = 0.001) and
57.71% of men in the intervention group (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.50–0.88, p = 0.005).
Intervention group participants reported higher levels of men’s participation in childcare
and household tasks compared to participants in the control group (Beta 0�39, 95% CI 0�31–
0.47, p<0.001 for women; beta 0.33, 95% CI 0.26–0.41, p<0.001 for men). While men in the
intervention group reported spending more hours on these tasks compared to men in the con-
trol group (Beta 0.86, 95% CI 0.50–1.22, p<0.001), there were no statistically significant differ-
ences in women’s time spent on these tasks between the intervention and control groups.
There were large differences in reports of men’s dominance in decision-making between
control and intervention groups. In the intervention group, 56.08% of women (OR 0.31, 95%
CI 0.24–0.42, p<0.001) and 45.47% of men (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.25–0.48, p<0.001) reported
that the man had the final say on decisions regarding the household’s income and expenses,
compared to 78.74% and 70.27% in the control group, respectively. For decisions about having
children or the spacing of children, 34�91% of women (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.45–0.72, p<0.001)
and 31.94% of men (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36–0.63, p<0.001) in the intervention group reported
that the man had the final say compared to 47.81% and 49.03% in the control group,
respectively.
Since women were not interviewed at baseline, it was not possible to adjust for baseline val-
ues for all indicators. However, including baseline values for the available men’s indicators
(accompaniment to ANC, contraceptive use, and decision-making variables) yields similar
results (not shown).
Discussion
The Bandebereho intervention led to substantial improvements in multiple reported out-
comes, including women’s experience of physical and sexual IPV, women’s ANC attendance,

 men’s accompaniment at ANC, modern contraceptive use, and partner support during preg-
nancy. Importantly, the intervention also led to reductions in men’s dominance in household
decision-making and improvements in the household division of labor. Notably, our findings
at 21-months are similar to those at 9 months (not reported here), suggesting sustained effects
over time. Our study strengthens the existing evidence on male engagement approaches;
together with earlier studies our findings suggest that culturally adapted gender-transformative
interventions with men and couples can be effective at changing deeply entrenched inequali-
ties and a range of health-related behavioral outcomes.
Our IPV findings are especially compelling, with a significant reduction in the likelihood of
both physical and sexual violence from a partner reported by women in the intervention group
compared to the control group. While previous trials have demonstrated reductions in
reported physical IPV [7], sexual IPV [7, 8], and men’s perpetration of IPV [6], the degree of
IPV risk reduction we report is seldom achieved in rigorously evaluated interventions [25].
Encouragingly, our study also demonstrated an impact on women’s and men’s physical pun-
ishment of children, despite this topic being of relatively limited focus in the intervention cur-
riculum. Consistent with global literature, we find higher rates of women’s use of harsh
punishment of children compared to men [26], likely due to the disproportionate amount of
time they spend caring for children. Our study strengthens evidence from recent non-trial
studies of male engagement approaches, such as the evaluation of REAL Fathers in Uganda
that found reductions in both harsh punishment of children and IPV perpetration, by focusing
on women’s reports of experiencing violence [27].
This is the first trial of a male engagement intervention, to our knowledge, to demonstrate
at least a modest impact on women’s ANC attendance [3,28]. We also show that the Bandeber-
eho intervention increased men’s accompaniment to ANC and their provision of support dur-
ing pregnancy, factors which may be associated with women’s increased care seeking.
Research by Påfs and colleagues in Rwanda has found that and men saw their presence at
maternal health services as important for ensuring their partners received quality care [29].
Previous male engagement trials in LMIC have demonstrated positive impact on partner assis-
tance during obstetric emergencies [12], women’s attendance at postpartum visits [13], care
seeking for problems during pregnancy and hospital delivery [14], and mixed results at
increasing male partner accompaniment to ANC [30]. Non-trial research has found that male
partner support is associated with women’s antenatal attendance, birth preparedness and use
of a skilled birth attendant [3,28]. Our results strengthen this evidence base.
The Bandebereho intervention also led to a substantial increase in the likelihood of reported
modern contraceptive use. We hypothesize that in addition to providing information about
contraceptives, the intervention strengthened couple communication, support, and joint deci-
sion-making, which positively affect contraceptive behavior. Brunie and colleagues have
reported that Rwandan women whose partners support family planning have more than 8
times greater odds of using contraceptives than women whose partners did not, with spousal
communication a facilitating factor [31]. Our findings complement evidence from the
CHARM and Malawi Male Motivator trials of gender-transformative family planning inter-
ventions, which also demonstrated increased modern contraceptive use and couple communi-
cation about contraception [8,11]. In both the intervention and control groups, men reported
slightly higher rates of modern contraceptive use compared to women. This discrepancy may
be due to several reasons, such as men’s lack of awareness of their partner’s use/non-use of
contraception at the specific time-point, or to a stronger social desirability bias among men, in
both control and intervention groups. Further research could explore this discrepancy.
The Bandebereho intervention demonstrated a reduction in men’s dominance in house-
hold decision-making, which is associated with negative health-related outcomes for women

 and children [32]. Our findings suggest that by emphasizing joint decision-making through
skills-based activities and by creating spaces for couple communication, the intervention was
successful at targeting underlying, unequal gendered power dynamics. Qualitative research by
Doyle and colleagues, in an earlier cycle of the Bandebereho intervention, found that men’s
participation in the intervention with their partner led to greater respect and value for their
partners’ opinions [33]. Future research should seek to understand how decision-making pat-
terns change, and how interventions that encourage and build joint decision-making skills
affect women’s own decision-making power.
The study is unique in measuring both the distribution of tasks between partners and in
collecting detailed time use data from both partners, while other studies have shown only
changes in men’s participation in these tasks [10, 15]. Encouragingly, the intervention led to
changes in the household division of labor, with both men and women reporting greater shar-
ing of childcare and household tasks, and men reporting more time spent on these tasks. Criti-
cal reflection on the gendered division of labor and its costs to the family–and skill building
around the care of infants–were a core focus for the intervention, leading to increased men’s
participation. However, despite greater male involvement, we did not find a reduction in
women’s time spent on these tasks, which is quite substantial at more than 8 hours per day.
This may be due to women in the intervention group having the time to take on additional
aspects of these tasks, or to couples doing these tasks together; further research should seek to
understand how tasks change or shift within the household as men take on greater caregiving
roles, and how men’s involvement can alleviate women’s care burden.
Our study is not without limitations. We were unable to collect baseline data from women
and the intervention constrained the sample design to randomization at the individual level.
We were unable to mask group assignment from participants or the data collectors, who were
not affiliated with the intervention. Like many behavioral interventions assessing violence and
reproductive health, our outcomes are self-reported, and intervention participants may be
more likely to report what they presume are desirable answers. However, collecting data from
men and women and at 21 months (which was 16 months after completion of the interven-
tion) might have mitigated some of these concerns. It is also important to note that our preva-
lence findings are not generalizable to the population of Rwanda. Finally, our follow-up time
frame is limited to 21 months, which, while longer than many studies, does not give a full pic-
ture of changes across the life-course.
Conclusions
Our study demonstrates that a gender-transformative intervention can positively impact a
range of health and gender-related behavioral outcomes. Our study builds on existing evidence
of male engagement interventions and makes unique contributions to measuring the impact of
male engagement on household power dynamics. While our findings show substantial positive
effects, high rates of inequality and violence persist: about one in three women in the interven-
tion group reported experiencing IPV in the past 12 months, the vast majority of parents used
physical punishment, and men still dominated household decisions. Further research should
examine whether these rates can be lowered if the intervention is implemented over longer time
periods or with additional components. Future research could also directly measure health out-
comes and use health facility or biomarker data to corroborate self-reported behavior change,
and examine the effect of the intervention if implemented over longer time periods, when
implemented with greater numbers and in other settings, or when delivered through the public
sector. Nevertheless, the findings highlight the promise of the Bandebereho intervention,
designed and adapted to fit the particular cultural context. Targeting the transition into

 fatherhood and parenting, and supporting couples with skills to make their relationships stron-
