IMPORTANCE Considerable efforts have been undertaken to relate single nutrients to bone
health. To this point, results are inconsistent. Suboptimal single nutrient intake does not
occur in isolation but rather reflects a poor diet quality.
OBJECTIVE To assess the association between adherence to a diet quality index constructed
on the basis of dietary recommendations or existing healthy dietary patterns and fractures in
postmenopausal women.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Post hoc analysis was conducted of longitudinal data
from 40 clinical centers throughout the United States included in the Women’
s Health
Initiative (WHI) observational study. Participants in the prospective cohort included 93 676
women who were eligible for the WHI if they were aged 50 to 79 years. Recruitment was
conducted from October 1, 1993, to December 31, 1998, with the study ending August 29,
2014. The WHI food frequency questionnaire was used to derive nutrient and food intake at
baseline. Diet quality and adherence were assessed by scores on the alternate Mediterranean
Diet (aMED), a 9-category measure of adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern; the
Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI-2010), a 100-point measure of 12 food components; the
11-item Alternate Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010); or the 8-component Dietary
Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet score.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Outcome measures included incident total and hip
fractures. Hazard ratios (HRs) by quintiles of dietary index scores were estimated using Cox
proportional hazards regression analyses.
RESULTS Of the 93 676 participants, 90 014 were included in the analysis (mean [SD] age,
63.6 [7.4]) years. During a median follow-up time of 15.9 years, there were 2121 cases of hip
fractures and 28 718 cases of total fractures. Women scoring in the highest quintile (Q5) of
the aMED index had a lower risk for hip fractures (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.66-0.97), with an
absolute risk reduction of 0.29% and a number needed to treat of 342 (95% CI, 249-502). No
association between the aMED score and total fractures was observed (Q5 HR, 1.01; 95% CI,
0.95-1.07). Higher HEI-2010 or DASH scores tended to be inversely related to hip fracture
risk, but the results were nonsignificant (Q5 HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75-1.02; and Q5 HR, 0.89;
95% CI, 0.75-1.06, respectively). The AHEI-2010 score was associated with neither hip nor
total fractures.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet is associated with a
lower risk for hip fractures. These results support that a healthy dietary pattern may play a
role in maintaining bone health in postmenopausal women.

O
steoporotic fractures constitute a major burden for
health care systems in aging societies. Although con-
siderable research1-6 has examined whether intake of
nutrients involved in bone metabolism, such as protein, cal-
cium, or unsaturated fat, can prevent fracture events, the find-
ings are not consistent. However, suboptimal single nutrient
intake does not occur in isolation but rather reflects a poor-
quality diet.7
Several descriptive epidemiologic studies8-10 have shown
that the incidence of osteoporosis and osteoporosis-related
fractures varies across nations, with a tendency of lower rates
in Mediterranean compared with northern European coun-
tries. These differences have been attributed to life-style fac-
tors, including specific dietary patterns. The traditional Medi-
terranean-style diet emphasizes the consumption of dietary
components, such as plant foods, fish, nuts, and monounsat-
urated fat, which have been shown11,12 to impart beneficial ef-
fects on bone health. Adherence to a Mediterranean diet was
previously operationalized by a dietary scoring system and
modified to be applied to non-Mediterranean populations.13
This Mediterranean diet score has been associated with a de-
creased hip fracture risk, particularly among men,14 but over-
all evidence is inconclusive.15 Moreover, data are sparse as to
whetherotherdietaryscoringsystemsthatcharacterizeahigh-
quality diet preserve bone health.16 Comprehensive analyses
investigating the association between various commonly rec-
ommended dietary quality indexes and fracture risk in the
United States are warranted.
The primary aim of this study was to examine the asso-
ciation between adherence to a diet quality index con-
structed on the basis of dietary recommendations or existing
healthy dietary patterns and bone outcomes (hip or total frac-
tures) in a large population of postmenopausal women. Spe-
cifically, diet quality was assessed using the alternate Medi-
terraneanDiet(aMED)score,13,17theHealthyEatingIndex2010
(HEI-2010),18 the Alternate Healthy Eating Index 2010
(AHEI-2010),19,20 or the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hyper-
tension (DASH) score.21 As a secondary aim, the associations
between diet quality, bone mineral density (BMD), and lean
body mass measurements were examined. Given prior epide-
miologic data14,16 and the composition of the aMED index, we
hypothesizedthathighaMEDscoringwouldbeassociatedwith
a lower fracture risk.
Methods
Study Population
The study population consisted of 93 676 women enrolled in
the Women’
s Health Initiative observational study (WHI-OS)
(clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00000611).22-25 The WHI-OS24 exam-
ined the indicators and natural history of important causes of
morbidity and mortality in postmenopausal women. Women
were recruited from October 1, 1993, to December 31, 1998, at
40 clinical centers in the United States and were eligible for
the WHI-OS if they were aged 50 to 79 years, were generally
healthy, and were postmenopausal at the time of enrollment.
Institutional review boards at participating institutions ap-
proved all protocols, and all participants provided written in-
formed consent.
For the present analysis, data from women with extreme
energy intake (ie, <600 kcal/d or >5000 kcal/d) were ex-
cluded because these reported intakes were judged to be im-
plausible (n = 3662).26 Our final study population included
90 014 women who were monitored through August 29, 2014,
with a median follow-up time of 15.9 years (Figure).
Food Frequency Questionnaires
Nutrient and food intake was derived from self-report through
WHI food frequency questionnaires (WHI-FFQs) at baseline.26
The WHI-FFQ is based on the Block FFQ.26,27 The main differ-
ences between the measures are the addition of questions to
make the WHI-FFQ more sensitive to fat intake (including low-
fat food preparation methods and reduced-fat foods) and fruit
and vegetable consumption.26 The WHI-FFQ nutrient data-
base was derived from the University of Minnesota Nutrition
Coordinating Center food and nutrient database.28 The
WHI-FFQ has demonstrated good validity as a measurement
of dietary intake compared with 24-hour dietary recalls and
food records.26 The WHI-FFQ has also been validated against
biomarkers of nutrients important to bone health, including
protein and polyunsaturated fatty acids.29,30
Assessment of Dietary Patterns
Based on nutrient and food items intake, dietary indexes
(aMED, HEI-2010, AHEI-2010, and DASH) were used to assess
the extent of adherence to various dietary patterns.13,18,19,31-33
Fooditemsweretransformedintostandardizedquantitieswith

TheaMEDscorewasdesignedtoassessadherencetoaMedi-
terranean dietary pattern. Total aMED scoring ranges from 0
(nonadherence) to 9 (perfect adherence). It includes the fol-
lowing food items13,17,32,33: (1) fruits, (2) vegetables, (3) nuts, (4)
legumes, (5) whole grains, (6) fish, (7) ratio of monounsatu-
rated to saturated fat, (8) red and processed meats, and (9)
alcohol. Participants whose intake was above the median for
fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, whole grains, fish, or ratio of
monounsaturated to saturated fat received 1 point for each cat-
egory. Consumption of red and processed meat below the me-
dian was awarded 1 point, and alcohol intake between 5 and 15
g/d was awarded 1 point; otherwise, women received 0 points.
Key Points
Question Does diet quality affect bone health in postmenopausal
women?
Findings In the Women’
s Health Initiative observational study, of
90 014 postmenopausal women, higher diet quality based on a
Mediterranean diet that emphasizes the consumption of fruits,
vegetables, fish, nuts, legumes, whole grains, and intake of
monounsaturated fat, as well as avoidance of red and processed
meats, was found to be associated with a lower risk for hip
fractures.
Meaning A healthy dietary pattern may play a role in maintaining
bone health in postmenopausal women.

The HEI-2010 aligns with the US Dietary Guidelines for
Americans of 2010, and scores range from 0 (nonadherence)
to 100 (perfect adherence) points.18,32 The HEI-2010 consists
of 12 components as previously outlined: 6 components—
total vegetables, total fruit, whole fruit, seafood proteins, plant
proteins, and total protein foods—are worth 0 to 5 points each;
5 components—whole grains, low-fat dairy, fatty acids ratio
([polyunsaturated fatty acids plus monounsaturated fatty
acids] to saturated fatty acids), refined grains, and sodium—
are worth 0 to 10 points each; and 1 component—empty
calories (energy from solid fats, added sugars, and any alco-
hol in excess of 13 g per 1000 kcal)—are worth 0 to 20
points. All food components except for the fatty acids ratio
are scored on a density basis (per 1000 kcal or as a percent-
age of energy). Three components (sodium, refined grains,
and empty calories) are reverse scored (ie, higher intakes
receive lower scores).18
The AHEI-2010 was designed as an alternative to the
HEI-2010, and scoring can range from 0 (nonadherence) to 110
(perfect adherence).19,20,31,32 The AHEI-2010 includes 11 items,
and each component intake is evaluated from 0 (worst) to 10
(best). The AHEI-2010 emphasizes vegetables, fruits, whole
grains, nuts, legumes, vegetable proteins, long-chain ω-3 poly-
unsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids (exclud-
ing long-chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids), moderate al-
cohol intake, and lower intakes of sugar-sweetened beverages
and fruit juice, red and processed meats, and sodium as well
as avoidance of trans-fat.
The DASH diet score considers intake of (1) fruits, (2) veg-
etables,(3)nutsandlegumes,(4)low-fatdairy,(5)wholegrains,
(6) sodium, (7) sweetened beverages, and (8) red and pro-
cessed meats.21,32,33 The score is based on quintile rankings
within the population. For fruits, vegetables, nuts and le-
gumes,low-fatdairy,andwholegrains,participantsinthehigh-
est quintile receive a score of 5, those in the second-highest
quintile receive a score of 4, and so on. For sodium, sweet-
ened beverages, and red and processed meats, scoring is re-
versed (ie, women in the highest quintile receive a minimum
score of 1, whereas participants in the lowest quintile receive
a maximum score of 5). The score for each component is
summed, and the overall score ranges from 8 (no adherence)
to 40 (perfect adherence).
Outcome Ascertainment
Primary outcome measures included incident hip and total
fractures. In the WHI-OS, all fracture outcomes were self-
reported except hip fractures, which were assigned a diagno-
sis by local trained physician adjudicators and centrally
confirmed by a second medical record review.35,36 Toe, fin-
ger,sternum,andclaviclefracturesastotalfractureeventswere
excluded since these fractures are less likely related to
osteoporosis.37,38
Bone mineral density at the femoral neck (hip) and total
body as well as lean body mass were measured at baseline and
after 6 years in a subset of WHI participants (WHI-BMD co-
hort[n = 11 020])at3ofthe40clinicalcentersoftheWHI(Pitts-
burgh, Pennsylvania; Birmingham, Alabama; and Phoenix and
Tucson, Arizona) with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (Ho-
logic QDR densitometer; Hologic Inc).39,40 Of the 11 020 par-
ticipants in the WHI-BMD cohort, 278 women did not un-
dergo BMD measurements at baseline, whereas 2740 were not
measured at the 6-year follow-up visit. A total of 421 women
were excluded owing to extreme energy intake. The final
samplesizefortheBMDanalysiswas7961participants(Figure).
Exclusion criteria were not mutually exclusive.
Covariate Assessment
Information on age, race/ethnicity, educational level, family
income, personal history of fracture, history of falls, self-
rated health, and smoking status was obtained by self-report
questionnaires at baseline.22,24 Physical function was as-
sessed by a 36-item Short-Form Health Survey.41,42 Current
medication use was assessed by clinic interviewers.22,24 His-
tory of cardiovascular disease was coded as positive if the par-
ticipantreportedahistoryofmyocardialinfarction,anginapec-
toris, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, peripheral vascular
disease, coronary bypass surgery, angioplasty, or carotid end-
arterectomy. Women were classified as having diabetes melli-
tus on the basis of self-report of diabetes or self-report of
diabetes treatment. For each participant, the number of self-
reportedchronicmedicalconditions(ie,stroke,anycancer,his-
tory of cardiovascular disease, arthritis, hypertension, diabe-
tes, and emphysema) and the number of psychoactive
medications (ie, anxiolytics, hypnotics, antidepressants, an-
tipsychotics, and antiepileptic agents) was calculated.
Statistical Analysis
To assess the associations of aMED, HEI-2010, AHEI-2010, and
DASH with incident fractures, quintiles of each exposure vari-
able of interest were formed based on the distribution of non-
cases in the WHI-OS cohort. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk

were at a lower risk for hip fractures (0.80 [0.66-0.97]), with
an absolute risk reduction of 0.29% and a number needed
to treat of 342 (95% CI, 249-502). No association between
aMED and total fractures was observed (Q5 HR, 1.01 [0.95-
1.07]). Higher HEI-2010 or DASH scoring tended to be
inversely related to hip fracture risk (Q5 HR, 0.87 [0.75-1.02]
and 0.89 [0.75-1.06], respectively), but the results were
nonsignificant. No association between HEI-2010, DASH,
and total fracture risk (Q5 HR, 0.98 [0.93-1.02] and 0.98
[0.94-1.03]), respectively, was found. Scores within the
highest quintile of AHEI-2010 were not significantly associ-
ated with hip or total fractures (Q5 HR, 0.94 [0.80-1.09] and
1.01 [0.96-1.05], respectively). To account for the propensity
to fall, the fall history was further included in our statistical
modeling (eTable 1 in the Supplement); the main results did
not change.
The BMD and lean body mass measurements at baseline
and year 6 by quintiles of dietary pattern scoring are pre-
sented in eTable 2 and eTable 3, respectively, in the Supple-
ment. No clinically significant differences in BMD loss and no
clinically significant changes of lean body mass over time were
found.
Discussion
The primary aim of this study was to investigate the associa-
tion between adherence to a diet quality index and fracture
risk in a large sample of postmenopausal women. Women who
were highly adherent to a Mediterranean dietary pattern
(aMED) that emphasizes the consumption of fruits, veg-
etables, fish, nuts, legumes, and whole grains; intake of mono-
unsaturated fat; and avoidance of red and processed meats
were found to have a lower risk for hip fracture, but the abso-
lute risk reduction was small.
At this time, epidemiologic evidence8-10 suggests that frac-
ture rates vary geographically. Lifestyle differences, includ-
ing diet quality, may be part of an explanation for regional and
local discrepancies. Previous research16 on diet quality scores
based on case-control data in a Chinese population suggests
that avoiding a low-quality diet is associated with a lower risk
of hip fractures in elderly individuals and that the aMED score
appears to be the best scoring system for consumers because
of its simplicity. The aMED, HEI-2010, AHEI-2010, and DASH
dietary measures have many similarities since all dietary pat-
terns include vegetables, fruits, vegetable protein, and whole
grains, but there are also distinctive differences.13,18,19,21
Whereas the AHEI-2010 emphasizes low intake of red and pro-
cessed meats and high intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids,
the aMED promotes intake of monounsaturated fat, largely
from olive oil, and fish intake. Similarly, the HEI-2010 in-
cludes an increased emphasis on seafood and plant proteins.18
Both plant proteins and unsaturated fatty acids have been
shown4,6tobebeneficialforbonehealth.However,aMEDdoes
notlimitsodiumintakeasdotheHEI-2010,AHEI-2010,or,spe-
cifically, the DASH diet. Data from randomized clinical trials43
suggest that adherence to the DASH diet lowers bone turn-
over and imparts beneficial effects on bone health.

Our data support an association between the extent of ad-
herencetoahealthydietcharacterizedbyadherencetoaMedi-
terraneandietandlowerfracturerisk.However,giventheappar-
ent risk reductions across various dietary patterns, a specific
dietaryindexmaynotbeassociatedwithlowerrisk;rather,high
diet quality reflected by various dietary indexes and their com-
mon components may achieve a lower risk. The lack of an asso-
ciationwithtotalfracturesmaybeexplainedbythewidehetero-
geneity of fracture types in our analyses. However, because the
propensitytofallisamajorriskfactorforfracturesinthesenior
population,additionalanalysesaccountingforfallhistorywere
undertaken—themainresultsdidnotchange.Finally,sincediet
may also relate to muscle mass and BMD and thereby prevent
fractures,wefurtherinvestigatedwhetherhigherdietqualitywas
associated with greater lean body mass or less loss of BMD. No
clinically significant changes over time were observed.
Strengths of our analysis include a large, well-character-
izedstudycohortwithlong-termfollow-upandadjudicatedhip
fracture outcome events. Conversely, there are several limita-
tions. First, because our study included only postmenopausal
women in overall good health, external validity may be lim-
ited and residual confounding may explain parts of the find-
ings since risk reduction was small. Our data showed marked
differences in fracture risk across quintiles of multiple indica-
tors of fractures; these differences may suggest the possibility
ofotherconfoundingfactors.Second,assessmentofdietarypat-
terns was based on indexes that operationalize various food
items derived from FFQs at baseline. Exposure variability is
therefore limited. Moreover, assessment of certain nutrients,
such as sodium or potassium, with FFQs is problematic.44,45
Finally,outcomeeventsonfracturesotherthanthehipwereself-
reported, and misclassification bias may be present. However,
previous data from WHI36 show that agreements between
self-reports for single-site fractures and medical records were
generally high; thus, this bias can be considered as low.
Conclusions
High diet quality characterized by adherence to a Mediterra-
nean diet is associated with a lower risk for hip fractures. These
results support the notion that following a healthy dietary pat-
tern may play a role in the maintenance of bone health in post-
menopausal women.
