Probability Sample of US Adults, 2014
Halley P. Crissman, MD, MPH, Mitchell B. Berger, MD, PhD, Louis F. Graham, PhD, MPH, and Vanessa K. Dalton, MD, MPH
Objectives.To estimate the proportion of US adults who identify as transgender and to
compare the demographics of the transgender and nontransgender populations.
Methods. We conducted a secondary analysis of data from states and territories in the
2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System that asked about transgender status.
The proportion of adults identified as transgender was calculated from affirmative and
negative responses (n = 151 456). We analyzed data with a design-adjusted c2 test. We
also explored differences between male-to-female and nontransgender females and
female-to-male and nontransgender males.
Results.Transgender individuals made up 0.53% (95% confidence interval = 0.46, 0.61)
of the population and were more likely to be non-White (40.0% vs 27.3%) and below the
poverty line (26.0% vs15.5%); aslikelytobe married (50.5% vs47.7%), living in arural area
(28.7% vs 22.6%), and employed (54.3% vs 57.7%); and less likely to attend college
(35.6% vs 56.6%) compared with nontransgender individuals.
Conclusions. Our findings suggest that the transgender population is a racially
diverse population present across US communities. Inequalities in the educa-
tion and socioeconomic status have negative implications for the health of the
transgender population. (Am J Public Health. 2017;107:213–215. doi:10.2105/

n 2011, the Institute of Medicine described
data on the proportion of people in the
United States who identify as transgender as
“sorely lacking” and called for research on
transgender demographics.1 Transgender is
a term for individuals whose gender expres-
sion and gender identity do not align with
cultural expectations and gender norms as-
sociated with their sex assignment at birth.1
National surveys have not historically in-
cluded questions about transgender identity.
To date, estimates of the proportion of in-
dividuals who identify as transgender have
been calculated from data such as disclosure of
transgender status to a medical provider and
single-state or nonprobability surveys.2–7
Recently, the inclusion of a question about
transgender status in the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) Behavioral
Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)
survey has provided a novel opportunity to
learn more about the US adult transgender
population. In a white paper published in June
2016, Flores et al.8 used BRFSS data from 19
states to estimate that 0.5% of the respondents
identified as transgender and imputed that 0.6%
of adults identify as transgender nationwide.
Beyond data on the portion of individuals
identified as transgender, information about
the demographics of the transgender pop-
ulation is needed to identify inequities; fa-
cilitate public health efforts to address health
disparities, including disproportionately
high rates of HIV, suicide, and violence
against the transgender community9; and
lend data to policies focused on the trans-
gender population. Our objective was to
provide estimates of the demographic
characteristics of the US adult transgender
population compared with the non-
transgender population.
METHODS
Data were obtained from the BRFSS, an
annual cross-sectional landline and cellular tele-
phone state-based health survey conducted by
theCDCinallUSstatesand3USterritories.10A
complex probability sampling technique is used
to sample English- and Spanish-speaking US
residents at least 18 years of age.
The BRFSS includes optional modules that
states may choose to include in their annual
survey. In 2014, an optional “gender identity”
modulewas adopted by19states anda territory
(Delaware, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana,
Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland,
Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New York,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia,
Wisconsin, Wyoming). Survey respondents
(n= 169 392) were asked, “Do you consider
yourself to be transgender?” A definition of
transgender was read to those who expressed
confusion. Individuals who identified as
transgender were asked, “Do you consider
yourself to be male-to-female (MTF), female-
to-male (FTM), or gender nonconforming?”
Demographic covariates of interest in-
cluded age (18–29, 30–49, and ‡ 50 years),
race/ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic,
and other including “not sure” and “refused
to answer”), marital status (married vs di-
vorced, widowed, separated, never married,
partnered), education (some college atten-
dance vs less than college), employment

 workforce [homemaker, student, retired, un-
able to work], or employed [employed
for wages, self-employed]), and living in a rural
setting (as determined by metropolitan statis-
tical area). We calculated household percent-
age of the poverty line by using household size
and income recoded to the midpoint for each
income range and to the 80th percentile
($112 262) for those in the highest income
category.11 We divided recoded income by
size-specific poverty thresholds.11
We restricted the analytic sample to states
and territories that asked about, and in-
dividuals who provided, their transgender
status (excluding 15 330 with missing re-
sponses, 1468 who declined to respond, and
1138 who responded “don’t know”). We
used this subpopulation (n = 151 456)
to calculate the proportion of individuals
who identify as transgender. We used
Stata version 14.0 (StataCorp LP, College
Station, TX) to perform a design-adjusted
c2 test of the association of transgender
identity with demographic covariates. All
results were weighted. Tests of statistical
association were 2-tailed (a = 0.05).
RESULTS
Transgender individuals made up 0.53%
(95% confidence interval [CI]= 0.46, 0.61) of
the population, with a larger proportion of
individuals identifying as male-to-female
(0.28% of the population; 95% CI= 0.23,
0.33) than female-to-male (0.16%; 95%
CI= 0.12, 0.21) or gender nonconforming
(0.08%; 95% CI= 0.06, 0.13). Overall, trans-
gender respondents were not significantly
different from the nontransgender population
with regard to age, living in a rural area, marital
status, or employment (Table 1). Male-to-
female transgender respondents were more
likely to live in rural areas (36.2%; 95%
CI= 24.0, 50.4) compared with non-
transgender females (22.3%; 95% CI= 21.8,
22.8). Race/ethnicity and transgender status
were associated with a greater proportion of
transgender individuals identifying as non-
White compared with the nontransgender
population (Table 1). Nontransgender

college and less likely to be in poverty than
were transgender respondents (Table 1).
DISCUSSION
Consistent with findings from the Williams
Institute white paper,8 we found that ap-
proximately 1 in 189 US adults identifies as
transgender. Our findings suggest that the
transgender population is racially diverse,
with higher rates of poverty and lower rates
of college attendance than in the non-
transgender population.
Given the high rates of discrimination and
harassment transgender individuals face in
school, inequalities in educational attainment
are not surprising.9,12 However, these findings,
as well as the racial composition of the trans-
gender population, differ in comparison with
the largest US nonprobability sample of
transgender individuals,9 which found a higher
proportion of White respondents (76%) and
higher rates of college attendance (83%). Al-
though convenience sample data have con-
tributed significantly to our understanding of
the transgender population, these differences
highlight the potential biases of convenience
dataandthe importanceofprobabilitysamples.
Demographic comparison of male-to-
female individuals with nontransgender
females and female-to-male individuals with
nontransgender males generally reflected the
overall transgender to nontransgender com-
parison. However, no statistically significant
difference in poverty was found when com-
paring the male-to-female population with
nontransgender females. This may reflect
sample size limitations, overall pay suppression
for individuals with feminine genders, and the
influence of low poverty rates among non-
transgender males on the poverty gap between
transgender and nontransgender individuals.
Unexpectedly, we also found that male-to-
female individuals were more likely to live in
rural areas than were nontransgender females;
moreresearch isneeded toexplorethisfinding.
Our estimate of the proportion of in-
dividuals who identify as transgender has
several limitations, which may result in an
underestimation. Respondents may have de-
nied transgender identity because of concerns
about privacy, safety, or transphobia. Our
estimatedoes notcapture individualswhohave
transitioned and do not identify as transgender
(e.g., natal females who identify as men) or
gender-nonconforming individuals who do
not identify as transgender (potentially in-
cluding those who responded “don’t know”
for transgender status).
The national generalizability of our find-
ings may have been affected by incomplete
participation of states, missing responses for
transgender status, and telephone survey bias
toward affluent participants. Our findings
also were limited by potential collinearity
and the lack of validation of the transgender
status question.
PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS
This demographic description of the
transgender population provides opportuni-
ties for public health practitioners to design
programming to meet the needs of this his-
torically marginalized population and for
public policy officials to better understand the
effect of legislation (e.g., regarding bathroom
access). Disparities in educational attainment
and socioeconomic status have negative
health implications for the transgender
community, may intersect with racial in-
equalities, and provide support for tackling
factors deterring transgender individuals from
continuing education, including harassment
and discrimination.9 Public health pro-
fessionals can play a critical role in expanding
our understanding of the transgender com-
munity by including separate measures of
natal sex, gender identity, and transgender
status in survey work.
