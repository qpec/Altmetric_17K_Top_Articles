IMPORTANCE Ankle fractures cause substantial morbidity in older persons. Surgical fixation is
the contemporary intervention but is associated with infection and other healing complications.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether initial fracture treatment with close contact casting, a
molded below-knee cast with minimal padding, offers outcome equivalent to that with
immediate surgery, with fewer complications and less health resource use.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a pragmatic, equivalence, randomized clinical
trial with blinded outcome assessors. A pilot study commenced in May 2004, followed by
multicenter recruitment from July 2010 to November 2013; follow-up was completed May
2014. Recruitment was from 24 UK major trauma centers and general hospitals. Participants
were 620 adults older than 60 years with acute, overtly unstable ankle fracture. Exclusions
were serious limb or concomitant disease or substantial cognitive impairment.
INTERVENTIONS Participantswererandomlyassignedtosurgery(n = 309)orcasting(n = 311).

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary 6-month, per-protocol outcome was the
Olerud-Molander Ankle Score at 6 months (OMAS; range, 0-100; higher scores indicate
better outcomes and fewer symptoms), equivalence prespecified as ±6 points. Secondary
outcomes were quality of life, pain, ankle motion, mobility, complications, health resource
use, and patient satisfaction.
RESULTS Among 620 adults (mean age, 71 years; 460 [74%] women) who were randomized,
593 (96%) completed the study. Nearly all participants (579/620; 93%) received allocated
treatment; 52 of 275 (19%) who initially received casting later converted to surgery, which was
allowable in the casting treatment pathway to manage early loss of fracture reduction.
At 6 months, casting resulted in ankle function equivalent to that with surgery (OMAS score,
66.0 [95% CI, 63.6-68.5] for surgery vs 64.5 [95% CI, 61.8-67.2] for casting; mean difference,
–0.6 [95% CI, –3.9 to 2.6]; P for equivalence = .001). Infection and wound breakdown were
more common with surgery (29/298 [10%] vs 4/275 [1%]; odds ratio [OR], 7.3 [95% CI,
2.6-20.2]), as were additional operating room procedures (18/298 [6%] for surgery and 3/275
[1%] for casting; OR, 5.8 [95% CI, 1.8-18.7]). Radiologic malunion was more common in the
casting group (38/249 [15%] vs 8/274 [3%] for surgery; OR, 6.0 [95% CI, 2.8-12.9]).
Casting required less operating room time compared with surgery (mean difference
[minutes/participant], –54 [95% CI, –58 to –50]). There were no significant differences in other
secondary outcomes: quality of life, pain, ankle motion, mobility, and patient satisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among older adults with unstable ankle fracture, the use of
close contact casting compared with surgery resulted in similar functional outcomes at
6 months. Close contact casting may be an appropriate treatment for such patients.

T
he number of older adults sustaining ankle fractures is
increasing,1andtheyexperiencedisproportionatelypoor
outcomes.2 Ankle fractures cause loss of independence
and quality of life, incurring substantial health costs.3-5 Treat-
ment of unstable fractures is either surgical, using open reduc-
tion and internal fixation, or nonsurgical, using externally ap-
plied casts. Neither method yields an entirely satisfactory
outcome in older adults. Traditional casting techniques are as-
sociated with poor fracture alignment and healing, as well as
plastersores.6Surgeryisoftencomplicatedbypoorimplantfixa-
tion,woundproblems,andinfection.7ACochranereviewofsur-
gery vs casting for ankle fractures was unable to make recom-
mendations because of poor-quality studies.8
A modified casting technique has been developed, close
contactcasting,whichusesminimalpaddingcomparedwithtra-
ditional casting and achieves fracture reduction by distribut-
ing contact pressure by close anatomic fit. The clinical strategy
of close contact casting was to use this as the first-line treat-
ment,recognizingthatifreductionwerenotpossibleduringthe
procedure or could not be retained in the immediate postop-
erative phase (up to 3 weeks), the treatment protocol allowed
surgery.TheintentionoftheAnkleInjuryManagementTrialwas
to investigate in older adults with unstable ankle fractures
whether initial fracture management with close contact cast-
ing resulted in an outcome equivalent to that with immediate
surgery, with fewer complications and less resource use.
Methods
Study Design and Eligibility Criteria
This pragmatic, multicenter, equivalence randomized clini-
cal trial with blinded outcome assessors was conducted at 24
UK trauma centers and district general hospitals. Partici-
pants were adults older than 60 years presenting with acute
malleolar fracture(s) and an unstable ankle joint on the initial
radiograph who would normally be offered surgery. Patients
requiring stress radiographs to elicit talar instability were ex-
cluded. Patients were included if they were ambulatory be-
fore injury, able to provide informed consent and follow in-
structions,andlivedneararecruitinghospitalandcouldattend
the 6-month follow-up. Patients with critical limb ischemia,
insulin-dependentdiabetesmellitus,activelegulceration,open
fractures, serious concomitant disease (ie, terminal illness),
substantial ankle arthritis, or substantial cognitive impair-
ment (Mini-Mental State Examination score <16/30),9 or who
were unfit for anesthesia, were excluded. All participants pro-
vided written informed consent.
The study was approved by the National Research Ethics
Service Oxfordshire Committee. The trial protocol is avail-
able in Supplement 1.10 The trial was overseen by indepen-
dent steering and data and safety monitoring committees.
Randomization and Blinding
After providing consent and undergoing baseline assessments,
participantswereindividuallyrandomizedtoreceivesurgeryor
closecontactcasting(Figure)ina1:1allocationbyhospitalstaff,
using a 24-hour telephone service at an independent organiza-
tion(AberdeenUniversity).Concealmentwasensuredbyregis-
teringparticipantsbeforecomputergenerationoftheallocation.
Randomization was stratified by center and fracture pattern
(infrasyndesmotic/trans-syndesmoticvssuprasyndesmotic)and
used random permuted blocks of lengths 2 and 4.
A blinded health professional performed outcome assess-
ments at the primary end point (6 months). Before assess-
ments, opaque ankle bandages were applied to obscure the
ankle. The James blinding index was used to assess success of
blinding (0 [total lack of blinding] to 1 [complete blinding]).11
The assessments at 6 weeks were not blinded because the as-
sessor needed knowledge of postoperative instructions for
weight bearing and movement. It was not possible to mask the
surgeons or participants because of the nature of the interven-
tions, nor was it possible to mask the radiograph assessors.
Interventions
Surgery was internal fixation conducted with internationally
recognized principles and techniques.12 Selection of
implants, postoperative splinting, immediate or delayed
weight bearing, and clinical follow-up were according to
usual local practice and the surgeon’
s preference. The
close contact cast was applied in an operating room under
general or spinal anesthesia by an orthopedic surgeon imme-
diately after closed fracture reduction. Instructions were to
achieve joint congruence with no talar shift or tilt. The close
contact casting application was first a stockinette bandage
(BSN Medical GmbH) and then shaped, self-adhesive foam
pads (Fleecy Foam 5 mm; Hapla) placed over prominences
(tibial crest, fibular head, calcaneum, Achilles tendon, and
metatarsal heads) and medial and lateral sides of the ankle,
where molding pressure was applied to hold the fracture
reduction. The exact molding points for each participant
were at the surgeon’
s discretion. Then 2 self-adhesive strips
were applied to the full length of the cast (Fleecy web roll
5 cm; Hapla) to prevent plaster saw injury during removal.
Finally, a single nonoverlapping synthetic wool layer (Soffban
Plus; BSN Medical GmbH), plaster of paris (Gypsona; BSN
Medical GmbH), and a reinforcing topcoat of synthetic cast-
ing material (Soft Cast Casting Tape; 3M Health Cate Ltd)
were applied below the knee. All surgeons who applied cast-
ing had completed a 1-hour training session, supplemented
Key Points
Question Does close contact casting (a molded below-knee cast
with minimal padding) compared with internal fixation surgery
result in an equivalent functional outcome for adults older than
60 years with an unstable ankle fracture?
Findings In this randomized equivalence clinical trial that included
620 adults from 24 hospitals, ankle function measures, which
included postfracture symptoms, quality of life, pain, ankle motion,
and mobility, were equivalent at 6 months in both groups. Infection
and wound breakdown were more common with surgery.
Meaning Close contact casting may be an appropriate alternative
treatment to surgery for older adult patients with unstable
ankle fracture.

surgeon who had completed training. Joint congruence was
monitored with radiographs in the weeks after initial close
contact cast application and after any reapplications for cast
loosening. Reapplications did not require anesthesia. The
protocol specified that if during clinical follow-up there was, in
the treating surgeon’
s opinion, an unacceptable loss of fracture

The treatment protocol anticipated and allowed sce-
narios in which allocated treatment might have to be modi-
fied.Participantsinthecastingallocationcouldproceedtosur-
gery when reduction could not be achieved or held with close
contact casting in the operating room. Participants in the sur-
gical allocation could proceed to traditional casting or exter-
nal fixation when incision was considered unsafe, but not to
close contact casting. For both allocations, a temporary treat-
ment could be undertaken in the operating room (manipula-
tion and splinting or external fixation) until it was appropri-
ate to receive the allocated treatment. Each hospital followed
its own protocols for thromboprophylaxis, surgical antibiotic
prophylaxis, and rehabilitation.
Data Collection and Outcome Measures
Follow-up was at 6 weeks and 6 months after randomization,
using patient-reported questionnaires and performance tests
at a clinic visit. When participants could not attend the clinic,
questionnaires were collected by telephone or mail.
The primary outcome measure was the Olerud-Molander
Ankle Score (OMAS; scale 0-100, with higher scores indicating
better function), a measure of ankle fracture symptoms.13 Sec-
ondary outcomes were the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey
(SF-12version1)14(scale0-100,withhigherscoresindicatingbet-
terqualityoflife)andEuroQol5dimensionsquestionnaire,3lev-
els (EQ-5D-3L) (scale 0 [death] to 1 [perfect health]; negative
scoresarereflectiveofapatient’
squalityoflifebeingworsethan
death).15 Pain was estimated using relevant subscales of the
OMAS (rated 1-5, with 1 indicating “none” and 5 indicating
“constant and severe”) and EQ-5D (rated 1-3, with 1 indicating
“no pain or discomfort” and 3 indicating “extreme pain or dis-
comfort”). We also collected assessments of patient satisfac-
tion (rated 1-5, with 1 indicating “very dissatisfied” and 5 indi-
cating “very satisfied”) and health care resource use (operating
room time, surgical implants, casting, hospital stay, and
follow-upcare).Patient-reportedtimetoweightbearingwasre-
corded. Ankle range of motion (plantar and dorsiflexion) was
measured with a standardized handheld goniometer.16 Mobil-
ity was measured at 6 months with the Timed Up and Go test
(walkingdistance,8.6m).17Fracturenonunionandmalunionat
6 months was assessed with anteroposterior or mortise and lat-
eral radiographs collected during the course of routine prac-
tice. Radiographs were analyzed at Oxford University by 2 ex-
perienced orthopedic surgeons (K.W. and R.H.). Assessors had
no access to clinical data or patient reports. Malunion was de-
fined as one or a combination of the following: talar sublux-
ationorshift(>2mm),talartilt(>2°),ordiastasis(tibiofibularclear
space≥5mm).Nonunionwasassessedforlateralandmedialmal-
leoli. Absolute measures corrected for magnification were ob-
tained when there were Digital Imaging and Communications
in Medicine data, which included the majority of images.
Expected complications, harms, or additional surgery re-
lated to study treatments were recorded as adverse events, in-
cluding operative complications; wound, implant, and cast
complications; venous thromboembolism; and additional pro-
cedures, including implant removal. In addition, unexpected
adverse events were reported. Serious adverse events were de-
fined as any untoward medical occurrence that was both un-
expected and related to the study treatments, resulting in
death, life- or limb-threatening complication, and/or rehospi-
talization. Treatment relatedness was determined by sur-
geons at sites and confirmed by the chief investigator. We es-
timatedcostsoftheprocedures,includingtimeintheoperating
room, staff, facilities, implants, materials, and acute and com-
munity care costs linked to the admission. Additional health
resource use was captured in patient-reported question-
naires at 6 weeks and 6 months. A cost-effectiveness analysis
will be reported separately.
At baseline, we collected data on demographic and clinical
characteristics.Participantswereaskedtorecalltheirstatusbe-
fore fracture with questionnaires used during follow-up and to
complete the EQ-5D on the day of assessment. The ASEPSIS
woundscore(Additionaltreatment,Serousdischarge,Erythema,
Purulentexudate,Separationofthedeeptissues,Isolationofbac-
teria, duration of inpatient Stay)18 at 10 days after surgery, de-
scribed in the first version of the protocol, was not collected af-
ter an amendment approved by the ethics committee.
Statistical Analysis
The sample size of 620 provided 80% power to perform tests
of an equivalence margin of ±6 OMAS points, at α = .05 and al-
lowing 10% loss to follow-up. Estimates of the standard devia-
tion were confirmed from a single-site pilot phase (n = 95; SD
16.2OMASpointsintheoperativegroup).Thedesignwasmodi-
fied between pilot and full trial from a noninferiority design
using a binary end point to an equivalence design using a con-
tinuouslyscaledequivalencemargin.Thismodificationwasnot
based on analysis of data but was in response to guidance from
theindependentfunder,funderpeerreview,independentsteer-
ing and data and safety monitoring committees, and advances
inacceptedapproachestoequivalencetrialdesign.19Thechoice
of equivalence margin was informed by a multidisciplinary ex-
pert panel and, in the absence of better evidence, a review of
minimumclinicallyimportantdifferencesforsimilarscores.The
6-pointmarginwasconsistentwiththeminimumclinicallyim-
portant differences reported in a recent psychometric evalua-
tion of the OMAS, which also confirmed other psychometric
properties of the score sufficient for use as an outcome mea-
sure in ankle fracture trials.20 The participants from the pilot
phase were included in the final sample because the full trial
protocol was otherwise modified only by adding cost-
effectivenessoutcomes.Weperformedasensitivityanalysisby

The primary analysis was per protocol,21 in which only the
datafrompatientswhoreceivedtheirallocatedtreatmentwere
analyzed. If the allocated treatment was received but a sec-
ond intervention was required, provided this was a prespeci-
fied allowable event, these participants remained in the per-
protocol analysis. An intention-to-treat analysis including all
randomized participants was also conducted, aiming to dem-

els to estimate the mean difference and 95% CI between treat-
ments adjusted for age, sex, fracture pattern, and baseline
score. The center variable was included in this model as a ran-
dom effect to account for center differences. Categorical out-
comes were analyzed with logistic regression models to esti-
mate the odds ratio and 95% CI. When data were not normally
distributed, we used Hodges-Lehmann and Fisher exact tests
for continuous and categorical variables, respectively.
Only the primary analyses assessed equivalence, in which
the null hypothesis was that the 2 groups were not equiva-
lent. The alternative hypothesis was therefore that the treat-
ment groups were equivalent (ie, the 95% CIs were totally
within the equivalence margin), so if the P value was signifi-
cant (P < .05), the conclusion was that there was significant
evidence to suggest that the 2 treatments were equivalent. Ac-
cording to CONSORT and other groups, secondary outcomes
can be managed by a superiority or equivalence framework.22
We assessed secondary end points with a superiority hypoth-
esis rather than an equivalence because this technique, rec-
ognized as legitimate, avoided the need to set multiple equiva-
lence margins when such margins were not available.
Superioritytestingisalsomorestatisticallyefficient,whichwas
an important consideration for this trial. Sensitivity analyses
using multiple imputation techniques to assess the effect of
missing data were planned. It is well recognized that surgical
techniques can take some time to learn and that the number

of procedures undertaken can be important in determining
outcome.23 Learning curves were assessed with a longitudi-
nal random model. For each surgeon, operation time was or-
dered sequentially by date, and a time variable was created.
This time variable was fitted as a random effect into a longi-
tudinal model, with the operation time as the response vari-
able. The surgeon was included as a random effect. All tests
were 2-sided at the 5% significance level. Secondary end point
analyses should be considered exploratory because they were
not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Analyses were con-
ducted with Stata version 13.1 and SAS version 9.3.
Results
Recruitment to the pilot study started in May 2004, moving to
themulticenterphasefromJuly2010toNovember2013.Atotal
of 2015 patients were assessed for eligibility; 671 were eligible
and 620 consented to randomization (Figure and eTable 1 in
Supplement 2). Baseline characteristics were well matched be-
tween groups (Table 1). Participants were aged an average of
71 years, and 460 of 620 (74%) were women. Ankle fractures
were trans-syndesmotic or infrasyndesmotic (542/620; 87%)
and suprasyndesmotic (78/620; 13%). Six-month assessments
wereconductedmostlyinclinic(572/593;97%).Follow-updata
were obtained for 593 of 620 participants (96%) at 6 months;
the remainder had been lost to follow-up (2/620; 0.3%), had
withdrawn(15/620;2%),orhaddied(10/620;2%).Analysesin-
cluded 90% of participants (558/620) for per protocol and 96%
(593/620) for intention to treat.
The majority of participants (579/620; 93%) received al-
located treatment. In the casting arm, 34 of 620 participants
(6%) did not receive the casting and so were not included in
the per-protocol analysis. Of these participants, 17 proceeded
to internal fixation surgery, 1 received external fixation sur-
gery, 5 had traditional casting, 6 had an alternative form
of casting, and 5 withdrew before receiving treatment. In the
surgery arm, 7 of 620 participants (1%) did not receive inter-
nal fixation and so were not in the per-protocol analysis. Of
these participants, 4 received casting against protocol and 3
received another form of casting. The remainder of partici-
pants received their treatment per protocol, including 13
of 298 (4%) who received a temporary treatment before sur-
gery and 2 of 275 (0.7%) who received one before close con-
tact casting.
For participants in the casting arm who received treat-
ment according to allocation, later loss of fracture reduction
resulted in conversion to internal fixation for 52 of 275 (19%)
or remanipulation and casting applied in the operating room
for 10 of 275 (4%). These events in the weeks after initial cast-
ingapplicationwereallowableandexpectedaspartoftheclose

6 months was –0.6 OMAS points (95% CI, –3.9 to 2.6; P = .001).
In the intention-to-treat analysis (eTable 3 in Supplement 2),
the mean difference was –0.2 OMAS points (95% CI, –3.3 to 2.9;
P < .001). A post hoc analysis was performed in which partici-
pants who did not receive their allocated casting interven-
tion but received surgery instead were included in the sur-
gery group; there was no difference between groups (mean
difference, –0.7 OMAS points; 95% CI, –3.84 to 2.42; P = .66).
Sensitivity analyses using imputation were not conducted be-
causemissingdatawereminimal.Fortheprimaryoutcomeand

sis. Inclusion of participants from the pilot study did not in-
troduce bias in the primary per-protocol analysis; the treat-
menteffectestimatewasunchangedandthepilotmembership
indicator in the model was not significant (P = .71). The James
blinding index was 0.8 (95% CI, 0.78-0.84).
Table 2 shows data for secondary outcomes. There were
no differences between the secondary outcomes of quality of
life (mental and physical), ankle pain, and patient satisfac-
tion at either 6 weeks or 6 months. The Timed Up and Go mo-
bility test score was only completed at 6 months. There were
small differences in ankle motion at 6 weeks (eTable 2 in
Supplement 2), but no differences at 6 months.
Six-month radiographs were missing for 24 of 298 partici-
pants (8%) in the surgery group and 26 of 275 (10%) in the cast-
ing group. Radiologic malleolar nonunion was low overall and
lower in the surgery group compared with casting for the lat-
eral malleolus (data were missing for 1 participant: 0/274 vs
8/248; 3%) and medial malleolus (3/274 vs 18/248 [1% vs 7%]),
yieldinganoddsratioof0.1(95%CI,0.04-0.5).Radiologicmal-
union occurred in 38 of 249 participants (15%) in the casting
group compared with 8 of 274 (3%) in the surgery group, yield-
ing an odds ratio of 6.0 (95% CI, 2.8-12.9). The most disabling
form of malunion was a combination of talar shift, tilt, and a
diastasis. There were few cases of this type of malunion, and
these were equally spread between the trial groups (eTable 4
in Supplement 2).
Adverse events are detailed in Table 3. There were no un-
expected,treatment-related,seriousadverseevents.Thenum-
berofparticipantswhoexperiencedaninfectionand/orwound
breakdown in those with follow-up data available for the sur-
gery group was 29 of 298 (10%) compared with 4 of 275 (1%)
for close contact casting, yielding an odds ratio of 7.3 (95% CI,
2.6-20.2). eTable 4 in Supplement 2 shows OMAS scores at 6
months for these participants. The number of additional op-
erating room procedures for treatment-related complica-
tions was 18 of 298 participants (6%) in the surgery group and
3of275(1%)intheclosecontactcastinggroup,yieldinganodds
ratio of 5.8 (95% CI, 1.8-18.7).
Resource use for the interventions is shown in eTable 5 in
Supplement 2. Casting resulted in a meaningful mean reduc-
tion in overall operating room time and implant use and small
increases in casts, orthopedic outpatient or office consulta-
tions, and hospital transport use. There was no difference in
length of hospital stay or time to weight bearing. There were
no differences in other aspects of health resource use during
the follow-up period.
Clinical outcomes and resource use were consistent be-
tween the per-protocol and intention-to-treat populations
(Tables 2 and 3; eTables 2, 3, and 6-9 in Supplement 2).
Discussion
In older adults with unstable ankle fractures, a strategy of
commencing fracture management with close contact cast-
ing resulted in ankle function equivalent to that with imme-
diate surgery, with fewer wound complications and reduced
intervention costs. Close contact casting was delivered suc-
cessfully for most participants, substantially reducing the
number of patients requiring invasive surgical procedures at
the outset and additional operations during a 6-month pe-
riod. These findings are strengthened by consistency be-
tween per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses, excel-
lentretentionofparticipantsduringfollow-up,minimalmissing
data,arobustscientificdesign,andadequatenumbersofstudy
participants.
In recent decades, orthopedic surgical practice has fa-
vored open surgical implant fixation of fractures of the ankle
to restore exact joint congruence. This approach is consid-
ered to improve outcomes and reduce postinjury arthritis.

However, in older patients with lower demand, shorter life ex-
pectancy, lesser bone and tissue quality, and diminished ca-
pacity for healing, the rates of delayed or infected wound heal-
ing and loss of implant fixation become greater. More
complicated types of clinical presentation were not included
in the study sample, in which abnormalities of skin and risk
of infection were substantially greater. Previous research has
demonstrated the effectiveness of contact casting for man-
agement of significant skin ulceration in diabetes and related
conditions.24 The sample was consistent with the age, sex rep-
resentations,andlevelsofdisabilityofclinicalpopulationsand
samples in other trials.7,25,26 There were higher rates of radio-
logicmalunionwithclosecontactcasting,indicatingthatmain-
taining position was more difficult. The overall equivalence in
clinical outcome, however, challenges the importance of re-
storingexactjointcongruenceinolderadultsandsuggeststhat
function and pain are not as closely related to malunion as
many clinicians believe. Alternatively, the grades or types of
malunion observed after close contact casting may be of little
functional significance.
The evidence base for nonsurgical fracture management
is limited. To our knowledge, this clinical trial is the first to re-
port the effectiveness of close contact casting for this indica-
tion. The findings are consistent with a recent smaller trial of
younger persons with similar injuries that compared tradi-
tional casting techniques and surgery and reported no func-
tional differences but more malunion with casting.27
This was a pragmatic trial recruiting from major trauma
centersandsmallerdistricthospitalsfollowingtheirusualprac-
tices for assessment and management. The trial protocol al-
lowed aspects of care, except the intervention, to continue un-
changed and enabled the results to be generalizable to a range
of settings. The design allowed for different decisions being
made in the operating room, as is the case in everyday prac-
tice. The results represent a well-controlled comparison of the
2 intervention strategies of starting fracture management with
surgery or casting.
Limitations have to be recognized. Longer-term out-
comes would have yielded greater certainty of the safety and
effectiveness of treatment, particularly the development of
posttraumatic osteoarthritis. However, the weight of evi-
dence showed that physical function at 6 months was a ro-
bust intermediary measure for long-term outcome.28 There is
a fundamental uncertainty about causative factors of post-
traumatic osteoarthritis. The limited published evidence im-
plicates direct damage caused by the initial trauma, compli-
cations, and patient-related factors rather than joint alignment
during the fracture reduction.29-31 A learning curve was not
identified for close contact casting, but this might have been
difficult to detect, given the limited number of close contact
castingproceduresconductedbyeachsurgeonduringthetrial.
There were a large number of secondary analyses, and al-
though they should be considered exploratory, all are consis-
tent in direction and nature.
Conclusions
Among older adults with unstable ankle fracture, the use of
close contact casting compared with surgery resulted in simi-
larfunctionaloutcomesat6months.Closecontactcastingmay
be an appropriate treatment for such patients.
