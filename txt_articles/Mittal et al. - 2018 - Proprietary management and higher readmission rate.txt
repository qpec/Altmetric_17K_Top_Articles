Abstract
Introduction
Reducing preventable readmissions among Medicare beneficiaries is an effective way to
not only reduce the exorbitantly rising cost in healthcare but also as a measure to improve
the quality of patient care. Many of the previous efforts in reducing readmission rate of
patients have not been very successful because of ill-defined quality measures, improper
data collection methods and lack of effective strategies based on data driven solutions.
Methods
In this study, we analyzed the readmission data of patients for six major diseases including
acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure (HF), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG),
pneumonia (PN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and total hip arthroplasty
and/or total knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA) from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Read-
missions Reduction Program (HRRP) program for the period 2012–2015 in context with the
ownership structure of the hospitals.
Results
Our analysis demonstrates that the readmission rates of patients were statistically higher in
proprietary (for profit) hospitals compared to the government and non-profit hospitals which
was independent of their geographical distribution across all six major diseases.
Conclusion
This finding we believe has strong implications for policy makers to mitigate any potential
risks in the quality of patient care arising from unintended revenue pressure in healthcare
institutions.

 Introduction
Reducing preventable readmissions among Medicare patients has become an important
national priority for healthcare policy makers. From the Medicare Payment Advisory Com-
mission (MedPAC) report, almost one-fifth of Medicare beneficiaries discharged are readmit-
ted within 30 days [1]. The majority of hospital readmissions fall in four big categories
including: 1) postoperative surgical complications; 2) improper discharge care of patients; 3)
reoccurrence of chronic conditions such as COPD or heart failure; and 4) patient’s error in
medication adherence [2]. A 2014 report identified that 10–50% of all the readmissions are
potentially preventable readmissions and cost Medicare $17.4 billion annually [3]. The heart
failure and COPD patients have the highest readmission rate of 23%-26% among all the dis-
eases [3].
Depending on the delivery of healthcare services, there are three main business models of
providers including government, proprietary (for-profit), and non-profit [4]. The government
healthcare institutions deliver healthcare services mostly from public funding, whereas the
proprietary hospitals are owned by investors and shareholders who have self-financial interest
and most of the profits from the proprietary hospital is distributed among them. The non-
profit hospitals may be owned by the members of the organization, communities, regional
health authorities, or a hospital trust. These owners do not derive any profits and the main
purpose of non-profit hospitals is to provide healthcare services and maintain socio-economic
stability within the organization. The non-profit hospital’s surplus profits may be invested in
the research or teaching activities depending upon the goals and the mission of the organiza-
tion. [4].
Previous studies in the literature have focused on the causative factors of patient readmis-
sion such as socio-economic factors or hospital-level care processes to reduce the readmissions
rate [5–7]. The ownership structure of providers, however, has recently emerged as another
crucial paradigm governing the readmission risk among hospitalized patients [4]. Notably,
non-profit health care institutions have been shown to provide better quality of patient care
than for-profit health care institutions in multiple studies [8–12]. Some studies, in contrary,
have shown better patient outcomes in for-profit institutions [13,14]. However, little research
has been done to report how the ownership structure of hospital operation impacts the read-
mission rates of the patients in different disease categories. In this study, we analyzed the read-
mission ratio from Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) database for 2012–2015
for six major disease categories including acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure
(HF), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), pneumonia (PN), chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD), and total hip arthroplasty and/or total knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA), in con-
text of the ownership structure of the providers nationwide.
Methods
Data on readmission ratios from 14,307 disease specific hospital reports was obtained from the
national Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) from 2012–2015 for six major dis-
eases: AMI, HF, CABG, PN, COPD, and THA/TKA (Data sets 2017). Hospital ownership type
was sourced from a Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services report (i.e. government, pro-
prietary or non-profit by Provider Identifier) [15]. Using the provider identifier in both HRRP
and the ownership file, the two data sets were mapped together. The calculations of the excess
readmission ratio are based on the methodology used for the calculation of the CMS 30-day
risk standardized readmission measures for the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program
as described in the instructions for HRRP database [15]. A readmission ratio less than 1 is con-
sidered good, where a ratio greater than one implies excess readmission controlled for disease

 severity. The readmission ratio was categorized into 4 intervals: <0.8, 0.8–0.99, 1.0–1.2 and
>1.2 for each disease. Hospital ownership was additionally used to analyze the readmission
ratios by focusing on the percentage of hospitals in each ratio category (Fig 1A). Readmission
ratio of less <1 (Green Zone) was defined as a hospital having fewer readmissions than
expected after adjustment for patient disease severity for the individual hospital. Hospitals
with >1.0 (Red Zone) was defined as having more readmissions than expected. A Fischer
exact analysis was conducted to calculate statistically significant differences between the
groups of ownership and additionally the readmission ratios were graphed for each disease
and ownership type by whisker-box plot. A list of the top and bottom 10 hospitals based on

 readmission ratio for all six major diseases was created. The readmission ratio of various hos-
pitals according to the ownership was also mapped to their geographical location using Tab-
leau 10.5.
Results
From the Fisher Exact analysis, we found a statistically significant difference between hospital
ownership in readmission ratio among all six major diseases (all p < .0001, Fig 1A). The Green
Zone (readmission ratio < 1) was predominated by government and non-profit hospitals com-
pared to their proprietary counterparts (Fig 1A). In contrast, the Red Zone (readmission
ratio > 1) was predominated by proprietary hospitals for all six major diseases (Fig 1A). As
illustrated in Fig 1B, the median and mean readmission ratio was highest for proprietary hos-
pitals for all six diseases (all p < .001). In the top 10 hospital readmission ratio rankings, the
government and non-profit hospitals predominated the list for HF, AMI, COPD, and CABG
while proprietary hospitals were only included in the topmost ranking only for THA/TKA and
PN (Fig 2) (7 Government, 44 non-profits, 9 proprietary). When examining the bottom 10
hospital readmission ratios across all 6 diseases for 60 hospitals; proprietary hospital have a
large percentage of membership in this list 28% versus 15%. The breakdown is 6 Government,
37 non-profits, 17 proprietary. We next examined the overall geographical distribution of gov-
ernment, non-profits, and for-profit hospitals based on their readmission score. All three cate-
gories of hospitals were uniformly distributed geographically across United States irrespective
of their readmission ratio indicating that the differences in quality of care between govern-
ment, non-profits, and for-profit hospitals does not relate to their geographical location
(Fig 3).
Discussion
The current study has identified that the government and non-profit hospitals have statistically
significant lower readmission ratios compared to the proprietary hospitals for all six major dis-
eases. With the rising cost of the healthcare services, an important priority before healthcare
policy makers is how to reduce the cost of healthcare services without compromising the safety
of patients. Readmissions cost the healthcare system monetary penalties, but a larger concern
to patients are the missed days or weeks with family and friends when they would otherwise be
outside of the hospital.
Multiple studies have shown that ownership structure of Health Care organizations
(HCOs) affect the performance of providers and patient outcomes [7–14]. While hospitals are
different than many other HCO’s, we compare the literature to other HCO as few studies on
HCO ownership have been published. Similar to our study, Horwitz et al. have reported higher
readmission rates for patients at for-profit hospitals among the 4474 hospitals analyzed for
Medicare beneficiaries from July 2013-July 2014 [16]. Daras et al. have reported higher read-
mission rate for rehabilitation patients in the for-profit IRFs (Inpatient Rehabilitation Facili-
ties) than the non-profit IRFs [8]. Although, the authors also reported geographical variation
in their study with more readmission rates in IRFs in the South Atlantic and South Central
regions than the New England, these readmissions were related to all cause-unplanned popula-
tion which may have different mix of patients than what was observed in this study [8]. In
another study, Devereaux et al. performed the meta-analysis of published and unpublished
observational studies from 1973 to 1997, to compare the mortality rate of patients in for-profit
vs not-for-profit dialysis centers, and reported significantly higher mortality risk associated
with for-profit dialysis centers [9]. Another meta-analysis study based on 82 articles, per-
formed by Comondore et al., from 1965–2003, reported higher quality of care in non-profit

 nursing homes compared to the for-profit facilities [10]. The non-profit nursing homes were
associated with higher quality staffing and lower pressure ulcer prevalence compared to the
for-profit nursing homes [10]. Hillmer et al. similarly reported better quality of care associated
with non-profit nursing homes using qualitative systematic review of 38 studies from 1990–
2002 [11]. Rosenau et al. reported that non-profits were judged 59% of the time superior,

 whereas for-profits were judged to be superior only 12% of the time [12]. Their study was
based on the systematic review of two decades of articles published since 1980–2003 [12].
Some of the studies, however, have reported better care quality in for-profit institutions [13–
14]. Leleu et al., for instance, have shown reduced readmission in for-profit teaching and fully
integrated hospitals than their counterparts [13]. Akintoye et al., have reported reduced mor-
tality in for-profit hospitals among HF patient from 2013–2014 nationwide [14]. There could
be multiple reasons ascribed to this discrepancy such as specificity to a particular disease cate-
gory, temporal differences or use of different database.
The analysis of readmission ratio reported in this study is based on the most current data
set available yet since the start of the HRRP program in 2012. One additional caveat to read-
mission is a recently published study by Fonarow et al. showing that a reduction of readmis-
sion rate in HF patients, after HRRP implementation, was accompanied by a concomitant rise
in the risk adjusted mortality rate [17]. Due to the nature of the government reported HRRP
data, this new risk is unable to be assessed but requires further research in the future.
The Center for Healthcare Quality and Policy Reform (CHQPR) has suggested five basic
approached to payment reform [18]: 1) Don’t pay providers for readmissions, 2) Provide
incentive to providers to implement programs to reduce readmissions, 3) Pay providers
bonuses/incentives based on readmission rates, 4) Don’t pay provider for readmissions meet-
ing specific criteria, and 5) Make patient care comprehensive regardless of number of hospital-
izations and readmissions. The larger concern from a policy perspective is why proprietary
hospitals have such a different readmission ratio than their other counterparts. The relatively
lack of resources at proprietary HCOs due to higher taxes and focus on maximizing the return
on investment may lead to recruitment of less qualified staff or less investment in medical
technology resulting in inferior quality of care than the government or non-profit institutions
[4]. With the shrinking revenues in healthcare market and a move towards the value based
payment system, the particular aspect of provider ownership on delivery of healthcare services
is becoming more crucial. The policy makers need to carefully evaluate and design healthcare
policies that mitigate potential risks associated with unintended revenue pressure in harming
patients.
Strengths and limitations
The major strengths of this study is that the findings described herein are based on nationally
available HRRP database that includes all of the hospitals with the associated illness, currently
operating across the United States. Due to the unrestricted availability of this publicly reported
Fig 3. A geographical mapping of hospital readmission ratio results in three different panels by hospital type, Government, Proprietary, Non-Profit.

 data, the results of the study can be independently investigated and reproduced by any
research group working in this field. Another major strength of this study is that the HRRP
database includes readmission ratio which is normalized based on the severity of illness of the
patients treated in the hospital. The major limitations of this study is that the data are derived
and limited by the accuracy of the disease severity adjustment. Another limitation is the accu-
rate categorization of hospitals in different ownership types, this study is reliant on the proper
categorization by the government. The final limitation in this study is that we only examine six
disease categories collected by the government. The readmission ratio has not been calculated
for all admissions to a hospital and different diseases could have different ratios.
Conclusions
The underperformance of proprietary (for-profit) hospitals in the current study may be associ-
ated with several factors including stakeholder’s expectations for operating profits; different
patient insurance portfolios; limitations of the HRRP disease adjustment; or other factors. As
heath care markets continue becoming more consolidated, it is critical to conduct additional
study to understand the impact of provider ownership on patient outcomes.
