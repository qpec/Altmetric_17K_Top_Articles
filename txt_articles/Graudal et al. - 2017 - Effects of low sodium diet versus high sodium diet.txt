Background
In spite of more than 100 years of investigations the question of whether a reduced sodium intake improves health is still unsolved.
Objectives
To estimate the effects of low sodium intake versus high sodium intake on systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), plasma
or serum levels of renin, aldosterone, catecholamines, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and
triglycerides.
Search methods
The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to March
2016: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2016, Issue
3), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and
ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles.
Selection criteria
Studies randomising persons to low-sodium and high-sodium diets were included if they evaluated at least one of the above outcome
parameters.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently collected data, which were analysed with Review Manager 5.3.
Main results
A total of 185 studies were included. The average sodium intake was reduced from 201 mmol/day (corresponding to high usual level)
to 66 mmol/day (corresponding to the recommended level).

 The effect of sodium reduction on blood pressure (BP) was as follows: white people with normotension: SBP: mean difference (MD)
-1.09 mmHg (95% confidence interval (CI): -1.63 to -0.56; P = 0.0001); 89 studies, 8569 participants; DBP: + 0.03 mmHg (MD
95% CI: -0.37 to 0.43; P = 0.89); 90 studies, 8833 participants. High-quality evidence.
Black people with normotension: SBP: MD -4.02 mmHg (95% CI:-7.37 to -0.68; P = 0.002); seven studies, 506 participants; DBP:
MD -2.01 mmHg (95% CI:-4.37 to 0.35; P = 0.09); seven studies, 506 participants. Moderate-quality evidence.
Asian people with normotension: SBP: MD -0.72 mmHg (95% CI: -3.86 to 2.41; P = 0.65); DBP: MD -1.63 mmHg (95% CI:-3.35
to 0.08; P =0.06); three studies, 393 participants. Moderate-quality evidence.
White people with hypertension: SBP: MD -5.51 mmHg (95% CI: -6.45 to -4.57; P < 0.00001); 84 studies, 5925 participants; DBP:
MD -2.88 mmHg (95% CI: -3.44 to -2.32; P < 0.00001); 85 studies, 6001 participants. High-quality evidence.
Black people with hypertension: SBP MD -6.64 mmHg (95% CI:-9.00 to -4.27; P = 0.00001); eight studies, 619 participants; DBP
-2.91 mmHg (95% CI:-4.52, -1.30; P = 0.0004); eight studies, 619 participants. Moderate-quality evidence.
Asian people with hypertension: SBP: MD -7.75 mmHg (95% CI:-11,44 to -4.07; P < 0.0001) nine studies, 501 participants; DBP:
MD -2.68 mmHg (95% CI: -4.21 to -1.15; P = 0.0006). Moderate-quality evidence.
In plasma or serum, there was a significant increase in renin (P < 0.00001), aldosterone (P < 0.00001), noradrenaline (P < 0.00001),
adrenaline (P < 0.03), cholesterol (P < 0.0005) and triglyceride (P < 0.0006) with low sodium intake as compared with high sodium
intake. All effects were stable in 125 study populations with a sodium intake below 250 mmol/day and a sodium reduction intervention
of at least one week.
Authors’ conclusions
Sodium reduction from an average high usual sodium intake level (201 mmol/day) to an average level of 66 mmol/day, which is below
the recommended upper level of 100 mmol/day (5.8 g salt), resulted in a decrease in SBP/DBP of 1/0 mmHg in white participants
with normotension and a decrease in SBP/DBP of 5.5/2.9 mmHg in white participants with hypertension. A few studies showed that
these effects in black and Asian populations were greater. The effects on hormones and lipids were similar in people with normotension
and hypertension. Renin increased 1.60 ng/mL/hour (55%); aldosterone increased 97.81 pg/mL (127%); adrenalin increased 7.55 pg/
mL (14%); noradrenalin increased 63.56 pg/mL: (27%); cholesterol increased 5.59 mg/dL (2.9%); triglyceride increased 7.04 mg/dL
(6.3%).

The effect of a low salt diet on blood pressure and some hormones and lipids in people with normal and elevated blood pressure
Review question
Studies in which participants were distributed by chance into groups with high and low salt intake were analysed to investigate the
effect of reduced salt intake on blood pressure (BP) and potential side effects of sodium reduction on some hormones and lipids.
Background
As a reduction in salt intake decreases blood pressure (BP) in individuals with elevated BP
, we are commonly advised to cut down on
salt. However, the effect of salt reduction on BP in people with a normal BP has been questioned. Furthermore, several studies have
shown that salt reduction activates the salt conserving hormonal system (renin and aldosterone), the stress hormones (adrenalin and
noradrenalin) and increases fatty substances (cholesterol and triglyceride) in the blood.
Search date
The present evidence is current to April 2016.
Study characteristics
One hundred and eighty-five intervention studies of 12,210 individuals lasting four to 1100 days were included, which evaluated at
least one of the effect measures. Participants were healthy or had elevated blood pressure. Longitudinal studies have shown that the
effect of reduced salt intake on BP is stable after at maximum seven days and population studies have shown that very few people eat

 more than 14.5 g salt per day. Therefore, we also perfomed subgroup sub-analyses of 125 studies with a duration of at least seven days
and a salt intake of maximum 14.5 g.
Study funding sources
Forty-four studies did not mention support. One hundred and twenty-two studies were supported by public foundations. Twelve
studies were supported by the pharmaceutical industry and one study by an electronic company. Six studies were supported by food
industry organisations.
Key results
The mean dietary sodium intake was reduced from 11.5 g per day to 3.8 g per day. The reduction in SBP/DBP in people with
normotension was about 1/0 mmHg, and in people with hypertension about 5.5/2.9 mmHg. In contrast, the effect on hormones and
lipids were similar in people with normotension and hypertension. Renin increased 1.60 ng/mL/hour (55%); aldosterone increased
97.81 pg/mL (127%); adrenalin increased 7.55 pg/mL (14%); noradrenalin increased 63.56 pg/mL (27%); cholesterol increased 5.59
mg/dL (2.9%); triglyceride increased 7.04 mg/dL (6.3%).
Quality of evidence
Only randomised controlled trials were included and the basic grade of evidence was therefore considered to be high, although the
grade of evidence was downgraded in some of the smaller analyses. In general, the description of the randomisation procedure was
insufficient, introducing a bias which could exaggerate the effects, but many of the studies were published in a period where it was not
customary to report such descriptions. The majority of studies were open, but the outcomes of these did not differ from the outcomes
of the double-blind studies. Almost all individual studies of participants with normal blood pressure (BP) show no significant effect of
sodium reduction on BP
, whereas a large number of studies in people with hypertension did show significant effect of sodium reduction
on BP
. Thus, there was a high grade of consistency between the outcomes of the individual studies and the outcomes of the meta-
analyses. Sensitivity analyses of studies lasting at least one week (the time of maximal efficacy) confirmed the primary analyses. Finally,
the impact of commercial interests on the outcomes was negligible.

Description of the condition
Some health institutions (WHO 2012), and dietary recommen-
dations (ADG 2015), assume that reduction in salt intake from
“high” to “low” levels is associated with reduction in systolic and
diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), which might result in a
decrease in mortality. However, the definitions of “high”, “normal”
and “low” sodium intake are unclear. The present usual sodium
intake indicates that an intake in the interval 109 mmol/day to
209 mmol/day (McCarron 2013; Powles 2013, Table 1) would be
“normal”, ahigh sodiumintake wouldbe above 209mmol/dayand
a low sodium intake would be below 109 mmol/day, but according
to the health institutions a “normal” sodium intake is below 100
mmol/day (ADG 2015), or below 87 mmol/day (WHO 2012),
and a sodium intake above 100 mmol/day is “high”, whereas a
“low” sodium intake is not defined. The confusion is strength-
ened by the use of different terms to describe salt (salt (sodium
chloride) and sodium) and different units for salt/sodium intake
(mg/day or mmol/day). To reduce the confusion we have shown
the different definitions and units for salt and sodium intake in
Table 1. In the present review, which represents a third update of
the first meta-analysis that includes an analysis of hormones and
lipids in addition to blood pressure (Graudal 1998), updated in
2003 (Jürgens 2003) and 2011 (Graudal 2011), we use the term
“sodium” and the unit “mmol”.
Blood pressure is associated with mortality (Collins 1990).The hy-
pothesis that a reduced sodium intake (sodium reduction) will re-
duce blood pressure (BP) and subsequently reduce morbidity and
mortality was raised in 1904 on the basis of individual patient cases
(Ambard 1904). Subsequently in 1907, these results were opposed
(Löwenstein 1907). The clinical and physiological effects of salt
published in studies during the first half of the 20th century were
reviewed in 1949 (Chapman 1949). Consequently, scientific stud-
ies have been performed for almost 70 years before modern stan-
dard scientific randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (1000 Parijs
1973) and observational studies (Kagan 1985) were performed
in humans. However, these scientific studies are interpreted dif-
ferently (Taubes 1998, Graudal 2005, Bayer 2012). While health
institutions (ADG 2015, WHO 2012) support sodium reduction
below100mmol/dayscepticshave claimedthatthisrecommended
upper limit (UL) for sodium intake is based on a biased selec-
tion of evidence (Folkow 2011), and is inconsistent with Institute
of Medicine’s definition of an adequate nutrient intake, which is
“the approximate intake found in apparently healthy populations“
(IOM 2006; Heaney 2013). For sodium ”the approximate intake
in apparently healthy populations“ is between 90 mmol/day and
248 mmol/day (Table 1).
The present Cochrane review is based on a meta-analysis published
in 1998 (Graudal 1998). In 1998, the usual sodium intake was
known in some populations, but it was not well-defined worldwide
until recently (Table 1). The present upper level of 100 mmol/day
was defined in 2005 (IOM 2005). Furthermore, the significance
of the duration of sodium reduction was not established. In 1998,
we therefore included all available randomised studies, irrespec-
tive of sodium intake and duration of intervention, assuming that
the average values of multiple studies would be relevant for the
general population. We separated study populations in a group of
populations with normal BP to investigate the potential effect of
sodium reduction in the general population and in a group of hy-
pertensive populations to investigate the potential effect of sodium
reduction as a treatment for hypertensive individuals. In a cross-
sectional multiple regression analysis including many covariates
we found that the duration of the sodium reduction intervention
had no impact on the effect of sodium reduction on BP (Graudal
1998). In addition to this cross-sectional meta-regression analysis,
a recent meta-analysis of longitudinal studies measuring the BP-
effect of sodium reduction several times during the observation
period showed that there was no difference in SBP effect or DBP
effect between week one and week six, thus estimating the time
point for maximal efficacy to be at maximum at one week (Graudal
2015). These results are shown in Table 2. In the Graudal 1998
analysis, the average sodium intake in the non-reduced group was
203 mmol/day and in the reduced group it was 62 mmol/day. In
the two following updates of the review, the corresponding sodium
reductions were from 205 mmol/day to 64 mmol/day (Jürgens
2003) and from 202 mmol/day to 67 mmol/day (Graudal 2011).
We now know (McCarron 2013; Powles 2013) that this reduction
corresponds to a reduction from a high usual level to the present
recommended levels (defined in 2005 (IOM 2005) and in 2012
(WHO 2012) i.e. the present review is relevant in the context of
evaluating the consequences of the present recommendations to
reduce sodium intake to a level below 100 mmol/day.
Description of the intervention
As in the previous meta-analyses, RCTs are included, which al-
locate participants to two diets with a different content of salt
(sodium chloride) or to either salt tablets or placebo tablets. The
compliance in the RCTs is ensured by measurement of sodium
excretion in the urine, which is accepted to be a reliable surrogate
for the measuring of sodium intake. The sodium content of the
“high” and “low” sodium diets were not defined according to the
recommendations or the usual sodium intake, but just to describe
the relative content of the two randomised study populations.
How the intervention might work
Extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) is determined by the balance
between sodium intake and renal excretion of sodium. A steady
state exists whereby sodium intake equals output, while ECFV is
expanded during salt loads and shrunken during salt restriction (

 Palmer2008). Thus, the idea behind sodium reduction is to shrink
ECFV in order to decrease BP
. The precondition for this idea is
that the smaller ECFV associated with the decrease in BP has no
counteracting effects on health outcomes that could outweigh the
BP-effect.
Why it is important to do this review
A verification of the hypothetical sodium-BP relationship would
support continuous attempts to lower sodium intake in order to re-
duce mortality. In this context it is important to define the correct
UL for a healthy sodium intake, which would have a significant
impact on the strategy to lower sodium intake. For instance if 100
mmol/day is the correct UL, more than 95% of the World’s pop-
ulations should reduce sodium intake, but if the UL is 250 mmol/
day, only about 5% should reduce sodium intake. In the latter
case, a strategy to lower sodium intake in the general population
would not be necessary, which would save significant efforts and
costs. The same would be the case if the sodium-BP relationship
could be denied, as indicated by many RCTs of participants with
normal BP (Graudal 2011). Worst case scenario is that sodium
reduction could lead to side effects, which might trump the po-
tential BP effect and result in increased mortality, as indicated by
longitudinal observational studies (Alderman 2010, Pfister 2014,
O’Donnell 2014, Graudal 2014; Mente 2016). Consequently, it
is important to investigate the effect of sodium reduction not only
on BP
, but also on potential surrogate markers for clinical side
effects.
O B J E C T I V E S
The purpose of the present review was to estimate the influence
of low- versus high-dietary sodium intake on systolic blood pres-
sure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and blood concen-
trations of renin, aldosterone, catecholamines, cholesterol, high-
density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and
triglyceride to contribute to the evaluation of the possible suitabil-
ity of sodium reduction as a prophylaxis initiative and treatment
of hypertension.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) allocating participants to di-
ets with different sodium contents, the lowest defined as “low”
and the highest defined as “high”, and in which the sodium intake
was estimated by the 24-hour urinary sodium excretion (either
measured on the basis of a 24-hour urine collection, or estimated
from a sample of at least eight hours).
Types of participants
Persons with normal or elevated blood pressure irrespective of race
and age were included. Studies systematically investigating un-
healthy patients with other diseases than elevated blood pressure,
for instance diabetes or heart failure, were excluded.
Types of interventions
The intervention was a change in sodium intake, the study popu-
lations randomly being divided into a group eating a “low” sodium
diet or a ”high“ sodium diet. As ”low“ and ”high“ were not specifi-
cally defined in relation to the usual intake or the definitions of the
health institutions (Table 1), both diets could contain any amount
of sodium, the assumption being that in most studies a ”low“
sodium diet would contain sodium within the low range (< 100
mmol)/day or usual range (100 mmol to 250 mmol/day) and the
“high” sodium diet would contain sodium within the usual range
(100 mmol to 250 mmol/day) or above the usual range (≥ 250
mmol/day). Confounding was not allowed, i.e. studies treating
persons with a concomitant intervention such as an antihyperten-
sive medication, potassium supplementation or weight reduction
were only included if the concomitant intervention was identical
during the low and the high-sodium diet.
Types of outcome measures
Outcome measures were effects on SBP
, DBP
, renin, aldos-
terone, adrenaline, noradrenaline, triglyceride, cholesterol, LDL
and HDL. In studies reporting BP only as mean arterial pressure
(MAP), SBP was estimated from SBP = 1.3 MAP + 1.4, and DBP
was estimated from DBP = 0.83 MAP - 0.7 (Tozawa 2002). Sep-
arate meta-analyses were performed for each outcome measure.
Concerning blood pressure, participants were stratified according
to ethnicity (Whites, Blacks and Asians) and according to level
of blood pressure (hypertension or normotension). Hypertension
was defined as SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg.
Study populations in which participants were treated with antihy-
pertensive treatment were defined as hypertensive irrespective of
baseline BP
. In studies that investigated different ethnicities and
different BP levels, the first priority was to separate these sub-
groups. If separate data were not given, the study data would be
analysed according to the biggest subgroup. Concerning all other
outcome variables, no stratifications were performed.
Primary outcomes
All outcomes were considered primary outcomes.

designed by Cochrane for identifying randomised controlled (as
described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
InterventionsVersion5.1.0, Box6.4.d. (Handbook2011)). Search
strategies for major databases are provided in Appendix 1.
Searching other resources
• The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist
searched the Hypertension Specialised Register segment (which
includes searches of MEDLINE for systematic reviews) to
retrieve existing systematic reviews relevant to this systematic
review, so that we could scan their reference lists for additional
trials.
• We checked the bibliographies of included studies and any
relevant systematic reviews identified for further references to
relevant trials.
• Where necessary, we contacted authors of key papers and
abstracts to request additional information about their trials.
Searches carried out for previous versions of this review
Trial search: Parijs and colleagues published the first RCT of the
effect of sodium reduction on BP in 1973 (1000 Parijs 1973).
In our first meta-analysis (Graudal 1998), a literature search in
MEDLINE (1966-through December 1997) was performed using
the following combinations of search terms: 1) salt or sodium,
2) restriction or dietary, 3) blood pressure or hypertension, 4)
randomized or random. We combined 1, 2, 3 and 4 and found
291 references. Of these, 76 randomised trials from 60 references
met the inclusion criteria. From the reference lists of these articles
and from four previous meta-analyses (Grobbee 1986, Law 1991,
Cutler1991, Midgley 1996), an additional 23 references reporting
on 39 trials were identified, resulting in a total of 83 references.
Similar searches were made for hormones and lipids changing the
third search term (blood pressure or hypertension) with the hor-
mone or lipid term resulting in additional five sub-studies dealing
with hormones and lipids (Jula-Karanko 1992, Jula-Mäki 1992
1026 Koolen 1984(2), 1104 Overlack 1993, Ruppert 1994). Of
these 88 references, three dealing exclusively with diabetes patients
were excluded in the 2003 update (Dodson 1989, Mühlhauser
1996, Miller 1997).
InJanuary2002, arepeatedsearch wasperformedthrough Decem-
ber 2001, revealing an additional 12 references, of which one was
excluded because it only included patients with diabetes (Imanishi
2001). Accordingly, the 2004 updated review included a total of
96 references.
In December 2009, a literature search for the 2011 update was
performed from 1950 through December 2009. This search re-
vealed a total of 511 references in Ovid MEDLINE, 282 in Ovid
EMBASE and 1428 in Cochrane CENTRAL. Headlines and ab-
stracts were read and 44 articles from MEDLINE (26 included),
eight from Embase (one included) and 129 from CENTRAL (45
included) were retrieved as full-text papers for further review. A
total of 72 new references investigating at least one of the effect
variables met the inclusion criteria for this review. The search was
not limited to English language studies. Two studies in Italian were
identified and included. During the present revision, we discov-
ered that in a few of the previously included studies, some sub-
group data were published in two papers. To avoid duplication
due to including subgroup data from several papers, we included
them from the main paper only. As a result, three previously in-
cluded references were excluded (Steegers 1991, Ruppert 1991,
Ruppert 1994). The most recent search was performed on July
21, 2011, revealing 293 additional references. After screening of
titles and abstracts, four full-text papers were retrieved, of which
two contained data to be included. Consequently a total of 167
studies were supposed to be included in the 2011 updated version
of this systematic review. However, in connection with the present
update, a recount revealed a counting error, as the number of ref-
erences in reality was 166.

 Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
See Search methods for identification of studies.
Review author NG performed the study selection for the 1998
version (Graudal 1998) and the 2003 version (Jürgens 2003). Re-
view authors NG and GJ independently performed the supple-
mentary study selection for the 2011 version (Graudal 2011. NG
and THG independently performed the supplementary study se-
lection for the current 2016 version. Discrepancies were resolved
by agreement.
Data extraction and management
Two authors independently recorded the following data from each
trial:
1. the sample size (N);
2. the mean age of participants;
3. the fraction of females, males; Whites, Blacks and Asians;
4. the duration of the intervention;
5. the sodium reduction measured as the difference between
24-hour urinary sodium excretion during low-sodium and high-
sodium diets and standard deviation (SD);
6. SBP (SD) and DBP (SD) before and after intervention;
7. difference between changes in SBP and DBP obtained
during low-sodium and high-sodium diets and the SD of these
differences;
8. for cross-over studies, when possible, the overall effect
estimate and standard error (SE);
9. levels of hormones and lipids in the blood and their
standard deviations during low-sodium and high-sodium diets.
Concerning lipids, cholesterol units of mmol/L were
transformed to mg/dL by means of the factor 38.6 and
triglyceride units of mmol/L were transformed to mg/dL by
means of the factor 88.4. Other renin units than ng/mL/hour
were when possible transformed to ng/mL/hour, and units of
aldosterone, noradrenalin and adrenalin other than pg/mL were
transformed to pg/mL by means of the molecular weights.
If there were discrepancies between review authors they looked at
the data together and came to an agreement.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
This was performed using the Cochrane ’Risk of bias’ tool, includ-
ing recording of allocation, blinding, incomplete outcome data
and selective reporting. Subgroup analyses of the primary analysis
of SBP were performed for contrasting sources of bias appearing
from the ’Risk of bias’ analysis.
Measures of treatment effect
Thiswasdefinedasthe meandifference (MD)betweenthe changes
from baseline to end of treatment during low- and high-sodium
diets. When units within an analysis were different the standard-
ised mean difference (SMD) was used.
Unit of analysis issues
Blood pressure (BP)
Combined analyses were performed including both parallel and
cross-over studies. The generic inverse variance data type was used
to analyse the effect in order to ensure that the weight of the cross-
over studies was not underestimated compared with the parallel
studies. For parallel studies, the SE was calculated in the usual way
as follows: SE (diff) = sqrt SE12 + SE22. For cross-over studies the
givenSE(difference)wasused. A linearregressionequation linking
the given SE to the calculated SE (sqrt SE12 + SE22) was calculated
bymeansof the studieswhich reportedboth SE(difference)andSE
on BP during both intervention periods. This equation was used to
transform all calculated SEs to estimated “true” SEs (difference) in
cross-over studies that did not report SE (difference). In this way, it
was ensured that cross-over studies were attributed proper weight
compared with the parallel studies. There were not enough studies
to calculate separate equations for Black and Asian populations
and therefore the equations calculated in the white populations
were used to transform these SEs when necessary.
Hormones and lipids
The very few parallel studies were excluded and the large fraction
of cross-over studies were analysed separately. As the large majority
of cross-over studies reported separate data for each intervention
period instead of overall estimates of effect, the continuous data
type was used in the separate analyses of the cross-over studies.
Dealing with missing data
If the SD was not reported it was calculated from a given SE,
95% confidence interval (CI), P value or t value, estimated from a
figure or imputed from the formula SD (change) = sq root (SD1sq
+ SD2sq), SD1 is SD on blood pressure before intervention and
SD2 is SD on blood pressure after intervention.
Assessment of heterogeneity
A Chi2 test included in the forest plot was used to assess whether
observed differences in results are compatible with chance alone.
A low P value (or a large Chi2 statistic relative to its degree of
freedom)providesevidence of heterogeneityof interventioneffects
(variation in effect estimates beyond chance).

Effects of low sodium diet versus high sodium diet on blood pressure, renin, aldosterone, catecholamines, cholesterol, and triglyceride
(Review)

 Assessment of reporting biases
Funnel plots were assessed for asymmetry. Selective reporting of
SBP and DBP was recorded
Data synthesis
Individual study subgroup data defined before randomisation
based on ethnicity and state of hypertension were included in the
meta-analysis as subgroups, whereas sodium sensitivity subgroups,
which were defined by the authors of the individual studies after
they had analysed the data, were combined by the present authors
and subsequently the combined data were included in the meta-
analyses.
The mean difference (MD) was calculated for outcome measures
with identical units in the included studies (BP without transfor-
mation of data (all measured as mmHg), adrenaline, aldosterone,
noradrenalin and lipids, after transformation). The standardised
mean difference (SMD) was calculated for outcome measures with
different units (renin), but a separate calculation of MD for the
majority of renin studies with identical unit (ng/mL/hour) was
also performed. With the MD method, the difference in effect be-
tween two treatments is divided by the SD of the measurements.
By that transformation, the effect measures become dimension-
less and the outcomes from trials, which have used different units,
can consequently be combined. As we accumulated data from a
series of studies that had been performed by researchers operating
independently, and as the goal of the analysis was to extrapolate
to other populations, we used a random-effects model in our pri-
mary analysis to estimate the summary measure as the mean of a
distribution of effects.
Level of significance:Incase of multiple independentcomparisons,
it is important to avoid coincidental significance. Ten meta-anal-
yses were performed. However, the SBP and DBP comparisons
are not independent of each other and BP depends on renin and
aldosterone as well as catecholamines. Concerning lipids, these
are mutually dependent, whereas the dependency on BP and hor-
mones is not obvious. Consequently, the 10 meta-analyses could
be sub-classified into a group of meta-analyses of mutually de-
pendent BP and hormones and an independent group of meta-
analyses of mutually dependent lipid fractions. Consequently, the
level of significance was reduced by means of the formula 1-0.95
x 1/N = 1-0.95 x 1/2 = 0.025, (N = number of independent in-
vestigations = 2).
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
Since the previous version of this review, we now have reason-
able evidence to determine the time of maximal efficacy to be one
week (Table 2). Therfore, there is a risk that studies lasting for
less than one week may underestimate the effect of sodium re-
duction. Furthermore, evidence has appeared to indicate that all
of the world’s populations have a mean sodium intake below 250
mmol/day (Table 1), and as dose-response studies have indicated
that sodium reductions from very high levels have bigger effects
than reductions from usual levels (Graudal 2015), such studies
may contribute to overestimate the effect. We therefore performed
a subgroup analysis intending to eliminate these potential biases
on SBP and DBP (stratified according to normal BP or hyperten-
sion) and renin, aldosterone, noradrenalin, adrenalin, cholesterol
triglyceride, HDL and LDL by exclusion of studies with a dura-
tion of less than seven days and sodium intake above 250 mmol/
day.
Sources of bias: subgroup analyses were performed for contrasting
sources of bias appearing from the ’Risk of bias’ analysis.
Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analyses were performed excluding studies giving rise
to asymmetry in the funnel plots.

Description of studies
Results of the search
During this 2016 update, we identified two studies with duplicate
data, which were subsequently excluded (Jula-Karanko 1992;Jula-
Mäki 1992), as all data could be extracted from a later paper (1110
Jula 1994).
In September 2014, a literature search for the present update was
performed as described in ”Search methods for identification of
studies“. The de-duplicated results from the searches revealed 626
articles. On the basis of titles, 549 were excluded. Seventy-seven
abstractswere readand27full-textarticlesobtained,of which,nine
fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In a supplementary search in April
15 2015, an additional 102 references were identified. Six articles
were obtained, of which three fulfilled the inclusion criteria.The
last updated search was performed on 7 March 2016. The de-
duplicated results from the searches revealed 994 articles. During
the primary screening, 687 were excluded and on the basis of titles
and abstracts, a further 236 articles were eliminated. Seventy-one
abstracts were read in detail and 29 full-text articles obtained,
of which, seven fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Additionally, two
articles were identified from a reference list of a review article. A
WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform search using
the search term “diet and sodium” revealed 141 trials, but none
were included.
A total of 185 references (164 from the 2011 review plus 9 + 3 +
9 new references) were thus included in the present updated 2016
version.

 Included studies
See Characteristics of included studies.
One hundred and eighty-five references were included in the re-
view. Eight included only data on hormones and lipids, whereas
177 included BP data, as well as hormone and lipid data in a sig-
nificant number of these. The total number of study populations
with BP outcomes included in the primary analysis was 206. The
median of the mean ages was 44 years (range: 12 to 73), which is
a little higher than the median age of most populations (typically
35 years) and the mean sodium intake in the high-sodium group
was 201 mmol/day (SD: 69) and in the low-sodium group was
66 mmol/day (SD: 47), corresponding to a mean sodium reduc-
tion of 135 mmol/day.The median of the mean ages of the study’s
125 white populations included in the subgroup analysis (dura-
tion of at least seven days, a sodium intake of less than 250 mmol/
day) was 45.4 years (range: 13 to 73) the mean sodium intake
in the high-sodium group was 177 mmol/day (SD: 35) and in
the low-sodium group was 68 mmol/day (SD: 36), corresponding
to a mean sodium reduction of 109 mmol/day. The mean BP in
the normotensive study populations was 119/71 mmHg, which
is close to the population mean of the USA population (119/71
mmHg) (Wright 2011), and a little higher than the mean of the
normotensive fraction of the USA population (115/70 mmHg)
(Wright 2011). The mean BP in the untreated hypertensive study
populations was 151/93 mmHg and in the treated hypertensive
study populations was 144/88 mmHg, both of which are higher
than corresponding pressures in the USA population (146/84
mmHg and 131/72 mmHg) (Wright 2011).
In 83 studies including 7729 participants, there was information
of the baseline 24-hour sodium excretion, not influenced by diets.
This was 159 mmol/24-hour (range: 90-274 mmol) (10-90 per-
centiles: 123-194 mmol).

Risk of bias in included studies
See Characteristics of included studies and Figure 1
Figure 1.
’Risk of bias’ graph: review authors’ judgements about each risk of bias item presented as
percentages across all included studies.
The obligatory trial quality criterion was randomisation. Double-
blind, single-blind or open studies with a parallel or a cross-over
design were accepted. A study was defined as single-blind if an
investigator measured BP without knowledge of the diet or by a
computerised manometer, and as open if precautions to decrease
observer bias were not mentioned.
We found two important contrasts: general blinding and blinding
of outcome detection (Figure 1). We performed subgroup analy-
ses of BP in both normotensive and hypertensive white popula-
tions, but not in the black and Asian populations due to the small
numbers of trials. We did not perform subgroup analyses on the
biochemical outcomes (hormones and lipids) as they are supposed
to be performed blindly in 100% of cases.

 Only 14 studies (1034 Watt 1985; 1078 Egan 1991; 1081 TOHP

Markota 2015; 1225 Gijsbers 2015), either partly or sufficiently
explained the allocation sequence generation and concealment.
Consequently, there is a general significant risk that allocation was
not unbiased.
Blinding
Fifty-six studies were reported to be double-blind and in 115 stud-
ies, the risk of detection bias was estimated to be low (Figure 1).
Separate analyses were performed on studies with low and high
risks of general blinding and outcome detection.
Incomplete outcome data
Based on the information given in the individual articles, incom-
plete outcome data generally was a small problem (Figure 1). How-
ever, only a few studies showed flow charts of the fate of the par-
ticipants. Therefore, this bias may be significant.
Selective reporting
Based on the information given in the individual articles, reporting
bias was small (Figure 1). However, as protocols did not exist for
the vast majority of studies, this evaluation may be imprecise.
Other potential sources of bias
The effect of an intervention on BP may depend on factors such
as baseline BP and ethnicity. Therefore, a biased distribution of
such factors in the included study populations compared with the
general population may bias the effect of the intervention found
in the meta-analysis to be different from the potential effect in
the general population. We therefore performed separate analyses
for hypertensive and normotensive individuals and for different
ethnicities.

 In subgroup meta-analyses of trials with a duration of at least
one week and a sodium intake of a maximal 250 mmol/day, the
MD showed a decrease in SBP of -1.31 mmHg (-1.83 to -0.80)
(P = 0.00001) (59 trials, 7125 participants) (Analysis 4.1) and
in DBP of -0.36 mmHg (95% CI: -0.79, 0.07) (P = 0.10) (61
trials) (Analysis 4.2). A further elimination of five studies, which,
although the mean BP was normal, did include individuals with
hypertension, reduced the SBP/DBP effect to -1.08/-0.24 mmHg.
In the trials of white people with elevated BP
, MD showed a de-
crease in SBP of -5.51 mmHg (95% CI: -6.45 to -4.57) (P <
0.00001) (84 trials, 5925 participants) (Analysis 1.3), and in DBP
of -2.88 mmHg (95% CI: -3.44 to -2.32) (P < 0.00001) (85 trials,
6001 participants) (Analysis 1.4) (high-quality evidence).
In subgroup meta-analyses of trials with a duration of at least
one week and a sodium intake of a maximal 250 mmol/day, MD
showed a decrease in SBP of -5.02 mmHg (-6.00 to -4.05) (P <
0.00001) (63 trials) ( Analysis 4.3) and in DBP of -2.78 mmHg

Renin
See Summary of findings 4
Two parallel trials were excluded (1110 Jula 1994; 1155 Heer
2000).
In the remaining 82 cross-over trials (5498 participants) of mea-
surement of renin (including 88 comparisons reported in the Data
& analyses), the standardised mean difference (SMD) of sodium
reduction was 1.22 standardized units (95% CI: 1.07 to 1.37) (Z=
15.68, P < 0.00001) (Analysis 5.1) (high-quality evidence). In 73
comparisons, which all had the same unit (ng/mL/hour), either
directly or after transformation, the MD was 1.60 ng/mL/hour
(95% CI: 1.40 to 1.79) (Z= 16.04, P < 0.00001).
In comparisons with a duration of at least seven days and a sodium
intake of less than 250 mmol/day (44 trials, 3470 participants),
the SMD was 1.05 standardized units (95% CI: 0.85 to 1.24),
(Z= 10.35, P < 0.00001) (Analysis 6.1) In 39 comparisons using
ng/mL/hour as the unit, the corresponding MD was 1.30 ng/
mL/hour (95% CI: 1.06 to 1.53), (Z= 10.65, P < 0.00001). The
effect in normotensive participants was significantly higher than
in hypertensive participants (Summary of findings 4).

Effects of low sodium diet versus high sodium diet on blood pressure, renin, aldosterone, catecholamines, cholesterol, and triglyceride
(Review)

Summary of main results
The effect of sodium reduction from an average high usual in-
take (201 mmol/day) to the recommended level (66 mmol/day)
was small in study populations with normal blood pressure (BP)
(-1.09/+0.03 mmHg) corresponding to a mean arterial pressure
effect of only -0.3 mmHg . In hypertensive study populations the
effect was (-5.51/-2.88 mmHg). In a subgroup analysis intending
to eliminate the potential bias of a very short intervention duration
(< seven days) and very high sodium intake (> 250 mmol/day),
the decrease in BP in study populations with a normal BP (-1.31/
-0.36 mmHg) and hypertension (-5.02/-2.78 mmHg) was also
small. The effect of sodium reduction on hormones and on lipids
showed statistically significant increases in renin, aldosterone, no-
radrenalin, cholesterol and triglyceride in the primary analysis, as
well as in the subgroup analysis, whereas the increase in adrenalin
was borderline significant (P < 0.03). The increase in cholesterol
in the low-salt group seemed mainly to be due to an increase in
low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which was borderline significant.
The slight decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in the low-
salt group was not significant.
The analysis of black populations showed that the effect of sodium
reduction in black people with normotension corresponded to the
one found in black people with hypertension. This was in con-
trast to the analyses of white and Asian populations in whom the
effect was smaller in those who were normotensive than in those
who were hypertensive. However, compared with previous anal-
yses (Graudal 1998; Jürgens 2003), the diverging results within
the black populations and between the black and white popula-
tions are smaller. In a recent detailed analysis, we found that a
significant fraction of the differences between the three ethnicity
groups could be ascribed to differences in baseline BP
, age, and
amount of sodium reduction. Furthermore there was no differ-
ence in BP outcome between ethnicity groups investigated in the
same study (Graudal 2015b) indicating that the differences found
in the present meta-analysis mainly may be due to confounders
rather than ethnical differences.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
In the primary analysis, population samples from the whole BP
distribution of the populations were included. In this analysis, the
intake of sodium in the “high” sodium group was in the interval
100 mmol/day to 795 mmol/day in 205 comparisons (99%), and
below 100 mmol/day in one comparison, the mean level being
201 mmol/day. The intake of sodium in the low-sodium group
was below 100 mmol/day in 168 comparisons (82%) and above
100 mmol/day in 38 comparisons, the mean level being 66 mmol/
day. In the subgroup analysis, the intake of sodium in the “high”
sodium group was in the interval 109 mmol/day to 248 mmol/
day in 143 comparisons (99%), and below 100 mmol/day in one
comparison, the mean level being 167 mmol/day. The intake of
sodium in the low-sodium group was below 100 mmol/day in
114 comparisons (80%) and above 100 mmol/day in 30 com-
parisons, the mean level being 60 mmol/day. Consequently, this
meta-analysis in general compares the effects of a dietary sodium
intake, which is lower than usual and in accordance with the rec-
ommendations to reduce sodium below 100 mmol/day with a
sodium intake, which is within the present world-wide usual range
of sodium intake, the level in the primary analysis being in the
high end of the usual intake and the level in the subgroup analysis
being close to the world mean of 159 mmol/day (Table 1). The
mean and the range of the baseline 24-hour sodium excretion of
the included populations before diet manipulation (159 mmol/
24 hours (10 to 90 percentile: 123 to 194)) were almost identical
with the usual range of sodium intake in the world’s populations
(McCarron 2013; Powles 2013). Thus, the present review shows
the consequences of the recommendations of the health institu-
tions, which is to reduce the usual sodium intake of the world’s
populations (90 mmol/day to 250 mmol/day) to a level below 87
mmol/day to 100 mmol/day.
Quality of the evidence
The study populations included in the present meta-analysis were
in general very heterogeneous with large variations in baseline BP
,
age, sodium intake and degree of sodium reduction. The analyses
of BP and hormones were generally very heterogeneous. Especially,
the I2 values for renin and aldosterone were very high, but as renin
and aldosterone rise sharply with sodium reduction below 2.3 g
sodium, but only moderately above 2.3 g sodium (Brunner 1972;
Graudal 1998), the extreme heterogeneity of the outcomes of these
variables is not surprising. In spite of the clinical heterogeneity, no
heterogeneity was detected in the meta-analyses of lipid outcomes
implying that these outcomes are robust. The number of studies
included in the BP analyses (n = 206) is substantial as is the num-
ber of participants (more than 6000). This should allow robust
conclusions. The fundamental quality criterion was randomisa-
tion, but a weakness is that very few of the studies described the se-
quence generation and the random allocation procedures leaving
a substantial bias risk of insufficient randomisation, which could
not be explored in a meaningful way due to the lack of contrasts
between the number of studies with low and high risk of these
biases (Figure 1). Another weakness was that a large number of
studies were not double-blind. However, concerning this source of
bias, there were no obvious trends towards different effects in the
low-risk blinded groups compared with the high-risk open groups
(Analysis 9.1; Analysis 9.2; Analysis 9.3; Analysis 9.4; Analysis
9.5; Analysis 9.6; Analysis 9.7; Analysis 9.8).

 The present review is the largest of the many existing meta-analyses
on sodium reduction, and other meta-analyses have not identified
studies, which were not identified by our search. Our analysis is
the largest partly because our selection criteria were less restrict.
Therefore, a fraction of the included studies had an experimental
character investigating a sodium intake far beyond the sodium in-
take in the general population for only four to six days, which may
not be relevant for the general population on long-term sodium
reduction. The fact that the subgroup analysis eliminating the po-
tential short-term intervention bias and very high sodium intake
bias showed similar results as the primary analysis indicates that
the inclusion of extreme studies had a minor impact on the mean
of the outcome effects. Other meta-analyses have extracted almost
identical data in the individual studies indicating that our data
extraction is unbiased. Finally, elimination of studies giving rise to
asymmetry in the funnel plots did not change the results indicat-
ing a low risk of publication bias.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
The scientific evidence behind the sodium reduction recommen-
dations is a series of studies and meta-analyses, which are biased by
high baseline blood pressure, high age and overweight (Graudal
(3) 2016). The most prominent of these studies (DASH 2001),
was additionally biased by a control group diet, which was de-
signed to contain only half of the normal amount of potassium.
Despite these studies are irrelevant as evidence for pubic health
recommendations, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
released draft proposed voluntary guideline to encourage compa-
nies to steadily reduce sodium in processed foods (Frieden TR
2016), the main argument being a dose-response meta-regression
analysis of mixed normotensive and hypertensive study popula-
tions, which was biased because it included mainly studies with
high blood pressure and inappropriately forced the dose-response
relationship through zero and thereby further doubled the pos-
tulated effect. In contrast, previous meta-analyses of randomised
controlled trials (RCTs) have shown similar results of sodium re-
duction on BP
. In 1986, Grobbee and Hofman combined 13 stud-
ies of persons with normal and elevated BP in a meta-analysis and
found a significant hypotensive effect of reduced sodium intake
on SBP of -3.6 mmHg and a non-significant effect on DBP of -
2.0 mmHg (Grobbee 1986). In 1991, a second meta-analysis of
24 RCTs showed an effect of -4.0/-2.5 mmHg for persons with
elevated BP and -1.0/-0.2 for persons with normal BP (Cutler
1991). This was verified in an update from 1997 (Cutler 1997).
In 1996, a meta-analysis of 53 RCTs showed an effect of -3.7/-0.9
mmHg in persons with elevated BP and -1.0/-0.1 in persons with
normal BP (Midgley 1996). In an analysis of eight RCTs lasting
for at least six months, the effect was -2.9/-2.1 mmHg for persons
with elevated BP and -1.3/- 0.8 mmHg for persons with normal
BP (Ebrahim 1998). These results were confirmed in an update
(Hooper 2002). All these similar results confirm that selection of
RCTs based on magnitude of sodium difference or duration of the
intervention does not significantly change the overall effect size
estimate. These meta-analyses indicate that major disagreements
about this effect size no longer seem to exist. However, there is still
significant disagreement regarding the relevance of the effect size
and the relevance of potential side effects (Taubes 1998).
The effect of sodium reduction on BP in hypertensive and nor-
motensive study populations in the present review matches the
effects found in most of these previous reviews, although the ef-
fect of sodium reduction on BP in normotensives is marginally
lower than in the meta-analysis, which supports the WHO rec-
ommendations (Aburto 2013). In hypertensive study populations,
there was no differences between the WHO review and our review.
In normotensive study populations, the difference was small, the
BP effect in the WHO review being -1.38/-0.58 mmHg and in
ours being -1.09/0.03 (-1.31/-0.36 in the subgroup analysis).This
study differed from ours as it only included studies lasting at least
four weeks. However, as duration has no impact on the BP effect
(Table 2), a more reliable explanation for the difference between
the WHO review and our review is that the study populations
with normal BP in the WHO review generally have a high baseline
BP in the upper 50% percentile of the population.
According to WHO, the small effect in normotensive study popu-
lations is sufficient to recommend sodium reduction for the whole
population, the assumption being that the association between BP
and mortality is consistent. This, however, may not be the case.
For instance, beta-blockers reduce BP in hypertensive individuals,
but not mortality (Wiysonge 2012), and a recent meta-analysis
of patients with diabetes showed that antihypertensive treatment
reduces the risk of mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in dia-
betes patients with SBP higher than 140 mm Hg, but if SBP is less
than140 mm Hg further treatment is associated with an increased
risk of cardiovascular death, with no observed benefit (Brunström
2016). Such studies indicate that it is not possible to extend the
general association of BP with mortality (Collins 1990) to the ef-
fect of a BP-reducing intervention on mortality. The reason for
this inconsistency may be side effects of the intervention. How-
ever, while short duration has been suggested to underestimate
the BP effect, it has concomitantly been suggested to overestimate
possible adverse effects on hormones and lipids. This idea that the
duration of the intervention tends to underestimate some phys-
iological outcomes and overestimate others has not been docu-
mented, but still has been used to disregard side effects shown in
studies lasting less than four weeks. Very few studies lasting more
than for weeks have investigated side effects, and further more
these studies do not reduce sodium to the recommended level,
but to levels above 87 mmol/day, and therefore the side effects
in these few studies may not be fully disclosed. In contrast, the
present analysis shows that the adverse effects on hormones and
lipids are significant, when the sodium intake is lowered from a
high usual sodium intake to a level in accordance with the recom-
24

 mendations of the health institutions. In addition, we have just
shown that sodium reduction results in an increase in heart rate of
2.4% (Graudal (2) 2016). This may be an important side effect as
resting heart rate is directly associated with mortality (Ho 2014;
Jensen 2012). The assumption that at least some of these effects
may be persistent and not just temporary has been indicated in
observational studies. Yanomamo Indians, who persistently ingest
very small amounts of sodium, have a three times higher level of
renin in the blood and a 10 times higher excretion of aldosterone
in the urine than normal controls (Oliver 1975). Furthermore,
renin and aldosterone rise slowly as long as the intake is above
100 mmol/day, but exponentially, when sodium intake is reduced
to levels below 100 mmol/day (Brunner 1972). Thus, the present
meta-analysis provides a possible explanation for the small effect
of reduced sodium intake on blood pressure: compensatory activa-
tion of the renin-aldosterone system is proportional to the degree
of sodium reduction. Furthermore, the increases in noradrenaline
and adrenaline may contribute to this counter-regulation (Warren
1980) and contribute to an increase in heart rate.
The very small effect of sodium reduction on BP in healthy in-
dividuals shown in the present review and other reviews includ-
ing the WHO review, the risk of significant side effects shown
in this review, and the possibility that an intervention to reduce
BP may not reduce mortality (Wiysonge 2012), and even may
increase mortality in some population groups with a normal BP
(Brunström 2016) indicate that the BP-effect is not sufficient as a
basis for recommendations in the general population, but should
be verified in studies directly relating sodium intake with morbid-
ity and mortality. Unfortunately, RCTs of the effect of sodium re-
duction below 100 mmol/day on mortality in healthy individuals
do not exist (Graudal (1) 2016). A recently updated meta-analysis
of eight RCTs with follow-up data on morbidity and mortality
found a non-significant trend versus reduced cardiovascular (CV)
morbidity, but could not demonstrate reduced all-cause mortal-
ity in the low-sodium group (Adler 2014). These trials were per-
formed in overweight pre-hypertensive or hypertensive individu-
als and the sodium reduction was not below 100 mmol/day, but
down to 100 mmol/day.
The sodium-mortality relationship has also been estimated by
means of 27 observational studies (Alderman 2010; Mente 2016;
O’Donnell 2014; Pfister 2014), which directly asses the relation-
ship between sodium intake in the individual and mortality. Most
of these studies were evaluated in an IOM report (IOM 2013).
This IOM report did not confirm the 100 mmol/day upper level
for sodium intake, which was defined in a previous IOM report
(IOM 2005), but concluded that “Science was insufficient and
inadequate to establish whether reducing sodium intake below
2300 mg/d (100 mmol) either decreases or increases CVD risk
in the general population”. A later meta-analysis of these popu-
lation studies found that a sodium intake below 114 mmol/day
was associated with increased mortality, as was a sodium intake
above 214 mmol/day (Graudal 2014). Increased mortality with
high sodium intake has also been shown in another meta-analysis,
which, however, did not investigate the effect of a low sodium
intake (Strazzulo 2009). This U-shaped relation between sodium
intake and mortality has been identified in several individual pop-
ulation studies (O’Donnell 2011; O’Donnell 2014; Pfister 2014;
Thomas 2011). The health institutions, however, generally do not
accept this evidence from the observational studies (Gunn 2013;
Whelton 2012; WHO 2012). In a recent paper, which discusses
methodological issues of observational studies, representatives of
the American Heart Association state that the association of low
sodium intake with increased mortality observed in observational
studies may reflect that sick people have a low sodium intake
(reverse causality: sick people with a high mortality have a low
sodium intake, it is not the low sodium intake, which increases
the mortality) (Cobb 2014). This hypothesis is not directly sup-
ported by the observational studies, as the outcomes generally are
adjusted for confounders such as cardiovascular and renal diseases
and diabetes and show that the mortality associated with a low
sodium intake is higher in healthy populations than in popula-
tions including sick individuals (Graudal 2014; O’Donnell 2014).
Table 3 shows a meta-analysis of the risk of all-cause mortality in
Study populations within the usual sodium intake range versus a
low sodium intake below 114 mmol/day (Graudal 2014) or be-
low 130 mmol/day (O’Donnell 2014). The analysis is confined to
include samples of individuals representative of the general pop-
ulations and all individual study analyses are adjusted for multi-
ple confounders such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension and
diabetes. To further reduce the risk of reverse causality, the most
healthy subgroup was included in the analysis, when results were
given for subgroups, The possibility of reverse causality can never
be completely excluded, but as a minimum there is no indication
in population studies that sodium intake below 100 mmol/day has
beneficial health effects in healthy individuals. In the NHANES
I and III studies this was demonstrated by independent groups
(Alderman 1998; Cohen 2008; He 1999; Yang 2011).
The BP effect of reduced sodium intake has been related to age.
Freedman and Petitti analysed data from Intersalt (Intersalt 1988)
and found the paradox that along with the significant association
between increase in blood pressure with age and the salt excretion
in urine, there was an inverse relationship between estimated BP
and salt excretion in urine at age 20. Freedman stated that unless
you preferred to conclude that salt should be eaten in high doses
by youngsters and in reduced amounts by the elderly, the findings
were probably due to uncontrolled confounding, not to variation
in salt intake (Freedman 2001). Furthermore, it is now clear that
the BP of different age cohorts in a cross-sectional study like Inter-
salt is not representative of each other, verified by a study showing
that recent birth cohorts attained lower BP than did earlier birth
cohorts in the period 1887 to 1994 (Goff 2001). According to
this study, based on data from more than 50,000 persons, it can be
estimated that the median BP is about 15 mmHg lower in a 50-
year old person from a recent birth cohort compared with a 50-
25

 year old from a birth cohort from the late 19th century. Conse-
quently, there has been a dramatic fall in BP during the 20th cen-
tury. In this context, the possible mean arterial pressure effect of
sodium reduction of -0.3 mmHg in normotensive persons seems
negligible. Finally, it has been difficult to maintain a significant
sodium reduction in longer-term studies, which should be taken
into consideration, when recommending sodium reduction. One
reason for this could be that the sodium intake is regulated by
neuro-physiological and hormonal mechanisms (Geerling 2008),
and therefore difficult to diverge from.
The hypothetical consequences of the present findings are that
people with normotension would have no benefit from sodium
reduction, but may suffer from harms, because sodium reduction
has a negligible effect on BP
, but results in significant side effects.
People with hypertension may benefit due to the effect on BP
, but
may also suffer from harms due to the side effects. This is exactly
what was found in the most recent meta-analysis of four popula-
tion studies (133,000 individuals) in which the authors had access
to individual participant data (Mente 2016). The conclusion was
”Compared with moderate sodium intake, high sodium intake
is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and
death in hypertensive populations (no association in normotensive
population), while the association of low sodium intake with in-
creased risk of cardiovascular events and death is observed in those
with or without hypertension. These data suggest that lowering
sodium intake is best targeted at populations with hypertension
who consume high sodium diets“, a conclusion, which matches
perfectly with the results of the present meta-analysis.

Implications for practice
The present meta-analysis shows that a low- versus high-sodium
diet in white people with normal blood pressure (BP) decreases
BP less than 1%. A significant concomitant increase in plasma
renin, plasma aldosterone, plasma noradrenalin, and to a lesser
degree of plasma adrenaline may contribute to the small effect of
sodium reduction on BP
. Furthermore, sodium reduction resulted
in a significant increase in plasma cholesterol and plasma triglyc-
eride, which expressed in percentage, was numerically larger than
the decrease in BP
. Due to the relatively small effects and due to
the antagonistic nature of the effects (decrease in BP
, increase in
hormones and lipids), these results do not support that sodium
reduction may have net beneficial effects in a population of white
people with normal BP
.
In white people with elevated BP
, sodium reduction decreases BP
by about 3.5%, indicating that sodium reduction may be used as
a supplementary treatment for hypertension. In Asian and black
people the effect of sodium reduction was a little larger than in
white people, but at present too few studies have been carried out
to conclude different from that above.
Implications for research
The data suggesting that black and Asian populations are more
sensitive to sodium reduction than white people requires further
studies. In future studies of mixed populations, it is important
that the effects on white, black and Asian populations are reported
separately. Population studies have shown a U-shaped association
between sodium intake and mortality indicating that the benefi-
cial effect of sodium reduction on BP outweigh the harmful effect
on hormones and lipids at sodium intake above the usual sodium
intake, but that the harms of sodium reduction outweigh the ben-
efits at sodium intake below the usual sodium intake. Long-term
randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with mortality and morbidity
outcomes would be desirable to confirm or reject these findings.
However, such studies may not be practicable. After 185 RCTs
and 27 population studies without an obvious signal in favour of
sodium reduction below 100 mmol/day, another position could
be to accept that the present usual sodium intake may be the op-
timal intake for the general population.

Only studies, which were representative for the general population and which adjusted for confounders were included.
If subgroup results were given, the results of the most healthy subgroup was used in the analysis to reduce
the possibility of reverse causation
#With primary NHANES analyses (Alderman 1998, Cohen 2008)
## With NHANES re-analyses (He 1999, Yang 2011)
* Studies were generally adjusted for at least sex, age and CVD risk factors
** In the male group a low salt intake group could not be identified, as the salt intake
in the lowest salt intake quartile was up to 159 mmol.

New citation required but conclusions have not changed
updated version of the review with up-to-date search and
methodology
4 January 2017
New search has been performed
1. Twenty-one new references were included. One
erroneously double-counted and two previously
included duplicate references were excluded.
2. Separate analyses of mean blood pressure (MBP)
in white participants were excluded. Instead MBP
effects were transformed to SBP and DBP effects by
means of regression analyses and included in the SBP
and DBP analyses.
3. Previous subgroup analyses of studies with a
duration of at least four weeks (BP), two to four weeks
(hormones and lipids) and lipid studies with sodium
reduction to moderate levels were eliminated.
4. Instead, a subgroup analysis of studies lasting at
least seven days and with a sodium intake of maximum
250 mmol/day in the high sodium group was
performed on all outcomes.
5. The text of the review includes new subheadings
available in Rev Man.

This review was invited on the basis of the first published version in JAMA in 1998 and therefore a formal protocol was not performed.
The purpose and the methods of the present update are essentially identical with the 1998 JAMA version and the previous Cochrane
