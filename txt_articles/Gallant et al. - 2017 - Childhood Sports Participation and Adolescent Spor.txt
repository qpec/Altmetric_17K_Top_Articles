OBJECTIVES: We aimed to increase understanding of the link between sport specialization 
during childhood and adolescent physical activity (PA). The objectives were as follows: (1) 
describe the natural course of sport participation over 5 years among children who are 
early sport samplers or early sport specializers and (2) determine if a sport participation 
profile in childhood predicts the sport profile in adolescence.
METHODS: Participants (n = 756, ages 10–11 years at study inception) reported their 
participation in organized and unorganized PA during in-class questionnaires administered 
every 4 months over 5 years. They were categorized as early sport samplers, early 
sport specializers, or nonparticipants in year 1 and as recreational sport participants, 
performance sport participants, or nonparticipants in years 2 to 5. The likelihood that 
a childhood sport profile would predict the adolescent profile was computed as relative 
risks. Polynomial logistic regression was used to identify predictors of an adolescent sport 
profile.
RESULTS: Compared with early sport specialization and nonparticipation, early sport 
sampling in childhood was associated with a higher likelihood of recreational participation 
(relative risk, 95% confidence interval: 1.55, 1.18–2.03) and a lower likelihood of 
nonparticipation (0.69, 0.51–0.93) in adolescence. Early sport specialization was 
associated with a higher likelihood of performance participation (1.65, 1.19–2.28) but not 
of nonparticipation (1.01, 0.70–1.47) in adolescence. Nonparticipation in childhood was 
associated with nearly doubling the likelihood of nonparticipation in adolescence (1.88, 
1.36–2.62).
CONCLUSIONS: Sport sampling should be promoted in childhood because it may be linked to 
higher PA levels during adolescence.

WHaT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: On the basis of 
theoretical models, sport specialization is associated 
with lower likelihood of sustaining physical activity 
over time compared with sport sampling. In addition, 
sport specialization is linked to poorer health outcomes 
compared with sport sampling.
WHaT THIS STUDy aDDS: Sport sampling in childhood 
is positively associated with recreational sport 
participation and negatively associated with not 
participating in sports during adolescence. Early 
sport specialization does not protect against 
future nonparticipation. Children who are sport 
nonparticipants typically remain nonparticipants 
during adolescence.

 Physical activity (PA) is essential 
for healthy development, 
1, 
 
2 but 
internationally, only 9% of boys 
and 2% of girls between the ages 
of 5 and 17 years meet current PA 
recommendations to accumulate 
60 minutes or more of moderate-
to-vigorous PA daily.3 Leisure 
time PA generally represents 
the most important component 
of volitional PA in children and 
youth4 and often involves sport 
participation.5 Approximately 
70% of young Canadians take 
part in organized sports, 
6 which 
have become increasingly 
competitive and demanding over 
the last several decades.7, 
 
8 This 
shift toward competition increased 
the ratio of time spent in organized 
physical activity (OPA) relative to 
unorganized physical activity (UPA), 
or free-play, 
7, 
9, 
 
10 which stems in 
part from the pressure to win and 
the desire to attain top status even 
at an early age.7, 
 
8, 
 
11 This may lead 
some children to become early sport 
specializers.
With both the Developmental Model 
of Sport Participation (DMSP)12, 
 
13  
and empirical evidence, it is 
suggested that compared with early 
sport specializing, participating in a 
variety of sports at a young age (ie, 
early sport sampling) is linked to 
greater motivation, less emotional 
stress, lower chances of burnout, 
14  
better motor skill development, 
10, 
15  
greater enjoyment of sports and 
PA, 
16, 
 
17 a greater likelihood of 
maintaining PA participation 
throughout the lifespan, 
13, 
 
18 and a 
lower risk of overuse injuries.19

21 
However, longitudinal studies are 
needed to address the limitations 
of these primarily cross-sectional 
studies, including the recall bias from 
retrospective recall in studies of 
elite athletes22 
–24 conducted in small 
samples.25 
– 
27
Adolescence represents the life 
period with the most marked  
decline in sport participation.28, 
 
29  
Because of this decline and the 
increasing competitive nature of 
modern day youth sport, clarification 
is needed on whether early sport 
specialization affects PA participation 
in adolescence. More specifically, 
with a comparison of the natural 
course of early sport specializers 
and samplers, we can provide 
evidence to inform interventions 
to increase PA targeting youth. The 
aims of this longitudinal study were 
as follows: (1) describe the natural 
course of sport participation over 5 
years among children who are early 
sport samplers and specializers 
and (2) determine if childhood 
sport profile predicts sport profile 
(ie, nonparticipation, recreational 
participation, or performance 
participation) in adolescence.
METHODS
Participants
Data were drawn from the 
Monitoring Activities of Teenagers to 
Comprehend their Habits (MATCH) 
study. MATCH is an ongoing 
longitudinal study of youth attending 
1 of 17 rural or urban schools in 
New Brunswick, Canada. A total of 
802 students (51% of those eligible) 
in grades 5 or 6 (ages 10–11 years) 
were recruited in year 1 (2011). 
Self-report data are collected by 
questionnaire every 4 months during 
the school year during class time. At 
the time of analysis, 5 years of data 
(15 cycles) were available. MATCH 
methods are reported in more 
detail elsewhere.30 Ethics approval 
was obtained from the Université 
de Sherbrooke ethics committee. 
All participants provided written 
informed assent and their parents 
provided written informed consent.
Measures
At each cycle, participants reported 
all free-time PA (ie, outside gym 
class) in the past 4 months using a  
checklist of 36 activities. This quest-
ionnaire is similar to other self-report 
questionnaires used at this age.31 
– 
33  
Participants indicated the frequency 
(ie, never, once a month or less, 
2–3 times per month, once a week, 
2–3 times per week, 3–4 times per 
week, or almost every day), with 
whom (ie, alone, with friends, with 
parents and/or siblings, or with 
an organized group or team), and 
where (ie, at school; at home or in a 
neighborhood; at an arena, gym, or 
pool; outside; or other) they most 
often participated in each activity. 
Each PA was categorized as OPA or 
UPA by using the method validated 
by MacKenzie et al34. Seven PAs 
(home exercises, trampoline, games, 
skipping rope, weight lifting, and 
indoor and outdoor chores) were 
categorized as UPA. The other 29 
PAs were also categorized as UPA 
if participants took part in the PA 
alone, with friends, or with parents 
and/or siblings. If they reported 
involvement with an organized group 
or team, the activity was categorized 
as OPA.34 For the analyses, indoor 
and outdoor chores were excluded, 
which can be viewed as nonleisure 
and/or nonvolitional.4 Walking 
was also excluded because it was 
reported by nearly all participants at 
every cycle.
After participants’ activities in  
each survey cycle were categorized  
as UPA or OPA, sport profiles for  
year 1 (childhood) and for years  
2 to 5 (adolescence) were created  
on the basis of the DMSP, in which  
it is suggested that children (ages  
6–11 years) can be characterized  
as early sport samplers (ie, high  
UPA level and low OPA level)  
or early sport specializers (ie, 
high OPA level, low UPA level, and 
participation in 1 sport only) (Fig 1).12  
At age 12, early sport samplers 
can become sport performance 
participants (ie, specializing 
in 1–2 sports), recreational 
participants (ie, high UPA level and 
participation in numerous sports), 
or sport nonparticipants. Early 
sport specializers either retain a 
performance-based participation or

 become nonparticipants. There are 
no standard methods for categorizing 
early sport specialization and 
performance profiles, but they can 
be distinguished from sampling and 
recreational participation by year-
round participation in only a few (ie, 
typically 1) sports.7, 
 
8, 
10
By using data from year 1 of 
MATCH (ie, cycles 1–3), participants 
with data in at least 2 cycles 
were categorized as early sport 
specializers, early sport samplers, 
or sport nonparticipants (Fig 2). 
Specifically, to represent year-round 
participation in 1 OPA and relatively 
low participation in UPA, early sport 
specializers were defined as those 
who reported participating in the 
same OPA at least once a week at 
every cycle in year 1 and participated 
in no more than 1 other OPA per 
cycle in year 1. The remaining 
participants were categorized 
as samplers if they reported the 
following: (1) participating in ˃1 
of the same OPA at least once per 
week at every cycle of year 1 or (2) 
participating in >1 OPA or UPA at 
least once per week at every cycle 
of year 1. Otherwise, they were 
categorized as sport nonparticipants 
(ie, <2 activities at least once per 
week per cycle in year 1). Coinciding 
with the DMSP point of transition 
at age 12, we used data from years 
2 to 5 to categorize participants 
into performance, recreational, or 
nonparticipant profiles in each year. 
The performance profile included 
participants who reported the same 
OPA at least once per week but no 
more than 1 other OPA per cycle in 
that year. The recreational profile 
included participants who reported 
the following: (1) participating in ˃1 
of the same OPA per cycle in that year 
or (2) participating in >1 OPA or UPA 
at least once per week per survey in 
that year. Nonparticipants reported 
<2 activities per cycle in that year. In 
a sensitivity analysis, we used a more 
stringent frequency criterion (ie, a 
minimum frequency of 2–3 times 
per week rather than once per week) 
with no substantial differences in the 
findings (not presented).
Face validity of the profiles was 
ascertained by 3 researchers with 
expertise in sport and PA research. 
In addition, because a subsample 
of MATCH participants take part in 
annual qualitative interviews, 10 
transcripts were randomly selected 
to verify whether the categorization 
scheme converged with the sport 
profiles of participants qualitatively. 
In all cases, the quantitative and 
qualitative categorizations coincided, 
providing evidence of concurrent 
validity.
Age, sex, income, and pubertal 
status were accounted for because 
researchers in previous studies 
suggested that differences in 
these characteristics may explain 
differences in the decline of PA 
during the transition between 
childhood and adolescence.28, 
 
35 
– 
37 
Participants reported their age and 
sex in each cycle. Neighborhood 
income was determined by matching 
participants’ self-reported 6-digit 
postal codes with the 2011 mean 
income of individuals (ages ≥15 
years) in their neighborhood, as 
per the National Household Survey 
census data. Income was grouped 
on the basis of tertiles. Puberty was 
measured by using the Pubertal 
Development Scale, which correlates 
strongly with physician assessments 
and self-rating scores (r = 0.868–
0.841) and has Cronbach’s α internal 
consistency coefficients of 0.67 to 
0.70.38
Data analysis
Proportions, means, and SDs were 
used to describe participants in each 
sport profile over the 5 years. The 
likelihood that participants in year 
1 retained a similar sport profile 
in years 2 to 5 was assessed with 
relative risk ratios. In these analyses, 
the reference group was participants 
not categorized in the given profile

 of interest in the given year. Changes 
within sport participation profile 
distributions were analyzed by using 
the Cochran-Armitage trend test. 
Trends in PA participation within 
and between groups were analyzed 
by using multiple regression. Odds 
ratios were computed by using 
polynomial logistic regression within 
a generalized linear mixed model 
framework (GLIMMIX procedure 
in SAS University Edition version 
3.5 [SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC]) to 
identify whether childhood sport 
profile, sex, age, pubertal status, or 
income predicted sport profiles in 
years 2 to 5 while accounting for 
clustering because of the repeated 
structure of the data. In these models, 
because it was the largest group, the 
recreational sport profile was the 
reference category. Interaction terms 
to assess whether the relationship 
between initial and future sport 
participation profile differed by sex 
or by pubertal status were tested but 
were not significant. Therefore, the 
analyses were not stratified by sex or 
pubertal status.
RESULTS
A total of 756 participants (55% 
girls) initially aged 10.7 (0.7 SD) 
years on average provided data in 
at least 2 data collection cycles in 
year 1 and were categorized by sport 
profile. In years 2, 3, 4, and 5, n = 
636, 608, 459, and 420 participants, 
respectively, were categorized by 
sport profile, representing 84%, 
80%, 61%, and 56% of the year 1 
sample, respectively. The median 
income of adults in the participants’ 
neighborhoods was 34 733 Canadian 
dollars. Compared with the analytic 
sample, those excluded lived in 
neighborhoods with a similar mean 
income (P for t test = .34) and 
were at similar stages of pubertal 
development (P for χ2 = .70), but they 
participated less frequently in OPA (P 
for t test: <.001) and in UPA (P for t 
test: <.001). Those who participated 
for <3 years were similar to those 
retained longer in regards to OPA  
(P for t test = .98) and UPA (P for  
t test = .21) participation, neigh-
borhood income (P for t test = .26), 
and pubertal development (P for  
χ2 = .94) in year 1.
In year 1, 147 (19%) participants 
were early sport specializers (54% 
girls), 506 (67%) were early sport 
samplers (56% girls), and 103 (14%) 
were sport nonparticipants (58% 
girls). Age and average neighborhood 
income were similar across profiles. 
Early sport specializers spent a 
greater proportion of their time 
in OPA than participants in other 
profiles (P < .001) (Table 1). In 
years 2 to 5, the relative proportion 
of time spent in OPA increased for 
performance sport participants (P < 
.001). Performance and recreational 
sport participants were involved in 
OPA approximately twice a week; 
sport nonparticipants reported less 
OPA (P < .001). Recreational sport 
participants engaged in more UPA 
than participants with other profiles. 
The number of UPA days decreased 
over time in all profiles (P < .001).
Relationship Between Childhood and 
adolescence Sport Profiles
Early sport samplers were >50% 
more likely to have a recreational 
sport profile over time than other 
participants (Table 2), and they 
were less likely to become sport 
nonparticipants. Early sport 
specializers were nearly twice as 
likely to have a performance-based 
profile in adolescence, but the 
likelihood decreased over time. In 
general, early sport specializers 
were 10% to 30% less likely to have 
a recreational profile in follow-up 
years than other participants. Being 
an early sport specializer in year 
1 was associated with a reduced 
likelihood of nonparticipation in

Categorization of sport participation profiles in a given year, MATCH 2011 to 2016. In the following 
example, we describe a female participant who was a sampler in year 1 and a performance participant 
in year 4. In year 1 (cycles 1–3), she reported involvement in ringette and gymnastics (OPA) and street 
hockey, biking, tennis, dance, and trampoline (UPA) in cycle 1. In cycle 2, she reported involvement 
in ringette and team handball (OPA) and aerobics, downhill skiing, trampoline, and games (UPA). In 
cycle 3, she reported involvement in ringette and team handball (OPA) and biking, football, soccer, 
volleyball, dance, trampoline, and games (UPA). Because she played ringette in each cycle and at 
least 1 other OPA per cycle in the year (ie, team handball in 2 cycles and gymnastics in 1 cycle), she 
was categorized as an early sport sampler in year 1. In year 4 (cycles 10–12), the same participant 
reported involvement in ringette and swimming (OPA) and jogging and home exercises (UPA) in 
cycle 10. In cycle 11, she reported involvement in ringette (OPA) and no UPA. In cycle 12, she reported 
involvement in ringette (OPA) and jogging (UPA). Because she was involved in ringette in all cycles 
and participated in <1 other OPA each cycle in year 4 (ie, swimming, cycle 10), she was categorized 
as a performance participant. a OPA and PA must be performed ≥1 time per week to be considered.

 years 2 and 3, but it did not protect 
against nonparticipation in years 4 
and 5. Early nonparticipants were 
more than twice as likely to remain 
nonparticipants over time compared 
with other participants.
Predictors of adolescent Sport 
Profile
Childhood sport profile was a 
statistically significant predictor of 
adolescent sport profile (Table 3).  
Samplers and specializers were 
less likely than nonparticipants to 
be classified as nonparticipants 
in adolescence. Compared with 
nonparticipants, specializers were 
more likely to have a performance 
than a recreational profile in 
adolescence. Being older was 
associated with nonparticipation 
and with being classified in the 
performance profile. Girls were more 
likely than boys to be classified in 
the performance profile. Compared 
with children living in higher-income 
neighborhoods, those in low- or 
middle-income neighborhoods were 
less likely to have a performance 
profile. Puberty status did not predict 
sport profile.
DISCUSSION
With the current study, we are 
the first to describe the natural 
course of sport participation from 
childhood into adolescence and to 
show that sport participation profiles 
in childhood predict adolescent 
profiles. Early sport specialization 
was associated with the per-
formance profile in adolescence, 
but it did not protect against future 
nonparticipation. Early sport 
samplers were less likely to later 
become nonparticipants. Given the 
importance of PA at all life stages, 
1, 
 
39, 
 
40  
these results raise concerns about the 
current trend whereby more children 
specialize early in sports.15, 
20  
In addition, we found that sport 
nonparticipants were at increased 
risk of remaining nonparticipants 
in adolescence. In accordance with 
previous findings, 
4, 
 
41, 
 
42 this highlights 
the importance of intervening early 
to promote an active lifestyle during 
childhood because it is a robust 
determinant of future PA level.
With this study, we are the first to 
provide longitudinal support for the 
DMSP tenet that early sport sampling 
increases the likelihood of long-term 
involvement in PA and that early 
sport specialization leads to a higher 
risk of dropping out of sports.16, 
 
18, 
 
26  
Similar to these findings, Russell 
and Limle43 found that compared 
with specializing, sampling before 
age 15 increased the likelihood of 
sport participation at age 20. Using 
a longitudinal cohort study design, 
Mäkelä et al44 found that greater 
diversity of sport activities at age 
17 predicted participation in PA in 
adults during their mid-30s. It is 
possible that sampling promotes 
long-term sport participation 
through the development of 
motivation, 
45 fundamental movement 
skills, 
45, 
 
46 or autonomy by engaging 
the individual in decision-making 
regarding involvement in sport.45
With the results of this study, we 
diverge somewhat from the DMSP, 
in which it is suggested that early 
sport sampling is associated with 
a higher likelihood of attaining an 
elite sport status.13, 
 
18 Early sport 
specializers were more likely to 
have a performance sport profile 
in midadolescence than early sport 
samplers. Early sport specialization 
necessitates many hours of deliberate 
practice to achieve the high level of 
performance sought with this type 
of sports participation. These high 
demands in physical effort and time 
may translate into improved fitness 
as well as time management skills.47 
It is possible that acquisition of 
these benefits help youth become 
performance oriented. Nevertheless, 
although early sport specialization 
can produce successful elite  
athletes, 
8, 
17 retrospective data 
support the DMSP in that many 
successful elite athletes began

49 The discrepancy 
between the current results and 
those of retrospective studies may 
relate to the follow-up ending in 
midadolescence herein, whereas 
the DMSP proposes elite status at an 
older age.13, 
 
18 Longer prospective 
follow-up is needed to assess 
the influence of childhood sport 
profile on late adolescent and adult 
profiles and whether early sport 
specializers maintain a performance-
based sports participation profile. 
Researchers conducting future 
studies should also assess whether 
performance in different sports is 
preceded by different childhood 
sport participation profiles. For 
example, past researchers suggested 
that sport sampling is a precursor to 
performance participation in most 
sports22, 
 
23, 
48 but that performance 
in sports such as gymnastics, figure 
skating, and diving may require early 
sport specialization.15
Participation in PA generally 
decreased over time in this study, 
corroborating data from multiple 
studies in which PA levels decreased 
during adolescence.28, 
 
29 Although 
OPA participation remained constant 
over time (contrary to findings in 
slightly older individuals), 
5, 
 
41 UPA 
participation generally decreased, 
regardless of sport profile. This 
aligns with results from longitudinal 
studies, wherein children decreased 
their time spent in UPA as they 
aged.50, 
 
51 Therefore, encouraging 
maintenance of OPA throughout 
adolescence may be important 
because sport participation at 
younger ages predicts later leisure 
time PA levels.44, 
 
52
Consistent with most literature, 
53, 
 
54  
the likelihood of sport nonparticipation 
increased with increasing age. 
Also, consistent with researchers 
suggesting that performance sport 
participation is not accessible to all 
given its cost, 
7, 
 
14, 
21 low household 
income was associated with a 
lower probability of performance 
sport participation in our study. 
However, household income 
was not associated with a lower 
probability of recreational sports. 
With these findings, we provide 
insight into previous contradictory 
findings on the relationship between 
socioeconomic status and general 
PA levels in adolescents.37, 
 
55, 
 
56 It 
is possible that only certain types 
of sport participation profiles are 
affected by socioeconomic status. 
Although puberty status has been 
linked to PA, 
35, 
36, 
 
57 it did not predict 
sport profile in this study. Girls were 
more likely to have a performance 
profile, which may relate to the age 
range covered in this study or to 
the fact that girls often participate 
in sports associated with early 
specialization (ie, gymnastics, 
diving, and figure skating).58 In a 
recent review article, researchers 
indicated that early-maturing boys 
are overrepresented on elite sports 
teams, whereas late-maturing 
girls are overrepresented on elite 
sports teams.59 Although we found 
no relationship between pubertal 
and sport participation profiles, 
researchers conducting future 
studies should investigate  
whether the timing of maturation 
is associated with specialization in 
specific sports.
If confirmed, the current study 
has 2 main implications. First, 
pediatricians, parents, and other 
people working with children 
should understand that if children 
do not participate in sports during

B. Organized youth sport as a 
childhood, they are at increased 
risk of being nonparticipants in 
adolescence. Strategies are needed 
to find ways to involve children 
in developmentally appropriate 
sporting activities. As suggested 
researchers in previous studies, 
such strategies could include after 
school programs60 and an increase 
in inclusive and noncompetitive 
intramural activities in school, 
61 
which are associated with long-
term PA participation.62 Second, 
although early sport specialization is 
associated with a higher likelihood of 
a performance profile in adolescence, 
sport sampling is preferable because 
it reduces the probability of dropping 
out of sport. Sports diversification 
during childhood should therefore 
be promoted by pediatricians, sport 
administrators, and parents.
The strengths of this study include 
the number of data collection cycles 
over 5 years. In this study, we are the 
first to describe the natural course of 
sport participation from childhood 
into adolescence, and we provide 
operational definitions of early sport 
specializers, early sport samplers, 
performance sport participants, 
recreational sport participants, and 
sport nonparticipants. In addition, 
in this analysis we focused on 
the crucial transition years from 
childhood to adolescence when 
behavioral patterns form and 
begin to consolidate. Although this 
important transition was captured, 
it is possible that earlier sports 
participation could have influenced 
sports participation before the 
initiation of follow-up. In addition, 
the length of follow-up did not 
permit an assessment of whether 
childhood sport profile is associated 
with sport participation in late 
adolescence or adulthood. Our 
definitions do not incorporate level 
of competition. Finally, because there 
are no objective measures of sport 
participation, this study is subject to 
overestimation typically associated 
with self-report PA measures.
CONCLUSIONS
Youth sports are becoming more 
competitive and demanding7, 
 
11 
such that many children specialize 
in a specific sport early on.63 By 
describing in this study the natural 
course of early sport participation, 
we demonstrate that, in contrast to 
children who participate in a variety 
of sports, the trend to specialize in a 
sport may increase the risk of sport 
nonparticipation in adolescence. 
With this study, we also highlight 
that children who do not participate 
in sports are unlikely to participate 
in adolescence. In line with current 
clinical recommendations8 and 
supported by our results, we 
suggest that to promote continued 
PA participation, it is necessary to 
encourage children to participate in 
a variety of sports early on. Beyond 
encouraging children to be physically 
active and until other evidence 
proves otherwise, pediatricians 
should advocate against early sport 
specialization and promote early 
sport sampling.
