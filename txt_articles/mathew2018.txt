Global Survey of Clinical Oncology 
Workforce
INTRODUCTION
Globally, cancer is the second leading cause of 
death.1 Although we know that cancer mortality 
rates are dropping in United States, even within 
the country, glaring cancer health disparities 
exist.2 In countries with less advanced health 
care facilities, cancer incidence and mortality 
continues to rise.1 In most of these regions, the 
mortality-to-incidence ratio is distressingly high, 
resulting in a profound burden on public health 
and the economy. Cancer accounts for > 200 
million disability-adjusted life years worldwide.3
A lack of access to resources to diagnose and 
treat cancer is a major hindrance to the equi-
table delivery of cancer care. In several regions 
of the world, access to cancer prevention and 
early diagnosis are suboptimal. The poor quality 
of cancer registries in low and middle-income 
countries results in a glaring knowledge defi-
cit that adversely impacts cancer health care 
delivery. Access to affordable cancer treatment 
using chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or radio-
therapy is another major impediment to global 
cancer control. In addition to these tremendous 
challenges, inadequate availability of health care 
professionals contributes to cancer health dispar-
ities. A shortage of > 2,300 medical oncologists 
in the United States is anticipated in 2025.4 It 
is an undeniable fact that there is a profound 
shortage of oncologists in several parts of the 
world; however, the magnitude of this problem is 
poorly described in the literature. The aim of this 
study was to survey and describe the availability 
of clinical oncologists around the world.
METHODS
Articles that provided data on the number of clini-
cal oncologists that were published after January 
1, 2007, and that provided data over any time 
period during the last 10 years were identified by 
using searches on PubMed and Google Scholar. 
In addition, searches were performed on profes-
sional society Web sites, documents, and gov-
ernment records that were obtained from the 
ministry of health Web sites of various countries. 
Data obtained from professional societies, gov-
ernment or health authority sources, research 
surveys, and expert opinions were considered to 
be valid for the purpose of this study. If there 
are multiple sources of data for a specific coun-
try, the most recent data were used if the source 
was deemed to be more reliable than the previ-
ous one. Because a nonsystematic search was 
conducted, a flow diagram will not be reported. 
A lack of well-trained clinical oncologists can result in significant cancer health disparities. The 
magnitude of this problem around the world is poorly described in the literature. A comprehensive 
global survey of the clinical oncology workforce was conducted. Data on the number of clinical 
oncologists in 93 countries were obtained from 30 references. The mortality-to-incidence ratio 
was estimated by using data on incidence and mortality rates from the GLOBOCAN 2012 database; 
the ratio was > 70% in 26 countries (28%), which included 21 countries in Africa (66%) and 
five countries in Asia (26%). Eight countries had no clinical oncologist available to provide care 
for patients with cancer. In 22 countries (24%), a clinical oncologist would provide care for 
 
< 150 patients with a new diagnosis of cancer. In 39 countries (42%), a clinical oncologist would 
provide care for > 500 patients with cancer. In 27 countries (29%), a clinical oncologist would 
provide care for > 1,000 incident cancers, of which 25 were in Africa, two were in Asia, and 
none were in Europe or the Americas. The economic and social development status of a country 
correlates closely with the burden of cancer and the shortage of human resources. Addressing the 
shortage of clinical oncologists in regions with a critical need will help these countries meet the 
sustainable development goals for noncommunicable diseases by 2030.

 Given the nature of the research question, such 
a search strategy is not expected to impact the 
validity of the study findings.
To obtain estimates on cancer incidence and 
mortality rates at the country level, the GLOBOCAN 
model—produced by International Agency for 
Research on Cancer—was used.5 It provides 
estimates on cancer incidence and mortality for 
2012. The ratio of newly diagnosed patients with 
cancer per clinical oncologist was ascertained for 
each country. For the purpose of this study, the 
mortality-to-incidence ratio was computed from 
the incidence and mortality estimates for 2012 
provided by the GLOBOCAN model. The eco-
nomic status of countries was classified into low-, 
lower middle-, upper middle-, and high-income 
groups on the basis of gross national income by 
per capita calculated by using the World Bank 
Atlas method.6 The social development of a 
country was defined by the Sociodemographic 
Index (SDI), which was derived from measures 
of education, income, and fertility, and classified 
into low, low-middle, middle, high-middle, and 
high SDI categories.3
RESULTS
Data on the number of clinical oncologists were 
obtained for 93 countries from 30 unique refer-
ences7-36 (Tables 1 and 2). It included 32 coun-
tries in Africa, 21 from Asia and Australia, 31 
from Europe, and nine from North and South 
America.
Economic Status and SDI
The economic status of 20 countries was cate-
gorized as low income, and 19 were categorized 
as low SDI. Two countries were categorized as 
low economic income but had low-middle SDI 
(Zimbabwe and Nepal). Two countries that were 
categorized as low SDI were deemed lower 
middle–income countries using the World Bank 
definition (Cote d’Ivoire and Mauritania).
Mortality-to-Incidence Ratio
The mortality-to-incidence ratio was > 70% in 
26 countries (28%) and < 50% in 23 (25%). 
In Africa, the mortality-to-incidence ratio was 
 
> 70% in 21 countries (66%) and < 50% in none. 
In Asia, the mortality-to-incidence ratio was 
 
> 70% in five countries (26%) and < 50% in 
three (16%). The mortality-to-incidence ratio 
was > 70% in none of the countries in Europe 
or the Americas. The mortality-to-incidence ratio 
was > 50% in 13 countries (42%) in Europe and 
seven countries (100%) in South America.
Ratio of New Diagnosed Patients With Cancer 
Per Clinical Oncologist
There were eight countries with no clinical oncol-
ogist available to provide care for patients with 
cancer (Fig 1). In 22 countries (24%), a clinical 
oncologist would provide care for < 150 patients 
with a new diagnosis of cancer. In 39 countries 
(42%), a clinical oncologist would provide care 
for > 500 patients with cancer, of which 26 
countries were in Africa (81%), nine were in Asia 
(47%), two were in Europe (6%), and two were 
in South America (29%). An extreme shortage of 
clinical oncologists—> 1,000 incident cancers 
per clinical oncologist—existed in 25 countries 
in Africa (78%) and two countries (11%) in Asia. 
None of the countries in Europe or North or 
South America faced such an extreme shortage 
of clinical oncologists.
DISCUSSION
This study identifies significant disparity in the 
availability of clinical oncologists among the 93 
countries surveyed. To my knowledge, this is the 
most comprehensive survey of the clinical oncol-
ogy workforce in the world. In addition to high-
lighting the critical burden of cancer in Africa, 
the study identifies an extreme shortage of clini-
cal oncologists on the continent as well. The sit-
uation was only slightly better in Asia. Compared 
with the burden of cancer in Africa and Asia, the 
situation in Europe and the Americas seems to 
be better; however, there are major disparities 
among the countries on these continents too. 
The majority of countries in South America had a 
mortality-to-incidence ratio of > 50%. Similarly, 
42% of countries in Europe had a mortality-to- 
incidence ratio of > 50%; however, compared 
with Africa and Asia, the availability of the clinical 
oncology workforce seems to be better in Europe 
and North and South America.
This global survey study has several limitations. 
Although the study is comprehensive and pro-
vides data for 93 countries, there are no data 
on the number of clinical oncologists for sev-
eral countries; however, previous studies on the

 oncology workforce shortage have focused 
on specific countries or regions and do not pro-
vide a global overview of the issue as the current 
study does.9,23,25,30,31 Data are collated from dif-
ferent types of sources. Some are from profes-
sional societies or government sources; however, 
some are based on the opinion of experts. Most 
expert opinions are from individuals who collec-
tively provide the estimates within the purview 
of a symposium or a survey, but some are indi-
vidual perspectives that are based on personal 
experience working in a country. Oncology is not 
a recognized subspecialty in several countries, 
and, therefore, accurate estimates are hard to 
obtain; however, the data on the number of clini-
cal oncologists are for individuals who exclusively 
care for patients with cancer. In some countries, 
such as India, it is possible that data on clini-
cal oncologists include radiotherapists, who are 
more qualified in administering radiation than in 
prescribing chemotherapy. The training program 
for clinical oncologists and radiotherapists are 
different in both duration and scope; therefore, 
it is possible that the data for such countries are 
an overestimate. Data on the number of oncol-
ogists are collated over a 10-year period. With 
the exception of three countries, data on number 
of clinical oncologists are collated over a 5-year 
period (2011 to 2015). Regardless, it is unlikely 
that the pattern of the oncology workforce short-
age will be any different if the time period was 
restricted to a single year. Finally, the estimates 
for annual cancer incidence and mortality that 
were obtained from GLOBOCAN 2012 could be 
imprecise as the data are obtained from cancer 
registries with variable quality. Nevertheless, the 
incidence and mortality data from GLOBOCAN 
2012 is recognized universally as the best esti-
mates on cancer burden currently available in a 
public domain.
There are several ways that we can improve the 
situation of the shortage of clinical oncologists. 
International organizations, such as the WHO 
and Union for International Cancer Control, and 
professional societies, such as ASCO and the 
European Society of Medical Oncology, can col-
laborate to conduct a global study on the avail-
ability of human resources for tackling cancer. 
Such a study should ideally involve a precise 
estimation of not just the clinical oncology work-
force, but also of radiotherapists and surgical 
oncologists. An accurate estimation of human 
resources and the strengthening of cancer

 registries will be an important step toward reach-
ing the sustainable development goal of reducing 
noncommunicable disease by one third by 2030. 
Training programs must be instituted in regions 
with an extreme shortage of clinical oncologists. 
Governments in countries with a shortage of clin-
ical oncologists will need to urgently design mea-
sures to address challenges within their regions. 
Nontraditional approaches, such as training and 
equipping primary care providers and nurses, 
can be considered in these countries. Countries 
such as Egypt and India that have a well-estab-
lished oncology workforce can be tapped to train 
the health care professionals in their region. 
Instead of utilizing scholarship programs to train 
doctors and nurses from low-income countries 
 
by sending them to high-income countries, 
the funds could be used to enhance regional 
 
collaborations. Similarly, oncology workforce devel-
opment can be significantly aided by collabo-
rations between institutions and universities in 
high- and low-income countries.
The economic status of a country and its social 
development status correlate closely with the 
mortality-to-incidence ratio and the availability 
of clinical oncologists. Of these three, improving 
the human resource capacity of a country would 
be a low-hanging fruit for the global oncology 
community. Increasing the availability of clini-
cal oncologists may not improve the quality of 
cancer care. Nevertheless, easier access to a 
trained health care professional will positively 
influence the society. Patients will likely be diag-
nosed at an earlier stage. Various precancerous 
conditions can be diagnosed and managed 
effectively. Curable cancers will be treated with
