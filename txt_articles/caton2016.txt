Background: The diagnostic work-up for heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) can take several days. Conse-
quently patients may be speculatively switched onto replacement anticoagulant therapy before a diagnosis is
confirmed. On-demand immunoassay diagnostic testing enables timely treatment decisions, based on test re-
sults.
Objective: To estimate the clinical and cost impact of the use of on-demand versus batched diagnostic tests for
HIT.
Methods: Literature was reviewed to identify test performance, clinical and cost data. Semi-structured interviews
(n = 4) and a survey (n = 90) provided insights into current practice and challenges. Flow diagram models were
developed to estimate the potential impact of on-demand testing.
Results: Modelling estimated more HIT-related outcomes for patients maintained on heparin whilst awaiting test
results and patients switched onto replacement anticoagulant therapy awaiting test results, compared with on-
demand testing and treatment based on the results. The budget impact model estimated that on-demand testing
reduced replacement anticoagulant therapy costs from $39,616 to $12,799 per patient. There are limitations to
the data available to inform modelling and the estimates should be treated with caution.
Conclusions: Using on-demand testing may drive positive effects on clinical and cost outcomes.

1. Introduction
Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a prothrombotic,
immune-mediated disorder caused by exposure to heparin [1]. Guid-
ance on the diagnosis and management of HIT [2–4], recommends
that patients whose platelet count drops by over 50% within 5–
14 days of heparin administration undergo clinical assessment using
the 4Ts score [5]. Those with a low score are unlikely to have HIT,
while those with high or intermediate score should undergo HIT immu-
noassay testing. Those with positive immunoassay tests should undergo
functional testing to confirm HIT diagnosis. Management of HIT involves
cessation of heparin and initiation of alternative parenteral anticoagu-
lants, such as a direct thrombin inhibitor or an indirect factor Xa inhib-
itor. The two major issues in HIT testing are test performance and test
turnaround time [6, 7].
1.1. Test performance
The polyspecific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA IgGAM)
is the most commonly used tests for diagnosing HIT. ELISAs have high
sensitivity, but poor specificity and positive predictive value. An
antibody-specific ELISA targeting IgG antibodies (most frequently impli-
cated in HIT) partly addresses these performance issues [8], however,
false positives remain a challenge [7]. Performance issues potentially
lead to increased expense as patients are treated unnecessarily using
replacement anticoagulant therapy and they may have poorer clinical
outcomes if the true cause of their symptoms is not addressed. The gold
standard diagnostic test for HIT is the functional serotonin release assay
(SRA), which demonstrates higher specificity than ELISAs.
1.2. Test turnaround time
Immunoassay tests take 2–3 h to run, but batching of multiple patient
samples into a single run is common, delaying the time-to-result to over
24 h. SRA testing is technically demanding, restricting its use to specialty
laboratories [8]. Outsourcing to specialty laboratories is common, with
turnaround times of over 24 h and a potential total turnaround time of
several days for the diagnostic work-up. The total turnaround time
may preclude following the pathway by increasing costs and worsen

 clinical outcomes for people with HIT, as they may develop more serious
complications if they are kept on heparin whilst awaiting laboratory con-
firmation of diagnosis. Therefore patients are often speculatively
switched from heparin onto expensive replacement anticoagulant ther-
apy based on the clinical assessment alone [2, 8], increasing drug costs.
The objective of this study was to review currently available assays
for the diagnosis of HIT, and investigate the potential clinical and cost
impact of on-demand testing. On-demand testing can be achieved
using either automated tests such as HemosIL® HIT-Ab(PF4-H) (Instru-
mentation Laboratory, Bedford, MA), rapid tests such as particle gel im-
munoassay (PaGIA) and lateral flow immunoassay, as well as ELISA
tests when performed on-demand. These options are not currently rou-
tinely used in most settings.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Literature searches
Literature searches were conducted in Medline, Embase, the
Cochrane Library and Scopus, to identify studies on the test perfor-
mance of HIT diagnostics, clinical outcomes and cost data related to
the diagnosis and management of HIT. Searches were carried out in
the US National Guidelines Clearinghouse to identify relevant guidelines
and in trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical
Trials Registry Platform Search Portal) to identify on-going trials of rel-
evance. A combination of relevant free text keywords and indexing
terms (where available) were used to retrieve relevant guidelines, sys-
tematic reviews, randomised controlled trials, diagnostic studies and
economic evaluations. The last searches were carried out on 25th Febru-
ary 2015 and limited to English language only.
2.2. Primary research
Primary research was conducted to understand real-world practice,
as compared with the guideline pathways [2–4] and to identify chal-
lenges faced. The first phase was semi-structured interviews with US-
based laboratory managers and haemostasis physicians (n = 4), ques-
tions were based on emergent themes from the literature review. Inter-
view findings informed a second phase survey (n = 90) in Germany,
the UK and US designed to validate the findings from phase one and fill
in data gaps identified in the available literature. Primary research partic-
ipants were recruited via a market research agency (Research Now) and
were reimbursed. Informed consent was obtained prior to commencing
the interview/survey. Interviews were carried out by telephone and re-
corded for transcription purposes. Surveys were completed online. Par-
ticipants were informed about the overall aims of the project, but not
that on-demand testing was the focus, to avoid biasing their responses.
2.3. Clinical and cost flow models
To estimate the potential clinical and cost impact of on-demand test-
ing, the flow of a hypothetical cohort of patients through the care path-
way was modelled using four scenarios. The first step for each cohort
was a 4Ts clinical assessment, indicating high or intermediate score:
• “Test and wait” (T&W) — 4Ts score high or intermediate, antibody test
is ordered (to be run in a batch), patient remains on heparin awaiting
the results of the batched antibody test.
• “4Ts and switch, continue” (T&SC) — 4Ts score high or intermediate,
antibody test is ordered, patient is placed onto replacement anticoag-
ulant based on the 4Ts score. Patients continue replacement therapy
regardless of antibody test result.
• “4Ts and switch, return” (T&SR) — 4Ts score high or intermediate,
antibody test is ordered, patient is placed onto replacement anticoag-
ulant based on the 4Ts score. Negative antibody test patients switched
back to heparin.
• “On-demand and switch” — 4Ts score high or intermediate, on-
demand antibody test is ordered, patient is placed onto replacement
anticoagulant based on on-demand assay result.
These scenarios built upon previous research [6] and were designed
to model the clinical and cost impact of different testing strategies, and
test the importance of timely and accurate results in HIT diagnosis. T&W
reflects following the guideline pathway and the impact of delayed test
results [2–4]. The two 4Ts and switch using batched IgGAM scenarios
represent speculatively switching based on clinical assessment alone,
because half of survey respondents indicated that they do so. The on-
demand scenario compared settings where test results are available
on-demand. The on-demand scenario does not apply to the majority
of settings, as the survey indicated that ELISA tests are often batched
and results are not available on-demand. Fig. 1 provides an overview
of the different scenarios.
Initially a different set of scenarios was used: T&W, a single “4Ts and
switch” and separate “on-demand and switch” scenarios for HemosIL,
IgG and IgGAM. However, the data from the survey indicated that a
large proportion of patients are not switched back to heparin, even
when test results indicate that they are HIT-negative. Therefore the de-
cision was taken to change the scenarios to reflect these findings, in
order to produce an analysis that was more representative of real prac-
tice. The most pronounced difference in the scenarios in terms of clinical
outcomes was between the batched and on-demand scenarios, rather
than between the different tests used on-demand. Given the limitations
to the data available, the small difference seen between the on-demand
tests (2 cases of new thrombosis) may not be reliable. Therefore results
were grouped for the different on-demand tests.
Within each scenario, four diagnostic groups were established – true
negatives, false positives, true positives, false negatives – based on the
performance of the 4Ts clinical assessment reported in the literature.
The prevalence of HIT varied across the included studies, making it dif-
ficult to compare their results, therefore a normalised frequency repre-
sentation for prevalence was calculated. Prevalence for normalisation
was based on median HIT prevalence (confirmed clinically or by SRA
testing) in the included studies, and the median sensitivity and specific-
ity of each class of diagnostic assay was used to calculate the false posi-
tive rate (1 — Specificity) and false negative rate (1 — Sensitivity). This
approach enabled the calculation of the impact of each scenario on the
hypothetical cohort by making the input data comparable. This ap-
proach is based on the methodology recommended by the Cochrane
Collaboration for comparing diagnostic accuracy studies [9]. The nor-
malised HIT prevalence was 20.4%.
Assay performance data for the flow models was derived from the
identified literature comparing the index test (4Ts clinical assessment,
HemosIL® HIT-Ab(PF4-H), ELISA IgG, ELISA IgGAM) to either clinical
HIT or the gold standard SRA (see Table 1).
The treatment strategies included in each scenario assumed the
following:
• True negatives continued to receive heparin.
• False positives were unnecessarily switched to a replacement antico-
agulant therapy (argatroban, bivalirudin, danaparoid, fondaparinux,
lepirudin) according to country-specific guidance.
• False negatives with isolated HIT continued to receive heparin, while
those with HIT with thrombosis (HITT) were switched to replacement
anticoagulant therapy.
• True positives in the T&S and on-demand scenarios were given re-
placement anticoagulant therapy. In T&W scenario, only HITT patients
were treated early, and HIT patients were treated late, after the results
of an ELISA IgGAM (the most common test) were obtained.
2.3.1. Clinical outcomes representing HIT complications
Clinical outcomes were defined as the aggregate of clinical outcomes
representing HIT complications: new thrombosis, bleeding events and
deaths. These were compared across the diagnostic groups for each
156

 scenario. The probability data for these clinical outcomes representing
HIT complications was derived from the literature (see Table 2). Clinical
outcomes representing HIT complications were calculated from the
identified literature to represent the impact of the delay in getting test
results. Based on the identified literature, different outcome probabili-
ties were assigned based on HIT status (no HIT, isolated HIT, HITT)
and treatment strategy (replacement anticoagulant therapy, continue
heparin). Where data was limited or not available, assumptions were
made based on the data available.
2.3.2. Cost outcomes
A retrospective cost-of-illness study identified two major costs of
HIT: hospitalisation and replacement anticoagulant therapy costs [10].
The current study investigated three countries: the UK, US and
Germany. There was a lack of reliable data on hospitalisation costs iden-
tified in the literature. Costs were also likely to be highly variable be-
tween and within countries. Therefore the primary cost outcome
chosen for this study was the cost of replacement anticoagulant therapy.
The minimum and maximum recommended duration of replace-
ment anticoagulant therapy was estimated based on the literature and
treatment guidelines [6, 11, 12] (respectively for the US, UK and
Germany 5, 7 and 7 minimum, and 9.2, 10 and 10 days maximum).
Drug unit prices were identified using zenRx [13], which aggregates
data from various sources, and the UK's Drugs and pharmaceutical elec-
tronic market information (eMit) [14]. The World Health Organization's
Defined Daily Dose (DDD) was used to calculate daily drug doses [15].

 Data from the survey about the proportion of patients prescribed each
replacement anticoagulant therapy was used to weight the costs of dif-
ferent drugs, giving an average daily cost for replacement anticoagulant
therapy. This daily cost was multiplied by the average treatment dura-
tion. Minimum and maximum drug costs for the diagnostic groups
were calculated for each scenario. Drug costs were calculated using
minimum and maximum ranges for drug unit price and days recom-
mended treatment.
There were no figures in the literature for other costs such as reagent
or labour costs (lab technician time required to run tests multiplied by
hourly wage). To address this data gap the survey asked respondents
who were aware of costs to provide an estimate of the total cost per
test. However, only a small proportion (26%, n = 23) stated that they
were aware of costs and there was a large variation in cost estimates
given (between $84 and $235 in the US). Therefore the data was judged
to not be sufficiently robust to incorporate into the model.
Data was extracted by one researcher and checked by other
researchers.
3. Results
3.1. Current HIT diagnosis landscape in selected countries
The survey found that immunoassay tests were ordered as part of
the pathway by over half of respondents. Functional tests were ordered
at the same time as immunoassay tests by about a third of respondents,
ordered after immunoassay test results by 38% and 30% did not order
functional tests. Over half of respondents stopped heparin based on
the 4Ts score without waiting for immunoassay test results. When a
negative diagnosis is confirmed there were geographical variations in
treatment, with 43% of US-based respondents switching patients back
to heparin, compared to over 70% in Germany and the UK.
3.2. Test performance
Six studies assessing the performance of available diagnostic
tests against clinical outcomes representing HIT complications were
identified [16–21]. These studies evaluated four classes of immunoas-
says (ELISA IgG/IgGAM, HemosIL® HIT-Ab(PF4-H), DiaMed ID-PaGIA
spin column and STiC Expert HIT lateral flow) and two functional assays
(HiT Alert and Platelet Microparticle Generation Assay — PMGA). Un-
published performance data for HemosIL® HIT-Ab(PF4-H) was supplied
by the manufacturer, who funded the analysis. Unpublished data was
not obtained from other manufacturers.
3.2.1. Immunoassay test performance
Using clinical HIT diagnosis as the reference standard, IgG ELISAs
ranged in sensitivity between 93.5% [16] and 100% [17], and in specific-
ity between 69.3% and 93.6% [16] (depending on the cut-off selected).
The IgGAM ELISA ranged in sensitivity from 97.7% [16] to 100% [16]
and in specificity between 84.9% [16] and approximately 90% [16, 18]
(sensitivity and specificity varied depending upon the cut-off selected).
In the manufacturer's data, HemosIL® HIT-Ab(PF4-H) demonstrated a
sensitivity of 94.3%, similar to that of the ELISA IgG when it was per-
formed using a higher cut-off than recommended by the manufacturer,
and a specificity of 92.9%, higher than the reported range for the ELISA
IgGAM and IgG tests. The DiaMed ID-PaGIA spin column assay reported
wide-ranging sensitivity between 75% [19] and 100% [17] and specificity
of 54.4% [17] to 100% [19]. The STiC Expert HIT lateral flow assay (testing
both plasma and serum) had a high sensitivity 97.5% [17] to 100% [17],
but lower specificity 82.2% [17] to 83.4% [17].
Using SRA as the reference standard, HemosIL® HIT-Ab(PF4-H)
demonstrated lower sensitivity than IgGAM ELISAs and PaGIA spin
column assay, and higher or comparable sensitivity to ELISA IgG and
the STiC Expert HIT lateral flow cytometry assay. HemosIL® HIT-
Ab(PF4-H) had higher specificity than the alternative immunoassays.
Overall, HemosIL® HIT-Ab(PF4-H) had comparable to lower sensi-
tivity compared to other available immunoassays, but higher specificity
(see Table 1).
3.2.2. Functional assay performance
When compared with HIT clinical diagnosis, two flow cytometry as-
says (HiT Alert and PMPGA) exhibited sensitivity between 88.2% [20]
and 100% [21], and specificity between 97.7% [21] and 100% [21],

 sensitivity and specificity both depended on the cut-off value used. One
study evaluated SRA against clinical HIT as the reference standard, with
a resultant sensitivity of 88.9% [21] and specificity of 95.5% [21].
Across the identified studies, HemosIL® HIT-Ab(PF4-H) had lower
specificity, but higher sensitivity than the functional flow cytometry
(with clinical HIT diagnosis or SRA as reference standard) and SRA
tests (see Table 1).
3.3. Clinical impact
The clinical impact flow model measured the performance of
batched and on-demand immunoassay testing. The flow diagram
modelled the movement of 1000 hypothetical patients through the
care pathways using the four scenarios and by diagnostic group, evalu-
ating the impact on major clinical outcomes (see Fig. 2).
There was limited clinical outcome data available in published
studies for individual groups, therefore a number of assumptions had
to be made to obtain figures for use in the model. For example, data
on HIT outcome rates for true negatives and false positives was inconsis-
tent, and an assumption was made that these figures ought to be the
same.
The number of clinical outcomes representing HIT complications
was higher for the T&W scenario, compared with all other scenarios
(batched and on-demand). There was no difference in clinical outcomes
representing HIT complications between the two “4Ts and switch” sce-
narios, regardless of whether patients returned to heparin. Clinical
outcomes representing HIT complications were lower in the on-
demand scenarios than all others. See Fig. 3 for detailed numbers.
3.4. Cost impact
The cost impact flow model was designed to assess the potential cost
impact of on-demand testing facilitating treatment decisions based on
test results.
The estimated average total cost of HIT varies across countries rang-
ing from €2090 to €3200 [10] in Germany, and €3330 to €3700 [12] in
other European countries to approximately $35,400 [22] to $64,800
[23] in the US. A retrospective cost of illness study identified two key
drivers of the additional average cost of HIT in a German hospital:
lengthened hospital stay, which accounted for 70.3% (€6330) of the ad-
ditional costs, and medication costs, which accounted for 19.7% (€1777)
of total additional costs [10].
The speculative treatment approach of both “4Ts and switch” sce-
narios resulted in high replacement anticoagulant therapy costs of a
maximum of $39,616, $11,839, $6833 respectively per patient in the
US, UK and Germany for the scenario where patients remain on replace-
ment anticoagulation therapy. Costs are lower when some of the 4Ts
false positive patients are switched back to heparin when their test
“4Ts and Switch, Return”. “On-demand and Switch” resulted in reduced
replacement anticoagulant therapy costs from a maximum of $14,017
with “T&S” to $12,799 in the US, from $4007 to $3811 in the UK, from
$2333 to $2201 in Germany per patient. The data in the “Test and

 Wait” scenario is based on IgGAM test performance results. See Fig. 4
and Table 3 for the total cost of replacement anticoagulant therapy for
each of the four scenarios (in thousands of dollars) per 1000 patients.
4. Discussion
The two main issues in HIT diagnostic testing are test performance
and test turnaround time, with the survey indicating that only 6% of re-
spondents were satisfied with current test performance, with ELISA test
specificity in particular viewed as suboptimal. There was also dissatis-
faction with turnaround times of over 24 h. Delays in diagnosis caused
by test turnaround time can lead to speculative treatment, increasing
drug costs as people without HIT are speculatively switched to replace-
ment anticoagulant therapy. Such delays may increase costs if replace-
ment anticoagulant therapy is used unnecessarily, conversely if people
with HIT are kept on heparin whilst awaiting laboratory confirmation
of diagnosis they may develop more serious complications. In addition
to the increased expense of unnecessary replacement anticoagulant
therapy for false positive patients, delays in test results could potentially
lead to poorer clinical outcomes as the true cause of the symptoms caus-
ing HIT suspicion is not addressed.
The literature review showed that HemosIL® HIT-Ab(PF4-H) has a
higher specificity, and comparable or lower sensitivity than currently
available tests (ELISAs, spin column assays and lateral flow assays). Its
higher specificity means that HemosIL® HIT-Ab(PF4-H) has a lower
false positive rate than other immunoassay tests.
The clinical impact flow diagram using a hypothetical cohort of 1000
patients found that different tests performed on-demand performed
comparably (figures not shown, available on request). The only differ-
ence was two fewer cases of new thrombosis with on-demand IgG
than with other on-demand tests (17 versus 19) and therefore two
fewer overall cases of clinical outcomes representing HIT complications.
The difference in clinical and cost impact was most pronounced be-
tween batched and on-demand testing scenarios. There was a lack of
good quality data on clinical outcomes representing HIT complications
for false positives and no distinction between treated groups and non-
treated false positives. Therefore it was not possible to calculate the clin-
ical value for false positives of avoiding either overtreatment or lack of
treatment for any underlying cause of HIT suspicion. The T&W scenario
entailed delayed test results and subsequently a delayed treatment ap-
proach, which resulted in higher HIT outcome events than all of the
other scenarios. This finding points the importance of timely test results
in HIT diagnosis and treatment.
Estimates of the costs of HIT varied, with notably higher costs in the
US. Costs were mainly driven by hospitalisation and drug costs [10]. A
retrospective cost of illness study found no significant difference in
overall costs between early vs. delayed replacement anticoagulant ther-
apy; despite high medication costs in the former group, suggesting that
early initiation of replacement anticoagulant therapy may avoid costly
complications [10]. Tests with a quicker turnaround would enable earli-
er treatment of patients who are positive for HIT and therefore poten-
tially reduce costs to healthcare systems. Additional benefit of using
on-demand testing can be expected from reduced length of stay, further
to a lower rate of adverse events in HIT patients. Given the highly vari-
able hospitalisation costs and lack of reliable data, this cost has not been
measured in this work, rather, could be assessed on an ad-hoc basis de-
pending on the local costs. Similarly the cost of the test reagents and la-
bour to perform them has not been assessed in this work, due to a lack
of robust data.
4.1. Limitations
The assessment of the number of clinical outcomes representing HIT
complications relied on the availability of data from the studies included
in the literature review. For example it was not possible to quantify the
difference in bleeding because there is no data reporting the impact of
early vs. late treatment on bleeding. For clinical outcomes representing
HIT complications, we therefore used the incidence rates of thrombosis
and death, which have been reported. The data on adverse outcomes for
false positives and true negative (i.e. those without HIT) is based on
small samples, and there is no data from robust samples for each
group and subgroup (e.g. stratified by 4Ts score). We therefore used
the most robust data available and made the assumption that the inci-
dence was similar across “non-HIT” groups. As some of this data is
based on small sample sizes and assumptions, the data should be
viewed with caution.
Test performance data for HemosIL® HIT-Ab(PF4-H) was provided
by the manufacturer. Unpublished data for other tests was not sought
from other manufacturers, and this may affect results.
The overall validity of these results is limited by differences in the se-
lected study populations and in the gold standard definitions of HIT
used, which may affect the comparability of the study populations.
The lack of reported data on the characteristics of those suspected of

 having HIT, such as the 4Ts score cut-off used, means that it is not clear
whether these cohorts can be directly compared because they may rep-
resent different pre-test probabilities. The definition of ‘clinical HIT’ was
also either not reported or poorly described in studies, therefore there
may be variations in the definitions of the gold standard ‘clinical HIT’
diagnosis.
The sample sizes for our primary research were not large enough to
make definitive statements based on the findings. Hence data was not
incorporated where it was judged to not be sufficiently robust (such
as the cost estimates for reagents and labour costs). There is a potential
for bias where respondents try to give the answer that they think the
surveyor wants. To minimise this bias we included cross-checking ques-
tions, designed to test respondents' previous answers and rotated op-
tions in multi-choice questions. The primary research was not
designed to be comprehensive, but to give additional insight into real-
world practice and to help to fill gaps identified in the literature if
possible.
Analyses were adapted during the study to explore areas of differ-
ence between scenarios and make them more representative of real
practice. Similar sensitivity and specificity of the tests meant that anal-
yses which did not incorporate length of treatment with replacement
anticoagulant therapy did not capture potential differences between
the scenarios. Therefore duration of use of the different replacement an-
ticoagulant therapy was incorporated in the model. The three on-
demand scenarios were combined after analyses showed that the
most pronounced difference in clinical outcomes was between the
batched and on-demand scenarios. The limitations to the data available
and the small difference seen between the on-demand tests (2 cases of
new thrombosis) meant that these differences may not have been reli-
able. Similarly the “4Ts and switch” scenarios were split into those
returning to heparin and those continuing on replacement anticoagu-
lant therapy after data from the survey indicated that in reality a large
proportion of patients are not switched back to heparin, even when
test results indicate that they are HIT-negative.
5. Conclusion
On-demand HIT testing has the potential to have a positive clinical
and economic impact. Rapid testing enables earlier informed treatment
based on high performance tests, rather than speculative treatment or
delayed decision making. This could potentially improve clinical out-
comes in HIT patients by enabling earlier appropriate treatment and re-
duce costs by preventing expensive complications. In patients
speculatively treated who turn out to be HIT negative, on-demand test-
ing could reduce replacement anticoagulant therapy drug costs.
Further research is needed to enable more definitive conclusions to
be reached about the overall clinical and economic value of on-
demand testing. In particular there is a need for comparable data
about clinical outcomes representing HIT complications for individual
groups and subgroups (e.g. stratified by 4Ts score). There is also a
need for improved reporting of patient characteristics and definitions
of ‘clinical HIT’. Furthermore, economic evaluations that take into ac-
count costs of testing itself, and any system-wide cost savings, such as
reduced length of stay due to earlier treatment, would be useful in un-
derstanding the overall cost impact of on-demand testing.
