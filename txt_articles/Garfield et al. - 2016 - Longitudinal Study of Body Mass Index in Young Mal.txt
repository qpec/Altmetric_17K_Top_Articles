Obesity
Introduction
As obesity continues to be a major public health priority 
for American families, investigating the contribution of 
the social determinants to changes in body mass index 
(BMI) is essential for prevention. With an estimated 70.1 
million U.S. fathers (U.S. Department of Commerce, 
2014), fatherhood is a key social determinant of men’s 
overall health (Durette, Marrs, & Gray, 2011). However, 
the relationship between BMI and fatherhood remains to 
be explored. Males report higher BMI compared with 
females (Ogden, Carroll, Kit, & Flegal, 2012) with fathers 
being more likely than mothers to be classified as over-
weight or obese (Magarey, Daniels, Boulton, & 
Cockington, 2003), and for their weight to be a better pre-
dictor of later child overweight and obesity than the 
mother’s (Brophy, Rees, Knox, Baker, & Thomas, 2012; 
Freeman et al., 2012). Men’s weight in adolescence and 
young adulthood, when they may be transitioning to 
fatherhood, is an important risk factor for diabetes (de 
Mutsert, Sun, Willett, Hu, & van Dam, 2014; Twig et al., 
2014), accelerated coronary atherosclerosis (Flegal, Kit, 
Orpana, & Graubard, 2013; Jeffreys, McCarron, Gunnell, 
McEwen, & Smith, 2003; McGill et al., 2002; Schmidt, 
Bøtker, Pedersen, & Sørensen, 2014), future cardiovascu-
lar disease (Baker, Olsen, & Sorensen, 2007; Jeffreys 
et al., 2003; McGill et al., 2002), cancer (Han et al., 
2014), and premature death (Schmidt et al., 2013; Yarnell, 
Patterson, Thomas, & Sweetnam, 2000).

Abstract
Despite a growing understanding that the social determinants of health have an impact on body mass index (BMI), 
the role of fatherhood on young men’s BMI is understudied. This longitudinal study examines BMI in young men over 
time as they transition from adolescence into fatherhood in a nationally representative sample. Data from all four 
waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health supported a 20-year longitudinal analysis of 10,253 
 
men beginning in 1994. A “fatherhood-year” data set was created and changes in BMI were examined based on 
fatherhood status (nonfather, nonresident father, resident father), fatherhood years, and covariates. Though age is 
positively associated with BMI over all years for all men, comparing nonresident and resident fathers with nonfathers 
reveals different trajectories based on fatherhood status. Entrance into fatherhood is associated with an increase in 
BMI trajectory for both nonresident and resident fathers, while nonfathers exhibit a decrease over the same period. In 
this longitudinal, population-based study, fatherhood and residence status play a role in men’s BMI. Designing obesity 
prevention interventions for young men that begin in adolescence and carry through young adulthood should target 
the distinctive needs of these populations, potentially improving their health outcomes.

The transition to fatherhood is a time of change for 
men. Evidence is accumulating that suggests this transi-
tion may affect the health behaviors of men which in turn 
may affect BMI, especially among at-risk populations. 
First, many men state becoming a father motivated them 
to change and improve their health behaviors such as eat-
ing a more nutritious diet, exercising more often, and 
drinking less alcohol (Garfield, Clark-Kauffman, & 
Davis, 2006). Yet little empiric work exists examining the 
role of becoming a father on BMI and whether the transi-
tion to fatherhood alone might affect the changes in BMI. 
Second, as our understanding of fatherhood and its differ-
ent types expands, such as resident fathers who live with 
their children or nonresident fathers who live away from 
their children, an appreciation of the interactions between 
health risks and father type is beginning to emerge. For 
example, resident fathers are typically older, more edu-
cated, and employed with higher incomes compared with 
nonresident fathers (Castillo, Welch, & Sarver, 2011; 
Sorensen & Zibman, 2001). These characteristics have all 
been reported to be protective against increased BMI. In 
addition, being married, which many resident fathers are, 
also offers health benefits for men and may be protective 
of weight changes (Waite, 1995). Third, race/ethnicity and 
socioeconomic status have been implicated in terms of 
who becomes a father and when as well as in BMI changes 
(Berry et al., 2010; Hanson & Chen, 2007; Sobal & 
Stunkard, 1989; Wang, 2001). A systematic review of obe-
sity rates reported that ethnic minorities and low- 
socioeconomic groups were disproportionally affected at 
all ages (Flegal, Carroll, Kit, & Ogden, 2012; U.S. 
Department of Health & Human Services, 2010; Wang & 
Zhang, 2006). Finally, lower education, which is associated 
with earlier and nonresident fatherhood, predicts obesity 
presumably because higher education enhances general 
nutrition knowledge, improved access to nutritional food, 
and increased access to information and tools for weight 
control (Galobardes, Morabia, & Bernstein, 2000; Jeffery, 
1996). To our knowledge, no prior studies have accounted 
collectively for these factors when examining BMI trajecto-
ries over the life course and during the key developmental 
milestone of the transition to fatherhood.
This exploratory study examines associations between 
fatherhood and BMI. Specifically, the primary goal of 
this study is to assess whether the transition to fatherhood 
was associated with changes in BMI among men over 
time, whether this association varied by fathers’ residence 
status, and whether it differed when controlling for key 
social and demographic factors. Studies of the life course 
trajectory of paternal BMI have been hampered by a lack 
of data sets that are longitudinal, community-based, tem-
porally correct, and represent a large enough population 
to have stable estimates. To address these limitations, 
data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent 
Health (Add Health), which followed a representative 
sample of 20,745 American youth (10,253 males) from 
adolescence through early adulthood, were assessed. Add 
Health provides an exceptional opportunity to investigate 
the determinants of BMI over time, enabling compari-
sons of pre-fatherhood and post-fatherhood BMI while 
controlling for covariates, and to determine their rele-
vance to population health and prevention. Understanding 
the progression of paternal BMI to delineate key points of 
intervention for prevention and treatment may benefit 
both fathers and their offspring.
Method
Study Sample
Add Health (Chen & Chantala, 2014) is a longitudinal 
study of a nationally representative sample of youth 
focusing on social, behavioral, and biomedical health as 
they progress from adolescence into adulthood. Wave I 
 
(n = 10,263 males; ages = 12-21 years) was conducted in 
1994 to 1995; Wave II (n = 7,192, ages = 13-21 years) in 
1996; Wave III (n = 7,192, ages = 18-28 years), 6 years 
later in 2001 to 2002, and Wave IV (n = 7,347, ages = 
25-34 years), 6 years after that in 2007 to 2008. The insti-
tutional review board approved this study.
BMI
Height and weight measurement were collected in all 
four waves of the study. Height and weight data were 
self-reported in Wave I and measured by the interviewer 
in all subsequent waves. BMI was calculated from these 
height and weight values for all four waves. Clarke et al. 
(2014) demonstrated that men’s self-reported BMI and 
measured BMI were consistent from adolescence through 
adulthood. Add Health intentionally oversampled adoles-
cents from various economic and racial/ethnic subgroups 
(Chen & Chantala, 2014); therefore, study-supplied 
weights, which also account for nonresponse and attrition 
and allowed for the sample to be representative of the 
adolescent population at baseline, were included.
Fatherhood Status
Fatherhood status was coded into three categories: resi-
dent fathers, nonresident fathers, and nonfathers. Each 
participant’s fatherhood status was defined using the 
household roster (reports of each member of their house-
hold) and live child data set (reports of each child they 
have fathered) from each wave; fathers were those who 
had listed a biological child. Residence status was defined 
by whether a child was listed in the household roster at 
entrance into fatherhood while controlling for interview 
 N160

year. Validity checks confirmed that the index child was 
indeed the first biological child for that respondent. 
Father classification was held constant through all future 
waves; nonfathers were the referent group for analyses.
Covariates
Covariates included respondents’ age, education, physi-
cal health, income, and number of children (all assessed 
at each wave) as well as race/ethnicity, own mother’s 
education (Wave I assessment). Race/ethnicity was cate-
gorized as White (referent), Black, Asian, Hispanic, and 
Other. Marital status was measured at entrance into 
fatherhood. Parents’ household income was used for each 
wave in which the respondent was still an adolescent. 
Health behaviors that may affect BMI were assessed at 
Waves I to IV and included screen hours (hours of televi-
sion and computer summed/week) and daily physical 
activities (sum of times/week).
Statistical Analysis
Creating a Fatherhood-Years Data Set. A person-year file 
comprising data collected from adolescence through adult-
hood for young men was created using separate data records 
for each male encompassing study identification number, 
demographic, covariate, and BMI data to analyze BMI 
preentrance and postentrance into fatherhood. These “per-
son-year” records used fatherhood status in each of the pos-
sible years of the data collection period and calculated time 
in fatherhood (i.e., “fatherhood years”) on the basis of 
wave-specific information regarding the age of the firstborn 
child. For example, a participant who first mentioned a 
4-year old in Wave IV was coded as having +4 fatherhood 
years in Wave IV and −2 fatherhood years in Wave III 
(which was conducted 6 years prior to Wave IV), −8 father-
hood years in Wave II (conducted 12 years prior), and −9 
fatherhood years in Wave I (conducted 13 years prior). 
Data from males who were never observed to be fathers 
were centered on the (weighted/winsorized) mean age of 
entrance into fatherhood for all fathers in the sample, age 
23. Thus, “fatherhood years” for a nonfather observed at 
age 26 was coded as +3. Once complete, all participants had 
four rows of data corresponding to four waves of data col-
lection. This allows for comparisons of fatherhood years 
over the 19-year range between nonfathers and fathers and 
resembles other approaches to defining person-years sur-
rounding events of interest (Duncan, Wilkerson, & Eng-
land, 2006; Garfield et al., 2014; Huang & Warner, 2005). 
For simplicity and comparisons, the term “fatherhood 
years” is used for fathers and nonfathers.
Multiple Imputations. Multiple imputations have been rec-
ommended from numerous sources to minimize the bias 
of data missing at random (Harel & Zhou, 2007; Rubin, 
1987; White, Royston, & Wood, 2011). The primary 
advantage of using multiple imputations to handle miss-
ing data revolves around its use of random components 
incorporated into the estimates of missing values drawn 
from a distribution which allows inferences to be made 
from a stochastic method rather than through a method 
derived from strong (and often incorrect) assumptions, 
such as listwise deletion or hot-deck imputation. As rec-
ommended, 20 cycles were completed for five imputed 
data sets using the “ice” command in Stata (Royston, 
2011).
Standardized BMI. Data were combined from each wave 
to support a continuous time analysis of respondents’ dif-
fering life stages before fatherhood and after fatherhood. 
BMI was standardized for all men at each wave. The 
mean estimate of each covariate on this standardized 
BMI variable was calculated for each fatherhood group 
over fatherhood years using a generalized estimating 
equation specifying an exchangeable correlation struc-
ture, normal distribution, and identity link, an approach 
commonly used (Chen & Chantala, 2014; Duncan et al., 
2006; Garfield et al., 2014). A spline model was estimated 
with one knot modeling two mutually exclusive time cat-
egory intervals: pre-fatherhood (−9 to 0 fatherhood years) 
and fatherhood (0 to +10 fatherhood years). Add Health 
intentionally oversampled adolescents from various eco-
nomic and racial/ethnic subgroups (Chen & Chantala, 
2014); therefore, study-supplied weights, which also 
account for nonresponse and attrition and allowed for the 
sample to be representative of the adolescent population 
at baseline, were included. Analyses were conducted in 
Stata/SE 12.1 (StataCorp, 2012).
Results
Descriptive Statistics and BMI Proportional 
Representation
Of 10,253 men in the sample, 6,828 (66.5%) were nonfa-
thers and 3,425 (33.5%) were fathers by Wave IV (Table 1). 
Of those fathers, 686 (20.03%) were nonresident and 2,739 
(79.97%) were resident at the time of the child’s birth. 
Most resident fathers were married (78%) compared with 
nonresident fathers (8%) and nonfathers (13%). 
Additional demographic and health characteristics are 
reported in Table 1.
BMI Over Fatherhood Years
Age plays a major factor in BMI trajectory and was posi-
tively associated with BMI over all fatherhood years for 
all young men (β = .014; 95% confidence interval, CI 
[.010, .018]; Table 2). Change in BMI for nonfathers is 
due solely to age; comparing nonresident and resident 
 Garfield et al. 
N161
fathers with nonfathers reveals different trajectories 
based on fatherhood status (Figure 1). While all young 
men’s BMI changes over time, the way it changes is con-
tingent on fatherhood status and whether they become 
nonresident or resident fathers.
For young men who were nonfathers during the entire 
study period, BMI trends reveal that BMI slope did not 
statistically change before the age of 23 years and had a 
0.04 SD decrease each year from age 23 until the end of 
the study (β = −.038; 95% CI [−.043, −.033]). The change 
in this time period is solely due to age. The mean BMI 
level for nonfathers conditioned on all of the independent 
variables increased by 0.29 SDs from the beginning of the 
study until age 23 and decreased by 0.02 SDs from age 23 
until the end of the study. Since an SD of BMI repre-
sented roughly 4.5 units throughout the study, nonfathers 
therefore increased on average by 1.31 units from the 
entrance of the study to age 23—an increase of 6% in 
BMI—and decreased on average by 0.1 unit (less than 
1%) from age 23 until the end of the study.
Young men who would become nonresident fathers had 
a decrease in BMI when compared with nonfathers in the

0.07 SDs (0.32 BMI units) from the beginning of the 
study until entrance into fatherhood, a 1.5% decrease, and 
increased on average by 0.1 SDs (0.45 BMI units or 2%) 
from entrance into fatherhood until the end of the study.
Young men who would become resident fathers start 
with a BMI 8% higher than the comparison group of non-
fathers (β = .076). The BMI slope for this group in the 
pre-fatherhood period was 0.02 SDs lower compared 
with nonfathers each year (β = −.017; 95% CI [−.021, 
−.014]) in the pre-fatherhood period. Once entering 
fatherhood, resident fathers had a slope that was 0.02 SDs 
higher than that of nonfathers (β = .022; 95% CI [.015, 
.029]). Therefore, resident fathers increased on average 
by 0.12 SDs (0.54 BMI units or 2%) from the beginning 
of the study until entrance into fatherhood and had a 
larger increase on average by 0.13 SDs (0.59 BMI units 
or 2.6%) from entrance into fatherhood until the end of 
the study.
In addition to these main findings, men of different 
races were all statistically significantly different from 
Whites with Asians having lower BMI and Blacks, 
Latinos, and other races having higher BMI (Table 2). 
Self-reported general health, mother’s education, and 
daily activities had negative associations with BMI. 
Income, marriage, and screen hours were all positively 
associated with BMI.
Discussion
In this first study of its kind examining young men’s BMI 
and fatherhood status in a nationally representative sam-
ple examined over a 20-year span, young men follow dif-
ferent weight gain paths based on their fatherhood status. 
While the BMI for all young men increases with age, 
there is a clear difference between the BMI trajectories of 
young men who enter fatherhood compared with those 
who do not. The entrance into fatherhood is associated 
with an increase in BMI trajectory regardless of father-
hood residency status, while those men who do not 
become fathers actually see an absolute decrease after 
age 23 (i.e., the post-fatherhood period of the study). 
Despite initial differences in BMI trajectories among the 
two fatherhood groups—wherein nonresident fathers 
exhibit increases and resident fathers exhibit decreases in 
BMI—following the transition to fatherhood, both groups 
exhibit increases in BMI of similar magnitudes.
Adolescent and early adulthood BMI often sets a 
course for men from which it is hard to deviate. While 
prior research examining men’s health and BMI trajecto-
ries point to increased heart, metabolic, cancer, and death 
risk (Baker et al., 2007; Flegal et al., 2013; Han et al., 
2014; Jeffreys et al., 2003; McGill et al., 2002; Schmidt 
et al., 2013; Schmidt et al., 2014; Yarnell et al., 2000), 
these studies have not accounted for the influence of a 
major social and developmental milestone, the transition 
to fatherhood. Including fatherhood status and time in 
fatherhood is essential to understand how social charac-
teristics may alter young men’s health, ultimately leading 
to innovative interventions and prevention.
As evidenced by this study, how young men’s BMI 
changes is influenced by when they become fathers and 
the type of father they become, either nonresident or resi-
dent. Prior to fatherhood, the BMI changes are in oppo-
site directions for the two fatherhood groups, but after 
fatherhood both fatherhood groups have increasing BMI 
trajectories while nonfathers have decreasing BMIs. 
Though this change may appear small, it is important to 
remember the study examines mean estimates of BMI on 
a population level and therefore may provide conserva-
tive estimates. Nevertheless, becoming a father increases 
the BMI trajectories of young men.
Nonresident fathers achieve the lowest BMI immedi-
ately prior to entering fatherhood, suggesting an ideal 
time to focus clinically on health behaviors in this popu-
lation. Nonresident fathers are already known to be at risk 
for lower education and income, which is associated with 
poor health; in this study, when controlling for these vari-
ables, this population is further at risk for increased BMI 
in early fatherhood. Prior research reports these men see 
becoming a father as motivation for positive change 
(Bozett, 1985; Cowan, 1988; Daniels & Weingarten, 
1988; Palkovitz, 2002; Palkovitz, Copes, & Woolfolk, 
2001; Strauss & Goldberg, 1999). For these men, being 
present in the health care system as pediatric chaperones 
may afford an opportunity for health education and coun-
seling and has implications for family-centered care in 
pediatrics and family medicine.
Resident fathers in this study are the only group to 
have BMI increases before and after the transition to 
fatherhood. Examined by groups, resident fathers have 
the biggest increase overall and see the greatest increase 
in early fatherhood. Prior research reports becoming a 
father is a time when men attempt to improve their diets, 
increase physical activity, decrease alcohol use, and 
lower risk-taking behavior (Garfield, Isacco, & Bartlo, 
2010; Guralnik, Butterworth, Patel, Mishra, & Kuh, 
2009; Ringbäck Weitoft, Burström, & Rosén, 2004; 
Umberson, 1992; Umberson, Liu, & Powers, 2009; 
Weitoft, Haglund, Hjern, & Rosén, 2002); yet the increase 
in this study is evidence that these changes in health 
behaviors may have little impact. The majority of resi-
dent fathers in this study were married, an association in 
other research that has been reported to be advantageous 
in terms of education, income, and physical and mental 
health (Waite, 1995). In this study, marriage is associated 
with increased BMI, findings supported by other work 
(albeit without regard for fatherhood status; Brown, 2011; 
Jeffery & Rick, 2002). This may be due to unaccounted 
 N164 
American Journal of Men’s Health 10(6)
for changes in eating habits associated with marriage and 
parenting with potentially different kinds of foods, por-
tions, and leftovers available; anecdotal evidence does 
exist of fathers cleaning their children’s dinner plates.
For nonfathers, early adolescence sees the highest 
increase in BMI followed by a lower increase in late ado-
lescence and relative decrease in early adulthood. Though 
this study followed men until an average age of 29 years, 
it is important to recognize that many of these men will 
become fathers later in life. Thus, from a preventive and 
public health perspective, the implications are that by 
identifying these young men when they are at highest risk 
(i.e., during early adolescence) and implementing weight-
related interventions and education at this time may offer 
the best potential to improve their own health and 
decrease negative influences on future BMI.
In addition to focusing on fatherhood as a social deter-
minant, this study included a number of other social and 
contextual characteristics that were significantly associ-
ated with men’s BMI. Compared with Hispanic and Black 
men, those reporting poorer health and those with lower 
income had higher BMI, results supported by prior 
research (Bronte-Tinkew, Zaslow, Capps, Horowitz, & 
McNamara, 2007; Lawlor et al., 2003; Månsdotter, 
Lindholm, & Winkvist, 2007; Nomaguchi & Milkie, 
2003). As would be expected, young men with more daily 
activities and fewer sedentary hours in front of screens 
(e.g., television, computer) had improved BMIs. This 
study adds to the debate around whether or not marriage 
is protective for men’s health, as married young men in 
this study have increased BMIs. Future study of the inter-
relationship between marriage, father’s residential status, 
and BMI is warranted.
From a clinical perspective as different subpopula-
tions of men see fluctuations in BMI at different points 
over time, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to address 
these increases in weight. From a life course theory per-
spective, however, appropriately timed preventive efforts 
such as nutritional counseling and health promotion edu-
cation that take into account developmentally significant 
stages may have enhanced potential for improving long-
term outcomes and decreasing disparities (Cabrera, 
Fagan, & Farrie, 2008; Elder, 1998; Heckman, 2006; 
Robertson, Douglas, Ludbrook, Reid, & Teijlingen, 
2008). The transition to fatherhood is one such time 
period where behavioral interventions (e.g., smoking ces-
sation) for fathers may be especially welcome and effec-
tive (Robertson et al., 2008). There is mounting anecdotal 
evidence that expectant fathers are accompanying their 
partners to obstetric visits, yet another venue to consider 
finding ways to engage young men in the health care sys-
tem. Health policy initiatives such as the Affordable Care 
Act (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010) 
may also hold promise for improving access for young 
men who are less likely to have a primary care physician, 
to have seen a provider in the past year, and to have insur-
ance compared with women (Garfield et al., 2006; 
Garfield, Isacco, & Rogers, 2012). Early results from the 
Affordable Care Act report a decrease in uninsured adults 
of child-rearing ages potentially alleviating insurance as a 
barrier to health care (Sommers et al., 2014 ).
The influence of fathers’ weight on children’s out-
comes is just one more reason to focus preventive efforts 
on young men. In families with an overweight father and 
a normal weight mother, the odds of having an obese 
child 4 years later were 4.18 times greater compared with 
two normal weight parents, and, if the father was obese, 
the odds rose to 14.88 times greater (Freeman et al., 
2012). Notably, having a normal weight father and an 
overweight/obese mother was not a significant predictor 
of child obesity (Freeman et al., 2012). Paternal behav-
iors have also been reported to increase the risk of obesity 
in preschoolers more than maternal behaviors (Wake, 
Nicholson, Hardy, & Smith, 2007). With the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention reporting 96% of resi-
dent fathers and 30% of nonresident fathers ate a meal 
with their <5-year-old child every day or several times a 
week (Jones & Mosher, 2013), there is ample opportunity 
for influence. The Healthy Dads, Healthy Kids program 
in Australia proved the feasibility and efficacy of target-
ing fathers to lose weight and be a role model for their 
children (Morgan et al., 2014). The Healthy Dads, 
Healthy Kids program resulted in significant weight loss 
and improved health-related outcomes in fathers and 
improved eating and physical activity among children 
(Morgan et al., 2011). Thus, targeting fathers during this 
developmental stage may be an especially efficacious 
approach to improving men’s and children’s health.
Limitations
The first wave of Add Health calculated BMI based on 
self-report; all later waves were interviewer collected and 
may be more accurate. Inferences for this study are lim-
ited to the average change in BMI during a certain period 
given certain characteristics. The model predicts at a pop-
ulation level and is unable to predict individual trajecto-
ries or estimate how changes in a particular covariate can 
affect the change of an individual’s BMI. Another limita-
tion is the restriction of fatherhood status to one category 
over the study period despite recognizing that resident 
status change may potentially affect BMI and health. 
Future research with longer post-fatherhood transition 
study windows might better shed light on these shifts and 
BMI. Finally, the Add Health sample follows men through 
their 20s and into the 30s and is unable as of yet to exam-
ine the transition to parenthood for older fathers. 
Nevertheless, resident fathers’ age of fatherhood entry in 
 Garfield et al. 
N165
Add Health, 25 years, is the same as the National Survey 
of Family Growth’s age at first birth for men from 2006 
to 2010 (Martinez, Daniels, & Chandra, 2012).
Conclusion
Understanding the influence social characteristics have 
on young men’s BMI over time is a first step toward 
addressing unmet health needs for young men as they get 
older. These findings support the need for obesity preven-
tion interventions specifically designed for and targeted 
toward young males in general and those transitioning to 
fatherhood in particular. Such interventions could begin 
in adolescence and carry through young adulthood, tar-
geting the distinctive needs and concerns of young men 
over the life course.
