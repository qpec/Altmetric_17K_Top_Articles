ABSTRACT
Objectives. The mortality rate of a street-recruited homeless youth cohort in the United
States has not yet been reported. We examined the six-year mortality rate for a cohort
of street youth recruited from San Francisco street venues in 2004.
Methods. Using data collected from a longitudinal, venue-based sample of street youth
15–24 years of age, we calculated age, race, and gender-adjusted mortality rates.
Results. Of a sample of 218 participants, 11 died from enrollment in 2004 to December
31, 2010. The majority of deaths were due to suicide and/or substance abuse. The death
rate was 9.6 deaths per hundred thousand person-years. The age, race and gender-
adjusted standardized mortality ratio was 10.6 (95% CI [5.3–18.9]). Gender specific
SMRs were 16.1 (95% CI [3.3–47.1]) for females and 9.4 (95% CI [4.0–18.4]) for males.
Conclusions. Street-recruited homeless youth in San Francisco experience a mortality
rate in excess of ten times that of the state’s general youth population. Services and
programs, particularly housing, mental health and substance abuse interventions, are
urgently needed to prevent premature mortality in this vulnerable population.

INTRODUCTION
Homeless youth experience a disproportionate risk for morbidity, including, but not limited
to, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, Hepatitis B and C, and psychiatric
disorders (DeMatteo et al., 1999; Ensign & Gittelsohn, 1998; Hahn et al., 2001; Kennedy,
1991; Larkin Steet Youth Services, 2014; Noell et al., 2001; Roy et al., 1999). Homeless adults
have been shown to experience increased mortality (Hwang, 2000; Nordentoft & Wandall-
Holm, 2003; Alstrom, Lindelius & Salum, 1975; Babidge, Buhrich & Butler, 2001; Barrow
et al., 1999; Beijer et al., 2011; Cheung & Hwang, 2004; Hibbs et al., 1994; Hwang et al.,
1997; Metraux et al., 2011; Nielsen et al., 2011; Shaw & Dorling, 1998; Baggett et al., 2013;
Nusselder et al., 2013). This elevated risk of mortality may be especially high amongst
homeless youth. Table 1 summarizes the existing published findings regarding street youth
mortality rates and standardized mortality rates in Europe, North America, and Australia.
Of the studies that have examined rates of mortality among adult homeless populations,
How to cite this article Auerswald et al. (2016), Six-year mortality in a street-recruited cohort of homeless youth in San Francisco, Cali-
fornia. PeerJ 4:e1909; DOI 10.7717/peerj.1909
 eleven have presented data for a youth subgroup within the sample (Hwang, 2000;
Nordentoft & Wandall-Holm, 2003; Alstrom, Lindelius & Salum, 1975; Babidge, Buhrich
& Butler, 2001; Barrow et al., 1999; Hibbs et al., 1994; Hwang et al., 1997; Metraux et al.,
2011; Nielsen et al., 2011; Shaw & Dorling, 1998; Nusselder et al., 2013). Of those reporting
age- and gender-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMR), youth SMRs ranged from
2.1 to 37.32, generally higher than the SMRs found amongst older participants in the same
studies (Hwang, 2000; Nordentoft & Wandall-Holm, 2003; Alstrom, Lindelius & Salum,
1975; Babidge, Buhrich & Butler, 2001; Barrow et al., 1999; Hibbs et al., 1994; Hwang et al.,
1997; Roy et al., 2010; Roy et al., 2004).
Of note, a census-based study of life expectancies in Canada found that a 25-year old
male living in shelters, rooming houses, or hotels had a 32% chance of surviving to the age
of 75, as compared to 51% of housed males living in the lowest fifth income bracket (Hwang
et al., 2009). A national registry-based study of homeless persons in Denmark found that
the remaining life expectancy for individuals who first accessed shelter between the ages of
15–24 was 38.7 years for men and 47.4 years for women, compared to 60.3 and 64.8 years
respectively for the general population of Danish men and women (Nielsen et al., 2011).
Investigators in Montreal have focused specifically on street youth, conducting two five-year
prospective cohort studies with youth initially recruited from service agencies at ages 14–25
(Roy et al., 2010; Roy et al., 2004; Roy et al., 1998). Roy and colleagues found an SMR of
15.3 in their first cohort tracked from 1995–2000, and a subsequent 79% mortality rate
decrease to an SMR of 3.0 in their second cohort tracked from 2001–2006, attributed to an
improvement in local services to help the homeless and injection drug using populations.
Although the United States and Canada are geographically and economically similar, the
national health care system and broader social safety net in Canada offers a substantially
different context and resources for youth homelessness in the two countries. Thus, mortality
rates found in Canada may not be comparable to those in the US. Of the four existing
US-based studies that presented youth-specific mortality data, three were conducted prior
to 2000. All four were retrospective studies of homeless adults including youth over the ages
of 15 or 18, whose names were collected from shelter or service utilization records (Barrow
et al., 1999; Hibbs et al., 1994; Hwang et al., 1997; Metraux et al., 2011).
A limitation of all of the studies listed in Table 1 is the use of convenience samples
recruited from service providers, such as shelters and clinics. A challenge to recruiting
street youth is that they are less likely to access services than homeless adults, making
service-based sampling less likely to be representative of a homeless youth population
than for adults. Our prior research suggests this may be particularly true of homeless
African American youth, who were far less likely to access services for homeless youth
than were their white counterparts (Hickler & Auerswald, 2009). Similarly, we found in
another study that homeless youth recruited during street outreach had higher rates of
high-risk sexual and drug-related behaviors than youth recruited from local clinics for
homeless youth (Auerswald et al., 2007). Given the challenges to recruiting members of a
hard-to-reach population that cannot be enumerated using conventional methods, other
approaches, including venue-based sampling, have been proposed to recruit a purposive

 sample (Auerswald et al., 2004; Minnis et al., 2002; MacKellar et al., 1996; Muhib et al.,
2001; Stueve et al., 2001; Kral et al., 2010).
We undertook the current study to assess the standardized mortality ratios for a six-year
prospective cohort of homeless youth recruited entirely from street sites, using venue-based
sampling in San Francisco in 2004.
METHODS
The Street Youth in Social Environments (Street Y-SE) study was a longitudinal study
which examined the relationships among street culture, social networks and STI/HIV
risk in San Francisco homeless youth. Recruitment, sampling, and study methods have
been previously described (Hickler & Auerswald, 2009; Parriott & Auerswald, 2009). We
employed venue-based sampling, a method of accessing both service-engaged and non-
engaged hard-to-reach populations, such as homeless youth, by recruiting them at the
venues where they spend time (for example, street corners or parks) (Auerswald et al.,
2004; Minnis et al., 2002; MacKellar et al., 1996; Muhib et al., 2001; Stueve et al., 2001; Kral
et al., 2010). Prior to enrollment, we conducted a mixed qualitative–quantitative assessment
of venues to inform the selection of our recruitment sites. Based on street observations and
ethnographic interviews with homeless youth, providers and outreach workers, a list of 62
preliminary venues was compiled. Brief street interviews were subsequently conducted at
each venue to characterize the volume and composition of the youth population at each
site. Based on these findings, the final list of venues was narrowed to 28, based on gender
composition, number of youth and redundancy. Our approach to venue selection was
adapted from a prior study (Auerswald et al., 2004; Minnis et al., 2002).
Because youth are often intermittently homeless, eligibility was limited to youth who
were 15–24 years of age and who had experienced unstable housing in the prior six months,
defined as ‘‘having to stay two nights or more in a place that is not your home because you
could not stay in your home or you did not have a home, including having to stay in one
of the following places: a shelter, outdoors, a squat, with a stranger or someone you did
not know well, a car, on public transportation, or SRO/hotel.’’ Exclusion criteria included
being actively under the influence of alcohol or illicit substances, or being too distressed or
agitated to participate in the interview. Youth provided written informed consent for their
participation.
Study participants completed audio computer-assisted self-interviews (ACASI) at the
time of enrollment. Interviews were conducted in English. Gender (male, female, or
transgender), race/ethnicity, and age were self-reported. Youth were allowed to report
up to six racial categories (Black/African American, White/European American, Native
American/Alaskan, Latino/Hispanic, Pacific Islander/Polynesian, Asian/Asian–American,
Mixed) or ‘‘Don’t Know’’ or ‘‘Refuse.’’ Interviews also recorded information regarding
characteristics such as youth’s housing history, service or health care utilization, sexual
and substance use patterns, education, and experiences while on the street (Hickler &
Auerswald, 2009; Parriott & Auerswald, 2009).
Deaths were tracked via the National Death Index (NDI), a nationwide index of
death certificate data, through the end of 2010. Causes of death were determined by
Auerswald et al. (2016), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.1909
4/13
 NDI-Plus. Methods for identifying a match are described in detail on the NDI website
(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ndi.htm). The index was queried and matches were made using
legal names, aliases, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers, as reported by study
participants. Follow-up time began on the date of enrollment into the study, and ended
either at death or on December 31, 2010.
To calculate a standardized mortality ratio, youth were divided into 32 strata based
on age (15–24 or 25–34 years old), sex (male or female, as no street-recruited youth
identified as transgender) and race/ethnicity. We employed these age strata as they are
those employed in the reporting of California mortality rates (California Department of
Public Health, 2016). For this analysis, all persons who reported more than one racial
category or chose ‘‘mixed’’ as their primary racial identity were classified as ‘‘two or more
races’’ and all persons who reported ‘‘don’t know’’ or ‘‘refuse’’ or left the race/ethnicity
question blank were considered to be of ‘‘unknown’’ race or ethnicity. As there were no
Asian/Asian American youth in our sample, only seven race/ethnicity categories were
included. For stratum-specific comparison mortality rates, we used the mean mortality
rate for California for the years 2004 through 2010 (California Department of Public Health,
2016). For the four strata of youth of unknown race/ethnicity, we employed the overall
California youth population of the same age and sex as our reference population for the
SMR. SAS version 9.3 was used to calculate stratum specific follow-up time, and expected
deaths were calculated using Excel. The SMR and Fisher’s exact 95% confidence intervals
were calculated using OpenEpi version 3.03 (Dean, Sullivan & Soe, 2014).
We examined the bivariate relationship of demographic and behavioral variables to
mortality using Fischer’s 2-sided exact test.
The protocol was approved by the Committee for Human Subjects of the University of
California at San Francisco (Study Number 11-05254).
RESULTS
Our street-recruited sample included 218 youth. One hundred and forty three (65.6%)
were male and 75 (34.4%) were female. The mean sample age at baseline was 20.5 years,
with a standard deviation of 2.1 years. The sample was 50.5% non-Latino/white, 14.7%
non-Latino Black, 26.6% multi-racial, 2.8% Native American, 1.4% Latino, 0.9% Pacific
Islander, and 3.2% unknown.
The cohort accrued a total of 1,150.8 years of follow-up. There were a total of 11 deaths
for a death rate of 9.6 deaths per thousand person-years of follow-up. Of the 11 deaths, 8
were male and 3 were female; 8 were non-Latino/Hispanic white and 3 were of mixed race.
The age, race, and sex standardized mortality ratio for the entire sample was 10.6 (95% CI
[5.3–18.9]). The gender specific SMRs were 16.1 (95% CI [3.3–47.1]) for females and 9.4
(95% CI [4.0–18.4] for males.
Six out of eleven of the deaths occurred outside of California. Causes of death by ICD-10
code (the information provided by the NDI database) are listed in Table 2. The majority
of deaths were suicides and/or alcohol- or drug-related. Our definition of alcohol- or
drug-related deaths corresponds with that of the Center for Disease Control’s Division of
Vital Statistics (Kochanek et al., 2011).

bThough there were not missing data for other questions, there were missing data for men reporting having sex with men
(39/143). However, all male decedents responded.

and survivors. No demographic or behavioral factor had a statistically significant (Fisher’s
2-sided exact p < 0.05) or marginally significant (p < 0.1) association with mortality.
However, there was a trend towards an association with injection drug use (IDU)
with 63.6% of decedents vs. 36.2% of survivors having had a history of IDU (p = .11)
(Jepsen et al., 2004).

our cohort were suicide and/or alcohol- or drug-related, similar to those observed in some
previous studies (Hwang, 2000; Roy et al., 2004; Evans et al., 2012).
Although the standardized mortality ratio we found was higher than relative mortality
measures from previous US studies that relied on service based sampling (Barrow et al.,
1999; Hibbs et al., 1994; Hwang et al., 1997), these SMRs are not directly comparable. As
these studies were not all standardized to the same population, differences between effect
measures may occur due to differences in the demographic profiles of the study samples,
in addition to differences in the stratum specific relative risks of mortality.
The females in our study cohort experienced a non-significant trend towards a higher
mean excess risk of mortality than the males. However, all previous studies calculating
gender specific SMRs but one (where there were no female decedents) have reported a higher
point estimate for the SMR for females than for males (Nordentoft & Wandall-Holm, 2003;
Babidge, Buhrich & Butler, 2001; Hwang et al., 1997; Roy et al., 2004; Evans et al., 2012).
Our study adds to the literature in several ways. To our knowledge this is the first
prospective cohort study of the mortality of street youth in the United States, and
furthermore, the only such mortality study to have recruited participants entirely through
street-based venues, rather than service or shelter-based sampling. Our findings are thus
more likely to reflect the risk of mortality of a youth found in a street setting versus a youth
who has already accessed services. A further strength of our study is that we adjusted our
Auerswald et al. (2016), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.1909
7/13
 SMRs for age, race and sex, unlike most prior studies which have been simply age and
sex-adjusted. Given the recognized disparities in US mortality by race/ethnicity, this is an
important addition to current analyses (Mulye et al., 2009).
The limitations of our study should be considered. Though venue-based sampling
allows for a more representative sample of participants than samples recruited through
service providers, it remains a non-random sample with limited generalizability. The
English language requirement for interview participation may have excluded potential
Spanish-speaking or other monolingual participants, impacting the representativeness
of this study. However, the venues where we recruited youth were generally not venues
frequented by street-based monolingual Spanish-speaking youth, who tend to congregate
in neighborhoods distinct from the neighborhoods where the Y-SE study was conducted.
The exclusion of youth under the influence of substances or exhibiting emotional distress
or agitation at the point of recruitment may have excluded youth with a higher propensity
toward substance abuse or serious mental health issues, thus potentially underestimating
deaths. However, we recorded only one youth who was excluded for this reason (due to
persistent psychosis).
Our study was conducted in San Francisco, a city with a relative wealth of resources for
the homeless (Department of Housing and Urban Development, 2015). Thus, although half
of the reported deaths occurred outside of California, the experiences and rate of mortality
experienced by our participants may not be generalizable to homeless youth from elsewhere
in the United States.
Furthermore, we may have missed cases of deaths through incomplete or incorrect
identifying information for participants, deaths outside of the United States, or deaths that
were not captured in the NDI. However as undercounting deaths in the cohort would lead
us to underestimate mortality rates for homeless youth, any bias would be towards the null.
Finally, because we were only able to adjust for age, race, and gender, there is possibility of
confounding in our SMR estimate.
Though it is not a limitation, a cautionary note is indicated here. The SMRs that we
report should not be directly compared to those in the table, nor should the SMRs in the
table be compared to each other without a clear understanding that the referring group is
different for each of the papers. Thus, we can only state that youth in each location had a
higher or lower mortality rate, relative to its own referent population, not to each other’s
rate.
Despite these limitations, our findings hold important potential policy implications,
particularly given the federal commitment to ending youth homelessness by 2020 (United
States Interagency Council on Homelessness, 2016). While our results, and the results of
previous studies, do not conclusively prove that youth homelessness causes excess mortality,
it does seem reasonable to assume that homelessness among youth is an indicator of high
mortality risk. Even if the association between homelessness and mortality is not causal, the
high mortality rate in this cohort of young homeless men and women is a stark reminder
that interventions to reduce premature death in street youth are needed. Studies of adults
have suggested that providing long-term housing decreases mortality (Metraux et al., 2011).
Provision of housing is likely to be life-saving for youth as well.
Auerswald et al. (2016), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.1909
8/13
 Although rates of IDU were higher among decedents (63.6%) than among those who
survived (36.2%), IDU was not significantly associated with mortality (p = .11). However,
we did not have enough outcomes to definitively determine or refute this relationship.
Additional data would be necessary to definitively determine a causal relationship between
IDU and the increased risk of death among street-recruited homeless youth. Nevertheless,
the high rate of IDU among decedents is consistent with prior findings of a high rate of
mortality among injection-drug using youth in San Francisco (Evans et al., 2012). Our
findings support the development of mental health, harm reduction, and other substance
use interventions tailored to street youth as a public health priority for this population
(Seal et al., 2005). Roy and colleagues in Montreal have suggested that the drop in mortality
rates among their cohorts may have been due in part to new services for homeless youth
implemented during this time, particularly suicide-prevention services (Roy et al., 2010).
Further research is warranted to explore the predictors of mortality among youth, in
particular the reasons why females may have a higher SMR than males. Should a gender
difference prove to be significant, this may reflect differences in the effect of the street social
environment on the health of males versus females (Bourgois, Prince & Moss, 2004; Valente
& Auerswald, 2013). Such information may help inform the development of appropriate,
sub-group specific services for this group of highly marginalized, highly vulnerable youth.
Given that these youth come disproportionately from groups for which society has a
fiduciary responsibility, including survivors of physical and sexual abuse, foster youth and
youth with a history of involvement in the juvenile justice system, our collective mandate
to address their disparity in mortality is even more pressing.
