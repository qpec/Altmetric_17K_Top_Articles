 Hematuria as a Marker of Occult Urinary Tract Cancer: Advice for
High-Value Care From the American College of Physicians
Matthew Nielsen, MD, MS, and Amir Qaseem, MD, PhD, for the High Value Care Task Force of the American College of
Physicians*
Background: The presence of blood in the urine, or hematuria,
is a common finding in clinical practice and can sometimes be a
sign of occult cancer. This article describes the clinical epidemi-
ology of hematuria and the current state of practice and science
in this context and provides suggestions for clinicians evaluating
patients with hematuria.
Methods: A narrative review of available clinical guidelines and
other relevant studies on the evaluation of hematuria was con-
ducted, with particular emphasis on considerations for urologic
referral.
High-Value Care Advice 1: Clinicians should include gross he-
maturia in their routine review of systems and specifically ask all
patients with microscopic hematuria about any history of gross
hematuria.
High-Value Care Advice 2: Clinicians should not use screening
urinalysis for cancer detection in asymptomatic adults.
High-Value Care Advice 3: Clinicians should confirm heme-
positive results of dipstick testing with microscopic urinalysis that
demonstrates 3 or more erythrocytes per high-powered field be-
fore initiating further evaluation in all asymptomatic adults.
High-Value Care Advice 4: Clinicians should refer for further
urologic evaluation in all adults with gross hematuria, even if
self-limited.
High-Value Care Advice 5: Clinicians should consider urology
referral for cystoscopy and imaging in adults with microscopically
confirmed hematuria in the absence of some demonstrable be-
nign cause.
High-Value Care Advice 6: Clinicians should pursue evaluation
of hematuria even if the patient is receiving antiplatelet or antico-
agulant therapy.
High-Value Care Advice 7: Clinicians should not obtain urinary
cytology or other urine-based molecular markers for bladder can-
cer detection in the initial evaluation of hematuria.

H
ematuria is frequently encountered among adults
in ambulatory care (1, 2). Despite the absence of
recommendations for hematuria screening (3, 4), mil-
lions of patients have urine dipstick testing and micro-
scopic examinations as part of routine primary care
practice (5, 6). The frequency of urinalysis with the pri-
mary intent of cancer screening is unknown; however,
hematuria may often be an incidental finding on tests
pursued for other purposes, given the multiplex nature
of dipstick tests. Referral series underscore the poten-
tial for a positive test result to be the presenting sign of
occult cancer, and existing hematuria guidelines em-
phasize structured urologic investigation related to this
risk with endoscopy of the bladder (cystoscopy), imag-
ing, and potentially other diagnostic tests and proce-
dures. However, the magnitude of the risk for underly-
ing cancer varies greatly (7–9), and the quality of
evidence informing practice creates uncertainty.
Hematuria occasionally has a dramatic presenta-
tion as grossly visible blood in the urine. Symptomatic
gross hematuria with associated flank pain or renal
colic is the classic presentation of urinary stone disease,
whereas painless gross hematuria has a stronger asso-
ciation with cancer. Any episode of gross hematuria in
an adult warrants consideration of urgent urologic eval-
uation, given the relatively high pretest probability of
cancer or other clinically significant underlying condi-
tions (consistently >10% [7, 8, 10] and >25% in some
referral series [9]). Asymptomatic microscopic hematu-
ria (AMH) is more commonly encountered, with preva-
lence estimated at 0.9% to 18.0% in the adult popula-
tion (1, 2). Patients referred for AMH have a relatively
lower (0.5% to 5.0%) but nontrivial probability of under-
lying occult cancer (2, 7–15) that is estimated to range
from 7% to greater than 20% in higher-risk subgroups
in some series (9, 16–18).
Against this backdrop, a review of current clinical
practice suggests substantial unexplained variation in
referral practices for patients with hematuria (8, 19–27),
highlighting opportunities to increase awareness and
define a high-value strategy to evaluate hematuria.

 of hematuria as a marker of occult urinary tract cancer
and other relevant studies from the peer-reviewed lit-
erature. This article was prepared with the intent to in-
crease awareness and provide practical advice based
on the best available evidence but was not based on a
formal systematic review.
This article was reviewed and approved by the
American College of Physicians' High Value Care Task
Force, whose members are physicians trained in inter-
nal medicine and its subspecialties and which includes
experts in evidence synthesis. The Task Force devel-
oped the high-value care advice statements based on
the narrative review of the literature. At each confer-
ence call, all members of the High Value Care Task
Force declared all financial and nonfinancial interests.
The target audience for this article is all internists, fam-
ily physicians, and other clinicians, and the target pa-
tient population is adults with hematuria. The purpose
of this article is to describe indications for the evalua-
tion of hematuria as a marker of occult urinary tract
cancer and to help clinicians make high-value decisions
about referral of patients for urologic assessment.
WHAT ARE THE CURRENT EVIDENCE-BASED
GUIDELINES FOR THE APPROPRIATE
EVALUATION OF PATIENTS WITH HEMATURIA?
Screening healthy, asymptomatic patients with uri-
nalysis for the purpose of cancer detection is not cur-
rently recommended by any major health organization.
This topic has been evaluated by the U.S. Preventive
Services Task Force, which issued an “I” recommenda-
tion because of insufficient evidence on the benefits
and harms (3). Neither the American Urological Associ-
ation (AUA) nor the Canadian Task Force on the Peri-
odic Health Examination recommends this practice (4,
12). A large case–control study of healthy adults receiv-
ing urinalysis as part of a health screening illustrates the
limitations of population-based urinalysis screening,
with no significant difference in incidence of cancer be-
tween those with and without dipstick-positive hematu-
ria (screening had a sensitivity of 2.9% and a positive
predictive value of 0.2% to 0.5% for cancer) (28).
Although little controversy surrounds the indication
for urologic evaluation for patients with gross hematu-
ria, the evaluation of patients with the more common
finding of AMH is complicated by a lack of clarity about
indications for referral and optimal components of the
evaluation (Table 1). Many organizations have promul-
gated recommendations and algorithms relevant to the
evaluation of patients with AMH. In contrast to the AUA
(29), the Canadian Urological Association (CUA) (30),
and the Dutch guidelines (31), the British Association of
Urological Surgeons (BAUS) specifically recommends
evaluation based on a result of at least 1+ heme on a
chemical dipstick test and recommends against pro-
ceeding to confirmatory microscopy as an intermediate
step (32). A microscopic examination of the urinary sed-
iment from a freshly voided, clean-catch, midstream
urine specimen is recommended to determine the
presence of AMH. The threshold of at least 3 erythro-
cytes per high-powered field (HPF) is consistent across
most of the guidelines, and the requirement for micro-
scopic confirmation in this context was selected by the
AUA as a Choosing Wisely statement in 2015 (33). In a
departure from the CUA and Dutch guidelines (30, 31)
and the prior AUA best practice policy (16), which rec-
ommended microscopic confirmation on at least 2 of 3
specimens, the current AUA guideline suggests pro-
ceeding with evaluation on the basis of a single positive
result on a microscopic analysis (12). This change was
based on the literature that underscores the potential
intermittent nature of hematuria from cancer (14, 15,
17, 18, 34, 35). Although limited, the literature that spe-
cifically examined different numerical thresholds for the
number of erythrocytes per HPF found limited discrim-
ination between incremental cut points, other than a
threshold of at least 50 erythrocytes per HPF being as-
sociated with a significantly higher risk for cancer than a
threshold of less than 50 erythrocytes per HPF (8, 9).
Whereas the AUA guidelines recommend evaluation
for patients with AMH who are older than 35 years and

 patients of any age with risk factors for cancer (Table 2)
(29, 36), the CUA and BAUS guidelines include 40 years
or older as the age threshold (30, 32) and the Dutch
guideline vignettes are framed around a cutoff of 50
years or older for the purposes of identifying the pop-
ulation at greatest risk (31). Recognizing age as a risk
factor for cancer, the U.K. National Institute for Health
and Clinical Excellence identified unexplained nonvis-
ible hematuria in patients older than 60 years as a trig-
ger for “suspected cancer pathway” referral for an ap-
pointment within 2 weeks (37).
The investigation of hematuria includes radiologic
evaluation to identify potential pathology in the upper
urinary tract. The American College of Radiology Ap-
propriateness Criteria identified multiphase computed
tomography (CT) urography as the preferred study in
the evaluation of hematuria (38). The AUA recom-
mends this method for all patients older than 35 years
with at least 3 erythrocytes per HPF and no medical
contraindications to intravenous contrast (12). The
BAUS guideline (32) makes no specific recommenda-
tion about imaging method. The Dutch and CUA
guidelines recommend ultrasonography as the first-line
imaging method, with CT urography reserved for
higher-risk cases and those with equivocal findings in
the first-line evaluation. They both explicitly cite con-
cerns related to radiation exposure and cost as the ra-
tionale for more selective use of CT imaging (30, 31).
The AUA and BAUS guidelines recommend concurrent
urologic evaluation in the presence of findings sugges-
tive of potential nephrologic disorders (such as hyper-
tension, renal insufficiency, cellular casts, proteinuria,
or dysmorphic erythrocytes), whereas the CUA and
Dutch guidelines suggest referral to a nephrologist as
an alternative starting point in such cases.
The AUA guideline makes several salient points for
clinicians to consider in the initial evaluation of AMH
(29). It specifically notes that receipt of antiplatelet or
anticoagulant therapy is not believed to be a satisfac-
tory explanation for hematuria (39–41). Another impor-
tant educational message for clinicians is that routine
cytologic evaluation of urine is no longer recom-
mended in the initial AMH evaluation, and urine mark-
ers approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administra-
tion for bladder cancer detection (NMP22 BladderChek
[Alere], BTA stat [Polymedco], ImmunoCyt [Diagno-
Cure], or UroVysion fluorescence in situ hybridization
[Abbott Molecular]) are specifically not recommended
for patients with AMH (12). This latter recommendation
is consistent with the conclusions of a recent systematic
review and meta-analysis of urinary biomarkers, which
found that they miss a substantial proportion (18% to
43%) of patients with bladder cancer and give false-
positive results in 12% to 26% of patients without blad-
der cancer (42).
WHAT HARMS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE
EVALUATION OF HEMATURIA?
Harms associated with the diagnostic investigation
of hematuria include the anxiety and discomfort associ-
ated with transurethral cystoscopy, which is routinely
done under topical anesthesia (urethral lidocaine gel)
with a flexible fiberoptic endoscope in the urology of-
fice. Complications of flexible cystoscopy are rare but
can include urinary tract infection, sepsis, and urethral
stricture (9). Estimates of the infection risk associated
with cystoscopy vary by study population and definition
of “infection,” including positive result on urinalysis (5%
to 21%) (43), bacteriuria (3% to 9%) (44), febrile urinary
tract infection (1.4% to 3.7%) (45), and symptomatic uri-
nary tract infection (0.85%) (46).
Harms associated with CT urography include ne-
phropathy from intravenous contrast and the rare but
real risk for life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions to
contrast. Contrast nephropathy may occur in up to 2%
of patients in the general population and at least 20%
of high-risk patients with congestive heart failure, dia-
betes, or chronic kidney disease (47).
In addition, increasing attention is being paid to
the potential longer-term harm of ionizing radiation ex-
posure in the context of evidence linking doses in the
range of multiphase CT scans to a significantly in-
creased risk for cancer (48). The National Research
Council concluded that patients exposed to as little as
10 mSv may have increased risk for cancer (49). The
median effective radiation dose associated with stan-
dard 3-phase CT urography has been estimated to be
20 to 30 mSv, depending on the scanner and imaging
protocol (50–52), and concerns have been raised that
the dose per examination has increased over the past
decade (53). Evidence shows substantial variation in
the effective radiation dose, with mean doses across
facilities ranging from 24 to 45 mSv and an absolute
range of 6 to 90 mSv for multiphase abdomen/pelvis
CT in 1 contemporary multicenter study (54). Multi-
phase abdomen/pelvis CT has been associated with
the highest effective dose and the highest adjusted life-
time attributable risk for cancer (4 cases per 1000 pa-
tients) among common CT protocols (54). Although
radiation-associated cancer risk has traditionally been
considered to decrease with age, recent evidence sug-

 gests that these risks may have a U-shaped distribution,
with increasing risks after exposure in middle or older
age (55). Despite the growing body of literature in this
area, evidence shows limited awareness among clini-
cians of the radiation associated with CT imaging and
its potential for carcinogenesis (56). Nevertheless, con-
cern about radiation exposure is specifically articulated
in several organizations' more selective recommenda-
tions for the use of CT imaging in evaluating hematuria
(30, 31, 57).
The downstream consequences, including costs,
associated with the management of incidental findings
of uncertain significance are other potential harms re-
lated to widespread CT imaging (58). Such findings
may lead to potentially unnecessary anxiety, expenses,
and physical risks associated with additional testing or
procedures. Although limited data exist on the magni-
tude of such downstream consequences among pa-
tients being evaluated for hematuria (59), reports from
the CT colonography literature highlight the potential
extent of these issues in a screening population receiv-
ing anatomically similar imaging (60).
WHAT ARE THE COSTS OF HEMATURIA
EVALUATION?
On both the individual and population levels, the
costs associated with hematuria evaluation can be sub-
stantial. Table 3 presents the direct costs of tests rec-
ommended for the initial urologic evaluation of hema-
turia; these may vary on the basis of the practice setting
(office- vs. hospital-based) (61–63). Even insured pa-
tients, an increasing proportion of whom are enrolled
in high-deductible health plans, may have to bear a
substantial proportion of these costs in copays and de-
ductibles (64, 65). The costs of the consulting urolo-
gist's evaluation and management services are also a
consideration, as well as any additional procedures or
tests indicated in the adjudication of uncertain or sus-
picious findings on the initial evaluation. Although cy-
tology still has a role for higher-risk patients with neg-
ative
or
equivocal
initial
evaluation
results
(29),
indiscriminate use of these tests, as suggested in some
earlier recommendations (66), could result in poten-
tially substantial direct and indirect costs and unneces-
sary anxiety.
WHAT IS THE CURRENT STATE OF PRACTICE?
Surveys of primary care physicians suggest that the
use of urinalysis in adults in ambulatory care is com-
mon, with 44% to 77% of respondents in the past
decade endorsing this as routine practice (5, 6, 20).
Although the motivation for urinalysis is not well-
characterized, data from 1 serial survey suggest that its
frequency has decreased (5). This study surveyed clini-
cians 5 times between 1978 and 2004 and found that
their endorsement of routine urinalysis decreased from
93% to 44% based on a vignette describing a healthy
35-year-old man and from 96% to 55% in a vignette of
a healthy 55-year-old woman.
When heme is detected on the chemical dipstick
test, microscopic confirmation is required (12) because
of the potential for false-positive results on up to one
third of the tests, depending on the patient population
(67, 68). Experience from urology practice supports the
observation that a substantial number of AMH referrals
may reflect an underappreciation of false-positive re-
sults, described as “dipstick pseudohematuria” (22). Al-
though the magnitude of this problem is uncertain and
may be below the 57% seen in the single study specif-
ically examining it (22), clinical experience supports the
need for increased awareness of the recommendation
for confirmatory microscopy (33).
Although false-positive results on dipstick tests
may lead to potentially avoidable referrals, there are
also concerns in the urology community that limited
awareness of the association between bona fide hema-
turia and potentially serious conditions may lead to de-
lays in referral and timely diagnosis. A survey of primary
care physicians from 2 U.S. metropolitan areas re-
ported that 64% of microscopic hematuria findings
were not routinely referred for urologic evaluation; po-
tentially
more
concerning,
given
the
substantially
higher risk for underlying cancer associated with gross
hematuria, 23% to 36% of respondents reported not
routinely referring patients with that presentation (20).
Administrative data also suggest highly variable
rates of urology referral after encounters with claims for
hematuria diagnostic codes (from 4% to 47%) (19, 21,
23, 25–27). Evidence suggests that this phenomenon
occurs even among high-risk subgroups (Table 2), with
a study of patients older than 50 years with a 10–pack-
year or greater smoking history or 15-year or greater
occupational exposure history finding referral rates of
less than 15% (24). Notwithstanding the limitations of
these observational data, the apparent variability in re-
ferral rates and possible attendant delays in diagnosis
raise concerns about potentially avoidable harms. For
example, a study from the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemi-
ology, and End Results)–Medicare data set found that
patients with a delay greater than 9 months from the
first claim for hematuria in the year before diagnosis of
bladder cancer were more likely to die of the disease
than those with an interval of 3 months or less (median

of
50.9
months
and
70.9
months, respectively [log-rank P < 0.001]) (69).

 In addition, several studies have shown that, com-
pared with men, women have substantially lower rates
of urology referral (8% to 28% vs. 36% to 47%), higher
rates of incomplete diagnostic evaluations (3.8% to
10.0% vs. 10.4% to 22.0%), and longer delays to urol-
ogy referral among patients with documented hematu-
ria (19, 26, 27). The reasons for these patterns of care
are not clear from the available literature. Although
men have a nearly 3-fold greater risk for bladder can-
cer, women typically present with more advanced dis-
ease and have a higher case-fatality rate (70), which
raises the question of whether sex disparities in access
may represent an opportunity for improvement.
WHY DOES PRACTICE NOT FOLLOW THE
EVIDENCE?
The proportion of patients undergoing urinalysis
with the intent of hematuria screening is unknown. To
the extent that the motivation for urinalysis is multifac-
torial, the survey data cited previously suggest that its
routine use has decreased in primary care practice in
recent decades (5). Nevertheless, data suggest that a
substantial proportion of patients continue to receive
this testing. The utility of urinalysis that is primarily
intended to screen for glycosuria or proteinuria, in
which the detection of hematuria may be a finding in-
cidental to the multiplex nature of the test, is beyond
the scope of this review, but such testing in the general
adult population does not seem to have high value (71,
72). Across the previously cited studies, a minority of
patients with documented hematuria were referred for
urologic evaluation for reasons that are not clear from
the available data. Although it is acknowledged that a
proportion of patients with AMH may have an identifi-
able benign cause in the initial evaluation, the level of
detail in available data is inadequate to draw conclu-
sions about the magnitude of potentially undesirable
omission of referral.
HOW CAN PHYSICIANS CHANGE THEIR OWN
PRACTICE AND PROMOTE THE APPROPRIATE
EVALUATION OF PATIENTS WITH HEMATURIA?
Routine urinalysis has questionable utility in asymp-
tomatic patients, and screening healthy asymptomatic
patients with the primary intent of cancer detection is
not currently recommended by any major health orga-
nization. When dipstick urinalysis is done and results
are positive for heme, practitioners should proceed to
microscopic confirmation of erythrocytes in the urine
before initiating referral. Although there may be local
variation in laboratories' designated “normal range,” a
threshold of at least 3 erythrocytes per HPF is consid-
ered abnormal across several recommendations (Table
1). If menstruation, viral illness, vigorous exercise, or
some other benign cause is suspected, the evaluation
should be repeated after the cause is excluded. If infec-
tion is suspected based on urinalysis or symptoms, a
urine culture should be obtained; if infection is con-
firmed, the evaluation should be repeated after treat-
ment to document resolution of hematuria. Because of
the potential intermittent nature of hematuria, some or-
ganizations specifically recommend up to 3 repeated
analyses in these scenarios (29). Given the potential
burden of this recommendation and the limited evi-
dence base supporting specific actions with respect to
this practice, providers may consider repeated micro-
scopic testing on the basis of the risk associated with
the clinical presentation. Practitioners should be aware
of risk factors for cancer (Table 2) when considering the
finding of hematuria because data suggest that timely
referral may be neglected, even in high-risk subgroups
(24).
Increased awareness of the substantially stronger
association of gross hematuria with cancer and other
potentially serious underlying conditions is a key edu-
cational message for patients and practitioners (7–9).
Although gross hematuria can be alarming, it is often
self-limited, which could provide a false sense of secu-
rity. This may explain, in part, why a substantial propor-
tion of respondents in 1 primary care survey reported
not referring patients with gross hematuria for urologic
evaluation (20). Furthermore, emerging evidence sug-
gests that a history of self-limited gross hematuria may
be a common, important, and significantly underre-
ported symptom. In a recent large prospective cohort
study of patients referred to urologic evaluation for
AMH, 19.8% reported visible hematuria in the preced-
ing 6 months when they were specifically queried
about this symptom (8). This was associated with an
odds ratio of 7.2 for the presence of urologic cancer.
The value of care in this setting may be substantially
improved by providers reducing the indiscriminate use
of urinalysis and specifically inquiring about a history of
visible (or even self-limited) hematuria as part of their
routine review of systems.
Increased awareness of current recommendations
and components of the evaluation of patients with he-
maturia could also improve care delivery (Figure 1). Or-
ganizations may consider development of point-of-care
educational tools, including decision-support interven-
tions embedded in electronic medical records.
LIMITATIONS OF THE EVIDENCE
Although the literature suggests that office-based
urinalysis is highly prevalent in primary care practice (5,
6, 20), these data are from survey studies and have at-
tendant limitations. The proportion of such tests that
are primarily intended to screen for hematuria is un-
known and may be small, given the multiplex nature of
the test. Clinical experience in urology supports the ob-
servation of a potentially large number of inappropriate
referrals for “dipstick pseudohematuria,” which could
subject many patients to a potentially avoidable cas-
cade of anxiety, harms of invasive and radiographic
testing, and costs (22); however, the findings of this
small study have yet to be replicated. Although some
clinical presentations of AMH (such as malignant
hypertension, renal insufficiency, cellular casts, protein-

 uria, or dysmorphic erythrocytes) logically suggest
diagnosis-directed management by a nephrologist as
the appropriate first and potentially only consult, a de-
tailed examination of current practice in that context
was beyond the scope of this article. Although surveys
and observational studies consistently show that a mi-
nority of patients with hematuria are referred, some
degree of triage is expected; however, few data are
available about the appropriateness of referral in
practice.
Despite the prevalence of hematuria in routine
practice and the economic and public health burden
associated with identifying persons with potentially se-
rious conditions, the quality of evidence to inform the
execution of high-value care in this context is limited.
The literature review for a formal health technology as-
sessment on this topic conducted by the U.K. National
Institute for Health Research identified 79 hematuria di-
agnostic algorithms, none of which had been formally
evaluated in terms of its effect on patient outcomes
(73). The more recent evidence review informing the
current AUA guideline reiterated this problem, with
none of the specific recommendations therein sup-
ported by evidence with a grade higher than C (29).
Differences among existing recommendations for the
urologic evaluation of patients with AMH reflect value
judgments in the context of substantial uncertainty in-
herent to the evidence base comprising observational
studies of heterogeneous design. The concept of
preference-sensitive guidelines (74) may be applicable
to this context, and some physicians have advocated
for the development of patient decision aids as a vehi-

 cle to promote shared decision making in the evalua-
tion of AMH (75).
Two salient areas of discordance among existing
AMH recommendations include the age threshold
above which adults should be referred for urologic
evaluation and the recommended method of upper uri-
nary tract imaging (Table 1). These concepts have im-
portant implications for the value of care in this setting,
framed by the heterogeneous pretest probabilities of
AMH as a marker of serious diagnoses and, in turn, the
question of whether a particular scheme of diagnostic
testing in a given context provides health benefits that
are worth the associated costs or harms (76). In partic-
ular, the nontrivial radiation exposure associated with
CT urography may carry the greatest potential carcino-
genesis risk in younger patients, among whom prior
probability of AMH as a signal of occult upper urinary
tract cancer is also the lowest (7, 8). Although the asso-
ciation between radiation exposure from CT imaging
and lifetime cancer risk has been only indirectly esti-
mated, the potential public health burden of harms of
low-yield testing warrants further scrutiny. Against this

SUMMARY OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS ADVICE FOR HIGH-VALUE CARE ON 
THE EVALUATION OF HEMATURIA AS A MARKER OF OCCULT URINARY TRACT CANCER
Disease/Condition
Hematuria
Internists, family physicians, and other clinicians
Adults with hematuria
Cancer detection
Reduction in mortality and morbidity associated with possible cancer
High-Value Care Advice 1: Clinicians should include gross hematuria in their routine review of systems
and specifically ask all patients with microscopic hematuria about any history of gross hematuria.
High-Value Care Advice 2: Clinicians should not use screening urinalysis for cancer detection in 
asymptomatic adults.
High-Value Care Advice 3: Clinicians should confirm heme-positive results of dipstick testing with 
microscopic urinalysis that demonstrates 3 or more erythrocytes/HPF before initiating further 
evaluation in all asymptomatic adults.
High-Value Care Advice 4: Clinicians should refer for further urologic evaluation in all adults with
gross hematuria, even if self-limited.
High-Value Care Advice 5: Clinicians should consider urology referral for cystoscopy and imaging
in adults with microscopically confirmed hematuria in the absence of some demonstrable benign cause.
High-Value Care Advice 6: Clinicians should pursue evaluation of hematuria even if the patient is
receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy.
High-Value Care Advice 7: Clinicians should not obtain urinary cytology or other urine-based molecular
markers for bladder cancer detection in the initial evaluation of hematuria.

 backdrop, some organizations have implemented risk-
stratification algorithms that dramatically reduce the
frequency of CT testing among the lower-risk sub-
groups of patients with hematuria (8).
CONCLUSION
Health care practices associated with high costs,
potentially avoidable harms, and limited or no benefits
provide little value (76). The differing algorithms of ex-
isting recommendations for the evaluation of AMH re-
flect both current uncertainty in this area of practice
and differences of opinion about the implicit tradeoffs
among the harms, costs, and benefits of a given ap-
proach. These tradeoffs include both the threshold for
initiating evaluation in a given case and the appropriate
components of evaluation in a given circumstance (Ta-
ble 1). Further research is needed to strengthen the
evidence base supporting a high-value approach to the
evaluation of the common finding of AMH.
HIGH-VALUE CARE ADVICE
High-Value Care Advice 1: Clinicians should in-
clude gross hematuria in their routine review of systems
and specifically ask all patients with microscopic hema-
turia about any history of gross hematuria.
High-Value Care Advice 2: Clinicians should not
use screening urinalysis for cancer detection in asymp-
tomatic adults.
High-Value Care Advice 3: Clinicians should con-
firm heme-positive results of dipstick testing with micro-
scopic urinalysis that demonstrates 3 or more erythro-
cytes per high-powered field before initiating further
evaluation in all asymptomatic adults.
High-Value Care Advice 4: Clinicians should refer
for further urologic evaluation in all adults with gross
hematuria, even if self-limited.
High-Value Care Advice 5: Clinicians should con-
sider urology referral for cystoscopy and imaging in
adults with microscopically confirmed hematuria in the
absence of some demonstrable benign cause.
High-Value Care Advice 6: Clinicians should pursue
evaluation of hematuria even if the patient is receiving
antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy.
High-Value Care Advice 7: Clinicians should not
obtain urinary cytology or other urine-based molecular
markers for bladder cancer detection in the initial eval-
uation of hematuria.
