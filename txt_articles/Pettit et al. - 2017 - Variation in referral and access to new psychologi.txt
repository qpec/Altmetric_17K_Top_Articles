 INTRODUCTION
In 2009, the Royal College of Psychiatrists 
suggested that the UK currently provides 
more mental health services for those 
<65 years of age than it does for older 
people.1 Barriers to mental health 
treatment are known to differ by age2 
and concerns that discrimination against 
older adults may lead to reduced access 
to mental health treatments, including 
talking therapies, are expressed.3 Data 
available from the Improving Access to 
Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme, 
which aimed to equitably improve access, 
allows exploration of the degree to which 
inequalities persist across different age 
groups.
The Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 
(APMS) provides data on the prevalence of 
psychiatric disorder (treated and untreated) 
in the English adult population. ‘Common 
mental health problems’ (CMHPs) is an 
umbrella term describing difficulties in low 
mood and anxiety, and is a descendant of 
the term ‘common mental disorders’. The 
APMS describes common mental disorders 
as conditions comprising different types 
of depression and anxiety.4 Data from the 
APMS suggest prevalence of depression 
reduces with age from middle age 
onwards,4 a finding supported by others5 
but not by Stordal and colleagues,6 who 
reported a linear increase of depression 
with increasing age after carefully adjusting 
for confounders for individuals in Norway. 
Whatever the truth about prevalence, it is 
clearly apparent that there is inequity of 
access. In the 1990s fewer than 3% of adults 
aged >65 years reported seeing a mental 
health professional.7 Using data from the 
APMS (2007), Cooper and colleagues8 found 
younger adults (16–34 years) to be 80% 
more likely than older adults (≥75 years) 
with the same severity of CMHPs to be 
receiving talking therapy. In contrast, older 
adults were more likely than younger adults 
to receive antidepressants or anxiolytics and 
hypnotics, suggesting that older adults are 
being prescribed medication rather than 
talking therapy and vice versa for younger 
adults here. 
Inequities in access to talking therapies 
across age may be dependent on patient 
attitudes, practitioner attitudes, and/or 
system factors. Depressive symptoms are 
common in older adults, but psychological 
adjustment to ageing and chronic illness 
may mean symptoms are not acknowledged 
or revealed.9 It may be assumed by some 
healthcare 
professionals 
that

Abstract
Background
Older people with common mental health 
problems (CMHPs) are known to have reduced 
rates of referral to psychological therapy. 
Aim
To assess referral rates to the Improving Access 
to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services, 
contact with a therapist, and clinical outcome 
by age.
Design and setting
Empirical research study using patient episodes 
of care from South West of England IAPT 
services.
Method
By analysing 82 513 episodes of care (2010–2011), 
referral rates and clinical improvement were 
compared with both total population and 
estimated prevalence in each age group using 
IAPT data. Probable recovery of those completing 
treatment was calculated for each group.
Results
Estimated prevalence of CMHPs peaks in 
45–49-year-olds (20.59% of population). The 
proportions of patients identified with CMHPs 
being referred peaks at 20–24 years (22.95%) and 
reduces with increase in age thereafter to 6.00% 
for 70–74-year-olds. Once referred, the proportion 
of those attending first treatment increases with 
age between 20 years (57.34%) and 64 years 
(76.97%). In addition, the percentage of those 
having a clinical improvement gradually increases 
from the age of 18 years (12.94%) to 69 years 
(20.74%).
Conclusion
Younger adults are more readily referred 
to IAPT services. However, as a proportion 
of those referred, probabilities of attending 
once, attending more than once, and clinical 
improvement increase with age. It is uncertain 
whether optimum levels of referral have 
been reached for young adults. It is important 
to establish whether changes to service 
configuration, treatment options, and GP 
behaviour can increase referrals for middle-
aged and older adults.

Variation in referral and access to new 
psychological therapy services by age: 
an empirical quantitative study
e453  British Journal of General Practice, July 2017
 adults experience psychological distress 
as a natural and inevitable consequence 
of ageing.9,10 Ross and Hardy11 found GP 
decisions were influenced by patients’ 
help-seeking behaviours as well as their 
representations of mental health problems. 
GPs may believe older adults are less 
responsive to cognitive behavioural therapy 
than younger adults.12,13 Patients’ belief that 
they can ‘manage themselves’ increases 
with age, making it less likely that they will 
disclose their mental health problems to 
a GP, less likely that they will be referred, 
and less likely that they will accept offered 
treatment.14,15 It is possible that older 
adults attribute their symptoms to physical 
complaints, whereas younger adults 
have greater awareness of psychological 
problems.10 Older adults’ inability to 
express their psychological problems, 
and their greater self-stigma, reduce the 
likelihood that they will seek help,10 or 
be offered appropriate help by healthcare 
professionals,11 creating further inequities 
in access to mental health treatment on the 
basis of age.
In 2008, the development of new 
psychological therapy services across 
England under the IAPT programme 
improved access to treatments for 
CMHPs,2 encompassing individuals with 
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and 
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as 
well as the more prevalent anxiety and 
depression. By 2011, 142 primary care 
trusts (PCTs) had an IAPT service and 
£400 million was being invested up to 2015. 
Targets for rates of access to psychological 
therapy included services providing enough 
therapists to meet the needs of the whole 
PCT population, with half of those who 
completed the programme moving to 
recovery.16 IAPT services include routine 
collection of session-by-session outcome 
data for all individuals referred. The IAPT 
data enable exploration of differences in 
access to mental health treatments across 
age, allowing comparisons of referrals, 
access to the services, and responses to 
treatment. 
Previous audits and monitoring suggest 
access to talking therapies is greater for 
younger individuals.8 This study aimed to 
accurately estimate differences in referral 
and access rates to the IAPT services and 
to compare the pathway through treatment 
across age bands, controlling for predicted 
prevalence of CMHPs.
METHOD
The overall design of the current study 
was to derive figures in each age band 
for total population, estimated prevalence 
and numbers referred, being seen, and 
patients who achieved the minimal clinical 
important difference (MCID) in symptoms; 
and then to calculate rates using different 
key denominators. The most recent APMS 
(2007)4 data were analysed with data 
collected from IAPT services in 13 primary 
care trusts (PCTs) from 2010–2011. The 
dataset was created for a service evaluation 
project of the IAPT services commissioned 
by the South West Strategic Health Authority 
in England.
Population and prevalence data were 
obtained from the APMS survey, which used 
a robust stratified, multi-stage probability 
sample of households, and which assessed 
and 
diagnosed 
psychiatric 
disorder 
according to diagnostic criteria where 
possible. Participants completed the revised 
Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS- R),17 
which measures symptoms linked to the 
diagnosis of anxiety and depression, and 
provides an overall score for the presence 
of CMHPs (indicated by a score of ≥12). The 
APMS series is the largest, most detailed, 
and most recent (2007) data (at the time of 
collection) available for comparison of IAPT 
services use. The APMS provided numbers 
on estimated prevalence of CMHPs across 
sex (which the authors of the current study 
combined), as well as total population, in 
each of the 13 PCTs individually. Using this 
data, the numbers of people in each age 
group in the South West and the numbers 
of people in each age group in the South 
West who were estimated to have CMHPs 
were totalled, and these were used as 
denominators to calculate rates and 
proportions. 
Numbers of people referred, obtaining 
access, and the associated clinical 
outcomes were derived from the South 
How this fits in
Older adults with common mental health 
problems are known to have reduced rates 
of referral to psychological therapy. This 
study assessed referral and access rates 
to the Improving Access to Psychological 
Therapies (IAPT) services, as well as 
clinical outcome, by age. The results show 
that older adults with common mental 
health problems are being under-referred 
but benefit more than younger individuals 
once they obtain access to the service. 
This outcome highlights an imbalance in 
referral rates across age, which should 
be addressed at the referral stage by 
healthcare practitioners.

 West IAPT evaluation database, which 
includes information from the IAPT service 
providers’ databases relating to 13 South 
West PCTs. Individuals aged 18–74 years of 
age were included in the study to reflect data 
taken from the APMS (which excludes those 
in care homes). The anonymised referral, 
access, and outcome data were generated 
from 82 513 individual episodes of care 
(76 734 patients). Patients’ demographic 
information (including age) and details 
of attendance and health outcomes were 
recorded at every clinical contact. The latter 
included the Patient Health Questionnaire 
(PHQ-9)18 as a measure of depression, and 
the Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7)19 
questionnaire as a measure of anxiety.
The authors of this study estimated the 
proportions of the total populations having 
CMHPs; being referred to IAPT; obtaining 
access by attending their first session with 
an IAPT therapist; engaging in treatment 
by attending at least one further session; 
and those achieving MCID in both the 
PHQ-9 and the GAD-7. The proportions 
were calculated of those estimated to have 
CMHPs being referred to IAPT; obtaining 
access by attending their first session with 
an IAPT therapist; engaging in treatment 
by attending at least one further session; 
and those achieving MCID. The proportions 
were then calculated of referred patients 
obtaining access; engaging in treatment 
by attending at least one further session; 
and those achieving MCID. MCID was also 
shown as a proportion of those with two or 
more treatment sessions.
To calculate the MCID patients must 
have attended two or more (valid) clinical 
contacts and improvement was measured 
by comparing final therapy session score 
with baseline session score on the following 
outcome measures. The MCID value for 
PHQ-9 is a reduction of ≥5 points between 
first and last session, and for GAD-7 it is 
a reduction of ≥4 points between first and 
last session.20 The proportion achieving the 
MCID in both PHQ-9 and GAD-7 by those 
with more than two therapy sessions in 
each age group was then calculated.
RESULTS
There were 82 513 treatment episodes 
recorded across the 13 IAPT services in 
the South West of England. The number 
of people in each age group in the study 
area is shown in Table 1 along with the 
estimated number of people with CMHPs 
and the numbers of people referred to IAPT 
services, attending at least one session with 
an IAPT practitioner; uptake of treatment by 
at least one further session; and achieving

 MCID. The numbers are also expressed 
as proportions of estimated prevalence, of 
referrals, and of those seen.
Estimated prevalence of CMHPs peaks 
in 45–49-year-olds (20.59%), with lowest 
estimated prevalence in 70–74-year-olds 
(9.47%). Referral rates as a proportion of 
CMHPs peak in 20–24-year-olds (22.95%) 
and then decrease from this point until 
74 years of age (6.00%). Attendance rates as 
a proportion of referrals peak in 60–64-year-
olds (76.97%) with lowest attendance rates 
in 20–24-year-olds (57.34%). Further detail 
can be found in Table 1.
The proportions of the population being 
referred, obtaining access, engaging with 
treatment, and achieving MCID each peak 
in 25–29-year-olds and decline thereafter, 
with lowest numbers for 70–74-year-olds. 
Figure 1 shows the contrast graphically. 
Figure 2 depicts a ‘vertically magnified’ 
version of Figure 1, showing the proportion 
of the population referred, obtaining access, 
continuing with treatment, and achieving 
MCID from the total population. 
Access uptake, continued treatment, and 
achieving MCID, represented as a proportion 
of referrals, is depicted in Figure 3. Of those 
referred: proportions of people obtaining 
access increases until 64 years (76.97%); 
proportions of people with ≥2 treatment 
sessions increases until 59 years (35.31%); 
and proportions of people achieving MCID 
increases from 18 years until 69 years 
(15.86%).
The age group with the lowest proportion 
achieving MCID or reliable improvement is 
70–74-year-olds (32.77%) but otherwise the 
percentage with MCID gradually increases 
from those aged 20–24 (37.08%) to those 
65–69 years (46.17%), this age group having 
the highest proportion achieving MCID 
(Figure 4).
In summary, more referrals are made 
for younger adults with a peak age of 
25–29 years as a proportion of the total 
population and a peak age of 20–24 years 
as a proportion of those with CMHPs, but, 
once referred, a higher proportion of older 
adults are engaging with and benefiting 
from treatment than are 20–29-year-olds.
DISCUSSION
Summary
Concerns about discrimination against older 
adults leading to reduced access to talking 
therapies have been widely shared.2,3 The 
current study has shown, taking estimated 
prevalence into account, that access is 
indeed lower for older and middle-aged 
adults compared with younger adults. The 
estimated prevalence of CMHPs peaks 
in 45–49-year-olds but the proportions of 
those being referred peaks in 20–24-year-
olds. This is an important finding as it is 
possible that, given lower uptake, retention, 
and improvement, there is over-referral of 
younger patients who either find it difficult 
to engage, or who are less likely to improve if 
they do engage, or who do not see the value 
of talking therapies at this point in their lives.
This study also showed that, once 
referred, older adults may benefit more

 from the IAPT services. Of those referred, 
the proportion of those obtaining access 
increases until 64 years, engaging with 
treatment increases until 59 years, and 
achieving MCID increases until 69 years. 
Once referred, adherence to and recovery 
resulting from treatment increases with 
age, and higher proportions of older adults 
are accessing and engaging with treatment 
than the 20–24-year-olds, who are being 
referred more frequently. 
Strengths and limitations
The data represent populations who have 
been referred to the IAPT services, and not 
those using other primary or secondary 
care services. It is important to note that 
the APMS only included those living in 
private households, and not those in care 
homes.21 Nonetheless, the APMS series is 
the most recent and detailed data available 
for comparison of IAPT services use.
The data described above are purely 
quantitative and although it is possible 
to speculate, it is difficult to explain why 
these differences in referral, engagement, 
and outcome exist between patients from 
different age groups. Other studies have 
indicated some of the potential reasons in 
relation to service configuration but have 
not focused on older adults.22
Comparison with existing literature
Patients can be signposted to the IAPT 
services by any appropriate referrer, and 
the main source of referrals is the GP. As 
such, GP decision making and practices 
regarding referral to psychological therapy 
services will have a large impact on access 
for patients. Cooper and colleagues8 found 
younger adults (16–34 years) more likely 
than older adults (≥75 years) with the same 
severity to have seen their GP regarding 
a mental health issue and to be receiving 
talking therapy treatment. A combination 
of factors may contribute to lower referral 
rates of older adults by healthcare 
professionals: 
• self-stigma towards mental health 
in older adults, leading to reduced 
disclosure and requests for help;11,14,15
• increased likelihood of older adults 
receiving prescribed medication(s);8
• attitudes of professionals;10
• multimorbidity in older adults leading 
to reduced recognition of mental health 
issues; and
• system factors that prevent access to 
those who are frail or homebound.
It seems likely that reasons for the 
reduced referral shown by this study are 
multifactorial. However, given that there 
are much higher contact rates between GPs 
and older adults than with younger adults, 
the reduced referral rates are even more 
striking. Although there are good grounds 
for believing that GPs may not be offering 
the opportunity of referral to older adults, it 
is also likely that these patients may believe 
they can ‘manage themselves’, making 
them less likely to disclose information to 
their GP, or accept suggested help.14,15

 to benefit from psychological therapy is 
a prominent feature included in a GP’s 
referral decision23 and the GP may also 
assume certain age groups will not engage 
with the service.
Implications for practice 
A number of factors are likely to affect access 
to IAPT services. Where possible, these 
need to be considered when evaluating 
the ability of new IAPT services to achieve 
their access targets. When considering age 
and specific age groups facing barriers 
to use of IAPT services, the main inequity 
seems to be at the referral stage. Although 
20–29-year-olds are being referred in the 
largest numbers, the proportion remaining 
engaged with treatment increases with age. 
Barriers to engagement with IAPT services 
in younger populations may be overcome by 
using different technologies, for example. 
Older adults are being under-referred but 
benefit significantly once obtaining access to 
the services. This suggests these inequities 
need to be acknowledged and addressed. 
Several barriers to treatment associated 
with age have been identified in recent work, 
including older patients’ own perceptions, 
attitudes, and behaviours towards mental 
health and associated talking treatments, 
and communication problems between the 
patient and doctor
. 
The current study should demonstrate to 
GPs that older patients are both more likely 
to attend and more likely to benefit once 
engaged in treatment. GPs should perhaps 
therefore work to discuss mental health 
problems with older adults and increase 
awareness of the different available 
therapies, and their potential benefits. 
IAPT services may also need to take note. 
Although those older adults who were 
referred attended more reliably, it is possible 
that the nature of services are more suited to 
young people and that this is a disincentive 
to referral. These considerations may also 
apply to those in middle age. It is harder 
to draw conclusions about younger people 
and it is not clear whether, in some high-
referring PCTs, higher numbers of young 
people are presenting with distress or 
access for younger people has achieved an 
optimum. It is also possible that, if therapy 
engagement can be improved in people 
in these younger age groups, they will be 
more likely to benefit from these types of 
treatments.
