Abstract: In this article, the American Cancer Society provides an overview of
female breast cancer statistics in the United States, including data on incidence,
mortality, survival, and screening. Approximately 252,710 new cases of invasive
breast cancer and 40,610 breast cancer deaths are expected to occur among US
women in 2017. From 2005 to 2014, overall breast cancer incidence rates increased
among Asian/Pacific Islander (1.7% per year), non-Hispanic black (NHB) (0.4% per
year), and Hispanic (0.3% per year) women but were stable in non-Hispanic white
(NHW) and American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) women. The increasing trends
were driven by increases in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, which
increased among all racial/ethnic groups, whereas rates of hormone receptor-
negative breast cancers decreased. From 1989 to 2015, breast cancer death rates
decreased by 39%, which translates to 322,600 averted breast cancer deaths in the
United States. During 2006 to 2015, death rates decreased in all racial/ethnic
groups, including AI/ANs. However, NHB women continued to have higher breast
cancer death rates than NHW women, with rates 39% higher (mortality rate ratio
[MRR], 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-1.43) in NHB women in 2015,
although the disparity has ceased to widen since 2011. By state, excess death rates
in black women ranged from 20% in Nevada (MRR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.42) to 66%
in Louisiana (MRR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.54, 1.79). Notably, breast cancer death rates
were not significantly different in NHB and NHW women in 7 states, perhaps reflect-
ing an elimination of disparities and/or a lack of statistical power. Improving access
to care for all populations could eliminate the racial disparity in breast cancer mor-
tality and accelerate the reduction in deaths from this malignancy nationwide. CA

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed among US women (excluding
skin cancers) and is the second leading cause of cancer death among women after
lung cancer. Every 2 years, the American Cancer Society describes the latest trends
in breast cancer incidence, mortality, survival, and screening by race/ethnicity in the
United States as well as state variations in these measures. Additional data are
available from the biennial publication of Breast Cancer Facts & Figures (available at
cancer.org/statistics).
Materials and Methods
Data Sources
Population-based cancer incidence data in the United States are collected by the
National Cancer Institutes (NCI’s) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER) program and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National
Program of Cancer Registries. Long-term incidence and survival trends since 1975
by age and race were based on data from the 9 oldest SEER registries, representing
9% of the US population.1 Beginning in 1992, data are available for Asians/Pacific
Islanders (APIs), American Indians/Alaska Natives (AIs/ANs), and by Hispanic

 ethnicity from the SEER 13 registries, representing 13% of
the US population, and were used in analyses of incidence
trends by race/ethnicity.2 Data from the entire SEER catch-
ment area (18 SEER registries), covering 28% of the US
population, were used in analyses of breast cancer survival in
the most recent time period (2007-2013).3 Combined
SEER and National Program of Cancer Registries data, as
provided by the North American Association of Central
Cancer Registries (NAACCR), were the source of data for
projected new breast cancer cases in 2017; incidence rates by
race/ethnicity, age, subtype, and state; and analyses of inci-
dence trends by race/ethnicity and hormone receptor (HR)
status during 2004 through 2014.4,5 NAACCR data include
all US states except Minnesota, New Mexico, Nevada
(2010-2014 analyses), and Kansas (2004-2014 analyses),
because these states failed to meet NAACCR high-quality
standards for 1 or more years during these periods. Mortal-
ity data were obtained from the SEER program’s SEER*-
Stat database, as provided by the National Center for
Health Statistics.6 Statistics for AIs/ANs are based on data
from Contract Health Service Delivery Area counties. Prev-
alence data on mammography by race/ethnicity and state
were obtained from the 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Sur-
veillance System, an ongoing system of surveys conducted
by the state health departments in cooperation with the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.7 Mammogra-
phy prevalence estimates do not distinguish between exami-
nations for screening and diagnosis.
Statistical Analyses
Estimates of the total number of invasive and in situ breast
cancer cases and breast cancer deaths for 2017 were pub-
lished previously.8 Case estimates by age at diagnosis were
calculated by applying the proportion of cases diagnosed in
each age group during 2010 through 2014 from the
NAACCR analytic file to the total number of estimated
cases of invasive and in situ breast cancer in 2017. Similarly,
we calculated the estimated number of breast cancer deaths
by age at death by applying the proportion of deaths that
occurred in each age group during 2011 through 2015 to
the total estimated breast cancer deaths in 2017.
The estimated number of female breast cancer deaths
averted because of the reduction in breast cancer death rates
was calculated by first estimating the number of cancer
deaths that would have occurred if the death rate had
remained at its 1989 level. The expected number of deaths
was estimated by applying the 5-year age-specific cancer
death rates in 1989 to the corresponding age-specific female
populations from 1990 through 2015. The total number of
breast cancer deaths averted was the sum of the difference
between the expected number and recorded cancer deaths in
each age group and calendar year.
By using an approach similar to that of Anderson et al,9 we
imputed missing data on estrogen receptor (ER) and proges-
terone receptor (PR) status, assuming that ER and PR status
were missing at random and were conditional on year of diag-
nosis, age, race/ethnicity, and ER/PR status. Specifically, 2-
step imputation was performed based on the joint distribution
of ER (positive, negative, and missing) and PR (positive, neg-
ative, and missing) status. In the first step, those cases with
missing ER or PR (not both) status were allocated to ER/PR
positive and negative groups according to the distribution of
known ER/PR status in each year, age, race/ethnicity, and
ER/PR group. In the second step, those cases with both ER
and PR status missing were allocated to HR-positive (either
ER-positive or PR-positive) and HR-negative (both ER-
negative and PR-negative) groups according to the updated
distribution of HR status obtained in step 1.
All incidence and death rates were age-standardized to the
2000 US standard population and expressed per 100,000 per-
sons, as calculated by the NCI’s SEER*Stat software (version
8.3.4).10 We examined incidence and mortality trends using
the Joinpoint regression program to calculate the average
annual percent change.11 All incidence trends were adjusted
for delays in reporting based on SEER delay factors to account
for the additional time required for the complete registration

Selected Findings
Estimated Cases and Deaths in 2017
Approximately 252,710 new cases of invasive breast cancer
and 63,410 cases of in situ breast carcinoma are expected to
be diagnosed among US women in 2017 (Table 1). In addi-
tion, 40,610 women are expected to die from this disease in
2017. Eighty-one percent of breast cancers are diagnosed
among women ages 50 years and older, and 89% of breast
cancer deaths occur in this age group. The median age at
diagnosis for women with breast cancer is 62 years; the
median age at diagnosis is younger for black women (59
years) than for white women (63 years). The median age at
breast cancer death is 68 years overall (70 years for white
women and 62 years for black women).13
Probability of Developing Invasive Female Breast
Cancer
A woman living in the United States has a 12.4%, or a 1 in
8, lifetime risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer (Table
2). Lifetime risk reflects an average woman’s risk over an
entire lifetime, taking into account the possibility that she
may die from another cause before she would have been
diagnosed with breast cancer, and does not apply only to
women who live to a very old age. Age-specific probabilities

 for developing cancer over a 10-year period are also pro-
vided in Table 2. For example, the risk for a 50-year-old,
cancer-free woman being diagnosed with breast cancer over
the next 10 years is 2.3%. Equivalently, 1 in 43 cancer-free
women who are 50 years old will be diagnosed with breast
cancer by the age of 60 years.
Cancer Occurrence in the Most Recent Time
Period
Incidence and mortality rates
Female breast cancer incidence and mortality rates vary sub-
stantially by race/ethnicity in the United States (Fig. 1).
Non-Hispanic white (NHW) and non-Hispanic black
(NHB) women have higher breast cancer incidence and
death rates than women of other race/ethnicities; API
women have the lowest incidence and death rates. Although
the overall breast cancer incidence rate during 2010 through
2014 was slightly (2%) lower in NHB women (125.5 per
100,000) than in NHW women (128.7 per 100,000), the
breast cancer death rate during 2011 through 2015 was 42%
higher in NHB women (29.5 per 100,000) than in NHW
women (20.8 per 100,000). Racial differences in breast can-
cer incidence rates vary by age (Fig. 2). Compared with
NHW women, NHB women have higher breast cancer
incidence rates before age 40 years but lower rates at ages 65
to 84 years. NHB women are more likely to die from breast
cancer at every age.
Figure 3 shows racial/ethnic variation in incidence rates
by breast cancer subtype. Gene expression profiling techni-
ques have allowed researchers to identify at least 5 different
molecular subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 [HER2] overexpression, basal, and
normal-like tumors), which are biologically variable in pre-
sentation, response to treatment, and outcomes and may be
associated with distinct etiology.14,15 These molecular sub-
types are approximated using routinely evaluated immuno-
histochemical markers, including the presence or absence of
HRs (ER or PR); (HR-positive/HR-negative) and expres-
sion of the HER2 (HER2-positive/HER2 negative) pro-
tein.16 The HR-positive/HER2 negative (luminal A) breast
cancers are the most common subtype in each racial/ethnic
group; however, rates range from 53 cases per 100,000 in
Hispanics to 82 cases per 100,000 in NHW. Lower overall
breast cancer incidence rates in AI/AN, Hispanic, and API
women are primarily driven by lower rates of the HR-posi-
tive/HER2-negative subtype. In contrast, incidence rates
for triple-negative breast cancers (HR-negative/HER2-neg-
ative), most of which are the basal subtype, are twice as high
in NHB women (24 per 100,000) compared with NHW
women (12 per 100,000), which is the racial/ethnic group
with the second highest rate. Importantly, studies suggest that
the distribution of breast cancer subtypes may also vary within
the broad racial/ethnic groups described here. For example,
although overall rates of HR-negative/HER2-positive breast
cancers in API women are similar to the rates in other groups,
an analysis of California women by Asian ethnic subgroup
reported that Korean, Filipina, Chinese, and Southeast Asian
women had a higher risk of HR-negative/HER2-positive

 breast cancers compared with NHW women, whereas Japa-
nese and American Indian women had lower risk for this sub-
type.17 Racial and ethnic differences in breast cancer subtypes
may reflect variation in the prevalence of breast cancer risk
factors, particularly reproductive factors, which are most
strongly associated with HR-positive breast cancers15,18 but
also appear to reflect ancestry-related genetic variations.19–21
Stage distribution and survival
Racial and ethnic variations in breast cancer stage at diagnosis
and 5-year cause specific survival are shown in Figure 4.
NHW and API women have the highest proportions of
localized breast cancers (range, 65%-67%) and the lowest
proportions of regional (range, 27%-30%) stage disease. In
contrast, NHB and Hispanic women have lower proportions
of localized breast cancers (range, 57%-59%) and higher pro-
portions of regional (35%) stage disease. Distant-stage disease
represented 9% of diagnoses among NHB women, compared
with 5% to 6% of diagnoses in other racial/ethnic groups.
Cause-specific survival (ie, the probability of not dying of
breast cancer within a specified number of years after diag-
nosis) is used instead of relative survival to describe survival
in racial and ethnic minorities, because reliable estimates of
life expectancy are not available for some racial/ethnic
groups. For each known stage of disease, 5-year breast can-
cer survival is highest for API women and lowest for NHB
women (Fig. 4). Racial/ethnic differences in survival in part
reflect the variation in the distribution of breast cancer sub-
types (Fig. 3).
Temporal Trends
Incidence
Much of the historic increase in breast cancer incidence
rates reflect changes in reproductive patterns, such as
delayed childbearing and having fewer children, which are
recognized risk factors for breast cancer.22,23 Incidence rates
of in situ and invasive breast cancer rose rapidly during the
1980s and 1990s (Fig. 5), largely because of increased use of
mammography screening in the United States. The wide-
spread uptake of mammography screening inflated the inci-
dence rate, because cancers were being diagnosed 1 to 3
years earlier than they would have been in the absence of
screening, and screening also may have led to the detection
of indolent cases. Invasive breast cancer rates stabilized
between 1987 and 1994, followed by a slower increase

 during the late 1990s. The continued increase particularly
among older women may reflect rising rates of obesity and
the use of menopausal hormones, both of which increase
the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, as well as further
increases in the prevalence of mammography screening.24
Around the year 2000, incidence rates began to decline
among women ages 50 years and older; and, between 2002
and 2003, breast cancer rates decreased nearly 7%, likely
because of the decreased use of menopausal hormones after
publication of the Women’s Health Initiative randomized
trial results linking the use of estrogen plus progesterone
menopausal hormone therapy to breast cancer and heart dis-
ease.25–27 The decline occurred primarily in white women
and in those who had HR-positive disease.26,28 The drop in
incidence may also reflect in part the small declines in mam-
mography screening since 2000. The percentage of women
aged 40 years and older who reported having a mammogram
within the past 2 years increased from 29% in 1987 to 70%
in 2000 and dropped to 64% in 2015.29
Trends in breast cancer incidence rates by race/ethnicity
are shown in Figure 6. During 2005 through 2014 (the
most recent 10 years of data available), overall breast cancer
incidence rates increased among API (1.7% per year),
NHB (0.4% per year), and Hispanic (0.3% per year)
women but were stable among NHW and AI/AN women.
Incidence rates for AI/AN women are less stable than for
other racial and ethnic groups, because high-quality data
for this group are only available from limited geographic
areas. We further examined breast cancer incidence trends
by HR status for the 5 major US racial/ethnic groups dur-
ing 2004 through 2014 (Fig. 7). In all racial/ethnic groups,
incidence rates increased for HR-positive (ER-positive or
PR-positive) breast cancers and decreased for HR-negative
tumors.
Mortality
Overall breast cancer death rates increased by 0.4% per year
from 1975 to 1989 but since have decreased rapidly, for a
total decline of 39% through 2015. As a result of this
decline, 322,600 breast cancer deaths have been averted in

 US women through 2015. The decrease occurred in both
younger and older women but has slowed among women
younger than 50 years since 2007. Declines in breast cancer
mortality rates have been attributed to both improvements
in treatment (eg, adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal
therapy in the 1980s and targeted therapies in the 1990s)
and early detection by mammography.30,31
Not all women have benefited equally from these
improvements, as evidenced by variation in mortality
trends by race/ethnicity (Fig. 8). A striking divergence
in long-term breast cancer mortality trends between
black and white women emerged in the early 1980s and
continued to widen over the last several decades, but
recent data suggest that the racial disparity may be stabi-
lizing. The mortality gap that developed more than 30
years ago may reflect the unmasking of differences in
tumor
phenotype
distribution
between
blacks
and
whites. Outcome improvements resulting from endocrine
therapy with tamoxifen (which was approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration in 1977) were being
realized during that timeframe but to a lesser degree
among black women because of their lower rates of HR-
positive disease. In 2011, the disparity peaked with death
rates 44% higher in NHBs than in NHWs (mortality
rate ratio [MRR], 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI],
1.40-1.48). The racial disparity has been relatively con-
stant over the past several years; in 2015, breast cancer
death rates were 39% higher in black women than in
white women (MRR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.35-1.43). In addi-
tion, the most recent data indicate that breast cancer
mortality rates have decreased in all major racial/ethnic
groups in the United States. From 2006 through 2015,
breast cancer death rates declined annually by 2.6% in
AI/ANs, 1.8% in NHWs, 1.5% in NHBs, 1.4% in His-
panics, and 0.9% in APIs. Notably, the decline among
AI/AN women began in 2005, more than a decade later
than other racial and ethnic groups.
Survival
More than 3.5 million US women with a history of breast
cancer were alive on January 1, 2016.32 Figure 9 present
trends in 5-year relative survival for breast cancer by race
and stage at diagnosis from 1975 through 1977 to 2007
through 2013. There were significant survival gains for each
stage of disease among both black women and white
women. The largest improvement in survival was for those
with regional-stage disease, which increased from 68% to
89% for white women and from 55% to 81% for black
women. Survival gains for distant-stage disease were larger
for white women (19% to 37%) than for black women (16%
to 26%). Improvements in breast cancer stage-specific sur-
vival reflect treatment advances as well as decreases in tumor
size within each stage of disease.33,34
Geographic variations in incidence, mortality, and
mammography
State variations in mammography screening prevalence,
breast cancer incidence and mortality rates and rate ratios,
and the proportion of in situ breast cancer diagnoses are
presented in Table 3. In 2014, the reported rates of mam-
mography within the past 2 years among white women ages
40 years and older ranged from 62% in Alaska to 83% in
Massachusetts. Thirty-six states had sample sizes large
enough to estimate the prevalence of recent mammography
screening among black women ages 40 years and older,
which ranged from 54% in Nevada to 89% in California.
Historically, breast cancer incidence rates were higher in
white women than in black women; however, incidence rates
converged for women living in the SEER 9 registry areas in
2012. Furthermore, among 43 states and the District of
Columbia with data on incidence rates for both blacks and
FIGURE 10. Mortality Rate Ratios Comparing Breast Cancer
Deaths Rates in Black Women Versus White Women by

white women were not statistically different (P < .05).

 whites, rates were significantly higher for black women living
in 8 mostly Southern states (Alabama, Indiana, Louisiana,
Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, and Vir-
ginia) and were not significantly different in 20 other states
(Table 3). In 15 states and the District of Columbia, inci-
dence rates remained lower in NHB women compared with
white women. When comparing incidence rates among
states, it is important to consider that incidence rates reflect
the intensity of screening as well as disease occurrence.
The percentage of in situ breast cancers, an indicator of
mammography utilization, varied from 15% in Wyoming
and Oklahoma to 24% in the District of Columbia and New
York among whites and from 11% in West Virginia to 26%
in Connecticut and Massachusetts among blacks.
In every US state, breast cancer death rates are higher in
NHB women than in NHW women. Breast cancer death
rates ranged from 17.5 to 24.5 per 100,000 in North Dakota
and Nevada, respectively, among white women and from
20.6 to 34.4 per 100,000 in Massachusetts and the District
of Columbia, respectively, among NHB women. The excess
death rate in blacks, as measured by the MRR, also varies
widely in the United States, ranging from 20% in Nevada
(MRR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.42) to 66% in Louisiana
(MRR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.54, 1.79) (Fig. 10). Notably, in 7
states, breast cancer death rates were not statistically differ-
ent between NHB and NHW women, although this may
reflect a lack of statistical power (small numbers of breast
cancer deaths among black women), except for Massachu-
setts (MRR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.94-1.24), Connecticut (MRR,
1.10; 95% CI, 0.94-1.28), and perhaps Delaware (MRR,
1.22; 95% CI, 1.00-1.49). Furthermore, Connecticut and
Massachusetts are the states with the lowest breast cancer
death rates and the highest proportions of in situ diagnoses
among NHB women.
Conclusion
A large body of research suggests that the black-white breast
cancer disparity results from a complex interaction of bio-
logic and nonbiologic factors, including differences in stage
at diagnosis, tumor characteristics, obesity, and comorbid-
ities as well as access, adherence, and response to treat-
ments.35 NHB women are disproportionately burdened
with triple-negative breast cancer, an aggressive subtype
associated with poorer survival.21,36 In addition, studies
have documented that racial disparities in survival are great-
est for women with HR-positive/luminal breast can-
cers.37–39 However, the substantial geographic variation in
breast cancer death rates and trends confirms the contribu-
tion of social and structural factors.40–43 An analysis of
breast cancer mortality trends by county identified 4 US
counties that achieved optimal and equitable breast cancer
outcomes for black women.42 Similar death rates among
NHB and NHW women in Massachusetts, Delaware, and
Connecticut likely reflect achievements in equitable access
to health care in these states.42–44 Increasing access to health
care in all states can further progress the elimination of
breast cancer disparities. �
