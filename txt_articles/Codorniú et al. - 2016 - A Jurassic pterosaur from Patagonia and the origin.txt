ABSTRACT
Pterosaurs are an extinct group of highly modified flying reptiles that thrived dur-
ing the Mesozoic. This group has unique and remarkable skeletal adaptations to pow-
ered flight, including pneumatic bones and an elongate digit IV supporting a wing-
membrane. Two major body plans have traditionally been recognized: the primitive,
primarily long-tailed paraphyletic ‘‘rhamphorhynchoids’’ (preferably currently rec-
ognized as non-pterodactyloids) and the derived short-tailed pterodactyloids. These
two groups differ considerably in their general anatomy and also exhibit a remarkably
different neuroanatomy and inferred head posture, which has been linked to different
lifestyles and behaviours and improved flying capabilities in these reptiles. Pterosaur
neuroanatomy, is known from just a few three-dimensionally preserved braincases of
non-pterodactyloids (as Rhamphorhynchidae) and pterodactyloids, between which
there is a large morphological gap. Here we report on a new Jurassic pterosaur from
Argentina, Allkaruen koi gen. et sp. nov., remains of which include a superbly pre-
served, uncrushed braincase that sheds light on the origins of the highly derived neu-
roanatomy of pterodactyloids and their close relatives. A µCT ray-generated virtual
endocast shows that the new pterosaur exhibits a mosaic of plesiomorphic and de-
rived traits of the inner ear and neuroanatomy that fills an important gap between
those of non-monofenestratan breviquartossans (Rhamphorhynchidae) and derived
pterodactyloids. These results suggest that, while modularity may play an important
role at one anatomical level, at a finer level the evolution of structures within a mod-
ule may follow a mosaic pattern.

INTRODUCTION
Pterosaurs first appeared in the Late Triassic and went on to achieve high levels of
morphologic and taxonomic diversity during the Mesozoic, with more than 150 species
recognized so far (Barrett et al., 2008; Butler, Benson & Barrett, 2013; Foth, Brusatte &

 Butler, 2012; Witton, 2013; Benson et al., 2014). They have traditionally been divided
into two major groups, ‘‘rhamphorhynchoids’’ (a paraphyletic assemblage of basal
pterosaurs) and pterodactyloids (Plieninger, 1901). ‘‘Rhamphorhynchoids’’ (Unwin, 2003)
now generally referred to as non-pterodactyloids (Bell & Padian, 1995), are characterized
by a long tail (except for some anurognathids) and short neck and metacarpus, whereas
pterodactyloids have a much larger body size range, an elongated neck and metacarpus,
and a relatively short tail. Furthermore, the endocranium of pterodactyloids (Edinger, 1941;
Klinghardt, 1941; Wellnhofer, 1970; Lewy, Milner & Patterson, 1992; Kellner, 1996; Lü et al.,
1997; Bennett, 2001; Witmer et al., 2003; Eck, Elgin & Frey, 2011) is strongly modified
compared to that of non-pterodactyloids (Newton, 1888; Edinger, 1927; Wellnhofer,
1975; Witmer et al., 2003; Gasparini, Fernández & De la Fuente, 2004). Thus, in contrast
to ‘‘rhamphorhynchoids’’ the cerebral hemispheres are enlarged, the pontine flexure is
pronounced, and the optic lobes are located beneath the cerebral hemispheres, mimicking
the neuroanatomy of birds in several respects. These modifications have important
implications for behaviour and sensory functions (Witmer et al., 2003).
Recently discovered taxa such as Darwinopterus from the early Late Jurassic of China
(Wang et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010; Lü et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2012; Sullivan et al., 2014)
appear to represent a transitionary stage that partially fills the morphological gap between
‘‘rhamphorhynchoids’’ and pterodactyloids (Lü et al., 2010; Andres, Clark & Xu, 2014).
Darwinopterus and its sister taxon, Pterodactyloidea, form a clade, Monofenestrata
diagnosed by the confluence of the narial and antorbital opening in a single fenestra (Lü
et al., 2010). Darwinopterus combines a ‘‘rhamphorhynchoid’’ body with a pterodactyloid
neck and skull, hinting at a modular type of evolution (Lü et al., 2010). Darwinopterus
and other basal monofenestratans (Wang et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010; Lü et al., 2010;
Liu et al., 2012; Sullivan et al., 2014) are, however, known only from compressed and
semi-compressed remains that yield limited braincase and endocranial information.
Here we describe a new pterosaur that is represented by several skeletal elements
including an almost perfect, three-dimensionally preserved braincase that shows a unique
combination of characters shared with both non-monofenestratan breviquartossans
(Rhamphorhynchidae sensu Witton, 2013) and pterodactyloids. Recovered by phylogenetic
analysis as the sister group of Monofenestrata, details of this pterosaur provide insights
into the origin of the pterodactyloid neurocranium and improve our understanding of the
tempo and mode of pterosaur evolution.
GEOLOGICAL SETTING
The type and referred material of the new taxon comes from a single locality within
the Cañadón Asfalto Formation in northern central Chubut Province, Argentina. The
Cañadón Asfalto Formation is a predominantly lacustrine unit mainly composed of shales,
lacustrine limestones and frequent conglomeratic and tuffacious intercalations (Stipanicic
et al., 1967; Tasch & Volkheimer, 1970; Cabaleri et al., 2010). The locality is placed in the
Canadón Carrizal, in a section of thin-bedded and strongly silicified lacustrine limestones,
probably representing a pan lake (Cabaleri, Armella & Silva Nieto, 2005). The pterosaur
Codorniú et al. (2016), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.2311

 bones were found in an extensive bonebed in the upper 5 cm of a limestone bed with a
thickness of 15–20 cm; the bonebed can be followed laterally for at least 30 m and might
be more extensive. The remains are usually disarticulated, though some association of
different elements is present, and one wing digit and two sets of mandibles were found
partially articulated (Codorniú, Rauhut & Pol, 2010). The holotype braincase MPEF-PV
3613 was found in close association with the cervical vertebra MPEF-PV 3616 and the
mandibles MPEF-PV 3609, and these remains probably represent a single individual. The
cervical vertebra MPEF-PV 3615 is identical to cervical MPEF-PV 3616 in all discernable
characters and is thus also referred to the same taxon. However, given the possibility that
more than a single taxon is present in the locality, the referral of all of this material should
be regarded as tentative. To establish the phylogenetic relationships of the new taxon we
analyzed a matrix in which we restricted information to the braincase alone, and then
conducted further analyses that included information from both the holotype and the
referred specimens (see below). That both analyses, with only the braincase and with the
addition of all known material, result in trees with the same topology further supports the
association of these materials.
The age of the Cañadón Asfalto Formation was, until recently, usually given as Callovian-
Oxfordian (latest Middle to earliest Late Jurassic), but new radiometric and biostratigraphic
evidence indicates that the formation is considerably older, with ages ranging from the
Toarcian (latest Early Jurassic; (Cúneo et al., 2013) to the earliest Bathonian (Volkheimer et
al., 2008; Cabaleri et al., 2010; Cúneo et al., 2013). For a more thorough discussion of the
age of the Cañadón Asfalto Formation, see Cúneo et al. (2013).
METHODS
CT-scan data
CT scans of the braincase (MPEF-PV 3613) were made by scanner v|tome|x s (GE Sensing
& Inspection Technologies GmbH phoenix|X-ray). The images (720 coronal stacks)
have a 1024 pixel resolution and a voxel size of 0.047310 × 0.047310 × 0.047310 mm.
Virtual three-dimensional reconstructions of the braincase, cranial endocast and inner ear
were generated using the software Materialise Mimics (10.0) at the University of Alberta
Paleovertebrate Laboratory; and the resulting 3D models were then imported into the
software Geomagic (10.0). Illustrations were made using Adobe Photoshop (C). The
terminology used for braincase pneumatic cavities follows Witmer (1997) and Dufeau
(2011).

Phylogenetic analysis
Taxon and character sampling
The data matrix used in the phylogenetic analysis is based on a revision of a previously
published phylogenetic analysis (Lü et al., 2010), with the addition of six new characters
derived from the skull region (most of which are focused on braincase anatomy) and one
character proposed by Andres & Ji (2008). Seven characters of the original dataset have
been modified (see SI., Character List) and three characters (25, 78, and 112) have been
excluded from this dataset given that they had vague character state definitions that did
not fit the analysed morphological diversity. The taxon sampling was also expanded from
the original dataset by including a recently described basal monofenestratan pterosaur
from China: Wukongopterus (Wang et al., 2009). Furthermore, the hypothetical ancestor
used by Lü et al. (2010) was replaced by codings for two outgroup representatives, the basal
archosauriform Euparkeria and the basal dinosaur Herrerasaurus. The resultant data matrix
includes 59 taxa scored across 123 characters. One of the multistate characters was treated
as ordered whereas the rest of the characters were treated as unordered (see SI., Character
List).
Two different phylogenetic analyses were conducted. First, the character codings for
Allkaruen koi were restricted to the anatomical information provided by the braincase
(MPEF-PV 3613) to test the phylogenetic information provided by this material. Second,
a more inclusive phylogenetic analysis was conducted scoring all the known materials
(MPEF-PV 3609, mandible; MPEF-PV 3615, 1616; cervical vertebrae) to determine the
phylogenetic position of the new taxon.
Phylogenetic analyses and results
The analyses were conducted under equally weighted parsimony in TNT (Goloboff, Farris
& Nixon, 2008) through a heuristic search of 1,000 replicates of Wagner trees followed by
TBR branch swapping.
The analysis of the dataset with the character scorings of only the braincase of Allkaruen
koi resulted in 360 most parsimonious trees (using the collapsing rule 3 for zero-length
branches; see Coddington & Scharff, 1994). These trees have 413 steps (CI = 0.419, RI
= 0.791). In all most parsimonious trees Allkaruen is located as the sister taxon to
Monofenestrata, a clade consisting of Pterodactyloidea, Darwinopterus, and Wukongopterus.
Analysis of the dataset with character scorings for all the known materials of Allkaruen
koi resulted in the same 360 most parsimonious trees (using the collapsing rule 3 for
zero-length branches; see Coddington & Scharff, 1994). These trees have 416 steps (CI =
0.416, RI = 0.789). The same phylogenetic position was retrieved for Allkaruen, as the
sister taxon of Monofenestrata [Pterodactyloidea + (Darwinopterus + Wukengopterus)].
The following discussion of consensus trees, support measures, and synapomorphy lists
are based on the dataset with the most inclusive scoring of Allkaruen koi (support values

Diagnosis. Small pterosaur diagnosed by the following unique combination of skull
characters present in the holotype (autapomorphies marked with asterisk): frontal with
large pneumatic foramen on the postorbital process; dorsal occiput faces posterodorsally
and occipital condyle faces posteroventrally; long, rod-like basipterygoid processes
diverging at approximately 20–25 degrees. The referred mandibular and vertebral materials
also show a unique combination of characters that include a long lower jaw with a concave
profile in lateral view; four-five large, septated, and well-separated anterior alveoli followed
by a posterior alveolar groove*; mid-cervical vertebrae elongate with low neural arch
and blade-like neural spine; pneumatic foramina on lateral surface of the centrum and
peduncle of the neural arch; reduced diapophyseal process lacking articular surface; absence
of accessory zygapophyseal processes.
Description
The braincase is undistorted and superbly preserved. All skull bones are fused, as in
most osteologically mature pterosaurs. In the skull roof, frontals and parietals are
completely fused with each other and the rest of the braincase. The parietals are long
(60% of the frontal length, excluding the nasal processes), as seen in Scaphognathus
(Geol. Paläont. Inst. Univ. Bonn, Nr. 1304) and Campylognathoides (Padian, 2008: Plate
5, Fig. 1), but unlike the relatively shorter parietal observed in other pterosaurs, such
as Rhamphorhynchus (Wellnhofer, 1975), Cacibupteryx (Gasparini, Fernández & De la
Fuente, 2004), Parapsicephalus (Newton, 1888), Pteranodon (Bennett, 2001) and Anhanguera
(Kellner & Tomida, 2000). The supratemporal fossae are deeply excavated on the parietals,
separated by a low and narrow sagittal crest (Fig. 1). In dorsal view, this crest is bifurcated at

the occipital margin of the skull roof, leading to a V-shaped nuchal crest. The dorsal surface
of the frontals is broad and flat. It is 22.5 mm in total length (13 mm long excluding the
nasal process). The nasal processes are slightly separated by a narrow gap which originally
accommodated the caudal extension of the premaxillae. That the latter are absent suggests
that the premaxillae and frontals had not yet fused. The postorbital process of the frontal
projects strongly laterally. The dorsal surface of the frontals curves abruptly ventrally
towards the posterior end of the postorbital processes to form the anterior margin of the
supratemporal fossa. Each frontal has a large oval foramen on the posterior surface of the
postorbital process (Figs. 1B and 4), within the margin of the supratemporal fossa, which
communicates internally with a large and complex pneumatic cavity that pneumatizes
almost the entire frontal, as shown by the CT scans.
The occiput is trapezoidal in shape, slightly concave transversely, and faces posteriorly,
resembling the morphology of Cacibupteryx (Gasparini, Fernández & De la Fuente, 2004)
and Rhamphorhynchus (Wellnhofer, 1978) (Fig. 1C). The occipital region in pterodactyloids
(e.g., Anhanguera, Pteranodon, Tapejara) is posteroventrally deflected with respect to
the longitudinal axis of the skull and is oval in outline, with rounded lateral margins
(Wellnhofer, 1985; Wellnhofer & Kellner, 1991; Bennett, 2001). The supraoccipital makes

up more than half the height of the occipital plane (14.5 mm of a total height of 24 mm)
above the foramen magnum. It is mostly flat lacking a backward extension, and becomes
gradually concave dorsally. Just dorsal and lateral to the foramen magnum there is a large,
high oval to kidney-shaped opening corresponding to the caudal middle cerebral vein
foramen. Ventrolateral to this foramen, there is a second, smaller opening corresponding
to the postemporal fenestra, which is enclosed between the supraoccipital and parietal.

In Allkaruen the postemporal fenestra is slightly smaller to subequal in size to the caudal
middle cerebral vein foramen, as in Rhamphorhynchus (Wellnhofer, 1975). This contrasts
with the condition of pterodactyloid pterosaurs, such as Anhanguera piscator (Kellner &
Tomida, 2000), Anhanguera santanae (Wellnhofer, 1985), Tapejara wellnhoferi (Wellnhofer
& Kellner, 1991; Kellner, 1996), and Pteranodon (Bennett, 2001), in which the postemporal
fenestra is almost twice the size of the exit of the dorsal head vein.
The occipital condyle is posteroventrally directed with respect to the longitudinal axis
of the skull, and thus also angled in respect to the plane of the dorsal part of the occiput.
This is comparable to the condition in monofenestratans including basal forms such as
Darwinopterus (D Unwin, 2016, unpublished data), but differs from the construction in
basal pterosaurs, for example Rhamphorhynchus (Witmer et al., 2003) where the occipital
condyle is parallel to the long axis of the skull. The occipital condyle is much smaller
than the foramen magnum, as in Rhamphorhynchus, Cacibupteryx, Rhamphinion, and
Tapejara, but unlike Pteranodon and Anhanguera in which the occipital condyle is larger.
The foramen magnum in Allkaruen is large, oval in shape and higher (7 mm) than wide
(5.5 mm). Laterally the exoccipital contacts the opisthotic, but the suture is obliterated,
as in all post-hatchling archosaurs. The opisthotic extends laterally from the exoccipital
to form the paroccipital process and the ventral margin of the postemporal fenestra. The
paroccipital processes are dorsoventrally high, but short transversely. The ventrolateral
border is much more steeply inclined and forms a notably ventrolaterally convex margin,
which ventrally turns into the crista tuberalis.

Two foramina are present anteroventrally on either side of the occipital condyle. The
small one piercing the exoccipital corresponds to a single opening for the passage of the
cranial nerve XII. The larger opening corresponds to the metotic foramen for the joint
exit of cranial nerves IX–XI, as in other pterosaurs (Wellnhofer, 1985; Bennett, 2001; Dalla

opening from the metotic foramen, both foramina open within a shallow common oval
recess, the paracondylar recess.

prootic and the opisthotic, as is usual in reptiles) is visible as a large, drop-shaped opening

Figure 7 Phylogenetic position of Allkaruen koi calibrated against geological time. The topology is based on the strict consensus and summa-
rizes the relationships among basal pterosaurs (‘‘rhamphorhynchoids’’) and major groups of Pterodactyloidea (collapsed into clades). Grey bar rep-

separated dorsally from the anterior opening of the postemporal fenestra by the paroccipital
process. The columellar recess is subdivided into a larger, anteromedially directed foramen
and a smaller posterodorsally directed foramen. Whereas the former represents the foramen
ovalis, the latter corresponds to a pneumatic foramen that communicates internally with a
pneumatic cavity within the base of the paroccipital process (Fig. 1A, Fig. S1). In terms of
its location this foramen appears to correspond to the pneumatic foramen of the posterior
tympanic recess found in derived theropod dinosaurs (Witmer, 1997) and the allosauroid
theropod Sinraptor dongi (Paulina-Carabajal & Currie, 2012). Although it is not possible
to determine if the foramen for the cranial nerve V is completely enclosed by the prootic,
this element forms at least the posterior margin of the opening.
The laterosphenoid is fused with the prootic posteriorly and with the frontal
dorsally, following the postorbital process of the frontal. The postorbital process of
the laterosphenoid is a narrow triangular projection adjacent to the posteroventral side of
the postorbital process of the frontal. A narrow ventral projection of the laterosphenoid
Codorniú et al. (2016), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.2311

 probably reaches the anteriormost part of the basisphenoid, forming the anterior margin
of the foramen for the cranial nerve V.
The trigeminal foramen is large and ovoid, with a maximum diameter of 4 mm, and faces
anterolaterally. There is no evidence of a separated foramen for the ophthalmic branch of
the trigeminal nerve in the specimen, unlike the situation observed in Anhanguera (Witmer
et al., 2003).
The orbitosphenoid and ethmoidal elements are missing; thus, the location and shape
of cranial nerves I–IV remains unknown in Allkaruen. The symmetry of the anterior walls
of the braincase enclosing the anterior section of the brain—frontal, laterosphenoids, and
basisphenoid—suggests that the orbitosphenoid and ethmoid remained cartilaginous in
this individual.
The elements of the basicranium, the basioccipital and basisphenoid, are firmly fused.
The basioccipital forms the ventral portion of the occipital condyle and apparently the basal
tubera. The occipital condyle is set off from the basioccipital body by a slightly constricted
neck (Fig. S1). The lower part of the basioccipital, between the occipital condyle and
the basal tubera, is strongly anteroventrally inclined, so that its ‘posterior’ surface faces
rather ventrally and is set at an angle of approximately 100◦ with respect to the plane of
exposure of the dorsal region of the occiput. Anteroventrally, the basioccipital strongly
expands transversely towards the basal tubera, from a minimal width of 6.5 mm between
the metotic foramina to approximately 12.5 mm across the basal tubera. The latter are
anteroposteriorly elongated, but transversely narrow structures at the lateral extremes of
the basioccipital expansion.
The ventral surface of the basisphenoid body is rhomboid in outline, with a tapering
anterior end. Anteriorly, long and narrow basipterygoid processes extend for 11 mm
anteroventrally from the basisphenoid body, from which they are offset dorsally by
a distinct step. The processes are long and slender and diverge anteroventrally at an
angle of approximately 35 degrees or slightly less (Fig. 1C). This contrasts with the
morphology of most non-pterodactyloid pterosaurs, in which the processes are highly
divergent (approximately 60◦–70◦), as in Dorygnathus (Padian, 2008), Carniadactylus
(Dalla Vecchia, 2009), Scaphognathus (Wellnhofer, 1978), and Cacibupteryx (Gasparini,
Fernández & De la Fuente, 2004), but is similar to the angle observed in Rhamphorhynchus
(Wellnhofer, 1975). However, in Allkaruen the basipterygoid processes are separated over
their entire length, and not connected by a bony web or plate, as seems to be the case in
most, possibly all, pterodactyloids including the ornithocheiroids Pteranodon (Bennett,
2001), Anhanguera (Kellner & Tomida, 2000) and Hongshanopterus (Wang et al., 2008), the
ctenochasmatines Gnathosaurus (Wellnhofer, 1970) and Pterodaustro (Codorniú, Paulina-
Carabajal & Gianechini, 2015), the dsungaripteroid, Dsungaripterus (D Unwin, 2016,
unpublished data), and the azhdarchoids Caupedactylus (Kellner, 2013) and Tupuxuara (D
Unwin, 2016, unpublished data).
Two large pneumatic openings are present on the lateral side of the basisphenoid. The
larger, more posteriorly placed opening is sited just posterior to the margin of the trigeminal
foramen and corresponds to the anterior tympanic recess seen in many theropod dinosaurs
(Witmer, 1997). A smaller, more anteriorly placed recess is separated from the anterior
Codorniú et al. (2016), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.2311
13/22
 tympanic recess by a thin bony septum. This recess seems to be associated with the entrance
of the carotid artery to the pituitary fossa and might be regarded as a basipterygoid recess.
The pituitary fossa is developed as a large, anterodorsally opening depression on the dorsal
side of the base of the basipterygoid processes.
The general morphology of the virtual cranial endocast is comparable to that described
for the few other pterosaurs where it is preserved and can be studied. The endocast is
bulbous, with short olfactory tract and bulbs, cerebral hemispheres with large and ventrally
displaced optic lobes, and an extremely enlarged flocculus (Fig. 2). The left inner ear
exhibits an anterior semicircular canal (ASC) that is considerably larger than the other two
canals (Fig. 3). The dorsal region of the ASC is located ventral to the dorsal surface of the
forebrain and approximately level with the olfactory tract.
Pneumatic cavities are present in the frontals, the ventral section of the exoccipital-
opisthotic complex (Fig. 4), and in the form of the anterior and posterior tympanic
recesses and basipterygoid recess described above. The cavities within the frontals are large
and contrast with the camellate pneumatisation of some derived pterodactyloids (Kellner,
1996). The cavities that invade the basicranium are also large, equivalent to those observed
in pterodactyloids such as Pterodaustro (Codorniú, Paulina-Carabajal & Gianechini, 2015).
As noted above, the placement of the external foramina for these last recesses within the
columellar recess indicate a tympanic origin for this pneumaticity. In turn, the pneumatic
cavities that invade the exoccipital-opisthotic are smaller and affect internally the base of
the paroccipital process and the neck of the occipital condyle on both sides of the braincase
(Fig. 4).
The mandible is long (approximately 3.5 times the length of the preserved region of the
skull), laterally compressed, and has concave alveolar and ventral margins in lateral view,
so that the dentary is curved anterodorsally. Each dentary bears several separate anterior
alveoli that occupy less than half of the preserved tooth row and a long and narrow alveolar
groove posteriorly (Figs. 1D, 1E and Fig. S2), a morphology that is unique to Allkaruen.
Although the symphysial region of the jaws has been lost due to recent erosion, the position
of the two rami in the matrix indicate that the dentary symphysis was rather short.
The cervical centrum is approximately three times as long as wide, broader
anteriorly than posteriorly, and lacks pre- and postexapophyses and hypapophysis. The
prezygapophyses and postzygapophyses are connected by a thin lamina that is ventrally
deflected along its anterior third, forming a short and triangular diapophyseal process that
lacks an articular surface. Two pairs of pneumatic foramina pierce the vertebrae, one on
the lateral surface of the centrum and the other on the ventral surface of the neural arch
(Figs. 1F, 1G and S3). Both foramina are found at approximately the mid-length of the
vertebra.
DISCUSSION
Phylogeny
Phylogenetic analysis positions Allkaruen as the sister taxon of Monofenestrata, a clade that
includes Wukongopteridae (Darwinopterus (Lü et al., 2010) and Wukongopterus (Wang et
Codorniú et al. (2016), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.2311
14/22
 al., 2009) from the Middle-Late Jurassic of China) and more derived pterosaurs (Fig. 5).
This location is supported by a mosaic of plesiomorphic and apomorphic character states
to be found in Allkaruen (see SI).
There are two characters: the orientation of the occiput (#33); and the degree of
separation of the basipterygoid processes (#37) where Allkaruen exhibits the plesiomorphic
condition, while the derived condition is present in all mononfenstratans for which these
characters can be scored. Allkaruen also exhibits the plesiomorphic condition for the length
of the mandibular symphysis (#47) and development of postexapophyses (#71) although
the plesiomorphic state is also found in at least one, or more, monofenstratans. There are
four characters: angle of divergence of the basipterygoid processes (#34); elongation of
the cervical centra (#73); height of the neural arch (#75); and height of the neural spines
(#76) where all basal pterosaurs exhibit the plesiomorphic state, while Allkaruen shares
the derived condition with monofenestratans, although for each of these characters the
plesiomorphic condition is present in at least one monofenestratan (see SI). There are a
further six characters (#12, #32, #36, #53, #61, #62) for which Allkaruen exhibits a derived
state, that is found in monofenestratans and at least one, or more (relatively derived), basal
pterosaurs.
Allkaruen and the evolution of the pterosaur neurocranium
The intermediate phylogenetic position of Allkaruen and the exceptional three-dimensional
preservation of the braincase provide new insights into the transformation of the
neurocranium, typical of basal pterosaurs, into the highly derived condition present
in pterodactyloids (Witmer et al., 2003) (Figs. 6C–6H). Descriptions of the neurocranial
anatomy of pterosaurs have so far been limited to two basal forms (Newton, 1888; Edinger,
1927; Wellnhofer, 1975; Witmer et al., 2003) and a few pterodactyloids (Edinger, 1927;
Edinger, 1941; Kellner, 1996; Lü et al., 1997; Bennett, 2001; Witmer et al., 2003; Eck, Elgin &
Frey, 2011). Detailed accounts of endocranial morphology (brain and inner ear) have
been published for only two pterosaurs, the non-monofenestratan breviquartossan
Rhamphorhynchus and the derived pterodactyloid Anhanguera (Witmer et al., 2003).
Comparisons with the virtual endocasts of Rhamphorhynchus and Anhanguera (Fig. 6),
show that Allkaruen shares plesiomorphies and apomorphies with one, or the other, of these
two taxa and alsoexhibits featureswith amorphologythat canbeinterpreted asintermediate
between that of Rhamphorhynchus and Anhanguera. A seemingly plesiomorphic feature of
the brain and inner ear of Allkaruen is the subhorizontal orientation of the frontal when the
long axis of the LSC is oriented horizontally (Fig. 6B). This is comparable to the condition
in Rhamphorhynchus (Witmer et al., 2003), but contrasts with the ventrally deflected frontal
of Anhanguera (Witmer et al., 2003). Note that, here, we use the orientation of the LSC
purely as a descriptive term, and do not infer any particular orientation of the head in the
taxa under consideration (Marugán-Lobón, Chiappe & Farke, 2013).
Four features of the braincase and endocranium of Allkaruen show an intermediate
condition between non-monofenestratan breviquartossans and pterodactyloids.
(I) The dorsalmost point of the ASC is located approximately at the same level as the
dorsal margin of the forebrain in Rhamphorhynchus (Witmer et al., 2003) (Fig. 6F) and
Codorniú et al. (2016), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.2311
15/22
 Parapsicephalus (Newton, 1888). By contrast, it is located at the midheight of the forebrain
in Allkaruen (Fig. 6G), and ventral to the olfactory tracts in several pterodactyloids including
Pteranodon, Tapejara, and Anhanguera (Witmer et al., 2003) (Fig. 6H).
(II) The orientation of the occiput and occipital condyle is intermediate between that
of non-monofenestratan breviquartossans, in which the occiput is mainly vertical, with
a posteriorly oriented occipital condyle, and pterodactyloids, in which the occiput faces
posteroventrally, or even ventrally. In Allkaruen the dorsal section of the occiput faces
posterodorsally, whereas the occipital condyle is inclined posteroventrally an intermediate
condition also found in Darwinopterus (D Unwin, 2016, unpublished data).
(III) In dorsal view, the lateral margin of the flocculus in Rhamphorhynchus does not
extend as far laterally as the lateral margin of the cerebral hemisphere, whereas these two
are about level in Allkaruen. By contrast, in Anhanguera the flocculus extends well beyond
the lateral margin of the cerebral hemisphere.
(IV) The ratio between the complete length of the brain and the height of the hindbrain,
when seen in lateral view, is 0.44 in Rhamphorhynchus and 0.69 in Anhanguera, whereas
this ratio is 0.6 in Allkaruen.
While the endocast morphology of Allkaruen seems, in many respects, to be intermediate
between that of basal pterosaurs and pterodactyloids, it also demonstrates an important
derived feature that is shared with monofenestratans. In basal taxa such as Parapsicephalus
(Newton, 1888) and Rhamphorhynchus (Witmer et al., 2003) the optic lobes lie at the same
level as the forebrain (Fig. 6F). Allkaruen, Darwinopterus (D Unwin, 2016, unpublished
data) and pterodactyloids (Edinger, 1941; Bennett, 2001; Witmer et al., 2003; Eck, Elgin
& Frey, 2011) show a derived state, pronounced flexure of the brain that displaces the
optic lobes ventrally (Figs. 6G and 6H), a condition convergently present in birds (Walsh
& Milner, 2011). This arrangement represents a major reorganization of neurocranial
architecture and while its significance has yet to be established, it seems to be an important
innovation in pterosaur evolution.
Finally, Allkaruen exhibits a neuroanatomical feature that is more derived than in
other pterosaurs. The ASC is slightly larger than the other two semicircular canals in
Rhamphorhynchus (25%) and Anhanguera (30%), but much larger (40–50%) in Allkaruen.
Pterosaur evolution
The discovery of strongly correlated character state distributions in Darwinopterus led Lü
et al. (2010) to suggest that major anatomical regions might have behaved as integrated
modules that changed at different times and rates during pterosaur evolution. However,
Allkaruen demonstrates that, whereas modular evolution might have operated at an
inclusive morphological level (e.g., skull + neck versus the remainder of the postcranium),
evolution within at least one of these modules (the neurocranium and braincase) seems to
have followed a mosaic pattern.
The late Early-early Middle Jurassic age of Allkaruen (Cúneo et al., 2013) also provides
new information on the timing of transformations during the evolution of the derived
pterodactyloid skull from that of basal pterosaurs. The derived features of the cranium of
Allkaruen indicate that some typical ‘‘pterodactyloid’’ skull features had already evolved by
Codorniú et al. (2016), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.2311
16/22
 the time of the Early/Middle Jurassic boundary (Fig. 7), before the origin of pterodactyloids
and the appearance of their modified postcranial skeleton. Prior to this discovery, a
large suite of cranial features was presumed to have appeared somewhat later, during
the late Middle to Late Jurassic, the age of the basal monofenestratans, Darwinopterus
(Lü et al., 2010) and Wukongopterus (Wang et al., 2009) and the oldest pterodactyloids
(Andres, Clark & Xu, 2014).
Unfortunately, the Early-Middle Jurassic is a period with a very poor pterosaur fossil
record, in contrast to the relatively diverse assemblage of pterosaurs known from both
the Late Triassic and the Late Jurassic–Cretaceous (Barrett et al., 2008; Butler, Benson &
Barrett, 2013; Benson et al., 2014). The early evolutionary origin and diversification inferred
for derived pterosaurs (Fig. 4), adds further evidence in support of the hypothesis that
the origin and diversification of major vertebrate lineages (e.g., dinosaurs (Allain & Läng,
2009; Pol & Rauhut, 2012), crocodyliforms (Pol & Gasparini, 2009), turtles (Sterli, Pol &
Laurin, 2013), mammals (Luo et al., 2011)) occurred prior to the Early/Middle Jurassic
boundary (Allain & Läng, 2009; Cúneo et al., 2013). This pattern was previously obscured
by the worldwide poor fossil record of terrestrial vertebrates during this evolutionarily
critical period of time.
