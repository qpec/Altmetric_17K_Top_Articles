Age-related degenerations in brain structure are associated with balance disturbances
and cognitive impairment. However, neuroplasticity is known to be preserved throughout
lifespan and physical training studies with seniors could reveal volume increases in the
hippocampus (HC), a region crucial for memory consolidation, learning and navigation
in space, which were related to improvements in aerobic fitness. Moreover, a positive
correlation between left HC volume and balance performance was observed. Dancing
seems a promising intervention for both improving balance and brain structure in the
elderly. It combines aerobic fitness, sensorimotor skills and cognitive demands while
at the same time the risk of injuries is low. Hence, the present investigation compared
the effects of an 18-month dancing intervention and traditional health fitness training on
volumes of hippocampal subfields and balance abilities. Before and after intervention,
balance was evaluated using the Sensory Organization Test and HC volumes were
derived from magnetic resonance images (3T, MP-RAGE). Fourteen members of the
dance (67.21 ± 3.78 years, seven females), and 12 members of the fitness group
(68.67 ± 2.57 years, five females) completed the whole study. Both groups revealed
hippocampal volume increases mainly in the left HC (CA1, CA2, subiculum). The dancers
showed additional increases in the left dentate gyrus and the right subiculum. Moreover,
only the dancers achieved a significant increase in the balance composite score. Hence,
dancing constitutes a promising candidate in counteracting the age-related decline in
physical and mental abilities.

INTRODUCTION
The human hippocampus (HC) is affected not only by pathological aging such as in Alzheimer’
s
disease but also by the normal aging process resulting in deficits in memory, learning, and spatial
navigation at old age (Driscoll et al., 2003; Barnes et al., 2009). Magnetic resonance-studies indicate
an atrophy rate of the hippocampus and the nearby parahippocampal gyrus of 2–
3% per decade
(Raz et al., 2004, 2005), which is further accelerated in the very old age where there is an annual loss

of 1% over the age of 70 (Jack et al., 1998). On the other
hand more recent research has shown that the HC counts
among the few brain regions with the ability to generate new
neurons throughout the lifespan (Kempermann et al., 2010;
Spalding et al., 2013). In animal models physical activity has
been identified as a key mechanism that can drive this adult
neuroplasticity (van Praag et al., 1999; Kronenberg, 2003).
In humans, research has focused on the effects of aerobic
fitness and training on volumes and perfusion of the HC.
Results reveal that higher cardiorespiratory fitness levels (VO2
max) are associated with larger hippocampal volumes in late
adulthood, and that larger hippocampal volumes may, in
turn, contribute to better memory function (Erickson et al.,
2011; Szabo et al., 2011; Bugg et al., 2012; Maass et al.,
2015). Furthermore, some investigations also assessed possible
physiological mediators of the observed neuroplasticity, such as
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth
factor 1 (IGF-1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
(Flöel et al., 2010; Erickson et al., 2011; Ruscheweyh et al.,
2011; Maass et al., 2016). Whereas Erickson et al. (2011)
reported a positive correlation between levels of serum BDNF,
hippocampal volume and cardiorespiratory fitness during 1 year
of aerobic training, neither Ruscheweyh et al. (2011) nor Maass
et al. (2016) found fitness-related BDNF changes after 6 or
3 months of training, respectively. Moreover, other studies
failed to find correlations between volumes of the medial
temporal lobe area or the hippocampus and cardiovascular
fitness in healthy elderly (Honea et al., 2009; Smith et al.,
2011). Therefore, the role of cardio-respiratory fitness in
modulating hippocampal gray matter volume is still under
debate.
The hippocampus is also involved in spatial navigation
(O’
Keefe, 1990) and in motor sequence consolidation (Albouy
et al., 2008) suggesting that motor skill learning and motor
fitness can have impact on hippocampal volume without any
cardio-respiratory change. In this respect, Niemann et al. (2014)
tested whether 12 months of cardiovascular or coordination
training induces larger increases in hippocampal volume in
healthy older participants. After training, the cardio-vascular
group revealed a significant volume increase in the left HC
of 4.22% and a non-significant increase of 2.98% for the right
HC. Effects of the coordinative training were more pronounced
in the right HC with an increase of 3.91%, whereas the
changes in the left HC (1.78%) were non-significant. Further
correlation analyses between motor fitness and hippocampal
volume failed to reach significant results. Still there is compelling
evidence that the human brain undergoes morphological
alterations in response to motor-skill learning (Draganski
et al., 2004; Boyke et al., 2008; Taubert et al., 2010; Sehm
et al., 2014). Along these lines, a recent study demonstrated
structural brain changes already after two sessions of dynamic
balance training that correlated with the individual motor
skill learning success of the participants (Taubert et al.,
2010). Sehm et al. (2014) could demonstrate that 6 weeks
of balance training induced increases in the gray matter of
the left HC in healthy seniors. These findings highlight the
behavioral relevance of structural brain plasticity in the HC
for the learning process. Hüfner et al. (2011) stated that long-
term balance training with its extensive vestibular, visual and
sensorimotor stimulation is associated with altered hippocampal
formation volumes in professional ballet dancers and slackliners.
Hence, the HC seems not only crucial for long-term memory
consolidation, learning and spatial navigation, but also for
balancing. Intact balance is essential for social mobility and
quality of life in aging (Dordevic et al., 2017). Hence,
physical intervention programs should take this function into
account, too.
In this respect dancing seems to be a promising intervention
since it requires the integration of sensory information from
multiple channels (auditory, vestibular, visual, somatosensory)
and the fine-grained motor control of the whole body. Behavioral
studies have already provided evidence of better performance
in balance and memory tasks in elderly dancers (Kattenstroth
et al., 2010, 2013; Rehfeld et al., 2014), but the underlying
neural mechanisms have not been addressed comprehensively
so far. Knowing that aerobic, sensorimotor and cognitive
training contribute to hippocampal volume, which also seems
to be associated with balancing capabilities, we initialized a
prospective, randomized longitudinal trial over a period of
18 months in healthy seniors. Two interventions were compared:
a specially designed dance program, during which subjects
constantly had to learn new choreographies, and a traditional
fitness program with mainly repetitive exercises, such as cycling
on an ergometer or Nordic walking. Whole-brain analyzes of
the acquired data using voxel based morphometry had shown
dance-associated volume increases mainly in the precentral and
the parahippocampal gyrus (Müller et al., 2016). Knowing that
dancing/slacklining (Hüfner et al., 2011) and endurance sport
(e.g., Erickson et al., 2011) have different impact on anterior and
posterior parts of the hippocampus in the present analysis we ran
a region of interest analysis of this specific brain region. To do so
we first computed a restricted VBM analysis with a hippocampal
mask. In the next step we divided the hippocampus in five
subfields in order to allow a detailed analysis of the interventions’
effects on different parts of the HC. The hippocampus is not a
homogeneous structure but consists of histologically specialized
subfields, such as the subiculum, cornu ammonis (CA) 1–
4
and dentate gyrus (DG). The subiculum has been implicated
in working memory and spatial relations (Riegert et al., 2004;
O’
Mara, 2005). CA3 and DG have been suggested to be involved
in memory and early retrieval, whereas CA1 in late retrieval,
consolidation and recognition. Especially the DG is one of
the few regions of the adult brain where neurogenesis takes
places, which is important in the formation of new memories
and spatial memory (Saab et al., 2009). Nevertheless all these
subfields are tightly interconnected (Duvernoy, 2005). Since
dancing seems to promote spatial orientation, working memory
and might promote neurogenesis, we expected volume changes
in more subfields of the HC after this intervention. Moreover,
given the importance of intact balance for successful aging on
the one hand and its dependence on the hippocampus on the
other hand, we also assessed effects of the interventions on
balancing capabilities and their relation to hippocampal subfield
volumes.

Dancing Induces Hippocampal Plasticity
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Subjects
This investigation, comprising hippocampal volume alterations
and changes in balance abilities, is part of a large prospective
longitudinal study which compares the effects of dancing versus
aerobic training on brain structure and function, mediating
neuroplasticity factors, such as BDNF, as well as cognitive
and motor performances in healthy elderly seniors. The
cognitive development and BDNF changes are highlighted in
our recent report (see Müller et al., 2017). The intervention
was provided for 18 months and contained three time-points
of measurement: baseline pre-test, first post-test after 6 months
of training and second post-test after 18 months of training
(see Figure 1). Again, the temporal dynamics of gray matter
brain plasticity are already stated by Müller et al. (2017),
showing a significant increase of gray matter volume in
parahippocampal gyrus only for the dancers. Based on that
finding, we assume only changes from baseline to the second
post-test (18 months).
The approval for the study was obtained from the ethics
committee of the Otto von Guericke University, Magdeburg.
All subjects signed a written informed consent and received a
reimbursement for their participation.
The timeline of the study can be depicted from Figure 1.
Primarily, we invited 62 healthy elderly volunteers aged
63–
80 years for cognitive and physical screening as well as
for verification of magnetic resonance imaging suitability.
Exclusion criteria were defined as follows: any history of
severe neurological conditions, metal implants, claustrophobia,
tinnitus, intensive physical engagement (more than 1 h/week),
cognitive impairments as evidenced in the MMSE (Folstein
et al., 1975) and depressive symptoms (BDI-II > 13) (Beck
et al., 2006). Fifty two seniors met the inclusion criteria and
were then randomly assigned to the experimental dance group
and the control sport group. After 18 months of training we
were left with 26 complete data sets, including 14 dancers and
12 sportsmen. Both groups (mean age = 67.9 ± 3.3 years)
did not differ concerning age, sex, education, and BMI.

Interventions
The precise description of the interventions is published
elsewhere (Müller et al., 2016). In brief, the first period of
training was provided for 6 months, twice a week for both
groups. Each dancing or fitness class lasted 90 min. Because of
organizational reasons we had to change the training frequency
from twice a week to once a week after 6 months of training.
The second training period was run for 12 months and the
training sessions were reduced to once a week for 90 min in both
groups. The content of the dance classes induced a permanent
learning situation with constantly changing choreographies,
which participants had to memorize accurately. The training
focused on elementary longitudinal turns, head-spins, shifts
of center of gravity (COG), single-leg stances, skips and

hops, different steps like chassée, mambo, cha cha, grapevine,
jazz square to challenge the balance system. Additional arm-
patterns enforced imbalances (moving arms away from center of
pressure).
The program for the sport group was adjusted according to
the recommended guidelines for health sport (Brehm et al., 2006)
and included endurance training, strength-endurance training,
and flexibility training (stretching and mobility). Each part
of the mentioned topics (endurance; strength-endurance; and
flexibility) was exercised for 20 min, whereby a 10 min warm-up,
a 10 min cool-down and short breaks between the different
exercises adding to another 10 min completed each 90 min lasting
session. So both groups exercised for 90 min in each training
session. In the first 6 months, endurance training was performed
on bicycle ergometers with the intensity adjusted to the individual
training heart rate (HR) using the Karvonen Formula:
Target training HR =
Resting HR + (0.6[maximum HR − resting HR]).
The factor 0.6 is a representative for an extensive aerobic
training (Davis and Convertino, 1975). In the second training
period (12 months) the participants completed a Nordic Walking
program. The strength-endurance training aimed to strengthen
major muscles of the muscular skeleton. In this program we

avoided combined arm and leg movements in order to keep
coordinative demands low.
Structural MRI Acquisition,
Preprocessing, and Analysis
Magnetic resonance (MR) images were acquired on a 3 Tesla
Siemens MAGNETOM Verio (Syngo MR B17) using a 32-
channel head coil. T-1 weighted MPRAGE sequence (224 sagital
slices, voxel size: 0.8 mm × 0.8 mm × 0.8 mm, TR: 2500 ms,
TE: 3.47 ms, TI: 1100 ms, flip angle: 7◦) were analyzed using
region of interest (ROI) defined voxel-based morphometry with
SPM 12 (Welcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London,
United Kingdom) running under Matlab (The Math Works). The
data preprocessing involved gray matter segmentation, DARTEL
based template creation, spatial normalization to MNI-Space
and an 5 mm smoothing with a Gaussian kernel as previously
described.
Voxel-Based Morphometry with
Hippocampal Mask
In order to incorporate our a priori hypotheses concerning
hippocampal gray matter volume changes we first conducted a
ROI-VBM with hippocampal masks. The longitudinal analysis
for hippocampal gray matter volume changes was performed
using repeated measurement ANOVAs in a full factorial design.
We applied a threshold of p < 0.05 (FDR corrected).
Hippocampal Subfield Volume
Measurements
In a second step we analyzed volume changes in five subfields
of the HC. Up to now there is no real gold standard
in analyzing HC subfield volumes and each of the current
manifold analytic techniques has its strengths and weaknesses
(Bandettini, 2009; Kuhnt et al., 2013). Here for the hippocampal
subfield segmentation in order to obtain ROI volumes we
chose the SPM ANATOMY Toolbox v.2.2.c (Eickhoff et al.,
2007) with normalized images. This segmentation included
the cornu ammonis (CA1–
CA3), the dentate gyrus (DG,
including CA4) and the subiculum (Figure 2). In SPM Anatomy
toolbox, definition of anatomical regions is based on maximum
probability cytoarchitectonic maps.
Postural Control
Postural control was assessed with the Sensory Organization Test
(SOT) implemented in the Balance Master System (Neurocom
International, Inc., United States). This test provides information
about the contribution of the visual, somatosensory, and
vestibular system to the maintenance of balance. The system
consists of a dual force platform including force transducers
measuring the angular displacement of the COG under certain
conditions and visual surround. Both, visual surround and
platform enable anterior/posterior sway and this sway can
be assessed under different conditions. The six conditions
are: normal vision and fixed support (condition 1), absent
vision and fixed support (condition 2), sway-referenced vision
and fixed support (condition 3), normal vision and sway-
referenced support (condition 4), absent vision and sway
referenced support (condition 5), and sway-referenced vision
and sway-referenced support (condition 6). These conditions
were performed in three trials for 20 s, resulting in equilibrium
scores. Those equilibrium scores range from 0% (balance loss)
to 100% (perfect stability). From the equilibrium scores a
sensory analysis was performed by calculating average scores
of specific pairs of SOT conditions: the participant’
s ability
to use input from the somatosensory system to maintain
balance is reflected by the average of condition 2 divided
by the average of condition 1, the contribution of the
visual system by the average of condition 4 divided by the
average of condition 1 and that of the vestibular system
by the average of condition 5 divided by the average of
condition 1.
The composite score was calculated by averaging the score for
conditions 1 and 2; adding these two scores to the equilibrium
scores from each trial of sensory conditions 3, 4, 5, and 6; and
dividing that sum by the total number of trials (NeuroCom Natus
Medical Incorporated, 2008).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis of hippocampal volumes and balance data
were performed with SPSS (SPSS 22, inc./IBM). Intervention
effects were tested using repeated-measurement ANOVAs
with group (dance, sport) as between-subject factor and
time (pre, post) as within-subject factor. Hereby, age, gender,
and total hippocampal volume were included as covariates.

The presentation of the results is structured as follows. We first

In the next step we investigated balance data and finally we
looked for correlations between improvements in balance and
hippocampal volume.

group significant volume increases in the right hippocampus
[MNI-coordinates: x = 29, y = −16, z = −27; p(FDR) = 0.001,

of hippocampal subfield volumes showed a main effect of time
regarding left CA1, left CA2, left and right subiculum and
left CA4/dentate gyrus (Table 2). There were no significant
interactions with group. Paired t-tests showed significant
volume increases for the dancers in left CA1, left CA2, left
CA4/dentate gyrus and left and right subiculum and for
the sportsmen in the left CA1, left CA2, and left subiculum
(Figure 4).
Postural Control
Repeated measurement ANOVAs of balance data showed an
interaction effect with group for the composite equilibrium score
(see Table 3 and Figure 5).
There was a main effect of time regarding the somatosensory
and vestibular contribution but no significant time × group
interaction effects after 18 months of training (see Table 3). Post
hoc tests revealed that the dancers improved in the use of all
three sensory systems somatosensory system [t(13) = −2.902,
p = 0.004], visual system [t(12) = −2.525, p = 0.027] vestibular
system [t(12) = −3.271, p = 0.007] to maintain balance.
Members of the sports group improved in the use of the
somatosensory system [t(9) = −3.579, p = 0.006] and the
vestibular system [t(9) = −3.881, p = 0.004] but not in the visual
system. Table 3 presents an overview of significant alterations
related to employment of sensory information to maintain
balance from baseline to post-intervention for both groups.
Correlation Analysis
Correlation analysis between all hippocampal subfields and
balance did not yield any significant results irrespective of
whether the groups were analyzed separately or jointly.
DISCUSSION
Animal research has shown that combining aerobic training
with sensory enrichment has a superior effect on inducing
neuroplasticity in the HC compared to physical exercise or
sensory stimulation alone (Kempermann et al., 2010). This
sparked our idea to investigate the impact on neuroplasticity
in elderly humans of a specially designed, sensorimotor and
cognitive challenging dance program in comparison to a classical
cardiovascular fitness program. In addition to our previous work
(Müller et al., 2017), in the present study we ran a dedicated ROI
analysis, which was focused on subfield volumes of the HC. The
HC is of special interest as this brain structure is (a) especially
affected by normal and pathological aging and (b) plays a key role
in major cognitive processes, e.g., memory and learning and (c) is
also involved in keeping one’
s balance, a function which is crucial
for well-being and quality of life.
We observed that both, dancing and fitness training led to
increases in hippocampal subfield volumes. Although there was
no significant group × time interaction in the ANOVA omnibus

analysis, exploratory post hoc t-tests indicated that participants
of the dance group showed volume increases in more subfields
(four out of five, including the DG) of the left HC and that
only dancing led to an increase in one subfield of the right HC,
namely the subiculum. Regarding balance abilities dancing was
superior to standard fitness as expressed by a larger increase
in the composite score of our balance test and improved use
of all three sensory systems. We, however, did not observe a
correlation between changes in HC subfield volumes changes
and those in balance; in other words whether the observed
skill improvement can be attributed to the HC cannot be fully
answered yet.
Regarding the HC volume increases observed in both groups,
our results support the assumption that HC volume can be
enhanced by physical fitness alone, as this was the overlapping
feature of both trainings. Animal studies have shown that adult
neurogenesis takes place mainly in the DG part of the HC
(van Praag et al., 1999). Interestingly, only the dancers showed an
increase in this brain region. Whether adult neurogenesis was
indeed the basis of the here observed volume change, however,
must remain an open question as there is no direct way in
addressing this process in humans.
The dancers showed increases in some HC subfields where
there was no change to be observed in the sports group. This
indicates that apart from physical fitness, other factors inherent in
dancing, contribute to HC volume changes, too. Animal research
has suggested that sensory enrichment may be such a factor
whereby physical fitness and enrichment have different effects on
HC neurons: running in a wheel generates new neurons in the
HC of mice but these only survive when sensory stimulation is
also present (Kempermann et al., 2010). Again, with our own data
we cannot differentiate between these different processes. We
nevertheless can conclude that the additional challenges involved
in our dance program, namely cognitive and sensorimotor
stimulation, induced extra HC volume changes in addition to
those attributable to physical fitness alone. It is noteworthy, that
other studies in elderly humans, which did not boost physical
fitness but which were sensorimotor demanding, such as learning
to juggle (Boyke et al., 2008), have observed HC volume increases
as well.
Only the dancers showed an increased balance composite
score and they improved in all three involved sensory systems.
This indicates that dancing drives all three senses and presumably
also improves the integration of sensorimotor, visual and
vestibular information. Balancing is an important everyday
function, crucial for example for social mobility. Impaired
balance often results in falls, which constitutes a major health
risk factor with consequences both on morbidity (and even
mortality) and health care costs (see also Dordevic et al., 2017).
Although the ability to balance has been also linked to the
HC and its connections, for example, to the vestibular system
(Brandt et al., 2005), we did not observe a correlation between
HC subfield volumes and improvements in balance. Given the
small size of our sample, this needs to be interpreted with care but
may suggest that other brain regions, probably those described
in our earlier analysis (Müller et al., 2017) were involved in
these improvements or that changes in the HC other than
those expressed in measurable volumes, e.g., synaptic function,
perfusion, etc. contributed to this effect.
There are other limitations in the present study which
should not be left unmentioned. As already mentioned above
(see Materials and Methods), we had to change the training
intervention frequency from twice a week to once a week after
6 months of training. Hence, it must remain unclear whether
more pronounced effects could have been observed if we had
been able to stick to the initial training intensity. Next the
ANOVAs failed to reach significant group interaction effects,
only the exploratory t-tests became significant which may be

a consequence of the large number of factors and levels in
the ANOVAs on the one hand, and the small sample size
on the other hand. A further limitation can be seen in the
use of fully automated segmentation tools. Finally, the small
sample size accompanied by a high drop-out rate as well as
the highly selective inclusion, a missing inactive control group
and exclusion criteria must be mentioned as they limit the
generalizability of our results.
In sum, the present results indicate that both dance and fitness
training can induce hippocampal plasticity in the elderly, but only
dance training improved balance capabilities.
However, larger studies with more representative samples
are required in the future. They should include additional
analysis of mediating factors and they should try to find ways to
optimally adjust the training protocol to an individual’
s needs and
preferences. Most of all, it needs to be investigated in longitudinal
randomized clinical trials whether the proposed interventions
indeed have the potential to reduce or postpone the risk of
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’
s as suggested in
large non-interventional studies (Verghese et al., 2003).
