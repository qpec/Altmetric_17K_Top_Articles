Abstract
Clinically useful molecular tools to triage women for a
biopsy upon referral to colposcopy are not available. We aimed
to develop a molecular panel to detect cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 or higher lesions (CIN2þ) in women
with abnormal cervical cytology and high-risk HPV (HPVþ). We
tested a biomarker panel in cervical epithelium DNA obtained
from 211 women evaluated in a cervical cancer clinic in Chile
from 2006 to 2008. Results were verified in a prospective cohort
of 107 women evaluated in a high-risk clinic in Puerto Rico
from 2013 to 2015. Promoter methylation of ZNF516, FKBP6,
and INTS1 discriminated cervical brush samples with CIN2þ
lesions from samples with no intraepithelial lesions or malig-
nancy (NILM) with 90% sensitivity, 88.9% specificity, 0.94 area
under the curve (AUC), 93.1% positive predictive value (PPV),
and 84.2% negative predictive value (NPV). The panel results
were verified in liquid-based cervical cytology samples from an
independent cohort with 90.9% sensitivity, 60.9% specificity,
0.90 AUC, 52.6% PPV, and 93.3% NPV, after adding HPV16-L1
methylation to the panel. Next-generation sequencing results in
HPVþ cultured cells, and urine circulating cell-free DNA
(ccfDNA) were used to design assays that show clinical feasi-
bility in a subset (n ¼ 40) of paired plasma (AUC ¼ 0.81) and
urine (AUC ¼ 0.86) ccfDNA samples obtained from the pro-
spective cohort. Viral and host DNA methylation panels can be
tested in liquid cytology and urine ccfDNA from women
referred to colposcopy, to triage CIN2þ lesions for biopsy and
inform personalized screening algorithms. Cancer Prev Res; 9(12);

Introduction
Rapid advances in genomic technologies and The Cancer
Genome Atlas project (TCGA) have revealed extensive, previously
unsuspected complexity and heterogeneity in human cancers.
This heterogeneity has led to calls for "precision medicine" to
address the complex genetic and epigenetic processes that under-
lie somatic cell evolution to malignancy. Precision medicine
efforts are underway to understand how contextual, clinical, and
molecular data can be integrated to develop personalized treat-
ment, preventive, early detection, and screening programs. Per-
sonalized treatment in the post-genomic era is a new creative and
scientific endeavor that aims to integrate large datasets and
disparate tools and methodologies into a new continuum with
clinical and public health relevance. In this article, we use a Phase
II Biomarker Development Trial framework to integrate tools
from the fields of molecular epidemiology, early detection, and
genomics to engineer a precision medicine instrument for cervical
cancer screening, based on DNA sequence changes in methylation
and mutations in the somatic human and HPV genomes.

 Cervical cancer screening is undergoing a major transformation
worldwide with the adoption of testing for the presence of
oncogenic HPV types (1, 2). Testing for high-risk HPV genotypes
(hrHPV) has recently been shown to be a better indicator of
cervical cancer risk than the cytology test (3–5). Several countries
have changed their cervical cancer screening guidelines, accord-
ingly. In the United States, hrHPV co-testing with Pap is recom-
mended for women 30 years and older (6). In the Netherlands, 5-
yearly cytologic screening for women aged 30 to 60 years is being
replaced by primary HPV screening. HPV-positive women will be
referred to colposcopy in case of abnormal cytology and the
screening interval for hrHPV-negative women older than 40 years
will increase to 10 years, in an effort to achieve a balance between
safety and screening burden (7). However, clinical management
of women with hrHPV and abnormal cytology results is not firmly
established (8–10) because it cannot predict who is more likely to
develop cervical carcinoma (11, 12).
When women test positive for Pap and hrHPV, they are rou-
tinely sent to colposcopy, during which most are biopsied. The
majority of these biopsy results are either negative or CIN1
lesions, which regress to normal epithelium in less than 24
months (13). Nevertheless, a small percentage of hrHPV infec-
tions is associated with progression from low-grade squamous
intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
grade 3 (CIN3) lesions and close to 30% of CIN3 lesions progress
to cervical cancer (14, 15).
Methylation of host and HPV DNA genes has been examined as
a marker of progression in cervical cancer. Several groups have
shown links between host DNA methylation or methylated HPV
DNA and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia progression, carcino-
ma in situ, or cervical cancer (CIN2þ), or from women with hrHPV
(16–25). Some studies have reported a positive association
between CIN2þ and methylation of CpG sites in host and viral
DNA isolated from liquid cytology samples (16, 25–29). Yet,
there are no agreed upon clinical tests of progression (15, 30).
Recent reports have explored the use of urine-based hrHPV
testing, as a complementary approach to liquid cytology for
cervical cancer screening, in an attempt to identify less invasive
screening technologies (31, 32). Most of the studies have failed to
attain clinical usefulness, as they are limited by poor sensitivity;
inappropriate protocols for DNA extraction from circulating cell-
free DNA (ccfDNA) in urine; and the limit of detection of the HPV
assays utilized (33–35). Most of the studies also fail to recognize
the importance of using DNA isolation methods optimized to
enrich for ccfDNA that crosses the kidneys and can be obtained as
fragmented DNA in urine (36).
In the current study, we test whether a high-throughput panel of
methylated viral and human genes can identify women with
CIN2þ lesions in liquid-based cervical cytology and urine
ccfDNA. Participants from 2 independent cohorts consented in
high-risk cervical cancer clinics in Chile and Puerto Rico provided
the samples for this study. The panel is composed of 3 genes we
previously found to be frequently methylated in cervical neopla-
sia, associated with hrHPV status and ethnicity in an unbiased
genome-wide study (19). The current retrospective study was
performed in DNA extracted from cervical brush biopsies in a
Chilean population. The results were confirmed in liquid-based
cytology samples obtained from patients enrolled in a prospective
study in Puerto Rico, adding HPV16-L1 gene methylation to
increase sensitivity. The panel was also tested in ccfDNA isolated
from paired liquid-based cytology, serum, and urine samples,
obtained from the prospective cohort in Puerto Rico. Next-gen-
eration sequencing (NGS) platforms were used to produce per-
sonalized maps of the HPV genome and epigenome from urine
ccfDNA and to populate cloud-based servers that can be used to
track hrHPV DNA throughout the life course, as we move toward
personalized cervical cancer screening solutions.

#NA_00020633. The IRB of the Doctor Hern�
an Henríquez Ara-
vena TertiaryCare Regional Hospital, in Temuco, Chile,and IRB of
the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine also approved
this protocol. Patients in both cohorts were treatment-na€
�ve, had
never participated in a clinical study, or had a history of cancer.
Patient characteristics are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Phase II biomarker development trial for molecular markers of
CIN2þ
We designed a phase II biomarker development trial to identify
methylated biomarkers of CIN2þ in cervical epithelium and urine
samples. We selected 3 genes FKBP6, INTS1, and ZNF516 that we
previously showed were associated with cervical cancer and abnor-
mal cytology in a phase I Biomarker Development Trial (Supple-
mentary Fig. S1A; ref. 19). To support the use of these targeted
genes in a clinical assay, we first performed immunohistochem-
istry (IHC) to identify the differential distribution and localization
of the expressed proteins in normal cervical mucosa samples and
cervical carcinoma tissue samples from Chile. The IHC results
revealed the 3 genes, FKBP6, INTS1, and ZNF516, we differentially
expressed in normal and cervical cancer epithelium (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S1B). We then used quantitative methylation-specific PCR
(qMSP) to examine the association between CIN2þ biopsies and
methylation of these 3 genes (ZNF516, FKBP6, and INTS1) in
cervical brush epithelium from a retrospective cohort of women in
Chile. We subsequently verified the association between CIN2þ
biopsies and methylation of FKBP6, INTS1, ZNF516, and HPV16-
L1 in liquid-based cytology samples obtained from an indepen-
dent prospective cohort of women in Puerto Rico (Supplementary
Fig. S1C). An overview of the workflow for tissue processing,
including nucleic acid extraction, prior discovery using MeDIP-
chip, IHC confirmation of targeted biomarkers, NGS, high-
throughput PCR quantification of genomic and bisulfite-treated
DNA, and cloud-based alignment and visualization tools is pro-
vided in Supplementary Fig. S1D and described in detail in the
Supplementary Experimental Procedures.
Sequencing the hrHPV genome in urine ccfDNA
We isolated urine ccfDNA using Q-Sepharose anion exchange
resin followed by a silica-based elution with LiCl, as described in
the Supplementary Experimental Procedures. To examine the
hrHPV genome in urine ccfDNA, we developed custom dual-
sequence capture baits to enrich samples for hrHPV DNA from 12
high-risk types (HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and
59). We used liquid-based sequence capture baits to measure the
hrHPV genome in urine ccfDNA from women with and without
cervical premalignant lesions. DNA sequencing libraries were

 prepared following published protocols and enriched using cus-
tom capture reagents. HPV-specific, biotinylated, long oligonu-
cleotide probes were designed, synthesized and pooled for target
selection and enrichment utilizing the SeqCap EZ (Roche/Nim-
bleGen) dual capture approach for gDNA enrichment. To assess
the enrichment efficiency of the dual-sequence capture method
on clinical samples, we compared hrHPV ccfDNA-qPCR assay
results obtained on 8 pre- and postcapture HPV-enriched circu-
lating DNA samples obtained from patients with CIN1 (n ¼ 4)
and CIN2-3 (n ¼ 4), as described in Supplementary Experimental
Procedures.
We used massively parallel NGS to quantify the different HPV
genotypes present in urineccfDNA from 7 patients with CIN1(n ¼
3) and CIN2–3 (n ¼ 4) lesions, using DNA from 2 cervical cancer
cell lines (HeLa and CSCC7) as positive controls. The DNA was
enriched for hrHPV DNA with the custom dual-sequence capture
hrHPV assay prior to multiplexed sequencing on a GS Junior Plus
454 (Roche) system. The Roche GS Analysis Software Suite was
used to perform signal processing, QC, and initial alignments of
the gDNA sequencing reads. To determine the HPV genotype,
composition reads were aligned to the PapillomaVirus Episteme
(PAVE) genome database of HPV genomes (37) and to custom
servers that can be used for personalized tracking of HPV geno-
types longitudinally.
Sequencing and visualizing the hrHPV epigenome in urine
ccfDNA
To examine the hrHPV genome in urine ccfDNA, we used the
Sure Select Methyl-Seq Target Enrichment (Agilent) assay to
enrich DNA samples from 2 HPV16-positive cervical cancer cell
lines, CaSki (ATCC CRL-1550, 600 integrated HPV16 copies) and
SiHa (ATCC HTB35, 2 integrated HPV16 copies); 2 HPV16-
positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell
lines, SCC-47 and SCC-90; and urine ccfDNA from 2 clinical
samples: one from a patient with ASCUS and CIN1 (TrDNA47)
and another one from a patient with high-grade cervical SIL
(HSIL) and CIN3 (TrDNA50). Samples were PCR-amplified using
sample-specific indexed ("barcoding") primers for multiplexed
sequencing on a MiSeq (Illumina) system. The bisulfite-converted
DNA reads were analyzed using the Bismark version 0.13.0 suite
of tools (38) and Bowtie 2 version 2.1.0. Reads from the FASTQ
files were aligned to all HPV types in the PAVE database, before
performing the CpG methylation analysis of hrHPV genomes.
Identification of hrHPV and methylation biomarkers of CIN2þ
in urine ccfDNA
We designed quantitative PCR amplification assays for b-actin
and the HPV E1 region to detect hrHPV in plasma/serum and
urine ccfDNA. This ccfDNA hrHPV qPCR assay amplifies an HPV
E1 region common to 13 hrHPV types (HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39,
45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68). The resulting amplicon is 93 bp.
Primers were obtained from Invitrogen. We also designed qMSP
primers to test DNA methylation of host (ZNF516, FKBP6, and
INTS1) and viral DNA (HPV16-L1) in urine ccfDNA.
Bioinformatics and cloud-based tools for personalized cervical
cancer screening
A suite of bioinformatics tools was developed to analyze the
HPV genotype composition and quantify the HPV methylome in
ccfDNA. The Supplementary Experimental Procedures describe
how each clinical sample sequence was aligned against the non-
redundant PAVE genome database. Cloud-based tools were devel-
oped to provide alignment and visualization tools that can be
used by patients, providers, insurance personnel, and researchers.
GenoScape was developed to perform hrHPV genotype profiling
from high-throughput sequencing samples. GenoScape consists of
4 analytic steps: (i) high-throughput sequencing (454, MiSeq) of
HPV TrDNA; (ii) profiling by comparing sequences against several
databases such as human genome (bowtie), HPV databases:
GenBank, PaVE, Enterix-HPV Hi-lo risk (sim4db) and RefSeq
bacterial genomes (blast); (iii) assembly into contigs, for Align-
Scape visualization (newbler, minimus, trinity); and (iv) SNP
discovery (Supplementary Fig. S2A). MethylScape was developed
to provide large-scale and close-up visualization of the HPV
methylome. MethylScape consists of 4 steps: (i) Bisulfite sequenc-
ing of HPV DNA; (ii) bioinformatics profiling by comparing C!T
modified sequences against the following C!T modified data-
bases - Human genome (bowtie), HPV databases: GenBank, PaVE,
Enterix-HPV Hi-lo risk (sim4db), and RefSeq bacterial genomes
(blast); (iii) assemble reads into contigs for visualization as an
optional tool (newbler,minimus, trinity); and (iv) methylation site/
level discovery (samtools þ rddChecker filters; Supplementary Fig.
S2B). MethylScape can be used for large-scale and close-up visu-
alization of HPV methylomes. Large-scale view shows exact or
smoothed (bsmooth) methylation levels along the HPV genome/
contigs. Close-up view shows bisulfite "alignments" of individual
CpG methylation sites (Supplementary Fig. S2C). We also devel-
oped AlignScape, a cloud-based tool which allows the comparative
alignment and sequence variation visualization of HPV genomes
uploaded by users against a reference genome of interest (39).
Results
Identification of methylation biomarkers of CIN2þ in cervical
brush and liquid-based cytology samples
After removing samples without a definitive biopsy result, we
examined the promoter methylation frequency of 3 genes
(ZNF516, FKBP6, and INTS1) in cervical brush samples from
women with normal (n ¼ 34), CIN1 (n ¼ 34), CIN2 (n ¼ 33),
CIN3 (n ¼ 20), and cervical cancer (n ¼ 90) pathology reports. We
compared samples from women with no intraepithelial lesions or
malignancy (NILM) and CIN1 lesions with samples from women
with CIN2þ lesions and found that ZNF516 has 91.7% sensitivity,
27.4% specificity, and an AUC of 0.62; FKBP6 has 92.4% sensi-
tivity, 46.8% specificity, and an AUC of 0.68; INTS1 has 93.8%
sensitivity, 30.3% specificity, and an AUC of 0.57. We then
compared samples from women with NILM to samples from
women with CIN2þ lesions, we found that ZNF516 has 91.7%
sensitivity, 38.9% specificity, and an AUC of 0.76; FKBP6 has
90.9% sensitivity, 67.6% specificity, and an AUC of 0.86; INTS1
has 90.7% sensitivity, 40.5% specificity, and an AUC of 0.62.
The panel of 3 classifiers (ZNF516, FKBP6, and INTS1) has 90%
sensitivity, 88.9% specificity, an AUC of 0.93, a positive predictive
value (PPV) of 93.1%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of
84.2%, when comparing women with NILM with women with
CIN2þ lesions (Fig. 1A and B and Table 1).
We then tested this panel of 3 classifiers in liquid-based
cytology samples (n ¼ 67) from women in Puerto Rico, a subset
of which had been previously tested for concordance of hrHPV
genotype between cervical cytology and urine DNA (31). We
compared samples from women with NILM and CIN1 lesions
with samples from women with CIN2þ lesions and found that

 ZNF516 has 72.7% sensitivity, 48.1% specificity, and an AUC of

of 0.50; INTS1 has 91% sensitivity, 35% specificity, and an AUC of
0.66. We also tested the performance of HPV16-L1 methylation,
using previously designed primers and probes (40), and found it
had 63.6% sensitivity, 57.7% specificity, and an AUC of 0.54 (Fig.
1C). Then, we compared samples from women with NILM with
samples from women with CIN2þ lesions, we found that ZNF516
has 63.6% sensitivity, 17.4% specificity, and an AUC of 0.50;
FKBP6 has 63.6% sensitivity, 39.1% specificity, and an AUC of
0.50; INTS1 has 63.6% sensitivity, 39.1% specificity, and an AUC
of 0.47. We also tested the performance of HPV16-L1 methylation
and found it had 63.6% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and an AUC
of 0.79.
The panel of 4 classifiers in cervical cytology samples, ZNF516,
FKBP6, INTS1, and HPV16-L1 has 90.9% sensitivity, 60.9% spec-

comparing NILM with CIN2þ lesions (Fig. 1D and Table 2).

 estimated efficiency for the assay, the approximate fold enrich-
ment was greater than 1,700. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S3B
with data representing 5 clinical samples, the average DCt value for
precapture versus postcapture samples enriched for hrHPV
ccfDNA was 11.07, for an average fold enrichment of 670 of
hrHPV ccfDNA in clinical samples.
We then examined whether the hrHPV ccfDNA -qPCR assay
could discriminate urine ccfDNA isolated from women, with and
without cervical dysplasia. Supplementary Figure S3C shows the
amplification curves for the hrHPV ccfDNA -qPCR assay on
ccfDNA from CIN2–3 (n ¼ 14), CIN1 (n ¼ 13), and 10 samples
from women with NILM. The frequency of amplified premalig-
nant lesion samples differed significantly from NILM samples:
NILM (30%), CIN1 (77%, P ¼ 0.02), and CIN2þ (71%, P ¼ 0.04).
Sequencing the hrHPV epigenome in urine ccfDNA
The multiplexed massively parallel sequencing runs pro-
duced 230,385 reads with an average length of 138.3 bp. The
reads in the clinical samples covered 82% to 100% of the
reference HPV16 and 73% to 100% of the HPV18 genomes,
with an average of 21% (HPV16) to 33% (HPV18) percentage
of all reads mapping to the sequences. These results were
comparable to the percentage of all reads that mapped to the
reference sequences in the positive control samples: 92% of the
CSCC7 reads mapped on target covering 77% of the HPV16
genome and 89% of the HeLa reads mapped to 67% of HPV18,
as expected (Supplementary Table S2). Samples TrDNA_445
and TrDNA_455 had more than 80% of their reads mapped to
HPV16 and HPV18; however, the remaining 5 samples were
split, mapping to both HPV16 and HPV18 genotypes, as well as
other subtypes (Supplementary Table S2B).
To resolve the remaining reads, we searched the human genome
using the program Bowtie (41) and then a local copy of the database
of NCBI reference bacterial genomes, using BLAST (43). Following
this tiered mapping approach, only a small number of reads were
still unmapped, a small number of which (<50) were linker con-
taminants,whereastheotherscouldpotentiallyrepresentnovelHPV

Cloud-based visualization tools for personalized cervical
cancer screening
Our demonstration of cloud-based servers shows the align-
ment results of 11 hrHPV types, 9 low-risk HPV types, and 7
clinical samples (TrDNA-445, TrDNA-455, TrDNA-456, TrDNA-
481, TrDNA-504, TrDNA-513, and TrDNA-571) against a refer-
ence genome (HPV16). The large-scale HPV DNA server (43)
produces a graphical "large-scale" view of the pairwise alignments
of 20 HPV genomes against a reference genome (HPV16 in this
demo), together with annotations of genome rearrangement
events (Supplementary Fig. S5A). The "close-up" HPV DNA server
(44) computes and displays nucleotide-level ("close-up") multi-
ple alignments of sequences in a 1-kb region starting at a user-
specified address or gene in the reference genome (Supplementary
Fig. S5B).
Sequencing the hrHPV epigenome in urine ccfDNA
Reads from the FASTQ files were aligned to all HPV types in the
PAVE database and we performed CpG methylation analysis
using Bismark modified to analyze hrHPV genomes. The multi-
plexed massively parallel sequencing run produced 14,442,406
reads with an average length of 100 bp. The percentage of all reads
of the HPV-positive cervical cancer and HNSCC cell lines that
mapped uniquely to some of the reference genomes in the PAVE
database can be seen in the top of Supplementary Table S3: CaSki
(93%), SiHa (13%), SCC-047 (68%), and SCC-090 (87%).
Personalized HPV methylation landscapes
The percentage of methylation across the HPV genome in all 6
samples was obtained with the Methylator Extractor module in
Bismark (See Supplementary Experimental Procedures for a
detailed description). Scatterplots of the percentage of methyla-
tion by chromosomal location in the HPV genome for each of the
6 samples are shown in Fig. 2. The percentage of methylation is
shown on the y-axis of the top panel. The x-axis shows the
chromosomal location along the HPV genome for both panels,
including the promoters at positions 97 and 670 of the HPV
genome. The top panel of each plot represents the percentage of
CpG methylation, whereas the bottom panel of each plot repre-
sents the HPV genes and the upper regulatory region (45).
The different HPV genomes that aligned to the 6 samples are
shown in different colors and shapes (HPV16, black dots; HPV35,
red squares; HPV52, red triangles; and HPV71, green squares). The
2 cervical cancer cell lines had different patterns of CpG methyl-
ation. CaSki had overall higher levels of methylation than SiHa for
CpGs across the genome. SiHa exhibits a bimodal distribution of
methylation percentage. The majority of CpGs below the 3,500
position in the HPV genome have less than 60% methylation,
whereas CpGs located between 3,500 and 7,200 positions on the
HPV genome show more than 80% methylation. The methylation
patterns for both HPV-positive HNSCC cell lines were very similar
to those observed in CaSki. The clinical samples aligned to more

also aligned to additional HPV types. TrDNA-34 aligned to HPV16 and HPV35. TrDNA-50 aligned to HPV16, HPV52, and HPV71. Note that the methylation pattern
of HPV16 in CaSki is similar to the all the HPV16 patterns with the exception of SiHa, which is lower and may be due to the fact that it only has 2 copies
of HPV16.

 than one HPV type. TrDNA-34, a sample obtained from a patient
with ASCUS and CIN1, aligned to HPV16 and HPV35. TrDNA-50,
a sample obtained from a patient with HSIL and CIN3, aligned to
HPV16, HPV52, and HPV71. The methylation patterns of HPV16
in both clinical samples are very similar to the methylation
patterns observed in CaSki and both HNSCC cell lines, albeit
with less abundant number of reads, as expected. Methylation of
the remainder of HPV types was low overall.
To examine the HPV16 CpG methylation patterns, we
aligned the reads from the 4 cell lines to the HPV16 reference
genome. The mapping efficiency (the percentage of total reads
that aligned uniquely to the reference genome) to the HPV16
reference genome was very similar to the percentage of all reads
that mapped to the PAVE reference database for the 4 cell lines:
CaSki (91%), SiHa (13%), SCC-047 (66%), and SCC-090
(86%). The mapping efficiency of the reads from the HNSCC
cell lines to the HPV16 reference genome was in the range
between the mapping efficiency obtained with SiHa and CaSki,
namely, 86% for SCC-90 and 66% for SCC-47 (Supplementary
Table S3, middle). Because we know the number of copies of
HPV16 DNA in SiHa (2) and CaSki (�600), these sequencing
results may be a good indicator of the number of HPV copies
present in the HNSCC cell lines.
We then examined the mapping efficiency of the HPV16-L1–
specific CpG methylation patterns in the 4 cell lines and found
that with the exception of SiHa, (3%), there was hardly a
difference in the percentage of uniquely aligned reads: CaSki
(18%), TrDNA34 (15%), and TrDNA50 (15%) (Supplementary
Table S3, bottom).
The mapping efficiency to the PAVE database was orders of
magnitude less in clinical samples when compared with the
lowest mapping efficiency obtained in cell lines (SiHa): SiHa
(240,913 reads), TrDNA34 (1,848 reads), and TrDNA50 (4,869
reads), as can be seen in the top panel of Supplementary Table S3.
The mapping efficiency of the clinical samples when aligned to the
HPV16 reference database was also orders of magnitude less than
the one seen in SiHa: SiHa (236,809 reads), TrDNA34 (1,729
reads), and TrDNA50 (1,078 reads) as can be seen in the middle
panel of Supplementary Table S3. This difference in mapping
efficiency was also observed when we aligned the clinical samples
to the HPV16-L1 region: SiHa (46,872 reads), TrDNA34 (419
reads), and TrDNA50 (210 reads); as can be seen in the bottom
panel of Supplementary Table S3.
We wanted to assess whether methylation levels in the HPV16-
L1 variable region could be used as a marker of progression in
cervical cancer premalignant lesions. The mapping efficiency of
the 4 cell lines to the HPV-16 L1 gene was high: CaSki (81%), SiHa
(80%), SCC-47 (78%), and SCC-90 (82%). The mapping effi-
ciency of the clinical samples to the HPV16-L1 gene was as high as
for the positive controls: 76% for TrDNA34 and 81% for
TrDNA50 (Supplementary Table S4)
To further determine whether HPV16-L1 methylation levels can
be used as a surrogate marker of methylation of the HPV16
genome in urine ccfDNA, we examined the distribution of CpG
methylation after aligning the urine ccfDNA samples to the
HPV16-L1 gene. Box plots show the distribution of CpG meth-
ylation levels per sample after aligning to HPV16 (Supplementary
Fig. S6A) and HPV16-L1 region (Supplementary Fig. S6B). The
CpG methylation median in the clinical samples is significantly
higher than in the cell lines and higher in urine ccfDNA from the
CIN3 than from the CIN1 clinical sample (P < 0.05), as expected.
Quantification of viral and host DNA methylation in plasma
and urine ccfDNA
To enable the testing of this 4-gene panel in urine ccfDNA, we
optimized a previously published urine ccfDNA isolation method
and compared it with the gold standard, phenol–chloroform
DNA extraction method (Supplementary Table S5). We then
designed primers and TaqMan probes to quantify HPV16-L1 DNA
methylation and ZNF516, INTS1 and FKBP6 methylation in
fragmented urine ccfDNA using qMSP. Primers were designed to
amplify in urine ccfDNA short amplicons (80 basepairs long) of
the same genomic regions previously used to quantify HPV16-L1
methylation in HNSCC (40) and ZNF516, INTS1, and FKBP6 in
cervical cancer (19).
In a feasibility study, we found that HPV16-L1 qMSP meth-
ylation can discriminate bisulfite-treated cervical epithelium
DNA and urine ccfDNA from women with normal cytology
from women with dysplastic cytology and premalignant cervi-
cal lesions with high sensitivity and specificity (Supplementary
Fig. S7).
We then quantified the methylation levels of the panel of viral
and host DNA genes in plasma and urine ccfDNA samples. In
plasma, we found that the panel of 4 classifiers has 85.7%
sensitivity, 60.9% specificity, an AUC of 0.807, PPV of 40%, and
an NPV of 93.3%, when comparing women with NILM/CIN1 to
CIN2þ lesions (Fig. 3A). In urine ccfDNA, we found that the panel
of 4 classifiers has 75% sensitivity, 83.3% specificity, an AUC of
0.86, PPV of 50%, and an NPV of 93.8% when comparing women
with NILM/CIN1 to CIN2þ lesions (Fig. 3B).
Discussion
We used the formal criteria biomarker development created by
the National Cancer Institute Early Detection Research Network
(EDRN) to guide this research project. The goals and primary aims
for the EDRN, that is, the 5 phases of Biomarker Development
Trials (46), are listed in Supplementary Table S6. The main goal of
Phase II Biomarker Development Trials is to identify a clinical
assay that can detect the desired endpoint. We performed a Phase
II Biomarker Development Trial to identify a panel of methylated
HPV and human host genes that can discriminate between CIN2þ
and normal/CIN1 lesions in a reflex test performed in cervical
cytology samples and in ccfDNA in plasma and urine. Recogniz-
ing the previously unsuspected complexity and heterogeneity in
human cancers unveiled by rapid advances in genomic technol-
ogies, we adopted specific strategies from the fields of molecular
epidemiology, early detection, and genomics to engineer a pre-
cision medicine approach for cervical cancer screening. The spe-
cific tools include DNA sequence–based assays, such as qMSP,
bisulfite genomic sequencing, and NGS, all of which generate
complex datasets reflecting the complexity of neoplastic evolution
in human tissues. We also tested urine samples using methods
that optimize DNA isolation to enrich for cell-free fragmented
DNA that is excreted in the urine, which opens a novel approach to
early detection.
We are the first to show that a panel of host and viral DNA
methylation markers can discriminate between CIN2þ and
NILM in multiple body compartments from the same indi-
vidual: cervical cytology, serum, and urine. Our results suggest
that a precision medicine panel can be used as a reflex test in
cervical cytology to triage women referred to colposcopy. NGS
reads from urine ccfDNA can be aligned in custom cloud-

 based servers for life-course personalized cervical cancer
screening.
Women with low probability of having a CIN2þ lesion can be
triaged out of a biopsy after colposcopy. The 4-gene classifier best
performed in liquid-prep with sensitivity of 90.9%, specificity of
60.9%, and NPV (93.3%). In urine ccfDNA, the 4-gene classifier
had equal NPV (93.8%), a better specificity (83.3%), and similar
AUC (0.861). The results obtained for this classifier in cervical
cytology and urine ccfDNA warrant further study of this panel as a
molecular biomarker to triage women referred to colposcopy after
testing positive for hrHPV and being diagnosed with cervical
dysplasia with cytology. Women with low methylation values in
this panel would be asked to return for follow-up cytology and
HPV co-testing in 6 to 12 months, if the colposcopists do not see a
clear indication of a lesion that should be biopsied. This would
decrease the number of blind biopsies that are currently being
performed, decreasing screening costs and increasing health care
quality.
There is growing evidence that circulating short human, viral,
and bacterial DNA fragments from dying cells throughout the
body, approximately 150 to 250 bases long on average, pass
through the renal barrier and can be isolated as ccfDNA in urine.
These fragments are known as transrenal DNA (TrDNA) (47–49).
Recently, a capillary electrophoresis TrDNA test that targets the E1
region of the HPV genome for the detection of hrHPV demon-
strated high sensitivity and modest specificity for urine-based
detection of cervical precancerous lesions (50).
Urine samples tested by the TrDNA HPV capillary electropho-
resis test had high concordance with corresponding cervical and
urine samples tested by the widely used linear array HPV geno-
typing test (51). However, the TrDNA capillary electrophoresis
HPV test is not quantitative, can only detect the presence or
absence of hrHPV and, similar to previously published urine-
based HPV tests, has limited specificity. None of the hrHPV urine-
based reports use sequencing-based approaches to quantify mul-
tiple HPV types, nor include methylated markers in their work-
flow to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the TrDNA test.
We quantified hrHPV and the hrHPV methylome in urine
ccfDNA using custom sequence capture, which allow for multi-
plexed massively parallel sequencing of clinical samples and
qPCR verification. Our results also show that qMSP quantification
of HPV16-L1 methylation is a surrogate of genome-wide HPV16-
L1 methylation. Furthermore, urine ccfDNA assays discriminate
women with CIN2þ lesions when compared with women who do
not have cervical intraepithelial lesions or malignancy, which
could lead to high-throughput testing of urine ccfDNA by qPCR,
digital PCR, or multiplexed massively parallel sequencing.
Although privacy, cultural, and infrastructure issues challenge
the implementation of HPV testing for cervical cancer screening,
several countries have already implemented HPV testing in their
screening protocols. Co-testing with cytology and HPV at 5-year
intervals is now the preferred or acceptable strategy for cervical
cancer screening for women aged 30 to 64 years in the United
States. The Netherlands is implementing this year landmark
changes in the cervical cancer screening algorithms. Clinical
management for HPV-positive/Pap-negative women, however, is
not firmly established among practicing physicians. There is
resistance from the some in the medical community to accept
HPV-PAP co-testing for cervical cancer, due to the complex risk
patterns associated to positive, negative, and undetermined cytol-
ogy, with positive and negative HPV results.
Clinical detection of HPV is typically performed by in vitro
diagnostic assays that detect viral gDNA or RNA on the same
cervical mucosa samples collected for the cervical cytology test.
However, because HPV infections are very common and because
most women will clear HPV infections within 6 to 12 months, the
presence of hrHPV DNA does not mean that cervical dysplasia or
cervical cancer is present or that the infection will persist and the
patient will progress to cervical cancer (12). Furthermore, cervical
cancer screening programs currently in use are inefficient at
identifying individuals at risk for disease, requiring multiple visits
over a women's lifetime, which is costly and cumbersome (52).
New methods for cervical cancer screening and triage, which
provide accurate, efficient and cost-effective ways of identifying
women at risk for cervical cancer, will improve screening and
treatment efforts worldwide.
The primary aim of Phase II Biomarker Development Trials is to
estimate sensitivity, specificity, and/or receiver operator charac-
teristics (ROC) curves for the clinical biomarker assay and not to
report the data as percent agreement in 2 � 2 format (marker � by
CIN2þ/<CIN2; ref. 46). ROC curves have 2 main advantages over
frequencies and summary statistics for biomarker data: (i) ROC

 curves do not depend on the scale of raw data measurements,
which greatly facilitates comparison of the discriminatory capac-
ities of different biomarkers; and (ii) ROC curves display true- and
false-positive rates, quantities that are more relevant for screening
purposes than the raw biomarker values themselves.
This Phase II Biomarker Development Trial has some limita-
tions. The 4-gene panel assay provides acceptable discrimination
in liquid cytology samples when excluding patients with CIN1
lesions (75% sensitivity and 93.8% NPV) and in urine (75%
sensitivity and 93.8% NPV). These results suggest that more work
is needed to improve the performance of the biomarkers and
move this technology forward, before we are ready to perform a
Phase III Biomarker Development Trial in urine. To improve this
performance, we are redesigning our primers to shorten our
amplicons and increase the number of CpGs queried in our
primers and probes. We will also develop new primers to query
a larger region of the promoter of ZNF516, FKBP6, and INTS1,
with overlapping primers and probes. In addition, we can query
other regions of the HPV16-L1 gene, as well as design primers for
other HPV16 genes and for HPV18, HPV33, and HPV51 genes.
Moving forward, we will design personalized screening assays,
on the basis of resequencing the human and the HPV methy-
lomes, to customize precision screening markers applicable to
population subsets and individual patients, as we move forward
with the creation of personalized medicine tools for screening,
early detection, diagnosis, and cancer prevention.
In sum, our results reveal that patients harbor differentially
methylated loci in multiple HPV genotypes and host genes, which
can be identified with PCR and NGS technologies in cervical
cytology and urine ccfDNA. Because they are bound to change
overtime, these molecular panels can be used to personalize
cervical cancer screening algorithms that complement co-testing
with hrHPV tests, cervical cytology, and colposcopy. The devel-
opment of custom urine ccfDNA assays can lead to a new
generation of personalized cervical cancer screening algorithms,
which can be tracked using cloud-based technologies.
