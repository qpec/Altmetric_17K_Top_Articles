Remotely controlled, localized drug delivery is highly desirable for
potentially minimizing the systemic toxicity induced by the admin-
istration of typically hydrophobic chemotherapy drugs by conven-
tional means. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems provide a
highly promising approach for localized drug delivery, and are an
emerging field of interest in cancer treatment. Here, we demon-
strate near-IR light-triggered release of two drug molecules from
both DNA-based and protein-based hosts that have been conju-
gated to near-infrared-absorbing Au nanoshells (SiO2 core, Au shell),
each forming a light-responsive drug delivery complex. We show
that, depending upon the drug molecule, the type of host molecule,
and the laser illumination method (continuous wave or pulsed la-
ser), in vitro light-triggered release can be achieved with both types
of nanoparticle-based complexes. Two breast cancer drugs, doce-
taxel and HER2-targeted lapatinib, were delivered to MDA-MB-
231 and SKBR3 (overexpressing HER2) breast cancer cells and
compared with release in noncancerous RAW 264.7 macrophage
cells. Continuous wave laser-induced release of docetaxel from a
nanoshell-based DNA host complex showed increased cell death,
which also coincided with nonspecific cell death from photothermal
heating. Using a femtosecond pulsed laser, lapatinib release from
a nanoshell-based human serum albumin protein host complex
resulted in increased cancerous cell death while noncancerous con-
trol cells were unaffected. Both methods provide spatially and
temporally localized drug-release strategies that can facilitate high
local concentrations of chemotherapy drugs deliverable at a specific
treatment site over a specific time window, with the potential for
greatly minimized side effects.

reast cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths among
women worldwide, accounting for 1.7 million new diagnoses
in 2012 (1). Current treatments for breast cancer include a
combination of surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, molecularly
targeted, and antihormonal therapeutics (2, 3). One promising
approach in cancer treatment is the use of gold-based nano-
structures, whose strong optical absorption is due to their plasmon
resonance, to provide safe and effective light-based therapeutics.
Plasmonic nanostructures are advantageous due to their unique
optical properties, low toxicity, in vivo stability, and enhanced
tumor uptake (4–10). One approach uses near-infrared (IR) light
to heat silica core-gold shell nanoshells (NS) photothermally to
locally ablate tumors, which has been shown to lead to tumor
remission in mice at rates above 90% (11–13). In another ap-
proach, near-IR light is used to selectively release oligonucleotides
and molecules from the nanoparticle surface for gene therapy and
drug delivery (14–17). This latter approach also has highly
promising potential for cancer therapy, where high local concen-
trations of drugs could be released remotely, on demand, in a
spatially localized region such as the site of a tumor or metastatic
disease, while the overall systemic dosage to a patient would re-
main relatively low. This approach could unleash the potential of
known highly effective drugs that could otherwise induce toxicity
at high systemic doses.
A wide range of host molecules have been developed to pro-
vide specific binding of therapeutic molecules for nanoparticle-
based drug delivery (18–21). DNA and proteins are of particular
interest, since they can be readily conjugated for attachment to
gold nanoparticle surfaces, and their structures can be tailored
for uptake of drug molecules in a host–guest manner (22–24).
Host-conjugated nanoparticles can provide efficient internali-
zation into cells and provoke less of an immune response than
free drug molecules (25–29). For remotely triggered drug de-
livery, equally important is the nanoparticle’s light-induced drug-
release mechanism. Recently we have shown that continuous-wave
(CW)-induced light-triggered release requires the bulk tempera-
ture of the illuminated nanoparticle to rise above the thiolated
dsDNA dehybridization temperature to release ssDNA, while light-
induced release using femtosecond near-IR laser pulses breaks the
Au–S bond that binds the DNA to the nanoparticle with no
measurable bulk temperature increase (30).
Here we investigate near-IR light-triggered release of thera-
peutic molecules using two potential host molecules, thiolated
dsDNA and the protein human serum albumin (HSA), conjugated
onto Au NS to form two optically addressable drug delivery com-
plexes, NS@DNA and NS@HSA, respectively. These complexes
play host to two FDA-approved breast cancer drugs: docetaxel
(DTX) and lapatinib (LAP) molecules. DTX is an antimitotic chemo-
therapy drug that binds to the inside of microtubules preventing
Significance
Gold-based nanoparticles that absorb near-infrared light have
shown the potential to selectively target and treat cancer
through highly efficient light-to-heat conversion. This study
shows that gold-based nanoparticles can be coated with drug-
bearing host biomolecules for remotely triggerable release.
Near-infrared light-triggered release of docetaxel from a nanoshell-
based DNA host complex, and lapatinib from nanoshell-based
DNA and human serum albumin host complexes, is demon-
strated. There is a strong dependence upon the type of near-
infrared illumination––continuous wave or pulsed––specific to
the drug-laden host molecules. Localizing drug delivery both
spatially and temporally by combining nanoshell-based com-
plexes and pulsed-laser irradiation is a promising strategy for
highly controlled drug delivery that can apply to a myriad of
therapeutic applications.

 their disassembly, which disrupts cell division (31). LAP is a ty-
rosine kinase inhibitor that works by binding to the intracellular
ATP binding site of the tyrosine kinase domain of HER2
blocking phosphorylation (32). Growth factor receptors, such
as HER2, are proteins on the cell surface that signal it to grow
and divide: LAP acts to block the HER2 protein, overexpressed on
some forms of breast cancer, from signaling cell growth (33). Near-
IR light-induced intracellular release was performed in MDA-MB-
231 and SKBR3 (overexpresses HER2) breast cancer cells and
compared with release in noncancerous RAW 264.7 macrophage
cells. Macrophages were used as the control cells, as they have
been shown to be able to phagocytose nanoparticles and deliver
them to metastatic tumors where photothermal therapy can be
applied (34, 35). Future studies would involve macrophages de-
livering these particles for targeted in vivo drug release. Cellular
cytotoxicity was compared when drugs were released from the
NS@DNA and the NS@HSA complexes. Two methods for near-
IR light-triggered release, CW laser light at 1.5 W incident power
and pulsed-laser irradiation, where 160-fs near-IR laser pulses at
25 mW average power were used. Our study shows that NS@DNA
host complexes release their drug payload using CW laser light,
while NS@HSA complexes can be triggered to release their drug
payload using femtosecond near-IR laser illumination. Both com-
plexes exhibit the potential for highly controlled drug release at the
site of disease and within a narrow time window, unlike conven-
tional chemotherapy. Such strategies could be used to increase the
efficacy of chemotherapeutic treatment while lowering overall
systemic dosages, reducing deleterious side effects.
Results and Discussion
Nanocomplex Synthesis and Characterization. Schematic represen-
tations of nanocomplex fabrication and the light-triggered drug-
release process using two host biomolecules bound to Au NSs
are shown in Scheme 1. To form the NS@DNA@drug nano-
complexes, dsDNA is first attached to NS through Au–thiol
bonds. The DNA sequence selected for DTX (DNA1: 5′-HS-
C6H12-GGA ATA CAC GCG CGA AAT CAC G-3′) is a vari-
ation of Dickerson’s dodecamer, d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2, which
has previously been shown to complex taxol and other analogs
(36). The base substitutions were made to result in the dsDNA
structure having a higher melting point than any hairpin struc-
tures, which allows for preferential formation of the DNA duplex
upon DNA cooling in the hybridization process. An adenine–
thymine-rich sequence was chosen for LAP (DNA2 = 5′-HS-
C6H12-AAA AAA ATA TAT AAT TAA AAG TTG AAA-3′).
LAP’s structure contains a pyrimidinamine, analagous to adenine,
and is thus expected to bind to thymine in a similar manner (37). The
NS@DNA@drug nanocomplexes are incubated with cells, then il-
luminated with a near-IR laser. The laser wavelength was selected to
match the NS plasmon resonance in the near-IR spectral water
window (38). To maximize drug-release efficiency, two illumination
sources were investigated: CW laser irradiation and femtosecond
pulsed-laser irradiation. CW illumination results in dehybridization of
the DNA and release of the drug, while pulsed irradiation results in
Au–S bond breakage and release of the dsDNA–drug complex.
HSA is the most abundant protein in blood plasma and can
bind highly insoluble drug molecules in its hydrophobic pockets
(39–41). Due to its large size and multiple binding regions, HSA
has the potential to significantly increase the payload capacity of
the nanocomplexes. NS are coated with HSA, which forms a
protein corona around the particles, which are subsequently in-
cubated with drug molecules (Scheme 1B). The NS@HSA@drug
nanocomplexes are subsequently incubated with cells and irradiated
with either a CW or pulsed near-IR laser in the same manner as the
NS@DNA@drug nanocomplexes.
Functionalization of the NS surfaces was verified with
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), extinction spectros-
copy, zeta potential, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Fig.
1). The TEM images of unconjugated NS (orange) showed
spherical particles with smooth regular surfaces, while TEM im-
ages of NS@DNA1 and NS@DNA2 (blue) showed the formation
of a thin dsDNA layer around the NS (Fig. 1A). TEM images of
NS@DNA1@DTX and NS@DNA2@LAP (green) showed no
morphological changes (zoomed-in TEM images of the NS sur-
face are seen in SI Appendix, Fig. S1). In the case of NS@HSA

 and NS@HSA@LAP (Fig. 1A), a hard and a soft corona around
the NS can be observed in the TEM images of the complexes. The
extinction maxima red-shift when coated with dsDNA and further
red-shift when the drug molecules are loaded due to the changes
in the dielectric environment around the NS (Fig. 1B). Protein
coating induces a larger red-shift relative to dsDNA as a result of
the larger size of the adsorbed protein layer. No changes in the
peak shape or width of the extinction spectrum is observed, in-
dicating that the nanocomplexes do not aggregate during the
functionalization process. Zeta-potential measurements further
confirm modification of the NS surface. For example, the zeta
potential became more negative after dsDNA attachment and
even more negative with drug loading (Fig. 1B). DLS measure-
ments show the hydrodynamic diameter of bare NS decreases
after DNA functionalization, possibly due to a change in the
solvent from water to TE buffer. The hydrodynamic diameter
further decreases after drug loading, likely as a result of com-
paction of the DNA (42). In the case of protein functionaliza-
tion, the hydrodynamic diameter increases slightly after protein
coating and shows minimal change upon drug loading.
Confirmation of Drug Loading. Surface-enhanced Raman spec-
troscopy (SERS) was used to confirm drug loading of the NS@host
complexes (Fig. 2). The SERS spectrum of the thiolated
dsDNA1 monolayer on the NS surface shows several characteristic
SERS bands at 1,346 and 1,480 cm−1 (43). The SERS mode at
737 cm−1 is weak due to the low number of adenine bases in the
DNA sequence (44) (Fig. 2A). Moreover, several strong SERS
peaks at 1,003, 1,271, 1,520, and 1,543 cm−1 assigned to the ben-
zene ring modes (νC-C, νC-O, νC = C, and ring stretching) are
seen in the NS@DNA1@DTX SERS spectrum (45, 46). This in-
dicates the DNA1–DTX complex formation. The bands at 1,340
and 1,475 cm−1 are enhanced in the complex spectrum in com-
parison with DNA1. In the case of the NS@DNA2 monolayer on
the NS surface, the SERS spectrum is dominated by the adenine
ring-breathing mode at 737 cm−1 (Fig. 2B). LAP Raman peaks
including C-O-C mode of a substituted furan at 1,136 cm−1 are
seen in the NS@DNA2@LAP SERS spectra. The protein–drug
nanocomplex SERS data confirm that LAP has associated with the
HSA protein corona on the particle surface from spectral features
that include a quinazoline ring stretch at 1,369 cm−1 (Fig. 2C).
The observed SERS frequencies and their assignments of DNA1,
DNA2, and NS@DNA1@DTX, NS@DNA2@LAP complexes
are listed in SI Appendix, Table S1.
Additional confirmation of LAP loading onto NS@DNA2
was performed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (SI
Appendix, Fig. S2). A survey scan shows Au 4p3, 4d3, 4d5, 4f5,
and 4f7 from the Au layer of the NS. Si 2s and 2p peaks, as well
as O 1s peaks, originate from the SiO2 core of the NS. The C 1s

 peak comes from the DNA. An elemental scan of the S 2p
feature reveals a peak at a binding energy of 168 eV, indicating
the presence of S in a sulfone group as opposed to a thiol, which
further confirms LAP loading onto the DNA host.
Nanocomplex Cellular Uptake. Cellular uptake of the NS@host@drug
complexes was investigated using dark-field, confocal, and re-
flectance (emission and extinction at 640 nm) microscopy in
RAW 264.7 macrophage cells, and in MDA-MB-231-eGFP and
SKBR3 breast cancer cells. For simplicity, only the RAW 264.7 im-
ages are shown (Fig. 3). In the dark-field images, internalization of
the nanocomplexes can easily be seen as time-dependent, diffraction-
limited bright spots (Fig. 3 B and C). As a control, cells not incubated
with nanoparticles showed no observable bright spots (Fig. 3A).
Because the dark-field images alone do not give clear evidence
whether the NS@HSA@drug are adsorbed onto the outer mem-
brane of the cells or internalized, bright-field images were also
obtained. Varying the depth of field within an individual cell allows
for clear 3D visualization of the nanocomplex distribution within
the cell. Fig. 3E is a slice from the middle of the cell showing clear
diffraction-limited dark spots corresponding to the nanocomplexes,
verifying that the NS complexes are internalized within the cell. As
a control, cells not incubated with the nanocomplexes showed no
observable dark spots when imaged in the same mode (Fig. 3D).
To further investigate the nanocomplex cellular uptake and local-
ization inside the cells, confocal images were measured in trans-
mission and reflection mode (emission and extinction at 640 nm) at
varying depths. The details in the orthogonal YZ and XZ planes
illustrate the location of the nanoparticles within the cell boundary
around but not inside the nucleus [the nucleus was stained with
Hoechst 33342 dye (Fig. 3F)]. We have previously shown that NS
phagocytosed by macrophages are dispersed within vacuoles (34).
TEM of a macrophage in the necrotic area of a breast tumor shows
NS within a vacuole that is likely an endosome/lysosome (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S3).
Intracellular Light-Triggered Drug-Release Studies. Cellular cyto-
toxicity resulting from light-triggered release of DTX and LAP
was evaluated using both the dsDNA and protein host adsorbates.
Cells were grown for 24 h in 96-well plates, incubated for 4 h with
nanocomplexes, washed with PBS, then given fresh media. Cells
were irradiated with 1.5 W of CW laser power or a Ti:Sa laser
amplifier (Coherent, RegA) operating at 250 kHz with an average
power of 25 mW and 160-fs pulsed-laser power for 2 min, then
incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h to allow time for the released
drug molecules to interact with the cells. Cell death was evaluated
with a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assay. Percent
cytotoxicity values were calculated considering 10% cell death in
the control experiment, NS@host with no laser treatment.
DTX release from the DNA1 host was investigated in MDA-
MB-231 breast cancer cells (Fig. 4A) and in RAW 264.7 macro-
phage cells (Fig. 4B). The NS@DNA1@DTX nanocomplex is
shown to be nontoxic, since statistically no increase in cytotox-
icity was observed compared with the NS@DNA1 nanoparticles.
This indicates that DTX stays confined within the DNA host and
that no leaching occurs. A very statistically significant (P < 0.01)
increase in cytotoxicity for the cells with NS@DNA1 after CW

 laser treatment (no DTX) is likely due to photothermal ablation.
A statistically significant (P < 0.05) increase in cell death is ob-
served under CW laser irradiation between no DTX and DTX,
confirming there is a positive effect of drug release beyond any
photothermal heating caused by the laser. A very statistically
significant (P < 0.01) increase in cell death is seen when DTX is
released with the CW laser compared with NS@DNA1@DTX
with no laser, while no increased cell death is seen for pulsed-
laser-induced release. This is most likely due to the different
DNA release mechanisms resulting from CW vs. pulsed lasers
(30). In the case of a CW laser, the nanocomplex and its sur-
rounding local environment undergo a photothermal tempera-
ture increase, causing the dsDNA to dehybridize, releasing the
drug and ssDNA. Similar results are seen for both the cancer and
macrophage cells, which are to be expected, since DTX is not a
targeted cancer drug and does not discriminate between can-
cerous and healthy cells. There is an extremely statistically sig-
nificant (P < 0.001) increase in cytotoxicity for NS@DNA1@DTX
without and with CW laser. In contrast, irradiation with a pulsed
laser induces breakage of the Au–S anchoring bond of the
dsDNA. As a result, the entire dsDNA–drug complex is re-
leased, with the drug likely remaining sequestered within the
DNA: this should restrict DTX from inducing cell death upon
irradiation.
In principle, pulsed-laser-induced drug release is preferable
over CW laser-induced drug release, since far lower average
powers can be used, minimizing photothermal heating effects
that would include nonspecific cell death. Since pulsed-laser-
induced drug release from the NS@DNA host releases the en-
tire dsDNA–drug complex, NS@HSA was investigated as an
alternative drug host. LAP was released from both an NS@DNA
and NS@HSA host in SKBR3 breast cancer cells and RAW
264.7 macrophage cells. LAP was chosen to see if cell death
could be preferentially induced in cancer cells over healthy cells,
since LAP specifically targets the HER2 receptor that is over-
expressed on SKBR3 cells. For the NS@DNA host, no statisti-
cally significant increase in cytotoxicity is observed for either CW
or pulsed-laser-induced release for SKBR3 cells (Fig. 5A). There
is also no increase in cytotoxicity for CW laser-induced release
from the protein scaffold; however, there is a very statistically
significant (P < 0.01) increase in cytotoxicity for pulsed-laser-
induced LAP release from the NS@HSA host in SKBR3 cells
(Fig. 5B). The low average power (25 mW) does not increase the
local temperature and therefore cells with NS@HSA alone do
not show increased death after pulsed-laser treatment. However,
pulsed-laser irradiation is clearly sufficient to alter the HSA,
releasing LAP from the NS@HSA@LAP nanocomplex, shown
by the extremely statistically significant (P < 0.001) increase in
cytotoxicity vs. pulsed irradiation of NS@HSA without LAP.
The extent to which the NS-bound HSA is unfolded or dena-
tured by femtosecond laser irradiation is unclear, and may be the
subject of future studies.
LAP release was performed in the noncancerous macrophage
cells as a control (Fig. 5C). Since macrophages lack the HER2
receptor, LAP release is not expected to induce cytotoxicity. There
is a very statistically significant (P < 0.01) increase in cell death for
NS@HSA with laser vs. no laser. This is likely due to photothermal
heating. No selective increase in cytotoxicity for CW or pulsed-laser
LAP release from the NS@HSA host was observed. The lack of
increased cytotoxicity after LAP release from the NS@HSA host
with a pulsed laser confirms that the laser treatment did not directly
induce the cell death seen with the LAP release from the NS@HSA
host for SKBR3 cells. This suggests that the released LAP can se-
lectively induce cell death in HER2 expressing breast cancer cells,
without affecting noncancerous cells.
Conclusion
Both CW and pulsed near-IR light have been shown to induce
in vitro release of drug molecules from NS@DNA and NS@HSA
complexes. DTX and targeted LAP, two commonly used breast
cancer drugs, were released in both cancerous and noncancerous
cells. The results demonstrate that there is a higher percent cy-
totoxicity for CW vs. pulsed-laser-induced DTX release from a
DNA host; however, some nonspecific cell death is induced by the
CW laser itself. Using the protein scaffold, increased cytotoxicity
was observed for LAP release using pulsed vs. CW light in can-
cerous cells, while noncancerous cells were unaffected. These re-
sults show that light-triggered drug release could be a very
promising method for delivering chemotherapy drugs in cancer
treatment. By simply exchanging the chemotherapy drug, this
system can be extended to treatments for many cancer types. The
flexible loading and release strategies shown here will allow re-
lease to be more easily controlled and tailored for various che-
motherapeutic drugs and cancer types. This in turn has the
potential for increasing therapeutic efficacy by delivering high
local drug concentrations while keeping systemic drug concen-
trations low, which would reduce the well-known deleterious side
effects of conventional chemotherapeutic drug delivery methods.
The hosting of LAP within HSA deserves specific comment. Ty-
rosine kinase inhibitors are notoriously insoluble in water, which is
one of the reasons why this class of drug has poor oral bio-
availability (47). Additionally, although clinical trials have dem-
onstrated that the combination of LAP with other HER2 directed
therapies for dual blockade is of benefit in certain subgroups of
patients (48), severe toxicities, diarrhea in particular, are leading
to poor compliance and treatment discontinuation (49). The
NS@HSA@LAP formulation has the potential to deliver an ef-
ficacious dose of a poorly soluble drug directly to the tumor where
it can be released. As it will be released only at the tumor, theo-
retically the systemic dose will be less than with current oral for-
mulations resulting in less toxicity, more compliance, and greater
disease control.
