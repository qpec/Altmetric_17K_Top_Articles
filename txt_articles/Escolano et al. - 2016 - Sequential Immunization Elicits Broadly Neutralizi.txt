Summary
A vaccine that elicits broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV-1 is likely to be 
protective, but this has not been achieved. To explore immunization regimens that might elicit 
bNAbs, we produced and immunized mice expressing the predicted germline of PGT121, a bNAb 
specific for the V3-loop and surrounding glycans on the HIV-1 spike. Priming with an epitope 
modifiied immunogen designed to activate germline antibody-expressing B cells, followed by 
ELISA-guided boosting with a sequence of directional immunogens, native-like trimers with 
decreasing epitope modification, elicited heterologous tier-2 neutralizing responses. In contrast, 
repeated immunization with the priming immunogen did not. Antibody cloning confirmed 
elicitation of high levels of somatic mutation and tier-2 neutralizing antibodies resembling the 
authentic human bNAb. Our data establishes that sequential immunization with specifically

eTOC
Generation of HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies - a major goal in vaccine research - can be 
achieved through sequential immunization with HIV envelope glycoproteins designed to engage 
PGT121 antibody precursors and their intermediates.
Introduction
HIV-1 infected humans occasionally develop antibodies that are capable of broad and potent 
viral neutralization. Single cell antibody cloning methods revealed that this serologic activity 
is due to one or a combination of monoclonal antibodies that target several different epitopes 
on the HIV-1 spike protein gp160 (Scheid et al., 2009; Walker et al., 2009; West et al., 2014; 
Wu et al., 2010). When passively transferred into humanized mice or macaques, bNAbs 
protect against infection for prolonged periods of time (Gautam et al., 2016; Klein et al., 
2012; Mascola et al., 2000; Moldt et al., 2012; Shibata et al., 1999; Shingai et al., 2013) 
Therefore, it is generally accepted that a vaccine that elicits such antibodies would be 
protective (Pantaleo and Koup, 2004). However, after more than 25 years and innumerable 
pre-clinical studies and human vaccine trials, bNAbs have not been elicited by immunization 
(Burton et al., 2004; Cohen and Dolin, 2013; Schiffner et al., 2013).
In addition to uncovering new sites of vulnerability on the HIV-1 spike, antibody cloning 
revealed several unusual features of anti-HIV-1 antibodies. These include long 
complementarity determining region 3s (CDR3s), a higher than expected propensity to 
polyreactivity, and an unusually high level of somatic hypermutation (SHM) (Dimitrov, 
2010; Kwong et al., 2013; Mascola and Haynes, 2013; Scheid et al., 2009; West et al., 
2014). Irrespective of their targets on the HIV-1 spike, the high level of somatic

 hypermutation is the most conserved amongst these unusual features of bNAbs. Moreover, 
mutation is essential for bNAb activity (Bonsignori et al., 2011; Klein et al., 2013a; 
Mouquet et al., 2012; Mouquet et al., 2010; Scheid et al., 2011; Sok et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 
2010) and within longitudinal antibody lineages, the level of somatic mutation is directly 
correlated with antibody activity (Bhiman et al., 2015; Doria-Rose et al., 2014; Klein et al., 
2013a; Liao et al., 2013; Sok et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2011).
Hypermutation occurs in germinal centers where B-lymphocytes undergo clonal expansion 
and affinity based selection in response to antigen (Victora and Nussenzweig, 2012). Under 
normal circumstances, the germinal center reaction is limited by antigen availability and by 
an antibody affinity ceiling (Baumjohann et al., 2013; Foote and Eisen, 1995; Goodnow et 
al., 2010). However, longitudinal studies of HIV-1 antibody evolution have shown that 
HIV-1 can escape immune pressure by mutation and selection, resulting in a continually 
evolving antigen that produces a persistent immune response to a highly variable infection 
(Bhiman et al., 2015; Doria-Rose et al., 2014; Kwong et al., 2002; Liao et al., 2013; Stewart-
Jones et al., 2016). Consistent with this notion, prospective studies of HIV-1 infected 
humans that develop bNAbs revealed interdependence between changes in viral and the 
antibody sequences (Bhiman et al., 2015; Doria-Rose et al., 2014; Liao et al., 2013; 
Richman et al., 2003; Wei et al., 2003). Thus, as initially proposed (Scheid et al., 2009), the 
high levels of somatic mutation found in bNAbs are most consistent with continuing parallel 
evolution of the virus and the antibody response (Klein et al., 2013a; Klein et al., 2013b; 
Mouquet et al., 2012; Mouquet et al., 2010; Scheid et al., 2009).
PGT121 and related antibodies target a region of the HIV-1 spike that is heavily 
glycosylated (Kong et al., 2013). Their target epitopes are comprised of the GlyAspIleArg 
(GDIR) sequence at the base of the V3 loop, and surrounding glycans at positions Asn332, 
Asn156, Asn301, and Asn137 (N332, N156, N301, N137) (Garces et al., 2015; Garces et al., 
2014; Julien et al., 2013; Mouquet et al., 2012; Sok et al., 2014; Walker et al., 2011; Walker 
et al., 2009). These antibodies are commonly found in individuals that develop bNAbs 
during natural infection (Mouquet et al., 2012; Walker et al., 2011; Walker et al., 2010). In 
addition, they are also amongst the most potent bNAbs discovered to date (Kwong et al., 
2013).
PGT121 antibodies show high levels of somatic mutations and arise from a singular 
precursor that diverges into two distinct families, exemplified by PGT121 (Walker et al., 
2011) and 10-1074 or PGT124 (Mouquet et al., 2012; Sok et al., 2013). Somatic mutations 
differentiate the PGT121 lineage that recognizes glycans at N301, N137, and N156 from the 
10-1074 or PGT124 lineage that is highly dependent on N332 but less so on the other 
glycans surrounding the base of the V3 loop (Garces et al., 2015; Garces et al., 2014; 
Mouquet et al., 2012; Sok et al., 2014; Sok et al., 2013). Finally, like other bNAbs, the 
inferred germline precursor of PGT121 antibodies shows no appreciable affinity for all 
HIV-1 Env antigens tested, and no neutralizing activity (Andrabi et al., 2015; Doria-Rose et 
al., 2014; Gorman et al., 2016; Klein et al., 2013a; Liao et al., 2013; Mouquet et al., 2012; 
Sok et al., 2013).

 Based on the requirements for unusually high levels of somatic mutation in bNAbs, and the 
inability of germline reverted antibodies to bind to native-like antigens, it was proposed that 
a vaccine to elicit these antibodies would necessitate a new paradigm involving a germline 
prime followed by sequential immunization with different antigens (Dimitrov, 2010; Haynes 
et al., 2012; Jardine et al., 2013; Klein et al., 2013a; Klein et al., 2013b; McGuire et al., 
2013; Mouquet et al., 2012; Pancera et al., 2010; Scheid et al., 2009; Scheid et al., 2011; 
Zhou et al., 2010). To test this idea, we have sequentially immunized mice that carry the 
germline reverted version of the PGT121 family precursor with a series of specifically 
engineered antigens (Steichen et al., 2016 submitted).
Results
PGT121 Mice
Mice carrying the Ig V(D)Js encoding the inferred germline or fully mature IgH, and the 
predicted germline IgL of PGT121 (GLH121, MutH121, and GLL121 respectively) were 
produced by gene targeting Albino B6 (B6 (Cg)-Tyrc-2J/J) embryonic stem cells (Figure 
S1A)(Pelanda et al., 1997; Shih et al., 2002). The GL121 sequence contains germline V, D 
and J genes, and the naturally occurring CDRH3 sequence corresponding to the least 
mutated antibodies in this lineage (Kepler, 2013; Mouquet et al., 2012). Mice carrying 
GLH121 and MutH121 were bred with GLL121 to produce GLHL121 and MutHGLL121 
mice (Mouquet et al., 2012). MutHGLL121 represents a synthetic intermediate of the 
PGT121 antibody wherein the IgH is fully mature. Nevertheless, induction of IgL 
maturation by immunization is ambitious because many of the essential contacts between 
PGT121 and the HIV-1 spike are dependent on IgL somatic mutations.
GLHL121 and MutHGLL121 mice showed normal numbers of splenocytes and near normal 
frequencies of marginal zone and follicular B cells in the spleen as measured by flow 
cytometry (Figure S1B,C). To examine the antibody repertoire expressed by naïve B cells in 
GLHL121 and MutHGLL121 mice, we purified single B cells by cell sorting and cloned their 
expressed IgVH and IgVL from cDNA (Dosenovic et al., 2015); von Boehmer et al, in 
press). In both genotypes the antibodies were composed exclusively of products of the 
knocked-in antibody genes (Figure S1D). We conclude that the majority of the B cells in 
GLHL121 and MutHGLL121 mice express the respective knock-in gene and develop 
normally.
Activation of GLHL121 B cells in vivo
Germline reverted PGT121 does not bind to native-like Env antigens and shows no 
neutralizing activity for all HIV-1 isolates tested (Klein et al., 2013a; Mouquet et al., 2012; 
Sok et al., 2013). Consistent with this observation, the serum of naïve GLHL121 and 
MutHGLL121 mice did not bind to the native-like Env protein BG505 SOSIP in ELISA 
(Figure S2A,B). Moreover, repeated immunization with native-like Env proteins YU2 
SOSIP, BG505 SOSIP, or other Env-based immunogens such as BG505-5MUT and 
BG505-3MUT (5- and 3-MUT respectively (Steichen et al., submitted)) failed to elicit 
antibody responses in GLHL121 mice (Figure S2A,B). These results are in agreement with 
the observation that native-like Env immunogens failed to induce immune responses in

 knock-in mice that carry the inferred germline heavy chains of 3BNC60 or VRC01, and with 
the idea that activating germline bNAb expressing B cells requires specifically engineered 
antigens (Dosenovic et al., 2015; Hoot et al., 2013; Jardine et al., 2013; Jardine et al., 2016; 
Jardine et al., 2015; McGuire et al., 2013; Mouquet et al., 2010; Scheid et al., 2009; Xiao et 
al., 2009).
To attempt to activate B cells that carry PGT121 antibody precursors, we immunized 
GLHL121 and MutHGLL121 mice with BG505-10MUT (10MUT), a BG505 variant that was 
specifically engineered to bind to germline reverted PGT121 antibodies (Steichen et al., 
2016). 10MUT binds to MutHGLL with a Kd =47000nM whereas it has no measurable 
affinity to GLHL121 (Figure S2C) by surface plasmon resonance. Despite the lack of 
measurable affinity to GLHL121, a single immunization with 10MUT trimer, but not the 
corresponding monomer, elicited antibody responses in both GLHL121 and MutHGLL121 
mice as measured by ELISA (Figure 1A). Moreover, the antibodies induced by 
immunization of both types of mice specifically targeted the PGT121 epitope on Env, 
because binding to 10MUT was eliminated by mutation at positions N332, N301 and 
H330A (10MUT KO) (Figure 1A, and B). Despite the specificity of the response, 
immunization with 10MUT did not elicit neutralizing activity (Figure S2D.). We conclude 
that an engineered Env based BG505 SOSIP immunogen, 10MUT, can initiate antibody 
responses in GLHL121 and MutHGLL121 mice but it does not elicit bNAbs.
Sequential immunization in GLHL121 and MutHGLL121 mice
To test whether a sequential immunization strategy can shepherd GLHL121 and 
MutHGLL121 antibodies to develop neutralizing activity, we immunized with a succession 
of Env-based immunogens that were developed as intermediates between 10MUT and 
native-like antigens and showed varying affinities (1–10 nM) for the mature PGT121 
antibody (Figure 1C,D) (Steichen et al., submitted). ELISA testing of mouse serum on these 
proteins after each immunization, and consideration of the directionality engineered into the 
immunogens, determined the sequence of boosting immunogens (Figure 1C,D). For 
example, we selected 7MUT for boosting after immunization with 10MUT because 7MUT 
was the least mutated immunogen that showed detectable binding to the serum of one of the 
immunized mice by ELISA (Figure 1D). Subsequent immunogens were selected in the same 
manner (Figure 1D).
Longitudinal ELISA testing of the serum from sequentially immunized mice revealed that 
antibody responses were boosted in response to each of the immunogens while remaining 
specific for the PGT121 epitope (Figure 1D, Figure 2A,B, Figure S2E,F and data not 
shown). After immunization with 5MUT, the serum of 1 GLHL121 and all 7 MutHGLL121 
mice showed binding to BG505 SOSIP in ELISAs (Figure 2B and data not shown), and 
though serum reactivity to 3MUT and 2MUT was also detected, immunization with either of 
those proteins at this stage would have violated directionality because both lack native 
PGT121-epitope glycans that are present in 5MUT and BG505 SOSIP (Steichen et al., 
2016). Thus the BG505 SOSIP was used as a boost after 5MUT and then followed by a 
cocktail of 5 native-like SOSIPs differing in their variable loops (Variable Loop Cocktail or 
VLC)(Steichen et al., submitted). After the final immunization, all but one of the GLHL121

 and all of the MutHGLL121 mice showed binding to the 5 native-like VLCs (Figure 2B and 
data not shown).
Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies
To determine whether sequential immunization elicited anti-HIV-1 bNAbs, purified serum 
antibodies from control, and immunized mice, were tested for neutralizing activity by TZM-
bl assay using a panel of 12 tier 2, and 2 tier 1B viruses (Figure 3A). Igs from naïve control 
mice showed no neutralizing activity. In contrast, 5/7 GLHL121 and all 7 of the 
MutHGLL121 mice showed cross clade neutralization against heterologous tier 2 isolates 
(Figure 3A). As expected, none of the purified serum Igs samples neutralized HIV-1R1166, 
which lacks the N332 N-linked glycosylation site that is critical for the binding and in vivo 
activity of PGT121 antibodies (Figure 3A)(Klein et al., 2013a; Klein et al., 2012; Mouquet 
et al., 2012; Walker et al., 2011).
To further evaluate the breadth of the serologic responses, purified Ig from one GLHL121 
and one MutHGLL121 mouse was assayed against a panel of 54 tier 2 and 2 tier 1B viruses. 
Whereas PGT121 neutralized 50 of these isolates, GLHL121 and MutHGLL121 Igs 
neutralized 12 and 23 tier 2 HIV-1 isolates respectively (Figure S3). Thus, the serum Igs 
isolated from sequentially immunized mice showed strong cross-clade tier 2 neutralizing 
activity, but less breadth than PGT121.
To determine when neutralization activity emerged, we assayed intermediate time points in 
the sequential immunization series. In both GLHL121 and MutHGLL121 mice, neutralization 
was first detected after immunization with 5MUT (Figure 3B). However, this activity was 
less broad and less potent than that found after the complete immunization series (Figure 
3A,B).
To determine whether repeated doses of a single antigen or a simplified protocol can also 
elicit bNAbs, we immunized repeatedly with the priming antigen 10MUT, or alternatively 
with 10MUT followed by BG505 separated by a period of time equivalent to the original 
sequential protocol. Analysis of the serum from the GLHL121 mice by ELISA showed no 
significant binding to native-like Env proteins (Figure S4A,B). Repeated immunization with 
10MUT elicited some weak neutralization activity in 3/6 MutHGLL121 mice and little or no 
detectable activity in any of the GLHL121 mice (Figure 3C). Similarly, 10MUT followed by 
BG5050 was entirely ineffective in GLHL121 mice and produced only weak neutralizing 
activity in 1/3 MutHGLL121 mice (Figure 3D). We conclude that repeated immunizations 
with 10MUT, or the combination of 10MUT and BG505 in absence of intermediate 
antigens, is far less effective than sequential immunization with different antigens.
To determine whether an abbreviated immunization protocol using some of the same 
antigens would also elicit bNAbs, we primed with 7MUT, and boosted with 5MUT, followed 
by wtBG505 and VLCs (Figure S4C). Analysis of the serum by ELISA revealed that this 
protocol was less effective in eliciting antibodies with binding affinity to native-like Env 
proteins (Figure S4C). Consistent with the ELISA data, the abbreviated protocol produced 
less potent neutralizing activity, and in only 1/3 GLHL121 and the 3 MutHGLL121 mice 
(Figure S4D). Similarly, priming with 11MUTA, a higher affinity variant of 10MUT

 followed by 5MUT, wtBG505, and VLCs elicited only weak ELISA activity against native-
like proteins and low levels of neutralizing antibodies in MutHGLL121 and none in 
GLHL121 mice (Figure S4E–F).
We conclude that sequential immunization guided by ELISA measurements is effective in 
inducing maturation of PGT121 germline antibodies to become bNAbs in Ig knock-in mice.
Antibody Sequences from sequentially immunized mice
To characterize the antibodies elicited by sequential immunization, we cloned them from 
purified single IgG+ memory B cells binding to a mixture of 3 different gp120 proteins but 
not to mutants of these proteins that do not bind to PGT121.
Sequential immunization with a series of related antigens induced remarkably high levels of 
somatic mutation in the IgL of the knock-in mice, reaching a maximum of 34 and 25 
nucleotide, or 21 and 18 amino acid mutations in GLHL121 and MutHGLL121 B cells 
respectively (Figure 4A,B,D and Figure S5A,B,D). In contrast, high levels of IgH mutation 
were only found in GLHL121 and not in pre-mutated 121 IgH in MutHGLL121 mice (Figure 
4C,E and Figure S5C,E). Thus, although the somatic mutation machinery was similarly 
active in the germinal center B cells of both knock-in mice, the MutH121 was less 
susceptible to additional mutation, possibly because some of the target sequences for 
activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID) had already been mutated (Figure S5F) 
(Dosenovic et al., 2015); (Pavri and Nussenzweig, 2011). Finally, despite the high level of 
mutation, we found no deletions or insertions in the IgH or IgL of either of the immunized 
mice (Kepler et al., 2014).
To determine whether induction of high levels of mutation requires sequential immunization 
we isolated single antigen specific IgG+ memory B cells from mice immunized repeatedly 
with 10MUT or 10MUT followed by wtBG505. Multiple immunizations with 10MUT, or 
10MUT followed by BG505 induced significantly lower levels of SHM at both the 
nucleotide and amino acid levels in GLHL121 and MutHGLL121 B cells than the sequential 
protocol (Figure 5A–F, Figure S5G,H,I). We conclude that repeated immunizations with one 
or two antigens fails to elicit the high levels of mutation found after sequential 
immunization.
Neutralization by monoclonal antibodies
Antibodies from immunized mice showed somatic mutations that were in some cases 
identical or similar to mutations in PGT121, PGT122, PGT123 or 10-1074 (PGT121-like). 
Indeed there was a direct correlation between the total number of amino acid mutations and 
the number of amino acid substitutions that were similar to those found in the bNAbs (r2= 
0.796, Fig. 6A and B). To further characterize individual antibodies we produced 77 
monoclonal antibodies (40 from GLHL121 and 37 from MutHGLL121 mice), and tested 
them for neutralization against a panel of 12 tier 2 and 2 tier 1B viruses (Figure 6C, Figure 7 
and Figure S6C). As a control we cloned 5 antibodies from GLHL121 mice and other 5 from 
MutHGLL121 mice immunized repeatedly with 10MUT (Figure 6, Figure 7 and Figure S6).

 Among the 40 and 37 antibodies cloned from GLHL121 and MutHGLL121 mice, 15 and 17 
respectively showed neutralizing activity against tier 2 HIV-1 isolates including antibodies 
Ab6 and Ab8 that were cloned from GLHL121 mouse M7 that had no detectable neutralizing 
activity in serum (Figures 3A and 6C). In contrast, none of the antibodies cloned from mice 
repeatedly immunized with 10MUT showed any neutralizing activity in TZM-bl assays 
(Figure 6 and Figure S6). Thus, the activity of the monoclonals generally reflected the 
neutralizing activity found in serum. However, bNAbs were also obtained from immunized 
mice with no detectable serologic activity (Figure 3 and 6).
Among the monoclonal antibodies tested, there was significant variation in neutralizing 
breadth and potency. As expected, the neutralizing activity of the monoclonal antibodies was 
directly related to their ability to bind to the native-like BG505 SOSIP protein in ELISA 
(Figure S6A,B) (Sanders et al., 2013). For example, antibodies Ab1, Ab2 and Ab3 showed 
high level binding in ELISA and neutralized 10 viral strains whereas antibodies Ab18 and 
Ab19 didn’t bind to BG505 and didn’t neutralize any of the strains in the panel (Figure 6 
and Figure S6B). However, the potency of the autologous response to the BG505 T332N 
pseudovirus was unexpectedly low. Although additional analysis of these responses is 
required, the results suggest some structural differences between the epitopes on the 
immunogen and the pseudovirus.
Neutralizing activity was directly related to the number of somatic mutations (r2= 0.708) 
(Figure 6A). A direct correlation between the number of mutations and the number of 
PGT121-like mutations was also observed when all the amplified heavy chain and light 
chain sequences from all the mice immunized with the different protocols were analyzed 
(r2= 0.902 for heavy chains; r2= 0.864 for light chains)(Figure 6B). The antibodies with the 
best neutralizing activity carried amino acid substitutions at positions in IgH that make a 
critical contribution to Env binding, for example S56N contributes to the interaction with the 
N137 glycan and D100iE resides near the GDIR motif. (Garces et al., 2014; Sok et al., 
2013). Moreover, CDRH3 residues found in the inferred germline that are also present in the 
mature PGT121 and involved in antigen-antibody interactions were retained (R103 and 
Y105 which make contacts with N332 glycan and the GDIR motif respectively). Similarly, 
the IgL in the neutralizing monoclonals showed amino acid substitutions at positions that 
contribute to the neutralizing activity of PGT121 (N25D, H33P, D50N (N332 glycan 
contact) and the S92, S93, S94 (GDIR recognition) (Mouquet et al., 2012; Sok et al., 2013) 
(Figure 7A,B). In addition, although none of the monoclonals carried the insertion in 
FWRL3 found in PGT121, the most potent antibodies had several amino acid mutations 
surrounding this region that may represent an alternative mechanism to enhance activity 
(Figure 7B).
We conclude that sequential immunization induces maturation of the predicted germline 
PGT121 antibody in a manner that in part recapitulates the maturation of the authentic 
monoclonal obtained from an HIV-1 infected individual.

 Discussion
Antibodies hold great promise for HIV-1 prophylaxis because they can prevent infection in 
pre-clinical models even at low concentrations (Gautam et al., 2016; Gruell et al., 2013; 
Klein et al., 2012; Mascola et al., 2000; Moldt et al., 2012; Shibata et al., 1999; Shingai et 
al., 2013). Moreover, broad and potent antibodies to HIV-1 develop in a fraction of infected 
individuals suggesting that such antibodies might also be elicited by vaccination (Burton and 
Hangartner, 2016; Haynes and Montefiori, 2006; Hraber et al., 2014; Klein et al., 2013b; 
Mascola and Haynes, 2013; McCoy and Weiss, 2013; West et al., 2014). However, despite 
over 25 years and a very significant effort by numerous investigators, bNAbs have not been 
elicited by vaccination, and a preventative vaccine against HIV-1 has yet to be developed.
There are several reasons why bNAbs may be difficult to elicit. First and foremost, is that all 
the bNAbs isolated to date show unusually high levels of somatic mutation that are required 
for their activity (Klein et al., 2013a; Klein et al., 2013b; Mascola and Haynes, 2013; 
Mouquet et al., 2012; Mouquet et al., 2010; West et al., 2014). Hypermutation is a random 
process that introduces one nucleotide change per 103 bp per cell division in B cells dividing 
in the dark zone of the germinal center (Victora and Nussenzweig, 2012). B cell residence in 
germinal centers and selection by affinity is limited for any given antigen (Victora and 
Nussenzweig, 2012). Therefore, acquisition of the right combination of mutations to 
produce a bNAb is highly unlikely to occur by immunization with a monomorphic antigen. 
Based on these considerations, we and others proposed that sequential immunization would 
be required for bNAb development (Dimitrov, 2010; Haynes et al., 2012; Jardine et al., 
2013; Klein et al., 2013a; Klein et al., 2013b; McGuire et al., 2013; Pancera et al., 2010; 
Scheid et al., 2009; Scheid et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2010). This idea is strongly supported by 
data obtained from prospective studies of infected humans that showed that bNAbs develop 
in response to sequentially evolving variants of HIV-1, which are in turn selected by the 
developing antibodies (Bhiman et al., 2015; Doria-Rose et al., 2014; Liao et al., 2013; Wu et 
al., 2015; Wu et al., 2011).
An additional impediment to immunization to elicit broadly neutralizing responses is that 
few of the predicted germline precursors of bNAbs bind to native-like antigens (Doria- Rose 
et al., 2014; Hoot et al., 2013; Klein et al., 2013a; Liao et al., 2013; Mouquet et al., 2012; 
Mouquet et al., 2010; Scheid et al., 2011; Xiao et al., 2009). Consistent with these 
observations, specifically engineered Env-based immunogens or naturally occurring 
germline-binding Env (Andrabi et al., 2015; Doria-Rose et al., 2014; Gorman et al., 2016; 
Liao et al., 2013) appear to be necessary to initiate immune responses by B cells that express 
the germline precursors of CD4bs bNAbs (Dosenovic et al., 2015; Jardine et al., 2013; 
Jardine et al., 2015; McGuire et al., 2013). However, germline immunogens did not elicit 
neutralizing responses in mice that carry the germline precursors of CD4bs antibodies 
(Dosenovic et al., 2015; Jardine et al., 2015). Only a native-like antigen activated B cells 
expressing a synthetic intermediate antibody to produce tier-2 neutralizing antibodies 
(Dosenovic et al., 2015). These results provided the initial direct experimental support for 
the notion that a succession of different immunogens would be necessary to drive bNAb 
maturation (Dosenovic et al., 2015). Extension of these results to humans might be achieved

 by immunizing individuals that have modest levels of serologic activity with native-like 
antigens to see if this would increase potency and breadth (Schoofs et al., 2016).
Previous experiments with HIV-1 antigens in mice, rabbits, and macaques showed some 
increase in the breadth and potency of the response to Tier 1 viruses by sequential 
immunization. However, those experiments did not produce serologic responses or 
antibodies with broad neutralizing activity against tier 2 strains, nor were somatic mutations 
analyzed (Eda et al., 2006; Klinman et al., 1991; Malherbe et al., 2011). In addition, 
immunization with singular native-like envelope trimers elicits antibodies that neutralize the 
autologous virus but not heterologous strains (Sanders et al., 2015). None of those studies 
involved germline-targeting immunogens to prime bnAb precursors specifically. Our 
experiments demonstrate that immunization with a germline-targeting prime followed by 
ELISA-guided boosting with a sequence of directional immunogens designed to be 
progressively more native-like, with decreasing binding affinities to the inferred germline 
PGT121/10-1074 bNAb, induces high levels of somatic hypermutation. Similar to humans 
that develop bNAbs, the level of somatic mutation in knock-in mice was directly related to 
the acquisition of neutralizing activity. Finding that priming with a germline-targeting 
immunogen followed by a sequence of boosting immunogens partially reproduces the 
development of PGT121 antibodies in knock-in mice represents proof of concept for the 
idea that sequential immunization can elicit bNAbs.
The sequential boosting protocols that succeeded to elicit bNAbs and high levels of SHM 
were those in which the epitope structure changed gradually with each successive boost. In 
contrast, the protocols that failed to elicit bNAbs involved large changes in the epitope in at 
least one boost, such as 10MUT followed by BG505 (Figure S4B), or 11MUTA followed by 
5MUT (Figure S4F). We have proposed that affinities of boosting immunogens for an 
intermediate mAb can be used to guide design of boosting protocols, that large affinity 
changes between successive immunogens corresponds to large changes in epitope structure, 
and that boosting protocols avoiding large affinity drops are more likely to succeed (Steichen 
et al., 2016). The observation that gradual protocols succeed here provides experimental 
evidence in support of that affinity drop analysis. This could allow future studies to prioritize 
experimental testing of sequential schemes (and optimize those schemes) based on similar 
affinity drop analyses.
Antibodies that target the glycan patch, including PGT121 are frequently found in infected 
individuals that develop bNAbs (Kong et al., 2013; Mouquet et al., 2012; Walker et al., 
2011). These antibodies are highly mutated, but less so than some others in the VRC01 class 
of bNAbs, and are therefore particularly attractive targets for vaccine development (Gray et 
al., 2011; Mouquet et al., 2012; Scheid et al., 2009; Scheid et al., 2011; Walker et al., 2011; 
Walker et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2010). Moreover, analysis of predicted 
intermediates in the PGT121 lineage showed that even antibodies with lower levels of 
mutation than PGT121, such as 3H+3L, have significant breadth and potency (Sok et al., 
2013). Similarly, an antibody targeting the N332 supersite, BF520.1, showing relatively low 
levels of mutation was recently isolated from an infected infant (Simonich et al., 2016). 
However, this antibody is over 100 times less potent than PGT121. The antibodies that

 develop in GLHL121 knock-in mice appear to be far more potent than BF520.1 and closely 
resemble PGT121 intermediates.
The antibody responses elicited by our immunization scheme are suboptimal because they 
do not reach the full activity of PGT121. Additional variables should to be tested to further 
increase the potency and breadth of these antibody responses. These include the use of 
alternative adjuvants (Stills, 2005), timing between boosting, and immunogen dose 
(Gonzalez-Fernandez and Milstein, 1998). Moreover, inter-species differences in the Ig 
repertoire, B cell development, and FcR or Toll-like receptor expression should also be 
considered (Mestas and Hughes, 2004). Most importantly, our experiments are limited to 
knock-in mice and cannot be immediately translated to organisms such as humans with a 
diverse immune system where the germline precursor B cell frequency is limited. Additional 
immunogens with increased affinities for the predicted germline forms of bNAbs will likely 
be required to activate the rare bNAb precursors found in the normal naive B cell repertoire.
Despite these important caveats, our experiments establish the principle that a vaccination 
strategy based on sequential immunization with specifically engineered immunogens 
induces B cells expressing predicted germline precursors to develop bNAbs.

Experimental model and subject details
Mice—Mice carrying the Ig V(D)J genes encoding the predicted germline or fully mature, 
mutated IgH and the predicted germline IgL corresponding to PGT121 (GLH121, MutH121, 
and GLL121 respectively) were produced by gene targeting Albino B6 (B6 (Cg)-Tyrc-2J/J) 
embryonic stem cells. The nucleotide sequence of the predicted germline PGT121 antibody 
was based on VH4-59*01, DH 3-3 and JH6*03 and the least mutated clonal relatives of 
PGT121/10-1074 like 10-996 (Mouquet et al., 2012). The GLL nucleotide sequence 
corresponds to germline VL3-21*02 and JL3*02 gene segments. The constant regions of 
IgH and IgL remain of mouse origin. The targeting vectors for IgH and IgL contained 
homologous regions flanking mouse D4-1 and J4. Recombination results in the deletion of 
the endogenous Js thereby minimizing rearrangement of the locus (Pelanda et al., 1997; Shih 
et al., 2002)
Mice were immunized every 2–4 weeks intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 10μg of protein, or a 
cocktail containing 3.3 μg of each VLC-SOSIP in Ribi (Sigma-Aldrich) or Alum (Thermo 
Scientific) adjuvant as specified. Serum samples were collected 2 weeks after immunization. 
Mice were maintained on regular chow. Male and female mice of 6–8 weeks of age were 
equally distributed in groups for knock-in mice characterization and immunization 
experiments. All animal procedures were performed in accordance to protocols approved by 
the Rockefeller University IACUC.

 Methods details
Immunogens—Engineered Env proteins used as immunogens (11MUTA, 10MUT, 7MUT, 
5MUT, 3MUT, BG505 (VLC2), VLC1, VLC3, VLC4 and VLC5 SOSIPs and 10MUT 
gp120) are described in (Steichen et al, submitted). These BG505-SOSIP.664 variants were 
modified as follows: 3MUT: T135A and T139I; 5MUT: V134Y, N136P, I138L, D140N; 
6MUT: 5MUT+ T139I; 7MUT: 6MUT+ T135A; 9MUTA: 7MUT+ N137F+ Q328M; 
9MUTB: 7MUT+ T135R+ Q328M; 10MUT: 7MUT+ N137F+ T320F+ Q328M; 11MUTA: 
10MUT+ D141N. VLC (variable loop cocktail) contains 5 native-like SOSIPs differing in 
the variable loops (Steichen et al, submitted). Monomeric Env gp120s (11MUTA, 10MUT, 
10MUT KO, 9MUTA, 9MUTB, 7MUT, 6MUT, 5MUT, 3MUT, 2MUT) and HIS tagged 
SOSIPs (BG505, VLCs) were used for ELISAs. AviTag-biotinylated Env gp120 proteins 
10MUT, 5MUT, P1981_c5_3, CAAN5342.A2 and corresponding PGT121 epitope mutant 
(KO) versions were used for sorting. 10MUT gp120 KO and 5MUT gp120 KO have 
mutations T303A, H330A, and N332T; P1981_c5_3 and CAAN5342.A2 gp120s have 
mutations T303A, D325A, R327A, H330A and N332T.
ELISA—ELISA to the monomeric gp120 versions of 11MUTA,10MUT, 10MUT KO, 9 
MUTB, 9MUTA, 7MUT, 6MUT, 5MUT, 3MUT and 2MUT were performed by coating of 
high bind 96 well plates (Corning #9018) with 100μl per well of a 2μg/ml protein solution in 
PBS overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed 6 times with washing buffer (1xPBS with 0.05% 
Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich)) and incubated in blocking buffer (1xPBS with 1% Milk) for 1 
hour (h) at room temperature (RT). Immediately after blocking, monoclonal antibodies or 
serum samples were added in blocking buffer and incubated for 2 h at RT. Serum samples 
were assayed at a 1:100 starting dilution and seven additional 3 fold serial dilutions. 
Monoclonal antibodies were tested at 5 or 10μg/ml as specified in the Results section. Plates 
were washed 6 times with washing buffer and then incubated with anti-mouse or anti human 
IgG secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Jackson Laboratories) 
in washing buffer at a 1:5000 dilution. Plates were developed by addition of the HRP 
substrate, ABTS (Life Technologies) and absorbance was measured at 405nm with an 
ELISA microplate reader (FluoStar Omega, BMG Labtech). Alternatively, for ELISA to the 
wtBG505 SOSIP and VLC SOSIP, plates were pre coated with an anti-6X His tag antibody 
(Abcam) in 1xPBS overnight at 4°C. After overnight incubation, plates were washed six 
times and blocked for 1 h at RT using the same buffers as specified above. Immediately after 
blocking, the His tagged wtBG505 SOSIP and VLC SOSIP proteins were added at 2μg/ml in 
dilution buffer (1xPBS with 1% fetal bovine serum and 0.2% Tween20) to all the wells and 
incubated at RT for 1 h. Plates were then washed six times and blocked for 1 h at RT. Serum 
Ig or monoclonal antibodies were added in dilution buffer at the dilutions previously 
mentioned and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C. Plates were then washed six times and 
incubated with secondary antibody for 1.5 hours at 37°C. Finally plates were developed and 
measured as specified above.
Ig purification—Igs were purified from 200μl of mouse serum using Ab Spin Trap Protein 
G sepharose columns (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturers instructions. Igs were 
eluted in 2 fractions of 400μl or alternatively in 4 fractions of 200μl. The Ig containing

 fractions were buffer exchanged with PBS by overnight dialysis at 4°C (dialysis cassettes 
20000 MWCO Thermo Scientific) and sterilized by filtration (0.22μM, Millex)
Neutralization assay—TZM-bl assays were performed as described (Montefiori, 2005). 
In brief, neutralization activity was calculated as a function of the reduction in Tat-induced 
luciferase expression in the TZM-bl reporter cell line after a single round of virus infection.
A total neutralization score was obtained by a sum of the individual scores assigned as (IC50 
<0.01 score 4; 0.01–0.1 score 3; 0.1–1 score 2; >1 score 1; not detectable (ND) score 0) 
normalized by the number of viruses tested in the TZM-bl assay.
Flow cytometry—Cells from spleens were stained with cocktails of the following anti-
mouse antibodies: anti-CD4 APC-eFluor 780, anti-CD8 APC-eFluor 780, anti-Ly-6G (Gr1) 
APC-eFluor 780, anti- F4/80 APC-eFluor 780, anti- B220 FITC, anti-CD38 Alexa Fluor 
700, anti- IgM PerCP-eFluor 710, anti-CD21/CD35 eFluor 450 and anti-IgG1 BV421 (BD 
Biosciences); anti-CD23 PE (BioLegend); anti IgD PE/Cy7 and anti Ig light chain λ 
(Biolegend). Dead cells were excluded by staining with the Live-dead aqua stain (Life 
Technologies). Stained cell samples were analyzed in a BD LSR Fortessa analyzer.
Single B cell sorting—B cells were enriched from cell suspensions of spleen and lymph 
nodes by negative selection using magnetic anti-CD43 micro beads (Miltenyi Biotec) and LS 
MACS separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec) as specified by the manufacturer. CD43− cells 
were stained with a cocktail of the following antibodies: anti-CD4 APC-eFluor 780, anti-
CD8 APC-eFluor 780, anti-Gr1 APC-eFluor 780, anti- F4/80 APC-eFluor 780, anti- B220 
FITC, anti-CD38 Alexa Fluor 700, anti-IgM PerCP-eFluor 710, anti-IgG1 BV421 (BD 
Biosciences) and Live-dead aqua stain (Life Technologies). For immunized mice, we used 
combinations of the following biotinylated proteins 10MUT, 5MUT, P1981_c5_3, 
CAAN5342.A2 and corresponding PGT121 epitope mutant (KO) versions as baits at a 
concentration of 5μg/ml. Streptavidin-conjugated PE or APC was used to label the wild type 
and the KO proteins respectively. Naïve B cells were obtained by sorting on Live-dead− 
CD4−CD8−Gr1−F4/80−CD38+B220+IgM+. B cells from immunized mice were obtained by 
sorting on Live-dead−CD4−CD8−Gr1−F4/80−CD38+B220+IgM−IgG+bait+KO bait−. Single 
cells were sorted into individual wells of a 96-well plate containing 4μl of lysis buffer 
(RNASin (Promega) 40 U/ml (0,3 ml), 10xPBS (Dulbecco) (0.2 ml), DTT (Invitrogen) 100 
mM (0.4 ml) and nuclease-free water (3.1 ml)) using a FACS Aria III (Becton Dickinson). 
Plates were immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C or processed for cDNA 
synthesis. cDNA from single cells was obtained by reverse transcription (Superscript III, 
Invitrogen) and used for amplification by nested PCR using the sequencing or cloning 
primers listed in (Figure S7) (von Boehmer et al, in press).PCR protocols (annealing (°C)/
elongation (sec)/number of cycles): 1st PCR (IgG IgH): 52/55/50; 2nd PCR (IgG IgH): 
54/55/50; 1st PCR (Igκ): 46/55/50; 2nd PCR (Igκ): 50/50/50; 1st PCR (IgM IgH): 52/55/50; 
2nd PCR (IgM IgH): 54/55/50.
Antibody cloning and production—Amplified heavy chain and light chain cDNAs 
were individually cloned into expression vectors containing the corresponding mouse 
antibody constant regions by using the sequence and ligation-independent cloning (SLIC)

 methodology. (Li and Elledge, 2007) (von Boehmer et al, in press). DNA sequences that are 
complementary to the destination vector were added to the amplified IgH and IgL cDNAs by 
PCR using the cloning primers listed in (Figure S7). PCR protocol (annealing (°C)/
elongation (sec)/number of cycles): 68/55/50. Amplified cDNA was purified with QIAquick 
96 PCR Purification Kit following manufacturer instructions. The linearized vector (30–
50ng) and the insert (4 μl of purified product) were ligated at 25°C for 2.5 min. Ligation was 
either stored at 4°C or transformed in DH5α competent bacteria. Next day, bacterial 
colonies were analyzed by PCR using the primers indicated in Figure S7. PCR protocol 
(annealing (°C)/elongation (sec)/number of cycles): 57/55/35.
Antibodies were produced by transient transfection of HEK293T cells with equal amounts 
of immunoglobulin heavy and light chain expression vectors. After 7 days, the supernatant 
was harvested and antibodies were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. IgG 
was purified with Protein G–Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Klein et al., 2014).
Analysis software—Geneious 9.0.4 and MacVector 14.0.3 were used for sequence 
analysis and graphs were created using R language. Flow cytometry data was processed 
using FlowJo 10.0.7. GraphPad Prism 6.0f was used for data analysis.
Quantification and statistical analysis
Statistical information including n, mean and statistical significance values are indicated in 
the text or the figure legends. GraphPad Prism 6.0f was used to calculate Pearson correlation 
coefficients and for statistical analysis by one-way ANOVA and Tukey multi comparison test 
or unpaired T-Test. Data were considered statistically significant at *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, 
***p ≤ 0.001 and ****p ≤ 0.0001.

ELISA-guided sequential immunization. (A) ELISAs against 10MUT gp120 and a mutated 
version of the same protein that is missing the PGT121 epitope (10MUT gp120 KO) using 
serum (1/100 starting dilution) from GLHL121 and MutHGLL121 mice primed with 
monomeric 10MUT (10MUT gp120, left) or trimeric 10MUT (10MUT SOSIP, right). (B) 
ELISA using human PGT121 (5μg/ml) against 10MUT gp120 and 10MUT gp120 KO. (C) 
Diagram shows the sequential immunization protocol delivered over a period of 5–6 months. 
(D) ELISAs of serum from a control and a sequentially immunized GLHL121 mouse after 
immunization steps 1–4. Test proteins are indicated above each column. ELISAs are ordered 
from left to right according to level of capture antigen modification compared to wtBG505. 
When indicated, the specificity of the serologic response for the PGT121 epitope was also 
evaluated by ELISA against the 10MUT gp120 KO protein. Each row of ELISA graphs 
represents the indicated step in the immunization protocol. A model of the corresponding 
immunogen is shown below each row (Steichen et al., submitted). Blue spheres represent 
glycans and red spheres indicate mutated residues. IgH (H1-3) and IgL (L1-3) loops are 
represented in the model of wtBG505. Red asterisks indicate the boosting immunogens. 
VLC= 5 native-like SOSIPs differing in the variable loops (Steichen et al, submitted). See 
also Figure S1 and S2.

 Figure 6. 
Monoclonal antibody neutralizing activity. (A) 3D plot showing neutralization activity (color 
coded), total number of amino acid mutations (X axis) and the number of mutations that are 
identical or chemically equivalent to mutations in the human PGT121, PGT122, PGT123 or 
10-1074 bNAbs (bNAb-like) (Y axis) for all monoclonal antibodies from GLHL121 mice 
immunized according to Protocol 1 and 2. Chemical equivalence is as in (B). Each antibody 
was assigned a neutralization score (see Materials and Methods). Red indicates higher 
neutralization scores. Correlation coefficients (r2) are indicated. r2 (X vs. Y) refers to the 
correlation between total amino acid mutations and the number of bNAb-like mutations; r2 
(X vs. Neut) refers to the correlation between total amino acid mutations and neutralization 
score: r2 (Y vs. Neut) refers to the correlation between bNAb-like mutations and 
neutralization score. (B) Graphs show the total number of amino acid mutations (X axis) in

 IgH (left) and IgL (right) of all antibody sequences from GLHL121 mice immunized with 
protocols 1, 2 or 3 vs. the number of mutations that are identical or chemically equivalent to 
mutations in the human PGT121, PGT122, PGT123 or 10-1074 bNAbs (bNAb-like) (Y 
axis). 292 and 405 IgH and IgL sequences respectively were analyzed. The size of the dot is 
proportional to the number of sequences. Chemical equivalence was as follows: Group 1: 
G/A/V/L/I; Group 2: S/T; Group 3: C/M; Group 4: D/N/E/Q; Group 5: R/K/H; Group 6: 
F/Y/W; Group 7: P. Correlation coefficient (r2) is indicated. (C) Table shows the results of 
TZM-bl assays on monoclonal antibodies from GLHL121 mice immunized according to 
Protocol 1 and 2 as indicated in the diagrams on top. The protocol, mouse, antibody name, 
and the 14 tier 2/1B HIV-1 isolates are indicated at left and top respectively. Neutralization 
activity code: IC50 <0.01 in red; 0.01–0.1 in orange; 0.1–1 in yellow; >1 in green; not 
detectable (ND) in gray; not tested indicated by a dash. See also Figure S6.

 Figure 7. 
Alignment of the monoclonal IgH and IgL to the inferred germline and mature mutated 
PGT121, PGT122, PGT123 and 10-1074 bNAbs. (A) Alignment of IgH sequences from the 
monoclonal antibodies in Figure 6. (B) Alignment of IgL sequences from monoclonal 
antibodies in Figure 6. The name of the antibody is indicated. Colors represent different 
amino acids. Dots represent identity to the germline reference sequence. Color coded 
asterisks next to the antibody name indicate neutralizing antibodies and their neutralization 
score (see Materials and Methods). Red indicates higher neutralization score. Amino acid 
substitutions that were previously identified as critical for binding to Env and neutralization 
of HIV-1 isolates are enclosed in a red rectangle. Antibody regions are indicated in gray. 
FR= framework region; CDR= complementarity determining region. Amino acid position is 
indicated with numbers on top of each reference sequence.
