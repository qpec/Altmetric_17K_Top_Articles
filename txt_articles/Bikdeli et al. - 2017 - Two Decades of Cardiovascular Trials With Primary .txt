Background-—Surrogate endpoint trials test strategies more efficiently but are accompanied by uncertainty about the relationship
between changes in surrogate markers and clinical outcomes.
Methods and Results-—We identified cardiovascular trials with primary surrogate endpoints published in the New England Journal of
Medicine, Lancet, and JAMA: Journal of the American Medical Association from 1990 to 2011 and determined the trends in publication
of surrogate endpoint trials and the success of the trials in meeting their primary endpoints. We tracked for publication of clinical
outcome trials on the interventions tested in surrogate trials. We screened 3016 articles and identified 220 surrogate endpoint trials.
From the total of 220 surrogate trials, 157 (71.4%) were positive for their primary endpoint. Only 59 (26.8%) surrogate trials had a
subsequent clinical outcomes trial. Among these 59 trials, 24 outcomes trial results validated the positive surrogates, whereas 20
subsequent outcome trials were negative following positive results on a surrogate. We identified only 3 examples in which the
surrogate trial was negative but a subsequent outcomes trial was conducted and showed benefit. Findings were consistent in a
sample cohort of 383 screened articles inclusive of 37 surrogate endpoint trials from 6 other high-impact journals.
Conclusions-—Although cardiovascular surrogate outcomes trials frequently show superiority of the tested intervention, they are
infrequently followed by a prominent outcomes trial. When there was a high-profile clinical outcomes study, nearly half of the
positive surrogate trials were not validated. Cardiovascular surrogate outcome trials may be more appropriate for excluding benefit
from the patient perspective than for identifying it. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2017;6:e005285. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.116.005285.)
Key Words: clinical trial • outcome • surrogate endpoints
A
ccording to an Institute of Medicine report, a surrogate
endpoint is intended to substitute for a clinical endpoint,
and expected to predict clinical benefit based on epidemio-
logic, therapeutic, pathophysiologic, or other evidence.1 Health
interventions are expected to impact clinical endpoints
through
pathways
that
include
intermediary
(surrogate)
endpoints, and testing of these interventions can be done
more quickly using smaller, shorter, and less expensive trials,
when focused on surrogates.2,3 This testing strategy has been
particularly adopted in cardiovascular medicine, where many
interventions required years to manifest their effects on
clinical outcomes.4,5
For example, dyslipidemia is known to be associated with
increased risk of cardiovascular events. Investigators have
tested the impacts of health interventions on dyslipidemia,
hoping that an intervention that targets dyslipidemia in the
short term would likewise lead to better cardiovascular
outcomes in the long term. However, torcetrapib, a choles-
teryl ester transfer protein inhibitor, improved lipid profile
dramatically while clinical outcomes were not improved (and
there was suggestion of clinical harm). Similarly, there have
been several studies where interventions showed benefits on
other surrogate endpoints, while the clinical outcomes were
unchanged or worsened.6–8 Therefore, despite the potential
advantages and efficiency, use of surrogate outcomes for
testing strategies is accompanied by concern for lack of
efficacy on clinical outcomes because of loose (or no) causal
relationship between the surrogates and clinically important

 outcomes, or because of coexisting but unexpected conse-
quences that health interventions may have on pathways
other than those of the surrogate outcome.9,10 However, the
extent of this phenomenon has not been characterized.
Our objective was to perform a systematic review of
cardiovascular trials published in the highest-impact journals,
characterizing the success of these trials in meeting their
primary endpoints. We also examined subsequent publication
of clinical outcome trials on interventions identified in our
review, determining concordance between the surrogate
outcome trials and subsequent clinical outcomes trials.
Methods
Data Source, Inclusion, and Exclusion Criteria
We searched MEDLINE with PubMed interface to screen all
publications in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM),
Lancet, and JAMA: Journal of the American Medical Association
(JAMA) (January 1, 1990, to December 31, 2011) based on a
search for cardiovascular trials using keywords and Medical
Subject Heading terms (Table 1). Studies have shown that
trials published in the highest-impact journals have a higher
methodological quality, larger sample size, and lower risk of
bias.11 Such journals are more likely to publish important and
potentially practice-changing clinical trials.12,13
We excluded noncardiovascular trials, safety trials, and
manuscripts that reported secondary or post hoc analyses.
We chose the cutoff date of December 31, 2011, for inclusion
of surrogate outcome clinical trials. This decision was made to
provide time for publication, in the 3 journals, of pertinent
subsequent clinical outcomes trials that followed the included
surrogate outcomes clinical trials.
Characterization of Surrogate and Clinical
Endpoints and Positive or Negative Results
We first characterized all trials as clinical endpoint trials, or
surrogate endpoint trials. Detailed definitions of surrogate
endpoints have been provided elsewhere.1 In brief, study
endpoints that could not be perceived and directly related to
patients but were derived from tests with plausibly important
medical information were considered as surrogate endpoints.
Common examples included blood tests and various imaging
test results. Clinical endpoint trials were those whose primary
endpoint was a patient-important and patient-perceived
outcome, such as mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, or
a composite of such variables. We determined the proportion
of surrogate endpoint trials that had positive results (ie, were
positive for and met their primary endpoint). Following
identification of a surrogate endpoint trial, we searched for
clinical endpoint trials on the same tested intervention in the
3 journals published until April 1, 2015. Among surrogate
trials that had a subsequent clinical outcomes trial, we
determined the concordance rate of the results in surrogate
trials and clinical outcomes trials (ie, whether the positive or
negative nature of results in a surrogate trial were replicated
in the clinical outcome trial). We explored the findings
according to the enrolled population (primary prevention,
secondary prevention, or hybrid cohorts). We also divided the
surrogate outcome trials into 3 subgroups of clinical biomark-
ers, imaging markers, and others4 (such as blood pressure).
Sample Replication in Another Cohort
To ascertain the robustness of the findings across surrogate
endpoint cardiovascular trials published in other journals, we
subsequently searched PubMed with the same search strat-
egy, but this time for publications in 6 additional high-impact
journals (Circulation, Journal of the American College of
Cardiology, European Heart Journal, JAMA Internal Medicine
[formerly Archives of Internal Medicine], British Medical
Journal, and Annals of Internal Medicine). Since such a search
retrieved an extremely large sample (14 279 hits), we
selected a 6-month period in the middle point of our study
(ie, from January 1, 2002, and July 1, 2002) to investigate the
broader cohort of journals for publication of surrogate
endpoint trials, as well as subsequent publication of clinical

tioned 6 journals or NEJM, Lancet, or JAMA.
Statistical Analyses
The study was designed by B.B., J.S.R., and H.M.K.. Three
additional authors (N.P., Y.A., and I.L.) performed the primary
screening and data extraction process. B.B. reviewed all the
results for consistency. Disagreements and questions were
resolved with J.S.R. and H.M.K. We reported qualitative
variables with frequencies and percentages. We used the chi-
square test to report the differences between categorical
variables. We used the Mantel–Haenszel test to report the
trends. We used a linear regression model to report the R2
between two variables with a presumably linear relationship.
Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA) and Stata version 12.0
(StataCorp, College Station, TX) were used for data extraction
and conducting the statistical analyses. This is a systematic
review of the literature, and, hence, no request for institu-
tional review board approval was required.
Results
Between January 1990 and December 2011, the number of
articles published in the 3 journals declined, while the number
of citations that included “trial*” in the PubMed search
remained relatively stable (Table 2). In the study period, we
manually screened 3016 articles through the systematic
search and identified 220 surrogate endpoint trials. There was
an increase in the annual number of surrogate endpoint trials
from 1990 to 2007 (P<0.01 for trend) and a decline thereafter
(Figure 1).
From the total of 220 surrogate trials, 157 (71.4%) were
positive for their primary outcome. Fifty-nine (26.8%) surro-
gate endpoint trials were followed by at least 1 clinical
endpoint trial. Year of publication had a modest association
with presence of subsequent outcome trials (R2=0.15), with
older trials being slightly more frequently followed by a clinical
outcomes trial. Among these 59 surrogate endpoint trials that
had a subsequent clinical endpoint trial, in 24 cases the
clinical endpoint trial results validated the positive surrogate
trials, while in 20 the subsequent clinical endpoint trial was
negative (Table 3).14–50 A negative surrogate endpoint trial
was less likely to be followed by a positive outcome trial and
we identified only 3 such examples (P=0.02, Figure 2).
Among the 220 surrogate endpoint cardiovascular trials,
56 enrolled primary prevention populations, 138 had a
secondary prevention population, and 26 had a hybrid cohort
(ie, a mix of primary and secondary prevention patients).
There was no difference based on the enrolled population in
the proportion of studies that had subsequent clinical
outcomes trials (P=0.51, Table 4).
From the total of 220 surrogate endpoint cardiovascular
trials, 101 had an imaging endpoint, 42 had clinical biomark-
ers, and 77 had other surrogate endpoints. Trials with an
imaging-related
primary
endpoint
were
more
frequently
followed by a clinical outcome trial (37 of 101 versus 22 of
119; P=0.02).
In our robustness search of 6 additional journals (Circu-
lation, Journal of the American College of Cardiology, European
Heart Journal, JAMA Internal Medicine, British Medical Journal,
and Annals of Internal Medicine) from January 1, 2002, to July
1, 2002, we screened 383 articles and identified 37 eligible
surrogate endpoint trials. Most of these trials were small
(median sample size: 71 patients) and were positive for their
primary surrogate outcome (N=25, 67.5%). Of these 37 trials,
the overwhelming majority (N=35, 94.5%) did not have a
subsequent clinical outcomes trial.

Except for the interval between 1990 and 1991, there was not a major change in the
number of clinical trials published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Lancet, and
JAMA: Journal of the American Medical Association per year. The number of all
publications has had a slight declining trend, whereas the number of publications that
had “trial*” anywhere in the article has slightly increased. Data obtained from PubMed

 Discussion
We found that while surrogate endpoint trials published in the
highest-impact journals frequently show superiority of the
tested intervention, less than one third of them had a clinical
outcomes trial of the intervention for the same purpose
published in those same highest-impact journals. Moreover,
when there was a subsequent clinical outcomes trial, nearly
half of them failed to validate the positive impact of the
intervention on the surrogate marker. The results were
fundamentally robust irrespective of enrolled population or
type of the surrogate outcome. The findings were also similarly
replicated (if not more pronounced) in a sample cohort from
other high-impact journals. Although surrogate markers are
intended to ultimately predict benefits for patient-important
outcomes, our findings question this premise. The issue may
be not that there are flaws in a surrogate endpoint, but that
interventions have a multitude of effects beyond the surrogate,
and it is difficult to judge the net result on outcomes based on
the surrogate endpoint, even one thought to be central to the
mechanism of disease or highly predictive of outcomes.
The suboptimal rate of outcomes trials that accompany a
surrogate endpoint trial is concerning and should draw the
attention of investigators and policymakers. The increase in
publication of surrogate endpoint cardiovascular trails from
1990 until a few years ago is likely reflective of surging
enthusiasm and dominance of surrogate endpoints among
investigators and academicians.2 The decline in recent years,
however, possibly reflective of lessons learned from unex-
pected results of surrogates on clinical endpoints, is encour-
aging.
Of the surrogate endpoint trials that were accompanied by
a clinical outcomes trial, we noticed several positive surrogate
endpoint trials that had a related negative clinical outcomes
trials. We hypothesize that the disconnect between the
surrogate endpoints and clinical outcomes is multifactorial.
Some surrogate endpoints might merely be risk markers but
not within the causal pathway, and therefore, intervening on
them might have had little impact to improve clinical
outcomes.9 Others may have been in the causal pathway
but not targeted by the right intervention. Yet, some other
surrogate endpoints might have been in the causal pathway
but targeted by interventions that had coexisting off-target
effects.6,51 Trials with positive imaging surrogate endpoints
were more frequently followed by clinical outcomes trials. It
could be hypothesized that structural changes usually need
more time to reflect a change based on an intervention than
blood biomarkers and could therefore better predict the
ultimate impact of a health intervention. These findings
warrant further investigation.
The choice regarding our study cohort is worthy of further
discussion. We investigated surrogate endpoint cardiovascu-
lar trials published in the NEJM, Lancet, and JAMA in order to
focus on those most likely to be the highest-impact and
highest-quality studies. Although inclusion of all other surro-
gate endpoint trials for the study could have been ideal,
achieving such a task is improbable for our group and many
others. A search of merely 6 additional impactful journals,
discussed above, retrieved more than 14 000 articles, and
expansion to other journals would have made the cohort
much larger. Our choice for searching subsequent outcome
trials in the top 3 journals should also be discussed. Most
often, high-impact cardiovascular clinical endpoint random-
ized controlled trials are published in these 3 journals and it
would be less frequent, if not rare, that an adequately
powered well-conducted cardiovascular clinical outcome trial
gets published outside of these 3 journals. There could be a
potential
theoretical
concern that the negative clinical
outcome trials are less likely to get published in those
journals. However, negative clinical outcome trials are
commonly published in NEJM, Lancet, and JAMA.52 The
results in a sample cohort of surrogate endpoint cardiovas-
cular trials published in 6 other high-impact journals further
support the generalizability of our key findings. In our search
of a sample of surrogate endpoint trials in other journals, the
few associated clinical endpoint trials, all were identified from
the 3 highest-impact journals, with no clinical outcomes trials
being found from the other 6 prestigious journals.

 Study Strengths
Our study provides real-world evidence about promises and
limitations of surrogate endpoint trials in cardiovascular
medicine. Infrequent follow-up with a clinical outcome trial
and poor concordance between positive surrogate endpoint
trials and subsequent clinical outcome trials are concerning.
We also observed that when a surrogate endpoint trial showed
negative results, it was rare that a subsequent clinical endpoint
trial proved the benefits of the intervention. We believe that our
key findings would be helpful not only for investigators and
funders but also for clinicians to recognize the benefits and
concerns about clinical decisions based on surrogate endpoint
trials. For investigators and funders, if the surrogate endpoint
trial shows promise for the tested intervention, subsequent
investigation with a clinical outcome trial would be the best
next step. However, if the surrogate endpoint trial is well
conducted and negative, the available finite resources could be
shifted towards more promising health interventions. For
practitioners and policymakers, including the Food and Drug
Administration, it might be best to focus on clinically important
endpoints, unless in scenarios where there is no interim way to
obtain clinical outcomes from well-conducted randomized
trials (eg, young patients with familial hypercholesterolemia or
those with rare conditions)—and even then, the label should
express the limitations of the evidence. These issues are
particularly important as the US Congress debates new
legislation that directs the Food and Drug Administration to
consider being more permissive in its approval process and to
depend more heavily on surrogate endpoints.53
Study Limitations
Our study, however, had limitations other than the choice of
study cohort discussed above. First, although in many cases
the associated clinical outcome trials were negative, a smaller
benefit on clinical endpoints could not be excluded. Second,
although the surrogate endpoint trials and the identified
associated outcome trials were very similar with regards to
patient population and interventions, inevitably the subse-
quent trials may not have been a full replica of the initial
surrogate endpoint trials (eg, using the same class of drug,
but not necessarily the same agent or the same dose).
However, using extremely strict criteria for identicalness of
the surrogate endpoint trials and subsequent clinical endpoint
trials would mean that an even lower proportion of the 220
surrogate endpoint trials were followed by clinical outcome
trials than the 59 that we identified by reasonable clinical
similarity. Third, although we believe that our study elucidates
some fundamental advantages and challenges of surrogate
endpoint trials, the focus was on cardiovascular trials.
Therefore, extrapolation to other study fields requires further
investigation. Preliminary results from other fields such as
oncology concur with our findings.54,55

 Conclusions
Our findings raise concern about the certainty of assuming
efficacy based on surrogate endpoints. Even if used for
approval of therapies in urgent situations, postmarketing
outcome trials are necessary. The good sensitivity of surro-
gate endpoint trials for detection of possible benefits,
however, is encouraging. Based on our findings, cardiovascu-
lar surrogate endpoint trials may be more appropriate for
excluding benefit from the patient perspective than for
identifying it—and all surrogate endpoint trials should be
interpreted in light of the possibility that they might not be
validated in a clinical outcomes trial.
Disclosures
Drs Ross and Krumholz receive support through Yale Univer-
sity from Johnson and Johnson to develop methods of clinical
trial data sharing and from Medtronic, Inc. and the Food and
Drug Administration to develop methods for postmarket
surveillance of medical devices; and from the Centers of
Medicare & Medicaid Services to develop and maintain
performance measures that are used for public reporting.
Dr Ross receives support through Yale University from the
Blue Cross Blue Shield Association to better understand
medical technology evaluation, the Laura and John Arnold
Foundation to support the Collaboration on Research Integrity
and Transparency at Yale, and the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration as part of the Centers for Excellence in Regulatory
Science and Innovation program. Dr Krumholz reported that
he chairs a cardiac scientific advisory board for UnitedHealth,
is on the advisory board for Element Science, and is a
participant/participant representative of the IBM Watson
Figure 2. Cardiovascular surrogate endpoint clinical trials published from 1990 to 2011 and subsequent results in clinical outcomes trials.
Overall, there were 220 surrogate endpoint trials, of which 157 (71.3%) were positive for their primary endpoint. Overall, 59 of the surrogate
endpoint clinical trials were followed by clinical outcome trials. See text for further details.
