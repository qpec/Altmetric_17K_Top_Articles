BACKGROUND
In patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 
with placement of stents, standard anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist plus dual 
antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with a P2Y12 inhibitor and aspirin reduces the risk of throm-
bosis and stroke but increases the risk of bleeding. The effectiveness and safety of antico-
agulation with rivaroxaban plus either one or two antiplatelet agents are uncertain.
METHODS
We randomly assigned 2124 participants with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who had un-
dergone PCI with stenting to receive, in a 1:1:1 ratio, low-dose rivaroxaban (15 mg once 
daily) plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for 12 months (group 1), very-low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg 
twice daily) plus DAPT for 1, 6, or 12 months (group 2), or standard therapy with a dose-
adjusted vitamin K antagonist (once daily) plus DAPT for 1, 6, or 12 months (group 3). 
The primary safety outcome was clinically significant bleeding (a composite of major 
bleeding or minor bleeding according to Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] 
criteria or bleeding requiring medical attention).
RESULTS
The rates of clinically significant bleeding were lower in the two groups receiving rivar-
oxaban than in the group receiving standard therapy (16.8% in group 1, 18.0% in group 2, 
and 26.7% in group 3; hazard ratio for group 1 vs. group 3, 0.59; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], 0.47 to 0.76; P<0.001; hazard ratio for group 2 vs. group 3, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.80; 
P<0.001). The rates of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke 
were similar in the three groups (Kaplan–Meier estimates, 6.5% in group 1, 5.6% in group 
2, and 6.0% in group 3; P values for all comparisons were nonsignificant).
CONCLUSIONS
In participants with atrial fibrillation undergoing PCI with placement of stents, the admin-
istration of either low-dose rivaroxaban plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for 12 months or very-low-
dose rivaroxaban plus DAPT for 1, 6, or 12 months was associated with a lower rate of 
clinically significant bleeding than was standard therapy with a vitamin K antagonist plus 
DAPT for 1, 6, or 12 months. The three groups had similar efficacy rates, although the 
observed broad confidence intervals diminish the surety of any conclusions regarding ef-
ficacy. (Funded by Janssen Scientific Affairs and Bayer Pharmaceuticals; PIONEER AF-PCI

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
A 
pproximately 5 to 8% of patients 
who undergo percutaneous coronary in-
tervention (PCI) have atrial fibrillation.1-3 
Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with a P2Y12 
inhibitor and aspirin is superior to oral antico-
agulation with a vitamin K antagonist in reduc-
ing the risk of thrombosis in patients undergo-
ing placement of a first-generation stent,4 but oral 
anticoagulation is superior to DAPT in reducing 
the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with 
atrial fibrillation.5 The treatment strategy for pa-
tients with atrial fibrillation who have received 
stents must balance the risk of stent thrombosis 
and ischemic stroke with the risk of bleeding. 
A common guideline-supported practice is to 
combine all three drugs in a strategy known as 
triple therapy6; however, this approach may result 
in excessive major bleeding, with rates of 2.2% 
within the first month and 4 to 12% within the 
first year of treatment.7
Novel oral anticoagulants may provide advan-
tages over vitamin K antagonists. Rivaroxaban, 
an oral factor Xa inhibitor, has been associated 
with a lower risk of stroke and systemic embo-
lism than vitamin K antagonists among patients 
with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, with similar 
rates of major bleeding but significantly lower 
rates of intracranial hemorrhage and fatal bleed-
ing.8 Rivaroxaban also reduced the risk of death 
from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, 
and stroke when administered as secondary pre-
vention after an acute coronary syndrome in the 
ATLAS ACS 2–TIMI 51 trial (Anti-Xa Therapy to 
Lower Cardiovascular Events in Addition to Stan-
dard Therapy in Subjects with Acute Coronary 
Syndrome–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarc-
tion 51).9 We conducted the PIONEER AF-PCI 
trial (Open-Label, Randomized, Controlled, Multi-
center Study Exploring Two Treatment Strategies 
of Rivaroxaban and a Dose-Adjusted Oral Vita-
min K Antagonist Treatment Strategy in Subjects 
with Atrial Fibrillation who Undergo Percutane-
ous Coronary Intervention) to compare the safety 
of the following three treatment strategies after 
PCI with stent placement in patients with parox-
ysmal, persistent, or permanent nonvalvular atrial 
fibrillation: a regimen established in the WOEST 
trial (What Is the Optimal Antiplatelet and Anti-
coagulant Therapy in Patients with Oral Antico-
agulation and Coronary Stenting)10 of low-dose 
rivaroxaban (15 mg once daily) plus a single P2Y12 
inhibitor, a regimen established in the ATLAS 
ACS 2–TIMI 51 trial of very-low-dose rivaroxa-
ban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus DAPT, and stan-
dard triple therapy with a vitamin K antagonist 
plus DAPT.
Methods
Trial Oversight
PIONEER AF-PCI was an international, multi-
center, randomized, open-label trial. The trial was 
sponsored by Janssen Scientific Affairs and Bayer 
Pharmaceuticals. The executive committee was 
responsible for the design and conduct of the 
trial. Although the sponsors coordinated the data 
management, all statistical analyses were per-
formed independently by the PERFUSE study 
group, whose members used a copy of the com-
plete raw database. The academic members of the 
executive committee were solely responsible for 
drafting the manuscript and editing all versions. 
All the authors made the decision to submit the 
manuscript for publication. The authors vouch 
for the accuracy and completeness of the data 
and for adherence to the trial protocol, available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The 
trial was approved by national and institutional 
regulatory agencies and ethics committees. An 
independent data and safety monitoring board 
monitored the scientific integrity and the safety 
of the trial. Complete lists of the members of the 
executive committee, PERFUSE study group, and 
data and safety monitoring board, as well as all 
investigators, can be found in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix, available at NEJM.org. Details of 
the trial design have been published previously.11
Trial Population
Men and women at least 18 years of age who had 
paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent nonvalvu-
lar atrial fibrillation (defined as atrial fibrillation 
not considered to be caused by a primary valve 
stenosis) and who had just undergone PCI with 
stent placement were enrolled. All participants 
provided written informed consent.
The main inclusion criterion was documented 
atrial fibrillation that occurred within 1 year be-
fore screening; patients with documented atrial 
fibrillation that occurred more than 1 year before 
screening were also eligible if the participant had 
been receiving oral anticoagulation for atrial fi-
brillation for the 3 months immediately preced-
ing the index PCI. Major exclusion criteria were

Bleeding in Patients with AF Undergoing PCI
a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, 
clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding 
within 12 months before randomization, a calcu-
lated creatinine clearance of less than 30 ml per 
minute, anemia of an unknown cause with a 
hemoglobin concentration of less than 10 g per 
deciliter, or any other condition known to increase 
the risk of bleeding. The complete list of inclusion 
and exclusion criteria is provided in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
Treatment
Randomization occurred within 72 hours after 
sheath removal, once the international normal-
ized ratio (INR) was 2.5 or lower. Before random-
ization, the investigator prespecified the intended 
duration of DAPT (1, 6, or 12 months) and the 
intended P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel, prasugrel, 
or ticagrelor); the participants were stratified 
according to the intended inhibitor type and du-
ration of DAPT and were then randomly assigned, 
in a 1:1:1 ratio, to group 1, 2, or 3.
Participants in group 1 were assigned to re-
ceive rivaroxaban at a dose of 15 mg once daily 
(or a dose of 10 mg once daily if they had mod-
erate renal impairment, indicated by a creatinine 
clearance of 30 to 50 ml per minute) plus back-
ground single antiplatelet therapy with clopido-
grel at a dose of 75 mg once daily (or ticagrelor 
at a dose of 90 mg twice daily or prasugrel at a 
dose of 10 mg once daily in ≤15% of partici-
pants) for 12 months. Although aspirin could be 
administered up to 24 hours before the first 
dose of the trial drugs, aspirin at all doses was to 
be withheld after randomization.
Participants in group 2 were assigned to re-
ceive rivaroxaban at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily 
plus background DAPT with low-dose aspirin 
(75 to 100 mg per day) and clopidogrel at a dose 
of 75 mg once daily (or ticagrelor at a dose of 
90 mg twice daily or prasugrel at a dose of 10 mg 
once daily in ≤15% of participants) for a prespeci-
fied duration of 1, 6, or 12 months. Participants 
who received the treatment for 1 or 6 months 
then received rivaroxaban at a dose of 15 mg once 
daily (or 10 mg once daily if they had moderate 
renal impairment) plus background single anti-
platelet therapy with low-dose aspirin (75 to 
100 mg per day) for the remainder of the 12-month 
treatment period.
Participants in group 3 were assigned to re-
ceive the vitamin K antagonist warfarin once 
daily (with dose adjustment to achieve a target 
INR of 2.0 to 3.0) plus background DAPT with 
low-dose aspirin (75 to 100 mg per day) and 
clopidogrel at a dose of 75 mg once daily (or 
ticagrelor at a dose of 90 mg twice daily or pra-
sugrel at a dose of 10 mg once daily in ≤15% of 
participants) for a prespecified duration of 1, 6, or 
12 months. Participants who received the treat-
ment for 1 or 6 months then received warfarin 
once daily (with dose adjustment to achieve a 
target INR of 2.0 to 3.0) plus background single 
antiplatelet therapy with low-dose aspirin (75 to 
100 mg per day) for the remainder of the 12-month 
treatment period.
Rivaroxaban was provided to all participants 
free of charge. The antiplatelet drugs were con-
sidered to be standard therapy and were not paid 
for by the trial. Warfarin was provided to par-
ticipants in all countries except those in which 
it is considered to be standard therapy (Canada, 
Chile, England, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the 
United States).
End Points
The primary safety end point was the occurrence 
of clinically significant bleeding (a composite of 
major bleeding or minor bleeding according to 
Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] 
criteria or bleeding requiring medical attention; 
for details, see the Supplementary Appendix) dur-
ing the treatment period (which was defined as 
the time from the first administration of a trial 
drug to 2 days after the trial drugs were discon-
tinued, through 12 months of therapy). Second-
ary end points included the incidence of each 
component of the primary safety end point, as 
well as the following efficacy end points: the 
occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular 
event (a composite of death from cardiovascular 
causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke), each 
component of the major adverse cardiovascular 
event end point, and stent thrombosis. Explor-
atory end points included the occurrence of major 
bleeding defined according to the International 
Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) 
criteria and the occurrence of severe bleeding 
defined according to the Global Utilization of 
Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Factor for 
Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) criteria.
All efficacy events included in the secondary 
end points were adjudicated by an independent 
clinical events committee whose members were

unaware of the treatment assignments. Data on 
bleeding events were entered into an electronic 
data-capture system and were subsequently 
classified by type of bleeding with the use of a 
computer-generated algorithm that was based 
on 100% source-verified data. Major and minor 
bleeding events were adjudicated by the clinical 
events committee, as were 15% of bleeding events 
requiring medical attention; the remaining 85% 
were classified with the use of the algorithm 
only. The concordance of the algorithm with the 
outcomes adjudicated by the clinical events com-
mittee was monitored by the data and safety 
monitoring committee on an ongoing basis (Fig. 
S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed with the 
use of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute). 
Analyses were based on pooled data across all 
Figure 1. Stratification, Randomization, and Follow-up.
Participants were stratified according to the intended duration (1 month, 6 months, or 12 months, as specified by 
the investigators) of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), after which they were randomly assigned to one of three groups. 
Participants in group 1 were assigned to receive low-dose rivaroxaban (15 mg once daily) plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for 
12 months, those in group 2 were assigned to receive very-low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus DAPT for 
1, 6, or 12 months, and those in group 3 were assigned to receive standard therapy with a dose-adjusted vitamin K 
antagonist (once daily) plus DAPT for 1, 6, or 12 months. Six participants from one site (two in each group) were 
excluded from all secondary efficacy analyses because of violations of Good Clinical Practice guidelines.

trial drug to the first occurrence of a primary 
safety end-point event was analyzed with the use 
of a Cox proportional-hazards model, with treat-
ment group as a covariate and with stratification 
according to the intended DAPT duration for the 
comparison of group 2 with group 3 (no strati-
fication for the comparison of group 1 with 
group 3), to provide a point estimate (hazard 
ratio) and a two-sided 95% confidence interval. 
Cumulative event rates were estimated at 360 days 
with the use of the Kaplan–Meier method, and 
P values were calculated with the use of the two-
sided log-rank test. Before the data were un-
blinded, six participants from one site (two in 
each group) were excluded from all secondary 
efficacy analyses because of violations of Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines but were included in 
the primary safety analysis. P values of less than 
0.05 were considered to indicate statistical sig-
nificance.
Results
Participants
From May 2013 through July 2015, a total of 
2124 participants were stratified according to 
intended DAPT duration and were then ran-
domly assigned to one of three treatment groups 
(Fig. 1). Among the participants who received at 
least one dose of the trial treatment, 21.0% of 
the participants in group 1, 21.1% in group 2, 
and 29.4% in group 3 permanently discontinued 
the treatment before the scheduled termination 
date (P<0.001 for both comparisons [group 1 vs. 
group 3 and group 2 vs. group 3]) (Table S6 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). The rate of with-
drawal of consent for continued participation in 
the trial was 0.4% (3 participants in each group) 
(P>0.99 for both comparisons). No participants 
were lost to follow-up.
The baseline characteristics were well matched 
across the treatment groups (Table 1). Most of 
the trial participants were white men. Less than 
10% of the participants were enrolled in North 
America. The intended P2Y12 inhibitor for the 
majority of participants was clopidogrel, with 
that drug chosen for a greater proportion of 
participants in group 3 than in group 1 or 2. 
Among participants who received a vitamin K 
antagonist (group 3), the time in the therapeutic 
range (INR range of 2.0 to 3.0) was 65.0% and 
did not differ by country or region (Table S7 and 
Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Safety End Points
At 12 months, the primary safety end point 
of clinically significant bleeding had occurred in 
16.8% of participants in group 1, 18.0% in 
group 2, and 26.7% in group 3 (hazard ratio for 
group 1 vs. group 3, 0.59; 95% confidence inter-
val [CI], 0.47 to 0.76; P<0.001; hazard ratio for 
group 2 vs. group 3, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.80; 
P<0.001) (Fig. 2A and Table 2). The lower rate of 
bleeding in the two groups receiving rivaroxaban 
than in the group receiving the vitamin K antago-
nist was consistent across multiple subgroups 
(Figs. S5 and S6 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). The results of the intention-to-treat analysis 
did not differ significantly from the results of the 
Figure 2 (facing page). Cumulative Incidence of the Primary 
Safety End Point and a Secondary Efficacy End Point.
Panel A shows the cumulative incidence of the primary 
safety end point of clinically significant bleeding (a com-
posite of major bleeding or minor bleeding according 
to Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] criteria 
or bleeding requiring medical attention), and Panel B 
shows the cumulative incidence of the secondary effi-
cacy end point of major adverse cardiovascular events 
(a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, 
myocardial infarction, or stroke) during the treatment 
period (from the time of the first administration of a 
trial drug up to 2 days after the trial treatment was dis-
continued) in the three treatment groups. Participants 
in group 1 were assigned to receive low-dose rivaroxa-
ban (15 mg once daily) plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for 12 
months, those in group 2 were assigned to receive very-
low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus dual 
 
antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 1, 6, or 12 months, and 
those in group 3 were assigned to receive standard 
therapy with a dose-adjusted vitamin K antagonist 
(once daily) plus DAPT for 1, 6, or 12 months. In each 
panel, the inset shows the same data on an expanded 
y axis.

Data are for all participants who underwent randomization and received at least one dose of the trial regimen during the treatment period. Participants in group 1 were assigned to re-
ceive low-dose rivaroxaban (15 mg once daily) plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for 12 months, those in group 2 were assigned to receive very-low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus DAPT 
for 1, 6, or 12 months, and those in group 3 were assigned to receive standard therapy with a dose-adjusted vitamin K antagonist (once daily) plus DAPT for 1, 6, or 12 months. The pri-
mary safety end point of clinically significant bleeding was a composite of major bleeding or minor bleeding, defined according to Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) criteria, 
or bleeding requiring medical attention. Only one event for each participant could be included in the analysis of the composite end point and in the analyses of each component of the 
composite end point. If a participant had more than one type of event, the first event that occurred is the event that was included in the analysis of the composite end point, but the 
first occurrence of each type of event was included in the analyses for each component of the composite end point. Cumulative event rates were estimated with the use of the Kaplan–
Meier method, hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated with the use of the Cox proportional-hazards model, and P values were calculated with the use of the two-sid-
ed log-rank test.

group 3, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.86; P 
= 
0.002). 
There was a lower incidence in groups 1 and 2 than 
in group 3 of major bleeding defined according to 
ISTH criteria and severe bleeding defined accord-
ing to GUSTO criteria (Tables S2 and S11 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Efficacy End Points
A major adverse cardiovascular event (a compos-
ite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocar-
dial infarction, or stroke) occurred in 6.5% of the 
participants in group 1, 5.6% in group 2, and 
6.0% in group 3 (P>0.05 for both comparisons) 
(Fig. 2B and Table 3). The power to detect at 
least a 15-percentage-point lower risk of the com-
posite end point of a major adverse cardiovascu-
lar event with rivaroxaban than with a vitamin K 
antagonist with 700 participants per group was 
11.4% (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
The rates for each component of the end point 
did not differ significantly among the three treat-
ment groups. The rates of stent thrombosis were 
low and similar among the three groups. The re-
sults were homogeneous across multiple sub-
groups, and there was no evidence of a signifi-
cant modulation or interaction with respect to 
treatment effect (Figs. S7 and S8 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). The results of the intention-
to-treat analysis did not differ significantly from 
the results of the modified intention-to-treat 
analysis (Table S12 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
Discussion
In participants with atrial fibrillation who had 
undergone PCI with stent placement, treatment 
that included either low-dose or very-low-dose 
rivaroxaban was associated with a lower risk of 
clinically significant bleeding than was standard 
triple therapy that included a vitamin K antago-
nist. The rates of major adverse cardiovascular 
events were similar but had broad confidence 
intervals among the three treatment groups.
The dose of rivaroxaban used in the manage-
ment of atrial fibrillation may differ from the 
dose used in the management of an acute coro-
nary syndrome. The administration of rivaroxa-
ban at a dose of 20 mg once daily without anti-
platelet agents in patients with nonvalvular atrial 
fibrillation was noninferior to dose-adjusted 
warfarin in reducing the rates of stroke and sys-
temic embolism and of fatal and intracranial 
bleeding in the ROCKET-AF trial (Rivaroxaban 
Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition 
Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Pre-
vention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial 
Fibrillation).8 A reduced dose of 15 mg daily in 
participants with moderate impairment of renal 
function (i.e., a creatinine clearance of 30 to 49 ml 
per minute) was associated with efficacy and 
safety profiles similar to those seen with the 
20-mg dose in participants without renal im-
pairment. However, both the 15-mg and 20-mg 
doses of rivaroxaban for atrial fibrillation were 
associated with a significantly increased risk 
of bleeding if administered concomitantly with 
DAPT in the ATLAS ACS–TIMI 46 trial.12 Indeed, 
the addition of rivaroxaban at a daily dose of 10 mg 
to DAPT in participants with an acute coronary 
syndrome was associated with excessive bleed-
ing, including a higher risk of fatal bleeding than 
that associated with a daily dose of 5 mg.9,12 Thus, 
patients with an acute coronary syndrome who 
are receiving DAPT may be unable to safely re-
ceive the doses of rivaroxaban that are tradition-
ally administered in patients with atrial fibrilla-
tion. In the ATLAS ACS 2–TIMI 51 trial, among 
participants with an acute coronary syndrome 
who were receiving DAPT, the addition of a very 
low dose of rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) was 
associated with lower rates of death from car-
diovascular causes, myocardial infarction, and 
stroke than was DAPT alone.9
The WOEST trial was a randomized trial that 
compared the safety and efficacy of clopidogrel 
plus warfarin with those of clopidogrel plus as-
pirin and warfarin (triple therapy) among 573 pa-
tients undergoing PCI who required anticoagula-
tion. The group receiving clopidogrel plus warfarin 
had significantly lower rates of any bleeding 
through 1 year after PCI than did the group re-
ceiving triple therapy. The PIONEER and WOEST 
trials differ in several regards. The PIONEER 
population is composed entirely of participants 
with atrial fibrillation, whereas only 69% (162) 
of the participants in the group receiving stan-
dard triple therapy in the WOEST trial had atrial 
fibrillation.10 In the PIONEER trial, only 22% of 
the patients receiving triple therapy were treated 
for 1 year, whereas in the WOEST trial, 66% of 
such participants were treated for 1 year.10 The 
shorter duration of triple therapy in PIONEER 
may have made it more difficult to show a reduc-

Data are for all participants who underwent randomization and received at least one dose of the trial regimen during the treatment period; 
six participants from one site (two in each group) were excluded from all secondary efficacy analyses because of violations of Good Clinical 
Practice guidelines. Participants in group 1 were assigned to receive low-dose rivaroxaban (15 mg once daily) plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for 12 
months, those in group 2 were assigned to receive very-low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus DAPT for 1, 6, or 12 months, and 
those in group 3 were assigned to receive standard therapy with a dose-adjusted vitamin K antagonist (once daily) plus DAPT for 1, 6, or 12 
months. The end point of a major adverse cardiovascular event was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, 
or stroke. Only one event for each participant could be included in the analysis of the composite end point and in the analyses of each com-
ponent of the composite end point. If a participant had more than one type of event, the first event that occurred is the event that was included 
in the analysis of the composite end point, but the first occurrence of each type of event was included in the analyses for each component 
of the composite end point. Cumulative event rates were estimated with the use of the Kaplan–Meier method, hazard ratios and 95% con-
fidence intervals were calculated with the use of the Cox proportional-hazards model, and P values were calculated with the use of the two-

Bleeding in Patients with AF Undergoing PCI
tion in the rate of bleeding with the rivaroxaban 
strategies but is more reflective of current clini-
cal practice.
This trial has several limitations. First, the 
secondary analyses showed that the efficacy of 
each of the two doses of rivaroxaban was similar 
to that of standard therapy. However, the num-
ber of secondary efficacy end points in this study 
was small, and the trial was not powered to 
definitively establish either superiority or non-
inferiority. Using the rate for a major adverse 
cardiovascular event observed in the standard-
therapy group of 6.0%, and assuming 90% 
power to detect a difference between the treat-
ment groups of 15 percentage points at an alpha 
level of 0.05, we calculate that the sample size 
needed for a superiority trial would be 13,598 
participants per group (a total of 40,794 partici-
pants across three groups). Because enrollment 
and follow-up in this trial involving only 2100 
participants at 431 sites required 3 years, the fea-
sibility of enrolling more than 20 times the num-
ber of participants over such a protracted period 
of time is questionable.
Second, the regimen of very-low-dose riva-
roxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus DAPT is indi-
cated in Europe and a number of other countries 
for the prevention of cardiovascular events in pa-
tients with an acute coronary syndrome. How-
ever, the rivaroxaban dose of 15 mg once daily 
(or 10 mg once daily in those with moderate 
renal impairment) is not currently approved for 
the management of an acute coronary syndrome 
or atrial fibrillation.
Third, for one individual component of the 
composite efficacy end point (stroke) within one 
stratum of DAPT duration (6 months), the effi-
cacy results were significantly in favor of stan-
dard therapy versus therapy with very-low-dose 
rivaroxaban plus DAPT. For other components of 
the composite efficacy end point (myocardial in-
farction and the composite end point) and within 
another stratum of DAPT duration (12 months), 
the groups receiving rivaroxaban tended to have 
results that were superior to those in the stan-
dard-therapy group. The overall trial is under-
powered, and individual efficacy end points with-
in subgroups are even more underpowered. Even 
if significant results are observed, type I error or 
the play of chance could explain the observed 
results. There was no significant interaction be-
tween DAPT duration and the composite efficacy 
end point, all-cause stroke, or ischemic stroke 
(Tables S9 through S12 in the Supplementary 
Appendix), and therefore, evaluation of any one 
stratum of DAPT duration loses validity. Stratifi-
cation to 1, 6, or 12 months of DAPT was based 
on clinician choice, and patients were not ran-
domly assigned to a duration of DAPT. As might 
be expected, patient characteristics were imbal-
anced across the strata of DAPT durations and 
within each stratum of DAPT durations across 
the three treatment groups (Table S4 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). Insofar as there are dif-
ferences in identified confounders, there most 
likely are also differences in unidentified con-
founders. The statistical power for all these ef-
ficacy end points was quite low, between 5.4 and 
13% (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
There was no adjustment for multiplicity in test-
ing all these efficacy end points. There was a 
lack of consistency in the directionality of the 
efficacy end-point benefit with standard therapy 
and therapy containing rivaroxaban, which rais-
es questions regarding the validity of any single 
observation. Finally, stent thrombosis was not 
adjudicated by a core laboratory in this trial.13 As 
a result of all these limitations, it is inappropri-
ate to draw firm conclusions regarding efficacy 
from these data.
Among participants with atrial fibrillation who 
underwent PCI with stenting, administration of 
either low-dose rivaroxaban (15 mg once daily) 
plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for 12 months or very-low-
dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus DAPT 
for 1, 6, or 12 months was associated with a 
lower rate of clinically significant bleeding than 
was standard therapy with a vitamin K antago-
nist plus DAPT for 1, 6, or 12 months. The three 
groups had similar efficacy rates, although the 
observed broad confidence intervals diminish the 
surety of any conclusions regarding efficacy.
