Abstract
Importance—Prenatal antidepressant exposure has been associated with adverse outcomes. 
Previous studies, however, may not have adequately accounted for confounding.
Objective—To evaluate alternative hypotheses for associations between first-trimester 
antidepressant exposure and birth and neurodevelopmental problems.
Design, Setting, and Participants—This retrospective cohort study included Swedish 
offspring born between 1996 and 2012 and followed through 2013 or censored by death or 
emigration. Analyses controlling for pregnancy, maternal, and paternal covariates, as well as 
sibling comparisons, timing of exposure comparisons, and paternal comparisons, were used to 
examine the associations.
Exposures—Maternal self-reported first-trimester antidepressant use and first-trimester 
antidepressant dispensations.
Main Outcomes and Measures—Preterm birth (< 37 gestational weeks), small for gestation 
age (birth weight < 2 SDs below the mean for gestational age), and first inpatient or outpatient 
clinical diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in 
offspring.
Results—Among 1,580,629 offspring (mean gestational age 279 days; 48.6% female; 1.4% [n = 
22,544] with maternal first-trimester self-reported antidepressant use) born to 943,776 mothers 
(mean age at childbirth 30 years), 7.0% of exposed vs. 4.8% of unexposed offspring were preterm, 
2.5% of exposed vs. 2.2% of unexposed were small for gestational age, 5.3% of exposed vs. 2.1%

 of unexposed were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder by age 15, and 12.6% of exposed vs. 
5.5% of unexposed were diagnosed by attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder by age 15. At the 
population level, first-trimester exposure was associated with all outcomes, compared with 
unexposed offspring (preterm birth: OR = 1.5, 95% CI, [1.4, 1.6]; small for gestational age: OR = 
1.2, 95% CI, [1.1, 1.3]; autism spectrum disorder: HR = 2.0, 95% CI, [1.8, 2.3]; attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder: HR = 2.2, 95% CI, [2.0, 2.4]). However, in models that compared siblings 
while adjusting for pregnancy, maternal, and paternal traits, first-trimester antidepressant exposure 
was associated with preterm birth (OR = 1.3, 95% CI [1.2, 1.5]) but not with small for gestational 
age (OR = 1.0, 95% CI [0.8, 1.3]), autism spectrum disorder (HR = 0.8, 95% CI [0.6, 1.1]), or 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (HR = 1.0, 95% CI [0.8, 1.3]). Results from analyses 
assessing associations with maternal dispensations before pregnancy and paternal first-trimester 
dispensations were consistent with findings from the sibling comparisons.
Conclusion and Relevance—Among offspring born in Sweden, after accounting for 
confounding factors, first-trimester antidepressant exposure, compared to no exposure, was 
associated with a small increased risk of preterm birth but no increased risk of small for 
gestational age, autism spectrum disorder, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
Given the increasing prevalence of antidepressant use among pregnant women,1 gaining 
knowledge on the safety of their use during pregnancy is a public health priority. Prenatal 
antidepressant exposure is associated with birth and neurodevelopmental problems, 
including shorter gestation,2 reduced fetal growth,2 autism spectrum disorder,3–6 and 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.7 These associations may be due to causal 
mechanisms (e.g., dysfunctional serotonin signaling8). However, there are alternative 
explanations for the associations. Maternal depression and stress are associated with birth9 
and neurodevelopmental10 problems, suggesting that antidepressant associations could be 
attributable to confounding by indication for such treatment. Furthermore, autism spectrum 
disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder have strong genetic influences,11 and 
these influences partially overlap with genetic contributions to depression.12,13 Thus, genetic 
transmission of shared risk for neurodevelopmental problems and depression could explain 
the associations (i.e., passive gene-environmental correlation). Other factors, such as poor 
health practices during pregnancy, could also account for the associations.14
Randomized clinical trials have not been able to test the safety of antidepressant use during 
pregnancy because pregnant women are typically excluded from these studies. Thus, 
researchers must use observational designs to rule out alternative explanations for the 
associations.15 The present study used four such designs to explore associations between 
first-trimester antidepressant exposure (assessed via both maternal self-report and registered 
medication dispensations) and offspring birth and neurodevelopmental problem (i.e., 
preterm birth, small for gestational age, autism spectrum disorder, and attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder. In addition to (1) statistical controls to adjust for measured 
pregnancy, maternal, and paternal characteristics, this study used (2) sibling comparisons to 
account for unmeasured genetic and environmental factors that make siblings similar, (3) 
timing-of-exposure comparisons to account for selection factors related to maternal 
antidepressant treatment around the time of pregnancy, and (4) paternal comparisons to 
further account for familial confounding.

 Methods
The institutional review board at Indiana University and the Regional Ethical Review Board 
in Stockholm approved this study. By Swedish law informed consent was not necessary 
because the study used data available from national registers.
Sample
We obtained a population-based dataset by linking information from the following Swedish 
registers: (1) the Multi-Generation Register, which included biological relationships for all 
individuals residing in Sweden since 1961, (2) the Prescribed Drug Register, which included 
prescription medication dispensation records since 2006, (3) the Medical Birth Register, 
which included information on 96-99% of births since 1973, (4) the National Patient 
Register, which included diagnoses from all hospital admissions since 1987 and specialist 
outpatient care since 2001, (5) the National Crime Register, which included criminal 
convictions since 1973, and (6) the Education Register, which included highest level of 
completed formal education through 2013.
Measures
Antidepressant exposure—The main exposures evaluated were first-trimester exposure 
to (1) any antidepressants (medications with Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical 
Classification [ATC] codes beginning with N06A) and (2) Selective Serotonin Reuptake 
Inhibitors (SSRIs; medications with ATC codes beginning with N06AB). Exposure was 
defined according to two sources of information: (1) maternal self-reports (available for 
offspring born between 1996 and 2012) and (2) dispensation records (available for both 
parents of offspring born between 2006 and 2012).
Information on maternal self-reported medication use during the first trimester of pregnancy 
came from the Medical Birth Register, which contains information obtained from 
standardized interviews conducted by midwives at the first antenatal visit. Medication 
reported in these interviewers is presumed to represent first-trimester use because interviews 
typically occur between week 10 and 12 of pregnancy.
Information on medication use based on dispensation records came from the Prescribed 
Drug Register, which covers all medication dispensations and accompanying prescriptions 
made in Sweden since July 2005. The only medication use not covered by the register is 
medication administered while in hospital, purchased over the counter, or obtained on the 
black market. The Prescribed Drug Register was used to obtain information on maternal 
antidepressant dispensations that covered the periods before pregnancy and during the first 
trimester of pregnancy and paternal antidepressants that covered the period during the first 
trimester of pregnancy. First-trimester exposure was defined as having at least one 
dispensation between 90 days before estimated conception and 90 days after estimated 
conception (see eFigure 1). The window included 90 days before conception because 
chronic disease medication is typically prescribed for at least 3-month periods in Sweden. 
Use before pregnancy only was defined as having at least one dispensation between 270 and

 90 days before estimated conception and no dispensations during pregnancy or during the 
180 days after delivery.
Main Outcomes—The birth outcomes were preterm birth (< 37 gestational weeks) and 
small for gestational age (birth weight < 2 SDs below the mean for gestational age). The 
neurodevelopmental outcomes were first diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, which were identified using inpatient and outpatient 
diagnoses made by specialists according to International Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision (ICD-9) and ICD-10 criteria. Previous research has validated these diagnoses in the 
Swedish registers.16,17 Participants were followed through 2013 or were censored because of 
death or emigration. More details about the registers and variables are available in previous 
publications.e.g.,18,19
Covariates—Pregnancy covariates included parity (categorized as first, second, third, or 
fourth or higher) and year of birth. Maternal and paternal covariates included country of 
birth (Sweden or outside Sweden), age at childbearing (categorized into six levels), highest 
level of completed education (categorized into seven levels), history of any criminal 
conviction, history of severe psychiatric problems (inpatient diagnosis of ICD-8, ICD-9, or 
ICD-10 schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or other non-drug-induced psychoses), and history 
of any suicide attempts (definite or uncertain). History of criminal convictions is commonly 
used in Swedish register studies to index problems with behavior regulation.e.g.,20,21
Analyses
We performed a complete-case analysis. We managed and analyzed data in SAS 9.4 and 
STATA 13.1 and calculated 95% confidence intervals based on two-sided hypothesis testing.
Descriptive statistics—We provided the distribution of covariates and outcomes in the 
whole sample and in the subsamples of exposed an unexposed offspring. In addition, we 
provided the occurrence of the outcomes and covariates in differentially exposed and 
unexposed siblings. For the birth outcomes, we presented proportions and unadjusted risk 
differences. We presented Kaplan Meier estimates of the probability of the 
neurodevelopmental diagnoses because follow-up time was censored.
Population-wide associations and within-family comparisons—Logistic 
regression was used to estimate the model-based associations for the two birth (i.e., binary 
response) outcomes. Cox proportional hazards regression (using calendar age in years as the 
timescale) was used to estimate the associations for the two neurodevelopmental outcomes 
to account for censored observations in the data. We examined the associations between 
antidepressant exposure and outcomes by estimating a sequence of three models with 
increasing degree of control for potential confounding factors. First, the baseline models 
assessed population-wide associations while only adjusting for pregnancy covariates (parity 
and year of birth). Second, the population-wide associations were further adjusted for all 
maternal and paternal covariates. These population models used robust standard errors to 
account for clustering of individuals (i.e., siblings) within nuclear families bound by the 
same biological mother. Third, sibling comparison models compared exposure and outcome

 discordant offspring within families and included covariates that could vary among siblings 
born to the same mother. By design, these models accounted for all factors that made 
siblings similar (e.g., shared genetic and early environmental influences), as well as 
measured covariates that vary within families, thereby producing a stronger test of the 
associations than the adjusted population models.22 As recommended,23 we fit fixed-effects 
models using conditional logistic and stratified Cox regression to make purely within-family 
comparisons.
Comparisons of timing of maternal use and paternal use—To explore whether 
intrauterine exposure was specifically associated with outcomes over and above maternal 
depression treatment around the time of pregnancy, we compared associations for maternal 
first-trimester antidepressant dispensations with associations for dispensations before 
pregnancy, while adjusting for measured pregnancy, maternal, and paternal covariates. We 
evaluated whether these associations differed statistically using Wald χ2 tests. We also 
compared the fit of models that included separate parameters for before pregnancy 
dispensations and first-trimester dispensations to models that included one parameter for 
both dispensation windows. In addition, paternal first-trimester antidepressant dispensations 
were used as a negative control to further explore the role of familial confounding. We first 
assessed the association between maternal and paternal first-trimester dispensations. We then 
estimated associations between paternal first-trimester antidepressant dispensations and the 
four outcomes while adjusting for the pregnancy covariates.
Sensitivity analyses—First, to evaluate the influence of exposure misclassification, we 
examined adjusted associations with five additional exposure definitions in the cohort with 
exposure information from both maternal self-reports and dispensations (i.e., the cohort born 
2006 to 2012). The four additional definitions included: (a) first-trimester exposure defined 
as use according to either self-reports or dispensation records, (b) first-trimester exposure 
defined as use according to both self-reports and dispensation records, (c) a narrower first-
trimester dispensation window of 30 days before conception to 90 days after conception, and 
(d) at least two dispensations during the original first-trimester exposure window. Second, 
given that single-offspring families cannot contribute to sibling-comparison analyses, we 
reassessed the population models in the subsample of offspring with siblings to evaluate the 
generalizability of sibling-comparison results. Third, to assess if exposure to other 
psychotropic medications confounded the associations, we restricted the analyses to 
offspring not exposed to other psychotropic medications. Fourth, given that prior to 2001 
outpatient psychiatric diagnoses were not included in the National Patient Register, we 
conducted analyses on a subsample of offspring born after 2000 to assess whether left 
censoring of the neurodevelopmental outcomes biased the findings. These analyses also 
enabled us to explore whether cohort effects influenced the results. Fifth, we estimated the 
associations with the neurodevelopmental outcomes in subsamples excluding offspring with 
diagnoses before age 2 to address concerns about the validity of early neurodevelopmental 
diagnoses. Sixth, because the main analyses focused on first-trimester exposure, we 
examined the association between dispensations during the second and/or third trimester and 
each outcome in the subsample of offspring whose mothers had a dispensation during the 
first trimester.

 Results
The target sample included 1,670,237 offspring born 1996-2012. Multiple births (48,979 
offspring), cases with missing father identifier (16,295), missing or invalid responses on 
covariates (20,118), and missing on the small for gestational age variable (4,216) were 
sequentially dropped. The final analytic cohort of 1,580,629 offspring (48.6% female) 
represented 95% of target singleton births and included 943,776 distinct mothers and 
946,579 distinct fathers. According to maternal self-reports, 22,544 (1.4%) of the offspring 
in the final cohort were exposed to any antidepressant during the first trimester, and of these, 
82% (18,470) were exposed to SSRIs.
The timing of exposure and paternal comparisons were conducted on the subsample of 
708,450 offspring (born between 2006 and 2012) with dispensation-based exposure data. 
There were 26,477 (3.7%) offspring with first-trimester maternal antidepressant 
dispensations. Of these, 84% (22,125) had first-trimester maternal SSRI dispensations 
specifically. There were 8,203 (1.2%) offspring who had mothers with antidepressant 
dispensations before pregnancy only. Of these, 81% (6,674) had mothers who were 
specifically dispensed SSRIs before pregnancy. There were 18,727 (2.6%) offspring who 
had fathers with first-trimester antidepressant dispensations. Of these, 72% (13,521) had 
fathers with first-trimester SSRI dispensations specifically.
The same pattern of results was observed for associations with first-trimester exposure to 
any antidepressant as first-trimester exposure to SSRIs specifically. Therefore, results for 
exposure to any antidepressant are presented in the text and tables. The results for SSRIs can 
be found in the tables and online supplement.
Descriptive Statistics Stratified By Maternal Self-reported Antidepressant Use
In the whole sample, 7.0% of exposed and 4.8% of unexposed offspring were preterm (Table 
1), which equates to 220 (95% CI [187, 254]) additional preterm birth cases per 10,000 
offspring. Approximately 2.5% of exposed and 2.2% of unexposed offspring were born 
small for gestational age, (risk difference = 35 additional cases per 10,000 offspring; 95% CI 
[14, 56]). Compared to unexposed offspring, exposed offspring also had a higher probability 
of the neurodevelopmental diagnoses (see Figure 1a and 1c for the Kaplan Meier estimates 
and confidence intervals). For example, by age 15, Kaplan Meier estimates indicated a 
cumulative risk of autism spectrum disorder of 5.3% for exposed and 2.1% for unexposed 
offspring. By age 15, the cumulative risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was 
12.6% for exposed and 5.5% for unexposed offspring. See eSupplement A for more 
descriptive information.
Among differentially exposed siblings, 6.2% of exposed and 5.1% of unexposed siblings 
were born preterm. However, 1.9% of exposed and 2.0% of unexposed siblings were small 
for gestational age. See Figure 1b and 1d for the probabilities of the neurodevelopmental 
diagnoses among differentially exposed siblings through age 15. By age 15, the cumulative 
risk for autism spectrum disorder was 5.5% for exposed and 4.6% for unexposed siblings; 
the cumulative risk for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was 12.4% for exposed and 
12.7% for unexposed siblings.

 Population-wide Associations and Sibling Comparisons
In the baseline models (Table 2), maternal self-reported first-trimester antidepressant use 
was associated with preterm birth (OR = 1.5, 95% CI [1.4, 1.6]), small for gestational age 
(OR = 1.2, 95% CI [1.1, 1.3]), autism spectrum disorder (HR = 2.0, 95% CI [1.8, 2.3]), and 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (HR = 2.2, 95% CI [2.0, 2.4]). In the adjusted 
models, first-trimester exposure to antidepressants was also statistically significantly 
associated with all outcomes (preterm birth OR = 1.4, 95% CI [1.3, 1.4]; small for 
gestational age OR = 1.1, 95% CI [1.0, 1.2]; autism spectrum disorder HR = 1.6, 95% CI 
[1.5, 1.8]; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder HR = 1.6, 95% CI [1.5, 1.7]).
In the sibling comparison models, first-trimester exposure was associated with preterm birth 
(OR = 1.3, 95% CI [1.2, 1.5], p < 0.0001). However, it was not associated with small for 
gestational age (OR = 1.0, 95% CI [0.8, 1.3]), autism spectrum disorder (HR = 0.8, 95% CI 
[0.6, 1.1]), or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (HR = 1.0, 95% CI [0.8, 1.3]). See 
eSupplement A for information on offspring who could contribute to sibling comparison 
analyses.
Comparisons of Timing of Maternal Use and Paternal Use
Dispensation data was used in timing of exposure and paternal comparisons (see 
eSupplement B for more information). For preterm birth, the association with maternal 
dispensations before pregnancy but not during or after pregnancy (OR = 1.2, 95% CI [1.1, 
1.3]; Table 3) was statistically significantly weaker than the association with first-trimester 
maternal dispensations (OR = 1.4, 95% CI [1.3, 1.5]). For all other outcomes, the 
associations with maternal dispensations before but not during or after pregnancy did not 
statistically significantly differ from the associations with first-trimester maternal 
dispensations.
Paternal first-trimester antidepressant dispensations were associated with maternal first-
trimester antidepressant dispensations (OR = 3.4, 95% CI [3.3, 3.6]). Paternal first-trimester 
antidepressant dispensations (Table 4) had very modest associations with preterm birth (OR 
= 1.1, 95% CI [1.1, 1.2]) and small for gestational age (OR = 1.1, 95% CI [1.0, 1.2]), with 
the latter not being statistically significant. Paternal dispensations during pregnancy were 
associated with autism spectrum disorder (HR = 1.3, 95% CI [1.1, 1.6]), and attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (HR = 1.7, 95% CI [1.4, 2.2]).
Sensitivity Analyses
Sensitivity analyses showed a consistent pattern of results across analyses using stricter 
criteria for exposure and narrower exposure windows, suggesting that exposure 
misclassification was not responsible for the pattern of findings (eSupplement C). Results 
from population models conducted on a subsample that excluded offspring who did not have 
siblings also were essentially identical to the main results (eSupplement D). These results 
provide support for the generalizability of sibling comparison results. Sensitivity analyses 
also suggested that confounding by exposure to other psychotropic medications 
(eSupplement E); left censoring of the neurodevelopmental outcomes and cohort effects 
(eSupplement F); and measurement error of the neurodevelopmental outcomes

 (eSupplement G) had very little influence on the results. In addition, among offspring whose 
mothers had a dispensation during the first trimester, a dispensation during the second or 
third trimester was associated with increased risk of the pregnancy outcomes, though the 
associations with the neurodevelopmental diagnoses were not statistically significant 
(eSupplement H).
Discussion
The present study found that, after accounting for measured pregnancy, maternal, and 
paternal traits, as well as all (unmeasured) stable familial characteristics shared by siblings, 
maternal antidepressant use during the first trimester of pregnancy, compared to no 
exposure, was associated with a small increased risk of preterm birth but no increased risk of 
small for gestational age, autism spectrum disorder, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder. That is, unexposed siblings were at equal risk for small for gestational age, autism 
spectrum disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder as their exposed siblings. 
These results are consistent with the hypothesis that genetic and/or familial environmental 
factors account for the population-wide associations between first-trimester antidepressant 
exposure and these outcomes. Moreover, results from analyses examining timing of 
exposure were consistent with the interpretation of the sibling-comparison findings. 
Specifically, the strength of the associations between antidepressant dispensations before 
pregnancy and small for gestational age, autism spectrum disorder, and attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder did not statistically significantly differ from that of associations for 
first-trimester antidepressant dispensations, suggesting that the underlying condition, rather 
than exposure to antidepressants during the first trimester, explained the associations. 
Paternal first-trimester antidepressant dispensations were also associated with the 
neurodevelopmental disorders. Because paternal antidepressant use during the first trimester 
is unlikely to contribute to intrauterine exposure, these findings provide further support that 
associations between first-trimester antidepressant exposure and offspring 
neurodevelopmental problems may, at least partially, be explained by familial confounding.
The results also showed that, across multiple designs that account for familial confounding 
factors, first-trimester antidepressant exposure was associated with a slightly elevated risk of 
preterm birth. Although these results may be consistent with the hypothesis that prenatal 
antidepressant exposure could lead to a small increased risk of preterm birth, other possible 
explanations for the findings need to be considered. Most important, the potential role of 
confounding by maternal depression should be noted because both the existence and severity 
of depression symptoms in the mother could potentially influence the risk of preterm birth.24
The results of the population-wide models were consistent with numerous observational 
studies that have demonstrated associations between prenatal antidepressant exposure and 
birth and neurodevelopmental problems.2–7 The results of the sibling comparisons were also 
consistent with the limited previous sibling-comparisons studies that have examined 
associations between prenatal antidepressant exposure and birth and neurodevelopmental 
problems. A sibling comparison study using dispensation data from the Swedish registers 
found a statistically significant associations between prenatal antidepressant dispensations 
and shorter gestation.25 Another sibling comparison reported that prenatal antidepressant

 exposure was not associated with autism spectrum disorder,26 although confidence intervals 
were too wide to draw strong conclusions.
The current study had several strengths. First, the study analyzed a large, population-based 
sample, which provided statistical power to examine rare-yet-serious outcomes. Second, the 
conclusions were based on converging evidence from multiple research designs that 
accounted for both measured and unmeasured confounding factors. Third, first-trimester 
antidepressant use was indexed by both maternal self-report and dispensations. Fourth, the 
study included four outcomes, two pregnancy-related and two neurodevelopmental 
problems, all of which are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Fifth, 
sensitivity analyses suggested that misclassification of antidepressant use, several 
assumptions of sibling-comparison analyses, confounding by other psychotropic 
medications, and misclassification of the neurodevelopmental problems were unlikely to 
influence the overall conclusions.
The findings from the present study should be considered in light of several limitations. 
First, and most important, observational designs such as these cannot fully rule out all 
sources of confounding. In particular, like other register-based approaches,26 this study 
could not comprehensively assess maternal depression or its severity,27 nor could it compare 
different antidepressant treatment regimes. Thus, associations could have been influenced by 
confounding by antidepressant indication. In order to address this limitation, the study used 
multiple designs, each of which could help rule out some but not all sources of confounding, 
to provide complementary evidence. For example, sibling comparisons ruled out all stable 
confounders (e.g., chronic maternal depression), but that design may not have been able to 
account for confounding from maternal depression that varied across pregnancies.28 Thus, 
the within-family associations with preterm birth may plausibly be driven by unmeasured 
time-varying maternal depression rather than by antidepressant use.29
Second, this study focused on first-trimester exposure. Whereas one recent study found an 
association between antidepressant dispensations late—but not early—in pregnancy and 
autism spectrum disorder,3 there has been considerable debate regarding the role of timing.
30–32 In fact, several studies have found stronger associations with first-trimester 
antidepressant use than with use later in pregnancy.4,6 Supplemental analyses indicated that 
among offspring whose mothers had a dispensation during the first trimester, a dispensation 
during the second or third trimester was associated with greater risk of offspring being born 
preterm and small for gestational age. These associations could be due to intrauterine 
exposure to antidepressants later in pregnancy, increased severity of depression (i.e., 
confounding by indication), or other unmeasured confounding. Future studies are, therefore, 
needed to explicitly examine whether timing of exposure moderates the preterm birth 
association or whether exposure later in pregnancy is more strongly associated with other 
outcomes.
Third, the vast majority of antidepressant exposure (82% according to maternal reports) was 
to SSRIs. Future research should explore class- and drug-specific associations. Fourth, 
analyses were conducted on a Swedish sample, and it is not known if results would 
generalize to other countries. Although the population-wide associations in the present study

 were commensurate with those from other countries, future research should use designs that 
help account for unmeasured confounders to explore associations with prenatal 
antidepressant exposure in the United States and elsewhere. Fifth, sibling comparisons 
require large samples to have adequate statistical power.33 Although the large Swedish 
sample ensured fairly precise parameter estimates in sibling comparisons, small effects of 
antidepressant exposure cannot be ruled out. However, their magnitudes, particularly for the 
neurodevelopmental outcomes, would be much smaller than those suggested by population-
wide associations.
Conclusion
Among offspring born in Sweden, after accounting for confounding factors, first-trimester 
exposure to antidepressants, compared to no exposure, was associated with a small increased 
risk of preterm birth but no increased risk of small for gestational age, autism spectrum 
disorder, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

 Key Points
Question
Is first-trimester maternal antidepressant use related to offspring birth and/or 
neurodevelopmental problems?
Findings
In this retrospect cohort study of 1,580,629 Swedish offspring using multiple statistical 
and methodical approaches to adjust for confounding, first-trimester antidepressant 
exposure was significantly associated with preterm birth (OR = 1.3 in a sibling 
comparison analysis) but not with risk of being born small for gestational age or later 
autism spectrum disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
Meaning
After accounting for confounding factors, first-trimester antidepressant exposure, 
compared with no exposure, was associated with a small increased risk of preterm birth 
but no increased risk of small for gestational age, autism spectrum disorder, or attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

 Figure 1. Risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder by 
Maternal Self-reported First-trimester Exposure
The figure shows Kaplan-Meier estimates of cumulative risk (i.e., proportion diagnosed 
with) the neurodevelopmental outcomes (y-axis) by age (x-axis) among offspring with and 
without maternal self-reported first-trimester antidepressant exposure. The blue line shows 
exposed offspring. The black line shows unexposed offspring. Shaded areas around the blue 
and black lines are pointwise 95% confidence intervals. Top panels (A and B) show risk for 
autism spectrum disorder. Bottom panels (C and D) show risk for attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder. Left panels (A and C) include the full cohort. Right panels (B and D) 
include siblings discordant for first-trimester antidepressant exposure. The median and 
interquartile range (IQR) follow-up time in the study (i.e., age since birth in years) were 
estimated separately for each exposure group. The median follow-up for autism spectrum 
disorder in the full cohort was 8.71 y [IQR: (4.69, 13.19)] for the unexposed group, and 5.82 
y [IQR: (3.32, 9.08)] for the exposed group. The median follow-up for autism spectrum 
disorder in the sample of discordant siblings was 9.24 y [IQR: (5.54, 12.96)] for the 
unexposed group, and 6.27 y [IQR: (3.77, 9.02)] for the exposed group. The median follow-
up for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in the full cohort was 8.54 y [IQR: (4.54, 
13.54)] for the unexposed group, and 5.54 y [IQR: (3.54, 9.54)] for the exposed group. The 
median follow-up for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in the sample of discordant

OR = odds ratio. HR = hazard ratio. CI = confidence interval. All models were fit in a sample of 708,450 offspring. Models controlled for parity 
and year of birth. Analyses compared offspring of fathers with first trimester antidepressant dispensations to offspring of fathers who were not 
dispensed antidepressants before pregnancy, during the second and third trimester of pregnancy, and after pregnancy (eFigure 1 shows dispensation 
windows).
