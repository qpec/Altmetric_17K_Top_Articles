Rising global temperatures are causing increases in the frequency and severity of extreme climatic events, such
as floods, droughts, and heat waves. We analyze changes in summer temperatures, the frequency, severity, and
duration of heat waves, and heat-related mortality in India between 1960 and 2009 using data from the India
Meteorological Department. Mean temperatures across India have risen by more than 0.5°C over this period,
with statistically significant increases in heat waves. Using a novel probabilistic model, we further show that the
increase in summer mean temperatures in India over this period corresponds to a 146% increase in the prob-
ability of heat-related mortality events of more than 100 people. In turn, our results suggest that future climate
warming will lead to substantial increases in heat-related mortality, particularly in developing low-latitude
countries, such as India, where heat waves will become more frequent and populations are especially vulner-
able to these extreme temperatures. Our findings indicate that even moderate increases in mean temperatures
may cause great increases in heat-related mortality and support the efforts of governments and international
organizations to build up the resilience of these vulnerable regions to more severe heat waves.
INTRODUCTION
Global mean temperatures are expected to increase by as much as 5.5°C
by the end of this century (1), which is, in turn, expected to increase the
intensity of heat waves around the world (2–4), with the largest relative
effect on summer temperatures in developing regions, such as Africa,
South America, Middle East, and South Asia (5). The impact of these
heat waves on human and natural systems include decreased air quality,
diminished crop yields, increased energy consumption, increased
evapotranspiration, intensification of droughts, and—perhaps most
concerning of all—direct effects on human health (6, 7). Heat stress dur-
ing periods of high temperatures may also exacerbate health problems,
suchascardiovascularandrespiratory diseases,and cause life-threatening
crises (8, 9). Certain segments of the population, such as the young, el-
derly, and poor, may therefore be especially susceptible to this health
impact due to existing health conditions and lack of basic resources,
such as clean drinking water, shelter, access to air conditioning, and
health care (10). Populations without central air conditioning tend to
have higher heat-related mortality rates (11).
In light of geographical patterns of warming and vulnerable popula-
tions, we present here an analysis of a half-century (1960–2009) of tem-
perature, heat waves, and related mortality in India. Previous studies
report that between 1971 and 2007, there was an increase of more than
0.5°C in mean temperatures across India (12), and the projected annual
spatial warming in India will be between 2.2° and 5.5°C by the end of the
21st century, with higher projections over northern, central, and western
India(13,14).OnthebasisofdatafromtheWorldBank,ofthe1.24billion
people living in India in 2011 (18% of global population), an estimated
23.6% earned <$1.25 per day and ~25% did not have any access to elec-
tricity, makingthemespecially vulnerable to the impactof heatwaves(15).
This vulnerability has been made clear by events in recent years: Heat
waves in 2010 killed more than 1300 people in the city of Ahmedabad
alone, prompting the start of efforts to develop coordinated Heat Action
Plans (16). However, these efforts remain limited and localized, and, in
2013 and 2015, the country experienced another bout of intense heat
waves that killed more than 1500 and 2500 people across the country,
respectively. Since then,there havebeen severalmore deadly heatwaves,
including the most intense Indian heat wave in recorded history in May
of 2016 when maximum temperatures in Jaisalmer reached 52.4°C.
Heat waves are usually described as successive hot days (4, 17) and
are often defined on a percentile basis (6). Here, we consider heat waves
to be three or more consecutive days of temperatures above the 85th
percentile of the hottest month for each specific location. Figure S1
shows the heat wave threshold values across India (85th percentile of
hottestmonth’smean temperaturein °C).ForeachwarmseasoninIndia
(April to September) from 1960 to 2009, we assess four different heat
wave properties: (i) accumulated heat wave intensity, (ii) annual heat
wave count, (iii) mean heat wave duration, and (iv) heat wave days.
The annual heat wave count and mean duration are simply the number
of heat wave events that occur each year and their average duration in
days, respectively. Heat wave days are the product of heat wave count
and duration and represent the number of days under heat wave con-
ditions. We evaluate accumulated heat wave intensity as the cumulative
cooling degree day (CDD), or the sum of the daily mean temperature
during a heat wave subtracted by 22°C, over the entire heat wave event
[that is, (daily temperature in°C − 22°C) × duration in days]. We per-
form our heat wave analyses based on summermean temperatures (that
is, the average of mean daily temperatures during summer) because we
believe this to be a better indicator of accumulated heat stress. However,
we also provide analyses based on summer maximum temperatures in
the Supplementary Materials.These analyses are performed using 1° × 1°
daily temperature records from the India Meteorological Department.
Finally, we use the results from these retrospective analyses to develop a
conditional probabilistic model of the relationships among summer

apply to estimate the probability distribution of heat-related mortality
related to mean climate warming in the future. Further details of our
analytic approach are provided in Methods.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 1A shows that summer mean temperatures have increased
substantially from 1960 to 2009. The time series exhibits a statistically
significant (95% confidence interval) upward trend confirmed using
the Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test. The accumulated intensity, count,
duration, and days of Indian heat waves have also increased over the
analyzed time period over most of the country and especially in the
northern, southern, and western parts of India (Fig. 1, B to E).
The red shading that dominates most of the maps in Fig. 1 indicates
that the observed increases are widespread and strong: Southern and
western India experienced 50% more heat wave events during the pe-
riod 1985–2009 than during the previous 25-year period (calculated by
dividing the difference in the number of events from 1985 to 2009 rel-
ative to 1960 to 1984 by the total number of events). Similarly, heat wave
days and the mean duration of heat waves have increased by approxi-
mately 25% in the majority of India. Figure S2 shows the same analysis
for heat waves calculated using summer maximum temperatures. Fig-
ure S3 shows the mean values for each heat wave characteristic from
1960 to 1984 and 1985 to 2009 separately. Figure S4 shows the areas
where there was a statistically significant trend confirmed by the MK
trend test.
Figure 2A shows the relationships among standardized values of
summer mean temperatures, heat wave days, and annual heat-related
mortality occurring over the period 1967–2007 (the period for which
reliable mortality data were available; see the Supplementary Materials
for details). Although high summer mean temperatures often corre-
spond to spikes in deaths, the correlation of temperatures to deaths is
weaker (Pearson’s linear correlation = 63%, r2 = 0.38; Fig. 2B) than the
correlation to the number of heat wave days each year (Pearson’s linear
correlation = 77%, r2 = 0.58; Fig. 2C), especially in the years when there
were high mortality rates.
In an effort to understand the underlying mechanisms of heat wave
mortality,wefurtherexploreditsrelationshipwithpopulationandincome
levels in India. Figure 3 shows that the relationship between population-
weighted heat wave days and mortality rates is only slightly better than
that between mortality and summer mean temperatures (Pearson’s

trend test (A). The (B) accumulated heat wave intensity, (C) number of heat wave events, (D) heat wave duration, and (E) heat wave days during the latter period (1985–2009)
has also increased over most areas of India relative to the previous period of 1960–1984.

 linear correlation = 67%, r2 = 0.44; Fig. 3B); however, the correlation
between income-weighted heat wave days and mortality rates is better
(Pearson’s linear correlation = 77%, r2 = 0.58; Fig. 3C).
On the basis of these correlations, we infer that the relationship be-
tween income and human health is stronger than that between physical
conditions and health, perhaps as the result of access to air conditioning
or medical care. It is known that some highly populated regions have
low income per capita (for example, northern India), and many rural
low-populated regions also have low income per capita (that is, central
and eastern India), which we show in fig. S5.
Figure 2A highlights several years—1972, 1988, 1998, and 2003—in
which there were more than 10 heat wave days on average across India,
with corresponding spikes in heat-related mass mortality of between
650 and 1500 people. However, there are a few years, such as 1973,
1983, 1984, and 1995, in which there were an above-average number
of income-weighted heat wave days but a low number of deaths. A pos-
sible explanation for this is that the areas where these latter heat waves
occurred tended to be less populous and/or wealthier regions (see fig.
S5). These observations reinforce previous work that highlighted pov-
erty as a significant factor in climate-induced mortality, such as heat
wave deaths (18).
Figure 4 shows the results of a conditional probability density
analysis (see Methods) of annual mortality, given certain thresholds
for summer mean temperatures and heat wave days. The shaded re-
gion represents the probability of mass heat-related mortality (that is,
heat-related deaths of more than 100 people), given different summer
temperature values. For example, Fig. 4A shows that there is 13% prob-
ability that years with summer mean temperatures equal to 27°C will
result to mass heat-related mortality. However, with an increase in
summer mean temperatures of just 0.5°C (to 27.5°C), the probability
of these levels of heat-related deaths jumps by a factor of 2.5 to 32%.
Figure S6 shows a similar relationship with summer maximum tem-
peratures. Similarly, Fig. 3B shows that the probability of heat-related
mass mortality events increases from 46 to 82% (78% increase)
when the average number of heat wave days across India shifts from
6 to 8 days, respectively. The substantial increase in mortality rates due
to either a 0.5°C increase in summer mean temperature or two more
heat wave days suggests that future climate warming could have a rel-
atively drastic human toll in India and similarly in developing tropical
and subtropical countries. Meanwhile, some experts expect India’s
temperature to rise from 2.2° to 5.5°C (13, 14).
By almost all measures, heat waves have increased markedly across
India over the past half-century and, with this, the incidence of heat-
related mortality. Projected increases in global mean temperatures un-
der a range of climate change scenarios can be expected to extend these
trends. Although India is particularly susceptible to heat waves given its
geography and current state of human development, there are many
countries that are similarly vulnerable to the extreme heat events in
the ever-warming world. Our results suggest that even moderate and
practically unavoidable increases in mean temperatures, such as 0.5°C,
may lead to large increases in heat-related mortality, unless measures are
taken to substantially improve the resilience of vulnerable populations.
METHODS
Temperature and mortality data
Daily temperature data based on 395 weather stations and interpolated
at 1° × 1°spatial resolution was obtained from the India Meteorological
Fig. 2. Standardized number of heat wave days, summer mean tempera-
tures, and heat-related mortality. Standardized trends show the correspon-
dence among the three variables. In years when heat wave days (yellow) and
summer mean temperature (red) are above average, heat-related deaths also
spike upward.

weighted heat wave days, and heat-related mortality. Standardized trends
show the correspondence among the three variables. In most years when income-
weighted heat waves (light green) and population-weighted heat waves (dark
green) are above average, heat-related deaths also increase markedly.

 Department (19). Mortality data were also obtained from the India Me-
teorological Department and from annual reports, which compiled
information from newspaper and other sources about mortality dur-
ing specific extreme heat events (20).
Statistical methods
This paper used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to analyze the
changes in distribution functions of heat waves in different periods.
We used the two-sample KS test to analyze the differences between
the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) for the number of heat
waves. This study compared the different types of heat waves that
occurred in 1985–2009 relative to those in 1960–1984. The KS test is
a nonparametric test that evaluates whether there is a statistically signif-
icant change between two distributions by calculating the largest dis-
tance between their empirical distributions. The null hypothesis is
that the data sets come from the same distribution at a certain confi-
dence interval (95% confidence interval in this study).
The KS test determines changes in empirical distribution functions
by comparing pre- and postchange samples, defined as

The KS test statistic is the maximum difference between two empir-
ical distributions

Larger divergence values (Dt,n) represent greater changes in the
cumulative distributions (21, 22).
The MK trend test analyzes whether there is a statistically signif-
icant trend (95% confidence interval) in the number of heat waves
per year time series. The MK test is a nonparametric test that uses
the empirical ranks of time series and is widely used in hydrology and
climatology (23).
Here, we used the r2 measure to determine how close the mor-
tality and heat wave characteristics data are to their respective fitted
regression lines. The r2 statistic measures the proportion of variance
in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent
variable. Lower r2 values depict the fact that the dependent variable
(mortality) cannot be predicted from the independent variable (heat
wave days), and higher values portray the fact that the dependent
variable can be predicted with little to no error from the independent
variable (24).
Calculation of conditional probabilities
To derive the conditional probabilities presented in Fig. 4, we used the
multivariate copula functions (25–28) to find the joint probability
distribution of mortality and summer mean temperatures across India.
We fitted the Frank copula and t copula families to the summer mean
temperatures and mortality, and heat wave days and mortality data,
respectively, because they have the highest statistically significant (95%
confidence interval) maximum likelihood among all the copula fam-
ilies. Maximum likelihood and P values for five major copula families
with respect to summer mean temperatures and heat wave days rela-
tive to mortality are shown in table S1. A copula function is defined as
the multivariate distribution function (29, 30)

where C is the CDF of the copula and FXiðxiÞ is the nonexceedance
probability of xi (marginal distribution). Here, we used the bivariate

variables and probability of mass mortality events is shown in (C).

To determine the conditional probabilities of mortality rates

(X = x1, x2,…), that is, FY|X(Y > y | X), we developed the conditional

where c is the PDF of the copula function and fY(y) is the mortality

perature conditional PDF from Eq. 3, the probability of the mortality
rates (Y) exceeding a particular threshold (y) is given by the area
under the curve fY|X(y | x). This allowed the calculation of conditional
PDF fY|X(y | x) for different values of x (for example, summer mean
temperatures = 27°C or heat wave days = 6 in Fig. 4).
