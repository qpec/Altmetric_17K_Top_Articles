Vaccination is the most powerful way to prevent human beings from contracting infectious diseases 
including viruses. In the case of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, an unexpectedly novel disease 
entity, HPV vaccination associated neuro-immunopathetic syndrome (HANS), has been reported and 
remains to be carefully verified. To elucidate the mechanism of HANS, we applied a strategy similar to 
the active experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) model - one of the most popular animal models 
used to induce maximum immunological change in the central nervous system. Surprisingly, mice 
vaccinated with pertussis toxin showed neurological phenotypes that include low responsiveness of the 
tail reflex and locomotive mobility. Pathological analyses revealed the damage to the hypothalamus 
and circumventricular regions around the third ventricle, and these regions contained apoptotic 
vascular endothelial cells. These data suggested that HPV-vaccinated donners that are susceptible to 
the HPV vaccine might develop HANS under certain environmental factors. These results will give us the 
new insight into the murine pathological model of HANS and help us to find a way to treat of patients 
suffering from HANS.
There is a long history of the fight between human beings and invasive bacteria and viruses. In the 19th century, 
Edward Jenner successfully developed and administrated the first vaccine to humans to protect against smallpox. 
In the 20th century Walther Fleming’s discovery of penicillin, made it possible to directly kill bacteria. These two 
therapeutic developments have not only given us a way to prevent and treat infectious diseases, but have also led 
to a tremendous improvement in human welfare.
Cervical cancer is the most common type of cancer in women and is the cancer associated with the most 
death in women aged younger than 44. Because infection with human papilloma viruses (HPVs) is necessary for 
the occurrence of cervical cancer, protection from HPV is effective in avoiding the disease1,2. There are 40 types 
of HPVs which can infect anogenital epithelium in humans, and 15 types of the virus are associated with cervi-
cal cancer3,4. In general, vaccine is designated to prevent against infectious diseases. To prevent HPV infection, 
two prophylactic vaccines have been developed; a quadrivalent vaccine (Gardasil®; Merck & Co., USA) against 
L1-like virus particles to HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 185, and a bivalent HPV vaccine (Cervarix®; Glaxo Smith Kline, 
London) against types 16 and 18, which are thought to be the most frequent of the 15 types associated with cer-
vical cancer. Clinical trials revealed both Gardasil and Cervarix to be safe and effective against cervical cancer6;

thus, the two vaccines were introduced for administration in 2006 with approximately 175 million doses being 
distributed worldwide since then.
Like Janus’ mirror, however, immunization and vaccination have two different aspects and some kinds of 
strongly evoked immune reactions are thought to result in significant adverse reactions. For example, a few cases 
have determined vaccine to be the cause of abnormal and dysregulated host-reactions, resulting in such as systemic 
fever, local pain at the injection site, Guillain-Barré syndrome-like neurological deficit, and autoimmune-like 
symptoms and so on. To evoke a full- and adequate immunological reaction, vaccines include aluminum adju-
vant in addition to virus-like particles as antigens. Chronic stimulation of the immune system by adjuvants can 
result in an autoimmune disease characterized by myalgia, arthralgia, chronic fatigue, and neurological man-
ifestations - appropriately named the autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA)7,8. 
According to the HPV vaccination, there are two recent well-documented review articles. Palmieri B. et al  
reported the occurrence of severe somatoform and dysautonomic syndromes after HPV vaccination9 and Brinth L. et al. 
 
also described the onset of autonomic dysfunction after the quadrivalent vaccination10. Both reviews clearly 
indicated the presence of unique adverse reactions associated with the HPV vaccination including headache, 
fatigue, depression, cognitive dysfunctions, uncontrollable and involuntary movement, and limb weakness. For 
these clinical manifestations, we have coined these reactions as human papillomavirus vaccination-associated 
neuro-immunopathic syndrome (HANS) and proposed diagnostic criteria. HANS syndrome is thought to con-
sist of four clinical domains; (i) autonomic, endocrine and inflammatory symptoms; (ii) cognitive and emotional 
symptoms; (iii) environmental hypersensitivity and pain symptoms and (iv) locomotion and motor symp-
toms11,12. Several clinical studies on HANS symptoms have also shown that the HPV vaccines may influence the 
central nervous system (CNS)10,13–15.
In this study, to better understand the molecular mechanisms of HANS, we first attempt to establish an animal 
model of the syndrome. We then analyzed the pathological lesions of the murine HANS model by focusing on 
the CNS.
Results
HPV vaccine Administration. 
To assess the neurophysiological effects of the HPV vaccine, forty eight 
female mice were either immunized with Gardasil or given phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as a control (Fig. 1-a). 
Pertussis toxin (Ptx) was administrated subsequent to the vaccination to facilitate the access of the vaccine to the 
CNS via modulation of the blood-brain barrier (BBB)16. As a control for autoimmune encephalomyelitis, myelin 
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)35-55 was used17. Administration of PBS or Ptx had no effect (group 1, 2), 
and disruption of BBB by Ptx itself was confirmed to have no effect. Mice in group 5 and 6 belonged to the exper-
imental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) groups. Mice in the group 6 that had received MOG and Ptx showed 
paralyzed tails within 2 weeks, and various neurological symptoms, such as hind limb paresis after 3 weeks. Mice 
in the group 5, had received MOG without toxin administration, also revealed neurological symptoms, which 
was advanced more slowly than group 6 as reported previously18. Mice in group 3 and 4 belonged to the Gardasil 
treatment groups. After a third injection of the vaccine (4 weeks from first immunization), three out of 16 mice 
in group 4, which were treated with Gardasil and Ptx, presented the tail with reduced tension and significantly 
weakness movement (Fig. 1-b). Motor disability was graded by use of an EAE score (scale, 0–6)19. Although the 
symptomatic severity varied, over 50% of mice (12/21) showed similar motor dysfunctions, including tail drop as 
shown in Fig. 1-a, over the course of the study. Two of the 14 mice with sequential immunization with Gardasil 
alone administration (group 3) exhibited milder motor dysfunctions compared with the combined treatment 
group with Gardasil and Ptx (Fig. 1-b,c). We confirmed the behavior of these mice by horizontal bar test and 
Kondziela’s inverted screen test20,21. Significant decrease of motor coordination was observed in the combined 
treatment group with Gardasil and Ptx, compared to control group. By contrast, there were no differences in the 
muscular strength between these groups, (Supplemental Figure 1). Altogether, these results suggest that com-
bined administration of HPV vaccine and Ptx could induce the damage to the murine CNS.
Pathological analyses. 
For further investigation of the neuropathological lesions associated with HPV vac-
cination, histological analyses of the brain were performed. Overall, the groups exhibited no differences in brain 
size or weight. Serial brain dissections were obtained 12 weeks after the first immunization, and they underwent 
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and Klüver-Barrera (KB) staining. H&E staining revealed contracted third 
ventricles in mice treated with Gardasil and Ptx (Fig. 2-a upper). On the other hand, mice that had undergone 
EAE, showing paralysis of the tail and hind limbs, did not appear to have narrowed third ventricles. Similarly, 
treatment with Ptx or Gardasil alone did not lead to third ventricular stenosis. Morphological differences were 
also not detected in the cerebellum, spinal cord, cortex among vehicle of mice treated with Gardasil alone, Ptx 
and Gardasil with Ptx (Group 1, 2, 3 and 4). Serial sections of the forebrains from mice treated with Gardasil and 
Ptx were stained and revealed that the third ventricle was remarkably narrowed over a wide range of the forebrain 
from anterior to posterior portion (Fig. 2-b). Together, our analyses suggest that treatment with HPV vaccine 
could affect the ventricular size and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure.
To confirm the relationship between effects of HPV vaccine on motor function and histological changes, 
differences around the third ventricle were compared among mice treated with Gardasil and Ptx. In the 
vaccine-treated group, the third ventricle was narrowed in all mice showing tail drops. Additionally, the extent of 
third ventricle narrowing seemed to be corresponding with the severity of disruptions to tail tonus (Fig. 2-d). In 
H&E staining of the paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei (PVN), the dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei (DMH) 
and the arcuate nuclei from mice treated with Gardasil and Ptx, indicated less stained nuclei than mice in other 
groups (Fig. 2-b,d). KB staining of the same structure also revealed a decrease in the number of nuclei and Nissl 
bodies (Fig. 2-c,d). In addition, we confirmed effects on the inflammation by HPV vaccine and Ptx. The filtration 
of lymphocytes into forebrain was not observed (Fig. 2-b).

Induction of Apoptosis in the Circumventricular Regions. 
The decrease in the number of cells led 
us to assess the association between HPV vaccination and apoptosis in the forebrain. In order to do this, we 
performed the TUNEL assay on sections of the forebrain. In sections obtained from vehicle- and Ptx-treated 
animals, we found a limited number of TUNEL-positive cells with labelled nuclei - confirming that Ptx alone did 
not induce apoptosis. Meanwhile, greater numbers of TUNEL-positive cells were found in the thalamus and the 
hypothalamus obtained mice treated with Gardasil and Ptx (Fig. 3). In fact, seven times more TUNEL-positive 
cells were observed in mice treated Gardasil and Ptx, while four times more apoptotic cells were found in mice 
treated with Gardasil alone than that apoptotic cells in vehicle mice. In particular, the number of labelled cells 
was greater around the third ventricle and at the vessels in PVN and DMH. Together, these data support an asso-
ciation between apoptosis and the damage to murine neural structures caused administration of HPV vaccine 
and Ptx.
Identification of Apoptotic Cells. 
Next, we sought to determine which types of cells were affected by 
apoptosis. Since apoptotic cells were observed around vessels, we labeled sections using markers for vascular 
endothelial cells, pericytes and astrocytes. CD31-expressing cells were consistent with apoptotic cells bound to 
vessels (Fig. 4), while cells expressing NG2- or GFAP were not stained. There results indicate that the HPV vac-
cine induced vascular endothelial cell apoptosis.

Neurotransmission in circumventricular regions. 
Finally, for further the understanding of neuronal 
damage in combined administration of HPV vaccine and Ptx mice, we assessed the interneuron subtypes in cir-
cumventricular regions (Fig. 5). As a result of immuno-staining, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was increased in PVN, 
particularly arcuate nuclei, of mice treated with Gardasil and Ptx compared with the area of vehicle mice. On the 
other hand, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 67 and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was decreased in 
PVN. The expression of glutamine synthetase, choline acetyltransferase was not changed. These results indicated 
that dopaminergic neurons were increased in the arcuate nuclei, while GABAergic neurons were reduced.
Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated that the combined administration of Gardasil and Ptx induced of poor tail 
movement and low locomotive mobility. In addition, vaccination did not have effect on the muscular strength.

Neuropathological observation reveals the following results; (1) structural damage to PVN, DMH, (2) the third 
ventricular atresia, (3) an increase in apoptosis around cavities of the thalamus and the hypothalamus; vascular 
endothelial cells in the hypothalamus were especially affected, and (4) increasing TH synthesis and decreasing 
GABA synthesis in the arcuate nuclei.
The low locomotive mobility of mice in group 4 (Fig. 1) was appeared to be derived from disruption of hypo-
thalamic motor networks, since pathological changes were discretely localized at the circumventricular structures 
(Fig. 2) and their muscle strength was normal. Several animal experiments have highlighted the importance of the 
hypothalamus for motor command, and indicate that hypothalamic command signals are primarily responsible for 
the driving of locomotion and that locomotor stepping is mediated by the perifornical and lateral hypothalamus22–24, 
while flight-directed locomotion and escaped jumps are mediated by medial hypothalamus25. The hypothalamus 
has also an important role in integration of neuronal circuitry for motor regulation, with connections to cingulate 
motor cortex in the limbic system, which project to the spinal cord and red nucleus, and have premotor func-
tions26. Since low mobility of the body on locomotive movements can be also seen frequently in patients suffering 
from HANS, we hypothesize that locomotive impairments in both murine motor phenotype and human HANS 
are linked to disrupted hypothalamic motor areas.
The cerebral ventricles are filled with CSF and constitute a communicating network connecting cavi-
ties27. Our data suggest that HPV vaccination may induce vascular endothelial cell apoptosis and may disrupt 
BBB-CSF barriers. Moreover, the narrowing of the ventricle could have been due to collapse of the barriers 
between the brain and ventricles, causing CSF to leak out of the brain28. CSF is important for maintaining brain

homeostasis, and narrowing of the ventricles is often seen in the patients suffering from intracranial hypo-
tension syndrome (ICH). Like the proposed mechanism for the ventricle narrowing observed in the current 
study, ICH is caused by CSF leakage and low CSF pressure29. Interestingly, some of these clinical symptoms 
are experienced by individuals suffering from HANS, such as orthostatic headache, dizziness, stiffness and so 
on30. Although there is currently no pathological information with regard to of HANS, it could be important to 
investigate effects of the vaccination on the CSF function and pathological features around the third ventricle 
in future.
Surprisingly, NK2 Homeobox 1 (Nkx2.1), also known as thyroid-specific transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) 
-deficient mice have been established and display similar morphological features including structural dam-
age to PVN and DMH and the third ventricular atresia to the vaccine-treated mice in this study. Nkx2.1 has 
been identified as a transcription factor for thyroid specific factors31,32, and has also been established as an 
important factor for early brain development33. Nkx2.1 is expressed in the ventral region of the forebrain34,35. 
In Nkx2.1-deficient mice, abnormalities are seen in the ventral and medial regions of the hypothalamus, the 
third ventricle is narrowed, and does not reach to the floor of the diencephalon36. Nkx2.1 is also known to be 
expressed in the hypothalamic region and periventricular areas from early phase of development to adult35. 
Further, Nkx2.1 is thought to play roles in puberty and reproductive function and schizophrenia35,37,38. In 
humans, Nkx2.1 gene mutations can cause benign hereditary chorea (BHC)39,40, a disease affecting the brain, 
lungs and thyroid. Patients with this mutation suffer from chorea, a variety of neurological characteristic, 
tremor, axial dystonia, and gait disturbance41. Taking the literature into account, our current data suggest that 
the HPV vaccine may disrupt signaling pathway mediated by Nkx2.1 that are expressed in the hypothalamic 
region. We studied on the neurotransmitters production in order to corroborate pathophysiological correlation 
of Nkx2.1, since some studies indicated the abnormalities of several neurotransmitters production in Nkx 2.1

deficient-mice in early development42, and also in adult mice35,38. We found similar phenotype of neurotrans-
mitters production in group 4 mice including increase of dopaminergic neurons and reduced GABAergic 
neurons (Fig. 5). These results may explain the symptom of endocrine system in HANS syndrome.
We have recently revealed the functions of hypothalamus are implicated in HANS by the clinical studies. The 
endocrine function tests showed the results suggesting hypothalamic dysfunction. HANS disorders are not of 
psychogenic origin but are derived from neuro-endocrinological disorders of the hypothalamus and its limbic 
networks15. Moreover, evidence has been accumulated which indicates the hypothalamus is concerned in cer-
tain elements of behavior/emotion22,24,25 and important for pain regulation43,44. PVN and DMH, impaired in 
our murine HANS model, integrally controls autonomic, endocrine, and plays an important role in homeostatic 
maintenance for those functions. Recent advance in neuroscience has highlighted the importance of the PVN for 
stress-related synaptic plasticity in the hypothalamus45. The DMH and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) have 
their roles in circadian control of sleep, and in the brain’s circadian pacemaker, respectively. Excitotoxic DMH 
lesions reduce circadian rhythms of wakefulness, feeding, and locomotor activity. Therefore, we hypothesize that 
the likely focus in HANS should be on the hypothalamus and the circumventricular organs around the third 
ventricle, characterized by leaky blood brain barrier, incidentally those clinical reports about functions of the 
hypothalamus are consistent with our data using mouse model.
In conclusion, our study revealed that exposure of the CNS to the HPV vaccine can induce neuronal degen-
eration and result in motor dysfunction in C57/BL6 mice, which were similar to the clinical symptoms associ-
ated with the HPV vaccination9,10. Moreover, co-injection of Ptx induced hypothalamic damages associated with 
motor dysfunctions at a higher frequency. Namely, it is likely to note the HPV vaccine alone result in weaker 
phenotype; rather, a mouse strain that is hyper-susceptive strain in its immune reaction (e.g., C57BL6) and the 
addition of Ptx damaging the BBB are required. There might be hypersensitive girls to HPV vaccine because of 
unclear predisposing factors and/or environmental concomitant events causing a damage to the BBB probably 
(similar to the damage that is induced by Ptx in the current study). A variable combination of these factors might 
result in individual suffering from HANS. Further analyses are required for verifying this possibility; however our 
data provide the first pathological model of HANS and will allow us in the future to explore a way to treat patients 
suffering from HANS.
Methods
Mice. 
Nine-week old female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Sankyo Laboratory (Japan) and used for 
the vaccination studies. Mice were kept under standard conditions in the animal facility at Tokyo Medical 
University and were provided with food and water ad libitum. All animal experiments were approved by the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Tokyo Medical University (the approval numbers: s-27050 and 
s-28039) and performed in accordance with institutional, science community, and national guidelines for animal 
experimentation.
Reagents and Antibodies. 
The antigen for experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and 
pertussis toxin (Ptx) were purchased from Hook Laboratories, and the HPV vaccine, Gardasil, was purchased 
from MSD K.K. The following antibodies were used in this study: anti- NG2, anti-GAD67 and anti-tyrosine 
hydroxylase antibodies from Merck Millipore (Germany); anti-GFAP, CD31, anti-choline acetyltransferase and 
anti-Glutamine synthetase from Abcam (Cambridge, UK); anti-GABA antibody from Sigma-Aldrich.
Vaccination. 
Groups of 11 week-old female C57BL/6 mice were intramuscularly administrated 100 μ 
l of 
Gardasil or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for a total of five times. Ptx was intraperitoneally administrated 2 
and 24 hours after immunization. The Gardasil vaccine or Ptx were administrated at 2- weeks or 4-week intervals, 
respectively. As a control, EAE was induced with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55 (MOG35-55) fol-
lowed the manufacturer’s instructions (Hooke Laboratories, USA). Disease severity was evaluated according to 
the following scores19; 0, no abnormality; 1, partially limp tail; 2, loss of tail tonicity; 3, partial hind limb paralysis; 
4, complete hind limb paralysis; 5, forelimb paralysis or moribund; 6, death. The most severe symptom of each 
mouse over the course of the study was evaluated.
Histology. 
Mice were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with PBS and 10% formaldehyde in PBS. 
Brains were then removed, fixed in 10% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Five-micrometer sec-
tions were obtained and deparaffinized. For general morphological analyses, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) 
and Klüver-Barrera (KB) staining were used. For immunohistochemistry, we performed antigen retrieval 
by heating sections in citrate buffer and quenched endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating sections 
in 3% hydrogen peroxide. The sections were blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS and 
incubated with primary antibodies. After incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated with horse-
radish peroxidase (HRP), bound antibodies were detected with 3, 3-diaminobenzidine. Stained sections 
were counterstained with hematoxylin, and all images were obtained using a Nanozoomer (Hamamatsu 
Photonics, Japan).
TUNEL Assay. 
Mouse brains were fixed in 10% formaldehyde in PBS and paraffin embedded. Sections 
were cut at 5 μ 
M and deparaffinized using a standard procedure. The TUNEL assay was performed using 
an in situ Apoptosis Detection kit (Takara bio Inc. Japan), stained sections were counterstained with 
hematoxylin.

The Publisher is retracting this Article because the experimental approach does not support the objectives of the 
study. The study was designed to elucidate the maximum implication of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine 
(Gardasil) in the central nervous system. However, the co-administration of pertussis toxin with high-levels of 
HPV vaccine is not an appropriate approach to determine neurological damage from HPV vaccine alone. The 
Authors do not agree with the retraction.
