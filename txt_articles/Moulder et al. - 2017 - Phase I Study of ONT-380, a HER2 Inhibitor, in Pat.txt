Abstract
Purpose: ONT-380 (ARRY-380) is a potent and selective oral
HER2 inhibitor. This Phase I study determined the MTD, phar-
macokinetics (PK) and antitumor activity of ONT-380 in HER2-
positive advanced solid tumors, with an expansion cohort of
patients with HER2þ MBC.
Experimental Design: ONT-380 was administered twice daily
(BID) in continuous 28-day cycles. After a modified 3þ3 dose-
escalation design determined the MTD, the expansion cohort was
enrolled. PK properties of ONT-380 and a metabolite were
determined. Response was evaluated by Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).
Results: Fifty patients received ONT-380 (escalation ¼ 33;
expansion ¼ 17); 43 patients had HER2þ MBC. Median prior
anticancer regimens ¼ 5. Dose-limiting toxicities of increased
transaminases occurred at 800 mg BID, thus 600 mg BID was the
MTD. Common AEs were usually Grade 1/2 in severity and
included nausea (56%), diarrhea (52%), fatigue (50%), vomiting
(40%) constipation, pain in extremity and cough (20% each). 5
patients (19%) treated at MTD had grade 3 AEs (increased
transaminases, rash, night sweats, anemia, and hypokalemia).
The half-life of ONT-380 was 5.38 hours and increases in exposure
were approximately dose proportional. In evaluable HER2þ MBC
(n ¼ 22) treated at doses � MTD, the response rate was 14% [all
partial response (PR)] and the clinical benefit rate (PR þ stable
disease � 24 weeks) was 27%.
Conclusions: ONT-380 had a lower incidence and severity of
diarrhea and rash than that typically associated with current dual
HER2/EGFR inhibitors and showed notable antitumor activity in
heavily pretreated HER2þ MBC patients, supporting its continued
development. Clin Cancer Res; 23(14); 3529–36. �2017 AACR.
Introduction
Approximately 15% to 20% of breast cancers have an ampli-
fication of the HER2/neu proto-oncogene and/or over-expres-
sion of its protein product, HER2 (1, 2), which has been
associated with poor prognosis before the development of
HER2-targeted therapies (3). Although multiple approved strat-
egies exist for disrupting HER2 signaling in HER2-positive
(HER2þ) metastatic breast cancer (MBC; refs. 4, 5), including
mAbs such as trastuzumab (6) and pertuzumab (7), the anti-
body–drug conjugate ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1;
ref. 8), and the small-molecule dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(TKI) lapatinib (9), several unmet needs exist in this patient
population. First, though existing targeted therapies are
improving outcomes in patients with HER2þ MBC, disease
resistance does eventually develop in most patients (10, 11).
Second, toxicity profiles for targeted agents, such as lapatinib,
often preclude combination regimens due to off-target effects,
such as skin rash and diarrhea, resulting from EGFR inhibition
(12–14). Finally, HER2þ primary tumors carry a predisposition
for central nervous system (CNS) metastasis (15, 16), necessi-
tating the development of targeted therapies that can cross the
blood–brain barrier.
ONT-380 (also known as ARRY-380) is a potent, selective, ATP-
competitive, orally administered small-molecule inhibitor of
HER2. ONT-380 has nanomolar activity against purified HER2
enzyme and was approximately 500-fold selective for HER2
versus EGFR in cell-based assays (17), properties that could
potentially translate clinically into a favorable toxicity profile in
comparison with less specific HER2 TKIs that also inhibit EGFR
(12–14). ONT-380 also significantly inhibited phosphorylation
of truncated HER2 (p110/p95), which is thought to be associated
with trastuzumab resistance in HER2þ breast cancer. Nonclinical
in vivo pharmacology studies of ONT-380 as a single agent, as well
as in combination with standard-of-care therapies, demonstrated
significant tumor growth inhibition in HER2-dependent tumor
xenograft models, including models of breast cancer (17, 18).

 ONT-380 treatment also significantly enhanced survival in HER2-
driven intracranial tumor xenograft models (19). Combined,
these preclinical data supported the rationale for the first-in-
human Phase I study of ONT-380 reported herein.
Patients and Methods
This study (NCT00650572) was conducted under all applica-
ble regulatory requirements. The study was approved by the
institutional review boards of all participating sites, and patients
provided written informed consent before the initiation of study-
related treatment or procedures.
Study design and treatment
This open-label Phase I study comprised both dose-escalation
and expansion components to determine the MTD of ONT-380
and assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and
preliminary antitumor activity of ONT-380. ONT-380 was dosed
orally as a powder-in-capsule formulation.
In the dose-escalation component, a modified 3 þ 3 dose-
escalation design was used to determine the MTD of ONT-380 in
patients with advanced HER2þ cancers. This modified design
allowed 3 to 4 evaluable patients to be enrolled per cohort, with
expansion up to a total of 6 evaluable patients if a dose-limiting
toxicity (DLT) was observed. Eligible patients received a single
dose of ONT-380 in a fasted state on Cycle 1 Day 1 and, if they did
not experience a DLT, twice-daily (BID) dosing in a fed state in
continuous 28-day cycles was initiated on Cycle 1 Day 3 and
continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or
patient withdrawal of informed consent. A starting dose of 25 mg
BID was used with additional cohorts at planned dose levels of
50, 100, 200, 300, 500, 650, and 800 mg BID. The MTD was
defined as the highest dose of ONT-380 at which no more than
1 of 6 evaluable patients experienced a DLT in Cycle 1. Patients
evaluable for DLT determination received at least 1 cycle of
ONT-380 without dose reduction in Cycle 1.
DLTs were any adverse event (AE) not clearly attributable to the
patient's disease, including hematologic toxicities of Grade 4
neutropenia � 7 days, Grade 3/4 neutropenia with fever, Grade
4 thrombocytopenia or anemia or any grade thrombocytopenia
associated with bleeding; non-hematologic toxicities of Grade 3
or 4 toxicity despite adequate supportive care, Grade 2 vomiting
on 2 consecutive days despite anti-emetic therapy and Grade 2
toxicity > 2 weeks; laboratory abnormalities with at least a 2-grade
increase that were associated with clinical signs and symptoms
that persisted for over 7 days; and interruption of dosing for >2
weeks if that interruption was secondary to drug-related toxicity.
Exceptions included Grade 3 nausea and vomiting in the absence
of anti-emetic prophylaxis.
In the expansion cohort, patients with HER2þ MBC received
ONT-380 at the declared MTD in continuous 28-day cycles
without regard to food and continued until disease progres-
sion, unacceptable toxicity or patient withdrawal of informed
consent.
Patient population
Patients were �18 years of age with HER2þ cancer (dose-
escalation cohorts) or HER2þ MBC with an accessible lesion for
biopsy (expansion cohort). Initially, patients with advanced solid
tumors historically known to express HER2 were enrolled (N ¼
19), but the study was later amended to allow only patients with
documented HER2þ disease as determined by immunohis-
tochemistry [IHC] 3þ, fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]þ,
silver in situ hybridization [SISH]þ (expansion only) and/or
chromogenic in situ hybridization [CISH]þ (expansion only;
refs. 20, 21). Other key inclusion criteria included disease pro-
gression on at least one prior therapeutic regimen (for metastatic
disease in the expansion cohort) or no curative therapy available,
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG
PS) 0 to 2, adequate organ function and left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF) �40% by cardiac imaging. Patients with HER2þ
MBC had to receive prior therapy with trastuzumab and lapatinib
(if available) or declined those treatments before entry into the
study. Patients with uncontrolled or symptomatic brain metas-
tases or a history of Gilbert's syndrome or other genetic disorders
affecting conjugation of bilirubin were excluded.
Safety assessments
Safety was continually monitored with assessments occurring
in Cycle 1 on Days 1, 2, 3, 8, 15 and 22 (dose-escalation cohorts)
and on Days 1, 8, and 15 (expansion cohort). In subsequent
cycles, patients in all cohorts were assessed every 28 days. Assess-
ments included the monitoring of AEs, DLTs (in Cycle 1 for dose-
escalation cohorts only), clinical laboratory parameters (hema-
tology, chemistry, urinalysis), electrocardiogram (ECG) results,
ECOG PS, vital signs, physical examination findings and cardiac
imaging to assess LVEF.
The severity of an AE was assessed and reported by the Inves-
tigator using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 3.0. A com-
posite term of "combined rash" included the preferred terms (PT)
of dermatitis acneiform, acne, skin exfoliation and all PTs that
included the term "rash."
Response assessments
Tumor response was assessed every 8 weeks using standard
clinical evaluations, including Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1.0 with modification (dose-
escalation cohorts; including a maximum of 3 target lesions and
not including clinical lesions as measurable) or RECIST, Version
1.1 (expansion cohort), when applicable. Serological tumor
Translational Relevance
ONT-380 (ARRY-380) selectively inhibits the receptor tyro-
sine kinase HER2 relative to EGFR. In HER2-overexpressing
cell lines, ONT-380 blocked proliferation and the phosphor-
ylation of HER2 and its downstream effector, Akt. By contrast,
in the EGFR-overexpressing cell lines, it weakly inhibited
phosphorylation
and
proliferation,
demonstrating
that
ONT-380 may have potential to block HER2 signaling without
causing the toxicities of EGFR inhibition. Further, one of the
key challenges in HER2 metastatic breast cancer remains the
identification of molecules that cross the blood–brain barrier.
In preclinical studies with intracranial tumor models, treat-
ment of mice with ONT-380 compared with lapatinib or
neratinib showed a survival benefit when each drug was dosed
at the MTD. Together, these data support the hypothesis that
ONT-380 may be an effective and well tolerated treatment for
HER2þ MBC with or without CNS metastasis.

 marker levels were incorporated into the overall response assess-
ment per RECIST. Patients who had measurable disease and at
least 1 follow-up scan were considered evaluable for response.
Pharmacokinetic assessments
The PK of ONT-380 and a metabolite were characterized in
both the dose-escalation and expansion cohorts. For the dose-
escalation cohorts, blood samples were collected on Cycle 1 Day 1
after patients fasted for 2 hours before and 1 hour after a single
dose of ONT-380 (fasted assessment; predose and 0.5 to 24 hours
postdose), on Cycle 1 Day 3 with food (fed assessment; predose
and 1 to 4 hours postdose) and on Cycle 1 Day 15 (predose and
0.5 to 12 hours postdose), with additional trough samples col-
lected predose on Cycle 1 Day 8 and on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3 and 4.
For the expansion cohort, blood samples were collected on Cycle
1 Day 1 (predose), Cycle 1 Day 15 and Cycle 2 Day 1 (for both
days: predose and 0.5 to 12 hours postdose), with additional
trough samples collected on Day 1 of Cycles 2 through 6. Plasma
concentrations were determined using a validated Good Labora-
tory Practice (GLP) liquid chromatography with tandem mass
spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS) method. The individual
plasma concentration–time data for each analyte were evaluated
with noncompartmental analysis using Phoenix WinNonlin,
Version 6.3 (Pharsight Corporation).
Results
Patient characteristics
Between April 2008 and July 2011, a total of 50 patients
(median age 58 years; 90% female) were enrolled at 4 sites in
the United States and Canada. Thirty-three patients were enrolled
in the dose-escalation phase, with an additional 17 patients
treated in the expansion phase. Most patients had breast cancer,
were heavily pretreated and had a favorable ECOG PS. All patients
with breast cancer had received prior trastuzumab and 81% of
these patients had received prior lapatinib. Patient characteristics
are summarized in Table 1.
Dose-escalation, DLTs, and MTD
Dose escalation proceeded through the planned cohorts of 25
to 650 mg BID, with no DLTs observed. In the 800 mg BID cohort,
2 of 4 patients experienced DLTs (both of Grade 3 increased
alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and/or aspartate aminotransfer-
ase [AST]), thus the 800 mg BID dose was declared not tolerable.
Of note, all DLTs resolved within 2 weeks with interruption of
dosing and upon re-challenge at a lower dose, patients tolerated
continued ONT-380 treatment. Subsequently, the 650 mg BID
cohort should have been expanded to include 3 additional
patients to define the MTD; however, the inventory of 25 mg
capsules was limited. Therefore, 7 patients were enrolled into a
600 mg BID dose-escalation cohort. With none of these 7 patients
experiencing DLTs, the 600 mg BID dose was declared the MTD.
For the following safety discussion, the 600 and 650 mg dose
levels were combined to represent the MTD dose level.
Safety and tolerability
Adverse events are summarized in Table 2. The most com-
monly reported AEs (all grades) were nausea, diarrhea, fatigue,
vomiting, rash (combined term), constipation, cough and pain
in extremity. Grade 3 AEs were reported in 42% of patients;
those occurring in >1 patient were anemia and cellulitis
(3 patients each, 6%) and abdominal pain, hypokalemia,
increased ALT, increased AST, musculoskeletal chest pain and
vomiting (3 patients each, 4%). Four patients (8%) experienced
one Grade 4 event each, none deemed treatment related; these
were events of asthenia, diabetes insipidus, hypercalcemia and
sepsis. At the MTD, the most common AEs were diarrhea,
nausea, fatigue, vomiting, pain in extremity and urinary tract
infection (Table 2); the majority of these events were Grade 1 or
Grade 2 in severity.
The most commonly reported AEs considered treatment-
related were nausea (17 patients, 34%), diarrhea (11 patients,
22%), fatigue (10 patients, 20%), and vomiting, increased ALT
and increased AST (6 patients each 12%). The severity of
treatment-related AEs increased with higher ONT-380 dose, with

AEs
(including
hypokalemia,

in the �600 mg BID cohorts. At the MTD, the most common AEs
considered treatment related by the Investigator were nausea
and diarrhea and all of these events were less than Grade 3 in
severity (Table 3).
Two patients (4%) died of disease progression within 30 days
of their last dose of ONT-380, 12 patients (24%) developed SAEs

 and 5 patients (10%) discontinued ONT-380 due to an AE; none
of these events were considered related to ONT-380 by the
Investigator.
Fifteen patients (30%) required interruption of ONT-380 due
to AEs and 4 patients (8%) underwent a dose reduction. Dose
modifications were primarily due to elevations in liver function
tests (LFT) and ONT-380 was almost always re-initiated with
tolerability at the initial or lower doses; no elevations in LFTs led
to study drug discontinuation.
Typically, elevations in LFTs were observed within a week of
ONT-380 initiation and the incidence and severity of these
elevations increased with increased dose. Although common
(62% of patients treated), elevations in LFTs were mostly Grade
1 and were reversible upon interruption or dose reduction of
ONT-380. No Hy's Law cases were observed.
Grade 1/2 shifts in electrolytes (up to 34% of patients) and
serum creatinine (48% of patients) were also common and
occurred most often at doses � 300 mg BID. Grade 3/4 electrolyte
imbalances were rare and occurred only at doses �500 mg BID.
Shifts in these parameters were reversible upon interruption of
ONT-380.
Pharmacokinetics
Following a single dose of ONT-380 (Cycle 1 Day 1), the
geometric mean plasma concentration-time profiles for ONT-
380 were similar in shape across the dose range studied (25 to
800 mg) and geometric mean concentrations tended to increase
with increasing dose.
Repeat-dose geometric mean plasma ONT-380 concentra-
tion-time profiles (Cycle 1 Day 15) were similar in shape to the
Cycle 1 Day 1 profiles and across cohorts, and tended to
increase with increasing dose (Fig. 1). Predose (trough) plasma
ONT-380 concentrations on Cycle 1 Day 15 were similar to the
12-hour post-dose mean concentrations of the same day, which

 is indicative of steady-state exposure. At the MTD, trough
concentrations were maintained above the predicted IC90 value
(22). The results of the dose proportionality assessment suggest
that ONT-380 exposure was approximately dose proportional.
Although accumulation was variable, an overall geometric
mean RAUC of 1.95 (104% CV) indicated moderate accumula-
tion with repeat dosing. On both Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day
15, the overall median Tmax for ONT-380 was approximately
2 hours and the overall median half-life was 5.38 hours.
Exposure of the metabolite was approximately 12% that of
ONT-380, regardless of day. No significant food effect was
observed for ONT-380 or metabolite exposure; however, var-
iability was high.
Response
Among the 35 patients evaluable for response at any dose
level, the best tumor response per RECIST was confirmed partial
response (PR) in 3 patients (9%) and stable disease (SD) in 20
patients (57%; including 2 patients with unconfirmed PRs).
Among the 22 HER2þ MBC patients with measurable disease at
baseline that were treated at doses of �600 mg BID, the clinical
benefit rate (PR þ SD � 24 weeks) was 27% (6 patients),
including 3 confirmed PRs and 3 SDs (Table 4). Tumor shrink-
age was observed in both skin and visceral lesions, including
liver metastases. One additional patient without measurable
disease at baseline had SD for �24 weeks. In patients who had
not received prior lapatinib (n ¼ 7), 1 (14%) had PR, 3 (43%)
had SD and 3 (43%) had PD as best response. In the 3 patients
with a confirmed PR, the duration of response was 12.3 weeks
(N ¼ 1) and 28 weeks (N ¼ 2). All 3 of these patients had
received prior trastuzumab, and 2 had also received prior
lapatinib. Figure 2 illustrates the change in the sum of longest
diameter of target lesions per RECIST in patients with HER2þ
MBC treated at doses �600 mg BID with measurable disease
and evaluable follow-up scans.
Discussion
This Phase I study determined the MTD of the oral HER2-
selective inhibitor ONT-380 as 600 mg BID using a powder-in-
capsule formulation. Overall, ONT-380 was well tolerated with
no treatment-related grade 4 events, SAEs or AEs leading to
discontinuation. Grade 3 elevations in hepatic transaminases
were dose limiting at 800 mg BID; however, these elevations were
reversible within 2 weeks by holding study drug and did not recur
upon re-challenge at the MTD.
ONT-380 was found to have favorable PK properties,
although variable exposure was observed. No significant food
effect was observed for ONT-380 or metabolite exposure. When
dosed at the MTD, mean steady-state ONT-380 concentrations
were maintained at or above the predicted IC90 for HER2
inhibition. Of note, a tablet formulation demonstrating in-
creased exposure and lower variability (22) is being used in all
current clinical studies (23, 24).

 In addition, ONT-380 demonstrated notable single-agent anti-
tumor activity in patients with HER2þ MBC treated at doses �
MTD. In this heavily pretreated population (all had received prior
trastuzumab and 84% had received prior lapatinib), there was a
clinical benefit rate (PR þ SD > 24 weeks) of 27%, including
durable confirmed PRs (14%) in patients who received after at
least 2 prior HER2-targeted therapies. While response compar-
isons across clinical studies are difficult due to confounding
factors such as prior treatment and other clinical factors, the
response to single-agent ONT-380 is within range of that seen
with both lapatinib (25) and neratinib monotherapy (26),
though arguably for ONT-380 in a population that had under-
gone therapy with a higher number of HER2-targeted therapies.
Perhaps a more relevant comparison based upon the number of
prior therapies is the TH3RESA trial in which heavily pretreated
patients with advanced HER2þ breast cancer were randomized to
receive either ado-trastuzumab emtansine or physician's choice
(27). In TH3RESA, all patients had received prior therapy with
both trastuzumab and lapatinib and the use of ado-trastuzumab
emtansine was associated with an objective response rate of 31%
in patients with measurable disease (N ¼ 345) versus 9% in the
physician's choice group (N ¼ 163). Though ONT-380 did not
have as high a response rate as ado-trastuzumab emtansine,
response was higher than that of the physician's choice group,
suggesting a potential role for ONT-380 over chemotherapy/
trastuzumab-containing regimens as ado-trastuzumab emtansine
continues to become an earlier treatment line for HER2þ breast
cancer. To this point, a trial of ONT-380 in combination with
trastuzumab and/or capecitabine is being conducted in patients
with disease progression on ado-trastuzumab emtansine (24).
As important, during treatment with ONT-380, there was a low
incidence of Grade 3 toxicities commonly associated with dual
EGFR/HER2 inhibitors, with only one patient each experiencing
Grade 3 diarrhea and Grade 3 rash. This compares favorably to the
approximately 10% to 30% incidence of Grade 3/4 diarrhea
associated with the single-agent recommended Phase II dose
of lapatinib or neratinib used to treat metastatic breast cancer
(25–28). This noted absence of treatment-related high-grade
diarrhea makes ONT-380 a suitable agent for combination ther-
apy with capecitabine or trastuzumab, theoretically, without the
relatively high rate of diarrhea (or rash) that has been associated
with these agents when given in combination with nonspecific
HER2 inhibitors (25, 29–31).
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that ONT-380 appears
to have a more favorable and manageable toxicity profile com-
pared with either current dual EGFR/HER2 or pan-HER TKIs, with
clinical activity in a heavily pretreated HER2þ MBC cohort. There
is increasing evidence that dual targeting of HER2 (but not EGFR)
can lead to further improvements in efficacy. In particular, the
combination of a small-molecule inhibitor with an antibody-
based therapy may be effective in overcoming resistance; accord-
ingly, ONT-380 is currently undergoing evaluation in patients
with HER2þ MBC in combination Phase Ib studies with capeci-
tabine and/or trastuzumab (NCT02025192; ref. 24) and ado-
trastuzumab emtansine (NCT01983501; ref. 23). Both studies
have completed enrollment with patients continuing to receive
treatment. Preliminary data show that the combination of ONT-
380 with other active treatments was well-tolerated and demon-
strates encouraging antitumor activity in a high-risk patient pop-
ulation (24, 32). In addition, these studies have enrolled expan-
sion cohorts of patients with CNS metastases based upon pre-
clinical animal models demonstrating adequate CNS penetration
for ONT-380 showing preliminary safety and efficacy in this at
need patient population with heavily pre-treated HER2þ MBC
with CNS metastases (33). Currently, an international Phase II
randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of ONT-
380 in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine in
patients with pretreated, unresectable locally advanced or meta-
static HER2þ MBC (NCT02614794) is actively recruiting patients.
