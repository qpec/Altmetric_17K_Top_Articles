BACKGROUND
Sentinel-lymph-node biopsy is associated with increased melanoma-specific survival (i.e., 
survival until death from melanoma) among patients with node-positive intermediate-
thickness melanomas (1.2 to 3.5 mm). The value of completion lymph-node dissection for 
patients with sentinel-node metastases is not clear.
METHODS
In an international trial, we randomly assigned patients with sentinel-node metastases detected 
by means of standard pathological assessment or a multimarker molecular assay to immediate 
completion lymph-node dissection (dissection group) or nodal observation with ultrasonogra-
phy (observation group). The primary end point was melanoma-specific survival. Secondary end 
points included disease-free survival and the cumulative rate of nonsentinel-node metastasis.
RESULTS
Immediate completion lymph-node dissection was not associated with increased melanoma-
specific survival among 1934 patients with data that could be evaluated in an intention-to-
treat analysis or among 1755 patients in the per-protocol analysis. In the per-protocol analy-
sis, the mean (±SE) 3-year rate of melanoma-specific survival was similar in the dissection 
group and the observation group (86±1.3% and 86±1.2%, respectively; P 
= 
0.42 by the log-
rank test) at a median follow-up of 43 months. The rate of disease-free survival was slightly 
higher in the dissection group than in the observation group (68±1.7% and 63±1.7%, respec-
tively; P 
= 
0.05 by the log-rank test) at 3 years, based on an increased rate of disease control 
in the regional nodes at 3 years (92±1.0% vs. 77±1.5%; P<0.001 by the log-rank test); these 
results must be interpreted with caution. Nonsentinel-node metastases, identified in 11.5% 
of the patients in the dissection group, were a strong, independent prognostic factor for 
recurrence (hazard ratio, 1.78; P 
= 
0.005). Lymphedema was observed in 24.1% of the pa-
tients in the dissection group and in 6.3% of those in the observation group.
CONCLUSIONS
Immediate completion lymph-node dissection increased the rate of regional disease control 
and provided prognostic information but did not increase melanoma-specific survival 
among patients with melanoma and sentinel-node metastases. (Funded by the National

S
entinel-lymph-node biopsy is a stan-
dard procedure in the care of appropriately 
selected patients with melanoma. The first 
Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial 
(MSLT-I) confirmed the value of early nodal 
evaluation and treatment.1-3 This prospective, 
international, randomized trial showed that the 
pathologic status of the sentinel node or nodes 
was the most important prognostic factor and 
that patients who underwent sentinel-node biopsy 
had fewer recurrences of melanoma than pa-
tients who underwent wide excision and nodal 
observation. Among patients with intermediate-
thickness melanomas (defined as 1.2 to 3.5 mm) 
and nodal metastases, early surgical treatment, 
guided by sentinel-node biopsy, was associated 
with increased melanoma-specific survival (sur-
vival until death from melanoma). These results 
provide support for the recommendation by sev-
eral professional organizations that staging by 
means of sentinel-node biopsy should be per-
formed when appropriate.4-7
Currently, immediate completion lymph-node 
dissection (removal of the remaining regional 
lymph nodes after sentinel-node excision) is usu-
ally recommended for patients with sentinel-node 
metastases. However, prospective evidence of the 
efficacy of completion lymph-node dissection is 
lacking, and the procedure carries a risk of ad-
verse events.8 Results of retrospective evaluations 
of the usefulness of completion lymph-node dis-
section are inconclusive.9-11 Available data from 
one prospective study do not suggest a benefit 
from immediate dissection, but this study is not 
sufficiently powered to rule out a clinically sig-
nificant benefit.12 In addition, in most patients, 
nodal disease is limited to the sentinel lymph 
node or nodes and is removed by means of bi-
opsy. Conversely, patients with even microscopic 
involvement of nonsentinel nodes have an over-
all poorer prognosis and outcomes that are 
similar to those in patients with clinically appar-
ent nodal disease.13,14
In the second Multicenter Selective Lymphad-
enectomy Trial (MSLT-II), we evaluated the use-
fulness of completion lymph-node dissection in 
patients with melanoma and sentinel lymph-
node metastases as compared with observation 
with frequent nodal ultrasonography and dissec-
tion only in patients in whom clinically detected 
nodal recurrence had developed.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
MSLT-II, an international, multicenter, random-
ized, phase 3 trial to evaluate the usefulness of 
completion lymph-node dissection in patients 
with melanoma and sentinel-node metastases, 
consisted of a screening phase in which patients 
were enrolled before sentinel-node biopsy and a 
randomization phase in which completion lymph-
node dissection was compared with observation 
and nodal ultrasonography (Fig. 1). The trial was 
conducted at 63 centers.
MSLT-II was designed by the MSLT-II execu-
tive committee with input from the pathology 
and ultrasonography oversight committees (see 
the Supplementary Appendix, available with the 
full text of this article at NEJM.org). Data were 
collected prospectively on paper and later on 
Web-based case-report forms. The authors vouch 
for the accuracy and completeness of the data 
and analyses reported and for the fidelity of the 
trial to the protocol, available at NEJM.org.
Nodal metastasis was determined by means 
of standard pathological assessment (including 
immunohistochemical tests performed according 
to institutional protocols) or by means of a pre-
viously described quantitative reverse-transcrip-
tase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay 
during the screening phase.15 Patients had to 
have undergone randomization and completion 
lymph-node dissection within 140 days after di-
agnostic biopsy.
The randomization phase involved enrollment 
of patients who had undergone screening and 
had pathologically or molecularly positive sentinel-
node metastases and patients who had not under-
gone screening in whom sentinel-node metasta-
ses were detected by means of pathological 
assessment. In the randomization phase, fewer 
patients with RT-PCR–positive findings than 
anticipated were enrolled. In 2012, the data and 
safety monitoring board determined that such 
patients should no longer undergo randomization, 
since attainment of sufficient power to evaluate

a therapeutic effect in that group was not feasi-
ble. The data and safety monitoring board recom-
mended continued follow-up of these patients to 
assess outcomes.
At the third interim analysis, the data and 
safety monitoring board determined that detec-
tion of a significant survival difference between 
the trial groups was unlikely and recommended 
that the current primary end-point data be re-
leased. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analy-
ses of the outcome variables showed similar 
results. Results of per-protocol analyses are 
reported in this article, since they are likely to 
be the most clinically pertinent. The intention-to-
treat data for the primary end point (melanoma-
specific survival) are provided in Figure S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
Patients
Eligible patients who provided written informed 
consent were randomly assigned to undergo com-
pletion lymph-node dissection or nodal observa-
tion. These patients were 18 to 75 years of age 
and had clinically localized cutaneous melanoma, 
an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group perfor-
mance status of 0 or 1 (on a 5-point scale, with 
0 indicating an absence of disability and higher 
numbers indicating greater disability), a non–
melanoma-related life expectancy of 10 years or 
more, and a tumor-positive sentinel node. The 
trial was opened before the universal application 
of registration. The trial opened in December 
2004 and was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov on 
February 27, 2006. At the time of registration, 
119 patients had been enrolled in the trial.
Randomization was performed in a 1:1 ratio 
with the use of a permuted-block design, which 
was stratified according to Breslow thickness, 
ulceration, method of metastasis detection (stan-
dard pathological assessment or RT-PCR assay), 
and enrollment at an MSLT-I center. Patients who 
were assigned to the observation group were 
monitored by means of clinical examination every 
4 months during the first 2 years, every 6 months 
during years 3 through 5, and then annually. 
Nodal ultrasonographic assessment of the senti-
nel-node basin occurred at each visit for the first 
5 years; findings were considered to be abnor-
mal on the basis of a length:depth ratio of less 
than 2, a hypoechoic center, an absence of hilar 
vessels, or focal nodularity with increased vascu-
larity. Follow-up of the dissection group involved 
the same schedule, but without protocol-man-
dated nodal ultrasonography.
Statistical Analysis
For the primary end point, melanoma-specific 
survival, we used the log-rank test to compare 
the rates among patients in the dissection group 
and the observation group in the intention-to-
treat population. Secondary end points included 
overall survival, disease-free survival, survival 
without recurrence of regional nodal metastases, 
distant metastasis–free survival, and the extent 
of nodal involvement. Time zero was the time of 
randomization. Melanoma-specific survival was 
determined at the time of melanoma-related 
death. Disease-free survival was the time to any 
recurrence. Survival without nodal recurrence 
was the time to recurrence within the draining 
nodal basin. For survival, comparisons between 
the two groups were performed by means of the 
log-rank test for univariable testing and Cox re-
gression for adjusted comparisons. Nodal recur-
rence occurred in a draining regional basin, local 
and in-transit recurrence occurred between the 
primary site and the regional basin, and distant 
recurrence occurred beyond the regional basin.
We estimated that with a total sample of 1925 
patients, the trial would have a power of 83% to 
detect a between-group difference of 5 percent-
age points in melanoma-specific survival. All tests 
were two-tailed. Power was reassessed by the 
data and safety monitoring board before closure 
of enrollment to ensure that an adequate sample 
size had been obtained. The cumulative rate of 
nonsentinel-node metastases was determined by 
clinical follow-up in the observation group and 
according to total in-basin nodal recurrence or 
nonsentinel-node metastasis on immediate com-
pletion lymph-node dissection in the dissection 
group.
Data were summarized with means and stan-
dard deviations, medians and ranges, or both in 
the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. 
Chi-square and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were 
used to compare results for patients in the dis-
section group who actually underwent comple-
tion lymph-node dissection (these patients were 
included in the per-protocol and intention-to-
treat analyses) with results for those who did not 
undergo the assigned completion lymph-node dis-

section (these patients were included only in the 
intention-to-treat analysis). Survival curves were 
computed with the use of the Kaplan–Meier 
method and stratified according to group alone 
or according to group and method of metastasis 
detection (pathological assessment vs. RT-PCR). 
Cox proportional-hazards regression models were 
constructed separately for the two groups; these 
models included demographic factors, trial strati-
fication factors, and nonsentinel-node metasta-
sis at the time of completion lymph-node dissec-
tion. Subgroup analyses included subgroups that 
were defined according to the patients’ sex and 
age, the Breslow thickness, the location and 
number of positive nodes, and the presence or 
absence of ulceration. Cox proportional-hazards 
regression was used to estimate the subgroup-
specific hazard ratios.
Results
Patients
From December 2004 through March 2014, a 
total of 3531 patients were enrolled in the 
screening phase and 1939 patients underwent 
randomization (Fig. 1). Demographic and patho-
logic features of the dissection and observation 
groups were similar (Table 1, and Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). A greater proportion 
of patients assigned to completion lymph-node 
dissection than to observation declined their as-
signed treatment. However, the per-protocol co-
horts were similar with respect to prognostic 
factors (Table 1).
In the dissection group, 143 patients were ex-
cluded from the per-protocol analysis. Of those 
patients, 140 declined the assigned treatment. 
Patients who were excluded from the per-proto-
col analysis were more likely than patients who 
were not excluded to have never smoked, to have 
nonulcerated primary tumors, and to have an 
RT-PCR–positive sentinel node (Table S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The sentinel-node tu-
mor burden in both groups was low; the median 
diameter of the largest tumor deposit was 0.61 
mm in the dissection group and 0.67 mm in the 
observation group.
Survival Rates
At 3 years of follow-up, there was no significant 
difference in the mean (±SE) rate of melanoma-
specific survival between the dissection group 
and the observation group in the per-protocol 
analysis (86±1.3% and 86±1.2%, respectively; 
P 
= 
0.42 by the log-rank test) (Fig. 2A) or the inten-
tion-to-treat analyses (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). In addition, there was no significant 
between-group difference in melanoma-specific 
survival after adjustment for other prognostic 
factors (hazard ratio for death, 1.08; 95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 0.88 to 1.34; P 
= 
0.42).
An analysis with available follow-up data sug-
gested that an RT-PCR–positive sentinel node did 
not have an effect on survival that was as nega-
tive as the effect anticipated in the statistical 
design of the trial, so the results from the two 
groups are also reported separately here and in 
the remaining analyses (Fig. 2B). The results of 
an analysis of both groups together are shown in 
Figure S2 in the Supplementary Appendix. A sub-
group analysis, including an analysis based on 
sentinel-node tumor burden, did not reveal any 
subgroups that derived a significant melanoma-
specific survival benefit from completion lymph-
node dissection (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
At 3 years of follow-up, the rate of disease-
free survival was slightly higher in the dissection 
group than in the observation group (68±1.7% 
and 63±1.7%, respectively; P 
= 
0.05 by the log-rank 
test) (Fig. 3A, and Fig. S2A in the Supplementary 
Appendix), although the results of secondary 
outcome analyses must be viewed cautiously given 
the lack of significance for the primary end 
point. This difference in disease-free survival 
appears to result from a reduction in the rate of 
nodal recurrence after completion lymph-node 
dissection (Fig. 3B, and Fig. S2B in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). This corresponds to an in-
crease in the rate of disease control in the regional 
nodes at 3 years (92±1.0% in the dissection 
group vs. 77±1.5% in the observation group, 
P<0.001 by the log-rank test). After adjustment, 
the rate of nodal recurrence among patients 
with sentinel-node metastases detected by means 
of pathological assessment was 69% lower in the 
dissection group than in the observation group 
(hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.41; P<0.001). 
No significant between-group difference in dis-
tant metastasis–free survival was detected (ad-
justed hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.31; 
P 
= 
0.31) (Fig. 3C, and Fig. S2C in the Supplemen-

tary Appendix). Types of initial recurrence are 
listed in Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Prognostic Factors
Potential prognostic factors affecting melanoma-
specific survival were examined. Since the patho-
logic status of nonsentinel nodes was unknown 
in the observation group, the two groups of the 
trial were considered separately. In the entire 
trial (including patients with positive RT-PCR 
results), Breslow thickness and the number of 
sentinel nodes that were positive on pathological 
assessment (0 vs. >0) were significant prognos-
tic factors in both groups, and male sex was a 
significant prognostic factor in the observation 
group (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). However, since the RT-PCR group appeared 
to be prognostically distinct, an analysis was 
also performed that included only patients with 
sentinel nodes that were positive on pathological 
assessment (Table 2). In the observation group, 
male sex was no longer a significant prognostic 
factor, and it remained nonsignificant in the dis-
section group. Breslow thickness was a signifi-
cant prognostic factor in both groups, and the 
pathologic status of nonsentinel nodes was a 
significant prognostic factor in the dissection 
group (hazard ratio for death, 1.78; P 
= 
0.005). 
The number of involved sentinel nodes was not 
a significant prognostic factor.
Among patients who underwent immediate 
completion lymph-node dissection, nonsentinel-
node metastases were detected on pathological 
assessment in 11.5%, and over time, with nodal 
recurrences in that group, the percentage of 
patients in whom nonsentinel-node metastases 
were detected increased to an actuarial rate of 
17.9% at 3 years and 19.9% at 5 years (Fig. 3D). 
In the observation group, the percentage of 
patients in whom ultrasonographic or physical 
examination revealed involved nonsentinel nodes 
increased to 22.9% at 3 years and 26.1% at 5 years, 
exceeding the rate in the dissection group at both 
time points (P 
= 
0.02 and P 
= 
0.005, respectively).
Adverse Events
Adverse events were more common among pa-
tients after completion lymph-node dissection 
than among patients in the observation group. 
At the most recent follow-up on April 30, 2016, 
a total of 24.1% of the patients in the dissection 
group and 6.3% of those in the observation group 
had had lymphedema (P<0.001). Among the pa-
tients who had lymphedema, this condition was 
mild in 64%, moderate in 33%, and severe in 3%.
Discussion
The management of regional lymph nodes has 
long been controversial in the treatment of many

Panel A shows disease‑free survival, Panel B shows survival without nodal recurrence, and Panel C shows distant metastasis–free survival 
according to trial group (completion lymph‑node dissection or observation). Subgroup 1 comprised patients in the dissection group 
with pathologically detected metastases; subgroup 2, patients in the observation group with pathologically detected metastases; sub‑

Completion Dissection or Observation in Melanoma
and professional organizations for the treatment 
of melanoma.4-7
However, in patients with sentinel-node metas-
tases, the value of completion lymph-node dis-
section remains controversial. Since most such 
patients have all nodal metastases removed by 
means of the sentinel-node biopsy procedure, 
they cannot derive additional therapeutic value 
from completion lymph-node dissection. Even 
microscopic nonsentinel-node metastases por-
tend a markedly worse prognosis, similar to that 
of patients with bulky, clinically diagnosed metas-
tases,13,14 than the prognosis in patients with 
metastases that are limited to the sentinel lymph 
nodes. Patients with nonsentinel-node metasta-
sis may be unlikely to benefit from early dissec-
tion. Finally, completion lymph-node dissection 
is associated with higher morbidity than sentinel-
node biopsy alone, so an appraisal of the value 
of the procedure is important.
Previous data regarding this clinical question 
have been inconclusive. Retrospective series have 
produced varied results and are subject to a con-
siderable risk of selection bias.9-11 The findings 
of one prospective study were similar to those in 
our trial, but its size (483 patients underwent 
randomization) and most recent follow-up left 
enough statistical uncertainty to preclude defini-
tive conclusions.12 MSLT-II, in which 1939 pa-
tients underwent randomization with a median 
follow-up of 43 months, provided sufficient data 
to resolve the central question: no significant 
survival benefit was imparted by immediate com-
pletion lymph-node dissection among patients 
with sentinel-node metastases. However, com-
pletion lymph-node dissection did provide other 
potential value for patients with melanoma, 
including improved staging and an increased 
rate of regional disease control.
Most patients in the trial population had a 
low-volume nodal tumor burden. Indeed, some 
patients had only molecular indications of mela-
noma in the sentinel node, determined by means 
of RT-PCR. Those patients had outcomes that 
were not as poor as those in retrospective studies 
using the same assay.15,17 However, any variance

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
from pretrial event-rate estimates is unlikely to 
have affected the overall result, since the RT-PCR–
positive group constituted only 12% of the ran-
domized study population. Furthermore, the num-
ber of patients with pathologically detected 
metastases actually exceeded the number in the 
statistical plan. Patients with a larger sentinel-
node tumor burden are more likely than patients 
with a smaller burden to have nonsentinel-node 
metastases, and the small number of patients 
with a larger sentinel-node tumor burden in this 
trial limits statistical confidence for those pa-
tients specifically. It may be possible to use an 
estimation of the risk of nonsentinel-node metas-
tases based on sentinel-node tumor burden and 
primary tumor characteristics to help identify 
patients who may benefit from completion lymph-
node dissection.18-20 However, a subgroup evalu-
ation of patients with a greater disease burden 
(maximal tumor diameter >1 mm) did not indi-
cate that a benefit from completion lymph-node 
dissection was more likely in high-risk groups 
than in low-risk groups.
The current trial confirms that the patho-
logic status of nonsentinel nodes has indepen-
dent prognostic value, whereas the number of 
involved sentinel nodes was not significantly 
related to melanoma-specific survival. Although 
this finding is somewhat counterintuitive, it 
echoes retrospective data from multiple institu-
tions.13,14 This confirmation in a prospective 
trial of the large effect of nonsentinel node 
status on prognosis reaffirms its staging value. 
A lack of this information may impede the most 
appropriate risk stratification and selection of 
adjuvant therapy for patients who do not under-
go completion lymph-node dissection.
Immediate completion lymph-node dissection 
reduced the rate of regional nodal recurrence by 
nearly 70%, leading to a small but significant 
decrease in the overall risk of recurrence. Since 
no significant difference between the groups 
was noted in the primary end point, differences 
with respect to the secondary end points must 
be interpreted with caution. A nonsignificant 
difference in distant metastasis–free survival 
was noted at late time points, but as of this writ-
ing, events at those time points have been few, 
and additional follow-up is necessary. Our trial 
was unable to determine the safety of avoiding 
completion lymph-node dissection in patients 
who are unable to undergo frequent follow-up 
evaluations or in patients who receive treatment 
at institutions that are not able to perform 
nodal ultrasonography.
The advantages of immediate completion 
lymph-node dissection are tempered by the com-
plications of the procedure. As of this writing, 
lymphedema has been observed in 24% of the 
patients in the dissection group and 6% of the 
patients in the observation group. As expected, 
there were significantly more complications 
among patients who underwent completion 
lymph-node dissection than among those who 
did not, although the adverse events associated 
with the surgical procedure were often transient. 
Although a complete assessment and compari-
son of lymphedema with other complications 
would require additional follow-up, we think 
that the decreased overall number of dissections 
among patients in the observation group will 
translate into decreased complications.
The lack of a survival advantage associated 
with immediate completion lymph-node dissec-
tion in this trial contrasts with the results of the 
MSLT-I. In that trial, patients with nodal disease 
and intermediate-thickness melanomas had bet-
ter outcomes with immediate surgery than with 
delayed surgery. The lack of a survival benefit 
with completion lymph-node dissection in patients 
in MSLT-II suggests that any increase in survival 
with early surgery occurred among patients with 
disease that was limited to the sentinel node. 
Patients with nonsentinel-node metastases may 
still undergo salvage treatment with completion 
lymph-node dissection, but the timing of that 
intervention does not appear to be critical.
Early completion lymph-node dissection did 
not increase survival in the MSLT-II population. 
It is possible that this was due to dilution of a 
therapeutic effect, since approximately three 
quarters of the population did not have mela-
noma in nonsentinel nodes. A comparison of 
results in patients with nonsentinel-node metas-
tases in this trial, similar to the latent subgroup 
analysis in MSLT-I, might address this possibil-
ity, but it would be difficult to accomplish.21 
First, in this population with a low disease 
burden and with the most recent follow-up, ad-
ditional nodal recurrences are expected. Second, 
even at the most recent follow-up, an imbalance 
in the observed proportion of patients with non-
sentinel node–positive disease was noted, with 
an excess in the observation group. This may be

Completion Dissection or Observation in Melanoma
due to small nonsentinel-node metastases that 
were not detected on standard pathological ex-
amination. Intensive evaluation of nonsentinel 
nodes with the use of immunohistochemical 
tests indicates that the frequency of these occult 
metastases in completion lymph-node dissection 
specimens is very similar to that of excess nodal 
recurrences (8 to 10%).18
Overall, some value may be derived from im-
mediate completion lymph-node dissection with 
regard to staging and an increased rate of re-
gional disease control. However, this value comes 
at the cost of increased complications.
