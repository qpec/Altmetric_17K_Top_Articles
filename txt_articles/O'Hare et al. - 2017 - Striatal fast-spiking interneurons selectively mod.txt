Abstract Habit formation is a behavioral adaptation that automates routine actions. Habitual
behavior correlates with broad reconfigurations of dorsolateral striatal (DLS) circuit properties that
increase gain and shift pathway timing. The mechanism(s) for these circuit adaptations are unknown
and could be responsible for habitual behavior. Here we find that a single class of interneuron, fast-
spiking interneurons (FSIs), modulates all of these habit-predictive properties. Consistent with a
role in habits, FSIs are more excitable in habitual mice compared to goal-directed and acute
chemogenetic inhibition of FSIs in DLS prevents the expression of habitual lever pressing. In vivo
recordings further reveal a previously unappreciated selective modulation of SPNs based on their
firing patterns; FSIs inhibit most SPNs but paradoxically promote the activity of a subset displaying
high fractions of gamma-frequency spiking. These results establish a microcircuit mechanism for
habits and provide a new example of how interneurons mediate experience-dependent behavior.

Introduction
Habit formation is an adaptive behavioral response to frequent and positively reinforcing experien-
ces. Once established, habits allow routine actions to be triggered by external cues. This automation
frees cognitive resources that would otherwise process action-outcome relationships underlying
goal-directed behavior. The dorsolateral region of the striatum has been heavily implicated in the
formation and expression of habits through lesion and inactivation studies (Yin et al., 2004;
Yin et al., 2006), in vivo recordings (Tang et al., 2007; Jog et al., 1999), and changes in synaptic
strength (Shan et al., 2015). More recently, properties of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) input-out-
put transformation of afferent activity to striatal projection neuron firing were found to predict the
extent of habitual behavior in individual animals (O’Hare et al., 2016). Despite these observations,
the cellular microcircuit mechanisms driving habitual behavior have not been identified.
DLS output arises from striatal projection neurons (SPNs), which comprise ~95% of striatal neu-
rons and project to either the direct (dSPNs) or indirect (iSPNs) basal ganglia pathways. The proper-
ties of evoked SPN firing ex vivo linearly predict behavior across the goal-directed to habitual
spectrum in an operant lever pressing task (O’Hare et al., 2016). Specifically, habitual responding
correlates with larger evoked responses in both the direct and indirect pathways as well as a shorter
latency to fire of dSPNs relative to iSPNs. To identify a microcircuit mechanism for habitual behavior,
we manipulated the striatal microcircuitry to identify local circuit elements that modulated these
habit-predictive SPN firing properties (Figure 1A,B).

 Glutamatergic corticostriatal synapses express dopamine-dependent forms of long-lasting synap-
tic potentiation and depression (Shen et al., 2008), making these connections a fitting site for expe-
rience-dependent adaptation of striatal output. Although such plasticity accompanies changes in
behavior, including the formation of habits (Shan et al., 2015; Nazzaro et al., 2012), it does not
readily explain the finding that increased gain in the direct and indirect SPNs in habitual mice was
balanced (O’Hare et al., 2016) since synaptic strengthening would occur separately on the two SPN
classes through dichotomous mechanisms (Shen et al., 2008). In addition, within the DLS, habit-pre-
dictive SPN firing properties were distributed uniformly rather than in discrete subpopulations of
SPNs (O’Hare et al., 2016). Because interneurons are often anatomically suited to tune SPN activity
in a similarly broad manner through extensive axonal arbors (Kawaguchi et al., 1995; Tepper et al.,
2010), we hypothesized that plasticity of striatal interneurons might underlie the habit-associated
changes in striatal output.
Among the various interneuron types resident to the striatum (Tepper et al., 2010), parvalbumin-
positive, fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) provide the strongest source of local modulation, exerting
strong, feedforward inhibition of SPNs via perisomatic GABAergic contacts onto virtually all SPNs
(Gittis et al., 2010; Koo
´s and Tepper, 1999; Koos et al., 2004; Mallet, 2005; Taverna et al.,
2007; Straub et al., 2016; Szydlowski et al., 2013). Notably, FSIs are expressed in the dorsal stria-
tum on a mediolateral gradient with the most residing in DLS (Gerfen, 1985). FSIs also preferentially
innervate dSPNs relative to iSPNs (Gittis et al., 2010), suggesting a potential mechanism by which
FSI-mediated inhibition could allow iSPNs to fire before dSPNs in response to coincident excitatory
input. Based on these considerations, we hypothesized that FSIs might drive the habit-predictive cir-
cuit features through a disinhibitory mechanism that would promote SPN firing and a preferentially
earlier activation of the direct pathway. Striatal FSI plasticity has been demonstrated through
eLife digest From biting fingernails to the daily commute, habits are sets of actions that can be
completed almost without thinking and that are difficult to change or stop. Behavioral
neuroscientists refer to habits as “stimulus-response” behaviors, and know that forming a new habit
requires a region deep within the brain called the dorsolateral striatum. Indeed, in this region, the
outgoing neurons – which make up 95% of the cells - respond differently to incoming signals in mice
that have learned habits compared to non-habitual mice. However a question remained: what
exactly was producing these differences?
O’Hare et al. have now found, unexpectedly, that the answer resides not in the 95% of outgoing
neurons, but rather in a rare type of cell known as the fast-spiking interneuron. This cell is connected
to many others and it appears to act like a conductor, orchestrating the previously identified
changes in the output neurons. These findings were made using mice that had been trained to press
a lever for a sugar pellet reward. Habit was measured by how long mice kept pressing even if they
had just been allowed to eat their fill of pellets and the test lever was no longer dispensing pellets.
Habitual mice continue to press the lever in this circumstance, while other mice do not.
O’Hare et al. found that inactivating the “conductor” cell made the output neurons respond in
the opposite way to how they normally respond in habitual mice. Further experiments showed that
fast-spiking interneurons were also more easily activated in habitual mice. To test whether this
putative “conductor” cell was necessary for habitual behaviors, a technique known as
chemogenetics was used to turn down its activity in habitual mice. Indeed, reducing activity in the
conductor cell blocked the habitual behavior.
While some habits are a helpful and economical way to get through daily life, habits are also
thought to be corrupted in a number of diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, addictions
and compulsions. Identifying this specific, yet rare, cell as a critical part of maintaining habits points
out a new target to consider for therapies. Further work is needed before such treatments might
become available to treat habit-related disorders; though O’Hare et al. are now taking steps in this
direction by trying to work out how the fast-spiking interneuron changes its own activity when a
habit is formed.

 experimenter-induced activity and genetic manipulations (Mathur et al., 2013; Winters et al.,
2012; Orduz et al., 2013; Gittis et al., 2011a), but it remains unknown whether dorsal striatal FSIs
undergo plasticity normally in the context of experience-dependent adaptive behavior.
Using pharmacological and optogenetic manipulations, we found that striatal FSIs modulate the
pathway-specific properties of DLS output that predict habitual behavior. Surprisingly though, silenc-
ing FSIs produced the opposite directionality for each habit-predictive circuit feature, suggesting
that an increase, rather than decrease, in FSI activity might drive habitual behavior. Indeed, when FSI
firing was evoked ex vivo by stimulation of cortical afferents, FSIs from habitual mice fired more
readily than FSIs from goal-directed mice. To test the significance of this plasticity for the expression
of habitual behavior, we acutely inhibited FSIs in DLS chemogenetically. Inhibiting FSIs in habit-
trained mice blocked habit expression, but not lever-pressing per se, while identically-trained control
subjects displayed robust habitual behavior. In vivo recordings revealed that the effects of FSI activ-
ity on striatal output appear to be more selective than previously appreciated. While FSIs exert the
expected strongly inhibitory influence over DLS output, they also promote activity in a subset of
SPNs that can be identified a priori based upon individual SPN firing patterns. Our results identify a
mechanism for habit by which FSI strengthening reconfigures DLS output and promotes the expres-
sion of habitual behavior.
Results
Inhibiting fast-spiking interneurons drives a striatal circuit
endophenotype opposite that of habitual behavior
To manipulate FSI activity, the calcium-permeable AMPA receptor (CP-AMPAR) antagonist IEM-
1460, which predominantly weakens excitatory synaptic inputs onto FSIs in striatum (Gittis et al.,
2011b), was used. Striatal FSIs express AMPARs lacking the GluA2 subunit, rendering them perme-
able to calcium (Hollmann et al., 1991), whereas SPNs do not typically express CP-AMPARs. Consis-
tent with this difference in AMPAR subunit expression, IEM-1460 does not affect excitatory synaptic
currents in SPNs but strongly decreases excitatory transmission onto FSIs (Gittis et al., 2011b). Cell-
attached FSI recordings before and after exposure to IEM-1460 (50 mM) confirmed the drug’s

microcircuitry was manipulated in tissue from untrained animals in order to reproduce the known circuit substrate for habitual behavior (described in
O’Hare et al., 2016) and thereby identify a candidate microcircuit mechanism. (C) Representative heat maps of dSPN (x) and iSPN (.) calcium transient

decreased responses after IEM-1460 wash-in (dSPNs: t(22) = 6.43, p=0.0000018, n = 23 cells; iSPNs: t(17) = 3.43, p=0.0032, n = 18 cells) whereas low-
firing SPNs did not (dSPNs: p=0.24, n = 64 cells; iSPNs: p=0.21, n = 34 cells). (E) Linear regression and correlational analyses show that the inhibitory
effect of IEM-1460 on SPN responses (post – baseline difference) is a linear function of baseline response amplitudes for both dSPNs (red; r(86) =

 efficacy to reduce synaptically-evoked AP firing in our acute parasagittal DLS preparation (Figure 1—
figure supplement 1). To first approximate how FSIs modulate the habit-predictive properties of
evoked striatal output, the same ex vivo population calcium imaging approach that identified the
behavior-predictive properties (O’Hare et al., 2016) was used on tissue prepared from untrained
animals (Figure 1A,B). Firing responses evoked by electrical activation of cortical afferents were
measured in dozens of pathway-defined SPNs of both types simultaneously using the calcium indica-
tor dye fura-2AM, the Drd1a-tdTomato (Ade et al., 2011) reporter, and vector-mode two-photon
laser scanning microscopy (2PLSM) (Figure 1A; see Materials and methods and O’Hare et al.,
2016). Action potential responses were detected by cross-correlation analysis with a template wave-
form that was obtained from single-action potential responses during simultaneous cell-attached
electrophysiological recordings for each SPN subtype (see Materials and methods). Contamination
of dSPN and iSPN datasets by interneurons was minimized by selection criteria and monitoring data-
sets for outliers (See Materials and methods for further details).
Firing properties of SPNs were compared within-cell before and after wash-in of IEM-1460. IEM-
1460 decreased the amplitude of evoked calcium transients in both dSPNs (t(86) = 3.42, p=0.001,
n = 87) and iSPNs (t(51) = 2.11, p=0.040, n = 52). IEM-1460 also changed the relative latency to fire
between direct and indirect pathway SPNs by increasing the pre-existing bias in relative pathway
timing whereby iSPNs tend to respond to cortical excitation more quickly than dSPNs (Figure 1F)
(mean absolute latency values for dSPNs: 144.03 ± 7.08 ms ACSF, 154.33 ± 7.92 ms IEM-1460,
N = 87; iSPNs: 130.31 ± 7.87 ms ACSF, 134.43 ± 8.89 ms IEM-1460, N = 52).
Upon closer inspection, the decrease in calcium transient amplitude seen at the population level
appeared to be dominated by the subset of SPNs with larger baseline responses (for example, see
brightest red cells before wash-in in Figure 1C). To determine whether there was selectivity for IEM-
1460’s effects on SPNs with large basal responses, calcium transient amplitude was used as a feature
to classify SPNs as having large or small evoked calcium transients prior to drug wash-in. Rather than
specifying an arbitrary cutoff value for the transient amplitude, we used an unsupervised clustering
algorithm known as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to separate SPNs into two clusters. Based on
calibration data in this preparation demonstrating the relationship between calcium transient ampli-
tude and number of action potentials (O’Hare et al., 2016), the GMM separated SPNs into clusters
corresponding to multi-action potential (larger transients; ‘high-firing’) and single-action potential
(smaller transients; ‘low-firing’) responses (Figure 1D). Compared to the use of a physiologically-
based 0.05 DF/F0 cutoff value, the unbiased GMM classification was in 90.5% agreement. According
to this pre-IEM-1460 categorization, low-firing SPNs were unaffected whereas calcium transient
amplitudes of high-firing SPNs were significantly reduced by IEM-1460 (Figure 1D).
This selective relationship was also borne out by examining the relationship between basal cal-
cium transient amplitude and the magnitude of IEM-1460 effect. Consistent with a selective inhibi-
tion of multi-action potential responses, basal calcium transient amplitudes linearly predicted the
inhibitory effect of IEM-1460 in both SPN subtypes (Figure 1E). Moreover, IEM-1460 did not affect
spike probability in either SPN subtype (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). These pharmacological
experiments in acute brain slices indicate that IEM-1460 promotes an indirect pathway timing advan-
tage and selectively diminishes multi-action potential evoked SPN responses.
Because the within-cell experimental design of measuring effects before and after IEM-1460
application did not exclude the possibility that changes in calcium signals occurred during the 20
min wash-in period independently of IEM-1460, we performed a separate across-group study. Brain
slices were incubated with either IEM-1460 or vehicle prior to and during imaging. Group mean cal-
cium transient amplitudes were lower in IEM-1460 relative to vehicle in both dSPNs (vehicle:
0.043 ± 0.0011 DF/F0, N = 202 cells; IEM-1460: 0.037 ± 0.0021 DF/F0, N = 72 cells; t(272) = 2.62,
p=0.0093) and iSPNs (vehicle: 0.040 ± 0.0014 DF/F0, N = 143 cells; IEM-1460: 0.033 ± 0.0011 DF/F0,
N = 56 cells; t(197) = 2.93, p=0.0038) and IEM-1460-treated slices showed a preference for faster
indirect pathway activation relative to vehicle-treated slices (t(197) = 3.83, p=1.41�10�7, N = 143
and 56 independent dSPN/iSPN pairs). These results are generally consistent with findings from
within-cell pre-post measurements.
To further test whether IEM-1460 selectively inhibited multi-spike SPN responses using methodol-
ogy that did not involve inferring action potentials through calcium imaging, we used conventional
electrophysiological methods to record cortically-evoked SPN firing in cell-attached mode. Brief sin-
gle-pulse electrical stimuli (300–600 ms) were calibrated to elicit a stable multi-action potential

Neuroscience
 response in SPNs prior to taking a baseline measurement. Responses to the same stimulus were
then recorded after wash-in of IEM-1460 or vehicle. Consistent with the calcium imaging results,
IEM-1460 decreased evoked SPN firing (t(7) = 2.37, p=0.029, n = 8) while vehicle had no significant
effect (p=0.76, n = 8). Moreover, the same selectivity for modulating multi-action potential
responses was observed in that the magnitude of IEM-1460’s effect correlated with the size of base-
line responses and there was no effect on single-action potential responses (Figure 1—figure sup-
plement 2). This result confirms that IEM-1460, which inhibits FSI firing (Figure 1—figure
supplement 1), selectively reduces multi-action potential SPN responses to afferent stimulation as
suggested by calcium imaging experiments (Figure 1D,E).
Altogether, this series of experiments identifies a pharmacological agent that potently inhibits FSI
activity and modulates all of the habit-predictive SPN firing properties. These results were surprising
for two reasons. First, rather than a blockade of FSI activity causing disinhibition of SPNs as we had
hypothesized, we found that when FSI activity was reduced, SPN activity was also reduced. This
result suggests that FSI activity is capable of promoting, rather than inhibiting, SPN activity at least
in the acute brain slice preparation. Secondly, although IEM-1460 strikingly affected the same fea-
tures of DLS output that predict the expression of habitual behavior (calcium transient amplitude in
both pathways and relative pathway timing) (O’Hare et al., 2016), the directionality of these effects
was opposite in all measures. Therefore, these results revise the overall hypothesis to involve a gain,
rather than loss, of FSI activity as a candidate mechanism for habitual behavior.
Parvalbumin-positive interneurons selectively promote multi-action
potential SPN responses to cortical excitation ex vivo
While IEM-1460 has been shown to have selective effects on the firing of FSIs in striatum, its effect
of inhibiting AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in cholinergic interneurons
(CINs) (Gittis et al., 2011b) leaves open the possibility that CINs might contribute to our observed
IEM-1460 effects. To isolate the effects of FSIs, the light-activated hyperpolarizing proton pump
Archaerhodopsin-3 fused to green fluorescent protein (Arch-GFP) was Cre-dependently expressed
in parvalbumin (PV)-expressing cells. Pvalb-Cre mice were crossed to a line which Cre-dependently
expressed Arch-GFP (See Materials and methods). Control experiments showed that, as predicted,
532 nm light drove outward currents in FSIs but not SPNs (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Addi-
tionally, Arch expressed in PV+ cells (PV-Arch) abolished high-frequency firing of FSIs in response to
somatic current injection (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) and had no effect on SPN firing in the
same recording configuration (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).
To examine the contribution of FSI activity to SPN firing, cortically-evoked SPN action poten-
tials were recorded in cell-attached mode, as in the cell-attached IEM-1460 experiments, while
nearby PV+ interneurons (~0.5 mm radius from recorded SPN) were silenced in alternating trials
with 532 nm light exposure (Figure 2A). In this configuration, PV-Arch effectively blocked evoked
FSI firing (Figure 2B). We found that optical inhibition of PV+ interneurons reliably decreased
evoked SPN firing (Figure 2C, left and middle panels). Given that IEM-1460 selectively reduced
the probability of multi-action potential SPN responses, we examined whether optical inhibition of
PV+ neurons had a similar selectivity. Analysis of SPN responses by trial (paired consecutive laser
OFF/ON sweeps), rather than by cell, indicated that single-action potential events and failures
were unaffected when FSIs were silenced (Figure 2C, right panel). Moreover, a single-exponential
fit of all trial-by-trial data showed a selective contribution of FSIs to multi-spike SPN responses
(Figure 2C, right panel). Consistent with the IEM-1460 results in 2PLSM calcium imaging
(Figure 1D–E) and cell-attached recording (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) experiments, this
optogenetic result indicates that FSIs promote multi-action potential SPN responses to cortical
excitation in the brain slice and that the effects of IEM-1460 on striatal output occur primarily
through a reduction of striatal FSI activity.
FSIs undergo long-lasting plasticity to become strengthened with habit
formation
While results thus far show that FSIs appear capable of specifically modulating habit-predictive prop-
erties of striatal output, we next examined whether FSI activity was different as a result of experi-
ence. We measured FSI synaptic and cellular electrophysiological properties in DLS brain slices

 prepared from habitual and goal-directed mice. Pvalb-Cre mice were bilaterally injected with AAV5-
Ef1a-DIO-eYFP in the DLS to label PV+ interneurons and subsequently trained on an operant task in
which they learned to press a lever for sucrose pellet rewards. Lever presses were reinforced on a
random interval (RI) schedule to induce habit formation (Dickinson et al., 1983; Hila
´rio et al., 2007)
or on an abbreviated random ratio (RRshort) schedule to produce goal-directed behavior
(O’Hare et al., 2016) (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Habit was measured by evaluating the sen-
sitivity of the learned lever press behavior to devaluation of the sucrose pellet reward. Goal-directed
performance is known to be highly sensitive to outcome devaluation whereas habitual performance
is less sensitive (Dickinson et al., 1983; Hila
´rio et al., 2007; Dickinson, 1985). The sucrose pellet
reward was devalued by inducing sensory-specific satiety. Specifically, mice were pre-fed with the
reward pellets or, as a control for general satiety-related behavioral changes, identically-sized normal
grain pellets. On separate but consecutive days, mice were alternately pre-fed 1.3 g of either the
sucrose pellet reward (devalued condition) or the grain-only pellet (non-devalued condition), coun-
terbalancing which pre-feed condition was tested first. Lever press rates were then measured during
brief 3 min probe tests without reinforcement. Habitual behavior was quantified in individual mice as

 the log2 ratio of the devalued versus non-devalued lever press rates (normalized devalued lever
press rate; NDLPr). RI-trained mice with an NDLPr � 0, that is, insensitive to outcome devaluation,
were considered to be habitual. RRshort-trained mice with an NDLPr < 0 were considered to be
goal-directed (Figure 3—figure supplement 1, shaded regions). Mice not meeting either inclusion
criterion were not used for the electrophysiological studies.
We first examined whether excitatory synaptic transmission onto FSIs was altered with habit for-
mation. Spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) were recorded in the presence of the GABAA receptor antag-
onist picrotoxin (50 mM). No difference was detected in sEPSC frequency or amplitude between
goal-directed and habitual FSIs (Figure 3A). Additionally, paired-pulse ratios of evoked EPSCs mea-
sured at a 50 ms inter-stimulus interval were similar between groups (Figure 3B). During these
recordings, we also did not observe any group differences in a number of passive membrane proper-
ties (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).
Rather than changes in synaptic strength, we instead found robust differences in FSI firing
responses to somatic current injection. FSIs from habitual mice displayed higher firing rates com-
pared to FSIs from goal-directed mice (Figure 3C). Action potential kinetics did not appear to
explain these group differences in firing rates as action potential waveforms were not appreciably
different between groups (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). However, the duration over which firing
could be sustained markedly differed between the two behavioral groups (Figure 3D). The majority
of FSIs from goal-directed mice were unable to maintain high-frequency firing for the entire duration
of the 500 ms current injection (<250 ms of firing in 10/15 cells) whereas nearly all FSIs from habitual
mice maintained such activity (>450 ms firing in 7/9 cells). Interestingly, the distribution of goal-
directed FSI response durations was strongly bimodal whereas that of habitual FSI response dura-
tions was not (Figure 3D). The group difference in response durations explained the difference in fir-
ing rates between FSIs of habitual and goal-directed mice since, when firing rates were normalized
to the duration of firing instead of duration of the current step, there was no longer a group differ-
ence in firing rate (Figure 3E).
Habitual behavior was associated with increased FSI firing in response to somatic current injec-
tion. However, it was afferent activation that initially revealed habit-predictive striatal output proper-
ties (O’Hare et al., 2016). Therefore, in order for FSI plasticity to alter striatal output, it must be
sufficient to differentially drive FSI firing in response to similar coincident synaptic excitation. FSI fir-
ing was monitored in cell-attached mode in response to electrical stimulation of excitatory afferents.
We found that FSIs of habitual mice fired more readily than those from mice with goal-directed
behavior (Figure 3F). This habit-related difference in FSI excitability was not readily explained by
other aspects of lever pressing performance including the total number of lever presses or rewards
delivered over the course of training (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). We noted the apparent
bimodal distribution of total rewards delivered for goal-directed subjects (p=0.013, Hartigans’ dip
test; Figure 3—figure supplement 1) and wondered if the number of rewards received by an animal
was related to the similarly-distributed FSI response durations to current injection (Figure 3D).
Instead, we found that response durations from both modes of the distribution were commonly
found in FSIs from the same goal-directed mouse (for example, 494.7 and 180.9 ms). Together,
these experiments show that FSIs undergo long-lasting, experience-dependent plasticity with habit
formation and that this plasticity is sufficient to increase FSI firing.
FSI activity is required for the expression of a learned habit
Since photo-inhibiting FSIs produces striatal output properties that directly oppose those seen in
habit (Figure 1), we inhibited FSIs after habit training to determine the necessity of FSI activity for
expression of habitual behavior. Mice underwent habit-training protocols in the operant lever press
task and then, prior to testing the degree of habitual responding, FSIs were inhibited chemogeneti-
cally. We selected a chemogenetic approach to allow for continuous modulation of activity during
the 3 min probe tests which measure habitual behavior. Drd1a-tdTomato::Pvalb-Cre mice were bilat-
erally injected in DLS with AAV vectors Cre-dependently encoding either the inhibitory hM4D che-
mogenetic receptor (Armbruster et al., 2007) (PV-hM4D) or eYFP (PV-eYFP) (Figure 4A,B). Both
groups underwent the same habit-promoting RI reinforcement protocol and learned similarly
(Figure 4C). For both the devalued and non-devalued conditions, after each pre-feeding period and
thirty minutes prior to the outcome devaluation probe tests, the hM4D agonist clozapine N-oxide
(CNO, 5 mg/kg) was delivered intraperitoneally (Figure 4D).

 Chemogenetic inhibition of PV+ interneurons did not affect operant behavior in general, as evi-
denced by indistinguishable lever press rates between groups in the non-devalued (grain pellets)
condition (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). In contrast, a comparison of sensitivity to outcome
devaluation between groups revealed that habit expression was suppressed in PV-hM4D mice rela-
tive to PV-eYFP controls (Figure 4E). Mean NDLPr for RI-trained PV-eYFP control mice measured at
0.46 ± 0.27, indicating that control mice were insensitive to outcome devaluation, i.e. habitual. By
contrast, PV-hM4D mice, which received the same RI training schedule and showed comparable
rates of lever pressing (Figure 4C), displayed a mean NDLPr of �0.60 ± 0.30. A negative NLDPr indi-
cates sensitivity to outcome devaluation, i.e. goal-directed responding. These findings show that
acute suppression of FSI activity in DLS causes habit-trained subjects to behave as though they were
goal-directed.
FSIs exert an inhibitory net effect on striatal output in vivo while
paradoxically promoting activity in subsets of high-bursting SPNs
To understand how chemogenetic suppression of FSI firing affects striatal activity in vivo, single unit
recordings were performed in a cohort of Drd1a-tdTomato::Pvalb-Cre mice implanted in DLS with
multi-electrode arrays and injected with the Cre-dependent hM4D inhibitory chemogenetic virus.
Single units corresponding to both FSIs and SPNs were recorded in freely-moving mice (Figure 5A–
D) for 30 min before intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of CNO (5 mg/kg) or vehicle and during the

 period of 30–60 min after injection. As expected for the inhibitory hM4D receptor, CNO significantly
decreased FSI firing rates compared to vehicle-injected controls (CNO: 59.61 ± 8.08% baseline; vehi-
cle: 86.89 ± 11.66% baseline) (Figure 5E). In line with previous ex vivo (Koo
´s and Tepper, 1999;
Koos et al., 2004) and in vivo (Mallet, 2005; Gittis et al., 2011b) studies, we further found that sup-
pressing FSI activity caused an overall increase in SPN firing (i.e. disinhibitory effect) relative to vehi-
cle (CNO: 472.00 ± 149.12%; vehicle: 188.02 ± 45.94%; Figure 5F).
In contrast to the straightforward effect of CNO on FSI activity, the effect of CNO injection on
SPNs was far more variable. Post-CNO SPN firing rates ranged from 32.5% to 2511.1% of baseline
(CV = 147%) with 26% of SPNs displaying negative modulation. In acute slice experiments, FSIs had
displayed an unexpected and selective effect of promoting multi-action potential responses
(Figures 1D,E and 2C) but not otherwise affecting spike probability (Figure 1—figure supplement
1). To assess whether FSIs also promoted activity in identifiable subsets of SPNs in vivo, we analyzed
the baseline firing patterns in single SPNs prior to CNO injection. SPN spiking was categorized into
discrete frequency bands by deriving instantaneous firing rate from interspike intervals (ISIs) and was
then normalized to total number of ISIs for each single unit. This analysis defined the fraction of ISIs
corresponding to each frequency band for each SPN and was independent of local field potentials.

 We found that the baseline (pre-CNO) fraction of ISIs falling within the highest rate frequency
band, gamma-frequency (30–100 Hz), linearly predicted how firing rates in individual SPNs changed
when FSI activity was suppressed (Figure 5G, left; see Figure 5—figure supplement 1 for example
units). That is, the higher the fraction of gamma-frequency spikes an SPN fired, the more likely it was
to fire less when FSIs were chemogenetically inhibited. No such relationship was observed in
response to vehicle (Figure 5G, right).
Since neurons with higher firing rates would be expected to have shorter ISIs in general, we
examined the possibility that the fraction of gamma ISIs in SPNs might simply relate to mean firing
rate. However, we found that the proportion of gamma-frequency ISIs was unrelated to mean firing
rate in baseline single unit SPN recordings before either CNO or vehicle administration (pre-CNO:
p=0.25, n = 23; pre-vehicle: p=0.28, n = 20). Additionally, we found that SPNs fire significantly more
gamma-frequency spikes than expected by Poisson processes matched to firing rate (pre-CNO: t(44)
= 5.76, p=7.67�10�7, n = 23 SPNs and rate-matched simulations; pre-vehicle: t(38) = 8.24,
p=5.59�10�10, n = 20 SPNs and rate-matched simulations). Whereas baseline firing rates non-specif-
ically predict fold change in firing rate after both CNO and vehicle injection (CNO: r(22) = �0.61,
p=0.0022, n = 23; vehicle: r(19) = �0.45, p=0.045, n = 20), the excess probability of gamma-fre-
quency ISIs (observed – expected) specifically predicts rate modulation after CNO (r(22) = �0.52,
p=0.011, n = 23) but not vehicle (r(19) = 0.045, p=0.85, n = 20). Directly comparing correlation coef-
ficients using Fisher r-to-z transformations showed that baseline firing rates did not predict SPN rate
modulation by CNO better than by vehicle (z = �0.68, p=0.25) whereas baseline excess gamma spe-
cifically predicted modulation by CNO (z = �1.88, p=0.030). Therefore, gamma-frequency spiking
represents a feature of interest in SPNs that predicts whether these output neurons will fire more or
less as a consequence of reducing FSI activity.
These results demonstrate that FSIs modulate SPN activity in a more complicated manner than
previously appreciated. While FSIs can have an overall strongly inhibitory effect in vivo on SPN firing
as traditionally assumed, we also found evidence that they potentiate activity in a select population
of SPNs that displays higher fractions of gamma-frequency spiking. This selective potentiation may
be akin to a winner-take-all ‘focusing’ mechanism that increases the signal-to-noise ratio in cortico-
striatal transmission. According to such a mechanism, the subset of recruited SPNs would be facili-
tated while the less-relevant SPNs with low fractions of gamma spiking would be suppressed.
Discussion
With the recent availability of tools to study specific, genetically-defined types of neurons, critical
roles for interneurons in facilitating behavioral adaptations to experience are becoming increasingly
apparent. In brain regions other than the striatum, interneuron activity appears to most commonly
serve as a gate for the induction of long-lasting plasticity elsewhere in the local circuitry
(Kuhlman et al., 2013; Kvitsiani et al., 2013; Wolff et al., 2014; Yazaki-Sugiyama et al., 2009).
Although the potential for FSIs themselves to exhibit long-lasting activity-dependent plasticity is
well-documented in acute brain slice experiments (Mathur et al., 2013; Orduz et al., 2013;
Hainmu
¨ller et al., 2014; Sarihi et al., 2012; Dehorter et al., 2015), we are aware of only one report
in which these interneurons were found to undergo experience-dependent plasticity and contribute
to the expression of an adaptive behavior or memory (Donato et al., 2013). Here we provide the
first such example for striatal interneurons. We find that FSIs are a site of adaptive plasticity that
drives circuit and behavioral hallmarks of habit. The habit-associated changes in FSI excitability
appear distinct (Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplement 1) from previously reported plasticity pro-
cesses which included activity-induced changes in FSI-SPN synapses selectively at direct pathway
SPNs (Mathur et al., 2013) and changes in firing rate related to the modulation of afterhyperolariza-
tion currents by parvalbumin expression levels (Orduz et al., 2013). Further characterizing the plas-
ticity mechanisms we find in habit represents an important area for future research as it may reveal a
useful target for pharmacological modulation of FSI activity.
The approach we took to reveal the microcircuit mechanisms for habit was to identify a potential
source for the broad local DLS circuit reorganizations of SPN firing properties that strongly correlate
with habit (Figure 1A,B). To do this, we first examined how FSIs influenced striatal output using a
pharmacological approach that inhibits excitatory synapses on striatal FSIs (and also CINs). In brain
slices from untrained mice, IEM-1460 treatment showed striking specificity in that it modulated all of

 the previously described (O’Hare et al., 2016) habit-predictive properties of evoked SPN firing ex
vivo: gain of dSPN and iSPN responses (Figure 1D,E), and the relative timing of firing between
dSPNs and iSPNs (Figure 1F). IEM-1460 also showed specificity in that it did not affect properties
such as spike probability (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) that are not predictive of habit.
Unexpectedly, we found that the directionality by which FSIs modulated these properties was
opposite to our original hypothesis: instead of the expected disinhibition of SPNs, silencing FSIs
reduced SPN output (Figure 1B–E). FSI inhibition also altered the timing of direct and indirect path-
way neuron firing in a direction that opposed the habit circuit signature (Figure 1B,F) and closely
resembled previous observations in lever-press trained, goal-directed mice (O’Hare et al., 2016).
This suggests that, in DLS, relative pathway timing is altered with habit formation but not with requi-
site goal-directed learning. Thus, the modest nature of the timing shift after pharmacological FSI
blockade in untrained mice is likely due to a floor effect. Altogether, the observed effects of FSIs on
SPNs lead to the prediction that an increase in FSI activity with habit formation would generate the
evoked SPN properties that correlate with habit behavior (Figure 1B) (O’Hare et al., 2016). Accord-
ingly, in habitual mice, we found that FSI firing was increased, and under the same cortical afferent
stimulation conditions that evoke habit-predictive SPN firing properties (Figure 3F). This series of
observations leads to a model of the striatal circuit basis for habitual behavior whereby habit forma-
tion is accompanied by a long-lasting increase in FSI excitability. In this setting, incoming cortical
activity would be predicted to recruit more FSI activity that would in turn drive more firing of SPNs
and shift their latencies such that direct pathway SPNs would tend to fire relatively sooner.
While anatomical and electrophysiological studies have long supported that striatal FSIs are criti-
cal for striatal circuit function (Gittis et al., 2010; Koo
´s and Tepper, 1999; Koos et al., 2004; Mal-
let, 2005; Taverna et al., 2007; Straub et al., 2016; Szydlowski et al., 2013), an understanding of
their specific behavioral contributions is much less developed. Prior in vivo studies have identified
correlations of FSI activity with behaviors involving choice and reward-related actions (Gage et al.,
2010; Schmitzer-Torbert and Redish, 2008), while more recent correlations of FSI activity with
head movement velocity suggest another mechanism (Kim et al., 2014). In the present study, by
chemogenetically inhibiting PV+ interneurons in vivo, we found that FSI activity in DLS is required for
the expression of a learned habit (Figure 4E); an automated, reward-insensitive behavior quite dif-
ferent from behaviors previously studied. Previous pharmacological inactivation studies have demon-
strated a role for DLS in habit expression (Packard and McGaugh, 1996; Zapata et al., 2010),
indicating that general disruption of DLS activity also impairs established habitual behavior. Interest-
ingly, in the present study, chemogenetic inhibition of FSI activity drove an overall increase in projec-
tion neuron activity (Figure 5F) which suggests that reducing FSI activity specifically may impair
habit expression differently than a general inactivation of the circuitry.
While the disruption of habit by chemogenetically inhibiting FSIs supports a critical role for FSIs in
this behavior, this experiment does not identify FSI plasticity as a mechanism for the expression of
habit since artificially manipulating the activity of any cell that plays an otherwise critical role in the
function of an implicated brain region might similarly disrupt behavior. Rather, in this study, a spe-
cific role for FSI plasticity as a mechanism for habit expression is indicated by the observations that
these interneurons modulate those specific striatal output properties that correlate with habit (Fig-
ure 1 and 2) and show long-lasting changes in excitability after habit learning (Figure 3D,F).
Using opto- and chemo-genetic manipulations, we further found that FSIs, which are GABAergic,
enhance activity in subsets of SPNs both in the acute slice and in vivo. Although it is unclear what if
any relationship exists between the SPN subpopulations identified ex vivo versus in vivo, there exist
multiple intriguing parallels. In the acute slice, only activity of those SPNs which displayed burst-like,
multi-action potential responses to single-pulse stimuli (‘high-firing’ SPNs) was suppressed when FSIs
were silenced (Figures 1D,E and 2C). In vivo, the activity of SPNs showing the highest fractions of
gamma-frequency spiking was suppressed, instead of disinhibited, when FSI activity was chemoge-
netically reduced (Figure 5G). In both cases, the SPNs were distinguished by a higher propensity for
burst-like firing patterns. It was further notable that the fraction of SPNs negatively modulated by
reduced FSI activity was similar in both preparations (29% ex vivo compared to 26% in vivo). Con-
versely, we also found that less-active SPNs were not significantly modulated in the slice
(Figures 1D,E and 2C) and SPNs with less gamma-frequency spiking were disinhibited in vivo when
FSI activity was reduced (Figure 5G). This finding is reminiscent of a previous in vivo report that
SPNs with weaker responses to cortical microstimulation displayed the most marked disinhibition

 upon GABAA receptor blockade (Mallet, 2005). An important future direction will be to determine
whether there are unique biological properties that distinguish the subset of SPNs whose activity is
promoted, as opposed to inhibited, by FSIs.
Although an activity-promoting effect of GABAergic FSIs may appear counterintuitive, previous
computational (Humphries et al., 2009) and biological (Bracci and Panzeri, 2006) studies describe
such a phenomenon based in part on the ‘up’ and ‘down’ resting membrane potential states of
SPNs that straddle the chloride reversal potential (ECl-). While a voltage-dependent excitatory effect
of GABA would not necessarily affect spike probability due to a concurrent decrease in membrane
resistance and the disparity between ECl- and spike threshold, such an effect could boost the gluta-
mate-driven depolarization of an SPN in its down state (Humphries et al., 2009; Bracci and Panzeri,
2006). Although disynaptic interneuron microcircuitry is a more common mechanism for disinhibitory
effects of interneurons in other brain regions (Wolff et al., 2014; Lovett-Barron et al., 2012), some
of our observations such as the influence of FSIs on SPN initial latency to fire (Figure 1F) are not con-
sistent with the time delay necessitated by a disynaptic microcircuitry. For this reason, we instead
favor a monosynaptic mechanism whereby properties of SPN resting membrane potential and firing
patterns interact to yield activity-promoting effects of FSIs on SPN subsets.
Based on the previous observation that habit-predictive striatal output properties are relatively
uniformly distributed when elicited by strong bulk stimulation of cortical afferents (O’Hare et al.,
2016), it became apparent that habit-related adaptations of DLS broadly augment the propagation
of cortical excitation into the basal ganglia. To confer specificity for certain actions, additional circuit
dynamics would ostensibly be required. We hypothesized that such specificity could arise from the
activation of subsets of task-specific cortical neuron projections that would in turn activate task-spe-
cific SPNs (Rothwell et al., 2015; Carelli and West, 1991; Gremel et al., 2016). Indeed, recent evi-
dence suggests that spatially-clustered SPN activity encodes information relevant to locomotor
behavior (Barbera et al., 2016). In habits, one possible mechanism then is that task-specific cortical
commands drive (Smith et al., 2012), or at least initiate (Berke et al., 2004), high-frequency firing in
a cluster/subset of SPNs that would then be preferentially excited by FSIs. Additionally, in such a
mechanism, feed-forward inhibition of less-active SPNs (Mallet, 2005) by FSIs might then serve as a
selective filter to further enhance signal-to-noise ratio in corticostriatal transmission. One testable
prediction of this model is that different behaviors would reveal different subsets of gamma-rich
SPNs whose activity is promoted by FSIs.
Lastly, it is notable that FSIs are also implicated in some pathological settings associated with
compulsive behavior. For example, fewer striatal FSIs, as determined by parvalbumin-immunopositiv-
ity, have been observed in human brains from individuals with Tourette’s syndrome (Kalanithi et al.,
2005) and mouse brains in a model of OCD-like behavior (Burguie
`re et al., 2013). OCD is highly
comorbid in Tourette’s syndrome (Sheppard et al., 1999) and disrupted habit learning has been
implicated in pathological compulsivity in a variety of settings (Graybiel, 2008; Everitt and Robbins,
2005; Gerdeman et al., 2003). Interestingly, since both of the above studies defined FSIs by parval-
bumin immunoreactivity, an intriguing alternative view of those results is that parvalbumin levels are
below detection threshold but cell number is not necessarily reduced. Lower parvalbumin levels are
associated with a hyperexcitable FSI phenotype (Orduz et al., 2013), which is akin to the direction
of FSI plasticity we associate with habit in the present study. Thus, the finding of increased FSI excit-
ability as a plasticity mechanism driving habitual responding also yields new insights to the potential
mechanistic relatedness of habit and compulsion.
Materials and methods
Animals
All experiments were carried out under approved animal protocols in accordance with Duke Univer-
sity Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee standards. Mice were 2–4 months of age, in C57Bl/
6 genetic background, and were hemi-/heterozygous for all transgenes. Drd1a-tdTomato line 6 BAC
transgenic mice were generated in our laboratory (RRID: IMSR_JAX:016204) (Ade et al., 2011). To
optically inhibit PV+ interneurons, a mouse line expressing Cre under control of the Parvalbumin
(Pvalb) promoter (RRID:IMSR_JAX:012358) was crossed to the Ai35D line from Jackson Laboratory
which

 + interneurons with Cre-dependent viral vectors, the Drd1a-tdTomato mouse line was crossed to the
Pvalb-Cre line to produce experimental progeny hemizygous for Drd1a-tdTomato and heterozygous
for Pvalb-Cre. For identification of PV+ neurons in 2PLSM calcium imaging experiments, the Pvalb-
Cre mouse line was crossed to the Ai9 line (RRID:IMSR_JAX:007909) which Cre-dependently
expressed tdTomato.
Viral vectors
The CAG-FLEX-rev-hM4D:2a:GFP plasmid was provided by the Sternson laboratory at Janelia Farm
(Addgene #52536). UNC Viral Vector Core packaged this plasmid into AAV 2/5 and also provided
AAV2/5-EF1a-DIO-eYFP. All viral aliquots had titers above 1 � 1012 particles/mL.
Intracranial viral injections
Stereotaxic injections were carried out on 2–3 month old Drd1a-tdTomato::Pvalb-Cre mice under
isoflurane anesthesia (4% induction, 0.5–1.0% maintenance). Meloxicam (2 mg/kg) was administered
subcutaneously after anesthesia induction and prior to surgical procedures for postoperative pain
relief. Small craniotomies were made over the injection sites and 1.0 mL virus was delivered bilaterally
to dorsolateral striatum via a Nanoject II (Drummond Scientific) at a rate of 0.1 mL/min. The injection
pipette was held in place for 5 min following injection and then slowly removed. Coordinates for all
injections relative to bregma were as follows: A/P: +0.8 mm, M/L: ±2.7–2.8 mm, D/V: 3.2 mm. Mice
were allowed a minimum of 14 days recovery before behavioral training. For experiments involving
chemogenetic inhibition of FSIs specifically in DLS, mice showing no expression or poor targeting
(misses were medial to DLS) were excluded from the study prior to behavioral analysis and data
unblinding. Two AAV2/5-CAG-FLEX-rev-hM4D:2a:GFP-injected mice showed expression in only one
hemisphere of DLS. These mice were included for behavioral analysis and behaved no differently
from bilaterally-infected mice. We note that exclusion of these two subjects does not affect the sta-
tistical significance of the result.
Lever press training
Prior to training, animals were restricted to 85–90% baseline weight to motivate learning. Lever
presses were rewarded with sucrose-containing pellets (Bio-serv, F05684) and grain-only pellets (Bio-
serv, F05934) were used as a sensory-specific control for satiety. Mice were trained in Med Associ-
ates operant chambers housed within light-resistant, sound-attenuating cabinets (ENV-022MD).
Lever presses and food cup entries were recorded by Med-PC-IV software. During RR reinforcement,
pellets were delivered every X times on average for an RR-X schedule. RI reinforcement gave a 10%
probability of reward every X seconds for an RI-X schedule. Following random reinforcement train-
ing, subjects underwent devaluation testing to measure habitual behavior as previously described
(O’Hare et al., 2016). When training schedule was a variable, experiments were performed with
experimenter blind to training schedule.
For electrophysiological assessment of FSI properties, acute brain slices were prepared 0–24 hr
after the final training session. Mice were excluded from analysis if they did not display the behavior
that was expected based on training schedule. Specifically, mice that were trained to be habitual
(random interval reinforcement) yet showed sensitivity to outcome devaluation (NDLPr <0) were
excluded.
Brain slice preparation
Animals were anesthetized using 2,2,2-tribromoethanol and transcardially perfused with ice-cold N-
Methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG) solution (Ting et al., 2014). Brains were quickly removed and 300 mm
thick parasaggital sections were cut in NMDG solution using a Leica VT1200S. For electrophysiologi-
cal experiments, slices recovered at 32˚C in NMDG solution for 10–12 min and were then transferred
to room temperature HEPES-containing holding solution (Ting et al., 2014) where they remained for
the rest of the experiment. Slices remained undisturbed in the HEPES holding solution for at least
one hour prior to recording. For 2PLSM calcium imaging experiments, slices were allowed to recover
for approximately 45 min in NMDG solution at room temperature. Slices were then transferred to
room temperature HEPES holding solution (Ting et al., 2014) shortly before bulk-loading with fura-
2, AM. Cutting and holding solutions were calibrated to 305 ± 1 mOsm/L. ACSF was calibrated to

 305 ± 1 mOsm/L for 2PLSM calcium imaging and 315 ± 2 mOsm/L for electrophysiological record-
ings with internal solutions at 295 mOsm/L. Solutions were pH 7.3–7.4 and were carbogenated to
saturation at all times.
Drugs
For electrophysiological recordings, IEM-1460 was dissolved in deionized, distilled water at 100 mM
and added to carbogenated ACSF for a final concentration of 50 mM. Picrotoxin was dissolved at
200 mM in DMSO and added to ACSF at 50 mM. For behavioral experiments, CNO was dissolved to
10 mg/mL in DMSO and diluted in sterile 0.9% saline solution to administer 5 mg/kg per subject
with a maximum injection volume of 0.5 mL. For in vivo electrophysiological recordings, CNO and
vehicle were administered on different days and in counterbalanced order.
Electrophysiological recordings
Data were acquired using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and a Digidata 1440A
digitizer (Axon Instruments). Data were digitized at 10–20 kHz and low-pass filtered at 2 kHz. Boro-
silicate glass pipettes were pulled to 2–5 MW resistance. Slices were continuously perfused with car-
bogenated ACSF (124 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2�6 H2O, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.2 mM
NaH2PO4, 10 mM glucose, 4 mM CaCl2) at a temperature of 29–31˚C.
Current clamp experiments
Fast-spiking interneurons were identified by Cre-dependent fluorescence as well as their characteris-
tically narrow action potential half-width. Current clamp (and cell-attached) recordings were carried
out using a potassium methansulfonate-based internal solution (140 mM KMeSO4, 7.5 mM NaCl, 10
mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM EGTA, 4.2 mM ATP�Mg, 0.4 mM GTP�Na3).
Voltage clamp experiments
Fast-spiking interneurons were identified by Cre-dependent fluorescence as well as previously
reported ranges for input resistance and whole cell capacitance (Gittis et al., 2010). Voltage clamp
recordings were carried out using a cesium methansulfonate-based internal solution (120 mM CsOH,
120 mM MeSO4, 15 mM CsCl, 8 mM NaCl, 10 mM TEA-Cl, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM QX-314, 4 mM
ATP�Mg, 0.3 mM GTP�Na3).
Cell-attached experiments
Stimuli were delivered to cortical afferent fibers at the cortical side of the internal capsule
(Figure 2A) using a bipolar stimulating electrode (FHC, CBARC75). Responses in SPNs and FSIs
were recorded in cell-attached configuration with voltage clamped at 0 mV. Leak current was contin-
uously monitored to detect partial break-ins. In the event of a partial membrane rupture, leak cur-
rents increased significantly due to the voltage at which the membrane patch was clamped. In these
events, data were discarded. The same potassium methansulfonate-based internal solution as in the
current clamp experiments was used to enable break-in and cell type identification or further record-
ings after cell-attached experiments concluded. All stimuli were delivered with a 20 s inter-stimulus
interval. For input-output experiments, 300 ms single-pulse stimuli were delivered with 5 sweeps per
intensity, in order from weakest to strongest intensity, and cells were recorded at a consistent dis-
tance from the stimulating electrode (600–650 mm). For pre-post experiments with application of
IEM-1460, 300–600 ms single-pulse stimuli were delivered to drive multi-action potential responses
prior to drug wash-in. 10 sweeps were analyzed as baseline and another 10 sweeps, using the same
stimulus parameters, following a 20 min wash-in period were analyzed to measure drug effect.
In vitro optical inhibition of FSIs
532 nm light was delivered from a diode-pumped solid state laser (Opto Engine) coupled to a 300
mm core, 0.39 NA patch cable which terminated into a 2.5 mm ferrule (Thorlabs Inc.). The ferrule was
submerged in the perfusion chamber and positioned with a micromanipulator to illuminate a ~0.5
mm radius around the tip of the recording pipet. Laser onset coincided with electrical stimulation of
cortical afferents. Laser stimulation lasted 500 ms in whole cell current clamp experiments and 1 s
when monitoring synaptically-evoked responses in cell-attached mode.

 In vivo single-unit recordings
Custom-made multi-electrode arrays were used for all recordings. The arrays consisted of fine-cut
tungsten wires and a 6-cm-long silver grounding wire. Tungsten wires were 35 mm in diameter and 6
mm in length, arranged in a 4 � 4 configuration. The row spacing was 150 mm, and electrode spac-
ing was 150 mm. All arrays were attached to the 16-channel Omnetics connector and fixed to the
skull with dental acrylic. After hM4D viral injection into the dorsolateral striatum, the electrode arrays
were lowered at the following stereotaxic coordinates in relation to bregma: 0.8 rostral, 2.75 lateral,
and 2.6 mm below brain surface. Single-unit activity was recorded with miniaturized wireless head-
stages (Triangle BioSystems International) using the Cerebus data acquisition system (Blackrock
Microsystems), as previously described (Fan et al., 2011). The chronically implanted electrode array
was connected to a wireless transmitter cap (~3.8 g). During recording sessions, single units were
selected using online sorting. Infrared reflective markers (6.35 mm diameter) were affixed to record-
ing headstages to track mouse position as subjects moved freely on a raised platform. Marker posi-
tion was monitored at 100 Hz sampling rate by eight Raptor-H Digital Cameras (MotionAnalysis
Corp.). Before data analysis, the waveforms were sorted again using Offline Sorter (Plexon). Only sin-
gle-unit activity with a clear separation from noise was used for the data analysis. In each case, a unit
was only included if action potential amplitude was �5 times that of the noise band. FSIs and SPNs
were classified on the basis of spike width and baseline firing rate (Figure 5B–D).
2PLSM calcium imaging of DLS output
Synaptically-evoked action potential firing was monitored in dozens of direct and indirect pathway
SPNs simultaneously as previously described (O’Hare et al., 2016) in acute brain slices prepared
from untrained Drd1a-tdTomato hemizygous mice (Ade et al., 2011) aged 2–4 months. Detailed
methods are included below.
Bulk-loading of fura-2, AM
Fura-2, AM (Life Technologies, F-1221) was dissolved in a solution of 20% pluronic acid F-127
(Sigma) in DMSO by vortexing and sonication. The solution was then filtered through a microcentri-
fuge tube. Slices were transferred to small loading chambers with room temperature ACSF + 2.5
mM probenecid (osmolality and pH readjusted to 305 ± 1 and 7.3–7.4). 1.1 mL fura-2, AM solution
was slowly painted directly onto the striatum of each slice. Additional fura-2 AM solution was added
as needed to reach a final DMSO concentration of 0.1% by volume. Slices were incubated in a dark
environment for 1 hr at 32–33˚ with continuous carbogenation of the loading chambers. The pro-
longed 1 hr incubation was found to be necessary for satisfactory loading in acute slices prepared
from adult and aging animals.
Selecting field of view
After the incubation period, slices were moved to carbogenated HEPES holding solution. Slices
remained in holding solution until used for an experiment, at which point they were moved to a record-
ing chamber and continuously perfused with carbogenated ACSF (124 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 1 mM
MgCl2�6 H2O, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM glucose, 4 mM CaCl2) at a temperature of
29–31˚C. To evoke SPN responses, cortical afferents were stimulated in bulk by a bipolar concentric
electrode (FHC, CBARC75) placed at the dorsoanterior edge of the internal capsule (Figure 1A). A
410 � 410 mm field of view (FoV) was selected by following the cortical fibers along a diagonal ventro-
posterior path from the electrode at a distance of 600–650 mm. At this distance, SPN action potentials
can be evoked without the cells being directly depolarized (O’Hare et al., 2016). Fura-2 and tdTomato
(expressed in dSPNs) were excited simultaneously at 750 nm (fura-2 isosbestic wavelength) using a Ti:
Sapphire laser (Chameleon Ultra 1, Coherent Inc.). Red and green photons were collected by separate
photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) both above and below the microscope stage.
Classifying regions of interest
Regions of interest (ROIs) showing red and green were classified as dSPNs whereas green-only ROIs
were classified as iSPNs (O’Hare et al., 2016). The small percentage of green-only cells which would
have been striatal interneurons was partially mitigated by ignoring abnormally large ROIs which
were likely to be cholinergic interneurons. FSIs comprise approximately 1% of all striatal neurons

 and are not present in the Drd1a-TdTomato labelled population (Ade et al., 2011). However, FSIs
might be included in the ‘putative iSPN’ population. Empiric experiments using Pv-Cre x Ai9
reporter mice demonstrate that approximately 50% of FSIs are labelled with fura2-AM and pass data
inclusion criteria in our experimental setting (see Figure 6). Therefore, we expect at most that
approximately 1% of iSPN and none of dSPN data may represent FSIs. Because CIN and FSI firing
properties are very different from SPNs, we reviewed our data sets for the presence of outliers using

 Robust regression and Outlier (ROUT) analysis (GraphPad Prism software) and a false discovery rate
of Q = 1%. No outliers were detected in iSPN baseline amplitude, post-IEM-1460 amplitude, or
latency modulation datasets of Figure 1.
Population imaging of evoked SPN calcium transients
ROIs were manually selected in ImageJ until no ROIs remained in the FoV. A matrix of ROI centroid
coordinates was then imported to PrairieView to generate a linescan vector. If temporal resolution
for the linescan vector fell below the minimum of 12 Hz due to an overabundance of ROIs (and thus
lengthy vector), they were removed in order of increasing light intensity in the green channel. Cen-
troid coordinates were permanently attributed to each ROI in order to retain spatial information
along with SPN subtype and firing properties. Fura-2 signal was measured at each ROI along the
scan path at 770 nm in response to 300 ms, 300 mA single-pulse stimulation of cortical afferents.
Images were acquired at a frequency of 12–15 Hz. A diffractive optical element was used to increase
signal-to-noise (SLH-505D-0.23–785, Coherent Inc.) (Watson et al., 2009). Photons were collected
by a 40X, 0.8 NA LUMPlanFL water immersion objective lens and Aplanat/Achromatic 1.4 NA oil
immersion condenser (Olympus). Red and green photons were directed to dedicated PMTs by a 575
nm dichroic mirror. Images were acquired via PrarieView image acquisition software and were time-
locked to stimuli by Trigger Sync (Bruker Corp.). Stimuli were delivered 10 times with a 20 s intersti-
mulis interval. For each ROI, firing properties were calculated at the single-trial level before being
averaged across trials.
Data analysis
All experiments and data analyses were performed with experimenter blind to the experimental vari-
able (e.g. viral construct, training schedule). A priori sample sizes were established based on power
analyses. Data exclusion criteria and decisions were made prior to data unblinding.
Cell-attached experiments
Action potentials were detected in cell-attached mode by cross-correlating data to a template wave-
form. Template waveforms were composite action potentials recorded in cell-attached mode from
single neurons that were positively identified as the corresponding cell type in a subsequent whole
cell current clamp recording. The dot product representing a perfect fit was obtained by cross-corre-
lating the template peak to itself. If the dot product of the data and the template peak was equal or
greater than 25% of this perfect fit, then an action potential was called by a peak detection algo-
rithm (Mathworks, Inc.). Stimulus artifacts and rare spontaneous action potentials were excluded by
only analyzing data from 1 to 100 ms (FSIs) or 1–600 ms (SPNs) after stimulus delivery. Due to the
sharp FSI cell-attached waveform, electrical noise was matched to the FSI template peak in some
recordings. To exclude these false calls, two additional exclusion criteria were added: action poten-
tials were excluded (1) if their amplitudes were less than 10 standard deviations of the recording
minus the stimulus artifact, i.e. electrical noise and (2) if their cross-correlation peak amplitudes were
less than 25% of the maximum peak in a given sweep.
Current-clamp experiments
Action potentials were detected by running a peak detection algorithm (Mathworks Inc.) on voltage
velocity data with a peak threshold of 1 � 104 V/s and a minimum peak distance of 2 ms. Action
potential onset and offset were defined at the intersections of the waveform with a sliding mean
baseline voltage that constituted 10% of the length of the current injection. Action potential and
after-hyperpolarization properties were measured up to the point when increasing current injection
attenuated firing rate. Action potential half-width was defined as half the time between onset and
peak voltage. Action potential amplitude was defined as the voltage difference between the sliding
baseline and peak amplitude. AHP potential onset and offset were defined as the next two intersec-
tions with the sliding baseline after the action potential peak voltage. AHP amplitude was defined as
the negative-most voltage between onset and offset and the AHP waveform was integrated over
the sliding baseline for total voltage. AHP voltage measurements were converted to current using
input resistance. Firing rates were measured in response to a series of increasing 500 ms current
step amplitudes ranging from �0.4 to 2.0 nA in 200 pA intervals. Maximum response duration was

 defined as the longest period of sustained firing observed during this series of current injections.
Rheobase was determined by identifying the 200 pA interval in which the first action potential was
fired and subsequently interrogating this interval with 500 ms current injections at 10 pA resolution.
Subthreshold test pulses were used to determine passive membrane properties. Input resistance
was calculated as RI = dV/I. Whole cell capacitance was calculated by integrating the decay phase

Cwhole cell. Cells with Rs >30 megaOhms were excluded from analysis.
Voltage clamp experiments
Voltage clamp experiments assessing habit-related FSI physiology were carried out in the presence
of picrotoxin (50 mM). Paired pulse ratio was calculated as log2(EPSC2/EPSC1) for first and second
EPSC amplitudes. Paired stimuli were delivered 50 ms apart. Spontaneous EPSCs were recorded at
Vm = �70 mV at 5X gain for 5 min per cell. Automated event detection was performed using MiniA-
nalysis (Synaptosoft). To validate the use of PV-Arch, 532 nm light-induced currents were recorded
in FSI and SPNs in the presence of gabazine (10 mM), AP5 (50 mM), and NBQX (50 mM) to block
GABAA, NMDA, and AMPA receptors, respectively.
In vivo single-unit recordings
Single unit activity was sorted into frequency bins by converting interspike intervals to instantaneous
firing rates. Frequency bands were defined as D = 0–4 Hz, q = 4–8 Hz, a = 8–13 Hz, b = 13–30 Hz,
and g = 30–100 Hz. The fraction of ISIs falling in a particular frequency band was calculated relative
to the total number of ISIs. To compare frequency band distributions of single unit records to rate-
matched Poisson processes, for each single unit with N ISIs, N points were randomly drawn from a
Poisson distribution with l set to the mean ISI (1/mean firing rate) for the corresponding single unit.
This simulation was run 20 times per single unit. All 20 simulations were binned according to the
described frequency band bounds and normalized counts were averaged across simulations. Since
each simulated unit corresponded to a real recording with mean firing rate = 1/l, observed and sim-
ulated data were compared via multiple paired t-tests and Bonferroni-Sidak correction for multiple
comparisons. For behavioral analysis, 3D tracking data were transformed into Cartesian coordinates
(x, y and z) by the Cortex software (MotionAnalysis Corp.) to allow distance calculations.
2PLSM calcium imaging
Raw frames were corrected using a drift correction algorithm (Li et al., 2008) to control for minor
fluctuations in X and Y. Baseline fluorescence was measured over a 2 s sliding window to calculate
change in fluorescence over baseline (DF/F0). Action potentials were detected using a cross-correla-
tion approach as described for current clamp and cell-attached recordings above. The template
peak was generated by simultaneous calcium imaging and cell-attached electrophysiological experi-
ments and represented a single action potential (O’Hare et al., 2016). Detected peaks possessed
dot-products at least 50% that of a perfect fit (cross-correlating template to itself). Although dSPN
and iSPN calcium transients are similar in these experimental conditions (O’Hare et al., 2016), sepa-
rate template peaks corresponding to the SPN subtype classification of each ROI were used.
Additional inclusion criteria beyond the cross-correlation threshold were used at the level of event
detection, ROI inclusion, and slice inclusion to maximize data quality and reliability. Detected events
were included as evoked responses only if they occurred within 375 ms of stimulation- any other
events were excluded from analysis. Additionally, a lockout window was set in the peak detection
algorithm to ensure that no event could occur within 1 s of the previously detected event. For an
ROI to be included, a noise threshold was empirically determined to avoid excessive false event
detection: the standard deviation of the DF/F0 signal could not equal or exceed 0.0575. Additionally,
ROIs were excluded if fluorescence was saturating, if they had drifted from the scan path such that
signal was no longer detected, if they did not respond at least once to a supra-threshold stimulus
(1.5 mA) delivered 10 times at the end of the experiment, and if the ratio of non-evoked to evoked
events detected at this suprathreshold stimulation intensity was greater than 4.5. These parameters
were tested against multiple data sets from simultaneous calcium imaging and cell-attached

 recording experiments as previously reported (O’Hare et al., 2016) and were found to create an
optimal balance of minimizing false detections and maximizing correct detections. Finally, slices
which displayed poor loading, likely due to poor slice health or experimenter error during bulk-load-
ing, were excluded from analysis. Each slice was required to have at least 12 SPNs of each subtype
that passed all other exclusion criteria. This criterion was determined by finding the N at which coef-
ficient of variation (CV) became a linear function of sample size, i.e. decreased only due to the CV
denominator and not undersampling.
To analyze a pre-post effect within cell, such as wash-in of IEM-1460, only ROIs which were pres-
ent and passed exclusion criteria both in pre and post recordings were included in analysis (See
Figure 1C for matching ROIs before and after). Thus, drug effect was calculated for each individual
cell using an internal baseline. Spike probability was calculated as the fraction of trials in which an
evoked response was detected. Amplitude of an evoked calcium transient was calculated as the
maximum DF/F0 in the transient waveform. Latency was calculated as the time between stimulus
delivery and the time at which the cross-correlation dot-product reached half that of the perfect fit,
i.e. the time of peak detection. When calculating dSPN/iSPN ratios, SEM was derived as:

. All analysis functions were custom-made in MATLAB unless otherwise
noted.
To classify SPNs as ‘high-firing’ or ‘low-firing’ prior to application of IEM-1460 (Figure 1D),
baseline calcium transient amplitudes for each SPN subtype were separated into two clusters
according to a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The effect of IEM-1460 was then calculated sepa-
rately for ‘high-firing’ and ‘low-firing’ SPNs of each subtype and significance was determined using
paired t-tests. In fitting the GMMs for dSPNs and iSPNs, the only user-specified input was the
number of clusters (k = 2).
Statistics
F statistics were calculated using repeated measures analysis of variance. For within-cell compari-
sons, t statistics were calculated by paired, two-sided t-tests. Otherwise, unpaired, two-sided t-tests
were used. For non-normal data sets, Mann-Whitney U tests were used. All r values were obtained
using Pearson correlation analyses. Normality was measured using the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test of
the data against a hypothetical normal cumulative distribution function. Unless otherwise indicated
(e.g. Figure 2C, right panel), N values denote number of replicates considered biologically distinct
for statistical measures (Blainey et al., 2014) (see Table 1 for further detail). Technical replicates
within a single biological sample were averaged to obtain a single value. For all statistical tests, con-
fidence interval was set to a = 0.05.
