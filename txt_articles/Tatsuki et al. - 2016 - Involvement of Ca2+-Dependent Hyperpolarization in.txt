SUMMARY
The detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the
regulation of sleep duration in mammals are still
elusive. To address this challenge, we constructed a
simple computational model, which recapitulates
the electrophysiological characteristics of the slow-
wave sleep and awake states. Comprehensive bifur-
cation analysis predicted that a Ca2+-dependent
hyperpolarization pathway may play a role in slow-
wave sleep and hence in the regulation of sleep dura-
tion. To experimentally validate the prediction, we
generate and analyze 21 KO mice. Here we found
that impaired Ca2+-dependent K+ channels (Kcnn2
and Kcnn3), voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (Cacna1g
and Cacna1h), or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent ki-
nases (Camk2a and Camk2b) decrease sleep dura-
tion, while impaired plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase
(Atp2b3) increases sleep duration. Pharmacological
intervention and whole-brain imaging validated that
impaired NMDA receptors reduce sleep duration
and directly increase the excitability of cells. Based
on these results, we propose a hypothesis that a
Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization pathway underlies
the regulation of sleep duration in mammals.
INTRODUCTION
The invention of the electroencephalogram (EEG) more than 85
years ago (Berger, 1929; Caton, 1875) enabled the global char-
acterization of the mammalian brain’s electrical behavior. During
sleep, an EEG mostly displays high-amplitude low-frequency
fluctuations (Walter, 1937), which are generated by synchronized
slow oscillations of the cortical neuron membrane potential; dur-
ing waking, an EEG exhibits low-amplitude high-frequency fluc-
tuations, which are generated by the irregular firings of cortical
neurons (Steriade and McCarley, 2005). These two states are
mutually exclusive in a normal brain, and their ratio is homeo-
statically regulated (Steriade and McCarley, 2005). For example,
sleep pressure (or the need for sleep) is high after sleep depriva-
tion and gradually decreases during sleep. Importantly, sleep
pressure can be measured as an EEG slow-wave activity, i.e.,
an EEG delta power (Borbe
´ ly et al., 1981; Nakazawa et al.,
1978; Webb and Agnew, 1971). However, the detailed molecular
mechanisms underlying mammalian sleep/wake cycles are still
elusive.
To elucidate the complex dynamics of sleep/wake cycles, a
number of computational models have been proposed. The
two-process model attempts to capture the relatively slow
and macroscopic dynamics of sleep by describing two regulato-
ry processes, S and C, which are respectively a sleep-depen-
dent homeostatic process and a sleep-independent circadian
process (Borbe
´ ly, 1982). Process S represents the sleep pres-
sure, which increases in proportion to the quantity and quality
of the preceding awake state and decreases in the subse-
quent sleep state; process C is sleep regulation by the circadian
clock, which has been molecularly identified in fly and mammals
by forward genetics (Borbe
´ ly, 2001; Lowrey and Takahashi,
2011). Although the two-process and similar models can explain
the slow and macroscopic dynamics of sleep/wake cycles, they
are too simple to predict the details underlying molecular mech-
anisms, particularly of the homeostatic process S, which remain
elusive.
Another series of computational models were derived to
explain the relatively fast and microscopic dynamics of experi-
mentally observed electrophysiological behavior. The high-
amplitude low-frequency oscillations are observed by EEG and
by intracellular and extracellular electrophysiological recording
during slow-wave sleep (SWS), which has two electro-physio-
logically different phases: the depolarized, bursting phase
and the hyperpolarized, silent phase (Steriade, 2003; Steriade
et al., 2001). Several computational models for these phases,
based on populations of interacting neurons, have been pro-
posed (Bazhenov et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2012; Compte
et al., 2003; Hill and Tononi, 2005; Sanchez-Vives et al., 2010;

These
‘‘neuron-network’’
models
elegantly recapitulate the behavior of cortical and thalamic neu-
rons. These studies indicate that the transition from bursting
to silent phase is facilitated by (1) the enhancement of Ca2+-
and Na+-dependent K+ channels in pyramidal neurons, (2) the
inhibition of the excitatory synaptic current between pyramidal
neurons, or (3) the enhancement of feedback repression among
pyramidal neurons and interneurons.
To date, however, genetic evidence for these mechanisms
has been lacking especially in mammals. Moreover, the simu-
lated slow-wave oscillation models are heavily dependent on
the given parameter values, and thus their predictive power is
limited. In part, this is because the neuron-network models
possess such a huge parameter space that the number and
type of parameter sets (and a common critical pathway) that
can generate slow-wave oscillations cannot be identified
comprehensively. A simple, but not simplistic, computational
model is required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of
sleep/wake cycles.
Various hypotheses have been proposed to connect fast/mi-
croscopic and slow/macroscopic dynamics, but they have not
been fully integrated into computational models. The ‘‘sleep-
inducing substance (SIS)’’ hypothesis (or ‘‘sleep-regulatory sub-
stance’’ hypothesis, in general) (Clinton et al., 2011; Krueger
et al., 2008; Obal and Krueger, 2003), in which SISs accumulate
during waking and gradually degrade during sleep, has existed
since 1909 (Ishimori, 1909). In the SIS hypothesis, process S is
intuitively represented as the concentration of SISs (Factor S).
Several candidate molecules for the SISs have been identified
including adenosine, nitric oxide, prostaglandin D, tumor-necro-
sis factor, interleukin 1, and growth-hormone-releasing hor-
mone. All of these molecules can induce sleep when injected
into animals. However, it remains difficult to explain fast electro-
physiological dynamics using the slow timescale observed for
the accumulating SISs. Therefore, it is important to identify the
molecular targets of SISs to understand the shift between slow
and fast dynamics.
Alternatively but not exclusively, the ‘‘synaptic homeostasis’’
hypothesis proposes that synaptic strength of cortical neurons
represent process S (Tononi and Cirelli, 2006). For example, dur-
ing waking, synaptic strength increases via learning processes
such as long-term potentiation, whereas during much of sleep,
synaptic strength decreases. Hence, the synaptic homeostasis
hypothesis attempts to connect the fast dynamics of the cortical
neurons’ membrane potential (slow-wave oscillations) with
the relatively slow dynamics for process S (synaptic strength).
Although some experimental results support the synaptic
homeostasis hypothesis (Vyazovskiy et al., 2008), others chal-
lenge it (Yang et al., 2014). In addition, computational neuron-
network models apparently contradict this hypothesis, because
the enhancement of excitatory synaptic current between pyrami-
dal neurons (i.e., increased synaptic strength) in the current
neuron-network models enhances the awake rather than the
sleep state, by depolarizing the pyramidal neurons. Hence,
we need a computational model that is compatible with the rela-
tively slow homeostatic dynamics (e.g., of process S) and the
relatively fast electrophysiological dynamics (e.g., slow-wave
oscillations).
RESULTS
The Computational Averaged-Neuron Model
Recapitulates Slow-Wave Sleep Firing Patterns
To reproduce the oscillating bursting and silent phases of
cortical neurons during slow-wave sleep, we simplified the
neuron-network models (Bazhenov et al., 2002; Chen et al.,
2012; Compte et al., 2003; Hill and Tononi, 2005; Sanchez-Vives
et al., 2010; Timofeev et al., 2000). We first performed mean-field
approximations of a population of neurons to construct an ‘‘aver-
aged-neuron’’ model (AN model) (Figure 1A; Table S1). We
assumed, as a first-order approximation, that the averaged
neuron could interact with itself (directly or indirectly) through
excitatory (Na+ currents mediated by AMPA receptors, IAMPA
and Ca2+ currents mediated by NMDA receptors, INMDA), or
inhibitory (Cl� currents mediated by GABAA receptors, IGABA)
synaptic currents. In addition to extrinsic currents, we incorpo-
rated, as intrinsic currents, depolarizing Na+ and Ca2+ currents
and hyperpolarizing K+ currents. The depolarizing Na+ and
Ca2+ currents are mediated by voltage-gated (INa) or the persis-
tent (INaP) Na+ channels and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (ICa),
respectively, whereas the K+ currents are mediated by several
types of K+ channels, including voltage-gated (IK), leak (IL), fast
A-type (IA), inwardly rectifying (IAR), slowly inactivating (IKS), and
Ca2+ dependent (IKCa). We also assumed that Ca2+ pumps/
exchangers turn over Ca2+ with the time constant, tCa. Notably,
the AN model recapitulated the SWS firing patterns, with its alter-
nating bursting and silent phases (Figure 1B). Moreover, the
parameter values in the AN model that generated slow-wave
oscillations were similar to those in neuron-network models,
implying that sufficient information to generate SWS was pre-
served in this simple model.
Close inspection showed that the SWS firing patterns in the
AN model were characterized by a bursting phase, in which
Ca2+ enters the cell mainly through the NMDA receptor (NMDAR)
and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (Cav channels), followed by a
silent phase, in which accumulated Ca2+ evokes Ca2+-depen-
dent K+ channels (KCa channels) (Figure 1B; Figure S1A). It
then exits the cell through Ca2+ pumps/exchangers with tCa (Fig-
ure 1A). To investigate the role of this Ca2+-dependent hyperpo-
larization pathway in the SWS firing patterns, we performed a

 bifurcation analysis (i.e., a gradual change in parameter values)
of the conductance of each intrinsic and extrinsic current and
of the Ca2+ efflux rate. As expected, we found that downregulat-
ing the conductance of the NMDAR (gNMDA), Cav channels (gCa),
KCa channels (gKCa), and/or reducing the time constant (tCa) of
Ca2+ efflux mediated by Ca2+ pumps/exchangers caused the
transition from SWS to awake firing patterns (Figure 1C; Figures
S1B–S1G), implying that this Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization
pathway may have a pivotal role in regulating the SWS firing
patterns.
The Averaged-Neuron Model Predicts that a Ca2+-
Dependent Hyperpolarization Pathway May Play a Role
in Slow-Wave Sleep and hence in the Regulation of Sleep
Duration
To investigate the generality of these findings, we sought to iden-
tify a broad variety of parameter sets that could generate SWS
firing patterns (Figure 1D). We comprehensively searched for
the conductance of the intrinsic (0.01–100 mS/cm2) and extrinsic
(0.002–20 mS) currents and the time constant for Ca2+ efflux (10–
1,000 ms) that resulted in this pattern. In this search, we gener-
ated more than 10,000,000 random parameter sets from expo-
nential distributions. From these, we identified 1,113 parameter
sets that generated SWS firing patterns. The success rate was
�5.7 3 10�3%. These patterns exhibited intracellular Ca2+ waves
that were coupled with the membrane potential (Figure 1E).
If a particular molecular mechanism is targeted by the homeo-
static process S, it should control, directly or indirectly, the
transitions between the SWS and awake state, because the
accumulation of factor S (or the increase of its quality) presum-
ably facilitates the transition from the awake state to SWS, while
its degradation (or the decrease of its quality) enhances the tran-
sition from SWS to the awake state. To identify potential targets
for factor S, we performed a comprehensive bifurcation analysis
of the 1,113 SWS parameter sets and searched for channel
conductance or the time constant that could contribute to the
transition from SWS to awake firing patterns. In this analysis,
each channel conductance or the time constant was gradually
changed within the range from 10�3 to 10 times its value in
the original parameter set (Figure 1F). Indeed, downregulation
of the Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization pathway led to the
transition from slow-wave-sleep to awake firing patterns in 848
(76.2%), 581 (52.2%), and 861 (77.4%) cases with altered
gKCa, gNMDA, and tCa, respectively (Figure 1G). These results
were consistent with the suggested relationship between
cortical delta waves and KCa conductance (Steriade et al.,
1990) and also predicted that an impairment of KCa channels
or NMDARs, or an enhancement of Ca2+ pumps/exchangers
would facilitate the transition from SWS to awake firing patterns
and hence decrease the sleep duration (i.e., impairment of Ca2+-
pump/exchanger would increase the sleep duration).
To verify the role of the Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization
pathway in SWS, we conducted the parameter searches under
the condition of knocked out (KO) KCa channels (gKCa = 0) or
NMDARs (gNMDA = 0). The success rate of the KCa channel KO
parameter search was severely decreased (�1.1 3 10�5%)
compared to the wild-type (WT) parameter search, suggesting
that KCa channels are important for generating SWS firing pat-
terns, whereas the success rate of the NMDAR KO parameter
search was not dramatically reduced (Figure S1L). Since the
intracellular Ca2+ oscillated together with the membrane poten-
tial of SWS firing patterns in the NMDAR KO search (Figure S1H),
we speculated that there might be an alternative Ca2+ entry
mechanism. Indeed, bifurcation analysis revealed that changes
in gCa led to the transition more often (836 cases, 71.1%, Fig-
ure 1H) in the NMDAR KO search than in the WT parameter
search (108 cases, 9.7%, Figure 1G).
Therefore, we next conducted the parameter search under the
double KO of Cav channels (gCa = 0) and NMDARs (gNMDA = 0) to
confirm the redundant role of these Ca2+ entry mechanisms. In
fact, the success rate of the parameter search was severely
decreased (�9.2 3 10�5%) compared to the WT parameter
search (Figure S1L). We also noted that the success rate was
not reduced under the Cav channel single KO search (Figure S1L)
and that these SWS firing patterns were also accompanied by
intracellular Ca2+ waves (Figure S1I). As expected, we found
that the downregulation of NMDARs (gNMDA) under the Cav chan-
nel KO condition more often (895 cases, 88.5%, Figure 1I) led to
the transition than in the WT parameter search (581 cases,
52.2%, Figure 1G). Overall, these results suggested that Cav
channels and NMDARs have redundant roles in Ca2+ entry to
generate SWS firing patterns and hence that the Ca2+-depen-
dent hyperpolarization pathway is involved in SWS. We also
found that there were no marked changes in the success rate
(�7.6 3 10�3%) or bifurcation analysis when we imposed the
KO of GABAA receptors on the random parameter search (Fig-
ures S1J and S1K). This result is consistent with a previous
report, in which the hyperpolarization during SWS is not medi-
ated by GABAergic inhibition (Steriade et al., 2001). From these
bifurcation analyses, we predicted that impairment of ion chan-
nels related to the Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization pathway
might decrease the sleep duration by having the cortex tend to
generate awake firing patterns than SWS firing patterns. On
the other hand, we predicted the impairment of Ca2+-pump/
exchanger would increase the sleep duration by facilitating the
Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization pathway.
Impairment of Ca2+-Dependent K+ Channels Decreases
Sleep Duration
To validate the AN model, we first tested the prediction that
downregulation of KCa channels would decrease the sleep
duration. In the mouse genomes, eight genes (KCa1.1 [Kcnma1],
KCa2.1 [Kcnn1], KCa2.2 [Kcnn2], KCa2.3 [Kcnn3], KCa3.1 [Kcnn4],
KCa4.1 [Kcnt1], KCa4.2 [Kcnt2], and KCa5.1 [Kcnu1]) are catego-
rized into the KCa channel family according to their sequence
similarity (Wei et al., 2005).
To knock out all of the KCa channel family members, we used
the ‘‘triple-target CRISPR’’ method (Sunagawa et al., 2016)
(Figures S2A–S2H; Table S2). We also used highly accurate
sleep/wake recording system called the Snappy Sleep Stager
(SSS) (Sunagawa et al., 2016). We noted that there was no signif-
icant influence on sleep phenotype of the triple-target CRISPR
itself by creating Tyrosinase (Tyr) KO mice (Sunagawa et al.,
2016). Sleep/wake phenotyping was performed for animals
with KO genotype, which was confirmed by qPCR and/
or genomic sequencing (Figure S3; Tables S3 and S4). As

 predicted, Kcnn2, Kcnn3, Kcnn4, Kcnt1, and Kcnu1 KO mice ex-
hibited significantly decreased sleep duration (Figures 2A and
2C). The Kcnn2 KO mice caused the largest decrease in sleep
duration, i.e., the strongest short-sleeper phenotype, 606.3 ±
14.7 min (mean ± SEM, n = 5), which was 129.3 min (�2.6 SD)
shorter than that of WT mice (p < 0.001). Kcnn3 KO mice also ex-
hibited a strong short-sleeper phenotype, 629.1 ± 11.8 min
(mean ± SEM, n = 6), which was 106.6 min (�2.1 SD) shorter
than that of WT mice (p < 0.001). In fact, the Kcnn2 and Kcnn3
KO mice exhibited shorter sleep durations than WT mice over
most times of the day (Figure 2B). Both of these mutants dis-
played lower Pws (the transition probability that an awake state
will switch to a sleep one) but a normal Psw (the transition prob-
ability that a sleep state will switch to an awake one) compared
with WT mice (Figure 2C), indicating that their short-sleeper
phenotype was caused by an increase in awake-state stabiliza-
tion (i.e., longer episode durations of an awake state) but not
by a decrease in sleep-state stabilization. We note that Kcnn2
KO mice were previously reported to have a (not-significant)
tendency of decrease in sleep duration (Cueni et al., 2008). Our
non-invasive sleep phenotyping clearly revealed the significant
short-sleeper phenotype in Kcnn2 KO mice. As further valida-
tion, we generated another group of Kcnn2 and Kcnn3 KO
mice by an independent CRISPR/Cas9 probe set (set 2, Figures
S2J and S2K; Table S2) and confirmed the observed short-
sleeper phenotypes (Figures 2D–2F). These results strongly sug-
gested that the observed short-sleeper phenotype of Kcnn2 and
Kcnn3 KO mice cannot be attributed to the possible off-target
effect of CRISPR, but rather to the common genomic defects
in Kcnn2 and Kcnn3 gene, respectively.
To exclude the possibility that a gene KO might affect the
respiration phenotype and hence that SSS system could miscal-
culate their sleep duration, we conducted the basal EEG/EMG
recording of Kcnn2 KO mice. As a result, the observed short-
sleep phenotype of Kcnn2 KO mice was also confirmed by the
basal EEG/EMG recording, where Kcnn2 KO mice exhibited
the significant decrease of NREM sleep (SWS) duration in addi-
tion to the significant decrease of total sleep duration (Figures
2G, 2H, and S2L). To further validate the role of Kcnn2 gene in
the regulation of sleep duration, we conducted a sleep depriva-
tion (SD) experiment to Kcnn2 KO mice and WT mice (Figure 2I).
We compared NREM sleep (SWS) duration between the basal
recording and the recovery period after 8 hr SD for Kcnn2 KO
mice and WT mice, respectively. The WT mice exhibited a signif-
icant change in NREM sleep (SWS) duration (ZT12–ZT24)
between the basal recording and the recovery period after 8 hr
SD (ZT4–ZT12) (p < 0.01, Figure 2I). On the other hand, Kcnn2
KO mice exhibited no significant change in NREM sleep (SWS)
duration (Figure 2I), indicating a change in the regulation of sleep
duration in Kcnn2 KO mice. These results further support the hy-
pothesis that the Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization mechanism
underlies the regulation of sleep duration in mammals.
We also noted that Kcnma1 exhibited decreased sleep dura-
tion during morning and increased sleep duration during night
(Figure S2I), which is consistent with the previously reported
circadian phenotype of the KO animal for this gene (Meredith
et al., 2006), further validating our methods for producing and
phenotyping KO mice. Taken together, these results validated
the first prediction of the AN model that an impairment of KCa
channels would decrease sleep duration.
Impairment of Voltage-Gated Ca2+ Channels Decreases
Sleep Duration
To further validate the AN model, we next tested the second pre-
diction that the downregulation of Cav channels would decrease
the sleep duration. The Cav channels are Ca2+ channels that open
in response to membrane depolarization resulting in Ca2+ influx.
They are usually composed of four or five distinct subunits (a1, a2,
b, g, and d). Among them, the a1 subunit mainly determines the
channels’ responsiveness and behavior in response to mem-
brane depolarization. At least ten a1 subunits are found in mam-
mals, and they are divided into three well-defined and closely
related groups by their sequence similarity (Catterall et al., 2005).
We created KOs of all of the ten Cav channel a1 subunits
(Cav1.1 [Cacna1s], Cav1.2 [Cacna1c], Cav1.3 [Cacna1d], CaV1.4
[Cacna1f],
Cav2.1
[Cacna1a],
Cav2.2
[Cacna1b],
CaV2.3
[Cacna1e], CaV3.1 [Cacna1g], CaV3.2 [Cacna1h], and CaV3.3
[Cacna1i]) by injecting three gRNAs for each gene (Figures
S4A–S4J and S4M–S4R; Tables S2 and S3). We confirmed the
lethal phenotype seen in Cacna1s, Cacna1c, and Cacna1a bial-
lelic KO mice generated by conventional methods (Austin et al.,
2004; Jun et al., 1999; Seisenberger et al., 2000) also occurred in
KO mice generated by the triple-target CRISPR method. We also
observed the lethal phenotype in Cacna1d KO mice generated
by the triple-target CRISPR method, which targeted all known
isoforms of Cacna1d, including two isoforms that were not tar-
geted in viable Cacna1d KO mice generated by conventional
methods (Namkung et al., 2001; Platzer et al., 2000). As pre-
dicted from the AN model, Cacna1g, Cacna1h, and Cacna1f
KO mice exhibited significant decrease in sleep duration (Fig-
ures 3A–3C). In particular, Cacna1g and Cacna1h KO mice
showed strong short-sleeper phenotypes, with sleep duration
of 655.1 ± 13.4 min (mean ± SEM, n = 10) and 647.6 ±
20.1 min (mean ± SEM, n = 5), respectively, which were
80.5 min (1.59 SD, p < 0.001) and 88.1 min (1.73 SD, p <
0.001) shorter than that of WT (Figure 3C). As further validation,
we generated another group of Cacna1g and Cacna1h KO
mice by independent CRISPR/Cas9 probe sets (set 2) and
confirmed the observed short-sleeper phenotypes (Figures
3D–3F; Figures S4K, S4L, and S4S–S4U; Tables S2 and S3).
These results strongly suggested that the short-sleeper pheno-
type of Cacna1g KO and Cacna1h KO mice cannot be attributed
to the possible off-target effect of CRISPR but rather to the com-
mon genomic defects in Cacna1g and Cacna1h genes, respec-
tively. The short-sleeper phenotype of Cacna1g KO mice in this
study was consistent with the previous reports (Anderson
et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2004). No significant change in sleep dura-
tion of Cacna1b KO mice was also consistent with the previous
report (Beuckmann et al., 2003). Taken together, these results
confirmed the second prediction that an impairment of Cav
channels would decrease sleep duration.

 duration. In the mouse genome, seven different subunits are cate-
gorized into the NMDAR family based on their sequence similarity.
These NMDAR subunits form three well-defined and closely
related subfamilies: the GluN1 (Nr1) subunit, four distinct GluN2
subunits, GluN2A (Nr2a), GluN2B (Nr2b), GluN2C (Nr2c), and
GluN2D (Nr2d), and two GluN3 subunits, GluN3A (Nr3a) and
GluN3B (Nr3b). NMDARs function as a heterotetramer in which
Nr1 subunits typically assemble with Nr2 subunits or a mixture
of Nr2 and Nr3 subunits (Cull-Candy and Leszkiewicz, 2004; Pao-
letti, 2011; Traynelis et al., 2010). In contrast to the KCa channel
family, KO mice of either Nr1 or Nr2b, which are two main subunits
of NMDAR family, exhibit lethal phenotype (Forrest et al., 1994;
Li et al., 1994; Sunagawa et al., 2016). Therefore, we inhibited
the NMDARs pharmacologically. First, the intraperitoneal (i.p.)

 injection of phencyclidine (PCP), a well-known antagonist of
NMDARs, into WT mice resulted in significantly decreased sleep
duration as predicted (Figures 4A and 4B). We also confirmed
this decreased sleep duration by a more specific NMDAR antag-
onist, MK-801 (Figures 4C and 4D) (Koek et al., 1988). The
observed short-sleep phenotype was also confirmed by EEG/
EMG recording, where the MK-801-treated mice exhibited the
significant decrease of NREM sleep (SWS) duration in addition
to a significant decrease of total sleep duration (Figures 4E and
4F). We also note that this short-sleep phenotype was observed
in the other strain of mice, C57BL/6J (Figures S5A–S5D). In addi-
tion, we chronically administered MK-801 to C57BL/6J mice (the
drug was diluted into sterile water to be 16, 32, 64, and 96 mg/L
and administered as drinking water) and confirmed the decreased
sleep-duration phenotype (Figures S5E–S5G). Taken together,
these results confirmed our prediction that impaired NMDAR
function would decrease sleep duration.

would increase the excitability of cortical
neurons, especially glutamatergic pyra-
midal
neurons
that
we
modeled
in
this study. This prediction
is some-
what counter-intuitive, because NMDARs
mediate ‘‘excitatory’’ positive-ion cur-
rents
from
outside
to
the inside
of
neurons, but it makes sense, given that
the
Ca2+-dependent
hyperpolarization
pathway is initiated by Ca2+ entry through
NMDARs. To test this prediction, we per-
formed a whole-brain imaging of neural
activity at single-cell resolution using
CUBIC analysis (Susaki et al., 2014) and
Arc-dVenus mice, in which a destabilized
version of yellow fluorescence protein Venus is expressed upon
neural excitation, under control of Arc gene promoter. To mini-
mize temporal variations, we sampled Arc-dVenus mice every
6 hr for 1 day under constant darkness, with or without the
chronic administration of NMDAR antagonist, MK-801. We
noticed a temporal variation of Venus signals in the Arc-dVenus
mice without drug administration (Figure S6A; Movie S1). Venus
signals were relatively low during the subjective day (circadian
time [CT] 4 and 10), when mice are relatively inactive, and were
relatively high during the subjective night (CT16 and CT22), a
higher activity time for mice (Figure S6B). In contrast, in the
MK-801-treated Arc-dVenus mice, the Venus signals exhibited
different temporal patterns (Figure S6A; Movie S2). Importantly,
these altered Venus expression patterns matched the altered
behavioral patterns of the MK-801-treated mice (Figure S6B).
Notably, close inspection of whole-brain single-cell resolution
imaging data revealed that some cells were highly activated
with high-intensity Venus signals both in MK-801-treated and
untreated mice (Figure S6C). Importantly, the MK-801-treated
mice exhibited significantly more hyper-activated cells than the
untreated mice did (Figure 5A). We also noticed that the total
number of hyper-activated cells was well correlated with the total

 intensity of hyper-activated cells (Figure S6D), which allowed us
to perform the simplified computational analysis and obtained
spatio-temporal profiling of cellular activities for different regions
over the entire brain (Figure 5A). Subsequent hierarchical clus-
tering analysis (Figure 5B; Table S6) revealed that individual brain
regions follow a few common patterns of cellular activities (Fig-
ures 5C–5E; Figure S6E; Movie S3). For example, brain regions
in the pink cluster such as various regions of cerebral cortex
exhibit higher intensity in subjective day (CT4 or CT10) in the
MK-801-treated mice, whereas they exhibit comparable inten-
sity in subjective night (CT16 or CT22) (Figures 5C and 5F). Brain
regions in the yellow cluster such as cerebellar cortex exhibit
much higher intensity in early subjective day (CT4) in the MK-
801-treated mice, whereas they exhibit comparable intensity in

0.05) and strongest (�400 hyper-activated cells/mm3) response
to the MK-801 injection (Figures 6C and 6D, right). To determine
the cellular identify of hyper-activated cells in the layer 4-6 of the
MK-801-treated mice, we conducted fluorescence in situ hybrid-
ization (FISH) analysis of WT mice intraperitoneally injected with
or without MK-801 and performed double-staining of c-Fos and
Nr2b (Figures S6F and S6G; Figures 6E and 6F; Table S5),
Vglut1/2 (glutamatergic cell makers, Figure S6H; Figures 6H
and 6J; Table S5), or Gad1/2 (GABAergic cell makers, Figure S6I;
Figures 6I and 6J; Table S5), respectively. As a result, we found

 that MK-801-treated mice exhibited significantly more c-Fos-ex-
pressing cells in the layer 4-6 than the untreated mice did (Fig-
ures 6E–6G, p < 0.05). Importantly, almost all c-Fos-expressing
cells in the layer 4-6 also expressed Nr2b mRNA (Figure 6G, p <
0.05), strongly suggesting that pharmacological inhibition of
NR2B-containing NMDARs increased not indirectly but rather
directly the excitability of the neuron. The Ca2+-dependent
hyperpolarization hypothesis predicts that the inhibition of
Ca2+ entry will induce the excitability of both glutamatergic and
GABAergic neurons through the inhibition of Ca2+-dependent
hyperpolarization pathway. Indeed, both numbers of glutamater-
gic and GABAergic neurons that express c-Fos were increased
in MK-801-treated mice compared to untreated mice (Figures
6G and 6J), which was consistent with the direct excitation of
these neurons by inhibiting NMDARs. We also note that most
of the c-Fos-expressing cells in the layer 4-6 were glutamatergic
cells (Figures 6H–6J). Taken together, these results confirmed
the fourth prediction that impaired NMDAR functioning directly
increases the excitability of neurons, especially glutamatergic
pyramidal neurons that are modeled in this study.
Impairment of Plasma Membrane Ca2+ ATPase
Increases Sleep Duration
To further validate the AN model, we next tested the last predic-
tion that downregulation of Ca2+ pump would increase the sleep
duration. The plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPases (PMCAs), a ma-
jor member of Ca2+ pump, are transport proteins located in the
plasma membrane of cells. PMCAs, whose function is powered
by hydrolysis of ATP, pump Ca2+ out of cells.
We created KOs of all of the four PMCAs (PMCA1 [Atp2b1],
PMCA2 [Atp2b2], PMCA3 [Atp2b3], and PMCA4 [Atp2b4]) by in-
jecting three gRNAs for each gene (Figures S7A–S7D, S7J, S7K,
and S7N; Tables S2 and S3). We confirmed the lethal phenotype
seen in Atp2b1 biallelic KO mice generated by conventional
methods (Okunade et al., 2004) also occurred in KO mice gener-
ated by the triple-target CRISPR method. As predicted from the
AN model, Atp2b3 KO mice exhibited a significant increase in
sleep duration with 777.8 ± 8.5 min (mean ± SEM, n = 12) in one
day, which was 53.6 min (1.07 SD, p < 0.05) longer than that of
WT mice (Figures 7A–7C). To confirm the significance of the
observed long-sleeper phenotype, we generated another batch
of Atp2b3 KO mice by the same CRISPR/Cas9 probe set (set
1 in UT, Figure S7L) and confirmed the reproducibility of the
observed long-sleeper phenotype (p < 0.01, Figures 7D–7F). As
further validation, we generated another group of Atp2b3 KO
mice by independent CRISPR/Cas9 probe set (set 2, Figures S7I
and S7M) and confirmed the significant long-sleeper phenotypes
(p < 0.01, Figures 7D–7F; Tables S2 and S3).These results strongly
suggested that the observed long-sleeper phenotype of Atp2b3
KO mice cannot be attributed to the possible off-target effect of
CRISPR, but rather to the common genomic defects in Atp2b3
gene. Taken together, these results confirmed the last prediction
that an impairment of Ca2+ pumps would increase sleep duration.
Impairment of Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein
Kinase Decreases Sleep Duration
In this study, our average-neuron model and its experimental
validation suggested that the molecular components in the
Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization pathway can be potential
molecular targets of homeostatic process S. In other words,
our model supposed that the underlying molecular mechanism
for homeostatic process S should target on the Ca2+-dependent
hyperpolarization pathway. Such molecular mechanism is also
supposed to be able to sense the awake and/or slow-wave-
sleep states (e.g., through the concentration or temporal pat-
terns of Ca2+) to allow the reversible transitions between SWS
and awake states. Although there are many intracellular mole-
cules meeting these criteria for the underlying molecular mecha-
nisms for homeostatic process S, we focused, as a first step, on
the major protein kinase in the brain, calcium/calmodulin-depen-
dent protein kinase type II (CaMKII), which is known to be able to
interact with some of the Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization
pathway (i.e., CaMKII is also a well-known protein family, which
can bind to NMDARs or L-type Ca2+ channels in response to
Ca2+ influx) (Leonard et al., 1999; Rose et al., 2009). CaMKII is
formed by 12 catalytically active subunits consisted of four
different subunits (CaMKIIa [Camk2a], CaMKIIb [Camk2b],
CaMKIIg [Camk2g], and CaMKIId [Camk2d]) and their kinase ac-
tivities are Ca2+ dependent. We thus created KOs of all of the four
CaMKIIs by injecting three gRNAs for each gene (Figures S7E–
S7H, S7P, S7Q, S7S, S7U, and S7V; Tables S2 and S3). Camk2a
KO and Camk2b KO mice exhibited a significant decrease in
sleep duration with 648.8 ± 29.5 min (mean ± SEM, n = 6) and
578.6 ± 14.7 min (mean ± SEM, n = 5) in 1 day, respectively,
which was 50.1 min (1.27 SD, p < 0.01) and 120.3 min (3.04
SD, p < 0.001) shorter than that of WT mice (Figures 7G–7I). As
further validation, we generated another group of Camk2a KO
mice and Camk2b KO mice by an independent CRISPR/Cas9
probe set (set 2, Figures S7O, S7R, and S7T; Tables S2 and
S3) and confirmed the observed short-sleeper phenotypes (Fig-
ures 7J–7L). These results strongly suggested that the observed
short-sleeper phenotype of Camk2a KO and Camk2b KO mice
cannot be attributed to the possible off-target effect of CRISPR,
but rather to the common genomic defects in Camk2a and
Camk2b gene, respectively. Taken together, these results further
support a hypothesis that Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization
pathway underlies the regulation of sleep duration in mammals.
DISCUSSION
Ca2+-Dependent Hyperpolarization Pathway as a
Possible Molecular Target for Process S
In this study, we developed the AN model, which revealed that the
molecular components of the Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization
pathway are potential molecular targets of the homeostatic sleep
regulators (Figure 7M). This model suggests that assembled neu-
rons themselves could have at least two default states, SWS and
awake. It is consistent with the previous in vitro cortical model
that showed transition from sleep-like state to wake-like state
by stimulation with mixture of neurotransmitters (Hinard et al.,
2012). In particular, the Ca2+-dependent mechanism of SWS
firing patterns is consistent with the previous computational
studies in electric bursting of various types of cells (Arbib, 2003;
Izhikevich, 2007). How the molecules, such as KCa channels
Kcnn2 and Kcnn3, the Cav channels Cacna1g and Cacna1h,
and MK-801-targeted NMDAR subunits (possibly Nr1/Nr2b)

 and the Ca2+ pumps Atp2b3 are targeted by the sleep homeo-
static process S remains to be solved. One possibility is that pro-
cess S may be represented as the amount of SISs, which then
regulate these molecules. In this context, it will be interesting to
examine the relationship of SISs (e.g., adenosine, NO, prosta-
glandin D, TNF, IL1, and GHRH) (Clinton et al., 2011; Krueger
et al., 2008; Obal and Krueger, 2003) to the molecules involved
in the Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization pathway. Alternatively,
but not exclusively, process S may be represented directly as the
quality or quantity of the molecules involved in the Ca2+-depen-
dent hyperpolarization pathway. In that case, process S can be
identified as an activity-dependent effect (e.g., phosphorylation)
and/or a mechanism affecting the quantity (e.g., translation) of
these target molecules. Given the increasing evidence for the
post-translational modification of KCa channels, Cav channels,
NMDARs, and Ca2+ pumps, one of the plausible execution mech-
anisms of homeostatic process S might be activity-dependent
protein modifications (e.g., phosphorylation or dephosphoryla-
tion) of the Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization pathway. The evi-
dence that impairment of Camk2a and Camk2b, a well-known
bounder and modifier of Cav channels and NMDARs, decreased
sleep duration may support this mechanism. Interestingly, since
protein modifications are often involved in sleep-related neuro-
logical processes that occur over long timescales (e.g., hours
to days), such as learning, memory, and circadian clocks, a role
for such activity-dependent protein modifications in the Ca2+-
dependent hyperpolarization pathway is compatible with the
slow and macroscopic dynamics of sleep. Compared to the ho-
meostatic (i.e., feedback) control expected for process S, circa-
dian (i.e., feedforward) control of the quality and/or quantity of the
molecules involved in the Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization
pathway might be also important especially for process C of
sleep (Borbe
´ ly, 1982). Recently, a dopamine synthesis pathway
was reported to be regulated by circadian clock in mammals
(Chung et al., 2014). In this context, it will be interesting to
examine the relationship of awake-inducing substances (e.g.,
dopamine) to the molecules involved in the Ca2+-dependent hy-
perpolarization pathway. We also noted previous reports that
process C (circadian clock) is regulated by calcium-dependent
pathways such as rhyanodine receptors, calcium-dependent po-
tassium channels, voltage-gated calcium channels, and calcium
binding proteins (Ding et al., 1998; Ikeda et al., 2003; Meredith
et al., 2006; Schmutz et al., 2014; Stadler et al., 2010). In either
case, gradual changes in the quality and/or quantity of such
target molecules in the Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization
pathway, at least in theory, could eventually alter the fast/micro-
scopic electrophysiological patterns of neurons, suggesting that
this mechanism is also compatible both with slow/macroscopic
homeostatic regulations and fast/microscopic electro-physi-
ology. Therefore, the Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization hy-
pothesis has the potential to connect the gaps between slow/
macroscopic homeostatic regulations and fast/microscopic
electrophysiological dynamics.
A Possible Role of Ca2+-Dependent Hyperpolarization
Pathway in Slow-Wave Sleep and Sleep Homeostasis
In this study, we performed mammalian reverse genetics without
crossing by combining the recently developed triple-target
CRISPR method and the non-invasive sleep/wake recording sys-
tem SSS, which allowed us to comprehensively generate more
than 21 KO mice and efficiently analyze their sleep/wake pheno-
type. As a result, seven KO mice, including Kcnn2, Kcnn3,
Cacna1g, Cacna1h, Atp2b3, Camk2a, and Camk2b KO mice,
exhibited the significant change in sleep duration. These sleep/
wake phenotypes were confirmed by another group of corre-
sponding KO mice by independent CRISPR/Cas9 probe set (set
2). We also noted that pharmacological inhibition of NMDARs by
MK-801 reduced sleep duration. Although there is the possibility
that these gene knockouts might affect the phenotype of respira-
tion and SSS system could miscalculate their sleep duration, the
EEG/EMG recording of Kcnn2 KO mice and MK-801-treated
mice confirmed these mice exhibited the significant decrease of
NREM sleep (SWS) duration in addition to the significant decrease
of total sleep duration. These results supported the role of Ca2+-
dependent hyperpolarization pathway in the regulation of sleep
duration. In addition, these EEG/EMG results also suggest that
the observed decrease of sleep duration was mainly due to the
decrease of NREM sleep (SWS) duration at least in Kcnn2 KO
mice and MK-801-treated mice. Further EEG/EMG recording of
the remaining six KO mice will clarify the relationship between
Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization pathway and SWS.
Another interesting question is about the relationship between
Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization pathway and sleep homeo-
stasis. As the very first step, we conducted an SD experiment
to Kcnn2 KO mice and WT mice, which revealed that WT mice ex-
hibited significant change in NREM sleep (SWS) duration after
SD. On the other hand, Kcnn2 KO mice exhibited no significant
change in NREM sleep (SWS) duration, implying a possible role
of Kcnn2 in sleep homeostasis. Further experimental validations
(e.g., the SD experiments of the remaining six KO mice and MK-
801-treated mice) will also clarify the relationship between Ca2+-
dependent hyperpolarization pathway and sleep homeostasis.
A Systems Biology Approach to Examine Sleep/Wake
Cycles
Although the molecular identity of the sleep homeostatic pro-
cess S is still unknown, our findings predict that process S
can be implemented as a neural-activity-dependent quality

 and/or quantity control of the Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization
pathway. Therefore, the potential molecular targets for pro-
cess S (e.g., Kcnn2, Kcnn3, Cacna1g, Cacna1h, Nr1/Nr2b, and
Atp2b3) can be used to identify the missing switch (i.e., pro-
cess S) between sleep/wake cycles. We also note that Camk2a
and Camk2b are one of the candidate molecules underlying ho-
meostatic process S. In this study, we focused on the production
and phenotype-analysis of global knockout mice. The obvious
next step will be the cell-type-specific analysis of these regula-
tors of sleep duration found in this study (Susaki and Ueda,
2016). This new research field, i.e., the system-level identifica-
tion and analysis of the molecular networks underlying sleep/
wake cycles in mammals, will expand our detailed understand-
ing of sleep regulation, sleep disorders, and its associated dis-
eases such as psychiatric diseases in the years to come.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Details are also supplied in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Simulations
The AN model was constructed by simplifying previously published Hodgkin-
Huxley-type models of the electrophysiology of cortical neuron network into
the AN. The full system of equations is presented in Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures. The parameter values are shown in Table S1. Parameter
searches for SWS firing patterns were conducted in the defined parameter
space including biophysically reasonable parameter values. In the bifurcation
analysis, each parameter value was gradually varied from the parameter sets
that give SWS firing patterns obtained from parameter searches. Transitions
from SWS firing patterns to awake firing patterns were then counted.
Animals and Sleep Phenotyping
All experimental procedures and housing conditions involving animals and their
care were approved by the Animal Care and the Use Committee. Sleep pheno-
typing was done non-invasively by SSS. Creation and sleep phenotyping of
several KO mice were done in University of Tokyo by using C57BL/6N mice
(n = 101) as control information (Figures 3D–3F; Figures 7J–7M). All other exper-
iments were done in RIKEN by using C57BL/6N mice (n = 108) published in our
previous paper as control information (Sunagawa et al., 2016). The basal EEG/
EMG recording for Kcnn2 KO mice was performed in University of Tokyo. Sleep
deprivation experiment using gentle handling of Kcnn2 KO mice was conducted
after the basal EEG/EMG recording. CRISPR-KO animals were generated by
one-cell embryo microinjection of synthesized Cas9 mRNA and gRNAs (mix of
three targeting sequences; template sequences are shown in Table S2) to
C57BL/6N fertilized eggs. KO genotype was confirmed by qPCR and/or
genomic sequencing. Wealso used Arc-dVenus Tgmice(line D) (Eguchiand Ya-
maguchi, 2009) for MK-801 administration experiments and CUBIC analysis.
Pharmacological Administration
C57BL/6N or C57BL/6J mice received an i.p. injection of synthesized PCP
or MK-801 maleate in each concentration (Figures 4A–4D; Figures S5A–
S5D) at ZT2, respectively. For chronic administration of MK-801, the drug
was administered to C57BL/6J mice and Arc-dVenus mice as drinking water
in each concentration. For EEG/EMG recording and FISH, 2 mg/kg of
MK-801 was injected i.p. to C57BL/6N mice at ZT2.
CUBIC Analysis of Arc-dVenus Tg Animals
Fixed brains of Arc-dVenus mice were cleared and their whole brain images
were acquired and subjected to generate 3D NIfTI-1 files as previously re-
ported (Susaki et al., 2014, 2015), with some modifications. The Arc-dVenus
signals were normalized and used for comparison. The hyper-activated cells
were detected using the Fiji software (Schindelin et al., 2012) or analyzed by
creating binary mask for each anatomical region and applied it to the recon-
structed 3D images showing only hyper-activated cells. Querying specific
regions relies on images aligned to the Allen Brain Atlas (Lein et al., 2007).
The intensity within each region can be also used to estimate the number of
hyper-activated cells. Clustering and hierarchical annotation of anatomical
regions were performed to the dataset (Figure 5; Figures 6A–6D).
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization
The FISH protocol was based on TAI-FISH (Xiu et al., 2014) with some modi-
fications. The RNA probes for hybridization (PCR primers for probe templates
are shown in Table S5) labeled with digoxigenin (DIG)-UTP or fluorescein (Flu)-
UTP and detected as cyanine 3 or Alexa Fluor 488 signals, respectively. Sig-
nals were amplified with Tyramide Signal Amplification system (PerkinElmer).
Images of these sections were acquired with an inverted confocal microscope
(FV1200/IX83) and an upright fluorescent microscope (BX51, Olympus) and
were analyzed with ImageJ (Preibisch et al., 2009).
