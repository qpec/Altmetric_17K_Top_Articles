Abstract
Background
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly heterogeneous and aggressive disease,
and although no effective targeted therapies are available to date, about one-third of
patients with TNBC achieve pathologic complete response (pCR) from standard-of-care
anthracycline/taxane (ACT) chemotherapy. The heterogeneity of these tumors, however,
has hindered the discovery of effective biomarkers to identify such patients.
Methods and Findings
We performed whole exome sequencing on 29 TNBC cases from the MD Anderson Cancer
Center (MDACC) selected because they had either pCR (n = 18) or extensive residual dis-
ease (n = 11) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA; n = 144) and METABRIC (n = 278) cohorts serving as validation cohorts. Our analy-
sis revealed that mutations in the AR- and FOXA1-regulated networks, in which BRCA1
plays a key role, are associated with significantly higher sensitivity to ACT chemotherapy in
the MDACC cohort (pCR rate of 94.1% compared to 16.6% in tumors without mutations in
AR/FOXA1 pathway, adjusted p = 0.02) and significantly better survival outcome in the
TCGA TNBC cohort (log-rank test, p = 0.05). Combined analysis of DNA sequencing, DNA
methylation, and RNA sequencing identified tumors of a distinct BRCA-deficient (BRCA-D)
TNBC subtype characterized by low levels of wild-type BRCA1/2 expression. Patients with
functionally BRCA-D tumors had significantly better survival with standard-of-care chemo-
therapy than patients whose tumors were not BRCA-D (log-rank test, p = 0.021), and they
had significantly higher mutation burden (p < 0.001) and presented clonal neoantigens that
were associated with increased immune cell activity. A transcriptional signature of BRCA-D
TNBC tumors was independently validated to be significantly associated with improved

tions include the small size and potential selection bias in the discovery cohort.
Conclusions
The comprehensive molecular analysis presented in this study directly links BRCA defi-
ciency with increased clonal mutation burden and significantly enhanced chemosensitivity
in TNBC and suggests that functional RNA-based BRCA deficiency needs to be further
examined in TNBC.
Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• Identifying chemosensitive triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) could significantly
impact the survival of patients with these difficult to treat cancers until novel targeted
therapies become available.
• We hypothesized that genomic somatic aberrations may provide important molecular
clues about chemosensitivity in TNBC.
• Our study used a carefully selected cohort of 29 uniformly treated TNBC patients who
either achieved pathologic complete response (pCR) or had extensive residual disease
after neoadjuvant anthracycline/taxane chemotherapy.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• We sequenced the coding genomic DNA of TNBC tumors and compared the somatic
mutations found in the two groups at the two extremes of the chemosensitivity
spectrum.
• Our analysis revealed that, although mutations in single genes were not individually pre-
dictive, TNBC tumors bearing mutations in genes involved in the androgen receptor
(AR) and FOXA1 pathways were much more sensitive to chemotherapy.
• We also found that mutations that lowered the levels of functional BRCA1 or BRCA2
RNA were associated with significantly better survival outcomes; we derived a BRCA
deficiency signature to define this new, highly chemosensitive subtype of TNBC.
• BRCA-deficient TNBC tumors have a higher rate of clonal mutation burden, defined as
more clonal tumors with a higher number of mutations per clone, and are also associated
with a higher level of immune activation, which may explain their greater chemosensitivity.
What Do These Findings Mean?
• Mutations in the AR/FOXA1 pathway provide a novel marker for identifying chemo-
sensitive TNBC patients who may benefit from current standard-of-care chemotherapy
regimens.

cal benefit for these patients.

Introduction
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) disproportionately affects younger women and women
of African ancestry, contributing to health disparities. In the era of personalized cancer ther-
apy, patients with TNBC remain at considerably higher risk of relapse and death than patients
with other breast cancer subtypes, due to the aggressive nature of TNBC and the lack of newer
targeted therapies [1,2]. TNBC patients typically receive chemotherapy with anthracycline and
cyclophosphamide followed by taxane (anthracycline/taxane [ACT]) as standard-of-care treat-
ment. Approximately one-third of patients achieve pathologic complete response (pCR) and
have excellent survival, but the remaining patients relapse and eventually die of the disease [3–
5]. Identifying those TNBC patients who might benefit from ACT chemotherapy and directing
the remaining patients to novel targeted therapies may be an effective strategy with near-term
clinical impact for managing TNBC.
Transcriptional signatures developed in the past decade to predict sensitivity to ACT che-
motherapy in TNBC have had only partial success [6–8], in part owing to the extensive molec-
ular heterogeneity of the disease [9,10]. A few studies have evaluated whether predictability
can be improved by considering a tumor’s somatic genetic aberrations alone [11,12] or in
combination with gene expression [13]. Recent next-generation sequencing efforts have iden-
tified genes recurrently mutated in TNBC, including TP53 and PIK3CA, but unfortunately
have not yielded any new predictive or prognostic clues [12,14]. Among existing markers of
chemosensitivity, BRCA germline mutation carriers are known to receive greater benefit from
platinum-based chemotherapy [15] and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in
TNBC and ovarian cancers [16–18], but it is unclear whether patients with these tumors also
benefit from ACT chemotherapy. Furthermore, higher prevalence of tumor-infiltrating lym-
phocytes (TILs) has been associated with better prognosis [19–22], irrespective of the chemo-
therapy administered, and also with a higher rate of pCR to neoadjuvant anthracycline-based
chemotherapy in TNBC [23]. Gene expression signatures that capture immune or stromal
characteristics have shown promising prognostic performance [24,25].
Chemosensitive or chemoresistant phenotypes can arise in genomically heterogeneous can-
cers through diverse molecular mechanisms, resulting in weaker biomarker–phenotype associ-
ations at the population level and confounding the discovery of prognostic and predictive
biomarkers associated with response. Moreover, mutations alone may not be generally predic-
tive, as gene expression levels are also modulated through non-genetic mechanisms, such as
epigenetic silencing, aberrant transcription, and allele-specific expression [26–28]. Broader
tumor genomic metrics that capture the extent and diversity of genetic heterogeneity within
single tumors, such as overall mutation load and clonality, could be promising biomarkers and
have been reported to be associated with patients’ clinical outcome in melanoma and in head
and neck cancers [29,30]. There is also renewed interest in the enhanced innate immune

 response triggered by neoantigens from mutated cancer cell DNA, especially in tumors with
mismatch repair deficiency [31], a mechanism that may provide a potential link between
BRCA-deficiency-related chemosensitivity and the protective effect of TILs in TNBC.
In this study, we present a comprehensive assessment of chemosensitivity and resistance to
ACT in TNBC using whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify tumor genomic aberrations
that are potentially predictive of response. We used a TNBC cohort from the MD Anderson
Cancer Center (MDACC) consisting of both extremely sensitive and highly recalcitrant
tumors to identify mutations in specific genes or pathways that may indicate response or resis-
tance to ACT chemotherapy in TNBC, and validated our findings in a larger TNBC cohort
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. We used integrated whole exome, DNA
methylation, copy number variation, and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data to expand the defi-
nition of TNBC subgroups associated with better outcome.
Methods
Sample Collection and Datasets
MDACC cohort.
This study was designed as a follow-up from a previous study [6] and
did not have a specific prospective analysis plan. Twenty-nine TNBC samples were selected
from a prospectively collected tissue bank of fine needle aspiration biopsies obtained prior to
preoperative ACT chemotherapy at the MDACC [6] to represent two extreme response
groups: patients achieving pCR (n = 18) and patients with extensive residual disease (RD)
(n = 11) at surgery. All samples from patients in the two response groups from the original
cohort of 205 TNBC cases that had tissue available for DNA extraction were included. Patients
provided written informed consent in the original study [6]. Clinicopathologic information
for these cases is provided in Table 1. This discovery cohort was used to identify mutations
associated with response or resistance to ACT chemotherapy.
TCGA cohort. We selected 144 TNBC samples from the TCGA breast cancer cohort
(https://gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov/projects/TCGA-BRCA) based on estrogen receptor (ER), pro-
gesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) status, when available, or
basal-like PAM50 breast cancer subtype (https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn1700525) if
IHC was missing (Fig 1). We excluded 19 cases because of inadequate follow up (<30 d) and
two cases with metastatic disease, resulting in 123 TNBC cases. WES-derived somatic and
germline variants were available for 102 of these cases. In addition to WES, RNAseq V2 nor-
malized gene expression and DNA methylation (Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip;
Illumina) data were available for 101 of these cases and were accessed from the TCGA Data
Portal (https://gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov/projects/TCGA-BRCA). Copy number variation data
from SNP arrays were accessed from the Broad GDAC Firehose (http://gdac.broadinstitute.
org/). Variant allele frequency of somatic mutations was obtained from exome sequencing
alignment and RNAseq alignment data from the Cancer Genomics Hub (https://cghub.ucsc.
edu/). In addition, we accessed the curated mutations of the overlapped TCGA samples to per-
form mutation signature analysis [32]. Predicted neoantigens for the same 102 TNBC cases
from the TCGA cohort were directly obtained from a previous study [33]. The majority of the
TCGA TNBC cases (90%) received ACT chemotherapy, 6% received platinum-based thera-
pies, and none received targeted therapies (Fig 1). The TCGA cohort was used in analyses to
validate mutations identified in the MDACC discovery cohort and their association with sur-
vival outcomes. This dataset was also used to define the BRCA-deficient (BRCA-D) subtype
based on wild-type (WT) BRCA transcript expression and to derive a transcriptional signature
for this subtype. We also used this dataset to analyze the association of BRCA deficiency with
clonal mutation burden (CMB) and immune activation.

 METABRIC cohort. We identified 278 basal-like breast cancer cases (because receptor
status determined by IHC was not available for all cases) treated with chemotherapy from the
METABRIC (Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium) dataset. The
clinical outcomes and normalized gene expression data generated on the Illumina HumanHT-
12 platform were accessed from https://sagebionetworks.jira.com/wiki/display/BCC. Probes
from intronic gene regions were excluded from the analysis. We used this cohort as indepen-
dent validation that patients with BRCA-D TNBC tumors selected based on the transcriptional
signature have improved survival outcomes.
Whole Exome Sequencing and Variant Calling
After DNA extraction from the fine needle aspiration biopsies, 1 μg of genomic DNA was
sheared to a mean fragment length of about 140 bp. A NimbleGen human solution-capture
exome array (SeqCap EZ v2) was used to capture the exomes of tumor samples, using a

 significant association with clinical outcomes were manually visualized in the Integrative
Genomics Viewer (https://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/) to filter potential false positive calls.
Raw WES data and mutation calls from the MDACC TNBC cohort are deposited in the
Sequence Read Archive (accession ID SRP063902; http://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?
study=SRP063902).
Genomic Biomarker Analyses
Gene level.
For the MDACC cohort, we applied the MutSigCV algorithm [34] to detect
mutations in driver genes occurring above the background mutation rate (MR) with false dis-
covery rate < 10%. Only significant non-silent mutations were aggregated at the gene level to
test for association with clinical outcome.
Pathway level. We collected 714 canonical pathways from the National Cancer Institute
Pathway Interaction Database (http://pid.nci.nih.gov/) and BioCarta (http://www.biocarta.
com/). We applied five algorithms, PhyloP, SIFT, PolyPhen2, MutationTaster, and LRT, to
predict the functional impact of mutations. We selected high functional impact single nucleo-
tide variants predicted as deleterious by at least three algorithms and all the INDELs. High
functional impact variants were aggregated at the pathway level to test for association with che-
motherapy response and distant relapse-free survival.
Broad genomic metrics.
MR was calculated as the total number of mutations detected,
normalized by the length of target exome sequenced with at least 10-fold coverage. The mutant
allele tumor heterogeneity (MATH) score for a tumor was calculated as the median absolute
deviation divided by the median MAF of all somatic mutations detected in the tumor sample.
As previously suggested [30], for the calculation of MATH we used somatic mutation calls
with MAF of 0.075 or greater. For these analyses, we started with the exome sequence align-
ment (BAM) files provided by TCGA and called somatic mutations using MuTect.
Tumor Clonal Analysis
The R package SciClone [35] was used to infer tumor clonality by clustering variants of similar
MAF from a tumor sample. We only selected mutations with at least 10-fold coverage and
MAF < 0.6 to exclude mutations that may involve copy number loss. Variants were clustered
using a Bayesian binomial mixture model in SciClone with each cluster representing a separate
clone in the tumor. The average number of mutations per clone in each sample was calculated
as the weighted sum of the number of mutations in each clone multiplied by the clonal propor-
tion estimated by SciClone.
Mutational Signature Analysis
The trinucleotide loadings for four mutational signatures previously identified in breast can-
cer, Signature.1B (age associated), Signature.2 (APOBEC), Signature.3 (BRCA), and Signa-
ture.6 (mismatch), were downloaded from a previous study [32]. We applied non-negative
least squares to estimate the proportion of each signature in each sample, and the signature
with the greatest estimated coefficient was designated the dominant signature.
BRCA Deficiency Analysis
Epigenetic silencing of BRCA1.
We averaged the beta value of four robust probes
(cg19531713, cg19088651, cg08993267, and cg04658354) in the promoter region of BRCA1
from the Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip [36]. BRCA1 DNA methylation was cate-
gorized as unmethylated (score < 0.2) or methylated (score > 0.2).

 Wild-type BRCA1/2 expression quantification and definition of BRCA1/2 deficiency.
We downloaded RNAseq data analyzed by pipeline V2 using MapSplice and RSEM (https://
wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/TCGA/RNASeq). We used normalized count of BRCA1/2 as the mea-
sure of overall expression. In cases harboring a BRCA1/2 mutation, we extracted the BRCA1/2
locus (Assembly GRCh37.p13) from the RNAseq alignment file, quantified the MAF in the
mutation position, and then calculated the WT BRCA1/2 expression as:
ExpressionðBRCA1=2WTÞ ¼ ExpressionðBRCA1=2TotalÞð1 � MAFÞ:
In cases with multiple BRCA mutations, WT BRCA1/2 expression was based on the muta-
tion with the highest MAF. We extended the definition of BRCA-D status to include (1) at
least one deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation or (2) for BRCA WT patients, WT BRCA1/2 expres-
sion less than the maximum observed in mutation carriers in the cohort.
BRCA-deficient gene expression signature.
We developed a BRCA deficiency transcrip-
tional signature to assess the predictive potential of BRCA deficiency status in additional data-
sets. Differentially expressed genes between BRCA-D and BRCA-normal (BRCA-N) cases in
the TCGA TNBC cohort were identified using the Bioconductor limma package [37] (unad-
justed p < 0.002). Genes with median expression less than 25% of the overall median were
excluded. A BRCA deficiency metagene was defined as the mean expression of genes overex-
pressed in BRCA-D cases minus the mean expression of genes overexpressed in BRCA-N
cases. Transcriptional BRCA deficiency status for each case was determined by the median
dichotomized metagene score. We used the Kaplan-Meier survival estimator and Cox propor-
tional hazards regression to assess the association of BRCA deficiency metagene expression
with overall survival in TNBC cases in the TCGA and METABRIC datasets.
Statistical Analysis
The association between mutational status (at the gene or pathway level) and pCR rate or over-
all survival was assessed using the Fisher exact test and the Kaplan-Meier survival estimator,
respectively. Wilcoxon rank tests were used to compare characteristics (MR, MATH score,
number of neoantigens, and mutation signature) between groups (pCR versus RD, BRCA-D
versus BRCA-N).
Results
Mutations Associated with Chemosensitivity in Triple Negative Breast
Cancer
We sequenced the genomic DNA from 29 cases in two response groups (pCR, n = 18; RD, i.e.,
chemoresistant with moderate or extensive residual cancer burden [38], n = 11) using WES
(mean nucleotide coverage 150×; more than 90% of target bases had >20× coverage in all sam-
ples). Most detected somatic mutations were not recurrent, and only the MR of TP53 was sig-
nificantly above background across all samples (false discovery rate < 0.1 using MutSigCV
[34]). Twenty-two of 29 tumors (76%) carried non-silent TP53 mutations (S1 Fig), but there
was no evidence of association with chemosensitivity (Fisher exact test, p > 0.5).
Functional mutations in nine canonical biological pathways were associated with chemo-
therapy response (Fisher exact test, p < 0.05; S1 Table). Due to the small size of the response
groups, we applied a bootstrap strategy to evaluate the robustness of these associations under

 network,” remained significant, with mutations in both pathways being associated with pCR.
Considering their substantial overlap (14 genes in common out of 59 in the androgen receptor
[AR] pathway and 58 in the FOXA1 pathway), we merged the two pathways into the “AR- and
FOXA1-regulated network.” Tumors carrying mutations in the AR/FOXA1 pathway had a sig-
nificantly higher pCR rate (94.1% compared to 16.6% in tumors without such mutations,
q = 0.02 after Bonferroni correction; Fig 2B). Furthermore, functional mutations occurred
almost exclusively in chemosensitive tumors (21/22, or 95% of mutations) except for a single
truncating BRCA1 mutation found in one RD tumor with AJCC stage IIIB cancer but minimal
residual cancer burden (Fig 2A; Table 1, sample id 757_004_004). At the gene level, 13 genes
had at least one mutation affecting 17 chemosensitive patients (58.6%) across the entire
cohort (Fig 2A). In most cases, different genes were mutated in individual tumors, and despite
the strong association observed at the pathway level, none of these genes individually had a

 significant association with pCR. Among them, BRCA1 was the most frequently mutated gene
(17%), and four of the mutations observed in the pCR cohort were associated with hereditary
breast cancers in the ClinVar database (S3 Fig). The BRCA1 mutation found in the tumor with
RD (Fig 2A; see also S3 Fig) is a stop-gain mutation also reported in ClinVar as pathogenic,
but due to lack of RNAseq data we could not assess the relative expression of mutant and WT
BRCA1 transcripts.
Mutational Burden and Clonality as Predictors of Chemosensitivity in
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
To assess whether broad genomic measures that capture the overall burden and heterogeneity
of somatic mutations are predictive of chemosensitivity, we calculated the MR and MATH
score in each TNBC tumor. We also estimated tumor clonality by applying clonal decomposi-
tion to the somatic mutation profile of each tumor, and confirmed a positive correlation
between the MATH score and the estimated number of clones in each tumor (S4 Fig). We
sought to combine MR and MATH into a composite score, which we called CMB, that cap-
tures both the clonality of a tumor and the number of somatic mutations per clone. MR and
MATH scores were median-dichotomized in the cohort, and CMB categories were defined as
low (low MR, high MATH), high (high MR, low MATH), or intermediate (all others). There
was an increasing tendency in the average number of mutations per clone from low to high
CMB (S5 Fig). The pCR rate in the low, intermediate, and high CMB tumors was 33%, 64%,
and 89%, respectively (Fig 2C), suggesting that tumors with a high number of mutations per
clone (small number of clones, high MR) have significantly better response (p = 0.05) than low
CMB tumors, which may be subclonal or have an overall low MR. The CMB categories were
not significantly associated with other clinical or pathologic characteristics such as tumor stage
or grade, or with patient’s age.
AR/FOXA1 Mutations Predict Better Clinical Outcome in Triple Negative
Breast Cancer Tumors from TCGA
To validate our findings, we selected TCGA TNBC samples based on IHC status and PAM50 sub-
type, excluded stage IV cancers and cases with short follow-up, and downloaded available pro-
cessed data of WES, RNAseq, DNA methylation, and copy number variation (Fig 1; S2 Table).
Among the 102 TNBC cases from the TCGA cohort with available exome sequencing data,
19 had at least one functional somatic mutation in the AR/FOXA1 pathway and 35 had at least
one functional somatic mutation in the AR/FOXA1 pathway or at least one germline BRCA1
mutation. As with the MDACC cohort, BRCA1 was most frequently mutated among this gene
set, with 21 (20%) patients carrying germline mutations and two (2%) carrying somatic muta-
tions (Fig 3A). Patients with at least one mutation in one of the genes in this pathway had excel-
lent overall survival, while those with WT genes had significantly worse outcomes (p = 0.028;
Fig 3B). We observed a similar trend when we considered only somatic mutations (S6 Fig).
Validation of Clonal Mutation Burden as Biomarker of Chemosensitivity
in TCGA
We computed the MR and MATH score in 101 TCGA TNBC cases with available exome
sequence alignment data. Also in this cohort, the MATH score was positively correlated with
the estimated number of clones (R = 0.44, p < 0.001; S7 Fig). Cases were stratified into three
categories of CMB using the same criteria as with the MDACC cohort. Tumors with high
CMB harbored a significantly higher average number of mutations per clone than tumors with

significantly improved overall survival rate (p = 0.029) compared to patients with tumors with
low CMB (Fig 3C).

 of function variants in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes lead to homologous recombination defects and
may contribute to sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy, but it is yet unclear whether
this deficiency is associated with improved benefit from standard-of-care ACT chemotherapy.
Besides germline and somatic mutations, deletions or epigenetic silencing can also result in
DNA repair deficiency in a large proportion of TNBC cases. Here we systematically evaluated
BRCA deficiency in TNBC using integrated analysis of DNA sequencing, DNA methylation,
and RNAseq data from TCGA and assessed its association with clinical outcome.
Among the 101 TNBCs from the TCGA dataset, 21 tumors (20.5%) had inactivating germ-
line SNP or somatic mutations in BRCA1, four (3.9%) in BRCA2, and two (1.9%) in both (Fig
4A and 4B). One hotspot germline SNP (rs1799950; Q356R in exon 10) was particularly com-
mon in this cohort, appearing in 15 cases (S3 Fig). Furthermore, we assessed the copy number
variation in BRCA1/2 and promoter hypermethylation in BRCA1. Although different types of
abnormalities are associated with BRCA1/2 inactivation, they all result in low expression of
functional WT BRCA transcript. In mutation carriers, WT transcript abundance was deter-
mined from the overall expression, and MAF from RNAseq data. As expected, the abundance
of WT BRCA1/2 transcripts was significantly lower in mutation carriers than in non-carriers
(p < 10−16; Fig 4A and 4B). We therefore defined the BRCA1/2 deficiency threshold as the
maximum level of WT BRCA1/2 transcript expressed in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. That
threshold is indicated by an arrow in Fig 4A and 4B. Tumors with WT BRCA1/2 transcript
abundance below the corresponding threshold were classified as BRCA-D. This includes all
the cases with germline or somatic mutations, or deep loss, or epigenetic silencing of the
BRCA genes.
Based on this expanded definition of BRCA deficiency, 48 TNBC cases (47%) were charac-
terized as BRCA-D. Specifically, 43 cases (42%) were BRCA1 deficient, nine (9%) were BRCA2
deficient, and four (4%) were deficient in both (Fig 4C). This definition captured all the cases
with BRCA mutation, BRCA1 promoter methylation, or BRCA deletion, but also an additional
nine cases (9%) that expressed low levels of WT BRCA transcripts for unknown reasons. We
applied non-negative linear regression to 76 tumors with available mutation context data to
estimate the proportion of mutations explained by the BRCA, age, APOBEC, and mismatch
repair mutational signatures in each sample. The BRCA signature was dominant in 78.8%
BRCA-D tumors (p < 0.001), the age signature was dominant in BRCA-N tumors (p = 0.004),
and the APOBEC signature was more often present in BRCA-N tumors (14%) than in
BRCA-D tumors (p = 0.03; Fig 4C). Furthermore, BRCA-D tumors were associated with sig-
nificantly higher MRs based on non-silent (p < 0.001) or silent (p = 0.02) mutations, but had
clonal heterogeneity (p = 0.55) similar to that of BRCA-N TNBC tumors (S9 Fig).
Triple Negative Breast Cancer Tumors of BRCA-Deficient Subtype
Benefit from Anthracycline/Taxane Chemotherapy
We found that expression of WT BRCA transcripts defines a new TNBC subtype (BRCA-D)
characterized by high MR but typical clonal heterogeneity. Moreover, TNBC tumors with high
CMB were highly enriched in BRCA-D tumors (67%) compared to tumors of low CMB (7%)
(p < 0.001; Fig 5A), suggesting that BRCA1/2-mediated homologous recombination defi-
ciency is associated with tumors of high CMB that were extremely sensitive to ACT chemo-
therapy in the MDACC cohort (Fig 2C).
Patients with BRCA-D tumors had 100% 4-y overall survival, compared to 79.5% (95% CI
66.6%–94.9%) for BRCA-N tumors (log-rank test, p = 0.018; Fig 5B), in the TCGA TNBC
cohort. To further validate this finding in an independent dataset of TNBC cases without
requiring RNA and DNA sequencing data, we developed a gene expression signature that

 predicts BRCA-D status in the TCGA dataset. We identified 24 genes that were strongly over-
expressed and 26 genes that were underexpressed in BRCA-D compared to BRCA-N cases
(arbitrary cutoff, unadjusted p < 0.002; S10 Fig). Among the 50 genes identified (S3 Table),

 BRCA1 was the gene most strongly associated with BRCA deficiency (p < 0.001). For each
sample, a BRCA deficiency signature score was computed as the mean expression of the 24
overexpressed genes minus the mean expression of the 26 underexpressed genes. The score

 was median-dichotomized to predict BRCA-D status if high or BRCA-N status if low. The pre-
dictor of BRCA deficiency status had a sensitivity of 85.4% and specificity of 81.5% for predict-
ing BRCA deficiency status in the TCGA cohort where it was developed. Furthermore, the
patients with predicted BRCA-D tumors had significantly better overall survival than patients
with predicted BRCA-N tumors (log-rank test, p = 0.013; Fig 5C). We applied the BRCA defi-
ciency signature to an independent cohort of 278 chemotherapy-treated TNBC cases from the
METABRIC cohort, which validated that patients with tumors predicted to be BRCA-D by the
gene signature had significantly better overall survival compared to patients with tumors pre-
dicted to be BRCA-N (log-rank test, p = 0.009; Fig 5D).
Link between Clonal Mutation Burden, BRCA Deficiency, and Immune
Activation in Triple Negative Breast Cancer
In our analysis we discovered that BRCA deficiency is associated with higher CMB and that
both BRCA deficiency and high CMB are predictive of chemosensitivity in TNBC. Given that
a high prevalence of TILs has often been associated with better response in TNBC, we wanted
to further investigate whether high CMB and BRCA deficiency are associated with higher
immune activation. In the TCGA TNBC cohort, we observed a strong correlation between the
overall MR and the number of predicted neoantigens (Spearman correlation = 0.76; Fig 6A).
Due to higher overall MR, BRCA-D tumors had a significantly greater number of predicted
neoantigens compared to BRCA-N tumors (p = 0.003; S11 Fig). Additionally, to estimate
immune cell prevalence we used the average expression of the lymphocyte-specific genes
GZMB, PRF1, CXCL13, IRF1, IKZF1, and HLA-E in each tumor sample [39]. Interestingly,
tumors with predominantly clonal mutations were associated with higher immune presence
compared to those with subclonal mutations (p = 0.003; Fig 6B), implying a negative associa-
tion between clonal heterogeneity and immune response (S12 Fig). Therefore, tumors with
high CMB harbor a greater number of predicted neoantigens per clone (Fig 6C), which elicit a
higher immune response (Fig 6D). In summary, our analysis suggests a connection between
BRCA deficiency status and high CMB, which results in a greater number of clonal neoanti-
gens, leading to immune activation and potentially mediating enhanced response to ACT che-
motherapy in TNBC.
Discussion
We report results from an integrated genomic analysis of a TNBC cohort deliberately selected
to represent extremely chemosensitive tumors and tumors highly resistant to standard-of-care
ACT chemotherapy. Although no significant associations were identified between recurrent
functional somatic mutations in specific genes and chemotherapy response, aggregating at the
pathway level revealed that mutations occurring in two pathways, “regulation of androgen
receptor activity” and “FOXA1 transcription factor network,” were significantly associated
with pCR in TNBC (94% pCR rate in tumors with mutated pathways versus 17% in tumors
without such mutations). Furthermore, TNBC patients from the TCGA cohort whose tumors
had at least one mutation in the above pathways had excellent survival, with no deaths
observed in 4 y when treated with ACT-containing regimens.
TNBC is highly heterogeneous, and up to six different subtypes have been recognized by
transcriptional profiling, each associated with different clinical outcomes and responses to
therapy [40,41]. One subtype, the luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtype, is characterized
by luminal gene expression driven by the AR and is generally associated with low response to
chemotherapy [40]. The AR is expressed in about 10%–40% of TNBCs, but its role in progno-
sis or as a potential therapeutic target in TNBC has remained controversial [42]. In TNBC,

 signaling through the AR is hypothesized to mimic ER signaling, initiating transcriptional acti-
vation that promotes cell growth through the involvement of the transcription factor FOXA1
[43]. This has provided a justification for targeting AR in AR-positive TNBC. Recent single-
arm phase II studies that evaluated the effect of the AR antagonists bicalutamide and enzaluta-
mide in metastatic AR+ TNBC reported 6-mo clinical benefit rates of 19% and 29%, respec-
tively [44,45], suggesting a direct role of AR in this TNBC subtype. Our results are consistent

 with the above observations, suggesting that mutations in the AR/FOXA1 pathway could result
in abrogation of AR-related signaling, resulting in improved sensitivity to standard chemo-
therapy and better overall survival.
TNBC tumors are characterized by broad genomic and transcriptional heterogeneity [10,14].
The extent of genomic and transcriptional heterogeneity in tumors appears to be associated with
resistance to chemotherapy in TNBC [10] and with worse prognosis in head and neck cancer
[30]. Furthermore, high somatic mutation load has been linked to favorable outcomes in pancre-
atic cancer [46] but to worse prognosis in ER-positive breast cancer [47]. In our assessment of
broad genomic measures as potential predictors of chemosensitivity, we found that patients with
tumors with high CMB, defined as high mutational load but low clonality or a high number of
somatic mutations per clone, have a significantly higher pCR rate (89%) and excellent survival
(no deaths in 4 y in the TCGA cohort) compared to patients with tumors with low CMB (pCR
rate of 33%). Therefore, the clonality of a tumor appears be critical in determining chemotherapy
sensitivity and survival outcome. Tumors with high mutation load, for instance due to defective
DNA damage response pathways, are sensitive to chemotherapy provided that they are not sub-
clonal, that is, they do not contain mutations of lower variant allele frequencies that would have
originated from subclones arising later in the tumor’s clonal expansion. Subclonal tumors con-
tain not only the clonal mutations that were present in the founding cell but also subclonal muta-
tions that emerged in subsequent clones during clonal expansion and thus exhibit broader
genetic heterogeneity, which contributes to resistance to chemotherapy [48–50].
BRCA1 and BRCA2 are critical for the process of DNA repair by homologous recombina-
tion repair (HRR), and deficient HRR makes cancers more susceptible to DNA-damaging
agents. Familial BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutant breast tumors tend to have a TNBC phenotype and
often exhibit extreme levels of genomic instability [51]. The “BRCAness” phenotype is more
broadly defined as defective HRR, driven not only by germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations
but also by somatic mutations or other alterations in these or other genes involved in HRR
[52]. Indeed, ovarian tumors with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, either germline or somatic,
are associated with higher mutational burden and better survival outcomes following treat-
ment with platinum-based chemotherapy [53] or PARP inhibitors [54]. In TNBC, germline
BRCA1 mutation carriers were found to have higher pCR rates to neoadjuvant ACT chemo-
therapy compared to non-carriers (46% versus 22%) and significantly better survival outcomes
[55]. Similar results were reported in TNBC with promoter methylation of BRCA1, where
BRCA1 methylation was associated with better survival outcomes following adjuvant ACT che-
motherapy [56]. Our broad definition of BRCA deficiency from RNAseq data based on the
level of WT BRCA transcripts incorporates the effect of all genomic aberrations leading to
inadequate levels of functional BRCA. This broader definition of BRCA deficiency included
46% of the TNBC tumors in the TCGA cohort; this subset had an excellent survival outcome
(100% 4-y survival) following adjuvant ACT chemotherapy. Although the evidence provided
by the survival data in the TCGA cohort is somewhat limited due to shorter follow-up and a
lower number of deaths observed than expected for TNBC, the effect of BRCA deficiency was
confirmed in the METABRIC cohort, which has 10 y of follow-up and more representative
overall survival for TNBC. Our analysis therefore suggests that a definition of BRCA deficiency
based on RNAseq could be a clinically useful biomarker of chemosensitivity for TNBC.
Immunotherapy is now emerging as a potentially viable therapeutic option for TNBC
patients [57], but this treatment is expected to be effective only for a subset of the patients. Anti-
bodies against programmed death 1 (PD-1) were significantly more effective in mismatch-
repair-deficient colorectal cancers, most likely due to an increased number of neoantigens in
these tumors [31]. We observed that BRCA-D TNBC tumors are characterized by high CMB
and carry a greater number of predicted neoantigens that tend to be clonal. This could be the

 reason for the higher level of immune infiltration observed in these tumors [58] and may have
contributed to the improved response to ACT chemotherapy that we observed. These results
suggest that the combination of immunotherapies with ACT chemotherapy or PARP inhibitors
might be an effective strategy for treating BRCA-D tumors. This is currently being evaluated in
a phase I/II study in BRCA-D ovarian cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov; study ID NCT02571725).
In summary, we have provided an integrated characterization of the chemotherapy
response phenotypes in TNBC. The strong connection of ACT chemosensitivity and immune
activity with a new transcriptionally defined BRCA-D phenotype could help inform future
therapeutic strategies for TNBC patients.
Limitations of our single-institution retrospective study include the small size of the discov-
ery cohort and potential selection bias as samples were included based on both chemotherapy
response and availability of residual biopsy materials for DNA isolation. Given the genomic het-
erogeneity of TNBC, this might limit the generalizability of our results. Another limitation is
the lack of tumor-matched normal DNA for these tumors, which may result in reduced sensitiv-
ity and specificity for detecting somatic mutations in this cohort. Although our observation that
mutations in AR/FOXA1 genes are associated with better outcomes in ACT-treated TNBC
patients was validated in the TCGA cohort, the low number of events observed in this cohort
limits the power of the analysis. Yet, our key finding that BRCA-D TNBC tumors identified by
the BRCA deficiency signature are indeed associated with better outcomes after chemotherapy
was confirmed in both the TCGA and METABRIC datasets. Although these findings will
require validation in larger multi-institutional datasets, preferably originating from prospective
clinical studies, they could provide the impetus for examining BRCA deficiency in TNBC in the
context of increased CMB, with potentially improved response to immunotherapies.
