ABSTRACT
Objective The purpose of this study was to assess the
feasibility of community screening for atrial fibrillation
(AF) using a smartphone-based wireless single-lead ECG
(SL-ECG) and to generate epidemiological data on the
prevalence and risk factors of AF in Hong Kong.
Methods In the period between 1 May 2014 to 30
April 2015, 13 122 Hong Kong citizens consented and
voluntarily participated in a territory-wide community-
based AF screening programme.
Results 56 (0.4%) out of 13 122 SL-ECG were
uninterpretable. 101 (0.8%) participants had newly
diagnosed AF, with 66 (65.3%) being asymptomatic.
The congestive heart failure, hypertension, age>75
(doubled), diabetes, stroke(doubled), vascular disease,
age 65–74, sex(female) score (CHA2DS2VASc score) of
participants with newly diagnosed AF was 3.1±1.3. The
prevalence rates for AF detected by SL-ECG was 1.8%
and for AF detected by SL-ECG or self-reported by
participants was 8.5%. Using multivariable logistic
regression analysis, independent predictors of AF include
age, sex, height, weight, body mass index, history of
heart failure, valvular heart disease, stroke,
hyperlipidaemia, coronary artery disease, peripheral
artery disease and cardiothoracic surgery.
Conclusion Community screening for AF with SL-ECG
was feasible and it identified a significant proportion of
citizens with newly diagnosed AF. The prevalence of AF
in a Chinese population in Hong Kong was comparable
with that of contemporary Western counterparts. Apart
from age and sex, different anthropometric parameters
and cardiovascular comorbid conditions were identified
as independent predictors of AF.
INTRODUCTION
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sus-
tained cardiac arrhythmia.1 AF is associated with
an increased risk of stroke, heart failure and cardio-
vascular mortality.2 Although oral anticoagulation
treatment
can
effectively
reduce
the
risk
of
AF-related ischaemic stroke by 64%–70%,3 around
a quarter of patients have silent or asymptomatic
AF,
which
can
still
cause
this
complication.4
Opportunistic screening for AF is currently recom-
mended.3 However, whether systematic screening
for AF can reduce the burden of ischaemic stroke
remains controversial.5 On the other hand, the
experience and data on the use of smartphone-
based wireless single-lead ECG (SL-ECG) in com-
munity screening for AF have been scarce and
based on a relatively small number of subjects.6 7
There are only a few epidemiological studies on
the prevalence and risk factors of AF in the
Chinese population and none of them were per-
formed in Hong Kong.8–11 Thus, the purpose of
this study was to assess the feasibility of community
screening for AF using SL-ECG and to generate
epidemiological data on the prevalence and risk
factors of AF in Hong Kong.
METHODS
Study population
In the period between 1 May 2014 to 30 April
2015, 13 122 Hong Kong citizens voluntarily parti-
cipated in a territory-wide community-based sys-
tematic AF screening programme. Informed consent
was obtained. The screening programme was publi-
cised via different channels including media promo-
tion and placement of posters in community centres
by non-governmental organisations in Hong Kong
and all citizens aged 18 or above were eligible for
participation. The population in Hong Kong in
mid-2014 was estimated to be 7.24 million. The
Princess
Margaret
Hospital
Ethics
Committee
approved the study protocol. Information on history
and symptom of AF and medical conditions were
assessed by an interview questionnaire. For symp-
toms of AF, participants were asked whether they
had ever experienced palpitations. Anthropometric
measurements, including body weight, height and
waist circumference, were taken. A SL-ECG was
performed with the AliveCor device (AliveCor,
San Francisco, California, USA).
ECG acquisition and analysis
SL-ECG was performed by a group of trained non-
medical
volunteers
using
the
AliveCor
device
(AliveCor, San Francisco, California, USA). The
device consists of a smartphone software applica-
tion and a small handheld hardware component
attached to or in close proximity to the phone.6
The participant was instructed to place fingers of
both hands on the two electrodes of the hardware
component and a 30 s lead I ECG would be
recorded. All recorded ECGs were reviewed by the
first author of this manuscript within 1 month of
the performance of SL-ECG. The ECGs were clas-
sified into three groups, namely sinus rhythm, AF
and uninterpretable. Participants with uninterpret-
able
SL-ECG
were
referred
for
conventional
12-lead ECGs, which were reviewed by the first
author of this manuscript.
Categories of AF
AF was reported if it was observed in the entire
30 s recording of the SL-ECG. AF detected by
SL-ECG likely represented non-paroxysmal AF.

 Participants who reported history of AF but did not have AF
detected by SL-ECG likely had paroxysmal AF. Participants who
did not report history of AF but had AF detected by SL-ECG
were regarded to have newly diagnosed AF. The total burden of
AF, both paroxysmal and non-paroxysmal, in the study popula-
tion can be represented by AF detected by SL-ECG or self-
reported by participants. All participants who had AF detected
by SL-ECG were referred for medical consultation.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were presented as mean±SD and categor-
ical variables as numbers and proportions. Continuous variables
were compared using the Student’s t-test. Categorical variables
were compared using the Fisher’s exact test or χ2 test. The inde-
pendent predictors of AF detected by SL-ECG, newly diagnosed
AF and AF detected by SL-ECG or self-reported by participants
were modelled by multivariable logistic regression. A univariate
analysis was performed and variables with a p value of <0.2
were included for multivariable analysis. Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed and areas under
the curve (AUCs) were calculated for the discriminative ability
of different independent predictors identified for newly diag-
nosed AF. Statistics were performed with the Statistical Package
for Social Science (IBM SPSS (V
.19), Chicago, Illinois, USA).
A p value of <0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics and predictors of AF
The baseline characteristics of 13 122 Hong Kong citizens who
participated in the AF community screening programme are
summarised in tables 1 and 2. In Table 1, comparison is made
between participants who had AF detected by SL-ECG and
those who had not. In table 2, comparison is made between par-
ticipants who had AF detected by SL-ECG or who self-reported
AF and those who had no AF. Among all participants, 3377
reported ‘don’t know’ for a history of AF, of which, 62 had AF
detected by SL-ECG. Therefore, 3315 (3377−62) participants
were excluded from this analysis and 8696 (13122 minus 1111
minus 3315) participants with no AF formed the comparison
group. Using multivariable logistic regression, independent pre-
dictors of AF detected by SL-ECG include age, weight, body
mass index (BMI), history of heart failure, stroke, valvular heart
disease and cardiothoracic surgery (table 3). On the other hand,
independent predictors of AF detected by SL-ECG or self-
reported by participants include age, height, history of hyperlip-
idaemia, heart failure, stroke, coronary artery disease, valvular
heart disease, peripheral artery disease and cardiothoracic
surgery (table 4).
Prevalence of AF
The overall prevalence of AF detected by SL-ECG, which likely
represented non-paroxysmal AF, was 1.8% (239/13 122; 95%
CI 1.6% to 2%) with a higher prevalence in men (2.8%, 105/
3738; 95% CI 2.3% to 3.3%) than women (1.4%, 134/9384;
95% CI 1.2% to 1.6%). The overall prevalence of AF detected
by SL-ECG or self-reported by participants was 8.5% (1111/
13 122; 95% CI 8% to 9%) with similarly a higher prevalence
in men (10.6%, 395/3738; 95% CI 9.6% to 11.6%) than
women (7.6%, 716/9384; 95% CI 7.1% to 8.1%). Thus, the
number and proportion of participants who likely had paroxys-
mal AF was 872 (1111 minus 239) and 78% (872/1111)
respectively. For both AF categories, the prevalence increased
with age (tables 5 and 6).
Ability to detect newly diagnosed AF by community
screening and its feasibility using SL-ECG
Of the 13 122 SL-ECG, 56 (0.4%) were uninterpretable. A total
of 101 (42.2% of AF detected by SL-ECG or 0.8% of all parti-
cipants) participants had newly diagnosed AF with this screen-
ing programme. The number of participants with previously
known AF was 1010 and there was a 10% (101/1010) increase
in the prevalence rate of AF with this screening programme.
Among the participants with newly diagnosed AF, 66 partici-
pants (65.3%) were asymptomatic. There was no significant

Independent predictors of newly diagnosed AF include age,
weight, stroke and valvular heart disease. Female sex predicted a
lower risk for newly diagnosed AF (table 8). The ROC curves
were constructed for the discriminative ability of age and weight
for newly diagnosed AF. The AUCs for age and weight were
0.768 and 0.548, respectively. When a cut-off age threshold of
60 or above was used, there was a 98% sensitivity and 29.2%
specificity in detecting newly diagnosed AF.

 is a latent and symptomatic stage, the natural history is under-
stood, there is an agreed policy on whom to treat, the cost of
finding is economically balanced with overall health and the
case finding is a continuous process.12 Last but not the least, the
screening test should be suitable and acceptable to the popula-
tion. Recent advances in smartphone and wireless technology
has enabled ECG screening for cardiac arrhythmias without the
use of 12-lead ECG machines.7
13 In the current study, a
smartphone-based wireless single-lead ECG was used as a
screening tool for AF in a large population of 13 122 citizens in
the community of Hong Kong. To the best of our knowledge,
this is currently the largest study in mass screening for AF in the
general population. Only 0.4% of ECGs, which were performed
by trained non-medical volunteers were uninterpretable. This
lends strong support to the technical ease and feasibility of
SL-ECG in community screening for AF. Svennberg et al5 per-
formed a mass screening for AF in 7173 Swedish inhabitants
aged
75–76 years.
A
single-lead
ECG
recorder
(Zenicor,
Zenicor Medical Systems, Stockholm, Sweden) was used for
screening. Diagnosis was difficult in 3.5% of participants and
24-hour ECG monitoring was required. Compared with the
0.4% uninterpretable ECGs in our study, there was an appar-
ently higher failure rate of ECG diagnosis in their study. The
question whether there is a genuine performance difference
between the two SL-ECG technologies or whether it was merely
due to a difference in study methodology requires further study.
In their study, newly diagnosed AF was found in 0.5% of the
screened population on the first ECG and it was found in 3% of
the screened population with repeated ECGs performed twice
daily and on palpitations. In our study, only a single ECG was
performed and we found that 42.2% of participants with AF
detected by SL-ECG (0.8% of all participants) were previously
undiagnosed and they had a mean CHA2DS2VASc score of 3.1
±1.3. Most of them were therefore recommended oral anticoa-
gulants for stroke prevention. As shown in other studies, asymp-
tomatic AF was common. At least one-third of patients with AF
were asymptomatic and only a fifth of the patients with
symptomatic AF had symptoms temporally related to AF epi-
sodes.14–16 More importantly, around a quarter of patients with
ischaemic stroke had asymptomatic or silent AF.4 In our partici-
pants with newly diagnosed AF, 65.3% were asymptomatic and
this may explain why they remained undiagnosed before screen-
ing. W
e have shown that a population-based screening pro-
gramme with a smartphone-based wireless single-lead ECG is
feasible in identifying previously undiagnosed AF with low rate
of uninterpretable ECGs. On the other hand, evidenced from
our data, there was a high proportion of asymptomatic AF in
participants who were not previously diagnosed of arrhythmia.
Whether a systematic population-based ECG screening for AF,
instead of an opportunistic approach as recommended by the
current guidelines,3 leads to a reduction in the incidence of
stroke in a community requires a well-designed randomised con-
trolled study. From our study, we found that age was a variable
with good discriminative ability for newly diagnosed AF with an
AUC of 0.768 in screening the general population. On the other
hand, we observed a steep rise in the prevalence of AF from
the age of 60 onwards with a sensitivity of 98% and specificity
of 29.2% in detecting newly diagnosed AF. This may serve as an
age cut-off criterion to improve the cost-effectiveness of AF
screening in the community.
Prevalence and risk factors of AF
Interpretation of prevalence studies on AF has been difficult
because of difference in methodology, especially in the defin-
ition of AF cases, the ethnic population under study and the
time of data collection. A single ECG was performed to detect
AF in some studies,17 18 while, in others, history of AF was also
taken into account in the counting of cases.9 10 19 In general, a
higher prevalence of AF has been observed in whites compared
with Asians, blacks and Hispanics.20 21 The time of data collec-
tion in different studies can also vary by a few decades. DeWilde
et al19 observed an increase in prevalence of AF from 0.78% to

 1.31% in men and 0.79% to 1.15% in women from 1994 to
2003. In our study, we observed an overall prevalence of AF
detected by SL-ECG to be 1.8%, with 2.8% in men and 1.4%
in women. The prevalence increased with age for both men and
women. These prevalence rates are consistent with the data
from Singapore18 and Korea.22 The overall prevalence of AF
detected by SL-ECG or self-reported by participants was 8.5%,
with 10.6% in men and 7.6% in women. This category of AF
likely represents both non-paroxysmal and paroxysmal AF.
Interestingly, these prevalence rates are comparable with those
observed in some recent studies on the US and European
populations but much higher than those reported in studies on
the Chinese population. Shen et al23 reported AF prevalence
rates of 9.8% in men and 6.5% in women in the whites from
the data of a large California health maintenance organisation.
Similarly, Krijthe et al24 reported AF prevalence rates of 8.6%
in men and 7.1% in women in a Dutch population. In contrast,
Zhou and Hu,9 in a study performed in 2004, observed a much
lower prevalence rate of AF in a Chinese population with
0.91% in men and 0.65% in women. The remarkable difference
in prevalence rates observed in our study, which was also per-
formed on a Chinese population, may be due to a real

 epidemiological expansion over a decade, difference in environ-
mental factors in Hong Kong compared with Mainland China
or a selection bias in the current study. Interestingly, Guo et al8
also recently reported an observation of epidemiological expan-
sion in AF burden for the years 2001–2012 in the southwest of
China.
Epidemiological studies revealed a wide variety of risk factors
for AF, which include age, male gender, hypertension, diabetes,
coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, congestive heart
failure and hyperthyroidism.1 25–27 In our study, we have identi-
fied age, heart failure, valvular heart disease, history of stroke
and cardiothoracic surgery as independent predictors of AF
detected by SL-ECG, which may represent persistent AF. In add-
ition to these predictors, hyperlipidaemia, coronary artery
disease and peripheral artery disease were found to be inde-
pendent predictors of AF detected by SL-ECG or self-reported
by participants, which likely include both paroxysmal and non-
paroxysmal AF. With the growing worldwide epidemic of
obesity,28 it has been increasingly recognised as a risk factor for
AF. On the other hand, individual anthropometric parameters
like weight and height have also been shown to be risk factors
of AF.5 Interestingly, in our study, we also found weight as an
independent predictor for AF detected by SL-ECG, while height
was identified as an independent predictor for AF detected by
SL-ECG or self-reported by participants. In contrast with some
studies, male gender was not found to be an independent pre-
dictor for these two categories of AF in our study. The higher
prevalence of these two categories of AF in men compared with
women was likely a result of the former being on average taller
and heavier. The finding that a higher BMI independently pre-
dicted a lower risk for AF detected by SL-ECG in our study is
provocative and inconsistent with some studies.29 30 However, if
both higher weight and height independently predicted a higher
risk of AF, as observed in our and other studies,5 the predictabil-
ity of AF with BMI becomes a function of both height and
weight. The exact relationship between different anthropometric
parameters, like weight, height and BMI, and AF requires
further large-scale research to clarify.
LIMITATIONS
Since the recruitment of citizens to participate in the screening
programme was non-randomised, selection bias might occur.
The participants self-reported their medical history, including
history of AF and other comorbid conditions. The information
provided might not be accurate and a significant proportion of
participants did not know whether they had a history of AF.
SL-ECG with single-lead tracing was used in the diagnosis of
AF. No conventional 12-lead ECG was performed as reference.
However, all SL-ECGs were analysed by a cardiologist and there
was only a very low proportion of ECGs being uninterpretable.
On the other hand, since only SL-ECG with single-lead tracing
was performed for each participant, arrhythmias other than AF
might be missed. Although we have shown in our study that
nearly half of the participants who had AF detected by SL-ECG
were newly diagnosed with the help of a community-based
screening programme, further studies are required to show that
these participants will proceed to seek and comply with appro-
priate medical treatment and that a territory-wide community-
based AF screening programme will lead to a reduction in the
incidence of stroke. Last, this was a report on 13 122 citizens
who participated in an AF screening programme in Hong Kong
which is populated by over 7 million inhabitants. This study was
not designed to assess the administrative feasibility, for example,
uptake of the programme and efficiency of the recruitment
procedure and cost-effectiveness of a community-based AF
screening programme. Therefore, whether a similar screening
programme can be recommended to other communities requires
further study.
CONCLUSION
Community screening of AF with a smartphone-based wireless
single-lead ECG was feasible and identified a significant propor-
tion of citizens with newly diagnosed AF. The proportion of
‘uninterpretable’ ECGs with this screening tool was very low.
The prevalence of AF in this large population sample in Hong
Kong increased with age and rose steeply from age of 60
onwards which may serve as an age cut-off criterion in the
future community-based AF screening programme. Apart from
age and sex, height, weight, BMI, history of heart failure, valvu-
lar heart disease, stroke, hyperlipidaemia, coronary artery
disease, peripheral artery disease and cardiothoracic surgery
were identified as independent predictors of AF.
Key messages
What is already known on this subject?
The role of systematic screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) in
reducing the burden of ischaemic stroke remains controversial.
The data on the prevalence and risk factors of AF in the Chinese
population especially in Hong Kong are limited.
What might this study add?
Community screening for AF with smartphone-based wireless
single-lead ECG was feasible and it identified a significant
proportion of citizens with newly diagnosed AF. The prevalence
of AF in a Chinese population in Hong Kong was comparable
with that of contemporary Western counterparts. Apart from
age and sex, different anthropometric parameters and
cardiovascular comorbid conditions were identified as
independent predictors of AF.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
A systematic population-based ECG screening for AF, instead of
an opportunistic approach as recommended by the current
guidelines, may lead to a reduction in the incidence of stroke in
a community, and a well-designed randomised controlled study
is required.
