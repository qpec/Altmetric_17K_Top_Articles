IMPORTANCE Health care spending in the United States increased substantially from 1995 to
2015 and comprised 17.8% of the economy in 2015. Understanding the relationship between
known factors and spending increases over time could inform policy efforts to contain future
spending growth.
OBJECTIVE To quantify changes in spending associated with 5 fundamental factors related to
health care spending in the United States: population size, population age structure, disease
prevalence or incidence, service utilization, and service price and intensity.
DESIGN AND SETTING Data on the 5 factors from 1996 through 2013 were extracted for 155
health conditions, 36 age and sex groups, and 6 types of care from the Global Burden of
Disease 2015 study and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation’
s US Disease
Expenditure 2013 project. Decomposition analysis was performed to estimate the association
between changes in these factors and changes in health care spending and to estimate the
variability across health conditions and types of care.
EXPOSURES Change in population size, population aging, disease prevalence or incidence,
service utilization, or service price and intensity.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Change in health care spending from 1996 through 2013.
RESULTS After adjustments for price inflation, annual health care spending on inpatient,
ambulatory, retail pharmaceutical, nursing facility, emergency department, and dental care
increased by $933.5 billion between 1996 and 2013, from $1.2 trillion to $2.1 trillion.
Increases in US population size were associated with a 23.1% (uncertainty interval [UI],
23.1%-23.1%), or $269.5 (UI, $269.0-$270.0) billion, spending increase; aging of the
population was associated with an 11.6% (UI, 11.4%-11.8%), or $135.7 (UI, $133.3-$137.7) billion,
spending increase. Changes in disease prevalence or incidence were associated with
spending reductions of 2.4% (UI, 0.9%-3.8%), or $28.2 (UI, $10.5-$44.4) billion, whereas
changes in service utilization were not associated with a statistically significant change
in spending. Changes in service price and intensity were associated with a 50.0%
(UI, 45.0%-55.0%), or $583.5 (UI, $525.2-$641.4) billion, spending increase. The influence
of these 5 factors varied by health condition and type of care. For example, the increase
in annual diabetes spending between 1996 and 2013 was $64.4 (UI, $57.9-$70.6) billion;
$44.4 (UI, $38.7-$49.6) billion of this increase was pharmaceutical spending.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Increases in US health care spending from 1996 through 2013
were largely related to increases in health care service price and intensity but were also
positively associated with population growth and aging and negatively associated with
disease prevalence or incidence. Understanding these factors and their variability across
health conditions and types of care may inform policy efforts to contain health care spending.

 S
pendingonhealthcareintheUnitedStatesishigherthan
in any other country and is increasing. According to of-
ficial US records, total health spending in 2015 reached
$3.2 trillion and constituted 17.8% of the US economy.1
Even after adjusting for inflation, the annualized growth rate
in US health care spending between 1995 and 2015 was 4.0%.1
This growth is in excess of the rate of growth of the total US
economy, which was 2.4% during this same period.2
Although higher spending on health is not inherently
bad, policy discussions in the United States often center
around “bending the health care cost curve.
”3 When devising
policy to evaluate spending efficiency or to contain spending,
it is important to know the specific areas in which spending is
increasing, as well as the factors contributing to spending
increases. Previous research has provided insight into areas
of spending growth,4 but little is known about what specifi-
cally is contributing to this growth, especially for specific
conditions or types of care. Various factors, including popula-
tion aging, disease prevalence, cost of care, and technology,
have been implicated as factors that can increase health
spending.5-8 Yet there is little consensus in the existing litera-
ture about which of these factors are most responsible for
increased health care spending and even less information
about how the effect of these factors varies by health condi-
tion or type of care.5
To evaluate the association of key factors with increases
in health care spending for each health condition and type of
care, this study combined the most detailed US health care
spending database with similarly detailed disease prevalence
and incidence data. This data set allowed for an analysis of
the association of 5 fundamental factors with growth in
health care spending: changes in population size, the aging of
the population, and changes in disease prevalence or inci-
dence, service utilization, and service price and intensity.
Methods
This study received review and approval from the University
of Washington institutional review board; because data were
deidentified, informed consent was waived.
Data Sources
This study relied on 2 main data sources: the US Disease
Expenditure 2013 project and the Global Burden of Dis-
ease 2015 study.
Disease Expenditure 2013 Project
Estimates of personal health care spending and service vol-
ume were extracted from the US Disease Expenditure 2013
project.4 That study estimated US health care spending and
service volume for each year from 1996 to 2013 and synthe-
sized information on health care spending from 183 sources,
leveraging the strength of each source to produce modeled
estimates of spending and volume disaggregated by 155
health conditions, 38 age and sex groups, and 6 types of care:
ambulatory, inpatient, emergency department, dental, retail
pharmaceutical, and nursing facility care. Several adjust-
ments, including adjustments for comorbidities and adjust-
ments to account for the difference between charge and
payment data, were applied to improve accuracy of the esti-
mates.Theseadjusteddatatrackspendingassociatedwitheach
disease rather than simply spending associated with the pri-
mary diagnosis appearing in the raw data. Spending esti-
mates were also scaled to the official estimate of US health
spending contained in the National Health Expenditure Ac-
counts, which ensured that no spending was counted twice.
All spending estimates from the project data set were ad-
justed for inflation and expressed in 2015 dollars. Spending on
patients 85 years and older was combined with spending on
patients aged 80 to 84 years to create 36 age and sex groups
and to match the age and sex categories for our other data
sources.Moredetailedinformationonthemethodsusedinthe
Disease Expenditure project is reported in the eMethods in the
Supplement and has been published.4,9-11
Global Burden of Disease Study
Population and epidemiologic data, including prevalence
and incidence for each health condition, were extracted
from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2015 study.12 The
GBD study estimated prevalence, incidence, deaths, and
other epidemiologic metrics by age and sex groups for 315
conditions, for years 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and
2015. To estimate disease incidence and prevalence for each
age and sex group in the United States, 1604 data sources
were used, including hospital data, claims data, and surveys.
A Bayesian meta-regression tool developed specifically for
the GBD, DisMod-MR, was used to generate the modeled
estimates of prevalence and incidence.13 GBD health condi-
tions were aggregated to reflect the health conditions used
in the Disease Expenditure project, with more details pro-
vided in the eMethods in the Supplement. To interpolate
disease incidence and prevalence for the years that GBD
does not report, log-linear interpolation was used for each
age and sex group. Interpolation introduced additional
uncertainty that is not included in estimates, although for
most conditions included in this study, prevalence and inci-
dence rates remained relatively constant across the study,
and substantive short-term variations in the disease preva-
lence or incidence associated with the most expensive
health conditions is unlikely.
Key Points
Question How are 5 factors—population growth, population
aging, disease prevalence or incidence, service utilization, and
service price and intensity—associated with health care spending
increases in the United States from 1996 to 2013?
Findings Health care spending increased by $933.5 billion from
1996 to 2013. Service price and intensity alone accounted for more
than 50% of the spending increase, although the association of the 5
factors with spending varied by type of care and health condition.
Meaning Understanding the factors associated with health care
spending increases, and their variability across conditions and types
of care, can inform policy efforts to contain health care spending.

 Age and Sex Standardization and Case Standardization
The relationship between changes in population size and age
structure and spending growth were explored by comparing
unadjusted spending growth rates with age- and sex-
standardizedgrowthrates.Ageandsexstandardizationiscom-
monly used to compare health outcomes that are dependent
on the age structure of a population.14 To standardize 1996
spending to reflect the 2013 population profile, spending per
person was calculated for each of the health conditions and
for36ageandsexgroupsin1996,andthosefractionsweremul-
tiplied by the 2013 age- and sex-specific population esti-
mates. The annualized rate of change was then calculated be-
tweenadjusted1996valuesandtheobserved2013values.This
procedure estimated changes in spending that would have oc-
curred even if the 1996 and 2013 population size and age and
sex structure were the same.
Case-standardizedgrowthrateswerealsomeasured.Spend-
ing per prevalent case was calculated for each health condi-
tion and for 36 age and sex groups in 1996, and those fractions
weremultipliedby2013age-andsex-specificprevalentcasees-
timates. Using these standardized 1996 estimates, annualized
rates of change were estimated to report the change that would
haveoccurredevenifthenumberofprevalentcasesin1996and
2013 was the same. For injuries and cancers, spending per in-
cident case was calculated, because spending for these condi-
tions is associated more with incidence than with prevalence.
Five-Factor Decomposition
For each of the 155 health conditions, 36 age and sex groups,
6 types of care, and 18 years of the study, 5 variables were con-
structed:(1)thetotalUSpopulation,(2)thefractionofthepopu-
lation living in each age and sex group, (3) the disease preva-
lence or incidence, (4) service utilization, and (5) service price
and intensity. Disease prevalence was used for all health con-
ditions except injuries and cancers, for which incidence was
used. Service utilization and service price and intensity were
measured differently for the different types of care (Table). For
ambulatory, emergency department, and dental care, service
utilization was measured as the mean visits per prevalent or
incident case, while service price and intensity was the mean
spending per visit. For inpatient and nursing facility care, ser-
vice utilization was the mean bed-days per prevalent case,
while service price and intensity was the mean spending per
bed-day. For retail pharmaceuticals, service utilization was the
mean number of purchased prescriptions per prevalent case,
while service price and intensity was the mean spending per
purchased prescription. Changes in service intensity in-
cluded the use of new technology.
The final data set included yearly estimates of all 5 fac-
tors for 1996 through 2013. Because the data from the
Disease Expenditure project and interpolated GBD data are
each complete without missing values, no additional data
estimation or imputation were needed. Because not all
health conditions exist for all age and sex groups and types of
care, the 5 factors were measured for 21 713 unique combina-
tions of condition, age and sex, and type of care, for each
year. Five conditions (diphtheria, intestinal infectious dis-
eases, measles, vitamin A deficiency, and tetanus) and sev-
eral outlier cases were excluded because the related preva-
lence data were too low to allow for accurate estimation.
As defined in this study, health care spending is the prod-
uct of these 5 fundamental factors, as shown in the equation

where a indicates age; s, sex; c, condition; t, type of care; and

a demographic decomposition described by Das Gupta in 1993
was used.15 This decomposition relied on the identity above
tocalculatetheadditivecontributionsofeachfactortochanges
in health spending from 1996-2013. The equation is com-
pletely additive and does not involve any residual terms.
Quantifying Uncertainty
To estimate uncertainty, 1000 draws of estimates were ex-
tracted from both the Disease Expenditure and GBD data-
bases.Eachdrawrepresents1statisticalestimate,andthevaria-
tion of these draws captures uncertainty associated with these
input data. The measurement of rates of change, standard-
ized rates of change, and the decomposition analysis were all
completed on each of the 1000 draws independently so that
data uncertainty was propagated throughout the entire pro-
cess, and the reported uncertainty intervals (UIs) reflect all
sources of uncertainty in both the input data estimation and
the deterministic decomposition calculation. The reported es-
timates are the mean and the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of
the 1000 estimates. More details about implementation of the
5-factor decomposition, including code, are reported in the
eMethods in the Supplement.
All statistical analyses were completed using Stata ver-
sion 13.1 (StataCorp) and R versions 3.3.2 and 3.4.0 (R Foun-
dation for Statistical Computing), as well as several user-
written R packages.16-22

 spending. Figure 1 shows health care spending increases and
growth rates between 1996 and 2013. During this period,
inflation-adjusted spending on inpatient, ambulatory, retail
pharmaceutical, nursing facility, emergency department,
and dental care increased at an annualized rate of 3.5%, from
$1.2 trillion to $2.1 trillion. Across all health conditions, the
greatest annualized growth rates were in emergency depart-
ment care and retail pharmaceutical spending, at 6.4% and
5.6%, respectively. The condition with the greatest absolute
increase in spending was diabetes, which increased at an
annualized rate of 6.1% (UI, 5.3% to 7.0%), or $64.4 (UI,
$57.9 to $70.6) billion. Most of this increase was related to
increases in retail pharmaceutical spending. Low back and
neck pain had the second-largest increase in health care
spending, increasing at an annualized rate of 6.5% (UI, 5.3%
to 7.7%), or $57.2 (UI, $47.4 to $64.4) billion between 1996
and 2013. In absolute terms, this increase was concentrated
in ambulatory care and inpatient care. Spending increases
on the treatment of hypertension ($47.6 [UI, $41.7 to
$53.7] billion), the treatment of hyperlipidemia ($41.9 [UI,
$37.7 to $45.4] billion), and depressive disorders ($30.8 [UI,
$25.3 to $36.8] billion) were also notable.
Figure 2 shows age- and sex-standardized health spend-
ing increases and growth rates (top panel). This panel shows
spendingfactorsnotrelatedtodemographicchanges.Aftercon-
trolling for population size and age structure, the increase in
annualspendingwas$573.8(UI,$570.6to$577.3)billion.Even
after adjusting for population size and age structure, diabetes
and low back and neck pain remained the conditions with the
largest increases in annual spending, although the increases
and annualized growth rates decreased. Falls, the health con-
dition with the seventh largest increase in annual spending,
was no longer among the 10 health conditions with the high-
est growth after adjustment for age and sex.
Figure 2 also shows case-standardized health spending in-
creases and growth rates (bottom panel). Because differ-
ences in prevalence over time are controlled for, this panel re-
ports growth associated with changes in health system service
variables such as service utilization, price, and intensity. Dia-
betes went from showing the biggest change in spending to the
fourth biggest change. After controlling for the number of
prevalent cases, the health conditions with the largest growth
in spending were low back and neck pain, treatment of hyper-
tension, and treatment of hyperlipidemia.
The 5-factor decomposition assessed 150 health condi-
tions and tracked a $931.4 billion increase in US personal
health care spending. (Diphtheria, intestinal infectious dis-
eases, measles, vitamin A deficiency, and tetanus were
removed because they did not have sufficient amount of
prevalent cases to compete the decomposition.) The increase
in population size was associated with a 23.1% (UI, 23.1% to
23.1%) increase in spending between 1996 and 2013, while
population aging was associated with an 11.6% (UI, 11.4% to
11.8%) increase in spending (Figure 3). Change in disease
prevalence or incidence was associated with a reduction in
spending overall (2.4% [UI, 0.9% to 3.8%]), as was change in
service utilization (2.5% [UI, −7.8% to +2.9%]). However, the
relationship varied by condition category. Within cardiovas-
cular diseases, decreases in prevalence were associated with
a 20.7% (UI, 16.5% to 26.2%) reduction in spending, while
among all other conditions together, decreases in prevalence
or incidence were associated with a 1.1% increase (UI, −0.9%
to +3.7%). Relationships between changes in utilization and
cost growth also differed by type of care. Decreases in bed-
days were associated with a 45.9% (UI, 40.7% to 51.9%)
reduction in spending in the inpatient setting, whereas utili-
zation increases were associated with a 67.1% (UI, 48.9% to
85.6%) increase in spending on pharmaceuticals. In contrast,
increases in service price and intensity were associated with
a 50.0% (UI, 45.0% to 55.0%) increase in spending between
1996 and 2013, although this association varied by type of
care and health condition. Five-factor decomposition esti-
mates reported in this article can be interactively explored at
http://vizhub.healthdata.org/dex/.
Figure 4 shows that annual spending on ambulatory
care increased by $324.3 billion between 1996 and 2013, the
most of any of the 6 types of care, from $381.5 billion in
1996 to $706.4 billion in 2013. The colored bars of Figure 4,
Figure 5, Figure 6, and Figure 7 show the results of decom-
position analyses associating each of the 5 factors with
annual spending by type of care between 1996 and 2013.
Increases in service utilization (more visits per case) were
associated with a $115.5 (UI, $73.8 to $158.9) billion increase
in ambulatory care spending. Greater service price and
intensity (more spending per visit) was associated with an
increase of $92.5 (UI, $53.7 to $130.7) billion in ambulatory
care spending. Population size was associated with an $88.6
(UI, $88.4 to $88.8) billion increase in ambulatory care
spending and age structure with a $33.7 (UI, $32.1 to $35.0)
billion increase. Reductions in the number of prevalent
cases between 1996 and 2013 for some expensive health
conditions, such as ischemic heart disease and hyperten-
sion, were associated with a $6.0 billion reduction (UI,
−$15.1 to +$3.1 billion) in ambulatory care spending.
Annual spending on inpatient care increased by $258.1
billion between 1996 and 2013 (Figure 4), from $438.0 bil-
lion in 1996 to $697.0 billion in 2013. Like ambulatory care,
population size and population age structure were associ-
ated with increases in inpatient spending, and disease
prevalence or incidence with a slight reduction in spending.
Service utilization and service price and intensity had oppo-
site relationships with inpatient spending increases during
this period. Reductions in inpatient bed-days per prevalent
or incident case were associated with a reduction of $201.1
(UI, $178.3 to $227.1) billion in annual spending, whereas
increases in spending per bed-day were associated with a
$333.7 (UI, $315.2 to $350.9) billion increase in annual inpa-
tient health spending.
Figure 4 shows that across the other types of care,
changes in service price and intensity were positively associ-
ated with spending increases, in particular for emergency
department care ($58.0 [UI, $54.5 to $61.9] billion) and dental
care ($38.1 [UI, $16.2 to $57.2] billion). Similarly, increases in
population size and age were associated with increases in
spending for all types of care. Increases in service utilization
(purchased prescriptions per prevalent case) were associated

 with $76.1 (UI, $55.4 to $97.0) billion in retail pharmaceutical
spending increases.
Figure 5 shows that the 5 factors were related to the indi-
vidual health conditions in distinct ways. Within diabetes,
which experienced the largest spending increase, increases
were concentrated within retail pharmaceuticals ($44.4 [UI,
$38.7 to $49.6] billion). Within retail pharmaceuticals, all 5 fac-
tors were associated with spending growth: there were more
people, the people were generally older, age-standardized
diabetes prevalence increased, there were more retail phar-
maceuticals prescribed per prevalent case, and the mean
spending per pharmaceutical increased. Across these 5 fac-
tors, service price and intensity was associated with the larg-
est increase ($20.0 [UI, $12.1 to $27.5] billion). All 5 factors were
also associated with increased diabetes spending in ambula-
tory care settings.
The health condition with the second largest increase in
annual spending was low back and neck pain. Within this con-
dition,thelargestincreaseswereforambulatorycare($31.5[UI,
$22.1 to $38.3] billion) and inpatient care ($18.9 [UI, $15.7 to
$20.9] billion). Service utilization increases were associated
withspendingincreasewithinambulatorycare($22.2[UI,$15.8
to $27.3] billion), while service price and intensity was asso-
ciated with spending increases on inpatient care ($21.1 [UI,
$18.0 to $23.4] billion) for low back and neck pain.
The other 4 panels of Figure 5 show a diverse set of fac-
tors related to increases in spending on different health con-
ditions. Increases in depressive disorder spending was most
strongly associated with increases in spending on ambula-
tory care and retail pharmaceuticals, and all 5 factors were
related to increases in spending for each type of care.
Increases in spending on other neurologic disorders were
most strongly associated with increases in the utilization of
ambulatory care. Despite reductions in prevalence, there
were still net increases in spending on retail pharmaceuticals
for hyperlipidemia. In addition, increases in utilization were
associated with increases in spending on ambulatory care
and retail pharmaceuticals for the treatment of hypertension.
The relationship of the 5 factors with spending for each type
of care for each of the 150 conditions is reported in the eRe-
sults in the Supplement.
Figure 6 demonstrates that patterns in spending changes
and the factors associated with these changes differed by
broad age category. Service utilization was associated with
much larger increases in the 65 years and older age group
($42.1 [UI, $33.5 to $51.6] billion of the $74.3 [UI, $70.9 to
$77.5] billion increase in pharmaceutical spending), com-
pared with ages younger than 65 years ($33.9 [UI, $20.4 to
$47.2] billion of the $100.4 [UI, $97.2 to $103.7] billion
increase). Service utilization was also associated with the
largest spending increases within ambulatory care among
people 65 years and older ($50.6 [UI, $38.1 to $63.0] billion of
the $101.6 [UI, $95.9 to $107.6] billion increase in ambulatory
spending) compared with the younger age group ($64.8 [UI,
$34.8 to $97.7] billion of the $222.7 (UI, $216.9 to $228.4) bil-
lion increase). Spending on nursing facility care was more

 strongly related to overall spending changes for the older age
group, whereas emergency care and dental care were more
strongly related to overall spending changes for the younger
age group.
Figure 7 shows how the 5 factors were associated with
spending within each type of care over different periods.
From 1996 to 2002 and from 2002 to 2008, spending
increases were most associated with growth in service price
and intensity ($259.1 [UI, $201.5 to $311.1] billion and $198.9
[UI, $169.6 to $229.7] billion, respectively). The relationships
between the 5 factors and spending within different types of
care changed somewhat from 2008 to 2013. Service price and
intensity was negatively associated with spending on ambu-
latory care ($23.1 [UI, −$41.2 to +$1.6] billion), nursing facility
care ($6.7 [UI, $1.5 to $18.7] billion), and prescribed retail
pharmaceuticals ($4.4 [−$15.6 to +$6.6] billion).
Discussion
This study measured how 5 fundamental factors were collec-
tively associated with a $933.5 billion increase in annual US
health care spending between 1996 through 2013. Although
population size and age were associated with increased spend-
ing for most health conditions and types of care, the other 3
factors had varying relationships with spending, depending on

Other neurologic diseases actually had the fifth-largest increase in health care
spending but was omitted from this figure because it is a composite category
made up of disparate neurologic diseases not included in the 6 other categories
tracking spending on other neurologic diseases. The dental care category was
omitted from the figure because none of the spending on these 6 health
conditions is associated with dental care. Each colored bar corresponds to 1 of 5
factors and reflects the amount of spending change associated with that factor.
Bars to the left of the black vertical line (no change) indicate factors associated
with decreased spending; to the right of the line, factors associated with
increased spending within that type of care. The sum of the 5 bars equals the
total spending change, 1996 through 2013, indicated with a black square
marker. Error bars indicate uncertainty intervals; absence of error bars around a
marker indicates zero change. Condition-specific graphs for all health conditions

This study adds to existing literature that has measured
factors leading to increases in health care spending.23 These
existing studies, which typically focus on 1 or 2 factors,24 have
reached varying conclusions about which factors are associ-
ated with increases in health care spending.5,6,8,25 Some stud-
ies have suggested that spending increases are primarily at-
tributable to changes in the spending per treated case,5,7,26
often pointing to technology changes as a significant contribu-
tor to spending increases. The research presented here tests
and affirms these findings, demonstrating that service price
and intensity have had the strongest association with increas-
ing health care spending between 1996 and 2013 of the fac-
torsexamined,associatedwithtoa50.0%(UI,45.0%to55.0%)
increase overall. This increase was greatest in inpatient care
and was an especially large contributor to increases in spend-
ingonretailpharmaceuticalsfordiabetesandoninpatientcare
for low back and neck, among others. The present study dif-
fers from prior studies in its ability to separate increases in ser-
vice utilization from service price and intensity and to assess
these relationships independently for each health condition
and type of care.
The relationship between changes in service utilization
and spending has been more variable. Service utilization
in an inpatient setting has decreased between 1996 and 2013,
meaning there were in general fewer inpatient bed-days per
prevalent or incident case. This is observed for many health
conditions, including cardiovascular conditions, labor and
postpartum care, and low back and neck pain. This likely cor-
responds to encouragement from insurers and other groups
to minimize the number of inpatient days associated with each
admission.27 However, concurrent with reductions in inpa-
tient days, there have been increases in inpatient prices and
intensity of services. This relationship is somewhat tautologi-
cal, because for many cases the number of inpatient services
mayhavebeencompressedintoasmallernumberofdays,thus
leading to more spending per day. For most health condi-
tions, however, the increase in inpatient spending associated
with increases in price and intensity was greater than the re-
duction in spending associated with reductions in inpatient
utilization, yielding a net increase in inpatient spending. The
reduction in inpatient utilization has also occurred simulta-
neously with increases in ambulatory care and pharmaceuti-
cal utilization and in spending in these settings. This substi-
tution may reflect attempts to encourage less costly modalities
of care, as has been observed elsewhere.28
In addition to increases in cost per case, existing research
also has pointed to changes in disease prevalence or changes
indemographyasunderlyingfactorsfuelingincreasesinhealth
care spending.7,25 The finding in the present study that chang-
ing prevalence and incidence are less strongly associated with
spending increases—and in some cases are associated with
spending decreases—may be explained by the separation of
changes in population size and aging from changes in disease
prevalence or incidence. In addition, the protracted associa-
tions between disease prevalence and spending is also likely
attributable to the fact that this study measured the associa-
tions with changes in clinical prevalence, which is measured
by the GBD project. Because clinical disease prevalence or in-
cidence is used, increases in spending due to changes in health
care use will correspond to increases in service utilization. Pre-
vious research has underscored the importance of using clini-
cal prevalence rather than treated prevalence, because an in-
crease in spending attributed to treated prevalence might
actually be caused by more people receiving care.26 Despite
disease prevalence or incidence having a relatively small re-
lationship with spending growth across all diseases, changes
in prevalence or incidence were associated with sizable in-
creases or decreases for a number of specific health condi-
tions. Diabetes was one health condition for which increases
in disease prevalence were associated with increases in health
care spending, whereas cardiovascular diseases such as ische-
mic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease had reduc-
tions in disease prevalence between 1996 and 2013.
This study also corroborated existing research that points
to demography as a major factor underlying health care spend-
ing, although this study differentiated increases in spending
related to changes in population size vs changes in popula-
tion age structure. Although aging was positively associated
with spending increases, it was only the third-largest factor at
the aggregate level and was associated with only half (50.2%)
the spending increase of having a larger population. This sug-
gests either that the relationship between an aging popula-
tion and spending has yet to be realized or that the relation-
ship is weaker than anticipated, a finding corroborated by
previous work.23,29,30
These findings have a diverse set of policy implications.
For example, the finding that service price and intensity
are major contributing factors to spending growth may sug-
gest that policy efforts focused on reducing these factors could
hold promise for reducing health care spending. Condition-
specific analyses may point to particular health conditions to
which attention could be turned, such as the rising price of
pharmaceuticals for diabetes. In addition, the estimates de-
veloped here could also be used for forecasting the potential
effect of policies that alter particular factors associated with
cost growth, although such analyses were beyond the scope
of this project and could be considered only exploratory.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the expenditure
estimates from the Disease Expenditure project were not
separated by payer. Because public payers often pay lower
prices than private or out-of-pocket payers, performing
this analysis by payer could yield important insights. Second,
data on spending and disease burden were only captured at
the national level. Understanding subnational variation in
health care spending would provide critical evidence for poli-
cymakers acting at state and local levels. Third, the data used
for this study did not allow service price and intensity to be
disaggregated into the individual components of changing ser-
vice prices, intensity, and technology. To measure these dis-
tinct factors (which were aggregated in the present study),
data tracking specific services or treatments—or data track-
ing relative-value units—would be needed for each health

 condition, age and sex group, type of care, and year of this
study. This warrants further research. Fourth, estimates pro-
duced by the Disease Expenditure project only extended to
2013. The health care system is dynamic, and patterns may
have changed in the years since. Specifically, pharmaceutical
spending increased substantially in 2014 and 2015,1,31 and the
gradual implementation of the Affordable Care Act may have
contributed to other changes during this time. These data did
not capture more recent trends, but future updates to the Dis-
ease Expenditure project aim to remedy this.
Conclusions
Increases in US health care spending from 1996 through 2013
were largely related to increases in health care service price
and intensity but were also positively associated with popu-
lation growth and aging and negatively associated with dis-
ease prevalence or incidence. Understanding these factors and
their variability across health conditions and types of care can
inform policy efforts to contain health care spending.
