Abstract. Ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury during clinical 
hepatic procedures is characterized by inflammatory condi-
tions and the apoptosis of hepatocytes. Nuclear factor-κB 
(NF-κB), nitric oxide and the expression levels of inflam-
matory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1 
were observed to increase following IR and mediate the 
inflammatory response in the liver. CF102 is a highly selective 
A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) agonist, and has been identified 
to induce an anti‑inflammatory and protective effect on the 
liver via the downregulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. 
The present study aimed to determine the effect of CF102 on 
protecting the liver against IR injury. The potential protective 
effect of CF102 (100 µg/kg) was assessed using an IR injury 
model on 70% of the liver of Wistar rats, which was induced by 
clamping the hepatic vasculature for 30 min. The regenerative 
effect of CF102 was assessed by the partial hepatectomy of 
70% of the liver during 10 min of IR. CF102 reduced the levels 
of liver enzymes following IR injury. A higher regeneration 
rate in the CF102 treatment group was observed compared 
with the control group, suggesting that CF102 had a positive 
effect on the proliferation of hepatocytes following hepatec-
tomy. CF102 had a protective effect on the liver of Wistar rats 
subsequent to IR injury during hepatectomy. This may be due 
to an anti‑inflammatory and anti‑apoptotic effect mediated by 
the A3AR.
Introduction
Ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury occurs when the cellular 
damage of a hypoxic organ is increased subsequent to the resto-
ration of oxygen delivery. Warm IR injury may arise clinically 
in hepatic surgery, liver transplantation, hypovolemic shock 
and various types of toxic liver injury. The common denomi-
nator of the aforementioned conditions is the ʻlow‑flowʼ state 
induced by liver hypoxia, which may lead to ischemic hepatitis. 
The Pringle maneuver has been established as the occlusion of 
the hepatic artery and the portal vein by cross-clamping the 
porta hepatis with a vascular clamp. It is frequently used to 
control bleeding during the repair of extensive liver wounds, 
hepatic resection and liver transplantation. However, this may 
result in hepatic IR injury, in the event that the clamping the 
hepatic vasculature is performed for a long period of time.
Two distinct phases of liver injury have been identi-
fied following warm IR injury. The initial phase (<2 h after 
reperfusion) is characterized by oxidant stress, which directly 
results in hepatocellular injury. The late phase (6-48 h after 
hepatic reperfusion) is an inflammatory disorder mediated by 
recruited neutrophils (1).
Cellular hypoxia has been identified as the key factor 
that leads to the activation of the transcriptional regulator, 
nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and triggers the release of other 
inflammatory mediators, including activated Kupffer cells 
and neutrophils, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 
(IL)-1 and nitric oxide (NO), possibly in order to mediate the 
reperfusion injury process (2,3). The production of inflam-
matory mediators following the activation of Kupffer cells 
has been determined to be an important component for the 
pathophysiology of neutrophil-mediated injury during liver 
IR (4-6). In addition, previous studies have identified that 
apoptosis in hepatocytes is increased, and a decline in their 
regeneration during hepatic IR injury has been observed (4,7).
The importance of apoptotic cell death in hepatic IR 
has been investigated previously. According to previous 
studies, 40-60% of hepatocytes may undergo apoptosis during 
IR (8-10).
Ischemic preconditioning is a technique in which organs 
are exposed to brief periods of IR in order to prepare an organ 
for the subsequent effects of a longer period of IR exposure.

against myocardial infarction; however, at present, it used in 
various organs, including the brain, intestine, skeletal muscle 
and liver (11). The underlying cytoprotective mechanisms 
remain to be elucidated and may include an increase in the 
adenosine levels in the cell microenvironment, a decrease in 
NO levels, a reduction in TNF-α release, changes in energy 
metabolism and accelerated cell-cycle progression (12).
Previous studies that conducted experimental models 
of partial liver IR injury by 5-15 min of ischemia followed 
by 10 min of reperfusion led to hepatoprotective conditions, as 
a significant reduction in areas of hepatocyte necrosis occurred 
and the increase in transaminase levels was limited (13,14). A 
previous study determined that this narrowed hepatoprotec-
tive time window for ischemia is defined by the relative tissue 
concentrations of adenosine and xanthine (15). Additionally, 
purinergic signaling may have a protective role during hepatic 
IR injury (16).
Adenosine accumulates in the extracellular space following 
ischemia by binding to selective G-protein-associated 
membrane receptors, termed A1, A2A, A2B and A3, and has been 
established to promote cytoprotection. In a model of IR injury 
in mice, adenosine administration was observed to induce a 
protective effect on the liver (17). Additionally, the activation 
of the A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) has been identified to 
exert cardioprotection, neuroprotection and pulmonoprotec-
tion against IR injury (18-22).
Upon activation of the A3AR, specific signal transduc-
tion pathways are modulated, including the Wnt and NF-κB 
signaling pathways (23,24). The activation of A3AR in 
inflammatory cells and tissues may lead to deregulation 
of the NF-κB signaling pathway and may result in reduced 
expression levels of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein 
kinase B/Akt (PKB/Akt), IκB kinase, IκB and NF-κB, resulting 
in an anti‑inflammatory effect (24‑26). Additionally, apoptosis 
of inflammatory cells was observed downstream of PKB/Akt 
modulation, leading to upregulation of caspase 3 expression 
levels (27).
It is of note that activation of the A3AR resulted in increased 
differentiation of tumor cells compared with normal cells (28). 
CF102, a selective agonist to A3AR, induced the differentiation 
of normal and tumor cells and inhibited their proliferation, 
along with the induction of apoptosis in inflammatory cells, 
whereas it had a protective effect on normal cells (29).
Based on the aforementioned previous studies, the present 
study aimed to determine the ability of CF102 to protect the 
liver against IR injury.
Materials and methods
Reagents. The A3AR agonist, CF102, a compound also 
termed 2-chloro-N6-(3-iodobenzyl)-adenosine-5'-N-methy
l-uronamide (Cl-IB-MECA),was synthesized for Can-Fite 
BioPharma (Petah Tikva, Israel) by Albany Molecular 
Research, Inc. (Albany, NY, USA). A stock solution of 5 mg/ml 
was prepared in dimethylsulphoxide and further diluted in 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
Animals. Animal handling was conducted according 
to the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health 
(Bethesda, MD, USA) and the Association for Assessment 
and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (Frederick, 
MD, USA).
Male Wistar rats (n=76; age, 10 weeks; Harlan 
Laboratories, Inc., Jerusalem, Israel) were used in the present 
study. The body weights of the rats ranged from 275 to 300 g. 
The animals were provided with a nutritionally balanced 
rodent diet and water ad libitum. They were maintained under 
constant environmental conditions, temperatures range was 
18‑24˚C and relative humidity range was 30‑70% with 12 h 
light and 12 h dark cycle. The present study was performed 
following approval by the Can-Fite Biopharma, Institutional 
Ethic committee (Petah Tikva, Israel) , and in compliance 
with the Israel Animal Welfare Act, approval nos. 029_a123 
and 029_a128.
IR injury procedure. A total of 28 male Wistar rats (275-300 g) 
were used for the IR injury procedure in the following groups: 
i) Naïve (n=4), laparatomy was performed without IR proce-
dure; ii) control (n=12) no treatment or surgery; and iii) CF102 
(n=12) laparatomy and IR were performed, followed by 
treatment with CF102. Rats were fasted 12 h prior to surgery, 
then anesthetized with ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine 
(10 mg/kg). Laparatomy was performed via a subcostal, 
bilateral incision. The main portal pedicle to the total liver 
was clamped for a period of 30 min, and the blood flow was 
restored by de-clamping. Subsequently, the rats were injected 
subcutaneously with 100 µg/kg CF102 (in 0.1 ml PBS) during 
reperfusion, and the compound was orally administered three 
times per day thereafter. The control rats received normal saline 
of the identical volume. All animals received 5 ml 5% glucose 
and 0.2 ml penicillin subcutaneously immediately following 
the operation. Postoperatively, the animals were maintained 
on a standardized pelleted diet and were supplied with water 
ad libitum. The present study was conducted over the course 
of 48 h.
The rats were anesthetized using isoflurane (Sigma-Aldrich; 
Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) 48 h after the operation, 
2 ml blood samples were collected from the inferior vena cava 
and were centrifuged at 24, 000 x g for 15 min at 25˚C. The 
supernatant was collected and serum aspartate aminotrans-
ferase (SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (SGPT) levels 
were analyzed in the Medical Center Laboratories (Herzelia, 
Israel) to evaluate the extent of liver injury. The rats were sacri-
ficed using CO2 in a gas chamber. The livers were removed and 
fixed in 10% buffered formalin for pathological analysis and 
staining.
Partial hepatectomy. A total of 48 male Wistar rats 
(300-350 g) were used in the present study: The control group 
contained 22 individuals, the CF102 group had 22 and the 
naive group had 4 rats. Rats were fasted 12 h prior to surgery 
and anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine 
(45 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg). Laparatomy was performed 
via a subcostal, bilateral incision. The primary portal pedicle 
to the liver was identified and clamped prior to the hepatec-
tomy procedure. A period of 10 min total liver ischemia was 
initiated, during which a 70% hepatectomy was performed. 
This was achieved by resection of the median and left lateral 
lobes, according to the technique previously described by 
Higgins and Anderson (30). Following 10 min of ischemia and

completion of 70% hepatectomy, blood flow to the remaining 
liver was restored by de-clamping. All animals received 
5 ml 5% glucose and 0.2 ml penicillin subcutaneously imme-
diately following the operation. Postoperatively, the animals 
were maintained on a standardized pelleted diet and were 
supplied with tap-water. Rats were injected subcutaneously 
with 100 µg/kg CF102 (in 0.1 ml PBS) during reperfusion, 
and the compound was administered orally three times per 
day thereafter. The control rats received normal saline at the 
identical volume. At 2, 4 and 48 h after surgery, rats were 
anesthetized with isoflurane and blood samples (2 ml) were 
collected from the rats' tails for analysis of SGOT and SGPT 
levels. Rats were sacrificed using CO2 after 24 and 48 h, and 
the liver tissues were resected and weighed in order to calcu-
late the hepatic regeneration rate, with subsequent fixing in 
10% buffered formalin for further pathological analysis and 
staining.
Immunohistochemical staining and histology. Liver tissue 
specimens were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin 
and cut into 5 mm thick sections.
Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed in order 
to obtain a mitotic index (MI) by dividing the number of cells 
undergoing mitosis by the total cell number in 30 high-power 
fields. Additionally, the presence of hepatic injury and necrosis 
was also observed.
Apoptosis was examined by observation of DNA frag-
mentation using the ApopTag Peroxidase in Situ Detection 
kit (Chemicon; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) for a 
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling 
(TUNEL) assay following the manufacturer's protocol. Next, 
the sections were deparaffinized, re‑hydrated and endogenous 
peroxidase was quenched with 20% hydrogen peroxidase 
in methanol for 20 min. The slides were then pretreated 
with proteinase K (BioVision, Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA) for 
15 min at room temperature, and treated with an equilibra-
tion buffer for 10 s and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase 
enzyme (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck Millipore) for 1 h. Sections 
were incubated with an anti-digoxigenin conjugated antibody 
(cat. no. ab119345; 1:1,000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), washed 
with PBS and developed with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine, counter-
stained with hematoxylin and eosin and then mounted.
To calculate the proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) 
labeling index, 5 mm sections were incubated with anti-PCNA 
antibody (cat. no. ab29; 1:1,000; Abcam). The proliferation 
of hepatocytes was calculated as the number of cells in the 
S-phase. PCNA-positive cells exhibited brownish-yellow or 
yellow nuclei. If brown particles were observed in the nucleus, 
the cells were considered to be positive.
Hepatic regeneration rate. The growth of residual liver lobes 
was assessed using the following equation: Hepatic regen-
eration rate (%) = C-(A-B) / A x100, where A is the estimated 
total liver weight prior to the hepatectomy (A was considered 
to be 3.4% of a rat's total weight) (31), B is the weight of the 
resected liver during the hepatectomy and C is the weight of 
the regenerated liver at the final resection (32).
Statistical analysis. The results were evaluated using Student's 
t-test. Comparisons between the mean values of the different 
experiments were performed. Data are presented as the 
mean ± standard deviation. P<0.05 was considered to indicate 
a statistically significant difference.
Results
CF102 attenuates liver IR injury in rats. In the present study, 
rats were exposed to 30 min of ischemia. The serum levels of 
SGOT and SGPT, which may be used as a proxy of the extent 
of liver damage, were significantly reduced in the CF102 treat-
ment group when compared with the control group 48 h after 
surgery (P<0.05;Fig. 1).
Pathological analyses were performed in order to 
obtain additional qualitative assessment of liver injury. 
Paraffin-embedded slides of liver tissues were stained by 
hematoxylin and eosin 48 h after liver reperfusion. The upper 
panel of Fig. 2 shows healthy hepatocytes and no signs of 
necrosis or inflammation in the naïve group, whereas large 
areas of necrosis surrounded by numerous inflammatory cells 
and pyknotic nuclei were observed in liver tissues from the 
control group (middle panel). By contrast, liver tissues from 
the CF102-treated group did not exhibit areas of necrosis, 
and only a few inflammatory cells were visible (lower panel). 
These findings confirm that the A3AR agonist, CF102, allowed 
for substantial protection against IR injury from occurring 
(Fig. 2).
CF102 protects against IR injury in hepatectomized rats. 
Liver hepatectomy was performed on 70% of the rat's liver, 
whilst being exposed to 10 min of ischemia. Liver enzymic 
analysis revealed a marked increase in the levels of SGOT 
and SGPT 2 h after the hepatectomy, which peaked at 4 h 
and started to decrease after 48 h in the control group. CF102 
treatment applied following reperfusion induced a reduction 
in the levels of SGOT and SGPT, which was maintained for 
48 h (Fig. 3).

treatment increased the regeneration rate of the remnant 
liver by 45% at 48 h following the 70% hepatectomy (Fig. 4). 
Additionally, in the CF102 treatment group, the PCNA 
labeling index (Fig. 5) and the MI (P=0.013; Fig. 6) were 
higher compared with the saline-treated control group.
Discussion
The present study determined that the selective A3AR agonist, 
CF102, when administered during liver reperfusion, may 
attenuate cellular injury, apoptosis and the extent of necrosis 
in liver subjected to IR. Additionally, CF102 stimulated liver 
regeneration, which favored the survival of hepatocytes during 
IR injury. A rat model combining 70% partial hepatectomy

with 10 min of Pringle maneuver was used, in order to 
imitate the surgical procedure performed in humans. In this 
model, 30% of the liver remained, which was exposed to IR 
injury. Following partial hepatectomy and liver reperfusion, 
serum levels of SGOT and SGPT, which may be used as a 
proxy of liver damage, were reduced in the CF102 treatment 
group when compared with the control group at 2, 4, and 48 h 
after the hepatectomy. Reduced liver necrosis and cell apop-
tosis were observed in the remaining liver obtained from the 
CF102-treated rats 48 h after the operation when compared 
with the control group. It is of note that the remnant liver 
in the CF102-treated rats exhibited a 45% increase in the 
hepatic regeneration rate when compared with the untreated 
control group rats. This was confirmed, as the MI and the 
PCNA labeling index were higher in the CF102 treatment 
group compared with the control (Figs. 5 and 6). Therefore, 
CF102, a highly selective A3AR agonist with high receptor 
affinity, may be able to protect against liver IR injury at low 
concentrations. Previous studies have extensively reported that 
A3AR may be used as a target to mediate different protective 
functions, including neuroprotection, chemoprotection and 
cardioprotection (21,33,34). Auchampach et al (33) revealed 
that IB-MECA (CF102), administered at a concentration 
of 100 µg/kg intravenously 5 min prior to the onset of reper-
fusion, reduced the size of myocardial infarct in dogs (33). 
Similarly, 2-CL-IB-MECA administered during reperfusion 
reduced infarct size in isolated rat hearts and prevented apop-
tosis in isolated rat cardiomyocytes (35). The PI3K-PKB/Akt 
signal transduction pathway was identified to be responsible for 
IB-MECA-induced glycogen synthase kinase-3b inactivation, 
which is considered to be involved in cardioprotection (15).
Inhibition of the apoptotic response to IR injury in the lungs by 
the activation of A3AR has also been previously described (36). 
Rivo et al (36) have established a spontaneously breathing cat 
model where the administration of IB-MECA (300 µg/kg) 
during reperfusion markedly attenuated indices of injury and 
apoptosis (36). Adenosine has been established as a regulator 
of cell viability (37), and A3AR has been specifically identified 
to contribute to the modulation of cell survival. Activation of 
A3AR may induce cell protection or death, depending on the 
degree of receptor activation (37,38).
Activation of the A3AR has also been described to trigger 
neuroprotection. Chen et al (21) have determined that, when A3R 
knockout mice are treated with a high dose of CL-IB-MECA 
(0.2 mg/kg), reduced cerebral infarction through the activation 
of A3AR and suppression of apoptosis occurred (21).
Apoptosis has been implicated in the pathophysiology of IR 
liver injury (39); however, an association with A3AR activation 
remains to be described.

The present study determined that treatment with CF102 
accelerated liver regeneration following a 70% hepatectomy 
and IR injury. Zhang et al (40) have determined that, in a 
regenerative state, the liver was protective against carbon 
tetrachloride-induced hepatotoxicity via a mechanism 
involving increased mitochondrial respiratory activity and 
plasma membrane fluidity (40).
Our previous study determined that activation of A3AR 
initiates a molecular mechanism that involves the deregula-
tion of the PI3K-NF-κB signaling pathway, which results in 
an effective anti‑inflammatory effect (26). Therefore, this may 
be the possible mechanism through which CF102 exerts its 
hepatoprotection against IR injury, as the late phase of IR liver 
injury involved an inflammatory process.
In conclusion, the ability of CF102, an A3AR agonist, to 
protect against hepatic IR injury, may include an anti‑inflam-
matory and an anti-apoptotic effect, combined with an 
increased rate of liver regeneration. However, further studies 
should be conducted in order to elucidate the molecular basis 
for these clinically important effects of CF102.
