IMPORTANCE Interventions based on behavioral science might reduce inappropriate
antibiotic prescribing.
OBJECTIVE To assess effects of behavioral interventions and rates of inappropriate (not
guideline-concordant) antibiotic prescribing during ambulatory visits for acute respiratory
tract infections.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cluster randomized clinical trial conducted among 47
primary care practices in Boston and Los Angeles. Participants were 248 enrolled clinicians
randomized to receive 0, 1, 2, or 3 interventions for 18 months. All clinicians received
education on antibiotic prescribing guidelines on enrollment. Interventions began between
November 1, 2011, and October 1, 2012. Follow-up for the latest-starting sites ended on April 1,
2014. Adult patients with comorbidities and concomitant infections were excluded.
INTERVENTIONS Three behavioral interventions, implemented alone or in combination:
suggested alternatives presented electronic order sets suggesting nonantibiotic treatments;
accountable justification prompted clinicians to enter free-text justifications for prescribing
antibiotics into patients’ electronic health records; peer comparison sent emails to clinicians
that compared their antibiotic prescribing rates with those of “top performers” (those with
the lowest inappropriate prescribing rates).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Antibiotic prescribing rates for visits with
antibiotic-inappropriate diagnoses (nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections, acute
bronchitis, and influenza) from 18 months preintervention to 18 months afterward, adjusting
each intervention’s effects for co-occurring interventions and preintervention trends, with
random effects for practices and clinicians.
RESULTS There were 14 753 visits (mean patient age, 47 years; 69% women) for
antibiotic-inappropriate acute respiratory tract infections during the baseline period and 16 959
visits (mean patient age, 48 years; 67% women) during the intervention period. Mean
antibiotic prescribing rates decreased from 24.1% at intervention start to 13.1% at intervention
month 18 (absolute difference, −11.0%) for control practices; from 22.1% to 6.1% (absolute
difference, −16.0%) for suggested alternatives (difference in differences, −5.0% [95% CI, −7.8%
to 0.1%]; P = .66 for differences in trajectories); from 23.2% to 5.2% (absolute difference,
−18.1%) for accountable justification (difference in differences, −7.0% [95% CI, −9.1% to −2.9%];
P < .001); and from 19.9% to 3.7% (absolute difference, −16.3%) for peer comparison
(difference in differences, −5.2% [95% CI, −6.9% to −1.6%]; P < .001). There were no
statistically significant interactions (neither synergy nor interference) between interventions.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among primary care practices, the use of accountable
justification and peer comparison as behavioral interventions resulted in lower rates of
inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory tract infections.

O
veruse of antibiotics exposes patients to unneces-
sary risk of adverse drug events, increases health care
costs, and increases the prevalence of antibiotic-
resistant bacteria.1,2 Most antibiotics prescribed in the United
States are for acute respiratory tract infections, and roughly
half of these prescriptions are intended to treat diagnoses for
which antibiotics have no benefit.3,4 Despite published clini-
cal guidelines and decades of efforts to change prescribing pat-
terns, antibiotic overuse persists.1,2,5,6 Interventions such as
physician and patient education, computerized clinical deci-
sion support, and financial incentives have historically pro-
duced modest reductions in antibiotic prescription rates for
targeted acute respiratory tract infections.7,8
Changing clinician decision making has been challenging
in acute respiratory visits and other care domains. For ex-
ample, pay-for-performance has yielded mixed results,9,10 and
traditional alerts and reminders, which can contribute to in-
formation overload, are often disruptive and ignored.11 Two
recent studies favored an intervention that did not disrupt
workflow and that appealed to clinicians’pride in their own
performance.12,13 With this in mind, there is increasing inter-
est in use of behavioral science, including psychology and be-
havioral economics, to affect policy.14 Researchers are begin-
ning to apply models from these disciplines to identify new
social and cognitive devices to gently nudge clinician deci-
sion making while preserving freedom of choice.15 Such ap-
proaches are well matched to the goal of encouraging uptake
of effective evidence-based treatments in health care, with
appropriate antibiotic prescribing being one example.
We applied insights from behavioral science to design 3 in-
terventions to reduce the rate of unnecessary antibiotic pre-
scribing during ambulatory visits for acute respiratory tract
infections in a multisite cluster randomized trial.
Methods
Study Design
Details of the study design, randomization scheme, and in-
terventions are summarized below and presented in detail in
the original protocol (available in Supplement 1). The institu-
tional review board of each participating institution ap-
proved all study procedures and waived informed consent for
patients.
Settings
We recruited 49 primary care practices from 3 health systems
using 3 different electronic health records (EHRs) in 2 geo-
graphically distinct regions: Massachusetts (Partners Health-
Care: 22 practices affiliated with Brigham and Women’
s Hos-
pital or Massachusetts General Hospital) and Southern
California (AltaMed Medical Group, 22 practices; The Chil-
dren’
s Clinic, 5 practices [the latter also sees a high volume of
adult patients]). Participating practices served different pa-
tientpopulations.ThemajorityofpatientsattheSouthernCali-
fornia practices were Hispanic, with a high proportion living
at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, whereas the pa-
tients served by the Massachusetts practices were predomi-
nantly white/non-Hispanic, with a wider income range. Race/
ethnicity was assessed as part of the standard collection of
demographic data from EHRs, and harmonized using Obser-
vational Medical Outcomes Partnership standards for race/
ethnicity reporting.16
Practices were excluded prior to randomization if none of
their clinicians had at least 5 antibiotic-inappropriate acute re-
spiratory tract infection visits annually. Two of the practices
did not meet inclusion criteria, leaving 47 practices for ran-
domization. All sites required clinicians to prescribe medica-
tions through their EHRs.
Enrollment
Clinicianswererecruitedviaemailandenrolledthroughanon-
line education module covering acute respiratory tract infec-
tiondiagnosisandtreatmentguidelines,informationaboutthe
interventions, and any expected changes to their EHRs
(details in the original protocol, available in Supplement 1); cli-
nicians provided electronic informed consent at module
completion. Some organizations allowed payment to indi-
vidual clinicians for their participation; others instead re-
quested payment to practices. Payment for study participa-
tion was $1200 per clinician, regardless of intervention
assignment or antibiotic prescribing rates.
Outcome Measures
The primary study outcome was the antibiotic prescribing rate
for antibiotic-inappropriate acute respiratory tract infection
visits and no concomitant reason for antibiotic prescribing.
Antibiotic-inappropriate diagnoses included nonspecific up-
per respiratory tract infections, acute bronchitis, and influ-
enza (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision
[ICD-9] codes 460, 464, 464.0, 464.00, 464.1, 464.10, 464.2,
464.20, 464.4, 464.50, 465, 465.0, 465.8, 465.9, 466, 466.0,
466.1, 466.11, 466.19, 487, 487.1, 487.8, 490). We excluded vis-
its with diagnosis codes for acute pharyngitis or acute rhino-
sinusitis because guidelines permit antibiotic prescription
when certain criteria are met, and we lacked data necessary
to identify this antibiotic-appropriate subset.17,18
Avisitforanantibiotic-inappropriateacuterespiratorytract
infection was eligible for outcome inclusion if (1) the patient
was 18 years or older, (2) the clinician and practice were en-
rolled in the study, (3) the visit occurred during the 18-month
baseline or 18-month intervention period, and (4) the patient
hadnovisitforacuterespiratorytractinfectionwithintheprior
30 days. Visits were excluded when patients had medical co-
morbidities that were acute respiratory tract infection guide-
line exclusions (eg, chronic lung disease; for full list of ex-
cluded diagnoses, see original protocol [Appendix E: Code Set
Definitions] in Supplement 1) or patients had concomitant visit
diagnoses indicating presence of other, potentially antibiotic-
appropriate, infections (eg, cellulitis, acute sinusitis).

Partnership Common Data Model, version 3).16
Interventions
Suggested alternatives was an EHR-based intervention most
closely resembling traditional clinical decision supports and
order sets. Diagnoses of acute respiratory tract infection trig-
gered a pop-up screen stating that “Antibiotics are not gener-
ally indicated for [this diagnosis]. Please consider the follow-
ing prescriptions, treatments, and materials to help your
patient,” followed by a list of alternatives (see original proto-
col [Appendix F: Example of Suggested Alternatives Order Set]
in Supplement 1), each with streamlined order entry options
for over-the-counter and prescription medications (eg, decon-
gestants) and letter templates excusing patients from work.
The suggested alternatives intervention drew from the behav-
ioral insight that prescribers may infer that a suggested
(nonantibiotic) alternative ought to be considered, thus re-
ducing the likelihood that an antibiotic would be prescribed.19
Accountable justification was also an EHR-based interven-
tion. An EHR prompt asked each clinician seeking to prescribe
an antibiotic to explicitly justify, in a free text response, his or
her treatment decision. The prompt also informed clinicians
that this written justification would be visible in the patient’
s
medical record as an “antibiotic justification note” and that if
nojustificationwasentered,thephrase“nojustificationgiven”
would appear. Encounters could not be closed without the cli-
nician’
s acknowledgment of the prompt, but clinicians could
canceltheantibioticordertoavoidcreatingajustificationnote,
if they chose. The accountable justification alert was trig-
gered for both antibiotic-inappropriate diagnoses and poten-
tially antibiotic-appropriate acute respiratory tract infection
diagnoses (eg, acute pharyngitis).
The accountable justification intervention was based on
prior findings that accountability improves decision making
accuracy and that public justification engenders reputational
concerns.20-23 To preserve their reputations, clinicians should
be more likely to act in line with injunctive norms24—that
is, what one “ought to do” as recommended by clinical
guidelines.25
Peer comparison was an email-based intervention. Clini-
cians were ranked from highest to lowest inappropriate pre-
scribingratewithineachregionusingEHRdata.Clinicianswith
the lowest inappropriate prescribing rates (the top-
performingdecile)weretoldviamonthlyemailtheywere“Top
Performers” (see original protocol [Appendix G: Sample Peer
Comparison Email Text] in Supplement 1). The remaining cli-
nicians were told that they were “Not a Top Performer” in an
email that included the number and proportion of antibiotic
prescriptions they wrote for antibiotic-inappropriate acute re-
spiratory tract infections, compared with the proportion writ-
ten by top performers.
Peer comparison was distinct from traditional audit-and-
feedback interventions in its comparison with top-performing
peers instead of average-performing peers and its delivery of
positive reinforcement to top performers—a strategy shown
elsewhere to sustain performance.26-28
Intervention Triggers
The suggested alternatives and accountable justification in-
terventions were triggered by clinician entry of antibiotic or-
ders for antibiotic-inappropriate acute respiratory tract infec-
tions and those for which antibiotics were potentially (but not
necessarily) appropriate: acute rhinosinusitis and acute phar-
yngitis. The peer comparison intervention included only an-
tibiotic-inappropriate acute respiratory tract infections. All
3 interventions were suppressed for patients who had comor-
bidities constituting guideline exclusions.
Randomization
We randomized practices to receive 0, 1, 2, or 3 interventions
in a 2 ×2 × 2 factorial design to avoid within-practice contami-
nation between clinicians, blocking on geographic region (in
part, to balance study allocation by EHR) to achieve balance for
evaluation of main effects.29 This factorial design enabled in-
vestigation of potential interactions between intervention ef-
fects, while preserving the ability to estimate the main effects
ofeachinterventionindividually.Randomizationprogramming
was conducted with the R statistical programming package
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing; https://www
.r-project.org/foundation/).
Implementation
Dates for intervention implementation differed between prac-
tice organizations, owing to differences in clinician recruit-
ment procedures and EHR-specific development times for in-
tervention features. Interventions began between November
2011 and October 2012 and lasted for 18 months in each prac-
tice. For the latest-starting practices, follow-up ended on April
1, 2014. A study timeline is presented in the eFigure in
Supplement 2.
Statistical Analysis
Our primary analysis was based on the approach of Gerber et
al12: we used a piecewise hierarchical model with a knot at
month 0 (the intervention start date) to model trajectories of
thelogoddsofthemainoutcomeforthecontrolgroupandeach
intervention group, starting 18 months before each interven-
tionbeganandendingafter18monthsofinterventionexposure,
and including random effects for practices and clinicians. The
estimatesofinterestwereintervention × timeinteractionterms,
which represented changes in prescribing trajectories, relative
to contemporaneous controls, that occurred when each inter-
vention began. This model measured the effects of each inter-
ventionincomparisonwithallpracticesthatdidnotreceivethe

practice-andclinician-leveleffectstoaccountfortime-invariant
characteristics (eg, specific EHR product used). We did not
adjust for patient characteristics, which were measured after
clinicians were exposed to the interventions and could be con-
comitant with outcome. Instead, we relied on block random-
ization to equate groups on patient characteristics.

differences between control and intervention (ie, for inter-
vention effects) were bootstrapped with 1000 replications.
We performed sensitivity analyses to test for interactions
between interventions by expanding the main effects model
to include interaction terms for each combination of interven-
tions and comparing this fully interacted model to the origi-
nal main model using a Wald test.30 We also evaluated inter-
action terms individually using a similar approach.
With an expected 2252 or more visits per intervention
group, a priori calculations indicated 80% power to detect a
7% absolute reduction in antibiotic prescribing (less than the
8.9% median effect in prior efforts to improve antibiotic qual-
ity improvement)8 at the .05 level of significance, assuming a
baseline prescribing rate of 50% and intrapractice correlation
coefficient of 0.05. These expected visit counts and correla-
tioncoefficientswerebasedonpreinterventionanalyses,using
data from the Boston and Los Angeles sites.
To investigate the possibility that interventions led to di-
agnosis shifting (ie, changes in clinicians’diagnostic coding
habits), we used the approach of our main models to test
whether potentially antibiotic-appropriate acute respiratory
tract infection diagnoses (eg, pneumonia, chronic sinusitis) in-
creased as a proportion of all acute respiratory tract infection
diagnoses.31
In sensitivity analyses, we fit a simple difference-in-
differences model estimating changes in the primary out-
come associated with each intervention, treating the entire
18-month intervention period as a binary variable, without
accounting for prescribing trajectories.
Elements of our analytic approach (specifically, using an
18-month baseline period and piecewise hierarchical model-
ing technique in the main analyses, performing the interac-
tion effect sensitivity analysis, and performing the simple dif-
ference-in-differences model sensitivity analyses) were
modified from our original analysis plan based on feedback
received during the peer review process.
Under the direction of an independent data and safety
monitoring board, we evaluated patient safety. For antibiotic-
inappropriate visits in which no antibiotic was prescribed, we
assessed return visits within 30 days for the presence of
complications potentially attributable to untreated bacterial
infections (eTable 1 in Supplement 2). We conducted chart re-
views on a 20% random sample of such cases to determine
whetherprescriptionofantibioticsattheinitialvisitwouldhave
prevented the complication.
We performed a complete case analysis. There were no
missing values of the main outcome, and we did not impute
missing covariate values (which were missing in approxi-
mately 3% of records). We analyzed data using Stata MP ver-
sion 12.1 (StataCorp) and considered 2-sided P values less than
.05 significant.
Results
Sample Characteristics
Of 353 clinicians invited, 248 (70%) agreed to participate
(Figure 1). On average, enrolled clinicians were 48 years old,
and most were women (Table 1). Among patients who had a
qualifying visit during the 18-month intervention period, the
mean age was 48 years, 33% were men, 87% were white, 32%
were Hispanic, and 59% had private insurance (patient char-
acteristics during the baseline period are available in eTable 2
in Supplement 2).
During the study, there were 125 333 visits for any diagno-
sis of acute respiratory tract infection. Of these, 31 712 visits
(14 753 during baseline period, 16 959 during intervention
period) met criteria for outcome evaluation.
Antibiotic Prescribing
Mean antibiotic prescribing rates decreased from 24.1% at in-
terventionstartto13.1%atinterventionmonth18(absolutedif-
ference, −11.0%) for control practices; from 22.1% to 6.1% (ab-
solutedifference,−16.0%)forsuggestedalternatives(difference
in differences, −5.0% [95% CI, −7.8% to 0.1%]; P = .66 for dif-
ferences in trajectories); from 23.2% to 5.2% (absolute differ-
ence, −18.1%) for accountable justification (difference in dif-
ferences, −7.0% [95% CI, 9.1% to −2.9%]; P < .001); and from
19.9% to 3.7% (absolute difference, −16.3%) for peer compari-
son (difference in differences, −5.2% [95% CI, −6.9% to −1.6%];
P < .001) (Figure 2; full regression results available in eTable
3 in Supplement 2).
There were no statistically significant interactions be-
tween interventions, and the fully interacted model failed to
improve goodness-of-fit over the main effects model (eTable
4A and 4B in Supplement 2). The results of sensitivity analy-
ses treating the entire 18-month baseline and intervention pe-
riodsasdummyvariables(eTable5inSupplement2)weresimi-
lar to the main analysis (Figure 2; eTable 3 in Supplement 2).
Unadjusted qualifying visit counts and prescribing rates be-
fore and during the intervention for each study group are avail-
able in Table 2.
Diagnosis Shifting
Relative to control, none of the interventions was statistically
significantly associated with changes over time in the propor-
tion of antibiotic-appropriate acute respiratory tract infection
diagnoses among visits for any acute respiratory tract infec-
tion diagnosis (ie, there was no evidence of diagnosis shifting;
full regression results available in eTable 6 in Supplement 2).
Safety
The rate of return visits for possible bacterial infections within
30 days following visits for acute respiratory tract infection
(both antibiotic-inappropriate and potentially antibiotic-
appropriate) in which antibiotics were not prescribed was
0.43%(95%CI,0.25%to0.70%)amongcontrolpractices.There
was a statistically significantly higher rate of such return vis-
its in the accountable justification plus peer comparison group
(1.41% [95% CI, 1.06% to 1.85%]) (eTable 7 in Supplement 2).
No other intervention group (including the group applying all
3 interventions simultaneously) had a statistically signifi-
cantly higher rate of such return visits.
Among return visits, study physicians and an indepen-
dent data safety and monitoring board reviewed a random
sample of 33 cases across all study groups. For 12 cases, it

was unlikely that an antibiotic would have been helpful if
prescribed at the index visit (eg, “cold symptoms” with clear
chest and no fever at return visit); for 8 cases, there was
uncertainty (eg, patient returned with a diagnosis of pneu-
monia, but no chest radiograph was obtained at the index or
return visit); and for 13 cases, antibiotics might have been
helpful (eg, a patient with influenza diagnosis at initial visit
was hospitalized for pneumonia 1 week later; return-visit
diagnoses associated with these 13 cases are available in
eTable 8 in Supplement 2).
Discussion
We designed, implemented, and evaluated 3 behavioral inter-
ventions to curtail overuse of antibiotics for acute respiratory
tract infections. We found that 2 socially motivated interven-
tions—accountable justification and peer comparison—
resulted in statistically significant reductions in inappropri-
ate antibiotic prescribing, while suggested alternatives, which
lacked a social component, had no statistically significant

effect. There were no statistically significant interactions be-
tween interventions; therefore, applying these interventions
simultaneously might have additive effects on antibiotic
prescribing.
The intervention effects that we observed represent re-
ductions in inappropriate prescribing beyond those attribut-
able to an educational module or observation alone (the Haw-
thorne effect), which were both applied in the control
condition. We believe these effect sizes (5.2 to 7.0 percentage
points) are clinically significant, especially when measured
against control clinicians who were motivated to join a trial,
knew they were being monitored, and who had relatively low
antibiotic prescribing rates at baseline.32-34
Insights from behavioral science may have enhanced the
effectiveness of interventions. Our peer comparison interven-
tion performed favorably in comparison with traditional
audit-and-feedback.35 Previous studies have shown modest
effects36 or null effects37 when justification interventions
lacked public accountability (ie, lacked mechanisms to pub-
licly display clinicians’written justifications). In contrast, our
justification intervention included such a mechanism: the
“antibiotic justification note.”

All3interventionsinvolvedmodestchangestothepractice
environment (ie, “nudges”); none restricted clinicians’choice
oftreatmentorchangedhowclinicianswerepaid.Forsomepri-
mary care practices, the peer comparison intervention might
bethesimplestandmostpragmaticoftheseinterventions,since
it requires no modification of the EHR. However, the peer com-
parison intervention depends on producing valid performance
measures, which can be challenging when data are unavailable
or individual-clinician sample sizes are small. The accountable
justification intervention, although it requires EHR modifica-
tion, does not have these drawbacks and can, in theory, be ap-
plied to any clinical decision (since clinicians should always be
able to articulate a decision-making rationale).
Therewaslittleevidenceofpotentialharmassociatedwith
any of the 3 interventions. Although the study group apply-
ing both the accountable justification and peer comparison in-
terventions had a modestly higher rate of return visits for di-
agnoses of concern (approximately 1.4% of visits, compared
with 0.4% in the control group), no other intervention group
(including the group applying all 3 interventions simultane-
ously) was associated with higher rates of such return visits.
We did not assess potential harms associated with prescrib-
ing antibiotics unnecessarily; such harms are most likely when
inappropriate prescribing rates are highest (ie, when no inter-
vention is applied). However, as with other efforts to change
clinical practice, continual monitoring of patient outcomes is
advisable.
Our study has limitations. First, the number of clinicians
within each cluster was small. Although a high proportion of
invitedclinicianschosetoparticipate,somedidnot,whichmay
limit generalizability. Similarly, trial findings might not gen-
eralize to primary care practices dissimilar to those enrolled.
Second, results are dependent on EHR and billing data, which
are imperfect for performance measurement—although in the
present context they have demonstrated validity.38
Third,logisticandothernonlinearregressionmethodsmay
lead to effect sizes biased toward the null in randomized stud-
ieswhenimportantcovariatesareomitted.39,40Fourth,although
interactions were not significant, combining nudges in some
cases could have attenuated the effects we observed (eg, if pre-
scribing rates hit a “floor”). Therefore, our results might under-
estimatetheindependenteffectsofeachindividualintervention.
Fifth, our safety analyses were limited to return visits to
the clinical organizations studied (possibly underestimating
interventionrisks)anddidnotinvestigateharmscausedbyun-
necessary antibiotics (possibly underestimating risks of not
applying the interventions). Sixth, we did not distinguish
between narrower- and broader-spectrum antibiotics.
Seventh, we did not measure heterogeneity of interven-
tion effects by type of practice, clinician, or EHR product.
Eighth, we could not directly measure differences in clini-
cians’coding habits between types of practice settings. Ninth,
persistence of effects is unknown. Last, elements of our ana-
lytic approach were determined post hoc, based on guidance
during the peer review process. Effect estimates from these
post hoc analyses had the same direction and statistical
significance as our prespecified analyses.
Conclusions
Among primary care practices, the use of accountable justifi-
cation and peer comparison as behavioral interventions re-
sulted in lower rates of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for
acute respiratory tract infections.
