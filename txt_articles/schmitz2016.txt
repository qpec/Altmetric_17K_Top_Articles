The aim of the present study was to evaluate the interaction between depressive symptoms and metabolic dysregulations as risk
factors for type 2 diabetes. The sample comprised of 2525 adults who participated in a baseline and a follow-up assessment over a
4.5-year period in the Emotional Health and Wellbeing Study (EMHS) in Quebec, Canada. A two-way stratified sampling design was
used, on the basis of the presence of depressive symptoms and metabolic dysregulation (obesity, elevated blood sugar, high blood
pressure, high levels of triglycerides and decreased high-density lipoprotein). A total of 87 (3.5%) individuals developed diabetes.
Participants with both depressive symptoms and metabolic dysregulation had the highest risk of diabetes (adjusted odds
ratio = 6.61, 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.86–9.01), compared with those without depressive symptoms and metabolic
dysregulation (reference group). The risk of diabetes in individuals with depressive symptoms and without metabolic dysregulation
did not differ from the reference group (adjusted odds ratio = 1.28, 95% CI: 0.81–2.03), whereas the adjusted odds ratio for those
with metabolic dysregulation and without depressive symptoms was 4.40 (95% CI: 3.42–5.67). The Synergy Index (SI = 1.52; 95% CI:
1.07–2.17) suggested that the combined effect of depressive symptoms and metabolic dysregulation was greater than the sum of
individual effects. An interaction between depression and metabolic dysregulation was also suggested by a structural equation
model. Our study highlights the interaction between depressive symptoms and metabolic dysregulation as a risk factor for type 2
diabetes. Early identification, monitoring and a comprehensive management approach of both conditions might be an important
diabetes prevention strategy.

INTRODUCTION
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a progressive chronic disease that is
increasing at epidemic rates. A recent study found that the
prevalence of diabetes worldwide has increased by 45% between
1990 and 2013.1 Mental health problems often co-occur in people
with type 2 diabetes.2 Notably, three meta-analyses suggest that
the risk of incident diabetes is 37–60% greater for individuals
with depressive symptoms than individuals without depressive
symptoms.3–5 The mechanisms linking depression and type
2 diabetes are not well understood though it is likely that
behavioral and biological factors contribute to this association. For
example, various lifestyle-related behaviors such as smoking,
physical inactivity and poor diet are associated with depression
and can contribute to the development of prediabetes and type
2 diabetes.6 Indeed, health behaviors are important components
of various diabetes risk scores.7–10
Metabolic dysregulation, often described by the clustering of
three or more metabolic traits such as high triglycerides, low high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol, high blood pressure, abdominal
obesity and impaired glucose regulation, has been used as a
method of identifying individuals at an increased risk of type
2 diabetes.11
Depression accompanied by metabolic dysregulations has been
identified as a subtype of depression12,13 and has been labeled
‘metabolic depression’.14,15 It is possible that individuals with
comorbid metabolic dysregulations and depression might be at
particular risk of developing type 2 diabetes. For example, these
individuals have more problems with lifestyle modifications16
(motivation
and
adherence)
than
people
with
metabolic
dysregulations only, or they may have more biological and
metabolic risk factors than individuals with depression only.
Although depression and metabolic factors have each been
demonstrated to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, the extent to
which the combination of these factors (that is, metabolic
depression) increases risk of type 2 diabetes is unknown. Using
data from a community sample of adults aged 40–69 years
without diabetes at baseline, our aim was to identify the
association between depressive symptoms, metabolic dysregula-
tions and type 2 diabetes over 4.5 years while controlling for other
non-metabolic diabetes risk factors (family history of diabetes,
sociodemographic characteristics and lifestyle-related behaviors).
We hypothesized that individuals with both depressive symptoms
and metabolic dysregulations at baseline would have a higher risk

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Design/setting and participants
The Emotional Health and Wellbeing Study (EMHS) is a follow-up of 2525
adults who participated in the CARTaGENE (CaG) study in the province of
Quebec, Canada. A detailed description of the CaG study is provided
elsewhere.17 Briefly, CaG recruited 20 004 participants aged 40–69 years
from four metropolitan areas between July 2009 and October 2010 and
detailed health, lifestyle and sociodemographic information, physiological
measures and biological samples were collected.
A stratified subsample of CaG participants who: agreed to be contacted for
a follow-up study, did not have diabetes at baseline and had information on
depressive symptoms were contacted and invited to participate in the EMHS
4–5 years after the baseline assessment. A two-way stratification approach
based on the presence of depressive symptoms and metabolic dysregulation
was used. Depressive symptoms were defined as having a Patient Health
Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 summary score of 6 and higher,18 which includes mild,
moderate and severe depressive symptoms. Classification for metabolic
dysregulation was based on current definitions of the metabolic syndrome,
and was defined as three or more metabolic risk factors,19 including: elevated
blood pressure (4130/85 mm Hg or use of anti-hypertensive medication),
impaired glycemic control (HbA1c between 5.7 and 6.5%), low high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (o1.03 mmol l− 1 in men and o1.30 mmol l− 1 in
women), elevated triglycerides (41.7 mmol l − 1) and central obesity (waist
circumference⩾102 cm (men), ⩾88 cm (women)). EMHS participants were
recruited from the four groups (a) neither no/mild depressive symptoms nor
metabolic dysregulation (n = 9491 in CAG database) (reference group); (b)
metabolic dysregulation without depressive symptoms (n =5193 in CAG
database);
(c)
depressive symptoms
without
metabolic
dysregulation
(n =1635 in CAG database); and (d) presence of both depressive symptoms
and metabolic dysregulation (n =1179 in CAG database). All participants in
groups (c) and (d) and random samples of groups (a) and (b) were invited to
participate. A detailed description of the sampling is provided in Figure 1.
Potential participants were initially contacted by email and followed up
by mail and phone by the CaG group. They were informed about the aims
of the EMHS study and provided informed consent (written or electronic
consent on a secure website) if they were interested in being contacted by
EMHS investigators for a follow-up interview. Participants who agreed to
be contacted by the EMHS team were contacted via telephone between
October 2014 and March 2015 by trained interviewers. All participants
received a detailed explanation of the study and were asked for verbal
informed consent. The Douglas Mental Health University Institute Ethics
Board (EMHS investigators) and the St Justine Hospital Research Ethics
Board (CaG investigators) approved the consent procedures and the study
protocol.
Measures
Self-reported diabetes was the central outcome variable. It was measured
with the self-report question, ‘In the past 5 years, has a doctor told you that
you have diabetes?’. Additional information on diabetes was collected,
including date of onset, current diabetes treatment (oral medication,
insulin treatment and diet) and tests for HbA1c levels. This information was
used to validate self-reported diabetes onset.
Depressive symptoms were measured with the PHQ-9 at baseline.
Individuals were asked to what extent they had experienced each of nine
depressive symptoms over the past two weeks. Possible responses range
from ‘not at all (0)’ to ‘on nearly every day (3)’. A summary score was
computed from the nine individual items, with higher scores indicating
greater depression symptom severity. Reliability and validity of the PHQ-9
have indicated that it has sound psychometric properties.18
Diagnostic assessments of 12-month and lifetime major depression
disorder were conducted at follow-up using the computerized World
Mental Health—Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) 2.1,20
a standardized instrument for the assessment of mental disorders
according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Fourth Edition, Text Revision21 criteria. The lifetime version of the CIDI
collects information on age at the most recent episode and age at first
onset. Age at first onset was used to determine whether an episode of
depression had occurred before or after baseline assessment.
Physical activity at baseline was measured using the International
Physical Activity Questionnaire, an instrument which has shown to have
good
test-retest
reliability
and
moderate
convergent
validity
with
accelerometers.22 Energy expenditure, measured as Metabolic Equivalent,
was estimated.23 Smoking status at baseline was assessed by two
questions: ‘Do you currently smoke cigarettes?’ and ‘In your lifetime have
you smoked a total of 100 cigarettes or more?’. Smoking was categorized
into three groups (current smoker, former smoker and never smoker).
Participants were asked how many servings of vegetables (fresh, frozen,
canned or cooked) and fruit they eat on a typical day (serving was defined
as ½ cup or 125 ml). A binary diet variable was defined as consuming five
or more servings of fruits and vegetables daily.24
Medication
intake
was
assessed
during
the
baseline
interview.
Antidepressant medications were identified from the list of medications.
The CARTaGENE baseline survey collected data on sociodemographic
characteristics. Education was categorized into three categories (less than
high
school,
high
school,
and
college/graduate
studies/university).
Ethnicity was classified into white vs non-white. Family history of diabetes
was assessed by asking questions about parents' and siblings' histories of
diabetes.
Analyses
In the first step, we used the PHQ-9 for the assessment of depressive
symptoms and compared diabetes incidence for the four groups described
above. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the adjusted odds
ratios and 95% confidence intervals of diabetes incidence for those with
(i) neither no/mild depressive symptoms nor metabolic dysregulation
(reference group); (ii) metabolic dysregulation without depressive symptoms;
(iii) depressive symptoms without metabolic dysregulation; and (iv)
presence of both depressive symptoms and metabolic dysregulation.
Adjustment was made for age, sex, education, ethnicity, family history of
diabetes, smoking, diet and physical activity. All covariates were measured
at baseline. We generated multiple imputed values for the missing data
from the variables used in the analysis (PROC MI and PROC MIANALYSE in
SAS 9.3). To account for the stratified sampling, we determined sampling
weights, defined as 1/sampling fraction, for each depression/metabolic
dysregulation group and incorporated them into the analyses.
Interaction between depressive symptoms and metabolic dysregulation
was assessed as departure from additive risks and quantified using

 Rothman’s Synergy Index.25 The Synergy Index is calculated as the ratio
between combined effect and individual effects: ORAB − 1/[ORAb − 1]
+[ORaB − 1] where AB is the presence of both depressive symptoms and
metabolic dysregulation, Ab is the presence of depressive symptoms only
and aB is the presence of metabolic dysregulation. A value greater than
1 implies synergism (departure from additive risks).25
In the second step, we used structural equation modeling26 to
determine the joint associations of depression and metabolic risk factors
on diabetes incidence. Structural equation models are an extension of
regression analysis that can handle measurement error and a wider range
of
relationships
among
variables.
Both
depression
and
metabolic
dysregulation were modeled as latent variables. Those latent variables
summarize the information measured with the observed variables and
account for measurement error and the individual contribution of each
measure.26
Antidepressant
medication,
PHQ-9
summary
score
and
depression history (based on CIDI interview) at baseline were used as
indicators for depression. Elevated blood pressure, impaired glycemic
control, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, elevated triglycerides and
central obesity were used as indicators for the latent variable metabolic
dysregulation. Diabetes incidence was entered as a manifest variable. We
controlled for the same baseline variables as in our logistic regression
analyses. We first specified a model without interaction between
depression and metabolic dysregulation, followed by a model that
included
an
interaction
term
between
the
two
latent
variables
(multiplicative interaction). Models were compared for fit using the Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC) and the Sample-Size Adjusted Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC) and a Wald test was used for model
comparison.27 Parameters were estimated using a maximum likelihood
estimation, including estimating a random effect and maximum likelihood
estimator with robust standard errors. The estimated path coefficients from
the latent variables to the diabetes incidence variable can be interpreted
as odds ratios. Analyses were conducted with MPlus (Version 7.3).28

the
follow-up
assessment. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of
participants in our cohort and the original CARTaGENE cohort
were similar, although EMHS participants had a somewhat higher
educational level. Results are presented in Table 1. Mean follow-up
time was 4.6 years (s.d. = 0.30). The mean age at baseline was 53.9
(s.d. = 7.5) years and the proportion of women was 57.4%. Baseline
characteristics are presented in Table 2.
There were 760 (30.1%) participants in group a (no/mild
depressive symptoms and no metabolic dysregulation) (reference

 (depressive symptoms without metabolic dysregulation); and 436
(17.3%) participants in group d (presence of both depressive
symptoms and metabolic dysregulation). Participants with metabolic
dysregulation and depressive symptoms (group d) had a higher
waist circumference (Po0.001) but did not have a worse metabolic
dysregulation (diastolic blood pressure, HbA1c levels, high-density
lipoprotein levels and triglyceride levels) than participants with
metabolic dysregulation without depressive symptoms (group b).
A total of 87 (3.5%) individuals developed diabetes between
the baseline assessment and the follow-up assessment. Diabetes
incidence in the four groups was 0.9%, 4.6%, 1.5% and 8.5%,
respectively.
Table 2 shows results that were obtained from unadjusted and
adjusted logistic regression analyses. Those without depression
and without metabolic dysregulation at baseline were defined as
the reference category. Metabolic dysregulation without depres-
sive symptoms was associated with an increased risk for diabetes
incidence in both unadjusted (odds ratio = 5.23) and adjusted
(odds ratio = 4.40) models. Depressive symptoms without meta-
bolic dysregulation were no longer significantly associated with
diabetes incidence when controlling for other diabetes risk factors.
Participants with both depressive symptoms and metabolic
dysregulation had the highest risk for diabetes incidence. The
Synergy Index for the adjusted model was 1.52 (95% confidence
interval: 1.07–2.17), suggesting that the combined effect of
depressive symptoms and metabolic dysregulation is greater than
the sum of the individual effects.
In sensitivity analyses, we excluded participants with high waist
circumference (top percentile of the empirical distribution: ⩾ 120 cm
(men) and ⩾ 108 cm (women)) to ensure comparable waist
circumference for those with metabolic dysregulation and depres-
sive symptoms (that is, group d) and those with metabolic
dysregulation without depressive symptoms (that is, group b). This
did not provide substantially different results from our main analyses
(data not shown) (Table 3).
The structural equation model containing the interaction
between
the
latent
variables
representing
depression
and
metabolic dysregulation had better fit than the model without
the interaction. The Wald tests also indicated better fit for the
model with interaction (Po0.05). The structural equation model
with the latent variables interaction and corresponding path
coefficients and odds ratios is presented in Figure 2.
For the measurement portion of the model, when setting
impaired
glycemic
control
as
the
reference,
all
metabolic
indicators were significant for the latent variable metabolic
dysregulation. When setting antidepressant medication as the
reference, both depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) and major depres-
sion history (CIDI interview) were significant for the latent variable
depression. Path coefficients between the latent variable and the
indicators can be interpreted as regression coefficients. For the
structural equation model, there was a significant depression-
metabolic
dysregulation
association
(odds
ratio = 1.59,
95%
confidence interval: 1.05–2.41) and a significant main effect for
metabolic dysregulation but not for depression.
DISCUSSION
In this prospective community study of 2525 individuals aged
40–69 years without type 2 diabetes at baseline, we evaluated
the impact of depression and metabolic dysregulations on type 2
diabetes incidence over approximately 4.5 years. The results
suggest an interaction between these two factors in relation to an
increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Logistic regression analyses
suggested that individuals with both depressive symptoms and
metabolic dysregulations at baseline were at higher risk for
developing diabetes than participants with either one of the
conditions only. The combined effect of the two conditions
appeared to be more than the sum of the individual effects, as
suggested by the Synergy Index (additive interaction). It has been
emphasized that measuring effects on the additive scale is most
appropriate for prevention and for assessing the public health
relevance of an exposure, as the additive scale indicates whether
the effect of a risk factor would be greater in one subpopulation
than in another.29 Departure from additivity is also used to study
biological interaction, which is defined as two causes acting in the
same sufficient-component model to cause disease.30
A multiplicative interaction between depression and metabolic
dysregulation was also suggested by a structural equation model
in which depression was defined based on a clinical interview, a
symptom scale and antidepressant medication. The structural
equation model takes measurement error into account and allows
a more flexible modeling.

 To our knowledge, this is the first prospective community study
designed to estimate the joint effect of depression and metabolic
dysregulations on incident type 2 diabetes in individuals aged
40–69 years.
The main strengths of the study are the prospective design, the
availability of metabolic factors at baseline, a clinical interview for
the assessment of depression history and the stratified sampling.
Strengths of the analysis include a structural equation modeling
approach. This method has several advantages: (i) depression
and metabolic dysregulation were modeled as continuous latent
constructs
rather
than
categorized
summary
scores,
which
reduces potential misclassification associated with cutoff points
for binary or categorical variables; (ii) we assumed that latent
constructs were measured with measurement error; that is,
depression and metabolic dysregulation were not assumed to
be perfectly measured by the indicators; (iii) different indicators
for the two latent constructs had different weights (estimated
coefficients in Figure 2); and (iv) all parameters were estimated
simultaneously in one model. The structural equation approach
permitted consideration of a depression construct that is more
general than depressive symptoms in the past 2 weeks, as
measured by the PHQ-9; we modeled depression as a latent
variable where current depressive symptoms, antidepressant
medication and major depression history based on a structured
diagnostic interview were included as indicators for the depres-
sion construct.
We acknowledge several study limitations. Diabetes incidence
was based on self-reports and not on clinical measures. Individuals
with undiagnosed diabetes were not identified. There is the
possibility that some individuals with undiagnosed diabetes might
have
higher
levels
of
depressive
symptoms.
Nonetheless,
evidence from clinical and population-based studies suggests
that self-reported diabetes is a robust exposure measure31,32
and, in general, a sufficiently accurate measure of diabetes in
epidemiologic studies.33 Depressive symptoms at baseline were
assessed using a brief self-report scale that measures depressive
symptoms experienced in the past 2 weeks and does not account
for history and treatment of depression. A clinical interview for
depression (history) was conducted at follow-up assessment only
and might be subject to recall bias. In addition, lifestyle-related
behaviors such as smoking, diet and physical activity were
assessed by self-report, which may be subjected to reporting

 bias. We cannot exclude the possibility that selection bias might
have affected the strength of the association. Awadalla et al.17
found an overall concordance in the distribution of sociodemo-
graphic characteristics between the CaG cohort and the general
population, although CaG participants were generally more
educated. Furthermore, those people who took part in the CaG
study were likely healthier than the overall cohort owing to the
restrictions placed upon eligibility for blood assessments. Finally,
as in all observational studies, there could be unmeasured
confounding by unknown or unmeasured predictors.
There are several ways in which depression or depressive
symptoms may be associated with an increased risk of developing
type 2 diabetes. Metabolic factors might have a key role in this
association.
Metabolic
dysregulations
are
important
and
well-established risk factors for diabetes and require a variety of
self-management behaviors to optimize treatment. The management
of metabolic dysregulations often includes increasing physical
activity, changing one’s diet and smoking cessation. Depression
has been shown to adversely impact these self-management
behaviors,16 which might worsen the management of metabolic
factors. In addition, depression has been shown to be associated
with poor adherence to medication.34 It is likely that depressive
symptoms and metabolic dysregulations interact with each other
in a dynamic way: depressive symptoms can impede people from
managing their metabolic conditions as effectively as they need
to, which can lead to more metabolic problems, which, in turn, can
result in more depressive symptoms.35
Metabolic dysregulations and depression also share common
pathophysiologic mechanisms36 and the co-occurrence of both
conditions might amplify the risk of developing diabetes. Depres-
sion is associated with sympathetic nervous system activation and
dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis,37
which are associated with metabolic changes through abdominal
fat accumulation, glucose metabolism and blood pressure regula-
tion. Some antidepressant medications can cause weight gain and
obesity38 and are associated with an increased risk of diabetes.38
Increased levels of inflammatory cytokines (for example, C-reactive
protein and interleukin 6)39 are also associated with both metabolic
dysregulation and depression. Depression and metabolic dysregula-
tion might stimulate each other’s occurrence, which can in turn
result in several metabolic dysregulations. This can lead to a vicious
cycle that further aggravates depression and metabolic outcomes.14
For example, Vogelzangs et al.40 have shown that metabolic
dysregulations predicted a more chronic course of depressive
disorders. Recurrent or chronic depressive symptoms are associated
with prolonged exposure to psychosocial and normal life stress,
which can wear and tear different circulatory, inflammatory,
immune and psychological regulatory systems41,42 and increase
allostatic load (the price the body pays for being forced to adapt to
adverse psychosocial or physical situations).41
Depression is a heterogeneous condition. Data-driven techni-
ques have confirmed that depression can generally be divided
into several subtypes.43 Lamers et al.44 identified three depressive
subtypes within a cohort of subjects with depression using latent
class analysis (severe melancholic class, 46%; severe atypical class,
25% and moderate severity, 29%). The severe atypical class was
associated with more metabolic dysregulations, suggesting that
that this subtype involves a metabolic component. Depression
subtypes with metabolic components have also been reported by
others.12,45
Although many studies and meta-analyses have shown that
depression is associated with increased diabetes incidence,
depression alone might not be the focal point of the problem,
but
rather
the
combination
of
depression
with
metabolic
dysregulations. It might be crucial for a better understanding of
depression as a risk factor for diabetes and for future prevention
interventions to identify and focus on homogeneous depression
phenotypes that take biological correlates into account.
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, our study conducted in a community sample
highlights the interaction between depressive symptoms and
metabolic dysregulation as a potentially important risk factor for
type 2 diabetes. Early identification, monitoring and a compre-
hensive management approach of both conditions might be an
important diabetes prevention strategy.
