The threat of antimicrobial resistance in
developing countries: causes and control
strategies
James A. Ayukekbong1,4*, Michel Ntemgwa2 and Andrew N. Atabe3
Abstract
The causes of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in developing countries are complex and may be rooted in practices
of health care professionals and patients’ behavior towards the use of antimicrobials as well as supply chains of
antimicrobials in the population. Some of these factors may include inappropriate prescription practices, inadequate
patient education, limited diagnostic facilities, unauthorized sale of antimicrobials, lack of appropriate functioning drug
regulatory mechanisms, and non-human use of antimicrobials such as in animal production. Considering that these
factors in developing countries may vary from those in developed countries, intervention efforts in developing
countries need to address the context and focus on the root causes specific to this part of the world. Here,
we describe these health-seeking behaviors that lead to the threat of AMR and healthcare practices that drive
the development of AMR in developing countries and we discuss alternatives for disease prevention as well
as other treatment options worth exploring.
Keywords: Antimicrobial therapy, Developing countries, Microorganisms, Resistance
Background
The threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is growing at
an alarming rate and the situation is perhaps aggravated in
developing countries due to gross abuse in the use of anti-
microbials [1]. It is well known that any use of antimicro-
bials however appropriate and justified, contributes to the
development of resistance, but widespread unnecessary
and excessive use makes the situation worse [2]. Misuse of
antimicrobials is facilitated in developing countries by their
availability over the counter, without prescription and
through unregulated supply chains [1, 3]. Non-compliance
in the use of antimicrobials has many repercussions upon
resistance and poverty is a major root factor of antimicro-
bial misuse in developing countries [4]. On the other hand,
even among the rich, some patients miss doses either by
mistake or deliberate, especially in cases where signs and
symptoms begin to subside after an initial favorable the-
rapeutic response [5]. In other situations, such as in the
event of an acute side effect, patients abandon their
treatment, only to return to the hospital with a recurring
infection by a more virulent and resistant strain of the mi-
crobe [6]. These actions result in the exposure of surviving
pathogens to sub-therapeutic concentrations of antimicro-
bials thus increasing the chances of acquiring resistance.
Self-medication is a common practice in developing coun-
tries where patients often get antimicrobials without
prescription and through unregulated supply chains [7]. To
make the situation even worst, some patients seek their
first-line of treatment from traditional healers who provide
them with herbal combinations for the treatment of infec-
tions. These substances of unknown composition and
potency may enhance pathogen fitness and contribute to
the development of resistance. Antimicrobial resistance
often occur through the inhibition of specific antimicrobial
pathways such as cell wall synthesis, nucleic acid synthesis,
ribosome function, protein synthesis, folate metabolism,
and cell membrane function [8–10].
Causes of antimicrobial resistance
To better appreciate the causes of AMR, we need to
understand the various sequential steps involved for a

 drug to get to a patient and the eventual use, which
include; production, distribution, prescription, dispen-
sing, and finally consumption of the drug by the patient
or use in animal production [11]. Consequently, any
imprudent practice along this flow may result in the
emergence of resistance.
Drug dispensers and drug quality
The lack of appropriate regulations in the sales of antimi-
crobials is also a driving factor in the access and misuse of
antimicrobials. In most developing countries, antimicro-
bials can be purchased without medical prescription [12]
and are usually dispensed on the streets by untrained
persons. These drug vendors will sell medications just to
make a sale and accommodate patients’ ability to pay [13].
Even pharmacies operating without a license, appear to be
more accessible to the public as they have shorter waiting
time, do not charge consultation fees and above all are
willing to negotiate treatment options to adjust to the
financial ability of the patients [14]. Retail pharmacies in
developing countries especially in Africa have emerged as
the primary level of outpatient care rendering unauthorized
services from consultation, diagnosis, prescription and
dispensing of medication [14, 15].
It has also been shown that many antimicrobials
dispensed in Africa are of questionable pharmaco-
logical quality [16, 17]. Adverse climatic conditions
such as high ambient temperatures and humidity may
affect the overall quality of the antimicrobials during
storage [18, 19]. Poor storage also increases the risk
of degradation of the drug. Degraded medicines con-
tain less than stated dose, implying that patients con-
sume less than optimal dose of the drug. There is
also a problem of outright counterfeit, in which the
drug may contain little or no active substance of the
antimicrobial or the wrong substance [20]. The influx
of counterfeit and sub-standard antimicrobials into the
pharmaceutical markets in some regions is a major
problem as these preparations of reduced potency also
result in pathogens being exposed to sub-therapeutic
concentrations
of
the
drug
[21].
A
study
from
Cameroon
revealed
that,
out
of
284
antimalarial
obtained from 132 vendors, 32% of chloroquine, 10%
quinine,
and
13%
sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine
were
likely to be fake [16]. In addition, some of the quinine
contained chloroquine while some chloroquine con-
tained no active ingredient or an amount lower than
the expected concentration.
Health professionals
Health care providers play an essential role in the
treatment
and
prevention
of
diseases,
but
may
jeopardize this if their practices are not evidence-based
(Table 1). For example, the prescription practices of
antimicrobials vary among physicians in most coun-
tries. In some cases, the antimicrobial prescriptions are
inappropriate (i.e., wrong drug, wrong doses, or anti-
microbial not necessary at all) [22]. Due to the high
patient-doctor ratio in most developing countries, doc-
tors are overwhelmed and there is often inadequate
time for meaningful education and communication
with the patient on drug adherence guidelines and con-
sequences of poor or non-adherence to these guide-
lines. Treatment sometimes consists of administering
broad-spectrum antibiotics without a definitive diag-
nosis and indication for antimicrobial treatment. In a
Lebanese study, it was shown that in 52% of cases, the
prescription dose was inappropriate while 63.7% of
physicians prescribed antibiotics with wrong duration
of treatment [23].
Due to lack of effective and reliable surveillance sys-
tems and poor dissemination of research information,
health professionals in developing countries sometimes

 lack up to date information on the AMR pattern within
their populations. In tertiary hospitals with advanced
capacities, physicians rely mostly on the resistance or
susceptibility pattern of the pathogen isolated from a
patient. Health personnel in rural settings without the
capacity to do AMR testing have difficulty to decide on
the choice of antimicrobial in the absence of an anti-
microbial sensitivity test. As a result, health professionals
use more and more broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat
infections caused by several bacteria species or those for
which establishing the etiology is difficult or takes a long
time. This practice contributes to the development of
resistance [24] as the drug applies selective pressure, not
only upon the etiological agent of the disease episode
but also upon a large fraction of the patient’s microbiota
[25]. Some health professionals issue prescriptions that
are not evidence-based and rely on a syndromic ap-
proach to both infections in the community as well as
hospitalized patients. That is treatment is based on easily
recognized signs and symptoms (syndromes) as well as
to microorganism most commonly responsible for each
of these syndromes. This practice is on the rise due to
the lack of legal consequences of wrongful prescription
of antibiotics. Our preliminary findings in Cameroon
revealed that a significant number of physicians are
likely to prescribe antibiotics to treat diarrhea caused by
rotavirus, due to the lack of capacity to establish the
diagnosis (Unpublished). Due to fear of bad treatment
outcomes of critical diseases, some physicians may
resort to blind prescription of multiple and broad-
spectrum antimicrobials. Meanwhile, because of finan-
cial incentives from drug suppliers, some physicians are
prone to prescribing multiple antibiotics for the same
condition [26].
Patients
As mentioned earlier, compliance is a major contributor
to the development of AMR [27]. Patients miss doses,
either by mistake or deliberate. Because patients are
aware of the adverse impact of drinking alcohol while on
antibiotics, some patients may skip doses when invited
for a party in favor for the consumption of alcohol (unpub-
lished data). These practices result in exposure of surviving
microbes to sub-therapeutic concentrations of the drug
and, consequently increases the chances of developing
resistance [25]. Because of poverty, many sick individuals
in developing countries of Africa often seek their first-line
of treatment from traditional healers who provide them
with herbal mixtures of unknown efficacy for the treatment
of infections. Some combine antibiotics with their herbal
mixtures simultaneously while others take antimicrobials
and supplement them with herbal mixtures purportedly to
improve efficacy [12]. These compounds of unknown
potency may enhance pathogen fitness.
Non-human use of antimicrobials
Antimicrobials are used to prevent (prophylaxis in high
risk animals) and treat diseases in animals, as well as
used as growth promoters in animal breeding [28, 29].
Additionally, they are used as additives in plant agricul-
ture (fruits, vegetables, and orchid, etc.), especially in the
spraying of fruit trees for disease prophylaxis and the ap-
plication of antibiotic-containing manure on farmland
and in industrial processes [30]. The use of antimicrobial
agents in animals and more importantly food-producing
animals has important consequences for both human
and animal health as it can lead to the development of
resistant bacteria (Table 1). These resistant bacteria (with
resistance genes) in animals can be transferred to
humans through the consumption of food or through
direct contact with food-producing animals or through
environmental spread (e.g. human sewage and runoff
water from agricultural sites). The use of antimicrobial
drugs in health care, agriculture or industrial settings,
exerts a selection pressure which can favor the survival
of resistant strains (or genes) over susceptible ones,
leading to a relative increase in resistant bacteria within
microbial communities [31]. It is now known that in-
creased AMR in bacteria affecting humans and animals
is primarily influenced by an increase in the use of
antimicrobials for a variety of purposes, including thera-
peutic and non-therapeutic purposes in animal produc-
tion [32]. A strong association between agricultural use
of antimicrobials and the development of resistance has
been suggested [33], and it has been shown that the bulk
of antimicrobials used worldwide are not consumed by
humans but rather are given to animals for the purposes
of food production [34].
Multidrug resistant bacteria have been detected in
both meat and fresh produce [35] and in humans in con-
tact with livestock in many African countries [36–38]. A
study in Kenya revealed a high level of antimicrobial
drug residues in meat meant for consumption [34].
These findings further demonstrate that food animals
are a major reservoir of drug resistant bacteria and
present a major risk for dissemination and transmission
of antimicrobial resistant bacteria in Africa as well as
many developing countries. A large proportion of the
population in developing countries live in close proxim-
ity with animals, thus increasing the chances of trans-
mission of resistant microorganisms from animals to
humans through animal handling [39, 40]. In a recent
study in rural Bangladesh animal healthcare providers
responded they more often sought animal health care
from pharmacies and village doctors, citing the latter
two as less costly and more successful based on past per-
formance [41]. In the absence of an effective animal
healthcare system, villagers depend on informal health-
care providers for treatment of their animals. This may

 lead to suboptimal use of antimicrobials in such settings
with unhygienic animal husbandry practices. In terms of
aquaculture, heavy use of prophylactic antibiotics in
aquaculture has been reported in developing countries
and is a growing problem for human and animal health
and for the environment [42].
Overall, limiting the routine use of in-feed antibiotics
will improve human and animal health, by reducing the
development and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
Therefore, judicious use of antibiotics in healthcare and
agricultural settings is essential to slow the emergence of
resistance and extend the useful lifetime of effective anti-
biotics that are in existence today.
In other to minimize the risk of AMR due to non-human
use of antimicrobials especially in animal production, in-
formation resources in developing countries need to be
strengthened to support health professionals, patients,
animal keepers and the public, so that the society can have
a better understanding of the value and importance of
antimicrobials, especially antibiotics. Taken together, the
excessive use of antimicrobials in animals and agriculture
and the associated public health consequences justifies the
importance of limiting the inappropriate use of antimicro-
bials in both agriculture and the veterinary sector.
Inadequate surveillance and limited laboratory
antimicrobial susceptibility testing
The availability of routine antimicrobial susceptibility
testing to provide information on resistance trends, in-
cluding emerging resistance is very essential for routine
clinical practice and for the development of effective
policies against AMR. Antimicrobial susceptibility tes-
ting is not often performed in most rural laboratories
due to lack of capacity. In the absence of patient-specific
antimicrobial
susceptibility
testing,
community-based
antimicrobial surveillance data may be very useful to
health care professionals in particular communities or
regions to treat infections with specific susceptible anti-
microbials. Such surveillance needs to be conducted
regularly and continuously because resistance rates can
vary in one region of a country over time.
Antimicrobial resistance control strategies
The problem of AMR is aggravated by the fact that most
world pharmaceutical companies consider research for
new antimicrobials as being of “low profit” and some
speculate that resistance will eventually develop for new
antimicrobials anyway. Consequently, they prefer to in-
vest in the development of drugs for chronic diseases
(diabetes, hypertension) as well as those used to improve
lifestyle (e.g., Cialis, Viagra, etc.) [43]. Therefore, the
long-term solution should be focused on methods to
prevent the emergence of resistance or the spread of re-
sistant organisms from one person to another.
Hygiene and sanitation
Apart from the irrational use of antimicrobials, unique
environmental conditions such as crowding and poor
sanitation also contribute in the circulation and spread
of resistant microorganisms. Transmission of resistant
pathogens is facilitated by person-person contact, through
contaminated water, food or by vectors. Improving basic
hygiene and sanitation will reduce the spread of resistant
organisms (Table 2) [44]. Improving infection prevention
and control in hospitals will reduce the nosocomial spread
of bacteria with acquired resistance such as Staphylococcus
aureus amongst others.
Vaccination
While antimicrobials are used for treatment, vaccines
are a primary mode of prevention of infectious diseases.
Prior vaccination may reduce severity of disease, provide
protection against shedding of pathogens and even raise
the threshold load of pathogens required for infection
[45–47]. Also, indirect population protection of some
vaccines as a result of herd immunity in unvaccinated
individuals represents additional advantage of vacci-
nation. In most regions of the world, a number of diseases
such as smallpox, measles, mumps rubella, diphtheria,
hepatitis A, pertussis, and polio have been prevented by
vaccination [48].
However, even with the most effective vaccine, the
need of antimicrobials or alternative treatment options
will still in some cases be solicited. For example, in the
case of genetic drift, escape mutants and serotype or strain
replacement diseases, vaccination may fail to confer full
protection from disease. For bacterial infections, the intro-
duction of conjugate vaccines for example Streptococcus

 pneumoniae, has reduced the outbreak of respiratory
infections in children in developing countries [49].
Alternative therapies
The increase in microbial resistance to traditional antimi-
crobials and the reluctance of pharmaceutical companies
to invest in research and development of novel antimicro-
bial agents necessitate the exploration of alternative the-
rapies. Future focus of medical therapeutics and research
is to look beyond antibiotics [43], and search for alterna-
tives which can regulate the microbial virulence as well as
growth inhibition. There are currently a couple of other
alternatives approaches at different levels of research and
development.
1. The use of bacteriophage is emerging as an alternative
treatment option for bacteria infections [50]. Many
authors have suggested that bacteriophage therapy is
a necessary alternative to conventional antibiotics
[51, 52]. Bacteriophages are bacterial viruses with
the capacity to invade bacterial cells and induce
lysis of the bacteria (lytic cycle). In the present
era of multidrug resistant bacteria and reluctance
in the development of new antibiotics by
pharmaceutical companies, the need to
aggressively explore the possibility of phage
therapy is unprecedented.
2. Quorum Sensing inhibitors represents an important
antimicrobial target that may prevent, suppress, and/
or treat infectious diseases. The mechanistic details
(including auto-inducers) of Quorum Sensing are
different between Gram-negative and Gram-positive
bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria utilize N-acyl L-
homoserine lactones (AHLs), which are homoserine
lactone (HSL) rings with an additional fatty acid side
chain while Gram positive bacteria uses oligopeptides
[53–55]. While antibiotics kill or slow down the growth
of bacteria, quorum sensing inhibitors or quorum
quenchers simply attenuate bacterial virulence. A
large body of work on Quorum Sensing has been
carried out in deadly pathogens like Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio fischeri,
Vibrio. harveyi, Escherichia coli and Vibrio. cholerae
etc. A number of these studies have succeeded in
exploiting the bacterial Quorum Sensing system as
potential target for treatment of bacterial infections.
The inhibition of Quorum Sensing system is
believed to be advantageous over conventional
antibiotics, because only the communication
mechanism between the bacteria is disrupted
without killing the individual cells. Hence, this
strategy should generate a lower selective pressure
and reduce the rate at which AMR develops during
the treatment [55].
3. Probiotics, otherwise referred to as fecal transplant
therapy (FTT) is a treatment option that has been
employed for decades, albeit with mixed results
[56–58]. FTT is the act of using fecal material from
pathogen-free healthy donors to repopulate the
microbiota of a recipient. Probiotics are considered
to be able to destroy pathogenic microorganisms
by producing antimicrobial compounds such as
bacteriocins and organic acids, improve gastrointestinal
microbial environment by adherence to intestinal
mucosa thereby preventing attachment of pathogens
and competing with pathogens for nutrients, stimulate
the intestinal immune responses and improve the
digestion and absorption of nutrients. The commonly
used probiotics include Bacillus, Lactobacillus,
Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Pediococcus,
Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Pseudomonas, yeast,
Aspergillus, and Trichoderma, etc.
This treatment option is an old practice, used many
years ago, especially in China and had been successfully
used to treat Clostridium difficile infections as well as
other enteric diseases [56, 59, 60].
Taken together, the application of these alternate thera-
pies is not limited to developing countries and most are
still under development or at different stages of clinical
trial and their routine availability will require govern-
mental approval and subvention in developing countries.
The role of stakeholders in the control of antimicrobial
resistance
The control of AMR cannot be the sole responsibility
of medical professionals and scientists. Although con-
tinuing education is essential to enable health care pro-
viders learn the need in rational prescription practices
and the importance of evidence-based prescription [61],
the general population and other stakeholders have a
central role to play [62]. The government of every
country should consider AMR as a public health prio-
rity issue. Policies and regulations should be put in
place to enforce the prudent access and use of antimi-
crobials. The population needs to be educated on the
threat of AMR and therefore media professionals need
to get adequate training on how to convey medical and
scientific information in lay language through multiple
channels to inform the populations on practices that
promote the emergence of AMR organisms [62]. The
benefits of an education program for journalists has
been successful for the fight against HIV/AIDS in many
developing countries and a similar approach for AMR
will likely result to an added benefit [63, 64]. A number
of initiatives have been taken so far by regulatory agen-
cies and governments in the combat of antimicrobial
resistance but most of these initiatives have been done
Ayukekbong et al. Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control  (2017) 6:47 
Page 5 of 8
 only in developed countries [65–68] and are lacking in
resource limited nations [69, 70].
A few African countries have been identified as being
involved in the Global Antibiotic Resistance Partnership
(GARP), established in 2009 to create a platform for
developing actionable policy proposals on antibiotic
resistance in low-income and middle-income countries.
Unfortunately, to date national GARP working groups
are established only in a few African countries [70].
There is therefore need to generate solutions such as to
build a strong African laboratory infrastructure to help
combat AMR which is a global health threat [71]. A
multi-disciplinary approach involving a wide range of
partners is therefore needed to limit the risk of AMR
and minimize its impact on human and animal health
especially in developing countries.
The role of government regulatory agencies
With the new and emergent issue regarding the develo-
pment of AMR, government agencies globally have
engaged in new action plans in order to combat the
AMR issue [72]. However, actions toward this has been
severely lacking in developing countries especially those
in Africa where high quality regulatory agencies are lack-
ing. In May 2015, the WHO endorsed a global action
plan to tackle AMR [73]. In September 2014, the US
government released a ‘National Strategy for Combating
Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria’ that included an executive
order signed by the US president [68]. The action plan
provided several goals and a roadmap to guide the
Nation in rising to this challenge. In 2013, the United
Kingdom released the ‘UK Five Year Antimicrobial
Resistance Strategy (2013 to 2018)’ that sets out actions
to address the key challenges to AMR [67]. Similarly, in
2015, the government of Canada also released the
Federal Action Plan on antimicrobial resistance and use
in Canada (Building on the federal framework for action)
[66]. While many developed countries have developed
such AMR action plans either nationally or at the re-
gional level such as the European Union and Asia-
Pacific region, this is still lacking in many developing
countries especially in Africa [69]. A few African coun-
tries have been identified as being involved in the Global
Antibiotic Resistance Partnership (GARP), established in
2009 to create a platform for developing actionable
policy proposals on antibiotic resistance in low-income
and middle-income countries. However, national GARP
working groups are established only in India, Kenya,
South Africa, Vietnam, Mozambique, Nepal, Tanzania
and Uganda. Moreover, a close look at the national
action plans showed that only one African country
(Ethiopia), was identified by the WHO as having a na-
tional AMR action plan [74] .
What most developing countries especially those in
Africa lack is not the legislation prohibiting the manufac-
ture and distribution of sub-standard drugs but resources
to enforce these policies and to impose penalties to de-
faulters. There is also lack of resources to identify counter-
feit drugs or verify the quality of locally manufactured or
imported drugs [75]. In addition, governments need to
address the sale of antimicrobials without prescription
and illegalize the dispensing of drugs by unauthorized and
unqualified persons. There is also need for the population
to be sensitized on the public health risks of AMR. A
recent WHO survey revealed that while much activity is
underway and many governments are committed to
addressing the AMR problem, there are major gaps in
actions needed across all 6 WHO regions to prevent the
misuse of antibiotics and reduce spread of AMR [69]. Des-
pite these challenges some progress is currently being
made in setting up drug regulatory agencies in Africa. The
effort is supported by the New Partnership for Africa’s
Development (NEPAD) of the African Union and the
WHO. Through the creation of the African Medicines
Regulatory Harmonization (AMRH), it is envisioned that
safe, good quality, efficacious and reasonably priced medi-
cines will be available in Africa [76]. Recently, the African
Society for Laboratory Medicine (ASLM) has engaged in
activities to share research, debate, and generate solutions
to build a strong African laboratory infrastructure to help
combat common global health threats, like AMR as well
as HIV/AIDS, and other medical conditions [71]. There-
fore, a multi-disciplinary approach involving a wide range
of partners is therefore needed to limit the risk of AMR
and minimize its impact on human and animal health
especially in developing countries.
Conclusions
The irrational use of antimicrobials is certainly a
complex
and
multifactorial
problem
in
developing
countries, and a proper understanding of the problem
is necessary for effective control policies. Without ef-
fective
antimicrobials,
diverse
medical
procedures
such as surgery, the care of premature infants, cancer
chemotherapy, care of the critically ill, invasive diag-
nostic and treatment procedures, and transplantation
medicine will be severely hampered with a corre-
sponding increase in morbidity and mortality from
secondary microbial infections. The challenge of glo-
bal antimicrobial resistance is comparable to climate
change and global warming. Therefore, as we seek to
protect the climate for the future generation, it is our
responsibility not to pass over to the next generation,
microbial population that is resistant to antimicrobial
agents that they are supposed to treat as the conse-
quence is likely to be very dangerous.
