In Brief
Bariatric surgery is associated with
enhanced postprandial gut hormone
release, particularly of GLP-1, which
increases insulin secretion and glucose
clearance. Larraufie et al. show that
higher gut hormone levels are due not to
changes in enteroendocrine cell
characteristics or tissue hormone content
but to altered flow of nutrients that
stimulates more distal enteroendocrine
cells.

SUMMARY
Bariatric surgery is widely used to treat obesity and
improves type 2 diabetes beyond expectations
from the degree of weight loss. Elevated post-pran-
dial
concentrations
of
glucagon-like
peptide
1
(GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY), and insulin are widely re-
ported, but the importance of GLP-1 in post-bariatric
physiology remains debated. Here, we show that
GLP-1 is a major driver of insulin secretion after
bariatric surgery, as demonstrated by blocking
GLP-1
receptors
(GLP1Rs)
post-gastrectomy
in
lean humans using Exendin-9 or in mice using an
anti-GLP1R antibody. Transcriptomics and peptido-
mics analyses revealed that human and mouse en-
teroendocrine cells were unaltered post-surgery;
instead, we found that elevated plasma GLP-1 and
PYY correlated with increased nutrient delivery to
the distal gut in mice. We conclude that increased
GLP-1 secretion after bariatric surgery arises from
rapid nutrient delivery to the distal gut and is a key
driver of enhanced insulin secretion.
INTRODUCTION
Bariatric surgery is widely used to treat obesity and is particularly
effective because it results in dramatic improvements in
type 2 diabetes (Sjo
¨ stro
¨ m, 2013). Reduced plasma glucose
after bariatric surgery can be attributed partly to loss of body
weight and adiposity, which in turn improves insulin sensitivity
(Sjo
¨ stro
¨ m, 2013). In addition, bariatric patients have elevated
post-prandial insulin secretion, and there are increasing reports
of bariatric surgery being used to treat type 2 diabetes in patients
who are not severely obese (Pok and Lee, 2014), as well as of
post-prandial
hypoglycemia
occurring
years
after
surgery
when increased insulin release occurs on a background of
improved insulin sensitivity following loss of body weight (Salehi
et al., 2018). Understanding the physiological basis for elevated
post-prandial insulin secretion after bariatric surgery is therefore
important both for preventing hypoglycemia in susceptible post-
surgical populations and for developing new therapeutic strate-
gies to treat type 2 diabetes.
We have studied the endocrinology of lean patients who un-
derwent gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB)
reconstruction for the treatment or prophylaxis of gastric can-
cer (Roberts et al., 2018b). The surgical procedure is similar to
a standard RYGB performed for obesity, with the exception
that the stomach is removed in its entirety. Post-gastrectomy
patients have elevated plasma glucagon-like peptide (GLP) 1,
peptide YY (PYY), and insulin levels after an oral glucose toler-
ance test (OGTT), mirroring the endocrine changes seen in
bariatric patients, but because these patients are not gener-
ally obese, the excessive insulin secretion is associated with
significant
rates
of
post-prandial
hypoglycemia
(Roberts
et al., 2018b). The contribution of GLP-1 to the observed
post-surgical changes in plasma glucose and insulin concen-
trations has been debated, as detailed in several reviews
(Hutch and Sandoval, 2017; Smith et al., 2018). In obese
post-bariatric patients, blocking GLP-1 action using Exen-
din-9 reduced insulin secretion and the incidence of hypogly-
cemia (Jørgensen et al., 2013; Salehi et al., 2014), but corre-
sponding data from mouse models have been conflicting.
Mice
with
global
GLP-1
receptor
(Glp1r)
knockout,
for
example, exhibited similar weight loss and glucose tolerance
to wild-type controls after vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG)
(Wilson-Pe
´ rez et al., 2013), whereas another group reported
that mice with inducible b cell-specific Glp1r knockout had
impaired insulin secretion and higher plasma glucose after
VSG (Garibay et al., 2016).
Why post-prandial GLP-1 and PYY levels are elevated after
bariatric surgery remains incompletely elucidated. GLP-1 and
PYY are produced from enteroendocrine cells (EECs), which
comprise �1% of the intestinal epithelium (Gribble and
Reimann, 2016). These cell types have been extensively char-
acterized in mice, because they can be tagged with fluores-
cent reporters driven by cell-specific hormonal or transcription

 factor promoters in transgenic mouse models (Gribble and
Reimann, 2016), but data on human EECs are limited, because
cell purification requires antibody staining for identification
(Roberts et al., 2018a). One potential explanation for the
post-surgical changes in gut hormone release is that EECs un-
dergo adaptive changes, producing more GLP-1 and PYY that
can be mobilized after food intake, or changing their response
to nutrients due to different receptor expression. Although im-
munostaining of intestinal biopsies from bariatric patients and
obese rodent models does not support the concept that major
shifts occur in the numbers of EECs producing different gut
hormones (Mumphrey et al., 2013; Rhee et al., 2015), staining
methods are semiquantitative at best and do not inform on re-
ceptor expression. However, an important role for intestinal
adaptation was not supported by the finding that GLP-1 levels
after gastric bypass surgery were higher when a liquid meal
was delivered via the oral route than it was when delivered
via the gastroduodenal route on consecutive days (Dirksen
et al., 2010). An alternative explanation is that ingested nutri-
ents make contact with and thereby stimulate more EECs
from the distal gut after surgery, due to anatomic intestinal re-
arrangement and/or increased intestinal transit. In both hu-
mans and mice, GLP-1 and PYY production is higher in
more distal regions of the small intestine (Roberts et al.,
2018a), so increased distal nutrient delivery has the potential
to activate a greater number of GLP-1 and PYY-producing
EECs.
The objectives of this study were to explore the importance
of GLP-1 in post-bariatric physiology and the mechanisms
underlying elevated post-prandial GLP-1 secretion in this group.
Studies were performed in lean human and mouse models to
reduce the confounding effects of metabolic changes due to
loss of body weight and adiposity.
RESULTS
Role of GLP-1 in Driving Hyperinsulinemia in Humans
We hypothesized that elevated plasma GLP-1 levels triggered
by glucose ingestion were responsible for the high insulin secre-
tion rates and subsequent hypoglycemia observed in our lean
human cohort after gastrectomy (Roberts et al., 2018b), as
reported previously in bariatric patients (Craig et al., 2017;
Jørgensen et al., 2013; Salehi et al., 2014). Five post-gastrec-
tomy patients were enrolled into a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled cross-over study, in which they received in-
fusions of the GLP1R antagonist Exendin-9 or placebo on sepa-
rate visits. Forty minutes after starting the infusion, they
consumed a 50 g glucose drink, and 125 min later, they had
an ad libitum test meal. Nadir glucose concentrations after
the OGTT increased significantly from the control to the
Exendin-9 day (Figures 1A and 1B). Elevated insulin concentra-
tions were seen in the control arm and were significantly blunted
by Exendin-9, reaching levels similar to those measured previ-
ously in a non-surgical control group (Roberts et al., 2018b) (Fig-
ures 1C and 1D). The inhibitory effect of Exendin-9 on insulin
release was also observed as a reduced slope of the insulin
secretory rate versus glucose concentration graph (Figure 1E).
Glucagon concentrations 30 min after the OGTT were increased
by Exendin-9 (Figure 1F), consistent with the known inhibitory
effect of GLP-1 on glucagon secretion (Nauck et al., 1993).
GLP-1 concentrations were higher with Exendin-9 (Figure 1G),
consistent with previous reports that GLP-1 inhibits its own
secretion (likely indirectly, e.g., via local somatostatin release)
(Hansen et al., 2000; Heruc et al., 2014; Sze et al., 2011).
Steady-state
Exendin-9
concentrations
(Figure
1H)
were
�0.4 mg/mL (�120 nmol/L), �2-fold above the binding affinity
of Exendin-9 for GLP1R in human insulinoma cells (Waser and
Reubi, 2011). PYY concentrations were higher after Exendin-9
than after placebo (Figure 1I), mirroring the elevated GLP-1
levels and likely reflecting that PYY and GLP-1 are released
from the same EEC type (Billing et al., 2018; Habib et al.,
2013). Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) con-
centrations were reduced by Exendin-9 (Figure 1J), suggesting
that endogenous GLP-1 enhances GIP secretion—a finding
not previously reported. Hunger scores were less suppressed
by glucose ingestion in the Exendin-9 than in the placebo arm,
without corresponding changes in fullness, suggesting that
elevated GLP-1 concentrations contribute to reduced sensa-
tions of hunger in this cohort (Figures 1K and 1L).
Role of GLP-1 in a Murine Lean VSG Model
We established a model of gastrectomy in lean mice, in
which animals had either a VSG or a sham control operation
(McGavigan et al., 2017) (Figure S1). As expected, the VSG
group lost more weight during the first week after surgery
than the sham controls, associated with reduced food intake.
OGTTs triggered higher plasma GLP-1 and insulin levels and
lower glucose excursions in VSG than in sham control groups.
This lean VSG model was used to examine the effect of an
antagonistic
anti-GLP1R
antibody,
providing
long-lasting
blockade of GLP1R (Biggs et al., 2018). Mice were injected
weekly with anti-GLP1R or isotype control antibody for
12 weeks, beginning 1 day before VSG or sham surgery. After
surgery, all groups received 4 weeks of liquid diet, followed
by 4 weeks of high-fat diet (HFD) and then 12 days of the control
low-fat diet (LFD), to assess whether the response to surgery
was diet dependent. Peak and trough antibody titers are shown
in Figure S2A. Weight loss in the post-operative period was
higher in VSG than in sham mice, and liquid food intake was
correspondingly reduced, but no differences were observed
between the control and the active antibody groups (Figures
2A, 2B, 2D, and 2E). When transferred to HFD, by contrast,
the VSG group on anti-GLP1R antibody (Ab) paradoxically ate
significantly more than VSG mice given isotype control and
showed a trend toward additional weight gain (p = 0.08 versus
VSG controls) (Figures 2A, 2B, 2C, and 2F), suggesting that
endogenous GLP-1 suppressed intake of HFD despite having
little effect on ingestion of the liquid diet. OGTTs (1 g/kg) were
performed one day after antibody injection at weeks 2, 4, and
10 after surgery (Figures 2G–2I; Figures S2C–S2K). Post-GTT
plasma glucose concentrations were higher in mice given
GLP1R than control antibody in both sham and VSG groups.
Corresponding 5 min insulin levels were reduced in the anti-
GLP1R-Ab VSG group compared with VSG isotype controls,
whereas the anti-GLP1R antibody did not affect insulin levels
in the sham group.

 Effect of Gastrectomy on the Intestinal Enteroendocrine
Peptidome in Humans and Mice
We investigated whether altered plasma gut hormone profiles
observed after gastrectomy can be explained by changes in pep-
tide biosynthesis in the gut. In lean human gastrectomy patients,
we compared biopsies taken from the jejunum at the time of sur-
gery, with biopsies taken by endoscopy after surgery from the
same anatomic region, just distal to the site of anastomosis with
the esophagus. Biopsies were examined by liquid chromatog-
raphy-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), enabling the
identification and quantification of 22 candidate secretory pep-
tides. Principal-component analysis (PCA) of the samples across
all measured peptides did not differentiate pre- and post-opera-
tive samples (Figure 3A), and no differences were detected
when individual peptides were examined by multi-factorial
ANOVA (Figures 3B and 3C). From the proglucagon peptide, we
detected GLP-1(7-36amide), GLP-2, glicentin-related peptide
(GRPP), and oxyntomodulin (OXM), but not pancreatic-type
glucagon. GLP-1(7-36amide), PYY1-36, and PYY3-36 were not
increased in the post-surgical intestinal biopsies, despite the
raised plasma levels of total immunoreactive GLP-1 and PYY de-
tected after an OGTT in post-gastrectomy patients.

 Because it was not possible to examine other regions of the
post-surgical human gut, we performed a similar study in mice
after VSG or sham surgery. Samples were taken from the stom-
ach to the rectum and analyzed by LC-MS/MS, as they were for
the human jejunum. By PCA, we observed longitudinal gradients
in hormone production in both sham and VSG mice but no sub-
stantial differences between the surgical groups (Figures 3D and
3E). The similarity between sham and VSG samples was also
evident at the level of individual peptide profiles (Figures 3F–3K).
In the cohort of VSG and sham mice treated with GLP1R or
control antibodies, we performed a similar LC-MS/MS analysis
of pancreatic homogenates at the end of the protocol (samples
taken �7 min after an Ensure gavage meal, as described later).
Pancreatic levels of peptides derived from insulin, GCG, IAPP
(islet amyloid polypeptide), PPY (pancreatic polypeptide), and
PYY were similar across all groups; from the proglucagon pep-
tide, we detected glucagon, GRPP, OXM, and GLP-1(1-37),
but not GLP-1(7-37) or GLP-1(7-36amide) (Figures S3G–S3I).
Effect of Gastrectomy on the EEC Transcriptome in
Humans and Mice
We next investigated whether the increased plasma GLP-1 and
PYY levels after surgery were associated with transcriptomic ad-
aptations in intestinal EECs, which could potentially change their
responsiveness to food ingestion. In humans, we fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS)-purified EECs from the jejunum of
peri-operative patients (collected during gastrectomy surgery)
and from the same anatomic site in post-operative patients

 (collected by endoscopy) and performed transcriptomic analysis
by RNA sequencing. EEC purity estimated from the FACS pro-
files ranged from 10% to 50%, compared with �0.1% in the
starting cell populations, so to prevent bias introduced from
non-EECs, we restricted the analysis to genes known to be
differentially expressed and enriched in human EECs (Roberts
et al., 2018a). By PCA, the pre- and post-surgical samples did
not show any distinct clustering (Figure 4A), and the relatively
few EEC genes that did exhibit significant differential expression
between pre- and post-operative samples (Figure 4B) were not
suggestive of major functional differences between the groups.
Interrogation of the dataset for expression patterns of peptides,
G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Figures 4E and 4F), tran-
scription factors, and ion channels (Figures S4K and S4L) also
revealed no segregation between pre- and post-operative
groups.
We performed a similar study in the mouse VSG model using
lean NeuroD1-cre/YFP mice (Li et al., 2012) fed chow diet after
surgery. FACS-purified NeuroD1-positive cells from the top
5 cm or bottom 15 cm of the small intestine and the combined
colon and rectum were analyzed from VSG, sham, and weight-
matched sham animals by RNA sequencing. No differences in
the percentages of sorted EECs were found among the groups
(Figure S4B). PCA of the top 500 differentially expressed genes
revealed that EECs differed according to the intestinal site from
which they were collected, but not by treatment group (Figures
4C and 4D). The top 25 variable genes across all samples
annotated as hormones, transcription factors, GPCRs, and
ion channels are represented as heatmaps in Figures 4G, 4H,
S4I, and S4J, revealing that genes involved in EEC function
were distinct among different intestinal regions but not altered
by surgery. Further clustering analyses examining samples
from each region separately also did not reveal clustering
by treatment based on the top 100 variable genes (Figures
S4C–S4H).
Altered Intestinal Transit after VSG in Mice
An alternative explanation for the increased plasma GLP-1 and
PYY concentrations seen following an OGTT in humans and
mice after gastrectomy is that ingested nutrients transit more
quickly through the upper gut after surgery and penetrate to
more distal regions of the gut before they are absorbed, thus tar-
geting a larger and more distal pool of EECs. To test this hypoth-
esis in the VSG model, mice were gavaged with a mixture of
Ensure and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) dextran and killed
�7 min later to coincide with peak GLP-1 levels measured after
OGTT for collection of the luminal contents, intestinal tissue, and
plasma. The FITC contents of sequential segments of the stom-
ach and intestines were measured by fluorescence, revealing
that FITC dextran penetrated farther down the gut in VSG
compared with sham mice, represented by a higher intestinal
transit (IT) score (Figures 5A and 5B). The study was performed
as a terminal step in the mice that had received either GLP1R
antibody or isotype control for 12 weeks, but no difference in
intestinal transit score was observed between those treated
with the active and those treated with the control antibody.
Across sham and VSG mice, plasma GLP-1, PYY, and GIP levels
triggered by the Ensure liquid meal correlated with the intestinal
transit score (Figures 5C–5E).
DISCUSSION
Lean patients who have undergone gastrectomy with RYGB,
and mice after VSG, provide models to assess the metabolic
responses to intestinal rearrangements without the confound-
ing effects of profound weight loss seen in obese bariatric pa-
tients. Gastrectomy patients exhibit very high GLP-1, PYY, and
insulin levels after an OGTT, mimicking the enteroendocrine
physiology of bariatric surgery (Miholic et al., 1991; Roberts
et al., 2018b).
The results of the Exendin-9 infusion in humans and anti-
GLP1R antibody administration in mice demonstrate that
elevated GLP-1 levels after glucose ingestion in these surgical
groups are a strong driver of hyperinsulinemia. Peak insulin con-
centrations in gastrectomy patients were approximately 2-fold
higher than in control subjects and were restored to normal
levels by Exendin-9. Although other studies in obese humans
have similarly concluded that GLP-1 plays an important role in
driving insulin secretion after bariatric surgery (Jørgensen
et al., 2013; Salehi et al., 2014), studies in mice have yielded con-
flicting results, with some groups arguing in favor (Garibay et al.,
2016) and others against (Douros et al., 2018; Wilson-Pe
´ rez
et al., 2013) this idea (Hutch and Sandoval, 2017; Smith et al.,
2018). Additional improved glucose tolerance arising from
concomitant weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity makes
the interpretation of these types of study in mice particularly
challenging. In practice, the elevated insulin secretion after bar-
iatric surgery likely arises because of the combined rapid eleva-
tions of plasma glucose and GLP-1 occurring after glucose
ingestion. Glucose concentrations rise faster after gastrectomy
because the absence of a gastric reservoir results in rapid entry
of ingested glucose into the small intestine, where it is absorbed
into the bloodstream (Jacobsen et al., 2013). While pancreatic b
cells generate a small secretory response to the rising plasma
glucose concentration, this is strongly potentiated by GLP-1
(Gromada et al., 1998). After surgery, this synergy results in
hyperinsulin secretion that is inappropriate for the ingested
glucose load, and in lean gastrectomy patients with normal insu-
lin sensitivity, the excessive insulin response can be sufficient to
drive hypoglycemia. In obese diabetic bariatric patients who are
relatively insulin resistant, the response is more likely to be seen
as a beneficial lowering of already-elevated plasma glucose con-
centrations (Jørgensen et al., 2013).
Altered patterns of food intake are commonly reported after
bariatric surgery, although the mechanisms remain incompletely
explained (Kittrell et al., 2018; Mathes and Spector, 2012; Miras

 et al., 2012). The lean post-gastrectomy patients also report
difficulties in maintaining body weight, although it is unclear
whether this arises from alterations in the normal signals that
control food intake or a learnt response resulting from the
experience of post-prandial symptoms, commonly referred to
as dumping syndrome. In the current study, we found that
Exendin-9 increased hunger scores after the OGTT, suggesting
that high GLP-1 levels contribute to the suppression of hunger

 in gastrectomy patients. Although elevated endogenous GLP-1
levels after bariatric surgery have not previously been linked to
reductions in hunger, GLP-1 mimetics have been licensed as
anti-obesity agents because of their suppressive effect on food
intake (Nauck and Meier, 2018). The contribution of concomi-
tantly raised PYY levels remains to be established, but in bariat-
ric patients, PYY(3-36) was found to contribute to reduced food
intake (Svane et al., 2016). Our finding that GLP1R blockade did
not influence weight loss in the immediate post-operative period
in mice is consistent with other reports that GLP-1 activity is not
required for weight loss in this model (Wilson-Pe
´ rez et al., 2013;
Ye et al., 2014). However, we did observe a significant increase
in consumption of HFD in VSG mice after GLP1R blockade, sug-
gesting that elevated GLP-1 might play a role in the suppression
of high-fat consumption after surgery.
We found no evidence to support the hypothesis that EECs
exhibit altered peptide production or stimulus responsiveness
after surgery that could potentially explain the elevated GLP-1
and PYY concentrations triggered by food ingestion in these pa-
tients. It was surprising to find that when the jejunum is directly
anastomosed to the esophagus in the human gastrectomy
group, resulting in increased exposure to ingested nutrients
and a loss of exposure to biliary secretions, there was no indica-
tion that its resident EECs altered their properties with respect to
peptide production or general transcriptome. A similar lack of
EEC adaptation was found along the length of the mouse gut,
when we examined different regions by peptidomics and tran-
scriptomics in the murine VSG model. Using LC-MS/MS, we
did not detect pancreatic-type glucagon in the human or mouse
intestine, or GLP-1 in mouse pancreas, either before or after sur-
gery, despite reports that the gut can produce glucagon and the
pancreas can produce GLP-1 under certain pathophysiological
conditions (Chambers et al., 2017; Donath and Burcelin, 2013;
Knop, 2018). The differences between our findings and those
of others might reflect that we used LC-MS/MS to identify
intact peptides, preventing false-positive detection caused by
immunoassay cross-reactivity, or that alternative proglucagon
processing occurs under stressful or pathological conditions
such as obesity and diabetes, which were not present in our
lean models.
When we measured intestinal transit and plasma gut hormone
levels at a fixed time point after gavage feeding in mice, we found
that that food passed considerably farther down the gut after
VSG and that plasma GLP-1, PYY, and GIP concentrations
were strongly correlated with the length of intestine exposed to
the ingested nutrients. The likely explanation for this correlation
is that enhanced gut hormone secretion after bariatric surgery
arises when nutrients make contact with more EECs. GLP-1
and PYY concentrations exhibit particularly marked elevations
after surgery, because these hormones are produced at higher
levels in distal than proximal EECs, and whereas readily digest-
ible nutrients are normally absorbed high up in the gut so that
they make little contact with these distal EECs, a shift in nutrient
absorption to the lower gut targets a larger GLP-1 and PYY-pro-
ducing cell population.
To conclude, the results presented here suggest that the
following sequence of events occurs after bariatric and gastrec-
tomy procedures, with substantial impacts on metabolism. The
anatomic rearrangements and altered nutrient flow and digestion
do not alter EEC properties, but increased nutrient transit to the
distal gut results in enhanced exposure of distal EECs to in-
gested stimuli and consequent elevations of GLP-1 and PYY
secretion. GLP-1, despite having some effect on hunger, is not
required for early post-operative weight loss, but it is a strong
driver of insulin secretion, acting in synergy with high glucose
peaks resulting from rapid glucose absorption. Enhanced insulin
secretion can be beneficial in patients with type 2 diabetes,
because it acts to lower blood glucose, but in patients who are
insulin sensitive, either because they were lean at the time of sur-
gery for gastric cancer or because they lost a lot of weight after
bariatric surgery, the high insulin levels can be sufficient to drive
hypoglycemia. Mimicking the effects of bariatric surgery in

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Human Exendin 9-39 study
All human studies were conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and following NHS HRA and REC
approval (refs: 16/EE/0338; 16/EE/0545), and registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02836353; NCT02971631). Post-gastrectomy par-
ticipants (age 39.2 ± 8.2 [mean ± SD], 1Female:4Male, BMI 22.1 ± 1.8) were recruited from previous research studies and clinical
follow-up at Addenbrooke’s Hospital. All had clinical or biochemical evidence of post-prandial hypoglycaemia. All were screened
for anemia, and hepatic and renal dysfunction prior to recruitment and gave written consent following provision of a detailed infor-
mation leaflet and discussion with the research team. The study required two overnight stays on the Translational Research Facility
(TRF); four of five participants consolidated this to one two-night stay with study interventions on consecutive days (previous studies
using Exendin 9-39 have demonstrated no ongoing effect of the agent after 12 hours).(Calabria et al., 2016)
Participants were admitted at 5pm and provided with a weight-standardized meal, following which they were permitted only water
prior to the study the next day. A Dexcom G4 continuous glucose monitor was sited in the evening to allow it to stabilize and calibrate
prior to study interventions. The following morning, participants were woken at 07:00 to allow study interventions to commence at
07:30.
GMP grade lyophilised synthetic Exendin 9-39 was purchased from Bachem AG (Switzerland), stored at �20�C and supplied to the
TRF through the pharmacy supply chain of Addenbrooke’s Hospital. Exendin 9-39 or placebo infusion was prepared on the morning
of the infusion by the nursing staff on the TRF and infused into a venous cannula. Participant and investigator were blinded to the
infusion contents. Infusions were prepared in low-protein absorbing bags (Macoflex N) in 1% human albumin solution in normal saline
and infused through low-protein absorbing tubing to reduce peptide adsorption. Placebo infusion was identical to the experimental
infusion with the exclusion of only Exendin 9-39.
One cannula was sited in each ante-cubital fossa of the participant (one for infusion, one for blood sampling). Following collection
of baseline bloods and symptom scores, Exendin 9-39 was given as a bolus (7500pmol/kg) over 4 minutes followed immediately by
infusion at 500pmol/kg/minute(Craig et al., 2017), starting at T-40 minutes. Placebo bolus and infusion were at the same rate as for
Exendin 9-39. Blood samples and visual analog scores (VAS) were collected prior to administration of a 50 g OGTT (at T0) and then
every 15 minutes for two hours. Blood was collected into EDTA and LiHep tubes, placed immediately on wet ice, centrifuged at
3500 g for 10 minutes at 4�C, and the plasma separated and snap frozen in 500ml aliquots on dry ice within 30 minutes. VAS were
collected by marking a 10cm line between the statements ‘‘Not at all’’ and ‘‘Extremely,’’ following the questions: ‘‘How hungry are
you right now’’? and ‘‘How full are you right now’’?.

 Initial power calculations suggested 13 participants would be required to reach significance on the primary outcome measure
(nadir blood glucose concentration), however following a change in production policy at Bachem it was not possible to source a
second batch of Exendin 9-39 at GMP grade and so the study was restricted to five participants.
Human transcriptomics and peptidomics study
Participants undergoing total gastrectomy (for the treatment or prevention of gastric cancer) with Roux-en-Y reconstruction
consented to collection of a small cuff of jejunum from the apex of the alimentary limb of the reconstruction (i.e., just distal to the
esophago-jejunal anastomosis) during surgery.
Participants recruited for endoscopy were either undergoing a clinically indicated procedure, or consented to a specific research
endoscopy for tissue collection. For RNaseq, ten biopsies were collected from the apex of the alimentary limb of the Roux-en-Y
reconstruction, for peptidomics two biopsies were collected from the apex of the alimentary limb. Different participants were
recruited for RNaseq and peptidomics to reduce the biopsy burden on each participant. For RNaseq, tissue was used from
3 pre-operative (age 48 ± 24, all male) and 4 post-operative participants (age 48 ± 17, 3Male:1Female), and for peptidomics, from
7 pre-operative (age 69 ± 15, all male) and 4 post-operative participants (age 54 ± 12, 1Male:3Female). All tissue samples were
immediately placed in L-15 media on ice and transferred to the laboratory for processing within 20 minutes.
Mouse VSG surgery
All animal work was performed under the UK Home office project license 70/7824 conforming to the according regulations (Animals
Act Regulations SI 2012/3039).
Standard chow-fed lean male mice on a C57BL6 background aged �20 weeks and weighing 31.5 ± 3g were switched to liquid
diet (Ensure plus chocolate, Abbott laboratories) and single housed 3-4 days before surgery. Surgery was performed as
described(McGavigan et al., 2017). Briefly, mice were anaesthetised using 2%–4% isoflurane, injected with analgesic (Metacam,
2mg/kg, sc), the peritoneal cavity was opened and stomach isolated. For VSG operated mice, 70%–80% in volume of the total
stomach was excised. The remaining stomach pouch was closed with 6-0 suture and returned to the abdominal cavity. For
sham-operated mice, a continuous suture was placed along the line of transection for VSG operated mice but without applying
constraint on the stomach. All animals were given analgesic for 2 days and antibiotics (Baytril, 20mg/kg, sc) for 7 days after surgery
and monitored daily for signs of post-operative complications. Mice that presented evidence of infection or weight loss of > 25% of
their weight on the day of the surgery were excluded from the experiment and humanely culled.
Mice were kept singly housed on cage liners and with standard enrichment on a 12h:12h light cycle. Food intake and body weight
were measured 3 times a week. The sham-operated weight matched group received food twice daily to match their body weight to
the VSG group. VSG operated mice also received 0.1mg/kg B12 (cyanocobalamin) weekly by subcutaneous injection.
Mice were kept on liquid diet for one week before being transitioned back to standard chow in the first experiment. For the GLP1R
blockade study, mice were kept on the liquid diet for 4 weeks after surgery then 4 weeks on a high fat diet (45% energy from fat,
D12451, Research Diets) followed by 2 weeks of control low fat diet (10% energy from fat, D12450H, Research Diets). All food
transitions were done by presenting the new food to the animals one day before removing the previous food.
For the GLP1R blockade, mice were subcutaneously injected with 19.2mg/kg of GLP1R0017 blocking antibody(Biggs et al., 2018)
or control antibody (NIP228, MedImmune) the day before surgery and then weekly for the first 5 injections and then intraperitoneally.
Blood samples were collected just before the antibody injection every two weeks and at the end of the OGTTs to validate the pres-
ence of the antibody in the circulation.
METHOD DETAILS
Mouse OGTT, blood collection and Intestinal transit
In the first experiment, 4 weeks after surgery, mice were fasted overnight (16h) and then gavaged with 1g/kg glucose, and tail blood
glucose levels were measured before and 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min after the gavage using a glucometer (Alpha Trak 2 pet
blood glucose meter) and plasma samples for insulin and GLP-1 were collected at 0, 5 and 15min. The same protocol was used
for the mice treated with the GLP1R blocking antibody, except that OGTTs were performed 2, 4 and 10 weeks after the surgery
when on liquid and LFD respectively.
In the first experiment, 6 weeks after surgery, mice were fasted overnight and then received a 3g/kg glucose challenge. Tail blood
samples were taken before and 5 minutes after the glucose challenge. At �15 minutes after gavage, terminal blood was collected by
cardiac puncture and tissues harvested for the RNaseq analysis. Mice used for the peptidomics analysis were fasted overnight and
terminal blood was collected by cardiac puncture after CO2 asphyxiation.
For the GLP1R blocking study, at 12 weeks after surgery, mice were fasted for 8h and gavaged with 100 mL Ensure with 0.5mg of
70kDa FITC-dextran (Sigma). Mice were killed by CO2 5 minutes after the gavage, and terminal blood collected by cardiac puncture.
Intestinal tissue was harvested and divided into 12 regions, 1 for the stomach / stomach remnant, 8 for small intestine, one for caecum
and 2 for colon and rectum, numbered from 1 for the stomach to 12 for the rectum. Each region was opened and intestinal content
washed in 1mL PBS or 3 mL of PBS for the stomach and caecum regions. Fluorescence of the intestinal content was measured using
Cell Reports 26, 1399–1408.e1–e6, February 5, 2019
e3
 a Tecan M1000 Pro Plate Reader. Intestinal transit score was calculated as the geometric center of the fluorescence fraction per
region(Miller et al., 1981). Plasma gut peptide levels were correlated to the intestinal transit score using a Pearson correlation.
Tail blood was collected in heparin-coated capillaries and terminal blood in EDTA coated tubes (Sarstedt); plasma was separated
by centrifugation and immediately frozen and stored at �80�C until analysis. Hormone concentrations were measured using the
assays detailed in the Key Resources Table.
Human plasma analysis
Human blood samples were collected into EDTA tubes for LC-MS, into lithium heparin tubes for measurement of insulin and glucose,
and into EDTA tubes treated with DPP4 inhibitor (EMD Millipore) and aprotinin for glucagon, GLP-1, GIP and PYY. Samples were
immediately placed on ice and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3500 g at 4�C. Hormone concentrations were measured using the assays
detailed in the Key Resources Table. Glucagon was measured using a modified version of the Mercodia sandwich immunoassay kit
with additional wash steps to reduce cross-reactivity with other proglucagon species (Roberts et al., 2018b). To measure Exendin-9,
a plasma calibration line of Exendin-9 was generated from 0.1 to 10.0 mg/mL and 20mL was extracted using 125mL of 80% ACN with
0.1% formic acid (FA). Supernatant (50 mL) was transferred to a Lo-bind plate and 450 mL of 0.1% FA in water added. LC-MS analysis
was performed on a Waters TQ-XS mass spectrometer with a Waters H-Class UPLC system. Sample (5mL) was injected onto a Wa-
ters HSS T3 50x2.1mm column with a starting condition of 75% A (0.1% FA in water) and 25% B (0.1% FA in ACN) raising to 65%B
over 3 minutes. Exendin 9 was detected using an SRM transition of 843.1 to 396.01 m/z. LC-MS data was processed using the
TargetLynx XS software package (Waters).
Mouse EEC cell sorting and RNaseq
EECs were purified from Neurod1-cre / EYFP mice on chow diet. After the terminal glucose challenge, top 5cm and bottom 15cm of
the small intestine, and large intestine were harvested in L-15 media and kept on ice until processing. Tissue segments were washed
with ice-cold PBS and the muscle layer removed before being incubated at room temperature in PBS containing 15mM (30mM for the
colon) EDTA and 1mM DTT for 7 min. Tissue was then transferred to a tube containing PBS with Y27632 Rock inhibitor (5 mM), shaken
for 30 s, and the remaining tissue returned to the EDTA/DTT. Incubation and shaking steps were repeated 5 times. Villi and crypts in
the PBS/Rock inhibitor solution were collected by centrifugation, incubated for 5 minutes with 0.25% Trypsin EDTA (Sigma) with
0.1mg/mL DNase1 at 37�C, recentrifuged, then completely dispersed into single cells in HBSS (H9394, Sigma) containing 10%
FBS and Y27632, by trituration and filtration through a 50 mm filter. Cells were stained for 1h at 4�C with a PE-coupled antibody
anti-CD45 (EM-05, ThermoFisher Scientifics) used at 1/500 then stained for 5min with DAPI 1 mg/mL in HBSS. Cells were rinsed twice
and DRAQ5 (5 mM, Biolegend) was added. Cells were sorted on a FACSJAZZ (BD Bioscience) at the Cambridge NIHR BRC Cell
Phenotyping Hub based on their size and scatter, excluding debris (DRAQ5 negative), dead cells (DAPI positive) and immune cells
(CD45 positive) to collect 1,500 – 20,000 EECs (EYFP positive). Cells were directly sorted in RLT+ buffer with 1% b-mercaptoethanol
and RNA was extracted using a RNeasy microplus kit (QIAGEN). Concentration and RNA quality were assessed using an Agilent 2100
Bioanalyser. All samples had a RIN value > 5 except for one sample which clustered with all others after analysis.
Libraries for sequencing from 2ng of RNA from each sample were generated using the SMARTer stranded total RNaseq v2 pico
kit (Takara Bio) and libraries were pooled together and single-end 50 bases sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq 4000 at the CRUK
Cambridge Institute Genomics Core.
Human EEC sorting and RNaseq
FACS and RNA extraction from fixed human cells followed a modified version of the MARIS protocol (Hrvatin et al., 2014; Roberts
et al., 2018a). Intestine was rinsed in cold PBS and the muscular coat removed. Diced mucosa was digested twice in 0.1% w/v
collagenase XI (Sigma-Aldrich) in HBSS (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes each time at 37oC, shaking vigorously every 10 minutes.
Supernatants were triturated, passed through a 50mm filter and centrifuged at 300 g. Pellets were resuspended in PBS and fixed
in 4% w/v paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4�C for 20 minutes. PFA-fixed cells were washed twice in nuclease free 1% w/v bovine serum
albumin (BSA) in PBS, and if a fluorescence assisted cell sorting (FACS) facility was not immediately available, were suspended in 1%
w/v BSA and 4% v/v RNAsin plus RNase inhibitor (Promega, WI, USA) in PBS at 4�C overnight.
Cells were permeabilised by the addition of 0.1% w/v Saponin (Sigma-Aldrich) to solutions in all steps from this point until after the
first wash post-secondary antibody staining. Primary antibody staining used 2% v/v rabbit anti-CHGA (Abcam, Cambridge, UK;
Ab15160) and 0.25% v/v rabbit anti-SCG2 (Abcam, Ab12241) and was for one hour in 4% v/v RNAsin, 1% w/v BSA and at 4�C. Cells
were then washed twice in 1% w/v BSA, 1% v/v RNAsin, and secondary antibody staining was for 30 minutes in 4% v/v RNAsin, 1%
w/v BSA and 0.2% v/v donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 647 in PBS at 4�C. Cells were washed twice then suspended in 4% v/v RNAsin, 1%
w/v BSA in PBS on ice for FACS.
Cell populations were sorted on a BD FACS ARIA III in the Cambridge NIHR BRC cell phenotyping hub or at Institut Cochin, Paris.
Single cells positive for Alexa 647 were classified as EECs. At least 5000 cells were collected for each positive population. Twenty
thousand negative cells were collected as the negative (i.e., non-enteroendocrine) cell population. Cells were sorted into 2% v/v
RNAsin in PBS at 4�C.
RNA was extracted using the Ambion Recoverall Total nucleic acid isolation kit for FFPE (Ambion, CA, USA) with modifications to
the protocol as below. The FACS sorted cell suspension was centrifuged at 3000 g for 5 minutes at 4�C and the pellet resuspended in
e4
Cell Reports 26, 1399–1408.e1–e6, February 5, 2019
 200ml digestion buffer with 4ml protease and incubated at 50�C for 3 hours. The solution was then stored at �70�C for at least 12 hours
prior to further extraction. After thawing, RNA was extracted using the manufacturer’s protocol (including a DNase step) with the
exception of performing 2x 60ml elutions from the filter column in the final step.
The RNA solution was concentrated using a RNEasy Minelute cleanup kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). RNA aliquots were diluted to
200ml with nuclease free water. The standard manufacturer’s protocol was followed with the exception that 700ml, not 500ml, of 100%
ethanol was added to the solution in step two, to generate optimum binding conditions for the PFA fragmented RNA. RNA concen-
tration and quality was analyzed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser (Agilent, CA, USA).
cDNA libraries were created using the Clontech SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit – Pico Input Mammalian v2 (Takara Bio,
USA). RNA input quantity was 5ng and the non-fragmentation protocol was used. The standard manufacturer’s protocol was
followed with the exception that 175ml of AMPure beads were used for the final bead purification to ensure recovery of the small
fragments of RNA arising from PFA fixation. Sixteen PCR cycles were used for amplification. 50 base single-end sequencing was
performed using an Illumina HiSEQ 4000 at the CRUK Cambridge Institute Genomics
Peptidomics of intestinal tissue
Intestinal tissue from fasted mice was harvested and sections of 10-20mg were collected every 5cm along the GI tract (from 7 po-
sitions in the small intestine and 3 positions in the large intestine), the stomach remnant and different part from the stomach of the
sham operated mice (lesser curvature, corresponding approximatively to the position of the sample collected in VSG operated mice,
corpus, antrum and fundus) from mice following glucose challenge, and pancreas samples from the mice used for the intestinal
transit challenge (ie after an Ensure challenge), as well as human biopsies collected as previously described. Tissue samples
were directly placed in 250 mL 6M guanidine HCl and homogenized using Lysing Matrix D beads (MPbio). In a Lobind protein
tube (Eppendorf), 800 mL ACN 80% (v/v in water) was added to the samples to precipitate proteins and centrifuged 12,000 g centri-
fugation at 4C for 5min. The aqueous (lower) phase was recovered and dried using a centrifugal vacuum concentrator at room tem-
perature. Samples were then resuspended in 500 mL 0.1% formic acid in water and spiked with internal standard, and peptides were
purified by solid phase extraction (Oasis prime HLB, Waters) and eluted in 60% methanol with 10% acetic acid and 30% H2O. Sam-
ples were dried using a nitrogen flux at 40�C (SPE Dry evaporator system, Biotage) and resuspended in 40 mL 10mM DTT in 50mM
ammonium bicarbonate for 1h at 60�C. 10 mL of 100mM iodoacetamide was added and samples incubated for 30min at room tem-
perature in the dark for reduction alkylation. Finally, 60 mL 0.1% formic acid in water was added and 10 mL of the samples was injected
into a high flow (for the small and large intestine samples) or a nano flow (stomach and pancreas samples) on a Thermo Fisher
Ultimate 3000 nano-LC system coupled to a Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoScientific) as described previously
(Kay et al., 2017; Roberts et al., 2018a). A full scan of 400-1600 m/z was performed and the top 10 ions of each spectrum were
selected for fragmentation and MS/MS analysis.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Data were analyzed and represented using R (v3.4.2) and statistical analysis is described in figure legends accordingly to the data
analyzed as well as the n numbers. Data are represented by median and individual values when possible except when readability
required to present mean ± sd. In the human studies, we did not perform subgroup-analyses by age or gender, due to the low
n-numbers.
Mouse and Human RNasequencing data analysis
Sequenced reads were demultiplexed, quality checked and were aligned on the mouse (GRCm38) or human (GRCh38) genome and
raw counts generated using STAR v2.5.1(Dobin et al., 2013) using the GRCm38.91 or GRCh38.93 annotations. Gene expression was
analyzed using DESeq2 using the operation group in interaction with the region (mouse only) in the model for normalization, log2 fold
change estimation using the lfcShrink function and differential gene expression. Results from the human Deseq2 analysis were then
subset to only the genes that are enriched in human EECs as assessed previously(Roberts et al., 2018a).
Mouse and Human peptidomics data analysis
LC-MS/MS data were analyzed using Peaks v8.5 software using the Mus musculus or the Homo sapiens Swissprot database (down-
loaded 26/10/2017), searching for intact peptides of less than 65 amino acid length, with fixed cysteine carbamidomethylation, while
methionine oxidation, N-terminal pyro-glutamate, N-terminal acetylation and C-terminal amidation modifications were variable. Rela-
tive levels of peptides were assigned by integrating peptide peak areas specifically designated by their m/z and retention time using
the QuanBrowser module in Xcalibur (ThermoFisher) and normalized using the spiked internal standards and the tissue weight.
Insulin rate analysis
Insulin secretory rate (ISR) was calculated using a two-compartment C-peptide deconvolution model, accounting for age, gender
and body surface area, using the ISEC program. Linear mixed effects models were generated as described using the package
lme4 in RStudio, with the lmerTest modification. Model fit and normality were tested by plotting the residuals against the fitted value

 (check for heteroscedasticity), QQ plots for normality of residuals, plots of fitted versus predicted variables to check accuracy of
model, and residual-leverage plots to check for highly leveraged data points.
