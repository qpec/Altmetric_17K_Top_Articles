The contribution of different transportation noise sources to metabolic disorders such as obesity remains un-
derstudied. We evaluated the associations of long-term exposure to road, railway and aircraft noise with mea-
sures of obesity and its subphenotypes using cross-sectional and longitudinal designs.
We assessed 3796 participants from the population-based Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and
Heart Diseases (SAPALDIA), who attended the visits in 2001 (SAP2) and 2010/2011 (SAP3) and who were aged
29–72 at SAP2. At SAP2 we measured body mass index (BMI, kg/m2). At SAP3 we measured BMI, waist cir-
cumference (centimetres) and Kyle body Fat Index (%) and derived overweight, central and general obesity.
Longitudinally for BMI, we derived change in BMI, incidence of overweight and obesity and a 3-category out-
come combining the latter two. We assigned source-specific 5-year mean noise levels before visits and during
follow-up at the most exposed dwelling façade (Lden, dB), using Swiss noise models for 2001 and 2011 and
participants' residential history. Models were adjusted for relevant confounders, including traffic-related air
pollution.
Exposure to road traffic noise was significantly associated with all adiposity subphenotypes, cross-sectionally
(at SAP3) [e.g. beta (95% CI) per 10 dB, BMI: 0.39 (0.18; 0.59); waist circumference: 0.93 (0.37; 1.50)], and with
increased risk of obesity, longitudinally (e.g. RR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.04; 1.51, per 10 dB in 5-year mean). Railway
noise was significantly related to increased risk of overweight. In cross-sectional analyses, we further identified a
stronger association between road traffic noise and BMI among participants with cardiovascular disease and an
association between railway noise and BMI among participants reporting bad sleep. Associations were in-
dependent of the other noise sources, air pollution and robust to all adjustment sets. No associations were
observed for aircraft noise.
Long-term exposure to transportation noise, particularly road traffic noise, may increase the risk of obesity
and could constitute a pathway towards cardiometabolic and other diseases.
1. Introduction
Road, railway, and aircraft traffic represent the most prevalent
transportation noise sources in Europe (European Environment Agency,
2014). Epidemiological studies have mainly focused on road traffic
noise, which constitutes the most prevalent of the three and one of the
major environmental health hazards in Europe (Hänninen et al., 2014;
Mueller et al., 2017; Vienneau et al., 2015). Among other ailments,

 long-term exposure to transportation noise has been consistently asso-
ciated with sleep disturbance and cardiovascular disease, however
evidence for its association with diabetes and particularly with obesity
is still limited to few studies (Basner and McGuire, 2018; Pyko et al.,
2017; van Kempen et al., 2018; Zare Sakhvidi et al., 2018). It is sug-
gested that long-term exposure to noise may affect health through
stress-related reactions and sleep disturbance (Münzel et al., 2016).
These may lead to chronic endocrine and autonomous nervous system
alterations, which may also enhance oxidative, inflammatory, or im-
mune responses (Münzel et al., 2017; Recio et al., 2016; Schmidt et al.,
2013) and finally contribute to cardiometabolic diseases (van Kempen
et al., 2018; Münzel et al., 2016). Moreover, sleep models in rodents
indicate that non-severe sleep disruption induced by environmental
noise contributes to weight gain (Mavanji et al., 2013; Parrish and
Teske, 2017).
Obesity represents a main public health issue worldwide due to its
dramatic increase in the last decades (NCD Risk Factor Collaboration,
2016) and its importance as risk factor of morbidity and mortality
particularly regarding cardiovascular disease, but also diabetes, cancer,
respiratory diseases and overall mortality (The GBD 2015 Obesity
Collaborators, 2017). Understanding the modifiable causal agents of
obesity is crucial to decrease such a trend, however, little is known yet
about the impact of environmental factors such as transportation noise.
To our knowledge, six studies have analysed the cross-sectional
(Christensen et al., 2016; Oftedal et al., 2015; Pyko et al., 2015) or
longitudinal association (Christensen et al., 2015; Eriksson et al., 2014;
Pyko et al., 2017) of transportation noise with obesity markers. Studies
generally indicated positive associations and evidence was greater for
the most commonly assessed exposure (road traffic noise). Out of the
three cross-sectional studies, long-term exposure to road traffic noise
was associated with waist circumference in two (Christensen et al.,
2016; Pyko et al., 2015) and with BMI in one study (Christensen et al.,
2016) in the entire population, whereas a Norwegian study observed
associations with both adipose markers only in highly noise sensitive
women (Oftedal et al., 2015). Two longitudinal studies observed asso-
ciations between road traffic noise with change in waist circumference
but found mixed evidence for change in weight (Christensen et al.,
2015; Pyko et al., 2015). However, the available studies only represent
three independent populations (in Stockholm, Denmark and Norway).
In turn, reported associations between aircraft noise and adiposity
markers all belonged to the same population in Stockholm (Eriksson
et al., 2014; Pyko et al., 2015; Pyko et al., 2017), and results for railway
noise were mixed (Christensen et al., 2015; Christensen et al., 2016;
Pyko et al., 2015; Pyko et al., 2017). Moreover, the proportion of body
fat (Christensen et al., 2016), change in BMI (Eriksson et al., 2014) and
clinically relevant measured outcomes of obesity (categorical) (Pyko
et al., 2017) were rarely addressed. Therefore, further studies from
additional populations are needed, which assess the independent effects
of different transportation noise sources with obesity and its different
sub-phenotypes. Finally, as living near major roads or being exposed to
air pollution has been associated with obesity (Jerrett et al., 2014; Li
et al., 2016), traffic-related air pollution should further be considered as
a potential confounder of the road traffic noise-obesity association.
In the current study of an adult population-based Swiss cohort, we
evaluated the associations between long-term home-outdoor exposure
to road, railway and aircraft noise with measures of general and central
obesity and percent of body fat, using a cross-sectional design, and with
incidence of overweight, obesity and change in BMI, using a long-
itudinal design. We also evaluated effect modification by personal
characteristics such as sleepiness or comorbidities, and noise exposure
modifiers such as sleeping with closed windows or bedroom orienta-
tion.
2. Methodology
2.1. Study population
We assessed 3796 adults from the population-based Swiss Cohort
Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases (SAPALDIA), who
had attended both the second and third examinations. The baseline
recruitment was performed in 1991 (SAP1) and consisted of a random
selection of 9651 adults aged 18–60 years from eight environmentally
diverse areas in Switzerland (Martin et al., 1997). A total of 8047
participated in the first follow-up (SAP2, 2001–2003) (Ackermann-
Liebrich et al., 2005) and 6088 participated in the second follow-up
(SAP3, 2010–2011). Participants completed interviewer-administered
questionnaires about lifestyles, socioeconomic status, environment,
residential history, and health, underwent cardiorespiratory measure-
ments, and provided blood. The latter was stored in a biobank for blood
markers and genetics. The first (SAP2) and second (SAP3) follow-up
represented the baseline and follow-up samples of the present study and
a total of 5881 participated in both (follow-up attrition rate = 26.9%).
Specifically, out of the latter, we assessed a subsample of 4552 parti-
cipants (77.4%), who had answered the longer versions of the main
questionnaire and underwent anthropometric measurements (See Flow
chart in Fig. 1).
The ethics board of the eight SAPALDIA communities approved the
study and all participants signed written informed consent.
2.2. Outcomes
Trained nurses in the study centres examined participants. We
performed objective measures of height (SECA 206 body meter GmbH &
Co. KG., Hamburg, Germany) and weight (SECA 877 GmbH & Co. KG.,
Hamburg, Germany) both in SAP2 and SAP3, following standard pro-
cedures. We derived body mass index (BMI) as the weight (in kg) divided
by the height squared (m2).
In SAP3 (not in SAP2), we also measured participants' abdominal fat
and total body fat with waist circumference and percent body fat, re-
spectively. Waist circumference (cm) was measured using a SECA 201
tape (SECA GmbH & Co. KG., Hamburg, Germany) at the end of passive
expiration over the narrowest part of the trunk between the lowest rib
and the iliac crest or, if not evident, at the level of the umbilicus. Body
fat (%) was measured with bioelectric impedance analysis using a
Helios device (Helios, Forana, Frankfurt, Germany).
To evaluate the clinical relevance and differential risk at SAP3, we
further defined overweight (BMI ≥ 25), obesity (BMI ≥ 30), and central
obesity (for Europeans) as waist circumference ≥ 94 (men) and ≥80
(women), respectively, following the standard classifications by World
Health Organization (World Health Organization, 2011, 2000).
In longitudinal analyses, we derived the change in BMI defined as the
difference between BMI at SAP3 and BMI at SAP2, and assessed the
clinical relevance and severity of BMI change by calculating:
a) the incidence of overweight (BMI at SAP2 < 25 and BMI at
SAP3 ≥ 25)
b) the incidence of obesity (BMI at SAP2 < 30 and BMI at SAP3 ≥ 30)
c) the graded incidence (3-category outcome):
c.1. Reference (BMI at SAP2 and SAP 3 < 25)
c.2. Incidence of overweight only between examinations (BMI at
SAP2 < 25 and at SAP3 between 25 and 29.9)
c.3. Incidence of obesity between examinations (BMI at SAP2 < 30
and BMI at SAP3 ≥ 30).
2.3. Noise exposure assessment
Outdoor exposure to transportation noise (road, railway and air-
craft) was derived from detailed source-specific national Swiss noise
exposure models for years 2001 (for SAP2) and 2011 (for SAP3),

 developed in the context of the SiRENE project (Short and Long Term
Effects of Transportation Noise Exposure) (Karipidis et al., 2014).
Briefly, the aircraft noise modelling included the emissions of one
military and the three major civil airports. Noise levels were calculated
with FLULA2 software, and a combination of traffic statistics (Federal
Office of Civil Aviation), radar data (Zürich airport), acoustical foot-
prints (Basel, Geneva), and idealized number and time of flight paths
for the military airport (Payerne). Railway noise emission levels were
derived using the sonRAIL model and noise propagation was calculated
with the Swiss railway noise model SEMIBEL. The calculation con-
sidered the railway tracks' geometry, location of switch points, noise
barriers, train types, driving speed, and traffic statistics. Road noise
levels were calculated using the sonROAD emission model and the StL-
86 propagation model with input data from 3-D geometry, road slopes,
type and width, speed limits, traffic statistics in an hourly resolution per
each road type, and noise barriers location and height.
Noise models provided A-weighted annual average sound pressure
levels for the day (Lday, 7–19 h), evening (Levening, 19–23 h) and night
(Lnight, 23–7 h) (in dB). For this study, we averaged these time periods
to obtain the standard 24 h-annual average EU indicator Lden (in dB),
with 5 dB and 10 dB penalties for Levening and Lnight, respectively,
according to Directive 2002/49/EC (European Parliament and Council
of the European Union, 2002). To avoid unreliable estimated levels
below the expected background noise level for each source, we further
applied truncation on Lden, as done before (Eze et al., 2017a, 2017b;
Foraster et al., 2017; Héritier et al., 2017). I.e. we applied a value of
35 dB for road and 30 dB for aircraft and railway noise levels when their
levels were below such value (See Fig. S1).
To derive home-outdoor long-term noise exposure, we first geo-
coded all addresses from participants' residential history, which was
self-reported and completed with population registers during the
cleaning process and for unreached participants. Second we assigned
Lden levels at the height of the residential floor from the most exposed
dwelling façade. Third, we calculated the long-term averages as time-
weighted Lden levels accounting for the time lived at each address
during the 5-year period before examination at both SAP2 and SAP3
(main exposure), based on the 2001 and 2011 noise models, respec-
tively. Additionally, to account for residential mobility between ex-
aminations, we also calculated average noise exposure to Lden levels
during follow-up based on the 2011 noise model.
2.4. Air pollution exposure assessment
We assigned outdoor exposure to nitrogen dioxide concentrations
(NO2; μg/m3), an indicator of traffic-related air pollution and potential
confounder of road noise effects, at the geocoded participants' ad-
dresses. We used similar area-specific NO2 models for years 2001 for
SAP2 (Liu et al., 2012) and for 2010/2011 for SAP3 (Eeftens et al.,
2016). These models combined land-use regression (LUR) (considering
traffic variables, population, building density, etc.) with national
Gaussian dispersion estimates at a resolution of 200 × 200 m (with
traffic, agricultural and industrial emission inventories). The 2001 and
2010/2011 models provided similar NO2 estimates (Spearman's rank
correlation in non-movers = 0.8).
2.5. Other explanatory variables
We selected other potentially relevant variables from the interview-
administered questionnaires in both surveys. For both SAP2 and SAP3,
we considered age (years), sex (male/female), cumulative educational
level (low/middle/high), smoking (Current/Former/Never), second-
hand smoke exposure during the last 12 months (No/Yes), alcohol
consumption [daily/weekly/rarely/never, recoded as Yes (any fre-
quency) vs. No (never) for analyses]), consumption of raw vegetables
(days/week), cooked vegetables (days/week), or fish (days/week), self-
reported feeling of often being insufficiently rested after waking up
early in the morning (No/Yes), the Epworth daytime sleepiness score
(0: none, 24: maximal) (Johns, 1991), study area (municipality), and
physical activity (≥150 min/week of at least moderate intensity, Yes/
No) based on exercise duration and intensity according to guidelines

 (World Health Organization, 2010). We considered a walkability index
of 1 × 1 km around home, i.e. a function of the z-scores of residential
density (i.e. proportion of area covered by buildings), intersection
density and land use mix (i.e. diversity of land use types), which in-
dicates how friendly an area is to walking (Frank et al., 2010). Trans-
portation noise annoyance was assessed on an ICBEN (International
Commission on the Biological Effects of Noise) 11-point scale from 0
(not at all annoyed) to 10 (extremely annoyed) (Fields et al., 2001). At
SAP2, we also accounted for neighbourhood-level socio-economic
index, based on the census of 2000 information for median household
income, household occupancy, educational level, and occupation of the
head of household (Panczak et al., 2012).
SAP3 variables also included self-reported doctor-diagnosed cardi-
ovascular disease (No/Yes, defined as hypertension, angina pectoris,
myocardial infarction, stroke, arrhythmia, or cardiac insufficiency),
diabetes (No/Yes, defined as doctor-diagnosed diabetes or taking dia-
betes medication or HbA1c blood levels ≥6.5%, in the absence of
clinical diabetes), self-reported sleep quality during the last month
(Very Bad/Bad/Good/Very Good), bedroom orientation (street/back-
yard), closing windows at night (No/Yes), and the Weinstein's noise
sensitivity score item “Are you sensitive to noise?” in a 6-point scale
from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree) (Weinstein, 1980,
1978). Mean greenness index was defined in a 1000 m buffer around
home, as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in 2014,
using satellite data with a 30 × 30 m resolution (U.S. Geological
Survey, Earth Explorer, 2017; Vienneau et al., 2017).
2.6. Statistical analyses
We evaluated 3796 participants (i.e. 83.4% of the sample answering
the longer surveys, See Flow chart in Fig. 1) who had complete data on
the outcome, exposures, covariates and high quality geocoding (i.e. at
street level) both at the first and second follow-up surveys.
We described the association between all independent variables and
the outcomes, as well as their linearity, by using penalized smoothing
splines, and transformed age to its cubic term to linearize its association
with BMI.
We carried out cross-sectional analyses at SAP3 to evaluate the as-
sociations between the 5-year mean exposure to road, railway and
aircraft noise levels (Lden) and the several obesity markers, which were
only available in this visit (BMI, waist circumference, body fat, over-
weight, obesity, and central obesity). We used multivariable linear or
logistic mixed regression models for continuous or binary outcomes,
respectively, with a random intercept for study area. Models were ad-
justed for potential confounders according to previous literature
(Christensen et al., 2015; Eriksson et al., 2014), following a progressive
adjustment procedure to evaluate their confounding effect. We included
age, age2, age3, sex, cumulative educational level, smoking, second-
hand smoking, cooked vegetables, raw vegetables, and fish consump-
tion, physical activity, and NO2 at SAP3. We further adjusted for noise
annoyance, NDVI and walkability, which could potentially affect the
final noise exposure level and/or the physical activity level determining
adiposity.
In longitudinal analyses between SAP2 and SAP3, we assessed the
association of baseline exposure (5-year mean before SAP2) and follow-
up exposure (follow-up time mean between SAP2 and SAP3) to road,
railway and aircraft noise with: a) incidence of overweight, b) incidence
of obesity c) graded incidence of overweight or obesity, and d) change
in BMI. We used multivariable linear mixed regression models with a
random effect by study area to analyse the association with change in
BMI. To analyse the risk of overweight and obesity (binary incidence
outcomes), we used multivariable Poisson regression with robust
standard errors to control for overdispersion. Because the application of
robust standard errors together with random effects is highly imprecise
with few clusters, and the current analyses were based on only eight
study areas, we first checked for the need to include random effects.
Mixed effects Poisson regression with a random intercept by study area
did not reveal clustering (alpha = 0, Likelihood ratio test p-value = 1).
Therefore, we adjusted for study area as a fixed covariate in the model.
Finally, to analyse the graded risk of overweight or obesity (3-category
outcome) we used multinomial logistic regression also adjusting for
study area as a fixed covariate. All models were adjusted for char-
acteristics at SAP2 corresponding to the same variables described for
cross-sectional analyses, and change in age (i.e. follow-up time), phy-
sical activity, alcohol consumption, and NO2. We also considered fur-
ther adjustment for change in diet, passive and active smoking, and
neighbourhood deprivation index.
We studied potential effect modifiers of the association between the
source-specific noise levels and BMI, introducing interaction terms be-
tween the noise variable and the respective potential modifying factor.
The
selected
effect
modifiers
were:
sex,
daytime
sleepiness
(Normal < 10/High ≥ 10),
insufficiently
rested
(No/Yes),
sleep
quality (Good/Bad), cardiovascular disease (No/Yes), Diabetes (No/
Yes), bedroom facing a backyard (No/Yes), closing windows at night
(No/Yes), noise annoyance (No/Yes), and noise sensitivity (< median
/ ≥ median). This analysis was carried out at SAP3 to maximize the
availability of effect modifiers.
In sensitivity analyses, we assessed potential participation selection
bias due to loss to follow-up from the baseline recruitment (SAP1,
n = 9651) with inverse probability weighting, applying the inverse of
the probability of participating in the present study to the main model.
Probabilities were derived using variables from the baseline recruit-
ment that predicted participation in the present study. We also eval-
uated the exposure-response function using penalized smoothing
splines to assess if the studied associations were linear or if there was a
threshold of effect.
Analyses were performed with Stata version 13.0 (StataCorp,
College Station, TX, USA) and R version 3.1.3 (The R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Statistical significance was
considered at an alpha level of 0.05.
3. Results
The final sample had very similar characteristics to the samples
from which it was derived both at SAP2 and SAP3 (See Table S1), ex-
cept for including slightly higher educated participants than the ori-
ginal SAP2 sample (around 5%) and slightly less current smokers
(around 4%). Part of such changes was due to lost-to-follow-up.
According to Table 1, participants had an average (and median) age of
52 years [interquartile range (IQR): 16.8] at SAP2 and 50% were
women. Time to follow-up was very similar between participants, with
a mean (and median) of 8.3 years (standard deviation: 0.4; IQR: 0.6).
The median (IQR) BMI at SAP2 was 25.1 (5.3) kg/m2 and it exhibited a
median increase of 0.6 (2.0) by SAP3. At SAP3, the median (IQR) waist
circumference and percent body fat were 90.5 (18.8) cm and 30.6
(10.9) %, respectively. In turn, the percentages of overweight, obesity,
and central obesity at SAP3 were 58.2%, 18% and 59.2%, respectively.
The incidence of overweight and obesity at SAP3 were 21.3% and 7.4%,
respectively, and the graded incidence led to 18.8% incident cases with
overweight only and 11.6% with obesity (See Table S2).
Exposure to road traffic noise remained stable between SAP2 and
SAP3, with medians (IQR) of 54.2 (10.1) and 54.0 (10.4) dB, respec-
tively, and > 99% of participants were exposed above the truncation
(background noise) value (See Table 1 and Table S2). In contrast,
railway noise, aircraft noise and NO2 levels changed slightly from 32.9
(11.2) to 30.0 (7.8) dB (% exposed: 61–46.7%), 30.0 (10.6) to 33.9
(8.3) dB (% exposed: 34.5–60.4%), and 21.0 (15.7) to 17.4 (10.2) μg/
m3, respectively. Each of the previous exposures exhibited a high
temporal correlation between SAP2 and SAP3 (Spearman rank r
range = 0.71–0.78) (See Table S3). We also observed a decrease in the
percentage of current smokers and second-hand smokers, an increase in
alcohol consumption, and in physical activity; and no change in diet

 patterns, educational level or the study area of examination.
Spearman rank correlations (See Table S3) further revealed strong
relationships of BMI at SAP3 with BMI at SAP2 (r = 0.91), waist cir-
cumference (r = 0.82), and a moderate correlation with % body fat
(r = 0.42). Percent body fat and waist circumference were less corre-
lated with each other (r = 0.19). Source-specific noise levels were little
correlated with each other and with NO2 (r range = −0.05–0.22), ex-
cept for a moderate correlation between road noise and NO2 (r
range = 0.35–0.43). From all noise sources, road traffic was the one
showing a more consistent relationship with all adiposity markers and
incidence outcomes (See Table S2 and Table S3).
3.1. Cross-sectional analysis at SAP3
In cross-sectional analysis at SAP3 (See Table 2), 5-year mean ex-
posure to road traffic noise was significantly associated with all obesity
markers in the crude and successive adjustment sets, including physical
activity, walkability, exposure to NO2 or green spaces, among others
(See Table 2 and Supplementary Table S4). Specifically, in the fully
adjusted model in Table 2, a 10 dB change in 5-year noise levels was
associated with a statistically significant increase of 0.39 kg/m2 (95%
CI: 0.18; 0.59) in BMI, of 0.45% (95% CI: 0.17; 0.73) in body fat, and of
0.93 cm (95% CI: 0.37; 1.50) in waist circumference. A 10 dB change in
the 5-year noise levels was also associated with a 17% increase in
obesity (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.03; 1.33), a 20% increase in overweight
(OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.08; 1.33), and a 16% increase in central obesity
(OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.04; 1.29). Exposure to railway or aircraft noise
was not associated with any of the obesity markers at SAP3.
3.2. Longitudinal analysis
3.2.1. Road traffic noise
In longitudinal analysis (Fig. 2 and Table S5), exposure to road
traffic noise was significantly associated with risk of obesity both for 5-
year mean exposure before SAP2, i.e. baseline exposure in this study
(RR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.04; 1.51), and with exposure during the follow-
up time between SAP2 and SAP3 (RR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.05; 1.51). The
estimated effect size between road traffic noise and risk of obesity was
greater in the 3-category outcome, and statistically significant for both
exposure windows (e.g. for 5-year mean before SAP2: RR = 1.40, 95%
CI: 1.10; 1.76). No association was observed between exposure to road
traffic noise and incidence of overweight (RR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.84,
1.13, p-value = 0.724) or change in BMI (β = −0.04, 95% CI: -0.13,
0.06, p-value = 0.442), e.g. for 5-year mean before SAP2.
3.2.2. Railway noise
Furthermore (Fig. 2 and Table S5), 5-year mean exposure to railway
noise before SAP2 was significantly associated with risk of overweight
(BMI ≥ 25), (RR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.001; 1.26), whereas it showed a
positive non-significant association with exposure during the follow-up
time. We observed the same pattern for the association between each of
the exposure windows and incidence of overweight only (BMI between
25 and 29.9) in the 3-category outcome. However, we found no asso-
ciation between exposure to railway noise and incidence of obesity or
change in BMI.
3.2.3. Aircraft noise
Exposure to aircraft noise was not associated with any of the in-
cidence outcomes, if anything, there was an indication of a positive
non-significant association between 5-year mean exposure before SAP2
and
incidence
of
overweight
(RR = 1.20,
95%
CI:
0.89,
1.60,
p = 0.233) and overweight only in the 3-category outcome (See Fig. 2
and Table S5). Effect estimates for aircraft noise exhibited wider con-
fidence intervals than those for road and railway noise.
3.2.4. Adjustment sets
Estimated effects in longitudinal analysis changed < 10% for the
different adjustment sets of confounders compared to the magnitude of
the associations described above (See Supplemental Material Table S6).
3.3. Sensitivity analyses
We did not observe a threshold for the start of the effect of road
traffic noise on the obesity markers. I.e. the magnitude of the associa-
tion increased linearly already at low noise levels (See Supplemental
Material, Figs. S2 and S3, p-values for non-linearity > 0.15). We only
observed a departure in the linearity of the association between road
traffic noise and percent body fat. However, this smooth term did not
contribute to the model beyond the linear term (p-value = 0.09).
Finally, the application of inverse probability weighing on the stu-
died associations to control for potential selection bias due to non-
participation yielded similar results in cross-sectional analyses (See
Supplemental Table S7, example for BMI) and similar or even greater
effect estimates in longitudinal analyses (See Supplemental Table S8).

 3.4. Effect modification analysis
According to the interaction analyses (Fig. 3), the association be-
tween 5-year mean exposure to road traffic noise and BMI at SAP3 was
stronger in participants who had reported doctor-diagnosed cardio-
vascular disease (β = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.37; 0.99) than those who did not
(β = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.003; 0.47), p-value of interaction = 0.017. There
was also an association between 5-year mean exposure to railway noise
and BMI in those who reported bad sleep quality (β = 0.63, 95% CI:
0.11; 1.15) but not in those with good sleep quality (β = −0.01, 95%
CI: −0.23; 0.22), p-value of interaction = 0.018. Such association was
also suggestive for participants feeling often insufficiently rested when
waking up, compared with well-rested participants, and for participants
reporting noise sensitivity above the median, compared to the rest.
These interactions, however, were not significant (p-values of interac-
tion = 0.06 and 0.09, respectively). No interactions were detected for
the association between exposure to 5-year mean exposure to aircraft
noise and BMI.
4. Discussion
The present study contributed to the scant evidence available about

 the association between long-term exposure to road, railway and air-
craft noise and obesity. In particular, we were able to evaluate in-
dividual exposure to these most prevalent transportation noise sources,
taking into account residential history and exposure to traffic-related
air pollution, green spaces and walkability, among others. Furthermore,
we analysed objective measures of clinically relevant outcomes, and
importantly, we provided longitudinal evidence for the development of
overweight and obesity. We observed a consistent association between
long-term exposure to road traffic noise and all of the overweight and
obesity indicators (related to general or central obesity and percent
body fat) in cross-sectional analyses and with risk of obesity in long-
itudinal analyses. Exposure to railway noise was only associated with
risk of overweight or overweight only. We observed no associations
related to exposure to aircraft noise.

 4.1. Comparison with cross-sectional studies
To our knowledge, there are six studies from three cohorts assessing
the associations addressed in the present study: one in Denmark (two
studies: one cross-sectional, one longitudinal), one in Norway (cross-
sectional) and the third cohort in Stockholm (three studies: one cross-
sectional and two longitudinal). Compared to the present study, only
the cross-sectional study in Denmark (Christensen et al., 2016) also
assessed BMI, waist circumference, and makers of body fat, and it re-
ported associations of similar to slightly smaller magnitude between
road traffic noise (Lden) and all the obesity markers. Oftedal et al.,
2015 (Norway) only observed associations with waist circumference
and BMI in highly noise sensitive women. Finally, Pyko et al., 2015
(Stockholm) detected associations with waist circumference and central
obesity for road traffic noise (Lden) ≥ 45 dB, but not with BMI.
4.2. Comparison with longitudinal studies
4.2.1. Road traffic noise
Our findings indicate an association between exposure to road
traffic noise and risk of obesity, but not with change in BMI. Actually,
the two previous longitudinal studies also found a null association be-
tween road traffic noise exposure before baseline and change in weight.
However, change in weight is a proxy for change in BMI, which does
not take into account the influence of the person's height on body mass
(Christensen et al., 2015; Pyko et al., 2017). Only with follow-up ex-
posure did Christensen et al., 2015 observed a small positive associa-
tion, though it was borderline significant after adjustment for lifestyles
and based on self-reported weight at follow-up. In ancillary analyses for
comparison, we also found no clear association with change in weight.
This was either slightly negative with road traffic noise exposure before

(β = −0.01 kg,

CI:

p-
value = 0.941) per 10 dB. The previous two studies only observed more
consistent positive associations between exposure to road traffic noise
and change in waist circumference, information not available in our
study.
In contrast, Christensen et al. (2015) observed an association be-
tween exposure to road traffic noise and a binary outcome defined as
risk of weight gain of at least 5 kg between surveys (Yes/No). This as-
sociation had a similar magnitude but was unsignificant in our ancillary
analyses performed for comparison (RR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.98–1.17 for
baseline exposure). We speculate that the lack of association with
change in BMI or weight may relate to the little contrast in these out-
comes and their lower specificity regarding detrimental adipose in-
creases. This might be easier to observe with waist circumference and
with binary outcomes which provide information on a minimal relevant
change and its severity, such as our finding for risk of obesity, a clinical
binary outcome. In turn, although Pyko et al. (2017) did not evaluate
risk of general obesity, they observed an association between exposure
to road traffic noise and risk of central obesity, but not with general
overweight. This would be in line with the present study, which found
an association between road traffic noise and general obesity and no
association with overweight or overweight only. Finally, in line with
the minor changes generally observed in previous studies adjusting for
air pollution (Christensen et al., 2015; Oftedal et al., 2015; Pyko et al.,
2015), we found that associations between road traffic noise and
adiposity markers or risk of obesity were robust to adjustment for
traffic-related air pollution.
4.2.2. Railway noise
Fewer studies have analysed exposure to railway noise in associa-
tion with obesity and results have been inconsistent. Findings point to
positive associations related either to central obesity in one cross-sec-
tional study (Pyko et al., 2015) and to waist circumference and BMI for
Lden > 60 dB (Christensen et al., 2016), or to a risk of weight gain of at
least 5 kg for Lden > 55 dB (Christensen et al., 2015). Only Pyko et al.,
2017 analysed risk of overweight but found no relationship with
railway noise, in contrast with the present study.
4.2.3. Aircraft noise
Of the transportation sources, exposure to aircraft noise was the
least studied and it also led to null associations in the Danish cohort
(Christensen et al., 2015). Previous positive findings with central obe-
sity, cross-sectionally (Pyko et al., 2015) and longitudinally (Eriksson
et al., 2014; Pyko et al., 2017) with change in BMI and waist cir-
cumference, were all related to the same study population in Stock-
holm.
4.3. Effect modification
Regarding effect modification, the current study indicated, based on
cross-sectional analyses, that participants with CVD may be more sus-
ceptible to the impact of road traffic noise on BMI, a finding that should
be replicated in future studies. The association between exposure to
railway noise and BMI was positive in participants reporting noise
sensitivity and those being insufficiently rested, although it was only
statistically significant for participants reporting bad sleep quality. This
could be a spurious finding, nevertheless the consistent effect mod-
ification in self-reported night-time sleep conditions and noise sensi-
tivity might potentially relate to the evidence that suggests a greater
subjective sleep disturbance response related to exposure to railway
than to road traffic noise (Basner et al., 2011; Hong et al., 2010).
4.4. Public health relevance and biological interpretation
Our results suggest that long-term exposure to road traffic noise
could be more detrimental than railway noise, which only increased the
risk of overweight. However, such observation may be also influenced
by the greater exposure to road than to railway or aircraft noise in the
present sample. Interestingly, the severity of the effects of road traffic
noise was reinforced by its association with direct measures of ab-
dominal fat (waist circumference and central obesity) and adiposity
(percent body fat), which predict disease risk beyond BMI (World
Health Organization, 2011; Zeng et al., 2012). Both overweight and
obesity contribute to morbidity and mortality, particularly to CVD but
also to diabetes and cancer (The GBD 2015 Obesity Collaborators,
2017). The magnitude of the estimated effect of road traffic noise in the
present study, combined with its prevalence (European Environment
Agency, 2014), support that reducing exposure to road traffic noise
could substantially reduce the obesity epidemic and decrease morbidity
and mortality world-wide (NCD Risk Factor Collaboration, 2016). En-
vironmental interventions could be particularly effective in preventing
obesity, taking into account the difficulty of changing individual be-
haviours.
The current epidemiological findings may respond to the biological
mechanisms of long-term exposure to noise. These suggest that re-
peated noise-related stress and sleep disturbance would lead to chronic
endocrine and autonomous nervous system alterations (Münzel et al.,
2016), and interrelated oxidative, inflammatory, or immune responses
(Münzel et al., 2017; Recio et al., 2016; Schmidt et al., 2013), con-
tributing to cardiometabolic diseases. The greater impact of railway
noise exposure on BMI at SAP3 among those who reported sleep pro-
blems could potentially point to the noise-related sleep mechanisms and
the subjective perception of railway noise (See Section 4.2). However,
this observation should be confirmed in further studies, which also
consider objective sleep indicators and formal mediation analysis for
more mechanistic insights. Finally, two previous studies suggested an
association between noise annoyance (Foraster et al., 2016) or the noise
exposure level (Roswall et al., 2017) with physical activity, which could
respond to change of behaviour due to noise perception or sleep dis-
turbance, and ultimately impact obesity. However, in the present study,
neither noise annoyance nor physical activity affected any of the as-
sociations between the noise exposure level and obesity markers.
4.5. Strengths and limitations
A major strength of the current study was the evaluation of a pro-
spective population-based cohort, which allowed us to reduce reverse
causality by studying exposure before the outcome happened. The
consistency between longitudinal and cross-sectional results for ex-
posure to road traffic noise further reinforced the findings and support
associations for waist circumference and body fat, despite being only
available at SAP3. We used objective and standard anthropometric
measures, and BMI both at SAP2 and SAP3, as well as clinically relevant
outcomes of overweight and obesity. This allowed us to assess the se-
verity of the estimated effects of transportation noise on obesity in
addition to its continuous change.
Another main strength was the high quality individual estimation of
residential noise exposure for entire Switzerland with models re-
presentative of the different examination years. Moreover, we esti-
mated long-term exposure to transportation noise based on residential
history for each participant. This helped us to reduce exposure mis-
classification and selection bias, and to assess different exposure win-
dows, which provided similar results. Moreover, we were able to assess
exposure modification by closing windows at night or having the bed-
room facing the backyard (Babisch et al., 2014; Foraster et al., 2014),
which did not change findings. Besides, regular use of ear plugs at night
was rare (3.9%), thus its omission is unlikely to affect findings. Non-
differential exposure misclassification may remain from exposure to
transportation and other noise sources at work, assuming day-time
noise affected obesity similarly, which is unclear (Münzel et al., 2016).
In such case, results would be biased towards the null and conservative.
M. Foraster et al.
Environment International 121 (2018) 879–889
887
 Finally, we studied the independent effects of the main transportation
noise sources, and controlled for many confounders, including traffic-
related air pollution, not always available in previous studies. However,
residual confounding can never be discarded.
One common limitation is selection bias due to loss of participants.
Nevertheless, results did not seem to be affected (or were even slightly
conservative) by lost-to-follow-up and missing observations, according
to IPW and the similar characteristics of the final to the original sam-
ples. Therefore, results from this population-based cohort may be
generalizable to the Swiss and other populations with similar noise
exposure levels and sources. Regarding the small sample size in in-
cidence analyses, it did not seem to influence the results for road traffic
noise, which were consistent with cross-sectional analyses. However,
the power to detect effects for railway or aircraft noise could have been
limited due to lower prevalence and smaller contrast of exposure to
these forms of transportation noise in the sample. Moreover, the small
number of participants exposed to aircraft noise at night (12.6% ex-
posed above 30 dB at night) due to restriction of aircraft traffic, might
partly explain the null findings for this exposure, assuming the night-
time was the most relevant period of exposure to develop obesity
(Münzel et al., 2016). Finally, although the residential address history
was mainly self-reported, exposure misclassification seemed limited,
according to the consistent findings across the 5-year time windows
before each survey and the follow-up time window. This may be be-
cause the time to be remembered was rather short. Furthermore, reg-
ister data was used at baseline, to complete the address history during
the cleaning process, and for unreached participants in the next survey.
Observations with low quality geocodes (i.e. not available at street
level) were also excluded from analyses.
5. Conclusions
Long-term exposure to road traffic noise may increase the risk of
obesity. According to cross-sectional results, this impact may relate to
the alteration of all obesity parameters (i.e. high body mass index
(BMI), abdominal fat and total adiposity). These results from the Swiss
SAPALDIA cohort add to the initial evidence on the association between
transportation noise and obesity provided by studies in Sweden,
Denmark, and Norway. Obesity could represent one pathway through
which transportation noise impacts cardiovascular disease and dia-
betes. These findings also shed light on prevention measures against the
obesity epidemic.
