ischemic brain injury after cardiac arrest:
a “two-hit” model

Abstract
Hypoxic ischemic brain injury (HIBI) after cardiac arrest (CA) is a leading cause of mortality and long-term neurologic
disability in survivors. The pathophysiology of HIBI encompasses a heterogeneous cascade that culminates in
secondary brain injury and neuronal cell death. This begins with primary injury to the brain caused by the immediate
cessation of cerebral blood flow following CA. Thereafter, the secondary injury of HIBI takes place in the hours and
days following the initial CA and reperfusion. Among factors that may be implicated in this secondary injury include
reperfusion injury, microcirculatory dysfunction, impaired cerebral autoregulation, hypoxemia, hyperoxia, hyperthermia,
fluctuations in arterial carbon dioxide, and concomitant anemia.
Clarifying the underlying pathophysiology of HIBI is imperative and has been the focus of considerable research to
identify therapeutic targets. Most notably, targeted temperature management has been studied rigorously in preventing
secondary injury after HIBI and is associated with improved outcome compared with hyperthermia. Recent advances
point to important roles of anemia, carbon dioxide perturbations, hypoxemia, hyperoxia, and cerebral edema as
contributing to secondary injury after HIBI and adverse outcomes. Furthermore, breakthroughs in the individualization of
perfusion targets for patients with HIBI using cerebral autoregulation monitoring represent an attractive area of future
work with therapeutic implications.
We provide an in-depth review of the pathophysiology of HIBI to critically evaluate current approaches for the early
treatment of HIBI secondary to CA. Potential therapeutic targets and future research directions are summarized.

Background
Cardiac arrest (CA) is a major cause of mortality and
neurologic disability. The incidence of out-of-hospital
CA is approximately 80 patients per 100,000 persons
annually [1]. Despite advances in resuscitation, outcomes
remain dismal, with 10% of patients surviving until
hospital discharge and 5% experiencing full neurologic
recovery [1].
The primary determinant of outcome after CA is
hypoxic ischemic brain injury (HIBI). HIBI is the
primary cause of death in 68% of inpatient CA and in
23% of out-of-hospital CA [2]. HIBI is associated with
significant
neurologic
disability,
ranging
from
mild
cognitive deficits to minimally conscious and persistent
vegetative states [2, 3]. Consequently, considerable effects
on quality of life and incidence of psychiatric comorbidi-
ties, such as depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress
disorder, are highly prevalent in HIBI survivors [4, 5]. The
vast spectrum of acute and chronic HIBI phenotypes
requires detailed understanding of cerebral physiologic
perturbations that occur after CA and make clarifying the
pathophysiology essential.
Management of HIBI is focused on limiting secondary
injury [3] by optimizing the balance between cerebral

 oxygen delivery (CDO2) and use. Despite rigorous
research, HIBI outcomes have not appreciably changed
over 20 years [6, 7]. This stagnation is in contrast with
improved outcomes in other critical care diseases [8].
Considerable opportunities remain to delineate the
pathophysiology of HIBI. HIBI pathophysiology is a
“two-hit” model, being determined by primary injury
from immediate cessation of CDO2 during CA and sec-
ondary injury occurring after resuscitation. We present a
narrative review of a two-hit model of HIBI pathophysi-
ology as it pertains to physiologic parameters involved in
maintaining the balance of CDO2 and use. We highlight
advances pertaining to cerebral autoregulation, optimal
hemoglobin, carbon dioxide, cerebral edema, normoba-
ric hyperoxia, and targeted temperature management.
Primary injury
During CA, cessation of CDO2 occurs with resultant
neuron ischemia and cell death within minutes [9]
(Fig. 1). The cerebrum consumes 20% to 25% of cardiac
output to maintain function [3]. The brain is devoid of
nutrient stores, and consequently neuroglycopenia and
metabolic crisis occur within minutes after CA [10],
leading to cell death.
As CDO2 decreases, adenosine triphosphate production
halts, causing cessation of energy-dependent ion channel
function [11]. Subsequent intracellular Na+ accumulation
results in cytotoxic edema. Depletion of adenosine tri-
phosphate leads to anaerobic metabolism, cerebral lactate
accumulation, and intracellular acidosis [12]. Additionally,
cellular ischemia causes intracellular Ca2+ influx through
Fig. 1 A schematic demonstrating the various microvascular and cellular pathophysiologic consequences which occur during the primary and
secondary injury in hypoxic ischemic brain injury (HIBI). Decreased cerebral oxygen delivery manifests as reduced neuronal aerobic metabolism,
causing reduced cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. Intracellular calcium accumulation leads to mitochondrial toxicity and further
reduced ATP production. Inability to sustain cellular respiration results in cell death and apoptosis. Additionally, in the microvasculature, endothelial
dysfunction leads to a porous blood-brain barrier, formation of cerebral edema, formation of microthrombi and limitation of cerebral blood flow with
exacerbation of cellular ischemia. AQP 4 Aquaporin-4, RBC Red blood cells, WBC White blood cells

channels,
which
activates
lytic
enzymes [13] and mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby
depleting adenosine triphosphate further [14]. Finally,
excitatory neurotransmitter release activates lipases and
proteases, which leads to apoptosis [15].
Clinically, loss of neurologic function is manifested by
a decreased level of consciousness after global cerebral
ischemia. Historically, Rossen et al. demonstrated that
cessation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) by neck cuff in-
sufflation to 600 mmHg in humans precipitated acute
decreased level of consciousness within 10 seconds [16].
Decreased level of consciousness after CA occurs within
20 seconds after onset of ventricular fibrillation [17].
Loss of neurologic function has been demonstrated by iso-
electric electroencephalography in observational studies
[16]. Pana et al. identified human studies demonstrating
isoelectric electroencephalography rhythms within 15 sec-
onds and 30 seconds of asystole and ventricular fibrilla-
tion, respectively [16]. These findings are corroborated by
animal studies establishing a similar timeline of 10 to
30 seconds from the onset of cerebral ischemia to isoelec-
tric electroencephalography [18].
Although primary injury causes substantial neuronal
loss, the ensuing postresuscitation additive cerebral
injury accounts for significant cerebral ischemia and
cellular death. The key pathophysiologic factors that are
implicated in secondary injury are physiologic modifiers
involved in maintaining the balance between CDO2 and
use. We next discuss secondary injury and physiologic
determinants that are targets of therapeutic interven-
tions after HIBI.
Secondary injury
Secondary injury is the additive cerebral injury charac-
terized by an imbalance in postresuscitation CDO2 and
use, ultimately culminating in neuronal death. It begins
immediately after return of spontaneous circulation
(ROSC). Structures especially susceptible include the
hippocampi, thalami, cerebral cortex, corpus striatum,
and cerebellar vermi [3] (Fig. 2), owing to highly meta-
bolically active tissue. Aside from hypothermia, there are
limited studies examining physiologic variables that
exacerbate secondary injury. Table 1 summarizes the
mechanisms of secondary injury.
Microcirculation and reperfusion injury
After ROSC, microcirculatory perturbations lead to
further neuron dysfunction. The cerebrovascular endo-
thelium plays a critical role in maintaining blood-brain
barrier integrity, regulation of microcirculatory blood
flow, and release of autoanticoagulant mediators [19].
Endothelial functions are compromised, and biomarkers
of cerebrovascular endothelial injury are associated with
adverse outcomes in HIBI [20].
Following ROSC, reperfusion injury causes neuronal
dysfunction despite restoration of CDO2 [21]. An initial
period of cerebral hyperemia is followed by hypoperfu-
sion, resulting in a “no-reflow” [22] state that exacer-
bates secondary injury. Mechanisms implicated in the
no-reflow state include impaired vasomotor regulation,
decreased nitric oxide production, and resultant vaso-
constriction [3, 19, 20]. Extravasation of intravascular

 perivascular edema
leads to
increased
intravascular
viscosity and cerebrovascular resistance [22]. Other
mechanisms implicated in reperfusion injury include free
radical release, glutamate production, and intracellular
Ca2+ accumulation [23].
Endothelial autoanticoagulant dysfunction causes diffuse
microthrombi in the cerebrovasculature [24]. Concomi-
tant impaired vasodilation causes increased cerebrovas-
cular resistance and reduces CBF [3, 22]. Interventional
studies demonstrate that heparin and tissue plasminogen
activator improve microcirculatory flow [25]. These find-
ings have not translated into improved outcomes when
evaluated prospectively, however [24, 26]. Finally, intra-
venous prostacyclin is suggested to promote endothelial
function through vasodilatory and antiplatelet effects [19],
but clinical studies are not yet available. Table 2 summa-
rizes mechanisms involved in reperfusion injury.
Hemoglobin
Hemoglobin is a major determinant of arterial oxygen
content. In animal studies of traumatic brain injury,
concomitant anemia exacerbates secondary injury from
apoptosis [27]. However, physiologic benefits of im-
proved CDO2 from transfusion must be balanced by
risks associated with exogenous red blood cells. Al-
though hemoglobin <70 g/L is the accepted transfusion
threshold for nonbleeding critical care patients [28], it
remains unclear if a liberal threshold is appropriate for
patients with brain injury, who are susceptible to sec-
ondary injury from anemia [29].
Evidence of anemia in contributing to secondary injury
in HIBI is limited to observational studies. Nakao et al.
conducted a retrospective study of 137 subjects with wit-
nessed
CA
and
established
that
higher
admission
hemoglobin was an independent predictor of a 28-day fa-
vorable neurologic outcome (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.00–1.58)
[30]. These findings were corroborated by Wang et al.,
who demonstrated an association with adverse outcome
and lower admission hemoglobin [31]. Recently, Johnson
et al. conducted a multicenter observational study of 598
patients and found that favorable outcome patients had
significantly higher hemoglobin (126 g/L versus 106 g/L,
p < 0.001), a finding that persisted after adjustment [32].
Despite regression adjustment, admission anemia may
be subject to strong residual or unmeasured confounding.
It is unclear if admission hemoglobin captures the magni-
tude of effect that anemia has on secondary injury.
Wormsbecker et al. accounted for this by investigating the
relationship between mean hemoglobin over 7 days and
neurologic outcome. They established that patients with a
favorable outcome had significantly higher 7-day mean
hemoglobin (115 g/L versus 107 g/L, p = 0.05) [33].

 Furthermore, multivariable regression demonstrated that
lower 7-day mean hemoglobin was associated with ad-
verse outcome (OR 0.75 per 10 g/L change in hemoglobin,
95% CI 0.57–0.97) [33]. Importantly, Ameloot et al. estab-
lished a link between hemoglobin and a measure of brain
oxygenation in an observational study of 82 patients. They
found a linear association between hemoglobin and brain re-
gional saturation of oxygen (rSO2) using near-infrared spec-
troscopy [34], with hemoglobin <100 g/L being identified as
a cutoff for lower rSO2 [34]. Additionally, they demonstrated
that mean hemoglobin concentration <123 g/L was associ-
ated with worse neurologic outcome, particularly in pa-
tients with rSO2 < 62.5% (OR 2.88, 95% CI 1.02–8.16)
[34]. Further research is required to establish an associ-
ation between anemia with simultaneous brain hypoxia
and investigate the effect of transfusion thresholds on out-
come in HIBI.
Carbon dioxide
Partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) modu-
lates cerebrovascular resistance and CBF via its effects on
vascular smooth muscle [35]. Specifically, hypocapnia
(PaCO2 < 35 mmHg) induces cerebrovascular vasocon-
striction and decreases CBF by about 2% to 3% for every
1 mmHg of PaCO2 [35]. Clinically, hypocapnia reduces
intracranial pressure (ICP) by reducing cerebrovascular
volume [35]. However, sustained hypocapnia can decrease
CBF, increase cerebral oxygen extraction, and induce ische-
mia [36, 37]. Conversely, hypercapnia (PaCO2 > 45 mmHg)
is a cerebrovascular vasodilator that causes hyperemia, ex-
acerbates ICP [38], and reduces CBF [38]. Hypercapnia is
also associated with excitotoxicity and increased cerebral
oxygen demand [39]. Importantly, PaCO2 vascular reactiv-
ity is preserved after HIBI, making regulation of PaCO2
clinically significant and a crucial determinant of CDO2
[40]. The optimal PaCO2 in individual patients is not
known but presents a unique opportunity for advanced
neurophysiologic monitoring using transcranial Doppler
ultrasonography to evaluate CBF, ICP, and cerebrovascular
resistance with varying PaCO2 levels in HIBI.
Perturbations in PaCO2 in HIBI have been evaluated
in
observational
studies
of
HIBI.
Roberts
et
al.
conducted a retrospective study of 193 patients and in-
vestigated the effects of hypocapnia and hypercapnia
compared with normocapnia (PaCO2 35–45 mmHg) on
outcome. They demonstrated a relationship between ad-
verse neurologic outcome and both hypocapnia (OR
2.43, 95% CI 1.04–5.65) and hypercapnia (OR 2.20, 95%
CI 1.03–4.71) [35]. Exposure of hypocapnia and hyper-
capnia occurred 36% and 42% of the time after CA [35],
respectively, making the exposure of CO2 fluctuation
significant. The authors followed that study with an ana-
lysis of a prospective registry of patients with HIBI and
found a significant association between normocapnia and
good neurologic outcome (OR 4.44, 95% CI 1.33–14.85)
[41]. Schneider et al. conducted a large multicenter data-
base study of 16,542 patients with HIBI and investigated
the effects of hypocapnia in HIBI, and they demonstrated
a significant association between hospital mortality and
hypocapnia (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.00–1.24) compared with
normocapnia [42]. Given the sound biological plausibility
and available clinical data, regulation of PaCO2 warrants
further systematic study to determine the precise optimal
therapeutic strategy after HIBI. Critical links with intracra-
nial physiologic parameters pertaining to ICP, CBF, and
brain oxygenation and fluctuations in PaCO2 are logical
future goals in this field.
Cerebral edema
After HIBI, cerebral edema is a recognized complication
that causes secondary injury. Because of a fixed overall
intracranial volume, an increase in the parenchymal bulk
from cerebral edema in HIBI can cause intracranial
hypertension [43] with resultant decreases in cerebral
perfusion pressure, CBF, and CDO2 [3]. This vicious
cycle of cerebral edema precipitating increased ICP
causes transtentorial herniation and brain death.
The origin of cerebral edema occurs as a result of
either vasogenic or cytotoxic mechanisms. In the early
stages, vasogenic edema emanates from fluid shifts from
the intravascular to the cerebral interstitial space. Key to
this process, aquaporin-4 is a membrane protein that
transports water across cell membranes in the central
nervous system. Aquaporin-4 proteins are located in
perivascular astrocytic endfeet, processes, and ependyma
[44]. The aquaporin-4 perivascular pool is identified as
the predominant cluster involved in the pathophysiology
of cerebral edema after HIBI, with increased aquaporin-
4 expression occurring within 48 h after the onset of
cerebral ischemia [44]. Interestingly, Nakayama et al.
showed that 7.5% hypertonic saline attenuated cerebral
edema in a wild-type mouse model of HIBI but had no
effect in an aquaporin-4-knockout model, thereby demon-
strating the importance of aquaporin-4 in the patho-
physiology
of
cerebral
edema
and
highlighting
its
therapeutic potential [44]. Hypertonic saline administra-
tion also restores blood-brain barrier integrity mediated
by aquaporin-4 in the hippocampi, cerebellum, cortex, and
basal ganglia [44]. Furthermore, Nakayama et al. established
that achieving serum osmolality >350 mOsm/L with con-
tinuous infusion of conivaptan, a V1 and V2 antagonist, at-
tenuated cerebral edema [45], thereby demonstrating that
the effect of aquaporin-4 to decrease cerebral edema occurs
through osmotic gradients, as opposed to a specific intra-
venous osmotic agent itself (e.g., 7.5% hypertonic saline).
Alternatively, cytotoxic edema originates from cellular
metabolic
crisis
and
intracellular
energy
depletion.
Decreased adenosine triphosphate (Fig. 1) leads to

 energy-dependent ion channel failure and intracellular
sodium and water retention. Rungta et al. established
that the Na+Cl− receptor SLC26A11 is a critical modula-
tor of intracellular transport of chloride and subsequent
cerebral edema after ischemia [46]. The authors showed
that blockade of this receptor attenuated cytotoxic cere-
bral edema [46] after HIBI. The role of Na+Cl− receptor
antagonism after HIBI is yet to be clarified but repre-
sents a future therapeutic target.
Furthermore, sulfonylurea receptors are also impli-
cated in the pathophysiology of cerebral edema after
ischemia. Glyburide, a sulfonylurea receptor inhibitor, at-
tenuates malignant cerebral edema after acute middle
cerebral infarction [47]. These findings are corroborated
by animal studies that demonstrate sulfonylurea receptor
antagonism decreases cerebral edema after neuronal
ischemia [48].
Cerebral autoregulation
The brain has an innate ability to regulate blood flow to
match metabolic demands. This phenomenon, termed
cerebral autoregulation, allows the cerebrovasculature to
undergo vasoconstriction and vasodilation over a range
of mean arterial pressure (MAP) to maintain stable CBF
[49]. Cerebral autoregulation mitigates the effects of hy-
poperfusion (ischemia) and hyperperfusion [49].
The identification of individualized MAP targets after
HIBI using cerebral autoregulation monitoring is an
attractive concept that has garnered significant interest.
Initially, Nishizawa et al. demonstrated a linear relation-
ship between MAP and CBF (as indexed by jugular ven-
ous oximetry) [50], suggesting complete dysfunctional
cerebral autoregulation after HIBI. Thereafter, Sundgreen
et al. constructed cerebral autoregulation curves for
patients with HIBI by performing stepwise increases in
MAP with norepinephrine and simultaneously estimating
CBF with middle cerebral artery velocity on the basis of
transcranial Doppler ultrasonography [51]. Of the 18 pa-
tients studied by Sundgreen et al., cerebral autoregulation
was absent in 8 and present in 10 patients. In five of ten
patients with preserved cerebral autoregulation, the lower
limit of autoregulation was right-shifted with a median
MAP 114 mmHg (range 80–120 mmHg) [51]. This senti-
nel study demonstrated the heterogeneous nature of cere-
bral autoregulation in patients with HIBI and suggested
that the lower limit of autoregulation may be significantly
higher than traditional MAP targets after HIBI.
Recently, monitoring with near-infrared spectroscopy
has
garnered
significant
interest
as
a
noninvasive
method of optimal MAP identification and assessment
of cerebral autoregulation after HIBI. Near-infrared
spectroscopy measures the rSO2 in the outermost 2 cm
of the frontal lobe, represents the state of oxygenated
hemoglobin in the microvasculature, and approximates
CBF [52]. Therefore, continually integrating fluctuations
between MAP and rSO2, a Pearson’s product-moment
correlation coefficient is generated. This correlation
coefficient (COx) varies between −1 and +1. Positive COx
values, where there is a positive and linear correlation
between MAP and rSO2, indicate dysfunctional autoregu-
lation [53]. Near-zero and negative COx values indicate
intact autoregulation (i.e., rSO2 remains relatively constant
despite varying MAP). The optimal MAP is identified as
the MAP with the lowest value of COx, as shown in Fig. 3.
Lee et al. demonstrated that COx identified the lower limit
of autoregulation in a swine model of pediatric HIBI [53].
Recently, Ameloot et al. retrospectively calculated COx
using MAP and rSO2 to indicate that autoregulation was
intact in 33 of 51 subjects with HIBI. Thereafter, Pham et
al. showed that COx was significantly higher in nonsurvi-
vors of HIBI than in survivors [54]. Although higher COx
was
associated
with
nonsurvivors,
there
was
no
association between rSO2 and mortality. Recently, our
research team demonstrated feasibility of monitoring COx
in real time and identification of optimal MAP prospect-
ively in 20 patients after CA [55]. Subjects spent approxi-
mately 50% of time outside a ±5 mmHg range from the
optimal MAP, and, importantly, the optimal MAP was
consistently identified in 19 of 20 subjects. The concept of
individualized perfusion pressures is emerging as an at-
tractive therapeutic target and improved clinical outcome
is associated if actual MAP is maintained within proximity
of the identified optimal MAP. It is imperative to
recognize the downsides of targeting significantly right-
shifted optimal MAP, particularly in patients with com-
promised left ventricular function after CA. Increasing
afterload on a decompensated left ventricle can dramatic-
ally reduce stroke volume and cardiac output, placing the
injured brain at increased risk of ischemia. Therefore,
increased MAP targets in HIBI should be weighed against
concurrent myocardial function. Considerable work re-
mains to further delineate if individualized perfusion
targets decrease brain hypoxia and secondary injury and
are associated with improved neurologic outcome.
Temperature
Targeted temperature management has historically been
the focus of considerable HIBI research. It is a mainstay
in the management of HIBI by mitigating secondary
injury after CA [56]. At the cellular level, the beneficial
effects of hypothermia are well documented. Cerebral
metabolism is reduced by 5% to 10% per 1 °C decrease
in core body temperature. In addition, global carbon
dioxide production and oxygen consumption are de-
creased
proportionally
to
reductions
in
core
body
temperature [57]. By decreasing cerebral metabolism,
hypothermia
avoids excessive
intracellular
anaerobic
metabolism, which leads to increased lactate production.
Sekhon et al. Critical Care  (2017) 21:90 
Page 6 of 10
 Hypothermia also improves cerebral glucose use and
allows available cellular energy stores to be used for
necessary cellular functions in keeping with neuronal
survival [56]. Additional benefits of hypothermia include
prevention of apoptosis by decreasing proapoptotic
mediators such as p53, tumor necrosis factor α, and
caspase enzymes while increasing expression of antia-
poptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 [56, 57]. Hypothermia
also prevents mitochondrial dysfunction, a key pathway
involved in the promotion of apoptosis by release of
cytochrome c oxidase into the cellular cytoplasm [56].
Finally, hypothermia decreases inflammatory mediators
such as the interleukin-1 family of cytokines [58] as well
as chemotaxis of leukocytes into cerebral interstitial
tissue [56], reduces excitotoxic neurotransmitter release
(glutamate and glycine) [57], and decreases free radical
production after HIBI [57]. Sustained hypothermia also
has detrimental physiologic effects pertaining to immune
suppression, hemoconcentration, coagulopathy, arrhyth-
mias, electrolyte disturbances, and hemodynamic in-
stability, which must be weighed against the possible
benefits [56]. Furthermore, unintentional hypothermia
can occur after CA, indicating possible severe damage to
the key centers of thermoregulation, including the hypo-
thalamus [56].
Hyperthermia is associated with numerous pathophys-
iologic sequelae that are potentially harmful after HIBI.
Specifically, hyperthermia may increase blood-brain bar-
rier permeability, leading to worsening cerebral edema,
ICP,, and cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, hyperthermia
increases glutamate production, which in turn causes
intracellular Ca2+ influx, leading to neuronal cell death,
seizures, and further secondary injury [3]. Increased
cerebral metabolism, hyperemic blood flow, and in-
creased ICP are additional downstream consequences of
uncontrolled hyperthermia in HIBI [3]. Recently, we
showed that hyperthermia is associated with dysfunc-
tional autoregulation in patients with HIBI [55].
Clinical studies have established a firm link between
hypothermia and improved outcome after CA. In 2002,
two randomized controlled trials demonstrated marked
improvement in clinical outcomes in patients with CA
after ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia
who were treated with hypothermia compared with
standard of care [6, 59]. A persistent criticism of both
studies was that the standard-of-care groups maintained
core
body
temperatures
>37
°C,
thereby
exposing
patients to the harmful effects of hyperthermia. This
prompted a third recent randomized controlled trial
comparing core body temperature control of 36 °C
(normothermia) versus 33 °C (hypothermia) after CA
[7]. This pragmatic trial included patients with HIBI
with all initial cardiac rhythms and ultimately did not
demonstrate an appreciable benefit of
hypothermia
versus normothermia [7]. Importantly, it must be stated
that the maintenance of normothermia at 36 °C after CA
requires active cooling. The negative effects of sustained
hyperthermia and adverse outcomes after CA are well
established [60, 61], thereby reinforcing the importance
of aggressive core body temperature control in patients
following CA. It is possible that individualized tem-
perature targets exist within patients with HIBI, and the
inability of current studies to concurrently monitor
cerebral metabolism, ICP, and biomarkers of neuron
Fig. 3 The zone of preserved autoregulation after hypoxic ischemic brain injury appears to be narrowed and right-shifted after cardiac arrest.
Within the zone of autoregulation, regional saturation of oxygen (rSO2) is stable owing to the innate vasoconstriction and vasodilation of the
cerebral vasculature to maintain stable cerebral blood flow. Outside the zone of autoregulation, a linear relationship exists between rSO2 and
mean arterial pressure (MAP). By continually integrating the fluctuations of MAP and rSO2 with one another, a correlation coefficient (COx) can
be generated. The COx approaches negative values or near-zero within the preserved zone of autoregulation, resulting in a U-shaped curve. The
nadir of the U-shaped curve represents the optimal MAP (MAPOPT) for each individual patient

 degeneration has limited our ability to make these
patient-specific distinctions.
Normobaric hyperoxia
The dissolved portion of oxygen in plasma is a minor
contributor to overall oxygen content. However, in
disease states, this portion may have a pivotal role in
ensuring adequate hemoglobin saturation for CDO2 and
overcome diffusion barriers to restore normal cellular
metabolism. Augmenting arterial oxygen content is tou-
ted as a crucial modifiable factor in optimizing CDO2
after HIBI, with normobaric hyperoxia being suggested
to achieve this goal.
Upon ROSC, reperfusion injury occurs as a result of
oxygen free radical production, which leads to intracellu-
lar oxidation [62]. Examples include superoxide (O2
−),
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl anion (OH−), and
nitrite (NO2
−). Endogenous antioxidants balance the
generation of free radicals and stabilize cellular function.
Inadvertent normobaric hyperoxia in HIBI may tip this
balance in favor of free radical production, cellular
oxidation, and neuronal death [62]. Although a system-
atic review of animal studies of HIBI suggested that
increased neuron dysfunction occurs after normobaric
hyperoxia, there was significant between-study heterogen-
eity with respect to ventilation strategies, timing and dose
of normobaric hyperoxia, concomitant use of hypothermia,
and the chosen primary outcomes [63]. There are also
several reported adverse effects associated with normobaric
hyperoxia, including increased vascular resistance (cerebral,
myocardial, and systemic), decreased CBF, seizures, and
increased release neuronal degeneration biomarkers such
as neuron-specific enolase [57, 62, 64, 65].
Researchers in several studies have evaluated normo-
baric hyperoxia in HIBI, with conflicting results. Kuisma
et al. conducted a randomized study of patients who
were given 21% or 100% inspired oxygen after ROSC
[66]. The group that received 21% inspired oxygen
exhibited lower serum levels of neuron-specific enolase
than the normobaric hyperoxia group that did not
undergo concomitant hypothermia. Kilgannon et al. in-
terrogated the Project IMPACT database with more than
400,000 patients [67]. They included patients with non-
traumatic CA and cardiopulmonary resuscitation within
24 h prior to intensive care admission. Their objective
was to examine the association between hyperoxia and
mortality. Compared with the subjects in the normoxia
group, subjects with normobaric hyperoxia (partial pres-
sure of arterial oxygen [PaO2] >300 mmHg) had higher as-
sociated in-hospital mortality (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.5–2.2).
Compared with normoxia, hypoxia (PaO2 < 60 mmHg)
was also associated with increased in-hospital mortality
(OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1–1.5). Spindelboeck et al. studied nor-
mobaric hyperoxia and hypoxemia during CA and found
that both were associated with increased mortality [68],
suggesting that the deleterious effects of normobaric
hyperoxia may occur in early stages of HIBI. Finally,
Bellomo et al. conducted a retrospective analysis of
patients with CA and demonstrated that normobaric
hyperoxia and hypoxemia were associated with increased
mortality; however, after adjustment, this relationship was
no longer significant [69]. Importantly, significant limita-
tions in methodology should be noted, particularly the
retrospective nature of these studies, the limitation of
using mortality as a primary outcome in a brain injury
population, and the fact that the definition of normobaric
hyperoxia with a single PaO2 > 300 mmHg does not cap-
ture the true biological exposure of patients to normobaric
hyperoxia after CA. Furthermore, hypothermia was not
routinely used in the aforementioned studies.
Additional retrospective analyses investigating the use of
normobaric hyperoxia with concomitant hypothermia
have addressed this shortcoming. Janz et al. demonstrated
an association between adverse neurologic outcome and
normobaric hyperoxia administration [70]. These results
are contrasted by those reported by Ihle et al. and Lee et
al., who failed to show an association between normobaric
hyperoxia and adverse neurologic outcome with concomi-
tant hypothermia [71, 72]. Thereafter, a prospective study
revealed an association between favorable neurologic out-
come and higher mean PaO2 [73]. Thus, concomitant
hypothermia may play a role in modifying the deleterious
effects of normobaric hyperoxia in HIBI.
Conclusions
HIBI pathophysiology is complex, with a significant con-
tribution attributable to secondary injury. Researchers
have investigated the effects of interventions aimed at
preventing secondary injury, most notably hypothermia.
Future targets of research include individualized perfu-
sion targets, normobaric hyperoxia, transfusion triggers,
and PaCO2 goals.
