Abstract
Background: There is growing interest in patient outcomes following critical illness, with an increasing number
and different types of studies conducted, and a need for synthesis of existing findings to help inform the field. For
this purpose we conducted a systematic review of qualitative studies evaluating patient outcomes after hospital
discharge for survivors of critical illness.
Methods: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL databases from inception to
June 2015. Studies were eligible for inclusion if the study population was >50 % adults discharged from the ICU,
with qualitative evaluation of patient outcomes. Studies were excluded if they focused on specific ICU patient
populations or specialty ICUs. Citations were screened in duplicate, and two reviewers extracted data sequentially
for each eligible article. Themes related to patient outcome domains were coded and categorized based on the
main domains of the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) framework.
Results: A total of 2735 citations were screened, and 22 full-text articles were eligible, with year of publication
ranging from 1995 to 2015. All of the qualitative themes were extracted from eligible studies and then categorized
using PROMIS descriptors: satisfaction with life (16 studies), including positive outlook, acceptance, gratitude,
independence, boredom, loneliness, and wishing they had not lived; mental health (15 articles), including
symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and irritability/anger; physical health (14 articles),
including mobility, activities of daily living, fatigue, appetite, sensory changes, muscle weakness, and sleep
disturbances; social health (seven articles), including changes in friends/family relationships; and ability to participate
in social roles and activities (six articles), including hobbies and disability.
Conclusion: ICU survivors may experience positive emotions and life satisfaction; however, a wide range of
mental, physical, social, and functional sequelae occur after hospital discharge. These findings are important for
understanding patient-centered outcomes in critical care and providing focus for future interventional studies
aimed at improving outcomes of importance to ICU survivors.

 Background
With the aging population, the number of patients ad-
mitted to ICUs continues to grow, as does the number
of ICU survivors [1, 2]. These survivors frequently have
substantial morbidity after hospital discharge, including
physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments
[3–6], collectively known as post-intensive care syn-
drome (PICS) [7]. These morbidities frequently co-
occur and may be associated with significant disability
and impaired quality of life [8–11].
To address this issue, there is a growing need to de-
velop interventions that can improve patient outcomes.
An essential part of this process is developing a patient-
centered “core outcome set” of measures that should be
evaluated and reported in all clinical trials evaluating
post-discharge outcomes in ICU survivors [12]. Core
outcome sets allow more direct comparison of trial find-
ings to draw more meaningful synthesis and conclusions
on the effectiveness of interventions [13, 14]. However,
the complex nature of outcomes after critical illness
necessitates having an in-depth understanding of the
problems ICU survivors face following hospital dis-
charge. The patients’ perspective is essential in gaining
this understanding. Qualitative research is a well-known
methodology to collect and analyze in-depth information
from patients, particularly on their health status that
may help inform development of core outcome sets [15].
Recently, there has been an increase in qualitative re-
search published on the patient perspective following
critical illness [16–20]. In addition, qualitative re-
search is increasingly being recognized as an import-
ant contribution to randomized controlled trials, with
an important value in planning the trial, identifying
important patient outcomes, and adding context to
the trial findings [21, 22].
The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Infor-
mation System (PROMIS) framework, developed by the
US National Institutes of Health, represents a framework
of health domains to report and understand patient-
centered outcomes [23, 24]. Through this systematic re-
view, we aim to identify and categorize important
themes of patient-centered outcomes after critical illness
from qualitative research, based on this framework of
PROMIS domains. Findings from this study will help in-
form the development of core outcome sets for ICU
survivors.
Methods
Reporting of this systematic review was done according
to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
(PRISMA) guidelines [25] where applicable. A written
protocol and search strategy were developed, but were
not publicly registered.
Search strategy
Five electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cumula-
tive Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature
(CINAHL), PsycINFO®, and the Cochrane Controlled
Trials Registry (CENTRAL)) were searched for articles
including any patient outcome assessments after hospital
discharge in survivors of critical illness, based on a strat-
egy developed for a scoping review (Additional file 1:
Table S1) [14]. Within this broad search strategy, add-
itional filters were applied to identify articles with quali-
tative findings, as defined in Additional file 1: Table S2
[26]. The search was conducted in June 2015, and was
not limited by language or date of publication. A manual
search of reference lists from all articles eligible for this
systematic review was also performed.
Study selection
Articles were eligible for inclusion in this systematic re-
view if the study population was adults (>18 years old)
and >50 % of them were discharged from the ICU, and if
the study included qualitative findings focusing on pa-
tient outcomes after hospital discharge. Qualitative find-
ings were defined as themes or quotes, or a combination
of both, reported from patient/proxy interviews. To cap-
ture a broad range of qualitative research and maximize
content for our thematic analysis, we included all quali-
tative research methodologies in eligible studies, includ-
ing patient/proxy interviews, focus groups, and open-
ended surveys [27]. To help ensure findings were
generalizable to broad populations of ICU survivors,
studies were excluded if they focused exclusively on a
specific patient population (e.g., liver transplant) or
specialty ICU (e.g., trauma or neurological ICUs), similar
to prior published systematic reviews of ICU survivors
[4, 6, 28, 29]. Using these eligibility criteria, trained
reviewers (UN, SN, KN, and MDH) screened titles/ab-
stracts and full-text articles in duplicate, using Distil-
lerSR©
(2014;
Evidence
Partners,
Ottawa,
Canada;
https://v2.systematic-review.ca). Disagreement regarding
eligibility was resolved by consensus, after discussion
with a third party (MNE, DMN, or VDD).
Data extraction
Data were extracted sequentially by two trained research
staff (AN and MDH) for each eligible article, with one
reviewer extracting data and a second comparing the
data against the original article. Extracted data included
patient demographics, study type (e.g., focus groups,
semi-structured interviews, ethnographic observations,
etc.), and all qualitative themes identified and re-
ported. In addition, a quality assessment of eligible
studies was conducted, adapted from a previously
published
standardized
framework

on

 Skills Programme (http://www.casp-uk.net/#!casp-tools-
checklists/c18f8). This quality assessment included ap-
praisal of the rationale for qualitative methods, sample
size, description of ineligible patients and those who chose
not to participate in the study, use of a recording method,
use of an interview guide, reporting coding reliability
statistics, reporting number of coders per interview,

of
discrepancies,
using a codebook, using a theory, and supporting
themes by quotes.
Data synthesis
All themes relevant to patient outcomes after hospital
discharge were identified and extracted from all eligible
studies. For studies that included patient and proxy out-
comes, only themes that were specific to the patient
were
included.
Through
discussion
and
consensus
among three reviewers (MNE, VDD, and MDH), these
themes were coded and then categorized using the
following main domains of the PROMIS framework
[23, 24]: mental health conditions/symptoms (which
encompasses cognitive outcomes), physical health, and
social health including ability to participate in social
roles and activities [31]—global satisfaction with life
was added as a separate domain owing to its import-
ance for survivors of critical illness.
Results
Study selection
Search results identified 2735 citations. After removing
duplicates across databases, 2376 unique abstracts and
titles were screened to meet the inclusion criteria, from
which 459 full-text articles were reviewed, and 22 met
eligibility criteria (Additional file 1: Figure S1).
Study details
Table 1 presents details of the 22 eligible studies, con-
ducted in 10 different countries. Only three (14 %) stud-
ies were conducted prior to the year 2000 [32–34]. A
total of 17 (77 %) studies were longitudinal with a max-
imum of five follow-up time points, with 15 (68 %) of
the studies involving patient report only and seven
(32 %) studies involving both patient and caregiver/
proxy reports. The majority of studies utilized open-
ended patient/proxy interviews, while two (9 %) studies
utilized focus groups. Data were collected exclusively in
person in 16 (73 %) studies, with the remaining collected
by telephone, mail, or Internet survey, or a combination
of these methods.
Quality appraisal
The majority of eligible studies (86 %) described a ra-
tionale for using qualitative methods, developed a code-
book (72 %), used theory (73 %), and had themes
supported by quotations from the patient assessments
(86 %). On the other hand, only a minority of studies de-
scribed a rationale for the sample size (e.g., data satur-
ation) (23 %), or discussed which patients were ineligible
(36 %) or which chose not to participate (18 %). Seven
studies (32 %) reported using ≥2 coders per interview
(Additional file 1: Table S3).
Thematic findings
Thematic findings were represented in five major do-
mains adapted from PROMIS; global satisfaction with
life, mental health, physical health, social health, and
ability to participate in social roles and activities (Fig. 1).
Interestingly, older studies more often focused on men-
tal health (mainly depression and post-traumatic stress
disorder) [33–35], while physical health, global satisfac-
tion with life, and social health appeared more often in
newer studies [18, 36–38].
Global satisfaction with life
The domain of global satisfaction with life reflected
themes that represented global patient functioning and
were not specific to a particular PROMIS domain. These
themes include a range of positive and negative emo-
tions (Table 2). In 10 studies, patients described positive
emotions related to their overall view of life in response
to critical illness, such as finding a new source of motiv-
ation and strength [32, 36–44]. Acceptance was another
common theme, emerging from seven studies, whereby
patients described how their feelings transformed from
anger and denial to accepting the consequences of their
illness and trying to move on [34, 36, 38, 40–42, 45]. In
addition, gratitude emerged from five studies, where pa-
tients felt thankful for surviving critical illness, with dee-
per appreciation of the
value of life [36–39, 46].
Independence was identified in four studies, with pa-
tients commenting on the value of being able to do basic
tasks without assistance [16, 18, 40, 41]. On the con-
trary, patients in four studies commented on having
negative
emotions
related
to
satisfaction
with
life;
themes generated from these studies included boredom
[37], loneliness/isolation [38, 44], and feeling that they
wish they had not lived [35].
Mental health
Mental
health
was
a
commonly
identified
domain
(Table 3). The theme of post-traumatic stress disorder
symptoms was identified in eight studies, emerging from
the experience of having recurrent dreams/nightmares
or flashbacks related to the ICU stay [33, 34, 38, 45, 47,
48], as well as the negative emotions that arose when
reminded of their critical illness (e.g., driving near a hos-
pital, or even seeing/hearing sirens or alarms on radio or
television [35, 36]). Similarly, anxiety symptoms was a

Page 3 of 10
 common theme in eight studies, where patients de-
scribed constant fear [37, 49, 50], worrying [35, 42, 45],
and
panic
attacks
[36,
45].
Depression
symptoms
emerged from six studies, where patients commented on
“not seeing the point of anything” [51], inability to look
forward [33], feeling disappointed [50], depressed [45],
and crying uncontrollably for no reason [35, 44, 51].
Irritability/anger was less commonly described, in just
three studies, whereby patients reported frustration with
disabilities [50] and deformities [37], as well as feeling
“on guard” [45]. Overall emotional functioning was
described in seven studies with themes that did not
clearly map onto a well-described psychological dis-
order, including general mood changes [33, 47, 49, 50],
inability to cope with stress [33, 35, 51], and loss of
motivation [37].

 Physical health
Physical health was another common domain (Table 4).
Mobility was an important theme highlighted in eight stud-
ies; patients’ impaired mobility following discharge had a
major impact on their overall wellbeing [16, 18, 40, 42, 47],
due to the impact on their ability to complete daily activ-
ities or return to work. This was highlighted by patients
reporting about the importance of regaining mobility, even
if only partially [16, 18, 37, 38, 40]. Also important was
regaining the capacity to perform activities of daily living,
identified in five studies, which appears to be important for
both patients [16, 48, 50] and caregivers [18, 41]. Fatigue
and subjective feeling of weakness were identified in four
studies [16, 18, 33, 50]. Sleep disturbances emerged as a
recurring theme in three studies, where patients com-
plained of nightmares [45] and recurrent sleep interrup-
tions [33, 35, 45]. Other less common themes were
disturbances in appetite [45, 50], sensory changes [18, 37],
and muscle weakness [16].
Social health
Social health was the fourth identified major domain
(Table 5). Changes in friends or family relationships was a
recurring theme; these changes were described in the form
of patients not enjoying being with people anymore [38],
feeling like a burden [35], feeling annoyed as a result of
new restrictions enacted by family, or feeling “not needed”
by family [38]. On the contrary, two studies highlighted

Table 2 Qualitative themes of satisfaction with life
Theme
Example quote(s)
Positive outlook
1. “I have got such a different outlook on life … I’ll have the odd day where I will dwell a bit … but everyday is a new day
and its a beautiful day … I’m a different person.”
2. “One might well say that it has been for me, even though it sounds strange—a good experience. And the fact that I
continually find out more about the emotionally strong memories I have, actually provides me with insight into myself!”
Acceptance
“You live with what you’ve got—–that is the attitude I took. Alright I’m sick and I’ve got this and I’ve got that. I can’t do this
and maybe I won’t be able to do that, so you adjust and you move on.”
Gratitude
1. “I try to cram in as much living as I can, because it could all end tomorrow …”
2. “I look out from the window and I see people walking and I cry out of joy, because I am alive … and I had never realized
that before …”
Independence
“It's great in a way [being back at home) because you have to do things on your own. And then you start getting stronger
and you take your rest breaks, and you do it again, and you do get assistance, you would need the assistance like for grocery
shopping and stuff like that. But as time goes by you start getting stronger.”
Boredom
“… that’s the worst thing about coming out of hospital, sitting doing nothing …”
Loneliness/isolation
“I do not enjoy being with people, usually I keep silent. I don’t want to be with them or to share their talks … They asked a lot
… They asked about being in the unit … I feel that they sympathize with me … I do not want to remember that time.”
Wish they had not
lived
“Sometimes in the evenings I’ve thought to myself … ‘hell, it would have been better to have slipped away’ … then you feel
nothing.”

 how patients saw improvement in social functioning after
critical illness, such as recognizing the importance of family
in a crisis situation [36] and getting to see friends as an im-
portant part of the recovery process [45].
Ability to participate in social roles and activities
The domain of ability to participate in social roles and
activities, which is categorized under social health ac-
cording to the PROMIS framework, was the fifth major
domain (Table 5). Getting back to previous hobbies was
an important source of motivation during recovery
[42, 45]. On the contrary, the inability to perform
prior activities was regarded as a form of disability
and distress [37, 42]. This theme was often described
in connection with physical and emotional function-
ing and deeply impacted survivors’ overall satisfaction
with life. The change in work status was often a
major issue for patients as they either celebrated their
ability to return to work or had to reconcile a major
life change if they were unable to return to work.
Discussion
In this systematic review of qualitative studies of general
critical illness survivors, themes related to outcomes
Table 3 Qualitative themes of mental health conditions/symptoms
Theme
Example quote(s)
Post-traumatic stress disorder
symptoms
1. “I often wake up terrified because I had dreams of being in the unit with all the sounds and noises of machines.
Even when I’m awake and with people, many things remind me of the unit, people talking, and images from the
TV.”
2. “It’s enough that someone says something on the radio, mentions the term intensive care or something, or when
you watch teletext or TV and that word crops up, or there’s a nurse working with … at the ICU, ugh, then I feel
exactly like I did then.”
Anxiety
1. “I was having these major panic attacks when I arrived in Cardiology and I’m still having them, even now that I’m
home, it’s often in the evening, every evening I get really panicky.”
2. “Previously I was a harmonious, calm, positive and stable person, now things are different … I’m more insecure
and nervous, which I wasn’t before.”
Depression
“There are still days even, what are we six, seven months on now, yeah I just couldn't see the point of anything …
in my mind I was thinking ‘Well what's the point of it, we're all going to die anyway?’ And I needed to speak to, I
went back and spoke to the nurse consultant on ICU and she explained it’s perfectly normal. And that helped, once
she said to me, ‘Loads of people feel like that when they come out of intensive care and you need to be kind and
give yourself a bit of time, it will pass.’”
Irritability/anger
1. “I am now beginning to get frustrated with the things I still cannot do … I am finding it increasingly difficult
mentally to cope with my recovery.”
2. “After a while, well, I’m not a nasty person, but I’m more on my guard now …; I’m more irritable, more nervous.”
General emotional functioning
1. “I cried for the slightest reason … it … only took the smallest setback.”
2. “You could never imagine the emotional side even if you were prepared … emotionally it was a rollercoaster.”
Table 4 Qualitative themes of physical health
Theme
Example quote(s)
Mobility
1. “I can move now, before, I thought I will stay handicapped all my life. But never mind, I feel grateful just to have the ability to
walk again …”
2. “Then I had to try to get up with a walker and I just couldn’t. I couldn’t even hold my head. I wasn’t able to do anything.”
Activities of daily
living
1. “My day-to-day life is anything but normal. I want to be able to cook, clean and do the gardening, walk to the shops …
recovery has been reasonable.”
2. “For the first couple of weeks, we were sort of … doing things like getting his clothes and organizing his shower and all that
sort of thing. I practically was just running around doing little bits for him, organizing what tablets he had to take and all this
sort of thing.”
Fatigue
1. “I probably went too far. I mean, I was at home and tried to arrange that my husband didn’t need to come home and do
things. But then I was tired and couldn’t handle it anyway.”
2. “I need an afternoon nap, sometimes two …”
Appetite
“Now it’s going ok again, I’m eating well, and I’m sleeping so well! I feel better, even better than before …, a little frustration at
not having an appetite and my insides not really knowing where they should be ….”
Sensory changes
“I also have double vision … I can’t read … I can’t even watch telly … it’s like being in prison.”
Muscle weakness
“The most difficult bit was … I felt it took forever before I regained my strength. I just deposited my physical strength at the
hospital and I still feel it. I mean, I don’t feel I am up to my usual strength yet … I feel that I need more strength to open the
lid of a jar of jam. I was actually quite strong before I got sick.”
Sleep disturbances
1. “I slept so badly, I had these awful dreams, really horrible …”; “It’s incredible to wake up all of a sudden only to find that,
well, everything’s OK, and you wake up anyway just to check …”
2. “I’m sleeping really badly, I wake up often, I only sleep in small bits, it’s true that my sleep is not doing me good.”

 after hospital discharge were extracted from studies and
then categorized using the PROMIS domains of patient
outcomes: global satisfaction with life, mental health,
physical health, social health, and ability to participate in
social roles and activities. Our findings indicate that ICU
survivors experience impairments unique to their critical
illness across all domains of PROMIS.
PICS, developed as part of a 2010 stakeholder confer-
ence based on existing literature and discussion/consult-
ation among multidisciplinary experts and patient/family
representatives [7], is an effort to raise awareness of the
range of sequelae faced by survivors of critical illness.
PICS specifically considered physical, cognitive, and
mental health impairments [7]. The findings of this sys-
tematic review of qualitative studies clearly support the
mental health and physical impairments that are part of
PICS. However, none of the eligible studies in our sys-
tematic review explicitly reported a theme related to
cognitive functioning, in contrast to the wealth of data
reported in quantitative studies [52, 53]. This may be a
limitation of previous qualitative research, or a result of
the study selection criteria for this systematic review.
In addition to affirming the domains included in PICS,
our findings highlight the importance of a social health
domain. The theme of social health includes social func-
tioning and ability to participate in social roles and activ-
ities. According to the PROMIS definition, “Social health
encompasses participation in activities with others, carry-
ing out one’s usual roles and responsibilities, and relation-
ships and connections with important others” [54, 55].
This theme was less frequently reported than themes re-
lated to global satisfaction with life and to mental and
physical health. Some quantitative studies have demon-
strated significantly lower quality of life in ICU survivors
compared with the general population [10, 56–58], which
may persist over time [58, 59]. Social health may be an im-
portant contributing factor to impaired quality of life [60].
However, characterizing the social impact of critical illness
can be challenging using quantitative tools [61], and this
may be a reason for not including social health in quanti-
tative studies evaluating impairments following critical ill-
ness [3]. Social function is only assessed by two questions
in the Short Form-36 version 2 health survey (SF-36 v2)
and is not assessed by the EQ-5D survey, two of the most
common tools used to quantify quality of life [14, 62]. A
study of 980 ICU survivors showed significant correlation
between social integration level (measured by the Avail-
ability
of
Social
Integration
instrument)
and
SF-36
quality-of-life outcomes, with this correlation not present
in matched controls [63]. Although the PROMIS outcome
measures for social health have not yet been used in ICU
survivors, findings from our systematic review highlight
this domain for consideration in future research (Table 5).
Domains related to mental health and physical health
were well represented in our findings. These domains
are also well recognized by quantitative studies of ICU
survivors, which demonstrate high prevalence of symp-
toms of depression [64] and post-traumatic stress dis-
order [4], as well as physical disability [5, 8, 9]. Our
findings echo those from quantitative studies, highlight-
ing the high prevalence of these sequelae and their great
impact on patients’ overall wellbeing.
Our findings also highlight the range of positive emo-
tions patients may experience following critical illness,
which included positive outlook, acceptance, gratitude,
and independence. These findings demonstrate the im-
portance of appropriate coping mechanisms for patients
following critical illness to promote a positive life out-
look. The importance of coping in response to life events
and related stress is well recognized [65], and positive
coping skills have a strong association with improved
quality of life in other patient populations [66, 67].
Hence, strategies to improve coping skills may help im-
prove patient outcomes following critical illness [68, 69].
Our critical appraisal of eligible studies showed that
most of them used rigorous methods for recording and
coding qualitative data. However, there were important
gaps related to a lack of reporting on patient selection,
sample size justification, and use of a structured inter-
view guide (Additional file 1: Table S2). Utilizing a stan-
dardized framework for reporting qualitative research is
essential for comparing studies to draw meaningful con-
clusions [26]. Furthermore, it is critical to assist with
replication and transparency of methods.
Table 5 Qualitative themes of social health and ability to participate in social roles and activities
Theme
Example quote(s)
Social roles, activities, or relationships
Changes in friends or family
relationships
1. “I’m happy being back home, but I feel that my kids do not need me anymore. They use to take my opinion in
every aspect of their lives, I can’t find this anymore. Now they consult their mother, and act as if I’m still in
hospital.”
2. “… since the accident I don’t socialize as much as I used to … If you go out with friends you know, two years
down the line, they don’t want to be talking about your illness.”
Ability to participate in social roles and activities
Hobbies
“It was important for me to get back to a normal life, to paint or put up wallpaper or other stuff like that …”
Disability
“I was a mechanic … I can’t do it now. I’m not allowed to drive a car or get on a plane, they won’t let me do anything.”

 These findings can help inform future research aimed
at ensuring a patient-centered approach in evaluating
the impact of critical illness, as emphasized in recently
developed initiatives such as PROMIS and the Patient-
Centered Outcomes Research Institute [70]. The find-
ings of this systematic review also can contribute to
ensuring appropriate patient-centered domains are in-
cluded in a core outcome set for evaluating ICU survi-
vors’ outcomes after hospital discharge [12, 71–73] and
may be useful to consider in future revisions of PICS.
There are potential limitations to this systematic review.
First, it is important to note that many of the studies in-
cluded in our review did not report methods related to ap-
propriate patient sampling, data saturation, or inter-rater
comparisons; therefore, our inferences may be limited by
these issues. Second, the eligible studies were heteroge-
neous in the methods used to collect and analyze the quali-
tative data, which might have limited our ability to
synthesize findings across studies. However, our data repre-
sent 10 different countries, providing some evidence re-
garding the shared global impact of critical illness. Given
that our study used the PROMIS framework to categorize
themes, our ability to perform a meta-synthesis of the find-
ings may have been limited [74]. However, we used the
PROMIS framework to categorize themes since it is fre-
quently used to understand patient outcomes across many
chronic diseases [54]. Lastly, all attempts were made to
identify and include all relevant studies; however, poten-
tially relevant studies may have been inadvertently omitted.
Conclusion
This systematic review of qualitative studies evaluating
survivors of critical illness after hospital discharge dem-
onstrates that some may experience positive emotions
(e.g., acceptance, gratitude, and positive outlook). How-
ever, many survivors face a wide range of mental, physical,
and social sequelae with impaired life satisfaction. These
findings are important in helping focus on patient-
centered outcomes for studies aimed at improving the
status of survivors of critical illness, and in refining ran-
domized controlled trials in the field by identifying pa-
tients’ perspectives on outcomes and considering potential
interventions to address these needs.
