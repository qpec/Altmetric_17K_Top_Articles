Polymers, lipids, scaffolds, microneedles, and other biomaterials are rapidly emerging as 
technologies to improve the efficacy of vaccines against infectious disease and 
immunotherapies for cancer, autoimmunity, and transplantation. New studies are also 
providing insight into the interactions between these materials and the immune system. This 
insight can be exploited for more efficient design of vaccines and immunotherapies. Here, 
we describe recent advances made possible through the unique features of biomaterials, as 
well as the important questions for further study.
Biomaterials Offer Features That Improve Control of Responses to 
Vaccines and Immunotherapy
Despite the past advances of vaccines and immunotherapies, there is an increasing need for 
greater control over the types of immune responses generated to combat infection, cancer, 
and autoimmunity. Biomaterials – a term encompassing synthetic and natural polymers, 
lipids, self-assembled nanostructures, and engineered artificial cells – offer unique features 
to enable this control [1,2]. Some of the broad classes of biomaterials include: (i) nano-
particles (NPs) and microparticles (MPs) formed from polymers or lipids that can be

 conjugated or delivered to immune cells [3,4]; (ii) stable or degradable scaffolds for 
implantation [5]; and (iii) devices such as microneedle arrays that target immune cells in the 
skin [6,7]. Biomaterials are already used extensively in humans for prosthetics and implants, 
but to date, there are few clinical examples in the drug delivery field, and fewer still within 
vaccines and immunotherapy. Biomaterials offer key design benefits such as control over the 
loading and release kinetics of multiple immune cargos, and protection from enzymatic 
degradation and extreme pH. Furthermore, biomaterials can be conjugated with antibodies 
or receptor ligands to provide molecularly specific targeting to immune cells or tissues; this 
feature can be exploited to reduce systemic and local toxicity. The main classes of materials 
and unique features are summarized in Figure 1, while Table 1 highlights the key examples 
we discuss below.
MPs and NPs can be synthesized from either organic or inorganic materials. Liposomes, for 
example, are NPs composed of amphipathic lipid molecules surrounding an inner aqueous 
core (Figure 1A). They have thus far resulted in the most clinically approved drug delivery 
applications incorporating biomaterials, including chemotherapeutics such as Doxil/Myocet 
(liposomal doxorubicin), and liposomal vaccines such as Epaxal (hepatitis A) and Inflexal V 
(influenza). Liposomes are useful owing to biocompatibility, the ability to incorporate 
hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, and robust options for functionalization [8]. Degradable 
synthetic polymers such as poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) are also widely used in MPs 
and NPs because the chemistry of these polymers allows flexible control of the degradation 
profiles and resulting release of immune cargos (Figure 1B). Lipid and polymer particles can 
also be modified with reactive groups to trigger release in response to light, pH, or other 
cues. Interestingly, recent research reveals that PLGA and many other biomaterials exhibit 
physico-chemical features (e.g., charge, and repetitive chemical motifs) that can directly 
activate immune pathways [9,10]. These findings of intrinsic immunogenicity have 
catalyzed research to elucidate how material properties activate, modulate, or suppress 
immune pathways, for example, through interaction with Toll-like receptors (TLRs), 
inflammasomes, or other pathogen sensors. This concept could enable next generation 
materials that are not just carriers, but also actively direct the responses to the other 
components (e.g., antigens) of a vaccine or immunotherapy.
From another perspective, the intrinsic immunogenic features of biomaterials can also 
complicate design because the carriers may adversely alter the response of the immune 
system to other components. Thus, an emerging area of research focuses on self-assembly of 
proteins, nucleic acid ligands, or other immune signals into structures that mimic attractive 
features of biomaterials (e.g., co-delivery), but that are comprised entirely from immune 
signals [11– 13] (Figure 1C). Self-assembly can also be applied to the synthesis of scaffolds 
for targeted delivery of immune signals and drugs, or for integration of synthetic materials 
that create microenvironments to recruit immune cells to target sites (Figure 1D). Lastly, 
new studies are exploiting delivery devices such as microneedles, microscale metal or 
polymer needles that target skin-resident immune cells without penetrating the skin deeply 
enough to cause pain (Figure 1E). Microneedles also eliminate medical sharps and provide 
increased thermal stability, a feature crucial for effective distribution of vaccines in 
developing regions with limited refrigeration.

 In this review, we highlight ways in which biomaterials can be leveraged to improve 
vaccines and immunotherapies. We begin with a discussion of the intrinsic immunogenicity 
of biomaterials in relation to their shape, size, and chemistry. Next, we describe how 
biomaterials are being tested as vaccines and immunotherapies in infection, cancer, 
autoimmunity, allergies, and transplantation. We also frame the central concepts biomaterials 
are being used for in the context of the respective tissues and immunological sites they are 
applied. Interested readers are directed to several texts for a more comprehensive 
background on biomaterials [14] and immunology [15].
Biomaterials Exhibit Physicochemical Properties That Can Trigger or Block 
Immune Pathways
Shape Effects
As alluded to above, shape can alter interaction with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) or 
other immune cells, even in the absence of other immune signals. Several studies reveal 
ellipsoidal particles improve pharmacokinetics compared to spherical particles, enhancing 
circulation time to promote immunity [16– 18]. For example, ellipsoidal PLGA particles 
functionalized with peptide– MHC complex and anti-CD28 on the surface can mimic 
antigen presentation by APCs to stimulate T cells more effectively than spherical particles 
owing to increased interaction with T cells (Figure 2A, top). However, these interactions 
may vary across cell types; NP uptake by macrophages appears biased toward spherical 
particles, whereas ellipsoidal particles resist uptake [16,19].
Size Effects
Biomaterial particles can vary in size on the order of nanometers to microns or larger. While 
NPs up to several 100 nm, particularly those ≥25 nm, traffic rapidly to draining lymph nodes 
(LNs), larger particles are retained at the site of injection and are internalized and 
transported to LNs by APCs [9,20]. Recent work reveals pulmonary APCs [macrophages 
and dendritic cells (DCs)] take up 50 nm polystyrene particles more efficiently and rapidly 
compared to 500 nm particles [21]. Notably, APCs that take up 50 nm polystyrene particles 
also had greater expression of co-stimulatory markers compared to 500 nm particles, due to 
preferential uptake by several DC subsets that facilitates greater cell-mediated transport to 
draining LNs. However, 500 nm particles resulted in a nearly twofold increase in uptake by 
alveolar macrophages, suggesting the ability of larger particles to persist at a site and 
accumulate in cells. In other studies using antigen-coated polystyrene rods and spheres of 
different sizes, smaller sizes promoted T helper (Th)1 biased response in the case of the 
spherical geometries. Conversely, for rod-shaped particles, increasing length, but not width, 
correlated with a Th2 biased response [22]; possibly because longer particles presented a 
greater antigen density and surface area for attachment or internalization. Together, these 
results highlight the importance of particle size in trafficking, uptake by APCs, activation, 
and subsequent biasing of adaptive response (Figure 2A, center). This interplay between 
size, shape, and chemical features (discussed below) also underscores a key outstanding 
question: how best to isolate the role of specific material properties (e.g., shape vs. surface 
area) to enable more rational design of smart vaccine and immunotherapy carriers.

 Chemistry Effects
The chemistry of a material impacts intrinsic immunogenic activity, thus, chemistry can be 
used as a lever to control this parameter [23,24]. For example, the hydrophobicity of gold 
NPs designed with specific functional groups alters the expression of genes for interleukin 
(IL)-2, -6, -10, tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ in vitro and in mice [23]. Surface 
charge can also influence APC function, for example, negatively charged particles can 
reduce uptake by APCs, and as a consequence, restrain adaptive immune responses [25]. 
Although in this work negative surface charge was insufficient to induce tolerance, 
negatively charged materials may be useful in designing nonimmunogenic carrier platforms. 
Another consideration is the stability of a particle, as many nanomaterials exist as 
suspensions that can aggregate with time. In one example, iron NPs formed aggregates that 
were internalized by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro at greater rates compared to 
stable suspensions; this change increased TLR signaling, complement activation, and IL-1β 
production [26]. Additionally, while degradable materials are often used to control the 
release rates of antigens or other vaccine components, recent studies show the intrinsic 
immunogenicity of polymers can change over time as polymers degrade and the 
physicochemical properties change. In one example using a common class of degradable 
polymers, poly (β-amino esters), particle size and charge changed as molecular weight 
decreased. Regardless of the starting polymer structure, the material-driven immunogenicity 
peaked at a characteristic molecular weight range [27,28]. Thus, surface chemistry is 
important in rational design of biomaterials and presents new opportunities to tailor the 
types of responses elicited (Figure 2A, bottom).
Biomaterials Can Improve Immunogenicity and Durability of Vaccines 
against Infectious Disease
While vaccines for infectious disease have already been transformative, biomaterials are 
being investigated to improve immunogenicity and durability, and to make design and 
delivery of antigens and adjuvants more efficient. Biomaterials can also increase stability to 
enable the use of antigens that are difficult to work with, serve as delivery technologies that 
increase shelf-life for distribution in developing regions, and offer improved compliance 
through simpler, less painful delivery routes.
Biomaterial Vaccines against Model Antigens
Many material platforms are initially investigated with model antigens to establish concepts 
that can be extended to disease-relevant antigens. Encapsulation of vaccine cargo into 
polymeric or lipid particles is a continuing theme in the vaccine field to improve co-delivery 
of antigen and adjuvant, or achieve desirable delivery kinetics through controlled cargo 
release (Figure 2B). The particulate nature of material platforms also generally enhances 
uptake by APCs [29– 31]. One recent example used crosslinked lipid NPs encapsulating 
model antigen (ovalbumin; Ova) combined with a TLR agonist (TLRa) to increase antigen-
specific T cells 13-fold by increasing retention in draining LNs [31]. Particles can also be 
engineered to be porous, increasing cargo loading density compared to traditional solid 
particles, while maintaining attractive features such as uniform particles with tunable sizes

 [32]. Porosity can also increase the diffusion of intracellular proteases, resulting in faster 
processing and presentation of antigen. This idea has been used to co-deliver two types of 
pattern recognition receptors, TLRas and NOD-like receptor agonists (NLRa), along with 
Ova, in porous silica particles [33]. In mice, these coloaded particles polarized responses 
toward Th1 function without CD8+ T cell activation, in comparison to delivery of the 
individual agonists.
Another new approach involves electrostatic assembly of cationic and anionic immune 
signals onto a template that can later be removed to create carrier free vaccine capsules. 
These self-assembled materials, termed immune polyelectrolyte multilayers (iPEMs), are 
composed entirely of antigens, nucleic-acid based adjuvants, or other charged immune 
signals [13]. Coating a sacrificial core with Ova peptide appended with cationic amino acid 
and RNA-based TLRas created an approach to control the absolute and relative loadings of 
each component. In mice, iPEMs improved expansion of antigen-specific T cells and 
provided protection during a melanoma model expressing Ova [34]. This carrier-free 
approach also eliminates any complicating factors arising from the intrinsic immunogenicity 
of biomaterials discussed above.
The studies above and others highlight the benefits of using biomaterials to co-deliver 
signals [35], but there are many open questions as to the commonality of design needs across 
vaccines and immunological targets. For example, another recent study showed delivering 
signals in separate NPs generates efficacious responses compared to co-delivery of antigen 
and adjuvant in the same polymer particle [36]. This dichotomy might result from a 
competing effects between potency resulting from coactivation of multiple pathways in an 
individual cell (i. e., cargo in the same particle), compared with activating fewer pathways in 
a greater number of cells (i.e., cargo in different particles).
In addition to co-delivery, biomaterials can be used to create scaffolds that control the 
context and valency in which immune signals are presented (Figure 2C). In one approach, a 
TLRa was conjugated to a polymer scaffold to improve the unfavorable pharmacokinetic 
properties associated with delivery of soluble TLRas in clinical applications [37]. Depending 
on the density of TLRa on the polymer backbone and temperature (i.e., physiological and 
ambient), adjuvant distribution and retention time in draining LNs could be controlled. This 
control enhanced uptake and innate immune activation. Scaffolds are also a useful tool to 
modulate host cell populations because they provide spatiotemporal control of chemical and 
mechanical signals. This idea has been used to control DC recruitment and subsequent 
homing to draining LNs by loading scaffolds built from porous silica rods with Ova, 
granulocyte– macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and TLRa [38]. These 
materials provide a large pore volume and large surface area for controlled cargo release, 
while creating a 3D microenvironment to recruit and program DCs that then traffic to the 
draining LN. Compared to nonporous and soluble controls, this approach increased systemic 
antibody and cytotoxic T cell levels, delayed tumor growth, and increased survival in a 
mouse model of EG7.OVA lymphoma. The concepts illustrated in this section using model 
antigen are readily adaptable to the more clinically relevant models below.

 Biomaterial Vaccines for HIV
Biomaterials have recently been investigated as options to increase the efficacy of candidate 
HIV therapies in mice and rhesus macaques. Liposomes, for example, have been used to 
deliver a HIV viral envelope protein to increase lymphatic uptake and retention, and increase 
antigen capture by APCs. Liposomal delivery enabled co-delivery of TLR agonists and T 
cell helper epitopes with tunable protein density to enhance the strength and durability of 
antibody responses in mice [39]. The tunability was used to promote B cell receptor 
aggregation, thus enhancing cross presentation. Another emerging approach is attachment of 
NPs loaded with modulatory immune cues to T cells or APCs to alter their function during 
vaccination or immunotherapy (Figure 2D). This idea has been used to improve cytotoxic T 
cell recognition of infected target cells in a mouse model of HIV by chemically conjugating 
antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell lymphocytes (CTLs) with NPs loaded with IL-15Sa; a 
dimer of IL-15 and IL-15Ra [40].
Biomaterial Vaccines against Influenza
Influenza has a well-established vaccine, but biomaterials are being investigated for next 
generation versions that protect against evolving strains, eliminate the need for annual 
redesign, or improve patient compliance. PLGA NPs, for example, are being tested in pigs to 
induce cross-protection against evolving swine flu virus because they can encapsulate and 
protect inactivated viral antigens and controllably release cargo [41]. Additionally, PLGA 
NPs co-delivering whole virus antigen and multiple TLRas (TLR4a and TLR7a) have been 
used to elicit robust immunity against H1N1 influenza in rhesus macaques [35]. NPs built 
from influenza antigens through self-assembly have also been used to ensure display in the 
native conformations to drive cross-protection [42].
Another promising strategy recently entering the clinic is delivery of vaccine components 
using microneedles (Figure 2E). A new first-in-human trial using dissolvable microneedle 
patches for influenza vaccination revealed the vaccines were stable for more than 1 year and 
generated titers similar to those of existing injectable vaccines even when self-administered 
by recipients [43– 45]. Such advances could transform the way vaccines are delivered, as 
well as the accessibility of effective formulations in developing regions. Not surprising, 
microneedles are also being explored as vaccines for HIV [46,47].
Biomaterials Targeting Other Infectious Diseases
Other infectious diseases being targeted by biomaterial-based approaches include 
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, where PLGA NPs are being tested to combat 
antibiotic resistance [48]. One candidate vaccine against Chlamydia trachomatis – a 
common sexually transmitted disease with no vaccine – involves pH-responsive polymers 
and TLRas linked to UV-inactivated C. trachomatis [49]. This approach provides control 
over how antigen and adjuvant is processed during uptake and endosomal acidification 
(Figure 2F,G, middle), enhancing endosomal TLR signaling and driving long-lived 
protection in a humanized mouse challenge model. Similarly, responsive cationic polymers 
are being studied to improve the immunogenicity of candidate vaccines for Zika virus [50] 
and pneumococcal disease [51]. Together, these examples illustrate another emerging trend: 
Bookstaver et al.

 biomaterials can be exploited to control the context in which immune signals are presented, 
or the tissues and subcellular organelles the signals reach.
Biomaterials Improve Targeting, Selectivity, and Potency of 
Immunotherapies to Fight Cancer
Many of the capabilities that make biomaterials attractive for vaccines against infectious 
disease are also being investigated to combat cancer. Some of these include: (i) co-delivery; 
(ii) targeted delivery; (iii) enhancement of adoptive transfer; and (iv) improved efficacy and 
safety of existing treatments. Several studies are using OVA-expressing tumor models to 
understand how biomaterial chemistry and tumor antigen display impact antitumor 
immunity [52,53], while others are translationally focused, targeting specific cancers.
Biomaterial Therapies for Leukemia and Lymphoma
An exciting strategy arising with biomaterials in cancer is conjugation of T cells with NPs 
incorporating immune cues to enhance antitumor response. In one example, NPs loaded with 
chemotherapeutics were conjugated to autologous T cells ex vivo, then adoptively 
transferred into a mouse with disseminated lymphoma [54]. This strategy reduced tumor 
burden by targeting the chemotherapy to the lymphoid sites where the T cells and 
lymphomas home; thus, the NP served as a drug depot for controlled and sustained release 
to the T cell. Other approaches seek to eliminate adoptive transfer entirely. For example, in a 
mouse model of leukemia, cationic polymers have been used to condense DNA encoding 
leukemia-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) [55]. The NPs were then functionalized 
with anti-CD3 fragments to target T cells, inducing expression of the CAR gene in situ and 
providing long-term disease remission. Such approaches could lead to efficient and effective 
routes for analogous outcomes in the clinic.
Biomaterial Vaccines for Melanoma
Owing to the simplicity and accessibility of mouse models, melanoma remains the most 
common cancer model in which biomaterial vaccines and immunotherapies are tested. 
Implantable scaffolds are one key example, as scaffolds can create local depots to recruit 
immune cells, or modulate their function [56]. Tumor cells, TLRas, and recruitment factors 
(e.g., GM-CSF) can be coencapsulated in porous polymer gels to recruit DCs to mount 
durable, tumor-specific T cell responses in mice [57]. Alternatively, other scaffolds have 
been loaded with CAR T cells for direct targeting to solid tumors [58]. In another approach, 
live attenuated bacteria were modified with self-assembled NPs containing DNA encoding 
antiangiogenic factors. The bacteria served as an adjuvant to activate T cells, while the DNA 
restrained angiogenesis [59].
Self-assembly is also another theme being exploited in cancer. For example, iPEMs built on 
microneedles using melanoma peptides and TLRas have been used for delivery to the 
immune-rich dermal layer in mice to generate melanoma-specific T cells [60]. In another 
approach, spontaneous micelle vaccines composed of tumor peptides and synthetic polymers 
that activate STING (stimulator of interferon gene) signaling generated strong antitumor

 inhibition in multiple mouse models [61]. In particular, these examples underscore the theme 
that carriers can be engineered to also actively trigger desirable immune pathways.
A number of co-delivery applications also focus on delivery of immunomodulatory cues 
during cancer vaccination and immunotherapy to tailor immune response. In one approach, 
PLGA MPs loaded with rapamycin could be used to control the polarization of T cells 
between effector or memory phenotypes, depending on the level of drug in the particles 
during tumor vaccination [62]. In another report, lipoprotein-mimicking NPs coupled with 
personalized sets of tumor peptides and adjuvants enhanced uptake and processing by APCs, 
generating broad specificity T cell responses that inhibited tumor growth in mice that was 
not achieved without co-delivery [63].
As in the STING example above, an emerging theme is to co-opt existing immune pathways 
to enhance vaccines and immunotherapies. One exciting biomaterials example coupled 
amphiphilic vaccines comprised of antigen and adjuvant with an albumin-binding domain 
that efficiently shuttled vaccine components to LNs through natural albumin trafficking 
mechanisms [64]. Another approach demonstrated effective eradication of large tumors 
through LN targeting and combinatorial activation of both innate and adaptive immune 
responses using a four-part vaccine: tumor-antigen targeting antibody, recombinant IL-2, 
anti-PD-1 (a checkpoint inhibitor), and the vaccine antigen [65]. Lastly, artificial APCs 
composed of PLGA particles functionalized with anti-CD28 and MHC displaying tumor 
antigen have been designed to activate T cells [66]. When combined with checkpoint 
blockade during a metastatic mouse model of melanoma, this therapy synergistically 
suppressed tumor growth.
Biomaterials can also provide targeting that reduces systemic toxicity and provides dose 
sparing. This idea has increased the efficacy of candidate immunotherapies involving whole 
tumor cell lysates through improved targeting to DCs [65,67]. Biomaterials have also been 
used to increase the efficacy of checkpoint blockade therapies by better selective targeting to 
specific cell types, decreasing systemic side effects [68,69]. Only now are some of these 
ideas filtering into clinical trials [70], highlighting the need to use more rigorous preclinical 
models in testing biomaterials and to push toward clinical studies.
Biomaterial Immunotherapies for Breast Cancer
In breast cancer, one recent approach used NPs as substrates to create bispecific conjugates 
that exploited epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and calreticulin-mediated 
phagocytosis signaling to bring cancer cells and immune cells together. This approach 
facilitated phagocytosis and resulted in eradication of HER2-expressing tumors in mice [71]. 
Another strategy used biomaterials and photothermal therapy to ablate tumors in mice, 
providing APCs access to tumor associated antigens (Figure 2G). Photothermal therapy 
works through local absorption of energy from a laser by nanoparticles draining into a tumor 
to generate local heating. Importantly, encapsulating TLRa in the NPs with a photothermal 
agent enhanced the tumor specific immune response and generated functional effector 
memory that protected against tumor rechallenge [72].

 As with melanoma, scaffold implants are being investigated to increase the efficacy of 
adoptive T cell therapy in breast cancer. In one design, porous polymer implants integrate a 
synthetic collagen-mimetic peptide, IL-15 superagonist, and membrane-bound ligands 
coupling anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and anti-CD137 antibodies. When implanted in a mouse 
breast cancer resection model, these implants led to increased T cell proliferation, biased 
toward memory phenotypes, and prevented tumor relapse [73]. Such approaches could 
support treatment of inoperable and incompletely removed tumors because scaffolds can be 
placed directly at the resection site to serve as a depot.
Biomaterials Can Promote Tolerance in Autoimmunity, Allergies, and Transplantation
In addition to driving proinflammatory responses as above, biomaterials are also emerging 
as a powerful tool to promote regulatory responses for tolerance. Dysregulation in tolerance 
can lead to autoimmune disease – where self-molecules are attacked, allergies, and rejection 
of transplants. Generally, the treatments for these conditions are immunosuppressants, or 
slow build-up of tolerance with sensitization (e.g., for allergies). While these approaches are 
beneficial, they are generally nonspecific, have off target effects, or require life-long 
treatment. For example, in multiple sclerosis (MS) – a disease in which myelin lining the 
central nervous system is attacked, even monoclonal antibodies do not distinguish between 
healthy and self-reactive immune cells. Thus, treatments are not curative and can leave 
patients immunocompromised. In this final area of review, there are two general approaches: 
(i) use of biomaterials to change how self-antigens are processed; and (ii) co-delivery of 
self-antigens with cues that alter the response to self-antigen. Below we discuss how 
biomaterials are being used in model tolerance systems, and in disease models of MS, 
diabetes, allergies, and transplantation.
Biomaterials to Promote Tolerance in Model Systems
Model systems of tolerance are being used to generate insights that can then be applied to 
different diseases [74]. In one example, PLGA NPs were used for intravenous and 
subcutaneous delivery of rapamycin to induce tolerance against coadministered model 
antigens [75]. These NPs targeted rapamycin selectively to APCs, in contrast to free 
rapamycin that was distributed systemically, acting on multiple cell types. Importantly, this 
work demonstrated an effective and safe way to induce antigen-specific tolerance in mice 
and nonhuman primates. Knowledge gained using biomaterials in model platforms provides 
the basis for expansion to disease models.
Biomaterial Immunotherapies in Mouse Models of MS
Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and relapsing-remitting (RR)-EAE are 
common mouse models of progressive- and RR-MS, respectively. In several recent reports, 
particles are used to deliver self-antigens to promote tolerance by changing how they are 
processed or the cells internalizing the particles [76– 79]. In particular, self-antigen 
encapsulated or displayed on NPs can enhance the trafflcking of these antigens to domains 
in LNs or spleen where APCs expressing scavenger receptors reside (Figure 2H). The 
hypothesis is that antigens engaging these receptors are processed through tolerogenic 
pathways associated with clearance of apoptotic host cell debris, against which tolerance is 
generally desired. In a variety of autoimmune models, this approach reverses or eliminates

 disease – paralysis, in the case of EAE. Self-antigens have also been conjugated to red blood 
cells, which are normally recycled at high rates, and thus also prone to clearance through 
protolerogenic pathways [80,81].
Understanding the specific design features that lead to tolerance is important in moving from 
empirical methodologies to rational design. Recently, monodispersed quantum dots (QDs) 
were used to demonstrate that the density at which self-antigen is displayed on NPs 
correlates with the degree of tolerance, even when the total number of self-peptides is fixed 
[79]. In particular, mice with EAE exhibit greater therapeutic effects when infused with a 
higher number of QDs displaying lower densities of self-antigen compared with fewer QDs 
each displaying a higher density of self-antigen. In a different mechanistic study, NPs coated 
with self-antigens bound to MHC-II molecules were used to directly engage T cell receptors 
(i.e., without APC interaction) [82,83]. This approach expanded antigen-specific T 
regulatory (Treg) cell levels in mouse models of MS, diabetes, and arthritis. Importantly, the 
work revealed molecular features impacting T cell fate, with the dose of peptide: MHC 
controlling the degree of T cell expansion, while the density of the complexes on the NP 
surface dictated the extent of polarization to Treg cells [83]. Thus for both strategies 
targeting APCs [79] or T cells [83], design features such as display density play a crucial 
role – parameters difficult or impossible to control with traditional therapies.
Biomaterials can also be exploited to co-deliver cues with self-antigens to alter the antigen-
specific immune response [84,85]. Recently, intra-LN injection of polymeric particles 
encapsulating self-antigen was used to study tolerance with respect to the local structure and 
function of the LN microenvironment [78]. Treatments with particles coencapsulating self-
antigen and rapamycin led to local reorganization of treated nodes, as well as other distant 
nodes, systemic expansion of Treg cells, and permanent reversal of paralysis in mice with 
EAE. Thus, local reprogramming of the LN environment led to tolerance that was systemic, 
but antigen-specific. Self-assembly has been used for co-delivery as well, promoting 
tolerance with carrier-free vaccines that eliminate the intrinsic immunogenic effects of 
biomaterials discussed earlier [86,87]. TLR signaling is overactive in many human 
autoimmune diseases, yet bio-materials can activate TLRs. In one study, iPEM capsules, 
built from self-antigen and regulatory antagonists of TLR signaling, eradicated paralysis in 
mice during EAE, and, in samples from human MS patients, reduced myelin-specific 
inflammatory responses [86].
Biomaterial Immunotherapies for Allergies
Immunotherapies, such as allergy shots, are already established in treating allergies. 
However, frequent trips to a physician’s office are required, and treatment is slow, 
sometimes ineffective, and difficult to pinpoint to specific antigens. Particle encapsulation is 
being investigated because it offers a controlled release platform to reduce adverse reactions 
to concentrated allergens and allow for coencapsulation of other immune cargos to direct the 
response away from hypersensitivity [88– 90]. These approaches use many strategies already 
discussed, with one theme emerging as polarization of T cell response away from Th2 
responses to allergens.

 Biomaterial Immunotherapies for Diabetes
Clinically, diabetes is often treated with frequent insulin injections, but several biomaterial 
approaches are being tested, particularly for type 1 diabetes. In one strategy a hybrid 
scaffold-particle encapsulated denatured insulin antigen and a peptide hydrogel containing 
GM-CSF [91]. This hybrid system reduced type 1 diabetes in mice compared to controls; 
possibly through establishment of a microenvironment that recruits and expands immune 
cells in granulomas observed during treatment. Using platforms discussed earlier, disease-
associated antigens linked to red blood cells can maintain normoglycemia in a mouse model 
of type 1 diabetes [80,81], while NPs displaying peptide: MHC complexes potently 
expanded antigen specific Treg cells to control diabetes in mice [82].
Biomaterial Immunotherapies for Transplantation
Similar to treatments for autoimmune diseases, transplant rejection is treated with 
immunosuppressive drugs that cause systemic side effects. Several material platforms 
involve co-delivering replacement tissue or cells with immunomodulatory factors before or 
during transplantation, or using materials for immune isolation [92,93]. Recently, scaffolds 
have been used to target immune signals and drugs [94– 96]. For example, a self-assembled 
hydrogel loaded with immunosuppressant was used for triggered release in response to 
proteolytic enzymes overexpressed during inflammation. Relative to soluble drug, injection 
of the hydrogel sustained drug levels in tissue and increased vascular allograft survival in 
mice [95]. No evidence of systemic toxicity was observed with either formulation. Other 
work has loaded peptide antigens in PLG NPs to improve long-term engraftment of bone 
marrow in mice by changing how the antigen is processed [97], while MPs containing an 
immunosuppressive drug have been coated with LN-targeting antibodies to prolong survival 
in a heart allograft model [98].
Concluding Remarks
Biomaterials offer unique opportunities compared with existing vaccines and 
immunotherapies. However questions remain (see Outstanding Questions): can biomaterials 
eliminate the need for multiple vaccinations through controlled cargo release? What are the 
long-term effects of biomaterials on disease development and progression as these materials 
persist and degrade to specific byproducts, and are there considerations with respect to 
multiple exposures across a lifetime? Furthermore, it remains unclear how readily 
biomaterial vaccines and immunotherapies can be extended to humans, from the mouse 
models used in most studies. The impact of physicochemical properties of materials on 
specific immune pathways must also be developed. Still, biomaterials allow better control 
over responses to antigens, adjuvants, or immunomodulators and can be used to target these 
cues to particular tissues or cell populations, or to modify immune cells or pathogens. Each 
of these ideas are being explored across infectious disease, cancer, and tolerance, 
highlighting one final feature of biomaterials – they are platform technologies for extension 
to a variety of diseases. An important goal is to develop the fundamental understanding 
needed to create design rules for selecting materials that enable efficient, rational strategies 
that accelerate translation to the clinic.

 Outstanding Questions
How can the physicochemical properties of biomaterials be effectively decoupled 
to create design rules for different applications?
Can the need for multiple vaccination and booster injections be eliminated through 
slowly degrading biomaterials?
How can biomaterials be used to enable more rational approaches to vaccine and 
immunotherapy design?
How readily can biomaterial platforms be scaled up for use in large animals and 
humans, and how can the need for this effort be broadly encouraged?
Are there long-term effects of biomaterials on disease development and 
progression?

 Trends
Biomaterials have intrinsic immunogenic features (size, shape, and chemistry) that 
can be harnessed to create carriers that actively direct responses to vaccines and 
immunotherapies, or to modify immune cell function in vivo.
Biomaterials can provide control over the combinations and relative 
concentrations of ligands to simultaneously target multiple immune populations 
and pathways, or to target these signals to specific cells, organelles, or tissues.
In addition to immunogenic properties, biomaterials can support decreased 
systemic effects and pain, improved cargo stability, and enable self-administration

 Figure 2. Strategies Involving Biomaterials for Engineering Immune Function
(A) Material shape, size, chemistry, and other physicochemical properties impact drainage 
through lymphatics, interactions with APCs, and the intrinsic immunogenicity of many 
common polymers. (B) Biomaterials can be used to control the combinations and relative 
concentrations of immune cargos reaching APCs and lymphocytes, or, by designing 
polymers with a desired degradation rate, the cargo delivery kinetics. (C) Scaffolds can be 
used to control the context or density in which antigens and adjuvants are displayed, and as 
local environments to recruit APCs or lymphocytes (e.g., by incorporation of chemokines). 
(D) T cells, APCs, and other immune cells can be modified with nanoparticles incorporating 
immune signals to exert autocrine effects on the modified cells, or to exert paracrine effects 
on target cells and tissue to which the modified cell will migrate (e.g., a tumor). (E) 
Microneedles coated with or incorporating immune cues increase safety and patient 
compliance by efficiently targeting skin-resident immune cells without pain, generation of 
medical sharps, or need for refrigeration. (F) Biomaterial carriers can be engineered with 
specific moieties to control cellular entry and intracellular trafficking for directing spatially 
restricted immune processes (e.g., TLR signaling and antigen processing). (G) Stimuli 
responsive materials can exploit physiological (e.g., changes in pH or temperature) or 
external cues (e.g., UV light) to provide environment-specific control within cells, target

responses away from proimmune and toward regulation. Abbreviations: APC, antigen-
presenting cell; MP, microparticle; NP, nanoparticle; TLR, Toll-like receptor.
