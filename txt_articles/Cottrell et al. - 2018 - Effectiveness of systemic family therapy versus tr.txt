Summary
Background Self-harm in adolescents is common and repetition occurs in a high proportion of these cases. Scarce 
evidence exists for effectiveness of interventions to reduce self-harm.
Methods This pragmatic, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial of family therapy versus treatment as usual was 
done at 40 UK Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) centres. We recruited young people aged 
11–17 years who had self-harmed at least twice and presented to CAMHS after self-harm. Participants were randomly 
assigned (1:1) to receive manualised family therapy delivered by trained and supervised family therapists or treatment 
as usual by local CAMHS. Participants and therapists were aware of treatment allocation; researchers were masked. 
The primary outcome was hospital attendance for repetition of self-harm in the 18 months after group assignment. 
Primary and safety analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered at the ISRCTN 
registry, number ISRCTN59793150.
Findings Between Nov 23, 2009, and Dec 31, 2013, 3554 young people were screened and 832 eligible young people 
consented to participation and were randomly assigned to receive family therapy (n=415) or treatment as usual 
(n=417). Primary outcome data were available for 795 (96%) participants. Numbers of hospital attendances for repeat 
self-harm events were not significantly different between the groups (118 [28%] in the family therapy group vs 
103 [25%] in the treatment as usual group; hazard ratio 1·14 [95% CI 0·87–1·49] p=0·33). Similar numbers of adverse 
events occurred in both groups (787 in the family therapy group vs 847 in the treatment as usual group).
Interpretation For adolescents referred to CAMHS after self-harm, having self-harmed at least once before, our family 
therapy intervention conferred no benefits over treatment as usual in reducing subsequent hospital attendance for 
self-harm. Clinicians are therefore still unable to recommend  a clear, evidence-based intervention to reduce repeated 
self-harm in adolescents.

Introduction
Self-harm in adolescents is a global public health 
problem, with 10% of adolescents self-reporting self-
harm within the past year1 and suicide the second 
commonest cause of death in young people aged 
10–24 years, after road traffic accidents.2 Self-harm in 
adolescents has serious consequences, and those who 
self-harm have a four times greater risk of death from 
any cause and a ten times greater risk of suicide than the 
general population,2–4 indicating potentially avoidably 
high burdens of life-years lost and family and peer 
distress. Non-fatal repetition occurs in 18% of people 
who self-harm, according to a recent large multicentre 
study in England.5
A single effective intervention has not been 
identified.6 A recent systematic review and meta-
analysis of 19 randomised controlled trials with 
2176 participants found a small overall effect of three 
specific interventions (dialectical behaviour therapy, 
mentalisation-based therapy, and cognitive behavioural 
therapy) on repetition of self-harm.7 Studies with strong 
family involvement and substantial treatment dose 
showed significant reductions in self-harm events.7–9 
A recent large, retro-spective, registry-based matched 
cohort study (n=5678) showed lower long-term risk of 
self-harm in people receiving psychosocial treatments 
compared with those who did not, but numbers needed 
to treat were large.10
Family factors (parent–child interaction, perceived 
support, expressed emotion, experience of abuse, 
parental conflict, and parental mental health) are 
important risk factors associated with self-harm in 
children and adolescents.11 Family therapy aims to draw 
on and mobilise the existing strengths and resources of 
the child and family and is therefore a logical potential 
intervention after self-harm.12

This trial, termed the Self-Harm Intervention: Family 
Therapy (SHIFT) trial, reports on a new form of family 
therapy intervention for self-harm. The trial was done in 
response to a call by the National Institute for Health 
Research Health Technology Assessment programme for 
a study investigating the clinical effectiveness and cost-
effectiveness of family therapy for adolescents who self-
harm (HTA 07/33). We aimed to assess the effectiveness 
of family therapy compared with treatment as usual in 
reducing self-harm repetition in young people.
Methods
Study design and participants
This study is a pragmatic, multicentre, individually 
randomised, controlled trial of family therapy versus 
treatment as usual, done at 40 UK National Health 
Service (NHS) Child and Adolescent Mental Health 
Services (CAMHS) in 15 NHS trusts in the UK across 
Greater Manchester, London, and Yorkshire. The study 
was approved by the UK NHS National Research Ethics 
Service in April, 2009 (09/H1307/20), and the protocol is 
published online.13
Eligible adolescents were aged 11–17 years, living with 
a primary caregiver (who was willing to take part), and 
had self-harmed at least twice before being referred to 
CAMHS for self-harm (index episode). If the self-harm 
event was caused by alcohol or recreational drugs, the 
young person had to have stated that they were 
intending self-harm by use of these substances. In 
common with UK, European, and Australian practice,2 
we defined self-harm as any form of intentional non-
fatal self-poisoning or self-injury (eg, cutting, taking 
excess medication, hanging, self-strangulation, jumping 
from height, and running into traffic) regardless of 
suicidal intent; this includes US definitions of non-
suicidal self-injury and suicidal behaviour. Exclusion 
criteria were serious risk of suicide, an ongoing child 
protection investigation in the family, pregnancy at time 
of trial entry, usual treatment by a specific specialist 
service within CAMHS, residence in a short-term foster 
home, moderate to severe learning disabilities, 
involvement in another study within the 6 months 
before entry into this trial, sibling participation in the 
trial or treatment with family therapy within CAMHS, 
and insufficient proficiency in English language of 
either the young person or caregiver to complete study 
questionnaires (appendix). All patients and carers gave 
written informed consent to participate in the trial.
Randomisation and masking

receive family therapy or treatment as usual (1:1) via a

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched electronic databases Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, 
and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for 
randomised controlled trials of interventions to address self-
harm in people younger than 18 years in which the primary 
outcome was reduction in self-harm. We included trials 
published up to March 31, 2007, in any language. Because of 
the varied nomenclature used in self-harm research, our search 
used several keywords for self-harm and associated behaviours 
as follows: “self-harm” OR “deliberate self-harm” OR “suicide” 
OR “attempted suicide” OR “overdose” OR “suicidal behaviour” 
OR “drug overdose” OR “self-poisoning” OR “self-injurious 
behaviour” OR “self-injury” OR, “non-suicidal self-injury” OR 
“self-destructive behaviour” OR “self-inflicted wounds” OR 
“self-mutilation” OR “suicidal ideation”. We screened abstracts 
to retrieve full-text articles for assessment of eligibility, and 
checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews for 
additional references.
We identified one trial of a token allowing readmission to 
hospital, which found no effect, and one trial of group therapy 
for adolescents, but no other studies in young people (aged 
18 years or younger) with a primary outcome of reduction in 
repetition of self-harm (subsequent replication of the group 
therapy study did not find a positive effect of group therapy). 
We identified two studies of family interventions related to 
self-harm, a study in people with depression that reported 
suicidal ideation as a secondary outcome, and a study of a 
home-based intervention designed to improve family 
communication, powered to detect between-group differences 
in suicidal ideation, not repeat self-harm.
Added value of the study
We found no evidence that, for adolescents referred to Child 
and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) for self-harm, 
having self-harmed at least once before, the trial’s manualised 
systemic family therapy conferred any benefits over treatment 
as usual in reducing subsequent hospital admission for self-
harm. Interpretation of health economic and secondary 
outcomes was limited by significant loss to follow-up, but our 
data suggest possible significant improvements in secondary 
clinical outcomes, such as extent of emotional and behavioural 
problems, and the possibility of cost-effectiveness when 
considering combined benefits to the caregiver and young 
person together.
Interpretation
For adolescents referred to CAMHS after self-harm, having 
self-harmed at least once before, SHIFT family therapy 
conferred no benefits over treatment as usual in reducing 
subsequent hospital attendance for self-harm. Young people 
who self-harm form a varied and heterogeneous group, and 
self-harm is likely to be the final common pathway for a wide 
range of problems. Further research is needed to develop a 
more personalised approach and to identify which 
interventions are most helpful for which young people.

computer-generated minimisation programme incorpor-
ating a random element. Stratification factors were centre 
(CAMHS teams); sex; age (11–14 years or 15–17 years); 
living arrangements (with parents or guardians vs long-
term foster care); previous self-harm episodes (two vs at 
least three); and index episode type (self-poisoning, self-
injury, or combination). Family therapists working across 
multiple CAMHS (15 CAMHS in Manchester, two 
in London, and four in Yorkshire) were randomly allocated 
to family therapy participants. Participants and therapists 
were aware of treatment allocation, whereas researchers 
were masked to enable unbiased follow-up.
Procedures
The research funder commissioned an analysis of a 
family therapy intervention for self-harm in people 
aged 11–17 years. Justifications for this are provided 
elsewhere11–13 and in the appendix. Young people were 
screened by a clinician at CAMHS after the index self-
harm episode. Patients eligible and consenting to 
researcher contact were visited at home by a researcher 
to discuss the trial, obtain written consent for 
participation, and conduct baseline assessments. 
The family therapy intervention14 was based on a 
modified version of an existing manual,15 allowing 
flexibility to deliver a complex intervention by 
experienced, qualified, family therapists able to make 
sophisticated clinical judgements.16 SHIFT family 
therapists received initial and ongoing training and 
monthly 2-h group supervision with a senior trial 
supervisor (PB, IE, or Charlotte Burke [Tavistock and 
Portman NHS Foundation Trust]).
Family therapy sessions lasted about 1·25 h and were 
delivered over 6 months at approximately monthly 
intervals, though more frequently initially. An intervention 
of six to eight sessions was selected after discussions with 
clinical services suggested that this would be the 
maximum number of sessions that could be delivered 
within usual resources. These discussions, alongside 
national audit data,17 indicated that typical intervention 
length in UK CAMH services was five to eight sessions. 
Therapist adherence to family therapy was ensured 
through training, use of the manual, and regular external 
and peer supervision. Family therapy was monitored to 
ensure the number and timing of sessions was as planned. 
With consent, sessions were video recorded to facilitate 
supervision. A random sample of videotapes (at least two 
per therapist) were independently rated by trained raters 
with clinical experience to measure adherence to the core 
elements of the manualised family therapy, using 
a structured rating scale18 (scores were 0–5 for adherence 
and 0–6 for competence; higher scores indicate 
greater adherence or competence).
Treatment as usual was offered to young people by local 
CAMHS teams and was unrestricted. We expected 
treatment as usual to be diverse and involve individual or 
family-orientated work, or both, delivered by a range 
of practitioners with different theoretical orientations. 
Clinicians who were involved with families in both groups 
could refer patients for additional specialist assessment 
and treatment as necessary. Further information about the 
therapy interventions is in the appendix.
Questionnaires for suicide ideation, quality of life, 
depression, mental health, family functioning, self-harm, 
emotional traits, health economics, and engagement 
with therapy were administered at baseline and 3, 6, 12, 
and 18 months after random group assignment, or 
different combinations of these timepoints (table 1). 
Questionnaires were completed by the young person, 
caregiver, or both. One questionnaire was also completed 
by the therapist.
All treatment data acquired after randomisation 
were provided by treating CAMHS clinicians, family 
therapists, clinical studies officers from local research 
networks, and researchers after participant follow-up was 
complete and masking unnecessary.
Hospital attendance data were obtained from accident 
and emergency and inpatient hospital episode statistics 
datasets from NHS Digital. These data were augmented 
by directed hospital record searches, undertaken by 
masked researchers as required throughout the trial.19
Outcomes
The primary outcome was repetition of self-harm leading 
to hospital attendance in the 18 months after group 
assignment.
Secondary outcomes (at 12 and 18 months unless 
indicated) were repetition of self-harm leading to hospital 
attendance in the 12 months after group assignment; cost 
per self-harm event avoided because of family therapy 
(health economics analysis); characteristics (timing, 
number, severity, and dangerousness of method used) of all 
further self-harm episodes (those resulting in hospital 
attendance and all self-reported episodes); suicidal ideation; 
quality of life; depression; overall mental health and 
emotional and behavioural difficulties; hopelessness; family 
functioning; identification of moderating and mediating 
variables of adherence and engagement and benefit 
from treatment; therapeutic alliance to family therapy; 
and therapist adherence to the family therapy manual.
Non-serious adverse events were defined as attendance 
at accident and emergency and minor injury and walk-in 
centres, and re-referral to CAMHS, because these events 
were expected to occur within our study population. 
Serious adverse events were defined as deaths and 
hospital admissions. Adverse event data were obtained 
through researcher collection of data from CAMHS, 
Acute Trusts, and via hospital episode statistics from 
NHS Digital.
Statistical analysis
We calculated that 832 participants (with 172 total 
events) were required to provide 90% power at a 
5% significance level to detect the minimally important

reduction in 18-month hospital admission for self-
harm repetition—an absolute risk reduction of 10%, 
from 29% in the treatment as usual group20 to 19% in 
the family therapy group—using a log-rank test, 
providing a constant hazard ratio of 1·64, and assuming 
a loss to follow-up at 18 months of 10% or less.
Analyses described in a prespecified statistical analysis 
plan, approved by independent oversight committees, 
were done in the intention-to-treat population. All 
statistical testing used two-sided 5% significance levels 
and was done using SAS, version 9.4. Formal interim 
analysis of the primary endpoint, after 86 events, was 
reviewed by the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee, 
who recommended recruitment of the full sample.
We analysed the primary outcome using Cox’s 
proportional hazards, accounting for covariates 
(minimisation factors [sex, age, living arrangements, 
two vs three previous self-harm episodes, and index 
episode type] and NHS trust) to test for differences in 
the number of hospital attendances and times to 
attendance. Kaplan–Meier curves were used to show 
time to self-harm for each group. Participants without 
an event were censored at the time last known to be 
event free. We did a sensitivity analysis examining the 
effect of clustering (for therapists and NHS trusts) 
using multilevel survival frailty models,21 and the 
impact of unclassified hospital attendances (unknown 
whether because of self-harm or not).
We analysed secondary outcomes, including recurrent 
events analysis, on the basis of the Andersen-Gill22 
method to analyse all hospital attendances because of 
self-harm. Repeated measures models (covariance 
pattern) adjusted for baseline score and covariates 
estimated treatment differences for questionnaire 
responses. Moderator variables (appendix) were assessed 
via interaction effects in the primary endpoint analysis, 
and those meeting the 5% significance level are reported. 
We did an exploratory complier average causal effect 
analysis, using instrumental variable probit regression, to 
model the causal effect of family therapy (regardless of 
initial treatment group assignment) on the primary 
outcome. Further mediator analysis methods and results 
are described in the appendix.
Participants with missing data for time-to-event 
outcomes (hospital attendance resulting from self-harm 
and primary, recurrent, and moderator analyses) were 
censored at baseline. Multiple imputation, assuming 
data were missing at random, was used to account 
for missing questionnaire data;23 complete case formed a 
sensitivity analysis.

A within-trial health economic evaluation compared 
outcomes and costs over 18 months of follow-up using trial 
data with quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and hospital 
attendance for a self-harm event avoided because of family 
therapy. Responses to the adolescent self-completed 
EQ-5D-3L questionnaire for measuring generic health 
status created a health profile of five digits,24 which was 
converted into utility by use of standard UK tariff values25 
and multiplied by time spent in each state to generate 
QALYs. The choice of EQ-5D-3L was guided by a pilot 
study.26 Costs were based on resource usage incurred to 
NHS and social services while providing family therapy or 
treatment as usual, and incorporated hospital, primary, 
community, or social care service attendance, and

medications reported by participants over the 18-month 
period (appendix). Resource usage was converted into 
costs using unit cost figures from the PSSRU Costs of 
Health and Social Care27 and Department of Health 
Reference 
Costs.28 
Missing 
data 
were 
imputed 
using multiple imputations via chained equations as 
recommended for economic analyses alongside clinical 
trials.29 The cost of the intervention was calculated 
separately for the family therapy and treatment as usual 
groups, including any treatment details recorded (duration, 
number of therapists involved, type, attendance, telephone 
contact, and supervision meetings). April, 2014, to March, 
2015, was used as the reference financial year. The discount 
rate was 3·5% as per NICE guidelines.25 Parameter 
uncertainty was addressed through probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis. Non-parametric bootstrapping generated simu-
lations of mean costs and effects for each group.
A decision analysis model evaluated the cost-effectiveness 
of family therapy versus treatment as usual over a longer 
time period (5 years), using a Markov model with three 
health states: stop self-harm, repeat self-harm leading to 
hospital attendance, and death. Parameter uncertainty was 
addressed through probabilistic sensitivity analysis using 
MonteCarlo simulation (appendix).
We present outputs of the within-trial analysis and the 
decision analysis model as expected incremental cost-
effectiveness ratios of family therapy versus treatment as 
usual using scatter plots on the cost-effectiveness plane 
and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Sensitivity 
analyses varied key parameters, including the number of 
therapists involved in family therapy and aggregated 
QALYs, for which the QALY gains for caregiver and young 
person were simply summed.30,31 Caregivers’ health-related 
quality of life was assessed using the Health Utilities 
Index version 3,32 and responses were converted into 
utility values.33 QALYs were calculated in the same manner 
as the young persons’ QALYs. The trial is registered at 
the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN59793150. 
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data

all data in the study and had final responsibility for the 
decision to submit for publication.
Results
Between Nov 23, 2009, and Dec 31, 2013, 3554 young 
people were screened and 1603 (45%) were deemed 
eligible. 993 (62%) of 1603 eligible young people 
consented to researcher contact, and 832 (52%) were then 
randomly assigned to receive family therapy (n=415) or 
treatment as usual (n=417; figure 1). All patients assigned 
to treatment were included in the analysis. One patient 
was younger than 18 years at the point of screening, 
but turned 18 just before random group assignment; 
this person was included in the intention-to-treat analysis. 
Baseline characteristics between groups were similar 
at random group assignment (table 2; appendix). Mean 
age was 14·3 years (SD 1·4), and 737 (89%) of the 
832 young people were female. 739 (89%) had self-
harmed on at least three previous occasions; the most 
recent episode leading to CAMHS referral was self-injury 
for 594 (71%) patients and self-poisoning for 184 (22%) 
patients, with a further 54 (6%) patients being referred 
for both of these reasons. Suicide Attempt Self-Injury 
Interview (SASII) scores indicated that 516 (62%) 
participants met the criteria for non-suicidal self-injury. 
830 (>99%) of the 832 participants were living with their 
parents or guardians rather than in foster care, and 
784 (94%) were in full-time education.

*Included as eligible because all three young people had other previous self-harm confirmed in the SASII timeline, and 
these three events were included, because in the judgement of the research team, the young people were in the process 
of self-harming as described in the eligibility criteria but the act was interrupted either by the young person or another 
person. †Includes psychotropic medications for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (six people), anti-anxiety (one), 
antipsychotic (two), and antidepressant (28) medications, and sedatives or sleep medications (five). ‡Parental, marked 
physical, and sexual abuse were each reported as separate events.

Baseline data showed that a higher proportion of 
participants had experienced marked difficulties in our 
cohort than is typical for young people referred to 
CAMHS, indicating a higher-risk population,17 as would 
be expected for young people who had self-harmed at 
least twice. 528 (63%) of the 832 participants were direct 
community referrals to CAMHS and the remaining 
304 (37%) were recruited after an accident and emergency 
attendance resulting from self-harm (table 2). Additional 
baseline data from caregiver and young person 
questionnaires are in the appendix.
At the 18-month follow-up, 21 (3%) of the 832 participants 
had withdrawn consent for clinical data collection (eight in 
the family therapy group and 13 in the treatment as usual 
group; figure 1). Most participants were successfully linked 
to hospital episode statistics data based on participant 
identifiers. Full primary outcome data were available 
for 795 (96%) participants, partial data were available 
for 33 (4%), and no data were available for four (<1%).
Substantial loss to follow-up occurred for participant-
reported secondary outcomes. At 12 months, researcher 
follow-up was possible for 248 (60%) participants in the 
family therapy group and 189 (45%) in the treatment as 
usual group. At 18 months, 204 (49%) of 415 participants 
in family therapy and 165 (40%) of 417 in the treatment as 
usual group were followed up. Overall at least one follow-
up was completed for 498 (60%) of 832 participants. 
More losses to follow-up occurred in the treatment as 
usual group than in the family therapy group (figure 1); 
participants lost to follow-up had less favourable 
baseline characteristics in terms of their scores on the 
Strengths 
and 
Difficulties 
Questionnaire 
(SDQ), 
McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD), Global 
Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12), and Inventory of 
Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU), and were more likely 
to have been referred into CAMHS from hospital. Results 
indicated that more participants with less favourable 
characteristics were lost to follow-up in the treatment as 
usual group than in the family therapy group, based on 
SDQ, FAD, and ICU scores (data not shown).
In the family therapy group, 21 (5%) of 415 young 
people attended no family therapy sessions and 394 (95%) 
attended at least one family therapy session; in the 
treatment as usual group, 33 (8%) of 417 attended no 
sessions of treatment as usual, 339 (81%) attended at 
least one session, and data were missing for 45 (11%) 
people. A median of six family therapy sessions were 
attended (IQR 3·0–9·0; range 0–21), lasting a median of 
5·1 months. The pattern was more varied in the treat-
ment as usual group: median of five sessions attended 
(IQR 2·0–12·5; range 0–163), over 4·4 months.
The treatment given to patients in the treatment as 
usual group varied considerably, with the most common 
type being supportive therapy or counselling. The other 
most used types of therapy included cognitive behavioural 
therapy, family work (discussion meetings with families 
without formal family therapy), and formal systemic 
family therapy (appendix). About 20% of sessions were 
for assessment or review rather than therapy (appendix).
Analysis of 52 family therapy video recordings (23 first 
sessions, 29 later sessions, involving 26 therapists, in 
patients in the family therapy group) showed good 
adherence of therapists to the manual (mean score 
4·6 [SD 0·72]) and good competence (4·4 [1·03]) in 
conducting the sessions.
At the 18-month follow-up, 221 (27%) of 832 young 
people had attended hospital after repeated self-harm; 
118 (28%) of 415 in the family therapy group and 
103 (25%) of 417 in the treatment as usual group 
(figure 2); the hazard ratio for family therapy versus 
treatment as usual was 1·14 (95% CI 0·87–1·49; p=0·33; 
table 3). Sensitivity and exploratory (complier average 
causal effect) analyses confirmed primary analysis results 
(table 3; appendix). Repeated self-harm was less common 
in male participants and those who were 15 years or 
older. Proportions of patients who repeated self-harm 
varied substantially across study centres, and were higher 
in the subgroups of participants referred to CAMHS via 
hospital (vs those referred via the community) and those 
with an index episode combining self-injury and 
poisoning (vs either method alone). The method used for 
the primary self-harm outcome event was often different 
from that for the index event, and more than half of

participants who repeated by self-poisoning had self-
injured at their index episode.
Neither the proportion of people who attended hospital 
after repeated self-harm within 12 months nor the 
number of recurrent events were significantly different 
between the two groups (table 3). 
Young people’s questionnaire outcomes for depression 
(Children’s Depression Rating Scale—revised), quality of 
life (Paediatric Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction 
questionnaire), hopelessness (Hopelessness Scale for 
Children), family functioning (FAD), caregiver mental 
health (GHQ-12), and expressed emotion (the Family 
Questionnaire) were not significantly different between 
the two groups (table 1; appendix). Family therapy 
participants reported significantly better behaviour 
outcomes on subscales of the SDQ for the young person 
and caregiver, young person suicidal ideation (Beck Scale 
for Suicide Ideation), and caregiver family functioning 
(FAD; appendix) than the treatment as usual group. 
Because of substantial and differential loss to follow-up, 
between-group differences should be interpreted with 
caution. However, complete-case sensitivity analysis 
found similar results to those reported by use of multiple 
imputation, with no change to conclusions.
Self-harm was self-reported on the SASII for 349 (73%) 
of 478 participants during the 12–18 months follow-up for 
whom data were available; 202 (75%) of 268 in family 
therapy and 147 (70%) of 210 in treatment as usual.
The number of participants referred to other services 
(including inpatient units) and safety outcomes 
(re-referrals to CAMHS, accident and emergency 
attendances, and hospital admissions for any reason; 
table 4) were similar for both groups. 1036 adverse events 
were reported for 443 (53%) of the 832 participants 
(226 [54%] of 415 in the family therapy and 217 [52%] of 417 
in the treatment as usual group), with a mean of 1·2 events

*Further secondary analysis using adjusted probit regression found similar estimates for the intention-to-treat, as treated, and complier average causal effect analysis. There was a similar effect of family therapy 
receipt in the complier average causal effect analysis (parameter estimate 0·12 [SE 0·13],p=0·34) compared with the standard intention-to-treat estimate of the allocation of family therapy (0·11 [SE 0·10], 
p=0·24), and the as treated estimate (0·10 [SE 0·10], p=0·31); with no significant differences detected between trial groups, or receipt of family therapy. †47 unclassified attendances in 41 participants were 
classed as being related to self-harm, thus contributing new primary outcome events for 18 participants, and earlier primary outcome events for nine participants. ‡p values are for type of index episode (injury, 
poisoning, or combined).

per participant (SD 2·1). 598 serious adverse events were 
reported for 297 (36%) participants (156 [38%] of 415 in the 
family therapy and 141 [34%] of 417 in the treatment as 
usual group). No deaths were reported (table 4).
Significant moderation of the primary outcome was 
detected for the unemotional subscale of the young 
person-reported ICU, and the affective involvement 
subscale of the caregiver-reported family functioning 
measure (FAD). No moderation was detected for other 
baseline factors (appendix).
In young people who reported difficulty talking about 
feelings on the ICU, those in the family therapy group 
had an increased risk of hospital attendance for repeat 
self-harm versus those in the treatment as usual group; 
whereas in young people who reported that they could 
discuss feelings easily, those in the family therapy 
group had a decreased risk versus those in the treatment 
as usual group (p=0·010; figure 3A). This moderation 
was such that as the young person reported greater 
difficulty in talking about feelings (1 point increase on 
the ICU, equivalent to worse or more severe trait), the 
risk of self-harm increased in the family therapy group 
(HR 1·05 [95% CI 0·98–1·12]) and decreased in the 
treatment as usual group (HR 0·93 [0·88–0·99]). 
Conversely, as the young person reported less difficulty 
talking about feelings (1 point decrease on the ICU), 
the risk of self-harm decreased in the family therapy 
group (HR 0·95 [95% CI 0·89–1·02]) and increased in 
the treatment as usual group (HR 1·08 [1·01–1·14]).
In young people whose caregivers reported healthier 
affective involvement (degree to which family members 
are involved and interested in one another) on the FAD, 
those in the family therapy group had a higher risk of 
self-harm than those in the treatment as usual group; 
whereas in young people with poorer affective 
involvement, those in family therapy had a decreased 
risk versus those in treatment as usual (p=0·034; 
figure 3B). This moderation was such that as the 
caregiver reported more affective involvement problems 
(1 point increase on the FAD, equivalent to worse or 
more severe trait), the risk of self-harm decreased in the 
family therapy group (HR 0·89 [95% CI 0·59–1·34]) and 
increased in the treatment as usual group (HR 1·63 
[95% CI 1·11–2·39]; appendix). Conversely, as the 
caregiver reported fewer affective involvement problems 
(1 point decrease on the FAD), the risk of self-harm 
increased in the family therapy group (HR 1·12 [95% CI 
0·75–1·69]) and decreased in the treatment as usual 
group (HR 0·61 [95% CI 0·42–0·90]). Cost-effectiveness 
analyses showed an increase in the mean EQ-5D-3L 
score in both groups at the 18-month follow-up compared 
with baseline. Participants in the family therapy group 
incurred costs of GBP £1266 (95% CI 736 to 1796; 
p<0·0001), higher than those in the treatment as usual 
group, and gained 0·034 (95% CI –0·004 to 0·065; 
p=0·13) more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
equivalent to 12·4 more days of perfect health (table 5). 
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
£36 812 per QALY was higher than the recommended 
threshold range specified for NICE decision making in 
England and Wales (which is a gain of £20 000–30 000 
per QALY gained),25 showing that family therapy was 
probably not cost-effective. As the difference in QALY 
gains between family therapy and treatment as usual was 
marginal at 18 months and absent in the complete case 
analysis, decision analysis modelling was not required.

Family therapy was less cost-effective than treatment as 
usual, with an estimated 0·033 more self-harm events 
(95% CI –0·130 to 0·197; p=0·98), and a cost increase of 
£1253 (95% CI 725 to 1780; p<0·0001). In all sensitivity 
analyses of intervention costs, the ICER remained 
greater than NICE’s recommended threshold. However, 
combining young people’s and caregivers’ QALY gains, 
family therapy incurred higher costs than treatment 
as usual but better health outcomes (table 5). The 
corresponding ICER was £20 808 per QALY with a 
41% probability to be cost-effective at £20 000 per QALY 
(64% probability at £30 000 per QALY).
Discussion
In young people who had recently repeatedly self-
harmed, we found no clinical or cost benefits for family 
therapy over treatment as usual in terms of hospital 
attendance for subsequent repetition of self-harm. For 
interventions in which the whole family was the subject 
of the assessment, and more than one person is involved 
in treatment, methods to assess benefits (and harms) 
beyond the individual should be considered.30 Our 
finding that family therapy is cost-effective when 
considering combined benefits to the young person and 
caregiver is therefore salient, although it assumes QALYs 
can be aggregated across individuals as a simple sum. 
This addition has been done in previous studies of child 
health,34 but is not part of the NICE reference case and 
assumes interdependence between utilities (the health 
state) of the adolescent and caregiver.
Our study sample had baseline levels of difficulty at 
least as severe as the average CAMHS referral.17 The 
proportion of female participants recruited and the mix 
of referrals from hospital and community sources are 
similar to those seen in other studies.4 The treatments 
given in the treatment as usual group were highly varied, 
which can be expected from a pragmatic trial, but broadly 
similar to CAMHS practice in the UK with a mixture 
of supportive or individual counselling, cognitive 
behavioural therapy, and family work;17 however, the 
proportion of patients who received formal family 
therapy for self-harm (87 [21%] of 417) was much higher 
than we were expecting. Those in the treatment as usual 
group who received a version of family therapy did not, 
however, have significantly better primary outcome 
results than either those in the family therapy group or 
those in treatment as usual who only received other 
interventions.
Although we report almost complete data for the 
primary outcome, loss to follow-up resulted in partial 
data from 478 (57%) of 832 participants for self-reported 
self-harm at 18 months. Strenuous efforts were made by 
the research team to track participants via clinic and 
general practitioner records, and by use of letters, emails, 
telephone calls, and text messages. More frequent follow-
up might have maintained engagement with participants 
and improved follow-up but would have substantially 
added to the cost of the project and was not feasible while 
retaining an 18-month primary outcome. From the self-
report data, many self-harm events did not lead to 
hospital attendance (the primary outcome), with 
349 (73%) of 478 self-reporting self-harm; however, the 
self-reported results were similar between groups, and in 
line with the primary outcome finding that was based on 
hospital records. For other secondary outcomes, young 
people and their caregivers in the family therapy group 
reported significantly better outcomes on several 
elements 
of 
general 
emotional 
and 
behavioural 
difficulties (SDQ), suggesting family therapy had a 
significant positive effect on general mental health, even 
if this did not translate into reduced repetition of 
self-harm. Self-reported suicide ideation scores were 
lower in the family therapy group than in the treatment

as usual group at 12 months but not at 18 months, 
consistent with other family therapy research.35 It might 
be argued that reducing suicidal ideation sooner is a 
potentially important clinical benefit. Furthermore, those 
lost to follow-up in the treatment as usual group seemed 
to have had less favourable baseline characteristics 
(eg, depression), meaning that the participants in this 
group who returned data might have been a less impaired 
group than those who returned data in the family therapy 
group. This factor makes comparison between the 
groups unreliable and might mask any advantages 
gained by the family therapy group.
In our trial, families who reported poorer family 
functioning scores in relation to affective involvement 
benefitted more from family therapy (vs treatment as 
usual) than those with better scores; whereas previous 
studies have suggested that the families with good 
functioning benefit most from family therapy.36 The 
finding that adolescents who find communication about 
feelings difficult might do less well in a family 
intervention, where such expression is encouraged, is in 
line with the literature. These two findings together 
suggest an association between adolescent and family 
functioning, and ability to talk about feelings, that is 
more complex than previously reported. Harrington and 
colleagues’ study37 of a home-based intervention for self-
harm found moderation by depression, with family 
therapy reducing suicidal ideation in the absence of 
depression in the young person.37 Families with high 
levels of criticism tend to drop out of family therapy for 
eating disorders and do worse in conjoint family therapy 
than when parents and adolescents are seen in parallel.38
Our study differs from other trials of interventions to 
reduce self-harm in its substantially larger sample size, 
long follow-up, and use of an objectively measured 
primary outcome (hospital attendance) that traced 
96% of participants. For example, three other studies 
have reported positive outcomes for self-harm reduction 
following 
dialectical 
behaviour 
therapy 
(n=77),39 
mentalisation-based treatment (n=80),40 and family 
psychoeducation (n=48),41 but all recruited far fewer 
participants than our study, and their primary outcomes 
used 
retrospective 
self-report 
questionnaires 
and 
interview measures—with potential for reporting biases. 
The most rigorous other published study, the ASSIST 
trial of routine care plus group therapy,42 assigned 
366 young people and used masked-researcher-rated 
structured interview techniques to elicit the frequency of 
self-harm events, with good follow-up attendance. 
ASSIST also found no significant clinical or cost benefits 
for its primary outcome of frequency of repetition of 
self-harm.
Most young people in our trial (594 [71%] of 832) had

self-poisoned (184 [22%]), differing markedly from the 
17% in a monitoring study in three English cities of 
5200 consecutive hospital attendances for self-harm in 
people younger than 18 years;4 the discrepancy is 
explained by the high proportion of trial participants 
recruited from community referrals in our study. 
Participants in our trial must have self-harmed at least 
twice, complicating comparison with other studies 
because previous self-harm is not always reported 
consistently. SASII ratings suggested that 516 (62%) of 
832 patients’ index events would be classified as non-
suicidal self-injury but 412 (50%) of participants were 
rated by the researcher as having some intent to die; we 
deem the UK definition of self-harm, which disregards 
motive, to be justified because of ambiguity and difficulty 
interpreting statements of intent. The fact that the 
method used for the primary self-harm outcome event 
was often different from that for the index event 
(more than half of participants who self-poisoned at 
repetition had self-injured at their index episode) further 
challenges any assumption of non-suicidality in young 
people who self-injure.
The SHIFT version of family therapy placed great 
emphasis 
on 
families 
discussing 
self-harm 
and 
formulating strategies to deal with subsequent events—
often involving the seeking of help from external 
agencies. Therefore, the intervention itself might have 
differentially increased presentation to hospital for self-
harm and as a result, confounded results. However, the 
large proportion of missing self-reported data makes it 
difficult to test this hypothesis in this trial. The pragmatic 
design of this trial also conferred a potential advantage 
on treatment as usual because experienced CAMHS 
clinicians in the treatment as usual group had flexibility 
in selecting treatments on the basis of clinical assessment 
and discussions with the young person and family 
about preferred treatment strategies.
The substantial loss to follow-up markedly limited 
the interpretation of secondary participant-reported 
questionnaire outcomes and health economic analyses. 
The large proportion of missing data, imputed through 
multiple imputation, increases the variability in 
secondary outcomes, limiting inferences where non-
significant differences were detected. Analysis relies on 
the missing at random assumption, with missingness 
fully explained through observed data; covariates and 
treatment were therefore included in our imputation 
model to support this as a plausible assumption.
The low intensity of treatment given in our family 
therapy intervention could have reduced the chance of 
finding a positive effect of family therapy. The average 
number of sessions in UK CAMHS clinics17 is low relative 
to those in some studies of psychological inteventions, but 
we received a strong clinical message from collaborating 
sites that participants who had self-harmed were difficult 
to engage in treatment and would not adhere to a longer 
and more intensive intervention than that which was 
delivered in our study. Because this was a pragmatic trial, 
we designed an intervention that would be broadly 
equivalent in the number of sessions to those in the 
treatment as usual and likely, if successful, to be funded by 
the UK health-care system. No a priori evidence exists for 
an advantage of longer duration of therapy. In practice, 
participants in the family therapy and treatment as usual 
groups did receive broadly similar numbers of sessions. 
A more intensive intervention might have been more 
successful but might also have led to concerns that positive 
findings were as a result of the intensity of the intervention 
rather than the intervention itself. The same arguments 
might apply to the ASSIST trial in which the mean 
number of sessions attended for the core intervention was 
10·2 (vs a median of six sessions in our study).42
The SHIFT trial shows that this version of family 
therapy did not confer extra benefits in reducing the risk 
of hospital attendance after further self-harm. The trial 
participants were a high-risk group, having self-harmed at 
least twice, and comparisons cannot be drawn with those 
presenting for the first time after self-harm. Some 
evidence supports the increased effectiveness of family 
therapy versus treatment as usual in reducing self-harm 
in cases in which caregivers report poor family 
functioning, or young people report ease in discussing 
emotions. Conversely, when young people report difficulty 
in expressing emotion, or families report healthy 
functioning, other interventions or modifications of 
family therapy might be indicated.
The findings might not be generalisable to the subset 
of adolescents who present to hospital in the UK after a 
first episode of self-harm. However, this trial does 
confirm that young people are likely to switch methods 
in subsequent episodes of self-harm and that the method 
of self-harm might not be a useful indicator of suicidal 
intent or risk. The trial provides some evidence that 
family therapy has a positive effect on general emotional 
and behavioural problems and might reduce suicidal 
ideation faster than treatment as usual, albeit based on 
self-report measures with substantial amounts of 
missing data. Young people who self-harm form a varied 
and heterogeneous group with self-harm likely to be the 
final common pathway for a wide range of predicaments. 
Future research needs to explore the characteristics of 
specific subgroups within the self-harming population. 
Possible candidate groups arising from this research 
would be families who self-report poorer family 
functioning, young people who are more unemotional, 
and those referred to CAMHS directly from the hospital 
rather than from the community. Further analysis of the 
effect modifiers in SHIFT might have a useful 
explanatory or theoretical function and help develop 
effective interventions. Longer follow-up studies are 
needed and the possibility that family therapy might 
have had benefits beyond that of the participant deserves 
further exploration, including how health economic 
benefits might be aggregated for family members.
