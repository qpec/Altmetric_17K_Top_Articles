Introduction
Enduring clinically significant anxiety and/or depressive symp-
toms are common in patients with cancer, present in 30–40% of 
patients in hospital settings (Mitchell et al., 2011). These symp-
toms are associated with a variety of poor outcomes, including 
medication non-adherence, increased health care utilization, 
adverse medical outcomes, decreased quality of life, decreased 
social function, increased disability, hopelessness, increased 
pain, increased desire for hastened death, increased rates of sui-
cide, and decreased survival rates (Arrieta et al., 2013; Brown 
et al., 2003; Jaiswal et al., 2014).
Although pharmacotherapeutic and psychosocial interven-
tions are commonly used to treat anxiety and depression in 
 
cancer patients, their efficacy is mixed and limited (Grassi 
et al., 2014; NCCN, 2014). There are no US Food and Drug 
Administration approved pharmacotherapies for cancer-related 
psychological distress, the onset of clinical improvement with 
anti-depressants is delayed, relapse rates are high, and significant 
side effects compromise treatment adherence (Freedman, 2010; 
Li et al., 2012).

Abstract
Background: Clinically significant anxiety and depression are common in patients with cancer, and are associated with poor psychiatric and medical 
outcomes. Historical and recent research suggests a role for psilocybin to treat cancer-related anxiety and depression.
Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, 29 patients with cancer-related anxiety and depression were randomly assigned and 
received treatment with single-dose psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) or niacin, both in conjunction with psychotherapy. The primary outcomes were anxiety 
and depression assessed between groups prior to the crossover at 7 weeks.
Results: Prior to the crossover, psilocybin produced immediate, substantial, and sustained improvements in anxiety and depression and led to 
decreases in cancer-related demoralization and hopelessness, improved spiritual wellbeing, and increased quality of life. At the 6.5-month follow-
up, psilocybin was associated with enduring anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects (approximately 60–80% of participants continued with clinically 
significant reductions in depression or anxiety), sustained benefits in existential distress and quality of life, as well as improved attitudes towards 
death. The psilocybin-induced mystical experience mediated the therapeutic effect of psilocybin on anxiety and depression.
Conclusions: In conjunction with psychotherapy, single moderate-dose psilocybin produced rapid, robust and enduring anxiolytic and anti-depressant 
effects in patients with cancer-related psychological distress.

With a growing body of evidence linking higher levels of 
existential/spiritual wellbeing (in cancer patients) with improved 
quality of life and decreased depression/hopelessness/suicidality 
(Breitbart et al., 2000; McClain et al., 2003; Nelson et al., 2002), 
the need to develop effective therapeutic approaches to mitigate 
this domain of distress has become increasingly recognized 
within the disciplines of palliative care and psycho-oncology 
(emphasized within the last two decades by the Institute of 
Medicine, the World Health Organization, the National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network, the Joint Commission, the 
National Consensus Project, and the National Quality Forum) 
and improvement in these domains is now accepted as an integral 
component in the care of cancer patients (Puchalski, 2012). A 
number of manualized existentially oriented psychotherapies 
have been developed to address these existential/spiritual issues, 
with some empirical support from clinical trials (Lemay and 
Wilson, 2008), and several of these approaches were integrated 
into the therapy platform developed for this study. There are cur-
rently no pharmacotherapies or evidence-based combined phar-
macological-psychosocial interventions to treat this particular 
type of distress and unmet clinical need in cancer patients 
(Breitbart et al., 2010).
Psilocybin, a tryptamine serotoninergic psychedelic, exerts its 
consciousness altering effects via 5HT2A agonism (Vollenweider 
and Kometer, 2010). It has a well-established physiological and 
psychological safety profile in human laboratory and clinical trial 
research (Johnson et al., 2008), is not known to be addictive and 
may have anti-addictive properties (Bogenschutz and Johnson, 
2016; Krebs and Johansen, 2012; Ross, 2012). It can produce 
highly salient spiritual/mystical states of consciousness associ-
ated with enduring (months to years) positive changes in cogni-
tion, affect, behavior, and spirituality (Doblin, 1991; Griffiths 
et al., 2006, 2008, 2011; Pahnke, 1963). From the early 1960s to 
the early 1970s, clinical research utilizing the serotoninergic 
psychedelics, primarily lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), to 
treat terminal cancer-related psychological and existential dis-
tress was conducted at major academic medical centers in the 
United States with a total of several hundred participants. These 
studies occurred largely in the context of open-label trials and 
showed improvements in the following symptom domains: anxi-
ety, depression, fear of dying, quality of life, and pain (Grob 
et al., 2013; Grof et al., 1973; Kast, 1966; Kast and Collins, 1964; 
Pahnke et al., 1969).
Research into the use of hallucinogen treatment models for 
psycho-spiritual distress in advanced or terminal cancer ceased in 
the mid 1970s with the passage of the Controlled Substance Act 
of 1970, which placed all of the serotoninergic psychedelics into 
schedule I of the US Drug Enforcement Administration’s classi-
fication of regulated psychoactive substances.
Building upon hallucinogen research with cancer patients 
from over four decades ago, two recently published randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) with serotoninergic psychedelics to treat 
cancer-related psychological distress, one using psilocybin in 
patients with advanced-stage cancer conducted at Harbor-UCLA 
(Grob et al., 2011) and the other using LSD in patients with a 
variety of life-threatening illnesses including but not limited to 
cancer diagnoses (Gasser et al., 2014), suggested acute and sus-
tained treatment benefits. The University of California Los 
Angeles RCT in patients with advanced-stage cancer included 
 
a cohort of 12 participants and reported on the medical 
 
and psychiatric safety of administering low-dose psilocybin 
 
(0.2 mg/kg) in conjunction with psychotherapy, and revealed 
trends towards reduced depression and anxiety in the psilocybin 
group compared to the control condition (Grob et al., 2011).
In the present RCT, the primary hypothesis was that psilocy-
bin, in conjunction with targeted psychotherapy, would signifi-
cantly decrease anxiety and depression symptoms (compared to 
an active control, niacin, and the same dose of psychotherapy as 
the experimental group) in patients with life-threatening cancer 
diagnoses.
Methods
Study design and interventions
This randomized, blinded, controlled, crossover, study was 
designed to investigate the efficacy of a single psilocybin dosing 
session (0.3 mg/kg) versus one dosing session of an active con-
trol (niacin 250 mg), administered in conjunction with psycho-
therapy, to treat clinically significant anxiety or depression in 
patients with life-threatening cancer (see Supplementary Methods 
for information on inclusion/exclusion criteria, blinding proce-
dures, medication sessions and psychotherapy procedures). The 
trial employed a two-session, double-blind, crossover (7 weeks 
after administration of dose 1) design to compare groups. 
Participants were randomly assigned to two oral dosing session 
sequences: psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) first then niacin (250 mg) sec-
ond, or niacin (250 mg) first then psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) second 
(Figures 1 and 2). Randomization did not stratify for any demo-
graphic (i.e. gender, race, spiritual/religious affiliation) or clini-
cal characteristics (i.e. stage of cancer, prior hallucinogen use). 
Drug administration dose 1 (psilocybin or control) occurred 2–4 
weeks (mean 18 days) after baseline assessments and the crosso-
ver occurred 7 weeks (mean 52 days) after dose 1, at which point 
drug administration dose 2 occurred. Data assessments occurred 
at baseline (2–4 weeks prior to dose 1), 1 day prior to dose 1, day 
of dose 1 (7 hours post-dose), 1 day after dose 1, 2 weeks after 
dose 1, 6 weeks after dose 1, 7 weeks after dose 1 (1 day prior to 
dose 2), day of dose 2 (7 hours post-dose), 1 day after dose 2, 6 
weeks after dose 2, and 26 weeks after dose 2 (Figure 2). The 
total duration of study participation was approximately 9 months 
(mean 253 days). The primary outcome variables were anxiety 
and depression assessed prior to the crossover. Secondary out-
come measures (assessed before and after the crossover) included 
assessments of existential distress, quality of life, and spirituality, 
as well as measures assessing immediate and sustained effects of 
psilocybin administration on subjective (e.g. mystical) experi-
ence, cognition, affect, spirituality, and behavior.
Study sample and setting
Of 108 participants pre-screened, 42 gave informed consent 
and of these 29 patients were randomly assigned and received 
treatment with single-dose psilocybin or single-dose niacin 
control (Table 1 and Figure 1). The study was approved and 
monitored by the institutional review board of the New York 
University (NYU) School of Medicine. The majority of par-
ticipants were recruited from a clinical cancer center at an aca-
demic medical facility (NYU Langone’s Perlmutter Cancer 
Center). Data were collected from 18 February 2009 to 22 
 Ross et al. 
1167
October 2014 and the analysis was conducted from 3 
November 2014 to 11 December 2015.
Nearly two-thirds of participants (62%) had advanced cancers 
(stages III or IV). The types of cancer included: breast or repro-
ductive (59%); gastrointestinal (17%); hematologic (14%); other 
(10%). In accordance with the study’s inclusion criteria, all par-
ticipants carried an anxiety-related diagnosis per the severe com-
bined immunodeficiency (SCID) (Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV) with the majority meet-
ing criteria for an adjustment disorder (26, 90%) and the rest for 
generalized anxiety disorder (three, 10%). Nearly two-thirds 
(59%) had previously been treated with anti-depressant or anxio-
lytic medication, but none were on any psychotropics at the time 
of study enrollment, per the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Assessments
Safety assessments. Adverse events (AEs) attributed to study 
medications (psilocybin, niacin) were monitored throughout the 
trial, including during and after medication administration 
sessions.
Cardiovascular measures were assessed during medication 
sessions. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and heart 
rate (HR) were measured at the following time points during the 
medication dosing sessions: baseline, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 
300, 360 minutes post-dose administration.
Primary Outcome Measures. Clinical primary outcome mea-
sures (anxiety, depression) were assessed at baseline, 1 day prior

to dose 1, 1 day after dose 1, 2-weeks after dose 1, 6 weeks after 
dose 1, 7 weeks after dose 1 (corresponding to 1 day prior to dose 
2), 1 day after dose 2, 6 weeks after dose 2, and 26 weeks after 
dose 2: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (Zig-
mond and Snaith, 1983), self-rated subscales of anxiety (HADS 
anxiety or HAD A), depression (HADS depression or HAD D) 
and total (HADS total or HAD T) combined score in patients 
with physical health problems (e.g. cancer); Beck Depression 
Inventory (BDI) (Beck et al., 1988) self-report depression mea-
sure; Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (Spiel-
berger, 1983) self-report measure of state (STAI state or STAI S) 
and trait (STAI trait or STAI T) anxiety.
Secondary outcome measures. Cancer-related existential 
distress (demoralization, hopelessness, attitudes and affect 
associated with disease progression and death) was assessed 
 
at baseline, 2 weeks post-dose 1, and 26 weeks post-dose 2: 
Demoralization (DEM) scale (Kissane et al., 2004), self-report 
measure of the cancer-related demoralization syndrome (e.g. 
despair, helplessness, existential distress such as loss of 
 
hope/meaning/purpose in life, a sense of ‘giving up’, desire for 
hastened death); Hopelessness Assessment and Illness (HAI) 
scale (Rosenfeld et al., 2011) self-report measure of hopeless-
ness in advanced cancer; Death Anxiety Scale (DAS) (Templer, 
1970) a self-report questionnaire assessing the level of death 
anxiety; Death Transcendence Scale (DTS) (VandeCreek, 1999) 
a self-report measure of positive attitudes and adaptations to the 
finitude of life.
Quality of life was assessed at baseline, 2 weeks post-dose 1 
and 26 weeks post-dose 2: World Health Organization Qualify of 
Life scale, brief version (WHO-Bref) (WHO, 1994), self-report 
measure of quality of life in four domains (physical, psychologi-
cal, social relationships, environment).
Spirituality was assessed at baseline, 2 weeks post-dose 1 
and 26 weeks post-dose 2: Functional Assessment of Chronic 
Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being (FACIT-SWB) (Brady 
et al., 1999) a self-report measure of spiritual wellbeing gener-
ating three scales: meaning/peace, faith, total spiritual wellbe-
ing score. The meaning/peace scale assesses one’s sense of 
inner peace, meaning, and purpose in life and corresponds to 
the more existential components of religious or spiritual prac-
tice. The faith scale measures strength and comfort derived 
from one’s faith and emphasizes the more ritualized compo-
nents of religious/spiritual practice.

aThe two dose-sequence groups did not significantly differ on any demographic or clinical characteristic measures.
bPsychiatric classification was based on the structured clinical interview for the DSM-IV (SCID-IV).
Nearly two-thirds (59%) of participants had previously been treated with anti-depressant or anxiolytic medication, but none were on any psychotropics before study 
enrollment per inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Subjective drug effects/mystical experience was assessed at 7 
hours after drug administration sessions and retrospectively at 26 
weeks post-dose 2: the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ 
30) (Barrett et al., 2015) is a self-report questionnaire that evalu-
ates discrete mystical experiences induced by serotoninergic 
psychedelics and is sensitive to detecting psilocybin-induced 
mystical experiences (MacLean et al., 2012). In addition to an 
MEQ total score, the questionnaire generates four empirically 
derived factors: mystical; positive mood; transcendence of time 
and space; and ineffability. A retrospective version of the MEQ 
30 (MEQ retrospective scale) was administered at 26 weeks post-
dose 2. See Supplementary Methods section for more informa-
tion on the MEQ 30 and for other measures of subjective drug 
effects/mystical experience measured 7 hours after drug adminis-
tration sessions.
Persisting effects of psilocybin were assessed at 2 weeks 
 
post-dose 1 and 26 weeks post-dose 2: the Persisting Effects 
Questionnaire (PEQ), a self-report measure of changes in atti-
tudes, moods, behaviors and spiritual experiences, sensitive to 
the longitudinal effects of psilocybin administration (Griffiths 
et al., 2006, 2008, 2011). All participants (including in both 
 
the psilocybin first and niacin first groups) were asked at 
 
26 weeks after dose 2 to reflect on the meaningfulness, spiritual 
significance and changes in wellbeing relative to what they 
guessed 
was 
their 
psilocybin 
dosing 
experience 
(see 
Supplementary Methods secondary outcome measures).
See Supplementary Methods for other secondary outcome 
measures.
Statistical analysis
Whenever multiple time points were included in the analysis for 
continuous measures, repeated measures regressions, from the 
mixed effect repeated measurement (MMRM) model, were per-
formed in SAS PROC MIXED using an AR(1) covariance struc-
ture and fixed effects of group and time. Comparison t-tests from 
the MMRM analyses are reported for the primary and the con-
tinuous secondary outcome measures (see below).
For the primary outcome measures (anxiety, depression) in 
the two dosing sequences, planned between-group comparisons 
were made at the following time points: prior to the crossover at 
baseline, 1 day pre-dose 1, 1 day post-dose 1, 2 weeks post-dose 
1, 6 weeks post-dose 1, 7 weeks post-dose 1 (corresponding to 1 
day pre-dose 2) (Figure 3) and after the crossover at 1 day post-
dose 2, 6 weeks post-dose 2, and 26 weeks post-dose 2 (Figure 
4). Between-group effect sizes were calculated using Cohen’s d. 
Figure 3. Primary outcome variables: cancer-related anxiety and depression (pre-crossover).
Means (±SE) for primary outcome measures are shown in the two treatment groups at the following time points: baseline (psilocybin first n=14, niacin first n=15), 1 day 
pre-dose 1 (psilocybin first n=14, niacin first n=15), 1 day post-dose 1 (psilocybin first n=14, niacin first n=15), 2 weeks post-dose 1 (psilocybin first n=14, niacin first 
n=14), 6 weeks post-dose 1 (psilocybin first n=14, niacin first n=14), 7 weeks post-dose 1 (psilocybin first n=12, niacin first n=14). Asterisks indicate significance level 
of between-group t-tests. Effect sizes, represented as Cohen’s d, are shown above time points at which the treatment groups differ. Closed points represent significant 
within-group differences relative to scores at baseline.
 Ross et al.

Planned within-group comparison t-tests were conducted for 
each of the dosing sequences comparing the baseline to each of 
the following time points: 1 day pre-dose 1, 1 day post-dose 1, 2 
weeks post-dose 1, 6 weeks post-dose 1, 7 weeks post-dose 1 (1 
day pre-dose 2), 1 day post-dose 2, 6 weeks post-dose 2, 26 
weeks post-dose 2 (Figures 3 and 4). Within-group effect sizes 
for the dosing sequences were calculated at each time point, com-
pared to baseline, using Cohen’s d (Supplementary Table 1). To 
assess whether the magnitude of psilocybin-induced change in 
anxiety and depression differed across treatment groups, we 
compared change scores on the six primary outcome measures 
across each participant’s active (psilocybin) treatment session 
(from 1 day prior to psilocybin treatment to 1 day after psilocybin 
treatment) with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
For primary outcome measures (HAD D, BDI, HAD A, HAD 
T) that have empirical support in defining anti-depressant or 
anxiolytic response, clinically significant responses rates were 
defined as a 50% or greater reduction in the measure at a particu-
lar assessment point relative to baseline. Anti-depressant symp-
tom remission (HAD D, BDI) was defined as 50% or greater 
reduction in depressive symptoms plus HADS D ⩽7 (Hung et al., 
2012) or BDI ⩽12 (Reeves et al., 2012; Riedel et al., 2010), 
respectively. Planned chi-square analyses were performed to 
compare the percentage of participants, in the psilocybin first 
versus the niacin first groups, who met criteria for anxiolytic or 
anti-depressant response, or anti-depressant remission (BDI, 
HAD D) at the following time points: 1 day post-dose 1, 7 weeks 
post-dose 1, and 26 weeks post-dose 2 (Figure 5).
For cardiovascular measures assessed during the medication 
sessions, repeated measures regressions, from the mixed effect 
repeat measurement (MMRM) model, were conducted in SAS 
PROC MIXED using an AR(1) covariance structure and fixed 
effects of time, drug (psilocybin vs. niacin) and group (niacin 
first vs. psilocybin first) collapsed across treatment order at time 
points: baseline, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360 post-dosing 
(Supplementary Figure 1).
For the secondary outcome measures (cancer-related existen-
tial distress, quality of life, spirituality, persisting effects of psilo-
cybin), planned between-group comparisons were conducted 
generating the following comparisons: 1. niacin first group 2 
weeks post-dose 1 versus psilocybin first group 2 weeks post-dose 
1; 2. niacin first group 2 weeks post-dose 1 versus niacin first 
group 26 weeks post-dose 2; 3. niacin first group 2 weeks post-
dose 1 versus psilocybin first group 26 weeks post-dose 2; 4. psilo-
cybin first group 2 weeks post-dose 1 versus psilocybin first group 
26 weeks post-dose 2 (Figure 6 (bottom), Supplementary Table 2).

Ratings of persisting effects attributed to the medication ses-
sions were expressed as proportions for four items (see 
Supplemental Methods): positive behavioral change; meaning-
fulness, spiritual significance, and increases in personal wellbe-
ing. Planned chi-square analyses were performed: niacin first 
group at 2 weeks post-dose 1 and psilocybin first at 2 weeks post-
dose 1, niacin first at 2 weeks post-dose 1 and psilocybin first at 
26 weeks post-dose 2. McNemar tests were used to compare 
these proportions between the psilocybin first group at 2 weeks 
post-dose 1 and the psilocybin first group at 26 weeks post-dose 
2 and between the niacin first group at 2 weeks post-dose 1 and 
the niacin first group at 26 weeks post-dose 2 (Figure 6 (top)).
Subjective drug effects/mystical experiences were compared 
between groups using an independent sample t-test run in SAS at 
three time points: 7 hours post-medication administration in ses-
sions 1 and 2; and at 26 weeks post-dose 2 (Figure 7 (top)). 
Anxiety and depression change scores for the primary outcome 
measures (ΔHADS T, ΔHADS A, ΔHADS D, ΔBDI, ΔSTAI S, 
ΔSTAI T) were calculated from baseline to 6 weeks post-dose 1 
with either psilocybin or niacin. Spearman rank correlation coef-
ficients were calculated between the change scores and partici-
pant ratings on the MEQ total at 7 hours post-dose 1 to assess the 
relationship between subjective mystical experience and change 
in clinical outcomes. Significant relationships were further exam-
ined using partial correlations to control for end of session partic-
ipant-rated ‘intensity’ (item 98 from the HRS). In order to 
examine the mystical experience (using MEQ 30 scores) as a 
mediator of psilocybin versus niacin treatment on anxiety/depres-
sion outcomes, a bootstrap analysis was performed using the 
PROCESS macro (Hayes, 2013, Figure 7 (bottom)). The boot-
strapping method is a non-parametric approach that does not 
assume a normal distribution of the mediated effect, is appropri-
ate with small sample sizes, and was used to estimate 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs) for the mediation effect (Hayes, 2013). See 
Supplemental Methods.

analysis.

Demographics
As reported in Table 1, of the 29 participants who completed dose 
1, the majority were Caucasian (90%) and women (62%). The 
average age was 56.3 (range 22–75) years. Approximately half of 
the participants reported some organized religious faith versus

atheist/agnostic (52% vs. 48%) and slightly less than half reported 
no prior history of hallucinogen use (45%). Ninety per cent of 
participants met DSM-IV criteria for cancer-related adjustment 
disorder with anxious ± depressed features. The two dose-
sequence groups did not significantly differ on demographic or 
clinical characteristic measures. No dichotomous factors (i.e. 
gender, prior hallucinogen use vs. none, spiritual faith/religion 
vs. none, early vs. late cancer stage) significantly interacted with 
the primary outcome measures in between-group comparisons.
Safety assessments
Adverse events. There were no serious AEs, either medical or 
psychiatric, in the trial that were attributed to either psilocybin or 
niacin. Regarding psychiatric AEs, no pharmacological interven-
tions (e.g. benzodiazepines, anti-psychotics) were needed during 
dosing sessions, no participants abused or became addicted 
 
to psilocybin, there were no cases of prolonged psychosis 
or hallucinogen persisting perceptual disorder (HPPD), and no 
participants required psychiatric hospitalization. In terms of AEs 
attributable to psilocybin, the most common medical AEs were 
non-clinically significant elevations in BP and HR (76%), head-
aches/migraines (28%), and nausea (14%); the most common 
psychiatric AEs were transient anxiety (17%) and transient psy-
chotic-like symptoms (7%: one case of transient paranoid ide-
ation and one case of transient thought disorder). The medical 
AEs (non-clinically significant elevations in BP and HR, head-
aches, nausea), and psychiatric AEs (transient anxiety, transient 
near-psychotic symptoms) attributable to psilocybin are all 
known AEs of psilocybin, were transient, tolerable, and consis-
tent with prior trials of psilocybin administration in normal vol-
unteers (Griffiths et al., 2006, 2008, 2011), and patients with 
terminal cancer (Grob et al., 2011).
Cardiovascular effects during dosing sessions. Compared 
 
to the control, psilocybin produced statistically significant

differences in the following cardiovascular measures and time 
points: systolic BP: 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300 minutes; diastolic BP 
60, 90, 120, 180 minutes; pulse: 90, 120 minutes (see Supplemen-
tary Figure 1). Cardiovascular effects with psilocybin generally 
peaked at 180 minutes post-dosing and decreased towards pre-drug 
levels over the remainder of the session. Regarding the psilocybin 
first group, peak mean systolic and diastolic BPs were 142/83 (both 
recorded at 180 minutes post-dosing), while peak mean HR for this 
group was 71 at 300 minutes post-dosing (see Supplementary Fig-
ure 1). There were no serious adverse cardiac events, consistent 
with psilocybin’s absence of cardiac toxicity when administered in 
controlled laboratory settings (Studerus et al., 2011). The medical 
safety, time course, and magnitude of effects on these cardiovascu-
lar measures were consistent with those observed in previous stud-
ies of psilocybin in healthy volunteers (Griffiths et al., 2006, 2011) 
and patients with advanced cancer (Grob et al., 2011).
Primary outcomes
For each of the six primary outcome measures (HADS T, HADS 
A, HADS D, BDI, STAI S, STAI T), there were significant differ-
ences between the experimental and control groups (prior to the 
crossover at 7 weeks post-dose 1) with the psilocybin group 
(compared to the active control) demonstrating immediate, 
substantial, and sustained (up to 7 weeks post-dosing) clinical 
benefits in terms of reduction of anxiety and depression symp-
toms (Figure 3). The magnitude of differences between the psilo-
cybin and control groups (Cohen’s d effect sizes) was large across 
the primary outcome measures, assessed at 1 day/2 weeks/ 
6 weeks/7 weeks post-dose 1 (Figure 3).
Treatment groups did not differ in magnitude of change 
(e.g. 1 day before compared to 1 day after) across their respec-
tive psilocybin treatment sessions for any of the primary out-
come measures (BDI: F(1,26)=1.88, P=0.18; HADS A: 
F(1,26)=2.59, P=0.12; HADS D: F(1,26)=0.90, P=0.35; HADS T: 
F(1,26)=2.63, P=0.12; STAI S: F(1,26)=1.10, P=0.30; STAI T: 
F(1,26)=0.58, P=0.45).
For all primary outcome measures, the psilocybin first group 
demonstrated significant within-group reductions (compared to 
baseline at each post-baseline assessment point) in anxiety and 
depression immediately after receiving psilocybin (Figures 3 and 
4). These reductions remained significant at each time point, 
including the final point at 26 weeks post-dose 2 (approximately 
8 months), post-psilocybin dosing. Prior to the crossover, the nia-
cin first group demonstrated either no significant within-group 
reductions or a transient reduction that became non-significant 
prior to dose 2. For the majority (five/six) of the measures, the 
niacin first group demonstrated significant within-group

reductions in anxiety and depression immediately after receiving 
the psilocybin dose (dosing session 2), and these statistically 
significant improvements persisted until the end of the study 
(approximately 6.5 months post-psilocybin dosing, 26 weeks 
post-dose 2, for this group).
Psilocybin produced immediate and enduring anxiolytic and 
anti-depressant response rates, as well as significant anti-depres-
sant remission rates (measured by the HADS D and BDI) (Figure 
5). For example, 7 weeks after dose 1, 83% of participants in the 
psilocybin first group (vs. 14% in the niacin first group) met crite-
ria for anti-depressant response (with the BDI) and 58% (in the 
psilocybin first group) for anxiolytic response using the HAD A, 
compared to 14% in the niacin first group. At the 6.5-month fol-
low-up (after both groups received psilocybin), anti-depressant or 
anxiolytic response rates were approximately 60–80% (Figure 5).
Secondary outcomes
Figure 6 (bottom) shows the comparisons between dose-sequence 
groups on the following secondary outcome measures: cancer-
related existential distress (demoralization, hopelessness, atti-
tudes and affect associated with disease progression and death), 
quality of life, and spirituality. In the short-term (2 weeks post-
dose 1), psilocybin (compared to control) produced decreases in 
cancer-related demoralization and hopelessness, while improv-
ing spiritual wellbeing and quality of life (physical, psychologi-
cal, environmental domains). These effects were sustained at the 
final 6.5 month follow-up. Regarding anxiety and attitudes 
towards death, the data were mixed. In the short-term (2 weeks 
post-dose 1), psilocybin was not significantly associated with 
decreased death anxiety or increased death transcendence. 
However, at the 26-week post-dose 2 final follow-up assessment, 
while death anxiety (as measured by the DAS) continued to 
demonstrate no significant reductions, there was a significant 
improvement in attitudes and adaptations towards death (as 
measured by the DTS) in the psilocybin first group compared to 
the niacin first group (assessed at 2 weeks post-dose 1).
Supplementary Table 2 shows participant ratings of persisting 
effects attributed to the session experiences. As shown, prior to 
the crossover, psilocybin produced significantly greater ratings 
(compared to the niacin first group assessed at 2 weeks post-dose 
1) of positive persisting effects on: attitudes about life and self, 
mood changes, social effects (e.g. increased altruism), behavior, 
and spirituality. After the crossover, these effects were sustained at 
the final 6.5-month follow-up. When all participants were asked 
(26 weeks post-session 2) to reflect on what they thought was 
their psilocybin session, 52% and 70% rated the psilocybin expe-
rience as the singular or top 5 most spiritually significant, or the 
singular or top 5 most personally meaningful experience of their 
entire lives, respectively; while 87% reported increased life satis-
faction or wellbeing attributed to the experience (Figure 6 (top)).
Mystical experience subjective effects and 
relationship of mystical experience to clinical 
outcomes
Compared to the control, psilocybin produced mystical-type 
experiences, consistent with prior trials of psilocybin administra-
tion in normal volunteers (Griffiths et al., 2006, 2008, 2011) and 
patients with terminal cancer (Grob et al., 2011) (Figure 7 (top)). 
Total mystical experience scores (MEQ 30) at the end of dose 1 
(e.g. 7 hours post-drug administration) correlated with change 
scores (baseline to 6 weeks after dose 1) on four out of six pri-
mary outcome measures: HADS T (Spearman r=0.39; P=0.04); 
HADS A (Spearman r=0.36; P=0.07); HADS D (Spearman 
r=0.30; P=0.11); BDI (r=0.49; P=0.01); STAI S (r=0.42; 
P=0.03); STAI T (r=0.39; P=0.04).
Partial correlations to control for participant-rated intensity of 
drug effect (item 98 from the HRS) continued to demonstrate 
significant effects of total mystical experience scores (MEQ 
total) on the change scores (baseline to 6 weeks after dose 1) of 
the primary outcome measures in five of six measures assessed: 
HADS T (Spearman r=0.49; P=0.009); HADS A (Spearman 
r=0.46; P=0.01); HADS D (Spearman r=0.35; P=0.07); BDI 
(r=0.48; P=0.01); STAI S (r=0.42; P=0.03); STAI T (r=0.40; 
P=0.04).
MEQ total scores mediated (indirect effects) a significant por-
tion of the effect of psilocybin versus niacin treatment on four out 
of six primary outcome measures with point estimates (ab) and 
bias corrected 95% CIs as follows: (HADS T (ab=0.46, SE=0.24, 
95% CI 0.01–0.97), HADS D (ab=0.43, SE=0.32, 95% CI 0.01–
1.23), BDI (ab=0.79, SE=0.26, 95% CI 0.23–1.29), and STAI S 
(ab=0.65, SE=0.25, 95% CI 0.13–1.16)] (Figure 7 (bottom)). 
Thus, the amount by which ΔHADS T, ΔHADS D, ΔBDI, and 
ΔSTAI S can be expected to increase through MEQ total as a 
result of psilocybin versus niacin treatment is 0.46, 0.43, 0.79 
and 0.65, respectively.
For other analyses of secondary outcome measures, see 
Supplementary Results.
Discussion
Primary outcomes
Single moderate-dose psilocybin, in conjunction with psycho-
therapy, produced rapid, robust, and sustained clinical benefits in 
terms of reduction of anxiety and depression in patients with life-
threatening cancer. This pharmacological finding is novel in psy-
chiatry in terms of a single dose of a medication leading to 
immediate anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects with enduring 
(e.g. weeks to months) clinical benefits. Even though it is not 
possible to attribute causality of the experimental drug (in terms 
of sustained clinical benefit) after the crossover, the post-crosso-
ver data analyses of the two dosing sequences suggest that the 
clinical benefits, in terms of reduction of cancer-related anxiety 
and depression, of single-dose psilocybin (in conjunction with 
psychotherapy) may be sustained for longer than 7 weeks post-
dosing, and that they may endure for as long as 8 months post-
psilocybin dosing. The acute and sustained anti-depressant 
effects of psilocybin in this trial are consistent with a recently 
published open-label study of oral psilocybin treatment in 
patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in which psil-
ocybin (25 mg) was associated with 1 week and 3 months post-
psilocybin anti-depressant effects (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016).
The within-group analyses for the primary outcome measures 
demonstrate that immediately after receiving psilocybin there is 
a marked reduction in anxiety and depression scores for both the 
psilocybin first and niacin first groups. Also, the magnitude of 
psilocybin-induced change across each participant’s active 
 1176 
Journal of Psychopharmacology 30(12) 
psilocybin treatment session did not differ across treatment group 
for any of the primary outcome measures. Together, this suggests 
that the pharmacological/psilocybin intervention produced rapid 
anti-depressant and anxiolytic clinical benefits. Both groups 
demonstrated significant clinical improvements in anxiety/
depression from baseline relative to the final assessment. It is 
unclear from the data whether the sustained benefits in clinical 
outcomes were due to psilocybin alone or some interactive effect 
of psilocybin plus the targeted psychotherapy. Future research 
would be necessary to separate out the various therapeutic contri-
butions of psilocybin versus psychotherapy.
Psilocybin was associated with substantial anti-depressant 
response rates (as high as approximately 80% at 6.5 months fol-
low-up). There have been several meta-analyses of placebo con-
trolled trials exploring the efficacy of anti-depressants in the 
treatment of cancer-related depression and they have generally 
failed to show a clear effect of anti-depressant treatment over 
placebo (Iovieno et al., 2011; Laoutidis and Mathiak, 2013; 
Ostuzzi et al., 2015). In a meta-analyses of anti-depressants for 
major depressive disorder in patients with comorbid medical dis-
orders (including cancer), anti-depressants were more effective 
than placebo in some medical conditions (e.g. HIV/AIDS, post-
stroke) but not in cancer patients, where the anti-depressants per-
formed about as well as the approximately 40% placebo response 
rate (Iovieno et al., 2011).
Secondary outcomes
Psilocybin decreased cancer-related demoralization (e.g. loss of 
meaning/hope/purpose, desire for hastened death) and hopeless-
ness, while improving spiritual wellbeing, general life satisfac-
tion, and quality of life. While a minority of patients with 
advanced or terminal cancer experience clinically relevant exis-
tential/spiritual distress, when it occurs its effects are highly con-
sequential (e.g. decreased quality of life, increased depressive 
and anxiety symptoms, increased desire for hastened death, 
increased suicidal ideation and behaviors) (Puchalski, 2012) and 
improving spiritual wellbeing (e.g. through a pharmacological-
psychosocial intervention) could serve as a buffer against these 
negative clinical outcomes.
Although affect/anxiety towards death did not improve in the 
short-term or longer-term follow-up period, psilocybin was asso-
ciated with improved attitudes and adaptations to death at the 
6.5-month follow-up. More research into this important thera-
peutic area is warranted.
Psilocybin experiences were reported as highly meaningful 
and spiritual, and associated with positive cognitive, affective, 
spiritual, and behavioral effects lasting weeks to months. This 
finding is consistent with prior research administering psilocybin 
to normal volunteers (Doblin, 1991; Griffiths et al., 2006, 2008, 
2011; Pahnke, 1963).
Safety/adverse events
There were no serious AEs, either medical or psychiatric, in the 
trial that were attributed to psilocybin. Since the early 1990s, 
approximately 2000 doses of psilocybin (ranging from low to 
high doses) have been safely administered to humans in the 
United States and Europe, in carefully controlled scientific 
settings, with no reports of any medical or psychiatric serious 
AEs, including no reported cases of prolonged psychosis or HPPD 
(Studerus et al., 2011). This finding is consistent with a US popu-
lation (2001–2004 data from the National Survey on Drug Use 
and Health) based study that found no associations between life-
time use of any of the serotoninergic psychedelics (including 
psilocybin) and increased rates of mental illness (Krebs and 
Johansen, 2013). It is important to monitor closely for the emer-
gence of transient difficult psychological states (e.g. anxiety, para-
noia) in these trials and to manage them. Difficult experiences are 
not necessarily pathological and can be understood as part of the 
therapeutic process (e.g. working through cancer-related psycho-
logical or existential distress through challenging encounters or 
emotionally charged confrontations with cancer-related fearful 
imagery or symbolism) (Carbonaro et al., 2016).
Limitations/generalizability
This trial was limited by a relatively small sample size, a non-
nationally representative cancer patient population (e.g. 62% 
women, 90% Caucasian), which decreases generalizability, a 
crossover design that limited the interpretation of clinical bene-
fits after the crossover, and the use of a control with limited 
blinding.
Potential anxiolytic and anti-depressant 
mechanisms of psilocybin
Neurobiological mechanisms. There is evidence from animal 
research that serotoninergic psychedelics exert anxiolytic-like 
effects (Nichols, 2015). Several trials using animal models of 
anxiety demonstrated acute anxiolytic effects of the serotoniner-
gic psychedelic 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI), a 
non-selective 5-HT2a/2c agonist (Nic Dhonnchadha et al., 2003; 
Ripoll et al., 2005, 2006). In two rodent studies, one with 5HT2A 
knockout mice (Weisstaub et al., 2006) and the other in rats with 
anti-sense-mediated 5HT2A downregulation (Cohen, 2005), the 
rodents displayed decreased anxiety-like behavior and in the trial 
with the 5HT2A knockout mice (Weisstaub et al., 2006), restora-
tion of 5HT2A receptors in the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) re-estab-
lished anxiety-like behaviors. Furthermore, in humans, 
fronto-limbic 5HT2A density has been correlated with anxiety 
symptoms (Frokjaer et al., 2008). Together, these data suggest 
that 5HT2A downregulation may explain some of the rapid and 
sustained anxiolytic effects of psilocybin (Vollenweider and 
Kometer, 2010).
There is growing evidence that the serotoninergic psyche-
delics produce rapid and sustained anti-depressant effects 
(Nichols, 2015). In two recently published open-label trials, one 
using a single dose of ayahuasca (Osorio et al., 2015) and the 
other using two doses of oral psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 
2016), acute and enduring anti-depressant effects were reported. 
In addition to these two open-label trials, there are several lines 
of evidence supporting using 5HT2A agonists to treat depression. 
In considering changes at the 5HT2A receptor as a potential 
mechanism of action: cortical 5HT2A receptor expression is 
increased in postmortem samples of patients with depression 
who display suicidality (Mendelson, 2000; Pandey et al., 2002; 
Shelton et al., 2009); depressed patients with elevated pessimism 
 Ross et al. 
1177
display increased PFC 5HT2A receptor binding compared to 
control participants (Bhagwagar et al., 2006; Meyer, 2012; Meyer 
et al., 2003); and sustained treatment with various anti-depres-
sants (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic anti-
depressants) have been associated with a reduction of 5HT2A 
receptor density (Gomez-Gil et al., 2004; Yamauchi et al., 2006).
The glutamate system may explain some of the anti-depres-
sant effects of psilocybin. In rodents, serotoninergic psychedelics 
enhance cortical glutamatergic transmission, especially in the 
medial PFC, and increase activation of cortical α-amino-3-
hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors 
(Aghajanian and Marek, 1997). In a trial in which rats received 
DOI, there was a significant increase in expression of brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA in neocortical areas 
(Vaidya et al., 1997). Increased AMPA activation and BDNF 
expression as biomarkers of anti-depressant effects are supported 
by: cortical AMPA activation is known to stimulate the expres-
sion of cortical BDNF (associated with neuronal growth, differ-
entiation and synaptogenesis) (Hsu et al., 2015); decreased 
cortical BDNF is associated with major depression in humans 
(Duman, 2004); and cortical BDNF normalizes with anti-depres-
sant treatment (Sen et al., 2008; Shimizu et al., 2003). Similarly, 
ketamine (the only other known acute and short-term sustained 
anti-depressant) is theorized to exert its anti-depressant effects 
via cortical AMPA activation (Zanos et al., 2016) and BDNF 
expression (Lepack et al., 2014). However, the anti-depressant 
effects of single-dose ketamine in patients with TRD typically 
last no more than several days up to 1–2 weeks, not several weeks 
to months (DeWilde et al., 2015).
Neuroimaging research with psilocybin is beginning to sug-
gest potential anti-depressant mechanisms of action at the level 
of brain structure activity and network connectivity. Task-free 
functional magnetic resonance imaging research in normal vol-
unteers under the influence of psilocybin has demonstrated 
decreased activity in the medial PFC and decreased connectivity 
within the default mode network (DMN) (Carhart-Harris et al., 
2012, 2014). The former is significant because depressive symp-
toms have been associated with increased activity in the medial 
PFC (Drevets et al., 2008; Farb et al., 2011) and normalization of 
medial PFC activity has been demonstrated with anti-depressant 
treatment (Deakin et al., 2008; Holtzheimer and Mayberg, 2011; 
Kennedy et al., 2007); and the latter because patients with major 
depression (compared to controls) have demonstrated increased 
DMN connectivity (Berman et al., 2011, Grecius et al., 2007).
Psycho-spiritual mechanisms. Moderate-dose psilocybin occa-
sioned mystical-type experiences in the cohort of cancer patients 
studied, and the intensity of the subjective mystical experience sig-
nificantly mediated (e.g. suggestive of causality) clinical benefit 
(e.g. reduction in anxiety and depression symptoms) in the medium 
term (e.g. 6 weeks post-dose 1). This result matches with descrip-
tive historical data from open-label LSD-assisted psychotherapy 
trials for psycho-spiritual distress associated with terminal cancer, 
in which the mystical experience was reported as being an integral 
part of the therapeutic effect (Grof and Halifax, 1977). It is further 
corroborated by recent open-label trials using psilocybin-assisted 
psychotherapy to treat tobacco addiction (Garcia-Romeu et al., 
2014; Johnson et al., 2014) and alcoholism (Bogenschutz et al., 
2015) showing significant correlations between the mystical expe-
rience and improved clinical outcomes.
This finding suggests a potential psycho-spiritual mechanism 
of action: the mystical state of consciousness. The mystical expe-
rience is likely to be one of several mediators that transmit the 
effect of psilocybin to changes in anxiety and/or depression. 
Further enquiry into how particular dimensions of the mystical 
experience relate to reductions in anxiety and/or depression in 
this population and others, and what factors best predict or pro-
mote mystical experiences, is warranted.
Conclusions
In conclusion, single moderate-dose psilocybin (in conjunction 
with psychotherapy) was safely administered to a cohort of 
patients with cancer-related psychological distress (e.g. anxi-
ety, depression). It produced rapid and sustained anxiolytic and 
anti-depressant effects (for at least 7 weeks but potentially as 
long as 8 months), decreased cancer-related existential dis-
tress, increased spiritual wellbeing and quality of life, and was 
associated with improved attitudes towards death. The psilocy-
bin-induced mystical experience mediated the anxiolytic and 
anti-depressant effects of psilocybin. Psilocybin, administered 
in conjunction with appropriate psychotherapy, could become 
a novel pharmacological-psychosocial treatment modality for 
cancer-related psychological and existential distress. Further 
empirical research is needed definitively to establish its safety 
and efficacy.
