Reduction in adolescent depression after contact with 
mental health services: a longitudinal cohort study in the UK
Sharon A S Neufeld, Valerie J Dunn, Peter B Jones, Tim J Croudace, Ian M Goodyer
Summary
Background Evidence regarding the association between service contact and subsequent mental health in adolescents 
is scarce, and previous findings are mixed. We aimed to longitudinally assess the extent to which depressive symptoms 
in adolescents change after contact with mental health services.
Methods As part of a longitudinal cohort study, between April 28, 2005, and March 17, 2010, we recruited 
1238 14-year-old adolescents and their primary caregivers from 18 secondary schools in Cambridgeshire, UK. 
Participants underwent follow-up assessment at months 18 and 36. Trained researchers assessed the adolescents 
for current mental disorder using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children 
Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL). Caregivers and adolescents reported contact with mental health 
services in the year before baseline. Adolescents self-reported depressive symptoms (Mood and Feelings 
Questionnaire [MFQ]) at each timepoint. We assessed change in MFQ sum scores from baseline contact with 
mental health services using multilevel mixed-effects regression adjusted for sociodemographic, environmental, 
individual, and mental health confounders, with multiple imputation of missing data. We used propensity score 
weighting to balance confounders between treatment (users of mental health services) and control (non-users of 
mental health services) groups. We implemented an MFQ clinical cutoff following the results of receiver operating 
characteristic analysis.
Findings 14-year-old adolescents who had contact with mental health services in the past year had a greater decrease 
in depressive symptoms than those without contact (adjusted coefficient –1·68, 95% CI –3·22 to –0·14; p=0·033). By 
age 17 years, the odds of reporting clinical depression were higher in individuals without contact than in service users 
who had been similarly depressed at baseline (adjusted odds ratio 7·38, 1·73–31·50; p=0·0069).
Interpretation Our findings show that contact with mental health services at age 14 years by adolescents with a mental 
disorder reduced the likelihood of depression by age 17 years. This finding supports the improvement of access to 
adolescent mental health services.

Introduction
Many mental disorders emerge during adolescence 
and continue into adulthood.1 In depressive disorders, 
younger onset is associated with more depressive 
episodes, longer episode duration, increased co 
morbidity, 
suicidality, and admission to hospital.2 Among individuals 
with a diagnosed depressive disorder, adolescents are 
more likely than adults to delay contact with mental 
health services, thereby increasing episode duration and 
risk of recurrence. Clearly, early identification and 
treatment of mental disorders during adolescence 
would contribute to reduction and perhaps prevention of 
adverse sequelae.
Measurement of the treatment gap—the discrepancy 
between disorder prevalence and proportion treated—is 
a prerequisite to enable policy makers to prevent such 
adverse sequelae from arising. To predict service need, a 
clearly recognised cutoff for mental disorder, such as 
meeting DSM diagnostic criteria, is desirable. Our review 
of international studies that report DSM-IV disorder and 
past-year contact with mental health services for those 
with a disorder (appendix pp 1, 2), found that 12–25% of 
adolescents have a mental disorder, of whom only 
34–56% access mental health services. Previous surveys3,4 
in the UK report much higher proportions of contact 
with mental health services (71% of children or 
adolescents with a mental disorder); however, unlike 
most studies, these estimates classify seeking help from 
a teacher as a mental health service contact. Other 
studies5,6 report 12–19% lower service use rates for anxiety 
than for depression.
The association between adolescents’ contact with 
mental health services and subsequent mental health 
remains unclear in community samples, but is vital to 
clarify if adolescent mental health services are to compete 
for health-care funding. Findings from studies7,8 using 
broad definitions of mental health problems without a 
cutoff for service need have shown that use of mental 
health services had little effect on subsequent mental 
health problems. However, results are more promising if

adolescents are at greater risk of, or already have, a mental 
disorder. In adolescents who witnessed community 
violence, use of mental health services reduced depressive 
symptoms.9 Adolescents with fearful spells or panic 
attacks were more likely to develop diagnosable panic 
disorder and depression if they had not used mental 
health services.10 Patients treated for emotional disorders 
at Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) 
showed 
significant 
improvement 
compared 
with 
controls,11 yet this change was not clinically meaningful. 
Finally, among DSM-diagnosed adolescents, users of 
specialist mental health services had reduced symptoms 
compared with those who were untreated, but only if 
eight or more sessions were attended.12 However, none of 
the studies that showed a positive association between 
service contact and mental health addressed non-
randomisation or attrition. Only one study9 adequately 
addressed confounding variables (ie, those associated with 
both predictor and outcome, which could bias the 
association between service use and subsequent mental 
health), and only one study10 showed significant effects 
that were clinically relevant.
In the present study, we used a longitudinal 
repeated-measures design on a community ascertained 
cohort to assess change in adolescent depressive 
symptoms from ages 14 years to 17 years after contact 
with mental health services. For the outcome, we used 
depressive symptoms as a valid identifier of major 
depressive disorders,13,14 which are highly prevalent5 and 
predictive of future morbidity.2 To extend this previous 
work, the design controls for differences in symptoms 
and background factors among service users and non-
users at baseline and over time, in individuals with and 
without a DSM-defined mental disorder. We hypothesised 
that self-reported depression scores would be reduced to 
a greater extent in adolescents who contacted mental 
health services than in those with no contact, but that 
these effects would be stronger in the subsample with a 
clearly defined need for mental health services, based on 
the presence of a diagnosable mental disorder. We

Evidence before this study
In 2015, a task force in the UK noted the paucity of good quality 
national information regarding Child and Adolescent Mental 
Health Services (CAMHS) outcomes. To identify previous 
published work, with no language restrictions, that assessed the 
association between CAMHS use and subsequent mental health, 
we searched PubMed (* denotes wildcard) for articles published 
in the past 16 years (from Jan 1, 2000, to July 5, 2016) for the 
terms (service* OR help-seek*) AND (psychopatholog* OR 
mental* OR psychiatric*) AND (observation* OR community OR 
survey OR cohort OR epidemiolog*) AND (longitudinal[Title] OR 
prospective[Title] OR change[Title] OR reduc*[Title] OR 
improve*[Title] OR effectiveness[Title] OR outcome[Title]) AND 
(adolescen*[Title] OR youth*[Title] OR young*[Title]). 
We required studies to reflect treatment-as-usual mental health 
service use, and have a non-service using comparison group. 
We identified additional papers by checking citations.
We identified six studies that yielded mixed findings regarding 
the association of service contact with subsequent mental 
health. Two studies that assessed change in all service users 
without a clearly recognised cutoff for service need, such as 
DSM, showed that mental health service use had little effect on 
subsequent total mental health problems over and above that 
to be expected from natural remission. The four remaining 
studies assessed adolescents at greater risk of a mental disorder 
or those with a DSM diagnosis. These studies showed an 
improvement in mental health following service contact, but 
none addressed non-randomisation of service contact or 
attrition, only one adequately addressed confounding variables, 
and only one showed significant effects that were clinically 
relevant. None of these studies were from the UK (three were 
from the USA and three were from Europe).
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind in the UK, and 
the first to support the association of mental health service 
contact and the improvement of mental health by late 
adolescence, while addressing non-randomisation of service 
contact and attrition. In addition to propensity score weighting 
(which balances treatment and control groups on confounders, 
similar to a randomised control trial) to adjust for participants’ 
initial likelihood to access services, and multiple imputation to 
deal with missing data, we used a clinically relevant cutoff and 
adjusted for a wide range of time-varying confounding 
variables. These adjustments give greater confidence than 
previous studies to the notion that mental health service contact 
is related to meaningful improvements in subsequent mental 
health. This study is also the first we are aware of that shows 
that the association of mental health with previous treatment is 
attenuated if that treatment was irrespective of service need.
Implications of all the available evidence
The spending of the UK National Health Service (NHS) on 
children’s mental health services has fallen by 5·4% in real terms 
since 2010 (£41 million), despite an increase in demand. The 
present findings support the positive role played by mental health 
services in a cohort before these NHS cuts, illustrating to policy 
makers the validity of increasing the availability of child mental 
health services to at least 2010 levels. That positive findings 
became non-significant upon inclusion of all mental health 
service users irrespective of disorder underscores the importance 
of clinical assessment when making referral decisions. These 
findings support training of service referrers (eg, in primary care or 
schools) in detection of the presenting features of mental 
disorders, to increase the proportion of referrals of individuals 
with a clear need who could be more responsive to treatment.

hypothesised that these findings would remain when 
we addressed attrition, confounding variables, non-
randomisation of mental health service contact, and 
clinical relevance.
Methods
Study design and participants
As part of the ROOTS longitudinal cohort study15 of mental 
health, between April 28, 2005, and March 17, 2010, we 
recruited 1238 adolescents and primary caregivers 
(1134 [92%] were the biological mother of the adolescent) 
from 27 secondary schools in Cambridgeshire, UK. 
18 secondary schools approached agreed to participate, with 
letters of invitation sent until the sample size reached a 
prespecified cutoff of 1000 participants. Of a possible 
3762 students, 1238 agreed to participate. Participants were 
interviewed separately and completed questionnaires 
at mean ages 14·5 years (timepoint 1 [T1]), 16 years 
(timepoint 2 [T2]), and 17·5 (timepoint 3 [T3]) years 
(T1–3 means, SDs 0·3). Written informed consent was 
obtained from adolescents and caregivers before partici-
pation. Cambridgeshire 2 Research Ethics Committee local 
ethics committee provided ethics approval.
Procedures
At T1, trained researchers assessed adolescents’ mental 
health status using the Schedule for Affective Disorders 
and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children–Present and 
Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL)16 to establish DSM-IV17 
axis 1 diagnoses. Adolescents with a high clinical index 
(subthreshold for diagnosis, but exhibiting four symptoms 
and clinical impairment) were classified as diagnosed. 
Experienced psychiatrists (IMG, PBJ) trained interviewers 
and conducted consensus meetings regarding all K-SADS 
assessments. Inter-rater agreement for diagnosis was 
high (95%). Disagreements were settled by clinical 
consensus meetings between clinical psychiatry experts.
Mental health service contact was defined as an 
adolescent’s assessment or treatment of a mental health 
problem by a primary care provider (ie, general practitioner) 
or a mental health specialist from any sector. Caregiver and 
adolescent responses were obtained by use of various 
measures (items in appendix pp 3–5). T1 past-year mental 
health service contact (no or yes) was generated as an 
exposure variable, and any mental health services after T1 
(no or yes, post-T1–3) as a confounder. Caregivers reported 
contacts with adolescent mental health services at T1 
from a semi-structured interview, with high inter-rater 
agreement on core indicators (κ=0·7–0·9; Cambridge 
Early Experiences Interview18) and from a self-reported 
questionnaire at T1 and T3. Adolescents were interviewed 
at T3 about mental health service contact before 
K-SADS-PL assessment. Adolescents also reported how 
often they had seen a doctor or other health professional 
regarding depressive symptoms in the past month 
(Kessler’s Psychological Distress Scale19). We combined 
adolescent and caregiver responses with either response if 
one was missing, or with the positive response if sources 
disagreed (considering differential recall and caregivers 
potentially unaware of adolescent service use).
A combined variable was derived at T1 that defined 
participants with current mental disorder (yes or no) and 
past-year mental health service contact. This variable 
resulted in four levels: unaffected (no current disorder or 
past-year service contact), service contact only, disorder 
only, and disorder and service contact.
We assessed the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire 
(MFQ)20 at T1–3. This 33-item adolescent self-report of 
current or past 2 weeks’ depressive symptoms covers 
DSM criteria for major depressive disorders. The 
MFQ has shown prognostic validity in clinic and non-
clinic samples,13,14 yielding high internal consistency 
(α=0·92–0·94) in the present sample. Higher sum 
scores indicate more symptoms.
We chose 18 putative confounders that covered 
sociodemographic, environmental, individual, mental 
health, and diagnostic domains (appendix pp 7, 8) based 
on a previous association with mental health service 
contact, or depression. For example, family structure, 
functioning and mental health problems, peer support, 
maltreatment, stressful events, socioeconomic status, 
gender, past referrals for mental health problems, current 
diagnosis type, severity, and comorbidity have all been 
related to current mental health service contact.21 We 
assessed seven confounders at multiple timepoints 
(appendix p 9).
Statistical analysis
We did primary analyses on an imputed dataset (appendix 
pp 7, 8) of individuals with complete data for T1 past-year 
mental health service contact and current mental 
disorder.
Imputed longitudinal MFQ scores were the outcome in 
multilevel mixed-effects linear regression models with 
maximum likelihood estimation, implemented in 
STATA 13.0. This analysis nests correlated data, thereby 
accounting for violations in the assumption of 
independence. For the present data, repeated assessments 
over time were nested within individuals (the random 
effect). Fixed effects (ie, predictors in the regression) 
included linear, quadratic, and categorical effects of age, 
and confounders (appendix p 7). We assessed categorical 
effects of T1 disorder and services (unaffected or disorder 
only or disorder and services) and this variable’s 
interaction with age. We did not include the services-only 
group of individuals in the primary analysis because 
without a mental disorder their need for services was less 
clear. We explored the effects of nesting by school by 
adding school as a further random-effect.
We did receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis 
to determine the ability of MFQ to classify affective 
disorder. In ROC analysis the true positive rate (sensitivity) 
is plotted against the false positive rate (1–specificity). We 
estimated the area under the curve (AUC) and used it as

123
an index of diagnostic accuracy; a higher AUC reflects 
greater accuracy. The MFQ has previously been shown to 
have good-to-high diagnostic accuracy with this method.13,14 
Additionally, MFQ scores above the 75th percentile are an 
established behavioural marker for clinical diagnosis of 
major depression.22 The Youdin Index was calculated to 
determine the clinical cutoff point, because it maximises 
sensitivity and specificity,23 thereby increasing correct 
classification of individuals with and without depression.
To address the absence of randomisation of mental 
health service use, a propensity score was generated to 
weigh the outcome model. A propensity score is the 
individual probability of attending or receiving a service 
or treatment conditional on observed baseline covariates. 
The score is designed to balance confounders between a 
treatment and control group, as is done in a randomised 
control trial.24 The primary propensity-adjusted analyses 
comprised data from adolescents with a mental disorder, 
because those in the disorder-only group were the most 
appropriate for comparison with the disorder-and-
services group (appendix pp 7, 8 provide further details 
of propensity score). To reduce estimate bias, we first did 
analyses of the full sample with a disorder, then we 
restricted the sample to the region of common support—

Data were adjusted as follows: gender, sociodemographics (ethnic origin, Index of Multiple Deprivation, adolescent living with biological parents), environmental factors (number 
of stressful life events in the past year, current family dysfunction and friendships, any family-focused adversities by T1), and mental health factors (any past Schedule for Affective 
Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children diagnosis, any mental health services after T1, any emotional problems in a family member [past 3 years or present], current 
antisocial traits). Variables not included were any mental health service referral age 0–13 years (p=0·19 in base model) and pubertal status (not a true confounder as p>0·10 and 
ρ<0·10 with predictor). MFQ=Mood and Feelings Questionnaire. T1=timepoint 1 (age 14·5 years). T2=timepoint 2 (age 16 years). T3=timepoint 3 (age 17·5 years).

the range of propensity scores which were observed in 
both treated and untreated individuals.25 We estimated 
the propensity score weighted outcome models with 
generalised linear modelling (GLM) with a logit link, 
with adjustment for post-baseline confounding variables. 
A robust estimator accounted for the sample weighting.
To address the importance of use of a clearly defined 
need for mental health services based on the presence of 
a mental disorder, we reanalysed data including all 
service users, irrespective of disorder.

Results
Of the 1238 participants recruited, 1190 adolescents had 
data for T1 current mental disorder and past-year mental 
health service contact (appendix p 6). The number of 
respondents with complete data for all outcomes and 
covariates at all timepoints was 983 (83%) for T1, 
717 (60%) for T2, and 769 (65%) for T3. 64 (5%) adoles-
cents made past-year contact with mental health services; 
126 (11%) had a current mental disorder. Among 
individuals with a disorder, 48 (38%) reported past-year 
service contact and 46 (96%) of these contacts were based 
on T1 past-year recall; 36 (84%) of 43 of these adolescents 
attended five or more sessions (n=5 had missing data for 
treatment length). In the disorder-and-services group 
(n=48), disorders were affective (n=16 [33%]), anxiety 
(n=10 [21%]), behavioural (n=25 [52%]), and other 
(n=5 [10%]); 14 (29%) of these participants had a comorbid 
K-SADS diagnosis (appendix p 9).
Overall, 16 (25%) of 64 service users had no disorder, 
and differed from the disorder-and-services group: 
baseline MFQ scores were lower in the no-disorder 
group, although with no significant difference between 
groups (coefficient –7·64, 95% CI –15·30 to 0·02; 
p=0·051), and MFQ scores did not change over time 
(coefficient 1·22, –1·01 to 3·44; p=0·28). Adolescents 
with a disorder predominantly accessed CAMHS, 
whereas unaffected adolescents mostly accessed a school 
counsellor (appendix p 11). Unaffected service users 
were less antisocial than service users with a disorder 
(coefficient –3·20, 95% CI 1·10 to 5·29; p=0·0034); 
remaining covariates p>0·062 (means in appendix p 9).
Adolescents with a disorder were substantially more 
impaired than unaffected adolescents across all domains 
of confounders (appendix p 9). When we compared 
adolescents with a disorder by mental health service 
contact, individuals varied mainly in diagnostic factors 
(appendix p 9).
1002 (84%) of 1190 service contacts were reported by 
both adolescents and caregivers, showing 98% agreement 
and high chance-corrected agreement (κ=0·78, 95% CI 
0·71–0·84). The remaining service contacts were based 
on either adolescent or caregiver report.
Findings from adjusted multilevel mixed-effects 
regression analysis revealed that at T1, individuals in 
both the disorder only and disorder-and-services groups 
had significantly higher MFQ scores than did those in 
the unaffected group, but scores between the disorder 
only and disorder-and-services groups did not differ 
significantly (table 1, figure). MFQ scores in both these 
groups improved over time compared with the 
unaffected group, in which scores remained stable; 
however, scores improved more quickly among the 
disorder-and-services group than the disorder-only 
group (table 1, figure). By T3, scores in the disorder-and-
services group had improved (reported reduced 
symptoms) to the levels of those in the unaffected group 
(table 1, figure). By contrast, at T3, patients in the 
disorder-only 
group

significantly 
more 
symptoms than did those in both the disorder-and-
services group and the unaffected group (table 1). 
Analyses repeated on complete case data yielded similar 
results (table 1; appendix p 12 shows imputed and 
complete-case analysis results from unadjusted models). 
Nesting by school did not affect complete-case results; 
thus, we did not do clustering during imputation. All 
data we present for comparability are non-nested results.
ROC analysis revealed MFQ as an excellent dis-
criminator of affective disorder (AUC=0·93, 95% CI 
0·90–0·96). The Youden Index indicated an MFQ 
clinical cutoff point of 22, with 94% sensitivity and 
79% specificity, greater than previously obtained in a 
similar sample measured with differing cutoff point 
methodology.14
We included nine baseline covariates in the propensity 
score weighting (table 2). Propensity score weighted

GLM revealed that among adolescents with a mental 
disorder, those without contact with mental health 
services at T1 had nearly four times the odds of being 
depressed by T3 compared with those in the disorder-
and-services group (table 2). Inclusion of post-baseline 
confounding variables increased odds by more than 
five times, and in the common support sample, to more 
than seven times (table 2). Data for propensity score 
covariates were missing for five (4%) of 124 adolescents 
with a disorder. To assess the effect of MFQ imputation 
and missing covariate data on findings, we did 
unweighted GLM with mental health service contact at 
T1 predicting T3 MFQ clinical cutoff (adjusted by 
T1 MFQ only) in three separate models: model A (raw 
MFQ [n=95]), model B (imputed MFQ [n=124]), and 
model C (imputed MFQ with missing data from 
propensity score weighted covariates [n=119]). Effect 
sizes (calculated from odds ratios26) for mental health 
service contact in these models were similar (0·44 for 
model A, 0·46 for model B, and 0·45 for model C), 
indicating no effect of imputation or missing data.
We repeated analyses by expanding the treatment 
group to include all adolescents who had made past-year 
contact with mental health services at T1, including 
16 individuals with no T1 mental disorder. Comparison 
groups remained the same as before. The multilevel 
mixed-effects regression required the same confounding 
variables as the primary analyses, yielding equivalent 
results for the unaffected group compared with the other 
groups. Although this treatment group had the equivalent 
T1 MFQ to the disorder-only group (coefficient –0·94, 
95% CI –3·81 to 1·93; p=0·52) as in the primary analyses, 
the two groups did not differ in their rate of change over 
time (linear coefficient –0·68, –2·07 to 0·70; p=0·33; 
quadratic coefficient –0·27, –0·74 to 0·20; p=0·26). 
Results did not differ significantly with propensity score 
weighted GLMs (table 2, appendix pp 7, 8).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the first in adolescents to 
support the role of contact with mental health services 
in improving mental health by late adolescence, while 
addressing non-randomisation and attrition. Four 
similar studies9–12 did not address these issues; only one 
study9 adequately controlled for confounding variables, 
and one other study10 showed significant effects that were 
clinically relevant. Two studies11,12 only assessed specialist 
mental health services, and one study12 reported effects of 
services only if eight or more sessions were attended. In 
the present study, we considered mental health services 
from all sectors irrespective of treatment length, we 
multiply imputed missing data, used propensity score 
weighting to adjust for participants’ initial likelihood to 
access services, and data yielded clinically relevant results 
robust to a wide range of confounds. Contact with mental 
health services appeared to be of such value that after 
3 years the levels of depressive symptoms of service users 
with a mental disorder were similar to those of unaffected 
individuals. Among adolescents with a mental disorder 
at age 14 years, the odds of those without past-year 
contact with mental health services having clinical 
depression by age 17 years were greater than for service 
users who had been similarly depressed at baseline. 
Recruitment of participants from the general population, 
who vary in diagnosis type, severity, and treatment type, 
and the absence of strict inclusion criteria as in 
randomised controlled trials also increases the external 
validity of our study, especially for public mental health 
and policy makers in the field of community and 
specialised youth services.

Our findings are in contrast with the null8 or negative7 
association of mental health services reported with 
longitudinal total emotional and behavioural problems, 
with no diagnostic threshold. These studies defined 
mental health services in a similar manner to the present 
study; one study7 implemented propensity matching 
to address the absence of randomisation. However, 
measurement of total problems irrespective of clinical 
typology might mask potential influences of mental health 
services on emotional or internalising symptoms. Previous 
null findings can also be explained by a disregard to service 
need. The present study’s findings became non-significant 
when all users of mental health services were included in 
the treatment group irrespective of disorder. This outcome 
underscores the importance of assessment, and supports 
training of service referrers (eg, in primary care or schools) 
in the presenting features of mental disorders, to increase 
the proportion of referrals of adolescents with a clear need 
who could be more responsive to treatment. Our findings 
suggest that adolescents accessing mental health services 
without a mental disorder might be less antisocial, but 
with fewer symptoms they could be less likely to improve 
from treatment. Future work should further elucidate 
this group.
Our study has some limitations. First, verification of the 
self-report of mental health service use against medical 
records would have been beneficial; however, findings 
are supported by high caregiver–adolescent agreement 
and similar proportions reported in comparable studies 
in other countries—eg, in adolescents with a DSM-IV 
diagnosis, 34–56% had past-year contact with any mental 
health services and 19–25% had contact with specialist 
mental health services (appendix p 1); the proportions in 
our study were 38% and 22%, respectively (appendix p 11). 
Second, heterogeneous treatment makes speculation 
about a mechanism for improvement difficult. However, 
common features across treatments could have a role; 
for example, listening, advice giving, problem solving, 
being non-judgmental, and being supportive. Larger 
studies assessing service use separately by treatment type 
might reveal relative effectiveness, to aid policy makers in 
determining which services to support. Third, sample 
size prohibited a focus on participants with a depressive 
diagnosis; thus, we included adolescents with any 
DSM diagnosis. However, because adolescents without 
depression are less likely to show change in depression 
related to service contact, inclusion of all diagnoses 
biases the findings to the null. Furthermore, because of 
numbers of participants, we could not do analyses by 
varying treatment lengths. However, the intention-to-treat 
assumption also biases findings to the null; therefore, it is 
noteworthy that an effect of service use was found. Finally, 
although addition of covariates and propensity score 
weighting helped us to address confounding variables, our 
study had no pretreatment baseline. A larger study with 
more longitudinal assessments could allow analysis of 
adolescents initiating service use in a naturalistic setting.12
Although our findings are an encouragement to policy 
makers and commissioners that CAMHS helps to 
improve mental health, such findings cannot be cause 
for complacency. Figures published in 2015 show that 
National Health Service (NHS) spending on children’s 
mental health services in the UK has fallen by 5·4% in 
real terms since 2010 (£41 million), despite an increase 
in demand.27 Audits have shown a resultant increase in 
referrals and waiting times; providers report increasingly 
complex and severe presenting problems, associated with 
longer stays in inpatient facilities.28 The present study 
occurred in a cohort before these NHS cuts, illustrating 
to UK policy makers the importance of increasing 
availability of CAMHS to at least the 2010 levels. Globally, 
in high-income countries, total mental health spending 
represents no more than 6% of governmental health 
expenditures; in many other countries, this figure is less 
than 1%,29 despite mental disorders being one of the 
leading causes of non-communicable disease burden 
worldwide.30 More studies assessing the effectiveness of 
CAMHS are needed28 for children’s mental health to 
compete for government funds.
When mental health services are ramped-up, care 
needs to be taken to reach individuals with mental health 
needs who would typically not access services, 
comprising more than 60% of those with a mental 
disorder in our sample. This approach could include 
increasing community-based services, and ensuring a 
clear access point to mental health services, such as a 
designated individual in every school and primary care 
practice.28 Focused training of such individuals in 
identification of mental disorders could help to prioritise 
access to mental health services for young people with a 
clearly defined need, to the betterment of their mental 
health and wellbeing.
