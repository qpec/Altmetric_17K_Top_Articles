Background-—More than 60% of patients decline participation in cardiac rehabilitation after a myocardial infarction. Options to
improve physical activity (PA) and other risk factors in these high-risk individuals are limited. We conducted a phase 2 randomized
controlled trial to determine feasibility, safety, acceptability, and estimates of effect of tai chi on PA, fitness, weight, and quality of
life.
Methods and Results-—Patients with coronary heart disease declining cardiac rehabilitation enrollment were randomized to a
“LITE” (2 sessions/week for 12 weeks) or to a “PLUS” (3 sessions/week for 12 weeks, then maintenance classes for 12 additional
weeks) condition. PA (accelerometry), weight, and quality of life (Health Survey Short Form) were measured at baseline and 3, 6,
and 9 months after baseline; aerobic fitness (stress test) was measured at 3 months. Twenty-nine participants (13 PLUS and 16
LITE) were enrolled. Retention at 9 months was 90% (LITE) and 88% (PLUS). No serious tai chi–related adverse events occurred.
Significant mean between group differences in favor of the PLUS group were observed at 3 and 6 months for moderate-to-vigorous
PA (100.33 min/week [95% confidence interval, 15.70–184.95 min/week] and 111.62 min/week; [95% confidence interval,
26.17–197.07 min/week], respectively, with a trend toward significance at 9 months), percentage change in weight, and quality of
life. No changes in aerobic fitness were observed within and between groups.
Conclusions-—In this community sample of patients with coronary heart disease declining enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation, a 6-
month tai chi program was safe and improved PA, weight, and quality of life compared with a 3-month intervention. Tai chi could be
an effective option to improve PA in this high-risk population.

A
pproximately 1 of 4 survivors of an acute coronary event
will experience another cardiovascular event or die
within the following 5 years.1,2 This unfavorable prognosis is,
however, avoidable. The aftermath of an acute coronary event
can represent, in fact, a critical window for behavioral
change.3 For example, smoking cessation rates of 60% are
reported in long-term smokers in the period immediately after
a diagnosis of myocardial infarction.4 Physical activity (PA) is
another critical target for post–coronary event behavioral
change. Substantial epidemiological evidence indicates that
PA delays the development of atherosclerosis and is associ-
ated with reduced risk of future coronary events.5,6 Each 1–
metabolic equivalent increase in fitness is associated with a
19% decrease in the risk of cardiovascular mortality.7,8
Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs leverage this critical
window for behavioral change by offering exercise training
and education on coronary risk factor modification and reduce
both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.9–12 Given these
substantial benefits, current guidelines recommend referral to
CR after an acute coronary event, percutaneous coronary
interventions, and coronary bypass surgery.13
The large majority of this high-risk population, however,
misses the opportunity for healthy behavioral changes offered
by the participation in CR, because <40% of eligible patients
join these programs in the United States.14 Older men,
women of all ages, and ethnic minorities are particularly
unlikely to enroll.15 Reasons for nonenrollment include dislike

 of exercise, perception of exercise as tiring or painful, low
exercise capacity, travel distance to the CR center, high
copays, and psychosocial factors, such as depression and low
social support.16–19 In addition, CR programs have high
attrition rates for reasons ranging from the limited number of
available exercise options to the lack of social interactions
during programs.18,20 These discouraging data have prompted
calls
for
the
“design
of
evidence-based,
alternative
approaches to traditional CR that help provide affordable
access to clinically effective secondary prevention interven-
tions (p. 2954).”14
Tai chi, a traditional Chinese martial art based on gentle
body movements accompanied by relaxation and breathing
exercises,21 could be a promising exercise option for patients
not attending CR. First, the exercise intensity during tai chi
can be adjusted by varying session duration, body position
during practice, and training style to meet the needs of elderly
and deconditioned individuals.22 Second, because tai chi is
safe even in high-risk patients,23 it can be offered in
community centers,24,25 thus overcoming transportation bar-
riers associated with CR. Third, tai chi gentle training may be
particularly attractive for women, who are less likely than
men to attend CR and typically dislike the type of exercise
offered at CRs.19 Fourth, tai chi energy expenditure can
reach 4.6 metabolic equivalents (moderate-intensity aerobic
activity)26,27 and has been shown to improve self-reported
PA28–30 and other coronary risk factors.31 Studies have also
suggested that tai chi may improve cardiac fitness.28 Last, the
emphasis placed on breathing and relaxation exercises during
tai chi may improve psychological distress.31 Recent research
has shown that the integration of stress reduction within a
comprehensive CR program results in additional clinical
benefits compared with CR alone.32
To our knowledge, no study has to date evaluated whether
tai chi could be offered as an alternative exercise option for
patients who declined enrollment in CR. In preparation for a
future large efficacy trial, we conducted a phase 2 study to
determine which dose of tai chi is most feasible, acceptable,
and safe (primary outcome) and to obtain preliminary
estimates of effect of each dose on PA and aerobic fitness
(secondary outcomes). Other secondary outcomes included
quality of life (QOL) and body weight.
Methods
Population
Methods for this study have been described in detail
elsewhere.33 Briefly, participants were recruited via flyers
placed in cardiology practices, community centers, and other
public venues; on-line resources; and advertisements on
local radio programs and community newspapers. Because
tai chi was offered in a class format, we recruited 3
consecutive cohorts of participants. Inclusion criteria were
as follows: (1) history of coronary heart disease; (2) ability to
understand and speak English; (3) aged ≥21 years; and (4)
being physically inactive (7 days PA Recall Questionnaire)34
and defined as not meeting current recommendations for
PA35 (ie, 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic PA 5 d/
week or 20 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity 3 d/week).
Exclusion criteria included the following: (1) inability or
unwillingness to give informed consent; (2) unstable angina;
(3) blood pressure >200/110 mm Hg or orthostatic systolic
blood pressure decrease >20 mm Hg; (4) uncontrolled atrial
or ventricular arrhythmias; (5) third-degree AV block; (6)
pericarditis or myocarditis; (7) recent thrombophlebitis; (8)
abnormal stress test result without study cardiologist’s
clearance; (9) medical conditions likely to limit life span to
<1 year; (10) New York Heart Association functional class
IV; (11) severe cognitive impairment (Blessed Orientation-
Memory-Concentration test scores ≥1036); (12) orthopedic
problems prohibiting tai chi practice; (13) ongoing tai chi or
other mind-body training; (14) current enrollment in CR; (15)
severe depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
depression subscale scores, >14); and (16) conditions likely
to affect study compliance (ie, moving out of study area and
substance use).
Once interest and preliminary eligibility were confirmed,
participants were invited for a screening visit. After providing
in-person informed consent, participants completed baseline
assessments and entered a run-in period of 1 week during
which they wore accelerometers for the assessment of
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Compared with a shorter intervention, a 6-month tai chi
exercise intervention was safe, feasible, and enjoyable and
increased moderate-to-vigorous physical activity among
deconditioned patients with coronary heart disease who
had declined enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation.
• Other benefits included weight loss and improvements in
quality of life.
• This is the first study showing that tai chi may improve
exercise behaviors in this high-risk population.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Tai chi is a promising and safe exercise alternative for
patients with coronary heart disease who are unable or
unwilling to attend traditional cardiac rehabilitation.
• If proved effective in larger studies, tai chi could be offered
as an alternative exercise option within existing cardiac
rehabilitation programs or within the context of community-
based rehabilitation programs.

 baseline level of PA and underwent a symptom-limited
exercise stress test for evaluation of cardiac risk37 and
baseline aerobic fitness. A cardiologist (W-C.W.) gave the final
clearance for the participant’s enrollment in the study.
Participants received a $40 stipend at each study visit. The
Rhode Island Hospital (Providence) Institutional Review Board
approved the study protocol (docket 599729).
The randomization schedule (1:1 ratio) was generated in
“R” (http://cran.us.r-project.org)38 on the basis of a per-
muted block randomization procedure using small random-
sized blocks. The allocation table was uploaded to an Access
database; once all assessments were completed, the research
assistant (J.K.) assigned each participant to either condition
by clicking the “randomize” button.
Tai Chi Interventions
Classes were held in a room located in the CR building. For
each cohort, we offered 3 1-hour tai chi classes/week during
weeks 1 to 12. Patients in the LITE (2 sessions/week for
12 weeks) group were invited to come twice a week, and
patients in the PLUS (3 sessions/week for 12 weeks, then
maintenance classes for 12 additional weeks) group were
invited to attend 3 times a week. Participants in the PLUS
group continued with 2 classes weekly during week 13 to 16,
followed by 1 maintenance class every other week (weeks
17–24). Both groups were instructed to practice tai chi at
home at least 3 times per week using a DVD (30-minute
duration) containing the same sequence of tai chi exercises
taught in class. Regardless of dose assignment, the content of
the intervention was identical in the 2 groups.
A panel of experts in CR, cardiovascular prevention, tai chi,
and exercise physiology reviewed the protocol used in
previous studies conducted by our group in patients with
heart failure and chronic obstructive lung disease.29,39 On the
basis of the panel’s recommendations, a tai chi research
expert (P.M.W.) worked with the tai chi instructors (3 certified
instructors with 10+ years’ experience) to modify existing
protocols by increasing aerobic intensity over time (ie, by
gradually adjusting the pace of practices [slightly faster over
time] and depth of stances [slightly lower over time]).33
Intervention fidelity was assessed according to the Treat-
ment Fidelity Workgroup guidelines.40 Tai chi sessions were
video recorded, and the study auditor (P.M.W.) reviewed 10%
of videos for protocol consistency using a checklist developed
for the study.
Blinding
Participants were informed they would be randomized to 1 of
2 doses of tai chi and, thus, were not blinded to their dose
allocation. Study personnel, other than the research assistant
responsible for participant randomization and monitoring of
adverse events, were blinded.
Measures
Assessments were performed at baseline and at 3, 6, and
9 months after enrollment. Data were collected using Access
software for direct data entry from study participant into
electronic surveys. Study data were collected between January
2015 and December 2017 and analyzed in March-April 2017.
Primary Outcomes
Indicators of feasibility were retention rates, tai chi session
attendance (recorded by the research assistant at each
session), and individual tai chi home practice (self-reported
using a log to be kept daily and collected in class each week).
Acceptability was evaluated at the end of the intervention
using a self-reported rating scale ranging from 0 (did not like)
to 4 (liked very much).29
For safety, the PA Readiness questionnaire was used to
determine before each session whether the participant had
experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or
muscle injury since the previous class.41 At each study visit,
we collected information about unplanned clinic visits and
hospital readmissions. Adverse events were validated with
information from medical records whenever possible.
Secondary Outcomes
PA was measured using accelerometers. Accelerometers were
not worn during tai chi classes. Measures includes number of
valid days, wear time, min/week of moderate-to-vigorous
intensity PA (MVPA), min/week of MVPA recorded in bouts of
at least 10 minutes, and min/week of light activity. Data were
processed using ActiLife software, with minimum wear time
set at 10 h/d and nonwear time set at 60 minutes. Given the
increased burden associated with participants wearing the
accelerometer for a second week in case of mechanical failure
of the accelerometer, the 7-day PA Recall Questionnaire was
used as a backup.34 Although absolute amounts of PA differ
between these 2 measures, there is a good correlation
between PA Recall Questionnaire and accelerometry collected
data.42
For aerobic fitness, oxygen consumption in metabolic
equivalents was calculated in all patients from stress test
parameters, according to the protocol used in the test.
Formulas for the Bruce Protocol and Modified Bruce Protocol
were based on the American College of Sports Medicine’s
metabolic equations,43,44 which are functions based on sex
and time on the treadmill. Because of logistical problems, we
were able to obtain direct measures of oxygen uptake (VO2) at

 peak exercise (mL/kg per minute) using breath-by-breath
expired gas analysis only in a subset of participants (n=21).
There were no significant differences in baseline demograph-
ics between those with and without a direct measure of VO2
(all P>0.05).
Body weight was measured on a calibrated balance beam
scale. QOL was assessed using a short version (8 items) of
the Health Survey Short Form, a self-reported measure widely
used for routine monitoring and assessment of care outcomes
in adult patients.45
Covariates
included
sociodemographic
characteristics
(age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and income) measured
using validated forms; medical history (coronary risk factors,
coronary revascularization procedures, ejection fraction, New
York Heart Association class, comorbidities, and medica-
tions), abstracted from medical records; body mass index
(calculated as weight [kg]/height [meters squared]); depres-
sion (using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale,46 a
self-administered questionnaire with 2 subscales [score
range, 0–21] measuring anxiety and depression, with higher
scores
indicating
greater
psychological
morbidity);
and
patients’ expectations about the intervention.47 We also
gathered information about reasons for not attending CR
using a questionnaire developed for this study, as in the study
by Dunlay et al.48
Statistical Analyses
All analyses were conducted according to the intention-to-
treat principle (with the exception of the attendance outcome,
for which both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses
were conducted). t Tests, nonparametric tests, and v2 tests,
as applicable, were used to compare between-group baseline
differences as well as retention rates, attendance rates, and
individual home tai chi practice.
Unadjusted average min/week of MVPA over time were
calculated separately by group and between-group differences
in unadjusted mean and median MVPA at each time point and
were tested using t tests and Mann-Whitney tests, respec-
tively. To estimate treatment effects, we used a longitudinal
mixed-effects regression model to simultaneously regress
absolute MVPA (min/week) at each follow-up on treatment
group,
time,
group9time,
and
baseline
MVPA.
Models
included a subject-specific intercept to account for repeated
measures within individual over time. A statistically significant
interaction indicates that between-group differences vary
across time points.49 Contrasts were used to test between-
group differences in MVPA at each follow-up time, controlling
for baseline. Baseline variables that differed between groups
and were predictive of PA were included as covariates in the
multivariate model.50 Because of the large variances in mean
MVPA over time, we attempted to transform towards
normality. Because there were no substantial differences in
the resulting model, we present the untransformed version in
the Results, for ease of interpretation. Similar mixed-effects
models were used to estimate mean between-dose differ-
ences for light activity and other secondary outcomes. All
study analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.3,
statistical software. Before study inception, we established to
deem either dose feasible if at least 80% of participants were
retained at the end of each intervention, if they attended at
least 70% of the planned classes, and if they completed at
least 70% of the prescribed home tai chi exercises. The
intervention was considered acceptable if 80% of participants
rated it a 4 (liked very much).
Results
Participants were on average 67.9 (SD, 10.3) years old, 27%
were female, and 93% were white, with almost two thirds
reporting at least some college education (Table 1). Overall,
this was a high-risk population: half of the study participants
were diabetic, two thirds had high cholesterol levels or
hypertension, more than half were obese, and one third were
smoking at enrollment. More than 60% had a history of
myocardial infarction, and 80% had had a percutaneous
coronary intervention. Although baseline characteristics were
overall balanced by randomization, LITE participants were
slightly older, had a higher body mass index, were less
physically active, and were more likely to have heart failure.
The most common reasons for not having attended CR
included dislike of intensive exercise and the perception that
CR was dangerous (indicated by more than half of study
participants), followed by insurance, scheduling, and trans-
portation issues.
Of the 214 subjects initially contacted, 108 were ineligible,
and 46 were not interested in participating. The most
common reasons for refusal were schedule conflicts and lack
of interest. Of the 33 randomized participants, 4 left the study
immediately after randomization (Figure 1) and 29 started the
intervention (13 in the PLUS group and 16 in the LITE group).
Primary Outcomes
Retention rates were 90% (94% in the LITE group and 88% in
the PLUS group) at the 9-month follow-up visit, with no
significant differences by condition. Three participants were
unavailable for follow-up, and 2 discontinued the intervention
because of serious adverse events but remained in the study.
Among the intention-to-treat sample, 39% of PLUS partici-
pants and 69% of LITE participants attended at least 70% of
planned classes (Table 2). Participants’ ratings showed high
satisfaction, with 95% indicating that tai chi was highly
enjoyable (score, ≥3 on a range of 0–4) and 100% reporting

 they would recommend it to a friend. Average acceptability
scores were similar between conditions (Table 2). Three
serious adverse events were observed (1 in the LITE group
and 2 in the PLUS group); none was related to the tai chi
intervention (Table 3). No cardiac adverse events occurred
during the study. The most common adverse events were
musculoskeletal, and none was deemed related to tai chi
practice.
Secondary Outcomes
Complete accelerometer data were available for all partici-
pants. Unadjusted means of MVPA (min/week) at each time
point are presented in Table 4 and Figure 2. We found
significant between-group differences in mean MVPA at
baseline, 3 months, and 6 months (P=0.04, P=0.04, and
P=0.02, respectively) in favor of the PLUS group. Because PA
outcomes are subject to large variances (particularly in small
samples), we also examined between-group differences in
median MVPA over time. Results suggested significant
differences
in
unadjusted
median
MVPA
at
9 months
(P=0.03).
Regression models adjusting for baseline MVPA and
including subject-specific intercepts indicated significant
treatment effects on mean MVPA at 3 and 6 months favoring
the PLUS groups. Specifically, between-group differences in
MVPA were 100.33 min/week at 3 months (95% confidence
interval [CI], 15.70–184.95 min/week) and 111.62 min/
week at 6 months (95% CI, 26.17–197.07 min/week). Effects
at 9 months trended towards significance (P=0.08) in favor of
the PLUS group. In addition, MVPA did not significantly
decrease between 6 and 9 months in the aggregated sample
(P>0.05). We also tested a model that controlled for
accelerometer wear time and variables not balanced by
randomization, but model fit was not improved and these
variables were removed from the final model.
Unadjusted average maximum VO2 (VO2 max) at baseline
and 3 months is presented in Table 5 (calculated and
measured). As shown by similarly low baseline VO2 max
values, both groups were severely deconditioned, confirming
this was a particularly frail population. There were no
significant between-group differences in calculated VO2 max
at 3 months, controlling for protocol type and baseline
differences between groups (b=0.22; 95% CI, �1.91 to
2.35). For the subset of participants in whom we were able to
obtain direct measures of VO2 max, we also found no
significant between-group difference in mean VO2 max at
3 months, controlling for baseline (b=�0.30; 95% CI, �2.92
to 2.31).
Unadjusted findings for weight and QOL are shown in
Table 6. Longitudinal models suggest significant effects in
favor of the PLUS arm for percentage change in body weight51
at 3 months, controlling for baseline (b=3.31; 95% CI, 0.05–
7.09). Specifically, mean percentage weight loss was higher in
the PLUS group (2.86 kg; SD, 3.35 kg) than in the LITE group
(�0.45 kg; SD, 4.99 kg). Weight loss was maintained from 3
to 9 months.
Models for QOL (where lower scores indicate better QOL)
show a significant difference in favor of the PLUS condition at
3 months (b=�0.69; 95% CI, �1.34 to �0.04). Effects at 6
and 9 months were in the same direction, albeit not
significant (P=0.16 and P=0.27, respectively).
Post Hoc Analyses
Because this population was particularly deconditioned, we
thought it would be important to assess the effect of the
intervention on light activity. Models showed a significant
effect on light activity at 3 and 6 months favoring the PLUS
group (mean between-group differences in light activity were
397.88 [95% CI, 78.50–717.27] min/week and 376.75 [95%
CI, 53.34–700.15] min/week), respectively. We observed a
trend towards significance at 9 months (P=0.09) in favor of
the PLUS arm.
Discussion
In this community-based sample of patients who declined
enrollment in CR, we found that a longer (6-month) tai chi
exercise intervention improved objectively assessed PA,
weight, and QOL compared with a shorter (3-month) inter-
vention. Overall, both interventions were safe, acceptable, and

slightly lower in the PLUS group.
Notably, once patients enrolled in the tai chi program, 90%
were retained until the end of the study; those who dropped out
did so for serious adverse events and not because they disliked
the program. This high retention rate compares favorably with
dropout rates reaching up to 60% in CR.20 With regard to safety,

 indicate that tai chi is safe among deconditioned patients with
coronary heart disease provided that participants are screened
following the same criteria adopted for CR.
We found that participation in a longer tai chi program
improved both moderate and light PA, effects that trended
toward significance at 9 months in the PLUS group. Such a
trend is important because it suggests a more enduring
behavioral change that persisted even when support from the
instructor and group was no longer present. This finding is
particularly remarkable considering that our population was
clearly resistant to behavioral change, as shown by the high
proportion of current smokers and obese individuals in our
study population.
Both fear of exercise and the perception of CR as
dangerous were the most commonly reported reasons for
declining participation in CR. Tai chi can clearly overcome
these barriers because it is a different form of exercise.
During training, participants are constantly reminded they do
not need to strive or struggle to achieve predetermined goals
in terms of heart rate or exercise intensity. Instead, they are
invited to focus their attention on the breath and/or on the
movements of the body. As a result, participants do not see
tai chi exercise as threatening, and this may result in
improvements in exercise self-efficacy. In fact, an analysis of
data from a randomized controlled trial of tai chi for patients
with heart failure has shown that increases in exercise self-
efficacy mediated changes in functional status.52
To our knowledge, this is the first study that examined the
effect of tai chi on objectively assessed PA among patients
not attending CR. One study conducted in outpatients with
class I to III systolic heart failure found that participation in a
12-week tai chi training program improved self-reported PA
(CHAMPS (Community Healthy Activities Model Program for
Seniors/CHAMPS activities questionnaire)) compared with
controls.29 Another study reported similar results with a
slightly longer intervention (16 weeks).30 A second element of
novelty is the use of tai chi as a possible alternative to CR-
based exercise programs. To date, studies have examined the
role of tai chi as an adjunct to CR exercise training,53,54
whereas, to our knowledge, no study has investigated the
possible role of tai chi as an alternative exercise option for
patients not attending traditional CR.
Increasing class frequency (2 versus 3 classes) did not
affect aerobic fitness after 3 months of tai chi training

 compared with baseline. Findings from a recent meta-analysis
suggest that tai chi produces modest improvements in VO2
max28; however, the duration of the tai chi intervention in the
studies included in this meta-analysis ranged from 1 to
4.7 years.55–57 It is possible that the duration of tai chi
training may positively affect aerobic fitness; in fact, it has
been suggested that a longer duration of tai chi training is
needed to affect fitness.58 For logistical reasons, we were
unable to perform a third stress test at intervention comple-
tion among PLUS participants and, thus, we do not know if
aerobic fitness would have increased after 6 months of
training in this group. Furthermore, 1 of the aforementioned
studies55 assessed exercise intensity during steady-state tai
chi performance and found average heart rates exceeding 70%
of the maximal heart rate. Although we did not measure
participants’ heart rate during exercise, another explanation
for our results is that the intensity of tai chi intervention may
not have been sufficient to improve peak VO2. Finally, aerobic
fitness did not improve despite improvements in overall PA.
This finding is not surprising, given that several factors,
including, among others, heritability,59 age and adiposity,60
and smoking,61 influence aerobic fitness in addition to PA.
Our work has several important strengths. First, this was
the first study to examine the effect of tai chi on objectively
measured PA. Second, we were able to enroll a community-
based sample of severely deconditioned, high-risk patients
who had declined enrollment in CR. Third, retention rates at
the end of the study were superior to those commonly
reported in CRs. Last, we included rigorous assessments of
intervention fidelity.
Our study has also some limitations. First, as expected,
given the type of population selected, recruitment was a
challenging aspect of this study. Because these patients had
already declined a recommended treatment (CR), it is not
surprising that they were hard to enroll in a research study of
a new approach. Despite their history of coronary heart
disease, one third of our patients were still smoking and 80%
were overweight or obese, indicating that we were targeting a
high-risk group with high resistance to behavioral change.
Competition with CR in our catchment area was another
problem, because an intensive enrollment campaign was
launched while our study was ongoing. Second, the sample
size was small, which, despite randomization, resulted in
groups being unbalanced for certain baseline characteristics.
However, baseline differences in activity and other charac-
teristics were accounted for in analyses. Third, another

 limitation is the underrepresentation of women and minori-
ties. Fourth, our exercise protocol may not have been intense
enough to increase aerobic fitness. Once participants feel
more confident, improvements in aerobic fitness could be
achieved (eg, by increasing the pace of exercises, modifying
body position during practice [ie, squatting or raising hands
over head], or simply providing patients with a heart rate
monitor to self-monitor pace during practice). Finally, this
study measured only aerobic fitness, whereas other important
determinants of overall physical fitness (eg, balance, agility,
and muscular strength) were not assessed.
Conclusion
In sum, tai chi is a promising and safe exercise alternative for
patients with coronary heart disease who are unable or
unwilling to attend traditional CR, in particular for older
people, women, and deconditioned individuals. If our findings
are confirmed in larger studies, tai chi could be offered either
as an alternative exercise training option within existing CR
programs or within the context of community-based rehabil-
itation programs.
