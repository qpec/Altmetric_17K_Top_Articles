Abstract
 Background—The minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) of 21 has been associated with a 
number of benefits compared to lower MLDAs, including long-term effects, such as reduced risk 
for alcoholism in adulthood. However, no studies have examined whether MLDA during young 
adulthood is associated with mortality later in life. We examined whether individuals exposed to 
permissive MLDA (< 21) had higher risk of death from alcohol-related chronic disease compared 
to those exposed to the 21 MLDA. Because prior work suggests that MLDA affects college 
students differently, we also conducted conditional analyses based on ever having attended 
college.
 Methods—Data from the 1990 through 2010 U.S. Multiple Cause of Death files were 
combined with data on the living population and analyzed. We included individuals who turned 18 
during the years 1967 to 1990, the period during which MLDA varied across states. We examined 
records on death from several alcohol related chronic diseases, employing a quasi-experimental 
approach to control for unobserved state characteristics and stable time trends.
 Results—Individuals who reported any college attendance did not exhibit significant 
associations between MLDA and mortality for the causes of death we examined. However, 
permissive MLDA for those who never attended college was associated with 6% higher odds for 
death from alcoholic liver disease, 8% higher odds for other liver disease, and 7% higher odds for 
lip/oral/pharynx cancers (OR = 1.06, 95% CI [1.02, 1.10]; OR = 1.08, 95% CI [1.02, 1.14]; OR = 
1.07, 95% CI [1.03, 1.12], respectively).
 Conclusions—The 21 MLDA likely protects against risk of death from alcohol-related 
chronic disease across the lifespan, at least for those who did not attend college. This is consistent 
with other work that shows that the long-term association between MLDA and alcohol-related 
outcomes is specific to those who did not attend college.

  Introduction
The minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) in the United States determines the age at which 
individuals may legally purchase and possess alcohol in public. This policy varied by state 
after prohibition and many states reduced their drinking ages to as low as 18 during the 
Vietnam War era (Wagenaar and Toomey, 2002). Following passage of the National 
Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 (23 USC §158) all states adopted an MLDA of 21, a 
process that was complete by 1988 (with the exception of the state of Louisiana, which 
maintained a lower de facto purchase age until 1995; Ponicki, 2004; Scribner and Cohen, 
2001).
Many studies have shown that higher MLDAs are linked to lower rates of motor-vehicle 
fatalities, alcohol consumption, and numerous other adverse alcohol-related outcomes 
among teenagers and adults under the age of 21 (see DeJong and Blanchette, 2014 and 
Wagenaar and Toomey, 2002 for reviews of this extensive literature). A handful of studies 
have also shown that the effects of the MLDA may persist into the early 20s; that is, those 
who were restricted from drinking at ages 18-20 were less likely to report heavy drinking 
episodes after age 21 (Cook and Moore, 2001; Moore and Cook, 1995; O'Malley and 
Wagenaar, 1991). Insofar as MLDA is a proxy for the age at which one has ready access to 
alcohol, this suggests that changes in access during late adolescence could have a persistent 
impact on one's drinking patterns.
The idea that the MLDA has persistent effects is intriguing because of neurobiological 
evidence that adolescence is a critical period during which vulnerability to substance use 
disorders are at their highest (Chambers et al., 2003). Motivated by this theory, recent work 
from our group has suggested that higher MLDAs do appear to have long-term benefit. Birth 
cohorts who were legally restricted from drinking prior to age 21 are less likely to drop out 
of high school, have alcohol use disorder (AUD), and engage in binge drinking behaviors in 
later adulthood (Norberg et al., 2009; Plunk et al., 2015, 2013). A protective cohort effect of 
higher MLDA on risk of death by suicide and homicide among adult women has also been 
suggested (Grucza et al., 2012). Others have shown that higher drinking ages appear to 
confer protection against fatal traffic accidents over the long term among men (Kaestner and 
Yarnoff, 2011). These studies of the long-term consequences of the MLDA have built upon a 
large body of literature showing that early drinking is an important marker, though not 
necessarily a contributing cause, of adult alcohol use disorders (DeWit et al., 2000; Grant 
and Dawson, 1997; Grucza et al., 2008; McGue et al., 2001; Prescott and Kendler, 1999; 
Ystrom et al., 2014). However, results of studies of the MLDA, which functions as a natural 
experiment of legally restricting access to alcohol during late adolescence, suggest that 
reductions in early drinking lead to decreased risk for alcohol problems well into mid-
adulthood.
If ready access to alcohol at a younger age increases risk for alcohol use disorder and heavy 
drinking over the long term, then risk for alcohol-related chronic disease mortality should 
also be affected (Plunk et al., 2014a). In this work we undertake the first examination of the 
possible effects of the MLDA—and, by extension, changes in access to alcohol during a key

 developmental period—on alcohol-related chronic disease mortality. This is significant for 
several reasons. First, there are relatively few studies of the long-term consequences of 
permissive (i.e., < 21) MLDA (DeJong and Blanchette, 2014). More specifically, if we find 
that the MLDA is associated with chronic disease mortality, it would show that MLDA 
policies protect not only adolescents and young adults from the harmful effects of alcohol, 
but that the influence of MLDA on health may last throughout the lifespan. Finally, this 
work is timely as debate about the minimum drinking age continues both in the U.S. and in 
other countries, where some argue that lower drinking ages will lead to safer drinking among 
youth and young adults (e.g., Christiansen, 2010; Cohan, 2014; Metherell, 2009; Paglia, 
2014; Tracy, 2014; Young, 2012).
Our objective was to examine whether the ability to legally purchase alcohol prior to age 21 
is related to increased chronic disease mortality later in life. We propose that permissive 
MLDA, a proxy for ready access to alcohol during the ages of 18-20, influences heavy 
drinking outcomes across the lifespan, which in turn influence mortality risk from chronic 
disease. Since this hypothesized association is indirect we expect to see significant findings 
only for diseases for which risk is substantially attributable to heavy alcohol use. We focused 
on mortality from the following chronic diseases that are in large part (> ~20%) attributable 
to alcohol: liver cirrhosis and other liver disease; cancers of the lip, oral cavity and pharynx; 
laryngeal cancer; and esophageal cancer (Boffetta et al., 2006; Haas et al., 2012; World 
Health Organization, 2014).
In addition to the proportion of mortality attributable to alcohol, other factors are likely to 
influence the magnitude of any potential association between MLDA and risk of death that 
we will be able to observe. First, MLDA exposure is determined by a person's year of birth 
and state of residence between the ages of 18-21, but it is not possible to directly observe 
this from mortality data. Instead, we must rely on subject's state of residence at time of 
observation as a proxy (Krauss et al., 2015; Norberg et al., 2009; Plunk et al., 2015, 2013). 
To determine if this is a reasonable way to estimate policy exposure we conduct a separate 
set of analyses on “likely non-movers.” This subset of the study sample resided in their birth 
state at time of observation and are much less likely to have ever migrated between states. 
Second, some studies have suggested that college campuses may be insulated from the 
effects of drinking age policy; that is, that the mix of legal and non-legal drinkers on school 
campuses provides ready access to alcohol, making youth-access policies like the MLDA 
less effective (Grucza et al., 2009; Johnston et al., 2015; Plunk et al., 2015; Wagenaar and 
Toomey, 2002). To ensure that we are capturing this potential campus insulation effect, we 
examine whether the potential impact of MLDA on chronic disease mortality is stronger 
among those who did not attend college. Thus, in the current study we use nationally 
representative mortality data to test three hypotheses: (1) MLDA is associated with increased 
risk for liver disease and alcohol-related cancers; (2) magnitudes of association are similar 
among likely non-movers, for whom we are less likely to misestimate MLDA policy 
exposure; and (3) the associations between MLDA and alcohol-related chronic disease 
mortality are stronger among individuals who never attended college.

  Methods
 Dependent variables and data sources
Our dependent variables were death due to: alcoholic liver disease; liver disease not 
specified as alcohol-related; cancers of the lip, oral cavity, and pharynx; esophageal cancer; 
and laryngeal cancer. Data on individual deaths in the U.S. were obtained from the Multiple 
Cause-of-Death files for 1990-2010, collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. 
These data are based on all death certificates filed in the U.S. by each state and the District 
of Columbia (Miniño et al., 2011). Files containing individual-level data through 2004 were 
obtained through the National Bureau of Economic Research (http://www.nber.org/data/
multicause.html). For years beyond 2005, state-level geographic identifiers are not included 
in public use files, so customized files including geographic data were obtained by request 
through the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems. 
From the complete set of death records, we selected individuals who died from one of the 
causes of interest based on ICD-9 codes for years 1990-1998 and ICD-10 codes for years 
1999-2010. Codes for each outcome are listed in Table 1. Each analysis included records 
from individuals for whom the cause of interest was listed as a contributing cause of death, 
alongside records from the living population, described below.
To model the living population, we combined data from the annual American Community 
Survey (ACS) for the years 2001-2010, obtained from the Integrated Public Use Microdata 
Series maintained by the Minnesota Population Center (Ruggles et al., 2010). Since the ACS 
was not administered annually prior to 2000 we used data from 1% samples of the 1990 and 
2000 Census to estimate data for years 1991 through 1999 using a linear interpolation 
procedure fully described elsewhere (Grucza et al., 2015, 2009). Briefly, this was 
accomplished by creating a single record for each possible combination of covariate 
parameters in each Census data set (i.e., each combination of year, state, race/ethnicity, sex, 
age group and education) and assigning that record a weight corresponding to the population 
for that group. The weight for the corresponding record during non-observed years was 
estimated as: [(2000-year)*(1990 weight) + (year-1990)*(2000 weight)] / 10). We have 
shown elsewhere that this method is valid by comparing the results with U.S. Census Bureau 
estimates for intracensal years (Grucza et al., 2015). All observed and estimated living 
population data were combined and sample weights were divided by the number of data 
years. The living population data were then combined with the mortality data to create the 
final data set. Because our analytical approach relies on differences in policy exposure 
within birth cohorts, we limited analyses to those who turned 18 during the years 1967 to 
1990 (birth years 1949 to 1972), the period in which the MLDA was in flux.
 Independent variable: MLDA exposure—MLDA policy data were coded as 
described in our previous studies (e.g., Norberg et al., 2009; Plunk et al., 2015, 2013). We 
examined a period during which some states both increased and decreased their MLDAs, 
while others maintained a 21 MLDA throughout. Individuals who were legally permitted to 
purchase alcohol between the ages of 18-20 (i.e., those with “permissive MLDA exposure”) 
were contrasted with those who were restricted until age 21. Individuals who were exposed 
to an MLDA of 18, 19 or 20 were assigned a value of “1” and those who were unable to

 purchase alcohol before the age of 21 were assigned a value of “0.” This means that 
individuals from the same state could have different MLDA exposure, depending on when 
they were age 18-20.
MLDA coding for each state was based on year of change (i.e., when a change occurred, 
MLDA was assigned based on what the MLDA was changing to at any time during that 
year). State of residence at the time of survey administration or death was also used as a 
proxy for state of residence at the age of potential exposure. Since mortality and census 
records do not contain residence history between the ages of 18 and 21, we used state of 
residence at time of observation as a proxy for state of residence during time of exposure. 
While this introduces error due to misclassification, the most likely effect is to reduce the 
estimated magnitude of any true association (i.e., bias toward the null hypothesis, or type II 
error). We have shown elsewhere that migration-induced error is unlikely to bias estimates 
toward type I error unless there is a strong correlation between disease status and change in 
policy exposure upon emigration (Grucza et al., 2012). Furthermore, the rate of 
misclassification is much lower than the rate of emigration since individuals may move to 
states with the same MLDA and thus migrate without changing their policy exposure. 
Elsewhere, using population migration data, we have estimated that misclassification to be 
approximately 11% (Krauss et al., 2015).
 Covariates—Individual-level covariates extracted from mortality records included state 
of residence, year of birth, sex, age, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and year of death. 
Race/ethnicity was coded as non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and other. 
Because of the birth year inclusion criteria, age ranged from 28 to 61 years. Age categories 
corresponded to quartiles; ranges were 28-38, 39-44, 45-50, and 51-61 years old. Education 
was dichotomized such that those with no post-secondary education were coded as “no 
college” and those with one or more years of post-secondary education were classified as 
“any college.” We also included several time-varying state-level covariates to control for 
potential confounding due to factors that might have changed simultaneously with drinking 
age policies and might also influence alcohol-related mortality outcomes. These included a 
measure of citizen political ideology (Berry et al., 1998) state per-capita income, state 
annual unemployment rate, state beer excise tax at time of observation, state beer excise tax 
at time the respondent/decedent was age 21, an indicator for privatization of wine and spirits 
sales, percent of state population affiliated with Judeo-Christian religious denominations, 
and state annual unemployment rate. Per-capita income and unemployment measures were 
obtained from the University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research.(University of 
Kentucky Center for Poverty Research, Gatton College of Business & Economics. 
University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY., n.d.). Data on beer taxes were obtained from the 
Statewide Availability Data System and from the Alcohol Policy Information System 
(National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism., n.d.; Ponicki, 2004). Wine and spirits 
sales privatization data were based on earlier studies examining these policy changes (Hahn 
et al., 2012; Wagenaar and Holder, 1995).
 Stratification Variables—As previously discussed, one limitation of our analytical 
approach is that we do not know the state of residence of each individual during late

 adolescence, and so we approximate MLDA exposure using state of residence at observation 
(i.e., at time of survey or census for the living population and time of death for decedents). 
One way to examine whether this approximation induces bias into our estimates is to 
conduct additional analyses limited to “likely non-movers” (i.e., those who resided in their 
birth state at the time of observation). These individuals are less geographically mobile, and 
therefore more likely to have lived in their current state during the period in which they 
would have been subject to MLDA policies (Plunk et al., 2014b). All analyses conducted on 
the full data set were subsequently conducted on this subset. We also examined whether the 
relationship between MLDA and mortality status differed by educational attainment. As 
discussed earlier, MLDA may have less influence on college campuses, and therefore, 
MLDA-mortality associations may be stronger among those who did not attend college. 
Lower educational attainment is also associated with lower cross-state mobility, so 
migration-related error is also likely lower among this group (Kaestner and Yarnoff, 2011).
Educational attainment was dichotomized as having any education beyond a high-school 
diploma vs. having no post-secondary education. Information on education was missing for 
7.1% of decedents. Therefore, education was multiply imputed from other demographic 
variables for those observations. Five imputations were carried out. These data were used 
only for analyses stratified by education, and reported standard errors reflect the additional 
variance introduced by the imputation process.
 Empirical Strategy
Our objective was to examine whether permissive MLDA exposure (<21) during 
adolescence is associated with increased likelihood of death from the selected alcohol-
related chronic diseases in adulthood. Our quasi-experimental study design is based on the 
difference in differences approach, which models exposure to a policy change by comparing 
pre- and post-policy implementation differences in an outcome for exposed groups to those 
for unexposed comparison groups (Wooldridge, 2010). In effect, we use changes in MLDA 
to reflect within-state variation in alcohol availability over time for individuals under the 
drinking age. This approximates an experimental design if there are no unobserved 
confounders related to both policy exposure and the outcome in question. The plausibility of 
this “exogeneity assumption” rests on whether or not the policy change came about 
independently of other factors that also influence the outcome; for example, MLDA has 
been used as an exogenous variable representing a change in availability by many 
researchers since MLDA changes were driven by national trends (Dee and Evans, 2003).
 Statistical analysis
We used logistic regression to model death due to the chronic diseases listed in Table 1. 
Fixed-effects regression models were used to control for the impact of unobserved, time-
invariant state factors and national secular trends. This is accomplished by including dummy 
variables for state and birth year in regression models (Allison, 2009; Wooldridge, 2010). 
Final models included the primary independent variable (MLDA exposure), as well as state 
and birth-year fixed effects, participant demographics (sex, race, age category, year of 
observation, and education), and state-level variables selected as described previously 
(unemployment rate, per capita income, political ideology, beer excise taxes, wine and

 spirits privatization, and religious affiliation). Parameter estimates and clustered standard 
errors were calculated using the SAS (Version 9.2, SAS Institute, Cary, NC) procedure 
“surveylogistic” employing state as the clustering unit (Angrist and Pischke, 2008; Arellano, 
1987; Bertrand et al., 2004).
 Results
Table 2 describes the demographic characteristics of the sample broken down by mortality 
status for each of the causes of death analyzed. The number of decedents ranged from 8,397 
for laryngeal cancer to 115,841 for alcoholic liver disease. Men were substantially over-
represented among decedents for each outcome, comprising between 70.1 and 80.5% of 
decedents. Blacks were over-represented among deaths from lip/oral/pharynx cancer, 
laryngeal cancer and liver disease not specified as alcoholic, while Whites were over-
represented among esophageal cancer decedents. Hispanics were under-represented among 
all types of cancers, but over-represented among liver disease decedents. The proportion of 
death from each cause was also higher for older individuals and those who resided in their 
state of birth at time of observation.
Results of logistic regression analyses modeling risk for death from each cause as a function 
of permissive MLDA exposure are displayed in Table 3 (full models with estimates for all 
covariates are described in Tables S1-S5). Mortality risk was positive and statistically 
significant for alcoholic liver disease and for other liver disease (i.e., not specified as 
alcoholic); permissive MLDA exposure was associated with 5% and 6% greater odds of 
death from those two causes, respectively (OR = 1.05, 95% CI [1.01, 1.10]; OR = 1.06, 95% 
CI [1.01, 1.12]). A significant association between higher risk of death and permissive 
MLDA was also observed for lip/oral/pharynx cancers (OR = 1.05, 95% CI [1.01, 1.10]). 
The association between MLDA and esophageal and laryngeal cancers did not approach 
statistical significance. Analyses conditioned on sex did not suggest any meaningful 
between-groups differences. These analyses were then repeated for likely non-movers, for 
whom permissive MLDA was significantly associated with 6% greater odds of mortality 
from alcoholic liver disease (OR = 1.06, 95% CI [1.01, 1.11]), but not with other outcomes. 
However, point estimates were largely similar to those observed in the full sample. As with 
the full-sample analyses, there were no notable between-groups differences when likely non-
mover men and women were analyzed separately.
Table 4 describes results from analyses conditioned on educational attainment. Individuals 
who reported any college attendance did not exhibit significant associations between 
permissive MLDA and any of the causes of death we examined (although deaths from 
laryngeal cancers approached nominal significance criteria for likely non-movers who had 
gone to college). However, individuals who reported not attending college exhibited 
significant associations between permissive MLDA and several causes of death in the full 
sample: 6% higher odds for death from alcoholic liver disease, 8% higher odds for other 
liver disease, and 7% higher odds for lip/oral/pharynx cancers (OR = 1.06, 95% CI [1.02, 
1.10]; OR = 1.08, 95% CI [1.03, 1.13]; OR = 1.07, 95% CI [1.03, 1.12]). Estimates based on 
the likely non-mover subsample did not differ significantly from those derived from the full 
sample.

  Discussion
Our findings suggest that individuals who were legally permitted to purchase alcohol prior to 
age 21 had modest, but statistically significant, increased risk of death from alcoholic liver 
disease, other liver disease, and lip/oral/pharyngeal cancers relative to those who were not 
permitted to purchase alcohol until age 21. These apparent policy effects were driven by 
individuals without any college education—those who reported having attended college did 
not exhibit increased mortality risk related to permissive MLDA exposure.
These findings are consistent with earlier studies from our group suggesting that permissive 
MLDA exposure during adolescence and young adulthood is related to increased risk of 
alcohol misuse later in life (Norberg et al., 2009; Plunk et al., 2013). The finding that MLDA 
only seems to have impacted alcohol-related mortality for non-college educated individuals 
is also consistent with our past work. It may be that the 21 drinking age confers protection 
against heavy drinking among non-college educated individuals, but not among those who 
attended college (Grucza et al., 2009). If life-long drinking habits are formed during these 
years, MLDA-related differences may extend into adulthood (Plunk et al., 2013).
The idea that college attendance could be associated with decreases in the effectiveness of 
the MLDA is also consistent with other research. For example, binge drinking has decreased 
in the general population, but is more common on college campuses, where the campus 
environment likely insulates against policies aimed at curbing underage drinking due to easy 
access to alcohol coupled with a culture that promotes drinking to excess (Grucza et al., 
2009; Johnston et al., 2015). Other researchers have noted that underage college students 
report being able to obtain alcohol very easily and that legal-age drinkers are their primary 
source (Wagenaar et al., 1996; Wechsler et al., 2002). Further, most legal-aged college 
students also report frequently providing alcohol to underage peers (Brown et al., 2009). Our 
current findings are consistent with this proposed campus insulation effect: the MLDA 
seems to be less effective on college campuses, where underage drinkers have ready access 
to alcohol.
It is also possible that the positive impact of college education on health could be 
moderating the negative effects of permissive MLDA exposure on the outcomes we 
examined. However, regardless of the exact mechanism involved, our findings suggest that 
the long-term impact of lowering the drinking age as a response to risky college drinking 
would primarily be experienced by those without a college education.
Based on current death rates, and assuming that the effects documented above are 
generalizable to the current population, we estimate that the 21 drinking is preventing 900 
deaths per year from alcoholic liver disease, 1,000 deaths per year from liver disease not 
specified as alcoholic, and 400 deaths annually from lip/oral/pharynx cancers. These effects 
were observed only among individuals who never attended college. Based on U.S. Census 
Bureau estimates, as of 2014 there were approximately 62 million adults age 25 and over in 
the U.S. without any form of post-secondary education (roughly 30% of the adult 
population). Further, while heavy drinking has declined across the population, there are still 
important between groups differences based on college attendance. According to Monitoring 
Plunk et al.

 the Future data, college student heavy drinking (5+ drinks in a row sometime in the prior 
two weeks) has declined nine percentage points (from 44% to 35%) from 1980 to 2014. 
Heavy drinking declined by 12 percentage points (from 41% to 29%) during the same period 
for non-college respondents (Johnston et al., 2015). These differences suggest that 
adolescents and young adults who do not attend college likely continue to benefit from the 
21 MLDA.
 Limitations and conclusion
We make several assumptions which could bias our results if violated and thus represent 
potential limitations of our study. First, we assume that MLDA did not change because of 
unobserved confounding factors that varied by state, but rather came about due to national 
trends. This assumption is supported by past research suggesting that MLDA laws are 
suitable exogenous predictors of alcohol use (Dee and Evans, 2003). We also assume that 
any error introduced by retrospectively estimating policy exposure was essentially random. 
While we do introduce error by estimating exposure, bias toward false positive associations 
would require that other factors related to increased risk of death from the outcomes we 
examined were correlated with the with the decision to move to states with permissive 
MLDAs. Our conditional analyses for likely non-mover and individuals who did not attend 
college, two sub-groups less likely to migrate between states, suggest that this is not the 
case. To the degree that our assumptions are reasonable, our results represent the average 
effect of MLDA exposure in addition to these other unmeasured factors.
Even in light of these limitations, our findings suggest that the long-term effects of 
permissive MLDAs—which represent increased access to alcohol at an earlier age—extend 
to alcohol-related chronic disease. We also offer additional evidence that increases in the 
MLDA significantly protected individuals who did not attend college, which would need to 
be addressed by those who argue that lower drinking ages are justified because of the 
prevalence of heavy drinking on college campuses. These analyses have focused only on 
diseases with a high degree of alcohol-attributable mortality. The 21 drinking age likely 
protects against other chronic diseases as well, and thus represents a major protective factor 
against alcohol-related morbidity and mortality in the United States.
