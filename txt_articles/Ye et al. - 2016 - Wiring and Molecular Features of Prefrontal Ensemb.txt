SUMMARY
A major challenge in understanding the cellular diver-
sity of the brain has been linking activity during
behavior
with
standard
cellular
typology.
For
example, it has not been possible to determine
whether principal neurons in prefrontal cortex active
during distinct experiences represent separable cell
types, and it is not known whether these differentially
active cells exert distinct causal influences on
behavior. Here, we develop quantitative hydrogel-
based technologies to connect activity in cells report-
ing on behavioral experience with measures for both
brain-wide wiring and molecular phenotype. We find
that positive and negative-valence experiences in
prefrontal cortex are represented by cell populations
that differ in their causal impact on behavior, long-
range wiring, and gene expression profiles, with the
major discriminant being expression of the adapta-
tion-linked gene NPAS4. These findings illuminate
cellular logic of prefrontal cortex information pro-
cessing and natural adaptive behavior and may point
the way to cell-type-specific understanding and
treatment of disease-associated states.
INTRODUCTION
The many regions and layers of the mammalian prefrontal cortex
are known to contain cells with a rich diversity of activity pat-
terns. Indeed, otherwise-indistinguishable populations of prin-
cipal cells exhibiting profoundly distinct changes in activity in
response to stimulus have been characterized by electrophysio-
logical recording and cellular-resolution fluorescence Ca2+ im-
aging (Hayden et al., 2008; Insel and Barnes, 2015; Ito et al.,
2003; Matsumoto et al., 2007; Pinto and Dan, 2015; Warden
et al., 2012). At the same time, datastreams of anatomical and
molecular information on prefrontal cell typology have emerged
from a variety of methods, also pointing toward a rich diversity of
principal neurons despite the traditional view that these cells
were more homogenous than the highly diverse and readily
separable interneurons (Hof et al., 1996; Lee et al., 2014; Solo-
way et al., 2002). These findings have highlighted the morpho-
logical, wiring, and electrophysiological diversity of principal
neurons even within individual layers and subregions.
However, the mapping and correspondences (if any) among
these different domains of diversity (activity during behavior,
long-range wiring, and molecular phenotype) have remained
largely unclear within prefrontal cortex. Addressing this issue
would have fundamental implications for elucidating the cellular
logic of prefrontal cortex function; moreover, differences in wir-
ing, role in behavior, and molecular signatures among differen-
tially responsive cells could provide long-elusive insight into
the mechanisms of action of current neuromodulation therapies
and even lay the foundation for developing new kinds of cell-tar-
geted disease treatment. But the unique and non-stereotyped
nature of each mammalian nervous system has prevented exper-
imental resolution of this fundamental question, since cellular-
resolution activity in a brain during behavior would have to be
directly linked to quantitative local and global wiring, as well as
to molecular analysis of the very same cells in the same mamma-
lian brain, which has not yet been possible. Here, we address this
question by developing approaches to quantify long-range anat-
omy, molecular signatures, and the causal impact of prefrontal
cortical cells, defined by activity during distinct experiences.
RESULTS
Behavioral Cohort-Scale Whole-Brain Activity Mapping
We began with development and integration of enhanced Arc-
TRAP and CLARITY technologies. The ArcTRAP transgenic

 mouse line was previously shown to translate temporally de-
limited neuronal activity into fluorescence via CreER/tamox-
ifen-mediated recombination (Figure 1A) (Guenthner et al.,
2013). While the ArcTRAP line had been reported to have
high background recombination, we developed an aqueous
formulation of the fast-acting tamoxifen (4-hydroxytamoxifen,
4TM) enabling dosage reduction by an order of magnitude;
this approach to ArcTRAP was found to eliminate the back-
ground recombination (Figures 1B and S1B). ArcTRAP mice
can then be exposed to a rewarding or aversive experience
(e.g., cocaine dosing at 15 mg/kg or a series of 0.5 mA/2 s
foot shocks, respectively) with resulting robust and faithful
labeling of neurons (Figure S1A); for example, histology con-
firmed that both experience types (with comparable but
opposite conditioning value; Figures S1C and S1D) recruited
neurons in basolateral amygdala (BLA; which is known to be
involved in both reward and aversion processing) (Hsiang
et al., 2014) (Figure 1B).
This approach brings untapped potential for obtaining deeper
perspective on the cells activated, including insight into brain-
wide patterns and molecular properties of cells recruited. Tradi-
tional thin-section histology would be prohibitively labor-inten-
sive for whole-brain analysis in large behavioral-scale cohorts
and also subject to sampling loss and bias, but the recent emer-
gence of tissue transparency techniques, such as CLARITY, has,
in principle, enabled lossless high-resolution brain-wide imaging
compatible with molecular analysis (Chung et al., 2013; Tomer
et al., 2014), if not yet in large cohorts of subjects. We therefore
developed an enhanced CLARITY process suitable for this chal-
lenge of large-cohort analysis linked to behavioral experience;

 key capabilities achieved included much faster speed and lower
cost, as well as automated analysis algorithms adapted to both
TRAP labeling and widely available commercial light-sheet mi-
croscope hardware (Figures 1A, 1C, 1D, and S1E–S1H; see the
Experimental Procedures).
Employing this integrated TRAP/CLARITY approach, multiple
cohorts (with temporally delimited exposure to appetitive
cocaine dosing, aversive foot shock, or neither experience; n =
5 mice per group) were processed using two-color imaging on
the light-sheet microscope. Image volumes taken in the green
(autofluorescence) channel were iteratively co-registered, using
an intensity-based non-linear registration algorithm, to generate
an average reference brain. The registration based on the green
channel from each brain was then used to warp the red channel
(consisting of the TRAP signal) for each brain into this reference
space (Figure S1I).
We first manually delineated potentially relevant regions in the
reference brain, including mPFC, NAc (nucleus accumbens),
BLA, BNST (bed nucleus of the stria terminalis), LH (lateral hy-
pothalamus), PVN (paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus),
and CeA (central nucleus of the amygdala). At this level of
inspection, the singly defined regional levels of neuronal activa-
tionwerefoundto be largelysimilarbetweenthetwo verydifferent
kinds of experience (Figures 2A–2D and S2H–S2J; Table S1),
highlighting the need for a more refined analysis. To search

 conditions despite this apparent similarity, we manually regis-
tered the Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) (Oh et al., 2014) to the CLARITY
reference. Locations of experience-recruited cells were also
mapped into the reference, so that the number of recruited cells
in every brain region could be quantified in an unbiased fashion
(Menegas et al., 2015); changes in TRAP cell numbers (relative
to home cage-animal mean values) in �200 brain regions were
then automatically quantified (Figures S2A–S2G).
Individual single-region activation patterns consistent across
subjects within a group largely agreed with the manual analysis.
For example, robust increases in TRAPped cells were observed
in both settings within mPFC, NAc, BLA, pallidal regions (con-
taining BNST), and hypothalamus (Figure S2K). However, the
change in active cell count across all regions revealed common
multi-region correlation patterns in mice from the same experi-
mental group, suggesting experience-specific brain-wide pat-
terns (Figure 2E). To investigate these differences, we applied
principal component analysis (PCA) to the matrix of activated
cell-count changes in cocaine- or shock-labeled mice. The first
two principal components (PCs) comprised >75% of the vari-
ance for the dataset (Figure S2L) and thus were examined
more closely. Plotting the position of each mouse in the space
defined by the first two PCs revealed a clear separation between
the behavioral conditions (Figure 2F).
To better understand the source of this separation, we exam-
ined the PC loadings across all of the included brain areas (Fig-
ure 2G). The first PC was found to reflect more general differ-
ences in activated cell recruitment across all regions (e.g.,
higher mean change across all regions in shock versus control
mice; p < 0.05, t test). The second PC, by contrast, revealed a
specific correlated group of DORpm (polymodal association cor-
tex-related dorsal thalamus) regions, containing the lateral habe-
nula (LHb), a key nucleus for aversive behaviors (Li et al., 2011,
2013). These regions were more strongly recruited by shock
than by cocaine, revealing a selective responsiveness to the
aversive experience. Consistently, manual quantification also
found that shock more than cocaine, activated the LHb (p <
0.01 for shock versus home-cage experience; p < 0.05 for shock
versus cocaine experience; Figure 2H). Thus, this behavioral
cohort-scale TRAP/CLARITY labeling revealed brain-wide pat-
terns of neuronal activation, as well as quantitative region-spe-
cific activation differences at the cellular level between different
experimental conditions.
Resolving mPFC Populations and Projections Activated
by Appetitive or Aversive Experience
Similarity in activation pattern by appetitive and aversive expe-
riences has been reported in individually selected brain regions
(verified broadly, though not in all regions, by the brain-wide
analysis here) (Johnson et al., 2010; Xiu et al., 2014). A falsifi-
able hypothesis would be that the same neuron-type distribu-
tion was recruited by the two stimuli. In mPFC, the existing liter-
ature does not support or falsify this hypothesis, though mPFC
is associated with specific reward and aversion processes
(including cocaine-conditioned place preference, (Tzschentke
and Schmidt, 1998, 1999), fear and anxiety behaviors (Bur-
gos-Robles et al., 2009; Lammel et al., 2011; Shah et al.,
2004; Shah and Treit, 2003), and more general functions poten-
tially relevant to the single-population hypothesis (including
attention, salience- and novelty-detection, and working mem-
ory) (Dalley et al., 2004; Miller, 2000). The region-specific
brain-wide analysis here may open the door to testing a distinct
hypothesis—that appetitive and aversive experience recruit
distinct neuron-type populations. Axonal projection anatomy
is one of the most important features that might resolve prin-
cipal cell population types involved in such distinct processes
(Jennings et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2013; Lammel et al., 2012;
Namburi et al., 2015), but this feature has been difficult to
explore in a brain-wide fashion, while remaining linked (at the
cellular level) to function during behavior.
A very strongly expressed activity-dependent cell-filling label
(unlike traditional nuclear c-fos immunostaining or transiently
or transgenically expressed fluorophores) in principle might
allow for acquisition of this crucial wiring information as well
from the same experimental subjects, provided that axon tracts
of labeled neurons could be robustly imaged and quantified in
this context. We therefore developed a CLARITY-optimized
axonal-filling fluorescent protein, engineered, in part, by insert-
ing the 30 UTR of neuritin (NRN) RNA (Akten et al., 2011) at the
C terminus of EYFP (Figures S3A and S3B). We found that this
construct could be packaged into high-titer adeno-associated
virus (AAV) capsids that indeed enabled focal injection-defined
projection labeling in CLARITY; for example, efferent mPFC pro-
jections could be readily followed throughout the entire adult
mouse brain after a single stereotaxic injection (Figures 3A and
3B). Visualizing axonal tracks in 3D revealed key topographical
features that were difficult, if not impossible, to detect in thin
2D sections (Figures 3A and S3C); for example, a prominent
axon bundle traveling from mPFC to ventral medial thalamus
was observed to carry out a sharp U turn near the VTA (Figures
3C and 3D), a potentially important feature that has not been
described in existing atlases (Figure S3D).
Quantifying these tracts was also an unresolved challenge,
and we therefore developed a method to compute 3D structure
tensors from CLARITY images for tractography (Figures S3E–
S3H). Faithful reconstruction of calculated streamlines was
achieved (using tools adapted from diffusion tractography; Sup-
plemental Experimental Procedures); these streamlines mapped
onto fibers from CLARITY images (Figures 3E and 3F), and
importantly, the streamline count in each bundle tightly corre-
lated with the ground-truth physical diameter of the axonal
bundles (Figure S3I). Using this method, we reconstructed
whole-brain projections based on CLARITY images (Figure 3G);
connectivity between a seed region (defined by stereotaxic injec-
tion site) and any specified target could be readily visualized and
assessed by counting streamlines (Figures 3H and S3J–S3M).
To integrate this capability, with the needed additional capa-
bility of projection-labeling in cells defined by their use during
experience, we sought to develop a viral CreER/4TM strategy

 cassette under this promoter (Kawashima et al., 2013; Li et al.,
1998; Matsuda and Cepko, 2007); when injected into a reporter
mouse, this viral CreER/4TM system reliably enabled activity-
and tamoxifen-dependent cell-body and projection labeling
(Figures S4E and S4F).
A final essential feature for quantitative activity-dependent
projection mapping was normalization on an individual level to
the absolute tract labeling strength independent of activity; this
normalization is crucial in a virus-based approach to control for
variation in injection efficacy. We enabled this feature (Figure 4A)
by building in simultaneous two-color activity-independent
(structural, EYFP) labeling and activity-dependent (tdTomato)
labeling of projections from the same injection site, in which
these two viruses infected cells with a stable relative ratio across

 animals (Figures S4G and S4H). Dual-color quantification of pro-
jections to multiple downstream regions is then achieved by
counting the number of streamlines ending in these regions,
and the activity-dependence is corrected for anatomical and in-
jection variability from the red/green streamline ratio at the indi-
vidual animal level. This quantification of projection use across
the brain from behaviorally defined neuronal populations is (for
brevity) termed here CLARITY-based activity projection tracking
upon recombination, or CAPTURE (Figure 4A).
Distinct Projection Patterns among Behavioral
Experience-Defined mPFC Populations
We applied CAPTURE to quantify projections from cocaine- and
shock-recruited mPFC populations. Ai14 reporter mice were co-
injected with CaMKIIa-EYFP-NRN and cFos-ER-Cre-ER-PEST
AAVs and subjected to 4TM-mediated cocaine and shock label-
ing. With CAPTURE, projections from all CaMKIIa (principally
excitatory glutamatergic) neurons are labeled with EYFP and
projections from behaviorally recruited populations are labeled
with tdTomato. Importantly, EYFP fibers in the NAc, BLA, and
VTA were found to be indistinguishable between the cocaine-
and shock-labeled animals, indicating minimal variation in viral
injection, transduction, and expression between the two groups
(Figure 4B).
In the very same animals, significantly more projections from
behaviorally activated mPFC neurons were observed targeting
the NAc in cocaine-exposed animals compared to shock-
exposed animals. Conversely, we observed significantly more
behaviorally activated mPFC fibers to the LHb in shock-exposed
animals (Figures 4C–4F). No significant difference in red/green
(activity/structure) ratio was observed between the two groups
in the VTA, showing no detectable systematic difference in
efficiency or targeting of viral labeling. The cocaine-activated
mPFC population thus preferentially projects to the NAc,
whereas the shock-activated population projects more strongly
to LHb, revealing that the neurons recruited in mPFC by distinct-
valence experience are not simply different in terms of the pat-
terns of input that they happen to receive, but represent anatom-
ically distinct cell populations in terms of projection pattern
across the brain.
Molecular Signature of Experience-Defined mPFC
Neurons: Pre-existing NPAS4 Population
Next, we sought to identify molecular distinctions among
cocaine- and shock-responsive populations in mPFC. We began
by crossing ArcCreER mice to a Cre-dependent ribosome-tagged
mouse (Long et al., 2014) to allow for labeling the ribosomes from
neuronal populations activated by well-defined stimuli (Fig-
ure 5A). With this approach, the tagged ribosome can be immu-
noprecipitated (IP) from tissue lysate using an anti-GFP anti-
body, isolating translating mRNA for analysis (Ekstrand et al.,
2014; Heiman et al., 2008; Sanz et al., 2009). These mice were
exposed to either cocaine or shocks with 4TM. After labeling,
mice were returned to the home cage for 2 weeks before initia-
tion of ribosome purification, a design focused on identifying
intrinsic signatures of these populations rather than on immedi-
ate mRNA expression changes associated with the exposure
to stimuli.
Equal enrichment of GFP transcripts under these conditions
was first confirmed by qPCR (Figure S5A). Four groups of
mRNA (‘‘IP fraction’’ for ribosome-associated transcripts from
cocaine and shock and ‘‘input’’ for whole-tissue lysate from
cocaine and shock; see the Experimental Procedures) were
then analyzed by microarray. For both stimuli, IP fraction
groups were enriched 3-fold in the ribosomal-component
mRNA (Rpl10a) compared with input groups (Figures 5C and
5D), further demonstrating similar levels of mRNA enrichment
between treatments. Gene expression profiles from cells re-
cruited under the two conditions were highly similar upon initial
examination
(<10
genes

>2-fold
difference;
Fig-
ure S5C); however, a transcript of the activity-dependent tran-
scription factor Npas4 (Bloodgood et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2008;
Shamloo et al., 2006) was uniquely enriched in cocaine-acti-
vated cells compared to shock-activated cells (Figure 5B).
This enrichment was confirmed by comparing the IP fraction
to the input from the cocaine-labeled cells (Figure 5C) and
finally validated by qPCR (Figure 5E); in contrast, this enrich-
ment was not observed by comparing the IP and input fractions
from the shock-labeled population (Figure 5D).
Because Npas4 itself is an immediate early gene that can be
transiently induced by neuronal activity, we first tested if its
enrichment in the cocaine-recruited population could relate to
a lasting general cocaine-elevated Npas4 transcription. Both
cocaine and shock caused a rapid increase of Npas4 expression
in mPFC within 30 min, as expected; however, this induction un-
der both conditions, (also as expected) completely returned to
baseline after 10 days before the ribosome was profiled (Fig-
ure S5B). Indeed, no difference was observed when we exam-
ined Npas4 expression in whole-tissue lysates from cocaine-
and shock-labeled mPFC (Figure 5E), indicating that exposure
to cocaine did not lead to an overall long-term increase of
Npas4 expression in mPFC.
At the single-cell level, we discovered that the number of
mPFC cells with NPAS4 immunoreactivity did not differ between
behavioral groups or between the home-cage and behavior-
challenged animals (Figures 5F–5H). However, TRAP/NPAS4
double-positive cell counts were significantly higher in cocaine-
exposed mice (Figure 5I), consistent with activity recruitment of
an NPAS4 population. Similarly, the percentage of NPAS4+ cells
among TRAP+ cells was also significantly higher in cocaine-
labeled mPFC than in shock-labeled mPFC (Figure 5J). Impor-
tantly, we found that another positive-valence experience (highly
palatable food consumption), but not another negative-valence
experience (restraint stress), also selectively recruited this
mPFC NPAS4+ population (Figures S5D and S5E), further illus-
trating that a pre-existing NPAS4+ population is preferentially
activated by salient stimuli associated with positive valence
rather than negative valence. Finally, the molecular overlap be-
tween the positive valence-associated population and the
NPAS4+ population led us to further examine the spatial distribu-
tion of valence-specific populations, since the NPAS4+ cells ap-
peared to be enriched in superficial layers of the mPFC (Figures
5F and S5E); indeed, the positive-valence experiences were
associated with a significantly larger fraction of TRAPped layer
2/3 neurons in the mPFC than in the negative-valence experi-
ences (Figure S5F).

 Cocaine- and Shock-Activated Populations Control
Appetitive and Aversive Behaviors
Next, we tested if electrical activity in these behavioral activity-
defined populations had distinct positive or negative condition-
ing valence for the same animals that had experienced the stim-
ulus, assessed by causal impact on behavior during the place
preference task. To maintain robust, low-background, and direct
region-specific control in mPFC, we designed a viral approach
employing channelrhodopsin tagged with EYFP (ChR2-EYFP)
under the control of the AAV-cFos backbone described earlier
(termed fosCh; Figure 4A). Animals injected with this virus (in
mPFC) were exposed to daily cocaine dosing or shock over 5

 consecutive days, after which time robust increases in the num-
ber of fosCh-labeled cells and in EYFP expression were
observed (Figure 6A–6C).
We first quantified Npas4 expression in fosCh cells, hypothe-
sizing that cocaine-labeled fosCh cells would exhibit higher
Npas4 expression compared with shock-labeled fosCh cells.
This was indeed the case (Figure 6D); importantly, expression
of general excitatory or inhibitory neuronal markers did not differ
between those two populations (Figures S6A and S6B). Consis-
tent with CAPTURE findings, cocaine-labeled fosCh cells were
found to project strongly to NAc, while the LHb contained signif-
icantly denser fibers arising from the shock-labeled cells (Figures
6E–6G). Crucially, this method of targeting was sufficient to
enable optical control over the resulting sparsely distributed
neuronal subsets; fosCh-labeled cells displayed robust light-
evoked firing assessed by in vivo electrophysiological recording
(Figures 7A and 7B). Together, these data demonstrated resolu-
tion with the fosCh strategy of the same pattern that had been
characterized molecularly and anatomically and enabled the
final test of whether these neuronal subsets were capable of
differentially controlling behavior.
To address this question, we employed the real-time place
preference paradigm in which 10 Hz light-pulse trains were
automatically triggered on entry into one side of a behavioral
chamber. Place preference was monitored over three consecu-
tive trials: before, during, and after light delivery for reactivation
of fosCh-defined neuronal ensembles (Figure 7C). To control
for the possibility that behavior could be biased by randomly
labeled neurons, an additional group of animals was included
in which comparable expression of ChR2 was driven by the
CaMKIIa promoter without link to prior activity (Figures S7A
and S7B). Optogenetic stimulation of these non-activity-specific
neuronal populations did not influence place preference, nor
were homecage-recruited fosCh-population animals observed

 to exhibit preference or aversion for the chamber in which the
cells were optically activated. Remarkably, however, reactiva-
tion of the shock- or cocaine-defined fosCh populations induced
significant (and opposite-direction) shifts in place preference,
with cocaine-exposed mice demonstrating preference, and
shock-exposed mice demonstrating aversion, for the photosti-
mulation-paired side (Figures 7D and 7E; mean preference
change at post-test for cocaine: 1.3x ± 0.1, Wilcoxon p =
0.0006; for shock: 0.8x ± 0.1, Wilcoxon p = 0.002). These data
reveal that the activity-defined mPFC neural populations differ
not only anatomically and molecularly but also in functional
impact in modulating behavior.
DISCUSSION
It has been remarked (building on Dobzhansky’s comment that
‘‘nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution’’
(Dobzhansky, 1973) that ‘‘nothing in neurobiology makes sense
except in the light of behavior’’ (Shepherd, 1988). This perspec-
tive may be directly relevant to efforts in multiple subfields of
neuroscience to describe the cellular diversity in nervous sys-
tems. While these efforts are pioneering and informative, it may
be limiting to collect cellular typology datastreams relating to
anatomy, genetics, and membrane biophysics, without knowl-
edge of the importance of activity patterns in those same cells
during behavior. However, forging such direct linkages has
been difficult, especially in vertebrates. Indeed no system may
be more challenging in this regard than the mammalian mPFC,
which does not have well-defined direct sensory input or motor
output pathways, and wherein principal cells with similar spike
properties and anatomical positioning exhibit divergent or even
opposing responses during behavior. Here, we have addressed
these challenges, focusing on the specific problem of whether
mPFC cells that respond differently to positive or negative

 valence experiences are, in fact, separable cell types as defin-
able by molecular or anatomical measures, as well as by causal
impact on behavior.
We identified not only brain-wide projection patterns sepa-
rating mPFC cells responding to positive- and negative-valence
experience but also a unique and unexpected enrichment of
NPAS4 expression characteristic of mPFC cells responding to
appetitive experience (Figure 4; Movie S1) that was not observed
in cells responding to salient aversive experiences with com-
parable conditioning value. In illustrating that a pre-existing
NPAS4+ population is preferentially activated by salient stimuli
associated with positive valence rather than with negative
valence, these mPFC results may be contrasted with elegant
memory-engram models in which cells expressing a key activity
marker may be recruited into diverse stimulus representations,
as with CREB-expressing cells in amygdala fear conditioning
(Han et al., 2007). NPAS4 has been linked to cellular and micro-
circuit processes relating to the balance of excitation and inhibi-
tion, including a form of adaptive plasticity in which inhibitory
synapses are formed on cells in response to high levels of exci-
tation (Bloodgood et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2008; Maya-Vetencourt
et al., 2012; Spiegel et al., 2014). This previously known role of
NPAS4, together with the observation here that the positive-
valence, but not negative-valence, experience recruited the
mPFC NPAS4 population may bear relevance to previous obser-
vations among behaviorists that appetitive-learning experiences
may be more vulnerable to adaptation or extinction, whether with
natural stimuli or in pathological situations seen in drug depen-
dence (Bouton, 2004).
The
CAPTURE
approach
(the
integration
of
enhanced
CLARITY for behavioral cohort-scale work with cell and projec-
tion quantification linked to activity during behavior) is provided
here in the form of tools, software, and datasets that may be
readily applied across systems. The intact-brain approach is
not only scalable in a practical manner to include large cohorts
of experimental subjects and enabling of quantitative projection
and population analysis but also helps address key confounds
relating to selection bias and loss of continuity in traditional
sectioning approaches widely used across neuroscience and
biology. Moreover, improved 3D understanding of the path of
behaviorally relevant axon bundles through the intact brain
may be critical for the expanding field of neuromodulation, which
is increasingly dependent on accurate targeting of white matter
tracts (Henderson, 2012).
These tools are also readily adaptable for broader applica-
tions. For example, the NRN construct allowing rapid axonal
projection labeling may be useful along with recombinase- or
tetracycline-controlled (Liu et al., 2012) promoters for driving
axon-filling fluorophores in approaches to multiplexed cell-
type-specific CLARITY projection mapping or for driving opsins
(Gore et al., 2015) to enhance functional assays of long-range
projections (for example, to test synaptic release at different
points along an axonal projection in slice assays or to test behav-
ioral significance of cells defined by projection target). The fos-
CreER virus (Figure 4) might be used in conjunction with future
generations of high-potency opsin expression systems to enable
optogenetic control based on experience temporally defined
with 4TM, in strategies that could be eventually developed to
reduce the number of repeated exposures currently required
for sustained expression using the fosCh construct (Figure 7C).
Lastly, recombinase-dependent constructs expressing Ca2+ in-
dicators (such as G/RCaMPs) may be used to resolve temporal
dynamics and individual-neuron activity magnitudes within
experience-defined cells; these features are not accessible by
conventional binary IEG-based methods but may be important,
for example, in positive versus negative reinforcement in the
PFC (Pi et al., 2013; Pinto and Dan, 2015).
In future work, it will be important to build on these results with
additional investigation of the mPFC populations. For example,
exploring long-term changes in gene expression and structural
properties in these assemblies after experience (continuing to
leverage the activity-tagging and intact-brain methods) may
help to identify cell-population-resolved processes important in
plasticity of adaptive or maladaptive circuit dynamics. And iden-
tification of these separable mPFC populations, along with anal-
ysis of their interactions and modulations during adaptive and
pathological conditions (in the setting of rapid parallel advances
in high-content molecular phenotyping, targeted drug screening
and design, and genome editing) may point the way toward cell-
population-targeted interventions in diseases of addiction, anx-
iety, and fear.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
Male and female C57BL/6J mice were group-housed on a reverse 12-hr light/
dark cycle. Mice were 6–8 weeks old at viral infusion. Ai14 and wild-type
C57BL/6 mice were purchased from JAX. Rosa26loxp-stop-loxp-eGFP-L10
mice were from Dr. Evan Rosen at Harvard Medical School. Male mice were
used in behavioral assays. Both male and female mice were used for anatomy
assays. All experimental protocols were approved by the Stanford University
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were in accordance with
the guidelines from the NIH.
CAPTURE Labeling
Ai14 mice were injected with a 1-ml mixture of AAV8-CaMKIIa-EYFP-NRN and
AAV8-cFos-ER-Cre-ER-PEST in the mPFC. 2 weeks later, the mice were given
15 mg/kg cocaine (IP) or 20 random foot shocks (2 s/0.5 mA, two shocks/min-
ute on average) for 2 consecutive days. The control group remained in their
home cage for the whole period. 10 mg/kg 4-TM was given to all mice 3 hr after
the last behavior section to enable CreER-mediated recombination. The mice
were returned to their home cages for an additional 4 weeks to allow the full
expression of fluorophores.
CLARITY and Whole-Brain Imaging
Three key features of the new CLARITY platform were (1) accelerated clarifica-
tion through parallelized flow-assisted clearing crucial for large cohorts and in-
dependent of specialized equipment, such as electrophoresis or perfusion
chambers, (2) >90% cost reduction using a new refractive index-matching
process, and (3) optical properties such that the whole mouse brain can be
imaged using a commercial light-sheet microscope (Lavision) under a single
field of view and as a single stack in less than 2 hr with single-cell resolution
(this speed and simplicity is also useful for large behavioral cohorts). The
COLM system (described earlier in Tomer et al., 2014; Lerner et al., 2015) is
optimized for high-resolution imaging and is most useful for studies requiring
sub-cellular information, while the approach outlined here is optimized for
speed and practicality in cellular resolution work, most useful for robust appli-
cation to large cohorts in CLARITY (see the Supplemental Experimental Proce-
dures). All custom software, including the scripts used for atlas building, regis-
tration, and analysis, as well as code for CLARITY-based tractography, are
