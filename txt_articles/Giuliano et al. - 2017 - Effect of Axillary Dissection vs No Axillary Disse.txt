 IMPORTANCE—The results of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 
(ACOSOG Z0011) trial were first reported in 2005 with a median follow-up of 6.3 years. Longer 
follow-up was necessary because the majority of the patients had estrogen receptor–positive 
tumors that may recur later in the disease course (the ACOSOG is now part of the Alliance for 
Clinical Trials in Oncology).
OBJECTIVE—To determine whether the 10-year overall survival of patients with sentinel lymph 
node metastases treated with breast-conserving therapy and sentinel lymph node dissection 
(SLND) alone without axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is noninferior to that of women 
treated with axillary dissection.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—The ACOSOG Z0011 phase 3 randomized 
clinical trial enrolled patients from May 1999 to December 2004 at 115 sites (both academic and 
community medical centers). The last date of follow-up was September 29, 2015, in the ACOSOG 
Z0011 (Alliance) trial. Eligible patients were women with clinical T1 or T2 invasive breast cancer, 
no palpable axillary adenopathy, and 1 or 2 sentinel lymph nodes containing metastases.
INTERVENTIONS—All patients had planned lumpectomy, planned tangential whole-breast 
irradiation, and adjuvant systemic therapy. Third-field radiation was prohibited.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—The primary outcome was overall survival with a 
noninferiority hazard ratio (HR) margin of 1.3. The secondary outcome was disease-free survival.
RESULTS—Among 891 women who were randomized (median age, 55 years), 856 (96%) 
completed the trial (446 in the SLND alone group and 445 in the ALND group). At a median 
follow-up of 9.3 years (interquartile range, 6.93–10.34 years), the 10-year overall survival was 
86.3% in the SLND alone group and 83.6% in the ALND group (HR, 0.85 [1-sided 95%CI, 0–
1.16]; noninferiority P = .02). The 10-year disease-free survival was 80.2% in the SLND alone 
group and 78.2% in the ALND group (HR, 0.85 [95%CI, 0.62–1.17]; P = .32). Between year 5 and 
year 10, 1 regional recurrence was seen in the SLND alone group vs none in the ALND group. 
Ten-year regional recurrence did not differ significantly between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Among women with T1 or T2 invasive primary breast 
cancer, no palpable axillary adenopathy, and 1 or 2 sentinel lymph nodes containing metastases, 
10-year overall survival for patients treated with sentinel lymph node dissection alone was 
noninferior to overall survival for those treated with axillary lymph node dissection. These 
findings do not support routine use of axillary lymph node dissection in this patient population 
based on 10-year outcomes.
TRIAL REGISTRATION—clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00003855
For more than 100 years, the extent of breast cancer surgery was based on the Halstedian 
concept of breast cancer as a locoregional disease that spread via the lymphatic system and 
was cured by resection.1,2 Since then, it has been recognized that breast cancer biology, 
rather than the extent of surgery, is a major risk determinant of both systemic and 
locoregional recurrence,3,4 opening the door to new surgical approaches to management.
Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), long used to identify women with axillary nodal 
metastases, was replaced as a staging procedure by the less morbid sentinel lymph node

 dissection (SLND).5–7 Between 1998 and 2004, the use of ALND declined from 94% to 
36% in women with no axillary nodal metastases, whereas 68% of patients with sentinel 
node metastases underwent ALND in 2004.8 Axillary lymph node dissection is an effective 
method of maintaining regional control but it is associated with a significant risk of 
complications such as lymphedema, numbness, axillary web syndrome, and decreased 
upper-extremity range of motion.6 Changes in the presentation and management of breast 
cancer and the selection of systemic therapy based on tumor biology raised questions 
regarding the necessity of ALND for some patients with sentinel lymph node metastases.
The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 (ACOSOG Z0011) randomized 
clinical trial was designed to determine whether SLND alone yielded survival outcomes that 
were noninferior to that obtained with ALND in women with a limited number of sentinel 
node metastases undergoing breast-conserving surgery and receiving adjuvant whole-breast 
irradiation with adjuvant systemic therapy. The ACOSOG is now part of the Alliance for 
Clinical Trials in Oncology (Alliance). The trial protocol appears in the Supplement.
The initial study results, reported after a median follow-up of 6.3 years,9,10 demonstrated 
that the overall survival in patients randomized to SLND alone was no worse than patients 
randomized to ALND with a noninferiority hazard ratio (HR) margin of 1.3. It also showed 
no statistically significant difference in disease-free survival between patients randomized to 
SLND alone or ALND, and nodal recurrence occurred in fewer than 1% of patients in either 
study group.
A serious criticism of the study was the relatively short follow-up that may have not detected 
late death. Breast cancer, particularly hormone receptor–positive breast cancer, is a disease 
with a long natural history11,12 and a substantial risk of locoregional and systemic relapses 
occurring after 5 years. Patients enrolled in ACOSOG Z0011 reflected the demographics of 
patients with breast cancer in the United States. The majority of patients were 
postmenopausal with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer, raising concern that 
additional follow-up beyond 6 years was needed to document noninferiority of overall 
survival with SLND alone in this node-positive cohort.
Methods
Patient Characteristics
This multicenter randomized phase 3 trial was registered with the National Cancer Institute 
and approved by the institutional review boards at participating centers. All patients 
provided written informed consent. Adult women with histologically confirmed invasive 
breast carcinoma clinically 5 cm or less in size, no palpable adenopathy, and with sentinel 
nodes containing metastatic breast cancer detected without immunohistochemical stains 
were eligible for participation. The eligibility criteria have been reported.9,10
Study and Design End Points
The study and design end points have been described else-where.9,10 Briefly, after 
stratification based on age, hormone receptor status, and tumor size, patients with 1 or 2 
sentinel nodes with metastases detected by hematoxylin and eosin stain were randomized to

 no further axillary-specific treatment including no axillary third-field irradiation (SLND 
alone group) or completion ALND (ALND group). Patients were assessed for disease 
recurrence with a history and physical examination every 6 months for the first 36 months 
and yearly thereafter. Annual mammography was required; other testing was based on 
individual symptoms or by investigator preference.
Follow-up was planned for 10 years. The primary study end point was overall survival, 
which was defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause. Disease-free 
survival, which was defined as the time from randomization to death or first breast cancer 
recurrence, was a secondary end point along with morbidity and locoregional recurrence. 
Locoregional recurrence was defined as a tumor in the breast or in ipsilateral axillary, 
internal mammary, subclavicular, or supraclavicular nodes. All other disease sites were 
defined as distant metastases. Secondary end points have been reported.6,13
Statistical Analysis
The primary end point was overall survival as a measure of noninferiority of no further 
axillary-specified interventions (SLND alone group) compared with the ALND group. The 
study design hypothesized that overall survival would be 80% at 5 years for optimally 
treated women in this node-positive cohort. The SLND alone group would be considered 
clinically noninferior to the ALND group if the 5-year survival rate was 75% or greater and 
the HR was 1.3 or less. A 1-sided 95% CI for the HR from a Cox regression model was used 
to confirm noninferiority of SLND alone compared with ALND. An estimated 500 deaths 
were needed for the study to have 90% power.14
Enrollment of 1900 patients in 4 years with a minimum follow-up period of 5 years was 
initially planned. The trial closed early because of low accrual rates and fewer than 
anticipated events. The protocol specified that patients were to be followed up for a 
minimum of 10 years. However, the analysis of overall survival after the completion of study 
follow-up was not prespecified.
Analyses were performed on the intent-to-treat sample (436 patients in the SLND alone 
group and 420 patients in the ALND group) as well as on the patients who actually received 
treatment. Both analyses yielded similar results so only the intent-to-treat results are 
reported. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for overall survival were compared using the log-
rank test for noninferiority. The unadjusted HR (95% CI) was calculated using a Cox 
regression analysis. Patients who were lost to follow-up (ie, missing data) were censored at 
the time of their last follow-up in the time-to-event analyses (disease-free survival and 
overall survival). Most patients were lost to follow-up because the site investigator left an 
institution and the institution stopped active follow-up on the patients. Hence, the missing 
data were not associated with outcome.
Patients who withdrew consent for use of their information were omitted from the analyses. 
All secondary analyses were tested for differences. As a secondary analysis, known 
prognostic factors (including adjuvant treatment) were included in the Cox regression model 
to generate an adjusted HR for overall survival. Disease-free survival was analyzed with a 
log-rank analysis using Kaplan-Meier curves and unadjusted and multivariable Cox

 regression analyses. The proportional hazards assumptions for the Cox models were 
evaluated using Schoenfeld residual plots, and none of the reported models appeared to 
violate the proportional hazards assumption.
An exploratory analysis was conducted to determine the effect of treatment (SLND alone vs 
ALND) on overall survival for patients with hormone receptor–positive tumors. A 
comparison was done among 4 groups of patients (hormone receptor–positive treated with 
ALND, hormone receptor–positive treated with SLND alone, hormone receptor–negative 
treated with ALND, hormone receptor–negative treated with SLND alone) using a log-rank 
test. In addition, a log-rank test was used to determine whether hormone receptor status was 
associated with overall survival in the ALND group.
Data collection and statistical analyses in the ACOSOG Z0011 (Alliance) trial were 
conducted by the Alliance Statistics and Data Center. Data quality was ensured by review of 
data by the Alliance Statistics and Data Center and by the study chairperson following 
Alliance policies. The study database was frozen on September 29, 2015. Except for the 
primary overall survival analysis, each analysis was performed with a 2-sided, .05 
significance level, and 95% CIs. SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) was used for all 
analyses.
Results
Patient Characteristics
Enrollment began in May 1999 with a planned accrual of 1900 patients and closed in 
December 2004 due to a lower than expected event rate.9 There were 891 patients 
randomized from 115 institutions (both academic and community medical centers); 35 
withdrew consent (Figure 1). Demographic and disease characteristics at baseline were well 
balanced between the SLND alone group and the ALND group (Table 1).9
Treatment Results
Fewer lymph nodes were removed in the SLND alone group (median, 2; interquartile range 
[IQR], 1–4) than in the ALND group (median, 17; IQR, 13–22) (P < .001), and the total 
number of involved nodes was greater in the ALND group. The median total number of 
nodes containing metastases in both groups was 1 (IQR, 1–2).
Micrometastases (≤2 mm) were identified in the sentinel nodes of 164 patients (44.8%) in 
the SLND alone group compared with 137 patients (37.5%) in the ALND group (P = .046). 
In addition, 27.3% of patients in the ALND group had macrometastases (>2 mm) in 
nonsentinel nodes removed during ALND, including 10% of patients with micrometastases 
in a sentinel node.
Adjuvant systemic therapy was delivered to 423 women (97.0%) in the SLND alone group 
and 403 women (96.0%) in the ALND group, with no between-group difference in the type 
of chemotherapy or the proportion receiving endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, or both. The 
majority of women received radiation therapy (277 women [89.6%] in the SLND alone 
group vs 263 women [88.9%] in the ALND group). An independent analysis of radiation

 fields in a subset of participants demonstrated no between-group difference in the use of 
high tangents, nodal irradiation, or no irradiation; 18.9% received protocol-prohibited nodal-
field irradiation.15 Eleven percent received no irradiation.
Overall Survival
At a median follow-up of 9.3 years (IQR, 6.93–10.34 years), there were 110 deaths (51 in 
the SLND alone group and 59 in the ALND group). Compared with ALND, SLND alone 
was found to be noninferior for overall survival (log-rank P = .02; Figure 2A). The 10-year 
overall survival rate was 86.3% (95% CI, 82.2%–89.5%) in the SLND alone group and 
83.6% (95% CI, 79.1%–87.1%) in the ALND group. The unadjusted HR comparing overall 
survival between the SLND alone group and the ALND group was 0.85 (1-sided 95% CI, 0–
1.16), which did not cross the prespecified noninferiority HR margin of 1.3. The HR for 
overall survival adjusting for adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, radiation, 
or a combination of these 3) and age for the SLND alone group compared with the ALND 
group was 0.93 (1-sided 95% CI, 0–1.28) (Table 2).
In a multivariable analysis of overall survival, type of treatment was not significantly 
associated with overall survival (Table 3). An exploratory analysis of the effect of treatment 
and hormone receptor status revealed no statistically significant difference in overall survival 
among the 4 groups (log-rank P = .14; Figure 2B). Operation had no significant effect on 
overall survival with respect to estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status.
Disease-Free Survival
Disease-free survival and locoregional recurrence have been reported.13 The 10-year 
disease-free survival was 80.2%(95% CI, 75.6%–84.1%) for the SLND alone group and 
78.2% (95% CI, 73.5%–82.2%) for the ALND group (log-rank P = .32; Figure 2C). The 
unadjusted HR comparing the SLND alone group with the ALND group was 0.85 (95% CI, 
0.62–1.17) (Table 2). Only 1 nodal recurrence was observed in a patient in the SLND alone 
group after 5 years and none in the ALND group. In an unplanned analysis of the subset of 
the 228 patients with detailed radiation records available, those treated with nodal-field 
irradiation experienced no difference in disease-free survival, overall survival, or 
locoregional recurrence compared with those who did not receive irradiation.
Discussion
Even with follow-up extended to a median of 9.3 years, the ACOSOG Z0011 (Alliance) 
randomized clinical trial demonstrated that SLND alone did not result in inferior overall 
survival outcomes compared with ALND for patients with clinical T1 or T2 node-negative 
(by palpation) breast cancer and 1 or 2 positive sentinel nodes treated with breast-conserving 
therapy and adjuvant systemic therapy. Before publication of the initial ACOSOG Z0011 
trial results,9 there was a general consensus that axillary dissection was necessary for better 
cancer control when metastases were identified in sentinel lymph nodes.
Axillary dissections are associated with considerable morbidity, and the results of this trial 
demonstrated that this morbidity can be avoided without decreasing cancer control. The 
long-term outcome of this study provides additional support that axillary dissection is not

 necessary for long-term disease control and survival for patients with positive sentinel 
nodes, even for those with generally late-recurring hormone receptor–positive tumors.
In addition, there was no significant difference in disease-free survival between patients 
treated with SLND alone and ALND. This confirms that although distant recurrence among 
hormone receptor–positive tumors is a later event, nodal recurrence among these patients is 
primarily an early event. The stability of these results over time is important because patients 
with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer, who comprise the majority of study 
participants and the majority of breast cancer patients in the United States, are known to be 
at prolonged risk for disease recurrence.
Although the annual rate of distant recurrence after completion of 5 years of endocrine 
therapy has been reported to range from 0.9% to 1.5% through year 15 after diagnosis,12 
regional recurrence in the ACOSOG Z0011 (Alliance) trial was rare after either SLND alone 
or ALND between years 5 and 10 even though more than 80% of patients had hormone 
receptor–positive tumors.13 These findings are compatible with those of the International 
Breast Cancer Study Group in which rates of regional recurrence in patients with estrogen 
receptor–positive tumors were seen to increase minimally from 5% to 6.2% between years 5 
and 10, with substantially greater increases in the rates of late local (8.8%–11.2%) and 
distant recurrence (23.4%–31.9%) observed.16
Because the patient characteristics were well balanced, any decrease in disease-free survival 
or overall survival in the SLND alone group would have been anticipated to occur due to an 
increase in regional recurrences; however, only a single regional recurrence was observed in 
the SLND alone group with additional follow-up in the ACOSOG Z0011 (Alliance) trial. 
Consistent with this finding, the incremental decreases in disease-free survival (3.7% for the 
SLND alone group and 4.0% for the ALND group) and overall survival (6.2% for the SLND 
alone group and 8.2% for the ALND group) between years 5 and 10 among patients 
undergoing either SLND alone or ALND were not meaningfully different. In an adjusted 
analysis, well documented prognostic factors such as age, hormone receptor status, tumor 
size, and the use of adjuvant therapy (but not elimination of ALND) were associated with 
overall survival.
Although the initial results of the ACOSOG Z0011 study generated controversy,17,18 
management of women in the United States with sentinel node metastases changed 
substantially as a result of the study. Among 701 consecutive patients with node-positive 
tumors at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who met ACOSOG Z0011 eligibility 
criteria, 83% did not have to undergo ALND.19 In a 12-hospital network, use of ALND 
decreased from 71% to 17% after development of a guideline using ACOSOG Z0011 
eligibility criteria and age of 50 years or older as indications for SLND alone.20
In a National Cancer Database study of 74 309 patients, Yao et al21 observed that use of 
SLND in patients meeting ACOSOG Z0011 eligibility criteria increased from 23% to 56% 
between 2009 and 2011. In that study, age younger than 50 years and a triple-negative 
subtype predicted a greater use of ALND, a practice neither supported by the reported 5-year 
outcomes of ACOSOG Z0011,9 nor by the findings of the current report. In ACOSOG

 Z0011, age was not significantly associated with locoregional recurrence after controlling 
for other factors.13 Studies examining the application of findings from ACOSOG Z0011 
among young women or among those with triple-negative breast cancer have found neither a 
greater need for ALND in these groups, nor heavier axillary tumor burdens in those 
undergoing ALND.19,22
The role of nodal irradiation, specifically in ACOSOG Z0011 and in the management of 
patients with node-positive breast cancer, is controversial. Although 19% of patients 
received prohibited third-field irradiation, nodal irradiation was distributed similarly by 
treatment group, as was omission of irradiation and the use of high–tangent-field 
irradiation,15 indicating that choice of radiotherapy fields was unlikely to have affected the 
study outcome. In addition, the unplanned analysis showed that no survival differences were 
observed among patients treated with conventional tangent-field irradiation or nodal-field 
irradiation.
Since the initial publication of ACOSOG Z0011,9 2 studies (the MA.2023 and the European 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer24 [EORTC] 22922/10925) examined the 
role of regional nodal irradiation in patients with similar characteristics (T1 or T2 and 1, 2, 
or 3 axillary nodal metastases) and their findings have caused some25 to question whether 
comprehensive nodal irradiation should be routine. In the MA.20 study,23 patients with 
node-positive tumors were randomized to axillary dissection or axillary dissection plus 
extensive postoperative nodal irradiation, including supraclavicular and internal mammary 
nodal basins. The EORTC 22922/10925 study24 randomized high-risk women 
postoperatively to whole-breast or chest-wall irradiation alone or with regional nodal 
irradiation. These studies, with 10 years of follow-up and 5836 enrolled patients, 
demonstrate a very modest 1% to 1.5% decrease in regional recurrence with nodal 
irradiation, and no significant difference in overall survival.
The 10-year rates of overall survival in the SLND alone and ALND groups of the ACOSOG 
Z0011 (Alliance) trial were 86.3% and 83.6%, respectively, compared with 82.8% in the 
nodal irradiation group in MA.20 and 82.3% in EORTC 22922/10925, suggesting that the 
ACOSOG Z0011 eligibility criteria identified a population that may not benefit from 
comprehensive nodal irradiation. Thus, although nodal irradiation may be added to the 
management of some patients with node-positive tumors based on an evaluation of their 
overall risk profile, the routine use of nodal irradiation for all patients with 1 or 2 sentinel 
node metastases managed with SLND alone may not be justified.
Ten years of follow-up confirm that women with 1 or 2 positive sentinel nodes and clinical 
T1 or T2 tumors undergoing lumpectomy with whole-breast irradiation and systemic therapy 
experience no worse local control, disease-free survival, or overall survival with elimination 
of ALND. Application of these findings in clinical practice has the potential to avoid the 
morbidity of ALND without diminution of survival outcomes in 61% to 83% of women with 
these characteristics.19,26 The routine use of ALND for all patients with positive sentinel 
nodes is no longer justified based on these 10-year overall survival results.

 However, these conclusions apply only to patients meeting ACOSOG Z0011 eligibility 
criteria and should not be extrapolated to the management of patients with positive palpable 
nodes, those with metastases in more than 2 sentinel nodes, patients forgoing whole-breast 
irradiation, those treated with mastectomy without radiation, or patients receiving 
neoadjuvant therapy because all of these are circumstances in which the elimination of 
ALND is not known to be safe. The ongoing Positive Sentinel Node-Adjuvant Therapy 
Alone vs Adjuvant Therapy Plus Clearance or Axillary Radiotherapy trial for women with 
metastases in 1 or 2 sentinel nodes treated with breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy 
will provide important information about the safety of omitting ALND after mastectomy, but 
this study is not expected to complete accrual until 2018.17
Limitations
This study has several limitations. Like most large randomized trials in breast cancer 
management, not all biological subtypes are represented in large numbers. Differences in 
outcomes may be seen for patients with different individual circumstances. However, not all 
biological subtypes can be analyzed for small variations in locoregional treatment. 
Furthermore, due to low accrual and the low event rate, the study did not reach the 
prespecified sample size of 1900 participants or 500 deaths. In addition, some patients had 
irradiation protocol variations that could have resulted in a small alteration of outcomes; 
however, these patients were distributed similarly in both study groups.
Conclusions
Among women with T1 or T2 invasive primary breast cancer, no palpable axillary 
adenopathy, and 1 or 2 sentinel lymph nodes containing metastases, 10-year overall survival 
for patients treated with sentinel lymph node dissection alone was noninferior to overall 
survival for those treated with axillary lymph node dissection. These findings do not support 
routine use of axillary lymph node dissection in this patient population based on 10-year 
outcomes.

 Key Points
Question
Is there any diminution in 10-year overall survival for women with cT1-2N0 breast 
cancer and metastases to 1 or 2 sentinel lymph nodes undergoing breast-conserving 
surgery, whole-breast irradiation, and adjuvant systemic therapy treated with sentinel 
node dissection alone compared with that of patients treated with axillary dissection?
Findings
In this randomized clinical trial including 856 women, after median follow-up of 9.3 
years, overall survival for patients treated with sentinel lymph node dissection alone was 
not inferior to those treated with completion axillary lymph node dissection (86.3% vs 
83.6%, respectively; noninferiority hazard ratio margin of 1.3).
Meaning
These findings do not support the use of axillary lymph node dissection when metastases 
are found with sentinel lymph node sampling in women with cT1-2M0 breast cancer.

 Figure 2. Overall and Disease-Free Survival in the ACOSOG Z0011 (Alliance) Trial
ACOSOG indicates American College of Surgeons Oncology Group; Alliance, Alliance for 
Clinical Trials in Oncology. In part A, there were 51 events in the sentinel lymph node 
dissection (SLND) alone group (n = 436) during a median follow-up of 9.3 years 
(interquartile range [IQR], 6.8–10.3 years) vs 59 events in the axillary lymph node 
dissection (ALND) group (n = 420) during a median follow-up of 9.4 years (IQR, 7.2–10.3 
years). In part B, there were 12 events in the ER- and PR-negative SLND alone group (n = 
64) during a median follow-up of 9.3 years (IQR, 7.7–10.7 years) with a hazard ratio of 1.71 
(95% CI, 0.88–3.34); 33 events in the ER- and PR-positive SLND alone group (n = 270)
