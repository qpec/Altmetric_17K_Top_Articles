Abstract 
Aggregation of Amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) is a key event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s 
disease (AD). We investigated the effects of nanoliposomes decorated with the retro-inverso 
peptide RI-OR2-TAT (Ac-rGffvlkGrrrrqrrkkrGy-NH2) on the aggregation and toxicity of Aβ. 
Remarkably low concentrations of these peptide inhibitor nanoparticles (PINPs) were 
required to inhibit the formation of Aβ oligomers and fibrils in vitro, with 50% inhibition 
occurring at a molar ratio of ~1:2000 of liposome-bound RI-OR2-TAT to Aβ. PINPs also 
bound to Aβ with high affinity (Kd = 13.2 - 50 nM), rescued SHSY-5Y cells from the toxic 
effect of pre-aggregated Aβ, crossed an in vitro blood-brain-barrier model (hCMEC/D3 cell 
monolayer), entered the brains of C57/BL6 mice, and protected against memory loss in 
APPSWE transgenic mice in a novel object recognition test. As the most potent aggregation 
inhibitor that we have tested so far, we propose to develop PINPs as a potential disease-
modifying treatment for AD.

Background 
There are currently ~36 million sufferers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) worldwide, 
costing the world economy US$604 billion in 2010, and these figures are set to rise 
dramatically in the future.1 Current drug treatments only temporarily alleviate the symptoms 
of AD. Characteristic pathological changes of the disease are the presence of abundant senile 
plaques, containing Amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) fibrils, and neurofibrillary tangles consisting of 
hyperphosphorylated Tau protein. However, Aβ oligomers are now thought to be the most 
toxic form of this peptide, with a potent ability to cause memory deficits and inhibition of 
oligomer formation is a potential strategy for disease modification therapy.2-8 It is also 
generally thought that Tau aggregation is a downstream consequence of Aβ aggregation.9 The 
most advanced clinical trials aimed at disease modification in AD are based on drugs 
targeting the production or clearance of Aβ.10 
We have published data on a small peptide (OR2 = H2N-RGKLVFFGR-NH2) that 
inhibits the formation of Aβ oligomers and fibrils.11 RI-OR2 is a much more stable retro-
inverted version of this peptide.12 The addition of retro-inverted ‘TAT’ (HIV cell-penetrating 
peptide) to RI-OR2 allows it to enter cells and cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB).13 
Treatment of APPswe/PS1∆E9 transgenic mice with RI-OR2-TAT caused reduction of brain 
Aβ burden (oligomers included), reduction of numbers of activated microglial cells, and an 
increase in the number of young neurons in the dentate gyrus.13 However, RI-OR2-TAT only 
inhibits Aβ aggregation when present at relatively high concentrations (i.e. 1:5 molar ratio of 
inhibitor: Aβ at best).13 
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of liposomes as carriers 
for therapeutic agents, because of their attractive characteristics, such as biocompatibility, 
biodegradability, and chemical and physical stability.14 Moreover, liposomes can be multi-
functionalized on their surface, and it has been shown that multi-ligand-decorated

nanosystems can be more efficient (compared to single ligand systems) at recognizing their 
molecular targets.15 In the present study, we have covalently attached RI-OR2-TAT to 
nanoliposomes (NL) using ‘click’ chemistry. We show that very low concentrations of these 
peptide inhibitor nanoparticles (PINPs) were required to inhibit the aggregation of Aβ and to 
protect cultured SHSY-5Y cells from the toxic effect of pre-aggregated Aβ. Moreover, they 
were efficient at crossing an in vitro BBB model, entered the brains of healthy mice, and 
protected against memory loss in APPSWE transgenic mice.

Production of NL decorated with RI-OR2-TAT (PINPs) by click chemistry 
NL were composed of Sm/Chol (1:1 molar ratio) mixed with 5 molar % of mal-PEG-
PE. Lipids were resuspended in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v:v) and dried under a gentle 
stream of nitrogen. The resulting film was resuspended in PBS, pH 7.4, vortexed and 
extruded 10 times through a 100 nm pore polycarbonate filter under 20 bar nitrogen pressure,

at room temperature, to create UD (undecorated) liposomes. In order to covalently attach the 
peptide to these liposomes, an additional cysteine residue was incorporated at the C-terminus. 
NL were incubated with this peptide for 2 h at 37°C and then overnight at 4°C to obtain 
PINPs. To remove unbound peptide, the liposome suspension was passed through a 
Sepharose 4B-CL column (25 x 1 cm). The elution of PINPs was assessed by Dynamic Light 
Scattering (DLS) and the amount of peptide bound to liposomes was quantified by Bradford 
assay.16 Phospholipid recovery was determined by the method of Stewart.17 
 
NL characterization 
The size and polydispersity of NL were measured at 25°C using a ZetaPlus particle 
sizer (Brookhaven Instruments Corporation, Holtsville, NY, USA). The particle size was 
assessed by DLS with a 652 nm laser, and polydispersity index was obtained from the 
intensity autocorrelation function of the light scattered at a fixed angle of 90°.  
The NL were also analysed by use of a Nanosight machine (NanoSight Ltd, Minton 
Park, Amesbury, UK) with NL suspended in PBS, pH 7.4, and measured at 25˚C. 
 
Aβ aggregation assays 
These were performed using de-seeded Aβ1-42.12  
ThT assays were conducted in 384-well, clear-bottomed microtitre plates, with 25 µM 
Aβ1-42, 15 µM ThT, and a range of concentrations of PINPs, in 10 mM PBS, pH 7.4, with a 
total reaction volume of 60 µL. Aggregation was monitored using a BioTek Synergy plate 
reader (λex=442 nm, λem=483 nm) over 48 h at 30°C, with the plate being shaken and read 
every 10 min. The results show average data from one of two experiments, each of which was 
performed in triplicate. Control assays involving incubation of pre-aggregated Aβ (incubated

at 25 μM for 24 h) with ThT in the presence of each inhibitor ruled out the possibility that the 
inhibitors interfere with binding of ThT to fibrils.12  
For the sandwich immunoassay, Aβ oligomers were captured by monoclonal antibody 
6E10 and detected by a biotinylated form of the same antibody.12 Briefly, 96-well plates 
(Maxisorb) were coated with 6E10, diluted 1:1000 in assay buffer (Tris-buffered saline 
(TBS) (pH 7.4), containing 0.05% γ-globulins and 0.005% Tween 20). The incubated 
samples of peptide, with or without liposome (12.5 μM Aβ and a series of dilutions of PINPs 
in PBS, pH 7.4, at 25˚C), were diluted to 1 μM Aβ and incubated, in triplicate, in the 96-well 
plates for 1 h at 37˚C. The plates were washed with 10 mM PBS, containing 0.5% Tween 20 
(PBS-T). Following this, 100 μL of TBS containing 1:1000 biotinylated 6E10 was added and 
the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37˚C and washed. Europium-linked streptavidin was 
added at 1:500 dilution in StrepE buffer (TBS containing 20 μM DTPA, 0.5% bovine serum 
albumin, and 0.05% γ-globulins), incubated for 1 h, and washed. Enhancer solution was 
added, and the plates were read on a Wallac Victor 2 plate reader. The results shown are 
average data from one of two experiments, each performed in triplicate. Pre-aggregated 
peptide controls ruled out the possibility that the inhibitors block binding of 6E10 to Aβ.12 
 
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) 
 
Aβ1-42 was incubated at 25 µM in the presence or absence of 1.25 µM PINPs (total 
lipids) in PBS, pH 7.4, for 24 h. Samples were diluted 1:10 in PBS and a 2 µL aliquot was 
deposited onto a mica surface coated with poly-L-lysine (PLL)18 and allowed to dry. Images 
were obtained in tapping mode using a Multimode™SPM NanoScope IIIa microscope 
(Digital Instruments, New York, USA). The silicon cantilever tips were 125 µm long, 30 µm 
wide and had a radius <10 nm (Budget Sensors, Bulgaria). The resonance frequency was 
300 kHz and force constants 40 N/m. All images were first order flattened and edited using

Electron microscopy (EM) studies of PINPs incubated with Aβ 
 
Negative stain EM was used to examine the structure of PINPs with and without 
incubation with Aβ. PINPS alone, or PINPs (25 µM total lipids) incubated with Aβ1-42 
(25 µM) at 37oC for 48 h, were pipetted (4 µl) onto 300 mesh formvar and carbon coated 
copper grids (Agar Scientific, UK) and left for 1 min. The solvent was blotted away and the 
residue stained using 2% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid (PTA), pH 7.4. Immunogold labelling 
experiments were performed to identify any Aβ captured by PINPs. Here, the grids were 
blocked for 15 mins in goat serum:PBS (1:10) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 
primary anti-Aβ antibody 6E10 (0.02 µl/ml). After washing, they were incubated with 10 nm 
colloidal gold-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (G7777, Sigma-Aldrich) 
diluted 1/50 in PBS, for 2 h. After washing, any liquid remaining on the grids was blotted 
away, and the samples were stained with PTA. Grids were left to dry and examined by TEM. 
 
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy 
 
SPR experiments were conducted using a Sensi Q semi-automatic SPR machine (ICx 
Nomadics). This apparatus has two parallel flow cells; one was used to immobilize Aβ1-42 
monomers, oligomers or fibrils, while the other was used as “reference” (empty surface). A 
COOH5 sensor chip (ICx Nomadics) was employed for this purpose and the peptide was 
immobilized by amine coupling chemistry. Briefly, after surface activation, the peptide was 
diluted to 10 μM in acetate buffer (pH 4.0) and injected for 5 min at a flow rate of 30 μL/min. 
Any remaining activated groups were blocked with ethanolamine (pH 8.0). The final 
immobilization level was ~5000 resonance units (1 RU = 1 pg of protein/mm2). The empty 
“reference” surface was prepared in parallel using the same immobilization procedure, but

without addition of peptide. Sensorgrams were obtained via injection of four different 
concentrations of PINPs (0.3 µM, 0.6 µM, 0.9 µM, 1.2 µM of exposed peptide) in solution 
(PBS with 0.005% Tween 20), over the immobilized ligand or control surface, in parallel, at 
the same time. These SPR data can be interpreted to provide an estimate for affinity of 
binding of liposomes to Aβ.12,13 
 
MTS/LDH assay 
 
Cultured SHSY-5Y human neuroblastoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s 
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco) containing 10% Fetal Calf Serum, 100 U/mL 
penicillin, 50 µg/mL streptomycin, at 37ºC and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Cells were 
transferred to sterile 96-well growth plates at 20,000 cells per well and four wells per 
condition. For the effect of PINPs alone on cells, the growth medium was DMEM. Cells were 
left to adhere for 24 h before the PINPs were added and cell viability was assessed using the 
CellTiter 96AqueousOne Solution Cell Proliferation (MTS) Assay kit (Promega) after further 
24 h incubation. For the experiments looking at the protective effect of PINPS, the growth 
medium was changed to Optimem (Invitrogen) and Aβ1-42 that had been pre-aggregated (for 
24 h at 25ºC in PBS) was added to a concentration of 5 µM. The plates were returned to the 
incubator for 24 h and cell proliferation was assessed as above. 
 
Uptake and transcytosis of NL by human brain endothelial cells 
 
Immortalized hCMEC/D3 were cultured as described previously.20 5 × 104 cells/cm2 
were seeded on 12-well transwell inserts coated with type I collagen and cultured with 0.5 
mL and 1 mL of culture medium in the upper and lower chamber, respectively. Cells were 
treated with UD liposomes and PINPs when the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) 
value (measured by EVOMX meter, STX2 electrode; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota,

FL, USA) was found to be the highest. The functional properties of cell monolayers were 
assessed by measuring the endothelial permeability (EP) of [14C]-sucrose and [3H]-
propranolol (between 0 and 120 mins) as described previously.21 Radiolabeled NL (0.5 mL; 
400 nmols/mL of total lipids) were added to the upper chamber and incubated for 120 min. 
After these periods of incubation, the radioactivity in the upper and lower chambers was 
measured by liquid scintillation counting to calculate the EP of NL across the cell 
monolayers, taking account of their passage through the filter without cells.21 After 2 h, 
hCMEC/D3 cells were washed with PBS and detached from the transwell inserts with 
trypsin/EDTA for 15 mins at 37°C. Cell-associated radioactivity was measured and the total 
lipid uptake calculated. 
 
Assessment of LIP cytotoxicity on hCMEC/D3 cells 
 
hCMEC/D3 cells were grown on 12-well plates until confluence. Medium was 
replaced and NL (400 nmols/mL of total lipids) suspended in cell culture medium were 
incubated at 37°C with the cells for 24 h. After treatment, the cell viability was assessed by 
([3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide]) (MTT) assay, as described 
previously.22 Each sample was analyzed at least in triplicate. Moreover, TEER and 
permeability of [14C]-sucrose were also determined in the presence of NL to assess the effect 
of NL on monolayer integrity. 
 
Biodistribution in healthy mice 
 
Three C57/BL6 male mice were administered with 0.4 mM (total lipid) of 14C-
labelled cholesterol PINPs, at ~2.22 x 108 dpm/kg, into a tail vein. The amount of 
radioactivity that reached the brain was assessed by quantitative whole body analysis 
(QWBA), while the concentration in blood was measured by liquid scintillation counter from

samples taken prior to sacrifice. This work was performed by Quotient Bioresearch 
(Rushden) Ltd, using mice supplied by Charles Rivers UK Ltd., Margate, Kent. 
 
Novel object recognition test in Tg mice 
Drug and behavioral test naïve twenty-two-month-old Tg2576 (APPSWE) and WT age-
matched littermates were used. All experiments were conducted during the light cycle. 
Animals (Tg or WT) were injected intraperitoneally with PINPs (100 µl, 100 nmol of 
peptide/kg) or with PBS (100 µl) once a day for 21 days. The weight of the animals was 
monitored during treatment. Two experimental groups were treated with PINPs (Tg2576 and 
WT mice, n=10 for each), two control groups were treated with PBS (Tg2576 and WT, n=10 
for each). In the NOR test, mice are introduced into an arena containing two identical objects 
that they can explore freely. Twenty-four hours later, mice are reintroduced into the arena 
containing the familiar object and a novel object. Exploration was recorded in a 10 min trial 
by an investigator blinded to the genotype and treatment and the time that each object was 
explored recorded. Results are expressed as percentage time of investigation on objects per 
10 min, or as discrimination index (DI), i.e., (seconds spent on novel - seconds spent on 
familiar)/(total time spent on objects). Animals with no memory impairment spend a longer 
time investigating the novel object, giving a higher DI. 
All procedures involving animals and their care were conducted according to EU laws 
and policies (EEC Council Directive 86/609, OJ L 358,1; 12 December 1987), the USDA 
Animal Welfare Act and NIH (Bethesda, MA, USA) policy on Humane Care and Use of 
Laboratory Animals. The procedures were reviewed and approved by the Mario Negri 
Institute Animal Care and Use Committee (1/04-D).

Results 
Preparation and characterization of peptide inhibitor nanoparticles (PINPs) 
To attach RI-OR2-TAT (Figure 1, A) covalently to the NL surface, we exploited a 
thiol-maleimide reaction employing an additional cysteine residue to provide the necessary 
thiol group.23 This thiol function at the C-terminus of RI-OR2-TAT reacted with a 
maleimide-functionalized phospholipid present in the NL formulation (mal-PEG-PE) (Figure 
1, B). The yield of coupling was 80-90% and, consequently, PINPs contained 2-2.5 mol% of 
peptide. The total lipid recovery of NL, after the reaction with the peptide and the purification 
step, was about 65%. Final preparations of PINPs were monodispersed, with a mean size of 
143 ± 10 nm as determined by DLS. Their stability was verified by DLS which showed that 
the size and polydispersity index remained constant, in PBS, for up to 7 days. Analysis by a 
Nanosight instrument indicated an average size for PINPs of 131 ± 43 nm (Figure 1, C). 
AFM images showed NL particles with a mean diameter of ~100 nm (Figure 1, D), this 
slightly smaller size being most likely due to some dehydration of the sample.  
 
Effects of PINPs on Aβ aggregation 
RI-OR2-TAT alone was shown by ThT assay to inhibit Aβ1-42 aggregation up to a 
molar ratio of 1:5 (inhibitor to Aβ1-42), in agreement with previous data for RI-OR2 and 
RI-OR2-TAT12,13. When RI-OR2-TAT was attached to liposomes there was a dramatic 
improvement in ability to inhibit Aβ1-42 fibril formation at low inhibitor concentrations 
(Figure 2, A). This finding is best illustrated in the dilution series shown in Figure 2, B. Here, 
it can be seen that 50% inhibition occurs at around 1:50 molar ratio of lipid to Aβ1-42 or, as 
the inhibitory peptide is only ~2.5% of total lipids, ~1:2000 of RI-OR2-TAT to Aβ1-42. In 
contrast, when UD liposomes (1:1) were tested for their ability to inhibit Aβ1-42 aggregation, 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
13 
 
we found a slight stimulatory effect at higher ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 (lipid:Aβ1-42) but no effect 
below 1:10 (data not shown). 
A sensitive immunoassay was used to detect Aβ oligomers present at the earlier Aβ1-42 
incubation time points (at around 4 h under our experimental conditions).12,13 PINPs inhibited 
the generation of an immunoassay signal at all time points examined, and at molar ratios 
down to as low as 1:100 lipid:Aβ1-42 or 1:4000 inhibitory peptide:Aβ1-42 (Figure 2, C). The 
slight differences between ThT assay and ELISA results could reflect the fact that the former 
detects mainly fibrils, whereas the latter detects oligomers. 
AFM images showed fibrils of Aβ1-42 following 6 days of incubation in PBS (Figure 
3, A) and when incubated with UD liposomes (Figure 3, B). Few or no fibrils were detected 
when PINPs were present at a molar ratio of 1:10 of total lipids:Aβ (Figure 3, C), confirming 
that they inhibit aggregation. However, some structures possibly resembling small aggregates 
could be seen, suggesting that PINPs may not entirely inhibit aggregation. Negative stain EM 
revealed that the surface of the PINPs was smooth and their shape was generally spherical. 
However, when the PINPs were incubated with Aβ1-42 they appeared to be covered with a 
‘furry’ coat of what are possibly Aβ monomers or oligomers (Figure 3, D). Intriguingly, some 
PINPs were found attached along the length of Aβ fibrils, and at their free ends, suggesting 
that the interaction of the PINPs had resulted in termination of fibril growth (Figure 3, D). 
Further investigation with anti-Aβ immunogold labelling showed that the surface of the 
PINPs was decorated with gold particles, confirming capture of Aβ (Figure 3, E). 
 
Binding affinity between PINPs and Aβ 
PINPs were injected over immobilized Aβ fibrils at different concentrations of RI-
OR2-TAT (0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2 µM) and were shown to bind in a concentration-dependent 
manner (Figure 4). Curves were fitted separately using the simplest Langmuir 1:1 interaction

model, and the calculated apparent affinity (kd) was 36-50 nM. In addition, kd values were 
13.2 nM for Aβ oligomers and 22.5 nM for monomers (see Supplementary Information). 
 
Effects of PINPs on the toxicity of Aβ  
There was no loss in viability of SHSY-5Y cells, as measured by MTS assay, after 
24 h incubation in the presence of PINPs at concentrations as high as 10 µM (total lipid) in 
normal (FCS supplemented DMEM) growth medium (Figure 5, A). A similar result was also 
found using the LDH cell viability assay (data not shown). Treatment of SHSY-5Y cells with 
5 µM Aβ for 24 h gave a 39% reduction in cell viability, and the presence of PINPs rescued 
the cells from Aβ toxicity at all doses tested (Figure 5, B). UD liposomes were not toxic to 
neuroblastoma cells (Figure 5, A), and they did not rescue cells from the toxic effect of pre-
aggregated Aβ (Figure 5, B). 
 
Passage of PINPs across the blood-brain barrier  
We measured the ability of PINPs to cross an artificial BBB model composed of a 
hCMEC/D3 cell monolayer.24 hCMEC/D3 cells grown on transwell membrane inserts were 
incubated with UD liposomes or PINPs on day 12, when the maximal transendothelial 
electrical resistance (TEER) value was registered (123 ± 6 Ω ⋅ cm2). Transport of 
[14C]-sucrose and [3H]-propranolol was measured, with paracellular EP values of 1.48 × 10−3 
cm/min and 3.51 × 10−3 cm/min, respectively, in agreement with values reported in the 
literature.25 Radiolabelled UD liposomes or PINPs were added in the upper compartment and 
the cellular uptake and EP were measured up to 2 h of incubation. The radioactivity stably 
associated with cells was 1.19 ± 0.32% and 4.19 ± 0.24% of the administered dose (p<0.05), 
respectively for UD liposomes and PINPs (Figure 6, A). Also the EP across the cell 
monolayers was higher for PINPs (1.08 ± 0.13 × 10−4 cm/minute), compared to UD

liposomes (2.25 ± 0.89 × 10−5 cm/minute) (p<0.05) (Figure 6, B). MTT assays showed that 
all of the preparations tested were nontoxic. Moreover, after hCMEC/D3 incubation with UD 
liposomes or PINPs, the TEER value and the permeability of [14C]-sucrose (119 ± 8 Ω ⋅ cm2 
and 1.62 × 10−3 cm/minute, respectively) did not change, within experimental error (<3%).  
 
Biodistribution of PINPs in healthy mice 
 
QWBA measurements for biodistribution of PINPs are detailed in Table 1. Fifteen 
minutes after administration, 0.49%/g of the total dose was found in the brain and 0.952%/g 
in the blood, showing evidence for BBB penetration. However, the majority of the dose was 
found in lungs (~92%), and other tissues associated with phagocytosis by the mononuclear 
phagocyte system (i.e. adipose tissue, liver, bone marrow and spleen). 
 
NOR (memory) test 
 
Figure 7 shows that, although PBS-treated Tg2576 mice were unable to discriminate 
between the familiar and the novel object (percentage time of investigation per 10 min: 
familiar, 53.5 ± 1.5; novel, 46.5 ± 1.5; DI, -0.07 ± 0.03; n = 19), after treatment mice 
receiving PINPs significantly recovered their long term recognition memory (percentage time 
of investigation per 10 min: familiar, 40.4 ± 1.6; novel, 59.6 ± 1.6; DI, 0.19 ± 0.03; n = 10), 
close to the values of PBS-treated WT mice (percentage time of investigation per 10 min: 
familiar, 39.6 ± 1.4; novel, 60.4 ± 1.4; DI, 0.23 ± 0.02; n = 10) (One-way ANOVA,  Tukey’s 
post hoc test. *p<0.05). In addition, we demonstrated that treatment with PINPs had no 
negative effect on the memory of WT mice (percentage time of investigation per 10 min: 
familiar, 37.5 ± 4.7; novel, 62.5 ± 3.4; DI, 0.25 ± 0.09; n = 10) and did not affect mouse 
weight and motor activity (data not shown).

Discussion 
Here, we linked RI-OR2-TAT covalently to the surface of NL composed of 
sphingomyelin and cholesterol. This lipid formulation has been widely utilized in vivo for 
therapeutic purposes and displays good blood circulation times, good biocompatibility, and 
high resistance to hydrolysis.26 In addition, the 130-140 nm diameter is optimal for moving at 
an appreciable rate through the brain extracellular space.27 We found that the presence of the 
carrier appears to increase the potency of RI-OR2-TAT as an aggregation inhibitor by 10-20 
fold, where this is determined by the molar ratio of inhibitor:Aβ required to block the 
aggregation of Aβ1-42 under standard experimental conditions. We did not observe this 
phenomenon with curcumin-NL28 and so it is not completely clear why there is this 
considerable jump in potency for PINPs compared to free peptide. However, creating 
multivalent peptide-dendrimers has been shown to increase the efficacy of a KLVFF peptide 
aggregation inhibitor29 and this may be a factor in our study, due to several inhibitory 
peptides being able to interact simultaneously with oligomeric Aβ.  
We reported previously a large increase in the affinity of RI-OR2-TAT for Aβ 
(Kd = 58-125 nM) compared to RI-OR2 alone (Kd = 9-12 µM), but this is not reflected in an 
equivalent jump in the ability of RI-OR2-TAT to inhibit Aβ aggregation at low 
concentrations of inhibitor.12,13 We can conclude from this that an increase in binding affinity 
does not necessarily result in a more potent aggregation inhibitor. Here, we found that the 
affinity of PINPs for Aβ (Kd = 13.2-50 nM) is slightly higher than that obtained previously 
for RI-OR2-TAT, but the ability of PINPs to inhibit Aβ aggregation at low concentrations of 
the inhibitory peptide was greatly improved. In addition to multivalent interactions between 
RI-OR2-TAT and Aβ, another possible explanation for the potency of PINPs is based on the 
fact that RI-OR2-TAT contains many positively charged amino acid residues and the 
presence of multiple copies of this peptide on the NL surface (each PINP has around 1600 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
17 
 
molecules of RI-OR2-TAT attached) would give a highly positively charged external layer 
that could attract and capture Aβ monomers, or oligomers as they form.30 It is also feasible 
that Aβ is captured by the peptides exposed on the NL surface and is then incorporated into 
the lipid component of the NL, so effectively removing Aβ from solution. It is well known 
that Aβ oligomers insert into lipid membranes of cells and form pores or ion channels.31-33 
The TAT portion of RI-OR-TAT, with its positively charged amino acid residues, also 
confers on the inhibitor an ability to cross the BBB and reach the brain.13 Here we show that 
this ability is maintained for PINPs. The PE of NL, using the in vitro BBB model, was much 
higher for PINPs than for UD liposomes, proving the effectiveness of the functionalized NL 
to flux across the cellular monolayer. Moreover, some PINPs are transported into the brain, 
through the BBB of healthy mice, and they show a protective effect on memory loss in 
Tg2576 mice. It is also possible that this is due to the ‘sink’ effect with the liposomes rapidly 
binding Aβ in blood before being removed, and this is driving export of Aβ from the brain. 
Other NP-based treatments for AD are under investigation, including antibody-coated 
NP and secretase inhibitors as well as our previously published curcumin and lipid-ligand 
linked NL28,34-38 Despite promising preclinical data, no secretase inhibitor has succeeded in 
any advanced clinical trial39 and, considering the serious side effects reported for 
immunisation with anti-Aβ antibodies40, anti-Aβ-coated NP could be problematic. In contrast, 
PINPs have ‘stealth’ properties and so should not elicit any immune response. Moreover, the 
aggregation of Aβ seems to be a purely pathological phenomenon, and so inhibition of this 
process should not result in problematic side-effects.  
In addition to these therapeutic implications, PINPs also have potential as a molecular 
imaging agent.41 The high affinity of RI-OR2-TAT for Aβ should allow specific labeling of 
amyloid plaques, and possibly Aβ oligomers, through addition of a relevant contrast agent 
(CT/MRI) or radiolabel (PET/SPECT) to form a multifunctional NP with ‘theranostic’ utility.

Graphical Abstract 
 
Retro-inverso peptides attached to the surface of nanoliposomes prevent the aggregation of β-
amyloid monomers into oligomers and fibrils. The ‘ffvlk’ sequence of the inhibitory peptide 
is designed to interact with the ‘KLVFF’ sequence on the Aβ molecule. However, Aβ could 
also interact with the positive charge of the ‘TAT’ sequence and Aβ oligomers, once 
captured, could insert themselves into the lipid bilayer of the liposomes.
