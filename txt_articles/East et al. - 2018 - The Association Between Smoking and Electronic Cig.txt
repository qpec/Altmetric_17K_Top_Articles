Purpose: Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is associated with smoking initiation among young
people; however, it is also possible that smoking is associated with e-cigarette initiation. This study
explores these associations among young people in Great Britain.
Methods: A longitudinal survey of 1,152 11- to 18-year-olds was conducted with baseline in April
2016 and follow-up between August and October 2016. Logistic regression models and causal me-
diation analyses assessed whether (1) ever e-cigarette use and escalation were associated with
smoking initiation (ever smoking at follow-up) among baseline never smokers (n = 923), and (2)
ever smoking and escalation were associated with e-cigarette initiation (ever e-cigarette use at
follow-up) among baseline never e-cigarette users (n = 1,020).
Results: At baseline, 19.8% were ever smokers and 11.4% were ever e-cigarette users. Respon-
dents who were ever e-cigarette users (vs. never users, 53% vs. 8%, odds ratio [OR] = 11.89, 95%
confidence interval [CI] = 3.56–39.72) and escalated their e-cigarette use (vs. did not, 41% vs. 8%,
OR = 7.89, 95% CI = 3.06–20.38) were more likely to initiate smoking. Respondents who were ever
smokers (vs. never smokers, 32% vs. 4%, OR = 3.54, 95% CI = 1.68–7.45) and escalated their smoking
(vs. did not, 34% vs. 6%, OR = 5.79, 95% CI = 2.55–13.15) were more likely to initiate e-cigarette use.
There was a direct effect of ever e-cigarette use on smoking initiation (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.05–
1.72), and ever smoking on e-cigarette initiation (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.01–1.17); e-cigarette and
smoking escalation, respectively, did not mediate these effects.
IMPLICATIONS AND
CONTRIBUTION
This
study
employs
a
causal inference approach
to provide further support
for the association between
ever e-cigarette use and
smoking initiation, and ad-
ditionally finds that ever
smoking is associated with
e-cigarette
initiation,
among young people.

There are an estimated 2.9 million current adult electronic cig-
arette (e-cigarette) users in Great Britain [1]. Concerns have been
expressed about the impact of e-cigarette use on cigarette
smoking, particularly among young people [2–4]. There is some
evidence that trial of e-cigarettes among young people aged 11–
18 years in Great Britain is rising (from 3.7% in 2013 to 9.3% in
2016) [5]. However, regular (at least monthly) use among young
people is low, and increases in regular use are mainly restricted
to current smokers (from 20.2% in 2015 to 27.2% in 2016), with
regular use by never smokers remaining rare (.6% in 2015 to .4%
in 2016) [5].
Cross-sectional studies have found that young people who use
e-cigarettes are more likely to smoke [6,7], intend to smoke [8,9],
and be susceptible to smoking [10] than those who do not. On
the other hand, among young people in Great Britain, ex- and
current smokers are more likely to intend to use e-cigarettes than
never smokers [11]. It is therefore difficult to determine whether
there is any causality, and it is likely that there is an underlying
factor driving both smoking and e-cigarette use.
Several longitudinal studies of U.S. youth have found base-
line e-cigarette use is associated with smoking initiation [12–17],
past six-month smoking [18], and past-month smoking [19] at
follow-up. A meta-analysis of these studies has confirmed the
strength and consistency of these associations [4], and the as-
sociation between ever e-cigarette use and smoking initiation has
since been replicated in England [20] and Scotland [21].
Although each of the above studies exploring the associa-
tion between e-cigarette use and smoking control for a variety
of factors associated with smoking, there remains the presence
of extraneous variables, which may be related to both smoking
and e-cigarette use. Furthermore, some researchers propose that
certain psychosocial processes lead to vulnerability to any drug
use [22,23]. One study [18] explored whether the association
between smoking and e-cigarettes works both ways, and found
that not only was use of e-cigarettes at baseline associated with
past six-month smoking at follow-up, but also smoking at base-
line was associated with past six-month e-cigarette use at follow-
up. Furthermore, among young people in Argentina, current
smoking was associated with e-cigarette initiation one and a half
years later [24].
Despite the above research, the relative contributions of
e-cigarette use to smoking initiation, and smoking to e-cigarette
initiation, have not been formally assessed. All studies in this field
with the exception of Wills and colleagues [15] have relied on
standard regression models [12–14,16–21,24], which allow only
limited conclusions to be drawn regarding the pathways between
these products. Therefore, in this study, we have included causal
mediation analyses [25] to investigate the causal influence of
e-cigarette use on smoking initiation, and smoking on e-cigarette
initiation.
This study is the first to our knowledge to explore the longi-
tudinal association between (1) ever e-cigarette use and smoking
initiation (ever smoking at follow-up) among baseline never
smokers, and (2) ever smoking and e-cigarette initiation (ever
e-cigarette use at follow-up) among baseline never e-cigarette
users, among young people in Great Britain. We additionally
explore whether escalation of each product between baseline and
follow-up is associated with initiation of the alternative product,
and employ causal mediation analyses for the identification of
mediating factors [25] to investigate specific pathways between
the two products.
Methods
Design
This study used data from the 2016 Action on Smoking and
Health Great Britain Youth longitudinal survey. A non-probability
quota sampling approach was adopted using Ipsos MORI’
s online
panels to recruit respondents aged 11–18 years. Quotas were set
in respect of age, gender, and Government Office Region (GOR)
using data from Eurostat 2012 to ensure sample representative-
ness. Respondents were invited by email to participate in an online
survey about smoking between April 6 and 20 with follow-up
between August 5 and October 7, 2016. Up to eight email re-
minders were sent to maximize follow-up rates. Each wave took
approximately 10 minutes to complete, and financial incen-
tives were provided via a prize draw. Informed consent to take
part in the surveys was provided either by the parents of those
aged 11–15 years or by those individuals aged 16–18 years. Ethical
approval for the analyses in this paper was not required as this
study used secondary pre-existing data.
Ipsos MORI’
s online panel applicants consist of volunteers from
the general public. These panel applicants are validated by a
means of sophisticated vetting procedures using a variety of re-
cruitment channels. Shortly after joining, panelists’survey-
taking behavior is tested, with those most likely to make
intentional or unintentional errors on future surveys deacti-
vated. Subsequently, panelists’behavior is monitored and tracked
across all surveys for quality reasons.
Sample
The baseline survey was completed by 2,916 respondents aged
11–18 years, of whom 1,469 (50%) successfully completed the
follow-up survey. We excluded 317 respondents (22%) who had
never heard of e-cigarettes and selected “don’
t know” or “prefer
not to say” to some questions (see full breakdown in Figure 1).
This left a final study sample of 1,152, of whom 923 (80%) were
baseline never smokers and 1,020 (89%) were baseline never
e-cigarette users (Figure 1).
Measures
Smoking and e-cigarette status. At baseline, respondents were clas-
sified as never smokers (never smoked, not even a puff) or ever
smokers; at follow-up, respondents were classified as never
smokers or initiated smoking (never smokers at baseline but ever
540
K. East et al. / Journal of Adolescent Health 62 (2018) 539–547
 smokers at follow-up). At follow-up, respondents were further
classified as having escalated smoking (increased their smoking
between baseline and follow-up, e.g., escalating from never
smoking to trying smoking, from smoking sometimes to smoking
between one and six cigarettes a week) or not escalated smoking.
Respondents were classified using the same procedure for
e-cigarette use. Respondents who had never heard of e-cigarettes
(n = 178), and those who responded with “Prefer not to say” or
“Don’
t know” to the smoking or e-cigarette question at either
baseline or follow-up (n = 65) were excluded from all analyses.
Full item wording and response options are available in Table A1
(Supplementary Data).
Covariates (assessed at baseline only). Age (11–13, 14–15, 16–
18), gender (male, female), school performance (1–4, below
average to excellent), problem behavior (2–8, 8 = greater problem
behavior), monthly alcohol use (yes, no), smoking susceptibili-
ty (susceptible, not susceptible) [26], e-cigarette susceptibility
(susceptible, not susceptible—to mirror smoking susceptibility
[26]), some friends smoke (yes, no, not applicable/don’
t know),
some friends use e-cigarettes (yes, no, not applicable/don’
t know),
at least one parent smokes (yes, no), at least one parent uses
e-cigarettes (yes, no), sibling(s) smoke (yes, no, not applicable/
don’
t know), sibling(s) use e-cigarettes (yes, no, not applicable/
don’
t know), public approve of smoking (yes, no), and public
approve of e-cigarettes (yes, no) [27]. For school performance,
problem behavior, monthly alcohol use, and smoking and
e-cigarette susceptibility, “Don’
t know” and “Prefer not to say”
responses were excluded from all analyses. Covariates specific
to smoking were selected based on the previous literature
[12,15,18,26–28] and friend, parental, and sibling e-cigarette use
and public approval of e-cigarettes were also included to mirror
the similar smoking measures and to explore potential shared
risk factors for each product. Full item wording, response options,
and further details on coding for all covariates are available in
Table A1 (Supplementary Data).
Statistical analysis
We used unadjusted logistic regressions to compare respon-
dents lost to follow-up with those retained and included in the
study sample. We then used chi-square tests to compare smoking
and e-cigarette status at baseline and follow-up. We used un-
adjusted and adjusted logistic regressions to explore the
associations between (1) ever e-cigarette use at baseline and
e-cigarette escalation between baseline and follow-up with
smoking initiation at follow-up among baseline never smokers
(n = 923), and (2) ever smoking at baseline and smoking esca-
lation between baseline and follow-up with e-cigarette initiation
at follow-up among baseline never e-cigarette users (n = 1,020).
In adjusted models, we adjusted for all covariates described in
the Measures section.
To decompose the causal effect of e-cigarette use on smoking
initiation, and smoking on e-cigarette initiation, we used causal
mediation analyses using the parametric g-computation proce-
dure [25]. Mediation analyses go beyond standard regression

 models, which can estimate the associations between use of both
products, by disentangling different pathways that could explain
the effect of an exposure on an outcome. Furthermore, when a
potential mediator is treated as confounder in standard regres-
sion models, spurious associations may arise. The most commonly
used mediation analysis in epidemiology is based on the Baron
and Kenny approach [29], in which the total effect of an expo-
sure on an outcome, the effect of the exposure explained by a
given set of mediators (indirect effect), and the effect of the ex-
posure unexplained by those same mediators (direct effect) can
be defined. This approach has four main problems as it (1)
assumes no unmeasured confounding between mediator and
outcome, (2) assumes no interactions between exposure and me-
diator on outcome, (3) does not extend to nonlinear models, and
(4) assumes correctly specified models.
Causal mediation analysis has arisen from the causal infer-
ence literature [30] and addressed problems of the Baron and
Kenny approach [29] under the potential outcomes framework,
first by defining (using potential outcomes) precisely what is
meant by direct and indirect effects, second by giving clear as-
sumptions under which they can be identified, and third by
generalizing the statistical methods available for carrying out such
analyses to allow for nonlinearities, interactions, discrete out-
comes, and semiparametric estimation [31]. We therefore use the
parametric g-computation procedure under this framework as
it can quantify reliable direct and indirect causal effects for binary
variables, and produces narrow confidence intervals to allow for
stronger conclusions to be made regarding observed associa-
tions [25,32]. The g-computation procedure is discussed in detail
elsewhere [25,31,32], but primarily relies on the parametric mod-
eling assumptions shared with logistic regression and, to infer
causality, assumes no unmeasured confounding. It has been
applied to survey data previously [33].
To assess the causal influence of e-cigarette use on smoking
initiation, we specified a direct effect from ever e-cigarette use
at baseline to smoking initiation at follow-up and an indirect effect
acting through e-cigarette escalation between baseline and follow-
up (mediator). We used the same approach to assess the causal
influence of ever smoking on e-cigarette initiation at follow-up
with smoking escalation between baseline and follow-up acting
as a mediator. The causal diagrams for each model are shown in
Figure 2. In the causal mediation analyses, all covariates de-
scribed in the Measures section were specified as baseline
confounders. The g-computation estimates were converted to odds
ratios via exponentiation.
For attrition analysis and causal mediation analyses, we used
unweighted data; for all other analyses, we used weighted data
unless otherwise specified. Data were weighted according to age,
gender, and GOR using data from the Eurostat 2012, and ad-
justed for attrition on age, gender, GOR, ever smoking, and ever
e-cigarette use. Missing data were excluded listwise from all anal-
yses (see Figure 1).
Results
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the study sample at base-
line (n = 1,152) compared with respondents lost to follow-up and
who would have otherwise been excluded (because of not having
heard of e-cigarettes or selecting “don’
t know” or “prefer not to
say”on key variables and covariates) (n = 1,225). Respondents were
more likely to be lost to follow-up if they had ever smoked and
ever used an e-cigarette, and also differed on all covariates in-
cluded in the study except smoking susceptibility and having at
least one parent who uses e-cigarettes.
At baseline, 229 respondents (19.9%) had ever smoked
(Table 1), and this increased to 301 (26.0%) at follow-up
(χ2 = 834.32, p < .001). Of the 229 baseline ever smokers, 111
(48.5%) were also ever e-cigarette users; of the 923 baseline never
smokers, 21 (2.3%) were ever e-cigarette users. At baseline, 132
respondents (11.5%) had ever used an e-cigarette (Table 1), in-
creasing to 204 (17.6%) at follow-up (χ2 = 761.74, p < .001). Of the
132 baseline ever e-cigarette users, 111 (84.0%) were also ever
smokers; of the 1,020 baseline never e-cigarette users, 118 (11.6%)
were ever smokers. At baseline, only 56 (4.9%) respondents
smoked monthly or more and 24 (2.1%) used an e-cigarette
monthly or more.
Compared with baseline never e-cigarette users, ever
e-cigarette users were more likely to initiate smoking at follow-
up (Table 2). Furthermore, respondents who escalated e-cigarette
use between baseline and follow-up were also more likely to ini-
tiate smoking at follow-up compared with those who did not
(Table 2).
Compared with baseline never smokers, ever smokers were
more likely to initiate e-cigarette use at follow-up (Table 3). Fur-
thermore, respondents who escalated smoking between baseline
and follow-up were also more likely to initiate e-cigarette use
at follow-up compared with those who did not (Table 3).
Having some friends who use an e-cigarette reduced the like-
lihood of smoking initiation (Table 2) but increased the likelihood
of e-cigarette initiation (Table 3). Being older, susceptible to
smoking, and having at least one parent who smokes were as-
sociated with an increased likelihood of smoking initiation
(Table 2). Monthly alcohol use and no perceived public approv-
al of smoking were associated with an increased likelihood of
e-cigarette initiation (Table 3).

 In the causal mediation analysis (Figure 2, model A), base-
line ever e-cigarette use had a direct causal effect on smoking
initiation at follow-up (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, 95% confidence in-
terval [CI] = 1.05–1.72, p = .018), and there was a significant total
causal effect of the model (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.04–1.74, p = .022).
However, there was no indirect effect of baseline ever e-cigarette
use on smoking initiation at follow-up mediated by e-cigarette
escalation between baseline and follow-up (OR = 1.00, 95% CI = .91–
1.11, p = .983).
In the causal mediation analysis (Figure 2, model B), base-
line ever smoking had a direct causal effect on e-cigarette initiation
at follow-up (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.01–1.17, p = .034), and there was
a significant total causal effect of the model (OR = 1.11, 95%
CI = 1.03–1.20, p = .006). However, there was no indirect effect of
baseline ever smoking on e-cigarette initiation at follow-up me-
diated by smoking escalation between baseline and follow-up
(OR = 1.03, 95% CI = .99–1.06, p = .106).
Discussion
This study was the first to explore the longitudinal associa-
tion between e-cigarette use and smoking initiation, and smoking
and e-cigarette initiation among young people in Great Britain,
and to assess the relative contribution of these associations using
a causal inference approach. In the logistic regression analyses,
we found evidence for a prospective association between ever
e-cigarette use and smoking initiation, and between ever smoking
and e-cigarette initiation. We also found that escalation of each
product (e-cigarettes and smoking) between baseline and follow-
up was associated with initiation of the alternative product. The
causal mediation analyses confirmed the direct effect of base-
line ever e-cigarette use on smoking initiation, and baseline ever
smoking on e-cigarette initiation, but found that e-cigarette and
smoking escalation, respectively, did not mediate these effects.
This study provides insight into the impact of e-cigarette use
on smoking and vice versa in young people; however, the find-
ings must be considered in the light of some limitations. Attrition
was high and respondents lost to follow-up differed substantial-
ly from those retained, potentially reducing generalizability to
ever smokers, ever e-cigarette users, males, older respondents,
and those with poorer school performance and greater problem
behavior.
Although this study controlled for a variety of factors previ-
ously associated with smoking and e-cigarette use to enhance
approximation of the models, there are still several factors that
were not included that may contribute to the observed associ-
ation between these products [28]. Examples may include
curiosity, sensation seeking, liking, or disliking the effects of
smoking/e-cigarettes, expectancies of smoking/e-cigarettes, mental
ill health, and use of other drugs [28]. Furthermore, there are likely
to be contributing factors that cannot be easily measured in
surveys such as biological or genetic vulnerabilities, although drug
use and parent’
s smoking and e-cigarette use may act as an in-
dicator of these. Larger sample sizes are required to enable this
substantial number of covariates to be assessed and meaning-
fully interpreted.

 Another important limitation is that this study uses the out-
comes smoking initiation and e-cigarette initiation defined as
progressing from never to ever use of each product. This is
similar to some previous studies [12–16,21,24], yet the use of
such broad measures has been criticized for providing limited
evidence of progression to any significant smoking behavior
[28,34]. However, because of low prevalence rates of monthly
or more smoking (5%) and e-cigarette use (2%) in this study’
s
sample, options for refining the measures were limited. There-
fore, although the present study found an association between
ever smoking and ever e-cigarette use, these cannot be gener-
alized to current or regular use, and it cannot be determined
whether e-cigarette experimentation leads to regular smoking.
Such questions are critical in this area of research. Surveys with
multiple waves across several years with larger sample sizes
are needed to enable higher numbers of ever and current smokers
and e-cigarette users, and further dissect the association between
the two products.

 Despite the above limitations, this study has several strengths.
It was the first to explicitly explore the association not only
between e-cigarette use at baseline and smoking initiation at
follow-up but additionally smoking at baseline and e-cigarette
initiation at follow-up. Moreover, a novel statistical approach
(causal mediation analysis [25]) was used to explore whether the
association between baseline ever e-cigarette use and smoking
initiation at follow-up was mediated by escalation of e-cigarette
use between survey waves; the same procedure was also used
to explore further the association between smoking and
e-cigarette initiation. To our knowledge this has not been done
previously. Finally, the sample was drawn from the general pop-
ulation in Great Britain using a quota sampling approach to
enhance representativeness.
The rate of ever smoking in this study was 19.9% at baseline,
which is lower than other findings in Great Britain in 2016 [5],
but could be because of those lost at follow-up being more likely
to smoke. The rate of ever e-cigarette use (11.5% at baseline) and

 findings that ever e-cigarette use was largely confined to those
who had ever smoked, with a low proportion of never smokers
having ever used e-cigarettes, was consistent with other find-
ings in Great Britain [5,35]. Furthermore, only 4% of never smokers
initiated e-cigarette use (vs. 32% of ever smokers). This sug-
gests that e-cigarettes are attracting few who have never smoked.
Furthermore, monthly or more smoking and e-cigarette use was
low, at 5% and 2%, respectively.
In the logistic regression analyses, e-cigarette escalation
between baseline and follow-up was associated with smoking
initiation, even when controlling for ever e-cigarette use; like-
wise, smoking escalation was associated with e-cigarette initiation
when controlling for ever smoking. This represents a novel con-
tribution to the literature, and further suggests the need for multi-
wave surveys to explore dynamic changes in use of both products
over time. Despite this, the causal mediation analyses, which as
discussed allow for stronger conclusions to be made regarding
observed observations, suggest that it is primarily ever use of that
product that contributes to initiation of the alternative product.
Our findings are consistent with previous studies that found
a prospective association between e-cigarette use at baseline and
smoking at follow-up [4,12–21], and also with those who found
a prospective association between smoking at baseline and
e-cigarette use at follow-up [18,24]. There are several possible
reasons for the strong and reliable association between
e-cigarettes and smoking in young people [18,28,36]. One inter-
pretation is that e-cigarettes act as a “gateway” to smoking [3,37];
however, this has been contested [28,36], and our findings suggest
that the association between e-cigarette initiation and smoking
initiation may work both ways. Certain psychological processes
(“common liabilities”) may lead to vulnerability of any drug use
[22,23]. Specifically, young people who exhibit curiosity, rebel-
liousness, and sensation-seeking may be more likely to experiment
with both smoking and e-cigarettes. Future research should
explore potential common liabilities pertaining to experimen-
tation of both products, some of which were included in this study
and others are proposed above.
Despite potential common liabilities and our findings that
e-cigarette use is associated with smoking and vice versa, there
are several important differences to consider between these prod-
ucts and the contexts in which they may be used. Among young
people, e-cigarettes, compared with conventional cigarettes, have
been described as more accessible and convenient [38,39], have
a greater capacity for continual novelty in terms of flavors and
devices [39], and are perceived as less harmful in the UK [5,39].
On the contrary, smoking is highly stigmatized in some societal
groups [40]. Indeed, some have reported that e-cigarettes appeal
to those who do not want to smoke but want to try the experi-
ence of “smoking” [38,39].
Interestingly, friend’
s e-cigarette use increased the likeli-
hood of e-cigarette initiation but reduced the likelihood of
smoking initiation in adjusted models. This first association is
unsurprising given the important role of peer influence on be-
havior. However, the protective effect of friend’
s e-cigarette use
on smoking initiation warrants further investigation.
In conclusion, this study provides further support for the as-
sociation between ever e-cigarette use and smoking initiation,
and additionally finds that ever smoking is associated with
e-cigarette initiation, among young people. Better understand-
ing of these associations will aid policy makers with their efforts
to develop an appropriate regulatory framework for both tobacco
products and e-cigarettes.
