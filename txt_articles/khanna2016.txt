Abstract
Objective: The objective of this re-
search is to identify optimal inpatient
discharge time targets to help hospitals
reduce crowding, improve patient flow
through the ED and balance staff
workload.
Methods: Fifteen months of emer-
gency and inpatient records from a
large quaternary teaching hospital
were
used
to reconstruct patient
pathways from hospital presentation
to discharge. Discrete event simula-
tion was used to assess operationally
realistic discharge scenarios on flow
performance. Main output measures
included National Emergency Access
Target (NEAT) performance (an ED
performance
metric),
time
spent
waiting for a bed, hospital length of
stay (LOS) and occupancy.
Results: Similar levels of improvement
in NEAT performance (16%), and re-
ductions in average bed occupancy
(1.5%) and inpatient bed wait time
(25%) were observed across the simu-
lation that discharged 80% patients
before 11 a.m. and one that spread
the target between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.
Individual inpatient wards returned
potential improvements in NEAT per-
formance (median 10%, interquartile
range (IQR) 7%), and reductions in
hospital LOS (median 1%, IQR 1%)
and average occupancy (median 1%,
IQR
2%)
across
the
discharge
scenarios.
Conclusions: Conventional discharge
targets like ‘80% by 11 a.m.’ and
others that spread targets across the
day to balance staff workload freed
up the equivalent of nine available
beds for incoming patient flow, signifi-
cantly reducing time spent waiting for
an inpatient bed, hospital LOS and oc-
cupancy, and delivering much needed
improvements in NEAT performance.
While different strategies and work-
load distributions may suit individual
hospital services, the study makes a
strong case for improving ‘early in the
day’ discharge timeliness to deliver
better ED flow.
Key words: bed occupancy, crowding,
discharge
planning,

medicine, hospital administration.
Introduction
Discharge timing for admitted patients
is a well-accepted bottleneck limiting
the flow of patients through the ED
and other parts of the hospital.1–4
With growing concern regarding in-
creasing overcrowding in hospitals
around the world, effecting early dis-
charge is often touted as a cure
for reducing ED overcrowding and
bed contention, and keeping hospital
occupancy below critical occupancy
levels.5–7
However, planning discharge for
a patient is a complex process that
ideally begins when a patient is ad-
mitted to hospital, and is influenced
by several key processes including
assessments,
medication
reviews,
care transition planning, the com-
pletion of checklists and discharge
documentation/communication.
Discharge peaks at hospitals typi-
cally occur in the afternoons, well
after the morning admissions peak,
resulting in resource contention and
contributing to overcrowding.3,7 In
anticipation,
hospitals
typically
implement targets requiring signifi-
cant proportions of patients to be
discharged in the morning (e.g. 11
a.m. is a popular target). Achieving
these targets helps hospitals reduce
access
block
(also
known
as
boarding), improve flow in their
EDs and keep occupancy below crit-
ical levels.7 Poor discharge planning,
poor communication and other non-
medical reasons have been credited
with being responsible for delayed
discharges.8–11 However, several in-
tervention
projects
have
demon-
strated the ability to achieve more
timely discharge.2,12–14 A contrary
view is that aiming for morning
Key findings
• Changing the timing of when
patients are discharged from
hospital can improve patient
flow – not just inpatient flow
but also ED performance.
• Similar flow performance can be
obtained spreading out discharge
across 10 a.m.–2 p.m. compared
to discharging 80% by 11 a.m.
• Simulation allows rapid assess-
ment of operational strategies
to be tested without complex
workflow changes.

 discharges is ‘a false rule’ that contrib-
utes to bottlenecks in care delivery that
further
strains
overburdened
clini-
cians15 and can be ‘gamed’ by keeping
patients for an extra night.
Discussions with clinicians sup-
port the belief that while discharge
targets relieve overcrowding stress,
they put undue pressure on staff
and increase the propensity of sub-
optimal discharge planning. While
consulted clinicians agreed with the
need for discharge timeliness targets,
they suggested that targets needed to
be spread across the day to match in-
coming demand. However, to the
best of our knowledge, there is no ev-
idence to support what the optimal
discharge timeliness targets are for a
hospital service.
This study uses simulation to iden-
tify
achievable
and
effective
dis-
charge timeliness targets to support
acute patient flow. Operationally rel-
evant discharge time scenarios were
constructed in consultation with clin-
ical collaborators and analysed using
discrete event simulation, a process
of modelling the operations of the
system as a sequence of discrete
events in time. Flow performance
metrics included patient wait times,
length of stay (LOS), occupancy and
the 4 h National Emergency Access
Target (NEAT), an ED performance
target introduced by the Australian
government in 2011.16,17 Similar tar-
gets are also used in the UK18 and
New Zealand,19 and have also been
supported by the American College
of Emergency Physicians.20
Methods
This retrospective observational study
sourced inpatient admission, ED pre-
sentation and patient transfer data
from the Royal Adelaide Hospital,
South Australia’s largest quaternary
teaching hospital with approximately
650 beds and 70000 annual ED
presentations.
Discrete event simulation, a pro-
cess used to represent and study the
behaviour and operations of a sys-
tem as a sequence of discrete events
in time, was used for the modelling.
The model was built using ARENA
simulation
software
(version
5.0)
and used emergency, inpatient and
ward transfer records for an analysis
period
of
15 months
(458 days),
from October 2011 to December
2012 (Fig. 1). These data were used
to reconstruct pathways from emer-
gency through to the inpatient wards
for each patient, and this was used as
the baseline. Selected pathways were
modified for each simulation based
on discharge timing defined by their
scenario. Other patients followed the
discharge timing specified in their
original pathway. Patients moved
through the wards indicated in their
pathway, waiting for and occupying
beds for their defined lengths of stay,
until being discharged. The perfor-
mance of the system was measured
only during the 2012 calendar year
(366 days). The last 3 months of 2011
were used as a warm-up period to es-
tablish flow to typical levels of bed oc-
cupancy. Rules were developed to
ensure consistent handling of tempo-
rary (e.g. recovery) and permanent
transfers. The developed models were
validated by tracing the movement of
randomly picked individual patients
through the elective and emergency
pathways of the model. Appendix S1
presents
validated
traces
of
one
emergency patient and one inpatient
through the simulation.
Different discharge time scenarios
(Table 1) were constructed in consul-
tation
with
clinical
collaborators.
Given that the hospital has struggled
to achieve discharging over 35% pa-
tients before 11 a.m. despite having a
60% target for that time, the chosen
scenarios were based on traditional
hospital targets (Scenario 4) and oper-
ationally
preferred
distributions
of
workload across the day (Scenarios
1, 2, 3 and 5). Some (Scenarios 6
and 7) also evaluated the impact of
modifying only the discharge timing
of patients admitted via the emergency
stream of the hospital. Each simula-
tion was evaluated on the following
performance indicators – average
bed
occupancy,
average
inpatient
LOS, average wait time for an inpa-
tient bed (for all patients and pa-
tients from ED) and the percentage
of presenting patients that left the
ED within 4 h, that is, the NEAT
performance.
The analysis also looked at these
metrics at the inpatient ward level to
identify how various wards performed
under the simulated discharge scenar-
ios. At this level, NEAT performance
was measured as the percentage of ad-
mitted patients that had spent less than
4h in the ED.

 Results
Simulating various discharge timeli-
ness targets revealed significant perfor-
mance differences when compared with
the baseline (i.e. actual pathways).
Table 2 shows change in flow perfor-
mance for each scenario. Comparable
levels of performance improvement
were observed across Scenarios 1 and
4, with both returning 16% improve-
ment in NEAT compliance, and reduc-
tions in bed occupancy and inpatient
bed wait time of 1.5% and 25%,
respectively.
Analysing the change in patient flow
performance at the inpatient ward level
revealed differences in how individual
wards responded to the simulated dis-
charge scenarios, returning over 52%
improvement in NEAT (median 10%,
interquartile range (IQR) 7%), up to
18% reduction in LOS (median 1%,
IQR 1%) and up to 9% reduction in
average occupancy (median 1%, IQR
2%) across the scenarios (compared
with baseline performance).
Given that the maximum NEAT per-
formance improvement was observed
in
Scenarios 1
and
4,
additional
performance information is provided
for these scenarios.
Figure S1 shows hourly through-
put for the baseline and for Scenar-
ios 1 and 4. The values plotted
were obtained from traces of patient
movements in the model. It is ob-
served
that
Scenario
4
is
characterised
by
a
single
pro-
nounced discharge peak with a mag-
nitude of over double the peak
discharge rate of the baseline; Sce-
nario

provides
two
less
pro-
nounced
discharge
peaks
spread
between 10 a.m. and 12 p.m.
Table 3 shows change in patient
flow performance at the inpatient
ward level for Scenarios 1 and 4. Sim-
ilar levels of improvements were
noted across both scenarios, with in-
crease in NEAT performance (median
10%, IQR 7%), and reductions in
LOS (median 1%, IQR 1%), and
average occupancy (median 1%, IQR
2%) across the discharge scenarios.
The greatest levels of improvement
was seen for the 5238 patient cohort
admitted
to
an
internal
medicine
ward with about 4% reductions in
LOS and occupancy, and over 52%
improvement in NEAT compliance
resulting
from
the
simulated
dis-
charge scenarios. Improvements for
the 380 patients cohort admitted to
the Mental Health specialty were
marginal, with only 1% improvement
in NEAT compliance resulting from
these scenarios.

 Figure 2 shows hourly bed occupancy
levels for the wards listed in Table 3. It is
observed that, for the same patient
arrival distribution, the bed occupancy
levels for Scenarios 1 and 4 are in general
lower than those for the baseline, and
drop noticeably in the few hours follow-
ing the increased discharge rates, that is,
around 10 a.m., 12 p.m. and 2 p.m. for
Scenario 1, and 11 a.m. for Scenario 4.
Discussion
A number of initiatives had been un-
dertaken at the study hospital to
achieve discharges earlier in the day
with a historical target of 60% of
discharges to be achieved by 11 a.m.
However, operationally it was felt that
matching these time targets to incoming
demand would deliver better value and
be viewed as more achievable by
clinical staff. Further, the improve-
ment initiatives were designed with-
out knowledge of how they impacted
on targets such as the discharge-
within-4h NEAT, a critical requirement
to help drive reform. Making operational
change in the clinical environment is
fraught with varying opinions, differing
practices and myths.
The evaluated scenarios were de-
signed to provide evidence around
what are efficient discharge targets
rather than historic targets. The
modelling revealed the best perfor-
mance was reported from Scenario
4, where 80% of all inpatients were
discharged by 11 a.m. Allowing for
incoming flow when it was most
needed, this scenario resulted in
reducing
average
occupancy
by
1.5%, increasing NEAT compliance
by
over
16%,
reducing
waiting
times for a bed by 25% and allowing
an additional 1% of patients to flow
through the system. Reviewing his-
torical discharge performance though
clinicians and hospital administrators
felt this target was not operationally
realistic given that this hospital had
not been able to increase 11 a.m. dis-
charge performance beyond 35% de-
spite having this target in place.
The value of this analysis comes
from demonstrating that compara-
ble levels of flow improvements
can be gained by allowing a stag-
ing of discharge targets through
the day. Discharge Scenario 1 re-
sulted
in
similar
improvement in
NEAT compliance and reduction in
waiting times while requiring 50% of
the patients to be discharged before
10 a.m., and allowing for time until
noon to reach the 80% discharged pa-
tients target. However, the poorer per-
formance of Scenarios 2 and 3 (35%
and 50% discharged prior to 11 a.m.,
respectively) reinforced the need for
significant discharges to be completed
in the first half of the day to ensure
patient flow.
The ward level analysis confirmed
suggestions that flow bottlenecks were
caused by a subset of the inpatient
wards and identified wards that needed
attention from early discharge initia-
tives, thus allowing for optimal allo-
cation of already stretched resources.

 Scenarios 6 and 7 revealed that the sig-
nificant improvements in flow came
from modifying the discharge timing
of inpatients admitted from the ED,
highlighting the need for hospitals to
address this flow bottleneck. It was
observed that patients flowing into
one of the wards (Orthopaedic, Ward
12) had a particularly poor NEAT per-
formance. On further investigation, it
was discovered that the ward had un-
dergone a change in profile from an
inpatient orthopaedic ward to an acute
surgical/medical unit around May
2012. This change was not initially
accounted for in our analysis. A later
check, tracing patient paths through
that ward, showed that the ward per-
formance changed in early June 2012
but the waiting times increased rapidly
after that. This behaviour reflected the
change in profile and provided addi-
tional validation of the accuracy of
the model.
The findings support and extend
other research in this space. Marukian
et al.13 report on a manual interven-
tion project to increase the proportion
of discharge orders before 11 a.m. In
that study, improved communication
and incentives helped nearly double
the number of pre-11 a.m. discharge
orders,
although
the
impact
on
throughput was small, and patient
LOS remained unchanged. The au-
thors stressed the need for engaging
other caregivers and optimising other
steps of the discharge process to im-
prove flow. Powell et al.4 modelled
the impact of discharging patients
1–that is, uniformly between 8 a.m.
and 4 p.m. Their findings revealed
that discharging 4 hours earlier (i.e.
11 a.m.) reduced all boarding while
discharge-by-noon and dayshift dis-
charge helped reduce ED admitted
patient
boarding
to
3 hours
and
eliminate surgical boarding. Harrison
et al.21 analysed the relationship between
occupancy and discharge rates to show
that discharge rates improved on over-
census days, demonstrating the ability
of the system to improve when needed.
Wertheimer et al.2 report on how a
staff-led
intervention
delivered
an
increase in discharges before noon
from 11% to 38% while ensuring the
readmission rate was unaffected. While
current research highlights a hospital’s
ability to improve discharge timing
performance, this study has provided
more substantive evidence that early
discharge can make an operational
difference
to
patient
flow,
parti-
cularly on the efficacy of using more
achievable targets that are spread
across the day. In addition, the simu-
lation model helps understand the
improvement delivered at an indi-
vidual ward level to further support
the
delivery
of
improvement
in
patient
flow
and
compliance
to
targets. Providing an evidence base
to why discharge improvements are
important is also a critical clinical
change tool.
This study provides evidence that
earlier in the day discharges does
make a difference to overall patient
flow in this acute hospital. It also
demonstrates that while discharging
80% of patients by 11 a.m. improves
flow (increasing NEAT compliance
and throughput by 16% and 1% re-
spectively, and reducing occupancy
and waiting times by 1.5% and
25%, respectively), similar levels of
flow improvements can be gained by
spreading discharges across the day.
Optimising discharge timing has the
potential to deliver significant im-
provements to patient flow and allevi-
ate overcrowding (in practical terms,
a reduction of 1.5% in average occu-
pancy at the study site equates to an
additional nine available beds for inpa-
tients). While different strategies and
workload
distributions
may
prove
more efficient for various health ser-
vices, this study provides the necessary
evidence base to guide the develop-
ment of such discharge strategies and
targets by hospitals. However, in do-
ing so it also makes a strong case for
sustained executive drive, improved
governance and further research to en-
sure initiatives aimed at improving dis-
charge timing do not adversely affect
discharge quality, readmission rates
and patient outcomes.
Conclusions
As the last step of in-hospital patient
flow, discharge processes regulate pa-
tient flow through the hospital. Efficient
discharge processes help reduce over-
crowding,
alleviate
bottlenecks,
and
improve patient care and satisfaction.
We have constructed simulations to ana-
lyse several time of discharge scenarios,
specifically
their
impact
on
NEAT
performance,
inpatient
occupancy,
inpatient LOS and wait times for an in-
patient bed. Our study reveals that while
maximising
the
popular
11
a.m.
discharge
target
delivers
the
best
improvements in flow, similar levels
can also be achieved by spacing out
discharge targets through the day, mak-
ing more clinical and operational sense
by allowing the service to balance their
workload
while
still
delivering
an
efficient discharge process.
While not an easy task to achieve,
the potentially reduced wait times
and
patient
LOS,
and
improved
NEAT compliance make a strong
case for hospital services to continue
to invest the resources and leadership
support required to deliver efficient
discharge mechanisms, while ensur-
ing the quality of discharge planning
is not compromised.
Limitations
The analysis period spans 15months
and one site. Further, while perfor-
mance metrics reported in the study
focused
on
a
patient’s
immediate
hospitalisation, potential readmission
is also an important parameter to con-
sider. Such models require identifiable
data, which were not available in this
study. The modelling used current ad-
ministrative data and is reliant on the
reliability and quality of the data entry
processes. Finally, the patient flow
changes
suggested
have
not
been
operationalised and are based on sim-
ulations only. Consequently changes
to patient and staff outcomes are an-
ticipated only and have not been di-
rectly measured.
