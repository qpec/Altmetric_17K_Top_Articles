Abstract
Background
Smartphones are increasingly integrated into everyday life, but frequency of use has not
yet been objectively measured and compared to demographics, health information, and in
particular, sleep quality.
Aims
The aim of this study was to characterize smartphone use by measuring screen-time
directly, determine factors that are associated with increased screen-time, and to test the
hypothesis that increased screen-time is associated with poor sleep.
Methods
We performed a cross-sectional analysis in a subset of 653 participants enrolled in the
Health eHeart Study, an internet-based longitudinal cohort study open to any interested
adult (� 18 years). Smartphone screen-time (the number of minutes in each hour the
screen was on) was measured continuously via smartphone application. For each partici-
pant, total and average screen-time were computed over 30-day windows. Average
screen-time specifically during self-reported bedtime hours and sleeping period was also
computed. Demographics, medical information, and sleep habits (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
Index–PSQI) were obtained by survey. Linear regression was used to obtain effect
estimates.
Results
Total screen-time over 30 days was a median 38.4 hours (IQR 21.4 to 61.3) and average
screen-time over 30 days was a median 3.7 minutes per hour (IQR 2.2 to 5.5). Younger
age, self-reported race/ethnicity of Black and "Other" were associated with longer average

 screen-time after adjustment for potential confounders. Longer average screen-time was
associated with shorter sleep duration and worse sleep-efficiency. Longer average screen-
times during bedtime and the sleeping period were associated with poor sleep quality,
decreased sleep efficiency, and longer sleep onset latency.
Conclusions
These findings on actual smartphone screen-time build upon prior work based on self-
report and confirm that adults spend a substantial amount of time using their smartphones.
Screen-time differs across age and race, but is similar across socio-economic strata sug-
gesting that cultural factors may drive smartphone use. Screen-time is associated with
poor sleep. These findings cannot support conclusions on causation. Effect-cause remains
a possibility: poor sleep may lead to increased screen-time. However, exposure to smart-
phone screens, particularly around bedtime, may negatively impact sleep.
Introduction
Smartphones are increasingly integrated into everyday life [1]. At the same time, the prevalence
of insomnia and sleep deprivation have risen [2]. Poor sleep (too little or too much, and poor
quality) has been shown to be a risk factor for obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depres-
sion, and overall mortality [3,4]. Light in the blue spectrum,such as light produced from a
smartphone, can suppress production of melatonin, leading to decreased drowsiness, difficulty
initiating sleep, and non-restorative sleep [5,6]. In addition, engrossing activities during smart-
phone use may result in stimulation that is counter-productive to sleep preparation. Limiting
the use of TV and computers near bedtime is commonly recommended as an important part of
good sleep hygiene [7], but direct measurements of “screen-time” in native (or home) environ-
ments have not previously been available.
We sought to leverage data from the Health eHeart Study to (1) characterize the average
amount and distribution of smartphone screen-time measured directly in a national cohort, (2)
identify factors associated with increased screen-time, and (3) test the a priori hypothesis that
increased screen-time is associated with decreased sleep quality.
Methods
Study Design
The Health eHeart Study (www.health-eheartstudy.org) is an internet-basedprospective cohort
that began enrolling any interested adult age � 18 years with an active email address on March
8th, 2013. Participants were recruited via online and social media advertisements, email cam-
paigns with research and advocacy organizations, and directly in person at University of Cali-
fornia, San Francisco medical clinics. Consent was obtained electronically through the study
website. We initially performed comparisons between prospectively collected screen-time and
baseline demographics, medical history, and health behaviors in a hypothesis free manner. We
then focused on participants who had completed a baseline sleep survey to specificallytest the
hypothesis that more screen-time would be associated with reduced sleep quality. The study
was approved by the University of California, San Francisco Committee on Human Research.

 Measurement of Smartphone Screen-time
On September 1, 2014, participants with smartphones were invited to download a mobile
application (“app”) developed by Ginger.io (San Francisco, CA); this mobile app was capable
of recording screen-time on Android-based smartphones. Once downloaded, the app automat-
ically operated in the background without disrupting normal use of the smartphone. The app
recorded screen-time continuously as the number of minutes in each hour that the screen was
turned on as long as the smartphone was not in “airplane mode” and the app was not actively
turned off. This screen-time measure was stored locally on the smartphone and transmitted
over the Internet to the study database daily.
Screen-time data was collected on existing and new participants between September 1, 2014
and September 30, 2015. The amount of missing data (due to phone-off, airplane mode, or
app-off)in 30-day rolling windows was computed and the windows with the minimum level of
missing data were identified and selected for analysis. In the event of ties, the earliest window
with the minimum amount of missing data for each participant was selected for analysis. Par-
ticipants with no screen-time data (100% missing data) or less than 30 days of observation
were excluded. Within the selected 30-day window, the overall average screen-time (averaged
over all hours in 30 days) and the hourly average screen-time (during each hour of the day,
averaged over 30 days) were computed for each participant.
Ascertainment of Demographic and Medical Information
Participants provided baseline personal, demographic, and medical information via several
online surveys once during their initial “eVisit.” Race and ethnicity were combined into a sin-
gle mutually exclusive covariate (“race/ethnicity”), where Hispanic ethnicity, if present, took
precedence over selected race. Self-reported height and weight were used to calculate body
mass index (BMI). The validated Patient Health Questionnaire Overview(PHQ-9) was used
to assess mood [8]. The validated International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was
used to assess physical activity [9]. The validated Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was
used to assess sleep duration, quality, and the sleeping period (bedtime and wake-up time)
[10,11]. The total PSQI score and component sub-scores were analyzed as continuous vari-
ables and “poor sleep” was defined as dichotomous variable by PSQI total > 5, per instru-
ment protocol [12].
Statistical Analyses
Continuous variables with a normal distribution are presented as means ± standard deviations
(SDs) and were compared with student’s t-tests. Non-normally distributed continuous vari-
ables are presented as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) and were compared with the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Categorical variables are presented as counts and percentages of the
population and were compared with chi-squared tests.
Associations between average screen-time and baseline demographics, medical history, and
behaviors were assessed first in a bivariate manner using linear regression models. Variables
that were associated with average screen-time with two-tailed p < 0.10 in the bivariate analyses
were retained in a single multivariate linear regression model where significance was consid-
ered at the standard two-tailed p < 0.05 level. Variables that remained statistically significantly
associated with screen-time in the multivariate model were interpreted as independent predic-
tors of screen-time. Variables that were no longer associated with screen-time in the multivari-
able model were considered to have been confounded by other variables, and were interpreted
as not being key independent predictors. A sensitivity analysis was performed by restricting to
those with complete screen-time data (no missing data) over the 30-day window.

 Hypothesis-driven analyses related to screen-time and sleep were restricted to participants
that completed the PSQI. Age, sex, and a history of sleep apnea were a priori “forced” into
adjusted linear regression models along with other covariates that were significant (p<0.05) in
the hypothesis-free multivariate model. Based on a priori hypotheses, select measures from the
PSQI were compared to the average screen-time in the hours near self-reported bedtime (1
hour before participant-reported bedtime, the hour of participant-reported bedtime, 1 hour
after the participant-reported bedtime) and during the sleep period (bedtime hour to wake-up
hour) in a subgroup with no missing screen data. Statistical analyses were performed using
STATA 13 (College Station, TX). Two tailed p values <0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
Results
Participants
Among 23,187 Health eHeart participants enrolled by September 1, 2015, there were 3,566 that
had downloaded the Ginger.io app of which 761 had Android-based phones that enabled cap-
ture of screen-time. Of these, 653 completed the core surveys in eVisit 1, had the app down-
loaded for at least 30 days, and had at least some (i.e., not 100% missing) screen-time data.
Participants represented all 50 U.S. states and 147 (23%) resided in California (Fig 1). The base-
line characteristics of the study population are presented in Table 1. Those with an average
screen-time above the population median tended to be younger, female, Black, Hispanic, or
“other” race/ethnicity, and have a higher PHQ-9 depression score. A sensitivity analyses
restricted to a subgroup with 0% missing screen data (n = 292) revealed similar results (data
not shown).
Within the selected 30-day windows, the app recorded screen-time for a median 29.9 (IQR
27.3 to 30.0) days, during which total screen-time was a median 38.4 (IQR 21.4 to 61.3) hours
and average screen-time was a median 3.7 (IQR 2.2 to 5.5) minutes per hour. This average

 screen-time is equivalent to 1 hour and 29 minutes (IQR 53 minutes to 2 hours and 12 min-
utes) per day. The relative distribution of screen-time within participants and hourly average
screen-time across the population are shown in Fig 2.
Associations with Screen-Time
In pursuing the hypothesis-free approach to identify predictors of screen-time, crude analyses
revealed that younger participants, females, blacks, Hispanics, those self-reporting as “other”
race, those of lower socioeconomicstatus (less education and lower income), those without a
past history of smoking, those with a higher PHQ-9 score (more depressed mood), and those
without atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, or hypertension exhibited a longer overall average
screen-time (Fig 3). After multivariate adjustment, only younger participants, blacks, and those
reported to be of an “other” race demonstrated statistically significantly longer average screen-
times (Fig 3). For instance, an individual 10 years older in age, on average after multivariable
adjustment, had an average overall screen-time that was lesser by 0.7 minutes/hour (95% confi-
dence interval 0.5 to 0.8, p < 0.001).
Screen-Time and Sleep
In the hypothesis-driven analyses in the subgroup who also completed the sleep survey
(n = 136), decreased sleep quality, shorter sleep duration, lower sleep efficiency, and longer
sleep onset latency were each significantly associated with greater overall average screen-time

 in unadjusted analyses (Fig 4). After adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and history of
sleep apnea, a greater score on the PSQI sleep duration component (less sleep) and reduced
sleep efficiencywere each statistically significantly associated with longer average screen-time
(Fig 4).
There were 56 participants that both completed the PSQI sleep survey and had complete
screen-time data (0% missing). After adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and sleep
apnea, poor sleep (by PSQI total > 5) was statistically significantly associated with longer
average screen-time during the reported sleeping period and during the hour after bedtime
(Fig 5). Both decreased sleep efficiency and increased sleep onset latency were associated
with longer average screen-time during the reported sleeping period, the hour of bedtime,
and the hour after bedtime. Total sleep duration was not associated with average screen-
time during the reported sleeping period or during any of the 3 hours near reported
bedtime.

 Discussion
Participants' smartphone screen-time exposure was on average approximately 3.7 minutes per
hour, centered as expected primarily during the daytime. Those who were younger, Black, and
Other race/ethnicity had greater screen-time exposure. Longer average screen-time was associ-
ated with shorter duration of sleep and reduced sleep efficiency. Given that screen-time after
self-reported sleeping hours and near an individual’s bedtime was associated with reduced
sleep efficiencyand greater sleep onset latency, the relationship between overall smartphone
use and sleep may be driven by exposure near bedtime.
Since the advent of the modern smartphone in 2007, the adoption and use of these devices
has been rapid and widespread [13]. As of 2015, approximately 64% of all American adults
owned a smartphone, including 85% of those aged 18 to 29 [1]. While the demographics of
individuals that purchase smartphones has been studied, the frequency of use based upon an
objective measure has not previously been described.We found that younger individuals on
average have greater screen-time, in agreement with survey-baseddemographic and marketing
research [1,13]. Our finding that African Americans and Hispanics exhibit longer screen-time
is consistent with the fact that racial and ethnic minorities have fewer desktop and laptop com-
puters at home and are more frequently dependent on their smartphone for internet access [1].
Of interest, neither income nor education was associated with average screen-time after multi-
variable adjustment, suggesting that something cultural aside from socio-economicstatus may
be driving increased smartphone use in these populations.
While there has been concern for both the negative and positive impact of smartphones on
depression [14,15], screen-time exposure was not associated with mood after multivariable
adjustment. It is also noteworthy that unlike TV watching [16,17], smartphone screen-time
was not associated with physical activity level or BMI. This may in part be due to the multi-
functionality of smartphones, different modes of media consumption, or perhaps the use of
smartphones during physical activities (i.e., running apps). Finally, despite the fact that search-
ing for medical information is one of the most common activities carried out with smartphones
[1], none of the medical conditions evaluated were associated with average screen-time.
In addition to how smartphones are changing modern life, the impact of screen exposure on
sleep is a major concern. Poor sleep has been shown to decrease performance at school and
work, is associated with depressed mood, and is established as a risk factor for obesity, cardio-
vascular disease, stroke, and death [4,18,19]. Smartphones are often nearby at night, and 68%
of owners store their phone on a bedside table while they sleep [20]. Prior studies regarding
watching television, conventional computer use, and video-games have demonstrated that use
at nighttime and particularly in the bedroom is associated with poor sleep and insomnia [2,7].
Exposure to blue light from such backlit screens suppresses production of melatonin, thereby
delaying sleep onset and reducing sleep duration and quality [21]. A recent randomized cross-
over trail found hospitalized patients took longer to fall asleep and had reduced quality of sleep
after reading a backlit eReader compared to a paper book before bedtime [22]. However, this
and other experimental studies may not generalize to typical at-home screen exposure and
experiences with eReaders may not extrapolate to smartphone use. At-home screen-time
obtained by self-report has been associated with poor sleep [23], but a study that used an app
to measure smartphone screen-time in a small group of Taiwanese university students found
that participants underestimated their screen-time by approximately 9 hours per week (equiva-
lent to an average of 3.2 minutes/hour) [24].
Our objectively measured screen-time was associated with reduced quality of sleep. That
increased screen-time in the hour of and after bedtime, but not the hour before, was associated

 with greater sleep onset latency agrees with the notion that screen use just before attempting to
fall asleep may be particularly problematic.
This study has several important limitations. First, we analyzed a self-selectedgroup of par-
ticipants that elected to enroll in the Health eHeart Study and download the Ginger.io app,
which may not be representative of the general population. Compared to the U.S. census, the
cohort is better educated, wealthier, and consists of a greater proportion of whites and females
[25,26]. The relative older age of our cohort may be surprising in a study requiring smartphone
ownership. However, as demonstrated by the standard deviations in age, the cohort generally
represented those in their early 30s to those in their mid 60s. This likely demonstrates the age
groups most representative not only of smartphone ownership, but also those most willing,
interested, and able to engage with an internet-based research study. On the other hand, we
could only record screen-time on Android phones, owners of which tend to have lower socio-
economic status compared to iPhone owners [27,28]. Similarly, analyses on screen-time and
sleep were limited to a subset who had both types of data available, and analyses on screen-
time near bedtime were in a further subset with no missing screen-time data, both of which are
susceptible to selection bias. Demographic, medical, and sleep information were obtained by
self-report, although well-validated standardized scales (PSQI, PHQ-9, IPAQ) were used. In
addition, self-report of medical conditions within the Health eHeart Study has previously
proven to exhibit high accuracy [29]. App-recorded screen-time is subject to some measure-
ment error. Screen-timewhen the app was actively turned off or the phone was in airplane
mode was not captured, there could be multiple users of a single smartphone, or the screen
could be on while a participant was not aware (such as when the screen is on while in a pocket).
We also focused specificallyon smartphone screen-time exposure and did not have informa-
tion on the use of other back-lit devices (TV, computer, tablets). We analyzed 30-day windows
with the least amount of missing screen data in an attempt to maximize the accuracy of the
screen-time measure, but this could also have induced bias. Still, incomplete capture of smart-
phone screen exposure, and the absence of data on exposure to other types of screens, should
only decrease sensitivity for associations with other participant characteristics. Finally, in
regards to the analyses related to screen-time and sleep; although screen-time was collected
prospectively and compared to sleep characteristics at baseline, we cannot exclude “effect-
cause”—poor sleep could lead to more screen-time.
Our study also has some notable strengths. This is the first time smartphone screen-time
exposure has been recorded prospectively and compared to demographic and medical infor-
mation. Screen-timewas measured unobtrusively during “at home” use over a 30 day period
and thus is more comparable to every-day long term use than prior experimental studies. Fur-
thermore, since enrollment and consent in the Health eHeart study is performed remotely, the
cohort is not limited to a particular geographic location or clinical population.
Our findings suggest that smartphone screen-time is an important exposure associated with
worse sleep. Since poor sleep has important health consequences, further investigation to deter-
mine the causal relationship between smartphone use and sleep is necessary. This study took
advantage of an app to measure smartphone screen-time, but sleep habits were measured once
via a survey. Future work may benefit from using an app to collect data on nightly sleep quality.
A measure of overall screen-time from multiple devices would also be helpful in this regard.
Since certain activities may be more stimulating (e.g. thumbing through Facebook posts),
future work might explore how screen-time, smartphone activities, and sleep interact. Ulti-
mately, a deeper understanding of the situational and cultural factors driving smartphone use
will be needed to guide studies on interventions aimed at reducing screen-time to improve
sleep.

 Conclusions
Our findings demonstrate that we spend a substantial portion of our time looking at our smart-
phones. Screen-timediffers across age, race, and ethnicity and may be culturally driven by dif-
ferent norms or other environmental determinants. Screen-time exposure varies throughout
the day, with most exposure occurringduring the day, but some individuals have peaks of use
during the night. Exposure to a smartphone screen, particularly around bedtime, is associated
with a lower quality of sleep.
