Abstract 
Rationale: Platelets are increasingly recognized as mediators of tumor growth and metastasis. 
Hypothesizing that activated platelets in the tumor microenvironment provide a targeting epitope for 
tumor-directed chemotherapy, we developed an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), comprised of a 
single-chain antibody (scFv) against the platelet integrin GPIIb/IIIa (scFvGPIIb/IIIa) linked to the potent 
chemotherapeutic microtubule inhibitor, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). 
Methods: We developed an ADC comprised of three components: 1) A scFv which specifically binds to 
the high affinity, activated integrin GPIIb/IIIa on activated platelets. 2) A highly potent microtubule 
inhibitor, monomethyl auristatin E. 3) A drug activation/release mechanism using a linker cleavable by 
cathepsin B, which we demonstrate to be abundant in the tumor microenvironment. The 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE was first conjugated with Cyanine7 for in vivo imaging. The therapeutic efficacy of the 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE was then tested in a mouse metastasis model of triple negative breast cancer. 
Results: In vitro studies confirmed that this ADC specifically binds to activated GPIIb/IIIa, and cathepsin 
B-mediated drug release/activation resulted in tumor cytotoxicity. In vivo fluorescence imaging 
demonstrated that the newly generated ADC localized to primary tumors and metastases in a mouse 
xenograft model of triple negative breast cancer, a difficult to treat tumor for which a selective 
tumor-targeting therapy remains to be clinically established. Importantly, we demonstrated that the 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE displays marked efficacy as an anti-cancer agent, reducing tumor growth and preventing 
metastatic disease, without any discernible toxic effects.  
Conclusion: Here, we demonstrate the utility of a novel ADC that targets a potent cytotoxic drug to 
activated platelets and specifically releases the cytotoxic agent within the confines of the tumor. This 
unique targeting mechanism, specific to the tumor microenvironment, holds promise as a novel 
therapeutic approach for the treatment of a broad range of primary tumors and metastatic disease, 
particularly for tumors that lack specific molecular epitopes for drug targeting.

Introduction 
The mainstay of treatment for many cancers 
remains systemic chemotherapy. However, this 
approach is associated with inevitable ‘off target’ 
effects of chemotherapy, resulting in systemic toxicity 
due to the limited selectivity for tumor cells. Recently, 
antibody-directed chemotherapy has offered a very 
promising approach to overcome these inherent 
limitations of systemic chemotherapy by leveraging 
the targeting capability of antibodies towards 
tumor-specific antigens or proteins for the delivery of 
chemotherapy 
[1]. 
Consequently, 
antibody-drug 
conjugates (ADC) provide the means to deliver high 
local concentrations of chemotherapy specifically to 
the tumor whilst avoiding systemic toxicity [2]. The 
efficacy of ADCs has been demonstrated by the 
success of trastuzumab emtansine for HER-2 positive 
breast cancer and brentuximab vedotin in anaplastic 
large cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma [3,4], 
and holds promise in malignancies with limited 
prognosis such as glioblastoma [5].  
The efficacy of ADCs is highly contingent upon 
the expression and abundance of a specific target 
epitope on the cancer cells. However, this represents a 
major limitation for the use of ADCs since in several 
cancer types, such as triple negative breast cancer, 
specific molecular targets are lacking or are yet to be 
determined [6,7]. Here, we develop a unique strategy 
to overcome this limitation by targeting a specific 
component of the tumor microenvironment, as 
opposed to a molecular epitope unique to a specific 
cancer cell. There is growing evidence demonstrating 
an intimate relationship between platelets and cancer, 
and the abundance of activated platelets in the 
microenvironment of a range of tumors [8–10] 
including ovarian cancer [11], colorectal cancer [12] 
and oesophageal cancer [13]. In this regard, platelets 
express an abundant and specific surface epitope, the 
integrin 
glycoprotein 
(GP)IIb/IIIa 
(αIIbß3; 
CD41/CD61). Importantly, on circulating platelets 
this integrin exhibits an ‘unactivated’ or low affinity 
conformation. In contrast, upon platelet activation, 
GPIIb/IIIa undergoes a confirmation change such that 
it adopts a high affinity conformation for ligand 
binding [14]. Indeed, we recently provided proof of 
concept that the high affinity conformation of 
GPIIb/IIIa on activated platelets can serve as a 
molecular 
targeting 
epitope 
for 
the 
tumor 
microenvironment in several types of cancers in mice 
and humans [15]. Therefore, targeting activated 
platelets in the tumor microenvironment, using a 
highly abundant and specific epitope, represents a 
novel approach for the targeted delivery of tumor 
directed chemotherapy.  
Here, we describe the generation of a unique 
ADC, scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE, that targets platelets in the 
microenvironment of tumors as a novel approach for 
cancer treatment. This ADC is based on three major 
components: 1) The targeting scFv (scFvGPIIb/IIIa), 
which selectively binds to an epitope that is cryptic on 
the low-affinity GPIIb/IIIa on circulating platelets but 
becomes exposed on the high affinity GPIIb/IIIa, 
expressed on activated platelets [16,17]. 2) A synthetic 
microtubule inhibitor, monomethyl auristatin E 
(MMAE), which is an ideal drug for targeting by 
utilizing its high cytotoxic potency and obviating its 
otherwise dominant non-specific cell toxicity. 3) A 
cancer-specific, 
Valine-citrulline 
(Val-Cit) 
linker, 
utilizing the abundance of cathepsin B in the tumor 
microenvironment for cleavage and release of the 
active MMAE, thereby locally releasing cytotoxic 
effects [18,19].  
To demonstrate the functionality of our novel 
anti-cancer ADC, with its unique activated platelet 
targeting, we 
first 
confirmed 
the 
efficacy of 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE for tumor killing in human cell 
lines of triple negative breast cancer, colorectal cancer, 
fibrosarcoma and prostate cancer. Next, we used a 
triple negative breast cancer metastasis model for 
proof of concept in vivo studies. Treatment of mice 
with scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE resulted in significant 
regression 
of 
primary 
tumors 
and 
prevented 
metastasis without systemic side effects. Together, 
these findings indicate the generation of a promising 
ADC and establishes a unique concept that holds 
promise as a novel, potentially broadly applicable 
anti-cancer therapy, which is of relevance for both 
difficult to treat tumors and those with limited 
specific target epitopes.  
Materials and Methods 
Study Approval  
All animal studies were conducted in strict 
accordance with protocols approved by the Alfred 
Medical Research Education Precinct Animal Ethics 
Committee and the Monash University Animal Ethics 
Committee. 
Generation of targeting scFv-LPETG and 
coupling enzyme sortase A 
The generation of the scFvGPIIb/IIIa and a control, 
non-binding, scFv (scFvmut) has been described 
previously [20]. Using polymerase chain reaction, 
an LPETG-tag (sortase A recognition sequence), a 
V5-tag and a His-tag were introduced to the 
C-terminal end of the scFv [21]. The entire scFv was 
then subcloned into a pSectag 2A vector (Invitrogen, 
Carlsbad, CA, United States) for expression in human 
  Theranostics 2019, Vol. 9, Issue 4

1156 
embryonic kidney (HEK) cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, 
CA, United States) [22]. Sortase A was used to induce 
an enzymatic reaction for the conjugation of the scFv, 
carrying an LPETG sequence to MMAE which was 
produced incorporating a triple glycine sequence. 
Sortase A, a transpeptidase cloned from Staphylococcus 
aureus was produced and purified as previously 
described [23]. All proteins (scFvs and sortase A) 
contain a 6x His-tag, which was used for purification 
with 
nickel-based 
affinity 
chromatography 
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States). 
Conjugation of scFv with MMAE and Cy7 
MMAE, carrying a Val-Cit linker and a triple 
glycine sequence (GGG-Val-Cit-PAB-MMAE) was 
synthesized by Levena Biopharma (San Diego, CA, 
United States). The scFvGPIIb/IIIa and scFvmut (each 
constructed with a LPETG-tag) were linked to 
GGG-Val-Cit-PAB-MMAE 
using 
a 
sortase 
A 
enzyme-based 
protocol 
to 
produce 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE and scFvmut-MMAE, as described 
previously [21]. Excess scFv which contains a His-tag 
was removed using metal affinity chromatography 
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States) and excess 
MMAE was removed using a 10 kDa spin column. For 
imaging studies, Cy7 was incorporated into the 
conjugate by incubating scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE and 
scFvmut-MMAE with 2x excess Cy7 via amine labeling 
(AAT Bioquest, Sunnyvale, CA, United States). Excess 
free dye was removed by dialysis in PBS. The purified 
scFv-Cy7-MMAE was analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel and 
the protein and near-infrared signal from the band of 
interest was confirmed using the Odyssey Imager 
(Licor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, United States). 
Additionally, Western blot was performed with rabbit 
anti-MMAE antibody (Levena Biopharma, San Diego, 
CA, United States), detected with an HRP-anti-rabbit 
antibody (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, United States) 
to confirm conjugation of MMAE to the scFv. 
Preparation of platelet rich plasma and flow 
cytometry  
Blood was collected from healthy volunteers in 
citrate and centrifuged at 180 g for 10 minutes. The 
platelet rich plasma was then collected, stored at 37°C 
and used within two hours. For flow cytometry, 
platelet rich plasma was diluted 1:20 in Tyrode’s 
buffer. To induce platelet activation, ADP was added 
at a final concentration of 20 μM for 5 minutes before 
adding the scFv. Binding was determined by 
anti-V5-FITC (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, 
United States) or rabbit anti-MMAE antibody (Levena 
Biopharma, San Diego, CA, United States) and 
detected with an anti-rabbit mAb coupled to AF647 
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States). Flow 
cytometry was performed using a FACS Fortessa 
scanner (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, United 
States). Results were analyzed using the Flowlogic 
software.  
To determine the ability of cancer cells to 
activate platelets, platelet rich plasma was incubated 
with the cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, HT29, 
HT1080 and PC3 for 6 hours at 37°C. As a positive 
control 
with 
the 
same 
experimental 
setting, 
ADP-activated platelet rich plasma was incubated 
with the cancer cells for 6 hours at 37°C. The cancer 
cell and platelet (resting/ADP-activated platelets) 
mixtures were then stained with an anti-CD41-PE 
monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, 
NJ, United States) and scFvGPIIb/IIIa or scFvmut binding 
was detected by an anti-V5-FITC monoclonal 
antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom). 
Flow cytometry and analysis was performed as 
described above.  
Cancer cell lines 
A metastatic variant of the MDA-MB-231 
triple-negative breast adenocarcinoma cell line (a kind 
gift from Dr Zhou Ou, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer 
Center, China) was transduced with a lentiviral vector 
containing 
codon-optimized 
firefly 
luciferase- 
mCherry under the control of the ubiquitin-C 
promoter [24,25] and was cultured in DMEM medium 
+ Glutamax (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, United 
States), 
supplemented 
with 
10% 
(v/v) 
FBS 
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States), at 37°C in a 
5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Human cancer cell 
lines HT29, HT1080 and PC3 were cultured in RPMI 
media (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, United 
States) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 100 U/mL 
penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin at 37°C in a 
5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Cell identity was 
confirmed by karyotyping.  
Cytotoxicity assays 
The cytotoxic activity of GGG-Val-Cit-PAB- 
MMAE and scFv-MMAE were assessed in a 
cytotoxicity assay in the presence of cathepsin B. To 
induce cathepsin B cleavage, MMAE, GGG-Val-Cit- 
PAB-MMAE or scFv-MMAE were incubated with 0.01 
units of pre-activated cathepsin B (Sigma Aldrich, St 
Louis, MO, United States) for 4 hours at 37°C in 25 
mM acetate buffer pH 4.8. MDA-MB-231, HT29, 
HT1080 and PC3 cells were seeded on a 96 well plate 
at 6000 cells/well overnight. The next day, cells were 
treated with MMAE, GGG-Val-Cit-PAB-MMAE or 
scFv-MMAE in the presence or absence of cathepsin B 
and incubated for 72 hours. Metabolism of the yellow 
tetrazolium salt (XTT) was determined according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma Aldrich, St 
  Theranostics 2019, Vol. 9, Issue 4 
 
 
http://www.thno.org 
1157 
Louis, MO, United States). Percentage killing relative 
to untreated control cultures was calculated using the 
following formula: 100 - [(test value/untreated value) 
x100]. Each assay was repeated in triplicate. 
For platelet assays, 100 µL of platelet rich plasma 
(containing approximately 
2x107 
platelets) 
was 
activated with 20 µM ADP. Activated platelets were 
incubated with scFv-MMAE for 30 minutes. To 
remove unbound scFv-MMAE, the platelet-scFv- 
MMAE mixture was centrifuged at 2000 g for 2 
minutes, the supernatant was removed, and platelets 
were resuspended in PBS. As a control, unwashed 
platelet-scFv-MMAE 
mixture 
was 
used. 
Either 
washed or unwashed (control) platelet-scFv-MMAE 
mixture was added to MDA-MB-231, HT29, HT1080 
and PC3 cells in the absence of exogenous cathepsin B 
and incubated for 72 hours before determination of 
XTT metabolism as described above. 
Immunohistochemical analysis of cathepsin B 
in tumors 
Tumors were fixed in formalin solution (Sigma 
Aldrich, St Louis, MO, United States) for 24 hours, 
paraffin embedded, and microtome sectioned (Leica, 
Wetzlar, Germany) to 5 µm – 30 µm onto a glass slide. 
Sections were deparaffinized and underwent antigen 
retrieval with 0.01 M Citric Acid in 90°C for 20 
minutes. Tumor sections were stained overnight with 
an anti-cathepsin B antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, 
United Kingdom) and detected with an Alexa Fluor 
488 labeled anti-mouse antibody (Life Technologies, 
Carlsbad, CA, United States) and cell surface 
membrane-reactive anti-sodium/potassium ATPase 
antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), 
counterstained 
with 
Hoechst® 
(ThermoFisher 
Scientific, 
Waltham, 
MA, 
United 
States) 
and 
visualized using the A1r Plus Confocal Microscope 
(Nikon,  
Shinagawa, Tokyo 
, Japan), 20x water 
objective.  
Breast cancer metastasis model 
To establish metastasis, 2 × 105 MDA-MB-231 
cells in 20 μL PBS were injected into the fourth left 
mammary fat pad of 5-6 weeks old anaesthetized 
BALB/C athymic nude mice. Primary tumor growth 
was measured by caliper and tumor volume was 
determined using the formula (length × width2)/2. 
Additionally, primary tumor growth was measured 
via bioluminescence using the IVIS Lumina II (Perkin 
Elmer, Waltham, MA, United States) imaging system 
by measuring luciferase activity after a tail-vein 
injection of 150 mg/kg D-luciferin (ThermoFisher 
Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). Metastasis 
development was monitored via bioluminescence 
using IVIS Lumina II by measuring luciferase activity 
in the chest region, distant from the primary tumor, 
for a longer time point (60 sec) as previously 
described 
[25]. 
Metastasis 
development 
was 
quantified using the Living Image software v4.5.1 
(Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, United States) by 
quantifying photon/s in a region of interest around 
the chest bioluminescence signal.  
For 
therapy 
studies, 
mice 
underwent 
bioluminescence imaging on day 3 and day 7 post 
tumor inoculation to confirm tumor growth. Mice 
with tumors were then randomly assigned to three 
groups and treated with either scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE, 
scFvmut-MMAE or left untreated. Treatment was 
initiated 7 days following tumor inoculation, via 
intravenous injection of 6 mg/kg body weight of 
either scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE or scFvmut-MMAE followed 
by three additional treatments every fourth day. 
Primary tumor size and metastasis development was 
monitored twice a week as described above.  
In vivo fluorescence imaging of 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa-Cy7-MMAE 
Animals were injected intravenously with 20 µg 
of scFvGPIIb/IIIa-Cy7-MMAE or scFvmut-Cy7-MMAE. 
Fluorescence imaging of the ADC in mice was 
performed 24 hours later using the IVIS Lumina using 
the following settings (Filter Passband = Excitation 
710-760 nm, Emission 810-875 nm). Following 
imaging, mice were sacrificed, organs perfused to 
remove circulating blood and reimaged.  
Flow cytometry and ex vivo fluorescence 
imaging of scFvGPIIb/IIIa-GFP and GP1bβ 
BALB/C 
nude 
mice 
with 
MDA-MB-231 
mammary tumor, or non-tumor bearing mice were 
injected intravenously with 20 µg of scFvGPIIb/IIIa-GFP 
or scFvmut-GFP and 20 µL of DyLight 649 anti-GP1bβ 
(Emfret 
Analytics, 
Eibelstadt, Bayern, Germany). 
After 24 hours, animals were sacrificed, and tumor, 
spleen and femurs were extracted.  
Tumor samples were fixed in formalin (Sigma 
Aldrich, St Louis, MO, United States) for 24 hours, 
paraffin embedded, and microtome sectioned (Leica, 
Wetzlar, Germany) to 20 µm onto a glass slide. 
Sections were deparaffinized, stained with Hoechst® 
and visualized using the A1r Plus Confocal 
Microscope using a 60x oil objective.  
For flow cytometry, spleen sections were teased 
apart, disaggregated and filtered through a 100 µm 
filter into single cell suspensions. Bone marrow cells 
were extracted from the femurs and filtered through a 
100 µm filter into single cell suspensions. Spleen and 
bone marrow cells were then suspended in 1 mL red 
cell lysis buffer (0.155 M NH4Cl, 0.01 M KHCO3, 0.01 
mM EDTA) for 10 min and neutralized with wash

buffer (PBS, 2mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA). Cells were 
stained with mouse CD41-PE (eBioscience, Waltham, 
MA, United States) and flow cytometry was 
performed using the Fortessa scanner. Results were 
analyzed using the Flowlogic software.  
Mouse blood collection and toxicity 
measurements  
Mouse blood was collected via submandibular 
bleeds into EDTA-coated microtainer collection tubes 
(BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, United States) 
and blood counts were performed using the XS-1000i 
hematologic analyzer (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, 
Hyogo, Japan) to determine white blood cells (WBC) 
and platelets counts. For liver and kidney function 
tests, 500 µL of mouse blood was collected in citrate. 
Plasma was collected following centrifugation of 
blood at 1000 g for 10 minutes and alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
and urea levels were measured using the Synchron 
LX20PRO System (Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, 
High Wycombe, United Kingdom) by Monash 
Pathology.  
Statistical analyses 
All data are reported as mean ± SEM of at least 3 
independent assays unless otherwise noted. Statistical 
analyses were performed using unpaired Student’s T 
tests for comparison of two groups. Statistical 
analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA, 
with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test for analysis 
of metastasis volume and two-way ANOVA, with 
Tukey’s multiple comparisons test for analysis of 
primary tumor growth volume. A P value of < 0.05 
was considered significant. 
Results 
ScFvGPIIb/IIIa-Cy7-MMAE binds to activated 
platelets 
To allow the unique targeting of a potent 
anti-mitotic agent to activated platelets, we developed 
a novel antibody-drug conjugate combining several 
advanced biotechnological tools and methods. We 
utilized a unique scFvGPIIb/IIIa, which specifically 
targets activated platelets, combined with a sortase A 
based site-directed biological conjugation method to 
produce 
a 
novel 
ADC, 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE 
incorporating the potent anti-mitotic agent (MMAE). 
In order to facilitate its conjugation to the scFv and 
enzymatic release, a MMAE linker was designed with 
a triglycine (GGG) sequence, a cathepsin B cleavable 
peptide (Val-Cit) and a para-aminobenzylalcohol 
(PABA) self-immolative spacer (Figure 1). Each scFv 
has a sortase A recognition sequence, LPETG, at the 
C-terminus used for a site-directed, enzymatic

scFvGPIIb/IIIa was conjugated to GGG-Val-Cit-PAB-MMAE using an enzymatic sortase A reaction, (B) followed by Cy7 conjugation, via NHS labelling to produce 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa-Cy7-MMAE. (C) In vivo, cathepsin B cleaves the scFvGPIIb/IIIa-Cy7-MMAE at the MMAE Val-Cit linker, releasing the potent MMAE for tumor killing.

coupling to the glycine sequence of GGG-Val-Cit- 
PAB-MMAE. To enable in vivo detection, the 
scFv-MMAE was labeled with a Cy7 dye by NHS 
labeling to yield, scFvGPIIb/IIIa-Cy7-MMAE (Figure 1). 
Analysis of this final construct using SDS page 
electrophoresis and visualized using the Odyssey 
reader confirmed successful Cy7 labeling of the scFv 
which has a molecular weight of 34 kDa (Figure 2A). 
The 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa 
carries 
a 
hexahistidine 
tag 
downstream of the LPETG sequence, which is cleaved 
following sortase A reaction, resulting in a final 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa-Cy7-MMAE 
product 
with 
reduced 
molecular weight compared to the uncleaved 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa. MMAE conjugation to the scFv was 
analyzed via Western blotting using an anti-MMAE 
antibody and confirmed by the presence of a band at 
~33 kDa (Figure 2B). Additionally, flow cytometry 
experiments demonstrated that specific binding of the 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa-Cy7-MMAE 
construct 
to 
activated 
platelets was maintained post conjugation (Figure 
2C). The scFvGPIIb/IIIa used in this study binds to only 
the activated form of platelet-specific GPIIb/IIIa, 
importantly both in human, as well as in mouse 
platelets. As a negative control, we used an scFvmut, 
which we have previously developed with a point 
mutation, such that it acts as a non-binding control 
(Figure 2D) [16].  
Cathepsin B cleaves scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE and 
scFvmut-MMAE to its potent and cytotoxic 
form 
Next, we assessed the cytotoxic activity of 
MMAE on tumor cells in culture after the drug was 
released from the ADC by exogenous cathepsin B and 
confirmed equal dose-dependent killing of the 
triple-negative breast adenocarcinoma cell line 
MDA-MB-231 by scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE and scFvmut– 
MMAE. 
On 
MDA-MB-231 
cells, 
the 
IC50 
of 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa–MMAE was 1.98x10-10 M while the IC50 of 
the scFvmut–MMAE was 1.78x10-10 M (Figure 3A). 
These studies confirmed that our approach of 
utilizing a sortase A conjugation of MMAE to the scFv 
allowed for a controlled and equal coupling of MMAE 
to the scFv and the equivalent cathepsin B-mediated 
release of cytotoxic MMAE by scFvGPIIb/IIIa and scFvmut. 
The incorporation of a cathepsin B cleavable 
linker enables the activation of an inactive prodrug to 
an active cytotoxic form by utilizing the abundance of 
cathepsin B in the tumor microenvironment [26]. Prior 
to animal studies, in vitro studies were performed to 
demonstrate that the scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE is released 
and 
maintains 
cytotoxicity 
upon 
exposure 
to 
cathepsin B. MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with 
either 
MMAE, 
GGG-Val-Cit-PAB-MMAE 
or 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE in the absence and presence of 
cathepsin 
B. 
The 
IC50 
killing 
efficacy 
of 
GGG-Val-Cit-PAB-MMAE on MDA-MB-231 tumor 
cells was 1.86x10-8 M and the addition of cathepsin B 
increased 
the 
cellular 
killing 
efficacy 
by 
approximately 40-fold to 4.70x10-10 M (Figure 3B), 
which is similar to the IC50 of the unmodified MMAE. 
The IC50 killing efficacy of scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE was 
2.21x10-8 M and the addition of cathepsin B enhanced 
the killing efficacy to 1.96x10-10 M (Figure 3B). We

presence of cathepsin B, indicating release of MMAE. 
We also observed a lower level (~10-8 M) of 
non-specific killing of cancer cells with scFv-MMAE 
and GGG-Val-Cit-PAB-MMAE in the absence of 
exogenous Cathepsin B. We expect this to be due to 
the secretion of small amounts of cathepsin B from the 
cancer cells, or release of other cathepsins and 
proteases that can also cleave the Val-Cit linker, as 
previously reported [27–29]. These findings confirm 
the cytotoxic potency and the efficacy of the cathepsin 
B dependent release and activation of the potent 
MMAE from its inactive form in the newly created 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE. 
To investigate if the therapeutic efficacy of 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE is based on its specificity for 
activated 
platelets, 
the 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE 
or 
scFvmut-MMAE was incubated with ADP-stimulated 
platelets in vitro. Platelets were subsequently washed 
to 
remove 
unbound 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE 
or 
scFvmut-MMAE and then added to MDA-MB-231 cells 
(Figure 3C). Consistent with the specific binding of 
the targeted ADC to activated GPIIb/IIIa, incubation 
of 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa–MMAE 
with 
activated 
platelets 
resulted in increased MDA-MB-231 cell killing, with 
an IC50 of 5.9x10-9 M. In contrast, activated platelets 
incubated with scFvmut-MMAE demonstrated no 
cellular killing. As a control to confirm the equal

undergo washing, were added to MDA-MB-231 
tumor cells (Figure 3C). No significant differences in 
killing were observed between the scFvGPIIb/IIIa– 
MMAE and scFvmut–MMAE. The IC50 killing efficacy 
of scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE on MDA-MB-231 was 1.27x10-8 
M and the IC50 killing efficacy of scFvmut–MMAE on 
MDA-MB-231 was 1.38x10-8 M, thereby confirming 
equal coupling efficacy of MMAE to both, scFvGPIIb/IIIa 
and scFvmut. 
To examine whether our novel ADC displays 
efficacy 
against 
different 
tumor 
types, 
these 
experiments were repeated using a human colorectal 
cell line (HT29), a human fibrosarcoma cell line 
(HT1080) and a human prostate cancer cell line (PC3). 
We first demonstrated that MDA-MB-231, HT29, 
HT1080 and PC3 tumor cells cultured in GGG-Val-Cit 
PAB-MMAE and scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE, in the presence 
of cathepsin B were able to induce cellular killing, 
albeit 
at 
slightly 
varying 
concentrations 
(Supplementary Figure 1A). Next, HT29, HT1080 and 
PC3 cell lines were cultured in ADP-activated 
platelets 
mixed 
with 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE 
and 
scFvmut-MMAE (Supplementary Figure 1B). These 
studies confirmed that the scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE bound 
to activated platelets and induced cell killing of the 
HT29, HT1080 and PC3 cell lines, thus supporting the 
notion that this platelet-targeted ADC is active across 
a broad range of tumor cell types.  
In this study, we introduce a novel approach of 
utilizing 
Val-Cit-PAB-MMAE, 
a 
cathepsin 
B 
dependent prodrug, conjugated to a scFv that targets 
activated platelets as a component of the tumor 
microenvironment. Previous studies have indicated 
the abundance of secreted or cell surface-associated 
cathepsin B within tumor cells [30,31]. To confirm the 
suitability of the platelet-targeting approach for 
therapeutic application, we investigated the presence 
and localization of cathepsin B within the tumor via 
immunofluorescence imaging of tumor xenograft 
sections stained with a cathepsin B antibody. 
Immunostaining confirmed the presence of cathepsin 
B within MDA-MB-231 tumor cells and the tumor 
microenvironment (Figure 3D). To ascertain the 
cellular localization of cathepsin B in tumor cells, a 
magnified image was acquired (Figure 3E). This 
confirms the intracellular and pericellular location 
(indicated by white arrows) of cathepsin B within 
tumor cells.  
Cancer cells induce platelet activation and can 
be imaged using scFvGPIIb/IIIa-Cy7-MMAE 
The ability of cancer cells to activate platelets 
and the functionality of the scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE to 
target 
activated 
platelets 
in 
the 
tumor 
microenvironment was first analyzed in vitro via 
fluorescence imaging. MDA-MB-231, HT29, HT1080 
and PC3 cells were incubated with washed human 
platelets and stained with anti-CD41 antibody as a 
platelet marker and scFvGPIIb/IIIa, as a platelet 
activation marker. Strikingly, flow cytometry analysis 
of the platelet population (as defined by CD41 
expression) revealed that incubation of platelets with 
MDA-MB-231, HT29, HT1080 or PC3 tumor cells 
resulted in activation of the entire platelet population, 
to a similar extent as ADP-activated platelets, thus 
confirming the ability of scFvGPIIb/IIIa to detect tumor 
cell-induced platelet activation (Figure 4A and 4B, red 
line). In contrast, scFvmut, as negative control, showed 
no binding to platelets incubated with cancer cells 
(Figure 4B, blue line). Furthermore, gating on the 
cancer cell population confirmed that platelets bind 
directly to cancer cells, to varying degrees, depending 
on the cell line (Figure 4A and 4C). Indeed, the 
percentage of MDA-MB-231, HT29, HT1080 and PC3 
cells with adherent platelets were 10%, 15%, 44% and 
11%, respectively (Figure 4C). To further illustrate the 
platelet-cancer 
cell 
interactions, 
we 
performed 
immunofluorescence imaging, demonstrating that 
platelets can bind directly to cancer cells and that 
cancer cells induce platelet activation, which can be 
detected 
by 
binding 
of 
the 
activation-specific 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa (Figure 4D). 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa-Cy7-MMAE localizes to activated 
platelets in the tumor microenvironment and 
sites of metastasis 
For in vivo characterization, scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE 
and scFvmut-MMAE were conjugated to Cy7 and 
injected intravenously to mice with MDA-MB-231 
primary tumor that had already metastasized. 
Fluorescence imaging of mice performed 24 hours 
post injection of scFv-Cy7-MMAE demonstrated 
enrichment of scFvGPIIb/IIIa-Cy7-MMAE at the primary 
tumor region, with no tumor localization of the 
scFvmut-Cy7-MMAE 
(Figure 
5A). 
As 
the 
MDA-MB-231 cells had been previously transduced 
with a lentiviral vector to express luciferase, 
bioluminescence imaging was used to detect areas of 
primary tumor as shown in Figure 5B. Concordant 
with in vivo imaging, ex vivo analyses showed 
significant enrichment of scFvGPIIb/IIIa-Cy7-MMAE but 
not scFvmut-Cy7-MMAE in the primary tumors 
(Figure 5C and 5D). Bioluminescence imaging of lung 
and lymph node metastases was performed by 
covering the primary tumor site and imaging with a 
longer exposure time (60 sec) (Figure 5E and 5F). We 
further 
demonstrated 
that 
the 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa- 
Cy7-MMAE localized in the lungs of MDA-MB-231 
tumor-bearing mice with lung metastases (Figure 5E), 
but not in mice without lung metastases (Figure 5F), 
  Theranostics 2019, Vol. 9, Issue 4 
 
 
http://www.thno.org 
1162 
confirming that scFvGPIIb/IIIa-Cy7-MMAE localization 
was specific to activated platelets within tumors. 
Again, no tumor localization of the scFvmut-Cy7 
-MMAE was observed in the lungs in the presence or 
absence of metastases (Figure 5E and 5F).  
scFvGPIIb/IIIa localizes to activated platelets in 
the tumor microenvironment but not to 
resting platelets in the spleen and bone 
marrow 
To further confirm the selectivity of the targeted 
ADC for platelets in the tumor microenvironment in 
vivo, MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice were injected 
with scFvGPIIb/IIIa-GFP or scFvmut-GFP and a Dylight 
649 anti-GP1bβ antibody. This in vivo approach for 
immunofluorescence was used as the activated form 
of GPIIb/IIIa undergoes a conformational change and 
antigen masking upon tissue fixation and is not 
recognized by the scFvGPIIb/IIIa. After 24 hours, tumors 
were 
extracted, 
sectioned 
and 
imaged 
using 
fluorescence 
microscopy 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
localization of platelets, detected by GP1bβ staining 
co-localizing with activated platelets, as indicated by 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa-GFP in the tumor microenvironment 
(Figure 6A). In contrast, we saw no GFP signal in mice 
injected with scFvmut-GFP (Figure 6B), indicating the 
specificity of the scFvGPIIb/IIIa targeting to activated 
platelets. 
 
Figure 4. Tumor cells induce platelet activation. (A) Washed platelet rich plasma was added to MDA-MB-231, HT29, HT1080 and PC3 tumor cells and stained with a 
PE-conjugated anti-CD41 antibody and scFvGPIIb/IIIa or scFvmut, detected with an anti-V5-FITC antibody. Flow cytometry dot plots represent the gating strategy differentiating 
regions of cancer cells and platelets. The cancer cell region was further gated to select for CD41-positive cancer cells (CD41+ve). (B) Analysis of the CD41-positive region 
demonstrated that 100% of platelets were activated upon incubation with cancer cells for 6 hours, determined by positive scFvGPIIb/IIIa binding (red), which was equivalent to 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa binding to ADP-activated platelets (green). As a negative control, platelets incubated with cancer cells were also stained with scFvmut (blue) and displayed negative 
binding (all n=3). (C) Analysis of the region of cancer cells positive for CD41 (red), confirming that platelets can bind directly to cancer cells (all n=3). (D) Fluorescence imaging

staining.

To demonstrate the specificity of the scFvGPIIb/IIIa 
to activated platelets in the tumor microenvironment, 
we next investigated whether the scFv localized to the 
spleen and bone marrow, which are two abundant 
sources of non-activated platelets. BALB/C nude mice 
were injected with scFvGPIIb/IIIa-GFP or scFvmut-GFP 
and the Dylight 649 anti-GP1bβ antibody and the 
femurs and spleen were extracted after 24 hours and 
stained for CD41. Single cell analysis via flow 
cytometry of the spleen and bone marrow, gated on 
CD41-positive 
cells 
displayed 
binding 
of 
the 
GP1bβ antibody in the spleen and bone marrow but 
no scFvGPIIb/IIIa binding to these regions (Figure 6C 
and 6D), thus confirming the specificity of scFvGPIIb/IIIa 
for activated platelets in vivo.  
Treatment with scFvGPIIb/IIIa-Cy7-MMAE 
reduces tumor growth and metastasis 
To investigate the in vivo effect of the 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE 
therapeutic, 
MDA-MB-231 
metastatic tumor-bearing mice were imaged for 
bioluminescence signal at day 3 post MDA-MB-231 
inoculation, and again at day 7 to confirm the 
presence of growing tumors (Figure 7A). Mice with 
established tumors were then divided into three 
groups and treated with scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE or 
scFvmut-MMAE, or left untreated, and the effect of 
therapy on tumor growth and metastasis formation 
was assessed. Strikingly, treatment of tumor-bearing 
mice with scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE at a dose of 6 mg/kg 
(administered every 4 days) resulted in a marked 
reduction in the primary tumor size by over 70% as 
compared to mice treated with scFvmut-MMAE or 
mice in the untreated group (Figure 7B). Accordingly, 
a significant reduction in the development of lung and 
lymph node metastases on day 23, as measured by 
total 
bioluminescence, 
was 
seen 
in 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE 
treated 
mice 
compared 
to 
non-targeted and vehicle controls (Figure 7C). 
Significantly, treatment with scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE 
prevented the development of metastasis in 40% of 
mice 
(3 
out 
of 
7 
mice), 
as 
indicated 
by 
bioluminescence imaging, while all mice in the 
untreated group or treated with scFvmut-MMAE 
developed metastases. Importantly, no therapeutic 
effects were observed with scFvmut-MMAE, thus 
highlighting the impressive ability of our targeting 
approach to concentrate therapeutic doses of MMAE 
specifically within the tumor and to prevent 
metastases. Consistent with our data demonstrating 
  Theranostics 2019, Vol. 9, Issue 4 
 
 
http://www.thno.org 
1164 
the high degree of specificity of scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE 
for activated platelets, we did not observe any 
off-target side effects in treated mice. Mice were 
healthy during the course of the treatment, did not 
lose weight (Supplementary Figure 2A), and 
hematological parameters, liver function and renal 
function were within normal ranges (Supplementary 
Figure 
2B). 
Taken 
together, 
these 
findings 
demonstrate the potential of therapeutic targeting of 
activated platelets as a strategy for the delivery of 
chemotherapy to maximize potency and potentially 
minimize systemic side effects. 
Discussion 
In this study we demonstrate the utility of 
targeting activated platelets within the tumor 
microenvironment as a novel strategy for the 
treatment of primary tumors and prevention of 
metastatic disease. This approach is based on the 
development of a unique ADC, which targets 
tumor-associated 
platelets 
using 
the 
activated 
GPIIb/IIIa as an epitope for localized delivery of 
MMAE, a potent synthetic anti-mitotic agent. 
Importantly, this novel approach allows for the 
controlled-release of MMAE, via tumor-derived 
cathepsin B, sparing the undesirable systemic side 
effects 
commonly 
seen 
with 
traditional 
chemotherapy. 
The efficacy of an ADC is highly contingent 
upon the presence and abundance of a specific 
molecular target on tumor cells. This is a major 
limitation for the use of ADCs, as many cancer types 
do not express a clinically validated antigenic 
molecular target. In this regard, a particular 
advantage of our approach is the possible ubiquitous 
nature of activated platelets in a broad range of 
 
Figure 6. Activated platelets are present in the tumor microenvironment but absent in the spleen and bone marrow. (A, B) Immunofluorescence imaging of

human tumors, including breast [32], colorectal [33], 
lung [34], ovarian [11] and esophageal [13] tumors, 
indicating that our platelet-targeting strategy holds 
promise for a large range of tumors. 
Additionally, we show the ability to target the 
tumor stroma as a novel approach to deliver a 
pro-drug 
for 
the 
killing 
of 
tumor 
cells. 
Valine-citrulline (Val-Cit), a cathepsin B cleavable 
linker requires the presence of cathepsin B for 
cleavage and release of free MMAE, the active 
anti-cancer agent. The protease cathepsin B is tightly 
regulated in healthy tissues. However, it is well 
established that cathepsin B is overexpressed in tumor 
cells [30,31]. Moreover, tumor cells, as well as cells in 
the tumor microenvironment, such as stromal 
fibroblasts and macrophages, can secrete cathepsin B, 
resulting in the accumulation of cathepsin B within 
the 
tumor 
microenvironment 
[31,35–37]. 
There 
remains some debate regarding the role of cathepsin B 
in regulating tumor biology given it has been 
demonstrated to facilitate tumor progression and 
metastasis [38], and promote tumor apoptosis [39,40]. 
Nevertheless, it is well established that cathepsin B is 
highly expressed in the tumor microenvironment 
[30,31,38]. Therefore, incorporating a cathepsin B 
cleavable linker, which allows for the specific release 
of the potent cytotoxic MMAE at the tumor site, 
represents a major advantage of our ADC design. 
Therapeutic approaches using ADCs, such as 
MMAE are commonly used to target antigens 
expressed on cancer cells. The binding of the ADC to 
the tumor cell is typically followed by internalization 
of the ADC and release of the cytotoxic drug [38,41]. 
However, studies by Dal Corso et al, have also 
demonstrated the functionality of ADCs with 
cathepsin B-cleavable linkers, which are coupled to an 
antibody with a specificity to non-internalizing 
targets in the tumor microenvironment [42,43]. Our 
study 
further 
illustrates 
that 
tumor-specific 
cytotoxicity can be achieved by targeting a platelet 
surface epitope using scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE, conjugated 
via a Val-Cit linker. A similarly elegant and successful 
targeting approach for MMAE to the tumor 
microenvironment was recently reported by Li F et al.,

who used the antigen-unspecific Fc-FcγR interaction 
to 
deliver 
a 
MMAE-conjugated 
ADC 
to 
tumor-associated macrophages, also resulting in the 
release of MMAE in the tumor environment [44]. Our 
approach demonstrates an alternative mechanism for 
targeting the tumor microenvironment as the scFv 
does not possess an Fc region. Nevertheless, both 
selective 
deliveries 
of 
MMAE 
to 
the 
tumor 
microenvironment 
represent 
novel 
promising 
anti-cancer approaches. 
Previous studies have confirmed that cathepsin 
B can be transported to the extracellular surface 
(pericellular expression), leading to its secretion into 
the microenvironment as well as being associated 
with the cell surface [45,46]. This concept has recently 
been further supported by Kramer L et al., who 
demonstrated that tumors could be imaged using a 
cell impermeable Cathepsin B-specific DARPin 
labelled with Cy5.5, thus highlighting the abundance 
of membrane associated/secreted cathepsin B in the 
tumor microenvironment in vivo [47]. Furthermore, 
the secreted cathepsin B is made up of the “active” 
Cathepsin B (in contrast to the precursor form of 
cathepsin B, known as pro-cathepsin B) [48]. This 
“active” cathepsin B is required for cleavage of the 
Val-Cit linker, resulting in the release of the active and 
highly potent cytotoxic drug into the extracellular 
space [49,50]. Based on these findings, we postulate 
that scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE is cleaved and activated by 
cathepsin B in the extracellular space. An alternative 
possibility is that the uncleaved ADC could be taken 
up by tumor cells, and the cytotoxic MMAE released 
by intracellular cathepsin B. The exact tumor cell 
killing mechanism remains to be investigated in 
future detailed studies. 
Whilst many ADCs have utilized whole 
antibodies, we chose to use a scFv as an antibody 
format, since it offers several significant advantages. 
The small size allows quick and efficient penetration 
of the scFv based ADC to the tumor environment, 
whilst ensuring quick clearance of the scFv from 
non-affected tissues. The recombinant nature of 
production 
offers 
flexibility 
with 
respect 
to 
modification of the scFv and the incorporation of 
additional tags, such as the LPETG sequence which 
we have used in the sortase A conjugation method 
[45]. Furthermore, the scFvGPIIb/IIIa possesses two 
additional advantages for clinical translation. Firstly, 
the scFvGPIIb/IIIa was developed from a human scFv 
library, reducing the risk of antigenicity. Second, the 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa is cross reactive between mice and human 
GPIIb/IIIa, and therefore binds with similar affinity to 
activated platelets from both species [16].  
Our data suggests that this newly designed ADC 
has the capability to target and efficiently kill a broad 
range of tumor cells in vitro. Therefore, future studies 
will be aimed at investigating the efficacy of 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE across different tumor types in 
vivo. In addition, whilst tumors can display or acquire 
resistance mechanisms to MMAE, a major advantage 
of our scFv platform is the ability to conjugate the 
scFv with different cytotoxic drugs, thus providing 
versatility in both the range of tumors that can be 
targeted, and the cytotoxic payload to be delivered. 
Whilst our preliminary safety studies demonstrated 
no 
off-target 
toxicity 
associated 
with 
the 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE, it is important to note that mice 
are approximately 3 to 6 times less sensitive to the 
toxic effects of MMAE compared to humans [46]. 
Thus, studies to examine for signs of systemic toxicity 
in other species, which share a similar MTD to 
humans, such as rats and cynomolgus monkeys, will 
be important for clinical translation. In general, 
further systematic toxicity studies would need to be 
undertaken prior to any potential clinical study. 
Cancer associated thrombosis is one of the major 
causes of mortality in cancer patients. It is therefore 
common for cancer patients to be treated with 
anti-thrombotics [47]. As such, another important 
aspect for clinical translation relates to the question of 
whether the concurrent use of anti-thrombotic drugs 
impacts on the therapeutic efficacy of our ADC. 
Indeed, the use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors during 
anti-cancer therapy might reduce the effective binding 
of 
the 
GPIIb/IIIa 
targeting 
ADC. 
However, 
GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor therapy is only used, albeit 
infrequently, in the acute setting of percutaneous 
coronary intervention [14]. In addition, GPIIb/IIIa 
inhibitors are associated with a high bleeding risk and 
would frequently be contraindicated in patients with 
active cancer [48]. Nevertheless, cancer patients might 
receive treatment with aspirin or P2Y12 inhibitors. 
Although platelet function is partially inhibited with 
these drugs, they do not fully prevent the 
conformational change of the GPIIb/IIIa receptor [49], 
which exposes the targeting epitope of our ADC. 
Furthermore, given the multiple mechanisms by 
which tumors can activate platelets, and the high 
abundance of GPIIb/IIIa receptor on platelets, the 
ADC targeting epitope should still be present in high 
abundance following aspirin or P2Y12 therapy. 
Interestingly, anticoagulants such as heparin, have 
been demonstrated to increase cathepsin B activity 
[50], which could potentiate the effect of this ADC 
therapy. Overall, we expect that the described 
activated platelet targeting therapeutic approach will 
maintain efficacy in the presence of anti-thrombotic 
drugs. 
However, 
the 
issue 
of 
concomitant 
anti-thrombotic 
therapies 
requires

investigation during the clinical development of 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE.  
Moreover, the ability of the scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE 
to act as an imaging agent to detect activated platelets 
within tumors is an advantage in the context of 
concurrent treatment modalities that could affect 
platelet activation, and to identify various tumor 
types with abundant platelets as a predictor of 
treatment response. Therefore, as part of developing a 
personalized medicine approach, patients could first 
be imaged with a specific imaging version of 
scFvGPIIb/IIIa, e.g. which is coupled to a PET/MRI 
contrast agent, allowing the sensitive detection of 
tumors and metastases. Upon confirming the 
presence of activated platelets within tumors, patients 
could then be treated with scFvGPIIb/IIIa conjugated to 
the cytotoxic drug. This personalized theranostic 
approach is a particularly attractive capability of our 
activated-platelet targeting strategy.  
In conclusion, we introduce a novel approach for 
the safe and effective delivery of anti-cancer therapy, 
within the tumor microenvironment, by targeting 
activated platelets. We designed and successfully 
tested a novel antibody-drug conjugate incorporating 
a scFv targeting activated GPIIb/IIIa and an 
additional 
selective 
drug 
activation/release 
mechanism via cathepsin B, for the delivery of the 
cytotoxic agent, monomethyl auristatin E specifically 
to the tumor site. Addressing a major clinical need, we 
provide proof of concept of the therapeutic efficacy of 
our novel ADC in treating both primary tumor and 
preventing metastasis using a murine model of the 
difficult to treat triple negative breast cancer. 
Moreover, we have previously established the ability 
of the activated platelet-specific scFv for imaging a 
broad range of tumors [15] which raises the prospect 
of an integrated approach for cancer diagnosis and 
therapy, by utilizing molecular imaging as a means to 
detect tumor-associated platelets, and therefore 
predict those likely to respond to platelet-targeted 
therapy. Together, these findings demonstrate the 
broad 
potential 
of 
our 
unique 
activated 
platelet-targeting approach as a novel theranostic 
anti-cancer strategy, especially for cancers that do not 
express specific molecular epitopes suitable for 
therapeutic targeting.
