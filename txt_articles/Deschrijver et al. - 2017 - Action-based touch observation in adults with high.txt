Abstract
Next to social problems, individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often report severe sensory difficulties. Altered
processing of touch is however a stronger mediator of social symptoms’ severity than altered processing of for instance
vision or audition. Why is this the case? We reasoned that sensory difficulties may be linked to social problems in ASD
through insufficient self-other distinction centred on touch. We investigated by means of EEG whether the brain of adults
with ASD adequately signals when a tactile consequence of an observed action does not match own touch, as compared to
the brain of matched controls. We employed the action-based somatosensory congruency paradigm. Participants observed
a human or wooden hand touching a surface, combined with a tap-like tactile sensation that either matched or mismatched
the tactile consequence of the observed movement. The ASD group showed a diminished congruency effect for human
hands only in the P3-complex, suggesting difficulties with signalling observed action-based touch of others that does not
match own touch experiences. Crucially, this effect reliably correlated with self-reported social and sensory everyday diffi-
culties in ASD. The findings might denote a novel theoretical link between sensory and social impairments in the autism
spectrum.

Introduction
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental con-
dition characterized by, amongst others, persistent difficulties
in
social
communication
and
social
interaction
(DSM-5;
American Psychiatric Association, 2013). This is often reflected
in a reduced knowledge of others’ state of mind (Baron-Cohen
et al., 1985) and an egocentric bias within the normal reciprocity
of social interactions (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
Apart from social impairments, people with ASD often show
sensory abnormalities in their daily life. For instance, feelings of
sensory overload and other hypersensitivities are repeatedly re-
ported (for reviews see Donohue et al., 2012; Iarocci and
McDonald, 2006; Marco et al., 2011) and sensory problems have
recently been formally included in the diagnostic criteria of ASD
in the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). For this
reason, an increasing number of researchers consider compro-
mised sensory processing an essential aspect of ASD, and have
tried to link it conceptually to social impairments (Pellicano and
Burr, 2012; van Boxtel and Lu, 2013; Van De Cruys et al., 2014).

 More specifically, it was suggested that social difficulties in ASD
might merely result from the sensory complexity inherent to
social situations, leading to attempts to avoid these overstimu-
lating situations (Simmons et al., 2009; Van De Cruys et al., 2014).
Importantly, altered processing of tactile information is
more strongly related to social symptoms’ severity than altered
processing of distal senses such as vision and audition (Hilton
et al., 2010; Lundqvist, 2015). But why is this the case? Why does
touch seem to be so strongly related to social symptoms of
ASD? We think that this may have to do with the important role
of tactile information when distinguishing between self and
other (Deschrijver et al., 2015). Recently, it has been argued that
self-other distinction plays a crucial role in social cognition be-
cause one crucial requirement of almost all social abilities is to
distinguish between self and other (Brass et al., 2009; Paladino
et al., 2010; Spengler et al., 2010; Spengler et al., 2009). Self-other
distinction based on distal senses, however, proves quite diffi-
cult. What I see when I am moving my hand for instance, is rela-
tively similar to what I see when someone else is moving his/
her hand. This is however not the case for the sense of touch:
when I feel touch when moving my hand (e.g. when grasping a
glass), this tactile experience is completely different to what I
feel when another person is performing the same movement,
as only in the former case my skin is involved.
This is noteworthy, because research has shown that we do
involve our own touch-processing systems to simulate tactile
experiences of others (Keysers et al., 2004; Gazzola and Keysers,
2009; Keysers et al., 2010). When we observe an action, we simu-
late the tactile consequences of this action in our somatosen-
sory cortices (next: action-based touch simulation; Gazzola and
Keysers, 2009; Keysers et al., 2010). This suggests that while
interacting with others, we are ‘feeling’ what others feel while
they are acting (Keysers et al., 2004; Gazzola and Keysers, 2009;
Keysers et al., 2010). However, as outlined earlier, the experience
arising from these simulated touch representations of others
does not quite resemble feeling own touch. Moreover, the simu-
lated touch mostly does not readily correspond to one’s experi-
ence of own touch at any given time. One could consequently
reason that detecting the mismatch between felt touch and
simulated other-related touch could be useful to distinguish
self from other when one is observing action-based touch: If the
visual movement that I am seeing is produced by me, I should
feel corresponding tactile feedback. If I detect own touch that is
incongruent, instead, someone else must have produced the
movement. Interestingly, previous research has shown already
that comparing simulated touch to felt touch crucially contrib-
utes to the neural representation of the self as similar or distinct
of its environment (Tsakiris and Fotopoulou, 2008; Paladino
et al., 2010; Tsakiris, 2010; Ionta et al., 2011; Blanke, 2012;
Deschrijver et al., 2015 ). The sense of touch might thus be of
paramount importance for understanding that tactile conse-
quences of an observed hand action are other-related, more so
than distal senses such as vision and audition. Impaired ability
to signal simulated touch of others that does not match own
touch, in contrast, might result in severe impairments in both
the representation of self and others (Lombardo and Baron-
Cohen, 2010, 2011). In sum, we reasoned that insights into the
neural interplay of observed touch and felt touch in individuals
with ASD may prove crucial for our understanding of both social
and sensory aspects of the disorder.
Recently we developed and validated a paradigm to investi-
gate the interaction of felt touch and observed action-based
touch (the action-based somatosensory congruency paradigm) and
tested it in neurotypical adults using electroencephalography
(EEG) measures (Deschrijver et al., 2015). In this paradigm, pic-
ture sequences of human and wooden hands touching a sur-
face with the index or middle finger are presented, while
simultaneously applying a ‘tap-like’ tactile stimulation to the
corresponding or non-corresponding finger of the participant.
Using EEG, we observed effects at early low-level stages of
somatosensory processing (sensory evoked potentials; SEPs
P50, N100 and N140, see also Deschrijver et al., 2015; Popovich
and Staines, 2015) as well as at high-level stages of processing
(P3-complex comprising an early centro-parietal P3-compo-
nent and a later more posterior parietal P3 component, e.g.
Verleger et al., 2005). Previous research in the field of social
neuroscience has associated the P3-component with self ver-
sus other-related processes (for a review, see Knyazev, 2013).
Studies have for instance reported amplified P3 components
for hearing one’s own name or seeing one’s own face (as com-
pared to hearing/seeing another (familiar) person’s name/
face (Perrin et al., 2005; Holeckova et al., 2006; Tacikowski and
Nowicka, 2010; Tacikowski et al., 2011; Cygan et al., 2014;
Tacikowski et al., 2014 ), for touch experienced by another
body that is congruent to own touch (Longo et al., 2012;
Deschrijver et al., 2015), and for observed actions that are
compatible to own (intended) actions (de la Asuncion et al.,
2015; Ruissen and de Bruijn, 2015). We therefore reasoned in
our earlier study that a P3-effect in the current paradigm
might reflect self-other distinction centred on touch proc-
esses (Deschrijver et al., 2015). The findings revealed that par-
ticipants process a tactile stimulus differently depending on
whether the sensation matches or mismatches an observed
human hand’s finger tap. As predicted, we observed a congru-
ency effect for human hands only in the P3, suggesting that
the neurotypical human brain signals simulated action-based
touch that does not match felt touch at high-levels of
processing.
In the current work, we aimed to evaluate this process in a
group of adults with high functioning autism (HFA), while com-
paring their EEG responses to those of a neurotypical control
group (CON). We hypothesized that individuals with ASD might
experience difficulties in signalling human action-based touch
that does not match own felt touch, indicated by a reduced P3
effect, as a reflection of deficient self-other distinction based on
touch processes. Such a finding would suggest that representa-
tions of the tactile consequences of an observed other’s actions
may not be identified as other-related in the brain of individuals
with ASD. Furthermore, we hypothesized that such a problem
might be rooted in sensory difficulties related to the spectrum
and, in turn, may be associated with social difficulties by affect-
ing how individuals with ASD represent one’s self as well as
others. We therefore additionally hypothesized that the P3 ef-
fect might correlate with self-report measures of social autistic
difficulties and of sensory hypersensitivity/avoidance at an in-
dividual level in the HFA group. Such findings would help to
understand the relation of sensory and social difficulties in the
autism spectrum.

 IQ-score points), gender and handedness (as measured by the
Edinburgh Handedness Inventory; Oldfield, 1971). Participants
in the CON group were screened on several exclusion criteria
prior to participation (neurological, psychiatric, sensory or
motoric problems and the use of psychiatric medication). All
participants with HFA had received a formal diagnosis of ASD
(including autism, Asperger’s syndrome and PDD-NOS) from an
independent clinician or multidisciplinary team and were free
of any additional neurological disorder. They completed the
Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule (ADOS; Lord et al.,
2000) Module 4 with a trained researcher. The local Ghent
University ethics committee approved the study. All partici-
pants were financially compensated for their participation and
gave written informed consent before participation.
Similar to previous studies on HFA (Magne
´e et al., 2008;
Zwickel et al., 2011), we included in our data analyses HFA par-
ticipants who scored above or one point below cut-off on one
subscale of the ADOS and attained an ADOS score of minimum
6. It is not uncommon for individuals with a diagnosis of ASD
that are high-functioning to score just below ADOS cut-off crite-
ria (Magne
´e et al., 2008; Zwickel et al., 2011). As such, the data of
19 pairs of participants were included in our analyses (with 14
HFA participants meeting full ADOS criteria). Two participants
from the CON group were additionally excluded from analyses,
one because artefact rejections retained less than 10% of one in-
dividual’s data and one because of displaying a P3-complex that
strongly differed from all other participants in terms of morph-
ology and topography. The remaining participant groups (CON:
n ¼ 17; HFA: n ¼ 19), were well matched for gender (CON: 11
males; HFA: 13 males), handedness (right-handed CON: 16 per-
sons; right-handed HFA: 17 persons), age (CON: M ¼ 31.35,
SD ¼ 6.63; HFA: M ¼ 32.95 years, SD ¼ 6.26), and full-scale IQ
score (CON: M ¼ 118.76, SD ¼ 14.16; HFA: M ¼ 110.95, SD ¼ 14.64).
Finally, all participants filled out self-report questionnaire
forms: the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield, 1971), the
Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ; Baron-Cohen et al., 2001), the
Social Responsiveness Scale—Adult version (SRS-A; Bo
¨lte et al.,
2008), and the Sensory Profile-NL (SP; Dunn and Westman,
1997). While the AQ is a self-report measure of general autistic
traits, the SRS-A specifically measures social difficulties charac-
teristic of the autism spectrum. The SP, on the other hand,
focuses on sensory processing peculiarities within daily life
situations,
and
yields
four
quadrant
scores
(Sensation
Hypersensitivity, Sensation Avoidance, Low Registration and
Sensation Seeking). Due to missing data, the SRS-A question-
naire data of three individuals (one from the HFA group and two
from the CON group), the AQ questionnaire data of two partici-
pants with HFA and the Sensory Profile-NL data of one individ-
ual with HFA could not be included. T-tests confirmed that no
significant demographic differences existed between groups.
Individuals in the HFA group scored well above ADOS and aut-
ism cut-offs of the AQ on average (Lord et al., 2000; Baron-Cohen
et al., 2001). As one could expect, t-tests showed highly signifi-
cant differences between the mean total dimensional scores on
the SRS-A and on the AQ questionnaires. Participant character-
istics and statistics are summarized in Table 1.
Procedure
For both groups, the EEG-experiment was the first in a larger
battery of tasks (not presented here), which took place in two
experimental sessions (with approximately 3 weeks time in be-
tween). Both sessions took place in a dimly lit and sound-
attenuated room. In the first session, the EEG-data were
gathered, with this study being the first of two EEG-studies. In
the second session, each participant completed two behavioural
tasks (not reported here) and demographic data were gathered.
If no recent standardized cognitive assessment was performed
(within 5 years prior to participation), we derived the partici-
pants’ status as ‘high functioning’ from an IQ-score estimation
using the KAUFMAN 2 short form Wechsler Adult Intelligence
Scale III (full scale IQ � 85; see Minshew et al., 2005 for the use in
ASD). After this, participants belonging to the HFA group
received the ADOS-Module 4 (Lord et al., 2000), administered by
a formally trained researcher.
Stimuli and task
All materials and the design were identical to those described in
our earlier study with the action-based congruency paradigm
(Deschrijver et al., 2015; Figure 1). All visual stimuli were 640 �
380 pixels large and were centrally presented at approximately
60 cm distance from the participant on a 17 inch monitor. We
placed the participant’s right hand in a natural palm-down pos-
ition on the table surface. A custom made tactile stimulator
(Dancer Design; www.dancerdesign.co.uk) with two independ-
ently
controlled
piezo-electric
electrodes
delivered
supra-
threshold ‘single tap’ stimuli to about 1 cm2 of the tip of the
participant’s index and middle fingers of this hand, consistent
with the location of the observed action-based touch. The fin-
gers were loosely fixed to the electrodes with tape and then cov-
ered with a dark cloth, preventing the participant from seeing
his hand. Within reach of the left hand, a keyboard was situ-
ated. Before the start of the experiment was announced, we
applied 30 tactile sensations to the index finger and an equal
amount to the middle finger of the participant, which were ran-
domly intermixed and identical to the ones used in the experi-
ment. We used an interstimulus interval of 700 ms, while
continuously showing a white fixation cross in the middle of a
black screen. Data acquisition and stimulus delivery were ac-
complished via the programme Presentation (Neurobs), ran on a
HP Compaq desktop with Windows XP driver.
In the experiment, each trial started with showing a hand in
a neutral posture from a first-person perspective, corresponding
to the participant’s own right hand (1000 ms). We then pre-
sented an index or middle finger in a tapping position (1200 ms)
and ended with a black screen (700 ms). A ‘single tap’ tactile
stimulation to the index or middle finger of the participant was
synchronized with the onset of the tapping position frame. To
achieve this, an audio file containing a single sawtooth wave-
form drove the piezzo-element of the tactile stimulator. In con-
gruent trials, the observed hand executed a finger movement
that would naturally lead to the tactile sensation at the corres-
ponding finger of the participant, when executed by one’s self.
In incongruent trials, the tactile sensation was incompatible
with the observed hand movement. For human hand stimuli,
we used the right hand of a Caucasian female, whereas a right
mannequin hand was used for wooden hand stimuli. A cen-
tral fixation mark (‘þ’ sign) was continuously presented during
trials. In 10% of the trials of each condition, the fixation mark
changed colours to red, designating the trial to be a target.
Participants were instructed to count the number of red fixation
crosses they had seen. During the breaks, the participant
was required to give in this count with his left hand via the
number keys on the keyboard. After this, accuracy feedback was
offered.
The design consisted of two within-subjects factors and
one
between-subjects
factor:

 Congruency [congruent (C) vs incongruent (I)] and Group (CON
vs HFA), respectively. The within-subjects factors led to four ex-
perimental conditions: human congruent, human incongruent,
wood congruent and wood incongruent. We presented human
and wooden hand trials in separate blocks, of which the order
was counterbalanced across participants. Within each animacy
block, we randomly presented 200 congruent and 200 incongru-
ent trials, leading to 800 trials in total. Index finger and middle
finger movements were equiprobable per condition. After every
40 trials, self-paced breaks occurred. The experiment proper
lasted about 50 min.
EEG recording and analyses
EEG was recorded with a Biosemi Activetwo amplifier at a sam-
pling rate of 1024 Hz from 64 active electrodes, placed according
to the international 10/20 setting. For offline re-referencing, two
electrodes were placed on the mastoids. To measure horizontal
eye movements, bipolar electrodes with left and right cantal
montage were placed, whereas electrodes above and below the
left eye served to measure eye blinks. We held electrode offsets
between �25 and 25 mV at each electrode.
The EEG data were analysed with BrainVision Analyzer 2
(BVA; Brain Products). The average of the left and right mastoid
was used as a reference for the raw data. A high pass filter of
0.1 Hz, a low pass filter of 30 Hz and a notch filter of 50 Hz were
performed. Epochs were defined from �100 ms to 400 ms
around the onset of the tactile stimulation. The ERPs were
automatically
corrected
for
eye
movement
artefacts.
Additionally, we applied an automatic artefact rejection includ-
ing a minimum/maximum amplitude check (�100 mV and
100 mV, respectively), a gradient check (maximum allowed volt-
age step: 50 mV/ms within 200 ms before and after the locked
event), a low activity check (0.5 mV within an interval length of
100 ms) and a baseline correction. Because we were interested
in congruency-related processes, the data were collapsed over
left and right finger movements observations. Target trials were
not considered for analyses.
All statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS Statistics
22 on exported mean area amplitudes. We used time frames
and electrode positions of interest identical to those reported
in our earlier study (Deschrijver et al., 2015): 45–55 ms at elec-
trode sites AF3, AFz, F3 and F1 for the P50 component; 85–100
ms at identical electrode sites for the N100 component; 105–
120 ms at electrode sites FC3, FC5, C3 and C5 for the N140 com-
ponent; 230–270 ms and 310–360 ms at electrodes Cz, CPz and
Pz for the early and late P3 component, respectively. For each
ERP-component of interest, we pooled the data over the rele-
vant electrode positions and performed a 2 � 2 � 2 mixed-
model ANOVA (with the within-subjects factors Animacy and
Congruency and a between-subjects factor Group). Where
needed,
Greenhouse-Geisser-corrected
analyses
were
re-
ported. All EEG-data of the CON group (but none of the HFA
group) were included as a part of our first manuscript on the
action-based sensory congruency paradigm (Deschrijver et al.,
2015).

 Results
Behavioural results
For the CON group, a correct counting response was given on
91.11% of break questions on average (SD ¼ 8.15%), whereas this
was the case for 89.47% of the break questions in the HFA group
(SD ¼ 14.03%). A Chi-Square test on these data yielded no group
difference (X2¼0.48, P ¼ 0.49). This suggests a similar task-
involvement for both groups.
EEG results
SEPs. P50. Individuals in the CON group showed numerically
larger P50 amplitudes in wooden congruent trials as com-
pared to wooden incongruent trials, with no congruency dif-
ference in human hand trials. For individuals with HFA, the
congruency effect for wooden hand trials numerically re-
versed (Figures 2 and 3A). However, the ANOVA showed only
a marginally significant three-way interaction of Animacy,
Congruency and Group [F(1,34) ¼ 3.66, P ¼ 0.06]. Because we
did not have a priori hypotheses about a P50 group difference,
we did not investigate this marginally significant effect any
further.
N100. The ANOVA on N100 amplitudes yielded a significant
main effect of Animacy [F(1,34) ¼ 8.50, P < 0.01; Figures 2 and
3AC] and an Animacy � Group interaction effect [F(1,34) ¼ 5.40,
P < 0.05). Control participants showed larger N100 amplitudes
for human hand trials as compared to wooden hand trials
[t(16) ¼ �3.81, P < 0.01, animacy effect M ¼ 0.26 mV], whereas this
animacy
difference
was
not
present
in
the
HFA
group
[t(18) ¼ �0.41, P ¼ 0.69; animacy effect: M ¼ 0.04 mV]. No other ef-
fects approached significance (all P’s > 0.10).
N140. The ANOVA identified a reliable main effect of
Animacy in the N140 [F(1,34) ¼ 10.12, P < 0.005; Figures 2 and
3BD]. The interaction effect of Animacy and Group was far from
significant [F(1,34) ¼ 0.26, P ¼ 0.61]. This suggests that both
groups showed a larger N140 for human than for wooden hand
stimuli (pooled animacy effect for CON: M ¼ 0.82 mV; for HFA:
M ¼ 0.50 mV).
P3. Early P3. In the early P3, the ANOVA yielded a strong inter-
action
effect
of
Animacy
and
Congruency
[F(1,34) ¼ 9.40,
P < 0.005; Figures 2 and 4A]. A marginally significant interaction
effect of Animacy, Congruency and Group was also present
[F(1,34) ¼ 3.19, P ¼ 0.083]. Given our a priori hypotheses regarding
the P3-effects, we tentatively investigated this effect further.
The CON group showed a highly significant difference between
congruent and incongruent human hand trials [t(16) ¼ 4.48,
P < 0.001; mean difference M ¼ 0.71 mV] whereas this difference
was not significant for the HFA group [t(18) ¼ 0.85, P ¼ 0.40;
mean difference M ¼ 0.16 mV]. Neither of the groups showed a
significant congruency difference in the wooden hand trials [for
CON: t(16) ¼ �1.04, P ¼ 0.31, mean difference M ¼ 0.34 mV; for
HFA: t(18) ¼ �0.69, P ¼ 0.50, mean difference M ¼ 0.12 mV).
Late P3. In the late P3-component, the ANOVA revealed an al-
most significant main effect of Congruency [F(1,34) ¼ 4.06,
P ¼ 0.05; Figures 2 and 4AB] and a strong continuation of the ear-
lier
described
Congruency
�
Animacy
interaction
effect
[F(1,34) ¼ 16.73, P < 0.001; Figure 3A and B]. Importantly, we also
detected a three-way interaction of Animacy, Congruency and
Group
[F(1,34) ¼ 4.45,
P < 0.05].
Again,
paired
comparisons
showed that the CON group distinguished clearly between con-
gruent
and
incongruent
human
hand
trials
[t(16) ¼ 4.01,
P ¼ 0.001; mean congruency difference M ¼ 1.13 mV], while this
effect was smaller and only marginally significant in the HFA
group
[t(18) ¼ 1.8,
P ¼ 0.09;
mean
congruency
difference:
M ¼ 0.44m]. Neither of the groups showed a congruency effect in
wooden
hand
trials:
t(16) ¼ �1.73,
P ¼ 0.10
for
CON
and
t(18) ¼ �0.38, P ¼ 0.71 for HFA.
Correlation results
Given our strong hypothesis that the P3 effect in the HFA group
would show relationships with self-reported measures of social
autistic difficulties and sensory avoidance/hypersensitivity, we
computed for each individual in the HFA group an index of this
effect [P3-index ¼ (human congruent – human incongruent) �
(wood congruent – wood incongruent)]. The P3-index and in the
HFA group showed a negative relationship with the Sensation
Avoidance quadrant of the SP-NL (r ¼ �0.51, P < 0.05), a margin-
ally
significant
negative
relationship
with
the
Sensation
Sensitivity quadrant (r ¼ �0.44, P ¼ 0.07). While sensory process-
ing theories of ASD have mainly focused on explaining sensory
hypersensitivity and avoidance behaviours (Van De Cruys et al.,
2014), it might not surprise that the other two quadrants of the
SP-NL yielded relatively high though insignificant correlations
(for Low Registration: r ¼ �0.32, P ¼ 0.20; for Sensation Seeking:
r ¼ 0.42, P ¼ 0.08). As such, we focused on the relationships with
the Sensations Sensitivity and Sensation Avoidance quadrants
(Figure 4C). In addition, we observed a significant relationship

 between
the
P3-index
and
the
SRS-A
(r ¼ �0.53,
P < 0.05;
Figure 4C). The SRS-A scale and the Sensory Sensitivity/
Avoidance quadrants of the SP-NL correlated highly positively
(r ¼ 0.74, P ¼ 0.001 and r ¼ 0.68, P < 0.005, respectively). These re-
sults suggest that a reduced P3 in HFA is related to sensory and
social difficulties in the daily life of individuals with HFA. While
such correlations should also be expected in the normal popula-
tion overall, the limited range of autism scores limits the possi-
bility that such relationships would be detectable in the current
CON group. Additional correlational analyses in the CON group
were therefore not conducted.
Discussion
In the current study, we explored how adults with HFA use the
sense of touch to process simulated action-based touch of
others. More specifically, by means of the action-based somato-
sensory congruency paradigm (Deschrijver et al., 2015) and EEG, we
examined
neuronal
comparison
processes
of
action-based
touch observation and own touch. The HFA group showed
altered neural processing of the stimuli at early stages of own
somatosensory processing (N100 SEP effects) and at late stages
of more high-level processing (reflected in the P3-complex).
Crucially, as predicted, a congruency effect for human hands
within the amplitudes of the late P3 component was present for
the control group, but diminished for the HFA group. In add-
ition, this effect showed negative correlations with both social
and sensory difficulties experienced by the HFA group in every-
day life.
Biological attention differences in early
somatosensory processing: SEP-results
The SEP data of the current study suggested that adults with
HFA show an altered interplay of observed action-based touch
and felt touch already at an early low-level stage of processing,
as compared to neurotypical controls (Allison et al., 1992; Hilton
et al., 2010; Lundqvist, 2015). Earlier studies related facilitation
of the SEPs around 100 ms to attentional demands in somato-
sensory processes in the primary somatosensory cortex (Allison
et al., 1992; Eimer and Driver, 2000; Eimer and Forster, 2003;
Schubert et al., 2006; Schubert et al., 2008; Deschrijver et al., 2015;
Popovich and Staines, 2015), whereas N140 SEP amplitudes are
usually modulated by processes in the secondary somatosen-
sory cortex that are considered as independent of attention
processes (Allison et al., 1992; Popovich and Staines, 2015). The
lacking animacy effect in the N100 may thus suggest a failure to
direct attention to human hands (Popovich and Staines, 2015),
while the attention-independent somatosensory animacy pro-
cessing in the N140 was well preserved. This interpretation fits
well within current views on ASD that highlight difficulties to
direct
attention
to
biological
stimuli
(Annaz
et
al.,
2012;
Chevallier et al., 2012; Jones and Klin, 2013). Our HFA group
seemed able to compensate for this within somewhat later
somatosensory processes (N140).

 Compromised higher-order self-related
processes: P3 results
In social neuroscience research, modulation of the P3 compo-
nent has been related to self versus other-related processes (for
a review, see Knyazev, 2013). Studies have for instance reported
amplified P3 components for hearing one’s own name or seeing
one’s own face as compared to hearing/seeing another person’s
name/face (Perrin et al., 2005; Holeckova et al., 2006; Tacikowski
and Nowicka, 2010; Tacikowski et al., 2011; Cygan et al., 2014;
Tacikowski et al., 2014), for touch experienced by another body
that is congruent to own touch (Longo et al., 2012; Deschrijver
et al., 2015), and for observed actions that are compatible with
own (intended) actions (de la Asuncion et al., 2015; Ruissen and
de Bruijn, 2015). In the current study, we found that adults with
HFA show deficits in signalling simulated action-based touch
that does not match felt own touch, as reflected in a reduced P3.
If a modulation of the P3-component within this task indeed re-
flects self-other distinction processes, the current P3 findings
may suggest that ASD is associated with difficulties in distin-
guishing self from other based on touch processes. Indeed,
when observed action-based touch that does not match own
touch is not adequately signalled in the brain, it might become
difficult for the brain to determine when observed (tactile con-
sequences of) actions are not one’s own. In the social world, in-
dividuals with HFA might thus not only experience a distorted
sense of self, but also a inaccurate sense of others (Lombardo
et al., 2010; Paladino et al., 2010; Lombardo and Baron-Cohen,
2011). While the ability to distinguish between self and others is
extremely crucial for social understanding (Brass et al., 2009;
Spengler et al., 2009; Paladino et al., 2010; Spengler et al., 2010), it
might not surprise that the late P3-effect reliably correlated
with social impairments in the HFA group (see also further).
Our findings link two lines of research that have recently at-
tested self-other distinction deficits in ASD. First, studies have
demonstrated that effects of the rubber hand illusion (Tsakiris
and Haggard, 2005) vary subtly along the non-clinical and clin-
ical autism spectrum (Cascio et al., 2012; Paton et al., 2012;
Palmer et al., 2013). These findings hint towards compromised
self-other distinction mechanisms centred on passive touch
processes. In addition, the current results relate to studies that
suggest difficulties of individuals with HFA in distinguishing
the self from others on a motor level (Brass et al., 2009; Spengler
et al., 2010). In sum, the neuronal representation of the self as
similar or distinct of others seems to rely heavily on higher-
order comparison processes of own and simulated sensori-
motor information, which may be compromised in ASD (Brass
et al., 2009; Spengler et al., 2009; Cascio et al., 2012; Paton et al.,
2012; Palmer et al., 2013; Deschrijver et al., 2015; Palmer et al.,
2015; yet see also Gowen et al., 2008; Grecucci et al., 2013; Press
et al., 2010; Sowden et al., 2016).
Exploring the relationship between the P3 effect and
sensory difficulties in ASD
More and more researchers suggest that the cognitive system of
individuals with ASD is hypersensitive for incoming sensory in-
formation (Pellicano and Burr, 2012; Palmer et al., 2013; van
Boxtel and Lu, 2013; Van De Cruys et al., 2014; Palmer et al.,
2015), while social difficulties of individuals might arise as a

 consequence of this (Van De Cruys et al., 2014). Confirming our
last more exploratory hypothesis, we showed that sensory and
social difficulties of individuals with HFA both showed an in-
verse relationship with the strength of the late P3-effect. This
suggests that the individuals in the HFA group who reported the
most severe hypersensitivity/avoidance and social difficulties,
showed the weakest interaction effect in the late P3 (suggesting
more severely compromised self-other distinction abilities).
While experimental research is needed to explore the causal
directionality within the observed relationships, we can for now
only speculate about their functional meaning. However, it is
interesting to note that P3 components have been associated to
sensory unexpectedness (Escera et al., 2003; Friedman et al.,
2001). Therefore, we think that the uncertainty accompanying
simulated touch information might interfere with the ability to
adequately distinguish simulated from own somatosensory in-
formation, which may consequently relate to social difficulties.
Interestingly, some authors have argued that self-other distinc-
tion abilities (based on motor representations) may underlie
crucial social-cognitive mentalizing abilities in typically de-
veloping
individuals
as
well
as
in
individuals
with
ASD
(Spengler et al., 2009, 2010). In the same respect, one might ten-
tatively reason that deficient self-other distinction centred on
action-based touch in individuals with ASD may be related to
mentalizing abilities, which are known to be affected in at least
some
individuals
with
ASD
(Baron-Cohen
et
al.,
1985;
Deschrijver et al., 2016). As such, compromised self-other dis-
tinction abilities centred on touch might denote a crucial theor-
etical link between sensory and social impairments in the
autism spectrum.
Conclusions
In the current study, we investigated whether adults with HFA
show
difficulties
in
matching
experienced
and
simulated
action-based touch. We showed altered processing in the HFA
group at an early stage of somatosensory processing (N100) and
to a late stage of higher-order self-other distinction (early and
late P3). At low-level somatosensory stages, individuals with
HFA did not direct somatosensory attention to biological stimuli
(as reflected in altered N100 SEP effects), while they might have
compensated for this in attention-independent somatosensory
processes (intact N140 effects; Popovich and Staines, 2015). At
high-levels stages of self-related processing, individuals with
HFA were less able to signal observed action-based touch that
does not match one’s own sensation of touch (reflected in an
altered P3 interaction effect). This effect reliably correlated to
sensory and social difficulties of individuals with HFA. In sum,
the results contain the first demonstration of an atypical inter-
play of action-based touch simulation and actual experience of
touch in adults with HFA, while showing a functional relation-
ship with both social and sensory ideosyncracies related to
ASD.
