ABSTRACT
Background: Ultraprocessed food consumption has increased in
the past decade. Evidence suggests a positive association between
ultraprocessed food consumption and the incidence of overweight
and obesity. However, few prospective studies to our knowledge
have investigated this potential relation in adults.
Objective: We evaluated the association between ultraprocessed
food consumption and the risk of overweight and obesity in a prospec-
tive Spanish cohort, the SUN (University of Navarra Follow-Up) study.
Design: We included 8451 middle-aged Spanish university gradu-
ates who were initially not overweight or obese and followed up for
a median of 8.9 y. The consumption of ultraprocessed foods (de-
fined as food and drink products ready to eat, drink, or heat and
made predominantly or entirely from processed items extracted or
refined from whole foods or synthesized in the laboratory) was
assessed with the use of a validated semiquantitative 136-item
food-frequency questionnaire. Cox proportional hazards models
were used to estimate adjusted HRs and 95% CIs for incident
overweight and obesity.
Results: A total of 1939 incident cases of overweight and obesity
were identified during follow-up. After adjustment for potential
confounders, participants in the highest quartile of ultraprocessed
food consumption were at a higher risk of developing overweight or
obesity (adjusted HR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.45; P-trend = 0.001)
than those in the lowest quartile of consumption.
Conclusions: Ultraprocessed food consumption was associated
with a higher risk of overweight and obesity in a prospective cohort
of Spanish middle-aged adult university graduates. Further longitu-
dinal studies are needed to confirm our results. This trial was reg-
istered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02669602.

INTRODUCTION
Obesity is a worldwide problem with increasing prevalence. In
2014, more than half a billion adults were obese, and 39% were
overweight. In the Americas, w30% of women and 25% of men
were obese, and in the Eastern Mediterranean w25% of women
and 15% of men were obese (1).
Changes in the food system continuously promote obesity.
There is now a greater availability of ready-to-eat or -heat foods
known as ultraprocessed foods, which are products that have
little, if any, whole foods and are manufactured with substances
extracted from foods or synthesized in laboratories (dyes, fla-
vorings, and other additives) (2). They have high amounts of fat,
sugar, and salt and a high energy density and low fiber content;
they are extremely palatable foods that are aggressively adver-
tised (3) and contain a large diversity of chemical additives.
Examples of ultraprocessed foods include breakfast cereals,
reconstituted meat products, soft drinks, and ready-to-eat
foodstuffs (2).
Several prospective studies have been carried out to assess the
relation between dietary components and obesity. An analysis of
3 American cohorts, the Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health
Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, showed
that the consumption of foodstuffs such as sweets, desserts,
processed meats, fries, and sugar-sweetened beverages were
strongly associated with weight gain in US adults (4). However,
the relation between the consumption of foods aggregated
according to their degree of processing (i.e., ultraprocessed foods)
and excess weight has only recently been analyzed.
A cross-sectional times series study in 15 Latin American
countries revealed an association between sales of ultraprocessed
foods and changes in body weight in 12 countries from 2000 to
2009 (5). Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated an associ-
ation between the consumption of these foods and the risk of
metabolic syndrome in adolescents (6) and obesity in adolescents

 and adults (7, 8). A study of children aged 3–8 y in a low-income
community in Brazil showed that ultraprocessed food con-
sumption was an important predictor of the increase in total
cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (9). On the other hand, a study
with data from the 2008–2012 United Kingdom National Diet
and Nutrition Survey showed no association between ultra-
processed food consumption and body weight. However, diets
with smaller quantities of ultraprocessed foods have better nu-
tritional quality (10).
Studies have shown an association between specific types of
ultraprocessed foods, such as soft drinks, and being overweight or
obese. However, no prospective cohort study to our knowledge
has been performed to evaluate the association between all
ultraprocessed foods as a group and the incidence of overweight
and obesity in adults. Therefore, in this study (NCT02669602),
we evaluated the association of ultraprocessed food consumption
with the incidence of overweight and obesity in a Mediterranean
cohort with a prolonged follow-up.
METHODS
Study population
The SUN (University of Navarra Follow-Up) Project is a dy-
namic and multipurpose prospective cohort study with perma-
nently open recruitment conducted in Spain among university
graduates since December 1999. The participants are followed up
biennially with the use of questionnaires distributed by post or
electronic mail. Details of its design have been published else-
where (11, 12).
Up to March 2012, the SUN data set included 21,291 par-
ticipants who had answered the baseline questionnaire. In this study,
we excluded those classified as overweight or obese [BMI (in kg/m2)
$25] at baseline (n = 6340), individuals who reported total energy
intake values outside of predefined limits [low: ,3347 kJ/d
or ,800 kcal/d in men and ,2092 kJ/d or ,500 kcal/d in women;
high: .16,736 kJ/d or .4000 kcal/d in men and .14,644 kJ/d
or .3500 kcal/d in women (n = 1713)] (13), women who were
pregnant at baseline or became pregnant during the follow-up
period (n = 2739), and individuals who reported a previously di-
agnosed chronic disease at baseline (e.g., diabetes, cancer, car-
diovascular disease) (n = 618). In addition, we excluded participants
with a weight change .10 kg in the 5 y preceding entry into the
study to reduce potential sources of confounding by other causes of
weight changes (n = 260). Among the remaining participants, 1106
subjects were lost to follow-up, and 64 participants had missing
values in $1 variable of interest. After these exclusions, a total of
8451 participants were included in the final analyses (Figure 1).
The retention rate of the study was w89%.
This study was conducted according to Declaration of Helsinki
guidelines, and all procedures involving human subjects were
approved by the University of Navarra institutional review board.
Voluntary completion of the baseline self-administrated ques-
tionnaire was considered to imply informed consent.
Exposure assessment: ultraprocessed food consumption
Dietary exposures were assessed at baseline through a self-
administered 136-item semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire
(FFQ) that was previously validated in Spain (14, 15). Frequencies of
consumption were measured in 9 categories (ranging from never or
almost never to .6 servings/d), and the FFQ included a typical
portion size for each item. Daily food consumption was estimated by
multiplying the portion size by the consumption frequency for each
food item.
The foods were classified according to NOVA (2) based on the
extent and purpose of applied food processing. There are 4
groups in this classification scheme. The first group includes
foods that are fresh or processed in ways that did not add sub-
stances such as salt, sugar, oils, or fats and infrequently contain
additives. Processes used are aimed to extend life, allow storage
for long use, and facilitate or diversify preparation (freezing,
drying, and pasteurization). Examples are fruits and vegetables,
grains (cereals), flours, nuts and seeds, fresh and pasteurized
milk, natural yogurt with no added sugar or artificial sweeteners,
meat and fish, tea, coffee, drinking water, spices, and herbs. The
second group contains processed culinary ingredients. These are
substances obtained from the first group or from nature and may
contain additives to preserve the original properties. Examples
are salt, sugar, honey, vegetable oils, butter, lard, and vinegar.
The third group is processed food made with the addition of
substances such as salt, sugar, or oil and the use of processes
such as smoking, curing, or fermentation. Examples are canned
or bottled vegetables and legumes, fruits in syrup, canned fish,
cheeses, freshly made bread, and salted or sugared nuts and
seeds. The fourth group is ultraprocessed food and drink prod-
ucts that are made predominantly or entirely from industrial
substances and contain little or no whole foods. These products
are ready to eat, drink, or heat. Examples include carbonated
drinks, sausages, biscuits (cookies), candy (confectionery), fruit
yogurts, instant packaged soups and noodles, sweet or savory
packaged snacks, and sugared milk and fruit drinks (2). It is this
fourth group that is the main subject of this study. Supplemental
Table 1 describes the classification of FFQ foods according to
NOVA. The frequency of ultraprocessed food consumption was
estimated with the use of the sum of the food items from the
fourth group in the FFQ (total of 33 items). The sample was di-
vided into quartiles according to total consumption (servings/d).
Outcome assessment
Self-reported weight and height were validated with a previous
study (16). The outcome used the incidence of overweight and
obesity (BMI $25) during follow-up and was defined as the first
time participants reached a BMI of 25 during follow-up.
Assessment of other variables
The baseline questionnaire also included questions relating to
the following variables: sex, age, marital status, educational status,
smoking status, physical activity, television watching, siesta sleep,
diet and dietary habits, and snacking between main meals. Physical
activity was evaluated with the use of a validated 17-item ques-
tionnaire (17). Total energy, macronutrient, fiber, and alcohol intake
and fruit, vegetable, fast-food, fried-food, processed meat, non-
processed meat, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption was
assessed with the use of the FFQ (15). Nutrient intake scores were
computed with the use of a computer program developed spe-
cifically by our dietitians for this purpose. Adherence to the
Mediterranean dietary pattern was evaluated with the use of a well-
known score (18).

 Statistical analyses
Differences in baseline characteristics of participants according
to ultraprocessed food consumption quartiles were evaluated with
ANOVA and adjusted for sex and age. To evaluate the relation
between ultraprocessed food consumption at baseline and the
subsequent risk of the development of overweight and obesity
during follow-up, we used Cox proportional hazards models, and to
estimate HRs and 95% CIs we used the lowest quartile as the
reference category.
The follow-up period was defined as the interval between the
date of recruitment and date of the return of the follow-up
questionnaire in which the participant was classified as overweight
or obese for the first time (for incident cases). The date of death or
of the last questionnaire was used for noncases.
Tests for linear trends were conducted by assigning medians of
ultraprocessed food consumption to each category and treating
this variable as a continuous variable in the respective Cox re-
gression model. We fitted a first model without any adjustment
(crude), a second model adjusted for age and sex, and a third
multivariable-adjusted model adjusted for age, sex, marital sta-
tus, educational status, baseline BMI, physical activity, television
watching, siesta sleep, smoking status, snacking between meals,
and following a special diet. Total energy intake was not included
as a covariate because it may plausibly mediate the association of
ultraprocessed foods and overweight and obesity. We evaluated
the interaction between exposure, sex, and BMI with the use of
a likelihood ratio test that compared the fully adjusted Cox re-
gression model and the same model with interaction product
terms (3 df). Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazards estimates were
plotted for overweight and obesity incidence according to
ultraprocessed food consumption quartiles at baseline. We used
inverse probability weighting to adjust the Nelson-Aalen curves
for baseline potential confounders.
To test the proportional hazard assumption, we calculated a Cox
regression with the exposure as a continuous time-varying covariate
to check that the HR did not vary over time, obtaining a non-
significant result, suggesting that the proportionality assumption was
met. We also checked the proportionality of hazards model with the
use of a Grambsch-Therneau test of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals
from a Cox model on the 3 dummy variables of the upper ultra-
processed quartiles (19). The P value of the global test was 0.72.
To determine the contribution of each food item to the between-
person variance in ultraprocessed food consumption (13), we
constructed a series of nested least-squares linear regression
models after stepwise-selection regression analyses. The additional

 contribution of a given food item was reflected in the change in
the cumulative R2.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted by repeating the multivariable-
adjusted Cox regression models with the following changes: 1) ad-
ditional adjustment excluding fruit and vegetable consumption, 2)
exclusion of those participants under the 5th percentile and over the
95th percentile of total energy intake, 3) additional adjustment for total
energy intake, 4) additional adjustment for family history of obesity,
5) additional adjustment for weight gain .3 kg in the 5 y before
entering the cohort, 6) exclusion of participants who were early
incident cases of overweight (those who became overweight after
only 2 y of follow-up), and 7) inclusion of subjects with prevalent
chronic diseases.
All analyses were performed with Stata version 12.1 (Stata-
Corp LP). P , 0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS
A total of 2967 (35.1%) men and 5484 (64.9%) women were
included in this analysis, and the mean 6 SD age of the par-
ticipants was 37.6 6 11.0 y. The main baseline characteristics of
participants according to quartiles of total ultraprocessed food
consumption are presented in Table 1. Participants in the fourth
quartile of ultraprocessed food consumption had the highest
BMI, were more likely to be current smokers, watched more
television, and had the highest total energy and fat intake and the

 lowest protein and total fiber than those in the first quartile.
Moreover, on average, they consumed more fast food, fried
foods, processed and other meats, and sugar-sweetened beverages.
In contrast, they had the lowest intakes of vegetables and were less
likely to follow special diets. In addition, they had the highest
prevalence of snacking between main meals. In addition, the
adherence to the Mediterranean diet score varied according to
quartiles of ultraprocessed food (i.e., the higher the con-
sumption of ultraprocessed foods, the less adherence to the
Mediterranean diet).
The contributions of different food groups to ultraprocessed
food intake are shown in Table 2. Processed meat, biscuits and
cookies, sugar-sweetened beverages, and candies were among
the major contributors to ultraprocessed food consumption
variability.
During the follow-up period (median: 8.9 y; person-years:
66,625), we observed 1939 incident cases of overweight and
obesity. In the multivariate models, when we assessed the risk of
overweight and obesity according to quartiles of ultraprocessed
foods consumption (Table 3), participants with higher ultra-
processed food intake (highest quartile) presented a 26% rela-
tively higher risk of developing overweight or obesity than those
in the lowest quartile (HR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.45). The esti-
mates showed a statistically significant linear trend (P = 0.001).
The Nelson-Aalen curves exhibited a higher incidence of over-
weight and obesity with increasing baseline quartiles of ultra-
processed food intake (Figure 2). No significant interaction
between sex or BMI and ultraprocessed food consumption was
observed. Results in the sensitivity analyses described previously
were not substantially changed in any of the scenarios (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
In this prospective cohort study with initially healthy, middle-
aged, Spanish adults, higher ultraprocessed food consumption
was associated with an increased risk of overweight and obesity
incidence for a mean of w9 y of follow-up, even after adjusting
for potential confounding factors.
Recent ecological and cross-sectional studies on ultraprocessed
food consumption and the risk of overweight and obesity have
shown an association between increased ultraprocessed food
consumption and obesity among adolescents and adults (5, 7, 8,
20). To our knowledge, this is the first prospective epidemiologic
study to assess this association among adults.
The food and drinks classified as ultraprocessed foods are
mostly manufactured by large and powerful transnational com-
panies. These companies focus their marketing on the individual’s
lack of time compared with the expediency, convenience, and
accessibility of these products (21, 22). However, ultraprocessed
foods tend to be nutritionally unbalanced and have a high energy
content and amounts of fat, added or free sugar, sodium, and
chemical additives in addition to being poor in micronutrients
and fiber (3, 21, 23, 24). This nutritional composition is
caused by several industrial processes, such as the removal of
water, which increases the shelf life and reduces trans-
portation costs but increases the energy density per portion. In
addition, to confer greater stability, ultraprocessed foods have
a greater amount of trans and saturated fats and synthetic
additives (24). Ultraprocessed foods are also designed to be
irresistible and to favor consumption (because of the use of
salt, sugar, and fat but also because of marketing and other
characteristics such as portion size and convenience), and the
processing also affects food behavior and the capacity for self-
control (2, 3). This new classification proposal of foods ac-
cording to the degree of processing (2) therefore seems to be
a good way of assessing their intake and relation to health
outcomes because it can identify the consumption of a group
of foods and drinks with low nutritional quality rather than
just a certain food or nutrient.

 The sales of ultraprocessed foods increased between 2000 and
2013. Despite the United States being the largest buyer, sales of
these products in Spain grew 18.5%, followed by Canada,
Germany, and Mexico (5). In a longitudinal study of food and
beverage consumer packaged goods purchased by US house-
holds, the 2000–2012 Nielsen Homescan Panel showed that 61%
of the energy in purchases by US households in 2012 was derived
from ultraprocessed foods (25). The 2008–2012 United Kingdom
National Diet and Nutrition Survey, a large national cross-sectional
study of diet, showed that diets with a higher intake of minimally
processed foods and lower intake of ultraprocessed foods are as-
sociated with a more healthy food profile, but this was not asso-
ciated with body weight (10). Studies from Canada and Brazil,
conducted with data from national household food budget surveys,
have also demonstrated a direct association between ultraprocessed
food consumption and a diet with a high energy density and intake
of sugars, sodium, and total and saturated fats and an inverse as-
sociation with fiber intake (3, 21). Moreover, a study from Brazil
that examined data from a national household food budget survey
showed that higher ultraprocessed food consumption was associ-
ated with the lowest intakes of vitamin B-12, vitamin D, niacin,
iron, selenium, and magnesium (26).
We believe that ultraprocessed food consumption may increase
the risk of overweight and obesity by increasing the total intake of
calories, added and free sugars, and fats and providing an in-
adequate relation of nutrients potentially involved in the genesis
of the accumulation of body fat (1, 3, 21–24, 26). A cross-
sectional study from the United States with data from NHANES
2009–2010 showed that ultraprocessed food represented 57.9%
of energy intake and that w90% of this amount was derived

 from added sugars (23). The participants in our cohort with
a higher daily consumption of ultraprocessed foods had a higher
consumption of total calories and fat, a lower consumption of
proteins and fibers, and a lower adherence to the Mediterranean
dietary pattern.
The Nurses’ Health Study showed a strong association be-
tween the percentage of calories from saturated and trans fats
and weight gain (27). Results from the Nurses’ Health Study II
also showed that an increase in dietary energy density was a risk
factor for obesity (28). A meta-analysis of cohort studies and
randomized clinical trials has provided evidence of the relation
between the intake of sugar and the development of overweight
and obesity (29). On the other hand, the consumption of natural
foods such as fruits, vegetables, fish, and fiber—but not red
meat—is inversely associated with the incidence of overweight
and obesity (4, 30).
Our findings stress the importance of promoting and enhancing
healthy and sustainable food standards, which requires structural
and behavioral changes. Food systems should improve the supply
of healthy foods and foster healthier food choices (31). This may
be accomplished by promoting and enhancing eating habits based
on foods and cuisine, such as the Mediterranean dietary pattern.
Several studies have demonstrated its association with the re-
duction of weight gain because it consists predominantly of fruits,
vegetables, legumes, nuts, olive oil, and fish (17, 32). Therefore,
the Mediterranean diet is based on the consumption of fresh
foods; multiple studies have demonstrated its preventive effect
against chronic diseases (32–35).
Some limitations may be observed in this study. The assess-
ment of ultraprocessed food consumption was performed with the
use of an FFQ that was not specifically designed to collect data
regarding this new classification of foods. Therefore, there is the
potential for some degree of misclassification of ultraprocessed
food consumption inherent in our methodology. However, our
FFQ was previously validated and represents the main foods
ingested by the studied population (15), including ultraprocessed
foods. Hamburgers are classified as an ultraprocessed food
according to NOVA (2). Hamburgers are not ground beef but are
a dish made of industrial breads, sauces, reconstituted meat,
processed cheese, bacon, etc. Therefore, we included hamburgers
intheultraprocessedfoodgroup. Some hamburgerscanbehomemade,
and doubts may arise about their inclusion in this group. Un-
fortunately, our study could not differentiate between fast-food and
homemade hamburgers. Even when we removed hamburgers from
the ultraprocessed foods, the results were only slightly attenuated
(HR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.41; P-trend = 0.003).
Self-reported data were used to evaluate the BMI and to
classify the overweight and obesity incident cases. This may
not be precise enough, especially because we cannot accu-
rately specify the date of onset of the overweight or obese status.
Nevertheless, this method was previously validated (16). In
addition, the participants were health professionals, and this fact
is likely to have increased the validity of their self-reported
anthropometric data.
Potential confounding may still be possible. Nevertheless, we
adjusted for several potential confounding factors related to
lifestyle. Caution is needed in extrapolating the results to the
general population because the SUN participants are volunteer
university graduates. This group could be more aware of health,
thus causing a selection bias that implies that the magnitude of the
risk between ultraprocessed food consumption and excess weight
may be even greater in the general population. Conversely, the
participants have a higher educational status and are capable of
providing better quality self-reported data, thus reducing the
potential for misclassification bias. Nevertheless, we must be
cautious with regard to the generalization of the results because
they do not depend on the statistical representativeness of the
sample but on the biological mechanisms underlying the ob-
served association.
The main strengths of this study are its prospective design, the
use of validated methods (15, 16), the relatively large sample size,
and the long follow-up period. In addition, this is one of the first
longitudinal studies to our knowledge to evaluate the relation
between ultraprocessed food intake and overweight and obesity.
Further studies should be performed to investigate whether
there is a relation between increased ultraprocessed food intake
and major causes of death, such as cardiovascular diseases
and cancer.
The results suggest that increased ultraprocessed food con-
sumption is associated with a greater risk of overweight and
obesity. Strategies for reducing the consumption of this group
of foods, such as the maintenance of a traditional food culture
and strengthening of the Mediterranean diet, should be encouraged
as preventive approaches for obesity. However, further longi-
tudinal studies in different contexts are necessary to confirm our
findings.
