Interstitial fibrosis plays a key role in the development and progression of heart failure. Here,
we show that an enzyme that crosslinks collagen—Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (Loxl2)—is essential
for interstitial fibrosis and mechanical dysfunction of pathologically stressed hearts. In mice,
cardiac stress activates fibroblasts to express and secrete Loxl2 into the interstitium,
triggering fibrosis, systolic and diastolic dysfunction of stressed hearts. Antibody-mediated
inhibition or genetic disruption of Loxl2 greatly reduces stress-induced cardiac fibrosis and
chamber dilatation, improving systolic and diastolic functions. Loxl2 stimulates cardiac
fibroblasts through PI3K/AKT to produce TGF-b2, promoting fibroblast-to-myofibroblast
transformation; Loxl2 also acts downstream of TGF-b2 to stimulate myofibroblast migration.
In diseased human hearts, LOXL2 is upregulated in cardiac interstitium; its levels correlate
with collagen crosslinking and cardiac dysfunction. LOXL2 is also elevated in the serum of
heart failure (HF) patients, correlating with other HF biomarkers, suggesting a conserved
LOXL2-mediated mechanism of human HF.

eart failure (HF) is a leading cause of death, with a
mortality rate of B50% within five years of diagnosis1.
This high mortality rate reflects inadequacy of modern
therapy and calls for a new mechanistic paradigm for treatment.
A major cause of cardiac dysfunction is the adverse tissue
remodelling with interstitial fibrosis2–6, caused
by various
pathological insults that include hypertension and myocardial
infarction, with the extent of interstitial fibrosis prognosticating
clinical outcomes of the diseased heart6. Current therapies that
improve HF survival primarily target the pathogenic mechanisms
that occur within cardiomyocytes but not those mechanisms that
take place outside cardiomyocytes in the interstitial space that
houses collagen and fibroblasts. This lack of direct therapy against
interstitial mechanism of HF may contribute to the persistently
high morbidity and mortality of HF.
The major causes of death in HF are ventricular arrhythmias
and pump failure. Although the arrhythmic death can be
effectively prevented by implantable cardiac defibrillators, death
from pump failure has become an even more pressing issue.
Cardiac systolic and diastolic pump functions are both compro-
mised in patients suffering from HF with reduced ejection
fraction (HFrEF). However, current therapies only have moderate
efficacy in systolic dysfunction and are ineffective for diastolic
pump failure. For patients having HF with preserved ejection
fraction (HFpEF), who have primarily diastolic dysfunction, there
is no proven therapy that can improve diastolic function and
long-term outcome. Therefore, an urgent need remains for novel,
complementary medical therapies, which target maladaptive left
ventricular tissue remodelling/fibrosis to improve systolic and
diastolic functions of failing hearts2.
Interstitial fibrosis plays a key role in the development and
progression of HF by causing adverse mechanical and electrical
disturbances in the diseased hearts2. Interstitial fibrosis impairs
the electromechanical coordination between cardiomyocytes
to compromise systolic contractility. Fibrosis also increases
ventricular stiffness and impairs diastolic relaxation and filling.
We found that Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) is upregulated in
the interstitium of diseased mouse and human hearts. Increased
LOXL2 expression leads to increased TGF-b2 production,
triggering the formation and migration of myofibroblasts with
enhanced collagen deposition and crosslinking in the hyper-
trophic regions of stressed hearts. These effects result in
interstitial fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction. The concept of
targeting LOXL2 in HF is supported by our preclinical data from
cell-based assays, pharmacological studies and mouse genetic
models, as well as by the clinical evidence of elevated cardiac
tissue and serum LOXL2 in HF patients and correlation of tissue
LOXL2 level with fibrosis and cardiac physiological changes in
HF patients. The efficacy of anti-LOXL2 antibody and genetic
LOXL2 disruption in relieving cardiac interstitial fibrosis and
diastolic abnormalities is particularly salient, given the lack of
direct therapy against cardiac fibrosis, and the increasing
emphasis on diastolic dysfunction as an integral part of the heart
failure syndrome.
Results
Loxl2 proteins are elevated in the stressed mouse hearts. We
used transaortic constriction (TAC) to cause pressure overload
and hypertrophy of the hearts of male mice at 6–8 weeks of age7,8.
Quantitative
PCR
(qPCR),
western
blot
analysis
and
immunostaining of left ventricles showed that Loxl2 was
minimally expressed in sham-operated hearts, but it was highly
upregulated within the first week of TAC, and the Loxl2
upregulation persisted for 410 weeks after TAC (Fig. 1a–c,
Supplementary Fig. 1a). Genes that encode other LOX isoforms
(Lox, Loxl1, Loxl3 and Loxl4) were also upregulated in the
stressed hearts but to a lesser extent and consistency than Loxl2
(Supplementary Fig. 1b–e). In TAC-stressed hearts, Loxl2
proteins were present in the interstitial space (Fig. 1c), which
contains fibroblasts and collagen fibres. The upregulation of
Loxl2 in the interstitium was accompanied by transdifferentiation
of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts that are highly migratory
(marked by expression of a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA)) and
synthetic of collagen (marked by expression of collagen, type I,
alpha 1 (Col1A); Fig. 1d). The interstitium of TAC-stressed
hearts,
therefore,
contains
increased
Loxl2
and
collagen-
producing myofibroblasts, providing the enzyme (Loxl2) and
substrates (collagen) required for collagen crosslinking. Indeed,
TAC-stressed
hearts
showed
increased
interstitial
collagen,
which was primarily insoluble (crosslinked; Fig. 1e–g), and such
TAC-induced
progressive
increase
of
crosslinked
collagen
amount correlated strongly and linearly with the decline of left
ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) over time (Fig. 1h,
r ¼ 0.95). Collectively, these findings suggest a role of Loxl2
in stress-induced
interstitial collagen deposits and cardiac
dysfunction.
LOXL2 proteins are increased in the diseased human hearts.
We next tested whether LOXL2 was upregulated in diseased
human hearts. RT–qPCR of heart tissues showed that the
expression of LOXL2 and LOXL4 was low in healthy human
hearts, whereas the other isoforms LOX, LOXL1 and LOXL3 were
more abundant (Fig. 1i). However, in human hearts with
ischaemic
or
non-ischaemic
dilated
cardiomyopathy,
only
LOXL2, but not other LOX isoforms (LOX, LOXL1, LOXL3 and
LOXL4), was highly upregulated (Fig. 1j,k). Immunostaining
verified the upregulation of LOXL2 protein in the interstitium of
diseased human hearts (Fig. 1l). Quantification of messenger
RNA (mRNA) revealed that LOXL2 expression correlated well
with the expression of fibrillar collagen genes (COL1A and
COL3A) in ventricular tissues of healthy donor hearts (n ¼ 8) and
of hearts from patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy
(IDCM, n ¼ 10; Fig. 1m,n and Table 1). The clear separation of
control and cardiomyopathy samples in the LOXL2–COLLAGEN
correlation graphs indicates a functional role of LOXL2 elevation
in the pathogenesis of human fibrotic hearts (Fig. 1m,n).
Collectively, these findings show a specific elevation of the LOXL2
isoform in the interstitial space of diseased human hearts.
LOXL2 is elevated in the serum of patients with heart failure.
To explore the potential use of LOXL2 as a HF biomarker, we
tested whether LOXL2 proteins could be released from cardiac
interstitium into the circulation. We first examined control
subjects and patients with HFrEF (EFr35%), the demographics
of which was in Supplementary Table 1. We found that LOXL2
levels
were
elevated
in
the
serum
of
HFrEF
patients
(129±9 pg ml � 1,
n ¼ 31)
compared
with
control
subjects
(71±4 pg ml � 1, n ¼ 24; Student’s t-test, Po0.0001; Fig. 2a).
A cutoff of LOXL2 at 90–100 pg ml � 1 showed 88% specificity,
74% sensitivity and 80% accuracy in distinguishing HFrEF
from the control subjects (Fig. 2a, red-dashed line). This high
sensitivity/specificity was comparable to that of NT-proBNP, an
established HF biomarker measured in the same serum samples
(225 pg ml � 1 cutoff measured by a research kit had 83%
specificity, 87% sensitivity and 85% accuracy, Fig. 2b). These
numbers of sensitivity and specificity were also comparable to the
published results of NT-proBNP as a diagnostic HF biomarker.
Serum LOXL2 level correlated with that of TIMP-1, a tissue
fibrosis marker9 (Pearson correlation, r ¼ 0.5, Po0.001; Fig. 2c)
and ST-2, a cardiac remodelling and fibrosis marker (Pearson
correlation, r ¼ 0.5, Po0.001; Fig. 2d). Of note, ST-2 plays a

 causal role in HF pathogenesis in animal models10, and ST-2 is a
FDA-approved clinical serum HF biomarker that tracks the
activity of cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes11,12. The
correlations between LOXL2 and ST-2 and TIMP-1 suggest
involvement of LOXL2 in the pathogenesis of human HFrEF.
Additional evidence implying a crucial role of LOXL2 in
human HF came from our studies of patients with severe HFrEF
receiving
left
ventricular
assist
device
(LVAD;
n ¼ 15;
Supplementary Table 1). Those patients that had persistently
low cardiac EF (r35%), despite the LVAD therapy, exhibited
elevated serum LOXL2 (146 pg ml � 1), whereas those who
showed significant EF recovery (Z40%) had serum LOXL2
comparable to control levels (76 pg ml � 1) (Fig. 2e). Serum
LOXL2 levels above 100 pg ml � 1 had 90% sensitivity and 100%
specificity of separating EF non-responders from responders
following LVAD therapy (Fig. 2e). Moreover, EF recovery (DEF)
before and after LVAD therapy correlated well with serum
LOXL2
lowering
(Pearson
correlation,
r ¼ –0.8,
P ¼ 0.001;
Fig. 2f). A cutoff of LOXL2 above 100 pg ml � 1 had 100%
sensitivity
and
specificity
in
separating
EF
non-responder
(DEF o10%) from responders (DEF Z10%; Fig. 2f). These
results not only suggest a potential use of LOXL2 as a biomarker
in this clinical setting, but also implicate a causal role of LOXL2
in human HF.
Serum
LOXL2
levels
were
also
elevated
in
patients
with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF;
127±13 pg ml � 1, n ¼ 25) compared with the control subjects
(73±4 pg ml � 1, n ¼ 24; Student’s t-test, Po0.0001; Fig. 2g).
A cutoff of LOXL2 at 90 pg ml � 1 displayed 83% specificity, 68%
sensitivity and 76% accuracy in distinguishing HFpEF from
control subjects (Fig. 2g, red-dashed line). This high sensitivity/
specificity
was
again
comparable
to
that
of
NT-proBNP,
measured in the same serum samples (225 pg ml � 1 cutoff had
74% specificity, 76% sensitivity and 75% accuracy, Fig. 2h).
Moreover, significant correlation between sLOXL2 and tissue
fibrotic marker TIMP-1 was observed in HFpEF (Fig. 2i). The
serum samples of HFrEF and HFpEF patients were further
validated by elevation of serum Troponin I levels measured by
Loxl2 mRNA expression

 high-sensitivity troponin assays (Fig. 2j,k), suggesting continued
cardiomyocyte injury in those patients. Given its accuracy in
separating HFrEF or HFpEF patients from control subjects,
serum LOXL2 may provide a new biomarker to track cardiac
tissue remodelling and function in HF patients.
LOXL2 correlates with diastolic dysfunction in HFpEF. To
address the diastolic aspect of human heart failure, we studied
control subjects (n ¼ 15) and HFpEF patients (n ¼ 24), whose
demographic, echocardiographic and hemodynamic character-
istics are listed in Table 2. The heart tissues from these patients
showed intense interstitial fibrosis, coinciding with LOXL2
expression (Fig. 3a,b). In HFpEF patients, the extent of collagen
crosslinking in the heart correlated well with diastolic relaxation
abnormalities (measured by echocardiographic E/E0 ratio13) and
with left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP, measured by
cardiac catheterization; Fig. 3c,d). These findings indicate a
crucial role of crosslinked collagen in determining diastolic
relaxation and filling pressure of the left ventricle. More
importantly, cardiac LOXL2 levels correlated with the amount
of crosslinked collagen, the severity of diastolic relaxation
abnormalities (by E/E0 ratio), and the elevation of LVEDP
(Fig. 3e–h). Because LOXL2 catalyses collagen crosslinking, these
correlations support a LOXL2-mediated collagen mechanism that
contributes to the diastolic dysfunction of HFpEF. Furthermore,
the consistent findings of mouse and human heart tissue studies
suggest an evolutionary conservation of LOXL2-based interstitial
mechanism of cardiomyopathy.
Loxl2 inhibition reduces stress-induced cardiac dysfunction.
To determine a causative role of Loxl2 in interstitial fibrosis and
heart failure, we used a LOXL2-specific neutralizing monoclonal
antibody (AB0023, a-LOXL2; refs 6,14) to inhibit Loxl2 activity
in TAC-stressed mouse hearts. TAC and sham operations
were performed on four groups of CD1 male mice—sham/
IgG1, sham/a-LOXL2, TAC/IgG1 and TAC/a-LOXL2 (Fig. 4a).
The a-LOXL2 or control IgG1 treatment (intraperitoneally,
30 mg kg � 1, twice per week) was initiated 2 weeks after TAC,
when the heart already displayed 35% hypertrophy (by ventricle–
body weight ratio) and 25% reduction of left ventricular fractional
shortening (LVFS by echocardiography) (Fig. 4a). Remarkably,
within 2 weeks of treatment, a-LOXL2 stabilized LVFS of
TAC-stressed hearts, preventing further LVFS decline with a
trend toward normalizing LVFS after 8 weeks of treatment
(Fig. 4a). Ten weeks after TAC (8 weeks after treatment), the
IgG1-treated
group
developed
severe
cardiac
hypertrophy
and fibrosis with 80.9% increase of ventricle–body weight ratio,
87.9% increase of end-systolic LV internal diameter (LVIDs),
39.0% increase of end-diastolic LV internal diameter (LVIDd),
and 49.1% reduction of LVFS (Fig. 4b–g). Conversely, a-LOXL2-
treated
mice
displayed
much
less
TAC-induced
cardiac
dysfunction. The interstitial fibrosis was essentially eliminated,
with LVFS increased by 50.9% (P ¼ 0.01) and LV dilatation
reduced by 25.0% (LVIDd, Student’s t-test, P ¼ 0.03; Fig. 4b–f).
Notably, these major improvements of left ventricular function
occurred without significant reduction of cardiomyocyte hyper-
trophy (measured by ventricle–body weight ratio; Fig. 4g) and in
the absence of significant changes of immune cell infiltration into
the myocardium (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). This suggests that the
beneficial effects of a-LOXL2 are caused not by attenuation of
hypertrophy or immune-mediated cardiac damage but rather by
a-LOXL2’s reversal of interstitial fibrosis. Such anti-fibrosis
effects of a-LOXL2 are likely the results of reduced collagen
production
and
enhanced
degradation
of
un-crosslinked
collagen15. Collectively, the Loxl2 expression and inhibition data
indicate that Loxl2 expression activated by cardiac stress can
trigger interstitial fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction.
To assess how Loxl2 controlled ventricular function of stressed
hearts, we used a micro-admittance catheter to measure left
ventricular pressure–volume (PV) relationships of anaesthetized
mice in vivo. Analyses of mice after 10 weeks of TAC with 8
weeks of a-LOXL2 treatment showed that LV pressure overload
was comparable between the control IgG and a-LOXL2-treated
hearts (Supplementary Fig. 2c), but a-LOXL2 dramatically
reduced the left ventricular size and end-diastolic pressure
(EDP) of stressed hearts (Fig. 4h). a-LOXL2 improved ejection
fraction by 107% (Student’s t-test, Po0.01), stroke volume by
73% (Student’s t-test, P ¼ 0.01), stroke work by 48% (Student’s
t-test, P ¼ 0.01), and preload-adjusted maximal power (plPwr) by
78% (Student’s t-test, P ¼ 0.01; Fig. 4i–l). Strikingly, the stroke
work and plPwr were normalized (Fig. 4k,l), indicating that Loxl2
inhibition prevents stress-induced systolic abnormalities and
restores cardiac contractile function to the sham control level.
Consistent with the recovery of cardiac contractile work,
a-LOXL2 reduced the left ventricular end-systolic volume (ESV)
by 43% (Student’s t-test, Po0.001) and end-diastolic volume
(EDV) by 19% (Student’s t-test, Po0.01) (Fig. 4m,n). This led to
the elimination of TAC-induced enlargement of heart chamber at
end diastole, reducing the heart size to the sham control level
(Fig. 4n).

 Of note, the pressure overload by itself—without invoking
cardiomyopathy—is sufficient to increase ESV (but not EDV)
of a healthy heart, thus leading to a myopathy-independent,
mathematical reduction of EF, which equals (1 minus ESV/EDV).
Given this pressure effect, we concluded that the residual ESV
and EF changes of a-LOXL2-treated hearts are primarily the
result of persistent pressure load. This conclusion is supported by
the normalization of EDV, stroke work and contractile power of
a-LOXL2-treated hearts. Therefore, a-LOXL2 is capable of
decreasing stress-related cardiac dilatation and cardiac contractile
dysfunction.
In addition, a-LOXL2 normalized the diastolic function of
stressed hearts. In TAC-stressed hearts, myocardial relaxation
was impaired, and the left ventricles became stiff. The myocardial
relaxation
abnormalities
were
evident
by
an
increase
of
isovolumic relaxation time constant (Tau, 2.32-fold increase)

dp/dt, 24% reduction; Fig. 4o,p). Besides abnormal relaxation,
the TAC-stressed left ventricles were stiff, as shown by the
steep slopes of diastolic pressure–volume curves of stressed
hearts (Fig. 4q). The combination of slow relaxation and stiff
ventricles resulted in elevated left ventricular filling pressure or

 end-diastolic pressure (EDP), 3.83-fold over the control level
(Fig. 4r). Conversely, in a-LOXL2-treated, TAC-stressed hearts,
Tau was reduced by 81% (Student’s t-test, P ¼ 0.01) to levels not
significantly different from the controls (Fig. 4o). Also, EDP
was reduced by 74% (Student’s t-test, Po0.01), with near
normalization to the control level (Fig. 4r). Therefore, the
TAC-stressed hearts treated with a-LOXL2 had minimal fibrosis
(Fig. 4b,c) and compliant ventricles with essentially normal filling
pressure. The data indicate that Loxl2 is essential for the
development of interstitial fibrosis, ventricular stiffness and
diastolic dysfunction in pathologically stressed hearts.
The combined effects of a-LOXL2 on the systolic and diastolic
abnormalities resulted in 70% enhancement of cardiac output
(Student’s
t-test,
P ¼ 0.01;
Fig.
4s)
and
normalization
of
serum levels of cardiac stress marker (BNP) and fibrosis marker
(TIMP-1; Fig. 4t,u). Moreover, a-LOXL2-treated mice showed
a mortality rate of 20% over 30 weeks of observation, whereas
IgG-treated TAC mice had 70% mortality (Fig. 4v). Therefore,
a-LOXL2 is effective in protecting the hearts from stress-induced
failure.
Loxl2 knockout protects stress-induced cardiac dysfunction.
Next we asked whether Loxl2, among all Lox isoforms, played a
specific role in HF pathogenesis. To address that, we used
CRISPR/Cas9 and two-cut strategy to generate LoxP-flanked
(floxed) alleles of the mouse Loxl2 gene (Loxl2fl/fl) and then used
the Cre-Lox and tamoxifen-induction methods to exert genetic
knockout of Loxl2 at the desired time window (Supplementary
Fig. 3a). The LoxP sequences that flanked exon 8 and 9 of Loxl2,
once recognized and recombined by Cre recombinase, would
enable the deletion of the two exons, resulting in disruption of
gene regions encoding the SRCR and downstream catalytic
domains. The SRCR domain is the Loxl2 region targeted by
anti-LOXL2 (ref. 16; Supplementary Fig. 3a). The floxed alleles
were
genotyped
by
PCR
and
confirmed
by
sequencing
(Supplementary Fig. 3b,c). To delete Loxl2, we crossed Loxl2fl/fl

 mice to a driver mouse line that carried the transgene Actin-
CreERT. The expression of ActinCreERT is driven by the chicken
beta-actin promoter/enhancer coupled with the cytomegalovirus
immediate-early enhancer17, and its Cre recombinase (CreERT)
requires tamoxifen to activate the enzymatic function. The
ActinCreERT; Loxl2fl/fl genetic combination, therefore, allowed
us to use tamoxifen to induce global Loxl2 knockout in adult
mice, mimicking the systemic administration of anti-LOXL2. We
treated the mice with tamoxifen for 5 days to delete Loxl2 exon 8
and 9 from the genome (Supplementary Fig. 3d). Interestingly,
the Loxl2 mRNA that lacked exon 8 and 9 became destabilized
and could not be detected by qPCR primers that targeted either
deleted or non-deleted regions of the mRNA (Supplementary
Fig. 3e). Neither could fragments of Loxl2 proteins be detected by
western blotting using polyclonal antibodies (Supplementary
Fig. 3f). These findings indicate a complete loss of Loxl2 protein
in the knockout mice.
Male
mice
of
Loxl2-null
and
their
littermate
control
(ActinCreERT; Loxl2fl/ þ or Loxl2fl/fl, Loxl2fl/ þ) at 8–10 weeks of
age
were
then
subjected
to
TAC
and
followed
for
the
development of HF for 10 weeks (Fig. 5a). During the course,
there were no observable adverse effects of Loxl2 mutations on
the cardiac or gross functions of the mice, suggesting that Loxl2 is
dispensable for the baseline function of mice. However, Loxl2
knockout prevented TAC-induced cardiac interstitial fibrosis and
dysfunction (Fig. 5b–e), but no effects on myocyte hypertrophy
(Supplementary Fig. 4a). Interstitial fibrosis was essentially
eliminated (Fig. 5b), with 81% increase of cardiac FS (Fig. 5c)
and 24–36% reduction of LV dimensions measured by echo-
cardiography (Fig. 5d,e). Cardiac catheterization and PV loop
analysis further confirmed that Loxl2 deletion protected the heart
from TAC-induced chamber dilatation and functional decline.
After 10 weeks of TAC, the Loxl2-null mice (ActinCreERT;
Loxl2fl/fl) exhibited great improvement of cardiac mechanical
function (Fig. 5f). In Loxl2-null mice, the systolic function was
greatly improved: Cardiac EF was improved by 99%, plPwr
increased by 55% (normalized), ESV reduced by 42% and EDV
reduced by 63% (normalized; Fig. 5g–j). The diastolic function
was also greatly improved. EDP was reduced by 57%, Tau
reduced by 32% and the slope of diastolic PV curve reduced,
approaching the diastolic slope of compliant hearts (Fig. 5k–m).
Overall, the cardiac performance was greatly improved by
anti-LOXL2: SV increased by 63%, CO by 94% and SW by 61%
(normalized; Fig. 5n–p). Consistently, cardiac stress and fibrosis
gene markers—b-MHC, b/a-MHC ratio, Bnp, Timp-1, a-SMA,
Col1A, Col3A, Opn and Osf2—were much reduced and essentially
normalized in Loxl2-null hearts (Supplementary Fig. 4b,c). Taken
together, the genetic studies thus demonstrate a requirement of
Loxl2 in the development of HF.
To map the cellular site where Loxl2 functioned to trigger HF,
we performed tissue-specific knockout of Loxl2 in cardiac
fibroblasts, using the promoter of Tcf21—a transcription factor
specifically expressed in fibroblasts18—to drive the expression
of Cre recombinase (CreERT) whose enzymatic activity is
inducible by tamoxifen (iTcf21CreERT; Supplementary Fig.5a,b).
Fibroblast-specific deletion of Loxl2 can therefore be executed
in
iTcf21CreERT;Loxl2fl/fl
mice
treated
with
tamoxifen
(Supplementary Fig. 5c). By the end of 10 weeks after TAC,
mice without Loxl2 in cardiac fibroblasts exhibited fractional
shortening (FS) 67% higher than that of mice expressing Loxl2 in
fibroblasts (Fig. 5q,r). The magnitude of FS improvement in mice
lacking fibroblast Loxl2 is comparable to that of anti-LOXL2
therapy and to that of global Loxl2 knockout at the corresponding
time window (Figs 4a and 5a). These observations indicate a
crucial role of Loxl2 secreted by fibroblasts in HF pathogenesis.
LOXL2 promotes TGF-b2 production through the PI3K path.
Although a-LOXL2 and LOXL2 specific gene deletion essentially
eliminated interstitial fibrosis and ventricular stiffness, it had only
marginal effect on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (Fig. 4g and
Supplementary
Fig.
4a).
The
uncoupling
of
myocyte
hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis suggests that LOXL2 provides
a
myocyte-independent,
interstitial
mechanism
to
control
stress-induced matrix modifications. In the interstitium of
stressed hearts, TGF-b provides the primary signal to trigger
the transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, which
then migrate to and deposit collagen in stressed areas of
the heart4,5,15,19–26. To test whether LOXL2 was required for
TGF-b-induced
cardiac
myofibroblast
transformation,
we
knocked down LOXL2 and examined TGF-b activity in the
primary human cardiac ventricular fibroblasts. Human cardiac
fibroblasts contained abundant LOXL2, and LOXL2-targeted
siRNA effectively removed LOXL2 from these cells (Fig. 6a).

Quantification of TGF-b ligands revealed that the human
cardiac fibroblasts secreted primarily TGF-b2 and that LOXL2
was required for TGF-b2 production. Without LOXL2, the
TGF-b2 ligand secreted by fibroblasts was reduced by B50%
(Student’s t-test, Po0.0001; Fig. 6b), accompanied by reduced
expression of TGF-b target genes, COL1A, FN1 and a-SMA
(Fig. 6c) that are characteristic markers of myofibroblasts27.
Consistent with the results from LOXL2 knockdown experiments,

 but not TGF-b1 or TGF-b3 production in the culture media
(Supplementary Fig. 6a). Interestingly, LOXL2 increased TGF-b2
protein production without significant effect on TGF-b2 mRNA
expression (Supplementary Fig. 6b), suggesting that LOXL2
regulates TGF-b2 at the translation level. Given that the
PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 signalling pathway is known to regulate
translation and promote heart failure28,29, we tested whether
LOXL2 functioned through the PI3K path to enhance TGF-b2
translation. We found that LOXL2 overexpression in human
cardiac fibroblasts increased AKT phosphorylation at serine 473
and threonine 308, without changing total AKT amount (Fig. 6d).
LOXL2 also increased phosphorylation of the mTORC1 target
protein S6K and 4E-BP1 without changing their total protein
levels (Fig. 6d). Notably, PI3Ka (but not PI3b, PI3Kg or PI3Kd)
knockdown
or
inhibition
decreased
LOXL2-induced
AKT/
mTORC1 signalling and reduced TGF-b2 protein level in the
culture media (Supplementary Fig. 6c–f). These results suggested
that LOXL2 activates PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 signalling in cardiac
fibroblasts. Such PI3K activation by LOXL2 was required for
TGF-b2 production. PI3K and mTORC1 inhibition not only
blocked TGF-b2 signalling activation (Fig. 6d), but also prevented
the LOXL2-induced TGF-b2 production (Fig. 6e).
We also measured TGF-b2 level in heart tissues by western
blotting after 6 weeks of TAC with or without antibody treatment.
We found that cardiac TGF-b2 level increased by B2.5-folds in
TAC-stressed hearts, whereas in a-LOXL2-treated TAC hearts,
such stress-induced change of TGF-b2 was reduced by 55%
(Student’s t-test, P ¼ 0.03) to levels not significantly different
from the controls (Fig. 6f,g). Consistent with the antibody
treatment data, in TAC-stressed Loxl2-null hearts, the target
genes of TGF-b—a-SMA, Col1A and Col3A—were reduced to
normal level (Supplementary Fig. 4c). These in vivo data are
consistent with the ability of Loxl2 to stimulate production of
TGF-b2 in fibroblasts. Collectively, these results indicate a
signalling cascade from LOXL2 to PI3Ka/AKT/mTORC1 and
then to TGF-b2 to stimulate cardiac fibrosis (Fig. 6h).
LOXL2 controls myofibroblast transformation and migration.
The regulation of myofibroblast marker expression by LOXL2
suggested that LOXL2 was required for fibroblasts to transform
into myofibroblasts. To test that, we examined fibroblast cell
morphology in cell culture. Myofibroblasts are morphologically
large and polygonal, whereas fibroblasts are slender and spindle-
shaped30.
Under
cell
culture
conditions,
human
cardiac
fibroblasts
produced
TGF-b2
and
displayed
morphological
features of the large, polygonal myofibroblasts (Fig. 6i). In
contrast,
LOXL2-deficient
fibroblasts,
with
reduced
TGF-b
signalling and a-SMA expression (Fig. 6b,c), were slender and
spindle-shaped (Fig. 6i), consistent with a lack of myofibroblast
transformation. Therefore, both the marker and cell morphology
studies indicate that LOXL2 promotes the formation of cardiac
myofibroblasts, which are critical for the development of
ventricular fibrosis2,4,5. This conclusion is further supported by
the
observation
that
LOXL2
inhibition
nearly
eradicated
myofibroblast-dependent
Col1A
deposition
and
fibrosis
in
TAC-stressed mouse hearts (Figs 4b and 6j).
In the stressed hearts, the newly formed myofibroblasts migrate
to the stressed or hypertrophic region, where the myofibroblasts
produce collagen-rich matrix, causing ventricular fibrosis2,4,5.
Given
that
myofibroblast
migration
requires
TGF-b
signals27,31–33, we tested whether LOXL2 was essential for
controlling myofibroblast migration using a gap closure assay.
Human ventricular fibroblasts were seeded onto collagen I-coated
plates, and the cell monolayer was scratched to create a cell-free
zone or gap on the plate (Fig. 6k). The cells were then treated with
TGF-b2 to stimulate cell migration into the gap (Fig. 6k). In this
assay, TGF-b2 enhanced the number of cells migrating into the
gap by B3-fold, whereas a-LOXL2 completely blocked such
effect
of
TGF-b2
(Fig.
6l).
Because
TGF-b2
was
added
exogenously in the assay, the inhibition of cell migration by
a-LOXL2 was not a result of inadequate TGF-b2 secretion
(Fig. 6b). LOXL2 inhibition likely changed collagen crosslinking
and the microstructure of the extracellular matrix to inhibit
fibroblast migration. Collectively, the in vitro and in vivo studies
indicate that LOXL2 is a crucial molecule activated by cardiac
stress to transform and mobilize fibroblasts, triggering collagen
synthesis, crosslinking and myofibroblast migration, thereby
causing diffuse interstitial fibrosis and ventricular dysfunction
(Fig. 7).
Discussion
Cardiac interstitial fibrosis is a major cause of systolic and
diastolic abnormalities2–6 and a strong predictor of the clinical
outcomes of patients with HF across a wide spectrum of disease
severity6. However, the fibrotic process has not been a direct
therapeutic target for HF. In patients with HF, LOXL2 levels are
elevated in heart tissues and serum, its levels correlating with
cardiac dysfunction and HF biomarker levels. In mice, LOXL2
activation is essential for cardiac fibrosis and HF development.
The genetic or pharmacological inhibition of LOXL2 greatly
reduces cardiac fibrosis and halts HF progression. The human
sample and animal efficacy studies, in combination, suggest a
pathogenic role of LOXL2 in cardiac fibrosis and human HF.
Our studies therefore delineate a novel LOXL2-mediated HF
mechanism and provide new insights into HF therapy.
In mechanically stressed hearts, LOXL2 expression is activated
in the fibroblasts, which then release LOXL2 proteins into the
interstitial space, particularly in the hypertrophic area where the
mechanical stress is highest (Fig. 7). This suggests that LOXL2
activation is a response of cardiac fibroblasts to enhanced
mechanical stress to maintain structural integrity of the heart.
Indeed, LOXL2 elevation has multiple biological effects that

 promote interstitial collagen formation. LOXL2 not only triggers
myofibroblast transformation to enhance collagen production
(through PI3K-AKT-mTOR and TGF-b), but also augments
collagen strength (by crosslinking collagen fibres). LOXL2 also
stimulates myofibroblasts migration to large areas of the heart,
where these cells produce collagen fibres. Collagen fibres, once
released into the interstitial space, are crosslinked by LOXL2 to
form bundles of collagen that are much stiffer than isolated
collagen fibres. Furthermore, activated fibroblasts secrete more
LOXL2 and collagen, creating a positive feedback loop to sustain
the fibrotic process. All these factors, in combination, trigger
diffuse interstitial fibrosis of pathologically stressed hearts.
The LOXL2-mediated stress reaction, although capable of
reinforcing tissue strength in the face of increased mechanical
stress, is ultimately maladaptive. Excessive amount of collagen
fibres in cardiac interstitial space impede coronary vasodilation,
oxygen diffusion and electromechanical coordination between
cardiomyocytes, causing contractile abnormalities (systolic pump
dysfunction)34. Meanwhile, the increase of collagen and its
crosslinking stiffens the left ventricle, impairing ventricular
relaxation
and
filling
(diastolic
pump
dysfunction)35,36.
Therefore, the LOXL2-mediated interstitial reaction leads to
both systolic and diastolic abnormalities, revealing a novel
therapeutic avenue for HF. The diastolic aspect of LOXL2
effects is particularly important, given the recognition and
increasing prevalence of diastolic dysfunction as part of HF
syndrome and the lack of approved therapy for HFpEF with
primarily diastolic failure.
Although LOXL2 can interact with TGF-b in models of cancer
and bone remodelling14,37, the roles of LOXL2 gene in HF have
not been demonstrated in mouse genetic models in vivo. By
generating a new LOXL2 genetic model with fibroblast-specific
LOXL2 knockout, we showed crucial roles of LOXL2 in cardiac
fibroblasts for stress-induced interstitial fibrosis and cardiac
dysfunction. What remains unanswered is how LOXL2-mediated
changes of extracellular collagen composition affect TGF-b
processing and signalling and guide the cellular process of
myofibroblast migration. Given that LOXL2 is transcriptionally
activated in the stressed hearts, it will be essential to know what
factors control the expression of LOXL2 gene in the hearts. Gene

 expression regulation can occur at the chromatin, transcription or
posttranscriptional level, mediated respectively by epigenetic
factors (chromatin-regulating factors, long noncoding RNAs),
transcription factors and microRNAs. Understanding LOXL2
regulation will provide an opportunity to integrate cardiac fibrosis
with epigenetics and RNA mechanisms of HF and to identify
additional new targets for HF therapy.
Methods
Animal sample size and randomization. Littermate CD1 male mice were pur-
chased from Charles River (Strain Code: 022). ActinCreERT (ref. 17) and
Rosa-mT/mG (ref. 38) mice were purchased from Jackson Lab. iTcf21CreERT
(ref. 18) was provided by Dr Michelle D. Tallquist at the University of Hawaii and
Dr Eric Olson at the UT Southwestern. Loxl2fl/ þ mice were generated by the
Chang Lab. The number of animals used (n) was denoted in each test in the figures,
including technical replicates when applicable. Each subgroup of experiments had
n ¼ 8 to 10 biological replicates, many of which had technical replicates of three.
The mice were randomly selected from the cage and assigned to different control
and experimental subgroups as described in the text. The control and experimental
groups are blinded to the operators of echocardiography, catheterization and heart
tissue analyses. The use of mice for studies was in compliance with the regulations
of Indiana University and National Institute of Health.
Study population and analysis of human heart samples. The patients
presenting at the Charite
´ University Medicine Berlin with heart failure symptoms
and reduced exercise capacity despite preserved LVEF (450%; heart failure
with preserved ejection fraction, HFpEF) who showed diastolic dysfunction
according to echocardiographic analysis and European Society of Cardiology
recommendations13 were enrolled in the study (n ¼ 24) (Table 2). All the patients
were evaluated by echocardiography, invasive angiography, 6-min walk test and
NT-proBNP. The patients without symptoms and signs of congestive heart failure
but with atypical angina or intermittent arrhythmias who underwent right
ventricular (RV) biopsy for evaluation of cardiomyopathy and showed regular
systolic and diastolic LV function were enrolled as controls (n ¼ 15; Table 2).
Endomyocardial biopsies were obtained from the RV septum as previously
described35. Collagen volume fraction was analysed with collagen-specific
Picrosirius red. Crosslinking was calculated as the ratio of insoluble to soluble
collagen forms by a colorimetric approach in nine control subjects and 14 HFpEF
patients39. Immunohistochemical staining was performed in heart tissues of
adequate quality and quantity35. Other heart tissue samples used for LOXL2
immunostaining and for LOXL2, COL1A and COL3A mRNA quantification were
derived from patients with ischaemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and
from heart transplantation donors that did not have heart failure (Table 1). The use
of human subjects or tissue samples was in compliance with the regulations of
Charite
´ University, Gilead Sciences and Indiana University.
Biomarker analysis in heart failure patients. Serum LOXL2 was measured using
customized RUO LOXL2 kits (bioMe
´rieux) on Vitek Immuno Diagnostic Assay
System (VIDAS) platform. The plasma concentrations of ST-2 and tissue inhibitor
of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) were determined using ELISA kits obtained from
R&D Systems and NT-proBNP was measured using a Luminex kit from EMD
Millipore following manufacturers’ instructions. The serum level of cardiac
troponin I was measured using Simoa cTnI assay (Quanterix Corp).
Antibody production and purification. Hybridoma cells expressing anti-LOXL2
(AB0023) antibody were transferred to Aragen Bioscience (Gilroy, CA, USA) for
the production of ascites fluid in BALB/c mice. Ascites fluid was then purified by
batch mode on MabSelect resin and dialysed into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
with 0.01% Tween 20. Purified AB0023 was then tested in multiple assays for
release. The control IgG1 antibody directed against a non-naturally occurring
protein was purchased from Antibody Solutions (Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
Transaortic constriction. Surgeries were adapted from ref. 40 and were performed
on CD1 male mice of 6–8 weeks of age, and Loxl2 genetic male mice of 8–10 weeks
of age and between 20 and 25 grams of weight. The mice were anaesthetized with
isoflurane (2–3%, inhalation) in an induction chamber and then intubated with a
20-gauge intravenous catheter and ventilated with a mouse ventilator (Minivent,
Harvard Apparatus, Inc). Anaesthesia was maintained with inhaled isoflurane
(1–2%). A longitudinal 5-mm incision of the skin was made with scissors at
midline of sternum. The chest cavity was opened by a small incision at the level of
the second intercostal space 2–3 mm from the left sternal border. The chest
retractor was gently inserted to spread the wound 4–5 mm in width. The transverse
portion of the aorta was bluntly dissected with curved forceps. Then, 6-0 silk was
brought underneath the transverse aorta between the left common carotid artery
and the brachiocephalic trunk. One 26-gauge needle was placed directly above and
parallel to the aorta. A loop was then tied around the aorta and needle, and secured
with a second knot. The needle was immediately removed to create a lumen with
a fixed stenotic diameter. The chest cavity was closed by 6-0 silk suture. The
sham-operated mice underwent similar surgical procedures, including isolation of
the aorta, looping of aorta, but without tying of the suture. The pressure load
caused by TAC was verified by the pressure gradient across the aortic constriction
measured by echocardiography. Only mice with a peak pressure gradient
430 mm Hg were analysed for cardiac hypertrophy and gene expression.
Echocardiography. The echocardiographer was blinded to the genotypes, surgical
or pharmacological treatment of the mice tested. Transthoracic ultrasonography
with a GE Vivid 9 ultrasound platform (GE Health Care, Milwaukee, WI, USA)
and a 13 MHz transducer was used to measure aortic pressure gradient and left
ventricular function. To minimize the confounding influence of different heart
rates on aortic pressure gradient and left ventricular function, the flow of isoflurane
(inhalational) was adjusted to anaesthetize the mice while maintaining their heart
rates at 450–550 beats per minute. The peak aortic pressure gradient was measured
by continuous wave Doppler across the aortic constriction. The left ventricular
function was assessed by the M-mode scanning of the left ventricular chamber,
standardized by two-dimensional, short-axis views of the left ventricle at the mid
papillary muscle level. The fractional shortening (FS) of the left ventricle was
defined as 100% � (1 � end-systolic/end-diastolic diameter), representing the
relative change of left ventricular diameters during the cardiac cycle. The mean
FS of the left ventricle was determined by the average of FS measurement of the
left ventricular contraction over five beats. The P values were calculated by the
Student’s-t test. The error bars indicate standard error of mean.
In vivo catheterization. The trachea was exposed by a midline incision from the
base of the throat to just above the clavicle. The mice were intubated with a piece of
polyethylene-90 tube. After the tube was secured in place by using a 6-0 silk suture,
100% oxygen was gently blown across the opening. The mice receiving ventilation
were placed on a warmed (37 �C) pad. The right carotid artery was then isolated.
Care was taken to prevent damage to the vagal nerve. The mice were lightly
anaesthetized with isoflurane maintaining their heart rates at 450–550 beats per
minute. A 1.2F Pressure-Volume Catheter (FTE-1212B-4518, Scisense, Inc) was
inserted into the right carotid artery and then advanced into the left ventricle. The
transducer was securely tied into place, after it was advanced to the ventricular
chamber as evidenced by a change in pressure curves. The hemodynamic
parameters were then recorded in close-chest mode. The parameters include left
ventricular systolic pressure, EF, plPwr, stroke volume, stroke work, ESV, EDV,
Tau, EDP and cardiac output.

The T7-sgRNA PCR product was gel purified and used as the template for
in vitro transcription using MEGAshortscript T7 kit (Life Technologies).
We first tested the cleavage efficiency of sgRNAs at the genomic target site.
Capped polyadenylated Cas9 mRNA (Sigma-Aldrich; 100 ng ml � 1) was
co-injected with sgRNAs (50 ng ml � 1) into pronuclear (PN) stage one-cell mouse
embryos and assessed the frequency of altered alleles (insertions and deletions) at
the blastocyst stage using PCR assay with following primer sets.

Both sgRNAs achieved over 50% indel at the genomic target site. Plasmid-based
donor repair templates that contain homology arms (980 bp length on each side)
and 50 and 30 LoxP sequences at denoted sites (Supplementary Fig. 3) were cloned
to the TOPO-Blunt vector (Thermo Fisher) and verified by sequencing. Cas9
mRNA (100 ng ml � 1), 50-sgRNA (50 ng ml � 1), 30-sgRNA (50 ng ml � 1) and donor
circular dsDNA (100 ng ml � 1) were mixed and injected into the cytoplasm of
fertilized eggs with well-recognized pronuclei in the M2 media (Sigma-Aldrich).
Injected zygotes were cultured in KSOM (media for in vitro embryo culture,
MR-121-D, EMD Millipore) with amino acids at 37�C and 5% CO2 after the
two-cell stage and were then transplanted to pseudopregnant CD1 females. Three
out of 23 mice were genotyped positive with 50 and 30 LoxP insertion using the
upstream PCR primer set 1 (product size 1,069 bp) and the downstream primer set
2 (product size 1,082 bp).

These three founder mice were grossly normal and heterozygous as
determined by additional PCR primer sets—Loxl2-50sg-test F and R (primer set 3),
as well as Loxl2-30sg-test F and R (primer set 4; sequences shown above;
Supplementary Fig. 3). Founder mice were then crossed to C57BL6 mice.
Genotyping of the offspring mice using PCR primers described above showed
that two of the founder mice carried the template transgene ectopically in the
genome in addition to the LoxP target insertions (primer set 3, 4 positive,
but negative for primer set 1, 2). To genetically remove the ectopic insertions
of the template transgenes, we back-crossed the founder mice C57BL6 mice for
three to five generations. This process also helped wash out potential off-targets
of sgRNA (off-target effects were rare in mice generated by microinjection
using CRISPR/Cas9 into mouse zygotes42,43.) According to genotyping and
Mendelian ratio, one male heterozygous Loxl2fl/ þ was selected to cross with
ActinCreERT and iTcf21CreERT female mice for knockout studies. Throughout
the observation period of current studies, all homozygous, heterozygous and
wild-type offspring mice were grossly normal and non-distinguishable from their
littermates.
Western blot analysis. The blots were reacted with antibodies of anti-LOXL2
(1:500, ab96233, Abcam), anti-TGF-b2 (1:1,000, MAB73461, R&D Systems),

and PI3Kd (1:1,000, D55D5, Cell Signaling). Then followed by HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA,
USA). Chemiluminescence was detected with ECL Western blot detection kits (GE)
with LI-COR odyssey image system. Uncropped blot images are shown in
Supplementary Fig. 7.
RT–qPCR. RT–qPCR reactions were performed using SYBR green master mix
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) with an Eppendorf realplex, and the primer sets
were tested to be quantitative. Threshold cycles and melting curve measurements
were performed with software. The P values were calculated by the Student’s t-test.
Error bars indicate standard error of mean.
Histology and trichrome staining. Staining for LOXL2 and COL1A was
performed on frozen 5 mm-thick sections of human endomyocardial biopsies.
Rabbit anti-LOXL2 (1:250, Gilead Sciences) and anti-COL1A antibody (1:75,
BT 21-5000-20, Biotrend Chemikalien, Germany) were used as primary antibodies,
followed by secondary EnVision anti-rabbit antibody (Dako, Germany) according
to manufacturer’s instructions. Visualization was performed with carbazol-staining
solution and background staining was performed with a Mayer’s hemalum solution
(Sigma-Aldrich, Germany). Digital image analysis was conducted on a Leica
DMRB microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany) at a � 200 magnification.
As described previously44, adult mice hearts were fixed overnight in 4%
paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Subsequently, they were
dehydrated through an ethanol series, treated with xylenes and embedded in
paraffin wax overnight with several changes. The hearts were oriented for
transverse sections and cut in 7 mm sections using a Leica microtome. Trichrome
staining was performed following the protocol of trichrome stain (Masson) kit
(HT15) from Sigma-Aldrich. Deparaffinize the slides to deionized water, then
mordant in preheated Bouin’s Solution (HT10-1) at 56 �C for 15 min. Cool the
slides in tap water (18–26 �C) and wash in running tap water to remove yellow
colour from sections. Put the slides in Working Weigert’s Iron Haematoxylin
Solution for 5 min, Biebrich Scarlet-Acid Fucshin (HT15–1) 5 min, working
Phosphotungstic/Phosphomolybdic Acid Solution for 5 min, Aniline Blue Solution
(HT15–4) for 5 min, 1% acetic acid for 2 min. Finally, rinse slides, dehydrate
through alcohol, clear in xylene and mount. The imaging was performed using
Leica microscope. The following primary antibodies were used for mice tissue
immunostaining: anti-LOXL2 (1:100, Rabbit Polyclonal antibody, Gilead Sciences),
anti-CD4 (1:100, sc-13573, Santa Cruz), anti-COL1A (Chemicon, MA, USA) and
a–SMA (1:200, A2547, Sigma-Aldrich). Immunohistochemistry was conducted
using biotinylated secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit IgG, 1:250; anti-mice IgG,
1:250; Jackson Immunoresearch), VECTASTAIN Elite ABC Kit (PK-6200, Vector
Laboratories) and DAB developing reagents (DAKO). Imaging was performed
using a Leica microscope.
Collagen content measurements. To determine total cardiac collagen content,
we measured the content of hydroxyproline, a major component of collagen,
as described39. Left ventricles were hydrolysed in hydrochloric acid HCl, and
hydroxyproline level was measured by a colorimetric method using assay kits from
Qickzyme. The total collagen content was calculated from the hydroxyproline
content of collagen standards. To determine soluble collagen content, left ventricles
were solubilized in pepsin-acid solution, and the supernatants were precipitated by
trichloroacetic acid solution. Dried pellets were then hydrolysed in HCl, and
hydroxyproline measured. The soluble collagen content was calculated from the
hydroxyproline content of collagen standards. The insoluble collagen content was
determined by subtracting the amount of soluble collagen from total collagen.
LOXL2 siRNA knockdown in human primary cardiac fibroblasts. Human
primary cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from the ventricles (Lonza, Walkersville
Inc., Walkersville, MD, USA; CC-2904). These cells were cultured in FGM-2
BulletKits media (Lonza, CC-4526) at 37 �C and 5% CO2. Human LOXL2 and
control siRNA (Qiagen, SI00036134 and SI03650318) were transfected into human
fibroblasts with lipfectmain RNAiMAX. After 48 h, the cells were collected, culture
media collected, cells lysed and total RNA extracted for further analyses. The levels
of mRNA were measured by RT–qPCR using primers for individual genes or
TGF-b/BMP signalling arrays (Qiagen). The siRNA for LOXL2 was 50-CCGGAG
TTGCCTGCTCAGAAA-30. Primers for human LOXL2 (QT00019425), TGF-b1
(QT00000728), TGF-b2 (QT00025718) and TGF-b3 (QT00001302) were from
Qiagen. The levels of TGF-b in the culture media were measured with Milliplex
Map TGF-b 3-Plex (EMD Millipore).
LOXL2 overexpression in human primary cardiac fibroblasts. Adenoviral
vectors expressing human LOXL2 or GFP were purchased from Applied Biological
Materials. Human cardiac fibroblasts were transduced with adenovirus for 6 h,
and the cells were cultured in FGM-2 medium with 2% FBS for 48 h and culture
medium, cell lysates and total RNA were isolated for measuring mRNA and TGF-b
levels.
Gap closure assay. A gap closure assay was used to study the migration of human
ventricular fibroblasts (Lonza Walkersville Inc., Walkersville, MD, USA). The cells
were seeded into collagen I-coated 24-well plates (Life Technologies Corporation,
Grand Island, NY, USA) at the density of 105 cm � 2 cells. The culture was grown
to high confluency, and then the cells were serum-starved for 24 h before the
treatment. The cell monolayer was scratched with a sterile pipette tip to remove
cells and create a gap. The average width of the scratch was 876±38 mm.

 The culture medium was replaced with fresh media immediately after scratching.
The anti-LOXL2 antibody (AB0023) was added at a concentration of 10 mg ml � 1,
and the cell migration was activated with TGF-b2 (5 ng ml � 1). A mouse IgG1
antibody was used as an isotype control. The fibroblasts were allowed to migrate
into the gap for approximately 16 h. After that, the cells were loaded with
fluorescent dye calcein AM (0.2 mM, Life Technologies Corporation) at 37 �C for
30 min. Once the dye loading was completed, fluorescence images were acquired
using Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal confocal microscope equipped with � 4 objective.
Calcein fluorescence was excited with an Argon laser at 488 nm and detected at
wavelengths 4505 nm using a long pass filter. To count the migrated cells, the
images were analysed using Image J (NIH) software.
Statistical analysis. Comparisons were performed with the Mann–Whitney
U-test used for non-parametric continuous variables or the Student’s t-test for
parametric variables and Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. Correlation of
parameters was performed with Pearson or Spearman coefficients, and regression
analysis was used for exact relations. Statistical significances were calculated using
GraphPad Prism 5 and 7 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). A value of
Po0.05 was considered statistically significant.
