randomized trial of immunotherapy with or 
without stereotactic radiosurgery in appropri-
ate patients. We also contend that these results 
further reinforce the case for careful screening 
of high-risk, early-stage disease to detect small-
volume CNS relapse with the use of magnetic 
resonance imaging. Finally, a better under-
standing of the mechanisms of metastatic 
spread of melanoma to the brain and of the 
unique CNS immune microenvironment is nec-
essary to further improve the outcomes of 
these patients. Translational studies that facili-
tate tissue sampling after death (e.g., the PEACE 
[Posthumous Evaluation of Advanced Cancer 
Environment] Study; ClinicalTrials.gov number, 
NCT03004755) could play a critical role in inform-
ing this understanding.
What is the broader relevance of these data? 
Unquestionably, they show that checkpoint inhibi-
tors can be as efficacious for CNS metastases as 
they are for extracranial metastases from mela-
noma. Therefore, we would recommend addi-
tional, larger trials involving patients with CNS 
metastases not just from melanoma but also 
from kidney, lung, and other cancers in which 
checkpoint inhibitors are active. Such patients 
should no longer generally be excluded from 
clinical trials.

Finding Better Ways to Prevent Postpartum Hemorrhage
Haleema Shakur‑Still, M.Sc., and Ian Roberts, Ph.D.
Postpartum hemorrhage is the leading cause of 
maternal death in low-income countries.1 Al-
though moderate bleeding after childbirth is not 
problematic in most healthy mothers, it can be 
life-threatening in mothers with clinically sig-
nificant anemia, and severe bleeding can be 
rapidly fatal. Prevention of excessive postpartum 
bleeding is essential.
The administration of drugs to contract the 
uterus (uterotonic agents) immediately after de-
livery is the cornerstone of strategies to prevent 
excessive postpartum bleeding.2 The uterine 
smooth muscle is believed to act as a living liga-
ture that compresses bleeding blood vessels, 
stemming the flow of blood. Although there are 
remarkably few high-quality trials comparing 
oxytocin with placebo,3 oxytocin has become the 
standard uterotonic agent and is widely recom-
mended in guidelines.2 However, oxytocin is heat-
sensitive and loses potency in hot climates.
This issue of the Journal includes reports of 
two landmark randomized trials of strategies to 
prevent postpartum bleeding. The Carbetocin 
Haemorrhage Prevention (CHAMPION) trial, 
conducted by Widmer et al.,4 was a randomized, 
noninferiority trial evaluating the intramuscular 
injection of oxytocin as compared with carbeto-
cin, a synthetic analogue of oxytocin that does 
not require cold-chain transport and cold stor-
age,5 immediately after vaginal delivery. The trial

had two primary outcomes: the proportion of 
women with blood loss of at least 500 ml or the 
use of additional uterotonic agents, and the pro-
portion of women with blood loss of at least 
1000 ml. According to the protocol, the first 
outcome was the criterion for regulatory ap-
proval, whereas the second was for evaluating 
clinical effectiveness and for the potential inclu-
sion of heat-stable carbetocin in future World 
Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and the 
Model List of Essential Medicines.
Noninferiority was shown for the first but not 
the second primary outcome. Despite the inclu-
sion of nearly 30,000 women, because the preva-
lence of blood loss of at least 1000 ml was lower 
than expected, the trial was underpowered for 
the evaluation of this outcome. It will be impor-
tant for the WHO guideline development group 
to consider the trial results as a whole and in the 
context of all available evidence regarding the 
safety, cost-effectiveness, and affordability of 
heat-stable carbetocin. Widmer et al. note that 
Ferring Pharmaceuticals and Merck have an 
agreement with the WHO to make heat-stable 
carbetocin available in “public sector facilities of 
high-burden countries at an affordable and sus-
tainable price.” What this really means is un-
clear. The agreement ought to be made publicly 
available so that its implications for mothers 
everywhere can be considered. The efficacy and 
safety of carbetocin therapy for labor induction 
and postpartum hemorrhage are still unclear, 
and oxytocin is still indicated for these purpos-
es, pending the availability of more data.
The second trial reported in this issue of the 
Journal, which was conducted by Sentilhes et al.,6 
had the same objective but targeted a different 
biologic mechanism. Tranexamic acid reduces 
bleeding by inhibiting the enzymatic breakdown 
of fibrin blood clots.7 It is widely used in surgery 
to reduce the incidence of blood transfusion, 
and early administration reduces the risk of 
death due to bleeding among patients with trau-
ma.8,9 Tranexamic acid is heat-stable, inexpensive, 
and widely available and has a long shelf life.10,11 
The World Maternal Antifibrinolytic (WOMAN) 
trial, for which we were investigators, showed 
that the early administration of tranexamic acid 
led to a lower risk of death due to bleeding than 
placebo among women with postpartum hemor-
rhage and had an acceptable safety profile.12 The 
treatment was similarly effective when bleeding 
was attributable to uterine atony.12 However, for 
many women in low- and middle-income coun-
tries, treatment comes too late. Most mothers in 
such countries have anemia, and many have se-
vere anemia. In these women, postpartum bleed-
ing is likely to be dangerous, leading to exsan-
guination within hours after delivery. Could the 
prophylactic use of tranexamic acid reduce the 
risk of postpartum hemorrhage?
The Tranexamic Acid for Preventing Postpar-
tum Hemorrhage Following a Vaginal Delivery 
(TRAAP) trial enrolled more than 4000 women 
with a planned vaginal delivery of a singleton 
live fetus at 35 weeks or more of gestation who 
were at low risk for postpartum hemorrhage. 
Participants were randomly assigned to receive 
1 g of tranexamic acid or matching placebo, 
administered by intravenous infusion immedi-
ately after the administration of oxytocin. The 
use of tranexamic acid did not result in a risk of 
the primary outcome — blood loss of at least 
500 ml — that was significantly lower than the 
risk with placebo (relative risk, 0.83; 95% confi-
dence interval, 0.68 to 1.01; P 
= 
0.07). There were 
significantly lower rates of provider-assessed clin-
ically significant postpartum hemorrhage and 
receipt of additional uterotonic agents in the 
tranexamic acid group than in the placebo group, 
but such results were not observed with regard 
to other bleeding-associated outcomes. The rates 
of nausea and vomiting were higher in the 
tranexamic acid group than in the placebo group. 
Although this trial was larger than previous 
trials of tranexamic acid for the prevention of 
postpartum hemorrhage, it cannot rule out a 
modest but clinically important treatment bene-
fit, particularly in women at high risk for post-
partum hemorrhage.
In summary, the results of the CHAMPION 
trial suggest that carbetocin can be used for the 
prevention of postpartum hemorrhage in situa-
tions in which maintaining a cold chain is dif-
ficult. However, its effects have not yet been 
studied in other scenarios in which oxytocin is 
used, and it will be critical to ensure that car-
betocin is truly affordable and sustainable. As 
for tranexamic acid therapy, the TRAAP trial did 
not show a significantly lower incidence of post-
partum hemorrhage with the active drug than 
with placebo, and at this point we would not

recommend its use to prevent postpartum hem-
orrhage; larger trials involving women at high risk 
for postpartum hemorrhage will be useful in de-
termining its value in prevention. The WOMAN-2 
trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03475342), 
which we are investigators for, is planned to 
quantify the effect of tranexamic acid therapy on 
postpartum hemorrhage and other maternal out-
comes in 10,000 women with moderate or severe 
anemia.
