 chemical modification known to inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis, could be potentially used for 
treatment of T2D. Thus, we designed a high-throughput chemical screen platform to quantify 
PGC-1α acetylation in cells and identified small molecules that increase PGC-1α acetylation, 
suppress gluconeogenic gene expression and reduce glucose production in hepatocytes. Based on 
the potency and bioavailability, we selected a small molecule, SR-18292, that reduces blood 
glucose, strongly increases hepatic insulin sensitivity and improves glucose homeostasis in dietary 
and genetic mouse models of T2D. These studies have important implications for understanding 
the regulatory mechanisms of glucose metabolism and treatment of T2D.

Introduction
T2D has become a worldwide epidemic that affected over 400 million people in 2014 
according to the World Health Organization. Uncontrolled increased blood glucose 
concentration is a hallmark of T2D which can lead to long term complications including 
micro-and macro-cardiovascular complications, neuropathy, kidney failure and increased 
risk for developing cancer (Forbes and Cooper, 2013; Richardson and Pollack, 2005). 
Maintaining blood glucose within a normal range is the foremost objective in the treatment 
of T2D, as this dramatically reduces the risk of developing diabetes-associated 
complications (Holman et al., 2008; Kahn et al., 2014). Several drugs are currently being 
used for treatment of T2D in the clinic; these include primarily metformin, the first line drug 
used to treat T2D, but also sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), incretin mimetics and 
sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (Bailey, 2013; Kahn et al., 2014). As 
most patients develop resistance to metformin treatment over time, a strategy of combination 
therapy that includes treatment with an additional drug or insulin administration is

 commonly employed (Bailey, 2013). This highlights the need for developing additional 
drugs to reduce hyperglycemia that can be used either as a monotherapy or as part of a 
combination therapy.
Whole body glucose homeostasis is achieved through an intricate balance between glucose 
production, mostly by the liver, and glucose uptake by peripheral tissues (DeFronzo, 2004; 
Moore et al., 2012). This is regulated primarily through the opposing pancreatic hormones 
insulin and glucagon. In diabetic states, the liver becomes resistant to the action of insulin 
and produces an elevated amount of glucose which is a major contributor to the increased 
blood glucose levels observed in T2D (Rizza, 2010). Hence, reducing HGP is a feasible 
strategy to manage blood glucose levels in T2D. Importantly, increased HGP in T2D was 
shown to be primarily a result of dysregulated gluconeogenesis rather than glycogen 
breakdown (Magnusson et al., 1992), suggesting that targeting components within the 
gluconeogenic pathway could improve hyperglycemia. Indeed, metformin is believed to 
exert its effect mainly by reducing hepatic gluconeogenesis (Hundal et al., 2000; Madiraju et 
al., 2014).
The transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α plays a pivotal role in energy homeostasis by co-
activating transcription factors that regulate fat and glucose metabolism (Finck and Kelly, 
2006). As part of the fasting response, PGC-1α regulates gluconeogenesis in the liver by 
binding to the nuclear hormone receptors HNF4α and FoxO1 to control expression of key 
enzymes in the gluconeogenic pathway (Puigserver et al., 2003; Rhee et al., 2003). PGC-1α 
is upregulated in several models of diabetes where gluconeogenesis is elevated, highlighting 
its importance in controlling blood glucose levels (Yoon et al., 2001). While PGC-1α whole 
body knockout mice are able to maintain normal blood glucose levels by activating 
PGC-1α-independent pathways (Lin et al., 2004), a partial reduction in PGC-1α levels in 
the liver, using heterozygous knockout mice, leads to modest but significant defects in 
gluconeogenesis (Estall et al., 2009). Moreover, isolated livers from PGC-1α−/− mice 
produce less glucose compared to control mice due to reduced gluconeogenic flux from 
phosphoenolpyruvate (Burgess et al., 2006), indicating that selective gluconeogenic 
inhibition of PGC-1α in the liver can potentially result in reduced HGP and ameliorate 
diabetes.
Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of PGC-1α control its transcriptional activity and 
metabolic function (Fernandez-Marcos and Auwerx, 2011). Specifically, acetylation of 
multiple lysines on PGC-1α determines its ability to co-activate transcription factors 
involved in HGP. As part of the fasting response, SIRT1 deacetylates PGC-1α, resulting in 
enhancement of its activity and increased glucose production (Rodgers et al., 2005). The 
acetyl transferase GCN5, on the other hand, catalyzes acetylation of PGC-1α, reducing 
expression of gluconeogenic genes and glucose output (Dominy et al., 2012; Lerin et al., 
2006). In addition, as part of the response to feeding and insulin, the Cyclin D1/Cdk4 
complex phosphorylates GCN5 to induce its activity and inhibit gluconeogenic gene 
expression (Lee et al., 2014). Another node of the insulin response that regulates the activity 
of PGC-1α during the re-feeding response involves Akt, S6K and Clk2, which 
phosphorylate PGC-1α on its SR domain to inhibit its activity and reduce HGP (Li et al., 
2007; Lustig et al., 2011; Rodgers et al., 2010). Hence, specific manipulation of PGC-1α

 PTMs can be a potential way to control its gluconeogenic activity to improve 
hyperglycemia.
Here, we designed and developed a cell-based high-throughput chemical screen using an 
AlphaLisa assay aimed at identifying chemical scaffolds that induce PGC-1α lysine 
acetylation. Subsequent secondary assays identified a subset of previously uncharacterized 
small molecules that were able to reduce glucose production in primary hepatocytes. As a 
proof of concept of the potential use of these compounds as anti-diabetic drugs, a single hit 
from our screen reduced fasting blood glucose, significantly increased hepatic insulin 
sensitivity and improved glucose homeostasis ameliorating diabetes in dietary and genetic 
mouse models.
Results
An AlphaLisa cell-based high-throughput chemical screening platform identifies small 
molecules that increase PGC-1α acetylation and suppress HGP
To identify novel anti-diabetic chemical probes that increase PGC-1α acetylation and 
subsequently inhibit its gluconeogenic activity, we designed a cell-based high-throughput 
chemical screening platform. We screened the MLP (NIH Molecular Library Probes) and 
DOS (Diversity-Oriented Synthesis) chemical libraries, totaling ~350,000 compounds, using 
the U-2 OS cell line transiently co-expressing PGC-1α and GCN5. We developed an 
AlphaLisa assay (Yasgar et al., 2016) to quantify changes in PGC-1α acetylation upon 
single dose treatment with each compound from these libraries (Fig 1A). Using this 
platform, we could reliably measure changes in PGC-1α acetylation and identified 741 
active compounds which increased the lysine acetylation signal over 50% compared to 
vehicle control (Fig 1B). These compounds were considered positive hits from the primary 
screen. To further winnow our hit list, we re-tested these compounds at dose using the same 
assay. Based on the potency to increase PGC-1α acetylation (AC50 of <10μM) (Fig. 1C, 
Fig. S1A and S1B), 381 compounds were selected. Next, a cytotoxicity assay was applied to 
triage compounds that were toxic to HEK293, HepG2 and A549 cells. As a result, 252 non-
toxic compounds were chosen for secondary screening assays.
PGC-1α activates hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression, and an increase in its acetylation 
status reduces expression of both Pck1 and G6pc genes (Rodgers et al., 2005; Yoon et al., 
2001). We predicted that a set of the selected 252 positive small molecule hits would 
suppress gluconeogenic gene expression in primary hepatocytes. Thus, we performed a 
high-throughput screen with these 252 compounds at different doses. Hepatocytes were 
treated with forskolin for 1.5 hours to induce the expression of both Pck1 and G6pc genes, 
which mimics the fasting and PGC-1α-mediated gluconeogenic response. The dose response 
curves were used to calculate an inhibitory activity of the compounds by determining the 
difference in Ct values between compound treatment and forskolin control at each dose, and 
provided an estimated potency of the compounds in suppressing Pck1 and G6pc (Fig. 1D, 
Fig. S1C). As a result, 42 compounds were selected with an estimated inhibitory AC50 of 
<10μM for either Pck1 or G6pc. These compounds are inhibitors of forskolin-induced 
gluconeogenic gene expression and predicted to reduce glucose production. To specifically 
test the inhibitory activity of the remaining small molecule positive hits on PGC-1α-

 mediated glucose production, we used adenoviruses to ectopically express PGC-1α in 
primary hepatocytes. Similar to forskolin, PGC-1α overexpression induces gluconeogenic 
gene expression and promotes glucose release (Herzig et al., 2001; Yoon et al., 2001). 
Primary hepatocytes were treated with the chosen positive hit compounds that could 
suppress gluconeogenic gene expression, and the concentration of glucose released to the 
culture medium was measured. In this small assay screen, 9 compounds significantly 
suppressed glucose release compared to control (Fig. 1E and Fig. S1D). Interestingly, 
metformin is only able to suppress glucose production at a higher concentration (100–
250μM) (He and Wondisford, 2015), compared to our identified compound collection 
(20μM), highlighting the potency of these chemical scaffolds to inhibit glucose output. 
Taken together, using a high-throughput chemical screen platform, we have identified 
chemical scaffolds that induce acetylation of PGC-1α, suppress expression of gluconeogenic 
genes and reduce glucose production. Due to their ability to inhibit glucose release from 
hepatocytes, these compounds can potentially be used as anti-diabetic drugs to reduce blood 
glucose through suppression of HGP. These scaffolds provide chemical tools that can be 
used, not only to develop new anti-diabetic drugs, but also to identify molecular and 
metabolic pathways that regulate HGP.
SR-18292 suppresses hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression and glucose production in 
primary hepatocytes
To test anti-diabetic effects of the positive hits that scored in all the assays described above, 
we selected the most potent compounds that decreased glucose production. Compound 82 
(C-82) was the top small molecule hit suppressing glucose production (Fig. 1E). However, 
C-82 showed poor bioavailability and solubility (data not shown) and would require 
extensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies to test this compound in vivo. We 
therefore selected the second most potent small molecule, compound 80 (C-80), for further 
validation and characterization. C-80 is part of the NIH Molecular Libraries Compound 
Collection and has been screened against 545 bioassays that represent diverse targets and a 
range of readouts. C-80 was found active in only 14 bioassays (2.5%), two of these 
bioassays are part of our high-throughput screens, highlighting the lack of promiscuity of 
C-80. Moreover, C-80 showed the highest potency in our confirmatory screen (https://
pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assay/bioactivity.html?cid=24747703).
Due to limited commercial availability, we synthesized an analog of C-80 that we named 
SR-18292. This analog is identical to C-80, except the methyl group on the 3′ position on 
the indole group that is lacking in SR-18292 (Fig. 2A). To confirm that the effects of 
SR-18292 were similar to C-80, primary hepatocytes were treated with SR-18292, which 
increased PGC-1α acetylation (Fig. 2B). The acetylation status of PGC-1α is determined by 
its dynamic interaction with deacetylases and acetyl transferases, primarily SIRT1 and 
GCN5 (Lerin et al., 2006; Rodgers et al., 2005). Interestingly, SR-18292 increased 
acetylation of PGC-1α even in the presence of Ex-527, a selective SIRT1 inhibitor, and 
Trichostatin A (TSA), a pan-histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. This result suggests that 
the increased acetylation of PGC-1α, induced by SR-18292, is mediated by a mechanism 
that does not involve inhibition of either SIRT1 or other HDACs.

 Upon fasting, increased plasma glucagon levels induce gluconeogenic genes in the liver, and 
PGC-1α is a component of this response (Altarejos and Montminy, 2011; Herzig et al., 
2001; Rodgers et al., 2008). In agreement with SR-18292 inhibiting PGC-1α gluconeogenic 
function, treatment of hepatocytes with SR-18292 significantly reduced the ability of 
glucagon to stimulate Pck1 and G6pc gene expression (Fig. 2C). This was achieved without 
disrupting the canonical glucagon-induced increases in phosphorylation of CREB and 
dephosphorylation of CRTC2 (Fig. S2A). In addition, cell autonomous enhancement of 
insulin signaling was not observed (Fig. S2B), suggesting that the effect of SR-18292 on 
gene expression at the cellular level is probably downstream of the signaling cascade that 
results in activation of CREB and Akt. Importantly, SR-18292 did not cause hepatocyte 
toxicity as measured by cell viability or total protein levels (Fig. S2C–E).
As a major regulator of Pck1 and G6pc transcription, overexpression of PGC-1α in 
hepatocytes is sufficient to induce expression of these genes (Herzig et al., 2001; Yoon et al., 
2001). Similar to its effects with glucagon, SR-18292 significantly reduced gluconeogenic 
gene and protein expression induced by ectopic expression of PGC-1α (Fig. 2D Fig. S2F). 
Since increased gluconeogenic gene expression is driven solely by PGC-1α in these 
experiments, the suppression of these genes suggests a direct effect of SR-18292 on the 
PGC-1α transcriptional complex that inhibits expression of Pck1 and G6pc genes. Reducing 
the expression of PGC-1α by siRNA significantly impairs the ability of SR-18292 to 
suppress Pck1 and G6pc, suggesting that its effect is at least partially mediated by PGC-1α 
(Fig. 2E). Consistent with the effects on suppression of gluconeogenic genes, SR-18292 
significantly reduced glucagon- and PGC-1α-mediated glucose production in isolated 
hepatocytes (Fig. 2F and G). Interestingly, SR-18292 decreases glucose production when 
pyruvate and lactate are used as substrates for gluconeogenesis as well as when glycerol is 
used as a substrate (Fig. 2F and G). The reduction in glucose production correlated with 
suppression of Pck1 and G6pc since short treatment with SR-18292 (3 hr) had no effect on 
gene expression or glucose release (Fig. S2G and H). Together, these results show that 
SR-18292 is a potent inhibitor of the gluconeogenic gene expression and glucose production 
in hepatocytes.
SR-18292 increases the interaction of PGC-1α with GCN5 and reduces co-activation of 
HNF4α by PGC-1α
The PGC-1α acetylation data from primary hepatocytes (Fig. 2B) implies that SR-18292 
induces acetylation by a mechanism that does not involve inhibition of HDACs. We 
therefore tested the possibility that the SR-18292-mediated increase in PGC-1α acetylation 
is modulated by GCN5, an acetyl transferase known to acetylate PGC-1α (Lerin et al., 
2006). First, we tested if the catalytic activity of GCN5 is increased as a result of SR-18292 
treatment. To this end, GCN5 was overexpressed and subsequently immunoprecipitated (IP) 
from U-2 OS cells treated with SR-18292. We found that the catalytic activity was not 
changed compared to GCN5 IPed from control cells (Fig. S3A). In addition, SR-18292 does 
not directly activate GCN5 since in vitro treatment of IPed GCN5 did not result in increased 
activity (Fig. S3B). We then speculated that while the catalytic activity of GCN5 is not 
changed by SR-18292, its physical interaction with PGC-1α might be modulated by this 
treatment. Ectopic expression and co-IP of PGC-1α from U-2 OS cells revealed that the

 interaction of endogenous GCN5, as well as ectopically expressed GCN5, with PGC-1α was 
increased in cells that were treated with SR-18292 (Fig. 3A and S3C). To identify the 
PGC-1α lysine residues that are affected by treatment with SR-18292, we performed mass 
spectrometry analysis and identified 7 lysine residues whose acetylation was increased (Fig. 
S3D). Two of these sites (K277 and K346) were previously described, and the increased 
acetylation of these sites is associated with reduced gluconeogenic activity of PGC-1α 
(Rodgers et al., 2005). Together, these results suggest that by increasing the interaction of 
GCN5 with PGC-1α, SR-18292 increases the acetylation of specific PGC-1α lysine 
residues that might subsequently decrease its gluconeogenic activity.
We previously shown that by interacting with PGC-1α, the GCN5 acetyl transferase 
complex decreases PGC-1α gluconeogenic transcriptional activation (Lerin et al., 2006). 
This is achieved at least in part by reducing the ability of PGC-1α to co-activate the nuclear 
hormone receptor HNF4α. Co-activation of HNF4α by PGC-1α is required to promote 
transcription of the gluconeogenic genes Pck1 and G6pc (Rhee et al., 2003). To test whether 
SR-18292 reduces the transcriptional activity of HNF4α that is induced by PGC-1α, we 
used a luciferase reporter construct driven by a fragment of the Pck1 promoter containing an 
HNF4α binding site (Sugiyama et al., 2000). In agreement with the enhanced interaction 
between PGC-1α and GCN5, the transcriptional activity of HNF4α was significantly 
reduced in cells treated with SR-18292 (Fig. 3B). To further characterize the SR-18292-
mediated inhibition of HNF4α transcriptional activity, we performed chromatin 
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to examine the promoter occupancy of HNF4α on Pck1 
and G6pc promoters. Primary hepatocytes were treated with glucagon to induce 
gluconeogenic gene transcripts, and antibodies against HNF4α were used to IP chromatin 
fragments bound to this protein. In accordance with the inhibitory effect of SR-18292 on 
Pck1 and G6pc expression, the glucagon-induced Pck1 and G6pc promoter occupancy by 
HNF4α was significantly reduced in cells treated with SR-18292 (Fig. 3C). The FoxO1 
promoter occupancy was not altered (Fig. S3E), suggesting that this effect is specific to 
HNF4α. Epigenetic changes accompany the response to glucagon in the fasted state, 
including an increase in activating H3K9 acetylation (H3K9Ac) and H3K4 trimethylation 
(H3K4Me3) of the Pck1 and G6pc genes (Ravnskjaer et al., 2013). Interestingly, compound-
treated hepatocytes had reduced H3K9Ac and H3K4Me3 marks on the Pck1 gene (Fig. 3D 
and E ), further supporting our findings that upon treatment, transcription of this gene is less 
active. These results suggest that by modulating the interaction between GCN5 and 
PGC-1α, SR-18292 inhibits the gluconeogenic activity of PGC-1α and reduces co-
activation of HNF4α. In addition, SR-18292 treatment decreases occupancy of HNF4α on 
Pck1 and G6pc promoters, leading to reduced expression of gluconeogenic genes.
Identification of SR-18292 small molecule analogs lacking gluconeogenic inhibitory effects
To gain further insights into the mode of action of SR-18292, we performed SAR studies to 
search for chemical modifications that impair its activity, as this might reveal the active site 
of the compound. We generated a panel of chemical analogs and tested their ability to 
suppress gluconeogenic gene expression induced by either glucagon or PGC-1α 
overexpression. Interestingly, we found that replacement of the indole group with phenyl 
(Fig. S4A, SR-19138) reduced the inhibitory effect of the new scaffold on glucagon or

 PGC-1α-increased Pck1 and G6pc expression (Fig. S4B and C). Other analogs of the 
compound had little or no effect on gluconeogenic activity (Fig. S4B and C). This suggests 
that hydrogen bond interaction in this part of the molecule might be important for activity. 
The reduced effect of the new analog on suppression of Pck1 and G6pc correlated with a 
reduced ability to induce acetylation of PGC-1α compared to the parent compound, 
SR-18292 (Fig. S4D). These results indicate that the indole group is involved in the 
bioactivity of SR-18292.
SR-18292 reduces fasting blood glucose, increases hepatic insulin sensitivity and 
improves glucose homeostasis in diabetic mice
Based on the potent gluconeogenic suppressor effects of SR-18292 in primary hepatocytes, 
we tested its potential use as an anti-diabetic drug. In the fasted state, the liver contributes to 
regulating blood glucose levels through the release of glucose into the circulation 
(Cherrington, 1999; Moore et al., 2012). Therefore, we focused on measuring blood glucose 
in the fasted state during which the liver plays a major role maintaining glycemia. 
Preliminary pharmacokinetics (PK) studies with the original C-80 revealed that the 
compound concentration in the liver, 2 h following a single dose (30 mg/kg) administration 
via intraperitoneal (I.P.) injection, was 2.3μM. We projected that multiple injections of a 
higher dose might be sufficient to reach active concentration in the liver. We used high fat 
diet (HFD) fed mice, a dietary model of obesity and T2D, which were treated with 
SR-18292 (45mg/kg) via I.P. injection for 3 consecutive days and again on day 4 before 
measuring fasting blood glucose. Strikingly, mice that were treated with SR-18292 had 
significantly lower levels of fasting blood glucose concentrations compared to matched 
vehicle-treated control mice (Fig. 4A). The induction of gluconeogenic gene expression is a 
regulatory component of the response to fasting. Importantly, gluconeogenic gene 
expression, specifically that of Pck1, is inhibited in livers isolated from mice treated with 
SR-18292 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that SR-18292 targets similar hepatic glucose metabolic 
pathways both in vitro and in vivo.
The reduction in fasting blood glucose concentration is not likely to be a result of reduced 
calorie consumption as neither food intake nor body weight were changed as a result of 
treatment with SR-18292 (Fig. 4C and D). In addition, liver toxicity, as measured by serum 
levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) and bilirubin, was not observed in mice treated with SR-18292 (Table 
S1). Basal blood insulin levels, while trending lower, were not significantly changed as a 
consequence of SR-18292 treatment as indicated by similar fasting blood insulin levels in 
both the SR-18292-treated and the vehicle control groups (Fig. 4E). In addition, 
phosphorylation of Akt was also not changed (Fig. 4F), suggesting that SR-18292 does not 
exert its blood glucose-lowering effects by affecting insulin secretion or canonical insulin 
signaling. To assess the contribution of PGC-1α in mediating the in vivo effects of 
SR-18292, we depleted hepatic PGC-1α in Lep°b/°b mice using shRNA and observed a 
significant reduction in basal blood glucose concentrations compared to control. Importantly, 
reduced levels of PGC-1α in the liver blunted SR-18292-mediated reductions in blood 
glucose concentrations, indicating that PGC-1α contributes to the SR-18292 metabolic 
action (Fig. 4G). To fully assess the effects of SR-18292 on whole body glucose homeostasis

 and insulin resistance, we performed a glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance 
test (ITT) following the same protocol used to determine fasting blood glucose. 
Interestingly, SR-18292 treatment significantly enhanced glucose tolerance both in DIO 
mice and Lep°b/°b mice (Fig. 4H and I). As expected, insulin levels after GTT were lower in 
the treated group (Fig. S5A). In addition, the response to insulin was also enhanced in the 
drug treated group (Fig. 4J), suggesting an improved response to insulin at the whole body 
level. To test if SR-18292 chronic treatment will cause similar anti-diabetic effects, we 
treated mice for a period of 14 days. The ability of SR-18292 to reduce blood glucose was 
sustained during this period without resulting in changes in body weight (Fig S5G and H). 
Importantly, this longer treatment did not cause any signs of toxicity as measured by serum 
ALT and AST levels, H&E staining of liver slices and the expression of proinflammatory 
genes (Fig. S5I–K).
SR-18292 suppresses HGP and increases liver insulin sensitivity in vivo
The strong effects of SR-18292 in primary hepatocytes prompted us to specifically test the 
ability of the liver to produce glucose upon treatment with SR-18292. To this end, we 
performed a pyruvate tolerance test (PTT), in which pyruvate is injected to mice to increase 
HGP. In accordance with the effects in isolated hepatocytes, glucose levels after pyruvate 
injection were significantly reduced in the SR-18292 treated group, suggesting that HGP 
from pyruvate is impaired as a result of the compound treatment (Fig. 5A and S5B). 
Interestingly, the defects in glucose production were comparable to that mediated by 
metformin treatment. To further analyze the cause of changes in blood glucose we carried 
out hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies in HFD-fed mice treated with SR-18292. 
The glucose infusion rate in the SR-18292-treated mice was substantially higher compared 
to vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 5B), reflecting the improved insulin sensitivity. Importantly, 
this was not due to improved peripheral glucose uptake (Fig. 5C) but rather by reduced 
endogenous glucose production both under basal and clamp conditions (Fig. 5D), further 
corroborating that SR-18292 improves hyperglycemia via reduction in HGP and strongly 
increases selective hepatic insulin sensitivity. Inhibition of HGP can result in a side effect in 
which carbons are diverted toward lipid synthesis, leading ultimately to accumulation of 
triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver causing hepatic steatosis. The treatment with 
SR-18292 did not cause this side effect, as liver TG and cholesterol levels were not changed 
even after prolonged treatment (Fig. 5E and S5L). Another concern associated with 
inhibition of gluconeogenesis is accumulation of lactate or ketone bodies in the blood that 
can lead to lactic- or keto-acidosis, respectively, a major concern in diabetes management. 
Treatment with SR-18292 is not likely to induce such an effect since both serum lactate and 
ketone bodies were not changed (Fig. S5C and M). The transcriptional lipid metabolic 
profile (Fig. S5D), serum levels of TG, free fatty acids and cholesterol (Fig. S5E) were not 
significantly altered with SR-18292 treatment. In addition, the expression level of 
mitochondrial genes, also targeted by PGC-1α, was not changed, further showing the 
selectivity of SR-18292 toward inhibition of gluconeogenesis (Fig. S5F). Collectively, these 
data define SR-18292 as a chemical scaffold that significantly improves overall glucose 
homeostasis and support the potential use of this compound as a drug treatment to control 
blood glucose levels in diabetic states. It also shows that selective chemical inhibition of

 PGC-1α gluconeogenic activity in hepatocytes is a feasible strategy to reduce fasting blood 
glucose and improve hyperglycemia in pre-clinical mouse models of T2D.
Discussion
The dramatic increase in the prevalence of T2D as part of the metabolic syndrome is 
believed to be primarily a result of modern life style, which creates an imbalance between 
energy expenditure and energy consumption. There are currently several drug classes that 
are mainly being used in the clinic to treat T2D. The first class is the biguanides, which 
includes metformin, and is the most widely used class and considered the first choice as a 
mean to reduce HbA1c index. Other classes include primarily the sulfonylureas, GLP-1 
receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors, which ultimately stimulate insulin secretion, and the 
TZDs, which increase insulin sensitivity by activation of the nuclear receptor PPARγ. When 
desired HbA1c index is not achieved using metformin as a monotherapy, a two-drug 
combination, that includes metformin and an additional drug, is the recommended strategy 
(Bailey, 2013). Administration of insulin is also considered as an approach to reduce HbA1c 
levels, but the risk of developing hypoglycemia is higher compared to other treatments. 
Despite the low cost and high efficiency of metformin treatment, the common need for a 
two-drug combination approach highlights the importance of developing new drug classes 
that could be used in the clinic either as a monotherapy or as part of a combination 
approach. HGP can be suppressed by targeting PGC-1α leading to reduced hyperglycemia 
(Herzig et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2014; Lerin et al., 2006; Yoon et al., 2001). These studies 
suggest that drugs that selectively inhibit hepatic PGC-1α gluconeogenic function might 
constitute a new class of anti-diabetic drugs. Here, we describe the identification of such a 
class of compounds that reduce glucose release from isolated hepatocytes and select one of 
these small molecules hits to show that it ameliorates diabetes.
Based on the fact that increased PGC-1α acetylation reduces gluconeogenic activity 
(Rodgers et al., 2005), we designed and developed a cell-based high-throughput chemical 
screening platform using PGC-1α acetylation as a read out. Hepatic PGC-1α depletion 
blunted the effects of SR-18292 reducing blood glucose levels and while our results 
correlate PGC-1α acetylation with suppression of hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression, 
we cannot conclude at this point that the increased acetylation of PGC-1α is necessary 
and/or sufficient to mediate the effect of these compounds. It is unclear at this point how 
these compounds mediate increases of PGC-1α acetylation and which sites are specifically 
linked to suppression of hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression. A possible mechanism 
suggested by our data with SR-18292 points towards the dissociation of the HNF4α and 
GCN5-PGC1α complex from the chromatin of these promoters. Displacement of this 
complex will be consistent with the decreases in H3K9 acetylation/H3K4 trimethylation 
activation marks observed at the Pck1 promoter and decreases in gene expression after 
SR-18292 treatment. Regardless of whether the effects of the compounds we have found are 
mediated solely by mechanisms linked to PGC-1α acetylation or not, it will be of interest to 
use these compounds as a discovery tool to study how glucose production is regulated in 
hepatocytes. Since the direct molecular targets of these compounds are currently unknown, 
further investigation into their targets might shed new light on the components that are

 important for the regulation of glucose output and hepatic insulin action. These molecular 
targets can also constitute potential new therapeutic strategies to treat T2D.
Several studies have demonstrated the importance of GCN5 and its close homolog PCAF in 
regulating the gluconeogenic activity of PGC-1α by catalyzing its acetylation (Dominy et 
al., 2011; Sun et al., 2014). This study highlights the potential targeting of the GCN5/
PGC-1α axis by small molecules for diabetes treatment, and is in agreement with our 
previous studies that found that inhibition of the Cdk4 kinase complex reduces GCN5 
activity and can result in less acetylated PGC-1α and elevated blood glucose levels (Lee et 
al., 2014). The increased binding between PGC-1α and GCN5, mediated by SR-18292, 
leads to reduced HNF4α transcriptional activity and to its removal from Pck1 and G6pc 
promoter regions. GCN5 is normally associated with increased histone acetylation and more 
active chromatin (Bodo et al., 1977), suggesting its effect on Pck1 and G6pc expression 
through PGC-1α acetylation overcomes its effect on histone modification. A negative effect 
of GCN5 on transcription was also documented by its acetylation-mediated regulation of the 
SWI/SNF complex, which leads to dissociation of SWI/SNF from chromatin (Kim et al., 
2010). SR-18292 promotes the displacement of HNF4α from the promoter regions, and 
probably of the protein complex, supporting a model in which GCN5 acetylates PGC-1α, 
which in turn results in a remodeled transcription complex that dissociates from the Pck1 
and G6pc promoters. The reduction in H3K9Ac levels may be a result of the removal of 
GCN5 from the Pck1 promoter. The magnitude of HNF4α removal from the Pck1 promoter 
exceeds the reduction of H3K9Ac and H3K4Me3 marks and probably forms part of a 
sequence of chromatin events at gluconeogenic promoters caused by SR-18292.
At the cellular level, it is not clear at this point what protein(s) or enzyme(s) are directly 
targeted by SR-18292. It is possible that the target of SR-18292 modifies GCN5, increasing 
its binding to PGC-1α., Along these lines, we have previously shown that the Cyclin D1/
Cdk4 complex can activate GCN5 in response to insulin and amino acids through 
phosphorylation of T272 and S372 (Lee et al., 2014), and that SIRT6 increases GCN5 
activity through deacetylation of K549 (Dominy et al., 2012), demonstrating the existence of 
such effectors that regulate GCN5 activity by PTMs. Although these sites were not 
modulated by SR-18292 (data not shown), suggesting that Cyclin D1/Cdk4 and SIRT6 do 
not mediate the effect of SR-18292, modification of other sites might be responsible to 
promote the interaction between GCN5 and PGC-1α. Alternatively, since GCN5 and 
PGC-1α are part of larger complexes that regulate transcription, SR-18292 could directly 
target upstream regulators or a component of these complexes that enhance the interaction 
between PGC-1α and GCN5. The identification of this target would further define the anti-
diabetic effects of this compound and expand the therapeutic possibilities.
It is generally agreed upon that the elevated HGP in T2D is a result of increased 
gluconeogenesis (Hundal et al., 2000; Magnusson et al., 1992). This probably reflects the 
chronic insulin resistance in T2D that impairs the ability of insulin to suppress 
gluconeogenesis. Hence, targeting components within the gluconeogenic pathway, like 
PEPCK and G6Pase, can potentially improve hyperglycemia. However, gluconeogenic 
fluxes can be controlled independently of changes in gluconeogenic enzymes levels, such as 
PEPCK (Burgess et al., 2007; Madiraju et al., 2014; Perry et al., 2015; Perry et al., 2014; 
Sharabi et al.

 Ramnanan et al., 2010; Samuel et al., 2009) raising the question whether inhibiting 
gluconeogenesis via manipulation of these enzymes can indeed reduce HGP in diabetic 
states. While it is clear that acute insulin-mediated suppression of HGP (Ramnanan et al., 
2010) and gluconeogenesis (Perry et al., 2015) can occur independent of changes in 
gluconeogenic gene expression, the tight regulation of gluconeogenic genes by the feeding 
status is an important feature of insulin action on HGP (Pilkis and Granner, 1992). Thus, it is 
possible that in diabetic conditions, where gluconeogenesis is chronically elevated, 
modulation of expression and activity of gluconeogenic enzymes affect the flux of this 
pathway and control HGP and insulin sensitivity. In fact, early studies show that inhibition 
of gluconeogenesis by 3-mercaptopicolinic acid, a preferential PEPCK inhibitor, results in 
hypoglycemia, supporting PEPCK’s importance in glucose homeostasis (DiTullio et al., 
1974). Our findings support that non-genetic inhibition of gluconeogenic gene expression 
reduces HGP and improves hyperglycemia. The mechanism of action of SR-18292 is to 
decrease expression of gluconeogenic genes, mainly PEPCK in vivo, however, it is 
conceivable that additional mechanisms contribute to the potent effects of this compound on 
HGP and insulin sensitivity. While we cannot exclude at this point that SR-18292 mediates 
its effect by targeting other tissues other than the liver, based on the potent and selective 
effects on glucose production and hepatic insulin sensitivity, our results suggest that the liver 
is a major target of SR-18292 and probably accounts for a significant part of its anti-diabetic 
effects.
In summary, the findings presented in this study have implications for the regulatory 
mechanisms underlying diabetes. We have identified small molecules that can be used as 
chemical tools to study the regulation of glucose metabolism. These chemical compounds 
target components within the hepatic PGC-1α gluconeogenic pathway and reduce glucose 
production. In particular, we have found a chemical scaffold that improves glucose 
homeostasis in a preclinical mouse model. These small molecules have the potential to be 
used either as a single agent or in combination with current anti-diabetic drugs.

Experimental Model and Subject Details
Animal procedures—All mice were purchased from Jackson laboratories and housed 
under a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle at 22 °C. Before handling, mice were allowed to acclimate 
for at least 1 week in our animal facility. For in vivo studies with DIO mice, males 6–8 
weeks old were fed HFD for the indicated time. For drug administration, SR-18292 was re-
suspended in a 10% DMSO/10% Tween80/80% PBS solution at a final concentration of 6–
12 mg/ml. Metformin was re-suspended in the same solution at a 20mg/ml concentration. 
SR-18292 was injected via I.P. for 3 days between 4–5pm and food was removed on day 3 at 
5pm. The following morning (day 4) SR-18292 was injected again (for a total of 4 
injections) and blood glucose was measured after 3 hours. Injection volume did not exceed

 275μl per mouse. Metformin was administered via oral gavage. Pyruvate tolerance and 
glucose tolerance tests were performed following the same dosing protocol, but 3 hours after 
the last injection mice were injected with either pyruvate (2g/Kg) or glucose (2g/kg or 
0.5g/kg for Lep°b/°b) and blood glucose was measured every 20 minutes. Insulin tolerance 
test was performed following the same dosing protocol, but mice were fasted for 4 hours 
after the forth injection before performing the test. Insulin was injected via I.P. (0.5U/Kg) 
and blood glucose was measured every 20 minutes. Glycemia was measured by tail bleed 
using a glucometer (OneTouch). For all experiments, age- and body weight- matched 
animals were used. For protein, RNA extracts and biochemistry studies, livers were removed 
following each experiment and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. For information on number of 
animals in each experiment please refer to figures 4, 5 and S5 legends. All studies were 
performed according to protocols approved by Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center’s 
Animal Care and Use Committee.
Primary hepatocytes and cell cultures—U-2 OS cell lines were maintained in DMEM 
containing 10% FBS. Transfections were performed with Polyfect (QIAGEN) with a fixed 
total quantity of DNA. Cells were collected after 24 h or 48 h of transfection as indicated. 
Medium was changed every day as well as 3 h before collecting cells.
Primary hepatocytes were isolated from 8- to 12-week-old male C57BL/6 mice by perfusion 
with liver digest medium (Invitrogen, 17703-034) followed by 70μm mesh filtration. Percoll 
(Sigma, P7828) gradient centrifugation allowed primary hepatocytes isolation from other 
cell types and debris. Cells were seeded in plating medium (DMEM with 10% FBS, 2mM 
sodium pyruvate, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1 M dexamethasone, and 100nM insulin). 
After 4 h of seeding, the medium was changed and incubated overnight in maintenance 
medium (DMEM, 0.2% BSA, 2mM sodium pyruvate, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1 M 
dexamethasone, and 1nM insulin). To infect cells, the indicated adenoviruses were added at 
MOI of 2.5 to 5 for 4 h. Cells were collected within 48 h after infection and medium was 
changed every day.
Method details
Primary and secondary AlphaLisa screen to determine single dose and dose 
response effects on PGC-1α acetylation—U-2 OS cells were thawed and grown in 4 
Triple flasks (NUNC) with growth medium. After 48 hours, cells were harvested and seeded 
in 4 Hyper flasks at a density of 15–20 million cell each. Cells were then grown for 4–5 days 
until reached confluency. After reaching the desired confluency, medium was changed to 
assay medium and cells were infected with Ad-PGC-1α and Ad-GCN5 for 4 hours. 
Following infection, medium was changed to phenol-free medium and cells were incubated 
overnight. The following day, cells were harvested and seeded on a 384-well plate at 7000 
cells/well in 50μl assay media. Cells were allowed to adhere for 4–8 hours after which 100nl 
of compound was added. After overnight incubation with compound, media was aspirated 
and cells were incubated with lysis buffer for 1 hour at RT. For detection of acetylated 
PGC-1α, cells were incubated with 6μl of Acetyl-Lys antibody for 1 hour at RT. Lysates 
were then incubated with Alpha acceptor beads (6μl, 1 hour RT) and Alpha donor beads 
(6μl, 1 hour RT). Perkin Elmer EnVision plate reader was used for signal detection using

 Alpha protocol. For each compound, activity score was calculated based on the mean of the 
normalized and corrected sample activity replicates. Compounds with activity score ≥50 
(50% activity above neutral control) were called as hits. As a positive control, each plate 
contained wells that were treated with fascaplysin, a CDK4 inhibitor, that reduces the 
acetylation of PGC-1α. For a compound to be called a hit all replicates had to be considered 
hits (also, please refer to: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/651723). Active hits 
from primary screen were then used in a secondary screen to determine AC50 toward 
PGC-1α acetylation. Same protocol for detection of PGC-1α acetylation was applied but 
compounds were added at different doses. For each sample the highest valid tested 
concentration was determined and set as Maximum concentration. Raw signals of the plate 
wells were normalized using the ‘Neutral Controls Minus Inhibitors’ method in Genedata 
Assay Analyzer (v10.0.2). AC values were calculated using the curve fitting strategies in 
Genedata Screener Condoseo (7.0.3) and up to the active concentration limit (Maximum 
concentration) described for each sample (also, please refer to: https://
pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/720513).
Highthroughput cytotoxicity panel—To determine potential cytotoxicity of identified 
compounds 3 different cell lines were used (HEK293, HepG2 and A549). Cells were grown 
in Triple flask to reach ~95% confluence and then re-suspended for dispensing at 50,000 
cells/mL of medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, Penicillin//Strep/L-Glutamine). The following day, 
cells were plated on 384-well plates in 40μl medium and incubated for 24 hours in standard 
tissue culture conditions. Compounds (100nl) were then added at different doses into 40μl 
assay volume and incubated for 72 hours. To determine cell viability, plates were removed 
from the incubator and allowed to cool down for 15 minutes and viability was determined by 
addition of 20μl 50% Promega CellTiterGlo (diluted 1:1 with PBS, pH 7.4) and incubation 
at RT for 5 minutes. PerkinElmer EnVision was used to measure luminescence.
High throughput qPCR screen—To determine the effects of compounds on expression 
level of Pck1 and G6pc genes, primary hepatocytes were isolated as described in the 
Experimental Model and Subject Details section. Following isolation, hepatocytes were 
seeded in 384-well plates at 4000 cells/well in 40μl plating medium and incubated overnight 
at 37°C. The next morning, plating media was aspirated and 40μl maintenance medium 
(DMEM, 5% FBS, 2mM sodium pyruvate, 1% Pen/Strep, 1nM insulin, 0.1μM 
dexamethasone) was added. Incubation at 37°C was continued until afternoon when 
compounds w ere added (100nl) at dose using 384 well pin tool on pin table (Walkup Cybi 
Well). After overnight incubation, maintenance medium was aspirated and low serum 
medium was added (DMEM, 5% FBS, 2mM sodium pyruvate, 1% Pen/Strep). Compounds 
were re pinned to cells and plates were returned to incubator for additional 3 hours. After 3 
hours forskolin stimulation started for additional 1.5 hours. For cDNA synthesis Cells-to-Ct 
kit (Ambion, 4391851C) was used. The medium was aspirated and cells were washed twice 
(100μL with PBS) using the ELX405 Plate washer (Biotek). The assay plates were flipped 
upside down and centrifuged at 1000 rpm 2 minutes to remove the excess liquid. 10μL of 
Lysis solution with DNase I (from Cell to CT Lysis kit, Ambion) was added to each well 
using the MultiDrop Combi/Standard tube dispensing cassette (Thermo Scientific). Each 
assay plate was then shaken for 2 minutes and incubated for an additional 8 minutes at RT.

 At the end of the incubation, 1μL of stop solution was added with the Multidrop Combi-nl 
(Thermo Scientific) and the assay plates were centrifuged (face up) (1000 rpm, 2minutes). 
The assay plates were incubated for 2 minutes at RT and processed for reverse transcription. 
For reverse transcription, 8μL of RT master mix (RT buffer, RT Enzyme mix, H2O) was 
dispensed into each well of a RT assay plate (Axygen, PCR-384 RGD C). 2μL of the lysed 
cells were transferred into RT assay plate using Vario transfer unit (CyBi Well). The RT 
assay plates were incubated at 37°C for 1h and the reverse transcript ase is inactivated by 
incubating the plates for 1 minute at 95°C. qPCR assay was performed by the a ddition of 
4μl/well of PCR master mix (Roche) to PCR plate (Roche Light Cycler 480 MultiWell Plate 
384, Cat# 04 729 749 001) using the Multidrop Combi-nl (Thermo Scientific). 1μL/well of 
RT DNA is then transferred to the 4μL/well PCR plate using CyBi Well. The PCR plates 
were centrifuged (face up) for 2 minutes at 1000 rpm. PCR was performed using 
ThermoCycler (Roche Light Cycler 480 II) with Macro Probe Protocol (95°C for 10min, 55 
cycles of 95°C f or 10 sec, 60°C for 30 sec and 40°C for 30 sec). TaqMan probe sets that 
were used (Mouse Pck1, Applied Biosystems, 4351370 (Mm01247058_m1), Mouse G6pc, 
Applied Biosystems, 4351370 (Mm00839363_m1), mouse Gapdh, Applied Biosystems 
(4352339E)). To calculate inhibitory AC50, dose response curves were generated by 
determining the difference in Ct values between compound treatment and forskolin control 
at each dose and were fit to the Hill equation. Curves were forced through 100% inhibitory 
activity (which was determined to be the DMSO control), so as to generate AC50 values 
calculated based on these curve, that were comparable between compounds. This was done 
even if in some cases higher inhibition than the DMSO control was observed. AC values 
were calculated using the curve fitting strategies in Genedata Screener Condoseo (7.0.3).

Drug treatment of primary hepatocytes for measurement of protein 
modification, gene expression and glucose output—For measurement of 
acetylation, gene expression and glucose production SR-18292 (20μM) was added to cells 
overnight and fresh compound was added the following day for additional 3 h before 
collecting the cells (for total of ~18 h treatment). Where insulin and glucagon stimulation 
were performed, the medium was changed to starvation medium (DMEM, 0.2% BSA, 2mM 
sodium pyruvate, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) with fresh compound for the last 3 h and 
cells were stimulated with either 100nM insulin or 200nM glucagon for an extra 1.5 h. For 
glucose measurements following PGC-1α over expression cells were incubated for the last 3 
h in glucose-free medium (phenol-red/glucose free DMEM, 0.2% BSA, 2mM sodium 
pyruvate and 20mM sodium lactate or 10mM glycerol in case glycerol was used as 
substrate). For glucose measurements following glucagon stimulation cells were incubated 
for the last 4 h in the same glucose-free medium that also contained glucagon (200nM). The 
glucose level in the medium was measured using a glucose assay kit from Eton Biosience 
Inc. by adding 50μl of assay buffer to 50μl of medium followed by 15 min incubation at 
37°C. Absorbance was measured at 490nm.

 DNA constructs and adenoviruses—Adenoviruses were produced with the pAd-
Track/pAd-Easy system. FLAG-HA-PGC-1α and FLAG-GCN5 adenoviruses were made as 
previously described (Lerin et al., 2006; Rodgers et al., 2005). FLAG-HA-PGC-1α, FLAG-
GCN5 pcDNA 3.1 constructs were made as previously described (Lerin et al., 2006; 
Rodgers et al., 2005). shLacZ was cloned into the BLOCK-iT™ U6 RNAi Entry Vector Kit 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and subsequently cloned into the pAd/BLOCK-iT™ RNAi 
vector. shPGC-1α was produced using the pAd-Track/pAd-Easy system and was a kind gift 
from the Montminy lab (Koo et al., 2004).
siRNA mediated knock down of Ppargc1a—siRNA oligos against mouse Ppargc1a 
were purchased from OriGene (SR420231). Hepatocytes were transfected with a 1:1:1: 
mixture of 3 unique 27mer siRNA duplexes (20μM each) using Lipofectamin RNAiMax 
(Invitrogen) immediately upon seeding with plating medium. The following morning cells 
were washed with PBS and medium was changed to maintenance medium. In the afternoon, 
cells were transfected again and compound treatment started.
Cell lysis and immunoprecipitation—For PGC-1α acetylation detection in hepatocytes 
cells were infected with Ad-PGC-1α and Ad-GCN5. Cells were collected in RIPA buffer 
(containing protease inhibitor cocktail, 5mM NaF, 5mM β-glycerophosphate, 10mM 
nicotinamide, 1mM DTT and 1 M trichostatin A). FLAG–HA-PGC-1α was 
immunoprecipitated overnight at 4°C with FLAG beads (Sigma A2220). For GCN5 
interaction with PGC-1α, U-2 OS cells were infected with Ad-PGC-1α. Nuclear extracts 
were obtained by lysing cell in Buffer A (10mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 10mM KCl, 
1.5mM MgCl2, 0.5mM DTT, 0.25% IGEPAL (v/v), 5mM NaF, 5mM β-glycerophosphate, 
5mM sodium butyrate and 10mM nicotinamide), supplemented with Protease Inhibitor 
Cocktail. Once cytoplasmic fractions were separated, nuclear pellets were lysed in Buffer B 
(20mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 125mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1mM DTT, 1% IGEPAL (v/v), 
10% glycerol (v/v), 5mM NaF, 5mM β-glycerophosphate, 5mM sodium butyrate and 10mM 
nicotinamide), supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail. FLAG-HA-PGC-1α was 
immunoprecipitated with FLAG beads overnight at 4°C. All beads were washed at last 3 
times in lysis buffer before eluting in sample loading buffer.
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis—Total RNA was extracted from cells or 
pulverized liver using TRIzol reagent (Ambion, Life Technologies), followed by cDNA 
preparation from 2 μg of total RNA with a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit 
(Applied Biosystems). cDNA products were quantified by real-time PCR using Power 
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on a CFX384 Real-Time PCR System 
(Bio-Rad). To calculate IC50 from C-80 dose response, curves were fit to the hill equation in 
a similar manner used to calculate estimated AC50 from the high-throughput qPCR screen. 
However, unlike the curves from the qPCR high-throughput screen, values of relative 
repression were used rather than of delta-Ct.
Transcriptional reporter assays—U-2 OS cells were transfected with a fixed amount of 
DNA. After 6 h medium was changed and compound treatment started. The following 
morning medium was changed again and fresh compound was added for additional 3 h after

 which cells were collected (24 h post transfection) with 1× Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). 
Firefly luciferase reporter was determined by addition of Luciferase Assay Substrate (Dual-
Luciferase Reporter Assay System, Promega) and quantification of luminescence on a 
FLUOstar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech). CMV-driven Renilla luciferase vector was 
cotransfected as an internal control. Data are presented as firefly luciferase reporter values 
normalized to Renilla values and are representative of at least two independent experiments.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation—Primary hepatocytes were fixed in 1% formaldehyde 
for 10 minutes at room temperature. Crosslinking was quenched by adding glycine to a final 
concentration of 125mM and rinsing twice with PBS. Cells were collected in PBS 
containing protease inhibitors followed by lysis in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) 
buffer (50mM HEPES pH, 7.9; 140mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 1% Triton X-100; 0.1% 
NaDOC, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and protease inhibitors). Chromatin was 
sheared by sonication with a Diagenode Biorupter for three cycles of 5 minutes (30 seconds 
on, 30 seconds off). Samples were clarified and chromatin immunoprecipitated overnight at 
4 °C with the indicated antibody. Immunecomplexes were recovered with Protein A 
magnetic beads (Dynabeads; Novex, Life Technologies) preblocked with salmon sperm 
DNA (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). Following extensive washes, immunoprecipitated 
DNA was then isolated with a Chelex. Input DNA was prepared from 10% of respective 
chromatin prior to precipitation. Immunoprecipitated DNA and input DNA were analyzed 
by quantitative real-time PCR with primers specific for the indicated region.
Adenovirus Injection to Mice—Virus was introduced to mice through the tail vein 
injection. Virus was thawed before injection and the desired amount of virus was diluted 
with saline to a final volume of 100 L per mouse. Each mouse was injected with 6*107 
pfu/g. SR-18292 treatment started on day 5 post infection.
Hyperinsulinemic-Euglycemic Clamp Studies—Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic 
clamps were performed on mice fed HFD for 16 weeks as previously described with minor 
modifications (Jurczak et al., 2012). Briefly, an indwelling catheter was surgically implanted 
in the right jugular vein 7 days prior to study. Three days before study, mice were injected 
with SR-18292 and vehicle control following the same protocol described above. Mice were 
fasted overnight prior to clamps and then infused with a fixed amount of insulin [4 mU/(kg-
min)] and a variable amount of 20% dextrose to maintain euglycemia. [3-H]glucose was 
included in the infusate to allow for the calculation of whole-body rates of glucose 
metabolism.
GCN5 activity assay—For determination of GCN5 HAT activity U-2 OS cells 
overexpressing Ad-GCN5 were treated with SR-18292 (10μM) for 18 h. Cells were lysed 
with buffer B (20mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 125mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1mM DTT, 1% 
IGEPAL (v/v), 10% glycerol (v/v), 5mM NaF, 5mM β-glycerophosphate, 5mM sodium 
butyrate and 10mM nicotinamide), supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail. FLAG-
GCN5 was immunoprecipitated with FLAG beads overnight at 4°C following multiple wash 
es with lysis buffer. GCN5 was then eluted using 3× FLAG peptide and the purified protein 
was used to determine HAT activity using the HAT Inhibitor Screening Assay Kit (Cayman 
Sharabi et al.

 Chemicals) per manufacturer instructions. To determine the potential effect of SR-18292 on 
GCN5 activity in vitro, GCN5 was purified from U-2 OS cells in a similar manner but 
without treatment with SR-18292.
Mass spectrometry—Gel bands were dehydrated with acetonitrile, dried and 
resuspended in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) containing 500 ng of sequencing-
grade trypsin (Promega) and incubated at 37°C for 8 hours. Digested samples were then 
loaded onto StageTips and desalted. Peptides were eluted with 50% acetonitrile, 5% formic 
acid, dried using a Speed-Vac apparatus, and resuspended in 25 l of HEPES, pH 8.5. 
Peptides were labeled with 6-plex tandem mass tag (TMT) reagents (Thermo Scientific, 
Rockford, IL). After 1 hour of incubation at room temperature, the reaction was quenched 
with hydroxylamine and acidification with formic acid to pH ~2. TMT labeled peptides were 
combined, desalted by StageTips, dried and resuspended in 10 l of 1% formic acid. All 
spectra were acquired using an Oribtrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) in 
line with an Easy-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) ultra-high pressure liquid 
chromatography (UHPLC) pump. TMT labeled peptides (4 l) were separated onto a 75 μM 
inner diameter column containing 1 cm of Magic C4 resin (5 m, 100 Å, Michrom 
Bioresources) followed by 35 cm of Sepax Technologies GP-C18 resin (1.8 m, 120 Å) with 
a gradient consisting of 4–30% (ACN, 0.125% FA) over 90 min at ~250 nl/min. For all LC-
MS/MS experiments, the mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode where 
the MS1 spectra was set at a resolution of 120,000, with an AGC target of 150,000 and a 
max injection time of 100 ms. The ten most intense ions were selected for MS2. MS1 
precursor ions were excluded using a dynamic window (60 seconds +/− 10 ppm) and the 
MS2 precursors were isolated with a quadrupole mass filter set to a width of 0.5 DA. For 
MS3 based TMT quantitation, MS2 spectra were collected at an AGC of 4000, max 
injection time of 150 ms, and CID collision energy set at 35%. MS3 spectra were acquired in 
the Orbitrap parameters where the HCD collision energy was increased to 55%. 
Synchronous-precursor-selection (SPS) was enabled to include up to six MS2 fragment ions 
for the MS3 spectrum. A compendium of in-house software was used to convert raw files to 
mzXML format that adjusted monoisotopic m/z measurements and corrected erroneous 
peptide charge state assignments (Huttlin et al., 2010). Assignment of MS2 spectra was 
performed using the SEQUEST algorithm. All searches utilized the human UniProt database 
(downloaded 6/10/2016) where reversed protein sequences and known contaminants 
(keratins, etc.) were included. SEQUEST searches were performed using a 10 ppm precursor 
ion tolerance and requiring each peptide’s N/C terminus to have trypic specificity and 
allowing up to three missed cleavages. TMT tags on lysine residues and the N-terminus 
(+229.162932 Da) was set as static modifications as well, while methionine oxidation 
(+15.99492 Da) and acetylation on lysine (−187.1523673 DA) was set as variable 
modifications. An MS spectra assignment false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 1% was 
achieved by applying the target-decoy database search strategy3 and acetylated peptides 
were also manually validated. For quantification, a 0.03 m/z window centered on the 
theoretical DA value of each reporter ion was utilized for the nearest maximal signal 
intensity. Reporter ion intensities were adjusted to correct for the isotopic impurities from 
the different TMT reagents as per manufacturer’s specifications. The signal to noise values 
for all peptides for PGC-1α were summed within each TMT channel and all acetylated

 peptides were normalized to that PGC-1α summed signal. For each peptide, a total 
minimum sum signal to noise value of 200 and an isolation purity greater than 70% was 
required.
Serum and liver biochemistry measurements—Serum samples were gathered from 
blood collected by cardiac puncture. Insulin was measured with Ultra Sensitive Mouse 
Insulin ELISA Kit (Crystal Chem, 90080). Kits used to measure alanine transaminase 
(EALT-100), aspartate transaminase (EASTR-100), lactate dehydrogenase (DLDH-100) 
were purchased from Bioassay Systems. Kits used to measure lactate (MAK 064), β- 
hydroxybutyrate (MAK 041), Triglycerides (TR0100) were purchased from Sigma. Kit used 
to measure cholesterol (C7510) was purchased from Pointe Scientific. Kit used to measure 
non-esterified fatty acids was purchased from Wako.
Cytotoxicity determination in primary hepatocytes—For cell viability 
determination using MTT, primary hepatocytes were seeded on a 96-well plate at 20,000 
cells/well. The following day cells were treated at different doses, as indicated, for 18 h 
following similar protocol described above for drug treatment of primary hepatocytes. 5μl of 
MTT reagent (5mg/ml) was then added to each well (n=4/dose) and cells were incubated for 
1h at 37°C. Medium was discarded and dye was extracted by adding 100μl DMSO to each 
well. For cytotoxicity determination using ToxiLight Non-destructive Cytotoxicity Bioassay, 
hepatocytes were seeded on a 6-well plate and treated with either SR-18292 (20μM) or 
cisplatin (50μM) for 18 h. 50 μl of medium was collected and used to measure cellular 
toxicity by adding 100 of adenylate kinase detection reagent (AKDR) and incubating 5 min 
at RT before measuring luminescence.
Quantification and statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc.) and are expressed as 
mean ± SEM. Two-tailed Student t tests, one-way ANOVA with either Tuckey or Dunnet or 
Two-way ANOVA with Sidak comparison test were used to compare means between groups 
as indicated; P < 0.05 was considered significant.

 Figure 1. AlphaLisa based high-throughput screen identifies small molecules with inhibitory 
effect on glucose production in isolated hepatocytes
See also Fig. S1.
(A) AlphaLisa assay was used to detect acetylation status of PGC-1α in lysates obtained 
from U-2 OS cells over expressing PGC-1α and GCN5.
(B) Scatter plot of primary screen results. A total of 741 compounds that induced acetylation 
signal by ≥50% compared to control were identified and considered active (red dots). Axes 
represent activity score (percentage change in acetylation relative to vehicle control).
(C) The effect of the primary screen hits on PGC-1α acetylation was re-tested in a dose 
response manner. Dose response curve of lead compound (C-80) is presented as an example.
(D) Isolated mouse primary hepatocytes were used to determine the effect of remaining hits 
on Pck1 and G6pc gene expression (see also figure S1C). Forskolin was used to induce Pck1 
and G6pc expression (considered as 100% activation) and cells were treated with each 
compound at dose. Data was fit to the Hill equation to calculate estimated AC50. A more 
accurate dose response curve of lead compound (C-80) was re-generated in-house. For 
further details, please refer to STAR methods.
(E) Repression of glucose production from hepatocytes following treatment with screen hits. 
Hepatocytes were infected with Ad-PGC-1α and Ad-GCN5 to induce glucose production. 
Cells were treated overnight with an overall of 19 compounds, that were identified in the 
qPCR assay. Pyruvate/lactate were used as substrates for glucose production. Compounds 
that significantly reduced glucose levels in the medium compared to DMSO control are 
presented.
