 Accelerated Fetal Growth Prior to
Diagnosis of Gestational Diabetes
Mellitus: A Prospective Cohort
Study of Nulliparous Women
Diabetes Care 2016;39:982–987 | DOI: 10.2337/dc16-0160
OBJECTIVE
To determine whether fetal overgrowth precedes the diagnosis of gestational
diabetes mellitus (GDM) and to quantify the interrelationships among fetal over-
growth, GDM, and maternal obesity.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
We conducted a prospective cohort study of unselected nulliparous women and
performed ultrasonic measurement of the fetal abdominal circumference (AC)
and head circumference (HC) at 20 and 28 weeks of gestational age (wkGA).
Exposures were diagnosis of GDM ‡28 wkGA and maternal obesity. The risk of
AC >90th and HC-to-AC ratio <10th percentile was modeled using log-binomial
regression, adjusted for maternal characteristics.
RESULTS
Of 4,069 women, 171 (4.2%) were diagnosed with GDM at ‡28 wkGA. There was
no association between fetal biometry at 20 wkGA and subsequent mater-
nal diagnosis of GDM. However, at 28 wkGA, there was an increased risk of
AC >90th percentile (adjusted relative risk 2.05 [95% CI 1.37–3.07]) and HC-to-AC
ratio <10th percentile (1.97 [1.30–2.99]). Maternal obesity showed similar asso-
ciations at 28 wkGA (2.04 [1.62–2.56] and 1.46 [1.12–1.90], respectively). The
combination of GDM and obesity was associated with an approximately fivefold
risk of AC >90th (4.52 [2.98–6.85]) and approximately threefold risk of HC-to-AC
ratio <10th percentile (2.80 [1.64–4.78]) at 28 wkGA. Fetal AC >90th percentile at
28 weeks was associated with an approximately fourfold risk of being large for
gestational age at birth.
CONCLUSIONS
Diagnosis of GDM is preceded by excessive growth of the fetal AC between 20 and
28 wkGA, and its effects on fetal growth are additive with the effects of maternal
obesity.
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common acquired medical
disorders of pregnancy (1), and the major complication of GDM is excessive fetal
growth. Low- and middle-income countries have a GDM prevalence similar to that in
high-income countries, although the prevalence is particularly high in Vietnam, India,
Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka (2). Pregnancies affected by GDM carry an increased risk of
adverse outcome for the mother and the offspring in the short term (1,3,4), and the

 offspring are at increased risk of child-
hood obesity in the long term (4). Large-
scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
have confirmed that screening and treat-
ment for GDM are associated with im-
proved short-term outcomes (5,6) but
have failed to show reduced rates of
childhood obesity (7,8). Current guide-
lines recommend screening women for
GDM between 24 and 28 weeks of gesta-
tional age (wkGA) (1,3). In practice, many
units screen at approximately 28 wkGA.
The aims of the present analysis were 1)
to determine whether the onset of fe-
tal overgrowth among women subse-
quently diagnosed with GDM preceded
the normal time of screening for the con-
dition and 2) to determine the interrela-
tionships between fetal overgrowth,
GDM, and maternal obesity.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Design
The Pregnancy Outcome Prediction
study was conducted at the Rosie Hos-
pital, Cambridge, U.K., and has previ-
ously been described in detail (9,10). In
brief, it was a prospective cohort study
of nulliparous women with a viable sin-
gleton pregnancy who attended the
hospital for their dating ultrasound
scan between 14 August 2008 and 31
July 2012. Blood was obtained at the
time of recruitment. Further participa-
tion in the study involved attending
the National Institute for Health Re-
search Cambridge Clinical Research Fa-
cility at ;20, ;28, and ;36 wkGA for
blood sampling and performance of ul-
trasound scans. Outcome data were
obtained by review of each woman’s pa-
per case record by research midwives
and by linkage to the hospital’s elec-
tronic databases. Ethics approval for
the study was given by the Cambridge-
shire 2 Research Ethics Committee (refer-
ence no.07/H0308/163),andallparticipants
provided written informed consent. The
reporting of this study conforms to the
STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting
of Observational Studies in Epidemiology)
statement.
Analysis of Fetal Growth
The conduct and descriptive data of the
research ultrasounds have previously
been described in detail (9,10). In brief,
gestational dating was performed using
ultrasound, and 99.5% of these examina-
tions were performed prior to 15 wkGA.
The current analysis focuses on the re-
sults of fetal biometry at 20 and 28
wkGA. All scans were performed on a
Voluson i (GE, Fairfield, CT). The data
from the 20 wkGA scan were from the
routine anomaly scan offered to all
women, and these results were revealed
to the women and clinical team. The data
from the 28 wkGA scan were fetal biom-
etry performed for the purposes of re-
search, and these results were blinded.
The fetal head circumference (HC) and
abdominal circumference (AC) were
measured using the ellipse function on
the machine at the standard anatomical
sites (11). We have previously shown
that these measurements have low in-
terobserver variability (10). To allow for
minor variations in the exact timing of
the 20 and 28 wkGA ultrasound scans,
all fetal biometry was expressed as ges-
tational age–adjusted SD scores (z scores),
using the distribution of the measure-
ments within the data set (10). The AC
growth velocity was quantified as the
difference between the AC z score at
28 wkGA and the AC z score at 20 wkGA.
This approach accounts for nonlinear
changes and the increasing variability
of biometric measurements by gesta-
tional age and makes different mea-
surements from different gestational
ages comparable (12,13). z scores for
HC, AC, and AC growth velocity were
categorized into deciles, using the dis-
tribution within the study cohort. The
highest decile of AC and AC growth ve-
locity and the lowest decile of HC-to-AC
ratio were defined as abnormal. Sex-
and gestational age–corrected birth
weight percentiles and z scores were
calculated using a population-based
U.K. reference (14).
Definitions
Maternal age was defined as age at re-
cruitment. BMI was calculated using
each woman’s measured height and
their measured weight on the day of
their booking scan. Maternal obesity
was defined as BMI $30 kg/m2. Mater-
nal weight gain was defined as the dif-
ference in measured weight at the time
of the 28 wkGA scan and the booking
scan. Maternal ethnicity was defined
by self-report in a questionnaire admin-
istered at the 20 wkGA scan. Large for
gestational age (LGA) was defined as a
sex- and gestational age–specific birth
weight percentile .90th.
Screening and Diagnosis of GDM
All pregnant women were offered screen-
ing at the first antenatal booking visit
with a random plasma glucose. Women
with random glucose .7.0 mmol/L
(.126 mg/dL) were offered a 75-g oral
glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Women
were screened again at ;28 wkGA, first
with a 50-g glucose challenge test (GCT),
followed by a 75-g OGTT if the GCT was
.7.7 mmol/L (.139 mg/dL), as previ-
ously described (15). Screening for
GDM was usually performed on the
same day as the 28-week ultrasound
scan, and GDM diagnosis was made
shortly after. Uptake of the GCT was
.85% (the exact proportion could not
be calculated, as some tests took place
in primary care). Between 2008 and
2010, GDM diagnosis was based on diag-
nostic criteria adapted from the World
Health Organization (WHO) (1999) rec-
ommendations: fasting, 1-h, and 2-h
glucose levels .6.1 (110 mg/dL), 10.0
(180 mg/dL), or 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL),
respectively. From 2011 onwards, these
were replaced with diagnostic criteria
adapted from the International Associa-
tion of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study
Groups’ recommendations: fasting, 1-h,
and 2-h glucose levels .5.3 (95 mg/dL),
10.0 (180 mg/dL), or 8.5 mmol/L
(153 mg/dL), respectively (16). Informa-
tion on the subsequent treatment of
GDM was obtained by individual review
of each patient’s clinical case record.
Treatment was generally informed and
monitored by home testing using a
glucometer, with fasting and 1-h post-
prandial measurements made four times
per day. All women diagnosed with GDM
were offered a postpartum 2-h, 75-g
fasting OGTT to exclude any ongoing
glycemic dysregulation (impaired fast-
ing hyperglycemia, impaired glucose
tolerance, or type 2 diabetes). This al-
lowed us to identify women who also
had abnormal glucose tolerance outside
pregnancy and, therefore, had nongesta-
tional glycemic dysregulation.
Exclusion Criteria
We excluded women who withdrew
from the study, who were lost to follow-
up,whofailedtoattendthe20or28wkGA
scan, who had preexisting diabetes or
had GDM diagnosed prior to 28 wkGA,
or had missing data on GDM or BMI. The

firmed to have a normal postpartum

 OGTT were included in the main analysis,
and the effect of excluding them was
assessed in a sensitivity analysis.
Statistical Analysis
Numerical data were compared using a
two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum test,
and categorical data were compared
using a Pearson x2 test with test for
trend, as appropriate. The associations
between the combination of GDM and
obesity and the indicators of abnormal
fetal growth were modeled using log-
binomial regression to obtain adjusted
relative risks. The relative risk of AC in
the top decile at 28 wkGA associated
with subsequent GDM was estimated
in the whole study group and stratified
by maternal obesity, the treatment
used, and the diagnostic criteria used
and confined to women with a normal
postpartum OGTT. Nonlinearity was as-
sessed using fractional polynomials, and
interactions were tested using the like-
lihood ratio test. Missing covariate data
were imputed using chained equations
(17). All analyses were adjusted for the
year of the 28 wkGA scan to take into
account any temporal changes in the inci-
dence, screening, diagnosis, or treatment
of GDM. Analyses were performed with
andwithoutadjustmentfor maternal age,
height,ethnicity,weight gain,and BMI, as
appropriate. Finally, the relative risk of
LGA at birth associated with the indicators
ofabnormal fetalgrowth wasestimated in
the group of women who were obese or
had GDM diagnosed at $28 wkGA. All
analyses used Stata, version 14.0.
RESULTS
Among 4,512 recruited women, a total
of 4,305 attended for their 28 wkGA
scan. (See Sovio et al. [10] for flow dia-
gram.) Of these, 7 withdrew, 6 failed to
attend their 20 wkGA scan, 188 deliv-
ered elsewhere, 14 had preexisting dia-
betes, 17 had GDM diagnosed prior to
28 wkGA, and 7 had missing data on
GDM or BMI. A total of 236 (5.5%) of
these women had one or more of the
exclusion criteria, leaving a study group
of 4,069, among whom 171 (4.2%) had
a diagnosis of GDM at $28 wkGA. Wom-
en who subsequently developed GDM
were older, were shorter, were more
likely to be obese, gained slightly less
weight, and were more likely to have in-
duced labor and cesarean delivery (Table
1). Their babies were born slightly smaller
but had higher birth weight z scores, and a
higher proportion of them were LGA.
At 20 wkGA, there were no significant
differences in fetal biometry associated
with subsequentGDM;however, the risks
of AC .90th and HC-to-AC ratio ,10th
percentile were increased in fetuses of
obese mothers (Table 2). At 28 wkGA,
subsequent GDM and maternal obesity
were each associated with an ;2.0-fold
risk of AC .90th and a 1.5- to 2.0-fold
risk of HC-to-AC ratio ,10th percentile.
The effects of obesity and subsequent
GDM were additive: the combination
was associated with an almost fivefold
risk of AC .90th and an almost threefold
risk of HC-to-AC ratio ,10th percentile
at 28 wkGA. Subsequent GDM and
maternal obesity were each associated
with an increased risk of AC growth veloc-
ity .90th percentile, and the combination
was associated with an almost threefold
risk.
There were no interactions between
the two exposures or between either
exposure and any of the maternal cova-
riates in their associations with fetal bi-
ometry (all P . 0.05). Of the 171 women
with GDM, 123 (72%) attended for a
postpartum 75-g fasting OGTT, and 116
of them had a normal result (fasting glu-
cose ,6.1 [110 mg/dL] and 2-h glu-
cose ,7.8 mmol/L [140 mg/dL]). The
proportion of AC .90th percentile in
the 116 women who had a normal post-
partum OGTT was similar to the 55
women who could not be confirmed to
have a normal postpartum OGTT (19.8
vs. 25.5%, P = 0.4). The relative risk of
AC .90th percentile associated with
subsequent GDM was similar when
stratified by maternal obesity, the treat-
ment used, and the diagnostic criteria
used and when the analysis was confined
to women with a normal postpartum
OGTT (Fig. 1). Of the 4,069 women in
the cohort, 749 (18.4%) had complete
data on the result of the 75-g fasting
OGTT. Of the 4,069 women, 194 (4.8%)
were deemed to screen positive using
the modified WHO (1999) criteria, where-
as 142 (3.5%) screened positive using
the modified International Associa-
tion of the Diabetes and Pregnancy
Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria. There
were 54 (1.3%) women who were
screen positive using the modified
WHO criteria but not the modified
IADPSG criteria and two (,0.1%)
women who were screen positive
using the modified IADPSG criteria
but not the modified WHO criteria.
Ultrasonic fetal biometry at 28 weeks
identified pregnancies at increased risk
of an LGA infant at delivery among the
672 women who were obese and/or
had a diagnosis of GDM $28 wkGA. AC
growth velocity .90th percentile was
associated with a twofold risk of LGA
(adjusted relative risk 1.87 [95% CI
1.05–3.35]), and AC .90th percentile
was associated with a fourfold risk of
LGA (3.86 [2.37–6.29]).
CONCLUSIONS
We found that excessive fetal growth
preceded clinical diagnosis of GDM. At
28 wkGA, the risks of AC .90th and HC-
to-AC ratio ,10th percentile were dou-
bled. No differences were apparent at
the time of the 20 wkGA scan. More-
over, fetuses of women who were sub-
sequently diagnosed with GDM had
increased growth velocity of the AC be-
tween 20 and 28 wkGA. These data sug-
gest that the onset of fetal growth
disorder in GDM predates the usual
time of screening. The current observa-
tions cannot be explained by misclassi-
fication of nongestational glycemic
dysregulation as GDM because the re-
sults were very similar when confined
to women with confirmed normal post-
partum glucose tolerance. A slightly dif-
ferent pattern was observed for maternal
obesity, as the fetuses of obese women
already demonstrated increased risks of
AC .90th and HC-to-AC ratio ,10th
percentile at 20 wkGA. However, obe-
sity was also associated with accelera-
ted growth between 20 and 28 wkGA.
Moreover, the effects of obesity and
GDM on fetal growth were additive.
Consequently, at 28 wkGA, the fetuses
of obese women who had a subsequent
diagnosis of GDM had an almost fivefold
risk of AC .90th and an almost threefold
risk of HC-to-AC ratio ,10th percentile.
Finally, among the population of women
with obesity and/or GDM, fetal AC .90th
percentileat28weeks andincreased fetal
AC growth velocity between 20 and
28 weeks were associated with an in-
creased risk of macrosomia at delivery.

 GDM take place between 24 and 28
wkGA. Practice differs internationally,
and between units within countries,
about whether biochemical screening
is universal, using a 50-g GCT, or targeted
at high-risk women using a 75-g fasting
OGTT. We use the former approach, as
previously described (15). Whichever
method is used, units typically screen
women at 28 wkGA. Our data suggest
that fetal growth is already abnormal at
28 wkGA in women subsequently diag-
nosed with GDM. Consequently, our
data suggest that screening prior to 28
wkGA may be one approach to improving
the short- and long-term outcomes of
pregnancies complicated by GDM. The
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has
previously observed that there is an ab-
sence of evidence regarding the effects of
earlier screening (1). Such an approach
may be particularly likely to improve out-
comes among obese women, as fetal
growth was already abnormal by 20 wkGA
among these women in the cohort. In
fact, the current data indicate that any
intervention aimed at reducing the risk
of LGA in the infants of obese women
may need to be implemented before
20 wkGA. Finally, the offspring of women
with GDM are at increased risk of child-
hood obesity (4), but RCTs have failed to
demonstrate that screening and inter-
vention in pregnancy reduce this risk
(7,8). The current data suggest a possible
explanation, namely, that screening and
intervention are taking place when the
effects of GDM are already manifested in
the fetus. Hence, the current findings in-
dicate that earlier screening and inter-
vention for GDM may result in better
short- and long-term outcomes. Testing
this hypothesis would be an appropriate
focus for future RCTs.
The main strengths of the current study
are that it was prospective and that ul-
trasonic fetal biometry was performed
at 20 and 28 wkGA in a large cohort of
unselected nulliparous women. Many
other studies of fetal growth in both
preexisting diabetes and GDM are con-
fined to women who had a diagnosis of
diabetes (19,20). It is clearly problem-
atic to define abnormal growth related
to diabetes in the absence of data on
fetal growth in women without diabe-
tes. Further strengths of the study are
that we had detailed clinical informa-
tion on the individual women. Hence,
we were able to analyze the results in

 relation to the treatment used for GDM
and in relation to the results of retest-
ing of women in the postpartum pe-
riod. Moreover, we had detailed
information on maternal covariates,
such as anthropometry, weight gain,
ethnicity, and age. The incidence of
GDM in our cohort was consistent with
U.K. rates of 3–5% when universal bio-
chemical screening is performed (21).
However, the women in the cohort
were mostly of white European ancestry.
We did not observe any statistically sig-
nificant interactions between ethnicity
and the exposures; however, the num-
bers were small. The current study re-
cruited women over a 4.5-year period.
During this period of time, there were
changes in the definition of GDM. In
the study cohort, 4.8% of the women
were deemed screen positive using the
modified WHO (1999) criteria, whereas
3.5% screened positive using the modi-
fied IADPSG criteria. There were 54
(1.3%) women who screened positive us-
ing the modified WHO (1999) criteria
but not the modified IADPSG crite-
ria and two (,0.1%) women who had
the opposite discrepancy. However,the
results were virtually identical when the
association was studied by year of the 28
wkGA scan. The Hyperglycemia and Ad-
verse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study
(22) demonstrated a continuum in the
risk of LGA in relation to hyperglycemia.
The similar findings in relation to AC com-
paring the modified WHO and the modi-
fied IADPSG criteria may reflect the fact
that women just below a given threshold
are very similar to those who lie just above
it. Finally, the use of the 50-g GCT ap-
proach is estimated to have a sensitivity
of 74% for GDM (23). It follows that
some of the women defined as normal in
the cohort may have had undiagnosed
GDM. Misclassification tends to lead to
underestimates of the strength of true as-
sociations, and it is possible that the asso-
ciations would have been even stronger
had all women been screened using a fast-
ing 75-g OGTT.
Diagnosis of GDM $28 wkGA is pre-
ceded by excessive fetal growth be-
tween 20 and 28 wkGA. Currently,
biochemical testing for GDM typically
takes place at ;28 wkGA. As fetal
growth is already abnormal at this
stage, it is plausible that earlier screen-
ing and intervention may result in lower
risks of adverse outcomes.

Data are associations expressed as relative risks (95% CI), referent to nonobese women with no diagnosis of GDM. *The sample size in the different analyses varies between 3,861 and 4,065, principally due
to missing values in biometric head measurements, which are dependent on fetal position. ACGV, AC growth velocity; HC:AC, HC-to-AC ratio. †Growth outcomes were dichotomized as .90th percentile
(AC and AC growth velocity) or ,10th percentile (HC:AC). The z score cutoff points were 1.2721 for AC at 20 wkGA, 21.2320 for HC-to-AC ratio at 20 wkGA, 1.2851 for AC growth velocity at 20–28 wkGA, 1.2851
for AC at 28 wkGA, and 21.2373 for HC-to-AC ratio at 28 wkGA. The mean (SD) gestational ages of the scans were 20.4 (0.5) and 28.3 (0.4) wkGA. ‡Adjusted for the year of the 28 wkGA scan, maternal age,
height, ethnicity (Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi vs. others), and weight gain. (All maternal characteristics listed in Table 1 were considered as potential confounders.) Multiple imputation was performed using
chained equations (m = 10 imputations). Predictive mean matching (k = 10 donors) and logistic regression were used in the imputation of weight gain and ethnicity, respectively. For improvement of the
imputation accuracy of the covariates, exposures and outcomes were also included in the imputation model, along with age when the woman stopped full-time education, since this variable was associated
with weight gain and ethnicity. $Significantly reduced HC-to-AC ratios were not due to smaller HC.

Figure 1—Stratified analysis of the associ-
ation between GDM and abdominal cir-
cumference (AC) .90th percentile at 28
wkGA. Points are adjusted relative risks,
and bars are 95% CI. Stratification was by
obesity (BMI $30 kg/m2), GDM treatment
type (diet only or medication [insulin or
metformin]), and year of the 28 wkGA
scan (2008–2010 diagnoses were based
on a modified version of the 1999 WHO
criteria: fasting, 1-h, and 2-h glucose levels
.6.1 mmol/L [110 mg/dL], 10.0 mmol/L
[180 mg/dL], or 7.8 mmol/L [140 mg/dL],
respectively, and 2011–2012 diagnoses
were based on the modified IADPSG crite-
ria: thresholds 5.3 mmol/L [95 mg/dL],
10.0 mmol/L [180 mg/dL], or 8.5 mmol/L
[153 mg/dL], respectively). One hun-
dred sixteen women had a diagnosis of
GDM in the pregnancy, attended for a
75-g fasting OGTT at ;6 weeks postpar-
tum, and had a normal result (fasting glu-
cose ,6.1 [110 mg/dL] and a 2-h glucose
,7.8 mmol/L [140 mg/dL]). Analyses were
adjusted for the year of the 28 wkGA scan,
maternal age, height, ethnicity (Indian/
Pakistani/Bangladeshi vs. others), weight
gain, and BMI, as appropriate (where the
analysis was not stratified by the respective
variable). GTT, glucose tolerance test.
