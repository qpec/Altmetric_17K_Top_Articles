Sleep is ubiquitous in animals and humans, but its function remains to be further determined.
The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis of sleep–wake regulation proposes a homeostatic
increase in net synaptic strength and cortical excitability along with decreased inducibility of
associative synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) due to saturation after sleep deprivation.
Here we use electrophysiological, behavioural and molecular indices to non-invasively study
net synaptic strength and LTP-like plasticity in humans after sleep and sleep deprivation. We
demonstrate indices of increased net synaptic strength (TMS intensity to elicit a predefined
amplitude of motor-evoked potential and EEG theta activity) and decreased LTP-like plasticity
(paired associative stimulation induced change in motor-evoked potential and memory
formation) after sleep deprivation. Changes in plasma BDNF are identified as a potential
mechanism. Our study indicates that sleep recalibrates homeostatic and associative synaptic
plasticity, believed to be the neural basis for adaptive behaviour, in humans.

 T
he activity-dependent refinement of transmission across
single synapses (associative plasticity) and the up- and
downscaling of overall synaptic strength (homeostatic
plasticity) represent basic mechanisms for neural network
function and adaptive behaviour1. Sleep has been shown to
strongly modulate synaptic plasticity2, but its effects on the
interplay of homeostatic and associative plasticity remain to be
further characterized.
The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis of sleep–wake regulation
posits that downscaling (that is, the decrease in strength) of
synapses that have been potentiated towards saturation during
wakefulness denotes a vital function of sleep3,4. Sleep-dependent
synaptic desaturation is thought to result in an improved signal-
to-noise ratio and a renewed capacity for the encoding of new
information through associative plasticity. This hypothesis is
supported by molecular and electrophysiological evidence from
animal studies5. Particularly, major markers of synaptic strength
show a wake-dependent rise and a sleep-dependent decline, such
as the slope of the local field potential elicited by electrical
stimulation in the rat cortex6, the level of GluR1-containing
AMPA receptors in the rat hippocampus and cortex6, cortical
spine density in adolescent mice7, and the number or size of
synapses in different neuronal circuits in flies8,9. In humans,
molecular mechanisms of synaptic homeostasis are not directly
accessible, but non-invasive (indirect) markers indicate net syna-
ptic potentiation during wakefulness and desaturation during
sleep. For instance, the slope of the electroencephalographic
(EEG) response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) that
shares properties with local field potentials in animal studies
increases with time awake and resets after sleep10. Further, EEG
theta activity, a marker for homeostatic sleep pressure (net
synaptic potentiation) in rats11 and humans12, increases with
time awake. Also other neurophysiological markers point to an
increase in cortical excitability (that is, the propensity for firing)
and overall synaptic strength, such as an increase in short-interval
intracortical facilitation and a decrease in short-interval intra-
cortical inhibition in M1 after sleep deprivation10,13–15.
These sleep–wake dependent homeostatic modifications of net
synaptic strength appear to refine the set-point for the induction
of input-specific associative plasticity at single synapses. Particu-
larly, Hebbian long-term potentiation (LTP) of glutamatergic
synaptic transmission is a key mechanism of associative plasticity
and a molecular correlate for learning and memory16. LTP is a
positive feedback process with a tendency to saturation17, which
appears
to
be
prevented
by
sleep-dependent
homeostatic
desaturation. Consistently, the induction of LTP via high-
frequency electrical stimulation in the motor cortex of rats is
partially occluded after prolonged wakefulness and restored after
sleep6. In humans, hippocampal activity assessed by functional
magnetic resonance imaging is reduced during the encoding of
episodic memory after sleep deprivation along with a deficit in the
formation of new memories as a behavioural correlate of activity-
dependent synaptic plasticity18. Yet memory is a complex
process including multi-synaptic pathways, and the sleep–wake-
dependent interplay of homeostatic and associative synaptic
plasticity in humans remains to be further determined. Associ-
ative LTP-like plasticity can be non-invasively induced in the
human cortex by the brain stimulation protocol paired associative
stimulation (PAS)19. The PAS-induced LTP-like plasticity shows
similar characteristics to LTP in animal slice experiments, namely
associativity, input-specificity and dependency on N-methyl-D-
aspartate receptor functioning20.
This study used TMS and EEG to investigate cortical
excitability/net synaptic strength (TMS intensity to elicit a
predefined amplitude of motor-evoked potential (MEP) and
EEG theta activity) and LTP-like plasticity (PAS induced change
in MEP and memory formation) in the human cortex. For the
first time to our knowledge, our study combines the assessment of
indices of homeostatic and associative synaptic plasticity in
humans. We demonstrate an increase in cortical excitability/net
synaptic strength and a partial occlusion of LTP-like plasticity
after sleep deprivation compared with sleep, indicating that sleep
recalibrates synaptic plasticity in the human cortex.
Results
Increased net synaptic strength after sleep deprivation. TMS
and wake EEG were investigated as non-invasive indices of
cortical excitability/net synaptic strength in 20 healthy partici-
pants in a repeated-measures protocol after one night of sleep and
one night of sleep deprivation (counterbalanced order with
one-week interval).
TMS was used to elicit MEPs of the abductor pollicis brevis
(APB) muscle of the left hand. The stimulation intensity adjusted
to elicit comparable baseline MEP amplitudes before PAS
(see Supplementary Table 1) was significantly lower in the
sleep deprivation condition compared with the sleep condition
(t19 ¼ � 2.46, P ¼ 0.023; Fig. 1a), indicative for an increased
cortical excitability after one night of sleep deprivation. There was
no difference in the resting motor threshold (RMT) before PAS
between the two conditions (sleep deprivation: 35.9±3.7% of
maximum stimulator output, MSO; sleep: 36.7±5.5% MSO;
t19 ¼ � 0.5, P ¼ 0.624).
All participants completed a wake EEG protocol to assess
power density in the 3.5–8 Hz (theta) frequency range that has
been described as a marker for the buildup of the homeostatic

 process S of sleep regulation in rats11 and humans12, which in
turn has recently been proposed to reflect the level of net synaptic
strength during wakefulness4. The wake EEG data demonstrated
a highly significant increase in EEG theta power after the sleep
deprivation compared to the sleep condition (t19 ¼ 5.1, Po0.001;
Fig. 1b). The full EEG spectrum is presented in Fig. 2. As shown,
exploratory analyses revealed condition effects in other frequency
ranges. However, we restricted the main analysis and inter-
pretation to the EEG theta range.
Decreased LTP-like plasticity after sleep deprivation. We used
PAS and a word-pair task to investigate indices of LTP-like
plasticity. The PAS protocol followed standard procedures and
consisted of 200 pairs of peripheral and cortical stimuli at a
frequency of 0.25 Hz (ref. 19). Peripheral electrical stimulation of
the median nerve at the left wrist was followed by TMS of the
right primary motor cortex (M1) at the optimal site to elicit MEPs
in the left APB muscle with an interstimulus interval (ISI) of
25 ms. At this ISI, the electrical stimulus slightly precedes
the TMS pulse in M1 leading to a LTP-like potentiation of
synaptic transmission that can be measured as an increase of the
TMS-evoked MEP amplitude in the corresponding hand muscle.
This PAS-induced LTP-like potentiation shows similar properties
to LTP in animal slice experiments20.
Figure 3a visualizes the observed decrease in LTP-like plasticity
induced by PAS after sleep deprivation compared with sleep, as
measured by the change in MEP amplitudes. The 2 � 4 repeated
measures analysis of variance (rm-ANOVA) showed a significant
effect for the factor Condition (F1,19 ¼ 7.5, P ¼ 0.013, Zp

(F3,57 ¼ 3.5, P ¼ 0.021, Zp
2 ¼ 0.156). Post hoc paired-sample t-tests
demonstrated similar baseline MEP amplitudes before PAS and a
significantly higher MEP amplitude at post 2 after sleep compared
with sleep deprivation (see Supplementary Table 1). This effect
was driven by a LTP-like increase in MEP amplitude at post
2 relative to baseline in the sleep condition (t19 ¼ 2.6, P ¼ 0.018),
and a decrease in MEP amplitude at post 2 after sleep deprivation
(t19 ¼ � 2.8, P ¼ 0.013). Also at post 1, there was a significant
decrease in MEP amplitude compared to baseline in the sleep
deprivation condition (t19 ¼ � 2.2, P ¼ 0.039). The other con-
trasts did not reach statistical significance.
To further characterize the response pattern to the PAS
protocol at the single-subject level (Fig. 3b), we calculated the
ratio of mean MEP amplitudes post-PAS (averaged across post
1–3) to MEP pre-PAS, with a ratio 41.0 indicating a LTP-like
increase and a ratio o1.0 indicating a long-term depression
(LTD)-like decrease in MEP amplitudes21. The distribution of the
LTP-like increase and LTD-like decrease after PAS was signi-
ficantly inverse after sleep and sleep deprivation (Fig. 3b): After
sleep, 14 participants (70%) showed an LTP-like increase and six
participants (30%) showed an LTD-like decrease, whereas after
sleep deprivation only five participants (25%) showed an LTP-like
increase and 15 participants (75%) showed an LTD-like decrease
(w21 ¼ 8.1,
P ¼ .004).
There
was
no

correlation
between the baseline MEP amplitude (pre-PAS) and the mean
MEP amplitudes post-PAS (sleep: r ¼ � 0.32, P ¼ 0.168; sleep
deprivation: r ¼ � 0.25, P ¼ 0.279).
A word-pair task was used to assess declarative memory
as a proxy of synaptic plasticity in a hippocampal-neocortical
network22. In the word-pair task, 46 semantically unrelated word-
pairs were randomly presented on a computer screen. Imme-
diately after the presentation session, participants had to name
the second word upon presentation of the first word (cued recall).
Three presentation/recall sessions were conducted and the
number of correctly recalled words in each session was reco-
rded. Consistent with the notion of a partial occlusion of LTP-like
plasticity after sleep deprivation, participants demonstrated
reduced memory acquisition in the word-pair task after sleep
deprivation. A 2 � 3 rm-ANOVA with the within-subject factors
Condition (sleep, sleep deprivation) and Session (sessions 1–3)
and the number of correctly recalled word-pairs in each session as
the dependent variable revealed significant main effects for the
factors Condition (F1,19 ¼ 6.8, P ¼ 0.018, Zp
2 ¼ 0.262) and Session

the sleep deprivation compared with the sleep condition (Fig. 3c).
Potential modulators of synaptic plasticity. To investigate
the impact of the sleep and sleep deprivation condition on brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cortisol and vigilance, we
used paired sample t-tests (Fig. 4a,b). The BDNF plasma level was
significantly lower after sleep deprivation (259.5±162.8 pg ml � 1)
compared
with
sleep
(379.6±220.1 pg ml � 1)
(t19 ¼ � 3.37,
P ¼ 0.003; Fig. 4a).

and
0800 h
(sleep:
24.5±8.9 nmol l � 1, sleep deprivation: 24.6±8.8 nmol l � 1) did
not differ between the conditions (for both time points: P40.05;
results not visualized). Comparable salivary cortisol levels in the
morning after one night of sleep deprivation are consistent with
prior studies23,24.
The Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) was used as a sensitive
measure of changes in vigilance based on reaction times25. PVT
response speed was significantly reduced (t18 ¼ � 7.1, Po0.001)
and the number of lapses was significantly increased (t18 ¼ 3.2,

condition (Fig. 4b).
To further investigate the relationship between potential
modulators of synaptic plasticity (BDNF, cortisol and vigilance)
and cortical excitability and LTP-like plasticity, exploratory linear
regression was used examining the degree to which the observed
changes in TMS intensity (to elicit baseline MEPs of about 1 mV
peak-to-peak (SI1mV) before PAS), EEG theta activity, MEP
amplitude and the number of correctly recalled word-pairs
between sleep and sleep deprivation relate to corresponding
changes in BDNF plasma level, cortisol level and PVT response
speed. Using difference values (sleep–sleep deprivation condi-
tion), a linear model was used to predict the difference in each of
the four dependent variables using the differences in the three
independent variables.
In a first regression model with TMS intensity as the dependent
variable, the change in BDNF plasma level was a significant
predictor
of
the
change
in
TMS
intensity
(b ¼ � 0.565,
P ¼ 0.011), such that a higher decrease in BDNF plasma level
after sleep deprivation was associated with a lower decrease in
TMS intensity (lower increase in cortical excitability). The change
in cortisol (b ¼ � 0.256, P ¼ 0.207) and vigilance (b ¼ � 0.213,
P ¼ 0.291) did not reach significance. The proportion of the
explained variance (R2) was 44%. In a second, third and fourth
regression model with the change in EEG theta activity, the
change in MEP amplitudes and the change in correctly recalled
word-pairs as the dependent variables, no predictor variable
reached significance (for all: PZ0.05).
The BDNF genotype analysis revealed 12 val/val homozygotes,
seven val/met heterozygotes, and one met/met homozygote
participant. To explore whether the BDNF genotype impacts
cortical excitability and LTP-like plasticity, we conducted three
separate multivariate ANOVAs, one for each condition and one
for the change between conditions (using difference values:
sleep—sleep deprivation condition), with the between-subject
factor Genotype (val/val versus met carriers) and TMS intensity,
EEG theta activity and mean MEP amplitude as the dependent
variables. There was no significant effect for the factor Genotype
(for all: P40.05).
Discussion
This study demonstrates indices of decreased LTP-like plasticity
and increased net synaptic strength in the human cortex after
sleep deprivation. As such, our study provides first evidence for a
sleep–wake-dependent dissociation of associative and homeo-
static synaptic plasticity in humans.

 The propensity of the brain to express associative synaptic
plasticity, the molecular basis for adaptive behaviour, appears to
depend on the prior history of the sleep/wake state. Because
synaptic plasticity cannot directly be quantified in humans, we
assessed the PAS-induced change in MEP amplitude that shares
key properties with LTP in vitro, namely associativity, coopera-
tivity and input-specificity19,26. We demonstrate, for the first
time, a partial occlusion of LTP-like plasticity after sleep
deprivation in the human cortex. This extends in vivo6 and
in vitro studies in rats27–29 showing impaired induction of
synaptic LTP after sleep deprivation. We further demonstrate a
significant deficit in the encoding of declarative memory after
sleep deprivation (word-pair task), which is thought to depend on
the induction of LTP in a hippocampal-neocortical network30.
This confirms prior work on declarative memory18 and suggests
that basic deficits in associative synaptic plasticity after sleep
deprivation, as demonstrated by PAS, also translate to the
behavioural level.
The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis proposes that homeostatic
modifications of net synaptic strength across the sleep–wake cycle
define the set-point for the induction of associative plasticity5. Our
results support this notion by demonstrating markers of increased
cortical
excitability
and
net
synaptic
strength
after
sleep
deprivation. Particularly, we confirm enhanced wake EEG theta
activity after sleep deprivation12,31. This EEG signature has been
shown to closely correlate with a major marker of net synaptic
strength in humans, that is, EEG slow wave activity during sleep12.
We further demonstrate increased cortical excitability based on an
attenuated stimulation intensity of TMS pulses to elicit a predefined
amplitude of MEPs (before PAS) after sleep deprivation. In line
with previous work13,14,32–33, a marker of axon membrane
excitability (RMT) was not affected by sleep deprivation. Future
studies are needed to further investigate potential other mecha-
nisms of excitability changes, such as intracortical inhibition.
Together, we demonstrate markers of increased excitability along
with decreased inducibility of LTP-like plasticity in the human
cortex after sleep deprivation.
Our results, together with prior work, lead us to propose a
sleep–wake dependent window of optimal associative plasticity
(‘happy medium’), with attenuated inducibility of LTP both
directly after sleep (insufficient upscaling) and after extended
wakefulness (excessive upscaling and saturation) (Fig. 5). This
idea is supported by reduced LTP-like plasticity in the morning
and facilitated LTP-like plasticity in the evening (assessed by
PAS) in healthy humans34. Decreased LTP in rats6 and LTP-like
plasticity in our study after extended wakefulness is proposed to
result from a shift out of the window of optimal associative
plasticity.
With regard to potential mechanisms, BDNF plasma levels
were significantly decreased after sleep deprivation compared
with sleep. Interestingly, we observed that a stronger decrease in
BDNF plasma level after sleep deprivation was associated with a
smaller increase in cortical excitability as measured by TMS. We
speculate that a pronounced decline in BDNF across sustained
wakefulness might protect individuals from excessive upscaling
and related shortcomings, such as saturation and impaired
information processing. Whereas individuals with high BDNF
activity outperform those with low activity under standard
daytime conditions35, this advantage might be inversed after
prolonged wakefulness. This could complement our picture of the
advantages and disadvantages of high and low BDNF activity.
Future studies are needed to further test this speculation. Changes
in cortisol and vigilance did not significantly explain the changes
in cortical excitability or LTP-inducibility in the current study.
To date, there is an inconclusive debate on how distinct
measures of plasticity in different neural networks might relate to
each other. Studies indicate that LTP is an omnipresent
mechanism of plasticity in the brain36. Particularly, LTP-like
effects have been observed in several neuronal networks in
humans, for example, in the visual cortex, the motor cortex and
the hippocampal-neocortical network. However, the paradigms
used to induce these effects are highly heterogeneous (presumably
with different sensitivities), and the complexity of the networks
involved varies from a few synapses to extended neural networks.
Thus in many studies, including ours, different measures used to
index plasticity did not closely correlate. For example, LTP-like
plasticity induced by PAS did not correlate with the performance
in a motor learning task37,38 or verbal learning39. Nevertheless,
these forms of plasticity probably share LTP at the molecular level
as a common mechanism and the development of more sensitive
measures is needed.
Of particular note, we observed inverse effects of the PAS
protocol after sleep and sleep deprivation (Fig. 3b). MEP
amplitudes increased in 70% of the participants after sleep
(LTP-like), whereas MEP amplitudes decreased in 75% of the
participants after sleep deprivation (LTD-like) using the same
PAS protocol. In fact, some evidence indicates that the induction
of
LTD
is
facilitated
after
sleep
deprivation
in
the
rat
hippocampus40–42. One possible explanation is provided by the
Bienenstock–Cooper–Munro theory of bidirectional synaptic
plasticity. The Bienenstock–Cooper–Munro theory proposes
that the threshold for LTP/LTD induction is adjusted to the
level of prior postsynaptic activity43. Extensive wakefulness might
cause high postsynaptic plasticity and shift the likelihood
threshold from LTP to LTD. Further studies are needed to test
this
speculation.
Another
explanation
for
facilitated
LTD
induction after sleep deprivation might be provided by sleep–
wake-dependent changes in neural bistability. This refers to
switches between on- and off-states of neural populations with an
increased incidence of local off-states with increasing sleep
pressure (‘local sleep’)44. After sleep deprivation, presynaptic
activity elicited by the TMS stimulus might coincide with

Sleep deprivation eventually leads to synaptic saturation and deficient
LTP inducibility.

 a hyperpolarized down-state of the postsynaptic membrane (that
could even be triggered by the peripherally induced volley of the
PAS protocol), a classic precondition for LTD. However, this
latter idea of local sleep cannot explain why PAS effectiveness is
higher in the evening than in the morning after normal sleep.
Moreover, increased bistability would be expected to result in
increased variability between individual MEP responses in the
sleep deprivation compared to the sleep condition, which was not
the case in the present study. Future studies are needed to
disentangle the mechanisms of the observed decrease in MEP
amplitudes after sleep deprivation.
The current line of research has important clinical implica-
tions. In modern society, chronic sleep loss is a highly prevalent
problem. Therefore, it is crucial to further delineate the impact of
sleep on healthy performance and underlying mechanisms, such
as required for school, work or social life. In addition, further
characterization of homeostatic and associative plasticity across
the sleep–wake cycle might have interesting implications for
neuropsychiatric disorders. For instance, in patients with major
depressive disorder, the inducibility of LTP-like plasticity is
impaired compared with controls38,45. Conceivably, therapeutic
sleep deprivation, an effective treatment with rapid onset in major
depressive disorder, might shift the initially deficient LTP indu-
cibility into a more favourable window of associative plasticity46.
In conclusion, this is the first study to demonstrate a sleep–
wake-dependent dissociation of homeostatic and associative
synaptic plasticity in the human cortex with enhanced cortical
excitability and a partial occlusion of associative LTP-like
plasticity after sleep deprivation. Further investigation of the
interplay of different types of plasticity and its modulation by
sleep might represent a significant step towards a better
understanding of basic mechanisms of healthy performance and
potential alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders.
Methods
Participants. Twenty healthy university students participated in the study
(11 males, 9 females, age: 22.0±1.7 years, age range: 19–25 years). All the
participants were right-handed, non-smokers and free of any mental or somatic
disorder or substance/medication use. All the participants maintained a regular
sleep–wake schedule before and during the study, as documented by sleep diaries.
The participants were recruited from the community and compensated for parti-
cipation. The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee at the University
Medical Center Freiburg and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki. All the participants provided written informed consent before
participation.
Study design. The participants underwent a screening session and a repeated-
measures electrophysiological, behavioural and molecular study protocol (Fig. 6)
after one night of normal nighttime sleep at home (self-reported total sleep time
6.7±0.6 h, range 5.4–7.5 h) and one night of total sleep deprivation (T1 and T2).
At screening, the participants obtained a sleep diary for 2 weeks to monitor
sleep–wake behaviour across the study. T1 and T2 took place seven and 14 days,
respectively, after screening. The night before T1 and T2, participants either slept
about 7 h at home or underwent one night of total sleep deprivation at the
Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy with standardized activities and
continuous supervision by staff members. The order of the sleep and sleep
deprivation condition was counterbalanced. Screening comprised the Composite
International Diagnostic Interview to exclude any mental disorders and the Beck
Depression Inventory. The Edinburgh Handedness Inventory was used to ensure
that all the participants were right-handed. A TMS screening comprised questions
concerning the safety of TMS. A few magnetic stimuli were administered to the
primary motor cortex (M1) to ensure that TMS was applicable. The Pittsburgh
Sleep Quality Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale were used to detect any
sleep-related pathology.
Indices of net synaptic strength. TMS was applied using a figure-of-eight
stimulation coil with an outer diameter of 90 mm that was centred tangentially on
the skull over the right primary motor cortex (M1) with the handle pointing in a
posterior direction and laterally at an angle of 45� away from the midline. The coil
was connected to a Magstim 200 stimulator (The Magstim Company Ltd.,
Whitland, UK) with a monophasic current waveform. By moving the coil over M1
while administering stimuli of suprathreshold intensity at 0.25 Hz, the optimal coil
position for eliciting MEPs of maximal amplitude of the left APB muscle was
identified (‘hotspot’). The coil position was recorded using a stereotaxic, optically
tracked navigation system to reduce experimenter bias, consisting of a camera
(Polaris Vicra P6, NDI, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada), custom-made software
(BrainView, Fraunhofer Institute, Stuttgart, Germany) and passive sphere
markers47, and kept constant throughout the measurements. RMT was determined
using a maximum-likelihood threshold-hunting paradigm48 that consisted of 16
TMS stimuli at 0.25 Hz starting at 45% MSO. The stimulation intensity was
adjusted at the beginning of each condition (sleep, sleep deprivation) to elicit MEPs
with peak-to-peak amplitudes of on average 600–1,400 mV (SI1mV) and was kept
constant throughout all measurements within each condition to assess changes in
mean MEP amplitudes. To adjust stimulation intensity, 20 MEPs were recorded
with a stimulation intensity of 120% RMT. If the mean amplitude of the 20 MEPs
was o600 mV or 41,400 mV, the stimulation intensity was increased or decreased,
respectively, and another 20 MEPs were recorded until the correct intensity was
determined. At each TMS measurement (baseline, post 1, post 2, post 3), 20 TMS
pulses were administered at a frequency of 0.1 Hz. The MEP amplitudes were
determined by measuring the two highest peaks of opposite polarity. Raw examples
of individual MEP traces are presented in Fig. 7. For each TMS measurement
(baseline, post 1, post 2, post 3), the mean MEP amplitude was calculated by
averaging the individual peak-to-peak amplitudes of the 20 TMS pulses. To
estimate cortical excitability, we compared the stimulation intensity adjusted
to elicit a mean MEP amplitude of about 1 mV peak-to-peak (SI1mV) in each
condition before PAS between the two conditions.
MEPs were recorded from the left APB muscle using silver/silver chloride
electrodes (AMBU, Ballerup, Denmark) in a belly-tendon montage. The
participants were instructed to relax the target muscle during all measurements.

stimulation (PAS) and three post measurements (2, 30 and 60 min after the end of PAS). Salivary cortisol was assessed at 0600 h and 0800 h. After the
TMS measurement, 15 ml of blood was taken to determine brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plasma concentration and BDNF genotype. Last, a
declarative memory task (word-pair task) was conducted.

 The overall EMG level before the application of a TMS stimulus was near zero and
did not differ between the conditions. The EMG signals were band-pass filtered
(20–2,000 Hz) and amplified using an Ekida DC universal amplifier (Ekida GmbH,
Helmstadt, Germany), digitized at a 5 kHz sampling rate using a MICRO1401mkII
data acquisition unit (Cambridge Electronic Design Ltd., Cambridge, UK) and
stored on a computer for online visual display and later offline analysis using Signal
Software version 3 (CED Ltd, UK). MEPs were excluded from the analysis if the
muscle activity exceeded a value of 0.05 mV in a time frame 100 ms before the TMS
stimulus. Very few MEPs were excluded (sleep condition: 0.75%, 12 out of 1,600;
sleep deprivation condition: 0.44%, 7 out of 1,600).
The wake EEG was recorded from the electrode positions O1 and O2 referenced
to Fpz according to the 10–20 system49 using a Neuroscan SynAmps amplifier
(Compumedics Neuroscan, Charlotte, NC, USA). The EEG recordings were
performed for a 2.5 min period of sustained wakefulness and the average spectral
power in the EEG theta frequency band (3.5–8 Hz) of artifact-free 2 s epochs was
calculated.
Indices of LTP-like plasticity. The PAS protocol closely followed standard
procedures19. PAS consisted of 200 pairs of peripheral and cortical stimuli at a
frequency of 0.25 Hz. Peripheral electrical stimulation of the median nerve at the
left wrist was followed by TMS of the right M1 at the optimal site to elicit MEPs in
the left APB muscle with an ISI of 25 ms. Electrical stimulation was applied
through a Digitimer DS7 electrical stimulator (Digitimer Ltd., Welwyn Garden
City, Hertfordshire, UK) at the optimal stimulation site at the wrist using a bipolar
electrode with the cathode proximal. Stimuli were constant current square wave
pulses with a duration of 1,000 ms at an intensity of 300% of the sensory perceptual
threshold. TMS intensity was set at SI1mV as determined before PAS. Taking into
account that the level of attention may influence PAS effectiveness50, the
participants were instructed to direct their attention to the stimulated hand and
count silently the number of randomly administered electrical stimuli applied to
the thumb of the stimulated hand using a second bipolar electrode (200%
perceptual threshold, constant current square wave pulses, duration 200 ms,
cathode proximal). Four electrical stimuli were applied at the midpoint of the
interval between successive paired stimuli during the stimulation protocol. The
participants were asked to report the number of stimuli after the PAS intervention.
As an index of LTP-like plasticity, we analysed the change in MEP amplitude after
the PAS intervention (post 1–3) compared with pre-PAS.
In the word-pair task, 46 semantically unrelated word-pairs were randomly
presented on a computer screen using the Presentation software. Each word-pair
was presented for 5,000 ms, separated by an ISI of 1,000 ms. Presentation of the
word-pairs was immediately followed by cued recall, that is, participants were
required to name the second word upon presentation of the first word. Correct and
incorrect responses were noted by staff members without feedback. Three
presentation/recall trials were conducted. Recall performance was assessed as the
number of correctly recalled words in each trial. To control for primacy and
recency effects, four additional word-pairs at the beginning and at the end were not
included in the analysis. Parallel versions of the task were used for repeated
measurements.
Potential modulators of synaptic plasticity. BDNF has emerged as an important
modulator of synaptic plasticity51. We analysed the BDNF genotype and plasma
levels. Genomic DNA was purified from 3 ml of whole blood. Fifty nanograms of
genomic DNA was used to amplify a 281 bp polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
product surrounding the site of the Val66Met polymorphism for subsequent direct
sequencing by GATC Biotech in Konstanz, Germany. Direct sequencing was
performed with 3.2 pmol of the reverse primer used for initial PCR amplification.
The genotype of each participant was determined following two independent
rounds of direct sequencing52. The following primers were used: 50-CAGGTGA
GAAGAGTGATGACCA-30 (forward) and 50-GCATCACCCTGGACGTGTAC-30
(reversed). BDNF plasma levels were measured by Emax ImmunoAssay Systems
ELISAs (G7610) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
To control for possible effects of cortisol levels, saliva specimens were collected
at 0600 h (before breakfast) and 0800 h (1 h after breakfast) at T1 and T2. All the
samples were stored at � 20 �C until the analysis at the BioInnovationsZentrum
Dresden, Germany. After thawing, salivettes were centrifuged at 3,000g for 5 min,
which resulted in a clear supernatant of low viscosity. Salivary concentrations were
measured using a commercially available chemiluminescence immunoassay with
high sensitivity (IBL International, Hamburg, Germany). The intra- and interassay
coefficients of variation for cortisol were below 8%.
To control for possible effects of vigilance, the PVT was used. The participants
were instructed to press a response button as fast as possible to stop a visual
millisecond (ms) counter on a computer screen starting at a variable ISI of
2,000–10,000 ms. In response to the reaction, the counter display stopped, allowing
the participant to read the reaction time (RT) for 1,000 ms before restart. The total
test duration was 10 min. Mean response speed (1,000 ms per RT; 100 ms rRT
o500 ms) and number of lapses (errors of omission; RTs Z500 ms) were analysed.

 inducibility of LTP-like plasticity after sleep deprivation compared with sleep,
a 2 � 4 rm-ANOVA with the within-subject factors Condition (sleep, sleep
deprivation) and Time (baseline, post 1, post 2, post 3) and MEP amplitudes as the
primary end point was conducted. Power calculation was done for this analysis
(F test with repeated measures, G*Power 3.1.9.2). To compare memory perfor-
mance as a secondary index, a 2 � 3 rm-ANOVA with the within-subject factors
Condition (sleep, sleep deprivation) and Session (sessions 1–3) and the number of
correctly recalled word-pairs in each trial as the dependent variable was conducted.
Post hoc paired-sample t-tests were conducted for significant rm-ANOVA effects.
To test our second hypothesis of increased cortical excitability/net synaptic
strength after sleep deprivation compared with sleep, a paired-sample t-test was
used to compare TMS intensity to elicit MEPs of about 1 mV peak-to-peak (SI1mV)
as the primary end point. To compare EEG theta power (3.5–8 Hz) as a secondary
index, a paired-sample t-test was used. Partial eta square values (Zp
2) were calculated
as effect sizes for ANOVAs (low: o0.06; medium: Z0.06 and o0.14; large:
Z0.14). The level of statistical significance was set at Po0.05 (two-tailed).
