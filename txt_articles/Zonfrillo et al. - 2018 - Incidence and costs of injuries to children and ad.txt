Incidence and costs of injuries to children
and adults in the United States

Abstract
Background: Injuries are a leading cause of death and acquired disability, and result in significant medical
spending. Prior estimates of injury-related cost have been limited by older data, for certain population, or specific
mechanisms.
Findings: This study estimated the incidence of hospital-treated nonfatal injuries in the United States (US) in 2013
and the related comprehensive costs. Injury-related emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations were
identified using 2013 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) data. Models estimated the costs of medical
spending and lost future work due to injuries in 2013 U.S. dollars. A total of 31,038,072 nonfatal injury-related hospitalizations
and ED visits were identified, representing 9.8 per 100 people. Hospital-treated nonfatal injuries cost an estimated $1.853
trillion, including $168 billion in medical spending, $223 billion in work losses, and $1.461 trillion in quality of life losses.
Conclusions: Approximately one in 10 individuals in the US is treated in the hospital for injury each year, with high
corresponding costs. These data support priority-setting to reduce the injury burden in the US.
Background
Injuries are a leading cause of death and acquired dis-
ability in children and adults, and result in significant
medical
spending
nationwide.
Prior
estimates
of
injury-related cost have been from much older data
(Danseco et al. 2000; Miller et al. 2000; Corso et al.
2006), for certain populations (e.g., children (Miller et al.
2000; Zaloshnja et al. 2012; Roy et al. 2008), Medicaid
recipients (Roy et al. 2008)), for certain mechanisms
(e.g., consumer products (Lawrence and Miller, 2014),
agricultural (Zaloshnja et al. 2012)), or for cost totals
that only include medical care (Dieleman et al. 2016).
This study provides contemporary national estimates of
the incidence of hospital-treated nonfatal injuries for
children and adults in the United States in 2013 and the
related comprehensive costs by age, household income,
payer, metropolitan residence, disposition, injury severity
score, injury mechanism and injury intent. While inci-
dence describes the magnitude of the problem, costs
provide a better measure of burden by accounting for
multiple injury consequences – e.g., severity, disability –
in a single unit of measurement.
Methods
Injury-related emergency department (ED) visits and
hospitalizations were identified using 2013 Healthcare
Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) sample-based ED
(Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ),
n.d.) and inpatient (Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality (AHRQ)a, n.d.) datasets. This study used deiden-
tified administrative data and was exempt from review
by our institution. Injuries were defined as diagnoses
800–995 in the International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision, excluding late effects, 905–909. We used
the standard external-cause matrix from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), n.d.-a; Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), n.d.-b).
We applied an established US injury cost model to the
HCUP datasets to estimate the costs of injuries in
2013 U.S. dollars (Lawrence et al. 2015; Spicer et al.
2011). The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
(AHRQ) weights HCUP Nationwide Emergency Depart-
ment Sample (NEDS) and Nationwide Inpatient Sample
(NIS) data to provide national estimates. 2014 NEDS

 estimates are based on sampling non-admitted cases
from all EDs in 34 states. 2014 NIS estimates are based
on a one-in-five random sample of inpatient discharges
from every hospital in 44 states and the District of
Columbia. (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
(AHRQ), n.d. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
(AHRQ)a, n.d.).
Costs include medical spending and lost future work. In
addition, we take a societal perspective by including the
estimated value of lost quality of life. Medicalspending

 includes hospital and professional services, emergency
transport, rehabilitation, prescriptions, home health care,
and medical equipment. Lost future work includes future
value of work that patients would be unable to do if they
were killed or permanently disabled. Future costs were

(Lawrence and Miller 2014). We valued quality of life lost
with
a
widely
published
value
of
$152,733
per
quality-adjusted life year, net of work loss (Miller and
Hendrie, 2013). We used the same value per QALY of
present-value life expectancy for all people. Because
life-expectancy varies by age and sex, the total QALY loss
to a death or permanently disabling injury also does.
Results
Incidence
A total of 31,038,072 nonfatal injury-related hospitaliza-
tions and ED visits were identified in 2013 (Table 1).
This represents 9.8 per 100 people.
Costs
Hospital-treated nonfatal injuries in 2013 cost an esti-
mated $1.853 trillion, including $168 billion in medical
spending, $223 billion in work losses, and quality of life
losses valued at $1.461 trillion (Table 1). The total esti-
mated cost per injury was approximately $59,700, in-
cluding approximately $5400 in medical spending, $7200
in lost future work and $47,100 in quality of life losses.
The total costs per injury were highest for the oldest and
youngest age groups; individuals < 1 year old ($97,623)
and 65 years and older ($71,493). Total cost per injury
was slightly higher for those with Medicare and Me-
dicaid versus those with commercial insurance or
other payer types. While 91.5% of patients with inju-
ries were discharged, this represented only 8.8% of
costs. In contrast, the 8.5% of patients admitted rep-
resented 91.2% of costs.
Falls and struck by/against injuries contributed to 35%
of nonfatal injury costs (Table 2) and were the leading
causes in all age groups (results not shown). The most
severe and debilitating injuries will result in higher costs.
Among hospital-treated nonfatal injuries, near-drownings,
self-harm, and firearm-related violence are the most
costly. The external cause of injury was not coded for
cases accounting for 9% of total injury costs.
Discussion
Approximately one in 10 individuals in the United States
is injured each year are treated in a hospital, with high
corresponding costs. Our calculated rate of 9.8 injuries
per 100 people in 2013 is nearly half that of the 18.135
injuries per 100 population estimate by Corso et al.
based on data from 2000. (Corso et al. 2006) While a
prior study of US spending on personal health care
found that injuries accounted for $168 billion (8%) of
the $2.1 trillion in medical spending in 2013, our com-
prehensive injury medical spending estimate exceeds
that, even while excluding the 12 million injuries treated
in physician’s offices and clinics. (Dieleman et al. 2016)
Limitations of the study include the absence of out-
patient and ambulatory data, as well as the possibility of
misclassification based on ICD codes.
These cost data from 2013 support priority-setting and
selection of interventions to reduce the burden of injury
in the United States.
