 What risks do herbal products pose to the
Australian community?
Roger W Byard1, Ian Musgrave1, Garth Maker2, Michael Bunce3
H
erbal medicines are plant-derived materials and prepara-
tions consumed for their presumed therapeutic or other
health benefits. They may consist of raw materials such as
bark, roots, leaves and seeds, or include processed ingredients in
capsules or tablets, teas, or powders. Some herbal preparations
may also contain declared or undeclared products derived from
endangered animals, such as the snow leopard.1
Unfortunately, some herbal products are problematic in terms of
their ingredients, effects and interactions with prescription medi-
cations. Complications associated with “non-medically qualified
healers, lack of product standards, undeclared ingredients, non-
disclosure of usage and long-term medication” have been identi-
fied.2 A survey of naturopaths and Western herbalists in Australia
has, however, revealed support for formal registration and for
evidence-based practice.3 A report published in 2016 detailed the
potentially serious side effects of herbal dietary supplements, such
as
sub-massive
hepatic
necrosis
necessitating
organ
trans-
plantation caused by ingestion of a weight loss supplement
containing garcinia cambogia (Garcinia gummi-gata).4
We undertook a literature review after searching general internet
and PubMed databases for selected terms and combinations of
terms, including “adverse event” and “herbal”, “complementary
and alternative medicine” (CAM) and “Australia”, “dietary sup-
plement”, “traditional Chinese medicine” (TCM), and “ayurvedic”,
as well as more specific clinical terms, such as “hepatotoxicity”. We
examined the range of problems that may be encountered with
preparations containing herbal materials, in order to determine the
nature of the risks they pose to the Australian public and to make
recommendations about their regulation.
Trends in use
An estimated 70e80% of the world’s population use non-Western
medicine in the form of herbal preparations for their primary
health care.5 The proportion of the Australian population using
herbal products as mono- or ancillary therapy increased from
48% in 1996 to 69% in 2005,6-8 with spending on complementary
medicine increasing by more than 100% between 1996 and 2004.6
Similar increases have been reported in many Western countries;
in the United States, spending on herbal preparations doubled
between 1997 and 2007.9
Despite these trends, there have been few recent investigations of the
specific problems associated with the use of herbal medicines, and
assessments of their safety rely on older studies. About 30% of
American patients use herbal medicines, often without the knowl-
edge of their treating doctor.10,11 In Australia, more than half of those
using complementary medicine (including herbal products) did not
informtheirdoctors,andtheyoftenusedsuchproductstogetherwith
conventional medications.6-8 There are a number of reasons for this
behaviour, including the belief that herbal preparations are natural
products that can be freely combined with pharmaceutical drugs, the
desire for a personal therapeutic regime, and a fear of disapproval or
ridicule by health professionals.12 Access to traditional medicines
does not require a prescription, and they are prominently advertised
in the popular media.
That side effects of herbal medicines used in traditional societies
have not been reported is often cited in favour of their safety, but the
lack of systematic observation has meant that even serious adverse
reactions, such as kidney failure and liver damage caused by Aris-
tolochia species, were unrecognised until recently.13,14 Further, this
argument overlooks the potential for serious interactions of herbal
preparations with prescription medications, the higher mortality
rates in traditional societies, and the effects of globalisation on the
content andqualityofherbalmedicines.The recentSansom reportto
the federal Minister for Health made a series of recommendations
about the regulation of complementary medicines in Australia,
including continued evaluation of ingredients, and permitting the
listing on packaging only of ingredients that have been approved for
medicinal purposes.15
The predominant user group of complementary medicines in
Australia comprises younger women (under 35 years old) with a
tertiary education.6-8,16,17 People with chronic diseases or comor-
bidities such as cancer, diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders or
mental illness frequently use complementary medicines.16 A study
of 10 011 Australian women aged 59e64 years found that 39% of
those with menopausal symptoms consulted complementary
medicine practitioners, and that 75% used self-prescribed com-
plementary therapies;18 53% of 1037 people with HIV attending
Abstract
Traditional herbal products are widely used in Australia to
treat a broad range of conditions and diseases. It is popularly
believed that these products are safer than prescribed drugs.
While many may be safe, it is worrying that the specific effects
and harmful interactions of a number of their components with
prescription medications is not well understood. Some
traditional herbal preparations contain heavy metals and toxic
chemicals, as well as naturally occurring organic toxins. The
effects of these substances can be dire, including acute hepatic
and renal failure, exacerbation of pre-existing conditions and
diseases, and even death. The content and quality of herbal
preparations are not tightly controlled, with some ingredients
either not listed or their concentrations recorded inaccurately on
websites or labels. Herbal products may also include illegal
ingredients, such as ephedra, Asarum europaeum (European wild
ginger) and endangered animal species (eg, snow leopard). An
additional problem is augmentation with prescription
medications to enhance the apparent effectiveness of a
preparation. Toxic substances may also be deliberately or
inadvertently added: less expensive, more harmful plants may
be substituted for more expensive ingredients, and processing
may not be adequate. The lack of regulation and monitoring of
traditional herbal preparations in Australia and other Western
countries means that their contribution to illness and death is
unknown. We need to raise awareness of these problems with
health care practitioners and with the general public.

 specialist clinics also used complementary medicines.19 As many
as 65% of Australian people with cancer in 2010 used some form of
complementary medicine, more than half of whom did so in
combination with conventional therapy.20 A similar finding was
made in a study of 4500 Australians aged 50 years or more; 46.3% of
the participants used complementary medicines, of whom
87.4% used them alongside conventional therapy.21 The ten most
commonly used herbal preparations in Australia are aloe vera,
garlic, green tea, chamomile,
echinacea,
ginger, cranberry,
peppermint, ginseng, and Gingko biloba.22 Patterns of use differ
according to the medical problem being treated; for example,
St John’s wort is mainly used to treat depression.
Problems with herbal medicines
Adulteration with pharmaceutical agents
Twenty-four per cent of herbal preparations assessed in Taiwan in
1992e1993 included prescription medicines; this figure was quite
high, as such augmentation is illegal in Taiwan.23 Pharmaceutical
agents are still added to herbal preparations, as found in a recent
study of TCMs purchased in Australia.1 These substances are
presumably added to increase the apparent efficacy of the herbal
product, reinforcing its authority as a therapeutic alternative. A
patient with epilepsy suffered phenytoin poisoning after ingesting
a Chinese herbal preparation for seizures that had been augmented
with phenytoin, although this drug was not mentioned on the
label.24 Other pharmaceuticals that have been detected in osten-
sibly herbal products include antibiotics, antihistamines, cortico-
steroids, aminopyrine, aspirin, bromhexine, chlordiazepoxide,
diazepam,
diclofenac,
glibenclamide,
hydrochlorothiazide,
indomethacin, mefenamic acid, paracetamol, phenacetin, phenyl-
butazone, and theophylline.1,10,25,26 In addition to the potential risk
of ingesting uncontrolled amounts of these drugs, there are risks of
allergies to undisclosed ingredients (such as antibiotics) and of
interactions with prescribed medications. There have been reports
of Cushing syndrome associated with exposure to undisclosed
steroids, aplastic anaemia with exposure to phenylbutazone, and
hypoglycaemia with ingestion of glyburide.27,28
Substituted plant species
Replacement of one botanical species with another may be delib-
erate if the original plant is difficult to obtain or expensive.28 One of
the better known examples of this practice involved replacement of
Stephania tetrandra by Aristolochia fangchi in a weight loss prepa-
ration in Belgium; the substituted plant contained the nephrotoxin
aristolochic acid, which caused progressive interstitial nephritis,
resulting in renal failure in some patients.13
Herbal substitution may also be inadvertent if there has been
misinterpretation or inaccurate transcribing of the names or
formulae in texts. Vernacular names for herbs may differ from
region to region, different preparations may have the same name,
or one herb may have several names.29 All of this can lead to
preparation errors; for example, Podophyllum emodi has been used
instead of Gentiana species, resulting in serious podophyllin
poisoning leading to liver, gut and kidney disease and permanent
neurological damage;10 Chinese silk vine (Periploca sepium) taken
by a mother instead of Siberian ginseng (Eleutherococcus senticosus)
caused androgenisation in an infant.30
Presence of toxic substances
Toxic materials from animals or plants may be deliberately added
to herbal preparations or can be natural components of the plant
species used; for example, aconite root (used in TCM) is poisonous,
but can be blended with other herbs to neutralise its toxic effect.10
As shown by a case reported in this journal4 and another in South
Australia that had a lethal outcome despite liver transplantation,31
herbal preparations can be hepatotoxic, with significant adverse
effects ranging from marked elevation of liver enzyme activity to
fatal hepatic failure. These effects may be due to direct liver cell
damage caused by plant toxins, or to interactions with prescription
medications.14 Box 1 lists a selection of conditions and effects
associated with certain herbal remedies.
Infants are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of herbal
poisoning because of their immature liver detoxification pathways
and lower body weight. Chuenlin (Coptis chinensis), given to
neonates to “remove toxic products of pregnancy”, may cause
kernicterus that results in brain damage, as the alkaloid berberine
displaces bilirubin from plasma proteins, elevating its free levels in
serum.10
A toxic animal material knowingly added to traditional medicines
is the poisonous secretion of Asian toads (Duttaphrynus melanos-
tictus Schneider and Bufo gargarizans Gantor).34 Chan su, used to
treat a variety of conditions ranging from skin and throat infections
to palpitations, contains toad venom; its active components are
bufadienolides that have a digoxin-like effect on the heart, leading
to arrhythmias, seizures and coma.26 Various herbal preparations
are reported to have caused myocardial infarction, congestive
cardiac failure, hypotension, hypertension, arteritis, pericarditis,
movement disorders, muscle weakness, stroke, and seizures.35,36
Heavy metals, including arsenic, lead, mercury, copper, iron,
thallium, cadmium, manganese, nickel, and zinc can be essential
components of certain traditional medicines. A study of 251 Asian
herbal products in California found arsenic in 36 (14%), mercury in
35 (14%), and lead in 24 (10%).37 A study of TCM products
in Australia found excessive levels of lead, cadmium and arsenic in
61% of preparations.1 The levels can be high enough to cause acute
mercury and lead poisoning, the latter leading to encephalopa-
thy.10 A 5-year-old boy suffered arsenic poisoning when his
parents treated a malignancy with a traditional Indian remedy,38
while another young boy treated with “Tibetan herbal vitamins”
consumed about 63 g of lead over 4 years.39 Preparations can be
accidentally contaminated by heavy metals if plants are cultivated
in polluted environments or stored in tainted containers.27
Traditional herbal preparations may also contain pesticides,
including organochlorine preparations and banned substances
such as DDT. Other contaminants associated with poor storage

 conditions include herbicides, microorganisms, mycotoxins, and
insects.27
Inadequate processing
Processing of herbs should ensure removal of unwanted compo-
nents that may elicit adverse reactions. For example, dried aconite
root must be soaked in water and boiled before it is safe to use.
Aconite in Chinese herbal preparations has caused poisoning that
can lead to lethal cardiac failure and arrhythmia.27
Pharmaceutical interactions
A major area of concern is the potential interaction of herbal
medicines with conventional drugs, both prescribed and over-
the-counter products. Herbal medicines may enhance or reduce
the effects of prescribed medications or elicit unpredictable
idiosyncratic effects. Serum drug levels may be increased if their
clearance is reduced or their absorption enhanced because of
pharmacokinetic interactions.27 A selection of potential pharma-
cological interactions of some herbal preparations with prescrip-
tion drugs is given in Box 2. This table is not exhaustive. For
example, the effects of any drug metabolised by cytochrome P450
3A4 can be affected by St John’s wort. While its negative impact
on the effectiveness of warfarin is a particular problem, the effect
of clopidogrel can be increased, as St John’s wort enhances the
formation of its active metabolites.46
The American Society of Anesthesiologists has suggested that
herbal medicines should not be taken for at least 2 weeks before
surgery because of possible herbedrug interactions.40 Garlic,
ginseng and gingko, for instance, all increase the risk of haemor-
rhage; ginseng also predisposes patients to hypoglycaemia. Echi-
nacea is associated with allergic reactions, and kava and valerian
may enhance the sedative effects of anaesthetic agents. Ephedra
may cause intra-operative haemodynamic instability by lowering
endogenous catecholamine levels, and has been associated with
ventricular arrhythmias when halothane is used as general
anaesthetic.47 Herbal preparations may also alter the results of
laboratory tests by interfering with immunoassays.42
Auditing, regulation and awareness
It is likely that the majority of adverse drug reactions and drug
interactions associated with alternative medicines are unre-
ported. As noted in several Australian studies, fewer than 50% of
patients discuss their use of herbal preparations with health
professionals,6-8 and these medicines are rarely recorded on
hospital admission forms. The true risks of adopting herbal
preparations as a treatment option therefore remain unclear. In
Australia, the sale of herbal medicines is profitable6,7 and their
use is advertised and strongly advocated in popular media, and
is not balanced by package warnings48 or awareness campaigns
about the risks and side effects. The examples we have discussed
in this article indicate that some herbal products should carry
clear warnings, and highlight the need for a more open debate
about claims regarding their efficacy and risks. Guidelines have
recently been developed that provide a framework for selecting
chemical markers for quality control.49
In Australia, all packaged herbal medicines must be placed on the
Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) before they are
marketed. Medicines are either registered (a product that has been
assessed for safety, quality and effectiveness: AUST-R) or listed
(lower risk products not evaluated for efficacy: AUST-L). Most
herbal medicines are listed products. Listing of products on the
ARTG is based on self-assessment, a system that relies on the
honesty of the manufacturer with regard to their composition.
Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) audits during 2013 and
2014 found that 6e7% of complementary medicines did not
comply with regulations regarding formulation, manufacturing or
quality.50 With more than one in 20 complementary medicines
failing essential composition quality control in Australia, it is clear
that more meaningful regulation of the sector is needed. The
regulation of complementary medicines was recently reviewed,
but the recommendations still retain significant elements of
self-assessment.51
Further, the presence of AUST-L numbers on herbal medicines can
be misleading, as for consumers it implies a higher level of quality
control than is accurate. It was recently found that AUST-L TCM
products were adulterated with pharmaceuticals and carried
inaccurate or misleading ingredient lists.1 This shows that, at least
for TCMs, the TGA needs to adopt new auditing approaches and to

 prosecute manufacturers who misrepresent the composition of
herbal products. Apart from questions of medicinal efficacy, it is
reasonable to expect that AUST-L medicines should be tested
before and after they are made commercially available, and that
products not fit for human consumption be removed from the
market. If the status quo is not changed, the public needs to be
made more aware that herbal preparations are not effectively
regulated and that their use entails a degree of risk.
A new auditing tool kit
As with food products, it is reasonable to expect that the list of
ingredients on the packaging of herbal products is accurate.
Auditing of commercial herbal remedies has often been limited to
morphologically identifying botanical constituents, which can be
almost impossible in heavily processed material.52 Obsolete
quality control methods are often applied, and many are based on
pharmacopoeia entries that have not been updated to reflect recent
advances in analytic technology. In many cases, quality control is
limited to measuring a single active component; this is inadequate,
as a single botanical component may contain several compounds
with different pharmacological actions. For example, assessment of
St John’s wort preparations is typically standardised according to
its hyperforin concentration, but this is just one of the hundreds of
small molecules that the plant contains.
Until recently, there was no way to comprehensively audit the
composition of a herbal product, and it is clear that no single tech-
nique can provide the breadth of information needed to fully profile
a herbal medicine. However, the recent development of DNA-based
approaches has enhanced the capacity to ascertain the ingredients of
herbal products, and recent research has discovered that substitu-
tion and use of non-declared ingredients are commonplace. The
integration of DNA auditing techniques with advanced toxicolog-
ical and heavy metal analyses can provide effective means for ho-
listically evaluating herbal medicines. By combining several cutting
edge technologies, a comprehensive analysis of the composition of
herbal medicines sold in Australia is achievable.
Another way to improve auditing is to broaden the understanding
of the biochemical effects of these medicines, allowing the predic-
tion of pathological outcomes. Numerous studies have suggested
that the “omics” suite of technologies (such as genomics,
proteomics and metabolomics) has a significant role to play in
investigating herbal preparations.1 In particular, metabolomics
(a form of advanced, comprehensive biochemical profiling) has the
potential to provide detailed information on the composition of
herbal products. Combined with in vitro approaches, this may
provide the basis for a high throughput screening program for
profiling large numbers of herbal products. The combination
of latest generation technologies could provide the evidence
needed to accurately assess the potential risks posed by herbal
preparations.
Conclusion
While there is no doubt that prescription medications are respon-
siblefor manyserious side effectsanddeathsin Australia everyyear,
this should not distract us from trying to determine the contribution
of herbal preparations to morbidity and mortality. Although herbal
products are claimed (especially on social media sites) to be
completelysafe,it isdifficult to understandwhy itis widely believed
that preparations with biological activity would not also have the
potential to cause medicinal side effects. Light touch regulation of
the industry means that dosages can be inconsistent, contents
inaccurately listed, and toxic and pharmaceutical contaminants and
adulterants may be present in herbal medicines.
Rather disturbingly, the answer to the question we asked at the
beginning of this discussion — what are the risks to the Australian
community from herbal products? — is that we simply do not
know. This is a far from satisfactory situation, and perhaps one to
which state and federal governments and regulatory bodies,
including the TGA, should respond with greater urgency. We
would certainly support more widespread testing of products and
policing of label and website inaccuracies, although this will
require financial support from an already stretched health budget.
It may be appropriate for the TGA to require manufacturers to have
samples independently tested before placing them on the market.
Legal action should be considered in cases of non-compliance with
applicable
regulations,
and
preparations
containing
illegal
substances should be banned. How many more adverse drug
reactions involving herbal products are needed before more
attention is given to this important public health problem?
