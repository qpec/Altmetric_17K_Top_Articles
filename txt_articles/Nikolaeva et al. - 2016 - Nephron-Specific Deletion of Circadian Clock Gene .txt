ABSTRACT
The circadian clock controls a wide variety of metabolic and homeostatic processes in a number of tissues,
including the kidney. However, the role of the renal circadian clocks remains largely unknown. To address this
question, we performed a combined functional, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analysis in mice with inducible
conditionalknockout(cKO)ofBMAL1,whichiscriticallyinvolvedinthecircadianclocksystem,inrenaltubularcells
(Bmal1lox/lox/Pax8-rtTA/LC1 mice). Induction of cKO in adult mice did not produce obvious abnormalities in renal
sodium, potassium, or water handling. Deep sequencing of the renal transcriptome revealed significant changes
intheexpressionof genes relatedto metabolicpathwaysandorganicaniontransport incKO micecomparedwith
control littermates. Furthermore, kidneys from cKO mice exhibited a significant decrease in the NAD+-to-NADH
ratio, which reflects the oxidative phosphorylation-to-glycolysis ratio and/or the status of mitochondrial function.

The circadian timing system is an essential physi-
ologic regulatory mechanism that provides cells,
tissues, organs, and finally, the whole organismwith
an important functional advantage of anticipation
of circadian changes in the environment that are
imposed by the Earth’s rotation. The circadian tim-
ing system is organized in a hierarchical manner, in
that the central oscillator located in the suprachias-
matic nucleus of hypothalamus coordinates subsid-
iary oscillators located in peripheral tissues. On the
molecular level, both the central and peripheral
oscillators share a common molecular clock
mechanism on the basis of cell–autonomous and

 self–sustained transcriptional/translational feedback
loops. This core clock mechanism controls circadian
expression of so–called output genes that, in turn, im-
pose cell–specific functional rhythms (reviewed in refs.
1 and 2).
Previous studies have shown that the circadian timing
system plays a major role in renal function. In mice, whole-
body inactivation of different elements of the molecular clock
leads to abnormal circadian patterns of urinary sodium and
potassium excretion, loss of the circadian rhythmicity of
plasma aldosterone levels, and significant changes in arterial
BP (reviewed in refs. 3–5). In humans, growing evidence
suggests a possible link between dysregulation of renal circa-
dian rhythms and development of hypertension and accelera-
ted progression of CKD. The importance of the circadian clock
system in the kidney has been recently shown on the molecular
level. Zuber et al.6 and Nikolaeva et al.7 have shown that hun-
dreds of transcripts in the microdissected distal convoluted
tubule/connecting tubule and the cortical collecting duct
exhibit significant circadian oscillations in their expression
levels and that the whole-body inactivation of circadian tran-
scriptional factor Clock leads to dramatic changes in the tran-
scriptomes of the distal convoluted tubule/connecting tubule
and the cortical collecting duct. Gumz and colleagues8–10 have
shown that the circadian clock protein PER1 exerts diverse
effects on the renal handling of sodium. Zhang et al.11 have
shown that, among 12 tested mouse tissues, the kidney ex-
hibits the second greatest number of circadian transcripts (the
greatest number was found in the liver). However, the role of
the renal circadian clocks in the generation of functional and
molecular rhythms in the kidney as well as the development of
kidney disease remains largely unknown. To our knowledge,
the only study that addressed this question is a recent paper by
Tokonami et al.,12 which showed that ablation of the circadian
clock in renin–secreting granular cells results in several
abnormalities, including increased GFR, decreased plasma al-
dosterone levels, and low BP. Here, we studied the role of
circadian clocks in the nephron by using conditional and
inducible inactivation of BMAL1 protein, an indispensable
element of the molecular clock (Bmal1lox/lox/Pax8-rtTA/LC1
mice).
The renal tubular cells are involved in a wide variety of
essential functions, including maintenance of homeostasis,
disposition of xenobiotics, and synthesis of molecules that are
released into the bloodstream (e.g., bicarbonate and arginine).
Because many of these processes exhibit circadian rhythmicity,
the aim of this study was to identify the molecular pathways/
mechanisms that are directly controlled in the nephron by the
tubular circadian clock. Using an approach combining func-
tional, metabolomics, and deep sequencing analyses, we show
that the tubular circadian clock is not a prerequisite for the
control of the GFR or the water, sodium, and potassium bal-
ance. However, we show that the tubular circadian clock is
deeply involved in the control of both intrarenal and systemic
metabolisms as well as drug disposition.
RESULTS
Validation of the Bmal1lox/lox/Pax8-rtTA/LC1
(Conditional Knockout) Knockout Model
The conditional inactivation of the Arntl gene encoding
BMAL1 was induced by 2-week treatment with doxycycline
(DOX; 2 mg/ml in drinking water) of 8-week-old Bmal1lox/lox/
Pax8-rtTA/LC1 mice (hereafter referred to as conditional
knockout [cKO] mice). In parallel, the same DOX treatment
was provided to their littermate controls (Bmal1lox/lox mice;
hereafter referred to as control mice). The quantitative PCR
(qPCR) analysis revealed that Bmal1 mRNA expression was
significantly reduced in the kidneys of cKO mice (2 months
after the end of DOX treatment) (Supplemental Figure 1).
Immunohistochemical staining for BMAL1 and CRE expres-
sion was performed on day 5 of the 2-week DOX treatment
period or 2 months after the end of DOX treatment. As shown
in Supplemental Figure 2, at day 5 of DOX treatment, the CRE
was ubiquitously expressed along the renal tubule but not in
glomeruli or blood vessels in cKO mice. The BMAL1 protein
was ubiquitously expressed in all kidney cells in control mice,
but in cKO mice, all tubular cells became negative for BMAL1
staining at day 5 of DOX treatment (Supplemental Figure 3).
The specific tubular inactivation of BMAL1 was maintained in
cKO mice 2 months after the end of DOX treatment (Supple-
mental Figure 3).
To assess the effect of BMAL1 deficiency on circadian
mechanisms per se, we performed qPCR analysis of expression
levels of several genes involved in the core clock (Cry1, Per2,
and Nr1d1) and Dbp, an output gene that is directly controlled
by the circadian clock. As shown in Supplemental Figure 1, the
BMAL1 deficiency results in a significant attenuation in cir-
cadian oscillations of mRNA expression of Cry1, Per2, Nr1d1,
and Dbp. The expression level of Bmal2, a paralog of Bmal1
that is thought to be able to rescue the BMAL1 deficiency in
some tissues,13 was increased in kidneys of cKO mice, but the
absolute levels of Bmal2 expression remained significantly
lower than those of other tested core clock components (Sup-
plemental Figure 1). Collectively, these results suggested that
the activity of the circadian clock in renal tubular cells is sig-
nificantly impaired.
PAX8 is a paired–box transcriptional factor crucial to the
organogenesis and development of the kidney, the thyroid
gland, and the Müllerian system. Traykova-Brauch et al.14
used a partial Pax8 promoter to target the expression of a
tetracycline-dependent transactivator to the renal tubular
cells. The tissue specificity of the promoter-driven expression
was assessed in the kidney, liver, heart, lung, brain, spleen,
thyroid, and colon. Among the tissues tested, the Pax8–driven
CRE expression was found all along the renal tubule and in a
subset of periportal hepatocytes. Hence, we tested the BMAL1
expression in the liver. As shown in Supplemental Figure 4,
indeed, some proportion of liver cells located in the vicinity of
large blood vessels appeared negative for BMAL staining in
DOX–treated cKO mice.

 Basic Characteristics of cKO Mice
To avoid the potential side effects related to DOX toxicity, all
additional analyses were performed 2 months after the end of
DOX treatment. For all experiments, mice were adapted to a
12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle for 2 weeks.
The cKO mice were overtly normal; their body weight was
not different from the control mice, but their kidney weight-to-
body weight ratio was significantly decreased (Table 1). The
basic morphologic analysis did not reveal any obvious renal
abnormalities in cKO mice (tested parameters: gross renal
morphology, interstitial fibrosis, glomerular sclerosis, inflam-
mation, and vascular lesions; data not shown).
Blood collection was performed at Zeit-
geber time 4 (ZT4) and ZT16 (ZT0 is the
time of lights on, and ZT12 is the time of
lights off); 24-hour or hourly urine was
collected from freely moving mice housed
in metabolic cages with free access to food
and water. As shown in Table 1, the only
difference found in 24-hour urine samples
was a significant reduction in urinary pH in
cKO mice. Because the whole-body knock-
out of Clock results in significantly different
circadian kinetics of urinary water, sodium,
and potassium excretion, we also analyzed
the hourly urine excretion pattern in con-
trol and cKO mice. To exclude the influence
of light on urine excretory rhythms, the
hourly urine collection was also performed
on animals placed in constant darkness
30 hours before urine collection (dark/
dark conditions). As shown in Supplemen-
tal Figures 5 and 6, the circadian patterns of
urinary excretion of water, sodium, and
potassium were not different between con-
trol and cKO mice in both light/dark and
dark/dark conditions, respectively. Basic
analysis of plasma samples revealed signif-
icant increases in creatinine (ZT4 and
ZT16), urea (ZT4 and ZT16), and magne-
sium (ZT16) levels as well as osmolality
(ZT16) in cKO mice (Table 1) (t test). Dif-
ferences between ZT4 and ZT16 for plasma
parameters were analyzed by two-way
ANOVA. As shown is Supplemental Table
1, ANOVA revealed a significant effect of
time on plasma osmolality and plasma
concentration of sodium, potassium, cal-
cium, creatinine, urea, and aldosterone.
This effect of time was similar between
control and cKO mice. Importantly, there
was no difference in the GFR between con-
trol and cKO mice as measured by inulin
clearance (Table 1). The cKO mice
showed a modest but statistically significant
decrease in systolic BP (false discovery rate ,0.001) but not in
diastolic BP; the inactive–phase BP dipping was not different
between control and cKO mice (Supplemental Figure 7, Sup-
plemental Table 2). The 24-hour activity, heart rate, and pulse
pressure were not different between genotypes (data not
shown).

Plasma Metabolome Analysis of Control and cKO Mice
The increased plasma creatinine and urea levels along with
normal GFR suggested a tubular impairment in cKO mice.

 of physiologic processes, we performed unbiased kidney
transcriptome and plasma metabolome analyses in control
and cKO mice to identify metabolic/homeostatic pathways
and/or transporter systems that are controlled by the renal
circadian clock. Transcriptome profiling of RNAs extracted
from the whole kidney (ZT4 and ZT16) was performed by
deep sequencing, and the partial metabolome profiling (180
plasma metabolites from five substance classes; i.e., hexose,
amino acids, biogenic amines, acylcarnitines, and lipids;
BIOCRATES Life Sciences AG, Innsbruck, Austria) was per-
formed on plasma samples collected at ZT4 and ZT16.
For each sample, from 34 to 50 million sequencing reads
were aligned to the mouse genome (Supplemental Table 3). As
shown in Figure 1A, 721 and 765 transcripts exhibited differ-
ential expression levels between control and cKO mice at ZT4
and ZT16, respectively (false discovery rate ,0.05) (Supple-
mental Table 4). Among them, 552 transcripts were com-
monly changed at ZT4 and ZT16 (Figure 1A, Supplemental
Table 4). Gene ontology analysis with these 552 genes followed
by summarization in REVIGO15 revealed enrichment of
processes related to cellular metabolism (carboxylic acid
metabolism cluster shown in the blue box in Figure 1B, Sup-
plemental Table 5) and organic anion transport (organic
anion transport cluster shown in the pink box in Figure
1B, Supplemental Table 6). Differential expression of six
selected genes, namely nicotinamide phosphoribosyltrans-
ferase, peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-d,
mitochondrially encoded reduced nicotinamide adenine di-
nucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase 1, carnitine transporter
Slc22a5, monocarboxylate transporter 1 (or Slc16a1), and
cyclin–dependent kinase inhibitor 1a (or p21), was validated
by qPCR (Supplemental Figure 8). Analysis of transcripts
encoding proteins located in mitochondria showed that
transcripts encoded by both mitochondrial and nuclear ge-
nomes are significantly over-represented among the most
downregulated genes in cKO mice at both ZT4 and ZT16
(P,0.001; two–tailed Mann–Whitney U test) (Supplemen-
tal Figure 9). Because the circadian clock has been shown to
control mitochondrial biogenesis,16 we performed a quan-
titative analysis of mitochondrial genomic DNA in kidneys
of control and cKO mice. As shown in Figure 2A, the mito-
chondrial DNA content was not different between control
and cKO mice. The NAD+-to-NADH ratio, a marker reflect-
ing the oxidative phosphorylation-to-glycolysis ratio, was
significantly decreased in the kidney of cKO mice but not
in the liver (Figure 2B).
Metabolome analysis revealed significant differences in the
plasma levels of amino acids (arginine [ZT16], glutamate
[ZT4], and methionine [ZT 16]), biogenic amines (asymmet-
ric dimethylarginine [ZT16] and creatinine [ZT4 and ZT16];
thereby confirming results of blood chemistry analysis) (Table
1), carnosine (ZT16), taurine (ZT16), carnitine (ZT4 and
ZT16), and several acylcarnitines of different species of phos-
phatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylcholine, and sphingomye-
line (Supplemental Table 6).
Comparison of metabolome and transcriptome data al-
lowed us to identify several potential mechanisms through
which tubular circadian clocks participate in the control of
blood metabolome. Mechanisms involved in the control of
plasma urea/arginine and creatinine levels were selected for
validation and more in–depth analysis.

 the activity of Arginase I in the liver. Hence, it is generally
accepted that, in the normal physiologic state, Arginase II
(ARGII) does not influence plasma urea levels.17 Most of the
circulating L-arginine is synthesized in the kidney proximal
tubule from L-citrulline that is absorbed from the small in-
testine.
Analysis of transcriptomes revealed that ARGII transcript
levels are significantly upregulated in kidneys of cKO mice
(Supplemental Figure 10A, Supplemental Table 5). Western
blotting performed on microdissected renal tubules (Figure
3A, Supplemental Figure 10B) and immunohistochemical
staining (Supplemental Figure 10C) showed that ARGII pro-
tein expression is dramatically increased specifically in the
proximal straight tubule. As shown in Figure 3B, the enzymatic
arginase activity was significantly increased in kidneys of cKO
mice and reached approximately 25% of arginase activity in the
liver; the liver arginase activity was not different between con-
trol and cKO mice. In parallel, arginine levels in kidney tissue of
cKO mice were significantly increased (Figure 3C), thereby
providing a potential link with hyperargininemia in the cKO
mice shown in the metabolomic profiling (Supplemental Table
6). Interestingly, the activity of the nitric oxide synthase, the
second major arginine–consuming enzyme in the kidney,18 was
also significantly increased in cKO mice (Figure 3D).
Creatinine and Furosemide
Creatinine, a weak organic acid, is eliminated in the urine by
glomerular filtration and in part, tubular secretion. Vallon
et al.19 have shown that organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3
[Slc22a8]) significantly contributes to the creatinine secretion
in the mouse kidney. Analysis of transcriptome revealed that
OAT3 expression is reduced in cKO mice at both ZT4 and
ZT16 (Supplemental Table 4). These results were confirmed
by qPCR (Figure 4A). Western blotting showed an approxi-
mately 80% reduction in OAT3 protein expression in cKO
mice (Figure 4B) (P=0.004). Because OAT3 is involved in
the basolateral transport of a variety of organic acids, includ-
ing several clinically important drugs, we tested the possibility
that the tubular circadian clocks control pharmacologic prop-
erties of furosemide, a diuretic that is actively secreted in the
kidney by OAT3. As shown in Figure 4C, the cKO mice
exhibited rightward shift in the natriuretic dose-response
curve for furosemide (control mice: half maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50)=0.11760.048 mg furosemide per 1 g
body wt; cKO mice: half maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50)=0.26360.094 mg furosemide per 1 g body wt;
mean6SD; n=5; P=0.01; t test). In parallel, cKO mice showed
lower urinary furosemide excretion after a single 0.3-mg/g
body wt furosemide bolus (Figure 4D).

 DISCUSSION
An intriguing result of this study is that the renal phenotype of
cKO mice differs significantly from that of Clock null mice.7
The major differences are in the normal circadian dynamics of
urinary water, sodium, and potassium excretion, the normal
plasma aldosterone levels, and the normal GFR in cKO mice,
whereas these functions were significantly impaired in Clock
null mice. This difference suggests that either the tubular cir-
cadian clocks are not involved in the generation of urinary
excretory rhythms or the inactivation of tubular circadian
clocks could be fully compensated for by other mechanisms.
These findings raise the question about the tissue/cellular or-
igin of renal excretory rhythms. Okamura and colleagues20
showed that mice lacking Cry1 and Cry2 exhibit hyperaldoster-
onism and blunted circadian oscillations in plasma aldosterone
levels caused by increased aldosterone synthesis in adrenal
glands. We have recently shown that the deletion of Arntl in renal
granular cells results in modified circadian rhythm of urinary
sodium excretion, polyuria, increased GFR, and low BP.12 Ac-
cumulating evidence from the work by Titze et al.21 suggests
that total body sodium content fluctuates independently of in-
take or body weight, thereby pointing to a possible role of
extracellular sodium storage/release dynamics. Also, there is
strong evidence that the circadian rhythms of urinary potassium
excretion are determined, at least in part, by the net potassium
fluxes between intracellular and extracellular compartments.22
Collectively, these results suggest that circadian clocks in many
different organs/cell types may participate in the generation/
maintenanceofcircadianrhythms ofurinary sodium,potassium,
and water excretion, but the role of the intrinsic renal tubular
clocks in these processes remains unclear.
However, we found that the tubular circadian clock is
deeply involved in several other essential physiologic func-
tions, including control of both the intrarenal and systemic
metabolisms, elimination of xenobiotics/drugs, and mainte-
nance ofhomeostasisofcompoundssecreted into the blood by
the kidney (nota bene, it remains possible that some of the
observed changes result from circadian clock–independent
activity of BMAL1). The critical role of the circadian clock
system in the control of metabolism has been shown in a
number of tissues23; however, the novelty of our study is
that the suppression of the tubular circadian clock greatly
affects the plasma metabolome in a way that, in turn, may
affect metabolic and homeostatic processes at the systemic
level. Our partial metabolome analysis covered ,5% of the
total plasma metabolome estimates (180 versus approxi-
mately 4000 metabolites, respectively), but even this re-
stricted approach allowed us to identify .50 metabolites
that are differentially represented in plasma of cKO mice.
Comparison of transcriptome and metabolome data allows
us to establish tubular mechanisms that are disturbed in cKO
mice. For instance, carnitine deficiency in cKO mice correlates
with significantly decreased expression of the Scl22a5 carni-
tine transporter involved in the carnitine reabsorption in the
proximal tubule. Of note, the loss of function of Slc22a5 is a
well known cause of primary carnitine deficiency.24 Two of
these mechanisms, namely those that are involved in the renal
control of plasma creatinine and urea levels, were selected for
in-depth analysis. These two mechanisms were chosen,
because (1) plasma creatinine and urea concentrations are
commonly used as surrogate biomarkers of glomerular
(dys)function in clinical settings and (2) creatinine secretion
in the kidney occurs through the same transporter systems as
those used by many clinically important drugs (see below).
We found that the increase in plasma urea levels correlates
with tubular dysfunction and does not correlate with glomer-
ular dysfunction. We show that cKO mice exhibit a parallel
increase in the renal ARGII activity and renal and plasma
arginine levels. Arginine, a semiessential amino acid, is
synthesizedinthe proximal convolutedtubule and releasedinto
the bloodstream, where it can be, in part, recovered by the
proximal straight tubule and converted to urea and L-ornithine

 by ARGII or oxidized to nitric oxide and L-citrulline by nitric
oxide synthases in tubular and nontubular renal cells.18 Inter-
estingly, the activity of the nitric oxide synthase was also sig-
nificantly upregulated in kidneys of cKO mice. Collectively,
these results suggest that the circadian clock in tubular cells
controls both the intrarenal arginine metabolism and systemic
arginine and urea levels.
Similarly, we found that the increase in plasma creatinine
levels has tubular origin and results from the decreased
expression levels of OAT3. This finding has a second important
facet that supports the link between the circadian clock and the
pharmacokineticsofdrugs.TheOAT3transporterisinvolvedin
tubular secretion of a variety of clinically important drugs,
including diuretics (furosemide and bendroflumethiazide),
antiherpetics (acyclovir), antiretrovirals (tenofovir), antineo-
plastics (methotrexate), antibiotics (benzylpenicillin), and
many others (reviewed in ref. 25). Here, we show that the re-
duced expression of OAT3 in cKO mice correlates with a less
potent natriuretic effect and a lower rate of urinary elimina-
tion of furosemide, a diuretic that is not filtered in glomer-
uli and must be secreted into tubular lumen to inhibit the
sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter 2. To our knowl-
edge, this is the first demonstration that the renal circadian
clocks are involved in drug pharmacokinetic. Hence, together
with the well documented effects of the circadian clock on
drug metabolism in the liver,26 drug absorption in the intes-
tine,27 and drug distribution,28 our study shows that the cir-
cadian timing system interferes with drug pharmacokinetics
at very different levels and highlights the attention that must
be given to chronopharmacology and chronotherapy.
CONCISE METHODS
Animals
The procedures used to generate the characterization of Bmal1lox/lox,
Pax8-rtTA, and LC-1 Cre mice were described previously.14 The
three mouse lines used in this study are inbred strains bred on the
genetic background of the C57BL/6J mouse. The animals were
maintained ad libitum on the standard laboratory chow diet (KLIBA
NAFAG Diet 3800). Before all experiments, mice were adapted to a
12-hour light/dark cycle. All experiments with animals were per-
formed in accordance with the Swiss Guidelines for Animal Care,
which conform to the National Institutes of Health Animal Care
Guidelines.
Antibodies
Anti–CRE recombinase antibody was from Novagen. Anti-BMAL1
antibody was described elsewhere.12 Anti-ARGII antibody was from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antiactin antibody was
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Anti-OAT3 (SLC22a8) anti-
body was from Abcam, Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Anti-OCTN2
(SLC22a5) antibody was from GeneTex (Irvine, CA). Immunohisto-
chemistry and Western blotting protocols were identical to those de-
scribed previously.12
Metabolic Cages
Mice were housed in individual metabolic cages (Tecniplast). Urine
collection was performed after a 3-day adaptation period. Urine and
blood chemistry was analyzed as previously described.7 Hourly urine
collection was performed as previously described.7
Blood and Urine Chemistry
Partial plasma metabolome profiling (180 plasma metabolites from
five substance classes; i.e., hexose, amino acids, biogenic amines, acylcar-
nitines, and lipids) was performed by BIOCRATES Life Sciences AG.

mined by the PicoProbe Colometric Kit from BioVision, Inc. (San
Francisco, CA). Kidney tissue spermine levels were determined
by Ansynth Service B.V. Kidney tissue L-arginine levels were deter-
mined by a kit from MyBioSource. Arginase activity in the kidney and
liver tissues was determined as arginase–specific urea formation
from 14C-L-arginine as previously described.29,30 NOS activity was
determined as nitric oxide synthase–specific L-citrulline formation
from 14C-L-arginine as described in Supplemental Material.
