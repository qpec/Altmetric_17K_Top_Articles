OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of medical illness detected by laboratory screening 
in children entering foster care in a single, urban county.
METHODS: All children entering foster care in a single county in Ohio were seen at a 
consultation foster care clinic and had laboratory screening, including testing for infectious 
diseases such as HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, and tuberculosis as well as for 
hemoglobin and lead levels.
RESULTS: Over a 3-year period (2012–2015), laboratory screening was performed on 1977 
subjects entering foster care in a consultative foster care clinic. The prevalence of hepatitis 
B, hepatitis C, syphilis, and tuberculosis were all found to be <1%. There were no cases 
of HIV. Seven percent of teenagers entering foster care tested positive for Chlamydia. A 
secondary finding was that 54% of subjects were hepatitis B surface antibody–negative, 
indicating an absence of detected immunity to the hepatitis B virus.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine laboratory screening for children entering foster care resulted in a 
low yield. Targeted, rather than routine, laboratory screening may be a more clinically 
meaningful approach for children entering foster care.

 US child welfare agencies hold legal 
custody of ∼430 000 children.1 
Children in foster care have 
more medical, behavioral, and 
developmental problems than 
the general population.2 
–5 This 
is compounded by incomplete 
medical records and uncoordinated, 
discontinuous medical care.6, 
 
7
To address medical concerns, 
most states mandate a medical 
examination when children enter 
foster care.8, 
 
9 Standards for this 
medical examination are unclear, 
but published guidance is available. 
One important resource is the 
American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP) Healthy Foster Care America, 
created to “improve the health and 
well-being outcomes of children and 
teens in foster care.” 
10 This 2005 
initiative was a sentinel effort to 
identify the medical needs of this 
high-risk population and provide 
guidance to assist the health care 
professionals who care for these 
children in the absence of other 
evidence-based practices. Disease 
screening by laboratory testing was 
included because a positive test 
result, although generally rare, can 
trigger interventions, leading to 
substantial improvements in health 
and wellbeing.11 Healthy Foster Care 
America recommended routine12 
screening for the hepatitis B virus 
(HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), 
tuberculosis (TB) (>3 months of 
age), and syphilis. HIV screening was 
recommended for at-risk children. 
Hemoglobin concentrations were 
recommended for all children, and 
lead levels were recommended for 
children between 6 months and 
6 years old.13 Because research 
in this population is limited, 
recommendations were derived 
from expert opinion14 and research 
in high-risk adult populations (eg, 
incarcerated and substance-abusing 
adults15, 
 
16). For sexually active 
adolescents, sexually transmitted 
infection screening guidelines 
from the AAP17 and the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC)18 are also applicable. Even 
with Healthy Foster Care America 
recommendations and other AAP 
policies, there is a lack of clarity 
around the utility of laboratory 
screenings for children entering 
foster care. In the context of high-
value, cost-conscious care,

evaluating practice is important 
and necessary. The objectives 
of this study were to determine 
the prevalence of medical illness 
detected by routine laboratory 
screening in a pediatric population 
entering foster care and to evaluate 
the clinical utility and financial costs 
of laboratory screening.
MEthODS
This retrospective study of electronic 
health record (EHR) data from 
2012 to 2015 was approved by the 
hospital’s institutional review board. 
Subjects were included if they were 
<21 years old, in the legal custody of 
the local county child welfare agency, 
and seen at the Foster Care Clinic 
(FCC).
The FCC uses a consultation model22 
designed with the local Ohio child 
welfare agency to evaluate every 
child entering foster care in 1 county. 
Children are seen within 5 days of 
entering foster care and again 1 to 
2 months later. The process repeats 
with every placement change. The 
first FCC visit includes record review, 
history taking, physical examination, 
and laboratory screening to test for 
HBV, HCV, and syphilis in all children 
and TB in children >3 months of age. 
Because there is no consensus on 
HIV risk-assessment tools, and foster 
care status could be considered high 
risk, all patients receive HIV testing. 
Hemoglobin concentrations and lead 
levels (in subjects 6 months to 6 
years old) are obtained. Laboratory 
tests available in the EHR and 
completed within a year of placement 
in foster care were reviewed and not 
repeated unless clinically indicated. 
Laboratory tests that were not 
obtained at the first FCC visit (ie, 
unable to obtain blood, purified 
protein derivative [PPD] not read, 
etc) were obtained at a subsequent 
visit.
Gonorrhea and Chlamydia screening 
was obtained in sexually active youth 
12 years and older on the basis of 
screening guidelines from the AAP17 
and the CDC18 for sexually active girls 
and high-risk sexually active boys. All 
sexually active boys were screened 
because adolescents in foster care are 
considered high risk.23 Guidelines for 
pregnancy screening in foster care 
were unavailable; pregnancy tests 
were obtained in sexually active girls 
to facilitate distributing hormonal 
contraception.24
Laboratory Screening Methods
 
Table 1 provides laboratory 
screening methodology.18, 
 
25, 
 
26 
Screening is obtained regardless 
of immunization status. Any child 
found to have negative results for 
hepatitis B surface antigen, core 
antibody, and surface antibody 
testing was considered nonimmune 
to HBV even with documented 
vaccination (Table 1). For these 
youth, a reimmunization plan was 
initiated. For elevated lead levels, 2 
cutoffs were included: a cutoff of 0.84 
μg/dL, which is the mean blood lead 
level from the NHANES 2013–2014, 
and 3.5 μg/dL, which is the 97.5% 
level.27, 
 
28 Hemoglobin concentrations 
were evaluated on the basis of age 
norms and according to the hospital 
laboratory reference ranges.29 
Information on the treatment of 
anemia and elevated lead levels in 
this sample is unavailable.
Data Collection
Demographic and order data from 
FCC patient visits were extracted 
from the EHR with electronic order 
entry. If subjects were seen at the 
FCC more than once, data from 
the first encounter were used.

 registration during the first patient 
encounter with the hospital, typically 
before FCC visits. Demographic data 
not in the EHR were collected from 
foster youth or the accompanying 
adult at the FCC visit. Laboratory data 
reviewed or ordered at the initial FCC 
encounter were included. No data 
were collected from child welfare 
records.
Billing data were collected from the 
EHR and codified by using current 
procedural terminology codes. All 
children were insured through 
Medicaid; Ohio 2016 Medicaid 
reimbursement rates were used to 
calculate payment per test. This does 
not reflect the true cost associated 
with performing the test, nor does it 
include professional fees associated 
with the tests.
Data Analysis
Subjects were dichotomized into 2 
groups, <12 and ≥12 years of age, 
because of increased risks of sexually 
transmitted infections in adolescents.
Because vertical transmission 
of maternal HCV antibodies is 
common and does not necessarily 
indicate disease, 
30 subjects were 
dichotomized into groups of <18 and 
≥18 months of age for HCV testing. 
Subjects who tested positive for HCV 
antibodies before 18 months of age 
had laboratories repeated after 18 
months of age, when maternal HCV 
antibodies are expected to clear31 
(Fig 1).
Descriptive statistics were calculated 
to understand rates of testing 
stratified by age. Test frequencies 
and positive test results were used 
to calculate the percent of positive 
and false-positive laboratory results. 
Relevant laboratory result ranges 
were also reported.
RESULtS
The study county includes 804 520 
people: 68% white and 26% African 
American, and 26% of children 
live in poverty. On January 1, 2014, 
1434 children were in child welfare 
custody.32 During the study period,

Laboratory Screening Methods
Laboratory
Method
Notes
Hepatitis B 
screening
CMIA testing for hepatitis B surface antigen, 
surface antibody, and core antibody
Current hepatitis B infection was diagnosed when the hepatitis B surface antigen and 
core antibody were positive. Past, recovered hepatitis B infection was diagnosed 
when the hepatitis B core antibody and surface antibody were positive. If only the 
HepBSAb was positive, this was considered a demonstration of immunity from 
hepatitis B immunization. If all test results were negative, then the child was 
considered susceptible and nonimmune, and an immunization plan was made.
Hepatitis C 
screening
Hepatitis C antibody test, a CMIA for the detection 
of antibody to HCV
A positive-antibody test result reflexed to a hepatitis C RNA quantitative PCR test for 
confirmation.
Syphilis 
screening
RPR, a qualitative test for nontreponemal 
antibodies using carbon particle cardiolipin 
antigen methodology, or syphilis EIA, an ELISA 
methodology to detect IgM and IgG antibodies 
against Treponema pallidum
All positive-EIA test results had reflex RPR tests, and all positive-EIA and RPR test results 
had a confirmatory test done by particle agglutination test with specific qualitative 
detection of antitreponemal antibodies (TP-PA).
In August 2014, our laboratory changed the standard screen from the RPR to EIA 
because of a syphilis epidemic in our county, following CDC recommendations.19
HIV screening
Fourth-generation HIV antigen and/or antibody 
screen, uses CMIA methodology designed to 
detect p24 antigen and antibodies to HIV type 1 
(group M and group O) and type 2
Positive test results reflexed to the HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody differentiation 
immunoassay. If the antibody differentiation testing result was negative or 
indeterminate, quantitative PCR testing was added. This multitest algorithm is 
consistent with CDC recommendations.21
TB screening
For children <5 years old, PPD TST performed by 
injecting 0.1 mL of tuberculin PPD intradermally 
into the inner surface of the forearm. For 
children older than 5 years, the Quantiferon-TB 
Gold test, a cell culture and semiquantitative 
ELISA methodology, to detect interferon γ 
release
The TST was read 48 h to 72 h after administration by measuring millimeters of 
induration. Children receiving a TST were considered medium risk because of age 
and exposure to adults in high-risk categories, therefore, induration of 10 mm or 
more was considered positive.22 Quantiferon-TB Gold testing provides a qualitative 
result (negative, positive, or indeterminate) based on interpretation of measured 
interferon γ release from the venous blood samples. Indeterminate results were 
repeated.
Gonorrhea and 
Chlamydia
Urine DNA studies, methodology was a 
transcription mediated amplification to detect 
the presence of nucleic acid of Chlamydia 
trachomatis and/or Nesisseria gonorrheae
Confirmation testing was not reflexively performed but was independently ordered and 
performed for children with concern for sexual abuse.
Pregnancy test
Qualitative chromogenic urine test for human 
chorionic gonadotropin
Not applicable.
Lead testing
Venous samples using electrochemistry with gold 
sensor
Reflex to graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy for levels >4.9 μg/dL.
Hemoglobin
Complete blood count, determined by flow 
cytometry, fluorescence, and absorption 
spectrophotometry
Chosen over a finger stick because venipuncture was already performed for the other 
tests.

 1977 unique subjects completed an 
evaluation at the FCC. Subject ages 
ranged from 0 to 21 years  
(Meanage = 8.7), and 1317 (66.9%) 
were <12 years old. The population 
was 54% boys, and the racial and/or 
ethnic distribution was 51% African 
American, 35% white, 2.7% Hispanic, 
and 14% other or unknown. With the 
exception of race and/or ethnicity, 
clinic demographics reflect national 
child welfare demographics (Meanage =  
8.7 years, 52% boys, 24% African 
American, 42% white, 22% Hispanic, 
and 14% other or unknown).1
During the study period, 16 754 
laboratory screening tests were 
performed, and 1193 children (60%) 
had at least 1 laboratory abnormality 
(Table 2). The most common was a 
negative result for hepatitis B surface 
antibody (HepBSAb) testing, which 
indicates an absence of detected 
immunity to HBV (see Table 1 for an 
interpretation).
Children <12 years Old
Among children <12 years of age, 
690 (52%) had at least 1 laboratory 
abnormality. The most common was 
a negative result for HepBSAb testing 
(570 of 1284 subjects, 44%).
HCV was the most common positive 
laboratory result (30 [2.3%] of 1285 
individuals tested; Fig 1). Subjects 
with a positive-HCV antibody result 
had confirmatory polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) testing; no patients 
had true infection. The false-positive 
rate in these subjects was 100%.
Two of 514 subjects tested positive 
for TB (0.39%). Both subjects had a 
positive-Quantiferon test, a negative 
chest radiograph, were diagnosed 
with latent TB, and were treated.
No new infections of HIV, hepatitis 
B, or syphilis were diagnosed. Two 
false-positives for HIV (0.16% of the 
1283 tested) were identified by a 
positive-HIV antigen/antibody screen 
with a negative HIV-1 and HIV-2 
antibody differentiation immunoassay 
and negative quantitative PCR. Three 
of 1277 patients (0.23%) had false-
positives for HBV resulting from 
positive-hepatitis B surface antigen 
results shortly after receiving the 
HBV immunization. All were retested 
and had negative results. One of 1289 
tested patients (0.07%) was false-
positive for syphilis, with a positive-
enzyme immunoassay result and a 
negative treponema pallidum particle 
agglutination assay result.
Of 1206 subjects receiving hemoglobin 
testing, 51 (4.2%) were anemic. 
Hemoglobin values ranged from 9.1 to 
17.3 g/dL (Mean = 12.8 g/dL).
Blood lead levels ≥3.5 μg/dL 
(≥97.5%) were detected in 17 of 
640 patients tested (2.7%) between 
6 months and 6 years of age. The 
highest risk was in children ages 2

For hepatitis C, 40 youth (30 who were <12 y and 10 who were ≥12 y) initially screened positive and were tested to confirm 
infection. Of those, only 2 tested positive. For syphilis, 4 youth initially screened positive and were tested to confirm 
infection. Of those, 1 tested positive and was subsequently treated. For HIV, 2 youth initially screened positive and were 
tested to confirm infection. Of those, none tested positive. For TB, 8 youth initially tested positive with Quantiferon, and 
1 youth tested positive with PPD. All subsequently had chest radiographs to confirm diagnosis; none had TB by chest

 years to 3 years of age (3.2%), with 
levels up to 32.8 μg/dL (Table 3).
Children 12 years and Older
In subjects ≥12 years of age, 504 of 
660 (76%) had at least 1 laboratory 
abnormality. The most common was 
a negative HepBSAb test result (468 
of 645, 73%).
Chlamydia was identified in 37 
(6.6%) of 562 subjects tested. Four 
subjects had positive-gonorrhea test 
results (4 of 561, 0.71%). 
Ten subjects had positive-HCV antibody 
results (10 of 644, 1.6%). Two subjects 
had true infection confirmed by PCR 
(80% false-positive rate).
Three of 645 subjects tested for 
syphilis were positive (0.5%); 2 were 
false-positive. One true HBV infection 
was detected (hepatitis B surface 
antigen–positive, hepatitis B core 
antibody–positive, and HepBSAb–
negative) among 641 subjects tested 
(0.16%), with no false-positives.
Seven of 548 subjects tested positive 
for TB (1.3%); all were diagnosed 
with latent TB after a negative chest 
radiograph and treated.
There were no positive-HIV test 
results among 636 subjects tested.
Thirty-five of 592 subjects 
(5.9%) were identified as anemic. 
Hemoglobin ranged from 4.4 to 18.7 
g/dL, with an average of 14.2 g/dL.
Of the 142 girls receiving pregnancy 
tests, 6 (4.2%) were positive. One was 
previously aware of her pregnancy.
Payments associated with laboratory 
screenings are provided in Table 4. 
The 16 754 laboratory tests billed 
to Medicaid accounted for a total 
payment of $370 214; $349 122 
(94%) were associated with negative 
or normal findings.
DISCUSSION
The utility of routine laboratory 
screening for children entering 
foster care is unclear.13, 
 
14 This is 
the first study in which researchers 
describe results of routine laboratory 
screening in this population. Eighty-
six children (4.8% of those screened) 
were identified with anemia, 17 
children (2.6%) were identified 
with lead levels ≥3.5 μg/dL, and 57 
children (2.9%) were identified with 
infectious disease.
Reported anemia rates in foster care 
children <6 years old range between 
1.8%3 and 10%.33 This study’s 
anemia rates fall within those rates 
(4.2% for children <12 years old; 
5.9% for children ≥12 years old) 
and are higher than the national 
anemia rate.34, 
 
35 The Bright Futures 
Guidelines for Health Supervision of 
Infants, Children, and Adolescents 
recommend hemoglobin testing for 
all children at age 12 months and 
risk assessments at subsequent well-
child checks36; the CDC recommends 
screening female adolescents for 
anemia every 5 years and risk 
assessments yearly.35 Children in 
foster care are less likely to receive 
well-child care, 
7 thus, laboratory 
assessments for anemia at the 
time of entry into foster care seem 
appropriate for all children in foster 
care.
Elevated lead levels (≥3.5 μg/dL) 
have been identified in 2.7% of 
children 6 months to 6 years of age, 
similar to previously reported rates 
in a foster youth population (2.6%, 
cutoff not reported)3 but lower 
than the rates for the county of this 
study (6.3%, using a higher cutoff 
of 5 μg/dL).37 Children ages 2 years 
to 3 years had the highest rates of 
elevated lead levels (3.2%). Although 
the reasons for elevated lead levels 
in this sample are unknown and 
could be related to lead exposures 
in the study county, it is possible 
that residential instability in the 
population, both before and after 
entry into foster care, may result in 
increased opportunity for exposure. 
It is possible that lead levels for 
this study are actually higher than 
reported because of the use of the 
LeadCare machine, which read 
falsely low and was recalled.38 
Elevated lead levels, although 
typically asymptomatic, can lead to 
neurocognitive deficits, and no safe 
threshold is established.39 For this 
reason, Bright Futures recommends 
testing for all children at ages 12 
months and 24 months.36 Because 
children entering foster care are less 
likely to have received routine well-
child care, 
7 the rates of elevated lead 
levels found in this study emphasize 
the value of screening children 6 
months to 6 years of age at the time 
of entry into foster care.
The prevalence of infections except 
gonorrhea and Chlamydia (eg, HIV, 
HBV, HCV, syphilis, and TB) was 
<1%, with a Medicaid payment of 
>$200 000. This is despite the county 
of study having the highest sexually 
transmitted infection rate in the 
state, with 362 per 100 000 people 
diagnosed with HIV40 (US average 
is 353), 0.1 per 100 000 diagnosed 
annually with HCV (US average is 
0.3), 9.3 per 100 000 diagnosed 
annually with syphilis (US average is

 3.9), and 2.7 per 100 000 diagnosed 
annually with TB (US average 
is 4.6).41 As a result of routine 
screening, 46 children (2.3%) had 
false-positive results for infectious 
disease. This raises questions about 
the benefit of routine screening.
The CDC recommends routine 
HIV screening in settings where 
prevalence is >0.1%.42 This study’s 
prevalence rate was 0% (95% 
confidence interval = 0–0.006). 
CDC recommendations would deem 
routine HIV screening unnecessary 
unless additional HIV risk factors 
are present.42 Clinicians should use 
their best judgment for screening in 
their populations, in which rates may 
differ.
Researchers in a 1998 study in 
California found a <1% positive-TB 
PPD rate in children ages 12 and 
younger, and a 12% positive-PPD 
rate in children ages 13 years to 18 
years entering foster care.33 Our 
study’s latent TB rate was 1.1% and 
may reflect a lower percentage of 
Hispanic patients (2.7% compared 
with 18%) and decreased exposure 
to immigrants or travelers to Latin 
America.43
One patient (0.05% of those tested) 
tested positive for HBV. Fifty-four 
percent of children tested negative 
for HepBSAb. Negative-HepBSAb 
results may indicate susceptibility 
to HBV despite vaccination.44 
When susceptibility is established, 
reimmunization is recommended 
with a booster vaccination 
and retesting to demonstrate 
seroconversion.45 Children are 
not routinely screened for HBV 
susceptibility, 
46 and research 
suggests that HBV vaccination 
induces immunologic memory 
for HBV, resulting in ongoing 
protection even after the antibody 
declines.47 The laboratory screening 
in this study resulted in a 54% 
reimmunization rate, highlighting 
potential unnecessary immunizations 
after laboratory testing.
Chlamydia and gonorrhea testing is 
recommended by the AAP17 and the 
CDC18 for sexually active adolescent 
girls and high-risk sexually active 
adolescent boys. The rate of 6.6% for 
Chlamydia and 0.7% for gonorrhea 
among youth 12 years and older is 
higher than the general population.48 
The study county reports 313 per 
100 000 people diagnosed with 
gonorrhea (US average is 101) and 
796 per 100 000 people diagnosed 
with Chlamydia (US average is 426), 
41 
indicating increased prevalence 
in the community. Screening for 
sexually transmitted infections 
at the time of entry into foster 
care is particularly important 
because adolescents are not 
routinely receiving recommended 
annual sexually transmitted 
infection screening,

Routine screening is generally 
accepted when screening tools are 
sensitive and specific and early 
detection improves outcomes. 
Screening program costs must be 
reasonable in relation to anticipated 
benefits.11 Although we are unable 
to provide a cost-benefit analysis for 
each screening test, we were able to 
provide a cost-identification analysis 
using published Medicaid payment 
rates applied to the existing literature 
on screening and treatment costs 
of infectious diseases. Examples of 
higher-yield and lower-yield screens 
illustrate how clinicians can use this 
study’s results to inform their clinical 
decisions on screening. Screening 
581 foster youth for Chlamydia 
resulted in Medicaid payments 
summing $27 336; 39 positive cases 
were identified, resulting in $700 
for each positive case. Diagnosis and 
treatment of Chlamydia in an office 
visit is estimated to cost $109.52 
Untreated, Chlamydia can result in 
pelvic inflammatory disorder, ectopic 
pregnancy, and infertility. Pelvic 
inflammatory disorder treatment 
costs range from $701 if diagnosed 
and treated in the outpatient setting 
to $1382 if treated in the emergency 
department, 
53 suggesting that the 
cost associated with diagnosing and 
treating Chlamydia in this sample 
is less than the cost of failing to 
diagnose and treat infection. By 
comparison, the payment was $9730 
per case of latent TB identified in 
this sample, and latent TB treatment 
cost is estimated between $236 and 
$1841, 
54 resulting in a total estimate 
of $14 000 per case of latent TB or 
$126 000 for the 9 cases identified. 
Of individuals with untreated latent 
TB, ∼10% develop active TB.54 If the 
9 latent TB cases went untreated, 
we would anticipate 1 could develop 
active TB. The cost of treating 1 
active TB case ($13 24754) would 
still be less than the cost of routine 
screening. More targeted screening of 
TB could be fiscally appropriate.
This study of foster youth from 
1 county in Ohio may not be 
generalizable to other foster care 
populations. Rates of infectious 
disease are sufficiently low, so it is 
not a surprise that no cases were 
identified. Across socioeconomic 
indicators, this county is slightly 
more impoverished than the general 
US population.55 The county has 
the highest sexually transmitted 
infection rate in the state, and 
county level data suggest that most 
conditions (with the exception of 
TB) are overrepresented in this 
county compared with national 
averages.41 Findings should be 
cautiously applied to communities 
with differing infection prevalence. 
Further, this study included foster 
youth for whom the FCC received 
a referral from the child welfare 
agency. However, 11.4% of referrals 
were not seen in the clinic, primarily 
because of unsuccessful contact and 
failure to attend visits. Infection 
rates may be higher in those youth. 
These limitations may impact 
generalizability for the highest-risk 
foster youth. It is difficult to directly 
compare cost, charges, and payments; 
these data represent estimates  
only.
CONCLUSIONS
The yield of laboratory screening 
in this sample of youth entering 
foster care was low and costly. 
Targeted screening may be more 
beneficial for youth entering foster 
care. High-impact screening may 
include lead levels for children 
<6 years old, hemoglobin screens, 
sexually transmitted infection 
testing in children 12 years and 
older, and HBV testing if determining 
potential failure to seroconvert is 
needed. Targeted infection screening 
should take local prevalence rates 
and other clinical indications into 
account. Replicating this work with 
other foster care populations and 
developing an algorithm for targeted 
screening are important areas for 
future research.
