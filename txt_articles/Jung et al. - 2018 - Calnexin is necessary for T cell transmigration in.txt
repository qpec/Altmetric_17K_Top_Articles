Introduction
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a leading cause of disability in young adults and affects over 2.5 million people 
worldwide (1, 2). MS is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS mediated by autoreactive T 
cells (3). In MS and in its animal model (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; EAE), circulating 
immune cells access the CNS across the blood-brain barrier to cause inflammation, myelin destruction, 
and neuronal damage, all of which set the stage for the development of the clinical manifestations of 
this disabling/progressive disease. The pathology of MS includes the presence of multiple demyelinated 
plaques in the CNS, the presence of inflammatory immune cells in the brain, loss of oligodendrocytes, 
and axonal demyelination and degeneration.
Blood-brain barrier dysfunction is a hallmark of many CNS disorders, including MS (4, 5). It con-
sists of a complex multicellular structure composed of a highly specialized and tightly sealed monolayer 
of brain endothelial cells buttressed by pericytes in the basal membrane, perivascular macrophages, and 
astrocyte foot processes (4, 5). The blood-brain barrier restricts the transfer of molecules to the CNS paren-
chyma, but when disrupted — for example due to inflammation or stroke — neuronal functions can be 
compromised (6). Brain endothelial cells achieve their highly selective permeability through a junctional 
complex by using both tight junctions and adherens junctions. Tight junctions between endothelial cells are 
principally responsible for the barrier function. Under healthy conditions, CNS endothelial cells express 
low levels of leukocyte adhesion molecules, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) and inter-
cellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs; ICAM1 and -2) but are expressed highly in the vasculature during 
EAE and MS to promote T cell influx into the brain parenchyma (7). T cell/endothelial cell interactions are 
mediated by adhesion molecules and chemokines and their respective chemokine receptors (4). Tight junc-
tion proteins (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule [PECAM], junctional adhesion molecule [JAM], 
In multiple sclerosis (MS), a demyelinating inflammatory disease of the CNS, and its animal model 
(experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; EAE), circulating immune cells gain access to 
the CNS across the blood-brain barrier to cause inflammation, myelin destruction, and neuronal 
damage. Here, we discovered that calnexin, an ER chaperone, is highly abundant in human brain 
endothelial cells of MS patients. Conversely, mice lacking calnexin exhibited resistance to EAE 
induction, no evidence of immune cell infiltration into the CNS, and no induction of inflammation 
markers within the CNS. Furthermore, calnexin deficiency in mice did not alter the development 
or function of the immune system. Instead, the loss of calnexin led to a defect in brain endothelial 
cell function that resulted in reduced T cell trafficking across the blood-brain barrier. These findings 
identify calnexin in brain endothelial cells as a potentially novel target for developing strategies 
aimed at managing or preventing the pathogenic cascade that drives neuroinflammation and 
destruction of the myelin sheath in MS.

occludin, claudins, and cadherin) regulate paracellular flux and prevent molecules/cells from translocating 
across the blood-brain barrier (4–6, 8). Integrin activation leads to enhanced affinity of the adhesion mol-
ecule for its endothelial blood-brain barrier ligands including VCAM1, ICAM1, and P-selectins to support 
lymphocyte exit from the blood flow by extravasating through the vascular endothelial cell wall, a process 
of transendothelial migration (4–6).
The ER is an elaborate membrane system that houses a variety of cellular functions that are critical 
for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis; synthesis of membrane-associated, luminal, and secreted pro-
teins; correct folding and posttranslational modification of proteins and glycoproteins; lipid and steroid 
synthesis; and Ca2+ signaling and storage (9–11). To perform these diverse functions, the ER engages a 
wide assortment of multifunctional integral membrane and luminal chaperones, including calnexin, an ER 
integral membrane protein (12). This protein is involved in the folding and quality control of membrane-as-
sociated and secreted glycoproteins (10). Elimination of calnexin function has diverse effects in different 
organisms. Calnexin deficiency is lethal in Schizosaccharomyces pombe but not in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 
Dictyostelium (13), or Caenorhabditis elegans (14). Interestingly, the loss of calnexin affects phagocytosis in 
Dictyostelium (15) and endocytosis in mammalian cells (16). Calnexin is highly expressed during the devel-
opment of the nervous system (17, 18), and in mice, calnexin deficiency causes a peripheral axonal dysmy-
elinating phenotype involving reduced peripheral nerve conduction velocities (18–20).
What is the calnexin link between the immune system and the nervous system? To answer this ques-
tion, we examined the involvement of calnexin in the pathogenesis of MS. In this study, we discovered 
that calnexin is highly abundant in the brains of MS patients, while deficiency of calnexin in mice confers 
resistance to EAE. Although MS is regarded as a progressive autoimmune disease of the CNS, we did not 
find evidence indicating that calnexin deficiency in mice causes impaired development or function of the 
immune system. In contrast, we observed that the loss of calnexin caused a defect in CNS endothelial cell 
function that resulted in resistance of the blood-brain barrier to circulating T cell infiltrations. These find-
ings identify a link between calnexin expression in CNS endothelial cells and the pathogenic cascade that 
drives neuroinflammation and destruction of the myelin sheath seen in MS.
Results
Calnexin is upregulated in brain samples of  MS patients. Clinical symptoms of MS result from axonal and neu-
ronal dysfunction and injury in human brain tissue. MRI patient brain scans characteristically show white 
matter lesions on FLAIR and T2-weighted sequences (Figure 1A). Lesions often occur in the periventricu-
lar region and juxtacortical white matter, sites enriched with venules, where blood-brain barrier breakdown 
frequently occurs. We discovered a high abundance of calnexin immunoreactivity (Figure 1B, left column) 
and immune cell infiltration (Figure 1B, right column, Oil Red O–stained) in MS brain sections, including 
acute, subacute, and chronic demyelinating lesions, as well as normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). 
Calnexin abundance in acute and chronic lesions was greater compared with control, NAWM, and sub-
acute brain lesion tissue. Flow cytometric analysis also revealed high abundance of calnexin in MS brain 
endothelial cells (Figure 1C) indicating that calnexin was expressed in human CNS endothelial cells. This 
was further supported by immunostaining of human brain microvascular capillaries in control (non-MS) 
tissue versus acute and chronic demyelinating lesions (Figure 1C).
Calnexin-deficient mice are resistant to induction of  EAE. To test whether high abundance of calnexin is 
important to MS pathogenesis, we induced EAE in calnexin-deficient mice using myelin oligodendrocyte 
glycoprotein (MOG35–55) inoculation in complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA). Within the first 2 weeks of 
injection, the WT mice — as well as mice with only 1 functional calnexin allele (heterozygotes, Canx+/–) 
— developed typical neurobehavioral deficits associated with EAE induction (Figure 2A). Surprisingly, 
calnexin-deficient mice (Canx–/–) exhibited no signs of EAE throughout the disease course (23 days) (Figure 
2A). Consistent with these neurobehavioral features, histologic evaluation of the CNS tissue at 14 days 
after immunization revealed dramatic differences between calnexin-deficient animals and WT littermates 
(Figure 2B and Figure 3). In the EAE WT animals, there was significant infiltration of leukocytes into the 
white matter of the spinal cord (Figure 2B and Figure 3A). In contrast, spinal cords from calnexin-deficient 
mice immunized with the MOG35–55 peptide showed no evidence of immune cell infiltration (Figure 2B and 
Figure 3A). Immunostaining of WT and calnexin-deficient lumbar spinal cord section for markers of T 
cells, macrophages, and microglia (CD3ε, GFAP, IBA-1, F4/80) also showed no evidence of infiltration of 
these cells in calnexin-deficient EAE mice (Figure 3, A and B). Next, we analyzed the abundance of tran-

scripts encoding inflammation-specific genes in the spinal cords from control and EAE-induced mice (Fig-
ure 3C). The mRNAs for T cell receptor CD3ε, early activation marker; CD69, marker of inflammation; 
macrophage/microglia activation marker F4/80; GFAP; and cytokines IL-17, IL-1β, IL-6, and GM-CSF 
were dramatically increased in WT mice with induced EAE (Figure 3C). In agreement with histological 
analysis (Figure 2B and Figure 3A) of CNS tissue from calnexin-deficient animals with induced EAE, there 
was no induction of mRNA encoding any of the tested inflammation markers (Figure 3C).
To test the specificity of calnexin in conferring resistance of the Canx–/– mice to the EAE induction, we 
generated Canx–/– mice reconstituted with a transgene (Tg-CanxFL) that directs the ubiquitous expression 
of the full-length calnexin protein. Immunoblot analysis of cells isolated from the Canx–/–-Tg-CanxFL mice 
confirmed the abundance of full-length calnexin protein and calnexin mRNA in the reconstituted mice 
(Figure 4, A and B). The Canx–/–-Tg-CanxFL exhibited normal motor function phenotype (18) with respect 
to conduction velocity analyses of peripheral motor and sensory axons (Figure 4, C and D). Importantly, 
the susceptibility of the Canx–/–-TG-CanxFL to induction of EAE was similar to that observed in WT or 
heterozygote animals (Figure 2A). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that global deletion of the 
calnexin gene in mice was protective against development of EAE and was associated with the impaired 
transmigration of encephalitogenic lymphocytes into the CNS parenchyma of Canx–/– mice. Furthermore, 
resistance to EAE required calnexin absence because susceptibility to EAE was restored by expression of 
the recombinant full-length calnexin protein in calnexin-deficient mice.
Peripheral immune response was not affected by the loss of  calnexin. Next, we asked whether calnexin defi-
ciency impacted the development and function of the peripheral immune system and, hence, resistance of 
the calnexin-deficient mice to EAE induction. MS is an autoimmune disease in which antibodies and T 
cells targeting myelin antigens are present in the blood (21). The induction of EAE by immunization of 
mice with MOG35–55 leads to the appearance of anti-MOG antibodies and encephalogenic T cells in blood 
from immunized mice upon onset of the disease (22). Consequently, secreted anti-MOG antibodies and T 
cells are pathogenic and contribute to demyelinating EAE episodes. Sera from WT and Canx–/– mice treated

with MOG35–55 were collected and used as the primary antibodies for immunoblot analysis of brain samples 
(Figure 5, A and B). Sera from non-EAE mice were used as a negative control, and purified recombinant 
MOG protein (recMOG; AnaSpec, 14.3-kDa) was used as a positive control (Figure 5, A and B). Immu-
noblot analysis indicated that both WT and calnexin-deficient mice immunized with MOG35–55 produced 
anti-MOG antibodies (Figure 5, A and B), indicating that, with MOG35–55 antigen presentation, the produc-
tion and secretion of γ antibodies were not affected in the absence of calnexin. Furthermore, we found no 
difference in the number of CD4+/CD3+ and CD8+/CD3+ cells and MHC class I and MHC class II expres-
sion between WT and calnexin-deficient splenocytes challenged with MOG35–55 (Supplemental Figure 1; 
supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.98410DS1). 
We concluded, therefore, that the functional adaptive immunity was not compromised in Canx–/– mice and 
did not contribute to EAE resistance exhibited by Canx–/– mice.
In agreement with anti-MOG immunoblotting results (Figure 5, A and B), multiplex array analysis of 
cytokine production in the periphery showed no differences between WT and Canx–/– mice (Figure 5C). 
IL-17 is recognized to play a role in the development and progression of EAE and MS (23). Both stimulated 
WT and Canx–/– T cells and T cells isolated from EAE-induced animals secreted IL-17 (Figure 5, D and E). 
Most importantly, there were similar differences in IL-17 secretion between stimulated WT and Canx–/– T

cells (Figure 5, D and E). Taken together, these findings indicated that the EAE resistance observed in cal-
nexin-deficient animals was not caused by a reduced number of circulating activated immune cells, by their 
ability to produce and secrete proinflammatory cytokines, by altered function of antigen presenting cells, or 
by the ability of B cells to produce and secrete antibodies.
Targeted calnexin deficiency in T cells did not protect mice from clinical signs of  EAE. To further evaluate the 
involvement of T cells in induction of EAE, we generated mice with flox sequences incorporated in the 
calnexin gene (Canxfl/fl) and crossed them with mice expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of 
the Lck proximal promoter (Lck-Cre+ mice), which is predominantly active in T cells (24–26). This cross 
produced Canxfl/fl/Lck-Cre+ mice with a deletion of 794 bp from exons 3 and 4 of the Canx gene in T cells 
(27). The specific inactivation of the Canx gene in T cells of Canxfl/fl/Lck-Cre+ mice was confirmed by 
immunoblot analysis of the thymus (Figure 6A). Remarkably, FACS analysis revealed that the thymus, 
spleen, and peripheral T cell populations were not affected by the targeted inactivation of the calnexin 
gene in the T cells of Canxfl/fl/Lck-Cre+ mice (Figure 6B) and demonstrated that the absence of calnexin 
had no significant impact on the development of the immune system. Next, we inoculated WT and 
Canxfl/fl/Lck-Cre+ mice with MOG35–55. Like WT mice, Canxfl/fl/Lck-Cre+ mice developed EAE symptoms 
(Table 1), indicating that calnexin deficiency in T cells specifically did not interfere with the recruitment 
of encephalitogenic lymphocytes into the CNS and the induction of EAE.
Transendothelial migration of  T cells across the brain endothelium was inhibited in the absence of  calnexin. A pivotal 
feature of MS pathogenesis is that proinflammatory T cells in the blood cross the blood-brain barrier, resulting 
in focal inflammation and demyelination. Thus, we asked if the function of the blood-brain barrier was altered 
in the absence of calnexin and whether this was responsible for protection of Canx–/– mice against EAE induc-
tion. To address this question, we used a mouse brain endothelial cell line, bEND.3 (28, 29), which serves as a 
cell culture model for studies of the blood-brain barrier endothelium. First, we found that cytokine-stimulated 
bEND.3 CNS endothelial cells displayed an increased abundance of calnexin immunoreactivity (Figure 7A). 
This finding recapitulated our observations in human brain sections from MS patients (Figure 1) and supported 
the notion that calnexin expression might be increased in the blood-brain barrier endothelial cells of MOG35–
55–treated mice. Next, we used an in situ gene-editing technique to generate calnexin-deficient bEND.3 cells 
(Canx–/–-bEND.3) (Figure 7B and Supplemental Figure 2). WT bEND.3 cells and Canx–/–-bEND.3 cells showed 
a similar response to IL-1β, TNF-α or IFN-γ cytokine with respect to expression of VCAM1 and ICAM1 (Fig-
ure 7C). Cytokine stimulation of WT and calnexin-deficient bEND.3 cells also resulted in increased abundance 
of tight junction molecules PECAM and JAM-A (Figure 7D). Next, using a monolayer of bEND.3 cells as a 
tissue culture model of the endothelium, we tested whether absence of calnexin impacted on blood-brain barrier 
endothelial cells function with respect to T cell transendothelial migration. WT stimulated T cells were added 
to the upper chamber containing a layer of cytokine-stimulated WT or Canx–/–-bEND.3 cells, followed by FACS 
analysis of the T cells crossing the endothelial cell layer into the bottom chamber (Figure 7E). As expected, there 
was significant transmigration of WT T cells across cytokine-stimulated WT bEND.3 cells (Figure 7E). In stark 
contrast, transendothelial migration of T cells across cytokine-stimulated Canx–/–-bEND.3 cells was significantly 
reduced (Figure 7E), demonstrating that the impairment of calnexin function in CNS endothelial cells in Canx–/– 
mice underlies the resistance of these mice to EAE induction.
Discussion
As a molecular chaperone, calnexin has been implicated in immunity because of its capacity to regulate 
the folding and assembly of the MHC class I complex or folding of the T cell receptor (30). During devel-
opment, calnexin is highly expressed in the nervous system, and elimination of calnexin in mice results in 
peripheral axonal dysmyelination, resulting in reduced nerve conduction velocities (18–20). These findings 
revealed that the protein is important for the development and function of the nervous system. Here, we 
discovered a high abundance of calnexin protein in the brains of MS patients, suggesting that increased

calnexin expression contributes to the pathogenesis of MS. The relevance of CNS calnexin to the occur-
rence of MS is demonstrated by our finding that mice lacking calnexin become resistant to EAE, despite 
the appearance of anti-MOG antibodies in the blood of calnexin-deficient mice immunized with MOG35–55 
peptide. Importantly, in MOG35–55 immunized calnexin-null mice without neurobehavioral deficits, circu-
lating lymphocytes secreted proinflammatory cytokines but showed no signs of immune cell infiltration 
into the CNS or induction of transcripts encoding inflammatory genes within the CNS. The importance 
of calnexin in the susceptibility to inflammatory demyelination was demonstrated by transgene-directed 
reexpression of calnexin in Canx–/– mice. The seemingly paradoxical results of this study, demonstrating 
that calnexin deficiency leads to dysmyelination and impaired peripheral motor function (18-20) while con-
ferring protection against inflammation of the CNS in response to induction of EAE, suggest that calnexin 
is important for myelin formation, but in EAE, an elevated abundance of calnexin is associated with the 
pathogenic cascade that eventually culminates in the progressive destruction of the myelin.

MS is classified as a chronic progres-
sive autoimmune disease of the CNS in 
which proinflammatory T cells, sensitized 
to myelin proteins, cross the blood-brain 
barrier, resulting in inflammatory demy-
elination. EAE in mice, an established 
model of MS, is characterized by exten-
sive infiltration of the CNS by inflamma-
tory cells (22). Initiation of EAE involves 
the activation of myelin-specific Th17 
cells (22). Th17 cells, which produce 
inflammatory cytokines, including IL-17, 
are critical mediators of tissue damage in EAE (22). We found no difference in IL-17 secretion between 
T cells isolated from WT and Canx–/– mice immunized with MOG35–55, ruling out any contribution of 
IL-17 in EAE protection seen in the calnexin-deficient mice. Importantly, mice with targeted inactivation 
of the calnexin gene in T cells offered no resistance to EAE, as these mice developed EAE to the same 
level of severity exhibited by WT mice with EAE. These findings indicated that the absence of calnexin 
did not affect activation and expansion of myelin-specific T cells in the periphery during EAE, despite 
the relative protection against EAE development in calnexin-deficient mice.
Since T cell–specific inactivation of calnexin did not recapitulate the resistance to EAE exhibited by 
mice with global calnexin deficiency, we examined the transmigration of T cells across the blood-brain 
barrier using bEND.3 cells as a model of brain endothelial cells (29). Canx–/–-bEND.3 cells showed normal 
responses to stimulation by cytokines with respect to upregulation of cell adhesion molecules but failed to 
support transendothelial migration of T cells. This finding demonstrates that blocking of T cell migration 
across the blood-brain barrier underlies the observed resistance of calnexin-deficient mice to EAE. Block-
age of lymphocytes binding to brain endothelium and reduction of lymphocyte transendothelial migration 
into brain parenchyma has long been considered a target for MS therapeutics development (31, 32). Several 
adhesion molecules have been implicated in the binding of lymphocytes to inflamed blood vessels in the 
brain of mice with EAE. Blockade of VCAM1 interaction with integrin α4 localized on the cell surface of 
lymphocytes reduces the clinical severity of EAE (32) and is the basis for MS therapy. Interestingly, anti-
bodies inhibiting binding of leukocytes to other endothelial proteins, including ICAM1, do not influence 
lymphocyte binding to the blood-brain barrier (33).
Cytokine-stimulated Canx–/–-bEND.3 cells express increased levels of VCAM1, ICAM1, and tight 
junction proteins, yet transendothelial migration of T cells is effectively blocked to protect calnexin-defi-
cient mice against EAE. Calnexin is a type 1 integral ER membrane protein with a large portion of the 
C-terminal domain oriented to the cytoplasm (34, 35) and interacting with cytoplasmic proteins, includ-
ing UBC9 (SUMOylation E2 ligase) (36), protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (36), N-myristoyltransferase 
1 (37), and SGIP1 (16). While screening for calnexin interacting partner proteins in the nervous system, 
we discovered that the fatty acid binding protein 5 (Fabp5), a member of a family of highly conserved 
cytoplasmic proteins that bind long-chain fatty acids and other hydrophobic ligands, binds to the cyto-
plasmic domain of calnexin (38). It has been reported that a deficiency in Fabp5 also protects against 
EAE (39, 40). It is tempting to speculate that the calnexin/Fabp5 complex is a component of neuropro-
teostasis and lipidostasis (41). The dysregulation of calnexin/Fabp5 function may be a key event in the 
pathogenesis of MS and represents an important target for therapeutics development aimed at promoting 
favorable clinical outcomes for patients afflicted with MS.
Methods
Human CNS tissue and grading. Snap-frozen postmortem CNS tissue blocks were obtained from both 
normal (n = 10) and MS (n = 18) cases with varying degrees of lesion inflammation at autopsy, with 
donor or next-of-kin informed consent for tissue donation from the NeuroResource tissue bank. MS 
lesions were classified into acute, subacute, and chronic on the basis of the number and distribution 
of Oil Red O–positive macrophages, myelin loss, and the cellularity in the borders and parenchyma of 
lesions. Clinical data were collected as shown in Supplemental Table 1 (42).

calnexin gene in the T cell lineage, mice carrying floxed calnexin exons (exon 3 and 4) Canxfl/fl (27), were 
crossed with Lck-Cre+ transgenic mice (C57BL/6), which express the Cre recombinase under the control 
of the T cell–specific Lck promoter (The Jackson Laboratory, B6.Cg-Tg[Lck-cre]548Jxm/J]. Presence of 
the flox and Cre recombinase alleles was confirmed by PCR analysis using the following set of DNA 
primers: 
5′-GCTCTGGATGCCTTGGGATTTGATTTCC-3′; 
5′-GGATTTAGTGGATATCCCCAG-
TATGAGC-3′; Cre-F2, 5′-GCCAGCTAAACATGCTTCATC-3′; Cre-B2, 5′-ATTGCCCCTGTTTCAC-
TATCC-3′. Mice used in the present study carried double-flox and single Cre recombinase alleles.
An expression vector designed for ubiquitous expression under the ROSA26 promoter was used to 
generate transgenic mice expressing full-length calnexin protein on a CD1 WT mouse background, des-
ignated Canx–/–-TG-CanxFL. Transgene expression was determined by PCR using the following set of 
DNA primers: 2N forward, 5′-GGAGGAGCGCTTCCGGCCGACG-3′; 2N reverse, 5′-CCACCCTGA-
CAGAGACCCTCTGTC-3′; 2C forward, 5′-CGGAGAATGGGAGGCTCCTCAGAT T-3′; 2C reverse, 
5′-GCAAGAAAGCGAGCTTCTAGATGGCC-3′. Mice were bred by crossing CD1 WT mice express-
ing full-length calnexin transgene with WT C57BL/6 mice. To generate calnexin rescue mice, WT CD1/
C57BL6 mice expressing the transgene were crossed with calnexin-deficient mice, and the heterozygote 
progeny with the transgene were bred again with calnexin-deficient mice, producing animals with the 
transgene on a calnexin-deficient background. Multifiber motor and sensory conduction studies were 
carried out using previously published protocols (18).
EAE induction. Adult mice were injected s.c. in each hind leg with 50 μg of MOG35–55 (Peptide Syn-
thesis Facility, University of Alberta) emulsified in 100 μl CFA (MilliporeSigma). Animals received 0.3 
μg/ml of pertussis toxin injected i.p. Injection of pertussis toxin (List Biological Laboratories) occurred

immunized with CFA and PBS (1:1) and pertussis toxin, as above. Animals were assessed daily for 
EAE clinical symptoms. A scoring system from 0–5 for clinical assessment of EAE symptoms was used 
(https://hookelabs.com/services/cro/eae/MouseEAEscoring.html). EAE scores were obtained daily 
and were calculated for each mouse during the time course of the disease. Time course graphs represent

17 days after immunization. Levels of serum cytokines (GM-CSF, INF-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, 
IL-7, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, MCP-1, TNF-α) were evaluated using the Milliplex MAP Mouse Cytokine/
Chemokine Immunoassay (MilliporeSigma, Milliplex MAP Kit Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine 96-well 
plate assays, MPXMCYTO70KPMX13) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Histochemistry. Mice were perfused with PBS, with the brain and spinal cord tissues fixed in 10% formalin 
and with paraffin-embedded sections stained with H&E. IHC staining of formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded 
lumbar section of spinal cords were deparaffinised and rehydrated using decreasing concentrations of etha-
nol. The slides were boiled in 0.01 M trisodium citrate buffer, pH 6, for 20 minutes followed by incubation 
with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide to block endogenous peroxidases. Sections were then preincubated with block-
ing buffer (LI-COR) for several hours to block nonspecific binding. To detect selected immune cells markers, 
sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-CD3ε (Serotec, catalog MCA500GA), anti-F4/80 (Abcam, 
catalog AB6640), anti-IBA1 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., catalog 019-19741), anti-GFAP (Dako, 
catalog M0761) antibodies at 1:100 dilution, followed by secondary biotinylated antibody, avidin–biotin–per-
oxidase complexes (Vector Laboratories) and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride (Vector Laboratories). For 
quantification, spinal cord sections were scanned and photographed using Axioskop2 (Carl Zeiss MicroIm-
aging Inc.). For quantitative analysis, a number of cells positive for CD3ε, IBA-1, F4/80, and GFAP were 
determined in 3 standardized, randomly placed fields of view of 50 μm2. Cells were counted within the white 
matter around the dorsal horn of the spinal segments using Optical Light Microscope (Optica).
Cell culture and generation of  the Canx–/–-bEND.3 cell line. The bEND.3 cell line was purchased from ATCC 
(CRL-2299) and cultured under recommended conditions. Cells were cultured in DMEM media supple-
mented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS at 37oC and 5% CO2. Disruption of the calnexin gene in the bEND.3 cell 
line was achieved with 2 paired sgRNAs designed to excise a large part of the gene. We used sgRNAs 5′ - 
CACCGTAGTATAGGGAGTCTTGTCG - 3′; 5′ - CACCGTAAACCTCCCCTGTTGGAAC - 3′, which 
were generated with the web-based tool http://crospr/mit.edu. Construction of the sgRNA coding vector 
was performed by ligating each sgRNA into the plasmid SpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro (Px459) V2.0 (a gift from 
Feng Zhang [Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA; 
Addgene plasmid 62988]). Top and bottom oligos were prepared and ligated with the vector as described 
(43). DH5α E. coli–competent cells were transformed with the ligation mixture. Colonies were picked, and 
DNA extraction was performed. Positive ligation was confirmed with DNA sequence analysis. bEND.3 
cells at a confluency of 70%–90% were transfected using TurboFect Transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific). Transfection was performed according to manufacturer’s recommended protocol designed for 
adherent cells. Pairs of sgRNAs were used to mediate effective gene disruption. Individual clones were 
isolated from the cell population transfected with sgRNAs and assayed by both PCR and immunoblot 
analysis, to confirm successful inactivation of the calnexin gene. For PCR analysis, genomic DNA from the 
modified region was amplified using primers outside of the sgRNAs binding sites: forward, 5′-GCCTTGG-
GATTTGATTTCCT-3′; reverse, 5′-GATCTGCATCTGGCCT-3′. PCR product amplified from transfected 
bEND.3 cells reflected a deletion of 3,198 bp. To further confirm deletion of part of the calnexin gene, the 
amplicon was sequenced to reveal the exact sites of the deletion (Supplemental Figure 2). Immunoblot 
analysis was carried out with anti-calnexin antibodies raised against a peptide derived from the C-terminal 
of calnexin (Assay Designs, SPA-860, synthetic peptide corresponding to last 19 C-terminal residues of 
amino acid sequence of calnexin [residues 575–593; NH3
+-AEEDEI LNRSPRNRKP RRE-COO–]).
Transendothelial migration analysis. WT or calnexin-deficient bEND.3 cells were plated onto 12-well 
plates and cultured for 24–48 hours until cells formed an intact monolayer. The endothelial cell monolayer 
was treated for 24 hours with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) (eBioscience, Affymetrix) or TNF-α (3 ng/ml) (Invitrogen), 
and IFN-γ (60 ng/ml) (eBioscience, Affymetrix) added to the culture media. For transmigration experi-
ments, bEND.3 cells were plated onto transwell inserts (Corning, 5 μm). Primary cultures of WT mouse 
splenocytes were isolated. Briefly, spleens were carefully removed, sliced into small pieces and placed on 
a 70-μm cell strainer, and treated with RBC lysing buffer according to the protocol, with a cell suspension 
of 1 × 106 cells/ml in the final preparation. Cells were activated with plate-bound CD3 antibodies (5 μg/
ml eBioscience) and soluble CD28 antibodies (2 μg/ml eBioscience). On the day of the experiment, T cells 
were labeled with CFSE (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s protocol. The CFSE-labeled cell suspen-
sion was added to the monolayer of bEND.3 cells and incubated for 3 hours. Next, fluorescently labeled 
leucocytes from the lower well were collected, washed 3 times with PBS, and counted using flow cytometry.
Flow cytometry. Flow cytometry analysis was carried out using BD FACSCanto flow cytometer (BD

Biosciences) and FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) for acquisition and FlowJo for analysis (Tree Star 
Inc.). Cells were washed in PBS with 2% heat-inactivated FBS and stained with designated cocktails of 
fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies for 1 hour at 4˚C in the dark. Fluorochrome conjugated monoclonal 
antibodies were obtained from eBioscience and included: CD3ε (clone 145-2C11), CD4 (clone RM4-5), 
CD8a (clone 53-67), CD11b (clone M1/70), CD11c (clone N418), CD69 (clone H1.2F3), MHC I (clone 
H-2Db), MHC II (clone I-A/I-E).
Quantitative PCR. Murine lumbar spinal cords were homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), 
and total RNA was isolated and purified using RNeasy mini columns (Qiagen). Complementary DNA 
(cDNA) was prepared by oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription of mRNA using iScript cDNA Synthe-
sis Kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocols. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) 
was performed using Bio-Rad iQ 2 SYBR green supermix, using the Rotor Gene Q (Qiagen), according 
to the manufacturer’s recommended protocols.
T cell activation and cell proliferation assays. Purified CD4+ T cells from healthy control WT mice were cul-
tured in 24-well plates (1 × 106/ml) and stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (eBioscience; 
5 μg/ml each). Culture plates were then incubated for 48 hours at 37°C.
Splenocytes were isolated from EAE-induced C57BL/6 mice at day 17. Briefly, total splenocytes were 
seeded at 2 × 105 cells/well in a 96-well round-bottomed plate with or without MOG35–55 (20 μg/ml) pep-
tide for 5 days, followed by subsequent fixation and flow cytometric analysis. DMEM supplemented with 
10% FBS (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 1% 
nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen) were used for cell culture.
IL-17 secretion assay. Mouse IL-17 Secretion Assay Cell Enrichment and Detection Kit (MACS, 
Miltenyi Biotec) was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Mouse splenocytes were stim-
ulated with PMA/ionomycin for 4 hours to achieve IL-17 secretion. Subsequently, cells were incubated 
with IL-17–specific Catch reagent that attached to the cell surface. Secreted IL-17 was bound to the Catch 
reagent; next, positive cells were labeled with IL-17–specific antibody. To detect IL-17–secreting positive 
cells, mouse IL-17 detection antibody conjugated with biotin and anti–biotin-R-phycoerythrin (PE) anti-
bodies were used. Cells were magnetically labeled with anti-PE microbeads that allowed enrichment of the 
IL-17–secreting cells over a MACS column placed in the magnetic field of the MACS separator. Magneti-
cally labeled cells bound to the column and were later eluted and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Statistics. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Software, and results are presented as the 
mean ± SEM. Two-tailed Student’s t tests were performed when appropriate. A significant difference was 
determined as follows: *P ≤ 0.05; **P ≤ 0.01; ***P ≤ 0.001.

and were approved by Biosafety Officers at the Department of Environment, Health and Safety at the Uni-
versity of Alberta. All animal experiments were carried out according to the University of Alberta Animal 
Policy and Welfare Committee and the Canadian Council on Animal Care Guidelines. The approval for
