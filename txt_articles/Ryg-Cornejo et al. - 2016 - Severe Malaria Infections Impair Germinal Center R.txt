SUMMARY
Naturally acquired immunity to malaria develops only
after years of repeated exposure to Plasmodium par-
asites. Despite the key role antibodies play in protec-
tion, the cellular processes underlying the slow
acquisition of immunity remain unknown. Using
mouse models, we show that severe malaria infec-
tion inhibits the establishment of germinal centers
(GCs) in the spleen. We demonstrate that infection in-
duces high frequencies of T follicular helper (Tfh) cell
precursors but results in impaired Tfh cell differenti-
ation. Despite high expression of Bcl-6 and IL-21,
precursor Tfh cells induced during infection dis-
played low levels of PD-1 and CXCR5 and co-ex-
pressed Th1-associated molecules such as T-bet
and CXCR3. Blockade of the inflammatory cytokines
TNF and IFN-g or T-bet deletion restored Tfh cell dif-
ferentiation and GC responses to infection. Thus, this
study demonstrates that the same pro-inflammatory
mediators that drive severe malaria pathology have
detrimental effects on the induction of protective B
cell responses.
INTRODUCTION
Malaria is one of the most serious infectious human diseases,
and there are �250 million clinical cases of it annually. Most
cases of severe disease are caused by Plasmodium falciparum,
which remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity
worldwide. Humans with no previous experience of malaria
almost invariably become ill on their first exposure to the parasite
(Miller et al., 2002). They develop a febrile illness that may
become severe and, in a proportion of cases, leads to death.
Severe malaria cases are associated with various disease syn-
dromes, including respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis, renal
failure, pulmonary edema, and cerebral malaria (White and Ho,
1992). Although the precise mechanisms leading to severe dis-
ease are not completely understood, it is accepted that the
sequestration of blood-stage parasites in the blood vessels of
target organs and a strong pro-inflammatory response are
important determinants of disease induction. High levels of cyto-
kines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (Molyneux et al., 1993),
interferon g (IFN-g), and interleukin 1b (IL-1b) (Pongponratn et al.,
2003) as well as chemokines, including CCL4, CXCL10, and
CXCL8 (Armah et al., 2007; Jain et al., 2008), have been found
to be associated with disease severity. Although severe clinical
manifestations of malaria ameliorate following a few infections,
immune effector mechanisms capable of controlling parasite
growth develop only after repeated exposure over a number of
years. This form of protection does not result in sterilizing immu-
nity but prevents clinical episodes by substantially reducing the
parasite burden. Naturally acquired immunity is known to require
antibody responses because passive transfer of sera from clini-
cally immune individuals significantly protects non-immune re-
cipients from high parasitemia and disease symptoms (Cohen
et al., 1961).
Despite the key role antibodies play in protection against ma-
laria, little is known about the cellular processes underlying the
slow acquisition of humoral immunity. Epidemiological evidence
suggests that antibodies to P. falciparum antigens are generated
inefficiently, and responses are lost in the absence of ongoing
exposure (Kinyanjui et al., 2007, 2009). These findings suggest
that the development of B cell memory might be compromised
during infection. Recent studies have indicated that children
and young adults in areas of high seasonal transmission are
characterized by a delayed development of memory B cells spe-
cific for P. falciparum despite repeated exposure to the parasite
(Weiss et al., 2010). In contrast, individuals living in areas of low
transmission that experience fewer clinical episodes appear to
generate malaria-specific memory B cells that are stable even
in the absence of frequent boosting (Wipasa et al., 2010). Overall,
these observations suggest that the inflammatory responses
contributing to clinical episodes of severe malaria have a
68

 detrimental effect on the development of humoral immunity. In
support of this view, histological studies have revealed that hu-
man fatal malaria infections are accompanied by dramatic
changes in splenic architecture (Urban et al., 2005), including
dissolution of the marginal zone, loss of B cells, and reduced for-
mation of germinal centers (GCs) required for the development of
memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells.
Using murine malaria models, a few studies have investigated
alterations occurring in spleens during infection and their conse-
quences for the development of B cell responses (Achtman
et al., 2003; Beattie et al., 2006; Carvalho et al., 2007). Most
of the available information has been generated using the
non-lethal Plasmodium chabaudi infection model and demon-
strates that, despite transient changes of the splenic architec-
ture, infected mice are able to mount adequate antibody re-
sponses and control parasitemia (Achtman et al., 2003;
Ndungu et al., 2009). Unlike P. chabaudi, infection of mice
with Plasmodium berghei ANKA results in induction of severe
malaria. This infection has many features in common with hu-
man disease and is the best available model for certain aspects
of clinical malaria (Hansen, 2012). As in humans, sequestration
of parasitized red blood cells (pRBCs) in target organs and a
strong inflammatory response have been identified as the
main determinants of disease (Hansen, 2012). Inflammatory re-
sponses mediated by cytokines and chemokines such as TNF
(Grau et al., 1987), IFN-g (Grau et al., 1989), and CXCL10 (Nie
et al., 2009) and effector cells such as CD8+T (Belnoue et al.,
2002), natural killer T (NKT) cells (Hansen et al., 2003), and nat-
ural killer (NK) cells (Hansen et al., 2007) contribute to the induc-
tion of severe malaria in this model. Loss of splenic architecture
has been found to accompany the onset of severe disease in
this model (Carvalho et al., 2007), but the implications of these
processes for the induction of humoral responses to the para-
site are unclear.
Acquisition of humoral immunity requires a specialized sub-
set of T cells, named T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, that orches-
trate the GC reaction and the differentiation of memory B cells
and long-lived plasma cells (Crotty, 2011). A number of features
define Tfh cells, including expression of the transcriptional
regulator Bcl-6, which induces the expression of CXCR5 and
migration of Tfh cells into the GC. Tfh cells are also character-
ized by high PD-1 and inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS)
expression, strong IL-21 secretion, and low CCR7 expression
(Tangye et al., 2013). Tfh cell differentiation requires initial con-
tacts with dendritic cells (Choi et al., 2011) and prolonged inter-
actions with GC B cells to reinforce the Tfh cell phenotype
(Crotty, 2014). Similar to other T helper subsets, Tfh cell differ-
entiation is modulated by cytokine signals. IL-6 and IL-21 are
positive mediators of Tfh cell differentiation (Karnowski et al.,
2012), whereas IL-2 inhibits Tfh fate (Ballesteros-Tato et al.,
2012). Furthermore, inflammatory cytokines, including IL-12,
type I IFNs, and IFN-g, have been found to modulate these pro-
cesses (Lee et al., 2012; Nakayamada et al., 2011; Oestreich
et al., 2012; Ray et al., 2014). Interestingly, these cytokines
are produced in response to rodent malaria infections (Hansen,
2012), but it is unknown whether they contribute to defective B
cell responses. To address this question, humoral responses
were investigated using the P. berghei ANKA model of severe
malaria. Our results reveal that the same pro-inflammatory
pathways mediating severe disease syndromes have a detri-
mental effect in the development of B cell responses by inhib-
iting Tfh cell differentiation and compromising GC responses
required
for
the
efficient
induction
of
antibody-mediated
immunity.
RESULTS
Inefficient Induction of Antibody-Secreting Plasma Cells
during Severe Malaria Infection
To investigate the role of antibody responses in the control of
parasitemia, C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and Prdm1fl/flCd19Cre
mice in which B cell-specific deletion of the transcription factor
Blimp-1 impairs the development of plasma cells (Shapiro-She-
lef et al., 2003) were infected with P. chabaudi chabaudi AS or
P. berghei ANKA. Strikingly, the absence of plasma cells in
mice infected with the self-resolving P. chabaudi chabaudi AS
strain resulted in the development of high parasitemia and death
(Figures 1A and 1B), confirming a key role for antibody responses
in the control of parasite replication during a mild malaria infec-
tion. In contrast, P. berghei ANKA-infected Prdm1fl/flCd19Cre
mice developed cerebral malaria at rates identical to WT control
animals (Figure 1C), with highly similar parasitemia levels
between the two groups (Figure 1D), suggesting that antibody
responses are unable to contribute to the control of parasitemia
during a severe malaria infection.
To further investigate the effect of severe malaria on the
development of B cell responses to infection, we compared
antibody responses of C57BL/6 mice after infection with
P. berghei ANKA or after immunization with irradiated para-
sites (irradiated P. berghei ANKA [iPbA]). Because P. berghei
ANKA infection is invariably lethal in C57BL/6 mice, infected
animals were cured with anti-malarial drugs after the onset
of disease symptoms on day 5 post-infection (p.i.) to allow
assessment of responses at late times post-exposure. At this
time, infected mice experienced �5% parasitemia, which is
equivalent to �3 3 108 pRBCs. To ensure a similar antigenic
load in the two groups of experimental mice, three doses of 1
3 108 pRBCs, 2–3 days apart, were administered during the
immunization schedule with iPbA. Therefore, this approach al-
lows the comparison of immune responses to P. berghei
ANKA in the presence or absence of the disease symptoms
and inflammatory responses associated with severe malaria
(Figure S1). One week after treatment completion, iPbA-immu-
nized C57BL/6 mice had mounted a parasite-specific antibody
response five times higher than P. berghei ANKA-infected
mice (Figure 1E).
The induction of plasma cell responses was investigated us-
ing both WT and Prdm1GFP reporter mice, which express GFP
in all antibody-secreting cells (Kallies et al., 2004). Plasma cell
differentiation in response to P. berghei ANKA infection was
impaired severely in comparison with mice immunized with
iPbA (Figures 1F–1H). Furthermore, the proportion of isotype-
switched plasma cells was diminished severely (Figure 1F).
Together, these results suggest that severe malaria compro-
mises the development of humoral immune responses to
infection.

To determine whether P. berghei ANKA-mediated severe malaria
episodes are accompanied by reduced GC formation in the
spleen, as occurs in human malaria, we compared the responses
of C57BL/6 mice after infection with P. berghei ANKA or after im-
munizationwithiPbA.Infectedmiceweredrug-curedasdescribed

ulin D (IgD) to reveal B cell follicles, anti-CD3 to detect T cell zones,
and anti-GL7 for detection of GCs. Spleen sections from iPbA-
immunized mice maintained their splenic architecture and re-

Consistentwithpreviousstudies(Achtman
et al., 2003; Beattie et al., 2006; Carvalho
et al., 2007), sections from malaria-in-
fected mice displayed a disturbed white
pulp structure with a striking loss of
TcellsfromTcellzonesandadisorganized

mice experiencing an active infection
lackedGCsondays6and9p.i.(Figure2A).
From day 12 p.i. onward, after infected
mice had been treated with anti-malarial
drugs and the infection was controlled,
the splenic architecture was restored
gradually, and GCs started to develop. To
confirm these observations, GC B cells
were examined further by flow cytometry.
The frequency and total numbers of GC B
cells (CD19+CD38lowGL7+) in P. berghei
ANKA-infected mice were reduced signifi-
cantly compared with iPbA-immunized mice until resolution of
infection by day 12 p.i. (Figures 2B and 2C).
To investigate the consequences of impaired GC reactions, the
frequency and number of memory B cells (CD19+IgD�CD138�
CD38high) were analyzed in P. berghei ANKA-infected mice or
iPbA-immunized counterparts (Figures 2D and 2E). The number
of memory B cells induced in response to infection was signifi-
cantly lower than that obtained after immunization with irradiated
parasites (Figure 2E). Moreover, the absolute number of isotype-
switched Blimp-1high long-lived antibody-secreting cells was
reduced in infected micecompared with iPbA-immunized controls

 (Figure S2). Together, these results indicate that severe malaria
infection impairs the establishment of GC reactions.
Severe Malaria Infection Inhibits Tfh Cell Differentiation
To investigate whether the impaired GC responses observed in
severe malaria-susceptible mice reflected a defect in the Tfh
compartment, the frequency and total number of these cells
(defined as CD4+CXCR5highPD-1high) were examined in spleens
of P. berghei ANKA-infected mice (drug-cured on day 5 p.i.) or
mice receiving equivalent doses of iPbA. Figure 3A shows that
the percentage of Tfh cells was reduced significantly in mice
that experienced a severe malaria infection compared with those

 immunized with iPbA. Detailed examination of the activated
compartment (CD4+CD62L�) revealed the presence of a second
population of Tfh-like cells expressing intermediate levels of both
CXCR5 and PD-1 (Figure 3B). These cells have been described in
other infection models and appear to be precursors of fully
mature Tfh cells (Ramiscal and Vinuesa, 2013). Consistent with
their precursor nature, CXCR5intPD-1int Tfh cells induced in
response to infection did not efficiently localize to GCs or B

 cell follicles (Figure S3). Interestingly, despite a clear defect in the
mature Tfh cell compartment (Figures 3A–3C) in malaria-infected
mice compared with animals immunized with iPbA, both the per-
centage and the number of precursor Tfh cells were similar be-
tween the two groups (Figures 3B and 3D). Analysis of the ratios
between precursor Tfh cells and mature Tfh cells revealed that,
although approximately two precursors were found for each
mature Tfh cell in animals immunized with iPbA, spleens from
P. berghei ANKA-infected mice had nearly 15 times as many
pre-Tfh cells as mature Tfh cells on day 6 p.i. Together, these re-
sults indicate that severe malaria infection compromises the dif-
ferentiation of precursor Tfh cells into mature Tfh cells.
The transcription factor Bcl-6 is the master regulator of Tfh cell
differentiation, and its specific expression allows the identifica-
tion of Tfh cells. To confirm that the population of CXCR5int
PD-1int cells induced in the response to infection belonged to
the Tfh cell lineage, the expression of Bcl-6 was analyzed in
gated CD4+ T cells 6 days after infection with P. berghei ANKA
or after immunization with iPbA. Although the frequency of
Bcl6+ CD4 T cells was increased in the spleens of P. berghei
ANKA-infected mice, the absolute number of these cells was
significantly
higher
in
spleens
of
iPbA-immunized
mice
compared with infected animals (Figures 3F and 3G). Further
analysis revealed that both mature Tfh cells and Tfh cell precur-
sors could be found among CD4+Bcl-6+ cells of iPbA-immunized
mice. In contrast, the vast majority of CD4+ T cells expressing
Bcl-6 in response to infection were CXCR5intPD-1int Tfh cell pre-
cursors (Figure 3F), supporting the concept that Tfh cell differen-
tiation is compromised during malaria infection.
Tfh Cells Induced in Response to Malaria Infection
Secrete IL-21 and Co-express Th1 Cell Markers
To investigate the capacity of Tfh cells induced in response to
malaria to secrete IL-21, Il21GFP reporter mice (L€
uthje et al.,
2012) were infected with P. berghei ANKA or immunized with
iPbA. Higher frequencies of IL-21+CD4+ T cells were found in in-
fected mice compared with iPbA-immunized controls on day 6
but not on day 12 p.i. (Figure 4A). However, the absolute number
of these cells was equivalent between the two groups (Figure 4B).
Similar to Bcl-6 expression, IL-21 production after 6 days of
infection was found to arise primarily from CXCR5intPD-1int Tfh
precursors, whereas a similar percentage of both mature Tfh
cells and pre-Tfh cells produced IL-21 in response to immuniza-
tion with iPbA (Figure 4A). After resolution of infection on day 12
p.i.,
IL-21
production
could
be
also
detected
in
the
CXCR5highPD-1high Tfh cell compartment. Interestingly, 40%–
50% of pre-Tfh cells and Tfh cells co-expressed IFN-g and
TNF after infection with P. berghei ANKA, whereas, after immu-
nization, only about 20% of pre-Tfh cells and Tfh cells produced
these cytokines (Figure S4). Only low frequencies of IL-10-pro-
ducing Tfh cells could be detected after infection or immuniza-
tion with irradiated parasites (Figure S4).
Emerging evidence (Weinmann, 2014) suggests that environ-
mental signals mediated by cytokines determine the balance be-
tween Th1 and Tfh differentiation by modulating the expression
of the transcription factors T-bet and Bcl-6. To determine
whether the inflammatory milieu during severe malaria drives
helper T cell differentiation toward Th1 development, the expres-
sion of T-bet was determined in Tfh lineage cells (Figure 4C) after
P. berghei ANKA infection or immunization with iPbA. Despite
reduced expression of CXCR5 and PD-1 (Figures 4F and 4G),
the expression of T-bet was significantly higher in Bcl-6+CD4
T cells in spleens of P. berghei ANKA-infected mice compared
with iPbA-immunized controls (Figure 4E). The same was true
when T-bet expression was examined in pre-Tfh cells or
CXCR5highPD1-1high cells (Figure S4). The expression of the che-
mokine receptor CXCR3, a hallmark of severe malaria infections
(Hansen et al., 2007) and a transcriptional target of T-bet, was
also examined. Almost 100% of Bcl-6+CD4+ T cells generated
in response to infection expressed CXCR3 compared with only
60% of those derived from iPbA-immunized controls. Together,
these results demonstrate that severe malaria infection induces
the development of a population of CXCR5intPD-1int pre-Tfh cells
that share phenotypic features with Th1 lineage cells.
Pro-inflammatory Cytokines Produced during Severe
Malaria Infection Inhibit Tfh Cell Differentiation
To determine whether, in the absence of inflammatory signals
associated with severe malaria, pre-Tfh cells undergo normal dif-
ferentiation, an adoptive transfer strategy was pursued. Ly5.2+
Irf4fl/flCd4Cre mice, which lack IRF4 expression specifically in
the T cell compartment, were used. Because IRF4 is required
for Tfh cell differentiation (Bollig et al., 2012), these mice provide
an efficient system to assess the helper capacity of adoptively
transferred Tfh cells because GC responses are supported
exclusively by donor-derived Tfh cells. CD4+CD62L� cells from
Ly5.1+ P. berghei ANKA-infected or iPbA-immunized mice
were isolated on day 6 p.i. and adoptively transferred into
Irf4fl/flCd4Cre that were pre-primed with iPbA. Before the adop-
tive transfer, the majority of Tfh cells from P. berghei ANKA-in-
fected mice expressed only intermediate levels of CXCR5 and
PD-1 (Figure 5A). In contrast, 6 days after the transfer, nearly
20% of the Ly5.1+ CD4+ T cells were CXCR5highPD-1high cells
in animals receiving cells from iPbA-immunized or malaria-in-
fected donors (Figure 5A; Figure S5A). We did not detect Tfh
cells among Irf4fl/flCd4Cre host cells, validating this model for

comparable with mice that had received
cells from immunized donors. Together,
these results indicate that, in the absence
of inflammatory signals, pre-Tfh cells
induced during malaria infection undergo
normal differentiation and support GC
reactions.
IFN-g and TNF are inflammatory cyto-
kines known to play a critical role in the in-
duction of severe malaria. To investigate
whether these cytokines were involved
in the inhibition of GC activity and Tfh
cell differentiation observed during infec-
tion, mice were infected with P. berghei
ANKA
and
treated
with
anti-IFN-g-
and anti-TNF-neutralizing antibodies or
isotype controls. Neutralization of pro-
inflammatory
cytokines
significantly
increased the number of mature Tfh cells
produced
in
response
to
infection
compared with isotype control-treated
mice (Figures 6A and 6C). Similar results
were obtained after infection of Ifng�/�
mice (Figure S6) or animals treated with
anti-IFN-g
alone
(data
not
shown),
although the effect was less pronounced than when both IFN-g
and TNF were neutralized. The ratio of pre-Tfh cells to Tfh cells
was reduced significantly in anti-cytokine-treated
animals
compared with isotype controls (Figure 6D). Moreover, neutrali-
zation of pro-inflammatory cytokines also resulted in a 3-fold
expansion of the splenic GC B cell pool (Figure 6E), a marked
improvement of splenic architecture, with increased retention
of T cells in T cell zones as well as improved GC structures

 (Figure 6F) and significantly higher parasite-specific IgG re-
sponses to infection (Figure 6G). Together, these results indicate
that the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-g and TNF negatively
regulate Tfh cell differentiation during severe malaria infection
and inhibit GC reactions.
Expression of T-bet Impairs Tfh Cell Differentiation
during Severe Malaria
T-bet (encoded by the Tbx21 gene) is induced by Th1-type
inflammation and has been found previously to promote severe
malaria pathogenesis (Oakley et al., 2013) and modulate the
development of Tfh cell responses (Nakayamada et al., 2011).
Therefore, we evaluated the effect of T-bet expression on Tfh
cell differentiation throughout infection using a mixed bone
marrow chimera approach. Mice were reconstituted with a 1:1
mix of congenically marked Ly5.1+ WT and Ly5.2+ Tbx21�/�
(T-bet
knockout
[KO])
bone
marrow
and
infected
with
P. berghei ANKA (Figure 7A). The capacity of each donor
compartment to mount Tfh cell responses to infection was as-
sessed by flow cytometry. As expected, T-bet and CXCR3 upre-
gulation occurred by day 6 p.i. in WT but not in Tbx21�/�
CD62L-CD4+ T cells (Figures 7A and 7B). Importantly, T-bet-defi-
cient CD4+ T cells resulted in significantly higher Bcl-6 expres-
sion (Figure 7F) and gave rise to significantly higher frequencies
of mature Tfh cells (Figures 7C and 7D) compared with WT cells.
No differences were found among compartments of control chi-
meras reconstituted with Ly5.1+ WT and Ly5.2+ WT bone
marrow (data not shown). Chimerism levels in both WT:WT and
WT:Tbx21�/� remained approximately 1:1 throughout the infec-
tion period. Importantly, mixed chimeras containing T-bet-defi-
cient cells allowed the establishment of GC structures in the
spleen (Figure 7G), promoted the induction of GC B cells signif-
icantly more efficiently (Figure 7H), and gave rise to significantly
higher IgG1 but reduced IgG2a parasite-specific antibody titers
compared with control chimeras (Figures 7I–7K). Therefore,
T-bet negatively regulates Tfh cell development during severe
malaria infection.
DISCUSSION
Naturally acquired immunity to malaria develops only after
repeated exposure to the parasite over a number of years. The
cellular processes underlying the slow and imperfect acquisition
of immunity are still not understood. Using a mouse model of se-
vere malaria, this study provides mechanistic insights into
cellular processes that are impaired during the development of
B cell responses to infection. Our study establishes that compro-
mised Tfh cell responses are responsible for reduced GC
activity. Moreover, this study identifies critical factors modu-
lating these processes and demonstrates that the same pro-in-
flammatory
responses
mediating
severe
malaria
disease
syndromes also have a detrimental effect on the induction of pro-
tective immunity by inhibiting Tfh cell differentiation.
Other studies have investigated B cell responses in mouse
models of malaria, primarily using the non-lethal P. chabaudi
infection. Although a concomitant P. chabaudi infection has
been found to suppress humoral responses to secondary heter-
ologous antigens (Millington et al., 2006; Wilmore et al., 2013),
most of the available evidence indicates that, despite transient
changes of splenic architecture, P. chabaudi-infected mice
mount adequate parasite-specific B cell responses required to
control parasitemia, with IL-21 production playing a critical role
in this process (Achtman et al., 2003; Ndungu et al., 2009;
Pe
´ rez-Mazliah et al., 2015). Our study is well aligned with those
findings because mice lacking plasma cells were unable to con-
trol P. chabaudi replication, illustrating a key role for antibody re-
sponses in the control of infection in a self-resolving model of
malaria. In contrast, during P. berghei ANKA infection, extrafol-
licular plasmablast responses as well as GC reactions were
generated inefficiently, and Tfh cell differentiation was inhibited,
demonstrating that severe malaria affects GC dependent and in-
dependent responses.
CD4+ T cells perceive their cytokine environment by signaling
through signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
proteins that lead to the upregulation of transcriptional regulators
that guide differentiation toward distinct T helper subsets. During
Tfh cell differentiation, the molecular balance between the
opposing helper T cell lineage-specifying transcription factors
T-bet and Bcl-6 regulates flexibility in the Th1 and Tfh cell gene
programs
(Weinmann,
2014).
Excessive
T-bet
expression
directly antagonizes Bcl-6 function by masking the DNA binding
domain required to regulate the Tfh gene expression program
(Oestreich et al., 2012). In line with this concept, the strong in-
flammatory milieu accompanying severe malaria appeared to
block Tfh cell development, giving rise to high frequencies of
Tfh cell precursors expressing T-bet and Th1 lineage molecules
such as CXCR3. Furthermore, genetic ablation of T-bet during
infection allowed efficient differentiation of mature Tfh cells,
demonstrating that the expression of this transcription factor
directly represses Tfh cell responses during severe malaria

 infection. IFN-g, a key mediator of severe disease in the
P. berghei ANKA model (Grau et al., 1989), also inhibited Tfh
cell differentiation, suggesting that signaling through STAT-1
might contribute to the upregulation of T-bet within the Tfh cell
compartment.
T-bet expression was also responsible for the upregulation of
CXCR3 on Tfh cells of malaria-infected mice. The expression of
this receptor is a hallmark of P. berghei ANKA infection and al-
lows lymphocytes to migrate to the brains of infected mice,
where they contribute to the development of cerebral malaria
(Hansen et al., 2007). It is possible that CXCR3 expression
among Tfh cells favors their egress outside the spleen, which
may contribute to the depletion of a functional Tfh cell compart-
ment required to sustain humoral immunity.
Apart from inducing Th1 features in Tfh cells, inflammatory cy-
tokines also contributed to the loss of splenic architecture char-
acteristic of acute malaria. Blockade of TNF and IFN-g improved
GC formation and also facilitated the retention of T cells within
the white pulp. Both cytokines have been found previously to
modulate tissue remodeling in other infection models. Whereas
IFN-g responses to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)
have been shown to downregulate the expression of CCL21,
required for localization of T cells in T cell zones (Mueller et al.,
2007a), TNF produced in response to Leishmania donovani me-
diates the loss of fibroblastic reticular cells, responsible for the
production of this homeostatic chemokine (Ato et al., 2002).
Because changes in the location of B cells, T cells, and anti-
gen-presenting cells affects access to antigen and cellular inter-
actions, it has been proposed that the loss of secondary
lymphoid organ structure impairs immune responses to infection
(Ato et al., 2002; Choi et al., 2003; Mueller et al., 2007a, 2007b).
Interestingly, Tfh cells are particularly dependent on cell-cell in-
teractions because they rely on B cell-derived signals for their
development and maintenance. Surface expression of ICOS
(Liu et al., 2015) and CD28 (Salek-Ardakani et al., 2011) as well
as signaling lymphocytic-activating molecule (SLAM) family
members such as CD84 and Ly108 have emerged as important
factors involved in T:B cell engagement required for efficient Tfh
cell differentiation (Ramiscal and Vinuesa, 2013). It is conceiv-
able that the disorganized splenic structure characteristic of
acute malaria does not facilitate the interactions between B cells
and T cells required to sustain Tfh cell differentiation. Therefore,
our results support a model in which inflammatory responses to
malaria impair GC reactions by two non-exclusive mechanisms:
direct upregulation of T-bet in Tfh precursors, which interferes
with correct Tfh cell differentiation, and disruption of the splenic
architecture, which impairs T:B cell interactions required to sus-
tain this process.
Similar to our findings using a severe malaria infection model,
it has been shown recently that acute P. falciparum malaria in-
duces the activation of circulating PD-1+CXCR5+CXCR3+ Tfh
cells, which appear to have a limited helper capacity (Obeng-
Adjei et al., 2015). Although these findings revealed the nega-
tive effect a single malaria episode has on the development
of humoral immunity, the results shown here also indicate
that control of parasitemia and severe disease by treatment
with anti-malarial drugs allows the establishment of GC re-
sponses. In line with those observations, field studies have
shown that individuals living in low transmission settings (Wi-
pasa et al., 2010) are able to efficiently mount parasite-specific
B cell memory. Further mechanistic work is required to estab-
lish whether frequent clinical episodes are responsible for the
delayed acquisition of immunological of B cell memory, as
observed in individuals residing in high transmission areas
(Weiss et al., 2010). A better understanding of the factors that
impair humoral immunity is of vital importance because it
may lead to the development of therapeutic approaches to
improve the efficacy of immune responses to the malaria
parasite.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mice and Infections
All mice used throughout this study, including Il21GFP, Prdm1GFP, Prdm1fl/fl,
Ifng�/�, Irf4fl/fl, and Tbx21�/� mice, were on a C567BL/6J background. Eight-
to twelve-week-old mice were infected intravenously (i.v.) with 5 3 104–1 3 105
P. berghei ANKA or P. chabaudi chabaudi AS pRBCs. Parasitemia was as-
sessed from Giemsa-stained smears of tail blood, and mortality was checked
daily. In some experiments, mice were treated with a dose of chloroquine
(10 mg/kg) and pyrimethamine (10 mg/kg) intraperitoneally (i.p.) at the onset
of severe malaria symptoms on day 5 p.i., followed by treatment with drinking
water containing chloroquine and pyrimethamine (10 mg/kg) for 7 days. In im-
munization experiments, mice received three i.v. injections of 1 3 108 irradi-
ated (20,000 rad) P. berghei ANKA pRBCs 2–3 days apart. For cytokine
blockade experiments, mice were injected i.p. every other day from day 1
p.i. with anti-IFN-g (HB170, 0.5 mg) and anti-TNF (XT-22, 0.2 mg) or 0.7 mg
of anti-rat IgG1 isotype control antibody. All experiments were performed in
compliance with the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute Animal Ethics Committee
requirements.
Generation of Bone Marrow Chimeras
Lethally irradiated (two doses of 550 Cy 3 hr apart) Ly5.1 mice were reconsti-
tuted with equal numbers of bone marrow cells from Ly5.1 mice and Tbx21�/�
(Ly5.2) or WT (Ly5.2) controls. Chimeric mice were allowed to reconstitute for
8 weeks before use in malaria infections.
ELISA for Detection of Malaria-Specific Antibodies
Microtiter plates were coated with P. berghei ANKA lysate (5 mg/ml) in carbon-
ate buffer (pH 9.6) by overnight incubation at 4�C. Empty sites were blocked
with 5% skim milk for 1 hr at 37�C. After washing with 0.05% Tween 20 in
PBS, plates were incubated with antisera in serial dilutions for 1 hr at 37�C.
The plates were washed and incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated rabbit
anti-mouse antibody (Pierce). Isotype titers were determined after incubation
with anti-IgM, -IgG1, or -IgG2a antibodies (Zymed), followed by incubation
with a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Pierce). Bound com-
plexes were detected by reaction with tetramethyl-benzidine (KBL) and H2O2.
Absorbance was read at 450 nm.
Immunofluorescence Staining and Confocal Microscopy
Spleens were snap-frozen in optimum cutting temperature compound, and 5-
mm sections were mounted on Polysine slides prior to fixation in 100% ice-cold
acetone. Endogenous biotin was blocked using an avidin/biotin blocking kit
prior to staining with Alexa 488 anti-IgD (11-26c.2a), biotin-conjugated GL7,
and Alexa 647-conjugated CD3 (RM4-5) for 2 hr at room temperature. Second-
ary streptavidin-conjugated-Alexa 568 was used to detect anti-GL7 staining.
In some experiments, allophycocyanin (APC) anti-CD45.1 (A20) was used.
Slides were mounted in ProLong Gold antifade medium. Images were ac-
quired with a 203 objective on a Zeiss LSM 780 laser-scanning confocal
system.
Flow Cytometry
Splenocyte suspensions were stained with the fixable viability dye efluor-506
(eBioscience) for dead cell exclusion, followed by incubation with anti-CD16/

 CD32 antibody in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) staining buffer.
Cells were washed twice prior to incubation with fluorescent antibodies for
45 min at 4�C. For analysis of GC B cells, cells were stained with fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) anti-CD38 (90/CD38), phycoerythrin (PE) anti-GL7 and
PerCPCy5.5 anti-CD19 (1D3), or PE Cy7anti-CD4 (RM4-5, BioLegend), brilliant
violet 650 anti-CD19 (1D3, BioLegend), APCCy7 anti-CD62L (MEL-14,
BioLegend), PE anti-PD-1 (J43), PerCPCy5.5 anti-CXCR5 (2G8), and APC
anti-CXCR3 (173, BioLegend) for the analysis of Tfh cells. Memory B cells
were detected with PECy7 anti-CD38 (90, BioLegend), PerCPCy5.5 anti-
CD19 (1D3), FITC anti-CD138 (281-2), and FITC anti-IgD (11-26c.2a). When
required, secondary streptavidin conjugates were added for 30 min at 4�C
following sample washes (all antibodies were from BD Pharmingen unless indi-
cated otherwise). Anti-CD45.1 (A20, BioLegend) and CD45.2 (104, BioLegend)
antibodies were used to identify congenically marked cells. For intracellular
staining, cells were stained with surface markers and then fixed/permeabilized
using the Foxp3/transcription factor staining buffer set (eBioscience). Anti-
bodies to Bcl-6 (K112-91) and T-bet (4B10) were then added for 45 min at
room temperature. The cells were then washed twice, resuspended in PBS,
and analyzed with a BD LSR II W or Fortessa X20. Analysis was performed
with FlowJo X 10.0.7 (Tree Star).
Adoptive Transfer
Ly5.1 C57BL/6 mice were infected with 5 3 104 P. berghei ANKA pRBCs. On
day 6 p.i., CD4+CD62L� spleen cells were isolated by sorting on a BD Aria W
system. In some experiments, pre-Tfh and mature Tfh cells were isolated.
Sorted cells were adoptively transferred (1 3 106 cells/mouse) into Ly5.2
Irf4fl/flCD4Cre or WT recipients immunized previously with two doses of 1 3
108 irradiated pRBCs (2 days apart). Spleen cells and sera from recipient an-
imals were collected on days 2, 6, or 9 post-transfer for assessment of immune
responses.
Statistical Analysis
Student’s t test was used for data evaluation of datasets with confirmed
normal distribution. Other datasets were evaluated using Mann-Whitney
nonparametric test. Multiple comparisons were evaluated by t tests corrected
with the Holm-Sidak method. Differences in mortality rates of malaria-infected
mice were assessed by Cox-Mantel log rank analysis.
