Abstract
Among the many pathophysiologic consequences of traumatic brain injury are changes in 
catecholamines, including dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. In the context of TBI, 
dopamine is the one most extensively studied, though some research exploring epinephrine and 
norepinephrine have also been published. The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence 
surrounding use of drugs that target the catecholaminergic system on pathophysiological and 
functional outcomes of TBI using published evidence from pre-clinical and clinical brain injury 
studies. Evidence of the effects of specific drugs that target catecholamines as agonists or 
antagonists will be discussed. Taken together, available evidence suggests that therapies targeting 
the catecholaminergic system may attenuate functional deficits after TBI. Notably, it is fairly 
common for TBI patients to be treated with catecholamine agonists for either physiological 
symptoms of TBI (e.g. altered cerebral perfusion pressures) or a co-occuring condition (e.g. 
shock), or cognitive symptoms (e.g. attentional and arousal deficits). Previous clinical trials are 
limited by methodological limitations, failure to replicate findings, challenges translating therapies 
to clinical practice, the complexity or lack of specificity of catecholamine receptors, as well as 
potentially counfounding effects of personal and genetic factors. Overall, there is a need for 
additional research evidence, along with a need for systematic dissemination of important study 
details and results as outlined in the common data elements published by the National Institute of 
Neurological Diseases and Stroke. Ultimately, a better understanding of catecholamines in the 
context of TBI may lead to therapeutic advancements.

 1. Introduction
Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a significant public health problem in the United States. In 
2010 alone, an estimated 2.5 million TBI cases presented for treatment and it is likely that 
many more cases went unreported (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015). The 
mechanism of injury varies greatly and includes motor vehicle accidents, falls, and gunshot 
wounds, to name a few; the unpredicatable nature of TBI complicates the establishment of 
preventative measures. Thus it is imperative to identify effective treatments that prevent 
secondary injury (NIH, 1998). While TBI has become a largely survivable condition, an 
estimated 50% of TBI survivors live with long-term functional deficits (Kraus et al., 2005; 
Thurman et al., 1999). Post-TBI, deficits are common in several functional domains, 
including: learning (e.g. information processing), memory (short- and long-term), executive 
function (e.g. problem solving; impulse control) and/or other areas (e.g. language; attention; 
agitation; mood/affect) (Arciniegas et al., 2000; Dyer et al., 2006; Oddy et al., 1985; Sun and 
Feng, 2013). TBI survivors have elevated rates of mental health symptoms including: 
depression (Jorge et al., 2004; Moldover et al., 2004; Seel et al., 2003), agitation (Bogner et 
al., 2015), impulsivity, and verbally aggressive behavior (Dyer et al., 2006). Cognitive, 
behavioral, and mood symptoms are distressing and challenging to cope with. These 
symptoms may also impair the survivor’s ability to return to pre-injury roles (e.g. work, 
family, social) and contribute to caregiver burden (Binder, 1986).
Though changes in behavior may occur without measurable changes in physiology, the 
aforementioned TBI long-term deficits are often accompanied by changes in key brain 
structures known to control the functions affected, including the hippocampus, thalamus, 
and frontal cortex (Bramlett and Dietrich, 2002; Lifshitz et al., 2007; Vertes, 2006). Beyond 
the brain structures themselves, there are post-TBI alterations in brain cell communication 
via changes in underlying neurotransmitter systems; pathologic changes in these systems 
represent potential therapeutic targets for novel TBI therapies. The focus of this invited 
review is limited to one family of neurotransmitters: the catecholaminergic system. 
Catacholamines neurotransmitters fall into the monoamine family, which are derived from 
aromatic amino acids (e.g. L-tyrosine) and have a characteristic structure comprised of an 
amino group connected to a ring by a short double carbon chain. Catecholamines bind to 
adrenergic receptors (e.g. α; β), which are found throughout the body. This system is known 
to be altered following TBI; an acute catecholamine surge can be detected in the form of 
increased plasma levels (Hamill et al., 1987; Tran et al., 2008; Woolf et al., 1987). Moreover, 
there are commercially available drugs that target these neurotransmitters either directly or 
indirectly. In fact, some catecholamines (e.g. norepinephrine; dopamine) are commonly 
administered vasopressors used to raise cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and mean arterial 
blood pressure (MAP) after TBI; use of catecholamines has been associated with clinically-
relevant increases in CPPs that varied depending on which catecholamine was given in 
studies of pediatric- (Di Gennaro et al., 2011) and adult-(Sookplung et al., 2011) TBI. There 
is also clinical evidence associating use of norepinephrine- and dopamine-agonist stimulants 
with less severe agitation after TBI (Bogner et al., 2015). Despite the association between 
catecholamine therapy outcomes, relatively little causal evidence exists and what has been 
published is largely limited to pre-clinical trials. Moreover, there is no consensus regarding

 how to best exploit catecholamine therapies to promote TBI recovery given the diversity of 
TBI patients and complexities of clinical care.
The purpose of this review is to synopsize the evidence regarding therapeutic applications of 
catecholamines in the context of pre-clinical and clinical TBI. The evidence cited will come 
from pre-clinical research, which represents the bulk of the available data; however, when 
available, published clinical evidence will be incorporated. In this reveiw, three main 
catecholamines will be discussed in detail: dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. In 
the context of TBI, dopamine is the best studied catecholamine and will thus be emphasized 
in this review; epinephrine and norepinephrine will be discussed in less detail due to the 
relative dearth of published evidence. Moreover, other less common catecholamines were 
excluded from this review due to insufficient evidence specific to TBI. It is also notable that 
the 3 neurotransmitters emphasized in this review are produced in a sequential pathway 
starting with L-tyrosine which is processed into L-dihydroxyphenyalanine (L-DOPA), 
dopamine, norepinephrine, and eventually epinephrine (see Figure 1). For each 
catecholamine discussed, a brief overview will be provided with attention given to evidence 
specific to the changes reported in the context of TBI. For each catecholamine, broad classes 
of drugs (e.g. agonist; antagonist) will be discussed, emphasizing evidence specific to 
therapeutic effects reported in the context of TBI and similar conditions.
2. Dopamine
2.1 Overview
Of the catecholamines found within the CNS, dopamine (DA) is most common (Cosentino 
and Marino, 2013; Vallone et al., 2000), Two brain regions are primarily responsible for DA 
synthesis, the substantia nigra pars compacta and the ventral tegmental area (Dalley and 
Roiser, 2012; Nieoullon, 2002; Seamans and Yang, 2004; Vallone et al., 2000). Several 
detailed descriptions of dopamine synthesis have been published previously and a summary 
is provided in Figure 1 (Elsworth and Roth, 1997; Fernstrom, 1983; Icard-Liepkalns et al., 
1993; Milner and Wurtman, 1986; Misu and Goshima, 1993). Dopamine has several 
receptors to which it binds (e.g. D1, D2, D3, D4). Some drugs bind selectively or 
preferentially to one or more receptor subtype, as will be discussed in section 2.2 and 2.3.
In addition to receptors, the DAergic system includes several notable structures throughout 
the CNS. The ascending DAergic pathways is comprised of two parts: 1) the nigrostriatal 
pathway and 2) the mesocorticolimbic pathway (Alexander and Crutcher, 1990; Graybiel, 
1990; Haber et al., 2006, 2000), both pathways are important for various functional 
outcomes known to be relevant to TBI symptomatology. The nigrostriatal system has been 
implicated in spatial learning/memory. Lesions to the nigrostriatal pathway are associated 
with alterations in behavioral strategy selection when faced with spatial navigation 
challenges such as the Morris water maze (Mura and Feldon, 2003). Moreover, the 
nigrostriatal system also has a role in reward processing (Wickens et al., 2007). Some of the 
cognitive symptoms associated with TBI, that also occur in Parkinson’s Disease (PD), have 
been attributed to the characteristic nigrostrial system changes underlying PD pathology 
(Ridley et al., 2006; Tamaru, 1997). The mesocorticolimbic pathway plays an important role 
in memory consolidation (Cools et al., 1993; Ploeger et al., 1994, 1991; Setlow and 
Osier and Dixon

 McGaugh, 1998), motivation (Baldo and Kelley, 2007; Mitchell and Gratton, 1994; 
Salamone, 1994), and addiction (Berridge, 2006; Di Chiara and Bassareo, 2007; Ikemoto, 
2007; Salamone et al., 2005; Sutton and Beninger, 1999). This system has been implicated 
in neuropsychiatric disorders and conditions more boardly related to stress and mood (Abi-
Dargham and Moore, 2003; Sonuga-Barke, 2005; Tidey and Miczek, 1996; Viggiano et al., 
2003). In the context of TBI, less is known about the role of the mesocorticolimbic system. 
However, evidence from another neurocritical care disorder, stroke, has found damage to this 
region is associated with fatigue (Tang et al., 2013, 2010), a symptom experienced by an 
estimated 80% of TBI survivors (Cantor et al., 2013).
There are also several published changes to the DAergic system after TBI. Acutely, DA 
levels are elevated in several parts of the brain, whereas in the long-term, DA levels are 
depressed (Huger and Patrick, 1979; Kline et al., 2004; McIntosh et al., 1994). Changes in 
gray and white matter comprising the DAergic system have been reported after TBI 
(Bramlett and Dietrich, 2002; Hutson et al., 2011; J. M. Meythaler et al., 2001; Reeves et al., 
2007). Other pathophysiological changes in the dopaminergic (DAergic) system after TBI 
include altered DA: production (Kobori et al., 2006), activity (Kobori et al., 2006; Shin et al., 
2012), transmission (Henry et al., 1997; Huger and Patrick, 1979; Kline et al., 2004; 
McIntosh et al., 1994), and metabolism (Massucci et al., 2004). Metabolism of DA in 
microglial cells is altered within the first day of TBI and persists out to two weeks (Redell 
and Dash, 2007). Longer-term evidence of disrupted DA metabolism after TBI is suggested 
by chronic changes in DA transporter (DAT) expression (Wagner et al., 2009, 2005b); DAT 
binding was reduced 4–5 months following a TBI (Donnemiller et al., 2000; Wagner et al., 
2007), without overt physiological damage (See Figure 2). Further evidence supporting the 
role of DA in TBI pathology surrounds the neuroprotective events occurring within certain 
brain regions (e.g. hippocampus; thalamus) which require interaction between DA and 
glutamate (Centonze et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2007; Granado et al., 2008; O’Carroll et al., 
2006). The known effects of TBI on the DAergic system have led to trials of drugs targeting 
DA as agonists, antagonists, or via indirect mechanisms (as described in sections 2.2, 2.3 
and 2.4). Though translation is limited, the promise of DAergic therapies was included in 
The Neurotrauma Foundation (NTF) report covering the foundation’s therapeutic 
recommendations for TBI (Warden et al., 2006)
2.2 Dopamine Agonists
To-date, a number of preclinical TBI studies have been conducted testing DA agonists, most 
of which began therapy within a day of TBI and continued chronically. Based on the 
available evidence, DAergic agnonists have shown promise for the treatment of TBI both 
acutely and into the long-term (Bales et al., 2009; Gualtieri and Evans, 1988; Kaelin et al., 
1996; Zweckberger et al., 2010), a few key examples of which are discussed below, sorted 
by specific agonist drug. In addition to the agonists described in 2.2.1, 2.2.2, and 2.2.3, 
dopamine is sometimes given in the form of Inotropin therapy, which acts via alpha-1 and 
beta-1 receptors. Inotropin therapy is known to have drug-drug interactions with several 
classes of drugs including some that may be administered as part of TBI management or for 
treatment of a comorbid condition (e.g. halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics; monoamine

 oxidase inhibtitors; phenytoin; triclyclic antidepressants); thus, dopamine is typically 
agonized using one of the drugs listed below instead.
2.2.1 Bromocriptine—Bromocriptine is an agonist specific to the D2 receptor, which is 
known to protect neurons in the cortex from the toxic effects of glutamate (Kihara et al., 
2002). Bromocriptine treatment following experimental TBI enhanced working and spatial 
memory; these changes were associated with reduced oxidative damage (Kline et al., 2004, 
2002). The Neurotrauma Foundation (NTF) recommendations include bromocriptine, which 
has also been found to be positively associated with favorable outcomes related to executive 
functioning (Warden et al., 2006). In a placebo-controlled crossover study of 24 TBI 
survivors, bromocriptine was found to improve executive function and duel-task 
performance, though other assessments of cognitive function showed no effect (McDowell et 
al., 1998). A recent clinical study used functional MRI (fMRI) verbal working memory task 
to compare TBI survivors to health controls 1 month after initial injury testing the effects of 
bromocriptine on verbal working memory performance; though healthy controls had better 
memory performance after bromocriptine administration, responsivity to this DAergic drug 
was not evident in TBI survivors (McAllister et al., 2011).
2.2.2 Amantadine—Amantadine is another agonist of the DAergic system (Gianutsos et 
al., 1985; Von Voigtlander and Moore, 1971), which, like bromocriptine, was recommended 
by the NTF (Warden et al., 2006). In addition to its role as a DA agonist, amantadine is 
known to antagonize N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type glutamate receptors; this non-
specific nature of amantadine complicates studying the effects and underlying mechanism of 
this drug in the context of brain injury (Kornhuber et al., 1994). Amantadine has been well 
studied in the context of both pre-clinical and clinical TBI where it has been found to 
support cognitive function (Stelmaschuk et al., 2015). In the context of pre-clinical TBI 
modeled using controlled cortical impact (CCI), amantadine has been found to ameliorate 
post-CCI Morris water maze deficits; yet, it did not significantly improve motor deficits with 
the injury parameters and treatment regimens trialed (Dixon et al., 1999). Following fluid 
percussion injury (FPI) in rats, a higher dose of amantadine treatment was associated with 
higher survival rates of CA2 and CA3 pyramidal neurons, along with beneficial effects on 
cognitive testing (Wang et al., 2013). Another FPI study found that after amantadine therapy 
there was both attenuation of DA-release deficits and subsequent functional deficits (Huang 
et al., 2014). In clinical trials, amantadine is associated with beneficial outcomes on 
measures of agitation (Chandler et al., 1988) as well as overall rate of functional recovery 
assessed using the Disablity Rating Scale (Giacino et al., 2012). In a study of severe TBI 
patients amantadine treatment was associated with better outcomes on Glasgow Coma Scale 
(GCS) and Glascow Outcomes Scale (GOS), along with lower mortality when compared to 
standard-of-care controls (Saniova et al., 2004). Though overall amantadine seems to be a 
promising therapy (Spritzer et al., 2015; Stelmaschuk et al., 2015), some studies have failed 
to find significant effects on TBI outcomes including irritability (Hammond et al., 2015).
2.2.3 Dopamine Agonists Used in Parkinson’s Disease—Other agonists of the 
DAergic pathway, such as ropinirole and pramipexole, have demonstrated protective effects 
in the context of PD (Schapira, 2009), indicating possible therapeutic applications in TBI.

 These agonists act by binding to DA receptor and are implicated in the prevention of 
oxidative stress (Nair and Sealfon, 2003). In the context of TBI, pramipexole has been used 
to treat certain symptoms of sleep disorders, specifically sleep-related limb movements 
(Castriotta and Murthy, 2011). In addition to acting on DA several receptor subtypes (D2, 
D3, and D4) with preferential binding to D3 (Piercey, 1998), pramipexole may have 
additional effects on neurotrophic factors (Du et al., 2005). One study of pramipexole found 
treatment reduced death of nigrostriatal neurons following ischemia (Hall et al., 1996). In a 
pediatric TBI study, pamipexole resulted in faster rates of change on the Coma/Near Coma 
Scale, Western NeuroSensory Stimulation Profile, and Disability Rating Scale (Patrick et al., 
2006).
2.2.4 Stimulants—Methylphenidate (MPD) is associated with rapid processing and 
improved attention (Warden et al., 2006) and has been trialed as a TBI therapeutic with 
conflicting results (Mooney and Haas, 1993; Speech et al., 1993). Specifically, MPD inhibits 
DAT, and taking MPD has been associated with improved memory and attention when 
administered in the long-term after brain injury (Gualtieri and Evans, 1988; Lee et al., 2005; 
Pavlovskaya et al., 2007). Additional evidence suggests that administration of MPD is also 
associated with favorable cognitive outcomes (Kaelin et al., 1996; Plenger et al., 1996; 
Whyte et al., 2004). In the context of cortical ablation and impact, MPD treatment 
ameliorates deficits in cognitive function observed after experimental brain injury induced 
using CCI or ablation (Kline et al., 2000, 1994). Spikes in DA observed following MPD 
administration are associated with better cognitive outcomes after experimental TBI 
(Schiffer et al., 2006; Volkow et al., 2004). In TBI clinical trials, MPD has demonstrated 
therapeutic benefits(Volz, 2008). Both pre-clinical and clinical studies suggest that the drug 
works via DAT blockade (Volkow et al., 2002a, 2002b, 1998).
Amphetamine (AMPH) has many cellular effects including stimulating DA release and 
blocking reuptake (Kahlig and Galli, 2003), leading to elevated extracellular DA and 
subsequently prolonged striatal DAergic signaling (Calipari and Ferris, 2013). In addition, 
DA removes unwanted cellular debris (e.g. free fatty acids; lactate) from the cortex and 
hippocampus (Dhillon et al., 1998). After TBI, AMPH is known to be involved in post-
injury plasticity and synaptogenesis (Goldstein, 2003; Ramic et al., 2006); these reported 
benefits may be related to the induction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Griesbach et 
al., 2008). It is also known that AMPH leads to decreased utilization of cerebral glucose 
after experimental TBI (Queen et al., 1997). Recovery after pre-clinical TBI is accelerated 
with AMPH treatment (Barbay and Nudo, 2009; Chudasama et al., 2005; Dhillon et al., 
1998; Hovda et al., 1989; M’Harzi et al., 1988). Unfortunately, translating AMPH to clinical 
care is difficult because it impacts other monoamines (Fleckenstein et al., 2007); moreover it 
is well- established that the drug has the potential for abuse and dependence. Further 
complicating the use of AMPH is the fact that D2 agonists are commonly used to treat TBI 
patients yet they may counteract the effects of AMPH (Feeney et al., 1982). 
Methamphetamine, a stimulant which binds has also been evaluated in experimental TBI 
with mixed results (Rau et al., 2012; Shen et al., 2011).

 2.2.5 Reuptake Inhibitors—Further evidence that the DAergic system contributes to 
post-TBI inflammation comes from drug trials demonstrating decreased inflammation can 
be achieved by targeting DA pathways; for example, the selective norepinephrine and 
dopamine reuptake inhibitor buproprion (Stahl et al., 2004), which is used traditionally to 
treat depression, has also been found to have anti-inflammatory effects following brain 
injury (Brustolim et al., 2006). However, there remains some concern that there is a role for 
inflammatory cells in post-TBI neuroprotection which may complicate treatment with anti-
inflammatory agents (Ekdahl et al., 2009; Kriz, 2006). In the context of PD, degeneration of 
DA neurons may be related to elevated cytokines (e.g. TNF, IL-1beta, IL-6, and TGF-alpha) 
and decreased neurotrophins (e.g. BDNF) which contributes to inflammation (Färber and 
Kettenmann, 2005; Nagatsu et al., 2000). Similarly, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs) have been trialed in the context of TBI. In a mouse model, fluoxetine has been 
found to promote neurogenesis and moderate epigenetic factors, though no effects on 
functional outcomes were detected (Wang et al., 2011). A rat model did find beneficial 
effects on functional outcomes of TBI with chronic SSRI treatment (Mahesh et al., 2010). In 
clinical studies, the SSRI sertraline was trialed but no beneficial effects were detected 
(Baños et al., 2010; J. Meythaler et al., 2001); another clinical study showed little 
improvement when sertraline was compared to placebo (Ashman et al., 2009). Conversely, 
one study showed transient beneficial effects of sertraline on depression; though significant 
group differences were seen at 3 months, the trend did not persist over time when assessed 
out to 1 year (Novack et al., 2009). Taken together, existing evidence suggests that DA may 
moderate inflammatory processes within the brain, though there is a need for additional 
research.
2.3 Dopamine Antagonists
Interestingly, there are also reported benefits associated with administration of DA 
antagonists. For example, beneficial effects have been published in several neurological 
conditions including models of brain lesion, ischemia, and excitotoxicity (Armentero et al., 
2002; Okada et al., 2005; Yamamoto et al., 1994; Zou et al., 2005). Following concussive 
injury in mice, acute treatment (15 min) with selective antagonists of the D2 receptor lead to 
beneficial effects; moreover, an additive effect of treatment was noted when D1 and D2 
receptors were antagonized in combination (Tang et al., 1997). Compared to DA agonists, 
the therapeutic effects of DA antagonists after brain injury remain less clear, though acute 
administration may have anti-excitoxicity effects. Overall, there is a need for future research 
aimed at testing various DA antagonists.
Some commonly prescribed antipsychotics antagonize dopamine receptors, including 
haloperidol (Moe et al., 2011) and risperidone (Janssen et al., 1988). Both are used in TBI 
patients, often not for treatment of psychosis or agitation, but rather for their sedative effects 
(Stanislav, 1997). Some studies using D2 receptor antagonists have found treatment was 
associated with poorer outcomes, as was true in some trials of haloperidol and risperidone 
(Hoffman et al., 2008). In a recent case study, when risperidone was perscribed to a 69 year 
old male who sustained a TBI 5 months prior and had developed symptoms of aggression, 
development of Parkinson-like symptoms were reported (Kang and Kim, 2013). In a trial of 
haloperidol in experimental TBI, delayed motor recovery was observed (Feeney et al., 1982; 
Osier and Dixon

 Goldstein and Bullman, 2002). It is also worth acknowledging that TBI survivors prescribed 
amphetamine (AMPH) may take haloperidol to counteract the adverse effects of AMPH 
therapy (Feeney et al., 1982).
3. Norepinephrine
3.1 Overview
Norepinephrine (NE), also called noradrenaline, is the second catecholamine to be discussed 
in detail in this review. NE, like epinephrine (see Section 4), pays an important role in the 
fight or flight response. Indeed, both neurotransmitters bind to adrenergic receptors and 
share other important similarities; however, NE is better-studied in the context of TBI. NE is 
believed to play a role in TBI recovery and the neurobehavioral symptoms experienced by 
survivors (Mahesh et al., 2010). One study in cats found spikes in NE following TBI (Rosner 
et al., 1984) as depicted in Figure 2. Clinically, TBI survivors often receive NE therapy for 
its vasopressive effects and one study found that NE levels in the CSF and plasma were 
elevated in TBI survivors treated with NE as well as some individuals who did not receive 
therapeutic NE; interestingly, the spike in plasma levels was independent of whether or not 
the blood-brain-barrier remained intact (Mautes et al., 2001). In this study, no evidence of 
toxicity from NE therapy was reported, nor were there correlations between GCS and NE 
levels. Pre-clinical evidence suggests lower turnover of NE after experimental TBI in rats, 
measured as the ratio of 3-methoxy-4 hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) to NE (see Figure 2); 
these changes in MHPG were reported at the injury site as well as in the cerebral cortex both 
rostral and caudal to the site of impact (Levin et al., 1995). A later study used high-
performance liquid chromatography to determine the ratio of MHPG:NE and found that in 
most brain regions, levels restored to that of sham by 2 hours after experimental TBI (Dunn-
Meynell et al., 1998).
3.2 Agonists
Catecholamine agonists are often used after TBI to maintain CPP; one pediatric study found 
NE was more commonly administered to older pediatric patients (Di Gennaro et al., 2011). 
Another study examined 13 severe TBI patients, over half (n=8) of whom had symptoms 
leading to the prescription of NE therapy, which binds to alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2, 
and beta-3 receptors; analysis revealed that NE treatment within the first two days of TBI 
was associated with slower return to normal vasomotor reactivity (Haenggi et al., 2012). 
Moreover, adding dobutamine, which stimulates beta-1 receptors, to NE therapy failed to 
produce significant effects (Haenggi et al., 2012). A third study tested the effects of 
verapamil, which blocks voltage-dependent calcium channels, in combination with NE after 
FPI and found that combinatorial therapy resulted in a restoration of regional cerebral blood 
flow at the location of the injury and elsewhere in the cortex compared to untreated injured 
rats (Maeda et al., 2005).
Despite the beneficial effects of NE on CPP, there are some adverse effects associated with 
NE treatment including an increase in interleukin 6 after experimental TBI, beyond the spike 
due to the injury itself (Stover et al., 2003). Another potential consequence of NE therapy is 
an alteration in creatinine clearances (CrCl) both while NE treatment is being administered

 and following it’s discontinuation (Udy et al., 2010); it is hypothesized that these changes in 
CrCl may impact renal excretion of other drugs used to treat TBI and any existing comorbid 
conditions. Another study stimulated isolated platelets obtained from 36 healthy volunteers 
and 11 TBI patients categorized as being in critical condition. The research team found that 
NE infusion was less effective in TBI patients during the first week of injury; in the second 
week post-injury TBI patients’ platelets exhibited hyper-susceptibility to NE exposure which 
coincided with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and reduced saturation of blood within 
the jugular vein (Tschuor et al., 2008). The authors conclude that the differences observed 
over time in this study may be reflective of alterations in receptor levels over time (Tschuor 
et al., 2008). A clinical study tested the serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor 
milnacipran and found it reduced depression and improved cognitive function (Kanetani et 
al., 2003). Overall, there is a need for additional evidence surrounding the efficacy and 
safety of NE therapy after TBI.
3.3 Antagonists
In addition to the beta blockers described in Section 4 of this review, alpha blockers have 
also been tested in TBI. For example, in experimental TBI, pretreatment with prazosin, a 
blocker of post-synaptic α-1 adrenergic receptors, has been associated with increased 
hippocampal edema 1 day after injury; this study suggests that alpha-1-adrenoreceptor 
blockade after TBI produces deleterious effects (Dunn-Meynell et al., 1998). The authors of 
this study caution that blocking NE release may compound TBI pathology. Taken together, it 
suggests that the spike in endogenous NE after TBI may be protective (Dunn-Meynell et al., 
1998).
4. Epinephrine
4.1 Overview
Epinephrine (EPI), also called adrenaline, is a catecholamine produced by chromaffin cells 
within the adrenal medulla as well as in some neurons (von Bohlen und Halbach and 
Dermietzel, 2006). The presence of EPI within the brain is well-established (Beart, 1979; 
Gunne, 1962; Vogt, 1954), as is the ability of neural tissue to produce EPI (Ciaranello et al., 
1969; Hökfelt et al., 1973; Pohorecky et al., 1969). Relative to the other catecholamines 
discussed in this review, EPI is found in low concentration within the brain (Beart, 1979; 
Gunne, 1962). EPI is produced by methylation of NE by phenylethanolamine N-
methyltransferase (PNMT), an endogenous enzyme as depicted in Figure 1 (Pohorecky and 
Baliga, 1973); several drugs are known to inhibit this PNMT (Fuller et al., 1971; Sall and 
Grunewald, 1987), though the effect of these drugs in the context of TBI remains unknown. 
EPI is implicated in the fight or flight response (Peet et al., 2013) and is up-regulated when 
the CNS processes stressful stimuli. EPI is also believed to underlie the stress response 
observed in post-traumatic stress disorder, a common co-morbidity in TBI survivors (Toth et 
al., 2013). TBI is known to result in an acute spike in EPI levels as depicted in Figure 2 
(Lang et al., 2015; Rosner et al., 1984). Preclinical trials suggest strain-specific differences 
in PNMT exist. For example, in F344 rats activity of this enzyme is more than four times 
that in BUF rats; notably, in this study enzyme rates were inversely proportional to receptor 
density (Perry et al., 1983). In a publication studying clinical TBI, the authors reported a

 four-to-five-fold increase in EPI levels among TBI survivors with a GCS of 3–4; however, 
the same study found that TBI survivors with a GCS greater than 11 experienced either no 
spike or only a slight elevation (Hamill et al., 1987). In addition to TBI affecting the 
endogenous release of EPI, evidence suggests TBI impacts its metabolism of as well. 
Specifically, after pediatric TBI, epinehrine excretion in the form of urinary metanephrine 
(see Figure 2) increases when compared to healthy control and children diagnosed with 
ADHD (Konrad et al., 2003). The effect of this increased metabolism is yet to be fully 
determined including whether this has any pathophysiological consequences. Additional 
research characterizing post-TBI changes in EPI that occur after TBI is warranted, including 
studies trialing agonists and antagonists, as described in sections 4.2 and 4.3, respectively.
4.2 Agonists
Notably, EPI and the synthetic form, phenylephrine (a direct α-1 adrenergic agonist), is 
administered to TBI patients, not to target brain pathology, but rather because of its actions 
as a vasopressor. However, not all patients receiving a vasopressor are given EPI, as 
vasopressor selection depends on several factors. Moreover, published evidence suggests 
that EPI is often not the most common post-TBI pressor choice among prescribers. One 
study found that physians were more likely to prescribe EPI for their younger pediatric TBI 
patients, but tended to favor norepinephrine or phenylephrine for older pediatric patients (Di 
Gennaro et al., 2011). Compared to dopamine agonists, discussed in section 2.2, evidence is 
more limited rearding EPI agonists after TBI. It is notable that EPI has several clinical 
contraindications (e.g. sulfate sensitivity; diagnosis with closed-angle glaucoma) and several 
drugs that epinephrine is known to interact with (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, halogenated 
anesthetics, and beta blockers). Similarly, phenylephrine has known interactions with 
tricyclic antidepressants as well as monamine oxidase inhibitors. Also worth noting is that 
EPI binds to the majority of adrenergic receptors; thus, EPI may result in systemic effects 
more so than agonists specific to a more limited number of receptor subtypes, such as 
dopamine and norepinephrine, as discussed in section 2.2 and 3.2, respectively.
4.3 Antagonists
Relatively little is known regarding therapeutic applications of drugs that block the activity 
of EPI. Though not specific to EPI, beta-adrenergic blockade has been trialed after TBI with 
some success. For example, a large study of 2601 TBI patients, including 506 patients 
treated with beta blockers found that beta blocker users had substantially lower mortality 
compared to their untreated counterparts (Schroeppel et al., 2010); the authors conclude that 
beta blockers may be an inexpensive and safe way to prevent mortality after TBI. Another 
study found improved survival with beta blocker treatment after TBI (Cotton et al., 2007).
Beta blockers have also been used for symptomatic relief of TBI-related intestinal 
dysfunction and reduced permeability, two related symptoms associated with the surge of 
EPI seen in TBI. One study trialing the beta blocker labetalol in a rat model reported 
improved intestinal permeability after experimental TBI, along with reduced SNS 
hyperactivity as evidenced by plasma EPI levels at 3 acute and subacute timepoints (Lang et 
al., 2015). A systematic review study examined the use of beta-2 receptor antagonists after 
TBI and concluded that many of the published studies were limited by poor methodology

 and/or small sample size; however, overall the evidence suggests that beta-2 receptor 
blockade may reduce cerebral edema and lead to attenuation of TBI-induced functional 
deficits (Ker et al., 2009). Evidence from a study examining genetically modified mice 
lacking the β2-adrenergic receptor found that knockout mice had favorable outcomes after 
ischemia-induced brain injury (Han et al., 2009). Overall, evidence suggests adrenergic 
blockade after TBI may be beneficial, though additional research is needed.
5 Remaining Gaps and Future Research Directions
Both pre-clinical and clinical evidence suggest that targeting the catacholaminergic system 
after TBI may ameliorate cellular and functional dysfunction. Of the three main 
catecholamines (dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine) described in this review (see: 
sections 2, 3, and 4, respectively), DA is the most extensively studied and has the most 
promising evidence to date. There are several phase I and phase II clinical trials indicating 
the benifical effects of targeting dopamine. Still, there is limited evidence surrounding the 
beneficial role epinephrine and norepinephrine can play post TBI.
Additional evidence is needed regarding therapeutic targeting of catecholamines after TBI. 
Studies are strengthened by inclusion of both acute and chronic timepoints. Similarly, rigor 
and thoughtful study design are important in generating high-quality evidence surrounding 
the roles of catecholamine agonists and antagonists, as well as drugs that target 
catecholamines indirectly. For example, care should be given to selection of the treatment 
regimens (e.g. dosage, timing, duration, route) based on available literature, known drug 
properties, and any patient contraindications; this will be relevant to the quest to successfully 
translate novel TBI therapeutics to the bedside. Part of this effort should include further 
examination of combination therapy, for example, simultaneous targeting of D1 and D2 
receptors.
There are several barriers to developing and testing novel TBI therapeutics. TBI is clinically 
complex and includes diverse pathophysiological processes including inflammation, cell 
death, excitotoxicity, and multiple changes to catecholamines, to name a few. Thus, the 
development of drugs will be complex and require transdisciplinary collaboration. Further, 
there are several known factors complicating translation of catecholaminergic and other 
therapies to TBI care (Tolias and Bullock, 2004), including confounding effects of genetic 
variability (Yue et al., 2015), polytrauma in human TBI patients (Capone-Neto and Rizoli, 
2009; Ladanyi and Elliott, 2008), drug reactions (Muir, 2006), and issues related to breaches 
in the blood–brain barrier (Folkersma et al., 2009; Whalen et al., 1998).
There are also additional challenges to targeting catecholamines specifically. For example, 
because of the shared production pathway of DA, NE, and EPI (see Figure 1), drugs 
targeting this pathway by blocking tyrosine hydroxylation or L-DOPA decarboxylation, will 
be non-specific and lower endogenous DA, NE, and EPI (Fuller, 1982). Similarly, drugs 
targeting DA β-hydroxylation will lower endogenous NE and EPI. Only PNMT inhibition 
would be specific to lowering EPI, by stopping methylation of NE to EPI. Administering 
exogenous catecholamines is complicated by the fact that many of the catecholamines bind 
to several receptor subtypes; for example, α-1 and β-1 receptors bind to DA, NE, and EPI, 
Osier and Dixon

 while α-2 respond to NE and EPI, and β-2 respond to EPI specifically. Additionally, there is 
the potential for systemic (therapeutic and adverse) effects of treatment due to the fact that 
catecholaminergic receptor subtypes are found throughout the body. For example, α-1 
receptors are located in vasculature, bladder, and eyes; α-2 receptors are found within pre-
synaptic nerve terminals; and β-1 receptors are located in the heart and kidneys. Overall, 
targeting the catecholaminergic system represents a complex, but potentially beneficial 
therapeutic avenue to promote TBI recovery.
Replication of promising experimental findings and expansion of the work to other models 
and eventually human trials will be facilitated by thorough dissemination of study findings; 
this includes detailed reporting of important experimental endpoints in research publications 
and presentations, as outlined in the recently published 2nd version of the National Institute 
of Neurological Diseases and Stroke’s Common Data Elements for TBI research (National 
Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke, 2015; Smith et al., 2015). To promote clinical 
relevance and translatability, personal and genetic characteristics that may affect response to 
therapies targeting the catacholamines should be considered; when possible, stratified 
analysis by genotype or control for genetic variation should be used (Wagner et al., 2007). 
For example, because sex differences in TBI outcomes have been reported, sex is an 
important factor to consider when trialing DA therapies (Ratcliff et al., 2007; Slewa-Younan 
et al., 2004). Indeed, sex-specific differences in outcome have been reported (Wagner et al., 
2007). Similarly, genetic variation and differential expression in DAT and other DA-, NE-, 
and EPI- related genes including the enzymes responsible for synthesis and metabolism of 
these compounds may be relevant when trialing novel therapies for effectiveness and adverse 
effects (Failla et al., 2013; Zhuang et al., 2001). There is known genetic variation in the 
catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) gene which encodes an enzyme responsible for 
degrading catecholamines; clinically, variation in COMT has been associated with cognitive 
impairment after mild TBI (Yue et al., 2015); variation in other genes related to 
pharmacogenomic response (e.g. CYP2C9; VKORC1) should also be explored. 
Understanding the role of molecular genetic and genomic factors may be relevant in the 
quest to successfully translate catecholamine-targeting drugs to TBI clinical care. 
Furthermore, gene-gene and gene-environment interactions should be considered, including 
the effects of environmental enrichment (experimental rehabilitation) on catecholamines and 
outcomes of brain injury (Shin et al., 2013; Wagner et al., 2005a).
6 Conclusion
Existing evidence suggests that TBI pathology results in several changes to the 
catecholamine system including downregulation of D2 receptors, upregulation of D1 
receptors, and spikes in EPI, NE, and DA levels as depicted in Figure 2. Subsequently, 
researchers have tested several drugs targeting catecholamines directly or indirectly using 
pre-clinical models and clinical trials as described throughout this review and summarized in 
Table 1. For example, indirect and direct targeting of DA after TBI has been associated with 
beneficial effects on memory, learning, executive function, and other aspects of cognition 
(Armstead et al., 2013). Notably, evidence is more limited regarding the role of epinephrine 
agonists, NE agonists (Forsyth and Jayamoni, 2003), and monoamine agonists more broadly 
(Forsyth et al., 2006). Overall, additional evidence is needed regarding how to best target the

 catecholaminergic system to improve outcomes of TBI. Pre-clinical studies are useful in 
exploring cellular targets of drugs and providing preliminary evidence regarding the safety 
and efficacy of catecholamine-targeting drugs for improving functional outcomes. 
Additional clinical evidence is especially needed to confirm safety and of these drugs for 
treating human TBI and ultimately translate these therapies to clinical care.

 Figure 1. Production of Dopamine (DA), Norepinephrine (NE), and Epinephrine (EPI)
The amino acid L-tyrosine is hydroxylated to form L-dihydroxyphenyalanine (L-DOPA), 
which is decarboxylated into DA, which goes on to be β-hydroxylated into NE, and finally 
methylated to form EPI.

 Figure 2. Key changes to catecholamine systems after TBI
This figure highlights several notable changes within the three major catecholamine 
neurotransmitters discussed in this review: DA, NE, and EPI. In the figure, up arrow denotes 
an increase and down arrow denotes a decrease; bold arrows denote chronic changes and 
non-bold arrows denote acute changes. Notable changes to the DAergic system after TBI 
include acute spike in DA, chronic depletion of DA, acute increase in D1-like receptors, 
chronic decreases in D2-like receptors, chronic increase in tyrosine hydroxylatse (TH), and 
chronic decrease in dopamine trasporter (DAT) function. Changes to the NE system after 
TBI include acute spikes in NE levels and decreased turnover of NE to 3-methoxy-4 
hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG). Post-TBI changes to the epinephrine system include an 
acute spike in epinephrine levels and decreased excretion as urinary metanephrine.

mechanism of action/target receptor(s), study subjects, doses tested, and outcomes are included.
Agent Name
Mechanism/Target
Study Subjects
Doses Tested
Outcomes
Reference
Amantadine
Increases DA release; blocks 
DA reuptake. Binds NMDA 
receptor
Patients with severe TBI 
(N=74) divided into treated 
and untreated groups
Standard therapy + 200 mg 
amantadine administered 
intravenously twice daily for 3 days, 
starting 3 days after initial 
hospitalization
In the group of patients with severe brain 
injuries treated with standard therapy plus 
amantadine the outcome GCS was higher and 
the case fatality rate lower than in the group 
treated with standard therapy alone.
Saniova, et al., 
2004
Patients with severe TBI 
(N=184) treated with 
amantadine (N=87) or placebo 
(N=97)
100mg of amantadine for 2 weeks (vs. 
placebo) which was increased to 
150mg week 3 and 200mg week 4
Amantadine accelerates recovery as assessed 
using the disability rating scale in patients 
with severe TBI.
Giacino, et al., 
2012
2 individuals recovering from 
TBI who were experiencing 
behavioral problems that were 
difficult to treat
Amantadine therapy as part of TBI 
management
Amantadine treatment reduced symptoms of 
agitation and aggression.
Chandler, et al., 
1988
168 TBI patients (6+ months 
post-injury) divided into 
amantadine (N=82) or placebo 
(N=86)
100 mg of amantadine given twice 
daily over a 60-day treatment course
TBI survivors and clinicians reported lower 
irritability at the 60 day follow-up assessment.
Hammond, et al., 
2015
Male Sprague-Dawley rats 
(N=42) exposed to CCI or 
sham
Daily treatment with 10 mg/kg 
amantadine (vs. placebo) administered 
for 18 days
Amantadine did not promote motor recovery 
or hippocampal neuron survival; amantadine 
modestly improved MWM performance
Dixon, et al., 
1999
Rats (N=130) exposed to FPI 
or sham

Chronic subcutaneous infusion with 
3.6mg/kg/day of amantadine or saline

Pramipexole
DA Agonist at D2, D3, and D4
Children and adolescents 
(N=25) experiencing a low-
level of responsiveness at least 
1 month after TBI
Treated with pramipexole or 
amantadine with a dosage that was 
based on age and increased over 4 
weeks and then weaned for the next 2 
weeks
Amantadine and pramipexole were similarly 
effective without significant side effects. Both 
dopamine agonists supported restoration 
arousal, awareness, and communication. The 
authors conclude that both DA agonists 
accelerated rehabilitation after brain injury, 
warranting additional study

Adult male rats exposed to 
CCI or sham (N=73 across 2 
experiments with group sizes 
of 10–17)
5 mg/kg intraperitoneal bromocriptine 
(vs. vehicle) starting 24 hr post-injury, 
with continued daily injections
Bromocriptine treatment following 
experimental TBI enhanced working and 
spatial memory assessed via MWM. CCI+ 
bromocriptine was associated with more 
morphologically intact CA3 neurons than the 
injured vehicle-treated group
Kline, et al., 
2002
24 TBI survivors at least 4 
weeks post-injury at time of 
testing
2.5 mg bromocriptine (vs. placebo) in 
crossover study
Bromocriptine improved executive function 
and duel-task performance; other assessments 
of cognitive function showed no effect of 
treatment
McDowell, et al., 
1998
26 mild TBI survivors (1 
month post-injury) + 31 
healthy controls
1.25 mg oral bromocriptine (vs. 
placebo)
Among healthy controls, bromocriptine led to 
better memory performance; TBI survivors 
were not responsive.

Methamphetamin e
Stimulant that agonizes several 
receptors including trace amine-
associated receptor 1 and 
alpha-2
Adult male Wistar rats (N=34) 
exposed to severe TBI 
modeled using lateral FPI (vs. 
sham)
Intravenous bolus 0.845mg/kg of 
methamphetamine (vs. saline) given 3 
hours post-injury followed by 
continuous intravenous infusion 6.7 
microliters/hour
Low-dose methamphetamine treatment 
reduced behavioral and cognitive 
consequences of TBI as assessed using 
neurological severity score, the foot fault test, 
and MWM. Methamphetamine treatment was 
also associated with reduced apoptotic cell 
death and an increase in immature neurons.
Rau et al., 2012
Adult male CD1 mice (N=88) 
exposed to mild TBI modeled 
using temporal weight drop 
injury (vs. sham) broken into 
subgroups based on sacrifice 
time point
5 mg/kg methamphetamine (vs. 
saline) administered intraperitoneally 
30 min prior to injury
In this study administration of low-dose 
methamphetamine exacerbated the deficits in 
dopamine turnover occurring after 
experimental brain injury. Suppression of 
locomotor response was also worsened 
following treatment as assessed using 
locomotor activity chambers for up to 72 
hours.

Lisuride
DA agonist binds D2, D3, and 
D4 (among other receptors)
Male Sprague-Dawley rats 
(N=70) exposed to TBI 
modeled using TBI (vs. sham)
0.3 mg/kg loading dose followed by 
0.5 mg/kg/day maintenance doses 
lisuride (vs. placebo) administered via 
subcutaneous implanted osmotic 
pumps for the study duration (7 days)
Lisuride reduced the number of post-TBI 
seizures and the seizures that did occur were 
shorter than those in untreated animals. The 
loading dose lowered blood pressure but the 
contusion volumes and behavioral 
performance did not differ across the groups.

Methylphenidate
DA & NE reuptake inhibitor; 
binds and blocks DA and NE 
transporters
15 TBI patients who received 
methylphenidate as part of a 
double-blind, controlled, 
crossover trial
Methylphenidate treatment continued 
in the patients for a year
Methylphenidate led to modest improvement 
of some symptoms was reported although the 
crossover design led to some carryover 
effects.

38 adult males who had 
experienced TBI and were 
beyond the rapid recovery 
period in a single-bind pre-
test/post-test placebo-
controlled trial
Subjects received methylphenidate (30 
mg/day) or placebo for a 6 week 
treatment period
Methylphenidate was well-tolerated and a 
significant drug/time interaction effect was 
reported; less impairment on general 
psychopathology and memory tests was also 
reported, though other measures (e.g. 
attention) were unchanged.

12 closed head injury patients 
assessed 14+ months post-
injury in a double-blind 
placebo-controlled, crossover 
trial
Methylphenidate (0.3 mg/kg)

N=6 TBI patients examined 
before, during, and after 
methylphenidate therapy
Methylphenidate treatment with 
dosage increasing over 2 weeks (5–
10mg) followed and then reduced over 
an additional 2 weeks
A visual spatial attention task revealed that 
TBI patients had relatively worse performance 
on leftward hemifield shifts (vs. right) and 
that the difference in left and right 
performance was ameliorated by 
methylphenidate.
Pavlovskaya et

30 mild-to-moderate TBI 
patients randomized to 3 
treatment groups (n=10/group)
Methylphenidate starting at 5 mg/day, 
and increasing to 20mg/kg in a week 
vs. placebo. *Note also tested 
sertraline (included later in this table) 
@2 5mg/day then 100 mg/day at 1 
week)
Methylphenidate reduced depressive 
symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, and 
daytime sleepiness after TBI without 
otherwise altering recovery. *Sertraline 
reduced depressive symptoms only. 
Methylphenidate was better tolerated.

23 patients with mild to severe 
TBI in a doubleblind, 
randomized, placebo-
controlled trial
Treatment with methylphenidate (30 
mg/kg) or placebo starting the day 
after baseline assessment and for 30 
days thereafter
Methylphenidate enhanced the rate but not the 
overall extent of recovery as assessed using 
the Disability Rating Scale and assessments of 
vigilance.

Male Sprague-Dawley (N=24) 
rats exposed to CCI (vs. sham)
Methylphenidate (5 mg/kg) or vehicle

Methylphenidate did not improve motor 
recovery as assessed using the beam balance 
or beam walking task, but it did improve 
learning on the MWM.

Methylphenidate (0.3 mg/kg twice 
daily); 24.4 mg (range, 15–40); one 
day washout before crossover
Beneficial effects were found on 5 of the 13 
attentional factors 3 of which were significant

Prazosin (3 mg/kg) or the NE-
reuptake blocker 
desmethylimipramine (10 mg/kg) vs. 
vehicle administered intraperitoneally 
30 minutes prior to TBI
Pre-treatment with prazosin resulted in edema

conclude that the increase in NE after TBI 
plays an important role and that blocking this 
can be detrimental.

There was a higher survival with beta blocker 
treatment, which is especially notable since 
the group receiving beta blockers was older, 
and older TBI patients usually have higher
