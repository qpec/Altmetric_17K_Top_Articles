Abstract
Objectives Antimicrobial review is an important part of antimicrobial steward-
ship. A novel enzyme template generation and amplification technique (ETGA),
the Cognitor� Minus (Momentum Bioscience, Long Hanborough, UK) test,
has a 99.5% negative predictive value for bacteraemia and fungaemia. This
observational study asked two questions: (1) Does a negative ETGA, indicating
no bacteraemia or fungaemia, aid antimicrobial review within 48 h of admis-
sion; (2) In this real-life clinical setting, does a negative ETGA mean no bacter-
aemia or fungaemia?
Methods Consecutive blood cultures in patients with clinical infection were
tested by ETGA. Negative results indicating an absence of bacteraemia or fun-
gaemia were reviewed by the clinical infection team. Antibiotics were reviewed
in these patients, and the role of the ETGA result in antibiotic change was
recorded. Patients were followed up for a week.
Key findings A total of 197 of 246 samples gave a negative result by ETGA.
This led to a positive stewardship outcome (antimicrobials changed) in 145
(73.6%) and negative stewardship outcome (empirical antimicrobials contin-
ued) in 47 (23.9%). Of the positive stewardship outcomes, the ETGA result
supported the decision not to start antimicrobials in 21 (10.7%) patients, to
stop antimicrobials in 21 (10.7%), to switch from IV to oral antimicrobials in
103 (52.2%) or to discharge or leave the patient at home in 58 cases (29.4%).
Conclusions Enzyme template generation and amplification supports antimi-
crobial stewardship decisions and may have cost advantages in reducing unnec-
essary empirical antibiotics and antifungal agents and in discharging patients
from hospital earlier. ETGA result was consistent with blood culture findings
and gave an earlier negative result.
Introduction
Antimicrobial stewardship is an essential part of clinical
care to reduce selection pressure on bacteria and reduce
antibiotic-associated complications.[1] As such, it has
become an important quality standard in health care, par-
ticularly in the UK.[2] Approximately 10% of blood culture
samples submitted for microbiological testing are found to
be positive. The remaining 90% of samples are generally
reported as negative after 5 days of incubation,[3] during
which time clinicians may continue to prescribe broad-
spectrum antibiotics to the patient with suspected bacterial
infection. In addition, many patients with possible infec-
tion, for example neonates following complex deliveries,
oncology patients with fever, elderly patients with deterio-
ration who are admitted to medical assessment units and

 deteriorating patients on intensive care units (ICU), are
treated empirically with intravenous antimicrobials and
often for prolonged periods. This overuse of antimicrobials
leads to increased pharmacy and clinical costs, the promo-
tion of antimicrobial resistance and an increased risk of
antimicrobial-associated disease.
Enzymatic
template
generation
and
amplification
(ETGA) (Cognitor� Minus; Momentum Bioscience, Long
Hanborough, Oxfordshire, UK) is a novel technology for
the universal and rapid phenotypic detection of viable
micro-organisms by detecting the presence of bacterial or
fungal nucleic acid-modifying enzymes such as DNA
polymerase.[4,5] This technology has been applied to
blood culture using the ETGA in vitro diagnostic test. The
ETGA test has been validated and CE-marked, and it has
a very high negative predictive value (NPV) for bacter-
aemia.[4,5] This previous study demonstrated a 99.5%
NPV on blood culture sets measured after >12-h incuba-
tion in the bioMerieux BacT/ALERT� blood culture sys-
tem, when compared with the result after 5 days. Its use
in a routine clinical microbiology laboratory can deter-
mine patients who are not bacteraemic at a very early
stage. Early detection of the presence or absence of bacte-
ria or fungi in blood may help earlier review of empirical
antimicrobial use and support antimicrobial stewardship
programmes.
The ETGA test detects living organisms by separating
intact (viable) organisms from the specimen and neutral-
ising background levels of enzyme activity. Following
microbial lysis, DNA polymerase activity is then detected
using a proprietary synthetic DNA substrate that can be
modified by DNA polymerase. ETGA can be used to uni-
versally detect any micro-organism because DNA poly-
merase activity is common to all living things. ETGA
does not identify micro-organisms and does not detect
microbial or human DNA or RNA. The amount of
modified ETGA substrate is indicative of microbial DNA
polymerase activity and can be measured by quantitative/
real-time PCR (qPCR). The assay has been validated for
clinical use on the Cepheid Smartcycler.
This study assessed the clinical application of a vali-
dated diagnostic test using ETGA technology for the rapid
confirmation and exclusion of negative blood culture
specimens. The aim was to see whether early determina-
tion of negative bacteraemia and fungaemia allowed
earlier antimicrobial review.
Methods
Subjects and setting
The study was carried out at two main hospital sites (the
Royal Hampshire County Hospital, Winchester and the
North
Hampshire
Hospital,
Basingstoke)
within
the
Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust between
December 2015 and May 2016. Patients with clinical
infection who had blood cultures collected were included.
This was an observational study which asked two ques-
tions: (1) Does a negative ETGA, indicating no bacter-
aemia or fungaemia, aid antimicrobial review within 48 h
of admission; (2) In this real-life clinical setting, does a
negative ETGA mean no bacteraemia or fungaemia?
Laboratory procedures
Blood was cultured and tested by ETGA (Cognitor�
Minus; Momentum Bioscience) from both the aerobic
and anaerobic adult blood culture bottle (0.5 ml from
each bottle), or from a paediatric blood culture bottle
(1 ml), sent routinely to the microbiology laboratory.
Samples were taken from blood culture bottles incubated
on a blood culture machine (BacT/ALERT�, BioMerieux,
Basingstoke, UK) for at least 12 h and that were negative
at the time of sample collection. Briefly, in a Class II bio-
safety cabinet, the relevant volume of blood was with-
drawn from the bottle and immediately placed in the
ETGA sample tube. The tube was labelled with a working
number which was linked to the laboratory identification
number on the study worksheet. All blood culture bottles
were returned to the incubator. The sampling step took
no longer than 10 min. The sample was then processed in
accordance with the ETGA information for use.[6]
Blood cultures which had signalled positive, indicating
bacteraemia or fungaemia, were excluded. Prior to the
main evaluation starting, a study was carried out to deter-
mine any risk of contamination by the sampling manipu-
lation. Seventy consecutive blood culture bottles had
samples extracted. Terminal culture was performed. No
contamination was detected.
In practical terms to follow the routine working pattern
of a clinical laboratory, the evaluation required extracting
the sample from the blood culture bottle the morning
after the blood culture had been received in the labora-
tory. Sequential samples were chosen with no other selec-
tion procedure. Culture of the blood continued even
though a sample was removed for ETGA testing.
Negative ETGA results were interpreted as negative for
bacteraemia and fungaemia. If the ETGA test gave a Ct
value of ≤43.5, this indicated that the blood culture was
not negative and the result was reported as ‘Not Deter-
mined’. The interpretation of such results in blood cul-
tures which had so far shown no growth signal could
mean that the microbes were in a growing phase and
would signal positive at a later time, that the blood cul-
ture contained a non-culturable microbe or that it was a
false positive.

ETGA to aid antimicrobial stewardship
 Antimicrobial stewardship methods
Intervention
Enzyme template generation and amplification results
were communicated by the laboratory to the clinical
microbiology infection teams delivering patient consults
at the two hospitals. The clinical microbiology teams con-
sist of specialists and trainees in microbiology/infectious
disease and antimicrobial pharmacists. The patients with
negative ETGA results were clinically reviewed, and a
clinical assessment was made on the contribution of the
negative bacteraemia result to antimicrobial review at
12–24 h after commencing antimicrobials.
Outcomes and outcome measures
The clinical review was of history, examination, assess-
ment of signs of sepsis, focus of infection, with investiga-
tions.
Using
criteria
in
antimicrobial
stewardship
protocols for antimicrobial review,[1,2] along with the
ETGA result, the empirical antimicrobials were reviewed
and decisions regarding antimicrobial changes were made
by the clinical infection team reviewing the patient. The
contribution of the ETGA result to the antimicrobial
review was classified as ‘positive’ (empirical antimicrobials
were changed or not started) or ‘negative’ (empirical
antimicrobials were continued), and, if positive, whether
antimicrobials discontinued or de-escalated.
Patients were followed up by ward visits or telephone
for a minimum of 5 days following antimicrobial review
to determine the outcome of the review. The purpose of
the follow-up was for clinical review of the episode of
infection and to ensure that there was no relapse or dete-
rioration of the presenting infection.
Data management and analysis
The clinical review data were recorded on a spreadsheet,
and as this was an observational evaluation, the data were
not subjected to detailed statistical analysis. The organisa-
tion’s research and development department reviewed the
protocol of the evaluation. Ethical approval was not
required as the blood cultures were collected routinely.
No additional samples were collected or tested. The blood
culture was tested by two validated licensed techniques –
culture on the automated BacT/ALERT� system and Cog-
nitor� Minus. As the latter was a validated and CE-
marked diagnostic method, it was appropriate for the
result of this test to contribute to clinical decisions in the
same way that inflammatory markers or bacteriology
results might be used to form an opinion of the most
appropriate therapeutic choice.
Results
A total of 246 blood culture samples were tested by
ETGA. The positive and negative controls run on each
batch, gave expected results. One hundred and ninety-
seven (80%) samples gave a negative ETGA result and
interpreted as true-negative blood cultures. These were
the patients who were followed up to see whether the
result influenced antimicrobial decisions.
Of the 49 ‘Not Determined’ results, seven samples grew
various microbes on culture. These were clear true posi-
tives. Forty-two were negative by blood culture. It was
not the remit of this study to establish why the ETGA
and blood culture results were discrepant, but as these
samples could not be called true negatives, they were
excluded from the antimicrobial analysis.
There were two samples that were ETGA negative but
grew bacteria. One grew a coagulase-negative staphylococ-
cus at day 5, this was regarded as a contaminant which
may not have been present in the blood culture when the
sample was removed for ETGA testing. One grew an
anaerobic coccus on day 4. This organism failed to grow
on subculture and was not identified. The focus was
thought to be an intra-abdominal source in an elderly
patient with diverticulitis. This demonstrated that a nega-
tive EDTA equated to negative bacteraemia and fun-
gaemia with a NPV of 99.5%, consistent with validation
studies.[4,5]
The suspected clinical focus of infection for the 197
patients followed up with consults is given in Table 1.
One hundred and seventy-five (88.8%) patients were on
antimicrobials at the 24-h consult which meant that the
remaining 22 patients had not been started on empirical
antimicrobials even though blood cultures had been
taken.
There were many reasons why patients had had blood
cultures collected but had not been started on empirical
antimicrobials and this varied by focus. The clinical diag-
nosis was often not clear, and antimicrobials were with-
held because the patient was not septic, but blood
cultures
had
been
collected.
For
example,
in
the
intra-abdominal category, antimicrobials had not been
commenced in patients with pancreatitis, abdominal pain
possible appendicitis or diverticulitis; in the central ner-
vous system category because the infection was likely to
be viral; in the chest category because there was suspected
aspiration
pneumonitis,
viral
infection,
pulmonary
oedema or the patient was unresponsive but not septic; in
the unknown category because the patient had myeloma,
lymphoma, neutropaenia, EBV or long vascular catheter
in situ. It was regarded as a positive stewardship outcome
(Table 1) if the ETGA result supported a decision not to

 start antimicrobials in a patient who had not received
empirical antimicrobials.
The ETGA result had a positive stewardship outcome
in 145 of 197 (73.6%) and negative stewardship outcome
in 47 (23.9%). In the latter case, this meant that the
empirical intravenous antimicrobials were continued as
prescribed, despite the patient not being bacteraemic, and
this decision was made on clinical grounds. Of the posi-
tive stewardship outcomes, the ETGA result supported
the decision not to start antimicrobials in 21 (10.7%)
patients, to stop antimicrobials in 21 (10.7%), to switch
from IV to oral antimicrobials in 103 (52.2%) or to dis-
charge or leave the patient at home in 58 cases (29.4%).
Example #1
Mrs JR, 78, admitted from home to medical emergency
unit, confused, fall. Cough and offensive urine. Tempera-
ture 37.8. Bi-basal crackles in chest examination. Blood
pressure 170/85, Heart rate 88, WBC 9.8 9 106/l, blood
cultures taken on admission. Commenced on intravenous
piperacillin/tazobactam to cover chest and urinary sepsis.
Following day
Normal temperature, other observations stable. ETGA
confirmed no bacteraemia on day 1. On post-take review
ETGA result supported de-escalation of antibiotics from
IV
piperacillin/tazobactam
to
oral
cotrimoxazole
for
3 days and discharge on day 3. End patient diagnosis was
chest infection.
The benefits of ETGA in this case resulted in reduction
in intravenous antimicrobials, staffing costs and earlier
discharge, as well as the benefits of improved antimicro-
bial stewardship, lower antimicrobial selection pressure
and improved patient management.
Example #2
Mr MC, 58, Intensive care, postoperative patient follow-
ing abdominal surgery for carcinoma of the colon. Unsta-
ble postoperatively with higher oxygen and ionotropic
requirements, and some renal derangement. Concern that
physiological derangement represented early sepsis. Pro-
phylactic
antibiotics
of
amoxicillin,
gentamicin
and
metronidazole
were
continued.
Blood
cultures
were
collected.
Following day
Physiological derangement improving. Procalcitonin and
white cell count were within normal limits. ETGA con-
firmed no bacteraemia on day 1. ETGA results with the
clinical assessment and inflammatory markers supported
stopping antibiotics.
Enzymatic template generation and amplification result
supported a reduction in intravenous antibiotics, with the
benefits of improved antimicrobial stewardship, lower
antibiotic selection pressure and improved patient man-
agement.
In the follow-up of patients, no patient required
restarting or escalation of antimicrobials when a decision
had been made not to start, to stop or to switch from IV
to oral. None of the 58 patients discharged were readmit-
ted in the follow-up period.
Discussion
This study demonstrates that the ETGA test can be used
to complement other laboratory parameters, to aid clini-
cal review of antimicrobials in patient in hospital. A nega-
tive ETGA test with its high NPV equates to mean
negative bacteraemia or fungaemia, and this information

ETGA to aid antimicrobial stewardship
 delivered at an early stage is helpful in the management
of anti-infective therapy. The ETGA result supports early
antimicrobial review and equated to a true-negative
bacteraemia and fungaemia.
The strength of this study is in having an additional
laboratory test, based on microbiological criteria, to com-
plement physiological measurements to support therapeu-
tic decision making. This is the first time that this use of
this novel diagnostic technology has been reported in a
real-life clinical environment. The limitations of this study
are that the antimicrobial review decisions, although
based on published principles of antimicrobial steward-
ship, are nevertheless subjective clinical decisions of the
individual clinician reviewing the patient and this is not a
randomised controlled trial. However, by including two
sites and a number of clinicians in the decision process,
variations in individual practice and risk assessment were
levelled out. There was no control group in this study,
but as antimicrobial review is a subjective process anyway,
it would be difficult to construct a randomised controlled
to measure the effect of a laboratory test on antibiotic
decision making. The ETGA test result was used as an
additional piece of objective information, to complement
all the other objective test results to make what is a sub-
jective decision. A number of patients had a negative
ETGA test but had a focal infection such as soft tissue
infection or respiratory infection. These patients needed
to continue antimicrobials, but often did not need intra-
venous antimicrobials.
Blood cultures are generally collected because a patient
is clinically septic, has a fever, has deteriorated or to
exclude bacteraemia.[3] Patients with sepsis or suspected
infection are usually treated with antimicrobials empiri-
cally. Although most blood cultures signal positive in the
first 24–48 h, they are not reported as negative until
5 days of incubation is completed. While early antibiotics
save lives, empirical treatment results in much overuse of
antimicrobials and, if bacteraemia can be excluded, early
antimicrobials may be discontinued or de-escalated early
(see patient examples above). We previously reported the
use of a biomarker procalcitonin (PCT) to aid the deci-
sion to start or withhold antimicrobials in patients with
suspected infection in the medical assessment unit or
ICU.[7] With a careful clinical assessment, we found the
PCT result to be helpful in this decision. Our aim in this
study was to see whether an additional objective test
would
help
with
antimicrobial
prescribing
decisions.
ETGA, with a high NPV, fulfilled the criteria for a test
that could exclude bacteraemia, and therefore most seri-
ous acute infection, early.
Clinical decisions made by doctors are made by analysis
of a range of data streams: history, clinical examination,
vital signs, radiology, laboratory tests, but are of necessity
often empirical and subjective. Early confirmation of
exclusion of bacteraemia is very useful. Patients who are
clearly septic on clinical grounds will be treated appropri-
ately. Patients with clear focal infection will be treated
appropriately according to local guidelines for that focus.
However, there are many patients who do not fall into
clear categories and many of these patients receive antimi-
crobials unnecessarily and for too long. Exclusion of bac-
teraemia/fungaemia in such patients, with supportive
biomarkers can provide useful reassurance to stop or
avoid starting empirical antimicrobials. Such patients
include some neonates and other paediatric patients,[8]
oncology and haematology patients with fever, elderly
patients with deterioration who are admitted to medical
assessment units and deteriorating patients on critical care
units. There is such emphasis now on improving the
quality
of
antimicrobial
prescribing
throughout
the
world[1,2,9] and indeed, in the United Kingdom, there are
now targets in the National Health Service to achieve
this.[10]
In this study, the blood cultures chosen for testing
with ETGA were sequential and not preselected. As a
routine diagnostic tool, it may be best to employ the
ETGA selectively. All patients put on empirical antibi-
otics or antifungals as a precaution, for example neo-
nates with complications, oncology patients with fever,
haematology patients with fever, deteriorating critical
care patients should have blood cultures tested with
ETGA. If negative, bacteraemia and fungaemia are highly
unlikely and antimicrobials can be reviewed, discontin-
ued or de-escalated. Other patients selected by clinical
review during the routine ward rounds could also be
added to the list of ETGA tests if bacteraemia or fun-
gaemia was part of the differential diagnosis but that
diagnosis was unclear.
Enzymatic template generation and amplification is an
effective and objective tool to aid the early review of
empirical antibiotics and antifungals. It can lead to earlier
reporting of confirmed negative blood cultures and pro-
vide additional information for recommending cessation
or modification of antimicrobial therapy in patients at
unclear risk of infection. This supports antimicrobial
stewardship by: allowing early review of empirical antimi-
crobials, allowing discontinuation, de-escalation or IV to
oral switch or oral antimicrobials, allow a step down in
patient care or hospital discharge, reduce antibiotic-asso-
ciated disease or reduce overall healthcare costs by reduc-
ing
antimicrobial
prescribing.
ETGA
may
have
cost
advantages in reducing unnecessary empirical antimicro-
bials and antifungal agents and in discharging patients
from hospital earlier. This was not formally assessed in
this study and requires a health economic analysis to
establish cost advantages for the use of ETGA.

 Conclusions
This is the first report of ETGA, a novel diagnostic tech-
nique, being used in a routine clinical environment to
demonstrate the absence of bacteraemia or fungaemia at
an early stage in the patients’ clinical care, and using the
result alongside other laboratory parameters to support a
clinical review of antimicrobial use. This observational
study concludes that ETGA is a useful tool in antimicro-
bial stewardship.

ETGA to aid antimicrobial stewardship
