Centipedes can subdue giant prey by using venom, which is metabol-
ically expensive to synthesize and thus used frugally through
efficiently disrupting essential physiological systems. Here, we show
that a centipede (Scolopendra subspinipes mutilans, ∼3 g) can sub-
due a mouse (∼45 g) within 30 seconds. We found that this obser-
vation is largely due to a peptide toxin in the venom, SsTx, and
further established that SsTx blocks KCNQ potassium channels to
exert the lethal toxicity. We also demonstrated that a KCNQ opener,
retigabine, neutralizes the toxicity of a centipede’s venom. The
study indicates that centipedes’ venom has evolved to simulta-
neously disrupt cardiovascular, respiratory, muscular, and nervous
systems by targeting the broadly distributed KCNQ channels, thus
providing a therapeutic strategy for centipede envenomation.
centipede | toxicity | SsTx | KCNQ
P
redators usually catch prey that are smaller than themselves
because capture success is a function of relative prey/preda-
tor size. It declines as the ratio increases (1, 2), but there is an-
ecdotal evidence that centipedes subdue prey much larger than
themselves by means of venoms (3, 4). Venomous predators use
potent venom to immobilize large prey as well as defend against
predators (5). However, venom is metabolically expensive to
synthesize. For example, the metabolic rate of snakes increased by
an average of 11% during a 3-d study over which venom re-
generation was measured (6). Thus, venoms are used frugally by
effectively targeting essential physiological systems, such as ner-
vous, respiratory, circulatory, and muscular systems, to ensure
successful capture of prey (2, 7).
Snake venoms target circulatory or nervous systems to effec-
tively capture prey (7), while spiders, scorpions, and snails often
immobilize prey by using venoms that act on the nervous system
(8, 9). Although some insights may be gleaned from recent work
on centipede toxins (10–13), the underlying mechanism of how
centipedes capture giant prey remains unknown.
Centipede envenomations occur frequently. In Hawaii, centi-
pede bites were responsible for 11% of the cases that presented
to hospital emergency departments from 2007 to 2011 (14). Se-
vere clinical symptoms, such as vasospasm, acute hypertension,
myocardial ischemia, and even death, have been observed fol-
lowing centipede envenomation (15–18). These symptoms point
to cardiovascular disorders, and based on our knowledge of
scorpion and spider toxins, ion channels are the likely targets.
We screened centipede venom against various ion channels and
found that a peptide toxin, SsTx, is extremely potent on all
members of the KCNQ family of potassium ion channels. KCNQ
is a family of multifunctional K+ channels that are involved in a
diverse array of physiological functions, such as cardiac action
potential repolarization, coronary circulation and reactive hy-
peremia, and cerebral neuron excitation (19, 20). KCNQ chan-
nels are also found in airway smooth muscle cells from rodent
and human bronchioles (21). Based on the clinical symptoms
caused by centipede bites and the role of KCNQ in essential
physiological systems, we tested the following two hypotheses:
(i) centipede venom blocks KCNQ channels to disrupt multiple
essential physiological systems, such as cardiovascular, respira-
tory, and nervous systems, and thus (ii) KCNQ openers may
neutralize toxicities caused by centipede envenomation.
Results
Centipedes Rapidly Subdue Mice. To test if centipedes are capable
of rapidly subduing giant prey, golden head centipedes (Scolo-
pendra subspinipes mutilans) with an individual body weight of
∼3 g were kept with a mouse (∼45 g) to observe their interac-
tions. As illustrated in Fig. 1A and Movie S1, a single centipede
immediately attacked the mouse and subdued it within 30 s. The
LD50 values of the centipede crude venom in mice were 130 and
93 mg/kg after i.m. and i.p. injections, respectively (Fig. 1B, In-
set). Capture of giant prey has been reported for social foragers
such as ants (22), spiders (23), or pseudoscorpions (24), in which
Significance
The work showed that centipede venom can cause disorders in
cardiovascular, respiratory, and nervous systems. The cardiovas-
cular toxicity of the venom comes mostly from a peptide toxin
SsTx, which blocks the KCNQ family of potassium channels. Reti-
gabine, a KCNQ channel opener, neutralizes centipede venom
toxicity, and thus could be used to treat centipede envenomation.

 the prey is subdued by several individuals. A single spider,
Zodarion cyrenaicum, can capture a giant ant within 10–20 min
(25). By contrast, the capture efficiency of the centipede is
much higher than that of the spider. This is possible because
the centipedes’ venom has evolved to disrupt multiple essential
physiological systems.
Isolation and Identification of KCNQ Inhibitor from Centipede Venom.
We tracked the toxin that causes the lethal activity by using
peptide purification coupled with toxicity experiments (Fig. 1 B
and C). A small peptide toxin [named here Ssm Spooky Toxin
(SsTx); GenBank accession no. MG585384], with a molecular
weight of 6,017.5 Da, was subsequently identified from the cen-
tipede venom (Fig. 1D). The primary sequence of mature SsTx
was obtained by Edman degradation (Fig. 1D), and the sequence
shows no resemblance to any known animal toxins by a search of
nonredundant protein databases, via the BLAST server (https://
blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Comparing the purified SsTx
with the premature one, we found that the 76-amino acid peptide
undergoes posttranslational modification by cleaving off a signal
peptide of 23 amino acids in length and yielding the mature
peptide of 53 amino acids (Fig. S1A). Partial reduction and MS
indicated that SsTx contains two intramolecular disulfide bridges:
Cys20-Cys46 and Cys24-Cys48 (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1 B–D). SsTx
structure was solved by solution NMR analysis (Fig. 1E, PDB
5X0S). The structure is compact, with amino acids in position 12
(arginine) and 13 (lysine), which form a positively charged surface
(Fig. 1E). The C-terminal of the toxin is relatively flexible.
We examined SsTx on TRPV1, TRPV2, BKCa, hERG, voltage-
gated sodium channels, voltage-gated potassium channels, and
voltage-gated calcium channels (Fig. S1 E–I and O) and found
that SsTx exhibits potent inhibitory effect on KCNQ4, with an
IC50 of 2.5 ± 0.4 μM (Fig. S1 J and K). SsTx also inhibited other
KCNQ channels with IC50 values of 2.8, 2.7, and 2.7 μM for the
homotetrameric complexes of KCNQ1, KCNQ2, and KCNQ5,
respectively (Fig. 1F and Fig. S1 L–N). Further analyses showed
that SsTx blockade becomes progressively less when the mem-
brane potential becomes more depolarized, and that higher K+
concentrations increase the IC50 values (Fig. 1 G and H), con-
sistent with a model in which SsTx binds to the outer pore do-
main of KCNQ channels (26). Since sequences of the outer
pores of members of the KCNQ family exhibit high similarity,
SsTx can inhibit different KCNQ channels and thus affect mul-
tiple physiological processes.
Direct Interaction Between SsTx and KCNQ Channels. Given that
KCNQ4 is important in the regulation of pulmonary vascular
tone, and blocking KCNQ4 increases the isometric tension of
interlobular arteries (27), we hypothesized that SsTx may con-
tribute to the vasospasm by inhibiting the KCNQ4 channel as
reported in clinical cases of centipede envenomation (17). We
therefore first investigated the interaction between SsTx and
KCNQ4. The onset of channel inhibition upon perfusion of
10 μM SsTx is fast, with a time constant of 0.086 ± 0.011 s, and
the recovery of channel current after washout of the toxin is
relatively slow, with a time constant of 0.265 ± 0.007 s (Fig. S2 A
and B), which is consistent with an IC50 of 2.5 μM. Alanine
substitution was performed to identify residues important for
SsTx’s affinity on KCNQ4. Alanine substitution to six positively
charged residues (K4A, K10A, K11A, R12A, K13A, and K45A)
reduces the toxin’s inhibitory effect on KCNQ4 (Fig. 2 A and B).
These mutant toxins preserved WT-like structural features (Fig.
S2C), suggesting that the reduced inhibition is caused by a direct
interaction between SsTx and KCNQ4. In particular, alanine
substitution at positions 12 and 13 increased IC50 values to
104.7 and 117.5 μM, respectively, while that of the WT is 2.5 μM
(Fig. 2C). These two residues in combination with other posi-
tively charged amino acids in the N-terminus form a positively
charged surface in SsTx (Fig. 1E). Collectively, we concluded
that this positively charge surface constitutes the bioactive
binding surface for SsTx to target KCNQ channels. Consistent
with this conclusion, conservative replacement of lysine with
arginine (K13R) or vice versa (R12K) has minimal influence on
SsTx inhibition of KCNQ channels (Fig. S2D).
Next, we explored the toxin-binding sites on KCNQ channels.
Since toxin binding is reduced under depolarizing membrane
potentials and under higher intracellular K+ concentration (Fig.
1 G and H), similar to the “knock off” effect reported by earlier
Fig. 1.

 studies on charybdotoxin (26), we postulated that SsTx interacts
with the pore domain of KCNQ channels. This hypothesis is
consistent with SsTx’s positively charged bioactive surface. We
made point mutations to the residues located on the extracellular
side outer-pore region as well as the extracellular loops of the
KCNQ4 α subunit. We found that D266 in the turret and D288 in
the P-loop region are crucial in SsTx-induced inhibition (Fig. 2D).
In the presence of 10 μM SsTx, ∼99 and 97% inhibitory activity was
lost in KCNQ4_D266G and KCNQ4_D288A, respectively (Fig.
2E). As illustrated in Fig. 2F, the IC50 of SsTx on WT KCNQ4 is
2.5 μM, and the value becomes 108.2 μM for KCNQ4_D266G and
218.8 μM for KCNQ4_D288A. In addition, mutations at both
positions did not affect voltage activation of KCNQ4 (Fig. S2E),
suggesting that these residues directly affect SsTx-KCNQ4 in-
teraction. In a structural homology model of KCNQ4, D266 and
D288 form a negatively charged surface near the outer-pore region
that could interact with SsTx (Fig. S3B).
To further validate interactions between the positively charged
residues on SsTx and the negatively charged residues of KCNQ4,
we applied thermodynamic mutant cycle analysis (28–30) to ex-
perimentally investigate the molecular interactions between SsTx
and KCNQ4 (Fig. 3A, Top). The interaction between the residue
pair is considered energetically significant when the calculated
interaction Ln(Ω) is much larger than the other pairs (31). As
illustrated in Fig. 3 A–D, residue K13 from SsTx and D266 from
KCNQ4 has an Ln(Ω) of 3.12, while the Ln(Ω) values are much
smaller between residues K4, K10, K11, R12, or K45 on SsTx
and residue D266 on KCNQ4. Similarly, residue R12 of SsTx
and residue D288 of KCNQ4 has an Ln(Ω) value of 2.53, while
the Ln(Ω) values for residues K4, K10, K11, K13, or K45 on SsTx
and residue D288 on KCNQ4 are all much smaller (Fig. 3 E and
F and Fig. S2F). These results indicate that residues R12 and
K13 on SsTx functionally interact with residues D288 and D266
on KCNQ, respectively.
We would like to point out that Ln(Ω) values calculated based
on IC50 measurements cannot be interpreted simply as a mea-
sure of physical interactions. In addition, the Hill slope is 1.18 ±
0.03 for inhibition of KCNQ4 by SsTx (Fig. 1F), and thus
multiple SsTx molecules could interact with positive synergy to
inhibit the channel. Consistent with this interpretation, docking
of SsTx onto a structural model of KCNQ4 shows that multiple
SsTx can be accommodated simultaneously (Fig. 3E and Fig.
S2G). Regardless of these complications, D266 and D288 are
highly conserved in all members of the KCNQ family (Fig. S2H)
and thus could form the same “hot spots” in the pore region of
all KCNQ channels. The negatively charged surface patch is also
complementary to the positively charged surface on the toxin.
Overall, our results indicate that the molecular interaction be-
tween SsTx and KCNQ channels is formed by at least two spe-
cific interacting residue pairs as well as van der Waals or
electrostatic interactions contributed by K4, K10, K11, and K45.
SsTx Impairs Cardiovascular Systems. We subsequently investigated
the in vivo effects of SsTx and centipede crude venom on car-
diovascular systems. Following 5- and 10-mg/mL administration
of the venom, the constriction force of the coronary artery in-
creased by ∼1.6 (80%) and ∼2.1 (105%) g, respectively, com-
pared with ∼2.2 g (110%) induced by the positive control,
saturated phenylephrine (Fig. 4A). To determine if SsTx is the
key component of the venom that causes vessel disorder, we
compared the vessel activity of crude venom both in the presence
and absence (CV-SsTx free or CV-Sf) of SsTx. As shown in Fig.
4B, CV-Sf (crude venom without SsTx) has only a small effect on
arterial tension. Compared with 10 mg/mL crude venom-induced

compound, the cells were perfused by bath solution for 30 s to ensure that the currents return to the same level. (B) Normalized inhibitory currents of 50 μM

and 2.05 ± 0.09 (n = 5 cells) for R12A mutants, and 117.5 ± 6.1 μM and 1.93 ± 0.08 (n = 5 cells) for K13A mutants. (D) The normalized inhibitory currents of WT

 vasoconstriction, which was ∼105%, 10 mg/mL CV-Sf only in-
creases the vasoconstriction by ∼7.5%, indicating that SsTx is the
main active component in the venom that exerts vessel activity.
As expected, 1 and 5 μM SsTx increased the constriction force of
the coronary artery by ∼50.3 and ∼105%, respectively (Fig. 4C).
Consistent with the biological mechanism of SsTx, the vessel
toxicity induced by centipede crude venom and SsTx was sig-
nificantly reduced by retigabine (Fig. 4 D and E), a KCNQ
opener (Fig. 4F and Fig. S3A).
As expected, both centipede crude venom and SsTx indeed
exhibit potent activity of vasoconstriction in vivo (Fig. 5). In-
travenous injection of crude venom induced acute hypertension
in mice (Fig. 5A). Additionally, 0.5 mg/kg SsTx induced vaso-
constriction, which further caused a significant increase in blood
pressure (increased by 30.4 ± 5.7% in systolic blood pressure and
by 40 ± 6.3% in diastolic blood pressure) in mice (Fig. 5B). SsTx
also caused vasospasm and acute hypertension in Macaca mon-
keys while atropine and retigabine inhibited the effects (Fig. 5 C
and D). Intravenous injection of retigabine (1 mg/kg) reversed
hypertension induced by SsTx (0.1 mg/kg) as the blood pressure
was reduced from ∼196 mmHg to a normal range (Fig. 5D).
Following i.v. injection of SsTx, the mice kept twitching and
shaking before death (Movie S2), yielding an LD50 of ∼0.85 mg/kg
and the elimination half-life of 4.5 h (Fig. S6C). This lethal ac-
tivity is likely due to coronary-induced myocardial ischemia,
because we observed an inverted T wave in monkeys (Fig. 5E)
after 5 min of i.v. injection of SsTx. The inverted T wave is a
typical syndrome for myocardial ischemia (32). The inverted T
wave was also reversed by retigabine (Fig. 5E). Thus, SsTx-
induced coronary spasm plays a key role in myocardial is-
chemia, which usually progresses to heart failure if ischemic
symptoms are prolonged (33). Unlike scorpion toxins that inhibit
BKCa currents to induce vasospasm (34, 35), centipedes may use
a different strategy by inhibiting KCNQ4 (Fig. S1O). We esti-
mate that one bite from a centipede likely injects 15–30 μL crude
venom, which has a concentration of ∼400 mg peptides per
milliliter, is sufficient to subdue a small rodent (Movie S1). Al-
though crude venoms from certain snakes and snails have higher
lethal activity than that of centipedes (36, 37), it is not clear how
much volume is injected in each attack.
SsTx Causes Disorders of Nervous and Respiratory Systems. Neuronal
KCNQ channels (including KCNQ2, 3, and 5) are the molecular
correlates of the M-current (19). The importance of M-channels
is illustrated by the fact that a 25% decrease in M-current leads
to neonatal epilepsy in humans (38) and that a disruption of
kcnq2 in mice is lethal (39). Since our study shows that SsTx acts
as a potent inhibitor of KCNQ2, KCNQ3, and KCNQ5 (Fig. 1F),
we would like to test whether SsTx could cause seizure or severe
nervous disorder in small animals. Since SsTx does not cross the
blood–brain barrier, the risk of seizure in human after enveno-
mation is less of a concern. However, it could be relevant in small
animals where a centipede bite could go through the skulls. After

 the injection of 1 μL of 20 μM SsTx in the hippocampus, mice
developed seizures instantaneously (Movie S3), resulting in
death after 10–20 min. Since M-current is important for action
potential generation (39) and the release of neurotransmitter
(40), the direct M-channel blockers are severely neurotoxic. To
better understand the electrophysiological changes in hippo-
campal neurons after SsTx application, we conducted patch
clamp recordings on brain slices of mice. At the concentration of
10 μM, SsTx evoked a spiking frequency of ∼20 Hz, much higher
than the untreated neurons (∼12 Hz) (Fig. 6 A and B). Acetyl-
choline concentration in mice hippocampi increased by ∼63.6
and ∼81.8% after the administration of 1 μL of 10 μM SsTx and
100 μM linopirdine (a well-known inhibitor of KCNQ channels),
respectively (Fig. 6C). As expected, retigabine inhibited the
SsTx-induced increase in spiking frequency and acetylcholine
secretion (Fig. 6 A–C), as well as seizure in mice (Movie S3).
Given KCNQ’s important function in the respiratory system
(21), effects of the crude venom and SsTx on rat respiratory
functions were subsequently investigated (Fig. 6 D–H). Follow-
ing the i.v. injection of SsTx, the respiratory rate was significantly
decreased while respiratory amplitude was increased. One-and-
one-half hours after administration of 2 mg/kg SsTx, the re-
spiratory rate was reduced by ∼75% and respiratory amplitude
increased by ∼150% (Fig. 6 D–F). In vitro experiments showed
that crude venom (Fig. 6G) or SsTx (Fig. 6H) can induce
bronchial ring contraction and that the contraction can be re-
duced by retigabine. Our results show that SsTx and the crude
venom cause disorders not only on the cardiovascular system but
also on nervous and respiratory systems.
Discussion
Although venom is a potent weapon for prey capture, its re-
generation requires an increased metabolic rate over a long du-
ration. Thus, strategies of venom optimization likely have evolved
to minimize venom expenditure by venomous animals (7). Tar-
geting of multiple essential physiological systems by centipede
venom is an example of such venom optimization. The centipede
toxin SsTx simultaneously disrupts several essential systems, in-
cluding respiratory, cardiovascular, and perhaps the muscular
system, by blocking multifunctional KCNQ channels. SsTx causes
cardiovascular toxic symptoms including hypertension, myocardial

 ischemia, vasospasm, and twitching (Figs. 4 and 5); neurotoxic
symptoms such as seizure (Fig. 6 A and B); and respiratory dis-
orders such as lowered respiratory rate (Fig. 6 D and E). These
symptoms are clinically relevant because they have been observed
in patients following centipede envenomation (17, 41). Removing
SsTx from the crude venom significantly decreased the toxicity on
the cardiovascular system (Fig. 4 A and B), demonstrating that the
single venom component SsTx plays a crucial role in the prey–
capture strategy.
Among case reports, tissue necrosis is a very common symp-
tom caused by centipede envenomation. Indeed, local injection
of SsTx in the back skin of mice caused significant tissue necrosis
(Fig. S5). This local effect of SsTx is likely caused by spasm of
capillary vessels. In comparison with other reported centipede
crude venom activities, such as platelet-aggregating and phos-
pholipase A2 activities (42), SsTx also seems to be a predominant
factor for local symptoms, especially tissue necrosis.
Severe clinical cardiovascular symptoms, even death, have
been reported following centipede bites, yet no effective thera-
peutic interventions are available. In this study, we illustrate that
KCNQ channels are the likely targets for centipede venom and
that the KCNQ opener retigabine, which is approved for treating
epilepsy, could be used to treat centipede envenomation. Our
experiments at the molecular, cellular, organ, and animal levels
showed that retigabine reverses the effect of either crude centi-
pede venom or purified SsTx. In conclusion, our work reveals
that the centipede has evolved a simple yet powerful strategy to
disable multiple essential physiological systems in prey and shows
that an equally simple strategy could be effective in neutralizing
the venom’s toxicity.
Materials and Methods
Animal procedures were performed in compliance with the Institutional An-
imal Care and Use Committee of Laboratory Animals of Kunming Institute of
Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. For the video recording of the centi-
pede’s bite, the mice were put into a 2-L conical flask to adapt to the envi-
ronment. The centipede was delivered into the conical flask after the mice
were stabilized. Purification, NMR, tissue isolation, cell culture, and electro-
physiological measurements were performed by using standard approaches.
