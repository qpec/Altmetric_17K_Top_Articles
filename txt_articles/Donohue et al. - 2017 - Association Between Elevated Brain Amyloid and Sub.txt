IMPORTANCE Among cognitively normal individuals, elevated brain amyloid (defined by
cerebrospinal fluid assays or positron emission tomography regional summaries) can be
related to risk for later Alzheimer-related cognitive decline.
OBJECTIVE To characterize and quantify the risk for Alzheimer-related cognitive decline
among cognitively normal individuals with elevated brain amyloid.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Exploratory analyses were conducted with longitudinal
cognitive and biomarker data from 445 cognitively normal individuals in the United States
and Canada. Participants were observed from August 23, 2005, to June 7, 2016, for a median
of 3.1 years (interquartile range, 2.0-4.2 years; maximum follow-up, 10.3 years) as part of the
Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
EXPOSURES Individuals were classified at baseline as having normal (n = 243) or elevated
(n = 202) brain amyloid using positron emission tomography amyloid imaging or a
cerebrospinal fluid assay of amyloid β.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Outcomes included scores on the Preclinical Alzheimer
Cognitive Composite (PACC; a sum of 4 baseline standardized Z scores, which decreases with
worse performance), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; 0 [worst] to 30 [best] points),
Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR–Sum of Boxes; 0 [best] to 18 [worst] points), and
Logical Memory Delayed Recall (0 [worst] to 25 [best] story units).
RESULTS Among the 445 participants (243 with normal amyloid, 202 with elevated amyloid),
mean (SD) age was 74.0 (5.9) years, mean education was 16.4 (2.7) years, and 52% were
women. The mean score for PACC at baseline was 0.00 (2.60); for MMSE, 29.0 (1.2); for
CDR–Sum of Boxes, 0.04 (0.14); and for Logical Memory Delayed Recall, 13.1 (3.3). Compared
with the group with normal amyloid, those with elevated amyloid had worse mean scores at 4
years on the PACC (mean difference, 1.51 points [95% CI, 0.94-2.10]; P < .001), MMSE (mean
difference, 0.56 points [95% CI, 0.32-0.80]; P < .001), and CDR–Sum of Boxes (mean
difference, 0.23 points [95% CI, 0.08-0.38]; P = .002). For Logical Memory Delayed Recall,
between-group score was not statistically significant at 4 years (mean difference, 0.73 story
units [95% CI, −0.02 to 1.48]; P = .056).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Exploratory analyses of a cognitively normal cohort followed
up for a median of 3.1 years suggest that elevation in baseline brain amyloid level, compared
with normal brain amyloid level, was associated with higher likelihood of cognitive decline,
although the findings are of uncertain clinical significance. Further research is needed to
assess the clinical importance of these differences and measure longer-term associations.

 C
linical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) has
required the syndrome of dementia with impairment
of multiple cognitive domains sufficient to interfere
with performance of daily activities. Dementia is preceded
by the syndrome of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with
symptoms and objective evidence of cognitive impairment
but with preservation
of function. Biomarkers
of AD pathology, particu-
larly amyloid positron
emission tomography
(PET) or cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) evidence of
brain amyloid, allow
specific identification of
individuals with MCI
likely to progress to AD dementia. MCI accompanied by
such biomarker abnormalities is now considered to be pro-
dromal AD.1
Accumulating evidence suggests that the neurobiology
of AD precedes symptoms by years.2 Approximately one-
third of individuals with clinically normal cognition, who
are at least 65 to 70 years of age, may have biomarker evi-
dence of elevated brain amyloid3—an assertion consistent
with 2 large postmortem studies.4,5 This has been termed
the preclinical stage of AD.3 Studies indicate that elevated
amyloid is associated with risk of cognitive worsening; the
risk of progression to MCI over 5 to 6 years ranges from 11%
to 56% with higher risk associated with biomarker evidence
of neurodegeneration, such as hippocampal atrophy or CSF
tau, at baseline.6-8
The concept of preclinical AD has important implica-
tions for the understanding of aging and AD and for drug
development. Preclinical AD trials have been launched
based on the hypothesis that disease-modifying interven-
tions will be most effective when initiated early.9 However,
a major question remains: is preclinical AD part of AD, with
inevitable progression to symptomatic disease? The pur-
pose of this investigation was to characterize the cognitive
changes among participants of the Alzheimer’
s Disease Neu-
roimaging Initiative (ADNI)10 with normal cognition or sub-
jective memory concerns and to compare individuals with
vs without elevated brain amyloid at baseline.
Methods
The ADNI study has observed individuals diagnosed as cog-
nitively normal or with varying degrees of cognitive impair-
ment since 2005.10 The ADNI battery includes serial evalua-
tions through neuroimaging, CSF, and other biomarkers,
and through clinical and neuropsychological assessments.
For the present analysis, the subset of participants with nor-
mal cognition or a subjective memory concern with CSF
β-amyloid peptide (Aβ42) measurement or amyloid PET
imaging were analyzed. Amyloid PET imaging was con-
ducted with 2 different tracers: Pittsburgh Compound B
(PiB) and florbetapir. Individuals were classified as having
elevated brain amyloid based on high amyloid PET stan-
dardized uptake value ratio (SUVR)11 or low CSF Aβ42.
Amyloid PET SUVRs are a summary of uptake in the frontal,
cingulate, temporal, and parietal regions relative to the
whole cerebellum.
All participants included in the analysis had baseline
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)12 scores of 24 to 30
(range, 0 [worst] to 30 [best]) and Clinical Dementia Rating
(CDR)13 Global and Memory Box scores of 0 (range for each,
0 [best] to 3 [worst]). Logical Memory Delayed Recall14
scores are based on years of education and were required
to be at least 9 for 16 years of education, at least 5 for 8
to 15 years of education, and at least 3 for 0 to 7 years of
education (range, 0 [worst] to 25 [best] story units). Partici-
pants were allowed to have subjective memory concerns
as self-reported or reported by a study partner or clini-
cian. Participants returned for follow-up assessment at
6 months, 1 year, and every year thereafter. Race and eth-
nicity were self-reported using fixed categories as required
by the National Institutes of Health. Data were collected
at 83 ADNI sites in the United States and Canada from
August 23, 2005, to June 7, 2016. ADNI was approved by the
institutional review boards of all participating institutions.
Written informed consent was obtained from all partici-
pants at each site.
Exposure
Only individuals with at least 1 follow-up evaluation and at
least 1 observation of florbetapir amyloid PET, PiB amyloid
PET, or CSF Aβ42 were included in this analysis. Baseline
values of florbetapir SUVR, PiB SUVR, and ventricular vol-
ume were imputed as necessary for individuals with follow-
up, but no baseline observation, using a linear mixed-
effects model. The models included individual-specific
random intercepts and slopes, and fixed effects for
time, age, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriage, and Preclini-
cal Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC)15 at baseline.
PiB SUVR values were then transformed to florbetapir using
the formula y = 0.15 + 0.67x.11 Elevated amyloid at baseline
was defined by florbetapir SUVR greater than 1.1 (a thresh-

Key Points
Question Is there an association between elevated brain amyloid
and cognitive changes among cognitively normal individuals?
Findings In this prospective cohort study of 445 cognitively
normal individuals, baseline elevated brain amyloid was
significantly associated with worse cognitive measures after
a median of 3.1 years (eg, 1.59 points worse on the Preclinical
Alzheimer Cognitive Composite and 0.56 points worse on the
Mini-Mental State Examination after 4 years).
Meaning Elevated baseline brain amyloid was associated
with higher likelihood of cognitive decline among cognitively
normal individuals, although further research is needed
to assess the clinical importance of these differences and
longer-term associations.

 cases from younger healthy control participants in an
independent data set11) or CSF Aβ42 less than 192 pg/mL
(a threshold derived from discrimination of autopsy-
confirmed Alzheimer cases in an independent data set16).
Participants were classified as having elevated amyloid if
they met either threshold. Otherwise, they were classified
as having normal amyloid.
Outcomes
Continuous response variables included PACC (a sum
of 4 baseline standardized z scores [decreases with worse
performance]), MMSE,12 CDR–Sum of Boxes (range, 0 [best]
to 18 [worst]),13 and Logical Memory Delayed Recall.14 Bio-
markers included FreeSurfer ventricular and hippocampal
volumes17; CSF tau, phospho-tau (pTau), Aβ42, fluorodeoxy-
glucose (FDG)-PET, and florbetapir PET.16 FDG-PET was
used to measure glucose metabolism in the brain while
florbetapir PET and PiB PET were used to measure brain
amyloid accumulation. The version of the PACC used in
this analysis was modified from the original because of spe-
cific assessments used in ADNI. In particular, the modified
PACC is a baseline standardized z score composite of the
Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale—Cognitive Subscale
Delayed Word Recall, Logical Memory Delayed Recall,
MMSE, and (log-transformed) Trail-Making Test B Time to
Completion.18 Binary response variables included CDR–
Global scores greater than 0, any increase in CDR–Sum of
Boxes, progression to early MCI, and progression to late
MCI. The distinction between early MCI and late MCI was
based solely on the severity of episodic memory impair-
ment as measured by the Logical Memory II paragraph
recall test. Early MCI and late MCI were defined as having
CDR–Global of greater than 0 and Logical Memory scores
below the education-adjusted thresholds described in
eTable 1 in the Supplement.19
Statistical Methods
The characteristics of the elevated amyloid and normal
amyloid groups were summarized, and differences were
tested by 2-sample t test or Pearson χ2 test. Progression by
amyloid group among ADNI participants with normal cogni-
tion was analyzed using linear and generalized linear
mixed-effects models.20,21 The primary analysis treated
time as continuous. Quadratic terms for time were added if
supported by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC),22 an
objective model selection tool. Additional models were
included that were identical to the primary models except
that time was treated as categorical. These categorical time
models made no assumptions about the shape of temporal
trends, and therefore were useful for assessing the shape
assumptions imposed by the continuous time models. Age,
which is known to be associated with amyloid burden, was
included as a covariate in all models. Additional covariates
were selected by AIC among APOEε4 carriage, sex, family
history of dementia, education, and ventricular volume at
baseline. Baseline cognitive measures were not included as
covariates because they were instead modeled as response
variables. For linear models, the correlation structure was
selected by AIC from random intercept, random slope, com-
pound symmetric, and unstructured options.
The overall amyloid group effect was tested using likeli-
hood ratio tests that compared the full model to a reduced
model with no parameters for amyloid group. Additional
sensitivity analyses included logistic mixed-effects models
of potentially binomial outcomes (MMSE, CDR–Sum of
Boxes, and Logical Memory Delayed Recall). Logistic mixed-
effects models were also fit to repeated binary response
variables. Because fixed effects from logistic mixed effects
are conditional (on random-effects estimates), the paramet-
ric bootstrap was used to derive marginal estimates of event
rates over time and P values. Marginal estimates are more
appropriate for interpretation at the population level. Logis-
tic models included random intercepts only.
Because fewer data were available at the later study vis-
its, point estimates at year 4 were emphasized. The primary
analysis approach, mixed-effect models fit by maximum
likelihood, was robust to data missing at random (ie, miss-
ingness that was dependent only on other data included in
the model). A multiple imputation approach was also
applied that was also robust to the same missing at random
assumption, but it could typically admit more auxiliary vari-
ables, making the missing at random assumption more
plausible. To assess the sensitivity of the results to depar-
tures from missing at random, imputed values for partici-
pants with elevated amyloid were shifted closer to those
with normal amyloid by varying degrees (range, 50%-100%
in 10% increments).23 The minimum factor for which the
amyloid group difference at year 10 was no longer signifi-
cant at the .05 level was reported. This analysis provides an
assessment of how robust the conclusions are to potential
bias induced by attrition.
Participants could continue in the study regardless of
the initiation of any medication for dementia, but no indi-
viduals in this cohort with normal cognition or subjective
memory concerns were taking such medication at baseline.
No adjustments were made to control type I error; therefore,
all analyses should be considered exploratory. All tests were
2-sided and P values smaller than .05 were considered sta-
tistically significant. Models were fit and plotted using R
(version 3.2.2, https://www.R-project.org/).
Results
Key variables by amyloid group are reported in the Table.
Participants were classified as having normal amyloid
(n = 243 [55%]) and elevated amyloid (n = 202 [45%]; 95%
CI, 41% to 50%). The 2 groups had similar percentages of
individuals with subjective memory concerns (22% in the
normal amyloid group and 25% in the elevated amyloid
group) with a difference of 3% (95% CI, −5% to 10%;
P = .53). The elevated amyloid group was older (74.7 vs 73.4
years; P = .02), less educated (16.1 vs 16.7 years; P = .02),
had lower PACC scores (−0.38 vs 0.32; P = .02), and a greater
proportion of individuals with at least 1 APOEε4 allele (42%
vs 16%; difference, 26% [95% CI, 17% to 34%]; P < .001).

Overall, 279 of the 445 participants (63%) were reported to
be still active in the study and the remainder were lost to

maries for the continuous time models of continuous out-

The group with elevated amyloid had worse mean scores
at 4 years on the PACC, MMSE, and CDR–Sum of Boxes. The
mean PACC was 0.16 (95% CI, −0.16 to 0.49) at baseline and
was 0.25 (95% CI, −0.22 to 0.72) at 4 years for normal amy-
loid and −0.23 (95% CI, −0.54 to 0.08) at baseline and −1.27
(95% CI, −1.74 to −0.78) at 4 years for elevated amyloid
(mean difference, 1.51 points [95% CI, 0.94 to 2.08];
P < .001). The MMSE was 29.0 (95% CI, 28.9 to 29.1) at base-
line and 28.9 (95% CI, 28.7 to 29.1) at 4 years for normal
amyloid and 28.9 (95% CI, 28.8 to 29.1) at baseline and 28.3
(95% CI, 28.1 to 28.6) at 4 years for elevated amyloid (mean
difference, 0.56 points [95% CI, 0.32 to 0.80]; P < .001). The
CDR–Sum of Boxes was 0.03 (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.05) at base-
line and 0.31 (95% CI, 0.21 to 0.41) at 4 years for normal amy-
loid and 0.04 (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.06) at baseline and 0.54
(95% CI, 0.43 to 0.66) at 4 years for elevated amyloid (mean
difference, 0.23 points [95% CI, 0.08 to 0.38]; P = .002).
Logical Memory Delayed Recall was 13.1 (95% CI, 12.6 to 13.5)
at baseline and 13.8 (95% CI, 13.2 to 14.4) at 4 years for nor-
mal amyloid and 12.9 (95% CI, 12.5 to 13.4) at baseline and
13.1 (95% CI, 12.5 to 13.7) at 4 years for elevated amyloid
(mean difference, 0.73 story units [95% CI, −0.02 to 1.48];
P = .056). Based on the limited data at 10 years, the mean
amyloid group difference was projected to increase for the
PACC (estimated at 7.40 points [95% CI, 5.30 to 9.50];
P < .001), MMSE (estimated at 3.27 points [95% CI, 2.10 to
4.44]; P < .001), and CDR–Sum of Boxes (estimated at 2.16
points [95% CI, 1.40 to 2.91]; P < .001).
The supplemental material includes other sensitivity
analyses including profiles from models excluding individu-
als with imputed amyloid status (eFigures 4 and 5 in the
Supplement), models excluding individuals with subjective
memory concerns (eFigures 6 and 7 in the Supplement), and
models controlling for age only (eFigures 8 and 9 in the
Supplement). eFigure 10 in the Supplement shows a spa-
ghetti plot of the raw PACC observations, and eFigure 11 in
the Supplement shows profiles from logistic mixed-effects
models of MMSE, CDR–Sum of Boxes, and Logical Memory
Delayed Recall. Results were similar across these supple-
mental analyses.
Figure 2 shows the modeled proportion of progression
events over time by amyloid group with covariates selected
by AIC. The likelihood ratio test for the overall amyloid
group association was significant at P < .001 level for all 4
progression events when time was treated as continuous.
With the categorical time models, the overall amyloid group
association was significant at P < .001 level for CDR–Global
and early MCI and was significant at the P = .01 level for
CDR–Sum of Boxes and late MCI progression. eTables 12
through 15 in the Supplement summarize the covariates
selected by AIC for these models. At 4 years, 32.2% of indi-
viduals with elevated amyloid had developed symptoms
consistent with the prodromal stage of AD, as indicated by a
CDR–Global score of 0.5; in comparison to 15.3% of indi-
viduals with normal amyloid (difference, 16.9% [95% CI,
7.5% to 26.0%]; P < .001). Based on the limited data at 10
years, 88.2% of individuals with elevated amyloid were esti-
mated to have progressed based on the CDR–Global assess-
ment compared with only 29.4% of individuals with normal
amyloid (difference, 58.8% [95% CI, 40.3 to 78.2%];
P < .001). At 4 years, a greater proportion of individuals
with elevated amyloid (14.5%) vs normal amyloid (6.9%)
also progressed on CDR–Sum of Boxes assessment (differ-
ence, 7.6% [95% CI, 1.6% to 12.7%]; P = .003) to early MCI
(normal amyloid, 3.0%; elevated amyloid, 9.2%; difference,
6.2% [95% CI, 2.2% to 9.8%]; P < .001) and to late MCI
(normal amyloid, 1.6%; elevated amyloid, 3.9%; difference,
2.3% [95% CI, 0.079% to 5.0%]; P = .02).
Ventricular volume was selected as a predictor variable in
modelsofPACC(−0.21pointsper%ICV[95%CI−0.41to−0.01];
P = .04), Logical Memory Delayed Recall (−0.25 story units per
%ICV [95% CI, −0.55 to 0.04]; P = .09), CDR–Global progres-
sion (odds ratio [OR] = 1.8 [95% CI, 1.2 to 2.5]; P = .002), CDR–
Sum of Boxes progression (OR = 2.0 [95% CI, 1.3 to 3.1];
P = .002), and early MCI progression (OR = 2.0 [95% CI, 1.1 to
3.7]; P = .03). Family history was only selected as a covariate
in models of the PACC, but the association was not statisti-
cally significant.
Mean biomarker profiles are depicted in Figures 3 and 4.
All the biomarker profiles considered were significantly
separated (P < .001). Among individuals with elevated amy-
loid, those with at least 1 APOEε4 allele showed greater cog-
nitive decline on the modified PACC than those with no ε4
allele (eFigure 12 in the Supplement; likelihood ratio,
P < .001). A greater proportion of individuals with elevated
amyloid initiated antidementia medication use (eFigure 13
in the Supplement, likelihood ratio P = .04).
Themultipleimputationsensitivityanalysisfoundthatthe
estimated differences at year 10 in continuous measures were
significant (P < .05) after shifting the imputed values for the
elevated amyloid group 40% of the way toward the normal
amyloid group (CDR–Sum of Boxes was robust up to a 50%
shift). Differences in the estimated rate of progression at year
10 maintained significance (P < .05) after a 30% shift of CDR–
Global, an 80% shift of CDR–Sum of Boxes, and an 80% shift
of CDR–Global and Logical Memory Delayed Recall for early
MCI progression, and a 70% shift of CDR–Global and Logical
Memory Delayed Recall for late MCI progression.

 Discussion
In this natural history biomarker study of cognitively nor-
mal individuals, a larger proportion of the individuals with
elevated brain amyloid at baseline developed cognitive
symptoms compared with the individuals without elevated
brain amyloid at baseline. Dichotomizing participants into
elevated vs normal amyloid groups separated those with
progressive cognitive decline from those without cognitive
decline. Even though the interpretation was influenced by
the small percentage of participants observed for 10 years,
this suggests that preclinical AD, defined as clinically nor-
mal individuals with elevated brain amyloid,3 may repre-
sent the presymptomatic stage of AD. Additional follow-up
of the ADNI cohort will be important to confirm these obser-
vations. Although this work did not establish a causal role of
elevated amyloid in subsequent decline, these results sup-
ported other findings (eg, genetic data24,25) pointing to the
critical role of amyloid in the neurobiology of AD.
Analyses included a modified version of the PACC,
a cognitive composite designed as an outcome measure for

 preclinical AD trials,15 as well as the MMSE and Logical
Memory tests, which are components of the PACC. Each of
these measures showed little or no decline over 10 years
among individuals without elevated brain amyloid, in con-
trast to decline evident 3 to 4 years from baseline among
those with elevated amyloid.
Biomarker data presented a more complex picture. Mea-
surement of CSF tau, pTau, and Aβ42 showed marked differ-
ences between groups at baseline, indicating association
with brain amyloid elevation (determined in some by CSF
Aβ42 reduction). Longitudinal change in these biomarkers
was similar across groups, suggesting that they are sensitive
to elevated amyloid but do not reflect cognitive and clinical
decline once amyloidosis is established. Brain atrophy, as
reflected by enlargement of ventricular size, showed change
in participants with normal amyloid but greater change in
participants with elevated amyloid. This trend is consistent
with brain atrophy with normal aging that is aggravated in
the presence of amyloid.
In the clinical context, assessment of brain amyloid sta-
tus by lumbar puncture or amyloid PET scan in clinically
normal older individuals supports a diagnosis of preclinical
AD3 with attendant prognostic information. Accurate esti-
mates of sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value regard-
ing the dementia stage of AD will require continued follow-
up. No effective treatments are yet available for preclinical
AD; there may be some value to early diagnosis for family
education and planning. Therapeutic trials are now under-
way to assess whether the prognosis of preclinical AD can
be altered by interventions targeting amyloid.
The modified PACC assessment captures performance on
tasks of episodic memory, orientation, and executive
function—the prominent domains of AD-related cognitive
dysfunction. The longitudinal curves suggested that decline
on the PACC was restricted to those with evidence of
elevated brain amyloid; the participants with normal amyloid
showed minimal change over 10 years. This finding strength-
ens the link between elevated amyloid and the primary
manifestations of AD. Individuals with normal amyloid
remain free of AD-pattern impairment for many years.
The longitudinal CDR curves demonstrated that those par-
ticipants with elevated amyloid were more likely to develop
early symptoms consistent with prodromal AD within 6 years.
This suggests that elevated brain amyloid may indicate a pre-
symptomatic stage of disease rather than a risk factor for dis-
ease; AD is a gradually progressive disorder that can be iden-
tified at the asymptomatic phase using biomarkers of amyloid.
Treatment of preclinical AD with antiamyloid or other inter-
ventions, if shown to be effective, would represent manage-
ment of disease rather than risk reduction. This view is im-
portant in the consideration of risk and benefit inherent in
weighingtherapeuticoptionsfromaregulatoryperspectiveand
foranindividual.Accuratecharacterizationofthepotentialpro-
gression of earliest symptoms may inform discussion of the
utility of screening people for amyloid abnormalities, with or
without effective therapeutic options.
APOE genotype is the most important genetic risk factor
for sporadic AD, and it exerts effects on amyloid accumula-
tion as well as on amyloid-independent mechanisms.26 In the
preclinical AD population in ADNI, the presence of an APOEε4
allelewasassociatedwithsubstantiallyincreasedcognitivede-
cline. This suggests a strong association of APOE genotype, in
addition to the association of amyloid, at this early stage of dis-
ease as has been reported previously.27
Regulatorybodieshavemovedtowardsupportingearlyin-
tervention trials in preclinical AD,28 but uncertainty remains
about ascribing clinical meaningfulness to slowing of progres-
sion at an asymptomatic stage. These analyses of long-term
follow-up of untreated individuals with elevated brain amy-
loid can inform consideration of risk and benefit for putative
disease-modifying interventions.
Estimates of the prevalence of AD are generally based on
assessment of dementia; recent data suggest that there are 5
to 6 million cases of AD in the United States and more than 30
million worldwide.29 Preclinical and prodromal AD represent
predementia stages of the illness. If these stages, which to-
gether last longer than the dementia stage, are included in
prevalence estimates, the numbers of affected individuals are
more than doubled.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the use of antidemen-
tia medications during follow-up was infrequent but greater
in the group with elevated amyloid. This may have slowed the
progression of cognitive decline in some patients and mildly
reduced the between-group difference in rate of decline. Sec-
ond, group differences and changes on continuous measures
are of uncertain clinical importance. Third, the limited num-
ber of observations at the latest time points and high rate of
loss to follow-up in this study raise concerns that conclusions
made about these latest time points might be unsupported ex-
trapolations of earlier trends. However, when models im-
posed no assumptions about the shape of the mean trajecto-
ries, conclusions were similar. These categorical time models
confirm sustained group separation on the PACC occurring as
early as 4 years when 81 observations in the elevated amyloid
group and 106 observations in the normal amyloid group were
observed. With models that impose more structure on the tra-
jectories (continuous time models in Figure 1), group separa-
tion at the P = .003 level on the PACC occurred as early as 2
years (170 in the elevated amyloid group and 205 in the nor-
mal amyloid group). Although median follow-up was only 3.1
years, 25% of participants were observed beyond 4 years; at 8
years,therewere25observationsintheelevatedamyloidgroup
and 36 observations in the normal amyloid group. The mul-
tiple imputation analysis suggests that the conclusions regard-
ing differences at year 10 were robust to substantial depar-
tures from the missing at random assumption used by the
primary analysis models.
Fourth, randomized trials would be necessary to assess
whether interventions based on these study findings affect
the course of the disease. Fifth, tau PET imaging was not con-
ducted, and there was limited collection of CSF tau. Only
83% of participants had lumbar punctures at baseline, which
limited its utility in this analysis. However, ventricular vol-
ume, a robust measure of neurodegeneration, was selected as

 a covariate in several models. The amyloid group effect per-
sisted when ventricular volume was included, suggesting an
association between elevated brain amyloid and cognitive
decline that was independent of neurodegeneration. Sixth,
models did not include a covariate for baseline cognition.
Instead, baseline cognition was modeled as an outcome vari-
able so that the degree of separation at baseline is evident in
the figures. Seventh, because analyses were not specified
prior to beginning data collection in 2005 and because of the
large number of comparisons and potential for type I error, all
analyses should be considered as exploratory.
Conclusions
Exploratory analyses of a cognitively normal cohort fol-
lowed up for a median of 3.1 years suggest that elevation in
baseline brain amyloid level, compared with normal brain
amyloid level, was associated with higher likelihood of cog-
nitive decline, although the findings are of uncertain clinical
significance. Further research is needed to assess the clini-
cal importance of these differences and measure longer-
term associations.
