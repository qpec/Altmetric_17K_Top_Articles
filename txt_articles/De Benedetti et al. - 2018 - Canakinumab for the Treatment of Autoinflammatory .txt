BACKGROUND
Familial Mediterranean fever, mevalonate kinase deficiency (also known as the hyper-
immunoglobulinemia D syndrome), and the tumor necrosis factor receptor–associ-
ated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) are monogenic autoinflammatory diseases char-
acterized by recurrent fever flares.
METHODS
We randomly assigned patients with genetically confirmed colchicine-resistant famil-
ial Mediterranean fever, mevalonate kinase deficiency, or TRAPS at the time of a flare 
to receive 150 mg of canakinumab subcutaneously or placebo every 4 weeks. Patients 
who did not have a resolution of their flare received an add-on injection of 150 mg of 
canakinumab. The primary outcome was complete response (resolution of flare and 
no flare until week 16). In the subsequent phase up to week 40, patients who had a 
complete response underwent a second randomization to receive canakinumab or 
placebo every 8 weeks. Patients who underwent a second randomization and had 
a subsequent flare and all other patients received open-label canakinumab.
RESULTS
At week 16, significantly more patients receiving canakinumab had a complete re-
sponse than those receiving placebo: 61% vs. 6% of patients with colchicine-resistant 
familial Mediterranean fever (P<0.001), 35% versus 6% of those with mevalonate 
kinase deficiency (P 
= 
0.003), and 45% versus 8% of those with TRAPS (P 
= 
0.006). 
The inclusion of patients whose dose was increased to 300 mg every 4 weeks yielded 
a complete response in 71% of those with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterra-
nean fever, 57% of those with mevalonate kinase deficiency, and 73% of those with 
TRAPS. After week 16, an extended dosing regimen (every 8 weeks) maintained 
disease control in 46% of patients with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean 
fever, 23% of those with mevalonate kinase deficiency, and 53% of those with TRAPS. 
Among patients who received canakinumab, the most frequently reported adverse 
events were infections (173.3, 313.5, and 148.0 per 100 patient-years among patients 
with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever, those with mevalonate kinase 
deficiency, and those with TRAPS, respectively), with a few being serious infections 
(6.6, 13.7, and 0.0 per 100 patient-years).
CONCLUSIONS
In this trial, canakinumab was effective in controlling and preventing flares in pa-
tients with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever, mevalonate kinase defi-
ciency, and TRAPS. (Funded by Novartis; CLUSTER ClinicalTrials.gov number, 
NCT02059291.)

Canakinumab for Autoinflammatory Recurrent Fever
F
amilial Mediterranean fever, mev-
alonate kinase deficiency (also known as 
the hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome), 
and the tumor necrosis factor receptor–associ-
ated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) are monogenic 
autoinflammatory diseases that are characterized 
by recurrent fever episodes, with variable skin, 
joint, and serosal involvement.1-3 Flares last sev-
eral days or weeks and affect functional capacity 
and quality of life.4-6 Amyloid A (inflammatory) 
amyloidosis is a long-term complication.7 Colchi-
cine is the standard treatment for familial Mediter-
ranean fever. However, it is ineffective or associ-
ated with unacceptable side effects in 5 to 10% of 
patients.8 No standard treatments are available 
for mevalonate kinase deficiency or TRAPS.
Evidence of excessive interleukin-1β production 
in familial Mediterranean fever, mevalonate kinase 
deficiency, and TRAPS suggests that interleukin-
1β is a common mediator in these diseases, al-
though molecular mechanisms differ. Mutations 
of MEFV cause abnormal activation of the pyrin 
inflammasome.9,10 Mevalonate kinase deficiency 
leads to constitutive activation of the pyrin in-
flammasome and to toll-like receptor–induced 
inflammatory responses.9,11-13 In TRAPS, accu-
mulation of mutant TNFR1 protein within the 
endoplasmic reticulum and abnormal autophagy 
cause interleukin-1β production.14-17 Small stud-
ies have suggested that interleukin-1 inhibition 
improves clinical and laboratory features in col-
chicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever,18-22 
mevalonate kinase deficiency,23 and TRAPS.24,25 
The phase 3 Canakinumab Pivotal Umbrella Study 
in Three Hereditary Periodic Fevers (CLUSTER) 
was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of canakinumab, an anti–interleukin-1β monoclo-
nal antibody, in patients with colchicine-resistant 
familial Mediterranean fever, mevalonate kinase 
deficiency, and TRAPS.
Methods
Trial Design
This trial consisted of one cohort per disease 
(colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever, 
mevalonate kinase deficiency, and TRAPS). Each 
cohort followed the same design (Fig. 1). A screen-
ing period defined eligibility (epoch 1 of the trial). 
Patients with a flare, referred to as a baseline flare, 
were randomly assigned (at the beginning of ep-
och 2), in a 1:1 ratio, to receive subcutaneous 
canakinumab (150 mg, or 2 mg per kilogram of 
body weight for patients weighing ≤40 kg) or 
placebo every 4 weeks. A flare was defined as a 
C-reactive protein (CRP) level of more than 10 mg 
per liter and a physician’s global assessment (PGA) 
score of 2 or higher. To determine the score, physi-
cians assessed global disease activity, taking into 
account fever and clinical signs and symptoms 
associated with each disease (Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org) and using a 
5-point scale, with scores of 0 (none), 1 (minimal), 
2 (mild), 3 (moderate), and 4 (severe).
All the patients were eligible for a blinded dose 
increase if they had a persistent baseline flare 
between days 8 and 14 (PGA score of ≥2, or CRP 
level of >10 mg per liter with <40% reduction 
from baseline) or a lack of resolution at day 15 
(resolution was defined as a PGA score of <2 plus 
a CRP level of ≤10 mg per liter or a reduction by 
≥70% from baseline) (Fig. 1). The blinded dose 
increase consisted of one add-on injection of 
 
150 mg of canakinumab every 4 weeks.
After day 29, patients were eligible for an 
open-label increase in the dose if they had a flare 
(PGA score of ≥2 and CRP level of ≥30 mg per 
liter). Patients receiving placebo could receive 
150 mg of canakinumab every 4 weeks. If they 
still had a PGA score of 2 or higher and a CRP 
level of 30 mg or more per liter, they could receive 
300 mg, or 4 mg per kilogram for patients weigh-
ing 40 kg or more, at their next visit. Patients 
receiving 150 mg of canakinumab every 4 weeks 
could receive 300 mg every 4 weeks.
When entering epoch 3, patients assigned to 
canakinumab who met the primary outcome in 
epoch 2 underwent a second randomization, in a 
1:1 ratio, to receive 150 mg of canakinumab or 
placebo every 8 weeks. The other patients contin-
ued open-label canakinumab. Among patients 
assigned to placebo every 8 weeks in the second 
randomization, those who had a flare within 
 
8 weeks switched to open-label canakinumab at 
a dose of 150 mg every 4 weeks, and those who 
had a flare after more than 8 weeks switched to 
canakinumab at a dose of 150 mg every 8 weeks. 
Patients assigned to canakinumab every 8 weeks 
in the second randomization who had another 
flare switched back to every 4 weeks at any time. 
Any patient who had a flare could receive the 
maximum dose of 300 mg every 4 weeks.

independent ethics committee was obtained at each 
center. Written informed consent was provided by 
patients or guardians, as appropriate. The trial was 
designed by the first, third-to-last, and last authors 
and the sponsor (Novartis). The sponsor was re-
sponsible for all data gathering, processing, and 
management as well as statistical analysis and 
result reporting. The first author was responsible 
for drafting the manuscript with assistance from 
the second and last three authors plus medical 
writers who were paid by Novartis. All the au-
thors vouch for the completeness and accuracy of 
the data and the analysis and for the adherence of 
the trial to the protocol (available at NEJM.org). 
All the authors contributed to revising the manu-
script and made the decision to submit the manu-
script for publication.
Patients
Eligible patients were 2 years of age or older. In-
clusion criteria for patients with colchicine-resis-
tant familial Mediterranean fever were fulfillment 
of Tel-Hashomer diagnostic criteria26 (Table S2 in 
the Supplementary Appendix), at least one known 
MEFV exon 10 mutation,27 and historical data docu-
menting at least one fever episode per month de-
spite a standard dose of colchicine (1.5 to 3.0 mg 
per day or equivalent pediatric-adjusted regimen) 
or at least one fever episode per month with unac-
ceptable side effects to colchicine. Colchicine was 
continued at a stable dose that was not associ-
ated with unacceptable side effects. Inclusion 
criteria for patients with mevalonate kinase de-
ficiency were a genetic27 or enzymatic diagnosis 
of mevalonate kinase deficiency and historical 
data documenting at least three fever episodes in 
a 6-month period. Inclusion criteria for patients 
with TRAPS were TNFRSF1A mutation27 and chron-
ic or recurrent disease (recurrent disease was 
defined as >6 fever episodes per year). If patients 
were currently receiving biologic therapy, histori-
cal data for the previous 12 months were obtained. 
Figure 1. Trial Design Followed by Each Disease Cohort.
The trial design included a screening period of up to 12 weeks (epoch 1), a randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑con‑
trolled period of 16 weeks (epoch 2), a randomized withdrawal and open‑label period of 24 weeks (epoch 3), and an 
open‑label extension period of 72 weeks. The primary outcome of complete response (black star) was evaluated at 
week 16 (end of epoch 2). The secondary outcomes (gray star) of a score on the physician’s global assessment of 
disease activity of less than 2 (on a scale from 0 [none] to 4 [severe]), a C‑reactive protein level of 10 mg or less per 
liter, and a serum amyloid A level of 10 mg or less per liter were evaluated at week 16. The secondary outcome (gray 
star) of the proportion of patients receiving placebo or canakinumab every 8 weeks (second randomization) who 
did not have a flare was evaluated at week 40.

Canakinumab for Autoinflammatory Recurrent Fever
Historical data on the number of fever episodes 
were obtained from medical records. A total of 
18 patients with TRAPS who were participating 
in an open-label study6 entered open-label treat-
ment in epoch 3.
Outcomes
Clinical and laboratory assessments were per-
formed at days 1, 15, and 29 and every 28 days 
thereafter. The number of days with a temperature 
that was higher than 38°C was recorded in an 
electronic diary. The primary outcome was the 
proportion of patients who had a complete re-
sponse, defined as resolution of the baseline flare 
at day 15 (PGA score of <2 plus CRP level of 
≤10 mg per liter or a reduction by ≥70% from 
baseline) and no new flare (PGA score of ≥2 and 
CRP level of ≥30 mg per liter) until week 16. The 
secondary outcomes were the proportion of pa-
tients who had a PGA score of less than 2, a CRP 
level of 10 mg or less per liter, or a serum amy-
loid A (SAA) level of 10 mg or less per liter at week 
16 and, in epoch 3, the proportion of patients 
receiving canakinumab or placebo every 8 weeks 
who had no flare. All outcomes were common 
to the three cohorts.
Statistical Analysis
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics 
were summarized with descriptive statistics. In 
an intention-to-treat approach, patients with a dose 
that was increased during epoch 2 were consid-
ered not to have had a complete response for pri-
mary and secondary outcomes. Data from each 
cohort were analyzed separately. The frequencies 
of patients who had a complete response are 
reported with differences in risk. P values, which 
were calculated with the use of Fisher’s exact test, 
are shown at a two-sided 5% level. Primary and 
secondary objectives were tested in a hierarchical 
testing procedure to control the overall type I er-
ror (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Exploratory analyses were conducted including 
patients who were assigned to canakinumab and 
who received a blinded dose increase to 300 mg 
every 4 weeks. Safety data include exposure up 
to week 40 for all randomly assigned patients and 
epoch 3 data for the patients with TRAPS who 
had been recruited in an open-label study6 (and 
the subsequent multiple patient program imple-
mented to ensure treatment continuity) and con-
tinued to receive canakinumab in epoch 3.
Results
Trial Population
A total of 63 patients with colchicine-resistant famil-
ial Mediterranean fever, 72 with mevalonate kinase 
deficiency, and 46 with TRAPS underwent ran-
domization. Patients had genetically confirmed 
disease (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix) 
and a severe disease course (Table 1). The major-
ity of patients with colchicine-resistant familial 
Mediterranean fever were receiving colchicine. 
In epoch 3, a total of 19 patients with colchicine-
resistant familial Mediterranean fever, 13 with 
mevalonate kinase deficiency, and 9 with TRAPS 
underwent a second randomization. A total of 
40 patients with colchicine-resistant familial 
Mediterranean fever, 53 with mevalonate kinase 
deficiency, and 33 with TRAPS continued open-
label treatment (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). A total of 18 patients with TRAPS 
participating in an ongoing open-label study con-
tinued to receive canakinumab in epoch 3.6 A 
total of 6 patients (5 receiving placebo and 1 re-
ceiving canakinumab) withdrew during epoch 2, 
and 9 patients (all receiving canakinumab) with-
drew during epoch 3. Of the 15 patients who 
withdrew, 4 withdrew owing to adverse events, 
of whom 3 were receiving canakinumab (Fig. S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Efficacy
More patients assigned to canakinumab than to 
placebo had a resolution of the baseline flare at 
day 15 (Fig. 2A, and Table S5 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). At week 16, for all diseases, sig-
nificantly more patients receiving canakinumab 
than those receiving placebo met the primary 
outcome of complete response: 61% versus 6% of 
those with colchicine-resistant familial Mediter-
ranean fever (P<0.001), 35% versus 6% of those 
with mevalonate kinase deficiency (P 
= 
0.003), and 
45% versus 8% of those with TRAPS (P 
= 
0.006) 
(Fig. 2B). In an exploratory analysis involving pa-
tients assigned to canakinumab, inclusion of 
those who received a blinded dose increase to 
300 mg every 4 weeks led to a complete response 
in 71% of those with colchicine-resistant famil-
ial Mediterranean fever, 57% of those with meva-
lonate kinase deficiency, and 73% of those with 
TRAPS (P<0.001 vs. corresponding placebo for 
the three comparisons) (Table S6 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). The proportion of patients

who had a complete response was higher with 
canakinumab than with placebo in all age groups 
(Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).
For secondary outcomes, significantly more 
patients in the canakinumab group than in the 
placebo group had a PGA score of less than 2 
(65% vs. 9% of those with colchicine-resistant 
familial Mediterranean fever [P<0.001], 46% vs. 
6% of those with mevalonate kinase deficiency 
[P 
= 
0.001], and 45% vs. 4% of those with TRAPS 
[P 
= 
0.006]) and a CRP level of 10 mg or less per 
liter (68% vs. 6% of those with colchicine-resis-
tant familial Mediterranean fever [P<0.001], 41% 
vs. 6% of those with mevalonate kinase defi-
ciency [P 
= 
0.002], and 36% vs. 8% of those with 
TRAPS [P 
= 
0.03]) (Fig. 2C, and Table S8 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). For an SAA level of 10 
mg or less per liter, canakinumab was signifi-
cantly superior only in the TRAPS cohort (27% 
vs. 0%, P 
= 
0.047). No further statistical compari-
son was performed as per the hierarchical test-
ing procedure (Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
In epoch 3, among patients who underwent a 
second randomization to canakinumab or placebo 
every 8 weeks, a lower proportion of those receiv-
ing canakinumab than those receiving placebo 
had flares in all three cohorts (overall, 6 of 19 
patients [32%] vs. 16 of 22 [73%]) (Table S9 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Among patients 
who had a complete response in epoch 2, all the 
patients with colchicine-resistant familial Medi-
terranean fever, 82% of those with mevalonate 
kinase deficiency, and 83% of those with TRAPS 
maintained an absence of flares up to week 40 
(Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). In pa-
tients who did not have a complete response, the

was higher than 38°C (from baseline to week 40, 
normalized to 1 year) was 11.3 in those with 
colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever, 
19.8 in those with mevalonate kinase deficiency, 
and 23.1 in those with TRAPS. In patients who 
did not have a complete response, although the

before baseline was 32.5 in patients with colchi-
cine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever, 14.7 
in those with mevalonate kinase deficiency, and 
10.1 in those with TRAPS, the mean number of 
flares (from baseline to week 40, normalized to 
1 year) was 1.2, 2.0, and 1.2, respectively (Fig. 3).
An extended dosing interval of canakinumab 
every 8 weeks was sufficient to maintain disease 
control in 46% of patients with colchicine-resis-
Figure 2. Resolution of Baseline Flare and Response Rate for Primary and Secondary Outcomes at the End of Epoch 2 (Week 16).
Panel A shows the rates of patients assigned to placebo or to 150 mg of canakinumab every 4 weeks who had a resolution of their base‑
line flare by day 15 (defined as a physician’s global assessment [PGA] score of <2 plus a C‑reactive protein [CRP] level of ≤10 mg per liter 
or a reduction by ≥70% from baseline). The PGA measures disease severity, taking into account fever and clinical signs and symptoms 
associated with each disease (see Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix), with the use of a 5‑point scale with scores of 0 (none),  
1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), and 4 (severe). Panel B shows the rates of patients assigned to placebo or to 150 mg of canakinum‑
ab every 4 weeks who met the primary outcome of complete response, defined as the resolution of the baseline flare by day 15 (defined 
as in Panel A) and no new flare (defined as a PGA score of ≥2 and a CRP level of ≥30 mg per liter) until week 16. Panel C shows the 
rates of patients assigned to placebo or to 150 mg of canakinumab every 4 weeks who met the secondary outcomes of a PGA score of 
less than 2, a CRP level of 10 mg or less per liter, and a serum amyloid A (SAA) level of 10 mg or less per liter. The term crFMF denotes 
colchicine‑resistant familial Mediterranean fever, MKD mevalonate kinase deficiency, and TRAPS the tumor necrosis factor receptor–

tant familial Mediterranean fever, 23% of those 
with mevalonate kinase deficiency, and 53% of 
those with TRAPS (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). An increase in the dose to 300 mg 
every 4 weeks was required in 10% of patients 
with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean 
fever, 29% of those with mevalonate kinase de-
ficiency, and 8% of those with TRAPS (Fig. S3 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). At week 40, levels 
of SAA had decreased in all cohorts, with a median 
of 20.0, 14.5, and 10.5 mg per liter in patients with 
colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever, 
those with mevalonate kinase deficiency, and those 
with TRAPS, respectively, with approximately 25% 
of patients having levels of more than 50 mg per 
liter and more than half having levels of less 
than 20 mg per liter (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Safety
No opportunistic infections, cases of tuberculosis, 
or deaths occurred. During epoch 2, the number 
of adverse events and serious adverse events was 
higher in patients receiving canakinumab than 
in those receiving placebo (Table 2, and Table S10 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Overall, the most 
frequently reported adverse events were infec-
tions (particularly respiratory infections), abdom-
inal pain, headaches, and injection-site reactions 
(Table 2, and Tables S10 and S11 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). The rate of serious adverse 
events per 100 patient-years with placebo versus 
canakinumab was 97.4 versus 42.7 among pa-
tients with colchicine-resistant familial Mediter-
ranean fever, 135.5 versus 57.6 among those with 
mevalonate kinase deficiency, and 50.0 versus 
24.8 among those with TRAPS. The cumulative 
rates of adverse events and serious adverse events 
during epochs 2 and 3 did not increase as com-
pared with the rates during epoch 2 alone.
Twelve infections were serious. All resolved 
without sequelae. Two serious infections occurred 
in patients receiving placebo: pneumonia in a 
patient with colchicine-resistant familial Mediter-
ranean fever, and infectious diarrhea in a patient 
with mevalonate kinase deficiency (rate of seri-
ous infection in the combined placebo groups, 
24.9 per 100 patient-years). Three serious infec-
tions (one each of cellulitis, pelvic abscess, and 
pharyngotonsillitis) were reported in two patients 
with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean 
fever receiving canakinumab, and seven serious 
infections (three cases of pneumonia and one 
each of pharyngitis, laryngitis, gastroenteritis, and 
conjunctivitis) were reported in six patients with 
mevalonate kinase deficiency receiving canakinum-
ab (rate of serious infection in all cohorts receiv-
ing canakinumab, 7.4 per 100 patient-years).
Adverse events led to discontinuation of 
canakinumab in two patients with mevalonate 
kinase deficiency during epoch 2 (one patient had 
a disease flare, and one had an event of pericardi-
tis) and in two patients with TRAPS during epoch 
3 (one patient had grade 2 neutropenia, which was 
considered by the investigator to be related to 
canakinumab and which resolved in 5 days, and 
one had a mild reduction in the glomerular filtra-
tion rate, which was considered to be unrelated to 
the canakinumab). During epoch 2, two patients 
receiving canakinumab (one with mevalonate ki-
nase deficiency and one with TRAPS) had grade 3 
neutropenia, which resolved. No additional grade 
3 neutropenia was reported during epoch 3.
Discussion
In this trial, canakinumab was efficacious in con-
trolling and preventing flares in colchicine-resis-

tant familial Mediterranean fever, mevalonate 
kinase deficiency, and TRAPS and produced rapid 
and sustained improvement in children and adults 
with severe disease documented by a high num-
ber of fever episodes in disease history. Our re-
sults corroborate open-label observations with 
interleukin-1 inhibitors in these diseases18-25 and 
the results of two small, controlled trials of other 
interleukin-1 inhibitors (rilonacept28 [also known 
as interleukin-1 trap] and anakinra29) in colchicine-
resistant familial Mediterranean fever.
The design of our trial was chosen to address 
the rarity of the diseases, the wide age range, and 
the need for a randomized, controlled trial, while 
exploiting the hypothesis of a key common me-
diator. It also allowed the creation of a larger 
safety database than could have been generated 
for one disease. In diseases characterized by acute 
recurrences, we used, as a clinically meaningful 
efficacy measure, a complete response that in-
cluded resolution of the baseline flare and main-
tenance of the absence of flares over a period of 
16 weeks.
Because the trial included three diseases with 
different frequencies and durations of fever epi-
sodes and different clinical presentations (e.g., 
frequent serositis in familial Mediterranean fe-
ver but not in TRAPS or mevalonate kinase defi-
ciency), we chose a definition of flare that was 
based on the PGA score, a comprehensive clini-
cal measure of severity, and the CRP level, a bio-
chemical measure of inflammation. The same 
definition of flare was used in the controlled 
trial of canakinumab in cryopyrinopathies.30 In-
deed, the PGA is part of several outcome mea-
sures for rheumatic diseases and is routinely used 
in clinical practice and trials, including open-label 
studies of canakinumab in colchicine-resistant 
familial Mediterranean fever, mevalonate kinase 
deficiency, and TRAPS.6,18,23 Although it reduces 
the effect of the experience of the patient or the 
patient’s parent on assessment of severity, it 
solves the problem that the results of patient or 
parent assessment may not be comparable among 
adults, adolescents, and parents responding on 
behalf of children.31
Few patients receiving placebo had a complete 
response; this supports the appropriateness of 
the primary outcome. In patients assigned to 
canakinumab, including those who received a 
blinded dose increase to 300 mg every 4 weeks, 
a complete response occurred in 71% of patients 
with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean 
fever, 57% of those with mevalonate kinase de-
ficiency, and 73% of those with TRAPS. Among 
patients who had a complete response, all the 
patients with colchicine-resistant familial Medi-
terranean fever and more than 80% of patients 
with mevalonate kinase deficiency or TRAPS had 
no flare as of week 40, findings that indicate 
that responses were durable.
Patients benefited from canakinumab even 
without having had a complete response. Patients 
who did not have a complete response had a lower 
number of days of fever per year (11 in patients 
with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean 
fever, 20 in those with mevalonate kinase defi-
ciency, and 23 in those with TRAPS) than re-
ported in the literature: 33.2 for familial Mediter-
ranean fever,32 33.6 to 48 for mevalonate kinase 
deficiency,1,32 and 64.3 to 83.1 for TRAPS.2,32 In all 
cohorts, the number of flares per year during 
the trial was less than 2 in patients who did not 
have a complete response. The apparent discrep-
ancy between the number of flares and the num-
ber of days of fever might be explained by low 
PGA scores or by an increase in the CRP level to 
less than 30 mg per liter, suggesting reduced se-
verity of episodes. In patients who did not have 
a complete response, the number of flares per 
year during the trial was also remarkably lower 
than the number of fever episodes in the 12 
months before baseline (ranging from 32 in pa-
tients with colchicine-resistant familial Mediter-
ranean fever to 10 in those with TRAPS). Infor-
mation about flares, defined according to trial 
criteria, was collected prospectively, whereas in-
formation on episodes of fever before baseline 
was collected retrospectively. Although several 
patients had SAA levels that did not reach a nor-
mal range, at week 40 the majority of the pa-
tients had SAA levels of less than 20 mg per liter, 
levels that are associated with decreased pro-
gression of amyloid A amyloidosis.33
During epoch 3, an extended dosing regimen 
(every 8 weeks) was evaluated to gain informa-
tion about the maintenance dose of canakinum-
ab. With this regimen, an absence of flares was 
maintained in approximately half the patients 
with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean 
fever and TRAPS; approximately one third of the 
patients in these two cohorts switched to a regi-
men equivalent to the starting dose of 150 mg 
every 4 weeks. In contrast, findings from the

Canakinumab for Autoinflammatory Recurrent Fever
blinded dose increase in epoch 2 and dose ad-
justment in epoch 3 suggest that a higher dose 
of canakinumab may be needed to control and 
prevent disease flares in patients with mevalon-
ate kinase deficiency.
No deaths, opportunistic infections, or can-
cers were reported. In all three cohorts, infections 
were more numerous in the canakinumab group 
than in the placebo group. The rate of infectious 
events and serious infectious events did not in-
crease during epoch 3. The rate of serious infec-
tions in the three cohorts receiving canakinumab 
(7.4 per 100 patient-years) appears to be similar 
to that observed among patients with cryopyri-
nopathies who received canakinumab (5.6 per 
100 patient-years).34,35 Infections appeared to be 
more frequent among patients with mevalonate 
kinase deficiency than among those with colchi-
cine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever or 
TRAPS; this is possibly related to the younger 
age of this cohort. Although most infections 
were not serious and all of them resolved with-
out sequelae, vigilance for suspected infections 
is required. Adverse events led to discontinuation 
of canakinumab in four patients: two patients 
had events related to a lack of efficacy, one had 
grade 2 neutropenia, and one had a mild reduc-
tion in the glomerular filtration rate, which was 
considered to be unrelated to the drug. Two ad-
ditional episodes of grade 3 neutropenia were 
reported in two patients receiving canakinumab; 
both resolved spontaneously with no concurrent 
infections.
In conclusion, CLUSTER, which used a novel 
approach of grouping separate diseases with dif-
ferent genetic causes on the basis of a common 
targetable pathogenic mediator, provided evidence 
of a pathogenic role of interleukin-1β in colchi-
cine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever, mev-
alonate kinase deficiency, and TRAPS. It also 
showed that the inhibition of interleukin-1β was 
efficacious in controlling and preventing flares 
in patients with these diseases.
