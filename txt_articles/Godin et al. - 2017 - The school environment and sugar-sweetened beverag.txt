Abstract
Objective: The current study sought to examine Guatemalan adolescents’
consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), identify which individual-
level characteristics are associated with SSB consumption and describe school
characteristics that may influence students’ SSB consumption.
Design: Within this observational pilot study, a questionnaire was used to assess
students’ consumption of three varieties of SSB (soft drinks, energy drinks,
sweetened
coffees/teas),
as
well
as
a
variety
of
sociodemographic
and
behavioural characteristics. We collected built environment data to examine
aspects of the school food environment. We developed Poisson regression models
for each SSB variety and used descriptive analyses to characterize the sample.
Setting: Guatemala City, Guatemala.
Subjects: Guatemalan adolescents (n 1042) from four (two public, two private)
secondary schools.
Results: Built environment data revealed that students from the two public schools
lacked access to water fountains/coolers. The SSB industry had a presence in the
schools through advertisements, sponsored food kiosks and products available for
sale. Common correlates of SSB consumption included school type, sedentary
behaviour, frequency of purchasing lunch in the cafeteria, and frequency of
purchasing snacks from vending machines in school and off school property.
Conclusions: Guatemalan adolescents frequently consume SSB, which may be
encouraged by aspects of the school environment. Schools represent a viable
setting for equitable population health interventions designed to reduce SSB
consumption, including increasing access to clean drinking-water, reducing access
to SSB, restricting SSB marketing and greater enforcement of existing food policies.

Latin America
Many low- and middle-income countries in Latin America
are experiencing a double burden of malnutrition, char-
acterized by the persistence of undernutrition coupled
with dramatic increases in the prevalence of overweight/
obesity(1–3). The prevalence of overweight/obesity in Latin
American adolescents ranges from 18·9 to 36·9 %(4) and
reflects a notable shift from traditional diets to a greater
intake of nutrient-poor, energy-dense foods, such as
sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB)(3,5).
Latin Americans are among the greatest consumers of SSB
globally(6). For instance, Guatemalan females and males
consume an average of 2·7 and 2·9 SSB servings/d, respec-
tively(6). The high frequency of SSB consumption in Latin
America, and Guatemala particularly, is concerning, given
the associations between SSB intake and increased risk of
overweight/obesity(7–13), lower intake of micronutrients(14–17)
and the development of dental caries(18–22). These factors
underscore the need to examine adolescents’ SSB con-
sumption and identify the factors that promote SSB intake.
Schools represent an important area of influence for
adolescents, given their population coverage and the
amount of time youth spend in school. School-based
interventions may represent a promising strategy to address
the ‘double burden’(23,24). However, few studies have
examined the school food environment in Guatemala and
its potential influence on students’ diets. These data could

 inform culturally relevant school-based interventions to
decrease youths’ SSB intake at the population level.
The present pilot study sought to examine SSB intake in
a sample of Guatemalan adolescents, identify individual-
level characteristics associated with SSB consumption
and describe school characteristics that may influence
students’ SSB intake.
Methods
Study overview
The current study used data from a convenience sample of
schools
in
Guatemala
City
that
participated
in
the
COMPASS Guatemala pilot study during the 2014/15
school year(25). Details on COMPASS and the Guatemala
pilot
study
can
be
found
online
(www.compass.
uwaterloo.ca) and in print(25,26).
Participants
Four
secondary
schools
participated
in
COMPASS
Guatemala. Schools 1 and 2 were public (i.e. students
attend for free), while Schools 3 and 4 were private
(i.e. students paid tuition). All students enrolled in these
schools (n 1359) were eligible to participate, and the
participation rate was high (n 1277, 94·0 %). We removed
235 (18·4 %) participants from analyses due to missing
data; however, we included those with missing BMI data.
The final sample comprised 1042 participants.
Data collection tools
School- and student-level data were collected through the
COMPASS school environment application (Co-SEA) and
the
COMPASS
student
questionnaire
(Cq),
respec-
tively(27,28). The process of adapting and evaluating these
tools in the Guatemalan context is described else-
where(25). COMPASS staff used the Co-SEA to assess
school infrastructure by recording this information via
notes and photographs. The Cq is a paper-based ques-
tionnaire that students completed during class, comprising
questions on demographic characteristics and several
health behaviours.
Outcome, control and potential explanatory
variables
Participants’ responses to the following three Cq questions
reflect the three outcome measures: ‘On a typical school
day (Monday to Friday), on how many days do you do the
following: (i) drink soft drinks (e.g. soda, fruit drinks,
Gatorade, etc.). Do not include diet or sugar-free drinks;
(ii) drink energy drinks (e.g. Red Bull, Monster, Adrena-
line, etc.); and (iii) drink coffee or tea with sugar
(e.g. cappuccino, frappuccino, iced tea, iced coffees,
etc.)?’ These questions are similar to those asked in the
Canadian Cq, although we modified the examples to
reflect drinks that are commonly available in Guatemala.
We reviewed data collectors’ Co-SEA photographs and
notes to examine the presence of water coolers/fountains
and SSB industry-sponsored food kiosks within the
schools. School administrators confirmed the presence/
absence of these facilities within their schools.
We treated gender, grade, weight status (i.e. BMI
(kg/m2) category based on reported height and weight
and WHO classifications, adjusted for age and sex(29)) and
school type (private, public) as control variables. The
Guatemalan secondary school system comprises three
‘basic grades’ and two ‘professional training’ grades, which
we denoted as grades 1–5, representing adolescents aged
13–18 years. We considered school type as a marker of
participants’ socio-economic status, consistent with pre-
vious research(30,31).
We selected potential explanatory variables based on a
priori hypotheses and previous literature. They included
tobacco, marijuana and alcohol use, sedentary behaviour,
physical activity, bullying victimization and weight goal.
We defined these variables in a manner that is consistent
with previous COMPASS studies(32–36). We also considered
four food purchasing behaviours as potential explanatory
variables, which reflect participants’ weekday frequency
of purchasing lunch and snacks from various food outlets
on and off school property.
Data analysis
We used descriptive statistics to examine variation in
participants’ mean number of weekdays of consuming
each SSB type across school- and individual-level socio-
demographic and behavioural variables, and univariate
Poisson regression analyses to identify the significance of
this variation.
We developed a separate joint Poisson regression
model for each SSB type using a two-step process. First,
we ran a series of univariate analyses to identify if each
potential explanatory variable was independently asso-
ciated with each outcome. We removed variables that
were not statistically significantly (P > 0·2) from the ana-
lysis. Second, we included all significant variables from
this first screening stage in a multivariate model and used
backward selection to drop the least significant variable,
until all variables were statistically significant (P < 0·05).
We forced control variables into the models. We per-
formed statistical analyses using the statistical software
package SAS version 9.4.
Results
Drinking-water from fountains/coolers was inaccessible
for students at Schools 1 and 2, while Schools 3 and 4
contained purified water coolers for students and staff.
Schools 1, 2 and 4 contained industry-sponsored food
kiosks that students could access during lunch and school
breaks. The Co-SEA data demonstrated the presence of the
SSB intake and Guatemalan school environment
2981
 SSB industry in schools through advertisements, products
available for sale and donated goods. For example,
Schools 2 and 4 displayed athletic trophies featuring
Coca-Cola® and Pepsi® logos.
Participants reported consuming soft drinks, sweetened
coffees/teas and energy drinks an average of 2·58, 2·40
and 0·58 d in a typical school week. Few participants
reported no use of soft drinks (n 210, 20·2 %) and swee-
tened coffees/teas (n 308, 29·6 %) in a typical school
week; however, 74·2 % of participants (n 773) reported no
use of energy drinks. Similarly, daily reported use was
relatively common with respect to soft drinks (n 293,
28·1 %) and sweetened coffees/teas (n 321, 30·8 %),
although rare with energy drinks (n 40, 3·8 %).
Table 1 presents the average weekday frequency of SSB
consumption across school- and individual-level char-
acteristics. There was significant (P < 0·05) variation in
participants’ frequency of SSB consumption according to
school, school type, grade, alcohol use, sedentary beha-
viour, weight goal and the food purchasing variables,
across all three SSB outcomes.
Table 2 shows the adjusted relative rates derived from
the Poisson regression analyses for the final models.
Common correlates of SSB consumption across all models
include school type, sedentary behaviour, frequency of
purchasing lunch in the cafeteria, and frequency of pur-
chasing snacks from a vending machine on and off school
property. Participants who purchased lunch or snacks
from various food outlets at a greater frequency had a
significantly higher rate of SSB consumption across all
three
categories,
as
did
public-school
students.
For
example, the relative rate of 1·28 denotes that public-
school students consume soft drinks at a 28 % greater rate
than private-school students (i.e. in terms of weekdays
reporting soft drink consumption), controlling for all other
variables.
Discussion
The present study underscores the high rate of SSB con-
sumption among a sample of Guatemalan adolescents,
socio-economic differences in consumption, and adoles-
cents’ food purchasing behaviours as important predictors
of SSB intake.
Participants reported a high consumption frequency of
soft drinks and sweetened coffees/teas. Guatemala is a
global leader in coffee-growing, and unlike in Western
nations, coffee is commonly served to young children and
toddlers in Guatemala(37,38). Previous research has identi-
fied that sweetened coffee is the most commonly reported
consumed beverage among Guatemalan schoolchildren,
largely due to cultural tradition(39). Prevention efforts
should focus on decreasing youths’ consumption of soft
drinks, since they are the most popular SSB among
adolescents and have limited cultural significance (i.e.
unlike coffees/teas).
Public-school
participants
reported
a
significantly
higher rate of SSB consumption than private-school parti-
cipants across all beverage categories. The discrepancy
may reflect, in part, the lack of access to water fountains/
coolers we observed within public schools. The lack of
this healthy alternative may encourage public-school
students to purchase other, less healthful beverages in
school. Other research from Guatemala has identified low
water consumption among marginalized sub-populations
due to limited access to clean drinking-water, perceptions
that tap water is unsafe to drink and the costliness
of bottled water(40,41). These findings underscore the
importance of considering health equity in population-
level
interventions
designed
to
reduce
adolescents’
SSB intake.
We identified a positive correlation between purchasing
meals/snacks from school food outlets and SSB con-
sumption, suggesting that the school food environment
may encourage SSB intake. Many Guatemalan youth
purchase products from school food kiosks, including
those who bring a home-packed lunch to school(42). The
Guatemalan Ministry of Education has attempted to pro-
hibit the sale of SSB and other processed foods within
schools(43,44). While the present study did not explicitly
examine the types of foods offered through these outlets,
there is evidence that these regulations are largely unen-
forced, as many vendors offer a range of energy-dense
snacks
and
beverages(42,45).
Stricter
enforcement
of
current regulations for school foods in Guatemala, or
perhaps new regulations, may reduce access to and
discourage consumption of SSB and other unhealthy
products among students.
The present study identified the SSB industry’s presence
in Guatemalan secondary schools via sponsored kiosks
stocked with SSB, branded donated goods and advertise-
ments. It is feasible that the availability of and exposure to
SSB in school food outlets encourages students to con-
sume these beverages, since they increase students’ access
to these items and may also influence their food selections
and
perceptions
of
appropriate
dietary
choices(46).
Research from North America has demonstrated the
positive association between in-school SSB availability and
consumption(47–51), although these associations have not
been well explored in low- and middle-income countries.
This research gap underscores the need for greater
investment
in
research
platforms
like
COMPASS
in
Guatemala and other low- and middle-income countries.
Other research has identified that most food advertise-
ments in food outlets within and surrounding Guatemala
schools feature SSB, which increase youth’s exposure to
these brands(45). The presence of the SSB industry in
Guatemalan schools suggests that the beverage industry is
capitalizing on this unregulated environment to access a
key subgroup of consumers. Collectively, these features

 contribute to a food environment that can undermine
individual efforts to improve dietary behaviours.
The
present study has
many strengths,
including
providing valuable evidence on the extent of SSB con-
sumption among Guatemalan youth. The large student
sample size and inclusion of public and private schools
enable comparisons across socio-economic groups. The
study also contributed to the creation of a new research
collaboration between Guatemalan and Canadian health
researchers and research capacity building in a low- and
middle-income country.
Our findings should be interpreted in light of the study’s
limitations. First, the outcomes reflect conservative esti-
mates of SSB intake (i.e. relative to data on volume or
number of servings), since the unit of measure is number of
‘days’ and participants can consume numerous SSB daily.
Second, the samples of participants included in the ana-
lyses v. removed were significantly different across several
demographic variables (see online supplementary material,
Supplemental Table 1); however, these groups did not vary

SSB intake and Guatemalan school environment
2985
 Canadian guidelines, due to the lack of Guatemalan
guidelines. While there were several efforts to evaluate the
appropriateness
and
students’
comprehension
of
the
Guatemalan Cq, we did not formally adapt the tool. Finally,
the present pilot study included four schools, which may
not represent other school environments in Guatemala.
Conclusions
Guatemalan adolescents frequently consume SSB. Ado-
lescents’ purchasing from food outlets on and near school
property represent important predictors of SSB intake.
School-level interventions may be well poised to address
the high rate of SSB intake among Guatemalan youth.
Specific strategies include increasing the availability of free
drinking-water to students, decreasing access to SSB,
restricting
SSB
marketing
and
enforcing
legislation
surrounding the sale of SSB in schools.
