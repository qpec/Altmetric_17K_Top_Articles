Abstract
Aims/hypothesis The double-blind Trial Comparing
Cardiovascular Safety of Insulin Degludec vs Insulin
Glargine in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes at High Risk of
Cardiovascular Events (DEVOTE) assessed the cardiovascu-
lar safety of insulin degludec. The incidence and rates of
adjudicated severe hypoglycaemia, and all-cause mortality
were also determined. This paper reports a secondary analysis
investigating associations of severe hypoglycaemia with car-
diovascular outcomes and mortality.
Methods In DEVOTE, patients with type 2 diabetes were
randomised to receive either insulin degludec or insulin
glargine U100 (100 units/ml) once daily (between dinner
and bedtime) in an event-driven, double-blind, treat-to-target
cardiovascular outcomes trial. The primary outcome was the
first occurrence of an adjudicated major adverse cardiovascu-
lar event (MACE; cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial
infarction or non-fatal stroke). Adjudicated severe
hypoglycaemia was the pre-specified secondary outcome. In
the present analysis, the associations of severe hypoglycaemia
with both MACE and all-cause mortality was evaluated in the
pooled trial population using time-to-event analyses, with se-
vere hypoglycaemia as a time-dependent variable and
randomised treatment as a fixed factor. An investigation with
interaction terms indicated that the effect of severe
hypoglycaemia on the risk of MACE and all-cause mortality
were the same for both treatment arms, and so the temporal
association for severe hypoglycaemia with subsequent MACE
and all-cause mortality is reported for the pooled population.
Results There was a non-significant difference in the risk of
MACE for individuals who had vs those who had not experi-
enced severe hypoglycaemia during the trial (HR 1.38, 95%
CI 0.96, 1.96; p = 0.080) and therefore there was no temporal
relationship between severe hypoglycaemia and MACE.
There was a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality
for patients who had vs those who had not experienced severe

 hypoglycaemia during the trial (HR 2.51, 95% CI 1.79, 3.50;
p < 0.001). There was a higher risk of all-cause mortality 15,
30, 60, 90, 180 and 365 days after experiencing severe
hypoglycaemia compared with not experiencing severe
hypoglycaemia in the same time interval. The association be-
tween severe hypoglycaemia and all-cause mortality was main-
tained after adjustment for the following baseline characteris-
tics: age, sex, HbA1c, BMI, diabetes duration, insulin regimen,
hepatic impairment, renal status and cardiovascular risk group.
Conclusions/interpretation The results from these analyses
demonstrate an association between severe hypoglycaemia
and all-cause mortality. Furthermore, they indicate that pa-
tients who experienced severe hypoglycaemia were particu-
larly at greater risk of death in the short term after the
hypoglycaemic episode. These findings indicate that severe
hypoglycaemia is associated with higher subsequent mortali-
ty; however, they cannot answer the question as to whether
severe hypoglycaemia serves as a risk marker for adverse
outcomes or whether there is a direct causal effect.

Introduction
People with diabetes are at an increased risk of cardiovascular
disease and cardiovascular-related death compared with those
without diabetes [1]. Hypoglycaemic events, particularly
when severe, have been linked to subsequent adverse cardio-
vascular outcomes and mortality in individuals with diabetes,
although it is currently unknown whether this link is causal,
predictive of greater vulnerability or both [2–4].
The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes
(ACCORD) trial was the first large-scale diabetes trial to re-
port that intensive blood glucose management to normalise
blood glucose levels (HbA1c target < 6% [42 mmol/mol])
was associated with a significant increase in the risk of
cardiovascular-specific mortality, a factor that led to the early
termination of the trial [5]. Hypoglycaemia was suggested as a
possible mechanism for the increased number of fatal events
in the intensive treatment arm of ACCORD, although this
association was not clearly demonstrated [6]. However, the
ACCORD trial did describe a significantly increased risk of
a fatal event after a severe hypoglycaemic event, in both the
standard and the intensive treatment arms [6]. Furthermore, a
subsequent meta-analysis of several clinical trials and obser-
vational studies suggested that severe hypoglycaemia was as-
sociated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events [7, 8].
Conclusive evidence of a direct causal relationship between
hypoglycaemia and cardiovascular events and mortality is
lacking, but experimental evidence in adults without diabetes
suggests that hypoglycaemia-induced abnormalities of cardiac
repolarisation may contribute to the risk of sudden death [9].
Insulin degludec is a once-daily basal insulin with an ultra-
long duration of action, approved for use in adults, adolescents
and children with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes [10, 11]. A
major clinical benefit of insulin degludec is that it significantly
lowers the risk of hypoglycaemia compared with insulin
glargine U100 (100 units/ml) [12–15].
The double-blind Trial Comparing Cardiovascular Safety of
Insulin Degludec vs Insulin Glargine in Patients with Type 2
Diabetes at High Risk of Cardiovascular Events (DEVOTE)
was initiated to assess the cardiovascular safety of insulin
degludec compared with insulin glargine U100. DEVOTE
demonstrated that in a treat-to-target trial design, insulin
degludec was non-inferior to insulin glargine in terms of car-
diovascular events and superior with regard to hypoglycaemia
risk, with lower rates of both severe and nocturnal severe
hypoglycaemia at equivalent glycaemic control [15]. Because
of the size and design of the trial and the relatively large number
of episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, DEVOTE provides a
valuable opportunity to explore the associations of severe
hypoglycaemia with cardiovascular outcomes and mortality.
Methods
The detailed methods of the trial, the trial protocol, the statis-
tical analysis plan and the list of members of the trial teams
and committees have been published previously [15, 16].
DEVOTE is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number
NCT01959529). The trial was conducted in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki and the ICH Good Clinical
Practice Guideline [17, 18]. The protocol was approved by
independent ethics committees or institutional review boards
for each centre; written informed consent was obtained from
each participant before any trial-related activities.
In brief, DEVOTE was a multicentre, prospective, treat-to-
target, randomised, double-blind, active comparator cardiovas-
cular outcomes trial, designed to continue until at least 633
major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), confirmed by
a central, blinded, independent Event Adjudication Committee
Diabetologia (2018) 61:58–65
59
 (EAC), had accrued [15, 16]. All participants had type 2 dia-
betes treated with at least one oral or injectable glucose-
lowering agent with HbA1c ≥ 7.0% (53 mmol/mol), or with
≥ 20 units/day of basal insulin. Patients were eligible for the
trial if they either had at least one co-existing cardiovascular or
renal condition and were aged ≥ 50 years or had at least one of a
list of pre-specified cardiovascular risk factors and were aged
≥ 60 years. Patients were not excluded if they had experienced
severe hypoglycaemia prior to randomisation.
Patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk of cardiovascular
events were randomised 1:1 to receive either insulin degludec
(Novo Nordisk, Bagsværd, Denmark) or insulin glargine
(Sanofi, Paris, France), in a blinded fashion, both in identical
100 U/ml, 10 ml vials, administered once daily between dinner
and bedtime, in addition to standard care. All patients were
allowed to continue their pre-trial glucose-lowering therapy,
with the exception of basal and premix insulins, which were
discontinued.
The primary adjudicated composite endpoint of DEVOTE
was the time from randomisation to the first occurrence of
death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal myocardial in-
farction or non-fatal stroke. Secondary outcomes included an
expanded composite cardiovascular outcome (the primary
composite endpoint plus adjudicated unstable angina leading
to hospitalisation) and time from randomisation to death from
any cause. Adjudication-confirmed severe hypoglycaemia
was a pre-specified, multiplicity-adjusted secondary outcome,
as defined by the ADA as an episode requiring the assistance
of another person to actively administer carbohydrate or glu-
cagon, or to take other corrective actions. Plasma glucose
levels may not be available during an event, but neurological
recovery after the return of plasma glucose to a normal level is
considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a
low plasma glucose level [19].
In the present analysis, the association between severe
hypoglycaemia and either MACE or all-cause mortality was
investigated by comparing the risk of an event with or without
having experienced severe hypoglycaemia in different time
periods (15, 30, 60, 90, 180 and 365 days) prior to the event.
Cox regression models were used to analyse these associa-
tions for each time period. The indicator of whether a severe
hypoglycaemic event had occurred was included in the model
as a time-dependent variable. All episodes of severe
hypoglycaemia prior to first MACE or all-cause mortality
were included in the analysis. Randomised treatment was also
included in the model as a fixed factor. For sensitivity analy-
ses, additional baseline information (age, sex, HbA1c, BMI,
diabetes duration, insulin regimen, hepatic impairment, renal
status and cardiovascular risk group inclusion criteria) was
accounted for. An investigation with interaction terms indicat-
ed that the effect of severe hypoglycaemia on the risk of
MACE and all-cause mortality were the same for both treat-
ment arms (insulin degludec and insulin glargine), and so the
temporal association for severe hypoglycaemia with subse-
quent MACE and all-cause mortality is reported for the pooled
population. For MACEs occurring on the same day as a severe
hypoglycaemic event, 0.5 days was added to the day of the
MACE. All analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4
(https://www.sas.com/en_ca/software/sas9.html). A p value of
< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Overall results from DEVOTE Detailed results from
DEVOTE have been published previously [15]. To summarise,
a total of 7637 patients were randomised to either insulin
degludec (n = 3818) or insulin glargine (n = 3819). Of these,
98% completed the final follow-up visit or died during the trial.
Vital status was known for 99.9% of participants. The median
observation time was 1.99 years in both treatment arms.
The pre-specified analysis demonstrated that insulin degludec
was non-inferior to insulin glargine in terms of cardiovascular
events (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78, 1.06; p < 0.001 for non-inferi-
ority), and superior with regard to hypoglycaemia risk, with a
lower rate of both severe and nocturnal severe hypoglycaemia
(by 40% and 53%, respectively; both p < 0.001) [15].
Severe hypoglycaemia and its association with cardiovas-
cular outcomes and all-cause mortality (secondary analy-
sis) Of the 681 patients who experienced a MACE and the 439
patients who experienced a severe hypoglycaemic event dur-
ing the trial, 32 patients had a severe hypoglycaemic event
prior to a MACE (14 patients treated with insulin degludec
and 18 patients treated with insulin glargine) and 16 patients
experienced a MACE prior to severe hypoglycaemia (Table 1
and Electronic supplementary material [ESM] Fig. 1). Of the
423 patients who died from any cause, 38 patients died after
experiencing a severe hypoglycaemic event (Table 1). The
baseline characteristics of participants who experienced se-
vere hypoglycaemia were not different from those who did
not experience severe hypoglycaemia during the trial (ESM
Table 1). There was no between-treatment difference in terms
of risk of MACE (p = 0.679) or all-cause mortality (p = 0.209)
following severe hypoglycaemia. On this basis, the associa-
tion between severe hypoglycaemia and time to first MACE
or all-cause mortality is reported for the pooled population.
In the pooled population, there was a non-significant dif-
ference in the risk of MACE between participants who had
and those who had not experienced severe hypoglycaemia
during the trial (HR 1.38, 95% CI 0.96, 1.96; p = 0.080)
(Fig. 1). A similar result was observed for the expanded
four-point MACE definition (HR 1.37, 95% CI 0.99, 1.91;
p = 0.060) (Fig. 1). When the individual components of the
three-point and four-point MACE were investigated, there
was a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular death at any
60

 time following a severe hypoglycaemic event vs not
experiencing a severe hypoglycaemic event (HR 2.14, 95%
CI 1.37, 3.35; p < 0.001), whereas there was not a significantly
higher risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction (HR 0.74, 95%
CI 0.36, 1.49; p = 0.395), non-fatal stroke (HR 1.81, 95% CI
0.92, 3.57; p = 0.085) or unstable angina requiring
hospitalisation (HR 1.34, 95% CI 0.59, 3.04, p = 0.490)
(Fig. 1). When dividing the time period following a severe
hypoglycaemic event into time intervals of different durations
(15, 30, 60, 90, 180 and 365 days), there was no temporal
relationship between severe hypoglycaemia and MACE
(Fig. 2). The non-significant relationship between severe
hypoglycaemia and MACE was maintained after adjustment
for the following baseline characteristics: age, sex, HbA1c,
BMI, diabetes duration, insulin regimen, hepatic impairment,
renal status and cardiovascular risk group inclusion criteria
(ESM Table 2). Only a small number of participants
experienced a MACE prior to severe hypoglycaemia
(n = 16) (Table 1), and therefore a possible opposite temporal
association could not be analysed. Only three nocturnal severe
hypoglycaemic events occurred prior to a MACE and there-
fore these could also not be analysed separately.
In the pooled population, experiencing severe hypoglycaemia
at any time was a significant predictor of all-cause mortality, as
the risk for these participants was 2.5-fold that for the participants
who did not experience an event (HR 2.51, 95% CI 1.79, 3.50;
p < 0.001) (Fig. 3). When dividing the time period following
severe hypoglycaemia into time intervals of different durations,
there was a higher risk of all-cause mortality 15, 30, 60, 90, 180
and 365 days after experiencing severe hypoglycaemia com-
pared with not experiencing severe hypoglycaemia in the same
time interval (Fig. 3). The risk appeared to be highest in the
shorter-term windows and decreased with the longer-term win-
dows, but remained significant for all (p < 0.05 for all). The
relationship between severe hypoglycaemia and all-cause mor-
tality was maintained after adjustment for the following baseline
characteristics: age, sex, HbA1c, BMI, diabetes duration, insulin
regimen, hepatic impairment, renal status and cardiovascular risk
group inclusion criteria (ESM Table 2). The cause of each death
occurring after a severe hypoglycaemic event is listed in ESM
Table 3, including the days the severe hypoglycaemic events
occurred and the time between the last event and the fatal event.
The majority of these fatal events were ascribed to non-
cardiovascular reasons (n = 17) and the remainder to cardiovas-
cular (n = 14) or undetermined causes (n = 7).
Discussion
The results of DEVOTE demonstrated that insulin degludec
was superior with regard to severe hypoglycaemia risk at
equivalent glycaemic control compared with insulin glargine,
thereby confirming observations from earlier studies includ-
ing the open-label Phase 3a programme and the double-blind,

 crossover SWITCH trial in patients with type 2 diabetes [12,
13, 15]. The results from the new analyses reported here dem-
onstrate an association between severe hypoglycaemic events
and a higher risk of all-cause mortality (p < 0.001) in the
overall DEVOTE population. In addition, the DEVOTE data
suggest that an elevated risk of a fatal event might persist for
many weeks and months after a severe hypoglycaemic event,
although the highest risk appears to be in the shorter time
periods, albeit with small numbers of events. The null hypoth-
esis for the temporal analyses was that there would be an
increased risk of an event immediately following severe
hypoglycaemia. On this basis we would therefore expect that
the ‘any time’ hazard ratio would be lower than those for the
shorter time periods, which is what was observed for all-cause
mortality. These results are similar to those observed in the
Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of
Cardiovascular Outcome Results (LEADER) trial, where a
similar temporal analysis was conducted [20].
Hypoglycaemia can have a number of adverse cardiovascular
pathological effects in addition to the symptomatic effects
experienced by patients. In healthy people, hypoglycaemia trig-
gers a counter-regulatory response with a subsequent increase in
catecholamine levels [21–24]. This response induces an increase
in myocardial contractility and cardiac output, with a corre-
sponding increase in elasticity of blood vessels and a reduction
in central arterial pressure [25–27]. People with a long duration
of diabetes may have arterial stiffness or underlying cardiac dis-
ease that can compromise the benefits of this counter-regulatory
response and lead to adverse outcomes. In an observational study
investigating the risk of arrhythmias during spontaneous
hypoglycaemia in people with type 2 diabetes at high risk of
cardiovascular events, clinically important hypoglycaemia
(< 3.5 mmol/l) was common, occurring 6% of the time [28].
These hypoglycaemic events were associated with ECG changes
consistent with ischaemia, prolonged QTintervals, repolarisation
defects and various cardiac arrhythmias, suggesting that these
events could be interconnected. Bradycardia and atrial and ven-
tricular ectopic counts were also significantly higher during ep-
isodes of nocturnal vs daytime hypoglycaemia [28].
Furthermore, animal studies have shown that the counter-

 regulatory sympathoadrenal response is capable of inducing fatal
cardiac arrhythmias during severe events [29].
Hypoglycaemia has also been linked to both prothrombotic
and proinflammatory effects, which could alter blood flow,
increasing the risk of cardiovascular events [21, 30]. The cat-
echolamines released during the counter-regulatory response,
as well as the release of coagulation factors and inflammatory
cytokines into the circulation, can all increase blood viscosity
and promote platelet aggregation and activation, thereby af-
fecting vascular flow [22, 29, 31, 32]. These proinflammatory
and procoagulant factors may remain elevated for several days
after the hypoglycaemia has resolved, leaving the person vul-
nerable for some time after the hypoglycaemic event, and
potentially contributing to the occurrence of major vascular
events [33, 34]. In a clinical setting, analyses from the
Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT) also demonstrated
that a severe hypoglycaemic event was an independent pre-
dictor of death at 90 days [19, 35].
There remains considerable controversy over the potential
causal relationship between severe hypoglycaemia and adverse
cardiovascular events. Several clinical outcome trials and obser-
vational studies have shown such an association [23]. In
ACCORD, patients who had one or more severe hypoglycaemic
episodes had higher rates of death than those who did not expe-
rience such episodes [6]. In the Outcome Reduction with Initial
Glargine Intervention (ORIGIN) trial, severe hypoglycaemia in-
creased the risk of arrhythmic death (by 77%), all-cause death
(by 74%) and cardiovascular death (by 71%) [36]. In addition, a
post hoc analysis of the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease:
PreterAx and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation
(ADV
ANCE) trial suggested that severe hypoglycaemia was as-
sociated with significantly higher risks for major macrovascular
events, cardiovascular death and all-cause death [37]. The major
limitation, however, is the inability to definitively attribute the
cause of death or cardiovascular event to hypoglycaemia and to
determine the exact temporal relationship between
hypoglycaemia and a subsequent vascular outcome. A recent
analysis of The Examination of Cardiovascular Outcomes with
Alogliptin Versus Standard of Care (EXAMINE) trial demon-
strated that the relationship between severe hypoglycaemia and
MACE was less strong for events occurring after a severe
hypoglycaemic event compared with all events and severe
hypoglycaemia, suggesting that confounding by comorbidities
and hypoglycaemia is important [38]. Indeed, in DEVOTE, the
trial population was at particularly high risk of MACE and fatal
events, with a long duration of diabetes (> 16 years) and previous
insulin use (85%), and the majority of participants with
established cardiovascular or chronic kidney disease (85%)
[15]. This is in line with other studies that have reported that
these patient characteristics were more common amongst those
who died following a severe hypoglycaemic event [39].
Similarly, results from a recent post hoc analysis of the
LEADER trial data have demonstrated a significantly higher risk
of MACE, cardiovascular death and non-cardiovascular death
following a severe hypoglycaemic event, particularly in the short
term. Those patients who experienced severe hypoglycaemia had
a longer duration of diabetes, greater insulin use and a higher
incidence of heart failure and kidney disease at baseline [20].
However, confounding by comorbidities does not appear to ac-
count for the association alone. A meta-analysis of several clin-
ical trials and observational studies, including over 900,000 pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes, observed that severe hypoglycaemia
was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, but
that this was unlikely to be entirely a consequence of confound-
ing by comorbid severe illness [7]. In addition, as described
above, there is also considerable experimental evidence that
hypoglycaemia can lead to arrhythmias and other adverse cardio-
vascular pathological effects. Overall, it is most likely that
hypoglycaemia is just a single contributory factor to cardiovas-
cular events in a much larger multifactorial landscape.
The analyses reported here have several limitations.
DEVOTE was designed to collect only severe hypoglycaemic
events and therefore the contribution of non-severe events
could not be assessed. There are several studies that show that
both non-severe and severe hypoglycaemic events are associat-
ed with a higher risk of cardiovascular events, hospitalisation
and all-cause mortality [40, 41]. Although DEVOTE did not
collect non-severe events, the severe events collected were in-
dependently adjudicated and provide an accurate view of these
events in an at-risk patient population. In addition, while the
overall DEVOTE trial population was large, only a small pro-
portion of patients experienced severe hypoglycaemia prior to a
MACE or a fatal event, particularly during the shorter time
periods (15–60 days), which limits the statistical power of our
time-to-event analysis. Furthermore, history of a patient’s pre-
vious experience of severe hypoglycaemia prior to the trial was
not collected, therefore the contribution of these events to the
risk of MACE or all-cause mortality could not be assessed. In
addition, it was observed from our analyses and those of other
trials that the association between a severe hypoglycaemic
event and a higher risk of a fatal event lasts for at least 1 year
[20]. It is therefore possible that with a population that mostly
used insulin prior to randomisation, confounding from severe
hypoglycaemic events prior to trial initiation could have oc-
curred. However, it is also important to note that approximately
30% of the DEVOTE population were on basal insulin alone
and 15% were insulin-naive at baseline, and therefore the rela-
tive risk of severe hypoglycaemia-induced cardiovascular
events in these populations is unlikely to be very high compared
with the risk for patients treated with a basal–bolus regimen.
Finally, the incorporation of a continuous glucose monitoring
element in future trials may also be warranted to provide further
information on blood glucose levels at the time of severe
hypoglycaemic events as well as up to the time of a MACE.
These analyses also have several strengths. DEVOTE is the
first cardiovascular outcomes trial to compare the cardiovascular

 safety of two basal insulins in a double-blind fashion. Many
previous cardiovascular outcome trials have been limited in their
potential to explore the relationship between hypoglycaemia and
MACE because the therapies used in the two treatment arms
were different and hence might have had differing pharmacolog-
ical influences on the risk of MACE. DEVOTE, a trial compar-
ing two basal insulins, allowed the effect of hypoglycaemia
alone to be explored more precisely. Furthermore, the indepen-
dent adjudication of both severe hypoglycaemic events and
MACE provided additional strength to the analyses.
The results from these analyses add to the evidence for an
association between severe hypoglycaemia and mortality.
However, they do not establish whether hypoglycaemia serves
as a risk marker for these events or directly contributes to their
occurrence.
