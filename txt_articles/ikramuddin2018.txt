IMPORTANCE The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is effective in achieving established diabetes
treatment targets, but durability is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To compare durability of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass added to intensive lifestyle
and medical management in achieving diabetes control targets.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Observationalfollow-upofarandomizedclinicaltrial
at4sitesintheUnitedStatesandTaiwan,involving120participantswhohadahemoglobinA1c
(HbA1c)levelof8.0%orhigherandabodymassindexbetween30.0and39.9(enrolledbetween
April2008andDecember2011)werefollowedupfor5years,endinginNovember2016.
INTERVENTIONS Lifestyle-intensive medical management intervention based on the Diabetes
Prevention Program and LookAHEAD trials for 2 years, with and without (60 participants
each) Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery followed by observation to year 5.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The American Diabetes Association composite triple end
point of hemoglobin A1c less than 7.0%, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol less than
100 mg/dL, and systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg at 5 years.
RESULTS Of 120 participants who were initially randomized (mean age, 49 years [SD, 8 years],
72 women [60%]), 98 (82%) completed 5 years of follow-up. Baseline characteristics were
similar between groups: mean (SD) body mass index 34.4 (3.2) for the lifestyle–medical
management group and 34.9 (3.0) for the gastric bypass group and had hemoglobin A1c levels
of 9.6% (1.2) and 9.6% (1.0), respectively. At 5 years, 13 participants (23%) in the gastric bypass
group and 2 (4%) in the lifestyle-intensive medical management group had achieved the
composite triple end point (difference, 19%; 95% CI, 4%-34%; P = .01). In the fifth year, 31
patients (55%) in the gastric bypass group vs 8 (14%) in the lifestyle–medical management
group achieved an HbA1c level of less than 7.0% (difference, 41%; 95% CI, 19%-63%; P = .002).
Gastric bypass had more serious adverse events than did the lifestyle–medical management
intervention, 66 events vs 38 events, most frequently gastrointestinal events and surgical
complications such as strictures, small bowel obstructions, and leaks. Gastric bypass had more
parathyroid hormone elevation but no difference in B12 deficiency.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In extended follow-up of obese adults with type 2 diabetes
randomized to adding gastric bypass compared with lifestyle and intensive medical
management alone, there remained a significantly better composite triple end point in the
surgical group at 5 years. However, because the effect size diminished over 5 years, further
follow-up is needed to understand the durability of the improvement.

orrecting the systemic disorder of type 2 diabetes to
reduce microvascular and cardiovascular risks
requires not only glycemic control but also manage-
ment of blood pressure and lipids.1 Clinical trials showing
improved glycemic control without improved cardiovascular
risk and pharmaceutical trials finding improved cardiovascu-
lar outcomes possibly unrelated to glycemic control have
both emphasized end points beyond blood glucose control.2
The value of a full range of clinical outcomes in treating dia-
betes has long been recognized by physicians and by the
American Diabetes Association.3
Weight loss improves the diabetes metabolic disorder,
but behavioral and pharmaceutical strategies have not been
broadly successful. With bariatric surgery, it became possible
to determine whether greater, more sustained weight loss
could improve diabetes treatment. Some observations sug-
gested that bariatric surgery might have salutary effects
independent of weight loss.4 Bariatric surgery has improved
controlled glycemia in recent randomized trials and was
associated with diabetes remission at 2 to 3 years.5-10 How-
ever, the positive effect on remission resulting from surgery
may wane with time.5,6,10,11
The Diabetes Surgery Study assesses the Roux-en-Y
gastric bypass effect on attainment of the 2008 American
Diabetes Association’
s (ADA’
s) composite triple end point for
diabetes of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <7.0%, low-density lipo-
protein cholesterol (LDL-C) less than 100 mg/dL, and systolic
blood pressure (BP)<130 mm Hg.12 To increase generalizabil-
ity, participants were enrolled from multiple sites with mul-
tiple treatment teams, including Taiwan.13 Participants had
poorly controlled diabetes and mild to moderate obesity.
All participants received intensive lifestyle intervention,
based on the Diabetes Prevention Program and LookAHEAD
Study, and intensive medical management for the first 2
years. Results at 1 year,12 2 years,14 and 3 years10 have been
published. Reported herein are the 5-year outcomes, focus-
ing on durability of composite end point treatment effects,
weight loss, diabetes remission, and adverse events.
Methods
The study was conducted at the University of Minnesota,
Columbia University Medical Center, National Taiwan Uni-
versity Hospital and Min Sheng General Hospital (together
called Taiwan), and the Mayo Clinic. Each site obtained
institutional review board approval and written informed
consent from each participant (the trial protocol is available
in Supplement 1).
The complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria has
been published.12 Briefly, key inclusion criteria included
HbA1c of 8.0% or higher despite having clinical care for at
least 6 months for type 2 diabetes; body mass index (BMI)
between 30.0 and 39.9, calculated as weight in kilograms
divided by height in meters squared; and stated willingness
and ability to accept randomization and follow the full treat-
ment protocol (Figure 1). Details of the recruitment efforts
are described elsewhere.13
Interventions
All participants were offered 2 years of lifestyle interven-
tion and intensive medical management. Participants
were randomized 1:1 (randomization details are described
elsewhere12) to receive gastric bypass in addition to lifestyle
and optimal medical treatment. Standardized Roux-en-Y
bypass was performed.12 The 2-year lifestyle intervention
was based on protocols from 2 successful clinical trials: the
Diabetes Prevention Program15 and the Look AHEAD study.16
Over the first year, the median number of lifestyle modules
delivered was 32 for the lifestyle–medical management group
and 27 for the gastric bypass group. Between years 1 and 2,
the median number of modules was 5 and 7, respectively.
Clinically important adverse event information was collected
at each visit.
During the 2-year intervention period, participants were
instructed to record weight, food intake, and daily exercise.
Participants in both groups were prescribed 325 minutes of
moderate-intensity physical activity per week and met regu-
larly with a trained interventionist to facilitate weight man-
agement. Visits with an endocrinologist occurred monthly
for 6 months, at least quarterly for the next 6 months, and
quarterly through the second year. The intensive medical
management protocol included the provision of a protocol-
based optimal drug therapy to control hyperglycemia, choles-
terol, and hypertension.
After2years,allstudy-supportedinterventionsceasedand
participants returned to usual care with their primary physi-
cian. Study endocrinologists evaluated participants during
clinic visits at 3, 4, and 5 years and obtained interim histories
of adverse events. Participants were encouraged to increase
medications, nutritional supplementation, and dietary con-
trol if adherence or vitamin and mineral deficiency were
deemed to be an issue. Prescriptions were written as neces-
sary. During years 3 to 5, study coordinators contacted par-
ticipantsmidyeartomaintaintheirconnectiontothestudyand
to obtain interim data on severe adverse events.
End Points
The primary outcome was attainment at the year-1 visit of a
prespecified composite outcome: simultaneous achieve-
ment of HbA1c of less than 7.0%, LDL-C of less than 100 mg/dL
Key Points
Question What are the 5-year outcomes of Roux-en-Y gastric
bypass compared with lifestyle and medical management in obese
adults with type 2 diabetes?
Findings This observational follow-up of a randomized clinical
trial that included 120 participants, 5 years after the intervention
found that significant improvement continued in a composite
outcome that included glycosylated hemoglobin level, low-density
lipoprotein level, and systolic blood pressure (23% vs 4%), but the
magnitude of difference decreased over time in follow-up.
Meaning Roux-en-Y gastric bypass maintained significant
differences from lifestyle and medical management in outcomes
after 5-year, but with diminishing effectiveness.

 (to convert cholesterol levels from mg/dL to mmol/L, multi-
ply by 0.0259), and systolic BP of less than 130 mm Hg. Sec-
ondary outcomes included durability of achieving the com-
posite triple end point and continuous measures of HbA1c,
LDL-C, and systolic BP; weight loss; high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C), diastolic BP, medication usage, and ad-
verse events.
Post hoc analyses were performed. Full diabetes remis-
sion was defined using the ADA consensus statement, which
required HbA1c levels of 6.0% at consecutive annual visits, and
no use of antihyperglycemic medication at either visit.17 The
partial diabetes remission definition replaced HbA1c levels of
6.0% with 6.5% at the same time points.17
This report at 5 years includes data on serious adverse
events, elevated parathyroid hormone, vitamin B12 deficien-
cies, and anemia. Queries regarding possible serious ad-
verse events (defined using standard US Food and Drug
Administration criteria) were part of every study visit and
telephone contact.
Statistical Analysis
Theprimaryeffectivenessanalyseswerebasedonanintention-
to-treat longitudinal mixed model.18 Secondary as-treated
analyses were carried out for key end points to elucidate re-
lationships between variables. A post hoc analysis of cross-
over participants was also performed.
A repeated-measures approach was used, using mixed
models with a random intercept for participant. The repeated-
measures approach uses all available follow-up data (includ-
ing unbalanced data) and treats missing data as missing at ran-
dom. All participants with at least 1 year of follow-up data are
reflected in the estimates.
Dichotomous outcomes were analyzed using longitudi-
nal logistic mixed models stratified by site; continuous out-
comes were analyzed using linear mixed models adjusted
for site. All models were adjusted for continuous baseline
values, as appropriate. For dichotomous outcomes, the esti-
mated log odds (95% CIs) for success were computed by SAS
PROC GLIMMIX. For each treatment group separately, per-
cent success and the upper and lower bounds for its 95% CI
were obtained by applying an inverse logit transformation
to the log odds supplied by PROC GLIMMIX. The estimated
treatment difference was computed as the percentile differ-
ence between estimates. Approximate 95% CIs for the esti-
mated percentile treatment difference were also computed
assuming that the probabilities for success in each treat-
ment group were independent, normally distributed ran-
dom variables, with standard error equal to the width of
their estimated 95% CIs divided by 2*1.96. A sensitivity test
was performed for site effects by treating site as a random
effect rather than as a fixed effect. Because fitted models
were used to report the outcomes, estimated counts for out-
come variables were computed as the estimated rate multi-
plied by the count of the base population, rounded to the
nearest integer.
Secondaryanalysesexcludedcrossoversinyears2to4and
categorized first-year crossovers based on their chosen treat-
ment, but otherwise used the same longitudinal mixed mod-
els as described above. Because the secondary analyses were
unadjusted for multiple comparisons, these analyses should
be interpreted as exploratory. Regressions were adjusted or
stratified for use of bariatric surgery (as treated) and site.
The Clopper-Pearson method19 (exact binomial CIs) was
used to examine remission in the lifestyle–medical manage-
ment group, where limited remissions made regressions un-
workable. Exact binomial methods were also used to test for
treatmentdifferencesinremissionrates,andforindicatorvari-
ables related to medication use.
Directly observed data for all 120 participants were in-
cluded in the analysis of adverse events and are reported on an
as treated basis. Recording of adverse events were as follows:
Years 1 and 2: clinically important events; year 3 through 5: all
serious adverse events. All serious adverse events are reported
based on years since randomization, including those for all

 participantswhowererandomizedtolifestyleandmedicalman-
agement but later elected to undergo gastric bypass surgery.
All analyses were conducted using SAS/STAT (2014, SAS
Institute Inc). All analyses were 2-sided and used a signifi-
cance threshold of .05.
Results
Between April 2008 and December 2011, 120 participants were
enrolledandwererandomized1:1toreceiveeitherthelifestyle–
medical management intervention alone (n = 60) or gastric by-
pass surgery plus the lifestyle intervention (n = 60). Exclud-
ing the 6 participants lost to follow-up prior to the 1-year visit
and the 1 participant who died of pancreatic cancer, 56 par-
ticipants in the lifestyle–medical management and 57 partici-
pants in the gastric bypass groups were included in the pri-
mary analysis (Figure 1). Baseline characteristics (Table 1) were
similar between groups except that insulin usage was lower in
thelifestyle–medicalmanagementgroup(43%)thaninthegas-
tric bypass (61%) group. A total of 11 participants crossed over
(Figure 1). Two participants randomized to gastric bypass de-
clined surgery but participated in the rest of the study. Nine
participants randomized to the lifestyle–medical manage-
ment group elected gastric bypass an average of 2 years after
randomization and remained in the study. Five-year data were
obtained from 43 participants (73%) randomized to lifestyle–
medical management and 55 participants (92%) randomized
to gastric bypass.
Primary End Point
In the first year after randomization, an estimated 28 partici-
pants (50%) in the gastric bypass group and 9 (16%) in the
lifestyle–medical management group achieved the compos-
ite triple end point (difference, 34%; 95% CI, 14%-54%;
P = .003). By 5 years, an estimated 13 participants (23%) in the
gastricbypassgroupand2(4%)intheoflifestyle–medicalman-
agement group achieved the composite triple end point (dif-
ference, 19%; 95% CI, 4%-34%; P = .01). Success in achieving
the primary end point was reduced in both groups from year 1
to year 3, from 50% to 23% in gastric bypass group and from
16% to 4% in lifestyle–medical management group), but re-
mained stable for years 3 through 5 (Table 2). There were no
material differences in fitted outcomes when site was treated
as a random effect rather than as a fixed effect. Results on an
as-treatedbasis(eTable2inSupplement2)weresimilar:14par-
ticipants (26%) who had surgery during the first year and 3 par-
ticipants (8%) who never had surgery achieved the triple end
point at 5 years (difference, 18%; 95% CI, 6%-32%; P = .04).
Components of the Primary End Point
At 5 years, an estimated 31 participants (55%) in the gastric by-
passgroupvs8participants(14%)inthelifestyle–medicalman-
agement group achieved HbA1c of less than 7.0% (difference,
41%; 95% CI, 19%-63%; P = .002; Table 2). Using directly ob-
served data over the 5 years of follow-up, 29 of the 42 partici-
pants in the gastric bypass group who had achieved an HbA1c
of less than 7.0% at 1 year maintained that treatment goal at 5
years. Among the lifestyle–medical management group, 7 of
the 18 who achieved the HbA1c goal at year 1 were still at goal
at year 5. For those participants achieving an HbA1c of less than
7.0% at year 1, the odds ratio (OR) of durability at 5 years vs 1
year was 0.25 (95% CI 0.09, 0.68) for gastric bypass vs 0.41
(95% CI, 0.14-1.25) for the lifestyle–medical management

130mmHginthegastricbypassgroupdroppedfrom89%(95%
CI, 78%-95%) to an estimated 42 participants (73%; 95% CI,

medical management group fell from 85% (95% CI, 71%-93%)
at 1 year to an estimated 27 participants (49%; 95% CI, 31%-
68%) at 5 years (Table 2). Recognizing the greater emphasis
being placed on individualized targets for diabetes manage-
ment, a goal of systolic BP of less than 140 mm Hg was also as-
sessed; 92% of gastric bypass and 86% of lifestyle–medical
management participants met that target at 5 years (OR, 1.92;
95%CI,0.47-7.91;nosignificantdifference;Table3).Therewas
a significant difference in achievement of LDL-C of less than
100 mg/dL only in the fifth year, estimated 44 (77%) in gas-

a For 113 patients (excluding 6 without 12-mo data and 1 who died), fitted values
were derived from a longitudinal mixed model that was adjusted for baseline
values and site. Treating patient as a random effect.
bFor dichotomous variables in years 1 through 5, the percent risk (95% CI) is
computed as the inverse logit of the estimated odds (95% CI). The percentile
difference in risks is the estimated treatment difference. The estimated
percentile difference is the difference in estimates. The estimated 95% CI for
percentile differences requires 2 additional assumptions: the within-group
estimated probability of success is normally distributed; and estimated
probabilities for IMM lifestyle vs Roux-en-Y gastric bypass are
statistically independent.
c Baseline values and 95% CIs were computed assuming normality. Odds ratios
(95% CIs) were computed using an unadjusted logistic regression and
compare Roux-en-Y against lifestyle and medical management.
dThe triple end point indicates simultaneous achievement of HbA1c
concentration of less than 7.0%, systolic BP of less than 130 mm Hg, and
LDL-C levels of less than 100 mg/dL.
e This article reports fitted values based on data from all 5 years, and thus differs
from what was reported in the first-year article, which was based on data
available at the time. Fitted values take into account missing data and are thus
consistent with an intent-to-treat analysis. The 5-year article is based on the
patients with 1-year visits, excluding 1 patient who died shortly after the year-1
visit. The longitudinal mixed model that formed the backbone for this article
modeled changes from the year-1 visit; it was not practical to include patients
without year-1 data. The 1-year article focused on early outcomes in the 120
randomized patients, using multiple imputation to fill in data for any missing
12-month visits. See eTable 2A for observed date in the Supplement 2.

 (95% CI, 8.3%-9.1%) in the lifestyle–medical management
group (Figure 2). The net treatment difference in HbA1c at 5
years was 1.6% (95% CI, 1.0%-2.2%; P < .001) lower HbA1c in
the gastric bypass group. Both groups had a substantial de-
crease in HbA1c in the first year, more so in the gastric bypass
group, followed by gradual rebounds that were nearly equal
between groups. Differences in fasting glucose levels (Table 4)
were observed at all time points between the 2 groups, for ex-
ample, a 41-mg/dL difference in year 1 and a 36-mg/dL differ-
ence in year 5. Both groups had some reduction of treatment
effect in years 2 and 3, followed by stable mean values in years
4 and 5.
Therewerenosignificantdifferencesinsystolicbloodpres-
sure over the 5 years (Figure 2). There were statistically sig-
nificant differences in mean LDL-C (Figure 2), HDL-C, and total
cholesterol levels and triglycerides in each case favoring the
gastric bypass group (Table 4). Differences emerged at 2 and 3
years for total cholesterol and LDL-C levels, respectively.
For the other lipids, differences were present at each year of
follow-up (Table 4).
Medications
At baseline, gastric bypass and lifestyle–medical manage-
ment participants required a mean (SD) number of medica-
tions of 4.1 (1.9) and 4.3 (1.5), respectively, to control glucose,
lipid levels, and blood pressure. At 5 years, medications for
the composite triple end point had been reduced to 2.0 in the
gastric bypass group compared with an increase to 4.4 in
the lifestyle–medical management group (difference, 2.4; 95%
CI, 1.7-3.0; P < .001). Insulin use was less common in the gas-
tric bypass group at 5 years than in the lifestyle–medical man-
agement group: 15% vs 37% (difference, 22%; 95% CI, 4%-
40%; P = .02), with similar differences in each previous year
of follow-up (Table 3). One participant randomized to the gas-
tric bypass group was later found to have adult-onset type 1
diabetes. At 5 years, noninsulin diabetes medications were
used in an estimated 24 participants (42%) in the gastric by-
pass group compared with 49 participants (88%) in the
lifestyle–medical management group (difference, 46%; 95%
CI, 29%-63%; P < .001; Table 4).
Estimated antihypertensive medication use was approxi-
mately 20 to 30 percentage points less in the gastric bypass
group at all time points, but not significantly different by the
fifth year. Use of dyslipidemia medications followed a pat-
tern similar to antihypertensive medications.
Weight Loss
At 5 years, participants in the gastric bypass group had a mean
weight loss of 21.8% vs 9.6% in lifestyle–medical manage-
ment group (difference, 12.2%; 95% CI, 8.9%-15.5%; Figure 3).
Weight loss in the gastric bypass was 26.1% at 1 year (95% CI,
23.8%-28.4%), and decreased to 21.8% at 5 years (95% CI,
19.5%-24.1%). By randomization assignment, the lifestyle–
medical management group mean weight loss increased from
7.8% at 1 year (95% CI, 5.5%-10.1%) to 9.6% at 5 years (95% CI,
7.2%-12.0%). In a post hoc analysis, crossovers in the first year
were categorized with their chosen treatment and crossovers
in later years were removed from the analysis. With these ad-
justments,cumulativepercentweightlossat5yearswas22.9%
(95% CI, 21.1%-24.8%) in gastric bypass and 6.3% (95% CI,
4.2%-8.4%) in the lifestyle–medical management group.
Diabetes Remission
Neither partial nor full remission occurred with the lifestyle–
medical management group at any time, except for 2 partici-
pants who elected gastric surgery during the third year
(Table 3). Partial remission, defined as an HbA1c level of less
than 6.5% at all visits for 1 year without taking any glycemic
medications,occurredinestimated21participants(35%)inthe

Adverse Events
Adverse events in years 1 to 3 were previously reported in
detail.10,14 Assigning complications as treated and including
crossovers in the as-treated group, the gastric bypass group ex-
perienced 16 additional adverse events from years 3 to 5 and
an additional 14 adverse events occurred among participants
who did not undergo gastric bypass, for a total of 66 and 38
eventsat5yearsineachgroup,respectively(Table5).Themost
common adverse events were 14 episodes of surgical compli-
cations in the gastric bypass group, and 15 and 16 gastrointes-
tinal events in the gastric bypass and lifestyle–medical man-
agement groups, respectively. Bone fractures had been
previously reported in the gastric bypass group but were not
seen in years 3 to 5. Details of the types of adverse events are
reported in eTable 4 in Supplement 2.
Parathyroid hormone, vitamin B12, and hemoglobin val-
ues were available at 5 years. Data were missing for 14 of 98
participants who had other 5-year data. For the remaining
84 participants, elevated parathyroid hormone was present
in 24 participants (46%) in the gastric bypass group and 6
(19%) in the lifestyle–medical management group (P = .02).
Vitamin B12 deficiency was present in 2 participants (4%) in
the gastric bypass group and 1 (3%) in the lifestyle–medical
management group. Three participants (6%) in the gastric
bypass group had anemia vs none in the lifestyle–medical
management group.
Crossover Data
Outcomes for participants who did not maintain their ran-
domization assignment for the duration of the study are sum-
marized in the appendix (eTable 3 in the Supplement 2). A total
of 9 of 60 participants (15%) randomized to the intensive medi-
cal management group elected to have bariatric surgery else-
where, 8 of whom elected to do so after the first year. Of those,
1 met the composite end point at 5 years. By 5 years, their mean
(SD) HbA1c concentration was 7.2% (1.3); LDL-C levels,
104 mg/dL (32 mg/dL); systolic BP, 127 mm Hg (24 mm Hg);
and percent weight loss, 22% (8.5%). In addition, 2 of 60

Discussion
In the 5-year follow-up, adding gastric bypass to intense life-
style and medical management continued to show improved
attainment of the triple diabetes end point goal. However, the
5-year results for gastric bypass of 23% and lifestyle plus in-
tense medical management of 4% maintaining the end point
goal were significantly lower than the first-year rates of 50%
and 16%. Most of the reduction in the proportion of partici-
pantsachievingtheprimaryendpointwasbetweenyears2and
3, after which the effects of both strategies remained rela-
tively constant. Although Roux-en-Y gastric bypass provided
significantbenefit,theoverallachievementwasmodestat23%
compared with averages ranging from 7% to 14% in the dia-
betes population.20-23
Because the key treatment goals for patients with diabe-
tes are the prevention of long-term complications,2 this triple
end point finding is important. Although the Diabetes Sur-
gery Study ideally would have been designed to study the car-
diovascular effects of gastric bypass in persons with diabe-
tes,thesizeandscoperequiredwasprohibitive.Poweranalyses
indicated that control of cardiovascular risk factors would be
an achievable target. The integrated triple end point provides
a more comprehensive view of changes in cardiovascular risk
than evaluations of each variable alone. With this broader goal,
the Diabetes Surgery Study aimed to test the value of adding
gastric bypass to intense diabetes management on preven-
tion of cardiovascular complications. The results indicate that
gastric bypass provides significant benefit but with a smaller

For Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, the 0
time point represents randomization.
For both groups, blue indicates that
the participant did not have bariatric
surgery. Two patients were
randomized to the Roux-en-Y gastric
bypass group and are represented
in blue based on their decision to
decline surgery. Orange indicates that
the participant did have bariatric
surgery (as-treated basis). Some
patients randomized to the intensive
medical management group later
obtained gastric bypass surgery
outside of the study. They are
reported on the intensive medical
management graph (based on
their randomization assignment),
but their line turns from blue
to orange at their approximate
surgery date.

 and less durable effect size than what is seen in the evalua-
tion of glycemic control alone.
Glycemic control at 5 years was significantly better in the
surgical group with HbA1c concentrations of less than 7.0%
achieved by 55% compared with 14% in lifestyle–medical man-
agement group. These achievement rates are higher than for
the primary composite triple end point but were also signifi-
cantly reduced from the corresponding 1-year values of 83%
in the surgical group and 29% in the lifestyle–medical man-
agement group. Because most participants had good baseline
control of blood pressure and LDL-C and because the treat-
ment effect on these variables was weaker, glycemic control
islikelytheprimarycontributortothesurgicalcompositetriple
end point improvement. Some participants may also benefit
from reductions in medications for glucose control, particu-
larly insulin, and hypertension. Better glucose control was the
primaryoutcomesoughtandobservedinothercontrolledtrials
of bariatric surgery for diabetes, and the rates of improve-
ment seen in this study are similar to those outcomes.5-9
Weight loss was durable in both groups. Following cessa-
tion of intensive lifestyle–medical management modification
at the end of 2 years, weight loss remained around 21% in the
surgical group and 6.3% in the lifestyle–medical manage-
ment group on an as-treated basis. These weight loss results
in both groups are similar to the weight loss seen at 5 years in
the single-site, single-surgeon STAMPEDE trial.6 Compared
with the current study, the single-site study in Italy found a
slightly greater amount of 5-year weight loss of 28.4% in the
gastric bypass, while the medical treatment group at 6.9% was
similar.5 A recent prospective observational study of patients
with diabetes who had undergone gastric bypass found a mean
weight loss of 28% at 6 years.24 The size of the treatment ef-
fectonweightappearsrelativelycomparableacrossthesestud-
ies, but the 2 studies with less weight loss, the Diabetes Sur-
gery Study and STAMPEDE study included participants with
higher baseline HbA1c values, possibly indicating that greater
diabetes-relatedillnesscouldlessengastricbypassweightloss.
Durability of weight loss in the both groups of the Diabe-
tes Surgery Study contrasts sharply with lack of durability in
metabolic control of diabetes. Weight loss was thought to be
one of the principal goals of the gastric bypass approach based
on expectations that weight loss would improve diabetes con-
trol, and some previous studies including earlier reports of the
Diabetes Surgery Study had shown weight loss as a predictor
of improved diabetes control.6,10 Worsening metabolic con-
trol over 5 years despite weight loss durability, particularly in
thegastricbypassgroupwithgreaterweightloss,indicatesthat
improvingdiabetescontrolforthelong-termmayinvolveother
factors,notablythehealthofpancreaticbetacells.25Theremay
have been insufficient beta cell function in some participants
to maintain long-term diabetes improvement. Whether such
a possibility supports earlier surgical intervention for diabe-
tes will need to be evaluated in other studies.
In evaluating the post hoc outcomes of either full or par-
tial remission, which occurred only in the surgical group, the
remission rates seen in this study at year 2 were reduced by
50%. At 5 years, 16% of participants had partial remission and
7% of participants had full remission. This partial remission
rate for gastric bypass was lower than the 37% rate at 5 years
in a single-site study with a treatment population of 20

 participantswithabaselineHbA1cconcentrationof8.7%ineach
group, but that study also found no full remissions at 5 years.5
A recent report from the STAMPEDE trial found partial remis-
sion rate in 30.6% and full remission in 22.4% 5 years follow-
ing gastric bypass.6 Accounting for these differences is uncer-
tain, but the Diabetes Surgery Study was different from other
surgical diabetes treatment studies in severity of pretreat-
ment diabetes, with baseline HbA1c concentration of 9.6%, and
the multisite program with participation of several racial/
ethnic groups.
It is important to consider the adverse events associated
with surgical treatment. There were 104 total adverse events
through 5 years. On an as-treated basis, there were 66 in the
gastric bypass group and 38 in the lifestyle–medical manage-
ment group. Surgical complications were among the most
common adverse events in the gastric bypass group, includ-
ing 1 complication that occurred in year 5. Surgical complica-
tions included 1 catastrophic outcome, a cerebrovascular
event. Malabsorptive complications were also more common
among in the gastric bypass group. Significant elevations of
parathyroid hormone were observed among participants in
the gastric bypass group, potentially indicating a long-term
negative effect on bone health. The earlier report about
increased fractures in the gastric bypass group was not
observed beyond 3 years. Although B12 deficiency is a com-
mon concern after gastric bypass, B12 deficiency was not dif-
ferent between the 2 groups, suggesting effective supple-
mentation, in accordance with the study protocol. Overall,
adverse events and nutritional deficiencies were seen in sub-
stantially greater numbers in the gastric bypass group
through 5 years.
Strengths of the study include generalizability conveyed
by larger group sizes than previous randomized studies of gas-
tric bypass for diabetes,5-9 the participation of multiple sites
and surgeons, and greater range of race/ethnic groups includ-
ing an East Asian cohort. More than 50% of the participants
had an initial BMI less than 35, further improving generaliz-
ability. In addition, the primary end point incorporated the full
range of established diabetic treatment goals instead of glu-
cose control alone.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. The mean baseline HbA1c
concentration of 9.6% indicates that this was a group of par-
ticipants with relatively poorly controlled glycemia, so
whether the results would be different with better controlled
glycemia at baseline cannot be determined. Similarly, the
participants had diabetes for a mean of 9 years at study entry,
so treatment effect on diabetes of lesser duration could be
different. Conversely, blood pressure and LDL-C levels were
relative well controlled among the study participants, so it is
possible that individuals with less control might receive
greater treatment benefit. Follow-up was incomplete (82% at
5 years), creating an opportunity for bias. Statistical analyses
assumed missing data were missing at random, which may
not have been true. Crossovers, which were analyzed on an
intention-to-treat basis, may have reduced observed treat-
ment differences. The study tested a single type of bariatric
surgery, the gastric bypass procedure which was most com-
mon at study initiation, so whether these conclusions apply
to other surgical approaches will have to be assessed.
Conclusions
In extended follow-up of obese adults with type 2 diabetes ran-
domized to adding gastric bypass compared with lifestyle–
medical management and intensive medical management
alone, there remained a significantly better composite triple
end point in the surgical group at 5 years. However, because
the effect size diminished over 5 years, further follow-up is
needed to understand the durability of the improvement.
