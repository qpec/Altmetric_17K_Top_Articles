Abstract
Background
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in India. Yet, evidence on
the CVD risk of India’s population is limited. To inform health system planning and effective
targeting of interventions, this study aimed to determine how CVD risk—and the factors that
determine risk—varies among states in India, by rural–urban location, and by individual-
level sociodemographic characteristics.
Methods and findings
We used 2 large household surveys carried out between 2012 and 2014, which included a
sample of 797,540 adults aged 30 to 74 years across India. The main outcome variable was
the predicted 10-year risk of a CVD event as calculated with the Framingham risk score.
The Harvard–NHANES, Globorisk, and WHO–ISH scores were used in secondary analy-
ses. CVD risk and the prevalence of CVD risk factors were examined by state, rural–urban
residence, age, sex, household wealth, and education. Mean CVD risk varied from 13.2%
(95% CI: 12.7%–13.6%) in Jharkhand to 19.5% (95% CI: 19.1%–19.9%) in Kerala. CVD risk
tended to be highest in North, Northeast, and South India. District-level wealth quintile
(based on median household wealth in a district) and urbanization were both positively

 associated with CVD risk. Similarly, household wealth quintile and living in an urban area
were positively associated with CVD risk among both sexes, but the associations were
stronger among women than men. Smoking was more prevalent in poorer household wealth
quintiles and in rural areas, whereas body mass index, high blood glucose, and systolic
blood pressure were positively associated with household wealth and urban location. Men
had a substantially higher (age-standardized) smoking prevalence (26.2% [95% CI: 25.7%–
26.7%] versus 1.8% [95% CI: 1.7%–1.9%]) and mean systolic blood pressure (126.9 mm
Hg [95% CI: 126.7–127.1] versus 124.3 mm Hg [95% CI: 124.1–124.5]) than women. Impor-
tant limitations of this analysis are the high proportion of missing values (27.1%) in the main
outcome variable, assessment of diabetes through a 1-time capillary blood glucose mea-
surement, and the inability to exclude participants with a current or previous CVD event.
Conclusions
This study identified substantial variation in CVD risk among states and sociodemographic
groups in India—findings that can facilitate effective targeting of CVD programs to those
most at risk and most in need. While the CVD risk scores used have not been validated in
South Asian populations, the patterns of variation in CVD risk among the Indian population
were similar across all 4 risk scoring systems.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is thought to cause a large and increasing health and eco-
nomic burden in India.
• Understanding how CVD risk varies among India’s population groups could inform
health system planning and the targeting of CVD programs to those most in need.
• Yet, to date, there has not, to our knowledge, been a large-scale population-based study
that examines how CVD risk varies among India’s states and sociodemographic groups.
What did the researchers do and find?
• This analysis pooled data from 797,540 participants aged 30 to 74 years across 2 large
population-based household surveys, which jointly covered 27 of 29 states and 5 of 7
union territories in India.
• The average 10-year risk of a fatal or nonfatal CVD event varied widely among states in
India, ranging from 13.2% in Jharkhand to 19.5% in Kerala.
• In addition, adults living in urban areas, as well as those with a higher household wealth
or education, tended to have a greater CVD risk.

 What do these findings mean?
• This study identified important variation in composite CVD risk (as well as in the prev-
alence of individual CVD risk factors) among India’s population, which can inform
effective targeting of CVD programs to those most at risk and most in need.
• While the absolute CVD risk levels predicted by any 1 of the 4 CVD risk calculators we
used should be interpreted with caution (because of the absence of CVD risk equations
that have been validated among South Asian populations), the relative variation of CVD
risk among India’s population groups was similar across all 4 risk calculators.
Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality worldwide, including in low-
and middle-income countries [1]. While the Global Burden of Disease project has recently
highlighted the limited data availability for India [2], it nonetheless estimated that the country
contributed almost one-fifth (18.6%) of the global CVD burden, as measured by disability-
adjusted life years, in 2016 [3]. Although this proportion is only slightly above the share of the
world’s population that lives in India (17.7% in 2015) [4], it is likely to increase in the future
for 3 main reasons. First, India is expected to make the greatest contribution to global popula-
tion growth of any country until at least 2050 [5]. Second, India’s population is aging and
urbanizing: the share of people aged more than 60 years is estimated to double from 8.9% to
19.4% between 2015 and 2050 [5], and the percentage of Indians living in cities is projected to
grow from 30.9% in 2010 to 50.3% in 2050 [6]. Third, the rise in living standards and socio-
cultural transitions in India are likely to lead to more obesogenic lifestyles [7]. Evidence indi-
cates that urban South Asians, especially those living in North America and Western Europe,
have a higher prevalence of CVD and type 2 diabetes than local white populations [8–10].
While the reasons for this phenomenon are not clear (although some explanatory models have
been proposed in the literature) [10,11], this susceptibility for CVD among South Asians living
in urban, high-income settings suggests that increasing urbanization and the spread of obeso-
genic environments might raise the prevalence of CVD even more in India (and South Asia in
general) than it has already in other world regions.
Given the detrimental effects of CVD on health outcomes [12], financial risk protection
[13], and economic growth [14], the course of India’s CVD epidemic will directly impact sev-
eral Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These include SDG 1 (“End poverty in all its
forms everywhere”) and SDG 3 (“Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all
ages”) as well as their corresponding targets SDG 3.4 (“By 2030, reduce by one-third premature
mortality from NCDs [noncommunicable diseases]”) and SDG 3.8 on achieving universal
health coverage. Considering the size and growth of India’s population [5], the development of
its CVD epidemic over the next decade will also have a decisive impact on the world’s ability
to achieve the SDGs [15].
Many studies have focused on providing the best possible prevalence estimates for CVD
and its risk factors at the national level in India [16–19]. However, much less is known about
the distribution of these risk factors within India—both geographically and by individuals’
sociodemographic characteristics. Given that India’s health system is largely decentralized to
the state level [20], understanding the variation of CVD risk within India is highly relevant not

 only to identify target groups for CVD prevention, screening, and treatment programs but also
for health system planning at the state and district level. Using data from a sample of 797,540
adults aged 30–74 years, this study therefore aimed to determine how CVD risk varies by geog-
raphy and individual-level sociodemographic characteristics across India.
Methods
Data sources
We pooled data from 2 large household surveys in India, the District Level Household Survey–
4 (DLHS-4) and the second update of the Annual Health Survey (AHS), both of which were
conducted between 2012 and 2014. These 2 surveys were combined because they (i) jointly
covered most states (27 of 29) and union territories (5 of 7) of India (and no areas in India
were covered by both surveys), (ii) were conducted simultaneously, (iii) are both representa-
tive at the district level, and (iv) used the same questionnaire and methodology to collect clini-
cal, anthropometric, and biomarker (CAB) measurements. The states covered by each of the
surveys are shown in Fig A in S1 Fig.
In both surveys, all non-pregnant household members aged 18 years and older were eligible
for blood glucose, blood pressure (BP), height, and weight measurements. The analyses in this
study were restricted to those aged 30 to 74 years because the CVD risk equations used in this
study were developed among adults of this age range only [21–23]. Body mass index (BMI)
was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. Participants’
blood glucose was measured using a capillary blood sample (from a finger prick) taken using a
handheld blood glucose meter (SD CodeFree), which multiplied capillary blood glucose read-
ings by 1.11 to display their plasma equivalent [24]. Participants were instructed to fast for at
least 8 hours before the time of the measurement. BP was measured twice, with each measure-
ment 10 minutes apart, using an electronic upper arm BP monitor (Rossmax AW150).
All data collectors for the AHS and DLHS-4 were trained in the collection of sociodemo-
graphic as well as the CAB data. In the AHS and DLHS-4, training sessions were organized for
12–15 and 15–20 data collectors at a time, respectively. Trainings for anthropometric and bio-
marker measurements lasted for 7 days, with 4 days of training conducted in the classroom
and 3 days in the field. The following mechanisms were put in place for both the AHS and
DLHS-4 to ensure good data quality: (i) establishment of standard protocols for questionnaire
administration, anthropometry, BP measurement, and blood glucose measurement, (ii) the
field supervisor conducted a second CAB measurement on 10% of participants each day to
identify poor-quality measurements, (iii) a medical consultant (who received additional train-
ing for the CAB component) visited 10% of all sampled households and conducted a second
CAB assessment to identify poor-quality measurements, (iv) continuous data monitoring by
the implementing organization, (v) immediate replacement of faulty equipment, and (vi) regu-
lar checks of the accuracy of digital BP monitors and the handheld blood glucometers. More
details on the data collection procedures can be found in the CAB manuals of the AHS and
DLHS-4 [25,26]. The documents can be obtained from the corresponding author.
Sampling procedure
The AHS and DLHS-4 jointly cover all 29 states of India apart from Jammu and Kashmir
(where data were not collected due to violent conflicts) and Gujarat (where data were not avail-
able in the public domain). The datasets also include all union territories of India except
Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and Lakshadweep. The 2 states and 2 union territories not included
in this analysis accounted for 6% of India’s population at the time of the last census (2011)
[27].

 Annual health survey.
Carried out between 2012 and 2013, the AHS covered all 284 dis-
tricts in 9 states of India that were selected for the AHS because they had the highest rate of
infant and child mortality in the country in 2010 [28]. These states accounted for 48% of the
country’s population in 2011 [27]. The AHS employed a self-weighting 2-stage cluster random
sampling design (stratified by rural versus urban) in each district, whereby primary sampling
units (PSUs) were villages in rural areas and census enumeration blocks in urban areas. Sec-
ondary sampling units (SSUs) were households. PSUs were selected through simple random
sampling with probability proportional to population size (using projections from the 2001
India Census). After all households in a PSU were enumerated, households were selected
using systematic random sampling (with an interval of 2) whereby the first household in each
PSU was selected randomly, and then every alternate (third, fifth, seventh, etc.) household was
selected, for blood glucose, BP, height, and weight measurements. These measurements were
taken 12 to 18 months after administration of a questionnaire, which asked about the same
participants’ sociodemographic information, including treatment for diabetes and hyperten-
sion as well as smoking history. Thus, the sociodemographic and CAB information were col-
lected at 2 different time-points, and both were only collected once. We merged the dataset
containing participants’ sociodemographic information with the dataset containing their
anthropometric, BP, and blood glucose measurements as described in Text A in S1 Text.
District level household survey–4.
Carried out between 2012 and 2014, the DLHS-4 cov-
ered all 336 districts in 18 states and 5 union territories (henceforth also referred to as “states”)
of India, which jointly accounted for 46% of India’s population at the time of the 2011 census
[27,28]. The DLHS-4 used 2-stage cluster random sampling (stratified by urban versus rural).
PSUs were “census villages” in rural areas and “urban frame survey blocks” in urban areas;
SSUs were households. Rural PSUs were selected with probability proportional to population
size, and urban PSUs through simple random sampling. SSUs were selected using systematic
random sampling. A more detailed description of the sampling procedure is available in the
DLHS-4 state reports [29].
Ethics
This analysis of an existing dataset in the public domain received a determination of “not
human subjects research” by the institutional review board of the Harvard T.H. Chan School
of Public Health on 23 November 2016 (protocol number: IRB16-1915). All participants pro-
vided written informed consent to participate in the AHS and DLHS-4.
Outcome variables
Throughout this analysis, we used the predicted 10-year risk of a CVD event to summarize
CVD risk as computed by risk calculators across different risk factors. However, we also “dis-
aggregated” predicted CVD risk by examining the geographic and sociodemographic variation
of each of the risk factors included in these risk calculators: (i) BMI, (ii) high blood glucose,
(iii) systolic BP, and (iv) smoking. Results on diastolic BP are presented in supplementary files
for completeness (Figs D and G in S1 Fig).
We primarily used continuous predicted 10-year CVD risk as an outcome. However, in sec-
ondary analyses, we dichotomized predicted 10-year risk of a CVD event into high and low
risk whereby “high CVD risk” was defined as a 10-year CVD risk � 30%. This threshold was
chosen because it is the cutoff used in the World Health Organization’s NCD Global Action
Plan targets to decide who is eligible for drug therapy and counseling [30]. We primarily used
the Framingham risk score (the version not requiring total cholesterol measurements) to cal-
culate CVD risk because it is the most widely used CVD risk scoring system internationally

 [21,31]. However, in secondary analyses, we also show results using CVD risk calculated with
3 other risk scores that do not require blood lipid measurements, namely Harvard–NHANES
[23], Globorisk [32], and the risk score developed by WHO and the International Society for
Hypertension (WHO–ISH) [33]. None of these risk scores have been validated among South
Asian populations. Because data on participants’ medical history were unavailable, we did not
exclude participants with a previous or current CVD.
All 4 risk scores used predict the risk of a fatal or nonfatal CVD event, but each score
defines a CVD event differently (Table 1). The Framingham risk score uses the broadest [21],
and Globorisk [32] and WHO–ISH [33] the narrowest, range of CVD events as outcome. The
Globorisk project has calibrated its risk equation to 182 countries, including India, as
described by Ueda et al. [32]. Similarly, WHO has calibrated its risk score to each WHO sub-
region [33]. The Framingham and Harvard–NHANES risk scores were calibrated to India
using the incidence rate (by 5-year age group) of peripheral artery disease (Framingham only),
ischemic heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease in 2015 as estimated by the Global Burden
of Disease project [12].
The 4 risk scores predict CVD risk by sex using the following inputs: age, BMI (except
WHO–ISH), presence of diabetes (except the office-based version of the Globorisk score),
current smoking, systolic BP, and treatment for hypertension (except Globorisk and
WHO–ISH). Diabetes was defined as having a blood glucose �7.0 mmol/l if reporting to
have fasted or �11.1 mmol/l if reporting not to have fasted, or reporting to be on regular
treatment for diabetes. Because the survey only measured blood glucose to assess diabetes,
which is insufficient for a clinical diagnosis of this condition, we refer to this outcome as
“high blood glucose” for the remainder of the paper. For systolic BP, we used the average of
the 2 systolic BP readings recorded.
Explanatory variables
Explanatory variables were household wealth quintile, education, and whether the household
was located in a rural or urban area. We used a principal component analysis to create a house-
hold wealth index based on 5 key housing characteristics (water supply, type of toilet and
whether it is shared, cooking fuel, housing material, and source of lighting) and household
ownership of 12 assets (radio, TV, computer, phone, refrigerator, bicycle, scooter, car, washing
machine, sewing machine, house, and land). The first component in the principal component
analysis (using the methodology developed by Filmer and Pritchett [34,35]) was used to com-
bine these variables into a single measure, separately for urban and rural areas. This index was
then divided into quintiles (again, separately for rural and urban areas) based on the distribu-
tion in the national (aggregate) dataset.

 Statistical analysis
CVD risk was computed for each study participant aged 30 to 74 years. Using sampling
weights to account for the complex survey design, we then calculated the mean 10-year CVD
risk at the national level, by state, and by individual-level sociodemographic characteristics. All
mean risk values (and prevalence estimates) are unadjusted for individuals’ sociodemographic
characteristics (other than age standardization where explicitly indicated). In addition, we
used ordinary least squares regressions to regress the natural logarithm of the CVD risk score
on sociodemographic characteristics and a fixed effect for district (i.e., a binary indicator for
each district to adjust for unobserved differences between districts). The natural logarithm of
CVD risk was used in all regression models to allow for a more intuitive interpretation of the
regression coefficients as percentage changes in CVD risk. The regressions were run separately
for males and females because each CVD risk score provides sex-specific risks. Two different
regression models were fitted for each CVD risk score (except WHO–ISH because it only pro-
vides risk categories rather than a continuous risk variable [33]) and sex: (i) a model that
included only 1 sociodemographic characteristic, age group, and a district-level fixed effect
and (ii) a model that included all sociodemographic characteristics and a district-level fixed
effect as explanatory variables. Standard errors were adjusted for clustering at the level of the
PSU. The mean (for BMI and systolic BP) or the prevalence (for high blood glucose and smok-
ing) of each CVD risk factor was plotted by state and sociodemographic characteristics to help
explain observed patterns in the CVD risk scores.
This study did not have a prospective analysis plan. The analysis outlined above was con-
ceived by the authors prior to embarking on data analysis. None of the analyses were
unplanned with the exception that reviewer comments led us to add (i) additional maps to
examine state-level variation (specifically, to stratify variation not only by sex but also by age
group and rural–urban residence) and (ii) multi-level modeling to examine the association of
CVD risk with district-level wealth and urbanization. Regarding the latter, the peer reviewer
comments prompted us to further investigate area-level predictors of CVD risk because we
identified wide geographic variation in CVD risk in our initial analysis. To do so, we computed
a measure of district-level wealth by calculating (separately for rural and urban areas within
districts because household wealth was also computed separately for rural and urban areas) the
median of the continuous household wealth index in a district, and then categorizing the dis-
trict-level median into quintiles (henceforth referred as “district wealth quintiles”). Another
potential area-level predictor that we examined was the level of urbanization of a district
assessed through the proportion of participants in a district who were residing in an urban
area. These 2 area-level predictors were chosen because they could be calculated directly from
the data. We, thus, did not have to rely on the accuracy of other data sources, and—unlike
other indicators—these district-level indicators were automatically available for all districts in
the sample for the time of the survey. The association of these 2 district-level predictors with
CVD risk were studied using a multivariable linear regression model with the natural loga-
rithm of 10-year CVD risk as the dependent variable, random intercepts by district, and indi-
vidual-level sociodemographic characteristics (5-year age group, sex, educational attainment,
and household wealth quintile) as independent variables.
We conducted a complete case analysis for all analyses presented in this paper. The Global
Burden of Disease project’s 2013 population for India was used for age standardization [36].
This study is reported as per STROBE guidelines (S1 Checklist). Statistical analyses were run
in R version 3.3.2 (2016) [37], and the WHO–ISH score was calculated using the whoishRisk
package [38].

Sample characteristics
Sociodemographic information was available for a total of 1,094,754 adults aged 30–74 years,
which included individuals who were not present at the time of the household visit (as sociode-
mographic information was collected for all household members from the household head). In
total, 797,540 (72.9% [797,540/1,094,754]) survey participants who had all the values for the
variables needed to calculate each CVD risk score (i.e., blood glucose, systolic BP, height and
weight, age, sex, and smoking status) were included in the analysis. While mean BMI was simi-
lar between males and females (22.6 kg/m2 and 22.3 kg/m2, respectively), females were more
likely to have BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 or BMI � 25 kg/m2 than males (Table 2). In all, 10.0%
(42,066/420,691) of females and 10.7% (40,444/376,849) of males had high blood glucose.
Smoking prevalence and mean systolic BP were higher among men than women (27.1%
[102,182/376,849] versus 2.6% [10,992/420,691] and 129.1 mm Hg versus 126.7 mm Hg,

 respectively). In all, 56.2% (236,555/420,691) of females and 34.0% (128,183/376,849) of males
had not completed primary school, and approximately one-third of participants lived in urban
areas. Table A in S1 Table shows that those who were excluded from the analysis (27.1% of par-
ticipants) because they had a missing value for at least 1 of the variables needed to calculate
predicted CVD risk had a similar prevalence of CVD risk factors as those who were included
in the analysis.
Cardiovascular risk at the national level
Overall, the mean 10-year risk of a CVD event in the (not age-standardized) population aged
30–74 years was 12.7% (95% CI: 12.7%–12.8%) among females and 21.4% (95% CI: 21.3%–
21.6%) among males (Table B in S1 Table). The (not age-standardized) prevalence of a high
CVD risk (10-year risk � 30%) in those aged 30 to 74 years was 14.6% (95% CI: 14.4%–14.8%)
among females and 31.7% (95% CI: 31.4%–32.0%) among males. The Framingham risk score
yielded similar risk estimates to Harvard–NHANES, but substantially higher estimates than
Globorisk and WHO–ISH (Table C in S1 Table). As an alternative measure of need for treat-
ment and counseling to reduce CVD risk, we show the (not age-standardized) proportion of
participants who were current smokers, had a high blood glucose, had hypertension, or were
overweight in Table D in S1 Table.
Geographic variation of cardiovascular risk
The age-standardized state-level mean 10-year CVD risk (across all age groups) varied from
10.2% (95% CI: 9.8%–10.7%) among females in Assam to 24.2% among males in Nagaland

 (95% CI: 23.5%–25.0%) and Himachal Pradesh (95% CI: 23.6%–24.9%) (Fig 1). Similarly, the
age-standardized prevalence of a high CVD risk varied from 5.0% (95% CI: 4.5%–5.6%)
among females in Assam to 30.4% (95% CI: 28.8%–32.0%) among males in Kerala (Fig B in S1
Fig). Among both males and females, CVD risk tended to be highest in South India (including
Goa), the 3 most northern states in the dataset (Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, and Uttarakhand),
the northeastern states (except Assam), and West Bengal (particularly among males). This pat-
tern across states, as well as the wide degree of variation in CVD risk between states, largely
remained when examining state-level prevalence within only certain age groups (Fig 2) and
within rural and urban areas (Fig 3). While the absolute risk levels depended strongly on the
choice of CVD risk calculator, the relative variation across states was similar regardless of the
CVD risk score used (Fig C in S1 Fig).
Fig 4 shows differences between states in the age-standardized mean (for BMI and systolic
BP) or prevalence (for high blood glucose and smoking) for each of the CVD risk factors that
are included in the CVD risk score. Mean BMI was high in both northern (Haryana, Himachal
Pradesh, Punjab, and Uttarakhand) and southern states (Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Karnataka,
Kerala, Tamil Nadu), ranging from 22.8 kg/m2 among males in Uttarakhand to 25.1 kg/m2
among females in Punjab. High blood glucose prevalence, however, was relatively low in the
northern states (ranging from 4.4% among males in Himachal Pradesh to 10.9% among
females in Punjab). Mean systolic BP was highest in the northern states (ranging from 123.7
mm Hg among females in Haryana to 136.2 mm Hg among males in Punjab) as well as in
Nagaland and Sikkim (130.7 mm Hg and 132.8 mm Hg among females and 133.6 mm Hg and

 133.1 mm Hg among males, respectively). Smoking was most prevalent among males in the
northeastern states of Arunachal Pradesh (46.4%), Manipur (60.3%), Meghalaya (59.7%), and
Mizoram (71.7%) and the eastern state of West Bengal (49.5%). As with the CVD risk score,
these patterns across states and the wide variation between states remained when examining
the state-level distribution of these variables only within certain age groups and within rural
and urban areas (Fig D in S1 Fig).
Socioeconomic drivers of geographic variation in cardiovascular risk
We found a positive association between the mean CVD risk in a district and the district’s
wealth when plotting the district-level mean Framingham risk score against the district-level
median (categorized into quintiles) of the continuous household wealth index (Fig 5). Simi-
larly, mean CVD risk was positively associated with the proportion of the sample in a district
that was living in an urban area (Fig 6).
Confirming the impression from the plotting of our data in Figs 5 and 6, our multivariable
linear regressions revealed that district wealth quintile was positively associated with CVD risk
in both rural and urban areas, with the association stronger in rural areas (Table 3). Specifi-
cally, among participants residing in rural areas, living in the wealthiest 20% of districts in
India was associated with a relative increase in the 10-year CVD risk of 13.1% (95% CI: 10.7%–
15.6%; p < 0.001) compared to the poorest 20% of districts. In urban areas, the corresponding
increase was only 4.3% (95% CI: 1.5%–7.1%; p = 0.003). In addition, as shown in Table 4, living
in an entirely urbanized district was associated with a relative increase in the 10-year CVD risk
of 16.9% (95% CI: 12.7%–21.1%; p < 0.001) compared with living in an entirely rural district.
Fig 5. Association between the age-standardized district-level mean 10-year cardiovascular disease risk and district wealth quintile. Mean 10-year risk of a
cardiovascular disease (CVD) event was calculated using the Framingham risk score. District wealth quintile was calculated, separately for rural and urban areas within
districts, by computing the median of the continuous household wealth index in a district and then categorizing the district-level median into quintiles. Age
standardization was to the Global Burden of Disease project’s 2013 population structure for India [36]. The sample in each district was restricted to those aged 30 to 74
years. States and districts were divided into regions as per their allocation to Zonal Councils by the Government of India [39]. The whiskers of the box and whisker

 The associations shown in Tables 3 and 4 were similar regardless of the CVD risk calculator
used (Tables G–J in S1 Table).
Cardiovascular risk by individual-level sociodemographic characteristics
Stratifying mean 10-year CVD risk by age group, sex, rural versus urban location, and house-
hold wealth quintile shows that (i) those living in urban areas generally had a higher CVD risk
than those living in rural areas, (ii) irrespective of sex and location, mean CVD risk was higher
in the wealthiest than in the poorest quintile in all age groups (except the youngest age group),

disease (CVD) event was calculated using the Framingham risk score. Urbanization refers to the district-level percentage of adults aged 30 to 74 years in our sample who
were living in an urban area. Age standardization was to the Global Burden of Disease project’s 2013 population structure for India [36]. The sample in each district was
restricted to those aged 30 to 74 years. States and districts were divided into regions as per their allocation to Zonal Councils by the Government of India [39]. The grey
line was fitted using ordinary least squares regression (with each data point in the plot having the same weight).

 and (iii) both the relative and absolute differences in mean CVD risk between wealth quintiles
tended to be larger in rural than in urban areas (Fig 7). These patterns were generally similar
when using Harvard–NHANES or Globorisk (WHO–ISH does not yield a continuous risk
score) instead of the Framingham risk score (Fig E in S1 Fig), and when examining the preva-
lence of a high 10-year CVD risk (�30%) as opposed to mean CVD risk (Fig F in S1 Fig).
Table 5 shows the regression coefficients (which can be interpreted as approximations of
the percentage change in CVD risk) when regressing the natural logarithm of the Framingham
risk score on individuals’ sociodemographic characteristics and a fixed effect for district.
Household wealth quintile, education, and living in an urban area were positively associated
with CVD risk among both sexes, but for all 3 variables the coefficients for males were substan-
tially smaller than those for females. The association between education and CVD risk was
weak once the regressions were adjusted for other sociodemographic characteristics. The
regression results were similar when using Harvard–NHANES or Globorisk (WHO–ISH does
not yield a continuous risk score) (Tables K and L in S1 Table).
Fig 8 shows that while mean BMI, high blood glucose, and mean systolic BP were all posi-
tively associated with household wealth and living in an urban area, the prevalence of high
blood glucose and mean systolic BP were nonetheless high in middle and old age among the

 poorest wealth quintiles and in rural areas. Smoking, on the other hand, was more common in
poorer quintiles, in rural areas, and among males.
Discussion
Pooling and analyzing data on CVD risk for 797,540 adults across India (a country that
accounts for more than one-sixth of the world’s population [4]), we identified important varia-
tion in risk among states (with CVD risk tending to be highest in the northern, northeastern,
and southern states) and by individuals’ sociodemographic characteristics. In particular, we
found that (i) CVD risk was higher in urban areas and among males, (ii) while mean BMI was
substantially higher among wealthy than poor individuals, high blood glucose and high systolic
BP were common among poor individuals in middle and old age, and (iii) smoking was most
prevalent among men, in poorer wealth quintiles, and in rural areas. Thus, while a major
investment in CVD and risk factor prevention, screening, and treatment is needed across
India, this study provides important new insights on the distribution of CVD risk to effectively
target health system resources for CVD management to those most at risk and most in need.
Given that we found that district-level mean CVD risk was positively associated with district
wealth and urbanization, such investments may be crucial to minimize further rises in CVD
risk as socioeconomic development and urbanization in India progress over the coming
decades.
Even though the Globorisk and WHO–ISH scores were developed specifically with the goal
of providing CVD risk estimates in populations for which no validated CVD risk calculator
exists [22,32,33], the absence of a CVD risk equation that has been validated in South Asian
cohorts is a major limitation of this study. Nonetheless, CVD risk calculators are used

 routinely in clinical settings (where they are employed in conjunction with a clinical assess-
ment) in India [40]. Although this does not necessarily justify their employment at the popula-
tion level, there has been a recent move to applying these risk equations to entire populations.
For instance, one of the WHO’s NCD Global Action Plan targets (that “at least 50% of eligible
people receive drug therapy and counselling to prevent heart attacks and strokes” by 2020, for
which the WHO defined eligibility as a 10-year CVD risk � 30% [30]) is based on the concept
of applying CVD risk equations to the population level. In addition, several recent studies have
used CVD risk calculators for population-level assessments of CVD risk [22,32,41]. Neverthe-
less, we wish to emphasize here that the absolute risk predictions provided in this study should

 be interpreted with caution. Indeed, the lack of validation in South Asian populations may be
one reason that our risk estimates varied widely across CVD calculators. Specifically, the Fra-
mingham and Harvard–NHANES risk scores yielded substantially higher estimates than Glo-
borisk and WHO–ISH. This observed difference in estimates was expected to some degree
given that Globorisk and WHO–ISH predict the risk of (fatal or nonfatal) myocardial infarc-
tion or stroke, whereas the Framingham and Harvard–NHANES risk scores include a broader
set of outcomes (Table 1). Having acknowledged this limitation, we do believe that the CVD
risk predictions are useful as a summary measure of CVD risk when assessing variation of risk
among population groups. In this regard, it is important to highlight that the patterns of varia-
tion in CVD risk by state, rural versus urban residence, and individual-level sociodemographic
characteristics were very similar across the 4 different risk calculators used in this study.
This study has several additional limitations. First, a relatively high percentage (27.1%) of
participants had a missing value for at least 1 variable needed to calculate their CVD risk.
While we show that participants excluded because of a missing value had similar summary sta-
tistics for CVD risk factors as those included in the analysis, there is nonetheless potential for
selection bias. Second, a 1-time capillary blood glucose measurement is not recommended for
the diagnosis of diabetes in clinical settings [42]. However, this screening method has been
shown to have an acceptable sensitivity and specificity for defining diabetes in population-
based research, and is hence the recommended method for monitoring diabetes prevalence in
the WHO’s STEPwise Approach to Noncommunicable Disease Risk Factor Surveillance [43–

 45]. Nonetheless, to be clear about this limitation of our data, we refer to high blood glucose
values (or being on treatment for diabetes) as “high blood glucose” in this paper rather than
“diabetes.” Third, the questionnaire used in both the DLHS-4 and AHS was designed such that
only those who answered in the affirmative to having had symptoms (of any type) lasting for
more than 1 month during the last 1 year were asked whether they were “getting regular treat-
ment” for the condition. Our data thus likely underestimate the number of participants who

household wealth quintile. These are crude (not age-standardized) estimates. “Smoking” refers to smoking of any tobacco products but does not include chewing of
tobacco. High blood glucose was defined as a high capillary blood glucose measurement (�7.0 mmol/l if fasted and �11.1 mmol/l if non-fasted) or reporting to be on
regular treatment for diabetes.

 were on treatment for hypertension and diabetes. Fourth, we were unable to exclude partici-
pants with a current or previous CVD (e.g., a previous myocardial infarction) because data on
participants’ medical history were not collected. Since those with a previous or current CVD
tend to have a higher CVD risk than predicted with a CVD risk score, this limitation biases
our CVD risk estimates for the population of India downwards. Lastly, the CVD risk scores
used here do not take into account consumption of smokeless tobacco, which is common in
India and may increase CVD risk [46,47].
In conclusion, this study identified important variation in CVD risk and risk factor preva-
lence among states and population groups in India—information that will be essential for
effective targeting of resources and interventions for prevention, screening, and treatment to
those most at risk and most in need. Such investments in targeted CVD care programs as well
as relevant health policy measures are urgently needed—particularly in states with a high CVD
risk—if India is to minimize CVD’s adverse consequences for health, well-being, financial risk
protection, and economic growth. Given the size and projected growth of India’s population,
the determination and effectiveness of the country’s measures to prevent and treat CVD over
the coming years will have an important bearing on the achievement of the SDGs at the global
level.
