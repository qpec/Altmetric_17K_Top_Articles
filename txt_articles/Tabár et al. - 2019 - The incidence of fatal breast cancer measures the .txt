BACKGROUND: Women and their health care providers need a reliable answer to this important question: If a woman chooses to 
participate in regular mammography screening, then how much will this choice improve her chances of avoiding a death from breast 
cancer compared with women who choose not to participate? METHODS: To answer this question, we used comprehensive registries 
for population, screening history, breast cancer incidence, and disease-specific death data in a defined population in Dalarna County, 
Sweden. The annual incidence of breast cancer was calculated along with the annual incidence of breast cancers that were fatal 
within 10 and within 11 to 20 years of diagnosis among women aged 40 to 69 years who either did or did not participate in mammog-
raphy screening during a 39-year period (1977-2015). For an additional comparison, corresponding data are presented from 19 years 
of the prescreening period (1958-1976). All patients received stage-specific therapy according to the latest national guidelines, ir-
respective of the mode of detection. RESULTS: The benefit for women who chose to participate in an organized breast cancer 
screening program was a 60% lower risk of dying from breast cancer within 10 years after diagnosis (relative risk, 0.40; 95% confi-
dence interval, 0.34-0.48) and a 47% lower risk of dying from breast cancer within 20 years after diagnosis (relative risk, 0.53; 95% 
confidence interval, 0.44-0.63) compared with the corresponding risks for nonparticipants. CONCLUSIONS: Although all patients 
with breast cancer stand to benefit from advances in breast cancer therapy, the current results demonstrate that women who have 
participated in mammography screening obtain a significantly greater benefit from the therapy available at the time of diagnosis 
than do those who have not participated. Cancer 2019;125:515-523. © 2018 The Authors. Cancer published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer mortality data include women who were diagnosed over the previous years, often over decades. Conversely, 
breast cancer incidence data include women who may die of breast cancer over the coming years, often over decades. 
Thus, incidence and mortality data for a given year are based on different cancer cases, requiring adjustments for 
changes in incidence and therapy over time. In the context of breast cancer screening and its effect on breast cancer 
mortality, the issue is that exposure or not to screening pertains to the time of diagnosis, whereas the endpoint, death 
from breast cancer, takes place years later.
To overcome this disparity, we have used a new methodology to improve the evaluation of the impact of orga-
nized mammography screening on death from breast cancer; we have calculated the annual incidence of breast can-
cers fatal within 10 years and within 11 to 20 years after breast cancer diagnosis. This novel indicator, the incidence 
of fatal breast cancer, provides a direct measure of the impact of earlier diagnosis through mammography screening 
upon women who participate in screening (screen-detected and interval cancer cases combined) compared with women

who do not participate in screening. Using the incidence 
of fatal cancer with long-term follow-up virtually elim-
inates length bias and greatly reduces the influence of 
lead-time bias. Jonsson et al demonstrated that lead time 
is longest in cancers that do not prove fatal and is very 
short in fatal cancers.1,2 A 20-year follow-up period can 
be expected to give a reliable indication of the eventual 
fate of most patients with breast cancer, because it has 
been demonstrated that approximately 95% of deaths 
from breast cancer occur within 20 years of diagnosis.3-5 
We studied women aged 40 to 69 years and used their 
person-years at the time of diagnosis as the denominator 
for breast cancers that were fatal at 10 and 20 years. The 
incidence of fatal breast cancer avoids the biases affecting 
survival analysis and case fatality calculations, for which 
the denominators are time to death and cancer cases, re-
spectively. Overdiagnosis is not an issue when studying 
fatal cancers, because an overdiagnosed breast cancer, by 
definition, cannot ever be fatal.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The population we studied includes all women aged 40 
to 69 years in the county of Dalarna, Sweden, during 
39 years of the screening era (1977-2015). In addition, 
we present the results from 19 years of the prescreening 
period (1958-1976) for additional comparison with ob-
servations in the screening era. This enables both con-
temporaneous and historical comparisons of the rate of 
death from breast cancer among women before the onset 
of the screening programs (1958-1976) and starting in 
1977 among those who did and did not participate in 
mammography screening. Dalarna County had a stable 
population of women who were aged 40 to 69 years dur-
ing the 6 decades of this study (mean, 52,438 women 
aged 40-69 years).
The Swedish Cancer Registry was founded in 
1958 and provides data about all women diagnosed 
with breast cancer. Having obtained permission from 
the Ethics Committee of Uppsala University, Sweden 
(Ups dnr 03-671), data on all breast cancer cases di-
agnosed at ages 40 to 69 years in Dalarna County, 
Sweden, were extracted. The cause and date of death 
of each patient with breast cancer who died were col-
lected from the National Death Registry of the Swedish 
National Board of Health and Welfare. Breast cancer 
deaths and all other causes of death are included in 
the reports from this registry using codes according to 
the International Classification of Diseases. Vital sta-
tistics on the mid-year population of women aged 40 
to 69 years residing in Dalarna County during each 
of the years from 1958 to 2015 were obtained from 
the National Population Registry to calculate the de-
nominator of the corresponding annual incidence of 
fatal breast cancer. Follow-up was complete through 
December 31, 2015.
The population-based, organized mammography 
screening program began examining women in Dalarna 
County, Sweden, on October 3, 1977, first with a ran-
domized trial, in which approximately two-thirds of the 
population aged 40 to 69 years were regularly invited to 
screening,6 followed by the service screening program, in 
which all women aged 40 to 69 years were regularly invited 
from 1986 onward. In the randomized controlled trial 
(RCT), women aged 40 to 74 years were invited to attend 
single-view mammography screening at intervals of 24 
months for women aged 40 to 49 years and 33 months for 
those aged 50 to 74 years.3 In the service screening program, 
women aged 40 to 54 years are invited to mammography 
screening every 18 months, and those aged 55 to 69 years 
are invited to mammography screening every 24 months. 
The screening protocol is 2-view mammography.7 These 
personal invitations to mammography screening were sent 
by authority of the County Council using data from the 
population registry. The dates of all screening mammog-
raphy examinations for each participating woman in the 
county were and continue to be recorded in the archives 
of the Department of Mammography at the Falun Central 
Hospital. The scheduled date of the next screening exam-
ination was (and continues to be) allocated prospectively 
by the screening authority for each invited woman in the 
county regardless of whether or not she participated in the 
previous screening examination. The date of invitation to 
and participation in screening as well as the date of the next 
scheduled invitation were entered prospectively into the 
database and were used to determine the status of screen-
ing participation for all women aged 40 to 69 years. These 
dates also were used to determine the detection mode of 
each breast cancer case during the 39-year period that cor-
responds to the screening era; in the 19-year prescreening 
period, no women were invited to screening, nor was there 
any mammography equipment in the county.
The population that participates in screening, deter-
mined separately for each year, includes all women who 
participated in their most recent scheduled mammogra-
phy screening examination; all others were classified for 
that year as not participating in screening. Women who 
were diagnosed with breast cancer through 2005 all had 
10 years of follow-up, and those who were diagnosed

Cancer  February 15, 2019
through 1995 all had 20 years of follow-up using the cal-
culation of person-years mentioned above.
The detection mode of each breast cancer case was 
determined as follows: 1) breast cancers diagnosed in 
women who had participated in their most recent screen-
ing examination, including interval cancers, were classi-
fied as cancers in women participating in screening; and 
2) breast cancers diagnosed in the prescreening era and in 
women who were invited but did not participate in their 
most recent scheduled screening examination were classi-
fied as breast cancers in women who had not participated 
in screening. The numbers of cases of breast cancer that 
were fatal within 10 years and within 11 to 20 years of 
diagnosis and the corresponding person-years, stratified 
by screening participation in the screening period, were 
determined from the sources listed above.
The annual incidence (per 100,000 women aged 
40-69 years at diagnosis) of breast cancer and of breast 
cancer that was fatal within 10 years and within 11 to 
20 years of diagnosis, respectively, were calculated for all 
women in the 19-year prescreening period and separately 
for women who did or did not participate in screening 
during the 39-year screening period. Five-year moving 
averages were calculated for both the prescreening and 
screening periods, which involved truncating the data for 
nonparticipants and participants by 2 years at each end.
It could be argued that the relative risk (RR) 
estimates associated with screening are affected by 
self-selection bias, because cancers diagnosed among 
nonparticipants after 1989 were among women who 
chose not to attend screening. Therefore, we adjusted the 
RR of the incidence of cancers that were fatal within 20 
years of diagnosis for self-selection bias using the method 
described by Duffy et al.8 Details are provided in the 
Supporting Materials.
The Swedish National Treatment Guidelines for 
breast cancer have stage-specific protocols, which are 
independent of detection mode and must be adhered 
to closely by therapeutic teams.9,10 Tailoring therapy to 
the advantage or disadvantage of any woman according 
to whether or not she attended screening would be con-
trary to accepted medical practice. Furthermore, over 
the 58-year period of this study, all women residing in 
Dalarna County received treatment in the Falun Central 
Hospital.
RESULTS
Figure 1 illustrates the population of women aged 40 to 
69 years in Dalarna County according to nonparticipa-
tion and participation in mammography screening from 
1958 to 2015. The mean number of women aged 40 to 
69 years over the period of our study was 52,438. During 
the period from 1986 to 2015, when all women aged 40 
to 69 years were regularly invited to an organized, pop-
ulation-based screening program, the women who chose 
to undergo mammography screening comprised 85.1%

(n = 1,351,708 of 1,588,784 women) of the invited 
population.
During the 58-year period of our study, 4513 
women were diagnosed with breast cancer; of these, 3231 
women (1225 in the prescreening period and 2006 in the 
screening period through 1995) could be followed for 20 
years after diagnosis. Another 1281 women who were di-
agnosed with breast cancer in the years 1996 to 2005 
could be followed for 10 years after diagnosis. Altogether, 
1061 women died from breast cancer within 10 years of 
diagnosis (552 in the prescreening period and 509 in the 
screening period), and another 213 women (87 in the 
prescreening period and 126 in the screening period) 
died from breast cancer 11 to 20 years after diagnosis.
Tables 1 and 2 detail the incidence of breast can-
cer (invasive and in situ combined) and the incidence 
of breast cancer that proved fatal within 10, 11 to 20, 
and 20 years of diagnosis during the prescreening period 
and for both nonparticipating and participating women 
during the screening period. Table 1 includes all women 
with breast cancer who had a minimum of 10 years of 
follow-up (detected through 2005), and Table 2 includes 
all women with breast cancer who had a minimum of 20 
years of follow-up (detected through 1995).
The data in Figure 2A-C are presented as 5-year 
moving averages. Figure 2A illustrates the annual in-
cidence per 100,000 women aged 40 to 69 years for all 
breast cancers (invasive and in situ) combined, according 
to their status of participation in screening. Breast can-
cer incidence gradually increased over the 6 decades, both 
among women who participated in screening and among 
those who did not. There was a slightly higher incidence 
of breast cancer (RR, 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.07-1.26) in participants versus nonparticipants during 
the screening period (Table 3). The overall breast cancer 
incidence was higher during the screening period both 
for participating women (88%; RR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.75-
2.01) and for nonparticipating women (62%; RR, 1.62; 
95% CI, 1.48-1.78) compared with the prescreening pe-
riod (Table 4).
Figure 2B presents the annual incidence of breast 
cancers that were fatal within 10 years of diagnosis per 
100,000 women, demonstrating the effect of participa-
tion in screening upon breast cancer deaths. Figure 2C 
presents the annual incidence of breast cancers that were 
fatal within 11 to 20 years of diagnosis per 100,000 
women, demonstrating a similar incidence of breast can-
cer death among participants and nonparticipants alike.
The contemporaneous comparison in Table 3 indi-
cates that the incidence of breast cancers that were fatal 
within 10 years of diagnosis per 100,000 women aged 
40 to 69 years during the screening period was signifi-
cantly lower (60%) among participants compared with 
nonparticipants (RR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.34-0.48). For 
cancers that were fatal within 20 years of diagnosis, the 
corresponding figure is a reduction of 47% (RR, 0.53; 
95% CI, 0.44-0.63) in the risk of dying from breast can-
cer among screening participants. After adjustment for 
potential self-selection bias, there remained a significant 
45% reduction in the risk of dying from breast cancer 
within 20 years of diagnosis in association with screening 
participation (RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.45-0.67).

(54%) among women who participated in screening 
 
(RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.39-0.53) than it was in the pre-
screening period, but it was slightly greater (13%) among 
those who did not participate in screening (RR, 1.13; 
95% CI, 0.97-1.32).
DISCUSSION
The conventional judgment of the effectiveness of organ-
ized breast cancer screening still relies heavily on meta-
analyses of intention-to-treat estimates from RCTs to 
determine whether sending women invitations to partici-
pate in mammography screening actually reduces breast 
cancer mortality.11,12 Although the demonstrated benefit 
of these invitations was the basis for shaping health care 
policy, summary estimates from meta-analyses underesti-
mate the benefit of attending mammography screening. 
In addition, variability among RCTs in the attendance 
rates and in the sensitivity of protocols further underes-
timates the benefit of screening.13 Every woman and her 
health care provider need to know how much her chance 
of avoiding a premature death from breast cancer will im-
prove if she chooses to participate in regular screening.
Here, we report the annual incidence of breast cancers 
that became fatal within 10 or 20 years after breast cancer 
diagnosis. This novel method provides a direct measure of 
the beneficial impact of participating in mammography 
screening compared with not participating. Using the in-
cidence rates of fatal cancers allows us to directly compare 
cancers that were diagnosed during the study period among 
women who did and did not participate in mammogra-
phy screening. This method considerably reduces the risk 
of lead-time bias given the long duration of follow-up and 
also, for all practical purposes, eliminates the potential in-
fluence of length bias, because length bias cases cannot re-
duce the incidence of fatal cancers when the denominator 
is the population at risk rather than cancers (case fatality).
The use of this method requires prospectively col-
lected, reliable data on the date of diagnosis, the detection 
mode of each individual cancer case, and the date of dis-
ease-specific death over several decades of follow-up. In 
addition, it is necessary to have comprehensive data from 
a stable, defined population, including the screening his-
tory on an individual basis. National death registries should 
be used to identify breast cancer deaths, including those 
in women who have moved to other parts of the country. 
These stringent requirements account for the infrequent use 
of this valuable methodology. A recent publication used the 
incidence rates of prostate cancer fatal within 10 years to 
clarify the role of the prostate-specific antigen test in the 
significant decrease in mortality from prostate cancer.14 The 
authors of that report noted that using 10 years of follow-up 
to determine whether the disease is fatal may not be long 
enough to eliminate lead-time bias completely or to nullify 
calendar period shifts in lead time attributable to changes 
in diagnostic practice.14 When we also applied this novel 
method to breast cancer with incidence data on cancers that 
proved fatal within years 11 to 20 after diagnosis, we ob-
served similar results for participants and nonparticipants 
alike (Fig. 2C). Thus, it appears that an evaluation of the 
incidence of fatal breast cancer during the first 10 years after 
diagnosis will provide a reliable measure of the benefit of 
regular participation in mammography screening.

 The Incidence of Fatal Breast Cancer/Tabár et al
521
Cancer  February 15, 2019
The increased incidence of breast cancer overall was 
16% higher in participants than in nonparticipants, sug-
gesting an element of lead time. However, this is unlikely 
to affect our estimate of the effect on incidence of fatal 
cancers for 2 reasons. First, Jonsson et al demonstrated 
that, on average, lead time in fatal cancers is very short 
(approximately 0.29 years). This is because fatal cancers 
are either not screen-detected (ie, have zero lead time) or, 
despite screen detection, the advance in time of diagno-
sis is too short to affect the ultimate outcome (lead time 
is present but short). Second, there has been ample time 
for the nonparticipant group to “catch up” in terms of 
lead time, because most deaths from breast cancer occur 
within 20 years of diagnosis. When comparing the inci-
dence of cancers that were fatal within 20 years between 
participants versus nonparticipants, there remains a 47% 
reduction in the risk of dying from breast cancer in the 
women participating in screening and a 45% difference 
after adjustment for selection bias. This indicates that 
lead time has little impact on these results.
The incidence of cancer among nonparticipating 
women during the screening era was 62% greater than 
in the prescreening era, whereas the incidence of cancer 
that was fatal within 10 years was only 13% greater, in-
dicating a benefit attributable to improved treatment and 
management of the disease. If there had been no such 
benefit, then it might be expected that the increase in the 
incidence of fatal breast cancers would be closer to the in-
crease in the incidence of breast cancer. It is worth noting 
that we have used a more conservative estimate of 17% in 
adjusting for self-selection, so our adjusted estimates may 
slightly underestimate the benefit of screening. However, 
the substantially lower incidence of cancers that were 
fatal at either 10 years (60 %) or 20 years (47%) in the 
participating women compared with the nonparticipat-
ing women within the screening period indicates that 
a woman’s decision to participate in screening resulted 
in a greater reduction in death from breast cancer com-
pared with women who did not participate. This notable 
difference is attributable to earlier detection and treat-
ment at an earlier phase in the natural history of the dis-
ease among women who participated in mammography 
screening.7,15,16 Despite advances in treatment, women 
who participated in mammography screening had the 
added advantage of earlier detection and received a far 
greater benefit from less aggressive therapy than women 
who did not participate.
This large and significant reduction in the in-
cidence of breast cancers that proved fatal within 10 
years in association with screening is consistent with 
other observational studies for which individual data on 
screening participation were available. For a review of 
such studies in Europe, see Broeders et al17 and the re-
cent update of the International Agency for Research on 
Cancer (IARC) Handbook on Breast Cancer Screening.7 
Substantial reductions in breast cancer mortality with 
screening have been reported in North America,18,19 
Asia,20 Australasia,21 and elsewhere.7
Because the majority of women in the population 
attend some (but not all) of their screening invitations, we 
have reclassified the individual women in the population 
each year according to whether or not they participated 
in their latest screening mammography examination. 
The situation is different for the women who are diag-
nosed with breast cancer, because the classification of 
each cancer case is made only once, according to whether 
the woman participated in her latest screening examina-
tion. Thus, we are measuring the effect that the screen-
ing mammography examination has had on whether the 
 
patient dies of breast cancer.
Evidence from multiple RCTs, meta-analyses, and 
numerous observational studies indicates that significant 
breast cancer mortality reductions are achieved through 
organized mammography screening programs.7 Despite 
this, artificial controversies still persist regarding the 
value of mammography, largely driven by conclusions 
drawn from study designs that are poorly suited to esti-
mate the benefit of screening.22,23 Among the hierarchy 
of study designs, ecological studies are generally accorded 
a lower status compared with RCTs or studies that use 
individual data, such as case-control and cohort studies.7
Among the observational designs, perhaps the 
weakest is the utilization of trend analysis using registry 
data, for which drawing conclusions is complicated by 
changes in breast cancer incidence over time, contam-
ination from breast cancer deaths in the screening era 
from cases diagnosed in the prescreening era, insufficient 
follow-up periods, improvements in treatment over time, 
and (most important) the absence of data on exposure 
to screening.24,25 Neglecting the results from RCTs and 
incidence-based mortality studies with data on exposure 
to screening,7,17,26 investigators using trend analyses have 
concluded that modern mammography does not reduce 
the incidence of advanced breast cancers and only suc-
ceeds in detecting insignificant or slowly growing cancers 
that are not life threatening while missing more aggres-
sive tumors that prove fatal.27-29 Instead, they argue, it 
is therapeutic advances that are principally or entirely 
responsible for the observed reductions in breast cancer 
mortality.29,30

More credible evidence indicates otherwise. We have 
demonstrated that the risk of breast cancer death in the 
mammography RCTs was strongly correlated with the risk 
of being diagnosed with an advanced breast cancer (ie, the 
greater the reduction in risk of being diagnosed with an ad-
vanced breast cancer, the greater the observed mortality re-
duction).16 Furthermore, although it has been claimed that 
mammography screening can identify only insignificant or 
slowly growing cancers that are not life threatening, while 
missing more aggressive tumors that prove fatal, it has been 
demonstrated that the reverse is true.31 An incidence-based 
mortality analysis of tumors diagnosed within the screen-
ing phase of the Swedish 2-County Trial revealed that more 
deaths were prevented from grade 3 tumors compared with 
those prevented from grade 1 and 2 tumors, and that the 
proportions of tumors measuring ≥15 mm and lymph 
node-positive tumors were reduced substantially in those 
who had grade 3 tumors from the invited group compared 
with the control group. It has also been claimed, using the 
same weak study designs, that therapeutic advances must 
be mostly or entirely responsible for the observed reduc-
tions in breast cancer mortality in nations with established 
mammography screening programs,27,30 although existing 
data have not substantiated this claim.22 Cancer registries 
usually do not have information on the mode of detection, 
and the relative impact of screening versus treatment in re-
ducing breast cancer mortality cannot be evaluated without 
knowing the mode of detection (participation vs nonpar-
ticipation) in each individual case. Furthermore, the rela-
tive contribution of screening versus treatment will depend 
on the screening uptake rate, the sensitivity of the protocol, 
and access to state-of-the-art treatment. Likewise, exercises 
in modeling based on estimation of the short-term effect 
of screening using aggregate data, without being able to 
distinguish between individual women who are or are not 
screened, also cannot measure the true impact of screen-
ing.32,33 To date, no advance in therapy has been able to 
overcome the prognostic disadvantage of being diagnosed 
with a lymph node-positive tumor. Currently, reducing 
deaths from breast cancer depends on the advantages of 
early detection and state-of-the-art therapy.
Although much attention has been devoted to the 
potential “harms” of participating in regular screening, 
little attention has been given to the harms of not partici-
pating in regular screening, the greatest harm being a sig-
nificantly increased risk of death from breast cancer. In 
addition, women who choose not to participate in screen-
ing will experience a significantly higher rate of advanced 
breast cancers, a greater need for more extensive surgery, 
a greater risk of upper body impairments (including 
lymphedema), and more extensive radiotherapy and che-
motherapy, for which many women experience signifi-
cant, enduring adverse physical and cognitive effects. 
For each breast cancer death prevented by screening, a 
woman will be spared the terminal stages of this disease, 
and she will gain an average of 16.5 life-years.16,34,35
Although some consider that advances in adjuvant 
therapy and chemotherapy mainly are responsible for im-
proved breast cancer prognosis in screened populations 
in the modern era,28 we believe that it is time to focus 
attention on the combination of diagnosis and therapy, 
instead of viewing them as independent, or worse, as 
competing interests. Our results demonstrate that the 
benefit of therapy is significantly greater for women who 
have participated in mammography screening. Our re-
sults, from precise, individual-based data covering 6 de-
cades, should provide women and their physicians with 
reassurance that participating in regular, high-quality 
mammography screening is the best way to reduce the 
risk of a premature death from breast cancer.
