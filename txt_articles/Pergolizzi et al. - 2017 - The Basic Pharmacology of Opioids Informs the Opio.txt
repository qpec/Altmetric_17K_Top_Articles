ABSTRACT
Morphine and other opioids are widely used to
manage moderate to severe acute pain syn-
dromes, such as pain associated with trauma or
postoperative pain, and they have been used to
manage chronic pain, even chronic nonmalig-
nant pain. However, recent years have seen a
renewed recognition of the potential for over-
use, misuse, and abuse of opioids. Therefore,
prescribing opioids is challenging for healthcare
providers in that clinical effectiveness must be
balanced against negative outcomes—with the
possibility that neither are achieved perfectly.
The current discourse about the dual ‘epi-
demics’ of under-treatment of legitimate pain
and the over-prescription of opioids is clouded
by inadequate or inaccurate understanding of
opioid drugs and the endogenous pain path-
ways with which they interact. An understand-
ing of the basic pharmacology of opioids helps
inform the clinician and other stakeholders
about these simultaneously under- and over--
used agents.

INTRODUCTION
The inappropriate use, nonmedical use, misuse,
and abuse of prescription opioid analgesics in
the USA has been described as an epidemic [1].
The rate of drug overdose deaths in the USA
attributable to opioids (both prescription opioid
pain relievers and heroin) doubled from 2000 to
2014 [2]. The National Survey on Drug Use and
Health found that in 2011, 8.7% of Americans
over the age of 12 identified themselves as cur-
rent drug users, including of opioids [3]. Heroin
use, which appears to be associated with pre-
scription opioid abuse [4], presents additional
challenges [5]. The economic burden of opioid
misuse has been estimated to be over $78 billion
a year in the USA [6], with the additional
human costs of reduced quality of life, psycho-
logical distress, social dysfunction, disordered

Increasingly,
newspapers
and
other
media
outlets report on the prescription pain reliever
crisis and opioid addiction, so what was once a
‘‘medical problem’’ has now become a public
health crisis and a major societal issue [8].
The opioid crisis is actually two crises that
may be seen as dual epidemics. The first crisis
is opioid abuse, in which opioids are widely
prescribed
and
may
be
widely
abused
[9],
although it is unclear if the imposition of strict
opioid
prescribing policies can significantly
affect levels of opioid misuse [10]. The second
crisis
is
that
of
uncontrolled
pain.
About
two-thirds of the world does not have access to
opioid analgesics, so that moderate to severe
pain and even the very extreme pain associated
with terminal cancer at end of life is not
effectively treated [11–15]. So egregious was
the care of patients facing excruciating pain
that in 1988, the World Health Organization
advocated the widespread use of oral morphine
and other opioid analgesics for cancer patients
[16], and pain control emerged in international
conferences as a ‘‘fundamental human right’’
[17, 18]. In the past decades, pain management
has emerged as a clinical goal in and of itself,
and pain medicine has become a recognized
medical specialty, albeit one in its relative
infancy.
Opioids thus present medicine, and indeed
society, with a double-edged sword. On the one
hand, opioid agents are crucial to managing
pain in specific populations, and professional
compassion demands that physicians alleviate
pain when and where they can do so both
effectively and safely. It may also be put forth
as a laudable public health goal to restore
function and productivity to patients whose
painful symptoms might otherwise have dis-
abled them. On the other hand, opioids are
powerful substances that can be misused and
abused with devastating individual and soci-
etal consequences. Greater clarity and scien-
tific
objectivity
are
needed
to
better
understand the inappropriate use of opioids.
Toward that end, we present here a concise
review of opioid pharmacology with the aim of
adding to the understanding of opioid misuse
and abuse.

PAIN PATHWAYS
The physiology of pain can help illuminate why
opioids are such effective pain relievers. The
current model of a representative pain pathway
describes a noxious stimulus originating in the
periphery (such as a blow to the hand), which is
then transmitted via primary afferents to the
dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and, from there, to
the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. From the
spinal cord, the noxious stimulus signal travels
up the ascending pain pathways to the brain
(e.g., the spinothalamic tract). The brain then
interprets the pain signal, assigns its meaning,
and initiates appropriate responses, such as
moving the hand out of harm’s way. The brain
also sends a signal back via descending path-
ways
that
modulates
the
incoming
signal.
Hence pain-transmission signals travel upward
from the spinal cord to the brain along any of
several ascending pathways, and pain-modulat-
ing signals travel downward (from the brain to
the spinal cord) along descending pathways (see
Fig. 1).
Receptors
for
endogenous
opioids
(e.g.,
endorphins and enkephalins) are located in the
periphery, the DRG, the spinal cord, and the
brain.
Opioid
analgesic
agents
mimic
the
endogenous opioids and act by binding to (have
‘‘affinity’’
for)
the
7-transmembrane
G-pro-
tein-coupled opioid receptors, thereby activat-
ing them (‘‘agonist action’’, ‘‘intrinsic activity’’),
albeit with individual differences in receptor
binding and signal transduction [19]. In this
way, exogenous opioids can inhibit pain signals
as they travel along ascending pathways or
mitigate pain via descending pain pathways. Of
course, individual responses to pain can vary
markedly and are colored by emotional state,
past experiences, memories, genetics, and other
factors [19], with the result that pain is both a
physical response and a multifactorial subjec-
tive experience.

Pain Ther (2017) 6:1–16
 While nociceptive pain involves a noxious
stimulus at the periphery that is interpreted as
pain by the brain, neuropathic pain occurs
when nerve fibers at any of the points along the
pain pathway or at the periphery become
injured,
damaged,
and/or
dysfunctional
or
transmit signals inappropriately [20]. In that
way, neuropathic pain can arise without an
overt injury or noxious stimulus. While noci-
ceptive pain and neuropathic pain are distinct
clinical entities, they sometimes occur together
in a condition described as multimechanistic
pain.
OPIOID RECEPTORS
Three distinct opioid receptor peptides have
been pharmacologically characterized. They are
termed
mu-opioid
peptide
(MOP)
receptors
(MORs),
named
for
morphine;
delta-opioid
peptide (DOP) receptors (DORs), named for tis-
sue of the vas deferens; and kappa-opoid pep-
tide (KOP) receptors (KORs), named for the
selective
agonist
ketocyclazocine
[21].
The
genes of each of these receptor systems have
been cloned (Oprm, Oprd1, and Oprk1, respec-
tively). All three types include seven mem-
brane-spanning regions and are coupled to G
proteins that couple the receptors to intracel-
lular effectors that transmit (transduce) pain
signals. Most of the common clinically used
opioid agents have the greatest affinity and
intrinsic activity at mu-opioid receptors and less
at delta- and kappa-opioid receptors, but they
may produce some effects at the latter two
receptor types, particularly at higher doses.
Other factors may play an important role, such
as, for example, transporter proteins that can
facilitate or impede passage across the blood–-
brain barrier [22].
The cellular mechanisms by which opioids
produce their effects are well established. All
three activate inwardly rectifying K? conduc-
tance and inhibit voltage-gated Ca2? currents.
Because Ca2? influx is required for proper vesi-
cle function and stimulus-secretion coupling of
neurotransmitter release, opioids are able to
decrease the release of excitatory neurotrans-
mitters, such as glutamate, substance P and
calcitonin-gene-related-peptide [23]. Activation
of rectifying K? conductance hyperpolarizes
neurons, making them more resistant to exci-
tation and, in that way, raises the pain trans-
mission threshold. Recent research suggests that
G protein signaling can be selectively targeted
[24].
Other brain chemicals, such as monoamines,
come into play. Norepinephrine (NE) generally
mediates descending inhibition, that is, inhibi-
tory
pain
control.
Serotonin
(5-hydrox-
ytryptamine) has the paradoxical property of
being both anti-nociceptive and pro-nocicep-
tive in that it can either mediate descending
inhibition of pain signals or facilitate pain sig-
naling [25]. Crosstalk between the opioid and
the monoaminergic systems permit the brain to
interpret and evaluate pain (as a surrogate
indication of tissue damage) yet not be over-
whelmed by it (that is, not interfere with ‘‘fight
or flight’’ responses or recovery) [26]. In this
complex chemical system, signal fidelity is of
prime importance.
It is worth noting here that if acute pain
transitions into the more clinically challenging

 syndrome of chronic pain [27], the relative
contribution
of
the
monoaminergic
system
increases
markedly
[28].
NE-mediated
pain
emerges as particularly important in chronic
painful conditions because the opioidergic sys-
tem may lose influence due to opioid tolerance,
receptor down-regulation, or opioid-induced
hyperalgesia (OIH) [29]. OIH is the seemingly
paradoxical
condition
in
which
prolonged
exposure to opioids lowers the pain threshold
[30]. In such cases, patients may obtain pain
relief from mixed NE/serotonin reuptake inhi-
bitors,
such
as
venlafaxine,
while
selective
serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, such as fluox-
etine, may not produce clinically important
pain relief [31].
In summary, opioids caninhibit pain signaling
along the ascending pain pathway, exert modu-
latory effects on pain signals at the supra-spinal
level, and modulate pain signals via the descend-
ing monoaminergic system pathways.
CLASSIFICATION OF OPIOIDS
Until recently it was believed that the various
opioids
(such
as
codeine,
fentanyl,
hydro-
codone,
hydromorphone,
morphine,
oxy-
codone, and others) comprised a single, but
large, drug class. Indeed, although there are
subtle differences among opioids, such as vary-
ing degrees of preferences for specific opioid
receptors, they have much in common and
essentially work in the same way. However,
increased knowledge of drug molecules, pain
mechanisms,
and
brain
biochemistry
has
revealed that opioids are far more individual-
ized than previously believed, which compli-
cates a classification system. Some modern
analgesics have both opioid and nonopioid
mechanisms
of
action,
and
these
become
important differentiating factors in classifica-
tion systems [19, 22]. Moreover, certain trans-
porter
proteins
(e.g.,
P-glycoprotein)
can
regulate the degree to which these agents pass
the blood–brain barrier, which can affect in turn
how the individual opioid agent is distributed
through the body [32]. For example, oxycodone
passes the blood–brain barrier to a greater
degree than does morphine [33, 34].
NOVEL CATEGORIES
OF ANALGESICS
An increasing understanding of the multiple
mechanisms that can underlie pain syndromes
has given rise to multimechanistic approaches
to analgesia, such as the combination of an
opioid with a nonopioid [35]. The emerging
concept of ‘‘signaling bias’’ addresses the fact
that subsets of the G-proteins can mediate the
antinociception conferred by various opioids in
different ways [36]. The emergence of these
drugs is the result of an important new direc-
tion in drug development which attempts to
provide the analgesic benefits of opioids while
simultaneously attempting to reduce the side
effects and abuse potential of conventional
opioids [22].
•
Buprenorphine [37] exhibits many charac-
teristics of conventional opioids but has
been found in preclinical studies to have a
slow receptor dissociation kinetics which
confer it with some unique characteristics
[38, 39]. There might even be a nonopioid
component
to
buprenorphine’s
analgesic
action [40]. While its mechanisms remain
to be more fully elucidated, it must be
considered
to
be
a
distinct
agent
with
attributes markedly different from opioids
such as morphine [22]. Thus, buprenorphine
is generally regarded as an opioid, but one
with unique characteristics [39]. Its potential
for abuse is generally considered to be lower
than that of such agents as oxycodone or
hydromorphone
although
buprenorphine
misuse has increased somewhat in recent
years [41]. Buprenorphine has become well
established in opioid maintenance [42].
•
Tramadol has been demonstrated in animal
models and in humans to have both opioid
and nonopioid mechanisms of analgesic
action [43]. The parent drug binds to the
MOR with a relatively weak affinity, but its
metabolite O-desmethyltramadol (M1) binds
4
Pain Ther (2017) 6:1–16
 to the MOR with a much greater affinity and
is likely the source of tramadol’s opioid-like
effects. However, tramadol produces a nono-
pioid analgesic effect as well, likely related to
the inhibition of neuronal reuptake of NE
and serotonin [44]. Tramadol has also been
reported to have some anti-inflammatory
activity [45]. The two mechanisms of action
(opioid plus nonopioid) act synergistically
with each other [46]. Furthermore, the dual
mechanism of action may help explain why
tramadol is generally not a well ‘‘liked’’ drug
by abusers. It is considered to have a rela-
tively lower potential for abuse than sin-
gle-mechanism pure opioids [47]. The two
mechanisms of action appear to deliver
contradictory and conflicting messages to
the brain with respect to reward. Although
tramadol is often listed with opioid agents, it
is difficult to group it with the ‘‘classic
opioids’’ as it has such important distinc-
tions and, when used judiciously, the nono-
pioid component appears to be the major
contributor to the analgesic effect.
•
Tapentadol is likewise challenging to clas-
sify. It has a dual mechanism of action in a
single molecule (unlike tramadol, which is a
racemate) and with respect to analgesia, it
has no active metabolites [48]. It has both an
affinity for opioid receptors and contributes
to noradrenergic activity in a synergistic way
[49]. With its unique attributes, tapentadol
has been classified an entirely new class of
analgesic, although it is often listed as an
opioid [50].
•
Cebranopadol is a novel analgesic that acts
as both an opioid agonist and also acts on
nociception/orphanin FQ-peptide receptors
[51]. This new agent may represent a new
classification of drug. Further study will
determine how best to categorize it, but it
has marked distinctions from the traditional
opioids.
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OPIOID
ANALGESICS
The World Health Organization pain ladder
classified opioids as ‘‘weak’’ (e.g., codeine) or
‘‘strong’’ (e.g., morphine, oxycodone, and oth-
ers) [16], but today such designations are less
frequently used, with modern classifications
based on mechanism of action (e.g., receptor
binding profile) [52, 53]. In addition to phar-
macodynamic (PD) differences among opioids
(e.g., receptor affinity), there are also pharma-
cokinetic (PK) differences (for instance, mor-
phine is metabolized by different enzymatic
pathways than is oxycodone) and sometimes
large differences in patient response. Certain
genetic polymorphisms (e.g., poor metabolizers
or ultra-rapid metabolizers) may affect opioid
metabolism to the extent that they may cause a
response in the patient that is less than or more
than the anticipated one. Genetic differences in
patient response are particularly common with
codeine, but may occur with other opioids as
well [54–56]. It is for that reason that opioid
rotation—changing
from
one
opioid
to
another—can be helpful when a patient does
not achieve the desired analgesic benefit from
one product, as that patient may respond better
to another opioid [57].
Opioids are effective pain relievers for a
variety of painful conditions, including cancer
pain, traumatic pain, postsurgical pain, and
pain at end of life [58–62], but opioid analgesics
are not equally effective for all types of pain. For
example, opioids are not very effective and
might be better avoided in the treatment of
headaches,
such
as
cluster
headaches
and
migraines [63]. The long-term use of opioids for
chronic noncancer pain remains controversial
[64–67]. The role of opioid analgesics in the
treatment of moderate to severe chronic non-
cancer pain has been advocated by specialty
societies and is recognized as appropriate and
valuable by many experts, but their use raises
serious issues in light of opioid misuse and
abuse [68–71].
With prolonged exposure to opioids, toler-
ance develops to some effects. Tolerance may be
defined as the condition in which the patient
requires a larger dose of opioids to maintain the
same level of analgesic relief. Tolerance is not a
dangerous,
aberrant,
or
unexpected
phe-
nomenon; indeed, it is to be expected and may
develop in as little as a few days [72]. Tolerance
can be a troublesome phenomenon, as patients
Pain Ther (2017) 6:1–16
5
 who seek more drugs are often suspected by
healthcare
providers
of
being
drug-seekers.
Indeed, a condition described as ‘‘pseudo-ad-
diction’’ occurs when a tolerant patient is per-
ceived as being an addict because the patient
requests higher doses of opioids [73, 74]. Opioid
tolerance occurs with both analgesic effect (ne-
cessitating higher doses to maintain equianal-
gesic effect) and certain adverse effects (but
generally not constipation), which diminish
over time as the patient builds up tolerance.
Patients may also become dependent on opi-
oids. The term ‘‘dependence,’’ similar to much of
the terminology surrounding opioids, can be
misleading. Physical dependence occurs with
just a few days of sustained opioid consumption
[75], manifested upon abrupt discontinuation
(‘‘abstinence-induced’’ withdrawal) by unpleas-
ant
and
distressing
withdrawal
symptoms.
Physical dependence is the normal compen-
satory response to the sustained use of an opioid
and is neither aberrant or unexpected [76]. It may
be clinically managed by having the patient taper
off the drug gradually under medical supervision.
SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY
OF OPIOIDS
Opioid-associated side effects are well described
in the literature and may be divided into those
that are transient in most patients and will
remit as the patient develops tolerance (such as
nausea and vomiting) and those that persist
(such as constipation). The clinical response
varies among patients; side effects may be
transient in some patients but persist in others.
Tolerance to opioid-associated side effects may
also be categorized as innate (genetically pre-
determined and present from the initial dose) or
acquired. Acquired tolerance to adverse effects
may be due to a PK factor (e.g., drug metabo-
lism), PD factor (e.g., upregulation or down-
regulation of opioid receptors), or even learned
response (e.g., patient expectations may reduce
effects over time) [72, 77]. The side effects of
opioids may be treatment limiting [78]. Thus,
for pain management, it may be necessary for
the clinician to manage opioid-associated side
effects.
Transient Side Effects
Among the transient effects of opioids are
nausea and vomiting, pruritus, sedation, respi-
ratory depression (which can be life threaten-
ing), and urinary retention.
Nausea and Vomiting
The emetogenic effects
observed during opioid exposure are primarily
derived from three major mechanisms: a direct
effect on the chemoreceptor trigger zone (pe-
ripherally located outside of the blood–brain
barrier in the area postrema within the brain’s
fourth ventricle), enhanced sensitivity of the
vestibular apparatus (via activation of the MORs
in the vestibular epithelium), and delayed gas-
tric emptying mediated via both central and
peripheral MORs [79]. Refractory and possibly
opioid-induced constipation and stool impac-
tion may contribute to nausea and vomiting.
Nausea and vomiting occur in a subset of
patients and typically resolve over time as the
patient develops tolerance to these effects. For
prophylactic management, a dopamine antag-
onist, such as metoclopramide (a prokinetic
agent), or a serotonin receptor antagonist, such
as ondansetron, are considered first-line thera-
pies by some [80]. In certain cases, when nausea
and vomiting are associated with vertigo, an
anticholinergic drug, such as scopolamine, or
an antihistamine, such as diphenhydramine,
may be helpful [81].
Puritus
Pruritus
without
skin
lesions
is
a
commonly reported adverse effect of opioid
therapy [82]. It had been theorized that opi-
oid-associated pruritus was related to the his-
tamine release that occurs with morphine, but
other opioid agents, such as fentanyl and oxy-
morphone, are not associated with histamine
release, yet exhibit a similar incidence of pruri-
tus [83]. Agonism at the MOR may be the cause
of opioid-associated pruritus [84]. While the
exact mechanism remains to be elucidated,
antihistamines are often considered the first--
line therapy, or a low-dose opioid antagonist,
such as oral naltrexone, may be prescribed [85].
Sedation
Sedation
can
be
a
particularly
impactful adverse effect when considered in the
setting of chronic opioid use, such as in treating
6
Pain Ther (2017) 6:1–16
 cancer pain. It may negatively impact the
quality of life and function. Typically, psy-
chostimulants,
such
as
methylphenidate
or
modafinil, are used to address sedation. While
the evidence supporting the use of methylphe-
nidate comes from randomized controlled trials
and seems stronger than that from retrospective
studies supporting modafinil, modafinil is a
non-amphetamine stimulant that lacks some of
the
associated
side
effects
typical
of
amphetamines, such as anxiety and tachycardia
[86–89]. Other psychostimulants from various
other drug classes, such as donepezil or caffeine,
do not have the same evidence-based support of
efficacy [89].
Respiratory Depression
Although respiratory
depression is a potentially lethal adverse effect
of most opioids, tolerance is known to develop
fairly rapidly, thus allowing for proper dosing
when referenced with respect to common clin-
ical guidelines [90]. When respiratory depres-
sion occurs as a result of opioid toxicity, an
opioid receptor antagonist is most frequently
used to reverse this effect [91]. It is also impor-
tant to consider the possible synergistic effects
on respiratory depression when other centrally
acting agents, such as benzodiazepines, are used
concomitantly with opioids [92]. Further, cer-
tain medical disease states, such as cancer, sleep
apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
pneumonia, and other conditions, may have an
impact on the patient’s respiratory rate or tidal
volume which may make the patient more
vulnerable
to
respiratory
distress
and
depression.
Urinary Retention
Two main mechanisms
have been proposed that might explain opi-
oid-associated urinary retention. The first is the
activation of opioid receptors in the spinal cord
leading to bladder wall relaxation [93]. The
second
is
that
opioids
affect
the
bladder
sphincter and surrounding nerves by increasing
parasympathetic input to the detrusor muscle
and, in so doing, inhibit somatic impulses to
the urethral sphincter [94]. A meta-analysis
suggests that concomitant administration of a
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
may reduce the incidence of urinary retention,
but this may be due to the net opioid-sparing
effects of NSAID use, which reduces opioid-re-
ceptor activation [95]. Urinary retention can be
treated using relatively benign therapies, like an
a-1 adrenoreceptor antagonist (e.g. tamsulosin).
Persistent Side Effects
Opioid-induced
Constipation
One
of
the
most commonly reported and troublesome side
effects of opioid use is opioid-induced consti-
pation (OIC) [96]. OIC may occur in 45% of
patients on chronic opioid therapy [97] and can
adversely affect the patient’s quality of life,
productivity, and pain control [98]. It is per-
ceived by patients to be one of the most dis-
tressing side effects, with the potential to limit
opioid treatment, and can be a serious and
costly adverse effect [99, 100]. The mechanisms
underlying OIC may be similar to those for
urinary retention, namely, activation of opioid
receptors in the enteric circuitry of the gas-
trointestinal (GI) tract inhibits gastric empty-
ing, increases sphincter tone, induces stationary
motor patterns, and blocks peristalsis. Com-
bined with the antagonistic effects of opioids at
the secretomotor neuron level of the enteric
nervous system, such an action may prolong
transit times and dehydrate the stool [101, 102].
Whether or not certain opioids produce less
constipation than others has been the subject of
some study, but exceeds the scope of our article
[103–106]. While laxatives and other conven-
tional
constipation
treatments
may
be
employed, OIC may be laxative-refractory [107].
Peripherally acting MOR antagonist (PAMORA)
agents, such as naloxegol and methylnaltrex-
one, may be helpful [108–111]. Combination
drugs that incorporate an opioid ? naltrexone
may also be useful; a timed-release mechanism
allows the antagonist (e.g., naltrexone) to be
active as the drug passes through the GI system,
but the antagonist is metabolized before the
agonist enters the systemic circulation [112].
Endocrine
Function
Opioids
may
affect
endocrine function because they bind to opioid
receptors located within the hypothalamus and
possibly with receptors in the pituitary gland and
testes [113]. Binding at the hypothalamic level
results in a decrease in gonadotropin-releasing
Pain Ther (2017) 6:1–16
7
 hormone, which in turn leads to a decrease in
luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating
hormone at the level of the pituitary, which may
result in hypogonadism. Hypogonadism is asso-
ciated with decreased libido, disrupted menses,
and impotence in males [114]. Once proper
diagnosis has been made, the patient might be
administered
supplementary
testosterone
or
estrogen and prolactin [115].
MISUSE, ABUSE, AND ADDICTION
Opioids activate dopaminergic neurons in the
ventral tegmental area of the brain and, in that
way, can produce a strong positive central
reinforcement. Opioid use is perceived by many
(but not all) individuals as pleasant, enjoyable,
and even stimulating [116]. Because of the
comparatively rapid rate at which tolerance can
develop, individuals need higher and higher
doses of opioids to achieve the same rewarding
feelings or pleasant sensations. Just as higher
doses are needed to maintain the same thera-
peutic efficacy, higher doses may be needed to
achieve the same rewarding effect. Not all
individuals find opioids pleasurable, but many
do. Scientists and clinicians have developed
ways of measuring this on scales of so-called
‘‘drug liking’’ [117]. While there can be consid-
erable variation among individual drug abusers,
general trends can be observed. Oxycodone, for
example, is much more ‘‘liked’’ than buprenor-
phine. Actual abuse statistics reflect drug-liking
in part, but can also be significantly impacted
by such factors as local availability, prices, and
access.
The inappropriate use of opioids is not just
one behavior; inappropriate use exists along a
broad continuum. In general, opioid misuse
encompasses such relatively mild inappropriate
behaviors such as not taking drugs as prescribed
(skipping doses on good days and doubling up
on bad days), chemical coping (taking opioids
to manage stress or help improve mood), abuse
(recreational use, taking opioids to get high),
addiction, and diversion [118]. Some patients
appear to be particularly vulnerable to inap-
propriately using opioids while others do not.
Most
patients
prescribed
opioids
for
pain
control
do
not
become
addicted
to
them
[119]—but some do. Many prescription opioid
addicts never had a legitimate pain indication
for the drugs. Thus, the population of those
who use opioids inappropriately is heteroge-
neous and somewhat fluid [120]. While there is
a lack of objective evidence that would firmly
establish who becomes addicted and why, some
risk factors have emerged along with demo-
graphic information about those who experi-
ence overdose:
•
In a retrospective study of 2039 patients with
at least one instance of opioid overdose,
most were unemployed (78%) and about
one-third had mental health disorders (35%)
[121].
•
Overdose is more likely to occur in people
who live in rural rather than urban environ-
ments [122].
•
Among the known risk factors that are
associated with inappropriate use of opioids
are younger age, male sex, a history of
substance abuse, and mental health disor-
ders [123]. However, opioid abuse occurs at
older ages as well [121].
•
Cigarette smokers, those who used nonopi-
oid illicit drugs, and those with a history of
prior arrest for breaking the law have higher
probability of opioid abuse [124].
A variety of validated tools exist to help
identify patients at elevated risk for opioid use,
such as the Opioid Risk Tool (ORT) and the
Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients
with Pain-Revised (SOAPP-R), among others
[125]. It is important that patients be assessed
periodically for their risk of opioid abuse, as risk
factors may change over time [120]. While
much is known about risk factors for opioid
abuse, it is not possible to use such systems to
positively determine that any one patient will
definitely abuse or not abuse an opioid. More-
over, these risk factors only help define which
legitimate pain patients are at risk for abuse and
cannot help to prevent abuse by those who do
not have contact with the healthcare system
and start their drug misuse with drugs obtained
in other ways (e.g., from friends, street dealers,
etc.).
Addiction is the most severe form of inap-
propriate
use
of
opioids
and
is
the
least

 understood. It is a complex biopsychosocial
phenomenon that has contributing genetic and
environmental factors [126]. Unlike patients
who may be only physically dependent on
opioids, addicts take opioids compulsively even
when they
fully understand
that they are
harming themselves [127]. Addiction is charac-
terized by intense cravings for opioids that may
not diminish even after the patient has under-
gone detoxification.
HOW DOES OPIOID
PHARMACOLOGY CONTRIBUTE
TO ABUSE?
Opioid
abuse
has
occurred
wherever
and
whenever opioids have been used [128]. There
are many reasons for their appeal to abusers,
and opioid pharmacology plays a major role in
why and how they are abused.
First, opioids are very effective pain relievers.
It has been speculated that some opioid abusers
may be in pain (mental or physical) and use
opioids
to
self-medicate.
Since
the
fastest
growing age group of those who misuse or abuse
prescription opioids is the group aged 50–64
years and many painful conditions increase in
prevalence with older age, it may be that some
individuals are trying to manage pain [129]. The
pain may also be psychological. Childhood
trauma and abuse have been linked to substance
abuse
disorders,
including
opioid
addiction
[130]. Thus, opioid misuse may be a coping
mechanism for certain individuals with psy-
chological distress, unresolved emotional pain,
stress, and mental health disorders, such as
obsessive–compulsive disorder [131]. In other
words, some opioid abuse may be misguided
attempts at managing pain that cannot be
handled any other or any better way.
Second, it may be that persistent pain and
stress facilitate addiction in that they result in
maladaptive disruptions to the body’s neuronal
and hormonal systems that, in turn, can affect the
mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways. It is thought
that the KOR system in particular is involved in
some of these neuronal changes because it con-
trols how dopamine is released into the nucleus
accumbens. For example, chronic pain and stress
can affect how the body perceives such things as
food, social interaction, or drugs as a form of
rewardorcoping mechanism. Inthisway,chronic
pain itself may set the stage to make a patient
more likely to perceive opioids as rewarding and
thus addictive [132]. The mesolimbic dopamine
circuit influences how responsive an individual
will be to opioids and antidepressants [133]. It has
also been theorized that for a person suffering
pain, pain relief in and of itself is rewarding; that
is, an individual experiences pain, takes an opioid
analgesic, experiences profound relief, and inter-
prets this as a positive, rewarding, pleasurable
experience. This ‘‘reward’’ may cause neuronal
adaptation that encourages the patient to con-
tinue taking opioids [134].
Finally, opioids may also produce feelings of
pleasure, contentedness, and satisfaction in
certain individuals. The role of opioids on social
bonding in humans is a new field of study, but
there is evidence that feelings of social con-
nection may be enhanced by opioids and
diminished by an opioid antagonist (e.g., nal-
trexone) [135]. Since feelings of human attach-
ment and bonding are so crucial to feelings of
happiness and connection, further study is
needed to determine why opioid ‘‘liking’’ varies
so markedly among individuals [136].
ABUSE MITIGATION
There is much that can be done in terms of how
opioids are formulated, developed, marketed,
distributed, and described to patients that may
reduce the potential for abuse. First, certain
opioid
agents
are
associated
with
a
lower
potential for abuse than others. For example,
buprenorphine is generally considered to have
lower rates of abuse than oxycodone, although
published comparisons suggest that they have
equivalent
clinical
efficacy
[38].
Tramadol
(which is not a true classic opioid) is also less
associated with abuse than other agents, likely
due to its dual mechanisms of action [47].
Second,
drug
formulations
can
play
an
important role. In an effort to reduce opioid
abuse, manufacturers have started to develop
specific formulations designed to resist or deter
abuse. These may include tablets that resist
Pain Ther (2017) 6:1–16
9
 crushing or dissolving (so that the drug cannot
be inhaled, smoked, or injected) or products
that sequester the opioid in such a way that it
cannot be extracted. Some abuse-deterrent for-
mulations combine the active opioid agent with
an antagonist, such as naltrexone (which would
negate the effects of the opioid); if the drug is
taken properly, the opioid is effective, but if the
drug
is
tampered
with,
the
naltrexone
is
released
[137,
138].
The
Food
and
Drug
Administration has developed standards for
abuse-deterrent
formulations
(ADFs)
and
encourages all future opioid analgesic agents to
be formulated as an ADF [139].
Other strategies to help prevent abuse include
patient education, prescriber education, pre-
scription drug monitoring programs, patient--
provider opioid contracts, and risk assessment
(risk
evaluation
and
mitigation
strategies),
among others.
CONCLUSION
Opioids are powerful and effective pain relievers
that play an important role in pain manage-
ment, particularly in patients suffering from
moderate to severe pain. While opioids are a
broad class of drugs, there are subtle and
not-so-subtle differences among them. How-
ever, inappropriate opioid use ranges from mild
forms of misuse to recreational use to outright
addiction and represents a significant public
health concern. While opioid pharmacology
contributes to the potential for these drugs to be
abused, steps can be taken to reduce potential
abuse, including risk assessments of patients
vulnerable to abuse, abuse-deterrent formula-
tions, patient and prescriber education, and
other efforts. This knowledge can inform the
opioid discourse by providing the basic science
foundation upon which the epidemiological,
legal, and other factors can be objectively eval-
uated, interpreted, and discussed (debated).
