Abstract 
30 
Training specificity is considered important for strength training, although the functional and 
31 
underpinning physiological adaptations to different types of training, including brief 
32 
explosive contractions, are poorly understood. This study compared the effects of 12-wks of 
33 
explosive-contraction (ECT, n=13) vs. sustained-contraction (SCT, n=16) strength training vs. 
34 
control (CON, n=14) on the functional, neural, hypertrophic, and intrinsic contractile 
35 
characteristics of healthy young men. Training involved 40 isometric knee extension 
36 
repetitions (x3/wk): contracting as fast and hard as possible for ~1 s (ECT); or gradually 
37 
increasing to 75% of maximum voluntary torque (MVT) before holding for 3 s (SCT). 
38 
Torque and EMG during maximum and explosive contractions, torque during evoked octet 
39 
contractions, and total quadriceps muscle volume (QUADSVOL) were quantified pre and post 
40 
training. MVT increased more after SCT than ECT (23 vs. 17%; effect size [ES]=0.69), with 
41 
similar increases in neural drive, but greater QUADSVOL changes after SCT (8.1 vs. 2.6%; 
42 
ES=0.74). ECT improved explosive torque at all time points (17-34%; 0.54≤ES≤0.76) due to 
43 
increased neural drive (17-28%), whereas only late-phase explosive torque (150 ms, 12%; 
44 
ES=1.48) and corresponding neural drive (18%) increased after SCT. Changes in evoked 
45 
torque indicated slowing of the contractile properties of the muscle-tendon unit after both 
46 
training interventions. These results showed training-specific functional changes that 
47 
appeared to be due to distinct neural and hypertrophic adaptations. ECT produced a wider 
48 
range of functional adaptations than SCT, and given the lesser demands of ECT this type of 
49 
training provides a highly efficient means of increasing function.

New & Noteworthy 
55 
Explosive-contraction strength training (ECT) denoted by brief contractions with high rate of 
56 
torque development produced a wider range of functional adaptations than sustained-
57 
contraction strength training (SCT), with improvements in early- and late-phase explosive 
58 
strength, as well as maximum strength. In contrast, SCT only improved maximum and late-
59 
phase explosive strength. The substantially lower loading duration of ECT (7% of SCT) 
60 
makes this a less-demanding training modality compared to SCT, which may be 
61 
preferentially tolerated by musculoskeletal patients.

Introduction 
65 
Maximum and explosive strength are two components of skeletal muscle function that can be 
66 
critical to the performance of human movement. Maximum strength is the greatest amount of 
67 
force that can be generated, whereas explosive strength reflects the ability to increase force 
68 
rapidly from a low or resting level (1, 20, 48). Muscle weakness, including low maximum 
69 
and explosive strength, contributes to the functional limitations experienced by numerous 
70 
patient groups (35, 42, 43), including osteoarthritis patients (26). Strength training is widely 
71 
recommended for improving function of all adults (32, 39) and the increases in explosive 
72 
and/or maximum strength that occur following training may have profound benefits to 
73 
mobility, locomotion, and quality of life of older individuals and patients (13, 25, 26, 34, 37, 
74 
44). Whilst training specificity is widely considered important within the context of strength 
75 
training (8, 12, 18, 21), the functional adaptations to different types of strength training are 
76 
not well understood, reducing the efficacy of training guidance and prescription. Furthermore, 
77 
the similarity or specificity of the underpinning neural and contractile adaptations to different 
78 
training regimes has received relatively little attention. 
79

80 
Explosive-contraction strength training (ECT), emphasizing rapid torque development during 
81 
short contractions, is a relatively non-fatiguing training modality that may be well tolerated 
82 
by patient groups (i.e. osteoarthritis) who commonly report substantial fatigue (36, 38) and 
83 
therefore may offer improved adherence within these populations. ECT has been found to 
84 
produce significant increases in both maximum and explosive strength (48). In contrast, 
85 
conventional strength training typically has a primary emphasis of training with sustained-
86 
contractions (SCT) at high loads leading to pronounced fatigue (31) and may neglect rapid 
87 
torque development. Our recent 4-week intervention study contrasted ECT and SCT finding 
88 
distinct training-specific adaptations in functional capabilities and neural drive: maximum 
89 
strength and corresponding electromyography (EMG) increased more after SCT; and early-
90 
phase explosive strength and EMG (≤100 ms) during the rising/explosive phase of 
91 
contraction increased more following ECT (45). This demonstrated that at least in the initial 
92 
stages of a training programme ECT and SCT produce distinct functional and neural 
93 
adaptations. However the efficacy of longer-term ECT for functional and neural adaptations 
94 
remains unknown, and the contrasting influence of these training interventions on the 
95 
intrinsic contractile properties and hypertrophy (volume) of skeletal muscle has yet to be 
96 
investigated. A more comprehensive comparison of ECT and SCT may facilitate a greater 
97 
understanding of the influence of training variables, particularly loading duration (high SCT 
98 
vs. low ECT) and rate of torque development (RTD, high ECT vs. low SCT), on functional 
99 
and physiological adaptations. 
100 
 
101 
The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of 12 weeks of ECT, and compare it 
102 
to SCT and a control group (CON) by assessing the specificity of the functional changes 
103 
(maximum and explosive strength), as well as the underpinning adaptations in neural drive, 
104 
  
5 
intrinsic contractile properties, and muscle volume after these interventions. We hypothesised 
105 
that ECT and SCT would elicit distinct and specific functional changes (ECT>SCT for early-
106 
phase [≤100 ms] explosive strength; SCT>ECT for maximum strength), as a result of distinct 
107 
neural and contractile adaptations.

Materials and Methods 
110 
Participants 
111 
Forty-eight young, healthy, asymptomatic, males who had not completed lower-body strength 
112 
training for >18 months and were not involved in systematic physical training were recruited 
113 
and provided written informed consent prior to participation in this study that was approved 
114 
by the Loughborough University Ethical Advisory Committee. Following familiarization 
115 
participants were randomly assigned to ECT, SCT, or CON groups that were matched for 
116 
maximum voluntary torque (MVT) and body mass. A total of five participants withdrew from 
117 
the study (four due to personal reasons and one was excluded due to non-compliance). Forty-
118 
three participants (ECT [n=13]; SCT [n= 16]; CON [n=14]) completed the study. Baseline 
119 
recreational physical activity was assessed with the International Physical Activity 
120 
Questionnaire (IPAQ, short format (14)). 
121 
 
122 
Overview 
123 
Participants visited the laboratory for a familiarisation session involving voluntary maximum 
124 
and explosive, as well as evoked twitch contractions to facilitate group allocation.  Thereafter, 
125 
two duplicate laboratory measurement sessions were conducted both pre (sessions 7-10 days 
126 
apart prior to the first training session) and post (2-3 days after the last training session and 2-
127 
  
6 
3 days later) 12-weeks of unilateral knee extensor strength training. Axial T1-weighted MRI 
128 
scans of the thigh were also conducted pre (5 days prior to the first training session) and post 
129 
(2-3 days after the final training session). Training and testing were completed with the same 
130 
isometric apparatus. Training for the ECT and SCT groups involved unilateral isometric 
131 
contractions of both legs three times a week for 12-weeks (36 sessions in total), whereas 
132 
CON participants attended only the measurement sessions and maintained their habitual 
133 
activity. All participants were instructed to maintain their habitual physical activity and diet 
134 
throughout the study. Laboratory testing sessions involved recordings of the dominant leg 
135 
isometric knee-extension torque and surface EMG of the superficial quadriceps muscles 
136 
during voluntary maximum and explosive contractions, as well as evoked maximum twitch 
137 
and octet contractions (via electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve). Measurement sessions 
138 
were at a consistent time of day and started between 12:00-19:00. 
139 
 
140 
Training 
141 
After a brief warm-up of sub-maximum contractions of both legs, participants completed four 
142 
sets of ten unilateral isometric knee-extensor contractions of each leg; with sets alternating 
143 
between dominant and non-dominant legs until 4 sets per leg had been completed. Each set 
144 
took 60 s with 2 min between successive sets on the same leg. ECT involved short, explosive 
145 
contractions with participants instructed to perform each contraction “as fast and hard as 
146 
possible” up to ≥80%MVT for ~1 s, and then relax for 5 s between repetitions (Fig. 1 A). A 
147 
computer monitor displayed RTD (10-ms time epoch) to provide biofeedback of explosive 
148 
performance, with a cursor indicating the highest peak RTD achieved throughout the session, 
149 
participants were encouraged to achieve a higher peak RTD with each subsequent contraction. 
150 
The torque-time curve was also shown: firstly, with a horizontal cursor at 80%MVT (target 
151 
  
7 
force) to ensure sufficiently forceful contractions, and secondly, on a sensitive scale 
152 
highlighting baseline torque in order to observe and correct any pre-tension or 
153 
countermovement. 
154 
 
155 
SCT involved sustained contractions at 75%MVT, with 2 s rest between contractions.  In 
156 
order to control the RTD these participants were presented with a target torque trace 2 s 
157 
before every contraction and instructed to match this target, which increased torque linearly 
158 
from rest to 75%MVT over 1 s before holding a plateau at 75%MVT for a further 3 s. All 
159 
training participants (ECT and SCT) performed three maximum voluntary isometric 
160 
contractions (MVCs, see below) at the start of each training week in order to re-establish 
161 
MVT and prescribe training torques. Torque data from the first training session of weeks 1, 6 
162 
and 12 were analysed for all training participants (i.e. ECT and SCT) in order to quantify 
163 
peak loading magnitude (peak torque, mean of all repetitions), loading rate (peak RTD, 50-
164 
ms epoch, mean of all repetitions), and loading duration (defined as time >65%MVT per 
165 
session). 
166 
 
167 
Force and EMG recording 
168 
Measurement and training sessions were completed in a rigid custom-made isometric 
169 
dynamometer with knee and hip angles of 115° and 126° (180° = full extension), respectively. 
170 
Adjustable straps were tightly fastened across the pelvis and shoulders to prevent extraneous 
171 
movement. An ankle strap (35 mm width reinforced canvas webbing) was placed ~15% of 
172 
tibial length (distance from lateral malleolus to knee joint space), above the medial malleolus, 
173 
and positioned perpendicular to the tibia and in series with a calibrated S-beam strain gauge 
174 
(Force Logic, Swallowfield, UK). The analogue force signal from the strain gauge was 
175 
amplified (x370) and sampled at 2,000 Hz using an external A/D converter (Micro 1401; 
176 
  
8 
CED Ltd., Cambridge, UK) and recorded with Spike 2 computer software (CED Ltd., 
177 
Cambridge, UK). In offline analysis, force data were low-pass filtered at 500 Hz using a 
178 
fourth-order zero-lag Butterworth filter (33), gravity corrected by subtracting baseline force, 
179 
and multiplied by lever length, the distance from the knee joint space to the centre of the 
180 
ankle strap, to calculate torque values. 
181 
 
182 
Surface EMG was recorded from the superficial quadriceps muscles (rectus femoris [RF], 
183 
vastus lateralis [VL], vastus medialis [VM]) using a wireless EMG system (Trigno; Delsys 
184 
Inc., Boston, MA). Following skin preparation (shaving, abrading, and cleansing with 70% 
185 
ethanol), Single differential Trigno Standard EMG sensors (Delsys Inc., Boston, MA) each 
186 
with a fixed 1 cm inter-electrode distance were attached at six separate sites over the 
187 
superficial quadriceps muscles at set percentages of thigh length above the superior border of 
188 
the patella (RF 65 and 55%; VL 60 and 55%; VM 35 and 30%) and parallel to the presumed 
189 
orientation of the underlying fibres. EMG signals were amplified at source (x300; 20- to 450-
190 
Hz bandwith) before further amplification (overall effective gain, x909), and sampled at 
191 
2,000 Hz via the same A/D converter and computer software as the force signal, to enable 
192 
data synchronization. In offline analysis, EMG signals were corrected for the 48-ms delay 
193 
inherent to the Trigno EMG system and band-pass filtered (6-500 Hz) using a fourth-order 
194 
zero-lag Butterworth filter. 
195 
 
196 
Pre and post measurement sessions 
197 
Following a brief warm-up of the dominant leg (3 s contractions at 50% [x3], 75% [x3], and 
198 
90% [x1] of perceived maximum) measurements were completed in the following order. 
199 
  
9 
 
200 
Maximum voluntary contractions 
201 
Participants performed 3-4 MVCs and were instructed to “push as hard as possible” for 3-5 s 
202 
and rest for ≥30 s between efforts. A torque-time curve with a horizontal cursor indicating the 
203 
greatest torque obtained within that session was displayed for biofeedback and verbal 
204 
encouragement was provided during all MVCs. Knee extensor MVT was the greatest 
205 
instantaneous torque achieved during any MVC or explosive contraction during that 
206 
measurement session. Root mean square (RMS) EMG for a 500 ms epoch at MVT (250 ms 
207 
either side) was calculated for each electrode site before averaging across the six sites to 
208 
provide a whole quadriceps measurement (QEMGMVT). In addition, RMS EMG at MVT was 
209 
normalized to MMAX area (see below) from the corresponding EMG electrode site and then 
210 
averaged across all quadriceps EMG sites.  
211 
 
212 
Explosive voluntary contractions  
213 
Participants completed ten explosive voluntary contractions. They were instructed to perform 
214 
each contraction “as fast and hard as possible” for ~1 s, in order to exceed 80%MVT, and 
215 
then relax for ≥15 s between contractions. Contractions with a change in baseline torque (pre-
216 
tension or countermovement) of >0.34 Nm in the 300 ms prior to contraction onset were 
217 
discarded. The three best contractions (highest torque at 100 ms) were analysed in detail for 
218 
torque and EMG. Voluntary explosive torque was measured at 50, 100, and 150 ms from 
219 
contraction onset (T50, T100, and T150), before averaging across the three contractions. 
220 
Explosive torque was also expressed relative to MVT to assess if explosive and maximum 
221 
strength changed proportionally. 
222 
  
10 
 
223 
RMS EMG of each of the quadriceps sensor sites was measured over three time periods: 0-50, 
224 
0-100 and 0-150 ms from EMG onset of the first agonist muscle to be activated (see below), 
225 
before averaging to produce overall quadriceps measurements (QEMG0-50, QEMG0-100, 
226 
QEMG0-150) for the three best contractions. RMS EMG values from each sensor were also 
227 
normalized to both EMGMVT and MMAX area for that site before averaging. To decide whether 
228 
to report absolute RMS EMG or RMS EMG normalized to MMAX the intra-participant 
229 
reproducibility of EMGMVT for both EMG measures was assessed over the 12-week 
230 
intervention for CON (see below), and the most reproducible measure used. The ratio of 
231 
Voluntary T50/Octet T50 (see below) was used as an additional measure of volitional neural 
232 
efficacy during the voluntary explosive contractions. 
233 
 
234 
During offline analysis, all torque and EMG onsets were identified manually by visual 
235 
identification by one trained investigator using a systematic approach (46, 49) considered to 
236 
be more valid than automated methods (49). Briefly, torque and EMG signals were initially 
237 
viewed on an x axis scale of 300 ms prior to the contraction and y axis scales of 0.68 Nm 
238 
(torque) or 0.05 mV (EMG) (46, 49) before zooming in to determine the instant of the last 
239 
peak or trough before the signal deflected away from the envelope of the baseline noise. 
240 
 
241 
Evoked twitch and octet contractions 
242 
A constant current variable voltage stimulator (DS7AH; Digitimer Ltd., Welwyn Garden City, 
243 
UK), cathode probe (1-cm diameter, Electro-Medical Supplies Ltd., Wantage, UK), and 
244 
anode electrode (7 x 10 cm carbon rubber electrode; Electro-Medical Supplies Ltd., Wantage, 
245 
UK) were used to electrically stimulate the femoral nerve. The cathode and anode were 
246 
coated with electrode gel and securely taped to the skin over the femoral nerve in the femoral 
247 
  
11 
triangle and over the greater trochanter, respectively. Cathode location was determined by 
248 
delivering single electrical impulses (square wave-pulses of 0.2 ms duration, ≥12 s apart) in 
249 
order to identify the position that elicited the greatest sub-maximum twitch response. The 
250 
current intensity was progressively increased until plateaus in peak twitch force and peak-to-
251 
peak M-wave amplitude were reached.  Then three supra-maximal twitch and MMAX 
252 
responses were evoked (15 s apart) at a higher current (≥50%) to ensure supra-maximal 
253 
stimulation. The following variables were averaged across the three supra-maximal twitch 
254 
contractions: peak twitch torque (Twitch Peak T); absolute torque (Twitch T50) and torque 
255 
expressed relative to Twitch Peak T (Relative Twitch T50) at 50 ms after contraction onset; 
256 
time from contraction onset to peak twitch torque (Twitch TPT); and the cumulative MMAX 
257 
area from EMG onset to the point where the signal returned to baseline for each of the six 
258 
EMG sites. 
259 
 
260 
During the second pre and first post measurement sessions only, octet contractions (eight 
261 
impulses at 300 Hz) were evoked at progressive currents (≥15 s apart) until a plateau in the 
262 
amplitudes of peak torque and peak RTD were achieved. Then, three discrete pulse trains 
263 
(≥15 s apart) were delivered with a higher current (≥20% to ensure supra-maximal 
264 
stimulation) to evoke maximum octet contractions. Peak torque (Octet Peak T), absolute 
265 
torque (Octet T50) and torque expressed relative to Octet Peak T (Relative Octet T50) at 50 ms 
266 
after contraction onset, and time from contraction onset to Octet Peak T (Octet TPT) were 
267 
averaged across the three maximum octet contractions. Due to the discomfort caused by the 
268 
octet contractions a total of seven participants across the three groups were unable to tolerate 
269 
this measurement. 
270 
 
271 
  
12 
 
272 
Muscle volume 
273 
A 1.5T MRI scan of the dominant leg was made in the supine position at a knee joint angle of 
274 
~163° using a receiver 8-channel whole body coil (Signa HDxt, GE). T1-weighted axial 
275 
slices (5 mm thick, 0 mm gap) were acquired from the anterior superior iliac spine to the knee 
276 
joint space in two overlapping blocks. Oil filled capsules placed on the lateral side of the 
277 
participants’ thigh allowed alignment of the blocks during analysis. MR images were 
278 
analyzed by two investigators using Osirix software (version 6.0, Pixmeo, Geneva, 
279 
Switzerland). Pre and post scans of each participant were analyzed by the same investigator. 
280 
The quadriceps (RF, VL, VM, and vastus intermedius; VI) muscles were manually outlined 
281 
in every third image (i.e. every 15 mm) starting from the most proximal image in which the 
282 
muscle appeared. The volume of each muscle was calculated using cubic spline interpolation 
283 
(GraphPad Prism 6, GraphPad Software, Inc.). Total quadriceps volume (QUADSVOL) was 
284 
the sum of the individual muscle volumes. Inter- and intra-rater reliability for QUADSVOL 
285 
calculated from the repeated analysis of five MRI scans was 1.2% and 0.4%, respectively. 
286 
Data from one participant was excluded due to excessive movement artifacts. 
287 
 
288 
Data analysis and statistics 
289 
All data was anonymized prior to analysis. Reproducibility of the measurements over the 12-
290 
week intervention period was calculated for CON (pre vs. post) as within-participant 
291 
coefficient of variation (CVW; (SD/mean) x 100). MVT and QEMGMVT measurements from 
292 
the duplicate test sessions were averaged to produce criterion pre and post values for 
293 
statistical analysis; unless the CVW for the MVT was ≥10% (calculated from duplicate test 
294 
sessions), in which case the lowest MVT value and corresponding QEMGMVT were discarded. 
295 
Mean T50, T100, and T150 and corresponding QEMG (QEMG0-50, QEMG0-100, QEMG and 0-150) 
296 
  
13 
from the duplicate test sessions were used as criterion pre and post values for statistical 
297 
analysis; unless the CVW, (calculated from duplicate test sessions at the given time point) for 
298 
T50 was ≥20%, in which case a weighted mean for all three explosive torque time points and 
299 
corresponding QEMG measures were used.  
300 
 
301 
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). 
302 
Data are reported as means ± SD; apart from within figures where data are mean ± standard 
303 
error of the mean (SE) for presentation purposes. One-way ANOVAs were conducted on all 
304 
pre-test variables to assess whether baseline differences existed between groups. Unpaired t-
305 
tests were used to assess differences in training variables (loading rate, duration, and 
306 
magnitude) between ECT and SCT. Within-group changes were evaluated with paired t-tests. 
307 
Comparison of between-group adaptations to the intervention were assessed with repeated 
308 
measures analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA; group [ECT vs. SCT vs. CON] x time [pre vs. 
309 
post]), with corresponding pre training values used as covariates. When group x time 
310 
interaction effects displayed P<0.05 then post-hoc tests were conducted and included the 
311 
calculation of effect size (ES) and least significant differences (LSD) of absolute changes 
312 
(pre to post) between groups (i.e., ECT vs. SCT, ECT vs. CON, and SCT vs. CON). ES for 
313 
absolute change data was calculated as previously detailed for between-subject study designs 
314 
[30] and classified as: <0.20= “trivial”; 0.20-0.50= “small”; 0.50-0.80= “moderate’; 
315 
or >0.80= “large”). Least significant difference (LSD) post-hoc tests were produced from 
316 
one-way ANCOVAs and were corrected for multiple comparisons (5). We considered there 
317 
to be good evidence of between-group differences if both ES>0.50 and LSD post-hoc P<0.10.

Results 
323 
Group characteristics at baseline 
324 
At baseline no differences (ANOVA, P≥0.767) were observed between groups for habitual 
325 
physical activity (IPAQ: ECT 2047 ± 1081; SCT 2135 ± 1230; CON 2321 ± 1614 metabolic 
326 
equivalent min/wk), age (ECT 25 ± 2; SCT 25 ± 2; CON 25 ± 3 yr), body mass (ECT 70 ± 10; 
327 
SCT 71 ± 9; CON 72 ± 7 kg), or height (ECT 1.74 ± 0.07; SCT 1.75 ± 0.08, CON 1.76 ± 0.06 
328 
m). Similarly, no baseline differences were detected for functional, neural, intrinsic 
329 
contractile properties, or muscle volume. 
330 
 
331 
Reproducibility of Torque and EMG measurements 
332 
The reproducibility of pre and post measures for the CON group over the 12-week period was 
333 
excellent for MVT, T100, and T150 (CVW 2.9, 4.4 and 4.9% respectively), but poor for T50 
334 
(CVW 15.7%). Absolute EMGMVT (9.8%) had better CVW than EMGMVT normalized to MMAX 
335 
area (14.7%), and therefore, absolute EMG data are presented. Twitch (Twitch T50, Twitch 
336 
Peak T, Relative Twitch T50, Twitch TPT) and octet (n=11, Octet T50, Octet Peak T, Relative 
337 
Octet T50, Octet TPT) variables displayed excellent to good CVW values (1.8-6.1%).  
338 
 
339 
Training quantification for ECT vs. SCT 
340 
Loading duration, quantified as time >65%MVT per session, was greater for SCT than ECT 
341 
(unpaired t-test P<0.001; Fig. 1 B). Conversely, ECT involved ~6-fold greater RTD per 
342 
repetition than SCT (unpaired t-test P<0.001; Fig. 1 C). Peak loading magnitude was also 
343 
slightly greater for ECT than SCT (81 ± 4 vs. 75 ± 2%MVT; unpaired t-test P<0.001). 
344 
 
345 
 
346

347 
Voluntary torque 
348 
MVT increased after ECT and SCT (both paired t-test P<0.001), but not following CON 
349 
(P=0.739; Table 1 & 4). The absolute increase in MVT was greater than CON for both ECT 
350 
and SCT (both ES≥2.06 “large”, LSD P<0.001), and 38% larger after SCT than ECT 
351 
(ES=0.69 “moderate”, P=0.052; Fig. 2).  
352 
 
353 
Explosive torque increased at T50, T100, and T150 after ECT (paired t-test P=0.047, P=0.008, 
354 
and P<0.001, respectively; Table 1 & 4). Whereas, there were no changes in explosive torque 
355 
after CON (paired t-test 0.420≤P≤0.847) and only T150 increased following SCT (P<0.001) 
356 
with no change in T50 or T100 (0.140≤P≤0.939). Group comparisons revealed that ECT 
357 
produced greater increases in explosive torque than SCT after 100 ms, but not after 150 ms 
358 
(T100: ES=0.72 “moderate”, LSD P=0.092; T150: ES=0.54 “moderate”, P=0.145), and larger 
359 
increases than CON from 100 ms onwards (T100: ES=0.98 “large”, P=0.042; T150: ES=1.59 
360 
“large”, P<0.001). SCT resulted in greater increases than CON only at T150 (ES=1.48 “large”, 
361 
LSD P=0.008). 
362 
 
363 
Relative explosive torque (%MVT), at all time points, decreased following SCT (paired t-test 
364 
0.004≤P≤0.032; Table 1), but remained unchanged after ECT and CON (0.344≤P≤0.984). 
365 
The decrease in relative explosive torque after SCT was greater than ECT (T100: ES=0.88 
366 
“large”, LSD P=0.015; and T150: ES=0.91 “large”, P=0.006) and CON (T100: ES=1.15 “large”, 
367 
P=0.016; and T150: ES=0.99 “large”, P=0.022; Fig. 3). Changes in relative explosive torque 
368 
did not differ between ECT and CON (T100: ES=0.11 “trivial”, LSD P=0.844; and T150: 
369 
ES=0.12 “trivial”, P=0.547) 
370

372 
Neural drive 
373 
QEMGMVT increased, or had a tendency to increase, after SCT (paired t-test P<0.001) and 
374 
ECT (P=0.099), but not CON (P=0.130; Table 2 and 4). The increase in QEMGMVT was 
375 
greater than CON for both ECT (ES=0.87 “large”, LSD P=0.018) and SCT (ES=2.30 “large”, 
376 
P<0.001), but was not different between ECT and SCT (ES=0.36 “small”, P=0.370; Fig. 2). 
377 
QEMG0-50, QEMG0-100, and QEMG0-150 increased or had a tendency to increase after ECT 
378 
(paired t-test P=0.089, P=0.048 and P=0.003, respectively; Table 2). There were no changes 
379 
in explosive QEMG measurements after CON, and only QEMG0-150 increased after SCT 
380 
(paired t-test P=0.009; Table 2). Group comparisons showed ECT to increase explosive 
381 
neural drive by more than CON at all time points (QEMG0-50: ES=0.85 “large”, LSD P=0.036; 
382 
QEMG0-100: ES=1.07 “large”, P=0.018; QEMG0-150: ES=1.57 “large”, P<0.001; Fig. 3), and 
383 
by more than SCT for QEMG0-150 (ES=0.58 “moderate”, P=0.061) but not earlier periods 
384 
(QEMG0-50: ES=0.58 “moderate”, P=0.101; or QEMG0-100: ES=0.46 “small”,  P=0.254; Fig. 
385 
3). SCT increased QEMG0-150 more than CON (ES=1.20 “large”, LSD P=0.021), but this was 
386 
not the case for earlier periods (0.30≤ES≤0.61 “small” to “moderate”, 0.154≤P≤0.463).  
387 
 
388 
Relative explosive neural drive (as % QEMGMVT) for all time periods decreased after SCT 
389 
(paired t-test, 0.001≤P≤0.004), but not following ECT or CON (P≥0.395; Table 2). After 
390 
SCT the decreases in relative QEMG0-100 were greater than ECT (ES=0.59 “moderate”, LSD 
391 
P=0.086) and CON (ES=0.99 “large”, P=0.045), as was QEMG0-150 vs. ECT (ES=0.62 
392 
“moderate”, P=0.066). Changes in relative explosive QEMG0-100 and QEMG0-150 did not 
393 
differ between ECT and CON (0.02≤ES≤0.29, LSD 0.623≤P≤0.697) 
394 
 
395 
  
17 
Voluntary T50/Octet T50 ratio appeared to increase after ECT (n=12; pre 42 ± 20% vs. post 53 
396 
± 19%) but did not reach statistical significance for the within group change (paired t-test 
397 
P=0.122) or group x time interaction effect (ANCOVA, P=0.107). No changes in the 
398 
Voluntary T50/Octet T50 ratio occurred after SCT (n=14; pre 47 ± 15% vs. post 46 ± 19%; 
399 
paired t-test P=0.772) or CON (n=11; pre 40 ± 18% vs. post 40 ± 17%; P=0.816). 
400 
 
401 
Intrinsic contractile properties and muscle size 
402 
Both training groups increased Octet Peak T (paired t-test ECT P=0.001, SCT P=0.015) and 
403 
Octet TPT (ECT P=0.017, SCT P<0.001), with no change after CON (0.689≤P≤0.986; Table 
404 
3). Increases in Octet TPT were greater after SCT than CON (ES=1.35 “large”, LSD 
405 
P=0.009), but not for other comparisons (P≥0.132, 0.42≤ES≤0.74 “small” to “large”). No 
406 
changes in Octet T50 occurred after ECT, SCT or CON (paired t-test 0.489≤P≤0.857), 
407 
although Relative Octet T50 decreased after ECT and SCT (both paired t-test P=0.001), but 
408 
not CON (P=0.638; Table 3). There was no ANCOVA interaction effect for Octet T50 (Table 
409 
3), however the decreases in Relative Octet T50 after both ECT (ES=1.36 “large”, LSD 
410 
P=0.086) and SCT (ES=1.37 “large”, P=0.003) were greater than CON, but these changes 
411 
were similar after ECT and SCT (ES=0.25 “small”, P=0.209; Fig. 4). 
412 
 
413 
Twitch Peak T was unchanged in all three groups (paired t-test 0.127≤P≤0.821), although 
414 
Twitch TPT was longer after both training interventions (0.009≤P≤0.047; Table 3), but not 
415 
CON (P=0.132). No changes in Twitch T50 occurred after ECT, SCT, or CON (paired t-test 
416 
0.489≤P≤0.857). Relative Twitch T50 decreased after SCT and ECT (paired t-test 0.008≤P 
417 
≤0.032), but not CON (P=0.919; Table 3). 
418 
 
419 
  
18 
QUADSVOL increased 8.1% after SCT from 1820 ± 274 to 1967 ± 316 cm3 (n= 15; paired t-
420 
test P=0.001), but not following ECT (n=13; 1770 ± 252 to 1816 ± 286 cm3; P=0.247) or 
421 
CON (n=14; 1891 ± 272 to 1906 ± 261 cm3; P=0.550; Table 4). There was a group x time 
422 
interaction effect for QUADSVOL (ANCOVA, P=0.018), with the change in QUADSVOL after 
423 
SCT being greater than that following CON (ES=1.15 “large”, LSD P=0.021) and ~3-fold 
424 
greater than after ECT (ES=0.74 “moderate”, P=0.074; Fig. 5). Increases in QUADSVOL after 
425 
ECT were not greater than CON (ES=0.27 “small”, LSD P=0.552).

Discussion 
429 
This study compared the specificity of functional adaptations to 12-weeks of ECT vs. SCT 
430 
and assessed underpinning neural, contractile, and hypertrophic adaptations contributing to 
431 
these functional changes. MVT increased after both SCT and ECT, but these changes were 
432 
greater after SCT (+23 vs. +17%). Increases in EMGMVT were similar following SCT and 
433 
ECT, whilst greater increases in QUADSVOL (+8.1 vs. +2.6%) suggest muscle size rather than 
434 
neural drive explained the greater improvement in MVT after SCT than ECT. Improvements 
435 
in early-phase explosive torque production (≤100 ms) only occurred after ECT (+17-34%), 
436 
were greater than after SCT (at 100 ms) and appeared to be due to increased early-phase 
437 
neural drive. ECT and SCT both improved explosive strength at 150 ms (+18% vs. +12%) 
438 
with corresponding increases in neural drive likely explaining the enhancement in late-phase 
439 
explosive torque production. Octet Peak T increased after training, but there were no changes 
440 
in the intrinsic contractile explosive capability (Twitch and Octet T50) as the time-course of 
441 
the evoked response (Octet and Twitch TPT as well as Relative Octet and Twitch T50) 
442 
decreased after both SCT and ECT, indicating a likely slowing of the muscle’s contractile 
443 
properties after both training interventions. Overall, the results support our hypothesis of 
444 
  
19 
distinct and specific functional changes (ECT>SCT for early-phase explosive strength; 
445 
SCT>ECT for maximum strength), and this appeared to be due to distinct neural and 
446 
hypertrophic, but not intrinsic contractile adaptations.  
447 
 
448 
Both ECT and SCT increased maximum strength, and by more than CON, but with greater 
449 
increases after SCT (+23 vs. +17%). Maximum strength has been reported to increase by 
450 
varying extents following both SCT (+11-36%; (1, 4, 9, 24, 40)) and ECT (+7-25%; (7, 41, 
451 
48)), yet this study is the first to directly compare the magnitude of maximum strength 
452 
improvements after prolonged training with these different approaches. Loading duration 
453 
(also referred to as time under tension) and loading magnitude have been suggested to be 
454 
important training stimuli for maximum strength adaptation (15). Maximum strength 
455 
improvements after ECT were ~70% of those after SCT, despite ECT involving only 7% of 
456 
the loading duration (time >65%MVT) and thus considerably less effort and fatigue. In 
457 
contrast the loading magnitude of the two interventions in the current study were 
458 
physiologically, if not statistically, quite similar (ECT 81 vs. SCT 75%). Overall this 
459 
provides evidence that loading magnitude rather than loading duration accounts for the 
460 
majority of the maximum strength improvement following the first 12 weeks of SCT and is 
461 
the primary training stimulus. In this case, brief explosive contractions up to a high loading 
462 
magnitude appear to be an efficient means of increasing maximum strength without the 
463 
requirement for sustained muscular contractions. Furthermore, if loading magnitude is the 
464 
primary stimulus for maximum strength gains then it is possible that even higher loading 
465 
magnitudes than those employed in the current study (i.e. >95%MVT), which may be 
466 
achievable during very short contractions, could provide an even greater stimulus for 
467 
enhancing maximum strength. The importance of loading magnitude for maximal strength 
468 
gains may have application for optimizing training prescription of athletes and patient 
469 
  
20 
populations, in particular for patient groups where more sustained contractions may be 
470 
problematic due to fatigue. 
471 
 
472 
Neural drive at MVT increased more after both SCT and ECT than CON. Numerous previous 
473 
studies have found neural drive at MVT (assessed with EMG) to increase after SCT 
474 
interventions (24, 47), however the current study is the first to show that short duration 
475 
explosive contractions can produce increases in neural drive at MVT and this likely explained 
476 
the efficacy of ECT for increasing MVT. In fact there was no difference between ECT and 
477 
SCT for this neural adaptation (EMGMVT), indicating that loading magnitude rather than 
478 
loading duration is the primary stimulus for increasing neural drive at MVT. Previous 
479 
evidence suggests that increased motor unit firing frequency explains enhanced neural drive 
480 
at MVT after training (27, 28), and this likely accounts for the improvement of both groups in 
481 
the current study. In contrast, ECT did not stimulate an increase in muscle volume, and 
482 
therefore, while ECT appears to be effective at enhancing neural aspects of maximum 
483 
strength it is relatively ineffective at stimulating hypertrophy. Whereas SCT did induce an 
484 
increase in muscle volume, that was ~3-fold greater than after ECT (+8.1 vs. +2.6%). Thus 
485 
hypertrophy was sensitive to loading duration and this adaptation appears to explain the 
486 
larger improvements in maximum strength for SCT vs. ECT. In this case, for longer-term 
487 
training goals that are primarily reliant on hypertrophic, rather than neural, adaptations 
488 
loading duration may become the key training variable. These findings may have relevance 
489 
for athletic and patient groups where increasing muscle volume is a primary training goal. 
490 
 
491 
Early-phase (first 100 ms) explosive strength increased more after ECT than SCT. In contrast, 
492 
later-phase explosive strength (T150) was enhanced after both types of training. The 
493 
improvements in T50 and T100 following ECT in the current study are consistent with our 
494 
  
21 
previous observation that early-phase explosive strength adaptations were highly specific to 
495 
4-weeks of ECT vs. SCT (45), and demonstrates this to also be the case with more prolonged 
496 
(12-wks) training. The loading rate (peak RTD) during the short explosive contractions of 
497 
ECT was almost 6-fold greater than SCT, and therefore, high loading rates, rather than 
498 
loading magnitudes (similar for ECT and SCT) or duration (greater for SCT) appears to be 
499 
critical for enhancing early-phase explosive strength. Previous investigations of ECT have 
500 
consistently reported improvements in explosive strength (7, 22, 23, 41, 45, 48). In contrast, 
501 
training regimes similar to SCT in the current study have demonstrated both enhanced (1, 6, 9, 
502 
13, 29, 44) and unchanged (10, 40, 47) explosive strength. The inconsistent changes in 
503 
explosive strength in these studies may be partly explained by the variable training 
504 
instructions provided (e.g. an explosive component (13, 40, 44); no explosive component (6, 
505 
9, 47); or unclear (1, 29)). In our laboratory, we have consistently found no increase in early-
506 
phase explosive strength after 4 (47) and now 12 weeks of isometric SCT, as well as 3 and 12 
507 
weeks of dynamic SCT with isoinertial lifting and lowering (10, 19). Therefore for early-
508 
phase explosive strength gains a specific explosive component to the training, involving 
509 
contractions starting from a low/resting level and performing the rising phase of contraction 
510 
at a high rate, appears to be important.  
511 
 
512 
Neural drive during the early-phase of explosive contractions increased only after ECT 
513 
(EMG0-50 and EMG0-100; Table 2) and these changes were greater than for CON, but not SCT. 
514 
The Voluntary T50/Octet T50 ratio, which provides an alternate measure of early-phase neural 
515 
drive, increased from 42 to 53% after ECT, but this was not statistically significant due to the 
516 
large variability in response between participants. Qualitatively however, the group level 
517 
Voluntary T50/Octet T50 ratio response was notably larger after ECT (+26%) than SCT (-2%) 
518 
or CON (0%). Later-phase neural drive (EMG0-150) was increased after both types of training 
519 
  
22 
(Table 2). Overall, the current study shows neural adaptations during the early-phase of 
520 
explosive contraction that are specific to ECT, that had previously only been documented for 
521 
a 4-week training period (45), are still present following a more prolonged intervention. 
522 
Improvements in early-phase explosive torque production (T50 and T100) occurred after ECT 
523 
without increases in muscle size or early-phase intrinsic contractile capacity for explosive 
524 
torque production (Octet and Twitch T50), supporting the importance of neural drive 
525 
adaptations for the enhancement of early-phase explosive strength following training. 
526 
 
527 
Explosive torque and EMG expressed relative to corresponding maximum force and EMG 
528 
were unchanged with ECT but decreased with SCT (Tables 1-2 and Fig. 3 B and D); 
529 
highlighting further the comprehensive adaptations to ECT (i.e. proportional increases in both 
530 
explosive and maximum torques and corresponding neural drive) but not SCT (i.e. increases 
531 
in only maximum torque and neural drive). These changes after ECT partly oppose our 
532 
previous findings of a greater proportion of maximum strength and EMG being expressed 
533 
during explosive contractions after 4 weeks of ECT (45), that may be explained by the 
534 
apparent slowing of the contractile properties and/or greater changes in MVT, and neural 
535 
drive at MVT, after ECT in the current study. Neurologically, increases in instantaneous 
536 
motor unit discharge rates and the number of motor units able to produce high discharge rates 
537 
during explosive contractions and a degree of transfer of these adaptations to maximum 
538 
contractions may explain the increases in explosive (early- and late-phase) and maximum 
539 
neural drive after ECT (16, 17). In contrast, the low loading rates (385 Nm.s-1) but high 
540 
loading magnitudes (75%MVT) with SCT may have only stimulated adaptations in discharge 
541 
rate during the production of larger torques (i.e. the late-phase of explosive torque production 
542 
and the plateau phase of contraction) (27, 28). 
543 
 
544 
  
23 
Overall, ECT denoted by brief contractions with high RTD produced a wider range of 
545 
functional adaptations than SCT, with improvements in early- and late-phase explosive 
546 
strength, as well as maximum strength (Table 4). In contrast, SCT only improved maximum 
547 
strength and late-phase explosive strength (Table 4). The substantially lower loading duration 
548 
of ECT (7% of SCT) makes this a less-demanding training modality compared to SCT, which 
549 
may be preferentially tolerated by musculoskeletal patients and older adults. Future research 
550 
should investigate: (i) whether ECT may be preferentially tolerated by musculoskeletal 
551 
patients and older adults, and (ii) also evaluate the efficacy of ECT, and underpinning 
552 
neuromuscular adaptations, in an isoinertial dynamic training model that is more widely 
553 
accessible. 
554 
 
555 
The within-group increase in Octet Peak T following both ECT and SCT demonstrated an 
556 
increase in the maximum contractile capacity of the muscle-tendon unit, although between-
557 
group differences were not detected. In contrast, Twitch Peak T was unresponsive to training 
558 
even after SCT that induced hypertrophic adaptations. Changes in the time-course of evoked 
559 
responses (Octet and Twitch TPT as well as Relative Octet and Twitch T50) indicated an 
560 
overall slowing of the contractile properties of the muscle tendon unit after both types of 
561 
training. This apparent slowing of the intrinsic contractile properties is likely due to 
562 
decreased expression of myosin heavy chain type IIX fibres after training (2, 3, 11). For SCT, 
563 
the slower contractile properties may explain why during the early-phase of explosive 
564 
voluntary contraction relative torque decreased and absolute torque remained unchanged, 
565 
despite increases in maximum strength. After ECT the slower contractile properties may 
566 
explain why relative explosive torque remained unchanged despite improved neural drive, 
567 
and why the increases in absolute explosive torque were more modest than might have been 
568 
expected based on our previous 4-week training study (45) when presumably any potentially 
569 
  
24 
negative morphological changes would have been more limited. Furthermore, even after the 
570 
brief explosive contractions of ECT the intrinsic contractile properties of the muscle were 
571 
slowed, which might suggest that these changes may be unavoidable with strength training of 
572 
previously untrained individuals. 
573 
 
574 
In conclusion, functional, neural, and hypertrophic adaptations showed marked training 
575 
specificity. ECT produced wide ranging functional adaptations with increases in early- and 
576 
late-phase explosive and maximum strength due to neural adaptations, and the very low 
577 
loading duration of ECT (7% of SCT) makes this a substantially less demanding training 
578 
modality that may be preferentially tolerated by musculoskeletal patients and older adults. 
579 
SCT produced a greater improvement in maximum strength, but no improvements in early-
580 
phase explosive strength. The similar changes in neural drive at MVT after ECT and SCT 
581 
(despite a lesser gain in MVT following ECT) indicate that this adaptation is largely 
582 
dependent on loading magnitude. In contrast the ~3-fold greater hypertrophy after SCT than 
583 
ECT indicates that this adaptation is dependent on loading duration. Improvements in early-
584 
phase explosive torque production (≤100 ms) appear to rely on a high RTD to induce specific 
585 
neural adaptations. Finally, an apparent slowing of the intrinsic contractile properties of the 
586 
muscle-tendon unit after both types of training likely compromises improvements in 
587 
explosive strength.

Data are mean ± SD. Within-group effects of training were determined from paired t tests and are denoted by: * 
(P< 0.05), ** (P< 0.01), or *** (P< 0.001). ANCOVA interaction effects of time (pre vs. post) x group (ECT vs. 
SCT vs. CON) are reported. Relative octet and twitch measures are expressed as percentage of peak torque 
during these contractions. Participant numbers for: octet variables, ECT, n=12; SCT, n=14; CON, n=11; twitch 
variables, ECT, n=13; SCT, n=16; CON, n=14. ECT, explosive-contraction strength training; SCT, sustained-
contraction strength training; CON, control.
