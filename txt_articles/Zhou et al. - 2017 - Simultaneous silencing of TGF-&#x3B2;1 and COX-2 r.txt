ABSTRACT
Excessive skin scars due to elective operations or trauma represent a challenging 
clinical problem. Pathophysiology of hypertrophic scars entails a prolonged inflammatory 
and proliferative phase of wound healing. Over expression of TGF-β1 and COX-2 play key 
regulatory roles of the aberrant fibrogenic responses and proinflammatory mediators. 
When we silenced TGF-β1 and COX-2 expression simultaneously in primary human 
fibroblasts, a marked increase in the apoptotic cell population occurred in contrast to 
those only treated with either TGF-β1 or COX-2 siRNA alone. Furthermore, using human 
hypertrophic scar and skin graft implant models in mice, we observed significant size 
reductions of the implanted tissues following intra-scar administration of TGF-β1/
COX-2 specific siRNA combination packaged with Histidine Lysine Polymer (HKP). Gene 
expression analyses of those treated tissues revealed silencing of the target gene 
along with down regulations of pro-fibrotic factors such as α-SMA, hydroxyproline acid, 
Collagen 1 and Collagen 3. Using TUNEL assay detection, we found that the human 
fibroblasts in the implanted tissues treated with the TGF-β1/COX-2siRNAs combination 
exhibited significant apoptotic activity. Therefore we conclude that a synergistic effect 
of the TGF-β1/COX-2siRNAs combination contributed to the size reductions of the 
hypertrophic scar implants, through activation of fibroblast apoptosis and re-balancing 
between scar tissue deposition and degradation.
INTRODUCTION
Human hypertrophic scar reduction and management 
are major therapeutic challenges due to lack of in-depth 
understanding of the underlying mechanism and the few 
validated treatment strategies available [1]. Understanding 
the pathophysiology of fibrosis may lead to a novel 
therapeutic with improved clinical benefit [2]. Fibrosis 
is defined by excessive accumulation of extracellular 
matrix (ECM) in and around the damaged tissue, which 
can lead to permanent scarring [3]. Hypertrophic scar (HS) 
is the result of a disrupted balance between ECM protein 
deposition and degradation during the dermal wound 
healing process [4]. It is characterized by the prolonged 
inflammatory response to injury resulting in an increased 
vascularization, hypercellularity and excessive collagen 
                                                             Research Paper

deposition from local fibroblasts [5]. Fibroblasts are the 
most common cells in connective tissue, playing a key role 
in the wound healing process and can differentiate into 
myofibroblasts that results in increased ECM synthesis 
and tissue contraction [6, 7]. 
HS fibroblasts (HSFs) have demonstrated reduced 
collagenase expression [8], but elevated expression of 
TGF-β1, which lead to an excessive deposition of collagen 
resulting in HS formation [9, 10]. HS myofibroblasts 
are less sensitive to apoptotic signals but exhibit high 
expression levels of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). 
Abundant evidence has indisputably confirmed the central 
role of TGF-β1 in driving fibrosis and HS, especially 
when secreted from macrophages and fibroblasts [11]. In 
contrast, the role of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesized 
by cyclooxygenases (COX-2) during wound healing, 
is highly controversial. Although in vitro studies have 
provided some evidence to support a negative feedback 
loop, in that high levels of COX-2 and PGE2 expressions 
can inhibit TGF-β1-mediated fibrogenesis activities 
in various cell types, it has been suggested that these 
observations are due to the terminal stages of the cells 
used and do not reflect the early responses of TGF-β1 and 
COX-2 pathways to the injury in vivo [12]. In addition, 
animal studies that demonstrated lower PGE2 and COX2 
expression associated with reduced collagen synthesis in 
scarless fetal wounds [13] suggests that COX-2 could be a 
potential therapeutic target for limiting scar formation [14].
Studies with many treatment modalities for 
excessive scarring have not achieved satisfying remission. 
Those treatments included surgical excision, radiation, 
corticosteroid injections, cryotherapy, laser vaporization, 
topical 5-fluorouracil, bleomycin injection, paper tape to 
eliminate scar tension, pressure garment therapy, silicone 
gel sheeting, and short term use of ozonated oil. Several 
novel therapeutic modalities are also in development 
including TGF-β1 antagonists, exogenous PGE2, stem cell 
therapy and antisense to Connective Tissue Growth Factor 
(CTGF), encouraged by emerging preliminary findings in 
both animal models and human studies, EXC001 [15] 
and RXI109 [16]. To determine whether simultaneous 
targeting of TGF-β1 and COX2 could improve outcomes 
in HS, we designed two siRNA duplexes specific to 
TGF-β1 and COX-2 mRNA sequences and tested them in 
human fibroblasts and human HS tissue implants mouse 
models. 
Efficient siRNA delivery into skin wound site or HS 
tissue is required to achieve a significant therapeutic effect, 
and at the same time, minimize “off-target” and other 
immune stimulation side effects. One previous approach 
we developed is using a biodegradable polypeptide 
molecule, Histidine-Lysine co-Polymer (HKP), to package 
siRNA oligonucleotides into nanoparticles for enhancing 
siRNA delivery in vivo [17, 18]. To improve intradermal 
administration, we developed a process to formulate HKP 
with the selected siRNA duplexes targeting both TGF-β1 
and COX-2 into a nanoparticle aqueous suspension. 
Intradermal injection of the HKP-siRNA nanoparticle 
resulted in a synergistic reduction in the size of the 
hypertrophic scar. Here we provide the first report that a 
novel dual-targeted siRNA therapeutic approach exhibits 
potent anti-fibrotic activity with a newly discovered 
mechanism of action. 
RESULTS
Simultaneous silencing of TGF-β1 and COX-2 
induces human fibroblast apoptosis in vitro 
We first designed siRNA sequences specific to 
human TGF-β1 and COX-2 mRNAs in silico and then 
tested the efficacy of these sequences based on cell 
transfection and analysis using qRT-PCR (Tables 1–2). The 
siRNAs were selected based on their silencing efficiencies 
and toxicity profiles affecting cells (Figure 1A–1B). 
When human fibroblasts isolated from the hypertrophic 
scar tissue were transfected with the selected siRNAs 
targeting either TGF-β1 or COX-2 individually or in 
combination, we observed an efficient siRNA entry 
(Supplementary Figure 1) into the cells at different 
stages, from initial endocytosis to endosome release of 
the siRNAs. The measurements of target gene silencing 
after the transfection indicated significant knockdown 
of target gene expression, with either TGF-β1siRNA or 
COX-2siRNA themselves, or upon combination TGF-β1/
COX-2siRNAs. Interestingly, not only TGF-β1siRNA and 
TGF-β1/COX-2siRNAs combination were able to silence 
TGF-β1 expression, the COX-2siRNA was also able to 
down regulate TGF-β1 expression. This result suggests 
a potential interconnection between TGF-β1 and COX-2 
 
pathways. Similarly, TGF-β1siRNA was also able to 
silence COX-2 expression significantly. As the target 
genes were silenced, other pro-fibrotic factors such as 
α-SMA, Collagen 1 (Col1A1) and Collagen 3 (Col3A1) 
were also down regulated in the cells (Figure 1C). Cells 
treated with HKP alone and with NC siRNAs served as 
control. These results indicate that silencing TGF-β1 and 
COX-2 simultaneously in the fibroblasts down regulated 
multiple pro-fibrotic factors. 
We further investigated the fate of the fibroblasts 
when those pro-fibrotic factors were down regulated. 
Electron microscope images (Figure 1D) of the fibroblast 
cells transfected with the either TGF-β1siRNA or COX-
2siRNA only, or TGF-β1/COX-2siRNAs combination, 
illustrated that the combination treatment induced 
apoptosis in fibroblasts, but apoptosis was not induced 
with individual siRNA treatments. FACS analyses 
of the HSFs treated with the TGF-β1/COX-2siRNAs 
combination revealed a marked increase in the apoptotic 
cell population (Figure 2A), compared to those treated 
with either TGF-β1siRNA or COX-2siRNA individually.

combination showed much lower cell density and a 
different morphology (narrow cell shape (Figure 2B)). 
When we examined the expression of α-SMA protein in 
the human fibroblasts after the TGF-β1/COX-2siRNAs 
combination treatment, a significant reduction was 
observed compared to the individual siRNA treatments as 
measured by immunofluorescence staining (Figure 2C). 
Inhibitors of TGFβ receptor type I (TBR1) and COX2 
were also used to validate the effects of abrogating 
TGF-β1 and COX2 function which down-regulated 
fibrotic factors expression and promoted cell apoptosis 
on HSFs (Supplementary Figure 2). To explore the role 
of COX2 in modulating the activation of TGFβ signaling 
pathway, we used COX2-siRNA and pcDNA3.1-COX2 
over expression vector respectively. When transfected 
with COX2-siRNA, we observed a decreased expression 
level of canonical TGFβ signaling pathway downstream 
proteins, SMAD2/3, phosphorylated SMAD2/3(indicative 
of active TGFβ signaling) and PAI-1 (TGF-β1 target gene) 
by Western blot; this verified that COX2 modulated the 
TGFβ signaling pathway (Figure 2D). We also measured 
the level of hydroxyproline acid (HPC) in cell culture, an 
indicator of the synthetic activity of ECM proteins and a 
hallmark of tissue fibrosis, using human fibroblasts treated 
with TGF-β1/COX-2siRNAs combination (Supplementary 
Figure 3). Together, the results clearly indicate that when 
TGF-β1 and COX-2 gene expressions in the human 
fibroblasts were silenced simultaneously, down regulations 
of multiple fibrotic factors occurred. Consequently, the 
treated fibroblasts became less active and more apoptotic.

HKP enhances siRNA delivery into human 
hypertrophic scar
To ensure efficient siRNA delivery to the 
hypertrophic scar, we selected a biodegradable histidine-
lysine polypeptides (HKP) that has been demonstrated to 
provide efficient siRNA delivery in vivo [17, 18]. When 
HKP and siRNA are mixed in aqueous solution with an 
optimized N/P ratio (4/1; weight/weight), self-assembly 
of nanoparticles occurs through electrostatic and non-
ionic bonds. These nanoparticles can be lyophilized into 
dry powder and then re-formulated with aqueous solution 
(Figure 3A, Supplementary Figure 4). The lyophilized 
HKP (TGF-β1/COX-2siRNA) nanoplex powder once re-

constituted has an average size about 150 nm in diameter 
and a Zeta potential about 40 mV; the nanoparticles are 
stable at 4°C, exhibiting potent silencing activity for 
TGF-β1 up to 12 months (data not shown). 
To further understand the duration and distribution 
of the locally delivered siRNA, we used a human 
hypertrophic scar tissue implant mouse model. qRT-PCR 
analysis of the tissue samples from HKP (TGF-β1/COX-
2siRNAS) treatments revealed TGF-β1 knockdown and 
COX-2 knockdown in a dose-dependent manner. For 
TGF-β1, the decrease was greater between 24–48 hours, 
whereas for COX-2, the decrease was greater between 48 
and 96 hours post treatment (Figure 3B). Furthermore, 
two intrascar injections were conducted with one 
containing a naked Alexa Fluor labeled-siRNA and the 
other one containing the HKP packaged Alexa Fluor 
labeled-siRNA nanoparticle formulation. Tissue samples 
were collected at 4 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours post 
treatment injections, and analyzed under a Fluorescence 
microscope (Figure 3C). The naked siRNA is quickly 
dispersed after being injected into the scar tissue, and 
could not be detected after 24 hours. The HKP-packaged 
siRNA illustrated a quick dispersion and lasting release 
that can be detected even after 48 hours. Therefore, 
we predicted that HKP-packaged siRNA nanoparticle 
formulation represents a useful means for evaluation of 
the target gene silencing in vivo. When HKP-packaged 
TGF-β1/COX-2siRNAs combination was administrated 
through an intrascar injection, we observed potent 
silencing on days 1, 3 and 5 post treatment. This silencing 
activity resulted in parallel down regulation of both 
TGF-β1 and COX-2 with the greatest inhibition being 
seen at day 5 (Figure 3D). Examination of TGF-β1 and 
COX-2 mRNA by qRT-PCR showed a higher expression 
of both target genes in HS than in normal skin tissues 
(Figure 3E).

HKP-packaged TGF-β1/COX-2 siRNA (STP705) 
reduces size of human hypertrophic scar 
As expected, we found that TGF-β1 and COX-2 
were significantly over-expressed in human hypertrophic 
scar (HS) tissue from patients compared to normal 
skin tissue (Figure 4A). Human HS tissues were 
implanted onto nude mice subcutaneously for studying 
the pathophysiology of HS and the efficacy of siRNA 
silencing. After HS tissue was implanted, we analyzed 
these tissues at day 7, day 14 and day 28 post implantation. 
We then isolated mRNA from the tissue samples to 
determine the expression dynamics of TGF-β1, COX-2 
 
and α-SMA using qRT-PCR analyses (Figure 4B). The 
expression of TGF-β1 and COX-2 in the implanted human 
scar tissues exhibited an unexpected pattern with a rapid 
increase of TGF-β1 versus a steady increase in COX-2. 
The TGF-β1 expression reached a peak level at day 14 
while COX-2 expression was still up regulated on day 28 
post implantation.
Based on the results from Figure 3D and Figure 4B, 
we initiated treatment on the implanted human 
hypertrophic scars on mice four weeks after surgery. A 
20 µg/50 µl /cm3 HKP (TGF-β1/COX-2siRNAs) was 
administered to each scar implant using 5 aliquots into 
5 different sites of the scar, with three repeated injections 
at 5 days intervals. The STP705 combination treated HS 
implants showed a significant reduction in size of implanted 
tissues at day 28 post-treatment (Figure 4C–4D), by about 
45% compared to the untreated group. After tissue samples 
from those implants were further analyzed, we found that 
not only the targeted genes TGF-β1 and COX-2 were 
significantly silenced based on the qRT-PCR results, 
but other proteins such as α-SMA and col1A1 were also

revealed HKP packaged TGF-β1/COX-2siRNAs knocking down TGF-β1 and COX-2 in a dose-dependent manner. Whereas TGF-β1 was 
down regulated more between 24–48 hours post treatment, COX-2 decreased more between 48 and 96 hours post treatment (n = 6). NS is

human hypertrophic scar implant. (D) Injections of HKP (TGF-β1/COX-2siRNAS) nanoparticle solution into the human hypertrophic scar 
resulted in down regulations of TGF-β1 and COX-2 expressions in the tissue, up to 5 days, based on the qRT-PCR analyses. (E) Comparison

significantly down regulated (Figure 4E). This result 
provided strong evidence that the simultaneous inhibition 
of TGF-β1 and COX-2 enhanced scar reduction. 
STP705 reduces size of human skin grafts 
Similar to human hypertrophic scar implants, human 
skin grafted onto the nude mouse is able to regenerate 
after being subjected to a full-thickness wound. This 
approach has been used to determine the cells involved in 
the connective tissue repair process following superficial 
wound injury. In addition, this model has been used 
to study the wound healing process of human skin. 
Whereas the hypertrophic scar model was established by 
transplanting hypertrophic scars with both macroscopic 
and histologic properties similar to human scars, this model 
ensures observing the entire process of hypertrophic scar 
formation. Thus it is ideal for studying hypertrophic scar 
[19]. The initial time and dosing regimens were similar to 
the treatment of the implanted human hypertrophic scars 
on mice. Four weeks after the surgery, 20 µg/50 µl/cm3 
STP705 solution was injected into each skin graft using 5 
aliquots to 5 different sites of the graft, with three repeated 
injections at 5 days intervals. The HKP (TGF-β1/COX-
2siRNAs) combination treated human skin grafts resulted 
in a significant size reduction at day 28 post-treatment 
(Figure 5A–5B), by about 40% compared to the untreated 
group. After tissue samples from skin grafts were further 
analyzed, we found that not only the targeted genes, 
TGF-β1 and COX-2, were significantly silenced based on 
qRT-PCR analysis but that α-SMA and col1A1 were also 
significantly down regulated (Figure 5C). This result is

similar to what we observed with the human hypertrophic 
scar implants and provides further evidence that 
simultaneous silencing of TGF-β1 and COX-2 enhances 
scar reduction. 
STP705 demonstrates a novel anti-fibrotic 
mechanism of action 
To investigate the underlying biology of the observed 
scar tissue reductions with the human hypertrophic scar 
and human skin graft implants after STP705 treatment, we 
first measured hydroxyproline acid level from the tissue 
samples and then measured the differences between the 
treated and control groups. In both human scar and skin 
implants, STP705 treatment resulted in a significant down 
regulation of expression in hydroxyproline, compared 
to the control group (Figure 6A–6B). Furthermore, we 
compared treated (HKP -TGF-β1/COX-2siRNAs) and 
untreated tissues using H&E, or Masson’s trichrome 
staining, or immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining against 
human α-SMA, VEGF and CD3. The marked differences 
of the tissue structures and expression levels of these

pro-fibrotic factors were demonstrated (Figure 6C). We 
further measured the apoptotic activity of the fibroblasts 
in vivo as we did in the cell culture study, using a TUNEL 
assay. Histology images illustrated a marked increase 
in apoptosis of fibroblasts in the treated tissue samples 
(Figure 6D). Further quantitative analysis confirmed a 
significant increase of the numbers of apoptotic cells 
(Figure 6E). 
DISCUSSION
A dermal wound healing process can be classified 
into three phases: inflammation, cell proliferation and 
matrix remodeling, which involve multiple interactions 
within a complex network of pro-fibrotic and anti-fibrotic 
molecules [20]. After dermal injury occurs, the aggregated 
inflammatory cells become sources of growth factors and 
key enzymes of inflammatory cytokines such as COX2 
are induced during the inflammatory phase. Fibroblasts 
are the most common cells in connective tissue and key 
players in skin wound healing process especially during 
the proliferation and remodeling phase, functioning to 
maintain the physical integrity of the connective tissue, 
participate in wound closure, and produce and remodel 
ECM [21]. When active angiogenesis and collagen 
synthesis ensue in concert with the tissue remodeling 
process, a delicate balance of deposition and degradation 
of fibroblast-expressed ECM determines normal skin 
wound healing or whether a wound heals but with HS.

to myofibroblasts, and their apoptotic activity during 
the wound healing process can be critical modalities for 
therapeutic intervention.
Since TGF-β1 has been regarded as the critical 
factor regulating activation and proliferation of 
fibroblasts, inhibition of TGF-β1 is well accepted for 
targeted therapeutic approach against fibrotic scarring, 
and in fact, several candidate agents are currently in the 
clinical studies [22–26]. COX-2 and its major product, 
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), are generally considered potent 
pro-inflammatory and proliferative mediators. Through a 
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A/B (HNRPAB), 
TGF-β1 coordinately up-regulates COX-2 expression 
in murine fibroblasts [27]. We also found that silencing 
TGF-β1 in human fibroblasts down regulates COX-2 
expression, and vice versa (Figure 1C). Down-regulation 
of COX2 decreased the expression levels of SMAD2/3 
and phosphorylated SMAD2/3, indicating that COX2 
modulates the activation of TGF-β signaling pathway 
(Figures 2D, 6F). Although there are reports indicating that 
high levels of COX-2 transformed TGF-β1 into an anti-
fibrotic regulator in cell culture studies, these observations 
may be due to the terminal stages of the cells used and 
may not reflect the early responses of TGF-β1 and COX-
2 pathways to injury in vivo [12]. Moreover, evidence of 
increased expression of these two targets (TGF-β1 and 
COX-2) in the human hypertrophic scar tissue (Figure 
3E) warranted our selection of these targets for therapeutic 
intervention. In addition, fetal wound healing studies in 
mice have demonstrated that reduced PGE2 and COX2 
levels [13] resulted in lower collagen synthesis, suggesting 
that targeting COX-2 may be a potential therapeutic 
approach for limiting scar formation [14].
Recently, small interfering RNA targeting different 
signal molecules such as TERT [28], TGFBRI [29] 
and TIMP1 [30] demonstrated their ability to inhibit 
extracellular matrix deposition and the growth of 
fibroblasts in the scar. However, siRNA cannot readily 
penetrate the barriers of epidermis to reach fibroblasts 
in deep scar tissue. This transport barrier is a significant 
limiting factor to translate of RNA interference therapy 
in the clinical setting [31], and consequently, an efficient 
siRNA delivery in vivo is critical for the success of an 
siRNA-based drug. In our study, we evaluated the HKP-
siRNA nanoparticle formulation through intradermal 
(intrascar) administrations, to determine whether a 
clinically viable siRNA therapeutic product can be realized 
for treatment of the skin hypertrophic scar [19, 32]. We 
have developed scalable procedures for HKP (siRNA) 
nanoparticle formulation, which not only facilitated 
efficient siRNA delivery but exhibited no signs of adverse 
and toxic effects. In comparison with two ongoing clinical 
studies using oligonucleotide inhibitors for the similar 
indications, EXC001 and RXI109, the therapeutic dose of 
STP705 formulation was at least 2 logs below what has 
been reported for these 2 other agents (data not shown). 
We believe that the enhanced potency of STP705 observed 
in this study comes not only from the dual-targeted drug 
design but also from HKP-enhanced delivery to the site of 
action (Figure 3B). 
The therapeutic benefits observed in the human 
hypertrophic scar models of this further validates the 
benefit of simultaneous silencing of of two target genes. 
Using HKP-enhanced in vivo siRNA deliveries through 
intrascar injection, we observed significant silencing 
effects on TGF-β1 and COX-2 expressions by about 
40% (Figures 4E, 5C), with only microgram level of the 
siRNA inhibitors. These results support higher transfection 
efficiency of HKP packaged siRNA nanoparticles than 
other vehicles mediated treatments [33]. Moreover, 
apoptosis of fibroblasts in hypertrophic scars [34] has 
been seen with various therapies in prior studies. In this 
research, the activation and upregulation of fibroblast 
apoptosis within human hypertrophic scars both in vitro 
(Figure 2A) and in vivo (Figure 6D–6E) after STP705 
treatment revealed a novel underlying mechanism of 
action. The injection of HKP-packaged scrambled siRNA 
into the skin of normal mice showed no significant changes 
(data not shown). Additionally, cells treated with and 
without scrambled siRNAs gave similar results in vitro, 
suggesting that the effects of STP705 were not caused by 
non-specific gene silencing. Therefore, we hypothesize 
that simultaneously silencing of TGF-β1 and COX-2 
within the human hypertrophic scars were able to inhibit 
inflammatory activity and proliferation of fibroblasts. This 
inhibition leads to reduced ECM deposition and enhanced 
collagen degradation which is consistent with studies in 
other fibrosis diseases [35]. These results indicate that 
STP705 is a clinically viable novel siRNA therapeutic to 
reduce human skin hypertrophic scarring.
The up regulation of fibroblast apoptosis in the 
cell culture and human HS and skin tissue implants 
confirmed the therapeutic potential of STP705 to avoid 
fibrotic scarring, by maintaining an optimized fibroblast 
proliferation and a balance between deposition and 
degradation of ECM production. Down regulation of 
α-SMA, Collagen 1, Collagen 3 and hydroxproline acid in 
both human fibroblasts and HS tissue, at both mRNA and 
protein levels after the treatments, implicates a complex 
network regulating skin fibrotic scarring. The results from 
this study have further advanced our understanding of the 
mechanism of actions of the pathophysiological pathways 
involved in the hypertrophic scar formation. The in vivo 
study showed a thinning of the epidermal layer in the 
STP705 treatment group, yet it is unclear whether this 
phenotype was caused by RNAi-mediated target gene 
knockdown or by the formulation. Further studies will 
be carried out to investigate the influence of STP705 on 
epidermis. Although side effects of STP705 need to be 
intensively studied, the synergistic activity of STP705 
silencing both TGF-β1 and COX-2 at the proliferation 
stage and remodeling stage of skin wound healing process

provides solid evidence that the skin hypertrophic scar 
formation can be potentially reversed through modulating 
the activity of fibroblasts within the scar. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sequence design and selection
25-mer blunt-ended siRNA duplexes targeting 
homologues regions of human, mouse and porcine TGF-β1 
or Cox-2 mRNA sequences were designed (Table 1). Eight 
siRNA for each gene were screened in human PC3 cells. 
Briefly, 2.5x105 PC3 cells were seeded on the wells of 
6-wells plates on the day before transfection in 2 ml of 
ATCC optimized medium supplemented with 10% of 
fetal bovine serum. On the next day cells were transfected 
with Lipofectamin2000 (Invitrogen, CA) packaged siRNA 
complexes according to the manufacture’s recommendation. 
After 48-hours incubation, total RNAs were isolated from 
the cells with RNAqueous-4 PCR kit (Ambion, TX) 
followed by qRT-PCR analyses. Based on the potencies 
of target gene silencing of each siRNA sequence, the most 
potent siRNA was selected for future tests.

Cell culture 
Human PC3 cells (prostate adenocarcinoma) was 
purchased from the ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in 
ATCC-formulated F-12K medium with 10% fetal bovine 
serum (FBS). HS tissues were cut into small pieces of 
0.5–1 mm3.and incubated for 2–4 hours with 0.25% type I 
collagenase until tissue became flocculent. Following 
incubation cells were pressed through a sterile nylon 
mesh, washed with PBS and cultured in DMEM medium 
with 20% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml 
 
streptomycin with incubation at 37°C in 5% CO2. 
This study was conducted according to the principles 
expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants 
in this study or their parents or legal guardians provided 
written informed consent for the collection of samples 
and subsequent analyses. Samples used in this study were 
listed in Table 2. The growth medium was changed every 
2–3 days and only low passage cultures (between passage 
3 and passage 6) were analyzed for further experiments. 
SiRNA or pcDNA3.1 plasmids transfected cells were 
collected after 48 hours, if not otherwise stated. Inhibitors 
of TBR1 and COX2 were added at a concentration of 
100 nmol/L and cells were incubated for 48 h before 
collected. 
Growth inhibition in vitro
Cells were seeded into the wells of 6-well plate at 
density 106 cells per well in 3 ml media. Six hours later, 
the media was replaced with fresh media containing 
HKP alone, HKP (TGF-β1/COX-2siRNAs), HKP (TGF-
β1siRNA), or HKP (COX-2siRNA) at concentrations 
of 10 ug/ml HKP loaded with 5ug/ml siRNA. For 
the Annexin V/PI assay, transfected fibroblasts were 
harvested and resuspended at a density 106 cells/ml and 
then washed with cold PBS twice. Cells were resuspended 
in 60 µl of binding buffer, and Annexin-V-FITC (4 ul; 
20 ug/ml) (Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit with Annexin V 
Alexa Fluor® 488 & Propidium Iodide, Invitrogen, CA) 
was added. Cells were incubated in dark on ice for 15 
minutes. Before processing, PI (4ul; 50ug/ml) was added 
to the suspension. For cell cycle analysis, the transfected 
fibroblasts were harvested and washed with PBS three 
times. Cells were fixed with 70% ethanol at 4°C overnight 
and then washed twice with PBS. Cell pellets were 
resuspended in propidium iodide (500 μl; 50 μg/ml) and 
kept at 4°C overnight. The suspension was run through a 
single cell sieve to make a single cell suspension, which 
was analyzed by FACS (EPICS Altra, BACKMAN 
COUNLTER, Holland).
Real-Time qPCR

using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription 
was performed using PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (Takara 
Bio) according to the manufacture’s protocols. Real-time 
quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR was performed 
using the SYBR Select Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) 
and an ABI 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied 
Biosystems). Primers used for Real-Time qPCR were 
listed in Table 3.

Western blotting analysis
Total cell lysates were prepared by solubilization 
in RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase 
inhibitors (Selleck Chemicals). Protein concentration 
was measured by the Bradford method. After 4%–20% 
SDS–PAGE, proteins were transferred to 0.45 um PVDF 
membranes (Millipore), blocked in 0.5% skim milk for 
1 h at room temperature, incubated overnight with the 
primary antibody and secondary antibody for 1 h, with 
three washes of 10 min in TBS plus 0.1% Tween-20 
after each incubation. The proteins recognized by the 
specific antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence 
methods (High-sig ECL Western Blotting Substrate, 
Tanon, China) using peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit 
secondary antibodies as mentioned above. Densitometric 
quantification was performed in unsaturated images using 
ImageJ (NIH).
Plasmid construction
The cDNA encoding the COX2 ORF was 
amplified by PCR using primers incorporating restriction 
enzyme sites (Hind III and XbaI) from NCBI online. 
The PCR fragment was cloned into the digested 
plasmids of pcDNA3.1 leading to the production 
of pcDNA3.1-COX2, with the following primers: 
COX2-sense: 
5′- 
TATAAGCTTCCCTCAGACAGC 
AAAGCCTA-3′ and COX2-antisense: 5′- CTAGTCTAGA 
CTACAGTTCAGTCGAACGTTCTTTTAG-3′. Plasmids 
 
were isolated and purified using anion exchange columns 
(QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and all constructs were 
sequenced. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine2000 
reagent (Invitrogen) according to the protocol from the 
manufacturer.
Detections of α-SMA and hydroxyproline acid 
The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 
10 minutes at room temperature and washed three times 
with PBS. Re-naturalization solution was added drop-
wise to designated area encircled by an indelible pen 
and incubated for 5 minutes. Subsequently, cells were 
incubated for 30 min in the permeabilization solution 
(PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100), washed with PBS three times 
and blocked with 10% goat serum for 1 hour. Cells were 
then incubated with anti-α-SMA antibody (1:100 dilution) 
at 4°C in a moisture box overnight. Cells stained with 
goat-anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200) at room 
temperature in dark for 30 minutes and counter-stained 
with DAPI at room temperature for 1 minute, washed 
with PBS and observed under a fluorescent microscope. 
Hydroxyproline Colorimetric Assay Kit (BioVision, USA) 
was used for detection of hydroxyproline accordingly to 
the manufacturer's instruction.
Nanoparticle preparation 
optimized Histidine-Lysine polymers (HKP) were 
used for siRNA delivery in vivo. One of HKPpeptides, 
H3K4b, having a lysine core with four branches that 
contain multiple repeats of histidines and lysines, was 
used for packaging siRNAs targeting TGF-β1 and COX-2. 
 
The HKP carrier: siRNA payload ratio was 4:1 by mass. 
The HKP and siRNA self-assembled into nanoparticles 
with an average size of 150 nm in diameter. These HKP 
(siRNA) nanoparticles suspended in an aqueous solution 
were injected into the scar tissue. 
SEM and TEM analyses 
A scanning electron microscopy was conducted 
when HKP (siRNA) nanoparticles were packaged as 
mentioned above. Samples for SEM were prepared by 
diluting above nanoparticle solutions to 0.1 mg/ml. 
Diluted samples were then dripped onto silicon wafers 
and air dried. The samples were then sputter-coated 
with a 2nm layer of a palladium /gold alloy. Pictures of 
nanoparticles were acquired under SEM (Hitach S-480, 
Japan) at 20°C, 60 RH (Figure 3A–3B). A transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted when the 
transfected cells were fixed with 2% osmic acid for one 
hour. Cells were dislodged with a rubber scratcher and 
collected by centrifugation. Cell pellets were sectioned 
and analyzed under TEM. TEM images were taken with 
a CM-120 Bio Twio (PHILIPS, Holland) (Supplementary 
Figure 1).

Human hypertrophic scar tissue implant model
Skin hypertrophic scar tissue was obtained 
from a surgical excision with the informed consent 
and was trimmed off subcutaneous fat and cut into 
pieces of 2 cm2. 6–8 weeks old male nude mouse was 
anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate and a piece of 
trimmed hypertrophic scar tissue was implanted under 
the skin on the mouse back. Scar tissue was fixed to 
the mouse deep fascia with 4–5 sutures before skin 
was closed. 
Human skin tissue grafting model
The tissue samples used in experiments were 
from skin excisions of three women (ages 23–36) that 
had undergone breast reconstruction for treatment of 
macromastia. All patients had signed the informed 
consent voluntarily. Skin excisions were acquired in 
sterile condition, cut into size of 2 cm × 1.6 cm and 
kept in 20% FBS DMEM media at 4ºC before use. 
Male nude mice of 6–8 weeks old were anesthetized 
with 10% chloral hydrate and a piece of skin (2 cm × 
1.6 cm) was excised from the back. A same size human 
skin was grafted to replace the excision by sutures 
to subcutaneous fascia and surrounding mouse skin. 
A stack of sterile cotton was placed on the top of the 
graft and tightly wrapped. Stitches were taken off two 
weeks later. 
Quantification of therapeutic effects in vivo
Four weeks after the human hypertrophic scar 
implantation, 20 ug/50 µl/cm3 of HKP (TGF-β1/COX-
2siRNAs) was injected into the scar established on 
the mouse body. To ensure even drug distributions, 
injections were performed into 5 areas - 4 quadrants 
and 1 center. Every dose of the drug was injected in 
5 equal aliquots. Scars were injected three times 
for the period of 15 days (once per 5 day). Scar size 
was evaluated before and after treatment. At day 1, 
2, 5 and at the end of the experiment animals were 
euthanized, and scar tissue was immediately harvested 
and homogenized in Trizol solution with Polytrone 
(Brinkmann Homogenizer Polytron PT 10/35). Total 
RNA was extracted and RNA level of TGF-β1, COX-
2, α-SMA, Col1a1, and Col3a1 was analyzed by qRT-
PCR. The in situ Cell Death Detection Kit from Roche 
(South San Francisco, CA, USA) was used for detection 
of apoptotic cells from the STP705 treated scar tissues, 
following the vendor’s instruction. 
Statistical analysis
Mean ± SD was used for cell culture results, and 
mean ± SE was used for in vivo results. Student’s t- test 
was used to determine significance between two groups. 
P- values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. 
IBM SPSS statistics ver. 20 was used for statistical 
analysis.
