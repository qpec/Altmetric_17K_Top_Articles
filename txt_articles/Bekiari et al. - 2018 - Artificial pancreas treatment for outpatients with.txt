ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of artificial 
pancreas treatment in non-pregnant outpatients with 
type 1 diabetes.
DESIGN
Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised 
controlled trials.
DATA SOURCES
Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and grey 
literature up to 2 February 2018.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES
Randomised controlled trials in non-pregnant 
outpatients with type 1 diabetes that compared the 
use of any artificial pancreas system with any type 
of insulin based treatment. Primary outcome was 
proportion (%) of time that sensor glucose level 
was within the near normoglycaemic range (3.9-10 
mmol/L). Secondary outcomes included proportion 
(%) of time that sensor glucose level was above 10 
mmol/L or below 3.9 mmol/L, low blood glucose 
index overnight, mean sensor glucose level, total 
daily insulin needs, and glycated haemoglobin. The 
Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool was used to 
assess study quality.
RESULTS
40 studies (1027 participants with data for 44 
comparisons) were included in the meta-analysis. 
35 comparisons assessed a single hormone artificial 
pancreas system, whereas nine comparisons 
assessed a dual hormone system. Only nine studies 
were at low risk of bias. Proportion of time in the 
near normoglycaemic range (3.9-10.0 mmol/L) was 
significantly higher with artificial pancreas use, both 
overnight (weighted mean difference 15.15%, 95% 
confidence interval 12.21% to 18.09%) and over a 
24 hour period (9.62%, 7.54% to 11.7%). Artificial 
pancreas systems had a favourable effect on the 
proportion of time with sensor glucose level above 
10 mmol/L (−8.52%, −11.14% to −5.9%) or below 
3.9 mmol/L (−1.49%, −1.86% to −1.11%) over 24 
hours, compared with control treatment. Robustness 
of findings for the primary outcome was verified in 
sensitivity analyses, by including only trials at low 
risk of bias (11.64%, 9.1% to 14.18%) or trials under 
unsupervised, normal living conditions (10.42%, 
8.63% to 12.2%). Results were consistent in a 
subgroup analysis both for single hormone and dual 
hormone artificial pancreas systems.
CONCLUSIONS
Artificial pancreas systems are an efficacious and 
safe approach for treating outpatients with type 1 
diabetes. The main limitations of current research 
evidence on artificial pancreas systems are related 
to inconsistency in outcome reporting, small sample 
size, and short follow-up duration of individual trials.
Introduction
Despite substantial advances in the treatment of type 1 
diabetes, maintaining good glycaemic control without 
hypoglycaemia remains a challenge for patients 
at all ages and for healthcare providers. Currently, 
insulin treatment strategies in type 1 diabetes include 
either multiple daily insulin injections or continuous 
subcutaneous insulin infusion with an insulin pump. 
In 2008, the National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence concluded that continuous subcutaneous 
insulin infusion has a favourable effect on glycated 
haemoglobin (HbA1c) and incidence of hypoglycaemia 
in patients with type 1 diabetes.1 Moreover, a meta-
analysis of 19 trials concluded that continuous 
subcutaneous insulin infusion had a favourable effect 
on glycaemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes 
compared with multiple daily insulin injections.2 In 
addition, in a recent cluster randomised controlled 
trial, patients with type 1 diabetes who used continuous 
subcutaneous insulin infusion instead of multiple 
daily insulin injections reported additional benefits in 
quality of life and greater treatment satisfaction.3
Until recently, continuous subcutaneous insulin 
infusion was mostly guided by self-monitoring of 
capillary glucose testing.4 However, insulin pumps 
are now also used in conjunction with real time 
continuous glucose monitoring, hence allowing the

WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Individual studies have shown artificial pancreas use to be safe and efficacious 
in inpatients, patients under close monitoring, and outpatients with type 1 
diabetes
The US Food and Drug Administration recently approved artificial pancreas use 
for patients aged 14 years and older with type 1 diabetes
Previous meta-analyses on artificial pancreas systems have provided limited 
findings, mainly owing to the low number of studies incorporated and 
heterogeneous definitions of outcomes
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
In view of all the available evidence from randomised controlled trials, artificial 
pancreas treatment significantly improves glycaemic control while reducing the 
burden of hypoglycaemia in outpatients with type 1 diabetes
Results are consistent for people using artificial pancreas systems unsupervised 
under normal living conditions, and for both single hormone and dual hormone 
systems
The current research evidence on artificial pancreas systems is limited by 
inconsistency in outcome reporting, small sample size, and short follow-up 
duration of individual trials

patient to manually modify the insulin infusion rate 
according to continuous glucose monitoring values 
(known as sensor augmented pump treatment).4 5 The 
recent introduction of a low glucose suspend feature 
has allowed for automatic pump suspension when a 
preprogrammed threshold value of continuous glucose 
monitoring is reached.6 Based on a 2016 analysis, the 
use of sensor augmented pump treatment and the low 
glucose suspend feature was found to be cost effective 
compared with continuous subcutaneous insulin 
infusion and self-monitoring of blood glucose for 
patients with type 1 diabetes in the United Kingdom.7
Artificial pancreas treatment, also referred to as 
closed loop glucose control, is an emerging treatment 
option combining an insulin pump and continuous 
glucose monitoring with a control algorithm to deliver 
insulin in a glucose responsive manner (that is, a 
single hormone artificial pancreas system). Glucagon 
can also be delivered in a similar glucose responsive 
fashion, as accommodated by dual hormone artificial 
pancreas systems. Therefore, compared with insulin 
pumps or sensor augmented pumps, artificial 
pancreas use can reduce the burden for patients by 
automatically adjusting the amount of insulin entering 
the body on the basis of sensor glucose levels. Several 
artificial pancreas systems have been developed, and 
their safety and efficacy have been evaluated in many 
studies, showing promising results. An early pooled 
analysis included only four studies in an inpatient 
setting,8 whereas an overview published in 2015 
summarised existing data from randomised controlled 
trials up to September 2014.9 Finally, a recent meta-
analysis 
summarised 
evidence 
from 
published 
trials of artificial pancreas systems in outpatients 
with type 1 diabetes.10 Notably, the US Food and 
Drug Administration has recently approved the first 
artificial pancreas system for use by people with type 
1 diabetes over 14 years of age, based on a safety 
outpatient study.11 This systematic review and meta-
analysis aimed to summarise and critically appraise all 
existing evidence on the clinical efficacy and safety of 
artificial pancreas systems for the management of type 
1 diabetes in the outpatient setting.
Methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis is based 
on a prespecified protocol (appendix 1), and is 
reported according to the preferred reporting items 
for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) 
statement (appendix 2).12
Search strategy and selection criteria
We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Database 
of Systematic Reviews, and the Central Register of 
Controlled Trials from inception to 2 February 2018. 
Our search strategy was based on search terms 
describing the intervention (artificial pancreas or 
closed loop system) in addition to a filter for randomised 
trials. We omitted terms related to type 1 diabetes to 
avoid missing potentially relevant studies.13 14 We 
used search terms that had been identified from initial 
scoping searches, target references, and browsing of 
database thesauruses (web appendix 3). We imposed 
no restrictions based on language or publication status, 
searched ClinicalTrials.gov, and sought for additional 
studies from snowballing of included records.
We included randomised controlled trials in non-
pregnant adults, children, and adolescents with 
type 1 diabetes in the outpatient setting (including 
hotels, diabetes camps, or normal living conditions), 
irrespective of trial design (parallel or crossover) or 
duration of intervention, which compared artificial 
pancreas systems with any type of insulin based 
treatment. Such comparative treatments included 
multiple daily insulin injections, insulin pump 
treatment without continuous glucose monitoring 
or with blinded continuous glucoses monitoring, 
and sensor augmented pumps with or without a low 
glucose suspend feature.
Data extraction
References identified were imported into a reference 
management software (Endnote, Clarivate Analytics) 
for deduplication. Potentially eligible records were 
exported to Covidence (Covidence, Veritas Health 
Innovation) for screening. Three reviewers (EB, EA, 
and KK) working independently, screened all records 
in duplicate, and disagreements were arbitrated by 
a senior team member (AT). Initially, records were 
screened at title and abstract level, and potentially 
eligible studies were assessed in full text.
If multiple records of one study were retrieved, we 
collated data from all records, and used data from 
the report with the longest duration of follow-up. 
We extracted data for study and participant baseline 
characteristics, 
interventions, 
comparators, 
and 
clinical outcomes in duplicate (EB, EA, and TK) by 
using an electronic, pilot tested, data extraction 
form (web appendix 4). Disagreements were resolved 
by consensus or following discussion with a senior 
reviewer (AT).
Outcomes
The primary outcome was proportion (%) of time 
when the sensor glucose level was within the near 
normoglycaemic range (3.9-10 mmol/L). Secondary 
outcomes included proportion (%) of time when the 
sensor glucose level was above 10 mmol/L or below 
3.9 mmol/L, incidence of severe hypoglycaemia, mean 
sensor glucose level, total daily insulin needs, and 
glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). We also used low blood 
glucose index overnight as an additional outcome to 
assess hypoglycaemia. Low blood glucose index is 
a weighted average of the number of hypoglycaemic 
readings with progressively increasing weights as 
glucose levels decrease and is associated with the risk of 
hypoglycaemia and prediction of severe hypoglycaemic 
episodes.15 When available, for proportion (%) of time 
in the near normoglycaemic range, hyperglycaemia 
(>10 mmol/L), or hypoglycaemia (<3.9 mmol/L), we 
extracted data both for 24 hour and overnight periods 
(as defined in each individual study).

Statistical analysis
We conducted meta-analyses when data were available 
for at least two studies. We calculated weighted mean 
differences with 95% confidence intervals, applying an 
inverse variance weighted random effects model using 
the DerSimonian and Laird estimation method.16 We 
also calculated 95% prediction intervals to estimate 
a predicted range for the true treatment effect in 
any one individual study.17 In addition, to account 
for uncertainty related to heterogeneity estimates, 
we calculated 95% confidence intervals applying 
the Hartung Knapp correction method.18 For trials 
reporting only medians and interquartile ranges, 
we retrieved mean and variance values from authors 
of original reports or used appropriate formulas to 
calculate mean and variance, making no assumption on 
the distribution of the underlying data.19 We combined 
data both from parallel group and crossover studies. 
Finally, for crossover studies that reported their results 
as parallel group trials, we used appropriate methods 
to impute within patient differences.20
We conducted prespecified subgroup analyses based 
on the mode of use (overnight or over 24 hours) and type 
of artificial pancreas system (single or dual hormone). 
A series of a priori decided sensitivity analyses was 
conducted for the primary outcome, excluding trials 
at unclear or high risk of bias, trials recruiting people 
in diabetes camps, or trials with supervised use of 
artificial pancreas system. We assessed statistical 
heterogeneity by the χ2 based Cochran Q test and the 
τ2 and I2 statistics. For HbA1c, we synthesised only 
data from trials with at least eight weeks’ duration per 
intervention. All analyses were undertaken in RevMan 
5.3 (Nordic Cochrane Centre) and Stata 13.0 (Stata 
Corporation). 
Assessment of risk of bias in individual studies and 
across studies
Quality assessment was undertaken in duplicate by two 
independent reviewers (EB and EA), and disagreements 
were resolved by consensus or arbitrated by a third 
reviewer (AT). We used the Cochrane Collaboration 
risk of bias tool to assess risk of bias for the primary 
outcome for individual studies. For crossover studies, 
we also assessed a series of methodological challenges 
that are related to this specific design (appropriateness 
of crossover design, carry-over effects, unbiased 
data).21 We used results to provide an evaluation of 
the overall quality of the included studies (appendix 5) 
to inform a sensitivity analysis including only trials at 
low overall risk of bias.
We explored risk of bias across studies, both visually 
using a contour enhanced funnel plot, and formally 
using Egger’s statistical test.22 23 In case of evidence of 
small study effects, we used the trim and fill method as 
a sensitivity analysis, to provide an adjusted estimate 
of the meta-analysis.24
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in definition of the research 
question or the outcome measures, and interpretation 
or writing up of results. Data relating to the impact of 
the intervention on participants’ quality of life were not 
extracted. Where possible, results of this systematic 
review and meta-analysis will be disseminated to the 
patient community or individual patients and families 
through the investigators of this meta-analysis.
Results
Characteristics of included studies
Figure 1 shows the study selection process. Of 10 054 
records retrieved, 85 reports qualified for inclusion 
in our systematic review. After juxtaposing different 
reports that referred to the same study, 39 publications 
describing 41 trials (1042 participants with data for 
45 comparisons) were used to inform our systematic 
review.25-63 One trial did not report data for outcomes 
assessed and was not included in the meta-analysis.57
Table 1 shows characteristics of the 41 studies included 
in the systematic review and their participants at 
baseline. The clear majority of included trials used a 
crossover design,25-27 29-35 37-41 43-46 50-58 60-63 whereas 
only seven trials were of parallel design.28 36 42 47-49 59 
The duration of 36 trials lasted up to four weeks,25-41 43 
45-50 52-62 whereas the remaining five trials lasted from 
eight to 30 weeks.42 44 51 63 Seventeen trials recruited 
children or adolescents,28 30 32 35 36 38 41 49 50 53-57 60 61 63 
13 recruited adults,25 27 29 34 37 40 43-45 55 62 63 and 11 
recruited a mixed population.26 31 39 42 46-48 51 52 58 59 The 
artificial pancreas was used overnight in 16 trials,29 36 
38 39 41 44 46 50-53 57-59 62 63 and used over 24 hours in the 
remaining 25 trials.25-28 30-35 37 40 42 43 45 47-49 54-56 60 61 63 
In 32 trials, a single hormone artificial pancreas system 
was assessed (mostly versus unblinded treatment 
using sensor augmented pump).25 26 28-32 35-37 41-54 57-63

treatment (consisting of continuous subcutaneous 
insulin infusion combined with a blinded system of 
continuous glucose monitoring).27 34 55 56 Additionally,

did not provide relevant details. Participants’ mean 
age and HbA1c at baseline ranged from 7.0 to 47.0 
years and from 6.9% to 8.6%, respectively.
Risk of bias assessment results
Risk of bias assessment for the primary outcome is 
presented in appendices 6 and 7. Only nine studies 
were at low risk of bias. Most studies were deemed at 
high risk for bias, because either they reported median 
values instead of mean values, or reported results that 
required extensive use of imputation methods to be 
used in meta-analyses.
Primary outcome
All meta-analysis results are presented as summary 
effect estimates for artificial pancreas systems versus 
control treatment. Compared with control treatment, 
use of artificial pancreas was associated with an 
increased percentage of time (140 additional minutes) 
in near normoglycaemia (3.9-10.0 mmol/L) over 
24 hours (overall weighted mean difference 9.62% 
(95% confidence interval 7.54% to 11.7%); I2=78%, 
τ2=24.09, 32 studies). This effect was consistent both 
for trials using artificial pancreas overnight (7.16% 
(5.73% to 8.58%); 0%, 0.0, seven studies) or over 24 
hours (10.79% (7.88% to 13.7%); 81%, 39.21, 25 
studies; fig 2). The confidence interval for the overall 
effect estimate after applying the Hartung Knapp 
correction was 7.83% to 12.41%, whereas the 95% 
prediction interval was −0.63% to 19.87%. Of note, 
the 95% prediction interval was above zero when 
the artificial pancreas was used overnight (5.29% 
to 9.02%), suggesting that artificial pancreas use 
will be beneficial in at least 95% of the individual 
study settings when applied overnight. However, 
the prediction interval contained negative values 
when applied over 24 hours (−2.52% to 24.1%), and 
therefore might not be beneficial in some settings.
The favourable effect of artificial pancreas use over 
control treatment was more evident on the proportion 
of time in near normoglycaemia overnight (overall 
weighted mean difference 15.15% (95% confidence 
interval 12.21% to 18.09%); I2=73%, τ2=43.48, 31 
studies). This effect was consistent when artificial 
pancreas was used either only overnight (14.25% 
(11.13% to 17.37%); 63%, 19.39, 14 studies) or over 
24 hours (16.44% (10.88% to 22.01%); 78%, 99.63, 
17 studies; fig 3), even when the Hartung Knapp 
correction was applied (appendix 13). Respective 95% 
prediction intervals suggested that effect on time in 
near normoglycaemia overnight would be beneficial 
in at least 95% of the individual study settings when 
artificial pancreas was applied overnight (4.04% to 
24.45%), but not when applied over 24 hours (−5.68% 
to 38.56%).
Secondary outcmes
Use of artificial pancreas had a favourable effect on 
time in hyperglycaemia (glucose concentrations >10 
mmol/L) during the entire day. Compared with control 
treatment, this period was shortened by about two 
hours (overall weighted mean difference −8.52% (95% 
confidence interval −11.14% to −5.9%); I2=80%, 
τ2=28.98, 22 studies), both in trials using artificial 
pancreas overnight (−6.0% (−8.4% to −3.6%); 0%, 
0.0, three studies) and those using artificial pancreas 
over 24 hours (−9.08% (−12.23% to −5.93%); 83%, 
37.53, 19 studies; fig 4). Similarly, the time when 
glucose concentrations were higher than 10.0 mmol/L 
overnight was also shortened compared with control 
treatment (−11.12% (−13.8% to −8.44%); 71%, 
26.13, 23 studies), both in trials that used artificial 
pancreas either only overnight (−9.23% (−11.67% 
to −6.79%); 51%, 8.26, 12 studies) or over 24 hours 
(−13.86% (−19.83% to −7.9%); 80%, 77.07, 11 
studies; appendix 8).
Time when glucose concentrations were lower than 
3.9 mmol/L over a 24 hour period was shortened with 
artificial pancreas use by about 20 minutes (overall 
weighted mean difference −1.49% (95% confidence 
interval −1.86% to −1.11%); I2=74%, τ2=0.59, 29

studies), compared with control treatment (fig 5). 
Results were consistent for overnight time when 
concentrations were lower than 3.9 mmol/L (−2.22% 
(−2.78% to −1.65%); 72%, 1.34, 29 studies; appendix 
9). Data on incidence of severe hypoglycaemia (that 
is, hypoglycaemia requiring third party assistance) 
were available in 27 studies (804 patients). Overall, 
incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was very low both 
in groups using artificial pancreas (six episodes) and 
control treatment (three episodes). Use of artificial 
pancreas was also associated with a reduction in 
overnight low blood glucose index (−0.37 (−0.56 to 
−0.18); 85%, 0.06, 11 studies).
Compared with control treatment, use of artificial 
pancreas had a favourable effect on mean levels of 
sensor blood glucose over 24 hours, which fell by 
0.48 mmol/L (95% confidence interval 0.3 to 0.66; 
I2=84%, τ2=0.18, 32 studies; fig 6). Results were 
more favourable for mean levels of sensor blood 
glucose overnight (overall weighted mean difference 
−0.81 mmol/L (−1.03 to −0.6); 78%, 0.3, 35 studies; 
appendix 10). These findings were consistent with 
the effect of artificial pancreas use on HbA1c (−0.26% 
(−0.38% to −0.13%); 0%, 0.0, three studies; fig 7). 
Finally, no difference between artificial pancreas use 
and control treatment was seen in the mean daily

in 
near 
normoglycaemia were similar in a sensitivity analysis 
including only trials at low risk of bias, both over 24 
hours (overall weighted mean difference 11.64% (95% 
confidence interval 9.1% to 14.18%); 10 studies) 
and overnight (20.18% (13.18% to 27.19%); five 
studies; fig 8 and fig 9). Similarly, results for near 
normoglycaemia did not differ in a series of sensitivity 
analyses excluding trials that using artificial pancreas 
in diabetes camps or including only trials using artificial 
pancreas in unsupervised patients in normal living 
conditions. This similarity was seen both for the 24 hour 
period (10.42% (95% confidence interval 8.63% to 
12.2%) and 10.67% (8.33% to 13.01%), respectively; 
appendices 13 and 14) and overnight period (13.47% 
(10.41% to 16.54%) and 15.53% (10.12% to 20.94%), 
respectively; appendices 15 and 16).
We also did a post hoc sensitivity analysis excluding 
trials comparing artificial pancreas systems with low 
glucose suspend systems, to explore their effect on 
hypoglycaemia. Time when concentrations were lower 
than 3.9 mmol/L was shortened compared with control

treatment (overall weighted mean difference −1.59% 
(95% confidence interval −1.99% to −1.19%) for 24 
hour period, −2.53% (−3.18% to −1.87%) for overnight 
period; appendices 17 and 18). Finally, for all outcomes, 
results were consistent with those of the main analysis 
in a prespecified subgroup analysis based on type of 
artificial pancreas used (that is, single hormone versus 
dual hormone artificial pancreas; table 2).
Small study effects
Both visually and formally, no evidence of small study 
effects was seen for the proportion of time in near 
normoglycaemia over 24 hours (P=0.129). However, 
evidence of small study effects was seen (P<0.001) 
for the proportion of time in near normoglycaemia 
overnight, and visual inspection of the contour 
enhanced funnel plot suggested that small negative 
studies were missing (appendix 19). Nevertheless, 
the adjusted meta-analytical estimate after use of the 
trim and fill method remained in favour of artificial 
pancreas use (weighted mean difference 10.39% (95% 
confidence interval 7.30% to 13.49%), P<0.001).
discussion
Key findings
Our data suggest that use of artificial pancreas is 
associated with almost two and a half additional hours 
in near normoglycaemia over a 24 hour period compared 
with control treatment, mainly due to its favourable 
effect during the overnight period. This finding was 
also verified by its effect on time in hyperglycaemia (two 
hours less than control treatment) and in hypoglycaemia 
(20 minutes less). Results were robust both for single 
and dual hormone systems, and were consistent in all 
sensitivity analyses performed—including an analysis 
restricted to trials under normal living conditions 
without remote monitoring, supporting the convenience 
and ease of use of artificial pancreas systems. 
Finally, this favourable effect was also evident in the 
relative reduction of mean blood glucose levels by 0.48 
mmol/L, which is consistent with the HbA1c reduction of 
about 0.3% recorded in trials with a duration of more than 
eight weeks per intervention.44 63 64 Overall, our results 
reflect the progress made over recent decades of extensive 
research and development in artificial pancreas use.

Comparison with other studies
Despite heterogeneity in interventions and comparators 
used, our systematic review provides a valid and up to 
date overview on the use of artificial pancreas. An early 
pooled analysis of randomised controlled trials with 
artificial pancreas systems, published in 2011, included 
only four studies in an inpatient setting.8 The effect of 
artificial pancreas in the outpatient setting was examined 
in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 
24 randomised controlled trials (585 participants).10 
However, validity and clinical interpretation potential 
of the results were undermined by methodological 
decisions regarding the definition of outcomes, handling 
of median values, and exclusion of evidence from grey 
literature sources, potentially missing a substantial 
amount of evidence.65 Our systematic review and 
meta-analysis incorporated a much larger pool of 
eligible studies (n=41) and participants (n=1042) and 
assessed a broader variety of outcomes, focusing on 
outcome definitions considered most important in trials 
evaluating artificial pancreas systems.66-68
Furthermore, Weisman and colleagues analysed only 
24 hour outcomes for studies investigating artificial 
pancreas use for 24 hour periods and analysed only 
overnight outcomes for studies investigating artificial 
pancreas use overnight, even when individual 
trials provided data for both periods.10 Instead, our 
systematic review dealt with the research question

Strengths and limitations of study
Composition of the review team ensured appropriate 
methodological and field expertise, but also access to 
additional study data from individual studies.41 45 60-63 
To ensure internal validity of our conclusions, we 
implemented current guidelines for the conduct 
and reporting of systematic reviews,12 and adhered 
to a prespecified protocol with minimal deviations. 
We undertook a comprehensive search of multiple 
databases without imposing any restrictions based 
on language or publication type, and assessed quality 
of trials using valid methodological tools. Moreover, 
we synthesised existing data using appropriate 
methodology to account for inappropriate reporting 
and analysis methods used in some of the trials

included. In addition, we conducted a range of 
sensitivity analyses excluding trials using remote 
monitoring or trials at high risk of bias, to examine 
clinical relevance and robustness of our findings.
We acknowledge several limitations at the evidence 
and review level. Most trials had a small sample 
size, limiting the precision of our effect estimates. 
Despite using broad inclusion criteria, existing 
studies provided limited insight regarding clinically 
relevant subgroups, such as those with increased 
hypoglycaemia burden, hypoglycaemia unawareness, 
gastroparesis, blindness, high HbA1c, treated with 
corticosteroids, or from ethnic minorities.69 Many 
trials were at high or unclear risk of bias owing to 
suboptimal reporting. Specifically, most trials reported 
effect estimates for outcomes related to hypoglycaemia 
using median values and interquartile ranges, thus we 
had to impute mean and standard deviation values for 
the meta-analyses. In addition, several crossover trials 
reported results as parallel group studies,47-49 which 
also required use of imputation methods to allow 
synthesis of results. 
Furthermore, we did not register our protocol at a 
publicly available database, and submitted it only 
for internal peer review. We focused on surrogate 
outcomes and did not extract evidence for specific 
patient outcomes such as quality of life, incidence 
of ketoacidosis, or catheter occlusion. Instead, we 
adopted a practical approach focusing on outcomes 
that we expected to be most and best reported in 
trials.68 Moreover, for missing or inappropriately 
reported data, we refrained from contacting study 
authors other than those who were members of the 
review group, but used appropriate methodology to 
impute data.70
Finally, most analyses had a high degree of 
heterogeneity, which could be attributed to differences 
in continuous glucose monitoring used, sensor 
accuracy and performance, compliance with artificial 
pancreas use in supervised and unsupervised settings, 
and comparators used during control treatment if 
sensor glucose readings were or were not available. 
These differences could explain wide prediction 
intervals that included zero values for most outcomes 
in trials using artificial pancreas over 24 hours; thus, 
related findings should be interpreted with caution. 
By contrast, strong evidence indicated that overnight 
use of artificial pancreas would be beneficial for 
outcomes regarding time in near normoglycaemia, 
hyperglycaemia, or hypoglycaemia (95% prediction 
intervals excluding zero values), suggesting that this 
treatment effect can be expected in future patients.
Implications
Our study highlights some pitfalls in the conduct and 
reporting of artificial pancreas trials. Many trials had a 
short duration or were designed to assess the feasibility 
or safety, rather than long term effectiveness. Despite 
existing guidance, we noted significant variation 
in outcomes assessed and metrics used.71 Research 
groups should report a minimum set of agreed 
outcome measures and respective metrics.66-68 To 
ensure the clinical relevance and feasibility of this core 
outcome set, it is crucial that its development involves 
all key stakeholders, including patients, their families, 
clinicians, researchers, statisticians, methodologists, 
industry representatives, regulatory authorities, and 
funders. 
To maximise the yield of information and to facilitate 
analysis and synthesis of evidence overall, the use of 
a common repository for data on individual patients 
could be agreed on.72 73 Such repositories would 
facilitate free dissemination of raw trial data, allowing 
for replication of previous research findings using 
various analysis approaches (for example, a repeated 
measures analysis) of clinically relevant outcomes. 
Moreover, to enhance the external validity of evidence, 
future trials should broaden inclusion criteria and 
recruit more heterogeneous populations, including 
ethnic minorities.
The performance of current artificial pancreas 
systems could be enhanced by the optimisation of 
system components. Use of novel insulin analogues 
with faster pharmacokinetics,74 the development of

glucagon preparation stable at room temperature, 
and integration of artificial pancreas components into 
one device could further enhance user experience 
and artificial pancreas usefulness, and thus increase 
uptake. Future research should explore the potential 
differences 
between 
individual 
components 
(algorithms, continuous glucose monitoring) and 
determine their clinical relevance. 
Upcoming trials should clarify the differences 
between single hormone and dual hormone systems, 
and explore artificial pancreas use in relevant groups 
of people with type 2 diabetes such as those with 
inpatient hyperglycaemia.75 Moreover, the effect 
of artificial pancreas use on quality of life and on 
reducing patient burden should be further explored,76 
considering that patients with type 1 diabetes and their 
carers have shown a positive attitude towards artificial 
pancreas systems.77-79 Finally, to support adoption, 
cost effectiveness should be assessed to allow for 
reimbursement by various healthcare systems, and 
ensure that adequate infrastructure exists.
Conclusions
Our systematic review and meta-analysis has shown 
that artificial pancreas systems are an efficacious and 
safe treatment approach for people with type 1 diabetes, 
leading to increased time in near normoglycaemic 
range, and reduced time in hypoglycaemia and 
hyperglycaemia. The results were verified for all types 
of artificial pancreas and in all sensitivity analyses. 
Further research with rigorous studies, cooperation 
of research groups in terms of outcome reporting, and 
cost effectiveness data are required to verify these 
findings and support adoption of artificial pancreas 
systems in clinical practice.
