Computer games are ubiquitous and can be utilized for serious purposes such as health 
and education. “Applied games” including serious games (in brief, computerized games 
for serious purposes) and gamification (gaming elements used outside of games) have 
the potential to increase the impact of mental health internet interventions via three 
processes. First, by extending the reach of online programs to those who might not 
otherwise use them. Second, by improving engagement through both game-based 
and “serious” motivational dynamics. Third, by utilizing varied mechanisms for change, 
including therapeutic processes and gaming features. In this scoping review, we aim to 
advance the field by exploring the potential and opportunities available in this area. We 
review engagement factors which may be exploited and demonstrate that there is prom-
ising evidence of effectiveness for serious games for depression from contemporary 
systematic reviews. We illustrate six major categories of tested applied games for mental 
health (exergames, virtual reality, cognitive behavior therapy-based games, entertainment 
games, biofeedback, and cognitive training games) and demonstrate that it is feasible 
to translate traditional evidence-based interventions into computer gaming formats and 
to exploit features of computer games for therapeutic change. Applied games have 
considerable potential for increasing the impact of online interventions for mental health. 
However, there are few independent trials, and direct comparisons of game-based and 
non-game-based interventions are lacking. Further research, faster iterations, rapid 
testing, non-traditional collaborations, and user-centered approaches are needed to 
respond to diverse user needs and preferences in rapidly changing environments.

iNtrODUctiON
Computer games are played by millions of adolescents (1) and adults (2) around the world, with 
over 40% of the United States population playing computer games for 3 or more hours per week 
in 2015 (2). Computer games vary enormously along dimensions such goals, interaction, and 
involved technologies. They include fast mini-games, as simple as lining up dots in a row, through

to augmented reality (AR), and intricate shared worlds. Quality 
computer games have been shown to enhance concentration (3), 
improve retention of information (4), facilitate deep learning 
(5), and bring about behavior change (6). Over recent decades, 
computerized game-based approaches, both “serious games” and 
“gamification” have been developed for “serious” purposes: to 
educate, motivate, and/or persuade users, in educational, health, 
and other settings (7, 8). “Serious games” and “gamification” can 
be defined variously. However, both seek to employ games (or 
substantial game elements) in an effort to educate and change pat-
terns of experience and/or behavior. Serious games utilize gaming 
as a central and primary medium (9). In contrast, gamification 
refers to the addition of game elements to non-game contexts 
(10). A gamified intervention may not operate as a full game 
experience but contains gaming elements, such as the scoring of 
points, in-game rewards, or engaging in quests.
Game-based approaches for mental health are in their infancy. 
However, initial studies, mainly of serious games, suggest 
potential benefits for psychological and behavioral changes, or 
symptom relief (11–17). Alongside these scientific developments, 
there has been significant growth in smartphone apps for mental 
health (18–20). Some of these use gaming or gamification, but 
most have not been scientifically tested (18).
To date, the potential of serious games and gamification 
(together “applied games” or “applied gaming”) in mental 
health has been understudied. Where applied games have been 
researched, interventions are often poorly described, and diverse 
approaches are treated as homogeneous. In this perspective paper, 
we aim to advance the field by highlighting the scope of applied 
games for mental health. We consider the potential for applied 
gaming and motivational features that may be utilized. We exam-
ine evidence of effectiveness from systematic reviews and dem-
onstrate major types of tested applied games for mental health. 
Finally, we highlight promising directions for development.
tHe POteNtiAL OF APPLieD GAMes
Applied games are intriguing for mental health for three reasons:
  First, applied gaming offers “appealing potential,” as suggested 
by the popularity of computer games (21). Applied gaming 
approaches might increase the reach of mental health inter-
ventions to some who might not otherwise access help. This is 
important given the large numbers of people who experience 
mental distress and yet receive no treatment (the mental 
health treatment gap) (22).
  Second, applied gaming has “engaging potential.” Users might 
experience gaming approaches as enjoyable, want to “win” 
the game, or see how the story unfolds. Such dynamics may 
contribute to reducing high attrition rates in naturalistically 
implemented internet-based interventions (23, 24).
  Third, applied gaming has “effectiveness potential,” because 
it provides opportunities for both conventional and non-
traditional processes for behavior change and learning. For 
instance, applied gaming can offer immersive experiences 
where a state of “flow” can be achieved, provide rich sensory 
environments to support learning, allow behavioral modeling 
and social learning, allow users to try new skills in a safe yet 
reactive environment, and facilitate repeated rehearsal of new 
behavior (9, 25–27).
eNGAGeMeNt
Games exploit varied processes for engagement. Hamari and 
Tuunanen (28) carried out a meta-synthesis of 12 studies and 
identified key motivational orientations that support engagement. 
These were achievement, exploration, sociability, domination, 
and immersion (for examples, see Table 2). A further motivation 
of escape (where a user plays to escape real-life problems) has 
also been reported (29). A user may have several or all of these 
motivations for playing a game, and predominant motivations 
may vary across demographic groups, contexts, and types of game 
(28). This model could be extended to reflect the proposition that 
users of applied games might also have a further dimension along 
which their motivation varies, that of the serious purpose itself, 
in the present case, interest in improving mental health. For users 
who are motivated in this way, it may be that just a few gaming 
elements might enhance engagement or even that gaming ele-
ments are off-putting (30). For those less motivated to improve 
their mental health, stronger and more extensive gaming features 
may be critical.
eXistiNG reseArcH: A scOPiNG revieW
In order to provide an overview of evidence for applied games, we 
carried out a review of systematic reviews. Our inclusion criteria 
were systematic review of serious games and/or gamified inter-
ventions for mental health (treatment or prevention), published 
in the peer-reviewed literature from 2010 to June 2016 (reflecting 
the recent development of the field), and available in English. We 
searched PsycINFO and Medline using the terms (systematic 
review) AND (mental health OR mental illness OR depression 
OR anxiety) AND (treatment OR prevention) AND (computer 
OR internet OR digital OR online) AND (game OR gaming OR 
gamification OR play). After duplicates were removed, a total of 
18 papers were identified. A Google search and check of citations 
yielded no further papers for inclusion. Titles and abstracts 
were independently scanned by two authors (TF and LB). From 
these, three systematic reviews, two of which also included meta-
analyses, fitted the inclusion criteria (see Table 1).
Each of the included papers was focused specifically on 
depression. Two reviews (9, 32) examined serious games for 
depression, while Li et al. (31) focused specifically on a subset 
of serious games, exergames. Fleming et al. (9) identified nine 
studies of six computerized interventions that utilized gaming as 
a major or primary component to treat or prevent depression. Li 
et al. (32) identified a higher number of studies, although exactly 
how many studies of how many interventions was not clearly 
reported and the search terms and inclusion criteria were not 
specified. As shown in Table 1, both Li et al. (32) and Fleming 
et al. (9) conclude that the utilization of serious games for depres-
sion is promising, but that further research is needed. Given the 
heterogeneity of included studies and the nature of many of these 
being small trials, some not randomized or controlled, stronger

conclusions would be premature. In the more narrowly focused 
review (31), only three Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) 
were identified; however, the authors reported a significant effect 
of exergames on depressive symptoms. As noted in each review, 
there was a lack of direct comparison of game-based to non-
gaming interventions, and most studies were not independent of 
the developers. The research is at an early stage.
tYPes OF APPLieD GAMes
The three systematic reviews included six main types of applied 
games. Each of these categories is outlined below. An example 
of each, and potential mechanisms for therapeutic change and 
engagement, is given in Table 2.
exergames
Exergames are sport or movement-based games. Nine of the 
included studies (across the three reviews) tested the use of 
exergames for depressive symptoms, primarily among older 
adults (31). Eight studies used “repurposed games,” games 
developed for entertainment or commercial purposes and now 
tested for mental health. One was purpose-built. Li et al. (31) 
reported a significant effect of exergames on depressive symp-
toms, with this being higher among more playful games, over 
those that included less game elements. However, these results 
should be interpreted with caution, given that only three of the 
studies were RCTs, and the sample sizes were small.
virtual reality Games
Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) can offer 
immersive interactivity in a virtual or augmented world, with 
visual, audio, and sometimes other sensory stimuli, to increase 
user engagement and possibly therapeutic impact (38, 39). Li 
et al. (32) identified six studies of VR gaming interventions. 
They reported that these had positive results. However, only 2 
had over 10 participants, and most of the original papers provide

little detail regarding the game. Hence an alternative example, 
that of Virtual Iraq for PTSD (34) is given in Table 2. Promising 
findings from VR interventions, including non-game-based VR 
interventions (40) along with the popularity of commercial AR 
games, suggest promise in this area.

approximately one level per week on a personal computer. 
Each of these programs was aimed at children or young peo-
ple. Each reported positive or promising results, except for 
ReachOutCentral, which had mixed findings and has since been 
retired. Of these, SPARX is described in the greatest depth and 
is outlined in Table 2.
A further example, SuperBetter, has been tested since the 
publication of the systematic reviews; however, it is included here 
(Table 2), as it illustrates new opportunities for applied games. 
SuperBetter is a positive psychology program in which players 
earn points and “level-up,” as they progress through activities. 
Rather than being a narrative-based serious game, SuperBetter 
offers a more gamified approach, with scoring and rewards. In 
another point of difference, SuperBetter allows “snacktivity,” 
frequent, brief activities that can be done a few minutes at a time, 
every day or more often (therefore like “snacking” behavior). This 
pattern of use is common in contemporary online apps but is not 
common in tested online mental health tools to date, many of 
which follow traditional clinical therapeutic models (e.g., weekly 
sessions of 30 minutes or more). In a recent RCT, participants 
who were asked to play SuperBetter for 10 minutes daily over 
30 days experienced significantly greater reductions in depres-
sive symptoms and anxiety compared to a waitlist control group; 
however, attrition was high (35).
entertainment computer Games
This category of interventions is quite different from those that 
translate an evidence-based mental health therapy (such as 
CBT or exposure therapy) into a game format. In this grouping, 
entertainment video games were tested for effects on mood. 
Several studies of this nature were included in Li et al. (32). In 
the first of these, students were given a “frustrating task” and 
then 45 minutes of violent video game play or a control condi-
tion. Those playing the violent game reported lower symptoms of 
depression immediately following the intervention in one study 
(41). However, in a second study, no effect for depression was 
reported (42). In a further study, Rossoniello et al. (43) reported 
subjects had improved mood immediately following playing a 
casual video game Bejeweled II. These entertainment games were 
proposed to affect mood via emotional regulation, stress release, 
or social support pathways.
A different form of using commercial games for mental 
health is the use of the puzzle game Tetris for therapeutic 
purposes. In Tetris, players strategically move, rotate, and drop 
“Tertriminos” to complete horizontal lines. Engaging in this 
visuospatial cognitive activity when memories are activated is 
proposed to help impede traumatic flashbacks in PTSD by inter-
fering with memory consolidation (37). Preliminary findings 
have also shown promise for using Tetris to reduce cravings (44).
Biofeedback-Based Games
The included reviews described two biofeedback-based games: 
the Journey to the Wild Divine and Freeze-Framer 2.0. In 
each of these, users rehearse relaxation skills while receiving 
visual feedback on physiological indicators (measured using 
a sensor attached to the ear lobe or the fingertips). In a small 
trial, youth receiving the intervention had significantly lower 
post-intervention levels of depression and anxiety compared to 
those in a waitlist control group (36).
cognitive training Games
The reviews included one study using cognitive training games. 
Alvarez et al. (45) tested number and letter sequence training 
games to reduce cognitive impairment in 31 depressed students. 
In this study, the game had positive results on cognitive impair-
ment, but direct effects on mood were not tested.
FUtUre DirectiONs
It is demonstrably feasible to translate traditional evidence-based 
interventions, such as CBT and exposure therapies, to computer 
gaming formats. Included interventions have shown that it is also 
possible to exploit features of computer games for therapeutic 
change using mechanisms that are not traditionally salient in 
 
psychological therapies, such as in the example of Tetris for 
 
PTSD. Further, the potential for positive mental health outcomes 
from casual play of entertainment games is worthy of explora-
tion, as this might offer opportunities to reach large numbers 
of people. Each of these approaches appears to be promising. 
However, this evidence is at an early stage, and independent, 
larger robust studies are needed. Further, there is a lack of data 
regarding whether gaming-based approaches might be more 
appealing than non-gaming mental health interventions for 
users with different motivations, including both those who do 
and those who do not want to access help for distress. This is a 
question for future research. Similarly, findings from trials and 
user reviews of some commercially available programs suggest 
that applied gaming approaches can be engaging; however, many 
analyses do not report engagement or ongoing use. The assertion 
that quality gaming dynamics will increase engagement, at least 
for some users, should also be tested in future research.
We have highlighted that applied gaming interventions 
vary widely, in terms of types of games and in terms of features 
that might be appealing and motivating. It would be valuable 
to explore popular engaging game types for target groups and 
compare features in those games with those used in games for 
mental health. For example, highly accessed games currently 
include smart phone-based mini-games, massive multiplayer 
games where millions of players interact, games that allow user-
generated content, and games that are linked to popular social 
media platforms (2, 46, 47). These approaches did not feature 
strongly in the included interventions.
Despite the potential for applied gaming, there are challenges 
in proposing such approaches, including costs, speed of imple-
mentation, issues of face validity, and user preferences. Many 
gamers will be familiar with commercially produced games, 
which often involve development budgets in the tens of mil-
lions of dollars (48, 49). Even simple mini-games undergo rapid 
advances, with new versions regularly released. Funding limita-
tions make it challenging to develop and maintain comparable 
scientific initiatives.
Speed of implementation is also critical (49). Traditional 
scientific methods of sequential development, piloting, refine-
ment, testing in a RCT, followed by publication, and independent

Fleming et al.
Applied Games for Mental Health
replication, prior to real-world implementation, will ensure that 
evidence-based applied gaming lags behind the rapidly shifting 
commercial hardware and software environments. Newer meth-
odological approaches are available (24).
Rather different challenges include those of face validity and 
diverse user motivations. People often do not seek help for mental 
health issues until these are relatively serious (22), in which case 
a game may be perceived as trivializing or inappropriate (Fleming 
et al., manuscript in preparation). Conversely, those who do 
not want therapeutic help might be irked that their game has a 
mental health agenda as suggested by the gamergate phenomena 
(50). These factors should be investigated in future research. The 
diversity of gaming approaches and user motivations also pose 
challenges. Not all games are successful. Quality game develop-
ment requires specialist skills, and meeting user preferences may 
necessitate the creation of a range of interventions.
We have previously proposed four key ways of maximizing 
the impact of E-therapies and serious games in mental health. 
Utilizing this framework, as identified by the Collaboration 
on Maximizing the impact of E-therapy and Serious Gaming 
(COMETS) (24), we believe that to achieve significant mental 
health benefits, the field requires:
 – User-centered approaches. This necessitates exploring the 
motivations and preferences of user groups for addressing 
their mental health needs. The field of game development has 
illustrated that this is unlikely to be through one approach or 
single engagement factor for all users.
 – Engaging, as well as effective interventions. Even very effective 
interventions will have limited population impact if they are 
not engaging. Studies should explore and report engagement 
as well as effectiveness and provide sufficient detail regarding 
dynamics used, to allow others to build on their work.
 – Intersectorial and international collaborations. The skills 
required to develop engaging and effective games with high 
uptake are diverse and go beyond many science or clinically 
focused teams. Further, the costs of developing interventions 
may be more easily borne across sectors and jurisdictions.
 – Rapid testing and implementation. User expectations in 
technology-driven approaches and gaming evolve rapidly. 
Innovative, rapid research designs and planning for imple-
mentation are needed to ensure that interventions are still 
appealing when they are ready for implementation.
cONcLUsiON
In this perspective paper, we have  illustrated the potential of 
serious games and gamification for mental health and high-
lighted that there is serious work still to be done. The field is 
ready for further development, as the feasibility and range of 
possible approaches has been shown, and as there is an urgent 
need for engaging, appealing effective mental health interven-
tions which reach large numbers of people. Future research 
should include independent trials and direct comparisons 
of game-based and non-game-based options for varied user 
groups.
