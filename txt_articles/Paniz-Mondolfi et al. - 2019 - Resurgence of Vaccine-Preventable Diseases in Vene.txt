 Venezuela’s tumbling economy and authoritarian rule have 
precipitated an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. Hyperin-
flation rates now exceed 45,000%, and Venezuela’s health 
system is in free fall. The country is experiencing a mas-
sive exodus of biomedical scientists and qualified health-
care professionals. Reemergence of arthropod-borne and 
vaccine-preventable diseases has sparked serious epidem-
ics that also affect neighboring countries. In this article, we 
discuss the ongoing epidemics of measles and diphtheria in 
Venezuela and their disproportionate impact on indigenous 
populations. We also discuss the potential for reemergence 
of poliomyelitis and conclude that action to halt the spread 
of vaccine-preventable diseases within Venezuela is a mat-
ter of urgency for the country and the region. We further 
provide specific recommendations for addressing this crisis.
R
esidents of Venezuela are struggling to survive in a 
country with the world’s highest annual inflation rate, 
46,305% (1), and a minimum monthly wage of just USD 
$1.79 (5,196,000 Bolivars). The International Monetary 
Fund predicted an inflation rate of 1,000,000% by the end 
of 2018 (1). Sixty-six percent of the population lives in ex-
treme poverty (2), amid escalating violence and a crum-
bling healthcare infrastructure more typical of conflict 
zones or war-torn nations. More than 280,000 children are 
at risk for death from severe malnutrition (3). According 
to the last official nationwide epidemiologic bulletin, pub-
lished in 2016, infant and maternal mortality had risen by 
30% and 65%, respectively, over the previous year (2); no 
further national epidemiologic records have been released.
Long-term shortages of essential medicines and medi-
cal supplies (only 30% of basic drugs to treat infectious dis-
eases are available in public hospitals) (2), interruption of 
epidemiologic surveillance systems, weakening of immu-
nization programs, and an unprecedented exodus of trained 
medical personnel have set the stage for the resurgence of 
vectorborne and vaccine-preventable infections (4–6). A 
striking manifestation is the ongoing malaria epidemic in 
Venezuela (6–9), now approaching half a million cases per

year and continuing to increase at rates exceeding those 
previously reported anywhere in the world (10).
Recently, the return of measles and other vaccine-
preventable childhood infections in Venezuela (Figure 1), 
as well as the potential for expansion of outbreaks beyond 
Venezuela’s borders, has been recognized by the World 
Health Organization (WHO) and the Pan American Health 
Organization (PAHO) (9). In Colombia alone, 25 cases of 
imported measles in migrants from Venezuela had been re-
corded as of October 2018 (9,10). The continued mass exo-
dus of ≈2 million persons from Venezuela since 2014 (9), 
not only to Colombia (>820,000 migrants) but also to Ec-
uador (>450,000) and Brazil (>57,000) (11–13), represents 
an ongoing risk that vaccine-preventable diseases will be 
carried with them. The United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees (UNHCR) has launched a supplementary ap-
peal for funding for these affected countries (14). Simulta-
neously, the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases must 
be tackled urgently within Venezuela, with an emphasis on 
containing outbreaks locally and at critical border areas.
Measles
In Venezuela, circulation of wild measles was interrupted 
in February 2007 after a mass vaccination campaign that 
 
followed outbreaks in 2001 and 2006 (15). However, since 
2017, measles has reemerged in Venezuela, particularly 
within 
vulnerable 
indigenous 
populations, 
and 
has 
subsequently reached neighboring countries (Figure 1, panel 
A) (16). As of October 23, 2018, Venezuela had contributed 
68% (5,525/8,091 cases) of the measles cases reported in the 
Americas and most of the measles-related deaths (73/85) (16). 
Genotyping of the measles virus isolated from patients from 
Venezuela (imported cases) in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, 
and Peru confirmed that the strains were genotype D8, lineage 
MVi/Hulu Langat.MYS/26.11 (16). The D8 genotype is 
associated with endemic transmission in Asia and the Pacific 
(17) and is the main lineage circulating currently in South 
America (16).
Measles now affects multiple states in Venezuela, and a 
disproportionate number of cases occur among indigenous 
populations located in the vast forestlands of the southern 
region. Measles cases were first reported in epidemiolog-
ic week 26 of 2017 in the southern, mineral-rich state of 
Bolívar; 82% of the cases were detected in the municipality 
of Caroní (18). From week 26 of 2017 through week 43 
of 2018, a total of 7,524 suspected cases were reported, of 
which 6,252 have been confirmed (727 in 2017 and 5,525 
in 2018); 75 deaths were attributed to measles, most of

them in the Amazon and Orinoco River Delta regions of 
the country. The affected regions have widened to include 
other more populated states such as Apure, Anzoátegui, 
Delta Amacuro, the Capital District, Miranda, Monagas, 
Vargas, and Zulia (Figure 2, panel A) (16).
The circulation of measles in Venezuela was preceded 
by the progressive interruption of the national immunization 
program since the year 2010, along with the dismantling of 
the primary healthcare infrastructure. The national coverage 
rate for the second dose of the measles vaccine was estimated 
at 52% according to the last reports from the Venezuela Min-
istry of Health (19,20). This estimate ranks Venezuela to-
ward the bottom of vaccination coverage in the region (20). 
Current estimates indicate that measles vaccination coverage 
in the Venezuelan Amazon region has decreased in all mu-
nicipalities (Alto Orinoco, 40%; Atabapo 18, 6%; Atures 66, 
6%; Autana 35, 5%; Manapiare 30, 5%; Maroa 5, 2%; and 
Rio Negro 41, 7%) (21), notably affecting the Venezuela–
Brazil border, where the current measles outbreak threatens 
to decimate the ancestral aboriginal Yanomami people.
The massive job losses that followed the economic cri-
sis and the dismantling of private industry has meant that 
most persons in Venezuela have been forced to rely on in-
formal jobs, such as illegal mining. Illegal mining camps, 
which attract migrant workers from communities through-
out Venezuela and from neighboring countries and aborigi-
nal settlements, provide a setting for measles transmission 
within the camps themselves and for its further spread once 
the mine workers return to their home communities. Cross-
border mobility, migration, and illegal mining activities 
(21), in which native and indigenous persons are increas-
ingly involved, have been proposed as the probable source 
of the proliferation of measles in remote areas inhabited 
by unvaccinated persons (21). Examples of vulnerable ab-
original settlements include those located at the Imataca 
Forest Reserve; the Paragua, Caura, and Caroní Rivers; 
Cerro Guanay Natural Monument; and most important, the 
Canaima and Cerro Yapakana National Parks (22). Recent 
reports from the nongovernmental organizations Survival 
International and Wataniba indicate that ≈100 cases of 
measles have occurred among members of the isolated and 
vulnerable Yanomami populations in the Venezuela–Bra-
zil border region (23). Deaths attributed to measles have 
already occurred, according to Horonami (a Yanomami 
nongovernment organization), and high morbidity and 
mortality rates are expected because these populations are 
immunologically naive (24,25). Measles is presumed to 
have entered the Yanomami communities from Brazil after 
imported cases from Venezuela brought the disease to bor-
der populations of Brazil, before spreading back to Yano-
mami communities in Venezuela (11,25). Further spread of 
this epidemic wave could devastate the Yanomami people 
living in the Orinoco highlands of the Amazon, given that 
humanitarian aid to affected sites is limited or hard to de-
liver because of the seminomadic characteristics of these 
indigenous populations and the remoteness of the Yano-
mami territory.
Other indigenous populations in Venezuela who are 
particularly vulnerable to the extension of the measles out-
break include the Warao, located in the Orinoco River Delta. 
During 2018, ≈100 measles-related deaths occurred among 
indigenous infants and children in the municipality of Tucu-
pita in the Orinoco River Delta (24). Reports from the mu-
nicipalities of Pedernales and Antonio Diaz in the same area 
indicate that the death toll has increased, with 102 additional 
cases to date (24). Cases have spread rapidly from this region 
to the neighboring municipality of Barrancas del Orinoco 
(Venezuela) (25) and to the border state of Roraima (Brazil).
Again, emigration from Venezuela has substantially 
affected neighboring Brazil and Colombia, as well as other 
countries in the region, such as Ecuador (26). Measles cases 
imported from Venezuela have been reported in all 3 nations

 PERSPECTIVE
(Figure 1, panels A, B) Thus far, Brazil has reported most of 
the imported measles cases, mainly from the state of Boli-
var in Venezuela), where a major measles outbreak is taking 
place (27). Not surprisingly, Brazil has the region’s second 
highest measles burden, with 2,801 confirmed cases reported 
through epidemiologic week 44 of 2018 (Appendix, https://
wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/25/4/18-1305-App1.pdf) in the 
neighboring states of Roraima (345 cases) and Amazonas 
(2,357 confirmed cases and 7,425 suspected cases) (Figure 
2, panel A) (10,24). The link to the Venezuela outbreak was 
established by the isolation and identification of genotype 
D8 in the first cases of the outbreak in Brazil in February 
2018, as confirmed by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation and un-
equivocally recognized by PAHO (18,24). In Brazil, the lo-
cations principally affected are Boa Vista, Paracaima, Cantá, 
Rorainopolis, Uramuta, and Manaus (24). These states have 
received a massive influx of migrants from Venezuela (24). 
Isolated and import-related cases were also identified in the 
states of São Paulo (3 cases), Rio Grande do Sul (43 cases), 
Pará (23 cases), Pernambuco (4 cases), and Rondônia (2 
cases), as well as in Rio de Janeiro (19 cases), Sergipe (4 
cases), and Distrito Federal (1 case) (24). In addition, the 
Brazilian Ministry of Health has reported 14 measles deaths 
through the end of October 2018 in the states of Roraima (4 
cases), Amazonas (8 cases), and Pará (2 cases) (24). Of all 
cases reported by Brazil’s Ministry of Health in the state of 
Roraima through May 2018, a total of 68% corresponded to 
refugees from Venezuela, and 52.7% were in Warao Am-
erindians (24). Although Brazil has a free vaccination pro-
gram with high coverage levels, a recent decrease in polio 
and measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination rates, linked 
to local antivaccine movements (28,29) and government un-
derfunding of the healthcare system (30), are worrisome and 
might worsen the current measles outbreak (28,29).
The Colombia Ministry of Health has also reported 
25 measles cases imported from Venezuela (Figure 2, 
panel A) (16), again confirmed by isolation and molecular 
identification of genotype D8 in the initial cases (18,31). 
Most cases were reported from bordering states that re-
ceived a considerable migratory influx in 2018 and that 
also had received the most numerous groups comprising 
the 600,000 immigrants from Venezuela in 2017 (26). 
Moreover, many residents of Venezuela transit through 
Colombia to Ecuador, where, by epidemiologic week 44 
of 2018, a total of 13 of the 600 suspected cases imported 
from Venezuela had been confirmed as measles by the Ec-
uador Ministry of Health (Figure 2, panel A) (8,10). The 
index case-patient proceeded from Venezuela through 
the border with Colombia, where ≈286,000 persons have 
crossed through the Rumichaca international bridge. As 
of epidemiologic week 42 of 2018, the Peru Ministry of 
Health had also reported 2 cases imported from Venezu-
ela (Figure 2, panel A) (16).
The reestablishment of measles transmission because 
of continuous circulation of either indigenous or imported 
measles virus for >12 months (32) has threatened the 
Americas with losing its certification as a measles-free 
region. On August 24, 2018, PAHO recognized the 
reestablishment of endemic transmission of measles in 
Venezuela, thereby suggesting that the Americas was 
unlikely to remain a certified measles-free region (33,34).
Diphtheria
Diphtheria, a childhood vaccine-preventable disease, 
had not been reported in Venezuela during the 24 years 
before 2016. However, during July–November 2016, a 
total of 183 suspected diphtheria cases were reported by 
16 of the 24 federal entities in Venezuela (Figure 2, panel 
B) (34), alerting PAHO and WHO to the reappearance of 
this disease (35). Since 2016, a total of 2,170 cases have 
been reported to date (324 in 2016, 1,040 in 2017, and 806 
cases in 2018 [through October 29]). Of the 2,170 cases, 
1,249 were laboratory confirmed; 287 deaths were reported 
(17 in 2016, 103 in 2017, and 167 in 2018), yielding a 
case-fatality rate of 22% (34). For 2018, a total of 838 
diphtheria cases have been reported in the Americas as of 
epidemiologic week 41 of 2018 (34). The other 3 countries 
are Haiti (80 cases), Brazil (6 cases) (36), and Colombia (8 
cases). However, 3 of 8 cases in Colombia were imported 
cases from Venezuela (34).
As in the case of measles, low local vaccination 
coverage rates have left Venezuela susceptible to the 
resurgence of diphtheria. By 2016, national coverage 
with 3 doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) 
vaccine (DTP3) was ≈84%, and reported coverage with 4 
doses of DTP barely reached 60% (37). PAHO estimated 
coverage rates in 2017 of 66% for DTP3 and 38% for 
4 doses of DTP (38). Recent unofficial data suggest 
that for 2018, national DTP3 coverage might not even 
reach 50% (39), resulting in an important increase in 
the number of susceptible persons, of whom ≈3 million 
are children. Achieving adequate vaccination rates is 
even more difficult in remote areas, where geographic 
isolation and ongoing conflicts between armed gangs, 
guerrilla forces, and military personnel hamper adequate 
access to rural communities. The southern areas of the 
Amazon basin, such as Bolívar state, Amazonas state, and 
the Orinoco River Delta, are particularly at risk because 
of low pentavalent DTP–Haemophilus influenzae type 
b–hepatitis B vaccination coverage; reported coverage 
rates are 50% for Bolívar, 37% for Amazonas, and 24% 
for the Orinoco River Delta, according to data from the 
Venezuela Ministry of Health (37,40).
Although the first cases of diphtheria in Venezuela were 
reported in the southern state of Bolivar and were attribut-
ed initially to crowding and unhealthy conditions in illegal 
 
628

 Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, Venezuela
mining camps, the disease has spread rapidly throughout the 
country, reaching epidemic proportions (39). Current data 
indicate that the number of reported cases likely underesti-
mates the actual magnitude of the outbreak. Reports on the 
occurrence of diphtheria in isolated Amerindian communi-
ties, such as the Pemón and Kariña aboriginal populations, 
illustrate the geographic reach of the disease.
Diphtheria has now spread to Brazil and Colombia 
(Figure 2, panel B). In February 2018, PAHO–WHO is-
sued an update on diphtheria in the Americas, highlighting 
the occurrence of exported cases from Venezuela to Brazil 
and Colombia (41). In Brazil, a fatal case imported from 
Venezuela was recorded in the state of Roraima, and in Co-
lombia, another fatal case was reported in the Department 
of La Guajira (Figure 2, panel B). These cases highlight the 
vulnerability of the bordering states to the outbreak (41). 
The lack of infrastructure to receive massive numbers of 
forced migrants and the associated problems with poor 
access to essential health and sanitation services are po-
tential facilitators for disease emergence and transmission 
(41). During epidemiologic week 8 of 2018, PAHO urged 
health authorities to intensify epidemiologic surveillance, 
case detection, medical care, and vaccination (39). Since 
that week, PAHO has confirmed diphtheria cases in Brazil, 
Colombia, and Venezuela (Figure 2, panel B) (41).
Polio
In 1971, poliomyelitis became the second vaccine-pre-
ventable disease (after smallpox) to be eliminated from the 
Americas, later followed by measles and rubella (42,43). 
Venezuela’s devastated healthcare infrastructure has halt-
ed many of its immunization programs. Estimates indicate 
that vaccination coverage against polio has dropped below 
minimum recommended levels (80%); coverage with the 
third dose of polio vaccine slipped from 87% in 2015 to 
<79% in 2017 (7), thus establishing the conditions for the 
potential emergence of vaccine-derived polioviruses (VD-
PVs). Historically, low vaccination coverage in conflict-
affected countries has played an important role in the re-
emergence of poliomyelitis because of circulating VDPVs 
(cVDPVs). Examples include Laos, where an outbreak 
attributable to cVDPV type 1 cases occurred during 2015–
2016; Nigeria and Pakistan, which reported cVDPV type 2 
cases throughout 2016; Syria and the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo, where cVDVP type 2 was present during 
2017–2018; and Mogadishu, Somalia (2017) and Kenya 
(2018), where cVDPV type 2 was isolated from environ-
mental samples (44).
The current reality in Venezuela is a conflux of 
plummeting vaccination coverages and ongoing outbreaks 
of other vaccine-preventable diseases. Combined with the 
weakening of surveillance programs, forced migrations, 
and a prolonged political, economic, and food crisis without 
 
foreseeable resolution, these factors have set the stage for 
potential reemergence of poliomyelitis.
Addressing the Vaccine-Preventable Disease  
Crisis in Venezuela
During the past decade, crises in Africa and the Middle 
East have provided numerous examples of the consequenc-
es for failure of the control of vaccine-preventable diseases 
when healthcare delivery is disrupted by political turmoil; 
these areas have also provided paradigms of successful in-
tervention measures. In Syria, the destruction of healthcare 
and sanitation infrastructure resulted in the reappearance 
of polio 15 years after its eradication from that country. 
At the same time, the number of measles cases expanded 
to >7,000 confirmed cases nationwide and extended into 
neighboring countries with higher vaccination coverage 
(45). Similarly, disruption of immunization programs dur-
ing the recent political unrest in Yemen led to a measles 
outbreak with >4,300 cases and a high death rate (46); the 
number of cases totaled 7,285, according to the most re-
cent data from WHO (47). In both Syria and Yemen, the 
acknowledgment by WHO of the severity of the crises and 
assistance marshaling the resources required to mount mas-
sive immunization campaigns enabled substantial progress 
toward containment, although the inability to consistently 
sustain immunization activities has precluded ideal disease 
control and the prevention of potential new outbreaks. Sub-
sequently, WHO codified and published an evidence-based 
approach for vaccination in humanitarian crises that incor-
porates a framework for decision-making (48). The ongo-
ing diphtheria and measles epidemics in Venezuela and 
spillover into neighboring countries evoke the reemergence 
of vaccine-preventable diseases observed in Syria and Ye-
men and the consequent threat to regional, and potentially 
global, public health.
The Americas region has been free of wild poliovirus 
circulation for nearly 3 decades, mainly because of suc-
cessful immunization programs and vaccination campaigns 
in high-risk regions. Without doubt, these efforts halted the 
final chains of transmission and provided strong herd im-
munity. Similarly, in 2007, Venezuela was able to success-
fully implement a mass vaccination program that arrested 
the circulation of measles and ended the 2006 outbreak. 
Today, however, the crisis in Venezuela has enabled vac-
cine-preventable diseases such as diphtheria and measles 
to reemerge (34). The weakening of Venezuela’s public 
health services has led to a breakdown of epidemiologic 
surveillance systems along with an interruption of the na-
tional immunization program, resulting in the decay of in-
fection control practices. In addition, the ongoing massive 
internal and external exodus of Venezuela residents has 
become the amplifying factor of these outbreaks beyond 
Venezuela’s borders (8,24,26,29,49).

 PERSPECTIVE
The Executive Committee of PAHO, at its 162nd 
session held on June 20, 2018, presented the following 
document as a point on its agenda: “PAHO Response to 
Maintain an Effective Agenda for Technical Cooperation in 
Venezuela and in Neighboring Member States” (49). The 
document contributes, albeit somewhat late, to addressing 
the lack of information and to correct misinformation, as 
well as to refute the government of Venezuela’s official 
denial of the serious problems afflicting the country. Like-
wise, the document recognizes the lack of official informa-
tion but fails to indicate as a priority the resumption of the 
publication of the Venezuelan Ministry of Health’s Weekly 
Epidemiologic Bulletins and relevant technical documents 
from the Venezuela Ministry of Health. We believe that re-
porting health statistics is an unavoidable obligation of the 
state to its inhabitants and cannot be substituted by regional 
and international bulletins or alerts from other countries.
Recommendations
According to the evaluation approach recommended by 
WHO, the risk level of the ongoing outbreaks in Venezu-
ela is high. A correspondingly strong response is needed 
to curtail the expanse of these epidemics. We propose the 
following measures.
•  
Global and hemispheric health authorities should urge 
the Venezuela government to allow the establishment 
of a humanitarian channel to provide immediate relief 
efforts addressing extreme food and medicine shortages.
•  
Epidemiologic surveillance programs, early reporting, 
and rapid response systems should be restored imme-
diately. Strengthening of infection control practices in 
healthcare facilities should be implemented with the 
aid of international agencies while ensuring public 
health neutrality.
•  
Emergency relief operations should be put into effect 
across borders along with authorities in Colombia and 
Brazil to ameliorate the effects of massive migration 
by implementation of early nutritional and immuniza-
tion interventions.
•  
International agencies should support regional efforts 
in neighboring countries to promote simultaneous 
massive vaccination campaigns and vaccination of all 
refugees from Venezuela arriving in host community 
populations.
•  
Adequate supplies for mass vaccination and routine 
immunization should be ensured, and additional ad-
junct supplies (e.g., diphtheria antitoxin) should be 
stockpiled to assist in the establishment of standard 
treatment protocols and epidemic rapid response 
measures. These methods are crucial for healthcare 
delivery and mass vaccination catch-up campaigns to 
head off the resurgence of vaccine-preventable dis-
eases in Venezuela.
•  
In areas with low vaccination coverage, improving 
surveillance for early case detection and increasing 
vaccination coverage in high-risk age groups should 
be mandatory. Furthermore, Venezuela is in urgent 
need to reconstruct its devastated healthcare system, 
secure sustainable food and medication access, and 
reinstall proper sanitation policies to reduce the bur-
den of diseases.
On September 27, 2018, the United Nations Human 
Rights Council adopted a resolution on Venezuela 
signaling the gravity of the human rights situation and the 
growing concern by governments worldwide about the 
country’s humanitarian crisis, including aspects such as 
malnutrition and the upsurge of preventable diseases (50). 
PAHO–WHO faces an enormous challenge in attending, 
without interference, to the complex emergency that 
affects Venezuela. Emergency funds must be released to 
acquire medicines, vaccines, laboratory reagents, and 
other supplies for health programs. As Venezuela rapidly 
becomes a regional nidus for the emergence of vaccine-
preventable diseases, it must take decisive action now 
alongside regional and national partners to target this 
emerging regional crisis.

EID Podcast:  
The Past Is Never Dead— 
Measles Epidemic, Boston, 
Massachusetts, 1713
When we consider modern measles prevention, it is 
worth recalling what epidemics were like before vac-
cines and organized public health systems. One vivid ac-
count of measles describes the disease’s deadly spread 
through a prominent Boston household more than 300 
years ago. In 1713, America’s first important medical 
figure, Puritan minister Cotton Mather (1663–1728), 
called by one authority “the Dr. Spock of the colonial 
New England,” wrote about a measles epidemic in the 
American colonies, describing not only its epidemiology 
and devastation but also the fear it elicited. Mather’s ac-
count reminds us of the need for such modern medical 
and public health tools as vaccination, patient isolation, 
and prevention policies in saving families from the once-
unpreventable diseases that compelled us to develop 
effective medical advances in the first place.
