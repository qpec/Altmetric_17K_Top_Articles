IMPORTANCE Antenatal and postnatal depression are known to be common and associated
with poor outcomes for women and their children. There is little evidence on depression
symptoms among men during the perinatal period.
OBJECTIVE To identify characteristics associated with depression symptoms among men
whose partners were pregnant and subsequently gave birth.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A longitudinal cohort study provided data from a
demographically diverse sample of 3523 New Zealand men who completed interviews during
their partner’
s pregnancy and 9 months after the birth of their child. Participants were drawn
from a cohort whose partners were pregnant women with a due date between April 25,
2009, and March 25, 2010, who were enrolled in the Growing Up in New Zealand study. Data
analysis was conducted from September 1, 2015, to January 8, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Depression symptoms were measured using the Edinburgh
Postnatal Depression Scale and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire; elevated depression
symptoms were defined as scores higher than 12 and 9, respectively.
RESULTS The mean (SD) age of the participants at the antenatal interview was 33.20 (6.25)
years (range, 16-63 years). Elevated antenatal paternal depression symptoms affected 82
fathers (2.3%) and were associated with perceived stress (odds ratio [OR], 1.38; 95% CI,
1.30-1.47) and fair to poor health during their partner’
s pregnancy (OR, 2.06; 95% CI,
1.18-3.61). Elevated postnatal paternal depression symptoms affected 153 (4.3%) of fathers
and were associated with perceived stress in pregnancy (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.08-1.17), no
longer being in a relationship with the mother 9 months after childbirth (OR, 6.36; 95% CI,
2.28-17.78), having fair to poor health at 9 months (OR, 3.29; 95% CI, 2.10-5.16), being
unemployed at 9 months (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.11-3.10), and a history of depression (OR, 2.84;
95% CI, 1.69-4.78).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Expectant fathers were at risk of depression symptoms if they
felt stressed or were in poor health. Rates of elevated depression symptoms were higher
during the postpartum period and were associated with adverse social and relationship
factors. Identifying fathers most at risk of depressive symptoms and when best to target
interventions (antenatal or postnatal) may be beneficial to men and their families.

early 9% of men report a lifetime presence of depres-
sion and 2.6% report a depressive episode within the
past year.1 Pregnancy and childbirth may be high-
risk periods for male depression.2,3 Yet, interest in perinatal
depression has focused on women despite policies to im-
prove the sex balance in research.4 Studying mothers and fa-
thers should be a guiding principle in developmental re-
search. Therefore, we follow-up our group’
s maternal perinatal
depressionstudies5,6withthisarticleonpaternalantenataland
postnatal depression symptoms.
Maternal perinatal depression is linked to physiological
changes (eg, hormone fluctuations).7 Expectant and new
fathers also experience biological and ecological stressors,
including changes to brain circuits, structure, and hor-
mones,8-11 that can increase their risk of depression
symptoms.12,13 Thus, some of the biological mechanisms
underlying perinatal depression may increase the risk in
both parents.
Paternal depression is associated negative child out-
comes, including emotional and behavioral problems.14
Although paternal depression does not expose fetuses and
infants to the same intrauterine/physiological risks as
maternal depression, paternal genetic and psychosocial fac-
tors may act directly on the child and indirectly through
their effect on maternal well-being.5,15
Reported depression rates among men during their part-
ner’
s pregnancy vary from 2% to 19%,16-18 compared with 12%
to 19% for women.19 As with mothers, there is debate about
whether paternal antenatal depression symptoms (ADS) re-
flect ongoing prenatal depression rather than onset during
pregnancy. Risks for maternal ADS include unplanned preg-
nancy, domestic violence, lack of social or relationship sup-
port, and past mental illness.6,19,20 There is less evidence on
paternal ADS, but risks include anxiety, daily “hassles,”12 and
havingadepressedpartner.21Differentfactorsarelikelytocon-
tribute to the risk of depression in each of the perinatal
periods.22-24
An estimated 3% to 12% of men experience postnatal de-
pression symptoms (PDS) compared with 13% to 18% of
women.13,25,26 The extent to which PDS are a continuation of
ADS or prenatal depression remains unclear owing to a lack of
longitudinal studies.19 Risks for maternal PDS include domes-
tic violence, low socioeconomic status, physical illness, neu-
roticism,increasedparity,multiplebirths,andADS.6,19,20Many
of these factors stem from prepregnancy or pregnancy
circumstances.27,28 Paternal PDS risks include low income, un-
employment, renting, maternal depression, and marital
conflict.26 Lack of social support and cohesion is also strongly
associated with maternal29-31 and paternal32,33 perinatal de-
pression. Increasing social support is therefore a key area for
intervention.34
Evidence suggests that depression in either parent in-
creases the likelihood of the partner developing perinatal de-
pressionsymptoms.12,16,21,32,35-37However,theinfluenceofpa-
ternal depression on women seems to be greater than vice
versa.12,38 Unlike women, there is not a strong link between
past mental health problems and paternal perinatal
depression.38 More prospective longitudinal studies that in-
clude partnered men and women and span both perinatal pe-
riods are needed to confirm these findings.15,16
The present study investigated ADS and PDS among ex-
pectant and new fathers. The association between maternal
and paternal depression symptoms was explored.
Methods
Participants and General Procedure
Participants were drawn from a cohort whose partners were
pregnant women, living in 3 contiguous District Health Board
regions in New Zealand who had a due date between April 25,
2009, and March 25, 2010, who were enrolled in the Growing
Up in New Zealand study.39 Of the 6167 women who were in-
terviewed during pregnancy for the study, 5834 women
(94.6%)hadapartnerand4402partners(75.5%)agreedtotake
part.40 Prospective parents in the study were evenly distrib-
uted among socioeconomic groups, and most participants
(97.5%) were married or cohabiting with a study mother. The
New Zealand Ministry of Health Northern Y Regional Ethics
Committee approved the study and written informed con-
sent was obtained. Participants who completed the antenatal
interview received a gift bag.
A face-to-face, computer-assisted interview was com-
pleted at 3827 participants’homes during the third trimester
of their partner’
s pregnancy (ie, an interviewer used a com-
puter to administer a personalized questionnaire). Of the 4402
partners who agreed to take part in the study, 1 gave no ADS
data and 575 participants completed the interview retrospec-
tively after childbirth; hence, these individuals were ex-
cluded, leaving a sample of 3826.
A second interview (n = 3549) was conducted approxi-
mately 9 months after childbirth. Thus, 277 participants (7.8%)
participated antenatally but not postnatally. Those who re-
mained in the study were older, more likely to be of European
ethnicity, married, employed, born in New Zealand, have a
bachelor’
s degree or higher, and live in a low deprivation area
compared with those not completing the postnatal interview
Key Points
Question What demographic, social, relationship, and health
factors are associated with depression symptoms among men
whose partners are pregnant or recently gave birth?
Findings In a cohort study of 3523 men living in New Zealand, 2%
scored higher than 12 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale
during the third trimester of their partners’pregnancy and 4%
scored higher than 9 on the 9-item patient health questionnaire 9
months after childbirth. Fathers who were stressed or in poor
health had elevated depression symptoms during their partner’
s
pregnancy and 9 months after the birth of their child; postnatal
paternal depression symptoms were also associated with adverse
social and relationship factors.
Meaning The effect of parental depression on families and
children can be lowered if symptoms in both men and women are
identified early, treated, or prevented.

(all P < .05). A final sample of 3523 men was included in these
analyses (11 women, 10 nonbiological fathers, and 5 fathers not
in a relationship with a study mother at the time of the ante-
natal interview were excluded).
European or other (including Middle Eastern, Latin Ameri-
can, and African) participants composed 69.7% (n = 2451) of
the sample, followed by Māori, 9.5% (n = 333) Pacific Island,
9.0% (n = 317), and Asian, 11.8% (n = 414). The mean (SD) age
of the men at the antenatal evaluation was 33.20 (6.25) years
(range, 16-63 years).
Measures
Paternal ADS (PADS) were measured using the Edinburgh Post-
natal Depression Scale (EPDS), a tool also validated for use in
men. The EPDS has 10 items scored 0 to 3 (maximum score,
30), with a higher score indicating higher symptoms of
depression.41,42Inlinewithmanystudies,14,16participantswith
an EPDS score higher than 12 were said to have PADS corre-
sponding to an indication of probable depressive disorder.41
Maternal ADS/PDS were also assessed, using the EPDS cutoff
score of 12/13.
Paternal PDS (PPDS) were measured using the 9-item
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), a brief standardized
depression tool43 with excellent psychometric properties.
Each PHQ-9 item is scored 0 to 3 (maximum score, 27);
higher scores indicate more and/or greater-severity symp-
tomsofdepression.44-46ParticipantswithaPHQ-9scorehigher
than 9 were said to have PPDS, corresponding to an indica-
tion of mild to severe depression.47 The EPDS and PHQ-9 have
good concordance (87% for these cutoff scores).48
Self-reported paternal antenatal health variables in-
cluded perceived general health during the partner’
s preg-
nancy (5-point Likert scale, from excellent to poor, and from
the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey49), smoking, alcohol
consumption, disability or current health problems, and
whether they had ever been diagnosed as having depression
or anxiety. Participants also completed the 10-item Perceived
Stress Scale, with a higher score indicating higher levels of
stress.50 Warmth/Hostility Scale51 and Conflict scale52 scores
were combined to create a relationship environment score (po-
tential range, 15-105). Family Stress scale53 and informal Fam-
ily Support Scale54 items were combined to create a family en-
vironment score (potential range, 12-60). An external
environment score was calculated using the Neighborhood In-
tegrationscale55andexternalFamilySupportScale54items(po-
tential range, 16-86). Higher scores on these composites indi-
cated a better environment.
At the postnatal interview some of these measures were
repeated, including employment, socioeconomic status,
health, and smoking, and the Warmth/Hostility, Conflict, Fam-
ily Stress, Family Support, and Neighborhood Integration
scales. Participants were asked whether they were still in a
relationship with the mother of their Growing Up in New
Zealand study child.
Statistical Analysis
χ2 Tests were used to determine univariate associations be-
tween dependent variables and categorical independent vari-
ables. Wilcoxon signed rank test for 2 related samples and
Mann-Whitney tests examined associations between depen-
dent variables and nonparametric continuous independent
variables,and2-tailed,independent-samples(unpaired)ttests
were used for parametric continuous independent variables.
Factors associated with PADS/PPDS at P < .01 were included
in multivariable analyses using binary logistic regression. Sta-
tistical significance in regression analyses was given at P < .05.
The following analyses were carried out: (1) rates of PADS
(EPDS score >12) and PPDS (PHQ-9 score > 9), (2) univariate as-
sociations between maternal depression symptoms and PADS/
PPDS, (3) univariate associations between independent vari-
ables and PADS/PPDS (to determine which independent
variables to include in multivariable analyses), (4) multivari-
able analyses of pregnancy and prepregnancy independent
variables and PADS (to explore risks for PADS), (5) multivari-
able analyses of prepregnancy and pregnancy independent
variables and PPDS (for comparison with our group’
s report on
maternal depression), and (6) multivariable analyses of
prepregnancy, pregnancy, and postnatal independent vari-
ables and PPDS (to determine whether factors associated with
PPDS change according to whether they occur before or after
childbirth). Data analysis was performed from September 1,
2015, to January 8, 2016. Statistical analysis was conducted
using SPSS, version 23.0 (IBM Corp).
Results
Perinatal Depression Symptoms Among Men
Rates of PADS and PPDS were 2.3% (n = 82) and 4.3% (n = 153),
respectively (Figure 1). PADS was associated with PPDS
(χ2 = 62.67; P < .001). During the perinatal period, 217 men
(6.2%) experienced either PADS or PPDS, and 3306 (93.8%) did
nothaveelevateddepressionsymptoms.Eighteen(22.0%)men
who experienced PADS also had PPDS, and 18 (11.8%) of those
with PPDS had also experienced PADS.
Antenatally, 291 (8.3%) participants reported a clinical di-
agnosis of depression at some time in their life. Men with PADS
were more likely to report a history of depression than were

those without PADS (21 of 82 [25.6%] vs 270 of 3441 [7.8%];
χ2 = 33.35;P < .001).Similarly,menwithPPDSweremorelikely
to report a history of depression than were those without PPDS
(43 of 153 [28.1%] vs 248 of 3379 [7.4%]; χ2 = 83.12; P < .001).
Associations Between Paternal and Maternal
Depression Symptoms
Men with PADS were more likely to have a partner with ma-
ternal ADS than were men without PADS (21 of 82 [25.6%] vs
284 of 3425 [8.3%]; χ2 = 30.25; P < .001). Similarly, men with
PPDS were more likely to have a partner with ADS (26 of 153
[17.0%] vs 279 of 3354 [8.3%]; χ2 = 13.87; P < .001) or PDS (27
of 153 [17.6%] vs 207 of 3362 [6.2%]; χ2 = 31.09; P < .001) than
were those without PPDS.
Overall, male participants had lower mean (SD) total an-
tenatal EPDS scores (3.31 [3.51]) than their pregnant partners
(5.67 [4.59]; z = –25.47; P < .001). For participants who met
the criteria for ADS, EPDS total scores were similar for men
and their female partners (both 15.5 [2.5]). However, men
without PADS had lower mean antenatal EPDS scores (2.92
[2.94]) compared with their female partners without ADS
(4.70 [3.48] z = –22.13; P < .001).
Univariate Associations With PADS and PPDS
Table 1 and Table 2 report the univariate associations
between the independent variables and PADS and PPDS.
Paternal ADS was significantly associated with the following
paternal variables: perceived stress, relationship environ-
ment, family environment, ethnicity, self-reported diagno-
sis of a history of clinically diagnosed anxiety, health status,
alcohol consumption during their partner’
s pregnancy, rela-
tionship with the baby’
s mother, and being born outside of
New Zealand. There was a significant association for age,
educational level, disability, current smoking, workforce
status, and unplanned pregnancy. Paternal PDS was signifi-
cantly associated with the following paternal variables: age;
perceived stress score during the partner’
s pregnancy; rela-
tionship, family, and external environments; ethnicity; edu-
cational level; self-reported diagnosis of a history of anxi-
ety; disability; workforce status; socioeconomic status;
smoking; health status; relationship status; and unplanned
pregnancy.
Multivariable Prepregnancy and Pregnancy
Associations With PADS
The risk of PADS increased for men with higher perceived
stress (odds ratio [OR], 1.38; 95% CI, 1.30-1.47) and fair to
poor health (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.18-3.61). Participants who
reported drinking less than usual during their partner’
s
pregnancy were more likely to experience PADS (OR, 2.08;
95% CI, 1.04-4.18) (Tables 1 and 2).
Multivariable Prepregnancy and Pregnancy
Associations With PPDS
The risk of PPDS increased for men with higher antenatal per-
ceived stress (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.10-1.18), who smoked during
their partner’
s pregnancy (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.14-2.58), had fair
to poor health antenatally (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.13-2.54), or had
a history of depression (OR, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.71-4.59). Taking
thesefactorsintoaccount,menwithPADSwerenotmorelikely
to experience PPDS (Tables 1 and 2).
Multivariable Prepregnancy, Pregnancy,
and Postnatal Associations With PPDS
Antenatal variables that could have changed between the in-
terviews (employment; relationship and health status; mater-
nal ADS and PDS; deprivation; relationship, external, and fam-
ily environments; and smoking) were replaced with postnatal
measures.Tables1and2reportthat,whenconsideringprepreg-
nancy, antenatal, and postnatal factors, the risk of PPDS in-
creased for men with higher antenatal perceived stress (OR,
1.12; 95% CI, 1.08-1.17); more difficult postnatal relationship
environment (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99) or family environ-
ment (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.91-0.96); those no longer in a rela-
tionship with their child’
s mother (OR, 6.36; 95% CI, 2.28-
17.78); who were unemployed at the postnatal interview
(OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.11-3.10); smoked at both time points (OR,
1.66; 95% CI, 1.04-2.64); had fair to poor postnatal health (OR,
3.29; 95% CI, 2.10-5.16); or had a history of depression (OR,
2.84; 95% CI, 1.69-4.78). Figure 2 demonstrates the different
risks for PADS and PPDS.
Discussion
Our rates of PADS (2.3%) and PPDS (4.3%) were in line with
other studies using the same measures.14,56 Reported rates of
maternalADSandPDSintheGrowingUpinNewZealandStudy
were higher at 11.5% and 8.0%, respectively.5,6 Furthermore,
8.3% of the male participants reported a history of depres-
sion, compared with 17.9% of women.5 These findings are con-
sistent with the current evidence base.26,57-59
AntenatalEPDSscoresforparticipantsnotreachingthede-
pression cutoff score were lower for men than for women. It
is possible that symptoms in men are not continuously dis-
tributed and only men at risk of developing PADS have mood
difficulties during their partner’
s pregnancy, while women
more generally have mood difficulties. This suggests that only
at-risk men would benefit from intervention, but all pregnant
women (regardless of meeting the criteria for a clinical diag-
nosis) may benefit from support.
Our PADS rate of 2.3% is similar to estimated rates of de-
pression in the general male population.1 As such, pregnancy-
specific depression symptoms may be of less concern for men
than for women. However, our sample of men differed from
the general population in that all men had a partner at the start
of the study. Being married or cohabiting lowers the risk of de-
pression; therefore, the general rate of depression among part-
nered men may be lower compared with the rate in the gen-
eral male population.60,61
WefoundhigherratesofPPDS(4.3%)comparedwithPADS
(2.3%). The rate of incident postnatal depression (PPDS but no
PADS) was 3.8%. This difference may be attributable to being
a new father, but it may be that the PHQ-9 had greater
sensitivity in our sample compared with the EPDS. Using dif-
ferent scales limited our ability to fully explore longitudinal

Figure 2 shows the risks for maternal and paternal peri-
natal depression identified by this study and previous re-
ports from the Growing Up in New Zealand study. These risks
reflect existing evidence3,26,62 supporting the idea that men
and women have different risks in each perinatal period. This
finding has implications for the timing and targeting of screen-
ing and intervention. Expectant fathers should seek support
if they experience unemployment and/or relationship or fam-
ily difficulties following the birth of their child. Men who have
a history of mental health problems or who are stressed or un-
well during their partner’
s pregnancy should be assessed for
PPDS. Men should also be encouraged to give up smoking dur-
ing their partner’
s pregnancy and continue not to smoke after
the birth of their child.
Although associated at the univariate level, maternal ADS
and PDS were not a risk for PADS and PPDS in multivariable
analyses; this finding differs from other studies.3,12,16,26,56 Per-
haps the quality of the maternal-paternal relationship (in-
cluded in our study) is a more important risk for paternal de-
pression than maternal depression per se.21 We included men
who were no longer in a relationship with their child’
s mother
at 9 months. Only including couples who are still partnered
when PDS are measured may affect other study results on the
association between maternal and paternal depression. Our di-
vergent finding may reflect the ethnic makeup of other stud-
ies; many were predominantly European or gave little ethnic-
ity information.3,12,16,26,56 We found that Pacific ethnicity was
astrongindicatorofmaternalADSandPDS.5,6 Itispossiblethat
PacificIslandcultureprotectsmenagainstthehighlevelsofde-
pressionsymptomsamongtheirPacificpartners.Fathersinthe
Growing Up in New Zealand study were more likely to identify
as Māori or Pacific Islander compared with study mothers. This
difference may have been due to cultural differences in will-
ingness to take part, more Māori and Pacific Island men having
partners of different ethnicities, or men with multiple ethnici-
tiesbeingmorelikelytoprioritizeMāoriorPacificIslandastheir
main ethnicity and it may have affected our findings.
Implications
Reflecting the worldwide situation, New Zealand women are
assessed for PDS in the first 6 weeks after childbirth. How-
ever, there is no maternal screening during pregnancy and no
perinatal screening for men. Although the rates of PADS and
PPDS are lower than in mothers, some fathers struggle in the
perinatal period. In our study, the postnatal period was a time
of higher risk compared with the antenatal period. Paternal
perinatal depression was not more prevalent in any one eth-
nic group and was experienced by those with a range of edu-
cational level backgrounds, suggesting that screening needs
to be targeted at all fathers.
Discussing the risks of depression with expectant moth-
ersandfatherswouldprovideinformationaboutwheretoseek
help and social support should one of them develop symp-
toms. This communication could be the only way to reach fa-
therswhoarenolongerwiththemotherspostnatally.Ourstud-
ies suggest that family- and couple-based interventions that
focus on improving relationship quality and alleviating stress
in both men and women may benefit those at risk of develop-
ing ADS or PDS.
Strengths and Limitations
Follow-up diagnostic assessment of participants with PADS or
PPDS was not conducted and we could not determine whether
participants were receiving treatment for depression. The data
onprepregnancyandearlypregnancyvariablesmayhavebeen
affected by recall bias. Our results may not be generalizable
to the first and second trimesters of pregnancy or to the pe-
riod immediately following childbirth; these factors may have
affected our findings on links between maternal and paternal
depression.21
It was difficult to make direct comparisons of PADS and
PPDS because we used different measures in each perinatal pe-
riod. More factors were associated with PPDS than with PADS,
but it is unclear whether this is because there are different risks
for men in each period or because different measures were
used. The 7.8% of participants who were not assessed post-
natally were significantly different from those who com-
pleted both interviews, suggesting some selection bias.
The main strength of the study was the large sample, high
participation rates, low attrition, and good representation of
minority ethnic groups and those with low socioeconomic
status.39,63,64 Previous longitudinal studies have been smaller
and did not assess PADS.26,65 The Avon Longitudinal Study of
Parents and Children (N = 7018) is more comparable to ours,
although participants were assessed at different time points.33
Conclusions
Only relatively recently has the influence of fathers on chil-
dren been recognized as vital for adaptive psychosocial and
cognitive development. Given that paternal depression can
havedirectorindirecteffectsonchildren,itisimportanttorec-
ognize and treat symptoms among fathers early, and the first
step in doing that is arguably increasing awareness among fa-
thers about increased risks.
