Low-dose radiation from A-bombs
elongated lifespan and reduced cancer
mortality relative to un-irradiated
individuals
Shizuyo Sutou
Abstract
The US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) presented the linear no-threshold hypothesis (LNT) in 1956, which
indicates that the lowest doses of ionizing radiation are hazardous in proportion to the dose. This spurious
hypothesis was not based on solid data. NAS put forward the BEIR VII report in 2006 as evidence supporting LNT.
The study described in the report used data of the Life Span Study (LSS) of A-bomb survivors. Estimation of
exposure doses was based on initial radiation (5%) and neglected residual radiation (10%), leading to
underestimation of the doses. Residual radiation mainly consisted of fallout that poured down onto the ground
along with black rain. The black-rain-affected areas were wide. Not only A-bomb survivors but also not-in-the-city
control subjects (NIC) must have been exposed to residual radiation to a greater or lesser degree. Use of NIC as
negative controls constitutes a major failure in analyses of LSS. Another failure of LSS is its neglect of radiation
adaptive responses which include low-dose stimulation of DNA damage repair, removal of aberrant cells via
stimulated apoptosis, and elimination of cancer cells via stimulated anticancer immunity. LSS never incorporates
consideration of this possibility. When LSS data of longevity are examined, a clear J-shaped dose-response, a
hallmark of radiation hormesis, is apparent. Both A-bomb survivors and NIC showed longer than average lifespans.
Average solid cancer death ratios of both A-bomb survivors and NIC were lower than the average for Japanese
people, which is consistent with the occurrence of radiation adaptive responses (the bases for radiation hormesis),
essentially invalidating the LNT model. Nevertheless, LNT has served as the basis of radiation regulation policy. If it
were not for LNT, tremendous human, social, and economic losses would not have occurred in the aftermath of
the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant accident. For many reasons, LNT must be revised or abolished, with changes
based not on policy but on science.

Background
Japan is the only country that has sustained a nuclear at-
tack. The weapons dropped in 1945 killed approximately
200,000 people instantaneously. People around the world
have been taught for decades since that ionizing radi-
ation is limitlessly hazardous, This supposition is based
on a linear no-threshold model (LNT): even the lowest
doses of ionizing radiation are hazardous in proportion
to their doses, Therefore, it is quite natural that most
people think that ionizing radiation from the A-bombs
killed people, shortened lifespan, and increased cancer
mortality. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant
accident presented an opportunity to study the effects of
ionizing radiation on health, after which the author
published associated books [1, 2] and papers [3, 4].
Through their composition, it became increasingly clear
that LNT has a seriously flawed history [5]. The energy
of A-bombs comprised 35% thermal radiation (heat and
light), 50% blast energy (pressure shock waves), and 15%

 nuclear radiation [6]. In fact, instantaneous deaths were
mostly ascribable to thermal and blast energy (85%),
especially in the central area of the blast. People tend to
forget that victims of heat and blast were affected in a
moment or short period, whereas cancer induction has
remained a menace even to the present day. For survi-
vors of today, fear of A-bombs mostly overlaps with fear
of cancer. It is less well known that ionizing radiation is
not always hazardous. Low-dose radiation sometimes
stimulates our defense mechanisms and beneficial (radi-
ation hormesis) [7–10].
Taking these facts into consideration, the effects on
lifespan and cancer incidence of A-bomb survivors were
reexamined for the present analyses. Letting the data
speak, one would hear that low-dose radiation from
A-bombs has extended survivor lifespan and reduced
cancer mortality on average for A-bomb survivors and
not-in-the-city control subjects (NIC). The key to resolv-
ing the apparent discrepancy between the received
notions and actual data is radiation hormesis and the
radiation doses of a hormesis range to which a large
fraction of A-bomb survivors and NIC were exposed. Of
course, A-bomb survivors who received high doses
exhibited
shortened
lifespan
and
increased
cancer
mortality, but they accounted for a minor fraction of all
local residents. Therefore, results show that the “average
lifespan” was longer and that “average cancer mortality”
was reduced overall.
Radiation units such as rem, Sv, and Gy are used here
as reference articles use, unless otherwise specified.
Longer lifespan of some people who were heavily
irradiated by ionizing radiation
Reportedly the unhappiest man in the world, Mr. Tsu-
tomu Yamaguchi, was A-bombed at Hiroshima. Later he
relocated to Nagasaki, where he survived the second
A-bomb attack [11]. He survived the two A-bomb
attacks; he might be the happiest man in a sense that
more than 70 people were evacuated from Hiroshima to
Nagasaki: all except him were killed. More surprising is
that the two A-bombs did not shorten his life: he died of
stomach cancer at 93.
The Nikkei Shimbun reported on April 5, 2018 that
Chairman Sunao Tsuboi of the Japan Confederation of
A-Bomb
and
H-Bomb
Sufferers
Organizations
was
selected as an honorary citizen of Hiroshima City. When
he was 20, the A-bomb attacks occurred when he was 1.2
km from the epicenter. He is 93 in 2018. He talked to then
US President Obama to encourage efforts to abolish
nuclear weapons. The occasion on May 27, 2017 was the
first visit ever to Hiroshima by a serving president.
When he was 8, Shigeaki Mori was blown into a river-
bed from a bridge and injured 2.5 km from the epicenter.
He became a historian and discovered that American
victims of the A-bomb were present in Hiroshima. His
finding was reflected in President Obama’s speech, “Why
do we come to this place, to Hiroshima? We come to
ponder a terrible force unleashed in the not so distant
past. We come to mourn the dead, including over
100,000 Japanese men, women and children, thousands
of Koreans and a dozen Americans held prisoner.” After
the speech, a tearful Mori was embraced by Obama.
Born in 1937, he has lived longer than the average for
Japanese men.
Dr. Don Wiles, Emeritus Professor of Chemistry at
Carlton University, Canada, once engaged in extraction
of radium from uranium ore for 16 months from 1947.
Before the use of cobalt, radium ($20,000/g) encapsu-
lated in a glass tube was used to treat cancer by embed-
ding it into the malignant tissues. The crystallization
process used by Marie Curie 50 years before included
procedures that were apparently very lax and coarse
compared to the present standard: encapsulation was
performed with bare hands. Workers ignored the rule to
wear rubber gloves because they were slippery. Radiation
badges even under the lead shield became black at the
daily check. Because radium is similar to calcium in
terms of its chemical characteristics, radium was appar-
ently accumulated in Dr. Wiles’ bones. Born in 1925, he
exhaled about 25 times the legal maximum of radon, a
product of radium, at the age of 88. One might assume
that he was seriously injured. He stated “About 65 years
later, I am still healthy.” [12]. These are some examples
of increased longevity despite radiation exposure. Are
they exceptional?
A-bomb survivors lifespans are unusually long
Figure 1 presents changes of the number of certificate
holders who have been covered by the Law Concern-
ing Relief to Atomic Bomb Survivors. The holders are
regarded as A-bomb survivors. Until 1982, holders
were more than expected because additional people
had been admitted as holders; the holders’ superiority
in number does not necessarily mean that holders
had a long lifespan. After 1982, the expected number
became greater than the actual holders because few
people were admitted as new and holders were get-
ting steadily older year by year. The mortality ratio of
the Japanese that was used to calculate the expected
numbers was the average of infants, young people,
adults, and elderly people, producing a result that is
much less than that of the aged holders. Therefore,
the holders’ exposure and experience do not necessar-
ily mean that their lifespan is short.
The average lifespan of certificate holders was 80.13
for 2014. The ratio of men to women is not available.
The lifespan of Japanese men was 80.21 for 2013 and
that for women was 86.61; the average was 83.49.

 The life expectancy (for remaining life) at age 80 is
8.61 for men and 8.19 for women. Therefore, the
lifespan of A-bomb survivors is expected to be over
88, far exceeding the average. This elongated average
lifespan
of
holders
might
be
ascribable
to
good
medical services offered by the Japanese government.
This might have contributed to some degree, but
apparently some other important factor has an influ-
ence: low-dose radiation stimulates human biological
defense mechanisms.
A-bomb survivors lifespan was statistically
shortened
Cologne
and
Preston
investigated
the
longevity
of
120,321 A-bomb survivors [13]. They concluded that
“Median life expectancy decreased with increasing
radiation dose at a rate of about 1.3 years per Gy,
but declined more rapidly at high doses. Median loss
of life among cohort members with estimated doses
below 1 Gy was about 2 months, but among the
small
number
of
cohort
members
with
estimated
doses of 1 Gy or more it was 2.6 years. Median loss
of life among all individuals with greater-than-zero
dose
estimates
was
about
4
months.”
Almost
all
readers of the summary sentences above must believe
that ionizing radiation from A-bombs was hazardous
and that it shortened A-bomb survivors’ longevity to
a greater or lesser degree. One must nevertheless be
alert. The A-bomb survivors lifespan was not neces-
sarily shortened, as described later. When a model
cannot explain established facts, not the facts but the
model must be wrong. What reasons are there in the
discrepancy between actual life elongation and statis-
tical shortening of lifespan? Apparently, three major
factors engender wrong conclusions: 1) invalid LNT
was promulgated – one never considers life elong-
ation and cancer mortality reduction as effects of ra-
diation; 2) a false assumption (zero exposure-zero
risk) in NIC was used by neglecting residual radi-
ation;
and
3)
radiation
hormesis,
the
idea
that
low-dose radiation stimulates defense systems, was
neglected. These three points are briefly examined be-
fore returning to discussion of Cologne and Preston’s
data [13] later.
Fig. 1 Changes of people who have an A-Bomb Survivor’s Certificates (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare [68] (blue). For example, a total of
183,519 certificate holders in 2014 comprised four classes: 1st class survivors, or direct victims (113,685); 2nd class survivors, or in-city victims who
were within areas inside 2 km from the epicenter (42,529); 3rd class survivors, or rescue victims who engaged in rescue activities or physical
treatments outside the 2 km areas and who were exposed to residual radiation (20,013); and 4th class survivors, or fetuses of people in one of the
above three categories (7292). Their peak number was 372,264 in 1980. Expected numbers (red) were calculated as follows: holders in 1957 were
200,984; the death ratio of the Japanese in 1957 [69] was 0.008275 and 1663 (200,984 × 0.008275) were expected to die and 199,321 (200,984–
1663) was the expected number in 1958 (the same hereinafter). Certificate holders are supported financially with six allowances and funeral fees.
Some other benefits accrue: they can undergo free health examinations twice a year; and almost all sicknesses are treated at no charge. Patients
with illness caused by a nuclear weapon were eligible to receive an allowance of 138,380 yen/m. The health control allowance is 34,030 yen/m.
The funeral allowance is 206,000 yen. The total budget for fiscal year 2015 was 393,391,000,000 yen

 LNT is not based on solid data
Muller’s tenacity to maintain LNT
The origin of LNT dates back to 1927, when Muller
found that X-rays induced sex-linked recessive lethality
in Drosophila melanogaster [14]. This “data-poor/discus-
sion-rich” paper was quite likely to have cleverly circum-
vented the normal peer review process [15]. Later, he
presented related data. Apparent linearity at extremely
high doses was extrapolated to lower doses without ex-
perimental data. He put forward the proportionality rule,
an analog of LNT [16]. Then in 1939, World War II
(WWII) broke out. The United States of America (USA)
began production of the A-bomb under its Manhattan
Project. Radiation effects on living organisms were
investigated intensively. He learned of a threshold for
positive excess risk in recessive lethality tests of D.
melanogaster
[17].
The
US
dropped
A-bombs
on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Muller became a
Nobel laureate in 1946 for his radiation research.
Although he knew of thresholds to damage from
radiation, he declared in his Nobel Prize lecture that
there was “no escape from the conclusion that there
is no threshold dose” [18].
Oil industries felt uneasy about nuclear energy and took
over the National Academy of Sciences
Standard Oil Co. Inc. was founded by John Rockefeller
in 1870, who later established the Rockefeller Founda-
tion (RF) in 1913. The oil industry might well have felt
threatened by the discovery of atomic energy. The
Republican Party had forged a close relationship with
the oil industry, but the Democratic Party, led by F.D.
Roosevelt (1933–1945) and H. Truman (1945–1953),
governed the USA during and after WWII. When
Republicans
were reelected, Nelson Rockefeller was
appointed as an important aide to President Eisenhower.
Muller, in turn, had close ties to the RF. In 1954, the
RF chose to finance a large project to evaluate ioniz-
ing radiation. RF asked the U.S. National Academy of
Sciences (NAS) to organize the program, which was
conducted
under
the
auspices
of
NAS
President
Bronk of Rockefeller University, also an RF trustee.
The Genetics Panel (GP) of the NAS Biological Ef-
fects of Atomic Radiation (BEAR) committee was
established in 1954 and was chaired by Weaver, a
mathematician and director of RF.
With no significant discussion, GP recommended
LNT on June 12, 1956 [19]. The limit dose for nuclear
workers of 500 mGy/y, which had been in place since
1934, was discarded. The next day, the front page of the
New York Times, owned by an RF trustee, reported that
radiation is dangerous. Other media followed suit. Soon,
several leading biologists asked GP to provide documen-
tation that supported LNT. GP refused to do so because
they never possessed relevant data. This decision was
cast, and reasonably so, as an ideologically motivated
choice based on deliberate falsification and fabrication of
research records [20]. Fossil fuel companies are opposed
to nuclear energy even today.
Expansion of LNT from insect sperm to the human body
Lewis (a 1995 Nobel laureate) argued in 1957 that
radiation-induced
leukemia conformed
to
the
LNT
hypothesis [21]. This was a new deployment of LNT
from germ cells (heritable effects) to somatic cells (can-
cer induction). Several prominent researchers criticized
the Lewis’ paper (Table 2 in ref. [22]). With no convin-
cing data to support LNT reported for half a century,
the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation committee of
NAS published BEIR VII report in 2006 to support LNT
[23]. This report includes several shortcomings, as
discussed later. Moreover, LNT has been applied also to
chemical carcinogens; the smallest amount of a carcino-
gen is hazardous without threshold for positive excess
risk.
Radiation doses are underestimated by neglecting
residual radiation or black rain
Residual radiation and the formation of black rain
The radiation doses for A-bomb survivors were esti-
mated using radiation transport calculations based on
radiation transport findings from tests conducted on the
ground in the Nevada desert. The nuclear weapons
dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were detonated
respectively at 600 m and 503 m heights. To obtain more
accurate data, the ICHIBAN project was planned, for
which a 510 m high tower was constructed in the
Nevada desert [24]. A nuclear reactor or other radiation
source was placed at the top of the tower and data were
collected. The dosimetry of the ICHIBAN project was
named tentative dose 1965 (T65D). Around the 1980s,
results demonstrated that T65D did not correctly reflect
A-bomb radiation intensity. Exposure doses were reexa-
mined, after which the Dose System 1986 (DS86) was
established. In the period around the 1990s, DS86 was
revised again; Dose System 2002 (DS02) was established.
DS02 was revised further as DS02R1, producing the
current system used to estimate the exposure doses of
A-bomb survivors [25]. Although dose systems have
been revised several times, T65D is the basic one. Others
are modified versions that do not deviate greatly from
T65D. T65D was an outcome of a large-scale simulation
model of A-bombs, but it included an important over-
sight, i.e., omission of residual radiation with a dose
twice as large as the initial radiation on which the dose
estimation was made.
The energy of a typical A-bomb comprises three
components: 35% thermal radiation (heat and light), 50%
Sutou Genes and Environment           (2018) 40:26

 blast energy (pressure shock wave), and 15% nuclear
radiation [6]. Of that latter 15%, 5% is initial radiation
(released within 30 s). The remaining 10% is residual ra-
diation, which consists of major fallout and minor in-
duced radioactivity. Induced radioactivity is produced by
the action of neutrons in making non-radioactive sub-
stances into radioactive ones, but its lifespan is very
short and is mostly negligible. A large fraction of the
fallout, 40–70%, is believed to settle onto the ground
within a day, but this depends strongly on weather and
geographical features. When T65D was established,
Black rain never fell in the Nevada desert. At Hiroshima
and Nagasaki, thermal radiation incinerated or scalded
plants, animals (including humans), houses, and various
organic substances, producing heat, carbon dioxide, and
vapor and consuming oxygen. Heat killed people. A lack
of oxygen contributed deaths by suffocation. Victims
were therefore affected in various ways by the A-bombs.
From many waterways in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, large
volumes of water were evaporated. The water itself was
sucked up as if by a tornado. The vapor and water went
up into the sky and cooled, thereafter forming raindrops
containing soot and other debris. The resultant black
rain started to pour down 20–30 min after the deton-
ation. The rainfall lasted for a few hours (Fig. 2). The
heavy black rain is well known to be highly radioactive.
The possibility exists that the black rain included the
most fallout, two-thirds of the nuclear radiation energy,
i.e., twice as much radiation as the initial radiation used
to estimate the radiation doses.
Evidence that residual radiation fell to the ground with
the black rain
An old Japanese article written in 1957 by G. Obo [26]
was later translated into English [27]. For the article,
approximately 4000 people who lived in a 7 km radius
from the epicenter were interviewed personally if they
entered the central area 1 km radius from the epicenter
and if they had radiation acute effects such as skin burn,
external injury, fever, diarrhea, sore throat, skin bleeding,
or loss of hair. Students of Hiroshima University took
part in this study. Fundamentally important data are
presented in Fig. 3.
The left panel of Fig. 3 shows 1) positive relations
between people with symptoms and distance from the
epicenter, 2) outdoor people as more severely affected
than indoor people as a matter of course, 3) people in
the areas ≥3 km from ground zero (beyond the reach of
γ-rays and neutrons from initial radiation) were affected,
implying that this area was contaminated severely by
residual radiation most probably carried by black rain,
and 4) indoor and outdoor people who were at a
distance ≥4 km and who entered the central areas were
affected almost equally independent of their distance
from the epicenter, strongly suggesting effects of residual
radiation. The right panel of Fig. 3 shows that a large
Fig. 2 Formation of black rain from the mushroom cloud (left), and black rain areas (right) [27]. Left: The A-bombs used to attack Hiroshima (16 kt TNT
equivalent) and Nagasaki (21 kt TNT equivalent) were detonated respectively at 600 m and 503 m heights. A 500-m diameter fireball is formed by the
detonation of a 20 kt bomb. The fireball rose like a skyrocket. During expansion of the ball, vaporized matter was condensed to a doughnut-shaped
cloud with violent internal circulatory motion. Following the rising fireball, dirt and debris were sucked up from the Earth’s surface. A Mach wave (the
tip reaching 560 m 1.25 s after the blast) was reflected from the surface, whirling soil and debris up to form a Mach wave mass of 3800 t, providing
black rain with raw materials together with the mushroom components. Trees, lumber, and other matter of 1.55 × 105 t were incinerated, forming a
smoky fire 2 km in diameter, above the ground. Two references [70, 71] were used to draw this figure. Right: The probable heavy rain area reported in
1953 is shown as a thick broken line. That of light rain is shown as a thin broken line. The black rain area according to analyses of the “A-bomb
Survivors’ health awareness survey” in 2008 is shown as a solid red line (Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum). A red circle off center denotes the
epicenter. Black dots around the epicenter show locations of A-bomb survivors at the T65D survey [72]

 fraction of non-A-bomb survivors entered the central
area 2–3 weeks after detonation suffered from severe
radiation sickness as if they were A-bomb survivors.
This result indicates strongly that the area was heavily
contaminated with residual radiation associated with
black rain.
Report that black rain is negligible is refutable
The effects of black rain were studied using mortality
data from 1950 to 2005 and cancer incidence data from
1958 to 2005 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The authors
conclude that deleterious health effects from black rain
exposure were not detected [28]. However, there is
apparently a methodical fault. The authors asked people,
“Was the person caught in Fallout Rain?” (Yes or No).
According to the response, they were then divided into
Yes or No groups. This grouping is almost meaningless
because the important matter is not Yes or No, but if
they had entered black rain affected areas within 2–3
weeks after detonation when residual materials remained
active (Fig. 3). When solid cancer deaths and solid
cancer incidence are extracted from the literature [28],
excess relative risks (ERR) were smaller in the Yes group
(caught in the rain) than in the No group (not caught in
the rain) (Table 1). The data are suggestive of hormesis:
slight radiation exposure is cancer-inhibitory.
The black rain affected areas were so wide that almost
all A-bomb survivors and NIC must have been irradiated

(1500–1999 m

in spite of an estimated dose of 50 rem (500 mSv in
the International System of Units (SI)). Their doses
must have been greater than 50 rem [29]. Exposure of
around 2 Gy (close to 2 Sv in SI) is necessary to induce
severe radiation sickness.
BEIR VII report fails to support LNT
BEIR VII report, the second problematic assertion by the
National Academy of Sciences
Originally, LNT was based on Muller’s experiments
using repair-deficient Drosophila sperm [14]. He knew
of the existence of thresholds for positive excess risk
in Drosophila tests [17]. Indeed, later experiments by
Japanese researchers indicate clearly that Drosophila
irradiated with X-rays [30] or γ-rays [31] show not only
thresholds but also hormesis. Hormesis has been observed
in A-bomb survivors for solid cancers [32] and leukemia
[33]. In spite of a large body of experimental data against
LNT, NAS, the founder and advocator of LNT since 1956
[19],
presented
the
BEIR
VII
report
as
basic
LNT-supportive data (Fig. 4) [23]. The support, based on
a Life Span Study (LSS) of A-bomb survivors, has been
regarded as the gold standard to estimate radiation risk
for human cancer. Nevertheless, this analysis presents ser-
ious flaws as explained below.
By the way, both Sv and Gy units are used accord-
ing to original references in Fig. 4. Sv is a suitable
unit for LNT and more generally acceptable Gy is
used in this chapter.
Leukemia, a better indicator of radiation stochastic
effects than solid cancer
Leukemia, a cancer of the blood cells, is a better indica-
tor of radiation than problematic solid cancers because
it is sensitive to radiation. It appears around 2 years
after exposure and reaches a peak 6–8 years later,
whereas solid cancers start to appear around 10 years
after exposure and last for decades. Figure 4 (upper left
insert, blue arrow) shows that ERR/Gy for leukemia is
approximately 2, whereas that for solid cancer is
approximately 0.55 (lower left, purple arrow). There-
fore, leukemia is sensitive to radiation and a better
indicator than solid cancers. The dose-response of
leukemia is not linear but is instead linear-quadratic
(upper left insert). That of solid cancer also fits better
to linear-quadratic (red arrow) than linearity (orange
arrow),
but
no
statistical
significance
was
found
between the two; BEIR VII asserts linearity. This
forcible logic is difficult to accept. Moreover, when
taking into consideration neglected residual radiation,
effects of blast/thermal wave injury on the immune
system, and hormesis, dose responses might be deviated
far from linearity.
Fig. 4 Excess relative risk (ERR) of solid cancers for Japanese A-bomb survivors [23]. The plotted vertical lines represent approximate 95%
confidence intervals. The thin blue, purple, red, and orange arrows respectively indicate ERR/Sv for leukemia, ERR/Sv for solid cancer, linear
quadratic fit, and linear fit. The lower left area in pale green is enlarged as the lower right insert, which shows the results of two statistical
analyses [35]. The black straight and dotted lines respectively show the linear fit of LNT and 95% confidence intervals. The red continuous and
dotted lines respectively show the Bayesian fit and 95% credible interval. The black arrow indicates only one dot inside the 95% confidence
intervals. Less than 100 mSv constitutes the low-dose range

 Concealment of downturn
When radiation doses are much higher than 2 Gy,
exposed people tend to die of adverse effects before
reaching an age when cancer commonly occurs; ERR
would show a downturn until finally reaching zero. The
highest dose in Fig. 4 is 2 Gy, which conceals the down-
turn. Indeed, “The dose-response curve shows some
downward bending in the high-dose range (2 + Gy in
organ dose) for leukemia and even for all cancer except
leukemia” [34]. When following the dots in Fig. 4 from
low to high with downturn over 2 Gy in mind, one can
easily imagine a sigmoid-like curve. This is shown by
Bayesian analysis of LSS (Fig. 4, right below insert) [35].
A J-shaped curve is observed for solid cancers [36, 37]
and leukemia mortality [33] in LSS. When hormesis and
a downturn occur, the actual curve becomes instead an
S-shaped curve [1].
Averaging of low-dose groups
Doses < 100 mGy are the most important for our risk
analyses. No significant differences were found between
the control subjects and A-bomb survivors at these
doses. The BEIR VII report combined all data points <
100 mGy, to which more than 80% of all survivors
belong, together into one point (Fig. 4). This has been
explained as an old statistical trick. It was used by Lewis
to insist on the validity of LNT [21]. This dishonest
representation was successful in giving the impression
that the dose response is linear and that no thresholds
exist. The low-dose area < 400 mGy (Fig. 4, lower left in
pale green) is presented in detail (lower right in pale
green) [35]. The ERR dots are dispersed widely: only 1
dot (black arrow in lower right insert) out of 12 is inside
the
95%
confidence
interval,
indicating
that
dose
responses are not linear in this area.
Inappropriate use of a false assumption (zero exposure-
zero risk)
The line of LNT starts from zero according to the
assumption that the exposure dose was zero and that
ERR was zero in the control cohort (Fig. 4). This default
model has been used to analyze LSS, but it is misleading
because most A-bomb survivors and the control cohort
people must have been exposed to residual radiation, as
discussed later. The BEIR VII report based on that false
assumption is therefore invalid. The dose-response line
should not start from zero. Bayesian analysis does not
assume this false assumption and allows more appropri-
ate estimates. When the lower right insert of Fig. 4 is en-
larged, crossing between the x-axis and the red line is
roughly 25 mGy. An estimated zero dose might actually
be 25 mGy. If these people were exposed to residual ra-
diation, which was twice as great as the initial radiation,
then A-bomb survivors and control subjects might have
been exposed to additional 50 mGy: a total of 75 mGy.
LNT ignores hormesis and thresholds
Granted that A-bomb survivors and control NIC people
were exposed to 25–75 mGy over the estimates, the false
assumption (zero exposure-zero risk) must be abandoned.
Bayesian analysis, which does not need this assumption,
allows
negative
responses,
i.e.,
cancer
mortality
is
suppressed to below the background level. Figure 4 shows
that six responses are indeed hormetic (red dots under the
x-axis in lower right insert). Therefore, low-dose radiation
can suppress cancer deaths. At the same time, hormesis
indicates that thresholds for positive excess risk can be
established between hormetic and carcinogenic doses.
Cherry picking of reference data
Siegel et al. [38] criticized The BEIR VII report in detail.
One point is especially worthy of mention. The BEIR VII
report cited that chromosomal aberrations induced by
low-dose radiation in non-proliferating human cells were
not repaired, thereby supporting LNT. However, that
finding was a misrepresentation by failing to present
that
the
aberrations
in
proliferating
cells
were
repaired in several hours to the background level or
less. Consequently, the result was opposite to what
the BEIR VII argues.
Low-dose radiation elongates A-bomb survivors’
lifespan
Earlier studies of lifespan elongation
Stewart and Kneale [39] showed that deaths in 1950–
1982 from all non-malignant diseases in LSS population
were significantly lower in survivors exposed to low
doses than in unexposed persons. This U-shaped dose
response relationship was refuted in comments by an
LSS report [40], in which the mortality of A-bomb survi-
vors was found to fit to the linear-threshold model (the
estimated threshold is 1.4 Gy (DS86)) on the basis of
LNT. Mine et al. [41] and Kondo [42] analyzed total
deaths among about 100,000 A-bomb survivors in
Nagasaki in1970–1988 and found that 290 males ex-
posed to 0.5–1.49 Gy (T65D) showed significantly lower
mortality. Although this beneficial effect was not found
in female subjects, earlier studies [39, 41, 42] hint that
A-bomb survivors exposed to low to intermediate doses
live longer.
Contradiction 1: Excess relative mortality of early entrants
is lower than that of late entrants
A-bomb survivors’ lifespans were apparently shortened
as discussed earlier. Cologne and Preston’s analyses [13]
were based on LNT using an assumption of zero expos-
ure
and
zero
risk,
with
no
consideration
of
the
Sutou Genes and Environment           (2018) 40:26 
Page 8 of 14
 possibility that lifespans could be elongated and that
cancer deaths might be reduced. Their results are
reproduced in Fig. 5.
As depicted in Fig. 3, early entrants were exposed to
higher doses of residual radiation than late entrants.
Excess relative mortality of early entrants, however, is
lower than that of late entrants (Fig. 5A and B). The key
to resolve this contradiction can be explained by radi-
ation hormesis-related mechanisms (e.g., enhanced DNA
damage repair, apoptotic removal of aberrant cells, and
anticancer immunity stimulation): the B group people
were exposed to higher residual radiation than the A
group people. Exposure doses of the B group must be in
a hormetic dose range.
Contradiction 2: Excess relative mortality is inversely
proportional to distance from the epicenter
Radiation doses are expected to be higher in proximal
areas than in distal ones. If LNT is correct, then excess
relative mortality must be higher in proximal areas. Data
show inverse proportionality (Figs. 5C–F). Because the
number of people is not small and mortality (death or
life) data are accurate, the neat inverse proportionality
must be close to the truth. Here again, this contradiction
must be explained by radiation hormesis. People nearer
the epicenter received more radiation than people far-
ther away. Hormesis-related natural defense mechanisms
also likely played a positive role in elongating the
lifespan of survivors.
Excess relative mortality shows a typical J-shaped curve,
indicating hormesis and a threshold
The radiation dose group of 0.005–250 mGy (Fig. 4, G
group) comprises 40,403 people. Its excess relative
mortality is almost equal to that of all in-city individuals
(n = 34,064, a total of C to F groups) whose radiation
doses are estimated to be zero or < 0.005 mGy (Fig. 4,
control level Y). Considering the large population size, a
lack of health hazard observed in group G would not be
ascribable to a simple fluctuation: it must reflect actual
effects of 0–250 mGy. If they were exposed to residual
radiation, which was twice as strong as the initial radi-
ation, then they might have been exposed to additional
0–500 mGy, a total of 0–750 mGy.
The excess relative mortality of H group (250–499
mGy is slightly higher than that of G group (0–250
mGy) and almost equal to D group (3–7 km from the
epicenter). The mortality is below the control level X.
These fluctuations are not random. At a glance from C
to M in Fig. 5, one can see a beautiful J-shaped curve, an
indicator of hormesis. When a J-shaped curve appears,
we can establish a threshold at the crossing of the J and
the x-axis. The threshold seems be between 250 and
499 mGy.
Perhaps
we
could
add
500–998 mGy
of
Fig. 5 Excess relative mortality by radiation dose or distance from the hypocenter. Figure 1 and Table 1 of an earlier report [13] are combined.
The scale from left to right shows increasing proximity to the epicenter: A, late entrants (not in city, entered after 1 month); B, early entrants (not
in city, entered within 1 month); C–F, in city at time of A-bomb, with different distance from the epicenter; G–M, seven dose groups with
different doses; and N, distance from the hypocenter = 0.11–3 km with unknown doses. Numerals above A–N denote the number of people
examined. The comparison group Y (baseline mortality, or excess relative mortality 0) is all in-city individuals (n = 34,064) with estimated doses of
zero or < 0.005 Gy. Dashed line X is the in city zero dose distal groups C and D (n = 25,524). Dotted line Z is the in-city zero-dose proximal groups

 residual radiation, twice as much radiation as estimated
doses.
Cancer mortality of A-bomb survivors has been
lower than the Japanese average
The US National Academy of Sciences proposed the
spurious LNT in 1956 and put forward the problematic
BEIR VII report in 2006 to support LNT (Fig. 4) [23].
The main reasons for the failure of the report are the
use
of
LNT,
use
of
the
false
assumption
(zero
exposure-zero risk), and neglect of hormesis effects. The
Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF), a Japan–
US scientific organization, has studied the health effects
of A-bomb radiation. RERF has periodically reported
research results and has insisted that the effects of
radiation follow LNT in line with the BEIR VII report.
The numbers of A-bomb survivors and solid cancer
deaths are extracted from the latest three issues and are
compared with Japanese averages (Table 2). The ratios of
cancer deaths in both A-bomb survivors and NIC are
smaller than those of Japanese averages. The numbers of
people involved in Table 2 are not small. The differences
are clear. Data must closely approximate reality. The
finding that radiation of A-bombs reduces cancer mor-
tality on average might be unexpected and incredible for
LNT supporters. Nevertheless, such conclusions might
be readily acceptable when one admits that low-dose
radiation is hormetic under appropriate conditions and
both A-bomb survivors and NIC who were exposed to
low-dose radiation occupy a large fraction of the cohort.
Consequently, low-dose radiation reduces cancer mor-
tality on average and extends the lifespan (Fig. 5) as well.
Discussion
Earth has been exposed to ionizing radiation for billions
of years
The current total heat flux from the Earth to space
consists of half residual primordial heat and half radio-
genic
decay
of
uranium-238,
thorium-232,
and
potassium-40, the respective half lives of which are 4.46,
14.0, and 1.28 billion years [43]. Therefore, radioactivity
was much higher 4 billion years ago when life started to
appear on the earth. Radioactivity at our university
campus in the air is less than 100 cpm, as measured with
a Geiger–Muller counter, but that of nearby granite is
around 500 cpm or so. Radioactive substances from the
birth of the earth are still abundant on the earth now.
Radon-222, a daughter of uranium-238, and radon-rich
hot springs are frequently found around uranium ore.
The human body receive roughly 20,000 radiation hits
each second
In addition, carbon-14 and tritium-3 are constantly pro-
duced by the action of cosmic rays in the atmosphere.
They are incorporated into our bodies. Japanese foods
contain polonium-210 and potassium-40 and commit an
effective dose of 0.47 mSv [44]. Consequently, the total of
our annual background exposure dose is 2.1 mSv: cosmic
rays (0.3 mSv), ground radiation (0.33 mSv), foods (0.99
mSv from carbon-14, polonium-210, and potassium-40),
and aerial radon (0.48 mSv) [45]. When these radiation
levels are converted to Bq (disintegration/second) using
an Sv-Bq conversion table, rough estimation is 20,000 Bq.
Potassium, an indispensable nutrient, and its associated
potassium-40 (0.0117% of all naturally occurring potas-
sium) contribute 4000 Bq. Therefore, we are exposed to
by and large 20,000 radiation hits a second from not only
the environment but also from materials inside our body.
We ourselves are radioactive entities. In actuality, sleeping
next to someone exposes one to 0.00005 mSv, which is the
equivalent of eating half of a banana (0.0001 mSv). Living
within 80 km of a nuclear plant and a coal plant for a year
are, respectively, 0.00009 mSv and 0.0003 mSv. The dose
of a chest X-ray is 0.02 mSv (ca. 1,000,000,000,000 hits
[46]). A jet-liner flight from New York to London is 0.04
mSv [47]. Of course, these estimates are quite rough with
significant uncertainties.
Breathing is much more hazardous than low-dose
radiation
The earth was anaerobic until 2.5 billion years ago when
cyanobacteria started to add oxygen into the air. Oxygen

 is actually toxic, but it is useful to produce energy effect-
ively through oxidative phosphorylation. Our ancestors
started to use oxygen, but reactive oxygen species (ROS)
are inescapable byproducts of the oxidative process.
ROS themselves are toxic. Nine billion ROS are pro-
duced in a cell a day [48]. We developed systems to
quench ROS instantaneously using radical scavengers
such as glutathione and L-cysteine and using enzymes
such as superoxide dismutase and catalase.
Hazards by both respiration and low-dose ionizing ra-
diation are caused mainly by ROS, but ROS production
by respiration overwhelms that by low-dose radiation by
thousands
to
a
million
of
times
the
magnitude.
ROS-quenching
systems
developed
under
intensive
ionizing radiation conditions for more than billion years
before the appearance of oxygen in the air must be
readily applied to quench ROS by respiration.
Low-dose radiation is not only beneficial but necessary
A benefit of oxygen beyond energy production is the
shielding of ultraviolet (UV) light. We sometimes expose
clothes and mats to the sunlight to dry them and
simultaneously kill bacteria, fungi, and ticks. We are
suntanned in the sun, by which dead epithelial cells are
shed from the skin when UV is strong. When oxygen
was not in the air, UV was so strong that organisms
were unable to live on the ground. The ozone layer cuts
most UV; organisms today can move across the ground.
Although UV can kill some organisms, it is indispensable
to produce vitamin D. We are using the toxic UV as a
need. So are ROS. When leukocytes “eat” bacteria, they
enzymatically produce large quantities of ROS to kill
them. ROS are sufficient to kill bacteria, but cells are
also killed later. We used to see pus, a pile of dead
leukocytes, in or around the wound before antibiotics
became popular. In fact, J.F. Miesher extracted DNA
from pus for the first time in 1869.
Figure 5 and Table 2 respectively show radiation-hor-
mesis-related benefits: 1) elongating of lifespan and 2)
reduced cancer deaths. Other analyses of LSS show
hormesis in solid cancers [32] and leukemia [33]. Horm-
esis has been reported for many organisms such as
protozoa [49], Drosophila [30, 31], and mice [50]. Lung
cancer incidence of humans exposed to radon-222 is
also hormetic [51]. These are some examples, constitut-
ing only the tip of the iceberg. Radiation-hormesis-re-
lated health benefits are possibly universal among all
living organisms. Low-dose radiation is apparently not
only beneficial but also necessary. When human cells
were cultured under unshielded (1.75 mGy/y) and 10 cm
lead-shielded (0.3 mGy/y) conditions, heat shock pro-
teins (products of adaptive responses) were produced
more in shielded cells than in unshielded cells, indicating
that reduced radiation was not relief, but was stressful to
the cells [52]. When bacteria were cultured 650 m under-
ground, where radiation levels were 1/80 those at ground
level, bacterial growth was retarded [52, 53]. If LNT is
correct, then growth should be enhanced by removal of
hazardous ionizing radiation. The results were the oppos-
ite, indicating the failure of LNT. Low-dose radiation is
sensed by bacteria and gene expression is changed greatly
at the transcriptional level [54].
Systematically associated many-layered defense
mechanisms that LNT ignores
The sanctuary zone of a 30 km radius in Chernobyl is a
paradise for animals and birds. More than 315 species
thrive there. Glutathione levels of rats are elevated, but
no DNA lesions are found on the animals. Levels of this
radical scavenger in birds of 16 species are also high
[55]. The authors argue that hormesis is working there.
Consequently, ROS are quenched before attacking DNA.
If DNA is injured by a large amount of ROS, cells can
repair most of them. If DNA injuries exceed the repair
capacity, cells are killed by apoptosis and are removed. If
cancerous cells are produced, then most of them are
removed by vigilant survey of immune systems. These
adaptive
defense
systems
are
only
some
examples
acquired by living organisms through evolution as innate
essential attributes. Humans have the ability to sense cri-
sis and to prepare for defense. Even if ionizing radiation
is neither seen nor sensed, its products, ROS, constitute
signaling molecules for defense systems. Defense systems
at various levels (cells, tissues, organs, etc.) by various
mechanisms (ROS quenching, DNA repair, apoptosis,
anticancer immunity, etc.) must be associated with hor-
metic dose-response relationship for radiation induced
cancer. A fundamental failure of LNT is that it ignores
these time-requiring biological systems. Indeed, LNT is
aptly accused of “epidemiology without biology” [56].
Magic of epidemiology to change negative to positive
A large body of experimentally obtained results collect-
ively indicates radiation hormesis, but LNT proponents
ignore these data. Risk of death from leukemia and
lymphoma in more than 300,000 radiation-monitored
workers (INWORKS) was studied. Results indicate that
the dose-response matched well with LNT [57]. This re-
sult was praised in an internationally prestigious journal:
Nature [58]. Soon more than 20 researchers raised
objections, some of which included 1) lack of negative
control, 2) LNT-based analyses, 3) no consideration of
natural background and smoking, 4) 90% confidence
limits (usually 95%) to achieve easy statistical signifi-
cance, 5) one-tailed tests ignoring possible hormetic
response, and 6) primitive miscalculations a schoolboy
would not make. Soon a correction appeared in Nature,
“The original version of this article incorrectly calculated
Sutou Genes and Environment           (2018) 40:26 
Page 11 of 14
 an ‘expected’ death rate from leukaemia among the
workers, and as a result, the risk posed by radiation
increments was wrong. The story has been corrected to
reflect this.” At least two works have leveled detailed
criticisms against INWORKS studies [59, 60]. Epidemi-
ology is apparently the last foothold for LNT, but “flexi-
bility in data collection and analysis allows presenting
anything as significant” [61]. The present author re-
quired no sophisticated epidemiology to find the oppos-
ite of what the authors assert in elongation of lifespan in
Fig. 5 and a decrease of cancer mortality in Table 2.
Tremendous human, social, and economic losses caused
by obstinate application of the linear no-threshold model
The individual external doses of 421,394 Fukushima res-
idents for the first 4 months after the 2011 earthquake
and tsunami were the following: 62.0%, < 1 mSv; 94.0%,
< 2 mSv; 99.4%, < 3 mSv. The arithmetic mean and max-
imum for individual external doses were 0.8 and 25 mSv,
respectively [62]. When actual external exposure doses
estimated by individual glass-badge measurements in
Date City, Fukushima, were compared with official
ambient doses presented by the Japanese government,
the ratio was 0.15 [63]. If this figure is applied to the
data above [62], then the effective doses can be calcu-
lated as follows: 62.0%, < 0.15 mSv; 94.0%, < 0.3 mSv;
99.4%, < 0.45 mSv. The respective mean and maximum
doses were 0.12 and 3.75 mSv. Even the maximum exter-
nal dose is below the Japanese average medical exposure
dose: 4 mSv. At the time of the Fukxushima nuclear
accident, the International Commission on Radiological
Protection (ICRP) recommended reference levels of 20–
100 mSv [64]. Less than 100 mSv, the so-called low-dose
range (Fig. 4), is accepted as representing no difference
between exposed and non-exposed people. These are
acute doses. Hazardous effects can be reduced to 1/16.5
by prolonged radiation such as in Fukushima [65],
meaning that 1.65 Sv (100 × 16.4 mSv) might be non-
hazardous. If it were not for LNT, evacuation would not
have been necessary in Chernobyl or Fukushima [37]. In
Ramsar, Iran, people have lived continuously in environ-
ments
of
260 mSv
with
no
health
problems
[66].
Tremendous human, social, and economic losses caused
by obstinate application of the failed LNT could have
been avoided [3]. In truth, LNT is a deeply immoral.
Prof. G. Walinder’s words, “The LNT hypothesis is a
primitive, unscientific idea that cannot be justified by
current scientific understanding. As practiced by the
modern
radiation
protection
community,
the
LNT
hypothesis is one of the greatest scientific scandals of
our time.” Madame M. Curie’s words, “Nothing in life is
to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time
to understand more, so that we might fear less.” It is the
time to reconsider the use of the LNT [67]. The author’s
sincere hope is that some unmasking of LNT can help
Fukushima people and others to live their lives free of
irrational fear.
Conclusion
The linear no-threshold hypothesis (LNT) was recom-
mended without solid data by the National Academy of
Sciences in 1956. The academy put forward the BEIR
VII report in 2006 as supporting evidence of LNT. This
report was based on the Life Span Study (LSS) of
A-bomb survivors. LSS has three major defects: 1)
Residual radiation to which both A-bomb survivors and
control subjects were exposed was neglected. Specific-
ally, the control subjects were not valid as representing
the negative control. 2) LNT is the basis of risk analyses.
The failed model cannot be used. 3) Radiation hormesis
is beyond the scope of LSS, but it actually occurs. The
average lifespan of A-bomb survivors is longer than the
Japanese average. Solid cancer deaths of A-bomb survi-
vors and control subjects were fewer than the Japanese
average. Consequently, one can reasonably infer that ra-
diation of A-bombs elongated their lifespan and reduced
cancer deaths on average, indicating a failure of LNT.
Unfortunately, LNT has served as the basis of radiation
regulation. If it were not for LNT, then evacuation of
Fukushima people would not have been mandated and
tremendous human, social, and economic losses would
have been avoided. To avoid unnecessary losses and fear,
humanity must learn as soon as possible that low-dose
radiation is not only harmless but beneficial.

that they have no mammalian sex determining gene SRY. Pancreatic cancer
was found in Dr. Tsuchiya 1 year and 9 months ago. I recommended
radiation hormesis therapy to him. He showed willingness to use it, but LNT
has prevented development of this therapy in Japan.

The author was taught that ionizing radiation is limitlessly hazardous until
March 2011. On the occasion of volunteer activity in Fukushima to measure
contamination of evacuees, I examined the effects of ionizing radiation and
found that LNT is invalid. As a scientist, I would like to relieve as many
