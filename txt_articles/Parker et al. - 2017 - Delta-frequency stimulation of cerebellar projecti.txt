Abstract
Schizophrenia involves abnormalities in the medial frontal cortex that lead to cognitive deficits. 
Here we investigate a novel strategy to normalize medial frontal brain activity by stimulating 
cerebellar projections. We used an interval timing task to study elementary cognitive processing 
that requires both frontal and cerebellar networks that are disrupted in patients with schizophrenia. 
We report three novel findings. First, patients with schizophrenia had dysfunctional delta rhythms 
between 1–4 Hz in the medial frontal cortex. We explored cerebellar-frontal interactions in animal 
models and found that both frontal and cerebellar neurons were modulated during interval timing 
and had delta-frequency interactions. Finally, delta-frequency optogenetic stimulation of thalamic 
synaptic terminals of lateral cerebellar projection neurons rescued timing performance as well as 
medial frontal activity in a rodent model of schizophrenia-related frontal dysfunction. These data 
provide insight into how the cerebellum influences medial frontal networks and the role of the 
cerebellum in cognitive processing.
INTRODUCTION
Frontal brain regions are dysfunctional in schizophrenia1,2 and contribute to debilitating and 
difficult to treat negative symptoms including impaired cognitive processes such as working 
memory, attention and planning.2,3 Few therapies specifically target frontal dysfunction or 
reliably improve cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. One unexplored possibility is to 
target cerebellar circuits.4,5 The cerebellum contributes to cognitive function,6–8 and

 functional neuroimaging studies reveal lateral cerebellar activations in concurrence with 
frontal activation during cognitive tasks requiring working memory and executive function.9 
Output from cerebellar hemispheres is relayed through lateral deep cerebellar nuclei10 and 
these projections to medial frontal cortex (MFC) can be compromised in schizophrenia.11 A 
recent proof of principle study indicated that cerebellar stimulation can attenuate some 
negative symptoms of schizophrenia.12 A randomized double-blind study further replicated 
these findings,13 yet the neural mechanism underlying the efficacy of cerebellar stimulation 
is unknown. Electrical stimulation of lateral cerebellar nuclei (LCN; analogous to the 
dentate nuclei in humans) in animal models indicates that cerebellar modulation of 
dopamine release in frontal networks may be one possible mechanism.14 However, it is 
unclear how cerebellar circuits interact with frontal networks and influence cognitive 
processing.
To investigate this issue, we studied cerebellar-frontal interactions in rodent models and in 
patients with schizophrenia during an elementary cognitive task: interval timing. This task 
requires working memory for temporal rules, attention to the passage of time and planning 
when to move. In general, these processes are disrupted in patients with schizophrenia, and 
timing is specifically and reliably disrupted in patients as well as first-degree relatives, in 
addition to several animal models of schizophrenia.15–17 Thus, interval timing is particularly 
well suited for studying cognition in schizophrenia because it is disrupted in patients with 
schizophrenia and in rodent models and involves both cerebellar networks and the MFC.
16,18–20
This prefrontal region is specifically dysfunctional in schizophrenia, has anatomical and 
functional homologies with rodent MFC1,21 and involves common patterns of neuronal 
activity in humans and rodents during timing tasks.22,23 Recent work from our group has 
shown that single MFC neurons are involved in temporal processing during interval timing.
20,22,24 The MFC also exerts top-down control over neural activity in other brain areas to 
promote goal-oriented behavior.25,26 For instance, we have found that the MFC can promote 
neuronal activity related to waiting or to adaptive control in downstream brain areas such as 
motor cortex.23,27 These data imply that disruptions in MFC might have far-reaching 
behavioral consequences. We have also found that disrupting MFC D1-type dopamine 
receptors, which have been implicated in schizophrenia,28,29 specifically impairs temporal 
processing by MFC neuronal ensembles. Because the cerebellum can be involved in 
temporal processing, and because cerebellar projections may influence frontal networks,10 
we explored how LCN stimulation influenced MFC networks during interval timing. We 
tested the specific hypothesis that stimulation of LCN projections to the thalamus can 
compensate for impaired MFC temporal processing during interval timing.
Here, we report that patients with schizophrenia also had attenuated MFC delta rhythms. We 
recorded from MFC and LCN neuronal ensembles during interval timing in rodents and 
found that MFC and LCN neurons had spectral interactions at delta frequencies. Finally, we 
found that delta-frequency optogenetic stimulation of LCN projections in the thalamus can 
compensate for MFC dysfunction in rodent models. These results illustrate how cerebellar 
projections can refine timing-related activity in medial frontal brain networks, which might 
help us understand cerebellar contributions to cognitive processing.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Humans
The electroencephalography (EEG) arm of this study included nine patients with 
schizophrenia recruited from the Iowa Longitudinal Database and nine sex-, education- and 
age-matched controls recruited from the University of Iowa Department of Neurology’s 
Cognitive Neuroscience Registry for Normative Data (Table 1 for patient data). Written 
informed consent was obtained from every subject and all research protocols were approved 
by the University of Iowa Human Subjects Review Board.
Human interval timing task
Interval timing was investigated in humans with and without schizophrenia (see 
Supplementary Methods and Figure 1a).22 The interval timing task consisted of four blocks 
of 40 trials (160 trials in total). Trials were presented in pseudorandom order. All trials 
began when a numerical cue stimulus appeared on the center of the screen indicating the 
temporal interval the participants were instructed to estimate (3 or 12–3 s trials were 
excluded in this study). Participants made responses by pressing the space bar on a keyboard 
using their dominant hand when they estimated the temporal interval had elapsed. 
Participants received feedback about their response time at the end of each trial. There was a 
3–6 s interval between response and feedback. After feedback, participants moved to the 
next trial by pressing the space bar. The task was self-paced and the participants were asked 
not to count in their head during the task. Participants performed four practice trials before 
the real task. The interval timing task consisted of 160 trials with either a 3 or 12 s interval; 
only data from the 12 s interval was included in this manuscript.
For both human and rodent interval timing, we quantified behavioral performance using 
metrics that we and others have used extensively.4,22,30,31 Briefly, we measured the 
efficiency as the number of responses at 12 s divided by the total number of responses; this 
number is closer to 1 if most responses are at 12 s. Second, we measured the curvature of 
time-response histograms by calculating the deviation of the cumulative sum from a straight 
line; curvature has been used for over 50 years to quantify interval timing behavior.30 
Curvature indices are higher with well-timed, more ‘curved’ time-response histograms. See 
Supplementary Methods and our prior work for further details.22
Neurophysioogical recording and time-frequency analysis
Twenty-one-lead 10/20 EEG recording and analysis was performed identically to prior 
work22,23 and are described at length in the Supplementary Methods. Bilateral mastoid re-
referencing was used. Detailed methods for time-frequency measures for human and rodent 
data have been published in our previous work and in the Supplementary Methods.4,22–24 
We used the KPSS (Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt and Shin) test to confirm that all EEG 
signals were stationary before subsequent analyses. Granger causality between rodent MFC 
and LCN was performed using the MGVC toolbox.32

 Rodents
A total of 27 male Long–Evans rats (aged 2 months; 200–225 g) were included in this study. 
There were four groups in this study (1) simultaneous left MFC and right LCN recordings in 
4 rodents, (2) pharmacological right LCN inactivation in 11 rodents, (3) optogenetic 
stimulation of the right LCN with left MFC dysfunction in 9 rodents and (4) left MFC 
recordings with LCN-VL (ventrolateral nucleus) stimulation in three rodents. Animals were 
trained in an interval timing task highly similar to the human version according operant 
techniques described in previous work and in the Supplementary Methods.20,22 The task had 
3 and 12 s intervals, with a uniformly varying 6–12 s intertrial interval; early responses 
occurring before interval end were not reinforced. Surgical procedures, neurophysiological 
recordings and focal drug infusions were performed according to procedures described 
previously.20,24,33 The coordinates for left medial frontal implants were AP: +3.2; ML: 
± 1.2; DV: − 3.5 at 12 °C in the lateral plane; for left VL: AP: − 2.3; ML: ± 1.8; DV: − 5.4; 
for right LCN AP: − 10.8; ML: ± 3.6; DV: − 6.2. LCN-VL projections were optogenetically 
stimulated during interval timing tasks using 473 nm light delivered at 10 mW power on 
50% of trials. See the Supplementary Methods for further details.20,22 Animals were 
transcardially perfused at the completion of experiments.
RESULTS
MFC delta activity and interval timing in humans and rodents We studied the dynamics of 
LCN-MFC activity using an interval timing task. During this task, participants estimate an 
interval of several seconds as instructed by a cue (Figure 1a). We quantified interval timing 
performance in two ways. First, we calculated the efficiency of responses by calculating the 
fraction of responses between 11 and 12 s divided by the overall number of responses. As 
efficiency is closer to 1, the fraction of responses at 12 s is greater, indicating that 
participants guide their actions in time more accurately.24 Second, we calculated the 
‘curvature’ of time-response histograms by measuring the deviation from the cumulative 
distribution of a straight line.4,22,30 This metric is 0 with a flat time-response curve during 
the interval and is closer to 1 when more responses are at 12 s and time-response histograms 
are more curved. Patients with schizophrenia were impaired on the interval timing task and 
estimated the end of the interval earlier relative to demographically matched controls (Table 
1 and Figure 1b).34,35 By these metrics patients with schizophrenia had impaired interval 
timing (Figure 1c; efficiency P<0.01, power = 0.99; curvature P<0.01, power = 0.98; data 
from nine patients and nine controls; statistics in Table 2; raw data in Supplementary Figure 
S1).30 Our group has shown that bursts of MFC delta (1–4 Hz) and theta (5–8 Hz) activity 
that are triggered by the instructional cue during interval timing tasks can be measured by 
scalp EEG from electrode Cz (black arrow; Figure 1d).22,23 In patients with schizophrenia, 
MFC delta activity at Cz was attenuated (Figure 1e; P<0.05, power = 0.96; Supplementary 
Figures S2 and S3).
Interactions between LCN and medial frontal neurons
The cerebellum has been shown to be involved in subsecond timing36 and in higher 
cognitive processes such as working memory.7 To study cerebellar contributions to timing 
over an interval of several seconds, we focally inactivated LCN using muscimol. We trained

 11 rodents to perform an interval timing task using lever presses motivated by liquid rewards 
(Figure 1a and Supplementary Video S1). After animals were well trained, we unilaterally 
inactivated the right LCN via focal infusions of muscimol, a GABAA agonist (Figure 2a).20 
Rodents with LCN inactivated tended to have impaired interval timing performance 
compared with control sessions with saline focally infused into the LCN (Figure 2b; 
efficiency: P<0.01; curvature trended P<0.09; data from 11 rodents). This result indicates 
that the LCN is involved in efficient suprasecond as well as subsecond interval timing.
To identify how LCN neurons might influence MFC networks, we recorded neural activity 
simultaneously in the left MFC and right LCN while animals performed the interval timing 
task (note that LCN projections decussate in the midbrain).37,38 We recorded 84 MFC and 
106 LCN neurons simultaneously in four rodents (Figure 2c). Work by our group and others 
have demonstrated that time-related ramping activity is a prominent feature of MFC 
neuronal activity.20,39–41 Our recordings indicate that LCN neuronal ensembles also had 
prominent ramping activity (Figures 2d and e) identified by data-driven techniques such as 
principal component analysis (ramping is PC1; Figure 2f and Supplementary Figure S4). 
MFC and LCN ensembles had similar projections for PCs 1–3 (Figure 2f). Finally, 
regression identified a similar fraction of neurons with significant linear and quadratic fits in 
the LCN and MFC (Supplementary Figure S5). The average slope for MFC neurons was 
0.15 ± 0.05 spikes per s2, which was similar to the slope for the LCN (0.13 ± 0.03 spikes per 
s2).
These data indicate that despite the fact that LCN and MFC neuronal ensembles are not 
directly connected,10,42,43 they had similar patterns of activity during interval timing that 
could not be easily differentiated. When neuronal activity was aligned to responses, activity 
in MFC and LCN could correlate with when responses occurred in the interval (12% of 
MFC neurons and 10% of LCN neurons; data from ± 0.5 s around lever press); however, as 
we were focused on cue-triggered delta activity and cue-triggered neural activity (Figure 1), 
we did not further analyze-response-related activity. Taken together, these data indicate that 
LCN neurons are involved in temporal processing on a scale of several seconds.
Because we recorded in both LCN and MFC simultaneously, we were able to look at 
interactions between neuronal ensembles in each area. Consistent with prior anatomical 
evidence,10,42,43 we could not find consistent evidence of fast relationships between LCN 
and MFC via techniques such as cross-correlation. However, on a trial-by-trial basis LCN 
and MFC average firing rates had strong correlations (example: Figure 3a; analysis restricted 
to 12 s trials only). Surprisingly, across 2316 MFC/LCN pairs in four animals, ~ 25% had 
functionally significant interactions (compared with trial-shuffled data; 116 pairs in shuffled 
data; X2 = 343, P<0.05). To examine the temporal evolution of these interactions, we 
analyzed joint-peristimulus time histograms (JPSTHs),44 which examine the evolution of 
firing rate correlations over time (Figure 3b). We found more LCN-MFC JPSTH interactions 
at relatively large bins (1 s bins: 293/2316, or 13%) compared with smaller bins (0.1 s bins: 
207 of 2316; X2 = 6.9, P<0.009; both more than in shuffled data). The average pattern of 
JPSTH interactions increased later in the interval (Figure 3c). In support of this temporal 
profile, we found stronger trial-by-trial correlations for 4–12 s than for 0–4 s (analysis 
identical to Figure 3a, except with 4 s bins; 265 interactions from 0 to 4 s vs 332 from 4 to 8

 s and 342 from 8 to 12 s; X2 = 13.0 P<0.001). These paired recordings in both areas indicate 
that despite having no evidence of coherence, MFC and LCN neurons had significant time-
varying functional relationships during interval timing, with more interactions later in the 
interval.
To examine the spectral features of LCN-MFC interactions, we examined coherence among 
single neurons and local field potentials.45 Consistent with lack of fast interactions between 
MFC and LCN, we observed no spike-spike coherence between MFC and LCN neurons. 
However, for LCN neurons that had significant trial-by-trial correlations with MFC neurons, 
we found delta band cross-area spike-field coherence between LCN neurons and MFC field 
potentials (Figure 3d). This cross-area spike-field coherence was not present for correlated 
MFC neurons and LCN fields nor was it found for neurons without correlations. To examine 
the spectral features of this causality in detail, we used Granger causality (Supplementary 
Figure S7). Analyses of differential directional connectivity revealed LCN fields had a 
significant causal relationship to MFC in the delta frequency (1–4 Hz; P<0.000006). 
Conversely, MFC LFPs had a significant causal relationship to LCN LFPs in the beta range 
(12–30 Hz; Figure 3e; P<10−13). This reciprocal connectivity is supported by work by Kelly 
and Strick.46 Prior work from our group and others has suggested that activity in the delta-
range couples neurons across frontal cortex in service of cognitive control.23,47 Cross-area 
LCN-MFC coherence could provide insight into how cerebellar circuits might influence 
cortical processing and leads to the hypothesis that LCN delta-range activity can modulate 
MFC neurons.
Cerebellar projections and medial frontal activity
Our results thus far suggest that LCN projections might have the potential to influence MFC 
activity. Because the MFC is dysfunctional in schizophrenia,1 we were interested to see if 
manipulations of cerebellar projections can compensate for MFC dysfunction. To model 
aspects of schizophrenia-related MFC dysfunction, we locally blocked MFC D1DRs using 
SCH23390.1,2,28,29 Patients with schizo phrenia have abnormalities in frontal D1DRs, and 
blocking these receptors has been used to model aspects of prefrontal dysfunction in 
schizophrenia.2,28,29 Although there are many models of schizophrenia, abnormal frontal D1 
signaling reliably produces deficits in interval timing behavior, disrupts temporal processing 
by single MFC neurons and attenuates MFC delta activity (Supplementary Figure S8).
20,24,38,48
In animals with MFC D1DR dysfunction, we optogenetically stimulated LCN projections to 
the thalamus. We stimulated synaptic terminals of LCN neurons in the VL expressing 
channelrhodopsin2 (Figure 4a, Supplementary Figures S8 and S9). Strikingly, optogenetic 
stimulation of LCN-VL projections at 2 Hz, but not 4, 10 or 20 Hz, rescued behavioral 
deficits induced by MFC D1DR blockade (efficiency P<0.04; curvature P<0.03 in 9 rodents; 
power = 0.998; Figure 4b, Supplementary Videos S2 and S3). In line with prior work on 
LCN, there was no clear effect of optogenetic LCN-VL terminal stimulation on lever 
pressing, rewards or open-field activity (Supplementary Figure S10).49 There was no effect 
in sessions without MFC D1 blockade or in separate control animals with AAV-mCherry

 (Supplementary Figures S11 and S12). These data intimate that increasing activity of the 
LCN can compensate for D1DR-dependent MFC deficits in the temporal control of action.
If LCN stimulation improves behavior, then it should rectify temporal processing in the 
MFC that is disrupted with MFC D1DR blockade.20 To test this idea, we recorded MFC 
neuronal ensembles after focally infusing SCH23390 into the MFC and optogenetically 
stimulating LCN projections in the thalamus (Figure 4c). In 26 MFC neurons from three 
animals, 2 Hz stimulation of LCN-VL terminals increased ramping activity in individual 
neurons by increasing the firing rate for the first 3 s of the interval (Figure 4c; P<0.05). More 
MFC neurons were fit by linear regression on stimulation trials compared with non-
stimulation trials (26% vs 4%; P<0.04). Both patients with schizophrenia and rodent models 
of MFC dysfunction have attenuated delta activity (Figures 1d, e and 4d).20,33 In these 
animals, 2 Hz LCN-VL stimulation increased MFC delta activity, restoring delta activity to 
MFC-saline levels (P<0.04; Figures 4d and e). Two hertz LCN-VL also trended to increase 
the number of MFC neurons with cue-triggered delta spike-field coherence, which our 
previous work has shown depends on MFC D1DRs (2 of 17 MFC neurons had significant 
cue-triggered delta spike-field coherence in MFC D1 blockade sessions, vs 7 MFC neurons 
with 2 Hz LCN-VL stimulation; X2 = 3.8; P = 0.05). These data indicate that 2 Hz 
stimulation of LCN-VL projections could rescue both behavioral deficits and MFC neuronal 
dysfunction caused by D1DR blockade, lending support to the idea that the cerebellar 
circuits can compensate for dysfunctional MFC activity.
DISCUSSION
We tested if cerebellar stimulation could normalize dysfunctional frontal networks and 
report three main findings: (1) patients with schizophrenia had attenuated MFC delta activity 
during interval timing and compromised projections from the cerebellum to the MFC, (2) 
MFC and LCN neuronal ensembles had shared temporal processing and extensive 
interactions, particularly at delta frequencies and (3) specifically stimulating LCN-VL 
projections could recover both behavioral performance and neuronal activity associated with 
elementary cognitive operations. Our results show that cerebellar and MFC networks interact 
at delta frequencies, providing evidence that cerebellar circuits can contribute to MFC 
cognitive processing, particularly when the MFC is not functioning optimally. This idea 
could be helpful in developing and optimizing treatments that target cerebellar circuits to 
improve MFC function in human diseases such as schizophrenia.4
The cerebellum is consistently active in cognitive tasks;7,18 however, patients with cerebellar 
lesions do not consistently have cognitive deficits.50 Cerebellar processing may be crucial in 
particular contexts, such as learning or compensating for cortical dysfunction.4 Thus, 
cerebellar circuits may be particularly well suited to therapeutic applications that seek to 
normalize cortical function. Our findings suggest a previously unappreciated role for the 
cerebellum in temporal processing on the scale of seconds, and indicate that cerebellar 
output nuclei have similar patterns of cognitive processing with the MFC. To our knowledge, 
our study is the first to probe neuronal activity in both the MFC and LCN during a cognitive 
task, and provides insight into cerebellar-frontal interactions during cognitive processing. 
Our working model is that LCN neurons provide temporal information to MFC neurons in

 the form of a ramping signal, and that this spiking activity arrives in-phase with 1–4 Hz delta 
MFC rhythms that engage temporal processing in the frontal cortex.20,24 We observe that 
with MFC D1 blockade these MFC delta rhythms are attenuated; however, we find that 
stimulating LCN synaptic terminals at delta frequencies increases MFC delta power and 
temporal processing, possibly by boosting corticothalamic spiking in-phase with MFC delta 
rhythms. Future work will elucidate precisely how LCN-VL input influences MFC spiking 
activity, as it could occur via a direct corticothalamic projection or an indirect projection to 
the VTA, striatum or other brain network.42 Extending this work to other tasks involving 
working memory, attention, planning and reasoning will further help define the role of the 
cerebellum in cognition.
Low-frequency stimulation of cerebellar networks has been partially effective at relieving 
some symptoms in treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients.12,13 In addition, cerebellar 
vermal transcranial magnetic stimulation can produce downstream changes in neuronal 
activity in the frontal cortex.51 Our data suggest that the cerebellar contribution to MFC 
activity is frequency-specific and that delta-range stimulation may be uniquely effective in 
modulating cognitive processing. Delta-range activity in MFC is coherent with single neuron 
activity; we found that LCN neurons were phase-locked with low-frequency MFC rhythms, 
and LCN field potentials causally predict MFC delta activity. More broadly, delta-range 
activity is found across diverse brain networks and appears to represent the need for 
cognitive control.47,52,53 Stimulating LCN projections in the thalamus might boost these 
cognitive control signals and counteract MFC dysfunction induced by disrupting cortical 
dopamine signaling.
Here we study cerebellar-frontal interactions in a highly limited model of aspects of frontal 
dysfunction in rodent models based on disrupting MFC D1DRs. This model has some 
clinical relevance and consistently affects interval timing as well as MFC neurons, and thus 
affords a unique opportunity to map this circuit in detail.20,24,28,29,48 There are many other 
animal models with relevance for schizophrenia, but mapping cerebellar-frontal interactions 
in these models will require extensive behavioral and neurophysiological characterization of 
MFC and LCN neurons before determining how best to intervene in these models. However, 
these efforts will likely generate a detailed understanding of the scope of cerebellar-frontal 
interactions, which could inform future translational efforts targeting the cerebellum for 
patients with schizophrenia.4

 Figure 1. 
Medial frontal delta activity is attenuated in patients with schizophrenia and rodent models 
during interval timing. (a) We study elementary cognitive processing using an interval 
timing task, in which participants must estimate an interval of time by making a motor 
response. (b) Patients with schizophrenia (orange, n = 9) have broader estimates of the 12 s 
interval than demographically matched controls (blue, n = 9). (c) Patients with schizophrenia 
have flatter time-response histograms (curvature) and are less efficient during interval 
timing. (d) electroencephalography (EEG) activity from mid-frontal electrode Cz indicated 
that controls had prominent bursts of delta activity triggered by the instructional cue (black 
arrow). (e) Patients with schizophrenia had attenuated delta activity (1–4 Hz). Other bands, 
such as theta activity (5–8 Hz), were not significantly changed. All data are presented as 
mean ± s.e.m. Asterisks indicate significance at P<0.05. Also see Supplementary Figures S1 
and S2.

 Figure 2. 
Lateral cerebellar nuclei (LCN) and medial frontal cortex (MFC) neurons are involved in 
temporal processing. (a) Cannula locations for focal infusions into LCN are illustrated with 
red dots on the right, while an individual example is shown on the left (note this image is 
mirrored as all cerebellar manipulations were on the right). (b) Inactivating LCN using 
muscimol (red) significantly impaired interval timing efficiency compared with control 
sessions (while curvature trended significant), with saline infused into the LCN (blue; n=11). 
(c) Simultaneous neural recordings from the left MFC (green, L—locations for each animal 
indicated by dots on schematic) and the right LCN (blue, R) in four rats during interval 
timing revealed (d) robust time-related ramping—that is, neural activity that consistently 
increased/decreased activity over the interval. Perievent rasters are sorted with respect to 
mean response time, with trials with a short mean response time on the bottom and trials

 with a longer mean response time on top. To the right of the rasters are the mean response 
times that correspond to each trial. Single neurons were isolated based on waveform (inset) 
and interspike intervals (green—MFC; blue—LCN). (e) Heatmaps of perievent time 
histograms revealed that time-related ramping was a ubiquitous feature of MFC and LCN 
ensembles (84 MFCs and 106 LCN neurons recorded simultaneously in four animals). Color 
scale is at bottom right. Neurons are sorted based on PC1 from (f) principal component 
analysis, a data-driven technique that identified time-related ramping as the first principal 
component in both MFCs and LCNs. There were no consistent differences between MFC 
and LCN neuronal ensembles for PCs 1–3; see Supplementary Figure S4 for scree plot of 
variance). All data from 84 MFC neurons and 106 LCN neurons in four rodents. Asterisk 
indicates significance at P<0.05 via t-test, displayed as mean ±s.e.m.

Interactions between lateral cerebellar nuclei (LCN) and medial frontal cortex (MFC). (a) 
Single MFC neurons (green) could have firing rate correlations with LCN neurons (blue) 
over trials; r = − 0.38; P<0.001. Rasters are sorted by mean response time and response 
times shown in teal for both simultaneously recorded neurons, as in Figure 2d. (b) To 
examine the evolution of these correlations during the interval, we turned to joint-
peristimulus time histogram (JPSTH), in which the dynamics of correlations can be 
analyzed. For this representative pair of neurons, JPSTH revealed increased correlations 
later in the interval. (c) This pattern was consistent across all possible combinations of LCN-
MFC neurons (blue-green). Data from 2316 pairs from 84 MFC and 106 LCN neurons in 
four animals. (d) Cross-area spike-field coherence revealed phase-locked activity at delta 
frequencies only for MFC LFPs with LCN neurons with significant trial-by-trial 
correlations. No other patterns of cross-regional spike-field coherence for LCN fields or for 
uncorrelated neurons were observed. (e) Granger causality (teal) indicates that LCN activity

 consistently led delta MFC activity in the delta band between 1 and 4 Hz (in nine LFPs from 
each area in three animals) in comparison with time-shuffled data (gray); notably, MFC led 
LCN activity in the beta band between 12 and 30 Hz. All data from 2316 MFC-LCN pairs in 
four rodents. Asterisk indicates significance at P<0.05 via analysis of variance (ANOVA).

Stimulation of cerebellar projections can compensate for frontal dysfunction. We modeled 
aspects of frontal dysfunction in schizophrenia by pharmacologically disrupting medial 
frontal cortex (MFC) D1 dopamine receptors with SCH23390. (a) Histological analyses 
revealed electrode infusion cannula ensemble placement in the MFC (gray), optical cannula 
in the ventrolateral thalamus (VL, blue) and channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) infusion/cannula 
placement in the lateral cerebellar nuclei (LCN) for individual animals as represented by 
each dot. Stimulating LCN-VL projections at 2 Hz could rescue behavioral deficits caused 
by MFC SCH23390 (lower plot in a; MFC SCH23390: gray— LCN-VL stimulation: green; 
ticks are individual lever presses from the entire experiment). (b) Group data from eight 
rodents showed impaired behavior with MFC SCH23390 and behavioral rescue with 2 Hz 
stimulation of LCN-VL projections. (c) During interval timing, MFC neurons have time-
related ramping, which is decreased with MFC SCH23390 (gray). For this neuron, with 
LCN-VL 2 Hz stimulation, ramping increased (green); each blue tick is a 473 nm laser 
pulse. With LCN-VL 2 Hz stimulation, ramping activity increased as measured by average 
activity or by linear regression; MFC-saline without stimulation is labeled in blue. Data from 
26 MFC neurons in three rodents; asterisk indicates significance at P<0.05 via χ2 test. (d) 
Similar to humans, rodents have a burst of delta/theta activity as shown by time-frequency 
analyses, which is decreased in animals with MFC D1DR blockade (gray—MFC
