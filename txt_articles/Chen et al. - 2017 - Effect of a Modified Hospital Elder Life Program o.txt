IMPORTANCE Older patients undergoing abdominal surgery commonly experience
preventable delirium, which extends their hospital length of stay (LOS).
OBJECTIVE To examine whether a modified Hospital Elder Life Program (mHELP) reduces
incident delirium and LOS in older patients undergoing abdominal surgery.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cluster randomized clinical trial of 577 eligible
patients enrolled 377 older patients (�65 years of age) undergoing gastrectomy,
pancreaticoduodenectomy, and colectomy at a 2000-bed urban medical center in Taipei,
Taiwan, from August 1, 2009, through October 31, 2012. Consecutive older patients
scheduled for elective abdominal surgery with expected LOS longer than 6 days were
enrolled, with a recruitment rate of 65.3%. Participants were cluster randomized by room
to receive the mHELP or usual care.
INTERVENTIONS The intervention (implemented by an mHELP nurse) consisted of 3
protocols administered daily: orienting communication, oral and nutritional assistance,
and early mobilization. Intervention group participants received all 3 mHELP protocols
postoperatively, in addition to usual care, as soon as they arrived in the inpatient ward and
until hospital discharge. Adherence to protocols was tracked daily.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Presence of delirium was assessed daily by 2 trained nurses
who were masked to intervention status by using the Confusion Assessment Method. Data
on LOS were abstracted from the medical record.
RESULTS Of 577 eligible patients, 377 (65.3%) were enrolled and randomly assigned to the
mHELP (n = 197; mean [SD] age, 74.3 [5.8] years; 111 [56.4%] male) or control (n = 180;
mean [SD] age, 74.8 [6.0] years; 103 [57.2%] male) group. Postoperative delirium occurred
in 13 of 196 (6.6%) mHELP participants vs 27 of 179 (15.1%) control individuals, representing
a relative risk of 0.44 in the mHELP group (95% CI, 0.23–0.83; P = .008). Intervention group
participants received the mHELP for a median of 7 days (interquartile range, 6–10 days) and
had a shorter median LOS (12.0 days) than control participants (14.0 days) (P = .04).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE For older patients undergoing abdominal surgery who
received the mHELP, the odds of delirium were reduced by 56% and LOS was reduced by
2 days. Our findings support using the mHELP to advance postoperative care for older
patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.

atientsundergoingabdominalsurgeryoftendevelopde-
lirium, which greatly influences their postoperative
course of clinical recovery and length of hospital stay
(LOS).1-3 Delirium affects 13% to 50% of patients undergoing
noncardiac surgery,4 and the health care costs attributable to
delirium are more than $164 billion per year in the United
States.5,6 Older surgical patients (≥65 years of age) have a par-
ticularly high risk for developing delirium, with detrimental
effects on their recovery.6 Delirium has been associated with
alterations in cholinergic activity, inflammatory processes in-
duced by neural signaling, and excessive depth of anesthesia
and sedation.7,8 Delirium may also be precipitated by factors
such as infection, malnutrition, electrolyte and fluid imbal-
ances, anemia, and social isolation.4,9,10 Nevertheless, 30% to
40% of cases of delirium are preventable11; thus, implement-
ing effective interventions to prevent incident delirium and re-
duce LOS is a clinical priority.
We hypothesized that delirium and LOS would be re-
duced by protocols such as orienting communication (ie, ori-
entation and engaged conversation), oral and nutritional
assistance (ie, brushing teeth, oral-facial exercise, and post-
operativedietaryeducation),andearlymobilization.12-14These
protocols, initially developed in 2008, were modified from the
HospitalElderLifeProgram(HELP),whichiscost-effectiveand
has been disseminated widely.15-17 Our unique innovation was
to select 3 core protocols and allow them to be delivered dur-
ing daily care by trained nursing staff for feasibility and
scalability.12 For this cluster randomized clinical trial (RCT), we
evaluated the effects of the modified Hospital Elder Life Pro-
gram (mHELP) on delirium incidence and LOS in a sample of
older patients (≥65 years of age) undergoing major elective ab-
dominal surgery, primarily for resection of malignant tu-
mors. As a subgroup analysis, effects were stratified by type
of abdominal surgery.
Methods
Although cluster randomization is less efficient than indi-
vidual randomization because outcomes can be correlated be-
tween clusters (often reflected as the intraclass correlation
[ICC]),18 this design minimizes contamination among partici-
pants in different groups by ensuring that all participants in
one room belong to the same group. Physicians and hospital
staff (surgeons, residents, and nurses) at the study site were
awareofapendingnursinginterventionstudybutweremasked
to study hypothesis, group allocation, and specific protocols
ofmHELP.Moreover,outcomeassessorsweremaskedtogroup
assignment, and room assignments were rerandomized
every 20 patients to minimize potential unmasking of the
randomization scheme. The trial protocol can be found in
Supplement 1. This cluster RCT was approved by the Re-
search Ethics Review Committee at the National Taiwan Uni-
versity Hospital and registered at clinicaltrials.gov.
Patient Selection
Consecutive older patients (≥65 years of age) admitted to two
36-bed gastrointestinal wards of a 2000-bed urban medical
center in Taipei, Taiwan, were screened for enrollment from
August 1, 2009, through October 31, 2012. Patients were en-
rolled if they met 2 criteria: scheduled for elective abdominal
surgeryandexpectedLOSlongerthan6days.Participantswere
cluster randomized to groups with an allocation ratio of 1:1
based on a computer-generated list. Cluster randomization by
room was necessary because most patient units in Taiwan are
double- or triple-occupancy rooms, threatening cross-
contamination if patients were individually randomized. This
randomization approach was facilitated by both gastrointes-
tinal wards having the same layout: 6 single-occupancy rooms
(3 each randomly assigned to the control and mHELP groups),
9 double-occupancy rooms (4 randomly assigned to the
control group and 5 to the mHELP group), and 4 triple-
occupancy rooms (2 randomly assigned to each group)
(Figure1).Participantsinthe38roomsformed318clustersdur-
ing the 3-year study period. Written informed consent was ob-

Key Points
Question Does a modified Hospital Elder Life Program reduce
incident delirium and hospital length of stay in patients
undergoing abdominal surgery?
Findings In this cluster randomized clinical trial of 377 older
patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery, postoperative
delirium occurred in fewer patients in the intervention group than
in the control group. Hospital length of stay was also significantly
shorter in the intervention group.
Meaning The modified Hospital Elder Life Program strongly
may benefit older patients undergoing abdominal surgery, with
significant reduction of delirium incidence and hospital length
of stay.

 Intervention and Usual Care
The intervention (mHELP) was implemented by a trained
mHELP nurse (registered nurse who had 2 years of medical-
surgical experience and who was trained on site for 1 month
before the intervention start)12 who did not assess any out-
comes. The intervention consisted of the daily hospital-
based mHELP comprising 3 core nursing protocols: orienting
communication, oral and nutritional assistance, and early mo-
bilization (eAppendix 1 in Supplement 2).12 In addition to usual
perioperative care (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 2), partici-
pants received all 3 mHELP protocols postoperatively as soon
as they arrived in the inpatient ward, immediately after in-
terim intensive care stays, and until hospital discharge. All pro-
tocols were tracked daily with adherence rated on a Likert-
type scale from 0 (no adherence) to 3 (full implementation and
adherence).
Usual care consisted of standard hospital care provided by
surgeons,residents,nurses,andphysicaltherapists(asneeded)
in the general surgery wards. All participants were encour-
aged to ambulate and did so as tolerated. The mHELP nurses
did not provide services to participants assigned to the con-
trol group. However, the same attending physicians provided
care to participants in the mHELP and control groups.
Study Data
Two outcome assessors specially trained for delirium assess-
ment collected outcome data from Monday through Satur-
day. Presence of delirium was assessed by the Confusion As-
sessment Method19 based on a brief daily cognitive screen and
interview to rate 4 core delirium symptoms. Participants were
considered to have delirium if they had the first (acute onset
and fluctuating course) and second (inattention) core symp-
toms and the third (altered consciousness) or fourth (disorga-
nized thinking) symptom. The Confusion Assessment Method
is a widely used, standardized method for identifying de-
lirium that has a sensitivity of 94% (95% CI, 91%-97%) and a
specificity of 89% (95% CI, 85%-94%) compared with clinical
expert ratings and an interrater reliability of 0.70 to 1.00.20
Changes in mental status were also solicited from family mem-
bers or nurses. The outcome assessors did not communicate
with the mHELP nurses and were masked to participants’in-
tervention status.
Patient characteristics obtained from in-person inter-
views included age, sex, and educational level. Baseline clini-
cal factors included presurgical Charlson comorbidity index
(higherscoresindicategreatermortalityrisk),21presurgicalcog-
nitive status measured using the Mini-Mental State Examina-
tion (score range, 0-30; 30 indicates no impairment),22 func-
tional status measured using the Barthel Index (score range,
0-100; 100 indicates total independence),23 nutritional sta-
tus measured using the Mini-Nutritional Assessment (score
range, 0-30; 30 indicates normal status),24 and depressive sta-
tus measured using the Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form
(scorerange,0-15;15indicatesdepression).25Otherclinicaldata
abstracted from medical records included diagnosis (gastric
cancer, pancreatic or periampullary cancer, colorectal can-
cer, or other), malignant tumor (yes/no), tumor stage (0 to IV),
type of surgery (total or subtotal gastrectomy; right hemico-
lectomy; left hemicolectomy, lower anterior resection, or an-
terior resection; pancreaticoduodenectomy; or other), dura-
tion of surgery (minutes), laparoscopic surgery (yes/no),
intensive care unit (ICU) admission (yes/no), and length of ICU
stay (days). The LOS data were abstracted from the medical
record at discharge.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach. All
analyses were performed with SAS statistical software, ver-
sion 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc) and R software, version 3.2.1
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Sample character-
isticswerecomparedbytreatmentgroupatbaseline.Datawere
reported as number (percentage), mean (SD), or median (in-
terquartile range [IQR]) when not normally distributed.
AnimportantfeatureofclusterRCTsistheextentofwithin-
cluster correlation for end points. The ICC, defined as the ra-
tio of between-cluster variance to total variance, refers to the
proportion of variance attributed to the cluster level. The ICC
and its 95% CI were calculated for each outcome using the
ICCest function in the R software ICC, which adopted the vari-
ance components from a 1-way analysis of variance for the
calculation.26 Of note, all ICCs for each outcome (eAppendix
3 in Supplement 2) were not significantly different from 0 and
some were even less than 0, suggesting that the true ICCs are
small and adjustment for cluster effect is not indicated.27 We
thusanalyzedtreatmenteffectsusingstandardstatisticalmeth-
ods not accounting for within-cluster correlation. Kaplan-
Meier analysis and the log-rank test were further used to com-
pare the cumulative incidence of delirium, defined as the
probability that delirium would develop during hospitaliza-
tion, between study groups. All statistical tests were 2-tailed,
and P < .05 was considered to indicate statistical signifi-
cance. To correct for multiple comparisons, the significance
of the intervention effect for each of the 5 surgical types was
assessed at Bonferroni-corrected P = .01 (0.05/5).28
Results
Of 577 eligible patients, 377 (65.3%) were enrolled and ran-
domly assigned to the mHELP (n = 197; mean [SD] age, 74.3
[5.8] years; 111 [56.4%] male) or control (n = 180; mean [SD]
age, 74.8 [6.0] years; 103 [57.2%] male) group (Figure 1 and
Table 1).29 The mHELP and control groups did not differ sig-
nificantly in terms of any baseline characteristics, including
presurgical cognitive status or other functional measures. The
primary indication for surgery was malignant tumor (178
[90.4%] for the mHELP group vs 165 [91.7%] for the control
group; P = .64).
Intervention Adherence
Participants and family caregivers reported positive percep-
tions of the mHELP protocols. The median start time of the in-
tervention protocols was postoperative day 1 (IQR, 1-3 days),
with 120 of 196 participants (61.2%) starting by postoperative
day 1 and 173 participants (88.3%) receiving mHELP compo-
nents no later than postoperative day 3. The reason for the de-

 lay in the remaining 23 participants (11.7%) receiving mHELP
components later than postoperative day 3 was that their ICU
stay was prolonged beyond 3 days. Nevertheless, overall ad-
herence to the protocols was good; 166 participants (84.3%)
had mean scores of 2 or higher (range, 0-3), indicating mod-
erately good adherence. Mean adherence scores for orienting
communication and early mobilization were slightly higher
than for oral and nutritional assistance (2.6 and 2.5 vs 2.3). In
total, participants in the mHELP group received a median of 7
days (IQR, 6-10 days) of the mHELP protocols, and the mean
(SD)timespentwitheachparticipantpersessionwas34.1(16.0)
minutes (median, 30 minutes; IQR, 25-40 minutes). No ad-
verse events or unintended effects were reported as interven-
tion related in the mHELP group.
Effects on Delirium
During hospitalization, 40 cases (10.6%) of incident delirium
occurred in both groups. In the group that received mHELP,
delirium developed in 13 cases (6.6%), whereas the control
group had 27 cases (15.1%) (Table 2). These differences were
statistically significant with a relative risk of 0.44 for de-
lirium (95% CI, 0.23-0.83; P = .008), demonstrating a risk re-
duction of 56%. In absolute terms, the number of cases needed
to treat to prevent 1 case of delirium was 11.8. The mHELP also
had significant effects for cumulative incidence of delirium
(χ2 = 5.87, P = .02) (Figure 2). Stratified by surgical type, par-
ticipants who underwent total or subtotal gastrectomy and re-
ceived mHELP had reduced delirium (1 [2.3%] in the mHELP
group vs 8 [18.6%] in the control group; P = .03).

 Effects on LOS
The mHELP and control groups differed significantly in me-
dian LOS (12.0 vs 14.0 days; P = .04) (Table 2). Stratified by sur-
gical type, participants who underwent total or subtotal gas-
trectomy had significantly shorter LOS (12.0 vs 18.0 days;
P < .001)withmHELP.DelayedimplementationofmHELPcom-
ponents in 23 participants (11.7%) was attributable to a pro-
longed ICU stay of 3 days or longer. In this mHELP subgroup,
delirium incidence was lower than that in the control sub-
group (4 of 23 [17.4%] vs 6 of 20 [30.0%]), a difference that did
notreachsignificance(P = .47).Moreover,LOSdidnotdiffersig-
nificantlybetweenthesesubgroups(21.0vs21.0days;P = .80).
Discussion
The mHELP strongly benefitted older patients undergoing ab-
dominal surgery for resection of malignant tumor, with sig-
nificant reduction of delirium incidence by 56% and hospital
LOS by 2 days. As shown in Figure 2, development of de-
lirium is not only delayed but also reduced for patients who
received mHELP. Stratified by surgical type, patients who un-
derwent gastrectomy benefited more from mHELP, with a
6-day shorter LOS than in the control group (12.0 vs 18.0 days;
P < .001). This subgroup also experienced a trend toward re-
duceddeliriumincidence.Themechanismforthisgreaterben-
efit in patients undergoing gastrectomy is unclear, requiring
further research to understand factors that may magnify or
attenuate the mHELP effects and to define the effect of mHELP
in various surgical procedures.
ConsistentwithourRCTfindings,a14-studymeta-analysis17
found that multicomponent, nonpharmacologic interven-
tions including at least 2 to 6 components (ie, cognition, mo-
bilization, hydration, hearing, vision, and sleep-wake cycle)
in 4 randomized or matched trials (mostly medical inpa-
tients; one focusing on surgical patients) effectively reduced
incident delirium by 44% with a trend toward reducing LOS.
The mHELP targets similar components (orienting communi-
cation, oral and nutritional assistance, and early mobiliza-
tion) with a unique extension to brushing teeth and oral-
facial exercise to improve dry mouth and swallowing efficacy,
thusfacilitatingoralintake.Wepostulatedthatincreasingolder
patients’attention to and engagement with the postopera-
tive recovery environment,30 increasing their swallowing ef-
ficacy and nutritional and fluid repletion,23,26,31 and augment-
ing physical activity32,33 would prevent delirium and reduce
LOS. Future research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms
of the intervention effect; possible research areas include neu-

 ropsychological measures, such as executive functioning and
attention; physiology of swallowing efficacy; nutritional and
fluid parameters; or inflammatory markers.
We note that other delirium prevention approaches for
older hospitalized adults have included proactive geriatric
consultation,34 training family members,35,36 sustained
education,37-39 and single-component interventions, such as
bright light, music therapy, and use of software to detect medi-
cations that may cause delirium.40 Not all studies35,36,38,39,41
included surgical patients or documented efficacy in reduc-
ing delirium incidence. An important issue noted by research-
ers in most of these studies35,39,41 was that assuring adher-
ence to the interventions was a key factor for success and was
not always achievable across settings.41
Indeed, the 3 mHELP protocols might seem commonsen-
sical, yet the key to their effectiveness may lie in their consis-
tent daily application.42 In this study, we had a full-time–
equivalent trained mHELP nurse to consistently deliver all 3
protocols to 196 patients, spending approximately 30 min-
utes with each patient daily. Thus, with an additional 30 min-
utes of nursing time per older patient, mHELP reduced de-
lirium by 56% and shortened LOS by 2 days, which will greatly
reduce medical costs. By extrapolation, older patients in the
United States had 7.96 million surgical hospital stays in 2012,
withameancostof$11 600perstay.43Thus,mHELPcouldhave
prevented approximately 674 576 cases of delirium in the sur-
gical service in 2012, resulting in a Medicare cost savings of
approximately $10 000 per case44 or $6.7 billion for the year.4,5
By cutting 2 days from LOS (of 14 days in controls; a 14% re-
duction), implementation of mHELP could have saved $1624
per hospital stay or $12.9 billion per year in Medicare costs for
the hospital stay.
Limitations
Several caveats about this study are worthy of comment. First,
we did not adjust for the cluster effect because of very small
ICCs, indicating weak between-cluster correlations for each
outcome. To gain efficiency, future trials may use individual
randomization instead of cluster randomization. Second, with
a sample size of 377, post hoc analysis indicated that our study
was powered at 81% for delirium and 80% for LOS to detect
group differences as a whole but was underpowered for sub-
group analyses by surgical type. Third, 9 of 377 participants
(2.4% attrition rate, including 3 deaths and 6 dropouts) had
missing outcome values, which might have biased the study
findings. However, this bias was likely minimized by attrition
rates not differing significantly between the intervention and
control groups (2.5% vs 2.2%). Fourth, participants from both
groups received care from the same surgeons and nurses; that
is, some participants in the control group may have received
mHELP components through crossover (contamination) ef-
fects. However, the effect of this contamination would have
underestimated the mHELP effects. Fifth, we did not collect
data on postoperative complications, which are important risk
factors for delirium and might have also been affected by
mHELP and contributed to the study findings. Sixth, our trial
was conducted without an enhanced recovery after surgery
(ERAS) program that involved epidural or regional anesthe-
sia, minimally invasive techniques, fluid and pain manage-
ment, and aggressive postoperative rehabilitation.45 Al-
thoughthisomissionmaylimitgeneralizabilitytocentersusing
ERAS, mHELP may still present important advantages. For
medical centers unable to initiate a full ERAS program, mHELP
may be considered to be a useful starting point to advance care
for vulnerable older patients. Moreover, for centers with ERAS
already implemented, mHELP provides feasible, structured,
postoperative care protocols that target cognition, nutrition,
and ambulation to augment the ERAS program and enhance
recovery.
Conclusions
Delirium, which is recognized as the most common surgical
complication in older patients, has been associated with
increased morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospital
stays, higher medical costs, and greater likelihood of
institutionalization.6,46 Older patients undergoing major ab-
dominal surgery for resection of malignant tumor had mark-
edly reduced rates of incident delirium and shorter LOS when
they received mHELP, which included 3 nurse-administered
protocols: orienting communication, oral and nutritional as-
sistance, and early mobilization. The key to the effectiveness
of the 3 mHELP components is their consistent and daily ap-
plication, with high adherence rates.42 Medical centers that
want to advance postoperative care for older patients might
consider mHELP as a highly effective starting point for
delirium prevention.

Interventions to Reduce Postoperative Delirium
Aligning Surgical Care With Patients’Needs and Priorities
Pasithorn A. Suwanabol, MD; Daniel B. Hinshaw, MD
In this issue of JAMA Surgery, Chen and colleagues1 report a
cluster randomized clinical trial of a modified Hospital Elder
Life Program encompassing multicomponent nonpharmaco-
logic interventions to reduce postoperative delirium in older
adults undergoing major ab-
dominal surgery. The inter-
ventions include orienting
communications, oral and
nutritional assistance, and early mobilization in addition to
usualpostoperativecare,togetherrequiring30additionalmin-
utes of care per day yet significantly reducing the incidence
of postoperative delirium and length of hospital stay. The au-
thors report that these simple interventions with minimal risk
can have profound effects that are scalable and may be easily
incorporated into existing postoperative protocols.
Delirium affects 13% to 50% of surgical patients and is es-
timatedtocost$152billionperyearintheUnitedStates.2,3Post-
operative delirium is associated with increased length of hos-
pital stay, rates of nonhome discharge, and mortality rates.3
Furthermore, delirium can affect postoperative function and
long-term prognosis in addition to leading to a substantially
higher risk of persistent cognitive decline and the develop-
ment of dementia and depression.4 Cognitive impairments
affect the ability to care for oneself, restrict social function-
ing, and decrease decision-making capacity. Most recently,
Pusswald et al5 reported an association between self-
reported impairments in cognition and reduced health-
related quality of life. A significant focus has been made on
modifiable factors to improve postoperative outcomes in older
adults, yet few studies, at least in the general surgery litera-
ture, examine postoperative interventions to reduce the inci-
dence of delirium in this patient population.6
This study highlights not only a feasible and effective in-
tervention but also notably outcome measures that are most
important to patients. Delirium, subsequent cognitive de-
cline,andpotentialfordementiaaredistressingtopatientsand
families, leading to decreased or loss of functional ability
(including threatened loss of independent living), depressive
symptoms, and poorer quality of life. It is critical that we con-
tinuetoexaminetheselong-termoutcomesofsurgeryonolder
adults and find measures to reduce these burdensome ef-
fects. Hospital Elder Life Programs have been implemented at
more than 200 sites in the United States and worldwide, with
an overall reduction in postoperative delirium by 30%.7 How-
ever, this study and most available delirium intervention lit-
erature fail to address the surgical intensive care unit patient
population. Future studies in these settings are warranted,
which may further mitigate the incidence of delirium and its
sequelae. Nonetheless, interventions such as these not only
reduce health care cost but also improve patient quality of
life and address patient priorities that may not be measured
by typical surgical quality metrics, such as death and compli-
cations. The surgical community should take notice of this im-
portant work because it may serve as a cost-effective model
for achieving outcomes that are meaningful to surgeons and
their patients.
