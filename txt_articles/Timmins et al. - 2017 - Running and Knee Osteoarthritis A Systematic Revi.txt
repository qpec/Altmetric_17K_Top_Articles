Running and knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis 
1 
Abstract 
2 
Background 
3 
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic condition characterised by pain, impaired function and reduced 
4 
quality of life. A number of risk factors for knee OA have been identified such as obesity, occupation 
5 
and injury. The association between physical activity or particular sports such as running and knee 
6 
OA is less clear. Previous reviews, and the evidence which informs them, present contradictory or 
7 
inconclusive findings.  
8 
Purpose 
9 
This systematic review aimed to determine the association between running and the development 
10 
of knee OA. 
11 
Study Design 
12 
Systematic review and meta-analysis. 
13 
Method 
14 
Four electronic databases were searched, along with citations in eligible articles and reviews, and 
15 
the contents of recent journal issues. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts 
16 
using pre-specified eligibility criteria. Full-text articles were also independently assessed for 
17 
eligibility. Eligible studies were those in which running or running-related sports (e.g. triathlon or 
18 
orienteering) were assessed as a risk factor for the onset or progression of knee OA in adults. 
19 
Relevant outcomes included 1) diagnosis of knee OA, 2) radiographic markers of knee OA, 3) knee 
20 
joint surgery for OA, 4) knee pain or 5) knee-associated disability. Risk of bias was judged using the 
21 
Newcastle-Ottowa scale. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed with case-control studies 
22 
investigating arthroplasty. 
23

Results 
24 
After de-duplication, the search returned 1322 records. 153 full-text articles were assessed. 25 were 
25 
eligible, describing 15 studies: 11 cohort (6 retrospective) and 4 case-control studies. Findings of 
26 
studies with a diagnostic OA outcome were mixed. There were some radiographic differences 
27 
observed in runners, but only at baseline within some subgroups. Meta-analysis suggested a 
28 
protective effect of running against surgery due to OA: pooled OR 0.46 (95% CI 0.30, 0.71). The I2 
29 
was 0% (95% CI 0%, 73%). Evidence relating to symptomatic outcomes was sparse and inconclusive.  
30 
Conclusion 
31 
On this evidence, it is not possible to conclude the role of running in knee OA. Moderate to low 
32 
quality evidence suggests: no association with OA diagnosis, a positive association with OA diagnosis, 
33 
and a negative association with knee OA surgery. Conflicting results may reflect methodological 
34 
heterogeneity. More well-designed, prospective evidence is needed to clarify the contradictions.

What is known about the subject 
38 
The conclusions of previous reviews exploring the role of sport and physical activity in the 
39 
development of knee osteoarthritis are inconsistent. The knee joint structures may respond 
40 
differently to different types of physical activity, but it is unclear what the effect of running may be. 
41 
What this study adds to existing knowledge 
42 
This systematic review offers a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of the evidence surrounding 
43 
running and knee OA, incorporating a number of OA related markers and symptoms. Scant, low 
44 
quality prospective evidence suggests either no association or an increased risk of diagnosis. On the 
45 
  
3 
 
other hand, the first published meta-analysis of case-control evidence suggests a protective role of 
46 
running against knee replacement surgery.

Background 
49 
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic condition that is characterised by pain, impaired function and 
50 
reduced quality of life. In the US, estimates suggest almost 27 million adults have clinically diagnosed 
51 
OA30. An estimated 3.5 million people over the age of 50 in the UK currently have disabling OA 48. 
52 
The knee is one of the most commonly affected joints 31, with over 9 million people estimated to 
53 
have knee OA in the US30. Despite significant progress over recent decades, much remains unknown 
54 
regarding the aetiology of knee OA. A number of risk factors have been identified, such as obesity, 
55 
occupational activity level and joint injury 3. Other factors which have been demonstrated to 
56 
influence OA susceptibility include age, gender, genetics and ethnicity 17. The association between 
57 
physical activity or exercise and knee OA is less clear.  
58 
It has been postulated that OA develops following either excessive physiological loading on normal 
59 
joint structures, or normal loading on compromised structures (following injury, for example) 11. OA 
60 
is a mechanically driven condition41. How the individual knee structures respond to dynamic, cyclical 
61 
loading patterns during running (particularly over prolonged periods) is unclear. If the mechanical 
62 
loading stimulus of running helps elicit beneficial adaptation to the joints and surrounding 
63 
structures, it may have a protective effect. Conversely, if a joint’s tolerance to loading is exceeded as 
64 
a result of running, it could be a risk factor. The relationship is further complicated as running itself is 
65 
directly (and indirectly) associated with other risk factors such as joint injury and BMI 3, 49. There is 
66 
variation in the risk of knee joint injury across different sports and physical activities 22, 32. Therefore, 
67 
studying running independently from other sports may help to understand the relationship between 
68 
physical activity and OA risk. 
69 
A number of reviews have investigated the role of physical activity, or particular sports, in the 
70 
development of OA and have been inconclusive or contradictory 3, 8, 50, 51. One explanation for 
71 
discrepant conclusions may lie in the different methods used by studies to measure and classify 
72 
physical activity. 3 The review by Urquhart et al 50, for example, excluded studies investigating 
73 
  
5 
 
physical activities of daily living. In addition, the type of sporting activity may be relevant, if different 
74 
activities affect the knee joint structures in non-consistent ways 6. Some previous reviews reported 
75 
on the role of running in knee OA 8, 12, 43. However, one of these is now over 10 years old 43 whilst the 
76 
two more recent reviews were restricted in scope: one examining elite-level running only 12 and one 
77 
was limited by language (English only) and date (post 1990)8. The objective of this review is to 
78 
determine from the published literature what the role is of running in the development of knee OA. 
79 
 
80 
Methods 
81 
Recommendations by the Cochrane Collaboration 14 were adopted for this review. The protocol was 
82 
registered on PROSPERO database (reg. no. CRD42015024001)4. 
83 
Search strategy 
84 
Four electronic databases (MEDLINE via OvidSP, Embase via OvidSP, SPORTDiscus via EBSCOhost, 
85 
and PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database)) were searched (for search terms see online appendix 
86 
1). Searches were not limited by language or date. Database searches were supplemented by hand-
87 
searching the citations in identified reviews and eligible articles, as well as of the contents of 
88 
recent/in-press editions of four pre-specified relevant journals (AJSM, JAMA, Osteoarthritis and 
89 
Cartilage, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery). Searches took place from June to November 2015, and 
90 
results were imported and de-duplicated using EndNote X6. 
91 
Study selection 
92 
Two reviewers independently assessed each reference against pre-specified inclusion and exclusion 
93 
criteria (see protocol on PROSPERO) using a two-stage process: firstly, titles and abstracts, and, 
94 
secondly, full-text articles. Discrepancies were settled by discussion between reviewers or 
95 
consultation with a third author. Eligible studies were cohort, case-control studies or randomised 
96 
  
6 
 
trials which included adult samples, measured exposure to any form of running or jogging (including 
97 
running-related sports such as triathlon and orienteering), included a comparison group, and 
98 
assessed the following outcomes: 
99 
1. any definition of diagnosed knee OA and/or  
100 
2. radiographic/imaging markers of knee OA and/or  
101 
3. knee arthroplasty for OA and/or  
102 
4. knee pain and/or  
103 
5. disability specifically associated with the knee.  
104 
Excluded studies were those that reported outcomes not specific to the knee joints, and those in 
105 
which the time between exposure to running and the outcome was inadequate (a minimum of one 
106 
year). Retrospective cohorts, defined as cohorts in which prior running exposure was established at 
107 
recruitment, were eligible. Studies were also excluded where running exposure was combined with 
108 
other sports or activities, therefore running exposure could not be identified independently. This 
109 
review did not consider grey literature. More detailed eligibility criteria are available in the review 
110 
protocol. Studies were not excluded on the basis of language or date. Translators were sought for 
111 
non-English references. 
112 
Data extraction and synthesis 
113 
Data were extracted for each eligible article by a single reviewer, using a pre-piloted extraction form. 
114 
Data extraction was checked by a second reviewer. Where multiple publications were found for a 
115 
study, the most recent results for each outcome were extracted. Where a study included more than 
116 
one comparator, comparisons with community controls were prioritised (over, for example, 
117 
comparisons against athletes from other sports). 
118 
All eligible studies are included in a narrative synthesis, organised by outcome and study design. 
119 
Meta-analysis was considered for each eligible outcome; however, due to high levels of between-
120 
  
7 
 
study methodological heterogeneity and small numbers of studies for each outcome, meta-analysis 
121 
was appropriate for only one outcome: knee arthroplasty (case-control studies). Due to the 
122 
observational nature of case-control studies, a random-effects model was conducted in RevMan, 
123 
using the Mantel-Haenszel method of weighting 34. All rates entered were crude (unadjusted). 
124 
Missing data were not accounted for. Measurement effects are expressed as odds ratios (OR) with 
125 
95% confidence intervals (CI). Due to the small number of studies (n=3), subgroup or sensitivity 
126 
analyses (as pre-specified in the protocol) were not undertaken. The I2 statistic was used as a 
127 
measure of heterogeneity, with 95% confidence intervals using the non-central Chi2 approach 16. 
128 
Meta-analyses were performed using Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.3 46. 
129 
Risk of bias 
130 
The Newcastle Ottawa scale 53 was used to assess each eligible study for risk of bias. Two reviewers 
131 
independently assessed each study. Disagreements in ratings were resolved by consensus or on 
132 
consultation with a third reviewer. Studies were not excluded on the basis of risk of bias.  
133 
The possibility of publication bias cannot be excluded. Funnel plots were not attempted because 
134 
there were too few studies included the meta-analysis 45. 
135 
 
136 
RESULTS 
137 
The search results are shown in Figure 1, according to PRISMA guidelines 35. Following screening, 25 
138 
articles1 were identified as eligible, describing 15 studies. Study names were assigned comprising 
139 
first author and year of first publication (see Table 1). Year of (first) publication ranged from 1977 to 
140 
2010. Two studies were not published in English: one was Danish 7, one was German 15.

STUDY CHARACTERISTICS 
144 
Study characteristics are summarised in Table 1. The majority (n=11) were cohort studies, 6 of which 
145 
were retrospective 7, 15, 21, 36, 37, 44. The remaining 4 studies used a case-control design 20, 33, 42, 47. All of 
146 
the eligible studies were based in either European or USA populations.

Three studies, all investigating radiographic outcomes, identified fewer than 5 years running 
149 
exposure, and could be described as short-term 15, 36, 37. Three studies were long-term (exposure and 
150 
outcome separated by at least 25yr) 19, 21, 44, and four were medium-term (between 5 and 25 years’ 
151 
exposure) 5, 10, 25, 39. One study 7 did not report the study duration. 
152 
In the majority of the cohort studies (n=7), exposure to running was defined as membership of a club 
153 
or association or as having taken part in competition. One cohort was recruited from a broader 
154 
community, rather than via clubs or competition records 10. Several studies 15, 37, 38 did not describe 
155 
recruitment nor how the exposure was determined. 
156 
Sample sizes of cohorts ranged from 15 to 1279 (see Table 1) with seven of the 11 cohorts including 
157 
small (n≤100) samples. Five of the cohorts included both males and females, one included only 
158 
females 44, and five studies included only males. Mean age at outcome assessment ranged from 27.4 
159 
to around 69 years. All but 3 of the studies investigated running or jogging as the exposure. The 
160 
other 3 studies investigated orienteering or triathlon. No studies specifically reported on exposure to 
161 
short-distance running. 
162 
Five of the cohorts recruited only elite athletes (or ex-professional athletes). Non-runners were 
163 
recruited from a variety of sources: public military archives; the community; hospital radiology 
164 
departments; from within the cohort or from other studies. Two studies additionally compared 
165 
against ex-elite athletes from other sports23, 44. Two studies did not report how ‘non-runners’ were 
166 
defined, identified or recruited 37, 38. 
167 
Case control studies 
168 
Three of the case control studies based their case definition on hospital registries of knee 
169 
arthroplasty procedures: in Sweden 42, Finland 33 and the USA 20. The other case control study 47 was 
170 
based in Sweden and used listed diagnosis of knee OA from hospital registers to define cases. To 
171 
  
10 
 
assess exposure to running (and other sports and activities), participants were mailed 
172 
questionnaires20, 42, 47 or were interviewed33.   
173 
The studies based in Finland and Sweden33, 42, 47 were able to randomly select controls from national 
174 
registers of the base population. The US-based study20 recruited controls from the Stanford Lipid 
175 
Research Study. Three of the case control studies matched on age and sex. Thelin 2006 additionally 
176 
matched on residency area. Sandmark 1999 did not report matching. 
177 
Two of the studies20, 33 investigated running, whilst one study47 focussed on orienteering, and one 
178 
study42 measured both jogging and orienteering. All case-control studies included both males and 
179 
females.

NARRATIVE SYNTHESIS 
185 
Findings from each study are summarised in Table 2. 
186 
Diagnosis of knee OA 
187 
 
188 
Seven cohort studies included diagnosis as an outcome, three of which measured incidence 
189 
prospectively. The diagnostic criteria used were different in almost every study (see Table 2). Of the 
190 
4 studies which reported formal statistical comparisons, three found no differences in knee OA 
191 
diagnoses between groups, though two were small in size and likely under-powered 21, 39. The two 
192 
large studies found: firstly, no difference in knee OA rates between runners and controls within the 
193 
same cohort, over 8 years 10; and secondly, significantly increased odds of knee OA diagnosis 
194 
amongst elite orienteers compared to controls 25.  
195 
One case control study 47 identified cases of tibiofemoral OA diagnosis from 6 hospital registers (see 
196 
Table 3). The findings indicated no significant difference in the odds of knee OA in patients who had 
197 
previously participated regularly in orienteering. 
198 
One publication from a prospective cohort reported the results of a case-cohort analysis 28. This 
199 
result was not extracted because the analysis was not in keeping with the original study design.  
200 
 
201 
Radiographic/imaging markers 
202 
 
203 
Nine cohort studies examined radiographic outcomes: six measured osteophytes; one sclerosis; 
204 
three assessed cartilage thickness, volume or joint surface area; one measured knee joint angle; one 
205 
looked at joint space; and one study employed a composite score (Table 2). 
206 
  
14 
 
For all but two of these outcomes, no significant differences were reported. Lane 1986 26 found 
207 
female, but not male, runners had a higher mean sclerosis score at baseline; and Muhlbauer 2000 37 
208 
found male triathletes had a greater joint surface area than controls. 
209 
Two studies specifically used MRI to identify joint changes in response to jogging (30mins) 36 or 
210 
running a marathon 15. Hohmann 2005 was a small study with no comparison reported. Mosher 
211 
2010 found a significant difference in femoral cartilage thickness between marathon runners and 
212 
controls before, but not after, a 30-minute ’jog’, and only amongst older participants. 
213 
No case control studies identified cases using radiographic markers of knee OA. 
214 
 
215 
Arthroplasty for knee OA 
216 
None of the cohort studies assessed this outcome. 
217 
Three case control studies identified cases of knee arthroplasty from hospital registers 20, 33, 42. No 
218 
formal comparison was made between runners or orienteers and controls in the Sandmark 1999 
219 
study, although crude numbers of participants reporting jogging were lower amongst cases than 
220 
controls. The other two studies found no significant differences. 
221 
 
222 
Knee pain 
223 
Three cohort studies assessed knee pain as an outcome. Two of the studies did not report 
224 
comparisons 18, 39. The other study found no significant difference in the odds of knee pain between 
225 
elite orienteers and controls 25. 
226 
No case control studies identified cases of knee pain. 
227 
 
228 
  
15 
 
Knee-associated disability 
229 
Only two studies investigated knee-related function or disability as an outcome 19, 25. Only Kujala 
230 
1999 presented formal statistical comparisons, showing no significant difference in the odds of knee 
231 
associated disability between male elite orienteers and controls. 
232 
No case control studies defined cases on the basis of knee-associated disability.

META-ANALYSIS 
243 
Due to the heterogeneity of outcome definition and measurement of studies, only one meta-analysis 
244 
was appropriate: this combined the case-control studies which identified cases of knee surgery due 
245 
to OA (Figure 1). The combined odds ratio of undergoing knee surgery due to OA was 0.46 (95% CI 
246 
0.30, 0.71) in runners or orienteers when compared with non-runners. The I2 was 0%, with 95% CI 
247 
0% to 73%. No subgroup or sensitivity analyses were undertaken due to the small number of studies.

Discussion 
252 
This review has systematically gathered the peer-reviewed evidence regarding the role of running in 
253 
the development of knee OA. Five types of outcome relating to knee OA were considered: diagnosis, 
254 
radiographic markers, surgery, and the symptomatic indicators of consistent knee pain and knee-
255 
associated disability.  
256 
From this evidence, it is not possible to conclude if running was associated with diagnosis of knee 
257 
OA, chiefly because the two best quality studies identified 10, 25 offered differing conclusions (one 
258 
finding no association and one finding a positive relationship). Nor was there evidence to support a 
259 
difference in radiographic or other imaging markers between runners and controls, with the 
260 
exception being two studies which observed differences at baseline and only among subgroups 
261 
  
21 
 
(females, 26 and older adults 36). At follow-up, observed differences in these studies were not 
262 
apparent. Evidence relating to symptomatic outcomes was sparse and therefore inconclusive.  
263 
However, a key finding of this review was the result of the meta-analysis, which was suggestive of 
264 
around a 50% reduced odds of surgery due to OA amongst runners. The meta-analysis was based on 
265 
case-control evidence and presents for the first time the odds ratio for the proportions reported in 
266 
the Sandmark 1999 study. The meta-analysis result contradicts the apparent increased odds of OA 
267 
diagnosis reported by Kujala 1999 as well as the conclusion of Felson 2007 in which no effect of 
268 
running on OA diagnosis was found. There are a few possible explanations for these inconsistencies.  
269 
Firstly, the differences could be due to the different study designs, with the latter two studies 
270 
employing prospective cohorts, whilst the meta-analysis used only retrospective data, which could 
271 
reflect recall bias. No cohort evidence in this review investigated surgery as an outcome.  
272 
Secondly, the populations under investigation are not the same. Kujala 1999 was based on elite-level 
273 
orienteers only, in contrast to the broader exposure levels implied by the samples of Felson 2007 
274 
and the case-control studies. Although this review was broad in its definition of running, it is possible 
275 
that different types and performance levels of running relate differently to knee OA. 
276 
Thirdly, the outcomes are differently defined in these studies. Whilst surgery is often taken as a 
277 
proxy for severe OA diagnosis, it could be speculated that the relationship between running and OA 
278 
varies according to disease severity. So, for example, running could protect against OA progressing 
279 
to severe stages, if not against diagnosis of mild or moderate OA. This remains conjecture at this 
280 
point, due to the paucity of evidence.  
281 
The literature on overall leisure-time physical activity and knee joint replacement is a little more 
282 
plentiful, but no more conclusive. Studies have variously reported no association 1, 2, 33, a dose-
283 
response increase in risk 52, or a reduced risk but only at higher levels of activity (in men 33 and in 
284 
women 1). At least two of these studies did not adjust for knee joint injury 2, 52. Manninen et al 
285 
  
22 
 
postulated that the relationship may be non-linear, as quadratic terms improved the fit of regression 
286 
models33, implying a ‘U’-shaped curve. Comparing the findings of this review to the literature on 
287 
physical activity, however, may not be useful, if, as previously discussed, running has a role 
288 
independent of other sports and activities. 
289 
An important caveat in interpreting this evidence relates to its quality. Given the nature of 
290 
observational studies, only low-to-moderate quality evidence could be expected 13. However, the 
291 
assessment of potential bias undertaken in this review indicated that many studies would be 
292 
downgraded to low or very low quality. Just four studies were prospective (or ambispective) in 
293 
design, and only one of these 10 was a large, well-designed, prospective study addressing 
294 
recreational (as well as more competitive) running, with controls recruited from same source, and 
295 
appropriately adjusted analyses. 
296 
Most studies failed to take previous injury into account when looking at OA outcomes. Just two 
297 
studies 10, 33 adjusted for knee injury in analyses, and four studies excluded participants with prior 
298 
injury 15, 36, 37, 42. This is a key weakness in the evidence, given the strong association between injury 
299 
and development of OA 3, 49. Without this adjustment, it cannot be judged whether the positive 
300 
association reported by Kujala 1999, for example, was due to exposure to running (in the form of 
301 
orienteering) or because elite-level orienteers were more prone to injury, therefore increasing their 
302 
odds of OA diagnosis. This confounder could have influenced the results of many of the studies 
303 
presented here. 
304 
The review by Shrier et al 43 concluded that running (at recreational or moderate level) does not 
305 
cause or worsen OA.  However, this included OA of any joint. The current review was unable to make 
306 
a similar conclusion, due to the paucity of and contradictions in the evidence relating specifically to 
307 
knee OA. Another more recent review 8 reported increased odds for elite-level runners. However 
308 
this was based only on two papers 23, 24, and the synthesis of data was methodologically flawed: 
309 
firstly, the prevalence rates of the two papers were combined, despite both papers including runners 
310 
  
23 
 
from the same study, therefore effectively including the same participants twice; and, secondly, the 
311 
authors calculated an additive odds ratio of the two studies, rather than reporting a pooled estimate 
312 
from a meta-analysis). 
313 
In conducting this systematic review, the authors made every effort to minimise bias in identifying 
314 
and collating the evidence: a pre-registered protocol was developed before searches began, and 
315 
PRISMA guidelines have been followed. Independent reviewers assessed each article for eligibility 
316 
and for risk of bias. In addition, the search was not limited by year or language, unlike many previous 
317 
reviews. However, there are still limitations worth remarking on. 
318 
The meta-analysis included only a small number of studies, with odds ratios that represent 
319 
unadjusted proportions (i.e. odds were not adjusted for confounding factors). Although the I2 
320 
indicated low heterogeneity, the upper 95% CI of the I2 is high (73%), and the pooled estimate 
321 
should be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, the pooled result chiefly reflects the findings of 
322 
one study, Sandmark 1999, which has been heavily weighted by the Mantel-Haenszel method. 
323 
However, the smaller studies included in the meta-analysis implied the same direction of effect, 
324 
albeit with wide confidence intervals. 
325 
A strength of the review was including several types of outcome which related to knee OA. This 
326 
allowed exploration into the possible differences in reported relationships according to outcome. 
327 
That different measures may respond differently to an exposure is not a new idea. Urquhart et al 50 
328 
offered a similar explanation for the contrasting findings of their review of physical activity and knee 
329 
joint structures. The small number of studies relevant to each outcome in this review, however, 
330 
makes it hard to establish if this is the case with running. 
331 
This comprehensive search revealed several gaps in the evidence base. For example, none of the 
332 
cohorts had looked at arthroplasty as an outcome. In addition, most of the cohort studies recruited 
333 
runners and controls from different sources, and were at risk of sampling bias, compounded by a 
334 
  
24 
 
failure to account for confounding factors. This review has also highlighted the dearth of evidence in 
335 
recent years – just four publications in the past decade – which is surprising given the divergent (and 
336 
often underpowered) findings previously. More well-designed, prospective evidence would help to 
337 
clarify the contradictions observed. 
338 
 
339 
Conclusion 
340 
This review was unable to conclude a role of running in the development of knee OA. Moderate to 
341 
low quality evidence suggests both a positive association with OA diagnosis and a negative 
342 
association with knee replacement surgery. Divergent results may be a reflection of methodological 
343 
heterogeneity. Alternatively, they may be a result of a non-linear relationship between running 
344 
exposure and risk of OA. It is surprising that research interest in this topic appears to have waned in 
345 
recent years, particularly as participation rates continue to grow in many regions. This is in contrast 
346 
to more studies investigating overall physical activity. However, activity- or sport-specific effects 
347 
should not be ignored and the question of running remains clinically important. Given the many 
348 
established beneficial effects of physical activity on other health outcomes, it is important to 
349 
confidently inform the public about which forms of physical activity they can undertake without 
350 
detriment to their musculoskeletal health. Currently, on the basis of published evidence, we are 
351 
unable to offer advice about even one of the most popular activities, running.
