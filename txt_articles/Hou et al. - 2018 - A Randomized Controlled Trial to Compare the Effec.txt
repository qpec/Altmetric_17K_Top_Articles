Abstract: A low carbohydrate diet (LCD), with some staple food being replaced with nuts, has been
shown to reduce weight, improve blood glucose, and regulate blood lipid in patients with type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM). These nuts include tree nuts and ground nuts. Tree nut consumption is
associated with improved cardio-vascular and inflammatory parameters. However, the consumption of
tree nuts is difficult to promote in patients with diabetes because of their high cost. As the main ground
nut, peanuts contain a large number of beneficial nutrients, are widely planted, and are affordable
for most patients. However, whether peanuts and tree nuts in combination with LCD have similar
benefits in patients with T2DM remains unknown; although almonds are the most consumed and
studied tree nut. This study sought to compare the effect of peanuts and almonds, incorporated into a
LCD, on cardio-metabolic and inflammatory measures in patients with T2DM. Of the 32 T2DM patients
that were recruited, 17 were randomly allocated to the Peanut group (n = 17) and 15 to the Almond
group (n = 15) in a parallel design. The patients consumed a LCD with part of the starchy staple food
being replaced with peanuts (Peanut group) or almonds (Almond group). The follow-up duration
was three months. The indicators for glycemic control, other cardio-metabolic, and inflammatory
parameters were collected and compared between the two groups. Twenty-five patients completed
the study. There were no significant differences in the self-reported dietary compliance between the
two groups. Compared with the baseline, the fasting blood glucose (FBG) and postprandial 2-h blood
glucose (PPG) decreased in both the Peanut and Almond groups (p < 0.05). After the intervention,
no statistically significant differences were found between the Peanut group and the Almond group
with respect to the FBG and PPG levels. A decrease in the glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level from
the baseline in the Almond group was found (p < 0.05). However, no significant difference was found
between the two groups with respect to the HbA1c level at the third month. The peanut and almond
consumption did not increase the body mass index (BMI) and had no effect on the blood lipid profile
or interleukin-6 (IL-6).In conclusion, incorporated into a LCD, almonds and peanuts have a similar
effect on improving fasting and postprandial blood glucose among patients with T2DM. However,
more studies are required to fully establish the effect of almond on the improvement of HbA1c.

1. Introduction
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease that involves a heterogeneous group of
disorders of the intermediary metabolism, characterized by glucose intolerance [1]. The incidence and
prevalence of T2DM have increased markedly worldwide, and its complications are the leading causes
of morbidity and premature mortality [2]. The use of diet in the prevention, treatment, and control
of T2DM has been recommended, and is one of the strategies for managing the condition. According
to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the nutritional goals for patients with T2DM are to
achieve normoglycemia and a cardio protective lipid profile that reduces the risk for cardiovascular
disease (CVD) [3].
In recent years, a low carbohydrate diet (LCD) has gained popularity [4],and its effectiveness in
reducing weight, improving blood glucose, and regulating blood lipid in patients with T2DM has been
confirmed by the American Diabetes Association and Diabetes UK [5,6]. ALCD combined with a low
saturated fat intake may be best for patients [7].
Nuts are high in unsaturated fat and are a rich source of bioactive nutrients that have the
potential to provide metabolic and cardiovascular benefits [8]. Bodies concerned with diabetes and
CVD (e.g., the Canadian Cardiovascular Society and the European Atherosclerosis Society) are now
advocating for an increase in nut consumption as part of their dietary recommendations [9–12].
Nuts include tree nuts (almond, walnut, hazelnut, pistachio, pine nut, cashew, pecan, macadamia,
and Brazil nut) and ground nuts (mainly peanut). Almonds are the most studied tree nut. Clinical
trials have shown that the consumption of almonds as well as other tree nuts is associated with
improved glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, decreased inflammation, and reduced/sustained body
weight [13–16]. However, tree nuts are difficult to promote in patients with diabetes because of their
high cost, especially in developing and under-developed countries.
As the main ground nut, peanuts have a similar nutrient composition to tree nuts, thus being
nutrient-dense and rich in monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) (40% of energy).They are also a good
source of arginine, fiber, phytosterols, polyphenols, niacin, folic acid, and vitamin E [17]. In addition,
peanuts are widely planted and are much cheaper than tree nuts, and they are affordable for most
T2DM patients. Randomized controlled and cross-over trials have shown that peanut consumption
helps to moderate glucose concentrations [18], improve the postprandial lipid response, and preserve
endothelial function [19]. However, whether peanuts and tree nuts have similar benefits forT2DM
patients remains unknown.
Almonds are the most consumed tree nut [20]. We aim to compare the effect of peanuts and
almonds incorporated into LCD on cardio-metabolic and inflammatory measures in T2DM patients.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Subjects
The participants were recruited from a diabetes club and from the Endocrine Division of the First
Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University. The inclusion criteria were as follows: The patients were
diagnosed with T2DM, had glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of less than 10%, had no change in
oral antidiabetic drugs or in insulin half a month before the intervention, were between 40 to 80 years
old [15,21], were able to communicate, had volunteered to participate in this study, and were willing
to provide informed consent. Those that were excluded were the patients who ate nuts regularly
(≥four per day/week) [22]; were allergic to nuts or other food; had difficulty in chewing nuts as
a result of fewer teeth or for other reasons; could not adhere to a LCD strategy; received other
dietary interventions; had severe conditions including indigestion, hepatic failure, renal failure, severe
gallbladder and pancreatic diseases, stroke, malignant tumors, or unstable cardiovascular diseases
(such as myocardial infarction, ketosis, or hyperthyroidism); those who were taking glucocorticoid;
and those whose fasting blood glucose (FBG) was more than 16.7 mmol/L [23] during the intervention.

2.2. Study Design
This study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial (RCT) that was performed between
December 2015 and April 2016. The recruited patients were randomly allocated to the Peanut and
Almond groups using a table of random numbers. The random numbers were generated by one
researcher, and were concealed to the researcher who was responsible for the allocation, and the
participants were blinded prior to assignment. Before the intervention, all of the subjects underwent
a one-week washout period [23] to diminish the effect of background diets on the study. This study
followed the Declaration of Helsinki and the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and was approved
by the ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University (no. 2015106). All of the
enrolled participants signed a consent form.
2.3. Sample Size Calculation
Evidence from the literature showed that the mean difference of the changes in the HbA1c
levels were 1.6% between the Peanut group and the Almond group [21,24]. Therefore, we calculated
13 participants for each group, with α = 0.05 and power = 0.80. In light of the sample loss of 10%,
the number for each group was calculated to be 16. Finally, we recruited 15 participants for the Peanut
group and 17 participants for the Almond group in this study.
2.4. Intervention
We incorporated peanuts or almonds into a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD), which is a
dietary strategy that refers to a carbohydrate intake of between 30–200 g/day or calories from
carbohydrates/total calories <45%, being supplemented instead with fat or protein [24]. Our team
developed a LCD education handbook [24] for patients with T2DM based on evidence from the
literature, guidelines regarding T2DM dietary management, consultation with diabetes experts and
nutritionists, and reviews by patients. The researcher and patients reviewed the LCD handbook, and the
researcher trained the patients to restrict their intake of starchy staple food (such as potatoes and broad
beans) to 50 g/meal per day during the one-on-one education session. The reduced staple food/meal
was substituted by consuming 60 g/day peanuts for men and 50 g/day for women in the Peanut
group [25], and 55 g/day almonds for men and 45 g/day for women in the Almond group [25,26].
The peanuts and almonds (without salt and with the skin intact, and free of charge) were prepared in
vacuum packing, according to a daily amount. The patients were instructed to consume nuts between
meals or with breakfast, or when hungry. For those whose fasting plasma glucose were higher than
normal (>6.1 mmol/L), the nuts were required to be consumed before 10:00 a.m. in the morning [27].
The patients were instructed to consume 50% of the nuts before bedtime if there was a risk of a nocturnal
hypoglycemic event. The intervention duration was three months for the two groups.
The follow-ups were conducted once a week in the first month of the intervention, and once every
two weeks in the second and third months. The duration of each follow-up session was about 10 min.
The patients’ compliance to the dietary plan was reviewed and those with a poor compliance were
supported in order to adhere to the plan. The data relating to modification of hypoglycemic agents and
the occurrence of hypoglycemia were also collected. Those whose diets did not meet the requirements
of the dietary program in the intervention period were excluded from the study.
2.5. Diet Record
The patients maintained a diet record, including details of the diet of any day over the weekend
and two working days, as well as the time of nut consumption. The types and quantities of the food
consumed were assessed to determine the patients’ adherence to a LCD strategy. Among the patients
who met the dietary requirements for a LCD, the number of bags of nuts consumed per week was
assessed to determine the patients’ dietary adherence.

2.6. Cardio-Metabolic and Anthropometric Parameters
The cardio-metabolic and anthropometric parameters included the FBG, postprandial 2-h
blood glucose (PPG) levels, HbA1c, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C),
high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, and body mass index (BMI). The HbA1c,
blood lipids, and BMI were measured at the baseline and at the end of the third month. Venous
blood samples were collected at the School of Nursing of Soochow University after a 12 h overnight
fast. The HbA1c was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography using Afinion AS100
Analyzer (Alere, Inc., Shanghai, China), and the total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides
were measured using the spectrophotometry method in the molecular laboratory of the School of
Nursing of Soochow University. The height and weight were measured using a calibrated stadiometer,
and the patients were weighed wearing light clothing and without shoes. The BMI was calculated as
the weight (in kilograms) divided by the square of the height (in meters). The FBG and PPG levels
were measured by collecting the peripheral blood from the fingers using a rapid glycemic apparatus
by patients once a week at home. The glycemic meters were checked by the research staff and the
patients were educated to measure the FBG and PPG correctly so as to reduce the subject bias.
2.7. Hypoglycemic Episodes and Antidiabetic Medication Modification
Hypoglycemic episodes in this study were determined by the patients’ self-reported hypoglycemic
symptoms, with or without a measured plasma glucose concentration of ≤70 mg/dL (≤3.9 mmol/L),
according to the definition of hypoglycemia in diabetes, given by the American Diabetes
Association [28]. To assess the modification of the hypoglycemic agents, the use and changes of
the doses of oral antidiabetic drugs and insulin were recorded at the baseline and in the third month.
2.8. Interleukin-6
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was measured to assess the impact of peanuts and almonds on inflammation.
The fasting venous blood was collected and the serum was separated in the molecular laboratory of the
School of Nursing of Soochow University. Human IL-6 ELISA kit (R&D SystemsTM, Emeryville, CA, USA)
was used to determine the IL-6 levels in the Hematology Center of the Cyrus Tang Medical Institute at
Soochow University.
2.9. Ratio of Urinary Albumin/Creatinine
In order to determine the safety of peanuts and almonds in patients with diabetes, a mid-stream
specimen of random urine was collected, and the ratio of urinary albumin/creatinine (ACR) was
measured using a dry immune marker scattering quantitative method [29].
2.10. Statistical Analysis
A statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 18.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Dhicago, IL, USA).
For continuous variables, the results were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Comparisons
were performed using a t-test for the independent samples for general baseline demographic,
and clinical characteristics, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the outcomes of interest.
To eliminate the problem of imbalance in the baseline characteristics, the comparisons of anthropometric
and metabolic variables between the groups after the intervention were performed using a covariance
analysis with the baseline measurements adjusted. The trends in the dietary adherence, FBG, and PPG
in the two groups, which were assessed once a week during the intervention, were analyzed using
repeated ANOVA, and have been presented as a fold line diagram. The intention-to-treat (ITT) of
HbA1c was performed so as to ensure the reliability of the research results. For the categorical variables,
the results were presented as numbers and percentages, and comparisons between the groups were
performed using the Chi-squared test or the Fisher’s exact test. A p value of <0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

3. Results
3.1. Study Participants
On the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 32 T2DM participants were recruited and
randomly allocated to the Peanut group (n = 15) and the Almond group (n = 17). Four participants
in the Peanut group and three participants in the Almond group withdrew from the study. In the
Peanut group, one participant did not like peanuts, one showed abnormally elevated FPG after
the first week, one’s uric acid increased during the second week (with a history of increased uric
acid), and one showed a poor adherence (<four per day/week). In the Almond group, one did not
like almonds, one was lost to follow-up, and one could not adhere to the diet program because of
toothache. Finally, the data of 11 patients in the Peanut group and 14 in the Almond group were
analyzed (Figure 1). The mean age of the participants was 69.60 ± 7.25 years, and 15 (60.0%) were
men. The general characteristics of the enrolled participants in each group are shown in Table 1.
There were no statistically significant differences in any of the parameters between the two groups
(p > 0.05, Table 1). The time of exercise per week in the two groups did not change significantly from
the baseline, and there was no statistically significant difference found at the third month.

4. Discussion
This is the first study that compared the effect of peanuts and almonds in patients with T2DM,
when incorporated into a LCD diet in order to replace some staple food. The diet diaries revealed that
the participants had a good adherence to the dietary intervention, and no significant difference with
respect to nut adherence was found between the two groups. This RCT showed that, in combination
with a LCD diet, peanuts yielded similar reductions in FBG and PPG compared to almonds.
4.1. Effect of Peanuts and Almonds on Glycemic Control
High levels of FBG, PPG, and HbA1c are some of the most difficult challenges faced by patients
with T2DM, and these parameters could be used as the main indicators in order to establish a glycemic
control [30]. This study showed that both peanuts and almonds incorporated into a LCD diet resulted
in reductions in FBG and PPG after the intervention, which is consistent with previous research
results [18,21,31]. The reason might lie in the fact that there is a decrease in the total amount of
carbohydrate rich foods in a LCD. In addition, peanuts and almonds are rich in fat, they possess a
low-glycemic index, and could alter the glycemic index of co-consumed foods [32]. What is more,
the greater fat availability may reduce the gastric emptying rate, and may decrease the carbohydrate
absorption rate [33].
However, the content of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) and soluble fiber in almonds is higher
than that in peanuts [17]. UFAs could facilitate the movement of the glucose receptor to the cell surface,
thus increasing the insulin sensitivity [34]. UFAs also act through the stimulation of GLP-1 secretion,
which improves the efficacy of the β-cell function [35]. Soluble fiber increases the gastric distention,
viscosity in the gastrointestinal tract, and the slower absorption of macronutrients [36]. In this way,
it lowers the speed of carbohydrate absorption and the concentration of PPG [37]. Based on the above
reasons, the glycemic effect of almonds may be more stable than that of peanuts. In our study, although
peanuts and almonds yielded similar reductions in FBG and PPG by the end of the three-months
intervention, the amplitude of the fluctuation of the PPG in the Peanut group was significantly larger
than that of the Almond group.
The HbA1c level can reflect the mean blood glucose level over the last 8–12 weeks, and can be used
to evaluate the long-term glycemic control of patients [30]. HbA1c has a closer association with PPG
than FPG [38]. In the present study, the effect of peanuts on the HbA1c reduction was not significant.
This might be due to the fluctuation of PPG in the Peanut group. The result of our study is in line with
the RCT by Wien et al. [39], which did not find that incorporating peanuts into an American Diabetes
Association meal plan had a significant effect in decreasing HbA1c in adults with T2DM. Although
there was a 0.48% decrease in HbA1c from the baseline caused by almond consumption, the greater
effect of almonds on the improvement of HbA1c was not found by the third month, compared to
peanuts. The short-term duration of the follow-up may be one of the reasons for this. After a 24-week
almond intervention, Gulati et al. [40] found a statistically significant improvement in the levels of
HbA1c compared with the control diet.
4.2. Other Cardio-Metabolic Indicators
The consumption of peanuts and almonds has not been associated with increased body weight,
despite their high lipid content. Human feeding trials have shown that nut ingestion moderates
appetite postprandially [41]. The inclusion of peanuts and almonds increases a feeling of satiety
and leads to a strong dietary compensation effect. In addition, because of the inefficiency in energy
absorption, nut consumption does not promote a greater energy intake than other foods [41]. In a
randomized cross-over study, after 12 weeks of incorporating high oleic peanuts into the diet, a less than
predicted increase in the body weight was found, despite a large additional amount of energy being
consumed from the peanuts [25]. Similarly, Li et al. [26] and Gulati et al. [40] also reported no changes
in the body weight and BMI with the almond diet, however, a statistically significant improvement was
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 1565
12 of 16
seen in the body fat [26], waist circumference, and waist-to-height ratio [40]. Sato et al. [42] reported a
significant improvement of BMI on a LCD diet on in T2DM patients with higher baseline levels of BMI
(26.5 Kg/m2). Among the subjects with a relative normal baseline BMI, this study did not find that
peanuts or almonds incorporated into a LCD diet had a significant reduction on the BMI.
The total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglyceride levels were not altered significantly with an
almond or peanut diet in this study, contrary to many other studies [14]. However, the cholesterol lowering
effects of nuts are shown to be the greatest in individuals with higher baseline lipids [43]. The subjects in
this study had an average healthy baseline lipid level. Barbour et al. [25] and Wien et al. [39] also reported
no differences in lipids with peanut consumption in subjects with healthy baseline lipid levels.
4.3. Hypoglycemia and Medication Changes
The antidiabetic drugs and insulin doses used in the Peanut and Almond groups were identical.
There was no interference caused by the agents when comparing the glycemic control effects between
peanuts and almonds in this study.
We used hypoglycemia as a safety indicator. Although there was no significant difference in
the between-group comparison, the percentage of hypoglycemia was reduced from 18.2% to zero in
the Peanut group. Nocturnal hypoglycemia occurred in two participants in the Peanut group before
the intervention, and it was recommended that they consume 50% of their prescribed peanuts before
bedtime. The occurrence of hypoglycemia in the morning causes the body to produce a large amount
of glucocorticoids, namely the Somogyi effect, leading to increased blood glucose in the morning [44].
Peanuts and almonds, which are rich in healthy fat, can delay the speed of gastric emptying, and can
continuously supply energy [27] to the body so as to prevent the occurrence of the Somogyi effect.
During the intervention in the Almond group, daytime hypoglycemia occurred in one case because of
strenuous exercise, and there was no nocturnal hypoglycemia found.
4.4. Effect of Peanuts and Almonds on Interleukin-6
IL-6 was chosen as an indicator of inflammation. Chronic low-level inflammation plays an
important role in the occurrence and development of DM [17,45]. IL-6 is the source of the metabolic
syndrome induced by inflammation, and plays a core regulatory role in the inflammatory response [46,47].
IL-6 can inhibit insulin signaling transduction and could therefore impede the action of insulin [47].
Peanuts are rich in folic acid, which can inhibit the cascade of a reaction in the process of
inflammation in vessel wall, and this may reduce the release of vascular inflammatory factors [48].
Although the administration of folic acid can cause a decrease in the concentration of homocysteine,
and, as a consequence, could influence the decrease in the concentration of the indicators of
inflammation [49], a decrease of IL-6 caused by peanut consumption was not found in this study.
As an indicator of inflammation, the C reactive protein (CRP) did not improve after 12-week of peanut
consumption in the study by Barbour et al. [25]. Contrary to our study, in the study by Gulati et al. [40],
a significant improvement in the CRP was found after 24-weeks of almond consumption. Whether
the inconsistency in the improvement of inflammation between studies is correlated to the different
intervention duration needs to be further verified.
4.5. Effect of Peanuts and Almonds on Kidney Burden
ACR is a sensitive indicator of early renal damage [50], which is used to assess the impact of
peanuts and almonds incorporated into a LCD on renal function in this study. Our study found
that peanut and almond consumption with a LCD did not increase the burden on the kidney.
Díaz-López et al. also reported no change in ACR after a one-year Mediterranean diet supplemented
with nuts [51].

5. Limitation
There are some limitations to this study. Firstly, the sample size was small. There was also an
imbalance in the gender, diabetes duration, and baseline HbA1c level between groups, although
there were no significant differences found. The prolonged effect of peanuts and almonds on the
prognosis of T2DM was not observed because of the short follow-up duration. Finally, measurement
differences might exist in the FBG and PPG levels, which were measured by the patients themselves,
using different blood glucose meters at home.
6. Conclusions
Incorporated into a low-carbohydrate diet, both peanuts and almonds can improve the fasting
blood glucose and postprandial 2-h blood glucose in patients with T2DM. The effect of almonds in
promoting long-term glycemic control needs to be confirmed by more studies.
