ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND The American Heart Association updated its recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) to pre-
vent infective endocarditis (IE) in 2007, advising that AP cease for those at moderate risk of IE, but continue for those at
high risk.
OBJECTIVES The authors sought to quantify any change in AP prescribing and IE incidence.
METHODS High-risk, moderate-risk, and unknown/low-risk individuals with linked prescription and Medicare or com-
mercial health care data were identified in the Truven Health MarketScan databases from May 2003 through August 2015
(198,522,665 enrollee-years of data). AP prescribing and IE incidence were evaluated by Poisson model analysis.
RESULTS By August 2015, the 2007 recommendation change was associated with a significant 64% (95% confidence
interval [CI]: 59% to 68%) estimated fall in AP prescribing for moderate-risk individuals and a 20% (95% CI: 4% to 32%)
estimated fall for those at high risk. Over the same period, there was a barely significant 75% (95% CI: 3% to 200%)
estimated increase in IE incidence among moderate-risk individuals and a significant 177% estimated increase (95% CI:
66% to 361%) among those at high risk. In unknown/low-risk individuals, there was a significant 52% (95% CI: 46% to
58%) estimated fall in AP prescribing, but no significant increase in IE incidence.
CONCLUSIONS AP prescribing fell among all IE risk groups, particularly those at moderate risk. Concurrently,
there was a significant increase in IE incidence among high-risk individuals, a borderline significant increase in
moderate-risk individuals, and no change for those at low/unknown risk. Although these data do not establish a cause–
effect relationship between AP reduction and IE increase, the fall in AP prescribing in those at high risk is of concern and,
coupled with the borderline increase in IE incidence among those at moderate risk, warrants further investigation.

 I
nfective
endocarditis
(IE)
is
a
life-
threatening infection with high morbi-
dity and w30% first-year mortality (1).
Although uncommon, a large
number
of
individuals with predisposing cardiac condi-
tions are at increased risk of IE (2). Prevent-
ing IE in those at risk has been the focus of
international guidelines since the American
Heart
Association
(AHA)
first
advocated
antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) before invasive
medical and dental procedures in 1955 (3).
However, there has never been a trial of AP
to define its efficacy (4). This, and concerns
about the risk of adverse reactions and the
development of antibiotic resistance, led to reduc-
tions in the populations of individuals targeted for
AP. In 2007, the AHA recommended AP be restricted
to those at high risk of IE and its complications who
were
undergoing
invasive
dental
procedures
(5).
The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) published
similar
guidance
in
2009
(6),
whereas
the
U.K.
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
(NICE) recommended the complete cessation of AP
in 2008 (7).
Following the NICE recommendation, Dayer et al.
(8)
demonstrated an 89%
fall in AP prescribing
in England and a significant increase in IE. Similar
studies were performed following the 2007 AHA
(9–16) and 2009 ESC (17,18) recommendation changes,
with varying results. Importantly, however, none of
these studies included data on the impact of the
recommended changes on AP prescribing.
The aim of this investigation was to quantify
changes in AP prescribing and IE incidence following
the 2007 AHA recommendations in individuals at
high, moderate, or unknown/low risk of IE, using
commercial and Medicare data and linked prescrip-
tion benefit data from the Truven Health MarketScan
databases that cover a large proportion of the U.S.
population.
METHODS
The MarketScan databases are a collection of HIPAA
(Health
Insurance
Portability
and
Accountability
Act)-compliant datasets that integrate deidentified
patient-level health data across commercial health
insurance, Medicare supplemental insurance, and
Medicaid programs covering physician office visits,
inpatient
and
outpatient
hospital
services,
and
outpatient prescription drug coverage (19,20). They
provide one of the largest U.S. health care data
samples with 240 million covered lives and 32 billion
service records (19,20). The commercial data include
employees, spouses, and dependents covered by
employer-sponsored
private
health
insurance
involving more than 260 employers and 40 health
plans (19,20). Medicare data have been gathered from
supplemental Medicare programs, where a secondary
payer to Medicare exists, typically employer-based
retiree health insurance. The Medicaid data cover
44 million enrollees from multiple states (20).
All commercial insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid
enrollees over the age of 18 years, with linked pre-
scription benefit data, were identified for the period
May 1, 2003, through August 31, 2015. Preliminary
analysis identified a large age distribution change in
enrollees with Medicaid-covered prescription drug
benefits in January 2006, due to transfer of Medicare-
eligible persons (mainly persons >65 years of age) to
the newly instituted Medicare Part D prescription
drug coverage (Online Figure 1). Thus, Medicaid data
were unreliable for studying longitudinal change and
were excluded from this investigation. The change,
however, did not impact Medicare supplemental in-
surance data. Together, the MarketScan Commercial
and
Medicare
Supplemental
databases
provide
a
large
nationally
representative
data
sample
of
Americans with employer-provided health insurance
(19,20).
For each enrollee, AP prescriptions were identified
as defined by the AHA recommendations (a single oral
dose of amoxicillin 2 g, clindamycin 600 mg, cepha-
lexin 2 g, azithromycin 500 mg, or clarithromycin
500 mg) (5), and IE hospital admissions were identi-
fied using diagnosis International Classification of
Disease (ICD) codes (ICD-9 code 421.0, 421.1, or 421.9,
primary or secondary discharge diagnoses). Previ-
ously described methods were used to ensure single,
continuous episodes of IE were counted once (21).
The database was searched back to January 2000
to identify any ICD-9 or CPT (Current Procedural
Terminology)
diagnosis
or
procedure
codes
occurring before an IE admission that would have

 placed an individual at high or moderate risk of IE
(Online Tables 1 and 2) (5,22). Patients who did not
develop IE were categorized in the same way if any of
the relevant codes appeared in their records between
January 2000 and August 2015. After an enrollee
had an IE-related hospital admission, they were
considered at high risk for further new episodes of IE.
New
IE
episodes
were
distinguished
from
read-
missions by only accepting IE admissions >6 months
apart as new episodes (2,23). Individuals not identi-
fied as moderate or high risk were considered to be at
unknown/low risk of IE.
We also quantified the total reimbursed inpatient
payment costs to all providers of care (hospitals,
physicians, and any ancillary payments) for each
continuous period of IE hospital admission (including
transfers between hospitals for treatment of the same
episode of IE) and the total reimbursed amount to
pharmacies for each AP prescription.
The AHA AP recommendations were first available
online on April 19, 2007, but were not published in
hard copy until October 2007 (5). Most dentists would
not have been aware of the changes until a summary
was published in the Journal of the American Dental
Association
in
June
2007
(24).
Previous
studies,
however, have shown that it can take 18 months
following guideline change for new AP recommen-
dations to be widely adopted (8,21). For descriptive
purposes,
the
data
were
therefore
divided
into
3
periods:
1)
pre-recommendation
(May
1,
2003,
through April 31, 2007); 2) transition (18 months
from May 1, 2007, through October 31, 2008); and
3) post-recommendation (November 1, 2008, through
August 31, 2015). To evaluate for any change, Poisson
regression
models
with
exponential
conditional
means and first-order residual autocorrelation were
used so that they imposed a multiplicative relation-
ship between the outcome and the explanatory vari-
ables, to model any change in the event rate (events/
population) for both AP prescribing and IE incidence
using the number of enrollees as a weight (see
the Online Methods, for details). The models allowed
for pre-recommendation time trends that were linear
on the linked (logarithmic) scale. The shift from the
pre-recommendation period to transition period was
modeled with an intercept change and time trend
change; the shift from the transition period to post-
recommendation period was modeled with a second
slope change but no intercept change. Age group and
sex interactions were included as controls to account
for demographic influences. The event rates were
analyzed separately for high-risk, moderate-risk, and
unknown/low-risk
enrollees.
The
Poisson
model
analysis
provided
estimates
for
the
level
of
AP
prescribing or IE incidence that would result if the
pre-recommendation change trends continued into
the future without other factors intervening. By
comparing the predicted AP and IE incidence figures
in the transition or
post-recommendation period
estimated from the Poisson model, with and without
the 2007 AHA recommendation change in effect,
we obtained estimates for the size of changes in AP
prescribing rates and IE admission rates associated
with the recommendation change, controlling for
pre-existing time trends and patient composition.
Thus, the Poisson models allowed us to estimate the
effect of the recommendations change on level of AP
prescribing and IE incidence at specific times after the
recommendations change, that is, the difference in
the level of AP prescribing or IE incidence/month/
100,000 enrollees estimated by the fitted regression
models with and without the recommendations in
effect.
RESULTS
POPULATION DEMOGRAPHICS. Age and sex distri-
butions of the study population over time are shown
in Figure 1. Changes in the different health care
coverage populations over time are shown in Online
Figures
1
to
3.
The
study
included
198,522,665
enrollee-years of data of which 1,266,695 (0.64%)
were high risk, 11,733,117 (5.91%) moderate risk, and
185,522,852 (93.45%) unknown/low risk. The ratio of
moderate-risk/high-risk enrollees remained relatively
constant (Figure 2). In the last year of the study, 0.83%
of enrollees were high risk and 7.21% were moderate
risk. The proportion of high-risk and moderate-risk
individuals was higher among Medicare than com-
mercial health care enrollees (Online Figures 4 to 6).
In
total,
there
were
20,340
episodes
of
IE
and
1,910,544 AP prescriptions issued. The breakdown of
this by risk and health insurer type is show in Table 1.
AP
PRESCRIBING. In
the
pre-recommendation
period, AP prescribing was decreasing for all risk
types
(Central
Illustration).
The
fall
was
steeper
within the transition period with a shallower down-
ward
trend
in
the
post-recommendation
period.
The Poisson model analyses allowed us to compare
the predicted level of AP prescribing at specific
time
points
during
the
transition
and
post-
recommendation periods with the Poisson model
estimate of what the level of AP prescribing would
have
been
at
each
time
point
had
the
pre-
recommendation
trend
in
prescribing
continued
unaltered (Figure 3, Online Table 3). By August 2015,
there was a 20% overall reduction (0.80 proportional
change; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.68 to 0.96) in

 those at high risk, a decrease of 297 (95% CI: 223 to
371) from an estimate of 464 (95% CI: 390 to 538) AP
prescriptions/month/100,000 to 167 AP prescriptions/
month/100,000 for those at moderate risk and a
decrease of 45 (95% CI: 25 to 64) from an estimate of
86 (95% CI: 66 to 105) AP prescriptions/month/
100,000 to 41 AP prescriptions/month/100,000 for
those at low/unknown risk of IE.
INCIDENCE OF IE. IE incidence was declining in the
pre-recommendation period. The rate of decline was
highest in individuals at high risk, intermediate for
moderate
risk,
and
lowest
for
low/unknown-risk
individuals.
In
the
post-recommendation
period,
although there remained a slight downward trend in
all 3 groups, the rate of decrease was less. Poisson
model analyses (Figure 3) showed that, compared
with the pre-recommendation period, there was an
increase in IE incidence in high- and moderate-risk
populations
in
the
post-recommendation
period
relative to what would have been expected without
the recommendation change. By August 2015, we
estimated there had been a 177% increase (2.77
proportional change; 95% CI: 1.66 to 4.61) above what
would have been expected in IE incidence in those at
high risk, a 75% increase (1.75 proportional change;
95% CI: 1.03 to 3.00) in the moderate-risk group and
no
significant
increase
in
the
low/unknown-risk
group (1.12 proportional change; 95% CI: 0.71 to
1.76). These changes equated to an increase of 19.53
(95% CI: 14.22 to 24.84) from the model-based esti-
mate of 11.04 (95% CI: 5.73 to 16.35) IE cases/month/
100,000 to 30.57 IE cases/month/100,000 among
those at high risk of IE, an increase of 1.47 (95% CI:
0.44 to 2.50) from an estimate of 1.94 (95% CI: 0.91
to 2.97) IE cases/month/100,000 to 3.41 IE cases/
month/100,000 among those at moderate risk of
IE and no significant increase in the low/unknown-
risk group (0.04 IE case/month/100,000; 95% CI:
�0.12 to 0.20).
COST OF INPATIENT IE CARE AND AP PRESCRIPTIONS.
The reimbursed costs for inpatient IE care/10,000
enrollees
rose
throughout
the
period
of
study
(Figure 4A), despite an overall reduction in IE cases.
This
was
because
the
cost
of
treating
IE
cases
(Figure 4B) increased from an average of $43,978 in
the first year to $92,413 in the last year of the study.
By contrast, reimbursed AP prescription costs/10,000
enrollees fell (Figure 4A) throughout the study. This
was partly because of the fall in AP prescribing
but also because the reimbursed cost of each AP
prescription fell from an average of $5.36 in the first
year of the study to $2.00 in the last year. Separate
reimbursement costs for commercial, Medicare, and
Medicaid
providers
are
provided
online
(Online
Table 4, Online Figure 7).
DISCUSSION
This study provides an estimate of the proportions of
the U.S. population at moderate (7.21%) or high risk
(0.83%) of IE (Central Illustration). The proportion of
Medicare enrollees at high or moderate risk of IE
was much higher than for commercial health care
enrollees (Online Figures 4 to 6). This difference
may, in part, be due to the older age of patients
in the Medicare population with a typically higher
burden
of
chronic
valvular
disease
and
cardiac
implantable electronic devices. This may also explain
the higher overall IE incidence in Medicare patients
(Table 1).
There was a decline in IE incidence in all 3 risk
categories of patients in the period between May
2003 and the change in AHA AP recommendations
in April 2007. This may reflect introduction of the
modified
Duke
criteria
in
April
2000
(25)
and
increased use of transesophageal echocardiography
for IE diagnosis (26). Both interventions increased
diagnostic specificity and reduced the number of
“definite” IE cases diagnosed by excluding some
cases
previously
considered
“possible.”
Previous
studies have reported conflicting trends in IE inci-
dence over the period of the current study (9–16).
AP prescribing before 2007 declined for all 3 risk
categories.

 slight increase. The factors responsible for these
trends are not entirely clear. AP prescribing patterns
for individuals with low/unknown risk of IE suggest
the possibility of some overprescribing that decreased
over time. The 1997 AHA recommendations (22), in
place before 2007, advised AP for moderate- and
high-risk individuals. They also included a more
complex list of cardiac conditions and a more exten-
sive list of medical and dental procedures for which
AP was recommended. By 2003 to 2004, these rec-
ommendations had been in place for several years,
and many clinicians were aware of views subse-
quently embedded in the 2007 guidelines (5), that is,
that many patients with cardiac conditions previously
included for AP did not need it. Moreover, there was
little evidence to support the use of AP for many of
the medical procedures previously recommended for
coverage, (e.g., genitourinary, gastrointestinal, hep-
atobiliary, ear, nose, and throat, respiratory tract in-
terventions).
These
observations,
along
with
concerns about the risk of adverse drug reactions and
selection of drug resistance, may have contributed to
the pre-2007 fall in AP prescribing.
Following publication of the 2007 AHA recom-
mendations (5), there was a significant reduction in
AP prescribing. Consistent with the new recommen-
dations, the greatest reduction was among those at
moderate risk of IE. AP prescribing in this subset did
not,
however,
fall
to
zero,
with
2,036
AP
pre-
scriptions/month/100,000 enrollees still being pre-
scribed by August 2015. Similarly, for those at low/
unknown risk of IE, 6,064 AP prescriptions/month/
100,000 enrollees were still being prescribed by
August 2015. More concerning, however, was the fall
of 186 (95% CI: 51 to 321) AP prescriptions/month/
100,000 among high-risk individuals. This suggests
that despite attempts to simplify recommendations,
there is still confusion among clinicians about which
patients should and should not receive AP (27–29). A
population-based study of AP use in Olmsted County,
Minnesota, also demonstrated a fall in AP prescribing
for high-risk patients following publication of the
2007 AHA recommendations (30). This may reflect
difficulty among dentists in identifying patients at
high versus moderate risk, or lack of knowledge about
current recommendations. To better understand the
factors responsible for the fall in AP prescribing in
those at high risk, and the persistence of AP pre-
scribing in those at moderate or low -risk of IE, a
questionnaire-based survey has been launched to
further investigate the AP prescribing practices of
dentists.
Following the recommendations change, there was
an increase in IE incidence relative to the period
before the change. This was greatest in high-risk in-
dividuals,
much
less
in
those
at
moderate
risk,
despite the much greater reduction in AP prescribing,
and nonexistent in individuals at low/unknown risk.
Although this does not establish a causal relationship
between AP prescribing and IE prevention, our data
provide support for the 2007 AHA guidelines that
recommend against AP in those with no predisposing
cardiac condition, that is, those at low/unknown risk.
In individuals at high risk, a modest fall in AP pre-
scribing occurred at the same time as a relatively large
increase in IE incidence. These observations would
lend support to the current AHA and ESC recom-
mendations that high-risk individuals should receive
AP. For those at moderate risk of IE, a much larger fall
in AP prescribing occurred at the same time as a small
increase in IE incidence, which only reached statisti-
cal significance 80 months after the recommendation
change, that is, December 2013 (Figure 3C, Online
Table 3). This suggests that AP is likely to be less
effective, if it is effective at all, in the majority of
individuals at moderate risk of IE and provides sup-
port for the current AHA and ESC recommendations
not to give AP to those at moderate risk. It does raise
the possibility, however, that a small number of in-
dividuals currently considered at moderate risk, such
as those with certain other predisposing comorbid-
ities or specific cardiac anomalies, such as bicuspid
aortic valve or mitral valve prolapse (31), could
benefit from AP and highlights the need for a more
detailed evaluation of risk among those currently
considered at moderate risk (2).
The cost of treating IE admissions more than
doubled between 2000 and 2015 from $43,978 to
$92,413, whereas the cost of AP prescriptions more
than halved from $5.36 to $2.00. If one assumes that
AP is effective, then this would have increased the
potential cost effectiveness of AP 5-fold. A recent full
health–economic analysis of the effect of the recom-
mendation changes in the United Kingdom found that
AP was likely to be highly cost-effective for those at
high risk of IE and, depending on the degree of AP
efficacy and precise level of risk, could be cost-
effective for some patients at moderate risk (32).
Nonetheless, it is important that factors other than
cost-effectiveness are considered in any decision to
recommend AP, such as the potential development of
adverse consequences of the infection, antibiotic-
related adverse events, and antibiotic resistance.
Numerous studies have attempted to evaluate the
change in IE incidence before and after the 2007 AHA
recommendations (9–16). These studies have used
different methodologies and produced different re-
sults
as
to
whether
IE
incidence
has
increased,

 decreased, or remained stable. Some of these in-
vestigations even included an examination of the
same population (the National Inpatient Sample) and
yet reported different results (10,11,13). None have
included an evaluation of the concurrent effect of the
recommended changes for prescribing AP. The pre-
sent study is the first to examine the concurrent ef-
fects
of
the
recommendation
changes
on
AP
prescribing and IE incidence. It is also the first to
stratify these changes into the different categories of
individual affected, that is, those at high, moderate,
and low/unknown risk for IE.

LIMITATIONS. The data are derived from
administrative databases, which are susceptible to
misclassification, particularly given that IE diagnosis
can be challenging. Nonetheless, a recent study, us-
ing ICD-10 codes, equivalent to the ICD-9 codes used
in this study, found an administrative database had
0.95
sensitivity

criteria
definite
IE
cases
(33).
Furthermore, coding is performed by trained coding
specialists and is based on diagnoses at discharge
rather than at admission. Administrative databases
also allow larger sample sizes than clinical databases
and capture IE hospitalizations in community as well
as tertiary hospitals and thereby avoid referral bias.
The MarketScan databases provide a very large, na-
tionally representative, sample of Americans with
employer-provided
health
insurance
(19,20,34),
including Medicare supplementary insurance, but
may
not
generalize
to
those
without
employer-
provided insurance or the U.S. population as a whole.
This study used CPT and ICD-9 codes to identify
those at moderate- or high-risk of IE. To optimize
identification of these individuals, we accepted any
record (inpatient, outpatient, physician’s office. etc.)
where 1 of these conditions was recorded at any time
before an IE admission (or at any time for those with
no IE admissions). Nonetheless, if the only record of
a
predisposing
procedure
or
condition
occurred
before January 2000, it would be missed, and they
would be considered as low/unknown risk. This
could account for some of the AP prescribing and IE
incidence identified in this low/unknown-risk group.
Nonetheless, the level of AP prescribing, and IE
incidence, was small in the low/unknown-risk group
compared with the other 2 groups and, despite a
decrease in AP prescribing, no increase was seen in
IE incidence, suggesting that any misclassification
was
likely
not
significant.
On
the
other
hand,
misclassification could have resulted in an underes-
timation of the number of individuals at moderate-
or high-IE risk.
It would have been of great interest to determine
whether the observed increases in IE incidence were
due to oral streptococci. Unfortunately, microbiolog-
ical data are not a component of the MarketScan da-
tabases. Furthermore, there are no ICD-9 codes that
specifically identify oral streptococci. In addition,
recording of ICD-9 supplementary codes that might
help identify causal organisms was not a requirement
of the health care coverage plans studied. Recording
of causal organism data was as low as 25%, and varied
over time, between health care coverage plans and
among risk groups, making analysis unreliable. The
inpatient IE reimbursement health care costs used in
this study do not take into account the full health–
economic costs resulting from on-going illness, the
impact on the patient’s quality of life, or the indi-
vidual, family, and societal costs of chronic illness,
unemployment, or premature death (32). Similarly,
the AP prescribing costs do not take into account the
costs associated with adverse drug reactions (35) or
the risk of promoting the selection of antibiotic-
resistant bacteria.
Finally, although this study focused on the value of
AP coverage of invasive dental procedures to prevent
IE, it is likely that more cases of oral streptococcal IE
occur as a result of daily activities such as tooth
brushing, flossing, and mastication, particularly in
those with poor oral hygiene or periodontal disease
(36). AP does not, therefore, reduce the importance of
maintaining good oral hygiene in the prevention of
IE.
CONCLUSIONS
Although our data do not establish a cause-effect
relationship between reduction in AP use and in-
crease in IE incidence, they do provide support for the
current AHA and ESC recommendations that focus AP
on those at high risk of IE. Given the importance that
these recommendations place on AP use in this pa-
tient subgroup, the fall in AP prescribing in those at
high risk is of concern and warrants investigation.
The borderline significant IE increase in those at
moderate risk of IE, despite a large fall in AP pre-
scribing, is concordant with current guidance that
suggests that AP is unlikely to be of benefit in this
group as a whole; however, further investigation into
specific heart valve conditions within the moderate-
risk group may be warranted.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN SYSTEMS-BASED PRACTICE: Following
publication of the American Heart Association/American Dental
Association recommendations on antibiotic prophylaxis, more
restrictive prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis was accompanied
by an increased incidence in cases of infective endocarditis.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Further studies are needed to
determine whether the observed association is causal and, if so,
how best to revise recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis to
prevent endocarditis while minimizing the adverse consequences
of overprescribing antibiotics.
