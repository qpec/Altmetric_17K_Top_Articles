Association Between the 2014 Medicaid Expansion
and US Hospital Finances
Fredric Blavin, PhD
IMPORTANCE The Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid eligibility for millions of
low-income adults. The choice for states to expand Medicaid could affect the financial health
of hospitals by decreasing the proportion of patient volume and unreimbursed expenses
attributable to uninsured patients while increasing revenue from newly covered patients.
OBJECTIVE To estimate the association between the Medicaid expansion in 2014 and hospital
finances by assessing differences between hospitals in states that expanded Medicaid and in
those states that did not expand Medicaid.
DESIGN AND SETTING Observational study with analysis of data for nonfederal general
medical or surgical hospitals in fiscal years 2011 through 2014, using data from the American
Hospital Association Annual Survey and the Health Care Cost Report Information System
from the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Multivariable difference-in-difference
regression analyses were used to compare states with Medicaid expansion with states
without Medicaid expansion. Hospitals in states that expanded Medicaid eligibility before
January 2014 were excluded.
EXPOSURES Medicaid expansion in 2014, accounting for variation in fiscal year start dates.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Hospital-reported information on uncompensated care,
uncompensated care as a percentage of total hospital expenses, Medicaid revenue, Medicaid
as a percentage of total revenue, operating margins, and excess margins.
RESULTS The sample included between 1200 and 1400 hospitals per fiscal year in 19 states
with Medicaid expansion and between 2200 and 2400 hospitals per fiscal year in 25 states
without Medicaid expansion (with sample size varying depending on the outcome
measured). Expansion of Medicaid was associated with a decline of $2.8 million (95% CI,
−$4.1 to −$1.6 million; P < .001) in mean annual uncompensated care costs per hospital.
Hospitals in states with Medicaid expansion experienced a $3.2 million increase (95% CI, $0.9
to $5.6 million; P = .008) in mean annual Medicaid revenue per hospital, relative to hospitals
in states without Medicaid expansion. Medicaid expansion was also significantly associated
with improved excess margins (1.1 percentage points [95% CI, 0.1 to 2.0 percentage points];
P = .04), but not improved operating margins (1.1 percentage points [95% CI, −0.1 to 2.3
percentage points]; P = .06).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The hospitals located in the 19 states that implemented the
Medicaid expansion had significantly increased Medicaid revenue, decreased
uncompensated care costs, and improvements in profit margins compared with hospitals
located in the 25 states that did not expand Medicaid. Further study is needed to assess
longer-term implications of this policy change on hospitals’overall finances.

W
hen the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was passed
in 2010, it mandated the expansion of Medicaid
(effective January 1, 2014), increasing eligibility for
nearly all US residents with household incomes up to 138% of
the federal poverty level. However, the US Supreme Court
struck down the mandatory expansion of Medicaid in 2012
and ruled that each state could choose whether to expand
this entitlement program. As of July 2016, 30 states and
Washington, DC, have elected to expand Medicaid, whereas
20 states have not.1 In March 2016, 72.5 million individuals
were enrolled in Medicaid or the Children’
s Health Insurance
Program compared with the 57.4 million who had been
enrolled just prior to Medicaid expansion.2
In part related to Medicaid expansion, the number of
people without health insurance declined by 17.7 million from
late 2013 through early 2016.3 This decline in the number of
people without health insurance was significantly larger in
states that expanded Medicaid than in states that did not ex-
pand it.4,5
The decision made by states to expand Medicaid could
have important implications for hospitals. Medicaid expan-
sioncoulddecreaseunreimbursedexpensesattributabletoun-
insured patients while increasing revenue from newly cov-
ered patients. This could decrease hospitals’uncompensated
care burden, which can be a significant financial challenge.6-8
However, whether Medicaid expansion has been associ-
ated with improved hospital finances is uncertain. Substitut-
ing Medicaid for uninsured patients may not necessarily im-
prove profits, particularly for hospitals that receive generous
support from state or local government for providing uncom-
pensated care. Prior studies9-13 have found that hospitals in
states with Medicaid expansion experienced larger increases
in Medicaid-covered discharges and reductions in patients
without insurance compared with hospitals in states without
Medicaid expansion. In addition, a recent study found an as-
sociation between Medicaid expansion and reductions in un-
compensated care costs.14
The objective of this study was to determine if there was
an association nationwide between Medicaid expansion and
hospitals’uncompensated care costs, Medicaid revenue, and
profitability by using hospitals in states that did not expand
Medicaid as a comparison group against which to assess
changes in hospitals in states that expanded Medicaid.
Methods
This study examined changes from fiscal year 2011 through
2014 in uncompensated care costs, uncompensated care costs
as a percentage of total hospital expenses, Medicaid revenue,
Medicaidrevenueasapercentageoftotalhospitalrevenue,op-
erating margins, and excess margins (Box).15 The Medicaid ex-
pansion (effective January 1, 2014) provided a natural control
group for this analysis. This analysis also explored if hospi-
tals with high exposure to Medicaid expansion (defined by the
state’
s baseline uninsurance rate) had a different response to
the expansion compared with hospitals with low exposure
to Medicaid expansion.
Data
This analysis used data from the American Hospital Associa-
tion Annual Survey merged with the US Centers for Medicare
& Medicaid Services Health Care Cost Report Information
System (HCRIS). This study took into account the fact that
hospitals have different fiscal year reporting periods. All fis-
cal years were defined based on the calendar year end date
(eg, fiscal year 2014 included all observations in which the
fiscal year ended on January 31, 2014, or later). The data from
the American Hospital Association provided information on
hospitals’organizational characteristics. The HCRIS contains
annual cost reports submitted by all Medicare-certified hos-
pitals and provides hospital financial information with which
to construct key financial measures.
The HCRIS has known limitations with item nonresponse
and data quality, although it is widely used by the govern-
ment and many other entities to track critical components of
hospitals’finances. To improve the quality of the data, some
erroneously reported values were coded as missing, which
has been done by others.16 Of 14 754 observations at 3914
hospitals, there were 316 observations with missing values
for uncompensated care costs, 288 for Medicaid revenue, 111
for operating margins, and 285 for excess margins. The num-
ber of missing values included observations with item nonre-
sponse or erroneously reported values.

or high uninsurance rates prior to the ACA coverage expan-

rates of uninsured adults were the states with baseline unin-

The Urban Institute’
s institutional review board did not re-
quire review of this study because this research did not in-
volve personally identifiable information from participants.
Population
The main study sample included nonfederal general medical
or surgical hospitals in fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year 2014.
Because this study focused on the 2014 Medicaid expansion,
the study sample excluded hospitals in Massachusetts and 5
states (California, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey, and
Key Points
Question What is the association between the 2014 Medicaid
expansion established by the Affordable Care Act and hospitals’
uncompensated care costs, Medicaid revenue, and financial
margins?
Findings In this observational study, Medicaid expansion was
associated with significant declines in uncompensated care costs
and increases in Medicaid revenue in 2014 among hospitals in 19
states that expanded Medicaid compared with hospitals in 25
states that did not expand Medicaid. Hospitals in states that
expanded Medicaid also had better financial margins.
Meaning There may be financial benefits for hospitals in states
that implement Medicaid expansion, although further study is
needed to assess longer-term implications of this policy change.

Washington) and the District of Columbia that extended Med-
icaid eligibility before January 2014 to low-income adults
through a separate provision of the ACA. The sample also ex-
cluded hospitals with financial data that did not reflect 12
months of the fiscal year, observations with missing values for
a given outcome, and observations with $0 reported for un-
compensated care and Medicaid revenue models. For sensi-
tivity analyses, the sample was limited to only the subset of
hospitals that provided data for all 4 fiscal years.
Hospitals in 19 states that expanded Medicaid eligibility
in early 2014 constituted the exposure group and hospitals in
states that did not expand Medicaid comprised the compari-
son group. Michigan (which expanded Medicaid on April 1,
2014) was included in the exposure group and New Hamp-
shire (which expanded Medicaid on August 15, 2014) was in-
cluded in the comparison group.1 The overall findings were not
sensitive to this decision or to the study sample exclusions.
Statistical Analysis
This analysis used multivariable difference-in-difference
models to estimate changes in outcomes associated with the
ACA. Separate models were estimated for each outcome mea-
sure listed in the Methods section. Models included hospital
fixed effects, a set of fiscal year–specific dummy variables,
and a random error term. Robust standard errors were clus-
tered at the hospital level to correct for possible heterosce-
dasticity and autocorrelation.
The primary exposure variable was a term for the interac-
tion between whether the hospital was located in a Medicaid
expansion state and the share of the fiscal year that the hos-
pital was exposed to the 2014 Medicaid expansion. For ex-
ample, if a hospital’
s 2014 fiscal year overlapped with 75% of
calendar year 2014 (eg, hospitals with fiscal years that end on
September 30, 2014), this variable would be equal to 0.75 for
hospitals in states with Medicaid expansion during fiscal year
2014. Therefore, the regression results represent the associa-
tion between the Medicaid expansion and each outcome for a
full year of exposure rather than the descriptive data that rep-
resent partial exposure.
Models also included a set of hospital-level controls that
couldvaryovertimeandthatcouldinfluenceeachfinancialout-
come.Theseincludedhospitalownershiptype,size,systemsta-
tus, the provision of substance abuse services, the provision of
burn services,17 urban or rural status, and the percentage of the
county that was unemployed in which the hospital was lo-
cated. Hospitals were classified into a set of 5 distinct groups
of health system types that share common strategic and struc-
tural features based on prior research using existing theory and
data from the American Hospital Association.18 All estimates
were unweighted to reflect changes in mean values associated
with the sample of hospitals.
The same difference-in-difference technique was applied
tothemainsamplesplitintogroupsbasedonhighandlowbase-
line uninsurance rates. For the high baseline uninsured model,
thechangesinoutcomesamonghospitalslocatedinstateswith
Medicaidexpansionandhighratesofuninsuredresidentswere
compared with hospitals in states without Medicaid expan-
sion and high rates of uninsured residents. The high baseline
model includes states with uninsurance rates above the me-
dian.Forthelowbaselineuninsuredmodel,thechangesinout-
comes among hospitals located in states with Medicaid expan-
sion and low rates of uninsured residents were compared with
hospitals in states without Medicaid expansion and low rates
of uninsured residents. The low baseline model includes states
with uninsurance rates below the median.
Various robustness and sensitivity models were also esti-
mated. First, to formally test for differences in trends be-
tween hospitals in states with Medicaid expansion and those
states without expansion prior to 2014, models were esti-
mated on the pre-2014 data and included interactions be-
tween each year and the Medicaid expansion state indicator.
Second,uncompensatedcarecostsandMedicaidrevenuewere
log-transformed because the distribution of the untrans-
formed variables are heavily skewed. Third, to allow nonlin-
ear relationships with the key explanatory variable, the model
included dummy variables for postexpansion periods of less
than 4 months, 4 to 6 months, 7 to 9 months, and 10 to 12
months of exposure to calendar year 2014.
A 2-sided P value of less than .05 was considered statisti-
cally significant. Analyses were conducted using Stata ver-
sion 13.0 (StataCorp).

Hospital Characteristics
The sample included between 1200 and 1400 hospitals per fis-
calyearin19stateswithMedicaidexpansionandbetween2200
and 2400 hospitals per fiscal year in 25 states without Medic-
aid expansion after excluding approximately 600 hospitals in
Box. Definitions of Hospital Financial Terms
1. Uncompensated care costs: the sum of charity care costs and
the costs of non-Medicare and nonreimbursable Medicare bad
debt expenses reported by each hospital.
2. Net Medicaid revenue: inpatient and outpatient payments
received from Medicaid-covered services, including
disproportionate share payments, supplemental payments,
payments for an expanded Children’
s Health Insurance
Program, and payments from Medicaid managed care.
3. Operating margin: a ratio that measures the profitability
of hospitals when looking at the performance of primary
activities related to patient care. It is calculated as: [(net patient
revenue − total operating expenses) ÷ net patient revenue]
a. Net patient revenue: inpatient and outpatient revenues less
allowances and discounts on patient accounts.
b. Operating expenses: expenses incurred during the ordinary
course of operating the hospital, including general service
costs, inpatient routine service costs, ancillary service costs,
outpatient service costs, other reimbursable costs, special
purpose costs, and nonreimbursable costs.
4. Excess margin: a broader profitability indicator that includes all
other sources of income (eg, income from investments,
donations, parking lot receipts), not just those from patient
care. It is calculated as: [(net patient revenue − total operating
expenses + total other income) ÷ (net patient revenue + total
other income)]

prior to the Medicaid expansion effective date (eTable 1 in the
Supplement). However, from fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year
2014, the mean annual uncompensated care costs declined by
$2.0 million (95% CI, −$3.3 to −$0.7 million) among hospitals
in states with Medicaid expansion, and increased by $180 000
(95% CI, −$1.3 to $1.7 million) among hospitals in states with-
out Medicaid expansion (Figure 1). Uncompensated care costs
as a percentage of total expenses declined by 1.1 percentage
points (95% CI, −1.4 to −0.8 percentage points) among expan-
sion states but declined by only 0.1 percentage points (95% CI,
−0.4 to 0.1 percentage points) among states without Medicaid
expansion during this same period.

After Medicaid expansion, both operating and excess mar-
gins increased among hospitals in states with Medicaid expan-
sion and decreased among hospitals in states without Medic-
aid expansion. Operating margins in states with Medicaid
expansion improved by 0.8 percentage points (95% CI, −0.4 to

fiscal year 2013 to −6.2% (95% CI, −7.2% to −5.2%) in fiscal year

trends among states with or without Medicaid expansion were
consistent with those observed for operating margins.

The expansion of Medicaid was also significantly related
to an increase in Medicaid revenue. In adjusted analyses, ex-
pansion was associated with a mean annual increase in
Medicaid revenue per hospital of $3.2 million (95% CI, $0.9-
$5.6 million; P = .008) and an increase of 2.5 percentage points
(95% CI, 1.9-3.1 percentage points; P < .001) in Medicaid rev-
enue as a percent of total revenue. Compared with the base-
line mean of $27.9 million among hospitals in states with Med-
icaid expansion, the $3.2 million increase represents an
estimated 11.6% increase in Medicaid revenue.

contributed data throughout the study period, findings were
consistent with the main model (Table 3). In most instances,
the estimates were slightly larger in magnitude and more pre-
cise compared with the estimates in the main model. When
the sample was split into states with low vs high baseline rates
of uninsured residents, the estimated associations with the
Medicaid expansion were larger in states with high uninsur-
ance rates prior to the ACA (Table 4). When exposure to the

2014 expansion was treated as a categorical rather than linear
predictor, hospitals in states with greater exposure to Medic-
aid expansion still experienced sequentially larger declines in
uncompensated care and larger increases in Medicaid rev-
enue (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Log-transformed differ-
ence-in-differenceestimateswerealsoconsistentwiththemain
model, suggesting that the analyses were not biased by skewed
data or potential outliers (eTable 4 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In this analysis, Medicaid expansion was associated with sub-
stantial changes in payer mix. Hospitals in states with Medic-
aid expansion experienced reductions in uncompensated care
costs and increases in Medicaid revenue compared with hos-
pitals in states without Medicaid expansion. These findings
were accentuated for hospitals located in states with high rates
of uninsured adult residents prior to the ACA.
Medicaid expansion also was associated with improve-
ments in hospitals’financial margins; however, the estimates
were less precise and robust compared with the other find-
ings. This is not surprising given the various factors that can
influence the overall profitability of hospitals. Increases in
overall net patient revenue for hospitals in states with Medic-
aid expansion relative to states without Medicaid expansion
could be smaller than the differential change in net patient
revenue from Medicaid. For example, hospitals in states
without Medicaid expansion could have experienced a larger
increase in private insurance revenue from enrollees in Mar-
ketplace plans relative to hospitals in states with Medicaid
expansion. Relatedly, increases in hospital profitability in
states with Medicaid expansion could have been smaller than
expected if those states provided generous subsidies for
uncompensated care at baseline or had particularly low Med-
icaid reimbursements.
ForstatesstillconsideringMedicaidexpansion,thesefind-
ings suggest that expansion may be associated with improve-
ments in hospitals’payer mix and overall financial outlook.
However, changes in financial outcomes for hospitals in any
specific state will likely depend on a host of factors, such as
the state’
s pre-ACA income and coverage distribution, Medic-
aid eligibility thresholds, Medicaid reimbursement levels, and
the subsidies hospitals receive for providing uncompensated
care. For example, the ACA is expected to substantially re-
duce Medicaid Disproportionate Share payments to hospitals
in fiscal year 2018, which provide additional funding to help
cover uncompensated care in qualifying hospitals that serve
a large number of Medicaid and uninsured individuals. These
reductions were developed to help offset some of the federal
costs associated with Medicaid expansion, with the idea that
the costs would be replaced with Medicaid revenues from
newly eligible beneficiaries. However, states that have cho-
sen not expand Medicaid will be subject to cuts in this fund-
ing source without the offsetting benefit of an influx of new
Medicaid patients.19 The financial gap between hospitals in
states with Medicaid expansion and those without expan-
sion could further increase if current policy remains the same.
The findings of this study are consistent with a recent re-
port by Dranove et al14 that found uncompensated care de-
clined by 1.32 percentage points of operating margins for hos-
pitalsatthemedianinstatesthatexpandedMedicaidcompared
with little or no change among hospitals in states without Med-
icaid expansion. However, that study focused exclusively on
uncompensatedcarecosts,didnotexploretherelationshipbe-
tween the Medicaid expansion and changes in profit mar-
gins, and was restricted to hospitals (n = 1249) that submit-
tedaMedicarecostreportthatcoveredexactlyJanuary1,2014,
through December 31, 2014, which eliminated 64% of hospi-
tals in the remaining sample.
The present study has several limitations. First, the HCRIS
has some well-known data quality problems, including miss-
ing values and erroneously reporting information for certain
measures; this was addressed by replacing some implausible
values with missing, though other strategies would also be
reasonable.16,20 The difference-in-difference analysis also re-
duces potential biases due to accounting or reporting errors,
assuming such errors did not emerge differentially between
hospitals in both states with and without Medicaid expan-
sion after 2013. Second, even though this analysis used the
most recent data available, it did not capture the full calendar
year exposure to the January 1, 2014, Medicaid expansion. Fu-
ture research should assess the Medicaid expansion over a lon-
ger time frame and explore additional distributional patterns
associated with the expansion.
Conclusions
The hospitals located in the 19 states that implemented the
Medicaid expansion had significantly increased Medicaid rev-
enue, decreased uncompensated care costs, and improve-
ments in profit margins compared with hospitals located in the
25statesthatdidnotexpandMedicaid.Furtherstudyisneeded

pitals’overall finances.
