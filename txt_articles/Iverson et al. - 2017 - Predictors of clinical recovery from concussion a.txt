AbstrAct
Objective A systematic review of factors that might 
be associated with, or influence, clinical recovery from 
sport-related concussion. Clinical recovery was defined 
functionally as a return to normal activities, including 
school and sports, following injury.
Design Systematic review.
Data sources PubMed, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, 
Cochrane Library, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, Scopus and 
Web of Science.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Studies 
published by June of 2016 that addressed clinical 
recovery from concussion.
results A total of 7617 articles were identified using 
the search strategy, and 101 articles were included. There 
are major methodological differences across the studies. 
Many different clinical outcomes were measured, such 
as symptoms, cognition, balance, return to school and 
return to sports, although symptom outcomes were the 
most frequently measured. The most consistent predictor 
of slower recovery from concussion is the severity of a 
person’s acute and subacute symptoms. The development 
of subacute problems with headaches or depression 
is likely a risk factor for persistent symptoms lasting 
greater than a month. Those with a preinjury history of 
mental health problems appear to be at greater risk for 
having persistent symptoms. Those with attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or learning disabilities do 
not appear to be at substantially greater risk. There is 
some evidence that the teenage years, particularly high 
school, might be the most vulnerable time period for 
having persistent symptoms—with greater risk for girls 
than boys.
conclusion The literature on clinical recovery from 
sport-related concussion has grown dramatically, is 
mostly mixed, but some factors have emerged as being 
related to outcome.
IntrODuctIOn
Concussions can have large adverse effects on 
cognitive functioning and balance in the first 
24 
hours following injury.1 2 Injured athletes report 
diverse physical, cognitive and emotional symp-
toms during the first week following injury,1 2 and 
a greater number and severity of symptoms after a 
concussion are predictors of a slower recovery.3–6 
There is tremendous interest in identifying factors 
that might influence outcome from sport-related 
concussion.1 7–18
For most injured athletes, cognitive deficits,11 19 
balance20 21 and symptoms21 improve rapidly during 
the first 2 
weeks following injury. The return to 
 
play timeframe is often reported to be within 
 
10 days.20 22–26 However, this tends to be based on 
group-level findings only, not clinical outcomes 
from individual athletes, and group statistical anal-
yses can obscure subgroup results and individual 
differences. Some athletes might return to play 
while still symptomatic,27 28 well before clinical 
recovery. During the past 10 years, there has also 
been accumulating evidence suggesting that a size-
able minority of high school and collegiate athletes 
take much longer than 10 days to clinically recover 
and return to sports.29–31
The longer recovery times might partially reflect 
changes in the medical management of concus-
sion,32 33 with adoption of the gradual return to play 
recommendations from the Concussion in Sport 
Group statements from the conferences in Prague34 
and Zurich.35 36 These return to play recommen-
dations include no same-day return to play and 
a sequential progression through a series of steps 
prior to medical clearance for return to sports. In 
contrast, from 1995 to 1997, 31% of concussed 
high school and collegiate athletes returned to 
play during the same game that they sustained a 
concussion.28 Those sustaining grade 1 concussions 
returned on average 4 
days following injury and 
those sustaining grade 2 concussions returned, on 
average, 8 
days following injury.28
However, the translation of the Prague and 
Zurich return-to-play recommendations into clin-
ical practice has likely been gradual. There is clear 
evidence that from 2005 to 2008 many concussed 
high school athletes in the USA were returned to 
play prematurely, in a manner not consistent with 
the practice recommendations.37 Studies conducted 
in the past few years seem to reflect a change in 
clinical management. For example, in a study 
conducted between 2012 and 2014, of the 1429 
concussions reported among youth, high school 
and college-level athletes, 3.1% returned to play 
within 24 
hours of injury.38
At present, it is reasonable to conclude that the 
large majority of injured athletes recover, from a 
clinical perspective, within the first month following 
injury.39–43 Neurobiological recovery might extend 
beyond clinical recovery in some athletes.44–47 
Clinicians know that some student athletes report 
persistent symptoms for many months following 
injury, there can be multiple causes for those 
 
symptoms and those individuals are more likely 
to be included in studies conducted at specialty 
clinics.48 49
A range of preinjury individual differences, initial 
injury severity indicators, acute clinical effects or 
subacute clinical effects or comorbidities might

influence outcome from concussion. Genetics,50 sex differences,1 
16 18 51–53 younger age,1 7 12 38 54 neurodevelopmental factors such 
as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)55 56 or learning 
disability,57 personal57 or family history of migraine,58 or a 
personal14 58 or family history of mental health problems58 might 
also be predictors or effect modifiers of clinical recovery from 
concussion. Having a past concussion is a risk factor for having 
a future concussion,59 and having multiple past concussions is 
associated with having more physical, cognitive and emotional 
symptoms prior to participation in a sporting season.60 61 There 
have been inconsistent findings regarding whether specific injury 
severity characteristics, such as loss of consciousness, retrograde 
amnesia or post-traumatic amnesia, are associated with greater 
acute effects or prolonged recovery.5 15 56 62 Numerous postinjury 
clinical factors, such as the initial severity of cognitive deficits,4 
63 64 the development of post-traumatic headaches or migraines,5 
65 experiencing dizziness,48 66 difficulties with oculomotor func-
tioning48 and experiencing symptoms of depression,67 have also 
been associated with worse outcomes after concussion.
There is a need to synthesise evidence regarding the relation-
ship between demographic and clinical preinjury, injury-related 
and postinjury factors and clinical recovery after concussion. 
Therefore, this systematic review will assess numerous factors 
that might be considered intermediary, effect modifying, 
predictor or confounding variables in relation to clinical 
recovery from concussion. Clinical recovery is defined function-
ally as a return to normal activities, including school and sports, 
following injury. Operationally, it encompasses a resolution 
of postconcussive symptoms and a return to clinically normal 
balance and cognitive functioning.
MEthODs
The review protocol was prospectively registered in the 
PROSPERO database for systematic reviews (protocol ID: 
CRD42016041479). The broad initial review questions 
provided by the scientific leadership committee of the Concus-
sion in Sport Group were: (1) What are the key modifiers of 
concussion outcomes? (2) What factors are associated with a 
poorer prognosis or future risk following concussion? (3) How 
do we best quantify the role of these modifiers? (4) How many 
concussions are too many? (5) How do sex differences impact 
concussion management? Given the breadth of the initial ques-
tions, we narrowed the focus of this review to predictors of 
clinical outcome.
We defined outcome as ‘clinical recovery and return to activ-
ities and sports’. We examined different types of predictor 
variables. Effect modification occurs when the magnitude of 
the effect of concussion on clinical recovery (ie, the association) 
differs depending on the level of a third variable (ie, the effect 
modifier variable). Intermediary variables are factors involved 
in the causal pathway between exposure (injury) and outcome 
(clinical recovery). Confounding variables are factors inde-
pendently associated with the outcome (clinical recovery), and 
independently associated with the exposure (concussion), but 
they are not involved in the causal pathway between exposure 
and outcome. Confounding variables have a bidirectional asso-
ciation with both the exposure (concussion) and the outcome 
(clinical recovery).
search strategy
Articles were retrieved via online database searching, hand-
searching reference lists and performing cited reference 
searches (see figure 1). We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, 
MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, SPORT-
Discus, Scopus and Web of Science for articles published in 
English, from database inception to June 2016. Two general 
categories relating to (1) sport and athlete-related terms and 
(2) brain concussion-related terms were used as key search 
terms (refer to PROSPERO online registration (protocol ID: 
CRD42016041479), or see the online supplementary table, at 
the end of the table, for the specific search terms used). The 
search strategy initially included terms relating to imaging and 
biomarkers. However, after the search, these neuroimaging 
studies (as well as the results of serum biomarker studies) were 
determined to be beyond the scope of this review. The refer-
ence lists of articles retrieved for inclusion in the review were 
hand searched to identify other relevant articles. Key articles 
retrieved via online databases and through hand-searching 
reference lists were also used for further searches using the 
Web of Science Cited Reference function.
Article selection
Two reviewers conducted the initial screening of the titles 
and abstracts of articles identified in the search. We included 
articles that examined factors that may be associated with 
outcome from concussion and were conducted with humans. 
We excluded articles that addressed acute outcome in the 
initial days following injury, but did not address clinical 
recovery time or risk for persistent symptoms. Where there 
was uncertainty about whether a study should be included 
based on the review of the title and abstract, the full article 
was retrieved. To supplement the electronic database search, 
we examined the reference lists from previously published 
reviews and systematic reviews and the published abstracts 
that were presented as posters and oral presentations at the 
Fifth Conference on Concussion in Sport in Berlin in October 
of 2016.
Data extraction
For the included articles, all authors participated in the 
extraction of the first author, year of publication, the PubMed 
identification number, number of participants, proportion 
of female participants, age, setting, clinical outcome, predic-
tors that were significant, predictors that were not significant 
and the period for assessing the clinical outcome. The level 
of evidence was rated using the Oxford Classification for 
Evidence-Based Medicine. Two or three reviewers inde-
pendently extracted data from and rated each article. A third 
reviewer was sometimes needed to resolve discrepancies. 
Studies were sorted based on the specific predictor variables 
that were analysed.
rEsults
We found 7617 articles in the database search (figure 1). After 
duplicates were removed, 4777 were screened further by title 
and abstract for eligibility. Of the 4777 articles, 4537 were 
excluded on the basis that they did not examine athletes who 
had sustained a sports concussion, or the citation was not an 
original study (ie, the citation was a review article, editorial, 
letter to the editor or commentary). The PDFs of 240 arti-
cles were retrieved and reviewed. We included 101 articles 
and 13 abstracts from the Berlin Concussion in Sport Confer-
ence for review (figure 1). In the online supplementary table 
and in boxes 1–3, we report variables that had a significant 
independent association with outcome. There were major 
methodological differences across the studies (see online

below.
 
►
Research designs were diverse, including retrospective, 
prospective, 
case–control, 
inception 
cohort 
and 
epidemiological studies.
 
►
Many different clinical outcomes were measured, including 
symptoms, cognition, balance, return to school and return 
to sports.
 
►
There was considerable variability in when outcomes were 
measured.
 
►
The setting in which the study was conducted also likely 
influenced outcomes; recovery times were faster in studies 
conducted in educational institutions21 53 compared with 
emergency departments57 68 or specialty clinics.69
summary of relationship between clinical recovery after 
concussion and preinjury, injury-related and postinjury factors
We extracted statistically significant predictors as well as 
predictors that were not significantly different (see online 
supplementary table). Some studies examined single variables, 
such as age70 71 or sex.31 52 72 73 Most studies, however, exam-
ined multiple variables. In the online supplementary table and 
in boxes 1–3, we report variables that had a significant inde-
pendent association with outcome. It is important to appreciate 
that when multivariable analyses are conducted, many univariate 
significant findings drop out.56 57 68 For example, Zemek and 
colleagues found 47 variables that were independently associated 
with persistent symptoms after 1 
month, but in multivariable 
analyses only nine remained significant predictors.57

review
Numerous studies have reported that younger age is associated 
with worse outcome, whereas many have not (see box 1). Age 
effects were examined statistically in different ways across the 
studies. Moreover, some studies reporting no age effects some-
times had fairly restricted age ranges.74–77 There were, however, 
large studies that did not find meaningful age effects.21 78 Prior 
studies have usually shown a gradient effect, with professional 
athletes returning to sports faster than collegiate athletes, then 
followed by high school athletes. Some recent studies have not 
shown a difference in recovery time between high school and 
collegiate athletes, however.21 78 Many studies have reported 
an association between female sex and worse clinical outcome 
(see box 1). A comparable number of studies have not reported 
significant sex differences in outcomes. However, large-scale 
observational studies indicate that girls and young women are 
at greater risk for having symptoms that persist for more than a 
month.57 79 80
Many studies have found an association between prior 
concussions and worse clinical outcome, but it is interesting 
to note that a greater number of studies have not found this 
association (box 1). Several studies have examined the associ-
ation between mental health history and outcome, with nearly 
all showing an association with worse outcome. Most research 
to date does not support an association between ADHD or 
learning disabilities and clinical outcome. Nearly all studies 
do not show an association between a personal history of 
migraine and worse clinical outcomes (box 1). However, one 
large multisite prospective study reported that a history of 
migraine was associated with risk for symptoms lasting more 
than 4 weeks.57 There was consistent evidence that acute and

review
subacute postinjury headaches were associated with worse clin-
ical outcomes (box 3).
Some studies have reported that loss of consciousness is 
associated with worse clinical outcome, but most have not 
(box 2). Similarly, some studies have reported that ‘amnesia’ 
and post-traumatic amnesia are associated with worse clinical 
outcomes after concussion, but most studies have reported nega-
tive findings (box 2). There was strong evidence of a relationship 
between acute or subacute symptom burden and worse clinical 
outcome, although a few studies have not found this association 
(box 3).
DIscussIOn
Most children, adolescents and young adults who experience a 
sport-related concussion will recover, from a clinical perspective, 
within 1 
month.39 41–43 132 However, it is important to appreciate 
that the subgroup of children and adolescents who are taken to 
the emergency department following a sport-related concussion 
is at much greater risk for symptoms lasting beyond a month.57 68 
In a multisite Canadian study, 30% of these children and adoles-
cents reported persistent symptoms after 4 
weeks.57 Both within 
and beyond the first month following injury, it is well under-
stood in research and clinical practice that there are individual 
differences in recovery trajectories. In general, the literature is 
complex, mixed and difficult to interpret definitively.
six key considerations when interpreting this review
1. There are baseline (preinjury) differences in student 
athletes’ experiences with, and reporting of, concussion-like 
symptoms, and these baseline differences can complicate our 
understanding of the relationships between predictors and 
clinical outcome. Prior to injury, girls and young women 
report more symptoms than boys and young men in most 
studies.10 60 People with pre-existing developmental or health 
problems, such as ADHD,60 133–135 learning problems,60 134 135 
a history of mental health60 or substance abuse problems,60 
a history of treatment for headaches61 or migraines,60 or 
multiple prior concussions60 61 129 report more symptoms 
than people who do not have these conditions.
2. Student athletes with ADHD133 136–139 or learning problems136 
have a greater lifetime history of concussion, and individuals 
with a prior history of concussion are at increased risk for a

future concussion.59 There might be important interactions 
between neurodevelopmental problems, multiple prior 
concussions and clinical recovery from a future concussion. 
In large-scale multivariate analyses of baseline preseason 
symptom reporting in adolescents, past concussion history 
is a significant predictor of baseline symptoms, but the 
magnitude of its relationship to symptom reporting is less 
than the factors such as ADHD, past mental health problems 
and a personal history of migraine.60 61
3. Student athletes with no known developmental or health 
problems, and no prior history of concussion, also report some 
non-specific concussion-like symptoms in their daily lives.60 
These symptoms can be related to stress,140 depression,141 
insufficient sleep141–143 and a variety of other factors.
4. The results for nearly all the potential predictors are mixed, 
and for the most-often studied predictors (eg, age, sex and 
prior concussion history) there are many studies that do not 
show a significant association. The quality of included studies 
was variable, and the methodologies varied considerably, and 
this might influence the strength of evidence. We suggest not 
simply relying on a summary count of the number of studies 
in boxes 1–3 that showed an association versus not, because 
the studies varied tremendously in when and how they 
measured outcomes, in sample sizes and statistical power, 
sport population representativeness and methodological 
quality (see online supplementary table for details regarding 
the methodological differences in these studies).
5. Extracting non-significant findings from empirical studies 
can be difficult because authors often emphasise significant 
findings and do not always report negative findings. It was not 
always clear whether a predictor was statistically examined 
and whether it was a negative finding. Therefore, it is likely 
that the number of negative findings presented in the boxes 
is an underestimate (ie, there is a risk for publication bias).
6. Many past studies on the topic of predictors examine 
athletes only in the first 1–2 weeks following injury. In 
recent years, there have been quite a few studies that have 
examined predictors of those who are slow to recover and 
have persistent symptoms beyond a month.
relationship between age and clinical recovery
Age is one of the most frequently studied preinjury demo-
graphic and health factors that might be related to outcome. 
There is some, but not definitive, support for a gradient age 
and level of play effect with clinical recovery being fastest in 
professional athletes, followed by college athletes, followed by 
high school athletes. In a large prospective multicentre study57 
of children and adolescents presenting to the emergency depart-
ment, the rates of those having persistent symptoms beyond 
4 weeks, stratified by age group, were as follows: 5–7=17.9%, 
8–12=26.3% and 13–17=39.9%. This suggests that the 
teenage and high school years might represent the greatest age 
period of vulnerability for slow recovery. However, younger 
children have less ability to conceptualise and verbalise their 
symptoms—whereas teenagers have an emerging ability to think 
more abstractly and they have a greater vocabulary for symp-
toms—so part of the difference in symptom rates might actually 
reflect developmental differences in how children and adoles-
cents experience and report symptoms. Adolescents might also 
be more vulnerable to the social psychological effects of having 
sustained a sport-related concussion or have different motiva-
tional factors influencing their recovery. More research in these 
areas is needed.
relationship between sex and clinical recovery
The literature on recovery time and persistent symptoms is 
mixed, but overall supports that females, on average, take longer 
to recover—and they are more likely to have symptoms that 
persist for more than a month.49 56 57 68 Sex differences, such as 
differences in neck strength,144–147 injury biomechanics148 and 
injury rates149 in females compared with males, and the fact that 
women report more symptoms, as a group, both before and after 
sustaining an injury,10 might help to account for this finding.
relationship between history of concussion and clinical 
recovery
Prior history of concussions was not related to clinical outcome 
after concussion in most studies. However, because prior history 
of concussion is a risk factor for future concussions,59 prior 
concussions are associated with greater preinjury symptom 
reporting in some athletes,60 61 and some large-scale studies show 
an association between concussion history and increased risk for 
symptoms lasting more than 4 
weeks,48 56 57 we consider concus-
sion history an important variable. More research is needed 
to determine whether the risk for future concussion is greater 
primarily in those who had slower recovery from a past concus-
sion.57
relationship between neurodevelopmental disorders, mental 
health, migraine and clinical recovery
Children with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as ADHD 
and learning disabilities, have a greater lifetime history of 
concussion,136 150 perform more poorly, as a group, on neuro-
psychological testing134 135 139 and report more concussion-like 
symptoms in their daily lives,60 133–135 in the absence of injury. 
The literature to date suggests that those with ADHD or learning 
problems may have different baseline scores on symptom and 
neurocognitive measures but they are not clearly at greater risk 
for worse outcome or slow recovery following injury.
Preinjury mental health problems,58 particularly depression,57 
68 are a risk factor for persistent symptoms in a small number 
of studies. A preinjury history of migraine was not related to 
outcome in most studies, but it was related in one large multi-
centre, prospective, well-powered study.57 Studies typically rely 
on self-reported headache history on a questionnaire, and many 
adolescents and young adults might have difficulty differenti-
ating ‘headache’ from ‘migraine’, which could contribute to the 
mixed findings. Acute and subacute postinjury headaches of any 
type are a risk factor for persistent symptoms in some studies. 
Therefore, having a history of migraine might confer increased 
risk for slower recovery, but more research is needed to defini-
tively establish this association.
relationship between surrogate measures of injury severity 
and clinical recovery
There is a long-standing interest in whether injury severity 
factors, such as loss of consciousness, retrograde amnesia and 
post-traumatic amnesia, are related to clinical outcome. The 
literature is mixed regarding these variables. Most concus-
sions are not demarcated by loss of consciousness,42 and loss 
of consciousness is not a strong predictor of outcome in most 
studies. Therefore, we consider it a weak predictor. Post-trau-
matic amnesia was not related to outcome in most studies. 
Retrograde amnesia has more consistently been associated with 
short-term outcome15 than loss of consciousness and post-trau-
matic amnesia, but fewer studies show an association between 
retrograde amnesia and slower recovery time.89 91 102

review
The initial injury severity indicators are less important than 
the early clinical consequences (ie, symptom burden) of the 
injury. Many studies have illustrated that greater severity of 
acute and subacute symptoms following injury are associated 
with slower recovery (see box 3). A small number of studies 
indicate that greater acute cognitive deficits are associated with 
slower recovery.63 119 These are intuitive findings because greater 
acute cognitive impairment likely reflects greater adverse effects 
of injury on neurobiology, and greater acute symptom reporting 
likely reflects the combined effects of neurobiology, adverse 
acute psychological reactions and greater preinjury propensity 
towards experiencing symptoms.
limitations
This systematic review has several methodological limita-
tions. First, we did not rate risk of bias or the methodological 
quality of the articles. We simply extracted details regarding 
the methodology, results and rated the level of evidence (online 
supplementary table). Second, there is a potential for publication 
bias in our conclusions because we only reviewed published arti-
cles; studies with negative findings are less likely to be published. 
Third, there is potential for language bias influencing our 
conclusions because we only included English language articles. 
Fourth, we could not pool data across studies and meta-analyse 
individual predictors or multiple predictors in combination. 
Finally, conducting a best evidence synthesis would have allowed 
us to better weight the quality of evidence when making overall 
summary statements about the relationship between individual 
predictor variables and clinical recovery.
cOnclusIOns
The strongest and most consistent predictor of slower recovery 
from concussion was greater severity of a person’s acute and 
subacute symptoms following injury. Having a low-level of symp-
toms in the first day or two following injury was a favourable 
prognostic indicator. The development of subacute problems 
with headaches or depression are likely risk factors for persistent 
symptoms lasting greater than a month. Children, adolescents 
and young adults with a preinjury history of mental health prob-
lems or migraine headaches appear to be at somewhat greater 
risk for having symptoms greater than 1 
month. Those with 
ADHD or learning disabilities might require more careful plan-
ning and intervention regarding returning to school, but they 
do not appear to be at substantially greater risk for persistent 
symptoms beyond a month. The teenage years, particularly high 
school, might be the most vulnerable time for having persistent 
symptoms—with greater risk for girls than boys.

What is already known?
 
► Concussions can have large adverse effects on cognitive 
functioning and balance in the first 24 hours following injury.
 
► Athletes report diverse physical, cognitive and emotional 
symptoms acutely and subacutely.
 
► A greater number and severity of symptoms after a 
concussion are predictors of a slower recovery in some 
studies.
 
► A large percentage of injured athletes recover clinically 
within 10 days, and the large majority appear to recover 
within 1 month.
 
► Injury severity characteristics, such as loss of consciousness, 
retrograde amnesia and post-traumatic amnesia are not 
consistent or strong predictors of recovery time in some 
studies.
What are the new findings?
 
► For the majority of predictors, the literature is mixed with 
positive and negative findings.
 
► Preinjury mental health problems and prior concussions 
appear to be risk factors for persistent symptoms.
 
► Greater acute and subacute symptoms are a consistent 
predictor of worse clinical outcome.
 
► The teenage years might be a particularly vulnerable time 
for having persistent symptoms—with greater risk for girls 
than boys.
