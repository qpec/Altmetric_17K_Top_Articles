Context: Obesity is associated with poor bone mineralization and quality. Fibroblast growth factor
23 (FGF23) plays an important role in skeletal physiology.
Objective: To test hypothesis that greater adiposity results in higher FGF23 levels among individuals
with normal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
Design, Setting, Participants: Cross-sectional analyses among participants with eGFR $60 mL/min/
1.73m2. We assessed the association between crude [body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC),
and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR); n = 5610] and refined (abdominal adipose tissue area by computed
tomography; n = 1313) measures of adiposity and FGF23 using multivariable linear regression.
Main Outcome Measure: Serum FGF23.
Results: FGF23 was higher across BMI categories (BMI ,25: 37.7; BMI 25 to 29.99: 38.7; BMI 30 to
39.99: 39.8; BMI $40: 40.9 pg/mL, unadjusted P trend , 0.0001). The association between BMI and
FGF23 was independent of known confounders of FGF23 (adjusted b = +7.2% higher FGF23 per
10 kg/m2; P , 0.0001). Similar results were observed using WC and WHR. Abdominal adipose tissue
area was also independently associated with higher FGF23 (P , 0.01). Notably, the positive
associations between FGF23 and adiposity were observed despite the fact that eGFR did not
decline and serum phosphate levels did not increase with adiposity.
Conclusion: In a large cohort with normal kidney function, adiposity was associated with higher
FGF23 levels independent of known confounders, including eGFR and phosphate. Further studies
are needed to evaluate the causes of higher FGF23 in settings of greater adiposity and the potential
impact on skeletal health. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 102: 1387–1395, 2017)

here is evidence that greater adiposity may be a risk
factor for poor skeletal health. This supposition is in
contrast to prior evidence that obesity may impart
protective skeletal effects as a result of factors such as
increased mechanical loading (1–3). In this regard, recent
data have shown that obese individuals, compared with

 normal weight individuals, may be at increased risk for
low-trauma extremity fractures, inferior bone quality, and
lower bone formation (4–9). The reason for these findings
is not well understood and is likely multifactorial; one key
element likely involves secondary hyperparathyroidism
and subsequent abnormal bone mineralization that stems
from a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (10, 11).
Several humoral factors that may link adipose tissue to
deleterious impacts on the skeleton have been noted,
including proinflammatory cytokines and adipocyto-
kines (12, 13). It is notable that adipocytes and osteo-
blasts share a common precursor, the pluripotent
mesenchymal stem cell, thereby providing a cellular link
between adiposity and skeletal homeostasis (14). Fibro-
blast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a key regulator of
phosphate and vitamin D metabolism and is a known
predictor of metabolic bone disease in chronic kidney
disease (CKD) (15–17). Although there is no direct evi-
dence that FGF23 is produced in adipose tissue, other
members of the FGF family (factors 19 and 21) are
expressed by adipocytes and may have roles in energy
regulation (18, 19). In addition, higher parathyroid
hormone (PTH) levels, which are commonly observed in
obesity, may promote higher FGF23 levels via direct
PTH action and/or indirectly via upregulation of 1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25OH2D) (20, 21). The actions
of FGF23 include inhibition of 1,25OH2D synthesis and
increase of phosphate excretion; therefore, excess FGF23
may interfere with bone mineralization by decreasing the
availability of calcium and phosphate substrates.
In non-CKD populations, higher FGF23 levels have been
associated with higher fracture risk (22), and two relatively
small studies have observed an independent association
between adiposity and higher FGF23 levels in non-CKD
individuals (23, 24). These studies have raised the question
of whether adipose tissue may promote an increase in
FGF23 levels. A major limitation of the aforementioned
studies was the incomplete assessment of notable regulators
of bone and mineral metabolism that may have affected
FGF23 and/or skeletal health, including PTH, vitamin D,
and serum and urinary calcium and phosphate.
In this context, we hypothesized that FGF23 may be
oversecreted in obesity and states of greater adiposity,
even in the setting of normal kidney function. We tested
this hypothesis by performing a cross-sectional study to
assess whether greater adiposity was significantly asso-
ciated with higher FGF23 levels, independent of other
known regulators of FGF23 and mineral metabolism. We
used crude measures of adiposity [body-mass index
(BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio
(WHR)], as well as more sensitive assessments of adi-
posity [abdominal adipose tissue area measured by
computed tomography (CT)], and accounted for the
influences of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR),
calcium and phosphate balance, 25-hydroxyvitamin D
(25OHD), and PTH.
Materials and Methods
Study population
The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is a
prospective cohort study of 6814 community-living adults ages
45 to 84 years, which was established to study risk factors and
progression of subclinical cardiovascular disease. Details of this
cohort have been previously published (25). Subjects were
recruited from six centers across the United States (New York,
New York; Baltimore, Maryland; Forsyth County, North
Carolina; Chicago, Illinois; St. Paul, Minnesota; and Los
Angeles, California). Institutional review boards approved the
study at all sites, and participants provided informed consent.
At the first MESA examination, conducted from 2000 to 2002,
6814 participants were included and underwent assessments of
demographic data, anthropometrics, medication use, and assess-
ments of serum and urinary calcium and phosphate, 25OHD, PTH,
and FGF23. For our current analyses, we included only those
participants with data available for all these relevant mineral me-
tabolites and excluded those with key data missing. Furthermore,
we excluded any participant who may have had potentially
unrecognized primary hyperparathyroidism (Ca .10.2 mg/dL
with PTH .65 pg/mL). Given that chronic kidney disease is a
strong predictor of FGF23, we excluded participants with an
eGFR,60mL/min/1.73m2toreduceconfounding.Afterexclusions,
the final sample size for this study was 5610 participants (Fig. 1).
Among this population of 5610, a subset of 1313 partici-
pants underwent abdominal CT with assessment of total, vis-
ceral, and subcutaneous adipose tissue areas, as previously
described (26). CT scans were performed during MESA ex-
aminations 2 or 3, which occurred between 2002 and 2005. We
excluded any participant who had missing data for the as-
sessments of total, subcutaneous, or visceral adipose area,
leaving a final sample size of 1313 participants who had CT
measurement and quantification of adipose tissue areas (Fig. 1).
Assessment of demographic and anthropometric
variables
Questionnaires and standardized interviews administered by
study coordinators were completed by all participants to obtain
demographic, medical history, and medication use data. Anthro-
pometric protocols were standard across sites (27). BMI was
calculated from weight and height measurements at examination1,
with participant BMI categorized by World Health Organization
categories 1 to 4 (1, BMI ,25; 2, BMI 25 to 29.99; 3, BMI 30 to
39.99; 4, BMI $40). WC was measured at the umbilicus, and
WHR was calculated with the addition of hip measurement, which
was measured at the widest circumference of the buttock.
Assessment of abdominal adipose tissue area by CT
Adipose tissue was identified as being between 2190 and
230 Hounsfield units. Measurement of specific adipose depot
areas was obtained by semiautomated segmentation of the body
compartments using Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and
Visualization software (MIPAV 4.1.2) provided by the National
Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). Adipose tissue areas were

 defined as the mean area (in cm2) of two CT slices, one at the
L3/L4 junction and the second just superior to the L3/L4
junction. Subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue areas were
calculated separately, as previously described with respect to the
MESA cohort (26). Total abdominal adipose tissue (TAAT)
area included subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) area, visceral
adipose tissue (VAT) area, and a small amount of intermuscular
adipose, collected during the same scan.
Laboratory measurements
All serum and urine samples at examination 1 were collected
after an overnight fast, in the morning before 10 AM, and stored
at 280°C prior to analysis. Serum intact FGF23 was measured
using the Kainos sandwich immunoassay (Kainos, Tokyo,
Japan), which measures the full-length (intact) FGF23 molecule
(28). The interassay coefficients of variation of standardized high-
and low-control samples were 6.7% and 12.4%, respectively (29).
Intact serum PTH concentrations were measured at the University
of Washington using the Beckman-Coulter Dx1 automated two-
site immunoassay (Beckman-Coulter, Brea, CA), with coefficients
of variation of 6.1% at 30.1 pg/mL and 3.4% at 94.5 pg/mL (30).
Annualized 25OHD measurements were estimated using a
cosinor model from single measurements to adjust for seasonal
variations in 25OHD to estimate year-long 25OHD status. This
model has been validated using longitudinal 25OHD measure-
ments within the MESA population, as previously described (31),
with low sample coefficient of variation of 11.8% at 24.8 ng/mL
and 8.5% at 7.0 ng/mL (31). Serum creatinine was used to es-
timate eGFR by the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI)
Equation (32). Serum and urinary calcium and serum and urinary
phosphate were measured as previously described (33). Fractional
excretion of phosphate was calculated from the serum and urinary
measures of phosphate and creatinine.
Statistical analysis
Our primary analysis assessed the association between BMI
and FGF23 levels (n = 5610). Secondary analyses using WC and
WHR, instead of BMI, were also performed; in addition, we
assessed the association of the more specific measure of adiposity
by CT measurements with FGF23 in the
subset of participants who had undergone
CT examination (n = 1313).
We describe all study variables as means
with standard deviations or counts with
percents. We compared the mean values
of FGF23 and other markers of mineral
metabolism across BMI categories and
quartiles of WC, WHR, and abdominal
adiposity

using

analysis. Multivariable linear regression
was used to assess the independent asso-
ciation between the predictors (BMI, WC,
WHR, and adipose tissue area as continu-
ous variables) and the outcome (FGF23)
with adjustments for relevant demographic
and socioeconomic covariates, as well as
notable regulators of bone and mineral
metabolism that may represent confounders
or predictors of FGF23. Model A included
adjustment for age, ethnicity, sex, eGFR,
urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, hyper-
tension status [yes (Y)/no (N), defined by guidelines from
the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Pre-
vention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood
Pressure (34)], use of antihypertensive medications (Y/N), di-
abetes status [defined as normal, impaired fasting glucose, or
diabetes on the basis of the 2003 American Diabetes Association
fasting criteria (35)], use of antidiabetic medications (Y/N),
education level (no schooling though grade 11, or completed
high school/through some college completed, or technical
school certificate through graduate/professional school degree),
cigarette smoking status (never, former, current), and physical
activity (reported physical activity hours per week). We adjusted for
both eGFR and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio to account for mild
forms of kidney dysfunction that may be present even with eGFR $
60. Model B included adjustment for variables in model A, as well as
the biochemical parameters of mineral metabolism: PTH, 25OHD,
serum calcium, and urinary calcium-to-creatinine ratio. Model C
adjusted for variables in models A and B, as well as serum phosphate
and urinary fractional excretion of phosphate. We considered models
B and C to be exploratory, given that some of these biochemical
parameters may be involved as mediators in a potential causal
pathway linking FGF23 with adiposity (especially phosphate
metabolism).UnivariaterelationshipsbetweencovariatesandFGF23
are shown in Supplemental Table 1. We also compared the mean
values of FGF23 and other markers of mineral metabolism by race/
ethnicity, and tested the interaction of both race/ethnicity and sex on
the association of adiposity with FGF23. FGF23 was not normally
distributed and therefore was log-transformed in linear regression
models. Beta coefficients were exponentiated and reported as percent
difference in FGF23 per specified unit of adiposity measure.
We used SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) for all
statistical analyses. A two-tailed P value of ,0.05 was used to
indicate statistical significance.

 28.2 (5.5) kg/m2 (Table 1). The mean concentrations were
as follows: FGF23 was 38.8 (16.6) pg/mL, 25OHD was
25.3 (10.9) ng/mL, PTH was 43.2 (18.1) pg/mL, calcium
and phosphate were 9.6 (0.4) mg/dL and 3.7 (0.5) mg/dL,
respectively, and eGFR was 82.0 (13.1) mL/min/1.73 m2.
The characteristics of the subset of participants who
underwent CT with abdominal adipose tissue area
measurements were similar to those of the total study
population (Table 1), although notably, there were
minor differences in racial distribution, diabetes status,
and values of BMI, WC, and WHR.
Crude measures of adiposity, FGF23, and
mineral metabolism
Higher BMI was associated with lower 25OHD,
lower serum calcium and urinary calcium excretion,
and higher PTH levels (Table 2). FGF23 levels were
significantly higher across BMI categories despite the
fact that eGFR did not decline (36) and serum phos-
phate did not increase. These findings were recapitulated
when examined across WC and WHR quartiles; higher
WC and WHR were associated with higher FGF23 de-
spite lower serum phosphate, higher fractional excretion
of phosphate, and no difference in eGFR (Supplemental
Tables 2 and 3).
We assessed the independent association between BMI
(as a continuous variable) and FGF23 levels. BMI was
positively associated with FGF23 levels, independent of
notable demographic and socioeconomic covariates, but
also independent of other regulators of FGF23 and bone
and mineral metabolism (Table 3). The fully adjusted
effect estimate suggests that for a 10 kg/m2 increase in
BMI, there is a 7.2% higher FGF23. The fully adjusted
(model C) R2 was 9%, and BMI accounted for 1.1% of
this variance. We observed a similar independent asso-
ciation between higher WC and WHR and higher FGF23
levels (Supplemental Table 4).
White ethnicity was associated with higher FGF23,
lower eGFR, and highest fractional excretion of phos-
phate than other ethnic groups (Supplemental Table 5).

 However, there was no significant heterogeneity between
BMI and FGF23 levels by race/ethnicity (Supplemental
Table 6). In addition, there was no significant hetero-
geneity between BMI and FGF23 levels by sex (Supple-
mental Table 7).
Abdominal adipose tissue area, FGF23, and mineral
metabolism
We repeated our investigations using the more refined
measures of abdominal adiposity obtained via CT.
Higher areas of TAAT were associated with higher BMI
(correlation r = 0.81) (Table 4). Notably, there were large
overlaps in the BMI ranges for each quartile of TAAT,
underscoring the discrepancy between abdominal adi-
posity measures by CT and the crude measure of BMI.
Higher TAAT was associated with lower 25OHD, lower
urinary calcium excretion, and higher PTH levels, again
suggesting a vitamin D deficiency and secondary hy-
perparathyroidism with higher adipose tissue burden.
FGF23 was again significantly higher with adiposity, and
this observation was despite the fact that serum phos-
phate levels were lower, fractional excretion of phosphate
was higher, and eGFR was no different with higher ab-
dominal adiposity (Table 4).
The independent association between TAAT (as a
continuous variable) and FGF23 levels was evaluated
using adjusted linear regression models. A positive as-
sociation between TAAT and FGF23 remained statisti-
cally significant following adjustment for important
confounders of FGF23 and bone and mineral meta-
bolism. In the fully adjusted model, there was a 3.1%
higher FGF23 per standard deviation of TAAT area
(Table 5). We also examined whether specific depots of
abdominal adipose tissue (SAT or VAT) may play a
specific role in this relationship and observed no sub-
stantial differences by adipose tissue type (Table 5).
Discussion
In a large community-based cohort with normal eGFR,
we observed significantly higher FGF23 levels with adi-
posity, as assessed by crude measures such as BMI, WC,
and WHR, as well as by more refined measurements with
abdominal CT. These observations were independent of
known determinants and confounders of FGF23. Low
eGFR and high phosphate levels are traditionally con-
sidered to stimulate FGF23; however, we observed that
eGFR did not decline and serum phosphate levels tended
to be lower with higher abdominal adiposity, suggesting
that higher FGF23 levels with greater degrees of adiposity

 may represent a novel regulation of FGF23 that is unique
from the traditional influences of kidney function and
phosphate balance.
FGF23 is a phosphaturic hormone that was initially
identified as a key regulator of phosphate metabolism
(37) and is most extensively understood and studied
within the context of CKD. FGF23 increases significantly
with declining eGFR and subsequent increases in serum
phosphate; its phosphaturic effect may be considered as
serving as a physiological “brake” on serum phosphate
accumulation. In addition to increasing renal phosphate
excretion, FGF23 also inhibits 1-a hydroxylase and
stimulates 24-hydroxlyase, acting to reduce activated
vitamin D (i.e., 1,25OH2D) concentrations. Given that
1,25OH2D enhances intestinal phosphate absorption,
FGF23 suppression of 1,25OH2D production leads to
further reductions in serum phosphate. Our observation
of normal eGFR and stable to lower serum phosphate
with higher adiposity would be expected to be associated
with lower FGF23. Therefore, our contrary finding of
higher FGF23 levels, despite these physiologic suppres-
sants, may suggest that the high adipose tissue milieu, or
adipose tissue itself, may induce increased secretion (or
decreased degradation) of FGF23. It is important to note
that in our non-CKD population, the observed changes in
FGF23 with adiposity were of a much smaller magnitude
than those seen in CKD (38), suggesting that the mech-
anisms for higher FGF23 with adiposity may be distinct
from those stimulating FGF23 in the setting of declining
eGFR.
There are several hypotheses for why FGF23 may be
higher with higher adiposity in a non-CKD population.

Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 and Adiposity

 Higher PTH levels as a result of secondary hyperpara-
thyroidism may stimulate 1-a hydroxylase, thereby in-
creasing 1,25OH2D production. FGF23 expression is
upregulated by 1,25OH2D (20); therefore, secondary
hyperparathyroidism in obesity may indirectly increase
FGF23 via its stimulation of 1,25OH2D production.
Moreover, there is evidence that PTH may directly
stimulate FGF23 production via PTH 1 receptor sig-
naling in whole bone and osteocytes, although these data
are limited to mouse models (21, 39).
Adipose tissue expresses and secretes numerous other
hormones that have been linked to FGF23 production
(40), providing other potential explanations for our
findings. It is notable that the other members of the FGF
family to which FGF23 belongs have been shown to be
produced in adipose tissue and have important roles in
energy metabolism; FGF21 is produced by adipocytes,
among other tissues (18), and contributes to thermo-
genesis and fatty acid storage (19). There are also po-
tential immunological roles of FGF23; its expression has
been noted in mouse thymus, as well as dendritic cells
and macrophages (41), which are increased in proin-
flammatory visceral adipose tissue. Furthermore, higher
levels of aldosterone have been described in over-
weight individuals (42) and those with higher VAT (43).
In a mouse model, administration of aldosterone in-
creased FGF23 transcription by osteoblasts (44); thus,
higher FGF23 with adiposity may also be related to
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system dysregulation. It is
notable that we did not find a significant difference in the
association of FGF23 with adiposity by specific adipose
depot (i.e., SAT vs VAT), in contrast with other studies
that have shown a more defined correlation between
skeletal disease and VAT (45). Lastly, leptin, which is
typically increased in obesity as a result of leptin re-
sistance, may play a role as well; in ob/ob mice, infusion
of leptin markedly increased bone FGF23 expres-
sion (46).
Whether higher FGF23 levels associated with adi-
posity have a clinical impact on skeletal health in obesity
is yet to be determined. It is plausible that higher FGF23
levels in obesity negatively affect bone health via in-
hibition of 1,25OH2D activity and promotion of phos-
phaturia, two actions that can result in a deficiency in
calcium and phosphate substrates that are needed for
bone mineralization. This, compounded by the miner-
alization defects related to higher PTH in obesity, may
provide a mechanism that explains adverse skeletal health
in this population.
Beyond skeletal health, evidence linking higher FGF23
levels with cardiovascular disease and mortality (29, 47,
48) is growing, even in the absence of CKD. Given the
already increased cardiovascular risk in obesity, FGF23
may play a role as dual offender in this population,
negatively affecting not only skeletal health, but also
cardiovascular health.
Strengths and limitations
Our study sample was relatively large, and included
detailed measurements of bone and mineral metabolism
and adiposity. In particular, we had specific measure-
ments of nearly every known determinant of FGF23 to
assess independent relationships between adiposity and
FGF23 levels. In addition to BMI, WC, and WHR, which
are relatively crude measures of adiposity, we were able
to use the refined measure of abdominal adipose tissue
areas derived from CT to strengthen and validate our
observations.
Our study did have several important limitations that
should be noted. The cross-sectional nature of this study
design precludes us from concluding causality or di-
rectionality. Although significant and independent of
numerous potential confounders, the effect estimates for
the absolute relationships between adiposity and FGF23,
as well as the variance in FGF23 explained by adiposity in
the models, were relatively small. However, because these
differences were in a population with normal kidney
function, in which the deleterious impact of FGF23 is
rarely studied, it may be premature to discount the size of
these observed effects. Furthermore, the cross-sectional
nature of the effect estimates prevents us from assessing
the consequences of small but chronically higher FGF23
levels over time. We have presented potential explana-
tions for the positive association of adiposity with FGF23
as being caused by excess adiposity. However, it is
possible that FGF23 itself may promote adiposity, via
increasing insulin resistance, for example, although evi-
dence for this is currently lacking. Longitudinal studies
may help to differentiate the direction of causality of our
findings. In addition, all of our study measurements were
performed at examination 1, except for the measure-
ments of abdominal adiposity by CT, which were per-
formed at examinations 2 or 3. However, we used the CT
measurements as a cross-sectional snapshot to validate
our findings with BMI, and in this regard, our two an-
alyses were complementary and consistent. We did not
have measures of serum 1,25OH2D or detailed in-
formation regarding dietary intake; however, the avail-
ability of PTH, as well as serum and urinary calcium and
phosphate levels, should have accounted for the actions
of 1,25OH2D and integrated dietary intake. Other
studies have investigated the relationship between dietary
intake and FGF23 levels (49). Last, we cannot extend
these findings to clinical outcomes related to skeletal
health, such as bone mineral density and fracture; further
study is needed to do so.

 In summary, we observed that higher adiposity, as
measured by BMI and abdominal adipose area according
to CT, was independently associated with higher FGF23
levels in a large cohort of participants with normal eGFR.
Higher FGF23 activity with greater adipose tissue burden
may provide an additional explanation for the increased
adverse skeletal outcomes seen in obesity. Further studies
are needed to better understand the causes and conse-
quences of high FGF23 in states of greater adiposity.
