Introduction
The biophilia hypothesis suggests that 
human beings have evolved to prefer certain 
natural environments that are essential to 
their thriving (Wilson 1984). Researchers 
are increasingly exploring how neighbor-
hood greenness, or vegetation, may affect 
health behaviors and outcomes (Hartig et al. 
2014; James et al. 2015a). Empirical research 
suggests that greenness may reduce obesity 
and promote physical activity (Lachowycz 
and Jones 2011) as well as improve cardio-
vascular health (Pereira et al. 2012), mental 
health (Alcock et al. 2014; Gascon et al. 
2015), and birth outcomes (Hystad et al. 
2014). Greenness has been hypothesized 
to benefit health by lowering exposure to 
air pollution, extreme heat, and noise; by 
increasing opportunities for physical activity; 
by providing a location for social engagement; 
and by decreasing psychological stress and 
depression through direct contact with nature 
(Hartig et al. 2014; Hystad et al. 2014; Taylor 
et al. 2015).
Evidence suggests that exposure to green-
ness may lower mortality rates, although 
many of these studies relied on aggregated 
data (Jonker et al. 2014; Lachowycz and Jones 
2014; Richardson et al. 2010; Richardson 
and Mitchell 2010), which limit inferences 
about the effect of greenness on individual 
health. Many mortality studies relied on 
cross-sectional data and could not estimate 
exposure over time (Hu et al. 2008; Mitchell 
and Popham 2008), whereas others could not 
account for important potential confounding 
by race/ethnicity, individual-level smoking, 
and area-level socioeconomic factors such 
as median home value (Takano et al. 2002; 
Villeneuve et al. 2012). Some studies have 
observed contradictory findings. One ecolog-
ical study conducted on the city level found 
that all-cause mortality was higher in greener 
cities (Richardson et al. 2012). An ecological 
analysis across the entire United Kingdom 
found that higher greenness was associated 
with lower cardiovascular and respiratory 
mortality among males; however, no signifi-
cant associations were found among women 
(Richardson and Mitchell 2010). A recent 
analysis of greenness and mortality in male 
and female stroke survivors living in the 
Boston area found that greater exposure to 
greenness was associated with higher survival 
rates (Wilker et al. 2014). To our knowledge, 
no study has examined time-varying green-
ness and mortality in a nationwide prospec-
tive cohort of women while accounting for 
important potential confounding factors and 
addressing potential mediators. Our objec-
tive was to examine the association between 
greenness and all-cause mortality, as well as 
cause-specific mortality, in a large prospective 
study of women across the entire contiguous 
United States. We hypothesized that higher 
levels of surrounding greenness would be 
associated with lower rates of all-cause, cancer, 
respiratory, and cardiovascular mortality; that 
these associations would differ by mortality 
cause; and that findings would support media-
tion by air pollution, physical activity, social 
 
engagement, and mental health.
Methods
Population
The Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) is a prospec-
tive cohort study assessing risk factors for 
chronic disease among women. In 1976, 
121,701 female registered nurses (30–55 years 
old) from 11 states (California, Connecticut, 
Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, 
New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, 
and Texas) returned an initial questionnaire, 
which ascertained a variety of health-related 
exposures and medical diagnoses. The cohort 
has been continuously followed with biennial 
questionnaires. Response rates at each ques-
tionnaire cycle have consistently been ≥ 90% 
(calculated as the number of women who 
successfully returned a questionnaire in each 
cycle among the women who were still alive).

Study of Women

Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA
Background: Green, natural environments may ameliorate adverse environmental exposures 
(e.g., air pollution, noise, and extreme heat), increase physical activity and social engagement, and 
lower stress.
oBjectives: We aimed to examine the prospective association between residential greenness 
and mortality.
Methods: Using data from the U.S.-based Nurses’ Health Study prospective cohort, we defined 
cumulative average time-varying seasonal greenness surrounding each participant’s address using 
satellite imagery [Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)]. We followed 108,630 women 
and observed 8,604 deaths between 2000 and 2008.
results: In models adjusted for mortality risk factors (age, race/ethnicity, smoking, and individual- 
and area-level socioeconomic status), women living in the highest quintile of cumulative average 
greenness (accounting for changes in residence during follow-up) in the 250-m area around their 
home had a 12% lower rate of all-cause nonaccidental mortality [95% confidence interval (CI); 
0.82, 0.94] than those in the lowest quintile. The results were consistent for the 1,250-m area, 
although the relationship was slightly attenuated. These associations were strongest for respiratory 
and cancer mortality. The findings from a mediation analysis suggested that the association between 
greenness and mortality may be at least partly mediated by physical activity, particulate matter 
< 2.5 μm, social engagement, and depression.
conclusions: Higher levels of green vegetation were associated with decreased mortality. Policies 
to increase vegetation may provide opportunities for physical activity, reduce harmful exposures, 
increase social engagement, and improve mental health. Planting vegetation may mitigate the 
effects of climate change; in addition, evidence of an association between vegetation and lower 
mortality rates suggests it also might be used to improve health.

questionnaires were matched (geocoded) to 
obtain latitude and longitude. Approximately 
90% of all addresses were successfully matched 
to the street segment level (within a range of 
house numbers along one side of the street). 
This analysis was conducted among all women 
who were alive in 2000 and had at least one 
residential address geocoded to the street 
segment level. Geocoded residence locations 
in 2000 are shown in Figure 1A; there were 
at least ten participating nurses in each of 
the contiguous United States. The study was 
approved by the Institutional Review Board of 
Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA, 
and informed consent was implied through 
return of the questionnaires.
Exposure
Exposure to vegetation around each partici-
pant’s home address was estimated using a 
satellite image–based vegetation index. 
Chlorophyll in plants absorbs visible light 
(0.4–0.7 μm) for use in photosynthesis, 
whereas leaves reflect near-infrared light 
(0.7–1.1 μm). The Normalized Difference 
Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculates the ratio 
of the difference between the near-infrared 
region and red reflectance to the sum of these 
two measures and ranges from –1.0 to 1.0, 
with larger values indicating higher levels of 
vegetative density (Kriegler et al. 1969). For 
this study, we used data from the Moderate-
resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer 
(MODIS) from NASA’s Terra satellite. 
MODIS provides images every 16 days at a 
250-m resolution (Carroll et al. 2004).
We used geographic information 
systems (GIS) software from ArcMap (ESRI, 
Redlands, CA) to estimate the mean NDVI 
value inside radii of 250- and 1,250-m buffers 
around each participant’s home. We chose 
the 250-m radius as a measure of greenness 
directly accessible outside each home and the 
1,250-m radius as a measure of greenness 
within a 10- to 15-min walk based on prior 
work within the Nurses’ Health Study cohorts 
on neighborhood environments and health 
behaviors (James et al. 2014). We created a 
seasonally time-varying measure based on the 
NDVI for a representative month in each 
season (January, April, July, and October) 
(Figure 1B–D). Two exposure metrics were 
calculated for each radius: contemporaneous 
NDVI (the greenness value for the current 
season), to reflect short-term exposure to 
greenness, and cumulative average NDVI 
(updated based on changes in seasonal NDVI 
as well as on changes in address), to reflect 
long-term exposure to greenness. For both 
exposure metrics, exposures were updated 
as NDVI changed over time as well as when 
participants moved to new residential addresses 
(updated based on the receipt of a biennial 
questionnaire with a new residential address).
Outcome
We assessed death occurring between the 
return of the 2000 questionnaire and 1 June 
2008. Deaths were usually reported by 
Figure 1. (A) Nurses’ Health Study geocoded residence locations at baseline (2000); NDVI 2000 Values in (B) January, (C) July, and (D) September.

families, and deaths among nonrespondents 
were identified by searching the National 
Death Index, which has been validated in 
prior studies in this cohort (Rich-Edwards 
et al. 1994). A physician reviewed death 
certificates and medical records to classify 
the primary cause of death according to the 
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision (ICD-9). Our primary outcome was 
death from all nonaccidental causes. Secondary 
cause–specific analyses were conducted for the 
following categories (infectious and parasitic 
diseases, ICD-9 codes 0–139; cancer, ICD-9 
codes 140–208; diabetes, ICD-9 code 250; 
neuro 
degenerative disease, ICD-9 codes 290, 
332, 335, 340, 342, 348; coronary heart 
disease, ICD-9 codes 390–429, 440–459; 
stroke, ICD-9 codes 430–438; respiratory 
diseases, ICD-9 codes 460–519; kidney disease 
580–593; and all other causes). Other deaths 
[including accidental (ICD-9 codes E800–
E999)] were included as negative control 
outcomes to detect potential confounding bias 
(Lipsitch et al. 2010).
Statistical Analysis
Person-months of follow-up were accrued 
from the return date of the 2000 question-
naire until either death or the end of follow-
up (31 May 2008), whichever came first. We 
fit time-varying Cox proportional hazards 
models to compute hazard ratios (HRs) and 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations 
between each NDVI exposure measure and 
each mortality outcome. We examined the 
following covariates as potential confounders, 
effect modifiers, or mediators (all covariates 
time-varying unless otherwise indicated): fixed 
race/ethnicity (White non-Hispanic versus 
other), smoking status (current, former, never), 
pack-years of smoking, fixed individual-level 
socioeconomic status (SES), area-level SES, 
weight status {normal [body mass index (BMI) 
18.5–24.9], overweight [BMI 25–29.9], obese 
[BMI > 30]}, region, urbanicity, whether a 
participant had changed addresses during 
follow-up, physical activity, air pollution, 
social engagement, and mental health. Current 
smoking status and pack-years smoked were 
updated at each biennial questionnaire. To 
account for fixed individual SES, we included 
information on self-reported parental occupa-
tion for the participant’s mother and father, 
whether the participant had a registered 
nursing degree, marital status, and husband’s 
highest educational attainment (< high school, 
high school graduate, > high school, missing 
or not married) as reported in 1992. We 
examined area-level SES by including infor-
mation on census-tract median home value 
and census-tract median income based on the 
census tract containing the residential address 
at each questionnaire response and 2000 
Census data (U.S. Census Bureau 2000). 
Urbanicity was determined by the partici-
pant’s residence in a metropolitan (urban area 
≥ 50,000 people), micropolitan (urban cluster 
of 10,000–49,999 people), or small town/
rural (urban cluster of < 10,000 people) census 
tract (Morrill et al. 1999). Physical activity 
was evaluated based on a validated biennial 
measure of self-reported total physical activity 
in the past year (Wolf et al. 1994). Although 
the specific activities varied on each question-
naire, questions included the average time per 
week spent walking, jogging (> 10 min per 
mile), running (≤ 10 min per mile), bicycling, 
lap swimming, playing tennis, playing squash 
or racquet ball, using a rowing machine, and 
engaging in calisthenics, aerobics, or aerobic 
dance. Each participant also reported the 
number of flights of stairs that she climbed 
daily and her usual walking pace. We multi-
plied the reported time spent weekly at each 
activity by its typical energy expenditure 
requirements expressed in metabolic equiva-
lents (METs), then summed all the activity 
figures to yield a MET hours per week score 
and categorized total physical activity as < 3, 
3–8.9, 9–17.9, 18–26.9, and ≥ 27 MET hr per 
week. These cut points were chosen to corre-
spond to the equivalent of < 1, 1 to < 3, 3 to 
< 6, 6 to < 9, and ≥ 9 hr per week of walking at 
an average pace, consistent with prior analyses 
in this cohort (Colditz et al. 2003; Meyerhardt 
et al. 2006). Air pollution was quantified as 
quintiles of residential address-level 12-month 
average particulate matter < 2.5 μm in aero-
dynamic diameter (PM2.5) predicted from 
a spatiotemporal generalized additive mixed 
model (Yanosky et al. 2014). Social engage-
ment was evaluated twice (2000 and 2004) 
over follow-up based on responses to the 
question “How many hours/week do you 
participate in groups?” (e.g., social, commu-
nity, charity, etc.). We dichotomized social 
engagement based on whether participants 
reported participating in groups ≥ 1 hr per 
week. Mental health was based on biennial 
self-report of physician-diagnosed depression 
or regular antidepressant use.
Analyses were stratified by age of follow-up 
(months) and time period and were adjusted 
for race/ethnicity, smoking status, pack-years 
of smoking, and individual-level SES measures 
based on questionnaire responses, as well as 
on census tract area-level SES measures. We 
used the missing indicator method to account 
for missing covariate data. We used cubic 
regression splines to determine the linearity of 
exposure–response relationships (Durrleman 
and Simon 1989). Tests for nonlinearity used 
the likelihood ratio test, comparing the model 
with only the linear term to the model with the 
linear and the cubic spline terms. We report 
results for both continuous NDVI and NDVI 
quintiles. We examined the linear test for 
trend using the ordinal rank for each quintile. 
To test for violations of the proportional 
hazards assumption, we included inter 
action 
terms of each exposure and calendar time and 
performed likelihood ratio tests to determine 
statistically significant violations. Additionally, 
we tested for effect modification of the rela-
tionship between greenness and mortality by 
race/ethnicity, smoking, census tract median 
income, census tract median home value, 
weight status [defined by normal weight (BMI 
18.5–24.9), overweight (BMI 25–29.9), 
and obese (BMI > 30)], physical activity, air 
pollution, region, urbanicity, and whether 
a participant had changed addresses during 
follow-up. We modeled interaction terms 
between continuous cumulative average NDVI 
in a 250-m buffer and each potential effect 
modifier and used likelihood ratio tests to 
assess statistical significance. We also obtained 
strata-specific effect estimates from stratified 
analyses. p-Values < 0.05 were used to define 
statistical significance. Data were analyzed 
using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
We explored potential mechanisms 
through which greenness might affect 
mortality by evaluating the mediating effect 
of factors such as physical activity, air pollu-
tion exposure, social engagement, or mental 
health. We calculated the mediation propor-
tion and its 95% CI using the publicly avail-
able %mediate macro (http://www.hsph.
harvard.edu/donna-spiegelman/software/
mediate/) (Lin et al. 1997). Briefly, the macro 
compares the exposure effect estimate from 
the full model that includes the exposure, 
one or more potential intermediate variables, 
and any covariates with the exposure effect 
estimate obtained from a partial model that 
leaves out the intermediate variable or vari-
ables. The mediation proportion is the 
proportion of reduced mortality explained 
by higher exposure to greenness that can be 
attributed to elevated levels of physical activity, 
air pollution exposure, social engagement, or 
mental health, as well as the joint effect of all 
of these mediators combined. Confidence 
intervals for the mediation proportion were 
calculated using the data duplication method 
(Lin et al. 1997). Mediation analyses assumed 
that there was no unmeasured exposure–
outcome confounding, no unmeasured 
mediator–outcome confounding, no unmea-
sured exposure–mediator confounding, and 
no mediator–outcome confounder affected 
by exposure (VanderWeele 2015). Although 
these assumptions are unverifiable, we included 
major confounders in our mediation analyses, 
and therefore, we believe our assumptions 
are reasonable.
Results
Participants were primarily White non-
Hispanic, normal weight, and had low levels 
of physical activity (Table 1). The majority of 
 Greenness and mortality in a nationwide cohort

participants lived in metropolitan areas, and 
half of the sample lived in the Northeastern 
United States. Those living in areas with 
higher levels of greenness were slightly 
younger, more likely to be White non-
Hispanic, had husbands with higher levels of 
education, and lived in neighborhoods with 
higher SES. Areas with higher greenness had 
lower levels of air pollution.
We observed 8,604 deaths over 627,008 
person-years of follow-up among the 108,630 
eligible cohort members. Table 2 shows 
HRs for the relationship between cumula-
tive average greenness exposure and nonacci-
dental mortality. Analyses showed a consistent 
relationship between higher greenness and 
decreased mortality that was robust to adjust-
ment for individual- and area-level covariates. 
In fully adjusted models, those living in the 
highest quintile of cumulative average green-
ness in the 250-m area around their home 
had a 12% lower rate of mortality (95% CI: 
0.82, 0.94) than those in the lowest quintile. 
Results were consistent for the 1,250-m radius, 
although the relationship was slightly attenu-
ated. Likelihood ratio tests from cubic regres-
sion spline analyses indicated that relationships 
between greenness and mortality rate were 
linear (data not shown). Continuous analyses 
also indicated an inverse association between 
greenness and mortality, with a 12% lower 
rate of mortality (95% CI: 0.82, 0.94) in 
fully-adjusted models based on a 0.1 increase 
in cumulative average NDVI in the 250-m 
area around participants’ homes. Again, the 
association was attenuated in the 1,250-m 
buffer. Results from models of contempo-
raneous NDVI were weaker but showed a 
generally consistent inverse association between 
 
greenness and mortality.
Cause-specific mortality analyses 
revealed that the associations were strongest 
for respiratory, cancer, and kidney disease 
mortality, and we observed negative HRs 
for stroke mortality that were not statis-
tically significant (Table 3). We estimated 
that those living in the highest quintile of 
cumulative average greenness in the 250-m 
area around their home had a 34% lower 
rate of respiratory disease–related mortality 
(95% CI: 0.52, 0.84), a 13% lower rate of 
cancer mortality (95% CI: 0.78, 0.97), and 
a 41% lower rate of kidney disease mortality 
(95% CI: 0.33, 1.05) than those in the lowest 
quintile. We did not observe any statistically 
significant associations between greenness 
and mortality from coronary heart disease,

diabetes, or infections. In addition, associa-
tions for our negative control outcome of 
other deaths (including accidental, 185 out of 
the 1,219 other deaths) were null.
Stratified Analyses
We observed no statistically significant differ-
ences in the association between greenness and 
mortality by race/ethnicity, smoking status, 
census tract median income, census tract 
median home value, PM2.5, weight status, 
region, urbanicity, or between movers and 
nonmovers (see Figure S1). Stratified analyses 
for physical activity, urbanicity, census tract 
median income, and PM2.5 are shown in 
Figure 2. We did observe a stronger associa-
tion between greenness and mortality among 
participants with higher physical activity levels, 
although there was no statistical evidence of 
a difference in associations (p = 0.14). More 
precise relationships were observed for green-
ness in metropolitan areas compared with 
micropolitan and rural areas; however, we did 
not observe statistical evidence of a difference 
in associations across levels of urbanicity. This 
finding likely reflects that 84% of our sample 
lived in urban areas. There was no statistical 
evidence of a difference in associations across 
different levels of census tract median income 
(interaction p-value = 0.99).
Mediation
Estimates of the proportion of the association 
between greenness and mortality that might 
be mediated by other factors (assuming that 
underlying assumptions of the mediation 
analyses hold) were statistically significant for 
physical activity, PM2.5, social engagement, 
and mental health (Table 4). The largest

 Greenness and mortality in a nationwide cohort
Environmental Health Perspectives • volume 124 | number 9 | September 2016

proportion of mediation was physician- 
diagnosed depression or antidepressant 
use, which was estimated to explain 30.6% 
(95% CI: 15.5%, 51.4%) of the association 
between cumulative average greenness in a 
250-m buffer and mortality, and social 
engagement, which was estimated to explain 
19.1% (95% CI: 10.0%, 33.3%) of this 
association. Although the estimated propor-
tions explained were smaller, they were also 
statistically significant for physical activity 
[2.1% explained (95% CI: 0.2%, 19.3%)] 
and air pollution [4.4% explained (95% CI: 
2.4%, 7.7%)]. The estimate from the joint 
mediation analysis suggested that all four 
mediators combined might explain 27.1% 
(95% CI: 14.7%, 44.6%) of the association 
between greenness and all-cause mortality. 
The findings were generally similar for green-
ness in a 1,250-m radius. Table S1 shows 
mediation results for cancer, respiratory, and 
kidney disease mortality, where we observed 
the strongest estimate of mediation by the 
mental health pathway and the weakest 
estimate of mediation by physical activity.
Discussion
In this nationwide study of adult women, 
higher levels of greenness around each 
participant’s home address were associated 
with lower rates of all-cause, nonaccidental 
mortality regardless of adjustment for age, 
race/ethnicity, smoking status, individual-
level SES, and area-level SES. These findings 
were strongest for cancer, respiratory, and 
kidney disease mortality. The results were 
consistent when focusing on the area imme-
diately around each residence (250-m buffer) 
versus a larger radius (1,250-m buffer) around 
each participant’s home. The results were 
strongest when examining cumulative average 
exposure to greenness versus contempora-
neous greenness, suggesting a larger health 
benefit of chronic exposure to greenness. The 
association between greenness and mortality 
was not statistically significantly different 
by race/ethnicity, physical activity, smoking 
status, area-level SES, air pollution exposure, 
weight status, region of the United States, 
whether a participant lived in a rural or urban 
area, or whether a participant moved during 
follow-up. Assuming that the assumptions 
of the mediation analysis hold, our estimates 
suggest that a large proportion of the associa-
tion between greenness and mortality may be 
explained through mental health pathways of 
depression risk and social engagement, which 
subsequently affected mortality.

Our findings were consistent with, yet 
slightly stronger than, those of a general 
population mortality study that was cross-
sectional (Mitchell and Popham 2008), 
as well those of as a study that was unable 
to adjust for individual-level smoking and 
sociodemographic characteristics (Villeneuve 
et al. 2012). Mitchell and Popham (2008) 
classified the percentage of green space for 
geographic units across England and observed 
lower levels of all-cause and circulatory 
mortality in the greenest areas, with an esti-
mated 6% reduction (95% CI: 4%, 7%) in 
all-cause mortality in geographic units with 
the highest quintile of green space. A study 
of residents of Ontario, Canada found that 
an interquartile range (IQR) difference in 
NDVI (0.24) was associated with an esti-
mated 5% (95% CI: 3%, 6%) reduced rate 
of nonaccidental mortality (Villeneuve et al. 
2012). Wilker et al. (2014) followed patients 
in the Boston, Massachusetts area who had 
suffered ischemic strokes and found that 
those living in the highest quartile of NDVI 
had an estimated 22% (95% CI: 3%, 37%) 
lower rate of all-cause mortality than those 
in the lowest quartile. Our findings differed 
from those of an ecological study of 49 major 
cities across the United States that used the 
National Land Cover Database to define 
greenness (Richardson et al. 2012). This 
analysis showed that all-cause mortality rates 
were highest in the greenest cities; however, 
the city-level, cross-sectional analysis could 
not account for any individual-level factors, 
including smoking. In addition, an ecological 
cross-sectional study of urban wards across 
the United Kingdom found no relation-
ship between greenness, measured through a 
land use database and satellite imagery, and 
cardiovascular, respiratory, or lung cancer 
mortality among women (Richardson and 
Mitchell 2010).
In cause-specific mortality analyses, we 
observed associations between greenness 
and respiratory, cancer, and kidney disease 
mortality. The findings for respiratory and 
cancer mortality are consistent with the 
pathway that greenness reduces air pollu-
tion exposure and increases physical activity, 
which are known to lower the risk of these 
outcomes (Hamra et al. 2014; Hoek et al. 
2013; Lee et al. 2012). In addition, our 
findings on respiratory mortality were 
similar to those observed by Villeneuve et al. 
(2012). Although the absolute number of 
cases was small, there was a strong relation-
ship between greenness and kidney disease 
that has not been observed in previous 
studies. This relationship could exist because 
greenness is linked to physical activity; 
inadequate physical activity is a risk factor 
for kidney disease (Stump 2011). We also 
observed suggestive evidence for a link 
between greenness and stroke mortality, 
which has been observed in other studies 
(Hu et al. 2008; Villeneuve et al. 2012). 
Although prior research has shown relation-
ships between greenness and coronary heart 
disease, diabetes, and infections (Lachowycz 
and Jones 2014; Mitchell and Popham 
2008; Rook 2013), we did not observe 
associations for these outcomes. A possible 
explanation for these discrepant findings is 
that our cohort of female nurses may utilize 
greenness in different ways than cohorts that 
include men (Richardson and Mitchell 2010) 
or individuals from other SES groups. Our 
finding of no association between greenness 
exposure and other deaths (including acci-
dental), which can be considered negative 
controls because there is no clear mechanism 
for an association, lends confidence that the 
observed associations are not the result of 
uncontrolled confounding or other sources 
of bias that create a spurious causal inference 
(Lipsitch et al. 2010).
Our mediation analyses suggest that 
greenness affects all-cause mortality, as well 
as cancer, respiratory, and kidney disease 
mortality, through mental health, social 
engagement, physical activity, and air pollu-
tion. There is a foundation for each of these 
mechanisms in the literature. An analysis by 
de Vries et al. (2013) estimated that stress 
and social cohesion mediated the relation-
ship between streetscape greenery and health. 
In their study, total physical activity was not 
a mediator; however, physical activity that 
took place in a public space did appear to 
mediate the greenery–health relationship. 
Higher exposure to greenness has been consis-
tently linked to lower levels of depression, 
anxiety, and stress (Alcock et al. 2014; Beyer 
et al. 2014; Gascon et al. 2015). Studies 
have shown that views of nature may have 
a direct psychological benefit (Fuller et al. 
2007). Higher levels of social engagement 
are also correlated with greenness exposure 
(Maas et al. 2009). Greenness appears to 
buffer exposure to air pollution (Dadvand 
et al. 2012; Su et al. 2009), and vegetation 
has been shown to remove particulate matter, 
sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide 
(Nowak et al. 2006), although evidence is 
inconsistent for other pollutants (Kim et al. 
2013). Greenness may protect individuals 
from exposure to harmful noise (Gidlöf-
Gunnarsson and Öhrström 2007) as well as 
alleviate thermal discomfort during heat stress 
(Lafortezza et al. 2009). Greater exposure to 
greenness has been associated with higher 
levels of physical activity (Almanza et al. 
2012), but, consistent with our findings, 
other studies have shown that physical 
activity does not fully explain the relationship 
between greenness and health (Lachowycz 
and Jones 2014).
This study had a few limitations. The 
most appropriate scale at which to measure 
greenness is unclear (Mitchell et al. 2011). 
This uncertainty in the relevant geographic 
context to study exposure is a fundamental 
problem in spatial analyses (Kwan 2012). We 
explored two geographic scales (250-m and 
1,250-m buffers) that yielded similar results, 
but it is unclear whether we would have 
observed stronger or weaker relationships if 
we had examined different scales. Although 
satellite-based measures of vegetation have 
been used extensively to measure exposure 
to greenness, NDVI does not measure the 
quality of greenness. Nevertheless, a vali-
dation study demonstrated that NDVI 
performs adequately when compared with 
environmental psychologists’ evaluations of 
green spaces (Rhew et al. 2011). Three envi-
ronmental psychologists examined photo-
graphs, evaluated greenness on a Likert scale 
(none or very little to very high greenness), 
and compared their evaluations to NDVI 
measured in a 100-m radius around 124 
homes in Baltimore, Maryland/Washington, 
DC and Seattle, Washington. Interrater 
reliability was high between environmental 
psychologist evaluations [intraclass correla-
tion (ICC) = 0.82], and correlations between 
the photograph ratings and NDVI were high 
(r = 0.69, p < 0.001), indicating that NDVI 
may be a valid measure of greenness. Because 
of a lack of time-varying, nationwide data, 
we did not examine the association between 
exposure to major green spaces (e.g., parks) 
and mortality. The NHS data set enabled 
evaluation of many potential confounders 
and mediators; however, we remained limited 
in our ability to measure exposure to heat 
and noise, which could play important roles 
in how greenness affects health. In addition, 
the underlying assumptions required for esti-
mates from the mediation analysis to be valid 
are unverifiable, which is a limitation of our 
mediation analysis. Selection into neighbor-
hoods according to health status is a consis-
tent concern in studies of geographic context 
and health. If participants in better health 
selected to move to neighborhoods with 
higher levels of greenness, this confounding 
by neighborhood preference could explain the 
relationship between greenness and mortality. 
However, in prior analyses, we showed that 
BMI and physical activity levels did not 
predict neighborhood selection by built-envi-
ronment features in this cohort (James et al. 
2015b); therefore, it is unlikely that neighbor-
hood self-selection is a major concern. The 
consistent relationship between greenness 
and SES measures indicated the potential 
for strong confounding; however, we aimed 
to reduce the likelihood of confounding 
by adjusting for multiple  
individual- and 
area-level measures of SES. The association

between greenness and mortality was consis-
tent across different levels of area-level SES, 
which lends additional confidence that the 
observed relationships were not a conse-
quence of unmeasured confounding by area-
level SES. Additionally, the negative control 
outcome of other deaths was not associated 
with greenness, further decreasing the like-
lihood that our findings were an artifact of 
confounding. Because of the geographic 
distribution of our sample, it is likely that 
we had limited power to assess variation by 
region and by urban/rural differences. Finally, 
participants in this study were nurses at the 
time of recruitment, > 90% were White non-
Hispanic, and all were female. Although the 
homogeneity of the study participants does 
restrict the generalizability of these results 
to the general population, it also eliminates 
confounding by sex and reduces the potential 
for confounding by SES and race/ethnicity.
This study also has a number of notable 
strengths. To our knowledge, it is the first 
prospective examination of the relationship 
between exposure to greenness and mortality 
across the entire United States. We were 
able to construct time-varying measures of 
exposure to greenness in the area surrounding 
each participant’s home address over 8 years 
of follow-up. Additionally, we were able to 
control for important confounders, such as 
smoking status and individual- and area-level 
SES. Because participants were located in a 
diverse range of geographic settings across the 
country, we were able to test whether the rela-
tionship between greenness and mortality was 
consistent in different regions, as well as in 
urban and rural locations. Finally, measure-
ments of important intermediate expo-
sures and behaviors enabled us to examine 
the potential mechanisms through which 
 
greenness affects mortality.
Conclusions
In this nationwide cohort of adult women, 
we observed that those living in the highest 
quintile of satellite-measured green vegeta-
tion around their home had a lower mortality 
rate than those living in the lowest quintile 
of greenness. Findings were consistent across 
all regions of the United States, as well as in 
urban and rural areas, and we observed no 
threshold at which greater greenness exposure 
was not associated with lower mortality rates. 
Mediation analyses suggested that the asso-
ciation between greenness and mortality was 
explained primarily by improving mental 
health and increasing social engagement, as 
well as by lowering air pollution exposure 
and increasing physical activity. Although 
additional research is required on the rela-
tionship between other natural environments 
and health [e.g., blue spaces (Gascon et al. 
2015)], these findings suggest that green 
vegetation has a protective effect and that 
policies to increase vegetation in both urban 
and rural areas may provide opportunities for 
physical activity, reduce harmful exposures, 
increase social engagement, and improve 
mental health. The recognized benefits of 
planting vegetation include reducing waste-
water loads, sequestering carbon, and miti-
gating the effects of climate change (Jesdale 
et al. 2013); the additional evidence of an 
association between vegetation and reduced 
mortality rates suggests a potential co-benefit 
to improve health, presenting planners, land-
scape architects, and policy makers with an 
actionable tool to grow healthier places.
