ABSTRACT
Background A previous analysis examined the
contribution of endocrine disruptor exposures (endocrine-
disrupting chemicals, EDCs) to adult diabetes, but was
limited to effects of phthalates in middle-aged women
and did not simultaneously examine multiple EDCs
which are known to coexist in the environment. We
therefore endeavoured to quantify potential reductions in
diabetes and disease costs that could result from
reducing synthetic chemical diabetogenic exposures in
the elderly in Europe.
Methods We leveraged the Prospective Investigation of
the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) study
(∼1000 participants), which has measured exposure to
phthalates; dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethylene;
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and perfluoroalkyl
substances to examine their independent contribution to
diabetes. We estimated risk reductions assuming
identical 25% reductions across levels of 4 selected
compounds (PCB 153, monoethylphthalate,
dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene and perfluorononanoic
acid), and diabetes costs saved in European men and
women if diabetogenic exposures are limited.
Results Reduction of chemical exposures was
associated with a 13% (95% CI 2% to 22%) reduction
in prevalent diabetes, compared with 40% resulting
from an identical (25%) reduction in body mass index
(BMI) in cross-sectional analyses. Extrapolating to
Europe, 152 481 cases of diabetes in Europe and €4.51
billion/year in associated costs could be prevented,
compared with 469 172 cases prevented by reducing
BMI.
Conclusions These findings support regulatory and
individual efforts to reduce chemical exposures to reduce
the burden and costs of diabetes.
INTRODUCTION
Increasing evidence suggests that synthetic chemi-
cals commonly found in the environment contrib-
ute to metabolic disorders, especially obesity and
diabetes.1 2 Though diet and physical activity are
the major contributors, chemical exposures can be
regulated. The costs of safer alternatives to the dia-
betogenic and other metabolic disruptors can be
compared with the health benefits of prevention.3
A recent report suggests that €15 billion in costs
of new-onset, type 2 diabetes in older women are
attributable
to
endocrine-disrupting
chemicals
(EDCs).4 This study leveraged the Nurses’ Health
Study which associated urinary phthalates with lon-
gitudinal increases in diabetes, controlling many
relevant
confounders.
Though
this
study
did
control for another plausible diabetogen, bisphenol
A, the study was unable to control for persistent
organic
pollutants that
coexist
and
may
have
supra-additive effects.5
W
e therefore examined data from the Prospective
Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors
(PIVUS)
study,
which
measured
persistent
and
non-persistent chemical exposure to examine their
independent
contribution
to
diabetes.
Previous
publications have associated prevalent diabetes with
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), persistent chlori-
nated
pesticides,
phthalates
and
perfluoroalkyl
substances (PFASs).6–9 Use of PIVUS also permits
quantification of attributable burden in men as well
as women, in whom exposures are likely to induce
diabetes independent of sex steroid disruption,
since the age is 70 years in all participants.
To compare risks with other common risks, we
modelled identical 25% percentage reductions in
contaminant levels, as well as in body mass index
(BMI). W
e also examined the aggregate reduction
in risk produced by simultaneously reducing all
four contaminants to assess an aggregate burden of
diabetes that can be attributed to environmental
contaminants. Finally, we leveraged cost-of-illness
data to estimate the preventable cost of adult dia-
betes in Europeans.
METHODS
Sample
PIVUS is a population-based cohort derived from
the individuals aged 70 living in the city of
Uppsala, Sweden (n=1016; 50% women). For full
details, please see Lind et al.10 Prevalent diabetes
was defined as antidiabetic therapy or fasting
plasma
glucose
≥7.0 mmol/L
(n=119).
Fasting
blood was drawn in the morning for the determin-
ation of 33 environmental contaminants. The fol-
lowing calculations were based on data previously
presented regarding the risk of prevalent diabetes
of different environmental contaminants.6–9 The
present analyses use a cross-sectional design. Owing
to randomly missing data for some of the contami-
nants, data from 953 of the participants were used
in the calculations.
Statistical methods
Biomarkers were selected based on significance in
multivariable,
single-exposure
models:
plasma
monoethylphthalate (MEP); serum dichlorodiphe-
nyldichloroethylene
(p,p0-DDE);
serum
2,20,4,
40,5,5’-hexachlorobiphenyl
(PCB
153);
and
perfluorononanoic
acid
(PFNA).
The
analytical
procedures have previously been given in detail
(6–9). Poisson regression models were used as the
bases for the calculations. Included as independent
variables in the models were the four contaminants
as well as sex, BMI, physical activity, daily energy

 intake and daily alcohol intake. Population attributable fractions
(PAFs) were calculated based on the attribrisk function in the
R-package with the same name with two exceptions. Attribrisk
uses logistic regression whereas we sought relative risk/preva-
lence ratio as the outcome could be considered common and an
OR would not be a good approximation for the relative risk.
Hence, Poisson regression was used instead, following published
methods.11 To estimate PAFs, we first note that the estimated
probability from the Poisson regression of being a case for any
individual in the sample is
^
PðcaseÞ ¼eXb
where Xβ is the linear predictor resulting from the regression
model. X denotes the design matrix and β is the vector of
regression coefficient. Focusing on cases only, we can estimate
the probability of being a case under a hypothetical scenario in
which the exposure(s) are reduced by a certain amount given as
^
P(casehypotheticaljcaseobserved) ¼ eXcb
where XC is the contrast matrix obtained by subtracting the
observed exposure(s) from the hypothetical. The sum of all pre-
dicted probabilities for the cases in the sample corresponds to
the expected number of cases expected under the hypothetical
scenario. The PAF is then calculated as
PAF ¼ 1 �
1
Ncases

egXCb
where γ is a shrinkage factor defined as
g ¼ model x2 � p
model x2
where p is the total degrees of freedom and model χ2 is the like-
lihood ratio statistic for testing the joint influence of all variables
in the model.12 As there were few cases of diabetes relative to
the model degrees of freedom, the models may overfit. The
shrinkage factor shrinks the PAF towards zero and was used to
compensate for the overfitting when generalising the results to
the European population.
Five models were developed with the difference between the
models being the hypothetical scenarios. The first scenario
assumed a simultaneous 25% decrease in all four contaminants
while the remaining scenarios assumed a 25% decrease in a
single contaminant while keeping the other contaminants con-
stant. The bootstrap was used to construct 95% bias corrected
and accelerated CIs for PAF using 10 000 replicates.13 All ana-
lyses were made using R V

Burden of disease and economic estimation
The number of diabetes cases among 70–75 years old was esti-
mated by multiplying age-standardised prevalence of diabetes in
Europe (6.5%)14 against the population estimate of 70–75 years
old.15 Annual cost estimates for diabetes per adult in 2010 were
obtained from the analyses by Zhang et al,16 in US dollars.
Given that prevalent diabetes results in costs over multiple years
of each subsequent lifetime, annual costs were aggregated over a
10-year period, using 3% discounting.
Human participants
PIVUS was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University
of Uppsala and the participants gave informed consent. LT
signed a New York University School of Medicine Institutional
Review Board attestation form documenting the nature of his
involvement as non-human participants research.
RESULTS
Table 1 presents descriptive biomarker data analysed in relation
to diabetes, documenting exposures similar to those identified
in other European populations. All four exposures taken singly
had near-significant prevalence ratios (table 2), though reduction
of all four exposures by 25% was associated with a 13% (95%
CI 2% to 22%) lower prevalence of diabetes, compared with a
40% reduction in diabetes prevalence in association with an
identical (25%) reduction in BMI. Extrapolation to Europe sug-
gests that 152 481 cases of diabetes could be prevented by redu-
cing EDC exposure, compared with 469 172 produced by a
population-wide 25% reduction in BMI (table 3). Economic
benefits of reducing EDC-attributable diabetes were estimated
to be €4.51 billion/year compared with the €13.9 billion benefits
of reducing BMI.
DISCUSSION
The present study confirms substantial contribution, especially of
mixtures of EDCs, to adult type 2 diabetes, and large annual costs
of medical care.4 While some will question extrapolation on limited
data, our findings regarding chemical diabetogens are not unique
and have also been found by several other research groups.5 17–22
These epidemiological findings are likely to be causal, since they are
in line with experimental mechanistic data.23–32
All the same, we acknowledge that residual confounding may
have resulted in effect overestimation for the chemical exposures
studied. The calculated PAFs may not apply to older age ranges

biomarker
levels
have
decreased
ecologically.
Exposures much earlier than study entry may have contributed
to those measured in biomarkers at study entry.
It should be emphasised that PCBs have already been banned,
under the Stockholm Convention.33 34 The pesticide dichlorodi-
phenyltrichloroethylene, for which the measured levels of p,
p0-DDE are proxy, has also been banned, except for the eradica-
tion of malaria in some parts of southern Africa. Long-chain
perfluoroalkyl compounds, including PFNA, have completed a
voluntary phase-out in the USA, though the expected reductions
in serum PFNA have not been identified.35 36
Yet, healthcare providers can advise patients to reduce their
exposure to diabetogenic contaminants identified in this study.
Choosing personal care products labelled as ‘phthalate free’ has
reduced urinary levels of MEP by 27% in young girls in one
study.37 Other phthalates known to be metabolic disruptors are
known food contaminants, and a fresh food intervention has
produced even larger reductions in exposure.38 Short-chain
PFASs contaminate food through packaging and contact sur-
faces, and are increasingly found in food.39 Consumption of a
diet according to WHO recommendations has been associated
with lower levels of PFASs and PCBs.40 41
Our findings also speak the need for a strong regulatory
framework that proactively identifies chemical hazards before
they are widely used, and the use of safer alternatives. The
European Union is actively considering regulations to limit such
exposures,4 and the USA recently revised the Toxic Substances
Control Act,42 but does not consider endocrine disruption. In
the absence of such a framework, newly developed synthetic
chemicals may emerge as diabetogenic exposures, replacing
banned or substituted hazards as contributors.
CONCLUSIONS
Environmental contaminants contribute substantially to diabetes
in the elderly, with costs in Europe likely to be in billions of
Euros.
What is already known on this subject
Increasing evidence suggests that synthetic chemicals commonly
found in the environment contribute to metabolic disorders,
especially obesity and diabetes. Yet, only one study has
quantified attributable disease and costs, did not examine
mixtures of chemicals which may have synergistic effects and
was limited to effects in middle-aged women.
What this study adds
Reduction of chemical exposures was associated with a 13%
(95% CI 2% to 22%) reduction in diabetes in the elderly,
preventing 152 481 cases of diabetes in Europe and €4.51
billion/year in associated costs. These findings support
regulatory and individual efforts to reduce chemical exposures.
