Summary
Background Provision of early intervention services has increased the rate of social recovery in patients with first-
episode psychosis; however, many individuals have continuing severe and persistent problems with social 
functioning. We aimed to assess the efficacy of early intervention services augmented with social recovery therapy in 
patients with first-episode psychosis. The primary hypothesis was that social recovery therapy plus early intervention 
services would lead to improvements in social recovery.
Methods We did this single-blind, phase 2, randomised controlled trial (SUPEREDEN3) at four specialist early 
intervention services in the UK. We included participants who were aged 16–35 years, had non-affective psychosis, 
had been clients of early intervention services for 12–30 months, and had persistent and severe social disability, 
defined as engagement in less than 30 h per week of structured activity. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), 
via computer-generated randomisation with permuted blocks (sizes of four to six), to receive social recovery therapy 
plus early intervention services or early intervention services alone. Randomisation was stratified by sex and 
recruitment centre (Norfolk, Birmingham, Lancashire, and Sussex). By necessity, participants were not masked to 
group allocation, but allocation was concealed from outcome assessors. The primary outcome was time spent in 
structured activity at 9 months, as measured by the Time Use Survey. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is 
registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN61621571.
Findings Between Oct 1, 2012, and June 20, 2014, we randomly assigned 155 participants to receive social recovery 
therapy plus early intervention services (n=76) or early intervention services alone (n=79); the intention-to-treat 
population comprised 154 patients. At 9 months, 143 (93%) participants had data for the primary outcome. Social 
recovery therapy plus early intervention services was associated with an increase in structured activity of 8·1 h 
(95% CI 2·5–13·6; p=0·0050) compared with early intervention services alone. No adverse events were deemed 
attributable to study therapy.
Interpretation Our findings show a clinically important benefit of enhanced social recovery on structured activity in 
patients with first-episode psychosis who received social recovery therapy plus early intervention services. Social 
recovery therapy might be useful in improving functional outcomes in people with first-episode psychosis, particularly 
in individuals not motivated to engage in existing psychosocial interventions targeting functioning, or who have 
comorbid difficulties preventing them from doing so.

Introduction
Provision of early intervention services for first-episode 
psychosis has resulted in considerable gains in social 
functioning outcomes by comparison with traditional 
more generic mental health services.1–3 These services 
provide a range of interventions that aim to facilitate social 
recovery, including recovery-oriented intensive outreach 
case management.4,5 Before provision of early intervention 
services, as few as 15% of patients would make either 
partial or full social recovery at 2 years;6 this rate increased 
to between 40% and 60% after provision of these services.6,7
Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of individuals 
have continuing severe and persistent problems with 
social functioning, even after 12 months of provision of 
specialist early intervention services.8 People with poor 
responses to early intervention services often represent a 
subgroup who, although presenting with first-episode 
psychosis, have chronic severe and complex mental 
health and social functioning problems that date back 
premorbidly to childhood.8 Problems associated with 
social recovery in people with first-episode psychosis are 
complex and include poor engagement with service

providers, loss of role and social contacts, perceived 
stigma and shame, anxiety and depression, and 
treatment-resistant psychotic symptoms.9 These per-
sistent difficulties often result in lifelong patterns of 
social withdrawal.10 Addressing these issues at an early 
stage is key because the presence of persistent early 
social decline is associated with a poor long-term course 
of schizophrenia.11 In addition to the personal conse-
quences of functional disability, there are also large 
financial implications for society, with much of the cost 
of psychosis resulting from lost productivity.12
New interventions targeting functional and social 
recovery are needed in people with first-episode psychosis. 
Conventional cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for 
psychosis has shown some evidence of effectiveness on 
social disability as a secondary outcome, even when the 
primary focus has been on reducing positive symptoms 
of psychosis.13 More specific adaptations of CBT for 
psychosis targeting negative symptoms and social 
recovery have shown promise.14–16 Functional interventions 
such as individual placement and support have been 
effective in helping individuals to return to paid 
employment.17 However, this intervention is most 
successful in individuals who are motivated to engage 
and wish to work, and might be less effective in 
individuals who have poor engagement, are ambivalent 
about change, and continue to have comorbid difficulties.17 
Intervention needs to target a wider construct of social 
recovery than work alone, such as education and voluntary 
work, and household activity and child care, which are 
productive economic activities. Prosocial activity with 
peers is also crucial in ensuring that young people achieve 
development milestones and continue to thrive at a key 
stage in life. Such principles are consistent with the user-
oriented goals identified by the recovery movement.18,19
We have developed an intervention that focuses on 
social recovery. The rationale behind social recovery 
therapy9 is that in-vivo multisystemic assertive outreach 
and case management are necessary to encourage 
socially 
withdrawn 
individuals 
back 
into 
social 
environments, whereas the techniques of CBT are 
necessary to promote engagement and overcome the 
symptoms that impede this. The intensive and novel 
combination of these elements of therapy provide the 
possibility of making meaningful changes to the lives of 
very withdrawn and difficult to engage young people who 
have not previously responded to standard early 
intervention services provision.
Preliminary evidence for the efficacy of social recovery 
therapy derives from the ISREP MRC Trial Platform 
Study,14 which suggested that the intervention can 
improve social recovery in individuals in the early stages 
of psychosis and is cost-effective.20 In that trial, unem-
ployed adults with up to 8 years of history of non-affective 
psychosis showed clinically and statistically significant 
 
improvements in structured activity, symptoms, hope-
lessness, and rates of employment after 9 months of 
social recovery therapy. Although these findings are 
promising, targeting social disability at an even earlier 
stage might improve outcomes.
We did the SUPEREDEN3 trial to assess the efficacy of 
adding social recovery therapy to early intervention

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Problems with social functioning are common after 
first-episode psychosis and can persist over time, resulting in 
poor long-term outcomes. We searched PubMed from 
inception to July 19, 2017, with the search terms “first episode 
psychosis”, “social functioning”, and “psychological 
treatments”. We identified 19 papers, of which ten were 
relevant because they referred to factors influencing recovery 
from psychosis. However, few studies assessed interventions 
targeting social recovery as a primary outcome. Meta-analyses 
of psychological interventions for psychosis have shown some 
evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy 
on functioning as a secondary outcome, but its primary focus is 
on reducing the positive symptoms of psychosis. Other 
psychosocial interventions, including individual placement and 
support, cognitive remediation, and social skills training, all 
target functional outcomes, but each focuses on specific 
aspects of functioning, such as return to work and skills 
acquisition. Further research is needed focusing on a wider 
construct of social recovery and including individuals who 
might find it difficult to engage in existing psychosocial 
interventions because of comorbid difficulties.
Added value of this study
Our findings show that social recovery therapy plus early 
intervention services is superior to early intervention services 
alone on the primary outcome of time spent in structured 
activity. Individuals who participated in this study had complex 
difficulties warranting intensive and targeted intervention. 
Participants were young people with extreme social withdrawal 
who also had a wide range of other complex comorbidities, 
including high levels of treatment-resistant and residual 
positive psychotic symptoms, negative symptoms, and anxiety 
and depression, as well as the presence of current hopelessness 
and a lack of hope for the future. To our knowledge, this is the 
first study to show a significant improvement in functioning in 
an already highly disabled group at a crucial stage in life.
Implications of all the available evidence
Social recovery therapy could be useful in improving functional 
outcomes in people with first-episode psychosis, particularly in 
individuals not motivated to engage in existing psychosocial 
interventions targeting functioning, or who have comorbid 
difficulties that prevent them from doing so.

services, with the aim of achieving a step-change in early 
social recovery in young people who have severe and 
persistent social disability despite receiving early 
intervention services for more than 1 year after their first 
episode of psychosis. The primary hypothesis was that 
augmentation of early intervention services with social 
recovery therapy would lead to improvements in time 
spent in structured activity at 9 months. Secondary 
hypo 
theses were that the effects on activity would persist 
at 15 months and that there would be benefits on general 
psychopathology and negative symptoms.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did this single-blind, phase 2, randomised controlled 
trial at four well established early intervention services in 
the UK. Ethics approval was granted by the National 
Research Ethics Service Committee in the Black Country, 
West Midlands (reference 12/WM/0097). We did the trial 
in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice guideline.
Eligible patients were aged 16–35 years; had non-
affective psychosis; were clients of early intervention 
services in Birmingham, Lancashire, Norfolk, and Sussex 
(for entry into early intervention services in the UK, 
individuals are required to have psychotic symptoms 
with a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] 
score of ≥4); had been clients of early intervention 
services for 12–30 months; and had low levels of 
structured activity after at least 1 year of treatment in 
early intervention services (defined as ≤30 h/week on the 
Time Use Survey21). We excluded patients if they were 
part of the original National EDEN cohort,22 did not speak 
adequate English to engage in the intervention, and were 
deemed too unwell to engage with the intervention. 
Potential participants were approached by their care 
coordinator and asked if they were willing to discuss the 
trial with a research assistant. Information about the trial 
was shared verbally and via the participant information 
sheet.
All participants provided written informed consent. 
Participants were made aware that they could withdraw 
at any time, without any consequences for their treat-
ment.
Randomisation and masking
Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), via an 
automated, concealed, computer-generated allocation 
sequence generated by Norwich Clinical Trials Unit, to 
receive social recovery therapy plus early intervention 
services (intervention) or early intervention services 
alone (control). Randomisation was done in permuted 
blocks (sizes of four to six) and was stratified by sex and 
recruitment centre (Norfolk, Birmingham, Lancashire, 
and Sussex).
By necessity, participants were not masked to group 
allocation, but allocation was concealed from outcome 
assessors. An email notifi 
cation of the allocation was 
sent automatically to therapists and the trial manager. An 
email notification confirming that the participant had 
been randomly assigned (with no information about 
group allocation) was sent to the research assistant, thus 
keeping the trial team masked to group assignment. 
Therapists were also required to consider potential 
breaches in masking, and participants were reminded by 
assessors not to disclose treatment allocation. When 
masking was broken, another rater who was masked to 
group assignment assessed the participant at all 
subsequent timepoints.
Procedures
All participants received provision of early intervention 
services from specialist teams. The centres in 
Birmingham, Lancashire, Norfolk, and Sussex are all 
recognised centres of excellence for delivery of early 
intervention services. High fidelity to the early 
intervention services model indicated that the centres 
had the ability to deliver a comprehensive range of inter-
ventions.22 These interventions include intensive and 
assertive recovery-oriented case management, supported 
employment, peer support, group inter 
ventions, family 
work and CBT for psychosis, and psychiatric medications 
and medical and psychiatric monitoring. All participants 
had an early intervention services case manager who 
provided oversight of their care and remained in contact 
with the participant throughout the trial.
In the intervention group, early intervention services 
were augmented by social recovery therapy delivered by a 
therapist who was trained and supervised by the trial 
team. All therapists were supervised and accredited CBT 
therapists with experience in the relevant early 
intervention services. Social recovery therapy in this trial 
was designed and supervised to ensure it was done in 
partnership with the early intervention services.
DF, PF, and JH developed the specific therapeutic 
procedures used in social recovery therapy. These proce-
dures draw from our experience in the ISREP MRC Trial 
Platform14 and details are provided in our published 
manual.9 In brief, social recovery therapy is delivered in 
three stages.
Stage one involves engagement and development of a 
formulation, which comprises establishment of a 
working therapeutic relationship to facilitate engagement 
and identify a problem list. Alongside this approach is a 
detailed assessment of personal motivation and pre-
morbid hopes, expectations, and goals, which might have 
changed with respect to the effect of illness. Specific 
behavioural assessment is done in vivo to assess how 
symptoms affect activity. Links are identified between 
personally meaningful values and goals and achievable 
day-to-day activity targets. Stage two involves preparing 
for new activities, whereby the client and therapist work 
together to identify pathways to meaningful new 
activities. This strategy includes referral to relevant 
vocational agencies, education providers, and community

providers of social or sports activities. Cognitive work at 
this stage involves promoting a sense of agency and 
addressing hopelessness, feelings of stigma, and negative 
beliefs about self and others. Behavioural experiments 
start focusing on managing symptoms while engaging in 
activity. Stage three involves engagement in new 
activities, which involves the active promotion of social 
activity using behavioural experiments, and fostering 
feelings of mastery and agency. The behavioural 
experiments are progressively shaped to address specific 
problems presented by individuals. Therapists adopt an 
assertive outreach style of contact, most frequently 
visiting people at home or in community settings. 
Therapists are also encouraged to work systematically 
with family members, employers, and educational 
providers to discuss and overcome potential problems 
that could impede social recovery.
All trial therapists had formal training in CBT. 
Additionally, therapists received specialist training in the 
social recovery therapy approach via workshops and 
regular supervision sessions from the trial therapy team, 
including DF, PF, and JH. The Cognitive Therapy Scale-
Revised (CTS-R)23 was used to ensure therapist com-
petence. All therapists were required to score more than 
36 from tape-rated sessions and an average of more than 
3 on each item. Adherence to the social recovery therapy 
model was also assessed with a specific checklist. This 
method used a combination of independent expert rating 
of case notes and therapist ratings of individual sessions 
to assess techniques applied in individual sessions. A 
sufficient dose of therapy was defined as at least six 
sessions, including the presence of an assessment and 
formulation phase and active behavioural experiments 
occurring in at least two independent sessions.
Outcomes
Study assessments took place at baseline, 9 months 
(post-intervention), and 15 months (6 months’ follow-
up). Research assistants visited participants at home to 
undertake assessments and used flexible strategies to 
maintain engagement with participants, such as 
rearranging missed appointments to maintain partici-
pation. Inter-rater reliability on outcome measures was 
ensured via regular training sessions for research 
assistants and fortnightly telephone supervision meet-
ings to discuss assessment queries. 
The primary outcome was structured activity at 
9 months, as measured by the Time Use Survey adapted 
for work in this client group.21 The Time Use Survey is a 
semi-structured interview that enquires about time spent 
over the past month on work, education, voluntary work, 
leisure, sports, housework or chores, and child care. Time 
spent on each of the activities is calculated in terms of the 
average number of hours per week. The activities 
are summed to create two scores: constructive eco-
nomic activity (work, education, voluntary work, house-
work or chores, and child care) and structured activity 
(constructive economic activity plus leisure and sports 
activities). We adapted the Time Use Survey from a version 
developed by the UK Office for National Statistics,24 
enabling activity levels to be directly compared with age-
matched non-clinical peers. On average, a non-clinical 
group aged 16–36 years engage in 63·49 h of structured 
activity per week, and activity levels below 30 h are 
indicative of poor social functioning.21 The intraclass 
correlation coefficient for inter-rater reliability on the 
Time Use survey was 0·99.24 The Time Use Survey was 
also administered at 15 months. Structured activity and 
constructive economic activity at 15 months were recorded 
to explore the tenacity of the treatment effect; however, the 
statistical analysis plan is clear that the primary outcome 
for the study was the Time Use Survey at 9 months.
We used the PANSS25 to assess general psychopathology 
and negative symptoms as secondary outcomes. Other 
prespecified secondary outcomes at months 9 and 15 
were the Schedule for the Assessment of Negative 
Symptoms,26 the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS),27 
the 
Beck 
Depression 
Inventory-II,28 
the 
Beck 
Hopelessness Scale (BHS),29 the Meaning in Life 
Questionnaire (MLQ),30 and the Adult Trait Hope Scale.31
The Client Service Receipt Inventory32 and the 
EuroQol-5D33 were included as secondary outcomes in 
the trial protocol as part of a health economic evaluation 
of the intervention; results will be reported elsewhere.
A range of other scales were included to assess potential 
mediation of outcome. The Quality of Life Scale34 and the 
Role and Social Global Functioning Scales35 were 
included in the original trial protocol as secondary 
outcomes, but will be reported in another paper 
investigating mediation effects. Other mediator variables 
included the Schizotypal Symptoms Inventory,36 the Brief 
Core Schema Scales,37 and a range of neuropsychological 
variables. Data for these variables are also the subject of 
another paper investigating mediation effects.
Serious and adverse events were recorded over the 
course of the trial by use of standard operating procedures 
and reported to the National Health Service research 
ethics committee.
Statistical analysis
Data were collected according to the original funded 
protocol as submitted to and approved by the National 
Research Ethics Service Committee. A briefer protocol 
summarising only the primary and secondary outcomes 
was published as the registered trial protocol. We report 
all data collected in this paper.
Data were analysed according to a statistical analysis 
plan developed before unmasking of the data on 
Nov 6, 2015. The statistical analysis plan differed from 
the original ISCRTN trial protocol in that it was more 
specific in identifying the analysis of primary outcome as 
time use at 9 months, and also identified a range of 
secondary outcomes. These changes to the analysis plan 
took place after publication of the ISCTRN protocol in

June, 2012, after further methodological review and 
taking into account considerations of multi 
plicity for the 
analysis of primary outcome, in particular avoiding type 1 
error through multiplicity.38 These changes were 
discussed with and approved by the trial steering 
committee, and were recorded in the trial documentation.
The planned recruitment to the trial was based on a 
sample size of 150 individuals. A consensus group of 
clinicians and service users had conservatively estimated 
the minimum clinically significant gain on the primary 
outcome as 4 h on the Time Use Survey. With a standard 
deviation of 8 h and a minimum clinically important 
difference of 4 h, the study would have 90% power to 
detect a difference of 4 h to be significant at the 
conventional (two-sided) α level of 5%. The trial as 
designed had 80% power to find the same effect with 
120 evaluable patients.
The primary outcome was assessed with generalised 
mixed models, with an identity link and Gaussian mixed 
error. Each participant contributed two observations: 
one at baseline and one at 9 months. The model included 
indicators for whether the observation was at baseline or 
9 months, and whether or not the participant was 
randomly assigned in that period to receive the active 
intervention or control strategy. All models included the 
stratification variables as patient-level explanatory factors 
(sex and recruitment centre). Observations were linked 
with random intercept terms within a patient. 
Denominator degrees of freedom were derived from the 
number of patients. Supportive analyses were done with 
the separate components of the primary outcome. The 
primary outcome was analysed with residual (r-side) 
random effects rather than generalised (g-side) random 
effects. We did a further supportive analysis with 
baseline score as a patient-level explanatory variable.
We did the principal analysis in all available participants 
by intention to treat, with no imputation of missing 
values. Missing data were assumed to be missing not at 
random. Supportive analyses addressed missing data 
patterns by modelling jointly the continuous outcome 
score (with Gaussian error) and observed loss to follow-
up (with Bernoulli error) to describe the joint probability 
of the observed outcome. The joint (multivariate) models 
required the assumption that individuals with missing 
data have, on average, lower social functioning than 
those who do not drop out. This defensible assumption 
simply implies that loss to follow-up is a measure of 
lower scores on the scale of interest.
All analyses were done with SAS (version 9.4). This trial 
is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN61621571.

Results 
Between Oct 1, 2012, and June 20, 2014, we randomly 
assigned 155 participants (n=39 from Birmingham, 
n=53 from Lancashire, n=47 Norfolk, and n=16 Sussex) 
to receive social recovery therapy plus early intervention 
services (n=76) or early intervention services alone (n=79); 
the final sample comprised 154 patients after one participant 
withdrew and requested that their data be removed (figure).
Baseline characteristics were similar between groups 
(table 1). Participants were predominantly men, single, 
and of White British ethnicity (table 1). Length of illness 
and duration of untreated psychosis were variable, but, 
as per the study inclusion criteria, all participants had 
been engaged with early intervention services for 
12–30 months (table 1). Of note is the severity of social

disability, psychotic symptomatology, anxiety, and 
depression present in the sample at baseline (table 2).
Participants allocated to receive social recovery therapy 
plus early intervention services received a mean of 
16·49 sessions of social recovery therapy (SD 8·39; 
range 0–37). Competence in cognitive therapy as 
assessed by the CTS-R was excellent: of the random 
selection of therapy tapes rated indepen 
dently, 27 (90%) 
of 30 scored higher than the cutoff based on the therapy 
protocol. Adherence ratings on the social recovery CBT 
checklist indicated that 61 (81%) partici 
pants received a 
sufficient dose of social recovery therapy. Seven (9%) 
participants dropped out and did not have ratings 
available, and seven (9%) did not receive a sufficient 
dose.
143 (93%) participants had data for the primary 
outcome at 9 months (n=12 [7%] had missing data 
overall: n=3 in the social recovery therapy plus early 
intervention services group and n=9 in the early 
intervention services alone group; figure, table 2). The 
primary intention-to-treat analysis showed that social 
recovery therapy plus early intervention services was 
associated with a large and clinically important increase 
in struc 
tured activity of 8·1 h (95% CI 2·5–13·7; 
p=0·0050) compared with early intervention services 
alone (table 3). The supportive analysis using a repeated 
measure analysis (residual random effect) provided a 
similar esti 
mate (8·8 h, 95% CI 1·3–16·3; p=0·021). The 
sup 
portive analysis using baseline value as a patient-
level explanatory variable provided an estimate of 8·9 h 
(95% CI 1·4–16·5; p=0·021).
Despite considerable effort to retain participants, more 
data were missing for secondary outcomes than for 
primary outcomes, particularly for face-to-face assess-
ments (table 3). For time use at 15 months, data were 
missing for 26 (16%) participants overall; PANSS data 
were missing for 31 (20%) participants at 9 months and 
50 (35%) participants at 15 months (table 3). The pattern 
of missing data was biased, with more data missing in 
the control group than the intervention group (table 1), 
and was thus regarded as missing not at random.
Completer case analysis of treatment effects for time 
use and other secondary outcomes at 15 months showed 
no systematic differences between experimental condi-
tions (table 3). However, results of the joint models 
provided supportive evidence that, conditional on the 
assumption that loss to follow-up is associated with a 
poorer score on time use, the observed results are 
consistent with systematic differences in several 
secondary 
outcomes, 
including 
structured 
and 
constructive economic time use at 15 months, PANSS 
negative symptoms and general psychopathology 
at 9 months, SIAS at 9 months, BHS at 9 months 
and 15 months, Trait Hope at 15 months, and MLQ at 
15 months (table 3).
The independent data monitoring and ethics com-
mittee recorded no adverse or serious adverse events 
attributable to study therapy.
Discussion
The main aim of this study was to establish the presence 
of a treatment effect in a subgroup of patients who are 
known to be hard to treat, tend not to engage and have 
complex problems, and are the poorest outcome early 
intervention subgroup for whom no effective treatment 
currently exists. The study was powered to detect an 
effect on the primary outcome at 9 months; the result 
at that timepoint is clear and definitive. Participants who 
received social recovery therapy plus early intervention 
services had a large, significant, and clinically important

improvement of greater than 8 h per week in their level 
of structured activity compared with those receiving early 
intervention services alone. To our knowledge, this is the 
first study to show a significant improvement in 
functioning in this already highly disabled group. The 
size of the effect is twice that identified by consensus 
groups of users and clinicians as the minimum clinically 
important difference, and represents an amount of 
activity equivalent to a working day. Evidence from the 
primary analysis is therefore clear that social recovery 
therapy might have a clinically important effect in 
promoting earlier social recovery by comparison with 
ear 
ly intervention services alone.
The key issue for secondary outcomes was whether or 
not this effect persisted at 15 months. The main problem 
was a high rate of missing data at that point. This level 
of missingness meant that all analyses of secondary 
outcomes had low statistical power and were difficult to 
interpret. This population is incredibly challenging to 
retain in follow-up and the excellent response rate for the 
primary outcome is attributable to the efforts of the field 
researchers involved in the study. Missingness is clearly 
related to the outcomes of interest because availability for 
assessments by participants is related to social engage-
ment, and social recovery therapy specifically aims to 
increase social engagement. At all assessment points 
many more participants were available for follow-up 
assessments in the social recovery therapy group than in 
the early intervention services alone group. At 15 months, 
the proportion of participants lost to follow-up for 
structured activity was more than two-times higher in the 
control group than in the intervention group. This 
difference in itself might imply an effect of the 
intervention on engagement that most clinicians would 
regard as useful and worthy of examination in a future 
study. However, the pattern of differential missingness 
represents a chal 
lenge in interpretation of the effect at 
15 months because it might formally be regarded as 
missing not at random.
Results from completer analysis suggest that outcomes 
at 15 months were similar between the groups, but this 
finding might be biased if participants who dropped out 
were those with the worst outcomes. The joint models 
analysed simultaneously the outcome of interest and the 
binomial of missing values for that outcome, and were 
intended to provide a least biased assessment appropriate 
to the data being missing not at random. Modelling of 
the two values simultaneously in the multivariate model 
accounts for bias and provided a more encouraging 
overall p value for the difference between the two study 
groups than that from the principal analysis. Although 
reliant on the assumption that dropout equals worse 
outcome on the scale of interest, the joint modelling 
analyses provide encouragement that at least some of the 
effect of the experimental treatment on time use could 
remain at 15 months, albeit with a level of attenuation 
when compared with the similarly derived 9 month 
values. A limitation of the joint modelling approach is it 
provides a p value only for the combined pseudo-
likelihoods of the outcome and dropout, and cannot 
provide an updated estimate or confidence interval for 
the treatment effect.
A further question regarding the secondary outcomes 
was the effect on negative symptoms and general 
psychopathology as assessed by PANSS. Again, a high 
level of missing data does not allow a firm conclusion to 
be made about these outcomes and the completer 
analysis suggests there is no effect, but the joint

modelling, which attempts to account for missing data, 
suggests an effect on these outcomes at 9 months.
Of the individuals identified as meeting inclusion 
criteria, three-quarters consented and were randomised 
into the study. This level of recruitment was the result of 
intensive and assertive procedures. The research assis-
tants worked in an assertive outreach manner, visiting 
participants at home and engaging them into the study. 
The result was the recruitment of a group with very 
severe and stable social disability. The total time spent in 
activity by the group recruited for the study was less than 
12 h per week, compared with more than 60 h per week 
in an age-matched non-clinical sample.21 This non-
clinical sample comprised a group of young people with 
extreme social withdrawal who also had a wide range of 
other complex comorbidities, including high levels of 
treatment-resistant and residual positive psychotic 
symptoms, negative symptoms, anxiety and depression, 
as well as presence of current hopelessness and a lack of 
hope for the future.
The present findings extend those from the ISREP 
MRC Trial Platform Study, which compared the 
effectiveness of social recovery therapy versus treatment 
as usual and reported benefits at 9 months, 15 months, 
and 2 year follow-up, and associated gains in secondary 
outcomes and cost-effectiveness.14,20 Our study represents 
a more rigorous test in view of the comparator treatment-
as-usual intervention of early intervention services—a 
highly active treatment that consisted of high-quality 
provision of early intervention services in sites with good 
fidelity to the early intervention services model, as 
recommended by guidelines from the National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence for psychosis and 
schizophrenia.39 Improvements were observed in both 
treatment groups, but with differential improvement in 
the social recovery therapy group.
A strength of this study was good internal and external 
validity of the trial design for the primary outcome. The 
study was done with a high degree of rigour, with all 
researchers and therapists involved in the study

receiving regular supervision and with routine checks 
on inter-rater reliability and adherence to the therapy 
model.
A limitation of the study was that it was compromised 
by the level and pattern of missing data in the secondary 
outcomes, albeit one that we addressed by use of joint 
modelling. The characteristics of the target group in 
this study, as a difficult to engage and extremely 
withdrawn sample, represent a challenge to researchers, 
especially when follow-up assessments are reliant on 
face-to-face communications. Future studies in this area 
might maximise rate of follow-up by focusing on hard 
proxy variables of engagement in services that could be 
derived 
from 
records 
rather 
than 
face-to-face 
assessments, especially as engagement is of itself an 
important outcome in this population. A further 
limitation of this study was that many of the secondary 
outcomes had wide confidence intervals (an indication 
of low statistical power), suggesting low precision or 
uncertainty in the estimation of treatment effects. 
Furthermore, the study was by necessity single blind, 
and thus could be affected by the experience of the 
participant in receiving therapy.
The target population for this study was a particularly 
high-severity group of young people with first-episode 
psychosis who are likely to have poor long-term 
outcomes. This study provides encouragement for 
practitioners in early intervention services to focus on 
this subgroup who are often neglected. Our results also 
suggest that social recovery therapy techniques could be 
a useful addition in this group. This is the first study to 
show benefits in this population. The effect size after 
treatment is clearly of clinical benefit, especially given 
the extreme social withdrawal present at baseline. 
Furthermore, the differential dropout rate between 
groups, with many more participants available for follow-
up in the treatment group than in the control group, 
implies benefits on maintenance of engagement in the 
treatment group, which could be important to assess as 
an outcome in future work. The degree to which the 
treatment results in persistence of gains and longer term 
effects likewise deserves further study. Joint modelling 
aimed to account for the bias associated with the 
differential pattern of missingness in the analysis and 
suggests the potential for persistence of effects in the 
long term, but because this was a supple 
mentary 
analysis, persistence of gains cannot be esta 
blished. A 
larger more definitive trial is required to examine long-
term effects more clearly. The extent to which 
interventions of this type might be enhanced by top-up 
therapy or a greater number of sessions over a longer 
duration could be worthy of further scrutiny in view of 
evidence from similar studies in adults with more 
established schizophrenia.16
