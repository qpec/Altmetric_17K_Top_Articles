Abstract
Introduction
Current physical activity guidelines recommend that adults parti-
cipate weekly in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity equi-
valent aerobic physical activity to achieve substantial health bene-
fits. We used a nationally representative sample of data of US
adults to estimate the percentage of deaths attributable to levels of
physical  activity  that  were  inadequate  to  meet  the  aerobic
guideline.
Methods
Data from the 1990 to 1991 National Health Interview Survey for
adults aged 25 years or older were linked with mortality data up
until December 31, 2011, from the National Death Index (N =
67,762 persons and 18,796 deaths). Results from fully adjusted
Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ra-
tios and population attributable fractions for inadequate levels of
physical activity (ie, less than 150 minutes per week of moderate-
intensity equivalent aerobic activity).
Results
Overall, 8.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.4–10.2) of deaths
were attributed to inadequate levels of physical activity. The per-
centage of deaths attributed to inadequate levels was not signific-
ant for adults aged 25 to 39 years (−0.2%; 95% CI, −8.8% to
7.7%) but was significant for adults aged 40 to 69 years (9.9%;
95% CI, 7.2%–12.6%) and adults aged 70 years or older (7.8%;
95% CI, 4.9%–10.7%).
Conclusions
A significant portion of deaths was attributed to inadequate levels
of physical activity. Increasing adults’ physical activity levels to
meet current guidelines is likely one way to reduce the risk of pre-
mature death in the United States.
Introduction
Regular participation in physical activity reduces the risk of dying
prematurely (1). The 2008 US Department of Health and Human
Services Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend
that adults participate in at least 150 minutes of moderate intens-
ity-equivalent aerobic activity weekly for substantial health bene-
fits, and for additional and more extensive health benefits adults
should increase this to more than 300 minutes per week (2). Popu-
lation levels of physical activity inadequate to meet guidelines can
place a burden on the US population in terms of premature mortal-
ity.
The population attributable fraction (PAF) (3) provides an estim-
ate of the percentage of deaths that could be averted if people who
do not meet the guideline were active at levels consistent with the
guideline. Studies have estimated the PAF for physical inactivity
by using an equation that combines estimates of risk from one
source and prevalence from another source (4–7). Combining es-
timates across sources can bias results if the characteristics of the
2 source populations differ, if the measure of physical activity dif-
fers across sources, or if confounding is not accounted for (3,8).
Estimating the PAF from a survival analysis conducted in a single
population can help overcome these biases. No study has estim-
ated the PAF for inadequate levels of physical activity (using cri-
teria based on guidelines) (2) from a survival analysis of a nation-
ally representative sample.

 Evidence of the association between physical activity and mortal-
ity comes from studies focused on middle-aged adults and mainly
includes adults aged 40 years or older, with few data available for
adults aged 80 years or older (1,7). Researchers who examined the
influence of age on the association between physical activity and
mortality suggested that the association generally gets stronger
with increasing age (9–11). However, one study with 42 years of
follow-up found that the PAFs for physical inactivity were consist-
ent across age groups, ranging from 7.3% (aged 20–44 y) to 9.1%
(aged ≥65 y) (11).
Our study had 2 objectives. The first was to examine the influence
that physical activity level (defined using the 2008 Physical Activ-
ity Guidelines for Americans aerobic criteria) has on mortality in a
nationally representative sample of the US population and to ex-
amine this association by age group. The second was to estimate
the proportion of deaths attributable to inadequate levels of phys-
ical activity in US adults.
Methods
Data
We analyzed data from the 1990 and 1991 National Health Inter-
view Survey (NHIS), which were linked to the National Death In-
dex (NDI) (12,13). Vital status information was available from
January 1, 1990, through December 31, 2011.
The NHIS collects basic health and demographic information on
all household members; additional information, such as that for
physical activity, is collected on one randomly selected adult
through a face-to-face survey (12). NHIS interviews were com-
pleted by 84,836 (1990, n = 41,104; 1991, n = 43,732) adult re-
spondents. The response rates for the adult supplements were
83.4% in 1990 and 87.8% in 1991 (12). Of the 84,836 respond-
ents, 83,971 (99%) were matched with NDI records and had
known vital status information (number of decedents = 22,305)
(13).
In 1990 and 1991, there were 74,346 adult respondents of the
NHIS sample aged 25 years or older with a matched NDI record
(22,101 decedents). First, 24 adults (12 decedents) with missing
data on date of birth were excluded. Second, we excluded 3,685
adults (2,338 decedents) who were physically disabled or whose
disability status was unknown and, consequently, were not asked
all physical activity questions. Third, we excluded 2,838 adults
(918 decedents) who had missing physical activity or covariate
data. Finally, we excluded 37 adults who died in the same quarter
in which they completed the NHIS interview (final sample, n =
67,762; decedents, 18,796).
Measures
Physical activity assessment. 
Physical activity assessment. In the 1990 and 1991 surveys, parti-
cipants were asked if they had engaged in any exercises, sports, or
physically active hobbies in the past 2 weeks (14). If they respon-
ded yes, they were asked how often they did each activity during
the preceding 2 weeks and the average number of minutes they
participated each time. We included participation in 13 physical
activities (ie, walking; jogging or running; gardening or yard
work; aerobics or aerobic dancing; tennis; biking; swimming; bas-
ketball; baseball or softball; football; soccer; volleyball; and hand-
ball, racquetball, or squash) (14).
We categorized activities as moderate-intensity or vigorous-intens-
ity for each person. This was done by first estimating a 60% max-
imal oxygen uptake (VO2max) value for each adult on the basis of
standard equations that account for sex and age (15). An adult’s
estimated 60% VO2max was compared with an assigned Metabolic
Equivalent of Task (MET) value (16). If the MET value of the
activity was higher than the adult’s estimated 60% VO2max, then
the activity was categorized as vigorous intensity; otherwise the
activity was categorized as moderate intensity.
A minute of vigorous-intensity activity was counted as 2 minutes
of moderate-intensity activity to calculate minutes of moderate-in-
tensity equivalent activity (2). Using minutes of moderate-intens-
ity equivalent activity and guidelines criteria, adults were categor-
ized into a 4-level physical activity variable: inactive (no physical
activity reported in the preceding 2 weeks), insufficiently active
(some activity but <150 min/wk), sufficiently active (150–300
min/wk), and highly active (>300 min/wk). Adults were then cat-
egorized into a 3-level variable: inactive, insufficiently active, and
active (combining sufficiently and highly active [ie, ≥150 min/
wk]) (2).
Time scales.
Time scales. The public-use data set provided the month and year
of birth, quarter and year of the interview, and quarter and year of
death. To create the time scale, the fifteenth day of the birth month
was used along with the midpoint for the interview and midpoint
of the death quarter.
Covariates.
Covariates. In the NHIS, interviewers assessed sex, race/ethnicity,
education, cigarette smoking, and hypertension (12). Categorical
variables were created for each of these covariates: sex (male, fe-
male), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
other), education level (less than high school graduate, high school
graduate, some college, college graduate), smoking status (never
smoker, former smoker, current smoker), and hypertension (yes,
no). Body mass index (BMI, calculated as reported weight in kilo-

 grams divided by the square of reported height in meters [kg/m2])
was  categorized  as  underweight  (<18.5),  normal  weight
(18.5–24.9), overweight (25.0–29.9), or obese (≥30) (17).
Statistical analysis
We compared the prevalence of physical activity levels for adults
who died with those for adults who survived to the end of follow-
up by using adjusted Wald tests; significance was set at P < .05.
We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ra-
tios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by level of physic-
al activity, while adjusting for sex, race/ethnicity, education level,
smoking status, hypertension, and BMI category. We used sensit-
ivity analyses to examine all estimates after removing adults who
died during the first 2 years of follow-up.
We made an a priori decision to examine the association between
physical activity and mortality by age, and testing the interaction
between age and physical activity level supported this decision.
We began with 3 age groups (25–39 y, 40–79 y, and ≥80 y) be-
cause previous research has focused on adults aged 40 years or
older, with minimal data for those aged 80 years or older (1,7). We
decided to use a cut-off of 70 years or older for the highest age
group, because we found the association of activity with mortality
for those aged 70 to 79 was more similar to adults in the oldest age
group (≥80 y) than to those aged 40 to 69. Our final age groups
were 25 to 39 years, 40 to 69 years, and 70 years or older. Age
was used as the time scale in the Cox models, with age at death or
the end of follow-up (December 31, 2011) as the survival time and
age at entry into the study as left-censoring (18). The Breslow
method was used for handling tied failure times (19).
All analyses were conducted using STATA (StataCorp LP) ver-
sion 13. PAFs and their corresponding 95% CIs were calculated
directly from the results of the fully adjusted Cox models (20).
HRs were not significantly different for the sufficiently and highly
active levels for any age group; therefore, the 3-level physical
activity variable was used to estimate PAFs. We applied survey
weights and adjusted for the complex sample design of the NHIS
(12).
Results
Overall, the prevalence of physical inactivity was significantly
higher among adults who died than those who survived through
follow-up, while prevalence of both insufficient and sufficient
activity was significantly higher among those who survived than
those who died (Table 1). The same significant differences were
observed in adults aged 25 to 39 years and 40 to 69 years (Figure).
In adults aged 70 or older, prevalence of inactivity was signific-
antly higher, and prevalence of being highly active was lower,
among those who died than among those who survived.

of the year as interviewed. Individuals were categorized into 4 activity levels:
inactive (no physical activity reported in the past 2 weeks), insufficiently active
(some activity but <150 min/wk of moderate-intensity equivalent activity),
sufficiently active (150–300 min/wk of moderate-intensity equivalent activity),
and highly active (>300 min/wk of moderate-intensity equivalent activity).

When physical activity was categorized into 4 levels and models
adjusted for covariates, physical activity was significantly associ-
ated with mortality for adults aged 40 to 69 (adjusted Wald P
<.001) and 70 or older (P <.001), while the association was not
significant for adults aged 25 to 39 at baseline (P = .48) (Table 2).
Among adults aged 40 to 69 and 70 or older, inactive adults had
an increased risk of premature death compared with sufficiently
active adults. For adults aged 40 to 69, the difference was also sig-
nificant for those insufficiently active versus sufficiently active.
For adults aged 25 to 39, inactive adults compared with those suf-
ficiently active had an increased risk of premature death in the un-
adjusted models; however, once we controlled models for demo-
graphic characteristics, this increased risk was no longer signific-
ant. No significant differences between those who were highly act-
ive versus sufficiently active were observed for any age group. All

 findings were similar if adults who died in the first 2 years of fol-
low-up were excluded, except while physical activity level re-
mained a significant variable in the model for those 70 or older (P
= .001), the comparison between the inactive group and suffi-
ciently active group was no longer significant (P = .13).
When physical activity level was categorized into 3 levels and the
comparison group was active adults, findings were similar (Table
2). Results were similar for adults aged 40 to 69 and 70 or older,
with both inactive and insufficiently active adults versus active
adults having an increased risk of premature death. There was no
significant association (P = .45) between the 3-level physical
activity variable and mortality for adults aged 25 to 39. Findings
were similar if those who died in the first 2 years of follow-up
were excluded.
Overall, 8.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.4%–10.2%) of
deaths were attributed to inactive and insufficiently active levels
of physical activity (ie, levels of physical activity inadequate to
meet the minimal guideline) (Table 3). For adults aged 40 to 69,
9.9% of deaths were attributed to inadequate levels of physical
activity, and for adults aged 70 or older, 7.8% of deaths were at-
tributed to inadequate levels of physical activity. The percentage
of deaths attributed to inadequate levels of physical activity was
not significantly different for adults aged 25 to 39. PAFs de-
creased after removal of adults who died in the first 2 years, but all
significant findings remained significant.
Discussion
In a nationally representative sample of nondisabled US adults, in-
adequate levels of physical activity were associated with an in-
creased risk of premature death. Overall, 8.3% of deaths in nondis-
abled adults 25 or older were attributed to inadequate levels of
physical activity. The percentage of deaths attributed to inad-
equate physical activity was significant for adults aged 40 to 69
(9.9%) and among adults aged 70 or older (7.8%). On the basis of
these findings, increasing adults’ physical activity to levels con-
sistent with current guidelines and Healthy People 2020 object-
ives may decrease the risk of premature death in the United States
(2,21).
When comparing our results to those of studies that examined the
association between higher levels of physical activity and overall
mortality, we found that our estimates were similar or lower
(10,22–24). For example, in a meta-analysis when studies using 3
levels of physical activity were summarized, the combined relat-
ive risk for the most active group was 0.78 (22). Taking the in-
verse would give an estimate of 1.28, which is very close to our
estimate of 1.24 for adults aged 40 to 69, and a little higher than
our estimate of 1.19 for adults aged 70 or older. A pooled analysis
of 6 studies from the National Cancer Institute Cohort Consorti-
um (median entry age, 62 y; range, 21–98 y; median follow-up,
14.2 y) reported a hazard ratio of 0.80 (inverse, 1.25) for those
performing less than the guideline recommends compared with
those who were inactive; 0.69 (inverse, 1.45) for those performing
1 to 2 times the recommended amount; and 0.63 (inverse, 1.59) for
those performing 3 to 5 times the recommended amount (23).
Comparing our PAF estimates with those of other studies is diffi-
cult because of the various methods and measures of physical
activity used. One study that combined physical activity preval-
ence estimates from surveillance systems with risk estimates from
the literature reported a PAF for mortality relative to physical in-
activity (defined as an activity level insufficient to meet recom-
mendations) in the United States of 10.8% (95% CI, 8.6%–13.1%)
(7). This estimate may be higher, because the estimates of risks
came mainly from studies of physical activity and all-cause mor-
tality in people aged 40 years or older, with limited data for those
aged 80 or older (7). This may be the reason that it is closer to our
estimate of 9.9% for those aged 40 to 69 years. Another study us-
ing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey that were linked with mortality data attributed 10.9% (95%
CI, 3.0%–18.7%) of deaths to non-ideal physical activity (ideal is
defined as participation in moderate-intensity [≥5 times/wk] or
vigorous-intensity  [≥3  times/wk]  aerobic  physical  activity);
however, these levels are not equivalent to current guidelines, and
that study included respondents who were physically disabled.
However, even with these differences, our estimate was not prac-
tically different from that of that study, given their estimate and
wide CI (25).
We found no association between physical activity level and mor-
tality in the younger age group. It may be that our follow-up peri-
od was not long enough, especially to capture deaths associated
with chronic conditions most closely associated with physical
activity level. In our cohort, only 4.8% of adults aged 25 to 39 at
baseline died during follow-up. One study that examined this asso-
ciation among those aged 20 to 44 years did find an association
between physical activity and mortality; however, this study had
follow-up data for 42 years (11). Researchers may wish to exam-
ine this association in younger age groups with a longer follow-up
period and multiple measures of physical activity during the fol-
low-up period.
Our findings for adults aged 70 or older were consistent with those
in adults aged 40 to 69. Although the difference in the magnitude
of the association of the HRs or the PAF between the 2 groups was
not large, the association may have been diluted in those aged 70
or older. These adults may have decreased their physical activity
level as they aged (26), so we may have had older adults in our
sample who previously were active and became less active. This

 may have resulted in the measure of physical activity in the older
age group being an underestimation of their lifetime activity and
thereby a dilution of the association observed for the older age
group.
Our study has limitations. First, we used observational data, which
may have biased the observed associations by introducing con-
founding factors. We attempted to reduce such bias by controlling
for several factors; however, we were not able to control for all
potential confounding factors and may have over-adjusted for oth-
ers. For example, participation in other unhealthy behaviors, such
as poor diet, may be related to physical inactivity (27). Because
some variables (eg, hypertension, BMI) may be intermediate vari-
ables on the causal pathway between physical activity and mortal-
ity, controlling for these variables may have been an over-adjust-
ment. We did not adjust for additional chronic diseases (eg, heart
disease, diabetes) because of this concern. Second, NHIS physical
activity data are derived from self-reported information, and re-
porting bias can result in high estimates of physical activity (28).
However, individuals overestimating their physical activity would
lead to a more conservative estimate of this association. Third, the
physical activity measure was based only on leisure-time activity,
which may have resulted in an underestimation of physical activ-
ity levels if individuals’ work hours were considered. Fourth, only
a single baseline assessment was available. A longer follow-up
period is desirable to minimize censoring; however, the longer fol-
low-up time also means that there is a longer interval between
baseline physical activity assessment and the event. In a previous
study, researchers concluded that the relative risk of mortality as-
sociated with physical inactivity is underestimated when derived
from a prospective study using a single baseline measurement
(29). Finally, reverse causation may explain some of our associ-
ation, because adults may have been ill at the time of the baseline
measure, potentially influencing their physical activity level and
risk of mortality. This was addressed in 2 ways. First, adults iden-
tified as physically disabled or who died in the same quarter of the
year as interviewed were excluded from the study. Second, we
conducted sensitivity analyses that removed adults who died in the
first 2 years of follow up, and results were similar.
Our study also has strengths. First, the prospective cohort design
of the study allowed us to better examine causality. Second, in-
formation on many covariates was available, which allowed us to
adjust our models for confounding factors. Third, our physical
activity levels were consistent with current guidelines. Finally, the
NHIS is nationally representative and has near complete mortality
follow-up for a long period. Because our goal was to estimate the
percentage of deaths associated with inadequate physical activity
levels in the US population, nationally representative data are
preferable, and the near-complete follow-up ensured the generaliz-
ability of our study findings.
Levels of physical activity inadequate to meet current guidelines
are associated with a significant proportion of deaths in US adults.
Increasing adults’ physical activity levels to meet guidelines and
Healthy People 2020 objectives is a way to reduce the risk of pre-
mature death in the United States.

b Individuals were categorized into 4 activity levels based on guidelines: inactive (no physical activity reported in the past 2 weeks), insufficiently active (some activ-
ity but less than 150 min/wk of moderate-intensity equivalent activity), sufficiently active (150–300 min/wk of moderate-intensity equivalent activity), and highly
active (>300 min/wk of moderate-intensity equivalent activity).
