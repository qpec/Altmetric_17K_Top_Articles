Sleeping sickness is a fatal disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei, a unicellular parasite that
lives in the bloodstream and interstitial spaces of peripheral tissues and the brain. Patients
have altered sleep/wake cycles, body temperature, and endocrine profiles, but the underlying
causes are unknown. Here, we show that the robust circadian rhythms of mice become phase
advanced upon infection, with abnormal activity occurring during the rest phase. This
advanced phase is caused by shortening of the circadian period both at the behavioral level as
well as at the tissue and cell level. Period shortening is T. brucei specific and independent of
the host immune response, as co-culturing parasites with explants or fibroblasts also
shortens the clock period, whereas malaria infection does not. We propose that T. brucei
causes an advanced circadian rhythm disorder, previously associated only with mutations in
clock genes, which leads to changes in the timing of sleep.

 S
leeping sickness is one of the major neglected tropical
diseases, with an incidence of 10,000 new cases per year,
threatening more than 60 million people in sub-Saharan
Africa1,2. Sleeping sickness is caused by the unicellular and
extracellular parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which can be found in
the bloodstream and interstitial spaces of the adipose tissue and
skin, but eventually invades the brain, leading to coma and death
if untreated1,3–5. Although patients experience a variety of
symptoms6,7, the hallmark of sleeping sickness is the disruption
of the sleep pattern. Patients experience somnolence during the
day and insomnia at night, but with total time spent sleeping
similar to healthy individuals8–11. The fact that the sleep/wake
cycle disruption in patients reverts to normal upon treatment9,
and that autopsies show that patients who die of sleeping sickness
lack neuro-degeneration12,13, suggests that the presence of para-
sites, rather than neuronal death, is the cause of these symptoms.
This curious daily sleep/wake cycle disruption, together with
changes in body temperature regulation and disrupted timing of
endocrine secretion7,8,12,14, indicates that sleeping sickness may
be a circadian clock rhythm disorder.
Here, we report that T. brucei causes a circadian rhythm dis-
order in mice, recapitulating the circadian behavior and body
temperature changes in humans. Mechanistically, we show that T.
brucei infection shortens the period of the mouse circadian
activity rhythm at the organismal level as well as at the cellular
and molecular level. This acceleration of the host clock is not
observed with other infections and can be reproduced in vitro,
indicating that it is probably caused by the direct interaction of
cells with the parasite or with a parasite molecule.
Results
Infected mice are active during the resting phase. In mammals,
neurons within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypo-
thalamus orchestrate diverse circadian physiological functions
including the sleep/wake cycle, core body temperature, and meta-
bolism15. Given that the patients experience somnolence during the
day and insomnia at night8–11, we set out to test whether T. brucei
infection affected circadian behavior. We measured the locomotor
activity of the infected mice using running-wheel activity, which is
a robust and reliable SCN-driven circadian clock output16. Mice
were individually housed and running-wheel activity monitored
with an automated system. Arising from the rotation of the Earth,
light cycles are the most important daily environmental cue to
which the circadian system can synchronize or entrain. To ensure
that the internal circadian clock of mice prior to infection was
normal, mice were first entrained to light/dark cycles (LD) for
seven days and then housed in constant darkness (DD) for
10 days16. As expected for nocturnal animals, prior to infection,
every mouse had a normal circadian rhythm and was active during
the nighttime in LD, and this rhythmic behavior persisted in DD
with a shorter period (approximately 23.7 h, known as “free run-
ning period”). Mice were then injected on day 0 either with T.
brucei parasites or with vehicle solution (culture medium) (Fig. 1a).
We observed that infected mice were four-fold less active than
control mice (Fig. 1c, d), in particular in the periods following high
parasitemia, when anemia is ~50–70% (6–10 days post-infection,
Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). This sickness-like activity reduction is
likely due to exacerbated inflammation as a result of high para-
sitemia, as it has been shown that injection of pro-inflammatory
cytokines reduces running-wheel activity17. It is interesting to note
that although infected animals always start running at the begin-
ning of nighttime, the time spent running changes over days,
leading to modulatory ‘waves of activity’ (Fig. 1c). This is curious
since this infection is known for its waves of parasitemia (Sup-
plementary Fig. 1a).
In
humans,
T.
brucei
causes
relatively
low
and
often
undetectable parasitemia. In order to mimic this in mice, animals
were treated around day 21 post-infection with suramin (20 mg/
kg), a drug that does not cross the blood brain barrier and thus
only kills parasites in the periphery18. As a result, animals do not
develop overt disease and survival is prolonged with undetectable
parasitemia (Fig. 1b). When we treated mice with suramin, we
observed that infected mice still run 1.5-fold less than control
mice (Fig. 1e, f). But strikingly, infected mice had abnormal levels
of activity during the daytime (~15% of activity occurs during
daytime after day 50, as compared to ~1% of activity in control
mice; Fig. 1e, g and Supplementary Fig. 1d). In particular, similar
to the circadian activity disruption observed in patients19, four
out of 14 mice ran more than 25% of their daily activity during
the rest period after day 50 post-infection (Fig. 1g). This daytime
activity increase is maintained even when considering the
absolute number of wheel revolutions during the daytime, when
infected mice run 4.5-fold more than controls (Supplementary
Fig. 1e). This daytime activity is very unusual since the inhibitory
masking effects of light on running-wheel behavior are generally
very strong20,21.
Highest core temperature shifted from nighttime to daytime.
Since the SCN neurons drive not only activity rhythms but also
circadian body temperature fluctuations22, we assessed the effects
of T. brucei infection on temperature by measuring core body
temperature with an implanted temperature sensor22. As expec-
ted, in control animals we observed a circadian oscillation of high
temperature during the night and low during the day. In infected
animals, we observed an initial fever-like peak that lasted two
days matching the first peak of parasitemia (day 4–6 post-infec-
tion), followed by a normal temperature oscillation (Fig. 1h, i).
However, around 60 days post-infection, the highest core
temperature shifted from the night to daytime, resembling the
shift we observed in the wheel-running activity (Fig. 1h, i).
This implanted sensor system also measures general cage activity,
which confirmed that at later stages in the infection, general
cage activity was increased during the rest (daytime) phase
(Supplementary Fig. 1f).
Interestingly, beginning soon after infection, the circadian
amplitude of the temperature rhythm was reduced in infected
mice (Fig. 1j). Additionally, infected mice showed a hypothermic
period later in the infection, below the minimum of normal
physiological range of 36−38.5 °C22, with lower temperature
dropping below 34 °C (Fig. 1k). Thus, both circadian activity
rhythms and body temperature rhythms are affected in a parallel
manner by T. brucei infection.
T. brucei infection affects both circadian sleep and feeding.
Sleeping sickness is characterized by increased sleep during the
daytime but overall patients spend the same amount of time
sleeping as healthy individuals9. Using an automated video ana-
lysis system (CleverSys), we analyzed feeding and sleeping of
control and infected mice at days 20, 65, 85, and 95 post-
infection. Later in the infection (days 85 and 95), infected mice
showed a disrupted feeding pattern and spent more time in a
sleep-like state during the active phase than control animals, even
though they did not rest more over the 24-h day (Supplementary
Fig. 2). This is consistent with a shift in the circadian distribution
of sleep that is concordant with the change in the phase
distribution of circadian activity and temperature rhythms.
Together these results show that mice infected by T. brucei
exhibit a similar disruption of circadian activity, sleep, and daily
temperature as described in humans, thus validating this as a
model for human sleeping sickness.

 T. brucei infection shortens the circadian activity period. To
determine whether T. brucei interferes with the mouse circadian
rhythm, we repeated the same experiments but with mice
maintained in DD, when the internal circadian clock controls the
timing of rhythmic locomotor behavior. In the absence of light as
a temporal cue, the circadian clock imposes a stable wheel-
running activity with a period of ~23.7 h, with more activity
during the nighttime (Fig. 2a–d)23. We infected mice in the dark
and let the infection progress in DD. We observed that running-
wheel activity period was ~30 min shorter in infected mice than
in control mice (Fig. 2a–d). As a result of this period shortening,
after 20 days post-infection, infected mice start to run 12 h earlier

 than control mice. Unlike control mice, whose period is stable
over time, infected mice showed a progressively shorter period
(Fig. 2b–d and Supplementary Fig. 1g): from ~23.5 h in the first
10 days to ~23.1 h between days 70 and 80. Interestingly, this
shorter period was detected immediately in the first 10 days post-
infection, when very few or no parasites can be detected in the
brain (Supplementary Fig. 1c)24,25. These results demonstrate
that T. brucei shortens circadian period in vivo and suggest that
early changes in circadian behavior may not be exclusively due to
the presence of parasites in the brain, but rather a consequence of
a peripheral signal, such as a metabolite or hormone that feed-
backs onto the master clock.
Infected mice have advanced circadian rhythms. Infected mice
showed increased activity during resting phase after 50 days (in
LD cycles) and have shorter circadian period than controls when
maintained in DD (Figs. 1 and 2). To determine whether the
increased daytime activity in LD was due to an underlying phase
advance of the circadian rhythms, we transferred mice to DD for
15 days starting on day 60, followed by a period of LD to test
ability of re-entrainment and a second dark period. As expected,
whenever control animals were released into DD, they main-
tained their normal free running period (~23.7 h) with activity
onsets occurring near the beginning of the dark period at Cir-
cadian Time 12 (CT12; Fig. 2e, f). When transferred back to
LD12:12, control mice were able to re-entrain rapidly and ran
exclusively during the nighttime (Fig. 2e). In contrast, most
infected mice showed a phase advance when released into DD
with activity onsets occurring before lights out (average phase:
CT12.35 in controls and CT11.32 in infected mice, Fig. 2f). Many
infected mice could not immediately re-entrain when returned
back to LD12:12 (Fig. 2g) and some mice failed to entrain after
the second DD episode (Fig. 2e bottom right panel). These results
highlight once more that the circadian clock of infected mice is
disrupted since these mice show (i) a phase advance when
released into DD, (ii) impaired re-entrainment to LD, and (iii)
period shortening; all characteristics that are absent in healthy
uninfected mice.
Ex vivo highly parasitized tissues show shorter period. Within
the neurons of the SCN and virtually every cell of our body, there
is a circadian transcription–translation feedback loop comprised
of a core set of genes: the activators Clock and Bmal1 and their
repressors encoded by Per1/Per2 and Cry1/Cry226. This loop
takes 24 h to be completed, leading to the rhythmic expression of
multiple downstream genes that will then impact a variety of
cellular pathways. Since both behavior and core temperature are
regulated by clock genes15, we investigated whether the advanced
circadian rhythm could be explained by changes in the expression
of core clock genes. For this, we infected Per2tm1Jt mice that
express a PERIOD2::LUCIFERASE (PER2::LUC) fusion reporter
protein27 and collected multiple organs to measure circadian
PER2 expression ex vivo. Peripheral organs of control mice
showed rhythmic oscillations of PER2 expression (Fig. 3a, b).
When mice were sacrificed six days post-infection, no changes in
period were detected, but interestingly the phase of the adipose
tissue (AT) depots was advanced (Fig. 3c). To test whether this
change in PER2 expression was stronger once more parasites have
infiltrated the organs4, we tested the expression of PER2::LUC in
those same organs on day 20. At 20 days post-infection, most
infected organs kept oscillating with normal circadian parameters
of phase, damping and period similar to that of the controls
(Fig. 3a–c and Supplementary Fig. 3a, see Methods section).
Adipose tissue, however, which has the highest parasite load4, had
~2 h shorter period (Fig. 3a, b and Supplementary Fig. 3b). This
tissue also showed a phase advance as observed on day 6 and
notably remained cycling, with damping remaining unaffected.
This was observed in both gonadal and perirenal adipose tissue
depots (Fig. 3b). The period shortening observed on day 20 and
phase advance for both days 6 and 20 in adipose tissue suggests
that even though on day 6 the presence of parasites was not
enough to shorten the period, these depots were already phase
advanced relative to controls, and as the parasite load increased, a
shorter period was detectable, even ex vivo.
Eliminating parasites from tissues reverses period shortening.
To test whether the shorter period of infected adipose tissue could
be reversed by eliminating parasites, we treated animals with
suramin and assessed PER2::LUC circadian rhythms at day 60.
When parasites were eliminated from peripheral organs, the
period of the adipose tissue was rescued and became similar to
control organs (Fig. 3d, e), suggesting that the shorter period was
a consequence of high parasite load. Suramin cannot eliminate
parasites from the central nervous system and remarkably, on day
60 the period of the SCN of infected mice was 30 min shorter
than control SCNs (Fig. 3d–f and Supplementary Fig. 3b). This is
particularly interesting because it was approximately on day 60 in
LD conditions that we observed phase advances of the circadian
activity and body temperature of infected mice (Fig. 1e, g).
Together these data suggest that cumulative parasite load in the
tissues leads to changes in the period of circadian clock, which
can be reversed upon treatment with suramin for parasite
elimination.
Plasmodium infection does not change host circadian period.
The molecular clock is driven by a transcription–translation
feedback loop. To test to what extent the clock was affected, we
assessed the expression of other clock genes by infecting mice

extracting RNA from the organs21. We measured the mRNA
expression of genes involved in the molecular clock: transcrip-
tional activator Bmal1, transcriptional repressor Per1, and an
immediate downstream target of the clock D site of albumin
promoter (albumin D-box) binding protein (Dbp). As expected,
even after 20 days in DD, clock gene expression in control mice
cycled in liver, adipose tissue, and hypothalamic area of the brain,
where the SCN is located (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 4). In

 activates transcription of Per1 and Dbp, whose maximal expres-
sion occurs at CT8–12. In sharp contrast, the circadian transcript
profile of clock genes is highly disrupted when mice are infected
with T. brucei (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 4) with an
abnormal phase of Per1 expression in the liver, a lower amplitude
of the Dbp rhythm in the hypothalamus, a dramatic down-
regulation of mRNA levels of most clock genes, and oscillations
becoming undetectable in the adipose tissue.
To test whether the disruption of clock gene circadian
expression is a specific effect of T. brucei infection and not due
to an immune response to a parasitic infection, we infected mice
with a rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium chabaudi. Both
parasite species cause chronic infections in the mouse, with
comparable immune responses and similar tissue tropism
patterns (Fig. 4c, d)28. We infected mice with P. chabaudi and
collected organs every 4 h to measure transcript levels of the same
clock genes by qPCR. We observed that the mRNA expression
profile of clock genes in the liver was similar in both control and
Plasmodium-infected mice. However, in the adipose tissue,
expression of clock genes was in general lower in Plasmodium-
infected mice (Fig. 4b). This is likely due to inflammation, since
inflammation upregulates TNF and it has been previously
demonstrated that TNF impairs expression of clock genes in
synchronized NIH 3T3 fibroblasts17. We confirmed that infec-
tions led to upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF
and IL-1) and downregulation of the IL-10 anti-inflammatory
cytokine (Fig. 4c) and found similar inflammatory cell infiltrates,
in liver and adipose tissue, for both Trypanosoma- and
Plasmodium-infected mice (Fig. 4d).
Importantly, in the same NIH 3T3 fibroblast study, although
inflammation led to downregulation of clock genes, the circadian
period of oscillations was unchanged17. We repeated the
running-wheel activity recordings with mice infected with
P. chabaudi. Similar to what we observed with Trypanosoma-
infected mice (Fig. 1c–g), malaria infection induced a sickness-
like behavior, after the first peak of parasitemia, with mice
running less than controls (Fig. 5a, c). However, unlike
trypanosome
infection,
malaria-infected
mice
did
not
increase their activity during daytime (Fig. 5c), suggesting that
these mice have normal circadian rhythms. To further confirm
this, we recorded malaria-infected mice in DD. Once again
there was a decrease in activity, but the period of the
circadian clock remained the same: both control and infected
mice showed a running-wheel activity period of 23.69 h ± 0.06 s.
d.
(Fig.
5b,
d).
Similarly,
the
molecular
clock
remained
normal upon malaria infection. None of the tested organs of
P. chabaudi-infected PER2::LUC mice showed significantly
different period than the control mice (Fig. 5e), indicating that,
unlike T. brucei, P. chabaudi infection does not cause detectable
period changes.
T. brucei is sufficient to shorten period of fibroblasts. Together
our data reveal two different effects of T. brucei infection: down-
regulation of clock gene expression (common to other infections,
inflammation-driven) and period shortening (probably trypano-
some specific). To exclude the contribution of inflammation
further, we co-cultured healthy explants of SCN, lung, gonadal
adipose tissue, and epididymis of PER2::LUC mice with 105 T.
brucei parasites. Luminescence was recorded for five days and
circadian parameters estimated as above. In the presence of
parasites, PER2 expression period tended to be shorter, being
significantly shorter in the adipose tissue explant (Fig. 6a). This
experiment suggests that the period shortening is possibly due to
a secreted molecule from the parasite, since the explant is sepa-
rated from the parasite culture by a 0.4-μm pore membrane. The
absence of a significant difference in PER2 expression period in
the SCN, epididymis, and lung may be due to a lower ratio of
parasites to host cells, since these tissues are composed of a higher
number of cells per milligram. Unfortunately, there are technical
limitations in order to culture higher numbers of parasites
because in high density cultures (1–3 × 106/mL), T. brucei dif-
ferentiate into non-replicative stumpy forms and die soon after29.
Unlike what is observed in normal culture conditions where
starting a culture at 5 × 104/mL leads to parasite death on day 4,
parasites were alive until day 5 in our recording conditions, with
the population being ~80% composed by stumpy forms on this
day (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b). Since it was not possible to use
higher numbers of viable parasites, we took an alternative
approach. We co-cultured low density T. brucei cultures with
primary and immortalized fibroblasts of mouse PER2::LUC and
observed that, in the presence of T. brucei, PER2 circadian
period in both fibroblast types was 30 min shorter (Fig. 6b, c
and
Supplementary
Fig.
5c).
Taken
together,
these
data
demonstrate that an inflammatory response via the immune
system is not responsible for the shortening of clock gene period
and that parasite presence is sufficient to induce these period
changes.
Given the above in vitro results (parasite sufficiency for period
modifications) and that all life cycle stages in T. brucei are
extracellular, we investigated the existence of a parasite structural
protein/lipid or secreted factor(s) that could induce changes in
the period of the molecular clock in mammalian cells. We
cultured fibroblasts with parasite lysates, with the very abundant
and cleaved trypanosome variant surface glycoprotein (sVSG)
30,31 or conditioned media. Parasite lysates did not shorten the
period of the fibroblasts’ clock (Supplementary Fig. 5d), which is
not surprising since we observed a shortening of the period even
in the presence of a separating membrane (Fig. 6a). Adding sVSG
to the media shortened the period of the lung circadian clock, but
it did not shorten the period of the adipose tissue or fibroblasts
(Supplementary Fig. 5e–g). Finally, although variability in the

 period of fibroblasts increased when cultured with T. brucei-
conditioned media, the period length remained the same
(Supplementary Fig. 5h), suggesting that this molecule may be
labile. Overall our data strongly suggest that the presence of T.
brucei parasites, and not a systemic immune response, is
responsible for the changes in period of the circadian clock of
the host.
Discussion
As the name implies, sleeping sickness is considered a sleep
disorder. However, the timing of sleep7,32, activity19, and endo-
crine secretion8 observed in patients suggests a circadian aspect to
this disease. Here, we validate a mouse model that recapitulates
these observations made in patients and provides evidence that
sleeping sickness is a circadian disorder.

 When the circadian behavior of infected mice was recorded in
the dark, we detected a short circadian period soon after infection
before parasites accumulate in large numbers in the brain. Run-
ning behavior is controlled by the master clock in the SCN16;
however, these observations suggest that the presence of high
numbers of T. brucei in the brain is not necessary for the period
shortening of the master clock. Instead, it raises the possibility
that a peripheral molecule(s), metabolite or hormone, from the
host or directly produced by the parasite, is released from the
periphery and feeds back to the master clock. This observation is
consistent with a study in Uganda, in which 57% of early blood-
stage (when parasites have not yet reached the central nervous
system) T. brucei rhodesiense-infected patients already experi-
enced somnolence33. Similar observations were made in T. brucei
gambiense6,34.
Despite the 2-h period shortening observed in the periphery,
ex vivo analysis of PER2::LUC expression from SCN of T. brucei-
infected mice showed no differences relative to controls on days 6
and 20 post-infection. This suggests that when isolated from the
periphery in culture, the SCN clock in the brain appears unaf-
fected. On the other hand, 60 days post-infection, the period of
PER2::LUC expression in the SCN was shorter than in controls.

 This could be due to a higher parasite infiltration in the brain
parenchyma on day 60 and/or to the fact that the master clock in
the SCN has a more robust molecular clock with higher intrinsic
resistance to perturbations22,35–37. This is likely the reason why
the circadian period in the SCN is only 30 min shorter whereas in
the highly parasite-infiltrated adipose tissue the period is shor-
tened by 2 h. Curiously, in a previous study using a rat model for
sleeping sickness, researchers found a ~30-min period shortening
in the pituitary gland using a Per1-luc reporter, but not in the
SCN38. That study did not find behavioral period changes pos-
sibly because the rat model was not studied during long-term
infection. Here, interestingly, the period change observed in the
mouse SCN ex vivo is similar to the period shortening of mice’s
running-wheel activity.
Substantial evidence has suggested that inflammation and, in
particular, cytokines cause fever, fatigue, and sleep disturbances,
which are collectively referred to as sickness behavior syn-
drome39. By injecting TNF, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, the
locomotor activity of mice is dramatically decreased17. TNF and
IL-1β are also both somnogenic, increasing nonrapid eye-
movement (NREM) sleep39,40. TNF leads to the suppression of
the expression of clock downstream genes Dbp, Tef, and Hlf and
of the Period genes Per1, Per2, and Per317. So, in general, cyto-
kines41–43 and even bacterial infection44 have been shown to

 downregulate circadian clock expression, which may be a com-
mon factor to all infections and responsible for the sickness
behavior. Although this may explain why Trypanosoma-infected
mice run less than healthy control mice, and why both Trypa-
nosoma- and Plasmodium-infected mice show lower transcript
levels of clock genes, it cannot explain the differences in the
timing and period of clock gene expression. Although TNF
injection decreases activity, it does not alter mice circadian
rest–activity cycles17. Similarly, cytokines damped the oscillations
of clock gene expression but always kept the same period17. The
fact that the period of PER2::LUC Trypanosoma-infected mice
did not change on day 6, when there are already very high
numbers of circulating inflammatory cells18,45, and that despite
inflammation46,
organs
of
Plasmodium-infected

also
maintained their period, suggests that period shortening induced
during T. brucei infection is not due to inflammation. Further-
more, in vitro host cells and explants co-cultured with T. brucei
showed shorter period. Although many studies show that the
outcome of an infection depends on the time of day at which the
infection is initiated44,47,48, T. brucei appears be the first infection
capable of shortening the period of the host circadian clock.
Here, we show that sleeping sickness infection shortens circa-
dian period and phase advances the host circadian rhythm at the
behavior, cellular, and molecular levels. These circadian changes
are likely the cause of sleep alterations that are typical of this
disease. Further studies are required to identify the systemic
signal (secreted by the parasite, or a molecule produced by the
host in response to this infection) that could be responsible for
such changes in the period of the circadian clock.
Methods
Ethics statement. All animal care and experimental procedures were performed in
accordance with (i) University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW)
IACUC guidelines, approved by the Ethical Review Committee at the University of
Southwestern Medical Center and performed under the IACUC-2012-0021 pro-
tocol and (ii) European Union (EU) Directive 2010/63/EU, approved by the
Animal Ethics Committee of Instituto de Medicina Molecular (IMM) (AEC-2011-
006-LF-TBrucei-IMM), following FELASA guidelines concerning laboratory ani-
mal welfare.
Parasites and culture conditions. T. brucei AnTat 1.1e, a pleomorphic clone,
derived from an EATRO1125 strain was originally isolated from the blood of
Tragelaphus scriptus in Uganda49. In all experiments, we used AnTat 1.1e 90-13, a
transgenic cell-line encoding the tetracycline repressor and T7 RNA polymerase50.
For all mice infections, the parasite cryostabilates used were obtained from a
previous 5-day infection. Prior to co-culture experiments, bloodstream forms were
grown routinely in HMI-11 medium at 37 °C in 5% CO251, after which they were
transferred to TbM50 medium, described in the circadian bioluminescence section.
Parasite numbers were calculated using a Hemocytometer.
Trypanosoma brucei mouse infection. The infections of wild-type male C57BL/6J
mice, 6–10-week old (UT Southwestern Medical Center Mouse Breeding Core
Facility or Charles River Laboratories, France) described in this manuscript, were
performed by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 2000 T. brucei AnTat 1.1e parasites
between ZT9-12 (3-hour interval before lights are off). Prior to infection, T. brucei
cryostabilates were thawed and parasite viability and numbers were assessed by
mobility under a microscope. For circadian luminescence experiments, B6.129S6-
Per2tm1Jt/J (JAX stock number 006852), which we refer to as PER2::LUC mice in
the text, were group housed and maintained in a Specific-Pathogen-Free barrier
facility. The facility has standard laboratory conditions: 21–22 °C ambient tem-
perature and a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle (LD12:12). For behavioral and telemetry
experiments mice were individually housed. Chow and water were available ad
libitum.
Anemia assessment. Every Monday and Thursday, a sub-mandibular blood
sample was withdrawn between 10:00 and 11:00 AM to measure the hematocrit.
Approximately 50 μL of blood was collected into a hematocrit-measuring tube
(Hirschmann Laborgerate, Na-heparin 375 IU/capillary). The tube was then cen-
trifuged for 5 min at 12,000 revolutions per minute (rpm) and the hematocrit was
measured using a manual reading scale plate.
Circadian behavioral experiments. Mice were placed in individual running wheel
cages and their activity recorded continuously using the ClockLab data collection
system (Actimetrics, Wilmette, IL)21. After the first week on a LD (LD12:12) cycle,
mice were housed in DD for 10 days. Mice were then infected at ZT9–12 with T.
brucei either in light when mice were placed back on LD cycles (28 mice) or in the
dark when maintained in DD (41 mice) for the remaining of the experiment. On
day 21 post-infection, at ZT10–11 (Zeitgeber time, ZT), suramin (20 mg/kg, in 100
μL) was administered i.p. to 14 infected mice in LD cycle and 27 mice in DD, for
the long-term infection protocol. For a more graphical explanation of the infection

 protocol, please see Fig. 1a–c, e. Animals were checked for health and food status
daily with water bottles and bedding being changed every three weeks. Infrared
goggles were used during periods of DD. Total daily counts were calculated by
averaging the number of wheel revolutions during a 24-h day across the infection,
from injection until the end of the experiment. The free-running period in DD was
calculated from continuous 10-day periods by using χ2 periodogram analysis
(Clocklab software, Actimetrics, Wilmette, IL).
For the experiment with consecutive LD to DD and back to LD transitions
(Fig. 2e), the same initial LD and DD protocol as above was used. On day 60 post-
infection, animals were housed in DD for 15 days (DD-1), followed by seven days
of LD (LD-1) and new 18 days dark period (DD-2). Phase angles and circular
variances of circular plots (Rayleigh plots) were computed using Oriana (Kovach
Computing Services, Wales, UK). Multiple t-test comparisons (adjusted for
multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure for false discovery
rate) were used to compare control and infected mice phases across the different
dark periods using Graphpad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., USA). Behavior was
recorded from 6 controls and 14 infected animals.
Core body temperature measurement. Twelve mice were surgically implanted
with temperature telemeters (telemetry system with a G2 E-Mitter, Mini Mitter
Respironics, Bend, OR) inside the peritoneal cavity. Animals were individually
housed (without running wheels) and monitored for three weeks during recovery
from the surgery. For the animal recordings, cages were placed on top of ER-4000
receivers (Mini Mitter Respironics, Bend, OR) for real-time measurement of body
temperature and general cage activity. Baseline recordings correspond to four days
in LD12:12 cycles and 10 days in DD, after which seven mice were infected and five
were injected with HMI-11 medium vehicle only. For the remaining period of the
experiment, the light schedule was LD12:12 cycles. On day 21 post-infection, all
animals were injected i.p. with suramin (20 mg/kg) in ~100 μL.
The amplitude of the circadian rhythm was analyzed using the fast Fourier
transform (FFT), which estimates the relative power of approximately 24 h period
rhythm in comparison with all other periodicities in the time series (spectral
analysis, FFT power spectrum, Blackman-Harris windowing) as described
previously52 using ClockLab software (Actimetrics, Wilmette, IL).
CleverSys behavioral assay. Six mice were injected i.p. with either HMI-11
trypanosome medium (vehicle) or 2000 T. brucei parasites; 21 days post-infection,
animals were injected with suramin (20 mg/kg) in ~100 μL. On days 20, 65, 85, and
95 post-infection, animals were individually housed and their movement recorded
for 36 h in LD12:12 using CleverSys software. D1 represents the first 12 h in the
dark, L1 the first 12 h in light, and D2 the second night (dark). Data were auto
scored by CleverSys and sleep-like behavior manually curated for behavior bouts
lasting >300 s. Videos and scoring were visually validated. Statistical analyses were
carried out using Graphpad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., USA) and all data are
represented as mean ± s.e.m. Data distribution was first tested for normality (using
the Shapiro test) and data not violating normality were analyzed using two-way
mixed design ANOVA test, followed by the Bonferroni post-hoc test (multiple
comparisons test). Data that did not conform to normality were analyzed using the
Friedman test, followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test.
Real-Time qPCR of T. brucei-infected mice. Animals were housed individually
and activity was monitored using a running wheel. Thirty-six animals were either
infected or injected with medium and housed in DD. At 20 days post-infection, the
locomotor activity of every animal was recorded and analyzed using ClockLab
software (Actimetrics, Wilmette, IL) to determine the circadian phase, as pre-
viously described21. Three animals per phase cluster (6 time points) were eutha-
nized by cervical dislocation, their organs collected, and snap frozen. RNA isolation
and real-time PCR were performed as described previously53,54. In summary, RNA
was extracted using TRIzol™ Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and reverse
transcription was carried out using TaqMan™ Reverse Transcription Reagents
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) with random hexamers. Transcript levels were measured
in an Applied Biosystems® 7500 Real-Time PCR Systems and normalized to
Gapdh. Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 1.
Real-Time qPCR of P. chabaudi-infected mice. Thirty-six wild-type male C57BL/
6J male mice, 6–10-week old (Charles River Laboratories, France), were either
infected by i.p. injection of 1 × 105 P. chabaudi-infected red blood cells (iRBC) in
200 μL PBS or injected with PBS and used as controls. Parasitemia was assessed
daily. On the second peak of parasitemia (chronic infection), animals were housed
in DD for 48 h. On day 16 post-infection, three animals per condition in each of 6
time points (every 4 h) were euthanized by cervical dislocation, their organs col-
lected, and snap frozen. RNA was extracted and gene expression quantified by real-
time PCR53, as described in the previous section.
Histological analysis. Animals were sacrificed by CO2 narcosis, necropsy was
performed, and organs collected and immediately fixed in formalin. The head was
decalcified for 3 h using RDO solution. All organs were paraffin-embedded, sec-
tioned at 3 μm, and stained with hematoxilin and eosin (H&E), for routine his-
topathological analysis. For immunohistochemistry, 3-μm sections were stained for
abundant variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) using a non-purified rabbit serum
anti-T. brucei VSG13 antigen (cross-reactive with most VSGs via the C-terminal
domain)4. Liver and gonadal adipose tissue of Trypanosome- and Plasmodium-
infected mice were analyzed for the distribution of inflammatory cell infiltrates, as
well as their severity and cell type, and compared with uninfected controls (n = 5).
Circadian bioluminescence experiments. Trypanosoma-infected and control
PER2::LUC (B6.129S6-Per2tm1Jt/J) mice27 were euthanized by cervical dislocation
between ZT10 and ZT12 on days 6, 20, and 60 post-infection. Two animals were
always processed in parallel; one injected with parasites and another with vehicle
only. SCN tissues were isolated from 300-μm coronal brain sections, and pituitary,
heart, lung, liver, adrenal, adipose tissue, and epididymis were dissected and kept in
chilled Hanks’ buffered salt solution (Invitrogen) until cultured. All dissected tis-
sues were cultured on Millicell culture membranes (PICMORG50, Millipore) and
were placed in 35-mm tissue culture dishes containing 1.2 mL TbM50 medium,
composed of 50% (v/v) DMEM media (Mediatech) supplemented with 2 mM L-
Glutamine, 25 units/mL penicillin, 25 μg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 50%
(v/v) HMI-11 Trypanosome media and 0.1 mM luciferin potassium salt (L-8240,
Biosynth AG). Sealed dishes were placed in a LumiCycle luminometer machine
(Actimetrics, Wilmette, IL) and bioluminescence was recorded continuously. Cir-
cadian parameters were calculated in the LumiCycle analysis software. Raw data
was detrended by subtraction of background bioluminescence based on a running
average curve fit to the midline of daily bioluminescence oscillations for all cul-
tures. Circadian parameters of the baseline-subtracted data were determined by a
best-fit sine wave analysis within the LumiCycle Analysis software package, with
period being defined by how long it takes a full cycle to be completed, phase as the
time of the day with maximum PER2 expression in the first cycle, and damping as
the damping rate (gradual decrease of amplitude across the days) of such oscilla-
tions55. Plasmodium-infected PER2::LUC mice were euthanized on day 16 post-
infection and organs were processed similarly.
Primary ear fibroblasts were isolated from the ear of PER2::LUC mice using 5
mg/mL collagenase I and 0.05% trypsin, followed by a 30-min incubation at 37 °C.
For the luminescence assay, cells were plated to confluency in 35 mm dishes with
TbM50 medium. Cells were synchronized with a 2-mL TbM50 medium change
and half of the fibroblast cultures were incubated with 5 × 104/mL T. brucei
parasites and placed in LumiCycle luminometer with continuous bioluminescence
recording for five days. Immortalized PER2::LUC sv/sv fibroblasts36 were cultured
similarly but in 24-well plates. For the healthy PER2::LUC explants co-cultured
with parasites, a similar number of parasites were added to the TbM50 recording
media.
In the conditioned media experiments, parasites and, in parallel, PER2::LUC sv/
sv fibroblasts were grown for three days in the co-culture recording conditions
(TbM50 medium, air tight). Pooled parasite cultures were centrifuged at 1800 rpm
for 10 min at room temperature, and the supernatant was used as parasite-
conditioned media. Supernatant from multiple fibroblast cultures was also pooled
and used as fibroblast-conditioned media. Both parasite- and fibroblast-
conditioned media were used in 60–40% of fresh TbM50 medium, to ensure
synchronization of the receiving fibroblast cultures.
In lysate experiments, parasites were grown in HMI-11 below 1 × 106/mL
density and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Parasite pellets were lysed
for 5 min at 37 °C in a hypotonic 10 mM phosphate lysis buffer solution (pH 8.0
containing 0.1 mM TLCK (1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone; Nα-
Tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride), 1 μg/mL leupeptin, and 1 μg/
mL aprotinin protease inhibitors), 33 μL of lysis buffer for every 8 million parasites.
Fibroblasts were cultured as described above and synchronized with 100 nM
Dexamethasone for 2 h prior to adding the lysates (8 million or 1.6 million) or lysis
buffer control for luminescence recording.
Parasite cell-cycle stage and bloodstream form assessment. Cultures with a
starting inoculum of 5 × 104/mL T. brucei parasites, in either normal culture
conditions (HMI11 medium) or in co-culture recording conditions (TbM50
medium), were monitored for 5 days and viability was recorded. Similar cultures
were started using the parasite GFP::PAD1utr reporter cell line, in which a PAD1 3′
UTR sequence is downstream of the coding sequence for Green Fluorescence
Protein (GFP), which allows for maximum expression of this protein in stumpy
parasite forms. Assessment of bloodstream forms was performed by measuring
GFP expression and scoring cell-cycle stage after parasite fixation by slowly adding
ethanol to the culture sample to a final concentration of 70%. Fixed trypanosomes
were pelleted and DNA was stained using a solution of 0.5 mL PBS/2 mM EDTA
containing 10 μg RNAse A and 1 mg propidium iodide (red fluorescence) and
incubating samples for 30 min at 37 °C. The percentage of dividing cells was
measured in five independent cultures for each of the five days, from a minimum of
30,000 events. The intensity of green and red fluorescence was measured using a
FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and data were analyzed using
FlowJo.
Purification of soluble variant surface glycoprotein. For the purification of
sVSG from T. brucei, ~5 × 109 trypanosomes were grown in culture, harvested, and
lysed with 3 mL, at 37 °C, pre-warmed hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM sodium

1 µg/mL aprotinin, Sigma-Aldrich). The supernatant was passed through a column
of DE5256 pre-equilibrated in 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0). Sample was then
concentrated with a Amicon-15 spin concentrator (Millipore); 100 μg of sVSG was
used as equivalent of 108 trypanosomes.
