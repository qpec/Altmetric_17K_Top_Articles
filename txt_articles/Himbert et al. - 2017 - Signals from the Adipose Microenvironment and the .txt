Abstract
Obesity and its associated metabolic dysregulation are
established risk factors for many cancers. However, the bio-
logic mechanisms underlying this relationship remain incom-
pletely understood. Given the rising rates of both obesity and
cancer worldwide, and the challenges for many people to lose
excess adipose tissue, a systematic approach to identify poten-
tial molecular and metabolic targets is needed to develop
effective mechanism-based strategies for the prevention and
control of obesity-driven cancer. Epidemiologic, clinical, and
preclinical data suggest that within the growth-promoting,
proinflammatory microenvironment accompanying obesity,
crosstalk between adipose tissue (comprised of adipocytes,
macrophages and other cells) and cancer-prone cells may
occur via obesity-associated hormones, cytokines, and other
mediators that have been linked to increased cancer risk
and/or progression. We report here a systematic review on
the direct "crosstalk" between adipose tissue and carcinomas
in humans. We identified 4,641 articles with n ¼ 20 human
clinical studies, which are summarized as: (i) breast (n ¼ 7);
(ii) colorectal (n ¼ 4); (iii) esophageal (n ¼ 2); (iv) esoph-
ageal/colorectal (n ¼ 1); (v) endometrial (n ¼ 1); (vi) prostate
(n ¼ 4); and (vii) ear-nose-throat (ENT) cancer (n ¼ 1).
Findings from these clinical studies reinforce preclinical data
and suggest organ-dependent crosstalk between adipose tissue
and carcinomas via VEGF, IL6, TNFa, and other mechanisms.
Moreover, visceral white adipose tissue plays a more central
role, as it is more bioenergetically active and is associated
with a more procancer secretome than subcutaneous adipose
tissue. Efforts to eavesdrop and ultimately interfere with this
cancer-enhancing crosstalk may lead to new targets and strat-
egies for decreasing the burden of obesity-related cancers.

Introduction
Obesity is a major global health challenge and is expected to
further increase substantially over the next several decades (1). In
the United States, 38% of adults are obese, defined as having a
body mass index (BMI) >30 kg/m2, and nearly 8% are extremely
obese, with a BMI > 40 kg/m2 (2). A recent summary by the
International Agency for Research on Cancer reinforced obesity as
a risk factor of many cancer types, including colorectal, postmeno-
pausal breast, liver, endometrial, esophageal, kidney (renal cell),
gastric, gall bladder, pancreatic, ovarian, thyroid, and multiple
myeloma (3).
With cross-sectional studies investigating tumors in over-
weight or obese cancer patients, new knowledge can be gained
on adipose-associated factors that drive tumor development
and growth. The interactions between an evolving tumor and its
microenvironment are known to involve a complex interplay
among multiple cells, local and systemic secreted mediators,
and other components (4, 5). In particular, emerging evidence
suggests that noncancer cell types in the tumor microenviron-
ment, such as adipocytes and macrophages, interact to enhance
inflammation, reprogram cancer cell metabolism, and affect
processes involved in invasion, metastasis, and immune clear-
ance, all of which can support tumor progression and impact
patient outcome (6).
Adipose tissue classification
Adipose tissue can be classified into three different types: white
(WAT), brown (BAT), and beige adipose tissue, whose presence
differs with development, species, and anatomic location (7).
Although BAT and beige adipose tissue have been associated with
thermoregulation, WAT is considered the key site for energy
storage in the form of triacylglycerides (7). WAT can be further
divided into distinct body compartments, which have differential
impact on disease risk (8). Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and
subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) are characterized by differ-
ences in cellular structure, molecular composition, and secre-
tome, each of which may be altered by the degree of adiposity
itself (8). VAT is generally considered to be bioenergetically
more active and responsive to substrates of the electron transport
chain than SAT due to a higher concentration of mitochondria.
However, BAT has even higher mitochondrial density than
VAT, so the differences in metabolic activity between VAT and
SAT can be influenced by their brown or beige adipocyte content.
VAT adipocytes are also more lipolytically active than SAT

 adipocytes and, thus, contribute more to plasma-free fatty acid
levels, particularly in obese individuals. In addition, although
pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators and immune cells (e.g.,
Tregs, TH2, eosinophils, ILC2s) maintain immune balance in the
lean (healthy) state of adipose tissue (6), increased WAT mass
accelerates chronic inflammation through at least three mechan-
isms: altered generation of secreted inflammatory factors,
increased tissue inflammation (immune cell infiltration and
formation of crown-like structures by macrophages surrounding
dead or dying adipocytes), and adipose tissue remodeling (9).
Consequently, the evidence has shown a stronger correlation
between WAT and cancer risk compared with BAT and beige
adipose tissue (10). Visceral fat area has also been found to be
a predictive factor of poor survival and treatment outcomes for
different cancer types, such as colon, esophageal, and renal
cancers (11–14).
Adipose tissue–induced inflammation
Inflammation, a hallmark of cancer (4), has been linked to
obesity and cancer in both epidemiologic and preclinical
research (15). Evidence from preclinical in vitro and in vivo
studies is emerging that obesity-associated adipose-derived
factors, including the cytokines IL6, IL8, monocyte chemotactic
protein 1 (MCP-1), and TNFa, as well as infiltrating inflam-
mation-inducing cells (e.g., macrophages), can influence cel-
lular metabolism and promote cancer (see Fig. 1; refs. 16–22).
This expanded, inflamed adipose tissue appears to increase
cancer risk more prominently than obesity itself (6) and may
stimulate the hallmark events involved in the development and
progression of cancer (23), including cellular transformation,
cell survival and proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and
metastasis (see Fig. 1; ref. 24).
O'Flanagan and colleagues have demonstrated that obesity
enhances the development and metastatic spread of orthotopi-
cally transplanted metM-Wntlung cells, a triple-negative breast
cancer cell line that metastasizes to the lung (25). Pascual and
colleagues also showed that diet-induced obesity increases the
metastatic potential of several types of cancer cells, including oral
squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, luminal breast cancer,
bladder cancer, and small-cell lung carcinoma, in a CD36-depen-
dent manner (26). Muller's group found a metabolic symbiosis
between tumor-associated adipocytes and cancer cells involving
transfer of triglyceride to the cancer cells, resulting in increased
availability of free fatty acids for b-oxidation and enhanced
metastatic potential (27). They also established that components
of the adipocyte secretome, particularly IL6, are able to stimulate
the invasive capacity of breast cancer cells, independent of any
effect on proliferation (28, 29).
IL6 regulates the inflammatory process by inducing the pro-
duction of acute-phase proteins and other inflammatory mole-
cules
[e.g.,
C-reactive
protein
(CRP),
prostaglandins,
and
fibrinogen], the recruitment of CD3þ T lymphocytes, and the
proliferation of B lymphocytes. Recent publications have dem-
onstrated crosstalk between adipose tissue and breast as well as
colon cancer cells through IL6 (16–19, 30). For example, Walter
and colleagues have reported that IL6 is secreted by adipose
stromal cells (ASC) and promotes migration and invasion in
breast cancer cells (30). A variety of signaling pathways have
been investigated to elucidate how IL6 induces cell proliferation.
In colorectal cancer cell lines, for example, IL6 triggers the phos-
phorylation of ERK, p38 (MAPK), MEK1/2, JAK2, and STAT3
signaling molecules that control cell metabolism and prolifera-
tion (18). Obesity-associated systemic IL6 also promotes ASC
aromatase expression via direct effects and stimulation of breast
cancer cell cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) expression and prostaglan-
din E2 (PGE2) production (31). The subsequent elevation in
estradiol levels promotes estrogen receptor–positive (ERþ) breast
cancer cell growth (17).

 IL8 shows chemotactic attributes and is particularly involv-
ed in the recruitment of leukocytes. Adipocytes in cancer
stroma upregulate the expression of IL8, which exerts its effects
via the PI3K, JAK/STAT3, ERK, and MAPK signaling path-
ways, resulting in cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and
invasion (20).
MCP-1, also known as chemokine (CC motif) ligand (CCL2),
plays a key role in the recruitment and accumulation of proin-
flammatory macrophages in both adipose and tumor tissues
(16). Studies demonstrated elevated adipose tissue MCP-1 in
obese mice compared with lean controls, indicating MCP-1 is
an important factor for enhanced macrophage recruitment into
obesity-associated adipose tissue (32). Consistent with this
observation, obesity-induced MCP-1 (and IL1b) expression in
mammary fat depots leads to increased macrophage recruit-
ment (16).
TNFa is a cytokine mainly secreted by macrophages, includ-
ing those in the adipose tissue. In breast cancer cells lines, TNFa
can have either growth-promoting or inhibiting properties
depending on cell type (19). Reports also suggest that TNFa
contributes to cancer cell proliferation via MAPK and PI3K/AKT
signaling pathways (19).
Tumor-infiltrating ASCs
In addition to the protumor para- or endocrine effects of
inflammatory factors from dysfunctional adipose tissue, several
studies have shown that ASCs from the adipose actually infiltrate
cancer lesions and contribute to a tumor-promoting microenvi-
ronment via paracrine and contact-dependent effects. Further-
more, the recruitment of ASCs to tumors is enhanced by obesity.
Kolonin and colleagues have published several pioneering studies
in this area, first demonstrating that GFP-labeled ASCs are recruited
to tumors, but not other organs (33). They then found that obesity
in mice is associated with increased tumor-infiltrating ASCs that
are traceable to an adipose tissue origin and that these ASCs
promote tumor growth in multiple cancer models by facilitating
tumor vascularization (11, 12). ASCs migrate to tumors in
response to tumor production of CXCL1 and CXCL8 (34). The
application of these preclinical findings to human disease was
evidenced by data indicating that obese prostate cancer patients
have increased tumor CXCL1 expression, circulating ASCs, and
tumor-infiltrating ASCs (34) and has been further demonstrated
by studies indicating an increase in circulating mesenchymal
stromal cells (which include ASCs) in obese disease-free donors
(35) and colorectal cancer patients (36) as well as an increase in
circulating ASCs in obese breast cancer survivors (37).
Others have similarly found that ASCs play a key role in cancer
progression via additional mechanisms, including the promotion
of metastasis and alterations in extracellular matrix mechanics
(38, 39). In addition, obesity has been shown to promote a
profibrotic ASC phenotype, leading to a more fibrillar and stiffer
extracellular matrix that enhances mammary tumor growth and
the tumorigenic potential of premalignant human breast epithe-
lial cells (40). These mechanisms may act in parallel to ASC's
effects on tumor vascularization, suggesting that the obesity-
associated elevation in tumor ASCs may play a significant role
in obesity-induced tumor progression via multiple mechanisms.
Adipokines and hormones
Leptin is a peptide hormone mainly produced within adi-
pose tissue. Beside its neuroendocrine function controlling
food intake, leptin can impact a wide range of biological
activities, including angiogenesis, bone formation, and mod-
ulation of immune responses (41, 42). The intensity of its
production and secretion by adipocytes depends on the body
energy status and is highly increased in obese individuals; the
resulting leptin resistance causes hyperphagia and increases
adipose tissue volume (43).
Obesity-associated hyperleptinemia also promotes chronic
low-grade inflammation by stimulating the production of IL1,
IL6, IL12, and TNFa (43, 44). In a murine model of preneo-
plastic (ApcMin/þ; IMCE) colon epithelial cells, leptin treatment
induced the production of IL6 (18). Consequently, leptin
seems to be an important initiating mediator in the proin-
flammatory cascade in adipose tissue (45). Multiple studies
have reported that leptin-induced cell signaling cascades are
associated with an enhanced risk for different types of cancer,
such as colorectal, hepatocellular, renal, breast, ovarian, endo-
metrial, and prostate (46).
Adiponectin, another major adipokine, antagonizes the onco-
genic actions of leptin in several tissues. Also secreted by adipo-
cytes, but at reduced levels in the obese versus nonobese state,
adiponectin regulates the effects of insulin on adipocytes and
attenuates inflammation (6, 47). There is in vitro evidence of a
protective effect of adiponectin on the development of cancer by
inhibiting proliferation and metastasis (48–52). Particularly in
breast cancer cells, it has been shown that adiponectin signaling
results in antiproliferative responses (48–50). The peptide hor-
mone stimulates AMPK and PPARa signaling and inhibits MAP
kinase pathways via two types of receptors (AdipoR1 and R2;
refs. 49, 52).
Increased levels of the steroid hormone estradiol have been
associated with breast and gynecologic cancers, such as cervical,
endometrial, and ovarian cancer. The conversion of androgen to
estradiol by aromatase (a key step in estradiol synthesis) in
adipose tissue is the major source of circulating estradiol in
postmenopausal women (53). Estradiol's effects are mediated
by ER's transcription factor activity as well as its stimulation of
PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways (54). Several in vitro
studies have demonstrated that obesity-associated factors (e.g.,
leptin, IL6, TNFa) increase the expression and activation of
aromatase and estrogen receptors in ASCs and cancer cells (e.g.,
breast and endometrial; refs. 55–60).
IGF-1 is a growth factor with similar molecular structure and
signaling pathways to insulin and is mutagenic in many cancer
cell lines (21, 61). For example, crosstalk between leptin and
IGF-1 has been reported to induce invasion and migration of
breast cancer cells (21). Findings from fatless A-Zip/F1 trans-
genic mice, which lack WAT and have alipotrophic diabetes,
suggest that leptin and adiponectin may be less critical to
tumorigenesis when insulin and/or IGF-1 are elevated. Tumor
growth in these mice following topical application of a carcin-
ogen or crossbreeding with a transgenic model of breast cancer
was enhanced despite the total lack of adipose tissue and
associated adipokines (62).
The current report systematically reviews the evidence regard-
ing crosstalk between the adipose tissue (as an entity, comprised
of adipocytes, macrophages, and other cells) and carcinomas. We
characterize the dimensions of this crosstalk in the context of
mechanisms highlighted above. In contrast to prior reviews, we
describe the direct interactions that occur between tumor cells
and adipose tissue compartments in multiple cancer types, where

 adipose tissue can be adjacent to the tumor or part of the
peritumoral microenvironment. Our focus on cross-sectional
studies investigating the adipose–tumor crosstalk provides
insight into direct adipose-stroma–associated factors that drive
tumor development and growth.
Materials and Methods
We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed/Med-
line covering publications from January 1946 to March 2017 with
the goal to identify literature characterizing crosstalk between
adipose tissue and carcinomas.
Two researchers (C. Himbert and M. Delphan) independently
performed two searches with the following search terms:
(i) (adipose OR fat OR obese) AND (tissue OR cell) AND (cancer
OR tumor) AND (crosstalk OR microenvironment OR paracrine
OR milieu OR interaction); and (ii) adipose tissue in cancer
patients. The queries resulted in 4,641 article publications.
At the identification stage, abstracts were read, and the articles
were selected according to the following inclusion criteria: English
language, prospective human clinical studies, adults (>18 years),
and solid tumor types (in addition to "cancer" overall, we
searched specifically for, e.g., breast, gastrointestinal, reproduc-
tive, melanoma, and renal cancer).
At the screening stage, articles were screened on the basis of
the following criteria: crosstalk (e.g., paracrine influence, adi-
pocytes as cancer microenvironment) between adipose tissue
and carcinoma in cancer patients. Studies investigating solely
the systematic effects of secreted products of either adipose
tissue or carcinoma (e.g., inflammation markers, adipokines,
hormones measured in plasma or serum) were not included.
Because the diverse publications on this topic could not be
identified with simple search terms, we used the above
described broad search strategy. The primary reasons for exclu-
sion were (i) no cancer patients, (ii) animal study, (iii) inter-
vention study, and (iv) review.
Finally, n ¼ 20 primary research publications of human
clinical studies were found to be directly relevant as describing
adipose
tissue/tumor
interactions
and
are
summarized
in Table 1: (i) breast cancer (n ¼ 7); (ii) colorectal cancer
(n ¼ 4); (iii) esophageal cancer (n ¼ 2); (iv) esophageal and
colorectal cancer (n ¼ 1); (v) endometrial (n ¼ 1); (vi) prostate
cancer (n ¼ 4); and (vii) ear-nose-throat (ENT) cancer (n ¼ 1).
Disagreements relating to data extraction were discussed
between authors and resolved. The overall process is outlin-
ed in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA) flow diagram (Fig. 2;

Adipose tissue in cancer—human clinical studies
N ¼ 20 studies have been identified that were conducted in
patients with different cancer types (breast, colorectal, esophage-
al, endometrial, prostate, and ENT) to investigate the crosstalk
between patients' adipose tissue and carcinomas (see Table 1;
refs. 8, 64–75).
The majority of human studies have been conducted in
breast cancer patients (n ¼ 7; refs. 66, 68, 70, 75–78). Other
studies have been implemented in cancers of the gastrointes-
tinal tract [colorectal cancer (n ¼ 4; refs. 8, 64, 71, 73),
esophageal cancer (n ¼ 2; refs. 65, 79), combined (colorectal
and

cancer
[endometrial (n ¼ 1; ref. 72), prostate (n ¼ 4; refs. 69, 74,
81, 82)], or ENT tract [tongue (n ¼ 1; ref. 83)].
Breast cancer. The tumor stroma, consisting of immune cells,
fibroblasts, extracellular matrix, and other cells, may have
profound tumor-promoting effects and plays an important role
when investigating the tumor microenvironment. Of interest,
although the risk for breast cancer is increased for obese
postmenopausal women, premenopausal obese women have
a lower incidence of breast cancer (84). Adipocytes comprise
about 90% of the normal breast tissue and, thus, the question
of adipocytes contributing directly to tumor progression as
part of the tumor stroma has been addressed in several studies
(66, 68, 70, 75, 76). Breast cancer stroma can be classified into
adipose stroma cancer (>50% of cells are adipocytes), and
fibrous stroma cancer (100% of cells are fibroblasts) or a
combination of both stroma types (<100% of cells are fibro-
blasts, <50% are adipocytes; ref. 76).
The most recent study collected benign breast tissue of n ¼ 83
postmenopausal women who were recently diagnosed with inva-
sive breast cancer (75). Mullooly and colleagues focused on the
association between crown-like structures and steroid hormones
in breast adipose tissue (75). In about 36% of the tissue samples,
crown-like structures were detected, and the frequency was
increased in obese individuals (75). Women with a high ratio of
estrone:androstendione were more likely to exhibit crown-like
structures; individual hormone levels or tumor characteristics
were not associated (75).
Another study investigated the association between the den-
sities of tumor-associated macrophages with or without crown-
like structures with patient survival (78). Furthermore, the
authors assessed whether there are differences between the
racial/ethnicity groups (Caucasian, black, non-black Latinas).
Densities of tumor-associated macrophages in black breast
cancer patients were the highest (mean ¼ 142.21 cells/mm2)
compared with Caucasian (62.72 cells/mm2) and non-black
Latinas (110.16 cells/mm2; ref. 78). Caucasian patients pre-
sented with a significantly lower density of tumor-associated
macrophages than the other ethnicities (P < 0.0001; ref. 78).
Tumor-associated macrophages detected in the tissue of black
patients showed a higher proliferation activity of tumor-asso-
ciated macrophages, and survival rates for black patients were
lower than for other ethnicities (78).
In a large study, n ¼ 939 breast cancer cases were classified
depending on the adipose tissue and fibroblast content within
the tumor stroma into adipose stroma type and fibrous stroma
type (76). The differences between these two cancer types were
investigated regarding the breast cancer subtypes, molecular
tumor characteristics, and the patients' outcome (76). Cases
with cancer of "adipose stroma type" showed higher expression
of cancer-associated and fibroblast-related proteins [e.g., fibro-
blast activation protein a (FAPa), prolyl 4-hydroxylase] com-
pared with cases with "fibrous stroma type." For example,
FAPa, which is reported to be involved in extracellular matrix
modulation and tumor cell invasion, was higher expressed in
stroma (P < 0.001) and tumor (P < 0.001) cells in "adipose
stroma type" patients (76). Furthermore, among cases of "adi-
pose stroma type," high tumor expression of prolyl 4-hydroxy-
lase was associated with longer disease-free survival (P ¼ 0.03;

 ref. 76). However, stromal expression of prolyl 4-hydroxylase
was associated with shorter disease-free (P ¼ 0.005) and overall
(P < 0.001) survival (76). Taken together, the results show that
breast cancer of "adipose stroma type" presents a distinct
expression profile that may lead to an increase in cancer growth,
invasion, and metastasis compared with the "fibrous stroma
type."
Recently, Iyengar and colleagues focused on breast WAT-
induced inflammation, which was defined by the presence of
crown-like structures within WAT (66). Using biospecimens
from two cohorts [cohort 1, prospective (n ¼ 100), cohort 2,
retrospective (n ¼ 127)], they reported that 52 of 100 (52%)
and 52 of 127 (41%) patients had breast WAT inflammation,
respectively (66). Cohort 1 patients with WAT inflammation
experienced increased levels of insulin, glucose, leptin, CRP,
and IL6 and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and
adiponectin (P < 0.05). In cohort 2, WAT-induced inflamma-
tion correlated with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabe-
tes (P < 0.05). In both cohorts, WAT inflammation was asso-
ciated with reduced recurrence-free survival, suggesting that
WAT inflammation may, at least in part, explain the relation-
ship between metabolic syndrome and worse breast cancer
prognosis (66).
The same study presented results on the association between
breast WAT inflammation and menopausal status or BMI in
n ¼ 237 breast cancer patients (77). They reported a signi-
ficant association between breast tissue–associated crown-like
structures (CLS-B) or the crown-like structures' density (CLS-
B/cm2; indicating WAT inflammation) with menopausal status
(P ¼ 0.008 and P < 0.001) and BMI (both P < 0.001; ref. 77).
Furthermore, the average size of adipocytes was correlated with
crown-like structures in breast tissue (P < 0.001; ref. 77).
In a small study, Savolainen-Peltonen and colleagues exam-
ined the concentrations of estrone, estradiol, and estradiol fatty
acyl ester and the mRNA expression of estrogen-converting
enzymes in subcutaneous breast adipose tissue (70). Samples
were collected from postmenopausal women either with ERþ
breast cancer (n ¼ 14) or undergoing breast reduction mam-
moplasty (controls; n ¼ 14; ref. 70). The concentration of
estradiol in breast subcutaneous adipose tissue was reduced
in women with cancer compared with controls (P ¼ 0.002;
ref. 70). Expression of 17ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
type 12 was also lower in the adipose tissue of breast cancer
patients compared with controls (P ¼ 0.018; ref. 70). This
suggests that estradiol metabolism may be differentially regu-
lated in the adipose tissue of women with breast cancer.
Confirming their initial results of links between adiposity
and inflammation in a mouse model (85), Morris and collea-
gues showed in breast tissue of n ¼ 30 breast cancer patients
that the severity of breast inflammation, defined as the crow-
like structures of the breast index (CLS-B; number of breast
WAT slides with evidence of crown-like structures/number of
breast WAT slides examined), correlated with BMI (P < 0.001)
and adipocyte size (P ¼ 0.01; ref. 68). In addition, increased
NF-kB–binding activity and elevated aromatase expression and
enzyme activity were found in the inflamed breast tissue of
overweight and obese women (68).
In summary, the current evidence on the local interaction
between breast WAT and breast cancer cells supports the
hypothesis that adipose tissue inflammation, defined by the
presence of crown-like structures, is a key player in cancer
growth and progression. However, the involvement of steroid
hormones as drivers of tumor progression represents an addi-
tional important aspect of the adipose–cancer link, particularly
in hormone-dependent cancers, such as breast or endometrial
cancer (17, 86–88).
Colorectal cancer. Four studies were identified that have inves-
tigated the crosstalk between adipose tissue and colorectal
cancer (8, 64, 71). Nested in the international cohort study
ColoCare,
Liesenfeld
and
colleagues
used
a
multiomic
approach to investigate differences between VAT compared
with SAT in patients with colorectal cancer (8). They compre-
hensively assessed differences in metabolic, lipidomic, and
transcriptomic profiles in paired human VAT and SAT samples
and their association with colorectal cancer tumor stage (8).
Mass spectrometry was used to measure 1,065 metabolites in
adipose tissue and 1,810 metabolites in serum of n ¼ 59
patients, and parallel genome-wide gene expression data were
used to perform integrated analyses of candidate metabolites
(8). Compared with SAT, VAT was characterized by elevated
markers of inflammatory lipid metabolism, phospholipases
(PLA2G10), free arachidonic acid, and prostaglandin synthe-
sis–related enzymes (PTGD/PTGS2S; ref. 8). Several lipids
showed a linear association with increasing tumor stage (not
significant after correction for multiple testing; ref. 8).

 In the same year, Amor and colleagues collected VAT of n ¼ 18
colorectal cancer patients and n ¼ 18 healthy controls (73).
Participants were classified into four groups: (i) obese with cancer;
(ii) lean with cancer; (iii) obese without cancer; and (iv) lean
without cancer (73). Tissue samples were divided into peritu-
moral and nontumoral fat. Their results showed that the secretion
activity of peritumoral adipose tissue in cancer patients was higher
compared with the control groups and nontumoral tissue samples
(73). Tissue samples from obese cancer patients also had an
increased rate of secretion compared with lean patients (73).
Another study examined regional differences (peritumoral
and distant from neoplasia) in the expression of lipogenic
enzymes (e.g., lipoprotein lipase and fatty acid synthase) and
their influence on events that sustain colorectal cancer growth
(64). The evaluation of n ¼ 32 adipose tissue samples of
colorectal cancer patients [adjacent (not defined) and distant
(about 10 cm)] to neoplasia showed that lipoprotein lipase as
well as fatty acid synthase were less expressed in adipose tissue
adjacent to the tumor compared with adipose tissue distant
from the cancer (64). The results underline the influence of

 cancer cells on environmental adipose tissue's lipid metabo-
lism, demonstrating a cancer-induced impairment in the for-
mation and lipid-storing capacity of adjacent adipose tissue in
patients with colorectal cancer (64).
In a small case–control study, differences in VAT gene expres-
sion
of
proinflammatory
and
angiogenesis-related
factors
between 11 colorectal cancer patients and 18 healthy individuals
were assessed (71). Gene expression of lipocalin-2, osteopontin,
chitinase-3 like-1, TNFa, HIF1A, and VEGFA was significantly
elevated in VAT of colorectal cancer patients.
These results suggest that inflammatory factors in VAT of
colorectal cancer patients are elevated and may accelerate cancer
development or progression (71).
In summary, the inflammatory features of the adipose tissue
environment embedding the colon and rectum seem to play a
crucial role when investigating the tumor-promoting effects
of adipose tissue. Only one study considered the reciprocal
influence of the tumor on the surrounding adipose tissue.
Focusing on only lipogenic enzymes, this study illustrates that
the adipose tissue–tumor interaction needs to be considered in
both directions.
Esophageal cancer. A recent study reported that esophageal
peritumoral adipose tissue and its secretion of tumor-promot-
ing factors are directly correlated with increased tumor growth
(65). Studying the morphologic, histologic, and molecular
characteristics of peritumoral and omental adipose tissue in
esophageal cancer patients (n ¼ 60), the study was designed to
investigate whether adipose depot-specific differences affect
tumor behavior (65). Only in peritumoral adipose tissue,
increased adipocyte size was directly associated with leptin
expression, angiogenesis (CD31), and lymph angiogenesis
(podoplanin; ref. 65). Thus, peritumoral adipose tissue may
directly accelerate the progression of esophageal cancer by
secreting paracrine factors; the adipokine leptin seems to be
a key player in this crosstalk (65).
Lysaght and colleagues performed flow cytometry to assess the
activation of T cells and cytokine production in VAT (omental
adipose tissue) of n ¼ 35 esophageal cancer patients (79). A large
number of lymphocytes were observed in the omentum (79).
Both CD4þ and CD8þ T cells showed significantly increased
expression of the T-cell activation markers CD69 (P < 0.001) and
CD107a (CD8þ T cells: P < 0.01) compared with blood, as well as
reduced CD62L expression (P < 0.05). Similarly, higher propor-
tions of CD45ROþ T cells compared with CD45RAþ T cells were
present. IFNg was significantly elevated in VAT, compared with
blood and subcutaneous adipose tissue (P < 0.01; ref. 79). Over-
all, this study confirmed that VAT is a major source of activated
proinflammatory lymphocytes, which may help fuel chronic
inflammation (79).
Although the number of studies in esophageal cancer is limited,
they highlight two important aspects. First, the theme of inflam-
matory mechanisms as a key player in the adipose–cancer link is
also prominent in this cancer type; second, the fascinating work by
Travellin and colleagues (65) highlights the role of peritumoral
adipocytes as a carcinogenic driver in esophageal cancer and
possibly beyond.
Colorectal and esophageal cancer (combined). In 2011, one study
investigated the differences in cytokine and adipokine expres-
sion of VAT and SAT from normal-weight and centrally obese
gastrointestinal
cancer
patients
(including
colorectal
and
esophageal cancer) and their effects on colorectal and esoph-
ageal cancer cell lines (80). They observed a higher IL6, VEGF,
and LEP gene expression in VAT compared with SAT and a
higher IL6 and VEGF protein secretion from VAT into condi-
tioned media compared with SAT (80). Adipose tissue–condi-
tioned media from centrally obese patients induced significant-
ly more proliferation in both esophageal and colorectal cancer
cell lines, compared with adipose tissue–conditioned media
from nonobese patients. Greater proliferation of cancer cell
lines was observed after culture with VAT-conditioned media,
compared with SAT-conditioned media. (80). This study illus-
trates the elevated expression of inflammatory and angiogen-
esis-related factors in VAT compared with SAT of cancer patients
and translates it directly back to impact gastrointestinal cancer
cell lines. In particular, the link via VEGF highlights a potential
mechanism whereby VAT from centrally obese patients may
drive carcinogenic progression (80).
Endometrial cancer. To identify obesity-related endometrial can-
cer genes via microarray analysis in endometrial and adipose
tissues, Modesitt and colleagues collected endometrial tissue,
VAT, and SAT in n ¼ 8 (n ¼ 4 with endometrial cancer, n ¼ 4
without endometrial cancer) individuals undergoing hysterecto-
my (72). The authors noted no differences in hormone/metab-
olite levels between groups (72). Gene set enrichment analysis
contrasting patients with and without endometrial cancer showed
that endometrial, VAT, and SAT displayed 40, 47, and 38 alter-
natively regulated gene set pathways, respectively (72). Eighteen
pathways were regulated in opposite directions between VAT
and SAT (72).
The results from this pilot study suggest that SAT and VAT have
opposite patterns of gene expression in obese patients with and
without endometrial cancer and may provide new potential
targets for cancer treatment and prevention for obese women.
However, considering the small sample size of this first study,
more research is needed.
Prostate cancer. Although visceral obesity has been associated
with worse prognosis for prostate cancer patients, periprostatic
adipose tissue may lead to an increase in the aggressive growth
of this disease (69, 74, 81, 82). A recent study analyzed the
expression of IL6, leptin, and adiponectin in periprostatic
adipose tissues specimens from n ¼ 30 prostate patients and
n ¼ 10 noncancer controls (82). IL6, leptin, and adiponectin
gene expression was higher in the samples from prostate
cancer patients compared with controls (P < 0.001; ref. 82).
Furthermore, IL6 expression in adipose tissue was associated
with increased aggressiveness of prostate cancer (P ¼ 0.001;
ref. 82).
One
study
collected
periprostatic
and
subcutaneous
adipose tissue in n ¼ 40 prostate cancer patients (81). In
culture with either prostate cancer cells or endothelial cells,
the periprostatic adipose tissue showed higher proliferative
effects compared with SAT (81). Furthermore, this result
was more significant in samples of obese patients (BMI �
30 kg/m2) compared with overweight (25–30 kg/m2) or lean
(<25 kg/m2) patients (81).
Ribeiro and colleagues (69) conducted a study with n ¼ 18

three groups based on postsurgical diagnosis and pathologic

 analysis. Differentially expressed genes in the periprostatic tissue
were investigated by microarrays (69). In the tissues of obese and
overweight individuals, an increased expression was observed in
genes that are involved in adipogenic, proliferative, and mild
immunoinflammatory processes (e.g., LEP, ANGPT1; ref. 69). In
patients with prostate cancer, the expression profile of peripro-
static adipose tissue was consistent with hypercellularity and
reduced immunosurveillance (69). The authors concluded that
their findings are consistent with periprostatic adipose tissue
among obese individuals providing a favorable environment for
prostate cancer progression (69).
In 2009, another study collected periprostatic adipose tissue
samples from n ¼ 7 patients undergoing surgery treatment
(74). Analyzing the cytokine expression in the tissue samples,
their results showed a 375 times higher expression of IL6 in the
per-prostatic adipose tissue compared with the patients' serum
sample (74). Furthermore, the phosphorylation cell signaling
of STAT3 in periprostatic adipose tissue was greater with high-
grade tumors (74).
All studies of prostate cancer collected periprostatic adipose
tissue and suggest that altered adipose tissue metabolism in
obese individuals forms a more auspicious microenvironment
for prostate cancer development. An increase in cell prolifera-
tion and expression of proliferative genes, as well as IL6, has
been detected in expanded periprostatic adipose tissue of obese
individuals. However, the results need to be confirmed in
studies with larger sample sizes.
ENT cancer. To assess the association between WAT inflamma-
tion of the tongue environmental adipose tissue and squamous
cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tongue, Iyengar and colleagues
analyzed n ¼ 125 tissue samples from oral cancer patients (83).
The presence of dead or dying adipocytes surrounded by
macrophages forming crown-like structures was defined as WAT
inflammation (83). Thirty-nine percent of the patients pre-
sented WAT inflammation, and this was statistically significant-
ly associated with BMI, increased tumor thickness, and vascular
invasion (P < 0.05; ref. 83). The cancer-specific survival rate was
with 59% [95% confidence interval (CI), 46–76] lower for
patients presenting WAT inflammation compared with patients
without (82%; 95% CI, 72–92; ref. 83). In n ¼ 70 patients with
early-stage SCC (without lymph node involvement, no indica-
tion for adjuvant therapy), tongue WAT inflammation was
significantly associated with both decreased cancer-specific and
overall survival (P < 0.05; ref. 83).
The results of this study suggest that inflammation of neck and
tongue WAT plays an important role in the development and
growth of oral cancers. However, considering that this is the first
study of this cancer type, further investigations are needed to
confirm the results.
Conclusions
Obesity is an established risk and progression factor for many
cancers (e.g., breast, colorectal, esophageal), but the underlying
mechanisms are incompletely understood. A potential crosstalk
between adipose tissue and carcinomas may contribute impor-
tantly to the observed associations between obesity and increased
cancer risk and/or progression.
In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that adipose tissue is
enriched for hormones, cytokines, and other mediators (e.g.,
leptin, adiponectin). This milieu has already been characterized
as a growth-promoting and proinflammatory microenviron-
ment. More recent investigations have used a set of multiomic
techniques,
including
transcriptomics
and
metabolomics,
yielding novel signals, as well as integrated effects on pathways
(10). They also demonstrated clear distinctions of the adipose
tissue
type
(visceral
vs.
subcutaneous)
by
these
-omic
characterizations.
Here, results of n ¼ 20 human clinical studies indicate that
(i) there is a direct/specific crosstalk between adipose tissue and
carcinomas, likely with different mechanisms and different
directions depending on the organ system; (ii) WAT is more
important than other adipose pools in this pattern of cellular
communication; and (iii) VAT plays a central role, as it is
metabolically more active than SAT. In addition, peritumoral
adipose tissue that is directly present in the organ may provide
an imminently present microenvironment that fosters carcino-
genic progression. Whether the mediators and intensity of
crosstalk between adipose tissue and cancer is affected by the
tissue distance is an important but currently unanswered
question.
Despite the intriguing results of studies presented within
this systematic review, we still miss the complete picture that
elucidates the mechanisms underlying the adipose–tumor
crosstalk. In addition to the limitation of small sample sizes
in most studies, other aspects that are relevant in inflammatory
processes were often not reported or assessed. Inflammation
can be modified by several environmental factors, such as
age, smoking, medication use, and diet. Even though adding
another layer of complexity, such variability in the investigat-
ed study populations should be considered. Furthermore, as
detailed above, distinct adipose tissue compartments have
different metabolic capabilities. These potentially generate
adipose tissue-specific forces that affect the tumor, locally or
systemically. However, only a limited number of studies
assessed or have the means to assess the distribution of
adipose tissue compartments in individuals. Rather than rely-
ing on BMI, the amount of adipose tissue in a patient and its
distribution would be much more informative to investigate
the effect of adipose tissues on carcinogenesis to identify
means of specific intervention.
Consequently, there is a clear need for larger and more
comprehensive investigations of the adipose tissue as a central
player in explaining the obesity–cancer link. Overall, data of
the human clinical studies, as well as in vitro and in vivo studies,
suggest that efforts to eavesdrop and ultimately interfere with
this cancer-enhancing crosstalk between adipose tissue and
carcinomas may lead to new targets and strategies for decreas-
ing the burden of obesity-related cancers.
