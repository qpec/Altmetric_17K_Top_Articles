Abstract
The phenomenon of ‘microdosing’, that is, regular ingestion of very small quantities of psy-
chedelic substances, has seen a rapid explosion of popularity in recent years. Individuals
who microdose report minimal acute effects from these substances yet claim a range of
long-term general health and wellbeing benefits. There have been no published empirical
studies of microdosing and the current legal and bureaucratic climate makes direct empirical
investigation of the effects of psychedelics difficult. In Study One we conducted a system-
atic, observational investigation of individuals who microdose. We tracked the experiences
of 98 microdosing participants, who provided daily ratings of psychological functioning over
a six week period. 63 of these additionally completed a battery of psychometric measures
tapping mood, attention, wellbeing, mystical experiences, personality, creativity, and sense
of agency, at baseline and at completion of the study. Analyses of daily ratings revealed a
general increase in reported psychological functioning across all measures on dosing days
but limited evidence of residual effects on following days. Analyses of pre and post study
measures revealed reductions in reported levels of depression and stress; lower levels of
distractibility; increased absorption; and increased neuroticism. To better understand these
findings, in Study Two we investigated pre-existing beliefs and expectations about the
effects of microdosing in a sample of 263 naïve and experienced microdosers, so as to
gauge expectancy bias. All participants believed that microdosing would have large and
wide-ranging benefits in contrast to the limited outcomes reported by actual microdosers.
Notably, the effects believed most likely to change were unrelated to the observed pattern of
reported outcomes. The current results suggest that dose controlled empirical research on
the impacts of microdosing on mental health and attentional capabilities are needed.
Introduction
Microdosing refers to the practice of ingesting a very low dose of a psychedelic substance [1].
There has been little peer-reviewed research on microdosing but there are numerous blogs
and online communities that discuss the practice, with detailed guides to methods and anec-
dotal reports of outcomes (e.g., www.microdosing.com; www.reddit.com/microdosing/wiki).

 Typical doses can be as small as one twentieth of a typical recreational dose, sometimes even
less [2]. So, for example, a microdose of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) might be 6–25 micro-
grams, or a microdose of psilocybin might be .1 to .5 grams of dried mushrooms [3]. People
microdose using a wide range of different substances, although LSD and psilocybin are the
most commonly discussed in online forums [4].
Psychedelics have typically been associated with marked alterations in cognition, affect, per-
ception, and neurophysiology [5]. Individuals who have taken psychedelics typically describe
pronounced changes in visual and auditory perception, accompanied by vivid imaginative
experiences and intense emotions. This is not the case with microdosing. Microdosing is fre-
quently described as involving a ‘sub-threshold’ dose [6]. That is, individuals aim to identify a
dose at which they do not feel ‘high’. In other words, when microdosing there are only mini-
mal identifiable acute drug effects.
People follow a variety of different schedules when microdosing, sometimes taking a dose
each day but much more frequently interspersing dosing days with rest days. One common
schedule is to microdose every three days [7]. The idea behind this regimen is that there may
be a residual effect from each microdose that lasts one to two days afterwards. Most popular
press stories on microdosing have mentioned this three day cycle [8,9].
Despite the reported lack of acute effects of microdosing, proponents claim a wide variety
of psychological and social benefits from regular microdosing, including increases in vitality,
creativity, productivity, social ability, focus, analytic thinking, positive mood, memory, mind-
fulness and general wellbeing [10]. Microdosing is thus a curious phenomenon: on the one
hand advocates deny experiencing the alterations in consciousness that characterise typical
doses, yet claim significant psychological benefits from regular use.
The earliest occurrence of microdosing is unknown. Anthropological reports indicate that
many traditional cultures incorporated use of psychedelic plants such as peyote, morning
glory seeds and psilocybin containing mushrooms into many aspects of daily life [11]. These
substances were used as a catalyst for ritual religious experience [12], but also used at lower
doses as an aphrodisiac, to reduce hunger, inspire courage, nullify pain, and to treat ailments
such as gout and syphilis [13]. These uses highlight that although psychedelics are now com-
monly associated with marked alterations in consciousness, they also have also been used his-
torically at low doses for therapeutic benefits and functional enhancement.
The modern practice of microdosing is quite a recent phenomenon. Albert Hofman, the
discover of LSD, mentioned the use of very low doses of LSD (25 micrograms) in passing dur-
ing in a 1976 interview [14] but we have not been able to identify any other records from Dr
Hofman or his contemporaries describing microdosing. Stanislav Grof developed psycholytic
psychotherapy [15] as a form of psychedelic assisted therapy that involved small amounts of
LSD, but the lower range for doses was over 100 micrograms—considerably higher than con-
temporary microdosing. There was no formal research on microdosing prior to the prohibi-
tion of psychedelic research in 1966.
The current popularity of microdosing can be traced back to a book, The Psychedelic
Explorers Guide by James Fadiman [1]. This was the first publication to describe microdosing
in detail. Fadiman outlined the purported benefits of regular microdosing, with a recommen-
dation to follow a three-day cycle, and guidelines for appropriate doses. This publication also
contained a collection of case reports from individuals about their microdosing experiences,
emphasising positive improvements in creativity, focus, affect, and relationships. In the years
following this publication, a number of news articles appeared reporting on the growing inter-
est in microdosing. The first major publication to report on the phenomenon was Rolling
Stone [16]. This article triggered considerable popular media interest in microdosing psyche-
delics that has led to over 1200 news articles on the topic since that time. Many stories in the

 popular press have focused on microdosing as tool for increased productivity, particularly for
people working in the technology sector [17–19]. This sudden high level of almost exclusively
positive news coverage has been accompanied by the emergence of multiple communities of
microdosers on social media. For example, a forum on microdosing on reddit.com has over
24,000 members who report on their experiences and compare notes on methodologies, out-
comes and protocols. The comprehensive news coverage and active online communities of
microdosers have led to a situation where large numbers of individuals are experimenting with
microdosing, with the expectation that this practice leads to substantial psychological and well-
being benefits.
To date there are four scientific articles on microdosing. Three of these indicate potential
benefits from microdosing. First, Johnstad [20] conducted a series of interviews with microdo-
sers, who reported generally positive outcomes, including improved mood, energy levels and
cognition. Second, in an open label study, Prochazkova et al. [21] found that microdosing led
to increases in convergent and divergent thinking–common indicators of creativity. Third, a
large cross sectional study found that microdosers reported reduced levels of negative attitudes
and emotions, and increased wisdom, open-mindedness and creativity, relative to people who
had never microdosed [22]. Fourth, the most scientifically rigorous study to date, was a double
blind placebo controlled study by Yanakieva et al. [23]. This study showed changes in time per-
ception following microdosing, but did not investigate variables related to health or wellbeing.
In addition to this formal research, microdosers’ expectations are likely based on informal
case reports, anecdotes, unpublished studies, and online publications [3,24–26]. Although
microdosing is understudied, its sudden popular interest has occurred within a context of
growing scientific attention on the effects of psychedelics taken at higher doses [27]. After a
long period of minimal research with psychedelic compounds as a result of government prohi-
bitions, an increasing number of research teams have in recent years reported compelling find-
ings suggesting both improved psychological functioning [28] and potential therapeutic
benefits [29] associated with a range of psychedelic substances.
When administered to healthy individuals in a supportive setting, both psilocybin [30–33]
and LSD [34], have been shown to elicit mystical-type experiences that are characterised as
highly meaningful and transformative by participants. In the case of psilocybin, Griffiths et al.
[31] reported persisting self and observer rated positive effects on attitudes, mood and behav-
iour 14 months after ingestion, with 58% of participants reporting that their psilocybin experi-
ence was among the five most personally meaningful experiences of their lives. Psilocybin [35]
and LSD [36] have also both been shown to bias emotional processing toward positive infor-
mation and to attenuate responses to fearful stimuli. In addition psilocybin has been shown to
increase emotional empathy [37], whereas LSD has been shown to increase feelings of well-
being, closeness to others and trust [38]; increase emotional response and personal meaning-
fulness to music [39,40]; and increase suggestibility [41].
In more clinically oriented research, both psilocybin and LSD have shown promise as treat-
ments for end of life anxiety. In a double blind, randomised crossover trial of psilocybin assis-
ted psychotherapy as a treatment of anxiety and depression in terminal cancer patients,
Griffiths et al. [42] found remission in both depressive and anxious symptoms for over 60% of
patients at 6 month follow up. A similar trial of LSD assisted psychotherapy by Gasser, Kirch-
ner and Passie [43] found significant reductions in state and trait anxiety that were maintained
at 12-month follow up. Psilocybin has also been shown to reduce the symptoms of treatment
resistant depression [44], and to dramatically reduce consumption levels when trialled as a
treatment for tobacco addition [45,46], and alcohol dependence [47].
As a result of this increased research activity, researchers are developing a clearer picture of
the psychopharmacological mechanisms that underlie psychedelic substances. A comprehensive

 review of the mechanisms of action of psychedelics is provided by Nichols [5]. Briefly, it is well
established that classic serotonergic psychedelics such as psilocybin, dimenthyltryptamine
(DMT), mescaline and LSD act (at least partially) through an agonistic effect on 5-HT2A recep-
tors throughout the brain [48], and recent work has suggested that long term use of psychedelics
may lead to structural changes in the posterior and anterior cingulate cortices [49]. Recent
research has also indicated that psychedelics lead to reduced activity in the default mode net-
work, a network of brain regions thought to support general background activity associated
with the functions of normal waking consciousness, such as metacognition, social attributions
and self reflection [50]. This reduction in typical neural activity is accompanied with an increase
in connectivity between brain regions that usually function relatively independently [51].
New findings on the effects of higher dose psychedelics are being published at a rapid rate,
and overall the emerging research suggests that these substances may have beneficial impacts
across a range of psychological, cognitive, affective, and psychosocial domains. These findings
have informed the cultural narrative around microdosing and the broad scope of constructs
that appear to be influenced by psychedelics taken at higher doses is consistent with the diverse
range of effects described by proponents of microdosing. Furthermore, research into the role
of psychedelics in the brain provides at least a plausible account of the potential neural mecha-
nisms of microdosing.
There has been no specific research into the safety of microdosing, however research
with higher doses of psychedelics suggests that these substances are relatively safe [52]. Indi-
viduals do sometimes have disturbing experiences on psychedelics, including negative emo-
tions, perceptual disturbances, and even psychotic symptoms, and these effects can have a
persisting negative impact for some people [53,54]. In general, however, psychedelics are
not addictive [55], and large scale population studies have not found any association
between use of psychedelics and negative mental health outcomes [56]. Longitudinal
research even suggests that lifetime use of psychedelics may be associated with lower levels
of psychological distress [57] and reduced suicidality [58]. A number of studies have ranked
the comparative risks of different types of drugs for both the user and broader society; these
studies have consistently found that psychedelics are among the least harmful substances,
with far less personal and societal risks than legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco [59,60].
The doses involved in microdosing are considerably smaller than typical doses and so it
may seem reasonable to assume that any risks would be diminished, but it is worth noting
that psychedelics are usually taken relatively infrequently, even by enthusiasts. It is possible
that chronic low-dose exposure to psychedelics, as occurs in microdosing, may involve
unknown risks [61].
The motivation for the current study was to attempt to resolve some of the unknown ques-
tions around microdosing. There is currently considerable popular interest in this practice
with indications that a great many individuals are experimenting with regular low doses of
psychedelics [9]. Online discourse on microdosing presents a wide range of potential positive
benefits. The prominence of these positive claims may lead individuals to develop expectations
about what their own experience of microdosing will be like, and these expectancies them-
selves may influence participants’ reports. The potential role of expectancy effects may be
amplified by two factors. First, most individuals who become curious about microdosing
would likely need to go to some effort (and some risk) to source and prepare psychedelic sub-
stances in order to begin experimenting. It is reasonable to suppose that this effort would lead
to a sense of investment in the expected outcome, and may bias individuals to perceive the
effects they are expecting. Second, as described above, the immediate effect of each microdose
is only a very minimal (“subthreshold”) alteration in consciousness. Microdosers may

 interpret these subtle and ambiguous effects in line with their expectations. We explore the
role of expectancy or placebo effects in Study Two.
On the other hand, there are plausible neurobiological mechanisms that may account for
microdosing effects, and a growing body of research suggesting a range of reliable positive
benefits from higher doses of psychedelics [62]. There have been no published empirical stud-
ies of microdosing and it is unclear how accurate anecdotal reports of benefits are. The current
legal and bureaucratic climate makes direct empirical investigation of the effects of psychedel-
ics difficult and the approval process for experimental work is prohibitively lengthy. With this
background, we designed a study that could be completed relatively rapidly, as an initial
exploratory investigation into the effects of microdosing.
We aimed to carefully track a cohort of healthy individuals who microdose in a systematic,
observational study to see if measures taken using well validated psychometric assessments
would match anecdotal claims regarding the effects of microdosing. Although individuals
microdose with a wide range of substances we restricted our analysis to a group of substances
with similar psychopharmacology: serotonergic psychedelics [63,64]. This subclass of sub-
stances (which includes LSD, psilocybin, mescaline and number of synthetic ‘research chemi-
cals’) all act upon 5-HT receptor sites.
We identified psychological variables that may be affected by microdosing in three ways: by
reviewing descriptions of microdosing effects in online forums and media reports; by refer-
ence to scientific reports of the effects of higher doses of psychedelics [30,44,65–67]; and in
consultation with James Fadiman (personal communication, February 20, 2016). Nine
domains were selected for investigation: mood, attention, wellbeing, mindfulness, mystical
experiences, personality, absorption, creativity, and sense of agency.
Study One
In Study One we tracked the experiences of microdosers over a period of six weeks. This time
period was selected to provide enough time for microdosers to complete multiple dose-rest
cycles, and to allow a reasonable amount of time to elapse between baseline and post-study
measures. We tracked participants in two ways: through daily emails asking for brief ratings of
psychological functioning, and through comprehensive questionnaire batteries at baseline and
at completion of the study.
Method
Supplementary materials and data from this project are available at on the Open Science
Framework at osf.io/6xfm8/
Participants
Participants were recruited through posts on online communities of microdosers. A recruit-
ment notice was posted on the websites reddit.com/r/microdosing, bluelight.org, and in psy-
chedelic discussion groups on facebook.com. The study was open from April 2016 to April
2017.
1181 participants clicked through to the study webpage. Of these, 251 (21.25%) participants
completed the baseline questionnaire. We eliminated duplicate responses (n = 4), and also
excluded participants who did not report any microdosing during the study period (n = 149).
98 participants sent at least one daily report of microdosing with a serotonergic psychedelic
and were included in the analysis of daily ratings. 63 of these participants completed the post-
study questionnaire and were included in the long term analysis of pre and post study mea-
sures. Of these 63, 14 (22.2%) participants were female, 49 (77.8%) were male. In order to

 maximise anonymity participants nominated age ranges rather than divulging exact ages. 13
(20.6%) participants were aged 18–25, 31 (49.2%) were aged 26–35, 11 (17.5%) were aged 36–
45, 7 (11.1%) were aged 46–55, and 1 (1.6%) was aged 56+. Participants were mainly from Aus-
tralia (29.0%), USA (17.6%) and Canada (12.9%). The sample was highly educated with 71.4%
participants having completed postgraduate education. 19.0% participants were students and
76.2% were working full time or part time.
Based on responses taken at baseline, this sample was experienced with psychedelics but
reported relatively moderate experience with other drugs. Specifically, 6 participants (9.5%)
reported using psychedelics more than once a week, 14 (22.2%) used psychedelics a few times
a month, 33 (52.4%) a few times a year, and 10 (15.9%) had no prior experience of psychedel-
ics. We also asked participants about their use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
(MDMA), methamphetamine, opiates and other similar drugs (excluding cannabis). 2 partici-
pants (3.2%) reported using other drugs more than once a week, 5 (7.9%) a few times a month,
30 (47.6%) a few times a year, and 26 (41.3%) reported no previous experience with other
drugs.
Procedure
Upon accessing the study webpage participants were presented with an overview of the study
requirements and safety information (see supplementary material at osf.io/6xfm8/). Partici-
pants were informed that in order to take part they must be aware of microdosing, regardless
of whether or not they had actually ever microdosed. Participants were asked not to take part
if they had any history or current diagnosis of primary psychotic disorder, mood disorder,
anxiety disorder, dissociative disorder or substance disorder. All interactions with participants
were conducted through automated emails and online Qualtrics surveys. Participants were
provided with instructions on how to create an anonymous email account and encouraged to
use this to sign up to the study. When first signing up, participants completed a baseline bat-
tery of measures investigating mood, attention, wellbeing, mindfulness, mystical experiences,
personality, absorption, creativity, and sense of agency. At the completion of the study (i.e.,
after 6 weeks) participants repeated this battery of measures. At post-study participants also
completed the Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale [68] and the Persisting Effects
Questionnaire [30]. These measures were not analysed in the current study, but for complete-
ness summary statistics are provided as Table A in S1 File. The baseline and post-study batter-
ies each took approximately 50 minutes to complete. Additionally, participants received a
daily email each day for a period of 42 days with a link to complete a brief series of daily ratings
about their experiences. Daily ratings took less than 5 minutes to complete. Participants were
not offered any incentive to take part in the research. Ethics approval for this study was pro-
vided by Macquarie University Ethics Committee and electronic consent was provided by
each participant.
Materials
Daily ratings.
Participants were invited to complete a brief rating scale each day during
the study, adapted from Fadiman’s [2] protocol. Participants were first asked if they had
microdosed on the previous day. If they had, they were asked to report the substance and dos-
age. Participants then gave a single rating for feelings of each of the following: Connectedness,
Contemplation, Creativity, Focus, Happiness, Productiveness, and Wellbeing during the previ-
ous day (e.g. “How connected did you feel yesterday?”). Ratings were made on a 5-point Likert
scale from ‘much less than average’ to ‘much more than average’. This scale was designed for
brevity and took less than two minutes to complete.

 Long term measures.
Participants completed a comprehensive battery of questionnaires
when first signing up for the study and then again at the conclusion of the study, after 6 weeks
of microdosing. This battery investigated nine domains of psychological functioning. These
are described below and summarised in Table 1.
Mental Health: Depression and Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) [69]. The DASS question-
naire measures the severity of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms. We used the 21-item
version of the scale. Participants rated the frequency or severity of items such as “I tended to
over-react to situations” over the previous week on a 4-point Likert-type scale (from “did not
apply to me at all” to “applied to me very much”). We used all three subscale scores in our anal-
yses: Depression, Anxiety and Stress.
Attention: Mind Wandering Questionnaire (MWQ) [70]. The MWQ is a five item, unidi-
mensional scale that measures deviations in attention away from the task at hand. Participants
rate their level of agreement on items such as “I have difficulty maintaining focus on simple or
repetitive work” on a 6-point Likert-type scale (from “almost never” to “almost always”). We
used the mean MWQ score in our analyses.
Wellbeing: Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI) [71]. The QOLI is a 32 item scale that mea-
sures life satisfaction across 16 dimensions. Participants rate the importance of each life
dimension on a 3-point Likert-type scale (from “not Important” to “important”) and their
level of satisfaction with each life dimension on a 6-point Likert-type scale (from “very dissatis-
fied” to “very satisfied”). Due to a coding error, scores were only recorded for 11 life dimen-
sions: health, self-esteem, goals and values, money, work, play, learning, helping, love and
friends. A modified total QOLI score was calculated by multiplying the importance and satis-
faction ratings for each dimension and then summing these scores.
Mindfulness: Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) [72]. The MAAS is a 15 item,
unidimensional scale that measures the frequency of mindful, receptive awareness of the pres-
ent moment. Participants rate their level of agreement with items such as “I do jobs or tasks
automatically, without being aware of what I’m doing” on a 6-point Likert-type scale (from
“almost always” to “almost never”). We used the mean MAAS score in our analyses.

 Mystical experiences: Hood Mysticism Scale (HMS) [73]. The HMS is a 32 item scale that
measures the degree to which an individual has had experiences that can be considered mysti-
cal during their lifetime. Participants rate their level of agreement with items such as “I have
had an experience which I was unable to express adequately through language” on a 5-point
Likert scale (from “definitely true” to “definitely not true”). We used the HMS total score in
our analyses.
Personality: M5P Personality Questionnaire (M5P) [74]. The M5P is a 50 item, freely
accessible measure with subscales for each domain of the 5-factor model of personality. Partici-
pants rate their level of agreement with items such as “I make friends easily” on a 5-point
Likert scale (from “inaccurate” to “accurate”). We used the five personality subscale scores in
our analyses: Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Openness.
Absorption: Tellegen Absorption Scale (TAS) [75]. The TAS is a 34 item scale that mea-
sures disposition toward intense imaginative experiences, and a capacity to experience peak-
like altered states of consciousness. Participants make true/false ratings for items such as
“Sometimes I can change noise into music by the way I listen to it”. We used the TAS total
score in our analyses.
Creativity: Creative Personality Scale (CPS) [76]. The CPS is comprised of two parts.
General creativity is assessed through 20 items such as “I do unexpected things”, scored on a
5-point Likert scale (from “very inaccurate” to “very accurate”). Specific creativity is assessed
through 10 items such as “How creative are you in the area of mathematics”, scored on 5-point
Likert scale (from “not at all” to “extremely”). A total CPS score was calculated by summing
the general and specific components. This total score was used in our analyses.
Agency: Sense of Agency Rating Scale (SOARS) [77]. The SOARS is a 10 item question-
naire with two subscales that measure distinct aspects of the sense of agency: Involuntariness,
the sense that events that occur are externally generated; and Effortlessness, feelings of actions
occurring easily and spontaneously. Participants rate their level of agreement with items such
as “my experiences and actions were under my control” on a 7-point Likert scale (from
“strongly disagree” to “very strongly agree”). We used the general form of the scale reported in
Pritchard, Zopf, Polito, Kaplan and Williams [78]. Involuntariness and Effortlessness subscale
scores were used in our analyses.
Debrief questions.
Finally, at the conclusion of the study we asked participants a number
of exploratory debrief questions, based on the psilocybin research protocol of Griffiths et al.
[30]. Specifically, participants gave Likert ratings for the following questions: Q1. How person-
ally meaningful were your experiences microdosing during this study? (from 1 = ‘No more than
routine, every day experiences’ to 8 = ‘The single most meaningful experience of my life’); Q2.
Indicate the degree to which your experiences microdosing during this study were spiritually sig-
nificant to you (from 1 = ‘Not at all’ to 6 = ‘The single most spiritually significant experience of
my life’); and Q3. Do you believe that your experiences microdosing during this study have led to
change in your current sense of personal well-being or life satisfaction? (from -3 = ‘Decreased
very much’ to +3 = ‘Increased very much’). At the conclusion of all measures participants also
left brief unstructured comments about their experience in this study.
Results
Microdosing characteristics
Ninety-eight participants sent 1792 daily reports throughout the study, including 489 reports
of microdosing days. Of these reports 3 were excluded due to doses much higher than all other
reported microdoses (one participant reported a dose of 5 grams of psilocybin, and two partic-
ipants reported doses of 150 micrograms of LSD); in addition, a further 8 records were

tion to microdosing on that day (substances included psilocybin, cocaine, DMT, LSD, amphet-
amines, MDMA and GHB). 478 reports of microdosing days were retained.

included common psychedelics such as LSD (48.1% reports), psilocybin (47.1% daily reports),
and mescaline (including synthetic mescaline and San Pedro cactus: 2.1% reports), but also a
range of novel serotonergic psychedelics such as 4-hydroxy-N-methyl-N-ethyltryptamine
(4-HO-MET; 1.0% reports), dimethoxybromoamphetamine (DOB; 0.8% reports), 4-chloro-
2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (2C-C; 0.2% reports), 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenethylamine
(2C-D; 0.2% reports), 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylphenethylamine (2C-E; 0.2% reports) and morn-
ing glory seeds (i.e., lysergic acid amide, LSA; 0.2% reports). Reported doses for each substance
are shown in Table 2. Doses are reported based on numerical recoding of participants textual
reports. Some reports of LSD doses were in a format such as “1/10th dose”, in such cases we
estimated typical doses as 100ug. For psilocybin, some participants reported “1 small shroom”,
we estimated this to be .1g.
Participants reported a high level of certainty that their dosage estimates were accurate. On
a scale from 1 (not confident at all) to 7 (completely confident), the mean confidence rating
was 5.9 (SD = 1.4). Only 3 participants (5.1%) reported confidence in their dose estimates as
less than 4.
Sixty-three participants completed baseline and post-study measures. 20 of these partici-
pants (31.7%) had never microdosed prior to taking part in the study, 12 (19.1%) 1–5 times
prior, 10 (15.9%) 6–10 times prior, 3 (4.8%) 11–20 times prior, 9 (14.3%) 21–50 times prior,
and 9 (14.3%) more than 50 times prior. 16 participants (25.8%) reported using psychedelics at
higher doses, and 6 participants (9.7%) reported using MDMA at least once during the study
period. Participants microdosed 5.0 times on average during the study (SD = 3.6, range 1–19
occasions). The mean time between doses was 6.7 days (SD = 4.8, range 1–34 days).
Daily ratings
We analysed daily ratings from 98 participants using a linear mixed-effects model. Our aim in
this analysis was to determine the effect of microdosing on the day that participants ingested a
dose and the two days following dosing. We calculated the mean of each daily measure (Con-
nectedness, Contemplation, Creativity, Focus, Happiness, Productiveness, and Wellness) on dos-
ing days (Day0), as well as the day immediately following dosing (Day1), and the second day
after dosing (Day2). A Baseline score was calculated as the mean rating for all other days
within the study period (i.e., the mean of scores from all days apart from dosing days and the

 two days following dosing). We used R and nlme [79] to perform a mixed effects analysis of
the effects of microdosing over time. Day type (Baseline, Day0, Day1, Day2) was entered as a
categorical fixed effect. Intercepts for subjects were the only random effects. We were inter-
ested in changes in daily ratings on dosing days (Day0) and the days following dosing (Day1,
Day2) compared to baseline ratings. Visual inspection of residual plots did not reveal any obvi-
ous deviations from homoscedasticity or normality. To ensure a balance of statistical power
and also to minimise type II error, we treated each daily measure as a separate family and cor-
rected for multiple comparisons within each measure using the Holm-Bonferroni adjustment
[80].
Fig 1 shows the pattern of results for all daily ratings. Table 3 reports the mean and standard
deviation of each rating, as well as t-tests and significance for contrasts comparing each day
category (Day0, Day1, Day2) to Baseline. There was a significant increase from Baseline on
dosing days for all measures (all p < .001). This effect was not maintained on the day following
dosing for any measures. Scores for Focused (t = 2.31, p = .044) and Productive (t = 2.61, p =
.019) increased slightly two days following dosing and were significantly higher than baseline
scores. As an indicator of effect size, we report the conditional coefficient of determination
(R2
C) for each rating, as implemented in the R package MuMIn [81,82]. We note that estimat-
ing effect sizes in mixed models is problematic as multiple R-squared measures have been pro-
posed and there is little agreement among researchers as to the best procedure to follow [83].
The R2
C estimates provided here give a relative indication of the variance explained by each
model, but should be interpreted with caution. Table B in S1 File shows the full model sum-
mary for daily ratings.
Long term measures
Our second set of analyses investigated changes across nine domains of psychological func-
tioning (mood, attention, wellbeing, mindfulness, mystical experience, personality, absorption,

 creativity, agency) from baseline (when first signing up for the study) to post study (after 6
weeks of microdosing) for 63 participants. We calculated omega total scores as a measure of
internal consistency for all scales [84]. Internal consistencies were good at both baseline and
post study for all measures (all ωt > .75, see Table C in S1 File). Participants in this study dif-
fered in their prior experience microdosing, and also in their frequency of microdosing during
the study period. We generated linear effects models to map these influences on each measure
over the study period. Our model included Time (baseline vs post study) as a categorical fixed
effect. We also coded prior microdosing experience (Experience) as a categorical fixed effect
with two levels: no prior experience (n = 19) and some prior experience (n = 43). Number of
doses during the study (Doses) was entered as a continuous fixed effect. Intercepts for subjects
were the only random effects. Our model also included an interaction of Time x Experience
and an interaction of Time x Doses. There were three critical analyses in our model: the main
effect of Time, and the two interactions (Time x Experience and Time x Doses). We were not
interested in the main effects of either Experience or Doses (i.e., we primarily wanted to see
how Experience and Dose influenced changes in scores from baseline to post-study, rather than
the overall influence of these main effects averaged across timepoints. Nevertheless, a full
model summary including these main effects is shown as Table D in S1 File).
Visual inspection of residual plots did not reveal any obvious deviations from homoscedas-
ticity or normality. Each subscale in these analyses was treated as a separate family and our
three critical analyses were corrected using the Holm-Bonferroni adjustment. Fig 2 shows the
pattern of changes for all long term measures. Table 4 reports the mean and standard deviation
for each measure at baseline and at conclusion of the study. We also report t tests, corrected p-
values for our three critical tests (main effect of Time, Time x Experience interaction, Time x
Doses interaction), and R2
C as an estimate of the variance explained by each model.
We found a main effect of Time (i.e., change from baseline to post-study scores) for a num-
ber of measures. Participants reported significant improvements in mood: specifically, Depres-
sion (t = -3.97, p = .001) and Stress (t = -3.36, p = .004) decreased during the study period,
indicating participants experienced improvements in their mental health after microdosing.
Mind Wandering decreased significantly during the study period (t = -2.49, p = .047) indicat-
ing that participants were better able maintain focus after microdosing. Absorption increased
significantly over the study period (t = 4.46, p < .001), indicating that participants became
more involved in imaginative experiences after microdosing. The only personality change
indicated by these data was a slight increase in Neuroticism (t = 2.70, p = .027), indicating that
participants tended to experience more negative emotions after microdosing. There were no

 significant interactions of Time x Experience or Time x Doses, suggesting that changes in psy-
chological functioning were not influenced by prior microdosing experience or by the fre-
quency of doses taken during the study period.
There was a trend toward an increase in Effortlessness scores, and to a lesser a degree, a
trend toward an increase in Involuntariness. This indicates that microdosing may have influ-
enced participants’ sense of agency such that actions felt more internally generated (reduction
in Involuntariness) and also more spontaneous (increase in Effortlessness). There was also a
trend toward an interaction of Time x Doses for Conscientiousness, such that those participants
who more regularly took microdoses during the study period scored higher. This finding may
reflect that individuals with conscientious temperaments are those most likely to commit to a
regular schedule when experimenting with microdosing. Each of these trends may indicate
worthwhile directions for future research.
Exploratory debrief questions
For ease of comparison, answers to Debrief Questions were rescaled on scale from 1–100. The
majority of participants did not categorise their experience of microdosing during the study as
particularly meaningful. The mean rating for Q1. How personally meaningful were your experi-
ences microdosing during this study? was 38.95 (SD = 25.71). There were however a minority of
participants who reported that microdosing during the study was extremely meaningful. Five
participants (8.06%) reported that this period of microdosing was ‘among the 5 most meaning-
ful experiences of my life’, and one participant (1.61%) claimed this period of microdosing was
‘the single most meaningful experience of my life’.
Similarly, the vast majority of participants did not report that microdosing during this
study was spiritually significant. The mean rating for Q2. Indicate the degree to which your

 experiences microdosing during this study were spiritually significant to you was 31.69
(SD = 27.86). Again, there were a small number of participants who reported that the experi-
ence had considerable spiritual significance. Five participants (8.06%) reported that this period
of microdosing was ‘among the 5 most spiritually significant experiences of my life’, and two
participants (3.23%) claimed this period of microdosing was ‘the single most spiritually signifi-
cant experience of my life’.
Finally, participants overall reported that microdosing increased feelings of personal well-
being. The mean rating for Q3. Do you believe that your experiences microdosing during this
study have led to change in your current sense of personal well-being or life satisfaction? was
78.55 (SD = 18.05). 54 participants (87.09%) reported that microdosing in this study slightly,
moderately, or very much increased subjective well-being. However, this single item rating
was not correlated with the post study QOLI Total score (which also measured wellbeing), t
(57) = 1.62, p = 0.110.
Study One discussion
Daily ratings provided a snapshot of participants’ subjective experiences on each day of the
study. These ratings revealed that microdosing led to an increase across all psychological func-
tions measured on dosing days, compared to baseline scores. For the most part, these increases

 were not maintained in the days following dosing, although subjective reports of Focus and
Productivity were slightly increased two days after microdosing. These findings indicate that
microdosing led to general increases in psychological functioning rather than specific effects.
The pattern of results here is somewhat inconsistent with narrative accounts that claim that
the effects of microdosing linger for multiple days [8]. However, in the context of media stories
which promote microdosing as a tool for ambitious professionals [16,18], it is notable that two
scores that could be related to increased capacities at work (i.e., Focus and Productivity) did
show an effect two days following dosing.
Detailed long term questionnaires revealed several variables that changed during the micro-
dosing period. Broadly these effects could be characterised as improvements in mental health,
and alterations in processes related to attention.
This study focused on non-clinical effects of microdosing and participants with any self
reported mental illness were asked not to take part. As such, ratings on the DASS scale were
relatively low at baseline. Nevertheless, depression and stress ratings both decreased signifi-
cantly over the course of the study, consistent with reports that microdosing benefits general
mental wellbeing [7].
Participants also reported significant reductions in mind wandering. Reduced mind wan-
dering may lead to a number of benefits that meet the aims of microdosers, including reduced
distractibility and increased capacity to focus on the task at hand [85]. Reduced mind wander-
ing has also been linked with improved educational outcomes [86], and greater levels of happi-
ness [87]. At the neural level, reduced mind wandering has been associated with a reduction in
activity in the default mode network [88]–a phenomenon that has also been reported following
ingestion of psychedelics at higher doses [50].
Participants additionally reported increases in absorption. Absorption has been described
as a type of focused attention characterised by deep involvement with particular aspects of sub-
jective experience [89]. Individuals with high levels of trait absorption are likely to report
intense engagement with nature and aesthetic involvement with art [90]. These characteristics
are consistent with descriptive reports from participants in the current study (see Table 5).
Notably, absorption is closely linked to an individual’s capacity to experience altered states
of consciousness and has been identified as the most important trait predictor of boundary dis-
solution and visual alterations in studies using higher doses of psilocybin [91]. Furthermore,
Ott, Reutger, Hennig and Vait [92] showed that individuals with a particular genetic polymor-
phism linked to stronger binding potential for the 5-HT2A receptor (a key target of serotoner-
gic psychedelics) scored higher on measures of absorption. These previous studies indicate
that individuals with higher pre-existing levels of trait absorption are more likely to experience
stronger effects from psychedelic substances. The novel implication from our findings is that
regular microdosing may also increase individual’s capacity for absorption.
The idea of systematically increasing absorption is not new. Luhrmann, Nusbaum and
Thisted [93] have argued that the rituals and practices of some religious groups are designed to
enhance trait levels of absorption and that this increased capacity leads practitioners to have
more intense religious experiences. It may be that microdosing has a comparable effect,
whereby regular experience of the subtle alterations in consciousness associated with micro-
dosing slowly increase the sensitivity and responsiveness of microdosers to future conscious-
ness alterations.
Participants in this study also reported a small increase in trait neuroticism. Primary per-
sonality traits are typically considered very stable constructs, so any alteration over such a
short period is surprising. An increase in neuroticism is somewhat inconsistent with the results
showing reductions in standardised measures of mental health reported above. This increase
in neuroticism may reflect an overall increase in the intensity of emotions (both positive and

 negative) experienced during periods of microdosing. Reports of intense emotions were com-
mon in participants’ comments, see Table 5 for examples. It may be that as participants
become less distracted (i.e., experience reduced mind wandering) and more absorbed in their
immediate experience, they are more able to identify and process negative emotions.
Many of the domains of psychological functioning investigated did not change during six
weeks of microdosing. Specifically, we did not identify any changes on measures of mindful-
ness, mystical experience, positive personality traits, creativity, sense of agency or overall qual-
ity of life. These results do not support recent findings showing an increase in creative
thinking following microdosing [21]. However, constructs such as creativity [94] and mindful-
ness [95], are particularly difficult to assess using rating scales. As such, these null findings
may reflect insufficient sensitivity of these measures.
Study Two
Some of the domains which did not change in Study One (e.g., creativity and quality of life)
are very commonly described in media stories on the effects of microdosing [96,97]. Con-
versely, some domains that did change in Study One (e.g., absorption, neuroticism) are not
typically mentioned in media stories on microdosing. This indicates that common media nar-
ratives may not match up with people’s experiences when measured in a systematic way. In
Study Two we were interested in how the prominence of microdosing in popular media has
led to specific expectations about the effects of microdosing, and how these expectations
matched or differed from our findings in Study One.
Expectations can affect human behaviour in a range of ways, including influencing hypnotic
responses [98] increasing sensory attenuation [99], and enhancing mindfulness [100]. Expecta-
tions can also have particularly profound impacts on drug effects, even amongst individuals with
no prior experience of a particular substance [101]. Study One recruited participants from online
communities that share and discuss media and personal accounts of microdosing that are mainly
Table 5. Participant comments demonstrating experiences of absorption, intense emotions and unease.
Comments demonstrating experiences of absorption
“[COMMENT D346] I had a very reflective day. I felt blissfully connected with nature and came up with optimistic
ideas for the future.”
“[COMMENT D178] I was finding that all music inspired unique mental imagery. Much like each frequency was
creating a unique figure in my mind’s eye, very fascinating.”
“[COMMENT D175] I had an interesting experience sitting on my porch at my house in the forest. All the sounds in
the forest became an orchestra, it was beautiful, layered and rhythmic.”
“[COMMENT D439] I felt a lot more connected to nature, there are dogs where I am working. I'm not totally
comfortable around dogs, but I sat with 3 of them a while, we were still together while they lay in the sun, I felt
connected and deeply grateful for their trust and support.”
“[COMMENT D183] We went to see a band play, and I found I was able to connect to the music in a deeper way”
Comments demonstrating experiences of intense emotions
“[COMMENT L2] Microdosing has a significant impact on my ability to get in touch with what is going on deep
inside. Although this is not always a pleasant experience, I have a strong feeling that psilocybin helps to reveal what
I need to see in myself and the world.”
“[COMMENT L3] I was surprised to find myself crying a lot throughout the study despite the fact that I wasn't
going through anything typically difficult”.
Comments demonstrating unease about microdosing
[Comment D210] On a microdose I sometimes feel weird or alien to myself and others. And another negative is that
all emotions get amplified. So whenever I feel down or not loved the microdose makes it even harder.
[Comment D308] The first hour was productive but then doubt, confusion, and uncertainty crept in. Found it
difficult to make decisions, felt very unassertive.

 very positive. Participation in these communities may lead to specific expectations that shape indi-
viduals’ experiences of microdosing. Most of the early research on microdosing has not included
a control group or explicitly investigated participant expectations (although see [23]). It was not
practicable for us to directly test placebo responses in this research, but in Study Two we investi-
gated expectations held by members of online microdosing communities to see if these may help
explain the experiences of microdosers in Study One.
We recruited a large sample from the same population as Study One, and asked participants
to rate their expected changes across each of our domains of interest. Participants were asked
not to take part if they had participated in Study One. This study consisted of a single online
questionnaire about microdosing expectations.
Method
Participants
Participants were recruited through the same online networks, and with the same inclusion
and exclusion criteria as Study One. Study Two commenced on 3rd April 2017. We did not
post any new recruitment notices for this study. We simply updated our study webpage so that
from this commencement date, any individuals clicking on links we had previously posted
online were shown information for Study Two. The study was open from April 2017 to July
2017. 501 individuals started the study. 238 records were incomplete and therefore excluded,
leaving 263 participants who completed the microdosing expectations questionnaire. Of these,
152 participants (57.8%) reported never having microdosed previously and 111 (42.8%) had
had experience microdosing. 162 participants (61.6%) were male, 99 (37.6) were female, and 2
(0.8%) did not specify gender. Again, participants nominated age ranges rather than reporting
exact ages. 82 (31.2%) participants were aged 18–25, 78 (29.7%) were aged 26–35, 50 (19.0%)
were aged 36–45, 33 (12.5%) were aged 46–55, and 20 (7.6%) were aged 56+. Participants were
mainly from the USA (64.4%), Australia (15.3%), and Canada (6.5%). The sample was highly
educated with 62.3% participants having completed tertiary education. 22.1% participants
were students and 66.9% were working full time or part time.
Although participants for both Study One and Study Two were drawn from the same popu-
lation, there were some demographic differences between these samples. Specifically, Fisher’s
exact test revealed that the samples differed in age (p = 0.035). This appears to driven by a
greater proportion of participants in the 26–65 age bracket in Study One, whereas participants
were more evenly spread through across age brackets in Study Two. The samples also differed
on country of residence (p < .001), with a greater proportion of participants residing in the
United States in Study Two (64.4%) compared to Study One (17.7%). The samples did not dif-
fer on gender (p = 0.064), education (p = 0.586), or employment status (p = 0.550).
Procedure
As a way of indexing participants’ expectations about the effects of microdosing we generated
a new scale, consisting of items that related to each of the subscales analysed in Study One. We
constructed a statement that described the type of experience tapped by each subscale. For
example, for the DASS Depression subscale, our item was “feelings of depression”. Items for
all subscales are shown in Table 6. Participants were given the following instructions:
What happens when people microdose? Imagine that you personally were to regularly micro-
dose for a period of 6 weeks. If you were to do that, do you think the frequency of each of the
following experiences would be likely to decrease, stay the same, or increase over that time
period?

 Participants’ frequency expectations were scored on a 3-point scale (decrease = -1, stay the
same = 0, increase = +1). In addition, participants were asked to rate their confidence in each
of these directional predictions (from 1 = not at all sure, to 5 = extremely sure).
The study took approximately 15 minutes to complete and there were no incentives for tak-
ing part.
Results
We calculated a weighted expectation score for each item using the R package Hmisc [102].
Weights were calibrated such that the maximum confidence rating carried twice the weight of the
minimum confidence rating (i.e., a confidence rating of 1 was weighted as 1.00, 2 was weighted as
1.25, 3 was weighted as 1.5, 4, was weighted as 1.75, and 5 was weighted as 2.00). The derived
weighted expectation scores ranged from -1 to +1. The rank orders of weighted expectation scores
for naïve and experienced microdosers were highly correlated (Kendall’s τb = .934, p < .001), so

 we report results based on the combined dataset (Table E in S1 File shows weighted expectation
scores for naïve and experienced participants separately). This strong similarity between naïve
and experienced participants indicates that individuals in this population held consistent expecta-
tions about the effects of microdosing regardless of their personal experience.
We performed a one-sample weighted t-test to determine whether expectation scores dif-
fered from 0 for each subscale (i.e., whether participants had a significant expectation that the
frequency of target experiences would increase or decrease). Participants’ (n = 263) expected
that all variables would change following microdosing (all p < = .01; see Table 6). Specifically,
depression, anxiety, stress, mind wandering, neuroticism, and involuntariness were expected
to decrease. Quality of life, mindfulness, mysticism, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientious-
ness, openness, absorption, creativity, and effortlessness were expected to increase. Expecta-
tions in Study Two matched the direction of each of the significant findings in Study One,
with the exception of neuroticism.
We ranked participants’ expectations for each variable, based on the mean weighted expecta-
tion scores. These ranks take into account the expected direction of change such that the first rank
indicates the variable most expected to increase, and the last rank indicates the variable most
expected to decrease. Table 6 also shows the rank order of effects found in Study One (based on t
values for the main effect of Time, and also ordered from the variable that increased the most
through to the variable that decreased the most). A Kendall’s tau-b correlation of these two rank
orderings did not find evidence of an association between expectations in Study Two and effects
in Study One, τb = .283, p = .139. In other words, participants’ ranked expectations about which
variables would change were unrelated to the actual rankings of variables that did change in Study
One. Many of the variables most expected to change in Study Two actually showed relatively
small changes in Study One. Conversely most of the variables that showed the largest changes in
Study One were not those that participants expected would change. This outcome is not consis-
tent with an expectancy bias explanation for the Study One findings.
Study Two discussion
Participants in Study Two had strong expectations about the various effects of regular micro-
dosing. Participants expected that all of the experiences they were asked to rate would either
increase or decrease in frequency. Most changes found in Study One followed the expected
direction of change in Study Two (i.e., decreased depression, decreased stress, decreased mind
wandering, and increased absorption). The only direct contradiction between expected and
actual effects of microdosing was that participants in Study Two expected that neuroticism
would decrease following microdosing, whereas a small but significant increase was found in
Study One.
Participants in Study Two did have many predictions that, although not directly contra-
dicted were not supported by the evidence from Study One. Participants in Study Two
expected all measures would change following microdosing but that is not what we found. In
particular, participants in Study Two had very strong predictions that creativity, wellbeing,
and mindfulness would increase (weighted expectation scores all > .90), but none of these
measures showed significant increases in Study One. Overall there was no evidence of an asso-
ciation between participants’ expectations about which variables would change due to micro-
dosing in Study Two and the effects of microdosing found in Study One.
General discussion
This was exploratory research that investigated people’s experience of and attitudes toward
microdosing. Study One showed that, in the short term, microdosing led to an immediate
A systematic study of microdosing

February 6, 2019
18 / 26
 boost across a range of psychological variables but that these effects were (mostly) not sus-
tained over multiple days. Longer term, we found evidence that microdosing led to improved
mental health, altered attentional capacities (reduced mind wandering and increased absorp-
tion), and increased neuroticism.
Study Two showed that amongst people who are interested in microdosing there are
strongly held beliefs that microdosing can impact a wide range of psychological variables. A
substantial majority of media reports on microdosing present the practice in glowing and posi-
tive terms. This may have led to a perception of microdosing as a general panacea that is able
to improve virtually all aspects of an individual’s life. It is not clear the degree to which these
expectations influence individuals’ interpretation and reports of their microdosing
experiences.
Taken together these findings paint an intriguing picture. We found clear changes in a
small set of psychological variables: decreased depression and stress; decreased mind wander-
ing; increased absorption; and increased neuroticism. Notably, these variables were not those
that participants most expected to change. If the current findings were entirely due to expecta-
tion, then we should have seen changes in those variables that are most commonly discussed
in media and online accounts of microdosing, and in those variables rated highest in Study
Two. In fact several of the most commonly discussed effects of microdosing and the effects
most expected to change (creativity, wellbeing, mindfulness) showed no evidence of alteration
whatsoever. This suggests that the longer term changes we identified were unlikely to be due to
expectation.
On the other hand, although we did identify clear short term changes following each micro-
dose in the daily analyses, the longer term changes identified in Study One were unrelated to
the total number of doses participants ingested during the study period and also unrelated to
participants’ prior microdosing experiences. This surprising lack of a relationship between the
overall quantity of microdoses and the degree of subjective effects is a reason to interpret these
findings cautiously. At face value this suggests that any engagement with microdosing, whether
a single dose or relatively frequent dosing, can impact the variables we identified. This may be
the case, but it is also possible that participants’ self reports of dosage and frequency in this
study were not precise enough to accurately characterise dose related effects.
Overall, these findings suggest several disconnects between the popular narrative around
microdosing and the experience of microdosers in this sample. Participants in Study One
microdosed less often than is recommended in most online protocols and did not report that
many of the immediate effects of microdosing lasted beyond the day of dosing. Although pop-
ular accounts of microdosing describe sustained boosts in productivity and creativity [16–18],
the longer term effects we identified mainly involved reduced mental distress and changes in
constructs such as absorption and mind wandering that are not as commonly discussed. This
suggests that microdosing may lead to more subtle changes characterised by improvements in
mental stability, the capacity to sustain attention and increased ability to become engaged in
intense imaginative experiences.
The most surprising finding was that neuroticism also appeared to increase following
microdosing. This is not something that is discussed in popular accounts of microdosing and
was not what participants expected in Study Two. This highlights an important and under dis-
cussed aspect of microdosing: not everyone has a positive experience. Although the majority of
participants’ comments were positive (and even glowing), there were a subset of comments
that reflected unease about microdosing (see Table 5). In a context of considerable hype
around the practice of microdosing, particularly with regards to it’s potential as a business
tool, it important to acknowledge that microdosing may not be universally beneficial. These
findings highlight the need for further research into the full range of microdosing effects

 (positive and negative) and also for investigations into subtypes of individuals who may partic-
ularly benefit from or be adverse to the practice.
Strengths, limitations and future directions
This was very much a preliminary and exploratory study of microdosing, and there are clear
limitations to the study design. This was a self reported observational study and as such, we
relied on participants’ accuracy and honesty in their reports of doses and effects, and also on
their continued responsiveness throughout the study period. Recruitment for this study
occurred through online forums that were mainly very positive about the effects of microdos-
ing. As such, these results may be affected by sampling bias, and may under represent individ-
uals with negative or ambivalent experiences of microdosing. Furthermore, as might be
expected in an observational study of individuals who are interested in psychedelics, there was
some concurrent use of higher dose psychoactive substances and non psychedelic substances
that may have had some influence on these results. A better design would certainly be to con-
duct an experimental study with controlled doses of known substances and a placebo compari-
son condition. The legal and bureaucratic limitations around psychedelic research make the
approval process for such a study prohibitive. As an alternative, in implementing the current
design we aimed to demonstrate that it is possible to investigate the effects of psychedelic sub-
stances in a systematic observational paradigm, using an automated and anonymous commu-
nication system.
This study involved investigation of a wide range of psychological variables. We limited the
likelihood of obtaining false positive results in two ways. First, in our long term analyses we
minimised the number of subscales investigated by using only a total or mean summary score
wherever practical. For example, the Tellegen Absorption Scale has six subscale scores but we
analysed only the total absorption score. Second, in all of our analyses we used conservative
adjustments to account for multiple comparisons within each domain. We acknowledge that
we cannot draw strong conclusions from these exploratory findings but suggest that the effects
identified are worthy of further investigation in future confirmatory research with specific
hypotheses. In particular, it will be important to untangle the role of expectation, either by
implementing a placebo condition or by investigating the direct influence of expectations on
individuals’ subsequent microdosing experiences. Future research also needs to focus on better
understanding the impacts of frequency and dosage.
It is clear from this research that there is a high level of popular interest in microdosing,
that many people are engaged in this practice, and that there are strong expectations about the
various effects that microdosing can have. The current findings suggest that popular accounts
of the effects of microdosing may not match the experience of long term microdosers, and that
promising avenues for future investigation are the impacts of microdosing on improved men-
tal health, attentional capabilities, and neuroticism.
