Abstract
Background: To assess the worldwide variation of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in-
cidence, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based data
published to date.
Methods: We reviewed Medline and Embase up to June 2015 and included all population-
based studies of newly diagnosed ALS cases, using multiple sources for case ascertain-
ment. ALS crude and standardized incidence (on age and sex using the US 2010 popula-
tion) were calculated. Random effect meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed
using the subcontinent as the main study level covariate. Sources of heterogeneity related
to the characteristics of the study population and the study methodology were investigated.
Results: Among 3216 records, 44 studies were selected, covering 45 geographical areas
in 11 sub-continents. A total of 13 146 ALS cases and 825 million person-years of follow-
up (PYFU) were co-nsidered. The overall pooled worldwide crude ALS incidence was at
1.75 (1.55–1.96)/100 000 PYFU; 1.68 (1.50–1.85)/100 000 PYFU after standardization.
Heterogeneity was identified in ALS standardized incidence between North Europe [1.89
(1.46–2.32)/100 000 PYFU] and East Asia [0.83 (0.42–1.24)/100 000 PYFU, China and Japan
P ¼ 0.001] or South Asia [0.73 (0.58–0.89)/100 000/PYFU Iran, P ¼ 0.02]. Conversely,
homogeneous rates have been reported in populations from Europe, North America and

Conclusion: This review confirms a heterogeneous distribution worldwide of ALS, and
sets the scene to sustain a collaborative study involving a wide international consortium
to investigate the link between ancestry, environment and ALS incidence.

Introduction
Variation in the incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS) between geographical areas could support the notion
that genetic factors, especially populations’ ancestries,
along with environmental and lifestyle factors, play a dom-
inant role in the occurrence of the disease.
In 2007, a systematic review argued for a uniform oc-
currence of ALS across populations of European origin
and, by contrast, a lower incidence of ALS among popula-
tions of African, Asian and Amerindian origin.1 It was
nevertheless difficult to draw firm conclusions, as there
was methodological heterogeneity among studies in non-
European populations. Also, both the population-based
and the clinic-based studies were lumped together, render-
ing conclusions even more challenging. These results were
consistent with those of a subsequent systematic review.2
Since then, numerous new incidence or mortality data
have been reported from various parts of the world.3–14 In
addition, considering that in some settings ALS mortality
rates can be considered as valid proxy for ALS inci-
dence rates,15 lower mortality rates of ALS in a mixed
population in Cuba raised the hypothesis that a much
wider variety of and different combinations of at-risk al-
leles lower the overall risk of developing the disease.16
Finally, no formal meta-analyses of ALS incidence have
been performed.
An analysis of worldwide incidence rates may provide
new clues into the role of ancestry and environment in the
occurrence of ALS. We performed a systematic review and
meta-analysis of published data concerning the incidence
of ALS in relation to subcontinents.
Methods
We
applied
the
guidelines
for
Meta-Analyses
and
Systematic Reviews of Observational Studies (MOOSE)17
and followed other specific recommendations for system-
atic reviews and meta-analyses.18 As this review of litera-
ture/meta-analysis did not include ALS patients but only
publications on ALS, informed consent of patients was not
applicable. Approval of an ethics committee was not
applicable.
Definitions
In this study, the disease under consideration was motor
neurone disease (MND), which includes ALS and ALS sub-
types.19 We included only population-based studies. A
population-based study implies using an appropriate meth-
odology, an epidemiological investigation of a sample or
the entire population, within defined geographical and
time
boundaries.20

Key Messages
• Variation of ALS incidence between subcontinents might be related to population ancestries.
• Homogeneous incidence rates have been reported in populations from Europe, North America and New Zealand
(pooled ALS standardized incidence: 1.81 (1.66-1.97)/100 000 PYFU
• Differences were identified in ALS standardized incidence between North Europe [1.89 (1.46-2.32)/100 000 PYFU] and
East Asia [0.83 (0.42-1.24)/100 000 PYFU, China and Japan, P ¼ 0.001] and South Asia [0.73 (0.58-0.89)/100 000/PYFU,
Iran, P ¼ 0.02].
• It is not possible in our study to disentangle the real impact of ancestral origin from lifestyle or environmental
factors.
• An international consortium to perform, with homogeneous methodology, an investigation of the link between ances-
try, environment and ALS, is needed.

 heterogeneity of ALS incidence, we considered sub-contin-
ent as our main study-level covariate. Sub-continent classi-
fication was based on the United Nations Statistics
Division.21
Search strategy
Medline and Embase were searched. Period of publication
(until June 2015) and language were unlimited. We did not
use filters as regards species or type of article. Keywords,
defined with a medical librarian, are described in eTable 1
(available as Supplementary data at IJE online). We also
performed hand-searching (reference lists of articles). All
references identified were imported into Endnote X7 and
duplicates were deleted.
Inclusion criteria
Systematic reviews were not included but their references
were examined. Proceedings of conferences were not
included. We included population-based studies of newly
diagnosed ALS cases, using multiple types of sources to en-
sure the highest level of completeness for case ascertain-
ment: (i) ALS referral centres; (ii) hospital discharge data;
(iii) neurologists; (iv) other specialists; (v) health insurance
data; (vi) death certificates; (vii) patients’ associations; and
(viii) primary care physicians. For each study, the number
and type of sources were collected. Appropriate method-
ology was mandatory in terms of definition of the geo-
graphical coverage, study population, investigated period
and diagnostic criteria for ALS cases. Only studies with a
neurological confirmation of the diagnosis were included.
All population-based studies of newly diagnosed ALS
cases were included; nevertheless: (i) when more than one
article was available for the same geographical area, the
one with the longest follow-up and most person-years was
prioritized; (ii) in case of overlap of geographical areas, the
article with the widest geographical coverage was priori-
tized; (iii) and studies from historical ALS foci (Guam
ALS-PDC focus and Wakayama prefecture) were not
included in order to avoid gathering ALS with variants un-
related to sporadic ALS and potentially implying differing
aetiological mechanisms such as toxic exposures, specific
nutritional habits and food and water supplies associated
with toxins.22 Full texts were examined by one author,
who assessed their eligibility. Decision about inclusion was
confirmed by a second author.
Data extraction from included studies
During the collection of data from articles included in the re-
view, we did not calculate a ‘quality score’ as its use has been
criticized for being inaccurate in some cases.18 Instead we
used a checklist, whose components are described below,
based on the basic principles of descriptive epidemiology and
focused on all aspects of the study design that can influence
the quality of case ascertainment and results. The following
data were recorded: investigators, year of publication,
period, location, design, sources of case ascertainment, diag-
nosis criteria, number of patients (male, female), population
understudy (male, female, age structure) and number of cases
by age group and sex. Where not available in the published
material, authors (or their collaborators) were contacted in
order to obtain more information regarding the variables
included in the review. When the attempt to contact the au-
thor failed and the article displayed age and sex-specific inci-
dence in a figure, we performed a graphical reading of the
figure to obtain numerical rates. For each geographical area,
life expectancy at 50 years for men and for women was
retrieved from the demographic yearbook published by the
United Nations at the mid point of the study period.23 For
Libya, we used Egypt life expectancy as proxy due to missing
data, and for Hawaii, data were extracted from the United
States Census Bureau.24 With the help of a geographer, we
accurately identified the geographical area for each study.
We collected Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates of
the areas in order to create worldwide maps of crude and
standardized incidence.
Data analysis
Crude incidence [number of cases per 100 000 person-years
of follow-up (PYFU)] was re-calculated based on number of
ALS cases, duration of case ascertainment and study popula-
tion extracted from each article. Direct standardizations
were performed on age and sex on the US 2010 popula-
tions.25,26 This reference population was chosen for congru-
ence with usual practices in this field because this is the most
frequently used standard population in ALS. To allow homo-
geneity of reports, we did not exclude any part of the popula-
tion (when authors considered only subjects older than 15 or
18 years of age, we re-included the youngest subjects in the
population under study); 95% confidence intervals (95% CI)
were calculated based on the Poisson distribution.
Meta-analysis was conducted and forest plots were ob-
tained.27 Stratification by subcontinents was performed.
Pooled incidence rates were calculated. Weights were
based on the precision of the incidence estimates for each
study, i.e. the inverse of their standard error assuming a
Poisson distribution. The I2 value was also calculated.28
Because the heterogeneity was statistically significant, ran-
dom effects models were used.
Random effects meta-regression with the DerSimonian
and Laird method29,30 was used to assess sources of

 heterogeneity. We used sub-continents as the study level
covariate candidate to be the most important source of het-
erogeneity. The referent sub-continent was the one with the
highest number of articles. We considered the following
study level covariates as further sources of heterogeneity: (i)
characteristics of the study population—life expectancy
after 50 years in men and women and sex-ratio (SR) of the
study population; and (ii) methods—study design (prospect-
ive/retrospective), diagnostic criteria [clinical assessment vs
El Escorial original (EEDC)31 or revised (EEDC-R) classifi-
cation],32 duration of the study period, number of PYFU
and period of study. Bubble plots were produced for con-
tinuous study-level covariates. R-squared of the models
were given. Analyses were done using the statistical soft-
ware Stata v11.1 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX,
USA).
Results
Included studies
Of 3254 articles identified in the literature search, 70 were
duplicates. After screening (title, abstract), 291 full-text
articles were considered. After a comprehensive examin-
ation of the full texts, 44 articleswere finally included, cov-
ering 45 geographical areas and 11 sub-continents3,4,6,8–
14,33–36 (Figure 1, Table 1). Types of sources used for case
ascertainment are given for each included study; 40 other
papers were considered as duplicate material because they
described an investigation performed in the same popula-
tion or in a subset of a population already included.67–106
Reasons for non-inclusion of articles are described in the
flowchart (Figure 1).
Geographical coverage
Of the 45 geographical areas investigated (Figure 2), 24
(53.3%) were from Europe: [11 in North Europe, 4 in
West Europe, 9 in South Europe (8 from Italy)], and 14
(31.1%) from the American continent: 10 in North
America (Canada and the USA), 2 in South America
(Uruguay and Argentina), 1 in Hawaii and 1 in the
Caribbean (Guadeloupe Island). East Asia was represented
by three studies (6.6%). South Asia was represented by
only
one
study

Crude incidence
A total of 13 146 ALS cases and 825 million PYFU were con-
sidered. The overall pooled worldwide crude incidence of
ALS was at 1.75 (1.55-1.96)/100 000 PYFU (Figure 3, Table
2), 2.03 (1.79-2.37) in men and 1.45 (1.25-1.64) in women.
Whereas pooled incidence from European sub-continents
ranged from 1.92 (1.49-2.34) in North Europe, number of
studies ¼ 11) to 2.22 (1.72-2.73) in South Europe (n ¼ 9)
and 2.35 (1.79-2.92) in West Europe (n ¼ 4) per 100 000
PYFU, incidence was at 1.59 (1.32-1.87) for North America
(n ¼ 10) and 0.78 (0.50-1.05) for East Asia (n ¼ 3).
Incidence rates from studies performed in South America var-
ied between 1.37 and 3.17/100 000 PYFU, leading to a
pooled estimate of 2.19 (0.44-3.94)/100,000 PYFU. Among
studies from the Caribbean (Guadeloupe Island), North
Africa (Libya), West Asia (Israel) and South Asia (Iran), ALS
incidence appeared remarkably low [1.02 (0.76-1.27), 0.89
(0.52-1.25), 0.66 (0.58-0.74) and 0.43 (0.34-0.52), respect-
ively]. Pooled crude incidence for populations of European
origin (Europe, North America and New Zealand) was at
1.96 (1.76-2.17)/100 000. There was heterogeneity in ALS
crude incidence (Table 2, first column) in East Asia, South
Asia (Iran) and Israel as compared with North Europe (P ¼
0.006, 0.02 and 0.049, respectively).

 Age- and sex-standardized incidence
We were able to perform a standardization of ALS incidence
rates on US 2010 population for 42 geographical areas: for
41 areas on age and sex3,4,6,8–14,22,33–64,66–101,107–111 and,
on age only, in one area.65 For the three remaining areas
(Swabia, Lancashire, Hawaii) this was not possible; in these
latter cases, we did not have access to the number of ALS
cases by age and sex groups.9,39,60 Number of cases or
incidence rates of ALS by sex and age groups were available
(present in the article or in supplementary material or pro-
vided on request by authors) for 36 areas.6,8,11–14,35–38,40–
51,54–58,61,63,63,66,100,108,112 For the remaining six articles, a

performed to obtain rates.4,33,35,52,53,59 The demographic

 additional studies the number of subjects for the youngest
age groups (0-18) was re-calculated based on national cen-
sus data.3,42,51,66 For the other studies (n ¼ 12), the
structure of the population under study was retrieved from
national demographic databases.4,33–36,52–54,56,59,62,63
The pooled worldwide US 2010-standardized incidence of
ALS was 1.68 (1.50-1.85)/100 000 PYFU (Figure 4, Table 2),
1.96 (1.75-2.18) for men and 1.39 (1.21-1.56) for women,
giving a standardized sex ratio of 1.41. As compared with
crude incidence, standardization on the US population
reduced the pooled estimates for Europe [1.89 (1.46-2.32),
1.71 (1.33-2.10) and 1.75 (1.44-2.06)/100000 PYFU, re-
spectively in North, South and West Europe]. Conversely,
there was an increase in the point estimates and pooled
estimates for North America [1.79 (1.56-2.01)], Oceania
[New-Zealand: 2.56 (2.22-2.90)], North Africa [Libya: 2.03
(1.16-2.91)], East Asia [0.83 (0.42-1.24)], South Asia [Iran:
0.73 (0.58-0.89)] and the Caribbean [Guadeloupe Island:
1.15 (0.86-1.45)]. The point estimate of standardized inci-
dence in Southern America was at 1.59 (1.30-1.88)/100 000
PYFU and there was no heterogeneity between the two
studies published in this area (P ¼ 0.41). We identified het-
erogeneity in standardized ALS incidence in East Asia
and South Asia as compared with North Europe (P-value
0.001 and 0.02, respectively). Pooled ALS standardized inci-
dence for populations of European origin (Europe, North
America and New Zealand) was at 1.81 (1.66-1.97)/100 000
PYFU.

 Robustness analysis
An additional analysis was performed to explore sources
of heterogeneity related to (i) the characteristics of the
study population and (ii) the study methodology.
Crude incidence.
Using univariable meta-regression, we identified hetero-
geneity (P ¼ 0.018) in ALS crude incidence between stud-
ies that used El Escorial criteria (original or revised
version) for case definition [incidence estimate: 1.93 (1.65-
2.20)/100 000 PYFU] as compared with the neurologist’s
overall judgment [incidence estimate: 1.29 (1.09-1.49)].
Heterogeneity
was
also
identified
depending
on
the
time period of the study, with higher crude incidence
rates for a more recent period of investigation (Table 2,
eFigure 1). An ‘association’ between crude incidence
and life expectancy after 50 years in women (P ¼ 0.005)
was identified (eFigure 1 presents the bubble plots of
these relations, available as Supplementary data at IJE
online).
Standardized incidence.
We did not identify any heterogeneity in standardized
incidence
in
relation
to
(i)
characteristics
of
the
study population or (ii) study methodology. Specifically,
we did not identify relevant time trends in standardized
ALS incidence after controlling for age and sex (eFigure
2, P ¼ 0.95, available as Supplementary data at IJE
online).
Discussion
This review is the first to report pooled estimates of ALS
crude and USA-standardized incidence of worldwide popu-
lation-based studies. It emphasizes the heterogeneity be-
tween European ALS incidence and incidence from East
Asia (China, Japan), South Asia (Iran) and West Asia
(Israel). Conversely, there is homogeneity in incidence
among populations from Europe, North America and New
Zealand.
Input of mixed populations
It is not possible in our study to disentangle the real impact
of ancestral origin from lifestyle or environmental factors,
because they are highly associated. In this regard, data
from mixed populations might give useful information.
Such studies allow comparison of incidence rates between
different population subgroups that share, at least par-
tially, the same environment. Table 3 presents ALS inci-
dence data estimated in mixed populations (England,104
USA,55,56,113 Hawaii60 Israel,65 ) or estimated with homo-
geneous methods in different geographical areas (USA,
Japan62).
A recent initiative, using a population-based design,
investigated the racial variations in ALS incidence in three
states (Florida, New Jersey and Texas) and eight metropol-
itan areas (Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Las
Vegas, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and San Francisco) of the
USA.113,114 Based on 3819 incident cases identified during
the study period (2009-11), higher crude and standardized
ALS incidences were found in Whites (USA-standardized
incidence 1.48/100 000 PYFU) as compared with African
Americans (0.89) and with Asians (0.78). Based on ethnic
data, a difference was identified between non-Hispanics
(1.36) and Hispanics (0.84). These data are in agreement
with most previous reports on this topic, which showed in
the USA and in the UK a constantly lower point estimate in
non-Whites as compared with Whites.55,56,104 The consist-
ency of the findings would exclude under-ascertainment of
cases as a possible explanation of the differences. Also, a
lower access to health systems for some minorities with
lower socioeconomic status in the USA needs to be dis-
cussed; Whites have traditionally a better access to health
care.115 In this regard in the USA, ALS Asians are less
likely to have a federal payer (e.g. 55.2%) as compared
with White and African Americans (63.3% and 65.2%, re-
spectively).113 The use of self-pay was also higher in
Asians.
Within a given population, a difference in life expect-
ancy between races or ethnic groups might also be impli-
cated in differences of ALS rates. Indeed, a higher
number of old people in some groups (the pool of subjects
most likely to develop ALS) will lead to higher rates if
these
are
not
standardized
on
race/ethnicity.
For
example, Chang et al. showed that healthy life expectancy
in non-Hispanic Whites was 2.6 years higher than in
Hispanics and 7.8 years higher than in non-Hispanic
Blacks.116
In our review, it was not possible to accurately assess
ALS incidence in Africa due to lack of data. Crude inci-
dence in Libya (North Africa) was low [0.89 (0.52-1.25)/
100 000], but after adjustment [2.03 (1.16-2.91)/100 000]
it was in the same range as data from Europe or North
America. Other data from the African continent are needed
to understand more about ALS in this continent.117 Our re-
sults comparing incidence data from Europe and from East
Asia are in favour of a lower incidence in this latter geo-
graphical area. As Eastern Asian studies included in our re-
view are from high-resource areas (Hong Kong, Taiwan,
Japan), an under-ascertainment of ALS cases seems un-
likely. The report by Okumura et al.,62 comparing inci-
dence

 Island (Japan), was also in agreement with ours: i.e. lower
incidence
in
East
Asia
as
compared
with
Western
populations.
Additional clues to disentangle genetic and environmen-
tal factors can come from studies on migrants. Chio
et al. 199979 raised the issue of ALS incidence among mi-
grants
from
South
Italy
who
lived
in
North
Italy.
Authors identified, in comparison with people born in
Piedmont, an increased risk of ALS in migrants from Puglia
(South-East Italy) as well as in men migrating from outside
Italy. This observation was attributed by the authors to an
interaction between environmental and genetic factors or se-
lective migration (people who migrated were of lower
socioeconomic status in their native area and most of them
were farmers: two characteristics supposed to be associated
with an increase in ALS risk).
A clue to a better understanding of ALS incidence
variation
The link between the age structure of the population and
ALS incidence is well known, as age-specific incidence shows
usually a progressive rise with age, with a peak between 65
and 75 years of age followed by a decrease before in men
and then in women.118 We evaluated this link through the
meta-regression of crude incidence, using life expectancy
after 50 years of age as a proxy for the pool of subjects at
risk to develop ALS. This link was identified for crude inci-
dence (P-value 0.005 for life expectancy in women). After
standardization, this association was not confirmed.
In agreement with others,2 we did not identify a correl-
ation between incidence and duration of study, even when
considering the total PYFU. In contrast with others, we did
not identify different incident rates according to the

 modalities of data collection (prospective or retrospective).
Previous reviews identified lower incidence in retrospective
studies.1,2 However, those reviews considered not only
population-based studies with multi-source cases ascertain-
ment but also clinic-based data.
Our data show that, with time, there was an increase in
crude incidence but not in standardized incidence. This
pattern could be explained, at least partially, by the evolu-
tion of the age structure of the populations at risk (which
aged especially in the North American continent and in
Europe in the past 50 years).
A clue for health care organization
An accurate calculation of synthesized indicators of ALS
incidence for various geographical areas allows the estima-
tion of the number of new cases by year with good preci-
sion. As the burden of the disease on
personal, societal
and economic grounds is high, our study can give a better
outline of the needs for research and health care organiza-
tion. Using populations25 and pooled crude incidences esti-
mates, the numbers of incident cases by year are expected
to be around 5500 in the North American continent, 9900
in Europe (summing North, South and West Europe) and
12 300 in East Asia.
Strengths
The main strength of this work relies on the material that
was used (population-based studies using multiple sources
of case ascertainment). The population-based approach
has been consistently shown to be the best suited to de-
scribe the entire spectrum of the ALS incidence and pheno-
type.118,119 The literature search was broad, without
limitations in terms of dates of publication or language,
and exhaustive. The ability to perform systematic stand-
ardization of ALS incidence with such a wide panel of
data, in line with guidelines on meta-analysis of observa-
tional studies17 and recommendations regarding the meta-
analysis of incidence studies in neuroepidemiology,18 is
without antecedents. We assessed the impact of study
methodology and other characteristics (including markers
of study quality, i.e diagnostic method, design) and con-
firmed the robustness of our results.
Limitations
First, as previously mentioned,2 the main body of literature
on ALS epidemiology is large but limited geographically.
This is especially true for population-based investigations.
Most research has been conducted in Europe (53.3% of
studies) or more globally in populations of Caucasian
origin (77.7%, including Europe, North America, New
Zealand).
Second, some methodological requirements chosen dur-
ing the preparation of the study protocol might have influ-
enced our
results. The inclusion in
four cases,
for
homogeneity purposes, of the population aged lower than
15 or 18 years might have diluted the ALS rates.3,42,51,66
The graphical reading of ALS age-specific rates in some
cases4,33,34,52,53,59 might have also influenced the results.
Nevertheless: (i) the number of cases given in the article
and the total number of cases calculated using age-specific
rates were highly concordant and (ii) we were able to verify
an excellent agreement between our graphical reading and
rates that were available in the supplementary web-only
material of one study.42
Third, another important limitation is the variability of
study designs, populations at risk and settings. We did our
best to exclude studies of low quality and we explored
sources of heterogeneity related to the design, diagnostic
method, time period, population size and life expectancy,
and study duration. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the
possibility that some differences are due at least in part to
the lack of comparability of the reports included in this re-
view. Differences in health care system organization and
access to health care could be also implicated. A differen-
tial referral even within the population-based setting can-
not be excluded for some categories, i.e. elderly, women
and minorities.119,120
Fourth, the criteria for the diagnosis of ALS (clinical as-
sessment versus El Escorial criteria), the evolution with
time of El Escorial criteria (original vs revised) and the El
Escorial categories included might be implicated in the het-
erogeneity of ALS incidence. The real impact of these
methodological differences is difficult to estimate. For ex-
ample, studies based on the original EEDC included all cat-
egories of ALS (Definite, Probable, Possible, Suspected),
n ¼ 12,3,39,40,42–45,48,51,53,66 or excluded cases who, during
follow-up, remained suspected ALS (n ¼ 4)4,37,38,54 or sus-
pected/possible ALS (n ¼ 2).6,59 Conversely, most papers
that used the revised version of EEDC included all types of
ALS (Definite, Probable, Probable laboratory supported,
Possible) (n ¼ 13),8–14,46,47,50,57,64 and only one excluded
cases with possible ALS during follow-up (n ¼ 1).121
However, when looking at standardized rates (i.e when
controlling for age and sex distribution of the underlying
population), ALS heterogeneity was not explained by the
diagnosis (P ¼ 0.51). This might suggest that the key driver
is the modification in populations demographics, which is
related to time.
Fifth, ALS rates were standardized on age and sex only,
therefore results are susceptible to unmeasured confound-
ing factors which may vary by subcontinent or country.

 Sixth, it would have been of major interest to perform
subgroup analyses based on ethnic groups. With the excep-
tion of recent data from the US National ALS registry ini-
tiative,113 accurate information on ethnic groups and,
consequently, number of cases by ethnic group among ALS
patients were not given in the original articles.
Seventh, we attempted to consider subcontinent as a
proxy for ancestral origin of the population, but subcontin-
ent does not represent individual population ancestral origin
or ethnicity. Also, within a given subcontinent, the ancestral
origin of subjects is not homogeneous. Human population
groups and level of admixture vary within a given country.
A clue for future research
This work shows the heterogeneity of ALS worldwide inci-
dence between subcontinents. This heterogeneity could be
related
to
the
ancestral
origin
of
the
populations.
Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that some differences are
related to differences in environmental factors in connec-
tion with the growing evidence that aetiology relies on
multifactorial effects resulting from the combination of en-
vironmental and genetic factors.122
As is the case for Alzheimer disease,123,124 ALS pheno-
type and natural history also vary with geographical area.
Marin et al. showed that a major explanatory variable for
the variability of ALS phenotype in population-based stud-
ies is subcontinent.125 Some markers of ALS phenotype
have
homogeneous
distribution
in
Western
countries
(male:female sex ratio, mean age at onset or at time diag-
nosis) but their distributions in other subcontinents are re-
markably different. Other markers (familial ALS, bulbar
onset) present variations in European and in other subcon-
tinents. As a consequence, ALS outcome markedly varies,
with a median survival time since onset ranging from 24
months (North Europe) to 48 months (South Asia).
Considering this important issue, researchers now need
to consider the organization of a wide international con-
sortium to perform with homogeneous methodology an in-
vestigation of the link between ancestry, environment and
ALS incidence and phenotype. Such an initiative might
lead to important advances in the knowledge of the mech-
anisms of ALS.
