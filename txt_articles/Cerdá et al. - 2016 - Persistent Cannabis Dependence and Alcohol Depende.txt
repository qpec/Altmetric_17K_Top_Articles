Abstract
With the increasing legalization of cannabis, understanding the consequences of cannabis use is 
particularly timely. We examined the association between cannabis use and dependence, 
prospectively assessed between ages 18–38, and economic and social problems at age 38. We 
studied participants in the Dunedin Longitudinal Study, a cohort (n=1,037) followed from birth to 
age 38. Study members with regular cannabis use and persistent dependence experienced 
downward socioeconomic mobility, more financial difficulties, workplace problems, and 
relationship conflict in early midlife. Cannabis dependence was not linked to traffic-related 
convictions. Associations were not explained by socioeconomic adversity, childhood 
psychopathology, achievement orientation, or family structure; cannabis-related criminal 
convictions; early onset of cannabis dependence; or comorbid substance dependence. Cannabis 
dependence was associated with more financial difficulties than alcohol dependence; no difference 
was found in risks for other economic or social problems. Cannabis dependence is not associated 
with fewer harmful economic and social problems than alcohol dependence.

The benefit and harm associated with cannabis, the most widely used illegal drug in the 
world, are subject to fierce debate (L Degenhardt & Hall, 2012). Understanding the effects 
of cannabis is particularly timely today, when historical shifts are taking place in cannabis 
policy. In 2013, Uruguay legalized the sale, production, and distribution of cannabis. Four 
U.S. states legalized recreational use of cannabis, the District of Columbia approved a ballot 
initiative legalizing recreational marijuana use that will be subject to Congressional review, 
and 15 more states are considering legalizing recreational marijuana. Perceptions about the 
riskiness of cannabis have also changed: in the U.S., the proportion of adolescents who 
perceive cannabis as risky has decreased to 45% (Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration, 2012).
Aside from the implications that cannabis use may have for physical and mental health 
(Callaghan, Allebeck, & Sidorchuk, 2013; Hall & Degenhardt, 2009; Hancox et al., 2010; 
Lev-Ran et al., 2014; Pletcher et al., 2012; Thomson et al., 2008), long-term, heavy cannabis 
use may be associated with economic and social problems such as unemployment, lost 
productivity, and lower financial stability (J. S. Brook, Lee, Finch, Seltzer, & Brook, 2013; 
L. Degenhardt, Chiu, Sampson, Kessler, & Anthony, 2007; Fergusson & Boden, 2008; 
Schmidt, Weisner, & Wiley, 1998). In addition, cannabis use has been linked to lower 
relationship satisfaction and domestic violence, although evidence is inconsistent (J. S. 
Brook et al., 2013; J. Brook, Whiteman, Finch, & Cohen, 1996; Dornbusch, Lin, Munroe, & 
Bianchi, 1999; Ellickson & McGuigan, 2000; Fergusson & Boden, 2008; Newcomb & 
Bentler, 1988). Cannabis use by drivers has also been associated with increased risk of 
motor vehicle crashes (Li et al., 2012), but lack of control for confounding, particularly by 
concurrent alcohol use, remains a significant concern (Elvik, 2013; Room, Fischer, Hall, 
Lenton, & Reute, 2010).
A key unaddressed element in the debate about the consequences of cannabis relates to the 
relative impact of cannabis versus alcohol on economic and social problems. Experts have 
proposed that heavy alcohol use has more adverse economic and social consequences than 
heavy cannabis use (Babor, 2010; Nutt, King, Phillips, & Independent Scientific Committee 
on Drugs, 2010; The Editorial Board, 2014; van Amsterdam, Opperhuizen, & Koeter, 2010; 
Weissenborn & Nutt, 2012). For example, qualitative comparisons of substances in terms of 
the severity of social effects associated with heavy use, particularly traffic injuries and 
violence, have rated alcohol as more harmful than cannabis use (Babor, 2010). However, 
studies that quantitatively compared the economic and social impact of the two substances in 
the same population offer conflicting evidence: one study reported that the two substances 
had comparable effects on relationships, delinquency and education (Tucker, Ellickson, 
Orlando, Martino, & Klein, 2005), while another found that heavy cannabis-only users had 
worse social problems than heavy alcohol-only users (Patton et al., 2007).

 Evidence about the social and economic consequences of long-term heavy cannabis use 
comes from population-based longitudinal studies, primarily focused on the impact of 
adolescent cannabis use on outcomes. While such studies have established a temporal 
relation between cannabis use and economic and social problems, four key limitations 
remain. First, cannabis use and economic and social problems could share common 
antecedents related to socioeconomic adversity, childhood psychopathology, low 
achievement orientation, and family structure (Macleod et al., 2004). A second limitation is 
the potential for misclassification of cannabis use: most studies relied solely on measures of 
use frequency, which provide no information about the intensity or duration of cannabis use, 
and which could be key determinants of later outcomes. A third limitation relates to the 
illegal nature of cannabis use: it is unclear whether adverse social and economic outcomes 
associated with cannabis use are a result of cannabis use itself, or of being convicted for a 
cannabis-related offense. Fourth, persistence of cannabis use is highly confounded by the 
timing of onset of use – those who are chronic users are also more likely to have started 
early. Fifth, prior studies have not established whether observed associations between 
cannabis use and later social and economic problems are unique to cannabis or are due to 
comorbid hard-drug and alcohol use among cannabis users.
We studied a birth cohort of 947 individuals to test whether persistent cannabis dependence, 
as well as regular cannabis use, prospectively assessed from ages 18–38, are associated with 
downward social-class mobility, financial difficulties, antisocial behavior in the workplace, 
relationship conflict, and traffic convictions. We also compared the relative impact of 
cannabis versus alcohol dependence on the same economic and social problems. With the 
increasing legalization of marijuana, comparing its economic and social impact with that of 
alcohol, the most commonly used, and legal, substance, is of critical policy importance.
Methods
Study participants
Participants are members of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, 
a longitudinal investigation of the health and behavior of a representative birth cohort of 
consecutive births between April 1972 and March 1973 in Dunedin, New Zealand (Poulton, 
Moffitt, Silva, 2015). The cohort of 1,037 children (91% of eligible births; 52% boys) was 
constituted at age 3. The cohort represents the full range of socioeconomic status on NZ’s 
South Island and matches the NZ National Health and Nutrition Survey on adult health 
indicators (e.g., BMI, smoking, GP visits) (Poulton, Hancox, Milne, Baxter, Scott, &Wilson, 
2006). Cohort members are primarily white; approximately 7% self-identify as having any 
non-white ancestry, matching the South Island. Follow-up assessments were conducted at 
ages 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21, 26, 32, and most recently 38, when 95% of the 1,007 living 
study members underwent assessment in 2010–2012.
This report is based on 947 participants (94% of 1,007 Study members still alive) who 
completed at least three of the five adult cannabis assessments from ages 18–38, including 
the age-38 assessment. Study members not currently in a relationship were excluded from 
analyses of relationship conflict (N=81). Homemakers, full-time students and welfare

 recipients (N=161) were excluded from analyses of workplace behavior. (Relationship and 
employment status did not differ across cannabis dependence groups.)
Study measures
Cannabis use, ages 18–38—Past-year cannabis dependence was assessed at ages 18, 
21, 26, 32, and 38 with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (Robins, Cottler, Bucholz, North, 
& Rourke, 1999; updated 2002; Robins, Helzer, Croughan, & Ratcliff, 1981) following 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria (American 
Psychiatric Association, 2000). Prior assessment waves did not measure cannabis 
dependence and regular cannabis use. At the ages 18 and 21 assessments, cannabis 
dependence was diagnosed using DSM-III-R criteria, whereas at the age 26, 32, and 38 
assessments, cannabis dependence was assessed using DSM-IV. Our main exposure, 
persistence of cannabis dependence, was defined as the number of study waves at which a 
Study member met criteria for dependence: (1) never used cannabis at any study wave; (2) 
used cannabis at least once at one or more study waves but never diagnosed; (3) diagnosed at 
one wave; (4) diagnosed at two waves; and (5) diagnosed at three or more waves. In this 
case, persistence is defined as a mix of chronic, relapsing, and recurrent dependence, 
hereafter referred to as “persistent” to be consistent with prior publications of this study 
(Meier et al., 2012; Moffitt, Caspi, et al., 2007; Moffitt, Harrington, et al., 2007).
Since some Study members used cannabis on a regular basis but never met criteria for 
cannabis dependence, we repeated the analyses using persistent regular cannabis use as the 
exposure (ascertained identically at all ages). Persistence of regular cannabis use was 
defined as the number of study waves at which a Study member reported using cannabis four 
or more days/week: (1) never used cannabis; (2) used but never regularly; (3) used regularly 
at one wave; (4) used regularly at two waves; and (5) used regularly at three or more waves 
(Meier et al., 2012).
The Dunedin Study uses past-year reporting to maximize validity and reliability of recall. 
Past research by this and other groups (Moffitt et al., 2010; Takayanagi et al., 2014) has 
found that repeated prospective assessments of psychiatric symptoms provide more accurate 
estimates of lifetime psychiatric disorder rates than cross-sectional studies. The longitudinal 
design may offer the conditions necessary for participants to be forthcoming, since 
participants who have been interviewed repeatedly learn to trust the confidentiality 
guarantee of the study (Moffitt et al., 2010). Dunedin’s prevalence of cannabis dependence 
has been verified by the Christchurch New Zealand longitudinal study (Boden, Fergusson, & 
Horwood, 2006).
A potential consequence of using past-year reports is that individuals could have 
experienced dependence only during a gap between the Study’s five 12-month assessment 
windows and gone uncounted. Our “net” of 1-y assessments at ages 18, 21, 26, 32, and 38 
years captured all but four of the cohort members who reported receiving treatment for a 
drug-use problem between assessment windows. Three of the four were hard-drug and 
alcohol dependent, and the remaining person sought counseling for cannabis use only as part 
of a child custody dispute. As these four cohort members reported cannabis use but not 
dependence, they were classified as “used but never diagnosed” (Meier et al., 2012).

 Alcohol dependence, ages 18–38—Past-year alcohol dependence was assessed at ages 
18, 21, 26, 32, and 38 with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (Robins, Cottler, Bucholz, 
North, & Rourke, 1999; updated 2002; Robins, Helzer, Croughan, & Ratcliff, 1981) 
following Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) IV criteria 
(American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Our main exposure, persistence of alcohol 
dependence, was defined as the number of study waves at which a Study member met 
criteria for dependence: (1) no dependence at any study wave; (2) diagnosed at one wave; (3) 
diagnosed at two waves; and (4) diagnosed at three or more waves (Meier et al., 2013). Since 
only 7% of Study members had never consumed alcohol, Study members who had never 
used alcohol and those who used but were not dependent were combined into one group.
Economic and social problems, age 38—We used measures of social class mobility, 
financial difficulties, antisocial behavior in the workplace, relationship conflict, and traffic 
conviction to characterize economic and social problems at age 38. These measures are 
described below.
Change in social class: Childhood social class was defined as the average of the highest 
occupational status level of either parent across study assessments from the Study member’s 
birth through 15 years (1=unskilled laborer; 6=professional), on New Zealand’s 
occupational rating of the 1970’s (Elley & Irving, 1976). Adulthood social class was 
assigned based on the Study member’s current or most recent occupation at age 38, using 
the same 6-point scale, updated in 2006 (Milne, Byun, & Lee, 2013; report available at: 
http://www.stats.govt.nz/methods/research-papers/nz-socio-economic-index-2006.aspx). 
Examples of occupations in the six categories include: 6 = medical practitioner, legal 
professional; 5 = financial broker, engineering professional, 4 = database administrator, 
electrician; 3 = printing trades worker, personal assistant, 2 = office cashier, floor finisher, 1 
= cleaner, fish filleter. Change scores were computed by subtracting the child social class 
from the adult social class.
Financial difficulties: Measures of financial difficulties included net worth, troubles with 
debt and cash flow, difficulty to pay basic expenses, food insecurity, welfare benefit receipt, 
and credit ratings. Net worth: study members were asked to estimate the value of 10 
different types of personal assets (e.g. rental property, managed funds, home ownership) as 
well to estimate 6 different types of debt value (e.g., mortgage, student loans, credit card 
bills, other unpaid bills). Assets and debts were each summed and net worth was calculated 
by subtracting debts from assets. Net worth was deciled. Troubles with debt and cash flow: 
study members were asked about 8 types of trouble with debt and with cash flow (e.g., being 
turned down for a credit card, defaulting on a credit card payment, missing a bill, mortgage 
or loan payment). The number of troubles was summed (α =0.59). Difficulty to pay basic 
expenses: study members reported whether they had difficulty meeting the costs of 12 basic 
expenses (e.g., rent, mortgage or contribution for keep, bills for things like insurance, phone 
or heating) (α =0.91). Food insecurity: study members were interviewed about food 
insecurity and classified as food secure vs. food insecure using the USDA Household Food 
Security Survey Module short form (http://www.ers.usda.gov/datafiles/
Food_Security_in_the_United_States/Food_Security_Survey_Modules/short2012.pdf)

 (α=0.84)). Welfare benefit receipt: linked New Zealand (NZ) government records (via the 
NZ Ministry of Social Development) were used to determine whether Study members 
received welfare benefits: Unemployed Benefit, Invalids Benefit, Sickness and Emergency 
Benefits, Domestic Purposes Benefit-Sole Parent and Emergency Maintenance Allowance, 
Training Benefit, Emergency Benefit (for those who did not usually meet entitlement 
conditions). Only one benefit could be received at any given time. Credit ratings: 
creditworthiness was assessed by linking to administrative records of Study members’ credit 
scores, acquired from the Veda Company, the largest credit reference agency in New 
Zealand and Australia. The proprietary Veda score is a numerical expression based on an 
analysis of a person’s credit history that represents the creditworthiness of the person.
Antisocial behavior in the workplace: Measures of antisocial behavior in the workplace 
included: interpersonal deviance, productivity deviance, and property deviance (Piquero & 
Moffitt, 2012). Interpersonal deviance: study members reported about 4 forms of 
interpersonal problems in the workplace (e.g. lying to get a job, quitting without notice, 
having conflicts with coworkers) (α =0.52). Productivity deviance: study members reported 
about 9 counterproductive behaviors in the workplace (e.g. taking an additional/longer break 
than acceptable, purposely working slower than one could have) (α =0.59). Property 
deviance: study members reported about 7 forms of property-related deviance (e.g. stealing 
money, reporting working hours or days that did not work) (α =0.33).
Relationship conflict: Measures of relationship conflict included: relationship quality, 
intimate-partner physical abuse, and intimate-partner controlling abuse. Relationship quality: 
included 28 questions about shared activities and interests, balance of power, respect and 
fairness, emotional intimacy and trust, and open communication (α =0.93). Intimate partner 
physical abuse: study members reported about perpetration of and victimization by 13 forms 
of physical abuse in the past year (e.g. slapping, strangling, kicking, hitting) (αs = 0.72 and 
0.84 for perpetration and victimization, respectively). Participants who reported perpetrating 
at least one form of physical abuse were classified as perpetrators; those experiencing at 
least one form of physical abuse were classified as victims (Ehrensaft, Moffitt, & Caspi, 
2004). Intimate partner controlling abuse: study members reported about perpetration of and 
victimization by 12 forms of controlling behavior (e.g. telling a partner he/she could not 
work or study, stopping a partner from seeing family or friends, following or stalking) (αs = 
0.49 and 0.68, respectively). Participants who reported perpetrating at least one form of 
controlling abuse were classified as perpetrators; those experiencing at least one form of 
controlling abuse were classified as victims (Ehrensaft, Langhinrichsen-Rohling, Heyman, 
O’Leary, & Lawrence, 1999).
Traffic convictions: linked New Zealand (NZ) government records (via the NZ Ministry of 
Justice criminal and traffic history database) were used to determine whether Study 
members were convicted of traffic offenses between ages 32–38 years (including excess 
blood alcohol, speeding, driving without a license, causing injury, hit and run).
Because financial difficulties, workplace behavior, and relationship conflict were assessed 
via multiple measures—and to avoid concerns about multiple testing—the primary analyses 
of these three domains were conducted using a summary composite measure of each. A

 confirmatory factor analysis was conducted using full information maximum likelihood 
(FIML) in MPlus 7.11: the three outcome domains were covaried in a single model. This 
allowed us to properly estimate factor scores using a mix of categorical and continuous 
indicators. The three-factor model fit the data well: χ2 (N = 175.63, df = 74, p = 0.0000; 
RMSEA = 0.038 (0.031, 0.045); CFI = 0.976, TLI = 0.971).
Higher factor scores denote more adverse problems; for example, a higher factor score for 
relationship conflict denotes lower relationship quality, more partner physical violence, and 
more partner controlling behavior.
Potential confounders—Although this observational study cannot confirm causation, we 
used covariates to address leading alternative explanations based on theory and a review of 
the literature (Rutter & Academy of Medical Sciences working group, 2007). Analyses 
controlled for sex, ethnicity, social class of origin, family history of substance dependence, 
low childhood self-control, childhood IQ, adolescent psychopathology (depression and 
conduct disorder), and achievement orientation at age 18. These variables were chosen to 
separate out the effect of persistent cannabis dependence from the constellation of risk 
factors that could increase both cannabis dependence and adult economic/social problems. 
Further, to establish an equitable comparison of adult problems, we controlled for 
differences in Study members’ adult family structure (marital status and number of 
children). Table S1 in the online supplement provides measurement details and reports about 
the associations of the control variables with cannabis dependence and economic and social 
problems.
A measure of early (i.e. by age 18) versus late (i.e. ages 21–38) onset of cannabis 
dependence was used to test whether the associations between cannabis dependence and 
later problems were due to earlier onset of cannabis dependence.
Measures of alcohol and hard-drug dependence were used to test whether the observed 
associations between cannabis use and later problems were due to comorbid hard-drug and 
alcohol use among cannabis users. We assessed alcohol dependence at ages 18, 21, 26, 32 
and 38 years, and hard-drug dependence (e.g., heroin, cocaine, amphetamines) at ages 26, 
32, and 38 years. Persistent alcohol dependence was defined as dependence at three or more 
waves, while persistent hard-drug dependence was defined as dependence at two or more 
waves.
Statistical analysis
Our analysis followed five major steps. First, we used linear (in the case of change in social 
class, financial difficulties, workplace behavior, and relationship conflict) or logistic (in the 
case of traffic convictions) regression to test whether persistent cannabis dependence 
predicted each economic/social problem, independent of all aforementioned covariates. 
Second, we tested whether associations between persistent cannabis dependence and midlife 
problems were due to cannabis-related court conviction by restricting our analyses to Study 
members with no history of cannabis-related convictions. Third, we tested whether 
persistent cannabis dependence’s prediction of midlife problems depended on the age of 
onset of cannabis dependence. Fourth, we tested whether associations between persistent

 cannabis dependence and midlife problems were due to comorbid hard-drug and alcohol 
dependence by restricting analyses to Study members with no history of persistent alcohol or 
hard-drug dependence. Fifth, we compared the magnitude of the association of persistent 
cannabis dependence and persistent alcohol dependence with each economic/social problem. 
For this analysis, and to establish comparability between the alcohol and cannabis user 
groups, we compared four groups for each of the two substances: (1) no dependence at any 
study wave; (2) diagnosed at one wave; (3) diagnosed at two waves; and (4) diagnosed at 
three or more waves. We used the “test” command in proc glm to conduct two non-
symmetric tests: (1) testing whether the regression coefficients estimated for cannabis 
dependence were different from the regression coefficients that had been estimated for 
alcohol dependence (H01: βcannabis = βalcohol) and (2) testing whether the regression 
coefficients estimated for alcohol dependence were different from the regression coefficients 
for cannabis dependence (H02: βalcohol = βcannabis). Results were replicated using persistence 
of regular cannabis use as the exposure variable.
Results
Cannabis and economic and social problems
Persistent cannabis users experienced downward social-class mobility (Figure 1A and Figure 
S1 in the online supplement). Study members diagnosed with cannabis dependence at one, 
two, and three or more waves ended up 0.34, 0.40, and 0.79 rungs lower, respectively, than 
their parents at age 38 (on New Zealand’s 6-point occupation scale; standard deviation of the 
social class difference = 1.50), while those who did not use cannabis ended up 0.20 rungs 
higher than their parents at age 38 (Table 1). As a sensitivity test, we restricted our analysis 
to Study members reared in middle-class homes. On average, persistent cannabis users from 
middle-class origins attained lower adult socio-economic status than their parents, even after 
controlling for sex, ethnicity, family substance-dependence history, childhood self-control, 
childhood IQ, history of psychopathology, achievement orientation, and adult family 
structure. Figure 1B shows that 51.7% of formerly middle-class persistent cannabis users 
experienced downward mobility compared to 14.4% of Study members who never used 
cannabis. In contrast, whereas 33.1% of formerly middle-class Study members who never 
used cannabis experienced upward mobility, only 6.9% of persistent cannabis users did so.
Persistent cannabis users experienced more financial difficulties, engaged in more antisocial 
behavior in the workplace, and reported more relationship conflict (Table 1). Persistent 
cannabis dependence was fairly uniformly associated with multiple economic and social 
difficulties, rather than with any specific difficulty (tables with results available at 
moffittcaspi.com).
Results of analyses for persistent cannabis dependence and persistent regular use were 
similar (see Table S2 in the online supplement).
Associations between persistent cannabis dependence and social and economic problems 
remained statistically significant after controlling for potential confounders with one 
exception; the association between persistent cannabis dependence and traffic conviction 
became non-significant (Table 1).

 The association between cannabis dependence and social and economic problems was not 
due to the inclusion of never users in the analysis. Instead, associations between persistent 
cannabis dependence and social and economic problems remained statistically significant 
after removing never users from the sample (see Table S3 in the supplement). Further, we 
found evidence of a linear relationship between levels of cannabis dependence and social 
and economic problems (see Table S4 in the supplement). With the exception of traffic 
convictions, “departure from linearity” tests were not significant, leading us to conclude that 
“variability of the sample means around the best fitting straight line is assumed to represent 
error variability” (Kirk, 1995).
Is the association between persistence of cannabis dependence and economic and social 
problems due to criminal conviction of cannabis users?
According to the New Zealand Ministry of Justice database, 7.0% of Dunedin Study 
members were convicted of cannabis-related offenses (possession, sale, or cultivation). 
Persistent cannabis users were more likely to be convicted of these offenses (χ2=201.05; df 
= 4; p<0.0001). However, having a conviction record did not account for the association of 
persistent cannabis dependence with downward social mobility, financial difficulties, 
workplace problems, or relationship problems. Even among cannabis users who were never 
convicted for a cannabis offense, persistent cannabis use was significantly linked to these 
economic and social problems (see Table 2).
Is the association between persistence of cannabis dependence and economic and social 
problems due to early onset of cannabis use?
Study members who were persistently dependent on cannabis were more likely to have 
earlier ages of dependence onset (e.g., 61% of those dependent on 3+ waves versus 24.4% of 
those dependent at 1 wave had experienced onset by age 18; χ2=370.33; df= 4; p<0.0001), 
raising the possibility that the findings depended on early onset. To test this premise, we 
estimated crude and adjusted associations between persistence of cannabis dependence and 
midlife problems, controlling for early cannabis dependence onset (i.e. by age 18). Age of 
onset did not account for the association of persistent cannabis dependence with economic 
and social problems (see Table 3).
Is the association between persistence of cannabis dependence and economic and social 
problems due to co-occurrence of persistent alcohol or hard-drug dependence?
Cannabis dependence often co-occurs with dependence on other licit and illicit substances. 
Dunedin Study members who were dependent on cannabis were more likely over the course 
of their lives to be dependent on alcohol than Study members not dependent on cannabis 
(69.9% vs. 26.7%), and the longer Study members were dependent on cannabis, the longer 
they were dependent on alcohol (r = 0.44; p<0.0001). Similarly, Study members who were 
dependent on cannabis were more likely to be dependent on hard drugs than Study members 
not dependent on cannabis (11.6% vs. 0.5%), and the longer they were persistent on 
cannabis, the longer they were dependent on hard drugs (r = 0.23; p<0.0001). Such 
comorbidity raises the possibility that associations observed with cannabis dependence 
actually reflect alcohol or hard-drug effects.

had persistent hard-drug dependence; and (3) excluding Study members who either had 
persistent alcohol or hard-drug dependence (adjusted associations are presented in Table S5 
in the online supplement). In general, excluding cases of persistent alcohol or hard-drug 
dependence had very little impact on the association of cannabis dependence with social 
mobility, financial difficulties, workplace trouble, relationship conflict, and traffic 
convictions.
Comparison of alcohol dependence versus cannabis dependence
At comparable levels of persistence, cannabis and alcohol dependence were similarly linked 
to downward mobility, antisocial behavior in the workplace, relationship conflict, and traffic 
conviction (Table 4). Findings were unchanged after controlling for all potential 
confounders.
The coefficients for cannabis dependence were not different from the coefficients for alcohol 
dependence for the following outcomes: social class (F(1, 935)=1.82; p = 0.18); antisocial 
behavior in the workplace (F(1,783)=0.02; p = 0.88); relationship conflict (F(1,863) = 0.02; 
p =0.90); and traffic convictions (X2(1) = 0.38; p = 0.54). In the same way, the coefficients 
for alcohol dependence were not different from the coefficients for cannabis dependence for 
the following outcomes: social class (F(1,935)=1.33; p = 0.25); antisocial behavior in the 
workplace (F(1,783)=0.01; p = 0.90); relationship conflict (F(1,863) = 0.01; p =0.91); and 
traffic convictions (X2(1) = 0.39; p = 0.53). Cannabis dependence was more strongly linked 
than alcohol dependence to financial difficulties: the coefficient of the association of 
cannabis dependence with financial difficulties was significantly stronger than the 
coefficient of the association of alcohol dependence with financial difficulties (F(1,941) = 
22.92; p<0.0001), and the coefficient of the association of alcohol dependence with financial 
difficulties was weaker than the coefficient of the association of cannabis dependence with 
financial difficulties (F(1,941)=17.64; p<0.0001).
The special case of education
This study focused on adult social and economic outcomes, measured at age 38 years, as a 
function of persistent cannabis use during the years before the outcomes (from ages 18–38 
years). An additional outcome that has been explored in previous studies of the social and 
economic correlates of cannabis use and dependence is educational attainment (Fergusson & 
Boden, 2008; Macleod et al., 2004). However, previous studies have examined the 
association between adolescent cannabis use and adult educational attainment, where the 
temporal order between exposure and outcome is clear. In our study, the temporal relation 
between persistent cannabis use (measured from ages 18 to 38 years) and educational 
attainment is less clear and difficult to sort out, because (a) Study members in our New 
Zealand birth cohort were able to leave school already at age 15 years and (b) Study 
members were able to pursue their education (e.g., going in and out of educational settings) 
throughout the exposure period (between ages 18–38 years). That is, highest educational 
attainment could occur before, during, or after our exposure measure and the temporal

 ordering is very difficult to establish. It is possible that cannabis use interfered with 
education, causing a person to stop education, or it is possible that stopping education freed 
up a person to use cannabis more regularly. Nevertheless, to explore the issue of the 
association between cannabis use and educational attainment, we conducted supplementary 
analyses among a subsample of Study members who completed secondary school 
qualifications. We used logistic regression to test whether persistent cannabis dependence 
predicted completion of a tertiary degree. Among Study members who had completed 
secondary school, persistent cannabis users were less likely to complete a tertiary degree 
than less persistent cannabis users (Table S6 in the supplement).
Discussion
Against the backdrop of increasing legalization of cannabis around the world, and 
decreasing social perception of risk associated with cannabis use (Johnston, O’Malley, 
Bachman, & Schulenberg, 2009; Johnston, O’Malley, Bachman, & Schulenberg, 2010), this 
study provides evidence that many persistent cannabis users experience downward 
socioeconomic mobility and a wide range of associated problems. Individuals with a longer 
history of cannabis dependence (or of regular cannabis use) were more likely to experience 
financial difficulties, including having troubles with debt and cash flow (such as defaulting 
on a credit card payment or missing a loan payment), difficulty paying basic expenses (such 
as food and rent), food insecurity, being on welfare and having a lower consumer credit 
rating. Persistent cannabis dependence (and regular cannabis use) was also associated with 
antisocial behavior in the workplace and higher rates of intimate relationship conflict, 
including physical violence and controlling abuse. The results are consistent with studies 
reporting that cannabis was associated with reduced income and education, increased 
welfare dependence, crime, and lower relationship satisfaction (Arria, Garnier-Dykstra, 
Caldeira, et al., 2013; Arria, Garnier-Dykstra, Cook, et al., 2013; Arseneault, Moffitt, Caspi, 
Taylor, & Silva, 2000; J. S. Brook et al., 2013; J. S. Brook, Zhang, & Brook, 2011; 
Fergusson & Boden, 2008; Horwood et al., 2010; Pedersen, 2011; Schmidt et al., 1998; 
Silins et al., 2014).
The study advances knowledge in five ways. First, our results were robust to control for 
potential sources of confounding present in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, as well 
as to alternative approaches to address confounding, including stratification and statistical 
control for potential confounders. In particular, we ruled out family substance dependence 
history, childhood socioeconomic adversity, childhood low self-control, childhood low IQ, 
adolescent psychopathology and low achievement orientation, plus sex, ethnicity, and adult 
family structure as alternative causal explanations for the observed associations between 
cannabis dependence (and regular cannabis use) and adult economic and social problems. 
Second, contrary to prior claims, the associations were not an artifact of criminal conviction 
of cannabis users, earlier age of onset among the more persistent cannabis users, or their 
dependence on alcohol or hard drugs. Third, we generally observed a dose-response 
contingency: the more years of cannabis dependence (or regular cannabis use), the worse the 
economic and social problems. Fourth, the findings were not due to respondent self-report 
bias: comparable results were obtained for economic and social problems whether measured 
using self-report or administrative record data such as credit ratings, court records, and 
Cerdá et al.

 government social-welfare benefit records. Fifth, the findings were not contingent on 
historically-dependent operational definitions of persistent cannabis dependence/regular use. 
Whereas the definition of ‘cannabis dependence’ changed slightly across the 20-year 
longitudinal-assessment window (because DSM changed), persistence of cannabis use was 
defined in the same way across the 20-year longitudinal assessment window. Yet the results 
were replicated using both ‘cannabis dependence’ and ‘persistence of regular cannabis use’ 
as the exposure.
Cannabis dependence was more strongly linked to financial difficulties than was alcohol 
dependence; it was not associated with less downward mobility, antisocial behavior in the 
workplace, and relationship conflict than alcohol dependence. This finding stands in contrast 
to popular and expert opinion, which states that heavy alcohol use imposes more economic 
and social costs than heavy cannabis use (The Editorial Board, 2014; Weissenborn & Nutt, 
2012). Our results are consistent with the few previous existing studies that compared the 
impact of the two substances, and found comparable (or stronger) economic and social 
effects of cannabis compared to alcohol use (Patton et al., 2007; Tucker et al., 2005). It is 
important to note that our findings are limited to the economic and social problems studied 
here, and thus do not provide any information about the relative association of cannabis and 
alcohol dependence with outcomes such as physical and mental health problems. Further, 
while cannabis and alcohol dependence have comparable effects on economic and social 
problems, the higher prevalence of alcohol dependence in the general population means that 
the population burden posed by alcohol dependence may be greater than that posed by 
cannabis dependence. The burden posed by cannabis use may increase, however, if cannabis 
use increases following legalization of cannabis use.
Study findings should be considered in light of limitations. First, the study took place in a 
setting where cannabis is illegal—the question remains whether the same consequences 
would arise where cannabis is legal. A study in Amsterdam, where cannabis use is quasi-
legal, found that longer duration of cannabis use was associated with lower wages among 
prime-age male workers (van Ours, 2007). Legalization of cannabis in certain U.S. states 
and other countries brings opportunities to test this question. Second, economic and social 
problems were restricted to age 38, the most recent assessment of the Dunedin cohort. 
Future studies should investigate whether adversity persists into older adulthood, a question 
of policy importance because rates of cannabis use by people aged 50 to 64 are rising as the 
baby boom cohort ages (SAMHSA, 2013). Third, the findings are particular to a cohort of 
individuals born in Dunedin, New Zealand, in the 1970s, and may not generalize to groups 
exposed to different social norms regarding cannabis use or a different set of economic and 
social circumstances. The prevalence of cannabis dependence is higher among New 
Zealanders than in other developed nations (Moffitt et al., 2010), but the potency of cannabis 
is comparable across settings (McLaren, Swift, Dillon, & Allsop, 2008). Further, the 
comparability of findings from this study and studies conducted in places as diverse as the 
United States, Europe, and Australia (L. Degenhardt et al., 2007; Dornbusch et al., 1999; 
Fergusson & Boden, 2008; Horwood et al., 2010) suggests that the relationships are not 
context-specific. Fourth, we do not purport to report a causal relationship between cannabis 
dependence and economic/social problems – cannabis dependence could be a marker of a 
life trajectory characterized by social and economic adversity (Macleod et al., 2004).

 Analyses accounted for early life factors such as childhood socioeconomic adversity, family 
substance dependence, adolescent psychopathology, and low achievement orientation, which 
covary with cannabis dependence and adult economic/social problems, allaying this concern 
somewhat. Of importance, any concerns about residual confounding in this study must apply 
to analyses of alcohol, as well as cannabis. Fifth, the label ‘persistent’ in this study describes 
individuals who met diagnostic criteria for substance dependence (in the past 12 months) on 
multiple measurement occasions. The label makes no assumptions about what happened in 
the intervals between the measurement occasions (i.e., remission, relapse); it is simply a 
label to note that the study member was diagnosed on multiple occasions. Sixth, DSM-IIIR 
criteria were used to diagnose dependence at ages 18 and 21, while DSM-IV criteria were 
used at ages 26–38. Our results do not, however, depend on DSM-definitions of dependence 
– we obtained the same results defining the cannabis exposure variable as persistent heavy 
use rather than meeting DSM criteria for cannabis dependence. Seventh, stratification by 
cannabis persistence produced small subgroups of more persistent cannabis users. Three 
factors allay concerns about the use of stratification with small subgroup size. First, we 
show, de facto, that there is enough power to detect an association, and we report 
standardized mean scores to allow readers to assess the magnitude, and not just the statistical 
significance, of the effect. Second, given that this representative birth cohort study of 
children born in Dunedin in 1972–1973 has suffered minimal attrition, the small subgroups 
of persistent users are likely representative of persistent users in the population from which 
they are drawn. Third, reported findings generally show a linear, dose-response relationship, 
and thus do not rely on the patterns observed in a single outlying group of persistent 
cannabis users.
Our data indicate that persistent cannabis users constitute a burden on families, communities 
as well as national social welfare systems. Moreover, heavy cannabis use and dependence 
was not associated with fewer harmful economic and social problems than alcohol 
dependence. Our study underscores the need for prevention and early treatment of 
individuals dependent on cannabis. In light of the decreasing public perceptions of risk 
associated with cannabis use, and the movement to legalize cannabis use, we hope that our 
findings can inform discussions about the potential implications of greater availability and 
use of cannabis.

up in middle class families. Outcomes are the observed proportion of members who 
experienced a decline from childhood middle class origins (classes 3–4) to a lower adult 
social class (classes 1–2), as well as the proportion of members who experienced an increase 
to a higher adult social class (classes 5–6). Findings in this subsample (b = −0.14; S.E. = 
0.07; t = −2.17; p = 0.031) replicated results from the full sample shown in Panel A. Error 
bars = SEs.

3Z-score (M=0; SD=1).
4Restricted to respondents who were currently or formerly employed (n=786)
5Restricted also to Study members currently in a relationship (n=866)
6All statistical tests are t-tests with an independent variable (i.e. number of waves with cannabis dependence) coded 0–5 and with n-1 degrees of freedom, except for traffic convictions, where Wald chi-
square tests with 1 degree of freedom are used. All tests are obtained from regression models.
7Adjusted for sex
8Adjusted for sex, European ancestry, parental socioeconomic status, proportion of first-degree relatives with substance dependence, low childhood self-control, childhood IQ, adolescent psychopathology 
(major depressive disorder and conduct disorder), achievement orientation at age 18, living with partner or spouse at age 38, and number of children at age 38.
9Test statistics and means can be used to calculate effect sizes. From t-tests, effect sizes can be calculated as: r = √[t2/(t2 + df)]. From means, effect sizes can be calculated as: Cohen’s d = M1 – M2 / √ 
[(Standard deviation12 + Standard deviation22)/ 2]. From odds ratios (in the case of traffic convictions), effect sizes can be calculated as ln(OR)/1.81. Please recall that effect sizes can be interpreted as 
small (r=.1 or d=.2), medium (r=.3 or d=.5), and large (r=.5 or d=.8). Effect sizes in this table are presented as “r”.
