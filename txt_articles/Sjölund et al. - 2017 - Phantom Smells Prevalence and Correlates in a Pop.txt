Abstract
Loss of olfactory function is common in old age, but evidence regarding qualitative olfactory 
dysfunction in the general older population is scarce. 
The current study investigates the prevalence 
and correlates of phantom smell experiences (phantosmia) in a population-based study (Swedish 
National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen [SNAC-K]) of Swedish adults (n = 2569) aged 
between 60 and 90 years. Phantosmia was assessed through a standardized interview and defined 
as reporting having experienced an odor percept in the absence of any stimuli in the surrounding 
environment that could emit the odor. The relationships between phantosmia and demographic, 
genetic, health-related, and behavioral variables were analyzed with hierarchical logistic regression 
analyses. The overall prevalence of phantom smells was 4.9%, and was associated with female 
gender, carrying the met allele of the BDNF gene, higher vascular risk burden, and reporting distorted 
smell sensations (parosmia). Olfactory dysfunction was, however, not related to phantosmia. 
The most frequently reported phantom smell was smoky/burnt. A novel finding was that some 
individuals reported phantom smells with an autobiographical connotation. The results from this 
study indicate that the prevalence of phantosmia in the general older population is not negligible 
and that some factors that are beneficial for preserved olfactory function, such as female gender 
and the BDNF met allele, are also associated with the occurrence of phantom smells.

Introduction
Olfactory dysfunction is common, especially among older indi-
viduals. Between 32% and 62% of the older population are esti-
mated to have an impaired sense of smell compared with 6–17% 
in younger age groups (Murphy et al. 2002; Brämerson et al. 2004; 
Landis et al. 2004; Wehling et al. 2011). Olfactory dysfunction sig-
nificantly impacts on quality of life; individuals with an impaired 
sense of smell often report nutritional and interpersonal problems as 
well as negative mood changes and depression (Temmel et al. 2002; 
Hummel and Nordin 2005). Age-related olfactory impairments are 
also associated with cognitive decline and can predict later occur-
rence of dementia in elderly adults (Olofsson et al. 2009; Stanciu 
et al. 2014; Devanand et al. 2015).
Previous research has mainly focused on quantitative olfactory 
dysfunctions in old age, such as reduced olfactory sensitivity and 
identification ability. However, olfactory dysfunctions may also 
involve qualitatively distorted odor sensations such as parosmia 
and phantosmia. Individuals with parosmia experience odors that

 are incongruent with the olfactory environment. Fresh fruit smells 
may, for example, be perceived as rotten. An individual with phan-
tosmia suffers from olfactory “hallucinations,” experiences of odors 
when no odor source is present (Leopold 2002; Frasnelli et al. 2004). 
Qualitative olfactory dysfunctions are in fact often experienced as 
more disturbing than a reduction of smell function because the indi-
vidual is repeatedly reminded of the problem (Leopold 2002). A per-
son with a reduced sense of smell, on the other hand, may remain 
unaware of the olfactory deficit (Mackay-Sim et al. 2006).
Phantosmia has previously been documented in individuals with 
epileptic seizures, schizophrenia, depression, migraine, and otorhino-
laryngology problems (Fuller and Guiloff 1987; Nordin et al. 1996; 
Leopold 2002; Chen et al. 2003; Frasnelli et al. 2004; Landis et al. 
2004; Coleman et al. 2011). The prevalence has been estimated to 
range between 0.8% and 25% depending on the clinical group stud-
ied (Nordin et al. 1996; Landis et al. 2004), yet little is known about 
the prevalence of phantosmia in healthy individuals. One study on 
self-reported chemosensory alterations in a population-based US 
sample of adults 40 years and older found the prevalence of phan-
tosmia to be 6% (Rawal et al. 2016). In another study investigat-
ing the frequency of various hallucinations (olfactory, gustatory, 
visual, auditory, haptic, out-of-body experiences, hypnopompic, and 
hypnagogic) in samples of healthy participants in 3 different coun-
tries, olfactory hallucinations were the most common hallucination, 
reported by 8.6% of the participants, with 3.5% experiencing phan-
tosmia at least once a month (Ohayon 2000).
A related area of research addresses olfactory dreams, which also 
constitute a subjective experience of smell in the absence of actual 
stimulation. In one study, 31.7% of the sample reported having had 
olfactory sensations in a dream (Stevenson and Case 2004). The 
olfactory sensations described were often related to odors frequently 
encountered in the environment such as food, drinks, body odors, 
and odors occurring in nature. A large proportion (21%) of those 
experiencing olfactory sensations in dreams reported odors with a 
“smoky” or “burnt” quality (Stevenson and Case 2004). This is in 
line with the olfactory experiences reported by phantosmic patients. 
Phantom smells are frequently reported to be negative in valence 
and are often described as burnt, foul, unpleasant, spoiled, or rotten 
(Leopold 2002; Chen et al. 2003; Velakoulis 2006; Coleman et al. 
2011), although neutral and positive phantom smells have also been 
reported (Acharya et al. 1998).
Olfactory hallucinations and phantosmias are reported more 
often by women than men (Ohayon 2000; Leopold 2002). Typically, 
the first episode occurs between the ages of 15 and 30 years, lasts 
for about 5–20 min and resolves spontaneously with no lingering 
effects. Also, evidence indicates that the hallucinations often become 
gradually more frequent and persistent following the year of onset 
(Leopold 2002).
Phantosmia occurs in a variety of clinical conditions, and its 
causes are yet unknown. Prior accounts have suggested that the 
phantosmic sensations originate either in the peripheral olfactory 
nervous system or in central brain regions (Stevenson and Langdon 
2012), such as the amygdala (Acharya et al. 1998; Chen et al. 2003) 
and the orbital frontal cortex (Arguedas et al. 2012). A recent 
study showed that patients who experienced phantosmia following 
head trauma were characterized by left frontal atrophy, suggestive 
of a cortical origin (Lötsch et al. 2016). However, a patient study 
reported successfully resolving phantosmia in 7 out of 8 patients 
through excision of the olfactory epithelium, suggesting also periph-
eral olfactory system involvement (Leopold et al. 2002). It is thus 
likely that phantosmias may originate from disruptions in the func-
tional interactions of central and peripheral olfactory circuits.
Although aging is associated with diminished olfactory func-
tion (Brämerson et al. 2004; Landis et al. 2004; Larsson et al. 2004; 
Mackay-Sim et al. 2006), little is known about the role of aging 
in the occurrence of phantosmia or whether phantosmia is related 
to any of the variables that are typically associated with olfactory 
impairments. Genetic variation is one factor that may modulate 
olfactory ability. For example, Hedner et al. (2010) reported that car-
riers of the BDNF val allele exhibited a higher age-related olfactory 
decline compared with met allele carriers, perhaps due to the gene’s 
role in neural plasticity (Poo 2001). Further, the apolipoprotein E 
(APOE) ε4 allele has been linked to olfactory deficits in older adults 
(Olofsson et al. 2010; Larsson et al. 2016; Olofsson et al. 2016). 
Olfactory impairments have also been associated with a number of 
other demographic, clinical, and behavioral variables (Murphy et al. 
2002; Brämerson et al. 2004; Mackay-Sim et al. 2006). As phantos-
mia might be related to impaired olfaction (Frasnelli et al. 2004), it 
is important to further investigate variables that are known to play a 
role in old-age olfactory dysfunction and whether these may account 
for phantosmia.
The primary aim of this study was thus to investigate the preva-
lence of phantosmia in the general older population, and how phan-
tosmia correlates with demographic, genetic, clinical, behavioral, 
olfactory, and cognitive variables. Furthermore, the qualitative (type 
of odor) and quantitative (e.g., duration, frequency) features of 
phantosmia in old age were examined.
Materials and methods
Participants
Participants were derived from the population-based longitudi-
nal Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen 
(SNAC-K). This study originally recruited 3363 randomly selected 
residents of the area of Kungsholmen in central Stockholm, Sweden, 
belonging to predefined age cohorts (60, 66, 72, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 
93, 96, and 99 years or older). They took part in extensive baseline 
assessments of medical, psychological, and social factors. A sub-
group of 2848 participants underwent cognitive assessment (Laukka 
et al. 2013), which included an interview on olfactory functions and 
an olfactory testing protocol. For the present study, 77 participants 
who did not respond to the questions regarding phantosmia were 
excluded. In addition, individuals with dementia (n = 81), Parkinson’s 
disease (n = 21), and developmental disorder (n = 1), as well as indi-
viduals above 90 years of age (n = 79) or scoring < 24 (n = 20) on 
the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were excluded (see 
Figure 1). The final study sample included 2569 participants (61.6% 
women, mean age = 72.05 years, SD = 9.52). The SNAC-K study 
has been approved by the ethical committee at Karolinska Institutet. 
All participants provided written informed consent, and the study 
was performed in accordance with the ethical standards stated in the 
1964 Declaration of Helsinki.
Assessment of phantosmia
Subjective assessments of olfactory abilities were acquired through 
a modified version of a standardized interview (Nordin et al. 2004), 
including questions regarding different olfactory functions and dys-
functions. Phantosmia was defined to the participants as an odor 
percept in the absence of any stimuli in the surrounding environ-
ment that could emit the odor. Specifically, phantosmia was assessed 
by the question “Have you in the last year experienced so called 
phantom smells?”. The question was answered on a 5-point Likert-
type scale, where 0 = “Never” and 4 = “Always.” Participants were 
grouped as phantosmic (1–4) and nonphantosmic (0 = never).

 In instances where a participant reported phantosmia, follow-up 
questions regarding the quality of the phantom smell were asked. 
The participants were first asked to indicate what type of phantom 
smell they had experienced. Seven predefined types of smells were 
provided: infected tissue, smoke, feces, rotten, musk, mold, and 
metallic. The participants could also generate their own label if the 
phantom smell did not match any of the predefined alternatives. 
They were allowed to select several categories if they had experi-
enced more than one type of phantom smell. The answers generated 
by the participants were later grouped into 11 additional categories, 
consisting of similar responses. The grouping was conducted by 2 
experts and was then compared and revised until a consensus was 
reached.
Another follow-up question addressed the intensity of the 
phantom smell (“How strong is the phantom smell?”). The partici-
pants indicated whether the phantom smell was perceived as faint, 
medium, or strong. They were also asked to assess for how long 
they had experienced the phantom smell (0 = “less than a year,” 
1 = “1–3 years,” 2 = “4–5 years,” 3 = “6–10 years,” 4 = “more 
than 10 years,” and 5 = “whole life”) and how often the phantom 
smell appeared (0 = “every month,” 1 = “every week,” 2 = “daily,” 
3 = “always,” and 4 = “other”). The duration of the phantom smell 
was assessed by the question “How long does the phantom smell 
last?” (0 = “fleeting,” 1 = “a few minutes,” 2 = “a few hours,” and 
3 = “all day”). Finally, the participants were asked to specify when 
the phantom smell last occurred (0 = “more than 6 months ago,” 
1 = “1–6 months ago,” 2 = “2–4 weeks ago,” 3 = “in the last few 
days,” or 4 = “it is present right now”).
Correlates of phantosmia
Demographic variables
Demographic variables included age, gender, and educational 
background. Age was dichotomized into 2 age groups; young-old 
(<75 years) and old-old (≥75 years). Educational background was 
measured as the number of years of formal schooling and was dichot-
omized into higher (≥12 years) and lower (<12 years) education.
Genetic variables
Genotyping was conducted via DNA extraction from peripheral 
blood samples. APOE (rs429358) and BDNF (rs6265) were geno-
typed using MALDI-TOF analysis on the Sequenom MassARRAY 
platform at the Mutation Analysis Facility, Karolinska Institutet 
(Darki et al. 2012). Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium was confirmed 
for both polymorphisms (P’s ≥ 0.10). For APOE, participants were 
grouped as carriers or noncarriers of the ε4 allele, and for BDNF, 
participants were dichotomized into homozygous val/val carriers 
and carriers of any met allele.
Vascular variables
Information on vascular variables was collected through self-report, 
clinical examination, medication lists, laboratory data, and the 
computerized Stockholm inpatient register (Welmer et al. 2014). 
Vascular conditions included in the study were cerebrovascular dis-
ease (stroke), number of cardiovascular diseases (heart failure, atrial 
fibrillation, and coronary heart disease), and number of cardiovas-
cular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol). The 
indexes of both cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk bur-
den ranged from 0 to 3.
Other clinical variables
Other clinical variables that potentially could be related to phan-
tosmia included current diagnosis of depression (ICD-10 criteria), 
as well as self-reported lifetime history of head trauma, migraine, 
epilepsy, any form of cancer, hypothyroidism, and schizophrenia. 
Furthermore, dementia (DSM IV criteria) was diagnosed at each 
testing occasion. The potential effect of dementia conversion up to 
6 years after baseline could therefore be investigated. Due to more 
rapid changes and higher attrition rates in the older cohorts, the fol-
low-up interval was 3 years for older (>78 years of age) and 6 years 
for younger cohorts (60–72 years of age). Dementia conversion was 
treated as a dichotomous variable (dementia vs. no dementia).
Behavioral variables
Current smoking and alcohol consumption were assessed through 
a standardized interview conducted by a nurse. Alcohol consump-
tion was based on self-rated estimations of frequency and amount 
of drinks on a typical drinking day, and categorized into no or 
occasional, light-to-moderate (1–14 drinks/week for men and 1–7 
drinks/week for women), and heavy (>14 drinks/week for men and 
>7 drinks/week for women). No or occasional and light-to-mod-
erate consumption were collapsed in the analysis. Physical activity 
was assessed by a self-administered questionnaire regarding both 
intensity and frequency. Physical inactivity refers to light, moder-
ate, or intense exercise less or equal to 2–3 times per month and 
was compared with physical exercise more than 3 times per month. 
Furthermore, the longest held profession was assessed to investigate

 the differences between unskilled or skilled manufacturing work 
(“blue collar”) and intermediate or highly trained professionals 
(“white collar”). Weight and length for all participants were assessed 
and used to calculate their body mass index (BMI). Obesity was clas-
sified as BMI > 30.
Olfactory functions
Olfactory performance was assessed using Sniffin’ Sticks, a stand-
ardized 16-item odor identification test. The Sniffin’ Sticks test 
battery is a well-validated and norm-referenced test set with high 
test−retest reliability (Hummel et al. 1997; Croy et al. 2015). The 
testing procedure has been described in detail elsewhere (Larsson 
et al. 2016). In short, odors were presented using felt tip-pens con-
taining the following odors: apple, banana, cinnamon, cloves, coffee, 
fish, garlic, leather, lemon, licorice, mushroom, peppermint, petrol, 
pineapple, rose, and turpentine. Participants were first instructed to 
freely identify the odors. If they were unable to correctly identify an 
odor, they were asked to select 1 of 4 written response alternatives 
of which 1 was correct. The score of interest here was the propor-
tion of correctly identified odors with free or cued identification. 
Participants with a score of 10 points or lower were classified as 
having olfactory dysfunction according to established clinical prac-
tice (Hummel et al. 2001).
Parosmia was defined as distorted odor perception where known 
odors are experienced as qualitatively different compared with how 
they are usually perceived (e.g., orange smells like mud). Parosmia 
was measured through self-reports with the question “Have you 
during the last year experienced a distorted sense of smell?”. The 
question was answered on a 5-point scale, where 0 = “never” and 
4 = “always.” Participants were grouped as parosmic (1–4) and non-
parosmic (0 = never).
Cognitive function
As a measure of global cognitive ability, MMSE (Folstein et al. 1975) 
was included.
Statistical analysis
Chi-square tests and t-tests were used to examine potential differ-
ences in the demographic, genetic, clinical, behavioral, olfactory, and 
cognitive variables between those with phantosmia and those with-
out. The relationships between phantosmia and the included varia-
bles were analyzed by hierarchical logistic regression analyses. In the 
first step, gender, age group, and educational level were entered in the 
regression model (block 1). Subsequently, blocks containing genetic 
variables (block 2), vascular diseases and risk factors (block 3), other 
clinical variables (block 4), behavioral variables (block 5), olfactory 
functions (block 6), and cognitive ability (block 7) were entered. As 
a measure of model fit, Nagelkerke’s pseudo-R2 is reported for each 
step. The omnibus chi-square test of model coefficients was used to 
test whether entering a new block resulted in significantly improved 
model fit. Odds ratios (OR) including 95% confidence intervals and 
P-values for each contrast are reported. Potential interaction effects 
between individually contributing factors were assessed. Only statis-
tically significant interaction effects (P < 0.05) were included in the 
final regression model.
An additional analysis was conducted to investigate whether 
participants with rare occurrences of phantosmia modulated the 
observed statistical associations. Here, the reported frequency of 
the phantom smell was used to separate between those with mild 
and more severe phantosmia. Those who experienced phantosmia at 
least once a month were compared with a reference group consisting 
of nonphantosmic individuals and individuals who experienced 
phantosmia less than once a month, using the same statistical pro-
cedure as above.
Results
Prevalence and correlates of phantosmia
The overall prevalence of phantosmia was 4.9% (n = 125). The 
prevalence of phantosmia across the demographic, genetic, vascular, 
clinical, behavioral, olfactory, and cognitive factors is presented in 
Table 1. Individuals with phantosmia were more likely to be women 
(P = 0.038), and BDNF met allele carriers (P = 0.019). They were 
also more likely to have parosmia (P < 0.001). No other signifi-
cant differences between the 2 groups were observed. To reduce the 
number of variables in the regression analyses, variables that were 
nonsignificant at the univariate level and had few observations in 
the phantosmic group (n < 10, Table 1) were not included in the 
subsequent analyses.
Results from the blockwise hierarchical logistic regressions are 
presented in Table 2. The first block, with the demographic variables 
only, was not significantly associated with phantosmia (P = 0.091). 
Adding a genetic (Nagelkerke’s pseudo-R2 = 0.02; P = 0.009) and 
a vascular (Nagelkerke’s pseudo-R2 = 0.04; P = 0.034) block sig-
nificantly improved model fit. Although overall model fit was better 
in the final model, including all 7 blocks (Nagelkerke’s pseudo-
R2 = 0.06, χ2 (19) = 39.48, P = 0.004), adding blocks including clini-
cal, behavioral, olfactory, and cognitive variables did not result in 
significant model improvements.
In the final regression model, a number of significant individual 
correlates were identified. Among the demographic variables, only 
female gender showed an association with phantosmia. Independent of 
demographic information, a significant association was also observed 
with the BDNF met allele. Furthermore, cardiovascular risk burden, 
but none of the other clinical, behavioral, or cognitive variables, con-
tributed significantly to phantosmia. Olfactory dysfunction was not 
related; however, prevalent parosmia showed a strong association to 
phantosmia. Examinations of potential interactions between variables 
revealed no significant effects and are therefore not included in Table 2.
In a follow-up analysis, we investigated the prevalence of severe 
phantosmia (defined as phantosmia experiences at least once a 
month) and found that it was experienced by 1.7% (48 individuals) 
of the sample. Adopting the same statistical procedure as above, we 
found that the final model resulted in a comparatively high model 
fit (Nagelkerke’s pseudo-R2 = 0.12, χ2 (19) = 39.99, P = 0.003). In 
this analysis, female gender was no longer significantly related to 
phantosmia (OR = 1.78, P = 0.140, 95% CI = 0.83–3.83). However, 
the BDNF met allele (OR = 3.45, P < 0.001, 95% CI = 1.74–6.81), 
cardiovascular risk burden (OR = 1.77, P = 0.020, 95% CI = 1.09–
2.87), head trauma (OR = 2.39, P = 0.031, 95% CI = 1.08–5.28), 
and parosmia (OR = 5.95, P = 0.032, 95% CI = 1.17–30.40) were 
all significantly related to severe phantosmia in the final model. 
Hence, the results indicate that the correlates of severe phantosmia 
are largely similar to those of overall phantosmia.
Qualitative descriptions of phantom smells
Qualitative descriptions of frequency and intensity of phantom smell 
perception are summarized in Figure 2A–E. Among the individu-
als with phantosmia (n = 125), 16% had experienced phantosmia 
their entire life, 16% had experienced phantosmia for more than 
10 years, and 17% had experienced phantosmia for less than a year. 
The majority of the phantosmics reported that the intensity of the

 phantom smell was faint (48%) or of medium strength (43%); 9% 
experienced strong phantom smells. Phantom smells were expe-
rienced at least once a week by 20% of the phantosmic sample. 
However, a majority of those who selected the response alternative 
“other” reported that the phantom smell occurred less than once 
a month (54%). Phantom smells within the last few days were 
reported by 24% of the phantosmic group. The phantom smell 
was most commonly reported to last for a few minutes (43%) or to 
appear fleetingly (39%).
The different types of reported phantom smells are described in 
Figure 3. The most frequently reported phantom smell was smoky 
or burnt, reported by 54 of the 117 phantosmic individuals who 
had specified the type of the smell they had experienced. Other smell 
qualities reported were rotten (n = 5), mold (n = 8), metallic (n = 6), 
cooked food (n = 5), perfume (n = 6), flower (n = 6), and dusty and/
or dirty (n = 6). Twenty-eight participants reported more than one 
type of phantom smell.
Nine individuals reported phantom smells with an autobiograph-
ical connotation. The autobiographical descriptions linked to each 
phantom smell are summarized in Table 3. Phantom smells that were 
associated with childhood memories were reported by 3 individuals, 
and 2 individuals reported smells that had been perceived during 
an incident of fire in their homes several years ago. Furthermore, 2 
individuals reported phantom smells that were associated with their 
deceased spouses.
To investigate whether any specific feature of the phantom smell was 
associated with other features, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients 
were calculated. This revealed a significant positive correlation between 
the last occurrence of the phantom smell and how often the phantom 
smell is perceived (r = 0.40, n = 91, P < 0.001). This indicates that

 individuals who have experienced their phantom smell more recently 
also tend to experience the smell more often. An association was also 
observed between how often the smell occurs and how long it lasts 
(r = 0.24, n = 91, P = 0.022), indicating that the phantom smell lasts 
longer in individuals who experience phantom smells more often. The 
associations between duration, frequency, and recency indicate that the 
severity of phantosmia varies systematically among affected individuals.

 Discussion
Although qualitative perceptual distortions, or hallucinations, have 
been investigated in the auditory and visual senses, less is known 
about qualitative distortions in the olfactory sense. This is one of the 
first studies to investigate the experiences of phantosmia, the per-
ception of an odor where the odor source is not present, in a large 
population-based sample of older adults. The overall prevalence 
of phantosmia was 4.9% and was mainly associated with female 
gender, the BDNF met allele, vascular risk burden, and reported 
experience of parosmia, another qualitative odor distortion.
Overall, the prevalence of phantosmia corresponds with prior 
reports conducted in healthy individuals, where phantosmia was 
reported by 6.0–8.5% of the sample (Ohayon 2000; Rawal et al. 
2016). Studies of clinical groups have reported a wider range of 
prevalent phantosmia. Nordin et al. (1996) reported a prevalence of 
phantosmia of 25.6% in a group of chemosensory and nasal/sinus 
patients. However, Landis et al. (2004) investigated phantosmia in 
relatively healthy otorhinolaryngology outpatients and found that 
only 0.8% of those without olfactory loss experienced phantom 
smells. One explanation for the discrepancy could be ascribed to dif-
ferences in how phantosmia has been operationalized and described 
to the participants. Another explanation could be that previous work 
has focused on different groups of patients with mixed pathogenesis.
In our sample, which included individuals between 60 and 
90 years, age was not associated with the prevalence of phantosmia. 
Our finding that 32% of the phantosmics reported that they had 
experienced phantom smells for more than 10 years indicates that, at 
least for some individuals, phantosmia persists from middle age until 
old age. We observed a higher prevalence of phantosmia in women, 
which is in line with previous research. As women in general are bet-
ter than men at naming odors (Larsson et al. 2004), and more often 
than men are negatively affected by environmental odors (Nordin 
et al. 2013), their heightened olfactory sensitivity might make them 
more prone to experiencing phantom smells. However, women were 
not more likely to experience phantom smells when only considering 
those with severe phantosmia. These results might be explained by a 
gender difference in criterion, such that women report phantosmia 
at a lower threshold compared to men.
Although the neurobiological basis of phantosmia is unknown, the 
present study suggests that phantosmia is linked to the presence of the 
BDNF met allele. This statistical relationship remained stable after all 
other variables had been accounted for. The BDNF (rs6265) gene is 
mainly responsible for neuronal survival, transmission, and synaptic 
plasticity (Poo 2001), and previous studies have reported that BDNF 
is implicated in cognitive and olfactory function. Most studies target-
ing the effect of BDNF on cognitive function suggests that met allele 
carriers are more cognitively impaired than homozygote val carri-
ers (see for example Hariri et al. 2003). However, some studies have

 found the opposite relationship, indicating that met allele carriers 
exhibited less age-related cognitive decline (Erickson et al. 2008). We 
previously reported that the met allele might be protective against age-
related decline in olfactory function (Hedner et al. 2010). The BDNF 
gene expression is high in various parts of the central nervous system 
involved in olfaction, including the hippocampus and olfactory bulb 
(Zigova et al. 1998; Poo 2001; Hariri et al. 2003). Although not con-
clusive, our results are consistent with the notion that the met allele 
is associated with increased levels of plasticity in the olfactory sys-
tem, which might result in preserved olfactory function, but also in an 
increased risk of “false alarms” when no odors are present.
In the present study, prevalent parosmia was associated with 
phantosmia. It is possible that the same biological mechanisms under-
lie these 2 qualitative olfactory distortions. In the study by Nordin 
et al. (1996), 9.6% of the participants reported both parosmia and 
phantosmia. In contrast to previous findings, olfactory impairments 
were not related to phantosmia in the current sample. Prior work on 
clinical populations has observed an association between smell loss 
and phantosmia, and these results have been interpreted as support-
ing a peripheral account of the origin of phantosmia (Leopold 2002; 
Hong et al. 2012). The lack of such an association in our sample 
suggests that previous findings might not generalize to the popula-
tion of older individuals.
Furthermore, the present study revealed a significant relationship 
between the number of vascular risk factors and phantosmia. One 
possible explanation to this finding might be that certain medica-
tion alters the olfactory functions and changes olfactory perception 
(Doty and Bromley 2004). No relationship was observed between 
other clinical variables and phantosmia, suggesting that phantosmia 
is specifically linked to vascular conditions.
The relatively low value (0.06) of Nagelkerke’s pseudo-R2 for the 
final model suggest that a large proportion of the variance remained 
unexplained and that other variables, not covered by this study, are 
of importance for the occurrence of phantosmia. However, it should 
be noted that this value was comparatively larger (0.12) in the model 
for severe phantosmia. Restricting the sample of phantosmics to 
individuals with more frequent experiences of phantosmia resulted 
in more distinct group differences, where gender was no longer of 
importance and head trauma appeared as a correlate of phantosmia 
(Lötsch et al. 2016).
The present study also investigated qualitative descriptions of 
prevalent phantosmia, making it one of the first studies to investigate 
the perceived qualities of the phantom smells. The most commonly 
experienced phantom smells were unpleasant, specifically smoky or 
burnt sensations. This confirms previous findings regarding phantom 
smells as well as reports of smell sensations in dreams (Leopold 2002; 
Chen et al. 2003; Stevenson and Case 2004). Why negative odors are 
overrepresented is not yet known, but could be the result of an evo-
lutionary history where detecting and avoiding fire smoke would be 
of particular adaptive value. It has been shown that combat veterans 
with posttraumatic stress disorder are sensitive to fire odors, which 
suggests an exaggerated response to threat-related odors as a result 
of previous experiences (Cortese et al. 2015). It has also been sug-
gested that negative odor sensations are easier to access in memory 
(Konstantinidis et al. 2006; Larsson et al. 2009). However, a number 
of individuals in the present study reported positive phantom smell 
qualities such as flower, perfume, and fruit. Intriguingly, 9 individuals 
reported smells with an autobiographical connotation. This suggests 
that the phantom smells should not be characterized as merely neu-
ral noise originating in the peripheral olfactory system, but instead 
might be linked to personal and meaningful events or memories. 
These findings should be viewed in the context of autobiographical 
memories, which often are more vivid and emotional when gener-
ated by an odor compared with other sensory cues (Larsson and 
Willander 2009; Larsson et al. 2014).
Among the strengths of the present study are the population-
based sample selection and the large sample size. This allows robust 
inferences to the general population. The study, however, also has 
some limitations to consider. Given that the results are based on 
cross-sectional data, the direction of the associations among the 
variables cannot be established, and any causal inferences on risk 
factors for phantosmia cannot be determined. Also, because the age 
range of the sample was restricted to 60–90 years of age, our find-
ings cannot be generalized beyond this age span. Despite the large 
sample size, phantosmia is a relatively rare condition, which reduces 
the power and makes it difficult to clearly establish potential rela-
tionships between the variables of interest.
The subjective and retrospective nature of phantosmia assess-
ment poses certain challenges. In the present study, data were col-
lected through a structured interview. An advantage of this method 
over surveys is that it enables the interviewer to clarify potential 
uncertainties. However, it is difficult to exclude the possibility 
that some of the participants did not understand the meaning of 
phantosmia. As people’s experiences are subjective, 2 individuals 
might classify the same olfactory sensation as 2 different types 
of phantom smells. A further limitation of the present study, and 
other studies, is that the information regarding phantosmia relies 
on retrospective self-reports. The participant might have forgotten 
or overestimated or underestimated how frequent and how intense 
their phantom smells were. To limit this type of bias, future stud-
ies should investigate phantosmia by using prospective diaries in 
which participants can write information about their phantom 
smell continuously. It should also be noted that it cannot be ruled 
out that a source of the odor was in fact present at the time the 
participant experienced the phantom smell. This is especially the 
case for odors where the source of smell might not be visible, for 
example, mold.
To conclude, the present findings suggest that the prevalence of 
phantosmia in the elderly general population is not negligible as 
about 5% reports such experiences. Phantosmia is mainly associated 
with female gender, the BDNF met allele, vascular risk factors, and 
parosmia. It is of interest to note that variables that are frequently 
reported to be beneficial for olfactory function, such as female gen-
der and the BDNF met allele, are also associated with the experi-
ence of phantosmia. Given this pattern of results, it would be of 
interest for future research to determine whether olfactory experts 
(e.g., perfumers, wine experts) are more susceptible to phantosmia 
than nonexperts. Our results complement those of prior work on 
phantosmia in clinical populations with olfactory deficits. Further 
studies are needed to address the epidemiology and underlying bio-
logical mechanisms of phantosmia in healthy individuals as well as 
in clinical groups.
