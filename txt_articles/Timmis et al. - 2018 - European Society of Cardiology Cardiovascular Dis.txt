Aims
The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Atlas has been compiled by the European Heart Agency to document
cardiovascular disease (CVD) statistics of the 56 ESC member countries. A major aim of this 2017 data presenta-
tion has been to compare high-income and middle-income ESC member countries to identify inequalities in disease
burden, outcomes, and service provision.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
The Atlas utilizes a variety of data sources, including the World Health Organization, the Institute for Health
Metrics and Evaluation, and the World Bank to document risk factors, prevalence, and mortality of cardiovascular
disease and national economic indicators. It also includes novel ESC-sponsored survey data of health infrastructure
and cardiovascular service provision provided by the national societies of the ESC member countries. Data presen-
tation is descriptive with no attempt to attach statistical significance to differences observed in stratified analyses.
Important differences were identified between the high-income and middle-income member countries of the ESC
with regard to CVD risk factors, disease incidence, and mortality. For both women and men, the age-standardized
prevalence of hypertension was lower in high-income countries (18% and 27%) compared with middle-income
countries (24% and 30%). Smoking prevalence in men (not women) was also lower (26% vs. 41%) and together
these inequalities are likely to have contributed to the higher CVD mortality in middle-income countries. Declines
in CVD mortality have seen cancer becoming a more common cause of death in a number of high-income member
countries, but in middle-income countries declines in CVD mortality have been less consistent where CVD remains
the leading cause of death. Inequalities in CVD mortality are emphasized by the smaller contribution they make to
potential years of life lost in high-income countries compared with middle-income countries both for women (13%
vs. 23%) and men (20% vs. 27%). The downward mortality trends for CVD may, however, be threatened by the

emerging obesity epidemic that is seeing rates of diabetes increasing across all the ESC member countries. Survey
data from the National Cardiac Societies showed that rates of cardiac catheterization and coronary artery bypass
surgery, as well as the number of specialist centres required to deliver them, were greatest in the high-income
member countries of the ESC. The Atlas confirmed that these ESC member countries, where the facilities for the
contemporary treatment of coronary disease were best developed, were often those in which declines in coronary
mortality have been most pronounced. Economic resources were not the only driver for delivery of equitable
cardiovascular health care, as some middle-income ESC member countries reported rates for interventional proce-
dures and device implantations that matched or exceeded the rates in wealthier member countries.

Conclusion
In documenting national CVD statistics, the Atlas provides valuable insights into the inequalities in risk factors,
health care delivery, and outcomes of CVD across the ESC member countries. The availability of these data will
underpin the ESC’s ambitious mission ‘to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease’ not only in its member
countries but also in nation states around the world.

1. Introduction
The declining rates of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction
(AMI) in many developed countries have been attributed, at least in
part, to risk factor modification at population level.1,2 There is no bet-
ter example of this than the immediate impact of smoke-free legisla-
tion on the incidence of AMI in those countries where it has been
successfully implemented.3,4 Declines in hospitalization rates have
been matched by reductions in case fatality rates,5 both acutely and
during follow-up, reflecting the widespread application of evidence-
based treatment such as reperfusion therapy and drugs to protect
against the progression of coronary disease. Many of these same
treatments are also protective against other manifestations of cardio-
vascular disease, particularly stroke. Appropriate application of pre-
ventive and therapeutic strategies largely accounts for the dramatic
declines in mortality from coronary artery disease that has been
documented in developed countries around the world.
Substantial national resource is needed to organize programmes of
risk reduction and to supply investigational technology and facilities
for contemporary pharmacological and device treatments. Financial
muscle, however, is insufficient without a highly organized legislative
structure and implementation strategies to deliver public health meas-
ures such as smoke-free legislation and sugar taxes and to prioritize
population health above other calls on the national purse. Predictably,
therefore, temporal trends for the global epidemic of coronary artery
disease vary by region6 and the steep declines that have been docu-
mented in many high-income countries have not always been
matched in less prosperous economies. Even within high-income
economies there are disturbing socio-economic gradients of CVD
risk, evidenced in the UK, for example, by the ‘north–south divide’ in
life expectancy.7 Moreover, across all countries, health gains attribut-
able to the prevention and treatment of CVD are likely to be eroded
by the obesity epidemic and the surge in incident diabetes.8,9 Thus,
three
European
Action
on
Secondary
Prevention
through
Intervention to Reduce Events (EUROASPIRE) surveys between
1999 and 2013 in patients with established coronary disease from
nine different European countries showed increases in the prevalence
of obesity and self-reported diabetes of 7% and 6%, respectively.10
There is considerable diversity of national resources across
Europe, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita ranges from
<$5000 in some Eastern countries to >$50000 in the West
(Figure 1). Political and organizational aspects of health care show
similar variation—the net result being huge disparities in population
CVD risks and the resources available for prevention and treatment.
Documentation of these national disparities is essential if the
European Society of Cardiology (ESC) is to succeed in its mission to
‘reduce the burden of CVD’. It is for this purpose that the ESC Atlas
of Cardiology has been established. Details of the Atlas, including
data collection, validation, organization, and outputs, have been previ-
ously presented.11 In summary, it is a database of cardiovascular and
health system information, for ESC member countries that synthe-
sizes quantitative material from the World Health Organization
(WHO), the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study undertaken by
the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) and the World
Bank (WB) with national cardiovascular data collected by the ESC
and the National Cardiac Societies (NCS). This permits:
• Investigation of how system characteristics and policies at
national level associate with cardiac care resources, throughputs,
and outcomes.
• Generation of country-specific reports and cross-country compa-
rative analyses.
This comprehensive report of cardiovascular statistics for the
European member states of the ESC responds to WHO recommen-
dations for the development of surveillance and monitoring pro-
grammes to understand the international distribution of CVD and
predict future trends.12 We report on country-specific risk factors
and health behaviours as they associate with economic status, health
spending, and cardiovascular outcomes. We examine disparities
between the different member states in disease burden and CVD
outcomes and seek to identify targets for reducing the burden of
CVD and delivering equitable disease management across the
continent.
2. Data sources and data
presentation
Key data sources for the ESC Atlas include:
• ESC: statistics on national cardiovascular infrastructure and pro-
cedures derived from a survey of the NCS of 41 ESC member
countries.
• WHO: risk factor and mortality statistics.
• IHME: morbidity and disease burden statistics from the GBD
study.
• WB: economic indicators.
Other data sources include the Food and Agriculture Organization
of the United Nations (FAO) (http://faostat.fao.org/beta/en/), which
provided dietary data and the Health Behaviour in School age
Children (HBSC) survey (www.hbsc.org/), which provided data on
childhood obesity.
2.1 European Society of Cardiology Atlas
of Cardiology data
The Atlas contains more than 100 variables relating to human and
capital infrastructure and major cardiovascular interventions and
services from 41 of the 56 ESC member countries.11 Specific varia-
bles developed by a task force were included in a questionnaire circu-
lated to the NCS of participating ESC member countries. The data
collected were then subjected to quality control procedures, includ-
ing comparison with other data sources to identify outliers and illogi-
cal values. These values were then discussed with the source NCS
and corrected where necessary. The data were reviewed by

independent experts before final approval by the NCS. All original
data sources were recorded for tracking purposes.
The survey yields absolute numbers for resources and procedures.
Crude rates per million people are computed from WB population
estimates (http://data.worldbank.org/indicator).
2.2 World Health Organization data
Mortality data are from the WHO mortality database (http://
www.who.int/healthinfo/mortality_data/en/) using the September
2016 update of age- and cause-specific mortality data by country.
These data are publicly available. This article presents mortality
data for 47 of the 56 ESC member countries, all from the WHO
European Region. No data are presented for Algeria, Egypt, Libya,
Morocco, Tunisia, Republic of Kosovo, Lebanon, or Syrian Arab
Republic.
The WHO database collates data on the absolute number of med-
ically certified deaths from national authorities based on their vital
registration systems. From these primary data, mortality rates are

 calculated using country-level data on population size from the same
database as denominators. Age-standardized rates are computed
using the direct method with the 2013 European Standard
Population (ESP) to control for cross-national differences in popula-
tion age structures. The 2013 ESP was developed as an update to the
1976 ESP by the European Commission for the EU27 and European
Free Trade Association countries to better reflect the age structure
of the current European population.
The data presented in the WHO Mortality Database and in this
article are as submitted by individual countries to WHO. No adjust-
ments have been made to account for potential bias in reporting. As
a result, the quality of mortality data varies between countries, with
more accurate data for countries with well-functioning vital registra-
tion systems compared with those with weaker systems. Even for
countries with strong vital registration systems, however, regional
patterns
of
clinical
diagnosis
may
reduce
cross-country
comparability.
In general, the mortality data are up to date, with the most recent
data for only 7 of the 47 countries dating from 2010 or before.
However, in some cases, individual countries are yet to provide their
most recent statistics, with the result that the information obtained
from the WHO might not be as up to date as that available from the
databases of these individual countries.
National data on metabolic/biological risk factors are derived
from the WHO and Noncommunicable Diseases Risk Factor
Collaboration (NCD-RisC) and are based on population data.
Estimates are age-standardized to facilitate international compari-
sons. Details of methods and data sources are described else-
where.8,13–15 National physical activity data come from surveys
presenting gender- and age-specific estimates relating to WHO activ-
ity recommendations, with regression modelling to determine levels
of insufficient activity.
2.3 Global Burden of Disease: Institute
for Health Metrics and Evaluation data
Estimates of CVD prevalence come from the GBD study, conducted
by the IHME (http://www.healthdata.org/). The estimates are derived
using modelling software and data from health surveys, prospective
cohorts, health system administrative data, and registries.16,17 The
GBD study also provides estimates of disability-adjusted life years
(DALYs) from estimates of years living with CVD and years of life
lost.
2.4 World Bank data
Data on various economic indicators come from the WB (http://data
bank.worldbank.org/data/). These data are drawn from official sour-
ces, and in converting estimates of gross national income (GNI) and
GNI per capita from national currencies to US dollars, the WB uses
the Atlas conversion factor to help reduce the impact of exchange
rate fluctuations in the cross-country comparison of national
incomes. The WB also provides national population data that were
used for calculating rate estimates for ESC member countries.
2.5 Data presentation and analysis
Data from the Atlas are presented, according to availability, for 56
ESC member countries (Table 1, Figure 2).

Data presentation in this report is descriptive, illustrated by tables
and charts from the ESC Atlas, with only limited interpretation in the
short commentary paragraphs at the end of each section. No attempt
is made to attach statistical significance to differences observed in
stratified analyses, and there is no assumption of causation when
associations are identified. For consistency, averaged statistics across
groups of countries are presented as means in this article, but median
values are also included in the tables and box plots for national sub-
groups. Box plots were used almost exclusively for comparison of
CVD statistics between high-income and middle-income ESC mem-
ber countries. According to the WB definition, high-income coun-
tries are those in which 2016 GNI per capita was US$12 000 or
more.
(https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/
906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups). Throughout the
article, the term ‘middle-income countries’ represent a composite of
upper- and lower-middle income ESC member countries. The plots
display a box representing median values and first and third quartile
values, with whiskers positioned at the furthest data points within 1.5
times the interquartile range. Any countries outside this range are
defined as outliers and are plotted individually.
2.6 Limitations
Much of the data in the Atlas are from the WHO, IHME, and WB,
which together constitute the most credible sources of national esti-
mates of CVD, associated risk factors and financial statistics. The val-
idity of the statistics these sources provide is a function of the
procedures applied in their collection that can be reviewed in the
source addresses provided throughout the article in the relevant sec-
tion headings. General limitations of the data include the adjustment
applied by all the main providers to account for missing data and dif-
ferences in reporting practices such that precision of the estimates
they provide often varies by country. Misclassification bias due to mis-
coding of diagnostic groups and death certificates is another potential
limitation. Data completeness is clearly defined within each section of
the article and for most indicators exceeds 80% although it is lower
for diabetes in adults (75%), overweight and obesity in children

(56%), smoking in children (64%), and physical activity in adults (64%)
and children (68%). There is also variably missing data in some of the
time series collections, indicated by blank cells within the relevant
tables, such that in some cases our analysis has had to be restricted
to patients with data entries at the start, middle, and final date of the
series. National cardiovascular infrastructure and procedure data are
at present available for only 41 (73%) of ESC member countries. The
Atlas does not provide information about within-country inequal-
ities.7,18 Moreover, inequalities between the WB-classified high- and
middle-income countries are determined by comparing national
means averaged across the groups, which obscures within-category
inequalities. The presentation of minimum and maximum statistics
around group means helps mitigate this issue.
The limitations as they apply to the quality, precision, and availabil-
ity of the data emphasize the need for cautious interpretation of the
CVD statistics presented in this report.
3. Risk factors and health
behaviours
The identification of major risk factors that predispose to the devel-
opment of non-fatal and fatal CVD was a key contribution of the
Framingham Heart Study.19 The Framingham findings have been
extensively validated and their global importance was confirmed in
INTERHEART, a case–control study conducted in 52 countries,
which showed that only nine potentially reversible risk factors and
health behaviours (alcohol, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes,
diet, obesity psychosocial factors, sedentary lifestyle, and smoking)
account for >90% of the population attributable risk of acute myo-
cardial infarction (AMI) in all regions of the world.20 (Population
attributable risk is the portion of the incidence of a disease in the
population, exposed and non-exposed, that is due to exposure. It is
the percent of the incidence of a disease in the population that would
be eliminated if exposure were eliminated.) This identified AMI, and,
by extension, other manifestations of CVD, as a major preventable
disorder, and there is now extensive evidence that the decline in hos-
pitalization rates for AMI that have been recorded in many developed
countries in recent years is at least partly attributable to health
behaviour and risk factor modification at population level.1,2 In this
section, the prevalence and time course of health behaviours and risk
factors of the ESC member countries are presented.
3.1 Risk factors
3.1.1 Blood pressure
Data: age-standardized prevalence of raised blood pressure
(mmHg), 181 years, by gender; Data source: WHO Global
Health
Observatory
http://www.who.int/gho/database/en;
Completeness: Europe 37/39; Non-European former Russian
Republics 9/9; E Med & N Africa 1/8; Year of data: 2014.
Data: mean systolic blood pressure (mmHg), 181 years, by
gender; Data source: WHO Global Health Observatory
http://www.who.int/gho/database/en; Completeness: Europe
37/39; Non-European former Russian Republics 9/9; E Med &
N Africa 1/8; Year of data: 2014.
Blood pressure levels show a continuous linear relation to the risk of
stroke and myocardial infarction.21 The INTERHEART study estimated
that 22% of myocardial infarctions in Europe are related to hyperten-
sion, which almost doubles the risk compared with people with no his-
tory of hypertension.20 The added risk of CVD attributable to
hypertension can be largely reversed by antihypertensive treatment.22
• National statistics: The age-standardized prevalence of raised
blood pressure in 2014 varied across the ESC member countries
(raised blood pressure is defined as a systolic blood pressure of
>
_ 140 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of >
_ 90 mmHg; data
from population-based surveys and surveillance systems of meas-
ured blood pressure), ranging from 15.2% in the UK to 31.7% in
Estonia. (see Supplementary material online, Table S1, Figure 3).
Average blood pressure levels also varied between countries,
with a mean systolic level for women of 115 mmHg in France
compared with 130 mmHg in Republic of Moldova and for men
of 138 mmHg in Slovak Republic compared with 121 mmHg in
Turkey (see Supplementary material online, Table S2, Figure 4).
• Stratification by gender: The prevalence of hypertension in all the
ESC member countries for which data were available was lower
in women than in men, with averaged rates of 20.2% and 28.4%,
respectively. This was reflected in blood pressure levels of
122 mmHg in women and 131 mmHg in men averaged across
member countries (see Supplementary material online, Tables S1
and S2, Figures 3 and 4).
• Time series data: Systolic blood pressure in ESC member coun-
tries trended downwards between 1980 and 2014, with mean
values falling from 134 to 122 mmHg in women and 137 to
131 mmHg in men (Figure 5A and B).
• Stratification by national income status: The average prevalence
of age-standardized raised blood pressure in women and men
was 18.3% and 27.3% in high-income ESC member countries and
23.5% and 30.3% in middle-income countries (see Supplementary
material online, Table S1, Figure 6). Average blood pressure levels
also varied by national income status, with a mean systolic level
for women and men of 120 mmHg and 130 mmHg in high-
income countries and 126 mmHg and 133 mmHg in middle-
income countries (see Supplementary material online, Table S2,
Figure 7). Between 1980 and 2014, systolic blood pressure, aver-
aged across high-income countries, changed downwards from
134 to 120 mmHg in women and 138 mmHg to 130 mmHg in
men. Changes in middle-income countries showed a similar
downward trend in women (134 to 126 mmHg), but were less
marked in men (135 to 133 mmHg) (Figure 5A and B).

The risk of coronary heart disease death increases linearly with
increasing blood cholesterol levels.23 Globally, about 33% of coro-
nary heart disease cases can be attributed to hypercholesterolaemia.
Cholesterol is a major target of risk reduction programmes; a 10%
reduction in total cholesterol levels in middle-aged men results
in a 50% reduction in heart disease rates within 5 years.24
Hypercholesterolaemia is most common in high-income countries,
and the WHO reports that Europe tops the league in the Northern
Hemisphere with a 54% prevalence, followed by the Americas with a
48% prevalence, which contrasts with a 23% prevalence in Africa.24
• National statistics stratified by gender: Data for 2009 showed
that the mean blood cholesterol concentration averaged across
all ESC member countries was 5.1 mmol/L in both women and

men, ranging from 4.5 and 4.4 mmol/L in women and men from
Kyrgyzstan to 5.6 mmol/L in women and men from Iceland (see
Supplementary material online, Table S3). The mean age-
standardized prevalence of hypercholesterolaemia (�6.2 mmol/
L) averaged across member countries was 16.4% and 15.8% in
women and men, ranging from <10% in Azerbaijan, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Republic of Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Republic of
Moldova, and Turkey to >20% in Belgium, Finland, France,
Germany, Ireland, Norway, and UK (see Supplementary material
online, Table S4, Figure 8).
• Time series data: Blood cholesterol concentrations averaged
across the ESC member countries declined from 5.6 to
5.1 mmol/L in women and men between 1980 and 2009 (Figure
9A and B).

and 5.3 mmol/L in high-income countries and 4.9 and 4.8 mmol/L
in middle-income countries (see Supplementary material online,
Table S3, Figure 10). This difference between high- and middle-
income countries was reflected in mean age-standardized preva-
lence rates for hypercholesterolaemia (�6.2 mmol/L) that were
18.9% and 19.0% in women and men from high-income countries
and 12.0% and 10.0% in women and men from middle-income
countries
(see
Supplementary
material
online,
Table
S4,
Figure 11). Between 1980 and 2009, blood cholesterol concentra-
tions, averaged across high-income countries, changed from 5.8
to 5.2 mmol/L in women and from 5.8 to 5.3 mmol/L in men.
Quantitatively similar changes were recorded in women (5.3 to
4.9 mmol/L) and men (5.2 to 4.8 mmol/L) in middle-income
countries (Figure 9A and B).

glucose, 181 years, by gender; Data source: WHO Global

The WHO reports over 60 million people currently living with dia-
betes in the European region,25 with type 2 diabetes mellitus
accounting for the majority of cases. The high and increasing preva-
lence of diabetes is largely attributed to overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m2)
and obesity (BMI > 30kg/m2), which in turn largely results from
excess dietary calories and physical inactivity.
• National statistics: The prevalence of diabetes by 2014 estimates was
on average 6.5% across the ESC member countries. The prevalence
ranged from <3% in Republic of Moldova, Republic of Georgia,
Azerbaijan, Albania, Armenia, and Ukraine to >14% in Lebanon,
Egypt, and Turkey (see Supplementary material online, Table S5,
Figure 12). The prevalence of raised blood glucose in women aver-
aged 6.5% across ESC member countries, ranging from only 2.8% in
Switzerland to 14.2% in Turkey. In men, the average prevalence was
7.9%, ranging from 5.2% in Netherlands to 13.3% in Republic of
Georgia (see Supplementary material online, Table S6, Figure 13).
• Temporal changes by national income status: Prevalence data for
diabetes at three time points (1995–2000, 2005–2008 and 2014)
were available for 23 countries with one further country provid-
ing data for 1995–2000 and 2014. Across that time-frame, the
average prevalence increased from 2.0% to 4.1%, with compara-
ble changes in high-income (3.0–5.7%) and middle-income (1.0–
2.4%) countries (see Supplementary material online, Table S7,
Figure 14). Although the prevalence of diabetes was higher in
high-income countries, the age-standardized prevalence of raised
blood glucose (defined as fasting glucose >
_126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/
l) or on medication for raised blood glucose) was lower com-
pared with middle-income countries for both women (5.2% vs.
8.9%) and men (7.2% vs. 9.2%)( see Supplementary material
online, Table S6, Figure 15). These contradictory statistics may
reflect under-diagnosis of diabetes and/or less effective glycaemic
control in middle-income countries.

Data: Prevalence of overweight or obesity among children,
11, 13 and 15 years, by gender; Data source: HBSC
Survey
2014/15
http://www.hbsc.org/publications/interna
tional/; Completeness: Europe 32/39; Non-European for-
mer Russian Republics 4/9; E Med & N Africa 1/8. Year of
data: 2013/14.
Across the world, rates of obesity are increasing rapidly.8 A recent
meta-analysis concluded that the consequences for all-cause mortal-
ity were severe and consistent across four continents. In Europe and
North America, obesity is now second only to smoking as a risk fac-
tor for premature death.26
• National statistics: Age-standardized mean body mass index
(BMI) averaged across the ESC member countries was similar for
women and men (25.8 and 26.8 kg/m2), ranging from 23.8 kg/m2
in women from Switzerland to 28.5 kg/m2 in women from
Turkey (see Supplementary material online, Table S8, Figure 16).
Data for 2014 showed that, across ESC member countries, more
than one in five adult women and men were obese (WHO defi-
nitions of overweight and obesity are BMIs of >
_ 25 kg/m2 and
>
_30 kg/m2, respectively), as reflected by prevalence rates of
22.9% and 21.4% (see Supplementary material online, Table S9,
Figure 17). Female obesity was most common in Turkey, where it
affected more than one in three women. Male obesity was most
common in Czech Republic, Ireland, Luxembourg, and UK,
where it affected more than one in four men.
• Time series data: Between 1980 and 2014, age-standardized BMI
averaged across the ESC member countries increased from 25.2

About 28% of all Europeans are smokers, putting the continent
towards the top of the international smoking league, with tobacco-
related disease accounting for an estimated 700,000 premature
deaths every year.28
• National statistics stratified by gender: In men aged �15 years, the
national prevalence of smoking, based on the latest year estimates,
averaged 31.5% across the ESC member countries for which data
were available. The prevalence ranged from �15% in Iceland,
Norway, and Sweden to >50% in Republic of Georgia, Latvia,
Republic of Moldova, and Russian Federation. For women, smok-
ing prevalence was lower averaging 15.8% across the ESC mem-
ber countries. The prevalence ranged from <10% in Albania,
Armenia, Belarus, Republic of Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
and Lithuania to> 25% in Bulgaria, Greece, Montenegro, Serbia
and TFYR Macedonia. Among two of the four ESC member
countries where >50% of men were smokers the prevalence
among women was <10%, emphasising the importance of cultural
factors in determining smoking behaviour, particularly in women
(see Supplementary material online, Table S11, Figure 20).
• Temporal changes: Complete prevalence data for smoking across
three time periods between 1995 and 2014 were available for
only 28 and 27 countries in women and men. During that period,
the averaged prevalence of smoking reduced from 21.4% to
16.1% in women and from 37.0% to 26.9% in men (see
Supplementary material online, Table S12, Figure 21A and B).
• Stratification by national income status: Comparison of smoking
prevalence in high-and middle-income ESC member countries
showed divergent gender differences. Among women aged
�15 years, smoking prevalence, based on the latest available esti-
mates in each country, was 17.0% in high-income countries and
13.6% in middle-income countries. For men, the pattern was dif-
ferent with smoking prevalence 26.0% in high-income countries
and 41.3% in middle-income countries (see Supplementary mate
rial online, Table S11, Figure 22).
• Smoking in children: Among girls and boys aged 15 years, the
prevalence of at least weekly smoking recorded in 2013–14 aver-
aged 12.1% and 13.5%, respectively, across the European mem-
ber countries with considerable variation between countries (see
Supplementary material online, Table S13, Figure 23). In Bulgaria,
Croatia, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, and Romania, �20% of boys
were smokers compared with �5% in Armenia, Iceland, and
Norway. Similar variation was seen in girls, with �20% smoking
in Bulgaria, Croatia, France, Hungary, and Italy, but �3% in
Armenia, Iceland, and Norway. Since the millennium, high-income
countries have seen declines in smoking prevalence in girls (24.1–
12.3%) and boys (23.5–12.9%). Similar declines have also been
seen in middle-income countries for girls (18.0–11.2%) and boys
(28.9–16.3%) (see Supplementary material online, Table S13).

According to Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015–20, moder-
ate drinking is up to one drink per day for women and up to two
drinks per day for men.29 This is comparable to guideline recommen-
dations in Ireland, Denmark, and Czech Republic but greater than the
recently updated recommendations in the UK.30 Excessive alcohol
consumption remains a leading cause of premature death, data from
the USA showing it is responsible for 1 in 10 deaths among working
age adults.31
• National statistics: In European women and men aged �15 years,
alcohol consumption, averaged across the ESC member coun-
tries for which data were available, was 8.7 L/capita/year based
on the latest year estimates. (Alcohol consumption is defined as
the recorded amount of pure alcohol in litres consumed per
adult (15þyears) over a calendar year in a country, in litres of
pure alcohol. The indicator only takes into account the consump-
tion that is recorded from production, import, export, and sales
data, often via taxation.) There were, however, large differences
between countries, with consumption ranging from <4 L/capita/
year in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Israel, Kyrgyzstan, TFYR Macedonia,
and Turkey to >13 L/capita/year in Belarus and Lithuania (see
Supplementary material online, Table S14, Figure 24).
• Stratification by gender: Age-standardized data for 2010, averaged
across 47 ESC member countries for which data were available,
showed that heavy episodic drinking in the past 30 days (defined
as consumption of at least 60 g of pure alcohol on at least one
occasion based on data from population surveys, weighted for
abstainers and population size) was less prevalent among women
than men (8.3% vs. 30.0%) (see Supplementary material online,
Table S15, Figure 25). Rates �50% were recorded for men in
Austria, Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, and Lithuania. Rates
tended to be high among women in these same countries and
exceeded 20% for women in Austria and Lithuania.
• Time series data: There has been little change in alcohol con-
sumption in recent years, with an average 8.6 L/capita/year aver-
aged across the ESC member countries in 1996–2000 compared
with 8.8 L/capita/year in 2014 (Figure 26).
• Stratification by national income status: Alcohol consumption
averaged across the ESC member countries was 9.9 L/capita/year
in high-income countries compared with 6.6 L/capita/year in low-
income countries (see Supplementary material online, Table S14,

Figure 27). The average prevalence of heavy episodic drinking in
women and men was 10.7% and 34.6% in high-income countries
compared with 4.0% and and 22.1% in middle-income countries
(see Supplementary material online, Table S15, Figure 28).
3.2.3 Diet
Data: Diet, fat, and energy consumption. Data source:
Food
and
Agriculture
Organization
of
the
United
Nations (FAO) http://faostat.fao.org/beta/en/; Completeness:
Europe 37/39; Non-European former Russian Republics 9/9;
E Med & N Africa 1/8. Year of data: 2011.
In a recent report from the PURE study investigators,32 higher fruit,
vegetable, and legume consumption was associated with a lower risk of
non-cardiovascular and total mortality. Benefits appeared to be maxi-
mum for both non-cardiovascular mortality and total mortality at three
to four servings per day (equivalent to 375–500g/day). A US study
found that the aggregate of 14 sub-components of diet was a more
important risk factor for disease than either physical inactivity or high
BMI and was associated with 26% of all deaths and 14% of DALYs.33
However, the authors cautioned that results for diet are limited by the
precision of the measurement and similar caution needs exercising in
the interpretation of dietary data recorded in the Atlas. (National food
consumption data presented in this section come from the FAO, which
collects country-level data on food production and trade. The actual
food consumption may be lower than the quantity shown as food avail-
ability depends on the magnitude of wastage and losses in the house-
hold, e.g. during storage, in preparation and cooking, as plate waste or
quantities fed to domestic animals and pets, thrown or given away.)
• Energy consumption: Data from FAO showed that total energy
consumption (the amount of food, in kilocalories per day, available
for each individual in the total population) in 2011, averaged
across the ESC member countries, was 3254 kcal/day. Energy con-
sumption was similar in high- (3354 kcal/day) and middle-
(3077 kcal/day) income countries and has increased only slightly in
recent years from 3036 kcal/day in 1995 to 3254 kcal/day in 2011.
Average consumption during this period has been higher in high-
income countries, increasing from 3197 to 3354 kcal/day com-
pared with 2736 to 3077 kcal/day in middle-income countries (see
Supplementary material online, Table S16, Figures 29A and 30A).
• Fat consumption: Estimates for fat consumed across the ESC mem-
ber countries in 2011 averaged 120.5 g/capita/day. Consumption
was higher in high-income compared with middle-income countries
(135.7 vs. 93.7 g/capita/day). Time series data for the period 1995–
2011 showed increasing consumption from a mean of 103.4 to
120.5 g/capita/day between 1995 and 2011. Consumption during
this period has been higher in high-income countries, increasing
from a mean of 123.1 to 135.7 g/capita/day compared with 67.0 to
93.7 g/capita/day in middle-income countries (see Supplementary
material online, Table S16, Figures 29B and 30B).
• Vegetable and fruit consumption: Estimates for vegetables and
fruit consumed across the ESC member countries in 2011 aver-
aged 135.9 kg/capita/year and 94.4 kg/capita/year, respectively.
For vegetables, consumption was lower in high-income com-
pared with middle-income countries (115.0 vs. 172.6 kg/capita/
year), but for fruit the pattern was different with consumption
higher in high-income countries (103.8 vs. 77.9 kg/capita/year)
(see Supplementary material online, Table S16, Figures 29C and D
and 30C and D). Time series data for the period 1995–2011
showed increasing consumption of both vegetables (107.1 to
135.9 kg/capita/year) and fruit (74.5–94.4 kg/capita/year) averaged
across the ESC member countries.

In a cohort of 334 161 European men and women followed up for
12.4 years, individuals who exercised only moderately reduced the
hazard of all-cause mortality by 16–30% compared with those cate-
gorized as inactive.34 The study was consistent with earlier findings
that physical inactivity has a major health effect worldwide and that a
decrease or removal of this unhealthy behaviour could improve
health substantially.35

• Physical activity in adults: Self-reported physical activity using
validated questionnaires was graded ‘insufficient’ in a mean of
30.1% of women and 22.7% of men across the ESC member
countries (see Supplementary material online, Table S17, Figure
31). [The prevalence of insufficient physical activity is repre-
sented by the percent of defined population attaining less than
150 min of moderate-intensity physical activity per week or less
than 75 min of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week.
Based on self-reported physical activity captured using the
GPAQ (Global Physical Activity Questionnaire), the IPAQ
(International Physical Activity Questionnaire) or similar (age-
standardized estimates)]. In Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Portugal,
Serbia, and UK, �30% of men and >40% of women reported
insufficient physical activity. In Malta, the prevalence was yet
higher at 50% and 40% for women and men. The average prev-
alence of insufficiently active women and men was 31.2% and
23.5% in high-income countries compared with 26.8% and
20.0% in middle-income countries (see Supplementary material
online, Table S17, Figure 32).
• Physical activity in children: Data for 2013–14 show that for all
ESC member countries, the average proportion of 15-year-old
children participating in at least 1 h per day of moderate to vigo-
rous physical activity (defined as any activity that increases the
heart rate and makes the person get out of breath some of the
time) tended to be lower in girls compared with boys (Figure 33).
This applied across 11-, 13-, and 15-year-old age groups, in which
proportions undertaking 1 h/day or more of vigorous physical
activity tended to decline with age in both girls (21%, 15%, and
10%) and boys (30%, 25%, and 20%) (see Supplementary material
online, Table S18). In high-income ESC member countries,
participation in at least 1 h of moderate to vigorous physical
activity per day among groups aged 11, 13, and 15 years was
20%, 14%, and 9% in girls and 29%, 23%, and 19% in boys,
respectively. In middle-income countries, participation was higher
with proportions of 26%, 21%, and 15% in girls and 35%, 30%,
and 25% in boys (see Supplementary material online, Table S18,
Figure 34).
3.3 Commentary
Across the ESC member countries, variation in the prevalence of
major risk factors for cardiovascular disease represents a failure of
effective health policy and public education that condemns
large populations to premature death from ischaemic heart disease
and stroke. It is salutary to note that the risk factors driving
cardiovascular disease are potentially reversible, providing huge

opportunity to address these international health inequalities.
Indeed, it was not long ago that today’s high-income countries had
risk factor prevalence statistics similar to those now recorded in
some of the middle-income member countries of the ESC. The
steep declines in cardiovascular mortality that many high-income
countries have enjoyed are largely explained by risk factor modifi-
cation, making the opportunity to eliminate cardiovascular inequal-
ities across Europe and elsewhere in the world one of the key
health care challenges of the 21st century. The successful imple-
mentation of treatments to lower blood pressure and blood lipid
concentrations along with smoking cessation measures in high-
income countries now need exporting to the health care systems
of middle-income countries to allow their populations to share the
health benefits. Meanwhile the emerging obesity epidemic affecting
high-income countries, driven by physical inactivity and dietary
indiscretion, needs determined action if the steep downward trend
in cardiovascular mortality that has occurred in the last 50 years is
to be maintained. The ESC Atlas of cardiovascular statistics clearly
identifies the national risk factor profiles and the targets for inter-
vention that need addressing to reduce the health inequalities
across the ESC member countries.

Mediterranean and North African countries. Its societal impact
is huge in terms of both the direct costs incurred in its manage-
ment36–38 and the indirect costs related to absenteeism, lost produc-
tivity, and mortality. Total costs exceed those for any other major
diagnostic group.39 Thus, the national prevalence statistics and trends
over time that are recorded in the Atlas have important implications
for the national economies of ESC member countries in addition to
their implications for population health.
4.1 Incidence of cardiovascular disease
Data: Incidence of CVD, ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and
stroke, by gender; Data source: GBD database http://www.
healthdata.org/gbd/data;
Completeness:
Europe
37/39;
Non-European former Russian Republics 9/9; E Med & N
Africa 1/8; Year of data: 1990–2015.
Disease incidence is the rate of occurrence of new cases in a given
population. It conveys information about the risk of contracting the
disease.
• National statistics: There were ~11 million new cases of CVD in
the 47 ESC member countries for which 2015 data were avail-
able (2015 data unavailable for Republic of Kosovo, Republic of
San Marino, Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Syrian Arab
Republic and Tunisia). Ischaemic heart disease accounted for
about 50% of these cases and stroke for about 14%. National
contributions of incident cases in part reflected the size of the
different ESC member countries, Russian Federation contributing
the most cases (~2.5 million) and Iceland the fewest (~2500)
(see Supplementary material online, Table S19).
• Stratification by gender: Women accounted for more new cases
of CVD compared with men (~5.7 million cases vs. ~5.3 million
cases), but new cases of IHD were more frequent in men (~2.7
million vs. ~2.9 million), whereas new cases of stroke were more
frequent in women (~0.85 million vs. ~0.65 million).
• Time series data: There was a steady increase in incident cases of
CVD between 1990 and 2015 in both women (~4.9 million–
~5.7 million) and men (~4.3 million–~5.3 million). This was seen
across all the ESC member countries, except for Denmark,
Republic of Georgia, Germany, Latvia, and the UK, which
recorded small declines in incident CVD among women and
Hungary and the UK, which recorded small declines in men (see
Supplementary material online, Table S20, Figure 35A and B).
• Stratification by national income status: Incident cases of CVD,
averaged across ESC member countries, increased in high- and
middle-income countries by 11% and 22% in women and by 17%
and 26% in men (see Supplementary material online, Table S20,
Figure 35A and B).
4.2 Prevalence of cardiovascular disease
Data: Age-standardized prevalence rate per 100 000 of
CVD, by gender; Data source: GBD database http://www.
healthdata.org/gbd/data;
Completeness:
Europe
36/39;
Non-European former Russian Republics 9/9; E Med & N
Africa 1/8; Year of data: 1990 to 2015.
Disease prevalence is the proportion of cases in the population at
a given time. It indicates how widespread the disease is.
• National statistics: There were ~83.5 million people living with
CVD in ESC member countries in 2015. The prevalence was
driven predominantly by peripheral vascular disease (~35.7 mil-
lion), followed by IHD (~29.4 million), other CVD such as peri-
cardial disease, valvular heart disease (~13.3 million), atrial
fibrillation
(~9.5
million)
and
stroke
(~7.5
million)
(see
Supplementary material online, Table S21). With age-standardiza-
tion, the prevalence of CVD per 100000 people averaged across
all ESC member countries in 2015 remained driven by peripheral
vascular disease, (5373) followed by IHD (4390), other CVD
(2211),
atrial
fibrillation
(1450)
and
stroke
(1220)
(see
Supplementary material online, Table S22).
• Stratification by gender: Age-standardized prevalence rates for
CVD in women exceeded 7000 per 100000 people in Czech
Republic, Republic of Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkey. In men,
rates in excess of 9000 per 100000 people were recorded in
Bulgaria, Croatia, Russian Federation, and Slovak Republic. (see
Supplementary material online, Table S22). For all CVD pheno-
types, including IHD, stroke, and PVD, age-standardized preva-
lence averaged across the ESC member countries was lower in
women compared with men. Absolute numbers of prevalent
cases, however, showed inequalities between women and men
according to CVD phenotype with ~0.9 million and ~5.7 million
more prevalent cases of stroke and peripheral vascular disease in
women compared with men and ~3.6 million and ~0.5 million
more prevalent cases of IHD and atrial fibrillation in men com-
pared with women.

• Time series data: Age-standardized prevalent cases of CVD per
100000 people, averaged across all ESC member countries,
showed little change between 1990 and 2015 in women (5863
to 5586) or men (7671 to 7200). In many countries, a small
decline in the age-standardized prevalence was recorded but in 6
of the 16 middle-income countries for which data were available
(Armenia,
Belarus,
Bosnia
and
Herzegovina,
Kazakhstan,
Montenegro, and Ukraine) small increases in prevalence were
recorded in both women and men. Small increases in prevalence
were also recorded in TFYR Macedonia (women only) and
Kyrgyzstan (men only) (see Supplementary material online, Table
S23, Figure 36A and B).
• Stratification by national income status: Age-standardized preva-
lent cases of CVD per 100000 people in high- and middle-
income countries were 5093 and 6570 for women compared
with 6563 and 8358 for men. Ischaemic heart disease was less
prevalent in high-income compared with middle-income coun-
tries in women (1212 vs. 2212) and men (2267 vs. 3788).
Stroke prevalence showed similar inequality between high- and
middle-income countries in women (448 vs. 843) and men
(497 vs. 863) (see Supplementary material online, Table S22,
Figure 37).
4.3 Disability-adjusted life years lost to
cardiovascular disease
Data: Age-standardized rate of DALYs lost per 100 000 from
CVD, by gender; Data source: Global Burden of Disease data-
base
http://www.healthdata.org/gbd/data;
Completeness:
Europe 37/39; Non-European former Russian Republics 9/9;
E Med & N Africa 1/8; Y
ear of data: 1990–2015.
Disability-adjusted life-years combine information regarding pre-
mature death (years of life lost) and disability caused by the CVD
(years lived with CVD) to provide a summary measure of health lost
due to that condition. One DALY can be thought of as one lost year
of ‘healthy’ life. The sum of these DALYs across the population, or
the burden of disease, can be thought of as a measurement of the gap
between current health status and an ideal health situation where
the entire population lives to an advanced age, free of disease and
disability. It allows comparison of the overall health and life expect-
ancy of different countries.
• National statistics stratified by gender: In 2015, DALYs lost to
CVD in women and men totalled ~28 million and ~36 million,
accounting for ~22% and ~24% of all DALYs lost across ESC
member countries (Figure 38A and B). Age-standardized data for
2015 show that across ESC member countries DALYs per
100000 people lost to IHD were consistently higher than
DALYs lost to stroke, as reflected by mean values for women
(1623 vs. 1040) and for men (3698 vs. 1560). Age-standardized
DALYs lost to IHD in women and men were notably high in
Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, and Ukraine and lowest in France. For
stroke, age-standardized DALYs lost in women and men were,
for both sexes, highest in Kyrgyzstan and lowest in Switzerland
(see Supplementary material online, Table S24).
• Time series data: Between 1990 and 2015 reductions in mean
age-standardized DALYs per 100000 people lost due to CVD
were recorded across ESC member countries for both women
(5759 to 3452) and men (9764 to 6326) (see Supplementary
material online, Table S25, Figure 39A and B).
• Stratification by national income status: For IHD in women and
men, there were a mean of 1004 and 2407 age-standardized
DALYs per 100000 people lost during 2015 in high-income
member countries compared with 2715 and 5977 in middle-
income member countries. The data for stroke in women and
men were 586 and 860 age-standardized DALYs per 100000
people lost in high-income member countries compared with
1841 and 2794 in middle income member countries (see
Supplementary material online, Table S24, Figure 40).
4.4 Commentary
The statistics recorded within the Atlas provide a timely reminder
that incident cardiovascular disease continues to increase across
nearly all European member countries of the ESC, despite declines
in cardiovascular mortality. This no doubt reflects population
growth and ageing because age-standardized data for men and
women show consistent declines in CVD prevalence across high-
income ESC member countries during the last 25 years. In the mid-
dle-income countries of the ESC, the pattern is different with no

clear evidence of decline during the same period. Indeed, just under
half of these middle-income countries recorded an increase in dis-
ease prevalence, with the inequalities in disease burden further
emphasized by a greater than three-fold excess of DALYs lost to
IHD in middle-income compared with high-income ESC member
countries. This is not only a health issue for the less prosperous
middle-income countries but also an economic issue, with the total
costs of CVD, direct and indirect, being greater than any other
diagnostic group.36–40 This presents the middle-income member
countries of the ESC with a clear economic imperative to develop
policies to protect their populations against the development and
progression of CVD. In many of these countries rates of smoking
and hypertension are very high (see chapter 3), presenting policy
makers with the same targets for prevention that have contributed
to the declines in CVD prevalence and mortality across many high-
income member countries. Addressing these targets at a national
level has cost implications that are inevitably more challenging for
less prosperous member countries. However, across these coun-
tries the age-standardized prevalence statistics are not always
closely associated with GDP and Russian Federation, for example,
despite its considerable national resources, has one of the highest
rates of CVD in the world. Commitment to the cause of tackling
CVD, therefore, is not simply a question of resource but also
requires sound health policies that are backed up by implementa-
tion strategies. This is often not achieved. Thus, while the
spread of smoking legislation across Europe, from West to East, is
now almost complete its enforcement is variable and in Armenia,
for example, the absence of any legal sanctions against those who
violate the smoking laws has made them ineffectual.41 Whether
this is contributing to Armenia’s inclusion among the minority of
member states where CVD prevalence is increasing is hard to say
but it illustrates the breakdown between policy and implementa-
tion
that
can
undermine
CVD
prevention.
Nevertheless,
declines in disease prevalence that seem established in many high-
income member countries are beginning to develop in some of
their middle income neighbours and if this trend continues the ben-
efits in terms of population health and national economies will be
substantial.
5. Cardiovascular health care
delivery
The declines in coronary mortality and non-fatal outcomes that have
been recorded in Western societies during the last 50 years,6,42 have
not always been shared in other parts of the world, including many
East European countries, the Russian republics, and China, where
mortality trends have been in the opposite direction.6,43 These
inequalities must in part reflect the adoption of Western life-styles in
many middle income countries, particularly tobacco smoking and cal-
orie consumption, but the unavailability of facilities for contemporary
investigation and interventional management of CVD also merits
consideration.1,44 Procedure and device costs are considerable and
challenge the delivery of guideline-recommended cardiovascular care
in many middle-income and developing countries.38,45 This is
reflected in substantial inequalities in the resources available for inva-
sive management of cardiovascular disease that the Atlas data
highlight in documenting national interventional facilities and cardio-
vascular procedure rates. In this review, we examine these data and
the inequalities between different ESC member countries as they
associate with national prosperity and impact on the delivery of
healthcare.
5.1 Cardiovascular specialists and
procedures
Data from the USA show that the specialist to population ratio
at county or state level bears little relation to health out-
comes.46,47 Indeed, while US specialist numbers are high, there is
no evidence that increasing them further will do anything other
than increase health care costs. Whether the same applies across
ESC member countries—where health care systems are often
very different – is unknown. The ESC Atlas and its data on car-
diac staffing, facilities, and outcomes provide an opportunity to
start examining this question.

5.1.1 Cardiologists and diagnostic angiography: European
Society of Cardiology Atlas
Data: Interventional cardiology infrastructure and proce-
dures, per million people; Data source: ESC Atlas of
Cardiology. Completeness: Europe 34/39; Non-European
former Russian Republics 5/9; E Med & N Africa 2/8; Year of
data: 2014.
• Infrastructure: The number of cardiologists per million people
averaged 86.3 (median 72.8) across the 41 ESC member coun-
tries that contributed data, ranging from <30 in Ireland and
Turkey to> 250 in Republic of Georgia and Greece. (see
Supplementary material online, Table S26, Figure 41).
• Service delivery: Coronary angiographic workload as reflected by
the number of coronary angiograms per million people per year
averaged 4122 across the ESC member countries ranging from
244 in Kyrgyzstan to 9117 in Austria (see Supplementary material
online, Table S26).
• Stratification by national income status: The number of cardiolo-
gists was similar in high-income compared with middle-income
member countries, averaging 86.3 and 86.1 per million people
in 2014 or the most recent available year. (see Supplementary
material online, Table S26, Figure 42). The numbers of coro-
nary angiograms, however, were higher in high-income com-
pared with middle-income countries, averaging 4916 vs. 2412
per million people per year (see Supplementary material
online, Table S26, Figure 43). Outliers among the middle-
income countries were Turkey and Bulgaria where more coro-
nary angiograms were performed than in many high-income
countries.
5.1.2 Intervention, percutaneous coronary intervention,
and transcatheter valve replacement: European Society
of Cardiology Atlas
Data: Interventional cardiology infrastructure and proce-
dures, per million people; Data source: ESC Atlas of
Cardiology. Completeness: Europe 34/39; Non-European
former Russian Republics 5/9; E Med & N Africa 2/8; Year of
data: 2014.
• Infrastructure: The number of interventional cardiologists per
million people averaged 11.8 across the 33 ESC member coun-
tries that contributed data, ranging from �3 in Republic of
Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, and Azerbaijan to >27 in Estonia and
Austria (see Supplementary material online, Table S26, Figure
44). As the number of interventional cardiologists increased
across ESC member countries so did the number of coronary
interventional centres, peaking in Bulgaria and Germany where,
for every million people, there were 6.6 and 6.0 interventional
centres, respectively, whereas in Kyrgyzstan, there was a total
of just 0.7 per million people (see Supplementary material
online, Table S26, Figure 45). The number of centres undertak-
ing transcatheter valve replacements showed similar variation
among the 34 ESC member countries that provided data, rang-
ing from none in Albania, Republic of Moldova, and U\kraine
to> 2 per million people in Belgium, Iceland, and Malta.
• Service delivery: Germany recorded the most coronary interven-
tional procedures with 3975 percutaneous coronary interven-
tions (PCIs) and 1452 primary PCIs per million people. At the
other end of the distribution was Kyrgyzstan undertaking 82 PCIs
and 27 primary PCIs per million people (see Supplementary mate
rial online, Table S26, Figure 46).
• Stratification by national income status: The number of interven-
tional cardiologists in high income countries averaged 14.7 per
million people compared with 7.4 per million people in middle-
income countries. Interventional centres in high-income countries
numbered 3.0 per million people compared with 2.5 per million
people in middle-income countries (see Supplementary material
online, Table S26, Figures 47 and 48). Associated with these infra-
structure differences was the performance of over twice as many
PCIs (2160 vs. 1051) and 40% more primary PCIs (527 vs. 375)
per million people in high-income compared with middle-income
countries, although again Turkey and Bulgaria were outliers in
performing more PCIs per million people (2709 and 3603) than
many high-income countries. (see Supplementary material online,
Table S26, Figures 49 and 50). Transcatheter valve replacement
infrastructure was also better developed in high-income ESC
member countries where there were more than five times as
many specialist centres per million people equipped to undertake
these procedures compared with middle-income countries (1.1
vs. 0.2 centres) (see Supplementary material online, Table S26,
Figure 51).

5.1.3 Electrophysiology, devices, and ablations: European
Society of Cardiology Atlas
Data: Interventional cardiology infrastructure and proce-
dures, per million people; Data source: ESC Atlas of
Cardiology. Completeness: Europe 34/39; Non-European
former Russian Republics 5/9; E Med & N Africa 2/8; Year of
data: 2014.
• Infrastructure: The number of electrophysiologists per million
people averaged 5.0 across the 26 member countries for which
data were available, ranging from <1 in Azerbaijan, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, and Romania to> 10 in Czech Republic, Greece,
Poland, and Sweden (see Supplementary material online, Table
S27, Figure 52).
• Service delivery: As the number of electrophysiologists per million
people increased across ESC member countries so did the num-
ber of electrophysiological centres (Table S27, Figures 53–55),
device implantations, and procedures (see Supplementary material
online, Table S27, Figures 56–59). Pacemaker implantation per mil-
lion people peaked at> 1000, in France, Italy, and Sweden, while
implantable cardioverter–defibrillator (ICD) implantation peaked
at >300 per million people in Czech Republic and Germany. At
the other end of the distribution with <25 pacemaker implana-
tions
per
million
people
were
Azerbaijan,
Bosnia
and
Herzegovina, and Kyrgyzstan, whereas Albania, Algeria, Morocco,
Republic of Kosovo, Republic of Moldova, and Ukraine implanted
<2 ICDs per million people. Ablation procedures showed
huge variation across ESC member countries, ranging from
<10 per million in Albania, Algeria, Kyrgyzstan, and Morocco
to> 600 per million in Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland (see
Supplementary material online, Table S27, Figures 56–59).
• Stratification by national income status: The number of electro-
physiologists per million people in high-income ESC member
countries averaged 6.5 compared with 1.5 in middle-income
countries, with a similar differential for pacemaker (742 vs. 153),
ICD (147 vs. 19), CRT-D (64 vs. 6), and CRT-P (30 vs. 7)

rial online, Table S27, Figures 60–62). It was the high-income ESC
member countries where the most ablation procedures were
performed, with an average five-fold higher rate compared with
middle-income countries (341 vs. 60 procedures per million (see
Supplementary material online, Table S27, Figure 63).
5.1.4 Cardiac surgery: European Society of Cardiology
Atlas
Data: Cardiac surgery infrastructure and procedures, per
million people, 2014. Data source: ESC Atlas of Cardiology.
Completeness: Europe 34/39; Non-European former Russian
Republics 6/9; E Med & N Africa 1/8. Year of data: 2014.
• Infrastructure: The number of cardiac surgeons per million peo-
ple averaged 10.3 across the 36 member states that provided
data, ranging from �4 in, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Romania,
TFYR Macedonia to >20 in Finland, Greece, and Sweden.
Similar differences in the number of cardiac surgical centres per
million people were recorded, ranging from �0.5 in Azerbaijan,
Kyrgyzstan, and Ukraine to> 2.5 in Belgium, Cyprus, Iceland,
and Turkey (see Supplementary material online, Table S28,
Figures 64 and 65).
• Service Delivery: Coronary bypass operations averaged 362 per
million across the ESC member countries that provided data,
ranging from <60 in Kyrgyzstan and Republic of Moldova
to> 600 in Iceland, Lithuania, Netherlands and Turkey (see
Supplementary material online, Table S28, Figure 66).
• Stratification by National Income Status: The number of cardiac
surgeons per million people in high income ESC member coun-
tries averaged 11.7 compared with 7.3 in middle income coun-
tries. Although the number of cardiac surgical centres was similar
(1.4 vs. 1.2 per million people) an average of over 35% more cor-
onary bypass operations were performed across high income
compared with middle income ESC member countries (396 vs.
291 per million people) (see Supplementary material online,
Table S28, Figures 67–69). Heart transplant procedures were
performed almost exclusively in high income ESC member coun-
tries where an average of 3.8 per million people underwent
transplantation compared with just 0.1 per million people in low
income countries (see Supplementary material online, Table S28,
Figure 70).
5.2 Commentary
In the absence of any evidence about what comprises optimal
specialist provision, it is perhaps inevitable that countries will
make their own choices as to how many cardiologists and cardiac
surgeons they require. These choices are affected, at least in part,
by national prosperity with a tendency towards greater specialist
provision in high income compared with middle-income ESC
member countries. The importance of financial muscle for cardio-
vascular healthcare delivery is further emphasized by the other
measures of cardiological and surgical activity documented in the
Atlas all of which incur variable, often considerable, expense that
tests resources available for health care in many middle-income
countries. Accordingly, it tends to be the more prosperous ESC
member countries where rates of costly health technologies, such
as cardiac catheterization and coronary bypass surgery, and the
number of specialist centres required to deliver them are greatest.
The Atlas confirms that these same ESC member countries where

facilities for contemporary treatment of coronary disease are best
developed are often those in which declines in coronary mortality
have been most pronounced.
The paradox of greater cardiological provision in those countries
where need is manifestly less emphasises the inequalities that,
together with hypertension and smoking, must contribute to the
continued imbalance in CVD mortality between high-income and
middle-income ESC member countries. However, the Atlas also
makes clear that economic resources are not the only driver for
delivery of equitable cardiovascular health care, some middle
income ESC member countries reporting rates for interventional
procedures and device implantations that match or exceed rates in
wealthier high-income member countries. Analyses of electrophy-
siological
activity
recorded
in
the
European
Heart
Rhythm
Association (EHRA) White book48 have come to similar conclu-
sions confirming that inequitable cardiovascular health care is not
an inevitable consequence of limited economic resource. The fail-

by policy makers to reorganize service delivery by prioritizing initia-
tives of proven value in other health care settings. Examples
include the development of primary PCI networks which in Poland
have been associated with substantial reductions in mortality of
patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction51 while
promoting an invasive strategy in non-ST-segment elevation myo-
cardial infarction which has had similar benefits in the UK.52 A
complex mix of societal, life style, and treatment factors interact to
drive coronary mortality and all need to be taken account of in
organizing national service provision.
6. Cardiovascular disease
mortality
Epidemiological transition has occurred at different rates across ESC
member countries during the last 50–100years as infectious disease
has given way to non-communicable diseases including CVD and can-
cer that are now the major causes of death. The epidemiology con-
tinues to evolve with age-adjusted cardiovascular mortality now in
steep decline in most of the high-income countries of Western
Europe with a similar but delayed pattern emerging in a number of

countries further east. Whether the epidemics of obesity and type
2 diabetes currently afflicting populations across Europe will halt
further declines in CVD mortality remains to be seen but at
present myocardial infarction and stroke continue to dominate
among causes of death. Recognition that these potentially lethal
cardiovascular disorders are largely preventable provides grounds
for optimism that the encouraging mortality trends in the high-
income countries of Western Europe will continue to spread east-
wards as inequalities in prevention and
treatment diminish.
Monitoring of these mortality trends and definition of the inequal-
ities between ESC member countries is a key function of the Atlas
that is now having a central role in benchmarking the ESC’s prog-
ress towards achieving its ambitious mission ‘to reduce the burden
of cardiovascular disease’ not only in its member countries but also
in nation states around the world.
6.1 Cardiovascular disease mortality
Data: T
otal numbers of deaths by cause, male, latest avail-
able year; WHO Mortality Database http://apps.who.int/
healthinfo/statistics/mortality/whodpms/;
Completeness:
Europe 37/39; Non-European former Russian Republics 9/9;
E Med & N Africa 1/8. Year of data: 2009–14.
In the high-income countries of Western Europe, the annual num-
ber of deaths from CVD declined between 1990 and 2013, but glob-
ally deaths increased by 41% despite a 39% decrease in age-specific
death rates. This increase was driven by a 55% increase in mortality
due to the aging of populations and a 25% increase due to population
growth.53 The data are a reminder that CVD will remain a global
threat as the world population grows and ages.

• National statistics: The latest available data show that CVD
accounted for over 3.8 million deaths each year, or 45% of all
deaths across ESC member countries. IHD was the leading
cause, responsible for 1.7 million deaths (20% of all deaths)
with stroke responsible for 970 391 deaths (11% of all
deaths). After CVD, cancer was the next most common cause
of death accounting for 1.9 million cases or 23% of all deaths
(see Supplementary material online, Table S29A and B, Figure
71A and B).
• Stratification by gender: Using the latest available data, the num-
ber of deaths due to CVD in ESC member countries was higher
in women (2.1 million) than in men (1.7 million). Cardiovascular
diesease also accounted for a larger proportion of all deaths in
women (49%) compared with men (40%). This gender difference
was driven largely by a greater number of women dying from
stroke and ‘other CVDs’ (all CVD deaths excluding deaths from
IHD and stroke). There were around 575000 stroke deaths
(13% of all deaths) in women, compared with 396000 (9%) in

men, and 658000 ‘other CVD’ deaths (15%) in women com-
pared with 516000 (12%) in men. In contrast, IHD mortality in
women (~854000 deaths, 20%) and men (~836000 deaths,
19%) were more comparable. Cancer, the second most common
cause of death across Europe, was responsible for just under 1.1
million deaths (25%) in men and just over 850000 deaths (20%)
in women.
• Stratification by national income status: The CVD mortality bur-
den was typically higher in middle income compared with high-
income ESC member countries (Figure 72). For instance, the

proportion of total deaths due to CVD ranged from 25% in
Israel to 75% in Ukraine among women and from 23% in
France to 60% in Bulgaria among men (see Supplementary mate
rial online, Tables S29A and B). However, among men in Israel
and 11 high-income countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia,
Spain, and the UK) cancer was the more common cause of
death. In women, there were only two countries (Israel and
Denmark), where the number of cancer deaths exceeded
deaths from CVD.

E Med & N Africa 1/8; Year of data: latest available from
2009–14.
Premature deaths are of interest since many are deemed to be
preventable through reduced exposure to behavioural risk factors
plus timely and effective treatment. There is no standard definition,
with what counts as ‘premature’ varying for different countries
according to average life expectancy at birth. Here, we employ two
definitions of premature mortality to reflect the range of life expect-
ancies across Europe: deaths before the age of 75 years and deaths
before the age of 65 years.
• National statistics: Although around 65% of all CVD deaths in
the member countries of the ESC occurred in individuals over
75 years, ~1.3 million people under 75, and ~ 635000 under 65,
died each year from CVD. This makes CVD the leading cause of
premature death, responsible for 35% of deaths under 75 years
and 29% of deaths under 65 years, compared with 29% (1.1 mil-
lion)
and
27%
(607000),
respectively,
from
cancer.
(see
Supplementary material online, Tables S30A and B and S31A and
B, Figures 73A and B and 74A and B).
• Stratification by age and gender: In contrast to deaths at all ages,
fewer women than men died prematurely from CVD in the
member countries of the ESC.
• Age <75 years: Across ESC member countries, CVD was the
most common cause of premature death among men <75 years,
but in women the numbers of deaths from CVD (~457000) and
cancer (~453000) were similar. CVD caused just over half as
many deaths in women compared with men (~457000 vs.
~834000), although the proportion of deaths caused by CVD
(34%) was the same in both genders. In both genders, IHD was
the leading single cause, responsible for ~205000 deaths (16%)
in women and ~435000 deaths (18%) in men. Stroke was the
second most common cause of death (~132000 deaths, 10%) in
women and the third most common in men (~176000 deaths,
7%) after IHD and lung cancer (see Supplementary material
online, Tables S30A and B).
• Age <65 years: Across ESC member countries, CVD was the
most common cause of premature death among men <65 years,
but in women cancer was more common being responsible for
around 11% more deaths. CVD caused fewer deaths in women
compared with men (~176 000 vs. ~458000). IHD was the
most common single cause, accounting for ~72000 deaths (10%)
in women and ~239000 deaths (16%) in men. Stroke, joint with
breast cancer, was the second most common cause of death in
women (~48000, 7%), and the third most common in men
(~86000 6%), after IHD and lung cancer (see Supplementary
material online, Tables S31A and B).
• Stratification by national income status: It has been the high-
income ESC member countries where cancer has begun to take
over from CVD as the leading cause of premature death. In
Polish women aged <75 years, for example, cancer caused
around 60% more deaths than CVD, whereas in Croatian men it
caused around 20%
more deaths than CVD. In people
<65 years, cancer was yet more common and in a majority of
ESC member countries, particularly high income countries,
caused more premature deaths than CVD (see Supplementary
material online, Tables S30A and B and S31A and B, Figures 75
and 76).
6.3 Potential years of life lost to
cardiovascular disease
Data: Potential years of life lost (PYLL) by cause, by sex, lat-
est available year; Data source: European WHO Mortality
Database http://apps.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/mortality/
whodpms/; Completeness: Eur-ope 37/39; Non-European
former Russian Republics 9/9; E Med & N Africa 1/8; Year of
data: latest between 2007 and 2014.
The potential years of life lost (PYLL) provides another measure of
premature mortality and is calculated by summing up deaths occur-
ring at each age and multiplying this by the number of remaining years
to live up to a selected age limit (75 years for the data presented
here). In this way, PYLL adds greater weight to the deaths occurring
at younger ages.
• Cardiovascular disease makes a considerable yet variable contri-
bution to PYLL in the member countries of the ESC. Among
men,
latest
available
data
(2007–14)
showed
that
CVD
accounted for between 11% of PYLL in France and 39% of PYLL
in Bulgaria. Among women, the contribution ranged from 7% in
Iceland, Israel and Luxembourg to 33% in Bulgaria. The contribu-
tion of CVD to PYLL is lower in high income than middle income
countries both for women (13% vs. 23%) and for men (20% vs.
27%) (see Supplementary material online, Table S32).

Data:
Age-standardized
mortality

Age-standardization adjusts crude mortality rates to remove the
influence of different population age structures, and hence allows
more meaningful comparisons to be made between countries and
over time. (It should be noted that the mortality rates presented
here are standardized for population age structure only. Differences
between countries and over time in migration and other aspects of
population composition may still confound comparisons.)

by
gender: The average age-
standardized mortality rates for IHD across ESC member coun-
tries (using data from 2014) were 241 per 100000 in women
and 384 per 100000 in men. Using the latest available data, the
countries with the highest rates were Belarus, Kyrgyzstan,
Republic of Moldova, Russian Federation, and Ukraine with rates
of >500 for women and >800 for men. At the other end of the
spectrum with the lowest rates were France, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain where rates were <60 in
women
and
<120
in
men
per
100000
people
(see
Supplementary material online, Table S33). Age-standardized
stroke mortality (latest available data 2014), averaged across ESC
member countries, was similar between women and men (133
and 173 per 100000 people). For individual countries, rates
ranged from <55 per 100000 women and �60 per 100000
men in France, Israel, Luxembourg, and Switzerland (as well as
women in Spain) to> 300 per 100000 people for both sexes in
Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, Russian Federation, and TFYR Macedonia
(also men in Republic of Moldova) (see Supplementary material
online, Table S34). Trends for IHD and stroke were similar
among people below 65years of age (see Supplementary material
online, Tables S35 and 36).
• Temporal changes by national income status: Complete preva-
lence data for IHD mortality across three time periods between
1985 and 2014 were available for 38 ESC member countries.
During that period, the average age-standardized mortality

declined from 374 to 209 deaths per 100000 in women and
from 586 to 339 deaths per 100000 in men (see Supplementary
material online, Table S37, Figure 77A and B). All of the 27 high-
income countries for which data were available recorded a
decline in mortality, averaging 286 to 129 deaths per 100000 in
women and 508 to 227 deaths per 100000 in men. In middle-
income countries, the average mortality also declined during this
period in both women (591 to 405 deaths per 100000) and
men (779 to 614 deaths per 100000). At a national level, how-
ever, the pattern was inconsistent and while many countries
showed
variable
reductions
in
mortality,
it
increased
in
Kyrgyzstan and Bosnia and Herzegovina in both women and men
and also in men from Ukraine (see Supplementary material
online, Table S37). There have been similar trends in age-
standardized stroke mortality, with steady declines occurring
since the 1980s in most high-income ESC member countries and
more
recent
declines
in
middle-income
countries
(see
Supplementary material online, Table S34). Trends in premature
(<65years) IHD and stroke mortality have also been similar, with
consistent declines in the high income member countries of the
ESC, and more volatile trends in middle income countries.
6.5 Cardiovascular disease mortality and
national economic measures
Data:
Age-standardized
mortality
rates
(deaths
per
100 000) from IHD/stroke, and GDP per capita in US$
[purchasing power parity (PPP)]; Data source: European
WHO Mortality Database http://apps.who.int/healthinfo/
statistics/mortality/whodpms/ and WB (http://data.world
bank.org/indicator); Completeness: Europe 37/39; Non-
European former Russian Republics 9/9; E Med & N Africa
1/8. Year of data: latest between 2007 and 2014.
• Mortality and GDP: Across all ESC member countries there was
a negative association between age-standardized CVD mortality
rates and GDP per capita adjusted for PPP although we make no
attempt to infer causal pathways. For example, Luxembourg,
which has the highest per capita GDP in Europe, had the seventh
lowest IHD death rate among men, while the third highest IHD
death rate in men was found in Kyrgyzstan, the poorest European
country (Figure 78). There were exceptions: Russian Federation in
particular stood out as a country with a relatively high IHD death
rate (790 deaths/100000) for its level of economic development
(GDP per capita US$25 636). In general, the negative relationship
was clear and was consistent for women and men and for prema-
ture (<65years) as well as total death rates.
• Mortality and total health expenditure: The total health expendi-
ture per capita is a more health service specific economic indica-
tor than GDP but like GDP showed a negative association with
age-standardized CVD mortality rates across ESC member coun-
tries. Data for men in Figure 78 show that high spending countries
like Switzerland, Norway, and Luxembourg enjoy IHD mortality
rates among the lowest in Europe, while Kyrgyzstan, which spent
least on health of any ESC member country, had the third highest
IHD mortality rate (Figure 79). The negative association was con-
sistent for men and women and for premature (<65 years) as
well as total death rates (not shown). However, this relationship
was not uniform across the continent. For example, in Russian
Federation, the death rate from stroke in men was more than
four times that in Estonia despite similar total health expenditure
(US$1423 and $1453 per capita respectively).
• Mortality and relative health expenditure: The association
between CVD mortality rates and total health expenditure as a
proportion of GDP was also negative but was noticeably weaker
than that with GDP per capita or with total health expenditure
per capita. For a given proportion of GDP spent on health,
European country death rates from IHD and stroke varied
widely. Kyrgyzstan and Cyprus both spent approximately 7% of
GDP on health, yet of all European countries Kyrgyzstan had the
highest death rate from stroke in women <65 years and Cyprus
had the joint second lowest. Similar weak, negative associations
with health expenditure were seen for all cause and IHD mortal-
ity in men (not shown).
6.6 Commentary
The statistics recorded within the Atlas suggest that the steep
declines in CVD mortality across high-income European countries
during the last 50 years are now beginning to become established in
many middle-income countries. However, huge inequalities persist
with CVD accounting for >50% of all deaths in many middle-income
countries compared with <30% in the high income countries of
Western Europe. Declines in CVD mortality have been driven largely
by reductions in the numbers of people presenting with myocardial
infarction and stroke, with health gains, particularly in the more pros-
perous countries of Western Europe, tending to offset the effects of
population ageing and growth.53 The erosion of these health gains by
the obesity epidemic and type 2 diabetes, however, is a tragedy wait-
ing to happen and already there are concerns about plateauing of car-
diovascular mortality rates in younger adults.54
The Atlas data confirm that more women than men—and a
greater proportion of women than men—are dying from CVD.
Indeed, while CVD remains the most common cause of death across
all ESC member countries, cancer has now overtaken CVD as the
most common cause of death among men in a number of high
income ESC member countries. The same is true for women
aged < 65 years for whom cancer is now the most common cause of
death in countries across Europe. In these younger women, however,
deaths from CVD continue to dwarf deaths from breast cancer. Most
of these CVD deaths in young women are preventable through mod-
ification of risk factors,20 prompting recent comment that ‘if the effort
put into the detection of breast cancer could be matched in protect-
ing young women against CVD, particularly AMI and stroke, many
more lives would probably be saved’.7
Analysis of age-standardized mortality rates for IHD confirms the
inequalities between high and middle income ESC member countries.
These are not trivial with rates in Ukrainian men and women, for
example, respectively 14 and 23 times greater than in France.
Importantly, the data begin to show evidence of consistent declines
in mortality rates across nearly all of the middle-income member
countries of the ESC since the start of the new millennium. These
encouraging trends need reinforcement by policy initiatives such as
programmes to tackle hypertension and dyslipidaemia that have been
successfully applied in many countries and have probably contributed
as much, if not more, to declining CVD mortality, as the development
of specialist treatments and interventions in patients with established
disease.1
Associations in the Atlas between national CVD mortality rates
and economic measures are not unexpected and must reflect, at least
in part, the socio-economic gradients in disease incidence and

mortality that others have reported.55,56 However, economic
resources are not the only drivers of health outcomes, as evidenced
by ‘amenable mortality’ in the USA which, despite huge and increas-
ing health expenditure, is substantially higher compared with many
European countries.57 Atlas data too show that within Europe rela-
tions between health expenditure and cardiovascular outcomes are
variable, the Russian Federation, for example, reporting a four-fold
higher death rate for stroke compared with Estonia despite similar
per capita health expenditure. It needs emphasizing, therefore, that
inequitable health outcomes are not an inevitable consequence of
limited economic resource.

Disclaimer: The main purpose of the Atlas is to map the status of
the ESC member countries from a cardiovascular point of view. Such
data can be useful to provide a broad profile and to identify inequal-
ities and disparities between middle-income and high-income ESC
countries to draw attention to the need for investing more resources
into proper implementation of guidelines and into increasing the
standards of CVD care. Although sources of data are clearly refer-
enced throughout the report, the summaries, interpretations, and
conclusions are those of the authors. The ESC Atlas comprises
national level data coming from a variety of different sources that
have been processed using different methods such that data quality is
variable. The ESC countries exhibit different socio-economic, risk,
and disease prevalence dynamics and hence the data contained in the
present publication should be used responsibly and with caution.
