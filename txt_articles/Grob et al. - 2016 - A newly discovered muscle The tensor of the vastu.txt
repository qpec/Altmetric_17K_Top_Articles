The quadriceps femoris is traditionally described as a muscle group com-
posed of the rectus femoris and the three vasti. However, clinical experience
and investigations of anatomical specimens are not consistent with the text-
book description. We have found a second tensor-like muscle between the
vastus lateralis (VL) and the vastus intermedius (VI), hereafter named the
tensor VI (TVI). The aim of this study was to clarify whether this intervening
muscle was a variation of the VL or the VI, or a separate head of the exten-
sor apparatus. Twenty-six cadaveric lower limbs were investigated. The
architecture of the quadriceps femoris was examined with special attention
to innervation and vascularization patterns. All muscle components were
traced from origin to insertion and their affiliations were determined. A TVI
was found in all dissections. It was supplied by independent muscular and
vascular branches of the femoral nerve and lateral circumflex femoral artery.
Further distally, the TVI combined with an aponeurosis merging separately
into the quadriceps tendon and inserting on the medial aspect of the patella.
Four morphological types of TVI were distinguished: Independent-type (11/
26), VI-type (6/26), VL-type (5/26), and Common-type (4/26). This study
demonstrated that the quadriceps femoris is architecturally different from
previous descriptions: there is an additional muscle belly between the VI and
VL, which cannot be clearly assigned to the former or the latter. Distal expo-
sure shows that this muscle belly becomes its own aponeurosis, which con-
tinues distally as part of the quadriceps tendon.
Key words: quadriceps femorismuscle group; quadriceps tendon; tensor vastus

INTRODUCTION
The quadriceps femoris is traditionally described as
a muscle composed of the rectus femoris and the
three vasti, the lateralis, intermedius and medialis,
which arise independently and blend into the common
quadriceps tendon (Putz and Papst, 2008; Platzer
et al., 2010; Sch€
unke et al. 2014; Paternoster
, 2012).
However, clinical experience and anatomical studies
do not confirm textbook descriptions of the vastus lat-
eralis (VL) and intermedius (VI) muscles. After careful

 anatomical dissection of the muscle bellies we found
an additional muscle between the VL and VI, hereafter
named the tensor VI (TVI), which cannot be clearly
assigned to the either of those muscles.
In a cadaver study, Golland et al. investigated the
gross morphology of the VL with regard to fusion
between adjacent muscles. They found a separate
muscle belly arising from the anterior aspect of the
upper femoral shaft in 29% of thighs (Golland et al.,
1986). Another study revealed an additional fleshy
lamella in the distal part between the VL and the VI in
36% (Willan et al., 1990).
Subdivision of the VL into various muscle bellies is
logical in view of its innervation pattern. It is supplied by
several muscle branches of the femoral nerve, which in
turn can be divided into two parts (Patil et al., 2007;
Becker et al., 2010). According to recently published
anatomical observations, the proximal-ventral aspects
of the bellies of the VL and VI are supplied by numerous
muscle branches of the femoral nerve (F), and by
branches of the lateral circumflex femoral artery and
vein (LCFA and LCFV) (Grob et al., 2015). This creates
the impression that the TVI belongs to the VL. However,
distal anatomical exposure revealed that this muscle
belly has a separate aponeurotic tendon, closely associ-
ated with the aponeurosis of the VI, which joins the
quadriceps tendon distally.
The aim of the following anatomical study was to
clarify, in terms of muscle innervation, whether the
TVI was a variation of the VL or the VI, or a separate
head of the extensor apparatus of the knee joint.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Twenty-six lower limbs of 16 embalmed cadavers,
nine
males
(six
paired
and
three
unpaired)
and
seven females (four paired and three unpaired), were
investigated by macro-dissection. The bodies were
obtained from the institutional body donation program
(http://www.anatom.uzh.ch/Bodydonation.html)
fol-
lowing the ethical guidelines “On the use of cadavers
and parts of cadavers in medical research and for pre-,
post-grad
and
continued
education
and
research
with human subjects” by the Academy of Medical Sci-
ences (SAMS). All lower limbs were embalmed in a
formalin-based solution. The limbs of four specimens
were cut transversely in the middle third of the thigh
after dissection. The thighs were examined using a
standardized dissection protocol. Each lower limb
was placed supine on a dissection table. The hip joint
was
approached
from
the
anterior
aspect.
The
ascending branch of the LCFA was identified and
traced medially. Following resection of the joint cap-
sule, the proximal margins of the muscle bellies of
the VL and VI were located. The femoral nerve was
located proximal to the inguinal ligament, then dis-
sected and traced distally. All muscle branches of the
femoral nerve to the sartorius and the rectus femoris
were identified. For better access, these muscles
were transected distally and lifted proximally. All
muscle branches of the femoral nerve and all vessels
to the quadriceps femoris were carefully dissected.
The
architecture
of
the
quadriceps
femoris
was
examined to confirm its anatomy, with special atten-
tion to the innervation pattern. Additional muscle bel-
lies were sought. All muscle bellies in the area of the
VL and VI were traced from their origin to their inser-
tion and their affiliations were determined. An MRI of
the quadriceps femoris was also studied to confirm
the anatomical findings. This is illustrated by a single
case in this article.
RESULTS
In all dissections (n 5 26), a separately innervated
TVI muscle belly was found between the muscle fas-
cias of the VL and the VI (Fig. 1). Further distally, the
TVI combined into a broad and flat aponeurosis merg-
ing into one of the deep layers of the quadriceps ten-
don.
In
22/26
cases,
the
TVI
could
be
clearly
separated in the proximal aspect from the muscle bel-
lies of the VI and VL. In the remaining 4/26 cases, no
clear proximal separation was possible.
All three muscles—the VL, the TVI, and the VI—
presented a common, hardly-divisible origin between
the
intertrochanteric
line
and
greater
trochanter
(Common-type) (Fig. 2). In 5/26, two or more smaller
intervening muscle lamellae were also found (Fig. 2).
Further distally, at the junction into the broad tendi-
nous portion, the TVI was always adjacent to, and
often integrated into, the aponeurosis of the VI. Cov-
ering the aponeurosis of the VI, the aponeurosis of
the TVI reached the distal aspect of the quadriceps
femoris. The aponeurosis of the VI could hardly be
distinguished from that of the TVI at first glance
(Figs. 3 and 4).
However, the tendon of the TVI could easily be sep-
arated from both the VI and VL in 42% (n 5 11)
(Independent-type); the aponeurosis of the TVI was
inseparable from that of the VI in 23% (n 5 6) (VI-
type), and could be separated from the VI but not the
VL in 19% (n 5 5) (VL-type) (Fig. 2). In four paired
specimens, where both sides were dissected, the TVI
appeared identically on both sides of the body. In the
remaining six paired specimens, different types of TVI
were found on opposite sides. The aponeurosis of the
TVI consistently changed its course; running laterally
in the mid-third of the thigh, it moved ventrally
shortly before its point of entry in the quadriceps ten-
don (Figs. 5 and 8). In the distal aspect, the three
layers originating from the VI, the TVI, and the VL
could be clearly isolated in all cases. The anatomical
finding of the TVI muscle and its aponeurotic tendon
was also confirmed in a MRI cross section (Figs. 6
and 7).
The pattern of quadriceps tendon layers toward the
proximal muscular parts was always identical: the VI
was the deepest layer, the TVI formed the deep por-
tion of the middle layer, and the VL made up the
superficial portion of the middle layer. The rectus
femoris always formed the most superficial layer of
the quadriceps tendon. The insertion of the TVI was at
the medial aspect of the patellar base (Fig. 8). In
three cases the distal aponeurosis of the TVI became
narrow further distally (<3 cm) and continued as a
tendon-like structure
laterally and dorsally
in the
2

 intermuscular septum. In one case this tendon ended
in the broad aponeurosis of the VI, which was itself
divided in the distal aspect. Instead of the TVI, the lat-
eral portion of the VI aponeurosis merged into the
middle layer of the quadriceps tendon.
At the site of origin of the TVI, the anterior aspect of
the greater trochanter, fibers of the TVI spread into the
insertion of the gluteus minimus (Fig. 1). From the dor-
sal aspect, the TVI always originated together with the
VL and the VI (i.e., at the lateral lip of the linea aspera).
The TVI was very variable in size (Figs. 1 and 9).
Nerve branches to the VL, TVI, and lateral portions
of the VI originated from the same lateral deep divi-
sion of the femoral nerve (Fig. 9). The VL, TVI, and VI
could be divided only after the neurovascular struc-
tures were carefully traced. The TVI was always inner-
vated proximally by multiple short branches in a very
constricted space. However, in the deeper aspect, all
the muscle branches supplying the TVI had terminal
ramifications to the lateral portions of the VI. The TVI
was vascularized separately from the VL through indi-
vidual branches of the transverse branches of the
LCFA and side branches of the ascending branch of
the LCFA.
DISCUSSION
The
quadriceps
femoris
is
one
of
the
most
extensively-studied
muscle
groups
in
the
human
body. There have been many clinical, anatomical, and
biomechanical accounts of this muscle in recent years
(Zeiss et al., 1992; Shelburne and Pandy, 1997;
Willan et al., 2002; Blemker and Delp, 2006; Waligora
et al., 2009; Pasta et al., 2010; Becker et al., 2010).
Despite numerous descriptions in the literature, an
intermediate muscle between the VL and the VI has
been given little attention thus far(Testut, 1884; Le
Double, 1897; Willan et al., 2002; Pabst, 2008; Moore
et al., 2014;). There could be several reasons for this.
1. The muscle bellies of the VL, the TVI, and the
VI are very close to each other in the proximal
thigh and are covered with a complex network
of vessels and nerves.
2. The TVI originates at a site rarely seen in surgi-
cal
routine.
Therefore,
the
surgeon
remains
unaware of the specific anatomical features of
this region.
3. Further proximally, the TVI continues into an
aponeurosis that is very close to the VI but is
then separate at the level of the quadriceps ten-
don. Thus, in a cross-section of the thigh, the
aponeurosis of the TVI is not seen as a muscle
but merely as a fascial layer or an intermuscular
septum. However
, knowing that the TVI exists,
one
can
distinguish
an
aponeurotic
sheet
between the medial aponeurosis of the VL and
the lateral aponeurosis of the VI (Figs. 6 and 7).
4. The morphology of the TVI differs among indi-
viduals (Fig. 2).

into a broad aponeurosis (2) becoming a tendinous struc-
ture (3) at the level of the quadriceps tendon. GM, glu-

very variable. In contrast to Figure 9, the muscle belly of
the TVI in this specimen is proximally larger than that of
the VL (black arrows). The origin of the TVI is more proxi-
mal than that of the VL.

The schematic drawings show the different
types of the TVI and its variations with respect to interac-
tions with the VI and VL. In 42%, the aponeurosis and
muscle belly of the TVI could be clearly distinguished
from the aponeuroses of VI and VL (Independent-type,
see also Fig. 1). In 23% (n 5 6), the aponeurosis of the
TVI passed inseparably into the aponeurosis of the VI (VI-
type) and in 19% (n 5 5), it could be separated from the
VI but not from the VL (VL-type). In 15%, the VL, TVI,
and VI presented
a common, hardly-divisible origin
between the intertrochanteric line and the greater tro-
chanter (Common-type). In five cases there were two or
more smaller intervening muscle lamellae of the TVI.

The TVI merges into a broad aponeurosis that runs adja-
cent to the VI (see also Fig. 6). To some extent the apo-
neurosis of the TVI is separate from the aponeuroses of
the VI and VL. In the dorsal aspect of the thigh the three
muscles—VL, TVI, and VI—join (red arrows) and have a
common origin at the lateral lip of the linea aspera of the
femur.

VL, VM, and rectus femoris. The green pin indicates the
insertion of the quadriceps tendon at the patella. In the

 To our knowledge, the TVI has not been described
or illustrated in any textbook of anatomy. The VL is
generally shown as a muscle with a single belly, sepa-
rated from the VI by a intermuscular septum (Pabst,
2008; Platzer et al., 2010; Sch€
unke et al., 2014;
Moore et al., 2014). However, some authors have
reported variable fusion between the VL and the adja-
cent musculature (Henle, 1880; Krause, 1880; Le
Double, 1897). Golland et al. found a separate muscle
belly of the VL arising from the anterior aspect of the
upper femoral shaft in 29% of dissected thighs (Gol-
land et al., 1986). They reported that the belly usually
contributes to a tendinous lamina distally, but occa-
sionally fuses with the VI. In another cadaver study,
Willan et al. found consistent results (Willan et al.,
1990) among 40 cadavers, reporting an additional
muscle lamina between the VL and the VI in 36%.
Two muscle bellies of the VL have also been reported
by
other
authors
(Krause,
1880;
Testut,
1884;
Dwight, 1887; Holyoke, 1987).
Henle described the VL as a multi-layered muscle
with superficial and deep portions (Henle, 1880). The

 regular occurrence of two neurovascular sources, as
described for the VL, also suggests more than one
muscle belly (Frohse and Fr€
ankel, 1913; Patil et al.,
2007; Becker et al., 2010). Becker and coworkers
described the VL as a muscle consisting of four dis-
tinct anatomical partitions, named the central, super-
ficial
proximal,
deep
proximal
and
deep
distal
portions. In seven of 10 specimens, partitioning was
enhanced by an areolar fascial plane between the cen-
tral and the deep distal partitions (Becker et al.,
2010). Labb�
e reported a symptomatic, progressive
restriction of the knee joint in a 9-year-old girl due to
an accessory VI. Its tendon and muscle belly were
completely separated from the other components of
the extensor apparatus (Labb�
e et al., 2011). Yet other
authors have referred to complex fusion between the
VL and the VI (Engstrom et al., 1991; Willan et al.,
2002; Becker et al., 2009). Frohse and coworkers did
not distinguish between the VL and VI, suggesting
instead that the extensor apparatus of the knee con-
sists of only three muscle heads (M. triceps femoris)
(Frohse and Fr€
ankel, 1913). Despite these anatomical
findings, the possibility of a separate intermediate
muscle arising proximally between the bellies of the
VL and the VI and inserting separately at the medial
aspect of the patellar base has not previously been
explored.
The deep parts of the quadriceps femoris do not
vary much among individuals. However, besides the
bilaminar
structure
of
the
vasti,
Bergman
and
coworkers mention that a slip (rectus accessorius) can
arise from a tendon at the edge of the acetabulum
and insert into the ventral edge of the VL (Bergman,
2015). Bergman et al. refer to Grubers’ observations
between 1856 and 1866 concerning a rectus femoris
accessorius found in three specimens. In all three, the
rectus femoris accessorius arose with a long tendon
lateral to the main rectus femoris origin from the
anterior inferior iliac spine and inserted into the fleshy
vastus
externus
(VL)
(Gruber,
1888).
This
was
not observed in the present study. The TVI always
originated at the anterior aspect of the greater tro-
chanter distal to the intertrochanteric line.
In contrast to previous studies, we found at least
one additional muscle belly between the VL and the
VI. In many cases, the individual muscle bellies could
be distinguished only after the neurovascular struc-
tures were traced. The supply to the VL was clearly

joint capsule is removed and the neck of the femur (large
red pin) is visible. The transected rectus femoris is held
medially. The proximal aspects of the VL, the TVI, and the
VI are shown. The TVI lamella lies between the muscle
lamellae of the VL and VI. All these muscles are inner-
vated by branches of the same lateral division of the fem-
oral nerve. In order to visualize the nerve branches
better, the terminal branches of the lateral circumflex
femoral artery and vein are transected (a, t, and d:
ascending, transverse and descending branches). Gm
gluteus minimus, GM gluteus medius, T Tensor fasciae
latae. The size of the TVI is very variable. In contrast to
Figure 1, the muscle belly of the TVI in this specimen is
comparable in size to that of the VL (black arrows). The
origin of the TVI is located at the same level (at the
greater trochanter) as that of the VL. The TVI merges into
a broad aponeurosis that runs adjacent to the VI (see also
Fig. 3). The blue arrow indicates the point where the TVI
becomes adjacent to the VI.

 delineated, in contrast to the TVI and the VI. The
main part of the VL was consistently supplied by mus-
cular branches that ran together with the descending
branch of the LCFA. In contrast, the neurovascular
supply to the TVI consisted of shorter proximal femo-
ral nerve branches and vessels of the transverse or
ascending branch of the LCFA. The same neurovascu-
lar structures also supplied lateral portions of the VI,
which confirms that the TVI cannot be clearly assigned
to the VL.
Over the years, anatomical dissections of the quad-
riceps femoris have mainly focused on the special fea-
tures of the extensor apparatus in the distal region
(Hollinshead, 1969; Zeiss et al., 1992; Hubbard et al.,
1997; Andrikoula et al., 2006; Waligora et al., 2009).
It has been suggested that the VL is composed of two
parts: VL obliquus (VLO) and VL longus (VLL) (Hallisey
et al., 1987). These inferences were based on the
pennation angles of the superficial fascicles only. No
differences in respect of innervation pattern or blood
supply have been reported. The VLO and VLL were
not separately innervated.
Many authors have tried to decipher the architec-
ture of the quadriceps tendon (Hollinshead, 1969; Ful-
kerson, 2004; Waligora et al., 2009). In this regard,
the TVI should be considered a separate muscle belly.
This study has demonstrated that it has its own layer
in the middle layer of the quadriceps tendon. The
muscle
portions
of
the
quadriceps
femoris
are
arranged distally such that the individual layers come
together and lie above each other like the layers of an
onion. In the proximal two thirds of the muscle group
the external and internal layers lie adjacent to each
other
. However, at the level of the quadriceps tendon,
the external layers lie above the inner ones. This
explains why the quadriceps tendon is described as
many-layered when observed in transverse section
(Zeiss et al., 1992; Waligora et al., 2009).
In view of its course from the anterolateral aspect
of the greater trochanter to the medial base of the
patella, the TVI appears to be significant in controlling
the motion of the patella. Its fibers entering the mid-
dle layer of the quadriceps tendon from the oblique
lateral aspect counteract the forces of the medial
fibers of the VM. The steering function of this muscle
is also suggested by its rich innervation.
Alternatively, since the aponeurosis of the TVI is in
close contact or fused with that of the VI over a long
distance, the TVI appears to exert tension on the VI
aponeurosis and medialize the action of the VI. Hence,
the TVI seems to be a type of “tensor of the VI.” In
contrast to the tensor fasciae latae, it is fixed to the
corresponding medial muscle layer (Figs. 3 and 10).
In our opinion the TVI fulfils all criteria for an inde-
pendent
muscle.
It
is
innervated
by
independent
branches of the femoral nerve and is vascularized
through separate muscle branches. Furthermore, it
has a defined origin at the anterior aspect of the
greater trochanter and inserts in the middle layer of
the quadriceps tendon at the medial patellar base.
Despite its variable connections with the adjacent
muscles in the proximal aspect of the thigh, the TVI,
VL, and VI can always be clearly distinguished in the
distal aspect.
To date, the TVI has been attributed to the VL.
Indeed, the affiliation of the TVI to the VL is confirmed
by the close relationship of the two muscle heads in
the proximal aspect. However, the course and function
of the TVI and its neurovascular supply suggest that it
is aligned more with the VI than the VL. Yet, when the
nerves supplying the quadriceps femoris are viewed
as a whole, the TVI should be considered together
with the VL and the lateral portion of the VI as a func-
tional unit. All three lamellar muscles are closely
related and are supplied by the same deep lateral divi-
sion of the femoral nerve.
The morphology of the TVI shows intra- and inter-
individual differences. There are individual variations
in respect of the degree of fusion between the muscle
bellies of the VL and the VI (Willan et al., 2002).
These connections are also found between the layers
of the VI and the TVI, as well as the TVI and the VL.
On the basis of this study it is not clear whether physi-
cal exercise or pathological conditions are implicated
in these individual differences.

study, an additional TVI (1, red) can be found between
the VL and VI. This muscle could act as a second tensor
(in addition to the tensor fasciae latae).

 Interpreting the TVI as an independent muscle and
understanding its role within the extensor mechanism
would change our understanding of the complex archi-
tecture and function of the extensor apparatus of the
knee
joint
as
a
whole.
The
present
anatomical
description is by no means a comprehensive report on
the TVI. Further work should combine these anatomi-
cal findings with advanced imaging techniques. If the
muscle bellies of the quadriceps could be distin-
guished by modern imaging procedures, exercise- or
disease-related
differences
between
the
individual
muscles could be identified.
