Muscles are the actuators that drive human movement. However, despite many decades of
work, we still cannot readily assess the forces that muscles transmit during human move-
ment. Direct measurements of muscle–tendon loads are invasive and modeling approaches
require many assumptions. Here, we introduce a non-invasive approach to assess tendon
loads by tracking vibrational behavior. We first show that the speed of shear wave propa-
gation in tendon increases with the square root of axial stress. We then introduce a
remarkably simple shear wave tensiometer that uses micron-scale taps and skin-mounted
accelerometers to track tendon wave speeds in vivo. Tendon wave speeds are shown to
modulate in phase with active joint torques during isometric exertions, walking, and running.
The capacity to non-invasively assess muscle–tendon loading can provide new insights into
the motor control and biomechanics underlying movement, and could lead to enhanced
clinical treatment of musculoskeletal injuries and diseases.

here has long been a fascination with understanding the
muscle forces that actuate human movement. In the
seventeenth century, Giovanni Borelli analyzed muscle
lever systems and deduced that the muscle forces acting within
the body must be considerably larger than the external forces
acting on the body1. Today, we can easily measure external forces
during movement. However, we still cannot readily assess the
underlying muscle–tendon forces that generate human move-
ment. Animal studies have used surgically implanted force sen-
sors to gain insights into the control and mechanics of
muscle–tendon units. However, the invasiveness of implanted
sensors limits their usefulness for human studies2–4.
There have been prior attempts to non-invasively track muscle
and tendon forces based on wave propagation measures. For
example, it has been shown that the speed of axial sound waves
(compression waves) in tendon varies with loading during
movement5. Sound wave propagation is governed by tissue
elasticity though, such that sound wave speed primarily provides
a metric of tissue stiffness rather than force5. Shear wave speed
has also been shown to increase with load in muscle6–9 and
tendon10,11. However, this dependency is generally attributed to a
strain-stiffening increase in the tissue’s shear modulus12. Further,
current ultrasonic shear wave measurement systems lack the
range and temporal resolution for tracking tissue wave speeds
during dynamic movement.
This work introduces a new approach to track and interpret
tendon shear wave speeds during dynamic movement. We first
present a tensioned beam model and ex vivo measurements
showing that shear wave propagation speed in tendon depends
primarily on axial stress at physiological loads. This phenomenon
is akin to the tension-dependent vibration frequencies of guitar
strings. We then show that in vivo tendon wave speeds can be
dynamically tracked using a remarkably simple shear wave ten-
siometer, consisting of a skin-mounted tapping device and min-
iature accelerometers. Lower extremity tendon wave speeds are
shown to vary closely with joint kinetics during active exertions,
and also detect phases of passive tendon tensioning which have
previously only been detected with invasive sensors13. We envi-
sion numerous uses of the technology for fundamentally inves-
tigating the motor control and tissue mechanics underlying
normal movement. This technical advance can also address many
important
applications spanning
orthopedics,
rehabilitation,
ergonomics, and sports.
Results
Model of shear wave propagation in a tensioned tendon. We
model tendon as a tensioned Timoshenko beam14 exhibiting
locally linear elastic behavior. At high vibration frequencies, shear
deformation is dominant and the equation of motion for incre-
mental transverse deflection, w, is:
ρ ∂2w
∂t2 ¼ k′μ þ σ
ð
Þ ∂2w
∂x2 ;
ð1Þ
where ρ is the effective density of the material, k’ ( < 1.0) is the
shear correction factor15 which accounts for the shape of the
cross-section, and x is the axial position along the beam (see
supplementary methods for details). Assuming that transverse
deflection is harmonic in time and space, the shear wave speed, c,
is a function of the shear modulus, μ, of the tissue and axial stress,
σ, acting on the transverse cross-section of the tendon:
c2 ¼ k′μ þ σ
ρ
:
ð2Þ
The derivation is based on incremental motion about a stressed
state, so the shear modulus term, μ, represents the tangential
modulus
for
tendon
which
exhibits
nonlinear
material
behavior16,17. Additionally, since this relationship is derived
based on Timoshenko beam theory14, μ can readily accommodate
the
transversely
isotropic
material
behavior
exhibited
by
tendon18,19. The co-dependence of wave speed on shear modulus
and stress is also seen in acoustoelastic wave propagation models
that explicitly account for external loading and its effects on
nonlinear material properties20. Most shear wave studies to date
make use of the special case in which the axial stress is zero and
the shear correction factor is unity, the latter of which occurs if
the finite nature of the cross-section is neglected. In this case, a
planar shear wave obeys the wave speed equation c2 ¼ μ=ρ
ð
Þ that
has been used to estimate shear modulus from wave speed in
many soft tissues21, including muscle22 and tendon10. However,
we hypothesize that the direct effect of stress on tendon wave
speed can become dominant during movement. For example, the
Achilles tendon transmits axial stresses greater than 20 MPa
during walking4, and exceeding 50 MPa during more dynamic
movements3,13. In contrast, the shear moduli of ligaments, which
have similar hierarchical structure to tendon, range from 0.04 to
1.6 MPa under shear deformation16,17. Thus, the tangential shear
modulus term, which can account for nonlinear strain-stiffening,
is predicted to have negligible effects on wave speed when com-
pared with the axial stress term. This leads to the prediction that
squared wave speed should vary in proportion to tendon stress
c2 / σ
ð
Þ under physiological loads.
To test this prediction, we first simulated shear wave
propagation in a nonlinear finite element model of tendon. A
transversely isotropic hyperelastic material model was used to
describe the behavior of aligned collagen fibers embedded within
an isotropic matrix18. The model-predicted wave speeds agreed
very closely with the tensioned beam model over a plausible range
of shear moduli and axial stress (Supplementary Fig. 1). The
model also supports the assertions that the influence of the
tangent shear modulus on wave speed diminishes as axial stress
increases.
Ex vivo measurement of tendon vibration. We subsequently
conducted a set of ex vivo studies to determine whether the
analytical model would hold in isolated tendons (Fig. 1). Porcine
digital flexor tendons (N = 10) were cyclically loaded up to 300 N
at 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Hz. Micron-scale tendon vibrations were
intermittently induced using a piezo-actuated tapper (Supple-
mentary Fig. 2) and recorded via high frame rate ultrasound.
Each tap induced an underdamped standing wave with a fre-
quency that increased with tensile loading (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Shear wave speed, c, was computed (c = 2fL) from the vibration
frequency, f, and the grip-to-grip length, L, of the tendon. As
predicted by the tensioned beam model, wave speed mono-
tonically increased with the square root of axial stress. Further,
squared wave speed was highly correlated with axial tendon
stress, with coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.96 ± 0.04 (mean
± s.d.) across the 10 tendons tested. This linear relation between
stress and squared wave speed was independent of loading rate (p
= 0.73).
In vivo assessment of tendon shear wave speed. Buoyed by the
ex vivo results, we explored whether we could induce and track
shear waves speeds in vivo in human tendons. We constructed a
piezo-actuated tapper (Supplementary Fig. 2) that could deliver
micron-scale impulses through the skin to superficial tendons.
With the tapper secured over the Achilles tendon, the induced
tendon motion could be felt with the fingertips up to a few
centimeters away. High frame rate (14,100 frames per second)
ultrasonic collections were then used to measure the wave arrival

 times at two points along the tendon (Fig. 2). Unlike the standing
waves seen ex vivo, each in vivo tap induced a transient wave that
propagated along the tendon and then dissipated into the adja-
cent tissue. In this case, wave speed could be computed knowing
the distance between elements and the difference in wave arrival
times,

elastography21,23.
We were surprised to see in our initial in vivo experiments that
both the tendon and adjacent subcutaneous tissue exhibited
similar transient motion as a wave passed by (Fig. 2). This
observation, supported by prior surface wave studies in muscle24
and tendon25, suggested that tendon shear wave vibrations may
be detectable via skin-mounted sensors. To further explore this
idea, we constructed tendon tensiometers consisting of a tapper
and two adjacent miniature accelerometers housed in an elastic
strap (Fig. 3a, b). The tensiometers were secured superficial to the
patellar and Achilles tendons of five subjects, and taps were
delivered at 50 Hz. Each tap induced a transient wave that could
be detected in succession by the near and far accelerometers. We
found that the time interval between wave arrival at the two
sensors was clearly modulated by load applied to the tendon
(Fig. 3c), with time lag decreasing as the tendon was tensioned.
During cyclic isometric knee extension and ankle plantarflex-
ion, wave speeds varied in sync with the net joint torques, ranging
from 15 to 20 m s−1 when the muscles were relaxed, up to 60–80
m s−1 when maximal contractions were performed (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 4). Under simple isometric loading conditions, it can be
assumed that antagonist muscles are relaxed and tendon moment

 arms are relatively constant. Therefore, the tensioned beam model
(Eq. 2) predicts that wave speed in agonist tendons should be
directly related to joint torque. Indeed, linear correlations
between squared wave speed and joint torque were strong for
both the Achilles (R2 = 0.96 ± 0.04, mean ± s.d.) and patellar (R2
= 0.98 ± 0.01) tendons. These results verified that our non-
invasive tensiometer devices could be used to infer loading of
superficial tendons during static activities.
The ultimate value of the shear wave tensiometers is to assess
loads acting on individual muscle–tendon units during move-
ment. To begin to assess this functionality, we tracked Achilles
tendon wave speeds during treadmill walking in five subjects
while simultaneously measuring joint kinetics and muscle
electromyographic (EMG) activities. We found that the tapper-
induced Achilles tendon accelerations were detectable throughout
the walking gait cycles (Supplementary Fig. 5), and could be used
to track dynamically varying wave speeds. Achilles tendon wave
speeds were lowest during early swing, and peaked to a maximum
of 50 to 80 m s−1 when plantarflexor muscles were active at push-
off. During stance, wave speeds varied in phase with ankle torque
and exhibited walking speed-dependent modulation (Fig. 4,
Supplementary Fig. 6). Squared wave speed profiles are generally
consistent with direct tendon load measures previously ascer-
tained using invasive sensors4. However, the Achilles tendon
shear waves do somewhat differ from prior measures of
compression wave profiles in the same tendon, which exhibit a
less distinct peak during push-off26,27. This is not surprising,
given that compression wave speeds are determined by the
tangential elastic modulus26, which varies nonlinearly and
becomes increasingly less sensitive to force when a tendon is
taut19,28,29. Interestingly, shear wave speed measures could detect
tendon loading that is not captured by conventional joint torque
or muscle activity measures. Just before the heel hits the ground
in late swing, the primary plantarflexors (gastrocnemius and
soleus) are inactive and net ankle torque is near zero. Thus,
conventional motion capture and EMG data may lead one to
assume that the Achilles tendon force is near zero. However, a
distinct increase in Achilles tendon wave speed is seen just before
heel strike (Fig. 4a), and likely reflects passive stretch of the
Achilles tendon prior to impact. This observation agrees with
tendon loading data collected using invasive sensors4 and passive
tendon stretch measured with cine ultrasound imaging30.
Applications of tendon shear wave metrics. We envision both
clinical and fundamental uses of shear wave tensiometer tech-
nology. As a clinical example, shear wave speed measures could be
used to assess gait retraining in sports medicine, physical therapy,
and neurorehabilition settings. For example, step rate retraining is
advocated for treating anterior knee pain in runners31. To assess
the intervention, we measured wave speeds in the patellar tendon
while a subject ran at a fixed speed (3.35 m s−1) with different step
rates (Fig. 5a). Wave speed patterns were consistent with knee
extension torques during stance, and showed similar step rate
dependence31. For this subject, the wave speed data suggest that a
+10% increase in step rate from preferred could reduce patellar
tendon stress by 18%. Such information could conceivably be used
as biofeedback to guide gait retraining, and to track tissue load
changes with injury and treatment.
A more fundamental use of tendon wave speed data would be
to investigate how the nervous system coordinates synergistic
muscles during movement. There are many more muscles than
joint degrees of freedom in the human body, leading to an
indeterminate relationship between muscle forces and joint
moments12.
Mathematical
solutions
to
this
indeterminacy
problem have been used for over 30 years32,33, but lack the
human data needed for rigorous evaluation12. For this example,
we used wave speed metrics to assess biceps femoris loading at
speeds ranging from a slow jog (2.68 m s−1) to a fast sprint (8.05
m s−1) (Fig. 5b). The direct wave speed measurements show that
the biceps femoris tendon loading is bimodal over the gait cycle,
with distinct bursts in late swing and early stance. While loading
in both phases clearly increased with speed, the stance phase
induced ~26% higher hamstring load than the swing phase at the
fastest speed. Such objective data could address long-standing
debates about the coordination of synergistic muscles12 and
function of biarticular muscles34.

There are two salient findings from this study that should enable
the use of shear wave measures for investigations of tissue loads

 during human movement. First, we showed via models and
ex vivo experiments that shear wave speed depends directly on
tendon stress at functional loads, whereas prior studies have only
considered low-load behavior where the tissue’s shear modulus
has a more pronounced effect10,35,36 (Supplementary Fig. 1). The
direct dependence on tension provides a fundamental basis to use
wave speed as a sensor of loading. Second, we showed that
micron-scale vibrations can be induced externally in superficial
tendons and detected with skin-mounted accelerometers during
dynamic movements. This finding led to the design of a simple
tendon tensiometer that could be easily deployed in laboratory,
clinic, workplace, and athletic environments.
We found a strong linear relationship between squared wave
speed and joint torques during simple isometric exertions, pro-
viding confidence in using the devices to track in vivo tissue
loads. Achilles tendon wave speed measures during gait were
aligned with active joint torques, while also revealing phases of
passive loading that are not evident in traditional joint kinetic
measures. Further study is needed to investigate how one can
estimate absolute tendon tension from in vivo shear wave speed
metrics. When shear modulus is low relative to stress, our ana-
lytical model suggests that one could estimate tension, T ≈ Aρc2,
from wave speed (c) knowing the effective tissue density (ρ) and
cross-sectional area (A). Tendon cross-section is relatively easy to
assess using either ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging
protocols, but effective density is more challenging. For our
ex vivo study, we estimated the effective density by modeling the
beam as an elliptical cross-section vibrating in water. Clearly, the
in vivo case is more complex with the potential for tendon
vibration to induce motion in adjacent subcutaneous tissue and
muscle. We are embarking on a set of in situ validation experi-
ments in which tendon wave speeds and tension are monitored
simultaneously during robotic gait simulations37. These experi-
ments will be used to assess inter-tendon variability in the wave
speed–stress relationship, which may be attributable to differ-
ences in tendon geometry or added mass effects associated with
adjacent tissues.
If inter-tendon variability in shear wave speed metrics cannot
be well explained by morphological measures, it is feasible to
envision a simple calibration procedure. Simultaneous recordings
of shear wave speed and joint torques can be made during iso-
metric exertions (Supplementary Fig. 4). Tendon tension can be
estimated from joint torque using imaging-based measures of the
tendon’s moment arm38 and assumptions on muscle load sharing
among both agonist and antagonist muscles32. A squared wave
speed–tension calibration can then be attained. Subsequently,
shear wave speeds measured during complex dynamic movement
could be used to estimate absolute tendon tension. Our approach
for estimating tension from shear wave speed is premised on the
assumption that the shear modulus is relatively low under phy-
siological loads, similar to shear modulus values observed in
ligaments subjected to shear deformation16. Additional studies
are needed to directly probe the relationship between tendon
shear modulus and tension under axial loading conditions. Fur-
ther, our tensioned beam model describes plane wave behavior.
More complex wave propagation models based on acoustoelastic
theory20 may be necessary to understand variations in shear wave
speed over the tendon cross-section, which could arise due to
heterogeneity or localized tissue damage.
In summary, we have introduced a coupled theoretical and
practical implementation for using wave speeds to gauge tendon
loading in superficial tendons during dynamic movement. The
tensiometers we introduce utilize miniature accelerometers as the
primary sensor modality, making the technology relatively low
cost and potentially usable in field environments. We envision
numerous applications for investigating the motor control
underlying normal movement and for identifying the bio-
mechanical factors contributing to movement disorders. Further,

 muscle–tendon forces induce much of the loading and defor-
mation that occurs in ligament, cartilage, and skeletal tissues39.
Thus, muscle–tendon load information could be used to guide
rehabilitative interventions, plan orthopedic procedures, assess
tissue healing following treatment, monitor activity, and engineer
viable tissues that can restore lost or impaired motor function.
Methods

transversely isotropic hyperelastic material. The structurally motivated continuum
material model presumes the elastic response of the tissue to arise from aligned
collagen fibers embedded in an isotropic matrix. The strain energy density function

where C3 scales the exponential stresses, C4 modulates the rate of uncrimping of

adapted from the literature16,19,40.
Tendon geometry was modeled as a cylindrical structure with a 3 mm radius
and 60 mm length. The geometry was meshed with 12,960 hexahedral elements.
Fibers were set to be initially aligned with the long axis of the tendon. For each
simulation, the tendon was fixed at one end and the other end was displaced to
induce an axial strain between 0 and 10%. An impulsive transverse displacement
(10 µm over 0.1 ms) was introduced at one end of the tendon. Numerical
integration of the system equations of motion was used to simulate propagation of
the resulting wave along the tissue. Time of arrival of the wave at points 10, 20, and
30 mm from the impulsive input displacement were used to measure wave
propagation speed. Simulations were repeated with a ground substance material
model that produced a shear elastic modulus of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 MPa. See
caption of Supplementary Fig. 1 for full set of parameters used in the simulation.
For each case, we compared the tensioned beam model predictions of wave speed
(Eq. 2) with the finite element model predictions over the range of strains
considered. All simulations were performed in FEBio (www.febio.org).
Ex vivo testing of porcine flexor tendons. Digital flexor tendon specimens (N =
10) were excised from 6–10-month-old porcine feet from approximately 2 cm
beyond the distal muscle–tendon junction to the bony distal insertion. Each spe-
cimen was wrapped in a normal saline (NS; 9.0 g L−1 NaCl)-soaked towel and
placed in a freezer in the time between dissection and testing. Tendons were fully
thawed in NS prior to mechanical testing. Tendons were secured at each end by
waveform grips (G240KSS, Test Resources) in an electrodynamic mechanical test
system (Acumen 3, MTS). Specimens were tested in an NS solution contained
within a custom-built bath to maintain hydration. A 10 MHz, 38 mm wide linear
array transducer (L14-5W/38, BK Utrasound, Richmond, BC, Canada) was affixed
to the front panel of the bath and used to image the tendon through an acoustic
window. B-Mode ultrasonic imaging (SonixTOUCH Research, BK Utrasound) was
initially performed to align the transducer with the longitudinal central axis of the
tendon.
Mechanical tapping device. A tapper was constructed that consisted of a piezo-
electric stack (PK4JQP2, Thorlabs) mounted in a 3D-printed housing (Supple-
mentary Fig. 2). The piezoelectric stack provided linear actuation (19.8 μm
displacement at 150 V) of a 90 mm long push rod that was positioned to be in
contact with the relaxed tendon at a point that was 22 mm from the bottom grip.
A signal generator (SDG1025, Siglent) was used to produce a pulse sequence (1 ms
pulse, 25 Hz repetition rate) that was amplified by an open-loop piezo controller
(MDT694B, Thorlabs) and used to drive the tapper.
Ultrasonic measurement of tendon motion. A research ultrasound system
(SonixTOUCH Research, BK Utrasound) was programmed to collect radio-
frequency (RF) data from a single element located in the middle of the transducer
array. RF signals were collected at 40 MHz to a depth of 2 cm. With a sound
propagation speed of 1560 m s−1, the spatial resolution of the signal along the
sample line was 19 μm. Sampling from a single element allowed us to sample RF
data at an ultra-high frame rate (14,100 frames per second), which was needed to
track transverse tendon vibration. A one-dimensional speckle-tracking algorithm

 was used to track tendon tissue motion from the RF data41. At each frame, RF
signals were first upsampled by a factor of 4 using a polyphase anti-aliasing filter
(resample; MATLAB). We then identified the location of the near and far edges of
the tendon based on the amplitude of the RF signal. A series of 0.5 mm long kernels
(no overlap) were then placed over the width of the tendon. The frame-to-frame
displacements of each kernel were computed by finding the spatial shift that would
maximize the normalized cross-correlation of the RF signal within the kernel with
the RF signal at the subsequent time step. Cosine interpolation of the normalized
cross-correlation functions was used to compute sub-pixel displacements42. Kernel
velocity was then computed by multiplying the incremental displacement by the
frame rate.
Mechanical testing. Tendons were cyclically stretched from 10 to 300 N at 0.5 Hz,
1.0 Hz, and 2.0 Hz. The tendons were initially pre-conditioned with 10 loading
cycles. Following a 7-min rest period, subsequent mechanical testing was per-
formed while the tapper delivered impulsive taps to the tendon. For each data
collection trial, the tendons were stretched for 10 consecutive cycles, with ultra-
sonic RF data, crosshead displacements, and axial forces synchronously collected
over the final 5 cycles. The major and minor axes were measured at three locations
spaced evenly along the tendon. Average tendon cross-sectional area was then
computed based on an elliptical fit of each cross-section. Tendon stresses were
calculated by normalizing the axial force to the undeformed cross-sectional area.
Wave speed measurement. The kernel transverse velocities were band-pass fil-
tered (50–2000 Hz) using a second-order, zero-lag, Butterworth filter to isolate the
signal associated with the tapper-induced vibration. For each tap, the transverse
vibration frequency, f, was determined by performing a fast Fourier transform on
the transient velocity trajectory and finding the peak amplitude of the spectrum.
Wave speed was then calculated assuming a first mode of vibration, c = 2fL, where
L is the distance between the upper and lower grips. A separate collection of
transient tendon motion at multiple points along the tendon was performed and
confirmed that the standing wave represented the first vibratory mode.
The coefficient of determination (R2) was used to assess the relationship
between squared wave speed and axial tendon stress. The effect of loading rate on
the wave speed–stress relationship was assessed in 10 tendons using a one-way
repeated-measures analysis of variance on linear regression slopes of squared wave
speed versus stress for each loading rate. Stress data were separated into 15 evenly
spaced bins, and corresponding mean and s.d. of squared wave speeds were used to
visually assess agreement with the wave propagation model (Fig. 1). All calculations
were performed in MATLAB.
Analytical predictions of wave speed. The tensioned beam model (Eq. 2) was
used to compute predicted wave speeds based on literature estimates of shear
modulus (μ = 0.04–1.6 MPa) and shear correction factor43 (k’ = 0.9), and empirical
measurements of the tendon cross-sectional area (A = 22.6 ± 5.2 mm2) and esti-
mates of the effective density (ρ = 1730 kg m−3). The effective density reflects both
the measured wet tendon density (1060 kg m−3) and added mass effect caused by
entrained motion of the surrounding fluid (see supplementary methods).
Since no estimates are available for shear modulus of loaded tendon, we
considered a range of shear modulus values (0.04 to 1.6 MPa) based on
measurements for ligament under shear deformation16. Shear wave elastography
has been used to measure wave speeds of approximately 8 m s−1 in unloaded
porcine digital flexor tendons44. If the classical shear wave speed equation
c2 ¼ μ=ρ
ð
Þ is used, this corresponds to a shear modulus estimate of approximately
0.06 MPa. This shear modulus is at the lower end of the range we considered in our
model estimates, as would be expected in a strain-stiffening material such as
tendon.
In vivo testing. Six healthy adults participated in the gait collections. Five subjects
(2 female, 3 male; age = 23.2 ± 2.4 years; mass = 73.9 ± 17.0 kg; height = 1.79 ±
0.13 m) underwent Achilles and patellar tendon wave speed collections during
treadmill walking. Representative collections were performed on the patellar ten-
don of one subject (male, 27 years old., 74.4 kg, 1.88 m) during treadmill running at
varied cadences, and on the lateral hamstrings of another subject (male, 21 years
old, 70.3 kg, 1.73 m) during treadmill running at a range of speeds. All participants
provided informed consent prior to testing. The study protocol was approved and
overseen by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Wisconsin-
Madison.
Mechanical tapping device. For human subject testing, a low-profile tapper device
was constructed that could be securely strapped over the Achilles, patellar, or
hamstring tendons. The tapper consisted of an 18.8 mm piezoelectric stack actuator
(PK4JQP2, Thorlabs) driving a lever that rotated about a 3 mm stainless steel hinge
within a 3D-printed housing (Supplementary Fig. 2). The lever amplified the linear
displacement of the actuator (19.8 μm displacement at 150 V) by a factor of 2,
resulting in a 39.6 μm displacement at the skin. A signal generator (FY2300A,
FeelTech) produced a square wave pulse sequence (0.5–9.5 V, 50% duty cycle, 50
Hz repetition rate) that was amplified by an open-loop piezo controller
(MDT694B, Thorlabs) and used to drive the tapper. Transient shear waves were
induced in tendon by both extension and retraction of the actuator. In this study
we present wave speeds derived only from the extension of the actuator, such that
wave speeds were tracked at 50 Hz.
Ultrasonic measurement of tendon motion. We initially used high frame rate
ultrasonic imaging to track Achilles tendon motion in the human subject experi-
ments. A 20 mm wide linear array transducer (HST15-8/20, BK Utrasound) was
secured over the Achilles tendon. A tapper (Fig. 2) was positioned over the tendon
below the transducer and approximately 20 mm superior to the proximal edge of
the calcaneus. B-Mode ultrasonic imaging was initially used to align the transducer
with the longitudinal central axis of the tendon. The ultrasound system (Sonix-
TOUCH Research, BK Utrasound) was programmed to collect RF signals at
40 MHz from two elements separated by 9.3 mm. The first element was located
approximately 25 mm from the tapper. With an imaging depth of 20 mm, the RF
data were sampled at a frame rate of 14,100 frames per second. For each element, a
one-dimensional speckle-tracking algorithm was used to compute kernel velocities
in a manner equivalent to that used in the ex vivo testing.
Accelerometer-based measurement of tendon motion. We measured transverse
motion of the tendon at two locations using single-axis accelerometers (Model
352C23, PCB Piezotronics) with 0.5 mV m−1 s2 sensitivity. The miniature (8.6 ×
4.1 × 2.8 mm, 0.2 g) accelerometers were secured in tight-fitting, 3D-printed
housings to facilitate incorporation into an elastic strap (Fig. 3). The first accel-
erometer was positioned approximately 10 mm from the tapper. Inter-
accelerometer distances (center-to-center) were fixed at 10 mm and 8 mm for the
Achilles and patellar tendons, respectively. Inter-accelerometer distance for the
patellar tendon was decreased slightly due to the relatively limited tendon length
available for measurement in some subjects. Accelerometer signals were amplified
(Model 480B21, PCB Piezotronics) and sampled at 50 kHz using LabVIEW
(National Instruments).
Wave speed calculation using accelerometer data. Accelerometer data were
band-pass filtered (150–1000 Hz) using a second-order, zero-lag, Butterworth filter
to isolate the signal associated with induced shear waves. Data were segmented into
1000-frame (20 ms) windows starting at each leading edge of the tapper excitation
signal (i.e., tapper extension). Within each window, data from each accelerometer
were mean-centered, normalized to the maximum absolute magnitude, squared to
enhance peak magnitudes, and multiplied by the sign of the original measurement
to preserve the wave shape. Subsequently, the inter-accelerometer lag in wave
arrival time was determined by finding the lag that maximized the cross-correlation
between each windowed accelerometer signal. Cosine interpolation of the nor-
malized cross-correlation functions was used to estimate the location of peak cross-
correlation with sub-frame accuracy42. Finally, wave speed was calculated by
dividing the fixed inter-accelerometer distance by the computed inter-
accelerometer time lag. All calculations were performed in MATLAB
(MathWorks).
Isometric testing. Subjects performed isometric knee extension and ankle plan-
tarflexion exertions cyclically at three rates (0.25, 0.50, 1.00 Hz), guided by an
auditory metronome. Subjects were asked to generate near-maximal force, but
there was no feedback provided on effort level. For the knee extension task, subjects
were seated on the edge of a bench with their knee flexed at 90° (Supplementary
Fig. 4). A cuff around the ankle was attached to a fixed load cell (LCM300, Futek)
via a cable. Knee extension forces were sampled at 50 kHz in synchrony with
tendon accelerations.
For the ankle plantarflexion task, subjects were seated in a chair with their ankle
dorsiflexed 10° and their knee flexed at 20° (Supplementary Fig. 4). Subjects pushed
against a force plate (BalanceCheck, Bertec Corp.) with a cylinder adhered to the
force plate and positioned under the head of their first metatarsal to control the
point of load application. Ankle plantarflexion forces were recorded at 2000 Hz,
and synchronized post hoc with tendon acceleration signals by simultaneously
recording an impulsive impact event using both the force plate and a third
accelerometer, which was sampled synchronously with the tensiometer
accelerometers (50 kHz).
Walking gait testing. Subjects walked on an instrumented split-belt treadmill
(Bertec Corp.) at five fixed speeds (0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75 m s−1). Ground
reaction force (GRF) data were collected at 2000 Hz. Kinematic data were collected
at 200 Hz using an eight-camera passive motion capture system (Eagle, Motion
Analysis). Lower body (right leg and pelvis) motion was tracked using a set of 10
anatomical markers placed at the right and left anterior superior and posterior
superior iliac spines, the sacrum, the right lateral femoral epicondyle, tibial
tuberosity, lateral malleolus, calcaneus, and fifth metatarsal-phalangeal joint, and 7
markers on the right thigh and shank. Wireless surface EMG sensors (Trigno,
Delsys) were secured over the right vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, medial gas-
trocnemius, soleus, and tibialis anterior muscles. Sensors were placed according to
SENIAM guidelines (www.seniam.org), and EMG signals were recorded at 2000
Hz.

 Running gait testing. Two subjects were tested during running on a treadmill. For
the step cadence example (Fig. 5a), a tensiometer was secured over the patellar
tendon. The subject first warmed up on a treadmill at his preferred speed and
cadence, which were recorded. An audible metronome was then used to guide three
different step cadences (preferred, ±10%) while the treadmill speed was main-
tained. For each cadence, patellar tendon wave speeds were collected over a
minimum of 10 consecutive strides. For the running speed example (Fig. 5b), the
tensiometer was secured over the distal tendon of the lateral hamstrings (biceps
femoris). Running speed was varied between 2.68 and 8.05 m s−1. At each speed,
lateral hamstring wave speed data were collected for a minimum of 5 consecutive
strides. Running bouts at each speed were kept to under 10 strides and a minimum
of 2 min rest between trials was used to mitigate fatigue effects. The authors affirm
that the research participant appearing in the photographs included in Fig. 5
provided informed consent for their publication.
Analysis. For isometric testing, net knee extension and ankle plantarflexion tor-
ques were calculated based on the fixed distance between the load application
points and the inter-epicondylar axis of the knee and inter-malleolar axis of the
ankle, respectively. Joint torque and wave speed data were low-pass filtered at
20 Hz using a second-order, zero-lag, Butterworth filter. For each subject, the
coefficient of determination (R2) was used to assess the linear relationship between
squared wave speed and joint torque. For each loading rate, stress data were
separated into eight evenly spaced bins. Mean and s.d. of squared wave speeds
corresponding to each bin were used alongside linear fits to visually assess linearity
(Fig. 3d).
For walking gait testing, marker trajectories and GRF data were low-pass
filtered with cut-off frequencies of 6 Hz and 50 Hz, respectively. EMG data were
band-pass filtered (20-450 Hz, Trigno, Delsys) and full-wave rectified. Ankle and
knee torques were computed using previously described inverse kinematics and
inverse dynamics techniques45. Both torque and wave speed data were low-pass
filtered at 20 Hz using a second-order, zero-lag, Butterworth filter. Ankle torque
and squared Achilles tendon wave speed data were ensemble averaged within each
subject across multiple strides.
For running gait testing, strides were delineated by using the distinct
acceleration spikes seen at heel strike. Tendon wave speed data were then ensemble
averaged within each subject across multiple strides.
