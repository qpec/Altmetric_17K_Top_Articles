Peripherally derived macrophages infiltrate the brain after bone marrow transplantation and during central nervous system 
(CNS) inflammation. It was initially suggested that these engrafting cells were newly derived microglia and that irradiation 
was essential for engraftment to occur. However, it remains unclear whether brain-engrafting macrophages (beMφs) 
acquire a unique phenotype in the brain, whether long-term engraftment may occur without irradiation, and whether 
brain function is affected by the engrafted cells. In this study, we demonstrate that chronic, partial microglia depletion is 
sufficient for beMφs to populate the niche and that the presence of beMφs does not alter behavior. Furthermore, beMφs 
maintain a unique functional and transcriptional identity as compared with microglia. Overall, this study establishes 
beMφs as a unique CNS cell type and demonstrates that therapeutic engraftment of beMφs may be possible with 
irradiation-free conditioning regimens.
Peripherally derived macrophages can engraft the 
brain independent of irradiation and maintain an 
identity distinct from microglia

Introduction
Although most tissue resident macrophage populations are ini-
tially populated by primordial yolk sac–derived macrophages 
(Alliot et al., 1999; Ginhoux and Merad, 2011), some are replaced 
with cells derived from fetal monocytes or hematopoietic stem 
cells, leading to either complete replacement of yolk sack–derived 
macrophages or mixed populations that are dominated by cells of 
the fetal monocyte or hematopoietic stem cell lineage (Epelman 
et al., 2014; Hoeffel et al., 2015; Sheng et al., 2015). Microglia, 
however, are a notable exception to this rule, and under homeo-
static conditions, they self-renew from the original yolk sac lin-
eage throughout the life of the animal (Ajami et al., 2007; Elmore 
et al., 2014; Epelman et al., 2014; Bruttger et al., 2015; Hoeffel et 
al., 2015; Sheng et al., 2015).
Monocytes do not enter the healthy brain but are seen within 
the brain parenchyma under certain pathological conditions, 
where their contribution to central nervous system (CNS) pathol-
ogy is highly debated (Butovsky et al., 2012; Jung and Schwartz, 
2012; Chiu et al., 2013; Prinz and Priller, 2014; Yamasaki et al., 
2014; Jay et al., 2015; Thériault et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016). 
Further, the conditions required for macrophage engraftment 
into the CNS parenchyma are not well understood. However, 
hematopoietic cells readily engraft the brain after lethal whole-
body irradiation and bone marrow transplantation (BMT), often 
assumed to be secondary to blood–brain barrier (BBB) opening 
after irradiation (Priller et al., 2001; Mildner et al., 2007).
These peripherally derived brain-engrafting macrophages 
(beMφs) were initially noted to spatially replace microglia, til-
ing with resident microglia, and to develop ramifications similar 
to those of microglia (Priller et al., 2001; Mildner et al., 2007). 
These findings led to the hypothesis that hematopoietic-derived 
macrophages are capable of differentiating into true microglia 
upon engraftment. Indeed, several groups have found that the 
tissue environment directs macrophage differentiation, tran-
scriptomes, and function (Lavin et al., 2014; Gibbings et al., 2015; 
Beattie et al., 2016; Scott et al., 2016; van de Laar et al., 2016), sup-
porting the concept that the brain environment may be sufficient 
to drive differentiation of peripheral-derived microglia.
In the context of clinical implications, it has been shown that 
macrophage engraftment after BMT is beneficial in lysosomal 
storage disease (Walkley et al., 1994; Krivit et al., 1995, 1999; Platt

disorder (Chen et al., 2010), and some mouse models of neuro-
developmental disorders (Derecki et al., 2012; Hsiao et al., 2012). 
However, the role of beMφs in other pathologies, such as CNS 
injury, Alzheimer’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
remains a topic of debate (Prinz and Priller, 2014).
Major questions about beMφs remain. What are the condi-
tions necessary for engraftment into the brain, and is irradia-
tion required for engraftment? Do beMφs alter brain function? 
Do beMφs become true microglia, or are they an indepen-
dent class of resident brain macrophages that exists under 
defined conditions?
Results
Partial microglia depletion leads to beMφ engraftment 
independent of irradiation, without affecting behavior
We first set out to test the hypothesis that creation of a brain 
niche by chronic microglia depletion is sufficient to drive beMφ 
engraftment, independent of irradiation. To deplete microglia 
chronically, we used Cx3cr1CreER/+::Csf1rFlox/Flox mice fed tamox-
ifen chow to chronically excise Csf1r (the gene encoding colo-
ny-stimulating factor 1 receptor, which is critical for microglia 
survival) from cells expressing Cx3cr1, which in the brain is 
restricted to microglia (Li et al., 2006; Goldmann et al., 2013; 
Yona et al., 2013).
Before analyzing the brain, we assessed the peripheral 
immune system, which contains many cells that express Cx3cr1. 
Cx3cr1CreER/+::Csf1rFlox/Flox mice treated with tamoxifen demon-
strated chronic deficiency in Cx3cr1+ lamina propria intestinal 
macrophages (Fig. S1, A–C). Although Cx3cr1lo/negLy6Chi mono-
cytes did not experience significant changes upon tamoxifen 
treatment, Cx3cr1hiLy6Clo monocytes were severely depleted 
in these mice (Fig. S1, D–F), consistent with expression of Cre 
driven by the Cx3cr1 promoter.
We then moved on to analyze the brain. Although no 
differences were observed in microglia counts between 
Cx3cr1CreER/+::Csf1rFlox/Flox and Cx3cr1+/+::Csf1rFlox/Flox animals fed 
control chow (Fig. S2 A), 1 wk on a tamoxifen diet induced an 
∼25% reduction of microglia throughout the brain, which was 
maintained for the duration of tamoxifen treatment (Fig. 1, A and 
B). When Csf1r levels were analyzed after 12 wk on a tamoxifen 
diet, both protein and gene expression were reduced, but not 
completely eliminated, as compared with Cre-negative controls 
(Fig. 1 C and Fig. S2, B and C), consistent with partial microg-
lia depletion. To help explain why microglia were only partially 
depleted, we immunostained for Ki67 and assessed the incorpo-
ration of BrdU. We found that microglia were Ki67+ and BrdU+ 
in Cx3cr1CreER/+::Csf1rFlox/Flox mice, but not Cx3cr1+/+::Csf1rFlox/Flox 
mice, fed tamoxifen chow (Fig. S2, D and E). These data demon-
strate that the microglia niche begins to proliferate in response 
to inducible Csf1r excision, suggesting that microglia loss is coun-
tered by proliferation of the remaining Csf1r-expressing microg-
lia, or that signaling through another growth factor receptor is 
capable of driving microglia proliferation.
Together, these data demonstrated that inducible deletion of 
Csf1r in microglia leads to chronic, partial microglia loss, leaving 
a partially unfilled niche. We could therefore use this model to 
test whether the presence of a niche (formed without irradiation) 
that cannot be filled by microglia, could allow beMφ engraft-
ment. Importantly, we did not detect increased BBB permeability 
in tamoxifen-treated Cre-positive as compared with Cre-nega-
tive mice (Fig. 1 D). We first injected ∼95% pure Ly6ChiCD115+ 
sorted bone marrow monocytes expressing GFP (Fig. S2 F) intra-
venously into Cx3cr1CreER/+::Csf1rFlox/Flox mice on a tamoxifen diet. 
Starting 1 wk after tamoxifen, mice were given three weekly 
intravenous injections of GFP+ monocytes. Mice were analyzed 1 
or 9 wk after the final monocyte transfer (4 or 12 wk after tamox-
ifen initiation). The brains of Cre-positive animals contained 
ramified GFP+ beMφs (Fig. 1 E), whereas none were observed in 
brains of Cre-negative mice (Fig. S2 G). These results supported 
the hypothesis that in the context of chronic microglia deficiency 
(and without CNS irradiation, infection, or BBB compromise), 
circulating monocytes can engraft into the CNS and persistently 
fill the available niche created by depleted microglia, as cells were 
still present 9 wk after the final cell transfer.
It is possible that sorted bone marrow monocytes possess a 
unique ability to engraft the CNS that is not possessed by cir-
culating blood monocytes. To confirm that circulating cells are 
capable of engrafting the CNS, we used parabiotic mice. Cre-neg-
ative or Cre-positive mice were parabiotically joined to UBC-GFP 
mice and placed on a tamoxifen diet for 12 wk. As expected, 
Cre-negative mice had no detectable GFP+ cells in their brains, 
whereas Cre-positive mice contained GFP+ ramified beMφs in the 
parenchyma (Fig. 1 F). Because the bone marrow niche remains 
undisturbed in parabiosis, these results provide evidence that 
circulating monocytes (or, at a minimum, circulating leukocytes) 
indeed possess the ability to engraft the brain and become beMφs 
when the microglia-vacant niche is present.
Although monocyte transfer and parabiosis demonstrated 
that beMφs can and will engraft the microglia-depleted brain 
without irradiation, these experiments did not reveal the poten-
tial extent of beMφ engraftment. To understand the full extent 
of peripheral-derived engraftment into the CNS in tamoxi-
fen-treated Cx3cr1CreER/+::Csf1rFlox/Flox mice, we decided to com-
pletely replace the peripheral immune system with GFP-express-
ing cells. To this end, we performed BMT with lead shielding of 
the head, a well-established technique to prevent beMφ engraft-
ment after BMT (Butovsky et al., 2006, 2007; Rolls et al., 2008; 
Shechter et al., 2009; Derecki et al., 2012). 5 wk after BMT, nearly 
every circulating immune cell (except T cells, which is a known 
phenomenon; Bosco et al., 2010) was GFP+, including nearly 100% 
of monocytes (Fig. S2, H–M).
We then assessed beMφ engraftment at 2, 4, or 12 wk after 
tamoxifen. We could only detect rare GFP+Iba1+ ramified beMφs 
after 2 wk, primarily in circumventricular regions (Fig. S3, A–C), 
but after 4 wk, the circumventricular regions of these mice 
had considerable engraftment of beMφs (Fig. S3, A–D). Inter-
estingly, we observed that although GFP+ cells could be found 
in the choroid plexus and ventricle walls of all mice, ramified 
GFP+Iba1+ beMφs were only present in the brain parenchyma 
in Cx3cr1CreER/+::Csf1rFlox/Flox mice (Fig. S3 D). After 12 wk, we 
found GFP+Iba1+ macrophage engraftment throughout the 
brains of Cx3cr1CreER/+::Csf1rFlox/Flox animals, as opposed to their

Cre-negative counterparts, in which no ramified GFP+ cells were 
observed anywhere in the brain parenchyma (Figs. 1 G and S3 C). 
Furthermore, if we irradiated the entire mouse (including the 
head) beMφ engraftment into Cx3cr1CreER/+::Csf1rFlox/Flox mice 
was greatly accelerated compared with Cre-negative controls 
(Fig. S3, E and F). This suggests that although CNS irradiation 
induces beMφ engraftment, this is substantially enhanced by 
impairment of microglia self-renewal by deletion of Csf1r.
We next set out to interrogate whether beMφ affect brain 
function using a battery of behavioral assays. Head-cov-
ered BMT was performed in Cx3cr1CreER/+::Csf1rFlox/Flox and 
Cx3cr1+/+::Csf1rFlox/Flox mice as described above, and mice were 
fed a tamoxifen diet for 12 wk, followed by 4 wk of control chow 
to eliminate the potential effects of tamoxifen on behavior. We 
found no difference in any behavioral assays tested, such as 
elevated plus maze (Fig. 1 H), open field (Fig. 1 I), sociability 
(Fig. 1 J), rotarod (Fig. 1 K), or Morris water maze (Fig. 1 L). 
Importantly, we found that Cre-positive mice had a mean of 48% 
GFP+ beMφs out of all CNS macrophages/microglia at the con-
clusion of behavioral testing, at which point mice had been on 
control chow for a minimum of 8 wk (Fig. 1 M). Together, these 
results suggest that even with significant microglia replace-
ment by beMφs, overall brain function is not affected.
beMφs are transcriptionally distinct from microglia
We next set out to test the hypothesis that beMφs are an inde-
pendent class of brain macrophage that maintains a unique 
functional and transcriptomic profile. To this end, we decided 
to perform RNA sequencing on beMφ and microglia in three 
unique models of beMφ engraftment. First, we sorted live 
CD45+CD11b+ and either GFP-negative (microglia) or GFP-pos-
itive (beMφ) cells from the same brains of tamoxifen-treated 
Cx3cr1CreER/+::Csf1rFlox/Flox mice. Microglia and beMφ clustered 
strongly by cell type, with cell type accounting for 96% of the 
transcriptional variance (Fig. 2 A). Compared with microglia, 
beMφs had 1,512 differentially up-regulated and 1,598 differen-
tially down-regulated genes (Fig. 2 B and Table S1).
In our second model of beMφ engraftment, we replicated clas-
sic beMφ engraftment models by performing whole-body irra-
diation and BMT with UBC-GFP bone marrow. We then allowed 
cells to engraft and remain for 9 mo and sorted beMφs and 
microglia from the same brains. Again, we found that cell type 
accounted for the large majority of variance (97%; Fig. 2 C), and 
when compared with microglia, beMφs had a large number of 
differentially up-regulated (2,008) and differentially down-reg-
ulated genes (1,596; Fig. 2 D and Table S1).
Our third model was designed to take advantage of the syn-
ergistic effect on engraftment we had observed with the combi-
nation of CNS irradiation and Csf1r deletion in microglia (Fig. 
S3, E and F). Instead of Csf1r deletion using our genetic model, 
we used the Csf1r inhibitor PLX5622 in chow to eliminate the 
irradiation-damaged, yet still viable, microglia. Mice were 
given BMT with UBC-GFP bone marrow with or without head 
covering during irradiation, followed by 1 wk of recovery, 2 wk 
of chow containing PLX5622, and finally 6 wk of recovery on 
standard chow (Fig. 2 E). In this model, mice with head cover-
ing had minimal GFP+ beMφ engraftment and had effectively 
repopulated the CNS with endogenous microglia with mini-
mal beMφ engraftment (Fig. 2 F), consistent with previously 
published data (Elmore et al., 2014). However, mice that had 
received whole-body irradiation demonstrated robust engraft-
ment of GFP+ beMφ (Fig. 2 F), mimicking the synergistic effects 
of inducible deletion of Csf1r and whole-body irradiation with 
BMT in our previous experiments. Because of the robust level

of engraftment in this model, we sorted GFP+ beMφs from 
whole-body–irradiated mice and GFP− microglia from head-cov-
ered mice for RNA sequencing. We again found that cell type 
accounted for the large majority of transcriptional variance 
(92%; Fig. 2 G) and that when compared with microglia, beMφs 
had 829 differentially up-regulated and 1,275 differentially 
down-regulated genes (Fig. 2 H and Table S1).
beMφs are functionally distinct from microglia
To assess beMφ function in each of the three engraftment mod-
els, we used gene set variation analysis (GSVA; Hänzelmann et 
al., 2013) to identify commonly enriched Gene Ontology Bio-
logical Process (GOBP) terms in beMφ versus microglia, and 
vice versa. There were 117 GOBP terms commonly enriched in 
all three beMφ datasets and 47 GOBP terms commonly enriched

in all three microglia datasets (Table S2). Within these com-
monly enriched functional terms, several notable functions 
and themes were apparent. Consistently, beMφs were enriched 
for “regulation of wound healing, spreading of epidermal cells,” 
as well as multiple functions for extracellular uptake, growth 
factor signaling and production, extracellular matrix interac-
tion and migration, regulation of vasculogenesis, interactions 
with neurons and glia, lipid metabolism, and a large number 
of immunological processes (Fig. 3 A and Table S2). Microg-
lia also demonstrated common functions for interaction with 
neurons and glia and lipid metabolism, but also notably had 
multiple functions related to neurotransmitters and steroids 
(Fig. 3 B and Table S2). These results suggest that although 
beMφs and microglia may have some similar functional themes, 
they are not functionally interchangeable cell types, support-
ing the hypothesis that these are two distinct populations of 
CNS macrophages.
Although our RNA-sequencing analysis suggested that 
microglia and beMφs are unique cell types, we decided to exper-
imentally confirm differential response to stimuli. Using our 
system of BMT and PLX5622 treatment for beMφ engraftment, 
which allows substantial repopulation of microglia by beMφs, 
we first tested response to laser burn injury in live multipho-
ton imaging. Our results demonstrate that beMφs moved toward 
the laser burn faster than microglia (Fig. 4 A). We then assessed 
response to in vivo LPS injection. Mice were given i.p. LPS or 
saline injection, and the brains were collected for analysis 6 h 
later. Sholl analysis of Iba1 staining revealed that beMφs were 
less ramified than microglia and demonstrated no change in ram-
ification after LPS, whereas microglia were significantly more 
ramified and demonstrated significant reduction in ramification 
after LPS (Fig. 4 B). Principal component analysis (PCA) of the 
corresponding RNA-sequencing dataset demonstrated distinct 
clustering of samples by cell type and treatment (Fig. 4 C). Differ-
ential expression (DE) analysis revealed a very large number of 
differentially expressed genes after LPS treatment (3,627 up-reg-
ulated and 4,910 down-regulated genes in beMφs as compared 
with microglia; Fig. 4 D and Table S1).
beMφs have a predictable genetic signature
In our RNA-sequencing analysis of saline- or LPS-treated beMφs 
and microglia, we noted gene clusters that remained consistently 
differentially expressed between beMφs and microglia regard-
less of treatment (Fig. 4 D), suggesting that there are core genetic 
signatures that may be used to define and identify beMφs ver-
sus microglia. To this end, we generated genetic signatures for 
beMφs and microglia by first taking the commonly up-regulated 
genes among all three of the models of beMφ engraftment. For 
the beMφ signature, we then refined it by eliminating genes that 
were differentially expressed between peripheral myeloid cells 
and microglia in an RNA-sequencing study performed by Lavin 
et al. (2014); the goal of this refinement was to include only core 
genes that define beMφs versus microglia and not other myeloid 
cells versus microglia. For the microglia signature, we refined the 
signature using the study by Lavin et al. (2014) by only including 
genes that were commonly unique to microglia in their study and 
to the microglia in our datasets. Finally, both signatures were 
refined by eliminating all genes that were not included in func-
tionally enriched terms, thereby creating “functional” genetic 
signatures. This process created a 52-gene microglia signature 
(Mg-52; Fig. 5 A and Table 1) and a 50-gene beMφ signature 
(beMφ-50; Fig. 5 A and Table 2).
Of note, several previously identified microglia-specific 
genes were included in the Mg-52 signature, such as Cst3, Hexb, 
P2ry12, and Sall1, and Tmem119. Based on this, we tested P2ry12 
as a marker of microglia versus beMφs. Indeed, although both 
beMφs and microglia stained for Iba1 (Fig. 5 B), P2ry12 was a 
unique marker for microglia (Fig. 5 C).
We next evaluated the reliability of our signatures within the 
datasets used to generate them. As expected, all three datasets 
universally demonstrated enrichment of Mg-52 in microglia and 
enrichment of the beMφ-50 in beMφ (Fig. 5 D). In a study by 
Matcovitch-Natan et al. (2016), gene clusters involved in stages 
of microglia development were identified. We assessed the over-
lap of our signatures with these microglia developmental gene 
clusters and found that the only substantial overlap occurred 
with the Mg-52 signature and the “Adult Microglia” developmen-
tal gene cluster (37/52 genes in Mg-52; Fig. 5 E). These results 
supported the idea that the Mg-52 signature is specific to adult 
microglia and that the beMφ-50 signature does not correlate to 
any microglia developmental programs.
To test the specificity of Mg-52 and beMφ-50 for their respec-
tive cell types, we used a competitive gene set test (CAM 
ERA; Wu 
and Smyth, 2012). Publically available transcriptomic datasets 
of immune cells (Heng et al., 2008), neurons (Srinivasan et al., 
2016), astrocytes (Srinivasan et al., 2016), beMφs (Bruttger et al., 
2015; Table 3), and our LPS-treated beMφ data (which were not 
used in the generation of signatures) were used to validate the 
signatures. All of these datasets contain microglia samples that 
were used as a common reference cell in our CAM 
ERA analysis. 
As expected, neither neurons nor astrocytes were enriched for 
beMφ-50, but microglia were enriched for the Mg-52 signature 
as compared with neurons and astrocytes (Fig. 5 F and Table 4). 
Similarly, LPS-treated microglia were not enriched for beMφ-50 
as compared with control microglia, whereas control microglia 
were enriched for Mg-52 (Fig. 5 F and Table 4).
Likewise, the Mg-52 signature was enriched in microglia 
compared with all immune cell types tested from the publi-
cally available Immgen microarray dataset (Heng et al., 2008), 
again supporting the fidelity of this signature for the detection 
of microglia versus nonmicroglia (Fig. 5, F and G; and Table 4). 
However, three peripheral immune cell types were significantly 
enriched for beMφ-50: small intestine serosal macrophages, lung 
CD11b+ macrophages, and small intestine lamina propria macro-
phages (Fig. 5, F and G; and Table 4). Interestingly, all three of 
these are monocyte-derived macrophages, providing further evi-
dence of a monocyte origin for beMφ.
Importantly, there was strong enrichment for beMφ-50 in 
beMφ transcriptomes generated in another laboratory (Bruttger 
et al., 2015; Fig. 5, F and H; and Table 4). We also observed strong 
enrichment for beMφ-50 in LPS-treated beMφ (Fig. 5, F and I; 
and Table 4), confirming our initial observation that beMφs and 
microglia have core genes that can be used to define each cell type 
regardless of a strong stimulus.

Finally, we used our signatures to interrogate recently 
published data that purports to have generated induced 
pluripotent stem cell–derived microglia-like cells (iMacs; 
Takata et al., 2017). When CAM 
ERA analysis was applied 
to RNA-sequencing data from iMacs versus bone marrow–
derived macrophages (BM Macs) over the course of an in 
vitro co-culture with neurons, we found that Mg-52 became 
significantly enriched in iMac by day 3 of co-culture, and 
remained enriched through day 12 (Fig. 5 J and Table 4). By 
comparison, beMφ-50 was enriched in BM Mac on days 0 and 
12 (Fig. 5 J and Table 4). These results supported the conclu-
sions of Takata et al. (2017) that they had generated microg-
lia-like cells in vitro.
Overall, these data confirmed that Mg-52 and beMφ-50 rep-
resent core signatures that may be used to define and identify 
microglia and beMφs in a direct comparison. In addition, the 
fact that each cell type has a distinct core genetic program lends 
strong evidence that beMφ indeed represent an independent 
type of macrophage that could have a long-lived presence and 
unique functional implications in the CNS.
Discussion
The role of peripherally derived engrafting macrophages in the 
CNS has long been a subject of scientific interest and debate 
(Prinz and Priller, 2014; Larochelle et al., 2016). In this work, 
we investigated several outstanding questions regarding these 
enigmatic cells. First, using a genetic model of chronic partial 
microglia deficiency, we showed that persistent loss of microg-
lia and their inability to repopulate the niche is sufficient to 
induce beMφ engraftment into the CNS (i.e., in the absence of 
irradiation). Second, we demonstrated that beMφs do not alter 
brain function as measured by a wide array of behavioral tests. 
Third, we found that beMφs maintain a unique transcriptional 
and functional identity in three different models of beMφ 
engraftment. Fourth, we generated functional genetic signa-
tures capable of detecting either beMφs (beMφ-50) or microg-
lia (Mg-52) in a direct comparison. Finally, we validated their 
ability to specifically detect microglia (Mg-52) or beMφs and 
other monocyte-derived macrophages (beMφ-50) in the data-
sets that we generated and in other, publically available tran-
scriptomic datasets.
It was previously unclear as to whether or not beMφ would 
eventually differentiate into bona fide microglia, and thereby 
take on the exact physiological roles of microglia in the CNS. 
Here, we have provided evidence to suggest that beMφs are 
in fact a unique cell type and, although capable of taking up 
long-term residence in the CNS, maintain a unique transcrip-
tional and functional identity. This may help to explain the 
reported therapeutic roles for beMφs (Walkley et al., 1994; 
Krivit et al., 1995, 1999; Platt and Lachmann, 2009; Chen et 
al., 2010; Derecki et al., 2012; Hsiao et al., 2012) and suggests 
that beMφs may not only “replace” dysfunctional microglia 
but also in fact provide unique therapeutic benefits based 
on their unique identity and functional profile. Further, the 
fact that chronic microglia depletion (along with the inabil-
ity of the remaining microglia to proliferate and refill the 
niche) is sufficient to drive beMφ engraftment into the brain 
gives hope that in the future, it may be possible to use radia-
tion-free conditioning regimens to achieve substantial beMφ 
engraftment in patients. Such an approach would focus on 
specifically targeting microglia proliferation while leaving 
the circulating monocyte pool intact. This may be a chal-
lenging task, because both microglia and other myeloid cells 
primarily use Csf1 signaling for proliferation and survival; 
alternative targets for specific microglia depletion would 
likely be necessary in the clinical context. It is also encour-
aging that we did not find any substantial behavioral abnor-
malities upon beMφ engraftment, as this could be a signifi-
cant concern if such high levels of beMφ engraftment were 
achieved in patients.
Our models demonstrate that beMφ could replace microglia 
only when microglia are impaired in their ability to repopulate 
the niche, without the need for irradiation, inflammation, or 
BBB disruption. It is important to note that previously pub-
lished data demonstrating the ability of microglia to self-re-
populate are not refuted by our findings (Elmore et al., 2014; 
Bruttger et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2018). On the contrary, we 
support the concept that under most physiological circum-
stances microglia will repopulate the niche through self-re-
newal. It is conceivable, however, that during the long lifespan 
of a human, beMφs may engraft into a brain under certain 
pathological conditions (in which microglia self-renewal is 
affected), changing the myeloid niche of the brain. Our data 
also suggest that impairment of microglia self-renewal is likely 
one of the primary effects of irradiation-induced repopulation 
of the brain by beMφs.
Together, our findings demonstrate that peripherally derived 
CNS macrophages are a unique cell type capable of replacing 
microglia in the context of microglia deficiency without irradi-
ation. These findings reframe the identity of beMφs and firmly 
place them as an independent class of brain macrophage. Our 
findings may be therapeutically exploited in the future to achieve 
beMφ engraftment without irradiation.

Materials and methods
Animal experiment approval
All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care 
and Use Committee of the University of Virginia.
Mice
Mice were initially purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and 
subsequently maintained and bred in-house under standard 
housing conditions (12 h light/dark cycle and fed ad libitum). All 
mice were on a C57BL/6J background, and both males and females 
were used unless stated otherwise. Strains used were C57BL/6J, 
C57BL/6-Tg(UBC-GFP)30Scha/J, B6.129P2(C)-Cx3cr1tm2.1(cre/ERT2)
Jung/J, and B6.Cg-Csf1rtm1.2Jwp/J. Cx3cr1CreER/+::Csf1rFlox/Flox mice 
were generated by breeding Cx3cr1CreER/+::Csf1rFlox/Flox mice with 
Cx3cr1+/+::Csf1rFlox/Flox mice. For experiments using tamoxifen, 
mice were fed TD.130856 at 250 mg/kg diet (purchased from 
Harlan) starting at 4 wk after birth or as otherwise specified in 
figures. Experimental groups were blinded before beginning the 
experiment and remained blinded until the end.
Irradiation and BMT
Mice were γ irradiated with a lethal dose of 1,000 rad. 4 h 
after irradiation, mice were intravenously injected with 5 × 106 
bone marrow cells. Mice were given water supplemented with

trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 2 wk and monitored daily 
for the first 4 d. A lead shield was placed over the head during 
irradiation in some experiments, as indicated.
Tissue collection
Mice were euthanized with Euthasol and transcardially perfused 
with 0.01 M PBS containing 5 U/ml heparin. Blood was collected 
from the retinal artery after removing the eye and placed in hep-
arinized tubes. For immunohistochemistry, brains were care-
fully removed and dropped fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 
48 h. Brains were then washed with PBS and stored at 4°C until 
further processing. For isolating cells, brains were harvested and 
immediately processed as described below. Intestinal cell suspen-
sions were prepared as previously described (Cronk et al., 2015). 
In brief, the entire length of the small intestine was excised 
and opened longitudinally. Luminal contents were washed in 
Ca/Mg-free PBS, chopped in 2.5-cm pieces, and placed in coni-
cal tubes containing 30 ml HBSS, 5% FBS, and 2 mM EDTA. The 
tubes were shaken at 37°C and 250 rpm for 20 min, after which 
the intestines were strained through a nylon mesh and washed 
again under the same conditions. After the last wash, the intes-
tines were transferred into 20 ml HBSS containing 900 U/ml 
Collagenase VIII (Sigma) and 40 U/ml DNase-I (Sigma) and then 
shaken for 15 min at 200 rpm to digest. After the incubation, the 
tubes were vortexed thoroughly and the resulting cell suspen-
sion passed through 70-µm cell strainers into clean tubes. The 
cells were washed twice with cold HBSS, 5% FBS, and 2 mM EDTA 
and centrifuged at 4°C, 425 relative centrifugal force (RCF), for 
5 min. After the last wash, the supernatant was decanted and 
the pellet was resuspended in FACS buffer containing 0.01 M 
PBS, 1% BSA, 2 mM EDTA, and 0.1% sodium azide and prepared 
for FACS analysis.
Flow cytometry
After tissue collection (as described above), cells were incubated 
with flow cytometry antibodies at 4°C for 30 min in a total vol-
ume of 200 µl of flow cytometry buffer (PBS containing 0.1% 
sodium azide and 1% BSA), washed with 5 ml flow cytometry 
buffer, pelleted at 300 RCF, decanted, and analyzed on a Gallios 
flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Antibodies were purchased 
from BD PharMingen except for CD115 (BioLegend).
Immunohistochemistry
Brains were collected as described above and cryoprotected 
in 30% sucrose. After freezing in optimum cutting tempera-
ture compound (Sakura Finetek), 40-µM sections were cut on 
a cryostat (Leica). Floating sections were stored in PBS con-
taining Azide (0.02%) until further processing. For immu-
nohistochemistry, brain sections were permeabilized with 
PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and then blocked with 10% 
chicken serum in PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 for 1 h. 
Sections were then incubated overnight with primary anti-
body in PBS containing 2% chicken serum. Primary antibod-
ies included rabbit anti-GFP (1:1,000; Abcam), goat anti-Iba1 
(1:300; Abcam), rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:300; Wako), rabbit-anti 
Ki67 (1:500; Abcam), and rabbit anti-P2ry12 (1:10,000; gift 
from O. Butovsky, Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, 
Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Bos-
ton, MA). After incubating primary antibody, sections were 
washed three times and then incubated with fluorescently 
conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1,000) in PBS containing 
0.05% Triton X-100 and 2% chicken serum for 1 h. Sections 
were then washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tri-
ton X-100. DAPI was added to the second wash to stain DNA 
containing nuclei. Sections were then mounted on microscope 
slides with Aquamount. All images were collected on a Leica 
SP8 confocal microscope or Leica wide-field microscope.
BrdU proliferation assay
BrdU injection and analysis were performed as previously 
described (Lu et al., 2011). In brief, mice were injected twice (i.p.) 
with 50 mg/mg BrdU, with 2 h between each injection. Brains 
were analyzed by immunohistochemistry 24 h after the last 
BrdU injection.
Cell sorting
To FACS sort microglia and beMφ, brains were collected after 
euthanization and systemic perfusion with PBS, and then menin-
ges were removed. Brains were physically minced and incubated 
in a 15-ml tube in 5 ml HBSS containing Mg and Ca, 2 mg/ml 
papain, 50 U/ml DNA 
SE-I (Sigma), and Glutamax (Invitrogen) 
at 37°C for 15 min. After gentle trituration, the brains were incu-
bated at 37°C for an additional 15 min, triturated, incubated at

quencing datasets. The values are standardized rlog-transformed values across samples. (E) Overlap of the Mg-52 and beMφ-50 in the microglia developmental

ERA test statistic for each signature (beMφs over microglia), which is used to calculate the corrected p-value (FDR corrected). Samples falling outside of the 
gray area indicate a statistically significant (FDR <0.001) enrichment of the signature. Samples falling to the left of the gray area demonstrate enrichment for 
the signature in microglia as compared with the tested cell type. Samples falling to the right of the gray area demonstrate enrichment for the signature in the 
tested cell type as compared with microglia. Statistics can be found in Table 4. (G) Heatmap of the Mg-52 and beMφ-50 signatures in the Immgen microarray

dardized rlog-transformed values across samples. (J) Enrichment of the Mg-52 and beMφ-50 signatures in induced pluripotent stem cell–derived microglia-like

37°C for an additional 15 min, and triturated a third time. After 
this, the tubes were filled with DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS 
and filtered through a 70-µM cell strainer. Cells were pelleted 
at 300 RCF and sorted as follows. Cells were incubated with 
CD11b+ microglia magnetic selection beads according to manu-
facturer’s protocol (Miltenyi). Cells were then positively selected 
by AutoMACS and used for downstream applications or FACS 
sorted by gating on live cells by DAPI exclusion (DAPI-negative 
cells, high side scatter exclusion, singlet events, CD45Lo, CD11b+, 
and either GFP− [microglia] or GFP+ [beMφs]). Monocytes were 
isolated from bone marrow using mouse bone marrow monocyte 
selection beads and sorted on an LS magnetic columns accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s protocol (Miltenyi). Sorted monocytes 
were at least 95% pure monocytes (CD11b+Ly6CHiCD115+) by 
flow cytometry.
RNA sequencing and quantitative RT-PCR
RNA was isolated from FACS-sorted microglia using an RNeasy 
mini kit (QIA 
GEN). Each sample used for RNA-sequencing was 
pooled from three or four total mice per sample. For quantita-
tive RT-PCR, cDNA was generated using High Capacity cDNA kit 
(Applied Biosystems) and Csf1r gene expression was analyzed 
with the Mm00432691_m1 TaqMan Gene Expression assay. For 
RNA sequencing, all postprocessing (including linear RNA ampli-
fication and cDNA library generation) and sequencing was per-
formed by Hudson Alpha Genomic Services Laboratory.
Evans blue BBB permeability assay
To test for BBB permeability, mice were injected i.p. with Evans 
blue (13.3 µl/g of a 2% Evans blue solution dissolved in PBS) and 
samples were collected 1 h after injection. Mice were eutha-
nized by Euthasol, perfused with ice cold PBS, and brains were 
removed. One half of each brain was homogenized in 1ml of PBS 
and mixed with one volume of 50% trichloroacetic acid, then 
incubated overnight at 4°C to precipitate out proteins and other 
particulates. Samples were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 30 min, 
4°C. Supernatants were analyzed by 96-well plate reader at 620 
nm (Multiskan FC; Fisher Scientific), and a standard curve was 
generated using known concentrations of Evans blue dye in PBS 
mixed 1:1 with 50% trichloroacetic acid.
Parabiosis
Surgery for parabiosis was performed as previously described 
(Radjavi et al., 2014). Female UBC-GFP mice were paired to 
Cx3cr1CreER/+::Csf1rFlox/Flox mice or Cre-negative controls matched 
for age, sex, and weight. After parabiosis surgery, mice were 
allowed 3 wk to recover before a 12-wk tamoxifen treatment.
Behavior
Behavioral testing was performed as previously described 
(Radjavi et al., 2014; Filiano et al., 2016). Before all behavior 
testing, mice were acclimated to the testing room for 1 h. Test-
ing schedules were balanced for genotype and the observer was 
blinded to all conditions. Mazes were cleaned with 70% etha-
nol between trials and all behavioral assays were performed 
during the light hours avoiding 1 h after and before the lights 
turned on and off.
Plus maze
Mice were place into the center hub of the plus maze and were 
free to explore for 5 min. Movement was calculated with TopScan 
(CleverSys), and data were represented as percentage of time 
spent in the open arms during the 5-min trial.
Open field
Mice were placed into an open field (35 cm × 35 cm) and were free 
to explore for 15 min. Movement was monitored via TopScan, and 
data were represented as percentage of time spent in the center 
of the box (23 cm × 23 cm) during the 15-min trial.
Sociability
Social behavior was tested using the three-chamber assay. Mice 
were placed into the center chamber of a three-chamber social 
box and were free to explore all three rooms for 10 min per phase. 
For the habituation phase, empty wire cages (Spectrum Diversi-
fied Designs) were placed in the two outer rooms. After the initial 
habituation phase, the mice were returned to the center room for 
the social phase, where a novel mouse was placed under one cup 
(8–10-wk-old male habituated to the cup) and a novel object was 
placed under the other cup. Tracking was scored with TopScan, 
and time spent investigating around each cup was quantified.

Biology and function of peripheral macrophages in the brain
1641
Rotarod
Motor behavior was tested with an accelerated rotarod (MedAs-
sociates). Mice were placed on an accelerating rotarod that 
accelerated from 4.0 to 40 rpm over 5 min. The latency of the 
mouse to fall off the rod was monitored via infrared beams. 
Mice were given six trials with a 4-h intertrial interval between 
trials 3 and 4.
Morris water maze
Cognitive function was tested with the water maze. For the acqui-
sition phase, mice were placed in a 100-cm pool of opaque water 
with a hidden platform 1 cm under the surface. Mice were given 
three trials per day (maximum of 60 s) to find the platform with 
30 min between each trial. This was repeated for 4 d. On the fifth 
day, for the probe trial, the platform was removed and mice were 
given 60 s to explore the maze. Video tracking of movement was 
performed with an EthoVision tracking system. For the acquisi-
tion phase, data were represented as latency to reach the plat-
form. For the probe trial, data were represented as time spent in 
the quadrant that previously contained the platform.
Laser-burn injury
Brain macrophages were imaged by multiphoton microscopy. 
To target microglia, Cx3cr1CreER/+::Ai6 were irradiated with 
head shielding and given bone marrow from a wild-type donor 
mouse. To target beMφ, wild-type mice were irradiated and 
given bone marrow from a Cx3cr1GFP/+ donor mouse. After 4 
wk of recovery, mice were fed tamoxifen for 4 wk to pulse-la-
bel macrophages and then placed back on normal chow. After 
4 wk on normal chow, all mice were fed PLX5622 for 2 wk to 
clear out the brain macrophage pool and allowed to recover for 
6 wk before imaging. For imaging, mice were anesthetized with 
ketamine/xylene (i.p.). Two-photon laser injury was performed 
by focusing a two-photon laser beam in the superficial layer 
of the cortex (∼50 µm deep) through a thinned intact skull as 
previously described (Davalos et al., 2005). In brief, a 780-nm 
two-photon laser (Chameleon Ultra II tunable Ti: 
Sapphire laser; 
Coherent) with a laser power of 60 to 80 mW was applied to a 
region of interest of 20 µm of diameter for ∼30 s (the efficiency 
of the injury was visualized by the bright autofluorescence 
sphere in the region of interest). The area was imaged for 30 min 
before the laser injury and 30 min after laser injury. Images were 
acquired using a ×25 water-immersion objective with 0.95 NA 
and external HyD nondescanned detectors (Leica). Four-dimen-
sional imaging data were collected by obtaining images from the 
x, y, and z planes over time.
Image analysis
Automated image analysis algorithms were developed and 
implemented in the Virginia Image and Video Analysis labora-
tory (Acton). The software was written in the MAT 
LAB (Math-
Works) environment.
Process detection
Microglia and engrafted macrophage processes were detected 
from the images using area morphology implemented via con-
nected filters (Acton and Mukherjee, 2000; Acton, 2001; Acton 
and Ray, 2006). Such connected filters have advantages over 
traditional filters in that they are edge preserving and do not 
depend on binarized versions of the image. The processes were 
detected that had a two-dimensional area (observed via maxi-
mum intensity projection) within a range of 15 to 75 µm2 and 
sufficient contrast with the background (>4% of intensity range). 
The positions of the processes were recorded by computing the 
region centroids.
Process tracking
Individual process locations were tracked temporally from frame 
to frame by finding a correspondence between detections (Scott 
Thomas Acton, 2006). The correspondence was determined by 
spatial proximity, consistency in direction of motion, and simi-
larity in size. Group motion (and corresponding velocity) of the 
processes was computed using a dynamic Sholl analysis. The 
Sholl diagram was centered at the center of the burn site and 
consisted of five annuli of ring width of 17 µm. Groups of pro-
cesses were tracked (in maximum intensity projection images) 
from the time of maximum population in the fifth annulus to 
the time of maximum population (of detected processes) in the 
third annulus (which was just outside the perimeter of the burn). 
This group tracking provided an overall speed computation that 
was robust to false positives and missed detections in the process 
detection task.

LPS challenge
To determine transcriptional and morphological changes of 
microglia and beMφs to an insult, mice were given a peripheral 
LPS challenge. Mice were first irradiated and given BMT with 
UBC-GFP bone marrow. To target microglia, head shielding was 
applied during irradiation in some mice. After 1 wk of recovery, 
mice were treated with PLX 5622 for 2 wk to deplete the brain 
macrophage niche and then placed on standard chow for 6 wk. 
Mice were injected with 50 µg LPS or saline (i.p.). 6 h later, brains 
were removed and macrophages sorted by MACS on CD11b beads 
as described above.
RNA-sequencing and functional analysis
The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession numbers 
for RNA-sequencing data generated for this publication are 
GSE84819, GSE108569, and GSE108575. All other previously 
published datasets used in this paper are listed with GEO under 
the accession numbers shown in Table 3 (GSE68376, GSE15907, 
GSE63340, GSE75246, and GSE99078). The raw sequencing 
reads (FAS 
TQ files) went through two stages of preprocessing 
to remove low-quality reads and bases. First, they were chastity 
filtered, which removes any clusters that have a higher than 
expected intensity of the called base compared with other bases. 
They were then trimmed with Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014) 
to remove low-quality bases (minimum read length after trim-
ming, 36). After preprocessing, the quality of the reads was eval-
uated using FastQC (Andrews, 2010), and after passing quality 
control were aligned to the UCSC mm9 genome (Harrow et al., 
2012) using the splice-aware read aligner STAR (Dobin et al., 
2013). The quality of the alignments was next assessed by SAM-
Stat (Lassmann et al., 2011), and any low-quality alignments 
were removed with samtools (Li et al., 2009; MAPQ <10). Next, 
the number of reads aligning to each gene was quantified with 
HTSeq (Anders et al., 2015), and then the Bioconductor package 
(Love et al., 2014). DESeq2 was used to normalize the raw counts, 
perform exploratory analysis (e.g., PCA), and DE analysis. Before 
DE analysis of the BMT/PLX dataset, surrogate variable analy-
sis (Leek and Storey, 2007) was used to identify and adjust for 
latent sources of unwanted variation as implemented in the sva 
package (Leek et al., 2012). The p-values from the DE analysis 
were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing with the Benja-
mini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) procedure. Heatmaps 
were generated with the R package pheatmap (Kolde, 2015), and 
UpSet plots (Lex et al., 2014) were created with the R package 
UpSetR (Gehlenborg, 2016). The functional terms enriched in 
beMφs and microglia for our RNA-sequencing datasets were 
determined with GSVA (Hänzelmann et al., 2013). The gene sets 
used for this analysis were from the GOBP (Ashburner et al., 
2000; The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2017).
Microarray analysis
All of the microarrays were analyzed using a combination of the 
affy (Gautier et al., 2004), oligo (Carvalho and Irizarry, 2010), and 
limma (Ritchie et al., 2015) packages from Bioconductor. For the 
Affymetrix arrays, the expression values for each probe set were 
extracted using the robust multichip average (RMA) methodol-
ogy (Irizarry et al., 2003). For the Agilent arrays, the probes were 
background corrected using a normal exponential convolution 
model (as implemented in limma; Silver et al., 2009) and quantile 
normalized. Replicate probes were summarized using the mean.
Signature creation
To create the Mg-52 signature, we first identified the differen-
tially up-regulated genes in microglia versus beMφs in all three 
of the Kipnis datasets: the genetic model, traditional BMT, and 
BMT/PLX RNA sequencing. To be called significant, a gene needed

Publically available transcriptomic datasets and transcriptomic data generated in the current study were used to assess for enrichment of Mg-52 and 
beMφ-50 gene signatures. CAM 
ERA analysis was performed as described in Materials and methods.

to have a fold change >1.5 and a corrected p-value <0.05. These 
criteria for significance were used to identify all differentially 
expressed genes hereafter. Next, we identified the differentially 
up-regulated genes in microglia versus peripheral myeloid cell 
types (nine cell types in total) from the Lavin RNA-sequencing 
dataset (Lavin et al., 2014). The cell types in this dataset were 
peritoneal Mφ, small intestine Mφ, large intestine Mφ, mono-
cytes, Kupffer Mφ, red pulp Mφ, alveolar Mφ, and neutrophils. 
The Mg-52 signature was defined as the 52 genes that were (a) 
up-regulated in microglia in all three of the Kipnis datasets, (b) 
up-regulated in eight out of nine microglia versus peripheral 
myeloid cell comparisons from the Lavin dataset, and (c) included 
in a gene set that was functionally enriched in microglia in at 
least one of the Kipnis datasets. To create the beMφ-50 signature, 
we first identified the differentially up-regulated genes in beMφ 
versus microglia in all three of the Kipnis datasets and the differ-
entially up-regulated genes in the nine myeloid cell types versus 
microglia in the Lavin RNA-sequencing dataset. The beMφ-52 
signature was defined as the 50 genes that were (a) up-regulated 
in beMφ in all three of the Kipnis datasets, (b) not up-regulated 
in the peripheral myeloid cells from the Lavin dataset, and (c) 
included in a gene set that was functionally enriched in beMφ in 
at least one of the Kipnis datasets.
Signature detection
The signatures were detected in the various transcriptomic 
datasets using CAM 
ERA (Wu and Smyth, 2012; part of the limma 
package). The intergene correlation was set to 0.01. To use CAM 
ERA with the RNA sequencing data, the raw counts needed to be 
transformed and normalized with the voom function (Law et al., 
2014). This was not necessary for the microarray data. CAM 
ERA 
returns both a test statistic and an FDR-corrected p-value. The 
test statistic was used as an enrichment score, with larger values 
of the statistic corresponding to a greater enrichment of the sig-
nature. To ensure the fidelity of the signature detection, we used 
a stringent corrected p-value threshold of 1E-3.
