ver the past 2 decades, the medical community has 
increasingly recognized sports-related concussion 
(SRC) as a widespread public health problem.19 
The specific definition of SRC continues to evolve,23 but 
is generally defined as a concussive blow to the head that 
results in a variable set of clinical signs (e.g., loss of con-
sciousness, vomiting, imbalance) and symptoms (e.g., 
headache, dizziness, amnesia, confusion, visual distur-
bance). Across different sports, SRC has been most stud-
ied in American football, where collegiate athletes can 
sustain more than 1000 head impacts in a typical season.15 
Fortunately, the overwhelming majority of these head im-
abbreviatioNs CTE = chronic traumatic encephalopathy; GEE = generalized estimating equation; HITS = Head Impact Telemetry System; NCAA = National Collegiate 
Athletic Association; PLA = peak linear acceleration; PRA = peak rotational acceleration; SRC = sports-related concussion; UVa = University of Virginia.

obJective This study directly compares the number and severity of subconcussive head impacts sustained during 
helmet-only practices, shell practices, full-pad practices, and competitive games in a National Collegiate Athletic Asso-
ciation (NCAA) Division I-A football team. The goal of the study was to determine whether subconcussive head impact in 
collegiate athletes varies with practice type, which is currently unregulated by the NCAA.
methods Over an entire season, a cohort of 20 collegiate football players wore impact-sensing mastoid patches that 
measured the linear and rotational acceleration of all head impacts during a total of 890 athletic exposures. Data were 
analyzed to compare the number of head impacts, head impact burden, and average impact severity during helmet-only, 
shell, and full-pad practices, and games.
results Helmet-only, shell, and full-pad practices and games all significantly differed from each other (p ≤ 0.05) in 
the mean number of impacts for each event, with the number of impacts being greatest for games, then full-pad practic-
es, then shell practices, and then helmet-only practices. The cumulative distributions for both linear and rotational accel-
eration differed between all event types (p < 0.01), with the acceleration distribution being similarly greatest for games, 
then full-pad practices, then shell practices, and then helmet-only practices. For both linear and rotational acceleration, 
helmet-only practices had a lower average impact severity when compared with other event types (p < 0.001). However, 
the average impact severity did not differ between any comparisons of shell and full-pad practices, and games.
coNclusioNs Helmet-only, shell, and full-pad practices, and games result in distinct head impact profiles per event, 
with each succeeding event type receiving more impacts than the one before. Both the number of head impacts and 
cumulative impact burden during practice are categorically less than in games. In practice events, the number and 
cumulative burden of head impacts per event increases with the amount of equipment worn. The average severity of 
individual impacts is relatively consistent across event types, with the exception of helmet-only practices. The number of 
hits experienced during each event type is the main driver of event type differences in impact burden per athletic expo-
sure, rather than the average severity of impacts that occur during the event. These findings suggest that regulation of 
practice equipment could be a fair and effective way to substantially reduce subconcussive head impact in thousands of 
collegiate football players.

pacts do not cause clinical concussion in collegiate foot-
ball players, but there are growing concerns that multiple 
“subconcussive” hits to the head might cause anatomical 
and/or physiological damage to the brain.
A recent review identified subconcussion as an entity 
distinct from concussion, defining subconcussion as a 
“cranial impact that does not result in known or diagnosed 
concussion on clinical grounds.”1 This differentiation is 
primarily driven by concerns that subconcussive impacts 
have their own short-term and long-term effects on brain 
physiology. In the short term, subconcussion has already 
been linked to increased susceptibility to concussion,2–4,14 
decreased cognitive function,5 altered gray matter func-
tional connectivity,18,34 and changes in white matter micro-
structure.12,23 Over the long term, retired football players 
who have sustained high levels of subconcussive impact 
over their careers have been hypothesized to have an in-
creased risk of developing neurodegenerative disorders, 
like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, 
Parkinson’s disease, and chronic traumatic encepha-
lopathy (CTE).20,29 CTE has a proposed association with 
concussions, but repetitive and cumulative subconcussive 
forces have been implicated as well.7,25,33
Given the uncertain risks, many high-impact sports 
have implemented regulations to reduce the burden of 
head impact in athletes, with particular emphasis on foot-
ball.27,28 In football, differences in subconcussive head im-
pact can be seen when comparing player position,11,26 play-
ing level,9,36 and practice-versus-game exposures.6,10,22,37 
It seems intuitive that different types of football practice 
might result in different burdens of head impact, but no 
published study has directly tested this hypothesis. The 
National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) notes 
this lack of data in its football practice guidelines as a ra-
tionale for not regulating football practice equipment for 
in-season, postseason, and bowl practices.27 Our study 
directly compares the number and severity of subconcus-
sive head impacts sustained during helmet-only practices, 
shell (half-pad) practices, full-pad practices, and competi-
tive games in an NCAA Division I-A football team, with 
the goal of determining whether regulating practice types 
might limit subconcussive head impact in collegiate ath-
letes.
methods
study participants
In 2013, a cohort of 20 University of Virginia (UVa) 
football players (6 first-year, 2 second-year, 4 third-year, 
6 fourth-year, and 2 fifth-year students) wore head-impact 
sensors during official practices and games. No athlete 
had a history of developmental or neurological disorder, 
or severe traumatic brain injury. Ten athletes had a his-
tory of concussion prior to the start of the 2013 season. 
Three athletes were diagnosed with concussion during the 
course of the 2013 season. The average time to return to 
play for the concussed athletes was 6.33 days.
standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient 
consents
The protocol was approved by the UVa Institutional 
Review Board for Health Science Research. All partici-
pants gave written informed consent.
biomechanical measurements
Study participants wore the xPatch impact-sensing 
skin patch (X2 Biosystems) on the skin covering their 
mastoid process (left or right side, decided by the athlete). 
The sensor was to be worn during all official team prac-
tices and games, although athletes maintained the right to 
refuse at each event. The xPatch contains a triaxial high-
impact linear accelerometer and a triaxial gyroscope to 
capture six degrees of freedom for linear and rotational 
accelerations. Impact to the body or head can result in 
head acceleration; however, for simplicity we will hence-
forth refer to impacts that result in acceleration of the 
head as “head impacts.” If an accelerometer exceeded 
a predetermined 10g linear acceleration threshold, 100 
msec of data (10 msec pretrigger and 90 msec posttrigger) 
from each accelerometer and gyroscope were recorded 
to onboard memory. Raw accelerometer data were then 
transformed to the head center of gravity by using a rigid-
body transformation for linear acceleration and a 5-point 
stencil for rotational acceleration. False impacts are re-
moved by X2 Biosystems’ proprietary algorithm, which 
compares the waveform of each impact to a reference 
waveform using cross-correlation. Impacts with a resul-
tant linear acceleration less than 10g were removed. Im-
pact data were then time-filtered to include only impacts 
that occurred during a practice or game. Participants with 
less than 20% of their athletic exposures captured (4 ath-
letes) were removed from the analyses. Cumulative im-
pact measures were calculated per athletic exposure by 
summing each impact weighted by its severity. For each 
athlete, all recorded practices were included; however 
the athlete needed to participate in at least one play for a 
game to be included in the analysis.
statistical analyses
Data Summarization
Categorical data were summarized by frequencies and 
percentages, whereas continuous scaled data and count 
data were summarized by the mean, median, and range of 
the measurement distribution.
Analysis of the Number of Hits per Event
Data for the total number of recorded impacts that 
players sustained per athletic event were analyzed via a 
negative binomial generalized estimating equation (GEE) 
model.16 The classification variable “Athletic Event Type,” 
with the categories helmet-only practice, shell practice, 
full-pad practice, and game, was the independent variable 
of interest in analysis, and “Player” represented the GEE 
variance-covariance cluster factor in variance-covariance 
estimation. With regard to hypothesis testing, the means 
of the distributions for the number of hits per athletic event 
were compared in a pairwise manner between the 4 dif-
ferent athletic event types. The null hypothesis for each 
pairwise comparison was that the mean of the distribution 
for the number of hits per athletic event was the same for 
both “Athletic Event Type” categories. The GEE version

of the Wald statistic was used as the pivotal quantity for 
each null hypothesis test, and a Bonferroni corrected a 
= 0.05 decision rule32 was used as the null hypothesis re-
jection criterion. Confidence interval construction for the 
mean number of hits per athletic event and for the ratio of 
mean number of hits per athletic event was based on the 
Wald methods.
Analysis of the Number of Impacts Past Thresholds
In increments of 10g we examined the number of im-
pacts per athletic event beyond 10g to beyond 100g via 
a negative binomial GEE model. Similarly, in increments 
of 2000 rad/s2 we examined the number of impacts per 
athletic event with peak acceleration beyond 0 rad/s2 to 
beyond 30,000 rad/s2 via a negative binomial GEE model. 
For each GEE model, “Athletic Event Type” and “Impact 
Threshold” served as the independent variables, and the 
player’s impact data within an event represented the GEE 
variance-covariance data cluster in variance-covariance 
estimation. With regard to hypothesis testing, the impact 
threshold profiles were compared in a pairwise manner 
between the 4 different athletic event types. The null hy-
pothesis for each pairwise comparison was that the mean 
of the distribution for the number of impacts per athletic 
event beyond the specified threshold was the same for 
both “Athletic Event Type” categories. The GEE version 
of the Wald statistic was used as the pivotal quantity for 
each null hypothesis test, and a Bonferroni corrected a = 
0.05 decision rule was used as the null hypothesis rejec-
tion criterion.
Analysis of Cumulative Impact Load per Event
The cumulative distributions for peak linear accel-
eration (PLA) and for peak rotational acceleration (PRA) 
were compared between the 4 different “Athletic Event 
Type” categories via the GEE version of the Cox propor-
tional hazards model.35 Pairwise cumulative distribution 
comparisons were based on the GEE version of the Wald 
statistic, and a Bonferroni corrected a = 0.05 decision rule 
was used as the null hypothesis rejection rule. Confidence 
interval construction for median PLA and median PRA 
was based on the confidence interval method of Brook-
meyer and Crowley.8
Analysis of Average Impact Severity per Event
The average impact PLA and PRA data were analyzed 
on the natural logarithmic scale via linear mixed mod-
els.24 The classification variable “Athletic Event Type” 
served as the linear mixed-model independent variable, 
and individual players represented the random effect. 
With regard to hypothesis testing, pairwise comparisons 
of the geometric means of the average impact-severity 
distributions were conducted between the 4 different 
athletic event types. For each pairwise comparison, un-
der the null hypothesis it was assumed that the geomet-
ric means of the two distributions were equal (i.e., the 
geometric mean ratio = 1). The t-statistic served as the 
pivotal quantity for each hypothesis test, and a Bonfer-
roni corrected a = 0.05 decision rule was used as the null 
hypothesis rejection criterion.
Analysis of Cumulative Impact Load per Season
Average cumulative measures were calculated for each 
exposure type (helmet-only, shell, and full-pad practices, 
and games), and then they were multiplied by the total 
number of practices of each type or number of games in 
which the athlete participated in at least one play. No for-
mal statistical analyses were undertaken on these extrapo-
lated data.
Statistical Software
SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc.), and Spotfire Plus 
version 8.2 (TIBCO, Inc.) were used for data analysis.
results
study participants
Results include data from 890 athletic exposures from 
16 football players; 4 players were dropped from analy-
sis because less than 20% of their athletic exposures 
were captured. For the season, there were 10 helmet-only 
practices, 29 shell practices, 27 full-pad practices, and 12 
games. Collapsed across all included participants, 75% of 
the participants’ athletic exposures were captured. Table 
1 contains the detailed number of captured athletic expo-
sures of each event type.
Number of hits per event
Helmet-only, shell, and full-pad practices and games 
all significantly differed in regard to the mean number 
of recorded impacts (greater than 10g threshold) that oc-
curred during these events (Bonferroni corrected p ≤ 0.05 
for all pairwise comparisons). Figure 1 shows the aver-
age impact rate for each subject per event type as well as 
the combined averages with 95% confidence intervals. 
Athletes received on average 10.5 (95% CI 7.6–14.5), 1.91 
(95% CI 1.5–2.4), and 1.4 (95% CI 1.1–1.8) times more 
impacts during games than they did during helmet-only, 
shell, and full-pad practices, respectively.
Number of impacts past thresholds
The distributions for severity of impact with respect to 
multiple linear acceleration thresholds differed between 
helmet-only, shell, and full-pad practices, and games (p < 
0.01 for all pairwise comparisons) (Fig. 2A). Similarly, the 
distributions for severity of impact with respect to multiple 
rotational acceleration thresholds differed between helmet-
only, shell, and full-pad practices, and games (p < 0.01 for 
all pairwise comparisons) (Fig. 2B). Threshold-by-thresh-
old post hoc pairwise comparisons, however, showed that 
at some specific linear and rotational acceleration thresh-
olds there were no differences in the mean number of im-
pacts between certain event types after Bonferroni mul-
tiple comparison Type I error rate correction (supplemental 
Tables S1 and S2). This finding was most evident for larger 
thresholds where the smaller sample size no longer differ-
entiated between different practice types or between full-
pad practices and games. Figure 2C shows, as a function 
of g-force threshold, the ratios of means for the number of 
impacts in which linear acceleration exceeded the defined 
g-force threshold for helmet-only practices versus games,

 practice type effects on head impact in collegiate football
shell practices versus games, and full-pad practices ver-
sus games. At lower thresholds of 20g and 30g, the mean 
number of impacts in full-pad practice events trended 
lower than game events, but was not significantly different. 
Figure 2D shows, as a function of the rad/s2 threshold, the 
ratios of means for the number of impacts in which the ro-
tational acceleration exceeded the defined rad/s2 threshold 
for helmet-only practices versus games, shell practices ver-
sus games, and full-pad practices versus games. At lower 
thresholds of 4000 rad/s2 and 6000 rad/s2, the mean num-
ber of impacts in full-pad practice events trended lower 
than game events but was not significantly different.
cumulative impact load per event
The Kaplan-Meier forms of the cumulative distribu-
tions for impact burden (a summation of the impacts, 
which are each weighted by severity) per athletic expo-
sure are shown in Fig. 3A with regard to linear accelera-
tion, and in Fig. 3B with regard to rotational acceleration. 
Linear acceleration cumulative distributions differed be-
tween the helmet-only, shell, and full-pad practices, and 
games (Bonferroni corrected p < 0.01 for all pairwise 
comparisons), with the median of the linear acceleration 
distribution being greatest for games, followed by full-pad 
practices, shell practices, and helmet-only practices (Fig. 
3C). The rotational acceleration cumulative distributions 
differed likewise based on practice type (Bonferroni cor-
rected p < 0.01 for all pairwise comparisons), with the 
median of the rotational acceleration distribution being 
greatest for games, followed by full-pad practices, shell 
practices, and helmet-only practices (Fig. 3D).
average impact severity
For an athletic event type, the average impact severity 
was defined as the geometric mean of the peak accelera-
tion per individual head impact within that event type. In 
terms of both linear and rotational acceleration, helmet-
only practices (21.7g, 3899 rad/s2) had a lower average im-
pact severity when compared with shell practices (28.0g, 
5485 rad/s2), full-pad practices (28.8g, 5605 rad/s2), and 
games (28.2g, 5560 rad/s2) (Fig. 4). However, the average 
impact severity did not differ between any comparisons of 
shell and full-pad practices and games.
cumulative impact load per season
The xPatch is not integrated into mandatory football 
gear, so a player may opt not to wear the sensor for a giv-
en athletic exposure. Table S3 presents the participants’ 
recorded data extrapolated to perfect compliance, with 
respect to cumulative impact load per season. Per player 
over a whole season, the estimated mean number of head 
impacts (> 10g) is 974 (maximum 2277); the mean cumu-
lative PLA is 29,233g (maximum 76,296g); and the mean 
cumulative PRA is 5,857,749 rad/s2 (maximum 16,174,965 
rad/s2). These data are provided for reference to published 
studies of head impact in football that have examined cu-
mulative impact per athletic season, rather than our pres-
ent focus on head impact per athletic event type.

type of equipment worn during a collegiate football prac-

tice affects the number and severity of head impacts ex-
perienced by the players. Helmet-only, shell, and full-pad 
practices, and games result in statistically distinct num-
bers of head impacts, with each succeeding event type re-
ceiving more impacts than the one before. With respect 
to both PLA and PRA, the ratio of means remains rela-
tively consistent across multiple impact-severity thresh-
olds. This finding indicates that the differences in event 
type impact burden are not dependent on a single arbitrary 
impact threshold, but are present across the spectrum of 
impact severities. Persistence of the findings across impact 
severities is important because a specific biomechanical 
definition of subconcussion remains uncertain. In football, 
subconcussion has commonly been studied using a PLA 
threshold greater than 10g–15g,6,9,11,26,36 but this threshold 
typically reflects a default setting on the accelerometer 
rather than representing a threshold with defined physi-
ological meaning.
The average impact severity is consistent across event 
types, with the exception of helmet-only practices. This 
finding indicates that the number of hits experienced dur-
ing each event type, rather than the average severity of im-
pacts that occur during the event, is the main driver of event 
type differences in impact burden per athletic exposure. In 
helmet-only practices, the slightly lower average impact 
severity may be a secondary contributor to the lower cu-
mulative impact burden. Our findings differ slightly from 
a prior study reporting a slightly higher impact severity 
for helmet-only practice (22.5g) and full-contact practice 
(22.7g) than for games/scrimmages (21.1g).26 The differ-
ences in measured impact severity possibly reflect a com-
bination of methodological differences in data acquisition 
and the practice philosophy of the coaches and players; 
however, the number of hits would still appear to be the 
primary source of differences in impact burden between 
event types. The data support our primary hypothesis that 
the impact burden per athletic exposure varies significant-
ly across different practice types. In addition, the general 
finding that impact per football practice is less than per 
football game supports the existing literature.6,22,37

 practice type effects on head impact in collegiate football
Different types of head impact sensors have individual 
strengths and weaknesses but share a common goal of us-
ing external accelerometers and gyroscopes to estimate 
forces experienced by the brain. The outputs of these sen-
sors are typically delivered as a synthesis of measurements 
from the sensor array that are mathematically transformed 
to a theoretical center of mass of the head. The impact 
sensor array used in our study was encased in an adhesive 
mastoid patch (xPatch), rather than the helmet-mounted 
sensors called HITS (Head Impact Telemetry System) that 
are commonly used in studies investigating biomechanical 
features of head impact in football.6,10,11,22,31 In collegiate 
football studies in which the HITS was used, the mean/
median number of head impacts per player per season 
ranged from 257 to 1354, the PLA per impact ranged from 
20.5g to 32.0g, and the PRA per impact ranged from 1355 
to 2213 rad/s2.6,11,13,26,30,31 The xPatch findings of 974 mean 
hits per season (> 10g) and 26.5g PLA per impact com-
pare favorably to the published HITS data, but a notable 
discrepancy exists with the xPatch finding of 5066 rad/s2 
PRA per impact. The source of this difference is currently 
unknown, without a direct comparison between the two 
sensor systems. The HITS may suffer from issues related 
to helmet fit and slippage;17 the xPatch may have issues 
related to skin movement over the mastoid process and 
sensor adhesion; and the method to calculate rotational ac-
celeration differs between the HITS and xPatch. Further 
season total information is presented in Table S3 for com-
parison with the existing literature, but the transformed 
values output by head-impact sensors used in natural envi-
ronments should be viewed skeptically. The use of relative 
impact comparisons throughout the present study is meant 
to offset this limitation of the technology.
limitations of the study
This study reports the findings from one team over the 
course of a single season. It has been shown that different 
teams can have different head impact profiles depending 
on their offensive scheme,22 and it is likely that a different 
practice philosophy may result in increased or decreased 
differences between different practice types. The distinc-
tion between practices with different levels of protective 
equipment may also be confounded by specific instruc-
tions given to the players for that practice type (i.e., no con-

tact, contact but no tackling to the ground, or full contact) 
and by the types of drills performed during the practice 
type. Although these confounding variables may affect 
the findings, it is common for coaches to tailor the equip-
ment to the type of practice and vice versa. For example, 
a coach is unlikely to allow full speed and full contact 
during a helmet-only or shell practice, because this would 
greatly increase the risk of injury to the players. Therefore, 
the level of protective equipment worn is generally a good 
proxy measure for the intensity of a practice.
conclusions
This study shows that the number of head impacts and 
impact burden during practice are categorically less than 
in games, and that the type of equipment worn during each

 practice type effects on head impact in collegiate football
practice is associated with different head impact profiles. 
These findings are important because the NCAA, while 
publicly committing to reduce the impact burden of col-
legiate football players, has struggled to find fair and ef-
fective ways to limit player contact. The NCAA has op-
tional practice guidelines that recommend “no more than 
two (2) live contact practices per week,” but there is no 
NCAA legislation that mandates limits on the number of 
full-contact practices (full pads or shell) during the regular 
season or postseason. To defend this position, the NCAA 
cites one unpublished presentation (Trulock S, Oliaro S: 
Practice contact. Presented at Safety in College Football 
Summit held in Atlanta, GA, on January 22, 2014) and a 
general lack of data on the topic.27 Effectively, the NCAA 
defers to the individual athletic conferences and teams re-
garding the regulation of football practices; both the Ivy 
League and Pacific-12 conferences have chosen to man-
date limits on in-season contact practices to 2 per week.27 
The National Football League, as a part of the 2011 col-
lective bargaining agreement with the National Football 
League Players Association, also restricts the number of 
contact practices to 14 over the course of the 16-game 
regular season.28 The present data suggest that similar 
regulations in college football would reduce the burden of 
head impact for thousands of athletes. While the research 
community should continue to investigate the cause and 
nature of these practice type differences, the potential hu-
man cost of leaving practice equipment unregulated seems 
unnecessarily high.
