Abstract
Time is a fundamental dimension of everyday experiences. We can unmistakably sense its
passage and adjust our behavior accordingly. Despite its ubiquity, the neuronal mecha-
nisms underlying the capacity to perceive time remains unclear. Here, in two experiments
using ultrahigh-field 7-Tesla (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we show
that in the medial premotor cortex (supplementary motor area [SMA]) of the human brain,
neural units tuned to different durations are orderly mapped in contiguous portions of the
cortical surface so as to form chronomaps. The response of each portion in a chronomap is
enhanced by neighboring durations and suppressed by nonpreferred durations represented
in distant portions of the map. These findings suggest duration-sensitive tuning as a possi-
ble neural mechanism underlying the recognition of time and demonstrate, for the first time,
that the representation of an abstract feature such as time can be instantiated by a topo-
graphical arrangement of duration-sensitive neural populations.
Author summary
Sensing the passage of time is a common experience of our everyday life activity. Even
without a watch, we can, for example, tell whether the bus we are waiting for is late. The
neuronal mechanism that enables us to sense the passage of time is largely unknown. Here,
we asked healthy human volunteers to discriminate between visual events of varying dura-
tions while we measured brain activity via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

 The results show that distinct portions of the supplementary motor area (SMA)—a region
of the cerebral cortex important for both motor preparation and time perception—respond
preferentially to different durations. The portions of the SMA responding to similar dura-
tions are in close spatial proximity on the cortex, and their response is greater for preferred
and neighboring durations and suppressed for distant ones. The spatial arrangement of
duration-selective portions of the SMA could be the mechanism that enables us to effi-
ciently sense that a certain duration has elapsed.
Introduction
Time is a particularly elusive dimension of everyday experiences. We cannot see or touch time;
nevertheless, we clearly sense its flow and adjust our behavior accordingly. When dancing, our
body entrains to the musical tempo. Even without a watch, we can detect when the bus we are
waiting for is late.
While a growing body of evidence highlights the contribution of many different brain
regions to temporal computations, the neuronal mechanisms underlying our capacity to per-
ceive time remain largely unknown [1][2].
Single-neuron recordings in animals suggest that the encoding of temporal information in
the millisecond/second range is achieved via duration-tuned mechanisms [3][4][5]. Duration-
selective cells have been observed in cats’ early visual cortex [5], in cats’ and bats’ primary audi-
tory cortex [6][7], and, more recently, in monkeys’ medial premotor and prefrontal cortices
[3][4][8]. In the human brain, the existence of such mechanisms has been recently suggested
by psychophysical studies [9][10] and by a single neuroimaging experiment [11]. Psychophysi-
cal studies show that the repeated presentation of a visual stimulus or an auditory rhythm of a
given duration (i.e., “adaptor”) affects the perceived duration of a subsequent visual stimulus
or rhythm (i.e., “after-effect”). After-effects are stronger if the temporal distance between the
“adaptor” and the judged stimulus is optimal, suggesting the existence of tuning profiles [9]
[10] for which the selectivity is highest for the preferred duration (PD) and slowly decays with
distance from it. Duration adaptation has also been shown to influence the activity of the infe-
rior parietal lobule (IPL) in the human brain. Neural activity in the IPL is suppressed for sti-
muli of the same duration and enhanced for stimuli of different durations [11].
However, previous studies in either the animal or the human brain have not clarified
whether neurons tuned to different durations have an ordered topographical arrangement in
duration-sensitive areas of the brain. Whether this ordered arrangement is a specific property
of single or multiple brain regions also remains unknown.
Neuronal tuning and topography are mechanisms widely used in the brain to represent sen-
sory information [12][13], including abstract features like quantities [14]. Showing the exis-
tence of a temporal topography could therefore be very important to gain insights on the
computational architecture underlying time perception and to link the representation of time
to that of other sensory features, such as stimulus orientation.
Results
To examine if chronotopic representations exist in the human brain, we used ultrahigh-field
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 7-Tesla (7T) in two distinct experiments. In
the first of these experiments (Exp 1), we measured brain activity while participants (N = 11)
decided whether the second stimulus (S2) of a pair was longer or shorter than the first stimulus
(S1; see Fig 1A). In this experiment, we used four different duration ranges (i.e., S1 = 0.2, 0.4,

and 90.6% ± 4.1%, respectively. Overall accuracy was 88.6% ± 3.7%. Although a one-way
repeated measures ANOVA with within-subject factor of S1 durations showed a significant
main effect (F3,30 = 4.824, P < 0.05), pairwise posthoc tests showed no significant difference
between the different combinations of S1 durations (all P values > 0.05, Bonferroni corrected
for multiple comparisons).
For the analysis of Exp 1, we used a mass-univariate General Linear Model (GLM)
approach. We used separate regressors for each of the four different duration ranges. These
regressors of interest modeled the offsets of the S1 duration and were convolved with the
canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF; see Materials and methods for more details
about the modeling of regressors of no interest). We used event offset because it was the
moment when the duration of a stimulus became available to participants.
We first identified the regions associated with the presentation of the four S1 durations
together. As expected from previous neuroimaging findings [15][16], these regions were
visual, parietal, and frontal cortices (see S1 Fig and S1 Table).
We then focused on the identification of the brain regions that were maximally activated
for each specific S1 duration and that clearly showed a topographical arrangement of dura-
tion-selective voxels.

duration ranges in the temporal task (PFWE < 0.05, cluster level corrected for multiple

(N = 11) overlaid on the inflated Dartel-11 template. The figure shows the cluster of vertices (i.e., voxels projected onto
the brain surface) classified according to a winner-take-all procedure based on statistical t-maps, as maximally
responsive to each of the four S1 durations (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 1 s). Each color codes a different label; the color scale goes
from red (shortest S1) to green (longest S1). Statistical threshold for t-maps was set to PFWE < 0.05 cluster-level
corrected for multiple comparisons across the whole brain. Duration-selective vertices were found in SMA (leftward
panel) but also in the IPS. The durations of the color bar are red = 0.2, orange = 0.4, yellow = 0.6, and green = 1 s. The
white lines give an example of the map borders, as they were drawn to estimate the wRD from either the P or the L
border in individual subjects. For the wRD computation, though, borders were drawn in each individual subject in
their native space. The size of the maps reported in the figure is the average size calculated across the 11 subjects when
their map was in a common Dartel space. The data can be found in S2 Data. A, anterior; CS, central sulcus; fMRI,

 comparisons across the whole brain; see also S2 Data). Each color codes the cluster of voxels
that was classified according to a winner-take-all procedure based on t-statistic maps, as maxi-
mally responsive to each of the different duration ranges. The color scale ranges from red, cor-
responding to voxels responsive to the shortest duration (0.2 s), to green, the voxels maximally
responsive to the longest duration (1 s).
As indicated by the gradual change of color in Fig 2, we found a topographic organization
of duration-sensitive voxels in the supplementary motor area (SMA; see leftward panels) and
in part of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS, see rightward panels) of the left hemisphere. In SMA,
this progression was in the rostro–caudal direction, with voxels sensitive to the shortest dura-
tion located in the anterior SMA and those sensitive to the longest duration in the posterior
part.
In the IPS, the progression was in the lateral–medial direction i.e., voxels maximally respon-
sive to the shorter duration were closer to the lateral border of the map compared to those sen-
sitive to the longer duration.
To quantitatively assess the spatial distribution of duration-selective voxels in SMA and IPS
during the temporal discrimination task, we analyzed both volumetric and surface data of each
individual subject (see Materials and methods for details).
At the surface level, for each subject and each duration-selective cluster of vertices (i.e., vox-
els projected onto the brain surface), we calculated the weighted relative distance (wRD) from
the posterior and the lateral borders of the chronomap for SMA and IPS, respectively (see
Materials and methods for details). Borders of the maps were identified in each individual sub-
ject in their native space.
Fig 3A (see also S1 Data) shows in the left SMA for each duration-selective cluster the full
distribution of individual wRD and their median value. In the figure, it is also displayed a fitted
slope based on these median values (for individual maps and individual slopes, see S2 Fig and
S3 Fig and S4 and S3 Data).
The plot shows, as expected from the visual inspection of the group-level brain map, that
the distance from the posterior border of the SMA is longer for vertices responsive to the
shortest duration (0.2 s) and becomes progressively shorter for vertices responsive to the lon-
ger duration range. This progression was also present in the majority of the subjects (for indi-
vidual maps, see S2 Fig and S4 Data), as revealed by the statistically significant analysis of the
wRD slopes (Wilcoxon rank sum test on individual slopes, for which we tested the existence of
a negative slope versus a slope equal to zero, P = 0.017; for a better appreciation of individual
slopes, see also S3 Fig and S3 Data).
To confirm the spatial progression of SMA chronomap, we also identified for each individ-
ual volumetric map the duration preferred by the majority of the activated voxels that laid at
different distances from the posterior border of the chronomap (individual chronomaps in the
subjects’ native space were parceled in volumetric bins of 1.5-mm width; for details, see Mate-
rials and methods). The relative distance from the posterior border of these preferred dura-
tions is shown in Fig 3C and S1 Data. As seen previously, the shorter the distance from the
posterior border, the greater the number of voxels preferring the longer duration ranges (dia-
monds in colder colors). The greater the distance from the posterior border, the greater the
number of voxels preferring the shorter duration ranges (diamonds in warmer colors). A simi-
lar result is shown in Fig 3B and S1 Data, in which we plot for each subject the weighted cen-
troids (wCntrs) of each duration-selective cluster (centroids were computed on data
normalized to a common Dartel space). Within the SMA, the centroids of the shortest-dura-
tion–selective cluster (red diamonds) were generally located anteriorly compared to the cen-
troids of the longest-duration–selective cluster (green diamonds).

 In the IPS, the topographical arrangement of voxels (i.e., from lateral to medial for short to
long durations) was apparent at the group level, but it was less consistently observed at the sin-
gle-subject level (for individual maps, see S4 Fig and S4 Data). Indeed, only five out of 11 sub-
jects showed the appropriate spatial distribution of duration-selective voxels. Moreover, when
we looked at the wRD, there was no statistically significant effect of the slope (Wilcoxon test
P = 0.737; see S3 Fig for individual slopes; see S5 Fig and S3 Data for preferred durations and
centroids).
Fig 3. Spatial progression of SMA chronomaps in Exp 1. Panel (A) shows for each duration-selective vertex the group median (biggest colored
diamonds), the full distribution of individual data (smaller diamonds), and the fitted slope of the wRD from the P border of the chronomap. wRD were
first computed for each individual subject on chronomaps overlaid on flattened surfaces in participant’s native space. The P border was chosen to be the
most posterior part of the precentral gyrus. (B) wCntrs for duration-selective voxels in SMA. 2D projection of wCntrs in the y-z plane. wCntrs are color

because not all subjects had the full range of duration-selective voxels. (C) Group average of preferred durations (y-axis) of voxels lying at different

 To examine the response tuning of the voxels to a given duration range, we looked at the
change of the hemodynamic response of these voxels for nonpreferred durations. Fig 4 (S1
Data) shows the hemodynamic response of duration-sensitive voxels for the left SMA. In each
duration-selective cluster, the hemodynamic response was normalized to the preferred dura-
tion (PD), i.e., the duration to which the cluster was maximally responsive to, based on t-statis-
tics maps. As shown in panel A, for all duration-selective clusters (i.e., colored lines), we
observed a modulation of the presented durations on the blood oxygenation level-dependent
(BOLD) response. Specifically, the hemodynamic response, which peaked during the presenta-
tion of the PD (see the diamonds in the plot), slowly decayed for durations distant from the
preferred one (PD versus PD ± 1, P < 0.03; PD versus PD ± 2, P < 0.002).
A similar result was obtained by plotting the normalized signal change of the shortest and
longest duration-selective clusters over the trial period, when either a shortest or a longest
duration was presented (see S6 Fig and S3 Data). As expected, after the stimulus offset, the
hemodynamic response rose at a similar time in the two clusters, for the two presented dura-
tions (second TR after stimulus offset). However, the signal had a greater amplitude for the
appropriate pair of stimulus and duration-selective cluster, e.g., the 0.2-s duration-selective
cluster when a 0.2-s stimulus was presented.
Similar results were obtained in the IPS (S7 Fig and S3 Data) where the BOLD response was
enhanced for preferred (PD) and neighboring (PD ±1) durations (PD versus PD ±1,
P < 0.009) and suppressed for durations far (PD ± 2) from the preferred one (PD versus
PD ± 2, P < 0.005).
In order to assess the robustness of Exp 1’s results, we ran an additional experiment (Exp 2,
N = 10) in which we used a similar temporal discrimination task of visual stimuli (i.e., partici-
pants judged which of the two successive visual stimuli [S1 and S2] lasted longer). Visual sti-
muli were Gabor patches changing in orientation (see Fig 5A). In Exp 2, we introduced three
main changes compared to Exp 1.
First, we used a broader range of durations, spanning from 0.2 to 3 s. Second, we used a
method of stimulus presentation that was highly regular, i.e., different duration ranges were
presented sequentially. We used pairs of stimuli (S1 and S2) varying in duration. In different
pairs, we tested different duration ranges, e.g., S1 = 0.2 versus S2 = 0.3 s in one pair and
S1 = 0.4 versus S2 = 0.6 s in a different pair (see Fig 5A). In each pair, we had a standard (T)
and a comparison duration (T + ΔT); in half of the trials, the standard duration was S1, and in
the other half, it was S2. The pairs were presented in a sequential manner, as to form cycles
(i.e., a cycle is a series of trials [N = 10] for which we tested 10 duration ranges). In ascending
cycles, we progressed from the shortest to the longest pair of stimuli; in descending cycles, it
was the opposite. This design allowed us to evaluate whether there was a gradual spatial shift in
cortical activation as the stimulus duration changed. Third, in addition to the temporal dis-
crimination task, participants performed a nontemporal task for which they judged the angu-
lar orientation of the same visual gratings. This task was included to evaluate the task
dependency of chronotopic representations.
In Exp 2, S1 and S2 stimuli were defined by different orientations (see Fig 5A and Materials
and methods for full details of the tasks). S1 was leftward and S2 was rightward oriented.
While keeping their main orientation, both S1 and S2 slightly changed their angular orienta-
tion. In the temporal task, participants judged which stimulus orientation was maintained for
longer time, whereas in the orientation task, they judged which orientation underwent the big-
gest angular change.
Behavioral data inside the MRI scanner did not reveal any significant performance differ-
ences across the different durations (see Fig 5B and S1 Data, main effect of duration F9 =

 1.303, P = 0.289) and the two tasks (main effect of task F1 = 0.309, P = 0.592; interaction effect
F1,9 = 0.539, P = 0.842).
At the brain level, based on Exp 1 results, we focused on the identification of chronomaps
in both SMA and IPS (for the details on the two regions of interest [ROI], see Materials and
methods).
The cyclical presentation of the events, the very short stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA),
together with the absence of jittering in interstimulus and intercycle intervals made this design
particularly suitable for the population Receptive Field (pRF) method of analysis. pRF is an
fMRI method of data analysis that is used to map response selectivity to any type of stimulus
feature (e.g., the spatial position of a visual object [17][18]). The idea behind pRF is that neuro-
nal receptive fields are a form of tuning functions. As pRF model, we used a one-dimensional
Gaussian curve with two parameters: μ, the stimulus duration, and σ, the spread of the Gauss-
ian. For the pRF modeling, we used the offset of all S1 durations, no matter whether S1 was a
standard or a comparison duration. This procedure led to the identification of 17 durations
(ranging from 0.2 to 3 s). For each time point of the fMRI timeseries, the overlap between the
Gaussian tuning models and the presented stimulus profiles were estimated (see Material and
methods for more details). The combination of Gaussian tuning models and the presented
stimulus profiles were convolved to HRF.

lines are different duration-selective voxels) for preferred and nonpreferred durations. On the x-axis are the four presented durations.
The BOLD signal in the duration-selective voxels is aligned to the presentation timings of the different duration ranges (i.e., second
volume after S1 offset). The colored diamonds represent the point in time when the hemodynamic response of duration-selective voxels
matched the presentation timing of the appropriate duration (e.g., red-labeled voxels when the shortest S1 duration is presented). The
color code is as in Fig 2. Normalization was performed first in each individual subject to the mean signal intensity across fMRI runs and
then for each duration-selective cluster to the signal associated to the PD. (B) Normalized BOLD response to PDs, neighboring (PD

 Fig 6 (see S2 Data) shows the projection on the cortical surface (medial part of Brodmann
Area 6 [BA 6]) of the estimated μ parameter at the group level. Different colors represent verti-
ces (i.e., voxels projected onto the cortical surface) selective to different duration ranges (i.e.,
vertices with different estimated μ).
As indicated by the gradual change of color in brain activations shown in Fig 6, we found a
topographic organization of duration-sensitive vertices in the left SMA replicating the results
of Exp 1. In addition to the first experiment, here, we observed chronotopic maps for a broader
range of durations, in both the left and the right hemisphere and for both the temporal and the
orientation task (see leftward and rightward panels of Fig 6).
Fig 5. Stimulus sequence and behavioral results of Exp 2. (A) Schematic representation of the stimulus sequence in a trial (Exp 2).
Within a trial, the sequence of orientation changes was fixed and was always leftward first, rightward second, and vertical last. Within
the two “main orientations” (left and right), the grating continuously changed its orientation at a rate of 5 Hz, and the range of
changes was between 30˚ and 45˚. Participants were asked to discriminate which of the two “main orientations” (leftward or
rightward) was displayed for longer time (time task) or to judge which one of them underwent the biggest change (orientation task).
S is standard and C the comparison duration. There were 10 standard durations, ranging from 0.2 to 2 s, in step of 0.2 s. The
presentation order of S and C was randomized and counterbalanced across trials. In half of the trials, S1 was a standard; in the other
half, it was a comparison duration. The comparison duration was 50% of the standard. The vertical orientation signaled the time to
make the response (by pressing one of two response keys on a keypad), and it was also the intertrial interval (1.37 s). (B) Average

 As in Exp 1, this progression was in the rostro–caudal direction within the SMA, with verti-
ces sensitive to the shorter duration (vertices in warmer colors) located in the anterior and
those sensitive to the longer duration (vertices in colder colors) in the posterior SMA.
In analogy with Exp 1, we looked at the spatial progression of chronomaps using three dis-
tinct indexes: wRD, PDs, and wCntrs (see Materials and methods for details). All of these
indexes were computed for each individual subject. While wRD and PDs were estimated in the
subjects’ native space, the wCntrs were estimated on data normalized to a common Dartel
space. PDs and wCntrs were calculated at volumetric level, whereas wRD was calculated at sur-
face level.
The PDs and the centroids show results that are consistent with what was observed for the
maps at the group level. For the PDs (Fig 7A and Fig 8A for time and orientation task, respec-
tively; see also S1 Data), we found for both tasks and both hemispheres that the voxels lying
closer to the posterior border of the chronomap preferred the longer durations, whereas those
lying furthest preferred the shortest duration. For the centroids, in both hemispheres and
tasks, in the majority of the tested subjects, the clusters of voxels selective to the shorter dura-
tions had centroids located more anteriorly (see the y-axis, diamonds in warmer color) with
respect to the voxels responsive to the longer durations (diamonds in colder color).
Although in a visual inspection (see Fig 6, Fig 7A and 7B, and Fig 8A and 8B) of the group-
level results chronotopic maps seemed to include the whole range of durations tested, the anal-
ysis on the wRD revealed an interesting dissociation between sub- and suprasecond durations
in the spatial progression of the maps (see Fig 7C and Fig 8C). An analysis on individual slopes

vertices (i.e., voxels projected onto the cortical surface) selective to different duration ranges (i.e., vertices with different estimated μ). We show the results of the
group (average of 10 subjects) for the 17 estimated μ. The μ are the 17 durations presented in the 10 different trial types (S1 duration was either a standard or a
comparison duration). The color scale goes from red, i.e., shortest duration (0.2 s), to dark blue, i.e., longest duration (3 s). The white lines give an example of
the map borders, as they were drawn to estimate the wRD in the individual subjects. For the wRD computation, borders were drawn in each individual subject
in their native space. The size of the maps reported in the figure is the average size calculated across the 10 subjects when their maps were in a common Dartel
space. On the left-hand side are time maps in time task; on the right-hand side are time maps in the orientation task. The data can be found in S2 Data. A,

 based on wRD and calculated for sub- and suprasecond durations (Wilcoxon sum rank test)
showed the presence of a significant difference (i.e., negative slope versus slope equal to zero)
for subsecond durations in the temporal and orientation tasks for both the left and right hemi-
spheres (P < 0.001). For the suprasecond durations, the slope was either flat or positive (left
SMA in time and orientation tasks P < 0.001). No statistically significant difference was
observed between tasks (neither for sub- or suprasecond durations P > 0.6). This result shows
that the spatial progression in SMA chronomaps is clear for subsecond duration in bilateral
SMA and for both the time and the orientation tasks.
For individual maps, see S8–S11 Figs and S4 Data. For left and right SMA in the temporal
task, see S8 Fig and S9 Fig. For the left and right SMA in the orientation task, see S10 Fig and
S11 Fig. For a better appreciation of individual slopes, see also S12 Fig and S3 Data.
Within the IPS, we did not find a clear topography, neither at the group nor at the single
subject level (see S13 Fig and S4 Data).
To examine the response tuning of duration-sensitive voxels in the second experiment, we
looked at the variation of the hemodynamic response as a function of the presented duration,
i.e., preferred versus nonpreferred durations. Fig 9 (see S1 Data) shows the normalized hemo-
dynamic response of SMA duration-selective voxels to PD and neighboring durations (PD ± 1,
see darker shades), as opposed to the response to distant durations (PD ± 2, see lighter shades).
Given the limited number of repetitions for each of the 17 presented durations, to plot the sig-
nal change, we grouped the durations according to the 10 different trial types (i.e., 10 pairs of
durations). The normalized BOLD response is plotted for both time (upper panel) and orienta-
tion tasks (lower panel). The bar plot shows that for the majority of duration-selective voxels,
activity was enhanced for preferred (as expected) and neighboring durations and suppressed
for more distant durations (see Fig 9). Since there was no difference in the tuning analysis of
left and right hemispheres, the plot shows the average tuning of left and right SMA. As a com-
plementary check of the duration tuning, we looked at the normalized signal change of the
shortest- and the longest-duration–selective clusters of voxels over the time of a cycle (i.e., 44
seconds/22 TRs; see S14 Fig and S3 Data). For both clusters, the hemodynamic response
peaked and dropped at the appropriate times in a cycle, i.e., early in the cycle for the shortest-
duration–selective cluster and later in the cycle for the longest-duration–selective cluster. The
same pattern, although less clear, was present for the orientation task.
At this point, it is worth emphasizing here that in both experiments, we observed a certain
degree of variability in SMA chronomaps across subjects. Fig 10 (see S2 Data) shows for Exp 1
(panel A) and Exp 2 (panel B) the SMA chronomaps in two “ideal” subjects, i.e., subjects with
an anterior-short to posterior-long spatial progression. This progression was present in seven
out of 11 subjects in Exp 1 (left SMA) and in nine out of 10 subjects in Exp 2 (bilateral SMA;
see S2 Fig and S8–S11 Figs for the SMA maps of all subjects).

voxels with different duration selectivity; diamonds with the same color are the different subjects (n = 10). This value

 To investigate whether the individual variability in the spatial progression of the SMA
chronomaps was linked to the behavioral performance in the temporal task, we correlated
(using Kendal’s tau correlation coefficient) the slope of the wRD measured in SMA (i.e., left
SMA for Exp 1 and bilateral SMA for Exp 2) with two behavioral indexes of temporal perfor-
mance: accuracy and coefficient of variation (i.e., CV = standard deviation/duration). The
results (see S15 and S16 Figs and S3 Data) showed that the better the spatial progression of
the map (i.e., steeper negative slope), the more accurate and less variable the subject’s perfor-
mance is. While the result is very robust for Exp 1 (for accuracy: tau = −0.64, P < 0.05; for CV:
tau = 0.64, P < 0.05; S15 Fig), it is not statistically significant for Exp 2 (accuracy SMA left:
tau = −0.25, SMA right: tau = 0.15; CV SMA left: tau = 0.15, SMA right: tau = −0.15; S16 Fig).
Finally, in order to check whether SMA chronomaps represent duration in a relative or
absolute fashion, we compared the spatial distribution of the maps in the two experiments. Fig
11 shows the SMA chronomaps of the left hemisphere in the two experiments (data are now in
a common space, i.e., Dartel template computed on the high-resolution anatomical images of
the 21 subjects). The figure shows that in Exp 2, for which we used a wider range of durations,
the chronomap has a bigger size (121 versus 99 mm), and the duration-selective clusters that
are common in the two experiments are anteriorly shifted (see Fig 11B and S1 Data; 0.2 s =
+7.8 mm, 0.4s = −1.4 mm, 0.6s = +10 mm, 1s = +13 mm). As a consequence of this shift, only
a small proportion of vertices had the same selectivity across the two experiments (on average
is the 5% of total number of voxels selective for a given duration). This last result suggests that
SMA chronomaps represent durations in a relative rather than an absolute manner.
We also compared the size of the different duration-selective clusters in the two experi-
ments (see S17A–S17C Fig and S3 Data). In Exp 1, the four clusters were equally represented
(Wilcoxon rank sum test P > 0.23). In Exp 2, for both tasks, the size of the 17 duration-selec-
tive clusters was unequal, i.e., the shortest (0.2 s) and the longest (3 s) durations were more
numerous than the intermediate ones (from 0.8 to 2 s, for all durations, P < 0.05; ANOVA
task x durations; effect of durations F = 12.69, P < 0.01).
Discussion
To summarize, we showed with two independent data sets, paradigms, and methods of data
analysis that different portions of SMA responded preferentially to different durations. Dura-
tion selectivity had a clear topographical organization in the rostro–caudal direction for short
and long durations, respectively. Although chronotopic maps were observed across a wide
range of durations (from 0.2 to 3 s), the topographical arrangement of duration-selective verti-
ces was better for subsecond durations. Chronotopic maps were observed not only at the
group level but also, with a certain degree of variability, at the single-subject level. The individ-
ual variability of the maps seemed to be linked to participants’ temporal performance, i.e., the
more accurate and precise the performance, the better the spatial progression of the map.
Chronotopic maps were also task independent; maps were indeed found when time was

 available, but it was task irrelevant. At the tuning level, we found that the hemodynamic
response in duration-selective voxels was enhanced by neighboring durations and suppressed
by durations far from the preferred one. Finally, SMA chronomaps represented durations in a
relative rather than absolute manner; the size of the map and the tuning of the duration-selec-
tive clusters changed with changes of the duration range tested.
Neuronal tuning and topography are encoding mechanisms widely used in neurons to rep-
resent sensory and motor information [13][19] and even more abstract features like quantities

 [14]. This topographic organization, which can have a certain degree of redundancy in the
brain (e.g., the multiple visual spatial maps), is thought to have a computational benefit, e.g.,
improving the efficiency of neural communication [20]. In the context of temporal perception,
given the potentially unlimited duration span, a mechanism of this sort can be beneficial when
multiple durations have to be simultaneously represented and recognized. The observation
that SMA chronomaps adjust their tuning to the duration range at hand, although is not yet
conclusive and needs further testing, is nonetheless a result in line with this hypothesis of effi-
cient coding of multiple durations.
Chronomaps have been identified for the first time in human SMA. Duration-selective cells
have been previously reported in monkeys’ medial premotor cortex [3][4]. The present study
extends this representational format to humans and shows that duration-selective units in this
region are topographically organized along the anterior-to-posterior axis. Moreover, while the
presence of duration-selective units in monkeys’ premotor cortex was exclusively associated
with motor-timing behavior, our study shows the presence in human premotor cortex of dura-
tion-selective mechanisms in a purely temporal perceptual task.
In humans, duration-selective mechanisms have been recently suggested by an fMRI study
showing duration adaptation effects in the activity of the inferior parietal lobule (i.e., the supra-
marginal gyrus) [11]. Activity in this region is suppressed when consecutive stimuli have the
same duration. Our data support this finding and show the presence of duration-selective
mechanisms in a closer location, i.e., the IPS, although in the left rather than the right hemi-
sphere. However, our data go beyond this previous finding by showing a) the existence of
duration-selective activity for a wider range of durations, b) duration selectivity not only in the
IPS but also in the SMA, and, c) most importantly, we showed that only activity in the SMA is
topographically organized in a way that neuronal units selective to similar durations occupy
contiguous portions of the cortical surface so as to form chronomaps.
Compared to our study, Hayashi and colleagues [11] failed to find adaptation effects in
SMA. The lack of this effect can be explained by a fundamental methodological difference
between the two studies. Hayashi and colleagues (2015) focused their fMRI analysis on the S2
of a pair, a stimulus immediately followed by a motor response. It could be therefore possible
that in SMA, the repetition-suppression signal was masked by the ramping signal of the motor
preparation. Our study instead focused on the brain response associated with the S1 of the
pair; a response that is well dissociated from a motor preparation–related signal. We therefore
believe that our method of analysis, being more focused on the encoding stage of the task, was
better suited to reveal the contribution of SMA.
The presence of topography in SMA but not in IPS may indicate that duration selectivity in
different brain regions (IPS and SMA) serves different purposes along the process leading to
duration judgments. Our hypothesis is that duration-selective activations in the premotor cor-
tex may reflect an active reconstruction of temporal signals coming from different regions of

on statistical t-maps (T > 3.13). We computed four different t-maps for each of the four S1 durations (PFWE < 0.05,
cluster level corrected for multiple comparisons across the whole brain). For the maps of whole sample (N = 11) of
subjects, see S2 Fig. (B) For two subjects of Exp 2, we show the left and the right SMA chronomap with the A and P

 the brain (e.g., visual or parietal areas) [21][2][22]. One can think of chronomaps in SMA as a
temporal read-out, a later stage of duration encoding in which duration information becomes
finally available and decision-making takes place. The IPS duration selectivity, which lacks a
clear topography [11], may represent an intermediate stage in which duration signals coming
from low-level sensory regions are automatically organized. A support to this hypothesis
comes from the observation that the perturbation of right supramarginal gyrus activity via
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) affects time representations in the SMA [22].
Two further observations are in line with the idea that chronotopic maps do not represent a
low-level stage of temporal processing: the anatomical location of the maps and the link
between spatial progression of the maps and both accuracy and precision of temporal judg-
ments. Chronomaps were mainly observed in SMA and neither in the parietal nor in sensory
regions. SMA has been implicated in a variety of timing tasks [16][23][24] with a range of
durations spanning from a few hundreds of milliseconds to a few seconds [25][26] and with
stimuli from different sensory modalities [27][28][29]. It is therefore likely that this area con-
stitutes an “amodal” and “high-level” core of a timing network in which duration is repre-
sented in an abstract form independent of specific sensory modality or motor behavior. The
correlation between spatial progression of the maps and performance is in line with a previous
fMRI study showing a correlation between the hemodynamic response in SMA and the per-
ceived duration (i.e., greater BOLD response led to time overestimation) [30].
The role of SMA as “amodal” and “high-level” time read-out is also in line with a growing
body of evidence showing a tight link between motor planning and visual time perception [31]
[32][33]. One of those studies [32], for example, shows that the preparation of isometric con-
tractions and real movements of the hand biases the time perception of visual events, i.e., time
perception expands for hand movements that point away from the body and compresses for
movements toward the body. SMA, for its role in both time perception and action planning,
likely plays a key role in this temporal sensory-motor integration.
At this point, we would like to emphasize here that even if chronomaps are found in SMA
and duration tuning is observed in both SMA and IPS, we still believe that time perception is
the result of the activity of a wide network of brain regions, including sensory [21,34], motor
[30,35], and associative cortices [15,36].
SMA chronomaps were also observed during the orientation discrimination task when the
temporal dimension of the stimuli was task irrelevant. This last result may at first glance
appear contradictory to the link between quality of the maps and behavioral performance.
However, we would like to point out here that the orientation discrimination task required
participants to attend the stimulus orientation’s changes over time. It may therefore be possible
that while appreciating stimulus orientation, participants also attended to the temporal dimen-
sion of the stimuli. That could be indeed the reason why we observed maps in the orientation
task. More research would be necessary to better specify the role of attention in modulating
chronomaps’ activity. In particular, it would be interesting to check whether the attention
payed to the stimulus’s duration, even when task irrelevant, depends on the fact that partici-
pants know that in each experimental session, they are going to judge both the time and the
orientation of the stimuli. In other words, it would be important to see whether SMA chrono-
maps are present when participants are exclusively engaged in a nontemporal task.

 Chronomaps covered the whole length of SMA, from SMA-proper to pre-SMA. The spatial
progression was in the rostro–caudal direction, with clusters preferring the shorter duration
located anteriorly compared to those preferring longer durations.
This progression does not fit any of the known motor or cognitive functional speciali-
zations of SMA. In the time domain, pre-SMA is engaged preferentially by perceptual tim-
ing tasks and by timing of sequences, whereas SMA-proper is preferentially recruited by
motor-timing tasks and by timing of single events [37–39]. In the motor domain, pre-
SMA is often linked with self-initiated movements, with response inhibition or task
switching, whereas SMA-proper with stimulus driven movements and motor preparation
[40]. A somatotopically arranged body map is also present in SMA. Stimulation studies
conducted in nonhuman primates show that movements of the hind limb are evoked from
caudal sites, whereas forelimbs and oro-facial movements are evoked from more rostral
sites [41][42]. Linking the spatial progression of the chronomaps with any of the above-
mentioned distinctions is rather difficult. More research is needed to clarify the relation-
ship between chronomaps and the well-known functional properties of SMA in both the
time and the motor domain. In addition, further studies are warranted for clarifying
whether chronomaps reported here are linked to a specific sensory modality or a specific
temporal task or whether they represent perceived or physical duration or if maps can be
distorted by pharmacological manipulations or learning.
An interesting observation came from Exp 2 in which a wider range of durations was tested.
By quantifying the spatial progression of the maps, we found that the rostro–caudal spatial
progression worked better for subsecond rather than suprasecond durations. This result is in
line with a few psychophysical [43,44] and neuroimaging observations [26,45], suggesting the
existence of distinct mechanisms and neuronal substrates for the processing of durations
above and below the second.
Duration-selective units were responsive to neighboring durations and exhibited the stron-
gest suppression to durations distant from the preferred one. This seems to suggest a Gauss-
ian-like type of response profile, in which neuronal units tuned to similar durations have
overlapping tuning curves. This tuning profile is also in line with the behavioral effects
obtained with duration adaptation paradigms in which an optimal proximity between “adap-
tor” and test duration leads to stronger repulsive effects [9]. In analogy with spatial vision or
audition (e.g., visual orientation [13] or auditory pitch [46]), the tuning profiles observed here
may serve the function of enhancing the discriminability of durations by suppressing the activ-
ity for different durations.
In summary, we found a topographic representation of time in the human SMA, an area
that has been previously identified as a “time” region. Our findings of chronomaps clarify the
nature of duration information represented there and, most importantly, indicate duration
tuning and topography as possible mechanisms for duration read-out.

 Stimuli and procedure
In Exp 1, we used a temporal discrimination task of visual durations. Visual stimuli were sinu-
soidal Gabor patches (100% contrast, spatial frequency of 1.9 cycles/degree, Gaussian envelope
with standard deviation of 2.2 degrees, diameter of approximately 9 degrees) with a circular
hole (diameter 0.6 degrees at the center of the Gabor) displayed at the center of the screen
around a central fixation spot (a black disk 0.5 degrees of diameter at a viewing distance of 90
cm) on a gray background. In each trial, two Gabor patches (S1 and S2) were sequentially pre-
sented with a variable interstimulus interval ranging between 4 and 5.2 s in 0.08 s steps. The
two stimuli were followed by a response cue, i.e., a red fixation spot of 2-s duration (see Fig
1A). S1 and S2 varied in orientation and duration, although only duration was task relevant.
The duration of S1 could be 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 1 s and its orientation 36, 72, 108, and 144
degrees. S2 could be either shorter or longer in duration than S1. The duration of S2 was lon-
ger or shorter by a constant Weber ratio of 0.4 (e.g., if S1 was 0.2 s, S2 was either 1.6 or 3.6 s),
whereas the orientation of S2 was a value randomly chosen from the four possible orientations
used for S1 (i.e., 36, 72, 108, or 144 degrees). The combination of duration and orientation
lead to 16 different types of S1 stimuli. Each stimulus type for S1 was presented only once in
each fMRI run.
Participants were asked to judge whether the duration of S2 was shorter or longer than S1.
Participants made their responses by pressing one of two buttons on a response pad. They
used their right index finger to express the choice “S2 shorter than S1” and their right middle
finger for the “S2 longer than S1” responses. Participants were instructed to be as accurate as
possible (no emphasis was put on reaction times) and to fixate at the center of the screen while
performing the duration discrimination task. They were also requested to ignore the orienta-
tion changes of the stimulus and to not use counting strategies to estimate duration.
Each fMRI run contained 16 trials, and the total duration of each run was 3 min and 51 s.
We collected 18 fMRI runs in two separate sessions (9 runs per session). The second session
was performed 1–3 days after the first session. The data of this first experiment are partially
shared with another study [47].
In Exp 2, two tasks were used: a temporal discrimination and an orientation discrimination
task. The stimuli and the task structure were identical in the two tasks; the only difference was
that the stimulus feature participants were asked to attend (duration versus orientation). The
stimulus was a sine wave grating (size = 400 by 400 pixels, 8.01 degree of visual angle at viewing
distance of 90 cm; spatial frequency was 0.05 cycle/pixel), drifting at a speed of 1 cycle per sec-
ond and displayed at varying angular orientations. Within a trial, the sequence of orientation
changes was fixed and was always leftward first, rightward second, and vertical last (Fig 1C).
Within the two “main orientations” (leftward–rightward), the grating continuously changed
its orientation at a rate of 5 Hz (an orientation change each 0.2 s), and the range of changes
was between 30˚ and 45˚. The amount of time the grating maintained its “main” orientation
defined a temporal interval. During the temporal discrimination task, participants judged
which of the two “main orientations” (leftward or rightward) was maintained for a longer
time. In the orientation discrimination task, participants judged which of the two “main orien-
tations” underwent the biggest angular change. In this manner, the physical stimuli were iden-
tical, and the amount of attention paid to them was equated across tasks. The only difference
between tasks was the instruction given to the participants (attend to duration versus attend to
orientation changes). The vertical orientation signaled the time to make the response (by
pressing one of two response keys on a keypad), and it was also the intertrial interval. The
duration of the vertical orientation was kept constant (1.37 s), whereas the duration of the two

 For each trial, there was always a standard (T) and a comparison duration (T + ΔT). The
duration of the comparison was a constant proportion of the standard (i.e., 50% of the stan-
dard, Weber ratio was equal to 0.5). The presentation order of standard and comparison (i.e.,
standard first, comparison second or vice versa) was randomized and counterbalanced across
trials. Half of the time, S1 was a standard, and the other half, it was a comparison duration. We
used 10 different standard durations, ranging from 0.2 to 2 s in steps of 0.2 s, one for each trial.
The full combination of standards and comparisons resulted in the following 10 pairs of dura-
tions: 1: 0.2–0.3 s, 2: 0.4–0.6 s, 3: 0.6–0.9 s, 4: 0.8–1.2 s, 5: 1.0–1.5 s, 6: 1.2–1.8 s, 7: 1.4–2.1 s, 8:
1.6–2.4 s, 9: 1.8–2.7 s, and 10: 2.0–3.0 s.
The overlap between duration pairs was a consequence of choosing comparison durations
that were 50% of the standard duration. We chose such a relatively high Weber fraction to
make sure that the difference between standard and comparison duration was clearly per-
ceived. Since we analyzed the brain response at the offset of S1 duration and since S1 could be
either standard or comparison, we were able to capture the signal correlated to 17 different
durations independently from the pairs they belonged to.
While the grating was displayed for a standard and a comparison duration, its angular ori-
entation changed at a rate of 5 Hz. The angular change was one of 12 pseudo-randomly chosen
values ranging from 30˚ to 45˚ (in logarithmic steps, base 10). It is worth emphasizing here
that since the orientation changes were chosen pseudo-randomly, sometimes the same orien-
tation could be displayed more than once (maximum number of allowed repetitions of the
same orientation was three). Therefore, the number of orientation changes was not entirely
predictive of the duration of the stimulus.
The differences between rightward and leftward orientation could be 5˚, 7˚, 9˚, or 11˚. We
chose these different values based on the results of a purely behavioral pilot study for which we
tested both temporal and orientation discrimination tasks. The angular differences chosen
were those leading to discrimination accuracy similar to the temporal task.
Both tasks were structured in “ascending” and “descending” cycles. Each cycle comprised
10 trials and lasted 44 s. “Ascending” cycles started with the shortest duration pair (i.e., 0.2–0.3
s, first trial) and ended with the longest pair (i.e., 2–3 s, the tenth trial). In descending cycles, it
was the reverse (i.e., the first trial had the longest and the tenth the shortest pair). The time
interval between cycles was 2.03 s; during this interval, the grating was in vertical orientation.
In both tasks, subjects were responding using either the index or the middle finger of their
right hand. In each fMRI run, there were 10 cycles. There were two separate runs for “descend-
ing” and “ascending” cycles (one run each) and two separate runs for the temporal and the ori-
entation discrimination tasks. The order of the tasks was counterbalanced across subjects (i.e.,
half of the participants performed the two time runs first; the other half performed the two ori-
entation runs first). Each participant thus performed a total of four fMRI runs (220 fMRI vol-
umes each).
Behavioral data analysis
In Exp 1, for each participant, we took the percentage of performance accuracy for the four dif-
ferent S1 durations, and we entered these values in a one-way repeated measures ANOVA.
In Exp 2, for each participant, we took the percentage of performance accuracy for the 10
different duration pairs in the two tasks and submitted them to a task (time, orientation) ×
durations (10 durations pairs) within subject ANOVA.
For both experiments, the alpha level was set to 0.05. As posthoc test, we used the Bonfer-
roni test.

 MRI acquisition and analyses
MRI acquisition.
The mapping of the selectivity of the neural responses necessitated high
spatial resolution of the functional data. The increased signal-to-noise ratio and available
BOLD associated with ultrahigh magnetic field systems (>3 T) allowed the use of smaller
voxel sizes in fMRI [48]. In addition, the spatial specificity of the BOLD signal is improved
because the signal strength of venous blood is reduced due to a shortened relaxation time,
restricting activation signals to cortical gray matter [48]. Therefore, we employed high-resolu-
tion, 7T fMRI for the functional maps.
In both experiments, BOLD functional imaging was performed using an actively shielded,
head-only 7T MRI scanner (Siemens, Germany), equipped with a head gradient insert (AC84,
80 mT/m max gradient strength; 350 mT/m/s slew rate) and 32-channel receive coil with a
tight transmit sleeve (Nova Medical, Massachusetts, United States of America).
In Exp 1, time course series of 169 volumes were acquired for each run, using the 3D-EPI-
CAIPI sequence [49]. The spatial resolution was 2.0 mm isotropic, the volume acquisition
time was 1,368 ms, the flip angle was 14 degrees, the repetition time (TR) 57 ms and the echo
time (TE) 26 ms, and the bandwidth 2,774 Hz/Px. The matrix size was 106 x 88 x 72, resulting
in a field of view of 210 (AP) x 175 (RL) x 144 (FH) mm. An undersampling factor 3 and CAI-
PIRINHA shift 1 were used. Slices were oriented transversally with the phase-encoding direc-
tion left–right. For the GRAPPA reconstruction, 42 x 45 reference lines were acquired. For
each individual, a total of 3,042 volumes (169 volumes per run, 18 runs) were analyzed.
High-resolution whole-brain MR images were also obtained using the MP2RAGE (magne-
tization prepared rapid gradient echo) pulse sequence optimized for 7T [50] (voxel size = 1.0 x
1.0 x 1.0 mm, matrix size 256 x 256 x 176, TI1/TI2 = 750/2,350 ms, α1/α2 = 4/5 degrees,
TRMP2RAGE/TR/TE = 5,500/6.5/2.84 ms).
In Exp 2, fMRI data were acquired with a continuous EPI pulse sequence with sinusoidal
read-out (1.5 × 1.5 mm in-plane resolution, slice thickness = 1.5 mm, TR = 2,000 ms, TE = 25
ms, flip angle = 47˚, slice gap = 1.57 mm, matrix size = 148 × 148, field of view 222 × 222 mm,
40 oblique slices covering most of occipital, parietal, and premotor regions). In each fMRI run,
we acquired 220 fMRI volumes. A T1-weighted high-resolution 3D anatomical image (resolu-
tion = 1 × 1 × 1 mm, TR = 5,500 ms, TE = 2.84 ms, slice gap = 1 mm, matrix size = 256 × 240,
field of view = 256 × 240) was acquired for each subject using the MP2RAGE pulse sequence.
For each participant, an additional whole-brain EPI image (a single volume with 80 slices and
TR = 4,000 ms and otherwise identical parameters to the functional data) was acquired in
order to aid the coregistration between the EPI images and the individual MP2RAGE. The EPI
sequence used in Exp 2 did not allow whole-brain coverage. Based on the results of Exp 1, we
chose to place the 6-cm thick imaging slab so as to cover the occipital, parietal, and premotor
cortices.
fMRI preprocessing.
For both experiments, functional imaging data were preprocessed
using the statistical parametric mapping toolbox (SPM12, Wellcome Department of Imaging
Neuroscience, University College London). In Exp 1, the EPI volumes acquired in each session
were realigned to the mean of the session and then coregistered to the T1-weighted image
acquired in the same session. In order to perform group level analysis (see Fig 2), the realigned
and coregistered images were then normalized to the averaged DARTEL template (diffeo-
morphic anatomical registration through exponentiated lie algebra [51]) and smoothed with a
2-mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel. To perform surface-based analysis, data
were kept in the subject’s space, i.e., after realignment and coregistration to the T1-weighted
image, data were then directly smoothed with a 2-mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian
kernel (Fig 3A and Fig 4).

 In Exp 2, the EPI volumes acquired in each session were slice time corrected, realigned to
the mean of the session, and coregistered first to the whole-brain EPI image and subsequently
to the T1-weighted image acquired in the same session. Since the sequence used for Exp 1 was
a 3D-EPI-CAIPI (i.e., the whole k-space was acquired at once, with no time lags), only in Exp
2 data were slice time corrected. In order to performed volumetric analyses and to visualize
the group-level pRF results, a DARTEL temple was also created for Exp 2.
GLM analysis. Exp 1 data were analyzed using a GLM approach. The fMRI time series
were first analyzed in each single subject. Each single subject model included 18 runs/session
with six event types in each session. These comprised the four different S1 durations (each
event was time locked to the offset of S1), a fifth event time locked to the onset of S2 (compari-
son duration), and a sixth event time locked to the onset of the participants’ response. The
duration of the events was set to zero.
All events were convolved to the canonical HRF. We used event offset as onset of the GLM
model because it was the moment when the duration of a stimulus became available to partici-
pants. Moreover, by modeling event offset, we minimized the contamination arising from the
temporal integration of visual responses.
The linear models included also the motion correction parameters as effects of no interest.
The data were high-pass filtered (cutoff frequency = 0.0083 Hz). In order to see brain activity
correlated to the different S1, for each subject, we estimated four contrasts, one for each S1.
These contrasts also averaged parameter estimates across the 18 runs.
In order to test the existence of chronomaps in the group, the four contrast images esti-
mated in each subject were then entered into a second-level ANOVA for which we performed
again four different contrasts (one for each S1 duration). The statistical threshold was set to
P < 0.05 FWE cluster-level corrected for multiple comparisons across the entire brain volume
(cluster size estimated at a voxel level threshold P uncorrected = 0.001).
Correction for nonsphericity [52] was used to account for possible differences in error vari-
ance across conditions and any non-independent error terms for the repeated measures.
To appreciate the existence of chronomaps, the four t-maps, obtained either at single sub-
ject or at group level, were then used to classify the voxels according to their preference to one
of the four different duration ranges. Voxels were classified according to a winner-take-all
rule, e.g., voxels with the greatest T value (threshold was set to T > 3.13) for the shortest dura-
tion range (0.2 s) were classified as responsive to that duration range and labeled with number
1. We created four different labels, and each label was associated with a specific color for visu-
alization purposes.
pRF analysis.
Data from Exp 2 were analyzed using the pRF method. The pRF analysis
was performed with the SamSrf toolbox for pRF mapping (https://figshare.com/articles/
SamSrf_toolbox_for_pRF_mapping/1344765/22).
This toolbox implements a method of analysis similar to the one used in several studies [14]
[17][18][53]. We performed the pRF analysis on two distinct ROIs: BA 6 and IPS. The ROIs
were based on the Freesurfer software’s Broadmann and Destrieux atlases. (http://surfer.nmr.
mgh.harvard.edu/). For each subject, the pRF analysis was performed on slice time-corrected,
realigned, coregistered, and smoothed images.
The idea behind pRF is that neuronal receptive fields are a form of tuning functions that
reflect specific stimulus properties. For each subject, pRFs were modeled as one-dimensional
Gaussians with two parameters: μ, the stimulus duration, and σ, the spread of the pRF.
The pRF tuning function used was a Gaussian changing linearly over time. The reason we
chose a linear pRF model is that the durations presented were spaced linearly.
For the pRF modeling, we used the offset of all S1 durations no matter whether S1 was a
standard or a comparison duration. This procedure led to the identification of 17 durations

 (i.e., 0.2. 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.8, 2, 2.1, 2.4, 2.7, and 3 s). For each time
point (i.e., each TR) of our fMRI time series and each vertex of the ROIs, the method estimates
the overlap between the Gaussian tuning model of a given μ and the presented durations. The
combination of Gaussian tuning model and presented duration was convolved to HRF. A
coarse-to-fine optimization approach then determined the optimal pRF parameters for which
the goodness-of-fit of the predicted time series to the observed data was maximized. Vertices
with a goodness of fit, R2 > 0.1, were included in all further analyses. The maps shown are the
projection on the cortical surface of the estimated optimum μ parameter. Different colors rep-
resent vertices (i.e., voxels projected onto the cortical surface) selective to different duration
ranges.
For the group-level analysis, the pRF maps for each participant were morphed into a com-
mon DARTEL template using the morph labels feature of the MNE software (https://mne-
tools.github.io/dev/index.html). MNE performs the morphing between subjects using the
spherical surfaces provided by Freesurfer. On the DARTEL surfaces, each vertex was assigned
the mode of the set of morphed individual data values corresponding to that vertex. This
method ensured that each vertex was represented by the most common duration across the
subjects.
Visualization.
For visualization of the group and of the single subject fMRI results in both
experiments, we inflated either the DARTEL template (group-level results) or the single-sub-
ject T1-weighted image (individual results) using the FreeSurfer pipeline (http://surfer.nmr.
mgh.harvard.edu/). To reconstruct surfaces for the DARTEL template, the gray matter and
white matter images of the template were combined into a single image with two distinct val-
ues assigned to the gray matter and white matter voxels. The combined images were treated as
a skullstripped T1-weighted image and submitted to the Freesurfer pipeline for surface
reconstruction.
Quantification of the spatial distribution of chronomaps
Surface-based approach.
In order to better appreciate the spatial distribution of the
chronomaps at the individual level, we identified chronomaps in each single subject by using
either the single-subject SPM t-maps (Exp 1) or the pRF maps (Exp 2). The surface-based anal-
yses were performed on images in the subject’s native space.
For a better visualization, these volumetric maps were projected onto the cortical surface of
each individual brain. Individual cortical surfaces were reconstructed following the Freesurfer
pipeline via segmentation of different brain tissues (projection fraction was set to 0.5).
Individual chronomaps were identified in left SMA and left IPS for Exp 1 and left and right
SMA and left and right IPS for Exp 2. In Exp 1, we used anatomical landmarks (i.e., identifica-
tion of the pre-, postcentral gyri and IPS) to make sure that chronomaps at single-subject level
matched the location of those observed at group level.
For Exp 2, the identification of the chronomap at single-subject level was easier since the
pRF analysis was performed on two distinct ROIs: BA 6 and IPS. For the identification of SMA
chronomap, we took only the medial part of the BA 6.
For each map, we created a surface ROI (left SMA and left IPS for Exp 1 and left, right SMA
and left, right IPS for Exp 2), and we manually drew its borders. According to the spatial pro-
gression of the maps (from short to long duration-selective voxels) observed at group level, we
identified an anterior and a posterior border for SMA maps and a medial and a lateral border
for IPS. Those borders were then used as cuts to flatten the surfaces and became the outer
edges of the flattened surfaces. For SMA, we took the postcentral gyrus as anatomical land-
mark for drawing the posterior border.

 For each duration-selective vertex and each ROI, we calculated the wRD from one of the
borders of the map (D1). This border, arbitrarily chosen, was the posterior for SMA map and
the lateral for the IPS map.
In more detail, the wRD from the D1 border was computed as the following: wRD ¼
PNvd
i¼1 w�RD
Nvd
, in which w is the weight of each vertex defined as the ratio between clustered dura-
tion-selective vertices (Nbrs) and the total number of vertices maximally responsive to a given
duration (Nvd), i.e., w = Nnbrs/Nvd. Whereas RD was the ratio between the distance from one
of the borders (D1) and the mean distance between the two borders (TD)RD = D1/TD.
For each map, we computed the wRD of each duration-selective cluster, and we identified a
slope of their spatial progression. The individual slopes were used to perform a Wilcoxon test
in order to check the statistical significance of the spatial progression of the maps.
Volume-based approach.
To make sure that the results from the surface-based analyses
depicted reality and were not the product of wrong projection of voxels onto the surface, we
also performed volume-based analyses.
Similar to surface-based analysis, here, we also identified for each experiment and each sub-
ject chronomaps in SMA and IPS.
Also, for volumetric maps, we defined maps’ borders. These were anterior and posterior for
SMA and medial and lateral for IPS.
In order to check whether the duration-selective voxels followed the same spatial pro-
gression as the surface maps, we identified for each subject and each map the “preferred
duration” of different portions of the map. More precisely, we binned the individual volu-
metric ROIs (in the subject’s native space) in parallel planes of 1.5-mm width. Within each
volumetric bin, the “preferred duration” was calculated as the duration the majority of acti-
vated voxels responded to. Thus, for each subject, we had a sequence of preferred durations
between the two borders of the map. We then decided to compute the average of preferred
durations across subjects. Since different subjects had sequences of preferred durations of
different length, we decided to proceed as follows: we calculated for each spatial bin its rela-
tive distance from one border (D1) of the map (i.e., posterior for SMA and lateral for IPS).
Then for each map, we created a single sequence of “preferred durations,” which included
the sequences of all subjects ordered according to their relative distance from D1. In order
to reduce the total length of this long sequence, we averaged every five values of the
sequence. The result of this procedure is displayed in panel C of Fig 3 and panel A of Figs 7
and 8.
In order to appreciate the spatial distribution of the maps at single-subject level, for each
subject and each duration-selective cluster of voxels, we also estimated the wCntrs. wCntrs
were estimated in individual maps normalized to a common Dartel space (Dartel-11 and
Dartel-10 for Exp.1 and Exp.2 respectively). Within a cluster of duration-selective voxels,
every voxel was assigned a weight based on the number of neighboring voxels with the
same duration selectivity. This means that clustered voxels had more weight than sparse
ones. The wCntrs were then calculated by taking into account the position of all duration-
selective voxels within a cluster, but each position was represented as many times as the
weight assigned to a specific voxel. This measure allowed us to visualize in a single graph
the central position of all duration-selective clusters in all subjects (see panel B of Figs 3, 7
and 8).
Tuning analysis
To check the response properties of duration-selective voxels, we looked at the BOLD response
to preferred and nonpreferred durations. In both experiments, for each subject and each

 cluster of duration-selective voxels within the different chronomaps (i.e., SMA and IPS in the
left hemisphere for Exp 1 and left and right SMA for Exp 2), we looked at the normalized
hemodynamic response to preferred and nonpreferred durations.
The normalization was performed as follows : BOLD t

xðtÞ� MBÞ=MB

Þ
in which t is the signal in a given voxel and MB is the baseline obtained averaging the signal of
t across runs. Normalization was then performed by subtracting the signal in a given voxel
from a baseline value and dividing it by the baseline. The BOLD response was aligned to the
second volume (i.e., a TR) after the offset of the S1 duration. Within a single subject, we first
averaged the BOLD signal across the voxels of a cluster and then across the fMRI runs.
Check for venous artifacts
In order to rule out the contribution of venous voxels to SMA chronomaps, we used two dis-
tinct methods for the two experiments. In Exp 1, we reasoned that any “venous” voxels in
SMA that contribute to the map should have very low signal intensity and a very high z score.
As you can see from S18 Fig (S4 Data), in which we show for each subject and each duration-
selective voxel the z scores (x-axis) plotted against the mean signal intensity across the 18 runs,
none of the voxels had a very high z score and a very low signal intensity.
In Exp 2, we reasoned that a “venous vertex” should not show any duration tuning, i.e., it
should be a vertex with a tuning function characterized by an abnormally wide spread (σ). In
S19 and S20 Figs (see S3 Data), we show for each subject, for the left and right SMA, in the
temporal and in the orientation task, the correlations between σ and μ. Again, none of the ver-
tices had a very wide spread; actually, all σ were <1. The reason to perform such correlation
was also to check the existence of a systematic relationship in the tuning function of mean and
spread for the different duration-selective vertices (e.g., small σ for small μ). Unfortunately, we
failed to find the existence of any relationship.

show the estimated μ on the cortical surface (medial part of BA6) of the estimated μ parameter.
Different colors represent vertices (i.e., voxels projected onto the cortical surface) selective to
different duration ranges (i.e., vertices with different estimated μ). The individual anterior (A)
and posterior (P) borders are shown with white vertical lines. In the plot the colored diamonds
represent the duration-selective vertices (x-axis) plotted according to their wRD from the pos-
terior border of the map. The white line in each plot is the result of a fitting procedure that
helps to identify the spatial progression of the maps. The data can be found in S4 Data. The
slope is calculated separately for durations below and above 1 second. fMRI, functional mag-
netic resonance imaging; PCG, precentral gyrus; SMA, supplementary motor area wRD,

S13 Fig. pRF group-level results of Exp 2. Here we show the estimated μ on the cortical sur-
face for the IPS of both hemisphere of the estimated μ parameter. Different colors represent
vertices (i.e., voxels projected onto the cortical surface) selective to different duration ranges
(i.e., vertices with different estimated μ). We show the results of the group (average of 10 sub-
jects) for the 17 estimated μ. The 17 μ are the 17 durations presented in the 10 different trial
type (either S1 or S2). The color scale goes from red, i.e., shortest duration (0.2 s) to dark blue,
i.e., longest duration (3 s). The white lines give an example of the map borders as they were
drawn to estimate the wRD in the individual subjects. On the left-hand side, time maps in time
task, on the right-hand side time maps in the orientation task. The data can be found in S4
