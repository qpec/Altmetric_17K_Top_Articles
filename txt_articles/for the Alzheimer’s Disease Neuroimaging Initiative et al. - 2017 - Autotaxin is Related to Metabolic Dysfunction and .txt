Abstract
Background—Obesity and insulin resistance are associated with neuropathology and cognitive 
decline in Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
Objective—Ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 2, also called autotaxin, is 
produced by beige adipose tissue, regulates metabolism, and is higher in AD prefrontal cortex 
(PFC). Autotaxin may be a novel biomarker of dysmetabolism and AD.
Methods—We studied Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants who were 
cognitively normal (CN; n=86) or had mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n=135) or AD (n=66). 
Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software. Multinomial regression analyses tested 
if higher autotaxin was associated with higher relative risk for MCI or AD diagnosis, compared to 
the CN group. Linear mixed model analyses were used to regress autotaxin against MRI, FDG-
PET, and cognitive outcomes. Spearman correlations were used to associate autotaxin and CSF 
biomarkers due to non-normality. FreeSurfer 4.3 derived mean cortical thickness in medial 
temporal lobe and prefrontal regions of interest.
Results—Autotaxin levels were significantly higher in MCI and AD. Each point increase in log-
based autotaxin corresponded to a 3.5 to 5 times higher likelihood of having MCI and AD, 
respectively. Higher autotaxin in AD predicted hypometabolism in the medial temporal lobe 
[R2=0.343, p<0.001] and PFC [R2=0.294, p<0.001], and worse performance on executive function 
and memory factors. Autotaxin was associated with less cortical thickness in PFC areas like

INTRODUCTION
Recent studies link obesity and metabolic dysfunction to decreased gray matter volume, less 
glucose metabolism, and other factors that contribute to Alzheimer’s disease (AD)[1–4]. 
Obesity may give rise to cerebral ischemia, which in turn is associated with brain tissue 
degeneration [5]. Additionally, obese individuals are more likely to have higher insulin 
resistance (IR), defined as the progressive inability for insulin to bind to its receptor [6]. IR 
is correlated with temporal and frontal amyloid deposition and brain atrophy in late middle-
aged participants at risk for AD [2, 7], as well as less glucose metabolism in cognitively 
normal (CN) elders [8] and AD participants [1]. Resulting oxidative stress may induce cell 
damage in the brain [9].
Numerous studies have also linked obesity with neuroinflammation and subsequent 
neurodegeneration, as induced by blood-brain barrier damage or microglial activation in the 
hippocampi of mice [9, 10]. Rats fed a high fat diet showed increased microglial activation 
as well as higher levels of the chaperone Hsp72, which are neuroprotective responses to 
brain injury [11]. Such high fat feeding also upregulates the expression of proinflammatory 
cytokines in the hypothalamus of rodents [12]. High levels of C-reactive protein, an 
inflammation marker, have been associated with increased white matter damage in 
individuals free of dementia [13]. Amylin oligomers and plaques were present in diabetic 
patients’ temporal lobe gray matter and absent in controls [14]. In a subsequent study, rats 
that overexpressed human amylin in the pancreas had elevated levels of brain pro-
inflammatory cytokines, as well as suppressed anti-inflammatory expression [15].
While it is increasingly clear that metabolic dysregulation may play a role in AD, there are 
currently no established biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that may reflect central 
metabolic dysfunction. CSF insulin may not be a reliable biomarker because individuals 
with type 2 diabetes show reduced insulin uptake in the brain, potentially due to reduced 
transport across the blood-brain barrier when an individual maintains constant high blood 
insulin levels [8]. Ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 2 (ENPP2), also 
known as autotaxin, is an enzyme derived from beige adipose that aids in glucose 
metabolism regulation and adipose tissue expansion [16] and has been shown to be elevated 
in the brains of AD subjects versus controls [17]. Autotaxin expression is an outcome of the 
accumulation of triglycerides in the adipocyte [18]. Autotaxin is mostly expressed in the 
human brain, placenta, ovary, and small intestine, and stimulates the formation of 
lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) [19].

 In the central nervous system, leptomeningeal cells in the pia mater, as well as astrocytes 
and oligodendrocytes, are hypothesized to secrete autotaxin [20]. LPA is a lipid-based 
growth factor and signaling molecule found in all mammalian cells, which promotes the 
generation of tissue fibrosis in vivo and in vitro, as well as neurotransmitter release and cell 
contraction and aggregation via utilization of G protein-coupled receptors [21, 22]. Rat 
neuronal cell culture work indicates that LPA administration leads to cortical folding and 
premature differentiation of cells [22]. Normal weight mice who were injected with LPA 
showed deficits in insulin response to glucose, and pancreatic beta-cells showed impaired 
insulin release when exposed to LPA [23]. Intriguingly, rats administered LPA showed 
increased blood-brain barrier permeability, suggesting that the effects of elevated autotaxin 
levels may be due to central and systemic factors [24]. EDG-2, an LPA receptor gene, is 
overexpressed in growing preadipocytes and may be an important regulator of adipose tissue 
development [25]. Obese women display positive correlations between serum autotaxin and 
fasting glucose [26]. Curiously, body mass index (BMI) and autotaxin showed no significant 
correlation in this cohort, indicating that autotaxin may be more of a product of IR, as 
opposed to the extent of obesity in an individual.
Importantly, some evidence suggests that autotaxin may play a role in AD, whereas the role 
of other metabolic biomarkers may be less clear. Individuals with AD-like dementia showed 
significantly higher gene expression of autotaxin in the frontal cortex, as compared to 
control brains [17]. Additional research is warranted to elucidate the association of high 
autotaxin levels with established AD biomarkers, cognitive function, and prefrontal cortex 
(PFC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL) brain volume and glucose metabolism in AD. PFC 
was a target area because our previous associations with IR are most consistent in that region 
[7, 8, 27–29], and that obesity across the lifespan is consistently associated with prefrontal 
atrophy [3]. Additionally, autotaxin in AD has only been examined in frontal cortices [17]. 
MTL is relevant to AD onset and progression, and we have shown that it is also sensitive to 
metabolic dysfunction.
In this study, data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were used 
to examine CSF autotaxin peptide levels among 287 individuals (75.06 ± 6.89 years of age) 
who were diagnosed as being CN or having late mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to 
AD or early AD. Autotaxin was regressed against cortical thickness (CT) and 
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) values in PFC and MTL, to examine if autotaxin was related to 
frontal and temporal atrophy and hypometabolism akin to our findings with IR [7, 8, 27, 28]. 
Relationships with neuropsychological function and traditional CSF biomarkers were also 
ascertained. The purpose of this study was to determine if CSF-derived autotaxin may be a 
biomarker for metabolic dysfunction in the brain and could be associated with AD 
neurological outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
Data from 287 adults aged 56 to 89 were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was 
launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. 
McLimans et al.

 Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical 
and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and 
early AD. For up-to-date information, see http://www.adni-info.org. Written informed 
consent was obtained from all ADNI participants at their respective ADNI sites. The ADNI 
protocol was approved by site-specific institutional review boards. Baseline mass 
spectrometry data for autotaxin was available for 86 CN, 135 MCI, and 66 AD participants. 
By month 24, MCI participants were classified as either remaining stable (MCI-S, n=80) or 
progressing to AD (MCI-P, n=55). CN subjects had MMSE scores between 24 and 30, a 
CDR score of 0, and no dementia. Participants were classified as MCI if they had an MMSE 
score between 24 and 30, a CDR score of 0.5, complaints of memory loss, and objective 
memory loss measured on the Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II. Probable AD 
was defined as MMSE scores between 20 and 26, a CDR score of 0.5 or 1.0, and meeting 
NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for probable AD. For additional information, see ADNI 
Procedures Manual (http://adni.loni.usc.edu). Details of the consensus procedure by the 
ADNI Conversion Committee are described elsewhere[1]. Other baseline data included 
demographics, structural MRI for PFC and MTL CT, neural glucose metabolism as 
determined by FDG uptake, APOE4 genotype, CSF and serum biomarkers, BMI, and 
neuropsychological performance. While amyloid imaging was also of interest, baseline 
scans were not analyzed due to small sample size (n=20).
Mass spectrometry and fasting glucose
Data were downloaded from the Biomarkers Consortium CSF Proteomics MRM dataset. As 
described previously[29], the ADNI Biomarkers Consortium Project investigated the extent 
to which selected peptides, measured with mass spectrometry (MS), could discriminate 
among disease states. Briefly, Multiple Reaction Monitoring-MS (MRM-MS) was used for 
targeted quantitation of 567 peptides representing 221 proteins in a single run (Caprion 
Proteome Inc., Montreal, QC, Canada). Analyte values of ENPP2 are in arbitrary signal 
units on a natural log scale. Fasting insulin was assayed using a plasma multiplex 
immunoassay panel (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/). Fasting glucose was derived from a standard 
laboratory test. Insulin and glucose were used to calculate the homeostatic model 
assessment, HOMA-IR [30]. Analyses for this report focused on the autotaxin peptide 
WWGGQPLWITATK. This peptide performed better in predicting glucose metabolism and 
cortical thickness than ENPP2 SYPEILTLK in preliminary stepwise regression analyses. To 
confirm that autotaxin reflected central dysmetabolism, established metabolic and 
inflammatory biomarkers in CSF were regressed against autotaxin, including insulin-like 
growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) peptides, pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2, 
neurosecretory protein VGF, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A, cholecystokinin and IL-6 
receptor [31, 32]. These were the only metabolic or metabolic-related indices available in the 
CSF for ADNI.
APOE genotype
The ADNI Biomarker Core at the University of Pennsylvania conducted APOE ε4 
genotyping. We characterized participants as being “non-APOE4” (i.e., zero APOE ε4 
alleles) or “APOE4” (i.e., one to two APOE ε4 alleles).

 Amyloid and tau CSF biomarkers
CSF sample collection, processing, and quality control of p-tau181, total tau, and Aβ1-42 are 
described in the ADNI1 protocol manual (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/) and Shaw et al. [33].
Clinical and cognitive assessments
Baseline global cognition and assessment scores included the Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE), clinical dementia rating-sum of boxes (CDR-sob), and AD 
assessment scale-cognitive subscale 11 (ADAS-cog11). The ADNI1 procedures manual 
describes diagnostic criteria (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/). The various tests that comprise 
executive function and memory factor are described elsewhere[34].
MRI
T1-weighted images, collected on 1.5T MR imaging units with a resolution of 1.25 × 1.25 × 
1.25 mm [35], were pre-processed using FreeSurfer 4.3 [36]. As described previously [2], 
this software corrects for motion, deskulls, bias corrects, segments, and parcellates gray and 
white matter into labeled cortical areas. We chose to examine CT instead of volume, as CT 
is typically considered a more sensitive index of gray matter pathology in participants who 
are at-risk [37] or have AD [38]. To contain type 1 error, we first explored one broad region 
of interest (ROI) in bilateral prefrontal cortex and one ROI in bilateral medial temporal lobe, 
followed by finer grained associations in sub-ROI if an initial omnibus analysis in a given 
broad ROI was significant. In the PFC, bilateral sub-ROIs included: 1) pars orbitalis; 2) pars 
triangularis; 3) caudal middle frontal; 4) rostral middle frontal; 5) superior frontal; 6) frontal 
pole; 7) lateral orbitofrontal; and 8) medial orbitofrontal. These areas are very similar to ROI 
chosen in previous reports on metabolic dysfunction with regional amyloid [2] and FDG [1]. 
In the MTL, bilateral sub-ROI included hippocampal volume (where CT is not calculated by 
FreeSurfer) and CT in: 1) medial temporal gyrus; 2) parahippocampal gyrus; and 3) 
entorhinal cortex. Bilateral pre-central gyrus was chosen as a control ROI, an area that 
shows little association with dysmetabolism and brain atrophy in middle-aged participants 
[7] or glucose metabolism in AD[1].
FDG-PET
Acquisition is described elsewhere [27, 39]. Images were resliced to a 1.5 mm3 voxel 
resolution in a 160 × 160 × 96 spatial matrix, intensity normalized to pons to derive the 
standardized uptake volume ratio (SUVR), smoothed using an 8mm Gaussian kernel, and 
normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute space. Due to the poorer native resolution of 
the FDG-PET images and smoothing to reduce noise, only the two broad ROI in PFC and 
medial temporal lobe were used. Similarly broad ROI have been used to examine 
relationships between dysmetabolism and FDG-PET [27].
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 23.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, 
NY). All analysis models except for cognition included the following covariates: age at 
baseline, sex, BMI, APOE ε4 genotype, and either baseline diagnosis or MCI conversion. 
The random effect of Subject was also covaried. For executive function, memory and global

 assessments, education was added as a covariate but not baseline diagnosis or MCI 
conversion, because cognitive assessments directly inform how participants are clinically 
classified. Linear mixed models, followed by least significant differences (LSD) post-hoc 
tests, were used to test if autotaxin levels differed by baseline diagnosis (CN, MCI, AD) or 
MCI conversion (MCI-S or MCI-P). Multinomial regression analyses tested if higher 
autotaxin was associated with higher relative risk ratios for an MCI or AD diagnosis, with 
CN as the reference group. Logistic regression was similarly used to assess increased risk of 
being MCI-P relative to MCI-S based on autotaxin.
Mixed model analyses were also performed to regress autotaxin against metabolic, MRI, 
FDG-PET, and cognitive outcomes. The main effect of autotaxin and its interaction with 
baseline diagnosis or MCI conversion were tested in a given model. Previous work has 
suggested that systemic IR is associated with neural outcomes like less regional FDG-PET 
in AD, but show different relationships in MCI-S or MCI-P depending on the brain region 
[27]. For the MRI analyses, to robustly contain type 1 error, an initial multivariate repeated 
measures omnibus was initially conducted for a broad PFC or medial temporal ROI, as 
described elsewhere [40], where each ROI was composed of several sub-ROI selected a 
priori based on our prior work [1, 2]. Briefly, this technique determines if there is an overall 
significant association with all sub-ROIs, allowing subsequent analyses to investigate each 
sub-ROI to determine where omnibus signal was derived without Bonferroni or similar 
corrections [41]. Even so, as a further type 1 error check described by Willette et al. [27], 
Holm-Bonferroni correction [42] was used to adjust the family-wise error rate to 0.05. 
Specifically, for a significant follow-up interaction for a given sub-ROI, autotaxin levels 
were regressed against CT for CN, MCI, and AD separately, or 3 null hypotheses per ROI. A 
p value of 0.017 was needed among one of the groups to achieve significance, followed by 
0.025 and 0.050.
Lastly, as described by the ADNI Biomarker Core [29], CSF and plasma analyte values were 
log-transformed to achieve normality. With the exception of AD biomarkers, all variables 
had homoscedastic variance and a normal distribution. Due to violations in regression 
diagnostics for p-tau181, total tau, and Aβ1-42 (see below), the non-parametric Spearman’s 
statistic was used to correlate autotaxin and CSF biomarker values.
RESULTS
Demographics and data summary
Summary information is listed in Table 1. All variables were normally distributed except for 
Aβ1-42 (D=0.130, p<0.001), Total tau (D=0.121, p<0.001), and p-tau (D=0.104, p<0.001), as 
fit against normal Q-Q plots was non-linear. Data transforms did not resolve non-normality. 
Non-parametric correlations were therefore conducted between autotaxin and CSF amyloid 
and tau biomarkers.
Baseline diagnosis: differences in autotaxin levels
Linear mixed models showed a main effect of baseline clinical diagnosis on autotaxin 
[F(2,286)=3.100, p=0.047]. There was a significant increase in log-scaled autotaxin from 
McLimans et al.

 CN to either MCI [Mean Difference±SE=0.078±0.036, p=0.029] or AD [Mean Difference
±SE=0.094±0.043, p=0.029], but not between MCI and AD [Mean Difference
±SE=0.016±0.038, p=0.665].
As a follow-up analysis, multinomial logistic regression was then used to examine if CSF 
autotaxin expression predicted an increased likelihood of being MCI or AD. The reference 
group was CN. The likelihood ratio statistic [χ2=5.990, p=0.050] indicated that higher 
autotaxin levels predicted a higher Odds Ratio for being MCI [β±SE=1.248±0.605, 
OR=3.485, 95% CI=1.065 to 11.397, Wald=4.264, p=0.039] or AD [β±SE=1.597±0.747, 
OR=4.940, 95% CI=1.134 to 21.351, Wald=4.574, p=0.032]. These results suggest that 
autotaxin levels were higher in memory impaired versus CN participants, and that per point 
increase in log-based autotaxin values corresponded to a roughly 3.5 to 5 times increase in 
the odds of having some degree of clinically relevant memory impairment. For MCI 
conversion by 24 months, there was no significant difference between MCI-S and MCI-P. 
Baseline autotaxin levels also did not predict likelihood of MCI conversion [χ2=0.177, 
p=0.674].
Associations of autotaxin with metabolic and inflammatory indices
Next, to validate autotaxin as an energy metabolism biomarker, CSF autotaxin levels were 
regressed against total body mass, peripheral and CSF metabolic and inflammatory 
biomarkers (Table 2), as well as used to predict likelihood of having pre-diabetes or type 2 
diabetes. We found that higher autotaxin was related to higher fasting glucose, several 
established biomarkers of metabolism in the CSF, CSF interleukin-6, and that higher levels 
per point increase reflected a 300% greater likelihood of having pre-diabetes or type 2 
diabetes.
ROI analysis: PFC and MTL CT
For bilateral PFC CT, a multivariate omnibus was conducted in one broad PFC ROI 
incorporating several sub-ROI from FreeSurfer areas, to minimize type 1 error [41]. The 
main effect of autotaxin and its interaction with baseline diagnosis were investigated. The 
interaction tested if autotaxin differentially predicted less CT among CN, MCI, or AD 
participants. There was a marginal, within-subject Regions × Baseline Diagnosis × 
Autotaxin interaction after Huynh-Feldt correction [F(14,1200)=1.784, p=0.066], which 
became significant after removing one outlier with a high autotaxin value (18.31) 
[F(14,1197)=2.031, p=0.032]. As indicated in Table 3, even after applying Holm-Bonferroni 
correction, higher autotaxin was associated with thinner CT in most PFC sub-ROI for AD 
participants, such as medial orbitofrontal cortex (Fig. 1A) and only in Pars Orbitalis for 
MCI, while the CN group showed negative and positive associations. By contrast, the 
omnibus for the one broad medial temporal ROI was non-significant, where further analyses 
were not pursued to guard against type 1 error. In the pre-central gyrus control region, there 
was no significant main effect of autotaxin or interaction with baseline diagnosis.
ROI analysis: PFC and MTL glucose metabolism
For FDG-PET, an Autotaxin * Baseline Diagnosis interaction [F(2,146)=3.106, p=0.048] 
showed that higher autotaxin predicted less glucose uptake in the broad PFC ROI for AD

 subjects [β±SE=−0.127±0.027, t(1,35)= −4.708, p<0.001], marginally for CN [β
±SE=-0.074±0.041, t(1,35)= −1.822, p=0.077] and not for MCI [β±SE=0.043±0.029, 
t(1,70)=1.497, p=0.139]. Removal of the same autotaxin outlier from the PFC CT analysis 
did not affect the association in the AD group [β±SE=−0.116±0.032, T(1,34)= −3.610, 
p=0.001] (Fig. 1B). In addition, the Autotaxin * MCI Conversion interactions were non-
significant for PFC.
Similar relationships were seen in the broad temporal ROI. A Baseline Diagnosis * 
Autotaxin interaction [F(2,146)=14.175 p<0.001] revealed that higher autotaxin was 
associated with less MTL glucose metabolism in AD [β±SE=−0.586±0.026, t(1,37)= −4.334 
p<0.001] and CN participants [β±SE=−0.429±0.049, t(1,35)= −2.773 p=0.009], but not in 
MCI [β±SE=0.189±0.027, t(1,72)=1.619 p=0.110].
FDG uptake in the pre-central gyrus control region did not show a main effect of autotaxin 
or interaction with baseline diagnosis or MCI conversion.
Cognition: global and executive function factor scores
As shown in Table 4, separate linear mixed models indicated that per point increase in 
autotaxin, scores were lower for the executive function and memory factors, but not for 
global cognition and function scores.
CSF biomarkers: Aβ1–42, total tau, and p-tau
Across all participants, the Spearman’s statistic showed that higher autotaxin was associated 
with higher levels of total tau, p-tau181, and total tau/Aβ1–42 (Table 5).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we hypothesized that CSF-derived autotaxin may be a biomarker for brain 
metabolic dysfunction relevant to AD. Strikingly, higher autotaxin predicted less bilateral 
PFC and MTL glucose uptake in individuals with AD, with similar effects seen in bilateral 
PFC CT. Results also showed that participants who had MCI or AD had significant 
increased log-scaled autotaxin. IR shows a similar relationship with PFC and MTL FDG-
PET in late middle-aged participants [28], and among aged CN adults with type 2 diabetes 
[8] or AD [27], where the ADNI AD group for the previous report and this cohort show 
similar results.
Higher autotaxin correlated with established metabolic biomarkers and higher risk for pre-
diabetes and type 2 diabetes. CSF ENPP2 was moderately associated with peripheral fasting 
glucose, but not BMI, where others have noted similar findings [26]. Furthermore, per point 
increase in autotaxin, executive function and memory factor scores were lower. Similarly, a 
decreased insulin sensitivity index in rhesus monkeys [43] was associated with less PFC 
gray matter and mediated worse motor-planning executive function performance. Higher 
HOMA-IR in aged humans with AD was also related to less MTL and PFC glucose 
metabolism [27], respectively mediating worse memory and executive function factor scores 
(unpublished data). Several studies have found similar associations between metabolic 
dysfunction, PFC outcomes, and executive function. Diabetes was significantly associated

 with worse cognitive performance and attention deficit in young adults without dementia 
[44]. In a cohort of bariatric surgery patients, as HOMA-IR levels decreased following the 
surgery, cognition scores improved [45]. Taken together, autotaxin shows a pattern of 
relationships with established metabolism biomarkers, MTL and PFC-specific outcomes, 
and related cognitive dysfunction that may reflect central dysmetabolism and is similar to 
our previous findings with IR.
Autotaxin was also positively correlated with levels of total tau, p-tau181, total tau/Aβ1–42, 
as well as p-tau181/Aβ1–42 to a marginal degree. This pattern suggests that CSF autotaxin 
predicts AD neuropathology in a manner similar to dysmetabolism. Chronic application of 
insulin in vitro in human cortical stem cells appeared to induce insulin resistance and inhibit 
tau dephosphorylation [46]. Higher IR among cognitively normal, APOE4 late middle-aged 
participants also predicted higher total tau and phosphorylated tau [47], but not CSF 
amyloid. Amyloidosis is scant in this late middle-aged cohort, but does show modest 
regional associations with higher IR [2]. ADNI did not have enough baseline amyloid scans 
(n=20) to warrant analysis with autotaxin.
This brings to question the underlying mechanism behind the correlation of autotaxin and 
AD-related outcomes. Individuals with high autotaxin may be more likely to be obese, 
causing an increase in IR, ischemia, and oxidative stress. Results of our study showed a 
weak association between systemic glucose and CSF autotaxin. As an alternative or 
interrelated mechanism, autotaxin stimulates the release of LPA, which may be detrimental 
[21, 22]. LPA has been shown to prompt neurite withdrawal and tau phosphorylation in 
neuroblastoma cells [48]. Addition of LPA to neuroblastoma cells led to increased 
immunoreactivity with antibodies that react with tau phosphorylation [17].
There are several study limitations to address. Regression diagnostic issues were 
encountered for total tau, p-tau181, and Aβ1–42, requiring non-parametric analyses. 
Autotaxin levels did not differ in MCI conversion or contribute to MCI conversion risk, nor 
were there significant interactions with MCI conversion, which may be due to small sample 
size. Instead, baseline values were widely dispersed in the MCI converter group. This 
mirrors IR MCI interactions [1]. No associations were found with Aβ levels, but there were 
significant associations with tau and p-tau181, as well as tau to amyloid ratios. Given that the 
mass spectrometry panel was only available at baseline, we were unable to longitudinally 
assess autotaxin levels and various outcomes. While longitudinal predictions would be 
useful, it was beyond the scope of this report, which was to systematically assess if autotaxin 
may be a relevant AD biomarker. While autotaxin was associated with fasting glucose, it 
was surprising that it was not associated with systemic insulin or HOMA-IR. This may be 
because insulin was derived from a plasma multiplex, and the values are lower than ELISA. 
Nonetheless, autotaxin was associated with fasting glucose, risk for pre-diabetes and type 2 
diabetes, and was associated with many established metabolic factors in CSF. It also shows a 
pattern of results comparable to HOMA-IR and either brain atrophy or FDG-PET[7, 27, 28]. 
The non-significance of MTL ROI CT was unexpected; however, it also provides direction 
for future research. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) may be a potential element in this 
phenomenon. GLP-1 stimulates the release of insulin as well as downregulates the release of 
glucagon and breakdown of amyloid-β protein precursor [49]. GLP-1 receptor production in

 the aged mouse medial PFC was decreased compared to young mice, but no similar 
relationship was seen in the hippocampal regions [49].
In summary, this study demonstrates that CSF-derived autotaxin in elders correlated with 
greater odds for having MCI or AD, hyperglycemia, AD neuropathology related to total tau, 
p-tau181, and the total tau/Aβ1–42 ratio, less gray matter CT in PFC, hypometabolism in PFC 
and MTL, and worse executive function and memory scores. These results support the 
theory that autotaxin may be an indicator of central dysmetabolism for a variety of AD 
outcomes. Further replication is necessary to determine if autotaxin predicts AD and tracks 
certain aspects of the disease. Future clinical and animal model work should consider 
examining this biomarker and its applications as a potential target for pharmacologic 
therapies in the setting of glucose dysregulation and AD. Such work should also examine 
how autotaxin predicts changes in these outcomes over time.
