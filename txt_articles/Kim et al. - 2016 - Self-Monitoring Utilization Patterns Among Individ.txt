Abstract
Background: The advent of digital technology has enabled individuals to track meaningful biometric data about themselves.
This novel capability has spurred nontraditional health care organizations to develop systems that aid users in managing their
health. One of the most prolific systems is Walgreens Balance Rewards for healthy choices (BRhc) program, an incentivized,
Web-based self-monitoring program.
Objective: This study was performed to evaluate health data self-tracking characteristics of individuals enrolled in the Walgreens’
BRhc program, including the impact of manual versus automatic data entries through a supported device or apps.
Methods: We obtained activity tracking data from a total of 455,341 BRhc users during 2014. Upon identifying users with
sufficient follow-up data, we explored temporal trends in user participation.
Results: Thirty-four percent of users quit participating after a single entry of an activity. Among users who tracked at least two
activities on different dates, the median length of participating was 8 weeks, with an average of 5.8 activities entered per week.
Furthermore, users who participated for at least twenty weeks (28.3% of users; 33,078/116,621) consistently entered 8 to 9
activities per week. The majority of users (77%; 243,774/315,744) recorded activities through manual data entry alone. However,
individuals who entered activities automatically through supported devices or apps participated roughly four times longer than
their manual activity-entering counterparts (average 20 and 5 weeks, respectively; P<.001).
Conclusions: This study provides insights into the utilization patterns of individuals participating in an incentivized, Web-based
self-monitoring program. Our results suggest automated health tracking could significantly improve long-term health engagement.

 Introduction
The majority of Americans (69%) regularly track at least one
indicator of health, including their weight, diet, exercise routine,
or symptoms related to chronic disease, with a growing minority
(21%) taking advantage of mobile health (mHealth) devices to
help them [1]. With an increasing repertoire of mHealth devices,
there is a growing trend among many individuals to measure,
track, change health behavior, and make health decisions based
on quantifiable data collected on oneself. Projections show that
the number of everyday wearables, devices, and sensors will
increase 5-fold by 2019 [2].
Though the effectiveness of self-monitoring using mHealth
technology has been highly variable across studies [3], it is well
established that effective self-monitoring can have profound
health benefits. For example, among diabetics, blood glucose
monitoring is a major component of disease management and
provides individuals the ability to assess glycemic targets and
evaluate response to therapy [4-6]. Additionally, blood pressure
monitoring has been associated with improved short-term blood
pressure control and medication adherence [7,8], and
self-monitoring has also been shown to improve weight loss
and short-term activity levels [9,10]. Importantly, monitoring
programs, wearable devices, and other nontraditional health
care resources can potentially facilitate healthy behavior changes
[11].
As nontraditional health care channels such as retail clinics and
virtual care are becoming increasingly popular and beneficial,
the traditional health care system is beginning to shift from
episode-based fee-for-service to value-based reimbursements
[12]. Together, these factors have led to an interest in integrating
novel self-monitoring systems into wellness programs, chronic
condition management, and the diagnosis of acute episodes.
This makes understanding health self-monitoring in these
systems an important first step in incorporating these
technologies into routine patient care.
In September 2012, Walgreens, one of the largest drugstore
chains in the United States, launched its Web-based Balance
Rewards for healthy choices (BRhc) program (details in
Methods). Members enrolled in the program may track activities
and biometric measures to earn points which may be redeemed
for purchases at Walgreens. The BRhc Web-based portal and
mobile app allows users to set goals and track activities over
time. Members can track exercise (including walking, running,
and cycling), body weight, and sleep. In April 2014, the program
expanded to offer members reward points for connecting
biometric devices and inputting blood glucose and blood
pressure readings. As a large, nationwide, novel health
self-monitoring system, the BRhc offers a unique opportunity
to evaluate utilization patterns of individuals enrolled in this
incentivized program.
The aim of this study is to evaluate characteristics and
activity-tracking patterns for individuals enrolled in the
Walgreens BRhc program. Our specific objectives are to (1)
present overall participation trends, (2) examine participation
across different activities, and (3) explore how automatic activity
tracking contributes to utilization patterns.
Methods
Program Description
The Walgreens’ BRhc program Web-based user portal can be
accessed on its website and via a mobile app as depicted in
Figure 1. This program allows members to set goals and track
health activities over time. One of the main features of the
program is the use of incentives to motivate voluntary
participation. Through participation, members receive points
that can be redeemed for discounts on purchases.

Earning Points in BRhc Program
Members receive points through engaging in a range of
activities, including setting initial health goals (250 points),
quitting smoking (250 points), filling prescriptions (100 points),
and receiving immunizations (100 points). Members also receive
points for logging health activities: 20 points per mile walked,
ran, or cycled (maximum 1000 points per month); 20 points per
day for logging body weight; 20 points per blood glucose test
(maximum 40 points per day), and 20 points for logging blood
pressure per day.
Devices or Apps Linked With BRhc Program
Members have the option of logging these activities manually
on the Web-based portal or app, or linking a supported mHealth
device or app to their BRhc account for automated data upload
(linking a supported technology rewards 250 points). Available
apps and devices are presented on Walgreens website, where
22 apps cover fitness trackers, weight loss, medication
reminders, blood pressure monitors, blood glucose monitors,
or telemedicine, and of the 36 devices, some include fitness and
sleep trackers, blood pressure monitors, blood glucose monitors,
or pulse oximeter [13].
Redemption of Points in Balance Rewards Program
Walgreens Balance Rewards is a loyalty program offered by
the Walgreen Company to its customers through earning Balance
Rewards points on certain purchases or behaviors through the
BRhc program. Integrated Balance Rewards points can be
redeemed on most purchases at participating Duane Reade or
Walgreens Pharmacy locations. Earned points are converted
into redemption dollars at the following tiers: 1000 points = US
$1, 2000 points = US $2, 3000 points = US $3, 5000 points =
US $5, 10,000 points = US $10, 18,000 points = US $20, 30,000
points = US $35, and 40,000 points = US $ 50. The minimum
redeemable is 5000 points for a US $5 reward on a single
purchase, and the maximum redeemable per purchase is 40,000
points for US $50. Points expire 3 years after they are earned
or if an account has been inactive for 6 months.
Study Data
Walgreens BRhc utilization data for the entirety of 2014
(January 1 to December 31) was available for this study. This
includes data on 7 activity-tracking categories: exercise, weight,
sleep, blood pressure, blood glucose, tobacco use, and oxygen
saturation. For the purposes of this study, we omitted tobacco
use and oxygen saturation as they are less common self-tracking
activities [1]. All activity records were either entered manually
by users via the Web-based portal, or uploaded automatically
using a supported device or app. For each activity recorded, the
date and mode of entry (ie, manual or automatic) was available.
In total, prior to exclusions, this included 30,420,457 activities
recorded from 455,341 unique users. We also collected the age
and gender of the users when available.
Exclusion criteria were (1) activities recorded with duplicate
values entered on the same day by the same person (2,309,327
activities), (2) users with unknown age or less than 18 years old

 (n=13,932), (3) users with accounts created before or after 2014
(n=105,849), (4) users who logged their first activity more than
30 days after enrolling in the program (n=3,762), (5) users whose
first recorded activity occurred after December 1, 2014 (ie, less
than 1 month of follow-up, n=15,700), and (6) tobacco use and
oxygen saturation activities (133,101 activities). This resulted
in a study population of 315,744 unique users and 12,805,893
activities recorded.
We also focused on 2 subsets of users: (1) returning users who
recorded an activity on 2 or more different dates (209,253 users,
12,661,261 activities recorded), and (2) users who had at least
twenty weeks of potential follow-up (ie, first activity occurred
before August 2014; 116,621 users, 10,946,634 activities
recorded). A study flowchart is presented in Figure 2. Finally,
we differentiated users according to their primary mode of
activity entry (ie, manual or automatic).
Figure 2. Flowchart of study participants.
Ethical Consideration
Data used in this study comprised gender, age, activity type,
date of activity entered either manually or automatically, and
amount of activities. These were deidentified datasets and this
study was carried out with approval of waiver of informed
consent from the Quorum Review Independent Review Board
(Review file # 30291/1) for the following reasons: The research
involved no more than minimal risk to subjects, the waiver
would not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects,
and the research could not be carried out without the waiver.
Utilization Metrics
To assess utilization patterns within the BRhc program, we
examined metrics related to the duration users participated in
the program and the frequency of activities recorded. We
identified the participation length for each user; that is the time
between the first and last activity recorded. We also noted gaps
between consecutive activities recorded—specifically those

 exceeding 1 month and 3 months—and defined the length of
active participation as the number of weeks users recorded at
least one activity. We also computed the frequency of activities
recorded for each user over each week of participation, including
the type of activity entered (e.g. exercise) and the mode of entry.
In addition to presenting the results across and within each type
of activity, we also focused on users tracking blood pressure
and blood glucose (n=19,143) as they were likely to have
hypertension, or diabetes, or be at high risk for these diseases.
Statistical Analysis
Results are presented as counts, mean (SD), and median
(interquartile range) as appropriate. Of the users who recorded
an activity on at least two different dates and had at least five
months of follow-up, we identified users who recorded activities
solely via manual entry and those users who used a supported
device or app to upload activities. We compared participation
lengths between these groups using t-test and Kaplan-Meier
analysis. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS
Institute Inc) and figures were created using the ggplot2 library
in R version 2.15.2 [14]. All statistical tests were evaluated at
a 2-sided significance level of 0.05.
Results
Findings
In 2014, 455,341 unique users participated in the Walgreens’
BRhc program. These users either entered manually or linked
a supported device or app that automatically entered 1 of 7
activities tracked in the BRhc program: exercise, weight, sleep,
blood pressure, blood glucose data recorded, tobacco use, and
oxygen saturation. In total, 30,420,457 activities were entered
between January 1 and December 31 (average 66.81 per user).
Of the 455,341 users, 315,744 (69.34%) were new users who
had at least one month of follow-up activity data. The mean age
was 38.65 years (SD 10.95), median was 38.91 (interquartile
range [IQR] 31.53 to 42.88) and of the 65.66%
(207,330/315,744) of users with nonmissing gender information,
81.71% (169,402/207,330) were women.
Basic demographics and usage characteristics of these 315,744
new members are presented in Table 1.
A large proportion of users (33.73%; 106,491/315,744) who
created an account logged in just for a day during the study
period. Of the remaining 66.27% of users entering activities for
more than 2 days, 77.62% (162,426/209,253) logged activities
a month or more after their first entry.
The majority of users (57.00%) of the total study population
tracked only 1 type of activity, with exercise being the most
common metric tracked (85.52%). However, a sizable number
of individuals (21.34%) tracked 3 or more activities – the most
common combination being exercise, weight, and sleep. Finally,
most users (77.21%) manually logged their activities exclusively
through the BRhc Web-based portal, whereas 14.65% of users
only logged activities automatically through a supported device
or app (8.14% used both means).
Returning Users
Of the 315,744 new members who enrolled in the BRhc program
during the study period, 66.27% (209,253/315,744) of users
logged activities on multiple occasions. Usage features of these
returning users participating in the program are presented in
Table 2.

The median length of participation for these users was 8 weeks
(IQR 4-18). There was a tendency among users who logged
exercise and sleep activities to participate in the program the
longest (median 8 and 10 weeks, respectively), whereas users
who logged blood pressure and blood glucose had the shortest
participation duration (median 6 weeks; all P<.001). A
proportion (23.72%) of users had a moderate (at least one
month) gap between consecutive logged entries over their
participation period, and a small number of users (5.44%) had
a substantial gap (at least three months) between entries. Overall,
half of the returning users participated for at least eight weeks,
but periods of inactivity were not uncommon.
Meanwhile, returning users logged 5.66 activities per week (SD
7.73) when all different types of activities were included, but
median value of logged activities was 2.87 (IQR 0.52-7.67),
indicating a small percentage of highly-active users contributed
to the increase in the mean frequency. Among specific activities,
blood glucose had the highest weekly entry (mean 5.57 entries
per week) and body weight had the least (mean 2.84 entries).
Finally, we note that a higher proportion of these returning users
used a supported device or app compared to all new users
(33.22% vs 22.79%, respectively). The most commonly used
device was Fitbit (59.89% of returning users with supported
device or app; 41,608/69,472), followed by Jawbone (2.39%;
1666/69,472) and Misfit (1.60%; 1112/69,472), which are
activity trackers, wireless-enabled wearable technology devices
that measure data such as steps walked, heart rate, or sleep time.
The commonly used apps were Runkeeper (20.03%;
13,917/69,472), Lose It! (10.75%; 7472/69,472), MyFitnessPal
(7.29%; 5062/69,472) and MapMyFitness (6.41%; 4456/69,472),
which also tracked caloric intake, calories burned, and weight.
Furthermore, the vast majority (96.57%; 69,506/71,970) of new
users who linked a device or app returned to logged activities
on subsequent days. However, in part due to the availability of
supported tools only for specific activities, we observed vast
variability across activities. There is potential that this variability
in linked device or app use accounts for the utilization
differences between activities observed above. We further
examine this hypothesis in more detail in the following sections.
Long-Term Utilization
To explore long-term usage, we identified a subset of members
(116,621 users with 10,946,634 recorded activities) who joined
the program before August 2014 and who had 2 or more log-on
dates. This allowed us to examine utilization over the first 20
weeks after program enrollment. Of these users, 31.20%
(36,390/116,621) stopped participating after 1 week, and 49.88%
(58,177/116,621) stopped within 1 month. However, after this
initial dropout, the number of users in the program remains
fairly consistent over many weeks (Figure 3).
After 20 weeks, 28.36% (33,078/116,621) of registered users
were still actively engaged in the program. Meanwhile,
combined with the duration of program participation, the
frequency of program participation over the first 20 weeks
demonstrated some interesting trends. First, the average number
of activities logged by users was 4.28 during the first week in
the program. However, after excluding the roughly one-third
of users who ceased recording activities after 1 week, the
average number of activities logged by participating users
increased to 7.53 by the second week. After 4 weeks, this
number was 8.01 and remained relatively steady throughout the
20-week period examined (Figure 3).
Overall, this demonstrates that while a large proportion of users
stopped participating in the BRhc program early on (roughly
half by 4 weeks), those that did continue to log activities did so
at a fairly consistent level throughout their participation period.
We observed that users log activities roughly three days a week,
on average, the most common activity being exercise.

The Role of Supported Devices and Apps That
Automatically Log Activities
Around one-third of returning users and 23% of all users used
a supported device or app which, when linked to the account,
was able to record and automatically upload activities directly
to the BRhc portal. There was also marked variability in the
proportion of users who used such tools across different
activities. For example, 35.74% of users (66,489/186,037)
logging exercise activities used an automatically uploading
device or app while 52.26% (32,424/62,040) of users logging
sleep did too.
Among users who joined the program before August 2014,
automatic activity logging was strongly associated with longer
participation length (Figure 4).
Users logging activities automatically using a linked device or
app participated on average (mean) 24.01 weeks versus 10.54
weeks among those logging activities manually (P<.001).
Furthermore, users automatically logging activities were active
participants (number of weeks recording at least one activity)
for 20.15 weeks on average compared with 5.23 weeks (P<.001).
This trend was consistent across all the tracking activities where
automatic upload was common: exercise (20.41 weeks vs 5.71),
sleep (13.61 vs 3.25), and weight (10.76 vs 5.18; all P<.001)
but not for blood pressure (6.26 vs 6.18; P=.88) or blood glucose
(8.37 vs 6.71; P=.11) where automatic tracking was rare (Table
3).
Although most of the users were female, male participants were
more likely to be the active users in this program, especially in
weight tracking (mean active weeks of male vs female in
manual, 6.09 vs 5.02; P<.001, values in automatic upload, 14.44
vs 9.52; P<.001).

aVariable with significant difference between female and male.
Although the majority of all users (77.21%; 243,774/315,744)
exclusively logged activities manually through the BRhc
Web-based portal, interestingly, automatically-entered data
accounted for the majority of all recorded activities. Of the
nearly 13 million total activities recorded by returning users,
only 23.46% (2,969,761/12,661,261) were manually entered,
while the remaining 76.54% (9,691,500/12,661,261) were
entered automatically using a linked device or app. Again, we
observed that sleep (92.02%; 2,430,157/2,640,769) and exercise
(83.00%; 6,966,901/8,393,429) had the highest frequency of
activities logged automatically while weight, blood pressure,
and blood glucose were lowest (all P<.001) among users
enrolled prior to August 2014.

Users Tracking Blood Pressure and Blood Glucose
BRhc members logging blood pressure and blood glucose
recordings may represent a slightly different population than
the other BRhc members as they would be more likely to have
hypertension, diabetes, be at increased risk, or have the
perception to be at risk for these conditions. Furthermore,
automated data upload to the BRhc platform using a device or
app was rarely used for tracking blood pressure or blood glucose
in 2014. However, these users could benefit from the program,
as monitoring of blood pressure and blood glucose is critical to
the control of hypertension and diabetes.
A total of 19,143 returning users in the BRhc logged blood
pressure or blood glucose measurements. Similar to the entire
BRhc member population, their average age was 41.62 (SD
13.61) years and 80.25% (14,290/17,806) were female. On
average, users logging blood pressure or blood glucose activities
tracked a wider range of activities than other users (median 4
vs 2). Most of these users also tracked weight (92.73%;
17,751/19,143), exercise (91.36%; 17,489/19,143), or sleep
(86.34%; 16,529/19,143). There were 12,401 new users tracking
blood pressure or blood glucose that enrolled in the BRhc
program prior to August 2014. Similar to the entire population,
27.02% (3351/12,401) of these users quit logging activities by
the first week and 21.84% (2709/12,401) were still recording
activities after 20 weeks.
Discussion
Principal Findings
Monitoring of physiologic parameters, health activities, and
health behaviors outside of the medical setting has the potential
to enable alternative systems of health management that can be
both more individualized and convenient for health consumers.
An understanding of the patterns of home-based self-tracking
can provide insights into optimizing such programs in future
health care models.
The Walgreens’ BRhc program is one such alternative health
management system that, in 2014, enrolled 455,341 members.
Walgreens incentivizes users to log health-related activities that
can be tracked using the BRhc portal. Recently, a study was
performed to increase physical activities using wearable devices
and gamification from incentivized consumers [15]. This study
analyzed the descriptive data from GOODcoins, a self-guided,
consumer engagement and rewards platform incentivizing
physical activities. The results suggested that challenges and
incentives might work for connected and active participants in
achieving healthy physical activities. Our study showed
consistent, extended results to the previous finding of how
incentivized consumers track health behaviors and health data
in real-world setting with large population.
In this study we examined the utilization characteristics of these
individuals.
First, BRhc users who provided their gender information were
mostly women (81.7%; 169,402/207,330) in their thirties

 (median age 38.9 with IQR 31.5 to 42.9). This finding is
consistent with previous studies of Web-based weight loss
programs [16,17]. A recent survey from the National Cancer
Institute found that being younger and female were associated
with increased use of Web-based and other nontraditional health
resources [18]. Considering the size of participants and impact
of availability of Walgreens drug stores, this phenomenon could
be representative of real-world setting, not artificially chosen
nor controlled population.
We note that BRhc members were self-selected without any
mediation of, for example, health care professionals. Thus,
strategies to better engage men [19] and the elderly [20] need
to be more fully explored in order for home-based health
management to become a more common occurrence in everyday
lives across all demographics. Also, in our analysis of a
long-term observation group showed that men, although being
a small portion of the total users, who voluntarily selected the
program tended to be more active users in tracking health
behaviors than women. This trend seemed prominent in weight
tracking where intentional efforts are needed more than any
other activity, even when linked with apps or devices. So
engagement methods need to be studied differently according
to gender.
We presented frequency and duration utilization metrics of the
BRhc program. Approximately one-third of users created an
account, logged a single activity, and then never returned. These
users reflect an audience with initial interest, but are either
immediately turned off or fail to see (or care for) any benefit of
continuing to log activities in the program. This result follows
a trend seen in other studies, for example: one study of a weight
loss app found that it was downloaded by nearly 190,000 users
but only 2.6% used the app for at least one week [21]; and
another showed high attrition rate and rapid decrease in usage
in mobile and Internet programs for maintaining physical activity
after cardiac rehabilitation [22]. Especially in the era of
consumer-centric mobile or Web-based intervention studies,
phenomenon of dropout attrition and nonusage attrition where
substantial proportion of users not using the intervention as
guided or dropping out before completion, the so called “law
of attrition” [23] still remains the challenging issue. Our attrition
curve also suggested early “curiosity plateau,” followed by a
more steady group of users who remained in the program. In
this regard, we believe that identification and understanding of
the characteristics of these individuals, and factors that promote
interest or motivate behavior change is critically important in
this rapidly evolving field.
Factors Associated With Adherence in Healthy
Behavior Program
According to a review regarding Web-based recruitment
methods for mobile health study, virtual aspect of intervention
might lead to comfort in enrolling the trial, less investment in
ongoing usage, and possibility of fraudulent enrolling in the
trial [24]. Other proposed factors that can influence patient
retention and engagements are usability of the program,
interactive feedback, tangible and intangible observable
advantage in using the program, effort and time required,
networking effects or peer pressure, and user factors
(demographic education, previous experiences) [23]. To increase
a consumer’s motivation and active participation, various
incentive-driven mobile health technologies such as education,
reminder, feedback, social, financial, or gamification can be
simultaneously used and provide its efficacy [25].
In order to test or implement a mobile health program with
actively-engaged users, attrition must be actively reported in
metrics such as usage half-life, dropout attrition curve, or
Kaplan-Meier analysis [23] and analyzed according to user
factors (sociodemographic, health condition etc), usability, and
components of the program itself for solving the attrition
problem.
Also for the behavior change, it is not clear whether a previous
active tracker is viewed as a superuser in the BRhc program or
a person who does not participate in health behavior tracking
has become an active tracker initiated by the program. Further
exploration around behavior changes is needed to clarify the
impact of behavior changes on users at different stages.
Michie et al developed and refined the behavioral change
technique taxonomy for behavioral change intervention [26],
and this system can be effectively adopted for implementing
and evaluating a mobile health intervention program. In the
BRhc program, incentives such as rewards points, goal setting,
and self-monitoring of behavior were used as behavior change
techniques motivated by Fogg’s behavioral change methods
[27,28]. This program definitely proved its positive impact on
pervasiveness recognized by 800,000 users, 250,000 connected
devices, and 73 miles logged as of April 2015 [29], but further
issues with continuous engagement or participation of various
ages with gender seemed to be solved.
Long-Term Adherence to Healthy Behavior Program
and Automated Self-Monitoring Tool
Our results of long-term utilization demonstrated that roughly
one-third of returning users quit within 1 week, half quit within
a month, and two-thirds quit by 5 months. However, the attrition
rate declined rapidly after this, particularly so in users logging
activities using a linked device or app. Over half (57%) of all
users that were still participating after 1 month continued to
participate for at least twenty weeks. Since motivating behavior
change to improve health management requires continuous and
often complex processes, engaging consumers both initially and
for prolonged lengths of time will be important components of
success. There is still much to learn about motivating long-term
participation, but at a minimum, tools should be simple enough
for users and incorporate proven behavior change theories
through the use of rewards or incentives [30].
One such tool to improve long-term health self-monitoring is
mobile and wireless health-tracking technologies. These
technologies can collect, transmit, and aggregate health data –
automated, thus removing this burden from the user. We
discovered that users tracking data using devices participated
in the program, on average, 24 weeks compared with 11 weeks
among users not using any device. Furthermore, these users
were active 20 weeks on average compared with 5 weeks.
Another study looking for adherence to the protocol through
mobile phone apps which compared website or paper diaries

 for weight loss also proved the advantage of mobile phone apps
even when it was not a fully automated process [31].
More advanced and user-friendly self-monitoring tools are
continually being developed, and their capacity to interact with
and be interpreted within traditional (eg, electronic health
records) and nontraditional health care systems will be critical
in their implementation. It is becoming a common feature of
many new mobile health devices to enable automated collection,
downloading, and sharing of measured biometrics. Yet, while
our study showcased the benefit of automated systems, we feel
the next frontier in this field needs to address the interpretation
of data collected from these devices beyond displaying the data
to users in attractive pictures [32]. Many studies have shown
the benefit of remote monitoring in improving outcomes with
patients not only in chronic condition such as chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, heart failure, diabetes, or hypertension
[33,34] but also meaningful interpretation of data at the point
of need can be valuable in acute infectious disease such as Ebola
outbreak [35].
Individuals With Chronic Condition and Automated
Self-Monitoring Tool
Individuals with chronic conditions could potentially benefit
most from automated tracking tools. Health complications from
hypertension and diabetes, for example, are largely preventable
with proper management. However, these conditions (and
others) are often poorly controlled. In a number of cases,
automated interventions have shown health benefits: a prior
study showed that a fully automated behavioral intervention
leveraging Web, mobile, and automated mobile phone calls
significantly improved glycemic control, body weight, and
diabetes risk among prediabetics [36]; another showed that a
physical activity intervention consisting of automated weekly
exercise scheduling reminders, a message board to share their
experience with others, and feedback on their level of physical
activity increased and maintained levels of physical activity in
healthy adults [37]; and another showed that a fully automated
smoking cessation program using email, Web, interactive voice
response, and short messaging service was associated with
abstinence rates without the use of nicotine replacement therapy
[38]. However, even with access to the latest technologies to
monitor any biometric or condition, engagement, which leads
to behavior change, is key. Technology in and of itself is
unlikely to drive change toward positive health outcomes.
Additional factors, like incentives used in the BRhc program
and how they interact with technologies to engage participants
have shown positive health behavior changes [39] and potential
to drive the future of health self-monitoring.
Limitations
This study focused on characteristics of users of an incentivized,
Web-based self-monitoring program. Although users of the
BRhc program can be representative of real-world setting, when
we look at long-term utilization, the composition of
users—self-selected, young, and most likely female—as well
as high attrition rate affect the validity and generalizability of
our findings. Further exploration of the relationship between
utilization patterns and their impact on perceived value,
especially among users tracking blood pressure or blood glucose,
are needed to better understand the potential impact on behavior
change and chronic conditions management.
Since this program used incentive for behavior change and
engagement, relationship between Balance Reward points and
usage activities should have been investigated. Balance Rewards
points are calculated both from purchasing certain products and
earning behavioral points from the BRhc program to be used
as redemption. However, since the variables of total reward
points or redemption contents were not available in our database,
and hypothetical BRhc program can be calculated from usage
activities itself, it was difficult to prove the role of “incentive”
leading to behavior changes. Also incentive itself was relatively
small. If a first-time user creates an account, sets up a goal, and
logs in 9 different activities for 1 month, not skipping even one,
he or she will get maximum 6050 points, which can be redeemed
at 6 dollars a month.
Conclusions
Web-based and mobile health self-monitoring is popular in the
general population, and could play a critical role in the future
of health management and wellness. Self-monitoring has been
shown to improve health and management of chronic conditions.
However, there are considerable challenges in initiating and
sustaining engagement for long periods of time. This study
provides insights into utilization patterns of incentivized users
participating in a large, nationwide, Web-based self-monitoring
program and supports the benefit of automated health tracking
to help maintain long-term engagement.
