The pandemic of hospital-acquired infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has declined,
but the evolution of strains with enhanced virulence and toxins and the increase of community-associated infections are
still a threat. In previous studies, 107 MRSA bacteria applied as simulated droplet contamination were killed on copper and
brass surfaces within 90 min. However, contamination of surfaces is often via finger tips and dries rapidly, and it may be
overlooked by cleaning regimes (unlike visible droplets). In this new study, a 5-log reduction of a hardy epidemic strain of
MRSA (epidemic methicillin-resistant S. aureus 16 [EMRSA-16]) was observed following 10 min of contact with copper,
and a 4-log reduction was observed on copper nickel and cartridge brass alloys in 15 min. A methicillin-sensitive S. aureus
(MSSA) strain from an osteomyelitis patient was killed on copper surfaces in 15 min, and 4-log and 3-log reductions oc-
curred within 20 min of contact with copper nickel and cartridge brass, respectively. Bacterial respiration was compro-
mised on copper surfaces, and superoxide was generated as part of the killing mechanism. In addition, destruction of
genomic DNA occurs on copper and brass surfaces, allaying concerns about horizontal gene transfer and copper resis-
tance. Incorporation of copper alloy biocidal surfaces may help to reduce the spread of this dangerous pathogen.
I
ntrinsic penicillin resistance and acquisition of resistance to
methicillin in the 1980s by Staphylococcus aureus led to a pan-
demic of infections worldwide. Initially, the majority of infections
were contracted in health care environments, but incorporation of
measures to control the spread, including preadmission screen-
ing, decolonization, improved disinfection, and antibiotic treat-
ment, have stemmed the tide (1). The increased use of antibiotics
required for the epidemic of infections caused by Gram-positive
pathogens has allowed the evolution of multidrug-resistant
Gram-negative pathogens, effectively transforming some com-
mensal gut bacteria into potential killers. However, new strains of
S. aureus that have acquired further virulence factors and toxins or
that have adapted to a specific environment, for example, an in-
creased ability to cause bacteremia (2), are still a considerable
threat. There is now widespread community-associated methicil-
lin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA), and infections can spread
within households, day care centers, and schools (3). In addition,
Giuffre et al. observed an increasing incidence of MRSA in neo-
nates (4). The ability of some strains of MRSA to revert to meth-
icillin-susceptible isolates, particularly in skin and soft tissue in-
fections, has been observed (5).
Colonization with MRSA increases the risk of MRSA infection,
particularly following illness, surgical procedures, and treatment
with immunosuppressive drugs. Colonization and/or infection
may also occur from touching contaminated surfaces. In the com-
munity, a recent study observed that 58% and 82% of surfaces in
19 fire stations in Washington were positive for MRSA and meth-
icillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), respectively (6), and 37% of fire
service professionals had MRSA requiring medical attention. Ot-
ter and French observed that 8% of sites tested in the London
public transport system had MSSA contamination, but no MRSA
was detected (7). The use of biocidal surfaces may play a role in
preventing infection transmission from contaminated surfaces
when combined with stringent cleaning regimes. Laboratory stud-
ies have suggested that copper surfaces may be effective against a
range of bacteria, fungi, and viruses (8–11) and that the irrevers-
ible pathogen nucleic acid destruction observed may allay fears of
biocide resistance (12). A previous study observed that strains of
MRSA were killed on copper surfaces in simulated wet-droplet
contamination (13). However, surface contamination is often the
result of fingertip touch, which dries rapidly. In this study, we
investigated the abilities of several copper alloys to kill MRSA and
MSSA and the mechanism of bacterial death on surfaces contam-
inated by simulated droplet and fingertip touch.

 Metal surfaces. Metal samples were provided by the Copper Develop-
ment Association (Table 1) and were cut into coupons (10 by 10 by 0.5
mm) that were cleaned and sterilized as described previously (14).
Bacterial survival on surfaces assessed by culture and in situ detec-
tion of respiring cells. For simulated fingertip touch contamination, ali-
quots of exponentially growing cultures of the two species in tryptone soy
broth (TSB) were centrifuged to pellet the cells and resuspended in fresh
growth medium to give approximately 107 CFU/�l. One microliter was
spread over the surface of a coupon to allow rapid drying within seconds
and was incubated for various amounts of time. This size of the inoculum
represents a heavy bioburden and permits measuring an endpoint for
inactivation. Cells were removed by vortexing them in phosphate-buff-
ered saline (PBS) with glass beads as described previously (14) (there was
no significant difference if chelators were present to neutralize copper
ions), dilutions were spread onto tryptone soy agar (TSA) plates that were
incubated at 37°C for up to 48 h, and numbers of CFU per coupon were
calculated. Replicate coupons were done for each time point. Simulated
droplet contamination was done by inoculating the same number of cells
in 20 �l per coupon. Cells were also inoculated in the presence of the
chelators EDTA (20 mM) and bathocuproinedisulfonic acid (BCS; 20
mM) to chelate Cu(II) and Cu(I) ions, respectively. Reactive oxygen spe-
cies (ROS) quenchers D-mannitol (20 mM), 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzene-
disulfonic acid (Tiron), and superoxide dismutase (SOD; 500 U/ml) were
used to remove hydroxyl and superoxide radicals, respectively; 500 U/ml
catalase and 10% (wt/vol) sucrose were also used to decompose hydrogen
peroxide and to investigate osmotic stress, respectively.
Respiring bacterial cells produce electrons that reduce the redox dye
CTC (5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride) to insoluble formazan,
which can be visualized as a red fluorescent stain using epifluorescence
microscopy. SYTO 9 is a membrane-permeable dye that binds to intact
double-stranded DNA and emits green fluorescence. The stain will not
bind to degraded nucleic acid. Metal coupons were inoculated as de-
scribed for culture assessment and were stained in situ as described previ-
ously (14). Briefly, cells were dually stained with 5 mM CTC and 5 �M
SYTO 9 for the final 90 and 30 min of the tested 2-h contact time, respec-
tively. Bacterial cells were observed in situ for actively respiring cells (red)
and for all cells with intact DNA, live or dead (green). Cells were also
inoculated in the presence of chelators or ROS quenchers as described for
culture. Stainless steel was used as a control surface throughout.
In situ DNA destruction of MRSA (simulated fingertip touch con-
tamination). Bacterial cells in 1 ml of overnight culture were pelleted and
washed in PBS. The cells were stained with 10 �M SYTO 9 for 30 min at
room temperature. The stained cells were washed to remove excess stain
and resuspended in 50 �l fresh culture medium; 1 �l was applied to metal
coupons, and fluorescence microscopy images were recorded every min-
ute for 20 min.
DNA fragmentation. The protocol was originally described by Fer-
nandez et al. (15) and has been adapted in our laboratory (14). Briefly,
approximately 107 bacterial cells that had been exposed to copper, stain-
less steel, cartridge brass, or Muntz metal for 2 h were treated with 40 U
lysostaphin for 15 min at 37°C. The cells were then encased in low-melt-
ing-point agarose on a slide previously coated with standard agarose. Fol-
lowing membrane permeabilization, the slides were dried and stained
with SYBR gold (Invitrogen, United Kingdom), which detects single- and
double-stranded DNA, for 5 min at room temperature in the dark. Cells
were observed with epifluorescence microscopy for the presence of DNA
loops representing the intact genome or dispersed fragments.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Staphylococcus aureus can persist on surfaces for many months
and is easily transferred to hands contacting surfaces (reviewed by
Kramer et al. [16]). This represents a significant infection risk,
especially in the health care environment and often via the hands
of health care workers. In addition, a recent small study in Egypt
observed that 100% of mobile phones belonging to patients and
health care workers were contaminated with bacterial pathogens,
and MRSA was detected in �50%, which may result in transfer-
ring pathogens out of the health care environment into the com-
munity (17).
A previous study (13) suggested that strains of MRSA applied
as a wet droplet (107 bacteria in 20 �l/cm2) were killed on copper
surfaces in 45 to 90 min of contact, with EMRSA-16 being the
most resilient. In this new study, we have shown that the same
inoculum size of EMRSA-16 applied in a low volume that dries in
seconds, to simulate fingertip contamination, was killed in 20
min, and almost a 5 log-reduction occurred within the first 10 min
(Fig. 1A). Fingertip touch will also contaminate the surface with
biomolecules transferred from the skin surface, so the cells were
inoculated in bacteriological medium, which contains a complex
mixture of proteins, salts, and sugars. Following 30 min of contact,
there was a 2-log reduction in viable cells on cartridge brass (70%
copper) and a complete kill on copper nickel 10 (90% copper),
which has been shown previously to have excellent antiviral activ-
ity. The results were similar for MSSA, except complete killing on
copper occurred within 15 min (Fig. 1B). A previous study ob-
served that exposure of MRSA to copper inhibits respiration and
compromises DNA integrity (18). Analysis of the bacterial DNA
in situ on copper surfaces in the new study suggested that rapid
destruction occurs over the first 5 min of contact, which does not
occur on stainless steel (Fig. 2) and is equivalent to an approxi-
mately 2-log reduction in viable cells observed in the culture re-
sults (Fig. 1). This suggests that the development of copper resis-
tance is unlikely and that the problems that have arisen with using
some biocides and with concomitant antibiotic resistance (19)
should not occur with the use of antimicrobial copper surfaces.
Further investigations into the mechanism of copper killing of
MRSA were done for the two types of surface contamination. Ch-
elators of Cu(I) and Cu(II) offered significant protection for
EMRSA-16 on copper surfaces (Fig. 3A and C), suggesting that
these moieties are directly or indirectly responsible for bacterial
death. Generation of free radicals has been suggested to be in-
volved in the copper kill mechanism, and the quenching potential
of superoxide generation with membrane-permeable Tiron gave
significant protection on copper surfaces for droplet contamina-
tion (Fig. 3B); however, the addition of superoxide dismutase
(SOD) to dismutate superoxide was not as effective. This may be
because the enzyme activity is reduced at the neutral pH used in
the test procedure or that the large protein was unable to cross the
cell membrane to dismutate intracellular superoxide. Tiron was
protective for simulated dry-touch contamination but only after

 the initial 10 min of contact; thereafter, there were still log-3 sur-
vivors on copper after 20 min (Fig. 3D). D-Mannitol displayed a
minimal protective effect, suggesting that hydroxyl radicals were
not the primary instigators of bacterial death on copper (Fig. 3B
and D). It has been shown that generation of highly toxic hydroxyl
radicals via Fenton reaction between Cu(I) and hydrogen perox-
ide combined with direct copper ion action led to the rapid death
of Gram-negative bacteria on copper surfaces (20). The results
from this new study suggest that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are
involved in bacterial killing on copper but not via Fenton chem-
istry. This was further supported when removal of copper ionic
species (by chelators) and superoxide (by quenchers) allowed the
bacterial cells to continue respiring and DNA to remain intact
(Fig. 4), but addition of D-mannitol to quench hydroxyl radi-
cals and catalase to decompose hydrogen peroxide was not pro-
tective. Further evidence for the DNA damage can be observed
using the genomic DNA fragmentation assay. Bacteria exposed
to stainless steel display intact loops of genomic DNA emanat-
ing from and surrounding each lysed bacterial cell, but in cells
previously exposed to copper and copper alloys, the DNA has
degraded to small fragments that are too small to be visualized
(Fig. 5). The loss of genomic DNA was commensurate with cell
death.
These results are comparable to the mechanism of copper tox-
icity that was observed by our laboratory for other Gram-positive
bacteria, i.e., pathogenic enterococci (21). This supports our pre-
vious conclusions that the mechanism of bacterial death on cop-
per surfaces is multifaceted and involves a combination of direct
copper ion attack of bacterial structural and metabolic biomol-
ecules and suicidal generation of ROS. Although Gram-posi-

were removed after various contact times at 21°C as described in the text, and they were assessed for viability by growth on agar. Results are expressed as CFU per
coupon (� SEM) and are the results of multiple experiments.
FIG 2 Destruction of the DNA of an epidemic strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (EMRSA) on copper surfaces. Approximately 107 bacterial
cells were prestained with SYTO 9, which intercalates into intact DNA, and were applied to copper surfaces. Cells with intact DNA appear green using
epifluorescence microscopy. Images were recorded every minute (at different fields of view to eliminate the bleaching effect of the excitation light source). A rapid
reduction in cells with intact DNA occurred on copper surfaces following the first 5 min of contact. In contrast, there was no reduction in the staining of cells
exposed to stainless steel for the experiment duration.

 tive and Gram-negative bacteria die on copper surfaces, the
targets vary and rapid breakdown of nucleic acid is observed in
the former.
The tide of MRSA infections observed in the 1980s has been
reduced by implementation of many interventions, including
screening regimes, isolation, decolonization, antibiotic steward-
ship, and disinfection, and has been superseded by multidrug-
resistant Enterobacteriaceae. We must guard against complacency,
especially with the increase in Staphylococcus aureus community
infections and the evolution of strains with increased virulence.
FIG 3 Determination of the role of copper ions and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the rapid death of an epidemic strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (EMRSA) on copper surfaces. Approximately 107 cells were applied to copper surfaces in 20 �l to simulate wet-droplet (A, B) or dry-touch (C, D)
contamination as described in the text. If cells were inoculated in the presence of the chelators BCS and EDTA to chelate Cu(I) and Cu(II), respectively, a
protective effect was seen in the droplet and dry-touch scenarios compared to that in inoculation in PBS (A, C). Inoculation in the presence of Tiron to quench
superoxide generation also had a significant protective effect, especially in the droplet contamination (B), although superoxide dismutase (SOD) protection was
much lower. D-Mannitol, which quenches hydroxyl radicals, had a small protective effect in simulated droplet contamination (B).
FIG 4 Protection of bacterial DNA and respiration with chelators and reactive
oxygen species quenchers in an epidemic strain of methicillin-resistant Staph-
ylococcus aureus (EMRSA) exposed to copper surfaces (simulated droplet con-
tamination). Approximately 107 cells were applied to copper surfaces in 20 �l
of PBS or PBS supplemented with chelators or ROS quenchers. During 2 h of
contact time at 21°C, the cells were dually stained in situ with CTC and SYTO
9 to detect actively respiring cells (fluoresce red) and total cells with intact
DNA (fluoresce green), respectively, as described in the text. Cells inoculated
in PBS did not stain with either stain, suggesting that cells were not respiring
and DNA had disintegrated. However, when EDTA, BCS, and Tiron were
present, the bacterial DNA was protected and cells respired; this suggests that
Cu(II), Cu(I), and superoxide generation, respectively, are required for the
killing mechanism on copper. No protective effect was observed on copper
surfaces with D-mannitol, catalase, or sucrose (not shown). Cells exposed to
stainless steel surfaces in PBS or with any supplements displayed intact DNA
and active respiration (not shown).
FIG 5 Exposure to copper and brass surfaces affects the DNA of an epidemic
strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (EMRSA) (simulated
droplet contamination). The DNA fragmentation assay allows the DNA integ-
rity of individual bacterial cells to be observed. Bacteria were exposed to cop-
per, brass, and stainless steel surfaces for 2 h at 21°C (�1°C), immersed in
agarose, permeabilized, and stained as described in the text. On steel, individ-
ual cells with intact DNA loops protruding though the permeabilized mem-
brane can be seen. There is virtually no stained DNA in cells exposed to copper
and brasses, suggesting that extensive disintegration of the DNA has occurred.

 This study is the first to show very rapid killing of fingertip con-
tamination of MRSA and MSSA on copper alloys, and the authors
propose that incorporation of copper alloy surfaces may help to
reduce the transmission of MRSA and MSSA from contaminated
surfaces. The real-life bacterial bioburden is considerably less than
that tested here, suggesting that kill times may be even faster, and
a hospital trial has already shown that incorporation of just 6
copper surfaces in intensive care units significantly reduced
MRSA colonization and health care-acquired infection over a 12-
month period (22, 23). Further trials are now urgently needed to
determine if the wealth of data from laboratory studies showing
high efficacy of copper alloys to kill or inactivate a large range of
microbial pathogens can be extrapolated to real-life environments
to reduce the number of infections contracted from touching con-
taminated surfaces.
