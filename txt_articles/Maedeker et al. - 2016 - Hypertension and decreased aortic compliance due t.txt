Abstract
Background and Aims—High blood pressure and reduced aortic compliance are associated 
with increased atherosclerotic plaque accumulation in humans. Animal studies support these 
associations, but additional factors, such as fragmented elastic fibers, are present in most previous 
animal studies. Elastin heterozygous (Eln+/−) mice have high blood pressure and reduced aortic 
compliance, with no evidence of elastic fiber fragmentation and represent an appropriate model to 
directly investigate the effects of these factors on atherosclerosis
Methods and Results—Eln+/− and Eln+/+ mice were crossed with low density lipoprotein 
receptor knockout (Ldlr−/−) and wild-type (Ldlr+/+) mice and fed normal or Western diet (WD) 
for 16 weeks. We hypothesized that on WD, Eln+/−Ldlr−/− mice with high blood pressure and 
reduced aortic compliance would have increased atherosclerotic plaque accumulation compared to 
Eln+/+Ldlr−/− mice. We measured serum cholesterol and cytokine levels, blood pressure, aortic 
compliance, and plaque accumulation. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that on WD, Eln+/
−Ldlr−/− mice do not have increased plaque accumulation compared to Eln+/+Ldlr−/− mice. At 
the aortic root, there are no significant differences in plaque area between Eln+/−Ldlr−/− and Eln
+/+Ldlr−/− mice on WD (p = .89), while in the ascending aorta, Eln+/−Ldlr−/− mice on WD have 
29% less normalized plaque area than Eln+/+Ldlr−/− mice on WD (p = 0.009).
Conclusion—Using an atherogenic mouse model, we conclude that increased blood pressure 
and reduced aortic compliance are not direct causes of increased aortic plaque accumulation. We

Introduction
Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease with both environmental and genetic 
components1, 2. High systolic blood pressure3–6 and decreased aortic compliance7, 8 are 
associated with increased atherosclerotic plaque accumulation, although the relationships are 
complicated and often contradictory. Better understanding of the risk factors in 
atherosclerosis would help inform preventative and palliative care. Although they have 
limitations, mouse models of atherosclerosis, including apolipoprotein-E (Apoe−/−)9, 10 and 
low density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr−/−)11 deficient animals, have become invaluable tools 
for studying mechanisms of atherosclerosis12. Apoe−/− and Ldlr−/− mice fed a Western diet 
(WD, 20% fat, 0.15% cholesterol) develop hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.
Previously, Van Herck et al.13 investigated the relationship between atherosclerosis and 
aortic compliance by crossing Apoe−/− mice with mice haploinsufficient for a mutation in 
the fibrillin-1 gene (C1039G+/−). The authors found that on WD C1039G+/−Apoe−/− mice 
had decreased aortic compliance, which led to increased accumulation of atherosclerotic 
plaque, and promoted plaque instability compared to C1039G+/+Apoe−/− mice. Fibrillin-1 
is a major component of microfibrils in the extracellular matrix that associate with 
developing elastic fibers. Mutations in fibrillin-1 cause Marfan Syndrome, an autosomal 
dominant disorder with skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular manifestations. Cardiovascular 
symptoms include dilation and dissection of the ascending aorta14, and have been associated 
with dysregulated transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling15. C1039G−/− mice 
die soon after birth due to failure of the arterial wall, while C1039G+/− mice show defects in 
elastic fiber structure and local elastolysis, but have a normal lifespan16, 17. Elastic fiber 
fragmentation and injection of elastin-derived peptides have been shown to potentiate 
atherosclerosis18. It is possible that TGF-β signaling and elastic fiber fragmentation 
contribute to the increased plaque accumulation and instability in C1039G+/−Apoe−/− mice, 
and that decreased aortic compliance is not a major factor.
During elastic fiber formation, microfibrils interact with tropoelastin, which is then 
crosslinked into insoluble elastin. Elastin haploinsufficient mice (Eln+/−) mice have about 
60% of wild-type elastin levels, stable hypertension, and decreased aortic compliance19. 
Elastin haploinsufficiency in humans causes Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis, which can occur 
as an isolated disease or as a component of Williams-Beuren Syndrome20. Mice and humans 
with elastin haploinsufficiency have thinner, more numerous elastic lamellae across the 
aortic wall, but they do not appear fragmented21. Hence, Eln+/− mice represent an 
appropriate model to isolate the effects of aortic compliance and hypertension on 
atherosclerosis progression, without complications of elastic fiber fragmentation and 
dysregulated TGF-β signaling. We bred Eln+/− mice to Ldlr−/− mice and fed them WD. We

 measured serum lipid and cytokine levels, blood pressure, aortic compliance, and 
atherosclerotic plaque accumulation and composition to determine if increased blood 
pressure and decreased aortic compliance in Eln+/−Ldlr−/− mice leads to increased plaque 
accumulation compared to Eln+/+Ldlr−/− mice.
Materials and Methods
Mice
Female B6.129S7-Ldlrtm1Her/J −/− (Ldlr−/−) (Jackson Laboratory, stock #002207) were bred 
with male Eln+/− mice22. Males at the F3 – F6 generation were used because previous data 
on blood pressure and aortic stiffness in Eln+/− mice were obtained for males19. Genotypes 
included in the study are: Eln+/+Ldlr−/−, Eln+/−Ldlr−/−, Eln+/+Ldlr+/+, Eln+/−Ldlr+/+. 
After weaning at three weeks of age, mice were provided with normal diet (ND) or WD 
(AIN-76A, Purina Test Labs) for 16 weeks. All protocols were approved by the Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee.
Blood pressure, serum chemistry, and tissue collection
Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and intra-aortic blood pressure was measured 
with a 1.2F solid-state catheter (Transonic). Whole blood was collected from a subset of 
mice via cardiac puncture and serum was separated. Lipid levels were quantified by 
Advanced Veterinary Laboratory using an automated chemistry analyzer. Additional serum 
samples for Eln+/+Ldlr−/− and Eln+/−Ldlr−/− mice on ND and WD were analyzed for 
inflammatory cytokines and TGF-β1 using electrochemiluminescence immunoassays from 
Mesoscale Discovery and read on a MESO Quickplex SQ 120. Only analytes with levels 
higher than 10 pg/ml on the mouse inflammatory cytokine multiplex assay are presented. 
These include interleukin 6 (IL6), interleukin 10 (IL10), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 
(CXCL1), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF).
The heart was removed and the proximal region was frozen at −80°C in Tissue Tek OCT for 
sectioning of the aortic root. In about half of the mice, the ascending aorta was removed for 
mechanical testing and a small piece of the left carotid artery was fixed for wall structure 
analysis. In the rest of the mice, the entire aorta from the root to the iliac bifurcation was 
removed for en face plaque analysis.
Mechanical testing
The ascending aorta was mounted at the approximate in vivo length in a pressure myograph 
(110P, Danish Myotechnology) in physiologic saline solution at 37°C, as described 
previously23. Arteries were inflated from 0 – 175 mmHg in steps of 25 mmHg (12 sec/step) 
while pressure, outer diameter, and axial force were recorded at 1 Hz. The diameter 
compliance was calculated as the change in diameter for each pressure step, and is an 
inverse measure of aortic stiffness.
Plaque quantification and characterization
Aortas for en face preparation were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin overnight, cut 
longitudinally, pinned to black dissection wax, stained with Oil Red O in propylene glycol,

 and imaged24. Outlines of the ascending, thoracic, and descending regions of the aorta were 
defined and positive Oil Red O pixels were traced manually in Image J (NIH). Plaque area 
for each region was normalized to the aortic surface area. For aortic valve analysis, 5 μm 
frozen sections of the aortic root were cut with a cryostat. Slides were stained with Oil Red 
O in 60% isopropanol25, but were not counterstained. Images were taken of slides at ~10 μm 
intervals. Three images for each mouse where clear sections of the aortic valves could be 
seen were analyzed for total Oil Red O positive pixels using Matlab software (Mathworks) 
and averaged.
Adjacent sections of the aortic valves for a subset of Eln+/+Ldlr−/− and Eln+/−Ldlr−/− mice 
on WD were stained with F4/80 antibody (ab16911, Abcam) followed by DAB and imaged 
to visualize macrophage content and localization. Adjacent sections of the aortic valves for 
the same mice were also examined by fluorescence microscopy. Sections were labeled for 
elastin, collagen, smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and cell nuclei. Alexa Fluor 633 Hydrazide 
(Life Technologies) was used for elastin26, 27. CNA35 (kindly provided by Magnus Hook, 
Texas A&M) labeled with Oregon Green 488 (Life Technologies) was used for collagen28. 
Alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA) primary antibody (A5228, Sigma) followed by Alexa 
Fluor 555 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Life Technologies) was used for SMCs. The 
cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 34580 (Life Technologies). The percentage of the 
plaque area staining positive for F4/80, αSMA, and collagen was calculated from 
thresholded images of at least two aortic valves/mouse using Image J software.
Arterial wall structure
Sections of the left common carotid artery were examined by histology for seven Eln+/+Ldlr
−/− and six Eln+/−Ldlr−/− mice on WD. Two – three mm long pieces of the artery were 
fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin overnight, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, 
embedded in paraffin, sectioned, stained with H&E, Verhoeff Van Gieson (VVG) or 
picrosirius red (PSR) and imaged.
Statistics
Three-way ANOVA (SPSS) was used to evaluate the effects of diet, Ldlr genotype, Eln 
genotype and the interactions between each independent variable on the measured dependent 
variables. Cytokine levels were only measured in Ldlr−/− mice, so two-way ANOVA was 
used to evaluate the effects of diet and Eln genotype. Additionally, two-way student's t-test 
with unequal variance was used to evaluate differences in plaque amounts and composition 
between Eln+/−Ldlr−/− and Eln+/+Ldlr−/− mice on WD. P < 0.05 was considered 
significant.
Results
Cholesterol increases with WD and Ldlr−/− genotype, but is not affected by Eln genotype
Total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels all increase with 
WD (200 – 400%), Ldlr−/− genotype (400 – 4000%), and show a significant interaction 
between diet and Ldlr genotype (Table 1). Eln genotype does not affect total cholesterol,

 triglyceride, or LDL levels. High density lipoprotein (HDL) levels are increased about 40% 
with WD, but are not affected by Ldlr or Eln genotype (Table 1).
Systolic and pulse pressure increase with WD, Ldlr−/− genotype and Eln+/− genotype
Systolic pressure is increased 8% with WD, 6% with Ldlr−/− genotype, and 10% with Eln+/
− genotype, with no interactions between the independent variables (Table 1). Diastolic 
blood pressure is increased 7% with WD, but is not affected by Ldlr or Eln genotype (Table 
1). Pulse pressure is increased 11% with WD, 13% with Ldlr−/− genotype, and 20% with 
Eln+/− genotype, with interactions between diet and Ldlr genotype and all three independent 
variables (Table 1). Heart rate is not significantly affected by diet, Ldlr or Eln genotype 
(Table 1).
Aortic compliance is reduced in Eln+/− mice at systolic pressures, but is not affected by 
diet or Ldlr genotype
Average pressure-diameter curves are shown in Fig. 1A. Ldlr genotype and diet do not have 
significant effects on the diameter for any applied pressure. Diameter is decreased 7 – 11% 
at pressures between 0 – 50 and 150 – 175 mmHg in Eln+/− mice (p = <.001 – .013). There 
are significant interactions between Eln genotype and diet at 0 – 50 mmHg (p = .007 – .042) 
and between all three independent variables at pressures above 0 mmHg (p = .001 – .045). 
Average pressure-compliance curves are shown in Fig. 1B. Ldlr genotype and diet do not 
have significant effects on the compliance for any applied pressure. The compliance curves 
for Eln+/− mice are shifted so that the peak occurs at lower pressures than Eln+/+, with a 
steep drop in compliance at higher pressures. At pressures of 50 and 75 mmHg, compliance 
is 21 – 43% higher in Eln+/− aorta compared to Eln+/+ (p = <.001 and .004). At pressures 
between 100 – 175 mmHg (near and above systolic pressure values), compliance is 19 – 
53% lower in Eln+/− aorta compared to Eln+/+ (p = <.001 – .004). There are significant 
interactions between Eln and Ldlr genotype at pressures between 0 – 75 mmHg (p = .002 – .
017).
Atherosclerotic plaque is not increased in Eln+/− mice
Cross-sections of the aortic root were stained with Oil Red O to estimate atherosclerotic 
plaque accumulation. Total plaque at the aortic root is increased with WD (p < 0.001) and 
Ldlr−/− genotype (p < 0.001), but is not affected by Eln genotype (p = 0.991). There are 
significant interactions between diet and Ldlr genotype (p < 0.001). There are no significant 
differences for the plaque area at the aortic root between Eln+/+Ldlr−/− and Eln+/−Ldlr−/− 
mice on WD (p = 0.89) (Fig. 2A). Representative images of plaque at the aortic root are 
shown in Figs. 2B and C. En face preparations of the aorta were stained with Oil Red O as 
an additional estimate of plaque accumulation. As most of the plaque accumulation occurs 
in the ascending aorta in Ldlr−/− mice after 16 weeks of WD, we focused our analyses on 
that region. The fraction of ascending aortic lumen covered in plaque is increased with WD 
(p < 0.001) and Ldlr−/− genotype (p < 0.001), and is decreased in Eln+/− mice (p = 0.010). 
There are significant interactions between all two-way combinations and the three-way 
combination of independent variables (p < 0.001 – 0.011). Eln+/−Ldlr−/− mice on WD have 
29% less normalized plaque area in the ascending aorta than Eln+/+Ldlr−/− mice on WD (p 
= 0.009) (Fig. 2D). Representative images of plaque in the ascending aorta are shown in

 Figs. 2E and F. In the thoracic and abdominal regions, there are no significant differences in 
plaque accumulation between Eln+/+Ldlr−/− and Eln+/−Ldlr−/− mice on WD, but the 
plaque amounts in these regions are highly variable (Supplemental Fig. I). When total 
normalized plaque area of the entire aorta is calculated, there are no significant differences 
in plaque amounts between Eln+/+Ldlr−/− and Eln+/−Ldlr−/− mice on WD (Supplemental 
Fig. I).
Cross-sections of the aortic root for Eln+/+Ldlr−/− and Eln+/−Ldlr−/− mice on WD were 
analyzed for plaque composition. Representative F4/80 images for macrophage amount and 
localization are shown in Figs. 3A and B. The plaques have a layer of macrophages on top of 
a necrotic core, with no differences in the amount of F4/80 positive cells (Fig. 3E). 
Fluorescence staining for elastin, collagen, SMCs, and cell nuclei for the same plaques are 
shown in Figs. 3C and D. A layer of SMCs is located on top of the necrotic core, where 
there are few cell nuclei. There are no differences in the amount of cells staining positively 
for αSMA (Fig. 3F). Collagen stains brightly in the valves and faintly under the SMCs. 
There is a significant increase in area of the plaque staining positively for collagen in Eln+/
−Ldlr−/− mice on WD compared to Eln+/+Ldlr−/− mice on WD (p = 0.02) (Fig. 3G).
Circulating cytokine levels are not affected by Eln genotype
Immunoassays were used to measure serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and TGF-β1 in 
Eln+/+Ldlr−/− and Eln+/−Ldlr−/− mice on ND and WD. IL6, IL10, CXCL1, and TNF are 
increased 140 – 600% with WD, but are not affected by Eln genotype (Table 2). TGF-β1 
levels are not affected by diet or Eln genotype (Table 2).
Elastic fibers are not fragmented in Eln+/− arteries
Cross-sections of the left common carotid artery were processed for histology to visualize 
the wall structure away from the plaque area of Eln+/+Ldlr−/− and Eln+/−Ldlr−/− mice on 
WD (Fig. 4). H&E staining shows similar cell density and orientation. VVG staining shows 
that Eln+/−Ldlr−/− arteries have thinner, more numerous elastic lamellae than Eln+/+Ldlr−/
− arteries, with no evidence of increased elastic fiber fragmentation. PSR staining shows that 
collagen organization appears similar in Eln+/+Ldlr−/− and Eln+/−Ldlr−/− arteries.
Discussion
Eln+/+ and Eln+/− mice were bred with Ldlr+/+ and Ldlr−/− mice and fed ND or WD for 16 
weeks after weaning to determine if hypertension and decreased aortic compliance in Eln+/
−Ldlr−/− mice increases atherosclerotic plaque accumulation compared to Eln+/+Ldlr−/− 
mice. WD increases total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL and HDL levels. Ldlr−/− genotype 
increases total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL levels. Total cholesterol and triglyceride 
changes are consistent with previous studies of Ldlr mice on WD29–31. LDL and HDL levels 
are also consistent with previous results for Ldlr mice on WD32. The serum cholesterol 
measurements confirm that the combination of diet and Ldlr genotype has the expected 
results on Eln mice.
WD, Ldlr−/− genotype, and Eln+/− genotype increase systolic blood pressure and pulse 
pressure, with Eln+/− genotype having the most significant effect. WD has been shown to

 increase blood pressure in wild-type mice33, 34. To our knowledge, Ldlr−/− genotype has not 
previously been associated with increases in systolic or pulse pressure. Eln+/− mice are 
known to have increased systolic and pulse pressure19, 35. Our blood pressure results 
confirm previous studies and show that Eln+/−Ldlr−/− mice on WD have the highest systolic 
and pulse pressure of all groups. The increase in pulse pressure for Eln+/− mice is similar to 
the increase in pulse pressure for aging humans36. In clinical studies, there are significant 
associations between high blood pressure and atherosclerotic plaque accumulation3–6, but 
animal studies of relationships between hypertension and atherosclerosis have been 
contradictory37.
One complication in animal studies is that modulation of the renin-angiotensin system 
(RAS) is often used to alter blood pressure. Ang II is the active end product of the RAS and 
has a range of effects on cells including encouraging proliferation and apoptosis and 
activating inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways38. Infusing Ang II in Apoe−/− mice 
accelerates atherosclerosis39, while inhibiting Ang II in Apoe−/− mice through 
pharmaceutical40 or genetic41 approaches reduces plaque accumulation, independent of 
blood pressure lowering effects. When norepinephrine or Ang II are infused in Apoe−/− 
mice to obtain equivalent increases in blood pressure, there are much more modest increases 
in plaque amounts with norepinephrine than Ang II compared to control. However, 
norepinephrine still causes increased blood pressure and increased plaque deposition 
compared to control42. Previous studies showed that renin activity is high in Eln+/− mice, 
suggesting increased levels of Ang II, but aldosterone levels are normal, suggesting that 
downstream effects of Ang II may be mediated differentially in Eln+/− mice19. Increased 
blood pressure and increased renin activity in Eln+/− mice would be expected to increase 
atherosclerotic plaque accumulation in a hyperlipidemic model, but our results show that Eln
+/−Ldlr−/− mice on WD have similar or reduced plaque amounts compared to controls.
Two recent studies investigate links between hypertension and atherosclerosis in animals 
without RAS activation. Vitamin D deficiency coupled with WD in Ldlr−/− and Apoe−/− 
mice increases blood pressure and increases atherosclerotic plaque accumulation43. 
However, vitamin D deficiency also activates macrophage ER stress and accelerates 
atherosclerosis by inducing phenotypic changes in macrophages. Plaque accumulation in 
vitamin D deficiency is decreased by a chemical chaperone that decreases ER stress, without 
any effects on blood pressure, indicating that macrophage ER stress is the driving factor for 
plaque accumulation, not blood pressure. Compared to ND, a low sodium diet given to Apoe
−/− mice results in normal blood pressure, increased inflammatory markers, and increased 
atherosclerotic plaque accumulation44. Contrarily, high sodium diet given to Apoe−/− mice 
results in high blood pressure, decreased inflammatory markers and decreased 
atherosclerotic plaque accumulation, indicating that inflammatory markers are associated 
with atherosclerosis, but high blood pressure is not. The data from the vitamin D and sodium 
studies highlight the role of inflammation over hypertension as a factor in atherosclerosis 
susceptibility.
The results of the vitamin D and sodium studies are consistent with our findings that Eln+/
−Ldlr−/− mice with hypertension, but no indication of abnormal inflammation in the aortic 
wall, do not have increased plaque accumulation compared to Eln+/+Ldlr−/− mice on WD.

 Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, IL6, IL10, CXCL1, and TNF, which all play 
important roles in atherogenesis45, are increased in Ldlr−/− mice on WD compared to ND, 
but are not different in Eln+/− mice compared to Eln+/+. Macrophage amounts and 
localization are not different in aortic root plaques in Eln+/+Ldlr−/− and Eln+/−Ldlr−/− 
mice on WD, indicating that the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the plaque is not 
affected by elastin haploinsufficiency and the resulting hypertension and reduced aortic 
compliance. Although SMC amounts are similar, collagen amounts are higher in aortic root 
plaques for Eln+/−Ldlr−/− mice on WD compared to Eln+/+Ldlr−/− mice on WD, 
indicating increased plaque stability2.
Aortic compliance is significantly lower in Eln+/− mice than Eln+/+ at physiologic 
pressures, consistent with previous studies19, 23. Diet and Ldlr genotype have no significant 
effects on aortic compliance. In B6D2F1 mice, WD decreases aortic compliance as 
measured by pulse wave velocity46 and in vitro mechanical tests47. Previous studies have 
found reduced aortic compliance in Ldlr−/− mice48. Differences in the effects of diet and 
Ldlr genotype on aortic compliance may be due to differences in mouse strain, diet protocol, 
and measurement methods. Despite significantly decreased aortic compliance, Eln+/−Ldlr−/
− mice on WD do not show increased atherosclerotic plaque accumulation or decreased 
plaque stability.
C1039G+/−Apoe−/− mice have decreased aortic compliance and increased plaque 
accumulation and decreased plaque stability, with no changes in blood pressure compared to 
control mice13. C1039G+/− mice have fragmented elastic fibers16, 17 and dysregulated TGF-
β signaling15. Injecting elastin-derived peptides increases plaque accumulation in Apoe−/− 
mice on ND and Ldlr−/− mice on WD18. The effect is blocked in the absence of immune 
PI3Kγ, indicating that fragmentation of elastic fibers, release of elastin-derived peptides, and 
the subsequent immune response may contribute to increased plaque accumulation in 
C1039G+/−Apoe−/− mice. TGF-β has complex effects on atherosclerosis and immune 
reactivity in mouse and man49, 50, but it is reasonable to believe that altered TGF-β 
regulation may also affect atherosclerosis accumulation in C1039G+/−Apoe−/− mice, 
independent of reductions in aortic compliance. C1039G+/− mice have higher levels of 
circulating TGF-β1 that increase with age and correlate with aortic root dilation51. We found 
no significant differences in circulating TGF-β1 levels between Eln+/+Ldlr−/− and Eln+/
−Ldlr−/− mice on ND or WD. TGF-β signaling could be further investigated through 
quantification of gene and protein levels of TGF-β pathway members within the aortic wall 
at different time points, but our current results show no evidence of altered TGF-β signaling 
in Eln+/− mice.
In human studies, a 3 – 21% reduction in arterial compliance is observed in individuals with 
atherosclerotic plaques, compared to individuals with no detectable plaques7, 8. The 
reduction in compliance is consistent with that observed in Eln+/− mice at systolic blood 
pressure. However, human studies generally include older individuals (mean age > 65)7, 8. 
Elastin degrades and fragments with age, leading to decreased aortic compliance52, 53. 
Because elastin degradation and decreased aortic compliance are intimately related, it is 
difficult to separate them in human studies with aging individuals or in mouse models with 
fragmented elastic fibers. Eln+/− mice are unique in that they have reduced aortic

 compliance, but no indication of elastic fiber fragmentation. Our data show that Eln+/−Ldlr
−/− mice on WD do not have increased atherosclerotic plaque accumulation or instability 
compared to Eln+/+Ldlr−/− mice on WD. Our results suggest that additional insults, besides 
high blood pressure and low aortic compliance, such as activation of inflammatory pathways 
through elastic fiber fragmentation or TGF-β dysregulation, are necessary to alter 
atherosclerosis progression.
Limitations
Atherosclerosis in mice is different than in humans. However, mice allow us to investigate 
specific contributions to atherosclerosis in a controlled manner that cannot be done in human 
studies. We used Ldlr−/− mice as our atherogenic model and may have observed different 
results in another model. We measured plaque accumulation at one specific time point, so 
we may have missed differences in the time course of plaque progression that depend on 
blood pressure or aortic compliance. We examined plaque composition and cytokine levels 
in a subset of Eln+/+Ldlr−/− and Eln+/−Ldlr−/− mice on WD. More comprehensive 
analyses of plaque composition and progression and cytokine signaling are needed to 
determine if Eln+/− genotype affects characteristics of atherosclerotic disease other than 
plaque amounts. We measured anesthetized blood pressure, which will be different than 
ambulatory blood pressure. Although absolute pressure values vary between anesthetized 
and awake animals, the differences between groups are likely to remain. We suggest that 
additional insults, such as elastic fiber fragmentation, are necessary to alter atherosclerosis 
progression. Alternate mouse models, such as fibulin-5 knockout mice (Fbln5−/−), that have 
reduced aortic compliance, as well as fragmented elastic fibers54, 55 could be used to further 
investigate this idea.

 Highlights
-
Elastin insufficient (Eln+/−) mice have hypertension and reduced aortic 
compliance.
-
Eln+/−Ldlr−/− mice do not have more atherosclerotic plaque than Eln+/+Ldlr
−/− mice.
-
Hypertension and reduced aortic compliance may not directly affect 
atherosclerosis.

 Figure 1. 
Ascending aortic diameter is reduced in Eln+/− mice compared to Eln+/+ (A, B), as 
determined from in vitro mechanical tests. Ascending aortic compliance, calculated as the 
local slope of the pressure-diameter curve, is reduced in Eln+/− mice compared to Eln+/+ at 
pressures near and above systolic values (C, D). Diet and Ldlr genotype have no significant 
effects on the diameter or compliance at any pressure. N = 4 – 8/group. * = P < .05 for Eln 
genotype by three-way ANOVA.

Atherosclerotic plaque amounts are similar or reduced in Eln+/−Ldlr−/− mice on WD 
compared to Eln+/+Ldlr−/− mice on WD, despite high blood pressure and reduced aortic 
compliance in Eln+/−Ldlr−/− mice. Total plaque area at the level of the aortic valve is 
similar in Eln+/+Ldlr−/− and Eln+/−Ldlr−/− mice on WD (A), as quantified by Oil Red O 
staining of aortic root sections (B, C). N = 10 – 16/group. Normalized (norm) plaque area in 
the ascending aorta is reduced in Eln+/−Ldlr−/− mice on WD compared to Eln+/+Ldlr−/− 
mice on WD (D), as quantified by Oil Red O staining of en face preparations of the 
ascending aorta (E, F). N = 6 – 9/group. Significance between Eln+/+Ldlr−/− and Eln+/
−Ldlr−/− mice on WD determined by student's t-test.

 Figure 3. 
Macrophage and SMC amounts are similar, but collagen amount is increased for aortic root 
plaques in Eln+/−Ldlr−/− mice on WD compared to Eln+/+Ldlr−/− mice on WD. F4/80 
staining shows a layer of macrophages on top of a necrotic core (A, B). Fluorescent staining 
of the same plaque shows αSMA positive cells (red) on top of the necrotic core containing 
few cell nuclei (blue). Collagen (green) stains brightly in the valve tissue and shows patchy 
staining (arrows) below the layer of αSMA positive cells. Elastic fibers (magenta) are visible 
in the aortic wall. Quantification of the percent area of the plaque staining positively for 
F4/80 (E), αSMA (F), and collagen (G) shows an increase in collagen amounts for Eln+/
−Ldlr−/− mice. N = 3 – 6/group.

across the arterial wall than Eln+/+Ldlr−/− mice on WD, but the lamellae are not 
fragmented. N = 6 – 7/group. There is also no evidence of elastic fiber fragmentation at the

Table 1
Serum cholesterol levels and blood pressures in Eln+/+ and Eln+/− mice crossed with Ldlr+/+ and Ldlr−/− mice and fed ND or WD for 16 weeks after 
weaning. Total cholesterol, triglyceride (tri), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) serum concentrations were measured. 
Diet and Ldlr genotype significantly affect most measures of serum cholesterol, while Eln genotype does not. Systolic (sys) and pulse pressures measured 
with a solid-state catheter are significantly affected by diet, Ldlr genotype, and Eln genotype, while diastolic (dias) pressures are affected only by diet. 
Heart rate (hr) is not affected by any of the independent variables. Significance was determined by three-way ANOVA for diet, Ldlr genotype, Eln 
genotype and all two- and three-way interactions.

Levels of inflammatory cytokines and TGF-β1 were measured using electrochemiluminescence immunoassays 
on serum from Eln+/+Ldlr−/− and Eln+/−Ldlr−/− mice and fed ND or WD for 16 weeks after weaning. IL6, 
IL10, CXCL1, and TNF levels are significantly affected by diet, but not Eln genotype. TGF-β1 levels are not 
affected by diet or Eln genotype. Significance was determined by two-way ANOVA for diet, Eln genotype and
