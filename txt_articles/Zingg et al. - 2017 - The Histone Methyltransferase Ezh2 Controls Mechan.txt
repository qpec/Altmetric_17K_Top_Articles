In Brief
Zingg et al. investigate the mechanisms
of adaptive resistance to tumor
immunotherapy. They find that
intratumoral TNF-a production and T cell
accumulation promote Ezh2 upregulation
in melanoma cells, resulting in loss of
immunogenicity and antigen
presentation. Ezh2 inactivation reverses
these effects and synergizes with anti-
CTLA-4 and IL-2 immunotherapies.

SUMMARY
Immunotherapy and particularly immune check-
point inhibitors have resulted in remarkable clinical
responses in patients with immunogenic tumors,
although most cancers develop resistance to immu-
notherapy. The molecular mechanisms of tumor
resistance to immunotherapy remain poorly under-
stood. We now show that induction of the histone
methyltransferase Ezh2 controls several tumor cell-
intrinsic
and
extrinsic
resistance
mechanisms.
Notably, T cell infiltration selectively correlated with
high EZH2-PRC2 complex activity in human skin
cutaneous melanoma. During anti-CTLA-4 or IL-2
immunotherapy in mice, intratumoral tumor necrosis
factor-a (TNF-a) production and T cell accumulation
resulted in increased Ezh2 expression in melanoma
cells, which in turn silenced their own immunoge-
nicity and antigen presentation. Ezh2 inactivation
reversed this resistance and synergized with anti-
CTLA-4 and IL-2 immunotherapy to suppress mela-
noma growth. These anti-tumor effects depended
on intratumorally accumulating interferon-g (IFN-g)-
producing PD-1low CD8+ T cells and PD-L1 downre-
gulation on melanoma cells. Hence, Ezh2 serves as
a molecular switch controlling melanoma escape
during T cell-targeting immunotherapies.
INTRODUCTION
The immune system plays a dual role during cancer elimination
versus progression. Immune cells recognize and eliminate malig-
nant cells via a process termed cancer immunosurveillance,
which relies on interferon-g (IFN-g) and tumor necrosis factor a
(TNF-a) production by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Schreiber et al.,
2011). However, these immune mechanisms also pressurize
tumor cells to initiate a dedifferentiation program associated
with loss of dominant tumor antigens and silencing of the anti-
gen-processing and presenting machinery (Ho
¨ lzel and T€
uting,
2016; Schreiber et al., 2011). In addition to these cell-intrinsic
modifications, extrinsic signals can contribute to cancer cell
resistance. Thus, various factors are able to promote an immu-
nosuppressive tumor microenvironment, including certain cyto-
kines,
chemokines,
enzymes,
and
negative
costimulatory
molecules, as well as CD4+ CD25+ forkhead boxP3 (FoxP3)+
regulatory T (Treg) cells and CD11b+ Gr-1+ myeloid-derived sup-
pressor cells (MDSCs).
Anti-tumor effector T cells facing antigen persistence upregu-
late PD-1 and become exhausted when encountering PD-L1-
expressing tumor cells, thus progressively losing their effector
functions, including IFN-g production (Wherry and Kurachi,
2015). Accordingly, immune checkpoint molecules, including
PD-1 and its ligand, PD-L1, contribute to an immunosuppressive
tumor microenvironment (Schreiber et al., 2011; Topalian et al.,
2015; Tumeh et al., 2014). Therapies targeting PD-1, PD-L1,
and
CTLA-4,
also
termed
immune
checkpoint
inhibitors,
increase the anti-tumor T cell response and have shown some
considerable anti-tumor effects in patients with metastatic
cancer, particularly melanoma (Larkin et al., 2015; Topalian
et al., 2015). However, despite these treatments, many cancer
patients experience progression of their disease, probably indi-
cating that tumor cells resort to resistance strategies when
facing heightened immune pressure. The molecular pathways
determining tumor escape from immunotherapy remain poorly
understood.
To study the molecular mechanisms of resistance to anti-
cancer treatment, we chose to use two different modes of immu-
notherapy in three mouse models of melanoma. Interleukin-2
(IL-2) immunotherapy is approved for metastatic melanoma
(Rosenberg, 2014) and has the advantage of stimulating anti-
cancer T cell responses independently of PD-1, PD-L1, and
CTLA-4 expression. We and others have been studying IL-2
and improved IL-2 formulations, including IL-2/anti-IL-2 mono-
clonal antibody (mAb) complexes (IL-2cx), in various preclinical
and clinical settings of metastatic melanoma (Arenas-Ramirez
et al., 2015). In preclinical studies, IL-2cx, but not free IL-2 or
anti-IL-2 mAb (Boyman et al., 2006), exerted vigorous anti-tumor
immune responses against syngeneic B16-F10 melanoma and
other cancers in mice (Arenas-Ramirez et al., 2016; Krieg et al.,

 2010; Levin et al., 2012). However, despite continuous treatment
with IL-2cx, B16-F10 melanoma nodules ultimately grew out in
most animals, suggesting subversion of immune-mediated
tumor control.
In human melanoma, genetic determinants of immune resis-
tance remain elusive, whereas transcriptomic alterations appear
to be a major feature of immune evasion (Hugo et al., 2016; Van
Allen et al., 2015). We thus hypothesized that immune pressure-
induced epigenetic rewiring of the transcriptional landscape
might drive immune resistance in melanoma cells. The polycomb
repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a prominent chromatin-remodel-
ing complex that mediates transcriptional repression via trime-
thylation of lysine 27 in histone 3 (H3K27me3). PRC2 consists of
embryonic ectoderm development (EED), suppressor of zeste 12
(SUZ12), and the histone methyltransferase unit EZH2, among
others (Kim and Roberts, 2016). Here, we show that Ezh2 con-
trols crucial melanoma cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms
of immune resistance to immunotherapy.
RESULTS
T Cell Infiltrates Correlate with PRC2 Subunit
Upregulation in Melanoma
Comparison of CD8+ T cell-associated genes (Bindea et al.,
2013) with epigenetic modifier genes within The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) human skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) RNA-
sequencing (RNA-seq) data (Cancer Genome Atlas Network,
2015) revealed a strong positive correlation of CD8+ T cell genes
with PRC2 complex members EED, SUZ12, EZH2, and EZH1, as
well as with HDAC1 and SETD2 (Figure 1A). Conversely, PRC1
members and all other tested epigenetic modifier genes did
not correlate positively with CD8+ T cell genes. These data
suggested that intratumoral CD8+ T cell accumulation might
promote PRC2 upregulation in melanoma.
To functionally investigate this hypothesis, we used two trans-
plantable and one spontaneous melanoma model. (1) The highly
proliferative B16-F10 murine melanoma cell line becomes visible
and palpable 3–4 days after cutaneous injection to syngeneic
C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice, and, after day 4, is difficult to
control by IL-2cx immunotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibi-
tors (Arenas-Ramirez et al., 2016; Krieg et al., 2010; Ueha
et al., 2015). (2) RIM-3 melanoma cells are derived from a primary
tumor from Tyr::NrasQ61K Cdkn2a (p16Ink4a)-deficient (hereafter
termed NrasQ61K Ink4a�/�) transgenic mice on a C57BL/6 back-
ground and display slower growth kinetics than B16-F10 upon
transplantation (Zingg et al., 2015). (3) NrasQ61K Ink4a�/� mice
spontaneously develop primary skin melanomas at 5–7 months
of age (Shakhova et al., 2012; Zingg et al., 2015). Similar to
B16-F10, IL-2cx delays but does not prevent melanoma in
NrasQ61K Ink4a�/� animals (Arenas-Ramirez et al., 2016).
In all three melanoma models, immunotherapy by IL-2cx or
anti-CTLA-4 mAb caused an increase in mRNA expression of
the PRC2 members Eed, Ezh2, and Suz12 (Figures 1B–1G).
In contrast, expression of Ezh1 and further key epigenetic
modifiers were not changed by immunotherapy. Notably, in
B16-F10 and RIM-3 tumor areas infiltrated by CD45+ leukocytes,
higher Ezh2 levels were found in comparison to areas with little
immune cell infiltrates (Figures 1H–1J), in agreement with the
TCGA-SKCM data (Figure 1A).
In comparison to WT mice, in animals deficient in recombi-
nase-activating gene 1 (Rag1�/�; thus devoid of T and B cells)
or in mice lacking both T cell receptor (TCR) ab+ and TCRgd+
T cells (Tcrbd�/�), IL-2cx immunotherapy failed to upregulate
PRC2, particularly Ezh2, at the mRNA and protein levels (Figures
1K, 1L, S1A, and S1B). Moreover, IL-2cx or anti-CTLA-4 treat-
ment of B16-F10 or RIM-3 cells in vitro did not cause any signif-
icant upregulation of PRC2 (Figure S1C). Together, these data
suggest that tumor-infiltrating T cells promote PRC2 upregula-
tion in both human and mouse melanoma.
Ezh2 Promotes Melanoma Dedifferentiation and Loss of
Immunogenicity
We next investigated whether immunotherapy-induced increase
in Ezh2 resulted in enhanced Ezh2 activity. Indeed, IL-2cx or
anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy resulted in increased Ezh2 protein
levels in B16-F10 and RIM-3 melanomas, which was accompa-
nied by a global increase in H3K27me3 (Figures 2A–2C and S2A–
S2E). Of note, upon immunotherapy, H3K27me3 levels did not
increase in B16-F10 tumors from Rag1�/� or Tcrbd�/� mice (Fig-
ures S1A and S1B). To study the molecular consequences
of enhanced Ezh2 activity in melanoma cells, we sought to iden-
tify potential Ezh2 target genes (ETGs) associated with tumor
cell immunogenicity. Immunotherapy of B16-F10 or RIM-3-
harboring animals led to transcriptional silencing of a variety of

 genes, including members of major histocompatibility complex
class I (MHC-I) molecules, antigen processing machinery, immu-
noproteasome, and several chemokines (Figures 2D and S2F).
Furthermore, a set of melanocyte lineage genes (Denecker
et al., 2014; Shakhova et al., 2012) was downregulated, some
of which constitute known melanoma antigens (Dct and Pmel,
also known as Trp2 and gp100). In contrast, expression of genes
previously connected to melanoma dedifferentiation and epithe-
lial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Caramel et al., 2013; Ho
¨ lzel
and T€
uting, 2016; Shakhova et al., 2012) substantially increased
upon immunotherapy (Figures 2D and S2F). Next, we addressed
whether transcriptionally silenced genes were direct Ezh2
targets by performing chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
for Ezh2 and H3K27me3. Indeed, in many of the promoter
regions of silenced genes, we detected enrichment for Ezh2
and H3K27me3 upon immunotherapies (Figures 2E, S2G, and
S2H). Importantly, changes in gene expression were most
apparent in tumor areas rich in immune cell infiltrates, as exem-
plified by Pmel and Mitf downregulation and Zeb1 upregulation
(Figures 2F, 2G, and S3A–S3D).
Ezh2 Inactivation Restores Melanoma Immunogenicity
To demonstrate that immunotherapy-induced gene expression
changes were dependent on Ezh2, we inhibited Ezh2 function
using either a short hairpin RNA against Ezh2 (shEzh2) or
GSK503, a specific chemical inhibitor of Ezh2 (Be
´ guelin et al.,
2013). RNAi by shEzh2 effectively reduced Ezh2 levels in vivo
and in vitro (Figures 2B, S2A, and S2B), while both RNAi and
GSK503 led to a considerable loss of H3K27me3 in melanoma
samples, even in animals receiving immunotherapy (Figures 2C
and S2A–S2E). Importantly, upon Ezh2 silencing, loss of Ezh2
and H3K27me3 was observed specifically in promoter regions
of aforementioned ETGs downregulated upon immunotherapy
(Figures 2E, S2G, and S2H). Accordingly, Ezh2 inactivation in
B16-F10 and RIM-3 promoted upregulation of these ETGs,
which was accompanied by suppression of dedifferentiation
genes (Figures 2D and S2F). This was most conspicuous for
tumor areas rich in CD45+ immune cell infiltrates (Figures 2F,
2G, and S3A–S3D).
Ezh2 Inactivation Synergizes with Anti-melanoma
Immunotherapy
Our data suggested that Ezh2 inactivation was sufficient to
reverse immunotherapy-induced immune resistance in mela-
noma. Indeed, compared to their monotherapies, a combination
of IL-2cx and Ezh2 RNAi or anti-CTLA-4 and Ezh2 RNAi signifi-
cantly delayed tumor growth, reducing tumor volume by over
75%
(Figures
3A–3C).
Similar
effects
were
observed
in
mice harboring B16-F10 following administration of GSK503
combined with immunotherapy (Figures 3D–3F). Strikingly,
co-administration of GSK503 and immunotherapy was also
very efficient in NrasQ61K Ink4a�/� animals when treated at devel-
oping primary melanomas (Figure 3G). While the monotherapies
showed some anti-tumor effects over PBS, the combination
treatments were highly efficient in causing melanoma regression
(Figure 3H). Consequently, at the time point of sacrifice, skin
melanoma volumes and counts in mice receiving combination
therapies were significantly reduced in comparison to mono-
therapies (Figures 3H, 3I, and S3E), resulting in prolonged skin-
melanoma-specific survival (Figure 3J). However, in mice with
LLC1 Lewis lung carcinoma or MC-38 murine colon carcinoma,
GSK503 + IL-2cx did not provide any advantage over IL-2cx (Fig-
ures S3F and S3G), which correlated with the tumors’ weak or
absent upregulation of PRC2 members (Figure S3H).
Combination Therapy Stimulates CD8+ T Cells and
Suppresses the PD-1/PD-L1 Axis
To assess the mechanism of action of immunotherapy combined
with Ezh2 inhibition, we analyzed tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
(TILs) in comparison to lymphocytes in tumor-draining lymph
nodes (TDLNs). Compared to control or GSK503 alone, immuno-
therapy, more notably GSK503 + IL-2cx immunotherapy, led to
increased CD8+ T cell counts in TILs and TDLNs (Figures 4A
and 4B). The difference in CD8+ TILs between IL-2cx and
GSK503 + IL-2cx was not due to increased systemic proliferation
and accumulation of CD8+ T cells during GSK503 + IL-2cx immu-
notherapy (Figures S4A and S4B). Although percentages of
CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ Treg cells were increased in TDLNs, Treg
cell counts in TDLNs and TILs were not significantly different
between treatment groups (Figures 4A and 4B). This resulted in
a ratio of CD8+ T cells to Treg cells of 15 in TILs and 13 in TDLNs
for GSK503 + IL-2cx immunotherapy, hence favoring intratumoral
CD8+ T cells with combination therapy (Figure 4C). Contrarily,
total CD4+ T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, MHC-II+ B and
antigen-presenting cells, and CD11b+ Gr-1+ MDSCs were not
significantly changed in TILs upon treatment, although some
differences were noted in TDLNs (Figures 4A, 4B, and S4C–
S4H). Similar effects on CD8+ T and Treg cells were obtained
using shEzh2 B16-F10 instead of GSK503 or with anti-CTLA-4
immunotherapy instead of IL-2cx (Figures S5A–S5D).
Phenotypic and functional analysis of TILs demonstrated that
CD8+ T cells in animals receiving GSK503 + IL-2cx were mainly

 CD44high CD62Lvariable CD69low with low expression of PD-1 and
of other immune checkpoint molecules, such as T cell immuno-
globulin and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3) and lymphocyte activation
gene-3 (LAG-3) (Figures 4D, 4E, S5E, and S5F). This suggested
Ezh2 inhibition plus IL-2cx immunotherapy prevented intratu-
moral accumulation of exhausted CD8+ T cells.
Furthermore, immunotherapy promoted PD-L1 upregulation in
melanomas (Figures 4F, 4G, and S5G). Thus, Pax3+ melanoma
cells increased PD-L1 upon IL-2cx treatment, particularly in
areas rich in CD3+ TILs (Figures 4F and 4G). This was consistent
with the observed increase of Zeb1 upon immunotherapy (Fig-
ures S3C and S3D), which has been shown to enhance PD-L1
expression (Chen et al., 2014). Ezh2 inactivation, however, led
to reduced PD-L1 mRNA levels and a decrease in PD-L1+
Pax3+ melanoma cells, which was maintained during concomi-
tant IL-2cx or anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy (Figures 4F, 4G,
S5G, and S5H). Downregulation of the immunosuppressive
PD-1/PD-L1 axis by Ezh2 blockade plus IL-2cx combination
therapy was remarkably efficient, even when treatment was
initiated only after formation of visible tumor nodules, while addi-
tion of a blocking anti-PD-1 mAb was unable to further improve
the anti-tumor effects of GSK503 (Figure 4H). Thus, immuno-
therapy combined with Ezh2 blockade results in the accumula-
tion of non-exhausted effector CD8+ T cells within TILs and
inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis.
Combination Immunotherapy Depends on Migrating
IFN-g+ CD8+ T Cells
The demonstration in animals receiving Ezh2 inhibitor plus
immunotherapy that CD8+ T cells predominated TILs and
expressed low PD-1 levels suggested that tumor control
depended on these cells. We thus compared combination ther-
apy using GSK503 + IL-2cx in WT animals versus Rag1�/� or
Tcrbd�/� mice that lack T cells (and also B cells in the case of
Rag1�/�) but harbor functional NK cells. The anti-melanoma
effect of combination therapy was lost in both Tcrbd�/� and
Rag1�/� mice (Figure 5A), thus demonstrating that T cells, but
not B or NK cells, exerted the tumoricidal effects. Further exper-
iments using specific depleting mAbs showed that CD8+, but
not CD4+ T cells, played a crucial role in the anti-tumor response.
Thus, during GSK503 + IL-2cx treatment, tumor control was lost
in animals injected with anti-CD8 mAb, while mice receiving anti-
CD4 mAb were able to suppress tumor growth (Figure 5B).
The anti-tumor effect of GSK503 + IL-2cx depended on IFN-g
production, as demonstrated using Ifng�/� mice (Figure 5C). In
line with these data, high numbers of both CD90.1� polyclonal
CD8+ (Figure 5D) and, upon adoptive transfer, CD90.1+ Pmel-
specific TCR-transgenic CD8+ T cells (Figure 5E) produced
IFN-g when isolated from TDLNs of mice receiving IL-2cx or
GSK503 + IL-2cx combination therapy, whereas IFN-g-produc-
ing cells were significantly lower in the other groups (Figures 5D
and 5E). Also, ex vivo cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T cells, as
assessed by using the degranulation marker CD107a, was
highest following combination immunotherapy, as shown by
higher numbers of CD107a+ CD8+ T cells within TILs from
animals treated with Ezh2 blockade plus IL-2cx (Figure 5F).
In line with our observation that Ezh2 inactivation plus immu-
notherapy favored intratumoral accumulation of CD8+ T cells
rather than their proliferation systemically or in TDLNs (Figures
4B, S4A, and S5I), intratumoral expression of the T cell-attractant
chemokines Cxcl9 and Cxcl10 increased upon Ezh2 inactivation
(Figure 5G). In contrast, monoimmunotherapies resulted in
PRC2-mediated silencing of Cxcl9 and Cxcl10 (Figures 2D, 2E,
5G, S2F, and S2H). Accordingly, targeting of CXCR3, the recep-
tor of the aforementioned chemokines, significantly reduced the
anti-tumor effect of GSK503 + IL-2cx (Figure 5H).
TNF-a-Producing T Cells Cause PRC2-Mediated
Melanoma Immune Resistance
Based on our findings, we reasoned that soluble factors released
by the immune infiltrate might promote PRC2 gain of function in
melanoma. To test this hypothesis, we applied a panel of growth
factors and chemokines to B16-F10 and RIM-3 in vitro cultures.
This screen revealed TNF-a to be the strongest factor in inducing
upregulation of PRC2 subunits, whereas other prototypic pro-
inflammatory cytokines only minimally upregulated or, in the
case of IFN-g, even downregulated PRC2 members (Figure 6A).
In contrast to IFN-g, inflammation and particularly production of
TNF-a have previously been shown to promote melanoma dedif-
ferentiation and tumor immune escape (Ho

uting, 2016).
Thus, we further investigated the relevance of TNF-a in PRC2-
dependent melanoma immune evasion. TNF-a stimulation of
B16-F10 cells induced Ezh2 expression and, consequently, led
to increased H3K27me3 levels (Figures 6B, 6C, and S6A). More-
over, exposure of B16-F10 and RIM-3 cells to TNF-a resulted
in silencing of several antigen processing, presentation, and
melanocyte lineage genes, as well as Cxcl9 and Cxcl10, in an
Ezh2-dependent fashion (Figures 6D and S6B). This process
inversely correlated with enrichment of H3K27me3 in the pro-
moter regions of these genes (Figures 6E and S6C).
The TNF-a- and Ezh2-dependent transcriptional changes
appeared comparable to the gene expression changes observed
in tumors upon immunotherapies (Figures 2 and S2). Interest-
ingly, B16-F10 and RIM-3 tumor lysates showed increased
expression of Tnf mRNA and TNF-a protein when derived from
animals receiving immunotherapy (Figures 6F and 6G). Similarly,
Tnf expression was increased in tumors from NrasQ61K Ink4a�/�
mice treated with immunotherapy (Figure 6H). Tnf expression
and TNF-a concentration in tumor nodules depended on the
presence of T cells, as demonstrated using Rag1�/� and
Tcrbd�/� mice (Figures 6I and 6J). Furthermore, Tnf transcripts
were nearly absent in B16-F10 tumors from Tnf�/� animals,
suggesting that TNF-a was mostly released by host-derived cells
rather than tumor cells (Figure 6K). Importantly, IL-2cx immuno-
therapy failed to upregulate PRC2 subunits, including Ezh2, in
Tnf�/� mice (Figure 6L).
DISCUSSION
To better understand tumor resistance to immunotherapy, we
investigated the role of the epigenetic modifier Ezh2 during
anti-CTLA-4 and IL-2 treatment in models of aggressive mela-
noma. Our data demonstrate that immunotherapy led to
increased Ezh2 activity that was dependent on T cells and
TNF-a, resulting in melanoma dedifferentiation, loss of immuno-
genicity, and upregulation of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. These

 findings fit and extend previous reports of immunotherapy using
adoptive T cell transfer or activating T cells resulting in TNF-a-
dependent melanoma dedifferentiation and PD-L1 upregulation
(Ho
¨ lzel and T€
uting, 2016; Spranger et al., 2013). Moreover,
increased expression of the melanoma dedifferentiation gene
Zeb1, as seen here upon immunotherapy, has been associated
with enhanced PD-L1 expression (Chen et al., 2014; Wang
et al., 2014).
However, these changes proved to be dynamic and malleable,
in that inhibition of Ezh2 restored presentation of several
dominant melanoma antigens while downregulating PD-L1 on
melanoma cells. In parallel, PD-1 expression on tumor-antigen-
specific and polyclonal melanoma-infiltrating CD8+ T cells
decreased significantly, thus improving effector functions of
the cells, including IFN-g production and cytotoxicity. The net
result of these effects was control of melanoma growth and, in
the case of NrasQ61K Ink4a�/� mice, tumor regression, which
clearly exceeded the efficacy of monotherapies consisting of
IL-2cx, anti-CTLA-4, or Ezh2 inhibition (Arenas-Ramirez et al.,
2016; Krieg et al., 2010; Ueha et al., 2015; Zingg et al., 2015).
Unlike melanoma, mice carrying LLC1 Lewis lung carcinoma or
MC-38 murine colon carcinoma showed barely any upregulation
of Ezh2 upon immunotherapy. Consequently, these cancer
models did not benefit from the addition of Ezh2 blockade to
immunotherapy, pointing to a melanoma-specific role of PRC2
in governing immune evasion.
Recent reports suggested a somewhat antagonistic role of
PRC2 in the anti-tumor immune response (Peng et al., 2015;
Zhao et al., 2016). In ovarian and colon cancer cells, PRC2
was able to repress CD8+ T cell trafficking to the tumor site
(Nagarsheth et al., 2016; Peng et al., 2015). Consistent with these
data we found that upon Ezh2 inactivation, effector CD8+ T cells
preferentially accumulated intratumorally in a CXCL9/CXCL10-
CXCR3-dependent fashion. Moreover, we complement these
findings by demonstrating that T cell- and TNF-a-dependent
Ezh2 upregulation is implicated in several other immune escape
mechanisms, namely melanoma dedifferentiation, tumor cell
immunogenicity, and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Thus, Ezh2 inactiva-
tion locks melanoma cells in an immunogenic state and facili-
tates efficient CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor responses during
immunotherapy. However, Ezh2 has also been shown to affect
T cells directly by improving survival and activity of anti-tumor
CD8+ T cells (Zhao et al., 2016) and maintaining Foxp3+ Treg
cells (DuPage et al., 2015). In our study, however, melanoma
cell-specific Ezh2 RNAi led to similar effects as systemic Ezh2
blockade. Furthermore, despite systemic Ezh2 inhibition, we
did not find any evidence for compromised CD8+ T cell function
in our melanoma models, while Foxp3+ Treg cells failed to accu-
mulate within TILs. Hence, this discrepancy might be due to the
tumor models or immunotherapies used in the different studies.
HighEZH2expressionis associated with unfavorable prognosis
in human cutaneous melanoma, and Ezh2 inactivation antago-
nizes metastatic progression in murine melanoma models (Mann-
ing et al., 2015; Zingg et al., 2015). Moreover, in several cancers,
tumor stemness and EMT have been linked to immune evasion
(Ho
¨ lzel and T€
uting, 2016; Lou et al., 2016; Tripathi et al., 2016).
Finally, tumor biopsy specimens from cutaneous melanoma pa-
tients displaying resistance to checkpoint blockade therapy
showed increased expression of melanoma dedifferentiation
genes in favor of melanocyte lineage genes (Hugo et al., 2016).
Hence, melanoma might similarly take advantage of PRC2 activity
to promote EMT, resulting in resistance to immune pressure
during T cell-engaging immunotherapy and ultimately metastasis.
Despite some long-term responders, a notable number of
melanoma patients are intrinsically resistant to PD-1/PD-L1
checkpoint blockade, for instance due to a paucity of PD-1+
TILs or of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells (Herbst et al., 2014;
Hugo et al., 2016; Tumeh et al., 2014; Van Allen et al., 2015).
Since blockade of Ezh2 is associated with downregulation of
the PD-1/PD-L1 axis and, therefore, independent of PD-1 and
PD-L1 expression levels in patients, the combination therapies
presented here might offer an alternative strategy for patients
resistant to anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 treatment.
EZH2 inhibitors are currently tested in several clinical trials in
solid and hematological malignancies with the aim of exerting
an antiproliferative effect on the cancer cells (Kim and Roberts,
2016). Our data suggest that subtoxic doses of EZH2 inhibitors
might suffice to prevent cancer immune resistance during immu-
notherapy. Hence, targeting of EZH2 is an attractive strategy to
combine with cancer immunotherapy.

 et al., 2016). Skin-melanoma-specific survival of NrasQ61K Ink4a�/� mice was
considered melanoma independent (censored event), when at the time point
of sacrifice more than 50% of skin melanomas showed a tumor volume reduc-
tion greater than 50%. Animal experiments were approved by the veterinary
authorities of Canton of Zurich, Switzerland, and were performed in accor-
dance with Swiss law and GlaxoSmithKline policy on the Care, Welfare, and
Treatment of Animals. Pre-established exclusion criteria were based on the
Canton of Zurich veterinary authority’s guidelines and included substantial
weight loss of Dm >15% of initial body weight.
Cell Cultures
The murine B16-F10 (CRL-6475, ATCC), LLC1, and MC-38 (provided by
R. Schwendener) cell lines were cultured in growth medium. RIM-3 skin mela-
noma cells derived from a NrasQ61K Ink4a�/� mouse on a pure C57BL/6 back-
ground (Zingg et al., 2015) were cultured on plates coated with fibronectin
(F1141, Sigma-Aldrich) using melanocyte medium, which was DMEM/F-12
(21041, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
(FCS), penicillin-streptomycin, and 200 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
(PMA; P1585, Sigma-Aldrich).
Adoptive Tumor Models
Recipient mice were intradermally or subcutaneously engrafted with either
500,000 RIM-3 cells or 1 3 106 B16-F10, LLC1, or MC-38 cells. Mice were
sacrificed either at indicated time points or upon reaching a maximal tumor
volume of V = 2,000 mm3.
In Vivo Treatments
Recombinant human IL-2 (Teceleukin, Roche), anti-CTLA-4 mAb (a-CTLA-4,
9D9, BioXcell), anti-PD-1 mAb (a-PD-1, RMP1-14, BioXcell), anti-CXCR-3
(a-CXCR-3, CXCR3-173, BioXcell), isotype control (iso-Co, C1.18.4, BioXcell),
and GSK503 (GlaxoSmithKline) were purchased. IL-2cx was prepared by
mixing IL-2 and anti-IL-2 mAb NARA1 as described previously (Arenas-Ram-
irez et al., 2016). GSK503 was diluted (15 mg/mL) in 20% Captisol solution
(Ligand Pharmaceuticals). Treatment of B16-F10-engrafted mice began
when tumors became visible (at approximately day 4). Treatment of RIM-
3-engrafted mice was initiated when tumors reached a size of V > 150 mm3
(at about 20 days). Treatment of NrasQ61K Ink4a�/� mice was started when at
least one skin melanoma reached a diameter of >2 mm (at about 5–7 months).
Ezh2 inhibition was achieved by daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of
150 mg/kg GSK503 for B16-F10 and RIM-3 and 75 mg/kg GSK503 for LLC1
and MC-38 until termination of the experiment. Where indicated, mice
harboring B16-F10 received i.p. injections of IL-2cx (1.5 mg hIL-2/15 mg
NARA1), or 250 mg a-CTLA-4 for 4 consecutive days, while LLC1 or MC-38-
bearing animals received three weekly cycles consisting of IL-2cx (1.0 mg
hIL-2/10 mg NARA1) injections for 4 consecutive days. Mice bearing RIM-3
received i.p. injections of IL-2cx (1.5 mg hIL-2/15 mg NARA1) or 250 mg
a-PD-1 every other day until termination of the experiment. For NrasQ61K
Ink4a�/� mice, 150 mg/kg GSK503 and, where indicated, IL-2cx (1.0 mg hIL-
2/10 mg NARA1) or 167 mg a-CTLA-4 was applied i.p. three times a week until
termination of the experiment. Where mentioned, depletion of CD4+ cells was
performed using 250 mg anti-CD4 mAb (a-CD4, clone GK1.5, BioXcell), CD8+
cells using 500 mg anti-CD8 mAb (a-CD8, clone YTS169, BioXcell), and
CXCR3 using 500 mg a-CXCR3 mAb. Depleting mAbs were administered i.p.
every other day (a-CD4 and a-CD8) or every 3 days (a-CXCR3) starting on
day 0 of tumor implantation until the end of the experiment. Where indicated,
CD90.1+ Pmel-specific CD8+ T cells were obtained as established previously
(Arenas-Ramirez et al., 2016) from PmelSi Thy1a transgenic mice. At least
2 3 106 purified and carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Thermo
Fisher Scientific)-labeled CD8+ T cells were adoptively transferred to recipi-
ents. Cell proliferation was measured using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU;
B5002, Sigma-Aldrich) as described previously (Arenas-Ramirez et al., 2016).
Flow Cytometry
Single-cell suspensions of lymph nodes, spleen, and tumors were pre-
pared and stained as previously described (Arenas-Ramirez et al., 2016).
Fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies are listed in Table S1. Intracellular
CD107a, FoxP3, and IFN-g staining was performed following the manufac-
turers’ instructions after in vitro restimulation using PMA and ionomycin
(0.1 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL, P8139 and I0634, Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence
of brefeldin A and monensin (2 mg/mL, B7651 and M5273, Sigma-Aldrich).
Samples were acquired with a BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences)
and analyzed using FlowJo software.
Histological Analysis and Immunofluorescence
For immunofluorescence staining, mouse tumor samples were processed and
stained as established (O’Connell et al., 2013; Zingg et al., 2015) using primary
and secondary antibodies (Tables S2 and S3). Sections were recorded using a
DMI 6000B microscope (Leica). Images were processed by Photoshop CS5
software (Adobe) to exclude areas covered by CD45 or CD3 staining. To
measure cytoplasmic Pmel labeling, brightness of the Pmel signal was
measured with CellProfiler software (Carpenter et al., 2006) (MeasureImageIn-
tensity). To measure nuclear staining (Ezh2, Mitf, Zeb1), algorithms in
CellProfiler identifying nuclei (IdentifyPrimaryObjects) and quantifying nuclear
intensities (MeasureObjectIntensity) were applied. CD45+ or Pax3+ PD-L1+
cells were counted manually. For each tumor, at least ten fields containing
either n < 5 or n > 20 CD45+ or CD3+ cells were quantified.
In Vitro Silencing and Inhibition of Ezh2
To stably silence Ezh2, B16-F10 cells were transfected with small hairpin
RNA (shRNA)-expressing plasmids encoding either a scrambled shRNA
(shCo; SHC002, Sigma-Aldrich) or Ezh2 mRNA-targeting shRNA (shEzh2;
TRCN0000039040, Sigma-Aldrich). 10 mg plasmid was applied in combination
with jetPEI DNA Transfection Reagent (101-10N, Polyplus Transfection)
according
to
the
manufacturer’s
recommendations.
Transfected
cells
were selected using 1 mg/mL puromycin (A11138-02, Life Technologies) for
1 week before further assessment. To pharmacologically inhibit Ezh2, cells
were treated with 1 mM GSK503 for 8 days before further assessment. Effi-
ciency of shEzh2 and GSK503 has been validated previously (Zingg et al.,
2015).
In Vitro Growth Factor and Chemokine Treatments
Growth factors and chemokines indicated in Table S4 were resolved in 0.1%
BSA in PBS. Cells were grown in starvation medium (1% FCS) for 48 hr and
subsequently treated with growth factors and chemokines, 1000 U/mL

 IL-2cx or 16.7 mg/mL a-CTLA-4 for 48 hr in starvation medium before further
assessment.
RNA Isolation and qRT-PCR
Cultured cells were lysed in Buffer RLT (79216, QIAGEN) containing 1%
2-mercaptoethanol, while tumor nodules were homogenized in the same
buffer using a Polytron PT 2100 tissue disperser (Kinematica). Subsequent
RNA extraction and DNase treatment of samples was performed using the
RNeasy Mini Kit (74104, QIAGEN) and RNase-Free DNase Set (79254,
QIAGEN) according to manufacturer’s guidelines. Purified RNA was sub-
jected to reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction using the Maxima First Strand
cDNA Synthesis Kit (K1641, Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by an RNase
H (EN0202, Thermo Fisher Scientific) digestion step according to the manufac-
turer’s recommendations. Real-time qPCR (qPCR) was performed on a
LightCycler 480 System (Roche) using LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master
(4707516001, Roche). qRT-PCR primers are listed in Table S5. Relative quan-
tified RNA was normalized using Usf1 as housekeeping transcript.
Chromatin Isolation and ChIP
Chromatin isolation and ChIP of cultured cells and tumor nodules was
performed according to the manufacturer’s guidelines using the SimpleChIP
Plus Enzymatic Chromatin IP Kit (9005, Cell Signaling Technology). Briefly,
107 cultured cells were crosslinked on culture plates and subjected to
chromatin isolation, while tumor samples of 150 mg were minced using
scissors prior to crosslinking. Crosslinked samples were disaggregated into
single cells using a Polytron PT 2100 tissue disperser. Isolated nuclei were
digested with 5 mL micrococcal nuclease for 30 min at 37�C, and nuclei
were lysed using a SONOPULS HD 2070 Ultrasonic Homogenizer (Bandelin).
ChIP was performed with 18 mg chromatin and the primary antibodies listed in
Table S2. qPCR was performed on a LightCycler 480 System using the KAPA
SYBR Fast qPCR Kit Master Mix (KR0389, KAPA Biosystems). Primers were
specified to amplify genomic DNA from a region flanking the transcriptional
starting site �500 bp to +100 bp devoid of local CpG islands, and are indicated
in Table S6. Relative promoter enrichment was normalized to chromatin
inputs, and the intergenic region 1 (Interg1) was used as negative control.
Protein Isolation and Western Blotting
Protein lysates of cultured cells and tumor nodules were isolated and western
blots performed as described previously (Zingg et al., 2015). Briefly, SDS-
PAGE was carried out on 4%–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Gels (456-1094,
Bio-Rad). Primary antibodies (Table S2) were applied in Odyssey blocking
buffer (927-40000, LI-COR Biosciences) overnight at 4�C and visualized using
secondary antibodies (Table S3) in Odyssey blocking buffer for 45 min at room
temperature. Blots were scanned and quantified with an Odyssey imaging
system (LI-COR Biosciences). Quantified band intensities were normalized
using either b-actin or histone 3 as housekeeping protein.
ELISA
4 mg/mL protein lysate isolated as for western blotting was subjected to the
Mouse TNF-alpha Quantikine ELISA Kit (MTA00B, R&D Systems) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Optical density was measured using a DTX
880 Multimode Detector (Beckman Coulter) at 450 nm.
Gene Expression Correlation Analyses
The RNA-seq dataset for SKCM was downloaded from TCGA data portal (Can-
cer Genome Atlas Network, 2015). RSEM normalized RNA-seq reads were
used for differential RNA expression analysis using R software. Genes indica-
tive of presence of intratumoral CD8+ T cells have previously been defined
(Bindea et al., 2013). Within the TCGA-SKCM RNA-seq dataset, expression
of each of these CD8+ T cell signature genes was correlated to the expression
of epigenetic modifier genes. Significance of correlative gene expression was
calculated by using Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient (r).
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism 6. p values were
calculated with a two-sided unpaired Student’s t test or, for comparison of
more than two groups, ANOVA and Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD)
or Bonferroni correction. p values for comparison of Kaplan-Meier curves
were calculated with the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. The expected variance
was similar between groups. For all analyses, significance was accepted at
a 95% confidence level (p < 0.05).
