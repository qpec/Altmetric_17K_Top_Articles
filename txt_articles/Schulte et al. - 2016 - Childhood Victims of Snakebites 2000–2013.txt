abstract
BACKGROUND: Snakebites are not a reportable condition (to state health departments), and 1 
major assessment of US children with snakebites was published 50 years ago. Increasing 
urbanization, population shifts south and west, newer antivenom therapy, and the 
importation of exotic snakes may have changed snakebites. Poison control centers are often 
consulted on treatment and collect surveillance data.
METHODS: Generic codes for venomous, nonvenomous, and unknown snakebites were used to 
characterize victims aged ≤18 years reported to US poison control centers between 2000 
and 2013. Data included demographic characteristics, snake types, and outcomes.
RESULTS: Callers reported 18 721 pediatric snakebites (annual mean, 1337). Two-thirds 
were male (n = 12 688 [68%]), with a mean age of 10.7 years. One-half of the snakebites 
were venomous (n = 9183 [49%]), with copperheads (n = 3602 [39%]) and rattlesnakes 
(n = 2859 [31%]) the most frequently identified. Reported copperhead bites increased 137% 
and unknown crotalids (venomous) increased 107%. Exotic (nonnative) exposures were 
reported in 2% of cases. All 50 states reported snakebites, but one-quarter occurred in 
Texas and Florida. Rates for total snakebites and venomous snakebites were highest in West 
Virginia, Oklahoma, and Louisiana. One-fifth required ICU admission. Limited data for 28% 
of bites for antivenom treatment suggests increasing use. Four victims died.
CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiology of pediatric snakebites is changing. One-half of the reported 
exposures were venomous, and copperhead bites and exotic species are being reported 
more frequently. Although snakebite-related deaths are rare, ICU admission is common. 
Antivenom treatment is incompletely reported, but its use is increasing.

WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Few 
comprehensive assessments of pediatric snakebites 
have been published.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Reported snakebites 
average 1300 annually. One-half of the 18 721 
snakebites reported were venomous, and 2% 
involved exotic snakes. Antivenom treatment of bites 
from copperheads and unknown snake types has 
increased. About 20% required ICU admission, and 
4 deaths were reported.

Snakebites are not a reportable 
condition (to state health 
departments), and few 
comprehensive surveillance 
assessments exist. One often-
cited study assessing snakebites 
among US children was published 
in 1965 (50 years ago) and used data 
from individual hospitals in 
10 states. 
1 Since that date, increasing 
urbanization, population shifts to the 
southern and western states, 
 
2, 
 
3 
development of new antivenom 
treatments, 
 
4 and the emergence 
of exotic snakes as an industry5, 
 
6 
have altered the population and the 
circumstances in which snakebites 
may occur. Increasing numbers of US 
households are estimated to own a 
snake, 
 
5 which can lead to bites and 
even death. 
7, 
 
8
The main objective of the present 
study was to characterize snakebites 
to children and adolescents aged 
≤18 years reported to US poison 
control centers between 2000 and 
2013. We investigated the trends in, 
and epidemiologic characteristics of, 
pediatric snakebites and the resulting 
consequences, including hospital 
admissions and possible antivenom 
treatment.
METHODS
Data Sources
This study was based on data 
collected in the National Poison Data 
System (NPDS), which is maintained 
by the American Association of 
Poison Control Centers. Poison 
control centers offer 24-hour advice 
and consultation for individuals 
and hospitals using an 800 number, 
with calls routed on the basis of 
the caller’s area code. The collected 
documentation for each call includes 
exposure (in this study, type of 
snake), basic demographic data on 
the exposed person, subsequent 
medical information related to the 
exposure, and other information 
regarding the incident. 
9 US 
Census Bureau data were used to 
calculate population-based rates 
for total snakebites and venomous 
snakebites. 
10
Data Selection and Conditions
NPDS data were obtained for all 
single snakebite exposures among 
persons with a known age of ≤18 
years that were reported to any 
US poison control center between 
calendar years 2000 and 2013. 
9 
Cases were limited to those in which 
the victim was in or referred to a 
health care facility (HCF).
As a condition of obtaining the 
national data, we agreed not to 
contact any individual poison 
control center to request free text or 
charts at any poison control center. 
We were able to obtain the death 
abstracts of the 4 cases because such 
cases are forwarded to American 
Association of Poison Control Centers 
and are reviewed and published in 
annual reports.

Snakebite Variables
Snakebites are defined with NPDS 
generic codes 
9, 
 
11 identifying 
venomous, nonvenomous, and 
unknown snakes, both species 
indigenous to the United States 
and exotic varieties that are 
nonnative to the United States. 
9 
Specific codes for the domestic 
snakes are unknown types of snake 
envenomation (13700); unknown 
or known nonpoisonous snakebites 
(137102); rattlesnake envenomation 
(137103); coral snake envenomation 
(137104); copperhead envenomation 
(137106); cottonmouth/water 
moccasin envenomation (137107); 
and unknown crotalid envenomation 
(137105). Rattlesnakes, copperheads, 
and cottonmouths/water moccasin 
are all pit vipers and are classified as 
unknown crotalids if not specifically 
identified.
Codes for the exotic snakes, 
nonnative to the United States, 
include exotic snake poisonous 
(137108), exotic snake nonpoisonous 
(137109), and exotic snake unknown 
if poisonous (137110).
Antivenom Therapy
During the study period, antivenom 
therapy for domestic snakebites 
evolved. Before 2000, the major 
antivenom used for all domestic 
venomous snakes (except coral) was 
a polyvalent product of equine origin 
manufactured by Wyeth (US Food 
and Drug Administration, personal 
communication, 2016). The last lot 
of that antivenom expired in March 
2007, and it was generally only used 
in severe envenomations because 
it could produce serious adverse 
effects, including anaphylaxis and 
serum sickness. 
12, 
 
13 Concurrent 
use of epinephrine to treat possible 
anaphylaxis was common. A separate 
Wyeth antivenom, specific to coral 
snakes, had been available in 
limited supply with an expiration 
date of May 2016 (US Food and 
Drug Administration, personal 
communication, 2016).
The Fab antivenom that has become 
the therapeutic cornerstone for many 
US snakebites, including those to 
children, 
 
4 was granted approval by 
the US Food and Drug Administration 
in 2000. This Fab antivenom 
(CroFab [BTG International Inc, 
West Conshohocken, PA]) is derived 
from sheep and is considered less 
antigenic because it lacks the Fc 
antibody fragment. 
4, 
 
13 In this article, 
the newer antivenom is referred to 
as Fab antivenom. The older Wyeth 
antivenoms are called polyvalent 
antivenom and coral snake 
antivenom and, collectively, as older 
antivenoms.
Collected information on antivenoms 
is coded as recommended, 
performed, recommended and 
performed, and recommended, 
known not performed. We 
consolidated those categories into 
treated and any consideration of 
antivenom on use.

Defi
 nition of Treatable Envenomation
Most snakebites, whether venomous 
or not, will have some type of 
local tissue effect, including minor 
pain and erythema. Venomous 
snakebites may cause a variety of 
symptoms, including pain, swelling, 
tissue necrosis, low blood pressure, 
convulsions, hemorrhage, respiratory 
paralysis, kidney failure, coma, and 
death. 
1, 
 
3, 
 
9 However, not all venomous 
snakes are identified as such, and 
unknown snakes can be venomous 
but unrecognized.
The decision to treat a specific bite 
with antivenom is made by a treating 
provider, often in consultation with 
a poison control center. Antivenom 
treatment may be administered for 
victims bitten by known venomous 
snakes or bites in which an unknown 
snake type produces serious 
complications in the provider’s 
judgment.
A potentially treatable envenomation 
was defined as one in which a bitten 
patient was at risk for complications 
because the bite involved an 
identified domestic venomous snake 
or an unknown domestic snake 
(n = 15 422) ( 
Fig 1). The domestic 
venomous snakes considered 
included rattlesnakes, copperheads, 
cottonmouths, coral snakes, and 
unknown crotalids.
Other Variables
Geographic location is the state 
where the snakebite occurred. 
11 
Exposure site was collapsed to 
residence (either the child’s own 
home or another) versus all other 
sites. In NPDS, level of treatment 
at an HCF is categorized as seen at 
HCF, no HCF treatment, and patient 
refused referral/did not arrive at 
the HCF. The description of being 
seen at HCF includes admission to a 
critical care unit (ICU), admitted to 
a noncritical care unit (floor), being 
treated/evaluated, and released 
(<24-hour stay).
Additional variables analyzed 
included children’s sex, age, and 
month and year of exposure. 
11 
Exposure, case, and call were used as 
interchangeable terms.
Statistical Analysis and Ethical 
Considerations
SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc, 
Cary, NC) and Epi Info (Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, 
Atlanta, GA) were used for data 
analysis. The institutional review 
board at UT Southwestern approved 
this study.
RESULTS
Demographic Characteristics of 
Bitten Children and Adolescents
Poison control centers received 18 721 
reports of snakebites to children and 
adolescents aged ≤18 years during the 
study period. More than two-thirds 
of those bitten were male (n = 12 688 
[68%]), with a mean age of 10.7 years. 
Bite numbers were highest among 
children aged 3 to 9 years (n = 6717 
[36%]) and 10 to 14 years (n = 5917 
[32%]). Four deaths were reported.
Exposures were reported in all 
months, with one-third in June 
and July (n = 6461 [33%]). Most 
exposures were in residential home 
settings (n = 14 824 [89%]). Calls 
were distributed equally among the 
7 weekdays, and more than one-
quarter of calls (n = 5048 [27%]) 
were made between 7:00 and 
10:00 PM. Most patients (n = 14 980 
[80%]) were in an HCF when the 
poison control center was called.
Deaths
Four separate deaths of children 
were reported; 3 by rattlesnakes 
(Texas, Georgia, and Florida) and 
1 by an unknown type of snake 
(Florida). All deaths were considered 
directly related to the snakebites.
A 2-year-old girl who died in Texas 
in 2010 had 2 bites on her ankle; 
a rattlesnake was found at the 
lake where she visited. She had a 
generalized seizure before transport 
to a hospital 2 hours away where she 
was given 6 vials of Fab antivenom 
and admitted to the ICU. She was 
started on vasopressor agents but 
became hypotensive and pulseless. 
She died 5 hours after being bitten.
A 3-year-old boy was bitten in 
Georgia in 2000 by a rattlesnake, 
received 36 vials of polyvalent 
crotalid antivenom, and developed 
disseminated intravascular 
coagulopathy. He died within several 
hours of the envenomation.
In 2000, a 2-year-old boy from 
Florida was bitten on the knee by a 
rattlesnake and received 90 vials of 
polyvalent crotalid antivenom. He 
had only 1 fang mark and bled from 
a cutdown site, oral orifices, and the 
gastrointestinal tract. He received

vasopressor agents and transfusions 
but had had no response to pain 
within 24 hours and was declared 
brain dead.
A 17-year-old female, bitten on the 
right hand by an unknown type of 
snake in 2001 in Florida, was initially 
seen at a fire station. She was thought 
to be having an allergic reaction and 
given epinephrine. She had 2 puncture 
marks on her right hand, with no 
local swelling or ecchymosis. She had 
a seizure en route to the emergency 
department and became hypotensive. 
She was intubated, received a total of 
34 vials of Fab antivenom, and had no 
response to vasopressor agents. She 
died on day 5 of hospitalization.
Geographic Distribution of All 
Snakebites
An annual mean of 1337 snakebites 
were reported (range, 1184–1527). 
One-half of all the reported 
snakebites (domestic and exotic) 
were venomous (n = 9182 [49%]). 
Other totals were nonvenomous 
(n = 3156 [17%]) and unknown type 
of snake (n = 6382 [34%]). Among 
the venomous snakes, copperheads 
(n = 3602 [39%]) and rattlesnakes 
(n = 2859 [31%]) were most common. 
Lower numbers were reported for 
unknown crotalids (n = 1853 [20%]), 
cottonmouths (n = 511 [6%]), coral 
snakes (n = 232 [3%]), and exotic 
venomous snakes (n = 126 [1%]).
Snakebites were reported in 50 
states, Washington, DC, and Puerto 
Rico, but 39% (n = 7238) were 
reported by 4 states: Texas (n = 2627 
[14%]), Florida (n = 2199 [12%]), 
Georgia (n = 1237 [7%]), and North 
Carolina (n = 1174 [6%]). Prevalence 
rates per 1 million population ( 
Fig 2) 
for all snakebites were highest in 
West Virginia (762.3), Louisiana 
(625.5), and Oklahoma (557.5).
Geographic Distribution of 
Venomous Snakebites
Venomous snakebites were reported 
in 48 states, Washington, DC, and 
Puerto Rico. Forty percent (n = 
3789) of snakebites were reported 
in 4 states: Texas (n = 1431 [16%]), 
Florida (n = 895 [10%]), North 
Carolina (n = 815 [9%]), and California 
(n = 648 [7%]). Texas and North 
Carolina reported one-third of the 
copperhead bites (n = 1203). Arizona 
and California reported 40% (n = 
1154) of the rattlesnake bites. Florida 
reported 60% of coral snake bites 
(n = 160) and 25% of cottonmouth 
bites (n = 124). Prevalence rates per 
1 million populations for venomous 
bites ( 
Fig 3) were highest in West 
Virginia (421.4), Oklahoma (383.2), 
and Louisiana (354).
Trends in Reported Snakebite 
Exposures and Antivenom Use
Use of any antivenom therapy was 
considered in 5279 (28%) reported 
snakebites and administered in 4817 
(25.7%) exposures. During the study 
period, Fab antivenom use increased 
298%, spiking after the last lot of 
polyvalent antivenom expired.

Figure 4 shows trends in reported 
exposures for domestic snakes 
(venomous and unknown) that might 
be treated with antivenom therapy 
(as discussed in the Definition of 
Treatable Envenomation section). 
Between 2000 and 2013, copperhead 
reports increased 137% and 
unknown crotalid reports increased 
107%.
 
Figures 5,  
6, and  
7 show trends in 
reported snakebites and antivenom 
use for rattlesnake, copperhead, 
and unknown crotalid bites, 
respectively. In each case, the 
Fab antivenom drove most of the 
increase and increased markedly 
starting in 2007.
Level of Health Care and Treatment
Almost 40% (n = 7106 [38%]) of 
pediatric cases caused hospital 
admissions, and 1 in 5 reported 
cases were admitted to ICUs 
(n = 3541 [19%]). One-half of the 
patients (n = 9397) were treated 
and released, and <1% (n = 11) 
were admitted to a psychiatric 
facility.
Antivenom use ( 
Table 1) was highest 
for rattlesnake bites (n = 1181 
[41%]). More than one-third of bites 
by copperheads (n = 1278 [34%]), 
cottonmouths (n = 175 [35%]), and 
unknown crotalids (n = 684 [37%]) 
were treated with antivenom. Lower 
treatment percentages were reported 
for coral snakes (n = 36 [20%]) and 
unknown types of snakes (n = 1816 
[28%]).
Among 15 422 patients with 
potentially treatable snakebites, 
rattlesnake victims were 3.8 times 
(odds ratio, 3.80 [95% confidence 
interval, 3.48–4.13]) more likely 
to be admitted to an HCF than 
those patients bitten by all other 
types of snakes. Children bitten by 
rattlesnakes were 3.9 times (odds 
ratio, 3.92 [95% confidence interval, 
3.53–4.35]) more likely to be 
admitted to an HCF than those bitten 
by copperheads.
Exotic Snakes
Two percent (n = 368) of the 
exposures reported involved exotic 
snakes. Almost one-half of the exotic 
snakes were boa constrictors (n = 
182 [49%]), and 31 different exotic 
venomous species were reported. 
Nine percent of children (n = 76) 
with exotic snake encounters were 
admitted to the hospital, and 4% 
(n = 37) were ICU admissions.
DISCUSSION
The last comprehensive assessment 
of epidemiology of snakebites among 
children and adolescents of which 
we are aware was published in 1965 
when inpatient hospital records

in 10 states were reported. 
1 The 
present study provides data from 50 
states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, 
DC, and finds both similarities 
and differences. Copperheads 
and rattlesnakes remain the most 
common domestic venomous snakes 
reported; most snakebites are 
reported during summer months; 
and few deaths occurred. More 
than 1100 children and adolescents 
are bitten each year, and ∼20% 
of victims require ICU admission. 
Almost 50% of the reported 
snakebites were venomous, but 84% 
of all domestic snakebites could 
have been potentially treated with 
antivenom therapy.
Every state reported snakebite 
victims, but copperhead reports 
were focused in the southeastern US 
and rattlesnakes in the west. Three 
states (West Virginia, Oklahoma, 
and Louisiana) had the highest 
prevalence rates of both total bites 
and venomous bites. These findings 
suggest the potential benefit of 
prevention efforts tailored to 
states reporting large numbers of 
snakebites (Texas, Florida, Georgia, 
North Carolina, Arizona, and 
California) or have high prevalence 
rates (Oklahoma, West Virginia, and 
Louisiana).
We found that the use of antivenom 
for rattlesnake, copperhead, and 
unknown crotalid bites increased 
during the study period, especially 
after 2006. This finding is 
similar to those of earlier studies 
examining the use of antivenom 
for briefer time periods. 
4, 
 
14 Much 
of the augmented use is driven by 
copperhead bites, which increased 
107% during the study period; use 
of Fab antivenom for those bites 
increased 775%. Traditionally, 
antivenom treatment of copperheads 
was less common because their 
venom is less toxic, producing 
milder symptoms than bites by 
rattlesnakes or cottonmouths. 
15, 
 
16 
More recent studies have found 
that residual copperhead venom 
effects, including swelling, pain, and 
functional disability, may persist for 
13 days.17 Treatment with the newer 
Fab antivenom has become more 
common and can be expensive. Initial 
treatment requires at least 4 to 6 
vials of antivenom, and the patient’s 
charges for just the antivenom can be 
almost $100 000. 
18
Our study also prompts questions 
concerning the data regarding 
antivenom treatment. We had data on 
antivenom therapy for only 28% of 
pediatric reports, but up to 83% of all 
domestic snakebites were potentially 
treatable with antivenom according 
to our estimates. The seeming 
discrepancy may be explained by 
the variation in bites and symptoms 
that the bites produce. Up to 20% of 
venomous snakebites are dry, 
 
19, 
 
20 and 
the amount of venom injected varies 
among bites. Dry bites occur because 
a specific snake may have hunted 
and used all venom supplies. The 
severity of clinical manifestations can 
vary greatly, with minimal symptoms

to life-threatening complications, 
and they may not develop or 
progress slowly or rapidly. Systemic 
manifestations, usually attributed to 
venomous bites, can include rapid 
swelling, ecchymosis, and progression 
to hypotension, altered sensorium, 
tachycardia, respiratory distress, and 
severe coagulation abnormalities 
and require admission to the ICU. In 
many exposures, the exact snake is 
unidentified. This fact can complicate 
decisions about whether to use 
antivenom.
We found only 4 pediatric victims 
who died during the study period. 
This finding is consistent with earlier 
assessments that ∼5 persons of all 
ages die each year of snakebites in 
the United States. 
21
The type of snakebites that poison 
control centers are consulted about 
is also changing. Fifty years ago, 
no exotic species were reported. 
1 
In our report, only 2% of pediatric 
exposures were exotic species, but 
pet industry groups have estimated 
that 846 000 households own 
snakes. 
4 Some exotic species (all 
of them constrictors) have been 
restricted from further importation 
and from interstate transport by 
the federal government. 
22 It is 
reasonable to expect that the 
calls to poison control centers about 
exotic snakes will become more 
common.
The present study has a number of 
limitations. Our assessment was based 
on described exposures reported to US 
poison control centers by voluntary 
callers, which does not capture all 
incidents. The NPDS also does not 
capture detailed information on the 
anatomic site of the bite, the degree 
of envenomation, or the amount of 
antivenom used in treatment.
HCFs may treat snakebites and 
not consult with a poison center, 
especially if the treating physician 
chooses not to use antivenom. Some 
data may be miscoded. In addition, 
our data likely do not completely 
reflect the time of day when the 
snakebite occurred. The national 
data collection includes time of 
call but no data regarding time of 
exposure.
In addition, snakes may be 
improperly identified or not 
identified at all. NPDS data use 
voluntary self-reporting from 
health care providers, patients, 
and friends and family who have 
varying levels of knowledge, and 
the follow-up of cases may not 
be complete. However, NPDS 
data are the most comprehensive 
and accurate database for such 
exposures.
CONCLUSIONS
Our study found changes in the 
venomous snakebites reported, with 
increased numbers of copperhead bites 
reported, an increased use of newer 
antivenom therapy for species beyond 
rattlesnakes, and the emergence of 
exotic species. Educational prevention 
efforts should focus on states reporting 
large numbers of snakebites or high 
prevalence rates.
