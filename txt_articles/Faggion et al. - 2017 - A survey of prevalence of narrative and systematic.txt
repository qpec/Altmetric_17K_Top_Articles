journals

Abstract
Background: Systematic reviews may provide less biased evidence than narrative reviews because they observe a
strict methodology, similarly to primary studies. Hence, for clinical research questions, systematic reviews should be
the study design of choice. It would be important to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of narrative and
systematic reviews published in prominent medical journals. Researchers and clinicians give great value to articles
published in such scientific journals. This study sought to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of narrative and
systematic reviews in the five highest-ranked general medical journals and investigate the associations among type of
review, number of citations, and impact factor (IF).
Methods: We surveyed the five highest-ranked medical journals (The New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, The
Journal of the American Medical Association, The BMJ, and Annals of Internal Medicine) for narrative and systematic reviews
published between June 2015 and June 2016. We independently selected and extracted the data from the
reviews by strictly following the pre-determined eligibility criteria (Systematic and narrative reviews that focused on
the management of diseases). We conducted regression analyses to investigate the associations among review type,
number of citations, and IF. We also descriptively reported narrative reviews containing some methodology that might
be reproducible.
Results: Two hundred seventy-five reviews were included: 75 (27%) systematic; 126 (46%) narrative with some
methodology reported, and 74 (27%) narrative reviews. In comparison to systematic reviews, narrative reviews
were more frequently published in journals with higher IF (risk ratio [RR] = 1.114 (95% CI 1.080 to 1.149). Systematic reviews
received more citations than narrative reviews (group formed by narrative and narrative with some methodology reported
(RR = 0.985 95% CI 0.978 to 0.991).
Conclusions: Non-systematic evidence is the most prevalent type of evidence in reviews published in the five highest-ranked
general medical journals. Narrative reviews were more frequently published in journals with higher IF. We recommend that
journals limit their space for narrative information, and to address clinical research questions, these journals consider
publishing systematic evidence exclusively.

 Background
Systematic reviews are considered the best way to synthesize
evidence. This kind of review is developed with robust
methodology to ensure that the review is reproducible. In
contrast, narrative reviews do not include any pre-defined
methodology or structure, which renders the reproduction
of different steps challenging or impossible. One can argue
that a narrative review may be inherently biased and there-
fore should not be viewed as a scientific work. What is the
usefulness of research that cannot be reproduced? This
rationale may be in line with recent efforts to prevent the
wasteful use of research-related resources [1].
Evidence suggests that narrative reviews are frequently
cited in specific medical disciplines such as dentistry [2–4].
This study sought to evaluate the proportion and charac-
teristics of narrative and systematic reviews in major med-
ical journals. These journals are well regarded by both
researchers and clinicians who use information from these
journals for their research and clinical decision-making.
The aim of this study was to elucidate the current practice of
these journals in publishing systematic and non-systematic
evidence in the form of reviews.
Therefore, we scrutinized the five highest-ranked gen-
eral medical journals (as classified by impact factor (IF)
since 2015 in the annual Journal Citation Report (JCR)
published by Thomson Reuters) for narrative or system-
atic reviews. We also evaluated the association between
number of citations of the selected articles or journal IF
and type of review.
Methods
Eligibility criteria
Systematic and narrative reviews that focused on the man-
agement of diseases and had been published in one of five
major medical journals were selected for analysis. These
journals were chosen because we believe they publish a
higher proportion of studies/reviews with scientific merit
and clinical relevance. Reviews on other topics such as
methodological issues and statistics were excluded. Analysis
and commentary documents were also excluded. The
medical journals searched were: The New England Journal
of Medicine (NEJM; IF:59.558), The Lancet (Lancet)
(IF:44.002), The Journal of the American Medical Associ-
ation (JAMA) (IF:37.684), The British Medical Journal
(BMJ) (IF:19.697), and Annals of Internal Medicine (AIM)
(IF:16.593). We also categorized reviews with a population
health or policy-making (PHPM) perspective.
Types of reviews: Definitions
Reviews in this study were classified as one of three types:
Systematic review: We considered a review “system-
atic” when authors explicitly reported the intention to
perform a systematic review in the title, abstract or any
part of the text.
Narrative review with some methodology reported (nar-
rative review-SMR): Authors report some steps that
might be reproducible (e.g., data search and selection).
The inclusion of search strategy and selection criteria is a
requirement for publishing reviews in some journals [5, 6].
Narrative review: No report of the methodology used
to perform the review (e.g., procedures for data search
and selection). No part of the review can be reproduced.
Search strategy
We obtained the International Standard Serial Numbers
(ISSN) of the journals from the National Library of Medi-
cine (NLM). The ISSN facilitates a focused and precise
search. The ISSN numbers were: 0028–4793 for NEJM,
0140–6736 for Lancet, 0098–7484 for JAMA, 0959–8138
for BMJ, and 0003–4819 for AIM. A structured literature
search was performed in MEDLINE via PubMed using a
combination of ISSN numbers and the following key-
words: therapeutics OR therapeutic OR therapy OR ther-
apies OR treatment OR treatments. Finally, we applied the
following PubMed filters: “review”, “systematic reviews”,
and “custom date range (01 June 2015 to 01 June 2016)”.
Data selection and extraction
Two authors (CMF, JW) independently selected the reviews
by strictly following the pre-determined eligibility criteria.
Two authors (CMF, NB) independently extracted informa-
tion using a data extraction sheet developed by the first
author that related to the following variables: 1) number of
citations in Google Scholar received by different types of
reviews (citations retrieved in the period between 23 and 27
August 2017); 2) number and proportion of different types
of reviews published in the five medical journals included
in this sample. We organized the reviews in two types (re-
garding their purpose): 1) clinically oriented (CO): reviews
related to a clinical research question; 2) population health
or policy making oriented (PHPM): reviews with a popula-
tion perspective or more focused on the discussion of rele-
vant topics. We used the following criteria to organize the
reporting of methodology in the reviews: search strategy,
data selection, data extraction, and quality/risk of bias
(ROB) of primary studies included in the reviews. Disagree-
ments on data selection and extraction procedures were re-
solved by discussion until consensus was achieved.
Data analysis
We reported the distribution of reviews across the five
medical journals and characteristics regarding type of
review (narrative, systematic, or narrative review-SMR),
the number of citations received (median and range), and
IF (median and range). We checked types of reviews pub-
lished in the five medical journals (which have different
IF) and calculated the average IF (from 2015). After fitting
a multinomial logistic regression model, we calculated risk

Page 2 of 7
 ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes with respective 95%
confidence intervals (CI). For this calculation, we grouped
narrative reviews and narrative reviews-SMR into one
group (narrative*). Furthermore, the associations were
investigated inversely, using linear regression with type of
review (narrative* = 1, systematic = 0) as predictor, and the
number of citations and journal impact factor as dependent
variables. Given that the predictor is dichotomous, the chi2
test was utilized (instead of the p-value) as significance
measure. All data analysis was performed with MATLAB
version R2016b (MathWorks Inc., Natick, Massachusetts).
Results
Our initial search yielded 372,245 documents. After use of
the PubMed filters, 399 of these were selected. After inde-
pendent scrutiny of the titles and abstracts, we excluded an
additional 124 documents because they failed to meet the
methodological definition of a systematic, narrative review-
SMR, or narrative review (list of excluded articles with rea-
sons for exclusion in the Additional file 1). A total of 275
reviews were ultimately included. The full list of articles
included in this study is reported in the Additional file 2.
Table 1 and Fig. 1 report the distribution of reviews
across the five medical journals examined. Most reviews
were CO narrative reviews-SMR (N = 117, 43%), followed
by CO systematic reviews (N = 73, 26%), CO narrative re-
views (N = 51, 19%), PHPM narrative reviews (N = 23, 8%),
PHPM narrative reviews-SMR (N = 9, 3%), and PHPM sys-
tematic reviews (N = 2, 1%). Lancet contributed the most
reviews (N = 118, 43%). JAMA contributed the fewest
reviews (N = 25, 9%). Lancet published the most CO nar-
rative reviews-SMR (N = 70, 25%), and NEJM published
the most CO narrative reviews (N = 30, 11%). NEJM contrib-
uted only narrative reviews to the present sample. Figure 2
reports the percentage of the different types of reviews (nar-
rative* and systematic) published in each of the five journals.
Narrative* reviews include narrative reviews plus narrative
reviews-SMR. Table 2 presents the characteristics of narra-
tive* and systematic reviews. Following the pre-defined
evaluation criteria, 126 narrative reviews (63%) of this sample
reported information on how authors performed the search
of literature.
The median number of citations was 45 (range = 2 to
311), 29.5 (range = 0 to 215), and 43 (range 9 to 388) for
narrative, narrative reviews-SMR, and systematic reviews,
respectively. The median number of citations for narra-
tive* reviews was 35 (range 0 to 311). The median IF was
44 (range 17 to 60), 44 (range 17 to 44), and 20 (range 17
to 44) for narrative, narrative reviews-SMR, and system-
atic reviews, respectively.
Logistic regression analysis generated a RR for the citations
of 0.985 (95% CI 0.978 to 0.991) and for the IF 1.114 (95%
CI 1.080 to 1.149). The coefficient for the citations regression
was −18.17 (p = 0.0308) and for IF 13.19 (p < 0.001).
Discussion
The present findings suggest that highly ranked medical
journals publish more narrative reviews than systematic
reviews. In this sample of reviews, the majority of reviews
addressing clinical questions are narrative or narrative
reviews-SMR. Compared with systematic reviews, narra-
tive and narrative reviews-SMR are more likely to be pub-
lished in highly ranked medical journals with higher IF.
Systematic reviews, however, receive more citations than
narrative and narrative reviews-SMR.
In one study [7] that evaluated the publication of system-
atic reviews in orthopaedic journals, the authors hypothe-
sized that the number of citations for systematic reviews
published in leading orthopaedic journals would be greater
than the number of citations for narrative reviews published
in the same journal. The authors found that “rigorous” (in
their evaluation) systematic reviews received more citations
than non-rigorous systematic and narrative reviews. Another
study [8] evaluated five journals that published the most sys-
tematic reviews among a sample of 170 clinical journals in
various medical fields. The authors found that systematic
reviews were cited more often than narrative reviews. Simi-
lar results were found in a meta-analysis [9] that determined
which among a large sample of articles received the greatest
number of citations (N = 2646). In that study, narrative re-
views received fewer citations than other types of reviews.

 Our findings are in agreement with publications above,
although some other studies report the opposite. For ex-
ample, in the field of dentistry some studies revealed more
numerous citations for narrative reviews in comparison to
systematic reviews [2–4]. These findings are supported by
another study published in the field of dermatology [10]
that found that authors of clinical trials and narrative
reviews do not frequently cite systematic reviews. Some
methodological [11] and discipline related issues might
explain this variability on the association type of review
and number of citations.
The present results demonstrate that much information
reported in reviews published in these five journals derives
from potentially biased evidence. One might argue that all
types of information are subject to bias, including studies
with well-recognized methodology, such as systematic
reviews. However, because these studies have a defined
structure, they are vulnerable to audit and quality evalu-
ation. For example, tools such as A Measurement Tool to
Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) [12] and a tool to
assess risk of bias in systematic reviews (ROBIS) [13] can
be used to evaluate the methodological quality and risk of
bias of systematic review domains. In contrast, narrative
reviews do not allow for this type of evaluation because
they do not have a structured framework. Therefore,
evaluating the methodology and quality of narrative re-
views is challenging, if not impossible. Our results are in
fact an optimistic view of reality, taking into account that
other types of articles (commentaries, opinion paper etc.
which are not systematic) were not included in our ana-
lysis. Thus, we might have an even worst scenario on the
evidence currently used to support clinical decisions.
The present study included a group of narrative
reviews-SMR in order to differentiate studies with partially
reproducible methodology from those without any repro-
ducible methodology, i.e. narrative reviews. We under-
stand this is the fairest judgement of articles that, at least,
explicitly reported part of the methodology. Based on our
evaluation criteria, these narrative reviews-SMR described
the search strategy used in their reviews. In fact, most

 articles in this group come from Lancet and BMJ journals,
where sections in the paper are entitled “search strategy
and selection criteria” (Lancet) and “sources and selection
criteria” (BMJ). The selection criteria section in these arti-
cles, however, does not seem to be reported in enough
detail for repeatability and traceability [14]. Nevertheless,
these reviews do not allow for the complete reproduction
of several steps and may therefore be considered as narra-
tive reviews based on non-systematic evidence.
In our study, narrative* reviews were more frequently
published in journals with higher IF, as demonstrated by
the regression coefficients. Furthermore, the reported RR
indicates that the probability of a review being narrative*
(compared to the probability of being systematic) increases
1.114 times for each unit increase in the journal IF. This
outcome likely reflects the fact that all publications in the
journal with the highest IF (NEJM) were narrative reviews.
These findings are in agreement with outcomes in other
medical fields, such as dentistry and oncology, in which
journals with the highest IF [15, 16] tend to publish invited
narrative reviews. Based on this information, we postulate
that readers may not be aware of the importance of the
methodology of reviews in such highly ranked journals. For
readers, publication in a highly ranked journal might be suf-
ficient to confirm the quality of the article. It is, however,
important to emphasize that narrative reviews published in
such high-level medical journals are authored by specialists
in their fields. Thus, it is likely that the work will be high-
quality. The articles in these journals must pass a strict and
rigid peer-review process [17], a process that supports the
delivery of reliable work. Furthermore, publishing in one of
these journals is quite difficult. These journals have low
acceptance rates, and some evidence suggests that low rates
of manuscript acceptance appear to predict higher meth-
odological quality scores [18]. Thus, one can consider high
IF as a proxy for quality. Nevertheless, these are arguments
based on the backgrounds of people and journals involved
in the process, rather than facts that can be measured, veri-
fied and replicated [19]. A study’s quality should be
determined on its own merits rather than on the back-
ground and quality of its authors.
The present article does not recommend the total elim-
ination of narrative reviews. These types of reviews have a
place in science, but they should not be the first option for
scientists seeking information to address clinical ques-
tions. Narrative reviews could be used to facilitate discus-
sion of relevant topics. Because of its lack of structure
(and consequent invulnerability to audit), a narrative
review should not be used as the basis for any strategy
(therapeutic or otherwise) to address human disease.
High-quality medical journals could implement a policy of
limiting the space devoted to “non-systematic” literature.
Information serving as the basis for further research or
decision-making should be published only when a system-
atic and reproducible approach was used. This approach
would help to prevent research based on biased informa-
tion. Because the focus of our study was on reviews on
interventions, we also organised the reviews on CO and
PHPM. The idea was to provide the reader with a better
picture when the focus of the review is to facilitate discus-
sion, (PHPM) or to address management of diseases (CO).
We understand that a review focusing on the management

 of diseases require a more systematic approach to avoid or
to reduce the chances of biased results.
Some limitations of the present study should be dis-
cussed. Firstly, the study included a select group of medical
journals. One can consider this information being represen-
tative to these five journals only. However, the literature
search in only these five medical journals was the main in-
clusion criterion in our study, and it might be considered a
“strength” due to the potential impact of the present find-
ings on the research and medical community. As commen-
ted above, these journals are considered the best medical
journals available, as indicated by their very high IF.
Researchers will very likely use studies reported in these
journals to plan and perform their own research. Similarly,
clinicians will use the evidence reported in these journals to
support their decisions on therapeutic approaches. Sec-
ondly, we conducted the literature search over a relatively
short period of one year. Hence, we cannot extrapolate the
findings to older reviews. However, there is no reason to
believe that the pattern of publication of narrative, narrative
reviews-SMR and systematic reviews has changed over
time. Because the systematic review was developed more
recently than the narrative review, one would expect these
journals to have published a greater proportion of narrative
reviews in earlier years. Furthermore, with the rise of
evidence-based medicine in recent years, researchers and
clinicians should be more aware of the importance of meth-
odology. Such an awareness might result in a greater pro-
portion of systematic reviews.
The present study also intends to encourage discussion
on a global definition for systematic reviews. We used a
definition based on the intention of authors to perform a
systematic review, instead of definitions published in the
literature [14, 20, 21] (see Additional file 3, systematic
review definitions) which are all based on the perspectives
of authors evaluating systematic reviews.
The main problem in defining systematic reviews is to
determine thresholds for what is systematic and what is
not. For example, two definitions [14, 20] report “reprodu-
cibility” as key characteristics of a systematic review. If this
criterion is applied, many systematic reviews included in
overviews would probably not be considered systematic. A
recent publication showed that the information necessary
to reproduce meta-analytic estimates was reported in only
65% of systematic reviews of biomedical interventions
[22]. Many overviews of systematic reviews demonstrated
that there is poor reporting of systematic reviews in differ-
ent medical disciplines when the PRISMA checklist is
applied [23–26]. Thus, this poor reporting would limit (or
even make impossible) the reproducibility of the method-
ology, and this criterion would not be met for selecting
the review as systematic. Furthermore, we understand that
judging the review from the intention of authors to per-
form a systematic review leads to a more fair evaluation.
One can argue that authors not explicitly reporting a sys-
tematic review would have an unfair judgement when
quality tools are applied. For example, if authors of the
review intend to publish a narrative review, but authors of
the overview considered it as a systematic review. Hence,
a narrative review would be judged as systematic. Finally,
by including reviews with poor or no methodology, but
named as systematic by review authors, clinicians and
non-methodologist readers will have more comprehensive
information to differentiate the robust from the methodo-
logically poor systematic reviews. This information would
then be provided in the quality/ROB evaluation of reviews
with available methodological tools [12, 13].
A previous study [8] also compared systematic and narra-
tive reviews in medical literature. They defined a review as
systematic when “the authors had to clearly state the clinical
topic of the review, how the evidence was retrieved and
from what sources (i.e., naming the databases), and provide
explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria.” Thus, these criteria
would meet the criteria for defining a narrative review-SMR
in our sample. One may consider that some reviews
regarded as systematic by Montori et al. [8] could be, in fact,
narrative reviews. We provided an analysis of narrative and
systematic reviews (Table 2) to report to what extent sys-
tematic reviews are in fact systematic, by applying some
criteria reported in published systematic review definitions.
Conclusions
The present study demonstrated that narrative reviews are
more prevalent than systematic reviews in highly ranked
medical journals. Much of the evidence provided by these
journals does not represent reproducible findings. We rec-
ommend that, to address clinical research questions, these
journals consider publishing systematic evidence exclu-
sively. Editors of medical journals should limit the amount
of non-systematic evidence to reduce the probability of
delivering biased information to readers. Further discussion
on a consensus definition for systematic reviews is needed.
