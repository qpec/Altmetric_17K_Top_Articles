SUMMARY
The current widespread outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been linked to severe clinical 
birth defects, particularly microcephaly, warranting urgent study of the molecular mechanisms 
underlying ZIKV pathogenesis. Akt-mTOR signaling is one of the key cellular pathways essential 
for brain development and autophagy regulation. Here, we show that ZIKV infection of human 
fetal neural stem cells (fNSCs) causes inhibition of the Akt-mTOR pathway, leading to defective 
neurogenesis and aberrant activation of autophagy. By screening the three structural proteins and 
seven nonstructural proteins present in ZIKV, we found that two, NS4A and NS4B, cooperatively 
suppress the Akt-mTOR pathway and lead to cellular dysregulation. Corresponding proteins from 
the closely related dengue virus do not have the same effect on neurogenesis. Thus, our study

Abstract
INTRODUCTION
Zika virus (ZIKV), a reemerging arthropod-bone flavivirus, was initially isolated from 
Rhesus macaque in Uganda as early as 1947, while the first human infection was reported in 
1954 (Dick, 1952; Dick et al., 1952; Simpson, 1964). Although sexually transmitted cases 
have been recently documented, ZIKV is most commonly transmitted through the bites of 
infected Aedes mosquitoes (Musso et al., 2015; Venturi et al., 2016). Individuals infected by 
ZIKV typically develop a mild or unapparent dengue-like disease (Duffy et al., 2009). 
However, mounting evidence has linked ZIKV infection to neurological defects in newborns 
(De Carvalho et al., 2016). Furthermore, ZIKV was detected in the amniotic fluids of 
pregnant women as well as in the brain tissues of microcephalic fetuses, suggesting that 
ZIKV can potentially cross the placental barrier to infect fetuses (Calvet et al., 2016; Mlakar 
et al., 2016). In addition, an increased rate of Guillain-Barré syndrome was noted following 
the ZIKV outbreak in French Polynesia from 2013 to 2014 (Cauchemez et al., 2016). The 
World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern 
(Heymann et al., 2016), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that 
ZIKV causes microcephaly and other birth defects. Although ZIKV infection impairs the 
growth of neurospheres and brain or-ganoids derived from iPSCs (Garcez et al., 2016; Qian 
et al., 2016), the molecular mechanism by which ZIKV infection induces fetal microcephaly 
remains elusive. In particular, dengue virus (DENV), a closely related member of the 
flaviviridae family, has not been linked to either microcephaly or defects in neurogenesis 
(Garcez et al., 2016), suggesting that ZIKV’s neuropathology might be causally linked to 
those differences in its sequence from dengue.

 Neurogenesis, the key process by which neurons are differentiated from neural stem cells 
(NSCs) or neural progenitor cells (NPCs), is most active during prenatal development and 
responsible for populating the growing brain with neurons (Götz and Huttner, 2005). 
Genetic defects that are associated with neurogenesis and migration often result in human 
developmental neurological disorders including microcephaly (Ming and Song, 2011). A 
number of key cellular signaling pathways, including the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, are 
essential for neurogenesis from NSCs, as well as for subsequent migration and maturation 
(Lee, 2015; Wahane et al., 2014). Recent studies have shown that activating mutations in the 
PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway may occur in brain overdevelopment syndromes, which include 
megalencephaly-capillary malformation and megalencephaly-polydactyly-polymicrogyria-
hydrocephalus (Mirzaa et al., 2013). In contrast, mTOR inhibition in the developing brain 
causes microcephaly (Cloëtta et al., 2013). Upstream to mTOR, Akt is the central signaling 
molecule in the PI3K pathway, and it plays critical roles in brain development as well as 
synaptic plasticity (Franke, 2008). Non-functional Akt mutation leads to microcephaly in 
humans (Mirzaa et al., 2013), while activating Akt mutation causes megalencephaly (Nellist 
et al., 2015; Rivière et al., 2012). Expression of dominant-negative Akt also blocks neuronal 
production from human NSCs isolated from fetuses in vitro (Guo et al., 2013). Hence, 
human pathogens, including DNA viruses, have been found to hijack the PI3K-Akt-mTOR 
pathway for their successful replication in mammalian cells (Buchkovich et al., 2008). Yet 
despite the common outcomes of ZIKV infection and PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway inhibition, 
no causal association between the two has yet been reported.
Flaviviruses, such as DENV, Hepatitis C virus (HCV), and ZIKV, have been shown to 
modulate cellular autophagy to benefit their replication in host cells (Hamel et al., 2015; 
Heaton and Randall, 2010; Sir et al., 2012). Macroautophagy, often referred to as autophagy, 
is an important catabolic process involving the formation of double-membrane vesicles, 
called autophagosomes, which sequester cytoplasmic damaged organelles, protein 
aggregates, or invading intracellular pathogens for degradation (Levine et al., 2011). The 
mTOR kinase serves as a gatekeeper for autophagy induction: the activation of mTOR by 
Akt and MAPK signaling suppresses autophagy, and the inactivation of mTOR by AMPK 
and p53 signaling promotes autophagy. Autophagy is also an active cellular protective 
mechanism against viral infection; viruses thus try to modulate autophagy to benefit their 
life cycles. Certain herpesviruses suppress autophagy by their viral proteins to establish 
persistent infection (Liang et al., 2013, 2015; Williams and Taylor, 2012). Interestingly, 
certain flaviviruses such as ZIKV and DENV have recently been reported to hijack 
autophagy to similarly support viral replication (Hamel et al., 2015; Heaton and Randall, 
2010). Specifically, DENV NS4A upregulates autophagy in epithelial cells (McLean et al., 
2011). However, it is currently unknown whether ZIKV infection induces autophagy through 
a similar mechanism to DENV. Nevertheless, understanding the molecular mechanism 
underlying ZIKV-induced autophagy activation in host cells may shed insight on its 
pathogenesis.
Recent reports using human NSCs have demonstrated the vulnerability of these cells to 
ZIKV infection (Garcez et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2016), as well as the growth defects of 
iPSC-derived neural organoids in response to ZIKV infection (Garcez et al., 2016; Qian et 
al., 2016). Several groups also defined the birth defects from different pregnant mouse

 models when exposed to ZIKV (Cugola et al., 2016; Lazear et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016; 
Miner et al., 2016; Rossi et al., 2016). These suggest the direct cause of ZIKV for human 
microcephaly via intrauterine infection and defective neurogenesis. However, no analogous 
studies have been performed on native human fetal tissues or NSCs, largely due to the 
limited availability of fetal human tissue. Here, we utilized two primary isolates of fNSCs, 
recovered from second trimester human fetuses, a gestational period of great ZIKV 
vulnerability in human brain development, to study how ZIKV infection impairs fetal brain 
development. We found that ZIKV infection of human fNSCs results in the inhibition of 
neurosphere growth and neurogenic differentiation potential, as well as the induction of 
autophagy. Further screening for ZIKV proteins revealed that the cooperation of NS4A and 
NS4B strongly suppresses host Akt-mTOR signaling, potentially leading to the impairment 
of neurogenesis of human fNSCs and the upregulation of autophagy, synergistically 
promoting viral replication.
RESULTS
Infection of Human fNSCs with ZIKV Leads to Impaired Neurosphere Formation and 
Elevated Autophagy
In order to model ZIKV infection in human fNSCs (Guo et al., 2013; Keyoung et al., 2001; 
Wang et al., 2010), we first infected fNSCs with three ZIKV strains (MR766, IbH30656, and 
H/PF/2013) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. Consistent with NSCs derived from 
human iPSCs (Garcez et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2016), ZIKV efficiently infected fNSCs 
(Figures S1A–S1C), and the infection of fNSCs with ZIKV MR766, IbH30656, and H/PF/
2013 led to 4.4-, 5.2-, and 5.5-fold increases of cell death, respectively, when compared with 
mock treatment (Figures 1A and 1B). At 3 days post-infection (dpi), mock-treated fNSCs in 
suspension culture formed neurospheres that had an average size of 81.7 μm (Figures 1C–
1E). However, MR766-, IbH30656-, or H/PF/2013-infected fNSCs at MOI 0.01 formed 
fewer neurospheres with smaller average sizes of 54.3 μm, 51.2 μm, or 52.6 μm, respectively 
(Figures 1D and 1E). Immuno-histological analysis on 7 dpi neurospheres showed the 
presence of ZIKV E antigen within the neurospheres (Figures 1F and S1D). In addition, 
ZIKV-infected neurospheres contained more apoptotic cells than mock-infected 
neurospheres, as shown by in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated 
digoxigenin-dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) (Figure 1G). Correlation analysis between 
neurosphere sizes and cell death from 30 mock-treated and 30 ZIKV-infected neurospheres 
showed that ZIKV infection augmented the death of fNSCs in the neurospheres, in 
proportion to their size (Figure S1E). While ZIKV infection did not alter the expression of 
neural stem cell markers, e.g., Nestin and SOX2 (Figures 1F and 1G), it led to the 
progressive reduction of fNSC proliferation as reflected by BrdU incorporation (Figure 
S1F). These results show that ZIKV infection not only induces the death of human fNSCs 
but also impairs their proliferation and clonal expansion in neurospheres.
The endoplasmic reticulum provides a membrane platform for the biogenesis of flavivirus 
replication complex, and autophagy-dependent processing of lipid droplets is required for 
efficient flavivirus replication (Heaton and Randall, 2010). To determine changes in the level 
of autophagy upon ZIKV infection, we examined the light chain 3 (LC3)-I to LC3-II

 conversion and the formation of LC3 punctate structure in ZIKV-infected fNSCs. Infection 
with ZIKV strains MR766 and IbH30656 efficiently induced LC3-I to LC3-II conversion 
and LC3 puncta formation of fNSCs in the presence or absence of lysosome inhibitor 
bafilomycin A1 (Figures 1H–1I and S1G–S1I). The p62/SQSTM level also decreased due to 
ZIKV-mediated autophagosome maturation (Figures 1H and S1G). Similar results were 
obtained from HeLa cells and MEFs (Figures S1J–S1L and S2A–S2D). To investigate the 
role of autophagy in ZIKV infection, we assessed ZIKV replication using Atg3 knockout 
(KO) MEFs, in which autophagy is completely defective due to the loss of the Atg3 E2 
enzyme. ZIKV replication was reduced by approximately 7-fold in Atg3 KO MEFs 
compared to wild-type MEFs (Figures S2E and S2F). In addition, ZIKV-infected Atg3 KO 
MEFs showed no detectable LC3-I to LC3-II conversion (Figure S1L). Similar results were 
obtained in Atg5 KO MEFs, and Atg3 or Atg13 knockdown fNSCs (Figures S2G–S2I). 
Accordingly, the induction of autophagy by rapamycin promoted ZIKV load in both fNSCs 
and HeLa cells, whereas the inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA or chloroquine impaired 
ZIKV load (Figures 1J, S2J, and S2K). These results indicate that ZIKV infection induces 
autophagy in fNSCs, which in turn leads to increased ZIKV replication and viral load.
ZIKV NS4A and NS4B Suppress Neurogenesis of Human fNSCs
Previous reports (Garcez et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2016) as well as our current study 
demonstrate that ZIKV infection impairs the growth and proliferation of iPSC-derived NSCs 
and fNSCs. Like other flavivirus family members, ZIKV is expected to encode ten viral 
proteins including three structural and seven non-structural proteins (NSs). To determine 
which viral proteins might play inhibitory roles in cell proliferation and neurosphere 
formation, human fNSCs were transduced with lentivirus containing each ZIKV gene and 
examined for neurosphere formation (Figures S3A–S3C). Expression of each ZIKV protein 
was detected by immunoblotting at 2 dpi (Figure S3D), and the size and number of 
neurospheres were measured at 7 dpi. Interestingly, human fNSCs expressing NS4A or 
NS4B exhibited impaired neurosphere formation (Figure 2A), as reflected in their reduced 
efficiency of neurosphere production from standard aliquots of 1 × 105 fNSCs (Figure 2B). 
Moreover, the majority of neurospheres (>90%) were less than 100 μm in diameter (Figure 
2C), and the average neurosphere size significantly reduced by 40.3% or 32.3%, 
respectively, when NS4A or NS4B was expressed (Figure S3C). Remarkably, co-expression 
of NS4A and NS4B resulted in further inhibition of neurosphere formation, with the near 
absence of neurospheres with diameters of 100 μm or higher and a reduction of average 
neurosphere size by 52.0% (Figures 2A–2C and S3A–S3C). Unlike ZIKV NS4A and NS4B, 
co-expression of DENV NS4A and NS4B did not cause the significant inhibition of 
neurosphere formation under the same conditions (Figures S3E–S3G).
BrdU incorporation analysis showed that expression of NS4A, NS4B, or NS4A-NS4B also 
altered the proliferation rates of fNSCs (Figures 2D–2F) without affecting the expression of 
fNSCs markers, including SOX2 (Figure 2A). Specifically, the expression of NS4A, NS4B, 
or NS4A-NS4B led to a 48.9%, 44.1%, or 64.7% reduction of fNSC proliferation, 
respectively, compared to the vector control (Figure 2D). In addition, immunostaining for 
Nestin and Ki-67 showed that expression of NS4A, NS4B, or NS4A-NS4B led to a ~43%, 
~28%, or ~63% reduction of Nestin+-and Ki-67+-positive proliferating fNSCs, respectively,

 compared with that of vector control (Figures 2E and 2F). More interestingly, when fNSCs 
were cultured on poly-L-ornithine- and laminin-coated surface for 10 days to induce their 
differentiation into neuronal cells (Guo et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2010), fNSCs expressing 
NS4A, NS4B, or NS4A-NS4B poorly differentiated into neurons or astrocytes (Figures 2G–
2J). Upon expression of NS4A, NS4B, or NS4A-NS4B, the differentiation rates to the β3-
tubulin-positive neuronal cells and GFAP-positive astrocytes were reduced by approximately 
25%–54% and 28%–51%, respectively (Figures 2H and 2J). However, expression of NS4A, 
NS4B, or NS4A-NS4B did not lead to apoptotic cell death in fNSCs, suggesting that 
expression of NS4A and NS4B is not toxic to cells (Figure S3H). Collectively, these data 
demonstrate that mitotic neurogenesis of fNSCs is selectively and substantially impaired by 
ZIKV NS4A and NS4B when these proteins are ectopically expressed individually and in 
combination.
ZIKV NS4A and NS4B Induce Autophagy in Human fNSCs
Since ZIKV infection induces autophagy in multiple cell types, we attempted to determine 
which viral proteins trigger that process. Transient expression of individual ZIKV genes in 
HeLa-GFP-LC3 cells showed that the expression of either NS4A or NS4B had marginal 
effects on GFP-LC3 punctate formation, whereas the co-expression of both NS4A and 
NS4B led to a significant increase in GFP-LC3 punctate numbers per cell (Figures 3A–3B 
and S4A–S4D). Furthermore, when fNSCs or HeLa cells stably expressing vector, NS4A, 
NS4B, or NS4A-NS4B were used, expression of NS4A-NS4B also resulted in a significant 
increase of LC3 I→II conversion in the presence or absence of lysosome inhibitor 
bafilomycin A1 (Figures 3C–3F, S4E, and S4F). In addition, NS4A interacted with NS4B in 
cells (Figure S4H), and the partial colocalizations between GFP-LC3 and NS4A or NS4B 
were also detected (Figure S4G). These results show that ZIKV NS4A and NS4B 
collaborate to induce efficient autophagy.
ZIKV NS4A and NS4B Inhibit Akt-mTOR Signaling
Akt-mTOR signaling is essential for neurogenesis by human fNSCs as well as for the 
induction of autophagy. Specifically, Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473 is required 
for its full kinase activity (Chan et al., 2014) and subsequently, Akt-mediated mTOR 
phosphorylation at Ser2448 is essential for keeping autophagy in check. Our results show 
that ZIKV replication led to the suppression of Akt phosphorylation at both Thr308 and 
Ser473, which subsequently led to the reduction of mTOR phosphorylation at Ser2448 
(Figures 4A and S4I). Further screening of individual ZIKV protein revealed that expression 
of either NS4A or NS4B detectably reduced Akt phosphorylation at both Thr308 and Ser473 
under normal conditions (Figure 4B). When starved fNSCs or HeLa cells stably expressing 
vector, NS4A, NS4B, or NS4A-NS4B were stimulated with serum or insulin, expression of 
either NS4A or NS4B detectably suppressed the Thr308 and Ser437 phosphorylations of 
Akt, and co-expression of NS4A and NS4B drastically suppressed the Thr308 and Ser473 
phosphorylations of Akt (Figures 4C–4E). Consequently, co-expression of NS4A and NS4B 
resulted in the reduced levels of mTOR phosphorylation at Ser2448 (Figures 4C–4E). To 
confirm that the increased autophagy by NS4A-NS4B was caused by impaired Akt/mTOR 
signaling, we expressed the constitutively active form of Akt3 (myr-HA-Akt3 E17K) in 
fNSCs to examine whether it blocked ZIKV infection- or NS4A-NS4B-expression-mediated

 autophagy (Baek et al., 2015). As shown in Figures S4J and S4K, ectopic expression of the 
constitutively active form of Akt3 suppressed ZIKV infection- or NS4A-NS4B-expression-
mediated autophagy. These results suggest that ZIKV NS4A and NS4B inhibit the Akt-
mTOR signaling pathway, which in turn impedes the neurogenesis of fNSCs and increases 
autophagy.
DISCUSSION
Recent ZIKV outbreaks in South and Central America and the unexpected association 
between ZIKV infection and birth defects have attracted global attention to the need to study 
the pathogenesis of ZIKV-associated microcephaly and to develop therapeutic interventions 
against it. Recent reports demonstrated that ZIKV infection impairs growth in iPSC-derived 
human neurospheres and brain organoids (Garcez et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2016). Infection 
of different mouse models has revealed that ZIKV infection can cause neurological 
development anomalies in mice as well (Lazear et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016; Miner et al., 
2016; Rossi et al., 2016). Yet to date, no detailed molecular mechanisms underlying ZIKV 
pathogenesis have been unveiled, hence hindering the development of ZIKV-targeted anti-
viral therapy. In this paper, we utilized NSCs isolated from human fetuses between 18 and 
22 weeks of gestational age to study how ZIKV infection impairs growth and neurogenesis 
of fNSCs. By screening the three structural proteins and seven NSs of ZIKV, we found that 
the cooperation of NS4A and NS4B strongly suppresses host Akt-mTOR signaling, 
consequently leading to the impairment of neurogenesis of human fNSCs and the 
upregulation of autophagy for viral replication.
Autophagy is a lysosome-mediated catabolic process that also developed as an important 
ancient immune response during evolution. Although hosts have evolved autophagy to 
maintain cellular homeostasis and limited pathogen infection, some pathogens such as 
flaviviruses usurp cellular autophagy pathways to benefit their life cycles. ZIKV infection 
induces autophagy in multiple cell types including fNSCs. Our results demonstrate that the 
autophagy inducer rapamycin increases ZIKV replication, whereas the autophagy inhibitor 
3-MA or chloroquine decreases ZIKV replication. Although these inducers or inhibitors also 
affect additional pathways besides autophagy, genetic KO or knockdown of several 
autophagy genes shows the specific suppression of ZIKV replication, suggesting that an 
efficient replication of ZIKV depends on the autophagy pathway. In fact, DENV replication 
requires autophagy to control processing of lipid droplets and triglycerides (Heaton and 
Randall, 2010) and HCV uses autophagosomal membranes as sites for its RNA replication 
(Sir et al., 2012). Thus, these findings suggest that ZIKV may also require host autophagy 
pathways to create the membrane structures to serve as viral replication sites.
By screening the ten ZIKV-encoding potential proteins, we found that NS4A and NS4B 
cooperate to induce efficient autophagy by suppressing the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway 
that is essential for controlling stimulation-induced autophagy. Similar to DENV NS4A and 
NS4B, ZIKV NS4A and NS4B are small hydrophobic proteins with potential 
transmembrane spanning regions (Zou et al., 2015). While DENV NS4A alone induces 
autophagy (McLean et al., 2011), an individual expression of ZIKV NS4A or NS4B has 
weak effects on autophagy, suggesting that ZIKV utilizes different molecular mechanisms

 from DENV to induce autophagy. While expression of the constitutively active Akt fully 
suppressed either ZIKV infection-or NS4A-NS4B-expression-mediated autophagy, it is 
possible that the mechanism of ZIKV infection-mediated autophagy is not entirely identical 
to that of NS4A-NS4B-expression-mediated autophagy. Future studies with the reverse 
genetic analysis of ZIKV are needed to address how NS4A and NS4B target and inhibit Akt 
in the context of viral genome (Shan et al., 2016).
The Akt-mTOR signaling pathway is critical not only for controlling autophagy induction, 
but also for cortical development (Franke, 2008). Mutations in this pathway lead to several 
disorders, such as megalencephaly by the constitutive activation of Akt and microcephaly by 
the loss of function of Akt (Mirzaa et al., 2013). Our data suggest that ZIKV NS4A and 
NS4B suppress the activation of Akt, consequently leading to the impairment of 
proliferation and differentiation of fNSCs in vitro. These may serve as a potential molecular 
mechanism by which ZIKV infection can lead to neurological disorders such as 
microcephaly. Due to its crucial role in cell growth and differentiation, Akt activity is tightly 
controlled by post-translational modifications. Phosphorylations on Thr308 by PDK1 and on 
Ser473 by mTORC2 are important for Akt activation, and phosphatases such as PTEN, 
PP2A, and PHLPP antagonize Akt activation. Other modifications such as ubiquitination, 
SUMOylation, acetylation, and O-GlcNAcylation have been also shown to positively or 
negatively regulate Akt activities (Chan et al., 2014). Our study suggests that ZIKV NS4A 
and NS4B block Akt activation by inhibiting upstream PI3K signaling and potentially 
modulating Akt post-translational modifications as well. Further studies will be required to 
parse the specific means by which ZIKV NS4A and NS4B influence Akt activation.
It should be noted that we utilized primary fNSCs recovered from human fetuses to 
demonstrate how three ZIKV strains (MR766, IbH30656, and H/PF/2013) can impair the 
growth and neurogenesis of human fNSCs. Regardless of the viral strains and fNSC isolates, 
similar levels of neurogenesis inhibition and autophagy induction were observed. However, 
it is possible that the ongoing epidemic ZIKV strains in Brazil and other South American 
countries may cause more severe defects in the proliferation of fNSCs and subsequent 
differentiation during corticogenesis. On the other hand, since the sequences of NS4A and 
NS4B are almost identical across various ZIKV strains, additional factors might also be 
associated with pathogenesis of the ongoing epidemic ZIKV strains. Additional studies are 
ongoing to demonstrate the functions of NS4A and NS4B in in vitro brain organoid models 
and in vivo IFNAR1 KO mouse models. In summary, our research provides new mechanistic 
insights on how NS4A and NS4B phenocopy ZIKV pathogenesis in vitro, implicating them 
as potential anti-ZIKV therapeutic targets.

and 4 mM glutamine. C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS, 
non-essential amino acids, and HEPES at 28° with 5% CO2. Transient transfections were 
performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). HeLa stable cell lines were generated 
using a standard selection protocol with puromycin (2 μg/mL) for individual expressions of 
ZIKV gene, or puromycin with hygromycin (200 μg/mL) for the co-expression of NS4A-
NS4B.

 Highlights
•
ZIKV infects human fNSCs, leading to defective neurogenesis and 
increased autophagy
•
Expression of ZIKV NS4A and NS4B blocks neurogenesis and 
promotes autophagy
•
Two ZIKV proteins, NS4A and NS4B, inhibit Akt-mTOR signaling

 In Brief
Liang et al. show that after infection of human fetal neural stem cells, the ZIKV proteins 
NS4A and NS4B inhibit the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, disrupting neurogenesis and 
inducing autophagy. Their study therefore identifies candidate molecular determinants of 
ZIKV pathogenesis and highlights potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
