In Brief
Novellasdemunt et al. find that an APC-
truncating mutation activates Wnt
signaling by promoting USP7-mediated
b-catenin deubiquitination. USP7
inhibition significantly suppresses tumor
growth of APC-mutated colon cancer
cells but does not affect cells with wild-
type APC, suggesting that it can be used
as a tumor-specific drug target.

SUMMARY
The tumor suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis
coli (APC) is mutated in most colorectal cancers
(CRCs), resulting in constitutive Wnt activation. To
understand the Wnt-activating mechanism of the
APC mutation, we applied CRISPR/Cas9 technology
to engineer various APC-truncated isogenic lines.
We find that the b-catenin inhibitory domain (CID) in
APC represents the threshold for pathological levels
of Wnt activation and tumor transformation. Mecha-
nistically, CID-deleted APC truncation promotes
b-catenin deubiquitination through reverse binding
of b-TrCP and USP7 to the destruction complex.
USP7 depletion in APC-mutated CRC inhibits Wnt
activation
by
restoring
b-catenin
ubiquitination,
drives differentiation, and suppresses xenograft
tumor growth. Finally, the Wnt-activating role of
USP7 is specific to APC mutations; thus, it can be
used as a tumor-specific therapeutic target for
most CRCs.
INTRODUCTION
The canonical Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway is evolutionarily
conserved and plays crucial roles in many biological processes,
such as stem cell maintenance and cell fate decision (Clevers
and Nusse, 2012). The key downstream modulator of the
pathway, b-catenin, is tightly regulated by phosphorylation and
ubiquitination-mediated degradation in the cytoplasmic b-cate-
nin destruction complex. The core of the destruction complex
consists of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), AXIN,
glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), and casein kinase 1 (CK1).
b-catenin is first phosphorylated by CK1 and GSK3, followed
by recruiting of the E3 ubiquitin ligase b-TrCP to the destruction
complex for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degra-
dation (Aberle et al., 1997; Kitagawa et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2002).
Aberrant Wnt activation has been associated with many
human cancer types, especially colorectal cancer (CRC) (Clevers
and Nusse, 2012; MacDonald et al., 2009; Vogelstein and
Kinzler, 2004). Mutations in Wnt pathway components are
frequently observed in CRC (Novellasdemunt et al., 2015). The
APC truncating mutation is the hallmark of the vast majority of
human CRCs. Its loss initiates adenoma formation through
constitutive Wnt activation (The Cancer Genome Atlas Network,
2012; Nagase and Nakamura, 1993). Most APC somatic muta-
tions occur in the ‘‘mutation cluster region’’ (MCR) between co-
dons 1,286 and 1,513 (Polakis, 1995; Vogelstein and Kinzler,
2004). Region-specific APC mutations have been associated
with distinct b-catenin transcriptional activity and tumor suscep-
tibility (Gaspar and Fodde, 2004). Different functional domains
have been described in the central region of the APC protein,
including the b-catenin-binding 15- and 20-amino-acid repeats
and the Axin-binding Ser-Ala-Met-Pro motif (SAMP) repeats
that are crucial for regulating b-catenin level. We have previously
shown that APC truncation activates Wnt/b-catenin signaling
through
abrogation
of
b-catenin
ubiquitination
within
the
destruction complex in CRCs, while assembly of the complex
is not affected (Li et al., 2012). However, the molecular mecha-
nism of how APC truncation inhibits b-catenin ubiquitination re-
mains elusive. Several studies have identified yet another highly
conserved regulatory domain in APC, the b-catenin inhibitory
domain (CID), which is located between the second and the third
20-amino-acid repeats (Kohler et al., 2009; Roberts et al., 2011).
The CID is believed to exert an essential role in downregulating
b-catenin levels and Wnt transcriptional activity. Importantly,
the CID locates right at the MCR that is lost in most human
CRCs, suggesting a functional and clinical significance. Despite
the crucial role of the CID in Wnt/b-catenin signaling regulation,
little is known about the underlying mechanism. APC CID has
been shown to interact with a-catenin to promote b-catenin
ubiquitination by stabilizing the association with APC as well as
to repress b-catenin/T cell factor (TCF) transcription in the nu-
cleus in wild-type APC cells (Choi et al., 2013). A more recent
study proposed another speculative model: GSK3-mediated
phosphorylation around the CID region promotes a conforma-
tional change in APC protein that allows the transfer of phos-
pho-b-catenin to the E3 ligase (Pronobis et al., 2015).
Protein ubiquitination-mediated degradation is a reversible
process that is tightly regulated by E3 ubiquitin ligases and deu-
biquitinating enzymes (DUBs). The role of DUBs in regulating
b-catenin ubiquitination is not well defined, particularly in the
context of CRC. Here, we sought to investigate the mechanistic
role of the APC mutation in b-catenin ubiquitination and Wnt

 activation. We find that the DUB enzyme USP7 is crucial in sus-
taining pathological, but not physiological, Wnt activation in
APC-truncated CRCs by mediating b-catenin deubiquitination.
RESULTS
CID Is the Critical Domain for Regulating Wnt Signaling
and b-Catenin Ubiquitination
To better understand the role of APC truncation in CRC, we first
generated various isogenic lines of APC truncating mutations
endogenously in wild-type (WT) HEK293T cells with intact Wnt
signaling cascade using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing
technique. Different APC truncating deletions (APC1–6) were
generated by targeting the central region of the APC protein
sequentially, as shown in Figure 1A (Table S1). A TOPFlash lucif-
erase assay revealed a dramatic upregulation in Wnt/TCF tran-
scription in the APC3 mutant when CID is lost (Figures 1A
and S1A). A gradual increase in Wnt signaling was observed
upon further truncation (compare APC3–6 in Figure 1A) and
confirmed by immunoblotting of APC and active (non-phosphor-
ylated) b-catenin in these mutants (Figures 1B and S1B). Wnt
activation of these APC mutants was further analyzed by qRT-
PCR of the endogenous Wnt target genes AXIN2 (Lustig et al.,
2002) and CCND1 (Tetsu and McCormick, 1999) (Figure S1C).
Consistently, significant upregulation of these Wnt target genes
was observed in APC3–6 mutants. CTNNB1 mRNA was
unchanged among the mutants, demonstrating that accumula-
tion of b-catenin protein occurs post-transcriptionally. Addition-
ally, we did not observe any changes of APC transcription,
except in APC6 where APC mRNA was reduced drastically.
This could be due to the instability of the short APC transcript,
as previously reported (Dihlmann et al., 1999). We further per-
formed endogenous AXIN1 immunoprecipitation (IP) in our
CRISPR-targeted APC mutant cells and confirmed the binding
of these truncated APC proteins to the destruction complex (Fig-
ure S1D). This is consistent with our previous findings that APC
truncation does not cause dissociation of the destruction com-
plex (Li et al., 2012).
Next, we examined the stability of b-catenin in these trun-
cated-APC cells. Significant b-catenin protein degradation was
detected at around the 2-hr time point after cycloheximine
(Chx) treatment in WT cells, while b-catenin was stabilized in
all CID-deleted mutants APC3–6, again with a gradual difference
between the various mutants (Figure 1C). Immunofluorescent
staining further illustrated the nuclear accumulation of the stabi-
lized b-catenin in these mutants (Figure 1C). Of note, the
CID-containing APC2 mutant showed moderate upregulation
of Wnt activity, yet without detectable nuclear accumulation of
b-catenin.
We have previously shown that APC mutations in CRC cells
abrogate Axin-bound b-catenin ubiquitination (Li et al., 2012).
Here, we examined the b-catenin ubiquitination state by immu-
noprecipitating the endogenous destruction complex in our
CRISPR-targeted APC mutants using AXIN1-specific antibody.
Cells were pre-treated with MG132 for 4 hr, followed by endog-
enous Axin1 IP-coupled western blot analysis. This allows us to
visualize the ubiquitinated forms of phosphorylated b-catenin in
the Axin pull-down by mobility shift. Consistent with our previous
data, suppression of b-catenin ubiquitination was observed in
the APC mutants, as revealed by immunoblotting of phospho-
b-catenin (S33/S37/T41) antibody (Figure 1D) and phospho-
insensitive total b-catenin antibody (Figure S1E). Specifically,
we observed a reduction of b-catenin ubiquitination (mobility
shift) upon the loss of CID (APC3), with almost-complete abroga-
tion of ubiquitination in the APC4 and APC5 mutants (Figure 1D).
Suppression of b-catenin ubiquitination upon APC truncation
was further confirmed by co-expressing Myc-Ubiquitin and
FLAG-b-catenin, followed by sequential double IP in WT and
APC4 cells (Figure S1F). Together, the data support the notion
that CID is the pivotal domain of APC to inhibit Wnt signaling
by regulating b-catenin ubiquitination.
A previous study proposed an alternative mechanism where
APC mutation exposes the N-terminal serine/threonine residues
of b-catenin to phosphatase for dephosphorylation (Su et al.,
2008). To determine whether b-catenin phosphorylation is
affected upon a single APC truncating mutation around the
MCR, we examined GSK3-mediated (S33/S37/T41) and CK1-
mediated (S45) b-catenin phosphorylation statuses in WT versus
APC2-5 cells in the absence of MG132. In contrast to the previ-
ous finding (Su et al., 2008), our data showed robust accumula-
tion of phosphorylated forms of b-catenin in APC3 and APC4
cells upon CID deletion, while phosphorylation was inhibited in
APC5 cells (Figure S1G). The result suggests that b-catenin
phosphorylation is only affected when all b-catenin binding mo-
tifs are lost in the APC protein (APC5), while phosphorylation is
still intact in the CID-loss APC mutations at the MCR (APC3
and APC4). Our APC CRISPR mutant isogenic cells provide
unique tools for direct quantitation of endogenous b-catenin
phosphorylation for the first time in a single APC mutation event.
Reciprocal Binding of b-TrCP and USP7 to the
b-Catenin-Destruction Complex upon APC Truncation
We then asked how b-catenin ubiquitination is inhibited when
APC is truncated. We hypothesized that CID regulates b-catenin

 ubiquitination by interacting with unknown ubiquitin-regulatory
proteins. To identify novel CID-bound ubiquitin-regulatory pro-
teins, we generated APC WT and CID-deleted (DCID) expression
constructs. To test their Wnt inhibitory roles, we expressed the
constructs in the APC mutant SW480 CRC cells (amino acid
[aa] 1338) and measured the Wnt transcriptional activity.
TopFlash luciferase assay showed that expression of APC
DCID failed to suppress Wnt activation in SW480 cells as
compared to APC WT (Figure 2A). IP-coupled western blot anal-
ysis further demonstrated that b-catenin ubiquitination was abol-
ished in APC DCID-expressing cells as revealed by mobility shift
(Figures 2B and S2A).
To examine the compositional differences of the b-catenin
destruction complex upon the loss of CID, WT and DCID APCs
were individually expressed in human HEK293T and mouse
L cells for tandem affinity purification (TAP) followed by mass
spectrometry (MS) analysis (Figure 2C). Intensity-based abso-
lute quantification (iBAQ) was used for label-free quantification.
Destruction complex components such as APC, AXIN1, b-cate-
nin, and casein kinases were readily detected in the IP com-
plexes. Protein candidates with differential interaction between
APC WT versus DCID in either cell line were shortlisted. To iden-
tify novel ubiquitin-regulatory proteins, we further shortlisted
interactors that are either E3-ubiquitin ligases or DUBs. This
resulted in seven protein candidates, among which only the
DUB enzyme USP7 (ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7) was de-
tected exclusively in the APC DCID complex in both cell lines
(Figures 2D and S2B).
Consistent with our MS data, we observed a significant
increased binding of USP7 to the destruction complex in the
CID-deleted APC mutants (APC3–5) as compared to the WT
and the CID-containing APC2 cells (Figures 2E and 2F). Inter-
estingly, an inverse interaction of the E3 ligase b-TrCP to the
destruction complex was observed, where binding was signifi-
cantly decreased in APC3–5 cells. We further confirmed such
mutually exclusive presence of USP7 and b-TrCP in an inde-
pendent experiment with different APC deletion constructs
with or without CID (Figures S2C and S2D). Of note, dissocia-
tion of b-TrCP to the destruction complex was robust but not
complete in the CID-deleted APC mutants (Figures 2B, 2E,
S2A, and S2D).
Based on our current data, we speculate that APC CID may,
indeed, function to protect b-catenin from binding to the DUB
enzyme USP7 in the destruction complex. Deletion of CID will
then expose b-catenin to USP7 for deubiquitination, leading to
subsequent b-catenin accumulation and aberrant Wnt activa-
tion. To test this hypothesis, we co-expressed FLAG-tagged
b-catenin and MYC-tagged USP7 in APC4 cells with or without
additional CID expression. b-catenin was pulled down using
FLAG antibody, and the binding of USP7 in the presence or
absence of CID was examined. Consistent with our hypothesis,
expression of CID, indeed, suppressed the binding of USP7 to
b-catenin (Figure S2E). Together, our data suggest that the
CID-loss APC mutation promotes b-catenin deubiquitination by
(1) reduced binding of the E3 ligase b-TrCP from the destruction
complex and (2) exposing b-catenin to the DUB enzyme USP7.
This led us to hypothesize the direct interaction between USP7
and b-catenin proteins.
USP7 Interacts with the N Terminus of b-Catenin
Directly to Mediate b-Catenin Deubiquitination
Next, we characterized whether b-catenin is the substrate of
USP7 for deubiquitination. We first confirmed the interaction be-
tween USP7 and b-catenin using endogenous IP in HEK293T
cells (Figures 3A and 3B). The binding of USP7 to the Axin1 com-
plex was significantly increased in APC4 mutant compared to
WT HEK293T cells (Figure S3A). A previous study suggested
that the interaction between USP7 and b-catenin was dependent
on another E3 ligase RNF220 (Ma et al., 2014). To validate
whether the binding of USP7 to the destruction complex requires
RNF220, we performed endogenous IP in both HEK293T and
APC mutated (APC4) cells using Axin1-specific antibody. In
contrast to the reported data, we were unable to detect
RNF220 in the endogenous Axin destruction complex (Fig-
ure S3A). To further confirm that the USP7 interaction is
RNF220 independent, we CRISPR-targeted RNF220 in APC4
cells and repeated endogenous Axin1 IP (Figure S3B). USP7
was detected in the Axin1-pull-down complex in both RNF220-
proficient and -deficient cells (Figure S3C). Our results imply
that the increased binding of USP7 to the destruction complex
upon APC mutation is RNF220 independent.
To map the USP7 binding site on b-catenin, we generated a
b-catenin 26-mer overlapping peptide array with one residue
offset. The array was then probed with USP7 recombinant pro-
tein or control to identify specific binding signal. Two potential
USP7 binding sites were detected on the N terminus of b-catenin
(Figure 3C). To validate the USP7 binding, we synthesized the
two b-catenin peptides identified from the array with N-terminal
biotin labeling for IP analysis. Our results confirmed the direct
interaction of USP7 to the two identified b-catenin peptide re-
gions (Figures 3D and S3D). Interestingly, the first peptide region
(aas 28–53) covers the GSK3 (Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41) and CK1
(Ser45) phosphorylation sites, while the second region (aas
70–97) covers another reported modification site, Tyr86 (Tomi-
naga et al., 2008). Motif analysis confirmed a b-TrCP binding
motif (aas 32–37; DSGIHS) and revealed a USP7 binding motif
(aas 44–47; PSLS) in the first detected peptide (Figure 3E) (Sheng
et al., 2006). To validate whether ‘‘PSLS’’ is the USP7 binding
motif on b-catenin, we mutated the consensus serine residue
(Ser47) on b-catenin (i.e., ‘‘PSLS’’ to ‘‘PSLA’’) and examined
the interaction with USP7. IP-coupled western blotting demon-
strated a significantly weaker interaction between USP7 and
b-catenin S47A mutant protein as compared to the wild-type
b-catenin (Figures 3F and 3G). We further generated the b-cate-
nin Y86A mutant to test the second putative USP7 binding
region. Pull-down of b-catenin Y86A also showed a moderate
decrease
in
binding
to
the
USP7
protein
(Figures
S3E
and S3F), although the decrease was not as significant as in
the S47A mutant. Of note, the close proximity of both USP7
and the b-TrCP binding motif on the N terminus of b-catenin sug-
gests a potential competition of substrate between the two
enzymes.
Finally, we tested whether b-catenin is the direct substrate
of USP7 by generating a catalytic inactive mutant of USP7
C223A (Hu et al., 2002). Expression of WT USP7 robustly sup-
pressed b-catenin ubiquitination, as demonstrated by mobility
shift, while the C223A mutant expression failed to execute its

 function (Figures 3H and S3G). An in vitro deubiquitination assay
further confirmed that b-catenin is the direct substrate of USP7
(Figure S3H). Together, our data imply that USP7 interacts with
the N terminus of b-catenin directly to mediate b-catenin deubi-
quitination when APC is mutated.
USP7 Depletion in APC-Truncated CRC Cells
Suppresses Aberrant Wnt Activation by Restoring
b-Catenin Ubiquitination
Our current data support a model in which APC truncation acti-
vates Wnt signaling by exposing the destruction-complex-
bound b-catenin to the DUB enzyme USP7 for deubiquitination.
To test whether this process is reversible, we depleted USP7 in
the APC mutant cell line (APC4) using CRISPR/Cas9 gene target-
ing. Wnt activation of APC4 cells was significantly suppressed
upon USP7 mutation (Figures 4A and S4A–S4C). Interestingly,
we were not able to obtain stable knockout (KO) of USP7 effi-
ciently in APC4 cells. Transient targeting of USP7 in APC4 cells
immediately after transfection significantly suppressed Wnt tran-
scriptional activity, while such suppression was gradually lost
upon colony picking (Figure S4B). We reasoned that USP7
depletion in APC mutant cells might have a growth disadvantage
and may, therefore, be rapidly replaced by USP7 WT cells upon
passaging. Indeed, the USP7 targeted cells grew much more
slowly than the non-targeted cells. USP7 has been previously
described in the p53/Mdm2 pathway to regulate p53-dependent
apoptosis (Li et al., 2002; Meulmeester et al., 2005). To prove that
the USP7-mediated Wnt activation is p53 independent, we
further targeted USP7 in the APC-mutated CRC cell line
SW480 carrying the p53 mutation. Similar to the APC4 cells,
we were not able to obtain complete USP7 KO in SW480 cells
(Figure S4D). Transient targeting of USP7 in SW480 cells showed
robust suppression of USP7 protein and Wnt activation, while
the USP7-depleted cells were rapidly lost upon passaging and
colony picking (Figures S4E and S4F). Despite the incomplete
USP7 depletion, a significant suppression in Wnt signaling was
observed usinig TopFlash luciferase and Wnt target gene tran-
scription (Figures 4B and S4G). The results showed that USP7-
mediated Wnt activation in CRC is a reversible process. The
rapid loss of USP7-depleted cells suggests that USP7 might
be essential for the survival of APC mutant cells.
To test whether USP7 is also important in physiological Wnt
activation, we CRISPR targeted USP7 in WT HEK293T cells
with intact APC and measured the TopFlash luciferase activity
upon Wnt3A induction. In contrast to APC4 and SW480 cells,
complete KO of USP7 could be generated easily in the WT
HEK293T cells (Figure S4H; Table S2). Surprisingly, we did not
observe any changes in Wnt activation, despite the complete
USP7 KO (Figure 4C). Our data suggest that USP7 is essential
to sustain pathological Wnt activation in APC mutants but not
physiological Wnt activation in normal cells.
We next tested whether USP7 depletion in APC-mutated cells
was able to rescue b-catenin ubiquitination. Indeed, CRISPR tar-
geting of USP7 in the CID-deleted APC4 cells readily restored
b-catenin ubiquitination in the destruction complex (Figures 4D
and S4I). To further demonstrate that the ubiquitination event is
b-catenin specific, we co-transfected His-tagged ubiquitin and
FLAG-tagged b-catenin in APC4 cells with or without USP7
depletion for double IP. Western blot analysis of the His pull-
down samples showed significantly more ubiquitinated b-cate-
nin in APC4 cells after USP7 depletion, as shown by the shift
of higher molecular weight forms of b-catenin (Figure S4J).
Consistent with our IP and TopFlash luciferase data, b-catenin
protein degradation was significantly accelerated when USP7
was depleted in APC4 cells (Figures 4E and S4K). We concluded
that USP7 is essential in mediating b-catenin deubiquitination
and aberrant Wnt activation upon APC truncation.
Next, we examined whether USP7 deletion affects cell prolifer-
ation and survival. Clonogenic assays were performed in Caco2,
SW480, APC4, and HEK293T cells with or without USP7 CRISPR
targeting. Depletion of USP7 in Caco2, SW480, and APC4 cells
significantly suppressed colony formation in comparison to the
parental cells (Figures 4F and 4G). In contrast, USP7 KO in WT
HEK293T cells did not show any effect on cell growth. To further
validate that the growth suppression of USP7 depletion in APC
mutants is, indeed, due to Wnt/b-catenin signaling, we intro-
duced a stabilized form of b-catenin (Ser33Y mutant) in the
APC4 and Caco2 cells upon USP7 CRISPR targeting. b-Catenin
(Ser33Y) expression significantly rescued the number of colonies
formed as well as the Wnt transcriptional activity mediated by
USP7 CRISPR mutation in both cells (Figures 4H and S4L), sug-
gesting that the growth defect upon USP7 loss is due to modu-
lation of Wnt signaling. Our data support the notion that USP7
plays a crucial role in Wnt signal activation and cell survival, spe-
cifically in APC truncated cells.
To further test whether USP7 also regulates Wnt signaling in
non-APC-mutated CRC, we depleted USP7 in another CRC
cell line, HCT116, carrying WT APC and heterozygous b-catenin
Ser45 deletion (Figure S4M). Similar to the WT HEK293T cells,
CRISPR targeting of USP7 in HCT116 cells did not suppress
Wnt activation (Figure 4I). We further interrogated the cell line
by introducing an additional APC mutation using CRISPR

 targeting (HCT116 APCCRISPR). Unlike the parental cell line,
USP7 depletion in HCT116 APCCRISPR cells showed significant
Wnt suppression (Figure 4J). We performed similar experiments
in
HCT116-p53
null
cells
and
observed
similar
results
(Figures 4K, S4N, and S4O). Of note, we were not able to obtain
complete APC KO in the USP7-depleted HCT116 cells for the
same growth disadvantage reason as that observed in APC4
and SW480 cells, confirming that USP7 is essential for cell sur-
vival in APC-mutated cells. Collectively, we concluded that the
USP7-mediated b-catenin deubiquitination and Wnt activation
are specific to CRCs carrying APC mutations and are p53
independent.
Targeting USP7 with Small-Molecule Inhibitors
Suppresses Wnt Activation in CRCs Carrying CID-
Deleted APC Mutations
Our current data indicate that USP7 is a potential tumor-specific
drug target for APC-mutated CRCs by altering the Wnt signaling
pathway. Several USP7 inhibitors have been previously devel-
oped to target the p53/Mdm2 pathway, while their roles in the
Wnt signaling pathway have not been addressed (Fan et al.,
2013; Reverdy et al., 2012). Here, we examined the effect of
the USP7-specific inhibitor HBX19818 on Wnt signaling in CRC
cells (Reverdy et al., 2012). Treatment of the CRISPR-targeted
APC4 cells with HBX19818 showed a marked reduction in Wnt
activation (Figure 5A). Similar results were obtained in CRC cells
carrying CID-deleted APC mutations (SW480 and Caco-2) (Fig-
ures 5B and 5C). Significant suppression of Wnt target gene tran-
scription was also confirmed in APC4 after HBX19818 treatment
(Figure 5D).
To validate whether the function of USP7 is specific to CID
loss, we further examined the effect of HBX19818 on the
different CRISPR-targeted isogenic APC mutants. Consistent
with our hypothesis, Wnt signaling was significantly suppressed
in the CID-deleted APC3 and APC5 cells but not in the CID-con-
taining APC2 cells upon inhibitor treatment (Figures 5E–5G).
Similarly, CRC cells carrying WT APC (HCT116) or CID partly
containing APC mutation (DLD1) and WT HEK293T treated
with HBX19818 did not suppress Wnt activation (Figures 5H,
5I, and S5A). A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazo-
lium bromidefor (MTT) assay further revealed that HBX19818-
treated cells showed significantly reduced cell viability in the
APC-truncated
cells
when
compared
to
HEK293T
cells
(Figure 5J).
To validate the Wnt suppression effect, we further tested
another reported USP7-specific inhibitor, P22077 (Fan et al.,
2013). Similar to HBX19818, P22077 treatment demonstrated a
dose-dependent Wnt suppression in the APC-truncated APC4
and SW480 cells but not in the WT APC HEK293T or HCT116
cells (Figures S5B–S5E). Significant suppression of Wnt target
gene transcription was also confirmed in APC4 cells after
P22077 treatment (Figure S5F). An MTT assay further confirmed
that P22077-treated cells significantly inhibited the cell viability
of the APC-truncated cells as compared to HEK293T cells at
the equivalent dose (Figure S5G).
In summary, USP7 inhibition by CRISPR targeting or treatment
with two different small molecules consistently suppresses aber-
rant Wnt activation in CID-loss APC mutant cells. Our data high-
light the potential of USP7 as a tumor-specific drug target for
CRCs carrying CID-deleted APC mutations.
Inactivation of Usp7 in Apc-Mutated Intestinal
Organoids Promotes Differentiation and Suppresses
Growth
Next, we studied the functional significance of Usp7 in ex vivo in-
testinal organoid culture (Sato et al., 2009). We first engineered
different APC truncations in organoids using the CRISPR/Cas9
technique and compared their growth upon functional selection
(Figure 6A; Table S3). Organoids derived from tumors isolated
from Apcmin/+ mice were used as positive controls (Sato et al.,
2011). Normal intestinal organoids that are cultured in a previ-
ously described medium (ENR) will form a budding structure
with multi-lineage differentiation, while organoids with Apc
depletion will turn into tumor-like ‘‘spheroids’’ that are hyperpro-
liferative and extracellular Wnt signal independent and that lack
differentiation (Dow et al., 2015; Drost et al., 2015). Similar to the
Apcmin/+ organoids, all three engineered Apc mutant organoids
showed spheroid morphology (Figure 6B, top panel). We asked
whether our engineered Apc mutant organoids are dependent
on exogenous Wnt signal by R-spondin withdrawal (Schwank
et al., 2013) or treatment with porcupine inhibitor (which blocks
Wnt ligand secretion) (Chen et al., 2009). Both WT and CID-con-
taining Apc2 organoids died after exogenous Wnt depletion,
whereas the CID-deleted Apc3, Apc5, and Apcmin/+ organoids
could be maintained as spheroids in the culture (Figure 6B).
Taken together with our CRISPR-engineered cell line data, the
results support the notion that CID is the critical threshold in
APC for the pathological level of Wnt activation and tumor
transformation.
To determine whether Usp7 is essential in maintaining
tumor-like spheroid growth in Apc-mutant organoids, we deleted
Usp7 in Apc5 organoids by CRISPR targeting. Usp7 depletion

 prominently reversed the spheroid phenotype in Apc5 that
showed recovery of organoid sprouting—evidence of normal dif-
ferentiation (Figures 6C, 6D, and S6A; Table S3). Wnt signaling
was also significantly suppressed upon Usp7 mutation (Fig-
ure S6B). Similar to the cell line data, we were not able to main-
tain Usp7 KO in Apc5 organoids. Indeed, the Usp7 KO-induced
sprouting phenotype was rapidly lost upon passaging, suggest-
ing the growth disadvantage of these cells upon Usp7 loss (Fig-
ure S6C). Despite the incomplete KO, inhibition of Usp7 in Apc5
organoids resulted in significant growth suppression (Figures 6E,
S6D, and S6E) and cellular differentiation (Figures 6F and S6F).
Importantly, CRISPR-targeted Usp7 mutation in WT organoids
did not show any significant effect, which is consistent with the
tumor-specific role we observed in CRC cell lines (Figures S6G
and S6H; Table S3). Together, our data suggest that USP7 can
be used as a tumor-specific therapeutic target to suppress
tumor growth and induce cellular differentiation via Wnt
inactivation.
USP7 Depletion Significantly Inhibits APC-Mutated CRC
Tumor Growth In Vivo
To confirm the therapeutic role of USP7 in CRC, we further
studied the effect of USP7 inhibition in vivo using a xenograft
model. Colon cancer SW480 cells were injected subcutane-
ously into the flank of SCID mice. USP7 inhibitor P22077 or
vehicle control (DMSO) was administered at 30 mg/kg daily
by intraperitoneal injections (Fan et al., 2013). Treatment of
the mice with P22077 significantly suppressed tumor growth
compared to vehicle treatment (Figures 7A and 7B). Mice
treated with P22077 did not show any detectable health prob-
lems or weight loss (Figure S7A). Histological analysis of the
intestine from the P22077-treated mice also showed no signif-
icant difference compared to the control animals (Figure S7B).
In addition, tumor material isolated from the P22077-treated
mice showed suppression of Wnt target genes (Figure S7C).
The data suggest that USP7 inhibitors can be used for treat-
ment of APC-mutated CRC by suppressing pathological Wnt
activation.
To validate the tumor-suppressive effect of USP7 inhibitors,
we repeated the xenograft experiment by comparing tumor
growth between the parental and USP7 CRISPR-targeted
SW480 cells (Figure S7D). Consistent with the inhibitor data,
USP7 depletion significantly inhibited tumor growth, compared
to the parental SW480 tumors (Figures 7C and 7D) with reduced
Wnt target gene expression (Figure S7E).
We further tested whether the tumor-suppressive effect is p53
dependent by comparing the effect of Usp7 depletion in our
CRISPR-engineered HCT116 cell line carrying an additional
APC mutation (HCT116 APCCRISPR) in both p53 WT and null
backgrounds. Strikingly, the HCT116 APCCRISPR USP7CRISPR
cells demonstrated remarkable suppression in tumor growth
when compared to the HCT116 APCCRISPR cells (Figures 7E
and 7F). To confirm that the USP7-mediated tumor suppression
is p53 independent, we compared the xenograft tumor growth
between HCT116 p53�/� APCCRISPR and HCT116 p53�/�
APCCRISPR USP7CRISPR cells. Consistently, USP7 depletion
dramatically suppressed tumor growth in the HCT116 p53�/�
background (Figures 7G and 7H). In summary, our findings sug-
gest that USP7 is a promising tumor-specific target for treatment
of APC-mutated CRC by targeting pathological Wnt activation.
DISCUSSION
The connection between the Wnt signaling pathway and CRC
was first identified in the early 1990s. Both somatic and germline
mutations of APC were discovered in CRC patients in 1991 (Gro-
den et al., 1991; Joslyn et al., 1991; Kinzler et al., 1991; Nishisho
et al., 1991), while the interaction between APC and b-catenin
was found 2 years after (Rubinfeld et al., 1993; Su et al., 1993).
Despite extensive research on Wnt signaling and CRC over the
past 20 years, clinically approved drugs targeting Wnt signaling
in APC mutation cancer do not exist. The major hurdle of thera-
peutic development of Wnt pathway inhibitors rests in its essen-
tial role in adult tissue homeostasis. Drugging Wnt signaling will
inevitably cause toxicity to Wnt-dependent normal tissue devel-
opment such as in the intestine, thus limiting the full antitumor
efficacy. Development of tumor-specific Wnt inhibitor would
circumvent this challenge.
In this study, we identified USP7 as a tumor-specific target
by characterizing the fundamental Wnt-activating mechanism
of APC mutation. Most previous studies on APC and the Wnt
pathway relied heavily on ectopic overexpression of various
APC mutant proteins in non-physiological doses. None of these
experiments can faithfully recapitulate the endogenous molec-
ular changes upon a single, specific APC mutation in a ma-
mmalian cell. Here, we engineered various endogenous APC
truncations in WT isogenic cell lines and intestinal organoids
using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and revealed the func-
tional significance of the CID domain in APC as the critical
threshold for pathological Wnt activation and tumor formation.
Our data show that CID-lacking APC truncation results in Wnt
pathway activation by facilitating binding of the DUB enzyme
USP7—at the cost of binding of the E3 ligase b-TrCP—to the
destruction complex for b-catenin deubiquitination. Inactivation
of USP7, either by CRISPR mutation or by small-molecule in-
hibitors, suppresses APC-mutated CRC tumor growth and
Wnt activation by restoring b-catenin ubiquitination. Impor-
tantly, USP7 inhibition does not affect normal cells with WT
APC, indicating that USP7 can be used as a tumor-specific
drug target for APC-mutated CRCs. Additional in vivo ex-
periments using USP7 floxed mice in combination with an
Apc-mutated tumor model will be crucial to confirm the
tumor-suppressive effect upon USP7 depletion in the intestine.
Our current data further imply a critical role of APC CID in

 regulating b-catenin ubiquitination by protecting b-catenin from
interacting with the DUB enzyme USP7. Ubiquitination of other
proteins in the destruction complex, such as AXIN and APC,
has been previously reported (Tran et al., 2013; Zhang et al.,
2011). It would be interesting to further examine whether
USP7 can target other proteins in the destruction complex
apart from b-catenin.
Thus far, only two studies have attempted to examine the role
of USP7 in Wnt signaling. The first study showed that USP7 is not
involved in Wnt signaling based on short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
screening in HEK293T cells (Tauriello and Maurice, 2010).
Another group recently proposed, using a small interfering
RNA (siRNA) knockdown strategy, that USP7 enhances Wnt
signaling through RNF220-dependent b-catenin deubiquitina-
tion (Ma et al., 2014), which is inconsistent with our current find-
ings. In fact, our data are consistent with the previous finding that
USP7 depletion does not affect physiological Wnt activation. We
show that USP7-mediated b-catenin deubiquitination is a tumor-
specific event when APC is truncated and that it is RNF220 inde-
pendent. Our data not only clarify the tumor-specific role of
USP7 in Wnt signaling but also highlight the importance of devel-
oping physiological experimental models such as CRISPR-engi-
neered mutations for molecular and functional studies. Of note,
our current data do not completely exclude the role of USP7 in
physiological Wnt regulation. In fact, recent studies have re-
ported the roles of other DUB enzymes such as CYLD, USP47,
and USP6 in physiological Wnt regulation (Madan et al., 2016;
Shi et al., 2015; Tauriello and Maurice, 2010). It is, therefore,
possible that USP7 inhibition alone does not affect physiological
Wnt signaling due to redundancy. Further investigation will be
needed to delineate the potential unique or redundant roles of
these DUB enzymes in physiological and pathological Wnt
regulation.
Previous studies have identified other proteins as potential
substrates of the DUB enzyme USP7 (Nicholson and Suresh Ku-
mar, 2011). The tumor suppressor gene p53 was first identified
as the primary substrate of USP7 for deubiquitination and stabi-
lization (Li et al., 2002). Subsequent studies further described the
USP7-mediated deubiquitination of the E3 ligases of p53,
Mdm2/HDM2 (the human ortholog of Mdm2), and its homolog
HDMX, suggesting a dynamic role of USP7 in regulating the
p53/Mdm2 pathway (Li et al., 2004; Meulmeester et al., 2005).
To address whether the Wnt-activating role of USP7 is p53
dependent, we tested CRC cells with the p53 mutation (SW480
and HCT116 p53�/�). Our results clearly demonstrated that
USP7-mediated b-catenin deubiquitination is p53 independent.
We confirmed that targeting USP7 can suppress tumor growth
in vivo by inhibiting Wnt activation. To our knowledge, this is
the first intervention against USP7 in CRC in vivo in the context
of the Wnt signaling pathway.
Given the critical role in regulating both p53/Mdm2 and Wnt/
b-catenin signaling, USP7 holds great promise as a therapeutic
target for cancer treatment. Our current findings have added sig-
nificant implications to the development and application of USP7
inhibitors in the clinic. The fact that we were not able to obtain
complete USP7 KO in APC-mutated CRC cells indicates the
essential role of USP7 in cancer cell survival. On the other
hand, incomplete KO of USP7 was sufficient to inhibit Wnt
signaling and suppress tumor growth. Our data echo a recent
study showing that minimal APC restoration is sufficient for tu-
mor suppression (Dow et al., 2015). This further implies a prom-
ising safe and efficient therapeutic window of USP7 inhibitors for
cancer treatment. Identifying the target population is a critical
step for developing a successful drug with high efficacy. Our
data suggest that USP7 inhibitors can be used for treatment of
CID-deleted APC mutated CRCs, as well as for potential preven-
tive therapy for FAP patients carrying germline APC mutations,
by delaying cancer onset. Since the Wnt-activating role of
USP7 is tumor specific and p53 independent, drugs targeting
USP7 can potentially be used to treat CRC patients with APC
mutations, regardless of p53 status. However, we believe that
USP7 inhibitor treatment will be more effective in patients car-
rying the APC mutation and WT p53 due to the synergistic effect
of Wnt signal suppression and p53 stabilization. Further studies
on the structural interaction between USP7 and b-catenin, as
well as the conformational changes of the APC protein upon
the CID loss, may aid the development of improved Wnt-specific
USP7 inhibitors.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell Culture, Transfection, and TOPFlash Assay
HEK293T, SW480, DLD1, HCT116, and Caco-2 cells were maintained in
DMEM GlutaMAX (GIBCO) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
(GIBCO) and with 100 U/mL penicillin (GIBCO) and 100 mg/mL streptomycin
(GIBCO). All cells were maintained at 37�C in an incubator with 5% CO2. Cells
were seeded in plates 24 hr before transfection, and plasmids were trans-
fected using polyethylenimine (Polysciences) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. For the TOPFlash luciferase assay, cells in a 48-well plate were
transfected with 100 ng of the reporter plasmid TOP or FOP and 10 ng of
TK/Renilla for each well. 100 ng of additional plasmid was cotransfected in
each well when indicated. After 16 hr of transfection, cells were treated with
Wnt3a-conditioned medium (when indicated) or control medium or with
USP7 inhibitor treatment or DMSO for an additional 18 hr. The luciferase activ-
ity was measured using a luminometer. For transfections for IP, cells were also
seeded 24 hr before transfection in a 10- or 15-cm plate, and 7–15 mg plasmid
