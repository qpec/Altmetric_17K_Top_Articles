Despite improvements in drug and device therapy for heart failure, hospitalization rates and mortality have
changed little in the past decade. Randomized clinical trials using gene transfer to improve function of the
failing heart are the focus of this review. Four randomized clinical trials of gene transfer in heart failure with
reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) have been published. Each enrolled patients with stable symptomatic
HFrEF and used either intracoronary delivery of a virus vector or endocardial injection of a plasmid. The
initial CUPID trial randomized 14 subjects to placebo and 25 subjects to escalating doses of adeno-associated
virus type 1 encoding sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (AAV1.SERCA2a). AAV1.SERCA2a was well
tolerated, and the high-dose group met a 6 month composite endpoint. In the subsequent CUPID-2 study, 243
subjects received either placebo or the high dose of AAV1.SERCA2a. AAV1.SERCA2a administration, while
safe, failed to meet the primary or any secondary endpoints. STOP-HF used plasmid endocardial injection of
stromal cell-derived factor-1 to promote stem-cell recruitment. In a 93-subject trial of patients with ischemic
etiology heart failure, the primary endpoint (symptoms and 6 min walk distance) failed, but subgroup ana-
lyses showed improvements in subjects with the lowest ejection fractions. A fourth trial randomized 14
subjects to placebo and 42 subjects to escalating doses of adenovirus-5 encoding adenylyl cyclase 6 (Ad5.hAC6).
There were no safety concerns, and patients in the two highest dose groups (combined) showed improvements
in left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction and –dP/dt). The safety data from four ran-
domized clinical trials of gene transfer in patients with symptomatic HFrEF suggest that this approach can be
conducted with acceptable risk, despite invasive delivery techniques in a high-risk population. Additional
trials are necessary before the approach can be endorsed for clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION
HEART FAILURE (HF) AFFECTS six million patients in
the United States.1 Although there has been some
reduction in the HF admission rate and mortality
in the last 10 years, the prognosis and burden of HF
remains unacceptably high. New therapies are
needed, which is the rationale for considering new
approaches such as gene transfer.
Although many preclinical studies have shown
benefits of gene transfer in animal models of
HF, few have been translated to randomized clin-
ical trials. The attraction of gene transfer is its
simplicity—a one-time administration offers the
possibility of safely providing benefits beyond
standard pharmacological and device therapy in
this devastating disease with high morbidity and
mortality.
Genetransfertoimprovethefunctionofthefailing
heart in patients with HF with reduced ejection
fraction (HFrEF) has now been performed in four
randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Three
strategies have been employed: (1) intracoronary

ing sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (AAV1

 .SERCA2a); (2) endocardial injection of a plasmid
encoding stromal cell-derived factor-1 (pSDF-1); and
(3) IC delivery of adenovirus-5 encoding adenylyl
cyclase type 6 (Ad5.hAC6). These approaches, used in
four randomized clinical trials, are the focus of this
review.
METHODS
PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov (without lan-
guage restrictions) were searched for clinical trials
published between January 1990 and October
2016, using the search terms ‘‘gene transfer’’ (and
‘‘gene therapy’’) and ‘‘heart failure’’ and related
terms. Only four randomized clinical trials testing
gene transfer in patients with HF were found,
confirming that gene transfer for clinical HF is in
its infancy. These four trials are summarized by
providing the rationale for transgene selection,
important preclinical or nonrandomized clinical
trials, safety, and results. Finally, the results of the
studies are summarized and perspectives are pro-
vided for future work in this area.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The CUPID2 and CUPID-23 trials used IC de-
livery of AAV1.SERCA2a. SERCA2a is a cardiac
Ca2+ regulating protein. CUPID-2 used simul-
taneous intravenous infusion of nitroglycerine
during IC vector delivery. The STOP-HF4 clinical
trial used endocardial injection of pSDF-1 to pro-
mote stem-cell recruitment and tissue repair, in-
cluding angiogenesis in patients with HFrEF of
ischemic etiology. Finally, a fourth randomized
clinical trial used IC delivery of an adenovirus-5
vector encoding adenylyl cyclase 6 (Ad5.hAC6).5
The AC6 gene transfer trial used simultaneous IC
infusion of sodium nitroprusside during IC vector
delivery (Table 1).
CUPID and CUPID-2 (AAV1.SERCA2a)
Preliminary preclinical and non-randomized clini-
cal studies.
SERCA2a is a Ca2+ regulating pro-
tein on cardiac myocytes. Isolated cardiac myocytes
from patients with HF have reduced expression
and activity of SERCA2a and reduced shortening,
abnormalities that are rectified by SERCA2a gene
transfer.6 Intracoronary delivery of AAV1.SER-
CA2a (1012 DNAase resistant particles, drp) in pigs
with volume overload was beneficial and was as-
sociated with increased cardiac SERCA2a expres-
sion.7 In an initial open-label clinical trial (not
randomized), nine subjects with stable symptom-
atic HFrEF (EF £30%) received IC AAV1.SER-

 CA2a (1.4 · 1011, 6 · 1011, or · 1012 drp). Follow-up
for 12 months after infusion showed no serious
adverse events and evidence of improvement in
symptoms, exercise, left ventricular (LV) function,
and biomarkers.8 These data were the basis for two
subsequent randomized clinical trials.
CUPID
The CUPID trial2 was a Phase 2 blinded,
randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study
examining the effects of AAV1.SERCA2a in 39
subjects with stable symptomatic HFrEF (EF £35%),
maximal oxygen consumption £20 mL/kg/min, and
an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).
Fourteen participants received IC placebo, and 25
received IC AAV1.SERCA2a, at doses of 6 · 1011
(n = 8), 3 · 1012 (n = 8), or 3 · 1013 (n = 9) drp. Sub-
jects were screened to exclude those with detect-
able neutralizing antibodies against AAV1. The
trial used five efficacy domains: symptoms, func-
tional (6 min walk distance and peak oxygen con-
sumption), biomarker, LV volume and ejection
fraction, and clinical outcomes, which included
seven different endpoints.
Safety in CUPID.
IC AAV1.SERCA2a was well
tolerated, with no untoward effects attributed to
the vector or transgene 1 year later. The incidence
of serious and non-serious adverse events was
highest in the subjects who received placebo and
lowest in those who received the highest dose of
AAV1.SERCA2a. There was no evidence of cellular
immune response to the vector. There were eight
deaths: four in the placebo group, three in the low-
dose, one in the mid-dose, and none in the high-
dose groups. The differences in mortality were not
significant (Table 2).
Efficacy in CUPID.
The 6 month primary end-
point was achieved in all three of the pre-specified
analyses for the AAV1.SERCA2a high-dose group,
including the group-level analysis in functional
(6MWT, p=0.14) and LV function/remodeling (End-

domains,
the
individual-level analysis (p=0.052), and the outcome
endpoint (using duration of cardiovascular hospital-
izations, p=0.08). The clinical event rate in all three
AAV1.SERCA2a groups was delayed or reduced
compared with placebo subjects. The hazard ratios
(HR) at 12 months for recurrent clinical events (ad-
justed for correlated terminal events) for the low-,
mid-, and high-dose AAV1.SERCA2a groups versus
placebo were 0.40 (p=0.11), 0.44 ( p=0.12), and 0.12
(p=0.003), respectively (Table 2).

(Table 1). Randomized patients had 50% non-
ischemic etiology, and 77% had an ICD. Patients
were randomized 1:1 to receive IC infusion of placebo
(n = 122)orAAV1.SERCA2a(n =121)atadoseof1013
drp.The study product was delivered in proportion to
myocardium perfused, targeting two-thirds of the
dose to the anterolateral wall, and intravenous ni-
troglycerin was infused during test article delivery.
The primary efficacy endpoint was time to recurrent
events, defined as hospital admission because of HF
or ambulatory treatment for worsening HF. After
observing a lower event rate than anticipated in the
first 101 patients, additional inclusion criteria of el-
evated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide
(NT-proBNP) or a recent HF-related hospital ad-
mission were added to the protocol.
Safety in CUPID-2.
No group differences in
serious adverse events were seen. There were 262
clinical events in the placebo group and 190 events
in the AAV1.SERCA2a group, most of which were
admission to hospital. Death occurred in 16% of
subjects in the placebo group (18/20 deaths were of
cardiovascular origin) and in 21% of the subjects in
the AAV1.SERCA2a group (22/25 deaths were of
cardiovascular origin) (Table 2).
Efficacy in CUPID-2.
Patients were followed for
at least 12 months after randomization (median
18 months). AAV1.SERCA2a did not improve time
to recurrent events compared to placebo (104 vs.
128 events; HR = 0.93, p = 0.81). There were 104
recurrent and 36 terminal events reported in the
AAV1.SERCA2a group compared to 128 recurrent
and 29 terminal events in the placebo group. Most
of the recurrent events were admission to hospital
because of HF. There were no group differences in
the primary endpoint or any of the secondary or
exploratory efficacy endpoints (change in NYHA
class, 6min walk distance, symptoms, or NT-proBNP
level). Nonstandard statistical methods were used
for the CUPID study, and this may have contrib-
uted to the disparity in results between CUPID
and CUPID 2 (Table 2).
STOP-HF
Preliminary preclinical and nonrandomized clinical
studies.
SDF-1 is a factor that activates endoge-
nous stem cells, which facilitates tissue repair
particularly through vasculogenesis.9,10 The au-
thors rationale was to use gene transfer of a DNA
plasmid encoding human SDF-1 (pSDF-1) to in-
crease tissue repair pathways including myocar-
dial vasculogenesis and thereby improve function
of the failing ischemic heart. Indeed, their group
had shown in a pig HF model that endocardial in-
jection of pSDF-1 increased cardiac function and
vasculogenesis 90 days after delivery.10
This strategy differs from the others reviewed in
three ways. First, SDF-1, unlike SERCA2a and
AC6, is a cytokine that has no direct effects on
cardiac function, but operates via stimulating en-
dogenous repair processes including angiogenesis.
Second, a plasmid vector rather than a virus vector
is used. Third, delivery is by direct injection into
the heart rather than by IC delivery.
In an initial nonrandomized, open-label clinical
trial,11 17 subjects with symptomatic ischemia-
based HFrEF (EF <40%) and an ICD received one
of three doses (5, 15, or 30 mg) of pSDF-1 delivered
via endocardial catheter-based injection (15 injec-
tions of equally divided amounts of pSDF-1 per
patient). There was no placebo control in this initial
trial, but improvements in 6 min walk distance and
symptoms were seen in the groups that received
15 mg (n = 6) and 30 mg (n = 7) of pSDF-1. There
were some procedure-related adverse events that
were deemed to be at an acceptably low rate.
The STOP-HF trial4 was a Phase 2 blinded,
placebo-controlled, multicenter study in which 93
subjects with ischemic etiology stable symptomatic
HFrEF(EF<40%)andanICDwererandomized1:1:1
to receive endocardial catheter-based injection of
placebo or 15 or 30mg of pSDF-1 (Table 1). The pri-
mary endpoint was a composite of symptoms (Min-
nesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire) and
6min walk distance evaluated before and 4 months
after randomization. Echocardiography was used to
assess LV dimensions and function, which were sec-
ondary endpoints. Enrollees had a mean EF of
28–7%, and were 11–9 months out from myocardial
infarction.
Safety in STOP-HF.
There were no product-
related
unanticipated
serious
adverse
events
among the 62 patients randomized to receive
pSDF-1 (Table 2).
Efficacy in STOP-HF.
The primary endpoint of
the trial was not met ( p = 0.89), as the composite
score of the 6 min walk distance and symptoms
was increased in both placebo and treated cohorts
4 months after randomization. However, a pre-
specified analysis indicated that patients with the
lowest tertile of EF who received the higher dose of
pSDF-1 (30 mg) showed a 7% unit increase in EF
compared with a 4% unit decrease in EF among
placebo patients at 12 months ( p = 0.01). The au-
thors concluded that although the primary end-
RCT GENE TRANSFER HFrEF
381
 point was not met, endocardial injection of pSDF-1
was safe and possibly effective in patients with the
lowest EF, which may be the target population in
subsequent trials (Table 2).
AC6 gene transfer trial
AC6 is a large (130 kD) protein that catalyzes the
conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cy-
clic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Myocardial
cAMP levels are an important element in heart
function. In studies conducted in pigs with HF, IC
AC6 gene transfer increased LV AC6 content, im-
proved heart function, and reversed adverse LV
remodeling.12
The benefits of AC6 appear to be independent of
increased levels of cAMP through favorable actions
on Ca2+ handling.13,14 These novel properties of
AC6 differ from drugs that increase intracellular
cAMP, such as milrinone, which reduce survival in
HF. Indeed, increased cardiac AC6 content pro-
longs life in murine genetic cardiomyopathy.15 Fi-
nally, unlike milrinone, in preclinical studies, AC6
does not cause unbridled cAMP generation and
reduces arrhythmias.16
The trial examined the safety and efficacy of
IC delivery of Ad5.hAC6 in patients with symp-
tomatic HFrEF (EF £40%). This multicenter,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study5
randomized 56 subjects at a 3:1 ratio to receive IC
Ad5.hAC6 at one of five doses, ranging from
3.2 · 109 to 1012 virus particles (vp) or placebo,
along with concomitant infusion of IC nitroprus-
side (Table 1). The primary endpoints were change
from baseline in treadmill exercise time in rest or
dobutamine-stimulated EF by echocardiography
and in LV pressure development (+dP/dt) or de-
cline (–dP/dt) before and during dobutamine infu-
sion during cardiac catheterization. Follow-up
measurement of dP/dt was at 4 weeks; exercise
testing and EF were reassessed 4 and 12 weeks
after randomization. Pre-specified analyses in-
cluded a key efficacy comparison on an intention-
to-treat basis of the 14 placebo participants, with
the 24 Ad5.hAC6 participants receiving the high-
est two doses (D4 + D5).
Data were reported for 56 subjects who were
randomized and monitored for up to 1 year. The 42
(75%) subjects who received Ad5.hAC6 were well
matched with the 14 (25%) who received placebo.
Approximately half of each group had an ischemic
etiology of HF.
Safety in AC6 gene transfer trial.
No significant
adverse events occurred during study product ad-
ministration. Transient troponin I elevations (with
normal CKMB and no chest pain or ECG changes)
occurred the following day, leading to 1 day hos-
pitalization in three participants, one of whom re-
ceived placebo. Troponin I was increased compared
with baseline levels on days 2 and 4 in both the
placebo and D4 + D5 participants, with no group
differences and no increases in creatine kinase MB.
There was no evidence for hepatotoxicity in pa-
tients receiving Ad5.hAC6.
At 12 months, the percentage of participants
with one or more serious adverse events was
similar between groups. The HF admission rate
was 9.5% (four episodes among 42 subjects) among
the AC6 participants and 28.6% (four episodes
among 14 subjects) among placebo participants
( p < 0.10). There were two deaths, one in each
group: (AC6, 2%; placebo, 7%; p = 0.40). There were
two transplantations, both in AC6 participants
( p = 0.9 vs. placebo). The overall rates of ICD events
and episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachy-
cardia showed no group differences (Table 2).
Efficacy in AC6 gene transfer trial.
Twenty-one
subjects who received the highest two doses of
Ad5.hAC6 (D4 + D5) had a significant increase in
EF at 4 weeks (29.7–36.3%, mean increase of 6.0
EF units; p < 0.004) but not at 12 weeks (29.7–
34.2%, mean increase of 3.0 EF units; p = 0.16). The
increase in EF at 4 weeks in AC6 participants was
dose related ( p < 0.04). The 14 subjects who re-
ceived placebo had an increase from baseline EF
that was not statistically significant at 4 weeks
(29.6–33.7%, mean increase of 4.1 EF units;
p = 0.08) or at 12 weeks (29.6–31.6%, mean increase
of 0.8 EF units; p = 0.31).
Treadmill performance did not increase in the 17
D4 + D5 participants who were able to exercise at 4
weeks or in the 13 placebo participants (from 416 to
446s;p=0.46).Treadmilltimeincreasedto501sat12
weeks in both groups, which was a significant change
from baseline in the 12 placebo subjects ( p=0.03) but
not in the 17 D4 + D5 subjects ( p=0.06).
Basal (unstimulated) LV peak –dP/dt at 4 weeks
improved in 21 D4 + D5 subjects (-39 mmHg/s)
but worsened after randomization in placebo sub-
jects (+93 mmHg/s change), and this between-
group difference was significant ( p < 0.03). There
was no group difference in dobutamine-stimulated
LV peak +dP/dt or LV peak –dP/dt.
Neither group had a change in HF symptom score
at 4 weeks. At 12 weeks, there was a reduction in
symptom score in D4 + D5 participants (from 28.8 to
20.5; p=0.0005) but not in placebo participants (from
30.8 to 23; p=0.16). Anti-Ad5 titers ranged from
<1:18 (undetectable) to >1:4,608. There was no asso-
382
PENNY AND HAMMOND
 ciation between pre-randomization anti-Ad5 titer
and any efficacy endpoint (Table 2).
The investigators concluded that this one-time
administration of Ad5.hAC6 safely increased LV
function beyond standard HF therapy and that
larger trials were warranted.
Safety of clinical gene transfer in HFrEF
In each of these trials, gene transfer was
performed with an acceptable safety profile (Table
2). The delivery technique was not associated
with an increased rate of adverse events. Subjects
had an uneventful subsequent early course, with
only low levels of troponin-I elevation without
clinical sequalae noted in both the placebo and
Ad5.hAC6 subjects in the AC6 trial. There was no
evidence of adverse consequences of gene transfer
at 1 year follow-up in CUPID-2, STOP-HF, and
Ad5.hAC6.
The genes delivered in these trials were antic-
ipated to improve the function of the failing heart
in different ways. To promote the extent of IC
vector delivery and thereby reduce vector dose,
simultaneous intravenous nitroglycerine17 or IC
nitroprusside18 were used. Arrhythmias were a
theoretical concern, and in these trials most of the
subjects had an ICD in place. However, there was
no increase in arrhythmias seen in the subjects
who received gene transfer in these trials, in
particular there was no increase in arrhythmic
clinical events compared with subjects who re-
ceived placebo (Table 2).
The safety profile of clinical gene transfer in this
high-risk patient population is a major finding.
Recognizing the early and mixed results in terms of
efficacy in these studies, safety supports further
investigations using gene transfer.
CONCLUSIONS
The
favorable
safety
profile
seen
now
in
four randomized clinical trials of gene transfer
in patients with HFrEF has paved the way for
further progress in this field. Although the
experience with these agents is limited, clini-
cally evident adverse immunologic responses,
arrhythmias, and other adverse events have not
been as high as anticipated. The clinical course
of subjects receiving gene transfer has been as
good as or better than that of subjects receiving
placebo. Remaining challenges include refine-
ment of endpoints, optimal dosing, selection of
transgene, and the persistence of benefits.
The
promising
potential
efficacy
of
AAV1
.SERCA2a seen in the initial CUPID was not borne
out by the larger CUPID 2 study. The STOP-HF
study showed potential benefits in patients with
the lowest EF, and additional trials may be plan-
ned. The current work with Ad5.hAC6 has shown
potential benefit at higher doses. A larger study
will be required to confirm the preliminary indi-
cations of improvement in EF and the reduction
of clinical adverse events.
