The key factors underlying the development of allergic diseases—the propensity for a minority of individuals to 
develop dysfunctional responses to harmless environmental molecules—remain undefined. We report a pathway 
of immune counter-regulation that suppresses the development of aeroallergy and shrimp-induced anaphylaxis. In 
mice, signaling through epithelially expressed dectin-1 suppresses the development of type 2 immune responses 
through inhibition of interleukin-33 (IL-33) secretion and the subsequent recruitment of IL-13–producing innate 
lymphoid cells. Although this homeostatic pathway is functional in respiratory epithelial cells from healthy humans, 
it is dramatically impaired in epithelial cells from asthmatic and chronic rhinosinusitis patients, resulting in elevated 
IL-33 production. Moreover, we identify an association between a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 
dectin-1 gene loci and reduced pulmonary function in two cohorts of asthmatics. This intronic SNP is a predicted 
eQTL (expression quantitative trait locus) that is associated with reduced dectin-1 expression in human tissue. We 
identify invertebrate tropomyosin, a ubiquitous arthropod-derived molecule, as an immunobiologically relevant 
dectin-1 ligand that normally serves to restrain IL-33 release and dampen type 2 immunity in healthy individuals. 
However, invertebrate tropomyosin presented in the context of impaired dectin-1 function, as observed in allergic 
individuals, leads to unrestrained IL-33 secretion and skewing of immune responses toward type 2 immunity. Collec-
tively, we uncover a previously unrecognized mechanism of protection against allergy to a conserved recognition 
element omnipresent in our environment.
INTRODUCTION
Allergy is thought to result from maladaptive immune responses to 
ubiquitous, otherwise harmless environmental proteins, referred to as 
allergens. The immunological mechanisms underlying the propensity 
of specific proteins to behave as allergens in allergic individuals, but not 
in healthy individuals, are not well understood. Although much work 
has centered on the study of the allergen epitopes recognized by T and 
B cells, there is no compelling evidence for common structural charac-
teristics among the diverse T and B cell epitopes recognized in allergic 
individuals (1–3). Thus, it appears doubtful that the presence of 
such B cell and T cell epitopes is sufficient to endow a protein with aller-
genic potential. Recent data suggest that the ability of such proteins to 
drive allergic responses in susceptible hosts may be associated with al-
tered innate immune recognition and/or activation at mucosal surfaces.
Allergen recognition through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) 
is thought to be the critical step that determines either mucosal ho-
meostasis or the development of an inflammatory response to allergen 
exposure. PRRs recognize allergens through pathogen-associated mo-
lecular patterns (PAMPs), and the culmination of the signals [e.g., 
interleukin-33 (IL-33) and IL-25] emanating from such interactions, 
in a cell type–specific manner, dictates the development and magni-
tude of type 2 responses.
C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), a class of carbohydrate structure 
sensing PRRs, have recently been implicated in modulating T helper 2 
(TH2) responses (4, 5). Although the CLR dectin-1 is critical for recog-
nition of fungal -glucans and mounting of TH17-mediated immune 
responses (6, 7), it has recently been shown to signal the presence of 
nonfungal ligands including the mammalian protein vimentin (8–10), 
suggesting that dectin-1 is a multipotent receptor whose function ex-
tends beyond fungal sensing. This highlights the complexity and di-
versity of PRR-ligand interactions. An expanded ligand repertoire for 
dectin-1 suggests the possibility of a role in the sensing of noninfec-
tious allergens.
RESULTS
Dectin-1 protects against dust mite–induced allergic  
airway disease
To determine the biological relevance of dectin-1, which is encoded 
by the Clec7a gene, in allergic airway inflammation, we sensitized 
Clec7a+/+ and Clec7a−/− littermate C57BL/6 mice with phosphate- 
buffered saline (PBS) or house dust mite (HDM) extract intraperito-
neally followed by either PBS or HDM intratracheal challenges (Fig. 1A) 
and examined hallmarks of the allergic phenotype. Airway responses 
to cholinergic stimulation in PBS-exposed mice were similar in both

genotypes. However, after HDM challenges, Clec7a−/− mice had sig-
nificantly higher airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) compared with 
Clec7a+/+ mice (Fig. 1B), suggesting an inherent protective role for 
airway-expressed dectin-1. Exacerbated AHR in Clec7a−/− mice was 
also accompanied by greater bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) eosino-
philia (Fig. 1C). Conversely, Clec7a deficiency was associated with 
diminished HDM-induced neutrophilia (Fig. 1D), supporting its pre-
viously reported role in neutrophil recruitment. Consistent with their 
exaggerated allergic phenotype, Clec7a-deficient mice had substantial 
mucus plugging of the airway lumen, and more mucus-positive epi-
thelial cells, compared with Clec7a+/+ mice (Fig. 1, E and F). However, 
we find that loss of dectin-1 did not alter total HDM-induced IgE 
(Fig. 1G).
Our data are in contrast to a report showing a proallergic role for 
dectin-1 in response to HDM (11). However, the study used vendor- 
bought, unrelated C57BL/6 as controls for comparison with Clec7a−/− 
mice, and not littermate controls, which may be a considerable con-
founder as previously reported (12–14). To further confirm the protective 
role of dectin-1 in allergen-mediated airway responses, we exposed 
Clec7a−/−, and Clec7a+/+, mice to HDM solely through the airways 
(Fig. 1H), and consistent with systemic HDM sensitization, these 
Clec7a−/− mice also developed exacerbated HDM-induced AHR 
(Fig. 1I). Further, we also gave BALB/c mice intratracheal administra-
tion (Fig. 1J) of a dectin-1–blocking antibody (30 g) or isotype con-
trol antibody (30 g) in combination with HDM (50 g). Consistent 
with genetic dectin-1 deficiency, dectin-1 blockade resulted in exacer-
bated AHR (Fig. 1K), higher total BAL cells (Fig. 1L), and elevated 
BAL eosinophil numbers (Fig. 1M) as compared with mice receiving 
isotype control antibodies. Overall, we demonstrate that neutralizing 
dectin-1, via either genetic or antibody-mediated approaches, exacer-
bates dust mite–mediated allergic asthma. This demonstrates the gen-
eralizable phenomena that dectin-1 is a protective pathway against 
asthma pathogenesis.
Dectin-1 regulates IL-13+ innate lymphoid cells
Consistent with its previously recognized role in driving TH17 re-
sponses, loss of dectin-1 resulted in decreased HDM-induced Il17a 
expression (Fig. 2A). However, because type 2 immune responses are 
the central drivers of allergic responses, we investigated their regu-
lation by dectin-1. Allergen-driven type 2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and 
IL-13) drive the hallmark features of allergic diseases, including AHR, 
eosinophilia, and mucus production. Among these, IL-13 has been 
shown to be a central mediator of allergic asthma (15). To determine 
whether the enhanced allergic phenotype of Clec7a-deficient mice re-
sulted from increased type 2 cytokine expression, we examined lung 
type 2 cytokine levels in Clec7a+/+ and Clec7a−/− mice. We found that 
HDM-induced expression of Il4 and IL5 was not significantly regu-
lated by dectin-1 (Fig. 2, B and C). However, we found that Clec7a- 
deficient mice expressed greater amounts of Il13 mRNA than controls 
(Fig. 2D). Despite greater Il13 expression, we observed equivalent 
numbers of IL-13+ T cells in both Clec7a+/+ and Clec7a−/− mice (Fig. 2E). 
Also, both genotypes had similar numbers of HDM-induced regulato-
ry T cells (Tregs; Fig. 2F). These results suggest that the loss of dectin-1 
does not modulate the development of CD4+ TH2 cells and that there 
is likely a non-CD4+ T cell source of IL-13 that is regulated by dectin-1.
Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), which are a potent innate 
source of IL-13, participate in the maintenance of allergic diseases (16). 
Clec7a-deficient mice treated with a single inhalational exposure to 
HDM (100 g) had significantly elevated numbers of IL-13+ ILC2 cells 
(lineage−CD45+ST2+IL-13+) in their lungs compared with littermate 
controls (Fig. 2G and fig. S1, A and B, for gating). To verify that dectin-1 
regulates a non–T cell arm of type 2 immunity, we crossed Clec7a−/− 
mice onto the Rag1−/− background (devoid of B and T cells). Whereas 
Rag1−/− mice failed to mount allergen-induced AHR, Clec7a−/−Rag1−/− 
mice showed a significant increase in HDM-driven AHR (Fig. 2H) 
and higher levels of lung IL-13+ ILCs (Fig. 2I). These findings indicate 
that the increased asthmatic phenotype in Clec7a−/− mice is associated 
with aberrant IL-13 production from ILCs.
Dectin-1 regulates dust mite–induced epithelial  
IL-33 production
Given the central role of innate cytokines such as IL-25, IL-33, and 
TSLP (thymic stromal lymphopoietin) in regulating group 2 ILCs 
(17, 18), we investigated whether dectin-1 regulated their production. 
Genetic deletion of dectin-1 led to significantly increased levels of 
IL-33 in BAL after HDM exposure (Fig. 3A). This dysregulation was 
specific. HDM exposure failed to augment baseline BAL concentra-
tions of IL-25 in Clec7a+/+ or Clec7a−/− mice (Fig. 3B), and TSLP was 
not detected in the BAL. To evaluate whether IL-33 drives the aberrant 
allergic phenotype of Clec7a−/− mice, we used antibody-mediated neu-
tralization of IL-33 receptor (ST2) signaling (see protocol in Materials 
and Methods and fig. S1). Antibody-mediated blockade of ST2 re-
duced the aberrant AHR (Fig. 3C) and mucus production (fig. S2) seen 
in Clec7a-deficient mice while having no effect on Clec7a-sufficient 
mice, consistent with our data showing that littermate controls on the 
C57BL/6 background secrete little to no IL-33 in response to HDM. 
These data demonstrate that dectin-1 protects against asthma patho-
genesis by regulating IL-33 production.
Although dectin-1 expression has been primarily associated with 
antigen-presenting cells (APCs), recent studies have demonstrated 
that dectin-1 is also expressed by mucosal epithelial cells (19, 20). 
Moreover, because epithelial cells are a primary source of IL-33 in the 
lungs (21–25), we ascertained the contribution of Clec7a expression in 
hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic compartments to allergic air-
way disease. To this end, we generated Clec7a bone marrow (BM) 
chimeric mice. We observed about 97% chimerism 5 months after 
reconstitution (fig. S3, A and B), suggesting that host or donor Clec7a 
deficiency did not alter hematopoietic stem cell engraftment potential. 
Chimeric mice were then challenged with PBS or HDM (as shown in 
Fig. 1A). Next, we found, consistent with our previous data, that mice 
lacking Clec7a in both the hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic 
compartments (Clec7a−/− BM into Clec7a−/− host) had higher HDM- 
induced AHR (Fig. 3D), eosinophilia (fig. S3C), and mucus produc-
tion (fig. S3, D and E) as compared with control mice, sufficient for 
Clec7a in both compartments (Clec7a+/+ BM into Clec7a+/+ host). 
However, we found, similar to whole-body Clec7a KO mice, that ani-
mals that lost dectin-1 on nonhematopoietic cells only (Clec7a+/+ BM 
into Clec7a−/− host) retained exacerbated allergen-induced AHR 
(Fig. 3D), BAL eosinophilia (fig. S3C), and mucus production (fig. S3, 
D and E). Conversely, mice that lost dectin-1 on hematopoietic 
cells, but retained it on nonhematopoietic cells (Clec7a−/− BM into 
Clec7a+/+ host), had a similar phenotype as control mice (Clec7a+/+ BM 
into Clec7a+/+ host; Fig. 3D and fig. S3, C to E).
These data suggest that sensing of dust mite by dectin-1 expressed 
on lung structural cells is both necessary and sufficient to protect 
against exacerbated experimental asthma. Consistent with its reported 
proinflammatory role on APCs (26, 27), mice deficient for dectin-1 
in the hematopoietic compartment displayed lower HDM-induced

mucus-positive epithelial cells (fig. S3, D and E). Our data demon-
strate that dectin-1–mediated sensing of dust mite through structural 
cells of the lungs is protective and dominant because it recapitulates 
the total body Clec7a−/− phenotype.
Dectin-1 is robustly expressed by epithelial cells (CD45−EpCAM+) in 
human nasal tissues (fig. S4), consistent with previous studies demon-
strating dectin-1 expression by human gut and airway epithelial cells 
(19, 20). Although nonepithelial structural cells (CD45−EpCAM−) in 
human nasal tissue also express dectin-1, such expression appears 
to be relatively minimal compared with epithelial cells (fig. S4). We 
next demonstrate that dectin-1 regulates IL-33 in human epithelia: 
(i) Antibody-mediated blockade of dectin-1 signaling led to enhance-
ment of HDM-induced IL-33 release in a human bronchial epithelial 
cell line (Fig. 3E), and (ii) epithelial cell overexpression of dectin-1 se-
creted significantly less HDM-induced IL-33 than control cells (Fig. 3F), 
whereas the secretion of other cytokines, such as IL-6 (Fig. 3G), was 
not modulated. These data demonstrate that allergen recognition by 
epithelial expression of dectin-1 plays a critical role in regulating IL-33 
specifically.
-Glucans do not modulate allergen-induced AHR or 
epithelial IL-33 production
We show that, in a model of allergy involving a noninfectious source 
of allergens such as HDM, dectin-1 is protective. However, in mouse 
models of live fungal allergy, dectin-1 mediates proinflammatory 
responses to fungal -glucans, which exacerbate asthma (6). These 
-glucans, specifically, -1,3/-1,6-glucans, are the prototypical carbo-
hydrate PAMP ligands for dectin-1. Dust mites are known to harbor 
fungi in their gastrointestinal tract (28), and -glucans in dust mite 
extract have been shown to be necessary for HDM induction of CCL20 
in the airway epithelium (29). However, -glucan depletion of dust 
mite extracts via enzymatic (-glucanase) digestion, when compared 
with vehicle control, had no effect on human epithelial IL-33 secretion 
(Fig. 4A). Supporting this observation, mice receiving either control- 
treated HDM or -glucanase–digested HDM had equivalent airway 
responses (Fig. 4B). Conversely, exogenous administration of curdlan, 
a polysaccharide consisting of -1-3–linked glucose (-1-3-glucan), 
concomitant with HDM or ovalbumin (OVA) did not significantly 
alter allergen-induced AHR (Fig. 4, C and D). Together, these data 
suggest that -glucan does not regulate IL-33 or airway responses and 
that dectin-1–mediated protection against HDM-driven asthma is 
independent of -glucan signaling. This suggests that dectin-1 recog-
nizes an alternative ligand in dust mite extract, the binding of which 
confers protection against type 2 immune responses.
Invertebrate tropomyosin is a ligand for dectin-1
To identify this ligand, we incubated a recombinant extracellular do-
main human fusion dectin-1–Fc with PBS or HDM, followed by affin-
ity purification and electrophoretic analysis. Our data reveal that 
dectin-1–Fc (57 kDa) binds a single 37-kDa ligand in HDM (Fig. 5A). 
This interaction was specific because the control Fc (53 kDa) did not 
bind any HDM protein ligand (fig. S5). We identified this ligand as 
mite invertebrate tropomyosin (Der p 10) by mass spectrometry (MS) 
analysis (Fig. 5B). Invertebrate tropomyosins from different aller-
genic sources are highly cross-reactive because they share in excess of 
80% homology (30). Therefore, it is likely that antibodies generated 
against dust mite invertebrate tropomyosin (Der p 10) would cross- 
react with tropomyosin from other invertebrates such as its shrimp 
homolog Pen 1 a. Therefore, we examined the ability of dectin-1 to 
recognize invertebrate tropomyosins from other allergenic sources. 
We incubated allergen extracts (HDM, shrimp, alder, and peanut) 
with dectin-1–Fc, followed by immunoprecipitation and immuno-
blotting with anti–invertebrate tropomyosin (anti–Der p 10) or iso-
type control monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We demonstrate that 
dectin-1 specifically binds to invertebrate tropomyosin in both mite 
and shrimp extracts, but not in tropomyosin-devoid plant allergen 
extracts (Fig. 5C).
To confirm whether invertebrate tropomyosin–dectin-1 interac-
tions can inhibit HDM-induced allergic inflammation, we treated 
wild-type mice with HDM alone or HDM supplemented with recom-
binant Der p 10 (dust mite tropomyosin). Hallmark features of type 2 
inflammation including AHR (Fig. 5D), BAL eosinophilia (Fig. 5E), 
and mucus cell hyperplasia (Fig. 5F) were significantly abrogated by 
addition of rDer p 10 to dust mite extract. Consistent with published 
reports showing that dectin-1 ligation can drive neutrophilia, Der p 10 
enhanced neutrophil influx (Fig. 5G). Next, we demonstrate that the 
protective effect of Der p 10–dectin-1 ligation is generalizable to other 
proallergic triggers. For this, we made use of a chitin-driven allergic 
airway inflammation model. Chitin, a 1-4 carbohydrate (31) that does 
not bind dectin-1 (32), is a well-established driver of type 2 inflam-
mation, dominated by IL-5 and eosinophils (33, 34). We show that 
Der p 10 inhibits chitin-induced AHR (fig. S6A) and chitin- 
induced

inflammation such as total BAL cell infiltration (fig. S6B) and BAL 
eosinophils (fig. S6C), but invertebrate tropomyosin (Der p 10)– 
dectin-1 
interaction induces airway neutrophils (fig. S6D). These data establish 
a broad role for the sensing of invertebrate tropomyosin as a dampen-
ing signal for pro–type 2 stimuli.
Further, we show that blockade of Der p 10–dectin-1 interac-
tions with anti–Der p 10 mAb treatment enhanced HDM-mediated 
IL-33 production in mice (Fig. 5H) and in cultured epithelial cells 
(Fig. 5I). These data demonstrate that the interaction of Der p 10 with 
dectin-1 inhibits type 2 immune responses by regulating IL-33 re-
lease, suggesting that pro–IL-33 signals such as HDM or chitin (33, 35) 
can be counter-regulated by the sensing of environmental inverte-
brate tropomyosin.
In susceptible individuals, invertebrate tropomyosin is a major 
contributor to shellfish allergies (35). Thus, we investigated the role of 
dectin-1 in a model of shrimp extract–driven systemic anaphylaxis. 
Clec7a+/+ and Clec7a−/− mice that were orally sensitized to shrimp, and 
systemically challenged with shrimp extract, displayed a drop in body 
temperature, consistent with anaphylactic shock (Fig. 5J). However, in 
line with our data with the respiratory mite allergen, Clec7a−/− mice 
developed significantly greater hypothermia than littermate controls 
(Fig. 5J). Moreover, consistent with the fact that IL-33 signaling has

been shown to be central in driving experimental food anaphylaxis 
(36, 37), especially during sensitization through the gut (36), we found 
that dectin-1 blockade drove more IL-33 release from epithelial 
cells in response to shrimp extract (Fig. 5K). Our data indicate that 
the shrimp invertebrate tropomyosin–dectin-1 interaction normally 
serves to dampen IL-33 production and the development of ana-
phylaxis. This provides evidence of a broader context of dectin-1– 
invertebrate tropomyosin interactions in regulating IL-33–mediated 
allergic diseases.
Dectin-1 is repressed in allergic individuals
To explore whether this protective pathway is disrupted in humans 
with allergic disorders, we examined the expression and regulation of 
dectin-1 in epithelial cells from control and allergic individuals, which 
had positive skin prick test for dust mites. We found that CLEC7A 
expression was significantly repressed in primary bronchial epithelial 
cells isolated from asthmatics as compared with controls (Fig. 6A). 
Extending our observations to patients with chronic rhinosinusitis 
(CRS), who are commonly HDM-sensitized (38) and display a dysreg-
ulated IL-33–ILC2 axis (39, 40), we also found repressed CLEC7A 
levels in the sino-nasal epithelial cells (NECs) from these patients as 
compared with healthy controls (Fig. 6B). The reduced dectin-1 ex-
pression in allergic patients is associated with a significantly greater 
secretion of IL-33 as compared with epithelial cells from healthy indi-
viduals after HDM exposure (Fig. 6C). These studies support a link 
between deficient epithelial cell dectin-1 signaling, IL-33, and allergic 
disease in humans.
A CLEC7A polymorphism is associated with decreased lung 
function in asthma
Next, we wanted to determine whether there is a genetic susceptibility 
associated with a CLEC7A polymorphism and asthma. To this end, we 
evaluated 143 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CLEC7A in 
GALA II (Genes-environments and Admixture in Latino Americans) 
(n = 2861; Latino American cohort) and SAGE (Study of African 
Americans, Asthma, Genes and Environments) (n = 1414; African 
American cohort), two separate studies of childhood asthma (Fig. 7, 
A and B). To increase the power of our analyses and capture effects 
shared between the two populations, we performed a meta-analysis 
across the two studies (Fig. 7C). We identified a single significant 
association: The G allele of rs58677678 (Fig. 7D) was associated with 
reduced lung function [forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)], a car-
dinal feature of asthma pathogenesis (P = 2.23 × 10−4; Fig. 7E and 
table S1). In the context of the 143 SNPs that were evaluated in this 
study, there is strong evidence that this association is not due to ran-
dom chance (Bonferroni threshold: 0.05/143 = 3.5 × 10−4). Moreover, 
we have determined the frequency of the CLEC7A polymorphism 
in the 1000 Genomes population, and confirm its presence in other 
populations (fig. S7). This intronic SNP is a predicted expression quan-
titative trait locus (eQTL) for CLEC7A (41, 42) in multiple tissues; spe-
cifically, in the lung, genotype at rs58677678 is significantly correlated 
with CLEC7A gene expression (Fig. 7F and table S2). In all assayed 
tissues, individuals with increased copies of the rs58677678 G allele 
have decreased expression of CLEC7A (Fig. 7F and table S2). Together, 
these findings suggest that genetic variants in CLEC7A may contribute 
to asthma severity and lung function.
DISCUSSION
In susceptible individuals, exposure to common allergens drives ab-
errant type 2 responses and the development of allergic diseases. 
Conversely, these exposures do not lead to pathology in healthy indi-
viduals, suggesting that protective pathways are critical in maintain-
ing tissue homeostasis. Innate sensing of allergens through PRRs is 
thought to be a critical step that determines either mucosal homeo-
stasis or an inflammatory response to allergens. It has been recently 
demonstrated that some environmental exposures, such as endotoxin, 
can protect against the development of allergy (43, 44), suggesting that 
we have evolved protective pathways to sense our environment. De-
spite this, little is known about the role of innate sensors in preventing 
overzealous immune activation in the context of allergic diseases. 
Here, we report that dectin-1 controls type 2 immunity in the lungs in 
response to the dust mite aeroallergen. Specifically, we demonstrate 
that the mechanism responsible for the dectin-1–mediated protection 
of asthma is through the regulation of IL-33–driven IL-13 production 
from ILCs. Our data are consistent with previous findings showing 
that airway exposure of Clec7a−/− mice to 
Aspergillus versicolor spores leads to ex-
acerbated IL-13 production (45).
PRRs, including dectin-1, are classi-
cally associated with APCs; however, we 
and others show that mucosal epithelial 
cells express these sensors (20, 46, 47). 
Moreover, it appears that cell type– 
specific 
expression of PRRs can lead to differen-
tial immune activation. This has recently 
been shown in the context of epithelial 
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) that drives 
TH2 responses, whereas TLR4 on APC 
drives TH17 immunity (48, 49). Our data 
using chimeric mice establish that dectin-1 
expressed by lung structural cells is re-
sponsible for the protective phenotype. 
Whereas APC-expressed dectin-1 is con-
ventionally associated with a proinflam-
matory function, we show that engagement 
of epithelial dectin-1 is protective. Our

data support the concept that PRR-mediated environmental sensing 
by barrier epithelial cells is critical in regulating type 2 immunity (50). 
Control of dust mite–induced epithelial IL-33 is central to the protec-
tive role of dectin-1. However, although 
little is known about the regulation of 
IL-33 release from epithelial cells, re-
cent data suggest that it is released from 
preformed stores in a redox-dependent 
manner (51). Because dectin-1 has been 
previously reported to modulate path-
ways associated with cellular redox (52), 
this raises the interesting possibility that 
dectin-1 may prevent overzealous se-
cretion of IL-33 by controlling cellular 
redox.
-1-3/1-6-Glucans are the prototypi-
cal ligands for dectin-1, but their role in 
allergic disease is controversial in mice 
and humans. Some groups have shown 
that -1-3-glucans have a protective role 
(53, 54), and others show that environ-
mental exposure to -1-3-glucans is as-
sociated with greater asthma burden in 
children (55) and can exacerbate aller-
gic asthma in mice (56). Mice exposed 
to a mixture of -1-3-glucan and HDM 
extract develop exacerbated eosinophil-
ia, which was independent of dectin-1 
(56). In addition to dectin-1, -glucans 
can bind several other receptors (TLR2, 
CR3, scavenger receptors, and lactosyl 
ceramide) (57–60). In the context of HDM 
exposure, it is possible that -glucans in 
the dust mite extract may have greater 
affinity for these other receptors or that 
different -glucan moieties drive differ-
ent cellular processes. Nevertheless, our 
data demonstrate that -1-3-glucans have 
no significant effects on epithelial IL-33 
secretion or the development of allergen- 
induced AHR. On the basis of this, we 
set out to find an alternative ligand for 
dectin-1. We identified invertebrate tro-
pomyosin as a ligand for dectin-1. Al-
though innocuous in most individuals, 
invertebrate tropomyosin has been iden-
tified as a major arthropod allergen in 
susceptible individuals (61). Invertebrate 
tropomyosins are present in several sub-
phyla and classes of arthropods (includ-
ing crustaceans, arachnids, and mites/
insects) as well as in helminths (62). In-
vertebrate tropomyosins from various 
sources are highly homologous, explaining 
why antibodies against dust mite tropo-
myosin (Der p 10/Der f 10) can cross- 
react 
with shrimp tropomyosin (Pen 1 a). Al-
though fungi contain tropomyosins (63), 
they are intracellular and not normally 
accessible to the host’s immune cells. However, - 
glucan moieties, which 
become exposed during fungal cell replication (64), engage dectin-1 
to drive TH17 antifungal responses. On the other hand, exposure to

arthropods (mites, cockroaches, and crustacea) usually arises from 
nonreplicating, noninfectious, cellular fragments/debris/feces, inhaled 
or ingested, and thus containing exposed tropomyosin molecules that, 
sensed through dectin-1, can dampen overzealous activation of type 
2 responses. Moreover, similar to our data showing a dampening of 
type 2 immune responses by invertebrate tropomyosin, other in-
vertebrate products such as helminth- 
derived proteins can prevent 
aberrant type 2 inflammation. Recently, Heligmosomoides polygyrus 
excretory/secreted products have been shown to suppress IL-33 pro-
duction from epithelial cells (65, 66). Although preventing anti-parasitic 
type 2 responses is advantageous to worms, it suggests the broader 
concept that some environmental proteins can drive homeostatic 
responses.
Our studies in mice translate into humans in that we demonstrate 
that this homeostatic pathway is impaired in allergic airway epithelial 
cells from asthmatics and patients with CRS. This impairment in the 
dectin-1–mediated protective response is associated with a genetic 
variant in a gene for dectin-1, CLEC7A (rs58677678A/G), associated 
with lower lung function (FEV1), the clinical hallmark of asthma, 
across two independent cohorts of children (GALA II and SAGE). 
This intronic SNP predicts an eQTL resulting in reduced CLEC7A 
expression in the lungs and other human tissues.
Although our report highlights an important regulatory role for 
dectin-1 in mice and humans, our mouse studies did not show a role 
of dectin-1 in the regulation of immunoglobulin E (IgE). A limitation 
of using mice to model human allergic diseases is that, in mice, only 
IL-4 is essential for B cell–mediated IgE production, whereas in hu-
mans both IL-4 and IL-13 can drive IgE. Therefore, it is plausible that 
dectin-1 may regulate IgE in humans through its control of IL-13. 
Moreover, although we provide initial insight into a genetic role for 
CLEC7A and asthma, it would be of importance to further explore our 
genetic findings in other populations of allergic individuals and to 
conduct a larger study of CLEC7A/dectin-1 expression and the G allele 
of rs58677678 in asthmatic individuals.
We are repeatedly exposed not only to environmentally ubiquitous 
sources of allergens that contain pro–IL-33 moieties such as endo-
toxin and chitin (33–35, 67–70) but also to other abundant proteins 
such as invertebrate tropomyosin. We have found that mammals have 
evolved a protective response to continuous exposure to invertebrate 
tropomyosin. In normal individuals, invertebrate tropomyosin bind-
ing of dectin-1 at the airway surface results in prevention/suppression 
of IL-33–driven inflammation and sensitization to invertebrate tro-
pomyosin. In contrast, in allergic/asthmatic individuals, decrements 
in epithelial dectin-1 expression, likely as a result of a mutation in 
CLEC7A, result in aberrant secretion of IL-33 at mucosal surfaces. 
IL-33, in turn, drives IL-13 production from ILC2s and conditions 
dendritic cells (DCs) to promote type 2 immune responses. Thus, ex-
posure to inhaled or ingested invertebrate tropomyosin in the pres-
ence of IL-33 from local epithelial cells may promote DC activation 
and antigen presentation to T cells, leading to TH2 cell skewing (Fig. 8). 
Our results provide critical new insights into the mechanisms under-
lying susceptibility to a wide range of allergic disorders, including 
asthma, rhinosinusitis, and food allergy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The objective of this study was to investigate the role of dectin-1 in 
HDM-induced experimental asthma. Generally, in vivo experiments 
consisted of enumerating inflammatory cells by differential counting, 
or flow cytometry, evaluation of mucus production and determination 
of AHR in response to HDM. All mouse experiments used littermate 
controls for comparison. In vitro experiments were used to examine 
the effect of dectin-1 and dectin-1 ligand on epithelial cell IL-33 release. 
The number of independent experiments is outlined in the figure leg-
ends, where appropriate. Experiments were not randomized, and the in-
vestigators were not blinded during experiments and endpoint analyses.
Allergen sensitization and challenge
Seven- to 10-week-old Clec7a+/+ and Clec7a−/− mice were sensitized 
to HDM by intraperitoneal injection with PBS (100 l) or HDM 
(10 g/100 l in PBS; Greer Laboratories) on days 0 and 7. Mice were 
then challenged intratracheally with PBS (40 l) or HDM (100 g/40 l) 
on days 14 and 21. Seventy-two hours after the last challenge, the aller-
gic phenotype was assessed. Alternatively, Clec7a+/+ and Clec7a−/− 
mice were exposed to HDM only via the airways; for this, animals were 
sensitized to 10 g of HDM intratracheally on day 0 and then 100 g 
of HDM intratracheally on days 7 and 14, followed by five intranasal 
HDM challenges (75 g on days 16 to 20). Forty-eight hours after the 
last challenge, airway responses were determined. For experiments 
involving ST2 blockade, a day before each sensitization (i.e., days −1 
and 6) and challenge (i.e., days 13 and 20), mice were given 250 g of 
either isotype control antibody (rat IgG2a; Bio X Cell) or anti-mouse 
ST2 antibody (Amgen) intraperitoneally. For experiments involving 
Clec7a−/−Rag1−/−, mice were sensitized intraperitoneally with PBS or 
HDM (10 g; days 0 and 7) followed by intranasal administration of 
PBS or HDM (62.5 g/25 l) every other day for 8 days. Forty-eight 
hours after the last challenge, the allergic phenotype was assessed. 
For rDer p 10 administration, 7- to 9-week-old male BALB/c mice 
were given PBS, 50 g of HDM, or 10 g of rDer p 10 plus HDM 
intratracheally in a total volume of 40 to 50 l on days 0 and 5 and

ing of dectin-1 at mucosal surfaces results in suppression of IL-33–driven inflamma-
tion. In contrast, in allergic individuals, decreased levels of epithelial dectin-1 result 
in aberrant secretion of IL-33, which in turn drives IL-13 production from ILC2 and 
conditions local DCs to promote type 2 immune responses.

measured on day 7. For anti–mDectin-1, male BALB/c mice were given 
50 g of HDM combined with either 30 g of isotype control (rat 
IgG2a) or a neutralizing dectin-1 mAb intratracheally in a total vol-
ume of 50 l on days 0 and 14. On day 16, the allergic phenotype was 
assessed. For curdlan (a source of 1-3-glucans) in vivo experiments, 
C57BL/6 mice were sensitized intraperitoneally with either PBS, OVA 
(20 g), or HDM (10 g) intraperitoneally on days 0 and 7, followed 
by challenges with either PBS, OVA (750 g), OVA plus curdlan 
(100 g), HDM (100 g), or HDM plus curdlan (100 g) intratracheally 
on days 14 and 21. AHR was determined on day 24.
Lung mucus stain
Lungs were excised and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, pro-
cessed, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned. Sections were stained with 
periodic acid–Schiff (PAS). To quantify mucus-producing airway epi-
thelial cells, the percentage of PAS+ cells were determined using a light 
microscope.
Experiments using -glucanase–treated HDM
-Glucanase treatment of HDM was performed as previously pub-
lished. Briefly, HDM extracts were incubated with vehicle or -glucanase 
for 1 hour at 56°C (29). A/J mice were challenged with PBS, HDM, 
HDM plus vehicle, or -glucanase–treated HDM on days 0 (100 g, 
intratracheally) and 14 (100 g, intratracheally), followed by AHR 
measurement on day 17.
Airway measurements
Briefly, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of 
ketamine/xylazine and tracheotomized before insertion of an 18-gauge 
cannula into the trachea. Mice were paralyzed with suxamethonium 
chloride (3 mg/kg), intubated, and respirated at a rate of 120 breaths 
per minute with a constant tidal volume (0.2 ml). After a stable base-
line was achieved, mice were exposed to nebulized methacholine (10 to 
30 mg/ml; Sigma). After 10 s, dynamic airway pressure (cm H2O × s) 
was recorded for 5 min. After airway reactivity measurements, serum, 
BAL fluid, and lungs were collected and processed as previously de-
scribed (71).
Food anaphylaxis
Female Clec7a−/− and Clec7a+/+ littermate controls were sensitized by 
oral gavage of 0.5 mg of shrimp extract containing 10 g of cholera 
toxin in 200 l on days 0, 7, and 14. Mice were then challenged system-
ically with 0.5 mg of shrimp extract intraperitoneally. Body tempera-
ture was monitored every 15 min for 1 hour, using a dual laser infrared 
thermometer as previously described (72).
Cytokine and IgE ELISAs
IL-25, IL-6, and IL-13 levels were measured using ELISA DuoSets 
(R&D Systems). IL-33 was measured using antibody pairs (R&D 
Systems): capture antibody (AF3625) and biotinylated detection 
antibody (BAF3625). Serum total IgE levels were determined by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; BD OptEIA, BD 
Biosciences).
Real-time PCR
RNA was extracted from snap-frozen lungs or cultured cells using 
TRIzol (Invitrogen). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated 
by reverse transcribing 0.25 to 1 g of RNA using SuperScript III 
(Invitrogen) and random primers (Invitrogen). cDNA was diluted 
sixfold using double-distilled water before polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR). Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Green (Bio-Rad), 
and gene expression was measured using specific primer pairs, which 
span at least one intron to avoid coamplification of genomic DNA. For 
mouse samples, target gene expression was normalized to expression 
of the Rps14 gene. For human samples, target gene expression was 
normalized to RPS13. The following primer sequences were used: 
Il4, 5′-TGAACGAGGTCACAGGAGAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGAGCT-
CACTCTCTGTGGTG-3′ (antisense); Il5, 5′-GCAATGAGACGAT-
GAGGCTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCCACGGACAGTTTGATTCT-3′

Flow cytometry analysis
Mouse lung cells were obtained by digestion of lung tissue with Lib-
erase TL (0.05 mg/ml; Roche) and deoxyribonuclease I (0.5 mg/ml; 
Sigma) for 45 min at 37°C in 5% CO2. Digested tissue was filtered 
through a 70-m nylon mesh (BD Biosciences) and centrifuged. The 
pellet was resuspended in red blood cell lysis buffer (ACK lysis buffer). 
Recovered cells were counted (trypan blue exclusion), plated at 4 × 106 
to 5 × 106 cells/ml, and stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate 
(50 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 g/ml) for 16 hours, and then brefeldin 
A and monensin (eBioscience) were added for the last 3 to 4 hours. All 
cells were filtered using a 40-m nylon mesh (BD Biosciences), washed 
with PBS and labeled with live/dead dye (Zombie Aqua, BioLegend) 
for 10 min at room temperature (RT), and blocked with anti-CD16/32 
(BioLegend) for an additional 20 min at RT. For CD4+IL-13+ stain-
ing, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy 
Sciences) for 10 min at RT and permeabilized in 0.1% saponin (Sigma) 
for 20 min at RT before staining using phycoerythrin (PE)–Cy7– 
conjugated anti-CD4 (RM4-5, eBioscience) and eFluor 660–conjugated 
anti–IL-13 (eBio13A, eBioscience). For IL-13+ ILCs, cells were surface- 
stained using peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP)–Cy5.5–conjugated 
lineage antibodies [CD8 (53-6.7, BioLegend), CD4 (GK1.5, BioLegend), 
CD3 (145-2C11, BD Biosciences), T cell receptor  (TCR) (H57-

eBioscience), Gr1 (RB6-8C5, eBioscience), B220 (RA3-6B2, BD 
Biosciences), and NK1.1 (PK136, BD Biosciences)], Alexa Fluor 700 
anti-CD45 (30-F11, BD Biosciences), and fluorescein isothiocyanate 
(FITC)–anti-ST2 (T1/ST2, MD Bioproducts), then fixed and permea-
bilized (as above), and stained with PE–anti–IL-13 (ebio13A). Data 
were acquired on an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and gated 
to exclude debris and to select single cells (SSC-W/SSC-A). Data were 
analyzed using FACSDiva (BD Biosciences). Positive gates were based 
on fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls.
Cell culture
16HBE cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium 
(DMEM) [10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)], and the immortalized 
human bronchial epithelial cell line 16HBE was grown as previously 
described (29). Cells were seeded at 15,000 cells per well in a 96-well 
flat-bottomed dish in complete DMEM (10% FBS) overnight. Cells

were then serum-starved (0.1% FBS) for 24 hours and then stimulated 
with media or HDM (100 g/ml) or shrimp extract (100 g/ml), and 
supernatants were harvested 2 to 4 hours after for determination of 
cytokine concentration (IL-6 and IL-33). In some experiments, cells were 
pretreated with isotype (5.0 to 7.5 g/ml) or neutralizing antibodies 
to Der p 10 or dectin-1 for 30 min before stimulation. -Glucanase 
treatment of HDM was performed as previously published (29). For 
transfections, 16HBE cells were seeded at 10,000 cells per well of 
a 96-well flat-bottomed dish and transfected using FuGENE HD 
(Promega). Transfected cells were then serum-starved (0.1% FBS) 
overnight and then stimulated with media or HDM (100 g/ml), and 
supernatants were harvested 2 to 4 hours after for determination of 
cytokine concentration.
Human primary nasal tissue epithelial cell culture
Human NECs and sinonasal mucosa were obtained from nasal brush-
ings, and tissue was removed during endoscopic sinus surgery from 
control and patients with nasal polyps as previously described (39). 
The research protocol was approved through the Johns Hopkins In-
stitutional Review process, and all patients gave signed informed 
consent. Inclusion criteria included continuous symptoms of rhinosi-
nusitis for greater than 12 weeks as defined by the American Academy 
of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery Chronic Rhinosinusitis 
Task Force, computed tomography of the sinuses revealing isolated or 
diffuse sinus mucosal thickening or air-fluid levels, and nasal polyps 
visible on diagnostic endoscopy. None of the patients had a history of 
tobacco use, cystic fibrosis, ciliary dyskinesia, systemic inflammato-
ry or autoimmune disease, or immunodeficiency. Isolated sino- 
NECs were grown in Bronchial Epithelial Cell Growth Media (BEGM 
BulletKit, Lonza). At 80% confluency, cells were lifted using trypsin- 
EDTA (0.05%; Gibco) and seeded into a 96-well culture plate pre-
coated with fibronectin-collagen. At 80 to 90% confluency, cells were 
starved overnight [BEGM media without the bovine pituitary extract 
(BEGMnoBP)]. Cells were treated with HDM (200 g/ml) for 2 hours, 
and the supernatants were collected for IL-33 ELISA. The characteris-
tics of the patients are summarized in table S3.
Human bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatics
Fifteen volunteers were recruited from the Asthma Clinic at Institut 
Universitaire de Cardiologie et de Pneumologie (IUCPQ; Québec, 
Canada), and epithelial cells were isolated and cultured as previously 
described (73). RNA isolated (TRIzol) from nonstimulated cells was 
harvested and reverse-transcribed to obtain cDNA, followed by real- 
time PCR. The study was approved by the IUCPQ (Québec, Canada) 
ethics committee, and all patients signed an informed consent form. 
The asthmatic patients were diagnosed according to the American 
Thoracic Society criteria, and the characteristics of the patients are 
summarized in table S4.
BM chimera
Seven- to 8-week-old Clec7a+/+ and Clec7a−/− mice were irradiated 
at a dose of 10 Gy. Fresh BM isolated from nonirradiated Clec7a+/+ 
and Clec7a−/− mice was injected intravenously (2 × 106 cells/100 l) to 
irradiated mice. To avoid infections, irradiated mice were then kept on 
drinking water supplemented with neomycin (1.1 mg/ml) for 2 weeks 
after radiation. Afterward, mice were switched back to neomycin-free 
water. The degree of chimerism was evaluated based on the differ-
ential expression of CD45 isoforms. Because our experimental mice 
(Clec7a+/+ and Clec7a−/−) express the CD45.2 isoform, we used the 
CD45.1-expressing B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ strain. B6.SJL-Ptprca 
Pepcb/BoyJ mice are dectin-1–sufficient and hence were used as wild-
type controls. We transferred either CD45.1 BM (BoyJ) into irradiated 
Clec7a−/− host (CD45.2). Another group of irradiated wild-type (BoyJ, 
CD45.1) mice received Clec7a−/− CD45.2 BM. At the end of 5 months, 
the expression of CD45.1 and CD45.2 isoforms in the lungs was eval-
uated. Chimeric mice were then exposed to HDM as described above.
Dectin-1–Der p 10 coimmunoprecipitation
HDM (250 g), shrimp (250 g), peanut (250 g), and alder (250 g) 
extracts were preincubated with 25 l of prewashed (PBS) protein G 
magnetic beads for 4 hours at 4°C on a rocker to remove nonspecific 
binding. Beads were removed using a magnet, and cleared allergen 
extracts were incubated with dectin-1–Fc (3.5 g) overnight at 4°C on 
a rocker. Twenty-four hours later, 25 l of protein G magnetic beads 
(prewashed) was added and incubated for 4 hours at 4°C on a rocker. 
Beads were magnetically purified and washed three times with PBS 
to remove any nonspecific binding. The pull-down for each extract 
was split in two equal parts and loaded onto an SDS gel (4 to 15% Tris- 
Glycine eXtended, Bio-Rad) and separated by electrophoresis. Pro-
teins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes 
(Bio-Rad) and incubated with anti–Der p 10 (2 g/ml) or isotype con-
trol antibody (2 g/ml; BioLegend, clone MG1-45) overnight at 4°C. 
The blots were developed the following day after incubation with 
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody (anti-mouse 
IgG; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Recombinant Der p 10
Escherichia coli–expressed rDer p 10 was generated as previously de-
scribed (74) and treated with endotoxin removal beads (Miltenyi Biotec).
Human dectin-1 expression vector
The human CLEC7A open reading frame was PCR-amplified from 
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and cloned into pcDNA3.1 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Mass spectrometry
For identification of the protein ligand of dectin-1 in dust mite extract, 
we performed a pull-down using 5 g of control-Fc or dectin-1–Fc 
and 200 g of HDM (as described above). To visualize the ligand, we 
ran the pull-downs on an SDS gel followed by MS-grade silver stain 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). The 37-kDa band was excised for MS anal-
ysis. Der p 10 was identified as the sole ligand with two peptides at a 
1% false discovery rate (FDR).
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed in GraphPad Prism 6. Comparisons between 
more than two groups were done using one-way analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) followed by post hoc test (Figs. 1 to 4) or using two-way 
ANOVA followed by Bonferroni correction for repeated measures 
(Fig. 5J). Comparisons between two groups were done using Student’s 
t test with Welch’s correction (Fig. 6, A and B) or one-way ANOVA 
followed by post hoc test (Fig. 5C). P values of less than 0.05 were 
considered significant.

SAGE study
The SAGE study includes 1989 African American asthma cases 
and controls recruited from clinics in the San Francisco Bay Area 
(1176 cases, 813 controls). The analysis included 1414 individuals 
with baseline FEV1 measurement. Baseline FEV1 measurement is re-
ported as the percentage of the predicted normal value of FEV1 
achieved by the participant (FEV1 percent predicted). The predicted 
normal value of FEV1 for each participant was derived using the 
Hankinson reference equation (75). Asthma was defined as having 
a history of physician-diagnosed asthma and two or more asthma 
symptoms (wheezing, coughing, and/or shortness of breath) in the 
preceding 2 years. Atopy was not an inclusion criterion for the study. 
Controls had no reported history of asthma, allergies, lung disease, 
chronic illness or medication use, coughing, wheezing, or shortness of 
breath in the preceding 2 years; had <10 pack-years of smoking histo-
ry; and had not smoked in the year preceding enrollment. Genotypes 
were called on Affymetrix Axiom LAT 1 (World Array 4) and LAT 
plus HLA genome-wide arrays using Affymetrix Power Tools soft-
ware. Quality control was performed by removing SNPs with call 
rates of <95% and/or deviated from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
(P < 10−6). Samples with call rates of <95%, discrepancy between 
genetic sex and reported sex, or cryptic relatedness (proportion of iden-
tity by descent > 0.3) were removed.
GALA II study
The GALA II study includes 4436 Latino asthma cases and controls 
recruited from community clinics and hospitals from New York, 
Chicago, San Francisco, Houston, and Puerto Rico (2275 cases, 2161 
controls). The analysis included 2861 individuals with baseline FEV1 
measurement. Asthma was defined as having a history of physician- 
diagnosed asthma and two or more asthma symptoms (wheezing, 
coughing, and/or shortness of breath) in the preceding 2 years. Atopy 
was not an inclusion criterion for the study. Controls had no reported 
history of asthma, allergies, lung disease, chronic illness or medica-
tion use, coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath in the preceding 
2 years; had <10 pack-years of smoking history; and had not smoked 
in the year preceding enrollment. Genotyping and quality control 
(QC) process were performed as described in SAGE.
Genetic association testing
Genotype data of all samples were submitted to the Michigan Imputa-
tion Server (https://imputationserver.sph.umich.edu/) for imputa-
tion to the Haplotype Reference Consortium r1 2015 reference panel 
(www.haplotype-reference-consortium.org/) using the Minimac3 al-
gorithm (http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Minimac3) and SHAPEIT 
(www.shapeit.fr/) as the phasing method. Imputed markers were 
excluded from the analysis if they were monomorphic or their R2 sta-
tistics were below 0.3. The analysis included 153 genotyped and im-
puted SNPs in GALA II and 197 SNPs in SAGE. We excluded markers 
with minor allele frequency lower than 0.01, resulting in a final list of 
143 SNPs that overlapped between GALA II and SAGE. Global ances-
try was estimated using ADMIXTURE (76) for each individual. For 
African Americans, we assumed a two-population model of admix-
ture (European and African ancestry), and for Latinos, we assumed 
a three-population model (European, Native American, and African 
ancestry). Reference haplotypes were from the HapMap phase II CEU 
(European) and YRI (African), and 71 Native American individuals 
were genotyped on the Axiom LAT1 array as described previously 
(77). The association of each SNP with FEV1 was performed using 
linear regression in PLINK 1.9 (78, 79). Regression models were ad-
justed for asthma status, age, sex, and global ancestry. In GALA II, an 
additional variable of ethnicity was added as a covariate. P values pre-
sented are from two-sided testing, with an  of 0.05. The Bonferroni 
correction was applied to create a significance threshold corrected for 
multiple testing (Bonferroni threshold: 0.05/143 = 3.5 × 10−4). The re-
sults of GALA II and SAGE were combined with meta-analysis using 
METAL (80).
