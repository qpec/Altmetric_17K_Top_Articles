Practical nutritional recovery strategies
for elite soccer players when limited
time separates repeated matches

Abstract
Specific guidelines that aim to facilitate the recovery of soccer players from the demands of training and a
congested fixture schedule are lacking; especially in relation to evidence-based nutritional recommendations. The
importance of repeated high level performance and injury avoidance while addressing the challenges of fixture
scheduling, travel to away venues, and training commitments requires a strategic and practically feasible method
of implementing specific nutritional strategies. Here we present evidence-based guidelines regarding nutritional
recovery strategies within the context of soccer. An emphasis is placed on providing practically applicable
guidelines for facilitation of recovery when multiple matches are played within a short period of time (i.e. 48 h).
Following match-play, the restoration of liver and muscle glycogen stores (via consumption of ~1.2 g⋅kg−1⋅h−1 of
carbohydrate) and augmentation of protein synthesis (via ~40 g of protein) should be prioritised in the first 20 min
of recovery. Daily intakes of 6–10 g⋅kg−1 body mass of carbohydrate are recommended when limited time
separates repeated matches while daily protein intakes of >1.5 g⋅kg−1 body mass should be targeted; possibly in
the form of multiple smaller feedings (e.g., 6 × 20–40 g). At least 150% of the body mass lost during exercise
should be consumed within 1 h and electrolytes added such that fluid losses are ameliorated. Strategic use of
protein, leucine, creatine, polyphenols and omega-3 supplements could also offer practical means of enhancing
post-match recovery.

Background
Over the course of a 45 week season, professional European
soccer teams may play in excess of 60 competitive
matches [1, 2] and thus at specific times of the year,
multiple matches will be played within a single week
[1]. Notwithstanding the additional match demands of
the pre-season period, it is common for players to com-
pete in 2–3 matches within an 8 day period (see Fig. 1
for a typical weekly schedule for an English Premier
League team) on multiple occasions throughout the
season. It should be noted that the notion of limited re-
covery between soccer matches is not unique to the
English Premier League as fixture congestion is also
common among U.S. University teams as well as youth
teams who play multiple games in a weekend. Up to
120 h are required to restore disturbances in metabolic
and physical performance indices that result from
soccer match-play [3]. Injury risk has been observed to
increase when less than 96 h separates games [1, 2] and
the reduced recovery time between matches played in
FIFA World Cup competitions is perceived to be a
primary cause of injury in professional soccer players
[4]. Therefore, the ability to facilitate post-match recov-
ery is desirable.
Accumulated fatigue can arise from a repetition of
matches and training performed within a short period of
time (e.g., daily training with matches separated by
~48 h; 5). The demands of a congested fixture schedule
means that recovery duration may sometimes be less
than optimal when seeking to maintain physical per-
formance and a low injury rate. Indeed, a reported 6.2-
fold higher injury rate occurred in players who played

 two matches a week compared to one and the majority
of these injuries (i.e., 76%) were reported to be caused
by overuse [5]. As muscle injuries constitute almost
one third of the time lost in men’s professional soccer
[6], it appears that amassed fatigue during a congested
fixture period may contribute to both underperform-
ance and/or elevated injury risk [3]; particularly in the
final 15 min of a match [7]. Notably, when three games
are played within a week, repeated sprint performance
is compromised (more so after the second game) and
muscle soreness is increased, knee range of motion is
impaired, and muscle damage, oxidative stress, and
inflammatory markers are perturbed [8]. While it must
be acknowledged that the extent of exposure to periods
of match congestion in professional soccer players may
be limited [9], when such periods do occur, perform-
ance is likely compromised and injury risk may be
elevated [7].
A number of interventions have been proposed to
facilitate post-exercise recovery, including, but not
limited to: cold water immersion, active recovery, com-
pression garments, massage and electrical stimulation
[10]; many of which are routinely used by professional
soccer teams. However, nutritional strategies are amongst
the most popular and accessible methods of facilitating
restoration of performance and physiological perturba-
tions following soccer-specific exercise. Despite the popu-
larity of soccer, surprisingly few guidelines exist that seek
to address the practical application of nutrition for recov-
ery from soccer when limited time (e.g., ~48 h) separates
matches. The importance of optimised recovery strategies
is particularly prevalent when congested fixture periods
exist and implementation of them may be complicated by
logistical issues such as late fixture times and demanding
travel schedules. Therefore, the purpose of this review was
to evaluate current knowledge regarding nutritional recov-
ery strategies within the context of soccer. Our emphasis
is on providing contextually relevant recommendations
for facilitation of post-exercise recovery when multiple
matches are played within a short period of time. We
present practical strategies relating to the composition,
quantity and timing of nutritional intake for the elite soc-
cer player wishing to improve their recovery via evidence-
based dietary strategies. Practical issues concerning the
implementation of such strategies within the elite environ-
ment are also considered.

 Characterising the demands of soccer match-play
Soccer is a physically demanding intermittent sport
which consists of recurrent high-intensity running, in-
tensive soccer-specific actions and requirements for a
high endurance capacity [11]. The game demands an ability
to intersperse repeated actions at maximal or near-maximal
intensity with periods of low-to-moderate intensity (includ-
ing active recovery or passive rest) [12]. Accordingly, both
anaerobic and aerobic energy pathways are required during
match-play [11] as players typically cover distances of 9–
12 km, and perform ~1350 activities (including a change of
movement every 4–6 s) while executing ~220 runs at high
speed [11] over 90 min; responses which may be exacer-
bated by involvement in extra-time [13, 14] in tournament
scenarios.
Mean energy expenditure for soccer match-play has
been estimated to be ~1106 kcal [15], and between 3439
and 3822 kcal·day−1 for players undertaking daily training
[16, 17]. Using the doubly labelled water technique,
English Premier League soccer players have exhibited a
state of energy balance (i.e., matching energy intake and
expenditure: 3186 ± 368 vs 3566 ± 585 kcal·day−1, respect-
ively; [18], yet previous data from youth soccer players
and using estimated markers of energy balance do not
support such findings [19, 20]. Indeed, in youth players it
has been reported that a mean daily energy deficit of
310 ± 399 kcal·day−1 is common and heavy training days
and matches result in the largest energy deficits of
502 ± 533 kcal·day−1 [19]. It has also been reported that
carbohydrate intake on a match-day and in the time pre-
ceding match-play was less than optimal [18]. While
highlighting a possible performance-enhancement strategy
to a single match, the implications of such practices may
be compounded when multiple matches are played with a
short turn-around time as the recovery nutrition in pro-
fessional players may be compromised [18].
Similarly, in players with energy intakes that fail to
balance expenditure, the predisposition of injury, ac-
centuation of fatigue and suppression of the immune
system may occur [21, 22]. On a day to day basis, there
are large changes in energy expenditure depending on
the type, intensity and duration of training [23]. Moreover,
variability exists in the activity and energy demands of
players that are dependent on the individual and position
played within a team; both of which can be dictated by
extraneous factors such as tactical role, quality of oppon-
ent, style of playing, and environmental factors [11]. It is
therefore important that players periodise energy and
macronutrient intake, particularly carbohydrate, according
to requirements.
The importance of carbohydrate for soccer has been
acknowledged since the early 1970’s when muscle biopsy
techniques identified
compromised muscle glycogen
stores following soccer match-play; a finding which had
negative ramifications for performance [24]. Indeed, a
better between-half maintenance of total distance cov-
ered and higher movement intensities were achieved by
players starting the game with higher muscle glycogen
concentrations [24]. More recent studies have demonstrated
a fibre-specific reduction in muscle glycogen concen-
tration [25] with knee extensor maximal voluntary acti-
vation and peak torque responses shown to also be
reduced [26]. Accordingly, over the course of 90 min,
the intensity and frequency of explosive actions tend to
reduce, resulting in a transient decline in physical per-
formance [3]. Likewise, a high degree of muscle damage
occurs as a result of exhaustive intermittent activities
and regular unexpected changes of direction [27]. Con-
sequently, refuelling and recovery nutrition are crucial
components to promote muscle recovery and glycogen
resynthesis. Additionally, recovery modalities and the
nutrient intake/timing approach need to be strategically
integrated to fully maximise muscle recovery and
soccer-specific adaptations.
Recovery nutrition strategies
A clearly planned nutritional strategy can likely assist
practitioners to facilitate the replenishing of glycogen
stores, acceleration of muscle-damage repair and en-
hanced rehydration; all of which seek to improve subse-
quent performance. Commencing the immediate recovery
phase as close to the end of the match as is reasonably
possible will likely confer beneficial effects before continu-
ation for several hours after until sleep occurs.
Refuelling after a match – The immediate recovery phase
The main focus immediately after a match is to replenish
both liver and muscle glycogen stores through ingestion
of adequate carbohydrate. For optimum glycogen resyn-
thesis it is a prudent strategy to consume carbohydrate
immediately after a game as glycogen-synthesising en-
zymes are most active during this time [28]; thus there is a
potential ‘window of opportunity’ that players should seek
to take advantage of. Indeed, when compared to immedi-
ate carbohydrate ingestion, delaying carbohydrate feeding
until 2 h after exercise can result in lower muscle glycogen
concentrations by 45% when assessed 4 h post-exercise
[28]. Thus players should be encouraged to consume a re-
covery drink and/or snacks as soon as possible after a
match ends. This can be achieved practically by providing
several opportunities to consume carbohydrate-electrolyte
drinks on the pitch, in the media suites for post-match in-
terviews and in the changing rooms.
The amount and frequency of carbohydrate ingested is
an important factor to consider during the immediate
recovery period (i.e., within 20 min of match-play).
Generally, the ingestion of 1–1.5 g·kg−1·h−1 of carbohy-
drate has been shown to benefit maximal glycogen
Ranchordas et al. Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition  (2017) 14:35 
Page 3 of 14
 resynthesis in the first 4 h post-exercise [29]. Therefore,
based on the upper limit of this recommendation, an
80 kg player would be advised to consume ~96 g of carbo-
hydrate per hour in the hours after a game finishes, with a
particular emphasis on achieving such rates during
times of fixture congestion. Furthermore, during this
initial stage of recovery, a strategy of frequent ingestion
of carbohydrate (i.e., every 30 min) has been shown to
induce greater glycogen resynthesis rates compared to a
less regular (i.e., every 2 h) protocol [30]. Similarly,
adding 0.2–0.5 g⋅kg−1⋅day−1 of protein to carbohydrate
has been shown to stimulate glycogen resynthesis to a
greater extent than consuming carbohydrate alone [31] but
only when carbohydrate intake is less than 1.2 g⋅kg−1⋅day−1.
It has been suggested that high glycaemic index (GI) foods
may be preferable over moderate and low GI foods
when the goal is to restore glycogen as quickly as
possible [32–34].
The consumption of adequate quantities of carbohy-
drate in this post-match phase is likely the most beneficial
aspect of carbohydrate recommendations. Accordingly,
support staff should seek to provide food and drinks that
are both tempting and practical to eat (see Tables 1, 2 and 3
for practical examples). Food options should be promoting
a desire to eat such that sufficient amounts in agreement
with recommended values are realised as a loss of appetite
may exist in some players in the time shortly after matches.
Support staff should ascertain the types of foods players are
likely to eat in this immediate recovery phase as players
may have individual cultural preferences.
The type of carbohydrate recommended in the imme-
diate phase of recovery is high GI foods (see Table 1 for
examples). High GI sources are proven to accelerate
muscle glycogen resynthesis rates in the first 6 h of re-
covery compared to low GI sources, most likely due to
malabsorption of low GI carbohydrate-rich foods [35].
However, the effect of high GI carbohydrate meals on
subsequent soccer-specific performance still remains un-
clear, with no difference observed between high and low
GI diets on endurance and sprint performance 24 h after
90 min of intermittent exercise [36]. It is the player’s
preference that should drive the decision as to whether
solid or liquid forms of carbohydrate are ingested as
both appear equally effective for muscle glycogen restor-
ation [37].
From a practical perspective, the consumption of high
amounts of carbohydrate required from food sources can
bring about gastrointestinal problems so it is important
that players have access to a mixture of fluid and solid
foods to prevent such issues [38]. There is evidence to
suggest that multiple transportable carbohydrates in the
form of glucose and fructose increases gastric empting
and fluid delivery compared to glucose only [39, 40] thus
drinks provided at the end of the match should contain
multiple transportable carbohydrates. Due to the fact that
liquid carbohydrate solutions can contribute to rehydra-
tion in conjunction with exogenous carbohydrate supply,
carbohydrate-containing fluids may be more preferable
for immediate ingestion when compared to solid foods. A
selection of high GI drinks and snacks should be readily
available in the changing room after a game (refer to Table
1 for a selection of recommended carbohydrate foods).
The co-ingestion of protein with carbohydrate has
proven beneficial in the context of glycogen resynthesis
when sub-optimal carbohydrate amounts were consumed
via an augmentation of postprandial insulin secretion [41].
A similar increase in glycogen synthetic rate has been
observed when 0.4 g·kg−1·h−1 of protein was added to
0.8 g·kg−1·h−1 of carbohydrate relative to ingesting
1.2 g·kg−1·h−1 of carbohydrate alone [30]. The inclusion
of protein to sufficient carbohydrate intakes is advisable to
aid glycogen re-synthesis and enhance muscle tissue repair

Strategy
Food Choices
• Start to consume carbohydrate as soon as possible after the cessation
of exercise taking full advantage of a ‘window of opportunity’ where
high rates of glycogen storage present in the muscle.
• Aim to ingest a recovery snack or meal that provides approximately
1 g·kg−1 body mass (e.g. 80 g for 80 kg player) per hour during the
first 4 h of recovery until normal eating patterns are resumed.
• This strategy should be implemented after a high intensity
fuel-depleting session or game when muscle fuel stores need to
be fully maximised in a short time period before the next
demanding exercise bout.
• Provide food and drinks that are both tempting and practical to
eat that are appetite promoting so that the player will consume
sufficient amounts to meet their fuel targets. The food provided
could vary according to the environment in which the game is
played as well as the time of the day. Support staff should ascertain
the types of foods players are likely to eat in this immediate recovery
phase as players may have individual cultural preferences.
• Creatine ingestion with carbohydrate will help restore important
phosphocreatine stores in this short period.
Recovery snacks containing 50 g of CHO:
- 250–350 ml of milk-shake or fruit smoothie
- 2 slices toast/bread/bagel with jam, banana or honey topping
- 2 cereal bars
- Large (300 g) baked potato with filling
- 2 sport gels
- 700-800 ml of sports drink
- Fruit salad with 200 g of yoghurt
- Sandwich with meat filling
- Sports bar (check the label for content)
- Rice cakes
- Tortilla wraps with filling
- Medium bowl of baked sweet potato wedges
- A medium bag of popcorn
- Thin base pizza slices (i.e., tortilla) with mixed toppings
- Panini’s with mixed fillings

 [42] (see Table 1). As milk or flavoured milk naturally
contains a mixture of carbohydrate and protein, it may
positively influence recovery and is likely a good choice of
recovery beverage for lactose-tolerant players [43, 44].
Refuelling after a match - daily recovery between games
During a congested week (see Fig. 1), it is important
to implement a carbohydrate feeding strategy that not
only replenishes endogenous fuel stores but also seeks
to fully maximise muscle glycogen concentrations in
preparation for the next game as the 48 h post-
exercise recovery period may also coincide with the
48 h period leading into the subsequent match. Opti-
mal performance can largely be attributed to carbohy-
drate availability [45]. Notably, players consuming a
high carbohydrate diet (10 g·kg−1·day−1 for one week
improved repeated high intensity intermittent per-
formance compared to players on a mixed diet (5 g·kg
−1·day−1carbohydrate; [46]. However, recent soccer-
specific literature has failed to report an increase in
glycogen concentrations above pre-match levels 48 h
after a game, despite the ingestion of a high carbohy-
drate diet of up to 10 g·kg−1·day−1 [11, 47]. Similarly, a
carbohydrate rich diet with whey protein ingestion
failed to increase glycogen resynthesis when compared
to a normal diet [25]. Therefore, supercompensation
of muscle glycogen concentrations has yet to be re-
ported 48 h after a game; a response which is typically
seen in sports such as cycling [48]. This may be attrib-
uted to the high eccentric component involved in
soccer-specific movements with resulting muscle dam-
age impairing glycogen resynthesis during recovery
[47]. Fast twitch-muscle fibres in particular, had lower
glycogen content in comparison to slow twitch fibres
48 h after a high carbohydrate diet [25]. Practically
this could have implications on recovery time scale for
the more ‘explosive’ players in the team who have a
higher composition of these fibres in the muscle but
more research is warranted in this area.
While carbohydrate recovery strategies in the 48 h
after a game are less clear than endurance sports, it is
difficult to recommend exact guidelines for the amount
for optimal recovery. Nevertheless, a general guideline of
6–10 g·kg−1·day−1 is a prudent aim for elite soccer
players in the days of muscle glycogen recovery/loading.
This could be achieved through 3–4 main meals and
regular carbohydrate snacking interspersed throughout
the day (Table 1). This nutritional approach, coupled
with acutely modulating training intensity and duration,
will likely increase the availability of carbohydrate in
the body in a week that involves 3 games in a 7-day
period.
Repair and adaptation after a match – The immediate
recovery phase
Exercise increases both muscle protein breakdown and
protein synthesis [49]. However, prolonged periods of
negative protein balance may result if synthesis rates
are not periodically elevated through dietary protein
consumption; a scenario that the elite player should
seek to avoid when fixtures are congested. The effects
of a high amount of eccentric actions during match-
play, as well as impacts from tackles and challenges
with the opposition, results in impaired muscle func-
tion [50] that must be restored. To repair damaged
muscle fibres and stimulate molecular adaptation, the
post-match nutrition strategy should target the promo-
tion of protein synthesis and attenuation of muscle
breakdown. It has recently been shown that consuming
40 g of protein rather than just 20 g after exercise stim-
ulates greater myofibrillar protein synthesis irrespective
of the lean body mass of the individual [51]. Thus, the
consumption of 40 g of protein as a post-match serving
seems to enhance protein synthesis rates relative to
smaller doses examined previously [52, 53].
Ultimately, protein-requirements should be achieved
through high quality protein meals and snacks in the diet
(see Table 2). However, appetite can sometimes be sup-
pressed following high intensity exercise so liquid supple-
ments can be provided as an alternative for players who
cannot eat solid foods. In this respect, whey protein has
proven to be a superior source in comparison to soy or
casein when taken in isocaloric amounts [54]. This is due
to its quicker digestive properties and rapid absorption
kinetics. It also contains a high proportion of the key
amino acid leucine, which is believed to be the main
Table 2 Repair and Adaptation for the Immediate Recovery Phase 0–4 h
Strategy
Food Choices
• Ingest a protein-rich high quality source that provides 30–40 g of
protein (containing 6–9 g of essential amino acids) as soon as possible
after exercise. Leucine in particular is an important amino acid for its
anabolic stimulating properties.
• Plan a feeding pattern which includes this optimal protein serving of
20–25 g along with other nutritional goals every 3–5 h to fully maximise
recovery in the immediate phase.
• Have a protein-rich snack before bed, which preferably contains
casein (e.g. 200 g of cottage cheese or 40 g in a liquid supplement)
to optimise protein synthesis overnight.
Rapidly digested protein sources containing 10 g to have in the immediate
recovery phase:
- 300 ml milk, milkshake, flavoured milk
- 20–30 g high protein sports bar (quantities dependent on the brand)
- 10–15 g whey-based protein powder (quantities dependent on
the brand)
- 200 g Greek-style yogurt
- 250 ml of low-fat custard

 trigger for muscle protein synthesis augmentation [55].
Animal proteins such as chicken, beef and fish can also
contain a high amount of this key amino acid.
Using protein supplements can be a convenient strategy
for many athletes. As previously discussed, whey protein
is superior to soy and casein sources because of its rapid
digestion and higher leucine content [54]. That said,
plasma aminoacidemia is higher following the ingestion
of liquid versus solid protein sources [56]; therefore,
post-game benefits of fluid-based protein ingestion may

Rationale
Practical application
Refuelling (post match) / Pre-Loading
(pre match)
A player should aim to consume approximately
6–10 g·kg−1 of body mass (e.g. 480–800 g for an
80 kg player) of carbohydrates on the days
where both muscle recovery/loading is needed
(24–72 h between games). This should be
coupled with a reduction in training
volume/intensity.
This is to be achieved through 3–4 main meals
and regular carbohydrate snacking spaced out
throughout the day.
Fuel intake should match the demands of energy
expended. Players who have been an unused sub
or only played part of a game do not require the
same level of energy intake as players who played
the whole game. Taking in more energy than
required could lead to weight gain.
• Carbohydrate sources to include as part of a nutritious
meal:
• Grains (quinoa, pasta, rice, noodles and couscous)
• Starchy vegetables (potatoes), Legumes (beans and
lentils), Fruits
• Cereals (porridge, muesli)
• Label foods appropriately to nudge players to increase
carbohydrate portion for both match day −1 as well as
post-match
• Convenient food such as sweet potato wedges, chicken
coated in breadcrumbs, and chicken burritos served
post-match can increase uptake due to convenience
Maintenance of Repair and
Adaptation
Daily intake post match before
subsequent fixture
During intensified periods of competition a
recommended strategy of 1.5 g·kg−1 -2 g·kg−1
body weight per day (e.g. 120–160 g for 80 kg
player) should be sufficient to fully repair
damaged muscle and stimulate soccer specific
adaptation.
Meals and snacks should be divided into
6 × 20–25 g protein servings over the day,
interspersed by roughly 3 h to fully maximise
protein synthesis rates in the days between
competition.
Protein sources containing 10 g protein (add to
carbohydrate sources for high quality recovery meals):
• 40 g of cooked chicken, lean beef, lamb or pork.
• 300 ml milk
• 2 small eggs
• 30 g of reduced fat cheese
• 120 g tofu or soy meat
• 50 g canned tuna or salmon or grilled fish
Rehydration
Immediate Recovery
Rehydration should occur as soon after exercise
finishes. A player should aim to intake a volume
that is approximately 150–200% of the estimated
deficit to account of ongoing losses (e.g. urine
output) with a rough guide of 1 kg weight
lost = 1.5 l of fluid required.
They should aim to replace the volume lost within
2–4 h post exercise over regular time period to
prevent the gastrointestinal distress associated
with large fluid intakes.
Key electrolytes need to be replaced – principally
sodium – and this can be achieved either through
electrolyte containing drinks or consuming fluids
with ‘salty’ foods.
Excessive alcohol consumption must be avoided
as it is counterproductive to overall recovery goals.
Ultimately fluid choices need to be palatable, suit the
other recovery needs of the player, practiced and are
practical within their recovery environment:
• Sports drinks containing electrolytes and carbohydrate
• Milk based drinks/supplements which include other
nutrients
• Fruit juices
• Cola drinks, tea and coffee could provide a valuable
source of fluid and should not be totally avoided
• Only have water if salty snacks are consumed at the
same time
Reduce inflammation and muscle
soreness
Immediate Recovery
During intensified fixture congestion antioxidants
and anti-inflammatory food components or
supplements can modulate the inflammatory
reaction may prove beneficial in the acute
recovery phase.
Concentrated tart cherry juice and omega-3
fish oil supplements are two supplements which
may have accelerate recovery time but further
research is warranted in elite team sports.
It is important to note that any form of
antioxidant or anti-inflammatory supplement
should be carefully dosed. Soccer-specific
adaptations are triggered by the inflammatory
and redox reactions occurring after a strenuous
exercise stimulus.
Dietary sources of antioxidants include the majority of
fruits and vegetables. High antioxidant containing
foods for example:
• Blueberries, Prunes, Blueberries, Sprouts, Broccoli,
Raspberry, Sweet cherry
Dietary sources contain omega −3:
• Oily fish, beans, Flax seeds, Walnuts

 be realised. A ready to drink formulation may also have
a greater practical appeal to players post-game.
Leucine is an essential amino acid which through the
activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex
(mTOR) signalling pathway may in part attenuate the
decrease in muscle protein synthesis after exercise [57].
It is present in high quality proteins and it has been re-
ported that 3 g of leucine is capable of enhancing muscle
resistance to insulin through muscle protein synthesis
activation [58]. This amount can be obtained through
dietary sources such as 140 g of chicken, 170 g of fish or
20–25 g of whey protein, but it can also be ingested as
an isolated supplement.
Repair and adaptation after a match - daily recovery
between games
After the initial intake of protein in the hours after a game,
it is important for the player to continue maximising their
protein synthesis over subsequent days to support recovery
and adaptation. Players should be strongly encouraged to
include sources of protein in their meals with the amount
of protein required daily being dependent on the severity of
the player’s physical programme. Although a sedentary
male is recommended to consume 0.8–1.2 g·kg−1·day−1 of
protein to achieve nitrogen balance, elite soccer players will
require more to support their intensified workload during
busy periods. For example, a daily protein intake in the
range of 2.3 g·kg−1·day−1 body mass (BM) has shown to
better maintain muscle mass when there is an energy
deficit [59]. Furthermore, when protein intake was ele-
vated from 1.5 g·kg−1·day−1 to 3 g·kg−1·day−1 immune
function was better preserved, resulting in less upper
respiratory tract infections and an overall tolerance of
strenuous training [60].
Although there is an absence in research relating to
daily protein intake for elite players during intensified pe-
riods, it would be prudent to recommend that at least
1.5–2 g·kg−1·day−1 of body mass of protein is consumed in
order to cope with demands of a congested fixture period.
In order to achieve this amount, an 80 kg player would re-
quire approximately 120–160 g of protein per day. Good
quality of protein sources such as meat and fish contain
around 25 g per 100 g and other sources such as milk,
nuts, yoghurt, and beans can contribute to this amount. It
has been reported that in elite academy players (U18 s)
that there is a skewed distribution of protein intake where
more protein is consumed for dinner (~0.6 g·kg−1) and
lunch (~0.5 g·kg−1) in comparison to breakfast (~0.3 g·kg
−1) [61]. Thus, in terms of the amount of protein con-
sumed over the day, meals or snacks should be divided
into 6 × 20–25 g (120–150 g of protein) feedings inter-
spersed by 3 h for stimulating maximal protein synthesis
throughout a 24 h period [62].
Rehydration after a match – The immediate recovery phase
Intense exercise during a game leads to an increase in
metabolic heat production which can raise muscle and
rectal temperature to above 39 °C [63]. The main physio-
logical mechanism to lose heat from the body is to evapor-
ate sweat on the skin surface, with losses of 2 L even
observed in lower ambient temperatures [64]. As a conse-
quence of this level of fluid loss, a player will become
dehydrated. For example, a 75 kg player with sweat losses
of >2 L will become dehydrated by >2%. Individual sweat
rates can range from 1.1 L to 3.1 L per 90 min [65], outlin-
ing the importance of player awareness of their own sweat
rate and to rehydrate accordingly post-exercise.
Immediately post-exercise is a period where rehydra-
tion strategies should be implemented in order to re-
place the volume and composition of important fluids
lost through sweat. Without adequate rehydration, nega-
tive effects on glycogen restoration and protein synthesis
rates [66], sprint capacity [67], and subsequent dribbling
performance [68] could prevail. It has been reported that
at least 150% of the fluid lost during exercise should be
consumed to account for a negative fluid balance and
urine fluid losses [69]. In practical terms, for every 1 kg
of weight lost during exercise would equate to 1.5 L of
fluid required post training and this can be monitored
through pre-post weighing by support staff.
Time taken to rehydrate is shorter than repletion of
muscle glycogen stores (up to 6 h compared to 48–72 h)
as long as sufficient fluid and electrolytes are consumed.
Although, rehydration may take less time than glycogen
re-synthesis, it should be noted that during periods of fix-
ture congestion, especially where teams are playing back
to back away fixtures where significant travel is required,
it is important to educate players how best to re-hydrate
during travel. Moreover, it is not unusual for teams to
train 24 h after a match as well as 24 h before a match,
placing even greater emphasis on rehydration. Moreover,
players should be encouraged to take on adequate fluids
during half-time (i.e. 200–300 mL) and throughout the
match when opportunities such as a break in play are ap-
parent, to maintain hydration. This is especially important
during hot and humid weather conditions.
Sodium is a key electrolyte that should be replaced for
optimum fluid restoration. There is a variation amongst
players in terms of sodium lost during a game with a re-
ported loss of 10 g of sodium chloride observed during a
90 min soccer session [70]. The consumption of a high
sodium drink containing 61 mmol of sodium in volumes
equivalent to 150–200% of sweat loss was sufficient to
establish a state of hyperhydration 6 h after ingestion
[71]. The optimal sodium level during rehydration could
be as high as 50–80 mmol·L−1 which exceeds the amounts
found in a typical sports drink [72]. Water is an electrolyte
free drink and is not ideal for rehydration post-exercise as
Ranchordas et al. Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition  (2017) 14:35 
Page 7 of 14
 a rapid reduction in plasma sodium concentration could
ensure which subsequently increases urine output [73].
Therefore, drinks for rehydration should have high electro-
lyte content (i.e. 40 or 50 mmol·L−1 of sodium chloride)
and consist of carbohydrate sources to increase palatability
[74] and help with glycogen restoration. In this respect,
sports drinks are superior to water for fluid restoration due
to their provision of both carbohydrate and electrolytes.
Team sports such as soccer can be associated with a
moderate to high post-match alcohol intake to cele-
brate or commiserate over the game result; especially in
the amateur game. Although this practice is slowly
diminishing at the elite level, alcohol consumption can
negatively affect a player’s ability to recover especially
when consumed during periods of fixture congestion
[75]. More specifically, alcohol has recently been shown
to reduce myofibrillar protein synthesis rates even if
coingested with protein, resulting in an impairment of
recovery and adaptation from exercise by suppressing
skeletal muscle anabolic responses [75]. Moreover, alco-
hol consumed after a match can also exacerbate dehy-
dration especially when consumed during the recovery
period several hours after a match [76]. Thus it is pru-
dent to educate players regarding the negative effects of
alcohol on recovery when multiple matches are played
within a short period of time.
Overnight recovery following match-play
Recovery nutrition towards the end of a day during
periods of fixture congestion as well as intensive training
is often overlooked by athletes. For instance, protein
ingested before sleep has proven to be effectively digested
and absorbed, leading to an increase in protein synthesis
and improving whole-body protein balance during over-
night recovery [49]. Ingesting a pre-sleep protein snack
high in casein such as 200 g of cottage cheese or alterna-
tively, a formulated protein supplement containing 40 g of
casein protein will likely prove beneficial for increasing
the time in a net-positive anabolic state over the course of
a day [77]. This is due to its slow release properties over a
prolonged sleeping period. The absence of this pre-sleep
feed will not improve overnight protein balance; possibly
compromising muscle protein synthesis rates over the
24 h period. A summary of the recovery nutrition guide-
lines have been summarised in Table 3.
Supplements and recovery
Fundamentally, macro and micro nutrients should come
primarily from food sources in the diet; however, players
may require a constituent, metabolite, concentrate or ex-
tract in isolation that is difficult to source in quantities re-
quired from food [78]. While energy consumption from
supplements in professional soccer has not been studied,
it has been reported that in professional Rugby League
players approximately 16% of energy intake came from
the use of supplements such as pre-exercise energy drinks,
carbohydrate drinks, and recovery drinks [79]. It is im-
portant to emphasise that supplements should be con-
sumed to ‘supplement’ a healthy diet and not to replace it.
Moreover, elite players should be cautious with supple-
ments and only take batch tested products that have been
tested for banned substances. Specific guidelines have yet
to be developed with limited research available for the use
of some supplements, especially in the context of recovery
from elite soccer match-play during periods of fixture
congestion. Nevertheless, supplement use during this
short recovery phase has become common practice in
soccer clubs across a range of ages. Immediately after a
match and several hours afterwards, feeding a team with
nutritious food can be problematic and therefore certain
supplements can be convenient to enhance recovery. A
brief review of popular products is provided in this section
with reference to their application for recovery.
Carbohydrate and protein supplements
Carbohydrate and protein supplements can be both use-
ful and practical for players to enhance recovery during
periods of fixture congestion. We have previously dis-
cussed both the importance and practical application of
carbohydrate and protein supplements under the “recov-
ery nutrition strategies” section.
Creatine
During repeated soccer-specific actions phosphocreatine
stores diminish significantly as a consequence of adeno-
sine triphosphate regeneration through phosphocreatine
hydrolysis in the initial seconds of supra-maximal activ-
ity [80]. To increase resting muscle phosphocreatine
stores quickly, a creatine loading protocol can be used
with the conventional strategy involving 4 × 5 g doses of
creatine supplementation per day for 5–7 days pro-
ceeded by a maintenance dose of 3–5 g per day [81].
However, a lower daily dose of ~3 g per day for 28 days
will result in a similar increase in phosphocreatine stores
[81] to the loading protocol. It has been reported that
muscle glycogen resynthesis can be enhanced following
creatine loading [82]. Practically, creatine can be added
to the post-match and post-training recovery drink and
it may prove beneficial in optimising refuelling strategies
especially during congested fixture schedules.
In agreement with data from the general population [83],
empirical observations highlight that sleep deprivation is
common on the night(s) prior to sporting competition; es-
pecially, if matches require prior international air travel.
Interestingly, players who self-reported 7–9 h sleep on the
night before testing outperformed their sleep-deprived
counterparts (i.e., those reporting 3–5 h sleep) by ~20% in
a
rugby
passing
task
[84].
Such
differences
were
Ranchordas et al. Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition  (2017) 14:35 
Page 8 of 14
 ameliorated when creatine (50 or 100 mg·kg−1) or caffeine
(1 or 5 mg·kg−1) was provided to sleep-deprived players
90 min before skill testing commenced; a response attrib-
uted to the attenuation of sleep-deprivation induced reduc-
tions in brain phosphocreatine concentrations and the
stimulatory effects of adenosine-receptors, respectively [84].
Caffeine
There is some evidence that large amounts of caffeine
taken with carbohydrate can enhance glycogen resynthesis
post-exercise [85, 86]. Pederson and colleagues [85] found
that co-ingestion of carbohydrate and caffeine (4 g·kg−1
and 8 mg·kg−1, respectively) resulted in greater glycogen
resynthesis compared to 4 g·kg−1 of body mass of carbohy-
drate only. Muscle biopsy data showed that although no
differences were observed in glycogen resynthesis after 1 h
post-exercise (133–37.8 vs. 149–48 mmol·kg−1 dry weight;
for carbohydrate and caffeine, respectively), after 4 h of
recovery the caffeine condition resulted in a 66% higher
glycogen accumulation (313–69 vs. 234–50 mmol/kg dry
weight; p < 0.001). Similarly, Taylor et al. [86] found that
co-ingestion of carbohydrate and caffeine (1.2 g·kg−1 and
8 mg·kg−1, respectively) resulted in an increased time to
exhaustion on the Loughborough Intermittent Shuttle
Test compared with the carbohydrate only and water con-
dition. Although Taylor et al. [86] did not take any muscle
biopsy data to measure glycogen resynthesis, the authors
concluded that adding 8 mg·kg−1 of caffeine to a post-
exercise carbohydrate drink improved subsequent high-
intensity interval-running capacity, a finding that may be
related to higher rates of post-exercise muscle glycogen
resynthesis. Whilst the findings of Pedersen et al. [85] and
Taylor et al. [86] may be useful for recovery, as they
suggest that adding large doses of caffeine to carbohydrate
post-exercise can enhance glycogen resynthesis, this
strategy may not always be practical, particularly when
matches kick off either late afternoon or evening as this
strategy will compromise sleep. Nonetheless, this strategy
could be employed for matches that have early kick off
times.
Antioxidants and polyphenols
When time is limited between games, dietary components
that modulate the inflammatory process may prove bene-
ficial in the acute recovery phase. However, it is important
to note that any form of antioxidant or anti-inflammatory
supplement should be carefully dosed. Soccer-specific
adaptations are triggered by the inflammatory and redox
reactions occurring after a strenuous exercise stimulus.
Therefore, chronically high doses in their provision are
likely to be detrimental to the long term training effect
[87]. For example, large doses of vitamins C and E have
proven to have detrimental effects to cellular adaptation
[88,
89].
Strategic
use
of
anti-inflammatory
and
antioxidant foods/supplements in and around periods of
heavy training/game scheduling is the best approach for
optimal recovery, rather than chronic daily use.
Antioxidant- and polyphenol-rich foods such as cherry
and pomegranate juice have been found to enhance recov-
ery following heavy training [90–94]. For example, 0.682 L
a day of tart cherry juice consumption before and after ec-
centric exercise significantly reduced symptoms of muscle
damage [95]. Similarly, Montmorency cherry juice has also
been shown to enhance recovery following prolonged,
repeat sprint activity in semi-professional male soccer
players [91]. In addition, 500 mL of pomegranate juice has
been shown to reduce DOMS after strenuous exercise [92,
94]. However, these findings should be interpreted with
some caution as participants were fasted and restricted
polyphenol based foods beforehand. Theaflavin-enriched
black tea extract supplementation in doses of 1760 mg
daily for nine days has also been found to enhance
recovery, reduce oxidative stress reduce muscle soreness
in response to acute anaerobic intervals [96]. Thus, the
potential beneficial effects of antioxidants and polyphenols
to accelerate recovery are encouraging but more research
is warranted using protocols which demonstrate greater
ecological validity, especially in relation to soccer specific
activity. Nevertheless, in situations where players have
back-to-back matches with little time for recovery or in
tournament situations where adaptation to training is
likely not a key priority, certain antioxidant supplements
and polyphenol-rich foods may be beneficial for recovery
but chronic use should be avoided.
Omega-3 supplementation
Omega-3 is found naturally in oily fish such as salmon,
mackerel and sardines, and in a more concentration
form as a fish oil supplement. Fish oil supplements
contain the long chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty
acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic
acid (DHA). It should be noted that the research on
Omega-3 fatty acid supplements is conflicting as some
studies show beneficial effects on reducing inflammation
[97] and delayed onset muscle soreness [98–100], whereas,
other show no benefit [101, 102]. Phillips and colleagues
[97] found that fish oil supplementation reduced exercise-
induced inflammation. Similarly, other studies have found
that 1.8 g [98], 2.7 g [100], and 3 g [99] of Omega-3 fatty
acid supplementation reduced DOMS after exercise. In
contrast, other studies have found a reduction in oxida-
tive stress following exercise with fish oil supplementa-
tion but no difference in DOMS [102] and further
studies have no effect on DOMS [101]. Despite the in-
consistencies regarding fish oil supplementation, there
does seem to be some evidence for using Omega-3 fatty
acid supplementation in doses of 1.8 to 3 g per day to
Ranchordas et al. Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition  (2017) 14:35

 reduce inflammation and muscle soreness after matches,
especially during periods of fixture congestion.
Practical considerations in elite soccer
Fixture scheduling possibly provides the biggest chal-
lenge to recovery in elite soccer. It is not unusual for top
teams to have 3 games in a 10 day period in 3 different
locations (see Fig. 1). The timing of kick offs in these
games varies from week to week as a consequence of in-
creased television coverage. For example, a team could
play a home match at 15:00 h on a Saturday, travel to
Europe to play an away match on Wednesday night at
19:45 h and return to play another away match at
12:45 h on the subsequent Saturday. It is these types of
scenarios where recovery strategies take on extra signifi-
cance. The selection of foods and timing of intake in
and around travel are critical factors for optimal recov-
ery. An example of recovery nutrition timeline after a
match is shown in Fig. 2. Support staff cannot always
rely on external catering thus some foods need to be
portable to away games without compromising on qual-
ity and in these situations, teams could take their own
chef who can work closely with the sport nutritionist to
devise suitable menus. Moreover, sleep deprivation will
become an issue as a result of late games so timing of
recovery nutrition to optimise sleep quality is of signifi-
cance and this has been reviewed elsewhere [103].
It is easy to formulate a recovery nutrition strategy on
paper but implementing it effectively and attaining player
adherence in the elite environment can prove a difficult
proposition. The role of a sports nutritionist and/or sport
science practitioner is to implement these recovery princi-
ples by adapting to certain practical restraints (see Table 4
for some practical issues and solutions). The practitioner
has to keep in mind that devotion to the right strategies
can optimise a player’s physical performance and reduce
the risk of fatigue-related injury. This is particularly impera-
tive during a period of congested fixtures where recovery
time between matches is limited.
At the elite level there is a mix of different cultures and
nationalities within a team dressing room but without an
empathy and understanding of this environment a player’s
match performance and adaptation to exercise can suffer
if recovery nutrition is inadequate. To counteract this, a
potential strategy could be to introduce a different inter-
national theme to recovery snacks/foods at certain points

 throughout the season for player engagement. This will
provide an additional food option during recovery without
compromising on the quality of nutrients.
For players, it would also be beneficial to set up a recov-
ery station and buffet style food selection in the changing
room after the game which incorporates high-quality
sources of carbohydrate and protein recovery snacks. This
strategy will ensure that recovery nutrition is readily avail-
able after a game before they travel home. It is common
practice for some players to quickly exit a game/training
almost immediately after exercise so it is important to
have this option available. If this option is avoided, a re-
covery ‘pack’ which contains recovery snacks and/or sup-
plements along with a timing plan could be provided for
any players who request; particularly encouraging those
who have a long way to travel home and won’t have access
to foods.
Support staff may also want to consider an indivi-
dualised approach to recovery nutrition based on
player position. With modern technology such as Glo-
bal Positioning System (GPS) and data obtained from
match
analysis
such
as
total
distance
and
high
intensity distance covered, recovery strategies could
be individualised. For example, players working at
higher intensities (typically the full backs, and attack-
ing midfielders) would increase the amount of carbo-
hydrate
within
the
immediate
recovery
phase.
Whereas, the goalkeepers would follow lower carbohy-
drate
diet

order

expenditures.
Conclusion
The growing match play and training demands of a
professional soccer player are putting a greater em-
phasis on the role of nutritional recovery in regaining
performance and reducing the risk of injury. Certain
dietary practices should commence immediately after a
competitive game or high intensity training session be-
fore the opportunity to fully optimise the recuperation
process diminishes. Carbohydrate replenishment should
take precedence to replace the fuel lost to perform high
intensity work with protein consumption playing an
important role in muscle repair and rehydration aiding
the overall recovery process. Daily strategies incorporating
Table 4 Practical issues that interfere with post-match recovery nutrition and solutions to counteract these concerns
Practical Issue
Practical Solution
Players within a team who are uneducated and have a detrimental
habit of poor quality nutrients during recovery
Educate the team on the importance of recovery nutrition; stressing the
beneficial role is had on performance and adaptation. Integrating backroom
staff (physiotherapists, coaches, doctor) into this education so that they can
re-enforce nutrition policies day to day. Use visuals around the training ground
to educate players key messages
Night games limit the time consume recovery nutrients before sleep
Ensure that recovery strategies are implemented every hour until sleep,
encouraging more liquid based nutrient sources (e.g. milkshakes, sport
supplement drink) to offset any potential gastrointestinal issues associated
with the ingestion of solid foods before bed. No caffeinated drinks (e.g. coffee,
cola) should be consumed pre-sleep, but a snack containing casein (slow
release protein) is important have before bedtime.
Travel to and from away games, sometimes internationally
Recovery snacks need to be carefully chosen so that they are portable and
able to travel internationally, without compromising on their quality (e.g. sports
bars). Planning is key, ensuring that foods are readily available during transit
(e.g. on the team bus or plane). A traveling chef can help enhance quality and
taste of meals provided during travel.
Players quickly exiting the stadium to travel home soon after the
end of a match (normally in their own car after home games)
Providing a buffet style food selection which provides high-quality sources
of mixed carbohydrate and protein snacks. Also, providing a recovery ‘pack’
which contains recovery snacks and/or supplements along with a timing
plan for players who have long to travel home.
Players who have been unused sub or not played any minutes
Monitor the minutes played/exercised at higher intensities for all players in
the squad. The energy demands and recovery requirements will vary between
each individual and should be adjusted accordingly so body composition
issues or an energy deficit do not arise. This can be communicated to players
using match data
Loss of appetite following high intensity activity
Liquid based nutrient sources such as milkshake and meal replacement shakes
should be encouraged to players who don’t have the appetite for food post-
match. Again, stress the importance of having recovery nutrition after a game,
highlighting the benefits for them as a soccer player (e.g. reduce the risk of
injury, improve subsequent performance).
Players choose nutrient-poor foods (i.e. chocolate bar or crisps)
because they are more accessible after exercise
Create a culture that promotes good nutrition by using visual displays at the
training ground or stadium changing room as well as face to face education.
Ensure that a recovery station is set up with high quality food choices (see
examples in Table 1) with buffet food selection post game.

 these key nutrients should become common practice on
subsequent recovery days between fixtures, especially dur-
ing congestive weeks. Antioxidants and other nutrients
can have a modulating role of the inflammatory process
during these busy periods but their use needs be strategic
rather than chronic to ensure adaptations to training are
not blunted. Current practical issues are ever present in
an elite environment and need to be counteracted to
achieve success in nutritional approach.
