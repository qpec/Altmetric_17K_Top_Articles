IMPORTANCE Capecitabine is an oral cytotoxic chemotherapeutic commonly used across
cancer subtypes. As with other oral medications though, it may suffer from drug interactions
that could impair its absorption.
OBJECTIVE To determine if gastric acid suppressants such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)
may impair capecitabine efficacy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This secondary analysis of TRIO-013, a phase III
randomized trial, compares capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CapeOx) with or without lapatinib in
545 patients with ERBB2/HER2-positive metastatic gastroesophageal cancer (GEC); patients
were randomized 1:1 between CapeOx with or without lapatinib. Proton pump inhibitor use
was identified by medication records. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
were compared between patients treated with PPIs vs patients who were not. Specific
subgroups were accounted for, such as younger age (<60 years), Asian ethnicity, female sex,
and disease stage (metastatic/advanced) in multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling.
The TRIO-013 trial accrued and randomized patients between June 2008 and January 2012;
this analysis took place in January 2014.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were divided based on PPI exposure.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary study outcome was PFS and OS between patients
treated with PPIs vs patients who were not. Secondary outcomes included disease response
rates and toxicities.
RESULTS Of the 545 patients with GEC (median age, 60 years; 406 men [74%]) included in
the study, 229 received PPIs (42.0%) and were evenly distributed between arms. In the
placebo arm, PPI-treated patients had poorer median PFS, 4.2 vs 5.7 months (hazard ratio
[HR], 1.55; 95% CI, 1.29-1.81, P < .001); OS, 9.2 vs 11.3 months (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.06-1.62;
P = .04); and disease control rate (72% vs 83%; P = .02) vs patients not treated with PPIs. In
multivariate analysis considering age, race, disease stage, and sex, PPI-treated patients had
poorer PFS (HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.42-1.94; P < .001) and OS (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.11-1.71; P = .001).
In patients treated with CapeOx and lapatinib, PPIs had less effect on PFS (HR, 1.08; P = .54)
and OS (HR, 1.26; P = .10); however, multivariate analysis in this group demonstrated a
significant difference in OS (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.06-1.66; P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Proton pump inhibitors negatively effected capecitabine
efficacy by possibly raising gastric pH levels, leading to altered dissolution and absorption.
These results are consistent with previous erlotinib and sunitinib studies. Whether PPIs
affected lapatinib is unclear given concurrent capecitabine. Given capecitabine’
s prevalence
in treatment breast cancer and colon cancer, further studies are under way.

 P
rognosis of advanced or metastatic gastric cancer has
remained consistently poor over time.1 Amplification
or overexpression of human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (ERBB2/HER2) occurs in 7% to 34% of gastric can-
cers, making trastuzumab, an anti-ERBB2/HER2 monoclonal
antibody, a viable therapy for ERBB2/HER2-positive gastro-
esophageal cancer (GEC).2 The ToGA trial3 found an improve-
ment in both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall sur-
vival (OS) when trastuzumab was combined with cisplatin and
capecitabine or fluorouracil in comparison with the chemo-
therapy alone. The clinical superiority of a doublet chemo-
therapy plus a biologic drug is questionable, however, owing
to nearly simultaneous reporting of improved outcomes of
combined next-generation cytotoxic chemotherapies, such as
oxaliplatin and capecitabine.4
Subsequent development of lapatinib, a small molecule ty-
rosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of ERBB2/HER2, led to further in-
vestigations of newer combinations. Given lapatinib’
s single-
agent activity in ERBB2/HER2 amplified disease,5 TRIO-013/
LOGiCinvestigatedcapecitabineandoxaliplatin(CapeOx)with
or without lapatinib in a phase III setting for patients with ad-
vanced and/or metastatic GEC whose disease overexpressed
ERBB2/HER2.6 A total of 545 patients were accrued and ran-
domizedequallyamongexperimentalandcontrolarms.Though
thelapatinib-containingarmhadbetterresponserates,thestudy
missed its primary and secondary end points of detecting sta-
tisticallysignificantOSandPFSimprovementswithlapatinibuse.
The focus in oncology therapeutics has intensified toward
targeted and oral options in hopes of improving efficacy while
limiting toxic effects. Oral therapeutics are popular with pa-
tients owing to convenience and an association with less stress
for patients,7 as well as potentially less institutional costs as in-
fusion time is lessend. An increasing body of literature has de-
velopedthatquestionspharmacokineticvariabilitybetweenpar-
enteral and oral administration. Specifically, a large number of
TKIs rely on pH-dependent solubility to dissolve within the
stomach and be subsequently absorbed.8 Much of these data
stem from preclinical data wherein gastric pH level elevations
can impair a TKI’
s ability to dissolve and ultimately reach sys-
temic circulation. In fact, recent retrospective data have found
that coadministration of gastric acid suppressants such as pro-
ton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or histamine receptor antagonists
(H2RAs) with TKIs can lead to poorer efficacy of erlotinib and
sunitinibinadvancedand/ormetastaticnon–small-celllungcan-
cer and renal cell cancer, respectively.9,10 This interaction with
gastric acid suppressants may not be limited to TKIs given that
many oral drugs require a sufficiently acidic environment to
properlydissolveforsystemicabsorption.Therefore,thisanaly-
sis of TRIO-013/LOGiC was set out to determine if the orally ad-
ministered drugs capecitabine and/or lapatinib were ham-
pered by concomitant PPI administration.
Methods
Patients
Allpatientsincludedintheintention-to-treatassessmentofTRIO-
013/LOGiC were included in this ad hoc analysis. Patients’con-
comitantmedicationrecordswerereviewedtoidentifypatients
who were treated with PPIs. Coadministration of PPIs was de-
finedby20%ormoreoverlapbetweenPPIprescriptionandtrial
treatmentdurationasidentifiedpreviously.9Otherpertinentfac-
torsthatmayhavefactoredintooutcomeswerecollected,includ-
ing age, sex, histological subtype (intestinal vs diffuse), disease
stage (locally advanced vs metastatic), and race (Asian vs non-
Asian). The original TRIO-013/LOGiC trial is a clinical trial con-
ducted according to current ethical principles as set out by the
Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice; written in-
formed consent was obtained from participating patients prior
to any study procedures; and approval by local ethics review
boardsatindividualparticipatingsiteswasobtained,whichsub-
sequently allows for secondary analyses. Procedures followed
for this secondary analysis were in accordance with the ethical
standards as set forth by the 1964 Helsinki Declaration of the
World Medical Association.
Post Hoc Analysis
After dividing patients based on coadministration of PPIs and
arm of study, PFS and OS outcomes were compared by Kaplan-
Meier methods. Multivariate analysis by Cox proportional haz-
ards modeling took into consideration demographics (age, sex,
race), disease stage at diagnosis (locally advanced vs meta-
static), and histologic subtype. Differences in median sur-
vival were considered significant if P was less than .05.
Secondary Outcomes
Given that the hypothesis of this post hoc analysis is ultimately
rootedinadifferenceofdrugexposurebetweenpatientsreceiv-
ingPPIsvsnoPPIs,comparisonofsecondaryoutcomesbetween
these 2 groups included objective response rate (ORR), disease
controlrate(DCR),incidenceofgrade3or4diarrhea,incidence
ofanyrash,incidenceofhand-footsyndrome,numberofpatients
requiring capecitabine dose reductions (any cause), and num-
ber of patients requiring lapatinib dose reductions (any cause).
Statistical Considerations
Statistical analysis was performed with SAS version 9.3 (SAS
Institute Inc). All P values were calculated using 2-sided sta-
tistical testing and Cox proportional hazards ratios with
95% CIs.
Key Points
Question Do proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) impair the activity of
capecitabine in patients with metastatic gastroesophageal cancer
(GEC)?
Findings In this secondary analysis of TRIO-013, a phase III
randomized trial of capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CapeOx) with or
without lapatinib in patients with metastatic GEC receiving
CapeOx, PPIs significantly and negatively affected
progression-free survival (4.2 vs 5.7 months), overall survival (9.2
vs 11.3 months), and disease control rate (72% vs 83%).
Meaning Oncologists treating patients with capecitabine should
be aware of the potential negative interaction with gastric acid
suppressants such as PPIs and possibly histamine antagonists.

 Results
Patients
Of 545 patients in the intention-to-treat population on study,
229 (42%) patients received PPIs with 110 (40%) and 119 (43%)
inthelapatinibandcontrolarms,respectively.Allpatientsiden-
tified as having received any PPI therapy in fact received nearly
complete overlap between PPI prescription and study treat-
ment. Consequently, no further distinction is made regarding
PPI treatment duration.
As a cohort, 406 patients (74%) were male, predomi-
nantly with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) per-
formancestatus(PS)of1(n = 332[61%]),presentingwithmeta-
static disease (n = 521 [96%]) and/or poorly differentiated
disease (n = 212 [39%]). There was even distribution of those
patients with intestinal histologic subtype (n = 481 [88%]) be-
tween PPI-treated patients vs patients who were not treated
with PPIs. Of the prognostic factors collected, there was a sig-
nificantly higher proportion of Asians (n = 126 [55%]) and pa-
tients with an ECOG PS of 0 or 1 in the PPI-treated group. While
there was a higher proportion of women and locally ad-
vanced disease in the PPI group, these differences did not meet
statistical significance. Details of patient demographics and
characteristics can be found in Table 1.
PPIs vs No PPIs
Withinthecontrol(CapeOx + placebo)arm,patientsnottreated
with PPIs were found to have an improved median PFS (5.7 vs
4.2 months; hazard ratio [HR], 1.55; 95% CI, 1.29-1.81; P < .001
(Figure 1A) and median OS (11.3 vs 9.2 months; 95% CI, 1.06-
1.62; HR, 1.34; P = .04) (Figure 2A) compared with PPI-
treated patients.
In contrast, patients assigned to the lapatinib arm
(CapeOx + lapatinib) did not have a significant difference in
PFS (6.8 vs 5.7 months; HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.82-1.34; P = .54)
(Figure 1B) or median OS (13.8 vs 9.6 months; HR, 1.26;
95% CI, 0.97-1.55; P = .10) (Figure 2B) between patients
not treated with PPIs vs PPI-treated patients in univariate
analysis.
Effect of Other Prognostic Factors and Multivariate Analysis
Prognostic factors that have previously been reported to
affect patient outcomes were included in Cox proportional
hazards multivariate modeling. Specifically age (≥60 years),
male sex, diffuse subtype, metastatic disease at presenta-
tion, and non-Asian race/ethnicity were considered poor
prognostic factors.11 In patients treated with CapeOx alone,
effects of PPIs on both PFS and OS was still significant on
multivariate analysis (HR, 1.68; P < .001 and HR, 1.41;
P = .001, respectively) (Table 2). When the multivariate

 analysis was applied to patients treated on the lapatinib arm,
PPIs affected OS (HR, 1.38; P = .03) but not PFS (HR, 1.14;
P = .33).
Secondary Outcomes
Patients treated without PPIs had a slightly higher DCR (81.0%
vs 76.8%; P = .24) in which this difference was largely owing
to control arm patients where DCR was significantly im-
proved(82.5%vs71.2%;P = .02).OverallresponserateandDCR
in the experimental arm with lapatinib was not significant
(Table 3).
There was no statistically significant difference in the in-
cidence of capecitabine or lapatinib dose reductions, grade 3
or 4 diarrhea, or any rash between PPI-treated patients vs pa-
tients treated without PPIs. The largest difference in toxic ef-
fects was seen in the control arm where there was a numeri-
cal higher incidence of hand-foot syndrome in the population
treated without PPIs within both control and lapatinib arms,
though neither group met statistical significance (14.2% vs
10.2%; P = .32 and 20.8% vs 18.0%; P = .43, respectively).
Discussion
This secondary analysis of the TRIO-013/LOGiC trial demon-
strates an association between poorer outcomes with con-
comitant PPI use and capecitabine therapy in patients with
ERBB2/HER2-positive metastatic GEC. An improved PFS and

 OS favoring patients treated without PPIs suggests that a drug
interactionmayexist.Further,thesignificantdifferenceinDCR
between PPI-treated patients vs patients treated without PPIs
in the control arm suggests that the survival difference stems
from treatment efficacy, lending support to a drug exposure
explanation. Unfortunately, the original study did not collect
plasma drug levels from patients and therefore a direct phar-
macokinetic explanation cannot be drawn. These observa-
tions are in line with a previous retrospective study in which
patients with colorectal cancer receiving PPI treatment and ad-
juvant capecitabine also experienced poorer relapse-free sur-
vival compared with patients not receiving a PPI.12 Taken to-
gether,thisadhocanalysisgivesfurthersupportthatanegative
interaction exists between capecitabine and PPIs and war-
rants further investigation.
Whileanumericaldifferencewaspresentincludingatrend
toward an OS disadvantage, no significant detriment was seen
in lapatinib-treated patients who were exposed to PPIs. Draw-
ing conclusions from these patients is difficult given that they
received 2 oral therapeutics of which both may have been af-
fected by coadministration of gastric acid suppression therapy.
Further, though the primary outcomes of TRIO-013 were nega-
tive,preplannedsubgroupanalysesfoundyoungerpatientsand
Asian patients benefited from adding lapatinib to CapeOx.6
Consequently, in light of a PPI-related effect on outcomes in
the control arm, the lack of poorer outcomes in lapatinib-
treated patients suggests that PPIs impair capecitabine ab-
sorption. Whether or not there is a substantial interaction with
lapatinib cannot be answered from this analysis due to these
patients receiving 2 oral therapeutics.
Anegativeinteractionbetweencapecitabineandgastricacid
suppressantshasnotpreviouslybeenreportedexceptinasingle

s pharma-
cokinetic properties may explain what this analysis has ob-
served.Capecitabinereachesitspeakplasmaconcentrationap-
proximately 1.5 hours after ingestion suggesting that it likely
dissolves quickly and is absorbed predominantly in the upper
gastrointestinal tract.13 With its dissociation constant of 1.92, it
is sensitive to gastric pH level changes in which substantial re-
ductions in gastric acidity can lead to less drug dissolution and
subsequent less absorption into systemic circulation.14 Only 1
study has previously examined effects of coadministration of
an antacid, aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide
(Maalox; Novartis), and capecitabine.15 Twelve patients were

centration and overall time exposure (area under time–
concentration curve) between both groups. Whether Maalox
raises gastric pH sufficiently to impair capecitabine’
s ability to
dissolveisquestionable.16 Alternatively,mediangastricpHlev-
els rise above 5 in patients receiving PPIs.17 As a result, PPIs are
morelikelytohaveastrongerinteractionwithcapecitabinethan
Maalox. Lapatinib, on the other hand, does not appear to be as
sensitive to gastric acidity with its dissociation constant of 7.2,
which might partly explain why less of a detriment is seen in
PPI-treatedpatientsonthatarmofTRIO-013.18WhilemanyPPIs
undergo liver cytochrome P450 metabolization like ca-
pecitabine, specific enzymatic steps are thought to be separate
and unlikely to interact in this way.19
We have previously reported on negative interactions be-
tween gastric acid suppressants and oral TKIs. In a retrospec-
tivestudy10ofnearly200patientswithadvancedrenalcellcan-
cer treated with sunitinb, coadministration of both PPIs was
associated with poorer PFS and OS in sunitinib-treated pa-
tients. A similar finding was demonstrated in over 500 pa-
tients with advanced non–small-cell lung cancer treated with
erlotinib.9Furthermore,patientswithnon–small-celllungcan-
cer concomitantly receiving gastric acid suppression with er-
lotinib also had significantly less TKI-related toxic effects and
lowerORR.Theseassociationsmirrorsimilarfindingsofpoorer
outcomes and lower DCR in patients cotreated with PPIs and
capecitabine in the control arm of TRIO-013. For both stud-
ies, PPI effects were weighed against other known prognostic
indices in multivariate analyses and were found not to be con-
tributing significantly to PPI-treated patient outcomes. In fact,
patients treated without PPIs in TRIO-013 had a significantly
higher proportion of patients carrying better prognostic fac-
tors such as Asian descent and female sex (Table 1).
Drug interactions are challenging to manage, particularly
in light of a population of patients with GEC in which many
will receive gastric acid suppressants for symptom manage-
ment, leading to a higher prevalence of PPI therapy. Coupled
with increasing rates of obesity and gastroesophageal reflux
disease (GERD), further evidence of interactions between PPIs
andotheroral,antineoplastictherapeuticsislikelytosurface.20
Sequential administration of capecitabine and PPIs is un-
likely to overcome their interaction. Proton pump inhibitors
have short half-lives, but this is likely owing to their ability to
quickly,covalently,andirreversiblybindtogastricparietalcells’
proton pumps.21 Consequently, the duration of effect on over-
allgastricpHlevelsislonglasting.Giventhatdataexiststodem-
onstrate a lack of interaction between Maalox and ca-
pecitabine, perhaps similar GERD treatments may serve as an
alternative. Theoretically, H2RAs do not raise gastric pH lev-
els to levels seen with PPIs and may have less interaction with
oral therapeutics, but data are lacking in this regard.17 More
recently, erlotinib absorption in patients receiving PPIs was
shown to be improved when administering the drug with an
acidic beverage, such as cola.22 Whether this reversal can be
also done for capecitabine remains to be investigated.
Limitations
As stated previously, the largest limitation of this analysis is
the lack of pharmacokinetic data to fully corroborate an ex-
planation of lower drug exposure and differences in out-
comes between PPI-treated patients vs patients treated with-
out PPIs. It should also be noted that inaccuracies regarding
concomitant medication may occur; and further, over-the-
countergastricacidsuppressantsmayalsonotbecaptureddur-
ing the study’
s implementation. However, this ad hoc analy-
sis of prospective trial evidence builds upon previous
retrospective work. Future directions include proper pharma-
cokinetic studies and assessment of other oral, antineoplas-
tic therapeutics.
Conclusions
This secondary analysis of TRIO-013/LOGiC confirms previ-
ousretrospectivedatathatconcomitantuseofgastricacidsup-
pressants such as PPIs with capecitabine may lower the anti-
tumor efficacy of capecitabine. This negative association is
strongestwhentakingintoconsiderationreducedDCRcoupled
with lower PFS and OS in CapeOx-treated patients. However,
this trial did not examine for pharmacokinetics and circulat-
ing drug levels so a direct link with potential reduced ca-
pecitabine absorption cannot be made in this analysis.
What becomes more concerning is the increasing ten-
dency toward development of oral chemotherapeutics. Other
oral drugs such as erlotinib and sunitinib may suffer from the
same drug interaction phenomenon.9,10 While stopping gas-
tric acid suppressants may prove difficult, it may be possible
to temporarily counteract a lowered absorption by using an
acidic beverage for drug administration.22 Overall, more food-
effect studies are warranted in the development of oral thera-
peutics, and our study draws light to the possibility that such
an interaction may also affect more commonly used cyto-
toxic chemotherapeutics, such as capecitabine, used across
tumor subtypes.
