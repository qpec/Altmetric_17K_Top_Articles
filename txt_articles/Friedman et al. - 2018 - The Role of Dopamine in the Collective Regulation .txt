SUMMARY
Colonies of the red harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex barbatus) differ in how they regulate collective
foraging activity in response to changes in humidity. We used transcriptomic, physiological, and phar-
macological experiments to investigate the molecular basis of this ecologically important variation in
collective behavior among colonies. RNA sequencing of forager brain tissue showed an association be-
tween colony foraging activity and differential expression of transcripts related to biogenic amine and
neurohormonal metabolism and signaling. In field experiments, pharmacological increases in forager
brain dopamine titer caused significant increases in foraging activity. Colonies that were naturally
most sensitive to humidity were significantly more responsive to the stimulatory effect of exogenous
dopamine. In addition, forager brain tissue significantly varied among colonies in biogenic amine
content. Neurophysiological variation among colonies associated with individual forager sensitivity
to humidity may reflect the heritable molecular variation on which natural selection acts to shape
the collective regulation of foraging.
INTRODUCTION
Many biological systems, from brains to insect colonies, are regulated by distributed processes based on
local interactions. Variation among groups in collective behavior (Pruitt et al., 2017) can arise from differ-
ences between groups in individual response to local interactions or from differences in group composition
(Bengston and Jandt, 2014; Jandt et al., 2014). In social insects, such as ants and honeybees, collective
behavior is regulated through olfactory interactions among workers (Dornhaus and Franks, 2008; Feiner-
man and Korman, 2017; Gordon, 1996, 2010; Gordon and Mehdiabadi, 1999). Ants are a globally distrib-
uted clade of social insect species (Gibb et al., 2017; Parr et al., 2017; Ward, 2014), and ecological factors
shape the evolution of ant collective behavior (Gordon, 2013, 2014; Lanan, 2014). Rapid advances in high-
throughput sequencing technologies are providing insight into the genomic, transcriptomic, and epige-
nomic differences among social insect species (Boomsma et al., 2017; Favreau et al., 2018; Toth and Rehan,
2017). Molecular studies have characterized various mechanistic aspects of division of labor among workers
within social insect colonies (Friedman and Gordon, 2016; Kamhi and Traniello, 2013; Linksvayer, 2015;
Simola et al., 2016), building on a long history of diverse research into social insect behavior (Detrain
and Deneubourg, 2006; Gordon, 1992; Ho
¨ lldobler and Wilson, 2009; Seeley, 2010; von Frisch, 1974).
However, much less is known about the molecular variation among social insect colonies associated with
heritable variation in collective behavior (Bengston and Jandt, 2014; Jandt et al., 2014; Jandt and Gordon,
2016).
Across ant and bee species, variation among nestmates in reproductive status and behavioral perfor-
mance are associated with tissue-specific physiological and transcriptomic differences (Chandra et al.,
2018; Gordon, 2016a; Jeanne, 2016; Johnson and Linksvayer, 2010; Toth and Dolezal, 2017). Worker brain
biogenic amine and neurohormonal signaling pathways are especially important in regulating the
foraging activity of social (Friedman and Gordon, 2016; Gospocic et al., 2017; Kamhi and Traniello,
2013; Yan et al., 2014) and solitary insects (Kamhi et al., 2017; Perry and Barron, 2013; Waddell, 2013).
Changes in brain biogenic amine content influence individual worker behavior by altering their sensitivity
to certain stimuli such as foraging cues (Bubak et al., 2016; Kamhi and Traniello, 2013; Muscedere et al.,
2012; Scheiner et al., 2017). Natural variation among nestmates in sensitivity to stimuli can be adaptive
for colony function, for example, by allowing for dynamic task allocation (Gordon, 1989; Gordon and
Mehdiabadi, 1999). Dopamine appears to be central to the regulation of individual foraging activity in
social insects (Friedman and Gordon, 2016; Kamhi and Traniello, 2013) and other animals (Barron

 et al., 2010; Calhoun et al., 2015; Clark and Dagher, 2014; Friston et al., 2012; Perry and Barron, 2013;
Waddell, 2013). In honeybees, brain dopamine titers are higher in foragers than in non-foragers (Tedja-
kumala et al., 2017; Wagener-Hulme et al., 1999), and pharmacological increases in brain dopaminergic
signaling increase foraging activity (Mustard et al., 2012; Perry et al., 2016; Scheiner et al., 2017; Søvik
et al., 2014, 2015b). In many ant species, foragers have higher brain dopamine titer than workers of other
task group (Kamhi et al., 2017; Seid and Traniello, 2005; Smith et al., 2013), although in some species this
pattern appears to be reversed (Penick et al., 2014). Laboratory pharmacological studies in carpenter
ants confirm a role for dopaminergic signaling in the regulation of individual foraging activity (Entler
et al., 2016). In ants, dopamine is also involved in trophallaxis (Wada-Katsumata et al., 2011) and repro-
duction (Okada et al., 2015; Penick et al., 2014). Recent pharmacological experiments in the field have
been used to examine ant behavior (Male
´ et al., 2017), but not the biogenic amine neurophysiology
of foraging.
Colonies of the red harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, forage in the desert for seeds that provide
both food and water. Foragers lose water while out in the desert sun, and the rate of water loss is higher
in dry conditions (Lighton and Bartholomew, 1988; Lighton and Feener, 1989). To manage the tradeoff
between food accumulation and water loss, colonies adjust foraging activity to changes in ambient
conditions, especially humidity (Gordon, 2013; Gordon et al., 2013; Prabhakar et al., 2012). Colony
foraging activity is regulated in a distributed fashion by brief olfactory interactions when one ant assesses
the cuticular hydrocarbons of the other (Greene et al., 2013; Greene and Gordon, 2003): an outgoing
forager is stimulated to leave the nest by its rate of interaction with incoming foragers with food
(Davidson et al., 2016; Greene et al., 2013; Pinter-Wollman et al., 2013; Pless et al., 2015). Since a forager
continues to search until it finds a seed, the rate of forager return is related to food availability (Gordon,
1991). Colonies of P. barbatus significantly vary in how strongly they reduce foraging activity in dry
conditions (Gordon, 1991, 2013; Gordon et al., 2011, 2013), meaning that colonies differ in their sensi-
tivity to humidity. These behavioral differences among colonies of P. barbatus persist year after year
despite total worker turnover (Gordon, 1991, 2013; Gordon et al., 2011; Gordon and Ho
¨ lldobler, 1987),
and daughter colonies resemble their mothers in the thresholds for dry conditions that lead them to
reduce foraging (Gordon, 2013). This variation among colonies of P. barbatus in foraging behavior is
ecologically important and associated with differences in colony lifetime reproductive success (Gordon,
2013; Ingram et al., 2013). Colony differences in collective behavior could be due to stable colony differ-
ences in how foragers adjust their sensitivity to interactions in dry conditions (Davidson et al., 2016; Pa-
gliara et al., 2018).
Here we examine the neurophysiological basis of variation among red harvester ant colonies in how they
regulate their collective foraging behavior. Because differences among P. barbatus colonies in sensitivity to
humidity persist year after year, it appears that successive cohorts of nestmate foragers inherit genetic or
epigenetic factors, which bias their foraging activity in dry conditions. Molecular variation among foragers
from different colonies may lead to differences in individual forager decisions about whether to forage in
dry conditions. This would produce the observed variation among colonies in the collective regulation in
foraging. The specific molecular mechanisms that might underlie forager sensitivity to humidity are not
known.
To investigate this, we first used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to assess transcriptomic differences in forager
brain tissue between 2 sets of colonies that naturally varied in how strongly they reduced foraging activity in
dry conditions. Patterns of transcript differential- and co-expression between the 2 sets of colonies
included significant changes in biogenic amine and neurohormonal pathways. To test the role of dopamine
signaling in the regulation of individual foraging activity, we manipulated the brain dopamine titer of for-
agers in field experiments during 2 consecutive years. Foragers with increased brain dopamine titer made
significantly more foraging trips than control-treated nestmates, and foragers treated with a metabolic in-
hibitor of dopamine synthesis significantly decreased foraging activity relative to control-treated nest-
mates. In the set of 9 colonies used in pharmacological experiments, we also characterized natural patterns
of behavioral variation and forager brain biogenic amine content. Colonies that were naturally more sen-
sitive to humidity tended to be more responsive to the stimulatory effect of exogenous dopamine. This
suggests that a forager’s decision whether to leave the nest on its next trip may be influenced by dopamine,
so that variation among colonies in the regulation of foraging in response to conditions may be due to
differences among colonies in forager biogenic amine neurophysiology.

 RESULTS
Forager Brain Transcriptomic Differences Are Associated with Differences in Colony
Behavior
Forager brain transcriptomes differed between 2 sets of P. barbatus colonies that differed in how strongly
they reduced foraging activity in dry conditions (see Transparent Methods 1A). We collected active for-
agers on the same morning from 6 colonies, of which 3 strongly reduced foraging in dry conditions and
3 did not. For each colony, 3 replicate RNA-seq libraries were sequenced from the mRNA extracted
from 3 pooled dissected forager brains. We used the kallisto/sleuth RNA-seq analysis pipeline (Bray
et al., 2016) to quantify transcript expression against the P. barbatus reference transcriptome (Smith
et al., 2011). Of the 20,387 transcripts in the reference transcriptome 273 were significantly differentially ex-
pressed in whole forager brains between the 2 sets of colonies (Figure 1A). A total of 113 transcripts were
upregulated in colonies that do not reduce foraging on dry days, and 160 transcripts were upregulated in
colonies that strongly reduce foraging on dry days. Across the whole transcriptome, the per-transcript
mean expression levels were correlated between the 2 sets of colonies (Pearson r2 = 0.99). A linear principal
component analysis in sleuth (Pimentel et al., 2016) showed that colony transcriptomes did not cluster
clearly by behavioral type.
Overall, the list of 273 transcripts significantly differentially expressed in either direction was enriched in
the terms ‘‘hormone activity,’’ ‘‘oxidoreductase activity,’’ and ‘‘copper ion binding’’ (p value < 0.0005,
Fisher’s exact test, false discovery rate [FDR] <0.25). The 160 transcripts upregulated in colonies that
did not reduce foraging in dry conditions did not show any GO term enrichment with FDR < 0.9. The
113 transcripts upregulated in the colonies that strongly reduced foraging in dry conditions were en-
riched in GO terms ‘‘neuropeptide signaling pathway,’’ ‘‘catecholamine metabolic process,’’ and ‘‘recep-
tor binding’’ (all with p value < 0.005 and FDR < 0.3). The enrichment in biogenic amine signaling and
metabolism GO terms was reflected in the higher expression of the neurometabolic enzymes phenylal-
anine hydroxylase (3.17-fold change, XM_011648879.1, q-value = 0.0049) and tyramine b-hydroxylase

 ‘‘neuropeptide signaling pathway’’ was driven by increased expression of transcripts from pathways
involved in the regulation of insect foraging behavior, including the FMRFamide receptor (1.69-fold
change, XM_011639920.1, q-value = 0.0036), an allatostatin peptide hormone (1.2-fold change,
XM_011640492.1, q-value = 1.77 3 10�5), and the hypertrehalosaemic prohormone (1.82-fold change,
XM_011643332.1, q-value 1.60 3 10�7), all of which are important in insect neurohormonal signaling in
solitary insects (Caers et al., 2012; Orchard and Lange, 2013; Verlinden et al., 2015). In addition, foragers
from colonies that strongly reduced foraging on dry days had significantly higher expression of an inositol
monophosphatase (3.1-fold change, XM_011632239.1, q-value = 5.38 3 10�5), a phosphoinositide phos-
pholipase (1.33-fold change, XM_011632265.1, q-value = 0.0021), and the glycogen synthase kinase 3b
interaction protein (1.54- fold change, XM_011646061.1, q-value = 0.0002). These 3 protein products
are involved in the inositol phosphate signaling pathway (Berridge, 2009), implicated in the transcrip-
tomic changes between nurse and forager honeybees (Lutz et al., 2012; Whitfield et al., 2003).
To further examine the functional relationships among brain-expressed transcripts in P. barbatus foragers,
we performed a transcriptome-wide co-expression analysis (Mikheyev and Linksvayer, 2015; Morandin
et al., 2016), using Cytoscape (see Transparent Methods 1A) (Su et al., 2014). The final transcript co-expres-
sion network consisted of 1,933 correlated transcripts across 167 isolated subnetworks. Only 2 of the 167
subnetworks had more than 50 transcripts (920 and 600 transcripts, respectively, hereafter referred to as
‘‘Module 1’’ and ‘‘Module 2,’’ Figure 1B). The 3 next-largest subnetworks had between 10 and 50 transcripts,
and the remaining 162 connected subnetworks all had fewer than 6 connected transcripts. The 2 large con-
nected transcript co-expression modules described above were biased in their mean expression values
between the 2 groups of colonies. Of the 920 transcripts in Module 1, 656 (71%) had higher, but not neces-
sarily significantly different mean expression levels in colonies that strongly reduced foraging activity in dry
conditions. Of the 600 transcripts in Module 2, 545 (91%) had higher mean expression values in colonies
that did not strongly reduce foraging activity in dry conditions. In addition, the modules were functionally
enriched in several GO categories of neurophysiological relevance. Module 1 was enriched in GO terms
‘‘G-protein-coupled amine receptor activity,’’ ‘‘regulation of neurotransmitter levels,’’ and ‘‘postsynaptic
signal transduction’’ (all p values < 0.001, FDR <0.05). Module 1 was strongly depleted in transcripts relating
to ‘‘odorant binding’’ and ‘‘olfactory receptor activity.’’ Module 1 was significantly depleted in the GO term
‘‘cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process,’’ whereas this exact term was significantly enriched in
Module 2. In addition, Module 2 was enriched in GO term ‘‘cellular response to stress,’’ and multiple
GO terms relating to metabolism (all p values < 0.001, FDR < 0.05).
Manipulation of Forager Brain Dopamine Titer Alters Foraging Activity
Based on the aforementioned transcriptomic results, we hypothesized that differences among colonies in
forager brain neurophysiology could lead to colony differences in behavior. To test this hypothesis, we
observed the behavior of foragers with altered brain dopamine titers in the field.
First, we used mass spectrometry to determine that oral administration of dopamine to P. barbatus workers
significantly raises single brain dopamine titers in a dose- and time-dependent fashion (see Transparent
Methods 1B–1D). We measured single forager brain dopamine titer at 2 time points (18 and 66 hr after
treatment), using two concentrations of oral dopamine solution (3 mg/mL and 30 mg/mL), with 6–9 ant
brains measured per biological group. At the 18-hr time point used for later behavioral experiments, brain
dopamine levels in single P. barbatus workers in the lower-dose (3 mg/mL dopamine) treatment group
were significantly increased by 2.67-fold relative to controls (Figure 2) (t = 2.61, df = 15, p = 0.0199). In
the higher-dose (30 mg/mL dopamine) treatment group, brain dopamine titers were increased by 19.91-
fold relative to controls (t = 4.82, df = 15, p < 0.0002). Brain dopamine titers were still significantly increased
in both treatment groups relative to controls on the third day after treatment (both p < 0.005).
Next, we tested the hypothesis that increasing forager brain dopamine titer would increase foraging
activity in the field (see Transparent Methods 1E). Foragers treated with 3 mg/mL dopamine made signif-
icantly more foraging trips compared with their control-treated nestmates in field experiments over
2 years (Figure 3, Data S1). In 2016, dopamine-treated foragers made on average 20.5% more foraging
trips than control-treated nestmates (N = 9 colonies, effect s 0, p < 0.001, t = 5.60). In the same 9 col-
onies in 2017, dopamine-treated foragers made on average 10.3% more foraging trips than control-
treated nestmates (effect s 0, p < 0.001, t = 6.09). A colony’s response to dopamine in 2016 was not
significantly correlated with its response to dopamine in 2017 (Kendall rank correlation p > 0.5).
286
iScience 8, 283–294, October 26, 2018
 To test the hypothesis that decreasing forager brain dopamine would lead to a decrease in foraging activ-
ity, we tested the effect of 3-iodotyrosine (3IY) on foraging activity. 3IY is a metabolic inhibitor that reduces
brain dopamine titer in insects (Neckameyer, 1996) however, we did not use mass spectrometry to quantify
brain dopamine titer change due to 3IY. In the same colonies used in the aforementioned dopamine ex-
periments, foragers treated with 3 mg/mL 3IY made significantly fewer foraging trips than control-treated
nestmates (Figure 3, Data S1). In 2017, 3IY-treated foragers made on average 19.1% fewer foraging trips
than control-treated nestmates (effect s 0, p < 0.001, t = 13.60).
Colonies Naturally More Sensitive to Humidity Are More Responsive to Dopamine
Next we asked how variation in colony response to pharmacological manipulation was associated with
natural variation in how strongly colonies reduced foraging activity in dry conditions. Colony reduction
of foraging activity in response to humidity was quantified by estimating the decrease in daily foraging
trips made by the colony per percent decrease in humidity (see Transparent Methods 1F). As in previous
studies, the 9 colonies strongly differed in how much they reduced foraging activity in dry conditions.
The estimated reduction in foraging trips made per colony per 1% reduction in humidity ranged from
27 to 266.
Colonies that more strongly reduced foraging activity in dry conditions were more responsive to the stim-
ulatory effect of exogenous dopamine (Figure 4) (N = 9 colonies, Kendall’s rank correlation test, t = 0.44,
p = 0.013, Pearson’s correlation r2 = 0.52, p = 0.028). There was no significant relation between a colony’s
response to 3IY and how strongly it reduced foraging activity in dry conditions (Pearson’s correlation test
p > 0.7).
Colonies Significantly Vary in Forager Brain Biogenic Amine Content
Brain dopamine and serotonin titers were quantified from active foragers from the 9 colonies used in the
aforementioned pharmacological experiments (see Transparent Methods 1G). Colonies significantly varied
in their average forager brain dopamine to serotonin ratio (Figure 5) (N = 9 colonies, N = 5 samples/colony
of 2 pooled brains, ANOVA for effect of colony, p < 0.001). There was no significant relationship between
the colony’s average forager brain dopamine to serotonin ratio and how strongly the colony reduced
foraging activity in dry conditions earlier in the season (Spearman’s R = �0.13, p = 0.74). Colonies with
higher dopamine to serotonin ratios tended to be less responsive toward the stimulatory effects of dopa-
mine, but this trend was not significant (Spearman’s R = �0.48, p = 0.19).
DISCUSSION
We used transcriptomic, pharmacological, and physiological experiments to assess the molecular basis of
variation among colonies of P. barbatus in foraging behavior.

Titers in a Dose- and Time-Dependent Fashion

solution. No. of single brains measured per group is 6–9. Dopamine titer was measured by mass spectrometry with a
labeled internal dopamine standard (see Transparent Methods 1B–1D).

 Colonies that differed in the regulation of foraging activity significantly differed in forager brain gene
expression (Figure 1A). These transcriptomic changes were enriched in biogenic amine and neurohor-
mone-related signaling transcripts. In addition, colonies that differed in how they regulate foraging in
dry conditions appeared to differ in the use of two large modules of co-expressed transcripts related to
neural signaling and metabolism (Figure 1B). This suggests that differences among colonies in foraging
activity may be due to differences in how foragers evaluate foraging-related stimuli, reflected in transcrip-
tomic changes in their neural signaling pathways (e.g., as in Lucas and Sokolowski [2009]). To our knowl-
edge, this is the first reported measurement of brain transcriptome from foraging ants in their natural
context. Several of the same pathways differentially expressed between foraging and non-foraging nest-
mates in other social insects, such as neuropeptides and inositol phosphate metabolism (Friedman and
Gordon, 2016; Kamhi and Traniello, 2013; Yan et al., 2014), were differentially expressed in the brain tissue
of foragers from colonies that vary in foraging activity. These pathways are deeply conserved and often
involved in regulating foraging and feeding behavior across insect species (Barron et al., 2010; Gospocic
et al., 2017). Here we extend these results to suggest that the neuromolecular mechanisms involved in
behavioral variation among solitary insects and social insect nestmates may also play a role in generating
collective behavioral differences among colonies (Jandt et al., 2014).
Within a colony, variation among social insect workers in foraging activity has been linked to changes in the
neuromodulatory biogenic amines dopamine, tyramine, and octopamine (Kamhi et al., 2017; Scheiner
et al., 2006, 2017), apparently by altering the sensitivity to foraging-related cues (Kamhi and Traniello,
2013). Our transcriptomic results from forager brains, showing differential expression of the biogenic amine
metabolic genes phenylalanine hydroxylase and tyramine b-hydroxylase, were consistent with alterations in
either dopamine or octopamine metabolism. In studies of behavioral variation among nestmates, dopa-
mine has consistently been associated with foraging activity in ants (Kamhi and Traniello [2013], although
see Penick et al. [2014]). In addition, the role of dopamine in regulating the foraging activity of ant and bee
workers has been confirmed with pharmacological experiments (Entler et al., 2016; Perry and Barron, 2013;
Søvik et al., 2014), but such experiments have not yet been done to investigate the role of octopamine or
tyramine in the regulation of ant foraging. Here, we tested only the role of dopamine, and further work is
needed to examine the role of other biogenic amines in the regulation of foraging in harvester ants.
We found differential expression of key biogenic amine metabolic loci in forager brain tissue from colonies
that differed in their sensitivity to humidity. In addition, biogenic amine metabolism-related transcripts
were significantly enriched in the list of transcripts upregulated in colonies sensitive to humidity. This sug-
gests that colony differences in sensitivity to humidity may be related to differences in forager brain
biogenic amine metabolism, although transcriptomic differences alone are not sufficient to demonstrate
physiological impact. Biogenic amine metabolic loci have a well-known role in insect cuticle sclerotization
and tanning (Kramer et al., 2001; Rebeiz and Williams, 2017) and may influence desiccation tolerance or

 coloration in P. barbatus. However, our RNA-seq data were generated from dissected brain tissue without
residual head cuticle, so we cannot determine whether forager cuticle expression of biogenic amine meta-
bolic loci is associated with variation among colonies in foraging behavior. Whole-brain biogenic amine
titers vary consistently between foraging and non-foraging workers in ant and bee colonies (Kamhi and
Traniello, 2013), but previous transcriptomic studies have not identified differential expression of biogenic
amine metabolic genes between nestmates (Feldmeyer et al., 2014; Manfredini et al., 2014; Mikheyev and
Linksvayer, 2015). This may be because brain-specific transcriptomic changes important for biogenic amine
metabolism are obscured when whole-body or whole-head gene expression profiles are measured (John-
son et al., 2013). Alternatively, associations between worker task and brain biogenic amine content may be
driven by mechanisms other than the brain-specific differential expression of metabolic loci, for example,
by changes in metabolite transport from the hemolymph.
Pharmacological increases of forager brain dopamine significantly increased foraging activity in foragers
relative to their nestmates the following day (Figure 3). Conversely, ostensible reductions of forager brain
dopamine significantly reduced foraging activity the following day (Figure 3). To our knowledge this is the
first behavioral pharmacological manipulation of biogenic amine neurophysiology in ants in the field.
These experiments link dopamine signaling and foraging activity in ants, showing a positive association
that is consistent with the results of previous pharmacological studies on the role of dopamine signaling
in the regulation of insect foraging (Perry and Barron, 2013; Søvik et al., 2015a).
There are several non-exclusive behavioral mechanisms that may explain how changes in dopamine
signaling influence an individual forager’s decision to leave the nest on its next trip. First, changes in
dopamine signaling could change how a forager perceives interactions with nestmates. Previous work
has suggested that increases in brain dopamine titer increase an ant’s sensitivity to foraging cues such
as pheromone trails (Kamhi and Traniello, 2013). Foragers of P. barbatus are not stimulated to leave the
nest by pheromone trails (Prabhakar et al., 2012). Instead, olfactory interactions between outgoing and re-
turning foragers with food stimulate outgoing foragers to leave the nest (Davidson et al., 2016; Pinter-Woll-
man et al., 2013). We suggest that increases in dopamine signaling may increase forager sensitivity to these
olfactory interactions, whereas decreases in dopamine signaling may decrease forager sensitivity to inter-
actions. In this way, increased dopamine signaling might override the negative influence of low humidity.
Second, changes in dopamine signaling could alter the forager’s perception of its own physiological state
or the harshness of the environment, including low humidity. Self-evaluation of physiological state is impor-
tant in the regulation of individual foraging activity in other ant species (Robinson et al., 2012; Silberman
et al., 2016), and dopamine can influence the evaluation of environmental stimuli and organismal state (Bar-
ron et al., 2015; Friston et al., 2012; Scaplen and Kaun, 2016). Thus, increases in dopamine signaling may
lead dopamine-treated P. barbatus foragers to overestimate their physiological readiness for foraging
given the perceived humidity, and vice-versa for 3IY-treated foragers. Third, dopamine signaling influences
the light-dependent circadian rhythm of insects (Hirsh et al., 2010; Nall and Sehgal, 2014), and changes in
dopaminergic signaling could interact with circadian patterns of gene expression in the brain of P. barbatus

 foragers (Ingram et al., 2005, 2016) and stimulate foraging despite low humidity. Finally, our pharmacolog-
ical treatments may alter foraging activity by changing the brain titer of some neurotransmitter other than
dopamine. By the time of the behavioral observation, some of the ingested dopamine may have been
metabolized into related compounds such as tyramine or octopamine. Both tyramine and octopamine
regulate some aspects of foraging in bees (Kamhi et al., 2017; Scheiner et al., 2006, 2017), although less
is known about their role in ant foraging. Similarly, 3IY may modulate the brain titers of biogenic amines
other than dopamine, or act directly on aminergic receptors.
Colonies that more strongly reduced foraging activity in dry conditions were more sensitive to the stimu-
latory effects of dopamine on foraging activity (Figure 4). This significant correlation suggests that exoge-
nous dopamine may improve forager perception of daily conditions, generating a more positive response
to the cues that stimulate foraging in the colonies that reduce foraging activity most when conditions are
poor. Alternatively, elevated forager brain dopamine titers may simply override the forager’s ability to
detect that environmental conditions are poor, eliciting a higher stimulatory response in colonies most
sensitive to changes in ambient humidity. Variation among colonies could arise from shared genetic or
epigenetic factors that influence dopaminergic neurophysiology. Colonies of P. barbatus may show stable
differences in how they regulate foraging activity in dry conditions (Gordon, 2013) due to persistent factors
that modulate the influence of humidity on forager behavior.
Colonies significantly differed in average forager brain dopamine to serotonin ratio (Figure 5). To our
knowledge, this is the first measurement of brain biogenic amine titers in an ant species outside of the lab-
oratory. Differences among colonies in forager brain biogenic content were not correlated with variation
among colonies in sensitivity to humidity or response to pharmacology. Thus variation among colonies
of P. barbatus in foraging activity may be due to changes in neurophysiology at a finer scale than the whole
brain. For example, biogenic amine metabolic differences between foraging and non-foraging honeybees
occur within specific subregions (Schulz et al., 2003). The expression of dopamine receptors or dopamine-
activated neural signaling pathways may also influence behaviorally important dopaminergic neurophysi-
ology (Landayan et al., 2018; Yamamoto and Seto, 2014). Such non-metabolic effects in biogenic amine
signaling pathways would not lead to observable differences among colonies in their average level of
forager whole-brain dopamine to serotonin ratio. Our transcriptomic results from forager brains showed
that differences between colonies in foraging behavior are associated with the expression of genes related
to neural signaling aspects of biogenic aminergic neurophysiology. Forager brain octopamine or tyramine
titers may also be important in foraging activity (Kamhi et al., 2017; Perry and Barron, 2013; Scheiner et al.,
2017) and were not measured here. Further analyses of forager neurophysiology are needed to explore
how differences among colonies in brain biogenic amine signaling and metabolism are associated with dif-
ferences among colonies in behavior.
Here we link variation among colonies in sensitivity to humidity with variation among colonies in forager
dopaminergic neurophysiology. Transcriptomic results suggested that natural variation among colonies

 in forager neurophysiology may be the source of differences among colonies in sensitivity to humidity, impli-
cating biogenic amine and neurohormonal signaling. Pharmacological experiments found that foragers
from colonies who reduced foraging most in dry conditions were most stimulated by exogenous dopamine.
This further supports a role for dopamine signaling in the variation among colonies in sensitivity to humidity.
Our study leaves open several questions to be pursued in future research. First, our transcriptomic results
implicate a variety of molecular pathways that are associated with behavioral differences among colonies.
The transcriptomic differences were enriched in loci related to biogenic amine metabolism and signaling.
This result is consistent with a role not only for dopamine in behavioral differences among colonies but also
for other neuromodulators such as tyramine or octopamine. Although our pharmacological treatments
demonstrated a clear influence on foraging behavior of altered brain dopamine titers, it would be inter-
esting to measure the influence of drug treatments on the metabolism of biogenic amines other than dopa-
mine, or on other neurotransmitter receptors. Second, our results do not specify whether the increase in
foraging activity due to dopamine treatment is because a few foragers dramatically increase foraging ac-
tivity, or whether most increase activity slightly. We are currently investigating this in experiments with indi-
vidually marked ants. Finally, there is much to learn about how dopamine affects a forager’s decision to
leave the nest on its next foraging trip and how this is related to the stimulation of foraging by the rate
of olfactory encounters with returning foragers (Davidson et al., 2016; Pinter-Wollman et al., 2013).
Molecular studies in social insects have primarily examined differences between workers performing
different tasks within the same colony (Johnson and Linksvayer, 2010; Kamhi and Traniello, 2013; Linksvayer,
2015; Robinson, 2003). However, it is the variation among colonies in task performance that leads to variation
in reproductive success and thus the evolution of collective behavior (Gordon, 2011, 2013; 2016b). To under-
stand the evolution of colony behavior, we need to learn how patterns of molecular variation among col-
onies are shaped by the interaction of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors (Abouheif et al.,
2014; Rehan and Toth, 2015; Toth and Rehan, 2017; Toth and Robinson, 2007; West-Eberhard, 2003).

1. Transparent Methods 
A. Transcriptomic Methods 
Foragers of ​Pogonomyrmex barbatus ​were collected into liquid nitrogen between 
06:00-08:00 on 8/20/2014, from colonies at a long-term field site near Rodeo NM, at 
which all colonies have been identified and censused since 1985 ​(Ingram et al., 2013)​. 
Foragers were collected as soon as they left the nest entrance, not carrying anything, 
and moved off the nest mound onto a foraging trail or fan. Foragers were collected from 
6 mature colonies in which foraging behavior had been monitored in previous work. 
Three of the colonies strongly reduced foraging on dry days relative to humid days, in 
counts of foraging activity made in in 2011 and 2012 ​(Gordon, 2013)​, while the other 3 
colonies did not strongly reduce foraging activity on dry days. There were similar 
differences between some of the colonies in each group in foraging activity measured in 
2009 ​(Gordon et al., 2011)​. Other work shows that colonies are consistent from year to 
year in foraging activity ​(Gordon, 1991; Gordon et al., 2013)​. ​No ethical precautions 
were required for this study. 
Samples were shipped from the field site to the laboratory in liquid nitrogen 
(Cryoship), and stored at -80C. Whole brains were cleanly dissected away from 
muscular, glandular, and connective tissue in cold RNAlater buffer. Dissected brains 
were frozen in Triazol at -80C until RNA extraction.​ ​Total RNA was extracted from 
dissected brains using a Direct-zol RNA extraction kit (Zymo Research). RNA 
concentration was assessed using Qubit 2.0 RNA HS reagents (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) and purity using a NanoDrop (ND 2000, Thermo Scientific). Total RNA was 
assessed for quality using a BioAnalyzer tapestation (Agilent Technologies), and 
samples with RNA Integrity Number (RIN) > 8.0 were used to make RNA libraries. 3 
libraries were made for each of 6 colonies. Each library consisted of poly-AAA+ mRNA 
extracted from the pooled dissected brains of 3 foragers. Libraries were generated 
using Illumina’s TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit. Reads are available in the 
Short Read Archive (BioProject: PRJNA277638). 
 For the kallisto/sleuth differential gene expression analysis pipeline, the 
reference transcriptome was indexed by kallisto v.0.42.5 ​(Bray et al., 2016)​. RNA-seq 
reads were pseudoaligned to the indexed reference transcriptome with kallisto, a 
method with good consistency to other RNA-seq and rt-qPCR quantifications of 
differential expression ​(Costa-Silva et al., 2017)​. The k-mer bias correction option was 
implemented and 100 bootstrapped transcriptomes were generated for each library to 
estimate the variation of expression for each transcript. The kallisto output was 
analyzed using the sleuth v0.28.0 package ​(Pimentel et al., 2016)​ in R v.3.3.0 ​(R 
Development Core Team, 2014)​. Across the 18 libraries from 6 colonies, there were a 
total of ~355 million 75 basepair paired-end RNA-seq reads. All workers sampled in this 
study are part of the same interbreeding J1/J2 population of ​P. barbatus ​at a long-term 
study site ​(Ingram et al., 2013)​ and no colonies or libraries displayed a mapping bias to 
the reference transcriptome used. A post-correction q-value threshold of 0.01 was used 
to call a transcript as differentially-expressed.To generate a transcript co-expression 
network, the “ExpressionCorrelation” plugin was used within Cytoscape ​(Su et al., 2014) 
with a cutoff of transcript-transcript Pearson correlation r​2​ > 0.93 across all 18 libraries. 
To generate functional annotations of the reference transcriptome, InterProScan 
(Jones et al., 2014)​ was used to query each transcript’s predicted protein translation 
against 11 protein databases (Profile HMM models: CATH-Gene3D, Superfamily, 
PIRSF, TIGRFAMs, Panther, Pfam, and Smart. Profile models: HAMAP, Prosite, 
ProDom. Pattern models: PRINTS, Prosite). InterProScan protein domain-level GO 
terms were merged with the GO terms inferred by blastx homology in Blast2GO. 
Annotation augmentation (ANNEX) was performed in Blast2GO. Lists of transcripts 
identified from differential expression co-expression analyses were tested for GO term 
enrichment using Fisher’s Exact Test in Blast2GO. Multiple test correction was 
implemented according to the False Discovery Rate ​(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995)​. 
Enriched or depleted GO terms with three or fewer annotated representatives in a given 
gene set were not considered. 
  
B. Pharmacology Methods 
All solutions were administered to ants​ ​as follows: an ant was collected with an 
aspirator and placed in a 50 mL tube. The 50 mL tube was immersed in ice until the ant 
stopped moving. The ant was tapped out onto a paper towel, and gently grasped by a 
rear leg. To mark the ant, a small dab of oil-based paint (Uni-Paint PX-20) was placed 
on the back of the ant’s head using a small toothpick, using a unique color for each of 
the treatment groups. To feed the solution to the ant, 0.2 µL of aqueous solution was 
placed on the mandibles of the anesthetized ant. The droplet is captured between the 
mandibles via surface tension. The contents of the solution used in each experiment are 
described for each experiment specifically. Where applicable, all drug solutions were 
prepared fresh from powder and ​measured with a Mettler Toledo AT261 Delta Range 
FACT to 0.1 mg accuracy​. After administering a solution to an ant, the ant was placed 
on its lateral side, and it eventually began to move around
 
  
C. Laboratory experiments on the effect of dopamine administration. 
 Foraging ​Pogonomyrmex barbatus​ were collected from adult colonies near 
Phoenix, AZ in 5/2016, and driven to Stanford, CA. Laboratory ants were kept on a 
14:10 LD cycle in a temperature controlled room (74 degrees F). Ants were given ad 
libitum access to wet cotton balls inside of glass tubes for water, and provided apple 
slices and millet seed every 3 days. Ant nests consisted of a foraging arena (2’ x 3’) with 
Fluon-coated sides (BioQuip) that had an open top and was exposed to light, connected 
to a series of smaller plastic boxes (4” x 4” ranging to 8” x 12”) that were kept in the 
dark. Ants for brain dopamine quantification were collected from the foraging arena of 
the laboratory colony. All collected ants were placed into the same container, then 
randomly sorted into three treatment groups.  
For treatment, ants were individually slowed on ice then orally administered 
either pure water (control), water with 3 mg/mL dopamine (3.714 mg/mL dopamine 
hydrochloride salt) (Sigma-Aldrich, PubChem 24277897), or water with 30 mg/mL 
dopamine. The solubility of dopamine in water is 600 g/L (PubChem CID: 681) and all 
dopamine solutions were made immediately before administration. After treatment, ants 
were kept in laboratory conditions in a fluon-coated plastic box. Ants were collected the 
following morning at 9am (day 1 time point) or 3 days after ingestion at 9am (day 3 time 
point). At the time of collection, ants were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 
-80C until dissection. The brain was refrozen in 50 µL PBS on dry ice, then stored at 
-80C until dopamine quantification was performed at the Stanford University Mass 
Spectrometry facility with an internal radiolabeled dopamine standard as follows. 
  
D. Mass spectrometry methods: 
Brain samples containing one ant brain and 50 uL PBS were placed on ice in 1.7 
mL tubes and 5 µL of 5 µM ​d4​-dopamine (dopamine internal standard, Cambridge 
Isotope Laboratories) solution was added followed by 60 µL of 4% formic acid. Samples 
were vigorously pipetted for 60 sec to start the homogenization. After that samples were 
placed in ice water bath and sonicated for 10 minutes twice. Next 400 µL of 0.1 % 
formic acid in cold acetonitrile was added to the sample and sonicated for 10 more 
minutes. Samples were then centrifuge for 10 min @ 4°C @ 14000 rpm, dried under 
nitrogen and reconstituted in 50 µL of HPLC sample buffer (2 mM ammonium formate 
pH 3.2 / 20% Methanol). The separation of derivatized amino acids was performed on 
an HP1100 HPLC system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) using a 150 x 2.10 mm Luna-PFP 
column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) after injection of 5 µL at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. 
Mobile phase A was 2 mM ammonium formate pH 3 in water. Mobile phase B was 2 
mM ammonium formate in methanol. The gradient program was as follows: 0.00-2.00 
min – 20%B, 4.00 min – 80% B, 5 min – 80% B, 6-8 min – 20% B. All samples were 
injected in triplicates. A Quattro Premier triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters, 
Milford MA) was operated in positive electrospray ionization mode. Capillary voltage 
was set to 3.00 kV, and cone voltage was set to 21 V. The detection of the analytes was 
performed in selected reaction monitoring mode (SRM). Two or three precursor ion - 
fragment ion pairs were selected for each analyte and compound specific cone voltage 
and collision energy values were used (see Table S1). Stable isotope labeled 
d4​-dopamine was utilized as an Internal Standard (IS). The most intense transition for 
each analyte was selected for quantitation and the subsequent ones for confirmation. 
 An 8-point dopamine calibration curve was used with all analytes ranging from 2nM to 
4000nM, and ​d4-​dopamine at fixed 5 nmol/mL concentration as an internal standard. 
The LLOD for dopamine was 50 fmol on column and LLOQ was 150 fmol. 
  
E. Field pharmacology experiments 
Behavioral pharmacological experiments were performed with a set of 10 
colonies in 7-8/2016 (D19, D24, D25, D26, D27, D29, D30, D33, D34, D36), and in 9 of 
the same 10 colonies in 8/2017 (all the previous colonies except D34). The colonies 
were near but not on the long-term study site ​(Ingram et al., 2013)​. Foragers were 
collected 1-2 meters from the nest entrance and identified as foragers because they 
were not carrying anything and walked in a straight line off the nest mound towards a 
foraging trail or fan ​(Gordon, 1986)​. The ants were brought back to the laboratory at the 
Southwestern Research Station and randomly sorted into treatment groups, defined as 
follows. In 2016, there were two treatment groups: 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 
Electron Microscopy Sciences), and 3 mg/mL dopamine in 1x PBS group. In 2017, there 
were three treatment groups: 1x PBS, 3 mg/mL dopamine in 1x, and 3 mg/mL 
3-iodo-tyrosine (3IY, Sigma-Aldrich). In both years, each treatment group consisted of 
100-150 foragers per colony, the same number of foragers was used between groups 
for each colony replicate. Ants were returned to their nest mound later the same day 
and most returned marked ants immediately descend into their nest. Foragers of ​P. 
barbatus ​tend to be the oldest ants in the colony, and workers marked while foraging do 
not later switch to perform other tasks ​(Gordon, 1989)​. 
Observations began early the following day before foraging began. Counts of 
foraging trips by marked ants began when the first marked ant was observed to leave 
the nest. For colonies with a single foraging trail, a foraging trip was recorded when a 
marked ant crossed a line ~1-2 meters from the nest entrance on the trail. For colonies 
with more than one foraging trail, a foraging trip was recorded when a marked ant was 
observed leaving the nest entrance, carrying nothing, and walking in a straight line off of 
the nest mound ​(Gordon, 1986)​. In 2016, two colonies were observed each morning in 
alternating observation periods of 15-20 minutes. During each 15-20 minute observation 
period, all foraging trips made by marked ants were marked and counts were recorded 
in 30-second intervals. Foraging counts ended when the colony had stopped foraging 
for the morning and no ants had left the nest for 3 minutes. ​In 2017, one colony was 
observed per day, and outgoing foraging trips of marked ants were counted in 
30-second intervals as before.  
For each colony we calculated the response to drug treatment as the increase in 
foraging trips made by dopamine- or 3IY-treated ants divided by the total number of 
foraging trips made by control-treated foragers. This design minimizes the effects of 
day, as all comparisons are being made between two groups of foragers within the 
same colony on the same day. In each interval the numbers of foraging trips made by 
workers from each treatment were not very different and the results in each interval did 
not always reflect the totals: in only about one-third of the 30-second intervals were 
there were more dopamine-treated foragers than PBS-treated nestmates. 
  
F. Behavioral ecological methods 
 Observation of undisturbed colony foraging behavior occurred during August 
2017. Observation was performed over 12 consecutive days (8/3/17 - 8/14/17) on the 
set of 9 colonies later used in pharmacological experiments. Each colony was 
surrounded with 5 field flags, each placed 1.5 meters from the nest entrance, with the 
first flag pointing due North. On observation days, colonies were observed in a circuit by 
the same observer, in an order that was altered every day. Observation began before 
any colony had begun foraging for the day, at around 5am. If colonies were not foraging 
at all at the time of observation, then the observer proceeded to the next colony 
immediately. An outgoing foraging trip was defined as occurring when an unladen ant 
walked in a straight line off the nest mound and crossed an invisible line between two of 
the field flags surrounding the colony. An incoming foraging trip was defined as 
occurring when an ant crossed an invisible line between two field flags, heading towards 
the nest entrance. If more than 1 incoming and/or outgoing foragers were observed in 
the first 30 second scan per each side of the colony, rates of incoming and outgoing 
foragers were counted in 3 sequential 30-second intervals for that side. Observation of 
focal colonies continued until all colonies had finished foraging for the day. Average 
incoming and outgoing foraging rates per colony per observation were calculated as 
follows. First, the average incoming and outgoing foraging rate per minute per side was 
calculated by doubling the average of the 3 sequential 30-second counts per side. 
Then, the colony overall foraging rate per minute was calculated for each observation 
by summing foraging rates across all 5 sides of the colony. 
The estimated overall number of foraging trips made by each colony each day 
was calculated as the area under the curve of colony overall outgoing foraging rate 
through time, as the integral of outgoing foraging rate through time is the overall number 
of foraging trips. ​The “weatherData” package was used to obtain weather data for all 
foraging days from a climate station near the fieldsite in Rodeo, NM. For each day 
where undisturbed colony behavior was observed, the average relative humidity 
measurement between 07:00 and 12:00 was calculated. Parametric ANOVA modeling 
was used to test for differences among colonies in how their total number of trips per 
day was associated with the daily humidity. To quantify the sensitivity of each colony to 
humidity, the total number of foraging trips made by the colony per day was regressed 
using a Theil-Sen non-parametric estimator (R “mblm” package) against the average 
relative humidity that day. The slope of this regression represents the estimated number 
fewer total foraging trips made by the colony per percent decrease in relative humidity, 
where higher values reflect higher colony sensitivity to humidity.  
To test for a relationship between colony sensitivity to humidity and response to 
pharmacology, the value of the regression slope estimated above was correlated with 
the percent increase in foraging trips made by dopamine-treated ants relative to 
control-treated ants from that colony. Both parametric Pearson and non-parametric 
Kendall correlation tests were performed and correlation estimates are reported in the 
main text. 
  
G. Brain biogenic amine content methods. 
Natural variation in biogenic amine titer among foraging ants from colonies of ​P. 
barbatus​ was measured with High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). 
 Foragers from the 9 focal colonies were collected on the morning of 9/4/2017 between 
7am and 9am. Collected ants were frozen directly into liquid nitrogen, and kept in liquid 
nitrogen or a -80C freezer until dissection in cold citric acid. For HPLC we measured 5 
samples from each of the 9 colonies with collected ants. Each sample consisted of 2 
pooled brains and was measured for dopamine and serotonin content as per Hardie and 
Hirsh ​(Hardie and Hirsh, 2006)​. 
Statistical analysis of natural variation among colonies in forager brain 
neurotransmitter titer was performed in R v3.4.0 with an ANOVA test from the library 
“heplots”. The library “granovaGG” was used to visualize the ANOVA results.
