Abstract
Background: Although multivitamins are widely used by US adults, few prospective studies have investigated their
association with the long- and short-term risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate how multivitamin use is associated with the risk of CVD in initially
healthy men at baseline.
Methods: We studied 18,530 male physicians aged $40 y from the Physicians� Health Study I cohort who were free of
CVD and cancer at baseline (1982). All men provided a wide range of self-reported lifestyle and clinical factors plus intake
of selected foods and dietary supplements. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate multivariable-adjusted
HRs (95% CIs).
Results: During a mean follow-up of 12.2 y (total of 225,287 person-years), there were 1697 incident cases of major CVD
(defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and CVD death). In multivariable-adjusted analyses, no
significant associations were observed among baseline multivitamin users compared with nonusers for the risk of major
CVD events (HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.84, 1.05), whereas a self-reported duration of $20 y at baseline was associated with
lower risk (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.90; P-trend = 0.05). Baseline multivitamin use was also significantly inversely
associated with the risk of cardiac revascularization (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.98). Baseline use of multivitamins was not
significantly associated with other CVD endpoints.
Conclusion: In this long-term prospective study in initially healthy men, multivitamin use for $20 y was associated with a
lower risk of major CVD events.

Introduction
Multivitamins are dietary supplements widely used under the
assumption that they improve or maintain health (1). The prev-
alence of multivitamin use has steadily increased during the past
decade in the United States (2), and more than one-third of
adults report currently taking a daily multivitamin (3). Multi-
vitamin supplements usually include a wide range of low-dose
vitamins and minerals to match RDAs and/or usual dietary
intakes. Multivitamins may prevent atherosclerosis and cardio-
vascular disease (CVD)9 by inhibiting oxidative damage of low-
density lipoproteins (4), reducing blood concentrations of
homocysteine (5), lowering concentrations of inflammatory
markers (6), and improving endothelial function (7).
Given the widespread use of multivitamin supplements and
that many individuals take them in the belief of improving or
maintaining health, surprisingly few prospective studies have
investigated the potential role of multivitamins in CVD preven-
tion. Prospective studies that investigated the risk of CVD
incidence or mortality have reported inconsistent results (8–13).
However, because the majority of them investigated only CVD
mortality and not comprehensively the association with various
CVD endpoints it is difficult to draw any overall conclusion on
whether multivitamins may or may not prevent CVD. In the
Women�s Health Study, there was detailed information on

34595) and a Cofas 2 Marie Curie Fellowship (Sweden).

 multivitamin use and different CVD endpoints and it was
observed that neither baseline nor time-varying multivitamin use
was significantly associated with total CVD incidence; however,
there was a nonsignificant inverse association in time-varying
models of multivitamin use (12). Among studies that focused
on ischemic heart disease (IHD) incidence or mortality, some
observed an inverse association (14–17) and others showed no
association (8, 12, 18, 19). Only 3 studies examined multivitamin
use and stroke and each found no association (12, 14, 18). In
addition, only 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT), the Physi-
cians� Health Study (PHS) II, tested a common multivitamin
formulation with all essential low-dose vitamins and minerals and
reported no effect on total CVD but found a significant 39%
reduction in fatal myocardial infarction (MI) (20). The aim of this
study was to evaluate whether multivitamin use was associated
with the incidence of major CVD events, including MI, stroke,
and CVD death, in a long-term, prospective cohort study in men.
Methods
The PHS was a 2 3 2 factorial RCT testing the effects of aspirin and
b-carotene on cancer and CVD. Starting in 1982, 22,071 male physicians
aged 40–84 y and free of cancer and CVD were randomly assigned into the
trial. At baseline, all of the men completed questionnaires asking about
different lifestyle and clinical factors plus intake of selected food and
dietary supplements. We excluded men with missing information on
dietary supplement use or selected lifestyle, clinical, and dietary factors.
Thus, 18,530 men were followed from baseline through the end of 1995,
when the PHS I trial ended but before the beginning of the PHS II trial,
which included a multivitamin arm (21). All of the men provided written
informed consent, and the PHS I was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of Brigham and Women�s Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.
Multivitamin use status and other covariates. At baseline, all of the
men completed an enrollment questionnaire asking about lifestyle,
clinical, and selected dietary factors, including 4 questions on dietary
supplement use. Multivitamin supplement use was assessed by asking the
participants ‘‘Have you ever taken multiple vitamins regularly?’’ with an
option for ‘‘never,’’ ‘‘past only,’’ or ‘‘current.’’ The questionnaire did not
collect information on whether multivitamins included minerals. Those
who reported current use were asked to provide the brand, years of use,
and number of pills used per week. There were also questions on never,
past, and current use for specific vitamin supplements of vitamins A, C,
and E. At baseline, men also self-reported information on cardiovascular
risk factors such as age, weight, height, smoking status, physical activity,
and clinical factors including history of diabetes, hypercholesterolemia,
hypertension, and alcohol use. BMI was calculated by dividing body
weight (in kg) by square of height (in m). Vegetable intake was calculated
by summing individual fruit and vegetables including broccoli, carrots,
spinach, yellow squash, and tomatoes/tomato juice.
Ascertainment of CVD cases. Incident CVD events, including nonfatal
MI, nonfatal stroke, and cardiac revascularization (coronary artery bypass
grafting and/or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) were
determined from self-reports on annual questionnaires. Reported CVD
events were confirmed by an endpoints committee of physicians. For
confirmation of MI, we used the WHO criteria, which use electrocardio-
gram criteria or abnormal concentrations of cardiac enzymes (22). Stroke
was defined as a typical neurologic deficit, being sudden or rapid in onset and
lasting >24 h, and classified as ischemic, hemorrhagic, or unknown. The
evaluation of stroke in the PHS has previously shown excellent interobserver
agreement (Cohen�s k = 0.96) for stroke subtypes (23, 24). Major CVD
events were defined as first nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or CVD death. We
also examined the first occurrence of individual CVD events [MI, stroke
(total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic), CVD death, cardiac revascularization,
and IHD]. IHD included first events of nonfatal MI, cardiac revasculariza-
tion, and IHD death. The identification of deaths was done through reports
from family members, postal authorities, and by the National Death Index.
Statistical analyses. All statistical analyses were performed with SAS
version 9.3 (SAS Institute). Men were categorized at baseline as 1) no
current use of multivitamins (including never and past) and 2) current
use of multivitamins. We also separately compared never, past, and
current multivitamin users. To investigate the frequency and duration of
multivitamin use, we further categorized current users into <4 or $4
pills/wk and <10, 10 to <20, or $20 y of multivitamin use, respectively.
To assess trends across categories of duration, we used the median value
of each category to create a single continuous variable. We compared
baseline characteristics by calculating age-standardized mean values for
continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables. We used
Cox proportional hazards models to calculate HRs (95% CIs) (25) with
the use of the PHREG procedure. HRs adjusted for baseline age (y,
continuous), randomly assigned treatment (aspirin and b-carotene), BMI
(kg/m2, continuous), smoking status (never, past, or current), vigorous
exercise (rarely/never, <1 time/wk, 1–3 times/wk, or $4 times/wk), and
alcohol consumption (rarely/never, 1–3 drinks/mo, 1–6 drinks/wk, or
$1 drinks/d). In a second model, we further adjusted for family history
of MI, diabetes history, hypertension history, hypercholesterolemia
history, and fruit and vegetable intake (continuous). We tested the
proportional hazards assumption by entering the product of baseline
multivitamin use and the natural logarithm of time in the model, and
there was no evidence of violation of this assumption.
To investigate whether the association between multivitamin use and
major CVD events was modified by potential CVD risk factors, we
performed stratified analyses by age (<70 or $70 y), BMI (<25 or $25),
smoking status (never, past, or current), history of diabetes (yes or no),
hypertension (yes or no), hypercholesterolemia (yes or no), vegetable
intake (<3 or $3 servings/d), and randomly assigned aspirin (yes or no)
and b-carotene (yes or no) treatment. Multiplicative interactions were
tested by using Wald chi-square tests.
Results
Among 18,530 men included in our analyses, 3790 (20%) were
currently taking a multivitamin supplement at baseline in 1982.
In Table 1, we present the baseline characteristics according to
multivitamin use status. Men reporting current use were more
likely to smoke, more likely to be physically active, and less
likely to consume alcohol than were men not taking multivita-
mins. We also investigated baseline characteristics according to
never, past, and current use of multivitamins and observed that
never and past users were similar in their characteristics and
differed from current users with regard to smoking and alcohol
consumption as above.

 During a mean follow-up of 12.2 y (225,287 person-years),
we identified 1697 cases of major CVD events, 815 cases of MI
(101 MI deaths), 670 cases of stroke (569 ischemic, 93
hemorrhagic, and 8 unknown), and 566 cases of CVD death.
We also identified 1400 cases of cardiac revascularization and
1706 cases of IHD (including MI and cardiac revascularization).
The multivariable-adjusted association between current
multivitamin use at baseline compared with no use did not
substantially differ from the age-adjusted association. No
significant associations were observed for major CVD events
(HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.84, 1.05) or for MI, total stroke, ischemic
stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and CVD death (Table 2). However,
baseline multivitamin use was significantly and inversely asso-
ciated with the risk of cardiac revascularization (HR: 0.86; 95%
CI: 0.75, 0.98) and IHD (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.79, 1.00). When
investigating the duration of multivitamin use, we found that
multivitamin use for $20 y compared with no use was inversely
associated with total CVD (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.90; P-
trend = 0.05), total stroke (HR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.96; P-
trend = 0.20), cardiac revascularization (HR: 0.35; 95% CI:
0.17, 0.74; P-trend = 0.10), and IHD (HR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.24,
0.77; P-trend = 0.08) (Table 3). The number of multivitamin
pills used ($4 or <4 pills/wk) compared with no use was not
associated with the risk of major CVD events or individual CVD
components (data not shown).
We further investigated whether the association between
multivitamin use and CVD was modified by other potential
CVD risk factors such as age, BMI, smoking, history of diabetes,
history of hypertension, history of hypercholesterolemia, vege-
table intake, and randomized treatment assignment (Table 4). In
these analyses, we found evidence that the association was
modified by baseline history of diabetes (P-interaction = 0.009),
in which an inverse association was observed among men with
no history (HR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.00) and a higher risk was
observed among men with a history of diabetes (HR: 1.43; 95%
CI: 1.05, 1.96). We also investigated whether there was any
effect modification by the above-mentioned factors for the
association between multivitamin use and IHD. The association
was consistent across categories of age, smoking, history of
diabetes, history of hypertension, history of hypercholesterole-
mia, vegetable intake, and randomized treatment assignment.
However, a significant interaction was observed for BMI
(P-interaction = 0.03), in which multivitamin use was inversely
associated with the risk of IHD (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.94)
among men with a BMI $25, and no association was observed
among men with a BMI <25.
Discussion
In this prospective cohort study in male physicians, there was
no association between current multivitamin use and the risk
of major CVD events, MI, stroke, or CVD death. However,
multivitamin use was significantly associated with a 14% lower
risk of cardiac revascularization. In addition, there were poten-
tially stronger reductions in major CVD events among men who
reported $20 y of multivitamin use with a significant trend;
however, these observations should be interpreted with caution
due to the low number of cases.
To the best of our knowledge, only 1 previous trial investi-
gated the effect of a wide-spectrum, low-dose multivitamin
supplement on CVD incidence (20). The PHS II, which enrolled
14,641 men and followed them for 11.2 y, reported no effect
between random assignment for multivitamin use and total
major CVD events, which is consistent with our findings.
However, there was some evidence that the effect between
randomly assigned multivitamin use and total CVD may be
modified by age (P-interaction = 0.04), with a stronger effect
among men aged $70 y. In our analyses, we did not see any
effect modification by age. However, this could be explained by

 the low number of cases, limiting the statistical power to detect
such associations. Moreover, in the PHS II trial, a significant
39% lower risk was observed for fatal MI (20), which is not
consistent with our observations of no association.
Only 1 previous study, to our knowledge, investigated the
association between multivitamin use and total CVD incidence.
This study, which was performed in the Women�s Health Study
cohort and included 37,193 women followed for 16.2 y, did not
observe an association between baseline multivitamin use and total
CVD, defined as nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or CVD death (12).
Most prospective cohort studies that investigated the associa-
tion between multivitamin use and CVD mortality observed no
association (8–10, 12), which is consistent with our findings. In
contrast, 1 other US study found a 16% lower risk of CVD
mortality in women and men who had a 10-y average frequency of
6–7 multivitamin pills/wk compared with nonusers (11). Moreover,
the NHANES III study with detailed information on supplement
use reported a 44% significantly lower CVD mortality risk among
women and no significant associations among men (13).
In our analyses, we observed a significant 11% lower risk of
IHD defined as incident MI or cardiac revascularization. This is
consistent with previous prospective studies that investigated
multivitamin use in association with IHD (14–17). In a
prospective cohort study in 31,671 Swedish women followed
for 10.2 y, multivitamin supplement use was inversely associated
with incident MI (15). In addition, in the Nurses� Health Study,
regular multivitamin use was significantly associated with a
24% lower risk of incident IHD among women (16). Another
US prospective study in women and men found that the
combined use of multivitamins and supplements of vitamin A,
C, or E was associated with a 25% lower risk of IHD mortality
(14). Moreover, the Women�s Health Initiative in >90,000
American women observed no overall association with incident
MI; however, a significant inverse association was observed for
multivitamins containing vitamin and mineral amounts >200%
of RDAs (18). Only a few prospective cohort studies examined
the association between multivitamin supplement use and the
risk of stroke (12, 14, 18). All of the studies reported no
associations, which is in agreement with our observations.
Although our results suggest that continuous multivitamin
use over a longer duration may be significantly associated with a
lower risk of major CVD, the low number of cases supporting
these results indicates that they should be interpreted with
caution. A lower risk of IHD associated with long-term
multivitamin use for $20 y is consistent with findings in men of
the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, in whom $10 y of

 self-reported multivitamin use at baseline was associated with a
significant 25% reduced risk of IHD (17). Another study in
American women and men found that $5 y of combined use of
multivitamins and supplements of vitamin A, C, or E was
inversely associated with IHD mortality (14). In the Swedish
Mammography Cohort, a stronger inverse association for MI was
also observed among women who used multivitamins for $5 y
(15). Finally, in the Women�s Health Study, a longer duration of
reported multivitamin use at baseline was not associated with the
risk of major CVD, MI, stroke, or CVD death (12).
The precise mechanisms through which long-term multivita-
min use may be more strongly associated with CVD are unclear
from observational studies and may reflect residual confounding
by healthy behaviors. Alternatively, a longer period of time may
be necessary for multivitamins to affect the long-term develop-
ment of CVD.
We observed that the association between multivitamin use
and the risk of major CVD events was modified by baseline
history of diabetes, with a reduced risk of major CVD among
nondiabetic men and an increased risk among diabetic men.
Effect modification by diabetes may be explained by the
possibility that men might start taking multivitamins after
they are diagnosed with diabetes and therefore a stronger
inverse association is observed when restricting analyses to
nondiabetic men.
Multivitamins are supplements that typically include a wide
range of vitamins and minerals in doses that correspond to those
found in the usual diet. Many of the included vitamins and
minerals may prevent CVD development through several
hypothesized mechanisms. Low-density lipoproteins transport
antioxidants such as a-tocopherol and b-carotene, which may
inhibit oxidative damage of these particles (4). In vitro studies
have shown that vitamin C may also protect low-density
lipoproteins from oxidation by interacting with a-tocopherol
and b-carotene (26). Folate, vitamin B-6, and vitamin B-12 are
important components in homocysteine metabolism and defi-
ciencies of these vitamins may therefore contribute to athero-
sclerotic and thrombotic events (5). Vitamin D deficiency may
cause CVD mediated through mechanisms involved in athero-
sclerosis and endothelial dysfunction (6). Magnesium is a cofactor
included in antioxidant enzymes and therefore of importance in
preventing oxidative stress and may also act through other
mechanisms involving endothelial and vascular smooth cells (7).
Endothelial selenoproteins regulate vascular tone, cell adhe-
sion, and apoptosis and may also be involved in inflammatory
processes and atherogenesis (27).
Strengths of our study include the use of a large prospective
cohort with high-quality information on different lifestyle and
clinical factors. We also had detailed data on various endpoints,
including MI, stroke, CVD death, and cardiac revascularization,

 allowing us to comprehensively examine a potential role of
multivitamins in CVD prevention. Moreover, we had minimal loss
to follow-up, with morbidity and mortality follow-up rates >99%.
There are also important limitations to our study. We
investigated only self-reported multivitamin use at baseline
and did not account for time-varying multivitamin use. More-
over, the definition of multivitamin use is extremely broad and
includes supplements with varying doses and included vitamins
and minerals, which complicates the interpretation of study
results and the comparability of findings across studies. Next,
the present study included male physicians, who may differ from
the general population in terms of lifestyle and clinical risk
factors as well as baseline nutritional status, which affects
generalizability to other populations. As in any observational
study we cannot exclude the possibility that measurement error
in self-reported multivitamin use may have biased our results
toward the null. In addition, our observed findings may be
driven by uncontrolled and residual confounding from other
healthy behavior–related factors. It was previously observed in a
cross-sectional study in PHS II participants that self-reported use
of multivitamins was positively associated with healthy lifestyle
and dietary factors as well as with having a history of cancer and
cardiovascular intermediates such as hypercholesterolemia and
hypertension (28). A well-designed RCT may alleviate concerns
about residual and unmeasured confounding. However, the
generalizability of the study results and the ability to test a range
of exposures may be limited. In contrast, an observational study
may allow for a broader exploration of multivitamin doses and
usage habits. Thus, observational studies and RCTs can com-
plement each other and be used together to help determine the
potential benefits and risks of daily multivitamin use in adults.
In conclusion, in this prospective study in men, we observed
that baseline multivitamin use was associated with a lower risk
of cardiac revascularization. No association was observed with
major CVD events, including MI, stroke, or CVD death.
However, men who reported $20 y of use at baseline had a
lower risk of major CVD events. Future large-scale RCTs and
focused observational studies with detailed information on
multivitamin use are needed to confirm or refute our findings.
