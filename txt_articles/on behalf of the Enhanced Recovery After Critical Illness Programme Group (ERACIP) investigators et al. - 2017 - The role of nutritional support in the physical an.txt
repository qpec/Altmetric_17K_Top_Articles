Abstract
The lack of benefit from randomised controlled trials has resulted in significant controversy regarding the role of nutrition
during critical illness in terms of long-term recovery and outcome. Although methodological caveats with a failure to
adequately appreciate biological mechanisms may explain these disappointing results, it must be acknowledged that
nutritional support during early critical illness, when considered alone, may have limited long-term functional impact.
This narrative review focuses specifically on recent clinical trials and evaluates the impact of nutrition during critical illness
on long-term physical and functional recovery.
Specific focus on the trial design and methodological limitations has been considered in detail. Limitations include
delivery of caloric and protein targets, patient heterogeneity, short duration of intervention, inappropriate clinical
outcomes and a disregard for baseline nutritional status and nutritional intake in the post-ICU period.
With survivorship at the forefront of critical care research, it is imperative that nutrition studies carefully consider
biological mechanisms and trial design because these factors can strongly influence outcomes, in particular long-term
physical and functional outcome. Failure to do so may lead to inconclusive clinical trials and consequent rejection of the
potentially beneficial effects of nutrition interventions during critical illness.

Background
Many basic questions about the provision of nutritional
support to critically ill patients remain unanswered [1].
Outcome from critical illness has previously been mea-
sured using relatively blunt outcome measure tools such
as mortality, days on mechanical ventilation and rates of
acquired infection. Recent randomised controlled trials
(RCTs) have not shown any mortality benefit when spe-
cific nutritional interventions have been investigated
over the first week of critical illness [2–4] and other
studies have reported harm [5–7]. This has led to useful
debate regarding the most appropriate timing, type and
amount of nutrition support that should be delivered to
critically ill patients.
It is generally accepted that providing some enteral
nutrition (EN) early (within 48–72 hours of admission)
modulates the immune response and reduces oxidative
stress and infections by limiting bacterial translocation
via the gut [1, 8, 9]. In addition, provision of nutrition
over the course of critical illness may alter the compos-
ition and function of the host microbiome [10], further
influencing the immune response. However, the clinical
impact of this physiological observation is unknown. In
contrast, it has been hypothesised that early feeding
blunts autophagy, preventing adequate clearance of
damaged cells and resulting in muscle wasting and in-
creased muscle weakness [1, 7].
As the number of patients surviving critical illness has
risen, there has been an increase in reported physical
and functional disability as well as impairment of quality

 of life following discharge from the intensive care unit
(ICU) [11–13]. Body composition and physical and func-
tional impairment have been measured using a variety of
tools at different time points over the course of critical
illness and the patient’s recovery trajectory [14, 15]. At
least 33 different measures of skeletal muscle mass,
strength and function have been identified for use in
critically ill patients [14]. These measures include both
volitional and non-volitional tools, with varying reliabil-
ity and validity. Currently, the most appropriate measure
to use at each time point and for each intervention is
unknown. Whichever measure is used, it is clear that re-
covery in survivors from critical illness is poor, even up
to 5 years post discharge from the ICU [13].
Skeletal muscle weakness, termed intensive care unit-
acquired weakness (ICU-AW), contributes significantly
to the physical and functional disability observed in
these patients. Skeletal muscle wasting, both early in
critical illness [16] and potentially ongoing as a result of
persistent inflammatory catabolic syndrome (PICS) [17],
has been identified as a contributing factor to ICU-AW
[18]. Furthermore, low skeletal muscle mass on admis-
sion to the ICU has been shown to be a predictor of
poor outcome [19]. It is here, in the reduction of skeletal
muscle wasting and the recovery of survivors of critical
illness, that nutrition support may prove the most bene-
ficial, but there is remarkably little nutrition research
specifically focusing on these outcomes.
The aims of early nutrition support in critically ill
patients are often cited as the reduction of catabolism,
attenuation of muscle wasting and maintenance of
nutritional status [8, 9]. However, to date there has been
limited focus on muscle wasting and functional perform-
ance as outcomes in critical care nutrition trials. This
narrative review will discuss clinical trials which have
evaluated the physical and functional impact of critical
care nutrition interventions, either as secondary out-
comes, sub-studies or post-hoc analyses, as well as the
effect of timing, type and amount of nutrition support
on recovery following critical illness. Particular attention
will be given to factors that should be considered in the
design of future RCTs of nutrition in this patient group,
which will probably benefit from adoption of a transla-
tional science approach.
Timing of nutrition support
Most experts and guidelines agree that EN should be
commenced within 24–48 hours of admission to the
ICU [1, 8, 20, 21]. Early EN is encouraged to assist with
the maintenance of gut integrity, modulation of the
stress and immune response and attenuation of disease
severity [22, 23], which may, in turn, improve overall
outcome [24]. The most recent meta-analysis of trials in-
vestigating the effect of early EN was performed as part
of the joint American Society for Parenteral Nutrition
(ASPEN) and Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM)
guidelines for the provision of nutrition support in crit-
ical illness [8]. This systematic review identified 21 RCTs
meeting their inclusion criteria and found that provision
of early EN was associated with a significant reduction
in mortality and infectious morbidity compared with
withholding early EN (delayed EN or standard care) [8].
In contrast to this convincing evidence, others argue
that anorexia may be a preserved evolutionary response
and that early starvation or limiting nutritional intake
over the first 48–72 hours to the first week of critical ill-
ness is beneficial [25, 26]. This notion contrasts with re-
sults
of
many
observational
studies
reporting
that
feeding via the enteral route alone leads to significant
underfeeding which in turn is negatively associated with
the standard outcome measures of mortality, length of
stay and infection frequency [27–30]. As a consequence
of these findings, the use of PN has increased over re-
cent years, which raises further questions in relation to
the timing of nutrition support.
In the large EPaNIC trial (Early Parenteral Nutrition
Completing Enteral Nutrition in Adult Critically Ill Pa-
tients) [7], the use of early PN to supplement early insuf-
ficient EN led to greater muscle weakness, thought to be
related to impaired autophagy [31]. For this reason, the
use of PN (either exclusive or supplemental) is not
recommended over the first 7 days of ICU admission in
patients who are not considered to be at high nutritional
risk [8].
Despite these opposing views, studies investigating the
impact of withholding nutrition completely over the first
week of critical illness do not exist and guidelines con-
tinue to recommend increasing nutrition support over
the first week of critical illness to meet target recom-
mendations [8, 20, 21]. Additionally, studies undertaken
after the first week of critical illness, and indeed in the
post-ICU phase, are lacking. This will be discussed later
in the review, but essentially the impact of usual nutri-
tional practice in the ICU on the physical and functional
recovery of ICU patients is unknown.
The presumed benefit of nutritional support during
critical illness, in order to reduce muscle wasting, is
based on three assumptions. The first assumption is that
all patients absorb all of the nutrients delivered; the sec-
ond is that the critically ill skeletal muscle can utilise the
nutrients which are delivered; and the third assumption
is that the consequence of these processes is always an
anabolic and never a catabolic effect [32]. Contrary to
these assumptions, delays in gastric emptying [33] and
incomplete absorption from the small bowel [34] may
significantly alter the presumed benefit. In addition, little
is known about the ability of skeletal muscle to utilise
these nutrients at different time points over the ICU

 admission. It is possible that current feeding methods
may not physiologically be able to produce the desired
outcome benefit or that provision of nutrients does not
result in anabolism, particularly in the earliest phase of
critical illness (e.g. first 48–72 hours) [35] or in clinical
conditions defined by persistent inflammation and hyp-
oxia [16]. Studies investigating the anabolic effect of nu-
trition at different time points over the course of critical
illness and recovery are required to provide further guid-
ance on the most appropriate timing of nutrition sup-
port in order to influence these outcomes.
Dose of nutrition support
Energy
In general, critically ill patients do not meet recommended
levels of nutritional intake, particularly when the enteral
route is used alone [36]. This is true both in routine clin-
ical practice [36] and in the setting of RCTs [2–4]. The ef-
fect of underfeeding during the period of critical illness on
skeletal muscle wasting and physical function is wholly
unclear. One-year follow-up from the EDEN trial (Early vs
Delayed Enteral Feeding to Treat People with Acute Lung
Injury or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) suggested
that there was no beneficial effect on physical function
from target compared with trophic enteral feeding over
the first 6 days of critical illness [37], albeit in the context
of a number of confounders that would need further con-
sideration. However, more patients in the trophic feeding
group were discharged to rehabilitation centres, suggest-
ing that there may be some beneficial effect to improving
nutritional intakes [37]. Noteworthy in this trial is that pa-
tients in the full feeding group only met 70% of the energy
targets which may not be sufficient to produce an out-
come benefit, at least when predictive equations are used
[30]. In contrast, a sub-group analysis from the Reducing
Deaths due to Oxidative Stress Study (REDOXs) found
that increasing nutritional adequacy led to improvements
in 3-month Short Form-36 (SF-36) scores relating to the
physical domains. However, this effect was diminished by
6 months [38]. Other large RCTs have also included phys-
ical or quality of life outcomes with varying results
(Table 1) [2, 3, 31, 38–42].
Two pre-planned sub-group analyses from the EPaNIC
study investigated the impact of the macronutrient dose
(in the form of early vs late supplemental PN) on rates
of skeletal muscle wasting [31, 39]. The first of these
[31] found that muscle wasting, measured from muscle
biopsies, was not different between the two groups. In
addition, using the Medical Research Council (MRC)
sum-score, weakness was found to recover faster in the
group receiving late PN. In the second of these sub-
group analyses [39], early PN was shown to adversely
impact on femoral muscle quality, measured using
computed tomography (CT) scans, but did not affect the
rates of wasting observed in 15 neurosurgical patients.
It is likely that the timing and dose of energy provision
go hand in hand. Indeed, recent thinking suggests that
consideration of the endogenous production of energy in
early critical illness is essential to the timing and dose of
nutritional supplementation [1]. However, with no bed-
side method to measure endogenous energy production,
it is impossible to account for this when calculating en-
ergy expenditure and devising feeding regimens. It has
been postulated that in early critical illness (e.g. within
the first 72–96 hours) permissive underfeeding to ap-
proximately 15 kcal/kg with full protein nutrition sup-
port may be warranted [43], but this awaits confirmation
of benefit in RCTs. In addition, the use of predictive
equations to determine energy targets may heavily influ-
ence the results of nutrition trials in the ICU as they are
known to produce results which are less accurate than
measured energy expenditure (MEE) using indirect calor-
imetry [44]. Indeed, studies feeding to MEE have consist-
ently shown positive benefits and a recent observational
study found that feeding to 70% of MEE was optimal in
terms of mortality [45]. However, limitations preclude the
frequent use of indirect calorimetry in clinical practice.
These include availability of accurate metabolic monitors,
costs, time taken to undertake the measurement and spe-
cific exclusions meaning that some of the sickest patients
are unsuitable for measurement (e.g. those on continuous
renal replacement therapy and those with high oxygen re-
quirements) [46]. However, the introduction to the market
of a metabolic monitor designed specifically for mechanic-
ally ventilated patients, with a reasonable cost, is under
development and may bypass some of these limitations
for future trials [46]. This is particularly pertinent as the
effect of this targeted energy feeding on physical and func-
tional recovery remains unknown.
Protein
Inadequate protein provision has been considered a con-
tributing factor explaining why RCTs, such as the EDEN
trial mentioned earlier [3], do not show any beneficial
impact of nutrition in the critically ill [47]. Early studies
investigating protein intake in critically ill patients re-
ported an improvement in whole-body nitrogen balance
or whole-body protein turnover, with higher protein in-
takes [48]. Since then, several large observational studies
have reported mortality benefits when higher protein de-
livery is achieved [49–51]. Whilst this may, in part, be
because less sick patients may be able to have more protein
delivered, this important confounder is accounted for in
many of the more recent studies. For this reason, current
recommendations range between 1.2 and 2.5 g/kg/day [8].
Whilst it seems plausible that higher protein delivery may

 enhancement of muscle strength and function are lacking
[52]. Secondary outcome results relating to the physical
function component of the SF-36 score from the Nephro-
Protective Trial [53], investigating the effect of intravenous
amino acid supplementation on development of acute kid-
ney injury, are awaited to contribute to the current evi-
dence base.
One recent RCT investigated the effect of different
protein intakes on muscle strength, wasting and fatigue
in critically ill patients receiving PN [42]. In this study,
119 patients were randomised to receive 0.8 or 1.2 g/kg
protein. There was no difference in the primary outcome
of handgrip strength at ICU discharge. However, despite
a smaller than planned difference in the delivery of pro-
tein (0.9 g/kg vs 1.1 g/kg), the study found that a higher
protein intake resulted in differences in secondary out-
comes including greater handgrip strength at day 7, im-
proved measures of forearm muscle thickness and rectus
femoris cross-sectional area and reduced fatigue scores.
These results support the concept that a higher protein
intake, at least when supplied via the parenteral route,
leads to a reduction in muscle wasting during the first
week of critical illness. However, such preliminary find-
ings await confirmation in larger studies that would, in
particular, need to correct for baseline heterogeneity, as
these results are in contrast to observational data from
the EPaNIC Study [31, 39] and from the MUSCLE-UK
group where higher protein delivery was observed to be
associated with greater skeletal muscle wasting [16].
Taken together, these data have led to the hypothesis
that it may not be the amount of protein delivered, but
the way in which we deliver the feed in a continuous
manner that drives skeletal muscle wasting [32]. In
healthy subjects, muscle protein synthesis increases from
45 to 90 minutes after provision of amino acids, either
oral or intravenous, but then decreases after 90 minutes
[54, 55]. This effect is observed despite the continued
availability of amino acids in both the plasma and
muscle, and has been termed the ‘muscle full effect’. It is
not unreasonable to consider that this effect is also rele-
vant in critically ill patients, and this hypothesis underpins
the rationale for the current multi-centre RCT comparing
intermittent and continuous feeding to investigate the ef-
fect on skeletal muscle wasting [35].
Methodological challenges
Patient selection
One of the major challenges in demonstrating benefit
from nutrition in critically ill patients is the heteroge-
neous nature of the clinical population. In this regard it
is unlikely that all patients will benefit from the same
treatment at the same time point. Whilst feeding proto-
cols are recommended as a means of encouraging early
enteral feeding, a ‘one size fits all’ approach to the
treatment of critically ill patients is no longer considered
appropriate. However, defining patients who are likely to
benefit from a nutritional intervention will be challen-
ging and will require rigorous investigation. One method
currently suggested to distinguish those patients who
may benefit from a targeted nutrition intervention from
those who may not is the determination of nutrition risk.
The most popular nutritional risk scoring systems for
critically ill patients are the Nutrition Risk Score 2002
(NRS 2002) [56] and the Nutrition Risk in the Critically
Ill (NUTRIC) score [57, 58]. Although recent clinical tri-
als have used the NRS 2002 in their inclusion criteria,
this score may lack the specificity to determine the true
nutrition risk of critically ill patients as an APACHE II
score > 10 automatically gives the highest risk score. Al-
though the NUTRIC score was developed specifically for
critically ill patients, it is yet to be validated prospect-
ively. However, post-hoc analyses from the PermiT (The
Permissive Underfeeding versus target Enteral Feeding
in Adult Critically Ill Patients) trial did not show a mor-
tality improvement when stratifying by this score [59].
In addition, these scoring systems do not include vari-
ables relating to muscle mass or baseline physical func-
tion therefore more work is required in the area of
nutrition risk before it can be used as a criterion in fu-
ture nutrition studies.
Potential tools for patient selection in clinical trials in-
clude those to determine both baseline skeletal muscle
quantity and quality and change over time. Such tools
include muscle ultrasound and CT. However, there are
limitations with the use of these tools outside the re-
search setting. First, there is currently no standardised,
universal technique to perform muscle ultrasound [60];
and second, only patients who have required a CT scan
for clinical purposes have been investigated, meaning
that a selection bias may be present [61]. Nonetheless,
with further work to standardise techniques, these mea-
sures may prove useful in the future either on their own
or as an adjunct to existing nutrition risk tools. Lastly, if
physical or functional outcomes are to be included as
important clinical outcomes, then the limitations sur-
rounding obtaining baseline measurements for non-
elective ICU admissions will be equally as important and
further work needs to be undertaken to understand this
in detail.
Delivery of the intervention
Ensuring adequate delivery of the intervention is an es-
sential factor in being able to interpret the outcome of
such studies. Several studies in critical care nutrition
have not been successful in reaching either target energy
or protein delivery (Table 1) [2–4, 7, 40–42]. Notwith-
standing that there may be physiological differences in the
utilisation of substrates depending on the route and
Bear et al. Critical Care  (2017) 21:226 
Page 6 of 10
 timing of nutrition delivery, strategies to enhance nutri-
tion delivery [62, 63] should be factored into clinical trials
where the outcome is dependent upon meeting a target.
Duration of the intervention
Biological plausibility is fundamental to any nutrition re-
search. This includes the likelihood that an outcome will
be observed at a particular time point as a result of the
specified duration of an intervention. Effects from nutri-
tion dosing are unlikely to be observed immediately and
any effect will be reliant on the consistency of delivery
of the intervention. For example, the EDEN trial re-
ported no difference in physical outcomes at 1 year
when trophic or full feeding was given for 6 days [37].
Given that current data suggest that oral intake is inad-
equate post extubation [64, 65] and in the post-ICU re-
covery phase [66], it may be unlikely that an effect
would be observed 1 year after such a short intervention.
Observational studies tend to include patients fed
over a longer period of time and exclude those pa-
tients fed over shorter durations. Because of the risk
of bias associated with the short duration of trials, we
propose that critical care nutrition studies should
continue for longer than the first week of critical ill-
ness and should consider post-ICU nutritional intake.
Outcomes
Whilst it is acknowledged that outcomes research is a
priority for survivors of critical illness, no consensus ex-
ists on the most appropriate outcomes. There is consid-
erable current activity in relation to core outcome sets
in studies of physical rehabilitation [67] and long-term
follow-up following acute respiratory failure [68] but no
such initiative is ongoing for nutrition. Core outcome
sets enable the combination and comparison of data
from different studies of similar interventions and are
urgently required in this field. Indeed, a recent scoping
review of outcome measurement in ICU survivorship re-
search from 1970–2013 found that 250 unique measure-
ment instruments have been used across 425 studies [69].
Furthermore, only 31 RCTs included post-discharge out-
comes and half of these had sample sizes of less than 100
subjects. Recent large trials undertaken in critical care nu-
trition have continued this pattern and utilised a variety of
primary outcome measures from mortality to infectious
complications and length of stay [2–4, 7, 40, 41, 70].
Whilst meta-analysis of such data is possible, the number
of different outcome measures used profoundly limits the
validity of any conclusions.
None of the large nutrition RCTs has used functional
or health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measures as
primary outcomes, but rather they have been included
as secondary outcomes. This seems surprising, given
that these are likely to be the outcomes where nutrition
may show the most benefit [71], but reflects the current
uncertainty regarding the most appropriate measure to
use across the continuum of critical illness and recovery
[14]. It is common that a significant number of patients
are effectively excluded from recording of physical and
functional ability due to either the volitional nature of
the measure [72] or due to logistical issues with return-
ing to follow-up appointments. Overall, these outcome
measures can be labour intensive and expensive for the
researcher, which may also impact on the choice of out-
comes used for each study, the time points chosen to
measure and the number of patients able to be followed
up long term. Accounting for logistics and costs associ-
ated with measuring long-term outcomes is essential to
the success of future trials.
Recovery from critical illness
There are few studies investigating nutritional support
after the first week of critical illness. However, oral intake
has been reported to be inadequate in patients following
extubation [64, 65], regardless of the presence of enteral
feeding [65]. Failure to meet nutritional targets following
the first week of ICU stay and into the post-ICU phase
may indeed negatively influence any long-term measure-
ments of skeletal muscle mass and physical or functional
ability, and may be a confounder in studies measuring
these outcomes in recent clinical trials. In addition, post-
ICU studies which have included varying degrees of nutri-
tion intervention have shown conflicting results [73, 74]
and therefore little is understood about the clinical effect-
iveness of these interventions in the post-ICU phase How-
ever, it is clear that this is a research priority [75].
Furthermore, the investigation of multi-modal inter-
ventions, coupling appropriate nutrition and exercise in-
terventions at specific time points, is warranted given
the physiological evidence that increases in muscle mass
and improvements in exercise capability are stronger
when these interventions are provided in tandem [15].
Indeed, a study investigating the effects of a combined
nutrition and exercise intervention in the ICU is due to
commence later this year [76]. The outcome of extend-
ing the combination of these two interventions in the
post-ICU phase should also be investigated.
Conclusion
As survivorship after critical illness becomes an increas-
ing focus of attention, future trials of nutrition during
and following critical illness should consider specific fac-
tors that could provide measureable benefits in terms of
both physical and functional recovery. Such factors in-
clude strategies to ensure adequate delivery of the inter-
vention, provision of nutrition over a time frame in
which it is biologically plausible to observe a difference
in the desired outcome and selection of appropriate and

 consistent outcomes recorded at clinically relevant time
points. Important outcomes include muscle mass, func-
tion and quality of life. In addition, patient selection of
those most likely to benefit from nutritional interven-
tions and nutrition research in the post-ICU phase
merits specific attention.
