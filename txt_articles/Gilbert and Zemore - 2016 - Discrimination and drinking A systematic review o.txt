Abstract
Although it is widely accepted that discrimination is associated with heavy and hazardous 
drinking, particularly within stress and coping frameworks, there has been no comprehensive 
review of the evidence. In response, we conducted a systematic review of the English language 
peer-reviewed literature to summarize studies of discrimination and alcohol-related outcomes, 
broadly defined. Searching six online data bases, we identified 937 non-duplicative titles published 
between 1980 and 2015, of which 97 met all inclusion criteria for our review and reported 
quantitative tests of associations between discrimination and alcohol use. We extracted key study 
characteristics and assessed quality based on reported methodological details. Papers generally 
supported a positive association; however, the quantity and quality of evidence varied 
considerably. The largest number of studies was of racial/ethnic discrimination among African 
Americans in the United States, followed by sexual orientation and gender discrimination. Studies 
of racial/ethnic discrimination were notable for their frequent use of complex modeling (i.e., 
mediation, moderation) but focused nearly exclusively on interpersonal discrimination. In contrast, 
studies of sexual orientation discrimination (i.e., heterosexism, homophobia) examined both 
internalized and interpersonal aspects; however, the literature largely relied on global tests of 
association using cross-sectional data. Some populations (e.g., Native Americans, Asian and 
Pacific Islanders) and types of discrimination (e.g., systemic/structural racism; ageism) received 
scant attention. This review extends our knowledge of a key social determinant of health through 
alcohol use. We identified gaps in the evidence base and suggest directions for future research 
related to discrimination and alcohol misuse.

  Background
From the late 1980s onward, studies began reporting an association between racism and 
poorer cardiovascular health among African Americans in the United States (Armstead, 
Lawler, Gorden, Cross, & Gibbons, 1989; Krieger & Sidney, 1996; McNeilly et al., 1995). 
Over subsequent decades, researchers across multiple disciplines extended this initial 
observation, finding associations between discrimination and negative health outcomes in a 
variety of populations. With recent, growing recognition of health inequities, discrimination 
has been identified as a social mechanism responsible, at least in part, for observed health 
disparities among minority groups (Commission on the Social Determinants of Health, 
2008; Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, ND).
Several theories suggest that discrimination should be associated with alcohol use. For 
example, the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) has 
been widely used as an organizing heuristic in studies of heavy and hazardous drinking. 
Although the Transactional Model does not identify specific stressors, it may be self-evident 
that discrimination would be experienced as a stressor. Extending the basic framework, 
Minority Stress Models (R. Clark, Anderson, Clark, & Williams, 1999; Harrell, 2000; 
Meyer, 2003), which posit that members of minority groups will experience excess stress 
related to their minority status (i.e., above and beyond what is otherwise expected), have 
identified discrimination as a specific risk exposure. Most recently, the Social Resistance 
Framework (Factor, Kawachi, & Williams, 2011) suggests that minorities may engage in 
health compromising behaviors, such as substance use, as conscious or unconscious acts of 
resistance against a majority group. Specifically, the social forces responsible for majority-
minority distinctions, including experiences of discrimination, may trigger alienation or lack 
of attachment to the dominant culture, which in turn could lead to behaviors in opposition to 
dominant norms. In each of these theoretical frameworks, discrimination may be associated 
with mal-adaptive coping responses, including heavy drinking.
As studies of discrimination and health outcomes have accumulated, a number of previous 
reviews have attempted to make sense of the literature. In 1999, Krieger (1999) published 
the first review, arguing for the importance of an epidemiological analysis of discrimination, 
outlining key methods, and summarizing the early evidence. Among 20 papers dealing 
predominantly with racial/ethnic discrimination, a wide variety of physical and mental 
health outcomes were studied; however, alcohol use was absent. Following closely in 2000, 
Williams and Williams-Morris (2000) reviewed 15 studies of mental health outcomes in 
community samples, devoting considerable attention to conceptualizing how discrimination 
might operate and proposing future areas of research. The papers included in that review 
reported associations between racial/ethnic discrimination and psychological distress, 
depression, and anxiety. Yet again, no study examined alcohol use. Shortly thereafter, 
Williams and colleagues (2003) conducted a subsequent review that included physical, 
mental, and behavioral health outcomes. Of 86 studies examined, only two examined alcohol 
use, both finding a positive association with discrimination; however, important details were 
lacking. For example, hazardous drinking was not distinguished from any alcohol use, and 
the review excluded studies done with college students, a priority population for alcohol 
research. That same year, two additional reviews appeared, both focused on the relationship

 between racial/ethnic discrimination and cardiovascular outcomes (Brondolo, Rieppi, Kelly, 
& Gerin, 2003; Wyatt et al., 2003). These papers reflected the state of US health disparities 
research, which was driven by growing recognition of stark inequities among African 
Americans. Consistent with other reviews, both papers devoted considerable attention to 
potential mechanisms through which discrimination might exert an effect on health; 
however, the narrow focus on cardiovascular disease did little to extend substance abuse 
research.
The first systematic review appeared in 2006, in which Paradies (2006) continued the focus 
on racial/ethnic discrimination as the risk exposure but extended the sample to include 
studies with a variety of health outcomes. Of 138 studies reviewed, 14 addressed alcohol 
use, presenting mixed findings. Eight found positive associations but six reported no 
association. Despite a more rigorous approach than previous reviews, important details were 
lacking. Notably, hazardous drinking was not distinguished from any alcohol use. 
Subsequently, Pascoe and Richman (2009) conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis 
of 134 papers. Among the review’s strengths, it included multiple forms of discrimination 
and proposed a conceptual model of the relationship between discrimination and mental and 
physical health outcomes. Alcohol was included as a search term, however, it was collapsed 
with tobacco use and illicit drug use to model the latent construct of health damaging coping 
behaviors, thus obscuring the relationship between discrimination and drinking. Most 
recently, Paradies and colleagues (2015) reviewed 333 papers, representing the most 
ambitious summary to date. They conducted a meta-analysis of racial ethnic discrimination 
on general, physical, and mental health outcomes. Although the study described in detail the 
inverse relationship between racism and health, it did not include substance use as a 
potential outcome. Thus, it did little to advance our understanding of the relationship 
between discrimination and alcohol-related outcomes.
Although a positive association with alcohol use is widely accepted, particularly within 
stress and coping frameworks, there have been few attempts to assess its support. Previous 
reviews have combined drinking with other substance use or neglected to examine it at all. 
Thus, the degree to which our received wisdom corresponds to empirical findings remains 
unknown. Compounding the challenge, multiple drinking outcomes have been studied, 
ranging from any alcohol consumption to various types of hazardous drinking, such as binge 
episodes (defined as four/five or more drinks on a single occasion for women and men, 
respectively), drinking-related problems (e.g., failure to fulfill work, family, or social 
obligations), and symptoms of dependence (e.g., craving, tolerance, delirium tremens). 
Seeking a rigorous assessment of the evidence, we conducted a systematic review to 
summarize empirical findings about discrimination and alcohol-related outcomes, broadly 
defined. Additionally, we assessed characteristics of studies, such as the types of 
discrimination studied, measures used, sampling methods, and analytic strategies, among 
others. In effect, this review sought to provide both a summary of the evidence (i.e., what is 
known) and an overview of methods (i.e., how that knowledge was produced).

  Methods
We utilized standard procedures for systematic reviews (Egger, Smith, & Altman, 2001; 
Glasziou, 2001), following the PRISMA guidelines (http://www.prisma-statement.org/
Default.aspx) and registering this project in the PROSPERO database (www.crd.york.ac.uk/
prospero). As it did not constitute human subjects research, ethics board approval was not 
required. We searched six online databases (e.g., PubMed) using combinations of controlled 
vocabulary (e.g., MeSH terms such as “alcohol-related disorders”) and free text to identify 
potentially relevant papers (search details in Appendix A). Following Jones’ typology 
(2000), we accepted studies of discrimination at multiple social-ecological levels, such as 
systemic/structural, interpersonal, and internalized discrimination. To be included in this 
review, papers must have reported quantitative findings in a peer-reviewed journal between 
January 1, 1980 and December 31, 2015. Qualitative and non-empirical works, such as 
commentaries or book reviews, were excluded. Likewise, manuscripts that had not 
undergone peer review, such as dissertations or conference abstracts, were not included. 
After removing duplicate citations, we screened titles and abstracts, excluding papers if they 
did not report findings from human research, if discrimination was not a risk exposure, if 
there was no alcohol outcome, if the paper did not test the relationship between 
discrimination and an alcohol-related outcome, or if the paper was not written in English. 
Next, the full text of eligible papers was retrieved for a second, detailed review to confirm 
eligibility. Screenings were completed by the first author and a research assistant. Periodic 
reliability checks of sub-sets of papers that included the second author showed almost 
perfect agreement among screeners (all κ>.90). Any discrepancy about inclusion of papers 
was resolved through discussion of each case. We reviewed bibliographies and conducted 
several targeted searches by investigator name to identify other potential papers. Of 938 non-
duplicative titles, 398 were retrieved for full text review, of which 97 met all inclusion 
criteria and were included in this analysis (Figure 1).
Key study characteristics were identified using a data extraction form and entered into a 
spreadsheet for analysis by the first author and a research assistant. If papers included 
sequential or hierarchical models, we took findings from the final, fully adjusted model. We 
derived a quality index from six characteristics (study design, sampling strategy, use of 
established measures for the exposure and outcome, appropriate analytic procedures, and 
attention to threats to internal validity) categorizing papers as low, moderately good, or high 
quality. We analyzed the extracted data by discrimination type, looking for patterns and 
themes across studies using matrix displays, a common data reduction technique in 
qualitative research (Miles & Huberman, 1994). Because of the great heterogeneity of study 
designs, populations, and measures, we did not perform a meta-analysis.
The 97 papers included in this review represented 82 parent studies. This analysis focused 
on individual papers, rather than parent studies, because papers examined different research 
questions, outcomes, or sub-groups, thereby contributing distinct findings despite sometimes 
utilizing a common data set. Key characteristics of the papers are shown in Table 1. 
Although our literature search time frame began in 1980, the sample was largely comprised 
of recently published work (Figure 2). For example, we found no papers that met all

 eligibility criteria that had been published prior to 1990, and the majority (69%) included in 
this review was published in 2010 or later.
 Results
 Racial/Ethnic Discrimination
Seventy-one papers reported findings about racial/ethnic discrimination, making it the most 
frequently studied topic and constituting the majority of papers included in this review. 
Nearly all papers were based in the United States, but one each reported findings from 
Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong, and New Zealand. Studies examined a wide variety of 
outcomes, sometimes reporting multiple findings in a single paper. Alcohol-related 
outcomes included any drinking, hazardous drinking patterns (e.g., binge episodes), negative 
consequences of drinking, and symptoms of dependence. Nearly half of these papers (n=31, 
44%) reported global tests of associations whereas more than half (n=45, 63%) used 
complex analytic strategies (e.g.,mediation, moderation). Six papers included both global 
tests and more complex analyses. Table 2 summarizes findings on racial/ethnic 
discrimination by type of test.
Global tests of association produced considerable inconsistent findings. Of 31 papers 
reporting a global test, 14 (45%) found a positive association, 10 (32%) found no 
association, and seven (23%) had mixed results (i.e., positive association for one outcome or 
exposure but no association for another outcome or exposure). For example, Okamoto and 
colleagues (2009) found that discrimination was associated with 63% higher odds of past 
month drinking among Latino adolescents. In contrast, Tobler and colleagues (2013) found 
no such association in a diverse sample of adolescents. The variability of findings may be a 
function of methods. Most papers were classified as moderate quality (n=16, 52%) or low 
quality (n=10, 32%), due to a reliance on cross-sectional data (n=26, 84%), non-probability 
sampling (n=17, 55%), and lack of an explicit theoretical foundation (n=16, 52%).
The larger body of findings from complex analyses showed not only more consistent 
positive associations, but also contributed further details about mechanisms. In mediational 
analyses, intervening variables were predominantly individual-level factors. For example, 
several studies found that racial/ethnic discrimination was associated with anger, post-
traumatic stress symptoms, and depressive symptoms, which in turn were associated with 
alcohol abuse or dependence (Gray & Montgomery, 2012; Mulia & Zemore, 2012; 
Whitbeck, Chen, Hoyt, & Adams, 2004). As above, few studies examined mediators at 
social-ecological levels beyond the individual level. Among exceptions, peers’ substance use 
and collective historical loss were found to partially explain the relationships between racial/
ethnic discrimination and adolescent substance use and adults’ risk of abuse or dependence, 
respectively (Brody, Kogan, & Chen, 2012; Whitbeck et al., 2004). The majority of papers 
reporting tests of mediation were of moderately good quality (n=10, 77%) due to greater use 
of longitudinal data (n=6, 46%), probability sampling (n=8, 62%), and explicit theoretical 
frameworks (n=6, 46%).
There were numerous tests of conditional relationships; however, it was often unclear how 
moderators were selected. Of 32 papers testing conditional associations, the majority (n=24,

 75%) reported no theoretical framework for the study. Nevertheless, greater proportions of 
this set of papers were classified as high quality (n=6, 19%) or moderately good quality 
(n=19, 59%) due to use of probability sampling (n=19, 59%) and established discrimination 
measures (n=21, 66%). Moderation analyses identified differential effects of discrimination 
and clarified the conditions under which such associations occur. For example, two analyses 
found that the relationship between racial/ethnic discrimination and alcohol abuse or 
dependence varied by level of ethnic identity, such that higher levels of ethnic identity 
appeared to attenuate the association (Chae et al., 2008; L. S. Richman, Boynton, Costanzo, 
& Banas, 2013).
Overall, the scope of these studies was largely local, with most samples drawn from city 
(n=24, 34%) or state/regional (n=26, 37%) populations. More than half of the papers (63%) 
reported findings from a single racial/ethnic group, most often African Americans (n=18) 
and US Latinos (n=17). The majority of studies (n=48, 68%) used an established measure of 
the exposure, most frequently the Everyday Discrimination Scale (Williams, Yan, Jackson, 
& Anderson, 1997), followed by the Schedule of Racist Events (Landrine, Klonoff, Corral, 
Fernandez, & Roesch, 2006), and the Experiences of Discrimination scale (Krieger, Smith, 
Naishadham, Hartman, & Barbeau, 2005). Broad conclusions about racial/ethnic 
discrimination are difficult given the diversity of outcomes, analytic approaches, and 
populations studied; however, the preponderance of evidence supports a positive association, 
with inconsistently detailed evidence for some groups.
 Sexual Orientation Discrimination
The second most frequently studied topic was discrimination due to sexual orientation (i.e., 
homophobia; heterosexism). Of 18 papers identified, the majority (n=15, 83%) was from the 
United States, but the set also included reports from Canada, Mexico, and the United 
Kingdom. As with racial/ethnic discrimination, these papers examined a wide variety of 
alcohol-related outcomes, and three papers contributed multiple findings. Table 3 
summarizes findings on sexual orientation discrimination by type of test.
The majority of papers (n=13, 72%) reported a global test, of which 10 (77%) found no 
association. The remaining three papers reporting a positive association presented 
conflicting evidence. For example, two papers reported a positive association between sexual 
orientation discrimination and any drinking (Gilbert, Perreira, Eng, & Rhodes, 2014; Ortiz-
Hernandez, Tello, & Valdes, 2009), but two additional papers found no such association 
(Rivers, 2004; Rosario, Schrimshaw, & Hunter, 2008). Further, in three papers sexual 
orientation discrimination was associated with hazardous drinking (Hequembourg & 
Dearing, 2013; Lehavot & Simoni, 2011; Weber, 2008); however, four papers found no 
relationship with hazardous drinking (D’Augelli, Grossman, Hershberger, & O’Connell, 
2001; Igartua, Gill, & Montoro, 2003; M.W. Ross et al., 2001; Wong, Kipke, Weiss, & 
McDavitt, 2010).
A minority of papers (n=8, 44%) reported findings from complex analytic models. Of those, 
two studies tested mediators, finding an indirect association through affiliation with deviant 
peers among adolescents (Huebner, Thoma, & Neilands, 2015) or through decreased 
individual psychosocial resources among adult women (Lehavot & Simoni, 2011). It should

 be noted, however, that these analyses combined alcohol use with illicit drug use, thereby 
decreasing precision about alcohol outcomes. A third mediation analysis established that 
discrimination partially explained the association between same-sex attraction or self-
identity as a sexual minority and alcohol use (Ortiz-Hernandez et al., 2009). Five papers 
reported tests of moderation, suggesting complex, conditional relationships that depended on 
gender, age, or depressive symptoms. Indeed, the differential effect of discrimination by 
gender emerged as a minor theme, with two studies finding associations among women but 
not men (Amadio, 2006; Amadio & Chung, 2004), and one finding an association only when 
sexual orientation discrimination was combined with concurrent gender discrimination 
(McCabe, Bostwick, Hughes, West, & Boyd, 2010).
Methodologically, a notable difference was the social-ecological level of the risk exposure. 
Equivalent proportions (n=8, 44%) focused on internalized homophobia and interpersonal 
experiences of discrimination, and a minority (n=2, 11%) measured both aspects of 
discrimination. There was nearly universal use of established measures of discrimination 
(n=17, 94%). Some studies adapted existing measures of racial/ethnic discrimination for use 
with sexual minorities, such as the Schedule of Racist Events (Landrine et al., 2006) or 
Experiences of Discrimination Scale (Krieger & Sidney, 1996). Others utilized measures 
that had been developed specifically to assess internalized discrimination, such as the 
Homosexual Attitudes Inventory (Nungesser, 1983), Lesbian Internalized Homophobia 
Scale (Szymanski & Chung, 2001), and the Reactions to Homosexuality Scale (M. W. Ross 
& Rosser, 1996). Except for one analysis that used longitudinal data, all results were based 
on cross-sectional data. Samples included similar numbers drawn from city/community 
(n=6, 33%), state/regional (n=5, 28%), and national (n=7, 39%) populations; however, few 
samples (n=4, 22%) were obtained via probability sampling methods. Three-quarters of 
analyses (n=13, 72%) had no theoretical or conceptual framework. Given the mix of 
strengths and weaknesses, 65% of the papers were categorized as moderately good quality 
and 29% as low quality.
 Gender Discrimination
Six papers assessed the relationship between gender discrimination (i.e., sexism) and alcohol 
outcomes, making it the smallest body of literature on a single topic. One study was set in 
Canada, and the remainder were based in the US. the majority (n=5, 83%) were recent, 
having been published in 2007 or later. Of this small set of papers, two presented findings 
from global tests of association, two from complex analyses (e.g., mediation, moderation), 
and two from both global test and complex analyses. Table 4 summarizes findings on gender 
discrimination by type of test.
Papers examined a variety of alcohol outcomes, finding largely positive associations. The 
sole null finding was a paper that found no association between past-year or lifetime gender 
discrimination and past-year substance use disorders (McCabe et al., 2010); however, the 
same paper found a positive association when gender discrimination was combined with 
lifetime sexual orientation discrimination. Among other complex analyses, one paper tested 
identified an indirect pathway from gender discrimination to binge drinking through

 increased psychological distress (Zucker & Landry, 2007), and another paper found that the 
association depended on coping (McLaughlin, Hatzenbuehler, & Keyes, 2010).
Equivalent proportions of papers were categorized as low (n=2, 33%), moderately good 
(n=2, 33%), and high (n=2, 33%) quality. Except for one paper using longitudinal data, all 
results were based on cross-sectional data. Samples were drawn from city/community (n=3, 
50%), state/regional (n=1, 17%), and national (n=2, 33%) populations, with the majority 
(n=4, 67%) obtained via non-probability sampling methods. Theory was largely absent from 
the set of papers; only two papers provided an explicit theoretical justification for the 
analysis, citing minority stress models, stress and coping models, and intersectionality 
theory. Another paper implied a basis in a stress and coping framework but did not provide 
any supporting citations. All papers focused on interpersonal gender discrimination, of 
which the majority (n=4, 67%) used an established measure of discrimination, such as the 
Experiences of Discrimination Scale (Krieger et al., 2005), Everyday Discrimination Scale 
(Williams et al., 1997), or the Schedule of Sexist Events (Landrine & Klonoff, 1997).
 Generalized discrimination
A final set of four papers reported findings for generalized discrimination, in which the 
cause of discrimination was either not distinguished or several possible types were 
collapsed. For example, one paper assessed experiences of workplace discrimination 
“because of gender, race or color” (p. 72), thus failing to differentiate its underlying cause 
(Yen, Ragland, Greiner, & Fisher, 1999b). The remaining three papers measured 
discrimination in multiple domains (e.g., race, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, 
among others) but collapsed all types into a single indicator for analysis (Capezza, Zlotnick, 
Kohn, Vicente, & Saldivia, 2012; Coelho, Bastos, & Celeste, 2015; Hatzenbuehler, Corbin, 
& Fromme, 2011). These approaches resulted in decreased detail about the exposure of 
interest. Thus, overarching conclusions are difficult, yet these papers may still contribute 
relevant information. Table 5 summarizes findings on generalized discrimination by type of 
test.
There was one instance of inconsistent findings. One paper found a global positive 
association between generalized discrimination and hazardous drinking (Capezza et al., 
2012) while another paper found no such association; however, the second paper identified a 
global positive association between generalized discrimination and drinking-related 
problems (Yen et al., 1999b). This was consistent with a third paper that found an indirect 
association with drinking-related problems through motivation to drink as a coping strategy 
(Hatzenbuehler et al., 2011). The final paper, testing a conditional model, found that a 
positive association with hazardous drinking only existed for mid-course university students; 
there was no association for either first-or last-year students.
These studies of generalized discrimination were categorized as moderately good (n=3, 
75%) or high quality 9n=1, 25%). All analyses used probability samples drawn from local 
populations (i.e., single metropolitan areas), two in the US, one in Chile, and one in Brazil. 
In all cases, discrimination was measured at the interpersonal level, with two studies using 
established instruments. Only one study provided a theoretical justification for its analysis.

  Other Types of Discrimination
Few studies investigated other types of discrimination in relation to alcohol use. For 
example, we found no studies that examined discrimination due to religion or disability 
status. One paper reported an analysis of discrimination due to age or physical appearance 
using a subset of US African Americans in the Panel Study on Income Dynamics—
Transition to Adulthood Study (Madkour et al., 2015); however, results found no association 
between either type of discrimination and the study’s main outcome, heavy episodic 
drinking. Another paper looked at ageist attitudes and behaviors among college students at a 
single US university and their relationship to alcohol use (Popham, Kennison, & Bradley, 
2011). Results showed a conditional relationship by gender, such that both aspects of ageism 
were correlated with drinking frequency and recent binge episodes in young men but not 
young women. As the study sought to understand how ageist attitudes held by young adults 
might shape their own alcohol use, it fails to explain how experiences of age discrimination 
could be associated with drinking among older adults.
 Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of the scientific literature specifically 
devoted to discrimination and alcohol-related outcomes. Although some previous reviews of 
discrimination have included substance use, their utility may be limited as they collapsed 
alcohol and illicit drug use. Given alcohol’s status as a legal, socially acceptable, and widely 
available psychoactive drug, examining it as a distinct set of outcomes is warranted.
The balance of findings reviewed here suggests a positive association. In other words, as 
experiences of discrimination increase, alcohol consumption, drinking-related problems, and 
risk of disorders tend also to increase. As we found much variation in the papers included in 
our review, with some population groups and types of discrimination receiving ample 
attention and others having been studied very little, the evidence base is quite inconsistent. 
Thus, despite generally supportive findings, important gaps remain. Further, the frequent 
findings of conditional relationships suggest that any claims about discrimination and 
alcohol outcomes must be qualified. We conclude that it is no longer appropriate to speak 
broadly of global associations; rather, scientists must specify the group, type and level of 
discrimination, and alcohol outcome when making claims about discrimination and 
drinking.
This review advances knowledge of the social determinants of alcohol misuse by addressing 
a key gap. Although the past three decades have seen steadily increasing interest in 
discrimination as a factor shaping health behaviors and outcomes, we have lacked a 
comprehensive understanding of its effect on alcohol use in the now voluminous literature. 
Indeed, several previous critical and systematic reviews have only modestly advanced our 
understanding because they failed to distinguish hazardous drinking from any drinking or 
combined alcohol with other substance use. This review provides a focused report of 
findings about alcohol use. Further, it may serve as a guide to inform future research. For 
example, we envision researchers using the detailed tables as evidence guides about specific 
outcomes and groups as they prepare future research projects.

 We found that the largest proportion of papers was devoted to interpersonal experiences of 
racial discrimination among African Americans. This is not unexpected given that the 
majority of papers included in this review were based in the United States and that racism 
has had a prominent place in American social science research since the civil rights 
movement of the 1960s. Although the literature appears mature, especially considering the 
frequent use of complex mediated or moderated analyses, we note some aspects of it that are 
underdeveloped. For example, some racial/ethnic groups have received relatively little 
attention. It remains unknown whether findings based on African American samples are 
generalizable to Asian and Pacific Islander, Native American, or Latino groups given widely 
different histories and socio-political contexts. With an increasingly diverse society, attention 
must be directed towards other minority groups, either in group-specific studies or 
disaggregated analyses of large, diverse samples. Further, studies have relied almost 
exclusively on measures of interpersonal experiences. The contributions of internalized and 
systemic/structural racial/ethnic discrimination have yet to be unexplored.
In contrast to racial/ethnic discrimination, studies of sexual orientation discrimination, 
which constitute the second most frequently studied topic, present an example of a broader 
conceptualization of the risk exposure. Among papers reviewed, we found equivalent 
attention to internalized discrimination as well as interpersonal experiences. Moreover, a 
very high proportion of studies used established measures of discrimination, which improves 
the comparability of findings across studies. Despite these advantages, the sexual orientation 
discrimination literature suffers from important limitations. For example, the overwhelming 
majority of findings were based on cross-sectional data obtained from non-probability 
samples of limited scope. This substantially weakens our ability to make inferences, not only 
precluding assessments of causation but also constraining the generalizability of findings. 
Another striking feature is the degree of null findings. As several studies found that gender 
moderates the relationship of sexual orientation discrimination and alcohol outcomes, it 
raises the possibility of differential processes. Indeed, there may be an effect of sexual 
orientation discrimination for women but not men. Further research is needed to assess 
gender-specific associations.
In addition to summarizing findings, this review assessed the methods underlying the 
evidence. We sought not only to determine what is known, but also how it is known. In light 
of both aims, we make several recommendations to strengthen the evidence base. First, we 
advocate for the use of standardized measures of discrimination, which may decrease 
measurement error and increase comparability of findings. A number of multiple-item 
instruments are available. Some, such as the Everyday Discrimination Scale (Williams et al., 
1997), may capture multiple types of discrimination through follow-up questions about 
attribution. Other instruments may have been created to measure one type of discrimination 
but could be adapted to another, as the Schedule of Sexist Events (Landrine & Klonoff, 
1997) was derived from the Schedule of Racist Events (Landrine & Klonoff, 1996). Given 
ample extant resources, the continued use of non-standard and non-validated measures 
cannot be supported. Related to measurement, there is a growing literature that debates the 
utility of focusing on perceptions of discrimination, which requires recognition and 
attribution, versus experiences, which may or may not be labeled as discrimination (Bastos, 
Celeste, Faerstein, & Barros, 2010; Krieger, 2012). As measures based on different

 conceptualization can yield different results, researchers must be explicit about their 
conceptualization and consider how it may shape findings.
Further, we encourage investigation of all possible social-ecological levels of discrimination. 
As noted previously, the literature on sexual orientation discrimination provides an example 
of sustained research on internalized homophobia and heterosexism. While admirable, our 
overall understanding of the many levels of discrimination remains underdeveloped. In 
particular, we encourage studies of systemic/structural discrimination, which may elaborate 
how context shapes differences in population patterns of alcohol use, such as through degree 
of residential segregation or the absence of non-discrimination ordinances. In their 
exploration of structural racism and heart attack, Lukachko and colleagues (2014) provide a 
model of such an approach that may be applicable to alcohol outcomes.
Second, we call for more complex analyses, particularly of mediated and conditional 
associations, for all types of discrimination. This follows our earlier conclusion that it is no 
longer appropriate to speak broadly of global associations. Basic questions have been 
sufficiently addressed; to advance knowledge, we must now identify the processes through 
which discrimination affects alcohol outcomes and the conditions under which risk may be 
exacerbated or attenuated. Doing so may identify leverage points for harm-reduction 
interventions. The literature on racial/ethnic discrimination serves as a model, as it has 
evolved, albeit unevenly, from descriptive studies to analytic research. A number of 
intrapersonal factors have been identified, such as psychological distress and minority group 
identification; however, many more remain to be tested. Here, we caution against following 
brute empiricism. Behavioral theories should guide our selection of potential mediating and 
moderating variables. In return, empirical findings may help refine theoretical models.
Finally, we strongly urge researchers to eschew non-probability sampling. Some literature, 
such as that on sexual orientation discrimination, has been overly reliant on convenience 
samples, which greatly impacted our quality assessments. The recent development of 
sophisticated methodologies, such as respondent-driven sampling (Ramirez-Valles, 
Heckathorn, Vazquez, Diaz, & Campbell, 2005) and time-space sampling (MacKellar, 
Valleroy, Karon, Lemp, & Janssen, 1996), can be used to obtain approximately 
representative samples when no sampling frame is possible. This is particularly important 
for discrimination research as the stigmatized characteristics that create these hidden and 
hard-to-reach populations may also be the basis of discrimination.
Several potential limitations of this review must be considered. Most importantly, we 
restricted the sample to English language papers, which may have constrained our 
conclusions by excluding potentially relevant findings published in other languages. In 
particular, we note the well-developed field of Latin American social medicine, which has 
received scant attention in the English-speaking world (Tajer, 2003; Waitzkin, Iriart, Estrada, 
& Lamadrid, 2001). With its emphasis on social and political determinants of health, Latin 
American social medicine has the potential to contribute relevant findings about 
discrimination. As an exemplar of this approach, we highlight the work of Vázquez 
Pedrouzo (2004), who used a framework of multiple social and structural determinants to 
identify factors contributing to alcohol-related traffic accidents in Uruguay. We look forward

 to a future review of the Spanish and Portuguese language literature (e.g., SciELO and 
LILACS data bases), which may extend the current set of findings. Similarly, we recognize 
that the overwhelming majority of papers were based on research in the United States, which 
may limit the relevance of our findings in other areas. For example, findings about racial 
discrimination among African Americans may not hold for other minority groups or nations. 
As discrimination is a social phenomenon embedded within specific cultural and historical 
contexts, we look forward to research with non-US populations that will provide a fuller 
understanding of the effects of discrimination and may identify generalizable factors. 
Finally, we were unable to include a meta-analysis in this review due to the heterogeneity of 
study designs, measures, outcomes, and populations. While a pooled estimate of the effect of 
discrimination on alcohol use would represent an epidemiological advance, its absence from 
this review does not impede public health. The preponderance of findings provide sufficient 
evidence of the injurious effect of discrimination to motivate risk-reduction initiatives.
In summary, this review finds support for the widely accepted proposition that 
discrimination is associated with heavy and hazardous drinking, but cautions that claims 
about the relationship must be specific rather than general. It highlights the uneven evidence 
base and suggest directions for future research. Attention to this relationship has the 
potential for broad population benefits, as both discrimination and alcohol misuse are 
associated with directly and indirectly harmful effects.
