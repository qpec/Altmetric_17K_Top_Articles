The availability of therapeutics to treat pregnancy complications is severely lacking mainly because of the risk
of causing harm to the fetus. As enhancement of placental growth and function can alleviate maternal symp-
toms and improve fetal growth in animal models, we have developed a method for targeted delivery of pay-
loads to the placenta. We show that the tumor-homing peptide sequences CGKRK and iRGD bind selectively to
the placental surface of humans and mice and do not interfere with normal development. Peptide-coated na-
noparticles intravenously injected into pregnant mice accumulated within the mouse placenta, whereas control
nanoparticles exhibited reduced binding and/or fetal transfer. We used targeted liposomes to efficiently deliver
cargoes of carboxyfluorescein and insulin-like growth factor 2 to the mouse placenta; the latter significantly
increased mean placental weight when administered to healthy animals and significantly improved fetal weight
distribution in a well-characterized model of fetal growth restriction. These data provide proof of principle for
targeted delivery of drugs to the placenta and provide a novel platform for the development of placenta-specific
therapeutics.
INTRODUCTION
More than 10% of pregnant women develop serious complications,
such as preeclampsia (PE) and fetal growth restriction (FGR) (1–3),
which result in significant maternofetal morbidity and mortality. The
underlying cause of these conditions is a poorly functioning placenta:
Impaired placental perfusion, reduced surface area, altered cell turn-
over, and diminished nutrient transport capacity are all associated with
impaired fetal growth (4, 5) and often result in iatrogenic preterm de-
livery.Theconsequencesaretwofold:Intheshortterm,prematurebabies
are at high risk of developing respiratory distress syndrome, retinopa-
thy, cerebral palsy, and infections. In the long term, small size at birth is
associated with an increased risk of elevated cardiovascular disease, type
2 diabetes, and adiposity in adulthood (6). Despite this, current treat-
ments for PE and FGR are limited to induction of labor and early
delivery, leading to expensive neonatal intensive care costs and exacer-
bation of adverse health outcomes in affected offspring.
Potential therapeutics have been identified that enhance placental
growth and function, alleviate maternal symptoms, and improve fetal
growth in animal models of pregnancy complications (7–9), yet preg-
nant women are considered to be a high-risk, low-return cohort. As a
consequence, only three new drugs have been licensed for use in preg-
nancy in the last 20 years, two of which are used after delivery (10, 11).
To address this, we have developed a method for synaphic [affinity-
based (12)] drug targeting, as a means of focusing drug action within
the placenta, while minimizing side effects in other maternal and fetal
tissues. This technology was originally developed to facilitate targeted
delivery of chemotherapeutics to tumors and tumor vasculature (12, 13),
which express cell surface antigens that are absent from healthy vessels
and tissues (13, 14). Tumor-specific “receptors” are available to bind
circulating ligands, for example, peptides and antibodies (15, 16); at-
taching a diagnostic or therapeutic payload to these ligands allows the
payload to become concentrated in tumor tissue, thereby improving ef-
ficacy and reducing the off-target exposure of normal tissues. For exam-
ple, the pentapeptide CGKRK (Cys-Gly-Lys-Arg-Lys) targets tumor
neovasculature in mouse models of epidermal carcinogenesis (17), glio-
blastoma (18), andbreastcancer(19), andthe cyclic peptide iRGD(Cys-
Arg-Gly-Asp-Lys-Gly-Pro-Asp-Cys) has been used to deliver Abraxane
to tumor vessels in several xenograft models (20).
The villous placenta shares common physiological and biochemical
features with solid tumors, including the ability to undergo rapid pro-
liferation, to produce a variety of growth factors and cytokines, and to
evade immune surveillance (21). Furthermore, a distinct population of
extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells displays behavior similar to that ex-
hibited by metastatic cells: In early pregnancy, EVT cells egress from
placental villi, invade the uterine wall, and remodel the uterine spiral
arteries (22). Because the placenta behaves like a well-controlled tumor,
we hypothesized that existing tumor-homing sequences would bind to
antigens selectively expressed on the placental surface. Here, we dem-
onstrate that tumor-homing peptides can be exploited for targeted de-
livery of payloads to the placenta in mice and humans. We envision that
this technology could be clinically used to provide the first treatments

RESULTS
Tumor-homing peptides bind to epitopes expressed at the
murine maternofetal interface
To examine whether selected tumor-homing peptides could be
exploited for placental targeting, we intravenously injected T7 bacterio-
phage displaying the surface peptide CGKRK or CRGDKGPDC
(iRGD) into pregnant mice. Quantification of phage titers showed
significant enrichment in placental tissue compared to other organs
(Fig. 1A). Next, we synthesized the individual peptides, labeled them
with 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (FAM), and intravenously injected them
into pregnant mice. Histological analysis showed that both FAM-
CGKRK and FAM-iRGD bound to the labyrinth (the region of nutrient
exchange) and to the decidual spiral arteries (the maternal component
of the placenta), but not to the junctional zone (the endocrine compo-
nent of the placenta) adjacent to the labyrinth, at multiple time points in
gestation (Fig. 1, B to G). The peptides did not accumulate in the vas-
cular beds of other major organs but were excreted via the kidney (fig.
S1). The previously characterized control peptide FAM-ARALPSQRSR
(FAM-ARA) did not target the maternofetal interface (Fig. 1, H to J).
Immunostaining with antibodies to the trophoblast marker cytokeratin-
7, the vascular endothelial marker MECA, the junctional zone marker
trophoblast-specific protein a (Tpbpa), and the labyrinthine markers
cathepsin Q (Ctsq) and glial cells missing (GCM-1) revealed that
FAM-CGKRK colocalizedwiththeendotheliumof unremodeleddecid-
ual spiral arteries and also with endovascular trophoblast lining remod-
eled vessel segments (figs. S2, A and B, and S3A). FAM-iRGD showed a
similar binding pattern (figs. S2, C and D, and S3E). FAM-CGKRK
and FAM-iRGD also bound to vascular endothelial cells and tropho-
blast cells within the labyrinth (figs. S2, E and F, and S3, B, C, F, and G).
Repeated administration of CGKRK or iRGD during pregnancy
does not adversely affect pregnancy outcome in mice
To determine whether peptide binding interfered with normal placen-
tal function or was affected upon reproductive outcome, we injected
pregnant mice with vehicle [phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)] or pep-
tide (100 mg per mouse) on embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5), E13.5, and
E15.5. Fetuses and placentas were collected and weighed on E18.5.
Intravenous administration of peptide had no effect on litter size,
number of resorptions, fetal weight, placental weight, or maternal
weight gain (Fig. 2); however, iRGD modestly increased fetal to pla-
cental weight ratio (P < 0.01; Fig. 2E). Treatment did not alter rates of
proliferation or apoptosis in the mouse placenta at E18.5, as measured
by Ki67 and active caspase-3 immunostaining, respectively (fig. S4).
Tumor-homing peptides accumulate within the
syncytiotrophoblast layer of human placental explants
To assess whether FAM-CGKRK and FAM-iRGD bind to the surface of
human placenta, we incubated explants of human first-trimester or
term placental tissue with peptide for up to 24 hours. FAM-CGKRK
rapidly accumulated within the outer syncytiotrophoblast (STB) layer
of first-trimester placenta and was retained within the STB, rather than
penetrating into the underlying cytotrophoblast (CTB) layer (Fig. 3A).
Fluorescence within the villous stroma was noted occasionally but
correlated with loss of the overlying STB. Following a 24-hour
pulse-chase experiment, FAM-CGKRK was still evident within the
STB. Similar data were obtained when FAM-CGKRK was cultured with
term placental explants (Fig. 3B). Fluorescence colocalized with the
trophoblast marker cytokeratin-7 (fig. S5, A and B).
Uptake of FAM-iRGD into the STB of first-trimester placenta
followed different kinetics: Fluorescence was only detected after 30 min
of incubation, although FAM-iRGD continued to accumulate within
the STB layer after this time (Fig. 3C). Similar data were obtained
when FAM-iRGD was cultured with term placental explants (Fig. 3D).
Again, FAM-iRGD was only observed in the underlying tissue when the
STB layer was damaged or lost, and fluorescence colocalized with
cytokeratin-7 immunostaining (fig. S5, C and D). In contrast to FAM-
CGKRK, minimal fluorescence was evident after 24 hours. FAM-ARA
didnotbindtothesyncytiumofhumanplacentaortoothercellularcom-
ponents (Fig. 3, E and F). To ensure that peptide binding did not alter
trophoblast cell turnover, we incubated human first-trimester placental
explantswithvehicleorpeptideforupto48hours.TreatmentwithCGKRK
or iRGD did not alter basal rates of CTB proliferation (Fig. 3G), but iRGD
treatment modestly reduced the rate of CTB apoptosis (P < 0.05; Fig. 3H).
Membrane-associated calreticulin is a receptor for CGKRK
Previous studies have identified av integrins as the receptors for iRGD
in tumors (20); in keeping with this, FAM-iRGD colocalized with integ-
rin av in the mouse placenta (fig. S6). We also identified calreticulin as a
receptor for CGKRK on the placental surface: We applied mouse pla-
cental homogenates to an affinity chromatography column containing
immobilized CGKRK peptide, eluted bound proteins by adding excess
CGKRK, and identified them by matrix-assisted laser desorption/
ionization–time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The elu-
ates contained peptide fragments from several proteins, of which calre-
ticulin was the most abundant (Table 1). Western blotting confirmed
the presence of calreticulin in the eluate (Fig. 4A). The other proteins
predicted by mass spectrometry were not detected in the eluate and so
were not investigated further. Calreticulin is highly expressed in the lab-
yrinth, junctional zone, and spiral arteries of the mouse placenta (Fig. 4,
B to D) and in the syncytium of human first-trimester and term placen-
ta (Fig. 4, E to G). Moreover, FAM-CGKRK bound to recombinant hu-
man calreticulin (Fig. 4H; estimated binding affinity of Kd = 0.59 mM),
and a 50% decrease in calreticulin mRNA expression following small
interfering RNA (siRNA) treatment of term placental explants (fig.
S7) correlated with a similar decrease in FAM-CGKRK binding (siRNA
1, 58.6 ± 6.9%; siRNA 2, 56.7 ± 10.3%; Fig. 4I). Calreticulin colocalized
in the STB of human term placental explants with FAM-CGKRK bind-
ing sites (Fig. 4J), and localization of calreticulin to the placental mi-
crovillous membrane (MVM) was confirmed by flow cytometry of an
MVM-derived vesicle preparation (Fig. 4K). FAM-CGKRK binding to
MVM vesicles was reduced to 59.5 ± 3.3% of control values in the pres-
ence of recombinant human calreticulin (Fig. 4L). These data identify
membrane-associated calreticulin as a placental receptor for CGKRK.
Tumor-homing peptides facilitate targeted delivery of iron oxide
nanoworms to the mouse placenta
To ensure that the peptides retained their function when attached to a
nanoparticle, we coated iron oxide nanoparticles [approximately 180 nm
in length; dubbed nanoworms because of their elongated shape (23)]
with FAM-CGKRK, FAM-iRGD, or FAM-ARA and intravenously
injectedtheminto pregnant mice. Nanoworms coated withFAM-CGKRK

 or FAM-iRGD accumulated at the maternofetal interface (Fig. 5, A to F),
whereas nanoworms coated with the control peptide FAM-ARA did
not (Fig. 5, G to I). As observed with the soluble peptides, nanoworms
bound to the endothelium of the uterine spiral arteries and accumulated
within the placental labyrinth. FAM-CGKRK and FAM-iRGD nano-
worms were observed in some areas of the liver and spleen as previously
described (24), but they did not accumulate in other major organs;
FAM-ARA nanoworms were observed in high numbers throughout
the liver and spleen (fig. S8). These data show that the targeting proper-
ties of the peptides are retained when they are attached to nanoparticles.
Tumor-homing peptides facilitate targeted delivery of
peptide-decorated liposomes to the mouse placenta

theplacenta,wesynthesizedliposomesdecoratedwithTAMRA-CGKRK,
rhodamine-iRGD,orTAMRA-ARA(Fig.6A;Z-averagediameter:CGKRK,
156 nm; iRGD, 146 nm; and ARA, 142 nm), loaded them with the fluores-
cent drug analog carboxyfluorescein (CF; 100 mM), and intravenously
injected them into pregnant mice. Targeted liposomes accumulated at
the maternofetal interface and discrete areas of green fluorescence in-
dicative of CF release were observed after 24 hours. CGKRK-decorated
liposomes predominantly accumulated in the labyrinth, whereas iRGD-
decorated liposomes were also observed within the spiral arteries (Fig. 6,
B to G). With the exception of the liver and spleen, which nonselectively
take up all nanoparticles (24), targeted liposomes were not observed in
other major organs (fig. S9, A and B); pink-colored urine also indicated
peptide excretion via the kidney (fig. S9C), as previously described
(18, 24). After 72 hours, targeted liposomes were still observed within
the placenta (Fig. 6), but the amount present in maternal clearance
organs was markedly reduced (fig. S10). ARA-decorated liposomes
modestly accumulated in the decidua and in the labyrinth (Fig. 6, H to
J), but were also observed at high levels in the maternal lung, the maternal
clearance organs, and fetal tissues from 6 to 72 hours (fig. S11). The CF
cargo of liposomes lacking a targeting peptide (and therefore a peptide-
conjugated red fluorophore) was observed in the liver from 6 to 72 hours,
the spleen at 24 hours, and the fetus from 24 to 72 hours (fig. S12).

 We also incubated peptide-decorated liposomes with human term
placental explants to examine binding and uptake in human tissue. Tar-
geted liposomes facilitated delivery of CF to the syncytium of placental
explants ex vivo; however, delivery was not achieved when ARA-
decorated liposomes were used (Fig. 6, K to M).
Targeted delivery of insulin-like growth factor 2 increases
placental weight in the C57BL/6J mouse
Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) is a critical mediator of placental
growth in both mice and humans(25, 26),but the IGF receptorsare ubiq-
uitously expressed in maternal and fetal tissues. Thus, we selected IGF-2
as an ideal candidate therapeutic to be administered systemically via tar-
geted liposomes. We hypothesized that targeted delivery of IGF-2 to the
placenta would enhance placental growth, translating into increased pla-
cental weights at E18.5 and leading to a corresponding increase in fetal
weight. Healthy pregnant mice were injected with four doses of vehicle
(PBS) and systemically administered IGF-2, empty liposomes, or lipo-
somes containing IGF-2, and fetuses and placentas were harvested on
E18.5. IGF-2 administered in iRGD-decorated liposomes significantly
increasedplacentalweightscomparedtomiceinjectedwithemptyliposomes
decorated with iRGD or ARA or mice injected with PBS alone (Fig. 7A).
Delivery of IGF-2 in iRGD-decorated liposomes was more effective in
increasing placental weights than delivery of IGF-2 in plain or nontargeted
liposomesorviaintravenousinjectionoffreeIGF-2.Inaddition,fewerofthe
smaller(lighter)placentas were observed after treatment with iRGD lipo-
somes containing IGF-2 compared to all other control groups, suggest-
ing that growth of the smallest placentas was enhanced, whereas larger
placentas were unaffected. Despite this, increased placental weight did
not correlate with increased fetal weight; fetal weight was significantly
increased by plain liposomes but not by any other treatment (Fig. 7B).
Mean litter size and number of resorptions were not altered by any
treatment, suggesting that liposomes are well tolerated in pregnancy
(fig. S13, A and B); maternal kidney and spleen weights were similarly
unaffected, suggesting minimal off-target accumulation of IGF-2 in the
clearance organs (fig. S13, C and D). Because empty CGKRK–decorated
liposomes reduced fetal weight compared to treatment with plain lipo-
somes or PBS, this nanocarrier was not used for IGF-2 delivery (Fig. 7B).
Targeted delivery of IGF-2 improves fetal weight
distribution in the P0 mouse model of FGR
Because increased placental growth did not translate into increased fetal
growth in healthy wild-type mice, we tested our targeted liposomes in a
mouse model of FGR, the placenta-specific (P0) Igf-2 knockout mouse.
Males heterozygous for the deletion of the P0 transcript are mated with
C57BL/6J females, producing mixed litters of healthy wild-type and
growth-restricted P0 pups. Placental weights of P0 pups are reduced
at E12 and remain smaller throughout gestation (68% wild-type weight
at E19); however, P0 fetuses are only growth-restricted in late gestation
(96% wild-type weight at E16, 78% wild-type weight at E19, and 69%
wild-type weight at birth) (25). Pregnant mice were injected with vehi-
cle, free IGF-2, or iRGD-decorated liposomes containing IGF-2. Unlike
in C57BL/6J mice, targeted delivery of IGF-2 did not significantly in-
crease placental weight in wild-type or P0 pups (Fig. 8A). Similarly, tar-
geted delivery of IGF-2 did not significantly increase fetal weight (Fig. 8B)
or alter fetal weight distribution in wild-type pups (Fig. 8C). However,
targeted liposomes containing IGF-2 significantly increased fetal weight
of P0 fetuses (83% wild-type weight) and significantly altered fetal weight
distribution, with fewer of the smallest (lowest weight) pups being ob-
served (Fig. 8C), a clinically relevant outcome. Moreover, litter size and
number of resorptions were unaffected by treatment (fig. S14, A and B),
suggesting that the growth of the smallest P0 fetuses was enhanced, with-
out any pregnancy losses occurring; this phenomenon has been observed
in the eNOS−/− mouse model of FGR, following systemic administration
of Leu27 IGF-2 (27). As observed in wild-type mice, maternal spleen and
kidney weights were unaffected by treatment (fig. S14, C and D).
DISCUSSION
Currently, there are no therapeutics available to treat a poorly func-
tioning placenta and alleviate the resulting maternal and fetal symptoms.
Here, we demonstrate that the specific tumor-homing peptide se-
quences CGKRK and iRGD bind to the surface of mouse and human
placental tissue and can be exploited for targeted delivery of payloads to
the placenta. We observed that soluble peptides and peptide-decorated
nanoparticles bound to murine decidual spiral arteries and to the vas-
culature of the placental labyrinth at multiple time points in gestation.
CGKRK and iRGD also bound to the surface of human placental ex-
plants, acting as effective cell-penetrating peptides, which rapidly accu-
mulate in the outer syncytial layer. Similarly, targeted liposomes were
internalized by the syncytium of placental explants, and release of their
CF cargo was observed. Finally, iRGD-decorated liposomes were used
to selectively deliver IGF-2 to mouse placenta, resulting in enhancement
of placental growth in healthy mice and an improved fetal weight dis-
tribution in growth-restricted mice. Given the current drug drought in
obstetrics, a targeted therapy that promotes the growth of the smallest
babies without inducing overgrowth of those that are developing op-
timally fulfills an important clinical need that is currently unmet.
Targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics using iron oxide nano-
worms has been shown to maximize drug efficacy in tumor models
(18). As proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrated that peptide-
decoratednanoworms effectively target the mouse placenta, although this

 form of nanocarrier is unlikely to be compatible with optimal placental
function. Systemic administration of silica or titanium oxide nano-
particles to pregnant mice has been shown to induce structural and
functional changes in the placenta and impair fetal growth (28); thus,
we created peptide-decorated liposomes as our biocompatible nano-
carrier of choice. Candidate payloads would include compounds that
improved placental function and enhanced pregnancy outcome by
modulating cellulargrowthpathways, maternofetalorfetoplacentalvas-
cularphysiology,orlocaloxidativestress,butwouldrequiretissue-specific
delivery. For example, systemic administration of sildenafil citrate nor-
malizes uteroplacental blood flow and promotes fetal growth in mouse
models of PE and FGR (9, 29), but also reportedly has detrimental effects
in fetal vascular function (30). Similarly, IGF-2, a key mediator of pla-
cental growth (25, 26), increases fetal and placental weights and promotes
fetal survival in guinea pigs (31), but if freely administered, it can interact
with ubiquitously expressed IGF receptors in all maternal tissues. Here,
we observed enhanced placental and fetal growth in healthy mice and
mice exhibiting FGR, respectively, following targeted delivery of IGF-2,
demonstrating that our engineered nanoparticles are well tolerated and
can elicit tissue-specific benefits in pregnancy, and that the encapsulated
IGF-2 remained bioactive. Previously, we have delineated growth
signaling pathways in the placenta downstream of IGF stimulation of
the outer STB layer (26). Thus, the syncytial-specific nature of targeting
we observed in human placental tissue suggests that targeted liposomes
willfacilitate delivery oftherapeuticsdirectly tothe trophoblast,providing
the opportunity to modulate its function as a means of enhancing placen-
tal efficiency and improving maternal and fetal outcomes.
In tumors, av integrins are the receptors for the iRGD-homing se-
quence (20); these are adhesion molecules that mediate extracellular ma-
trix attachment and cell signaling. Integrin av is constitutively expressed
within the mouse placenta throughout gestation (32), and we demon-
strate here that FAM-iRGD colocalizes with integrin av–expressing cells
at the maternofetal interface. Integrin avb3 is expressed on the human
placental surface (33) and by invasive EVT cells that colonize the maternal
spiral arteries (34). p32 has recently been identified as the main cell surface
receptor for CGKRK in tumors (19, 35) and is highly expressed in the

 human placenta (36); however, our data identify calreticulin as a pu-
tative receptor on the placental surface. We did not identify p32 in our
mouse placental chromatography eluents, by either mass spectrome-
try or immunoblotting, and we could not detect p32 expression on the
surface of human placental MVM vesicles (fig. S7E). Calreticulin, orig-
inally identified as a calcium-binding protein in the endoplasmic re-
ticulum that regulates intracellular calcium homeostasis (37), also acts
as a molecular chaperone (38), modulates cell adhesion (39), and pro-
motes anticancer immune responses (40, 41). Calreticulin binds the
synthetic peptide KLGFFKR (42), which, like CGKRK, has basic
amino acid residues at the C terminus. Increased calreticulin expression
enhances proliferation, migration, and extracellular matrix degradation
in cancer cells (43), behaviors that are common to some human and
mouse trophoblast lineages. Because total calreticulin protein expres-
sion is reportedly increased in preeclamptic placentas (44), CGKRK-
mediatedtargeting may representanovelmeansof deliveringtherapeutics
to the poorly functioning placenta; however, the decrease in fetal weight
observed following treatment with empty CGKRK–decorated liposomes
will require further investigation.
The biological consequences of administering homing peptides to
healthy organs and tissues have not previously been assessed; this proof-
of-concept study did not detect any detrimental effect of targeting peptides
on pregnancy outcome in mice, and no evidence of fetal transfer of targeted
peptides or targeted liposomes was observed. Furthermore, IGF-2 en-
capsulated in iRGD-decorated liposomes did not increase the weight of
the maternal kidney or spleen, providing evidence of the transient passage
of these targeted nanoparticles through the clearance organs. In human
tissue, extended culture of targeting peptides with placental explants had
no detrimental effect on trophoblast proliferation or apoptosis, suggesting
that they do not interfere with normal placental function at the dose tested.
Technologies that can target therapeutics directly to their site of action,
minimizing interactions with other tissues, will circumvent the risks and
side effects potentially associated with systemic administration of drugs
in human pregnancy and should expedite translation of new treatments
into the clinic. To achieve this, further research and development will be
required, including optimization of liposomal formulation, drug en-
capsulation protocols, and dosing regimens to maximize drug delivery,
combined with toxicity testing in appropriate animal models. Beyond this,
we foresee a scenario where the safety and specificity of targeting could be
tested by administering empty liposomes before pregnancy termination,
followed by evaluation of drug-loaded liposomes in a cohort of women
with severe FGR and a high risk of poor pregnancy outcome. Although
we recognize that our technology may have detrimental off-target effects
in women with undiagnosed malignancies, we believe that the benefits
would greatly outweigh the possible risks, and a screening program before
treatment could be implemented. In summary, our technology, for which
we provide proof-of-principle results using IGF-2–containing liposomes
targeted with iRGD, will provide a platform to develop the first genera-
tion of placenta-specific therapeutics, whichwillrepresent the first treat-
ment options for serious pregnancy complications whose causes are
rooted in suboptimal placental function, such as PE and FGR.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The objective of this study was to create a biocompatible nanoparticle
for targeted delivery of therapeutics to the placenta. Previously de-
scribed tumor-homing sequences were screened for their ability to se-
lectively accumulate in the mouse placenta in vivo; quantitation of
placental enrichment was assessed by phage display. Peptide-decorated
nanoworms and liposomes were synthesized, and their ability to selec-
tively target the mouse placenta was assessed by fluorescence microsco-
py. These in vivo screening experiments were undertaken using three to
four mice per group, and a minimum of three randomly selected
placentas from each mouse were examined. For preclinical studies, each
experimental group included 8 to 10 mice per group, based on previous
studies undertaken in the Maternal and Fetal Health Research Centre,
and was sufficient to determine statistically significant differences in fe-
tal and placental weights. Animals were randomly assigned to experi-
mental groups, studies were not blinded, and the endpoint was term
pregnancy (E18.5). Fetal/placental weights from resorbing conceptuses
were the only data excluded from the study. Ex vivo binding of peptides
and liposomes to human placental explants and immunostaining of
mouse placental tissue were assessed by examining a minimum of three
randomly selected tissue sections from each of the three randomly
sampled tissue explants or randomly selected mouse placentas obtained
from three to four individual human placentas/animals per group. The
receptor for CGKRK was captured using affinity chromatography and
identified using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. In vitro studies of
calreticulin-CGKRK interactions were performed a minimum of n =
3 times.
Animal procedures
BALB/c mice (Charles River), C57BL/6J mice, and placenta-specific P0
knockout mice (P0 mice) with deletion of the U2 exon within the Igf2
gene were housed, and all procedures were performed according to pro-
cedures approved by the Animal Research Committees at University of
California, Santa Barbara, or in accordance with the UK Animals (Sci-
entific Procedures) Act 1986 at the University of Manchester. Animals
had free access to food and water and were maintained on a 12-hour
light/12-hour dark cycle at 21° to 23°C. Following mating, the pres-
ence of a copulation plug was denoted as embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5)
of pregnancy. P0 mice were originally a gift from M. Constância (Bab-
raham Institute, UK). Heterozygous males with the P0 deletion were
mated with C57BL/6J female mice (wild type; 6 to 10 weeks of age,
which resulted in mixed litters consisting of both wild-type and P0
fetuses) (25).
Phage homing
The T7-select phage display system (EMD Biosciences) was used to
construct peptide phage libraries. Individual phages were cloned
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, as previously described
(45, 46). Amplified phages were purified from bacterial lysate by pre-
cipitation with PEG-8000 (Sigma-Aldrich), cesium chloride gradient
ultracentrifugation, and dialysis. The identity of the displayed pep-
tides was confirmed by sequencing of the insert-containing region at
the C terminus of the T7 major coat protein gp10 (Eton Bioscience).
To test homing of individual phage clones in vivo, 1 × 1010 phage in
PBS were intravenously injected via the tail vein. Terminal cardiac
perfusion was performed after 30 min to remove unbound phage;
major organs were harvested, weighed, and homogenized in LB bacte-
rial growth medium containing 1% (v/v) NP-40. Phage titers (wet tissue
mass-1) were determined, and the data were expressed as fold enrich-
ment in comparison to the titerof the control phage G7 (displaying the
surface peptide GGGGGGG) in the same tissue (45, 46).

 Peptide synthesis
Peptides were synthesized in-house at the University of California, San-
ta Barbara, using Fmoc chemistry in a solid-phase synthesizer and pur-
ified by high-performance liquid chromatography, and their sequence
and structures were confirmed by mass spectrometry as previously de-
scribed (45) or were purchased from Insight Biotechnology.
Peptide targeting
Individual synthetic peptides (200 mg) labeled with FAM were
administered via tail vein injection to pregnant BALB/c mice (E11.5
to E17.5) and allowed to circulate for 3 hours. Following terminal car-
diac perfusion with PBS to remove unbound peptide, tissues were collected
for analysis. Organs were snap-frozen or fixed in paraformaldehyde
[4%(w/v)inPBS;overnight],cryoprotectedinsucrosesolution[30%(w/v)
in PBS; 24 hours], embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT;
Sakura), and stored at −80°C. Tissue sections (8 mm) were fixed in ice-
cold methanol (15 min), washed in PBS (2×; 5 min), mounted in Vecta-
shield mounting medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories), and
examined on an Olympus Fluoview 500 confocal microscope (Olympus
America). Images were captured at the same exposure so that compar-
isons across samples could be made.
Peptide treatment study
BALB/c mice were intravenously injected with vehicle (PBS), Ac-iRGD,
or Ac-CGKRK (100 mg) on E11.5, E13.5, and E15.5 of pregnancy. Mice
were sacrificed at E18.5, and the following parameters were measured:
littersize,resorptionnumber,fetalweight,placentalweight,fetal/placental
weight ratio, and percent increase in maternal body weight from E10.5
to E18.5. The number of animals required to observe a statistically sig-
nificant change in fetal and/or placental weight following treatment (n =
8 to 10 mice per group) was determined by a power calculation per-
formed using data from previous treament studies. Placentas were fixed
in paraformaldehyde [4% (w/v) in PBS; overnight], dehydrated in su-
crose solution [30% (w/v) in PBS; 24 hours], then embedded in OCT,
and stored at −80°C.
Peptide-conjugated nanoworms
Peptide-conjugated iron oxide nanoworms were prepared as previously
described (23, 24, 47). Nanoworms (5 mg of iron/kg maternal body
weight) were intravenously injected into pregnant BALB/c mice (E12.5
to E15.5; n = 3 per nanoworm formulation) and allowed to circulate
for 5 hours. After cardiac perfusion with PBS to remove unbound nano-
worms, organs were harvested, snap-frozen, and stored at −80°C. Tissue
sections (8 mm) were fixed in ice-cold methanol (15 min), washed in
PBS(2×; 5min), mountedin Vectashieldmounting mediumcontaining
DAPI, and examined on an Olympus Fluoview 500 confocal micro-
scope. Images were captured at the same exposure so that comparisons
across samples could be made.
Liposome preparation
Liposomes were prepared using the thin lipid film process. The constit-
uent lipids were as follows: 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DSPC; 32.5 mM), 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-
N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000] ammonium salt [DSPE-PEG(200);
1.875 mM], 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-
[maleimide(polyethylene glycol)-2000] ammonium salt [DSPE-PEG(2000)-
maleimide; 0.625 mM; Avanti Polar Lipids], and cholesterol (15 mM;
Sigma-Aldrich). These were dissolved in approximately 10 ml of chlo-
roform (Sigma-Aldrich) in a round-bottom flask. The chloroform was
removed by rotary evaporation (40°C, 270 mbar) to form a lipid film
and incubated in a vacuum oven drier overnight at room temperature.
The film was rehydrated in 1 ml of PBS containing FAM [CF, 2.5 mM;
Sigma-Aldrich; reconstituted first in 0.1% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide] or
IGF-2 (40 mM; GroPep; maximal dose of 1 mg/kg in 100 ml of liposomes,
if 100% encapsulation was attained; IGF-2 was reconstituted first in
10 mM HCl), and the resulting suspension was vortexed (10 to 15 min),
heated at 45°C for a minimum of 2 hours, and extruded through a 1-ml-
size thermobarrel Mini-Extruder (100-nm-pore polycarbonate mem-
branes; Avanti Polar Lipids) a minimum of 11 times to produce a
monodisperse liposome preparation containing encapsulated CF or
IGF-2.
To prepare targeted liposomes, peptides bearing an N-terminal cys-
teine moiety [TAMRA-CGGGCGKRK (CGKRK); rhodamine-
CCRGDKGPDC(iRGD);1.25mM;InsightBiotechnology]wereincubated
withextrudedliposomesforaminimumof4hoursatroomtemperatureto
facilitate conjugation of free thiol groups on the cysteine residues to mal-
eimide groups on the liposomal surface via a Michael-type addition reac-
tion. The nontargeting peptide sequence TAMRA-ARA was conjugated
totheliposomesurfaceinasimilarmannerto produce controlliposomes.
Because of the cyclic structure of iRGD, rhodamine was used instead of
TAMRA for ease of synthesis; both fluorophores have similar molecular
weights (rhodamine, 479 daltons; TAMRA, 527.5 daltons), and this sub-
stitution did not affect the selectivity of peptide targeting.
To remove unbound peptide or unencapsulated CF, liposomes were
dialyzed against PBS (8×, 500 ml; 24 hours) in Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis
cassettes with a molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of 3.5 kD (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). To remove unencapsulated IGF-2 from the prepara-
tions, liposomes were dialyzed in cassettes with a 10-kD MWCO. The
liposomes were stored at 4°C; Z-average sizes were calculated from the
size distributions measured by dynamic light scattering at 25°C (Zeta-
sizer Nano ZS).
Liposome targeting
Control or targeted liposomes (100 ml) were administered via tail vein
injection to pregnant C57BL/6J mice at E12.5 and allowed to circulate
for 24, 48, or 72 hours (n = 3 per group). Following terminal cardiac
perfusion with PBS, tissues were collected for analysis. Organs were
fixed in paraformaldehyde [4% (w/v) in PBS; overnight], embedded
in OCT (Sakura), and stored at −80°C. Tissue sections (10 mm) were
fixed in paraformaldehyde [4% (w/v) in PBS; 15 min], washed in PBS
(2×; 5 min), mounted in Vectashield mounting medium containing
DAPI (Vector Laboratories), and examined on a Zeiss Axio Observer
fluorescence microscope. Images were captured at the same exposure so
that comparisons across samples could be made.
Liposome treatment study
Pregnant C57BL/6J mice were intravenously injected with 100 ml of ve-
hicle (PBS); plain (undecorated) liposomes; empty ARA–, iRGD-, or
KRK-decorated liposomes; free IGF-2 (1 mg/kg maternal body weight)
or plain liposomes; ARA liposomes; or iRGD liposomes containing
IGF-2 (approximately 0.3 mg/kg maternal body weight) on E11.5,
E13.5, E15.5, and E17.5 of pregnancy. Pregnant P0 mice followed the
same dosing regime and were intravenously injected with 100 ml of
vehicle (PBS), free IGF-2 (1 mg/kg maternal body weight), or iRGD
liposomes containing IGF-2 (approximately 0.3 mg/kg maternal body
weight). All mice were sacrificed at E18.5, and the following variables

 were measured: fetal weight, placental weight, litter size, number of re-
sorptions, maternal spleen weight, and maternal kidney weight.
The number of animals required to observe a statistically significant
change in fetal and/or placental weight following treatment (n = 8 to 10
mice per group) was determined by a power calculation performed
using data from previous treament studies. Organs were fixed in para-
formaldehyde [4% (w/v) in PBS; overnight], dehydrated in sucrose so-
lution [30% (w/v) in PBS; 24 hours], then embedded in OCT,andstored
at −80°C.
Human tissue
First-trimester placentas were collected following surgical or medical
termination of pregnancy. Term placentas (37 to 42 weeks of gestation)
were obtained from uncomplicated pregnancies within 30 min of vagi-
nal or cesarean delivery. Written informed consent was obtained from
all patients, and the study was performed in accordance with the North
West Local Research Ethics Committee approvals 08/H1010/28 and 08/
H1010/55. Villous tissue was randomly sampled, and biopsies were
washed in serum-free culture medium and dissected into 3-mm3 ex-
plants under sterile conditions. Explants (one per well) were submerged
in 1 ml of culture medium [1:1 ratio of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s me-
dium (DMEM) and Ham’s F12 medium (Lonza Biosciences) contain-
ing glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml),
and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen)] in 24-well culture plates
precoated with agarose [1% (w/v); Sigma-Aldrich]. Explants were main-
tained in 20% O2, 5% CO2 at 37°C for up to 72 hours, as previously de-
scribed (26, 48).
Explant culture
First-trimester placental explants were serum-starved overnight and
then cultured with vehicle (PBS), Ac-CGKRK, or Ac-iRGD (20 mM;
24 to 48 hours; n = 4 independent experiments). After washing in
PBS, tissue was fixed in neutral buffered formalin [4% (v/v), pH 7.4;
overnight], dehydrated, and paraffin-embedded.
Peptide-binding assay
Term villous placental explants (3 mm3) were added to individual
Eppendorf containing prewarmed culture medium [DMEM/Ham’s
F12 medium containing glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (100 IU/ml),
streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum] and
either FAM-CGKRK (20 mM), FAM-iRGD (20 mM), or vehicle con-
trol (PBS). Explants were incubated at 37°C in the dark for up to 3 hours,
washed in PBS (1×; 5 min), fixed in neutral buffered formalin [4% (v/v),
pH 7.4; overnight], and embedded in OCT. Pulse-chase experiments
were also performed: Explants were incubated with FAM-labeled peptide
(20 mM) for 3 hours, washed in PBS (1×; 5 min), placed in fresh culture
medium, and incubated for a further 21 hours before fixation. Tissue
sections (8 mm) were fixed in ice-cold methanol (15 min), washed in PBS
(2×; 5 min), mounted in Vectashield mounting medium containing
DAPI (Vector), and examined on a Zeiss Axio Observer fluorescence
microscope. Images were captured at the same exposure so that compar-
isons across samples could be made. n = 4 independent experiments were
performed.
Liposome-binding assay
Term placental explants were placed in 24-well plates precoated with
agarose [1% (w/v) in DMEM/Ham’s F12 medium containing glutamine
(2 mM), penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and 10% (v/v)
fetal bovine serum]. Explants were incubated with either control or tar-
geted liposomes containing CF (100 ml per well) for 24 hours at 37°C in
the dark. Tissue was washed in PBS (1×; 5min), fixed in neutral buffered
formalin [4% (v/v), pH 7.4; overnight], and embedded in OCT. Sections
were cut, processed, and visualized as described above. n = 3 independent
experiments were performed.
Calreticulin knockdown
siRNA sequences added to the culture medium of human term placen-
tal explants in the absence of transfection reagents or electroporation
spontaneously accumulate in the STB layer (48). Calreticulin knock-
down was achieved by adding siRNA sequences directly to the culture
medium (50 nM; sequence 1, #HSS101319; sequence 2, #HSS188554;
Stealth Select RNAi siRNA, Invitrogen). A nontargeting siRNA was
used as a negative control (#12935300; Invitrogen). Term placental ex-
plants were cultured with vehicle (PBS), nontargeting siRNA, or the
calreticulin-specific siRNA sequences for 72 hours. Efficiency of
knockdown was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. n = 4 independent
experiments were performed.
Quantitative RT-PCR
TotalRNAwasextractedfromplacentalexplants,quantified,andreverse-
transcribed(100ng persample) aspreviouslydescribedusinganAffinity-
Script Multiple Temperature cDNA Synthesis Kit (Agilent) (49).
CalreticulincomplementaryDNA(cDNA)wasamplifiedusingqPCRusing
published primer sequences (forward, 5′-TGGCGTGCTGGGCCT-
GGACCTCTGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCTCTTTGCGTTTCTTGTCTT-
CTTC-3′; Invitrogen) (50) and Ultra-Fast SYBR Green QPCR Master
Mix with 5-carboxy-X-rhodamine as a passive reference dye (Agilent)
in a Stratagene Mx3000P RT-PCR machine. Calreticulin mRNA expres-
sion in triplicate samples was quantified against a standard curve con-
structed with cDNA obtained from human reference total RNA (Agilent).
Calreticulin expression was normalized to the expression of the house-
keeping gene 18S rRNA (forward primer, 5′-GCTGGAATTACCGC-
GGCT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CGGCTACCACATCCAAGGAA-3′).
Saturation-binding assay
Binding of CGKRK to recombinant human calreticulin was quantified as
previously described (35). Microplate wells precoated with calreticulin pro-
tein (3 mg/ml; Stratech) were incubated with increasing concentrations of
FAM-CGKRK in PBS (100 ml per well) for 1 hour at room temperature.
After washing with ice-cold PBS containing 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20 and
0.2MNaCl(5×;5min),fluorescence(excitation,485nm;emission, 538 nm)
was measured using a SpectraMax Gemini XS microplate reader (Molec-
ular Devices). Values were normalized to nonspecific peptide binding,
measured in the absence of calreticulin. n = 4 independent experiments
were performed.
Quantification of peptide binding following
calreticulin knockdown
Following calreticulin knockdown, explants were transferred from
culture plates into individual Eppendorf containing prewarmed culture
medium. Explants were incubated with FAM-CGKRK (20 mM) or ve-
hicle control (PBS) at 37°C in the dark for 30 min, during which time
peptide binding occurred. Explants were washed in PBS (2×; 5 min) and
transferred to fresh tubes containing 1 ml of distilled water (dH2O).
Explants were frozen (−80°C, 30 min) and thawed (37°C, 5 min) to

 promote tissue lysis and peptide release from the syncytium. Tubes
were briefly vortexed, and the explants were removed and blotted to
remove excess liquid. The explants were weighed, and the tubes were
centrifuged (13,250g, 10 min) to pellet residual cell debris. Supernatants
were transferred in triplicate (3×, 200 ml) to a 96-well plate, fluorescence
(excitation, 485 nm; emission, 538 nm) was quantified using a Spectra-
Max Gemini XS microplate reader, and values were normalized to the
wetweightoftheexplant.n=4independentexperimentswereperformed.
Isolation of STB microvillus membrane vesicles
MVM vesicles were prepared from normal human term placenta by
Mg2+ precipitation and differential centrifugation, as previously
described (51). MVM vesicles spontaneously orientate right-side-out,
replicating the extracellular surface of the placenta. Briefly, placental
tissue (350 g) was homogenized with 2.5 volume of ice-cold mannitol
buffer [300 mM mannitol, 1 mM MgSO4, 10 mM Hepes-tris (pH 7.4)].
Following the addition of MgCl2 (10 mM), the homogenate was stirred
(10 min on ice) before centrifugation (2300g, 15 min). The supernatant
was collected and centrifuged (23,500g, 40 min; Sorvall Discovery
100SE), the pellet was resuspended in 2.5 ml of mannitol buffer and then
stirred with MgCl2 (10 mM; 10 min on ice), and the two centrifugation
steps were repeated again. The final pellet was weighed and resuspended
in 6 ml of intravesicular buffer [20 mM sucrose, 5 mM Hepes, 5 mM tris
(pH 7.4)], and membranes were vesiculated by passing 20 times through
a 25-gauge needle. MVM protein concentration was determined by the
Lowry method, and MVM purity was assessed by measuring enrichment
of alkaline phosphatase activity, as previously described (51). Vesicles
were stored at 4°C and used within 48 hours of isolation.
Flow cytometry
To quantify calreticulin expression in the MVM, MVM vesicles suspended
in1mlofPBS(2mgofprotein/ml)wereincubatedwitharabbitanti-human
calreticulin primary antibody (1:100; Abcam), a rabbit anti-human p32
primary antibody (1:200; Sigma-Aldrich), or a rabbit IgG control (Sigma-
Aldrich)for1houratroomtemperatureonarotatingwheel.PBSwasadded
in excess, and MVM vesicles were incubated for a further 15 min. After
centrifugation (23,500g, 40 min; Sorvall Discovery 100SE), the super-
natant was removed, and the vesicles were resuspended in PBS containing
a fluorescein isothiocyanate–conjugated secondary antibody (1:50; Dako).
MVMvesicleswereincubatedfor30minatroomtemperatureon a rotating
wheel, PBS was added in excess, and vesicles were incubated for a further
15 min. MVM vesicles were pelleted by centrifugation (23,500g, 40 min)
and resuspended in PBS, and the extent of antibody binding was quan-
tified using a Beckman Coulter CyAn ADP flow cytometer with Summit
analysis software. MVM vesicles from n = 4 placentas were analyzed.
To quantify FAM-CGKRK binding to the MVM, MVM vesicles sus-
pended in PBS (2 mg of protein; 1-ml final volume) were incubated with
either a control protein (BSA; 10 mg) or recombinant human calreticulin
(10 mg; Stratech)and FAM-CGKRK (20 mM) for 30 min at room tempera-
ture on a rotating wheel. PBS was added in excess, and vesicles were incu-
batedforafurther15min.Vesicleswerecentrifuged(23,500g,40min)and
resuspended in PBS, and the extent of peptide binding was quantified
using a CyAn ADP flow cytometer. MVM vesicles from n = 4 placentas
were analyzed.
Affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry
To identify putative homing peptide receptors, affinity chromatography
and mass spectrometry were performed as previously described (46).
Briefly, mouse placental tissue (E16.5; one placenta from each of three
mice) was snap-frozen and crushed to a powder with a pestle and mor-
tar. Tissue (100 mg/400 ml) was incubated in tissue lysis buffer [ice-cold
PBS containing n-octyl-b-D-glucopyranoside (200 nM; Calbiochem)
and four EDTA-free protease inhibitors cocktail tablets (Roche)] on
a shaker at 4°C for 6 hours. The homogenate was centrifuged
(22,000g, 30 min; 4°C), and the supernatant was retained. CGKRK pep-
tide was coupled to two SulfoLink resin columns (Pierce) according to
themanufacturer’sinstructions,whichwereequilibratedwithcolumnwash
buffer(ice-coldPBScontaining 50nM n-octyl-b-D-glucopyranoside;3×,1-
ml washes). Tissue supernatant (1 ml) was added to the columns and
incubated overnight at 4°C on a rotating shaker. The supernatant was
discarded, and the columns were washed (8×, 4 ml) with column wash
buffer. Bound peptideswere eluted from one column by serial application
of free CGKRK peptide in wash buffer (2 mM peptide; 10×, 0.4-ml elu-
tions). A control peptide (CREKA; 2 mM) was applied to the second col-
umn to detect nonspecific protein binding. Eluted fractions were
collected, analyzed for protein expression, and separated using SDS–
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Bands were visualized
using a SilverSnap SDS-PAGE silver staining kit (Pierce); bands
appearing in elutions from the CGKRK column, but not from the con-
trol peptide column, were excised. Proteins were digested with trypsin,
and the resulting peptides were analyzed using MALDI-TOF mass spec-
trometry. Profound software was used to match peptide data against
known protein sequences.
Immunofluorescence
Tissue sections (8 mm) were fixed in ice-cold methanol (15 min),
washed in PBS (2×; 5 min), and incubated with 5% (w/v) BSA in PBS
for 30 min to block nonspecific binding sites. Primary antibodies [rabbit
anti-cytokeratin, wide spectrum screening (1:50; Z0622, Dako); rat anti-
mouse pan endothelial cell antigen MECA-32 (1:50; sc-19603, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit anti-human calreticulin (1:100; ab2907,
Abcam); rabbit anti-mouse aV integrin (1:100; AB1930, Millipore);
rabbit anti-mouse Ki67 (1:200; ab16667, Abcam); rabbit anti-mouse
cleaved caspase-3 (1:50; #9661, Cell Signaling); rabbit anti-mouse ca-
thepsin Q (1:250; ab171840, Abcam); rabbit anti-mouse GCM-
1 (1:250; sc-98811, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit anti-mouse
Tpbpa (1:500; ab104401, Abcam); isotype control mouse or rabbit
IgG (concentration matched; I8765 and I8140, Sigma-Aldrich);
and control rat IgG (concentration matched; sc-2026, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology)] were diluted in PBS and applied to the tissue sec-
tions. Slides were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature in a hu-
midity chamber. After washing in PBS (3×, 5 min), tissue sections
were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies [anti-
mouse, A11004; anti-rabbit, A1101; or anti-rat, A11077 Alexa Fluor
568 (1:500); Invitrogen] for 1 hour at room temperature. After fur-
ther PBS washes, slides were mounted in Vectashield mounting me-
dium containing DAPI (Vector) and examined using a Zeiss Axio
Observer fluorescence microscope. For each antibody, images were
captured at the same exposure so that comparisons between samples
could be made.
To quantify Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining, three ran-
domimagesoftheplacentallabyrinthandthedeciduawerecaptured,and
the number of immunopositive cells per field was counted by a blinded
observer. These data were used to determine a mean number of positive
cells within the labyrinth and decidua of each placenta. n = 3 placentas
from n = 4 mice per treatment group were examined.

 Immunohistochemistry
Sections of wax-embedded placental explants (5 mm) were deparaffi-
nized in Histo-Clear and alcohol, washed in dH2O, and microwaved
for 10 min in sodium citrate buffer [0.01 M; containing 0.05% (v/v)
Tween 20 (pH 6.0)] to facilitate antigen unmasking. After cooling, en-
dogenous peroxide activity was blocked by incubating the tissue
sections in 3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. Tissue sections were
washed three times in 0.05 M tris-buffered saline (TBS) and incubated
with 5% (w/v) BSA in TBS for 30 min to block nonspecific binding.
Primary antibodies [diluted to the required concentration with 0.05 M
TBS (pH 7.6); mouse anti-human Ki67 (1:200; clone MIB-1,
#M7240, Dako), mouse anti-human M30 CytoDEATH (1:50; #12-
140-322-001, Roche), rabbit anti-human calreticulin (1:100; ab2907,
Abcam), and isotype control mouse or rabbit IgG (concentration
matched; I8765 and I8140, Sigma-Aldrich)] were applied to the tissue
sections, which were incubated overnight at 4°C in a humidity chamber.
Slides were washed (3×, 5 min; TBS), and the secondary antibodies, di-
luted in TBS (biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG, 1:200; Dako), were ap-
plied for 30 min at room temperature. Slides were washed again (3×,
5 min; TBS) and incubated with avidin peroxidase (5 mg/ml in TBS;
Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at room temperature. Slides were washed
in TBSandincubated for 1to 5min with0.05% (w/v) diaminobenzidine
and 0.015% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide (Sigma-Aldrich). Slides were
washed in dH2O, counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated in alco-
hol and Histo-Clear, and mounted in DPX (Sigma-Aldrich).
To quantify human CTB proliferation and apoptosis after immu-
nostaining for Ki67 and M30, six random images of each immunos-
tained explant were captured. The number of Ki67- or M30-positive
CTB was counted by a blinded observer and expressed as a percentage
of the total number of CTB in the field of view; these data were used to
determine a mean number of positive CTB for each explant. n = 4
independent experiments were performed.
Genotyping of P0 fetuses
DNA was extracted from fetal tail tips using a DNeasy extraction kit
(Qiagen). Igf2 P0+/− mutants were identified using a primer pair to
amplify a 740–base pair (bp) fragment across the 5-kb deletion (sense,
5′-TCCTGTACCTCCTAACTACCAC-3′; antisense, 5′-GAGCCA-
GAAGCAAACT-3′) with a third primer amplifying a 495-bp fragment
from the wild-type allele (5′-CAATCTGCTCCTGCCTG-3′), as previ-
ously described (52).
IGF-2 ELISA
To quantify the amount of IGF-2 encapsulated, liposomes (100 ml) were
lysed (Triton X-100; 0.5% in dH2O; 200 ml; 20 min, 37°C), sonicated
(30 min; Ultrawave Ltd.), and centrifuged (1 hour, 13,000 rpm; Heraeus
Pico 21, Thermo Scientific). The supernatant and the pellet were as-
sayed separately by ELISA (human IGF-2 ELISA; MEDiagnostics)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration of
IGF-2 in the supernatant and the pellet were added together to calculate
the total concentration of drug (free within the lipid core and bound to
the lipid wall) administered in each liposome bolus.
Data analysis
Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (version 5). Non-
parametric data were expressed as medians and analyzed using Kruskal-
Wallis test, and parametric data were expressed as means and analyzed
using analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Student’s t test. Frequency
distribution curves were created by constructing fetal weight histograms
and performing nonlinear regression (Gaussian distribution), as previously
described (53). Data from a minimum of three independent experiments
are presented. Significance was taken as P < 0.05, unless otherwise stated.
