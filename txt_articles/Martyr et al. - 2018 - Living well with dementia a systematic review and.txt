Abstract
Current policy emphasises the importance of ‘living well’ with dementia, but there has been
no comprehensive synthesis of the factors related to quality of life (QoL), subjective well-being
or life satisfaction in people with dementia. We examined the available evidence in a system-
atic review and meta-analysis. We searched electronic databases until 7 January 2016 for
observational studies investigating factors associated with QoL, well-being and life satisfaction
in people with dementia. Articles had to provide quantitative data and include ⩾75% people
with dementia of any type or severity. We included 198 QoL studies taken from 272 articles in
the meta-analysis. The analysis focused on 43 factors with sufficient data, relating to 37639
people with dementia. Generally, these factors were significantly associated with QoL, but
effect sizes were often small (0.1–0.29) or negligible (<0.09). Factors reflecting relationships,
social engagement and functional ability were associated with better QoL. Factors indicative
of poorer physical and mental health (including depression and other neuropsychiatric symp-
toms) and poorer carer well-being were associated with poorer QoL. Longitudinal evidence
about predictors of QoL was limited. There was a considerable between-study heterogeneity.
The pattern of numerous predominantly small associations with QoL suggests a need to
reconsider approaches to understanding and assessing living well with dementia.
Introduction
Dementia refers to a group of progressive brain disorders that result in multiple cognitive and
behavioural impairments (Ballard et al. 2011). Enabling people with dementia to ‘live well’
with the condition is a priority for policy and practice (Department of Health, 2009).
Living well with chronic illness and disability is viewed by the Institute of Medicine (2012)
as ‘the best achievable state of health that encompasses all dimensions of physical, mental
and social well-being’ such that ‘to live well takes on a unique and equally important personal
meaning, which is defined by a self-perceived level of comfort, function and contentment with
life’ (p. 32). It is important to gain a clear understanding of the extensive range of factors that
may influence ability to live well with dementia in order to identify potential targets for
intervention.
In instances where it has been discussed explicitly (e.g. Small, 2007), the concept of ‘living well’
with dementia has been equated with experiencing a good quality of life (QoL). Living well can
however mean more to an individual than current QoL. A sense of subjective well-being can be
also associated with living well. Likewise, living well can encompass the experience of a life that is
and has been lived well – life satisfaction. The constructs of QoL, subjective well-being and life
satisfaction are inter-related but encompass distinct elements (Clare et al. 2014a).
Subjective well-being refers to both a positive cognitive appraisal of one’s current situation
and the experience of an appropriate balance of positive and negative emotions (Diener &
https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291718000405
Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. IP address: 77.173.35.219, on 02 Jun 2019 at 13:48:16, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at
 Chan, 2011). In line with this definition, Kitwood’s model of per-
sonhood (1997) emphasises the way in which interactions and
environments contribute to enhancing or detracting from well-
being for people with dementia. Subjective perceptions of satisfac-
tion with life reflect the experience of meaning and purpose, the
ability to experience continued personal growth, a sense of being
in control of one’s life, active social participation and happiness
(St. John & Montgomery, 2010).
QoL is sometimes conceptualised specifically in relation to
health (health-related QoL, HRQoL) (Albert et al. 2001). This is
a narrow formulation, however, and given the pervasive effects
of dementia, there is likely to be considerable overlap between
specific HRQoL and more generic elements of QoL (Wilson &
Cleary, 1995). The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines
QoL much more broadly as ‘an individual’s perceptions of their
position in life in the context of the culture and value systems
in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, stan-
dards and concerns. It is a broad ranging concept affected in a
complex way by a person’s physical health, psychological state,
level of independence social relationships and their relationship
to salient features of their environment’ (p. 1) (World Health
Organization, 1995). There is no single accepted theoretical
model underlying the conceptualisation and assessment of QoL
in dementia, but the most influential formulation is Lawton’s
dementia-specific
framework
(1994),
which
recognises that
adequate measurement of QoL requires evaluation of multiple
dimensions of a person’s life, presenting a broad conceptualisa-
tion that accords well with the WHO definition.
Life satisfaction and subjective well-being have not been studied
in depth in people with dementia, with a few important exceptions
(Zank & Leipold, 2001). QoL has been investigated more substan-
tially, but it has been argued that nevertheless little is known about
the QoL of people with dementia, particularly those with more
severe conditions (Kane et al. 2003; Banerjee et al. 2009; Cordner
et al. 2010), or about whether QoL changes over time as dementia
severity increases. In contrast, QoL can be assessed using either
generic or dementia-specific measures, of which there are several
available (Ready & Ott, 2003; Ettema et al. 2005; Bowling et al.
2015; Algar et al. 2016; Missotten et al. 2016). Although many of
these measures share content themes and conceptual underpin-
nings (Missotten et al. 2016), different measures may yield differ-
ent results. These methodological limitations and complexities
make it difficult to draw clear conclusions about factors associated
with aspects of living well with dementia.
While life satisfaction is typically assessed by self-report and
well-being is typically assessed by informant ratings, QoL in con-
trast may be assessed either directly by self-report or by means of
informant or proxy ratings made by family or health care profes-
sionals. Self-report by people with mild (Woods et al. 2014) and
moderate-to-severe dementia (Hoe et al. 2005) has been shown to
be reliable, though reliability may depend on which measure is
used (Ready & Ott, 2003) and dementia severity. Comparison
of self- and informant ratings in situations where both can be
obtained indicates that informant ratings are typically more nega-
tive than self-ratings (Beer et al. 2010; Moyle & O’Dwyer, 2012;
Crespo et al. 2013), and this has implications for how we evaluate
informant reports of QoL in people with very severe dementia
where
only
informant
or
proxy
ratings
are
possible.
Furthermore, different informants may have different perspec-
tives; for example, ratings made by family carers and paid/profes-
sional carers appear to be associated with different factors (Clare
et al. 2014b; Edelman et al. 2005).
Previous reviews have focused on specific aspects of QoL in
dementia, including dementia-specific HRQoL (Banerjee et al.
2009), measurement (Ready & Ott, 2003; Ettema et al. 2005;
Bowling et al. 2015; Algar et al. 2016; Missotten et al. 2016), resi-
dential care (Lawrence et al. 2012; Moyle & O’Dwyer, 2012;
Beerens et al. 2013; Robertson et al. 2017), qualitative accounts
(O’Rourke et al. 2015a), and a recent narrative overview (Jing
et al. 2016). To date, however, there has been no comprehensive
systematic review and meta-analysis of factors associated with
QoL, well-being and life satisfaction for people with dementia.
A careful and comprehensive review is needed to summarise
the evidence. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we
examined evidence from quantitative observational studies in
order to identify factors associated with QoL, well-being and
life satisfaction in people with dementia.

Search strategy
We searched PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycNET,
AgeInfo,
Zetoc,

for
English-language publications until 7 January 2016. The search
comprised two strings. The first string comprised: (well-being

OR QUALID) AND (dementia OR Alzheimer* OR Parkinson*
OR Lewy OR Fronto). The second search string was designed
to identify articles in residential care settings that may not men-
tion dementia in the title or abstract and comprised: (well-being
OR wellbeing OR life satisfaction OR quality of life OR *QoL*
OR health status) AND (nursing home OR long term care OR
assisted living OR residential living OR care home OR respite
OR day care). Names of specific measures used in the searches
were derived from two previous reviews (Ready & Ott, 2003;
Ettema et al. 2005). No date restrictions were imposed. We exam-
ined reference lists of review articles identified in the searches and
searched online for additional publications by first authors of
included studies. The review protocol was registered with
PROSPERO: CRD42014013633.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The population of interest was people with a diagnosis of demen-
tia, irrespective of type, severity, age or living situation. We
included observational studies reporting cross-sectional and/or
longitudinal associations between specific variables and scores
on a standardised questionnaires or rating scales measuring
QoL, life satisfaction or well-being. We excluded studies where
fewer than 75% of participants had dementia, and intervention
studies that did not provide baseline data.
Procedure
Figure 1 shows the article selection process. Title, abstract and
full-text screening were conducted by two independent reviewers

ing stage, with reasons. Study quality was assessed by two inde-

2000;

et

Table S2. Scores from the quality assessment of each article
were summed; articles that scored 19 or lower were judged to
be of poor quality, articles that scored between 20 and 25 were
judged to be of satisfactory quality and articles that scored 26
or greater were judged to be of good quality. A structured pro-
forma was used for data extraction.
A description of each outcome measure used in the included
studies was taken from either the relevant measure development
article or, if this was unavailable, from the most comprehensive
description of the measure provided in an included article.
Based on this description, each measure was classified as assessing
either ‘general QoL’, ‘general HRQoL’, ‘dementia-specific QoL/
HRQoL’, ‘life satisfaction’ or ‘subjective well-being’. This process
was conducted by three authors working independently, with
any disagreements being referred to a fourth individual for
resolution.
Where multiple articles reported data from the same study,
details for each factor were taken from the article reporting the
largest sample size. If an article included data from two sources
[e.g. two different datasets were analysed separately (e.g. Trigg
et al. 2007; Li et al. 2013) or data were analysed separately for
mild and moderate dementia (e.g. Novelli & Caramelli, 2010)],
these were classed as separate studies for the purposes of the ana-
lysis. We extracted correlational data provided in study reports or
regression data, standardised β (Peterson & Brown, 2005), odds
ratios, p values, or t or F statistics converted to correlations,
adopting a standardised correlation direction to facilitate com-
parison (Borenstein et al. 2009).
Statistical analysis
Meta-analysis for each factor was undertaken where comparable
data were available from at least five studies. All computations
were based on Fisher’s z transformations and were conducted
using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 2 (Borenstein et al. 2005)
software which calculated average z scores and p values, weighted
effect r values and 95% confidence intervals. A two-sided 5% sig-
nificance level was applied. Multiple within-study correlations
were averaged to correct for violations of independence, so that
all
available
data
could
be
included
in
the
analysis.
Between-study heterogeneity for each measure was assessed
using the I2 index (Higgins et al. 2003). Estimated effect sizes
(subsequently ‘effect sizes’) ⩽0.09 were considered negligible,
0.10–0.29 small, 0.30–0.49 moderate and ⩾0.50 large (Cohen,

 1988). A random-effects model (DerSimonian & Laird, 1986) was
employed in view of anticipated high heterogeneity across studies.
Where comparisons were described simplyas non-significant, the
correlation was set at zero. Where p values were given as a range,
the value used to calculate the correlation was set at the upper limit
of the range (e.g. for p < 0.05 the value was set at p = 0.049).
Separate analyses were conducted for each of the rating meth-
ods used in cross-sectional studies: self-rating by the person with
dementia, informant rating by a family carer or health care pro-
fessional (reflecting the informant’s appraisal of the person with
dementia), proxy rating by a family carer or health care profes-
sional (reflecting the appraisal that the proxy thinks the person
with dementia would make), and differences between parallel
self- and informant ratings. Longitudinal studies were examined
separately to identify baseline predictors at follow-up.
Pre-specified sub-group analyses examined whether associa-
tions of relevant factors with living well outcomes differed accord-
ing to the type of rating, type of dementia, living situation of the
person with dementia, relationship with the carer or type of
measure.
Random-effects meta-regression analyses were used to investi-
gate pre-specified moderating effects of age and cognitive status,
indicated by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores
(Folstein et al. 1975), on moderate associations where 10
(Borenstein et al. 2009) or more studies were available.
Sensitivity analysis
To examine whether inserting a correlation of 0 for ‘non-
significant’ p values influenced the findings, we removed these
insertions and repeated the meta-analysis. We also investigated
the impact of poor-quality articles on the results. Fourteen articles
judged to be of poor quality (seven of which were conference
abstracts) were removed from the analysis.
Results
We identified 307 articles for inclusion: 282 journal papers, 16

reports, one book chapter and five PhD theses (Fig. 1). These
reported findings from 213 individual studies from 36 countries
mostly in Europe or North America; online Supplementary
Tables S3–S9 provide details and quality ratings. Data on QoL
were reported in 205 studies, well-being in five and life satisfaction
in three.
Measures of QoL, well-being and life satisfaction
The studies utilised 45 measures of QoL, seven measures of well-
being
and
four
measures
of
life
satisfaction
(see
online
Supplementary Table S10). The QoL-AD (Logsdon et al. 2000)
was the most frequently employed measure of QoL in studies
where the focus was self-rated or informant-rated QoL or the dif-
ference between self-rated and informant-rated QoL, including
longitudinal studies. DEMQOL-Proxy (Smith et al. 2005) was
the most frequently employed measure of proxy-rated QoL.
Distributions of scores on QoL measures are shown in online
Supplementary Tables S11–S12c. Self-ratings by people with
dementia on the QoL-AD and EQ-5D were higher than the cor-
responding informant ratings. For all other measures, insufficient
data were available to allow a comparison of different rating types.
Studies included in the meta-analysis
In studies of well-being and life satisfaction, there was no overlap
in the factors for which associations were examined; each study
examined associations with a different set of factors, with the
exception of depression which was included in two separate stud-
ies of well-being. Consequently it was not possible to conduct
meta-analyses of factors associated with well-being and life satis-
faction, and meta-analyses were conducted only for studies exam-
ining QoL. Data from 37639 people with dementia in 198 studies
reported in 272 articles were included (seven studies were
excluded due to lack of any data that met criteria for inclusion
in the meta-analysis). These studies examined associations of
QoL with 159 individual factors relating to the person with
dementia and 69 factors relating to the carer. Data on 33 factors
relating to the person with dementia and 10 factors relating to the
carer were included in the meta-analysis (online Supplementary
Tables S13a–S17).
Self-rated QoL
Self-ratings of QoL by the person with dementia were examined in
130 studies reporting associations with 110 factors relating to the
person with dementia and 34 factors relating to the carer, of which
28 and eight, respectively, were included in the meta-analysis,
based on 129 studies (Fig. 2 and online Supplementary Tables
S13a–b).
Informant-rated QoL
Informant ratings made by the carer were examined in 135 studies
reporting associations with 114 factors relating to the person with
dementia and 56 factors relating to the carer, of which 26 and 10,
respectively, were included in the meta-analysis, based on 130
studies (Fig. 3 and online Supplementary Tables S14a–b).
Proxy-rated QoL
Proxy ratings were examined in 27 studies reporting associations
of 72 factors relating to the person with dementia and 23 factors
relating to the carer, of which nine and one, respectively, were
included in the meta-analysis, based on 22 studies (Fig. 4 and
online Supplementary Tables S15a–b).
Difference between self- and informant-rated QoL
Scores reflecting differences between self-rated and informant-
rated QoL were examined in 23 studies reporting associations
with 30 factors relating to the person with dementia and 13
factors relating to the carer, of which 10 and three, respectively,
were included in the meta-analysis, based on 22 studies (Fig. 4
and online Supplementary Tables S16a–b).
Comparing self-rated and informant-rated effect sizes
For variables that were assessed in relation to more than one of
the different rating methods of self-, informant and proxy ratings
or discrepancies between self- and informant ratings, the direction
of association was consistent in all cases, although the strength of
association varied. Online Supplementary Table S18a–b reports
correlations between effect sizes where factors were examined in
relation to both self-rated and informant-rated QoL.

 Factors associated with better QoL
Greater social engagement, better quality of current relationship
with the carer and religious beliefs/spirituality were moderately
associated with better QoL across rating types. Better functional
ability, self-rated health and awareness, white ethnicity, having a
spouse carer and living in the community, and for people in resi-
dential settings, being cared for in a specialist dementia unit and
receiving more person-centred care had small or mainly small
associations. Small or negligible associations were found for cog-
nitive test scores, self-rated memory functioning and being mar-
ried. The only carer factor with small or moderate associations
with better QoL in the person with dementia was the carer’s self-
rated QoL.
Factors associated with poorer QoL
Depression and neuropsychiatric symptoms showed mainly mod-
erate associations with poorer QoL across rating types. Greater
severity of dementia, anxiety, pain, presence of unmet needs, pres-
ence of co-morbid conditions and living alone showed mainly
small associations. Use of medication, more advanced dementia
and longer duration of stay in residential care showed small or
negligible associations. Carer burden/stress and distress at symp-
toms had moderate or small associations with poorer QoL, while
small associations were found for carer depression, mental health
and time spent caring.
Factors not significantly associated with QoL
Non-significant or negligible associations with QoL were found
across rating types for age, gender or educational level of the per-
son with dementia and carer, income of the person with demen-
tia, type of dementia and disease duration.
Factors predicting longitudinal trajectories of QoL
Baseline predictors of QoL outcomes were examined in 20 longi-
tudinal studies reporting associations with 25 factors relating to
the person with dementia and two factors relating to the carer,
of which only eight factors pertaining to the person with demen-
tia were included in the meta-analysis, based on 19 studies (Fig. 4
and online Supplementary Table S17). Follow-up ranged from 2
months to 5 years (mean 18.2 months). Non-significant or negli-
gible associations were found for gender, age and more advanced

to poorer QoL, and positive scores indicate that factors were related to better QoL.

 dementia. Depression and neuropsychiatric symptoms in the per-
son with dementia had small associations with worse QoL out-
comes, while better baseline QoL ratings, better functional
ability and higher scores on cognitive screening tests had small
associations with better QoL outcomes. Where comparisons
could be made the direction of associations was consistent with
that found in cross-sectional studies.
Heterogeneity and sub-group analyses
There was a moderate-to-large degree of between-study heterogen-
eity for the majority of factors. Sub-group analyses investigated
the effects of (a) dementia sub-type by separately analysing
studies that focused specifically on people diagnosed with
Alzheimer’s disease and studies that did not focus specifically on
people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease; (b) living situation of
the person with dementia (community and residential care
settings); (c) type of carer completing the ratings of QoL (family
member and health care professionals); and (d) type of QoL
measure used (dementia-specific, health-related and generic).
Distinguishing sub-groups in this way had little impact on overall
effect sizes or degree of heterogeneity (online Supplementary
Tables S19a–S23j).
Moderator variables
Meta-regressions for moderate effect sizes found no moderation
effects of age or MMSE score (online Supplementary Tables
S24a–S25d). Sensitivity analyses suggested that inserting 0 for
non-significant p values and removing articles rated poor in qual-
ity had limited impact on the results (online Supplementary
Tables S26a–S34).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive systematic
review exploring factors associated with QoL, well-being and life
satisfaction in people with dementia, and the first meta-analysis
of factors associated with QoL. We found few studies that have
investigated well-being or life satisfaction, possibly because the
policy focus on these constructs is relatively recent; therefore,
meta-analyses could only be conducted for studies assessing
QoL. The majority of studies were cross-sectional, with consider-
able between-study heterogeneity. Although most factors exam-
ined were significantly related to QoL, with the direction of
association consistent across rating types, no factors were strongly
associated, and most associations were small or negligible. Where
moderate associations were found, confidence intervals were

 typically wide. Demographic and disease characteristics were
largely unrelated to QoL, while social, health- and care-related
factors were more likely to show associations. Factors reflecting
relationships, social engagement and functional ability were asso-
ciated with better QoL, along with living in the community and
having a spouse carer, or receiving specialised and person-centred
care in residential settings. Factors indicative of poorer physical
and mental health, such as co-morbid conditions, pain, depres-
sion, anxiety, neuropsychiatric symptoms, more advanced demen-
tia and for people in residential settings a longer duration of stay,
were associated with poorer QoL, as were carer burden and dis-
tress. The moderate associations of carer burden and distress
with informant-rated QoL suggests that subjective burden could
be contributing to lower scores reported in carer-rated as opposed
to self-rated QoL. Due to the small number of factors and hetero-
geneous follow-up periods, longitudinal evidence about predictors
of QoL was limited, with self-rated QoL at baseline the strongest
predictor of later QoL outcomes.
Our observation that demographic factors are largely unrelated
to QoL is consistent with a previous narrative review of HRQoL
(Banerjee et al. 2009). Aside from this, the overall picture is one
of a large number of factors showing occasionally moderate but
mainly small or negligible, though statistically significant, associa-
tions with QoL. A recent narrative review also reported a complex
picture of associations across domains (Jing et al. 2016). Thus,
QoL appears subject to many influences, some inter-related,
which may co-vary in differing combinations to influence individ-
ual ratings.
In line with the current meta-analysis, the importance of posi-
tive relationships and health for QoL has been emphasised in a
recent meta-synthesis of qualitative studies (O’Rourke et al.
2015a). However, that review also highlighted the domains of
agency and place (feeling settled or unsettled), as key elements
of the experience of people with dementia associated with QoL;
these factors have not been reflected in quantitative evaluations

 examined in quantitative studies may not necessarily reflect all
those aspects of life that people with dementia find most relevant.
The finding here of poorer physical and mental health being
related to QoL is consistent with the emphasis on depression,
neuropsychiatric symptoms and functional ability in Lawton’s
dementia-specific model of QoL (Lawton, 1994), and with evi-
dence from qualitative research showing that people with demen-
tia describe mood and functional ability as important for QoL
(O’Rourke et al. 2015a). However, the relevance of other factors
included in Lawton’s model, such as cognitive competencies, is
less well supported by our findings. Our findings further indicate
that, beyond the dimensions identified by Lawton, many other
factors are associated with QoL, though to a lesser degree.
Our review found that numerous measures were employed to
assess QoL, although the QoL-AD (Logsdon et al. 2000) predomi-
nated. Several previous reviews have focused on the measurement
of QoL (Ready & Ott, 2003; Ettema et al. 2005; Bowling et al.
2015; Algar et al. 2016; Missotten et al. 2016). The absence of a
clear shared definition and theoretical model of QoL is reflected
in the wide variation in focus and content among available
measures. Analysis of domains covered in commonly used
measures of dementia-specific QoL (Missotten et al. 2016),
however, indicates that items explore some of the same factors
for which associations with QoL are typically examined, particu-
larly affect, but also social interaction, functional ability, neuro-
psychiatric symptoms, cognition and physical health. This raises
concerns
about
circularity
and
overlap
in
measurement.
Furthermore, it is unclear whether the quantitative assessment
of QoL adequately reflects the perspective of people with
dementia (O’Rourke et al. 2015b). While items in some measures
are based on data from qualitative interviews with people with
dementia, many measures have been developed with little or no
direct input from people with dementia (Bowling et al. 2015)
and few large-scale studies have been conducted that enable
people with dementia to say what is important for their QoL
(Clare et al. 2014a).
Because of the breadth of included studies, we decided to stat-
istically analyse only factors for which there was data available
from five or more studies. Focusing the review in this way allowed
us to summarise current understanding and reduce reporting of
associations for which there was limited evidence. However, this
precluded quantitative analyses for life satisfaction and well-being,
and limited the number of factors in the analysis of longitudinal
studies. We necessarily examined factors separately, and could not
account for likely inter-correlations. A number of studies did not
provide exact data for non-significant findings, so a potential limi-
tation resulted from inserting zero correlations from those studies;
however, this had a minimal effect on associations or heterogen-
eity. Most of the studies that did not focus exclusively on those
diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease analysed responses from peo-
ple with different dementia diagnoses as one group, which pre-
cluded
separate
analysis
for
different
dementia
sub-types.
Methodologically,
the
widespread
misuse
of
the
term
‘proxy’ when researchers mean ‘informant’ created challenges
for comparing
findings
between
studies.
For example,
in
DEMQOL-Proxy (Smith et al. 2005), instructions allow infor-
mants to make either proxy or informant ratings, so ratings
from this instrument were difficult to classify correctly. Our
review highlights the need for application of clear and consistent
terminology and the standardisation of methods (e.g. standard
follow-up periods and sample size calculations), and a robust con-
ceptual and methodological framework to guide work in this area.
The findings point to some limitations in how we understand
and evaluate living well with dementia. Available measures may
not capture what is most meaningful to each individual
(Bowling et al. 2015) or indeed everything that is relevant to living
well. In this respect, broadening the perspective to include sub-
jective well-being and satisfaction with life may be informative;
these constructs have rarely been assessed, and as yet evidence
is limited (Clare et al. 2014a). The pattern we observed of numer-
ous small associations generally supports the idea that QoL is
multifaceted, as suggested by Lawton’s framework (1994). It
might also reflect the operation of individual differences in
what is deemed most important for QoL, so there may be value
in considering more personalised approaches to assessment, par-
ticularly as no QoL measure includes all of the factors that our
review suggests may be important to the QoL of people with
dementia. However, developing and implementing personalised
approaches would present significant challenges.
The findings raise questions about the use of QoL as an out-
come measure in psychosocial intervention trials. First, if QoL is
subject to many influences, changes in one area of life may have lit-
tle effect on the overall picture, so it may not be reasonable to
expect interventions that are effective in improving some primary
outcomes to influence scores on QoL measures. Second, as noted
above, potential circularity in measurement may create a distorted
picture. Therefore, the relevance of QoL measures for assessing
effectiveness of interventions may need re-evaluation.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that efforts to improve QoL might focus on
supporting relationships, social engagement and everyday func-
tioning, addressing poor physical and mental health, and ensuring
high-quality care. However, there is a need for longitudinal evi-
dence that can point to ways of maintaining or improving QoL
over time and enable identification of people at risk of declining
QoL, so that preventive interventions can be targeted to this group.
