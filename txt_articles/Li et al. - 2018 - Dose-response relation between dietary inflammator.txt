ABSTRACT
Background: A newly developed dietary inflammatory index (DII)
to evaluate the inflammatory potential of diets was published re-
cently. Many studies have investigated the link between diet-related
inflammation and human cancer risk, but the results remain contro-
versial.
Objective: We sought to determine the dose-response relation be-
tween DII and human cancer risk based on published epidemiologic
literature.
Design: To summarize evidence, we performed a dose-response
meta-analysis to investigate the association between DII and can-
cer incidence. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web
of Science, and the Cochrane library up to 5 November 2017. Af-
ter data extraction, pooled RRs were calculated and dose-response
analyses were performed using a restricted cubic spline model with
4 knots. Subgroup analyses, sensitivity analyses, and tests for publi-
cation bias were also performed.
Results: In all, 44 high-quality studies with 1,082,092 par-
ticipants were included. The results showed that an elevated

indicated higher cancer risk except for lung cancer and Australian
studies. A linear dose-response relation between DII and overall
cancer risk was found, with an 8.3% increase in the risk of cancer
per DII score. The pooled RR of DII and cancer risk was 1.86 (95%
CI: 1.63, 2.13) from 30 case-control studies but was lower in 14
prospective cohorts (RR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.19, 1.40). The sensitivity
analysis and Egger’
s test supported the main results.
Conclusions: Our analysis indicated that higher DII is significantly
correlated with cancer risk. More prospective studies with large sam-
ple sizes, involving more ethnic groups and different cancer types, are
required in the future. This review was registered with PROSPERO
as CRD42017077075.

INTRODUCTION
Cancer is a major public health problem associated with high
morbidity and mortality worldwide. There were ∼14.1 million
new cancer cases and 8.2 million cancer deaths globally in 2012
(1). Although measurable progress has been made with treatment
strategy, cancer remains a major challenge. It is increasingly ac-
knowledged that chronic inflammation plays a critical role in tu-
mor generation and development (2–4). As a significant part of
daily life, diet is a major source of bioactive components that may
potentially contribute to the interaction with chronic inflamma-
tion (5). Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the relation between
diet-related inflammation and the risk of cancer.
The dietary inflammatory index (DII) recently developed by
the University of South Carolina’
s Cancer Prevention and Con-
trol Program is a novel scoring system for both pro- (higher DII
score) and anti-inflammatory (lower DII score) individual dietary
patterns derived from peer-reviewed literature (6). Previously, the
paucity of research on diet, inflammation, and cancer in the same
article was probably due to the lack of a methodologic standard.
Inflammatory parameters, such as C-reactive protein, IL-6, and
cancer risk, have been explored separately in several studies (7,
8), and subsequently the DII was found to correlate with these
(9–11). Hence, based on global nutritional surveillance data sets,
the DII can be applied to quantitative comparisons of dietary

inflammatory status and health outcomes in diverse popula-
tions (6). Accumulating epidemiologic evidence demonstrates
the value of the DII in chronic disease prediction (12). Given that,
we can speculate that the DII may help to clarify the connection
between dietary intake and risk of cancer.
In the last few years, a growing body of research on the DII and
the incidences of various tumors, such as digestive tract, urologic,
and gynecologic cancers, has emerged (13–52). However, the re-
sults remain inconsistent and controversial. So far, to the best
of our knowledge, only 2 published systematic reviews (53, 54)
have discussed the relation between the DII and cancer risk, but
only 4 (55) and 22 (56) studies about the DII were included, re-
spectively. Thus, the objective of our study was to systematically
and comprehensively pool and summarize results on the relation
between the DII and overall cancer risk using a meta-analysis
method.
METHODS
Search strategy
This meta-analysis was conducted under the guidelines of the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses (PRISMA) (57). A comprehensive literature search
for relevant studies in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and
the Cochrane Library was performed up to 5 November 2017
(publication search time was left open). The searching strat-
egy consisted of medical subheadings and keywords. The main
terms were as follows: (“pro-inflammatory diet” OR “dietary
inflammatory index” OR “anti-inflammatory diet” OR “inflam-
matory potential intake”) AND (“neoplasm [Mesh]” OR “tu-
mor*” OR “cancer*” OR “malignan*” OR “carcinoma”) AND
(“risk” OR “incidence” OR “odds”). The language of the
studies, population, and sample size were not restricted. We
also manually searched reference lists for additional relevant
publications.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Studies meeting the following criteria were considered eli-
gible: 1) epidemiologic studies that evaluated the DII and the
incidence of human cancers; 2) the participants studied were
from the general population; 3) the DII was measured at baseline,
using the continuous DII or the highest category of DII compared
with the lowest category of DII; and 4) studies reported the orig-
inal RR or OR with the 95% CI, or sufficient information was
given to enable the RR or OR to be extracted.
The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) repeated publica-
tions; 2) studies reporting on <30 patients; and 3) experimental
laboratory articles, nonhuman animal studies, letters, or review
articles.
Assessment of study quality
Two authors (DL and XH) independently reviewed all relevant
articles and judged the methodologic quality of potential studies
using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) as-
sessment tool, including selection, comparability, and outcome
(57). A study was considered high quality if its NOS score was
≥7. Discrepancies between these 2 authors were resolved by a
group discussion with a third author (HD).
Data extraction
We extracted the following variables from each study: the first
author’
s name, publication year, study design, country or region
of the participants, type of cancers, sample size and number of
cancer cases, age, sex, multivariate adjustments, and RRs with
95% CIs. If the RRs of both univariate and multivariate analysis
for the same comparison were available, we only adopted the lat-
ter for analysis. If necessary, the corresponding author was con-
tacted for further information.
Statistical analysis
RRs with 95% CIs were pooled using a meta-analysis method
to assess the relation between the DII and the cancer risk. The
ORs from case-control studies were considered as approximate
estimates for RRs from prospective cohorts (56, 58), because
cancer morbidity was relatively low. The DII values from the
included studies were either continuous variables or categorical
(the highest compared with the lowest). The Cochrane Q test was
used to determine the heterogeneity among studies. A P value
<0.10 indicated heterogeneity. Inconsistency (I2) was also cal-
culated to evaluate heterogeneity. An I2 value >50% was consid-
ered to indicate heterogeneity (59). The fixed-effects model was
used to calculate pooled results when no heterogeneity existed
among included studies; otherwise, a random-effects model was
used.
To find reasons for heterogeneity among studies, we conducted
subgroup analyses on study design, ethnic differences, male and
female sex, colon and rectal cancer, study quality, and differ-
ent number of cancer cases, respectively. The median value of
the number of cancer cases was chosen to divide the subgroups.
Meta-regression was also performed by using cancer site, sample
size, and sex proportions as covariates.
The RRs and ORs and their 95% CIs were extracted from ev-
ery study included in each category of DII from the lowest to the
highest. Dose values of each DII category were also extracted. If
the dose values were not given directly, they were assigned using
the midpoint of each category (60). When the highest (lowest)
category was open ended, we assigned the lower end value of the
category adding (reducing) the closest neighboring category dose
interval value (61). If person-years were not given, they were cal-
culated from cases and corresponding RRs (62). To assess more
conservative results, we adopted a random-effects 4-knot cubic
spline (non-linear) model (63). The glst command in STATA soft-
ware (Stata Corporation) was used to perform the dose-response
analysis (64).
To test the reliability of the main outcomes in our analysis,
sensitivity analysis was performed by removing a single study in
turn. Egger’
s and Begg’
s tests with funnel plots were used to test
publication bias (65, 66). A P value >0.1 indicated no potential
publication bias. We used STATA 12.0 software to conduct all
the statistical analyses. A 2-sided P value <0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

Flow chart of literature search and study selection.
RESULTS
Study search and characteristics
The process of literature selection is shown in a flow diagram
(Figure 1). A total of 976 studies were initially identified by
searching the databases. By screening the titles and abstracts, 85
potential studies were retrieved; 43 studies were then excluded
after further review because they had insufficient data (41 stud-
ies) or consisted of the same group of patients (2 studies). Graf-
fouillère et al. (16) investigated prostate cancer (PCa) and breast
cancer (BrCa), whereas Lu et al. (36) separately researched squa-
mous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. We
regarded those different outcomes as different studies. Finally, 42
articles (13–54) with 44 studies met the inclusion criteria for our
meta-analysis.
The baseline information on studies is shown in Table 1.
The articles were published from 2014 to 2017, and included
1,082,092 participants with 48,345 cancer cases, highlighting the
recent interest in investigating this topic. All studies utilized the
same method of assessing the DII score based on self-reported
or interviewed food-frequency questionnaires. Among them, 11
studies were carried out in (South or North) American countries,
5 in Asia, 16 in Italy, 8 in other European countries, 2 in Australia,
and 2 in Africa (Table 1). Overall, 14 perspective cohort studies
and 30 case-control studies investigated the association between
DII and cancer incidence.
Quality assessment
While a small variation existed in the methodologic quality of
the included studies, all of them were judged to be of relatively
high quality according to the NOS assessment tool, with scores
ranging from 6 to 9 (Supplemental Table 1).
DII and risk of different cancers
As displayed in Figure 2A, the forest plot showed that the
highest category DII score was significantly associated with
higher risk of human cancers, compared with the lowest category
DII. The pooled RR was 1.58 (95% CI: 1.45, 1.72; P < 0.001,
Figure 2A) from 42 studies. Moreover, elevated continuous DII
was also independently correlated with increasing cancer risk
(pooled RR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.16; Figure 2B).
Subsequently, we performed further analyses based on the sites
of cancer. Eleven studies investigated DII and risk of colorectal
cancer (CRC, Figure 3A). The pooled RR was 1.43 (95% CI:
1.28, 1.59; P < 0.001). Six studies provided RRs for DII and
BrCa risk (Figure 3B). Their pooled RR was 1.33 (95% CI: 1.04,

1.68; P < 0.001). The pooled RR of DII and esophageal cancer
risk based on 5 studies was 2.74 (95% CI: 2.11, 3.57; P < 0.001,
Figure 3C) and no significant heterogeneity existed (I2 = 21.6%,
P = 0.277). Only 2 studies reported DII and lung cancer (LCa)
risk (Figure 3D, RR: 1.27; 95% CI: 0.93, 1.72; P = 0.135). An-
other 6 studies explored DII and the risk of PCa (Figure 3E); their
pooled RR was 1.45 (95% CI: 1.22, 1.73; P < 0.001). No hetero-
geneity was found in the PCa group (I2 = 38.6%, P = 0.149).
Additionally, 2 studies investigated the relation between DII and
renal cancer risk; their pooled RR was 1.32 (Figure 3F, 95% CI:
1.10, 1.59; P = 0.003). A further 2 studies researched DII and
ovarian cancer (OCa) risk, the pooled RR of which was 1.57
(Figure 3G, 95% CI: 1.23, 2.00; P = 0.003).
Subgroup analysis and meta-regression
There was obvious heterogeneity among the included studies
(Figure 2A, I2 = 75.2%; Figure 2B, I2 = 77.7%), and there-
fore we conducted subgroup analysis to seek more information
(Table 2). We conducted meta-analysis on different study de-
signs. However, heterogeneity remained in both prospective co-
hort and case-control studies (Supplemental Figure 1). In epi-
demiologic studies, differences in ethnicity are usually recog-
nized as a critical source of heterogeneity. Notably, we also found
no obvious heterogeneity among studies in Asia (I2 = 9.5%, Sup-
plemental Figure 2B), Italy (I2 = 40.9%, Supplemental Figure
2C), Australia (I2 = 0%, Supplemental Figure 2E), and Africa
(I2 = 0%, Supplemental Figure 2F). Furthermore, we performed
subgroup analysis on gender, study quality, and number of cancer
cases (Table 2). Colon cancer and rectal cancer were also checked
separately. Detailed results for each subgroup are given in Table 2
with corresponding forest plots in Supplemental Figures 1–6. To
summarize, the pooled RRs indicated that high DII was signifi-
cantly associated with higher cancer risk in all subgroups except
in Australian people (HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 0.95, 1.55; Supplemen-
tal Figure 2E).
To seek possible sources of heterogeneity, we also conducted
meta-regression analysis. On account of insufficient data on
other parameters such as tumor grade or stage, we chose can-
cer site, sample size, and sex proportion as covariates to estimate
between-study variance. The result of this model (P = 0.0155)
showed that potential associations may exist between these co-
variates (cancer site: P = 0.391; sample size: P = 0.216;
sex proportion: P = 0.011) and the pooled RR. Varying sex
proportions among different studies was a possible source of
heterogeneity.
Dose-response analysis
Four dose knots at 5% (0), 35% (dose 1), 65% (dose 2), and
95% (dose 3) in the dose range distribution were generated before
dose-response evaluation by the restricted cubic spline method.
The results for each group are listed in Table 3.
Because the dose-response plot (Figure 4A, nonlinear model)
for DII and cancer risk was, from visual inspection, approxi-
mately a straight line, we then used linear testing to recheck these
findings. The results were also meaningful (Plinearity < 0.0001).
The pooled dose-response RR of the linear model was 1.083
(95% CI: 1.060, 1.106; Z value = 7.36, P < 0.001), which meant

that human cancer risk increased by 8.3% when the DII score
increased by 1. The increasing tendency of rising DII to af-
fect cancer risk was not influenced by either prospective cohort
(Figure 4B) or case-control studies (Figure 4C).
Dose-response analyses were also carried out on different
cancer types. This showed that increased DII was significantly
associated with a higher risk of CRC (Figure 5A) and ECa
(Figure 5C) because the fitted curve and 95% CI were >1. The
risk of BrCa (Figure 5B), LCa (Figure 5D), and OCa (Figure 5F)
was on a rising trend with increasing DII, but was not significant.
However, the PCa risk first increased, then decreased when DII
increased (Figure 5E).

Sensitivity analysis
In order to gauge the stability of the results, we conducted
a sensitivity analysis by removing one study at a time to see
whether a single study could have a significant impact on the
pooled RR for cancer incidence. The results were not signif-
icantly altered by removing any one of the included studies
(Figure 6A: categories variable, the highest DII compared with
the lowest; Figure 6B: continuous DII).
Publication bias
The plots of Egger’
s test are displayed in Figure 7. Although
Begg’
s test indicated some potential bias when DII was consid-
ered as a categoric variable (Figure 7A: Begg’
s P = 0.013), Eg-
ger’
s test revealed no significant publication bias in this meta-
analysis about DII and cancer risk irrespective of whether DII
is considered as a categories variable (Figure 7A: Egger’
s test:
P = 0.517, >0.1) or as a continuous variable (Figure 7B: Begg’
s
P = 0.937; Egger’
s P = 0.266).
DISCUSSION
In the current study, we utilized existing evidence from 44
studies with 1,082,092 participants to obtain the result that an
elevated DII independently indicates an unfavorable higher risk
of human cancers (RR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.16) except for LCa
and Australian people. Moreover, individuals with the highest-
category DII score showed 58% increased cancer risk when com-
pared with those with the lowest category DII scores. Importantly,
we came to a novel and objective conclusion that cancer risk
increased by 8.3% when DII score increased by 1 from a linear
dose-response analysis.
Notably, this correlation of high DII and rising cancer risk was
applicable to CRC, BrCa, esophageal cancer, PCa, renal cancer,
and OCa, but not LCa (RR: 1.27; 95% CI: 0.93, 1.72). Only
2 studies (31, 32) were available for meta-analysis on DII and
LCa, so this finding should be interpreted with caution. Subgroup
analysis divided by study design, ethnicity, colon or rectal can-
cer, number of cancer cases, and gender did not significantly af-
fect the main results except in 2 studies from Australia (31, 46)
(RR: 1.21; 95% CI: 0.95, 1.55). In addition, dose-response anal-
ysis showed the same generally rising trend in different cancers.
The results from meta-regression showed that sex proportion may
be a possible source of heterogeneity. However, heterogeneity ex-
isted in both gender subgroups. The results showed that the risk
was higher in male than in female individuals. Taking all the re-
sults mentioned above into consideration, we believed that the
DII could serve as a reliable tool in cancer prevention and risk
evaluation.
The DII, a novel method of assessing dietary inflammation that
is reproducible, convenient, and low cost, can be applied in can-
cer screening among populations or in public health interven-
tions. Previously, several approaches, such as the Dietary Ap-
proaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Score (67), the Healthy
Eating Index (68), and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (69),
have been associated with a decreased risk of all-cause mortality.
In contrast with these indexes, the DII focuses on inflammatory
factors from daily intake. Systemic inflammation plays a crucial
role in tumor progression at almost every step including initia-
tion, progression, and metastasis (70). Diet, as a common com-
ponent of lifestyle, should not be neglected as a potential source
of inflammation. It is widely acknowledged that chronic inflam-
mation can adversely affect body health. Hence, diet habit plays a

crucial role in primary prevention of chronic diseases (71). High
consumption of vegetables, fruits, and fish was found to be in-
versely associated with cancer risk (72–74). However, a West-
ern dietary pattern characterized by high consumption of refined
grains, red meat, sugar and fat was associated with increased odds
of cancer (75–78). Our findings about DII are in accordance with
previous similar studies (71–78), since DII contained the scien-
tific and abundant scoring food items.
The underlying mechanism by which a proinflammatory diet
(high DII score) contributes to a high risk of cancer remains

largely unknown. Above all, proinflammatory diets, such as
the Western diet, may lead to excess weight, high BMI, and
obesity (77), and high BMI or obesity has been shown to be
associated with increased cancer risk (79–81). In addition, mi-
croorganisms may contribute to the inflammatory potential in the
digestive tract, thus leading to colon cancer and other gastroin-
testinal cancers (82, 83). Other studies have revealed that diet
may react with the environment, which is associated with epi-
genetic alterations (including DNA methylation and histone post-
translational modification) and cancer (84, 85). Furthermore, fac-
tors secreted by adipocytes and macrophages, such as TNF-α, are
involved in tumor developments by interacting with cytokines
such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1,
which may be modulated by dietary intake (86). Recently, evi-
dence suggests that microRNA may be a mediator of dietary in-
flammation and cancer (87, 88). Overall, the DII can qualitatively
and accurately evaluate the inflammatory potential of a diet re-
gardless of multiple molecular pathways.
Although this is the first dose-response meta-analysis concern-
ing the DII and human cancer risk, several limitations still need
to be addressed. First, although we did not restrict the language,
all the 44 studies included were published in English. We found
no relevant studies published in Chinese that qualified, accord-
ing to the inclusion criteria, and we also failed to identify articles
in other languages, which may have led to a degree of language
bias. Second, although sensitivity analysis supported the stability
of our results and no publication bias was found, the number of
studies was very small in different cancer types [2 for RCC (45,
52), 2 for LCa (31, 32), 2 for OCa (33, 34)] and in some subgroups
[2 for Australian (31, 46), 2 for African (13, 33)]. Thus, we wish
to emphasize that the results should be interpreted cautiously.
Third, among the 44 included studies, 30 were case-control stud-
ies, which may have been associated with recall bias. In fact,
the pooled RR of DII and cancer risk was 1.86 (95% CI: 1.63,
2.13) from the case-control group, which was larger than that
from the prospective cohort group (RR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.19, 1.40).
Therefore, the recall bias associated with the case-control study
design may have led to overestimated results. Fourth, although
our results were based on data from >1 million participants,
American and European participants comprised the majority

and we found few studies on Asian and African populations.
Therefore, further large prospective cohort studies in diverse pop-
ulations are urgently required to verify the association of DII and
human cancers in the future.
In summary, this meta-analysis suggests that elevated DII is
related to a higher risk of human cancers, and the risk increases
by 8.3% per DII score. However, further prospective trials with
larger sample sizes should be conducted to validate this article’
s
findings.
