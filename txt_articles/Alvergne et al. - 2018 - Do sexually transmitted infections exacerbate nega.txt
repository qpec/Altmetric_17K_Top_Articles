Background and objectives: The underlying reasons why some women experience debilitating premen-
strual symptoms and others do not are largely unknown. Here, we test the evolutionary ecological
hypothesis that some negative premenstrual symptoms may be exacerbated by the presence of chronic
sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
Methodology: 34 511 women were recruited through a digital period-tracker app. Participants were
asked: (i) Have you ever been diagnosed with a STI? (ii) If yes, when was it, and were you given
treatment? Those data were combined with longitudinal cycle data on menstrual bleeding patterns,
the experience of pain and emotions and hormonal contraceptive use.
Results: 865 women had at least two complete menstrual cycle data and were eligible for analysis.
Before diagnosis, the presence of an infection predicts a ca. 2-fold increase in the odds of reporting both
headache, cramps and sadness during the late luteal phase and sensitive emotions during the wider
luteal phase. After diagnosis, the odds of reporting negative symptoms pre-menstrually remain un-
changed among STI negative individuals, but the odds of reporting sensitive emotions decrease among
STI positive individuals receiving a treatment. No relationships between STIs, pain and emotions are
observed among hormonal contraceptive users.
Conclusions and implications: The results support the idea that a negative premenstrual experience
might be aggravated by the presence of undiagnosed STIs, a leading cause of infertility worldwide.
Caution is warranted in extrapolating the results as the data are self-reported, inflammatory levels are
unknown and the tracker is biased towards recording negative premenstrual symptoms among
Western individuals.

 K EYWORDS: reproduction and hormones; evolutionary immunobiology
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS), a chronic condition experienced
by women before their menses and characterized by >200 nega-
tive physical and psychological symptoms (PMSx) including anx-
iety, depression, pelvic pain and headaches [1, 2], is common yet
poorly understood [3]. In Western contexts [3] and in China [6], ca.
80% of fertile women experience one or several symptoms and for
3–8% of naturally cycling women, the experience of the pre-men-
strual period is so debilitating that it is categorized as a premen-
strual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) that requires medical attention
[7, 8]. Therapies considered to be effective include anti-depressant
medication [4], drospirenone-containing combined oral contra-
ceptives [5] and cognitive behavioural therapy [3]. However, mech-
anisms for the onset of PMS and PMDD remain uncertain [5].
There are currently two inter-linked theories for explaining diver-
sity in the experience of PMS: (i) an abnormal response to pro-
gesterone and (ii) lower levels of allopregnanolone, a neuroactive
metabolite of progesterone with antidepressant action [3]. While
biomedical research views premenstrual changes as the mark of a
hormonal and psychological disease rather than a natural event,
an evolutionary perspective points to the fundamental dialogue
between the immune and neuroendocrine systems for under-
standing the health of living organisms [6].
Evolutionary approaches to the menstrual cycle conceptualize
both menstruation and PMS as by-products of the evolution of the
immune system in female bodies [4, 5] (see also [13, 14] for other
evolutionary views). In menstruating species, growing evidence
suggests that the uterus has evolved to be ‘choosy’, i.e. avoid
maternal investment in compromised embryos [7–9]. This pro-
cess, referred to as cyclic and spontaneous decidualization of
the endometrium [10], takes place in the luteal phase and is
underpinned by a bi-phasic immune response that optimizes
the balance between embryo selectivity and embryo receptivity.
In non-conceptive cycles, the ‘preparation’ of the endometrium is
followed by menstruation, a massive inflammatory event neces-
sary for the regeneration of the endometrium [10]. Thus, success-
ful reproduction is critically dependent on the menstrual
regulation of immunity, which is partly achieved through the ac-
tions of progesterone and oestrogen [11], two sex hormones
produced by the ovaries (in non-conceptive cycles) and for which
there are receptors on many immune cells [17]. As a result of
hormonally induced shifts in immune function during the men-
strual cycle, female health is expected to be cyclical [12] and pre-
menstrual changes are expected to be a normal part of women’s
experience. Although results are somewhat mixed, there is
accumulating evidence that disease vulnerability, susceptibility
and exacerbations do vary across the menstrual cycle [12].
Recent research has queried whether PMS can be understood
as an ‘inflammatory disease’ [13, 14]. At first glance, such wording
reinforces the negative cultural construction of premenstrual
changes as pathological and fail to recognize that the premen-
strual phase can be empowering [15]. However, PMS is also a lived
experience and there is evidence that women do indeed report
negative symptoms both in sociocultural contexts where premen-
strual changes are seen as normal (e.g. in India and China where
pain, fatigue and water retention are reported) and in Western
contexts where they are seen as pathological (e.g. in the US or
in Europe where negative mood symptoms are recorded) [16].
Thus, the underlying causes of PMS remain to be deciphered
and the possibility that diversity in women’s experience of the
premenstrual phase is, at the physiological level, underpinned
by differences in levels of inflammation, is intriguing.
A study among 2 939 US women aged 42–52 years found that
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, a common marker of systemic
inflammation, was associated with some PMSx (mood, cramps
and weight gain) but not with others (headache and breast
pain)[14]. Another study among 277 US women aged 18–30
suggested that pro-inflammatory factors, which result in sickness
behaviour, depression [17] and impaired social interactions
through immune-to-brain-signalling communication pathways
[18], are elevated in women experiencing PMS [13]. However,
the luteal-phase administration of progesterone aimed at
lowering the inflammatory response is not efficacious to amelior-
ate PMS [19]. Further, a meta-analysis of 14 studies shows that
treatment with either progesterone or progestogen showed no
benefit in symptom reduction compared to placebo effects [19,
see also, 20]. Rather, progestogens in second-generation pills
(levonorgestrel or norethisterone) have been found to be
regenerating PMS-type symptoms [3]. This suggests that the aeti-
ology of PMS does not lie in differences in absolute levels of pro-
gesterone, but more likely in the cyclical variation of the hormone.
Indeed, changes in hormone concentration, e.g. falling levels of
progesterone in the days preceding the onset of the menses, are
thought to carry more biological value that any given level at any
given time [21].
One recent evolutionary hypothesis suggests that severe PMS
might arise from the exacerbation of persistent infections [4, 5].
Doyle and Ewald proposed that the weakening of the immune
response during the mid-luteal phase allows for the growth of
pre-existing pathogen populations. Such infections might go un-
noticed and persist, which is particularly expected in cases when
natural selection favours low levels of virulence, such as sexually
transmitted infections for which opportunities of transmission
are low [22]. There is now some evidence that higher susceptibility
to bacterial, viral and fungal infections in the low-inflammatory
PMS and sexually transmitted infections

 (mid-luteal)-phase of the cycle is associated with high levels of
progesterone [12]. If cyclical immunosuppression allows for
pathogen load to increase during the second (luteal) phase of
the cycle, then the pre-menstrual drop in both progesterone and
oestrogen levels provoking the onset of the inflammatory reaction
eventually leading to menstruation will be heightened. This leads
to exacerbated premenstrual symptoms.
In a pioneering study, Doyle and colleagues investigated the
link between sexually transmitted infections and depression and
other PMSx, in particular headache, pain and nausea [23]. The
study was based on medical records for 500 regularly cycling
women, of which 120 were diagnosed with PMS (24%).
Infections investigated were both viruses (Human papillomavirus;
HPV) and bacteria (Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrheae,
Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida albicans and Trichomonas vaginalis).
The main result was the association between C. trachomatis and
two common PMSx: depression and pain. T. vaginalis was
associated with headache while G. vaginalis was associated with
nausea. Symptoms were not associated with lifestyle variables
such as diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, drug use and exer-
cise. However, given only the presence and not the timing of oc-
currence of symptoms was recorded, causality could not be
inferred. In addition, the authors specify that the medical categor-
ization of PMS had often been conflated with dysmenorrhoea (i.e.
painful menstruation usually associated with abdominal cramps),
which thus precludes distinguishing menstrual from premen-
strual symptoms. Another recent study based on clinical files from
148 women evaluated retrospectively the link between, on the one
hand, anti-bacterial treatment, cervical/stromal anti-inflamma-
tory and antibiotic injections combined with intra-cervical cryo-
therapy, and on the other hand, self-rated PMS [24]. The study
reports a positive effect of treatment, with a reduced mean score
of severity of all 10 PMSx (depression, irritability, anxiety, fatigue,
headache, oedema, breast tenderness, abdominal bloating, pelvic
pain and dysmenorrhea). However, the study includes no control,
and the conclusion relies on multiple non-parametric tests. Thus,
the possibility that infection may exacerbate pre-menstrual symp-
toms warrants further investigation.
The main objective of this paper is to test the hypothesis that
sexually transmitted infections (STIs) cause debilitating side-ef-
fects in the days leading to menstruation, a phase during which
PMS typically occurs. Overall, this research is a first step towards
determining under which conditions PMSx and STIs co-occur, and
whether those symptoms might be reliable clinical indicators of
undiagnosed conditions. To circumvent someof the limitations of
previous studies, we collected data using the app Clue, a period-
tracker that has 10 million of active users. Users were asked
whether and when they had been tested for an infection, and the
result of the test. We then paired those data with cycle data before
and after the test for STIs. Cycle data include data on period
length, cycle length and both pain (cramps, headache, tender-
breasts) and emotions (sadness, happiness, sensitive emotions)
as proxies for PMSx (Table 1). We ran analyses to answer the
following two questions: (i) Prior to diagnosis, were PMSx more
likely for women with an STI and unaware about it? (ii) Among
individuals diagnosed positive for an infection, have symptoms
decreased after treatment?
The use of digital health technology for recruiting participants
and data collection comes with bothstrengths and limitations. On
the one hand, through its crowd-sourcing capability, the app en-
ables one to recruit and reach a potentially large number of par-
ticipants. Most importantly, the cycle data can be fine-grained
(through daily entry) and longitudinal (over several cycles), which
greatly enhances the potential for inferring causal rather than cor-
relational effects. Finally, in the long-run, users can contribute to
research while improving their understanding of their own health.
On the other hand, however, data are indirect because informa-
tion is self-reported, and levels of systemic inflammation are not
known. Further, the tracking categories included in the app can be
said to reproduce the cultural construction of PMS that is typical
of Western settings (e.g. the US, Europe and Australia), where the
occurrence of premenstrual changes is viewed as negative and
pathological [16]. Thus, the study primarily informs on the role of
STIs in modifying negative, rather than positive, premenstrual
symptoms in Western populations. Ultimately, this study serves
as a basis for reviewing digital health research capability and im-
proving its tracking categories.
METHODOLOGY
The data
Study population: Clue users
Data were collected using a smart phone app, Clue [25], a period-
tracker first released by BioWink GmbH in 2013. Clue enables
users to collect daily data on menstrual bleeding, emotional
well-being and behaviour and provide them with scientific infor-
mation relating to menstrual health. This study focused on a sub-
section of Clue users, recruiting only from users of the English
version of the app and with a registered account with Clue. This is
because users with an account have given their permission to use
their cycle data for research.
Recruitment process
Before starting data collection, this study was granted ethical
clearance from the Ethical Board of the School of Anthropology
at the University of Oxford (reference SAME_C1A_16_048). The
study was first announced and distributed through an e-mail
based personal review of menstrual cycle data. This e-mail,
referred to as ‘Cycle Review’ in the e-mail subject, is sent since
June 2016 to registered users to situate the user’s data in relation
to aggregated data from other users with similar characteristics.
Starting in July 2016, Clue users could click on the link inviting
them to participate to the study and could enter data after their

 informed consent was obtained. Based on Clue’s previous experi-
ence, it was agreed to include a link to the study in both July’s and
August’s monthly e-mails and stop the data collection by the 31st
of August 2016, a date after which it was expected that no more
responses would be registered. However, given the relatively low
sample size (<20) for the critical group (tested positive and off
hormonal contraceptives) by the end of the data collection period,
we decided to advertise the study on Clue’s blog and at an ‘influ-
encer event’ taking place at Clue headquarters in September 2016.
The data collection was finally stopped exactly 3 months after the
first responses came in (by July the 19th), by October the 19th,
after the additional advertizing push was over (see Supplementary
Figure S1 for the distribution of survey responses across time).
We used the Typeform platform to collect data and follow the data
collection process.
Survey data
The survey included questions on key variables of interest, i.e. the
occurrence and the date of the latest completed medical test for a
sexually transmitted infection (STI), its result and treatment, if
Table 1. Text given in the Clue app to describe the options for tracking emotion (happy, sensitive and
sad) and pain (cramps, headache and tender breasts)
Tracking options
Description
HAPPY—Content and cheerful
Despite the dominant belief that the premenstrual phase and
bad moods go hand in hand for everyone, some people experi-
ence positive moods in relation to their cycle. If you’re looking
for patterns between your mood and your menstrual cycle,
tracking both positive and negative mood is important.
SENSITIVE—Easily triggered
Some people report crying spells or feeling sensitive or tearful
during the premenstrual phase.
SAD—Feeling a bit down
Some people report crying spells and feeling depressed, anxious,
nervous or blue during the premenstrual phase. If you experi-
ence sadness that is regularly severe enough to interfere with
your relationships or other aspects of day-to-day life, it may be
a good time to talk to your doctor.
CRAMPS—Pain from cramping of the uterus,
which may also be felt in the lower back and thighs
Cramps are common pain symptoms in the days before and
during menstruation. Scientists suspect that cramps may be
caused by an excess of prostaglandins, which are hormone-like
substances that help the uterus contract to shed the uterine
lining.
HEADACHE—A sustained ache in the head
Headaches are common premenstrual and menstrual symptoms.
Prostaglandins, which are hormone-like substances that help
the uterus contract to shed the uterine lining, have been
proposed to play a role.
Migraines are intense headaches that may be accompanied by
pulsating pain, sensitivity to light and noise, nausea and/or
vomiting. Migraines are classified as with or without aura. Many
people with migraines report an association between menstruation
and migraine incidence. People with migraines also report changes
in migraine experience throughout their reproductive lifespan
relating to first period, oral contraceptive use, pregnancy and/or
menopause. Changing estrogen levels are believed to mediate
these changes and taking extra estrogen (as hormonal birth con-
trol or hormonal replacement therapy) may make migraines worse.
TENDER BREASTS—Sore breasts due
to water retention
Breast pain is a common premenstrual pain symptom. Pain is
often diffuse and felt in both breasts. Increased water content
due to changing hormone levels in the luteal phase is a
likely factor.

 appropriate, along with confounding variables, i.e. age, the use of
hormonal contraception (pill, patch, hormonal IUD, implant, in-
jection), the use of vitamins and/or supplements, the regular up-
take of any form of medication, the occurrence of unprotected sex
as well as the reason for the test. Conflating variables are likely to
influence the results in the following ways: first, whether women
used hormonal contraceptives or not at the time of the STI test is
critical because the hormonal contraceptives partly remove cyc-
lical immunity and interfere with the immune system. Second,
food supplements have been suggested to influence PMSx, and
a few studies suggest that calcium and Vit B6 supplementation
may be an effective treatment (reviewed in [3]). Third, the uptake
of regular medication for treating chronic conditions such as auto-
immune diseases, diabetes or endometriosis might influence hor-
monal levels and thus impact the relationship between STI and
PMS in complex ways.
Menstrual cycle data
Survey data were combined with cycle data for registered Clue
users who reported to have been tested for an infection in the
past, for whom no multiple survey entries were detected, for
whom cycle data before and after the cycle during which the test
occurred were available and for whom cycles were within the nor-
mal range, as defined by the American College of Obstetricians
and Gynaecologists [26], i.e. a cycle length ranging from 24 to
38 days and a period length of up to 8 days. For each survey par-
ticipant, the cycle data belonging to two cycles were retrieved. The
two cycles were chosen to be the closest full cycle before the test
and closest full cycle after the results. For each day of the two
cycles, data were extracted with regards to a number of symptoms
both recorded in the app and known to be positively or negatively
correlated with PMS: cramps, headache, tender breasts, happy,
sad, sensitive emotions (see Table 1 for details given to partici-
pants for each tracking category). Each symptom category is pre-
sented on a screen with four options, which are not exclusive, and
it is possible to select all symptoms together in the same day. For
each day of each cycle, when no data have been entered for a
particular symptom, the presence of a symptom was coded 0 only
if other data had been entered that day, otherwise it was coded as
missing data. In addition to symptomatic data, data on cycle
length and period length for each cycle were added to the dataset.
Statistical analysis
The analysis aims at answering the following two questions: (Q1)
Does the presence of an undiagnosed infection exacerbate the
occurrence of pre-menstrual symptoms? (Q2) Do PMS-like symp-
toms improve after diagnosis and treatment? All analyses were
performed using the R software version 3.3.3. [27] and aggregate
data are available on Figshare data repository [28]. Individuals
data are not available to ensure the anonymity of participants.
(Q1) Does the presence of an undiagnosed infection
exacerbate the occurrence of pre-menstrual symptoms?
This analysis investigates whether the probability of experiencing
PMS-like symptoms is significantly different between STI+ and
STI- individuals in the cycle just preceding the cycle during which
participants took a medical test. A model was run for each of the
pain and emotion symptoms available in the app and commonly
associated with PMS (see Table 1 for a detailed description).
Symptoms were kept as distinct response variables rather than
combined through a principal component analysis because this
method is usually not reliable in the case of dichotomous vari-
ables (Dr. Lunn, Oxford Statistics, pers. com). Explanatory vari-
ables were infection status (infected/not-infected), phase (early
luteal/late luteal, detailed below), age (continuous), cycle length
(continuous), regular use of medicine (yes/no), vitamins (yes/no)
and hormonal contraceptive use (yes/no). Age and cycle length
were not normally distributed thus these variables were log trans-
formed prior to be entered in the models. Given that BMI is a poor
measure of health [29] and there were many missing data for self-
reported height and weight, we did not include this variable.
Mixed logistic regression with temporal autocorrelation. Symptoms
can be recorded every day and were recorded on a binary scale
(presence/absence), thus, we used a logistic regression routine.
Toaccount forthe structure of the data (binary response variables,
repeated data within individuals and within countries, temporal
autocorrelation between the days of the cycle), we used a mixed
logistic regression routine with varying intercepts for individual
ID, and with a temporal autocorrelation structure for the residuals
(cycle days nested within individuals). This was possible using the
glmmPQL function of the ‘nlme’ package [30]. One advantage of
multi-level analysis is that it can account for unbalanced designs
[31], such as found in our data, thanks to the use of best unbiased
linear prediction for estimating random effects. Intra-class correl-
ations coefficients (% of between group variability in the observed
variance) range from 0.86 to 0.92. The tables are displayed using
the ‘texreg’ package [32].
Determining the pre-menstrual phase. To test for the occurrence
of a link between infection and the timing of the symptoms we
included a variable Cycle Phase in each model to distinguish be-
tween symptoms reported in the early and in the late luteal
phases. We restricted the data to the luteal phase (onset of men-
struation—14 days) because: (i) premenstrual symptoms only
occur in the luteal phase, (ii) for individuals diagnosed with an
infection, it is not known when they were infected thus the closer
the data are to the time of test the more likely diagnosed individ-
uals were already infected, (iii) the luteal phase shows the least
inter-individual variability compared to the follicular phase [33]
making the comparison between women more meaningful and
(iv) most of the data are collected during the menses, which dis-
torts the signal towards the menstrual, follicular period.

 It is not obvious when the pre-menstrual (i.e. the late luteal)
phase should start. Pre-menstrual symptoms can start as early as
2 weeks before the menses according to the NHS [2], however in
this paper we assume that symptoms occur as the result of falling
progesterone levels and the subsequent activation of the immune
response [34]. Thus, the relevant pre-menstrual phase should
start when progesterone levels start falling, about 7 days before
the menses [1]. To restrict the number of models performed, we
assumed that the window within which the signal is likely to be the
strongest is between 3 and 5 days before the menses (for 1 and
2 days, there might not be enough data and for 6 and 7 days, pro-
gesterone may not have fallen enough yet). We then created three
dichotomous variables: Cycle Phase 3d [late luteal (3 days before
the onset of the menses)/early luteal (other days)], Cycle Phase 4d
[late luteal (4 days before the onset of the menses)/early luteal
(other days)] and Cycle Phase 5d [late luteal (5 days before the
onset of the menses)/early luteal (other days)].
Comparing models. To better understand the determinants of
diversity in the experience of PMSx, the following model structure
was used: Cycle Phase * Infection Status * Hormonal Contraceptives
Use + log (Age) + log (Cycle length) + Supplements + Medication. For
each PMSx, we ran and compared three models, each varying by
how the late luteal phase was defined (either 3 days (Cycle Phase
3d), 4 days (Cycle Phase 4d) or 5 days (Cycle Phase 5d) before the
menses). In each model, we included the interaction Cycle Phase *
Infection Status to test for an effect of infection on the exacerbation
of PMSx in the late luteal phase. We also included an interaction
(*) with the uptake of hormonal contraceptives because the effect
of infection on the experience of PMSx is predicted to be less
visible among contraceptive users. This is because the magnitude
of the rise and the fall of progesterone levels is less important
among users of hormonal contraceptives [1].
The glmmPQL function uses penalized likelihood estimation,
thus it is not possible to obtain an AIC and use standard model
comparison techniques. We kept a frequentist approach and per-
formed, for each model, a Wald �2 test on all coefficients using the
package ‘aod’ [35] to test coefficients jointly given their variance
covariance matrix. For each model, we plotted a receiver operating
characteristic curve (ROC) and computed a measure of the accur-
acy of the chosen model in predicting the data using the area
under the curve (AUC). All measures of AUC were >94%.
Estimates and confidence intervals were converted to odd-ratios
using the inverse logit function exp(x)/(1+exp(x)) in reporting the
results. Effects that are independent of how the cycle phase is
defined are considered robust.
(Q2) Do PMSx improve after diagnosis and treatment?
Based on the results of the first analysis (Q1), we investigated
whether the relationship between infectious status and the occur-
rence of PMSx was reduced after treatment. Three groups of par-
ticipants were compared: (i) participants tested and diagnosed
positive, and who received treatment; (ii) participants tested and
diagnosed positive, and who did not receive treatment and (iii)
participants tested and diagnosed negative. To avoid including
quadruple interactions and drawing on the results obtained for
(Q1), we restricted the data to women who were not using
hormonal contraception at the time of their test. We restricted
the analysis to PMSx for which the relationship with infection
status was found to be robust in (Q1). For each model, we plotted
a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and computed a
measure of the accuracy of the model in predicting the data using
the area under the curve (AUC). Estimates and confidence inter-
vals were converted to odd-ratios using the inverse logit function
exp(x)/(1+exp(x)) in reporting the results.
RESULTS
Descriptive statistics
A total of 34 511 individuals started the survey, of which 30 605
gave their informed consent. Among those, 33% (10 054) reported
to have ever been tested for an infection. The infections recorded
were HPV (34%), C. trachomatis (33%), Herpes simplex virus (24%),
N. gonorrhea (4%), T. vaginalis (4%), C. albicans (3%), syphilis
(Treponema pallidum) (<1%), hepatitis (<1%) and others (7%).
From the pool of users who had ever been tested for an infection,
we restricted the sample to users with the relevant data, i.e. age and
complete cycles before and after the cycle during which testing
occurred, and with cycles within the normal range, as defined by
the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists [26], i.e.
a cycle length ranging from 24 to 38 days and a period length of up
to 8 days. Further, we restricted our analysis to individuals aged
18–45 years because teenagers and pre-menopausal women often
have irregular cycles and low hormonal production [for review see,
36]. In the final sample used for analysis (N = 865), which includes
both hormonal contraceptive users (N = 241) and non-users (N =
624), the medianage of users at the time of the survey was 26 years,
the median cycle length was 28 days and the median period length
was 4 days (Table 2). In the final sample, 6.7% (N = 58) of indi-
viduals tested positive, of which 60% were prescribed a treatment
(N = 35), which was completed by 96% of individuals. Most users
were from English speaking countries (the US: 59%; the UK:
11.9%; Canada: 8.2%; Australia, 5.6%).
Inferential statistics
Do women with an undiagnosed sexually transmitted
infection experience more pre-menstrual symptoms (Q1)?
This analysis is based on a between-women design and uses data
recorded during the cycle prior to the one during which women
undertook a STI test. We used a multi-level logistic regression
routine to investigate the role of infectious status for explaining
variation in the experience of PMSx both during the late luteal
PMS and sexually transmitted infections

 phase and during the wider luteal phase. The results depend on
the symptom investigated and on whether or not women are using
hormonal contraception at the time of the test (Fig. 1).
(i) Women off hormonal contraception (N = 624). We found ro-
bust evidence that the presence of an undiagnosed infection is
associated with the exacerbation of headaches in the days before
the onset of the menses, independently of how the pre-menstrual
phase is defined. STIs are also associated with an increase in the
overall experience of sensitive emotions.
Physical symptoms. Cramps, headache and tender breasts ap-
pear to be valid PMSx as they are more likely to be experienced in
the late luteal phase as compared with the rest of the luteal phase
(Table 3). Cramps: STI+ individuals are ca. 2 times (OR = 2.41,
95CI [1.08; 5.38]) more likely to experience cramps during the
5 days preceding the onset of their periods as compared with
non-infected women. This effect is not observed when the late
luteal phase is defined as 3 or 4 days before the menses, however.
Headache: STI+ individuals are ca. 2 times more likely to experi-
ence headache during the last 5 days of their cycle compared with
the rest of the luteal phase (OR = 2.36, 95CI [1.19; 4.69]), and this
effect is also observed when the late luteal phase is defined as 3 or
4 days before the menses. Tender breasts: the presence of infection
does not exacerbate this physical premenstrual symptom
(OR = 1.95, 95CI [0.90; 4.19]).
Psychological symptoms. Sad, sensitive emotions and happiness
appear to be valid PMSx as they are more likely to be experienced
during the late luteal phase as compared with the rest of the luteal
phase (Table 4). Sensitive emotions: STI+ individuals are >2 times
more likely to experience sensitive emotions (OR = 2.61, 95CI [1.21;
5.60]), independently of the phase of the menstrual cycle. Sad: STI+
individuals are >2 times more likely to experience sadness in the
3 days preceding the menses (OR = 2.36, 95CI [1.07, 5.17]), but this
effect is not robust to how the late luteal phase is defined. Happy:
the presence of an infection does not further decrease happiness in
the late luteal phase (OR = 0.74, 95CI [0.33; 1.65]).
(ii) Women on hormonal contraception (N = 241). A link between
infection and the exacerbation of pain and emotions in the late
luteal phase is never observed among contraceptive users. Using
hormonal contraceptives mostly relates to the experience of ten-
der breasts, and to a lesser extent, sadness.
Physical symptoms. Cramps: Hormonal contraceptive users do
not experience less cramps as compared with non-users
(OR = 0.76, 95CI [0.48; 1.22]), even in the presence of an infection
(OR = 1.99, 95CI [0.35; 11.40]), or during the late luteal phase
(OR = 1.30, 95CI [0.89; 1.88]) (Table 3). Headaches: Hormonal
contraceptive users do not experience less headaches as
compared with non-users (OR = 0.79, 95CI [0.49; 1.30]), even in
the presence of an infection (OR = 0.59, 95CI [0.10; 3.50]), or dur-
ing the late luteal phase (OR = 1, 95CI [0.69; 1.45]). Tender Breasts:
Users of hormonal contraception experience less symptoms in
the last 3 days of their cycle (OR = 0.60, 95CI [0.37, 0.96]), but
the result is not robust to how the pre-menstrual phase is defined.
Psychological symptoms. Sad: Users of hormonal contraception
and diagnosed with an infection experience less sadness in the
last 3 days of their cycle (OR = 0.64, 95CI [0.42; 0.96]), but the
effect is not robust to how the pre-menstrual phase is defined
(Table 4). Sensitive emotions: Hormonal contraceptive users do
not experience less sensitive emotions as compared with non-
users (OR = 0.83, 95CI [0.56, 1.22]), even in the presence of an
infection (OR = 0.50, 95CI [0.12, 2.07]), or during the late luteal
phase (OR = 0.99, 95CI [0.71, 1.38]). Happy: Hormonal contracep-
tive users do not experience more happiness as compared with
non-users (OR = 1, 95CI [0.64; 1.57]), in the presence of an infec-
tion (OR = 1.97, 95CI [0.37; 10.44]), or during the late luteal phase
(OR = 0.86, 95CI [0.59; 1.25]).
Do women diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection
experience less symptoms after treatment (Q2)?
We investigated whether PMSx are reduced after the diagnosis
and/or treatment of an STI (Table 5). We restricted the analysis to
women off hormonal contraceptives because we did not observe
anexacerbation of PMSx among users of hormonal contraception.
We also restricted our analyses to the two symptoms found to be
the most influenced by the presence of an infection: headache and

 sensitive emotions. Three groups of women were compared: (i)
women diagnosed negative for a STI (N = 585), (ii) women
diagnosed positive for a STI but not receiving treatment
(N = 14), (iii) women diagnosed positive for a STI and receiving
treatment (N = 25). Among individuals diagnosed STI-, diagnosis
alone is not sufficient to reduce headache (OR = 1.06, 95CI [0.84,
1.34]) or sensitive emotions (OR = 1.20, 95CI [0.96, 1.48]). Among
individuals diagnosed STI+, headache does not decrease follow-
ing treatment (OR = 1.23, 95CI [0.38, 3.99]) but, counter-intui-
tively, reduces in the absence of a medical prescription for the
STI (OR = 0.00, 95CI [0.001, 0.12]). Conversely, the odds of
experiencing sensitive emotions reduce in the cycle following both
diagnosis and treatment (OR = 0.36, 95CI [0.14, 0.88]) while no
changes are observed for STI+ individuals who did not receive
treatment (OR = 1.99, 95CI [0.57, 6.99]).
DISCUSSION
Why women experience negative premenstrual symptoms has
recently been linked to inflammation [13, 14, 24], and it has been
suggested that PMS is best conceptualized as an ‘inflammatory
disease’ [24]. While the proximate causes of premenstrual inflam-
mation might be well understood, i.e. falling levels of progester-
one near the onset of the menses activate an inflammatory
response, the ultimate reasons why there is variation in levels of
inflammation between and within women has received little at-
tention (but see [23, 24]). In this paper, we investigate the possi-
bility that negative premenstrual symptoms are exacerbated by
the presence of a sexually transmitted infection using digital
health data from Clue, a period-tracker app for smart phones.
This hypothesis, put forward by Doyle and Ewald [34], posits that
a pre-existing pathogen load would grow in the mid-luteal phase
as a result of the anti-inflammatory environment promoted by
high progesterone levels. This increased pathogen load would
lead to the exacerbation of inflammatory symptoms pre-
menstrually, when progesterone levels are falling. The hypothesis
focuses on STIs because they are good candidates for chronic
diseases: according to the virulence-transmission trade-off hy-
pothesis [22], persistence within host is more likely to be favoured
by natural selection when opportunities for transmission are
Figure 1. Predicted odds (circles) and 95% confidence intervals (horizontal bars) of experiencing pain and emotions during the menstrual cycle as a function of
hormonal contraceptive use, the phase of the menstrual cycle and the presence of a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Among non-users of hormonal contra-
ceptives (top panel, N = 624), (a) the odds of experiencing symptoms are higher (e.g. cramps, headache, tender breasts and sadness) or lower (i.e. happy) in the
late luteal phase (�3 days to the onset of menses), as compared to the early luteal phase (dashed line); (b) the presence of an infection is associated with an
increased odds of experiencing sensitive emotions throughout the luteal phase as compared with the absence of a STI (dashed line); (c) the odds of experiencing a
headache and sadness in the late luteal phase is higher for individuals with a STI (N = 40) as compared with individuals without a STI (dashed line). Among users of
hormonal contraceptives (bottom panel, N = 241), (d) the odds of experiencing sadness is lower in the late luteal phase as compared with the early luteal phase; (e)
the odds of experiencing any of the symptoms is not modified by the presence of a STI, as compared with the absence of a STI (dashed line); (f) the presence of a STI
decreases the odds of experiencing tender breasts in the late luteal phase

 infrequent, as is the case for STIs [23]. We find that, as predicted,
some premenstrual symptoms are exacerbated by the presence of
a STI among individuals who do not use hormonal contraceptives.
The results have implications for both understanding the role of
infection in modifying the premenstrual experience and using
digital health for understanding female’s health.
The results show that in the cycle prior to undergoing a test for a
sexually transmitted infection, individuals then diagnosed with
one or several infections are at increased odds of experiencing
headache, and a slightly longer period of cramps, before their
menses. Cramps and headache are common inflammatory symp-
toms [37] and thus the results are in line with the idea that cyclical
immunity enables STIs to grow and cause a heightened inflam-
matory reaction near the menses [23]. In addition, we found that
among STI positive individuals, the odds of experiencing head-
ache was reduced in the cycle just following diagnosis, but only in
the group of women who did not receive a medical prescription. In
this group, individuals were nearly all infected with human
papillomavirus (85%), of which most strains clear up spontan-
eously without treatment [38]. It is also not excluded that head-
aches were less reported because individuals were relieved to
learn that they were infected with HPV rather than with another
incurable pathogen. By contrast, in the group receiving a medical
prescription for the infection, individuals were mostly infected
with C.trachomatis and Herpes simplex virus and symptoms did
not improve in the cycle following treatment. It is likely that the
infection takes longer than one cycle to clear up, but then infor-
mation on the likelihood of reinfection in subsequent cycles would
be needed to investigate this scenario. The absence of improve-
ment could also partly be due to existing or rapid evolution of
resistance to antibiotics in the case of Chlamydia, or a low efficacy
of antiviral in the case of Herpes, and/or a counterproductive

 effect of anti-inflammatory medicine, preventing the normal body
defence to fight off the infection. Given different pathogens pre-
sent different prognosis (e.g. C.trachomatis is curable, Herpes sim-
plex virus is not), further research looking into infection-specific
effects over the long-term and using a larger sample size is war-
ranted to evaluate the impact of treatment on negative premen-
strual changes.
The results show that prior to diagnosis, the presence of an
infection is associated with both an exacerbation of sensitive emo-
tions throughout the luteal phase and sadness in the last 3 days of
the cycle. Those results are in line with previous studies docu-
menting a link between depression and C. trachomatis [23], or
depression and infections more generally [39]. However, the link
between ‘sensitive emotions’ and infection isnot stronger in the late
luteal phase, as compared with the early luteal phase, which might
indicate that an increased experience of sensitive emotions
among STI positive women is primarily driven by non-cyclical ef-
fects. For instance, individuals with an undiagnosed infection
might be aware of the possibility of being infected, leading to
low mood throughout the cycle. Indeed, in our sample, 60% of
STI positive individuals asked for a test compared to a routine
exam. It is also possible that the relationship is the other way
around, as it has been shown that individuals experiencing
chronic psychological stress are more susceptible to infectious
diseases [39]. Finally, the question of whether the association be-
tween STIs and the experience of sensitive emotions is similar
across various infectious diseases cannot be answered with our
data due to low sample size per type of infectious agent. We can-
not exclude the possibility that the relationship between sensitive
emotions and STI is driven by certain infections due to particular
immune-to-brain signalling pathways [40, 41].
A relationship between, on the one hand, psychological and
physical negative symptoms, and on the other hand, STIs, is gen-
erally not observed among users of hormonal contraception. This
was expected as progesterone levels do not cycle as much follow-
ing

 contraceptive users, an undiagnosed pathogen load is thus not
predicted to grow during the luteal phase of the cycle, and no or
little exacerbation of PMS symptoms is anticipated. Although the
use of hormonal methods of birth control is, in general, expected
to remove immune cyclicity, its effect on the immune system is
likely to be method-specific [42]. Given that information on the
type of hormonal contraceptives used isnot available in thisstudy,
it cannot be excluded that the absence of a relationship between
the presence of a STI and a negative premenstrual experience
among hormonal contraceptive users is characteristic of some
methods but not of others. In this sample, the main robust cor-

 breasts’ is caused by increases in oestrogen and progesterone in
the luteal phase, which cause an enlargement of milk ducts and
milk glands, respectively [45]. In contraceptive users, the peaks of
oestrogen (just before mid-cycle) and progesterone (around
21 days) of the cycle do not occur, preventing the occurrence of
breasts tenderness.
Limitations
This study makes use of digital health data, which presents both
advantages and limitations. On the one hand, it is possible to
access daily cycle data on a potentially large sample of individuals.
On the other hand, the data are self-reported, data entry is biased
towards specific days of the cycle, and the sample size reduces
considerably once the questionnaire is paired with retrospective
cycle data (the sample was reduced to 10% of its original size). In
addition, the sample is largely biased towards WEIRD women, i.e.
individuals from western, educated, industrialized, rich and
democratic countries [48], thus it is not possible to generalise
our findings to non-WEIRD populations. Note, however, that
Clue cannot be said to be biased toward heterosexual individuals
as, based on a recent representative and large survey of Clue users,
18% of individuals identify as bisexual/pansexual, lesbian/gay/
homosexual, or queer. Another limitation of our study is that only
two cycles were used, the one before the medical test and the one
after results, which is not sufficient given that significant hormo-
nal variation is found across cycles within women [49]. However,
limiting the analysis to those cycles was necessary given that
retrospective data do not inform on the exact timing of infection,
and whether or not individuals were re-infected after diagnosis.
Long-term prospective studies monitoring the clearing up of an
infection across several cycles is the next step for investigating the
link between infections and PMS. Further, it is not known whether
participants were tested for all possible STIs. Thus, it is possible
that some individuals received a negative diagnosis for some STIs
while being infected with other STIs without knowing it. If this is
the case with our data, then our ability to observe a difference
between STI positive and STI negative individuals is likely to have
been weakened, and thus the impact of STIs on negative premen-
strual symptoms might actually be stronger than that observed.
Finally, at the time of the study, the PMSx recorded in the app
could be seen to reproduce the ‘hetero-patriarchal discourse’
framing the lived experience of the pre-menstrual phase as a nega-
tive one [16]. Out of the six options for tracking PMSx, only the
‘happy’ option allowed individuals to record a positive experience.
This bias limits our ability to investigate the impact of infections
on positive premenstrual symptoms, for instance energy and cre-
ativity [15, 46]. To provide a more complete picture of the premen-
strual experience, apps should include more options for tracking
positive pre-menstrual feelings and behaviours [15, 47]. In this
line, the authors have started enquiring Clue users about their
positive symptoms [15].
This study investigated the evolutionary hypothesis that a nega-
tive premenstrual experience can be exacerbated by the presence
of a STI using digital health data from Western populations. The
analysis suggests that the presence of STIsdoincrease the odds of
experiencing headache,sadness and cramps pre-menstrually, and
sensitive emotions throughout the luteal phase. However, further
prospective work studying one pathogen at a time and using im-
munological data over several cycles is warranted to further our
understanding of the link between the pre-menstrual experience
and the occurrence of infections.
