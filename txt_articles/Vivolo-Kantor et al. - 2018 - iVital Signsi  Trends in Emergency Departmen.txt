Abstract
Introduction: From 2015 to 2016, opioid overdose deaths increased 27.7%, indicating a worsening of the opioid overdose 
epidemic and highlighting the importance of rapid data collection, analysis, and dissemination.
Methods: Emergency department (ED) syndromic and hospital billing data on opioid-involved overdoses during 
July 2016–September 2017 were examined. Temporal trends in opioid overdoses from 52 jurisdictions in 45 states were 
analyzed at the regional level and by demographic characteristics. To assess trends based on urban development, data 
from 16 states were analyzed by state and urbanization level.
Results: From July 2016 through September 2017, a total of 142,557 ED visits (15.7 per 10,000 visits) from 52 
jurisdictions in 45 states were suspected opioid-involved overdoses. This rate increased on average by 5.6% per quarter. 
Rates increased across demographic groups and all five U.S. regions, with largest increases in the Southwest, Midwest, and 
West (approximately 7%–11% per quarter). In 16 states, 119,198 ED visits (26.7 per 10,000 visits) were suspected opioid-
involved overdoses. Ten states (Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, 
and Wisconsin) experienced significant quarterly rate increases from third quarter 2016 to third quarter 2017, and in 
one state (Kentucky), rates decreased significantly. The highest rate increases occurred in large central metropolitan areas.
Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: With continued increases in opioid overdoses, availability 
of timely data is important to inform actions taken by EDs and public health practitioners. Increases in opioid overdoses 
varied by region and urbanization level, indicating a need for localized responses. Educating ED physicians and staff 
members about appropriate services for immediate care and treatment and implementing a post-overdose protocol that 
includes naloxone provision and linking persons into treatment could assist EDs with preventing overdose.
Introduction
The opioid overdose epidemic continues to worsen in the 
United States. In 2016, a total of 63,632 drug overdose deaths 
occurred, a 21.4% increase from 2015 (1,2). Nearly two thirds 
(66.4%) of drug overdose deaths in 2016 involved prescription 
opioids, illicit opioids, or both, an increase of 27.7% from 2015 
(2). Heroin and synthetic opioids (e.g., fentanyl) are driving 
increases in opioid-involved deaths (2–4). Tracking opioid 
overdoses is important to informing targeted interventions; 
however, timely national data on opioid overdoses evaluated in 
emergency departments (EDs) have been unavailable. Hospital 
billing data from 2014 indicate that approximately 92,000 ED 
visits occurred for unintentional, nonfatal opioid overdoses (5), 
but the time lag poses challenges to monitoring and response. 
ED syndromic data are important for tracking public health 
outbreaks (6) and can potentially identify changes in opioid 
overdoses quickly. Compared with billing data, syndromic 
data are collected in near real-time and can be viewed within 
24–48 hours of an ED visit. ED syndromic data can serve as 
an early warning system to alert communities to a rise in opi-
oid overdoses. Given the rapid availability of ED syndromic 
data, spikes in ED overdose trends are important to monitor 
and can potentially predict future fatal overdose trends and 
inform a more localized response. In addition, persons who 
experience an overdose are more likely to have a subsequent 
overdose (7); thus, EDs provide a crucial opportunity to link 
patients to treatment to avoid repeat overdoses. This report 
examines changes in opioid overdoses seen in the ED accord-
ing to regional, state, and urbanization levels, to identify and 
track opioid overdoses and inform response efforts and recom-
mendations for ED physicians and staff members.

Methods
ED visits* from CDC’s National Syndromic Surveillance 
Program (NSSP)† and Enhanced State Opioid Overdose 
Surveillance (ESOOS)§ program were analyzed to track 
trends in suspected unintentional or undetermined¶ opioid 
overdoses (opioid overdoses) by quarter and U.S. region 
(Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, West, and Midwest)** dur-
ing July 2016–September 2017. NSSP receives demographic 
and chief complaint data and International Classification of 
Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) 
diagnostic codes for approximately 60% of ED visits†† in 
the United States (8,9). Only visits involving patients aged 
≥11 years were analyzed because they account for the majority 
 * Emergency department visits are determined by considering facilities that are 
categorized as “emergency” and for patients who are deemed “emergency” 
status and excludes patients designated as only inpatient or only outpatient.
 † NSSP’s BioSense platform launched in 2003 to establish a national public 
health surveillance system for early detection and assessment of potential 
bioterrorism-related illness. It has expanded to track infectious diseases and 
injuries. https://www.cdc.gov/nssp/biosense/index.html.
 § Enhanced State Opioid Overdose Surveillance (ESOOS) (#CDC-RFA-CE16-1608) 
started in 2016 and now funds 32 states and the District of Columbia to increase 
the timeliness of all suspected nonfatal drug, opioid, and heroin opioid overdose 
reporting (e.g., emergency department); increase the timeliness and 
comprehensiveness of fatal opioid overdose reporting and associated risk factors; 
and disseminate findings to stakeholders working to prevent or respond to opioid-
involved overdoses. https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/foa/state-opioid-mm.html.
 ¶ Analyses were intended to include nonfatal opioid overdose visits with 
unintentional and undetermined intents. ED visits resulting in death were not 
excluded, but accounted for only 1% of total opioid overdose ED visits in 
ESSENCE during the study period (data not shown). Though not explicitly 
excluded, International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical 
Modification diagnosis codes or chief complaint text fields that mention 
intentional or assault-related opioid overdoses were not included because trends 
in unintentional overdoses are expected to differ from intentional overdoses. In 
addition, intentional opioid overdose is not as common as unintentional overdose. 
During 2006–2011, 26.5% of opioid overdoses were intentional; whereas, 53.5% 
and 20.0% were for unintentional and undetermined intents, respectively.
 
** Listed are the states within regions that currently share data with NSSP and 
had data available for the timeframe in this study. The Northeast region 
includes HHS Regions 1 (Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode 
Island, and Vermont), 2 (New Jersey and New York), and 3 (District of 
Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia); the 
Southeast region includes HHS Region 4 (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, 
Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee); the 
Southwest region includes HHS Region 6 (Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, 
and Texas); the Midwest region includes HHS Regions 5 (Indiana, Illinois, 
Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin) and 7 (Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, 
and Nebraska); and the West region includes HHS Regions 8 (Colorado, 
Montana, North Dakota, and Utah), 9 (Arizona, California, and Nevada) and 
10 (Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington). Some of the states listed above 
do not provide data for the entire state; for example, Texas (Region 6) has 
data from 50 counties; Iowa (Region 7) has data from one county; Colorado 
(Region 8) has data from three counties; and California (Region 9) has data 
from seven counties.
 
†† A 3–4 week delay usually occurs in the submission of discharge diagnosis 
codes that might affect the ability of the state case definitions to detect 
overdoses when free text information is unavailable or sparse. In addition, 
availability and completeness of data vary across the approximately 2,500 EDs 
with chief complaint text and discharge diagnosis codes missing in 15% and 
46% of ED visits in NSSP
, respectively.
of overdoses (2). NSSP ED data were analyzed using the 
Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of 
Community-based Epidemics (ESSENCE) software. ED vis-
its with ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes T40.0–T40.4, T40.6, 
T40.69, F11.12, F11.22, or F11.92; or chief complaint text 
indicating opioid use, “opioid,” and a word or abbreviation 
indicating an overdose (e.g., “OD”) were classified as suspected 
opioid overdoses.§§ To account for changes occurring across 
time and region, quarterly trends for the percentage of ED 
visits involving suspected opioid overdoses (ED visits involving 
opioid overdoses divided by total ED visits and multiplied by 
10,000) were analyzed and stratified by sex, age group, and U.S. 
region. Quarterly rate changes were calculated for all quarters. 
Yearly change, controlling for seasonal effects, was estimated 
as the change from third quarter 2016 to third quarter 2017. 
Significance testing was conducted using chi-square tests. 
Average linear quarterly percentage change was calculated for 
each strata using a joinpoint regression program.¶¶
Whereas NSSP includes syndromic data from a large number 
of states, the lowest level of aggregation is at the regional level, 
without additional approval from each state.*** Hence, ESOOS 
syndromic and hospital billing data were analyzed at the state 
and county level to identify suspected opioid overdoses during 
July 2016–September 2017 in 16 funded states (Delaware, 
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, 
New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, West Virginia, and Wisconsin), pro-
viding a more localized view. Three states used the NSSP suspected 
opioid overdose definition and 13 states developed their own 
definitions to capture the specific text and diagnoses used in their 
hospitals. Quarterly percentage change in rates are presented by 
state and county urbanization level††† and analyzed as described.
 §§ Additional information on the development of the opioid overdose case 
definition is available upon request to the corresponding author.

 *** State and local health departments using NSSP have access to their own 
detailed data (i.e., case-level data) and aggregate national and regional data 
and can share their detailed data with any other jurisdiction or CDC. CDC 
has access to all of the detailed data for operations and management purposes. 
In addition, for surveillance purposes, CDC can run queries against a subset 
of data elements and generate and report regional and national results. With 
approval, CDC also conducts collaborative analyses with jurisdictions and 
can access their detailed data. With ESOOS, states could allow CDC access 
to their data in NSSP for analysis in ESSENCE, or they could provide data 
(either syndromic or hospital billing) in different formats.
 ††† The six classification levels for counties were 1) large central metro: part of 
a metropolitan statistical area with ≥1 million population and covers a 
principal city; 2) large fringe metro: part of a metropolitan statistical area 
with ≥1 million population but does not cover a principal city; 3) medium 
metro: part of a metropolitan statistical area with ≥250,000 but <1 million 
population; 4) small metro: part of a metropolitan statistical area with 
<250,000 population; 5) micropolitan (nonmetro): part of a micropolitan 
statistical area (has an urban cluster of ≥10,000 but <50,000 population); 
and 6) noncore (nonmetro): not part of a metropolitan or micropolitan 
statistical area.

Results
Among approximately 91 million ED visits captured in 
NSSP during July 2016–September 2017, a total of 142,557 
(15.7 per 10,000 visits) were suspected opioid overdoses. 
Opioid overdose ED visits in NSSP increased 29.7% from 
third quarter 2016 (July–September) to third quarter 2017; all 
five U.S. regions experienced prevalence increases (Figure 1), 
with the largest in the Midwest (69.7%), followed by the 
West (40.3%), Northeast (21.3%), Southwest (20.2%), and 
Southeast (14.0%) (Table 1). Substantial increases occurred 
among all demographic groups during the same period, 
including males (30.2%), females (24.0%), and persons aged 
25–34 years (30.7%), 35–54 years (36.3%), and ≥55 years 
(31.9%). Most regions, age groups, and both sexes also expe-
rienced significant positive linear trends across all five quarters.
Among approximately 45 million ED visits reported by the 
16 ESOOS states from July 2016 through September 2017, a 
total of 119,198 (26.7 per 10,000 visits) were suspected opioid 
overdoses. Opioid overdose ED visits increased 34.5% from 
third quarter 2016 to third quarter 2017 (Table 2). Ten states 
experienced significant increases in prevalence during this 
period, although substantial variation was observed among 
states in the same region. For example, in the Northeast, signifi-
cant increases occurred in Delaware (105.0%), Pennsylvania 
(80.6%), and Maine (34.0%), but other states, including 
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island experienced 
nonsignificant (<10%) decreases. In the Southeast, a significant 
increase (31.1%) occurred in North Carolina, a significant 
decrease (15.0%) occurred in Kentucky, and a small, nonsig-
nificant decrease (5.3%) was observed in West Virginia. In the 
West, a significant increase (17.9%) occurred in Nevada. All 
states in the Midwest reported significant increases, including 
Wisconsin (108.6%), Illinois (65.5%), Indiana (35.1%), Ohio 
(27.7%), and Missouri (21.4%).
All urbanization levels experienced large and significant 
increases in ED opioid overdose visits from third quarter 2016

Discussion
Despite data from the 2016 National Survey on Drug Use 
and Health indicating that heroin use and opioid misuse might 
be stabilizing (10), this analysis suggests that prevalence of 
suspected opioid overdose ED visits substantially increased in 
NSSP (29.7%) and ESOOS (34.5%) states from third quarter 
2016 to third quarter 2017. Increases in ESOOS states were 
greater than those in NSSP states, which is likely driven by the 
higher mortality burden of drug overdose in ESOOS states (2). 
The increases occurred in most demographic groups and U.S. 
regions and suggest a worsening of the epidemic into late 2017 
in several states, possibly related to the wide variation in the 
availability and potency of illicit drug products (e.g., fentanyl 
sold as or mixed into heroin) that increase overdose risk and 
drive increases in mortality (3,4,11). Enhanced prevention 
and treatment efforts in the ED and access to evidence-based 
opioid use disorder treatment, including medication-assisted 
treatment and harm reduction services, are needed (12).
The sharp increases and variation across localities indicate that 
real-time data are needed to better detect and respond to over-
dose spikes and to facilitate response coordination for regional 
or multiple state outbreaks. Enhanced data sharing among 
contiguous localities is needed because regional variation in drug 
products often cross state or county borders (11). Increases in 
the Midwest in NSSP and all five Midwestern ESOOS states 
(Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin) are consistent 
with opioid overdose death trends (2). However, increases in 
prevalence of ED visits for suspected opioid overdoses in the 
Southwest and West and decreases in the Southeast (Kentucky 
and West Virginia) were unanticipated and might foreshadow 
changes in opioid overdose death trends in 2017. The signifi-
cant decreases in Kentucky might be explained by fluctuations 
in drug supply and warrant confirmation. In the Northeast, 
several states reported small decreases (Massachusetts, New 
Hampshire, and Rhode Island) or large increases (Delaware, 
Maine, and Pennsylvania) that are consistent with early 2017 
drug overdose death reports from these states,§§§ possibly related

The increases in opioid overdose rates in ESOOS metro-
politan counties, specifically in large central (54.1%), medium 
(42.6%), and small metropolitan (36.9%) counties from third 
quarter 2016 to third quarter 2017 are consistent with previous 
reports indicating that heroin overdose hospitalizations, ED 
visits, and deaths were highest in metropolitan areas (2–5). 
Two of the three areas with highest rates of heroin overdose 
deaths, large central metropolitan and medium metropolitan 
areas (2), reported the sharpest increases in opioid overdose ED 
visits, highlighting the need for targeted efforts to reduce the 
prevalence of opioid overdose in these areas and slow or reverse 
increases in overdoses driven by changes in the illicit opioid

and heroin use, however, only varies slightly across urbaniza-
tion levels, and all urbanization levels report increases in ED 
visits for opioid overdoses (5). Thus, generalized public health 
interventions tailored to each community context are necessary.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three 
limitations. First, NSSP and ESOOS case definitions might 
underestimate or overestimate opioid overdoses based on cod-
ing differences in hospitals, the availability of ICD-10-CM 
diagnostic codes, and the quality of chief complaint data (13). 
Consequently, analyses focused on comparison of trends by 
region and state, not of absolute rates. Findings should be verified 
against other data sources, and trends are expected to change 
slightly as visit data are updated. Second, hospital participation 
in NSSP varied across quarters; therefore, results could be related 
to changes in hospital participation. Finally, findings are not 
generalizable to areas not participating in NSSP or ESOOS.
With the rapidly evolving opioid overdose epidemic, ED data 
can serve as an early warning system, alerting communities to 
changes in prevalence of overdoses and permitting a timely, 
informed, and localized response that could facilitate a more 
rapid and coordinated response including targeting of resources

 † The six classification levels for counties were 1) large central metro: part of a metropolitan statistical area with ≥1 million population and covers a principal city; 
2) large fringe metro: part of a metropolitan statistical area with ≥1 million population but does not cover a principal city; 3) medium metro: part of a metropolitan 
statistical area with ≥250,000 but <1 million population; 4) small metro: part of a metropolitan statistical area with <250,000 population; 5) micropolitan (nonmetro): 
part of a micropolitan statistical area (has an urban cluster of ≥10,000 but <50,000 population); and 6) noncore (nonmetro): not part of a metropolitan or micropolitan 
statistical area.
 § The average linear quarterly percentage change (QPC) was significant for large central metro (average QPC = 11.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 10.7 to 12.7, p<.001). 
QPCs for large fringe metro (average QPC = 5.1, 95% CI = -0.3 to 10.7); medium metro (average QPC = 11.4, 95% CI = -1.3 to 25.8); small metro (average QPC = 9.3, 
95% CI = -0.1 to 19.5); micropolitan (average QPC = 6.4, 95% CI = -3.1 to 16.9); and noncore (average QPC = 6.4, 95% CI = -2.8 to 16.5) were not significant.

(e.g., increase naloxone supply to affected areas), and issuance 
of emergency health alerts or advisories. EDs also can serve as a 
point of intervention for persons who experience an overdose 
and are at higher risk for a subsequent overdose. Educating ED 
physicians and staff members about appropriate services for 
immediate care and treatment and post-overdose protocols are 
important to preventing future overdoses among their patients. 
ED physicians could assess history of prescription drug use dur-
ing care by accessing data from prescription drug monitoring 
programs and provide education to patients. Post-overdose 
protocols can help prevent subsequent overdose by providing 
naloxone and connecting patients with case management ser-
vices or peer navigators to help link them into treatment and 
harm reduction services, including syringe services programs 
(12). Opioid overdoses continue to increase in most jurisdic-
tions, and rapid response efforts and a multisectoral approach 
are needed to reduce and prevent overdoses and their associated 
morbidity and mortality.

Key Points
• During July 2016–September 2017, emergency 
department (ED) visits among those aged ≥11 years for 
opioid overdoses in the United States increased 29.7% 
overall and 34.5% in 16 states with high prevalence of 
overdose mortality. Significant rate increases were found 
in five Midwest region states (largest in Wisconsin 
[109%]) and in three Northeast region states (largest in 
Delaware [105%]); nonsignificant decreases (<10%) 
were found in three Northeast states. In the Southeast, 
rates increased in North Carolina (31%) and decreased 
in Kentucky (15.0%).
• Every demographic group reported substantial rate 
increases, including males (30%) and females (24%) 
and persons in all age groups (25–34 [31%]; 35–54 
[36%], and ≥55 [32%] years).
• The highest opioid overdose rate increases occurred 
in large central metropolitan areas (a population of 
≥1 million and covering a principal city).
• ED syndromic data can serve as an early warning system 
to alert communities of changes in opioid overdoses 
because of the rapid availability of this data (i.e., can be 
viewed within 24–48 hours of an ED visit).
• Treatment in EDs for drug overdose provides 
opportunities for intervention and prevention, which 
require coordination among all involved health care 
providers and agencies.
