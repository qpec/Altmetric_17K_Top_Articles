Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of neuro-
developmental disorders characterized by impaired social
interaction, communication deficits, and a range of restricted
and repetitive patterns of behavior.1 During the 30 years, the
prevalence of ASD has been on the rise in most Western
societies2,3 and has become a major public health concern in
the United States. According to the latest Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate, approximately 1 in 68
(14.7 per 1,000) 8-year-old children meet the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition
(DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria for ASD.4 It ranks among the
most common childhood chronic diseases that place a large

Abstract
Objective
To examine the association between exposures to perinatal factors and
autism spectrum disorders (ASD).
Study Design
A retrospective cohort study of ASD among children born in Kaiser
Permanente Southern California hospitals between 1991 and 2009 (n ¼ 594,638).
Medical records were used to determine exposure to perinatal (antepartum and
intrapartum) complications. ASD was diagnosed using DSM-IV criteria. Multivariable
Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs).
Result
Children with ASD were more likely to be exposed to perinatal complications
(HR ¼ 1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09–1.21) than neurotypical children.
Children exposed to antepartum (HR ¼ 1.22, 95% CI: 1.10–1.36) and intrapartum
(HR ¼ 1.10, 95% CI: 1.04–1.17) complications were at increased risk of ASD. The risk
was even greater when both antepartum and intrapartum conditions were present
(HR ¼ 1.44, 95% CI: 1.26–1.63).
Conclusion
Exposure to antepartum or intrapartum complications increases the risk
of ASD in the offspring. Therefore, pregnancy complications may help identify children
who could benefit from early screening and intervention for this common neuro-
developmental condition.

 burden on affected individuals, their families and the society.
A recent study by Buescher et al,5 it was estimated that the
mean annual aggregate costs of autism-related medical
expenditure and loss of family income and productivity are
as high as $138 billion.
Despite extensive research, the underlying pathoetiologic
mechanisms responsible for the development of ASD are un-
known. It has been postulated that it is a multifactorial disease
with genetic and environmental factors exerting their effects at a
critical period of brain development.6–8 Although fetal origin of
childhood disease is a well-established phenomenon, studies
investigating impact of conditions during fetal development on
ASD are limited9–11 and population-level data are scarce. Recent
research in this area has shown that exposure to preeclampsia12
and gestational diabetes13 increases the risk of ASD. Our recent
studydemonstratesthatexposureto ischemic-hypoxiccondition
in utero is associated with increased risk of attention deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), another neurodevelopmental
disorder.14 Although ASD and ADHD have distinct character-
istics, both have overlapping etiology, neurologic features, symp-
toms, and comorbidities.15–17
We hypothesize that underperfusion of the placenta and
obstetric complications that compromise blood flow to the
fetus may induce oxygen and vital nutrient deprivation as well
as generate toxic metabolites leading to damage and dysfunc-
tion of developing neurons.18–20 Thus, the present study was
undertaken to determine whether antepartum and intrapar-
tum pregnancy complications are associated with increased
risk of ASD independent of the gestational age at birth.
Furthermore, we also examined whether the magnitude of
any such association is modified by child’s race/ethnicity.
Materials and Methods
This study used a retrospective cohort approach to examine
the association between perinatal conditions and ASDs in
singleton live-born children delivered in a large health main-
tenance organization (Kaiser Permanente Southern California
[KPSC]). The KPSC system currently delivers approximately
36,000 babies annually at 14 Kaiser Permanente hospitals
located throughout southern California. This study was ap-
proved by the KPSC Institutional Review Board.
The medical records used for this study include perinatal
service system, maternal and child inpatient and outpatient
medical care, along with laboratory and pharmacy records.
Information extracted from the patient’s electronic medical
record include maternal medical and obstetric conditions and
procedures, fetal and neonatal outcomes of all birth in KPSC
hospitals, maternal sociodemographic and behavioral char-
acteristics, parental age and race/ethnicity, child’s age and
sex, as well as child medical history. Parental demographic
and maternal medical and obstetric health records were
linked to child records using medical record numbers unique
for each pregnancy. The validation of the linked data has been
reported in detail elsewhere.21–23
The study population was drawn from a total of 594,638
births between 1991 and 2009. To become eligible for inclu-
sion, children must have been born to KPSC-members in KPSC
hospitals between January 1, 1991 and December 31, 2009 be a
singleton birth with a gestational age of 280/7 through 426/7
weeks of gestation, born without congenital anomalies, and be
KPSC health plan members at least for 3 months between 3 and
17 years of age during 1993 and 2013. Births at < 280/7 weeks
of gestation were excluded because of their high incidence of
morbidity. After applying these criteria, the final population
consisted of 401,660 singleton, live born children (►Fig. 1).
Pregnancies were classified into three exposure groups based
on exposure to (1) antepartum complications, (2) intrapartum
complications,
(3)
or
both
antepartum
and
intrapartum
complications (►Table 1). Pregnancies complicated by antepar-
tum factors were defined by the presence of placental abruption
(International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical
Modification [ICD-9-CM] code 641.2x, 762.1) and preeclampsia
(ICD-9-CM codes 642.x).24,25 Intrapartum conditions consisted
of one or more of the following pregnancy complications:
breech/transverse presentation of the fetus (ICD-9-CM codes
652.2x, 652.3x, 669.6x, 763.0, 72.x), fetal dystocia (ICD-9-CM
codes 660.4x), prolapsed/nuchal cord (ICD-9-CM codes 762.4,
762.5, 73.92), and birth asphyxia (ICD-9-CM codes 768.x, which
included Apgar score <7 at 5 minute and neonatal resuscita-
tion).25–29 The validation of these clinical diagnosis codes has
been reported in detail elsewhere.21,22
The outcome variable was physician-diagnosed ASD in
children aged 3 to 17 years. The clinical diagnosis of ASD is
based on confirmation of ASD case consistent with the diag-
nostic criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR)
for any of thefollowing conditions: autistic disorder, childhood
disintegrative disorder, Rett disorder, Asperger disorder, or
pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified
(PDD-NOS) during the follow-up period by a child/adolescent
psychiatrist, developmental/behavioral pediatrician, child psy-
chologist, or neurologist. The accuracy of ASD diagnosis has
been validated by medical record review.30
Gestational age at delivery was based on a clinical esti-
mate. Potential confounders and effect modifiers that were
considered included child’s sex (male/female), census tract’s
estimated annual median family household income for each
year
(<
$29,999,
$30,000–$49,000,
$50,000–$69,999,
$70,000–$89,999, � $90,000), maternal age (< 20, 20–29,
30–34, � 35 years) and education (< 12, 12, � 13 years of
completed schooling), parity, prenatal care (first trimester
and none/late initiation), smoking (yes/no), year of diagnosis,
and psychosocial disorders during pregnancy ascertained
based on ICD-9-CM codes and medication use (yes/no). The
child’s race/ethnicity was based on maternal and paternal
race/ethnicity information and classified as non-Hispanic
white (white), non-Hispanic black (black), Hispanic, Asian/
Pacific islander, and Other/mixed racial ethnic groups. Chil-
dren of unknown/missing race were excluded from the study
due to insufficient data (< 3.3%).
Follow-up for children started from the date of delivery
and ended with an outcome (ASDs diagnosis) or when
censoring occurred, on the earliest of the following dates:
health plan disenrollment, 17th birthday, non-ASD–related
death, or end of study (December 31, 2013).

 Differences in maternal and child characteristics between
children with and without ASDs were compared using �2
tests. Cumulative incidence rates (CIRs) were estimated by
dividing the number of ASD cases by the person-years of
follow-up. Cox proportional hazard models31 were used to
estimate hazard ratios (HRs) describing the association
between perinatal risk factors and ASD before and after
controlling for potential confounding variables. To investigate
their independent effect, we examined the associations
between individual antepartum and intrapartum conditions
and ASD using hierarchical models that account for pregnan-
cies with more than one complication. If a woman had more
than one perinatal condition, only the first one in the hierar-
chical list was retained for the analysis. Therefore, perinatal
conditions were examined both individually and as part of a
cumulative risk index. Covariates included in the final model
were chosen based on a potential a priori relationship with
the exposure and outcome variables. Homogeneity of the HRs
across gestational age of delivery and child race/ethnicity was
evaluated by testing for significant interactions between
perinatal conditions and each of the covariate in the model
and stratified data analyses.
In pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia, the placenta
undergoes both histologic and morphologic changes impair-
ing placental function leading to chronic oxidative stress and
fetal hypoxemia.32 Although the placenta adapts well to the
hypoxic environment in preeclampsia, the compensatory
changes that take place to meet fetal growth requirements
are insufficient and generally persist throughout pregnancy.
Therefore, its influence on risk by the gestational age and
duration of in utero exposure (the number of days from first

birth)

 investigated. The diagnosis of ASD in children with accompa-
nying developmental and emotional disorders (mental retar-
dation,
developmental
dyslexia,
deficits
in
language
processing, conduct disorder, irritability, depressed mood,
bipolar or anxiety disorders) is challenging, and including this
group of children may, therefore, have affected our outcome.
To verify whether our findings still hold, we performed a
sensitivity analysis after excluding children with accompa-
nying developmental and emotional disorders. In all analyses,
children who were not exposed to any of listed perinatal
conditions were the reference group. Stratum-specific and
aggregated population-attributable risk fractions (PAF) were
estimated by PAF ¼ pdi ([HRi – 1]/HRi), where HRi is the
adjusted HR for the ith specific exposure and pdi is the
proportion of cases in the population from the ith exposure.33
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3
(SAS Institute, Cary, SC).
Results
During the time period examined, there were 6,255 children
born in KPSC hospitals that were diagnosed with ASDs
between the age of 3 and 17 years. Those who were not
diagnosed with ASD by 17 years formed the comparison
group (n ¼ 395,405; ►Fig. 1). The mean age at first diagnosis
of ASDs was approximately 6.2 years (SD ¼ 3.3). The median
follow-up times for children with and without exposure to
perinatal conditions were 4.9 and 10.6 years, respectively.
Characteristics of mothers and children by ASD status are
summarized in ►Table 2. ASD children’s mothers were more
likely to be older, have � 13 years of formal education,
nulliparous, to initiate prenatal care earlier, and have psy-
chosocial disorders during pregnancy. The rate of ASD diag-
nosis varied substantially by race/ethnicity, occurring most
frequently in non-Hispanic white children and least frequent-
ly in Asian children. ASD was diagnosed approximately four
times more frequently in boys (2.5%) as in girls (0.6%).
The incidence rate of ASD was significantly higher in
children exposed to perinatal conditions (1.70%) than unex-
posed children (1.28%, HR 1.31, 95% CI: 1.25–1.38; ►Table 3).
This association persisted after adjusting for potential con-
founding factors listed in ►Table 2. Further stratified analysis
indicated that both antepartum (HR 1.22, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.36)
and intrapartum (HR 1.10, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.17) conditions were
significantly associated with increased risk of childhood ASD.
The difference in the incidence rates of ASD were largely
attributed to higher incidence fetal malpresentation, births
asphyxia, and fetal dystocia from the intrapartum conditions
and preeclampsia from the antepartum conditions and the
coexisting of antepartum and intrapartum conditions in the
ASD group, while the incidence rate of placental abruption
was similar for ASD and non-ASD groups. The magnitude of
association is particularly greater when both antepartum and
intrapartum conditions occurred together in a pregnancy
(HR 1.44, 95% CI: 1.26, 1.64). The association between pro-
lapsed and nuchal cord and ASD became nonsignificant
(HR 1.03, 95% CI: 0.95, 1.12) after adjustment for confounders,
and we observed no association between placental abruption
and ASD. A stratified analysis by the duration of exposure to
preeclampsia revealed that children who were exposed to
preeclampsia for 2 to 7 days (HR 1.56, 95% CI: 1.25, 1.95),
and � 8 days (HR 1.59, 95% CI: 1.25, 2.02) were at signifi-
cantly increased risk of ASD compared with those children
who were not exposed to any of listed perinatal conditions. By
contrast, exposure to less than 24 hours had no detectible
association with ASD risk (HR 1.12, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.30). The
adjusted population fraction for ASD of having been exposed
to perinatal conditions was 0.3% while the corresponding
figures were 0.4% for exposure to antepartum conditions,
0.2% for exposure to intrapartum conditions, and 1.2% for
exposure to both antepartum and intrapartum conditions.
Preeclampsia confers an important risk factor for ASD regard-
less of the trimester in which diagnosis has been established
(data not shown). Furthermore, we conducted a sensitivity
analysis after excluding children with a history of accompa-
nying developmental and emotional disorders. The exclusion
of children with these comorbid factors did not produce any
significant changes in the magnitude and direction of the
associations (data not shown).
Significant differences in ASD incidence rate among pre-
term (1.76 per 1,000 person-years) and term (1.38 per 1,000
person-years) born children were found, regardless of expo-
sure status to perinatal conditions (incidence rate ratio [IRR]
1.24, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.35). However, the incidence rates of ASD
among preterm- and term-born children of pregnancies com-
plicated by perinatal conditions were 1.93 per 1,000 person-
years and 1.68 per 1,000 person-years, respectively (IRR 1.19,
95% CI: 1.09, 1.30). ►Fig. 2 shows the association between
exposures to perinatal conditions and the diagnosis of ASD at
preterm (28–36 weeks) and term (37–42 weeks) born children
after adjusting for several potential confounding factors,
including maternal age, education, parity, smoking, prenatal
care, year of diagnosis, psychosocial disorder during
preg-
nancy, and child’s sex and race/ethnicity. Children delivered at
term gestation and exposed to perinatal conditions were
significantly more likely to develop ASD later in life (HR
1.14, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.21) when compared with children who
were not exposed to any of listed conditions. At a preterm
birth, risk of ASD seemed to be elevated in children exposed to
most of studied perinatal conditions. However, the increase in
risk failed to reach statistical significance (►Fig. 2).
The race/ethnicity-specific incidence rates of ASD in exposed
and unexposed children and HRs for the association of perinatal
conditions with ASD, adjusted for potential confounders, are
shown in ►Table 4. With non-Hispanic whites as the reference,
the HRs for ASD were 0.89, 1.01, 0.90, and 1.03 for African
Americans, Hispanics, Asian/Pacific islanders, and Others/mixed
racial/ethnic groups, respectively. Exposure to antepartum and
intrapartum or both perinatal conditions were associated with
increased riskof ASD inwhite and black racial/ethnic groups. The
magnitude of the associations differed considerably by race and
ethnicity. Breech/transverse presentations, preeclampsia, and
diagnoses with exposure to both antepartum and intrapartum
conditions accounted for mostof the ASD diagnoses inwhite and
black racial/ethnic groups. Among Hispanics, significant associ-
ations were observed for birth asphyxia (HR 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7)

 and for birth asphyxia with Apgar score < 7 at 5 minutes (HR
2.6, 95% CI: 1.4, 4.6). Among Asian/Pacific islanders, significant
associations were observed for birth asphyxia requiring neonatal
resuscitation (HR 2.4, 95% CI: 1.0, 5.8) and for having more than
one intrapartum conditions (HR 2.1, 95% CI: 1.4, 3.1).
Discussion
The exact etiology of ASD remains uncertain. However, emerg-
ing evidence suggests that both genetic and environmental
factors play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Twin

 studies revealed that monozygotic twins are more strongly
concordant than dizygotic twin for ASDs.7,34,35 Furthermore,
human and animal studies have shown that maternal psycho-
social disorder,36 influenza infection, fever,37,38 environmental
toxin exposure,39 and diabetes13 are associated with increased
risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in the offspring. Previous
studies have also suggested that maternal smoking, a known
cause of fetal hypoxia, increases the risk of ASD. Therefore, we
hypothesized that children exposed to perinatal conditions and
obstetric complications that compromise blood flow to the fetal-
placental unit would be at greater risk for ASD.40,41
In this retrospective cohort study, we found that children
exposed to perinatal conditions were more likely to be
diagnosed with ASD than those who were not exposed. These
associations persisted after adjusting for potential confound-
ing variables that include maternal demographic and behav-
ioral characteristics, psychosocial disorder status, and child’s
sex and race/ethnicity. Furthermore, we found that exposure
to intrapartum conditions (birth asphyxia, breech/transverse
presentation, and fetal dystocia), preeclampsia, and exposure
to both antepartum and intrapartum conditions simulta-
neously to be significant risk factors for ASD at term birth,
but placental abruption was not associated with ASDs. Our
results also suggest that the risk of an ASD diagnosis between
3 and 17 years of age was proportional to the duration of
preeclampsia exposure. These findings support the hypothe-
sis that longer exposure to preeclampsia during early fetal life
may interfere with neurodevelopment at a critical stage of
fetal brain development that results in later behavioral dis-
orders. Most of the perinatal conditions-associated increase
in ASDs risk is attributable to exposure to birth asphyxia with
Apgar score < 7 at 5 minutes (46%), breech/transverse pre-
sentation (39%), and preeclampsia (26%). Although there is
evidence that perinatal conditions may be associated with
ASD, the population-attributable risk was small (PAF ¼ 0.3%),
suggesting that a preventive strategy to reduce studied
perinatal conditions would have minimal effects on reducing
ASD rates in our population.
The use of Apgar score as a standalone measure for
predicting future neurodevelopment outcomes is low. This
is because it can be affected by many other factors, such as
gestational age and maternal medications. However, the
Apgar score provides important information on the success
of a resuscitation effort. In the current study, we demonstrate
that, in children who had birth asphyxia, Apgar score < 7 at 5
minutes and resuscitation clearly are at increased risk of ASD.
A properly functioning placenta is crucial for fetal develop-
ment. Complications of the umbilical cord and a difficult birth
process may also compromise fetal blood circulation and injure
the developing brain in a manner that are not obvious at birth.
Although the etiology of preeclampsia is not fully understood,
it results in chronic oxidative stress and compromised fetal
circulation via uteroplacental underperfusion.32 Evidence
from animal models and humans42–46 and neuroimaging
studies in humans47–50 indicates that fetal exposure to hypoxia
results in marked brain structural changes that are consistent
with some of the neuroanatomical features of autism.50,51
These include decreased arborization of the cerebellum and
cortex, reduced numbers of Purkinje cells, strata oriens, and
pyramidal layer in the dorsal hippocampal regions.50,51

 Strengths of this study include use of a large cohort
representing the diverse population of southern California
and detailed medical records that enable us to control for
many confounding factors. KPSC’s integrated electronic med-
ical record system contains updated and detailed diagnosis
and treatment information on members receiving care in all
KPSC hospitals and outpatient clinics. The validity of clinical
diagnosis codes used for the exposure variables in this study
has been established by reviewing medical records as the gold
standard.21,22 Exposure data were recorded before onset/
diagnosis of ASD, avoiding potential differential selection
and recall biases.
The diagnosis of ASD was ascertained based on confirma-
tion of ASD case meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for ASD during
the follow-up period by a child/adolescent psychiatrists,
developmental/behavioral pediatricians, child psychologists,
or neurologists. In a preliminary analysis for related project,
96% of ADHD children were diagnosed by child/adolescent
psychiatrists, developmental/behavioral pediatricians, child
psychologists, or neurologists. Per KPSC guidelines (last re-
vised in April 2013),52 physicians perform behavioral and
developmental surveillance at all preventive care and well-
child checkup visits (as early as 4 months of life) to identify
children who may have developmental delays. Checklist for
ASD and developmental screening questionnaires are then
completed (as early as 18 months of life) to confirm diagnosis
by a specialist. This comprehensive approach limits the
potential for patient misclassification.
Previous studies were likely underpowered to study the
impact of fetal hypoxia on ASD and none looked at whether
risks differ by the child’s race/ethnicity, gestational age at
birth, or duration of exposure. Using data from the Childhood
Autism Risks from Genetics and the Environment study,
Walker et al12 found in their case-control study a 2.36-fold
(95% CI: 1.18, 4.68) increased risk of ASD in children exposed
in utero to preeclampsia. Although their finding is consistent
with ours, women with an autistic child may report pre-
eclampsia (a variable that was largely self-reported in their
study) more often than women without an autistic child. This
can bias results away from the null, a problem that was
avoided for the present study.
One limitation of our study is the use of patient self-
reported information on cigarette smoking during pregnancy.
However, Buka et al53 demonstrated significant agreement
between self-reported smoking and serum levels of cotinine,
a biomarker for exposure to tobacco smoke. The positive
predictive value that was 66% for preeclampsia diagnosis in
our validation study suggested possible misclassification of
the variable.21 Furthermore, some residual confounding is
possible due to unaccounted factors such as maternal anthro-
pometry54 and in utero exposure to environmental agents
such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs).55,56 Unfor-
tunately, these data were not available in the preelectronic
medical record era for our institution (1991–2006). Another
potential problem is surveillance bias related to the diagnosis
of ASD. This nonrandom type of information bias is likely to
occur if patients differ in likelihood of reporting a problem or
explain or describe their symptoms to their doctors.57
Making a definite diagnosis of ASD in children with accom-
panying developmental and emotional disorders (mental retar-
dation, developmental dyslexia, deficits in language processing,
conduct disorder, irritability, depressed mood, bipolar or anxiety
disorders) is challenging. Therefore, including children with
these comorbidities may have affected our findings. However,
when we limited the analysis to children with ASD but no other
accompanying developmental and emotional disorders, we
obtained similar results.
Our study suggests that perinatal conditions, especially
birth asphyxia and preeclampsia, are associated with increased
risk of childhood ASD even after accounting for gestational age
at delivery and other potential confounding factors. This study
raises the potential for early identification of at-risk children
who could benefit from further surveillance and interventions.
Early identification of at-risk children is critical, because early
intervention with behavioral and developmental therapy in
very young children with ASD can result in better long-term
cognitive and behavioral function.58,59
