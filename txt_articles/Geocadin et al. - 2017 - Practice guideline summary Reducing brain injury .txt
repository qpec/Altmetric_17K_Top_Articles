Practice guideline summary: Reducing brain injury
following cardiopulmonary resuscitation
Report of the Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation
Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology
ABSTRACT
Objective: To assess the evidence and make evidence-based recommendations for acute inter-
ventions to reduce brain injury in adult patients who are comatose after successful cardiopulmo-
nary resuscitation.
Methods: Published literature from 1966 to August 29, 2016, was reviewed with evidence-
based classification of relevant articles.
Results and recommendations: For patients who are comatose in whom the initial cardiac rhythm is
either pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) after out-of-hospital
cardiac arrest (OHCA), therapeutic hypothermia (TH; 32–348C for 24 hours) is highly likely to
be effective in improving functional neurologic outcome and survival compared with non-TH and
should be offered (Level A). For patients who are comatose in whom the initial cardiac rhythm is
either VT/VF or asystole/pulseless electrical activity (PEA) after OHCA, targeted temperature
management (368C for 24 hours, followed by 8 hours of rewarming to 378C, and temperature
maintenance below 37.58C until 72 hours) is likely as effective as TH and is an acceptable
alternative (Level B). For patients who are comatose with an initial rhythm of PEA/asystole, TH
possibly improves survival and functional neurologic outcome at discharge vs standard care and
may be offered (Level C). Prehospital cooling as an adjunct to TH is highly likely to be ineffective in
further improving neurologic outcome and survival and should not be offered (Level A). Other
pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies (applied with or without concomitant TH) are
also reviewed. Neurology® 2017;88:2141–2149

Outcomes for patients after nontraumatic cardiac
arrest are dismal. Only 6%–9.6% of all patients with
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survive to hos-
pital discharge,1,2 and an estimated 22.3% of patients
with in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) survive to hos-
pital discharge.3 Brain injury related to cardiac arrest
is a major determinant of mortality and disability.3
Until recently, the postresuscitation acute manage-
ment of survivors of cardiac arrest was directed mainly
toward systemic injuries, and acute neurologic care
focused mainly on prognostication, with supportive
care of neurologic complications. Recently, interest in
providing acute neuroprotective interventions has
surged, intent on improving survival and indepen-
dence of survivors.4

 interventions in adults who are comatose after suc-
cessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), with
particular attention on the outcomes of good neuro-
logic recovery, disability, and death. The full text of
the guideline is available as a data supplement at
Neurology.org. Appendices e-1 and e-2 and referen-
ces e1–e3, cited in this summary, are available in the
complete guideline.
The guideline addresses 3 questions:
1. In patients with nontraumatic cardiac arrest, does
induced mild therapeutic hypothermia (TH) or
targeted
temperature
management
(TTM)
improve outcome after CPR in adults who are
initially comatose?
2. In patients with nontraumatic cardiac arrest, do
putative neuroprotective drugs improve outcome
after CPR in adults who are initially comatose?
3. In patients with nontraumatic cardiac arrest, do
other medical interventions or combinations of
interventions improve outcome after CPR in
adults who are initially comatose?
DESCRIPTION OF THE ANALYTIC PROCESS The
American Academy of Neurology (AAN) convened
a panel of experts to develop this practice guideline
(appendices e-1 and e-2 of the full-length guideline)
according to the process outlined in the 2004 AAN
guideline development process manual.5 A descrip-
tion of the exact literature search strategy and the
process for reviewing evidence is available in the full-
length guideline. The recommendations are based on
Class I, II, and III studies (table e-1).
ANALYSIS OF EVIDENCE In patients with non-
traumatic cardiac arrest, does induced mild TH or TTM
improve outcome after CPR in adults who are initially
comatose? TH is defined as core body temperature of
32–348C and is achieved via various methods. Studies
are distinguished by patients’ type of initial cardiac
rhythm upon return of spontaneous circulation
(ROSC). Ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular
fibrillation (VF) is an indication for immediate car-
diac defibrillation (shockable rhythm), whereas asys-
tole and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) do not
require
electrical
intervention
(nonshockable
rhythm). Because these groups differ significantly
with respect to cause (PEA/asystole has numerous
noncardiac causes), outcomes (mortality rates are
higher in patients with PEA/asystole),4 and potential
response to TH, studies reporting outcomes sepa-
rately for patients presenting with VT/VF and PEA/
asystole are described preferentially for question 1.
Initial cardiac rhythm: VT/VF. Four Class I studies
provided TH (32–348C) to patients who were
comatose with VT/VF as the initial cardiac rhythm
after ROSC. The first study6 used the 5-point Cere-
bral Performance Category (CPC)7 as the primary
outcome, wherein 1 5 good recovery, 2 5 moderate
disability, 3 5 severe disability, 4 5 vegetative state,
and 5 5 death; this scale was also frequently used in
other identified studies in the guideline, though the
other studies in this section8–10 defined good outcome
differently. Results are summarized in table 1. No
differences in adverse events (AEs) between groups
were reported.
Conclusions and recommendations. For patients who are
comatose after an initial cardiac rhythm of VT/VF,
TH (32–348C for 24 hours) is highly likely to be
effective in improving neurologic outcome and sur-
vival compared with non-TH (2 Class I studies) and
should be offered (Level A).
For patients who are comatose with an initial
cardiac rhythm of either VT/VF or PEA/asystole,

 rewarming to 378C and temperature maintenance
below 37.58C until 72 hours) is likely as effective
as TH in improving neurologic outcome and sur-
vival (1 Class I study) and is an acceptable alter-
native to TH (Level B).
For patients who are comatose with an initial
rhythm of VF, there is insufficient evidence to support
or refute the use of 328C vs 348C TH because of lack
of statistical precision (Class III studies; Level U).
Clinical context. In the study investigating TTM,9
patients in both groups were cooled to achieve a target
temperature of either 338C or 368C. This study com-
pared 2 levels of cooling and should not be inter-
preted as comparing cooling with no cooling. Also
notable is that 72 hours of TTM is longer than the
TH periods in the other 2 studies (24 hours TH 1 8
hours rewarming6 and 12 hours TH 1 6 hours re-
warming8). Although the outcomes are considered
equivalent, differences in trial designs may have con-
tributed importantly to the outcomes. Previous stud-
ies6,8 focused on maintaining non-TH without
controlling for fever and allowed managing clinicians
to decide the manner and timing of prognostication
and withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies, whereas
the TTM study9 focused on fever control and pro-
vided a defined prognostication protocol resulting in
a longer observation period after active intervention.
Although the studies have emphasized temperature
and medical interventions, the timing of decisions
regarding withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies may
also affect outcomes. Despite the methodologic dif-
ferences between the TH and TTM trials, available
data strongly support the use of temperature control.
Initial cardiac rhythm: PEA/asystole. One Class I study
and 12 Class III studies examined induced mild
hypothermia
(32–348C)
in
patients
who
were
comatose with asystole/PEA after ROSC. In the Class
I TTM study mentioned previously,9 for those with
asystole/PEA, death occurred in 82/98 (84%) pa-
tients in the TH group and in 74/88 (84%) patients
in the TTM group (hazard ratio 1.08, 95% confi-
dence interval [CI] 0.79–1.48).
Class III study results are described in the full-
length guideline. Because many of these studies
lacked the statistical precision to drive conclusions
individually, 2 meta-analyses were performed. Seven
studies11–17 provided data on good neurologic out-
come. With use of a random-effects model, the pro-
portion of patients with a good neurologic outcome
was significantly higher when TH vs non-TH was
used (risk difference [RD] 6%, 95% CI 3%–9%,
I2 5 41). Five studies provided data on survival to
hospital discharge,11,13,14,17,18 3 of which showed
a benefit of TH on survival.11,14,17 With use of
a random-effects model, a significant benefit was seen
in the proportion of patients who survived to hospital
discharge for patients treated with TH vs non-TH
(RD 12%, 95% CI 8%–16%, I2 5 49).
Conclusions and recommendations. For patients who are
comatose in whom the initial rhythm is PEA/asystole,
treatment with TH vs non-TH possibly improves
functional neurologic outcome (RD 6%, 95% CI
3%–9%, I2 5 41; meta-analysis of 7 Class III stud-
ies) and survival (RD 12%, 95% CI 8%–16%, I2 5
49; meta-analysis of 5 Class III studies) at hospital
discharge and may be offered (Level C).
Prehospital cooling. The progression of neurologic
injury
after
the
initial
brain
insult
is
time-
dependent. Laboratory studies suggest that neuro-
logic injury is significantly decreased if cooling is
initiated as soon as possible after resuscitation.19–22
Five Class I studies and 1 Class II study investigated
optimal timing of TH induction after resuscitation,
full details of which are available in the complete
guideline.
One Class I study23 treated adults with any initial
cardiac rhythm after ROSC following OHCA with
prehospital administration of 2 L of 48C normal
saline or no prehospital cooling. In patients subse-
quently receiving in-hospital cooling (77% of VF
cohort and 57% of non-VF cohort), prehospital cool-
ing reduced the time to reach target temperature.
However, it did not improve survival or neurologic
status at hospital discharge in the VF group (RD for
survival to hospital discharge 2% favoring prehospital
cooling, 95% CI 210% to 6%; RD for minimal
neurologic impairment at discharge 24% favoring
no prehospital cooling, 95% CI 212% to 4%) or
the non-VF group (RD for survival to hospital dis-
charge 3% favoring prehospital cooling, 95% CI
22% to 8%; RD for minimal neurologic impairment
at discharge 1% favoring prehospital cooling, 95% CI
24% to 6%). The prehospital cooling group had
significantly higher rates of rearrest, lower oxygena-
tion, increased pulmonary edema on first chest x-ray,
and greater use of diuretics during the first 12 hours
of hospitalization.
Another Class I study24 included 200 patients
with no specified initial cardiac rhythm after wit-
nessed OHCA. Of the 37 patients presenting with
VF who survived to hospital admission, more pa-
tients receiving prehospital cooling (using an intra-
nasal cooling device) survived (RD 15% favoring
cooling, 95% CI 217% to 47%) and had a favor-
able outcome at discharge (RD 21% favoring pre-
hospital cooling, 95% CI 210% to 53%), but
results were not statistically significant. Similar re-
sults were observed in the 37 patients with PEA/
asystole surviving to hospital admission (RD for
survival: 11% favoring prehospital cooling, 95%
CI 215% to 37%; RD for favorable outcome at
discharge: 5% favoring prehospital cooling, 95%

 CI 220% to 29%). Small sample sizes limited sta-
tistical precision. Epistaxis (serious in one patient)
and nasal whitening were reported AEs of the intra-
nasal cooling device.
Another Class I study25 included 234 patients
with VF after OHCA treated with prehospital cool-
ing using 2 L of ice-cold Ringer lactate or no pre-
hospital cooling. All patients surviving to admission
received in-hospital cooling. A concurrent study26
used the same protocol in 163 patients with PEA/
asystole. In patients with VF, RDs favored the non-
treated (control) group with regard to favorable out-
come (RD 25%, 95% CI 218% to 8%) and
survival to hospital discharge (RD 26%, 95% CI
219% to 7%). In patients with PEA/asystole, RDs
favored prehospital cooling (RD for favorable out-
come 4% favoring prehospital cooling, 95% CI
26% to 13%; RD for survival to discharge 5%
favoring prehospital cooling, 95% CI 25% to
14%). No significant differences in AEs were found
between the groups in the VF study. AEs were not
reported in the PEA/asystole study.
Another Class I study27 (for the primary endpoint
of nasopharyngeal temperature at hospital admission)
randomized 43 patients to a prehospital cooling
group that received 148C Ringer solution with a tar-
get temperature of 338C or conventional fluid ther-
apy,
regardless
of
initial
rhythm,
and
with
postadmission hypothermia administered at the dis-
cretion of the treating physician. The primary end-
point was nasopharyngeal temperature on arrival to
the emergency department. Nasopharyngeal temper-
ature was lower at the time of admission in the cool-
ing group (34.1 6 0.98C vs 35.2 6 0.88C, p ,
0.001), but there was no benefit of prehospital cool-
ing on survival to discharge or favorable outcome at
discharge (all surviving patients had a favorable out-
come; 42% in prehospital cooling group vs 44% of
controls, RD 2.3%, 95% CI 227.0% to 31.3%).
The final Class I study28 included 245 patients
with any rhythm after OHCA. Patients were random-
ized to receive either intra-arrest TH with external
cooling and an infusion of cold saline or no preho-
spital cooling. All patients surviving to hospital
admission received in-hospital TH. There was no
benefit of intra-arrest TH on survival to discharge
(5.7% in intra-arrest TH group vs 4.1% of controls,
RD 1.6%, 95% CI 24.3% to 7.7%) or favorable
outcome at discharge (5.7% vs 3.3%, RD 2.4%,
95% CI 23.2% to 8.4%).
Conclusion and recommendation. For patients who are
comatose after cardiac arrest, prehospital cooling as
an adjunct to in-hospital cooling is highly likely to
be ineffective in further improving neurologic out-
come and survival (multiple Class I studies) and
should not be offered (level A).
Clinical context. Several clinical studies with varying
methodologies showed that prehospital cooling,
whether post-ROSC or intra-arrest, did not provide
additional neurologic benefit when added to in-
hospital cooling. The absence of a clear understand-
ing of the mechanisms by which hypothermia exerts
its neuroprotective effects limits the ability to identify
the most opportune time to initiate the intervention.
Studies comparing different cooling methods and protocol
use. Two Class III studies compared different invasive
vs superficial cooling methods.29,30 An additional
Class III study31 investigated the effect of a standard-
ized treatment protocol. Because single Class III stud-
ies cannot drive recommendations, details of these
studies are discussed only in the complete guideline.
Induced
mild
hypothermia
in
combination
with
pharmacologic options. A Class II study32 randomized 49
adults with OHCA and various initial rhythms to
receive 24 hours of either hypothermia (358C) plus
liquid coenzyme Q10 250 mg once, followed by 150
mg TID for 5 days, or hypothermia alone. Signifi-
cantly more patients receiving coenzyme Q10 sur-
vived to 3 months (RD 39%, 95% CI 13%–65%).
Survival to hospital discharge and good neurologic
status at 3 months were not significantly different
between groups. No significant AEs were reported.
A Class III study33 compared hypothermia plus
epoetin-a 40,000 U every 12 hours for 2 days with
hypothermia alone; this single Class III study cannot
drive recommendations and is discussed in the com-
plete guideline.
Conclusions and recommendations. In patients who are
comatose after OHCA, the addition of coenzyme
Q10 to TH possibly improves survival but not neu-
rologic status at 3 months (1 Class II study) and may
be offered (Level C).
Clinical context. The success of TH in post–cardiac
arrest brain injury is defined by improvement not only
in survival but also in survivors’ neurologic status,
leading to hope that agents or combinations of agents
will improve neurologic outcomes. When added to
TH, coenzyme Q10 showed survival benefit but not
improvement in neurologic status at 3 months. More
data are needed to define the role of coenzyme Q10.
In patients with nontraumatic cardiac arrest, do putative
neuroprotective drugs improve outcome after CPR in
adults who are initially comatose? Studies were identi-
fied investigating xenon gas,34 nimodipine,35 lidofla-
zine,36
selenium,37
thiopental,38
magnesium,39
diazepam,39 and corticosteroids40,e1 as putative neuro-
protective agents (table 2).
Conclusions and recommendations. In patients with
witnessed OHCA and VT/VF, there is insufficient
evidence to support or refute the routine clinical use
of xenon gas in addition to TH (Level U), as it

 probably results in less white matter damage as mea-
sured by fractional anisotropy, but the clinical impor-
tance of this is unknown and it probably does not
improve 6-month neurologic outcome as measured
by the CPC. In patients with OHCA, there is
insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of
nimodipine because of insufficient statistical pre-
cision (Level U). Lidoflazine is likely ineffective in
improving survival and neurologic outcome in this
population (1 Class I study) and should not be offered
(Level B). A single loading dose of thiopental is also
likely to be ineffective in improving survival or neu-
rologic outcome (1 Class I study) and should not be
offered (Level B). There is insufficient evidence to
support or refute the effectiveness of selenium (single
Class III study; Level U) or a single loading dose of
magnesium sulfate (1 Class I study with insufficient
statistical precision to exclude a meaningful benefit;
Level U). A single loading dose of diazepam is likely
ineffective in improving survival or awakening (Level
B). There is insufficient evidence to support or refute
corticosteroid use for improving survival or neuro-
logic outcome (1 Class II and 1 Class III study with
insufficient statistical precision to exclude a moderate
or large benefit; Level U).
Clinical context. To date, no neuroprotective drug has
been shown to be effective in improving survival or
neurologic outcome in patients who are comatose
after cardiac arrest. Furthermore, these agents may
have serious AEs. Currently none of these agents is
used routinely in clinical practice.
In patients with nontraumatic cardiac arrest, do other
medical interventions or combinations of interventions
improve outcome after CPR in adults who are initially
comatose?

 randomized 28 patients with ROSC after witnessed
OHCA (initial rhythm VF) to receive either 30% or
100% oxygen for 60 minutes followed by standard
care. There was no difference in survival (RD 0%,
95% CI 234% to 34%) or good neurologic outcome
(RD 14%, 95% CI 251% to 22%) at hospital dis-
charge, although the study lacked the statistical pre-
cision to exclude a potentially important effect.
High-volume hemofiltration. One Class I studye3 ran-
domized 61 patients with OHCA and any initial
rhythm to isovolumic high-volume hemofiltration
(HF) alone, HF combined with TH, or routine care.
There was no statistical difference in 6-month sur-
vival between groups (RD for HF vs controls 24.0%,
95% CI 25.5% to 48.2%, RD for HF plus hypo-
thermia vs controls 10.8%, 95% CI 216.4% to
35.1%). After adjustment for baseline characteristics,
including initial rhythm, a multivariate logistic
regression model showed an improved odds of sur-
vival using pooled HF data (OR for 6-month survival
4.4, 95% CI 1.1–16.6), but the CI included a lower
bound of uncertain clinical relevance.
Conclusions and recommendations. There is insufficient
evidence to support or refute the use of 100% oxygen
immediately postresuscitation (1 Class I study with
insufficient statistical precision to exclude a potentially
important clinical effect; Level U). There is also insuf-
ficient evidence to support or refute the use of isovo-
lumic high-volume HF (1 Class I study with
insufficient statistical precision for the primary anal-
ysis of 6-month survival and with a secondary logistic
regression model including a lower CI of uncertain
clinical relevance; Level U).
CLINICAL CONTEXT FOR ALL EVIDENCE Patients
who are comatose after successful resuscitation from
cardiac arrest require complex neurologic and medical
care in the critical care unit. Induced mild hypother-
mia has emerged as an effective therapy to improve
outcomes in patients with VT/VF as their initial
cardiac rhythm, but its role in patients with PEA/
asystole remains uncertain. Other aspects of TH
requiring further study include the optimal method
for inducing and maintaining TH, the ideal rate of
cooling, the optimal target temperature range, and
protocols for rewarming, many of which varied
between studies and which could explain some varia-
tion in results. No method has established superior-
ity, and clinicians need to understand existing
methods and technologies so they are better informed
when acquiring equipment and developing protocols.
Multiple brain-related complications such as
seizures, status epilepticus, myoclonus, and cere-
bral edema can occur in patients post arrest.
Although these conditions are believed to have
a large effect on prognostication and survivors’
quality of life, studies are too limited to offer
evidence-based treatment recommendations at this
time. In the absence of adequate evidence to pro-
vide a treatment recommendation, it is best to
consider prevailing local standards in the manage-
ment of these complications.
The guideline panel also notes that most of the
studies did not specifically address the effect of with-
drawal of life-sustaining therapies in their analyses
(table e-1). The effect of this practice on the outcome
of trials needs careful study. Finally, there is a great
need for further studies on methods of supplementing
TH protocols, such as extracorporeal membrane oxy-
genation (ECMO) and pharmacologic agents (e.g.,
xenon gas, where the most recent study had mixed
results).
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
The complexity of patient characteristics and the clin-
ical course after resuscitation from cardiac arrest need
to be addressed carefully in future research. Future
research questions may include the following:
1. What are the best assessment methods and out-
come measures to use? When is the best time to
use these methods and measures?
2. What is the beneficial effect of TH and TTM on
patients resuscitated from IHCA with all types of
initial cardiac rhythm?
3. What are optimal temperature settings (time ini-
tiating and reaching target temperature, rate of
rewarming, depth of target temperature [e.g.,
328C, 348C, 368C], duration of temperature
management [e.g., 12 hours, 24 hours, 48
hours]) to provide the best outcome?
4. What is the treatment window (time lapse after
ROSC) in which TTM will be most effective and
ineffective?
5. What is the role of fever control over days after
active TTM?
6. What strategies (e.g., ECMO, pharmacologic
agents) may provide benefit in addition to hypo-
thermia, and what is the effect of hypothermia
on the action of other putative neuroprotective
agents or interventions?
7. What is the best method of delivering hypother-
mia (external vs internal, global vs regional
cooling)?
8. What is the effect of aggressive management of
post–cardiac
arrest
neurologic
complications
(e.g., brain edema, seizures or seizure prophylaxis,
intracranial pressure elevation, and intensive care
unit–related complications) on outcomes?
9. What is the effect of aggressive management of
the etiology of cardiac arrest (e.g., myocardial
infarction) and aggressive management of other
systemic complications?

 10. How does the use of TH affect the ability to
prognosticate outcome in patients who are coma-
tose after cardiac arrest?
11. What is the role of TTM induced and main-
tained by pharmacologic means in patients who
are comatose after ROSC?
12. What is the role of biomarkers in the delivery and
maintenance of TTM and the effect of bio-
markers on prognostication?
13. What is the role of withdrawal of life-sustaining
therapies in the outcomes of studies related to
cardiac arrest resuscitation?
DISCLAIMER Clinical practice guidelines, practice
advisories, systematic reviews, and other guidance
published by the American Academy of Neurology
and its affiliates are assessments of current scientific
and clinical information provided as an educational
service. The information (1) should not be considered
inclusive of all proper treatments, methods of care, or
as a statement of the standard of care; (2) is not
continually updated and may not reflect the most
recent evidence (new evidence may emerge between
the time information is developed and when it is
published or read); (3) addresses only the questions
specifically identified; (4) does not mandate any
particular course of medical care; and (5) is not in-
tended to substitute for the independent professional
judgment of the treating provider, as the information
does not account for individual variation among pa-
tients. In all cases, the selected course of action should
be considered by the treating provider in the context
of treating the individual patient. Use of the infor-

CONFLICT OF INTEREST The American Academy
of Neurology is committed to producing indepen-
dent, critical, and truthful clinical practice guidelines
(CPGs). Significant efforts are made to minimize the
potential for conflicts of interest to influence the
recommendations of this CPG. To the extent possi-
ble, the AAN keeps separate those who have a finan-
cial stake in the success or failure of the products
appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the
guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained
from all authors and reviewed by an oversight com-
mittee prior to project initiation. AAN limits the
participation of authors with substantial conflicts of
interest. The AAN forbids commercial participation
in, or funding of, guideline projects. Drafts of the
guideline have been reviewed by at least 3 AAN
committees, a network of neurologists, Neurology peer
reviewers, and representatives from related fields. The
