Abstract
Malignant tumors shed DNA into the circulation. The transient half-life of circulating tumor
DNA (ctDNA) may afford the opportunity to diagnose, monitor recurrence, and evaluate
response to therapy solely through a non-invasive blood draw. However, detecting ctDNA
against the normally occurring background of cell-free DNA derived from healthy cells has
proven challenging, particularly in non-metastatic solid tumors. In this study, distinct differ-
ences in fragment length size between ctDNAs and normal cell-free DNA are defined.
Human ctDNA in rat plasma derived from human glioblastoma multiforme stem-like cells in
the rat brain and human hepatocellular carcinoma in the rat flank were found to have a
shorter principal fragment length than the background rat cell-free DNA (134–144 bp vs.
167 bp, respectively). Subsequently, a similar shift in the fragment length of ctDNA in
humans with melanoma and lung cancer was identified compared to healthy controls. Com-
parison of fragment lengths from cell-free DNA between a melanoma patient and healthy
controls found that the BRAF V600E mutant allele occurred more commonly at a shorter
fragment length than the fragment length of the wild-type allele (132–145 bp vs. 165 bp,
respectively). Moreover, size-selecting for shorter cell-free DNA fragment lengths substan-
tially increased the EGFR T790M mutant allele frequency in human lung cancer. These find-
ings provide compelling evidence that experimental or bioinformatic isolation of a specific
subset of fragment lengths from cell-free DNA may improve detection of ctDNA.
Author Summary
During cell death, DNA that is not contained within a membrane (i.e., cell-free DNA)
enters the circulation. Detecting cell-free DNA originating from solid tumors (i.e., circulat-
ing tumor DNA, ctDNA), particularly solid tumors that have not metastasized, has proven
challenging due to the relatively abundant background of normally occurring cell-free
DNA derived from healthy cells. Our study defines the subtle but distinct differences in

 fragment length between normal cell-free DNA and ctDNA from a variety of solid tumors.
Specifically, ctDNA was overall consistently shorter than the fragment length of normal
cell-free DNA. Subsequently, we showed that a size-selection for shorter cell-free DNA
fragments increased the proportion of ctDNA within a sample. These results provide com-
pelling evidence that development of techniques to isolate a subset of cell-free DNA con-
sistent with the ctDNA fragment lengths described in our study may substantially improve
detection of non-metastatic solid tumors. As such, our findings may have a direct impact
on the clinical utility of ctDNA for the non-invasive detection and diagnosis of solid
tumors (i.e., the “liquid biopsy”), monitoring tumor recurrence, and evaluating tumor
response to therapy.
Introduction
Increased quantity of cell-free DNA in the circulation has been associated with malignant solid
tumors [1]. Longitudinal studies have reported reductions in cell-free DNA quantity in
response to therapy and elevations associated with recurrence suggesting quantification of cell-
free DNA may be useful for monitoring disease status [2–4]. However, quantifying cell-free
DNA as a marker of disease and its extent has been limited. The quantity of cell-free DNA has
not correlated well with stage and histological subtype [5, 6]. In addition, large inter-subject
variations of cell-free DNA quantification have been described leading to overlap between
malignant disease, benign tumors, and healthy controls [7, 8]. Moreover, increased quantity of
cell-free DNA is non-specific to cancer and has been associated with other conditions such as
autoimmune disease and environmental exposures [9, 10]. Finally, except in patients with
advanced metastatic disease, tumor-derived cell-free DNA (i.e., circulating tumor DNA,
ctDNA) forms only a small minority of the cell-free DNA in circulation against a background
of fragments mostly derived from normal cells. Therefore, the quantification of cell-free DNA
alone is of little prognostic value.
As an alternative, detecting specific variants or mutational hotspots in ctDNA may have
important clinical implications in the shift towards personalized medicine for diagnosing and/
or monitoring malignancies. In lung cancer, EGFR mutations in ctDNA have been associated
with prognosis and utilized for determining therapy (e.g., activating mutations that confer sen-
sitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors) [11]. However, molecular ctDNA studies in a variety
tumor types have largely focused on advanced or metastatic disease in which ctDNA is more
readily detectable compared to localized disease [12]. Bettegowda et al. reported a substantial
reduction in detectability of ctDNA in localized disease compared to metastatic tumors for
breast, colon, pancreas, and gastroesophageal cancers [13]. Moreover, ctDNA from glioblas-
toma multiforme (GBM), a primary brain tumor associated with neovascularization and dis-
ruption of the blood-brain barrier, was undetectable [13]. This latter finding supports the
general perception that detection of ctDNA from non-metastatic solid tumors is particularly
challenging since GBM does not metastasize beyond the central nervous system.
Emerging approaches to improve detection of ctDNA include amplicon-based strategies in
colorectal cancer [14] and integrated digital error suppression during deep sequencing in lung
cancer [15]. While the latter methods seek to eliminate artifacts during sequencing to improve
bioinformatic analytic sensitivity of mutant allele detection, the former techniques exploit
apparent size differences between ctDNA and cell-free DNA. Specifically, previous amplicon-
based studies have shown that ctDNA is highly fragmented and occurs most commonly at a
size <100 bp, while normal cell-free DNA is proportionally more represented at a size >400

 bp [16]. In this study, we initially sought to determine the feasibility of detecting ctDNA associ-
ated with GBM by utilizing a xenograft tumor model to exploit genomic species differences to
separate ctDNA from the background host animal benign cell-free DNA. In so doing, we iden-
tified precise differences in fragment lengths between ctDNA and normal cell-free DNA,
which were more narrow and more consistent than previously described [16, 17]. In addition,
we found strong evidence of a 10 bp periodicity in ctDNA that was less prominent in normal
cell-free DNA. These observations led us to explore if similar findings were present in tumors
outside the brain and subsequently translated to cell-free DNA samples obtained from cancer
patients. Collectively, the results described herein demonstrate that the fractional selection of
cell-free DNA with a specific size range that is 20–50 bp shorter than the size of normal healthy
cell-free DNA may substantially enrich for ctDNA in human cancer.
Results
GBM Xenograft Model
Established human GBM stem-like cell lines (GBM4 and GBM8) [18, 19] were implanted in
the nude rat brain. Control animals underwent an identical surgical procedure and were inocu-
lated with medium only. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging techniques were imple-
mented on a 3T whole-body clinical scanner (Philips Achieva) to phenotype the tumors. Fast
bound-pool fraction imaging (FBFI), a method validated with histology to measure myelin
density and identify tumor associated disruption of normal brain tissues [20], was used to pro-
duce bound-pool fraction maps (f maps) to detect and differentiate between bulky and infiltra-
tive lesions. The variable flip angle method [21] was used to measure T1 relaxivity (R1 maps,
where R1 = 1/T1) before and after administration of gadolinium (gadopentetate dimeglumine,
Bayer HealthCare), an intravenous contrast agent that shortens T1 and identifies disruption of
the blood-brain barrier (i.e., hyperintense signal on post-contrast R1 maps relative to pre-con-
trast R1 maps). Our initial experiments found that GBM4 yielded small, focal, non-enhancing
lesions (Fig 1A and 1B, S1A and S1B Fig). In contrast, GBM8 produced heterogenous lesions
that ranged from large, well-circumscribed tumors with strong contrast enhancement (i.e. dis-
ruption of the blood-brain barrier) to infiltrative lesions with absent or minimal contrast
enhancement (Fig 1A and 1B, S1A and S1B Fig).
Characteristics of ctDNA Associated with GBM
Detection of human ctDNA associated with GBM4 was not greater than the control animals
(Fig 1C), which was attributable to the small tumor size and absence of blood-brain barrier dis-
ruption. Human ctDNA was detected in all animals implanted with GBM8 including infiltra-
tive lesions with absent (e.g., GBM83, Fig 1A and 1B) to minimal (e.g., GBM82, S1A and S1B
Fig) disruption of the blood-brain barrier (Fig 1C, S1C Fig). The percent human ctDNA in the
buffy coat, where some residual plasma remains present, appeared correlated with the fraction
in plasma, but much lower, indicating that neither intact tumor cells nor a high molecular
weight fraction of ctDNA were present in the circulation (Fig 1C). Unexpectedly, there was a
precise difference in fragment length between human ctDNA and rat cell-free DNA. The most
common fragment lengths in human ctDNA were 134 bp and 144 bp (Fig 1D, S1D Fig), which
was in contrast to the most common fragment length of 167 bp in rat cell-free DNA (Fig 1F).
Human ctDNA fragment lengths also exhibited a strong ~10 bp periodicity that was not as evi-
dent in the rat cell-free DNA. This pattern was consistent across all animals where human
ctDNA was detected (Fig 1E).
To determine if the fragment length and periodicity extended beyond the GBM8 cell line,
nude rats were again implanted with either GBM4 or GBM8. Animals implanted with GBM4

 were serially imaged until the presence of blood-brain barrier disruption was evident (i.e., con-
trast-enhancement on MRI) or animals lost more than 10% bodyweight. As before, GBM8 ani-
mals developed tumors that were large and exhibited a range of phenotypes (Fig 2A and S2
Fig). Fragment length and periodicity was consistent with that present in the initial experiment
(Fig 2C). After a post-surgical interval nearly twice as long as GBM8, GBM4 tumors developed
(Fig 2 and S2 Fig). GBM4 tumors tended to grow more anteriorly towards the olfactory bulbs,
which led to weight loss in animals before tumor size was similar to GBM8. In a single animal
implanted with GBM4, ctDNA was adequately detected and a similar fragment length and
periodicity as seen with GBM8 was identified (Fig 2C).
Detection of ctDNA in a Xenograft Model of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
To evaluate the role of both GBM and the blood-brain barrier in determining fragment length
and periodicity, human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Hep G2) were implanted subcutane-
ously in the flank of three nude rats. A palpable tumor (approximately 10 mm at maximal
diameter), confirmed with histology, formed in a single animal (Fig 2D). The fragment length
of ctDNA was consistent with that described in GBM4 and GBM8 (Fig 2E). There was evidence
for a similar periodicity, but the relatively low amount of detected ctDNA may have contrib-
uted to a noisier distribution of fragment size. Regardless, the replication of results in a xeno-
graft model of hepatocellular carcinoma suggested that the periodicity and reduced fragment
length of ctDNA may be general properties of ctDNAs in cancers beyond GBM.
Characteristics of Cell-Free DNA and ctDNA in Human Melanoma
We next considered the effects of the xenograft model on ctDNA fragment length and period-
icity and sought to determine if evidence of the observed differences in fragment length were
present in other types of solid tumors such as melanoma. In contrast to the xenograft models,
the cell-free DNA from tumor patients represented an indistinguishable mix of both ctDNA
and cell-free DNA derived from normal healthy cells. By densitometry (TapeStation 2200), the
cell-free DNA from melanoma patients had globally shorter fragment lengths compared to
healthy controls (Fig 3A).
Potential differences in fragment length size between tumor patients and healthy controls
were explored by sequencing the cell-free DNA from a melanoma patient with an elevated con-
centration of cell-free DNA (36.4 ng/mL plasma; Fig 3A, black arrow) to obtain a large sample
for comparison to sequencing results from a pooled sample of control cell-free DNA. The most
common fragment length in the melanoma patient was shorter than the most common frag-
ment length in the control sample (145 bp vs. 165 bp, respectively; Fig 3B). There was also evi-
dence for more pronounced fragment length periodicity in the cell-free DNA from the
melanoma patient (Fig 3B). In the melanoma patient cell-free DNA, the BRAF V600E allele fre-
quency was increased at shorter fragment lengths compared to the WT allele (Fig 3C). Of note,
the broad distribution of the WT allele (Fig 3C, blue line) included a substantial proportion of
overlapping fragment sizes with the mutant allele since the BRAF V600E mutation is heterozy-
gous and tumor cells also introduced shorter fragment lengths into the circulation with the
WT allele. Subsequently, fragment length for the melanoma patient and the healthy volunteer
were binned (e.g. 50 = 50–59 bp; 60 = 60–69 bp, etc.) and the frequency of mutant allele and
invasion into the ventricle as identified on histology (B, black box). GBM84 is a large bulky tumor with disruption of the blood-brain barrier (A). Human
ctDNA was detected at a level above the control animals for all GBM8 tumors (C). Fragment length distribution for rat cell-free DNA (green line) and
human ctDNA (blue line) inferred from paired-end sequencing are plotted in D. All detected ctDNA demonstrated the same strong periodicity and
shorter fragment length compared to rat cell-free DNA (E). Distribution of normal rat cell-free DNA was largely consistent between animals (F).

 WT allele was determined, respectively. For a given fragment length, the proportion of the
V600E BRAF allele to the WT allele was highest in the 110–140 bp fragment length, which was
in contrast to the WT allele in the pooled healthy control sample that occurred at the highest
frequency between 160–180 bp (Fig 3D). Importantly, there were limited observations of
ctDNA fragments <100 bp in the melanoma patient (Fig 3D, black line), which were likely
present but not well recovered by current approaches to library preparation [22]. These collec-
tive findings indicated an overall shortening of ctDNA fragment size relative to cell-free DNA
that was not an effect of the xenograft model, but rather inherent to ctDNAs across different
tumor types.
Characteristics of Cell-Free DNA and ctDNA in Human Lung Cancer
We then sought to characterize tumor-related differences in cell-free DNA and ctDNA associ-
ated with human lung cancer. A comparison of cell-free DNA from 15 lung cancer patients
Fig 2. The ctDNA from GBM4 and hepatocellular carcinoma have a similar shortening of fragment length as GBM8. GBM44 is a small tumor
(A, white arrow) confirmed on histology (B, black box) with evidence of a disrupted blood-brain barrier by presence of contrast enhancement on post-
contrast R1 maps. The fragment length and periodicity seen previously in GBM8 (Fig 1) are also present in GBM4 (C), which also replicates in new
animals with GBM8, as shown in GBM86 and GBM87. Histology from an animal implanted with human hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep G2 cells) in the
flank identified a highly vascular tumor (D). The ctDNA from human hepatocellular carcinoma had a similar fragment length (E) that was seen in the
GBM tumors suggesting that the observed differences in fragment length were not secondary to effects of the blood-brain barrier or specific to GBM.

 and 9 healthy controls found a statistically significant difference in plasma concentration of
cell-free DNA (31.0±23.3 vs. 11.3±4.6 ng mL/plasma, p = 0.006; respectively); however, the
range of concentration in tumor patients was broad and overlapped with the concentrations
present in healthy controls (S3 Fig). Libraries made with duplex truncated molecular barcoded
adapters, which added ~99 bp to each strand of cell-free DNA, were created to enable loading
of a consistent concentration (2 ng/μL) of each sample and clear identification of upper/lower
markers for direct comparison of densitometry data (TapeStation 2200; S4 Fig). Consistent
with our observation in melanoma patients, peak fragment length by densitometry was
Fig 3. The cell-free DNA and ctDNA from melanoma patients consisted of shorter fragments than the healthy controls and the WT allele
fragments. In A, the relative fragment length of cell-free DNA obtained from melanoma patients with and without metastatic disease (± lymph node,
LN; A) tended to be shorter by densitometry compared to cell-free DNA from four healthy controls (A, gray lines). In B, the fragment lengths derived
from cell-free DNA deep-sequencing in a patient with melanoma (A, black arrow) were generally shorter than the fragment lengths present in the pool
of healthy controls (green and purple lines, respectively). (C) In the melanoma patient, cell-free DNA fragment lengths containing the mutant allele
(BRAF V600E, red line) were shorter compared to the fragment lengths containing the wild-type (WT) allele (blue line). In the shorter fragments there
was general overlap between the mutant and WT allele sizes since the BRAF V600E mutation is heterozygous. (D) Fragment lengths between 110–
140 bp had the highest proportion of the mutant allele (D, red solid line; the mutant allele frequency <100 bp was erratic due to few observations). In D,
the solid black line represents the overall frequency for each range of fragment lengths in the melanoma patient and indicates that there may be
insufficient amount of DNA for detecting mutant alleles below 100 bp. Of note, the WT allele from the healthy control occurred more commonly
between 160–180 bp (D, blue dashed line).

 significantly shorter compared to healthy controls (277.0±4.7 vs. 283.7±4.1 bp, p = 0.002;
respectively; S3B Fig) indicating a global shift towards smaller fragments in lung cancer
patients. However, there was also considerable overlap of peak fragment length between tumor
patients and controls (S3B Fig). There was not an association between peak fragment length by
densitometry and plasma concentration of cell-free DNA in the lung cancer patients (Pearson’s
r = –0.20, p = 0.47; Fig 4C) or the healthy controls (Pearson’s r = 0.19, p = 0.63; S3C Fig).
For a subset of samples (tumor, N = 7; control N = 5), cell-free DNA was converted to Illu-
mina sequencing libraries and enriched for cancer-relevant genes using a 16-gene capture
panel. Utilizing fragment lengths from the complete 16 gene capture panel, we observed that
the cell-free DNA from tumor patients ranged from a shorter fragment length with (Fig 4A)
and without (Fig 4B and S5A–S5D Fig) a strong periodicity to indistinguishable (Fig 4C and
S5E–S5G Fig) in fragment length distribution from healthy controls. Cell-free DNA from the
tumor patients did not exhibit a fragment length larger than the controls (S5 Fig), which was
consistent with densitometry (S3B Fig).
Cell-free DNA from two lung cancer patients (LC5 and LC10) contained the classic EGFR
L858R mutation [23]. Fragments containing the mutant allele, which originate from the tumor
rather than from breakdown of normal cells, were shorter than those bearing the WT allele in
healthy controls (Fig 4D). This difference was especially pronounced in one sample (LC5;
Fig 4E) with a relatively high mutant allele frequency (74.6%; likely due to EGFR amplification,
S6 Fig).
Cell-free DNA from six of the lung cancer patients contained the EGFR T790M mutation.
In 5 out of 6 patients, the mutant allele frequency was relatively low (0.2–6.6%). However, the
general trend in these samples was for mutant alleles to occur at shorter fragment lengths (Fig
4F). In one sample (LC9) with a relatively high mutant allele frequency (25.1%; most likely due
to an EGFR amplification, S5 Fig) the mutant allele more commonly occurred at shorter frag-
ment lengths compared to the fragment lengths from healthy controls (Fig 4G). The distribu-
tion of fragment lengths of the EGFR WT allele between tumor patients and healthy controls
largely reflected differences seen in S5 Fig, although noisier due to fewer total reads (S7 Fig).
Within each lung cancer patient with the mutant T790M allele, comparison of the distribution
of the EGFR WT allele and the mutant T790M allele fragment lengths identified a general
trend for the mutant allele to occur more commonly at shorter fragment lengths (Fig 4H). As
with the melanoma patient (Fig 4C), fragment length analysis of the WT allele from tumor
patients included an indistinguishable mixture of ctDNA and normal cell-free DNA since the
mutant T790M allele is heterozygous. As such, the representative WT allele fragment length
distribution from tumor patients included WT alleles derived from tumor cells. This observa-
tion may explain, at least in part, why the differences in fragment length between the WT
allele and the mutant T790M allele presented in Fig 4H were less pronounced than differences
observed between the WT allele from healthy controls and the mutant T790M allele shown in
Fig 4F.
Cell-Free DNA Fraction Selection for Mutant Allele Enrichment in
Human Lung Cancer
We next set out to determine whether selection for shorter fragment lengths could be used to
enrich for ctDNA fragments against the large background of cell-free DNA derived from nor-
mal cells. Cell-free DNA sequencing libraries from four lung cancer patients (LC1, LC3, LC4,
and LC10) with EGFR T790M mutations and one healthy control (C5) were selected for serial
fraction collection. By sequencing, LC1 and LC3 had EGFR T790M mutant allele frequencies
of 1.2% and 6.6%, respectively, and evidence of overall shorter cell-free DNA fragments

strong left shift (i.e., shorter fragment lengths) and periodicity in LC5 compared to controls (A). In B, there was a subtle shift
towards shorter fragment length that was most apparent at longer lengths (black arrow) where fewer inserts from the tumor

 compared to healthy controls (Fig 4B and S5B Fig, respectively). LC4 and LC10 had EGFR
T790M mutant allele frequencies of 2.3% and 1.7%, respectively, and a similar size distribution
of cell-free DNA fragments compared to healthy controls (S5G Fig and Fig 4C, respectively).
None of the samples had an EGFR amplification present (S6 Fig). For each sample, 1 μg of
sequencing library was loaded onto an 8% native polyacrylamide gel and six adjacent gel frag-
ments were collected (S8 Fig). Extracted DNA (5–10 ng) from each gel fragment was then
amplified using the full-length adapter primer and the EGFR T790M mutant allele frequency
was determined via digital droplet PCR (Fig 5).
Compared to the mutant allele frequency in the library, three samples (LC1, LC4, and
LC10) demonstrated a 2.5-fold to 9.1-fold increase in the mutant allele frequency in a subset of
fractions that contained a shorter distribution of cell-free DNA fragments relative to the peak
fragment length in the library (Fig 6 and S9–S11 Figs). The fraction associated with the greatest
increase in mutant allele frequency for each tumor patient is identified in Fig 6A–6C. In one
sample (LC1), the mutant allele frequency did not increase in any fraction relative to the
mutant allele frequency in the library (S12 Fig). However, a decrease in the mutant allele fre-
quency was observed in fractions containing longer fragments, while fractions with shorter
fragments contained a relatively consistent mutant allele frequency (Fig 6D and S12 Fig).
Enrichment for the mutant allele was greatest in fractions that were centered approximately
20–50 bp shorter than the peak fragment length associated with each corresponding library
(Fig 6E). The increase in mutant allele frequency was greatest in LC10 (Fig 5 and S11 Fig) and
LC4 (S10 Fig), which were the two tumor patients with a similar fragment size distribution pro-
file as that seen in the healthy controls (Fig 4C and S5G Fig, respectively). This finding suggests
that the fractional selection of shorter cell-free DNA fragment lengths may improve mutant
allele sensitivity when ctDNA is not the predominant component of cell-free DNA. Also nota-
ble is that the percentage of mutant allele detected in a sample low in ctDNA prior to enrich-
ment may not represent the true allele frequency present in the tumor due to dilution by
normal cell-free DNA. In LC1 (S12 Fig) and LC3 (S9 Fig), the tumor patients with evidence of
overall shorter cell-free DNA fragments compared to healthy controls, the increase in mutant
allele frequency in fractions 20–50 bp shorter than the peak fragment length associated with
each library was not as substantial; however, selecting these fractions also did not diminish the
mutant allele frequency (Fig 6E). In contrast, the selection of fractions longer than the library’s
peak fragment length substantially reduced the mutant allele frequency in three of the tumor
samples (LC1, LC4, and LC10; Fig 6E and S10–S12 Figs). Similarly, the selection of fractions
containing cell-free DNA fragments >50 bp shorter than the library’s peak fragment length
patient (LC1) were present compared to the healthy controls. In C, no difference between the tumor patient (LC10) and the
healthy controls was observed. In D, the length of fragments containing the WT or mutant EGFR allele is shown for healthy
controls (blue dots) and tumor patients with the mutant L858R allele (orange dots). The solid bars indicate the mean fragment
length for each sample. In E, a histogram of the fragment lengths of the mutant L858R allele from LC5 (orange line) vs. the WT
allele in healthy controls (blue lines) demonstrates a higher prevalence of mutant allele at shorter fragment lengths. The black
dashed-line identifies the fragment length that corresponds to the most inserts in the tumor patient. Note that the mutant allele
more commonly occurs at shorter fragment lengths while the WT allele in healthy controls occurs more commonly at longer
fragment lengths. In F, the fragment length associated with EGFR for the WT allele in the healthy controls (blue dots) and
tumor patients with the mutant T790M allele (red dots) is displayed. The solid bars correspond to mean fragment length for
each sample. In G, a histogram of the fragment length of the mutant allele (L858R) from LC9 (red line) vs. the WT allele in
healthy controls (blue lines) is shown. The black dashed-line identifies the fragment length that corresponds to the most
inserts in the tumor patient. Note that the WT allele in healthy controls more commonly occurs at longer fragment lengths. In H,
the EGFR fragment length associated with the WT allele (pink dots) and the mutant T790M allele (MA; red dots) in each of the
tumor patients are depicted. The mutant allele more commonly occurred at a shorter fragment length compared to the length
of the WT allele within the same patient.

 reduced the mutant allele frequency in all of the samples (Fig 6E). This latter observation may
be a consequence of recovery during library preparation as discussed earlier (Fig 3D) [22].
Regardless, these observations provide compelling evidence that the fragment length of ctDNA
is shorter than cell-free DNA from healthy cells and selection of shorter cell-free DNA frag-
ments may improve mutant allele frequency. Of note, the EGFR T790M mutant allele was not
present above the noise level associated with digital droplet PCR in the fractions obtained from
the control sample (S13 Fig).

excised from the gel corresponding to the colored boxes. In B, densitometry of the full-length libraries made from each fraction and the original library
are shown. Colors of each curve and peak correspond to the colors in A (the library is shown in black). In C, the mutant allele frequency as determined
by digital droplet PCR is shown for the library and each fraction. Colors for mutant allele frequency (%) correspond to the colors in A and B. Note that
the purple fraction (peak fragment length of 320 bp) represented the largest increase (9.1-fold) in mutant allele frequency compared to the library
(peak fragment length of 348 bp). Fractions containing longer fragment lengths than the library (e.g., blue fraction: peak fragment lengths of 361 bp)
demonstrated a reduction in mutant allele frequency.

 Discussion
Our broad observation that the fragment length of ctDNA differs from cell-free DNA is sup-
ported by earlier reports that utilized amplicons of varying length to identify large categorical
size differences between ctDNA associated with colorectal cancer and cell-free DNA from
healthy controls [16, 24]. In addition, deep sequencing has been previously used to identify
ctDNA shortening in hepatocellular carcinomas with specific aneuplodies [17]. However, this
latter study also identified fragment lengths larger than healthy controls associated with low
ctDNA concentrations in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma which is difficult to reconcile
[17]. The collective findings described in our study builds upon these previous works by utiliz-
ing massively parallel sequencing to define distinct differences in fragment length between
ctDNA and cell-free DNA. Specifically, animal models of GBM and hepatocellular carcinoma
found that the most common fragment lengths of ctDNA were 134 and 144 bp, which was in
contrast to the most common 167 bp fragment length present in normal cell-free DNA. These
findings replicated in human patients with melanoma. Moreover, selection of cell-free DNA
fractions containing shorter fragment lengths substantially increased mutant allele frequency
in human lung cancer patients, particularly when the distribution of cell-free DNA fragment
lengths in tumor patients was similar to the distribution seen in healthy controls. As such, the
findings described herein provide strong evidence that a more general process that shortens
ctDNA fragment length relative to normal cell-free DNA from healthy cells is present and is
independent of copy number alterations.
The overall distribution of fragment lengths identified for ctDNA and cell-free DNA in our
study was consistent with cellular apoptosis rather than necrosis [25]. In addition, the observed
~10 bp periodicity has been well-described in association with nuclease-cleaved nucleosome
activity [26]. However, the etiology of the shorter fragment length associated with ctDNA
remains unclear. Lo et al. previously reported similar findings from maternal serum with
regards to fragment length differences between fetal cell-free DNA and maternal cell-free DNA
[27]. Differences in cell-free DNA fragment lengths between donor-derived and host cell-free
DNA in organ transplant patients has also been observed [28]. The extent of cell-free DNA
shortening across disparate tissue contexts, in health and disease, suggests that tissue-specific
processes may contribute to certain cell-free DNA fragment length sub-populations. One plau-
sible hypothesis is that tissue-specific differences in nucleosome wrapping [29] result in frag-
ment lengths that differ between hematopoietic cells (which contribute the majority of the
plasma cell-free DNA) and other tissues of origin. Understanding the specific mechanism
behind this phenomenon may prove valuable in oncology. Regardless of etiology, enriching for
a specific subset of cell-free DNA fragment lengths may improve detection of ctDNA associ-
ated with non-metastatic solid tumors. More sensitive detection of mutations present in
ctDNA may lead to non-invasive diagnosis of malignancy, improved detection of tumor recur-
rence, and better monitoring of response to therapy.
A limitation of this study was that very short rat cell-free DNA fragments (<100 bp) were
detected in the GBM41 animal (Fig 1F, red line) and very short human ctDNA fragments
middle and last columns report the digital droplet PCR results for mutant allele frequency (%) in the library
and the gel fraction, respectively. In E, the ratio of the mutant allele frequency in each fraction to the MAF in
the library was plotted for each tumor patient. The dashed gray line represents a ratio of 1 (i.e., no increase or
decrease in MAF). To account for variability during gel fraction excision between samples, the x-axis location
for plotting values associated with each gel fraction was determined via densitometry by subtracting the peak
fragment length for each library from the peak fragment length for each fraction. Negative values correspond
to shorter fragments and positive values correspond to longer fragments. The blue shaded box identifies the
region where increase in the mutant allele frequency was the greatest across all samples.

 (<100 bp) were detected in the Control1 animal (S1D Fig, blue line) that were not present in
the other animals. In the former, these very small fragments created a unique bimodal distribu-
tion of normal rat cell-free DNA. In the latter, these fragments were associated with an
increased proportion of human ctDNA compared to other control animals (Fig 1C). As such, it
was unclear if low levels (<0.01%) of ctDNA in tumor-bearing animals were a true signal or
noise. Earlier use of a xenograft model for detection of ctDNA via PCR found a very high spe-
cies sensitivity and specificity [24]. Although the very short fragments identified in our study
were most likely secondary to contamination or sample handling, future xenograft-based stud-
ies utilizing species specific genomes obtained from massively parallel sequencing to separate
ctDNA from cell-free DNA would benefit from determination of sensitivity and specificity. A
second limitation is the accuracy of densitometry measurements (S14 Fig). Although densi-
tometry tended to preserve relative differences between samples, we found that estimation of
true fragment length was often over-estimated. As such, sequencing results may provide a
more accurate measure of fragment length assuming sufficient reads of different sized inserts
are available to reduce size profile noise.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
All human subject research was approved by the University of Utah Institutional Review Board
prior to study initiation. Written informed consent was obtained for samples from melanoma
patients and healthy controls according to IRB approved studies 10924 and 7740. Informed
consent was not obtained for the lung cancer samples as specimens were obtained from
residual clinical samples scheduled for disposal and after de-identification according to IRB
approved study 7275. Adult male RNU rats were used in this study. All procedures were
approved by the University of Washington Internal Animal Care and Use Committee prior to
study initiation. For surgery, rats were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine administered
IP. For imaging, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane mixed with oxygen. Rats were eutha-
nized with Beuthanasia-D administered IP.
Cell Culture
Established human GBM stem-like cell lines (GBM4, GBM8) [18, 19] were maintained in
serum-free Neurobasal medium (ThermoFisher Scientific) with 2 mM glutamine, 5 μg/mL
heparin, 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin, N2 at 0.5X, B27 supplement minus vitamin A at
0.5X, and bi-weekly pulsing of FGF and EGF (20 ng/mL each). Human hepatocellular carci-
noma cells (Hep G2; ATCC) were maintained in Williams’ medium E with glutamine and
10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C in 5%
CO2.
For implantation, single cell suspensions of GBM4 and GBM8 were achieved using heparin-
EDTA and trituration followed by spin and wash ×2 with Neurobasal medium, then spin and
resuspend in Neurobasal medium with DNase (4k U/ml), trituration, and incubation ×5 min-
utes at room temperature. Cells were then washed ×2 with Neurobasal medium to remove
DNase and resuspended in Neurobasal medium for cell counting. Cells were counted with a
hemacytometer after suspension in Trypan blue. For implantation, 1×106 cells were resus-
pended in 10 μL of Neurobasal medium. Hep G2 cells were harvested by heparin-EDTA,
counted using a hemocytometer after suspension in Trypan blue. For implantation, 5×106 cells
were resuspended in 100 μL of Williams’ medium E.

 Animal Procedures
Adult male RNU rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were used in this study.
All procedures were approved by the University of Washington Internal Animal Care and Use
Committee prior to study initiation.
Rats were anesthetized with 60 mg/kg ketamine and 5 mg/kg xylazine administered IP. For
intracranial inoculation (GBM4 and GBM8), the head was immobilized in a stereotactic head
set with ear bars and a teeth bar. The skull was exposed by a 2 cm midline incision, and a burr
hole was created on the right side 1 mm anterior and 2 mm lateral to the bregma. A microsyr-
inge (Hamilton, Reno, NV) was used to inject the 10 μL aliquot of 106 cells into the frontal lobe
at a depth of 5 mm from the skull surface over a period of 5 minutes. The needle was kept in
place 2 minutes after injection to prevent backflow prior to removal. The burr hole was filled
with bone wax (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ). The skin was closed with surgical staples that were
removed prior to MR imaging. For flank injections (Hep G2), a 22-gauge needle attached to a
TB syringe was used to inject the cells subcutaneously into the right flank.
After the final imaging time point, the rats were anesthetized with Beuthanasia-D (2 mL/
kg). A midline abdominal incision followed by thoracotomy was made to access the left ventri-
cle of the heart. A 22-gauge needle attached to a syringe containing heparin was used to remove
as much blood as possible (6–10 mL). Subsequently, 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) was injected
into the left ventricle (total volume 150 mL) as the right atrium was opened. Brains were subse-
quently removed intact, held in 4% PFA×24 hours under gentle agitation, and then maintained
in PBS.
Histology
After fixation, brains were sectioned to correspond with the anatomic coronal plane. Brains
were subsequently embedded in paraffin and sections (5 μm thick) were stained with hematox-
ylin-eosin. Stained slides were scanned using an Olympus VS110 virtual microscopy system
(Olympus, Center Valley, PA) for display on NDP.view (v2.3.1).
Animal Imaging
Rats were imaged on a 3.0 T Philips Achieva whole-body MRI scanner (Philips Medical Sys-
tems, Best, Netherlands) using a dual coil approach. A quadrature transmit/receive head coil
(Philips Medical Systems) was utilized for RF transmission, and an in-house-built combined
solenoid-surface coil [30] dedicated to high spatial resolution whole-brain rat imaging was
used for RF reception. After induction in an anesthesia chamber with 5% isoflurane mixed
with oxygen, the rats were positioned within the dual coils and maintained on 2% isoflurane
mixed with oxygen via nose cone inhalation. Total scan time for all images was < 1 hour.
Bound-Pool Fraction Map Acquisition
Images necessary for construction of bound-pool fraction maps in the rat brain were acquired
as previously described [20]. Briefly, Z-spectra data points were acquired for each rat using a
3D MT-prepared spoiled gradient echo (GRE) sequence with TR/TE = 42/4.6 ms, excitation
flip angle α = 10°, NEX = 1, and three offset frequencies (Δ = 4, 8, and 96 kHz) of the off-reso-
nance saturation pulse (effective flip angle = 950°). Complementary R1 maps necessary for
parameter fitting were obtained using the variable flip angle method [21] with a 3D spoiled
GRE sequence (TR/TE = 20/2.3 ms, α = 4 (NEX = 3), 10 (NEX = 1), 20 (NEX = 2), and 30°
(NEX = 3)). All Z-spectral and VFA images were acquired with a FOV = 29×29×19.8 mm3,
matrix = 97×97×66, acquisition resolution = 0.3×0.3×0.3 mm3 (zero-interpolated to

 0.15×0.15×0.15 mm3), and full-Fourier acquisition. Whole-brain 3D B0 and B1 maps were
acquired to correct for field heterogeneities. For B0 mapping, the GRE-based dual-TE phase-
difference method [31] was used with TR/TE1/TE2 = 20/4.7/5.7 ms and α = 10°. B1 maps were
obtained using the actual flip angle imaging method [32] and the following sequence parame-
ters: TR1/TR2/TE = 25/125/6.6 ms and α = 60°. 3D B0 and B1 maps were acquired with a
FOV = 29×29×19.8, matrix = 64×64×33, acquisition resolution = 0.45×0.45×0.6 mm3 (zero-
interpolated to 0.15×0.15×0.15 mm3), and NEX = 1. All images were acquired in the coronal
plane.
Contrast-Enhanced MRI
For administration of gadolinium (gadopentetate dimeglumine, Bayer HealthCare; 0.5 M/L) a
22 Gauge angiocatheter (Becton-Dickinson, Sandy, Utah) was inserted into the rat tail vein.
The catheter was attached to a small bore bifurcated extension (Smiths Medical, Dublin, OH)
containing a dilution of gadolinium in one arm and a normal saline flush in the other. The
catheter setup was maintained with a saline lock until immediately prior to imaging. At time of
injection, 0.2 mmol/kg (0.167 M/L) of gadolinium was manually injected at 50 μL/s followed
by a 250 μL flush of normal saline at 50 μL/s. Complementary pre-contrast R1 maps necessary
for parameter fitting and post-contrast R1 maps obtained 5 minutes after contrast injection
were acquired using the variable flip angle method [21] with a 3D SPGR sequence (TR/
TE = 4.6/20 ms, α = 4 (NEX = 3), 10 (NEX = 1), 20 (NEX = 2), and 30° (NEX = 3)) and
FOV = 24×24×8.25 mm3, matrix = 64×64×5.5 for an acquisition resolution of 0.38×0.38×1.5
mm3 (zero-interpolated to 0.19×0.19×0.75 mm3). Pre-contrast B1 maps using the actual flip
angle imaging method [32] were acquired with the following parameters: TR1/TR2/TE = 25/
125/6.7 ms and α = 60°. 3D B1 maps were acquired with a NEX = 1 and an identical resolution
as the variable flip angle data points. All images were acquired in the axial plane.
Image Processing
Fast bound-pool fraction parametric maps (f maps) were constructed consistent with a previ-
ously described methodology [20] for single parameter determination of f. Briefly, R1 maps
were used to define R1
F and reconstructed from VFA data using a linear fit to the signal intensi-
ties (S) transformed into the coordinates [S(α) / sin α, S(α) / tan α][21] after voxel-based B1
corrections were applied to α. In the MT data, the Δ = 96 kHz Z-spectra images were used to
normalize the Δ = 4 and 8 kHz data points and voxel-based B0 and B1 corrections were applied
to Δ and α, respectively, during voxel-based fitting for f. The parameters k, T2
FR1
F, and T2
B
were constrained to 29 x f/(1-f) s-1, 0.030, 10.7 μs, respectively, as previously determined [20].
R1
B, the longitudinal relaxation of the bound-pool, was set to a fixed value of 1 s-1 by conven-
tion [33–35].
Pre- and post-contrast R1 maps were similarly constructed from the respective VFA data
that was acquired in the axial plane. Corresponding pre-contrast B1 maps were similarly
applied for correction of α during fitting of both pre- and post-contrast R1 maps. Image pro-
cessing dedicated to whole-brain voxel-based determination of f maps and R1 maps was per-
formed using in-house written Matlab (The Mathworks, Natick, MA) and C/C++ language
software.
Rat Samples: Plasma Collection, Storage, and Cell-Free DNA Isolation
Whole blood acquired from each animal was centrifuged at 1,600 g ×10 minutes at 4°C. The
plasma layer was removed and centrifuged at 16,000 g ×10 minutes at 4°C. The buffy coat was
then collected and stored at -80°C. After centrifugation, plasma was removed excepting a

 residual amount near the bottom that may have been in contact with any debris and stored at
-80°C. Both plasma samples and the buffy coat were stored at -80°C <1 hour from time of col-
lection from the animal.
DNA was isolated from buffy coat cell pellets using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue
kit. Shotgun sequencing libraries were constructed with 50 nanograms of gDNA from each ani-
mal using the Nextera DNA library prep kit (Illumina). Following the manufacturer’s direction,
sample index sequences were added during the PCR step to allow libraries to be pooled for
multiplexed sequencing on a single lane.
Cell-free DNA was extracted from rat plasma using the QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid
kit. DNA yield was measured with a Qubit dsDNA HS assay (Invitrogen) and 1–10 ng of cell-
free DNA was used as input for library construction with the Thruplex-LC kit (Rubicon Geno-
mics). For samples with low input concentration (<100 pg/ul), cell-free DNA was first concen-
trated across Zymo Clean-Concentrate-5 column (Zymo Research).
Rat Samples: NGS Library Preparation, Sequencing, and Bioinformatics
During library construction, enrichment PCR was performed using a BioRad MiniOpticon
real-time thermocycler, with SYBR Green I dye (Invitrogen) added to each reaction at a final
concentration of 0.25X. Reactions were individually removed upon entering log-phase amplifi-
cation as indicated by SYBR signal (7–17 cycles).
Libraries were normalized to 2 nM each and pooled for paired-end 101-bp sequencing
across four lanes on an Illumina Hiseq 2000 instrument. A 9-bp index read was also collected
and used to demultiplex reads according to input sample, requiring fewer than 2 mismatches
to the known indices.
For each buffy coat and cell-free DNA library, adapter sequences were trimmed and paired
end reads were mapped to human and rat reference assemblies (hg19 and rn5, respectively)
using bwa [36]. For each read pair, the species origin (rat or human) was then determined
using the mapping status against both references. Only reads that could be unambiguously
mapped to one or the other species were included: reads with low mapping quality score (<30)
in both species’ references were discarded, as were reads of comparable mapping quality to
both references (absolute difference in map quality scores <20). Tumor DNA abundance in
each cell-free DNA and buffy coat fraction was then computed as (# human read pairs) / (#
human read pairs + #rat read pairs). Fragment length were then takes as the absolute distances
between the outermost bases of each pair of forward and reverse ends.
As a quality control check, an aliquot of each xenografted cell line at the time of implanta-
tion was genotyped across a panel of 96 human polymorphisms using a custom BeadArray
assay performed by the Northwest Genomics Center. Cell lines with identical genotype calls
in � 95 of 96 markers were considered to be identical in origin, whereas all other pairs of cell
lines shared genotypes at many fewer markers (34–45; S15 Fig).
Human Samples: Plasma Collection, Storage, and Cell-Free DNA
Isolation
All procedures were approved by the University of Utah Internal Review Board prior to study
initiation. Blood samples were collected in Streck BCT tubes, stored at 4°C, and processed
within 24 hours of collection. Plasma was separated by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 1900g
and aspiration to a new tube. Plasma was further centrifuged for 16,000g x 10 minutes to
remove any cellular debris, and resulting supernatant was stored at –20°C until cell-free DNA
isolation. Custom kits that combined Qiagen lysis and binding buffer with Zymo silica-based
columns were assembled to reduce expense during isolation of cell-free DNA. Cell-free DNA

 was prepared from 8 mL of plasma by adding 800 μL of Proteinase K (20 mg/mL) and 6.4 mL
Buffer ACL (Qiagen) followed by incubation at 60°C x 30 minutes. Next, 14.4 mL of buffer
ACB (Qiagen) was added to the lysate and incubated on ice for 5 minutes. DNA was isolated
from the lysate with Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator 100 kit according to the manufactur-
er’s instructions and eluted in 150 μL. A final purification step was performed using two vol-
umes of Ampure XP magnetic beads followed by elution in 25–30 μL 10mM Tris (pH 8.0).
Human Samples: NGS Library Preparation, Sequencing, and
Bioinformatics
Melanoma Samples.
Libraries for Illumina high throughput sequencing were prepared
using the KAPA biosystems Hyper Prep Kit with either 40 ng (pooled normal) or 100 ng (mela-
noma) of input cell-free DNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell-free DNA
libraries were enriched for regions of interest using a custom designed IDT Xgen capture probe
set containing full exonic coverage of the following genes: AKT1, ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2,
ESR1, KIT, KRAS, MAP2K1, MET, MTOR, NRAS, PDGFRA, PIK3CA, PTCH1, PTEN, SMO,
and TP53. Paired-end sequencing of libraries was performed on an Illumina MiSeq. FASTQ
files were aligned to the HG19 assembly of the human genome using bwa mem (v. 0.7.9a-r786)
and insert size metrics for each sample were assessed using Picard tools (v. 1.107). Tumor frac-
tion as a function of insert size was analyzed using the Pysam samtools API.
Lung Cancer Samples.
Libraries for Illumina high throughput sequencing were prepared
using the KAPA biosystems Hyper Prep Kit with 10 ng input cell-free DNA according to the
manufacturer’s instructions using truncated duplex molecular barcode adapters [37]. A 100 ng
aliquot of the library was further amplified using the Kapa HiFi 2x master mix with the full
length adapter primer containing the sample specific index. Cell-free DNA libraries were
enriched for regions of interest using a custom designed IDT Xgen capture probe set contain-
ing full exonic or hotspot coverage of the following genes: AKT1, ALK, BRAF, CTNNB, DDR2,
EGFR, ERBB2, KIT, KRAS, MAP2K1, MET, MTOR, NRAS, PIK3CA, PTEN, and TP53. Paired-
end sequencing of libraries was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500. Reads in FASTQ files
were collapsed into unique observations based on molecular barcodes and alignment informa-
tion. Reads were aligned to the GRCh37 reference genome using bwa mem (v. 0.7.12a-r1044).
Fragment length was derived from paired-end alignment information according to SAM for-
mat [38]. Overlapping read pairs were treated as single observations, and barcodes observed
only once were omitted from analysis due to their relatively higher error rates. Copy number
alterations were identified with the mean read depth of unique observations for each gene.
Human Samples: Fragment Selection and Digital Droplet PCR
Polyacrylamide Gel Excision and Extraction.
Selected libraries made with the truncated
barcoded adapters described above were loaded (1 μg) on an 8% native polyacrylamide gel. A
custom-made ladder of double-stranded DNA fragment was loaded into the wells adjacent to
the sample. The ladder was constructed from lambda phage using Hot Start Taq DNA poly-
merase (Roche) and the following primer pairs:
262 bp: 5’–CATCTGCTTCTGCTTTCGCC–3’ and 3’–CTGGGTATTTCCCGGCCTTT–5’
240 bp: 5’–GGAACCCACCGAGTGAAAGT–3’ and 3’–ACTCTTTCCATGCCGCTTCA–5’
229 bp: 5’–GATGGCTCGCCAGTTCCATA–3’ and 3’–ACCAATATCCAGCACCGCAT–5’
Ladder lengths were selected to generally reflect the size of normal and tumor-derived cell-
free DNA fragments observed by sequencing after the addition of the truncated adapters (~99
bp). The ladder contained 75 ng of each of the three fragment lengths. Six consecutive frag-
ments were selected from the gel for DNA extraction after the gel was incubated in TBE with

 SYBER safe (Thermofisher) per the manufacturer’s instructions at RT x 30 minutes on a gentle
shaker. Individual gel pieces were disrupted with Gel Breaker Tubes (IST Engineering Inc., Mil-
pitas, CA), suspended in diffusion buffer (0.5 M ammonium acetate; 10 mM magnesium ace-
tate; 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0; 0.1% SDS), placed in a heating block at 50°C for 1 hour and then
placed on a shaker at room temperature overnight. Gel pieces were removed by passing the
sample through a 5 μM filter tube (IST Engineering Inc.). Three volumes of QG buffer (Qia-
gen) were then added to the sample which was subsequently applied to a QIAquick Spin Col-
umn (Qiagen). DNA was extracted from the column following the manufacturer’s protocol for
the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and eluted in 30 μL. A 5–10 ng aliquot of each
fraction and 10 ng of the original library was then amplified using the Kapa HiFi 2x master mix
with the full length adapter primer containing a sample specific index. Samples were purified
using a matched volume (1x) of Ampure XP magnetic beads followed by elution in 25 μL ATE.
A TapeStation 2200 (Agilent Technologies) was used to evaluate fragment distribution.
Digital Droplet PCR.
EGFR T790M mutant allele frequencies were determined by picoli-
ter digital droplet PCR (RainDance Technologies) using a droplet size of 5 pL. PCR primers,
hydrolysis probes, and amplification conditions were implemented exactly as described in the
study by Milbury et al. [39]. Total PCR reaction volume prepared was 25 μL and contained
~100 ng of cell-free DNA. All primers and probes were synthesized by Integrated DNA Tech-
nologies. Droplet counts were determined using the RainDrop Analyst software. For each sam-
ple, the amplified library prior to size selection was used to define gates of EGFR wildtype and
T790M droplet populations.
Statistical Analysis
For continuous variables, the means and standard deviations (SDs) were calculated for each
group. The student’s independent t-test assuming equal or unequal variance based on Levene’s
test was used to compare mean values between tumor patients and healthy controls. Pearson’s
r was used to identify correlations between continuous variables. Statistical analyses were per-
formed with SPSS for Windows (Version 12.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL). Statistical significance was
defined as P < 0.05.

mals implanted with Hep G2 cells, and animals corresponding to coronal bound-pool fraction
maps (f maps, colored arrows in A identify results that correspond to images in B) and pre-
and post-contrast R1 maps (B) with matched histology (C). GBM45 was a well circumscribed
tumor that seemed to be dural-based as there was no evidence of intra-parenchymal tumor
growth on histology (C; asterisk corresponds to 2x magnification of tissue that was loosely

 attached at location of asterisk). Despite strong contrast-enhancement and reasonable tumor
size (B), detection of ctDNA was low (A, red arrow). GBM85 was a relatively large tumor with
modest contrast enhancement (B). However, detection of human ctDNA was only modestly
elevated and the fragment length distribution was irregular with only very mild evidence of an
increased fragment distribution in the 134 to 144 bp range (D). In D, fragment distribution for
human ctDNA was largely erratic due to few observations.

S3 Fig. In lung cancer patients, a correlation between fragment length size and concentra-
tion of cell-free DNA in plasma was not present. In A, plasma concentration of cell-free
DNA from lung cancer patients was significantly higher compared to healthy controls,
although substantial overlap between groups was present. In B, boxplots of the peak fragment
length by densitometry for lung cancer patients and healthy controls found variability in both
cohorts; however, the fragment length of tumor patients was significantly shorter compared to
controls (p = 0.002). In C, peak fragment length and overall cell-free DNA concentration were
not significantly associated in either the lung cancer patients (Pearson’s r = –0.20, p = 0.47) or
the healthy controls (Pearson’s r = 0.19, p = 0.63; Fig 4C).

S4 Fig. Limitations of analyzing fragment size distribution with densitometry using origi-
nal cell-free DNA samples. Results from TapeStation analysis are shown for four control cell-
free DNA samples (A-D) using the original cell-free DNA as input (left column) and the cor-
responding truncated adapter library as input (right column). In A, there is good identifica-
tion of the upper and lower markers and a distinct peak for the cell-free DNA when using the
original sample (left column). In B and C, the location of the upper marker (left column, red
arrows) was ambiguous. Incorrect identification of the upper marker will substantially alter
the fragment length of the peak associated with cell-free DNA. In D, the frequently low con-
centration of cell-free DNA in plasma from healthy controls led to a peak doublet (left col-
umn, red arrow) causing ambiguous determination of the actual peak fragment length.
Utilizing the truncated adapter library enabled clear identification of the upper and lower
marker and loading of an identical amount (2 ng/μL) of cell-free DNA for each sample (A-D,
right column).

gels. The ladder was constructed from phage lambda double-stranded DNA consisting of three
lengths: 229 bp (red), 240 bp (blue), and 262 bp (magenta). An image of the gel is shown in A.
In B, peak fragment length as measured by densitometry is identified for each element of the
ladder above the corresponding peak. Estimation of fragment length by densitometry was sus-
ceptible to an overestimation up to ~10 bp. Relative differences in the ladder were better pre-
served during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (S8 Fig).
