Summary
a patient with severe postural orthostatic tachycardia 
syndrome (pots) and mast cell activation syndrome 
(MCas) received immunotherapy with low-dose 
naltrexone (LDN) and intravenous immunoglobulin 
(IVIg) and antibiotic therapy for small intestinal bacterial 
overgrowth (sIBo). a dramatic and sustained response 
was documented. the utility of IVIg in autoimmune 
neuromuscular diseases has been published, but clinical 
experience with pots is relatively unknown and has not 
been reported in MCas. as a short-acting mu-opioid 
antagonist, LDN paradoxically increases endorphins 
which then bind to regulatory t cells which regulate 
t-lymphocyte and B-lymphocyte production and this 
reduces cytokine and antibody production. IVIg is 
emerging as a promising therapy for pots. Diagnosis and 
treatment of sIBo in pots is a new concept and appears 
to play an important role.
BaCkground
These syndromes are generally regarded as rare or 
are never diagnosed owing to lack of awareness 
by physicians. The prevalence of postural ortho-
static tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is at least 
170/100 000, and the prevalence of mast cell acti-
vation syndrome (MCAS) is estimated between 1% 
and 17%.1 2 The confusing magnitude of symp-
toms led to delay in diagnosis and disability in our 
patient as is the case for the majority of patients 
with these syndromes.1–4 Fatigue, muscle pain, 
presyncope/syncope, headache, itching, urticaria, 
paraesthesia, nausea, chills, oedema, eye irritation, 
dyspnoea and heartburn are experienced by ≥50% 
of patients with MCAS.2 Postural lightheadedness 
especially in the morning, palpitations, presyncope, 
headache, blurry vision, memory problems are 
experienced by ≥50% of patients with POTS.4 To 
further complicate matters, 17 of 48 MCAS symp-
toms overlap with 33 POTS symptoms which is 
explained by comorbidity of the syndromes, where 
30% of patients with POTS also have MCAS.5 
Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common in 
both syndromes.1–4 6 GI symptoms in MCAS can 
be explained by inappropriate release of mediators 
from mast cells (MCs) with KIT mutations whereas 
GI motility disorders in POTS may be due to active 
autoimmune muscarinic antibodies causing auto-
nomic imbalance in some patients (S Vernino, 
personal communication, 2017).2 Physicians may 
erroneously attribute these frequent GI symptoms 
in undiagnosed MCAS and POTS patients to irri-
table bowel syndrome (IBS) and psychological 
disturbances as was the case in our patient.
POTS is generally divided into two categories: 
neuropathic and hyperadrenergic; the latter is diffi-
cult to treat and is thought in part to be associated 
with MC as a driving force in some patients.5 7 POTS 
therapy has historically focused on treating ortho-
static intolerance which does not address other 
systems (eg, GI tract, urinary bladder sphincter, 
ocular and central nervous system). MCAS therapy 
is directed at MC stabilisation, which is complicated 
by the fact that MC can release 200 mediators many 
of which have a wide array of triggers.2 Small intes-
tinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) causes abdominal 
pain, bloating and abnormal bowel function—
these symptoms are prevalent in both syndromes 
yet a specific investigation has not been reported. 
The dramatic response to therapy in this patient is 
remarkable and could help others who suffer from 
POTS and MCAS.
CaSe preSenTaTion
Case
A 43-year-old Caucasian femaleF experienced 
MCAS symptoms at age 18: specific foods and 
odours caused flushing, rashes, itching, wheezing, 
dizziness and nausea. At age 20, she noted prob-
lems with postprandial bloating/pain, constipation, 
evacuating stool and flatus with rotten egg odour. 
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) gradually developed. 
At age 23, she developed orthostatic lightheaded-
ness and tachycardia, body pain, generalised weak-
ness and painful dependent leg oedema. Ultimately, 
she suffered from 45 individual clinically significant 
symptoms (table 1). For 6 years, she became disabled 
owing to orthostatic symptoms, fatigue and body 
pain. Faecal evacuation resulted in syncope with 
efforts >3 
min. Early satiety led to a liquid diet. 
Pressure-induced hives and angioedema, paraes-
thesia and nocturnal urination (seven times nightly) 
interfered with sleep. Over 16 years, 19 physicians 
failed to diagnose POTS and MCAS which were 
established at a second location of the Mayo Clinic. 
Supine pulse of 80 beats/min increased to 160 after 
standing 10 
min. Facial rash and oedema, cold, blue 
hands, Terry’s fingernails and dermatographism 
were present (figure 1).

novel treatment (new drug/intervention; established drug/procedure in new situation)
The patient is a biostatistician who did not smoke or drink. 
The family history was unremarkable.
inveSTigaTionS
The tilt table test demonstrated the presence of hyperadrenergic 
POTS (increase in heart rate >30 
beats/min, rise in systolic blood 
pressure ≥10 mm 
Hg and serum norepinephrine level ≥600 
pg/
mL). The standing serum norepinephrine was 754 
pg/mL 
(normal 119–451 pg/mL). Sudomotor testing revealed dimin-
ished postganglionic sympathetic function in feet. Abnormal 
tests included leukocytes 3.1 10^9/L (normal 3.4–10.6/10^9/
L), platelets 113 10^9/L (normal 149–375/10^9/L), low T4 
and T3, and elevated 24-hour urine leukotriene E4 523 
pg/mg 
creatinine (normal <104 pg/mg) and 11β-prostaglandin-F2α 
1796 ng/mmol creatinine (normal <1000 ng/mmol creatinine). 
Normal tests included chemistry panels, lactate, cold agglutinins, 
tryptase, ferritin and 24-hour urine levels of metanephrine, 
N-methylhistamine and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). 
The antithyroid peroxidase antibody was the only positive auto-
antibody. Nineteen other commercially available autoantibodies 
(including Sjogren’s, lupus and coeliac antibodies) that can be 
linked to, but not mechanistically active in POTS were absent.
The diagnosis of MCAS was established by: (1) presence of the 
major MCAS criterion: presence of a constellation of complaints 
attributable to pathologically increased MC activity in ≥2 
organ 
systems and (2) presence of ≥1 of 4 minor criteria.2 The patient 
had 47 of the 48 known MCAS symptoms with dysfunction of 
the cardiovascular, respiratory and GI systems as well as symp-
tomatic involvement of the skin, eyes and nose (table 1). The 
patient had biochemical evidence for MC activity (two urine 
assays) and she ultimately had response to medical therapy 
directed against MC.
differenTial diagnoSiS
Differential diagnosis in POTS includes: cardiac arrhythmia, 
venous insufficiency, chronic fatigue syndrome, anxiety and 
various GI disorders including acid reflux disease, gastric 
emptying disorders, pelvic floor dysfunction, IBS, carcinoid 
syndrome and pheochromocytoma. For this patient, all specific 
diseases and triggers known to cause POTS were excluded.1 
Specifically, there was no history, physical findings, radiographic

injury, Lyme’s disease, human papillomavirus vaccination, preg-
nancy, median arcuate ligament syndrome, hypermobile Ehlers-
Danlos syndrome (EDS) (present in 30% of POTS), coeliac 
disease, Sjogren’s syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome, rheu-
matoid arthritis, lupus and common variable immunodeficiency. 
The norepinephrine was elevated but not to the level seen in 
pheochromocytoma. Differential diagnosis of MCAS includes: 
chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, generalised allergies, 
asthma, sinusitis, rosacea, anxiety, IBS, interstitial cystitis, 
carcinoid syndrome and pheochromocytoma. The duration of 
the illness and the 5-HIAA measurement excludes carcinoid 
syndrome.
TreaTmenT
Thyroid replacement led to resolution of RLS. Hypothyroidism 
is a known cause for this syndrome. POTS vasoactive medica-
tions (midodrine, amphetamine and droxidopa), MCAS medica-
tions including cromolyn sodium, monteleukast, antihistamines 
(hydroxyzine and all over-the-counter H1 and H2 blockers) and 
acetylsalicylic acid, support stockings, high salt diet and thyroid 
supplementation failed to give the patient any relief.
The patient studied low-dose naltrexone (LDN) and intra-
venous immunoglobulin (IVIg) on the Internet as alternative 
therapy for pain and POTS. As a scientist, the patient tracked 
symptoms which were later divided into three syndromes 
(table 1). In the absence of validated scoring systems for MCAS 
and POTS, the severity and frequency scores for symptoms 
were established by the authors as 10-point Likert scales: (A) 
Frequency: 0=never, 1=once 
a month or less, 2=1–3 times a 
month, 3=once 
a week, 4=a 
few times a week, 5=most days, 
6=once 
a day, 7=a 
few times per day, 8=most of the time, 
9=nearly 
constantly, 10=constantly, without exception and (B) 
Severity: 0=non 
existent, 1=very 
mild, 2=rather 
mild, 3=mild, 
4=low 
moderate, 5=moderate, 6=high 
moderate, 7=starting 
to 
be severe, 8=severe, 9=extremely 
severe, 10=most 
severe 
possible. IBS studies have used Likert scores as well. More 
recently a combined response that includes a decrease in pain of 
30% or more and improvement in stool form over a period of 
time have been used in drug studies; however, this was not felt 
to be as helpful in this single case report.
Her internist prescribed ultra-low-dose naltrexone (1 
mg 
every night as opposed to dose escalation to ideal dose of 4.5 
mg) 
while waiting for insurance approval for IVIg to be used for the 
Food and Drug Administration-approved indication of pres-
sure-induced urticaria. Ultra-low-dose naltrexone for 6 weeks 
improved body pain, mood, memory, sleep, flushing, food and 
odour sensitivities and paraesthesia: 7% decrease in POTS and 
17% decrease in MCAS severity scores. Subsequently, IVIg 1.5 
g/
kg (Privigen) and 125 
mg methylprednisolone were adminis-
tered monthly. Naltrexone was continued at 1 
mg every night. 
Six days after the first IVIg infusion, syncope, tinnitus, anal 
outlet disorder and vascular spasm ceased. Capillary refill time 
was >1 
min before IVIg and reduced to <2 
s. The next two infu-
sions further improved body pain, weakness, vertigo, ability to 
eat and facial changes. Subsequent infusions maintained symp-
tomatic improvement but the efficacy did not improve further 
(figure 2). The platelet counts normalised when measured after 
the sixth infusion.
After GI consultation, the naltrexone dose was increased 
and a lactulose breath test (LBT), an indirect test for SIBO, was 
obtained.8 The LBT had a flat-line pattern suggesting excretion 
of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) which was confirmed by a prototype 
H2S breath test machine (Commonwealth Labs, Boston, Massa-
chusetts, USA). Rifaximin 550 
mg tablet per os three times a day 
for 2 
weeks and a low sulfate/sulfide diet eliminated postprandial 
bloating, abdominal pain, constipation and foul gas. Subsequent 
dose escalations of LDN and short-term rifaximin improved 
therapeutic response curves: 24% decrease in POTS and 43% 
decrease in MCAS severity scores (figure 2).
ouTCome and follow-up
After 10 IVIg treatments, a previously scheduled appointment 
at Mayo Clinic Scottsdale included autonomic testing which 
showed resolution of tachycardia with head-up tilt along with 
improvement in sudomotor function. At the time of submis-
sion of this report, the patient has had 20 IVIg treatments with 
a maximum of 5 weeks without one because the effects start 
to wear off. A trial of mycophenolate mofetil led to immune 
suppression. The next plan is to add new mast cell therapies in 
combination with IVIg and LDN.
diSCuSSion
A patient with severe POTS, MCAS and SIBO responded to a 
combination of LDN, IVIg and antibiotic therapy. We theorise 
figure 1 (A) Vasospasm with cyanosis and oedema, Terry’s nails, and facial flushing, rash and oedema; (B) After third intravenous immunoglobulin 
infusion, face returned to normal and hand colour, swelling and temperature improved. The patient gave her permission to use uncensored

novel treatment (new drug/intervention; established drug/procedure in new situation)
that pre-existing MCAS was the driving force for hyperadren-
ergic POTS in this patient. This is the first case to our knowledge 
where immunotherapy with IVIg led to significant and sustained 
improvement in MCAS as has been seen in publications of auto-
immune neuromuscular diseases and a single case of POTS.9 10 
Other patients with MCAS have had response in their MC symp-
toms to IVIg.2 To our knowledge, this is also the first reported 
case of LDN improving symptoms of POTS and MCAS. Anti-
biotic therapy with rifaximin led to cessation of two decades 
of significant GI problems in our patient. Huang et al reported 
that 7/12 patients with POTS had dilated and/or air–fluid levels 
in the small intestine.11 We theorise that sustained sympathetic 
activity suppresses peristalsis, leading to stasis and development 
of SIBO in some patients with POTS. Alternative explanations 
for SIBO in POTS or MCAS who have concomitant EDS include 
presence of droopy small bowel loops or motor dysfunction due 
to protein deposition.12 We also theorise that eliminating SIBO 
can lessen MCAS and subsequent POTS by reducing intestinal 
permeability, thus reducing MC recruitment as well as T-cell 
activity and cytokines which activate MC.
In the present case, severe symptoms of MCAS preceded onset 
of POTS, thus, two driving forces are theorised to be important: 
mast cell activation adjacent to autonomic nerves and/or 
persistent recruitment and/or activation of MC due to bacte-
rial overgrowth.5 7 13 It is less likely that an autoimmune neuro-
pathic process is operative. However, we could not measure 
investigative adrenergic active autoantibodies and muscarinic 
acetylcholinesterase autoantibodies in order to include or 
exclude POTS-specific active autoantibodies (S Vernino, personal 
communication, 2017).14
One of the authors (BG) who reported successful treatment of 
POTS associated with Sjogren’s syndrome in 2017 has success-
fully treated over 50 subsequent patients.10 One of our GI clinic 
patients with POTS and MCAS treated with IVIg had improve-
ment in cardiovascular symptoms and a dramatic cessation of 
the abdominal pain and diarrhoea which had triggered 250 
emergency room visits over the past 15 years. Another GI clinic 
patient with POTS and SIBO but not MCAS was treated with 
IVIg had improvement in cardiovascular symptoms and later in 
GI symptoms after repeating antibiotic therapy. The change in 
this patient suggested that autoantibodies were operative.
One common mechanism for high-dose IVIg to work in 
autoimmune disease is binding the Fc portion of autoanti-
bodies.9 MC are most commonly known to have IgE receptors, 
but they also have IgG receptors.15 When these are activated by 
IgG, histamine is released.15 Theoretically, IVIg could overload 
these receptors and ultimately reduce MC mediator release. IVIg 
could also bind to histamine and block histamine activation of 
MC as seen in rats.16 An additional trigger for MC activation 
includes T-cell activity and release of microparticles and cyto-
kines.17 IVIg increases regulatory T-cells which could reduce 
T-cell activity and thereby reduce MC activity.18 Finally, IgG has 
been found to downregulate IgE bound to MC and thus binding 
IgG by IVIg could play an additional role.19

novel treatment (new drug/intervention; established drug/procedure in new situation)
Beneficial effects of LDN on MCAS may include regulating 
overall T-lymphocyte production and decreasing cytokine medi-
ators from T cells which directly cause MC activation, blocking 
Toll receptors which stimulate MC activity and reducing 
neuroinflammatory pain via microglia.12 20–22 Endorphins 
produced by LDN may improve intestinal dysmotility in POTS 
by directly increasing the migrating motor complex which 
prevents small intestinal stasis and subsequent bacterial over-
growth.23 We theorise that neuropathic POTS with an immune 
mechanism may also be improved by LDN via reduction of auto-
immune antibody production by B-lymphocyte regulation.20
In a chart review of 33 additional patients with POTS in our 
GI clinic, 27 had lactulose breath testing (26 women, 1 men, 
mean age 35 years). These patients had MCAS in 27% and EDS 
in 42%. GI symptoms were present in all patients: mid/lower 
abdominal pain (96%), bloating (92%), nausea (85%), consti-
pation (73%), diarrhoea (58%) and heartburn (58%). LBT was 
abnormal in 69% versus abnormal testing in 10% of volunteers 
in a prior control study.24 EDS did not increase the risk of having 
a positive breath test in our clinic patients. When methane was 
present, neomycin was added to rifaximin for 2 
weeks since 
methane producing-bacteria respond best to dual antibiotics.25 
Naltrexone was used by 11 patients and 7 had improvement in 
GI symptoms. Five had improvement in the other syndromes: 
two MCAS, one POTS and two with both. Antibiotics were 
administered to 15 patients: 10 had improvement in GI symp-
toms and 4 had improvement in POTS symptoms. One of these 
patients with POTS and MCAS improved dramatically to LDN 
and antibiotics, but after several months decided to stop LDN. 
Orthostatic symptoms, body pain, pruritus, alopecia, GI symp-
toms and fatigue returned and then later improved on resump-
tion of LDN.
IVIg appeared to be effective for multiple manifestations of 
POTS but this treatment is expensive and has potential signif-
icant side effects. In contrast, LDN is inexpensive, safe and 
appeared to provide effective, adjunctive therapy in both MCAS 
and POTS. Recognition that small bowel dysfunction in POTS 
can lead to SIBO is important since antibiotic treatment can lead 
to significant GI relief.

patient’s perspective
After decades of declining health, despite trying every 
conventional treatment with 100% compliance, I was pretty 
discouraged. I used to be such a high achiever and now I 
couldn’t even stand or sit up. I’d seen numerous top specialists 
and tried everything they recommended. I started seeing doctors 
for these complaints in 1997, and first received diagnoses of 
rosacea and restless leg syndrome. Rosacea was treated with 
antibiotics and numerous laser treatments. RLS was treated 
unsuccessfully with iron supplements and trials of various drugs 
(like ropinerole, which made me pass out). My face flushes 
got better, but other POTS/MCAD/RLS symptoms continued to 
get worse. Cardiologists didn’t find anything, but referred me 
to a neurologist for dizziness and presyncope. The neurologist 
thought I had Lambert Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome, and 
referred me to the Mayo Clinic in 2006. They determined I did 
not have LEMS, but did have ‘excessive venous compliance’, 
and prescribed compression stockings. After that, the original 
neurologist was out of ideas and suggested I get a psych 
evaluation, which I declined. Still getting worse, I got diagnoses 
of Hashimoto's thyroid in 2007 (treated with synthroid) and 
‘severe’ chronic venous insufficiency of the deep venous system 
in 2010 (measured three different times by Doppler ultrasound 
and treated with tighter compression stockings, elevating legs 
and more activity). That was a bit mysterious at the time because 
my valves were intact, so they didn’t know why my blood was 
flowing backwards (later they measured some of my veins at 
much wider diameters than expected, so that probably explains 
it). I saw a gastroenterologist for my ‘potty issues’ in 2012, 
but she didn’t seem to think they were a big deal. In 2013, I 
realised Claritin helped, and that led me to figure out I may have 
POTS and MCAD. I referred myself to Mayo AZ, who confirmed 
it, and they started treatment with all the many drugs listed 
above. I was also diagnosed with ‘delayed pressure urticaria /
angioedema’, DPU which is a mast cell problem where physical 
pressure leads to localised pain and swelling for days after. It’s 
a comically cruel problem to have along with POTS because one 
keeps you from being upright while the other keeps you from 
being able to lie down comfortably more than a few minutes … 
so you writhe on the ground mostly. But I’m grateful I have it 
because it’s the diagnosis that allowed me to receive IVIg!
I feel like I won the lottery last year by discovering LDN, IVIg 
and SIBO treatment. LDN made me feel noticeably happier, 
more energetic, in less pain and with better digestion (and 
these things got better with each dose increase). IVIg was an 
absolute miracle and within a week gave me a life back, with 
a huge improvement of numerous symptoms, most importantly 
fainting, nerve pain and delayed pressure angioedema. But I still 
had daily crippling stomach aches and more gas than a field of 
Holsteins until I took the rifaximin. I can’t believe I went decades 
feeling so bad when I only needed 2 weeks of antibiotics and 
a low-sulfur diet! Now I’m back to standing, eating, sleeping, 
working, living and feeling exceptionally lucky. I give permission 
to Leonard Weinstock, his associates, and any medical journals 
to use my uncensored photographs in medical presentations or

learning points
 
► Patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome 
(POTS) and mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) have 
a wide array of symptoms and require an open mind to 
entertain the diagnoses.
 
► POTS can imitate severe gastrointestinal motility disorders, 
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or frequent ‘IBS’ or small 
intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) relapses after antibiotic 
therapy.
 
► Treatments for hyperadrenergic POTS have had limited in 
efficacy but treatment directed at MCAS can help.
 
► Combined therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin and 
low-dose naltrexone led to significant improvement in a 
severely affected patient.
 
► Antibiotic therapy for SIBO contributed to clinical 
improvement in the case presentation and others in our 
practice for both GI symptoms and POTS/MCAS symptoms.
