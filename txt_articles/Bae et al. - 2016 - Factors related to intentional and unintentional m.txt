Purpose: We assessed medication nonadherence, categorized as intentional or unintentional, 
and related factors in elderly patients with hypertension, correlating the data with measurement 
of blood pressure as the final target of medication adherence and other possible influencing 
factors, such as lifestyle.
Patients and methods: Subjects were aged $65 years, resided in a rural area, and were taking 
antihypertensive drugs. The survey was conducted in July 2014. Participants were divided into the 
following three groups: “Adherence”, “Unintentional nonadherence”, and “Intentional nonadher-
ence”. Individual cognitive components, such as necessity and concern as well as self-efficacy and 
other related factors, were compared according to adherence groups. The interrelationships between 
those factors and nonadherence were tested using structural equation modeling analysis.
Results: Of the 401 subjects, 182 (45.6%) were in the adherence group, 107 (26.7%) in the unin-
tentional nonadherence group, and 112 (27.9%) in the intentional nonadherence group. Necessity 
and self-efficacy were found to have a significant direct influence on unintentional nonadherence 
behaviors (necessity β=-0.171, P=0.019; self-efficacy β=-0.433, P,0.001); concern was not 
statistically significant (β=-0.009, P=0.909). Necessity was found to have significant direct 
and indirect impact on intentional nonadherence (direct β=-0.275, P=0.002; indirect β=-0.113, 
P=0.036). Self-efficacy had no significant direct effect on intentional nonadherence though it had 
the only significant indirect effect on intentional nonadherence (direct β=-0.055, P=0.515; indirect 
β=-0.286, P,0.001). Concern had no significant influence on intentional or on unintentional 
nonadherence (direct β=0.132 0.132, P=0.151; indirect β=-0.006, P=0.909).
Conclusion: Unintentional nonadherence should be regularly monitored and managed because 
of its potential prognostic significance. Interventions addressing cognitive factors, such as 
beliefs about medicine or self-efficacy, are relatively difficult to implement, but are essential 
to improve medication adherence.
Keywords: medication adherence, hypertension, aged, self-control, self-efficacy
Introduction
Hypertension is one of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular disease and 
stroke. With lifestyle modification, medication is considered essential in the treatment 
of persistent hypertension.1 Meta-analyses have revealed that adherence to prescribed 
medication is related to control of hypertension and a lower death rate.2,3 However, 
in 2013, in Korea, a national health and nutrition survey4 found that only ~60% of 
patients took medication prescribed for hypertension regularly and ~40% of patients 
achieved optimum blood pressure. Since the mid-2000s, the rates of adherence and 
blood pressure control in hypertensive patients have not improved in Korea.

The World Health Organization classified the improvement 
of medication adherence as a key factor for the successful 
management of major chronic diseases.5 Measures to 
improve adherence are widely acknowledged to be a primary 
intervention.6
Medication nonadherence can be often classified as inten-
tional or unintentional according to the patient’s perspective.7–12 
Intentional nonadherence is considered a process in which 
the patient actively decides not to take medication or follow 
treatment recommendations, presumably having weighed the 
costs and benefits of treatment. Unintentional nonadherence 
refers to unplanned behavior; it is passive rather than active 
and is sometimes due to factors beyond the patient’s control. 
This classification has significant implications for health 
professionals in that it offers a framework to understand 
medication-taking behaviors and consequently impacts the 
type of intervention chosen to improve adherence.9
Intentional nonadherence is driven by the patient’s 
knowledge, motivation, or beliefs about illness or treat-
ment. Unintentional nonadherence is reportedly more 
related to demographic factors, particularly age, rather 
than the individual’s knowledge or beliefs.8,13 However, 
recent studies indicate that unintentional nonadherence is 
significantly affected by beliefs about illness and medica-
tion or self-efficacy.8,9 A study in American patients with 
chronic disease revealed that unintentional nonadherence 
was somewhat predictable depending on beliefs and 
concerns about medicines.13 Although some studies have 
shown that there is an overlap between the two types of 
nonadherence behaviors,9,13,14 understanding of the inter-
relationship between intentional and unintentional nonad-
herence is still insufficient.
In the self-regulatory model, adherence to medication 
is considered one of the numerous measures that patients 
can adopt to deal with the threat of their illness. In this 
model, adherence is more likely if it makes sense within the 
individual’s concept of the illness. It is a response to one’s 
cognitive and emotional interpretation of past experiences or 
information.15 Based on self-regulatory model, Horne et al16 
developed the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ), 
expecting that beliefs about medications are more strongly 
associated with treatment adherence than are beliefs about 
the illness itself. BMQ evaluates the individual’s perception 
of the necessity for and beneficial effects of treatment and 
concerns about harmful effects and developing dependence. 
In other words, it addresses the individual’s benefits (neces-
sity) and costs (concern) of treatment. The validity of BMQ 
in assessing medication adherence has been demonstrated in 
various diseases and populations.16,17
Self-efficacy is defined as personal confidence of 
performance ability of proceeding a specific task to achieve the 
desired goal, which is known to influence initiation and per-
sistence of health behavior.18 Self-efficacy directly influences 
medication adherence but also mediates effect of cognitive and 
emotional factors, including depression and social support, 
which in turn influences medication adherence.19,20 We have 
limited understanding of self-efficacy when nonadherence of 
medication is separated into intentional and unintentional.
Patients with high medication adherence show a higher 
quality of other lifestyle, known as the “health adherer 
effect”. Simpson et al2 reported that patients with higher 
medication adherence showed lower mortality rate even in the 
placebo group. The association of intentional or unintentional 
medication adherence to lifestyle is not clear.
In this study, we assessed medication nonadherence, cat-
egorized as intentional or unintentional, and related factors in 
elderly patients with hypertension, correlating the data with 
measurement of blood pressure as the final target of medica-
tion adherence and other possible influencing factors, such as 
lifestyle. We intended to examine the effects of individual cog-
nitive factors, such as beliefs about medicines and self-efficacy 
on medication adherence in control of hypertension.
Patients and methods
study subjects
The study was conducted in a rural community. Subjects were 
eligible for participation if they were aged $65 years, resided 
in the rural area, and were taking antihypertensive drugs. The 
survey was conducted in July 2014. The interviewers were 
students in a medical school who were trained in measuring 
blood pressure and conducting the survey. The institutional 
review board of Gyeongsang national university hospital 
approved the study.
The interviewers visited the area and asked elderly resi-
dents whether or not they were taking blood pressure drugs 
and also measured their blood pressure. If they reported 
taking antihypertensives, the interviewers proceeded with 
the survey, filling a questionnaire in a one-on-one interview. 
All participants provided written informed consent prior 
to starting the survey. Subjects were excluded if they had 
severe chronic disease, such as angina, myocardial infarction, 
stroke, or cancer, that could affect adherence to medication 
or if they could not communicate with the interviewers. Data 
for 401 subjects who finished the survey were analyzed.

Medication adherence in elderly patients with hypertension
nonadherence is an active decision not to take medication; 
hence, it was considered a final step of nonadherence. It 
was hypothesized that unintentional nonadherence affects 
intentional nonadherence. For example, patients with unin-
tentional nonadherence may feel that their condition is not 
worsened when they forget to take the medicine, so they begin 
to doubt that the medication is actually effective.21–23 This 
doubt may then result in intentional nonadherence.
Assuming that individual cognitive components, such 
as necessity and concern as well as self-efficacy, are direct 
subjects of patient education and targets of interventions to 
improve adherence to medication, it was hypothesized that 
those components are the final determinants of medication 
adherence. Other factors known to affect adherence, such 
as sociodemographics, illness-related status, polypharmacy, 
and regimen complexity, are thought to affect the cognitive 
components.
Other factors known to affect adherence, such as 
sociodemographics, illness-related status, polypharmacy, 
and regimen complexity, are thought to affect the cogni-
tive components but it was hypothesized that there is no 
control over these factors. Sociodemographics are deter-
mined genetically or socially and illness-related status and 
polypharmacy/regimen complexity are mostly determined 
by diagnosis and severity of patient condition. And these 
factors influence individual cognitive factors, including 
BMQ or self-efficacy, leading each individual patient to 
determine the medication adherence. Influences of socio-
demographics, illness-related status, and polypharmacy/
regimen complexity to necessity/concern and self-efficacy 
were demonstrated using multiple regression analysis. 
And interrelationship of individual cognitive factors and 
medication nonadherence was only presented in structural 
equation modeling (SEM).
The survey included sociodemographic items, such as 
age, gender, education, monthly household income, and 
living with a spouse. Age was measured on a continuous 
scale, and gender was measured on a binary scale. Education 
was measured as a categorical variable with three categories 
ranging from less than or equal to primary school to more 
than or equal to high school. Monthly household income was 
also measured as a categorical variable with three categories 
ranging from “less than 1,000,000 Korean Won (KRW)” 
to “more than or equal to 2,000,000 KRW”. Living with a 
spouse was measured on a binary scale as “yes” or “no”.
Illness-related status and polypharmacy or regimen 
complexity-related variables were also surveyed, including 
drug count, medication frequency, duration of hyperten-
sion, comorbidity, and self-rated health status. Medication 
frequency was measured on a categorical scale with the fol-
lowing four categories: “once a day in the morning”, “once 
a day at night”, “twice a day in the morning and at night”, 
and “thrice a day after every meal”. Given the number of 
categories, medication frequency was treated in the final 
analysis as a binary variable categorized as “once a day” or 
“twice a day”. The duration of hypertension was measured 
on a continuous scale, and comorbidity was reported as 
“yes” or “no”. Self-rated health status was measured as a 
categorical variable with five categories, ranging from “very 
good” to “very poor”. In the final analysis, these responses 
were combined into the following three categories: “good”, 
“moderate”, and “bad”.
Medication adherence
The author used six “yes” or “no” questions, which were 
used in previous Korean research, to assess medication 
nonadherence.7 The items related to intentional nonadherence 
included “you felt worse when you took it”, “you felt like your 
blood pressure is under control”, and “you felt hassled about 
sticking to your blood pressure treatment plan”. Those related 
to unintentional nonadherence included “you forget to take 
your high blood pressure drugs”, “were there any days when

you do not take your high blood pressure medicine over the 
past 2 weeks”, and “you forget to carry your medications when 
you travel or leave home”. These six items were examined 
for content validity by a professor of internal medicine and a 
professor of preventive medicine. Two factors were extracted 
in factor analysis, accounting for 67.3% of the variance. The 
factor loading of each item on intentional nonadherence and 
unintentional nonadherence ranged from 0.616 to 0.777 and 
from 0.612 to 0.983, respectively. Cronbach’s alpha was 
0.563 and 0.694, respectively. Participants were divided 
into the following three groups according to medication 
adherence: “adherence”, in which they answered no for all 
six questions; “unintentional non-adherence”, in which they 
answered no for all the three intentional nonadherence items, 
but answered yes for any of unintentional nonadherence items; 
and “intentional nonadherence,” in which they answered yes 
for any of the three intentional non-adherence items.
Beliefs about medicines questionnaire
Beliefs about medication were measured using BMQ devel-
oped by Horne et al,16 which has been used in other Korean 
researches recently.7,24,25 Respondents answered ten questions 
that addressed necessity and concern, with each construct 
addressed by five items. A five-category ordered response 
set ranged from strongly agree (5) to strongly disagree (1). 
Two multiitem scales were created by summing responses 
to the raw items into a scale score, in which higher scores 
represented stronger beliefs. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients 
for necessity and concern were 0.810 and 0.692, respectively. 
Two factors were extracted in factor analysis, and they were 
the same constructs as those presented by Horne et al.
Self-efficacy
Self-efficacy was assessed using the Medication Adher-
ence Self-efficacy Scale-Revision (MASES-R) developed 
by Fernandez et al.26 This is a 13-item scale used to assess 
patients’ confidence in their ability to manage their antihy-
pertensive medications in various situations. Some examples 
include “when busy at home”, “when there is no one to 
remind you”, or “when you do not have any symptoms”. The 
four-category ordered response set ranged from extremely 
sure (5) to not at all sure (1), and a multiitem construct was 
created by summing the 13 items into a score. Cronbach’s 
alpha coefficient for MASES-R was 0.956.
Blood pressure
Using a standard protocol, blood pressure was measured with 
a calibrated mercury sphygmomanometer and stethoscope. 
The survey interview lasted for 20–30 minutes. After finishing 
the survey, the subjects rested for 5 minutes, after which the 
blood pressure was measured in the right arm with the subject 
seated. A second blood pressure reading was taken 5 minutes 
later. The mean of the two results was used in analyzing data. 
Blood pressure was considered to be uncontrolled if either 
the mean systolic pressure was $140 mmHg or the mean 
diastolic pressure was $90 mmHg, according to the Eighth 
Joint National Committee recommendations.1
lifestyle
Respondents answered six questions about lifestyle, includ-
ing low-salt diet, low-fat diet, exercise, networking with other 
people, moderate drinking, and smoking. The five-category 
ordered response set ranged from always do (5) to never do 
(1), and the sum of the six items was used in the analysis.
The framework of the current study is presented in 
Figure 1.
Analysis
All variables were compared among the adherence, uninten-
tional nonadherence, and intentional nonadherence groups. 
Analysis of variance was used for continuous variables, and 
chi-square tests were used for categorical variables. Blood 
pressure was also compared, according to adherence groups, 
using analysis of variance. Subjects were divided into two 
groups according to blood pressure control and compared using 
a chi-square test, and linear trend in proportions according to 
adherence groups was also tested using the chi-square test.
Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the rela-
tionship between medication adherence and lifestyle. Because 
lifestyle differed considerably according to gender, data were 
stratified by gender, and coefficients of unintentional nonadher-
ence and intentional nonadherence groups were estimated as 
 
adjusted for sociodemographic, illness-related status, polyp-
harmacy, and regimen complexity-related variables.
These factors were also examined for effect on BMQ and 
self-efficacy, using multiple regression analysis.
SEM was used to assess the effects of BMQ and self-
efficacy on the two types of nonadherence and the interrela-
tionship between unintentional and intentional nonadherence. 
The first SEM analysis investigated the impact of necessity, 
concern, and self-efficacy on unintentional adherence, and 
the second analysis looked at the effect of the same variables 
on intentional adherence. Because intentional adherence 
could be mediated by unintentional adherence, indirect 
effects were also considered. Because outcome variables 
were binary, we employed the robust, diagonally weighted

Results
Of the 401 subjects (mean age 74.5 years) who participated in 
the survey, 303 (75.6%) were female. A majority of partici-
pants had a monthly household income of ,1,000,000 KRW 
(331, 82.5%) and less than elementary school (335, 83.5%) 
education. Of the total number of subjects, 188 (46.5%) 
lived with their spouse. The mean time since diagnosis was 
8.7 years, suggesting a relatively long period. Most partici-
pants took their medication only once a day (367, 91.5%). On 
an average, they were prescribed 3.1 medications, including 
drugs other than antihypertensive. Over one-half (229, 
57.1%) of them had other diseases besides hypertension, and 
184 (45.9%) rated their health as bad.
According to their self-report, 182 (45.6%) of subjects 
were in the adherence group, 107 (26.7%) in the unintentional 
nonadherence group, and 112 (27.9%) in the intentional 
nonadherence group. Medication adherence significantly 
varied with household income, with respondents with a 
higher household income being more likely to be nonadherent 
(P=0.038). Other illness-related or polypharmacy or regimen 
complexity-related variables were not significantly associated 
with medication adherence (Table 1).
The mean scores for necessity and concern were 16.5 
and 12.4, respectively. The concern scores did not differ 
significantly among the groups (P=0.441). The necessity 
scores of participants in the adherence group were higher 
than those in the intentional nonadherence group (P=0.001), 
but not in the unintentional adherence group (P=0.904). The 
mean score for self-efficacy was 39.3 and was significantly 
related to medication adherence (P,0.001). Compared with 
the adherence group, both the nonadherence groups had lower 
self-efficacy (P,0.001), but the two nonadherence groups

did not differ from one another on self-efficacy (P=0.226) 
(Table 2).
Systolic blood pressures of patients in the adherence 
group (130.5 mmHg) were lower than those of patients in the 
intentional nonadherence group (135.6 mmHg, P=0.003) but 
not in the unintentional nonadherence group (131.5 mmHg, 
P=0.771). Diastolic blood pressure did not differ significantly 
between the three groups (P=0.095) (Figure 2). The blood pres-
sure control rates, the percentage of subjects attaining the target 
blood pressure, did not differ significantly between the groups 
(adherence =47.3%, unintentional nonadherence =43.9%, and 
intentional nonadherence group =42.9%). The linear trend of 
blood pressure control rate according to adherence groups was 
not significant (P=0.466) (Table 3).
After controlling for sociodemographics, illness-related 
factors, polypharmacy, and regimen complexity, the life-
style scores in male respondents did not differ significantly 
among the three groups. In contrast, female respondents in 
the intentional nonadherence group had significantly lower 
lifestyle scores than those in the adherence group (P=0.036) 
(Table 4).
Associations between sociodemographics, illness-
related factors, polypharmacy/regimen complexity-related 
variables, social cognitive factors ascertained by BMQ, and 
self-efficacy assessment are presented in Table 5. None of 
the variables were significantly related to necessity and self-
efficacy. However, concern scores of patients whose house-
hold income was ,1 million KRW were higher than those 
of patients whose household income was 1–2 million KRW 
(P=0.048), but did not differ from those of patients whose 
household income was .2 million KRW (P=0.876).
The relationships between the social cognitive factors and 
self-efficacy and nonadherence were tested using SEM analy-
sis. The results suggest that the model fits well with the data, 
presenting adequate fit indices: χ2=122.644, TLI =0.972, 
CFI =0.903, WRMR =0.775, and RMSEA =0.045.
Figure 3 depicts the standardized path coefficients and 
their significance, and Table 6 presents indirect effects of 
necessity, concern, and self-efficacy on intentional nonad-
herence mediated by unintentional nonadherence. Necessity 
and self-efficacy were found to have a significant direct 
influence on unintentional nonadherence behaviors (neces-
sity β=-0.171, P=0.019; self-efficacy β=-0.433, P,0.001); 
concern was not statistically significant (β=-0.009, P=0.909). 
Necessity was found to have significant direct and indirect 
impact on intentional adherence (direct β=-0.275, P=0.002; 
indirect β=-0.113, P=0.036). Self-efficacy had no significant 
direct effect on intentional nonadherence. The only signifi-
cant indirect effect it had was on unintentional adherence 
(direct β=-0.055, P=0.515; indirect β=-0.286, P,0.001). 
Concern had no significant influence on intentional or on 
unintentional adherence (direct β=0.132 0.132, P=0.151; 
indirect β=-0.006, P=0.909).
Discussion
In this study, medication adherence and its related factors in 
elderly hypertensive patients were assessed using a cross-
sectional survey design.
Self-report in such a survey is not a quantifiable mea-
sure of adherence, and it is also subject to recall bias and 
overestimation of adherence.29 However, in the outpatient 
setting or community-based programs, self-report is a very 
useful, efficient, and appropriate method to differentiate 
types of nonadherence and assess patients’ knowledge or 
beliefs about medication.29,30 Only 45.4% of the elderly 
patients with hypertension in our study were adherent to their 
medication, indicating that improved adherence still needs 
to be addressed in the management of high blood pressure. 
The percentage of those who admitted to any of the uninten-
tional nonadherence behaviors was 48.9%, whereas 27.9% 
admitted to one or more of the intentional nonadherence 
behaviors. Thus, most of those in the intentional nonadher-
ence group also had unintentional nonadherence behaviors, 
as has been reported by other groups, where unintentional 
and intentional nonadherence were in the proportion of two 
or three to one.11,13,31

Some studies have shown that patients’ concepts of 
necessity or concern as well as self-efficacy are also related 
to unintentional nonadherence.9,13 In patients with chronic 
disease, perceived need, concern, and affordability affect 
intentional nonadherence, and they also affect uninten-
tional nonadherence, such that the unintentional behavior 
is thought to mediate intentional nonadherence.13 In that 
study, unintentional and intentional nonadherence were 
found to be closely related, and unintentional nonadher-
ence behaviors sometimes appeared to be a risk factor for 
intentional nonadherence. Others have suggested that during 
occasional episodes of unintentional nonadherence, patients 
may be testing a medication’s effectiveness or assessing 
their symptom status without taking the medication.21–23 
Some patients may also report unintentional nonadherence 
instead of intentional nonadherence because forgetfulness 
or carelessness is considered more socially acceptable than 
deliberately not taking medications.32
Self-efficacy is related to various health behaviors needed 
to manage chronic diseases33 and has been shown to be related 
to adherence to medication in patients with hypertension.26 
In addition to a direct effect on medication adherence, it 
also mediated the effect of depression on adherence among 
patients with hypertension.19 Self-efficacy is reported to 
serve as a mediator in the relationship between depres-
sion, social support, and type D personality and medication 
adherence or clinical outcome in diabetes mellitus, human 
immunodeficiency virus, and acute coronary syndrome 
patients.20,34,35 Self-efficacy was known to have protective 
role and when people lack a sense of self-efficacy, they

may not be able to manage aversive situations successfully, 
even though they have enough knowledge and possess the 
requisite skills.18,36
Self-efficacy can be defined as a dynamic condition that 
can be reinforced through past experience of health behav-
ior, but most hypertensive patients do not have any clinical 
symptoms and for this reason do not have immediate positive 
reward from taking the medicine. Most hypertensive patients 
do not present any immediate negative symptoms when not 
taken, nor does it cause any perceived negative consequences 
that may promote positive motives for medication adherence. 
Patients need to be aware of the long-term effect of medica-
tion, social and self-regulatory skills, and social supports.36 
The patient–provider relationship is really important as other 
chronic diseases35 and the unintentional nonadherence can be 
used as a marker of lower self-efficacy. In contrast to find-
ings of the present study, some investigators have suggested 
that, in addition to necessity, concern about adverse effects 
or medication abuse relates to both intentional and unin-
tentional nonadherence.13,31 It may be that the present study 
did not demonstrate an important effect of concern because 
the participants were elderly, with long-standing disease. If 
they had a lot of experience taking medication of any type, 
concern may have been less of a factor in adherence than 
necessity and self-efficacy.
The issue of intentional nonadherence tends to be too 
frequently ignored by health care professionals.37 Many 
general practitioners admit that they would like to help their 
patients with this issue but are unable to do so.38 In addition, 
interventions that are acknowledged to be effective may be 
difficult to implement because of the time and cost involved.39 
Interventions for unintentional nonadherence, such as some-
one helping the patient take the medicine or sending text 
messages, were found to be easier to implement.37 However, 
the present study result suggests that beliefs about medication 
affect both intentional and unintentional nonadherence;

hence, interventions that do not address patients’ beliefs 
may not be effective.13
Adherence, as measured by questionnaire, has been 
shown to be related to blood pressure control,29 but this 
was not found in the present study. Although patients in the 
nonadherence groups sometimes did not take their medicine, 
it is conceivable that they did take it on the day of survey, 
which may have acutely affected their blood pressure. The 
cross-sectional design has some limitations in investigating 
the relationship between adherence to medication and blood 
pressure control. However, systolic blood pressure in the 
intentional nonadherence group was higher than that in the 
other two groups, suggesting that there may be a relationship. 
Other studies should be designed to allow better assessment 
of the usual blood pressure, for example, measuring it for 
24 hours or sequentially over a certain period of time.
In the present study, there was a negative association 
between intentional nonadherence and healthy behaviors only 
among women participants. This may illustrate the “healthy 
adherer effect”, in which patients who are adherent to their 
prescribed medications are also more likely to have healthy 
behaviors.2 The association between healthy behaviors, that 
is, lifestyle factors, and medication adherence should be 
further studied.
This study has several limitations. Beliefs about medi-
cines and self-efficacy are both dynamic traits and those, 
which could be affected by feedback, from individual medica-
tion experiences. However, such changes over time cannot be 
examined in a cross-sectional design. The mediation effect 
of unintentional nonadherence also needs to be evaluated 
longitudinally in a cohort study. Cronbach’s alpha value was 
0.563 in our intentional nonadherence survey measure, but 
with same measure in community using randomized sampling 
method for stroke and hypertensive patient study showed 
0.722 and 0.781 with acceptable reliability.7,40 Although 
adherence to medication is known to be related to comorbid-
ity, drug count, or dosing frequency,7,24,41 the present survey 
did not assess the type of comorbid disease or the number of 
hypertensive drugs each participant took; hence, these factors 
could not be analyzed. In addition, it was not known when 
the blood pressure was measured in relation to the time the 
subject may have taken their medication. This issue should 
be considered in the design of future studies.
This study was performed to examine medication-
taking behaviors, including unintentional and intentional 
nonadherence, and related factors in elderly patients with 
hypertension. The results show the effects of necessity, 
concern, and self-efficacy on the two types of nonadher-
ence, demonstrating the interrelationship of the two types 
of nonadherent behavior.
Conclusion
Unintentional nonadherence can easily be regarded as acciden-
tal, as opposed to the active nature of intentional nonadherence.

However, the value of recognizing unintentional behavior lies 
in its potential prognostic significance. Unintentional nonad-
herence should be regularly monitored and managed. Inter-
ventions addressing cognitive factors, such as beliefs about 
medicine or self-efficacy, are relatively difficult to implement, 
but are essential to improve medication adherence.

Patient Preference and Adherence is an international, peer-reviewed, 
open access journal that focuses on the growing importance of patient 
 
preference and adherence throughout the therapeutic continuum. Patient 
satisfaction, acceptability, quality of life, compliance, persistence and their 
role in  
developing new therapeutic modalities and compounds to optimize 
clinical  
outcomes for existing disease states are major areas of interest for 
the  
journal. This journal has been accepted for indexing on PubMed Central. 
The  
manuscript management system is completely online and includes a very 
quick and fair peer-review system, which is all easy to use. Visit http://www.
