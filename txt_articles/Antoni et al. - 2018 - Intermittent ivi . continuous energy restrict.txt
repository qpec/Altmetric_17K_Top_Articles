Abstract
The intermittent energy restriction (IER) approach to weight loss involves short periods of substantial (>70 %) energy restriction (ER)
interspersed with normal eating. Studies to date comparing IER to continuous energy restriction (CER) have predominantly measured fasting
indices of cardiometabolic risk. This study aimed to compare the effects of IER and CER on postprandial glucose and lipid metabolism
following matched weight loss. In all, twenty-seven (thirteen male) overweight/obese participants (46 (SEM 3) years, 30·1 (SEM 1·0) kg/m2) who
were randomised to either an IER intervention (2638 kJ for 2 d/week with an overall ER of 22 (SEM 0·3) %, n 15) or a CER intervention (2510 kJ
below requirements with overall ER of 23 (SEM 0·8) %) completed the study. Postprandial responses to a test meal (over 360 min) and changes
in anthropometry (fat mass, fat-free mass, circumferences) were assessed at baseline and upon attainment of 5 % weight loss, following a 7-d
period of weight stabilisation. The study found no statistically significant difference in the time to attain a 5 % weight loss between groups
(median 59 d (interquartile range (IQR) 41–80) and 73 d (IQR 48–128), respectively, P = 0·246), or in body composition (P ≥ 0·437). For
postprandial measures, neither diet significantly altered glycaemia (P = 0·266), whereas insulinaemia was reduced comparatively (P = 0·903).
The reduction in C-peptide tended (P = 0·057) to be greater following IER (309 128 (SEM 23 268) to 247 781 (SEM 20 709) pmol × 360 min/l) v.
CER (297 204 (SEM 25 112) to 301 655 (SEM 32 714) pmol × 360 min/l). The relative reduction in TAG responses was greater (P = 0·045) following
IER (106 (SEM 30) to 68 (SEM 15) mmol × 360 min/l) compared with CER (117 (SEM 43) to 130 (SEM 31) mmol × 360 min/l). In conclusion, these
preliminary findings highlight underlying differences between IER and CER, including a superiority of IER in reducing postprandial lipaemia,
which now warrant targeted mechanistic evaluation within larger study cohorts.
Key words: Intermittent fasting: TAG: Glucose: Lipids: Humans
The development of overweight/obesity is closely associated
with numerous inter-related metabolic complications including
insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia. These in turn increase an
individual’s risk of type 2 diabetes and CVD, prevalence rates of
which are rising in congruence with weight trends(1). Glucose
and lipid homoeostasis can be improved through weight loss(2)
which is most commonly advised via a modest (daily) con-
tinuous energy restriction (CER)(3). Intermittent energy restric-
tion (IER) has received considerable recent interest as an
alternative dietary strategy for weight loss and entails inter-
mittent periods of substantial energy restriction interspersed
with periods of normal eating(4).
Previous studies comparing the effects of IER to CER on
cardiometabolic risk factors have found them to have equiva-
lent effects on most metabolic outcomes(5–7). There is some
suggestion that IER (2 consecutive days of 70 % energy
restriction (ER)) may elicit greater benefits than CER on proxies
of hepatic insulin sensitivity(5,6), however, no study to date has
controlled for the extent of weight loss; a confounding factor
from the perspective of metabolic comparisons. In addition, the
majority of studies have conducted steady-state assessments,
with only fasting blood measurements taken which is not truly
representative as humans spend most of their day in a post-
prandial state; a dynamic, non-steady-state condition. Further-
more, impairments in postprandial glucose and lipid handling
are widely regarded as clinically significant CVD risk factors(8,9)
and as such must also be considered within metabolic com-
parisons. One uncontrolled study by Heilbronn et al.(10)
demonstrated a decline in glucose tolerance after 3 weeks of
IER (alternate days of total ER) among healthy and overweight
women. However, baseline and post-treatment postprandial
assessments were conducted following 12 h and 36 h fasting

 periods, respectively. Prolonged (36 h) fasting intervals are
known to impair glucose tolerance(11), and as such, the
observed decline in glucose tolerance may not reflect a true
chronic treatment effect. In sum, there is very little known about
the effects of IER on postprandial metabolism.
The present study, which was conducted as a randomised
controlled dietary intervention in overweight/obese men and
women, aimed to compare the effects of IER v. CER on post-
prandial glucose and lipid responses to a liquid mixed test
meal challenge following matched 5 % weight loss. Changes in
fasting cardiometabolic disease risk factors, resting energy
expenditure (REE) and substrate oxidation were also assessed.
Methods
Participants
Overweight
and
obese
participants
(BMI >25kg/m2)
aged
18–65 years were recruited to the study from Surrey (UK). All
participants had an elevated waist circumference of >94cm for
men and >80cm for women. Participants were weight-stable
(±2kg) over the preceding 3 months and had no significant
medical history. To control for the potential influence of the men-
strual cycle between visits, female participants were either post-
menopausal (defined as absence of menses for ≥1 year) or taking
oral contraceptives. The study obtained a favourable opinion from
the University of Surrey ethics committee (UEC/2014/140/FHMS)
and was conducted in accordance with the guidelines laid down in
the Declaration of Helsinki. ISRCT registry no.: ISRCTN13687043.
The study ran between May 2015 and August 2016.
Sample size considerations
On the basis of our previous acute observations(11), changes in
postprandial lipaemia was selected the primary outcome, with
the a priori hypothesis that the relative improvement in lipaemia
would be greater following weight loss via IER. As no compar-
able study has been performed, comparing the effects of IER v.
CER following matched weight loss, prospective power calcula-
tions were not possible. To assess the possibility of type 2 error,
retrospective power calculations were conducted for a secondary
outcome measure, postprandial glucose. For the incremental
AUC (iAUC) for plasma glucose, retrospective power calculations
determined that at a two-sided 0·05 significance level, the study
had 80 % power to detect a mean difference of 120mmol×
360min/l between treatment groups (IER v. CER), based on a
pooled standard deviation of 105mmol× 360min/l.
Study design
The study was a randomised, parallel-armed, comparison
between IER and CER. Participants were stratified by age (<42/
≥42 years; mid-point of the recruitment range), BMI (<30/
≥30 kg/m2), sex, ethnicity and homoeostasis model assessment
of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; <1/ ≥1) to ensure balanced
group allocation, with matched pairs randomly assigned 1:1 to
the interventions. The CER intervention served as the ‘standard
treatment’ control, compliant with UK National Institute of
Clinical Excellence (NICE) obesity guidelines(3).
To control for the degree of weight loss, study measurements
were taken at baseline and after participants had attained a 5 %
weight loss, a threshold adjudged to have a clinically significant
impact on cardiometabolic risk factors(12).
Dietary interventions
Estimated energy requirements were calculated using the Henry
predictive equation(13) for BMR multiplied by an appropriate
physical activity factor based on self-reported occupational and
leisure activity levels(14). Healthy eating advice (compliant with
UK guidelines) and individualised food portions lists were
provided by an appropriately trained study investigator (R. A.).
Participants were only informed of the comparison diet once
they had completed the study.
Intermittent energy restriction diet. On 2 consecutive days of
the week, participants consumed four commercially available

energy
formula-based
Food
Packs
(2638 kJ: 38, 36 and 26 % of total energy as carbohydrate, pro-
tein and fat) which delivered approximately 25 % of their esti-
mated euenergetic needs. Consecutive days were chosen to
mirror that of previously published work by Harvie et al.(5,6).
On the remaining 5 d (feed days), participants’ food intake was
self-selected, but they were asked to consume an euenergetic
healthy diet. Averaged overall prescribed ER was 22 (SEM 0·3) %.
Continuous energy restriction diet. Participants assigned to the
CER diet were advised to consume a daily hypoenergetic diet of
2510 kJ below their estimated energy requirements(3). All foods
were self-selected by participants. Averaged overall prescribed ER
was 23 (SEM 0·8) %, comparable with the IER intervention.
Laboratory visits
All participants initially undertook a 7-d baseline period during
which time they were required to record habitual dietary intakes.
At the end of this baseline, participants attended the Surrey
Clinical Research Centre for initial measurements. Participants
were instructed to abstain from alcohol and strenuous exercise
for 48h before the visit, and were provided with a standardised
pasta-based microwaveable meal (2377 kJ, 75 g carbohydrate,
16 g fat, 24 g protein), which they consumed before 20.00 hours
on the preceding evening as the macronutrient composition of
an evening meal can affect metabolic responses on the following
day(15). Participants arrived at the research unit following a 12-h
overnight, water-only fast. Body weight and body composition
(estimated by multi-frequency bioimpedance) were recorded
using the Tanita BC420MA (Tanita Corp.) alongside measures of
waist and hip circumference. After a period of rest, blood pres-
sure measurements were taken in duplicate (UA-767; A&D) and
the mean recorded. Following this, fasted resting measurements
of energy expenditure and substrate utilisation were taken via
indirect calorimetry. An indwelling cannula was then inserted
following which the first (fasted) sample was taken. A liquid
mixed test meal was provided (400 ml Fortisip; Nutricia: 2510 kJ,
74 g carbohydrate (49 % of total energy), 24 g protein (16%)
and 23 g fat (35 %)) which participants consumed within 5 min.

 This homogenous liquid meal was used for the purpose of
standardisation, to minimise potential variance in postprandial
response associated with factors such as cooking/food prepara-
tion and chewing rate. In addition, its composition is reflective of
the macronutrient proportions of typical western dietary intakes.
Serial blood samples were taken at regular intervals over the next
360min (from the first mouthful) to assess postprandial changes
in glucose, insulin, C-peptide, TAG, NEFA and 3-hydroxybutyrate
(3-OHB). After the initial visit, both groups commenced their
respective diets whilst maintaining habitual activity patterns.
Participants returned to the research centre for repeated mea-
surements once the 5 % target was achieved. They consumed the
same standardised evening meal and were given identical pre-
visit instructions with regards to alcohol and exercise. Participants
in both groups abstained from any form of ER for ≥7 d before the
repeat study visit to mitigate the effects of acute ER on the
metabolic outcomes. Participants did not complete diet diaries
during this period; however, intake and weight were regularly
reviewed during this period to ensure adherence.
Monitoring and compliance
Participants received fortnightly motivational contact from the
study investigators via phone, email and/or texts in addition to
monthly face-to-face clinic appointments, where weight was
recorded. Every 2 weeks, participants were sent online ques-
tionnaires which asked them to self-report their morning fasted
weight and, for IER participants, ER-day intakes. A compliant ER
day was defined as energy intake ≤3347 kJ, which corresponds
to the very-low energy diet threshold defined by NICE(3). The
frequency of weight monitoring increased as participants
approached their 5 % target. All participants also completed 7-d
diet diaries and self-reported physical activity levels midway
(about 2·5 % weight loss) and as they were approaching their
5 % weight-loss target
Blood biochemistry
Blood samples were collected into potassium EDTA (for plasma
lipid and insulin analysis) and sodium oxalate (for plasma glucose
analysis). For the measurement of plasma C-peptide, blood was
collected into EDTA containing 200 kallikrein inhibiting units of
aprotinin per ml of whole blood. Samples were centrifuged for
15min at 2500rpm and separated; aliquots were then stored at
−20°C or −80°C (for 3-OHB analysis). Plasma insulin was measured
using RIA (Millipore; intra/inter-assay CV 8 and 4%); C-peptide by
RIA (Millipore; intra/inter-assay CV 6 and 8%); glucose, TAG and
NEFA using the ILAB 650 photometric auto-analyser (Instru-
mentation Laboratory; intra/inter-assay CV all <6%); and 3-OHB
using the Cobas MIRA photometric auto-analyser (Roche; intra/
inter-assay CV <5 and <6%). All samples from an individual par-
ticipant were included in the same assay.
Indirect calorimetry
REE and substrate utilisation were calculated using data
obtained from a gaseous exchange monitor (ISGEM319; GEM-
Nutrition), an open-circuit indirect calorimeter based on the
ventilated flow-through technique. Following a 30-min period
of rest, measurements were taken over 20 min and in accor-
dance with methodological recommendations by Compher
et al.(16). REE was calculated utilising the modified Weir equa-
tion(17) and substrate utilisation implied from the RQ (VCO2/
VO2). To permit comparisons between individuals of varying
body masses, REE was also normalised for estimated metabo-
lically active mass (REE/fat-free mass + 18 kg(18)).
Dietary analyses
All
dietary
analyses
were
carried
out
in
Diet
Plan
7
(Forestfield Software) using the McCance and Widdowson’s
composition of foods integrated data set. Participants recorded
7-d food intake in validated diet diaries(19). Intakes were then
averaged. Data for participants who did not complete a baseline
diary and/or at least one of their two diaries whilst dieting were
omitted completely from analyses.
Data manipulation and statistical analyses. AUC (for NEFA
and 3-OHB) and iAUC (for all other metabolites) were calcu-
lated using the trapezoid method, subtracting the area below
baseline for iAUC. LDL-cholesterol was calculated using the
Friedewald equation(20). HOMA-IR and %B were calculated
using the HOMA2 online calculator (https://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/
homacalculator/) as proxies for insulin sensitivity and β-cell
function, respectively.
Data were statistically analysed using SPSS version 23 (IBM).
Data were first checked for normality using the Shapiro–Wilks
test, with non-normally distributed data normalised via log
transformation where possible to permit parametric testing. The
primary analysis was an ANCOVA between the dietary inter-
vention groups with post-treatment values as the dependent
variable, and baseline values of each parameter as the covari-
ate. This is recommended statistical method (in terms of bias,
precision and power) for the analysis of continuous outcomes
in randomised studies with a single post-treatment measure-
ment previously measured at baseline(21). Between-group
factors which could have influenced study outcomes (age,
sex, body fat and metabolic syndrome status) were entered
systematically into the outcome models, but none were found
to be statistically significant. To then enter all of them at once
into the models would have invited spurious results and thus
these factors were not included as covariates in the final mod-
els. The Mann–Whitney U test was used as the non-parametric
alternative to ANCOVA. Differences between intervention
groups at baseline were assessed using independent t tests for
continuous variables or the χ2 test for categorical variables. No
significant baseline differences were found unless otherwise
stated. A paired t test (or non-parametric Wilcoxon’s signed-
rank test) was used to assess the change between baseline and
post intervention values within each dietary intervention group.
Correlations between changes in metabolic and dietary intake
variables
were
explored
using
Pearson’s
(parametric)
or
Spearman’s (non-parametric) tests as appropriate. Statistical
significance was accepted at P < 0·05, and a statistical trend at
P = 0·05–1·0. Summary measures are presented as mean values
with their standard errors (for parametric data) or medians and
interquartile ranges (IQR, for non-parametric data).

 Results
Participant baseline characteristics
Seven participants allocated to the CER intervention did not start
the study. Of the forty-one participants (IER = 24, CER= 17) who
started the study, twenty-seven (IER= 15, CER= 12) attained their
5 % weight-loss target. The consort diagram is presented in Fig. 1.
Baseline characteristics of the twenty-seven study completers
are presented in Table 1. The groups were matched for age,
BMI, adiposity, sex, metabolic syndrome classification and were
primarily Caucasian. In all, twelve participants withdrew from
the study due to scheduling conflicts (IER = 1), bereavement
(IER = 1),
dental
problems
(IER = 1),
problems
tolerating
(IER = 4) or adhering to (CER = 2) their diet, or were lost to
follow up (IER = 2, CER = 1). Two CER participants were unable
to attain a 5 % weight loss within the maximum timeframe
(9 months) and so were withdrawn from the study. Non-
completers
were
significantly
younger
than
completers
(27 (SEM 3) v. 45 (SEM 3) years; P < 0·001, independent t test),
no other significant differences were noted.
Changes in body composition and circumferences
Mean percentage weight loss was 5·3 (SEM 0·3) % in the IER group
and 5·0 (SEM 0·3) % in the CER group (P = 0·446, ANCOVA). The
accompanying changes in body composition were also com-
parable between the groups (P ≥ 0·437, ANCOVA) and are
reported in Table 2. It took IER participants a median of 59d
(IQR: 41–80) to attain their 5 % weight-loss target and CER par-
ticipants 73 d (IQR: 48–128), which was not statistically different
between groups (P = 0·246, Mann–Whitney U test).
Dietary intakes and physical activity
Changes in dietary intake are reported in Table 3. By the end
of the intervention the reductions in energy intake were
significantly greater in the IER group (mean difference: 1081 kJ;
95 % CI −1900, −263; P = 0·012 ANCOVA, d = 1·21), with a
similar tendency noted for total carbohydrate intake (mean
difference: −28 g; 95 % CI −57, 1; P = 0·054 ANCOVA, d = 0·90).
Adherence to the IER protocol (i.e. 2 substantial ER days/week)
was high (93 (SEM 4) %), and were most frequently completed
on consecutive days (86 (SEM 7) %). Physical activity levels
remained stable in both groups across the study.
Fasting biochemistry and physiological markers
Changes in fasting biochemistry and physiological markers are
reported in Table 4.
There were no significant between-group differences for
changes in all fasting biochemical measures (all P ≥ 0·147,
ANCOVA). Within the IER group, there was a small increase in

 fasting glucose (P = 0·008, paired t test) post-weight loss,
whereas a trend in favour of reduced plasma NEFA was also
found (P = 0·056, paired t test).
The IER group exhibited a significantly greater reduction in sys-
tolic blood pressure (mean difference −6mmHg; 95% CI −11, −1;
P=0·020 ANCOVA, d=1·17), whereas the decreases in diastolic
blood pressure were comparable between groups (P=0·691,
ANCOVA). A positive relationship between the changes in energy
intake and systolic blood pressure was found (r 0·461, P=0·047).
There were no significant differences between groups for
changes in REE (P = 0·205, ANCOVA), although a trend in
favour of a reduction was observed following IER (P = 0·058,
paired t test). Similar within-group trends were noted when REE
was normalised for metabolically active mass, whereas the
between-group differences were strengthened (mean differ-
ence −7·28 kJ/kg metabolically active mass/d; 95 % CI −15·07,
0·510; P = 0·067 ANCOVA, d = 0·97).
The relative change in RQ was not significantly different
between the two diets (P = 0·148, Mann–Whitney U test)
although a significant within-group decline in fasting RQ
was noted in the IER group (P = 0·045, Wilcoxon’s signed-
ranks test).

 Postprandial lipid metabolism
Postprandial lipid parameters before and after the dietary inter-
ventions are presented in Fig. 2, and as averaged hourly iAUC in
the online Supplementary Fig. S1. The relative reduction in
postprandial TAG was significantly greater following IER v.
CER (P = 0·045 ANCOVA, d = 0·83). The log-transformed mean
difference
between
groups
was
−0·112 mmol× 360 min/l
(95 % CI −0·221, −0·003). A trend in favour of a positive rela-
tionship between decreases in incremental TAG and RQ was
found (r 0·34, P = 0·06). For postprandial NEFA, there were no
significant between-group differences (P = 0·410, Mann–Whitney
U test), although, a tendency for reduced NEFA AUC was
observed within the CER group (P = 0·059, Wilcoxon’s signed-
ranks test). No significant between group differences (P = 0·618,
ANCOVA) or within-group changes (P ≥ 0·248, paired t tests) in
postprandial 3-OHB responses were found.
Postprandial glucose metabolism
Postprandial glycaemic indices before and after the dietary
interventions are presented in Fig. 3. For postprandial glucose
responses, no significant between-group differences (P = 0·266,
ANCOVA) or within-group changes (P ≥ 0·252, paired t tests)
were observed. Postprandial insulinaemia was reduced com-
paratively in both groups (P = 0·903, ANCOVA). On the other
hand, postprandial C-peptide was reduced following IER but
not CER (Ptrend =0·057 ANCOVA, d = 0·81), with a mean
difference between groups of −61769 pmol × 360 min/l (95 % CI
−127 496, 3957).
Discussion
Findings from the present study highlight underlying differ-
ences between IER and CER with respect to their effects on
postprandial glucose and lipid metabolism following matched
5 % weight loss. These data are novel and as such, there are no
directly comparative data in the literature.
In our previous work we have reported that acutely, 1 d of
substantial 75 % ER reduced incremental TAG responses by
approximately 60 %(11). Chronically, the present study found
approximately 40 % reduction in incremental responses following
5 % weight loss achieved through IER. This finding has the
potential to be of clinical importance based on evidence from
large prospective cohort studies highlights an independent link
between elevated postprandial TAG and CVD risk(22–24). More-
over, postprandial TAG responses have also been shown to
predict the presence of coronary artery disease, with one study in
adult males finding that the magnitude of lipaemia was approxi-
mately 41 % greater among cases v. controls(25), and has been
positively correlated with markers of atherosclerotic progres-
sion(26). The mechanisms underlying these associations include
the direct interaction between TAG-rich lipoprotein (TRL) rem-
nants and the arterial wall, as well as indirect mechanisms, such
as alterations in LDL particle size(27).
Postprandial assessments were limited to measuring changes
in absolute substrate concentrations after a single meal, and
which represent the balance but not the rate (or source) of TRL
appearance or clearance, and as such their relative contribu-
tions
cannot
be
ascertained.

 differences between the dietary groups in changes in post-
prandial hepatic fatty acid partitioning (3-OHB) or NEFA
which might have otherwise explained these findings. Reduc-
tions in waist circumference were also comparable between
groups, but this cannot differentiate between changes in
intra-hepatocellular or visceral stores which can augment
postprandial
lipaemia
by
driving
increased
VLDL–TAG
production(28,29). Interestingly,
a within-group increase
in
whole-body fat oxidation was observed following IER but not
CER in the present study, although not statistically different
between groups. Nonetheless, it is perhaps not unreasonable
to speculate that the repeated substantive periods of ER
experienced during IER may have up-regulated pathways
associated with fatty acid metabolism and uptake in skeletal
muscle and/or adipose tissues, manifesting as changes in
basal substrate oxidation and postprandial lipaemia. These
preliminary
results
justify
more
detailed
investigations
into
the
kinetics
of
TAG
metabolism,
using
targeted
methodology.
Although insulin responses to the meal challenge were
reduced comparatively following weight loss via both IER
and CER, however, using concurrent measurements of both
insulin and C-peptide, the study does propose differences
between the two weight-loss diets in terms of underlying
mechanism. C-peptide undergoes negligible extraction by the
liver and constant peripheral clearance, thus making it a more
direct marker of insulin secretion than circulating insulin(30).
Following CER, insulinaemia was reduced whereas post-
prandial C-peptide was unaltered, which suggest an increase in
hepatic insulin clearance. By contrast, postprandial C-peptide
responses following IER may reveal reduced insulin secretion
over the first 2 h of the 6-h postprandial period. Although this
did not ultimately result in a significant alteration in overall
glucose iAUC, the underlying mechanism and biological
significance merits further evaluation.
At baseline, approximately half of IER participants were
either pre-hypertensive (120–139/80–89 mmHg) or hyperten-
sive (>140–159/90–99 mmHg). Following weight loss, all but
one IER participants became normotensive (<120/80 mmHg).
In contrast, the proportion of participants who were pre- or
hypertensive (approximately 30 %) did not change significantly
following the CER diet. The shift observed in the IER group was
largely driven by a reduction in systolic blood pressure, which
was not significantly altered by CER. A positive relationship was

 found between the magnitude of the reduction in systolic blood
pressure and the degree of ER, which as discussed further in the
next paragraph was greater in the IER group. It should be noted
that the numerical trends in favour of higher baseline systolic
blood pressures within the IER group would have been adjus-
ted for by the ANCOVA statistical method. To date, previously
published comparison studies have found no significant dif-
ferences between the two diets(5–7); thus, these findings are
unexpected and necessitate replication before any conclusions
can be drawn and to exclude the possibility of type 1 error.
The time taken to achieve 5% weight loss was not statistically
different between groups, although, the IER group reported
greater relative reductions in energy (approximately 1081kJ/d)
driven by under-consumption on ‘feed’ days (where an euener-
getic diet was prescribed), which is in accordance with previous
research(5–7). Numerically, IER participants attained their weight-
loss target sooner (median 59 v. 73 d). Although type 2 error
cannot be disregarded, on the alternate side of the energy balance
equation, absolute REE was reduced by approximately 7%
(477kJ) following IER, but not CER which may have contributed to
these discrepancies between the dietary intake data and weight-
loss trajectories. Food dietary records are susceptible to under-
reporting(31), but this would have affected the validity of dietary
records of both groups. These data may also be indicative of subtle
alterations in physical activity thermogenesis which could not be
captured by the factorial approach implemented by the study.
Changes in body composition were comparable between groups,
however, when normalised for metabolically active mass, the
between-group differences in REE became more pronounced. In
the context of the existing literature, our data contrast with
Cattenaci’s recent study(32) which found that weight loss via IER
(alternating days of total ER and ad libitum intake) mitigated the
adaptive physiological reductions in REE that occur during weight
loss. However, the varying dietary protocols do not permit direct
comparisons between studies, with one important distinction here
being that participants under-consumed on ‘feed’ days so most
probably rarely attained energy balance.
There were some important caveats with IER, in that a higher
attrition rate was reported among participants who started the
intervention. Overall dropout rates were 34 % in the study
cohort as a whole, which exceeds that of previous studies
utilising analogous 2 ER days per week protocols where rates
have ranged from 21 to 23 %(5,6). This discrepancy can largely
be attributed to the study design, whereby participants were
assigned to the diet until a weight-loss target was achieved
rather than fixed duration of time. More recently, a study by
Trepanowski et al.(7) of alternate day ER also reported a higher
attrition rate among IER participants of 38 v. 29 % among CER

 participants. Put together, data from ours and Trepanowski’s
study do not support the popular notion that IER could prove
‘easier’ to follow than CER, warranting further investigation of
the factors that can influence the acceptability of IER amongst
the public. Among the twenty-four participants assigned to the
CER intervention, only seventeen started. The majority (five) of
the seven who did not start either declined to participate or
contact was lost. Participants were blinded to the comparison
diet which suggests that there was no bias to the IER diet per se,
but, the perceived lack of novelty may have contributed to the
drop outs in the CER group before commencing the diet.
The main strengths of the study were that weight loss as an
independent metabolic confounder, was controlled for, and the
study conducted dynamic, concurrent, assessments of post-
prandial glucose and lipid metabolism in addition to static,
steady-state
measurements.
Limitations
include
the
small
sample of both overweight and obese participants which can
increase the risk of type 1 and 2 errors, use of bioimpedance, and
that postprandial assessments were only conducted following a
single meal. Correlation analyses found no relationship between
the degree of ER to the degree of change in most outcome
measures (with the exception of systolic blood pressure). It
should be noted that the absence of a statistical relationship does
not rule out the absence of a potential effect of the greater overall
ER during IER to study findings. Lastly, physical activity levels
were only assessed via the factorial method, which is insensitive
to small changes in activity and is unable to differentiate between
the various components of energy expenditure.
In summary, our preliminary data suggest that the mode of ER
(intermittent but severe v. modest continuous) may have differ-
ential cardiometabolic effects, which in turn could be important to
long-term disease risk. Differences were observed between the
diets, particularly with regards to postprandial lipaemia which was
reduced to a greater extent following IER. In addition, these data
also reveal distinctions between IER and CER with regards to their
effects on insulin secretion dynamics, REE and blood pressure.
These data now warrant further investigation utilising targeted
methodology, and within distinct population groups such as
individuals with morbid obesity and established metabolic dis-
orders. Future studies should implement rigorous controls over
energy intake and expenditure to minimise the influence that
variances in these factors might have on study outcomes.
