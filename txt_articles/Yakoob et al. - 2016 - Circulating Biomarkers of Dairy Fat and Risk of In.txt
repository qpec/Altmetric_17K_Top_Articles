or decades, dietary recommendations for dairy foods have 
been based on predicted health effects of isolated individ-
ual nutrients, such as for bone health (eg, expected benefits of 
calcium and vitamin D), and cardiovascular disease (CVD; eg, 
expected harms of total fat and saturated fat). Based on these 
considerations, major dietary guidelines recommend low-fat 
dairy products and avoidance of whole-fat dairy.1 However, 
neither low-fat nor whole-fat dairy foods have major effects 
on traditional cardiovascular risk factors2 nor are appreciably 
linked to risk of coronary heart disease events.3 Interestingly, 
self-reported consumption of dairy foods has mixed associa-
tions with risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, without consistently 
different results for low-fat versus whole-fat products.4–6 For 
instance, several studies suggest that yogurt may be beneficial 
for diabetes mellitus,4–6 whereas some large studies,4,5 but not 
others,6 further suggest that cheese, which is highest in dairy 
fat, may also be protective.
Clinical Perspective on p 1654
Most previous investigations have relied on self-reported 
dietary information from questionnaires, which can be lim-
ited by errors in memory or subjective reporting, especially 
for dairy fat. In addition, dairy fat is consumed not only from 
whole foods such as milk, cheese, yogurt, and major dishes 
Background—In prospective studies, the relationship of self-reported consumption of dairy foods with risk of diabetes 
mellitus is inconsistent. Few studies have assessed dairy fat, using circulating biomarkers, and incident diabetes mellitus. 
We tested the hypothesis that circulating fatty acid biomarkers of dairy fat, 15:0, 17:0, and t-16:1n-7, are associated with 
lower incident diabetes mellitus.
Methods and Results—Among 3333 adults aged 30 to 75 years and free of prevalent diabetes mellitus at baseline, total 
plasma and erythrocyte fatty acids were measured in blood collected in 1989 to 1990 (Nurses’ Health Study) and 1993 
to 1994 (Health Professionals Follow-Up Study). Incident diabetes mellitus through 2010 was confirmed by a validated 
supplementary questionnaire based on symptoms, diagnostic tests, and medications. Risk was assessed by using Cox 
proportional hazards, with cohort findings combined by meta-analysis. During mean±standard deviation follow-up 
of 15.2±5.6 years, 277 new cases of diabetes mellitus were diagnosed. In pooled multivariate analyses adjusting for 
demographics, metabolic risk factors, lifestyle, diet, and other circulating fatty acids, individuals with higher plasma 15:0 
had a 44% lower risk of diabetes mellitus (quartiles 4 versus 1, hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.37–0.86; 
P-trend=0.01); higher plasma 17:0, 43% lower risk (hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.39–0.83; P-trend=0.01); 
and higher t-16:1n-7, 52% lower risk (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.33–0.70; P-trend <0.001). Findings 
were similar for erythrocyte 15:0, 17:0, and t-16:1n-7, although with broader confidence intervals that only achieved 
statistical significance for 17:0.
Conclusions—In 2 prospective cohorts, higher plasma dairy fatty acid concentrations were associated with lower incident 
diabetes mellitus. Results were similar for erythrocyte 17:0. Our findings highlight the need to better understand the 
potential health effects of dairy fat, and the dietary and metabolic determinants of these fatty acids.

such as pizzas, but also throughout the food supply in smaller 
amounts in mixed dishes, bakery products, and prepared 
foods. This may increase challenges of accurately capturing 
the intake of dairy fat from all sources. In comparison, cir-
culating blood biomarkers of fatty acids may provide a more 
complete measure of dairy fat consumption. These include 
specific fatty acids obtained primarily from dairy fat includ-
ing the odd-chain saturated fats pentadecanoic acid (15:0) and 
heptadecanoic acid (17:0)7,8 and the natural ruminant trans 
fat trans-palmitoleate (t-16:1n-7).9 These fatty acids are not 
endogenously synthesized and are obtained only from diet, 
particularly dairy, making them reasonable biomarkers of 
dairy fat consumption.10,11 In addition to their role as biomark-
ers, it has been hypothesized that these fatty acids could have 
direct metabolic effects, eg, t-16:1n-7 could mimic experi-
mentally observed effects of adipose-produced c-16:n-7 to 
increase muscle glucose uptake and suppress hepatic de novo 
lipogenesis.12 Yet, few prospective studies have investigated 
these biomarkers and incident diabetes mellitus, with mixed 
results (see Discussion).
Thus, the effects of dairy fat, and specific dairy fatty acids, 
on risk of diabetes mellitus remain unclear. Understanding 
these relationships is crucial for informing dietary guidelines, 
and designing additional interventional and experimental 
studies, as well, to explore biological pathways and mecha-
nisms. We tested the hypothesis that total plasma and eryth-
rocyte biomarkers of dairy fat, 15:0, 17:0, and t-16:1n-7, are 
associated with a lower incidence of diabetes mellitus in 2 
large prospective cohorts.
Methods
Study Design and Population
This investigation was derived from 2 large US prospective studies, 
the Nurses’ Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study 
(HPFS). Details of the cohorts and blood sample collection have been 
reported.13
We used previously measured fatty acid concentrations in stored 
blood used for nested case-control studies of incident CVD. Among 
Nurses’ Health Study and HPFS subjects who provided blood sam-
ples and were free of prevalent CVD or cancer at the time of blood 
sampling, we measured total plasma and erythrocyte fatty acid con-
centrations in 3499 men and women. Approximately 71% of partici-
pants were fasting at the time of blood collection. For present analysis 
focused on incident diabetes mellitus, participants with diabetes mel-
litus at the time of blood collection were excluded (n=166), leaving 
a total of 3333 participants for analysis. This included 1364 partici-
pants who developed CVD during follow-up and 1969 participants 
who did not develop CVD during follow-up. All analyses were first 
conducted in these 2 groups separately, and then combined after con-
firming that all associations were similar in magnitude and direction. 
This investigation was approved by the human subjects committees of 
all participating institutions, and all participants gave implied consent 
by providing blood samples and returning completed questionnaires.
Fatty Acids
In both cohorts, fatty acid concentrations were measured in stored 
total plasma and erythrocyte samples in the same laboratory using 
gas-liquid chromatography.13,14 Concentrations of individual circu-
lating fatty acids were expressed as a percentage of total fatty acids 
in plasma or erythrocyte membranes. Technicians and laboratory 
personnel were unaware of participant clinical information includ-
ing disease status. Forty fatty acids in plasma and erythrocytes were 
quantified (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement). For this 
investigation, primary biomarkers of interest were pentadecanoic 
acid (15:0), heptadecanoic acid (17:0), and trans-palmitoleic acid 
(t-16:1n-7). Myristic acid, a much less specific biomarker for dairy 
fat that is found in dairy, beef, and some plant oils15 and also endog-
enously synthesized by the liver (eg, in response to excess carbo-
hydrate intake), was secondarily analyzed. All the participants had 
levels of these 4 fatty acids above detectable limits.
Reproducibility of these fatty acids (intraclass correlation coeffi-
cients) in plasma and red blood cells over time has been reported.13,16 
Average interassay CVs for quality controls in plasma were 16.0% 
for 15:0, 7.2% for 17:0, 10.4% for t-16:1n-7, and 30.8% for 14:0. 
Corresponding CVs in erythrocyte measurements were 22.4%, 
11.3%, 14.2%, and 39.0%.
Incident Diabetes Mellitus
In both cohorts, participants were asked to report physician-diag-
nosed diabetes mellitus and the calendar year of diagnosis. To vali-
date self-reports, a supplementary questionnaire was sent obtaining 
further information on symptoms, diagnosis, and drug treatment. 
Suspected cases were labeled as confirmed if, according to the sup-
plementary questionnaire, they met ≥1 of 3 National Diabetes Data 
Group criteria: (1) classic symptoms plus fasting glucose ≥140 mg/
dL or random glucose ≥200 mg/dL; (2) at least 2 separate elevated 
plasma glucose levels (fasting ≥140, random ≥200, or 2-hour chal-
lenge ≥200 mg/dL); or (3) medical prescription of oral hypoglycemic 
agents or insulin. These diagnostic criteria were modified after June 
1996 to incorporate lower diagnostic cut offs for fasting glucose of 
126 mg/dL. Validity of supplementary questionnaire for diagnosing 
diabetes mellitus was confirmed in subsets of participants in each 
cohort by comparison with direct review of medical records: 98% 
were confirmed in Nurses’ Health Study, and 97% were confirmed 
in HPFS.17,18
Covariates and Other Risk Factors
Data on medical history, risk factors, and lifestyle were obtained 
in both cohorts via validated self-administered questionnaires 
(online-only Data Supplement). Usual alcohol use and dietary hab-
its were assessed through validated semiquantitative food frequency 
questionnaires.
Statistical Analysis
Fatty acid levels were evaluated in quartiles as indicator variables, 
continuously comparing the medians of the highest versus lowest 
quartile (87.5th versus 12.5th percentiles). Linear trend was assessed 
by assigning the median value of each quartile with participants and 
evaluating this as a continuous variable. Cox proportional hazards 
evaluated associations of each fatty acid with incident diabetes mel-
litus through 2010, with time at risk from blood collection until first 
event, death, or censoring at the return of the last questionnaire. 
Analyses were conducted separately in each cohort and then com-
bined using fixed-effects inverse-variance–weighted meta-analysis;19 
with pooled P-for-trend calculated by using generalized least-squares 
trend meta-analysis.20 Proportional hazards assumptions were tested 
by an interaction term with time and not rejected for any fatty acid, 
with the exception of 14:0 (P-interaction=0.01 in Nurses’ Health 
Study, 0.01 in HPFS). Visualization of Schoenfeld residuals for each 
fatty acid, including 14:0, did not suggest a nonzero slope, suggesting 
that any potential time interaction was small.
Multivariable models were used to minimize potential confound-
ing, with covariates included based on biological relevance, clinical 
interest, strength of associations with exposure or outcome, or per-
centage of change in the risk estimate of interest (>5%). For example, 
because dairy fat intake could be associated with other dietary hab-
its that may also influence diabetes mellitus, we adjusted for fruits, 
vegetables, fish, meats, whole grains, sugar-sweetened beverages, 
polyunsaturated fat, calcium, and glycemic load. We also adjusted 
for biomarker levels of trans-18:1 and trans-18:2, because dairy fat 
can contain ruminant trans fats; and for palmitic acid (16:0) and stea-
ric acid (18:0) synthesized by hepatic de novo lipogenesis, because

these fatty acids can alter relative circulating proportions of trace 
fatty acids and are linked to insulin resistance and diabetes melli-
tus in experimental and prospective studies.13,14,21 Dairy consump-
tion may causally influence body mass index (BMI) – eg, yogurt and 
cheese22,23 (the latter, if replacing refined carbohydrates) are linked 
to lower long-term weight gain and dairy intake reduces weight and 
fat mass in short-term trials24 – suggesting that BMI could partly 
mediate any associations between dairy intake and diabetes mellitus. 
Individuals with different BMIs may also select different dairy foods, 
which could confound associations. We therefore separately consid-
ered BMI as a potential mediator and confounder in an additional 
multivariable model.
We explored effect modification by age and BMI by using the Wald 
test for a multiplicative interaction term, with Bonferroni-corrected sig-
nificance (4 fatty acids × 2 effect modifiers: α=0.05/8=0.006). To mini-
mize misclassification attributable to exposure changes over time, we 
performed sensitivity analyses restricted to the first 8 years of follow-
up. To minimize reverse causation attributable to unrecognized subclin-
ical disease or presence of clinical risk factors at the time of fatty acid 
measurement, we also excluded cases occurring during the first 2 years. 
We evaluated self-reported yogurt, cheese, and dairy fat consumption 
as additional covariates to assess if the associations were indepen-
dent of these dietary factors outside their specific fatty acid contents. 
Multiple (10-fold) imputation was performed for missing continuous, 
and indicator variables for missing categorical covariates. Nonlinear 
relationships were assessed by semiparametric restricted cubic splines, 
excluding participants with fatty acid levels <0.5th or >99.5th percen-
tiles to minimize the influence of outliers. Analyses were conducted 
using SAS 9.3 (Cary, NC), 2-tailed α=0.05.
Results
At baseline, mean±standard deviation age was 64.6±8.6 years 
among men (range, 48–83 years) and 60.4±6.3 years among 
women (range, 44–70 years; Table 1, Table II in the online-
only Data Supplement). About half of participants were over-
weight or obese; 1 in 4 had hypertension or a family history 
of diabetes mellitus; 1 in 3 had hypercholesterolemia; and 1 in 
12 men and 1 in 5 women were current smokers. Average total 
dairy consumption was 2.1 servings/d, with similar contribu-
tions from whole-fat (≈45%) and low-fat (≈55%) products.
Within each circulating lipid compartment (plasma, 
erythrocyte), the different fatty acid biomarkers were mod-
estly intercorrelated: in plasma, adjusted intercorrelations (r) 
ranged from 0.10 to 0.59 (Table III in the online-only Data 
Supplement); and in erythrocytes, from 0.47 to 0.69 (Table IV 
in the online-only Data Supplement). As expected for these 
different lipid compartments, correlations between plasma 
and erythrocyte fatty acid biomarkers were moderate: 0.32

for 15:0, 0.44 for 17:0, 0.42 for t-16:1n-7, and 0.24 for 14:0. 
Partial correlations with self-reported dairy fat consumption 
were modest for plasma 15:0 (r=0.29), 17:0 (r=0.21), and 
t-16:1n-7 (r=0.22); and weaker for 14:0 (r=0.11; Table III and 
Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement); and similar but 
somewhat lower for erythrocyte fatty acids (Table IV in the 
online-only Data Supplement). These correlations were simi-
lar among participants who were fasting at the time of blood 
collection (data not shown).
Plasma Fatty Acid Biomarkers and Risk of Diabetes 
Mellitus
During mean±standard deviation follow-up of 15.2±5.6 years, 
277 new cases of diabetes mellitus were diagnosed. After 
adjustment for demographics, metabolic risk factors, lifestyle, 
dietary habits, and other circulating fatty acids, in comparison 
with the lowest quartile, individuals in the highest quartile of 
plasma 15:0 had 44% lower risk of diabetes mellitus (hazard 
ratio [HR],0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37–0.86; 
P-trend=0.01); of plasma 17:0, 43% lower risk (HR, 0.57; 
95% CI, 0.39–0.83; P-trend<0.01); and of t-16:1n-7, 52% 
lower risk (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.33–0.70; P-trend <0.001; 
Table 2). Findings were generally similar in magnitude and 
direction in the 2 separate cohorts, without statistically sig-
nificant effect modification by sex. 14:0 was not significantly 
associated with diabetes mellitus (P-trend=0.36).
Evaluated continuously, 15:0 was associated with 38% 
lower risk (pooled HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.46–0.85); 17:0, with 
32% lower risk (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.50–0.91); and t-16:1n-7, 
with 46% lower risk (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.40–0.73; Table 3). 
Similar to categorical analyses, plasma 14:0 was not associ-
ated with diabetes risk (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.60–1.11).
Because BMI is a major predictor of insulin resistance and 
diabetes mellitus, we conducted further multivariable-adjusted 
analyses to evaluate the potential independent associations 
between BMI and dairy fatty acid biomarker levels at baseline. 
In both cohorts combined, higher 15:0 was not associated with 
BMI (Q1 versus Q4: 25.3 versus 25.3 kg/m2, P-trend=0.97; 
Table II in the online-only Data Supplement). Higher 17:0 
(25.8 versus 25.0, P-trend<0.001) and t-16:1n-7 (25.9 ver-
sus 25.2, P-trend<0.001) were associated with lower BMI, 
although absolute differences were modest. 14:0 was associ-
ated with higher BMI (24.9 versus 25.9, P-trend<0.001). After 
further adjustment for baseline BMI as a potential mediator 
or confounder, associations with incident diabetes mellitus 
were slightly attenuated for 17:0 and not appreciably altered 
for other fatty acids (Table 3). Results were also similar after 
further multivariable adjustment for conjugated linoleic acid, 
another ruminant-derived fatty acid (data not shown).
We further examined the potential influence of each indi-
vidual covariate in the model. Adjustment for fatty acid bio-
markers of de novo lipogenesis, 16:0 and 18:0,25,26 had the 
greatest effect on plasma 15:0, which was no longer signifi-
cantly associated with diabetes mellitus when 16:0 and 18:0 
were removed as covariates (continuous HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 
0.85–1.42). Conversely, removal of these fatty acid covariates 
had smaller influence on associations with diabetes mellitus 
for plasma 17:0 (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51–0.89) or t-16:1n-7 
(HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.51–0.92).
With simultaneous mutual adjustment for all 3 dairy fat 
biomarkers, associations were nonsignificant for plasma 15:0 
(continuous HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.53–1.29) and 17:0 (HR, 
0.93; 95% CI, 0.64–1.36), and unchanged for t-16:1n-7 (HR, 
0.59; 95% CI, 0.43–0.80).
Semiparametric Analyses
Restricted cubic splines demonstrated an inverse linear rela-
tionship for plasma 15:0, 17:0, and t-16:1n-7 and incident dia-
betes mellitus (Figure). Plasma 14:0 was not associated with 
risk (P-linearity=0.48).
Erythrocyte Fatty Acid Biomarkers
When we evaluated erythrocyte fatty acids, a lower incidence 
of diabetes mellitus was seen with higher levels of 17:0 (HR, 
0.54; 95% CI, 0.34–0.87; P-trend <0.001), and t-16:1n-7 (HR, 
0.78; 95% CI, 0.51–1.18; P-trend=0.05; Table V in the online-
only Data Supplement). Erythrocyte 15:0 was not signifi-
cantly associated with incident diabetes (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 
0.55–1.25; P-trend=0.63), and erythrocyte 14:0 was associ-
ated with a nonsignificant trend toward higher risk (HR, 1.56; 
95% CI, 0.98–2.49; P-trend=0.13). The latter association was 
driven by findings in HPFS.
When these erythrocyte fatty acids were evaluated contin-
uously, similar findings were seen for 15:0 and 17:0; t-16:1n-7 
was no longer associated with lower risk (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 
0.57–1.13); and 14:0 was associated with 36% higher risk 
(HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.11–1.67; Table VI in the online-only 
Data Supplement). As with the categorical analyses, the lat-
ter association was driven by findings in HPFS only (data not 
shown). As seen with plasma 17:0, further adjustment for BMI 
as a mediator or confounder partly attenuated the observed 
inverse association for erythrocyte 17:0. Among other fatty 
acid covariates in the multivariable model, removal of adjust-
ment for fatty acid biomarkers of de novo lipogenesis had 
little effect on these risk estimates (data not shown).
Sensitivity Analyses
When we evaluated potential effect modification, the associations 
of plasma and erythrocyte fatty acids with incident diabetes mel-
litus did not significantly vary according to differences in age or 
BMI (P>Bonferroni-corrected α=0.006 each). Associations were 
also similar after further adjustment for self-reported consump-
tion of yogurt, cheese, or dairy fat (Table VII in the online-only 
Data Supplement). For example, in comparison with the associa-
tion of plasma t-16:1n-7 with diabetes mellitus in the main model 
(continuous HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.40–0.73), findings were not 
appreciably altered by additional adjustment for reported con-

0.53; 95% CI, 0.40–0.71), or dairy fat (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.38–

occurring within the first 2 years and restricting to the first 8 years 
of follow-up (Table VIII in the online-only Data Supplement).
Discussion
In 2 separate cohorts of US men and women, 3 plasma bio-
markers of dairy fat, 15:0, 17:0, and trans-16:1n-7, were asso-
ciated with lower risk of incident diabetes mellitus. Findings 
were generally similar for erythrocyte fatty acids, although with

smaller and not always significant magnitudes of association. 
These results provide new evidence on associations of dairy-
derived circulating fatty acids and risk of diabetes mellitus.
Our findings suggest that either these dairy fatty acids 
themselves or other correlated factors in dairy fat could 
reduce the risk of diabetes mellitus. For instance, short- and 
medium-chain saturated fats, vitamin D (a fat-soluble vita-
min), omega-3 fats, or gangliosides in dairy fat could each 
play a role.27 The magnitudes of our associations, linear dose 
response, independence from established diabetes risk factors 
and other dietary habits, and consistency of findings across 
sensitivity analyses argue against residual confounding as the 
sole explanation for our findings. These results highlight the 
need for intensive experimental and mechanistic evaluation on 
health effects of dairy fat, and dietary and potential metabolic 
determinants of these circulating fatty acids, as well, includ-
ing their sensitivity to indicators of de novo lipogenesis.
In observational analyses, self-reported consumption of 
high-fat dairy foods such as cheese have beneficial or neutral 
associations with diabetes mellitus,4–6 whereas dairy fat con-
sumption and dairy fat biomarkers correlate with improved 
hepatic and systemic insulin sensitivity and lower hepatic 
steatosis.28,29 When we included all 3 plasma fatty acids in 1 
model, only t-16:1n-7 retained independent significant asso-
ciation with diabetes mellitus. We have hypothesized12 that 
benefits could be attributable to isomeric similarities between

t-16:1n-7, a natural ruminant trans fat, and cis-16:1n-7 that, 
when derived from adipose tissue through de novo lipogen-
esis, may act in feedback loops to reduce hepatic fat synthesis 
and increase muscle insulin sensitivity.30,31 We wonder whether 
t-16:1n-7, consumed in the diet, might have similar effects.
Fatty acids 15:0, 17:0, and t-16:1n-7 are predominantly 
obtained from diet and not synthesized, making reverse 
causation because of abnormal metabolism at baseline 
unlikely. One small study (n=12) found that providing a mixed 
oil high in trans-18:1 (vaccenic acid) also increased serum 
t-16:1n-7, whereas human peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
cultured with t-18:1 incorporated small amounts of t-16:1n-7 
into cellular lipids.32 These findings suggest small amounts of 
t-16:1n-7 could derive from partial β-oxidation (endogenous

chain shortening) of t-18:1; labeled fatty acid tracer studies 
are needed to confirm this result. In the present study, among 
all dietary factors, circulating t-16:1n-7 correlated most with 
dairy fat rather than sources of industrial trans fat (vacce-
nic acid), suggesting that direct dairy consumption remains 
a major source. Genome-wide association studies have not 
identified significant genetic determinants of circulating 
t-16:1n-7,33 further suggesting the absence of strong endog-
enous influences. Body weight and insulin resistance produce 
no known effects on levels of these circulating fatty acids, and 
findings were generally similar following adjustment for BMI. 
Reverse causation could play a role in behaviors, for example, 
if higher-risk participants with subclinical prediabetes elected 
to avoid whole-fat dairy products. Yet, the prospective nature 
of our analysis minimizes this possibility; and 15:0, 17:0, and 
t-16:1n-7 also remained inversely associated with diabetes 
mellitus after excluding cases occurring in the first 2 years.
In these cohorts, plasma fatty acid biomarkers correlated 
more strongly with dairy fat intake than did erythrocyte bio-
markers, and were also more strongly inversely associated 
with diabetes mellitus. Correlations of all these fatty acids 
with self-reported dairy consumption were modest. This may 
be attributable to random or systematic errors in self-reported 
diet, variability of these fatty acids in different dairy foods,34 
laboratory error in fatty acid measures, within-person variation 
in diet or circulating fatty acids, or other unknown influences 
on bioavailability, metabolism, or incorporation into specific 
lipid compartments of these fatty acids. Notably, dairy fat is 
consumed not just as whole foods (milk, cheese, yogurt, but-
ter) but mixed into numerous foods, dishes, and recipes as 
major and minor ingredients. In our analysis of National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data based on 
detailed, product-specific dietary recalls (2005–2012), 51% of 
cheese and 30% of total dairy is consumed in mixed dishes, 
especially grain products but also mixed with meats, sweets, 
vegetables, and eggs (data not shown). Food frequency ques-
tionnaires that estimate dairy fat intakes from whole foods and 
major mixed sources (eg, pasta dishes, burritos, pizza) may 
not accurately capture quantities in these mixed dishes nor the 
multitude of smaller amounts in many other products. Thus, the 
observed modest correlations of 15:0, 17:0, and t-16:1n-7 with 
self-reported dairy fat may appropriately reflect the challenges 
in fully estimating dairy fat from questionnaires.
Fatty acid 14:0 had weak correlations with self-reported 
intakes of dairy fat, meat, and carbohydrate-rich foods (the lat-
ter being drivers of endogenous hepatic fatty acid synthesis). 
Plasma 14:0 was unassociated with diabetes risk; erythrocyte 
14:0 was associated with increased risk in 1 cohort. Higher 
laboratory imprecision in 14:0 measures could limit the abil-
ity to detect associations. Trend toward higher risk could also 
relate to derivation of 14:0 from endogenous de novo lipogen-
esis, a correlate of insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus.21 
This could also be a chance finding and should be interpreted 
with caution. Recent analysis in the European Prospective 
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study identi-
fied a positive association between plasma phospholipid 14:0 
and incident diabetes mellitus.21 Our findings support the need 
for further studies on 14:0, especially on endogenous meta-
bolic determinants of its circulating levels.
In pooled analyses of observational studies, self-reported 
intakes of total dairy, low-fat dairy, whole-fat dairy, milk, and 
cheese have each shown mixed (beneficial or neutral) asso-
ciations with diabetes mellitus; yogurt consumption is more 
consistently associated with lower risk.4–6 Interestingly, none 
of these studies identified harms of dairy, including whole-
fat dairy, for diabetes mellitus. A handful of prior prospective 
studies have evaluated circulating biomarkers of dairy fat con-
sumption in relation to incident diabetes mellitus (Table 4).

Only 2 studies12,35 reported on t-16:1n-7; both found sub-
stantially lower risk, consistent with our findings. Three of 5 
previous studies evaluating 15:0 and 2 of 3 studies evaluating 
17:0 observed significant inverse associations with diabetes 
mellitus; none observed higher risk. In the present analysis, 
t-16:1n-7 remained associated with diabetes mellitus after 
adjustment for the other dairy fat biomarkers, suggesting it 
may be particularly relevant for further investigation of its 
determinants and biological effects. Our findings build on 
and extend previous studies by evaluating these fatty acid bio-
markers, including t-16:1n-7, in total plasma and erythrocytes 
in 2 large, well-established cohorts of US men and women 
and including adjustment for a range of potential confounding 
factors.
Our investigation has several strengths. We assessed cir-
culating fatty acids, which may more fully capture all dietary 
sources of dairy fat. We evaluated 2 separate lipid compart-
ments, in which generally similar associations support validity 
of the findings, especially in light of their potential differen-
tial temporal and metabolic responses to dietary fats intake. 
The prospective cohort design minimized reverse causation, 
selection bias, and recall bias. Inclusion of 2 separate cohorts 
including both men and women provided for replication, and 
pooling, as well, of cohort findings.
Potential limitations should be considered. Misclassification 
because of laboratory error and within-person changes over 
time would attenuate results, making it more difficult to detect 
true associations. Despite this, we were able to detect asso-
ciations with diabetes mellitus, suggesting true relationships 
could be even stronger. Residual confounding attributable to 
unmeasured or mismeasured covariates cannot be excluded. 
However, magnitudes of associations and linear dose responses 
suggest that residual confounding is unlikely to fully explain 
the results. These cohorts comprised educated US health pro-
fessionals. Yet, although absolute levels of fatty acids and 
rates of diabetes mellitus may vary by education, geography, 
or race/ethnicity, we do not suspect that biological effects of 
these fatty acids should differ on a relative scale across differ-
ent populations.
In summary, we found that plasma 15:0, 17:0, and trans-
16:1n-7 were associated with a lower incidence of diabetes 
mellitus in 2 separate prospective cohort studies.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
Diabetes mellitus is a major preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. Growing evidence suggests that dairy foods, 
and even dairy fat, could reduce risk of diabetes mellitus. Most previous studies used self-reported dietary questionnaires 
that could be prone to subjective reporting and might not fully capture dairy fat intake, particularly from mixed dishes. 
Circulating fatty acid biomarkers, such as odd-chain saturated fats (15:0, 17:0) and certain natural trans fats (t-16:1n-7), 
may provide more objective measures of dairy fat intake. We prospectively evaluated the relationship between plasma con-
centrations of 15:0, 17:0, and t-16:1n-7 and new-onset diabetes mellitus among 3333 men and women aged 30 to 75 years 
in 2 separate US cohorts. Incident diabetes mellitus was confirmed by validated methods based on symptoms, diagnostic 
tests, and medical therapy. After adjusting for demographics, metabolic risk factors, lifestyle, diet, and other circulating fatty 
acids, we found that all 3 of these circulating fatty acids were associated with substantially lower risk of diabetes mellitus, 
with ≈45% to 50% lower risk comparing the top versus bottom quartiles of their levels. Potential limitations include the 
misclassification of fatty acid measurements because of laboratory error and within-person variation over time, which would 
attenuate results toward the null; and residual confounding because of unmeasured or mismeasured covariates, although this 
would seem unlikely to fully explain the magnitudes of observed associations. Our findings suggest that dairy foods, and 
specifically dairy fat, could help prevent diabetes mellitus, highlighting the need for intensive experimental and mechanistic 
evaluation on the health effects of dairy fat, and as the determinants of these circulating fatty acids, as well.
