T
he treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME) has become one of the most challenging management issues faced by ophthalmologists in 
daily practice. This is partly due to the multifactorial nature of DME, progression of the disease and the clinical capacity needed to administer 
intravitreal injections. In recent years, the treatment options for DME have expanded to include intravitreal injections of anti-vascular 
endothelial growth factor  (VEGF) agents and steroids, and most recently, the use of intravitreal implants. In determining clinically relevant endpoints 
for clinical studies of these treatments, it is important to consider the patient’s journey and experience with a treatment over a specific time-period 
rather than isolated outcomes at a pre-specified time-point. Area under the curve (AUC) is an ideal tool for data analysis particularly when it comes 
to sustained release therapies such as dexamethasone (Ozurdex®, Allergan Inc., California, US) and intravitreal fluocinolone acetonide implant 
(0.2µg/day FAc implant; Iluvien®, Alimera Sciences Inc., Georgia, US). Unlike single time-point outcomes, AUC analysis provides the average letters 
gained per day over the entire treatment period, providing a better measure of long-term effectiveness. A recent analysis using the AUC approach 
highlights the significant visual acuity benefit resulting from the 0.2µg/day fluocinolone acetonide (FAc) implant during the FAME (Fluocinolone 
Acetonide for Macular Edema) trials. A step-by-step instruction is included in this article that allows statistical analysis of the AUC data from both 
functional and anatomical outcomes, using a free software tool to further facilitate the use of this technique for future investigators.

Vascular exposure to hyperglycemia over extended periods, destroys 
the retinal endothelial cell tight junctions and leads to the development 
of macular edema with consequent visual loss.1 Indeed, diabetic macular 
edema (DME) is the most common cause of visual impairment in diabetic 
patients.2 At the same time, considering that the incidence of diabetes is on 
the rise, it becomes prudent to effectively address DME. According to the 
World Health Organization (WHO) study, the global incidence of diabetes 
has risen from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014 and attributes to 
2.6% of global blindness.3 These estimates are expected to rise further due 
to the increasing prevalence of diabetes, ageing of the population and the 
increasing life expectancy of those with diabetes.
Until recently, the standard of care for DME was laser photocoagulation, 
which slows progression of vision loss but rarely results in improvement of 
vision, even after 3 years of treatment. According to the Early Treatment of 
Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), laser treatment of clinically significant 
macular edema (CSME) decreases the risk of moderate vision impairment 
(15 letters) by half over 3 years.4 Nonetheless, the introduction of intravitreal 
pharmacologic agents, namely the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF) agents and corticosteroids, has changed the prognosis of DME from 
stabilization of vision to improvement. 
Pathogenesis and treatment 
The pathogenesis of DME is attributed to the destruction of endothelial cell 
tight junctions but more specifically, it is thought that, as a consequence of 
non-perfusion and hypoxia in diabetic retinopathy, production of VEGF and 
other inflammatory cytokines attributes to the distortion of vascular barriers.

Area Under the Curve Analysis as an Outcome Measure in Accessing a Fluocinolone Acetonide Implant (ILUVIEN®)
The endothelial cells and their tight junctions act as a barrier to maintain 
the water and protein balance between the intravascular and extravascular 
compartments. Nevertheless, VEGF and other inflammatory cytokines 
disrupt this barrier function by altering the structure of the cytoskeleton 
and/or by affecting the expression of adhesive proteins at endothelial 
junctions.5–7 Therefore, not surprisingly, DME treatments target the direct 
intravitreal injection of steroids and anti-VEGF agents. Current intravitreal 
treatments include short acting options such as intravitreal triamcinolone,8 
Ozurdex(R) (Allergan Inc., Irvine, CA, US), a dexamethasone implant,9 anti-
VEGF agents including ranibizumab,12–14 bevacizumab,15 pegaptanib,16 and 
aflibercept,17 and longer-acting options such as Iluvien (Alimera Sciences 
Inc., Alpharetta, GA, US) which releases 0.2 μg/day fluocinolone acetonide 
(FAc) for 36 months.10,11
Bevacizumab
Bevacizumab (Avastin®, Genentech,  San Francisco, CA, US) is a full-length 
humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to all the isoforms of VEGF
.18,19 
According to the BOLT (Bevacizumab Or Laser Therapy) trial, in patients with 
CSME and treated with bevacizumab, mean best corrected visual acuity 
(BCVA) was significantly higher (64.4±13.3; mean ± standard deviation [SD] 
ETDRS letters) than patients treated with laser (54.8±12.6 ETDRS letters). 
This study showed that the bevacizumab arm gained a median of 9 ETDRS 
letters in comparison to 2.5 letters in laser treatment group (p=0.005).15 
Additionally, the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research (DRCR) study 
reveals a more robust reduction of central subfield thickness (CST) in the 
bevacizumab arm compared to the laser arm.20
Ranibizumab
Ranibizumab (Lucentis®, Genentech, San Francisco, CA, US) is a humanized, 
affinity-matured, monoclonal antibody Fab fragment that binds to all 
isoforms of human VEGF-A.18 Unlike the full-length antibodies (e.g., 
bevacizumab), ranibizumab’s lack of the Fc region makes the medication 
more permeable to retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layers and thus, 
theoretically, ranibizumab is more effective than bevacizumab in reaching 
the choroidal neovascularization beneath the RPE layer.21 Nevertheless, 
considering these structural differences, the half-life of ranibizumab is 
markedly shorter than bevacizumab and the medication clears more 
quickly from systemic circulation following an intravitreal injection with 
half-lives of 2 hours and 20 days, respectively.22–25 
The READ-2 study (Ranibizumab for Edema of the mAcula in Diabetes) was 
a pioneering work that demonstrated a significantly better BCVA outcome 
for DME patients following ranibizumab (0.5 mg) injection compared 
to laser treatment: A BCVA gain of 7.24 letters in the ranibizumab arm 
compared to a loss of 0.43 letters in the laser arm at month 6.26 Later 
studies continued to support the effectiveness of ranibizumab in treatment 
of DME as well as its superiority over laser treatment. According to the 
RESTORE study, in comparison to laser treatment alone, ranibizumab (0.5 
mg) monotherapy over a 12 months period results in a significantly greater 
proportion of DME patients with a BCVA letter score ≥15.14 The RESOLVE 
study also shows that, in comparison to sham and after a 12-month 
period, three monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab (0.3 or 0.5 mg) 
significantly improved the BCVA from baseline by 10.3±9.1 letters. Also, in 
the ranibizumab group, there was a significant reduction in central retinal 
thickness (194.2±135.1 μm) compared to the sham group (48.4±153.4 μm).13 
RIDE and RISE are identical phase III studies that compared the efficacy 
and safety of sham and ranibizumab injections in patients with DME. In 
RIDE the proportion of patients gaining ≥15 ETDRS letters in BCVA from 
baseline at month 24, were as follows: 19.2% (sham or cross over to 0.5 
mg), 36.8% (0.3 mg), and 40.2% (0.5 mg). On the same note, the RIDE 
study shows a 22.0% (sham/0.5 mg), 51.2% (0.3 mg), and 41.6% (0.5 mg) 
improvements in BCVA.12 
Pegaptanib
Pegaptanib (Macugen®, Gilead Sciences Inc., San Dimas, CA, US) is 
another anti-angiogenic antibody that specifically binds and blocks the 
activity of extracellular VEGF-A165 isoform, which is the most potent and 
abundant form of VEGF
.27 This treatment is administered as monthly or 
bimonthly intravitreous injections. The combined analysis of multiple trials 
demonstrated a lower loss of visual acuity at 12 months in patients treated 
with pegaptanib (0.3 mg: 70% of patients; 1.0 mg: 71% of patients; 3.0 mg: 
65% of patients) treatment compared to the sham injection group (55%).28
Aflibercept
Aflibercept (Eylea®, Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Tarrytown, NY, US) is a 
recombinant fusion protein that contains portions of human VEGF receptor 
fused to the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G (IgG)1 antibody.29 The 
DA VINCI study demonstrates that aflibercept injection is more effective 
than the laser at improving BCVA as well as CST at week 52: aflibercept 
arm with BCVA gain of 9.7 to 12 letters and CST reduction of 165.4 to 
 
227.4 μm compared to laser arm with BCVA loss of 1.3 and CST reduction 
of 58.4 μm.17 Likewise, results of two parallel studies, VIVID and VISTA, 
depict superiority of aflibercept arm a gain in visual acuity compared to 
the laser arm in patients with DME. letters for ranibizumab.. The mean 
BCVA gain from baseline to week 148  following treatment with aflibercept 
or laser was 10.4–10.5 and 1.4 letters in VISTA and 10.3–11.7 and 1.6 letters 
in VIVID, respectively.30 Finally, the DRCR study shows that at 2 years, mean 
visual acuity improvement are 12.8 letters for aflibercept, 10.0 letters for 
bevacizumab and 12.3 for ranibizumab.31 
Triamcinolone
Inflammation is an important mechanism of DME development and thus, 
when anti-VEGF agents yield suboptimal results or systemic vascular 
disorders limit their use, or clinical capacity is limited, steroids become 
the mainstay of treatment. Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide has been 
shown to effectively reduce macular edema in the short term13 but is 
limited by a short duration of action and the need for repeated injections 
and visits. In addition, intraocular pressure (IOP) rises of >10 mm Hg (18% 
for 1 mg; 33% for 4 mg) as well as an increased need for cataract surgery 
(46% for 1 mg; 83% for 4 mg) are adverse reactions that discourage most 
clinicians from using triamcinolone as a preferred agent for first-line 
treatment of DME.32
Dexamethasone implant
The dexamethasone intravitreal implant (0.7 mg), also known as 
Dexamethasone Posterior Segment Drug Delivery System (Ozurdex), 
consists of micronized dexamethasone in a biodegradable copolymer 
of polylactic-co-glycolic acid which releases dexamethasone into the 
vitreous over a period up to 6 months as shown in male monkey studies.33 
The implant is inserted into the vitreous with a 22-gauge needle,34 with the 
goal of reducing the frequency of intravitreal injections. Multiple studies 
show that the dexamethasone intravitreal implant is an effective means 
of improving BCVA and reducing macular edema in patients with DME.35–37 
The adverse reactions of the dexamethasone implant include the need

for IOP lowering medications to manage ocular hypertension (41.5% for 
dexamethasone versus 9.1% for sham) and cataract progression (67.9% 
 
for dexamethasone versus 20.4% for sham).38 
Fluocinolone acetonide implant
Recently, a new generation of a non-biodegradable, long term intravitreal 
implant, 0.2 µg/day FAc, has become available. The implant is inserted 
into the vitreous with a 25-gauge needle. The implant contains 0.19 mg of 
FAc and releases the drug at a rate of 0.2 µg of FAc per day over a period 
of 36 months.10,39 This formulation potentially means fewer injections, 
visits and improved management of patients.40
The next section focuses on the use of area under the curve (AUC) 
as an effective means of assessing the efficacy of sustained-release 
medications, most notably the longer-acting steroids, dexamethasone 
and fluocinolone.
Area under the curve
AUC is a useful approach for integrating serial assessments of a patient's 
outcome over the duration of a study.41 While area AUC is a fundamental 
concept in pharmacokinetics, until recently, its use in clinical trials has been 
largely neglected and only used in a few therapeutic areas.41,42 
The recent DRCR.net Protocol S study used AUC for assessment of vision 
outcome in DME treatments for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). In 
this trial, the efficacy and safety of intravitreous ranibizumab were compared 
with panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) in patients with proliferative 
diabetic retinopathy.43 The investigators set the primary outcome as mean 
visual acuity change at 2 years and the secondary outcome as visual acuity 
AUC to provide an assessment of vision throughout follow-up. The result 
of the study show +4.2 difference in AUC visual acuity over two years in 
the ranibizumab group versus PRP group (95% CI, +3.0 to +5.4; p<0.001). 
By contrast, the difference in the primary endpoint of mean visual acuity 
letter improvement at two years was not statistically significant (+2.2; 
95% confidence interval [CI], -0.5 to +5.0). These outcomes highlight the 
importance of AUC analysis in clinical trials, reminding clinicians that AUC 
can potentially provide a better assessment of the visual acuity gain over 
the course of a DME trial by indicating the average effect of treatment 
over time. Likewise, post hoc analyses from the DRCR Network have been 
performed to assess the change in visual acuity AUC for comparison of 
aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab in the treatment of DME. Results 
of the study show that eyes with a visual acuity of 20/50 or worse have the 
greatest improvement over 2 years with aflibercept treatment.44
The AUC calculations have also been used in the VISION trial to assess the 
effectiveness of pegaptanib in the treatment of neovascular age-related 
macular degeneration. According to this study, the proportions of patients 
experiencing a loss of ≥15 letters from week 54 to week 102 was half 
as many in the treatment group as compared with those patients who 
discontinued pegaptanib.16
In particular, considering the gradual decrease in the vitreous 
concentration of sustained-release medications, the AUC analysis is 
highly recommended for evaluating the continuous effects of these 
medications. Indeed, in a pair of 3-year, phase III randomized, sham-
controlled trials, the efficacy of dexamethasone implants (0.35 mg and 
0.7 mg) in DME patients has been evaluated using the AUC method.45,46 
The results of these trials have been presented in the European public 
assessment evaluation of dexamethasone implant (Table 1).47 The AUC 
was the primary efficacy measure. In one of these studies (206207-
010, n=494), the average number of BCVA letters gained per day (AUC 
approach) was significantly greater with dexamethasone implant 700 
compared with sham (difference of 2.1, 95% CI: 0.4–3.8, p=0.016) and 
with dexamethasone implant 350 compared to sham (difference of 2.3, 
95% CI: 0.5–4.0, p=0.010).47 In the other study (206207-011, n=554) the 
mean BCVA change from baseline was 2.9 with dexamethasone implant 
700 compared to 2.0 with Sham (difference of 0.8 letters, 95% CI: -0.9–2.4, 
p=0.366). The AUC was 2.9 with dexamethasone implant 350 compared 
with 2.0 with sham (difference of 0.7, 95% CI: -0.9–2.4, p=0.396). The 
differences were not statistically significant indicating that one of the two 
trials failed its primary endpoint.
These studies demonstrate how the AUC method is regaining popularity, 
particularly in the context of longer-acting medications. In the MEAD study, 
the statistically significant difference disappears in terms of BCVA of the 
total group of dexamethasone implants versus sham group at around month 
18 to month 36 months post-initiation of the study (this is presumably due 
to cataract formation).46 Although the BCVA of 0.7 mg implants once again 
significantly improved from the sham arm at 36–39 months of treatment, 
this example shows how endpoint mean measurements based on the 
single time point of final BCVA may be misleading. 
The PLACID study is another relevant trial comparing DEX (0.7 mg) combined 
with laser photocoagulation to laser alone for the treatment of DME.48 While 
there was no statistical difference between the treatment groups at month 
12, AUC analysis of BCVA depicts a significantly greater improvement in 
BCVA of the combined treatment group.

Area Under the Curve Analysis as an Outcome Measure in Accessing a Fluocinolone Acetonide Implant (ILUVIEN®)
The most feasible explanation for BCVA decline with the dexamethasone 
implant is due to a gradual decrease in the vitreous concentration of 
steroids49 and consequent dilution of final outcome measurements towards 
the end of the trial. Cataract formation could be argued as a source of the 
decline in terms of vision, but retinal thickness also declines, showing that it 
is a drug-related effect. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the overall trend 
of BCVA improvement in studies using sustained-released medications to 
determine the efficacy of the treatment. 
It is worth noting that AUC analysis only interprets the overall statistical 
significance of a treatment rather than specific time points during the 
period of study. Hence, this form of analysis may not be suitable for studies 
that are interested in evaluating early effects rather than long term overall 
effects, in that early effect of a treatment could be diluted by long term data 
and lose its statistical significance. Therefore, for these situations, linear 
or generalized mixed models may be used as an alternative approach to 
flexible analysis of correlated data.
The 0.2 µg/day fluocinolone acetonide implant and 
diabetic macular edema
Considering that the 0.2 µg/day FAc implant is a new generation of 
sustained-release steroid implant, most of what we know from the effects 
of this medication comes from European studies, in that, the launch of the 
0.2 µg/day FAc implant in Europe preceded that in the US by 2 years. Here 
follows a summary of the 0.2 µg/day FAc implant studies. 
Safety and efficacy of the 0.2 µg/day FAc implant in DME patients has 
been tested in the FAME trials which included two phase III randomized 
trials (FAME A and FAME B) comparing 0.5- and 0.2-µg/day implants to 
sham injection groups.39 Combined results of these two studies showed 
the mean improvement in BCVA letter score from baseline to month 24 
was 4.4 and 5.4 for the 0.5- and 0.2-µg/day doses, respectively, compared 
with 1.7 in the sham group (p=0.02 and p=0.016, respectively). At month 
36, improvement from baseline in the percentage of patients with a ≥15 
ETDRS letter gain continued to be statistically significant for 0.2 µg/day 
FAc (28.7%) and 0.5 µg/day FAc (28.6 %) implants compared with the sham 
group (16.2%, p=0.002 for each). However, phakic patients requiring cataract 
surgery were more frequent for implant arms (74.9% for 0.2 µg/day FAc and 
84.5%, for 0.5 µg/day) compared with the sham group (23.1%, although the 
cataract formation was higher means that not every patient underwent 
surgery during the study). Similarly, ocular hypertension-requiring incisional 
 
surgery was needed in 3.7%, 7.6%, and 0.5% of the 0.2 µg/day, 0.5 µg/day, 
and sham groups, respectively.10 
Data regarding AUC in the FAME trials was recently presented based 
on the BCVA letter gain for the 0.2 µg/day FAc implant sham (Figure 1). 
 
These come from an integrated analysis of the FAME A and FAME B 
trials showing that at 36 months there was a significant difference in 
AUC between subjects who received 0.2 µg/day FAc implants and sham 
control injections (5.2 versus 1.6 letters p<0.001, Figure 1).50 This benefit 
was seen in both the FAME A (4.5 versus 2.3 letters, p=0.031) and FAME 
B (5.8 versus 0.9 letters, p<0.001) trials. For subgroup analysis, subjects 
with a longer DME duration showed greater BCVA benefit (6.9 versus 1.9, 
for 0.2 μg/day FAc implant versus sham, p<0.001) compared with those 
with a shorter duration of DME (2.9 versus 1.4, p=0.03).51 In addition, 
subjects who were pseudophakic at baseline showed greater benefits 
(7.1 versus 1.7, p<0.001) than patients who were phakic at baseline (4.7 
versus 1.8, p=0.115).52 An AUC analysis of the longer DME duration arm in 
the FAME trials showed numerically similar vision outcomes irrespective 
of lens status over 36 months (7.8 versus 2.2, p=0.004 for those who 
were pseudophakic at baseline ns 7.4 versus 2.1, p=0.020 for those 
 
who were phakic at baseline and became pseudophakic).53
AUC analysis indicates that the 0.2 µg/day FAc implant produced 
significant benefits compared with sham control. The changes in DME were 
consistently seen in both the FAME A and FAME B trials and were greater 
(p=0.029) than those observed with other sustained release steroids such 
as dexamethasone implant 700 but were achieved with fewer injections 
(1.3 in FAME versus 4.1 in MEAD). This analysis demonstrated that the 
AUC method captures treatment benefit over the entire dosing period 
which is particularly appropriate for studies of extended duration.
Besides the FAME trials, another recent study tested the effects of 
fluocinolone intravitreal implant in DME patients that were resistant to 
laser and anti-VEGF therapies in a real-life setting. The study tests the 
effects of the 0.2 µg/day FAc implant in two different groups of patients: 
group 1 with prior laser-only treatment (n=7 eyes), and group 2 comprised 
of patients with a prior combination of laser and ≥3 monthly anti-VEGF 
therapy (n=10 eyes). At 12 months following administration of the 0.2 µg/
day FAc implant, DME decreased by 299 μm in group 1, and by 251 μm 
in group 2. The analysis used the AUC method to measure changes in 
BCVA, where 0.2 µg/day FAc implant treatment increased the mean area 
under the curve for pseudophakic patients from baseline to last value by 
+4.2 letters in group 1 and +9.5 letters in group 2.54 This showed a greater 
improvement in vision in patients who had previously received both laser 
and anti-VEGF therapy. 
Calculation of area under the curve
The lack of resources or knowledge is one of the main limitations to the 
use of AUC statistical analyses. Here, with hopes of providing more liberty 
to future investigators for using this statistical method, we are providing a 
cost-free approach with step-by-step instructions to analyze the AUC data 
using the R Statistical Software. The provided codes will analyze the data 
using one-way ANOVA followed with a pairwise t-student post-hoc test 
corrected with the Holm's sequential method to reduce the probability 
of type I error.

Step 1)    
Download “AUC.r”, “AUC_example.r”, and “YWZ.csv” from the 
supplementary section of this article. 
Step 2)    
Download R 3.3.2 (or newer versions) from r-cran directory:  
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
Step 3)   Run the installer and follow the instructions.
Step 4)    
Next, download and install RStudio:  
https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
Step 5)   Execute RStudio.
Step 6)    
Click the “Open an existing file” icon 
 (or press “Ctrl+O”) to 
open the “AUC.r” as well as “AUC_example.r” script with RStudio.
Step 7)    
Import the YWZ.csv data by clicking on the “Import Dataset” 
icon  
. The file must be saved in the R directory 
(which is usually located in the “documents” folder). Allow the 
program to install any required packages for importing .csv 
data. Browse and select your “YWZ” file from R-directory and 
then click import. 
Step 8)    
Click on the “AUC.r” script 
 on top-left corner of the page, 
highlight the entire text and then click Run 
 (if you cannot 
find the Run icon, then press “Ctrl+R”)
Step 9)    
Click on the “AUC_example.r” script 
, place the 
cursor on the first line, and execute the codes line-by-line all the 
way to the bottom by either clicking Run 
 or “Ctrl+R”.
Step 10)  
In the console section at left-bottom of the page, p-values are 
listed for statistical comparison of Y, W, and Z graphs.  
Notes for incorporation of your raw data: 
• You can modify numbers or add/delete rows in the YWZ.csv file. Please 
make sure to save the archive and re-import it to R from R-directory.
• Y, W, and Z each represent a separate variable (e.g., Implants) with their 
numeric outcome listed in front of them. The numbers in front of “TROT”, 
on the other hand, represent the timeline. All these values can be 
modified accordingly to incorporate your raw data for AUC calculations. 
• If you decide to add or subtract columns in your timeline (TROT), you 
must also adjust the mm matrix, (i in 2:12), and c(11,11,11) values in the 
“AUC_example.r” file. 
Summary and concluding remarks
As a result of improved understanding of the pathophysiological processes 
responsible for endothelial blood–retinal barrier breakdown in DME, new 
therapeutic options have emerged. Several VEGF inhibitors, including 
aflibercept, bevacizumab, pegaptanib and ranibizumab, have shown clinical 
efficacy as intravitreal therapies for DME. In addition, the 0.2 µg/day FAc 
implant and DEX are available as intravitreal implant systems releasing 
steroid for up to 36 months10, 39 and 4 to 6 months,55 respectively. However, 
variation in clinical endpoints can hinder comparisons of clinical trials of 
these agents and often only account for outcomes at a single time-point. 
As an alternative approach, the AUC method captures treatment benefit 
over the entire dosing period. Most DME subjects require treatment for 
multiple years, thus the AUC method is particularly relevant to assess 
therapies for DME. Using the AUC method, a significant visual acuity benefit 
that resulted from 0.2 µg/d FAc versus sham control during the FAME trials 
was demonstrated. In addition, the similarity between AUC and change in 
mean BCVA at month 36 supports the consistent benefit with continuous 
0.2 µg/d FAc therapy. A recent analysis of data from the FAME trials using 
the AUC method highlights the sustained benefits of the 0.2 µg/day FAc 
intravitreal implant in the treatment of DME. The AUC method therefore 
provides a complete assessment of efficacy over time and is particularly 
relevant for evaluating outcomes over a continued period of therapy.
