IMPORTANCE Numerous glucose-lowering drugs are used to treat type 2 diabetes.
OBJECTIVE To estimate the relative efficacy and safety associated with glucose-lowering
drugs including insulin.
DATA SOURCES Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and EMBASE
databases through March 21, 2016.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials of 24 weeks’or longer duration.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Random-effects network meta-analysis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was cardiovascular mortality.
Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, myocardial
infarction, stroke, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) level, treatment failure (rescue treatment or lack of
efficacy), hypoglycemia, and body weight.
RESULTS A total of 301 clinical trials (1 417 367 patient-months) were included; 177 trials
(56 598 patients) of drugs given as monotherapy; 109 trials (53 030 patients) of drugs added
to metformin (dual therapy); and 29 trials (10 598 patients) of drugs added to metformin and
sulfonylurea (triple therapy). There were no significant differences in associations between
any drug class as monotherapy, dual therapy, or triple therapy with odds of cardiovascular or
all-cause mortality. Compared with metformin, sulfonylurea (standardized mean difference
[SMD], 0.18 [95% CI, 0.01 to 0.34]), thiazolidinedione (SMD, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.00 to 0.31]),
DPP-4 inhibitor (SMD, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.13 to 0.52]), and α-glucosidase inhibitor (SMD, 0.35
[95% CI, 0.12 to 0.58]) monotherapy were associated with higher HbA1C levels. Sulfonylurea
(odds ratio [OR], 3.13 [95% CI, 2.39 to 4.12]; risk difference [RD], 10% [95% CI, 7% to 13%])
and basal insulin (OR, 17.9 [95% CI, 1.97 to 162]; RD, 10% [95% CI, 0.08% to 20%]) were
associated with greatest odds of hypoglycemia. When added to metformin, drugs were
associated with similar HbA1C levels, while SGLT-2 inhibitors offered the lowest odds of
hypoglycemia (OR, 0.12 [95% CI, 0.08 to 0.18]; RD, −22% [−27% to −18%]). When added to
metformin and sulfonylurea, GLP-1 receptor agonists were associated with the lowest odds of
hypoglycemia (OR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.39 to 0.94]; RD, −10% [95% CI, −18% to −2%]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with type 2 diabetes, there were no significant
differences in the associations between any of 9 available classes of glucose-lowering drugs
(alone or in combination) and the risk of cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. Metformin was
associated with lower or no significant difference in HbA1C levels compared with any other
drug classes. All drugs were estimated to be effective when added to metformin. These
findings are consistent with American Diabetes Association recommendations for using
metformin monotherapy as initial treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes and selection of
additional therapies based on patient-specific considerations.

D
iabetes was estimated to account for approximately
1.5 million deaths in 2012, with more than 80%
of diabetes-related deaths occurring in low- and
middle-income countries.1 In addition, diabetes was esti-
mated to cause disability (blindness, limb amputation,
kidney failure, cardiovascular events) among 47 million
people in 2010.2 Lifestyle modification and glucose-lowering
drug treatment are the mainstay of therapy to prevent and
delay diabetes-related complications. A large number of
glucose-lowering drug classes are approved for type 2 diabe-
tes, including metformin, insulins, sulfonylureas, thiazoli-
dinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors,
sodium-glucose–linked cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors,
glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, megli-
tinides, and α-glucosidase inhibitors.
American Diabetes Association guidelines suggest met-
formin as first-line drug treatment, and, if glycemic control is
not achieved, the addition of a second drug (often sulfonyl-
urea) is recommended.3 Triple therapy with 2 drugs added to
metformin is suggested when glycemic control is no longer
sustained with 2 drugs. Annual drug expenditure for glucose-
lowering therapy was estimated at $31.7 billion for 2012 in the
United States, with most patients receiving at least dual
therapy.4 However, despite the widespread use of these
drugs, the comparative effects of glucose-lowering strategies
on clinical outcomes, especially mortality and cardiovascular
events, are uncertain.5,6 Emerging evidence suggests that
SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists lower rates of a
composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial
infarction, or nonfatal stroke when the drug is added to stan-
dard care in high-risk patients.7,8 However, randomized clini-
cal trials of diabetes medications have been generally insuffi-
ciently powered to establish the role of drug treatment for
preventing cardiovascular death, limiting the ability of single
studies to inform practice and policy.
Head-to-head trials and standard meta-analysis do not al-
low all treatments to be compared simultaneously, constrain-

associated with available medications.6 Therefore, a system-
aticreviewwithnetworkmeta-analysiswasconductedtocom-
pare and rank glucose-lowering treatments for type 2 diabetes.
Methods
Study Design
A systematic review with network meta-analysis was con-
ducted with a frequentist approach using a prespecified study
protocol. Additional post hoc analyses and changes to the pro-
tocolaredescribedineMethods1intheSupplement.Thestudy
was reported according to the PRISMA extension statement for
network meta-analysis.9
Search Strategy and Selection Criteria
RandomizedclinicaltrialspubliclyavailableonMarch21,2016,
comparing2individualglucose-loweringdrugclassesfortreat-
ment of type 2 diabetes were identified. The Cochrane Library
Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and EMBASE
were searched using a highly sensitive search strategy devel-
oped by an experienced trials search coordinator for each da-
tabase (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Study Selection and Data Extraction
Parallel-group randomized clinical trials in which treatment
was given for 24 weeks or longer were included. Compari-
sons of the following drug classes were considered: metfor-
min, sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, DPP-4 inhibitor, SGLT2
inhibitor,GLP-1receptoragonist,basalinsulin,meglitinide,and
α-glucosidase inhibitor. Trials in which basal-bolus and pran-
dial insulin regimens were compared with the specified drug
classes of interest or placebo or standard therapy were also in-
cluded. Trials were considered within separate analytical net-
works based on whether drugs were given as monotherapy,
added to metformin (dual therapy), or added to metformin and
sulfonylurea (triple therapy). Metformin plus sulfonylurea was
chosen a priori as the baseline therapy for 3-drug combina-
tions, as this has been most widely used.10 Studies evaluating
treatments that were no longer available or withdrawn from
the market (eg, phenformin and troglitazone) were excluded,
as were those that did not principally act to lower blood glu-
cose levels. Studies evaluating treatment in children (18 years
or younger) and pregnant women were ineligible.
Two investigators (G.D.B., S.P.) screened the titles and ab-
stracts of retrieved citations independently to identify poten-
tially eligible trials. Any discrepancies were discussed be-
tween researchers until a consensus was reached. Any
potentially relevant citation was then retrieved in full-text and
reviewed by the same 2 investigators against the eligibility cri-
teria, and decisions about eligibility were double-checked in-
dependently by a third author (V.G.). Information in
non−English-language studies was formally translated be-
fore assessment. At least 2 investigators (S.C.P., D.W.J., J.M.,
V.G., G.D.B., M.R., P.N., V.S., S.B., Y.C., A.N., M.B., L.F., A.L.,
N.A., Y.L., and S.T.) independently reviewed the main reports
and supplementary materials, including data reported in the
ClinicalTrials.gov portal, and extracted study and patient char-
acteristics and treatment strategies. All extracted data were in-
dependently checked by 2 authors (S.P., J.M.).

tality was the primary end point. Secondary individual effi-
Key Points
Question What are the most effective medical treatments for
type 2 diabetes?
Findings In this systematic review with network meta-analysis,
risks of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality were not different
between any glucose-lowering drugs alone or in combination.
Metformin was associated with lower or similar HbA1C levels
compared with all other drugs given as monotherapy. All drugs
were estimated to be effective when added to metformin.
Meaning Metformin monotherapy is an appropriate initial
treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes. Selection of additional
therapies can be based on patient-specific considerations.

cacy end points were all-cause mortality, myocardial infarc-
tion,stroke,hemoglobinA1c(HbA1C)level,andtreatmentfailure
(lack of efficacy or need for rescue treatment). Secondary in-
dividual safety end points were serious adverse events, hypo-
glycemia, and body weight.
Quality Assessment—Risk of Bias
Two investigators (J.M., V.G.) used the Cochrane tool to as-
sess study risks of bias.11
Statistical Analysis
Detailed methods for statistical analysis were described in
eMethods 1 in the Supplement. The clinical setting and char-
acteristics of the trials (considering age, proportion of men,
HbA1C level, body weight, duration of diagnosed diabetes, du-
rationoffollow-up,andyearofpublication)reportingeachdrug
class were evaluated to consider whether the included trials
were sufficiently similar that a network meta-analysis ap-
proach was appropriate. Treatment effects were then esti-
mated by random-effects pairwise meta-analysis.12 The asso-
ciation between treatment and outcomes was estimated using
standardized mean differences (SMD) for HbA1C level and body
weight and odds ratios (ORs) for cardiovascular mortality, all-
cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, serious ad-
verse events, treatment failure, and hypoglycemia, together
with95%confidenceintervals.Ingeneral,anSMDof0.2iscon-
sidered small, 0.5 medium, and 0.8 large.13
Frequentist network meta-analysis was then used to com-
pare available treatment strategies within a single analytical
framework.14,15 Odds ratios were also accompanied by abso-
lute risk differences (RDs). Network meta-analysis was per-
formed in Stata version 13 (StataCorp) using the network com-
mand and self-programmed Stata routines.16,17 The relative
ranking probability of each treatment was estimated, and the
treatment hierarchy of competing interventions was ob-
tained using rankograms, surface under the cumulative rank-
ing (SUCRA) curves, and mean ranks. The restricted maxi-
mum likelihood method was used to estimate heterogeneity,
assumingacommonestimateforheterogeneityvarianceacross
different comparisons for a single clinical outcome.18 The ex-
tent of heterogeneity in each network analysis was evaluated
by comparing the magnitude of a common heterogeneity vari-
ance for the network (tau [τ]) with an empirical distribution
of heterogeneity variances, considering the range of ex-
pected treatment estimates (ORs and SMDs), in which values
of τ from 0.1 to 0.5 were reasonable, 0.5 to 1.0 were consid-
ered fairly high, and greater than 1.0 represented fairly ex-
treme heterogeneity.19-21
To explore for evidence of within-network inconsistency,
the loop-specific approach was used. This compared the esti-
mated treatment effects from head-to-head trials with corre-
sponding treatment estimates derived from triangular and
quadrilateral loops in the treatment network. A derived
inconsistency factor was the difference between ORs or
SMDs from direct and indirect evidence. An inconsistency
factor with wide confidence intervals indicated the need for
further investigation to identify possible sources of heteroge-
neity between direct and indirect evidence.22 To check the
assumption of consistency in the entire analytical network, a
“design-by-treatment” approach was used.23 A comparison-
adjusted funnel plot of treatment estimates for drug classes
as monotherapy on cardiovascular mortality was used to
assess for evidence of small-study effects. In addition,
random-effects bivariable network meta-regression analyses
were conducted to assess baseline HbA1C level, body weight,
duration of diagnosed diabetes, and age as effect modifiers
on estimates for end-of-treatment HbA1C level, body weight,
and hypoglycemia. Post hoc sensitivity analysis was per-
formed to assess for intraclass variation in the effect of indi-
vidual sulfonylurea drugs as monotherapy on odds of hypo-
glycemia. Additional post hoc sensitivity analyses were
conducted restricted to studies of monotherapy in which
allocation concealment was at low risk of bias.
Statistical testing was 2-sided, with P < .05 considered sta-
tistically significant.
Results
Electronic searching through March 21, 2016, retrieved 9819
citations (Figure 1). Overall, 301 randomized clinical trials in-
volving 118 094 patients were eligible for inclusion in the re-
view. In 177 trials (56 598 patients), drugs were given as mono-
therapy; in 109 trials (53 030 patients), drugs were added to
metformin; and in 29 trials (10 598 patients), drugs were added
to metformin and sulfonylurea therapy (eTables 2-4 in the
Supplement). The number of patients allocated to each treat-
ment in trials ranged between 824-26 and 156227 (median, 104
adults [interquartile range, 46-190]).
ThemeanHbA1Clevelatrandomizationwas8.2%(SD,1.1%)
in monotherapy trials, 8.2% (SD, 0.6%) in dual-therapy trials,
and 8.4% (SD, 0.6%) in triple-therapy trials. Mean body weight
at baseline was 81.9 (SD, 8.9) kg in monotherapy trials, 83.8
(SD,15.7)kgindual-therapytrials,and84.1(SD,9.5)kgintriple-
therapy trials. The median duration of diagnosed diabetes at
randomizationwas5.7(interquartilerange,3.3-7.0)years.Mean
study follow-up ranged between 24 weeks and 76.8 months
(median, 6 months [interquartile range, 5.5-12 months]).
The clinical trials were deemed sufficiently similar on the
basis of study-level age, sex, HbA1C level, body weight, dura-
tion of diagnosed diabetes, and duration of follow-up that a
networkanalysiswasappropriate,althoughnewerdrugclasses
(DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 receptor ago-
nists) were evaluated in trials published more recently (eFig-
ure 1 in the Supplement).
Risks of Bias
Overall, the risk of bias was high or unclear for random se-
quence generation in 208 trials (69.1%); concealment of treat-
ment allocation in 232 trials (77.1%); masking of participants,
masking of investigators, or both in 96 trials (31.9%); mask-
ing of outcome assessment in 281 trials (93.4%); complete-
ness of outcome reporting in 179 trials (59.5%); and selective
reporting of outcomes in 172 trials (57.5%) (eTables 5-7 in the
Supplement). The trial sponsor was involved in authorship,
data management, or both in 190 trials (63.1%).

Network Consistency
The networks of individual treatment end points are shown
in Figure 2 and eFigure 2 in the Supplement. Inconsistencies
betweendirectandindirectevidencewerenotedforsomedrug
comparisons (eFigures 3-5 in the Supplement), assessing dual
therapy(fortreatmentfailure,hypoglycemia,andbodyweight)
andtripletherapy(HbA1Clevelandhypoglycemia).Thedesign-
by-treatment interaction model did not identify global incon-
sistency in treatment networks (except treatment failure with
dual therapy and HbA1C level with 3-drug therapy) (eTable 8
in the Supplement). However, the confidence intervals for in-
consistencyinloopsofdrugcomparisonswereoftenverywide,
and robust conclusions about inconsistency could not be
drawn. When assuming a common heterogeneity variance
withintreatmentnetworksforbinaryoutcomes,therewasevi-
dence of low levels of heterogeneity in all networks with the
exception of HbA1C for dual therapy, in which there was evi-
dence of fairly high network heterogeneity (τ, 0.5-1.0) (eTable
9 in the Supplement). Definitions of treatment failure in the
included studies were generally lack of efficacy or need for ad-
ditional glucose-lowering therapy (eTable 10 in the Supple-
ment). Contributions of direct evidence to network analyses
were reported in eTable 11 in the Supplement.
Treatment Outcomes
Treatment effects in pairwise meta-analyses are shown in
eFigures 6-8 in the Supplement.
Drugs as Monotherapy: Primary Outcome
Twenty-five studies involving 14 477 adults evaluated the as-
sociationofdrugclassesasmonotherapywiththeprimaryout-
come of cardiovascular death, including a total of 67 events
during 197 763 patient-months of follow-up (Figure 2). There
werenosignificantdifferencesintheassociationsbetweenany
drug class as monotherapy with odds of cardiovascular mor-
tality (Table; eTable 12 in the Supplement). Data were absent
for basal insulin and GLP-1 receptor agonist monotherapy, and
rankings of drug classes for cardiovascular mortality were im-
precise (Figure 3).
Drugs as Monotherapy: Secondary Outcomes
All monotherapies had uncertain comparative associations
with all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, myocardial
infarction, and stroke (Table; eTable 12 in the Supplement). All
drugclassesasmonotherapywereassociatedwithlowerHbA1C
levels than placebo (SMDs ranging from −0.66 [95% CI, −0.88
to −0.44] for α-glucosidase inhibitors to −1.11 [95% CI, −1.44
to −0.77] for meglitinides). Compared with metformin, sulfo-
nylurea (SMD, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.10 to 0.34]), thiazolidinedione
(SMD, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.00 to 0.31]), DPP-4 inhibitor (SMD, 0.33
[95% CI, 0.13 to 0.52]), and α-glucosidase inhibitor (SMD, 0.35
[95% CI, 0.12 to 0.58]) monotherapy were associated with
higher HbA1C levels, while SGLT-2 inhibitors (SMD, 0.18 [95%
CI, −0.15 to 0.51]), basal insulin (SMD, 0.13 [95% CI, −0.24 to
0.51]), GLP-1 receptor agonists (SMD, −0.04 [95% CI, −0.31 to
0.23]), and meglitinides (SMD, −0.09 [95% CI, −0.42 to 0.24])
showed no significant difference in HbA1C levels. There was
limitedconfidenceinhierarchicaltreatmentrankingsforHbA1C
levels (Figure 3).28
Placebo was associated with the greatest odds of treat-
ment failure (OR vs metformin, 3.83 [95% CI, 2.88 to 5.10]; RD,
11% [95% CI, 8% to 14%]), while DPP-4 inhibitor (OR, 1.53 [95%
CI, 1.16 to 2.01]; RD, 3% [95% CI, 1% to 6%]) and meglitinide
(OR,2.58[1.43to4.66];RD,5%[1%to9%])monotherapieswere
also associated with higher odds of treatment failure com-
pared with metformin. SGLT-2 inhibitor treatment was asso-
ciated with the lowest odds of treatment failure (OR vs met-
formin, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.31 to 0.71]; RD, −0.3% [95% CI, −4%
to 3%]).
Basal insulin (OR, 17.9 [95% CI, 1.97 to 162]; RD, 10% [95%
CI, 0.08% to 20%]) or sulfonylurea (OR, 3.13 [95% CI, 2.39 to

mia, while placebo (OR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.40 to 0.83]; RD, −3%
[95% CI, −5% to −0.2%), thiazolidinediones (OR, 0.67 [95% CI,

hibitors (OR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.50 to 0.94; RD, −1% [95% CI, −4%
to 1%]) were associated with a lower risk of hypoglycemia than
metformin. Compared with metformin, GLP-1 receptor ago-
nist monotherapy was associated with a lower body weight
(SMD, −0.28 [95% CI, −0.52 to −0.04]), while sulfonylurea
(SMD, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.04 to 0.33]) and thiazolidinedione (SMD,
0.24[95%CI,0.04to0.43])monotherapywereassociatedwith
higher body weight.
Drugs Added to Metformin: Primary Outcome
Twenty-six trials involving 20 690 adults evaluated dual
therapy (drugs added to metformin) including 45 cardiovas-
cular deaths during 286 157 patient-months of dual therapy
(Figure 2). There was no significant association between any
drug class and odds of cardiovascular mortality (Table; eTable
13 in the Supplement). Data for basal insulin or α-glucosidase
inhibitors added to metformin were absent, and rankings of
drug classes for cardiovascular mortality were very impre-
cise (Figure 3).
Drugs Added to Metformin: Secondary Outcomes
There were no significant differences between any drug class
when added to metformin for odds of all-cause mortality,
serious adverse events, myocardial infarction, or stroke
(Table; eTable 13 in the Supplement), with the exception of a
lower odds of stroke associated with metformin + DPP-4
inhibitor vs metformin + sulfonylurea (OR, 0.47 [95% CI,
0.23 to 0.95]; RD, −0.2% [95% CI, −0.4% to −0.04%). When
considering efficacy, all drug classes as dual-therapy regi-
mens lowered HbA1C levels to a similar extent, although there
was fairly high statistical heterogeneity in this network.
Direct and indirect evidence tended to indicate similar
results, with the exception of the comparison between sulfo-
nylurea and placebo therapy when added to metformin
(eFigure 7 in the Supplement). Compared with metfor-
min + sulfonylurea, metformin + SGLT-2 inhibitor ranked the
best for avoiding treatment failure (OR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.48 to
0.96]; RD, −3% [95% CI, −6% to −0.8%]), while metfor-
min + α-glucosidase inhibitor (OR, 12.4 [95% CI, 1.84 to 83.3];
RD, 9% [95% CI, 1% to 17%]) and metformin + DPP-4 inhibi-
tor (OR, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.07 to 1.76]; RD, 1% [95% CI, −1% to
3%]) strategies were associated with higher odds of treatment
failure.
All dual-therapy classes were associated with lower odds
of hypoglycemia than metformin + sulfonylurea dual therapy,
with mean odds of hypoglycemia ranging from 0.56 (95% CI,
0.32 to 0.98; RD, −4% [95% CI, −12% to 5%]) for metfor-
min + basalinsulinto0.12(95%CI,0.08to0.18;RD,−22%[95%
CI, −27% to −18%]) for metformin + SGLT-2 inhibitor, which
wasrankedasthebestoptiontoavoidhypoglycemia(Figure3).
Metformin+sulfonylurea dual therapy was ranked worst for
body weight. Compared with metformin + sulfonylurea treat-
ment,metformin + DPP-4inhibitor(SMD,−0.58[95%CI,−1.06
to −0.11]), metformin + SGLT-2 inhibitor (SMD, −0.96 [95% CI,

−1.46to−0.47]),andmetformin + GLP-1receptoragonist(SMD,
−1.05 [95% CI, −1.54 to −0.57]) were associated with signifi-
cantly lower body weight at the end of treatment.
Drugs Added to Metformin and Sulfonylurea: Primary Outcome
Fivetrialsinvolving3267adultsevaluatedtripletherapy(drugs
added to metformin and sulfonylurea) (Figure 2), including 6
cardiovascular deaths during 37 223 patient-months of triple
therapy. There was no evidence of an association of any drug
class with cardiovascular mortality (Table; eTable 14 in the
Supplement). Data for meglitinides and α-glucosidase inhibi-
tors added to metformin and sulfonylurea were absent, and
rankings of drug classes for cardiovascular death were impre-
cise (Figure 3).
Drugs Added to Metformin and Sulfonylurea: Secondary Outcomes
There was no evidence of significantly different associations
with all-cause mortality or serious adverse events between any
of the drug classes given as triple therapy (Table; eTable 14 in
the Supplement). Insufficient observations were available to
generateevidencenetworksformyocardialinfarctionorstroke.
As add-ons to metformin and sulfonylurea, α-glucosidase
inhibitors ranked worst for lowering HbA1C levels, whereas
thiazolidinediones or basal insulin were best (Figure 3;
eTable 14 in the Supplement). α-Glucosidase inhibitors were
associated with higher HbA1C levels compared with thiazoli-
dinediones (SMD, 1.42 [95% CI, 0.57 to 2.26]), GLP-1 receptor
agonists (SMD, 1.34 [95% CI, 0.37 to 2.32]), and basal insulin
(SMD, 1.42 [95% CI, 0. 44 to 2.39]) when added to metformin
and sulfonylurea. Metformin + sulfonylurea + basal insulin
ranked best for avoiding treatment failure, whereas metfor-
min + sulfonylurea + DPP-4 inhibitor was the worst (Figure 3
and Table). Compared with thiazolidinedione given as triple
therapy, basal insulin was associated with lower odds of
treatment failure (OR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.20 to 0.99]; RD, −5%
[95% CI, −20% to 9%]), while metformin + sulfonyl-
urea + DPP-4 inhibitor was associated with higher odds of
treatment failure (OR, 2.20 [95% CI, 1.32 to 3.68]; RD, 21%
[95% CI, 7% to 35%]).
When added to metformin and sulfonylurea, GLP-1
receptor agonists were ranked best for avoiding hypoglyce-
mia, while thiazolidinediones ranked worst (Figure 4). GLP-1
receptor agonists were associated with lower odds of hypo-
glycemia than thiazolidinediones (OR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.39 to
0.94]; RD, −10% [95% CI, −18% to 2%]) in triple therapy.
When added to metformin and sulfonylurea, SGLT-2 inhibi-
tors were ranked best for minimizing weight gain, while thia-
zolidinediones and basal insulin ranked worst (Figure 4). All
other drug classes except basal insulin were associated with a
lower body weight than thiazolidinediones when added to
metformin and sulfonylurea (SMDs ranging from −0.23 [95%
CI, −0.46 to −0.00] for DPP-4 inhibitors and −0.23 [95% CI,
−0.39 to −0.06] for GLP-1 receptor agonists to −0.33 [95% CI,
−0.59 to −0.07] for SGLT-2 inhibitors).

a An odds ratio (OR) greater than 1 indicates that the outcome is more likely with treatment than the reference
intervention. A standardized mean difference (SMD) greater than 0 indicates a higher body weight or
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) level at end of treatment with the drug being considered compared with the reference
treatment. An SMD of 0.2 is considered to indicate a small difference between treatments, 0.5 a moderate
difference, and 0.8 a large difference. For example, sulfonylurea monotherapy was associated with a small
increase in mean HbA1C levels (SMD, 0.18) compared with metformin monotherapy, and this difference had a
95% probability of ranging between 0.01 and 0.34. Insufficient data were available to generate networks for
drug classes used as triple therapy and outcomes of myocardial infarction and stroke. Mean ORs or SMDs with
wide confidence intervals should be interpreted with caution (eg, the estimated odds of hypoglycemia
associated with basal insulin vs metformin was 17.9 and included a 95% CI of 1.97 to 162). The true odds of
hypoglycemia associated with treatment might be considerably different than the mean estimated effect
(OR, 17.9) and range from a small increase in hypoglycemia (OR, 1.97) to very high odds of hypoglycemia (OR,
162). Confidence intervals were wide for many drug comparisons and outcomes.
bTreatment effects were not estimable owing to an insufficient number of observations.

findings for drug classes as monotherapy when analyses were
restricted to trials at low risk of bias from allocation conceal-
ment (eTable 17 in the Supplement). Compared with metfor-
min, DPP-4 inhibitors were associated with moderately higher
HbA1C levels and higher odds of treatment failure and with
lower risks of hypoglycemia. Sulfonylurea monotherapy was
associated with higher odds of hypoglycemia compared with

Drug rankings for efficacy (cardiovascular mortality, treatment failure,
and hemoglobin A1c [HbA1C] levels). Drug classes are stratified according to
administration as monotherapy, as dual therapy in addition to metformin, or as
triple therapy in addition to metformin and sulfonylurea. The lines show the
probability of the drug ranking for each outcome between best and worst
(ranking first, second, third, etc), and the peak indicates the ranking with the
highest probability for the corresponding drug class. For example, for treatment
failure, sodium-glucose–linked transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor monotherapy
demonstrates a higher probability of ranking best than thiazolidinedione
monotherapy. Basal insulin monotherapy has a 50% probability of ranking as
the best drug for avoiding treatment failure and a 100% probability of ranking
the worst (13th best) for hypoglycemia (see Figure 4). Rankogram lines without
marked peaks (for example, for all drug classes as monotherapy and their
association with odds of cardiovascular mortality) indicate similar probabilities
of all rankings and lower confidence in comparative ranking of the relevant drug
class for that outcome. Rankograms showing no data indicate observations
were insufficient to generate a rankogram for the drug class for the
corresponding outcome. For example, there were insufficient data for
meglitinides as triple therapy to infer drug rankings for any outcome. Similarly,
there were insufficient data to infer drug rankings for α-glucosidase inhibitor
treatment in triple therapy for the outcome of cardiovascular mortality. The
peak of the rankogram curve can be used to assess probabilities of drug classes
between best and worst (for example, for treatment failure, SGLT-2 inhibitors,
and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists were most likely to be
among the best treatments and had similar ranking). DPP-4 indicates dipeptidyl
peptidase 4.

metformin. Treatment estimates for mortality and cardiovas-
cular events in high-quality trials were uninterpretable ow-
ing to wide confidence intervals.
Discussion
Consideringcumulativetrialdatafrom118 094adultswithtype
2 diabetes, there was no evidence of differences in the associa-
tions between glucose-lowering drugs alone or in combina-
tion with odds of cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality,
serious adverse events, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Con-
siderable uncertainty about the association of drug treatment
with cardiovascular mortality existed within trial evidence,
largely because of few events in most available studies.
Drugs as monotherapy were associated with large propor-
tionalreductionsinHbA1Clevelscomparedwithplacebo,while
metformin was associated with moderately lower HbA1C lev-
els compared with other drugs including sulfonylureas, thia-
zolidinediones, and DPP-4 inhibitors. Basal insulin and sulfo-
nylureas were associated with greatest odds of hypoglycemia,
with an absolute risk difference of 10% compared with met-
formin. Metformin was associated with small reductions in
bodyweightrelativetosulfonylureaorthiazolidinedionetreat-
ment. Considering these results, with metformin showing fa-
vorable associations with HbA1C levels compared with sulfo-
nylureas, thiazolidinediones, and DPP-4 inhibitors, and
without adverse signals for hypoglycemia or weight gain, met-
formin might be considered a reasonable first-line agent for
type 2 diabetes, consistent with the American Diabetes Asso-
ciation recommendations.3 However, the recommendations
also suggested a patient-centered approach—considering ef-
ficacy, weight gain, hypoglycemia, and comorbidities—when
selecting treatment. Therefore, based on this review, clini-
cians and patients may prefer to avoid sulfonylureas or basal
insulin for patients who wish to minimize hypoglycemia,

choose GLP-1 receptor agonists when weight management is
a priority, or consider SGLT-2 inhibitors based on their favor-
able combined safety and efficacy profile.
When drug classes were added to metformin, all were as-
sociated with large reductions in HbA1C levels, although net-
work heterogeneity lowered confidence in the results. SGLT-2
inhibitors were associated with less treatment failure com-
pared with sulfonylureas, while sulfonylurea therapy was as-
sociated with more frequent hypoglycemia and SGLT-2 inhibi-
tors ranked the best. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor
agonists were associated with less weight gain. When consid-
ering the addition of a second agent to metformin, the present
findings suggested a potential treatment hierarchy, with sul-
fonylurea therapy least preferred; SGLT-2 inhibitors sug-
gested for patients wishing to avoid hypoglycemia and mini-
mizetreatmentfailure;andSGLT-2inhibitorsorGLP-1receptor
agonists suggested for those for whom weight gain is a higher
priority. Given the lack of evidence that any regimen was su-
perior for hard clinical outcomes, decision makers (espe-
cially those in lower-resource settings) may consider whether
theadvantagesofSGLT-2inhibitorsoutweightheirhighercosts.
When added to metformin plus sulfonylurea, drugs had
similarassociationswithHbA1Clevels.Basalinsulinrankedbest
for avoiding treatment failure. GLP-1 receptor agonists posed
the lowest risks of hypoglycemia, while SGLT-2 inhibitors were
ranked best for weight gain. Considering these results, SGLT-2
inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, or basal insulin might all
be considered when adding a third agent to treatment. In ad-
dition, based on analysis of 2-drug combinations, metformin
plus sulfonylurea as the basis for adding a third agent ap-
peared to be least favorable, and 3-drug combinations that in-
clude other oral agents (particularly metformin plus SGLT-2 in-
hibitor) warrant further evaluation.
A central finding in this meta-analysis was that despite
morethan300availableclinicaltrialsinvolvingnearly120 000
adults and 1.4 million patient-months of treatment, there was
limited evidence that any glucose-lowering drug stratified by
coexisting treatment prolonged life expectancy or prevented
cardiovascular disease. Similarly, a trial in 14 671 individuals
adding sitagliptin to existing therapy showed no effect on car-
diovascular mortality over 3 years,29 while saxagliptin as
add-on treatment had no effect on mortality among 17 000 in-
dividuals at high cardiovascular risk.30 By contrast, the
EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial7 demonstrated proportional re-
ductions in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality with em-
pagliflozin added to existing care, while liraglutide added to
standardcareintheLEADERtrialpreventedcardiovascularand
all-cause death among patients at high cardiovascular risk.8
Although these trials represent emerging evidence of glucose-
lowering drug effects on mortality outcomes, none of these
trials analyzed treatment as monotherapy or added to met-
formin. Future trials might prioritize comparisons of SGLT-2
inhibitors against metformin or added to metformin to com-
pare specific dual-therapy regimens.
The present systematic review and network analysis ex-
tended findings from a 2011 pairwise meta-analysis of 166 ran-
domized clinical trials and observational studies examining
medicationsfortype2diabetesthatincludedassessmentsof1-
and 2-drug combinations.6 The network approach allowed

A funnel plot is a scatterplot of the study effect size vs some measure of its
precision, in this instance the standard error. A funnel plot that is asymmetrical
with respect to the line of the summary effect (vertical red line) implies there
are differences between the estimates derived from small and large studies. The
studies are ordered from best to worst according to effects on cardiovascular
mortality. Missing (small) studies lying on the right side of the zero line suggest
that small studies tend to exaggerate the effectiveness of higher-ranked
treatments compared with lower-ranked treatments. The cause of any small
study effects is explored by meta-regression and is not necessarily attributable
to publication bias (the absence of small, negative studies in the available
literature). Red line represents the null hypothesis that the study-specific effect
sizes do not differ from the respective comparison-specific pooled effect
estimates. The 2 black dashed lines represent a 95% confidence interval for the
difference between study-specific effect sizes and comparison-specific
summary estimates. yixy is the noted effect size in study i that compares x
with y. μxy is the comparison-specific summary estimate for x vs y. Treatments
are ordered by the surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve.

ediones and other drug classes on other cardiovascular com-
plications such as myocardial infarction and stroke.
The strengths of this review included the comprehensive
systematic search that considered trials published in lan-
guages other than English and those published only as con-
ference proceedings, the use of a prespecified protocol, and
double-checking of data extraction. However, there were sev-
eral limitations. First, analyses were limited by the amount of
data in the included studies. Although cardiovascular mortal-
ity was included as an outcome because of its central clinical
importance and the ongoing uncertainty about drug effective-
ness for this end point, only a minority of studies reported this
outcome, and most had few or zero events. In the network
analysis for cardiovascular mortality with monotherapy, the
mortalityratewasconsiderablylowerthanthatinarecentprag-
matictrialamongadultswithpreviouslyundetecteddiabetes,33
suggesting that investigators in future trials need to consider
drug evaluations in real-world settings in individuals with
higher morbidity and mortality risks. Randomized trials of suf-
ficientdurationandwithadequatestatisticalpowerareneeded
to detect treatment effects of diabetes drugs on mortality5 and
include consideration of disruptive trial designs such as reg-
istry-based trials to maximize trial efficiency and feasibility.
In addition, statistical inconsistency between direct and indi-
rect comparisons in some networks, including dual-therapy
associations with HbA1C levels, diminished the ability to draw
confident conclusions for some treatment effects. Second,
triple-therapy regimens evaluated in this study were limited
to individual drugs added to metformin and sulfonylurea
therapy, and the comparative effectiveness of other 3-drug
combinations was not assessed. Third, analyses have not been
adjusted for baseline kidney function; thus, findings may not
have been applicable to patients who have chronic kidney dis-
ease. A recent trial of empagliflozin added to standard therapy
(EMPA-REG OUTCOME)7 that included a subgroup of nearly
2000 adults who had chronic kidney disease found no evi-
dence of different risks of cardiovascular death with treat-
ment among people with kidney failure.7 Fourth, many of the
trials were conducted in higher-income countries. Medica-
tion use in lower-resource settings may be limited by cost and
drug availability. Fifth, most studies were short-term, and the
longer-term safety of the available drugs alone and in combi-
nation was incompletely understood.
Conclusions
Among adults with type 2 diabetes, there were no significant
differences in the associations between any of 9 available
classesofglucose-loweringdrugs(aloneorincombination)and
theriskofcardiovascularorall-causemortality.Metforminwas
associated with lower or no significant difference in HbA1C lev-
els compared with any of the other drug classes. All drugs were
estimatedtobeeffectivewhenaddedtometformin.Thesefind-
ings are consistent with American Diabetes Association rec-
ommendations for using metformin monotherapy as initial
treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes and selection of ad-
ditional therapies based on patient-specific considerations.
