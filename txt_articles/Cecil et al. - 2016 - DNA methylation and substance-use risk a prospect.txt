Epigenetic processes have been implicated in addiction; yet, it remains unclear whether these represent a risk factor and/or a
consequence of substance use. Here, we believe we conducted the first genome-wide, longitudinal study to investigate whether
DNA methylation patterns in early life prospectively associate with substance use in adolescence. The sample comprised of 244
youth (51% female) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), with repeated assessments of DNA
methylation (Illumina 450k array; cord blood at birth, whole blood at age 7) and substance use (tobacco, alcohol and cannabis use;
age 14–18). We found that, at birth, epigenetic variation across a tightly interconnected genetic network (n = 65 loci; qo0.05)
associated with greater levels of substance use during adolescence, as well as an earlier age of onset amongst users. Associations
were specific to the neonatal period and not observed at age 7. Key annotated genes included PACSIN1, NEUROD4 and NTRK2,
implicated in neurodevelopmental processes. Several of the identified loci were associated with known methylation quantitative
trait loci, and consequently likely to be under significant genetic control. Collectively, these 65 loci were also found to partially
mediate the effect of prenatal maternal tobacco smoking on adolescent substance use. Together, findings lend novel insights into
epigenetic correlates of substance use, highlight birth as a potentially sensitive window of biological vulnerability and provide
preliminary evidence of an indirect epigenetic pathway linking prenatal tobacco exposure and adolescent substance use.

INTRODUCTION
Substance abuse is a major public health concern that incurs
heavy costs to individuals, their families and wider society.
Collectively, it is estimated that one in ten of all fatalities result
from harmful use of alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs, representing
one of the leading preventable causes of death worldwide.1 In
addition, substance abuse is associated with a range of negative
outcomes
that
compromise
quality
of
life
and
long-term
productivity, including psychiatric illness, disability, criminality
and unemployment.2,3 Consequently, a key challenge for research
is to identify factors that drive individual susceptibility to
substance abuse, to inform effective prevention and early
intervention strategies.4
Like most complex phenotypes, substance abuse results from a
dynamic interplay of genetic and environmental influences.
Studies have shown
that the heritability of substance-use
disorders is moderate to high (~49–70%)5 and that this genetic
vulnerability interacts with environmental risk exposure. Indeed,
epidemiological studies have identified a number of pre- and
postnatal factors associated with substance abuse risk, including
substance exposure during pregnancy, parental psychopathology
and criminality, low socioeconomic status, childhood maltreat-
ment and affiliation with delinquent peers.6 However, the
biological mechanisms through which these effects are mediated
are poorly understood.
In recent years, epigenetic processes that regulate gene
expression7 have emerged as a potential mechanism of interest.
One of these processes, DNA methylation (DNAm), has received
increasing attention. DNAm modulates transcription via to the
addition of a methyl group to DNA base pairs, primarily in the
context of cytosine–guanine (CpG) dinucleotides.7 Studies have
shown that (i) DNAm is affected by genetic variability, as
demonstrated by the discovery of a large number of methylation
quantitative trait loci (mQTLs);8,9 (ii) DNAm is also sensitive to pre-
and postnatal environmental influences, including nutritional,
chemical and psychosocial factors (for example, prenatal tobacco
exposure);10,11 and (iii) aberrant patterns of DNAm have been
linked to a wide range of physical and psychiatric disorders,
including addiction.12 For example, animal studies have shown
that repeated drug administration (for example, alcohol and
cocaine) can lead to DNAm changes in reward-related regions of
the brain (for example, striatum).13 In turn, these changes can
influence the expression of genes involved in synaptic plasticity
and memory consolidation, driving neuroadaptations that under-
lie the onset and persistence of addictive behaviors.14 Importantly,
drug-induced epigenetic changes have been found to occur as
early as gestation.12 For example, a recent study in mice reported
an epigenetically-mediated effect of early nicotine exposure on
pup’s
neural
structure
and
behavior,
which
persisted
into
adulthood.15 So far, studies in humans have provided initial
support for animal findings, reporting methylomic differences
between substance abusers and drug-free controls across several
tissue types and substances.12,16

 Despite these promising findings, current research in humans
has been limited in four key ways.17 First, the vast majority of
studies
have
examined
adult
samples
already
exposed
to
substances. As a result, it has not been possible to establish
whether altered DNAm patterns are a risk factor for and/or
consequence of substance use. Disentangling these associations is
essential to better delineate the role of epigenetic mechanisms in
addiction risk and to enable the identification of novel therapeutic
targets. Second, because existing studies have typically included
DNAm data at a single time point, it is unclear whether epigenetic
effects may be observable across time or only during specific
developmental periods. This is particularly relevant given that
DNAm has been shown to be highly dynamic across the lifespan,
enabling cells to respond to changing internal and external
inputs.18 As such, clarifying how DNAm associates with substance
use over time may provide important insights into windows of
biological vulnerability. Third, little is known about what genetic
and environmental factors may underlie variability in DNAm
patterns associated with substance use. Characterizing these
potential influences may not only offer valuable opportunities for
preventative intervention, but also make it possible to test the role
of the epigenome as a potential mediator in the link between risk
exposure and later substance use. Finally, existing studies have
primarily focused on one type of substance at a time. Although
substance-specific risk factors have been identified, evidence from
both genetically-informative and epidemiological studies indicate
that substance-use risk across drug classes is largely accounted for
by a common underlying liability dimension.5,19 Consequently,
examining epigenetic markers common to multiple substances, in
addition to substance-specific markers, may help shed further
light into the biological basis of substance-use liability.
To address these gaps in the literature, we believe we
conducted the first genome-wide, prospective study to examine
associations between DNAm in early life (that is, collected at
repeated time points pre-substance-use initiation; birth and age 7)
and substance use in adolescence (measured as a latent factor
spanning tobacco, cannabis and alcohol use). Our aim was to
address the following key questions:
1. Are DNAm patterns at birth prospectively associated with
adolescent substance use?
2. Are these associations stable across early childhood (birth to
age 7)?
3. Do the identified DNAm markers associate with genetic and
environmental influences?
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
The Epigenetic Pathways to Conduct Problems Study consists of a
subsample of youth (n = 339) drawn from the Avon Longitudinal Study
of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) who (i) have repeated measures of
DNAm and (ii) follow previously established trajectories of conduct
problems (4–13 years).20 Only youth who had complete substance-use
ratings (age 14–18) as well as epigenetic data at birth and age 7 (n = 244,
54% female) were included in the present study. ALSPAC is an ongoing
epidemiological study of children born between 1991–92 from 14 541
women residing in Avon, UK. Of these initial pregnancies, there was a total
of 14 676 fetuses, resulting in 14 062 live births and 13 988 children who
were alive at 1 year of age.21 When compared with 1991 National Census
Data, the ALSPAC sample was found to be broadly similar to the UK
population as a whole.22 Informed consent was obtained from all ALSPAC
participants and ethical approval was obtained from the ALSPAC Law and
Ethics Committee and the Local Research Ethics Committees. Please note
that the study website contains details of all the data that is available
through a fully searchable data dictionary: http://www.bris.ac.uk/alspac/
researchers/data-access/data-dictionary/.
Measures
Adolescent substance use.
Substance use was assessed via self-report
ratings of tobacco and cannabis use (age 14, 16 and 18 using frequency
items ranging from ‘never’ to ‘daily’), as well as alcohol use (age 16 and 18
using the 10-item alcohol use disorders identification test).23 Confirmatory
factor analysis was used to extract (i) three first-order factors of tobacco,
cannabis and alcohol use, accounting for shared variance across time
points for each of these substances; and (ii) a single second-order factor of
substance use, accounting for shared variance between substances and
across time. The factor model showed adequate fit: χ2 (ref. 18) = 49.55;
Po0.01; comparative fit index = 0.91; Tucker–Lewis index = 0.86; root
mean square error of approximation = 0.08, 90% confidence intervals
(CIs) = 0.05, 0.10; with standardized loadings ranging from 0.58 to 0.96
(Supplementary Figure 1).
DNA methylation data.
A total of 500 ng high molecular weight genomic
DNA from blood (cord at birth, whole at age 7) was bisulfite-converted
using the EZ-DNA methylation kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA, USA).
DNAm was quantified using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip
(Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with arrays scanned using an Illumina iScan
(software version 3.3.28). Initial data quality control was conducted using
GenomeStudio (San Diego, CA, USA; version 2011.1) to determine the
status of staining, hybridization, target removal, bisulfite conversion,
specificity, non-polymorphic and negative controls. Samples that survived
this stage were quantile normalized using the dasen function within the
wateRmelon 1.0.3 package24 in R and batch-corrected using the ComBat
package.25 Probes were removed if they were cross-reactive, used for
sample identification on the array, or had a single-nucleotide polymorph-
ism at the single-base extension with a minor allele frequency larger than
5% (that is, common polymorphisms), leaving a total of 413 510
probes.26,27 DNAm levels are indexed by beta values (ratio of: methylated
signal/ methylated+unmethylated signal).
Prenatal environmental risks.
We included prenatal risks that have been
previously linked to adolescent substance use, including maternal prenatal
smoking, alcohol use and exposure to stressful events.6 Maternal smoking
and alcohol use during the first trimester of pregnancy were measured via
maternal ratings, using a yes/no binary variable for smoking (for biological
validation see the results section), and a 4-point scale for alcohol use
(‘never’ to ‘daily’). With regards to stress exposure, we included cumulative
risk scores of prenatal (18–32 weeks) adversity covering the following four
domains: (i) life events (for example, death in family and accident); (ii)
contextual risks (for example, poor housing and financial problems); (iii)
parental risks (for example, psychopathology and criminal behavior); and
(iv) interpersonal risks (for example, partner abuse and family conflict).
These cumulative risk scores were estimated using confirmatory factor
analysis based on maternal reports, as described elsewhere.28
Data analysis
Analyses were performed in R (version 3.0.1)29 and Mplus (version 6.1.1)30
adjusting for sex and cell-type proportions (CD8 T-lymphocytes, CD4
T-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, B-lymphocytes, monocytes), estimated
using the reference-based approach detailed in Houseman et al.31
Step 1: Are DNAm patterns at birth associated with adolescent substance
use?.
Genome-wide association analyses between DNAm at birth and
substance use were performed using the IMA package.32 Differentially
methylated probes (DMPs) passing a false discovery rate (FDR) correction
of qo0.05 were considered significant. These DMPs were then uploaded
to the UCSC genome browser (GRCh37/hg19 assembly)33 to explore their
potential functional relevance, by comparing their genomic location to
that of key regulatory elements recorded in the Encyclopedia of DNA
Elements (ENCODE) database (http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/), includ-
ing
(i)
transcription
factor binding
sites
(data
generated on 161
transcription
factors

types
via

(ii)

I
hypersensitivity clusters (based on data from 125 cell types) and (iii)
histone marks (only relevant cell lines examined, including blood
[GM12878, K562] and umbilical vein endothelial [HUVEC] cells).
Genes to which DMPs were annotated were then examined to identify (i)
underlying genetic networks, using the GeneMANIA bioinformatics soft-
ware, which is based on known genetic and physical interactions, shared
protein domains as well as co-expression data (http://www.genemania.org;
see Supplementary Table 1); and (ii) enriched biological pathways, by using
an optimized gene ontology method that controls for a range of potential
DNA methylation and substance-use risk

 confounds, including background probe distribution and gene size
(Supplementary Table 1).
As a supplement to the probe-level analysis, we also used the Comb-p
application within Python34 with default settings (P threshold: 1.00E − 04;
sliding window size: 500 bp), to identify wider differentially methylated
regions based on spatially-correlated P-values.
Step 2: Are these associations stable across early childhood (that is, birth to
age 7)?.
Given that DNAm is temporally dynamic18—particularly in early
development9—markers identified at one time point may not necessary
continue to be associated with substance use at other time points. To test
this, we examined whether DMPs identified in step 1 (that is, birth) were
also significantly associated of adolescent substance use at age 7 (that is,
follow-forward approach; FDR-corrected qo0.05).
Step 3: Do these markers relate to genetic and environmental influences?
As
a
last
step, we investigated potential
genetic and environmental
factors that may influence DNAm levels of the identified DMPs. Given
that
our
sample
was
underpowered
to
directly
examine
genetic
polymorphisms (that is, single-nucleotide polymorphisms) affecting DNAm,
we used the ALSPAC-derived mQTLdb resource (http://www.mqtldb.org/)
to search for known mQTLs associated with our DMPs (see Supplementary
Table 1 for further details). Potential environmental influences were
examined next by testing associations between prenatal exposures and
DMPs. Because of the large number of DMPs identified, we grouped these
into a single, cumulative DNAm risk score to minimize multiple testing
burden. Specifically, we applied a method typically used for polygenic risk
scores,35 where we multiplied the methylation values of our DMPs
by their respective standardized regression betas (that is, weights), and
then summed these together into a DNAm risk score. This approach
enabled us to reduce the volume of our methylation data, whereas the use
of weights ensured that DMPs maintained their relative predictive
importance (as opposed to alternative approaches, for example, averaging
DNAm levels across DMPs). Once calculated, we examined associations
between this DNAm risk score and prenatal exposures, using Pearson’s
bivariate correlations. Significant prenatal risks (qo0.05) were then
incorporated into a single path analytic model in Mplus (maximum
likelihood estimation), together with the DNAm risk score and the
substance use factor, to test for indirect effects. Associations in the model
were considered significant if they survived bootstrapped CIs (10 000
times).36 Significant paths (prenatal risks → DNAm → substance use) were
tested for an indirect effect using bootstrapped model constraint
statements.

RESULTS
Epigenome-wide association analysis at birth
At birth, 65 probes prospectively associated with adolescent
substance use after genome-wide correction (qo0.05; Table 1
and Figure 1a). Of these DMPs, 33 were ‘hypomethylated’ (that is,
lower DNAm associating with higher substance use), whereas the
other 32 were ‘hypermethylated’ (that is, higher DNAm associating
with higher substance use). Overall, DMPs were most frequently
located in the gene body (40%) or promoter region near the
transcription
start
site
(30%;
see
Supplementary
Table
2).
DNAm levels were significantly interrelated across the majority
of DMPs (76% of correlations = qo0.05; rmax = 0.58; rmin = − 0.52;
rabsolute
average = 0.20; see Supplementary Table 3). The most
significant
probe,
cg04941418
(P = 1.10E − 08;
q = 0.005,
Figure 1b), is located in PACSIN1, a developmentally regulated
gene that has an important role in synaptic neurotransmission,
axonal growth and dendritic branching.37,38 Other annotated
genes in the table include (i) SHC2 (cg02290110) and NTRK2
(cg01009697), both implicated in neuronal neurotrophin-activated
Trk receptor signaling,39,40 (ii) CLSTN1 (cg07395930), involved in
calcium-mediated
post-synaptic
signals,
and
(iii)
NEUROD4
(cg20056324), involved in neural differentiation. DMPs were then
uploaded in Genome Browser for functional characterization,
based on ENCODE data on regulatory elements. All DMPs
overlapped with histone marks; 62% (n = 40) coincided with
transcription factor binding sites; and 57% (n = 37) were located
within DNAse I hypersensitive clusters. Overall, 48% (n = 31)
of
DMPs
were
mapped
to
all
three
regulatory
elements
(Supplementary Table 4).
DMPs were annotated to a total of 60 genes, which were
examined further to identify underlying genetic networks and
enriched biological pathways. On the basis of GeneMANIA
analysis, 57 of the 60 genes were connected to form a compact
cluster network (Figure 1c). Our gene ontology analysis also
indicated that these genes are involved in a range of biological
processes, including regulation of JAK-STAT cascade, vasoconstric-
tion,
cytokine-mediated
signaling
and
axonogenesis
(2.30E − 18oPo3.37E − 03; Figure 1d). Of note, enriched cellular
components included axon part, post-synaptic membrane and
dendritic spine (2.94E − 04oPo3.09E − 03; for the full list of GO
terms, see Supplementary Table 5).
Results from the Comb-p analysis indicated that there were no
significant differentially methylated regions after genome-wide
correction.
Follow-forward at age 7
None of the DMPs identified at birth continued to prospectively
associate with adolescent substance use by age 7, after multiple
correction (q40.05; Supplementary Table 6). Two DMPs showed
nominal associations (cg02404636 [SFI1]: Std B = 0.21, P = 0.001;
cg20056324 [NEUROD4]: Std B = 0.13, P = 0.05), both following the
same direction of effects observed at birth. Given this lack of
temporal stability, we proceeded to test, for each DMP, how much
DNAm levels at birth correlated with those at age 7 (that is,
autocorrelation). We found that only 12 DMPs (18%) showed an
autocorrelation significant at Po0.05, 11 of which were in the
positive direction (across all DMPs: rmax = 0.67; rmin = − 0.13; rabsolute
average = 0.07). Interestingly, however, the pattern of intercorrela-
tions across DMPs at age 7 resembled that observed at birth
(Supplementary Figure 2). In other words, whereas DMPs typically
did not correlate with themselves over time, the way in which they
correlated with each-other within time points was very similar,
potentially reflecting a similar underlying co-methylation network.
Genetic and environmental influences
The 65 DMPs identified at birth were carried forward to explore
associations with potential genetic and environmental influences.
On the basis of the mQTLdb search, we found that five of the
DMPs were associated with known mQTLs (ncis = 4; ntrans = 1),
suggesting that DNAm levels across these sites are likely to be
under considerable genetic control (Supplementary Table 4). Of
note, temporal stability of these DMPs was stronger (raverage = 0.25)
than the average across all DMPs noted above, consistent with
what has previously been observed at the genome-wide level.9
With regards to environmental influences, we found that three
prenatal exposures significantly correlated with DNAm (measured
as a cumulative risk score comprising of all DMPs)—maternal
tobacco smoking, maternal risks and contextual risks (Table 2). To
test for indirect effects, we estimated a path analytic model
(Figure 2a) that included these three prenatal exposures, the
cumulative DNAm risk score, and the adolescent substance use
outcome. Maternal smoking was the only prenatal factor to
uniquely associate with higher cumulative DNAm risk (over and
above other exposures), which in turn associated with higher
substance use in adolescence (Figure 2b). Analysis of this pathway
indicated a significant indirect effect of maternal smoking on
substance use, via cumulative DNAm risk (unstandardized b = 0.19,
s.e. = 0.07, P = 0.01, bootstrapped 95% CI = 0.05–0.37). To minimize
the possibility that associations with prenatal exposures may
simply reflect genetic confounding, we reran analyses using a
cumulative DNAm risk score that did not include any of the DMPs

was
highly

(r = 0.99;

Follow-up analyses
PACSIN1: relevance to the brain.
PACSIN1cg04941418 emerged as
the top DMP at birth to associate with adolescent substance use.
Given that our DNAm data was extracted from peripheral blood,
we used the Genotype-Tissue Expression project portal (GTEx;
http://www.gtexportal.org/home/; 41 and the EMBL-EBI Expression
Atlas
(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/home/);42
to
assess
PACSIN1
expression across tissues. PACSIN1 was found to be most highly
expressed in brain tissue, including regions implicated in drug-
seeking behavior and addiction risk, such as the prefrontal cortex,
nucleus accumbens, amygdala and hippocampus (Supplementary
Figure 3). We then used the BrainCloud tool (http://braincloud.
jhmi.edu/plots/),43 to trace the developmental course of PACSIN1
expression across the lifespan (fetal–age 80), based on post-
mortem prefrontal cortex tissue from 269 healthy subjects. The
resulting
plot showed that
the
most
dramatic
change
in
expression levels occurs during the neonatal period, bridging
lower expression levels during fetal development with a higher,
stable trajectory of expression from around 3 months of age
onward (Supplementary Figure 3).
Age of substance-use onset.
Overall, 65 DMPs at birth prospec-
tively associated with substance-use severity in adolescence. As a
sensitivity analysis, we additionally tested whether these DMPs
also associated with age of onset among substance users. On the
basis of three items that combined self-report data across age 16
and 18, we found that, within youth who endorsed using
substances, higher cumulative DNAm risk correlated with lower

P = 0.03, nendorse = 129), ‘tried cannabis’ (r = − 0.36, P = 3.40E-04,
nendorse = 93) and ‘had whole alcoholic drink’ (r = − 0.23, P = 0.001,
nendorse = 195), respectively. For data on frequencies, correlations
and details about how the items were created, see Supplementary
Table 7.
Indirect effects for specific substances.
We found a significant
indirect effect of prenatal tobacco smoking on adolescent
substance use, via cumulative DNAm risk. Here, we wanted to
clarify whether this indirect effect was observed across all
substances or only specific ones (for example, adolescent tobacco
use). To this end, we reran the path analysis with the three
first-order
factors
of
tobacco,
cannabis
and
alcohol
use
(Supplementary Figure 4). Indirect effects were significant across
all three substance types (tobacco: b = 0.31, s.e. = 0.12, P = 0.01,
bootstrapped 95% CI = 0.09–0.59; cannabis: b = 0.71, s.e. = 0.29, P =
0.01, bootstrapped 95% CI = 0.22–1.34; alcohol: b = 0.14, s.e. = 0.06,
P = 0.03, bootstrapped 95% CI = 0.04–0.30). Because the first-order
factor of cannabis use contained one outlier (that is, 43 s.d. from
the mean), the analysis was also rerun with winsorized data for
this score and results remained consistent.
Biological validation of prenatal maternal smoking.
Finally, to
ensure the validity of our measure of prenatal smoking—which
was derived from a single yes (n = 48) /no (n = 213) item reported
by mothers—we ran an epigenome-wide analysis with prenatal
smoking predicting neonatal DNAm. As expected, the top
differentially
methylated
locus
was
cg05575921
(AHRR;
P = 6.96e − 16; q = 2.88E − 10, see Supplementary Table 8), a well-
established,
sensitive
and
specific
biomarker
of
tobacco
exposure.10,11,44 Of note, there was no overlap between the
maternal smoking and adolescent substance-use DMPs.
DISCUSSION
The aim of this study was to characterize DNA methylation
patterns prospectively associated with substance-use risk, using
longitudinal data spanning gestation to adolescence. We highlight
here three key findings: (i) epigenetic variation across 65 loci at
birth associated with higher tobacco, cannabis and alcohol use in
adolescence, as well as an earlier age of substance-use onset; (ii)
these effects were specific to the neonatal period and not
observed in mid-childhood; and (iii) several of the identified loci
were associated with known genetic mQTLs, and all, collectively,
mediated the effect of prenatal tobacco smoking on adolescent
substance use. These findings lend novel insights into epigenetic
predictors of substance use, highlight birth as a potentially
sensitive window of biological vulnerability and provide prelimin-
ary support for the role of DNAm as an indirect pathway linking
prenatal exposures to adolescent behavioral outcomes.
Epigenetic variation at birth associates with substance use in
adolescence
Although the impact of substance use on DNAm has been
repeatedly documented,12 less is known about the extent to
which DNAm may confer risk for substance use, as existing studies
have typically focused on adults already exposed to substances.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to address this gap by
Figure 2.

bootstrap-corrected confidence intervals (i.e., significant path). Red arrows show significant indirect path. Population effect sizes are

medium effect, and an effect of 0.37 is a large effect. (b) Graphical representation of the indirect effect, where prenatal smoking associates

 examining DNA collected before substance-use initiation. Further-
more, the use of a latent factor score comprising of tobacco,
cannabis and alcohol use enabled us to examine the potential role
of methylomic variation in broader substance-use liability. On the
basis of genome-wide analyses, we found that epigenetic
variation across 65 loci at birth associated with higher substance
use 14–18 years later, as well as an earlier age of onset among
substance users. These loci were annotated to genes that,
together, formed a compact underlying genetic network and
were enriched for a range of biological pathways, including neural
processes (for example, axonogenesis and synaptic transport) and
cellular components (for example, axon, dendritic spine and post-
synaptic membrane). The most differentially methylated locus was
annotated to PACSIN1, a developmentally-modulated gene that
has an important role glutamate neurotransmission, axonal
growth, dendritic branching and synaptic plasticity45 and that is
highly expressed in brain tissue,37,38 including regions implicated
in drug-seeking behavior and addiction risk (for example, nucleus
accumbens, frontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus).46 Other
key annotated genes also implicated in early brain development
included NEUROD4, involved in neuronal differentiation, and
NTRK2, a Trk receptor for multiple neurodevelopmental genes,
including brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neutrophin 4 and
nerve growth factor.40
The neonatal period as a potential window of biological
vulnerability
The inclusion of repeated DNAm measures enabled us to test the
stability of epigenetic effects during childhood. We found that
none of the loci identified at birth continued to predict substance
use by age 7 (after multiple correction). This specificity of effects
around birth is consistent with previous studies from our group
examining longitudinal associations between DNAm and devel-
opmental outcomes.28,47,48 Findings are also consistent with a
recent study based on the ALSPAC sample that reported low
genome-wide continuity in DNAm patterns over time,9 especially
when comparing birth to other time points. A number of factors
may drive the temporal differences observed. First, findings may
reflect tissue-specific DNAm patterns, as data was extracted from
two different blood sources (cord blood at birth vs whole blood at
age 7). Second, differences may reflect the specific timing of
environmental influences, whereby methylation patterns at birth
may be a more reliable proxy for intra-uterine risk exposures and
associated perturbations in fetal development,49 compared with
age 7. Third, the neonatal period may represent a particularly
sensitive window of biological vulnerability to future substance
use. For example, epigenetic patterns at birth may trigger
downstream developmental consequences resulting in enduring
individual differences (for example, in neural networks underlying
drug-seeking behavior and addiction)12,15 without the epigenetic
signature being maintained over time.18 Given that we still know
little about the role of tissue differences, environmental influences
and developmental processes on DNAm,50 the above explanations
are
inevitably
speculative
and
will
necessitate
further
investigation.
Genetic and environmental influences on DNAm patterns
associated with substance use
The identification of neonatal DNAm patterns associated with
adolescent substance use raises questions about what kind of
factors may drive this methylomic variation in the first place.
Evidence suggests that DNAm patterns8,10—like substance use
liability5,6—reflect the influence of both genetic and environ-
mental factors. On the basis of data from mQTLdb,9 we found that
5 of our 65 DMPs were associated with known mQTLs, suggesting
that they may be considerably influenced by genetic structure.
Although these associations point to potentially large genetic
effects on a relatively small number of our DMPs, it is important to
note that the heritability of DNAm patterns is greater than what
can currently be explained using known mQTLs.9 As such, genetic
effects on our other DMPs cannot be ruled out, especially the
presence of polygenic effects. With regards to environmental
influences, we found that three prenatal factors were associated
with cumulative DNAm risk at birth (comprising all DMPs):
maternal tobacco smoking (measured in the first trimester),
maternal risks
(for
example,
psychopathology
and
criminal
behavior) and contextual risks (for example, poor housing and
financial
problems).
Associations
remained
consistent
after
removing any mQTL-related DMP from our DNAm risk score to
minimize genetic confounding. These findings support the
presence of both genetic and environmental influences on
substance use related DNAm patterns. It is important to note,
however, that because associations were based on correlational
analyses, they should be interpreted with caution and considered
more as well-grounded hypotheses for further examination in
larger longitudinal studies.
DNAm as an indirect pathway linking prenatal smoking to
adolescent substance use
We found that one prenatal exposure—maternal tobacco smoking
—uniquely associated with substance use over and above other
exposures, and that this association was partially mediated by
cumulative DNAm risk at birth. Importantly, this indirect effect was
observed across all three substance types (not just tobacco use,
but also cannabis and alcohol use)—pointing to a potential link
between prenatal tobacco exposure and broader substance-use
liability. To our knowledge, this is the first example in humans of
an indirect effect of prenatal exposures on substance-related
outcomes via DNAm, consistent with recent work reported in
animals.15 However, due to the correlational nature of the
analyses, such evidence should be considered preliminary and
in need of rigorous assessment using advanced causal inference
methods (for example, two-step Mendelian randomization).51,52 In
particular, further work will be needed to trace the specific
biological pathways through which this indirect effect may be
expressed.
Experimental
studies
have
shown
that
prenatal
nicotine
exposure
causes
neuromorphological
changes
(for
example, dendritic branching, axonal growth and spine density)
in brain circuits underlying motivation, learning and reward-
processing, which in turn confer latent vulnerability for substance
use and other externalizing problems (for example, hyperactivity
and aggression).15,53,54 As such, it will be of interest to test
whether the observed effect of prenatal nicotine exposure on
substance use may be expressed via epigenetically-modulated
changes in neural development, organization and structure. This
will also require a more comprehensive investigation of DNAm in
the context of other epigenetic processes, which have also been
implicated in substance use and addiction (for example, histone
modifications and microRNAs, see Nestler14 for a review).
Limitations and future directions
Findings should be interpreted in light of a number of limitations.
First, the current study was based on a modestly sized population-
based sample of youth. At present, ALSPAC is the only cohort, to
our knowledge, that is prospective enough to enable the
examination of neonatal DNAm patterns associated with adoles-
cent substance use. Consequently, we were unable to replicate
our results in an independent sample. In future, it will be
important
to
test
the
robustness
of
findings
using
other
epidemiological cohorts, as well as establishing the relevance of
the identified markers in the development of more severe clinical
phenotypes, including substance abuse and dependence. Second,
findings were based on DNAm from peripheral samples; as such,
more research will be needed to establish the relevance of the
DNA methylation and substance-use risk

 identified markers to brain function. Future studies incorporating
imaging data will be important for establishing whether these
markers associate with structural or functional alterations in
addiction-relevant neural pathways (for example, related to
reward-processing,
impulse
control,
learning
and
memory),
contributing
to
a
more
mechanistic
understanding
of
the
identified associations. Third, functional characterization of the
DMPs was performed using ENCODE data, as we did not have
access to RNA. Integration of transcriptomic data will mark an
important step toward establishing the downstream effects of the
observed DNAm changes on gene expression. Fourth, despite the
fact that we identified prospective associations between DNAm
and substance use (that is, DNAm collected before initiation of
substance use), it is not possible to establish causality. Finally, the
study focused exclusively on DNA methylation,
and other
epigenetic processes (for example, histone modifications and
microRNAs) are likely to be important in mediating the onset and
consequences of addiction.14
CONCLUSIONS
The present findings lend novel insights into early epigenetic
correlates of substance use, pinpointing specific markers for future
interrogation. Evidence of temporally-specific effects points to
birth as a potentially sensitive window of biological vulnerability,
which may particularly benefit from intervention efforts. Findings
also highlight prenatal smoking as an important prevention target,
and contribute to a better understanding of the biological
mechanisms through which tobacco exposure during pregnancy
may increase risk for future substance use.
