Abstract
Context: Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) are
associated with physical and psychological morbidity, and large societal costs. The long-
term effects of delivery modes on each kind of incontinence remain uncertain.
Objective: To investigate the long-term impact of delivery mode on SUI and UUI.
Evidence acquisition: We searched Medline, Scopus, CINAHL, and relevant major con-
ference abstracts up to October 31, 2014, including any observational study with
adjusted analyses or any randomized trial addressing the association between delivery
mode and SUI or UUI �1 yr after delivery. Two reviewers extracted data, including
incidence/prevalence of SUI and UUI by delivery modes, and assessed risk of bias.
Evidence synthesis: Pooled estimates from 15 eligible studies demonstrated an
increased risk of SUI after vaginal delivery versus cesarean section (adjusted odds ratio
[aOR]: 1.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.56–2.19; I2 = 57%; risk difference: 8.2%).

Introduction
Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is defined as the involun-
tary loss of urine on effort or physical exertion, or on
sneezing or coughing. Urgency urinary incontinence (UUI)
is defined as involuntary loss of urine associated with a
sudden and compelling desire to pass urine [1]. Both from
the population perspective and from an individual perspec-
tive, SUI and UUI are the most burdensome and bothersome
of all urinary symptoms in women [2]. SUI and UUI are
associated with substantial physical and psychological
morbidity, and large societal costs [3,4]. Established risk
factors for urinary incontinence include age and body mass
index (BMI) [5]; the prevalence of these conditions is
therefore likely to increase with future demographic
changes.
Although advances in treatment during the last two
decades have decreased morbidity, primary prevention of
long-term SUI and UUI remains highly desirable. Mode of
delivery is one potentially modifiable risk factor. Vaginal
childbirth is known to have major impacts on the pelvic
floor, weakening bladder neck support [6] and compromis-
ing innervation [7]. Cesarean delivery, particularly prelabor
cesarean, is believed to offer substantial protection against
such pelvic floor trauma; in contrast, assisted vaginal
delivery, with vacuum or forceps, is believed to carry
increased risks of trauma. The World Health Organization
statement on caesarean section rates recommends that the
ideal rate for cesarean sections is between 10% and 15%
[8]. Observed rates, however, vary widely between coun-
tries.
Although
rates
are
<10%
in
most
low-income
countries [9], middle- and high-income countries have
seen substantial increases since the 1970s. In 2011 rates
were 24% in the United Kingdom [10], 33% in the United
States [11], and 54% in Brazil [12]. The increasing use of
cesarean section has substantial negative public health
consequences, including peripartum infection, bleeding,
and thrombosis, and it has an impact on future pregnancies
[8]. Any positive consequences from the increased use of
cesarean have not been well quantified.
An extensive body of evidence from the first year after
delivery demonstrates that in this initial postpartum period,
rates of SUI are higher in women delivering vaginally than
those delivering by cesarean [13,14]. The long-term effects
of delivery mode, however, are more important to patients
than transient postpartum incontinence. Therefore to reach
a better understanding of the association between individ-
ual delivery modes and the long-term risk of SUI and UUI,
we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis.
2.
Evidence acquisition
We
registered
the
protocol
(PROSPERO
2013:
CRD42013006213) and followed the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guidance
[15].
2.1.
Search strategy
An experienced research librarian (M.A.) collaborated in
planning the search strategy, performed on October 31,
2014, in Medline (1946 to present), Scopus (1995 to
present), and CINAHL (1960 to present). We also searched
abstracts published from the annual meetings of the
International Continence Society and the International
Urogynecological Association (1999–2014). The searches
were conducted without language restrictions and adapted
for each electronic database. The details of searches are
available in Supplement 1.
2.2.
Study selection
We included any randomized trial, cross-sectional, or
cohort study that recorded the delivery mode as well as
SUI and/or UUI outcome beyond 1 yr after delivery among
primi- and multiparous women and provided an analysis
comparing at least two delivery modes with SUI and/or UUI.
Because
previous studies
have established
prognostic
factors for SUI and UUI [16–20], we included only cross-
sectional or cohort studies with an analysis that adjusted/
matched for at least one of the following: age [3,16], BMI
[17,19,20], or parity [18].
Because SUI and UUI have different etiologies [21–23],
we excluded studies that reported on incontinence but did
not report specifically on either SUI or UUI (eg, ‘‘any urinary
incontinence’’). We also excluded studies that only reported
surrogate measures, such as urodynamic testing, cough
stress test, or treatment rates. Reasoning that small studies
[8_TD$DIF]Metaregression demonstrated a larger effect of vaginal delivery among younger women
(p = 0.005). Four studies suggested no difference in the risk of SUI between spontaneous
vaginal and instrumental delivery (aOR: 1.11; 95% CI, 0.84–1.45; I2 = 50%). Eight studies
suggested an elevated risk of UUI after vaginal delivery versus cesarean section (aOR: 1.30;
95% CI, 1.02–1.65; I2 = 37%; risk difference: 2.6%).
Conclusions: Compared with cesarean section, vaginal delivery is associated with an almost
twofold increase in the risk of long-term SUI, with an absolute increase of 8%, and an effect
that is largest in younger women. There is also an increased risk of UUI, with an absolute
increase of approximately 3%.
Patient summary: In this systematic review we looked for the long-term effects of
childbirth on urinary leakage. We found that vaginal delivery is associated with an almost
twofold increase in the risk of developing leakage with exertion, compared with cesarean
section, with a smaller effect [9_TD$DIF]on leakage in association with urgency.

 are likely to be published only if they show anomalous
results, we excluded studies with <100 participants. We
accepted the definition of SUI and UUI used in each study,
recognizing there would be heterogeneity in definitions,
provided definitions captured the women’s own perception
of incontinence.
2.3.
Data extraction and risk of bias assessment
We
used
standard
methods
for
screening
and
data
extraction of systematic reviews (details in Supplement 2).
[10_TD$DIF]For the risk of bias [1_TD$DIF]assessments, we evaluated each study
according to six criteria: sampling and representativeness of
population, assessment of the exposure, assessment of the
outcome, presence of the outcome at the start of study,
adjustment for confounding, and missing data (Supplemen-
tary Table 1). For each criterion, we judged studies to have
either a high or low riskof bias. Studies with a high risk of bias
for two or more criteria were classified as high risk of
bias overall.
2.4.
Data synthesis and analysis
For our primary analyses, we examined the association
between mode of delivery and SUI or UUI. We calculated
pooled estimates of adjusted estimates using the DerSimo-
nian-Laird random-effects inverse variance method, and the
I2 statistic [24] and Cochran’s Q as indices of heterogeneity.
We used prespecified hypotheses to examine heterogeneity
using metaregression analysis weighted by the inverse of
the variance in a random-effects model. We examined the
following variables as potential sources of heterogeneity:
age (as continuous variable), parity (as continuous vari-
able), risk of bias (low vs high), composition of vaginal
delivery group (including women delivering only ever by
vaginal routes vs including women with both vaginal and
cesarean deliveries), and the case definition of SUI or UUI
(inclusive
mild
incontinence
definitions
vs
restrictive
severe definitions). We had prespecified hypotheses that
effect sizes would be smaller for samples of older women,
samples with higher parity, low risk of bias studies, mixed
modes of delivery, and studies using a lower threshold (less
severe symptoms) in their case definitions. We conducted a
single sensitivity analysis including a randomized trial
omitted from
the
primary
analysis
because
of
large
crossover and concerns regarding applicability (all breech
presentations).
To calculate the absolute risk increase of moderate or
severe SUI or UUI with vaginal birth, we estimated the
absolute risk of SUI or UUI after cesarean section using two
large population-based studies [25,26]: 12.2% for moderate
or severe SUI and 10.1% for moderate or severe UUI after any
cesarean section, and 5.0% for SUI after elective cesarean
section, and then used the odds ratio (OR) to calculate the
absolute risk increase with vaginal delivery [27].
When primary papers had missing confidence interval
(CI) information (ie, providing ORs and p values but not CIs),
we calculated the CIs (further information on data analysis
in Supplement 3). Meta-analyses were performed using
metan [28] and metareg in Stata v12.1 (StataCorp, College
Station, TX, USA). We used the Harbord test to detect
publication bias.

Literature search and study characteristics
Our search yielded 3487 potentially relevant reports. After
screening titles and abstracts, we retrieved 179 reports for
full-text screening, of which 18 proved eligible. Of these 18,
we did not include two studies in meta-analyses: a large-
scale multicenter randomized trial of planned cesarean
versus planned vaginal delivery due to low generalizability
because it only included women with fetuses with breech
presentations [29–31]; and a small cohort study [32] that
combined spontaneous vaginal delivery and cesarean during
labor and compared with vacuum or forceps. Of 16 studies
included [5,25,26,33–47], 8 addressed the impact of delivery
mode on SUI, 7 on both SUI and UUI, and 1 on UUI
(Tables 1 and 2; Fig. 1). In these studies we identified
11 different comparisons between delivery modes assessing
risk of SUI and 5 different comparisons assessing risk of UUI
(Supplementary Fig. 1). The most common comparison was
any vaginal delivery (including studies with spontaneous
vaginal delivery only, vaginal delivery only, or at least one
vaginal delivery) versus cesarean section (15 studies with
45 659 women for SUI and 8 studies with 49 623 women for
UUI) for both SUI and UUI, followed by instrumental delivery
versus spontaneous vaginal delivery for SUI (4 studies with
7417 women) (Figs. 2–4; Supplementary Fig. 1 and 2).
Table 1 provides a description of the 16 studies. Table 2
provides authors’ definitions of SUI and UUI. Three of the
studies included only primiparous women [26,37,46]. SUI
prevalence estimates varied from 9% to 68%; UUI from 8% to
27%. Six (37.5%) of the 16 authors confirmed the accuracy of

We identified only two prospective studies [30,40]. One

fetuses presenting in breech position. In this study there
was a significant crossover between groups: for women
randomized to planned cesarean section group, 941 (90.4%)
delivered by cesarean section, but for those randomized to
the planned vaginal delivery group, only 591 (56.7%) were
delivered vaginally. The study assessed rates of SUI for the
‘‘previous 7 d’’ at 3 mo, and for the ‘‘previous 3–6 mo’’ at
2 yr, which likely explains the observed higher rates of SUI
at 2 yr compared with 3 mo. At 3 mo postpartum, the
authors noted a lower rate of SUI among women assigned to

 planned cesarean section compared with planned vaginal
delivery (4.5% vs 7.3%; p = 0.02). At 2 yr, the difference
between groups was no longer significant (17.8% vs 21.8%;
p = 0.14). Inclusion of this trial in a sensitivity analysis did
not materially change the results (adjusted odds ratio
[aOR]: 1.78; 95% CI, 1.51–2.10; risk difference: 7.6%).
The other prospective study [40] reported longitudinal
changes of pelvic floor disorders for parous women with
and without a history of vaginal delivery. This study
recruited women at 5–10 yr after a first birth to annual
follow-up over 5 yr. At the baseline assessment (no
difference in maternal age or in time from first delivery
to study enrollment between groups), the prevalence of SUI
was 54% in vaginal versus 20% in cesarean delivery; for UUI,
prevalence was 17% in vaginal and 7% in cesarean delivery.
We used cross-sectional analyses of these baseline data
[33,34] in our meta-analyses. The longitudinal data collec-
tion demonstrated that differences between vaginal and
cesarean section diminished over time from delivery.
3.2.
Risk of bias
In all studies, women undergoing different delivery modes
were drawn from the same database, over the same time
frame, and we judged the assessment of mode of delivery
exposure as accurate. Eight studies nevertheless met
criteria for[5_TD$DIF] high risk of bias (Supplement 4 and Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3). Thirteen studies (81%) had little missing data or
used self-reported validated questionnaires or another
method with demonstrated validity. Twelve studies (75%)
adjusted/matched for all the most important confounders
(age, BMI, parity). No study collected information regarding
SUI or UUI before delivery.
3.3.
Impact of delivery mode on stress and urgency urinary
incontinence
In the pooled analysis (15 studies: 7 low and 8 high risk of
bias), the odds of reporting SUI was almost double after any
vaginal delivery (spontaneous or assisted) (aOR: 1.85; 95%
CI,
1.56–2.19;
heterogeneity:
p = 0.003;
I2 = 57%;
risk
difference: 8.2%) compared with any cesarean section. All
studies but one [36] suggested an increased risk, and in
12 of 15 studies the CI excluded no effect (Fig. 2). When
comparing elective cesarean with the decision made before
the onset of labor only, two (both high risk of bias) studies
[20,28] reported a risk of SUI over three times higher with
vaginal delivery (aOR: 3.53; 95% CI, 2.55–4.90; heterogene-
ity: p = 0.84; I2 = 0%; risk difference: 10.7%).
The pooled analysis (four studies, two low and two high
risk of bias) demonstrated no significant difference in SUI
between instrumental delivery, including vacuum and
forceps, and spontaneous vaginal delivery (aOR: 1.11;
95%
CI,
0.84–1.45;
heterogeneity:
p = 0.11;
I2 = 50%)
(Supplementary Fig. 2). The results were similar when
comparing vacuum with spontaneous vaginal delivery (two
studies, both high risk of bias; aOR: 1.10; 95% CI, 0.80–1.51;
heterogeneity: p = 0.60; I2 = 0%) [31,38] or forceps to
spontaneous vaginal delivery (three studies, two low and
one high risk of bias; aOR: 1.16; 95% CI, 0.71–1.89;
heterogeneity: p = 0.06, I2 = 65%) [5,34,38].
The pooled analysis (eight studies, three low and five
high risk of bias) demonstrated that the risk of UUI was
modestly increased after vaginal delivery when compared
with cesarean delivery (aOR: 1.30; 95% CI, 1.02–1.65;
heterogeneity: p = 0.14; I2 = 37%; risk difference: 2.6%)
(Fig. 3). No study reported the impact of elective cesarean
only versus vaginal delivery on UUI.
One low risk of bias study [48] compared vacuum
deliveries with a combination of spontaneous vaginal
deliveries and forceps deliveries (aOR: 0.8; 95% CI, 0.6–1.0
for SUI; and aOR: 1.2; 95% CI, 0.7–2.2 for UUI), and forceps
deliveries to a combination of spontaneous vaginal deliveries
and vacuum deliveries (aOR: 0.9; 95% CI, 0.7–1.1 for SUI; and
aOR: 0.8; 95% CI, 0.4–1.5 for UUI). One high risk of bias study
[41] compared the risk of UUI between vacuum and
spontaneous vaginal delivery (aOR: 1.03; 95% CI, 0.64–1.67
in our reanalysis adjusted for age and parity using data
provided by authors).
One high risk of bias study [33] reported no significant
differences between cesarean in the first stage of labor
versus elective cesarean (aOR: 0.88; 95% CI, 0.40–1.91) or
cesarean in the second stage of labor versus elective
cesarean (aOR: 1.30; 95% CI, 0.57–2.95) but had more than a
fourfold risk of SUI (aOR: 4.45; 95% CI, 2.14–9.27) in
instrumental delivery versus elective cesarean.
3.4.
Variability across studies
Mean age and parity of study populations, case definition of
SUI and UUI, definition of vaginal delivery groups, risk of
bias,
and
survey
methods
varied
across
studies
(Tables 1 and 2). In the 15 studies addressing the association
between vaginal versus cesarean delivery and SUI, in
univariable metaregressions we found that the mean
sample
age
at
ascertainment
of
outcome
(p = 0.005)
modified the effect of delivery mode on SUI (older age,
smaller effect). Other hypothesized effect modifiers were
nonsignificant in univariable metaregression. Based on
the results of the metaregression, we were able to calculate
the estimated OR for the association between delivery mode
and SUI, at various levels of mean sample age (Fig. 4).
Ascertained at age 30, the OR associated with vaginal
delivery was 2.51 (95% CI, 1.96–3.21); ascertained at age 60,
the OR was 1.29 (95% CI, 0.97–1.72).
In addressing the risk of UUI between vaginal delivery
and cesarean, the small number of studies limited the
power
of
the
metaregressions.
We
did
not
identify
statistically significant sources of heterogeneity in effect
size for these meta-analyses. There was no evidence of
publication bias, either on visual inspection of funnel plots
(Supplementary Fig. 4) or when applying the Harbord test.
3.5.
Discussion
This systematic review examining the association between
delivery mode and the presence of SUI and UUI >1 yr after
delivery
identified
11
different
comparisons
between
E U R O P E A N U R O L O G Y 7 0 ( 2 0 1 6 ) 1 4 8 – 1 5 8
154
 delivery modes assessing risk of SUI and 5 different
comparisons assessing risk of UUI. Meta-analysis of data
from 15 cross-sectional studies demonstrated an almost
twofold increase in the risk of developing long-term SUI, an
absolute increase of approximately 8% in moderate or
severe SUI when comparing any vaginal delivery with
cesarean section. The impact was age dependent and
decreased in cohorts of older women. Ascertained at age
30, the OR associated with vaginal delivery versus cesarean
was 2.51; ascertained at age 60, the OR was 1.29. This
difference in gradient reflects the increasing incidence of
incontinence for reasons other than mode of delivery as
women age.
When SUI was compared with specifically elective
cesarean, the risk was over three times higher, an absolute
increase of >10%. Meta-analysis also showed a small
increased risk of UUI after vaginal delivery compared with
cesarean, an absolute increase of approximately 3%. Results
showed no difference in the risk of SUI when comparing
instrumental vaginal delivery and spontaneous vaginal
delivery.
Aside from one randomized trial [29–31] including only
breech presentations, only one optimally adjusted longitu-
dinal study addressed the question of interest [40]. In this
study, symptoms related to SUI and UUI were more
common and of greater severity after vaginal than cesarean
birth. Consistent with results in our metaregression of age
on effect size, SUI symptom differences between these two
groups decreased with increasing time from childbirth.
3.6.
Strengths and limitations
The strengths of our study include the comprehensive
search without language restrictions, the duplicate assess-
ment of eligibility and data abstraction, the appraisal of risk
of bias, and the contribution of authors of primary studies to
confirmation and clarification of our data abstraction. We
used appropriate statistical methods to generate pooled
estimates and explored possible sources of heterogeneity,
demonstrating that apparent effects of spontaneous vaginal
delivery versus cesarean section on SUI decreased with
increasing age of assessment of SUI. We have also separately
quantified the larger benefit associated with elective
prelabor cesarean, compared with any cesarean section
(either before or during labor). Finally, we not only
estimated relative effects but also provided absolute
estimates.
The limitations of our review are largely the weaknesses
of the eligible studies. Investigators have conducted only
one randomized trial [30] and only one prospective cohort
study [40] examining the impact of delivery mode on SUI
and UUI. Although there were numerous comparisons
between delivery modes assessing the risk of SUI and UUI, it
was frequently impossible to compare data quantitatively.
In particular, most primary studies combined all cesarean
sections, irrespective of timing. We were able to conduct
analyses specifically for prelabor cesarean compared with
vaginal delivery, but we were not able to compare prelabor
cesarean with cesarean after cervical dilatation; nor were
we able to compare elective cesarean with planned vaginal
delivery (ie, including both vaginal deliveries and cesarean
after cervical dilatation). Furthermore, the effect estimates
in the analysis comparing instrumental delivery and
cesarean section, and elective cesarean and vaginal delivery
were imprecise due to lack of statistical power. None of the
studies collected information about SUI or UUI before
delivery. In addition, 11 studies had unknown follow-up
time [5,25,36,38,39,41,42,44–47]. However,[12_TD$DIF] the median of
mean/median ages of the women included in these studies
was >40 yr, implying that these studies also examined long-
term impact of delivery mode on SUI and UUI.
As in all large-scale studies of incontinence, the included
primary studies used self-report of incontinence, rather
than diagnoses reached using urodynamics. We consider
that self-report of SUI or UUI provides the most patient-
relevant outcome. However, symptomatic incontinence
may show limited correlation with urodynamic diagnosis,
and thus these findings should not be generalized to
diagnoses of urodynamic SUI or detrusor overactivity [49].
3.7.
Relation to prior work
Although previous systematic reviews have demonstrated
an increased risk of early postpartum incontinence after
vaginal delivery compared with cesarean section [13,14],
investigators have not previously conducted a rigorous
review of long-term effects. One earlier systematic review
focused entirely on the short-term postpartum period and
included only studies with follow-up <1 yr [14], whereas
the other one [13] included two appropriately adjusted
cross-sectional studies of incontinence beyond the first
postpartum year [37,43]. In contrast, our own search found
16 studies that could be included in meta-analyses. These
much larger pooled analyses have provided more precise
estimates of the impact of vaginal delivery compared with
cesarean section on SUI.
The potential impact of delivery mode on UUI has
received little consideration compared with the impact of
delivery mode on SUI [21]. The only available prior review
found no statistically significant difference between vaginal
delivery and cesarean section [13]. In our much larger
pooled analysis of eight studies (including 49 623 women),
we were able to detect a modest effect size with tight CIs.
For the first time, we have also been able to perform a
quantitative synthesis of studies of instrumental delivery,
finding no impact on SUI.
3.8.
Implications of findings
Incontinence is very common among women irrespective of
delivery history: prevalence estimates vary from 2.8% to
30.8% for SUI and from 0.7% to 19.9% for UUI [50,51].
Hence potentially increasing use of cesarean section may
have
beneficial
public
health
consequences
from
the
perspective of pelvic floor health, including decreased need
for SUI and pelvic organ prolapse surgery [52,53]. Our results
are consistent with those of a Swedish cohort study that
reported vaginal deliveries increased surgical treatment

ratio:

compared with women only having cesarean deliveries.
The increased risk persisted for >3 decades [52]. The
estimates provided here may be useful when counseling
women about the risk and benefits of different delivery
modes. Although we have quantified one benefit of planned
cesarean, women and their caregivers must consider other
consequences. Planned cesarean section confers an increased
risk of neonatal intensive care admission for the baby and a
substantially longer hospital stay for the mother [54]. A prior
cesarean also carries risks in future pregnancies, including an
increased risk of uterine rupture and abnormal placentation
[54]. In general, the medicalization of pregnancy associated
with planned cesarean may also be undesirable from both
individual and societal perspectives [55].

Conclusions
Our results demonstrate that vaginal delivery is associated
with almost double the odds of long-term SUI, an absolute
increase
of
approximately
8%
when
compared
with
cesarean section. The effect is largest in younger women
but diminishes with age. The odds of UUI is also increased
after vaginal delivery, but the pooled absolute difference is
sufficiently small (3%) that cesarean section rates have only
a small impact on UUI at a population level. The available
evidence suggests no difference in the odds of SUI, if
planned vaginal delivery results in instrumental delivery
instead
of
spontaneous
vaginal
delivery.
These
data
quantify one important aspect of cesarean section, to help
women and their physicians make decisions regarding
mode of delivery.
