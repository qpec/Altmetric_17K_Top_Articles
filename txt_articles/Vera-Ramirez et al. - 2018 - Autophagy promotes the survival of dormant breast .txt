recurrence

Cancer recurrence after initial diagnosis and treatment is a major cause of breast cancer (BC)
mortality, which results from the metastatic outbreak of dormant tumour cells. Alterations in
the tumour microenvironment can trigger signalling pathways in dormant cells leading to
their proliferation. However, processes involved in the initial and the long-term survival of
disseminated dormant BC cells remain largely unknown. Here we show that autophagy is a
critical mechanism for the survival of disseminated dormant BC cells. Pharmacologic or
genetic inhibition of autophagy in dormant BC cells results in significantly decreased cell
survival and metastatic burden in mouse and human 3D in vitro and in vivo preclinical models
of dormancy. In vivo experiments identify autophagy gene autophagy-related 7 (ATG7) to be
essential for autophagy activation. Mechanistically, inhibition of the autophagic flux in
dormant BC cells leads to the accumulation of damaged mitochondria and reactive oxygen
species (ROS), resulting in cell apoptosis.

inety percent of BC-related deaths are due to metastatic
disease1. Despite metastasis being the leading cause of
BC-related mortality, the molecular mechanisms of
metastatic progression remain poorly understood2. Although
most patients do not present with overt metastases at diagnosis, a
significant number succumb to disseminated disease years after
the removal and treatment of the primary tumour. Disseminated
tumour cells (DTCs) have frequently been observed at early stages
of BC suggesting that late recurrence of BC may result from
DTCs that have remained quiescent for decades3,4. Signals that
trigger the outgrowth of dormant cancer cells remain largely
unknown, although the tumour microenvironment plays a critical
role in this process5–7.
We previously developed and validated in vitro and in vivo
model systems to study BC dormancy8–10. Briefly, the D2A1 and
D2.0 R tumour cell lines (derived from murine mammary
hyperplastic alveolar nodules11,12) form primary tumours when
injected into the mammary fat pad of mice and disseminate to the
lungs. D2A1 cells form macrometastases in the lungs within
~1–3 weeks. In contrast D2.0 R cells remain dormant at the
metastatic site for about 4 months before forming relatively few
lung metastases13. The 3D in vitro system has been shown to be
predictive of the dormant or proliferative phenotype of several
mouse and human BC cell lines8. D2.0 R and MCF-7 cells remain
quiescent on basal membrane extract (BME) matrices for 12 days
whereas the highly metastatic D2A1, MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells
spontaneously outbreak into a proliferative state between day 1
and 6 of culture on BME8. These studies demonstrated that
changes in the microenvironment, including exposure to collagen
1 (COL1) or fibronectin, induce the dormant-to-proliferative
switch of D2.0 R cells8,10. In vivo studies are consistent with these
in vitro findings, where lung fibrosis induced by the intranasal
instillation
of
a
transforming
growth
factor
beta
(TGFβ)
expressing adenoviral vector drives the proliferative outbreak of
otherwise dormant D2.0 R cells when seeded to the lungs by tail
vein injection9. We have previously shown that the dormant-to-
proliferative switch of D2.0 R cells requires the activation of
integrin β1 receptor and downstream signalling through focal
adhesion kinase (FAK), Src, ERK1/2 and myosin light chain
kinase (MLCK) leading to actin stress fibre formation8,9. More-
over, the pharmacological inhibition of Src and MEK prevented
the proliferative outbreak of dormant D2.0 R cells14 in vivo.
Little is understood about the processes associated with the
survival
of
disseminated
dormant
tumour
cells.
Although
autophagy
has
been
proposed
as
a
potential
mechanism
promoting dormant cancer cell survival, few studies have
addressed this experimentally15–18. Autophagy is an evolutiona-
rily conserved mechanism of cell survival activated in response to
metabolic stress to degrade organelles, misfolded proteins and
portions of the cytosol to ensure proper energy balance under
nutrient deprivation conditions and to recycle dysfunctional
organelles and macromolecules19.
In this study, we demonstrate that pharmacologic or genetic
inhibition of autophagy greatly impairs the survival of dormant
BC cells in vitro and in vivo, but has minimal effect on metastatic
growth once dormant cells have transitioned to a proliferative
state. Moreover, inhibition of autophagy results in the accumu-
lation of damaged mitochondria and oxidative stress that drives
apoptotic cell death. Inhibition of autophagy may therefore be a
potential mechanism to eliminate dormant tumour cells and
prevent recurrence of BC.
Results
Solitary dormant tumour cells are autophagic. To investigate
the occurrence of autophagy in dormant breast tumour cells, we
analysed the expression pattern of Microtubule-associated protein
1 A/1B-light chain 3 (MAP1LC3, also known as LC3) and
Lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) over time in
D2.0 R cells on BME (cells remain dormant) and BME plus COL1
matrices (which induces proliferation of the dormant cells)8
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Consistent with activation of autophagy,
D2.0 R cells in BME showed increased expression of LAMP1 and
LC3 over time. In contrast, D2.0 R cells in BME plus collagen 1
(COL1) exhibited much lower levels of LAMP1 and LC3 staining
throughout the 8-day time course (Fig. 1a, b). Validation of
autophagy in D2.0 R cells on BME was demonstrated using a
tandem fluorescent-tagged LC3B reporter containing mCherry
and EGFP (mCherry-EGFP-LC3) that allows real time monitor-
ing of autophagic flux in live cells20 (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Yellow LC3 puncta (early autophagosomes not yet fused with
lysosomes) were detected in 81.25% of dormant D2.0 R cells at
Day 5 of culture. This percentage dropped down to 3.12% at Day
8 (Fig. 1c, d), at which time 68.75% of dormant D2.0 R cells
exhibited red-only fluorescent puncta (mature autolysosomes)
(Fig. 1c). We conclude that the non-proliferating BC cells are
autophagic while in a dormant state.
Autophagy inhibition decreases viability of dormant cells. To
test the functional importance of autophagy in BC dormancy,
D2.0 R cells were seeded on BME and treated with 50 μM
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an inhibitor of autophagy21, (based
upon a dose-response analysis; see Supplementary Fig. 3a) either
immediately or after 5 days in culture (Supplementary Fig. 4a).
We observed a significant increase in the percentage of dead D2.0
R cells, regardless of when the treatment with HCQ was initiated.
Likewise, the number of viable cells decreased across the 11 days
of culture under the immediate or delayed treatment conditions
(Fig. 2a). Similar results were observed when D2.0 R seeded on
BME matrices were treated with other autophagy inhibitors, such
as 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) or Bafilomycin (Supplementary
Fig. 3b). Conversely, HCQ treatment did not affect the viability of
proliferating D2.0 R cells on BME + COL1 (Fig. 2b). To visualise
apoptotic and proliferative events under these conditions, cells
were treated with HCQ at Day 7 of culture and stained for
proliferation
(Ki67)
and
apoptosis
(cleaved
Caspase 3 (cCASP3)) markers at Day 11 (Supplementary Fig. 4b).
After treatment, the percentage of cCASP3-positive D2.0 R cells
on BME significantly increased with respect to the non-treated
control (Fig. 2c, upper panels and d). In contrast, the proliferative
and apoptotic indexes of growing D2.0 R cells in BME plus COL1
were not affected by the treatment (Fig. 2c, lower panels, and e).
We tested the effect of autophagy inhibition on D2A1 cells
seeded on BME matrices before and after their dormant-to-
proliferative switch which occurs after 4–6 days of culture8
(Supplementary Fig. 1). We observed a significant increase in the
percentage of dead cells when HCQ was added immediately after
the cells were seeded on BME matrices (Fig. 3a). However,
beginning treatment of proliferating D2A1 cells on day 7
resulted in a two-fold decrease in the percentage of dead cells
compared to cells treated at day 5 of culture, before they undergo
the dormant-to-proliferative switch (Fig. 3a).
Interestingly, the proliferation rate of D2A1 cells on BME
treated from Day 7 of culture did not increase over time as much
as their non-treated counterparts (Fig. 3a). This result raised the
question of whether HCQ treatment reverted proliferating
D2A1 cells into a quiescent state or, alternatively, whether the
fraction of dead D2A1 cells resulting from HCQ treatment
significantly reduced the growth kinetics of the entire cell
population.
To
answer
this
question,

determined
the
proliferative and apoptotic indexes of D2A1 cells on BME treated

 with HCQ at Day 7 of culture. After 4 days of HCQ treatment the
percentage
of
D2A1
cells

higher
levels
of

significantly
increased
when
compared
with
the
untreated control. However, the proliferative index determined
by ki67 staining was not different (Fig. 3b), confirming that
surviving D2A1 cells continue proliferating at the same rate as
their untreated counterparts.
Human BC MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells have been
previously shown to exhibit comparable proliferative behaviour
to D2.0 R and D2A (dormant vs. proliferative, respectively) in 3D
culture (Supplementary Fig. 1) and in vivo8. To further
investigate the role of autophagy in BC dormancy using human
models, we seeded MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells on BME
matrices and either treated the cultures immediately with HCQ or
delayed treatment until day 5 (Supplementary Fig. 4a). HCQ
significantly reduced the number of viable quiescent MCF7 cells
whereas HCQ did not reduce the number of viable proliferative
MDA-MB-231 cells, similar to the responses to HCQ observed
for D2.0 R and D2A1 cells on BME, respectively (Fig. 3c, d).
Collectively, these results demonstrate that mouse and human
metastatic BC cells in a dormant state are sensitive to autophagy
inhibition whereas proliferative cells are resistant.
Lung metastatic burden is reduced by autophagy inhibition.
Based on our in vitro results, we investigated the effect of
inhibiting autophagy on metastatic outbreak in vivo, using our
previously described D2.0 R TGFβ fibrotic lung dormant-to-
proliferative switch model9 (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Otherwise
dormant D2.0 R cells become proliferative when introduced to a
fibrotic lung environment.
The administration of 50 mg/kg HCQ to animals nasally
instilled with empty adenovirus (Ad-empty; inducing a non-
fibrotic, dormancy-permissive lung microenvironment) consis-
tently resulted in a significant decrease in the average metastatic
burden compared to untreated mice (Supplementary Fig. 5b). In
animals induced to develop lung fibrosis with adenovirus
TGFβ223/225 that results in metastatic outgrowth of dormant
cells, we observed a 36-fold decrease of total metastatic burden in
HCQ-treated mice as compared to controls (Supplementary
Fig. 5b; representative images in Supplementary Fig. 5c).
Consistent with the in vitro data described above, treatment with
HCQ shortly after injection of D2.0 R cells significantly reduced
the
metastatic
burden
in
mice
either
with
or
without
fibrosis, confirming the in vivo efficacy of inhibiting autophagy
to reduce survival and metastatic outbreak of disseminated
dormant BC cells.
Autophagy blockade selectively targets dormant BC cells. We
next investigated whether administration of HCQ following the
proliferative outbreak of dormant cells in a fibrotic environment

 would impact the metastatic burden in vivo (Fig. 4a). As expec-
ted, the administration of HCQ to animals instilled with Ad-
empty resulted in a significant decrease of the average metastatic
burden, regardless of when the treatment was initiated (Fig. 4b).
However, in the fibrosis setting, autophagy inhibition after the
proliferative lesions had developed (treatment-delay group) was
remarkably less effective in reducing metastatic lesions, leading to
a higher metastatic burden in the treatment-delay group as
compared with the treatment group (Fig. 4b) (representative
images of the metastatic lesions in Fig. 4c and Supplementary
Fig. 6).
To assess the long-term effects of autophagy inhibition on
disseminated BC cells, the experiment was extended for an
additional 9 weeks following treatment cessation (Fig. 4d). The
results recapitulated those obtained in the previous experiment,
except that within the fibrosis setting the metastatic burden of
control and treatment-delay groups was no longer significantly
different (Fig. 4e). These data suggested that the surviving
population of metastatic cells in a fibrotic environment after
treatment with HCQ continued proliferating during the extended
experimental time.
To further demonstrate the specificity of autophagy blockade
in eliminating dormant BC cells, D2.0 R cells labelled with
mCherry-EGFP-LC3 were tail vein injected in mice 3 weeks after
nasal instillation with Ad-empty or Ad-TGFβ223/225 (Methods
and Supplementary Fig. 7). Remarkably, most D2.0 R cells

 maintained high autophagic flux during the first seven days both
in non-fibrotic and fibrotic lungs. However, after 21 days the
percentage of high autophagy flux cells in the lungs of mice
instilled with Ad-empty significantly increased compared to mice
bearing fibrotic lungs (Fig. 4f). These data further confirmed that
autophagy is a critical survival process activated and maintained
in dormant BC cells, which is shut down after the cells undergo
the dormant-to-proliferative switch.

 findings, the delay of HCQ administration for 7 days after cell
injection resulted in equivalent metastatic total tumour burden
compared to controls (Fig. 5a, b) suggesting that inhibition of
autophagy has a minimal effect once the dormant-to-proliferative
switch has occurred. To further investigate this effect, we per-
formed a time course experiment addressing the activation status
of autophagy in D2A1 cells before and after their proliferative
outbreak in vitro. Figure 5c clearly shows the progressive con-
version of LC3-I to its lipidated form LC3-II, indicating the
activation of autophagy, from day 3 to day 7 of culture. This
period of time overlaps with the quiescent phase of D2A1 cells on
BME matrices. On the other hand, a sharp decrease in the
expression of both LC3 forms is observable at day 11 of culture, at
which D2A1 cells have established a stable proliferative profile
when cultured on BME matrices.
Transcriptome analysis of dormant and proliferating BC cells.
To elucidate the molecular mechanism driving the dependence of
dormant BC cells on autophagy, we interrogated the tran-
scriptomes of D2.0 R cells in early and late stages of dormancy
and during proliferation. Pathway analysis of differentially
expressed genes of D2.0 R at Days 1 and 5 on BME revealed the
modulation of signalling pathways previously associated with
dormancy, such as the ERK/MAPK pathway, integrin-mediated
signalling or angiogenesis inhibition by Thrombospondin 1
(TSP1) (Fig. 6a), but not pathways related to autophagy. We
further examined the transcriptomes of D2.0 R cells on BME and
COL1-enriched BME matrices at Day 5 of culture. Pathway
analysis revealed autophagy as the most prevalent upregulated
pathway in the dormant cells compared to proliferating cells at
this time point (p = 2.5E−11; Fig. 6b, c, Supplementary Table 1

 and 2). These results suggest that the onset of the cellular tran-
scriptional programme leading to autophagy occurs relatively
early during the transition from a proliferative state in 2D culture
to a dormant state on BME.
Given the frequent post-translational modifications associated
with autophagy19, we validated the transcriptomic data by
analysing the protein levels of key molecules in the autophagic
signalling pathway. We confirmed that autophagy was active in
dormant D2.0 R cells on BME compared to proliferating D2.0 R
cells cultured in COL1-enriched BME matrices. We further
demonstrated that the protein levels of key autophagy effectors
were modulated in accordance with the transcriptional profile of
cells seeded on BME at day 5 as compared with those on BME at
Day 1 (Fig. 6d). ATG7 and LC3-II were upregulated and p62
downregulated in D2.0 R cells on BME at day 5 as compared with
the D2.0 R cells at Day 1, while BECN1 remained unchanged
(Fig. 6d). Taken together these data indicate that the differences
observed in the autophagic activity of dormant D2.0 R cells reflect
changes at the posttranscriptional level.
In addition, we showed that treating dormant D2.0 R cells with
HCQ blocked the autophagic flux. Notably, we observed a strong
accumulation of p6222 and LC3-II23 in D2.0 R cells treated with
HCQ at day 5 of culture on BME (Fig. 6d). Surprisingly, BECN1
protein levels dramatically decreased upon HCQ treatment.
Knockdown of ATG7 but not BECN1 reduces metastatic
burden. Next, we aimed to confirm the critical role of autophagy
in the survival of dormant cells and the involvement of ATG7 and
BECN1. We performed an in vivo metastasis burden assay using
D2.0R-GFP cells expressing scrambled shRNA (sh-SCR) and two
independent short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) for each of the
autophagy
regulators,
BECN1
and
ATG7
(Supplementary
Fig. 8a). In accordance with the transcriptomic data, we observed
no significant differences in the metastatic burden of mice
injected with either BECN1 shRNA or sh-SCR cells (Fig. 6e),
whereas
expression

sh-ATG7
hairpins
induced
an
approximately 2-fold reduction in total lung metastatic burden as
compared to controls (Fig. 6f).
Inhibition of autophagy in dormant cells blocks mitophagy.
RNAseq data also suggested that genes critically involved in
mitophagy and apoptosis were differentially regulated upon
autophagy activation (Supplementary Table 2). Mitophagy is a
type of selective autophagic survival pathway which eliminates
damaged or excessive mitochondria24. Western blotting analysis
of MTOC-1 and TOM20 showed a striking accumulation of these
two mitochondrial
markers
upon autophagy
inhibition in
dormant D2.0 R cells on BME at day 5 (Fig. 7a). In addition, we
analysed protein levels of PTEN-induced putative kinase protein
1
(PINK1),
which
activates
mitophagy
in
response
to
mitochondrial damage25. We found that dormant BC cells cul-
tured on BME for 5 days showed an increase in the active 66-kDa
full-length PINK1 isoform (Fig. 7a)26. A decreased expression of
both full length and cleaved PINK1 was observed in the HCQ-
treated dormant D2.0 R cells. Consistent with the hypothesis that
mitophagy blockade and the accumulation of mitochondria
would promote cellular damage and death, we found increased
levels of ɣH2Ax and cCASP3 in dormant D2.0 R cells treated with
HCQ, as compared with non-treated D2.0 R cells on BME or
BME plus COL matrices (Fig. 7a). Considering that dormant
D2.0 R cells undergo cell apoptosis following autophagy inhibi-
tion, the unexpected decrease in the expression of BECN1 and
PINK1 in dormant D2.0 R treated with HCQ (Figs. 6d and 7a,
respectively) might reflect the increased susceptibility of these
molecules to proteolysis during apoptosis. Indeed, caspase-
mediated cleavage of BECN1 has been previously reported27.
Indeed, we observed a sharp decrease in the expression of other
cytoplasmic proteins upon HCQ treatment of D2.0 R cells on
BME, such as β-actin or α/β-tubulin (Supplementary Fig. 8b),
possibly accounting for the high proteolytic activity in apoptotic
D2.0 R cells under these conditions.
Analysis of the potential physical interaction between autop-
hagosomes and mitochondria in dormant D2.0 R cells revealed
that an average of 75% of the mitochondrial mass in dormant
D2.0 R cells on BME co-localised with LC3-GFP in autophago-
somal structures at day 5 of culture, while no co-localisation was
detectable in proliferating cells on BME plus COL1 at any time

 (Fig. 7b). Consistent with these findings, dormant D2.0 R cells on
BME at day 5 accumulated more mitochondria when treated with
HCQ compared to untreated D2.0 R cells. Furthermore, the
accumulation of mitochondria in dormant D2.0 R cells treated
with HCQ was accompanied by an increase in mitochondrial
ROS and a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential
(Fig. 7c), suggesting that the blockade of autophagic flux inhibited
the clearance of damaged mitochondria producing toxic by-
products, including mitochondrial superoxide. The later observa-
tion was confirmed by rescuing D2.0 R viability upon treatment
with HCQ through the addition of the mitochondrial-targeted
ROS scavenger MitoTEMPO to the 3D cultures. Both the
percentage of dead D2.0 R cells and the caspase 3 and 7 activities
were significantly decreased by the presence of MitoTEMPO in
the 3D culture after cells were treated with HCQ at day 5 of
culture (Fig. 7d).
Discussion
The role of autophagy in cancer is complex since it can both
suppress cancer initiation and promote the growth and main-
tenance of established tumours28. Recent investigations suggest
that autophagy facilitates multiple steps in the metastatic cas-
cade29,30. Indeed, a role for autophagy in supporting tumour cell
dormancy has been suggested15 but experimental evidence has
been limited17,18. The results described in this study demonstrate
that BC cells utilise autophagy while in a dormant state. Further,
inhibition of autophagy drastically impairs the survival of dor-
mant BC cells in vitro and in vivo.
Importantly, autophagy inhibition does not induce apoptosis in
proliferating cells, underscoring the specificity of the toxic effect
of autophagy blockade in dormant BC cells. Although autophagy
inhibition impedes the survival of dormant D2.0 R BC cells in 3D
culture and in vivo, delaying the anti-autophagic treatment until
after the dormant-to-proliferative switch has occurred, sig-
nificantly reduces the cell population undergoing apoptotic cell
death. Importantly, extended follow-up of the animals after
treatment with HCQ confirmed the therapeutic efficacy of
autophagy inhibition against dormant DTCs, since we repeatedly
observed a significant decrease of the metastatic tumour burden
in mice treated with HCQ following tumour cell injection com-
pared to controls. However, when treatment with HCQ was
delayed for 7 days following cell injections, we no longer observed
significant differences in the metastatic tumour burden of
untreated vs treated mice bearing fibrotic lungs. These data fur-
ther confirmed the insensitivity of proliferating DTCs to autop-
hagy inhibition.
These results were not limited to D2.0 R cells. We observed
that after a short latency period during which the highly meta-
static D2A1 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines were sensitive to HCQ
treatment, the cells were protected from the induction of apop-
totic cell death upon treatment with autophagy inhibitors once

 they began to spontaneously proliferate. These observations were
confirmed in vivo through the demonstration that D2A1 cells
were insensitive to autophagy inhibition once they had undergone
the spontaneous dormant-to-proliferative switch. This was in
sharp contrast with the prominent decrease in metastatic tumour
burden observed in mice treated immediately with HCQ fol-
lowing D2A1 cell injection. Notably, the two cell lines exhibiting a
stable dormant phenotype in our model system, D2.0 R and
MCF78, were sensitive to autophagy inhibition regardless of when
autophagy inhibition was initiated.
The dependence of dormant BC cells on autophagy was further
demonstrated through examination of the autophagic flux in
D2.0 R cells exposed to both non-fibrotic (dormant) and fibrotic
(proliferative) lung environments. We have demonstrated that
autophagy is a critical process during the early phase of metastatic
dissemination of BC cells in both growth restrictive and growth
permissive microenvironments. However, proliferating BC cells
are significantly less sensitive to autophagy inhibition compared
to their dormant counterparts. These data further demonstrate
that disseminated BC cells undergo an initial quiescent phase in
the metastatic colonisation process, which is highly dependent on
autophagy. The duration of the quiescent phase might be variable
depending on multiple factors, among them the metastatic
capacity of the cells and microenvironmental conditions31.
In addition, our results suggest that as quiescent BC cells
transition into a proliferative phase, autophagy is downregulated
and no longer appears critical for their maintenance as other
survival signals likely become activated. This observation might
provide an explanation for the discordant results from clinical
trials addressing the clinical efficacy of autophagy inhibitors in
cancer treatment. Our data suggests that inhibition of autophagy
may primarily affect survival of dormant/quiescent cells prior to
their adaptation to a new metastatic microenvironment. Once
established in their new environment or after proliferation has
been initiated, cells no longer require autophagy and therefore
would not be expected to respond to autophagy inhibition,
resulting in the lack of response in patients diagnosed with either
early stage disease or clinically detectable metastasis. It is also
possible that cells in the primary tumour or proliferating in overt
metastasis use other survival pathways besides autophagy or
following an initial phase of autophagy in which case autophagy
inhibition may not be effective.
A limitation of the model systems used in these studies is that

 or fibrosis is not reversible and that once this occurs, autophagy is
no longer a critical survival pathway. It will be of interest in the
future as more sophisticated dormancy models are developed to
determine whether the autophagy survival pathway is reactivated
if proliferating cells can be induced to enter dormancy. Also,
metastatic disease is the result of the interaction of a myriad of
factors, both tumour autonomous and tumour non-autonomous.
The tumour non-autonomous factors include collagen32, a
property exploited by our in vitro and in vivo model systems8–10,
but also many other molecules and cellular interactions which
contribute to the metastatic process2.
Our data indicate that transcriptional expression of the
autophagy pathway is an early event in dormancy. Interestingly,
we also found that BECN1 expression was unchanged across the
entire dataset as well as the protein level. Although knocking
down the expression of BECN1, a key regulator of autophagy, in
D2.0 R cells did not affect the average metastatic burden in vivo,
knockdown of ATG7 significantly reduced the metastatic capacity
of D2.0 R cells as compared to control cells. These data indicate
that autophagy occurs in dormant D2.0 R cell following a non-
canonical signalling pathway, which is independent of BECN1.
Transcriptomic data of dormant BC cells also revealed the
activation of mitophagy, a selective form of autophagy corre-
sponding to the engulfment and degradation of damaged or
excessive mitochondria24. We observed a striking accumulation
of mitochondrial proteins upon autophagy inhibition, further
suggesting that mitochondria constituted a significant proportion
of the autophagosomal cargo in BC dormant cells. There are three
major pathways involved in mitophagy activation, including the
pathway activated by PINK1 stabilisation in the mitochondrial
outer membrane33. Indeed, we found that dormant BC cells
exhibited an accumulation of the active form of PINK1 at day 5 of
culture on BME matrices. In addition, we have reported a high
degree of co-localisation between LC3 and mitochondrial markers
in dormant BC cells together with a decrease in mitochondrial
membrane potential and an increase in mitochondrial ROS and
mitochondrial mass in dormant BC cells treated with HCQ as
compared with their non-treated counterparts. It is well known
that impaired mitochondria produce a high level of ROS and
consequently, cellular damage34,35. Increased levels of ɣH2Ax and
cCASP3 upon autophagy inhibition in dormant BC cells further
highlighted the relevance of mitochondrial quality control in the
maintenance of quiescent BC cell integrity.
The data from this study provide compelling evidence for the
vital role of autophagy in BC dormancy, in which the clearance of
damaged mitochondria and maintenance of redox homoeostasis
in the early stages of the metastatic colonisation appear to play an
important role. These results suggest that the inclusion of ther-
apeutic approaches to inhibit autophagy as part of the treatment
of primary BC tumours or as an adjuvant therapy might reduce
the dormant tumour cell population responsible for BC recur-
rence and ultimately improve the survival rates of BC patients.
Methods
Cell lines and cell culture. Mouse mammary tumour D2.0 R and D2A1 cells were
derived from spontaneous hyperplastic alveolar nodules13,36 and provided by Ann
Chambers (London Cancer Center, London, Ontario, Canada). MDA-MB-231 and
MCF7 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, HTB-
26 and HTB-22, respectively). The cells were grown in 2D and 3D cultures8.
Briefly, cells grown in 2D were maintained in DMEM high glucose (4.5 g/L glucose,
Gibco, 11965), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. To generate the
3D in vitro systems, the cells were cultured in growth factor–reduced three-
dimensional Cultrex® Basement Membrane Extract (BME) (obtained from Trevi-
gen, Gaithersburg, MDUSA;3432-005-01). Cell culture plates and chamber slides
were coated with 150 μl BME or BME and COL1 per cm2. 1.5 × 104 cells/ml were
resuspended in DMEM low glucose (1 g/L glucose, Gibco, 11885) either supple-
mented with 2% FBS and 2% BME or 2% FBS and BME plus COL1 (2 mg/ml final
COL1 concentration). Cells were cultured on the coated slides at 37 °C and 5% CO2
and re-fed every 5 days. Cultrex® Basement Membrane Extract (BME) (obtained
from Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MDUSA;3432-005-01), is extracted from Engelbreth-
Holm-Swarm (EHS) tumours as a solubilized basement membrane. The extract
primarily contains laminin, collagen IV, entactin, and heparan sulphate pro-
teoglycan. The BME used in these experiments has been processed to minimise
matrix-associated growth factors. It will polymerise to form a basement membrane
matrix hydrogel at 37 °C which provides an extracellular matrix environment for
the 3D in vitro culture conditions used in these studies (https://trevigen.com/
product-category/physiologic-cell-culture/extracellular-matrix-proteins/). D2.0 R
and D2A1 stably expressing GFP were generated via lentiviral infection of the
pSICO construct (provided by Tyler Jacks, Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA). HCQ, 3-MA and Bafilomycin were used as
autophagy inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). MitoTEMPO was used as a mitochondrial
ROS quencher at 20 µM in vitro.
Expression of mCherry-EGFP- LC3 and GFP-LC3 in D2.0 R cells. pBABE ret-
roviral vectors containing mCherry-EGFP- LC3 (Addgene, 22418) or GFP-LC3
(Addgene, 22405) were transfected into PT67 cells (ATCC) using Lipofectamine
3000 (Life Technologies). Retrovirus-containing suspension was collected after 48
h, passed through a 45um filter to obtain viral particles and D2.0 R were transduced
in suspension while spinning at 180×g for 1 h and subsequently selected with
puromycin.
Knockdown of ATG7 and BECN1. TRC lentiviral shRNA constructs targeting
ATG7 (RMM4534-EG74244; Clone IDs: TRCN0000092163, TRCN0000092164,
TRCN0000092165, TRCN0000092166 and TRCN0000092167), BECN1
(RMM4534-EG56208; Clone IDs: TRCN0000087288, TRCN0000087289,
TRCN0000087290, TRCN0000087291 and TRCN0000087292) or scrambled
shRNA (RHS6848) were purchased from Dharmacon. 293 T cells were transfected
with 1ug of shRNA and 1ug of viral packaging plasmids (250ng pMD2.G and 750
ng psPAX2) using 6µl of Xtreme Gene 9 transfection reagent (Roche). After 48 h,
virus-containing supernatant was passed through a 45 µm filter to obtain viral
particles, which were then transferred to 50,000 D2.0 R cells infected in suspension
while spinning at 180×g for 1 h. Finally, 48 h after transduction, the cells were
selected with puromycin and the knockdown verified by western blot.
Cytotoxicity assay. 1.5 × 103 cells were resuspended in 100 μl DMEM (1 g/l glu-
cose; Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% FBS and 2% Cultrex basement membrane
extract (BME) (Trevigen) or 2% FBS and BME plus COL1 (2 mg/ml final COL
concentration), with or without HCQ, and were grown in triplicate in 96-well
plates coated with 50 μl BME or BME plus COL1. The % of dead cells were
measured using the Cytotox-Glo Cytoxocity assay (Promega), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 25 µl of cytotox-Glo reagent was added to each
well, incubated for 10 min and luminescence was read to assess cytotoxicity. For the
assessment of total cell number, 25 µl of lysis reagent was added followed by 10 min
incubation and luminescence read in a Glomax (Promega) microplate
luminometer.
Caspase 3/7 activity assay. Caspase 3/7 activity was performed using the
Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells
were seeded in 3D cultures as described above with or without 20 μM MitoTEMPO
for 5 days. Cells were treated with HCQ at day 5 and assayed after 24 h. Briefly,
plates and reconstituted caspase 3/7 reagent were allowed to equilibrate to room
temperature (RT), reagent was then added to wells at a 1:1 ratio and incubated for
1 h at RT. Luminescence was measured using aGlomax (Promega) microplate
luminometer. Wells with all assay components, except the cells, served as blank
controls.
Proliferation assay. Cells were plated in 3D cultures as described above with or
without HCQ and were grown in triplicate in 96-well plates coated with 50 μl BME
or BME plus COL1. Proliferation was measured using the CellTiter 96® AQueous
One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega), respectively, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 20 µl of CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution
were added to each well, and the absorbance at 490 nm was recorded 2 h later.
BrdU incorporation assay. Proliferation was analysed using the BrdU Cell Pro-
liferation Assay Kit (Cell Signaling Technology,6813) according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. Cells were pulsed with BrdU for 1 h.
Western blot analysis. Protein was extracted from 3D cultures as previously
described37. Western blotting was conducted as previously reported9, with minor
modifications. Briefly, 10 μg of total protein were loaded in NuPAGE™ 4–12%
Bis–Tris Protein Gels (Invitrogen). After separation, proteins were transferred to
PVDF membrane (Millipore). Primary antibodies used were: from Cell Signaling
Technology anti-ATG7 (8558, dilution 1/1000), p62 (5114, dilution 1/1000),
BECN1 (3495, dilution 1/1000), LC3 (12741, dilution 1/1000), CASP3 (9662,
dilution 1/1000), cleaved CASP3 (9661, dilution 1/1000), ɣH2Ax (p139S) (2577,
dilution 1/1000), from Abcam anti-PINK1 (ab75487, dilution 1/500), MTOC-1

Scientific anti-Cyclophillin B (PA1-027A, dilution 1/300), followed by secondary
antibodies (GE Healthcare). Blots were imaged in a ChemiDoc™ Imaging Systems
(Biorad). Uncropped images of western blots are shown in Supplementary Fig-
ures 9 and 10.
Immunofluorescence. Cells were plated in 3D cultures as described above in 24-well
plates with or without HCQ. Well coatings containing the cells were smeared on
permafrost slides and fixed for 10 min with 4% PFA. The cells were washed 10 min
with PBS and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5%Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 10
min, at 4 °C. Permeabilized cells were washed with PBS (3 × 15 min) and blocked
with 10% goat serum for 1 h and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody.
Slides were incubated with anti-LAMP1 from Novus Biologicals (NBP2-25154) and
from Cell Signaling Technology anti-LC3 (CST, 12741), Ki67 (CST 9449) or cleaved
CASP3 (CST, 9661) in 5% BSA and Tris-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-
T) at 4 °C overnight. Later, the slides were incubated with either Alexa fluor 488 goat
anti-rabbit and Alexa fluor 568 goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies or Alexa fluor
488 goat anti-mouse and Alexa fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen) for 1 h,
mounted with Vectashield mounting medium with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) and imaged using a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope.
Live cell imaging. Cells were plated in 3D cultures as described above in µ-slides
(Ibidi) with or without HCQ. Prior to the observation of the cultures, the cells were
incubated with 500 nM MitoTracker Red CMXRos (M7512, Invitrogen) and/or
Hoechst 33342 (R37605, Invitrogen) and subsequently imaged using a Zeiss LSM
780 confocal microscope.
Digital image acquisition and processing. Digital images were acquired using: (1)
an inverted microscope EVOS FL auto (Thermo Fisher Scientific); (2) confocal
images of 3D cultures were taken using Zeiss LSM-780 confocal system for which
acquisition was performed using Zeiss LSM software ZEN. Images were composed
and edited in ZEN or Photoshop CC (Adobe) software, in which background was
reduced using brightness and contrast adjustments applied to the whole image. Co-
localisation of GFP-LC3 and MitoTracker RedCMXRos was determined using a
ZEN automated macro pipeline calculating double-positive pixels.
Flow cytometry analysis. To isolate mCherry-GFP-LC3 D2.0 R cells, the lungs
were mechanically disaggregated (gentleMACS, Miltenyl Biotec) and filtered
through 40 µm and 10 µm cell strainers. Cells isolated from BME matrices37 were
stained using 100 nM MitoTracker Green FM (M7514), mitochondrial ROS using 5
μM MitoSox (M36008) and mitochondrial membrane potential using 250 nM
TMRM (T-668), following the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). Prior to FACS,
cells were stained with Pacific blue (Invitrogen) to discriminate live and dead cells
and directly analysed without fixing. Data acquisition of the stained cells was per-
formed on LSR–Fortessa cytometer and the analysis was performed on FlowJo
software. Autophagic flux was determined by plotting the ratio of mCherry:EGFP in
D2.0 R stably expressing the tandem reporter mCherry-GFP-LC3. To define low
and high autophagic flux cell populations we performed a preliminary study in
which we subjected D2.0 R mCherry-GFP-LC3 cells to starvation conditions (cells
cultured in or DMEM 2 g/dL glucose + 2% FBS) while in culture for 6 days. We
used these cells as an autophagy positive control and compared the resulting
mCherry:EGFP ratio to that obtained from D2.0 R mCherry-GFP-LC3 cells grown
in complete media (DMEM 4.5 g/dL glucose + 10% FBS) for 6 days. Starved D2.0 R
mCherry-GFP-LC3 cells showed a higher mCherry:EGFP ratio as compared to non-
starved D2.0 R mCherry-GFP-LC3 cells (Supplementary Fig. 7c). These cell popu-
lations were defined as high autophagic flux and low autophagic flux D2.0 R
mCherry-GFP-LC3 cells and the analysis settings used in this experiment were later
applied to analyse the flow cytometry data from D2.0 R mCherry-GFP-LC3 cells
isolated from mouse lungs in the experiment reported in Fig. 4f of the main text.
Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values were normalised to the mitochondrial
mass of the cells and calculated to determine the percentage of mitochondrial ROS
and the percentage of mitochondrial membrane potential. To do that, we calculated
the MFI ratio of Mitosox or TMRM to Mitotracker Green in order to obtain
normalised MFI values for mitochondrial ROS and mitochondrial membrane
potential, respectively. Values were expressed as a percentage of positively stained
cells out of the entire cell population analysed.
RNAseq and bioinformatics analysis. Cells were isolated from the 3D matrices37.
Briefly, culture matrices were incubated with 2 ml of ice cold DPBS, 5 mM EDTA
solution at 4 °C in agitation for 60 min. Solubilized culture matrices and cells were
transferred to a tube and spun at 3200 xg, 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatant was dis-
carded and pellets resuspended in 10 ml of ice cold DPBS, 5 mM EDTA solution.
Resuspended cells were spun at 1700×g 4 °C for 15 min. This step was repeated
twice or until the cell pellets were visible. Following cell extraction from the
matrices, RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) following the manu-
facturer’s instructions. The quality and quantity of extracted total RNA was assessed
using TapeStation 2200 (Agilent). All RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses were
performed using three biological replicates. Library preparation was performed
using the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina with
NEBNext multiplexing oligos using the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA sequencing
was conducted on the Illumina HiSeq 2500. Aligned reads (BAM files) were ana-
lysed using PartekFlow software for differential expression and gene enrichment
analysis. Comparisons used Partek Gene Specific Analysis (GSA) algorithm and
multiple comparisons were corrected using false discovery rate (FDR), which was set
at 0.05. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was applied to differentially expressed gene sets
to identify the pathways that changed across the dataset.
Animal studies. Study approval: All animals were treated in accordance with the
guidelines of the Animal Care and Use of Laboratory animals (NIH publication no.
86–23, 1985) under the protocol LCBG-033 approved by the IACUC of the
National Cancer Institute (NCI).
Pulmonary fibrosis: Pulmonary fibrosis was induced in 8-week-old female
CD1nu/nu athymic mice (Charles River Laboratories)38. Mice received 5 × 108 PFU
of adenoviral vector expressing either active TGFβ1 (Ad-TGFβ1223/225) to induce
fibrosis or adenovirus-null vector control (Ad-empty) in 20 μl PBS to the lungs
through nasal instillation.
Experimental metastasis assay: 21 days after infection, 1 × 106 D2.0R-GFP cells
were tail vein injected into CD1nu/nu athymic mice. Alternatively, 1 × 106 sh-SCR,
sh-BECN1 (shRNA 1 and 3) and sh-ATG7 (shRNA 4 and 5) D2.0R-GFP cells,
mCherry-EGFP-LC3 D2.0 R cells or D2A1-GFP cells were tail vein injected into
CD1nu/nu athymic mice that did not receive adenovirus.
In vivo treatment: Autophagy was blocked in CDnu/nu athymic mice by
injecting 50 mg per Kg of body weight of HCQ or vehicle (PBS) i.p. 5 days a week
for 3 weeks.
Lung imaging: At the experimental endpoint, mice were killed, their lungs
extracted, perfused with PBS and imaged by fluorescent single cell organ
microscopy (SCOM) imaging (EVOS FL Auto, Thermo Fisher Scientific)9. Images
of the total surface of the lungs were captured at ×10 magnification and analysed
using ImageJ software (NIH).
Statistics. In vitro experiments were repeated at least 3 times with 3 technical
replicates each with representative images, blots and histograms shown. All data are
represented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM; represented as error
bars in the graphs). Shapiro-Wilks test was used to assess data normality and,
according to the results, a parametric or a non-parametric test was chosen, as
specified in the Fig. legends. P ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Details of the
statistical analyses of metastatic lesion measurements by SCOM9 are as follows.
Pixel counts of GFP-positive metastatic lung lesions were quantified for the entire
surface area of each lung. Lesions with >10 and <1000 pixels2 represented individual
tumour cells; lesions with >1000 pixels2 represented multicellular metastatic lesions.
Total tumour burden/lung was represented by the total number of pixels2 detected
on the entire surface of each lung. Average tumour burden/lung was represented as
the mean size of the metastatic lesions. Statistical analyses of differences in the
distribution of tumour burden between groups utilised Mann–Whitney U-test for
pairwise comparisons and Kruskal–Wallis test for multiple group comparisons with
Dunn’s correction. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.

been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) and are accessible through the GEO Series accession
number GSE112094. All other relevant data are available from the corresponding
