The host cell factor cyclophilin A (CypA) interacts directly with the HIV-1 capsid and
regulates viral infectivity. Although the crystal structure of CypA in complex with the
N-terminal domain of the HIV-1 capsid protein (CA) has been known for nearly two decades,
how CypA interacts with the viral capsid and modulates HIV-1 infectivity remains unclear. We
determined the cryoEM structure of CypA in complex with the assembled HIV-1 capsid at 8-Å
resolution. The structure exhibits a distinct CypA-binding pattern in which CypA selectively
bridges the two CA hexamers along the direction of highest curvature. EM-guided all-atom
molecular dynamics simulations and solid-state NMR further reveal that the CypA-binding
pattern is achieved by single-CypA molecules simultaneously interacting with two CA sub-
units, in different hexamers, through a previously uncharacterized non-canonical interface.
These results provide new insights into how CypA stabilizes the HIV-1 capsid and is recruited
to facilitate HIV-1 infection.

nfection by retroviruses, including HIV-1, is critically depen-
dent on the functions of the viral capsid1–3, which plays
multiple roles during replication, including the prevention of
innate sensor triggering4,5 and regulation of reverse transcrip-
tion1,6
and
nuclear
import7–9.
Such
functions
are
highly
dependent on interactions between the viral capsid and cellular
factors. The host cell protein cyclophilin A (CypA) binds directly
to the HIV-1 capsid and modulates capsid uncoating and
viral infectivity10–12. Interference with CypA-binding inhibits
HIV-1 replication in cell culture13–15. In addition, host cell
proteins containing the CypA domain, including Trim-Cyp and
Nup358, interact directly with the viral capsid and control HIV-1
infection8,16,17.
CypA-binding appears to stabilize or destabilize the HIV-1
capsid, depending on the cell type6,18. In addition, the interaction
between CypA and HIV-1 CA promotes HIV-1 infection of
human
cells19,20,
yet,
in
non-human
primates,
the
same
interaction enhances the anti-HIV-1 restriction activity of
Trim5a (refs 21–23). Furthermore, while CypA promotes HIV-
1 reverse transcription in human cells, its cell-type specific effect
is best correlated with nuclear entry, and probably involves an
unknown CypA-dependent host restriction factor24. Owing to
this complexity, understanding the role of CypA in HIV-1
infection has been difficult, especially given the limited structural
information that is available.
The crystal structure of CypA in complex with the CA
N-terminal domain (CANTD) shows that CA residues A88-G89-
P90 and the configuration of the CypA-binding loop are
important for the binding interaction11. Binding of CypA to the
CypA-binding loop of the viral capsid is essential for viral
infectivity25,26, as substitutions in loop residues G89 or P90 in
HIV-1 CA are deleterious to replication14,21,27. CypA binding to
monomeric CA can be detected at high protein concentration11,
but binding is enhanced by CA multimerization10, suggesting that
CypA favours binding to an assembled capsid. Despite extensive
studies on the interaction between CypA and HIV-1 CA, struc-
tural information on how CypA interacts with the assembled viral
capsid, and an understanding of the consequences of the
interaction for capsid function, are lacking.
To elucidate the molecular interactions between CypA and the
HIV-1 capsid, we determined the structure of CypA in complex
with an HIV-1 CA tubular assembly at 8-Å resolution by cryoEM.
The density map, combined with structure-guided molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations, unexpectedly revealed a novel, non-
canonical, second capsid-binding site on CypA that is vital for
stabilizing the viral capsid. The finding was confirmed experi-
mentally by solid-state NMR.
Results
Binding of CypA to wild-type (wt) CA assemblies. We began
our studies by characterizing the binding of CypA to HIV-1 CA
tubular assemblies at various CypA:CA molar ratios. Binding was
measured in a high-speed centrifugation assay, after incubation of
CypA with a fixed concentration of pre-assembled wild-type (wt)
CA tubes. Incubation of CypA with CA tubes, up to a 6:6 molar
ratio, resulted in co-sedimentation of CypA and CA (Fig. 1a, top),
with the CypA:CA binding ratio increasing as the CypA con-
centration increased, up to 40 mM, beyond which point, binding
was saturated (Fig. 1b, solid line). Interestingly, while a relatively
low amount of CypA (CypA:CA input ratios r 2:6) slightly
enhanced the amount of CA in the pelleted fraction (Fig. 1a top),
CypA:CA ratios above 2:6 led to a reduction in the amount of
pelleted CA (Fig. 1a, top). This finding is consistent with an
earlier report that high molar ratios of CypA:CA alter CA
assembly in vitro28.
We also tested the effect of CypA on the process of CA
assembly by including it in the CA assembly reaction under the
high-salt condition (2.25 M NaCl) (Fig. 1a, bottom). In this case,
CypA binding was consistently higher compared with when it
was added to pre-assembled CA tubes (Fig. 1b, dotted lines).
However, the presence of CypA during CA assembly induced
marked morphological changes in the resulting CA assemblies
(Fig. 1c): in the absence of CypA, long CA tubes were formed; at
an intermediate level of CypA, short tubes and cones were
generated; and, at high CypA concentrations (6:6 CypA:CA molar
ratio input), very small cones and spheres were observed,
indicating a significant increase in the curvature of the assemblies.
These data suggest that CypA influences the curvature of CA
assemblies possibly by preferentially binding to and stabilizing
CA assembly conformations with a high degree of curvature, a
distinctive feature that had not been previously appreciated but
can be clearly explained by the structure presented here (further
sections). This influence of CypA on the capsid curvature may
shed new light on the maturation process, since CypA is packaged
into viral particles and may facilitate the formation of cones by
stablizing a high degree of curvature at the ends during
maturation. Similar to the pre-assembled tubes, CA was reduced
in the pelleted fraction with higher CypA:CA molar ratios in the
co-assembly reaction (Fig. 1a).
CypA affects the stiffness of CA assemblies. To determine the
effect of CypA on CA stability, we used atomic force microscopy
(AFM) operated in the nano-indentation mode to measure the
stiffness of wt CA assemblies as a function of CypA level. The
point stiffness measured for CA without CypA was 0.043±
0.006 N m � 1 (n ¼ 30) (Fig. 1d). A gradual elevation in CypA level
resulted in an increase in CA stiffness (1:6 CypA:CA ratio
is 0.11±0.02 N m � 1 (n ¼ 31) and 3:6 is 0.14±0.018 N m � 1
(n ¼ 24)). The stiffness value represents the amount of force that
is required to deform the CA structure or, alternatively, the ability
of the structure to withstand an external force. In the case of a CA
assembly, this ability is governed by the interaction strength
between its building blocks, namely, CA hexamers. Thus, higher
stiffness values represent stronger interactions between the
building blocks of the CA lattice. Incorporation of CypA into the
CA structure increased the effective interaction strength between
the CA hexamers. This effect was maximal at a 3:6 CypA:CA
ratio. Interestingly, further addition of CypA to a 6:6 ratio
reduced the stiffness of CA by almost twofold (0.088±
0.011 N m � 1 (n ¼ 45)), compared with the stiffness obtained at a
3:6 ratio. However, the CA stiffness at 6:6 remains significantly
larger than CA lacking CypA. These results suggest that CypA
incorporation in the capsid structure strengthens the stability of
capsid in a stoichiometrically dependent manner, with the effi-
ciency of this effect being notably decreased at high (6:6) CypA to
CA molar ratios.
CryoEM structure of CypA-CA tubular complex. To determine
the structure of the CypA-CA tubular assembly complex, we
chose the CypA-CA ratio and assembly conditions that yielded
homogeneous complexes suitable for cryoEM: pre-assembled CA
tubes with CypA added at 2:6 CypA:CA molar ratio (Fig. 1a top).
Addition of CypA resulted in well-separated, long helical tubes
with a layer of density decorating the CA tube surface (Fig. 2a,
inset, black arrows). Such tubes are well-ordered to at least 13.8-Å
resolution, as indicated by the Fourier transform (Fig. 2b).
We carried out three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the
CypA-CA tubular complex using the iterative real-space helical
reconstruction method29. Combining 19 high-resolution tubes
belonging to a single helical symmetry of ( � 8, 13) (see ref. 29 for

 information regarding helical symmetry), we determined the
cryoEM structure of the CypA-CA tubular complex at 8-Å
resolution, as indicated by the Fourier shell correlation of 0.5
(Supplementary Fig. 1).
The resulting density map displays a number of intriguing
features. First, among the three CA helical arrays in the assembly
(Fig. 2c; dashed black arrows denote the three directions along
which helical tubular arrays are formed, each direction corre-
sponding to a different curvature), CypA binds preferentially
along the most highly curved array (Fig. 2c, Supplementary
Fig. 2a). Very little CypA binds to the CA arrays that run in the
other two helical directions. The same binding preference was
observed in an independent reconstruction generated from tubes
with a very different helical symmetry ( � 12, 11) (Supplementary
Fig. 2b). Such selective binding explains the sub-stoichiometric
binding ratios observed in our CypA-binding assays (Fig. 1b).
Second, while the CA region is highly ordered and all the
a-helices are well resolved (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 1b,c), the
resolution at the CypA region is poorer (Fig. 2e, Supplementary
Fig. 1b,c). This could be because of the known flexibility of the
CypA-binding loop11,30, which would give rise to variable CypA
orientations, and/or to partial occupancy by the CypA molecule.
Indeed, when individual images were aligned based on the CA
density (Supplementary Fig. 1a), the resolution for the CA region
was improved, but the density corresponding to the CypA
molecule became less well-defined (Supplementary Fig. 1b,c).
Third, rigid body docking of the hexamer model (PDB: 3J4F)
derived from our previous study30 showed a near-perfect fit into
the CA density (Fig. 2d), with a cross-correlation coefficient
(CCC) of 0.84 between the atomic models of the hexamer and the
density map, suggesting that CypA binding to a pre-assembled
tube has little effect on the overall structure of the CA hexamer.
Finally, aligning the CANTD from the crystal structure of the
CypA-CANTD complex (PDB: 1AK4) (ref. 11) with the CANTD in
our rigid body fitted model (3J4F) places the CypA model exactly
into the CypA density region (Fig. 2e). Most interestingly, the
CypA density appears to bridge two neighbouring CA hexamers
and is located directly above the CACTD dimer interface (Fig. 2e)
of two adjacent, non-CypA-binding CA molecules (Fig. 2c–e;
Fig. 3e, red CA molecules).
An initial interpretation may be that the bridging density
corresponds to a CypA dimer, with each CypA molecule binding
to the CypA-binding loop from the adjacent CA hexamer.
However, there is not enough space to accommodate two CypA
molecules without extensive clashing. In addition, analytical
centrifugation experiments suggest that CypA is primarily
monomeric in our experimental conditions (Supplementary
Fig. 3). Furthermore, focused classification using reference-based
cross-correlation to separate CypA-binding modes into distinct
classes, resulted in class averages that contain monomeric CypA
bound to CA hexamers (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Thus, the
bridging density likely corresponds to a single-CypA molecule, in
which case, one may ask why CypA only occupies one particular
helical array, rather than being equally distributed along all
directions. One possibility is that a single CypA interacts with two
CA molecules that are arranged in a specific geometry, with each
CA molecule recognizing a different region of the enzyme.
Supporting evidence for this idea comes from two sources: (1) a
crystal structure of the CypA/CsA complex (PDB: 2RMA), in
which the opposite faces of CypA each bind a molecule of CsA
(ref. 31); and (2) an analysis of the inhibition of CypA-Gag
interaction by CsA, showing a sigmoidal CsA inhibition curve,
indicating synergy between two CsA in the inhibition12. For these
reasons, we suggest that a single-CypA molecule spans two CA
hexamers in the tubular complex (Fig. 2e).
Computational modelling of the CypA-CA lattice. For the
binding of a single-CypA molecule to two adjacent CA hexamers
in a helical array, two binding modes are possible: (1) CypA binds
more strongly to the left hexamer, extending across to the right
one; or (2) CypA binds the other way around. The density map is

 an ensemble average of all possible binding modes from many
tubes and, thus, cannot distinguish between the binding modes.
Therefore, we carried out MD flexible fitting (MDFF) to model
the interaction between CypA and the CA tubes (simulations
1and 2—Supplementary Table 1), monitoring, during the simu-
lation, the cross-correlation between the model and the experi-
mental density (Supplementary Fig. 4). An ensemble of 10 fully
saturated CypA-CA tubular complex models (Fig. 3a) was con-
structed as described in Supplementary Information. Overlapping
or clashing CypA molecules were removed with no bias from the
saturated models, resulting in 10 tubular complex models with
thousands of statistically independent arrangements of CypA
over the CA lattice (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Interestingly, in all
cases, clashes between CypA and adjacent CA molecules were
only observed along the least curved helical direction of the tube
(a typical HIV tube contains a CA lattice with three helical
directions along which repeating arrays are found, each direction
with different characteristic curvatures as illustrated in Fig. 2c and
Supplementary Fig. 6), resulting in removal of CypA molecules
along this direction (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Subsequently, the
CypA-CA tubular complex models were equilibrated for 100 ns
(Supplementary Fig. 7, simulation 2—Supplementary Table 1),
and simulated electron density maps were generated for each
model (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Mimicking the cryoEM real-
space helical reconstruction process, a final, averaged density map
with helical symmetry imposed was calculated from all these
models.
The resulting average density map (Fig. 3b) matches the
experimental map remarkably well, especially the selectivity of
CypA for the most curved CA lattice array, with a cross-
correlation value of 0.967 (Figs 2c and 3b). During the course of
the MD simulations (simulation 2), the CA lattices remained
rigid, as previously reported30, whereas the CypA-binding loops
and the CypA molecules exhibited a range of motions (as calcu-
lated from root-mean-square fluctuations of the atomic positions,
mapped onto the structure of the tube in Supplementary Fig. 8),
which can be considered a likely cause for the lower resolution
of the cryoEM density map at the CypA region (Supplementary
Fig. 1b,c). Indeed, principal component analysis of longer trajec-
tories of CypA-CA subsystems extracted from the MDFF-derived

 tube (simulations 4 and 6, Supplementary Fig. 9), revealed two
distinct types of motion depending on whether CypA is bridging
along the most curved CA array or not (Fig. 3c,d). Although the
bridging CypA exhibits limited motion (1�) perpendicular to the
array direction and appears locked onto the curved CA lattice
(Fig. 3c), disjointed CypA is more mobile (20�) and inter-
converts between the two conformers observed in the crystal
structure of the CypA-CANTD complex (Fig. 3d, Supplementary
Movie 1)11.
To investigate the detailed interactions between CypA and CA,
a subsystem comprising two adjacent CA subunits with a
corresponding bridging CypA (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Table 1
and Supplementary Movie 2). The MD simulation revealed,
beside the first binding interface at the canonical CypA-binding
site, a second binding interface between CypA and CA,
comprising residues A88, G89 and P90 from CA, and A25, P29
and K30 from CypA (Fig. 3f, site 2). The interaction at the
second, non-canonical CypA-binding site is weaker than at the
canonical binding site, as shown from pair interaction energies
� 16.1±7.3 and � 28.9±17.0 kcal mol � 1, respectively, obtained
from unrestrained CypA simulations (simulation 4—Supple-
mentary Table 1). However, the second site, properly positioned,
could yield a strong binding avidity once CypA binds to the first
CA through the canonical site. Interestingly, a similar second
binding site, involving P29 and K30 on CypA, was observed in an
early crystal structure of the CypA/CsA complex (PDB: 2RMA),
in which two CsA molecules bind CypA (Fig. 3g)31. We conclude,
therefore, that CypA likely employs both binding sites to
strengthen the CA dimer interface in the CA assembly, thereby
stabilizing the viral capsid.
Solid-state NMR spectroscopy. To experimentally delineate the
CA and CypA residues that form the intermolecular CypA-CA
interface, we employed magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR
spectroscopy. We previously showed that CA tubular assemblies
yield unprecedented high-resolution MAS NMR spectra, per-
mitting their in-depth characterization32. In complex with
CypA, multiple chemical shift perturbations were detected in
the two-dimensional (2D) COmbined R2-Symmetry Driven and
NCACX spectra from isotopically labelled CA (U-13C,15N)
tubular
assemblies
(Fig.
4a,
Supplementary
Fig.
10).
The
perturbed resonances belong mostly to residues in the CypA-
binding loop (Fig. 4b), in agreement with the cryoEM results.
Additional perturbations, observed for a few residues located in
other CA regions (Fig. 4b), are likely due to allosteric effects. Our
recent study revealed that binding of CypA to tubular assemblies
of CA results in significantly attenuated mobility of CypA loop
and other CA regions33.
To infer the CypA residues that interact with the assembled
CA, we prepared isotopically labelled CypA (U-13C,15N) with
assembled CA tubes at three different CypA:CA input ratios of
1:4, 1:2 and 1:1, and recorded CORD and NCA spectra (Fig. 4c,
Supplementary Fig. 10). Numerous chemical shift perturbations
and/or intensity changes were observed as the CypA:CA ratio
increased (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Table 2). Many of the spectral
changes correspond to the CypA residues comprising the
canonical binding site. In addition, we observed many residues,
not associated with the canonical binding site, that experience
spectral changes. Mapping these residues onto the CypA structure
reveals that many are located at or in the vicinity of the non-
canonical second binding site (Fig. 4d), consistent with the results
of cryoEM and MD simulations. Interestingly, at a CypA:CA ratio
of 6:6, additional spectral perturbations are found in residues
distal to either the canonical or the non-canonical binding site
(Fig. 4d). These perturbations are likely due to allosteric effects at
high CypA concentrations rather than direct interactions with
CA. We note that the NMR experiments were run for co-

 assembled samples (Fig. 1a–c). The observed enhanced binding
(not saturated at sub-stoichiometric conditions) in these highly
curved assemblies (as opposed to the tubular assemblies) is
consistent with our model that one CypA binds the CA hexamer
along the curved direction of CA tubes. The MAS NMR results
corroborate the cryoEM findings and computer simulations,
revealing that CypA binds to assembled CA through canonical
and non-canonical binding sites.
Discussion
A significant result from this study is the discovery of a non-
canonical, second site of CypA for binding to the assembled CA
lattice. Through this site, CypA bridges two CA molecules from
adjacent hexamers, thus stabilizing the CA lattice (Fig. 1a). The
additional interaction interface that is established by the new site
further strengthens the binding of CypA to the CA lattice through
avidity. CypA is known to have different effects on viral
infectivity in different host cells; some are enhancive while others
are restrictive24. Whether these effects correlate with CypA’s
cellular expression level or are associated with an unknown cell-
specific cellular factor is still not clear. The fact that CypA, via its
second binding site, binds selectively along the most curved CA
array (Fig. 2c) and promotes curved assembly (Fig. 1c), further
implies that CypA and proteins containing CypA domains are
best suited to interact with a conical capsid exhibiting a
continuous curvature.
We found that sub-stoichiometric amounts of CypA (up to
3:6 CypA:CA) stabilize the CA assembly (Fig. 1d). On the other
hand, a high level of CypA reduces capsid stability (Fig. 1d) and
disrupts the capsid assembly (Fig. 1a)28. These seemingly
contradictory observations can be explained by steric hindrance

 between two CypA molecules upon simultaneous binding to
neighbouring CA hexamers, thus weakening, at high concen-
tration, the dimer assembly interface. This effect is utilized by
the host restriction factors Trim-Cyp and Trim5a to carry out
their function34–36; both proteins contain stable dimeric capsid-
binding motifs, CC-Cyp and CC-SPRY, in addition to the B-box
domain for higher-order oligomerization, to enhance the affinity
of interaction through avidity effects37. The CC-SPRY dimer,
not the SPRY monomer, effectively binds to and breaks the capsid
between CA hexamers38,39. Our data further suggest a plausible
mechanism for Trim-mediated premature uncoating and viral
restriction that involves direct binding of Trim-Cyp and Trim5a
at the inter-hexamer interface and subsequent destabilization
of the viral capsid37,40,41. Since CypA prefers curvature and
stabilizes curved assemblies, the variable curvature in the mature
core would help CypA binding. CypA binding may also have a
greater effect on a continuously curved capsid. CypA binding
to the HIV-1 capsid
also enhances the antiviral activity
of some small molecule inhibitors, such as PF74 (ref. 42). Based
on our observation that CypA binding hardens the capsid lattice,
in our AFM experiments, we suggest that PF74, which appears to
act at the uncoating step of infection, acts more effectively on
CypA-stabilized capsid.
What are the functional consequences of CypA binding to the
HIV-1 core? Lentiviruses, such as HIV-1, are differentiated from
other retroviruses by having evolved the ability to traverse the
nuclear pore complex, allowing replication in non-dividing cells.
HIV-1 has been suggested to use CypA and CPSF6 to cloak
its genome during migration through the cytoplasm, allowing
evasion of innate immune sensing in primary human macro-
phages and dendritic cells4,5,43,44. Our data support this notion
and suggest that the second interaction interface is important for
the protective role of CypA to the viral capsid. On the basis of
previous studies by others8 and our current results, we propose a
simplified model for the function of CypA in HIV-1 infection
(Fig. 5). In permissive cells, CypA affects HIV-1 transduction in
two stages. The first stage is within the cytoplasm during reverse
transcription. Since a single CypA bridges two CA molecules
from adjacent hexamers, a sub-stoichiometric level of CypA
stabilizes the capsid and protects the viral core from premature
uncoating, thus promoting reverse transcription in all cell types34.
At the second stage, once the HIV-1 core reaches the nuclear
membrane, the CA subunits that are not bound by CypA could be
available for binding to Nup358 (ref. 24), thus facilitating HIV-1
infection by coordinating proper uncoating of the core in target
cells6,45. On the other hand, a high level of CypA binding or
addition of Trim-Cyp/Trim5a could destabilize the capsid18,46,47;
CypA enhances Trim-mediated restriction at a stage after reverse
transcription in restrictive cells48, and productive restriction can
occur even when a fraction of CA in the capsid is available
for Trim-Cyp binding49. Taken together, our results provide new
insights into how CypA engages in modulating HIV-1 infectivity.
In
summary,
we
used
an
integrative
multi-disciplinary
approach, combining cryoEM, computer modelling and MD
simulations, solid-state NMR and biochemical analysis, to
investigate the interactions between the host cell factor CypA
and HIV-1 capsid assembly. We uncovered a novel interaction
interface of CypA which may provide a new avenue for the
development of therapeutic interventions that target CypA
interactions with the HIV-1 capsid.
Methods
Protein expression and purification (CA-FL and CypA). Recombinant wt HIV-1
CA (HXB2) and CypA proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, Rosetta 2 (DE3),
cultured in Luria-Bertani media or modified minimal medium, and induced with
0.4 mM IPTG at 23 �C for 16 h (refs 50,51). Natural abundance and U-13C, 15N
isotopically labelled CA proteins were purified over a 5 ml Hi-Trap QP column
(GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) in 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0),
1 mM DTT and 0.02% sodium azide, followed by a 5 ml Hi-Trap SP columns
(GE Healthcare) using a 0.1 M NaCl gradient in a 25 mM sodium phosphate
(pH 5.8), 1 mM DTT and 0.02% sodium azide mixture. The final purification
step comprised gel-filtration over Hi-Load Superdex 200 16/60 columns
(GE Healthcare) in 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT
and 0.02% sodium azide. Proteins were concentrated to 10 mg ml � 1 using Amicon
concentrators (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), flash-frozen with liquid N2, and
stored at � 80 �C. Cells expressing unlabelled and U-13C, 15N isotopically labelled
CypA were lysed using sonication in 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0,
and centrifuged at 15,000 r.p.m. at 4 �C for 1 h. After adjusting the pH to 5.5 with
acetic acid, the solution was centrifuged again at 15,000 r.p.m. at 4 �C for 1 h, and
the supernatant was loaded onto a 5 ml HiTrap SP HP (GE Healthcare) column
and eluted with a 0–1 M NaCl gradient. Fractions containing the target protein
were combined and further purified with a Hi-Load Superdex 75 pg 26/600
(GE Healthcare) column in a buffer containing 25 mM sodium phosphate,
1 mM DTT and 0.02% NaN3, pH 5.5.
CA assembly and CypA-binding assays. For CA and CypA co-assembly, 80 mM
(2 mg ml � 1) wt CA was mixed with CypA at different molar ratios in a buffer
containing 2.25 M NaCl and 50 mM Tris-Hcl (pH 8.0) and incubated at 37 �C for
1 h. For CypA binding to pre-assembled CA tubes, 10 mg ml � 1 wt CA was first
diluted to 2 mg ml � 1 in a buffer containing 1 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0 and

cells, either high levels of CypA or CypA in combination with host restriction factors such as Trim5a and Trim-Cyp facilitate premature uncoating and
result in viral restriction.

 incubated at 37 �C for 1 h. The assembly mixture was then incubated with CypA at
different molar ratios at room temperature for 2 h. At the end of incubation, 5 ml
samples were immediately used for cryoEM analysis. An amount of 6 ml samples
from the same reaction mixtures were mixed with 4 � LDS loading buffer (Invi-
trogen, NP-0007) supplemented with 10 mM DTT for SDS–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) analysis (t). The remaining sample was pelleted at
20,000g with an Eppendorf centrifuge 5417R for 15 min, and supernatants (s) and
resuspended pellets (p) were mixed with 4 � LDS loading buffer for gel analysis.
Total, supernatant and pellet samples, without boiling, were fractionated on 10%
SDS–PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Each experiment was carried out at
least three times.
To determine the binding ratio of CypA:CA, the SDS–PAGE gels were scanned
using an Epson 4990 scanner. The integrated intensities of CA and CypA protein
bands were measured using Image J 1.40 program (NIH). The molar ratios were
calculated according to the formula (CypA intensity/CypA molecular weight)/(CA
intensity/CA molecular weight) and calibrated using the input ratios as standards.
AFM indentation experiments. For AFM measurements, 160 mM wt CA was
dialysed against a high-salt buffer (50 mM Tris-Hcl pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl) overnight at
4 �C. The assembled protein was diluted to 80 mM and incubated with varying
concentrations of CypA (13, 40 and 80 mM) for 2 h at 4 �C. CA assemblies were
attached to hexamethyldisilazane-coated microscope glass slides using previously
described methods52,53. All measurements were conducted in a fluid environment
(high-salt buffer). The experimental system consisted of a Nanowizard ULTRA
Speed atomic force microscope (JPK, Berlin, Germany) mounted on an inverted
optical microscope (AxioObserver, Carl Zeiss, Heidelberg, Germany). Images of
capsid particles were acquired in AFM tapping mode. Silicon nitride probes (DNP,
k ¼ 0.1±0.01 N m � 1, Bruker) were used, their spring constants being determined
experimentally by measuring the thermal fluctuations of the cantilevers (Hutter
and Bechhoefer, 1993). To determine the stiffness of an individual capsid, an
indentation experiment was performed. For each capsid, B100 successive force-
distance curves were collected at a scan rate of 20 Hz. To maintain a constant
range of indentation depths, the maximal loading force was limited to a range of
0.2–1.5 nN, yielding maximal indentation depths of 4 nm. Capsid stiffness was
calculated from the slope of the force-distance curve, according to Hooke’s law, on
the assumption that the capsid and the cantilever can be modelled as two springs
arranged in series.
CryoEM specimen preparation and data collection. Full-length wt CA
(10 mg ml � 1) was diluted to 2 mg ml � 1 in high-salt buffer (1 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris
pH 8.0) at 37 �C for 1 h for tubular assembly. The assembly mixture was then
incubated with CypA (27 mM) at room temperature for 2 h. CryoEM grids
were prepared according to the procedure described previously30. Low-dose
(B15 e � Å � 2) projection images were collected with a Tecnai TF20 microscope
(FEI Corp., OR) operated at 200 kV, on Kodak SO163 films at a nominal
magnification of 55,000, with under-focus values ranging from 1.0 to 3.5 mm.
The best micrographs were selected and digitized using a Nikon super coolscan
9000 ED scanner (Nikon, Japan) at an optical resolution of 4,000 d.p.i.
3D EM reconstruction. More than 800 films of tube images possessing a wide
range of diameters and helical symmetries were collected. Nineteen tubes with
( � 8, 13) symmetry were selected and boxed into segments of size 512 � 512 pixels
with a shift of two subunits along the helical axis by the EMAN BOXER program
(ref. 54). The defocus value of each micrograph was evaluated using the program
CTFFIND3 (ref. 55). An initial density map was reconstructed from binned
segments of 256 � 256 pixels using iterative helical real-space reconstruction29. The
refined helical parameters corresponded to a rise of 7.393 Å and a rotation angle of
138.13�. The preliminary map was further refined using iterative helical real-space
reconstruction without binning. During the refinement, helical symmetry and
full-contrast transfer function (CTF) correction were applied. A total of 8,640
helical segments, containing 17,280 asymmetric units, were included in the final
reconstruction. The Fourier shell correlation curve was calculated using gold
standard procedure from two independent half data sets.
Focused classification. To accurately assess a given CypA-CA binding site for
CypA occupancy, reference-based classification was used. Owing to the very large
mass discrepancy between the rest of the CypA-CA tube and an individual CypA
monomer or dimer, very accurate background subtraction was needed, essentially
as described in ref. 56.
References were generated by simulating electron density maps for CypA from
the CypA-CANTD crystal structure (PDB: 1AK4) filtered to 12 Å using Chimera57.
These were then aligned to the final EM map in three binding modes: CypA
monomer binding to the left hexamer; CypA monomer binding to the right
hexamer; CypA composite dimer (referred to as CypA dimer hereon) binding to
both, with steric clashes present. In addition, we included a negative control with
a CypA dimer positioned above the centre of the CA hexamer in question; any
significant density showing up in the results would indicate a bias selecting
for noise. The cross-correlation between each of these four references was
calculated for each particle, in replicates of three as described in the following.
To account for the large difference in signal-to-noise ratio between the
re-projections from the final model and its individual data projections, we added
noise and information from the particle’s CTF for each comparison. Three
hundred noise images were selected from different micrographs near the tube
density to provide the most accurate combination of structural and detector related
noise. Three noise images were selected at random for each comparison, convolved
with the particles CTF, centred to a mean of zero, and normalized by the
subsequent images intensity range. To each of these images, a re-projection of the
final EM map at the given particles orientation was added (also convolved with the
particles CTF), centred and normalized. These three replicates were individually
subtracted from the data projection, everything being low-pass filtered to 12 Å.
Finally, the three difference images were masked off using a binary mask derived
from the projection of the corresponding CypA dimer reference (one for the dimer
and both monomer-binding modes, and one for the negative control).
The average CCC from the three replicates was calculated for all four binding
modes and used as the metric for classification. Those with a CCC 4 0 with the
dimer reference were initially separated from the full data set. This subset was then
further split in two, based on the difference between the left (‘up’) and right
(‘down’) binding modes, with a CCCup - CCCdown 4 0 indicating an ‘up’ class. No
particles were excluded from the analysis and no further alignment was introduced.
The classified maps were directly derived from the pre-aligned tube segments
that have been sorted into different classes.
Molecular dynamics flexible fitting. Ten tubular CypA-CA complexes were
derived as described in Supporting Information, and further refined using MDFF,
as follows. Ions near the surface of the protein were placed using cionize58. Bulk
water and Na/Cl ions were then added using visual molecular dynamics (VMD)58,
setting the total concentration of NaCl to 1 M. Each of the resulting systems
contained 1,900,000 protein atoms and B25,600,000 total atoms, including
solvent. The systems were equilibrated at 310 K and 1 atm for 5 ns while applying
positional restraints on all heavy atoms
of the protein. MDFF59 was then applied for 10 ns with a grid scaling of j ¼ 0.1
coupled only to backbone heavy atoms. Domain restraints were applied to
maintain the structural integrity of each individual CypA-CANTD complex.
Additional restraints were applied in the form of extra bonds to maintain
secondary structure integrity and to prevent transitions of cis/trans bonds and
chirality errors59. MDFF was performed using NAMD 2.9 (ref. 60) with the
CHARMM22-CMAP force field61,62. Simulated density maps needed for
determining cross-correlation between model and EM data, were generated
using VMD58.
Molecular dynamics simulations of CypA-CA complexes. All-atom MD simu-
lations of reduced systems for the two types of CypA-CA complexes, namely
bridged and disjoined, were performed. For this purpose, ions in close proximity to
the protein were placed using cionize. Bulk water and Na/Cl ions were then added
using VMD, setting the total concentration of NaCl to 1 M. The systems were
then equilibrated at 310 K and 1 atm for 10 ns using the NAMD 2.10 and
CHARMM36FF (ref. 63) together with the TIP3P water model64, corresponding to
simulations 3 and 5 in Supplementary Table 1. Simulations of CypA-CA complexes
were then performed, again employing NAMD 2.10, but with the polarizable
CHARMM force field based on the classical Drude oscillator model65,66 together
with the SWM4-NDP water model67 at 310 K and 1 atm (simulations 4 and 6 in
Supplementary Table 1).
All simulations carried out in the present study used the r-RESPA integrator
available in NAMD. Long-range electrostatic force calculations employed the PME
method (particle-mesh Ewald), utilizing a grid spacing of 2.1 Å and eighth order
interpolation, with a 1.2 nm cutoff. Simulations using the CHARMM additive force
field, employed a time-step of 2 fs, with non-bonded interactions evaluated every
2 fs and electrostatics updated every 4 fs; all hydrogen bonds were constrained with
the SHAKE algorithm. For the simulations employing the CHARMM Drude
polarizable force field (simulations 4 and 6), the systems were first equilibrated
using CHARMM36 for 10 ns at 310 K and 1 atm (simulations 3 and 5), then the
Drude particles were added using ‘drude prepper’ as implemented in CHARMM-
GUI68. All systems were minimized for 20 steps, and then equilibrated at 310 K and
1 atm for 1 ns while maintaining positional restraints for the proteins’ heavy atoms
with an integration time step of 0.5 fs. Screened Coulomb corrections of Thole were
calculated within a cutoff of 5 Å. Restraints were applied to a Drude oscillator if its
length exceeded 0.2 Å, assuming a force constant of 40000 kcal Å � 2. Production
runs were performed with a time step of 1 fs, with non-bonded interactions
evaluated every 1 fs and electrostatics updated every 1 fs. Temperature of the
Drude particles was maintained at 1 K.
Computational modelling of CypA-CA tubular complexes. A helical tube of CA
was constructed by docking the MDFF-derived hexameric structure (PDB: 3J34),
using Chimera, to each of the hexamers in the experimental tubular density with
( � 8, 13) helical symmetry. Reverse mutations, L6I, L83V, E92A and H120N, were
applied to match the wt (HXB2) sequence. Protonation states of titratable groups
were calculated using PDB2PQR (ref. 69). The tube was decorated with CypA
employing VMD70, as described below. Two binding modes of CypA to CA are

 observed in the CypA-CANTD crystal complex and, accordingly, in building the
tube model for each of the CA monomers in the lattice, one of the two CypA
conformers was selected, at random with equal probability. The location of the
CypA molecule was derived by aligning the CANTD domain of each CA in the
tubular lattice with the CANTD of the CypA-CANTD crystal structure (PDB: 1AK4)
(ref. 11) using root-mean-square fitting, with excellent agreement (Ca-RMSD of
0.5 Å). Coordinates were taken from the selected conformer, including the
coordinates of the CA loop binding to CypA. The procedure was repeated 10 times,
to explore the combinatorial complexity of the binding of CypA to CA. The
resulting 10 fully saturated CypA-CA tubes contain extensive clashes between
neighbouring CypAs. To correct for steric clashes, CypAs were removed from each
of the saturated models, following a random walk on a self-avoidance path over the
lattice. At each step of the removal procedure, a CypA was chosen at random, and,
if clashes between the selected CypA and adjacent CypAs were present, then the
adjacent CypA molecule(s) was (were) removed from the model. The procedure
was repeated over the set of remaining CypAs—those that had not been removed
or selected on a previous step—yielding a model with no clashes.
Solid-state NMR specimen preparation. Natural abundance CA and U-13C,15N-
labelled CypA proteins were concentrated to 30 mg ml � 1 in 25 mM phosphate
buffer (pH 5.5), and then mixed at varying CypA:CA ratios (1:4, 3:6 and 6:6).
Assemblies of CypA-CA were prepared by adding NaCl to a final salt concentration
of 2.4 M, followed by one-hour incubation at 37 �C. Assembled CypA-CA were
pelleted by centrifugation at 50,000 r.p.m. at 4 �C and packed into three 3.2 mm
thin-wall Bruker rotors. The amount of U-13C,15N-labelled CypA in each rotor was
B0.15 mmol.
MAS NMR spectroscopy. 2D MAS NMR spectra of CypA-CA assemblies were
acquired on a Bruker 19.9 T spectrometer with a 3.2 mm HCN Efree probe. Larmor
frequencies were 850.400 MHz for 1H, 213.833 MHz for 13C, and 86.170 MHz for
15N. 2D CORD and NCA spectra were collected at the MAS frequency of
14.000±0.001 kHz, regulated by a Bruker MAS controller, and the temperature
was maintained at 4.0±0.5 �C throughout the experiments by a Bruker tempera-
ture controller.
Typical pulse lengths were 2.6 ms (1H), 3.4 ms (13C) and 3.7 ms (15N); 1H-13C
cross-polarization was performed using a linear amplitude ramp, with the 1H rf
field of 88 kHz matched to the second spinning sideband. The 1H-13C and 1H-15N
contact times were 0.6 and 1.1 ms, respectively. The 15N-13C DCP contact time was
6 ms. Small phase incremental alternation 1H decoupling (95 kHz) was applied
during the evolution and acquisition periods. The modulated 1H field strengths
during CORD were 14 and 7 kHz, and the CORD mixing time was 50 ms. Under
these conditions predominantly one-bond correlations are observed in the spectra.
Time-proportional phase incrementation was used for frequency discrimination in
the indirect dimension.
Processing and analysis of solid-state NMR spectra. All spectra were processed
with NMRpipe and analysed using Sparky (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/home/sparky/).
30�-shifted, for CORD spectra, or 45�-shifted, for NC spectra, sine bell apodization
followed by a Lorentzian-to-Gaussian transformation was applied in both dimen-
sions. Forward linear prediction to twice the number of the original data points
was used in the indirect dimension, followed by zero filling to twice the total number
of points.
Analytical centrifugation. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed in
an XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) in two-channel Epon cen-
trepieces. The data were collected at 280 nm and a speed of 40,000 r.p.m. in an
An60Ti four-hole rotor at 25 �C. The concentration of protein loaded was
approximately 0.35 mg ml � 1. The data were analysed with the program SEDFIT
using the c(s) and c(s,ff0) models (http://www.analyticalultracentrifugation.com/
default.htm). The c(s) model was used for molecular weight estimation of the
sedimenting species. The buffer density, buffer viscosity, and protein partial specific
volume used in these calculations were estimated with the program SEDNTERP
(http://bitcwiki.sr.unh.edu/index.php/Main_Page).
