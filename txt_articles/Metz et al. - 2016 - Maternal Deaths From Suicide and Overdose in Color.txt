Abstract
Objective—To ascertain demographic and clinical characteristics of maternal deaths from self-
harm (accidental overdose or suicide) in order to identify opportunities for prevention.
Methods—We report a case series of pregnancy-associated deaths due to self-harm in the state of 
Colorado between 2004 and 2012. Self-harm deaths were identified from several sources, 
including death certificates. Birth and death certificates along with coroner, prenatal care and 
delivery hospitalization records were abstracted. Descriptive analyses were performed. For 
context, we describe demographic characteristics of women with a maternal death from self-harm 
and all women with live births in Colorado.
Results—Among the 211 total maternal deaths in Colorado over the study interval, 30% (n=63) 
resulted from self-harm. The pregnancy-associated death ratio from overdose was 5.0 (95% CI 3.4, 
7.2) per 100,000 live births and from suicide 4.6 (95% CI 3.0, 6.6) per 100,000 live births. 
Detailed records were obtained for 94% (n=59) of women with deaths from self-harm. Deaths 
were equally distributed throughout the first postpartum year (mean 6.21 ± 3.3 months 
postpartum) with only 6 maternal deaths during pregnancy. Seventeen percent (n=10) had a known 
substance use disorder. Prior psychiatric diagnoses were documented in 54% (n=32) and prior 
suicide attempts in 10% (n=6). While half (n=27) of the women with deaths from self-harm were 
noted to be taking psycho-pharmacotherapy at conception, 48% of them discontinued the 
medications during pregnancy. Fifty women had toxicology testing available; pharmaceutical 
opioids were the most common drug identified (n=21).

 Conclusion—Self-harm was the most common cause of pregnancy-associated mortality with 
most deaths occurring in the postpartum period. A four-pronged educational and program building 
effort to include women, providers, health care systems, and both governments and organizations 
at the community and national level may allow for a reduction in maternal deaths.
Introduction
Reduction of maternal mortality has become a priority in the United States and other 
nations.1,2 As a consequence of collaborative efforts between the American College of 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 
Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, and others, common causes of pregnancy-related 
mortality such as hemorrhage, hypertension, venous thromboembolism, and infection, are 
now targeted with specific action plans and safety bundles delineating appropriate clinical 
care.2 In February 2016, the Council on Patient Safety in Women's Healthcare released a 
safety bundle for maternal mental health which summarizes screening strategies and 
suggested responses when disorders are identified.3
Despite these advances, there has been relatively little focus on maternal deaths resulting 
from self-harm, specifically those related to accidental overdose and suicide. This lack of 
focus on deaths from self-harm may be, in part, a result of barriers to screening and 
treatment for psychiatric disorders.4,5 The lack of recognition of deaths from self-harm as a 
significant contributor to maternal death may also be a result of the exclusion of accidental 
or incidental deaths occurring during pregnancy or in the first year postpartum from 
reporting to the CDC as pregnancy-related mortality.6 The first steps in prevention include 
gaining a better understanding the characteristics of women with a maternal death resulting 
from self-harm.
The objectives of this study were to define rates of maternal deaths from self-harm in 
Colorado, describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of women who died, and 
assess risk factors for these deaths to identify opportunities for prevention.
Materials and Methods
We conducted a case study of all women with pregnancy-associated deaths (death during 
pregnancy or within 1 year postpartum from any cause) from self-harm in Colorado from 
January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2012. Deaths due to suicide (regardless of cause, 
including suicide by poisoning) and drug overdoses (unintentional poisonings and 
poisonings of undetermined intent) were categorized broadly as deaths from “self-harm” for 
the purposes of this study, as it is often difficult for the coroner and Colorado Maternal 
Mortality Review Committee (a panel of experts including obstetrician–gynecologists, 
perinatologists, substance use disorder experts, injury prevention experts, psychiatrists and a 
coroner) to accurately classify these deaths by intent even after reviewing all available 
documentation.7,8 This approach was also supported by prior literature demonstrating an 
over-classification of overdoses as accidental rather than suicide.7 Cases of overdoses are not 
classified as suicide by a medical examiner or coroner unless there is clear evidence 
indicating an intention to take one's own life and deliberate means. Often this must be

 corroborated by other evidence of suicide such as a suicide note, known suicidal ideations, 
or a prior attempt.7 When cases of maternal death by accidental overdose are reviewed by 
mental and behavioral health experts on the Colorado Maternal Mortality Review 
Committee, it is often concluded that the death may have been intentional despite a 
documented manner of death of accidental. Thus, these outcomes were combined for the 
purposes of this study.
Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was sought from both the Colorado Multiple IRB 
(as data were to be analyzed at the University of Colorado) and the Colorado Department of 
Public Health and Environment IRB (as data were abstracted at the Colorado Department of 
Public Health and Environment). This project was deemed exempt by the Colorado Multiple 
IRB since all subjects were deceased and approved by the Colorado Department of Public 
Health and Environment IRB.
Process of Identifying Maternal Deaths in Colorado
Each year, Colorado maternal deaths are identified by the Colorado Department of Public 
Health and Environment from three sources: (1) International Classification of Disease 
(ICD) -10 “O” codes on the death certificate, indicating that the cause of death was related 
to or aggravated by pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium; (2) selection of a pregnancy 
field on the Colorado death certificate (includes ‘pregnant at the time of death’, ‘not 
pregnant, but pregnant within 42 days of death’, and ‘not pregnant, but pregnant 43 days to 1 
year before death’); and (3) matching of all state death certificates among females age 8-65 
years to the reported name of the mother on all live birth and fetal death certificates during 
the same year as the death or the year prior.
After identifying possible cases of maternal death by these methods, Colorado Department 
of Public Health and Environment staff and members of the Colorado Maternal Mortality 
Review Committee excluded cases which did not meet the accepted definition of a 
pregnancy-associated death (death during pregnancy or within 1 year postpartum from any 
cause).9 The Maternal Mortality Review Committee categorized all pregnancy-associated 
deaths and did not limit our review to the CDC definition of pregnancy-related mortality 
which excludes deaths from accidental or incidental causes.6
Cases of maternal death from self-harm were identified from all maternal deaths in Colorado 
over the study time period. Deaths from self-harm were identified from death certificate 
documentation of a suicide or accident, with a secondary classification of overdose. 
Accidental overdoses included poisonings from illicit drugs and medications. If the manner 
of death was documented as unknown or natural on the death certificate, we relied on the 
determination of the Colorado Maternal Mortality Review Committee that the death was a 
result of overdose or suicide.
For identified maternal deaths from self-harm, three written contacts were made by 
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment staff to obtain records from the 
coroner, primary prenatal care provider, and hospital of delivery and/or death. Records 
requested included: birth certificate, death certificate, labor and delivery records, prenatal 
and postpartum care medical records (including social work and psychiatric records, when

 available), autopsy report, toxicology testing, coroner's report, and law enforcement report 
(if applicable).
All available self-harm death records were reviewed by a medical professional trained in 
detailed data abstraction using a data abstraction instrument developed by the investigators. 
Data abstraction items included sociodemographics (race, ethnicity, maternal age, marital 
status, type of residence, insurance status, weeks of gestation or number of months 
postpartum at time of death), psychiatric history (documented psychiatric diagnosis, current 
psycho-pharmacotherapy, discussion about continuation of pharmacotherapy during 
pregnancy, prior suicide attempts, and current or prior substance use), social history 
(involvement of the father of the child, living situation, employment status), and clinical 
history (preterm delivery, adverse obstetrical events).
Drugs identified on toxicology testing at the time of death were categorized by drug class as 
opioids, alcohols, benzodiazepines, other sedatives or hypnotics, antidepressants, 
amphetamines, muscle relaxants, cannabinoids, acetaminophen, anesthetics, antipsychotics, 
barbiturates, or phencyclidine. Illegal drugs (cocaine, heroin, phencyclidine) were combined 
into an illicit drug category for further descriptive analysis. Of note, medicinal marijuana 
was legal in Colorado for a portion of the study period. Marijuana was not fully legalized for 
recreational use until after the study period. However, given the overlap with legalization of 
medicinal marijuana, cannabinoids were not included as illicit drugs. Prescription opioids 
(including methadone), benzodiazepines, sedatives/hypnotics, antidepressants and muscle 
relaxants were grouped as pharmaceutical medications.
All data were abstracted into a secure web-based Research Electronic Data Capture 
(REDCap) application.10
Data from live births were extracted from state birth certificate data by Colorado Department 
of Public Health and Environment staff. While maternal deaths and live births are not 
mutually exclusive, state-wide data on all live births over the study time period were 
collected to provide context for our detailed data abstraction including the frequency and 
percent of women in each category of residence (urban, rural, frontier, unknown), race, 
marital status, and insurance status.
Descriptive data (frequencies, percentages) for maternal deaths from self-harm were 
generated. Death ratios were calculated over the number of live births per year. Categorical 
demographic characteristics were summarized for women with a maternal death from drug 
overdose or suicide, and for all women with a live birth in Colorado over the same time 
period. All analyses were completed in SAS 9.4, and graphics were created in GraphPad 
Prism 6.0.
Results
There were 211 maternal deaths in Colorado over the 9-year study period (January 1, 2004 
through December 31, 2012), of which 63 (30%) were classified as maternal death by self-
harm (accidental overdose or suicide). Self-harm was the leading cause of maternal death in 
Colorado (Figure 1). From 2004 to 2012, the overall pregnancy-associated mortality ratio

 was 34.4 (95% CI 29.9, 39.3) per 100,000 live births; the mortality ratio from accidental 
overdose was 5.0 (95% CI 3.4, 7.2) per 100,000 live births and from suicide was 4.6 (95% 
CI 3.0, 6.6) per 100,000 live births.
Detailed medical records were obtained for 94% (n=59) of women who died of accidental 
overdoses (n=31) or suicide (n=28). The manner of death on the death certificate was 
accidental with a sub-classification of drug overdose in 26 cases. There were 5 additional 
cases for which the manner of death on the death certificate was unknown that were 
subsequently classified as accidental overdose by the Colorado Maternal Mortality Review 
Committee. In all of these cases, there was evidence of overdose by toxicology testing.
The manner of death was documented on the death certificate as suicide in 26 cases. Among 
the women with suicide documented as the manner of death, the most common means were 
further sub-classified as asphyxia by hanging (n=10), penetrating trauma (gunshot wound or 
stab wound, n=8), and intentional overdose (n=5). There were two cases in which suicide 
was not documented on the death certificate but the coroner and police report indicated that 
the death was the result of suicide; the Colorado Maternal Mortality Review Committee 
classified these as suicides and they were included in the study. No cases of infanticide were 
documented in association with maternal death from self-harm.
Sociodemographic characteristics of the maternal deaths due to accidental overdose and 
suicide are summarized in Table 1.
Toxicology results were available from 50 (84.7%) of the decedents: a single drug or 
medication was identified in 12 (24.0%), two drugs or medications were identified in 10 
(20.0%), three or more drugs or medications were identified in 22 (44.0%). No drugs or 
medications were identified in toxicology testing from six decedents (12.0%). 
Pharmaceutical medications were most commonly identified, with 27 (54.0%) of the 
decedents with a positive toxicology test for a medication, and 14 (28.0%) with illicit drugs, 
including 10 with cocaine or cocaine metabolites and 4 with heroin (6-monoacetyl-
morphine) or a heroin metabolite (morphine with known recent heroin use).
Among the 50 women with toxicology testing available, the most commonly detected class 
of drugs was opioids. In 21 (42.0%) cases pharmaceutical opioids were detected. In 3 cases, 
heroin or heroin metabolites were detected with no other opioids. In almost all cases of a 
pharmaceutical opioid overdose, there was documentation of a recent prescription for 
opioids, a known opioid use disorder, or empty opioid pill bottles found at the scene of the 
death. There was only one case in which the coroner's report documented that opioids were 
“bought on the street”; in all other cases, the women were thought to have been prescribed 
opioids. Classes of drugs detected on toxicology screening are reported in Figure 2.
Deaths were equally distributed throughout the first postpartum year (mean 6.21 ± 3.3 
months postpartum) with only 6 maternal deaths during pregnancy (Figure 3). The deaths 
during pregnancy occurred on average at 19.2 ± 11.6 weeks gestation, with the earliest 
occurring at approximately 5 weeks gestation and the latest occurring at 35 weeks gestation.

 Eighty-one percent (n=48) of the 59 included women with maternal deaths from self-harm 
had prenatal records available for review by the study team. Three of the 59 women did not 
have prenatal care as documented at the time of delivery. The remaining 8 women in the 
case study may have had prenatal care, but we were unable to obtain antenatal records from 
the primary obstetrician despite three attempts. Among the women with prenatal records 
available, the mean gestational age at initiation of prenatal care was 13.2 ± 6.5 weeks 
gestation. Women with prenatal care had a mean of 7.9 (95% CI 6.6, 9.4) prenatal visits. Of 
the 46 women who had prenatal care and the opportunity to attend a postpartum visit (i.e. 
did not die while pregnant), 20 (43.5%) attended a postpartum visit.
Among the 59 maternal deaths from self-harm, 16.9% (n=10) had a substance use disorder 
documented in the prenatal medical record or during hospitalization for delivery or death; of 
whom 6 were either currently in substance use disorder treatment or had a documented 
history of substance use disorder treatment. In 10 (16.9%) cases, there was no 
documentation of screening for substance use disorder in the prenatal medical record. A 
urine toxicology screen was performed at a prenatal visit for only 8 (13.6%) of the women.
Prior psychiatric diagnoses (Table 1) were documented in the clinical records of 54.2% 
(n=32) and prior suicide attempts in 10.2% (n=6). Of the 6 women with documentation of 
prior suicide attempts, five completed suicide and 1 died of an accidental overdose. Thirteen 
women (22.0%) did not have a known psychiatric or substance use disorder.
Depression was the most common documented psychiatric diagnosis (Table 1). While 
approximately half (n=27) of the self-harm cases were documented to be taking psycho-
pharmacotherapy at conception, 48% of them discontinued the medications as a result of the 
pregnancy. Self-discontinuation of the medication(s) occurred in 9 cases, and 
discontinuation at the recommendation of a physician occurred in 4 cases. In the majority of 
women, psycho-pharmacotherapy consisted of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs). Other notable prescribed therapies included: sleep aids, mood stabilizers, and other 
classes of antidepressants. SSRIs were the drug class most commonly discontinued during 
pregnancy; 10 of the 13 women who discontinued medications stopped taking an SSRI. Four 
of the 13 women who were documented to have stopped the medications during pregnancy 
had psychiatric medications on toxicology testing at the time of autopsy.
Social stressors were commonly documented in the medical records of women who died of 
self-harm including: unemployment (n=38, 64.4%), being single, divorced or separated 
(n=24, 40.7%), history of domestic violence (n=11, 18.6%), unstable living situations such 
as homelessness (n=3, 5.1%), and current domestic violence (n=3, 5.1%). Based on the 
medical record or coroner report, the father of the child was noted to be involved in the 
majority (n=41, 69.5%) of cases. Despite documentation of social stress in the majority of 
women, engagement with a social worker was only found in 21 (35.6%) cases either during 
the course of prenatal care or at the time of delivery.
Adverse obstetrical events [preterm delivery, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, 3rd or 4th 
degree laceration, stillbirth, neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or maternal ICU 
admission] occurred in 16 (27.1%) cases. There was a preterm (<37 weeks gestation)

 delivery rate of 10.2% (n=6) among the cases; all of these neonates were admitted to the 
neonatal ICU.
The demographic characteristics of women with a maternal death are summarized along 
with the characteristics of all women with live births in Colorado over the same time period 
in Table 2.
Discussion
Self-harm (accidental overdose and suicide) was the leading cause of maternal death in 
Colorado from 2004 to 2012, with a mortality ratio of 9.6 per 100,000 live births. Almost 
90% of the deaths from self-harm occurred in the postpartum period. In the majority of 
cases, substance use and psychiatric disorders were present. However, in 22% of women 
with maternal deaths neither of these risk factors were present. Depression was the most 
common psychiatric diagnosis. Almost half of women on psychiatric medications in early 
pregnancy discontinued them during pregnancy or postpartum either on their own or at the 
recommendation of a care provider. Pharmaceutical opioids were the most common 
substance identified on toxicology screening at the time of autopsy.
Colorado's maternal death ratio from suicide (4.6 per 100,000 live births) is higher than that 
reported based on national pregnancy mortality surveillance (1.6-4.5 suicides per 100,000 
live births)11, and data from the National Violent Death Reporting System (2.0 suicides per 
100,000 live births).12 Colorado's higher suicide ratio may be the result of the 
comprehensive case identification approach employed by this study. Alternatively, our rates 
of suicide in pregnancy and postpartum may reflect the high rates of suicide in the general 
Colorado population. Suicide was the most common cause of death in Coloradans age 10-44 
years, with a rate of 19.7 per 100,000 population in 2012.13
The lack of ongoing treatment for psychiatric disorders observed in our case study is 
consistent with a recently published study from the United Kingdom demonstrating that 
perinatal women were more likely to carry a diagnosis of depression yet were half as likely 
to receive any active treatment than non-perinatal women.14 These findings contrast with the 
accumulating body of evidence supporting the safety of antidepressants such as serotonin 
specific reuptake inhibitors in pregnancy.15,16
Maternal deaths were infrequent during pregnancy, consistent with existing literature.17,18 
Less than 50% of women with maternal deaths from self-harm attended a postpartum visit; 
thus, targeting postpartum visits alone for depression screening and management will be 
inadequate to reach women at risk. Rather, each point of contact with women at risk for self-
harm should be considered an opportunity for intervention including: pre-conception visits, 
antenatal care, hospitalization for delivery, and postpartum visits for both the mother and the 
neonate. During pregnancy and postpartum, women at risk for self-harm may encounter 
various types of providers including social workers, nurses, and physicians (psychiatrists, 
addiction specialists, obstetricians, adult primary care providers, pediatricians, and 
emergency medicine physicians). Resources for providers for screening and referring 
women at risk for self-harm are readily available from multiple organizations such as the

Administration (http://store.samhsa.gov/shin/content/SMA14-4878/SMA14-4878.pdf), and 
the Council on Patient Safety in Women's Health (http://
www.safehealthcareforeverywoman.org).
Successful interventions for prevention of maternal self-harm will likely require a multi-
tiered approach, with interventions based at the individual patient and provider level, as well 
as broader changes at the health care delivery system and community level. We provide 
examples of potential interventions at each of these four levels in Table 3. Our group has 
integrated perinatal mental health screening, assessment and treatment into prenatal clinics, 
similar to a recently published study by Avalos et al.19 Universal screening will be necessary 
to identify the 22% of women in our series who did not have any identifiable risk factors for 
self-harm. To this end, we hope to establish virtual and electronic access to mental health 
resources for physicians in rural communities without local psychiatric services, so that 
providers can screen women for mental health disorders, and then promptly refer for further 
assessment and treatment. We also now include substance use and psychiatric experts on our 
Maternal Mortality Review Committee.
Strengths of this study include 9 years of data from multiple sources that were reviewed by 
the Colorado Maternal Mortality Review Committee. Detailed chart abstraction allowed for 
ascertainment of data that are not available by collecting diagnostic codes alone. Limitations 
of this study include a possible underestimation of psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, and 
medications, as well as substance use treatment, since psychiatric records may not always 
have been available through the hospital or prenatal care providers. Further, we could not 
make comparisons to other women with live births in Colorado over the same time period 
for prevalence of risk factors given the limited demographic data available on birth 
certificates.
Our findings suggest that initiatives to increase community awareness, screening and referral 
to treatment for mental health and substance use disorders in pregnancy, along with 
recognition of the need for ongoing care beyond the early postpartum period, will be critical 
in reducing pregnancy-associated deaths from self-harm.
