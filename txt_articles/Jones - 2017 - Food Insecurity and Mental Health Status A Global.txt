Food Insecurity and Mental Health Status:
A Global Analysis of 149 Countries
Andrew D. Jones, PhD
Introduction: This study sought to determine the association of individual-level food insecurity
(FI) with mental health status across all global regions.
Methods: Cross-sectional data were analyzed in 2016 from the 2014 Gallup World Poll, a series of
globally implemented, nationally representative surveys. FI was assessed using the Food Insecurity
Experience Scale Survey Module for Individuals, an eight-question psychometric scale reporting
individuals’ experiences of FI. Individual-level composite indices of mental health, the Negative
Experience Index and Positive Experience Index (0–100 scale), were calculated based on responses to
five questions of respondents’ recent negative and positive experiences, respectively, associated with
depression and mental distress.
Results: The prevalence of any FI ranged from 18.3% in East Asia to 76.1% in Sub-Saharan Africa.
In global analyses (149 countries) using adjusted multiple regression analyses, FI was associated in a
dose–response fashion with poorer scores on the mental health indices (coefficient [95% CI]:
Negative Experience Index: mild FI, 10.4 [9.5, 11.2]; moderate FI, 17.7 [16.4, 19.0]; severe FI, 24.5
[22.7, 26.3]; Positive Experience Index: mild FI, –8.3 [–9.3, –7.4]; moderate FI, –12.6 [–13.8, –11.3];
severe FI, –16.2 [–17.9, –14.5]). Within-region analyses (11 regions) consistently demonstrated the
same trends.
Conclusions: FI is associated with poorer mental health and specific psychosocial stressors across
global regions independent of SES. The numerous pathways via which FI may contribute to
common mental disorders, and the broad social implications of FI linked to cultural norms and self-
efficacy, may contribute to the cross-cultural consistency of the findings.

INTRODUCTION
D
espite considerable progress over the past quar-
ter century in increasing global food production,
nearly 795 million people worldwide remain
food insecure.1 Food insecurity (FI) is a complex
phenomenon that encompasses food availability, afford-
ability, the cultural norms that dictate acceptable means
of acquiring food, and individual food utilization.2 Given
the diverse set of conditions that contribute to FI, it is
perhaps not surprising that FI is associated with a
diversity of nutrition-related health outcomes including
dietary inadequacies,3 early child growth faltering,4
obesity,5 poor physical health,6 low educational achieve-
ment,7 and developmental deficits in children.8 However,
not all health consequences of FI have direct nutritional
etiologies. In fact, adverse mental health outcomes
among food-insecure individuals, not necessarily linked
to nutritional deficiencies or excesses, are of increasing
concern.9–12
Mental and substance use disorders are the leading
cause of years lived with disability worldwide and
account for 7.4% of all disability-adjusted life years.13
Nearly one in three individuals (29.2%) globally experi-
ence a common mental disorder during their lifetime
such as depression, anxiety, and somatic symptom
disorders.14 FI may be a key contributor to common

 mental disorders through several different mechanisms.
First, by generating uncertainty over the ability to
maintain food supplies, or to acquire sufficient food in
the future, FI can provoke a stress response that may
contribute to anxiety and depression.15,16 Furthermore,
acquiring foods in socially unacceptable ways can induce
feelings of alienation, powerlessness, shame, and guilt
that are associated with depression.17–19 FI may also
magnify socioeconomic disparities within households
and communities that could increase cultural sensitivities
and influence overall mental well-being.20
Existing research examining the relation between FI
and mental health has disproportionately targeted areas
with high levels of FI and emphasized the experiences of
women rather than men.20 Furthermore, there is sub-
stantial variation in the design of existing studies as well
as in the measurement approaches used to assess FI and
mental health status.21–24 Therefore, it is unclear if
observed associations between FI and mental health vary
across diverse contexts and populations, or the extent to
which differences in design and measurement may be
responsible for heterogeneous findings. If FI is indeed an
important contributing factor to poor mental health
outcomes, interventions to reduce FI may have unin-
tended positive impacts. Therefore, confirming the
strength and consistency of the relation between FI and
mental health status across contexts could be important
for attracting resources both to address FI and confront
burgeoning mental health challenges in novel ways
through food security interventions.
The specific objectives of this study were to (1) determine
the association of individual-level FI with mental health
status across all global regions, and (2) assess heterogeneity
in this association across global regions, and by age and sex
of respondents. It was hypothesized that higher levels of
individual-level FI would be associated with poorer mental
health status across and within global regions, independent
of SES. Given that women in high- and low-income
countries have higher prevalence rates of mood and anxiety
disorders than men,14 and that FI may have differential
health consequences for women than men,25,26 it was also
hypothesized that sex would modify the association
between FI and mental health status. Furthermore, given
that the cognitive, emotional, and physical consequences of
FI may be different for individuals across the life cycle,27–29
it was further hypothesized that age would modify the
association between FI and mental health status.
METHODS
Study Sample
The data used for this 2016 analysis were from the 2014 Gallup
World Poll (GWP), a series of nationally representative surveys of
individuals aged Z15 years that uses probability sampling cover-
ing both urban and rural areas.30 In a first-stage sampling, 100–135
sampling units (i.e., clusters of households) were selected based on
probabilities proportional to population size or random sampling
(depending on availability of population information) and strati-
fied by population size and geographic location. Households
within sampling units and index respondents within households
were then randomly selected in separate stages. The survey
included a core questionnaire applied in nearly all countries as
well as region-specific modules. Face-to-face interviews were
carried out in all countries with o80% telephone coverage. The
sample size of the GWP in each country varied depending on
population size (Appendix Table 1, available online).
Measures
The 2014 GWP assessed FI using the Food Insecurity Experience
Scale Survey Module for Individuals (FIES SM-I). The FIES SM-I is
a psychometric scale composed of eight questions with dichoto-
mous responses that ask respondents to report experiences of FI of
varying degrees of severity that are common across cultural
contexts (e.g., anxiety, altering food quality, and limiting food
intake) (Appendix Table 2, available online).31 A single-parameter
logistic Item Response Theory model was used to estimate severity
parameters from each question response using conditional max-
imum likelihood methods, testing for model assumptions of equal
discrimination and overall model fit via Rasch reliability statis-
tics.32 The mean Rasch reliability for FIES SM-I was 0.740, and fell
between 0.70 and 0.80 for 79% of countries in the GWP.32
Respondents’ FI status was calculated by summing the scores
from all eight questions and categorizing them into one of four
levels of FI (raw score range): food secure (0), mild FI (1–3),
moderate FI (4–6), and severe FI (7–8).33 Because the GWP is
administered at different times in different countries, a recall
period of 12 months was used to exclude potential confounding by
seasonality and to ensure cross-country comparability. A standard
protocol based on formative research was developed to guide the
translation of the questionnaire in each country.34
Aggregate indices of mental health calculated by Gallup World-
wide Research were used in analyses. The Negative Experience Index
(NEI) is an individual-level composite index of responses to five
questions that report data on recent negative experiences of the
respondent that may impact overall well-being (Appendix Table 3,
available online). The index was calculated by taking the mean of
coded responses to all five questions and multiplying the result by
100. Values for the final index ranged from 0 to 100, with higher
values indicating more negative recent experiences. Questions with
missing data were excluded from the index, and the index was only
calculated for an individual if at least four questions were answered.
The Positive Experience Index (PEI) was constructed in the same
manner as the NEI, but included data on self-reported assessment of
recent positive experiences (Appendix Table 3, available online).
Higher values on the PEI indicate more positive recent experiences.
Gallup Worldwide Research tested the scale reliability of the indices.
The NEI and PEI demonstrate Cronbach’s alphas of 0.80 and 0.91,
respectively, when aggregated at the country level.30
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out using Stata, version 13.1.
Means and variance by global region were calculated for the FIES

 SM-I, NEI, and PEI. The proportion of FI among individuals
within each region was also calculated. Post-stratification weights
provided by Gallup that weight data by sex, age, education, and
SES were used to ensure that estimates within each country were
nationally representative. Taylor-linearized SEs that adjusted for
the multistage sampling frame of the 2014 GWP were applied to all
estimates.
Multiple linear regression and multiple logistic regression
models, respectively, were used to examine the association of FI
with the NEI and PEI, and the psychosocial conditions and
experiences that constitute the indices (e.g., being treated with
respect, experiencing worry, sadness, stress, anger, and enjoy-
ment). Adjusted models controlled for urbanicity; annual house-
hold income (calculated from annualized household income data
converted to international dollars using World Bank purchasing
power parity figures for private consumption35); the number of
children aged o15 years in the household; the sex, age, education,
and employment status of the respondent; as well as country fixed
effects. Statistical interactions were tested between FI and respond-
ent age and sex. In select countries where telephone interviews
were administered, questions for the FIES SM-I, NEI, and PEI were
administered to half of respondents (i.e., in one of two nationally
representative survey waves) (Appendix Table 4, available online).
In sensitivity analyses, missing values for these variables were
imputed using an iterative Markov-chain Monte Carlo multiple
imputation method (Appendix Table 5, available online). For all
models, SEs and variance–covariance matrices of the estimators
were adjusted for within-country correlations. Associations were
considered statistically significant at po0.05.
The informed consent of all survey participants was obtained
and survey protocols were approved by the required governing
bodies of each country.
RESULTS
Data were available for 190,348 individuals in the 2014
GWP; FI data were available for 147,826 individuals.
Mean respondent age was 42 (SD¼17) years. In total,
11.7%, 52.4%, 25.5%, and 10.5% of the sample, respec-
tively, was aged 15–19, 20–45, 46–65, and 465 years.
The proportion of male (49.5%) and female (50.5%)
respondents within each age grouping were nearly
identical. Across the 11 assessed world regions, encom-
passing 149 countries, the prevalence of any FI among
individuals ranged from 18.3% in East Asia to 76.1% in
Sub-Saharan Africa (Table 1).
Data for the mental health indices were available for
152,696 individuals. The PEI was highest in Latin
America and the Caribbean region (79.4, 95% CI¼79.0,
79.8) and lowest in Russia and the Caucasus (59.2, 95%
CI¼58.3, 60.2); the NEI was lowest in Central Asia (17.4,
95% CI¼16.6, 18.2) and highest in the Middle East and
North Africa region (34.9, 95% CI¼34.3, 35.5) (Table 1).
Using the aggregated global data set, individual-level
FI was associated with poorer mental health status in a
dose–response fashion (coefficient [95% CI]: NEI: mild
FI, 10.4 [9.5, 11.2]; moderate FI, 17.7 [16.4, 19.0]; severe
FI, 24.5 [22.7, 26.3]; PEI: mild FI, –8.3 [–9.3, –7.4];
moderate FI, –12.6 [–13.8, –11.3]; severe FI, –16.2 [–17.9,
–14.5]) (Table 2). The magnitude of the association
between FI and the mental health indices was greater
than that of the assessed socioeconomic variables (i.e.,
education and employment status of respondent, and
annual household income) (Table 2). In interaction
models, no consistent interaction was observed between
FI and sex on the association with the NEI or PEI
(p40.05). However, age interacted with FI such that,
among older individuals, the association between FI was
more positive for the NEI (po0.001) and more negative
for the PEI (po0.01) (Table 2, Appendix Figures 1 and 2,
Appendix Table 6, available online). In regional analyses,
this interaction for individuals aged 465 years was
observed only in middle- and high-income regions
(po0.05) (i.e., Australia and New Zealand, Europe, Latin
America and the Caribbean, Middle East, and North
Africa) (Appendix Table 7, available online).
Similar to the globally aggregated analysis, within-
region analyses showed that individual-level FI was
associated with poorer mental health status, and that
the extent of poor mental health was greater with
increasing severity of FI (Table 3). This dose–response
relationship held for both mental health indices across all
regions, with the exception of the PEI for the Australia
and New Zealand and East Asia regions.
Individual-level FI was consistently associated, in a
dose–response fashion, with higher and lower odds,
respectively, of recently experiencing negative psychoso-
cial conditions (e.g., sadness, worry, stress, anger) and
positive psychosocial conditions (e.g., enjoyment, feeling
well rested, being treated with respect) (po0.001)
(Table 4). FI at any level was associated with higher odds
of recent experience of worry and sadness than other
negative experiences and conditions.
DISCUSSION
Independent of socioeconomic and demographic char-
acteristics of respondents, individual-level FI was asso-
ciated with poorer mental health status in a dose–
response fashion in both global and region-specific
analyses using two different aggregate indices of mental
health and well-being. The consistency of this association
across all global regions suggests that this relation applies
across cultural contexts. Experiences of FI, including
worrying about food, acquiring food in socially unac-
ceptable ways, disruptions of meal patterns, family
rituals, and intra-familial transfer of knowledge and
practices, as well as alterations in food quality and
quantity, are common across different cultures.31 Many
of these experiences of FI are themselves reflective of the

Urbanicity distinctions are described by Gallup Worldwide Research as follows: City: “large city”; Suburb: “suburb of a large city”; Town: “small town or
village”; Rural: “rural area or on a farm.” Income quintiles were calculated based on country-specific distributions. The reference categories for the
variables in the model are as follows: urbanicity: rural; sex of respondent: male; education level of respondent: elementary education or less;
employment status of respondent: unemployed; quintiles of annual household income: medium.

 psychosocial conditions that underlie poor mental health
status (e.g., worry, anxiety), or are associated with similar
social cues across cultures (e.g., feelings of shame, guilt,
exclusion, and powerlessness associated with food insuf-
ficiency or acquiring food in socially unacceptable
ways).36–39 Therefore, the cross-cultural consistency of
the findings from this study is aligned both with prior
research and evidence-based theory regarding people’s
lived experiences of FI.
The consistent dose–response trend observed in the
association between FI and mental health status strength-
ens the plausible causal nature of this association.40 This
trend suggests that the psychosocial stressors that under-
lie the mental health indices examined may be amplified
with increasing FI. For example, anxiety related to one’s
ability to acquire sufficient food in the future may be
provoked even under conditions of mild FI, and is likely
to increase with moderate and severe FI.41 Alternatively,
multiple pathways from FI to poorer mental health may
be invoked with increasing severity of FI. Under con-
ditions of more severe FI, for example, individuals may
resort to acquiring food in socially unacceptable ways as a
coping strategy.31 The feelings of shame and guilt
associated with this behavior could compound pre-
existing anxiety precipitated by mild FI to yield even
poorer mental health conditions.
It was hypothesized that sex would modify the association
between FI and mental health status. However, this effect
modification was not observed. Previous studies that have
examined the association of FI with mental health have been
largely female-dominated samples, and therefore have not
assessed sex-based differences in this relation.20 Though
women in this study scored more poorly on the mental
health indices than men, the findings suggest that the
potential influence of FI on mental health and well-being is
similar for men and women. Yet, effect modification by age
was observed. The association between FI was more positive
and negative for the NEI and the PEI, respectively, partic-
ularly among individuals aged 465 years. The prevalence of
mental and neurologic disorders is high among older
adults.42 Indeed, increasing age was associated with poorer
mental health status (Table 2). Older individuals may also be
especially vulnerable to FI because of limited mobility, low
incomes, and ill health.43 Previous research has shown FI to
be associated with depressive symptoms in the elderly.44,45
Variation in access to social safety net programs and familial
and social support systems for elderly individuals may
explain why the interaction with age was only observed
among middle- and high-income regions.46
Limitations
To the author’s knowledge, this study is the first to carry
out a global analysis of the association between FI and
mental health status. The GWP data allow the unique
opportunity to universally assess this association using
standardized measures across a diverse geographic sam-
ple of both men and women. However, this study has
several limitations. It was hypothesized that FI influences
mental health status, yet the direction of this relation
cannot be determined from this cross-sectional analysis,
nor can confounding by unobserved factors (or imperfect
adjustment) be ruled out despite rigorous adjustment in
regression models. It is plausible, for example, that poor
mental health status could influence individual-level FI
or that the two conditions are mutually reinforcing.
Indeed, psychosocial determinants may underlie material
deprivation associated with FI,47,48 and with intragene-
rational and intergenerational
feedback loops that
strengthen and perpetuate health inequities. The distinct
recall periods of the FIES-SM-I, NEI, and PEI may also
limit the ability to infer temporal congruity in the
observed associations. Additionally, though the FIES
SM-I was explicitly designed for cross-cultural compa-
rability and assesses domains of FI that are common
across contexts,31,32 it is possible that not all estimates of
FI are directly comparable across countries.49 However,
testing of the equal discrimination assumption of Rasch
models for the FIES SM-I indicated satisfactory stand-
ardized item infit values to justify inclusion of all FIES
SM-I items in all countries.32 Therefore, it is unlikely that
incomparability across countries strongly influenced the
observed results. Missing data from countries where
some data were collected in only one survey wave were
also a potential limitation. However, analyses using
imputed data for missing values of FI, the NEI, and
PEI indicated that the findings were robust to missing
data (Appendix Table 5, available online). Finally, though
the NEI and PEI demonstrated high internal consistency,
the external validity or clinical relevance of these indices
has not been assessed. Such validation is commonly done
by examining scale performance in relation to a psychi-
atric assessment to establish cut points for diagnosing
common mental disorders among specific populations.50
No cut points for the NEI or PEI were used in this
analysis, and these indices cannot be interpreted as
clinical diagnoses of psychosis, mood, or somatoform
disorders. Rather, used as continuous scores, they indicate
the extent to which individuals experienced psychosocial
conditions that are common to widely used and validated
instruments that assess mental health status.51,52 For
globally aggregated analyses, it is likely not possible to
develop a uniform instrument that reflects a globally valid
clinical assessment of mental health status. A substantial
research literature has demonstrated differences in con-
ceptualizations of mental health distress across cultures,
which raises concerns about cross-cultural meaning

 equivalence of validated mental health assessments.14
Therefore, assessing experiences of psychosocial condi-
tions that have been shown to be associated with
depression and mental distress in related scales across
contexts, with the aim of examining an empirical relation
(and not establishing diagnostic cut points), is likely an
appropriate approach.
CONCLUSIONS
Individual-level FI is associated with poorer mental health
outcomes across all global regions, independent of socio-
economic factors. The consistency of this association suggests
that scaling up successful FI interventions may yield benefits
to mental health outcomes across a diversity of settings.
Evaluations of interventions, however, require thoughtful
measurement of FI, explicit assessment of mental health, and
an examination of the impact pathways via which FI
components influence psychosocial conditions and experi-
ences. Components of FI that may have direct implications
for mental health status (e.g., socially unacceptable food
acquisition behaviors) are absent from common FI assess-
ment tools.53–55 Yet, culturally appropriate and valid tools are
needed to assess these behaviors. Improved monitoring and
evaluation of mental health outcomes is also needed. This is a
particular challenge in low- and middle-income countries
because nearly a quarter of these countries have no system for
reporting mental health information, and many are hindered
by lack of accountability.56 Developing robust monitoring
systems and strengthening the measurement of both FI and
mental health to more comprehensively understand their
relation across contexts may help to inform interventions that
can effectively address the mental health consequences of FI.
