 Assessment of Patient Satisfaction with Acute Pain 
Management Service: Monitoring Quality of Care in 
Clinical Setting 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Timely and effective management of acute pain has been one of the biggest 
challenges of modern medicine. About two thirds of patients admitted to hospitals still 
suffer from uncontrolled pain despiteextensive research and education vis-à-vis pain 
management.1It is also an established fact that uncontrolled pain leads to many 
deleterious effects.2Quality assurance efforts in pain management consist of methods 
to establish pain management protocols, to monitor their application, and to assess the 
benefits they provide to the patients. Quality of pain management that results from 
these efforts can be evaluated byassessment of various pain management 
outcomes;3patients‟ satisfaction being one of them.4Health care facilities routinely use 
patient satisfaction evaluations to identify methods of practiceimprovement and better 
care provision. 
 
Patient satisfaction with postoperative pain management depends upon a number of 
variables including patients‟ expectations, intensity of pain experienced, promptness 
of acute pain service response, effectiveness of treatment and health-care 
professionals‟ attitude.5The American Pain Society in Quality Assurance Standards 
(Table 1) for Relief of Acute and Cancer related pain specifies that patient satisfaction 
with pain management must be surveyed in clinical practice6 .The current study was 
conducted to monitor the quality of care provided by Acute Pain Service (APMS), to 
develop a reliable tool for assessing patient satisfaction with APMS, and to identify 
different variables affecting patient satisfaction with an aim to improve the overall 
quality of service.

Materials and Methods 
Approval for the study was grantedby institutional Ethics Review Committee (ERC). 
Data were collected over a 3-month period on 102 consecutive, adult patients, who 
were provided care by APMS and consented to participate. A questionnaire was 
designed and administered to each patient on the day of discharge, before going 
home. The questionnaire was delivered, explained to the patient and filled out by an 
independent, unbiased person who had no link with APMS. This was achieved by 
assigning this task to a medical student visiting from another medical school, and not 
known to the APMS team or patients, except for one of the authors who briefed her 
about the questionnaire. 
 
Acute Pain Management Service 
Authors‟ institute is a tertiary care hospital situated in a city riddled with violence and 
insecurity. It caters to multiple emergency situations including bomb blasts, mass 
causalities and road traffic accidents and is hence faced with a huge burden of trauma 
and injury. It also provides care to a range of complicated tertiary care surgical 
patients brought in from all parts of the country besides elective surgical patients. 
Formal Acute Pain Service has been established in the institute since 2001. It is an 
anaesthesia consultant led service where everyday care is provided by dedicated pain 
nurses and anaesthesia residents with the help of ward nurses. The service provides 
care to post-operative patients and others suffering from medical or non-surgical acute 
pain. 
Primary anesthesiologist devises the post- operative pain management plan and 
initiates its implementation in the operating room. APMS team takes over the pain 
relief responsibility of patients in the PACU, carry out regular pain assessments, 
responds and trouble shoots all problems related to acute pain management. On duty 
pain nurse and the rotating anesthesia resident conduct regular bed side rounds 3 
times in a day, more often if indicated, and report to the covering anesthesia 
consultant. In between the rounds, regular pain assessment is the duty of ward nurses, 
who pages the on duty pain nurse whenever required. Everyone uses a combination of 
Verbal rating scale and Numeric-rating scale for uniform assessment of pain scores.

 The reliability of these tools is in general high. Ward nurses as well as AMPS staff 
carry out documentation of pain scores, pain-management interventions used, and 
patient condition at regular intervals in patient‟s records. APMS also maintains 
electronic data of all the patients under its care. To ensure effectiveness and safety of 
the pain management regimes employed, APMS members regularly make 
adjustments to the originally prescribed analgesic strategies and treat side effects as 
required. APMS also provides round the clock consultative service to all patients 
suffering from acute non-surgical pain.  Besides provision of clinical care, conducting 
regular audits, satisfaction surveys, implementing quality assurance measures, giving 
regular feedbacks to all concerned, is the duty of APMS. APMS with its efforts has 
made pain visible. 
 
Instrument  
The questionnaire consisted of 2 parts: 
PartIcomprised of patient‟s demographics includingage, gender, surgical specialty, 
surgical procedure, post-operative analgesic modality and co-analgesics used. This 
part was completed from patients‟ medical records.  
 
PartII of the questionnaireincluded 10 questions (table 2). Six of these questions had 
options to respond on a 5 point Likert scale arranged from highest to lowest. Four 
questions had „yes‟ or „no‟ options while at the end, patients were encouraged to give 
their comments/opinions in an open ended manner.  
 
All statistical analysis was performed using statistical packages for social science 
version 19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Mean and standard deviation were computed for 
age, and frequency and percentages were reported for qualitative observations.

 RESULTS 
A total of 132 patients were managed by APMS during the three months of the 
survey, of which 102 agreed to participate. The average age of patients was 45.27 ± 
16.47 years. There were 55.9% female and 44.1% males. Different analgesic 
modalities were employed but majority (66.7%) received epidural analgesia. The 
analgesic modalities used and the surgical specialties are provided in table 3. For co-
analgesia, patients received paracetamol, a combination of paracetamol with tramadol 
or ketorolac.Diclofenac suppository and paracetamol were administered as co-
analgesics to patients undergoing gynaecological operations.  The expectation of 
experiencing severe pain was higher than the pain actually experienced, as shown in 
figure 1.  
 
Of the patients followed up by APMS during the study period,56.9% received 
interventions within half an hour of the call given for inadequate pain relief or 
management of side effects, 13.7% were managed within 1 hour, 2% within 1 to 2 
hours and 1% after 2 hours of the call, while 26.4 % did not require any intervention 
by APMS and were free of pain and side effects.  After interventionsby APMS, 
excellent to very good pain relief was reported by 72%of the patients, moderate pain 
relief by 25.3%, while 2.7% reported poor pain relief. Attentiveness and sensitivity of 
APMS staff was considered very good to excellent by 91% of patients, fair by 8%, 
while 1% considered the service as poor. 
 
Only 46% patients were aware that APMS is a part of anaesthesia department. The 
intention to be treated with the same analgesia modality in future and to recommend it 
to their family and friends was reported by a large majority of the patients (Table 4).  
All participants except one found APMS staff courteous and professional (Table 4). 
The overall experience with APMS was considered good to excellent by 97% of the 
patients (Fig2). The comments of the patients are presented in Table 5.

 Discussion 
The results of this study show that multimodal analgesia wasused in all patients 
included in the survey which is part of current recommendations for best analgesic 
practice.7There is a scarcity of strong opioid analgesics in our country and, even in 
centers where morphine and fentanyl are available, their supply is limited and erratic. 
In resource limited set-ups, careful selection of the available drugs and techniques is 
the best hope for provision of optimal pain relief to the patient. It has rightly been said 
that the solution to the problem of inadequacy of postoperative pain management does 
not actually lie in the acquisition of expensive medication or development and use of 
new techniques, but rather in the optimal utilization of already available drugs, 
techniques and facilities.8,9Thus, a combination of regional technique and multimodal 
analgesia, which most of our patients received, was the best available option for 
providing effective pain relief in the postoperative period. 
Campbell and colleagues define assessment of quality care as determining “whether 
individuals can access the healthcare structures and processes of care which they 
need, and whether the care received is effective”.10 One method of evaluating users‟ 
perception of a service is to assess their satisfaction with the care they receive. The 
American Pain Society in Quality Assurance Standards for Relief of Acute and 
Cancer related pain specifies that patient satisfaction with pain management must be 
surveyed in clinical practice.11Assessment of patient satisfaction is of particular 
importance if the aim is to improve service to achieve better outcomes and improved 
quality of life.12 Furthermore, a satisfied patient is said to be more likely to comply 
with the prescribed treatment 13,14and hence has a better chance of earlier recovery. 
 
Satisfaction is a subjective feeling dependent upon patients‟ past experiences and 
future expectations.15It is easy to assume that effective pain relief would correlate 
highly with patients‟ satisfaction with their pain management. However, earlier 
research has shown that patients may be highly satisfied with their pain management 
even when they have reported considerable levels of pain during their hospital 
stay.3,16-18This imposes difficulty in interpreting the results of patient satisfaction 
surveys on pain management,16-18and explanation needs to be sought for the high 
satisfaction scores even with inadequate pain relief. In our survey, even though pain

SCIENTIFIC COOPERATIONS MEDICAL WORKSHOPS
 management interventions by APMSwere required in a significant number of patients 
and 28% of the patients had moderate to poor pain relief despite the interventions, 
97% of the patients reported their overall experience regarding pain management as 
good to excellent. The response time of APMS staff and their attitude and 
attentiveness might have played a role in defining the level of patient satisfaction, 
sincemore than 70% of our patients received pain management interventions within 
one hour of the call given to APMS. Furthermore, 91% of our patients reported 
attentiveness and sensitivity of the APMS staff as very good to excellent. Thus, one of 
the reasonsfor the high rate of patient satisfaction in our study could be a professional 
and courteous attitude of APMS.Lin has provided a similar explanation for high 
satisfaction scores even with high pain levels in his patients and states that caring 
attitude of the staff may be one of the reasons for high overall satisfaction levels in 
patients suffering with pain.3 
 
Our results show that patients‟expectation of experiencing severe pain was higher 
than the pain actually experienced by them. It has been claimed that patient‟s 
expectations have a strong effect on degree of patient‟s satisfaction about an 
experience. Squiresstates that the ratio between expectations and perception of an 
experience results in the level of satisfaction for the person making the judgment.19 
The fact that majority of our patients (70.6%) expected severe pain postoperatively, 
but not as many (44%) suffered from it, could have been one of the reasons for 
majority being satisfied with the service.  
 
More than half of the patients included in the survey (54%) were not aware that 
APMS was a part of anaesthesia department. This identifies the need for conduct of 
public awareness sessions regarding pain management by dedicated acute and chronic 
pain physicians and nurses. Such sessions would make the patients aware that pain 
relief is their basic right, pain relieving medicines are accessible and who to turn to in 
case of unrelieved pain.In addition, APMS staff needs to introduce the team members 
and the service provided by them to the patients and their familiesin adequate detail 
duringAPMS rounds so that they can be traced back whenever patients need help. 
Despite the high satisfaction scores in our study, some shortcomings were 
identifiedby us, which need to be addressed with the aim of formulating and 
implementing strategies for improvement.More than 4% patients waiting for overan 
SCIENTIFIC COOPERATIONS MEDICAL WORKSHOPS 21-22 July, 2015, Istanbul - TURKEY
SCIENTIFIC COOPERATIONS MEDICAL WORKSHOPS
 hour to receive analgesia is one of the identified parameters requiring improvement. 
Similarly, at least four patients complained of severe pain on waking up from 
anaesthesia in the recovery room (Table 4), which was not addressed in a timely 
manner. This highlights the need for APMS team to make a process for timely 
provision of pain management in the recovery room and wards.Evaluation of any 
service by its providers has the potential of bringing in an element of bias. In our 
survey a medical student of another medical school was employed for data collection. 
Utilizing an evaluator, unrelated to APMS, eliminated the factor of bias and is thus a 
major strength of our study.
