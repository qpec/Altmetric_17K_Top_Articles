Abstract: 
 
Non-thermal microwave/lower frequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs) act via voltage-
gated calcium channel (VGCC) activation.  Calcium channel blockers block EMF effects 
and several types of additional evidence confirm this mechanism.  Low intensity 
microwave EMFs have been proposed to produce neuropsychiatric effects, sometimes 
called microwave syndrome, and the focus of this review is whether these are indeed well 
documented and consistent with the known mechanism(s) of action of such EMFs.  
VGCCs occur in very high densities throughout the nervous system and have near 
universal roles in release of neurotransmitters and neuroendocrine hormones.  Soviet and 
Western literature shows that much of the impact of non-thermal microwave exposures in 
experimental animals occurs in the brain and peripheral nervous system, such that 
nervous system histology and function show diverse and substantial changes.  These may 
be generated through roles of VGCC activation, producing excessive 
neurotransmitter/neuroendocrine release as well as oxidative/nitrosative stress and other 
responses.  Excessive VGCC activity has been shown from genetic polymorphism studies 
to have roles in producing neuropsychiatric changes in humans.  Two U.S. government 
reports from the 1970’s-80’s provide evidence for many neuropsychiatric effects of non-
thermal microwave EMFs, based on occupational exposure studies.  18 more recent 
epidemiological studies, provide substantial evidence that microwave EMFs from 
cell/mobile phone base stations, excessive cell/mobile phone usage and from wireless 
smart meters can each produce similar patterns of neuropsychiatric effects, with several 
of these studies showing clear dose-response relationships.  Lesser evidence from 6 
additional studies suggests that short wave, radio station, occupational and digital TV 
antenna exposures may produce similar neuropsychiatric effects.  Among the more 
commonly reported changes are sleep disturbance/insomnia, headache, 
depression/depressive symptoms, fatigue/tiredness,dysesthesia, concentration/attention 
dysfunction, memory changes, dizziness, irritability,  loss of appetite/body weight,  
restlessness/anxiety, nausea, skin burning/tingling/dermographism and EEG changes.  In 
summary, then, the mechanism of action of microwave EMFs, the role of the VGCCs in 
the brain, the impact of non-thermal EMFs on the brain, extensive epidemiological 
studies performed over the past 50 years, and five criteria testing for causality, all 
collectively show that various non-thermal microwave EMF exposures produce diverse 
neuropsychiatric effects.

Introduction: 
 
Microwave syndrome (Hocking, 2001; Johnson Liakouris, 1998), a combination of 
various neuropsychiatric symptoms originally described in persons with occupational 
exposures to microwave frequency EMFs, has been disputed largely because of the lack 
of an apparent mechanism for generating these symptoms.  It is reported to often include 
such symptoms as fatigue, headache, insomnia, dysesthesia (impaired sensation), 
irritability, lack of concentration and other symptoms (Hocking, 2001; Johnson 
Liakouris, 1998).    Similar but more extensive combinations of symptoms have been 
reported following occupational exposures in two U.S. government reports from the 
1970s/1980s (Naval Medical Research Institute Research Report, 1971; Raines, 1981) 
and following environmental exposures as described in two more recent reviews 
(Khurana et al, 2010; Levitt and Lai, 2010).   
 
The goal here is not just to review the epidemiology, however, but more importantly to 
consider the issue of possible physiological mechanism(s). Hennekens and Buring 
(1989), on p. 40 in their textbook Epidemiology in Medicine state "The belief in the 
existence of a cause and effect relationship is enhanced if there is a known or postulated 
biologic mechanism by which the exposure might reasonably alter risk of developing 
disease."  It is of critical importance therefore to assess possible biological mechanism 
before considering the epidemiological evidence. 
 
Accordingly, this paper considers the mechanism by which low intensity microwave 
EMFs impact the cells of our bodies, how that mechanism may be predicted to impact the 
nervous system, evidence for such impact from experimental animal studies, genetic 
polymorphism evidence for that mechanism acting in humans to produce 
neuropsychiatric effects and finally, the epidemiological evidence for such effects in 
human populations with repeated low level microwave EMF exposure.  Consideration of 
each of these types of evidence influences the overall interpretation presented in this 
paper.   
 
Microwave/lower frequency EMFs act to activate voltage-gated calcium channels 
 
In 24 different studies reviewed earlier (Pall, 2013) and two additional studies (Li et al, 
2014; Lisi et al, 2006), microwave and lower frequency low intensity EMF effects were 
blocked or greatly lowered by calcium channel blockers, agents thought to be specific for 
blocking voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs).  In these 26 studies, a total of 5

3 
distinct types of channel blockers were used, with each type having a distinct structure 
and binding to a distinct site, such that it is essentially certain that these must be acting by 
blocking VGCCs, which is their only known common property.  In each of these 26 
studies, each of the responses studied, were blocked or greatly lowered by calcium 
channel blockers, showing that VGCC activation has roles in producing a wide variety of 
EMF effects.  There is a large literature on changes in calcium fluxes and in calcium 
signaling following microwave EMF exposure (partially reviewed in Walleczek 1992; 
Adey 1993);  each of these, including calcium efflux changes, can be explained as being 
due to VGCC activation, again suggesting a widespread role of VGCC activation in 
producing biological responses to EMFs.  Pilla (2012) showed that pulsed microwave 
field exposure, produced an almost instantaneous increase in calcium/calmodulin-
dependent nitric oxide (NO) signaling, providing strong evidence that these fields can 
produce an almost instantaneous VGCC activation.  It is likely, that these EMFs act 
directly on the voltage sensor of the VGCCs to produce VGCC activation (Pall, 2015) 
with the voltage sensor being exquisitely sensitive to these EMFs because of its physical 
properties and location in the plasma membrane. 
 
EMFs have been proposed to act to produce a wide variety of responses in the cell, via 
downstream effects of VGCC activation (Pall, 2013, 2014, 2015), including elevated 
intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i, excessive calcium and nitric oxide signaling and also 
excessive peroxynitrite, free radicals and oxidative stress.   
 
VGCC activation has been shown to have a universal or near-universal role in the release 
of neurotransmitters in the brain and also in the release of hormones by neuroendocrine 
cells (Berridge, 1998; Dunlap et al, 1995; Wheeler et al, 1994), with such release being 
produced by calcium signaling.  There are high densities of diverse VGCCs occuring in 
neurons throughout the nervous system.  Both the high VGCC density and their function 
in neurotransmitter and neuroendocrine release throughout the nervous system suggests 
that the nervous system is likely to be highly sensitive to low intensity EMFs. 
 
Genetic Polymorphism Studies 
 
Genetic polymorphism studies are powerful tools for looking at the roles of specific 
proteins in human populations.  In Table 1, a series of genetic polymorphism studies have 
been performed that show that an allele producing increased expression of the gene 
encoding the channel of the main L-type VGCC in the brain, produces diverse 
neuropsychiatric effects.  These studies clearly show that excess L-type VGCC activity 
can cause neuropsychiatric effects.  They also predict, therefore, that increased VGCC 
activity produced by microwave EMFs may be able to also produce widespread 
neuropsychiatric effects.

Histological and Functional Changes in Central Nervous System (CNS) and Peripheral 
Nervous System ((PNS) in Animals Exposed to Microwave EMFs 
 
The most extensive literature on histological and functional changes in animals is from 
the Soviet literature from the 1950s/1960s with additional Western literature from the 
same time period.  Both Soviet and non-Soviet literature were reviewed in an English 
language Publication by Tolgskaya and Gordon (1973).  This publication is, therefore, 
the main focus of this section.  That publication was divided into thermal and non-

thermal exposure studies, with the non-thermal studies which occupy the majority of the 
text (pp. 53-137) being of sole interest here.   
 
 
 
Table 2  Histological and Functional Changes in Brain Function in Animals 
following  Exposure to Non-Thermal Microwave EMFs 
 
Observations including page numbers 
Comment from Author 
The majority of the histological changes seen following 
non-thermal exposures, occurred in the nervous system, 
despite its being only about 2% of the tissue mass in 
rodents; this suggests that the nervous system is highly 
sensitive to such exposures.  Elsewhere (p.129,136), it 
is suggested that the nervous system is the most 
sensitive tissue, followed by the heart and the testis, 
among all of the tissues of the body.  The most severe 
histological changes produced by these non-thermal 
EMF exposures occur in the nervous system (p. 136). 
High CNS sensitivity to EMFs 
is predicted by the high density 
of VGCCs that occur in 
neurons throughout the 
nervous system, plus the 
VGCC role in neurotransmitter 
and neuroendocrine release. 
Pulsed fields were more active than non-pulsed fields 
in producing histological changes (p. 71,97) 
Pulsed fields have often been 
found to be more biologically 
active than are non-pulsed 
fields in many different studies 
from many countries (Pall, 
2015, Panagopoulos et al, 
2013; Belyaev, 2015) 
Nervous system regions impacted by non-thermal 
microwave and lower frequency fields include:  cortex, 
diencephalon including the hypothalamus and 
thalamus, hippocampus, autonomic ganglia, sensory 
fibers, pituitary gland including neurohypophysis 
 
Neuroendocrine changes seem to undergo change over 
increased time of exposure.  Neurosecretion in the 
hypothalamus and in the pituitary each go through a 
complex sequence over time, where EMF exposure 
initially produces increased hormone secretion but 
where over time, the neurosecretory cells become 
“exhausted”, leading to lowered secretion and in some 
cases cell death (pp.77-96). 
Elevated [Ca2+]i stimulates 
hormone secretion.  However 
when such elevated [Ca2+]i 
occurs over extended time 
periods it is highly damaging 
to the cell, leading in some 
cases to apoposis; thus this 
time course of action should 
not be surprising. 
Histological changes include boutons/argyrophilia, 
smaller neurons, vacuole formation in neuroendocrine 
cells, bead-like thickening along dendrites 
(p.66,70,71,73,97,98,100,111,115-117,121-125).  
Spines near the ends of dendrites become deformed and

entirely (p.70).  Sensory neurons, following exposures, 
developed changes characteristic of irritation, with 
“marked tortuosity of the nerve fibers.”  Many 
histological changes are seen in the hypothalamic cells 
(p.87-92) as their neuroendocrine function becomes 
impacted.  Histological changes were found even with 
exposures that produced no apparent functional 
changes. 
Many histological and functional changes are reported 
to initially be reversible, following cessation of 
exposure, but progressively become irreversible with 
longer exposure. (p.64,72,74).  Paralleling the 
development of irreversibility, it is found that 
“Repeated exposure leads to gradual increase in 
severity of observed changes.” … including 
“increasingly severe disturbance of conditioned reflex 
activity in the animals, changes in responses of  
animals particularly sensitive to acoustic stimulation… 
.” (p. 104)  
If this is also true in humans, 
then claims that there cannot 
be non-thermal effects, claims 
which act to prolong 
exposures, may be causing 
irreversible damage to many 
humans. 
EEG changes (p. 55,60,102), including seizure activity 
following sensory provocation  
Lai, 1997 has an extensive 
review of EEG changes in 
animals following non-thermal 
microwave EMF exposures 
Neurodegeneration is reported in a number of places in 
this review (p.72,83,117). 
 
Synaptic connections in regions of the brain are 
disrupted (p.65-74, 97,113,121,136), and at the 
extreme, some neurons are completely asynaptic (p.73). 
Synaptic connections are 
known to be disrupted in 
autism; could this suggest that 
autism may be generated by 
EMF exposure?  No doubt, we 
need much more evidence on 
this. 
“after prolonged and repeated irradiation with low-
intensity centimeter waves, with no elevation of the 
body temperature and when the animal’s condition 
remained satisfactory, changes were nevertheless found 
in the sensory fibers of the skin and viscera in the form 
of irritation phenomena.  These findings concur with 
the view in the literature that the receptor system as a 
whole and, in particular its preterminal portions are 
highly sensitive.” P.76.  This description is similar to 
what is reported to occur in electromagnetic 
hypersensitivity (EHS).  Other such studies are 
described and include cumulative changes over time, 
that may also explain changes reported in EHS 
(p.75,99,100,104). 
One wonders whether almost 
60 years ago, the Soviet 
literature may have already 
described a possible animal 
model for EHS.  None is 
known to exist today, and 
because of that, EHS studies 
are severely constrained.  
Clearly one needs to be 
skeptical about this 
interpretation, but it is of great 
importance that this be further 
studied.

These were all derived from the Tolgskaya and Gordon,1973 review and page numbers 
listed are page numbers from that document.  All refer to changes produced by non-
thermal exposures in the nervous system of experimental animals, with most being in 
rats. 
 
This discussion scrolls down through Table 2.   
 
The majority of the histological changes seen in these mostly rodent studies, are seen in 
the nervous system, despite its being less than 2% of the rodent cell mass.  There are 
statements made that the nervous system, both central and peripheral, is the most highly 
sensitive tissue to these non-thermal microwave and lower frequency EMFs.  Following 
the nervous system in sensitivity are the myocardium and the testis; myocardial cells are 
known to have very high densities of VGCCs with especially high densities in the 
pacemaker cells and the testis is known to have high densities specifically of the T-type 
VGCCs.  Pulsed EMFs are more active in producing histological changes in the brain 
than are non-pulsed fields, in two studies reviewed; there is a much larger literature 
showing that in most cases pulsed fields are more biologically active (Pall, 2015, 
Panagopoulos et al, 2013, Belyaev, 2015). 
 
A wide variety of brain and peripheral nervous system tissues show histological changes 
following non-thermal exposures.   Among the important tissues impacted are the 
hypothalamus and pituitary gland, where both show similar patterns of changes in 
neuroendocrine activities.  There Is an initial increase in neuroendocrine activity (this 
may be produced directly by VGCC stimulation of secretion), followed over time by 
“exhaustion” of neuroendocrine activity (this may be produced by tissue damage 
produced from long term intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i  elevation).   
 
There are widespread histological changes produced in neuronal and neuroendocrine 
tissues.  These were repeatedly reported to be largely reversible on cessation of EMF 
exposure.  They become, however, irreversible when exposure is extended in time.  There 
are changes in EEG activity, which may be an easily measurable monitor of neurological 
damage.   
 
In a summary statement, Tolgskaya and Gordon, 1973 state “This does not confirm the 
view,so widely held in the past among Soviet investigators and still maintained to a large 
extent even at the present time in the West, that the action of microwaves is entirely 
thermal.” 
 
While there were many studies of brain impact of non-thermal EMFs performed in the 
1950s/60s that make the information content of Tolgskaya and Gordon, 1973 quite high, 
there is also a substantial recent literature on brain effects of non-thermal microwave 
EMF exposures (see, for example:  Ammari et al, 2008a; Ammari et al, 2008b; Bas et al, 
2009; Brillaud et al, 2007; Carballo-Quintás, et al, 2011; Eberhardt et al, 2008; Dasdag et 
al, 2009 & 2012; Grafström et al, 2008; Kumlin et al, 2007; López-Martín, 2006; 
Mausset-Bonnefont et al, 2004; Odacia et al, 2008; Rağbetli, et al, 2010; Salford et al,

Older Epidemiological Reviews and Other Related Studies 
 
Two U.S. Government reports each listed many apparent neuropsychiatric effects of 
microwave/radiofrequency EMFs and a third recognized the role of non-thermal effects 
on our bodies, but had only a little consideration of neuropsychiatric effects.   
 
The earliest to these was a Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) Research Report 
(1971) which listed 40 apparent neuropsychiatric changes produced by non-thermal 
exposures:, including 5 central/peripheral nervous system (NS) changes, 9 CNS effects, 4 
autonomic system effects, 17 psychological disorders, 4 behavioral changes and 2 misc. 
effects. This NMRI report also provided a supplementary document listing over 2300 
citations documenting these and other effects of microwave exposures in humans and in 
animals.  
 
The Raines (1981) NASA report reviewed extensive literature based on occupational 
exposures to non-thermal microwave EMFs, with that literature coming from U.S., 
Western European and Eastern European studies.  There are no obvious differences in the 
literature coming from these different regions.  Based on multiple studies, Raines (1981) 
reports 19 neuropsychiatric effects to be associated with occupational 
microwave/radiofrequency EMFs.  
 
The Bolen (1994) report put out by the Rome Laboratory of the U.S. Air Force, 
acknowledged the role of non-thermal effects of microwave EMFs on humans.  This 
report states in the Conclusion section that “Experimental evidence has shown that 
exposure to low intensity radiation can have a profound effect on biological processes.  
The nonthermal effects of RF/MW radiation exposure are becoming important measures 
of biological interaction of EM fields.” Clearly Bolen (1994) rejects the claim that only 
thermal effects occur. Bolen (1994) discusses a specific non-thermal neuropsychiatric 
effect, where anesthetized animals are awakened when the head is irradiated with 
microwave EMFs.  This suggests a similar mechanism to that acting in humans where 
such EMFs produce insomnia (see below).   
 
Specific Epidemiological Studies on Neuropsychiatric Effects of Microwave EMFs 
 
There are 26 different epidemiological studies described in Table 3.  Although 4 of these 
only studied a single neuropsychiatric effect, 22 of these each provide substantial 
evidence for the pattern described in the earlier U.S. reports, that a wide range of 
neuropsychiatric effects are produced by exposure to various non-thermal microwave 
frequency EMFs.  Perhaps the most important of these 26 is the Santini et al, 2003 study 
of people living near cell phone base stations.

There are three recent studies on the generation of headache during or shortly following 
long mobile phone calls (listed under Chu et al, 2011 in Table 3).  The timing of 
development of these headaches and the finding that they occur on the ipsilateral side of 
the head, the side receiving much higher EMF exposure during the call, both argue 
strongly that these headaches are caused by the long mobile phone calls.  Such causality 
was concluded earlier by Frey, 1998 based on earlier studies and is now still more 
strongly documented. 
 
Criteria for Assessing Causality In Epidemiological Studies 
 
It is important to consider the different criteria that allow one to judge whether a cause 
and effect relationship is justified by the studies listed in Table 3 and the individual 
studies cited in Raines, 1981.  There are five such criteria that should be considered in 
making that judgment (See pp.39-43 in Hennington and Buring, 1987): 
 
Strength of Association:  Is there a strong correlation between exposure and the 
neuropsychiatric symptoms?  There clearly is for several studies cited in Raines, 1981.  
One example is the Dwyer and Leeper, 1978 study (see Table 3) where there is a large 
increase in symptoms and where that increase is greater with longer occupational 
exposure.   Another example is the Lerner, 1980 study of 1300 microwave workers, 
where workers with relatively low exposure levels had an approximate doubling of 
neurological complaints and where those with substantially higher exposure levels had an 
approximate tripling of neurological complaints over controls.  Sadcikova, 1974 found 
that 7 of 8 neuropsychiatric symptoms studied, showed a statistically significant rise in 
prevalence with longer occupational exposure (see Table 3).  Sadcikova, 1974, also found 
that microwave workers had increases of 3 to over 10-fold in:  feeling of heaviness in the 
head; tiredness; irritability; sleepiness; partial loss of memory; and skin sensitivity.  
There is also a strong association where important new exposures occur – this is clearly 
the case with all of the studies of people living near cell/mobile phone base stations, 
listed in Table 3 and also with the two studies of people who become exposed to radiation 
from smart meters.  The studies listed in Table 3 under Chu et al, 2011 (see also Chia et 
al, 2000; Oftedal et al 2000) are of a special type.  Here people making very long (over 1 
h.) cell/mobile phone calls develop headaches an hour or more following the initiation of 
the long call.  So these occur within a specific time range following initiation of these 
long calls, such that headache would only occur very infrequently in that time frame by 
chance.  So here again, there is a strong association.  While there is no question that many 
of these studies show high strength of association, it is also clear that it is becoming 
progressively more difficult to do these studies.  As exposures become almost universal 
in countries around the world, it is getting difficult if not impossible to find good negative 
controls.  There may be a similar problem in doing animal studies, such that it may be 
necessary to raise animals in Faraday cages in order to avoid exposures that would 
otherwise occur as a consequence of our near ubiquitous EMFs. 
 
Biological credibility is extremely strong here, with three aspects of the biology 
predicting that these low intensity fields cause widespread neuropsychiatric effects.  This 
was discussed above and is reconsidered in the following section.

Consistency within the different epidemiological studies and with other types of studies:  
The epidemiological studies listed in Table 3 and also those showing neuropsychiatric 
effects that were cited in Raines, 1981 have been performed in many different countries 
with different cultures.  They have been performed in multiple countries in Western 
Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and in East Asia, as well as in the U.S. and 
Australia.  They are, therefore, not limited to one or two cultural contexts.  This is 
deemed, therefore, an important indicator of causality.  We also have a surprising 
consistency of apparent neuropsychiatric effects of different fields, including various 
occupational exposures and exposures to cell/mobile phone base stations, exposure to the 
phones themselves, exposure to smart meter pulses, and other EMFs (see Table 3).  
Pulsation patterns, frequencies and exact intensities may produce various biological 
responses (Pall, 2015, Panagopoulos et al, 2013, Belyaev, 2015) so it is a bit surprising 
that we have as much consistency as we do have across different types of exposures.  We 
also have consistency with the biology discussed in the previous section.  Because 
elevated VGCC activity produced by genetic polymorphism (Table 1) produces diverse 
neuropsychiatric effects, it is not surprising that elevation of VGCC activity produced by 
microwave EMF exposure apparently also produces diverse neuropsychiatric effects.  
Similarly because non-thermal EMF exposures produce widespread changes in brain 
structure and function in animals (Tolgskaya and Gordon, 1973), it is not surprising that 
the neuropsychiatric symptoms, which are produced as a consequence of brain 
dysfunction are produced by such EMFs. 
 
Time sequence:  It is clear that the all of these effects follow exposure in the various 
studies that have been published.  In some studies, it is also clear that longer occupational 
exposure times produce increased symptom prevalence.  These include Dwyer and 
Leeper, 1978 and Baranski and Edelwejn, 1975.  These observations all support a causal 
relationship between exposure to EMF and the development of neuropsychiatric 
symptoms. 
 
Dose-response relationship:  It is assumed, here, that biological effects have a positive 
correlation with the intensity of the apparent causal stressor.  This is not necessarily true 
of EMF effects, because it has been shown that there are “window effects” where specific 
intensities have larger biological effects, than do either lower or higher intensities (Pall, 
2015, Panagopoulos et al, 2013, Belyaev, 2015).  Nevertheless, where different 
intensities were studied in these epidemiological studies, they do show the dose-response 
relationship assumed here including Altpeter et al, 2000; Dwyer and Leeper, 1978; Eger 
and Jahn, 2003; Lerner, 1978; Navarro et al, 2003; Oberfeld et al, 2004; Salama et al, 
2004; Santini et al, 2003; Thomée et al, 2011.  Thus these data do fit well to the assumed 
dose-response relationship, found in most causal roles.  The Altpeter et al, 2000 study 
showed a special type of evidence for causality: during a 3-day period when the 
broadcasting tower was turned off, the melatonin levels recovered to near-normal levels.  
The studies of headache occurrence on prolonged cell/mobile phone calls (typically well 
over one hour) listed under Chu et al, 2011 in Table 3 also suggest the assumed dose-
response relationship (see also Chia et al, 2000; Oftedal et al 2000 and earlier citations 
listed in Frey, 1998).  Because such headaches only occur with prolonged cell/mobile 
 Page 14 of 25

14 
phone calls, these studies also provide evidence for a dose-response relationship because 
low doses are ineffective.  Furthermore these same studies provide evidence for such a 
dose-response relationship from another type of observation.  Because the headaches 
occur predominantly on the ipsilateral side of the head which receives much higher EMF 
exposure intensity, rather than on the contralateral side of the head, which receives much 
lower intensities, this provides an additional type of evidence for the predicted dose-
response relationship. 
 
While the evidence is convincing that the various neuropsychiatric apparent 
consequences of microwave EMF exposure are in fact caused by such exposures, there 
may be somewhat more controversy about another EMF-neuropsychiatric linkage.  Havas 
et al (2010) have reported a similar list of neuropsychiatric symptoms in electromagnetic 
hypersensitivity (EHS) patients.  They found that each of the following symptoms were 
common in EHS:  poor short term memory; difficulty of concentration; eye problems; 
sleep disorder; feeling unwell; headache; dizziness; tinnitus; chronic fatigue; tremors; 
body pain; difficulty speaking; tingling sensation in feet or hands; difficulty writing; 
difficulty walking; migraine.  The similarity of these symptoms to the most commonly 
found symptoms following non-thermal microwave EMF exposures (Table 3), suggests 
that EHS is a genuine sensitivity to EMFs.  In the bottom row in Table 2, sensitivities 
were found in rodent studies following non-thermal exposure, that suggest a possible 
animal model for the study of EHS.  Each of these EHS-related issues needs to be 
followed up experimentally.   
 
Discussion and Conclusions: 
 
In the previous section, each of the five criteria for assessing whether an epidemiological 
association is causal were considered.  Those five are (Hennekens and Buring, 1989):  1. 
Strength of association; 2. Biological credibility; 3. Consistency; 4. Time sequence; 5. 
Dose-response relationship.  Each of these five provide strong support for causality such 
that the combination of all five provide compelling evidence for causality.  Low-intensity 
microwave frequency EMFs do cause diverse neuropsychiatric symptoms.  While each of 
these five is important here, the one that is most important is the criterion of biological 
credibility. 
 
Three related sets of biological observations each predict that low-intensity microwave 
EMFs produce widespread neuropsychiatric effects: 
 
1. Such EMFs act via activation of VGCCs, acting through the VGCC voltage 
sensor which is predicted to be exquisitely sensitive to these EMFs (Pall, 2015).  
VGCCs occur in high densities throughout the nervous system and have essential 
roles throughout the nervous system in releasing neurotransmitters and 
neuroendocrine hormones. These properties predict, therefore, that these low 
intensity non-thermal microwave EMFs cause widespread changes in the nervous 
system, causing, in turn, diverse neuropsychiatric effects. 
2. Elevated VGCC activity, produced by an allele of the CACNA1C gene which 
encodes the channel of the main L-type VGCC in the brain, produces various 
 Page 15 of 25

15 
neuropsychiatric effects (Table 1).  This predicts, that low intensity non-thermal 
microwave frequency EMFs which also produce elevated L-type and other VGCC 
activity, therefore produce widespread neuropsychiatric effects.   
3. Studies reviewed in the Tolgskaya and Gordon, 1973 publication (Table 2) have 
shown that the cells of the mammalian nervous system show high sensitivity to 
various non-thermal microwave and lower frequency EMFs, being apparently 
more sensitive than any other organ in the body of rodents.  These studies predict 
that the human nervous system is likely to be similarly sensitive to these EMFs, 
predicting, therefore, widespread neuropsychiatric effects in humans. 
 
We not only have biological credibility but more importantly, each of these distinct but 
interrelated biological considerations predicts that low-intensity, non-thermal microwave 
EMFs produce widespread neuropsychiatric effects.   That common prediction is verified 
by extensive data summarized in citations provided by the Naval Medical Research 
Institute Research Report, June 1971, data provided by The Raines, 1981 NASA report, 
and by 26 epidemiological studies summarized in Table 3. 
 
The most commonly reported neuropsychiatric symptoms from these studies are 
summarized in Table. 4.

A total of 22 different studies described in Table 3 were used for data for this table, but 
not 4 others that only assessed a single neuropsychiatric end point.  The Altpeter study 
which only assessed sleep disturbance/melatonin depletion and the three studies listed 
under Chu et al which only assessed headache occurrence following long cell phone calls, 
listed in Table 3 were not included.  Because many of the studies only assessed from 3 to 
7 specific symptoms, it is not surprising that the numbers of studies reporting a specific 
 Page 16 of 25

16 
symptom fall far below 22.  Where several symptom descriptions were included under 
one heading, such as dysesthesia, if a study had more than one of these symptom 
descriptions, it was only counted once.   
 
All the symptoms listed in Table 4 should be considered established parts of microwave 
syndrome (Hocking, 2001; Johnson Liakouris, 1998).  Even if the statistical significance 
in each study was of the lowest statistical significance (p<.05) one would expect only 1 
positive study to occur at random out of the 22 studies included here.  Because many 
individual symptoms were not surveyed in many individual studies, the expectation is 
substantially lower than that.  Each of these, having shown positive results in 5 or more 
studies, are highly unlikely, therefore, to have occurred by chance.  Stong statistical 
significance is also seen for individual neuropsychiatric effects reported to have p<0.001 
in the Eger and Jahn, 2010 and Otto et al, 1994 studies (see Table 3). 
 
EEG changes may well be part of microwave syndrome, as well.  While none of the 
studies described in Table 3 measured EEGs, six studies of human occupational exposure 
cited in the Raines, 1981 showed EEG changes (Baranski and Edelwejn, 1975; Bise, 
1978; Dumanskij and Shandala, 1974; Lerner, 1980; Hauf and Weisinger, 1973; 
Sheppard and Eisenbud,1977).   Murbach et al, 2014 cited 10 human studies in support of 
their statement that “The most consistently reported effects (of mobile phone use) in 
various studies conducted by different laboratories are changes in the 
electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectrum.”  Three recent studies (Lustenberger et al, 
2013; Schmid et al, 2012a,b) and several earlier studies cited in Wagner et al (1998) have 
each shown EEG changes in sleeping humans exposed to non-thermal pulsed microwave 
fields.  Two recent studies showed EEG changes in persons exposed to Wi-Fi fields 
(Maganioti, 2010; Papageorgiou, 2011).  Lai, 1997 described 8 animal studies showing 
changes in EEG patterns in animals exposed to non-thermal EMFs and three additional 
animal studies were described in Tolgskaya and Gordon, 1973.  With the exception of the 
6 studies cited in the second sentence in this paragraph, all of these are direct 
experimental studies which are not, therefore, susceptible to the questions of causality 
that can be raised about epidemiological studies.  It is the author’s view that future 
studies should consider studying EEG changes as an objectively measurable assessment 
of brain physiology and that before and after increased exposure studies should be 
considered when a new EMF source is to be introduced into human populations.  While 
such studies must be done carefully, given the complexity of EEGs, even very small 
numbers of individuals may produce highly statistically significant results in well 
designed studies analyzed with paired t-tests. 
 
One of the citations from the previous paragraph, Bise, 1978 reviewed earlier studies of 
low level microwave frequency exposures in humans and concluded that such EMFs 
produced the following neuropsychiatric effects:  headache, fatigue, irritability, dizziness, 
loss of appetite, sleepiness, sweating, difficulty of concentration, memory loss, 
depression, emotional instability, dermographism, tremor, hallucinations and insomnia.  
The strong similarity of this list from 37 years ago and the list in Table 4 should be noted.  
The Bise, 1978 list is based on occupational exposure studies whereas the current list in 
Table 4 is based primarily on EMF exposures from cell/mobile phone base stations, from 
 Page 17 of 25

17 
heavy cell phone usage and from smart meters, three types of exposures that did not exist 
in 1978.  The strong similarity between the Bise, 1978 list and the current one 37 years 
later alone produces a compelling argument that the 11 neuropsychiatric effects found on 
both lists are caused by exposure to multiple types of low-intensity microwave EMFs.  
 
The pattern of evidence is compelling in support of the earlier statement of Levitt and Lai 
(2010) that “The primary questions now involve specific exposure parameters, not the 
reality of complaints or attempts to attribute such complaints to psychosomatic causes, 
malingering or beliefs in paranormal phenomena.” 
 
We can barely imagine how the combinations of neuropsychiatric effects, including those 
in Table 4, will influence human behavior and social interactions, now that the majority 
of the human populations on earth are exposed to ever increasing intensities and diversity 
of microwave frequency EMFs.  You may recall that three of the occupational exposure 
studies cited in (Raines, 1981 showed increasing prevalence of neuropsychiatric 
symptoms with years of exposure to consistent patterns of EMF exposure intensities 
(Dwyer and Leeper, 1978, Sadcikova, 1974 and Baranski and Edelwejn, 1975).  With 
ever increasing exposures in human populations, we have no idea what the consequences 
of these ever increasing exposures will be.

Highlights: 
 
� 
Microwave EMFs activate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) concentrated in 
the brain 
 
� 
Animal studies show such low level MWV EMFs have diverse high impacts in 
the brain 
 
� 
VGCC activity causes widespread neuropsychiatric effects in humans (genetic 
studies) 
 
� 
26 studies have EMFs assoc. with neuropsychiatric effects; 5 criteria show 
causality 
 
� 
MWV EMFs cause at least 13 neuropsychiatric effects including depression in 
humans
