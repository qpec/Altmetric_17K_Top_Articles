Abstract: 
Study Objectives: To document trends in self-reported sleep duration for the non-institutionalized 
U.S. civilian population from 2004-2017 and examine how sleep trends vary by race/ethnicity. 
Methods: We use data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) for U.S. non-
institutionalized adults aged 18-84 from 2004 to 2017 (N=398,382).  NHIS respondents were 
asked how much they slept in a 24-hour period on average, which we categorized as: ≤6 hours 
(short-sleep), 7-8 hours (adequate-sleep), and ≥9 hours (long-sleep). We used multinomial 
logistic regression models to examine trends in self-reported sleep duration and assess 
race/ethnic differences in these trends. Our models statistically adjusted for demographic, 
socioeconomic, familial, behavioral, and health covariates. 
Results: The prevalence of short sleep duration was relatively stable from 2004-2012. However, 
results from multinomial logistic regression models indicated there was an increasing trend 
toward short sleep beginning in 2013 (b: 0.09, 95% CI: 0.05-0.14) that continued through 2017 
(b: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.13-0.23). This trend was significantly more pronounced among Hispanics 
and non-Hispanic blacks, which resulted in widening racial/ethnic differences in reports of short 
sleep.  
Conclusions: Recent increases in reports of short sleep are concerning as short sleep has been 
linked with a number of adverse health outcomes in the population. Moreover, growing 
race/ethnic disparities in short sleep may have consequences for racial and ethnic health 
disparities.

Statement of Significance 
Inadequate sleep remains a public health concern. Recent social, economic, and technological 
changes may have increased the risk of inadequate sleep for the U.S. adult population and 
especially for racial/ethnic minorities. Using data from the 2004-2017 National Health Interview 
Survey, we document self-reported sleep duration trends for the U.S. adult population and by 
race/ethnicity after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral health covariates. 
We find increasing reports of short sleep duration from 2013-2017 driven primarily by 
increasing short sleep among black and Hispanic adults. These trends are worrisome as they 
could exacerbate racial/ethnic health inequalities. Future research should examine how societal-
level changes in the economy and technology are related to trends in short sleep duration among 
U.S. adults.

Introduction 
Sufficient sleep is essential for daily functioning as well as physical and mental well-
being. Short sleep duration, often defined as less than seven hours, is associated with obesity,1 
decreased cognitive functioning,2 dementia,3 heart disease,4 diabetes,5 and mortality.6,7 About 
one third of Americans report experiencing short sleep according to estimates from the 2014 
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.8 The importance of sleep for health has generated 
considerable interest in determining if sleep duration has changed over time, but research 
findings have been mixed.9 Studies using daily time use data document a decreasing prevalence 
of short sleep in the U.S. adult population from the 1980s to the mid-2000s,10 but also find an 
increase in short sleep among full-time workers.11 Much of the research linking sleep to health is 
based on studies of self-reported habitual sleep duration. One study of self-reported sleep 
duration found a decline in sleep duration from the 1980s to the early 2000s, but very little 
change from 2004 to 2012,12 while another study found an increase in short sleep among some 
workers between 2004 and 2007.13 Although one study using daily time diary data has reported 
an increase in sleep duration from 2003 to 2016,14 trends in reported sleep since 2012 have yet to 
be examined.

Social, economic, and technological changes in recent years, however, may have resulted 
in a decline in sleep duration among U.S. adults. For example, the recent recession led to housing 
loss, increased financial stress,15,16 and a restructured labor market that included more precarious 
work,17 factors which are associated with shorter sleep. 18–20 Additionally, there was a rapid rise 
in smart phones and tablets over this five-year period; the number of Americans with a smart 
phone increased from 35% in 2011 to 77% in 2016.21 Americans now spend more time looking 
at a screen, and, due to the mobile nature of these devices, technology has increasingly entered 
the bedroom.22,23 Technology use, especially smart phones, has been linked to inadequate and 
poor sleep24 as well as daytime sleepiness.25 Finally, Americans have reported increased levels of 
extreme stress in recent years,26 and researchers have found a robust association between stress 
and poor sleep outcomes.27,28 These changes may have had consequences for recent secular 
trends in reported sleep duration and we expect the reported prevalence of short sleep has 
increased in the population in recent years. 
Importantly, these social, economic, and technological trends may disproportionately 
impact the sleep of racial/ethnic minority populations that are already at greater risk for short 
sleep.29 Non-Hispanic black (hereafter black(s)) and Hispanic adults, for instance, tend to report 
shorter sleep than non-Hispanic white adults30,31 (hereafter white(s)) and these disparities may 
have widened following the recent recession, which had larger negative impacts on the economic 
wellbeing of black and Hispanic adults compared to their white counterparts.32 Furthermore, 
racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to experience race-related discrimination and 
vigilance, which have been linked to poor sleep.33 Though reports of generalized stress have 
increased among all U.S. adults, this is particularly true with respect to heightened stress due to 
police violence towards minorities,34 suggesting a potential race-based stressor for sleep. In

addition, researchers have found that the negative influence of screen time on children’s sleep 
duration is significantly stronger among blacks and Hispanics.35 Increasing use of mobile 
technology and social media could also differentially impact the sleep duration of racial and 
ethnic minority adults. Prior research using longitudinal data from the Alameda County Study 
found a much larger increase in reported short sleep duration among black and Hispanic adults 
compared to white adults from the 1960s through the 1990s. 36 We know little, however, about 
how reported sleep duration may have changed in more recent years across racial/ethnic groups 
in the United States.  
This study examines trends in self-reported sleep duration from 2004 to 2017 and how 
these trends vary by race/ethnicity. Given recent major social, economic, and technological 
changes, we hypothesize that the proportion of U.S. adults reporting short sleep has increased 
since 2012, and that this increase has been larger for black and Hispanic adults. 
Methods 
Data 
We used data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS),37 a nationally 
representative sample of the non-institutionalized U.S. population, that includes annual 
interviews from tens of thousands of Americans. To compare our results with prior studies12 and 
to explicitly examine when, if at all, risk for short sleep increased, we used data from 2004 
through 2017.  After limiting the sample to adults aged 18-84 (NHIS top codes age at 85) who 
provided valid information regarding their sleep duration (just over 2% were missing data on 
sleep duration), the analytic sample consisted of 398,382 U.S. adults. We imputed the missing

non-responses (household income had the highest amount of item non-response at 9.0%) using 
the mi impute command with chained equations in Stata v15.  We produced 20 datasets. The 
analyses were replicated across the 20 datasets using the mi estimate command.   
Measures 
 
To measure sleep duration, respondents in the NHIS were asked “On average, how many 
hours of sleep do you get in a 24-hour period?” with responses recorded to the nearest hour. We 
categorized sleep duration into six or fewer hours (1), seven to eight hours (2), and nine or more 
hours (3), consistent with consensus recommendations provided by the American Academy of 
Sleep Medicine (AASM) and Sleep Research Society (SRS).38 We considered the sensitivity of 
this specification by further examining sleep duration using a more detailed five category 
specification used in prior research31: five or fewer hours, six hours, seven hours, eight hours, 
and nine or more hours. We also examined sleep duration using a continuous specification of 
hours of sleep. The substantive results of these alternative specifications were consistent with 
results that utilized the consensus recommendation and are presented in Supplemental Tables S3-
S5 as well as Supplemental Figure S1.  
 
We examined the relationship between sleep and survey year and determined that sleep 
duration changed in a non-linear fashion over this 13-year period. Therefore, we coded year as a 
categorical variable with 2004 as the referent. 2004 was the year that the NHIS began 
consistently asking about sleep duration and this approach is consistent with prior sleep research 
that used NHIS data.12 To examine how sleep trends may differ by race/ethnicity, we categorized 
self-reported race/ethnicity as non-Hispanic white (referent), non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and

non-Hispanic other (hereafter other), and estimated models that included an interaction term 
between years and race/ethnicity. 
In our multivariable models, we included covariates that may confound the relationship 
between survey years and sleep duration. The means and proportions of these covariates are 
presented in Table S1. We included linear age39 and quadratic age to account for the non-linear 
relationship between age and sleep duration found in prior studies, current Census region of 
residence (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West), gender (male or female),40 marital status41 
(married (referent), divorced/separated, widowed, and never married), and number of children.42 
Socioeconomic status included educational attainment (high school degree (referent), less than 
high school, some college, and college or more), annual household income ($0-$34,999 
(referent), $35,000-$74,999, and $75,000), and employment status using a measure of the 
number of hours per week worked43 (0 hours worked (referent), 0-39 hours worked, 40 hours 
worked, and 40 or more hours worked). Health behaviors and health outcomes included 
smoking44 (never smokers (referent), former smokers, current someday smokers, and current 
everyday smokers); alcohol drinking behavior45 (abstainers, former drinkers, current drinkers), 
body mass index (BMI) calculated using self-reported indicators of weight and height46 (normal 
weight (reference, BMI: 18.5-29.9), underweight (0-18.49), and obese ( 30)), self-reported 
health (fair or poor versus good, very good, or excellent), and psychological distress measured 
using the validated Kessler-6 scale (Cronbach’s alpha=0.84).  
Statistical Approach 
 
We began by estimating age-adjusted sleep duration by year from 2004 until 2017.  Next, 
we estimated multinomial logistic regression models predicting sleep duration, with adequate

sleep duration38,47 (seven to eight hours) as the base category.  These models adjusted for 
demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, and health and health behaviors. We then 
estimated models that included interaction terms between year and race/ethnicity to determine if 
trends in sleep duration varied by race/ethnicity. Our analyses accounted for the complex 
sampling design of the NHIS, and we provide the weighted estimates.  Finally, we used the 
margins command in Stata to calculate marginal predicted probabilities of short sleep by 
race/ethnicity at each survey year after adjustment for all covariates to assist with model 
interpretation.  
Results 
Table 1 shows the age-adjusted distribution of sleep duration (adjusted to the age 
distribution of 2004).  The reported sleep duration distribution is remarkably consistent from 
2004 to 2006, with about 28.6% of respondents sleeping six or fewer hours, about 63.0% 
sleeping seven to eight hours, and about 8.5% sleeping nine or more hours. In 2007, the 
proportion of respondents who reported sleeping six or fewer hours of sleep declined slightly 
while the proportion who reported sleeping seven to eight hours increased to 65.0%. The decline 
in short sleep duration in this period is not surprising given this was during the recession, when 
many Americans lost their jobs and had more time to sleep.48,49 By 2010, the rates of short sleep 
largely stabilized to levels seen prior to 2007. In 2013, however, the proportion of respondents 
who reported sleeping, on average, six or fewer hours increased to 30.9% while the proportion 
who reported sleeping seven to eight hours declined to 60.8%.  By 2017, almost 33.0% of 
respondents reported sleeping six or fewer hours, about 59.8% reported sleeping seven to eight 
hours, and 7.3% reported sleeping nine or more hours. While the absolute increases in short sleep

duration are non-trivial (a 4% increase in short sleep duration among non-institutionalized U.S. 
adults corresponds to more than 9 million American adults or the population size of New York 
City), the relative differences are stark; a 15% increase between 2004 and 2017 that was 
concentrated largely from 2013 to 2017. 
[Table 1 here] 
Table 2 provides log-odds from multinomial logistic models that predict sleep duration 
with adequate sleep (seven to eight hours) as the base category. Importantly, these models are 
adjusted for demographic, behavioral health, health, familial and socioeconomic factors.  The 
full results, including controls, are presented in Table S2. The results between 2004 and 2012 are 
consistent with prior research.12,50 Even with added statistical controls, there was little change in 
sleep duration from 2004 to 2012. We did, however, find a statistically significant increased risk 
for short sleep duration from 2013 to 2017 relative to 2004. We also examined the linear trend in 
sleep duration over time (results not shown) and found a statistically significant annual increase 
in reports of short sleep (b: 0.02, 95% CI: 0.02-0.02), corresponding to a roughly 2% increase 
(e.02) per year in the relative risk ratio of short-sleep reports relative to normal-duration sleep. 
[Table 2 here] 
We next examined how sleep duration varied by race/ethnicity by interacting 
race/ethnicity and year. We present log-odds from the multinomial interaction models in Table 3 
and the corresponding predicted marginal probabilities in Figure 1. For white adults, the 
probability of sleeping six or fewer hours declined from 2006 to 2007, and then slowly increased 
through 2017 to almost 31.0%, an absolute increase of about 2 percentage points from 2004.

black adults had higher probabilities of short sleep duration than white adults across the entire 
period; from 2004 to 2009, their probability of short sleep was around 35%, but after 2010, their 
probability of short sleep began to increase, reaching a high of 41.8% in 2016 and then slightly 
subsiding in 2017. As a result, by 2017 there was a 10-percentage point black-white difference, 
compared to a 5.6-percentage point difference in 2004. Conversely, Hispanic adults had a lower 
probability of short sleep duration than white adults in 2004 (25.9% versus 28.7%, respectively), 
but they experienced a marked increase in short sleep from 2009 to 2016 so that by 2017 they 
were slightly more likely than white adults to report short sleep (32.9% versus 30.9%). We also 
examined the change in short sleep duration relative to 2004 for each race/ethnic group in order 
to illustrate the relative amount of change that occurred over time for each group and we show 
this in Supplemental Figure 2.

Discussion 
 
Our findings indicate there has been an increase in the prevalence of U.S. adults who report 
sleeping six or fewer hours in recent years. Fully one-third of U.S. adults reported short sleep in 
2017, representing a 15% increase since 2004. Consistent with prior research,12,13,50 we found no 
evidence of change in short sleep from 2004 to 2012, but by extending the analysis of sleep 
duration trends through 2017 we observed an increase in short sleep beginning in 2013. The

increase we observed corresponds with a period of economic instability, a rise in societal stress,26 
and greater use of  technology, such as smartphones, that have been shown to impact sleep.21  
 
Alarmingly, we found the largest increases in short sleep duration were concentrated 
among black and Hispanic adults. The probabilities of short sleep increased 6.5 percentage 
points between 2004 and 2017 for blacks and 7 percentage points for Hispanics, compared to an 
increase of only two percentage points among whites.  Race/ethnic differences in sleep duration 
were not explained by markers of social advantage, such as income and education, or differences 
in physical and mental health. Previous research has found higher odds of short sleep for black 
and Hispanic adults compared to white adults,30,31 and we show these inequalities are widening, 
which is consistent with other recent research on sleep duration trends.14 Growing race/ethnic 
inequalities in sleep duration are concerning as they could worsen already large and persistent 
race/ethnic health disparities.51,52  
There is relatively limited research on sleep duration trends in the U.S. population and 
few studies with which we can compare our results. We replicated findings from previous 
research on reported sleep duration in the NHIS that found no change in sleep duration between 
2004 and 2012.12,13 Our findings suggest the increasing risk of short sleep duration has emerged 
relatively recently and thus would not have been observed in these prior studies. This contrasts 
with a recent study using American Time Use Survey (ATUS) data that examined sleep duration 
trends from 2003 through 2016 and reported a total increase in daily sleep duration of about 19 
minutes on weekdays and 10 minutes on weekends.14 It is unclear, however, if the increase 
reflects additional time spent sleeping or  more time spent in bed.53 ATUS interviewers are 
instructed to code up to 30 minutes after respondents say they went to bed as time spent sleeping,

though some of this time was most likely spent trying to fall asleep.54 This may be one of the 
reasons our findings differ from those published using ATUS data. Our results may also differ if 
self-reported sleep duration captures quality as well as quantity of sleep. For instance, Americans 
may be sleeping the same amount, but if their sleep quality has declined in recent years, they 
may feel that they are getting less sleep. Nevertheless, prior research documenting the adverse 
health consequences of sleep at the population level has largely relied on studies using self-
reported sleep measures,55 including the NHIS,56,57 and evidence of increasing reports of short-
sleep in the population may have implications for population health trends.  
There are important limitations to this study. First, we relied on self-reports of habitual 
sleep duration, which tend to overestimate sleep time relative to more objective measures of 
sleep such as actigraphy and polysomnography58–60 and underestimate sleep time relative to 
measures of sleep duration obtained from time use studies.61 Although measurement bias in the 
NHIS sleep measure may have changed over time it is unlikely there was a sudden shift in the 
later years that would account for the increase in short sleep observed in recent years.  
Importantly, white adults tend to overestimate their sleep time to a greater extent than black 
adults,59 which may explain some of the race gap in sleep duration. However, race differences in 
reporting bias were unlikely to have shifted substantially after 2012 when the race gap in sleep 
duration began to widen. Furthermore, we also found an increasing gap between whites and 
Hispanics, a population that overestimates their sleep duration at similar levels to whites.59  
There are several sources of potential measurement error in the NHIS sleep duration 
measure. For instance, respondents tend to round sleep to the nearest hour when asked to report 
on the typical amount of sleep they get, which can result in a loss of precision, with prior

research finding a tendency to heap responses at six, seven, and eight hours of sleep.62 Sleep 
duration in the NHIS is rounded to the nearest hour, for all respondents, which may exacerbate 
this loss of precision. In addition, NHIS asks a single question about one’s average sleep 
duration in a 24-hour period, and does not distinguish between weekday and weekend sleep, 
which has been shown to vary substantially14,62 in time use studies. Finally, the context of the 
survey can introduce social desirability bias in respondent sleep reports. Prior research suggests 
respondents would be embarrassed to report inadequate sleep in a survey of health;62 thus, sleep 
duration may be overestimated in the NHIS.   
Though we included a number of controls for social, economic, household, and health 
characteristics in multivariable analysis, we could not account for other important factors 
associated with sleep such as the use of sleep medications, screen time, media consumption 
around bedtime, or everyday stressors that may have shifted over time. And although we note 
that the recent increase in short sleep coincides with a period of economic instability following 
the recent recession, as well as a rise in use of technology near bedtime, we did not investigate 
these factors directly. Nevertheless, our findings of an increasing trend in short sleep duration in 
the population in recent years suggest there have been important macro-level changes that should 
be investigated.   
Discrepant findings across major national studies utilizing different measures of sleep 
makes it difficult to determine the direction and magnitude of change in sleep duration across the 
U.S. population. With improvements to the accessibility and cost of sleep tracking technology, 
such as wearable devices, national surveys can conduct additional studies to investigate potential 
sources of error in their sleep measures. Calibration across measures derived from respondent

reports and actigraphy, for instance, could be used to determine if trends in sleep duration reflect 
actual change, change in perception, or merely measurement error. Furthermore, results could be 
calibrated more easily across studies if more objective sleep data, such as from actigraphy, were 
collected. However, data would need to be collected on a sufficiently large sample so within 
group differences can be examined. 
This study highlights the importance of continued surveillance of population-level sleep 
trends among vulnerable populations, particularly following major social, economic, and 
technological changes.  Much of the existing literature on sleep trends has not examined how 
sleep has changed across racial and ethnic groups.50,58 Our findings are the first to show 
increasing race/ethnic disparities in self-reported sleep duration. Because inadequate sleep is a 
proximate determinant of poor health,58 these trends may have important consequences for 
population health and race/ethnic health disparities.
