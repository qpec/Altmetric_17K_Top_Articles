Introduction
Overview
The aim of this paper is to discuss the function of brain serotonin 
(5-HT) transmission by focusing on two of its major receptor sub-
types, the 5-HT1AR and 5-HT2AR. Our selective focus on these 
receptors is justified by their dense and widespread expression in 
the human brain (Beliveau et al., 2016), diametrically opposite 
functional effects (Araneda and Andrade, 1991) and extensive 
evidence implicating both in psychiatric disorders and their treat-
ment (Chattopadhyay, 2007). We believe that a fuller understand-
ing of the function of 5-HT1A and particularly, 5-HT2A receptor 
signalling motivates a revision of current thinking on a well-
known problem in neuropsychopharmacology, namely: what 
principal function is served by brain serotonin transmission? 
Broadly consistent with prior theories (Deakin, 2013), we main-
tain that a key function of brain 5-HT is to moderate anxiety and 
stress, and promote patience and coping (Miyazaki et al., 2012) 
via (postsynaptic) 5-HT1AR signalling. Crucially however, we 
also extend on this by proposing that a second major function of 
brain 5-HT is to open a window of plasticity for greater adaptation 
(Branchi, 2011), mediated in large part by 5-HT2AR signalling. 
This bipartite model is consistent with a ‘flexible coping’ model 
of brain serotonin function, in which postsynaptic 5-HT1ARs 
mediate so-called ‘passive coping’ (i.e. tolerating but not neces-
sarily dealing with a source of psychological pain) and 5-HT2ARs 
mediate ‘active coping’ (actively dealing with a source of psycho-
logical pain by changing one’s relationship to it) (Puglisi-Allegra 
and Andolina, 2015). Note: we use the term ‘plasticity’ in a broad 
sense throughout this paper to refer to the capacity for change and 
we address our intentional neglect of the other serotonin receptors 
in the discussion section as well as immediately below.
The charge that our neglect of the functioning of the full range 
of serotonin receptors means that the present paper cannot be 
considered a fully comprehensive model of brain serotonin func-
tion is one we accept. However, we propose that the functioning 
of signalling at other serotonin receptors (than 1A and 2A) may, 
in several cases, be comfortably incorporated into either (or both) 
arms of the bipartite model we introduce below – and we encour-
age attempts to do this. A final introductory caveat is that signal-
ling at serotonin receptors can have more than one function, 
depending on such factors as: basal serotonin efflux and related 
synaptic concentrations, the specific localisation of the relevant 
receptor subtype (e.g. whether they are pre- or postsynaptic), the 
temporal development or time course of a specific pharmacologi-
cal manipulation, and the animal’s present behavioural state (e.g.

Abstract
Previous attempts to identify a unified theory of brain serotonin function have largely failed to achieve consensus. In this present synthesis, we 
integrate previous perspectives with new and older data to create a novel bipartite model centred on the view that serotonin neurotransmission 
enhances two distinct adaptive responses to adversity, mediated in large part by its two most prevalent and researched brain receptors: the 5-HT1A and 
5-HT2A receptors. We propose that passive coping (i.e. tolerating a source of stress) is mediated by postsynaptic 5-HT1AR signalling and characterised 
by stress moderation. Conversely, we argue that active coping (i.e. actively addressing a source of stress) is mediated by 5-HT2AR signalling and 
characterised by enhanced plasticity (defined as capacity for change). We propose that 5-HT1AR-mediated stress moderation may be the brain’s default 
response to adversity but that an improved ability to change one’s situation and/or relationship to it via 5-HT2AR-mediated plasticity may also be 
important – and increasingly so as the level of adversity reaches a critical point. We propose that the 5-HT1AR pathway is enhanced by conventional 
5-HT reuptake blocking antidepressants such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), whereas the 5-HT2AR pathway is enhanced by 
5-HT2AR-agonist psychedelics. This bipartite model purports to explain how different drugs (SSRIs and psychedelics) that modulate the serotonergic 
system in different ways, can achieve complementary adaptive and potentially therapeutic outcomes.

see Mitchell, 2005 for a relevant review). As much as is possible, 
we have endeavoured to acknowledge such inherent complexities 
in the serotonin system – particularly when we feel they are criti-
cal for a proper comprehension of the relevant phenomenon – but 
this has had to be balanced against considerations of parsimony 
and focus – in any already extensive narrative review.
With these caveats entered, let us return to the main focus of 
this paper: brain serotonin functioning – as seen through postsyn-
aptic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor signalling. The 5-HT1AR is 
highly expressed in brain regions involved in regulating stress 
and emotion and 5-HT has an especially high affinity for its 1A 
receptor (Peroutka and Snyder, 1979). We suggest that the 
5-HT1AR and its associated functions dominate 5-HT transmis-
sion under normal conditions but that 5-HT2AR signalling also 
serves a role that becomes increasingly important during extreme 
states when 5-HT release is elevated. We propose that 5-HT 
mediates stress moderation and plasticity-mediated adaptability 
in response to different levels of stress and adversity, via its post-
synaptic 1A and 2A receptors respectively. We acknowledge that 
agonism at other 5-HT receptors has also been linked with neuro-
trophic factors and other molecular markers of neuroplasticity 
(Kraus et al., 2017); however, our focus here is on the remarkable 
psychological and functional plasticity associated with the acute 
‘psychedelic’ state – as produced by psychedelic drugs such as 
LSD and psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016c) – and the 
enduring changes that appear to follow from exposure to these 
drugs’ effects (e.g. MacLean et al., 2011). We also propose that 
combined signalling at the 5-HT1A and 2A receptors has a gener-
ally complementary influence on mood, facilitating stress relief 
(5-HT1AR-mediated) but also a flexibility of mind (5-HT2AR-
mediated) that under favourable conditions (Alboni et al., 2017; 
Branchi, 2011; Chiarotti et al., 2017; Hartogsohn, 2016), is con-
ducive to positive mood (Hirt et al., 2008; Schmid et al., 2015). 
In what follows, we present evidence supporting these hypothe-
ses and discuss their clinical significance.
The function of brain serotonin is an enigma
There have been several attempts to identify a unifying function 
of dopaminergic transmission in the brain (Berridge and Robinson, 
1998; Schultz, 2010; Schwartenbeck et al., 2014) and similar 
attempts have been made for serotonin (Andrews et al., 2015; 
Azmitia, 2007; Branchi, 2011; Dayan and Huys, 2009; Deakin, 
1998). Most researchers acknowledge that the function of the 
5-HT system remains ‘elusive’ (Dayan and Huys, 2009) and ‘a 
puzzle’ (Cools et al., 2008; Dayan and Huys, 2015; Seymour 
et al., 2012) and it is argued here that this may be due to the spe-
cial diversity and complexity of the serotonin system with its 
many receptor subtypes (Hoyer et al., 1994), extensive innerva-
tion of the brain and paracrine style of transmission (Hornung, 
2003; Jennings, 2013). The notion that 5-HT is an enigma among 
neuromodulators (said to be ‘involved in everything but responsi-
ble for nothing’ (Muller and Homberg, 2015)) is relevant here, 
and it is argued that the riddle of 5-HT can only be solved by 
focusing on its individual receptor subtypes.
Accordingly, given the inherent complexity of the serotonin 
system, one strategy for understanding its functioning is to focus 
on a select number of receptor subtypes that have been particularly 
well characterised. From this foundation, one might then consider 
whether other serotonin receptor subtypes can be incorporated into 
the associated model, or whether one or more additional models 
are required to cover the full range of functions associated with 
brain serotonin transmission. Following this approach, we have 
chosen to concentrate on the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors. Our 
reasons for doing this are (at least) three-fold, and include: (1) the 
prevalence of their expression in the human brain and specific 
localisation – e.g. in stress circuitry (5-HT1AR) and high-level 
cortex (5-HT2AR) (e.g. Beliveau et al., 2016); (2) compelling evi-
dence for their involvement in the pharmacology of different psy-
chiatric disorders and medications (Celada et al., 2004); and (3) 
their apparent functional pre-eminence and opposition – as has 
been noted by others (Azmitia, 2001). Following on from this last 
point, the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors show diametrically 
opposite responses to their endogenous ligand, with 5-HT1A 
receptor signalling being inhibitory and 5-HT2A receptor signal-
ling being excitatory (Araneda and Andrade, 1991; Azmitia, 2001; 
Charig et al., 1986; Fletcher et al., 2007). This stark functional 
opposition is intriguing – and motivates us to ask why this should 
be the case, and what purpose it serves? We suggest that inherent 
diversity within the serotonergic system relates to its capacity for 
flexibly and adaptably responding to different degrees of adversity 
and challenge in the organism’s environment, with distinct 
responses mediated by distinct serotonergic pathways.
As noted above, an obvious caveat here is that 5-HT receptors 
we do not specifically focus on in the present review may com-
plement one or the other of these two pathways – and may also 
modulate unrelated physiological and behavioural functions. For 
example, signalling at 5-HT receptors other than the 2A receptor 
has been associated with neuroplasticity (Kraus et al., 2017) – 
and thus, may also feed into pathway 2 (below). Similarly block-
ade of certain 5-HT receptors (e.g. 5-HT2C, 5-HT7 and even 
5-HT2A) may complement pathway 1 (below). However, a thor-
ough coverage of this matter is beyond the scope of this article.
In what follows, focus is directed to 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A 
receptor signalling and research pertaining to their associated 
functions. It is argued that studying potent serotonergic com-
pounds such as rapid-acting, highly effective 5-HT releasers (such 
as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetanine, MDMA (Baumann 
et al., 2008; Heifets and Malenka, 2016)) and direct 5-HT2AR 
agonist psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin and lysergic acid 
diethylamide, LSD (Glennon et al., 1984; Vollenweider et al., 
1998), can be particularly informative about the function of sero-
tonergic transmission in the brain because their acute and longer-
term effects are especially marked and novel (Griffiths et al., 
2008; Mithoefer et al., 2013), and there is a growing literature on 
human research with such drugs, including an increasing number 
of neuroimaging studies (Carhart-Harris et al., 2013b, 2015b; 
Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013) and clinical trials (Bogenschutz 
et al., 2015; Carhart-Harris et al., 2016a; Gasser et al., 2014; 
Griffiths et al., 2016; Grob et al., 2011; Mithoefer et al., 2011; 
Ross et al., 2016; Sanches et al., 2016) – see Carhart-Harris and 
Goodwin (2017) for a review.
Note: we acknowledge that MDMA also releases dopamine 
(DA) and noradrenaline (NA) (Baumann et al., 2008) but its 5-HT 
releasing properties are many times greater than its catecholamine 
releasing properties, e.g. 5-HT release in the frontal cortex is approx-
imately 5 times that of DA release (Golembiowska et al., 2016), 
preferential 5-HT versus DA and NA release is unusual for an 
amphetamine, and MDMA’s subjective effects are also distinct from 
those of other more conventional amphetamines (Bedi et al., 2014).

Serotonin receptor subtypes
What is the 5-HT2AR and where is it 
expressed?
The 5-HT2AR is one of at least 14 different 5-HT receptor sub-
types expressed in the mammalian brain (Glennon, 2000), and 
like almost all of these, it is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). 
In the context of neurotransmission, the principal effect of 5-HT 
binding to the 5-HT2AR is to increase the excitability of the host 
neuron, and the 5-HT2AR is the main excitatory GPCR of the 
serotonin receptor family (Andrade, 2011).
The 5-HT2AR is predominantly a cortical receptor; indeed, it 
is the most abundant 5-HT receptor in the cortex (Varnas et al., 
2004). In humans, the density of 5-HT2AR expression is rela-
tively high throughout the cortex and especially so in high-level 
associative cortex – such as regions belonging to the so-called 
default-mode network (see Figure 1) (Beliveau et al., 2016). 
5-HT2AR expression is considerably higher in the cortex than in 
subcortical structures such as the thalamus, basal ganglia, and 
hippocampus (Gross-Isseroff et al., 1990; Hall et al., 2000) – 
with minimal/negligible expression in the cerebellum and brain-
stem (Hall et al., 2000). The predominantly cortical expression of 
the 5-HT2AR places it at a high evolutionary and hierarchical 
level and as we will discuss later (e.g. Section 4.4), this is likely 
to have important functional implications.
In terms of its cellular and laminar localisation, 5-HT2A recep-
tors are most densely expressed on the dendrites of excitatory glu-
tamatergic pyramidal neurons, particular in layer V of the cortex 
(Weber and Andrade, 2010). One study found that almost all glu-
tamatergic neurons in layers II-V of the monkey and human pre-
frontal cortex (PFC) expressed 5-HT2ARs, whereas only about 
30% of GABAergic interneurons within the same layers exhibited 
5-HT2AR expression (de Almeida and Mengod, 2007). Thus, 
cortical pyramidal neurons are likely to be especially sensitive to 
modulation via 5-HT activating 5-HT2ARs, and furthermore, the 
laminar localisation of 5-HT2ARs (e.g. in layer V of the cortex) 
corresponds well with the localisation of axon terminals of sero-
tonergic neurons, particularly in the cortex (Blue et al., 1988). 
These data imply that cortical 5-HT2ARs should be sensitive to 
changes in synaptic serotonin concentrations (Tyacke and Nutt, 
2015). A well-demonstrated effect of (prefrontal) cortical 
5-HT2AR signalling is the initiation of a negative feedback mech-
anism which inhibits the firing of serotonergic neurons in the dor-
sal raphe nucleus (Boothman et al., 2003; Quesseveur et al., 
2013), suggesting that the 5-HT2AR plays a crucial role in regu-
lating the release of serotonin in the cortex, via a top-down modu-
latory influence on a cortical-raphe inhibitory feedback circuit 
(Sharp et al., 2007; Vazquez-Borsetti et al., 2009).
What is the 5-HT1AR and where is it 
expressed?
Identified in the early 1980s as a distinct 5-HT receptor subtype 
(Pedigo et al., 1981), the 5-HT1AR is densely expressed in mid-
brain, limbic and cortical regions (Varnas et al., 2004). 5-HT1AR 
agonism causes host-cell hyperpolarisation and an inhibition of 
firing via G protein-mediated mechanisms (Oleskevich et al., 
2005). The 5-HT1AR is highly expressed on serotonergic neurons 
in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei where it functions as a pre-
synaptic autoreceptor – exerting a strong homeostatic control over 
5-HT neuron firing rates and thus, 5-HT efflux in the forebrain 
(Lanfumey and Hamon, 2000). The majority of 5-HT1A receptors 
are expressed postsynaptically in many brain regions, particularly 
the limbic system (especially the hippocampus) and cortex (Pazos 
et al., 1987; Varnas et al., 2004) see Figure 1. Presynaptic 
5-HT1ARs readily desensitise following exposure to increased

signalling and concerned with passive endurance, and ‘pathway 2’ refers to the ‘active coping’ pathway hypothesised to be mediated by 5-HT2AR 
signalling and concerned with an active change in outlook and/or behaviour. Images reproduced from (Beliveau et al., 2016) with permission. Note: 
The dense expression of the 5-HT1AR in medial temporal lobe regions and particularly the hippocampus is not clearly evident in the relevant maps 
shown here (left) but can be seen in values presented in the paper itself, as well as others (Pazos and Palacios, 1985; Pazos et al., 1987).

5-HT availability (e.g. through chronic selective serotonin reup-
take inhibitors (SSRIs)) but postsynaptic 5-HT1ARs do not 
(Lanfumey and Hamon, 2000), although they do appear to down-
regulate in response to stress (Berton et al., 1998; Lopez et al., 
1999) – and perhaps relatedly, to electroconvulsive shock (Burnet 
et al., 1955, 1999). In summary, based on its high density of 
expression, localisation to regions densely innervated by seroton-
ergic projections (such as the hippocampus) and high affinity for 
its endogenous ligand, the postsynaptic 5-HT1AR is serotonin’s 
principal inhibitory receptor in the brain.
Serotonin 2A versus 1A receptor signalling
At a basic level, the principal effect of 5-HT2AR activation is to 
increase the excitability of the host neuron (Andrade, 2011). If the 
host neuron is excitatory (e.g. a pyramidal neuron), the outcome 
of 5-HT2AR stimulation may be to increase its firing and the fir-
ing of those cells that it projects to. If the host cell is inhibitory 
(e.g. a GABAergic interneuron), the net result of 5-HT2AR stimu-
lation will be to increase its firing and so enhance its inhibitory 
influence onto the neurons to which it projects (Andrade, 2011). 
Given that 5-HT2ARs are expressed mostly on excitatory neurons 
(at least in the cortex – where their expression is highest) one 
might expect release of endogenous 5-HT in the cortex to elicit a 
mostly excitatory effect but this is not what is typically observed 
(Hajos et al., 2003; Jacobs and Azmitia, 1992; Puig et al., 2005). 
For example, in vivo studies investigating the effect of dorsal 
raphe nucleus stimulation (inducing an increase in cortical 5-HT 
efflux) on cellular activity in the medial PFC (mPFC) have 
observed a decrease in the firing rate of the majority of pyramidal 
cells recorded (Hajos et al., 2003; Puig et al., 2005). Importantly, 
this effect appears to be modulated via postsynaptic 5-HT1ARs, 
since it could be prevented by a selective 5-HT1AR antagonist 
(Hajos et al., 2003; Puig et al., 2005). Consistently, chronic dorsal 
raphe stimulation was found to decrease metabolism in limbic 
regions, alongside decreases in depressive behaviours, presuma-
bly via inhibitory postsynaptic 5-HT1ARs (Urban et al., 2016).
It is a well-replicated finding that postsynaptic 5-HT1AR and 
5-HT2AR activation produces opposite effects on single cell activ-
ity, with 5-HT1AR signalling having a hyperpolarising (inhibitory) 
effect, and 5-HT2AR activation causing a depolarising (excitatory) 
effect (Andrade, 2011; Araneda and Andrade, 1991). Up to 80% of 
pyramidal neurons in the PFC co-express 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A 
receptors (Amargos-Bosch et al., 2004). Studies in the 1970s and 
80s suggested that 5-HT has an appreciably higher affinity for its 
1A than 2A receptor (Hoyer et al., 1985; Peroutka and Snyder, 
1979) but further research with 5-HT2AR agonist ligands suggest 
that, like other neuromodulator receptors (Skinbjerg et al., 2012) 
the 5-HT2A receptor can exist in a low (G-protein uncoupled) or 
high affinity (G-protein coupled) state – and when in their high-
affinity state, 5-HT has a higher affinity for its 5-HT2AR than pre-
viously appreciated (Sleight et al., 1996). Under normal conditions, 
5-HT1AR signalling seems to dominate serotoninergic functioning 
in cortical as well as limbic regions (Puig et al., 2005). However, as 
we will discuss later (e.g. Section 4), the 5-HT2A receptor is still 
likely to be functionally relevant, and we predict, increasingly so 
during states of exceptionally high adversity (Amargos-Bosch 
et al., 2004; Puig et al., 2005). In this context, the possibility that 
high-affinity 5-HT2ARs upregulate (Benekareddy et al., 2010; 
Berton et al., 1998) and 5-HT1ARs downregulate during extreme 
adversity (Berton et al., 1998; Lopez et al., 1999) is an intriguing 
one, which seems deserving of further study.
The opposite effect of electroconvulsive shock on 5-HT1A 
and 5-HT2A receptor functioning in rats may be relevant here, 
with (hippocampal but not the dentate gyrus) 5-HT1AR expres-
sion appearing to decrease post ECS while 5-HT2AR functioning 
increases (Burnet et al., 1995, 1999). Conversely however, ECS/
electroconvulsive therapy appears to downregulate 5-HT2AR 
binding in primates (Strome et al., 2005) and humans (Yatham 
 
et al., 2010) – an effect that is more consistent with that of con-
ventional antidepressant medications (Yatham et al., 1999) as 
well as direct 5-HT2AR agonism (Buckholtz et al., 1990) – while 
also being the logical consequence of acutely enhanced 5-HT 
release with ECS/ECT (Zis et al., 1992).
Psychological functions associated 
with brain 5-HT
Impulsivity and aggression
One of the most reliable behavioural effects of reducing 5-HT trans-
mission in the brain is to increase impulsive and aggressive behav-
iours (Audero et al., 2013; Brown et al., 1979; Duke et al., 2013; 
Mosienko et al., 2015; Soubrie, 1986). Indeed, some of the earliest 
hypotheses on the function of 5-HT in the brain proposed that it 
serves to suppress behavioural response to pain (Harvey et al., 
1975), anxiety (Wise et al., 1970) and aversive stimuli more gener-
ally (Deakin and Graeff, 1991; Soubrie, 1986) and these ideas con-
tinue to have traction (Deakin, 2013; Yanowitch and Coccaro, 
2011). The anti-aggression effects of 5-HT enhancing compounds 
led to them being called ‘serenics’ (Olivier and Moss, 1990), a fit-
ting term in our view, and one that is also apt in relation to the sub-
jective effects of MDMA, a particularly potent 5-HT releaser. 
Related to these hypotheses, is the notion that 5-HT transmission 
enables a person to better tolerate delay (Soubrie, 1986), and the 
patience-promoting properties of 5-HT have recently received sig-
nificant experimental support (Fonseca et al., 2015; McDannald, 
2015; Miyazaki et al., 2012, 2014; Ranade et al., 2014). Low con-
centrations of the serotonin metabolite (5-HIAA), implying low 
central 5-HT function, have been associated with impulsivity 
(Fairbanks et al., 2001), aggression (Brown and Linnoila, 1990) 
and suicidal behaviour (Asberg et al., 1976), and tryptophan deple-
tion (a diet-based approach that produces a transient depletion of 
central 5-HT) has also been found to enhance impulsivity and 
aggression (Dougherty et al., 1999, 2010). In contrast, tryptophan 
supplementation (Duke et al., 2013), acute MDMA administration 
(Ramaekers and Kuypers, 2006; van Wel et al., 2012), acute fenflu-
ramine (Cherek and Lane, 2001) and chronic 5-HT reuptake inhibi-
tor administration (Butler et al., 2010; Wolff and Leander, 2002), all 
of which are known to increase central 5-HT function, have all been 
found to reduce impulsivity and aggression. For a more in-depth 
discussion of the complexities of the relationship between brain 
5-HT and aggression, including some contradictory findings to the 
rule that low synaptic 5-HT is associated with increased aggression, 
see this review (Mitchell, 2005).
5-HT1AR signalling, impulsivity and aggression. There are 
solid grounds to believe that the anti-aggression and impulsivity 
effects of 5-HT are mediated by postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor 
signalling (Sanchez and Hyttel, 1994; Schreiber and De Vry, 
 Carhart-Harris and Nutt 
1095
1993), with some contribution from postsynaptic 5-HT1B recep-
tors (Ramboz et al., 1996; Sijbesma et al., 1991). Assessing the 
functional effects of 5-HT1A receptor manipulations is compli-
cated, however, owing to the opposing influences of pre- and 
postsynaptic 1A receptor activation. Prior to a time-dependent 
5-HT1A autoreceptor desensitisation by reuptake blockers (Le 
Poul et al., 1995), stimulation of these presynaptic 5-HT1A 
receptors reduces serotonin efflux, whereas postsynaptic 5-HT1A 
receptor activation is an important (and often clinically desirable) 
consequence of increased serotonin efflux (Artigas, 2013b). 
Moreover, selective 5-HT1AR antagonists or full 5-HT1AR ago-
nists are not available for human use (beyond the very low doses 
used in PET imaging), and so cannot be used to incisively inform 
on this matter. With these caveats, it can be relatively safely 
inferred that (postsynaptic) 5-HT1AR agonism appears to reduce 
aggressive and impulsive behaviours (de Boer and Koolhaas, 
2005; Olivier et al., 1989; Popova et al., 2007; Sanchez and Hyt-
tel, 1994; White et al., 1991; Wolff and Leander, 2002). Note, 
however, that many 5-HT1A receptor agonists are in fact, only 
partial agonists; thus, their impact on net 5-HT1AR signalling is 
dependent on basal 5-HT efflux and competition with the full 
agonist endogenous ligand, 5-HT itself (Mitchell, 2005).
It has been claimed that the 5-HT1AR is the most prevalent 
and well-distributed 5-HT receptor in the brain (Paterson et al., 
2013; Varnas et al., 2004). Serotonin has a high affinity for this 
receptor subtype (Peroutka and Snyder, 1979), serotonergic pro-
jections densely innervate 5-HT1AR-rich regions (Hornung, 
2003) and 5-HT concentrations may be higher in 5-HT1AR-rich 
subcortical/limbic regions than in the 5-HT2AR-rich cortex dur-
ing basal conditions (Bose et al., 2011; Erritzoe et al., 2010; 
Kirby et al., 1995; Rueter and Jacobs, 1996), although see Adell 
et al. (1991) and Hjorth and Sharp (1991). These factors imply 
that manipulation of synaptic 5-HT concentrations will signifi-
cantly impact on postsynaptic 5-HT1AR signalling and limbic 
functioning. With this in mind, it is telling that 5-HT lesions and 
depletion both tend to promote impulsivity and aggression 
(Audero et al., 2013; Dougherty et al., 1999), whereas stimulat-
ing serotonin function tends to reduce these behaviours 
(Miyazaki et al., 2014). It is also relevant that the potent 5-HT 
releaser, MDMA, has marked pro-social, pro-empathy, anti-
aggressive effects during the acute phase (Bedi et al., 2010, 
2014; Frye et al., 2014; Hysek et al., 2012, 2014a; Kamboj et al., 
2015; Kirilly et al., 2006; Schmid et al., 2014; Stewart et al., 
2014), perhaps via an inhibitory action on activity in limbic 
regions (Carhart-Harris et al., 2015b), and some of these effects 
in rodents’ can be attenuated by pre-treatment with a 5-HT1A 
receptor antagonist (Hunt et al., 2011).
Table 1 summarises findings that support various associations 
between 5-HT, signalling at its post-synaptic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A 
receptors and relevant psychological phenomena. A number of 
these associations require qualification, e.g. 5-HT2AR agonism 
can have opposite acute and longer-term effects (Carhart-Harris 
et al., 2016c). To account for this, we use the acronyms ‘ST’ and 
‘LT’ for acute (short-term) and long-term outcomes respectively, 
where we feel disambiguation is required. Also, receptor signalling 
may increase plasticity in one region but decrease it in the other 
(e.g. Vaidya et al., 1997). As this matter is most relevant in relation 
to molecular markers of plasticity in the hippocampus and cortex, 
we use the acronyms ‘hip’ and ‘cx’ to provide the necessary disam-
biguation. Regarding plasticity, we use ‘general plasticity’ (gP) to 
refer simply to an increased capability for change and ‘regional 
plasticity’ (rP) when we are specifically referring regional changes 
in molecular markers of plasticity such as trophic factors. It is 
important to stress that the effects of 5-HT2AR agonism are highly 
context sensitive (see Figure 2), e.g. the effects of 5-HT2AR sig-
nalling on mood and mental health are likely highly sensitive to the 
quality of the environment in which a 5-HT2AR-mediated experi-
ence occurs (Johnson et al., 2008), and this rule may also apply for 
treatment with an SSRI (Branchi, 2011) perhaps due to increased 
5-HT2A receptor signalling through increased synaptic 5-HT. For 
this reason, and due to the still developing evidence base for psych-
edelics for depression (e.g. see Carhart-Harris and Goodwin, 
2017), we took the modest step of not describing the association 
between 5-HT2AR signalling and depression as ‘strong’ (+++). In 
fact, we describe all associations between 5-HT, mood and depres-
sion as resting on ‘reasonable’ (i.e. ++) evidence because we 
acknowledge that these associations are especially complex. Also, 
some aspects of cognition but not others may be enhanced by 
increased signalling at a specific receptor and this is not qualified 
in the table. The reader may therefore notice some contradictory 
associations, simply because the data are not straightforward in 
supporting one particular direction. Importantly, this table is not 
intended as an exhaustive nor comprehensive account of literature 
pertaining to brain serotonin function but rather as an overview of 
Table 1. Functions associated with brain serotonin.

considered a substitute for a detailed reading of the surrounding 
text. To properly understand the relevant associations, a careful 
reading of the text and supporting references is encouraged. Key: 
to provide a qualitative index of the perceived strength of evidence 
for a given association, we use the symbols +, ++ and +++ to 
denote ‘weak’, ‘reasonable’ and ‘strong’ evidence. Moreover, 
strong associations are shown in bold font. The ‘↑’ symbol denotes 
an increase in a particular factor and ‘↓’ denotes a decrease. The 
‘→’ symbol denotes that one factor causes another.
5-HT2AR signalling, impulsivity and aggression. In contrast 
to what is typically associated with postsynaptic 5-HT1AR ago-
nism, there is some evidence in rodents that 5-HT2AR agonism 
increases impulsivity (Anastasio et al., 2015; Carli et al., 2006; 
Winstanley et al., 2004). However, the relationship between the 
5-HT2AR and impulsivity and aggression in humans is some-
what ambiguous (da Cunha-Bang et al., 2013; van Wel et al., 
2012) and anti-impulsivity effects of 5-HT2AR antagonists may 
be an epiphenomenon of these compounds’ mild sleep-promot-
ing/sedating properties (Ivgy-May et al., 2015; Morairty et al., 
2008). Moreover, 5-HT2AR agonist psychedelics such as LSD 
and psilocybin are not typically associated with aggressive or 
impulsive behaviours in humans, and may even possess some 
pro-social properties in certain contexts (Dolder et al., 2016; 
Kraehenmann et al., 2016; Preller et al., 2016) – see also (Watts 
et al., 2017). Rare cases of behavioural disinhibition and even 
aggression have been observed with high doses of potent psyche-
delic 5-HT2AR agonists – but such incidences are likely to be 
strongly context specific (Gee et al., 2016). See Figure 2.
Anxiety and stress
5-HT1AR signalling, anxiety and stress. Related to the hypoth-
esis that 5-HT functions to moderate aversive mental states (Dea-
kin and Graeff, 1991) and promote patience (McDannald, 2015) is 
the notion that 5-HT plays an important role in negatively modulat-
ing anxiety (Piszczek et al., 2015). Selective reductions of 5-HT in 
the forebrain have been found to enhance anxiety-related behav-
iours (Pum et al., 2009; Tu et al., 2014), whereas chronically 
administered SSRIs have been found to reduce anxiety (Blanco 
et al., 2013). Like impulsivity and aggression, anxiety appears to 
be negatively modulated by 5-HT1AR stimulation (Heisler et al., 
1998; Parks et al., 1998; Schreiber and De Vry, 1993; Toth, 2003), 
and although there are some contradictory findings (File et al., 
1996), this effect appears to be mediated by postsynaptic 5-HT1AR 
signalling (Celada et al., 2013a; Gross et al., 2002; Piszczek et al., 
2015; Stefanski et al., 1993; Tauscher et al., 2001; Tu et al., 2014; 
Zhou et al., 2008, 2014).
Postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors are densely expressed in lim-
bic regions and particularly the hippocampus (Pazos and Palacios, 
1985; Varnas et al., 2004), which is known to be involved in anxi-
ety (Gray, 1983; Tu et al., 2014). Serotonin 1A receptors are 
highly expressed on excitatory neurons in the hippocampus 
(Pompeiano et al., 1992) and 5-HT1AR stimulation has an inhib-
itory influence on pyramidal neuron activity (Andrade, 2011). 
Hippocampal hyperactivity is strongly associated with states of 
anxiety and stress (Engel et al., 2009) and 5-HT appears to quell 
limbic hyperactivity via the inhibitory action of postsynaptic 
5-HT1ARs (Dong et al., 1998; Tada et al., 2004). This mecha-
nism could explain the reduced metabolism and blood flow 
observed in limbic regions with acutely administered MDMA 
(Carhart-Harris et al., 2015b; Gamma et al., 2000), buspirone 
(Friston et al., 1991), fenfluramine (thalamus and temporal cor-
tex (Meyer et al., 1996)) and chronically administered SSRIs 
(Mayberg et al., 2000) – as well as reduced cortico-limbic reac-
tivity to negative stimuli with MDMA (Bedi et al., 2009; Carhart-
Harris et al., 2014d) and SSRIs (Arnone et al., 2012; Ma, 2015). 
The improved ability to tolerate negative stimuli with both acute 
MDMA (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014d; Mithoefer et al., 2011, 
2013) and chronic SSRI treatment (Corchs et al., 2009; Mineur 
et al., 2015) may be due to elevated levels of synaptic 5-HT acti-
vating inhibitory postsynaptic 1A receptors in stress-sensitive 
limbic regions. It is also likely to explain the use of SSRIs and 
direct 5-HT1AR agonists such as buspirone, as anxiolytic medi-
cations. There is also compelling evidence through 5-HT1AR 
knock out studies that this receptor is involved in the moderation 
of anxiety (Chattopadhyay, 2007).
Punishment, 5-HT release and 5-HT1AR signalling. Intrigu-
ingly, other than pharmacological manipulations (Bradbury et al., 
2013), punishment is one of the most effective means of stimulat-
ing 5-HT release (Adell et al., 1997; Amat et al., 1998; Bland et al., 
2003a, 2003b; Ferres-Coy et al., 2013; Gronli et al., 2007; Kawa-
hara et al., 1993; Rex et al., 2005; Yoshioka et al., 1995). Several 
studies have demonstrated that anxiety (Rex et al., 2005) and stress 
(Fujino et al., 2002) can profoundly increase synaptic 5-HT. Con-
sistent with previous theories (Deakin, 2013), it seems reasonable 
to suppose that brain 5-HT functions to alleviate psychological dis-
tress under adverse conditions – thereby improving coping and 
resilience. The moderation of aversive mental states may be evolu-
tionarily advantageous in certain contexts, e.g. promoting a more 
patient, waiting and observing behavioural style, and perhaps 
greater sociability (or at least reduced anti-sociability). We suggest 
that this function is mediated by postsynaptic 5-HT1AR signalling, 
serving to quell hyperactivity in stress-sensitive circuits (Puig and 
Figure 2. Extra-pharmacological (EP) model of drug action. This 
model is intended to provide a comprehensive account of the action 
of psychoactive drugs that takes into account important extra-
pharmacological components such as trait, pre-state, dosage and 
environmental factors and how these interact with a given drug’s 
specific pharmacology to predict the quality of the acute ‘intoxicated’ 
or ‘medicated’ state and subsequent longer-term outcomes. The model 
is conceived with acute dosing in mind; however, it could also be 
adapted and applied to chronic dosing regimens.
 Carhart-Harris and Nutt 
1097
Gulledge, 2011), particularly under conditions of mild-moderate 
adversity. We link this to the notion of ‘passive coping’, since the 
behavioural outcome is one of improved endurance of adversity 
via a moderation of stress and perhaps emotional responsiveness 
more generally (McCabe et al., 2010; Price et al., 2009).
Anxiety, stress and the 5-HT2AR. The serotonin 2A receptor has 
also been implicated in anxiety. Serotonin 2A receptor knock-out 
mice display reduced anxiety which is normalised when its func-
tioning is recovered (Weisstaub et al., 2006). These findings sug-
gest that 5-HT2AR signalling has an anxiogenic effect that is 
opposite to the anxiolytic effect of postsynaptic 5-HT1AR activa-
tion. This idea is leant support by findings of reduced anxiety with 
5-HT2AR antagonism (Bressa et al., 1987). Serotonin 2A receptor 
agonists have complex effects on anxiety in humans (Zanoveli 
et al., 2005). Subjective anxiety is inconsistently and only margin-
ally increased by the 5-HT2AR agonists psilocybin and LSD dur-
ing their acute intoxication state (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a, 
2015a; Griffiths et al., 2006) (although acute panic can occur (Bar-
rett et al., 2016; Carbonaro et al., 2016)), yet there is increasing 
evidence that anxiety can be significantly reduced for a prolonged 
period after a therapeutically mediated psychedelic drug experi-
ence (Gasser et al., 2014, 2015; Griffiths et al., 2016; Grob et al., 
2011) – for a discussion of this apparent paradox see (Carhart-
Harris et al., 2016c). Thus, whereas postsynaptic 5-HT1AR activa-
tion appears to moderate anxiety and stress, the effect of 5-HT2AR 
activation is more complex (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016c). Simi-
larly, 5-HT2C receptor agonism has been associated with anxiety 
(and inversely with ‘assertiveness’ in rats) – but a more detailed 
discussion of 5-HT2C receptor functioning is beyond the remit of 
this paper (see Mitchell, 2005 for a relevant review).
The effects of 5-HT2AR signalling are highly context sensi-
tive. In forthcoming sections, we develop the idea that 5-HT2AR 
signalling has a time and context sensitive effect on cognition and 
emotion, increasing plasticity-related processes (and often anxiety 
(Griffiths et al., 2006)) in the short-term while facilitating open-
ness, learning and well-being in the longer-term (Carhart-Harris 
et al., 2016c; MacLean et al., 2011). If mediated properly (e.g. 
with appropriate psychological support and positive environmen-
tal conditions) the acute labile state can be used to facilitate emo-
tional approach and eventual acceptance with potentially enduring 
beneficial effects (Roseman et al., 2017b; Watts et al., 2017); 
moreover, it remains possible that reduced anxiety and improved 
general well-being during the post-acute ‘after glow’ (Winkelman 
et al., 2014) of a psychedelic experience is related to agonist-
induced 5-HT2AR downregulation (Buckholtz et al., 1990).
Consistent with a recent hypothesis on the function of brain 
5-HT (Branchi, 2011), we predict that the plasticity-enhancing 
effects of 5-HT accentuate the influence of environmental factors 
on the individual (Branchi, 2011) but we would qualify this rela-
tionship by emphasising that it is primarily a 5-HT2AR-mediated 
process. Thus, we propose that 5-HT2AR signalling opens a win-
dow of plasticity during which environmental-sensitivity is 
enhanced and significant therapeutic work can be done. Supporting 
this hypothesis, central 5-HT2ARs expression is highest during 
key developmental periods (Sheline et al., 2002; Volgin et al., 
2003) when plasticity-related learning is maximal. The quality of a 
5-HT2AR dependent psychedelic experience is known to be highly 
sensitive to the context in which it occurs (Hartogsohn, 2016) and 
to be consequently predictive of long-term mental health outcomes 
(Carhart-Harris et al., 2017; Roseman et al., 2017a).
Extra-pharmacological model of drug effects. The extra-phar-
macological or ‘EP’ model presented in Figure 2 is inspired by 
recent empirical and theoretical work on the psychedelic state and 
is conceived as a working model for testing and refining our 
understanding of the many determinants of the acute and longer-
term effects of psychoactive drugs in general, albeit with special 
reference and relevance to psychedelics. Trait factors may be bio-
logical (e.g. receptor polymorphisms (Ott et al., 2006)) or psycho-
logical in nature (e.g. personality (MacLean et al., 2011) or 
suggestibility (Carhart-Harris et al., 2015a)). The pre-state refers 
to such thing as anticipatory anxiety, expectations and assump-
tions (which account for so-called ‘placebo’ and ‘nocebo’ effects), 
and readiness to surrender resistances and ‘let go’ to the drug 
effects (e.g. see Russ and Elliott, 2017). In the context of psyche-
delic research, the pre-state is traditionally referred to as the ‘set’ 
(Hartogsohn, 2016). State refers to the acute subjective and bio-
logical quality of the drug experience and may be measured via 
subjective rating scales or brain imaging (see Roseman et al., 
2017). Dose relates to the drug dosage – which may be a critical 
determinant of state (Griffiths et al., 2011; Nour et al., 2016) – as 
well as long-term outcomes (Roseman et al., 2017). Environment 
relates to the various environmental influences. In the context of 
psychedelic research this is traditionally referred to as ‘setting’ 
(Hartogsohn, 2016). We recognise that the environment can be 
influential at all stages of the process of change associated with 
drug action. The long-term outcomes may include such things as 
symptoms of a specific psychiatric condition such as depression 
– measured using a standard rating scale (Carhart-Harris et al., 
2016a) as well as relatively pathology-independent factors such as 
personality (MacLean et al., 2011) and outlook (Nour et al., 
2017). The EP model may prove useful in future studies of psy-
chedelics that aim to determine the weighting or relative influence 
of different predictor variables on the quality of the acute state and 
longer-term outcomes. Predictor variables such as trait, pre-state, 
dose and environment could be entered as independent variables 
in a regression model, with state as the dependent variable. Simi-
larly, a regression model could include state as an independent 
‘predictor’ variable, with a long-term outcome as the dependent 
variable (for example as in Roseman et al., 2017a; Russ and 
Elliot, 2017). This model could eventually be used to assist 
screening for psychedelic therapy and inform on how the therapy 
is to be delivered, e.g. what dose to administer and how to tune the 
environment to promote optimal outcomes.
Learning and cognition
5-HT1AR signalling learning and cognition. Postsynaptic 
5-HT1AR stimulation is generally considered to be a desirable 
property of anxiolytic and antidepressant medications (Artigas, 
2015), and the postsynaptic 5-HT1AR is thought to be the princi-
pal (therapeutic) site of action of SSRIs (Artigas, 2013a, 2015; 
Samuels et al., 2015). Chronic treatment with SSRIs has been 
associated with increased neurogenesis (Boldrini et al., 2009), 
particularly in the hippocampus (Boldrini et al., 2009, 2012) and 
some improvements in learning and cognition (Bui et al., 2013), 
albeit with some contradictory findings (Deakin et al., 2004). 
There is evidence to suggest that increased neurogenesis (at least 
 1098 
Journal of Psychopharmacology 31(9)
in the hippocampus) is a 5-HT1AR-mediated effect (Gould, 1999; 
Huang and Herbert, 2005; Malberg et al., 2000; Santarelli et al., 
2003); however, other 5-HT receptors (e.g. the 5-HT4 and 
5-HT2A) are also thought to contribute (Azmitia, 2001; Imoto 
et al., 2015; Jha et al., 2008; Kraus et al., 2017).
Despite this association between 5-HT1AR signalling and 
neurogenesis, there is a body of evidence to suggest that postsyn-
aptic 5-HT1AR stimulation is impairing to learning and cognition 
(Ogren et al., 2008), so how can we reconcile these things? One 
possibility is that the observed pro-cognitive effects of SSRIs are 
actually mediated by other (non-1A) 5-HT receptors (Boulougouris 
et al., 2008; Furr et al., 2012; Imoto et al., 2015), and another is 
that improvements in cognition in patients treated with SSRIs is 
an epiphenomenon of improvements in mood (Chepenik et al., 
2007). It is also important to note that the evidence that SSRIs 
improve cognition is relatively weak (Beheydt et al., 2015; Knorr, 
2012; Knorr et al., 2011; Siepmann et al., 2003) and their modest 
ability to address cognitive symptoms in depression is considered 
one of their limitations (Popovic et al., 2015).
5-HT2AR signalling, learning and cognition. The relationship 
between the 5-HT2AR and cognition is somewhat different to that 
of the 5-HT1AR. As discussed above, activation of postsynaptic 
5-HT1ARs is associated with cognitive and learning impairments 
(Ogren et al., 2008), whereas 5-HT2AR activation is associated 
with improvements in certain aspects of cognition and learning 
(Gimpl et al., 1979; Harvey, 1996, 2003; Harvey et al., 2004, 2012; 
King et al., 1974; Romano et al., 2006, 2010; Welsh et al., 1998; 
Zhang and Stackman, 2015; Zhang et al., 2016) as well as an 
unlearning or ‘extinction’ learning (Zhang et al., 2013). Serotonin 
2A receptor activation has also been associated with neurogenesis 
(Catlow et al., 2013; Cavus and Duman, 2003; Frankel and Cun-
ningham, 2002; Gewirtz et al., 2002; Jones et al., 2009; Meller 
et al., 2002; Niitsu et al., 1995; Vaidya et al., 1997), particularly in 
the cortex (Gewirtz et al., 2002; Jones et al., 2009; Vaidya et al., 
1997) (but not in the hippocampus (Vaidya et al., 1997)), which 
may explain the type of cognitive and learning enhancements that 
are associated with its functioning (e.g. associative learning). Spe-
cifically, a number of studies have shown enhancements of asso-
ciative learning with 5-HT2AR agonism and impairments with its 
blockade (Barre et al., 2016; Harvey, 1996, 2003; Harvey et al., 
2004; Romano et al., 2000, 2006; Welsh et al., 1998).
Cognitive flexibility in humans is thought to be positively mod-
ulated by 5-HT2AR functioning (Boulougouris et al., 2008) and 
there is evidence to suggest that 5-HT2AR agonists (such as LSD 
and psilocybin) enhance cognitive flexibility and creative thinking 
(Frecska et al., 2012; Harman et al., 1966; Janiger and Dobkin de 
Rios, 1989; King et al., 1974; MacLean et al., 2011; McGlothlin 
et al., 1967; Sessa, 2008), potentially in an enduring way (MacLean 
et al., 2011). Serotonin depletion and inactivation has been shown 
to impair cognitive flexibility (Clarke et al., 2004, 2007; Matias 
et al., 2017) and there is evidence that this may be due to decreased 
basal activation of 5-HT2ARs (Boulougouris et al., 2008; Furr 
et al., 2012). Serotonin neurons have been found to activate when 
animals experience a surprising violation of assumptions, inde-
pendent of its reward-related implications (Matias et al., 2017), 
supporting the association between 5-HT, environmental sensitiv-
ity and adaptability (Branchi, 2011). Our argument here is that 
5-HT2AR signalling is the key mediator of this effect. Promotion 
of plasticity via 5-HT2AR signalling is central to our thesis that, 
along with improving stress-tolerance, a key function of brain ser-
otonin transmission is to engage processes necessary for change, 
when change is necessary. Note: although we acknowledge it 
would be pertinent and potentially valuable, a more in-depth dis-
cussion of the 5-HT2AR and animal and human behavioural meas-
ures of cognitive flexibility is beyond the scope of this paper.
Serotonin, depression and mood
Evidence for an association between serotonin and mood. Sero-
tonin was first isolated and named in the late 1940s (Rapport et al., 
1948) and subsequently found in the brain in the early 1950s (Gad-
dum, 1953; Twarog and Page, 1953). At the same time, scientists 
were beginning to identify interactions between serotonin and the 
recently discovered lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) (Gaddum, 
1953; Shaw and Woolley, 1956). Struck by LSD’s remarkable 
potency (psychoactive in doses as low as 20 µg) and powerful modu-
latory effects on mood and cognition (Busch and Johnson, 1950; 
Hofmann, 1980), it was speculated that abnormal serotoninergic 
functioning may underlie certain mental disorders (Gaddum, 1957; 
Woolley and Shaw, 1954). Although the ‘psychotomimetic’ (mim-
icking psychosis) properties of LSD and related psychedelics were 
recognised in the 1950s and 60s (Isbell et al., 1959), as they are 
today (Carhart-Harris et al., 2013a, 2016c), these compounds were 
also used extensively as psychotherapeutic aids for the treatment of 
a range of disorders, including depression and anxiety (Grinspoon 
and Bakalar, 1979; Sandison, 1954; Sandison and Hopkin, 1964).
The earliest and most direct evidence for the involvement of 
monoamines in mood regulation however, came with the obser-
vation that reserpine, which depletes 5-HT and noradrenaline in 
the brain (Pletscher et al., 1955), also induces depressed mood in 
some individuals (Achor et al., 1955) – see also (Antkiewicz-
Michaluk et al., 2014). This observation was closely followed by 
the discovery of the antidepressant properties of the monoamine 
oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (Udenfriend et al., 1957) and subse-
quently the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (Axelrod and 
Inscoe, 1963; Kuhn, 1958) – both of which increase synaptic 
monoamines (Gur et al., 1999; Matos et al., 1990). More specific 
evidence for the involvement of 5-HT in depression came from 
studies showing a combined antidepressant effect with an MAOI 
plus tryptophan, the biochemical precursor to 5-HT (Coppen 
et al., 1963; Hess and Doepfner, 1961; Pare, 1965).
The idea that serotonergic mechanisms are involved in the 
pathogenesis and treatment of depression was controversial in 
the 1960s (Coppen, 1969, 1967); however, it gradually gained 
traction in the 1980s and into the 1990s with the development 
and licensing of the SSRIs (Carlsson, 1981; Cowen and 
Browning, 2015) and particularly fluoxetine (Bremner, 1984). 
When chronically administered, SSRIs increase concentrations 
of synaptic 5-HT (Smith et al., 2000) by blocking its reuptake 
(Carlsson, 1981), show superior efficacy to placebo in depression 
(Horder et al., 2011; Hieronymus et al., 2016; Barth et al., 2016) 
and are safer than MAOIs and TCAs (Pletscher, 1991). Another 
important finding supporting the involvement of serotonin in 
depression was the observation that acute tryptophan depletion 
can induce a (transient) relapse in symptoms in formerly 
depressed patients (Smith et al., 1997) and plasma tryptophan 
levels have been found to be low in patients with severe depres-
sion (Anderson et al., 1990), potentially owing to inflammation-
related mechanisms (Wichers et al., 2005).
 Carhart-Harris and Nutt

The involvement of serotonin in mood regulation is further 
substantiated by the fact that the potent mood-enhancing agent, 
MDMA, has marked 5-HT releasing properties (Bradbury et al., 
2013). In rodents, MDMA is also a noradrenaline (NA) and dopa-
mine (DA) releaser (Kankaanpaa et al., 1998) but its 5-HT releas-
ing properties are far more pronounced (Bradbury et al., 2013; 
Golembiowska et al., 2016). Blockade of the serotonin transporter 
by pre-treatment with the SSRI citalopram, significantly attenu-
ated the signature positive mood effects of MDMA (Liechti and 
Vollenweider, 2000, 2001) – presumably via preventing MDMA 
from interacting with the 5-HT transporter. Pre-treatment with the 
D2 antagonist haloperidol also attenuated the positive mood effects 
of MDMA (Liechti and Vollenweider, 2001) – suggesting that 
combined DA and 5-HT functioning may have a synergistic influ-
ence on mood. However, in a separate study, combining the DA 
reuptake blocker methylphenidate with MDMA did not have a 
supplementary influence on positive mood (Hysek et al., 2014b) 
and stimulants with greater DA than 5-HT releasing properties 
(such as amphetamine, cocaine and methylphenidate) do not 
induce the same pro-empathy and pro-social sentiments as well as 
frank euphoria that can be attributed to MDMA (Bedi et al., 2014; 
Schmid et al., 2014). The sudden popularity of mephedrone as a 
party-drug in the early 2010s (Carhart-Harris et al., 2011), may be 
explained by its pronounced serotonin-releasing properties 
(Golembiowska et al., 2016), in conjunction with DA release 
(Kehr et al., 2011), with users likening its euphoric effect to that of 
MDMA (Carhart-Harris et al., 2011). Like MDMA, mephedrone 
causes massive 5-HT release that far exceeds its still considerable 
DA releasing properties (Golembiowska et al., 2016).
In summary, there is a wealth of evidence that 5-HT is 
involved in the regulation of mood but exactly how it does this is 
not properly understood (Dayan and Huys, 2015). A central 
theme of this paper is that the combination of 5-HT1A and 
5-HT2A receptor signalling has a complementary effect on mood 
by promoting stress moderation and patience (predominantly 
5-HT1AR mediated) and plasticity and open-mindedness (pre-
dominantly 5-HT2AR mediated). For the remainder of the paper, 
these ideas will be unpacked, first with a focus on postsynaptic 
5-HT1AR signalling, before addressing the function of 5-HT2AR 
signalling in detail.
Postsynaptic 5-HT1AR signalling and mood. The importance 
of postsynaptic 5-HT1AR receptor signalling in the therapeutic 
action of serotonergic antidepressants has been convincingly 
demonstrated (Blier and Ward, 2003; Blier et al., 1997). Selec-
tive 5-HT1AR agonists appear to work in a similar way to tradi-
tional serotonergic antidepressants (Lucki, 1991), i.e. with a 
delayed onset of action of 7–14 days due to the gradual desensi-
tisation of the presynaptic 5-HT1A autoreceptors (Blier and 
Ward, 2003). Subsequent to autoreceptor desensitisation (Le 
Poul et al., 1995), 5-HT1AR agonists (such as buspirone) appear 
to act in the same stress-reducing way as has been described for 
the SSRIs, and this may explain their therapeutic value as anxio-
lytics (Beneytez et al., 1998; Celada et al., 2013a; Chilmonczyk 
et al., 2015; Gordon and Hen, 2004; Jolas et al., 1995; Koek 
et al., 1998; Li et al., 2006; Plaznik et al., 1994; Strauss et al., 
2013). Moreover, 5-HT1AR knock-out rodents exhibit greater 
levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms (Heisler et al., 1998; 
Ramboz et al., 1998), presumably due to deficient postsynaptic 
5-HT1AR-signalling (e.g. in limbic regions).
Determining the importance of the 5-HT1AR to the mecha-
nisms of action of MDMA and classic psychedelics is difficult, due 
to the unavailability of selective 5-HT1AR antagonists for human 
research which could be given as blocking agents. The non-selec-
tive weak 5-HT1AR antagonist pindolol had a negligible influence 
on MDMA’s positive mood effects in one study (van Wel et al., 
2012) but slightly attenuated them in another (Hasler et al., 2009). 
Pindolol slightly augmented the psychoactive effects of the classic 
psychedelic and 5-HT2AR agonist dimethyltryptamine (DMT) 
(Strassman, 1996), and the 5-HT1AR partial agonist buspirone 
significantly attenuated the psychoactive effects of psilocybin 
(Pokorny et al., 2016). The lack of pharmacological selectivity 
and/or only partial agonism and weak antagonism of buspirone 
and pindolol (respectively) preclude us from making strong infer-
ences about their effects in pre-treatment studies, although broadly 
speaking, they support a view that postsynaptic 1A receptor signal-
ling is only mildly (Hasler et al., 2009) and unreliably (van Wel 
et al., 2012) involved in MDMA’s positive mood effects but may 
significantly attenuate some of the key psychological effects of 
classic psychedelics (Pokorny et al., 2016; Strassman, 1996). 
Supporting this latter inference, depletion of brain serotonin aug-
ments the behavioural effects of LSD in animals (Harvey et al., 
1975) and humans (Resnick et al., 1965) and this effect may be 
explained in part by lower postsynaptic 5-HT1AR signalling ena-
bling an exaggerated effect at the 5-HT2A receptor, although an 
adaptive, homeostatic upregulation of 5-HT2AR availability due 
to low synaptic 5-HT may be another mechanism (Jennings et al., 
2008, 2016). Note also that 5-HT1AR expression is low in the 
visual cortex (Figure 1) which may explain why 5-HT2AR agonist 
psychedelics have pronounced visual perceptual effects – i.e. 
because the excitatory effects of 5-HT2AR agonism go unopposed 
(by 5-HT1AR signalling) in this region.
Further considering the contribution of 5-HT1AR signalling 
to MDMA’s acute effects, it is notable that marked changes in 
cerebral blood flow and functional connectivity in limbic struc-
tures (that exhibit the richest expression of 5-HT1A receptors in 
the forebrain) were observed with acute MDMA administration 
(Carhart-Harris et al., 2015b), and MDMA’s characteristic pro-
social effects were significantly attenuated by pre-treatment with 
a selective 5-HT1AR antagonist in rats (Hunt et al., 2011) 
(although see Pitts et al., 2017). The development of new PET 
ligands sensitive to 5-HT release may prove useful in determin-
ing the contribution of different receptor subtypes to the psycho-
logical effects of MDMA and other potent serotonergic drugs 
(Jorgensen et al., 2016; Tyacke and Nutt, 2015). However, in 
brief, it is our assumption that the effects of MDMA reflect com-
bined signalling at postsynaptic 5-HT1AR, 5-HT2AR and cat-
echolamine receptors (i.e. DA and NA) to produce a state of 
improved stress tolerability (5-HT1AR-mediated) combined 
with increased cognitive flexibility and emotional lability 
(5-HT2AR-mediated) and enhanced focus, motivation and confi-
dence (NA/DA receptor mediated) that in combination, is espe-
cially conducive to positive mood (Sessa, 2016).
5-HT2AR signalling, depression and mood. It has been conven-
tion in neuropsychopharmacology to view 5-HT2AR agonism as 
potentially harmful (or at least unconducive) to mental health. The 
main arguments for this are: (1) 5-HT2AR agonists, such as LSD 
and psilocybin, are psychotomimetics (i.e. psychosis models) (Cur-
ran et al., 2009; Gerber and Tonegawa, 2004); and (2) a number of 
 1100 
Journal of Psychopharmacology 31(9)
antidepressants (Carpenter et al., 1999) as well as many antipsy-
chotics (Meltzer, 2012) have 5-HT2AR antagonist properties. 
However, recent studies have begun to challenge the notion that 
5-HT2AR agonism is an undesirable property for a psychotropic 
medication (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016c; Griffiths and Grob, 2010; 
Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b; Qesseveur et al., 2016; Petit et al., 
2014 – see Carhart-Harris and Goodwin, 2017 for a review) – and 
about their harm, comparative rating scales suggest 5-HT2AR ago-
nist psychedelics like psilocybin are among the least harmful drugs 
of potential misuse (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2013; Nutt et al., 
2010; van Amsterdam et al., 2015). Moreover, an increasing num-
ber of studies are reporting enduring positive mental health out-
comes (Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Bouso et al., 2012; Gasser et al., 
2014; Grob et al., 2011; Hendricks et al., 2015b; Osorio Fde et al., 
2015) and psychological well-being (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016c; 
Griffiths et al., 2008) with administration and use of 5-HT2AR ago-
nist psychedelics. Additionally, several studies have found associa-
tions between 5-HT2AR polymorphisms and SSRI response (Kishi 
et al., 2010; McMahon et al., 2006; Wilkie et al., 2009), although it 
is unclear if alleles predicting better response are associated with 
more or less 5-HT2AR functioning. Potentially, resolving this, 
however, a recent study suggested that 5-HT2AR signalling is an 
important (and therefore underappreciated) component of antide-
pressant action of SSRIs (Qesseveur et al., 2016).
Supporting the principle that 5-HT2AR agonism is a viable 
antidepressant target, are the growing number of studies demon-
strating the antidepressant potential of 5-HT2AR agonist psych-
edelics (Baumeister et al., 2014; Buchborn et al., 2014; 
Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b; Griffiths et al., 2016; Grob et al., 
2011; Osorio Fde et al., 2015; Ross et al., 2016; Sanches et al., 
2016 – see Carjart-Harris and Goodwin, 2017 for a review). For 
example, a recent pilot study by our team reported rapid and 
enduring improvements in depressive symptoms after two treat-
ment sessions with psilocybin in patients with treatment-resistant 
depression (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b). The results of this 
study are consistent with those of others reporting reduced 
depressive symptoms in depressed patients treated with aya-
huasca (Osorio Fde et al., 2015; Sanches et al., 2016) and end-of-
life anxiety patients treated with psilocybin (Griffiths et al., 
2016; Grob et al., 2011; Ross et al., 2016), as well as a population 
study showing lower rates of psychological distress and suicidal-
ity in relation to psychedelic drug use (Hendricks et al., 2015b). 
Taken together, these findings motivate a revision of the conven-
tional view that psychedelics are harmful to mental health 
(Hendricks et al., 2015b), and encourage a rethink on the role of 
5-HT2AR signalling in the pharmacology of depression (see also 
(Petit et al., 2014; Qesseveur et al., 2016).
Further support for a positive association between 5-HT2AR 
signalling and (trait) psychological health comes from human 
PET imaging work that has shown a positive relationship between 
5-HT2AR binding and trait neuroticism (Frokjaer et al., 2008), 
pessimism (Bhagwagar et al., 2006; Meyer et al., 2003) and per-
sonality disorder (Soloff et al., 2007; Rosell et al., 2010). Cortical 
5-HT2AR expression is sensitive to basal 5-HT concentrations 
(Cahir et al., 2007; Jorgensen et al., 2016), with 5-HT2A recep-
tors becoming more populous and/or available in response to 
reduced synaptic 5-HT (Cahir et al., 2007; Jennings et al., 2008; 
Jorgensen et al., 2016) and less available in response to increased 
synaptic 5-HT (Jorgensen et al., 2016; Meyer et al., 2001). Thus, 
increased 5-HT2AR binding and associated pessimistic thinking 
(Bhagwagar et al., 2006; Meyer et al., 2003) may be a corollary 
of deficient 5-HT2AR signalling – and the enduring increases in 
optimism that have been observed with LSD (Carhart-Harris 
et al., 2016c) may be viewed as evidence of extreme 5-HT2AR 
signalling having a lasting impact on positive thinking (Carhart-
Harris et al., 2016c).
Postmortem studies showing increased 5-HT2AR availability 
in unmedicated depressed patients (Shelton et al., 2009) and sui-
cide victims (Anisman et al., 2008; Pandey et al., 2002; Stanley 
and Mann, 1983; Turecki et al., 1999) could be viewed as con-
sistent with the hypothesis that there is an adaptive upregulation 
of 5-HT2A receptors in response to deficient 5-HT2AR signal-
ling in depression. The existent of discrepant findings (e.g. 
decreased 5-HT2AR availability in depression and suicide vic-
tims) that challenge this hypothesis may be explained by the con-
founding influence of antidepressant and other psychiatric 
medications – which reverse this relationship by downregulating 
5-HT2AR availability (Attar-Levy et al., 1999; Dean et al., 2014; 
Gray and Roth, 2001; Muguruza et al., 2014; van Heeringen 
et al., 2003; Yatham et al., 1999).
Electroconvulsive shock and 5-HT2AR functioning. The 
effect of electroconvulsive shock (ECS) on 5-HT2AR densities 
and functioning is important to address, particularly given the 
notable efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in terms of 
reducing depressive symptoms for a period (UK ECT Review 
Group, 2003). Interestingly, we have recently found that func-
tional brain changes one day after psilocybin for treatment-resis-
tant depression compare best with those of ECT (Carhart-Harris 
et al., 2017b). For example, as with ECT (Bolwig, 2015), the 
post-psilocybin treatment brain changes were the inverse of what 
is typically seen during the acute psilocybin experience itself 
(Carhart-Harris et al., 2017b). More specifically, whereas resting 
state functional connectivity in the default-mode network is sig-
nificantly decreased during the acute psychedelic experience 
(Carhart-Harris et al., 2016), it is increased (or ‘normalised’) one 
day after psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression – and this 
effect is greatest in treatment responders (Carhart-Harris et al., 
2017b). Increased or ‘normalised’ DMN RSFC has also been 
seen after successful treatment with ECT (Mulders et al., 2016).
Early rat work revealed increased 5-HT2AR functioning 
(Moorman et al., 1996) and cortical 5-HT2AR expression after 
ECS (Burnet et al., 1995, 1999; Butler et al., 1993) – an effect that 
appeared to be relatively selective for the 5-HT2AR in relation to 
other serotonin receptor subtypes (Burnet et al., 1999). However, 
contradictory findings have since been observed in primates 
(Strome et al., 2005) and humans (Yatham et al., 2010) with 
5-HT2AR binding showing decreased post ECS/ECT. This down-
regulation of 5-HT2AR densities post ECT is more consistent with 
the effects of conventional antidepressant medications (Yatham 
et al., 1999) – as well as classic psychedelics (Buckholtz et al., 
1990) – and also makes more logical sense given the marked 5-HT 
release that is associated with ECS (Zis et al., 1992).
How do we explain the observed 5-HT2AR upregulation in rats 
however? Stress has been found to increase 5-HT2AR density 
(Katagiri et al., 2001) and affinity (Harvey et al., 2003) in rats. 
Extreme stress is hypothesised to engage ‘pathway 2’ in our bipar-
tite model, which is mediated by 5-HT2AR signalling, and charac-
terised by a rapid plasticity – serving to facilitate major change in 
conditions of extreme adversity. Although speculative, one inter-
pretation of the upregulated 5-HT2AR functioning post ECS in rats, 
is that it is a consequence of the extreme stress (‘shock’) of the 
 Carhart-Harris and Nutt 
1101
procedure in this species. It might also be worth noting that ECT 
has been found to promote neural plasticity (Bouckaert et al. 2014; 
Joshi et al. 2016), and so is consistent with pathway 2 in this regard. 
5-HT2A agonists and antagonists as antidepressants: 
resolving a paradox. Some effective drugs for depression 
(such as mirtazapine) have 5-HT2AR antagonist properties 
(Watanabe et al., 2008) and 5-HT2AR antagonist antipsychotic 
drugs (such as risperidone and olanzapine) have been found to 
augment the antidepressant efficacy of SSRIs in treatment-
resistant depression (Marangell et al., 2002; Ostroff and Nel-
son, 1999; Shelton and Papakostas, 2008). This has led some to 
consider 5-HT2AR antagonism a treatment target in depression 
(Pandey et al., 2010) but this matter requires some careful 
thought, not least because 5-HT2AR antagonism presents addi-
tional side-effects to those of first-line antidepressants such as 
SSRIs (Jarema, 2007; Shelton and Papakostas, 2008; Teegarden 
et al., 2008). To our knowledge, selective 5-HT2AR antagonists 
have not been trialled as stand-alone treatments for depression, 
and have largely failed as stand-alone treatments for schizo-
phrenia (Ebdrup et al., 2011), so their efficacy appears to be 
predicated on the augmentation of other pharmacological 
mechanisms. For example, blocking postsynaptic 5-HT2ARs in 
the mPFC may lessen the ability of top-down circuits to inhibit 
the firing of serotonergic neurons in the midbrain (potentially 
leading to increased 5-HT efflux) (Artigas, 2013a), and 
5-HT2AR blockade more generally, may encourage a preferen-
tial effect of 5-HT on its postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. Con-
sidered in this way, the effects of 5-HT2AR antagonism could 
be perceived as supplementing the stress moderation effects of 
postsynaptic 5-HT1AR agonism, and so pathway 1 in our bipar-
tite model (Figure 3). Moreover, 5-HT2AR antagonists have 
mild pro-sleep/sedating properties (Idzikowski et al., 1987; 
Teegarden et al., 2008; Vanover and Davis, 2010) that could 
complement the stress moderating effects of SSRIs.
A likely solution to the paradox that 5-HT2AR agonists and 
antagonists have antidepressant properties is that they achieve 
the same outcome but via different routes. Whereas 5-HT2AR 
antagonism supplements the emotionally moderating effects 
associated with postsynaptic 5-HT1AR signalling (pathway 1), 
5-HT2AR agonism may work to enhance plasticity, adaptability 
and the capacity for change. Both mechanisms can be viewed as 
adaptive responses to adverse conditions, with potentially con-
sistent outcomes, albeit achieved via different, perhaps even anti-
thetical mechanisms.
Acute versus longer-term mood effects of 5-HT2AR signal-
ling. The paradox that 5-HT2AR agonist psychedelics can be 
acutely psychotomimetic (Carhart-Harris et al., 2013a; Gou-
zoulis-Mayfrank et al., 2005) and yet have long-term beneficial 
effects on well-being (Griffiths et al., 2006) and mental health 
(Carhart-Harris et al., 2016a; Griffiths et al., 2008; Hendricks 
et al., 2015b) has previously been discussed (Carhart-Harris 
et al., 2016c). In brief, it has been proposed that the acute state 
produced by 5-HT2AR agonist psychedelics does not directly 
modulate the valence of mood, i.e. it does not directly promote 
either positive or negative mood (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016c). 
This argument could be contested on the basis that positive 
mood effects are often seen with acute administration of psy-
chedelics (Schmid et al., 2015) and the positive mood effects of 
Figure 3. A two-part or ‘bipartite’ model of brain serotonin function. Model proposes that brain serotonin mediates adaptive responses to 
adversity via two distinct mechanisms: one mediated by postsynaptic 5-HT1AR signalling in aid of stress moderation (pathway 1) and the other 
mediated by 5-HT2AR signalling is aid of more substantial adaptive changes (pathway 2). SSRIs and other conventional antidepressant medications 
work on and can enhance pathway 1, whereas pathway 2 can be enhanced by 5-HT2AR agonist psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin. Note: it is 
hypothesised that active coping can be most effectively implemented if the window of plasticity afforded by 5-HT2AR agonism is complemented by 
supportive psychotherapy that promotes a willingness to confront and work through sources of stress (Watts et al., 2017). Illustrations by Samantha

MDMA (van Wel et al., 2012), LSD (Preller, 2016), psilocybin 
(Kometer et al., 2012) and ayahuasca (Valle et al., 2016) are all 
attenuated by pre-treatment with a 5-HT2AR antagonist, as are 
the pro-social effects of MDMA (Pitts et al., 2017). However, 
anxiety and psychosis-like symptoms are also often seen acutely 
with psychedelics (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016c) and these can 
also be attenuated by 5-HT2AR antagonism (Vollenweider 
et al., 1998). Moreover, in studies that found enhanced mood 
with psychedelics, psychological preparation and support was 
generally provided, which helps channel the experience in a 
positive direction. Similarly, volunteers may have had positive 
expectations about their experience that biased their appraisal 
of the acute experience. These matters are relevant to our extra-
pharmacological model presented above (Figure 2), as well as 
the enhanced environmental sensitivity model proposed for 
serotonin itself (Branchi, 2011) and 5-HT2AR signalling more 
specifically (pathway 2, Figure 3).
One proposed solution to this apparent paradox, is that the 
acute and longer-term effects of psychedelics are distinct, with 
the acute effects being marked by emotional arousal and lability 
(Carhart-Harris et al., 2016c; Kaelen et al., 2015) rather than 
positive mood per se, and longer-term changes are more reliably 
biased towards positive mood (perhaps somewhat analogous to 
near-death experiences (Greyson, 2008)) with improvements in 
psychological well-being (Griffiths et al., 2006; Hendricks et al., 
2015a, 2015b), optimism (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016c) and open-
ness (MacLean et al., 2011). The importance of emotional break-
through after acute struggle may be highly relevant in this context 
(Watts et al., 2017), as may the occurrence of peak-type experi-
ences (Roseman et al., 2017a), both topics we intend to study 
more closely in the future. Agonist-induced 5-HT2AR downreg-
ulation may also play a significant role (Buckholtz et al., 1990), 
at least during the after-glow period 1–2 weeks post exposure 
(Winkelman, 2014).
This is a complex problem for future studies to dissect. 
However, one way we may begin to inform on it, is to address the 
question of whether the acute and longer-term responses to 
psychedelics relate to each other – and indeed, there is already 
ample evidence that they do (Carhart-Harris et al., 2017a; 
Griffiths et al., 2016; Roseman et al., 2017a; Ross et al., 2016). A 
recent questionnaire study found that the psychological difficulty 
of an acute psychedelic experience was predictive of longer-term 
improvements in well-being (Carbonaro et al., 2016), although 
the same study also found that the duration of such difficulty was 
predictive of long-term decreases in well-being (Carbonaro et al., 
2016). A number of studies have found that especially intense 
psychedelic experiences predict positive long-term outcomes – 
particularly if they contain phenomena consistent with so-called 
‘mystical’ (Stace, 1961) or ‘peak’ (Maslow, 1970) experiences 
(Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Griffiths et al., 2008, 2016; Johnson 
et al., 2016; Ross et al., 2016). Moreover, a recent LSD neuroim-
aging study by our team found that acute ‘entropic’ brain changes 
under the drug (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014b) were predictive of 
long-term increases in the personality trait ‘openness’ (Lebedev 
et al., 2016). As highlighted in our EP model (Figure 2), it is 
important that we try to better understand how extra-pharmaco-
logical factors may interact with a drug’s direct pharmacological 
effects to determine the quality of an acute drug experience and 
ensuing long-term effects – and this is especially pertinent in the 
context of psychedelics.
The function of brain 5-HT2AR 
signalling
5-HT2AR mediated plasticity
There is a growing body of evidence that enhanced 5-HT2AR 
signalling produces a plastic state (in the sense of an enhanced 
capacity for change), both psychologically (Boulougouris et al., 
2008; Carhart-Harris et al., 2015a, 2016c; Clarke et al., 2007; 
Kaelen et al., 2015; Kuypers et al., 2016) and neurobiologically 
(Azmitia, 2001; Barre et al., 2016; Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a, 
2014b, 2016c; Gewirtz et al., 2002; Lebedev et al., 2016; 
Tagliazucchi et al., 2016; Vaidya et al., 1997; Yoshinaga et al., 
2013). We propose that this 5-HT2AR-mediated plasticity is of 
fundamental importance to the acute and longer-term action of 
5-HT2AR agonist psychedelics, potentially explaining their idi-
osyncratic phenomenology and remarkable behavioural effects 
– including their ability to elicit long-term beneficial (Carhart-
Harris et al., 2016a; Griffiths et al., 2011; Hendricks et al., 
2015a), and (albeit less common) harmful changes (Lerner and 
Lev-Ran, 2015; Cohen, 1966; Iaria et al., 2010).
Plasticity and the entropic brain
The proposal that psychedelics induce a plastic state is consistent 
with the ‘entropic brain’ hypothesis, introduced by us in 2014 
(Carhart-Harris et al., 2014b). This idea emerged out of observa-
tions of consistencies between neuroimaging findings on the action 
of psychedelics (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014b; Muthukumaraswamy 
et al., 2013) and a sense that their physical (brain) effects recapitu-
late their psychological effects – and vice versa. Inspired by Karl 
Friston’s Free-Energy principle (Friston, 2010), the information 
theory-based measure of entropy was applied to the psychedelic 
state in an effort to capture its essential phenomenological and neu-
rophysiological qualities. Entropy is formally both uncertainty and 
unpredictability (Ben-Naim, 2007) – and not coincidentally, these 
terms possess meaning in both a mechanistic and subjective sense. 
A growing number of analyses are now endorsing the principle that 
the brain exhibits increased entropy under psychedelics (Atasoy, 
2017; Carhart-Harris et al., 2014b; Lebedev et al., 2016; Schartner 
et al., 2017; Tagliazucchi E, 2014; Viol, 2016) (see also Gallimore, 
2015) and countless other human and animal studies by independ-
ent teams, despite not formally measuring entropy, report findings 
that are consistent with the entropic brain principle (Celada et al., 
2013b; Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013; Riba et al., 2004, 2014; 
Wood et al., 2012).
Entropy exists most purely as an index of uncertainty (Ben-
Naim, 2007) but its origins lie in thermodynamics (Ben-Naim, 
2007, 2008). Entropy is perhaps most familiar to people in the 
context of thermodynamics and specifically how it relates to the 
second law: that isolated systems tend towards disorder, or exhibit 
increased entropy over time (i.e. decay). The relationship between 
information theory-based entropy and thermodynamic entropy is 
a formal one, with the latter being merely an applied and contex-
tualised version of the former (Ben-Naim, 2007, 2008).
In the context of 5-HT2AR signalling and how this may inform 
on the function of brain serotonin, one may think of enhancing 
5-HT2AR signalling as analogous to increasing the temperature 
(or excitability) of the brain; indeed, the excitatory effect of 
5-HT2AR signalling has long been recognised (Aghajanian and 
 Carhart-Harris and Nutt 
1103
Marek, 1999; Celada et al., 2013b). Extending this analogy to the 
process of annealing (i.e. whereby a metal is heated to make it 
more malleable) – one may think of 5-HT2AR signalling as func-
tioning to induce an entropic state characterised by enhanced flex-
ibility and malleability during which work can be done that, upon 
cooling, may leave a lasting change (Gopnik, 2010). Viewed 
through the lens of the popular Bayesian brain model of brain 
function (Knill and Pouget, 2004), one could see this 5-HT2AR-
mediated entropic state as working to ‘reset’ reinforced priors in 
depression – such as pessimistic beliefs and negative self-percep-
tions (Moutoussis et al., 2014). See Carhart-Harris et al. (2017b) 
for recent neurobiological support for this idea.
5-HT2AR induced plasticity mediates 
environmental sensitivity
The evolutionary value of neural and behavioural plasticity is 
well recognised (Belsky and Pluess, 2013; Boyce and Ellis, 
2005), and in this context, the plasticity-mediating role of seroto-
nin is becoming increasingly well appreciated (Alboni et al., 
2017; Belsky et al., 2009; Branchi, 2011; Chiarotti et al., 2017). 
The importance of plasticity for learning has obvious functional 
value: in early life, when behaviour and cognition require consid-
erable refinement but also in extreme adversity, when major 
behavioural change may be necessary for survival.
Serotonin is known to play a vital role in brain development 
(Azmitia, 2001; Kepser and Homberg, 2015; Lambe et al., 2011) 
and has been found to reverse processes of maturation, both at the 
cellular (Kobayashi et al., 2010; Maya Vetencourt et al., 2008) 
and brain network level (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016d; 
Tagliazucchi et al., 2016) in both cases likely via 5-HT2AR 
related mechanisms. Regarding 5-HT2AR signalling, fMRI stud-
ies have shown that LSD and psilocybin temporarily reverse pro-
cesses of network integration and segregation that characterise 
the developing brain (Wylie et al., 2014), and this ‘brain regres-
sion’ is mirrored at the psychological level by a psychological 
regression that is characteristic of the psychedelic state (Carhart-
Harris et al., 2016d; Roseman et al., 2014; Tagliazucchi et al., 
2016). Consistently, processes of neuronal differentiation that 
occur during development were found to be aided by 5-HT1AR 
signalling but inhibited by 5-HT2AR signalling (Azmitia, 2001).
Crucially, 5-HT2AR signalling has been found to be highly 
influential during early development (Beique et al., 2004; Zhang, 
2003) and to be maximal during key developmental periods 
(Lambe et al., 2011) suggesting that 5-HT2AR-mediated plastic-
ity facilitates the intense learning that is needed during critical 
periods. Children have been found to demonstrate superior perfor-
mance than adults in certain tasks requiring open-mindedness and 
the ‘de-weighting’ of prior knowledge (Lucas et al., 2014) and 
psychedelics are strongly associated with unconventional think-
ing (Harman et al., 1966; Kuypers et al., 2016), vivid imagery and 
imagination (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012b, 2015a; Kaelen et al., 
2016) and suggestibility (Carhart-Harris et al., 2015a).
Trend decreases in openness appear to occur with maturation 
(Costa and McCrae, 1988) and 5-HT2AR availability is known to 
markedly decrease once adulthood has been reached (Sheline 
et al., 2002). Enduring increases in openness have been found 
after psilocybin (MacLean et al., 2011) and LSD (Carhart-Harris 
et al., 2016c) – remarkable findings given that personality is 
normally highly stable in adulthood. Trait absorption, which is 
related to openness and a susceptibility to become immersed and 
absorbed in one’s inner or outer world (Ott, 2006; Parsons et al., 
2015; Tellegen and Atkinson, 1974), has been found to: (1) predict 
sensitivity to psilocybin’s acute effects (Studerus et al., 2012), and 
(2) be associated with a polymorphism linked to stronger 
5-HT2AR binding (Ott et al., 2005).
There is likely to be an optimal level of cognitive and psycho-
logical flexibility for a given context (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014b) 
and high doses of psychedelics risk overshooting this through 
extreme 5-HT2AR signalling causing an excessive flexibility that 
is unconducive to accurate reality testing and conventional cogni-
tion and behaviour (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014b). Interestingly, 
recent anecdotal reports suggest that semi-regular use of very low 
doses of psychedelics (referred to colloquially as ‘micro-dosing’) 
may facilitate creative problem solving and improve mood 
(Gregoire, 2016; Waldman, 2017) – a claim that urgently requires 
empirical verification through controlled research. Reports of 
‘over-view’ type insights, i.e. an improved ability to see the ‘big-
ger picture’ under psychedelics, are relatively common among 
user, participant and patient reports (Sessa, 2008; Harman et al., 
1966), and ‘aha’ type insights have been described (Grof, 1975; 
Sandison and Hopkin, 1964; Watts et al., 2017). Moreover, acute 
insight experienced during treatment with psilocybin for treat-
ment-resistant depression was recently found to be predictive of 
positive long-term clinical outcomes (Carhart-Harris et al., 
2017a). If evidence for psychedelic-induced insight is substanti-
ated by further research, this will have interesting implications for 
our understanding of optimal cognition (Carhart-Harris et al., 
2014b) and the science of nootropics (Froestl et al., 2014).
Relatedly, more work is required to test the reliability of the 
recent finding that psychedelics tune the brain closer to criticality 
(Atasoy et al., 2017), and what the functional and therapeutic 
implications of this might be. Critical systems are known to be 
maximally sensitive to perturbation (Bak, 1997), and although 
speculative, this could account for the high sensitivity to the 
environment that is characteristic of the psychedelic state 
(Hartogsohn, 2016).
Much has been written about differential vulnerability to stress 
in medicine and psychiatry, e.g. the so-called stress-diathesis 
model of mental illness (Morley, 1983). However, recent revi-
sions of this model possess considerable appeal, particularly when 
applied to the context of brain serotonin (Belsky and Pluess, 2009; 
Branchi, 2011). According to these revised models, greater sensi-
tivity to the environment may translate into greater well-being if 
conditions be favourable, or vulnerability to mental illness if con-
ditions be adverse (Belsky and Pluess, 2009; Branchi, 2011). The 
involvement of serotoninergic mechanisms in mediating sensitiv-
ity to the environment is supported by gene-environment interac-
tion studies that have linked certain serotonin genotypes to greater 
susceptibility to stress (Caspi et al., 2003). Particular focus has 
been placed on a serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene polymor-
phism, and the finding that the (s/s) allele, associated with lower 
re-uptake and thus higher synaptic 5-HT (Lesch et al., 1996) is 
associated with a greater likelihood of depressive symptoms in 
response to stress (Caspi et al., 2003; Karg et al., 2011; Zammit 
and Owen, 2006) – although see (Mirkovic et al., 2016). Evidence 
of increased plasticity with SSRIs and increased 5-HT transmis-
sion more generally (Mattson et al., 2004) has been used to 
endorse a view that serotonin mediates susceptibility to the 
 1104 
Journal of Psychopharmacology 31(9)
environment (Branchi, 2011) but little has been written about how 
specific 5-HT receptors mediate this effect.
Crucially, 5-HT2AR polymorphisms have been associated 
with: (1) increased sensitivity to stressful and enriching environ-
ments (Dressler et al., 2016; Fiocco et al., 2007;Jiang et al., 2016; 
Jokela et al., 2007; Lebe et al., 2013; Salo et al., 2011); (2) early 
life stress and maternal deprivation increases the availability of 
5-HT2ARs and their sensitivity to excitation (Benekareddy et al., 
2010; Vazquez et al., 2000); (3) time-dependent sensitisation stress 
which models post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in rodents, 
increases 5-HT2AR affinity (Harvey et al., 2003); (4) chronic glu-
cocorticoid administration to rodents increases 5-HT2AR densities 
(Katagiri et al., 2001); (5) 5-HT2AR availability is highest during 
critical development periods (Sheline et al., 2002); (6) 5-HT2AR 
signalling mediates behavioural responses to stress in non-human 
animals (Aloyo and Dave, 2007) and (7) humans experiencing 
psychedelic drug trips are, like children, exquisitely sensitive to 
their environment (Eisner, 1997; Hartogsohn, 2016), with the pro-
vision of a supportive, nurturing environment being strongly advo-
cated for psychedelic ‘trippers’ (Johnson et al., 2008) – as for 
children. In summary, all these findings lend support to the notion 
that a key function of 5-HT2AR signalling is to mediate plasticity 
and associated change, especially in situations where change 
would be functionally advantageous.
5-HT2AR-mediated plasticity: an adaptive 
response to extreme adversity
As discussed earlier (Section 3.2.2), anxiety and stress are potent 
non-pharmacological inducers of 5-HT release (Bland et al., 
2003b; Fujino et al., 2002; Rex et al., 2005). Anxiety and stress 
are most intensely evoked when survival is threatened, and 
accordingly, massive 5-HT release (~250 fold vs. baseline) has 
been detected in the rodent brain during asphyxiation and cardiac 
arrest, and although other neurotransmitters also show a marked 
increase, the increase in 5-HT release was especially marked (Li 
et al., 2015). It has been speculated that elevated levels of the 
endogenous 5-HT2AR agonist psychedelic DMT (Barker et al., 
2012) may account for spontaneously occurring psychedelic-like 
states such as occur in near-death experiences (Strassman, 2000) 
but to our knowledge, empirical evidence for this theory has yet 
to published. Functionally, there is no more extreme condition 
than being proximal to death (if still fully alert). It is intriguing to 
consider what role may be served by enhanced serotonergic func-
tioning during the perceived threat of death, and particularly 
5-HT2AR signalling.
Indeed, similarities between the phenomenology of near-death 
experiences and the psychedelic state (e.g. disturbed time percep-
tion, reliving/autobiographical memory recollection, sudden 
insight, a sense of peace, a sense of interconnectedness and unity, a 
sense of other-worldliness, religious and/or mystical-type feelings 
– which may include a sense of presence or an encounter with (a 
perceived) person or deity of significance, and a message or instruc-
tion (Greyson, 2008; Greyson, 1993; Greyson and Bush, 1992; 
Greyson, 1983)) may rest on similarities in their pharmacology – 
i.e. extreme 5-HT2AR signalling. Similarly, the incipient phase of a 
psychosis – which may be associated with a ‘psychedelic-like’ phe-
nomenology (e.g. a fragmenting self/ego, muddled thinking, bizarre 
thought content, de-realisation, mystical-type experiences and/or 
religious conversation or epiphany, putative insight, magical think-
ing, perceptual disturbances and a sense of dread etc. (Bowers and 
Freedman, 1966; Chapman, 1966)) may also involve exceptionally 
high 5-HT2AR transmission (Gouzoulis-Mayfrank et al., 1998, 
2005;Gouzoulis et al., 1994).
Consistent with the bipartite model we present here (Figure 
3), a stress-induced upregulation of 5-HT2AR signalling as an 
adaptive response to extreme adversity (Benekareddy et al., 
2010; Berton et al., 1998; Harvey et al., 2003; Katagiri et al., 
2001), could be an unacknowledged factor in the pathogenesis of 
psychosis (Gouzoulis-Mayfrank et al., 1998; Gouzoulis et al., 
1994; Holloway et al., 2013). Indeed, if this hypothesis was to 
hold up to empirical testing, it would have important implications 
for how we understand and perhaps treat psychosis. For example, 
it could: (1) imply a role for 5-HT1AR agonism and 5-HT2AR 
antagonism in the moderation of the ‘prodromal state’, and/or (2) 
endorse the importance of providing a highly supportive environ-
ment for the at-risk individual – as is provided for actual drug-
induced psychedelic experiences (Johnson et al., 2008).
Earlier (Section 3.2.2), we discussed the hypothesis that 5-HT 
mediates passive coping (or an improved ability to tolerate stress) 
under adverse conditions via postsynaptic 5-HT1AR signalling. 
Enhanced coping via a moderation of stress may be advantageous 
during difficult conditions but it may also be counterproductive, 
e.g. if it promotes a ready acceptance of these conditions and a 
compromised ability to learn from or strive to change them. 
Conversely, if learning and adaptability are enhanced (e.g. via 
5-HT2AR signalling), then this may confer significant evolution-
ary advantages. Moreover, humans’ remarkable adaptability is 
one of our defining traits – being fundamental to our develop-
ment and thriving as a species (Anton et al., 2014; Stini, 1975).
We propose that an enhanced ability to tolerate stress, medi-
ated by enhanced postsynaptic 5-HT1AR signalling, may be a 
logical, adaptive response to moderate levels of adversity but that 
enhanced adaptability and capacity for change (e.g. in outlook 
and behaviour) mediated by 5-HT2AR signalling may be optimal 
when the level of adversity reaches a critical point – e.g. when 
one’s life is in danger. A number of different experiments could 
be performed to test this hypothesis, with its basic tenets being: 
(1) extremely adverse conditions evoke enhanced 5-HT2AR sig-
nalling, plasticity and propensity for change; (2) 5-HT1AR sig-
nalling dominates serotonin functioning during normal conditions 
and during mild-moderate adversity but 5-HT2AR plays an 
increasingly prominent role as the level of adversity increases to 
a critical point, and concentrations of synaptic 5-HT do similarly 
(e.g. as can be achieved experimentally with extreme stress 
(Amat et al., 2005), or with raphe stimulation (Amargos-Bosch 
et al., 2004; Puig et al., 2005)).
The rapid and transient downregulation of hippocampal 
5-HT1ARs seen with severe acute stress may be one mecha-
nism by which this hypothesised transition to 5-HT2AR domi-
nance under extreme adversity occurs (Berton et al., 1998; 
Lopez et al., 1999), and increased limbic 5-HT release with 
mild stress (Bekris et al., 2005) compared with cortical 5-HT 
release with more intense stress (Amat et al., 2005) may be 
another. Another possibility is that 5-HT2ARs switch from their 
default low-affinity state to a high-affinity state (Glennon et al., 
1988) under conditions of extreme stress. Indeed, this may 
explain why 5-HT2AR density (Katagiri et al., 2001) and affin-
ity (Harvey et al., 2003) are increased under extreme stress in 
 Carhart-Harris and Nutt 
1105
rodents. The development of 5-HT2AR agonist radioligands 
(Ettrup et al., 2014, 2016; Jorgensen et al., 2016) may help us to 
better test for altered 5-HT2AR availability in the human brain 
during extreme stress and to correlate this with state and trait 
psychological variables. Our firm hypothesis would be that 
5-HT2AR binding would be significantly increased in highly 
stressed individuals and that this may relate to psychological 
and neurobiological measures of plasticity.
Serotonin and positive mood
According to the central hypothesis of this paper, the principal 
function of brain serotonin is to facilitate adaptive responses to 
adverse conditions via two distinct pathways. Consequently, like 
much of the literature on the function of brain 5-HT, this paper 
has concentrated on adversity. This approach can be defended on 
a number of grounds: (1) there are plenty of relevant data on 
adversity because it is relatively easy to experimentally induce; 
(2) adverse conditions provide models from which to test experi-
mental treatments; (3) adversity and its behavioural and biologi-
cal corollaries are of central relevance to medicine and psychiatry; 
and, perhaps most critically, (4) negotiating adversity is of funda-
mental evolutionary importance.
Regarding the pharmacology of positive mood, the reliabil-
ity with which potent 5-HT releasers such as MDMA and 
mephedrone induce marked positive mood (Carhart-Harris 
et al., 2011, 2015b) could be seen as supportive of the (albeit 
disputed (Andrews et al., 2015)) association between enhanced 
serotonergic functioning and positive mood. The euphoria 
associated with these compounds is distinct from that associ-
ated with other stimulants that have more pronounced catecho-
lamineric releasing effects – such as methamphetamine (Bedi 
et al., 2014). It is intriguing to consider how much of a contri-
bution 5-HT2AR agonism makes to the euphoric effects of 
MDMA and mephedrone (Schmid et al., 2015), particularly 
since 5-HT2AR antagonism significantly attenuates the posi-
tive mood effects of MDMA (van Wel et al., 2012) and 
5-HT1AR antagonism does this less reliably (van Wel et al., 
2012). PET imaging work utilising potent 5-HT releasers and 
receptor-selective ligands sensitive to this release (Paterson 
et al., 2010, 2013; Tyacke and Nutt, 2015) may be able to shed 
new light on the association between enhanced 5-HT transmis-
sion and positive mood (Jorgensen et al., 2016) that may help 
to disambiguate this matter (Andrews et al., 2015).
It would also be relevant to better understand why more 
selective 5-HT releasers such as fenfluramine do not produce 
the same kind of euphoria associated with MDMA and mephe-
drone, e.g. increased anxiety and decreased positive mood 
were seen with high doses of fenfluramine (Brauer et al., 
1996), although reduced anxiety has also been observed with 
lower doses (Hetem et al., 1996). The contribution of catecho-
lamine release to the MDMA and mephedrone ‘high’ may be 
an important factor, as may the remarkable potency of their 
5-HT release, which is comparatively much greater for MDMA 
and mephedrone (Golembiowska, et al., 2016) than for fenflu-
ramine (Zolkowska et al., 2008). It is also possible that the 
pharmacology of fenfluramine’s metabolite, norfenfluramine, 
which is different to that of its parent compound, e.g. norfen-
fluramine has greater 5-HT2C receptor agonism (Miller, 2005), 
may account for some of its aversive effects. Relatedly, it is 
known that the 5-HT2C receptor agonist mCPP tends to induce 
anxiety and panic (Wood, 2003).
It is important to state that 5-HT2AR agonist psychedelics 
are not hedonic drugs in the classic sense (Carhart-Harris and 
Nutt, 2013). Psychedelics are not habit forming in animals or 
humans (Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016) and typical patterns 
of use are relatively sporadic, with protracted periods of absti-
nence (Nichols, 2004). However, very low (‘micro-doses’) are 
reportedly being taken regularly for (putative) mood and cog-
nition enhancement (Gregoire, 2016; Waldman, 2017) and 
states of extreme positive mood are not infrequently reported 
with larger doses of psychedelics (Schmid et al., 2015), par-
ticularly when taken in supportive environments (Studerus 
et al., 2012) – although marked anxiety and/or dysphoria can 
also occur (Carbonaro et al., 2016). As highlighted in our EP 
model (Figure 2), context is likely to play an important role in 
determining the quality of a psychedelic experience 
(Hartogsohn, 2016; Roseman et al., 2017a) – and positive 
mood associated with 5-HT2AR agonist psychedelics may 
have much to do with positive expectations and environmental 
factors.
This said, it is intriguing to consider the possibility that a 
‘loosened mind’, whether subsequent to enhanced 5-HT2AR sig-
nalling or not, may be a non-negligible component of the neuro-
biology of positive mood itself (Ashby et al., 1999). Blocking the 
5-HT2AR has been found to significantly attenuate the positive 
mood effects of three different classic psychedelics (Kometer 
et al., 2012; Preller, 2016; Valle et al., 2016) and MDMA (van 
Wel et al., 2012), and it is intriguing to consider whether 
5-HT2AR-mediated plasticity may be an underappreciated com-
ponent of the antidepressant action of SSRIs (Chamberlain et al., 
2006; Petit et al., 2014; Qesseveur et al., 2016). Several studies 
have demonstrated a relationship between positive mood and 
creative thinking (De Dreu et al., 2008; Hirt et al., 2008), with 
the elation, flight of ideas and general hyper-creativity of manic 
states being relevant in this context (Jamison, 1994).
‘The secret to happiness is freedom’. (Thucydides c. 450BC)
It is presumed that the brain (like the mind) functions in a freer, 
less constrained manner during creative states, as during positive 
mood (Martindale, 2007) – although this hypothesis needs to be 
better tested (although see Atasoy et al., 2017) – and imaging 
studies with potent serotonergic compounds may help in this 
regard (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a, 2014d, 2015b, 2016d; 
Heifets and Malenka, 2016; Roseman et al., 2014). It is common-
place to refer to depressive states as excessively rigid 
(Holtzheimer and Mayberg, 2011); being characterised by emo-
tional withdrawal and anhedonia, and impaired and pessimisti-
cally biased cognition (Berman et al., 2011; Holtzheimer and 
Mayberg, 2011), whereas the psychedelic experience is often 
described as psychologically liberated (Turton et al., 2014; Watts 
et al., 2017) and functional neuroimaging findings support such a 
description (e.g. Petri et al., 2014). A recent qualitative analysis 
of treatment responses to psilocybin for depression suggested 
that successful treatment response is characterised by a sense of 
having been psychologically ‘reset’, with renewed feelings of 
‘connection’ 
and 
emotional 
‘acceptance’ 
post-treatment 
(Roseman et al., 2017b; Watts et al., 2017). Moreover, pre- 
 
versus post-treatment fMRI data from our psilocybin for 
 1106 
Journal of Psychopharmacology 31(9)
treatment-resistant depression trial suggest a potential neurobio-
logical counterpart to the psychological notion of ‘reset’ (Carhart-
Harris et al., 2017b).
Limitations
It is appropriate to acknowledge some of limitations of this 
review. Only two serotonin receptor subtypes have been dis-
cussed in depth and it would be wrong to dismiss the contribution 
of the others. For example, some relatively new antidepressants 
have an important (antagonist) action at 5-HT2C receptors 
(which has secondary faciliatory effects on DA transmission) 
(MacIsaac et al., 2014) and others, such as vortioxetine, have 
appreciable affinities for several other 5-HT receptors (Riga 
et al., 2016; Thase et al., 2016) – perhaps most notably, the 
5-HT6 receptor (Karila et al., 2015)). Similarly, we did not 
address literature on functional selectivity or agonist trafficking 
(Berg et al., 1998; Gray and Roth, 2001; Meana, 2013) and nei-
ther have we discussed the role of heterodimers in serotonergic 
and particularly 5-HT2AR functioning (Gonzalez-Maeso, 2011, 
2014; Gonzalez-Maeso and Sealfon, 2012), nor the role of gluta-
matergic mechanisms that follow 5-HT2AR signalling and how 
these are involved in plasticity (Aghajanian and Marek, 1999). It 
should also be acknowledged that much importance has been 
ascribed to psychedelics’ 5-HT2AR agonist properties but many 
of the psychedelic compounds featured also possess considerable 
actions at other 5-HT receptors, including the 5-HT1AR (Nichols, 
2004). Although we acknowledge this limitation, we also wish to 
emphasise that the evidence is compelling that 5-HT2AR ago-
nism is key to psychedelics’ most characteristic effects 
(Halberstadt, 2015), 5-HT1AR agonism attenuates rather than 
augments these effects (Pokorny et al., 2016; Strassman, 1996) 
and more selective 5-HT2AR agonists appear to have the same 
quintessential psychological effects as the less selective psyche-
delics (Halberstadt, 2017).
We acknowledge that what is presented here is a simplified 
and therefore incomplete picture of brain serotonin function. 
This was an intentional approach (and compromise) however, 
as our main aim was not to produce an exhaustive review of 
serotonin transmission at its many receptors but rather distil it 
down to some key principles. We chose to focus on the 5-HT1A 
and 2A receptors because we felt that the functions associated 
with their signalling give the most comprehensive perspective 
of the general functioning of brain serotonin transmission. 
These two receptors are more implicated in the pharmacology 
of major psychiatric disorders than any of the other 5-HT recep-
tor subtypes (Artigas et al., 2013b; Azmitia, 2007) – although 
others have highlighted the 5-HT1B receptor using a similar 
argument (Nautiyal and Hen, 2017) and it must be conceded 
that wealth of data does not necessarily imply strength of rela-
tionship. However, that the 5-HT1A and 2A receptors have 
opposite effects on single cell activity has long been a matter of 
intrigue (Araneda and Andrade, 1991). Crucially, that these 
receptors also seem to subserve distinct functions (Table 1) 
implies that the 5-HT system is not just diverse, but adaptive. 
We propose that the 5-HT system is specifically adaptive to the 
severity of adversity and whether it is better to passively toler-
ate it (with the assistance of 5-HT1AR signalling) or more 
actively respond it via a major change in perspective and/or 
behaviour (with the assistance of 5-HT2AR signalling).
Another criticism of this paper is that it has focused too much 
on 5-HT2AR agonist psychedelics and MDMA, rather than on 
classical preclinical behavioural literature and less potent seroton-
ergic manipulations. In defence of our approach, the primacy we 
have given to research on psychedelics has allowed us to conceive 
a truly novel model of brain serotonin function. The most unique 
component of our model is pathway 2 (Figure 3), i.e. that 5-HT2AR 
signalling mediates plasticity related processes in aid of active cop-
ing. That this pathway has not previously been emphasised in mod-
els of serotonin function may have been due to a historical focus on 
the association between 5-HT2AR agonism and pathology and an 
insufficient willingness to acknowledge and endeavour to study 
these drugs’ complex subjective effects. We share the view of oth-
ers (Grof, 1979; Heifets and Malenka, 2016) that 5-HT2AR ago-
nist psychedelics and MDMA are remarkably powerful tools for 
studying the human brain and mind – and their scientific and 
medicinal value has not yet been properly appreciated (Carhart-
Harris and Goodwin, 2017). We also believe that human studies 
with these compounds can be done safely if appropriate safeguards 
are heeded (Johnson et al., 2008).
It could be argued that too much emphasis has been placed on 
extreme states in this paper that are not relevant to normal physio-
logical conditions. Basal 5-HT2AR signalling has shown to be 
important for the maintenance of normal levels of cognitive flexi-
bility (Boulougouris et al., 2008; Clarke et al., 2004, 2007) and may 
also account for traits such as high ‘absorption’ (Ott et al., 2005). 
We subscribe to the principle that challenging a system with an 
extreme perturbation can yield especially valuable insights about its 
normal functioning, by pushing it to and beyond its limits. 
Moreover, given that evolutionary pressures are major drivers of 
adaptation and change, understanding how a particular function 
operates during extreme conditions (e.g. when one’s life is in dan-
ger), may be particularly informative about why that function exists 
at all. It seems reasonable to infer that states induced by MDMA 
and 5-HT2AR agonist psychedelics may be possible to achieve 
without these drugs, if only at an attenuated level. These drugs may 
therefore justifiably be considered ‘unveilers of function’. Note: the 
term ‘psychedelic’ literally means ‘mind-revealing’.
Relatedly, it is intriguing to speculate that 5-HT2AR signalling 
may have played an important role in human evolutionary as well 
as ontogenetic development, perhaps through enhancing plasticity 
and adaptability during extreme conditions. The 5-HT2AR is dens-
est in evolutionary recent brain regions (Beliveau et al., 2016; 
Erritzoe et al., 2009; Ettrup et al., 2014, 2016; Varnas et al., 2004; 
). Indeed, it is readily apparent in Figure 1 that 5-HT2AR expres-
sion is especially dense in regions of the so-called default-mode 
network, which is associated with especially high-level psycho-
logical functions, such as self-consciousness and the ‘self’ or ‘ego’ 
itself (Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2010) as well as the acute net-
work level effects of psychedelics, as determined by human neuro-
imaging studies (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014). By body weight, 
humans have vastly more cortex than other species (MacLean, 
1990; Molnar et al., 2014) (where 5-HT2ARs are densest (Ettrup 
et al., 2014)) and our remarkable adaptability is one of our most 
defining species traits (Anton et al., 2014) – as is our sense of self. 
It has been hypothesised by a popular proponent of psychedelic 
drug-use (Terrence McKenna) that ingestion of naturally occurring 
psychedelics (e.g. psilocybe mushrooms) catalysed the evolution 
of the human neocortex (Abraham et al., 1998). A perhaps more 
plausible (and less psychedelic-centric) alternative however, is that 
 Carhart-Harris and Nutt 
1107
non-linearities evolved in the serotonergic system (Erritzoe et al., 
2010; Jansson et al., 2001) that conferred optimal adaptability, 
including a capacity to switch to greater 5-HT2AR signalling when 
conditions demand it (such as during extreme adversity). Future 
work may endeavour to test the hypothesis that 5-HT2AR signal-
ling serves an exceptional function in humans. The vastness of our 
5-HT2AR dense cortex suggests that this hypothesis is worth 
exploring, and the development of agonist radioligands that can 
label the 5-HT2AR in its high affinity state may help us in this 
regard (Ettrup et al., 2014, 2016; Jorgensen et al., 2016).
Regarding neuroimaging the psychedelic state, this is a nascent 
and fast-moving field and it would be beyond the scope of this 
article to discuss the relevant published findings in detail (this area 
is deserving of its own review paper). Suffice to say that an emer-
gent principle from the various studies is that the brain is uncharac-
teristically ‘entropic’ in the psychedelic state (Carhart-Harris et al., 
2014), reflecting a greatly heightened plasticity in which old mate-
rial may be unlearned (consistent with the principles of extinction 
learning) and new ideas and associations learned.
It might be argued (unfairly in our view) that the present con-
tribution on the function of brain serotonin has not added any-
thing new to previous models (Andrews et al., 2015; Azmitia, 
2007; Branchi, 2011; Dayan and Huys, 2009; Deakin, 1998). We 
acknowledge that the model presented here has been much 
inspired by previous attempts to resolve this enigma but feel it 
also significantly advances on them and is entirely novel in its 
own right. It integrates findings that were inspirational for previ-
ous models but also assimilates recent and (perhaps somewhat 
overlooked) data on the brain and behavioural effects of potent 
serotonergic drugs such as MDMA and the 5-HT2AR agonist 
psychedelics. Previous models acknowledged the role of hip-
pocampal 5-HT1AR signalling in resilience (Deakin, 2013; 
Deakin and Graeff, 1991) but we have significantly extended on 
this by our thorough coverage of 5-HT2AR functioning and its 
mediation of plasticity in aid of optimal adaptability.
Regarding specific past contributions, we acknowledge the 
work of Deakin and Graeff (Deakin, 2013; Deakin and Graeff, 
1991) and others (Cools et al., 2008; Crockett et al., 2009; Wise 
et al., 1970) concerning the role of 5-HT in aversive processing, 
plus the increasingly compelling work on serotonin’s role in pro-
moting patience (Fonseca et al., 2015; Miyazaki et al., 2012, 2014) 
and collectively relate these to our hypothesis that postsynaptic 
5-HT1AR signalling mediates passive coping in response to adver-
sity. It is worth commenting on a nuance here: in Deakin and 
Graeff’s model, 5-HT1AR signalling is linked to chronic adversity 
– which we do not dispute; however, we would argue that 
5-HT2AR signalling becomes increasingly relevant as the severity 
of adversity reaches a critical point. Indeed, we have emphasised 
the importance of the severity of adversity in our model – but it 
may be worthwhile to also consider the role of the chronicity of 
adversity in determining the differential engagement of 5-HT 
receptor subtypes (Cohen et al., 2015; Dayan and Huys, 2009).
We also acknowledge the increasingly appealing perspectives 
of Branchi (2011), Belsky et al. (2009) and others (Homberg, 
2012) concerning serotonin and plasticity, and relate this to our 
hypothesis that 5-HT2AR signalling mediates plasticity in aid of 
optimal adaptability. We acknowledge Andrew et al.’s hypothesis 
of serotonin mediating an adaptive homeostasis (Andrews et al., 
2015) (see also Hale et al. (2013)) and believe this could be 
broadly related to our bipartite model. However, we feel our 
model is more psychologically focused, receptor specific, and 
consistent with the classical view that enhanced 5-HT transmis-
sion (within certain bounds and contexts) is conducive to positive 
mood. Perspectives such as Andrews and colleagues (2015) that 
challenge this view, cite, among other things, the relationship 
between punishment, 5-HT release and depression – to endorse 
the perspective that serotonergic functioning is elevated in 
depression (Barton et al., 2008)). Consistent with the classical 
(Wise et al., 1970) and arguably still dominant perspective 
(Cowen and Browning, 2015) however, our view is that increased 
5-HT release in response to adversity is functional rather than 
pathological, serving to moderate stress via postsynaptic 
5-HT1AR signalling, and in extreme cases, initiate a rapid plas-
ticity in the service of major change – via 5-HT2AR signalling.
Conclusions: the function of brain 
serotonin
This paper has sought to address a major unresolved problem in 
neuropsychopharmacology, namely what is the function of brain 
serotonin? It proposes that the principal function of brain seroto-
nin is to enhance adaptive responses to adverse conditions via 
two distinct pathways: (1) a passive coping pathway which 
improves stress tolerability; and (2) an active coping pathway 
associated with heightened plasticity, which, with support, can 
improve an organism’s ability to identify and overcome source(s) 
of stress by changing outlook and/or behaviour. Crucially, we 
propose that these two functions are mediated by signalling at 
postsynaptic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors respectively, with 
5-HT1AR signalling dominating under ordinary conditions but 
5-HT2AR signalling becoming increasingly operative as the 
level of adversity reaches a critical point.
We suggest that the two functions of interest (5-HT1AR-
mediated stress relief and 5-HT2AR-mediated plasticity) are suf-
ficiently distinct – and may even be mutually oppositional in 
certain contexts (see also Azmitia, 2001), evoking dilemmas over 
whether it is better to passively endure or actively approach, and 
in so doing, initiate some sort of fundamental change – with the 
potential for major resolution. This rule may not be absolute 
however, and the two functions may also be complementary, e.g. 
in the case of enhanced serotonin functioning with chronic SSRI 
use – or indeed with normal basal 5-HT functioning, facilitating 
improved endurance and plasticity (Clarke et al., 2004, 2007; 
Mithoefer et al., 2011, 2016; van Apeldoorn et al., 2008).
Despite this complementarity, we do anticipate that conven-
tional serotonergic antidepressants such as the SSRIs and classic 
psychedelics such as psilocybin may become competitive options 
for the treatments of certain disorders such as depression; most fun-
damentally because they work via distinct pathways (i.e. 5-HT1AR 
versus the 5-HT2AR signalling) – but also because they cannot eas-
ily be taken in combination, i.e. conventional antidepressants atten-
uate the characteristic psychological effects of psychedelics 
(Bonson et al., 1996; Bonson and Murphy, 1996). SSRIs are estab-
lished evidence-based treatments for anxiety and major depression 
(Baldwin et al., 2016; Hieronymus et al., 2016), whereas psyche-
delics are experimental medicines in an early phase of development 
(Carhart-Harris and Goodwin, 2017; Carhart-Harris et al., 2016). 
However, if evidence supporting the therapeutic value of psyche-
delics accrues – as we anticipate, and it is increasingly shown that 
 1108

their therapeutic mechanisms are significantly distinct from those 
of conventional medications, then this will open-up new and poten-
tially empowering options for patients and clinicians (as well as a 
real potential for resistance – however it may arise). For the brave 
new psychiatry of the future – that many would like to see (Miller, 
2010) – decisions about whether to passively endure or actively 
address, may become increasingly pertinent.
