ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVES This study aims to conduct a meta-analysis comparing efficacy and safety outcomes between
subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD) and transvenous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
(TV-ICD).
BACKGROUND The S-ICD was developed to minimize complications related to the conventional TV-ICD. Direct
comparison of clinical outcomes between the 2 devices has been limited by varying patient characteristics and definitions
of complications with no randomized trials completed comparing these systems.
METHODS Studies in the PubMed and Embase databases and secondary referencing sources were systematically
reviewed. Studies meeting criteria were included in the meta-analysis. Baseline characteristics and outcome data of the
S-ICD and TV-ICD groups were appraised and analyzed. A random-effects model was used to derive odds ratio (OR)
with 95% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS Five studies met inclusion criteria. Baseline characteristics were similar between the S-ICD and TV-ICD
groups. Fewer lead complications occurred in the S-ICD group compared to the TV-ICD group (OR: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.05 to
0.38). The infection rate was similar between the S-ICD and TV-ICD groups (OR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.30 to 1.89). There
were no differences in system or device failures between groups (OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.43 to 3.02). Overall, inappropriate
therapy (T-wave oversensing, supraventricular tachycardia, episodes of inappropriate sensing) was similar between
the 2 groups (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.51 to 1.49). However, the nature of inappropriate therapy was different between the
S-ICD and TV-ICD groups. Both devices appear to perform equally well with respect to appropriate shocks.
CONCLUSIONS S-ICD reduced lead-related complications but was similar to TV-ICD with regard to non–lead-related
complications, including inappropriate therapy. These results support the concept that S-ICD is a safe and effective
alternative to TV-ICD in appropriate patients. (J Am Coll Cardiol EP 2017;-:-–-) © 2017 The Authors. Published

 T
he
implantable
cardioverter-
defibrillator (ICD) is effective treat-
ment of both primary and secondary
prevention of sudden cardiac death (1–3).
Despite this lifesaving therapy, ICD use is
associated with both short- and long-term
complications
leading
to
considerable
morbidity and mortality (4). Transvenous
(TV) leads are vulnerable to complications
such as lead fractures, which in turn lead
to
inappropriate
therapy
and
infections.
Device-related infection rates vary between
0.67% and 1.49% over a 3- to 12-month
follow-up period (5–7). Mechanical lead fail-
ures arising from hardware malfunction can result
in oversensing, inappropriate shocks, and inability
to deliver appropriate therapy. Long-term lead failure
rates up to 20% have been reported (8).
The
subcutaneous
implantable
cardioverter-
defibrillator (S-ICD) is a novel technology that has
been
designed
to
limit
complications
associated
with
the
transvenous
implantable
cardioverter-
defibrillator (TV-ICD). Traditionally, S-ICD has been
used in patients with difficult venous access. Thus,
congenital
heart
disease
patients
with
venous
anomalies (either inherited or acquired) are good
candidates
for
S-ICD,
especially
those
who
are
expected to outlive the life expectancy of their TV
leads, thus requiring device extractions later in life.
Moreover, S-ICD may be considered in patients with
channelopathies or those undergoing renal replace-
ment therapies requiring chronic venous access.
The S-ICD, however, has its own limitations. In
contrast to the TV-ICD, S-ICD lacks pacing capacity and
therefore
cannot
provide
antitachycardia
pacing.
Antitachycardia
pacing
has
been
an
important
component of tachyarrhythmia therapy for SCD by
terminating dangerous arrhythmias before their esca-
lation. Despite the perception that S-ICD is similarly
useful as the TV-ICD in many clinical scenarios, there
remains a considerable disparity in S-ICD usage, due to
lack of experience with the new device and absence of
comparative
literature.
Moreover,
the
S-ICD
was
approved for use based on prospective trials in the
absence
of
control
groups
(9).
Accordingly,
no
randomized trials have compared the S-ICD with TV-
ICD. However, a few case-control and retrospective
studies have directly compared the efficacy and com-
plications in recipients of these 2 devices. To overcome
this paucity in the current literature, we conducted the
first meta-analysis to summarize and compare clinical
outcomes between S-ICD and TV-ICD, including lead-
related and unrelated complications, inappropriate
therapies, and appropriate shocks.
METHODS
SEARCH
STRATEGY. A systemic review was con-
ducted of the PubMed and Embase databases from
the year 2000 to present by searching for the key
words
“subcutaneous
ICD,”
“transvenous
ICD,”
“conventional ICD,” “dual-chamber ICD,” or “single
chamber ICD.” To identify additional studies, we also
searched references of relevant research.
STUDY SELECTION. Studies were eligible for review
based on the following criteria: 1) studies that directly
compared
clinical
outcomes
between
S-ICD
and
TV-ICD in adult patients; and 2) articles that contained
data on ICD lead complications, nonlead complica-
tions such as infection rate, hematoma, pneumo-
thorax,
system
or
device
failure,
inappropriate
therapy, and episodes of appropriate therapy. All case
reports or case series were excluded after title and
abstract reviews. By this process, 6 studies were
identified for full text reviews (10–15). The study by
Pettit et al. (15) was excluded after further review
because it included a teenage population. In the end, 5
studies were included in the meta-analysis (Figure 1).
DATA
EXTRACTION. Two
reviewers
(J.L.,
X.J.)
independently
performed
literature
review,
data
extraction, and data entry. Any discrepancy was
resolved
by
a
third
reviewer
(I.B.R.).
The
data
that were extracted included title of the study;
authors; publication year; sample size (number of
patients in the S-ICD and TV-ICD groups); patients’
baseline
demographic
data
such
as
age,
gender,
and ejection fraction; proportion of patients with
coronary artery disease, nonischemic heart disease,
hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy,
or
heart
failure
(ischemic, nonischemic, and mixed); indication for
ICD (primary vs. secondary prevention); and outcome
data such as lead-related complications, non–lead-
related complications (infection, hematoma, pneu-
mothorax,
system/device
failure),
episodes
of
inappropriate therapies, and appropriate shocks.
The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to appraise
the quality of the case-control studies. All studies
have a score of 5 or above. Total score of each study is
given in Table 1.
DATA
ANALYSIS
AND
SYNTHESIS. The
meta-
analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.3 software
(Cochrane Collaboration, London, United Kingdom).
Age and ejection fraction of the baseline patient
characteristics were analyzed and reported as mean
with 95% confidence interval (CI). A random-effects
model was used to derive odds ratio (OR) with
95% CI on dichotomous outcome data.

of lead complications, infection, device failures, and
inappropriate therapies are shown in Online Figure 1.
However, when fewer than 10 studies were included
in the meta-analysis, the power of the test may have
been too low to detect true asymmetry from chance,
so no definitive information can be drawn.
RESULTS
Of
the
6
studies
that
included
both
S-ICD
and
TV-ICDs, 5 case-control and retrospective studies
meeting the inclusion criteria were selected for the
meta-analysis. The baseline characteristics of the
cohorts are summarized in Table 2. The populations
were similar with regard to age, gender, indications
for ICD (primary vs. secondary prevention), and pro-
portion of patients with ischemic heart disease, car-
diomyopathy (ischemic, nonischemic, and dilated), or
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Table 2).
Comparison
of
clinical
outcomes
between
the
S-ICD and TV-ICD groups is summarized in Table 3.
Lead complications were significantly less in the
S-ICD group compared to the TV-ICD group (OR: 0.13;
95% CI: 0.05 to 0.38) (Figure 2A). Nonlead complica-
tions were also analyzed. The total infection rate was
0.35% (8 of 2,269) among S-ICD recipients, and the
infection rate was similar between the S-ICD and
TV-ICD groups (OR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.30 to 1.89)
(Figure 2B). System or device failure was not signifi-
cantly
different
between
the
S-ICD
and
TV-ICD
groups (OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.43 to 3.02) (Figure 2C).
Prevalence of inappropriate therapy [T-wave over-
sensing, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), episodes
of inappropriate sensing] was similar between the
2 groups (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.51 to 1.49) (Figure 2D).
However, the nature of inappropriate therapy was
different between the S-ICD and TV-ICD groups.
Inappropriate therapies in the TV-ICD group were
primarily due to SVT (Figure 2E), whereas inappro-
priate shocks in the S-ICD group were mostly episodes

 of oversensing (sensing of noise and T-wave over-
sensing, among others) (Figure 2F).
Only 2 studies in this meta-analysis reported data
on appropriate shocks delivered by S-ICD versus
TV-ICD. Köbe et al. (14) reported 3 of 69 patients in
the S-ICD group experienced appropriate shocks,
whereas 2 of 69 patients in the TV-ICD group expe-
rienced appropriate shocks. Brower et al. (11) reported
an appropriate shock rate of 17% (95% CI: 6.3% to
26.4%) among S-ICD recipients and 21.3% (95% CI:
12.6% to 27.3%) among TV-ICD recipients. This dif-
ference, after adjusting for ICD programming, was
found to be insignificant by Brouwer et al. (11).
DISCUSSION
The initial evaluation of an entirely subcutaneous ICD
system was described by Bardy et al. (16) in 2010. The
investigators conducted 2 small, single-group trials of
permanent device implantation and found that the
S-ICD successfully and consistently detected and
converted ventricular fibrillation, as well as success-
fully detected and treated 12 episodes of SVT. How-
ever, the preliminary data from the study were not
adequate to show the relative benefit of the S-ICD
compared to the TV-ICD. The study also was not able to
draw conclusions about whether S-ICD was superior to
TV-ICD with respect to lead stability or failure (16).
Since the study by Bardy et al. (16), 2 large pro-
spective studies [IDE (S-ICD system IDE Clinical
Investigation) and EFFORTLESS (Boston Scientific
Post Market-S-ICD Registry)] have been conducted to
evaluate the safety and efficacy of the S-ICD in large
diverse populations. In a pooled analysis of the 2-year
results of these 2 studies, Burke et al. (17) provided
further support for the safety and efficacy of the
S-ICD in patients with primary and secondary in-
dications, showing that the device has very high
shock efficacy for spontaneous SVT and a decreasing
incidence for inappropriate shocks.
We present the first meta-analysis of case-control
and
retrospective
studies

outcomes and complication rates between S-ICD and

 TV-ICD recipients. Our main findings are that S-ICD
reduced lead-related complications but was similar to
TV-ICD with regard to non–lead-related complica-
tions. Prevalence of inappropriate therapy was not
statistically different between the 2 groups. In addi-
tion, the 2 devices appear to perform equally well
with respect to appropriate shocks based on the 2
studies that reported such data.
As noted previously, no published randomized
trials have compared S-ICD and TV-ICD. However, the
PRAETORIAN (Prospective, RAndomizEd comparison
of
subcuTaneOus
and
tRansvenous
ImplANtable
cardioverter-defibrillator therapy) trial is a random-
ized, controlled, multicenter study comparing the
advantages and disadvantages of S-ICD. The study
includes a total of 700 patients randomized to either
S-ICD or TV-ICD (1:1), and the study is powered to
assess
the
noninferiority
of
S-ICD
compared
to
TV-ICD
with
respect
to
the
composite
primary
endpoint of ICD-related complications and inappro-
priate therapy. This trial, the first of its kind, will help
to shed additional light on how the 2 devices compare
with regard to clinical outcome endpoints when
results become available in 2019 (18).
INFECTION. Infective complications were defined as
device-related infections that necessitated removal of
the ICD system and/or antibiotic treatment, including
endocarditis and pocket infection. Two of the 5
studies (Friedman et al. [12] and Brouwer et al. [11])
did not distinguish between infections treated with
antibiotics alone and those requiring surgical extrac-
tion.
In
the
remaining
3
studies,
all
infections
required surgical lead extraction. In the study by

 Mithani et al. (13), no patient in the S-ICD group had
an infection requiring lead extraction, whereas 2.8%
of patients (2 of 71) in the TV-ICD group required lead
extraction. In the study by Köbe et al. (14), 1 patient
each from the S-ICD and TV-ICD groups suffered
infection requiring lead extraction (total of 69 pa-
tients in each group). Honarbakhsh et al. (10) found 1
of 69 patients in the S-ICD group required lead
extraction versus 4 of 69 patients in the TV-ICD
group.
Complications
related
to
lead
extractions
were not analyzed in the studies.
The
total
infection
rate
among
S-ICD
recipients
was 0.35% in our meta-analysis, which is lower than
the infection rate of 3.9% (95% CI: 2.2% to 5.7%) among
S-ICD recipients reported in a study analyzing early
results of the EFFORTLESS S-ICD registry in 2013
(19). The EFFORTLESS S-ICD registry was an interna-
tional, nonrandomized, standard-of-care, multicenter
registry designed to collect long-term, system-related,
clinical, and patient-reported outcome data from S-ICD
implanted patients since June 2009. The higher rates
of infection in the registry may be related to procedural
inexperience with appropriate skin and other pre-
operative preparations, as well as unfamiliarity with
the surgical approach of left lateral thoracotomy and
tunneling
of
the
lead.
Further
support
for
this
hypothesis was noted in the S-ICD IDE study, in
which most of the infections occurred during the
early aspects of the trial (9). The longer observation time
in the EFFORTLESS registry may have also partly
contributed to the higher infection rate. The follow-up
times of the studies included in this meta-analysis
varied, but most were <3 years. Our meta-analysis did
not demonstrate a significant difference in infections
between the S-ICD and TV-ICD groups (OR: 0.75; 95% CI:
0.30 to 1.89). This may be an unexpected finding,
as S-ICD has been hypothesized to be more beneficial
in patients at higher risk for intravascular infections.
However, 2 of the 5 studies did demonstrate a higher
incidence of infection in the TV-ICD group, although
this failed to reach statistical significance. Therefore, it
is possible that the meta-analysis was inadequate to
detect the true difference in infection complications. A
more plausible explanation for this finding may be that
S-ICD
infections
were
primarily
related
to
device
implantation, which, given the similarity between the
2 procedures, was not expected to be different from
TV-ICD. Regardless, the consequences of S-ICD infection
appear to be less severe, as no intravascular infection
has been noted with S-ICD infection. Once available,
long-term data will help to differentiate the infection
rates related to the presence or absence of leads
specifically. In this regard, the ongoing post-marketing
study would be beneficial.

 LEAD COMPLICATIONS. Our study also showed that
lead complications were reduced in the S-ICD group
compared to the TV-ICD group (OR: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.05
to 0.38). This finding reinforces the concept that TV
leads are truly the “Achilles heel” of the traditional
ICD. The S-ICD group experienced similar system
failures as the TV-ICD group.
INAPPROPRIATE THERAPY. The prevalence of inap-
propriate therapy among S-ICD recipients in our
meta-analysis was 8.3%. This rate was comparable to
that reported in the EFFORTLESS registry, which re-
ported a 360-day inappropriate shock rate of 7%
among S-ICD recipients (18). The majority of inap-
propriate shocks in the EFFORTLESS study were due
to
oversensing
(85%),
most
frequently
T-wave
oversensing. The inappropriate therapy rate among
TV-ICD recipients in our meta-analysis was 9.4%,
comparable to that of other TV-ICD registries and
trials, which reported ranges from 4% to 18% (20–22).
Our study found that S-ICD and TV-ICD had similar
rates of inappropriate therapies, but they differed in
nature. Inappropriate therapies in the TV-ICD group
were
driven
by
aberrant
atrial
rhythms
(SVT),
whereas inappropriate shocks in S-ICD were either
noise
or
T-wave
oversensing.
Our
finding
was
consistent with data reported from existing registries
and single-arm trials on the 2 devices (20–22). The
better performance of S-ICD with SVT may be due to
the software’s reliable morphology discriminator in
its conditional shock zone. The emergence of better
technology may further help to reduce noise over-
sensing and thus the inappropriate therapy currently
experienced with the first-generation S-ICD devices.
For instance, Brisben et al. (23) have devised a new
algorithm that reduces T-wave oversensing episodes
by 40%, which has the potential for a clinically
meaningful decrease in inappropriate shocks.
APPROPRIATE
SHOCKS. Only 2 of the 5 studies
([Köbe et al. [14] and Brouwer et al. [11]) reported data
on appropriate shocks delivered by S-ICD versus
TV-ICD.
Both
studies
reported
similar
rates
of
appropriate therapies between the 2 devices. Based
on review of these limited data, S-ICD appears to
perform equally well as TV-ICD with respect to
delivering appropriate shocks.
MORTALITY. Overall, mortality rate was low and did
not differ between the S-ICD and TV-ICD groups in all
5 studies. Four studies reported mortality at the time
of follow-up, which ranged from 180 days to 5 years; 1
study reported in-hospital mortality only. The long-
term mortality rate across studies ranged from 0%
to 2.8% among ICD recipients. Honarbakhsh et al. (10)
reported no mortality in either group at the time of
follow-up. Köbe et al. (14) reported a mortality rate of
1.4% in each group. In the study by Brouwer et al. (11),
5-year patient survival was 96.0% (95% CI: 90.1% to
100.0%) in the S-ICD arm versus 94.8% (95% CI:
90.7% to 99.0%) in the TV-ICD arm (p ¼ 0.42). Mithani
et al. (13) reported 1.4% (1 of 71) mortality rate in the
S-ICD group and 2.8% (2 of 71) mortality rate in the
TV-ICD group.
STUDY LIMITATIONS. Our meta-analysis has several
limitations. First, meta-analysis is limited by the
small number of studies currently published directly
comparing efficacy and safety outcomes of S-ICD and
TV-ICD. With fewer than 10 studies, we were unable
to test formally for funnel plot asymmetry, as the
power of the test was too low to distinguish chance
from real asymmetry. A second limitation of the study
is the variability of the follow-up regimen of the
different studies. The study by Friedman et al. (12)
evaluated the in-hospital outcomes associated with
adoption of S-ICD and TV-ICD, whereas the mean
follow-up duration for other studies ranged between
180 days and 5 years. This somewhat limits the
comparability of the studies. In addition, candidacy
of S-ICD is screened by electrocardiography (ECG)
designed to identify patients susceptible to T-wave
oversensing. Patients with T-wave inversions in leads
I, II, and aVF on a standard ECG were found to be 23
times more likely to fail than patients without these
ECG abnormalities (24). Recipients of TV-ICD did not
undergo this screening test. Even though the study
population in all 5 studies included in the meta-
analysis were propensity-matched for baseline char-
acteristics and major comorbidities, it is unclear
whether the ECG screening may have eliminated
some of the sicker patients from the S-ICD group, thus
affecting the outcome. Furthermore, TV lead–associ-
ated tricuspid regurgitation and resultant right-sided
congestive heart failure have been postulated as
adverse consequences of TV-ICD. The studies in this
meta-analysis did not compare the potential for
developing
tricuspid
regurgitation
or
congestive
heart failure between TV-ICD and S-ICD recipients.
Finally, the studies included in this meta-analysis did
not examine any gender differences in the outcomes.
Given the limitations, more well-designed, prospec-
tive, randomized controlled trials are needed to
confirm the findings.
CONCLUSIONS
This
meta-analysis
conforms
to
the
widely
perceived view that S-ICD has certain advantages

 over TV-ICD, with fewer lead-related complications.
Contrary to what may be expected, our study did
not demonstrate a significant difference in infection
rate between recipients of the 2 devices. The choice
of device type, the risk of lead-related complica-
tions versus the rate of inappropriate therapy, and
the device-specific limitations of S-ICD, including
the lack of pacing capability, should be taken into
account
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
The
nonlead
complications of S-ICD, such as inappropriate ther-
apy, are expected to improve as the technology
improves.

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE:
Selection of S-ICD versus TV-ICD must take into
consideration the differences in lead-related and
non–lead-related complications, as well as
device-specific limitations between the 2 devices
on a case-by-case basis.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: More research
studies, in particular, prospective, large, randomized
controlled trials, are needed to achieve more
comprehensive comparison of efficacy and safety
outcomes between S-ICD to TV-ICD, as well as to
elucidate any gender differences in the outcomes.
