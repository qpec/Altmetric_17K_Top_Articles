SUMMARY
Zika virus (ZIKV) has become a public health threat due to its global transmission and link to 
severe congenital disorders. The host immune responses to ZIKV infection have not been fully 
elucidated, and effective therapeutics are not currently available. Herein, we demonstrated that 
cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (CH25H) was induced in response to ZIKV infection and that its 
enzymatic product, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), was a critical mediator of host protection 
against ZIKV. Synthetic 25HC addition inhibited ZIKV infection in vitro by blocking viral entry, 
and treatment with 25HC reduced viremia and conferred protection against ZIKV in mice and 
rhesus macaques. 25HC suppressed ZIKV infection and reduced tissue damage in human cortical 
organoids and the embryonic brain of the ZIKV-induced mouse microcephaly model. Our findings 
highlight the protective role of CH25H during ZIKV infection and the potential use of 25HC as a 
natural antiviral agent to combat ZIKV infection and prevent ZIKV-associated outcomes, such as 
microcephaly.
In Brief
Zika virus (ZIKV) presents a major challenge to the global health system. Li et al. find that 25-
hydroxycholesterol (25HC) inhibits ZIKV infection in monkeys and human cortical organoids and 
protects mice from microcephaly. 25HC has potential as a first-line antiviral agent to combat a 
broad array of pathogenic species, including ZIKV.

 INTRODUCTION
Zika virus (ZIKV) is an increasing global health threat due to the rapidly expanding range of 
its mosquito vector, international travel of asymptomatic carriers, and the ability to be 
sexually transmitted (D’Ortenzio et al., 2016; Driggers et al., 2016; Musso and Gubler, 
2016; Rasmussen et al., 2016). ZIKV was initially isolated from an infected sentinel rhesus 
monkey in the Zika forest of Ugandain 1947 (Dick et al., 1952). ZIKV infection only caused 
mild symptoms in past epidemics, such as arthralgia, malaise, rash, and conjunctivitis 
(Musso and Gubler, 2016). Its appearance in Brazil in 2015 was accompanied by unexpected 
outbreaks of congenital malformations such as microcephaly, Guillain-Barré syndrome 
(GBS), and meningoencephalitis (Cao-Lormeau et al., 2016; Carteaux et al., 2016). These 
severe neurological manifestations are now attributed to ZIKV, with intrauterine infection of 
pregnant women occasionally leading to microcephaly, spontaneous abortion, and 
intrauterine growth restriction due to placental insufficiency (Brasil et al., 2016; Miner et al., 
2016). Moreover, ZIKV infection can lead to male infertility in mice through testicular 
damage (Ma et al., 2016). Therefore, ZIKV infection presents a huge challenge to the global 
health system.
ZIKV infects neural progenitor cells (NPCs) generated from human-induced pluripotent 
stem cells (hiPSCs) (Tang et al., 2016), resulting in cell death and inhibition of cell-cycle 
progression. The 3D-cultured organoid model recapitulates brain development at an early 
stage and provides an in vitro system to study the molecular mechanisms by which ZIKV 
infection of pregnant mothers results in neurological disorders in the fetus (Garcez et al., 
2016; Qian et al., 2016). Three research groups, including ours, established the direct link 
between ZIKV infection and microcephaly in mice (Cugola et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016a; 
Miner et al., 2016). ZIKV infection in mouse NPCs results in cell apoptosis, cell-cycle 
arrest, and reduction of NPC differentiation, ultimately leading to cortical thinning and 
microcephaly (Li et al., 2016a).
Unfortunately, there is no approved antiviral drug or vaccine to combat ZIKV. The murine 
model of ZIKV pathogenesis is limited to the type I interferon (IFN) signaling knockout line 
(Ifnar−/−), suggesting the potentially protective role of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) during 
ZIKV infection (Lazear et al., 2016). Further evidence comes from recent studies showing 
that the host controls ZIKV infection through IFN signaling pathways (Bayer et al., 2016), 
which protect cells from viral infection by inducing numerous ISGs (Sadler and Williams, 
2008). Recently, interferon-induced transmembrane 1 and 3 proteins (IFITM1 and IFITM3) 
were demonstrated to inhibit ZIKV infection in early stages of the viral life cycle, and 
IFITM3 can prevent ZIKV-induced cell death (Savidis et al., 2016). However, the role of 
other ISGs in host immunity against ZIKV infection remains largely elusive.
Cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (CH25H) is an ISG that encodes an enzyme that oxidizes 
cholesterol to 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) (Holmes et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012). 25HC is 
a natural oxysterol, which controls sterol biosynthesis by regulation of nuclear receptors and 
sterol-responsive element binding protein (SREBP) activity (Janowski et al., 1999). CH25H 
is also involved in the innate immune response to toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and IFN 
(Bauman et al., 2009; Park and Scott, 2010). It has been shown that 25HC-mediated

 induction of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) in macrophages and the endothelium 
mediates atherosclerotic inflammation through induction of interleukin-8 (IL-8) (Brown and 
Jessup, 1999; Wang et al., 2012). We and others have recently revealed that CH25H and its 
product, 25HC, inhibit infection by a broad range of pathogenic viruses, including vesicular 
stomatitis virus (VSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and Ebola virus (EBOV) 
(Blanc et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013), but the role of CH25H and 25HC during ZIKV 
infection remains unknown.
In the present study, we revealed the protective role of CH25H against ZIKV infection and 
characterized the protective effects of 25HC in combating ZIKV infection in human cells, 
brain organoids, fetal mice, and macaques.
RESULTS
ZIKV Infection Induces CH25H and Triggers CH25H-Dependent Antiviral Activity
We investigated the role of CH25H in anti-ZIKV immunity and evaluated its expression in a 
ZIKV-infected human alveolar epithelial cell line (A549) using RNA sequencing (RNA-
seq). ZIKV infection upregulated (Log2[fold change]>1) multiple well-characterized 
antiviral ISGs such as MX1, ISG15, OASL, CH25H, and other genes named ZIG (ZIKV-
induced genes) (Figure 1A). Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assays were 
performed to validate the RNA-seq results and confirmed that ZIKV infection led to the 
induction of CH25H in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1B). ZIKV infection also 
significantly induced IFNB (Figure S1A), followed by dramatic induction of CH25H (Figure 
S1B), as well as other ISGs, such as IP10, IFITM3, ISG15, MX1, STING, and RIG-I 
(Figures S1C–S1H). Similarly, treating cells with recombinant IFN-β elevated the CH25H 
level in A549 cells (Figure S1I).
To further determine the role of CH25H during ZIKV infection, CH25H knockout A549 
cells were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (Figures S2A and S2B) and were 
subjected to ZIKV infection. Both qRT-PCR and plaque assays (Figures 1C and 1D) 
demonstrated that CH25H deficiency significantly enhanced ZIKV replication in A549 cells 
compared to wild-type (WT) cells. Furthermore, overexpression of CH25H in HeLa cells 
significantly inhibited ZIKV replication, similar to the inhibitory impact of IRF1, which was 
used as a positive control (Figure 1E). However, overexpression of CH25H-M, which carries 
a mutation in the active site of the enzyme (hydroxylase activity-dead mutant) (Chen et al., 
2014), showed no significant effect on ZIKV infection (Figure 1E), suggesting that the 
enzymatic activity of CH25H is essential for its antiviral function. HeLa cells were 
transfected with plasmids expressing CH25H and CH25H-M, and after 24 hr, the 
supernatants were used to treat baby hamster kidney-21 (BHK-21) cells. The supernatants 
from HeLa cells overexpressing CH25H, but not CH25H-M, significantly inhibited ZIKV 
infection in BHK-21 cells (Figure 1F) and HeLa cells (Figure S3A). Furthermore, the 
presence of 25HC in the media from WT CH25H-overexpressing cells was confirmed by 
mass spectrometry (MS) analysis (Figures S3B and S3C).

 Together, these results indicated that CH25H is induced in response to ZIKV infection in 
mammalian cells and may play a protective role against ZIKV infection through its 
enzymatic product, 25HC.
25HC Broadly Inhibits Flavivirus Infection by Blocking Viral Entry
One of the major barriers in antiviral therapy is potential cytotoxicity. Therefore, we 
investigated the cytotoxicity of 25HC using Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells. We 
found that 25HC at concentrations as high as 10 µM showed no obvious cytotoxicity (Figure 
S4A). However, cells were protected from ZIKV at a concentration of 0.4 µM of 25HC, as 
measured by plaque assay (Figures 2A and S4B). These results were also confirmed by qRT-
PCR and immunofluorescence assays (Figures 2B, S4C, and S4D). The IC50 of 25HC 
against ZIKV was calculated to be 188 nM (Figure 2C), which was similar to that of the 
well-characterized pan-flavivirus polymerase inhibitor NITD008 (Deng et al., 2016; Yin et 
al., 2009). We further tested the antiviral efficacy of 25HC against other flavivirus members, 
including Dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and West Nile virus (WNV), 
and found that the IC50s of 25HC were 406, 526, and 1109 nM, respectively (Figures 2D–
2F). These results demonstrated that 25HC is a potent pan-flavivirus inhibitor.
To determine which step of the flavivirus life cycle is inhibited by 25HC, ZIKV genomic 
RNA from the supernatant of the infected cells treated with 25HC were measured by qRT-
PCR. 25HC blocked ZIKV replication in both 25HC, pre- or post-treated cells (Figure S5A). 
However, the inhibitory effect of 25HC observed in post-treated cells was less than the effect 
in pre-treated cells (Figure S5A). Next, a cell-binding assay was conducted in Vero cells. 
The results showed that viral binding to the host was not affected by 25HC treatment (Figure 
S5B), indicating that 25HC does not affect the cell-binding capability of ZIKV. An 
internalization assay was performed in BHK-21 cells as previously described (Talarico et al., 
2005). 25HC blocked ZIKV internalization in a dose-dependent manner, while NITD008, an 
adenosine nucleoside inhibitor that inhibits the RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) 
activity of DENV (Yin et al., 2009), failed to do so (Figure 3A). In addition, a syncytia 
formation assay in C6/36 cells was done to investigate whether 25HC inhibits flavivirus-
mediated cell-to-cell fusion (Zaitseva et al., 2010). Similar to the 4G2 monoclonal antibody
—a flavivirus envelope protein antibody—used as a positive control, 25HC prevented 
DENV2-mediated cell-to-cell fusion in mosquito cells (Figure 3B and Figure S5C). We were 
able to show that the addition of an artificial liposome that can merge with the A549 cell 
membrane was able to compete with 25HC for membrane incorporation and reduced the 
anti-ZIKV function of 25HC in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3C). ZIKV and DENV 
replicon assays showed that 25HC did not inhibit ZIKV or DENV RNA replication (Figure 
3D) when compared to NITD008. 25HC was able to inhibit ZIKV infection in IFNAR1−/− 
A549 cells (Figure S5D), indicating that the inhibitory function of 25HC to ZIKV infection 
was independent of the type I IFN signaling pathway. Therefore, unlike NITD008, 25HC 
inhibited flavivirus infection by blocking its entry at the early stage of infection.
25HC Reduces ZIKV Viremia and Improves Survival in Mice
As our in vitro data indicated that 25HC promoted anti-viral activity against ZIKV, we next 
tested the in vivo antiviral effects of 25HC in 3- to 4-week-old immunocompetent BALB/c

 mice as described previously (Larocca et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016). Animals were 
treated with 25HC (50 mg/kg) or vehicle and infected with ZIKV strain GZ01/2016 
intraperitoneally (i.p.). ZIKV RNA in serum was measured one day post-infection (dpi) by 
qRT-PCR. 25HC treatment significantly reduced viremia in mice compared to the vehicle 
(Figure 4A).
Furthermore, we evaluated the in vivo antiviral activity of 25HC in the IFN-α/β-receptor-
deficient A129 mouse model (Lazear et al., 2016). ZIKV-inoculated A129 mice treated with 
the vehicle died within 14 dpi (Figure 4B) with severe neurological symptoms, including 
hind limb weakness and paralysis. Treatment with 50 mg/kg of 25HC reduced mortality 
significantly (Figure 4B), and the surviving mice developed no clinical symptoms. Viremia 
measured at 4 and 7 dpi was considerably reduced in 25HC-treated mice (Figures 4C and 
4D). The ZIKV titer in the brains of 25HC-treated animals was also reduced at 7 dpi (Figure 
4E). These results suggested that 25HC efficiently protects mice from ZIKV-associated 
morbidity and mortality.
25HC Protects Rhesus Monkeys from ZIKV Infection
We further evaluated the protective effect of 25HC against ZIKV infection in the nonhuman 
primate (NHP) model (Dudley et al., 2016). Five animals were challenged with 103 PFU of 
ZIKV, of which two were treated with 25HC (1.5 mg/kg/day, intravenously [i.v.]) and three 
were used as control. At this dose, robust viremia (duration 2–4 days) and detectable uremia 
were seen in the untreated group (Figures 5A and 5B). In contrast, ZIKV was undetectable 
in both the urine and serum of the 25HC-treated group (Figures 5A and 5B). These results 
suggest that 25HC significantly inhibited ZIKV infection in NHPs.
To further evaluate the therapeutic impact of 25HC in the NHP model (Li et al., 2016b), we 
challenged four rhesus monkeys with a higher dose of 105 PFU ZIKV. Two of the animals 
received 25HC, one prior to ZIKV challenge and one post-ZIKV challenge. At this higher 
dose, the two untreated control NHPs experienced fever (axillary temperature > 38.9°C), 
while body temperature was not significantly increased in animals that received 25HC 
(Figure S6A). ZIKV RNA was readily detected in the serum and urine in both control 
animals. 25HC pretreatment 24 hr before challenge shortened the duration of viremia and 
viral shedding in the urine (Figures S6B and S6C). 25HC treatment 4 hr post-challenge also 
shortened ZIKV RNA shedding in the urine (Figure S6C). Together, these results suggested 
that 25HC can attenuate ZIKV infection and prevent fever in monkeys.
Viral infection triggers strong innate immune responses, including the release of 
inflammatory cytokines that, when overexpressed (Iwasaki and Pillai, 2014; Osuna et al., 
2016), can be harmful to the host (Bayless et al., 2016). ZIKV (105 PFU) infection induced 
the expression of IFN-γ, IL-15, and CXCL9 cytokines, and Luminex assay results showed 
that 25HC treatment reduced their production in NHP serum (Figure 5C). Our results 
indicated that 25HC treatment reduces ZIKV infection and its induced symptoms in NHPs.
25HC Inhibits ZIKV Infection in Human Cortical Organoids
To investigate whether 25HC can protect against ZIKV-associated neurological damage, we 
tested its effects in the human cortical organoids (HCO) differentiated from embryonic stem

 cells. HCOs grown in three-dimensional culture (3D culture) were infected with ZIKV strain 
PRVABC59/2015 after 23 days of development in vitro. ZIKV replicated efficiently in the 
HCOs as measured by qRT-PCR (Figure 6A). ZIKV infection also triggered induction of 
IFNB (Figure 6B) and CH25H (Figure 6C) 12, 48, and 72 hr post-infection. Pretreatment 
with as little as 0.5 µM of 25HC significantly suppressed ZIKV infection in the organoids, 
and 2.5 µM treatment resulted in 90% reduction of ZIKV genomic RNA (Figure 6D). 
Pretreatment overnight with 25HC at a concentration of 2.5 µM significantly protected 
HCOs from ZIKV infection as measured by plaque assay (Figure 6E). These results were 
also confirmed by immunofluorescence assay, where the 2.5 µM 25HC treatment almost 
completely protected brain organoids from ZIKV infection (Figure 6F). These results 
together demonstrated that 25HC can effectively protect developing human cortical tissue 
from ZIKV infection.
25HC Inhibits ZIKV Infection in the Embryonic Mouse Brain and Protects against ZIKV-
Induced Microcephaly
It has been reported that ZIKV efficiently replicates in the brains of fetal mice and causes 
microcephaly (Li et al., 2016a). We have shown here that 25HC protects mice from ZIKV-
induced viremia and death and infection of human cortical tissue in vitro. Therefore, we 
investigated whether 25HC could protect the embryonic mouse brain from ZIKV infection 
and resultant microcephaly.
We infected or mock-infected littermate brains at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) and inspected 
them at E18.5. Pregnant mice were treated daily with 25HC or vehicle (HβCD). The number 
of infected cells in the cerebral cortex was significantly reduced in 25HC-treated animals 
compared to the vehicle-treated group (Figure 7A). ZIKV RNA levels in brain tissues were 
also dramatically decreased by 25HC (Figure 7B). We further investigated whether 25HC 
treatment of pregnant mice could prevent ZIKV-associated fetal microcephaly. ZIKV 
infection led to a significant reduction in brain size, enlarged lateral ventricles, and a thinner 
marginal zone (MZ), cortical plate (CP), and ventricular zone/subventricular zone (VZ/SVZ) 
(Figures 7C and 7D). The incidence of these developmental defects was significantly 
reduced upon 25HC treatment of ZIKV-infected pregnant mice (Figures 7C and 7D). It was 
notable that the sub-plate was lost in the ZIKV-infected cortex, yet detectable in 25HC-
treated mice (Figures 7D and 7E). We also stained the cortex at E18.5 with different 
neuronal markers, including Tbr1 and NeuN. We found that ZIKV infection led to a thinner 
cortex and decreased the density of NeuN+ neurons, particularly in the outer layers, and 
these phenotypes could be partially rescued by 25HC treatment (Figure 7E).
Cell-cycle deregulation of neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) and cell death are critical factors 
in microcephaly development (Li et al., 2016a). Therefore, we investigated the effects of 
25HC on cell proliferation and cell death in ZIKV-infected fetal mouse brains. As shown in 
Figure 7F, ZIKV infection considerably reduced the population of phosph-H3 positive cells 
(P-H3, a marker for NPC in the M phase), and 25HC treatment rescued this phenotype. In 
addition, ZIKV infection of the fetal brains led to massive cell death, as shown by the 
number of cells positive for the activated form of caspase 3, which was significantly reduced 
by 25HC treatment (Figure 7G).

 Our studies demonstrated no cytotoxic effects from administering up to 10 µM of 25HC to 
Vero cells in vitro (Figure S4A). Pregnant mice pretreated with 50 mg/kg of 25HC from 
E14.5 for five days showed no significant weight changes or adverse effects on their 
pregnancy (Figure S7A). The birth and condition (growth and weight) of neonatal mice were 
also not affected by 25HC (Figures S7A and S7B). A129 mice injected i.p. with 25HC for 
seven days showed no changes in ALT levels (Figure S7C). Furthermore, the bioavailability 
of 25HC in the serum of BALB/c mice pretreated with 25HC by i.p. route was tested. The 
serum concentration of 25HC peaked at 1 µM at approximately 4 hr post-injection and 
returned to normal levels 24 hr post-injection (Figure S7D).
The above results demonstrated that 25HC treatment of pregnant mice not only prevents 
ZIKV infection in the fetal brain, but also significantly reduces the incidence of 
microcephaly.
DISCUSSION
A major goal of antiviral drug development is to discover drugs that are not only effective 
against known targets, but also have potential applications against unforeseen outbreaks of 
new emerging infections, such as ZIKV. The innate immune system uses effector molecules 
that are naturally very broadly acting; therefore, one promising antiviral strategy is to find 
ways to stimulate those molecules.
Type I IFNs and their downstream ISGs combat a large variety of pathogens and play a 
critical role in host defense against ZIKV, as Ifnar−/− mice do not survive infection (Lazear 
et al., 2016). However, the contributions of individual ISGs in protecting the host from 
ZIKV remain unclear. Our current study shows that a specific ISG, CH25H, is induced in 
host cells and human brain organoids during ZIKV infection. We have also demonstrated 
that CH25H plays a critical role in host defense against ZIKV, as overexpression of CH25H 
strongly suppresses the infection in multiple cell types, and CH25H−/− A549 cells are more 
susceptible to ZIKV infection. Previous studies, including ours, have indicated that CH25H 
conducts its antiviral activities through the production of small antiviral molecule 25HC, 
which is dependent on its hydroxylation activity (Blanc et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013). 
However, we have also shown that CH25H inhibits hepatitis C virus through direct 
interaction with NS5A, which is a hydroxylase-independent mechanism (Chen et al., 2014).
We have compared the antiviral activities of WT and mutated CH25H and demonstrated that 
the mutation abolishing the hydroxylase activity also diminished the antiviral activity against 
ZIKV, suggesting the essential role of the CH25H enzymatic activity in ZIKV inhibition. 
Using the well-established viral internalization assay, DENV-mediated cell-to-cell fusion 
model, and liposome-binding assay, we provided further evidence that 25HC did not affect 
ZIKV-host cell binding, but rather inhibited viral entry. These results are consistent with our 
previous observations that 25HC inhibits viral entry by suppressing fusion between viral and 
cell membranes in VSV, HIV, and Nipah virus infections (Liu et al., 2013). Our results 
showed that 25HC could inhibit ZIKV infection in type I IFN signaling deficient A549 cells 
and in Ifnar−/− mice. However, 25HC may suppress ZIKV infection through other immune 
pathways, like activating integrated stress response (ISR) genes (Shibata et al., 2013) or the

 TLR4-dependent NF-kB pathway as described (Aye et al., 2012), which needs to be further 
investigated.
Recently, Zmurko et al. (2016) have found that 7-deaza-2′-Cmethyla-denosine (7DMA), a 
nucleotide analog known to suppress DENV infection by blocking viral RNA synthesis, 
inhibited ZIKV replication in vitro and in the AG129 mouse model. However, its activity 
was not potent enough to resolve ZIKV infection, and it had cytotoxic effects. Xu et al. 
(2016) screened ~6,000 molecules, including drugs that were approved or under 
investigational use, to discover which of them could inhibit ZIKV replication in neural cells. 
They found that several compounds, including emricasan, niclosamide, and inhibitors of 
cyclin-dependent kinases, could inhibit ZIKV replication or disrupt infection-induced 
caspase-3 activity. Although the impact of these molecules on ZIKV infection in vivo has 
not been investigated, Barrows et al. found that more than 20 out of ~700 FDA-approved 
drugs screened had inhibitory effects on ZIKV infection in vitro (Barrows et al., 2016; Xu et 
al., 2016), yet their in vivo effects also remain to be inspected. Our previous results showed 
that naturally produced 25HC has the potential to be a broad antiviral agent by 
demonstrating its ability to not only suppress HIV and MHV68 infection in vitro and in 
vivo, but also inhibit other highly pathogenic viruses such as EBOV, RVFV, and Nipah virus 
in vitro (Liu et al., 2013).
In this study, we have taken comprehensive approaches, in multiple in vitro and in vivo 
models, to illustrate the efficacy of 25HC against ZIKV infection and its associated 
microcephaly. We showed that 25HC inhibits infection by ZIKV and other flaviviruses, 
including DENV, YFV, and WNV. Treatment with 25HC pre- or post-ZIKV infection 
significantly reduces the morbidity and mortality in mice and considerably reduces fever and 
viremia in monkeys. We have identified a compound that protects against ZIKV-related 
congenital microcephaly in mice. 25HC is an endogenous oxysterol, which can penetrate the 
cell membrane and the blood-brain barrier (Woollett, 2001). This is consistent with our 
results showing that i.p. administration of 25HC in pregnant mice rescues ZIKV-related 
microcephaly. 25HC is a natural anti-viral molecule produced by the host during cholesterol 
metabolism. Moreover, it was found that oxysterols like 24HC, 25HC, and 27HC inhibited 
HIV replication in vitro (Moog et al., 1998). It will be intriguing to investigate the effects of 
other oxysterols against ZIKV infection in the future. However, it has previously been 
reported that 25HC could have toxic effects on placental trophoblasts in vitro at a high dose 
(30 µM) (Larkin et al., 2014). This finding should be investigated more carefully in the 
future before using 25HC in pregnant women.
In conclusion, our study presents a ZIKV inhibitor that not only reduces viremia in mice and 
monkeys, but also protects infected fetal mice from microcephaly. Since 25HC is a natural 
product of lipid metabolism and can modify host membranes to block viral entry, it has great 
potential as a first-line antiviral agent to combat a broad array of viruses, including emerging 
and pathogenic species such as ZIKV.

 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mice, Monkey, and Ethics Statements
129/Sv/Ev mice deficient in IFN-α/β receptors (A129 mice) were kindly provided by Qi-Bin 
Leng (Institut Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences). BALB/c mice were 
purchased from Jackson Laboratory. All mice were bred in our animal facility. Rhesus 
monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Center, Academy 
of Military Medical Science. All experimental procedures involving animals were performed 
according to protocols approved by the Animal Experiment Committee of Laboratory 
Animal Center, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (IACUC-13-2016-001).
Virus, Cells, and Reagents
ZIKV strains (GZ01/2016, GenBank: KU820898; SZ01/2016, GenBank: KU866423; and 
FSS13025/2010, GenBank: JN860885), DENV2-43, YFV-17D, and WNV-chin01 used in 
this study. A549, BHK-21, HeLa, and Vero cells were purchased from ATCC and cultured in 
DMEM media (37°C, 5% CO2). C6/36 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium (28°C, 
5% CO2). All media were supplemented with 10% FBS (ExCell Bio, Jiangsu), 100 units/mL 
penicillin, and 50 µg/mL streptomycin. The hybridoma D1-4G2-4-15 (ATCC: HB-112) was 
used to produce antibody 4G2. Plasmids expressing GFP, IRF1, and CH25H were from 
GeneCopoeia and described in our previous study (Liu et al., 2013). CH25H hydroxylase 
activity-dead mutant (CH25H-M) was mutated from a WT CH25H construct as described 
previously (Chen et al., 2014). 25-Hydroxycholesterol (25HC) and (2-Hydroxypropyl)-β-
cyclodextrin (HβCD) were purchased from Sigma. NITD008 was a kind gift from Pei-Yong 
Shi (Novartis Institute for Infectious Diseases).
Plaque Assay
BHK-21 cells were seeded in a 12-well plate for 12 hr. Cells were washed with 1 × PBS 
once and infected with the viruses used in this study for 1 hr. Viral inoculations were 
aspirated and replaced with DMEM containing 1% low-melting agarose and 2% FBS. Viral 
plaques were developed at 4 dpi.
ZIKV Internalization Assay
BHK-21 cells in 12-well plate were pretreated with 25HC for 12 hr followed by infection 
with ZIKV (200 PFU) at 4°C for 1 hr. After 1 hr, cells were washed with cold 1 × PBS three 
times to remove the un-bound viruses, followed by incubating cells at 37°C for 1 hr to allow 
for virus internalization. Cells were washed once by 1 × PBS and treated with 0.2 mL of 
citric acid buffer (citric acid 40 mM, potassium chloride 10 mM, sodium chloride 135 mM, 
pH 3.0) for 1 min to inactivate bound, but not internalized, viruses as described (Talarico et 
al., 2005). Plaque assay was performed with the BHK-21 cells immediately. The PFU 
numbers in EtOH-treated samples were set to 100%.
ZIKV Infection in Mice
3- to 4-week-old female BALB/c orA129 mice were treated with 25HC (50 mg/kg) or the 
HβCD vehicle intraperitoneally (i.p.) 12 hr prior to infection i.p. with ZIKV strain

 GZ01/2016. The treatment was continued daily for seven days. Mice were observed daily for 
signs of illness or morbidity until 21 dpi. The survival rate was evaluated using the Log-rank 
(Mantel-Cox) test. Viral RNA in serum at 4 and 7 dpi and that in brain at 7 dpi were 
determined by qRT-PCR. The alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity in serum at 7 dpi was 
detected using ALT activity assay kit (Sigma).
ZIKV Infection in Monkeys and Luminex Assay
Rhesus monkeys (Macacamulatta) were administered with EtOH or 25HC intravenously 
(i.v.) at 1.5 mg/kg of body weight 24 hr pre- or 4 hr post- intramuscular (i.m.) infection with 
1×105 or 1×103 PFU of ZIKV GZ01 strain. They were subsequently treated with 25HC or 
EtOH daily for 7 days, and their body temperature and clinical signs were monitored daily. 
The blood and urine samples were collected from 0–7 dpi for viral load analysis by qRT-
PCR. The serum collected at 0, 3, and 7 dpi were subjected to cytokine analysis with 
Monkey Cytokine Magnetic 29-Plex Panel (Thermo Fisher, LPC0005M) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. The data were collected on Luminex200 and analyzed by 
Luminex xPONENT (Thermo Fisher).
ZIKV Infection in the Embryonic Mouse Brain
The ICR mice were pretreated with 25HC (50 mg/kg, i.p. injected) or vehicle (HβCD) 6 hr 
prior to viral infection. The right side of the lateral ventricle/LV of the E13.5 fetal brains 
were infected with 1 µL of ZIKV stock (6.5 × 105 PFU/mL) using glass micropipettes as 
described (Li et al., 2016a). Pregnant mice were treated with 25HC or vehicle (HβCD) 6 hr 
pre- and 6 hr post-ZIKV infection, followed by daily treatment for 5 days. For each pregnant 
dam, around ½ of the littermates were injected with ZIKV, and the others were injected with 
culture medium (mock) for proper controls.
Immunofluorescence Staining and Confocal Imaging and Quantification
For cryosections, tissues were fixed in 4% PFA then dehydrated in 30% sucrose and frozen 
in tissue freezing medium (TFM). Slices (thickness: 40 µm) were blocked at room 
temperature for 1 hr with 10% horse serum, 0.3% Triton X-100, and 5% BSA in PBS as 
described (Li et al., 2016a). The primary antibodies were applied overnight at the following 
concentrations: anti-phospho-histone3 (P-H3) (CST, 9701S, 1:1000), anti-activated-caspase3 
(CST, 9664s, 1:500), anti-tbr1 (Abcam, ab31940, 1:500). Serumfrom a ZIKV-infected 
patient (1:100), a healthy non-ZIKV infected volunteer (1:100), or mice immunized with 
recombinant ZIKV FSS13025/2010 (GenBank: JN860885) envelope (E) protein was used 
(1:500). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Thermo Fisher). Slices were imaged on an LSM 
700 (Carl Zeiss) confocal microscope, and the images were analyzed with Imaris and 
ImageJ.
