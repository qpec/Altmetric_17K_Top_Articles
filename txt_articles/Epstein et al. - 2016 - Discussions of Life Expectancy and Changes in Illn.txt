Purpose
Accurate illness understanding enables patients to make informed decisions. Evidence of the in-
fluence of prognostic discussions on the accuracy of illness understanding by patients would
demonstrate the value of discussions.
Methods
Recent and past oncology provider-patient discussions about prognosis/life expectancy were ex-
amined for their association with changes in illness understanding by patients. Patients (N = 178)
with advanced cancers refractory to prior chemotherapy whom oncologists expected to die within
6 months were interviewed before and after a visit in which cancer restaging scan results were
discussed. Illness understanding scores were the sum of four indicator variables: patient terminal
illness acknowledgment, recognition of incurable disease status, knowledge of the advanced stage
of the disease, and expectation to live months as opposed to years.
Results
Before the restaging scan visit, nine (5%) of 178 patients had completely accurate illness un-
derstanding (ie, correctly answered each of the four illness understanding questions). Eighteen
patients (10%) reported only recent discussions of prognosis/life expectancy with their oncologists;
68 (38%) reported only past discussions; 24 (13%) reported both recent and past discussions; and
68 (38%) reported that they never had discussions of prognosis/life expectancy with their oncol-
ogists. After adjustment for potential confounders (ie, education and race/ethnicity), analysis
identified significant, positive changes in illness understanding scores for patients in groups that
reported recent only (least-squares mean change score, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.23 to 1.01; P = .002) and
both recent and past (least-squares mean change score, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.70; P = 0.028)
discussions of prognosis/life expectancy with their oncologists.
Conclusion
Patients with advanced cancer who report recent discussions of prognosis/life expectancy with their
oncologists come to have a better understanding of the terminal nature of their illnesses.

INTRODUCTION
Informed consent remains a cornerstone of med-
ical decision making, but, for myriad reasons,1
oncologists often struggle with whether and how
best to convey sensitive information about prog-
noses to their patients with advanced cancer.
Sometimes, oncologists do not share information
with patients about a terminal cancer prognosis.2,3
However, information from physicians about end-
of-life care is often wanted by patients4,5 and is
related to patient receipt of higher-quality care near
death.3,6 As highlighted in a recent Institute of
Medicine report,7 patient-physician communica-
tion at the end of life is a promising target for
improvement of the delivery of patient-centered
end-of-life care.
Often, patients with common advanced
cancers have inaccurate illness understanding and
would benefit from effective prognostic com-
munication. Many patients mistakenly believe
that their cancers are curable when they are not. A
recent study of patients with advanced lung and
colorectal cancer found that 69% and 81%, re-
spectively, believed that the chemotherapy they
received was intended to cure them.8 These data
suggest a need for oncologists to share prognostic

 information that is relevant to the understanding of the intent
of treatment. Nevertheless, many oncologists are reluctant to do
so, because they worry that, by sharing prognostic information,
they will make patients needlessly hopeless or upset3 and/or that
patients will view them less favorably as a result.8 Some evidence
suggests that, at least in the short run, physicians who share
prognostic information are viewed less positively by their
patients,8 but other findings suggest that the sharing of prog-
nostic information does not damage the oncologist-patient
relationship.4,6
Research has shown that accurate prognostic understanding
is associated with anxiety and worse quality of life9 and that
training clinicians to communicate about end-of-life care may
actually result in higher patient depression scores.10 However,
patients who report engagement in end-of-life discussions have
not been shown to be more depressed or worried.3,4,6 Studies
show that patients with serious illness do not lose hope,11 suffer,12
or die sooner13 as a result of end-of-life discussions. Bereaved
caregivers also do not incur lasting psychological harms from
such discussions.3 Thus, the effects of prognostic communication
on care,3,6 patient mood, and patient relationships with their
oncologists have been studied. However, research is needed to
determine the effect of prognostic communication on illness
understanding by patients. Specifically, the impact of prognostic
discussions on patient understanding of disease status, curability,
and life expectancy has not been examined with data designed
explicitly for this purpose. Such data would provide guidance on
how to communicate more effectively to promote illness un-
derstanding in patients.
This study sought to evaluate the effects of recent and past
clinical discussions about prognosis on changes in illness un-
derstanding by patients with advanced cancer. We hypothesized
that recent and ongoing prognostic discussions would improve
illness understanding in patients.
METHODS
Study Sample
The analyzed patient sample (N = 178) was drawn from the Coping
with Cancer II (CwC-II) study. CwC-II is a National Cancer Institute–
funded, prospective, multi-institutional cohort study of patients with
advanced cancer and their oncology providers designed to evaluate how
end-of-life communication affects illness understanding by patients.
Participants were recruited at nine US cancer centers: Dana-Farber/
Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,
Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Massachusetts General Hospital,
Boston, MA), Parkland Hospital (Dallas, TX), Simmons Comprehen-
sive Cancer Center (Dallas, TX), Yale Cancer Center (New Haven, CT),
Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medical College (New York, NY),
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY), Virginia
Commonwealth University Massey Cancer Center (Richmond, VA),
University of New Mexico Cancer Center (Albuquerque, NM), and
Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center (Pomona, CA).
Patients had to meet the following eligibility criteria: stage IV
gastrointestinal, lung, or gynecologic cancer and select incurable and
poor-prognosis stage III cancers (eg, pancreas and lung); oncologist-
estimated life expectancy of 6 or fewer months; disease progression after
at least one chemotherapy regimen or, in the case of advanced colo-
rectal cancers, progression during treatment with two chemotherapy
regimens. Additional eligibility criteria included age of at least 21 years
and the ability to complete the study interviews. Patients with cognitive
impairment (eg, rater-perceived inability to provide reliable responses
and validly respond to the questions posed of them) were excluded.
Institutional review boards of all participating institutions approved
study procedures, and all participants provided written, informed
consent.
This study focused on changes in illness understanding by pa-
tients before and after a visit with his or her oncology provider to
discuss scan results and to evaluate disease progression. A total of
178 CwC-II participants who completed both pre- and post-scan visit
interviews between January 2011 and February 2015 were included in
the analyses.
Measures
Patient characteristics. Patients provided information about age,
sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, and health insurance
status.
Changes in illness understanding by patients. In pre- and post-scan
interviews, patients were asked four questions that assessed their ter-
minal illness acknowledgment (TIA), recognition of their incurable
disease status, knowledge of the advanced stage of their disease, and
expectation to live months as opposed to years. These elements of illness
understanding were deemed by us to be essential for patients to make
informed decisions about end-of-life care. Responses were coded 1 or
0 to indicate the presence or absence, respectively, of each of these
elements of illness understanding by patients. These four indicators
were then added together to construct summary scores (possible range,
0 to 4) to reflect illness understanding at the times of both the pre- and
post-scan visit interviews. Differences between pre- and post-scan visit
illness understanding scores (possible range, 24 to 4) were used to
define changes in illness understanding by a patient between te pre- and
post-scan visit interviews.
TIA was assessed with the question “How would you describe your
current health status?” Response options were (1) relatively healthy,
(2) relatively healthy and terminally ill, (3) seriously ill but not terminally
ill, (4) seriously ill and terminally ill, and (5) do not know. TIA was coded
1 for responses options 2 and 4 and 0 for response options 1, 3, and 5.
Recognition of an incurable disease status was assessed with the
question “Which of the following best represents what your oncology
providers have told you about a cure for your cancer?” Response options
were (1) my cancer will be cured, (2) my cancer may be cured if treatments
are successful, (3) my cancer cannot be cured but we will try to control the
cancer with treatment, (4) my cancer cannot be cured and I am not able to
have any additional cancer treatment, and (5) do not know. Recognition
of incurable disease was coded 1 for response options 3 and 4 and 0 for
response options 1, 2, and 5.
Knowledge of advanced stage of cancer was assessed with the question
“What stage is your cancer?” Responses were (1) no evidence of cancer,
(2) early stage of cancer, (3) middle stage of cancer, (4) late stage of cancer,
(5) end stage of cancer, and (6) do not know. Knowledge of advanced stage
of cancer was coded 1 for responses options 4 and 5 and 0 for response
options 1, 2, 3, and 6.
Expectation to live months as opposed to years was assessed with
the question “Many patients have thoughts about how having cancer
might affect their life expectancy, either on the basis of what their
doctors have told them, what they have read, or just their own sense
about how long they might live with cancer. When you think about this,
do you think in terms of (select response)?” Response options were
(1) months, (2) years, and (3) do not know. Expectation to live months as
opposed to years was coded 1 for response option 1 and 0 for response
options 2 and 3.
Patient-oncologist discussions of prognosis/life expectancy. During the
post-scan visit, patients were asked “At the last oncology visit, was there
any discussion of your prognosis or life expectancy with this disease?”
and “Have you discussed your prognosis/life expectancy with your
oncology provider in past visits?” Response options for each of these

Epstein et al
 questions were yes or no. Responses to these questions were used to
identify patients who reported discussions at only recent (last visit),
only past (prior to last visit), or both recent and past visits or never
having discussions of prognosis/life expectancy with the oncologist.
Statistical Analysis
To evaluate potential sociodemographic confounders, differences in
age and education between groups of patients who reported recent only,
past only, both recent and past, and never having discussions of prognosis/
life expectancy with oncologists were examined with means and standard
deviations (SDs); between-group differences in sex, race/ethnicity, marital
status, and insurance status were examined with distributions of absolute
and relative frequencies. Correlations between age or education and pre-
and post-scan visit illness understanding scores, and change in illness
understanding score, were used to evaluate associations between age or
education and illness understanding. Change in illness understanding and
differences in pre-scan visit and post-scan visit understanding on the basis
of sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, and insurance status were examined
with means and standard deviations.
Mean changes in illness understanding scores for patients who re-
ported recent only, past only, both recent and past, and never having
discussions of prognosis/life expectancy with oncologists, adjusted for
potential patient demographic confounders, were estimated via least-
squares means in a generalized linear model of changes in illness un-
derstanding by patients. Minimum effect sizes for changes in illness
understanding scores for tests with adequate (80%) statistical power for the
full sample (N = 178) and for subgroups with 20 or 60 patients were 0.17,
0.53, and 0.29, respectively. Time between interviews was unrelated to
changes in illness understanding and, therefore, was not considered
a confounder in the analysis.
Statistical analysis was conducted with SAS statistical software,
version 9.4 (Cary, NC) and was based on two-sided tests. P , .05 was
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
The median time between the pre- and post-scan interviews was
6 weeks (range, 1 to 32 weeks). At pre-scan interviews, 32 patients
(18%) had an illness understanding score of 0; 48 (27%), of 1;
47 (26%), of 2; 42 (24%), of 3; and nine (5%), of 4. Post-scan
interviews revealed that 26 (15%), 46 (26%), 49 (28%), 44 (25%),
and 13 (7%) had illness understanding scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4,
respectively. Between interviews, three patients (2%) had a change
in illness understanding score of 22; 29 (16%) had a change score
of 21; 96 (54%) had a change score of 0; 41 (23%) had a change
score of +1; and nine (5%) had a change score of +2. According to
patient reports, 18 (10%) had only recent discussions of prognosis/
life expectancy with the oncologist; 68 (38%) had only past dis-
cussions; 24 (13%) had both recent and past discussions; and
68 (38%) never had discussions of prognosis/life expectancy with
the oncologist.
As listed in Table 1, patients who reported only past (n = 68)
or both recent and past (n = 24) discussions were more highly
educated (mean years of education: 15.3; SD, 3.0 and 15.3; SD,
2.7, respectively) than patients who reported only recent (n = 18)
or never having (n = 68) discussions (mean years of education:
13.4; SD, 2.9 and 13.3; SD, 4.2, respectively). Black patients were
more highly represented in the recent only and never having
discussions groups (4 [22%] of 18 patients and 15 [22%] of
68 patients, respectively) and were less highly represented in the
past discussions only group (3[4%] of 68 patients). Married
patients were more highly represented in the only past dis-
cussions group (47 [70%] of 67 patients) and were less rep-
resented in the both recent and past discussions group (10 [43%]
of 23 patients).
Table 2 lists changes in illness understanding scores by
characteristic, including the following: Black patients (n = 25) had
negative changes in illness understanding scores (mean, 20.24;
SD, 1.01), and Latino (n = 19) and white (n = 134) patients had
positive changes in illness understanding scores (mean, 0.37; SD,
0.76 and mean, 0.17; SD, 0.75, respectively). Overall, patients
(N = 178) had positive changes in illness understanding scores
(mean, 0.13; SD, 0.81).

Prognostic Discussions and Illness Understanding
 Table 3 lists mean changes in elements of illness under-
standing, stratified by discussions of prognosis/life expectancy.
The largest contributors to changes in illness understand-
ing among patients who reported only recent discussions of
prognosis/life expectancy (n = 18; mean change, 0.50; SD,
0.86) were changes in understanding of incurability (mean,
0.17; SD, 0.38) and late stage of disease (mean, 0.17; SD, 0.62).
The largest contributors to changes in illness understand-
ing among patients who reported both recent and past dis-
cussions (n = 24; mean change, 0.38; SD, 0.92) were changes
in understanding of late stage of disease (mean, 0.21; SD, 0.51)
and in expectations to live months, not years (mean, 0.21;
SD, 0.41).
In Table 4, results adjusted for potential confounders (ie,
patient years of education and race/ethnicity) are listed. Groups
of patients who reported recent only and both recent and past
discussions of prognosis/life expectancy with their oncologists
had significant, positive changes in their illness understanding
scores (least-squares mean change score: 0.62; 95% CI ,0.23 to
1.01; P = .002 and 0.37; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.70; P = .028,
respectively).
DISCUSSION
Results of this study demonstrate how poorly patients with
advanced cancer understand their prognoses and how effective
recent prognostic discussions are to improve illness understand-
ing by patients. All enrolled patients in this study had incurable
cancer that was at an advanced stage (eg, late, stage IV gastro-
intestinal cancer) and a life expectancy of months, not years.
A small minority of patients accurately, and completely, un-
derstood the gravity of their illnesses (eg, 5% endorsed each
element of the terminal prognosis at study entry); approximately
one in four (23%) reported only recent or recent and past dis-
cussion of prognosis with the oncologist. Patients who reported
at least a recent discussion about prognosis with the oncology
provider exhibited significant improvements in illness under-
standing. These results highlight the need for timely (ie, current)
prognostic disclosures to terminally ill patients who meet the
criteria used for this study. The results also suggest that on-
cologists should discuss prognosis on an ongoing basis, and as
frequently as appropriate, with their terminally ill patients. If this

 occurred, patients would likely have better illness understand-
ing and, thus, make more informed decisions about their end-of-
life care.
These results are consistent with, and advance, the existing
literature on illness understanding, prognostic disclosure, and
advance care planning. The effect of recently reported prognostic
discussions on improvements in illness understanding by patients
is in line with the advance care planning strategy to regularly and
dually address both dynamic medical situations and individual
patient goals. This approach encourages medical decisions to be
made in the moment14 instead of on the basis of advance directive
documents, which can sometimes be nonspecific, outdated, or
unavailable.15,16 Consideration of prognostic understanding as
an evolving awareness of one’s changing health empowers pa-
tients, their loved ones, and their healthcare team to make
informed decisions. Furthermore, recognition of the need to
update patients frequently about a prognosis may help patients
and families who struggle17 to come to terms with the terminal
nature of a disease.
In the delicate task of delivering prognoses, some have
argued that the median informs the message,18 which argues for
the use of a prognostic range such as months instead of com-
munication of a specific time frame, such as 6 months to live.
Outcomes research in strategies of communicating with both
realism and hope18 for patients with serious illness is needed;
statements, such as hoping for the best (eg, years of survival)
while being prepared for the worst (eg, months left to live),
during ongoing discussions of prognosis may be one way to
achieve a balance. This report suggests that, regardless of the
approach, the recency of the prognostic discussion matters for
prognostic understanding by the patient. Future research is
needed to identify the most effective ways to communicate
prognostic information to ensure that patients have accurate
illness understanding. Such insight seems to be a prerequisite for
informed decision making.
There are strengths and limitations to our study. One strength
is that our data were drawn from a large, prospective, obser-
vational cohort of patients from several centers and with cancers
representative of common terminal illnesses, in a study explicitly
designed to discern the effects of oncology provider commu-
nication on terminal illness understanding by patients. To our
knowledge, our study is the first to directly address and dem-
onstrate these associations between the timing of patient-
reported prognostic discussions and improvements in illness
understanding by patients. One weakness is that patients who do
not know their cancer stages or prognoses might also inaccurately
recall whether their doctors have talked with them about such
topics. This notion of discord, because of optimism bias19 or
misunderstanding between what physicians say and what pa-
tients19 or caregivers20 hear has been described in oncology
settings.20 If patients misheard what was said, the effect was likely
in the direction of underreporting prognostic discussions; this
would suggest that prognostic discussions by oncologists would
have less impact. We contend that, for informed decision making,
how patients hear and understand what their oncology providers
say about their illnesses matters the most.
Despite these limitations, future research directions include
additional elucidation of the communication elements that are
beneficial (or deleterious) to patient understanding and that
promote advance care planning. Studies to investigate the com-
bined use of booklets and audio recordings21 for education to
patients with cancer about the chemotherapies they will receive
have proven effective. Larger-scale validation of these approaches is
warranted, as is ongoing research into other educational media,
such as videos,22 for these and other topics of importance to patients
with cancer and their loved ones. Communication decision aids for
caregivers themselves have also been effective advance care planning
strategies.23 Although the impact of communication skills training
on patient outcomes has recently been called into question,10 other
data show that communication skills training, whether as work-
shops24-26 or technologies for individual practice,27 can at least help
clinicians acquire these important communication skills. Ongoing
research into communication skills training needs to examine the
interplay between cognitive information delivery (eg, commu-
nication about the prognostic realities of an advanced cancer as
realistically and hopefully as possible) and response to emotion
(eg, patient sadness, anxiety, anger) with empathic responses and
the effects that such skills have on illness understanding by
patients.28
In conclusion, patients with advanced cancer who acknowl-
edge recent or ongoing discussions of prognosis/life expectancy
with their oncology providers come to have a better understanding
of the terminal nature of their illnesses and, thus, may be better
prepared to make informed end-of-life care decisions.
