Abstract
Plasmodium vivax is a major public health burden, responsible for the majority of malaria 
infections outside Africa. We explored the impact of demographic history and selective pressures 
on the P. vivax genome by sequencing 182 clinical isolates sampled from 11 countries across the 
globe, using hybrid selection to overcome human DNA contamination. We confirmed previous 
reports of high genomic diversity in P. vivax relative to the more virulent Plasmodium falciparum 
species; regional populations of P. vivax exhibited greater diversity than the global P. falciparum 
population, indicating a large and/or stable population. Signals of natural selection suggest that P. 
vivax is evolving in response to antimalarial drugs and is adapting to regional differences in the 
human host and the mosquito vector. These findings underline the variable epidemiology of this 
parasite species and highlight the breadth of approaches that may be required to eliminate P. vivax 
globally.
P. vivax causes an estimated 15.8 million clinical malaria cases each year1 but remains 
understudied in comparison to P. falciparum because of its lower mortality and lack of a 
continuous in vitro culture system. Small-scale surveys of samples collected from human 
patients (‘isolates’) in the last century and adapted for propagation in splenectomized 
monkeys have indicated higher genetic diversity for P. vivax relative to P. falciparum and 
discordant phylogeographical histories for the two species2, likely caused, in part, by the 
unique ability of P. vivax to persist in a dormant state in the liver for months or years. This 
capacity for dormancy has enabled P. vivax to historically cause infections in Europe and 
North America, where the temperate climate disfavors year-round transmission by 
mosquitoes3.
We used hybrid selection4 to enrich parasite DNA in blood samples heavily contaminated 
with human DNA obtained from patients infected with P. vivax, collected as part of the 
International Centers of Excellence for Malaria Research program5. We sequenced 182 
isolates from 11 countries across the globe (Fig. 1) and obtained high sequencing depth and 
quality for the majority of samples. Hybrid selection using synthetic baits (Online Methods 
and Supplementary Fig. 1) increased the fraction of parasite DNA in all but four samples, 
with the greatest enrichment in samples obtained starting with <1% parasite DNA (Fig. 2). 
We supplemented these new data with published sequences from patient isolates and 
monkey-adapted laboratory lines for a final data set of 195 P. vivax genomes

 (Supplementary Table 1). We aligned reads to the Salvador I reference genome assembly6 
and ‘called’ SNP variants as described in Supplementary Figure 2. Because P. vivax is 
haploid in the human host, we used rates of heterozygous variant calls to classify 122 of the 
newly sequenced isolates as single-genotype infections and inferred the remaining 41 
samples with sufficient coverage as multigenotype (‘complex’) infections (Online Methods 
and Supplementary Fig. 3). We restricted our population genetic analyses of diversity and 
divergence to single-genotype isolates.
We performed a principal-component analysis (PCA; Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 4) on 
the SNP variants to explore the global population structure of P. vivax. Similar to a recent 
microsatellite study7, the major axis of differentiation divides the New World from Old 
World samples. Given recent evidence for an African origin of P. vivax8, it has been 
proposed that New World P. vivax populations had been founded during the colonial era by a 
now-extirpated European parasite population9. The second and third principal components 
define a distinct Papua New Guinea (PNG) cluster and a cluster of isolates from Mexico, 
respectively. We estimated the fraction of the genome exhibiting identity by descent among 
pairs of samples from geographical regions harboring at least 12 single-genotype isolates 
(Online Methods) and predicted that isolates sampled from Mexico have recent common 
ancestry (Supplementary Fig. 5), explaining their unusual clustering. Malaria in Mexico has 
steadily declined over the last decade to <10,000 cases1, and the circulation of genetically 
similar P. vivax may improve prospects for disease control. In contrast to the P. vivax 
population in Mexico, the PNG population is very diverse from other P. vivax populations. 
Our data support a set of SNPs that differentiate P. vivax populations from those in the 
Americas, Asia and PNG, with applications for extending the ability to identify the source of 
imported infections10 via SNP barcoding11 or other genotyping methodologies.
Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis yielded a tree concordant with the PCA (Fig. 
3b), highlighting the distinctiveness of the PNG population (alternative reference genome 
maximum-likelihood trees with bootstrap values are available in Supplementary Fig. 6). We 
also observed a cluster of African (Mauritania and Madagascar) isolates that grouped closely 
with Indian isolates midway between the clades from Asia and the Americas. Previous 
studies of P. vivax mitochondrial diversity have identified shared or similar haplotypes 
among small numbers of sequenced African and Indian/Pakistani samples9,12, suggesting 
that P. vivax was potentially reintroduced to Africa from South Asia by colonial seafarers 
after its virtual extirpation in Africa owing to the spread of the infection-deterring Duffy-
negative mutation in human populations13. Given that the nuclear genome undergoes sexual 
recombination, the present data sets potentially offer a more sensitive history of gene flow 
between populations than mitochondrial data. Admixture analysis of the nuclear SNP data 
(Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 7) suggests that the isolates from India and Africa exhibit a 
highly heterogeneous ancestry relative to isolates from other populations, and we inferred 
that they may derive from both New and Old World lineages. This finding adds support to 
the hypothesis that contemporary African and South Asian P. vivax populations are 
genetically similar and suggests that South Asian P. vivax populations may have genetically 
mingled with European (‘New World’) lineages during the colonial era or could reflect 
ancient connections between human populations in the eastern Mediterranean, the Middle 
East and the Indian subcontinent inferred from admixture signals in human genetic data14.

 The transatlantic slave trade that occurred between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries 
continues to shape the contemporary epidemiology of malaria in South America. 
Genotyping the human Duffy mutation identified no homozygous samples in our collection 
(Supplementary Table 1) but identified ten samples from Colombian individuals that were 
heterozygous, five of whom self-identified as having African ancestry. In this setting of non-
African parasites infecting people of partial African descent, we observed the dominance of 
disease susceptibility conferred by the wild-type Duffy allele. Further, we found no evidence 
of increased copy number of the P. vivax Duffy-binding protein gene hypothesized to 
overcome the barrier to infection presented by Duffy negativity in Madagascar15 
(Supplementary Table 1). South American P. vivax epidemiology reflects recent contact 
between humans and parasites introduced to this region from disparate geographical 
locations.
Our previous studies of P. vivax have highlighted its high diversity in comparison to P. 
falciparum, suggesting a larger and/or more stable effective population size, but were limited 
by sample size2. In this expanded data set, we found that even the least genetically diverse P. 
vivax subpopulation in our study was more diverse than a sampling of diverse P. falciparum 
isolates (Fig. 4). All of our sampled P. vivax populations were significantly more diverse 
than P. falciparum (P < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), with Old World populations 
showing nearly twice as much nucleotide diversity. The population samples from Myanmar 
and Thailand were as diverse as the PNG samples, suggesting that the high divergence of the 
PNG population is due to protracted genetic isolation and not an elevated mutation rate. The 
most diverse genes are antigenic, such as members of the merozoite surface protein 3 
(MSP3)16 and MSP7 multigene families and the serine-repeat antigen family (SERA)17, 
genes important for immune evasion (Supplementary Fig. 8).
To explore the genomic profile of divergence and selection among P. vivax populations, we 
calculated the fixation index (FST) across each chromosome for pairs of well-sampled 
populations separated by differing geographical distances. The divergence profile we 
observed in a comparison of Old World versus New World single-genotype samples (Fig. 
5a) was not generally similar to the profile that we observed in a comparison of samples 
from PNG and Thailand. Indeed, there were some notable differences suggesting 
population-specific selection pressures (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 2). Among the 
genes exhibiting similar signals of divergence for both the proximal and distal geographical 
comparisons were two loci associated with antifolate drug resistance in P. falciparum: DHPS 
(dihydropteroate synthase) and DHFR-TS (dihydrofolate reductase–thymidylate synthase). 
DHPS and DHFR-TS genes also reside in regions of heightened linkage disequilibrium (Fig. 
5c,d), suggesting that they have been subjected to selective sweeps. These results indicate 
that sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine and other antifolate drugs constitute the most important 
recent evolutionary pressure on P. vivax parasite populations. Application of a McDonald–
Kreitman test to P. vivax genes with orthologs in the sister taxon Plasmodium cynomolgi18 
of Southeast Asian macaques identified strong signals of selection on other genes, including 
several associated with red blood cell invasion, for example, MAEBL (merozoite-adhesive 
erythrocytic binding protein; Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary Table 3). Other 
notable genes identified as potentially adapting to regional differences in the human host or

 the mosquito vector, or due to the influence of other environmental variables, are indicated 
in Table 1 and Supplementary Figures 10–15.
We also observed a divergence signal on chromosome 12 enhanced in the New World versus 
Old World comparison relative to the PNG versus Thailand comparison. The divergence 
signal was centered on a surface-expressed gamete gene, Pvs47 (Fig. 5e), orthologous to a 
locus in P. falciparum (Pfs47) that is a strong determinant of successful evasion of the 
mosquito JNK immune response19 and that was likely subjected to selection as P. falciparum 
adapted to New World vectors during the colonial era20. New World anopheline vectors 
belong to the subgenus Nyssorhynchus, which diverged from the lineage leading to Old 
World anopheline mosquitoes approximately 100 million years ago21, and likely presented 
comparable evolutionary challenges to both P. falciparum and P. vivax after human-mediated 
introduction of malaria parasites to the New World in the last 500 years. Concordant with 
the hypothesis that Pvs47 was subject to strong selection upon the arrival of P. vivax in the 
New World, we observed considerably reduced haplotype diversity in Mexican, Colombian, 
Brazilian and Peruvian P. vivax populations in comparison with Old World populations (Fig. 
5f), a pattern that was not exhibited by DHFR-TS or DHPS (Supplementary Fig. 16) but 
which has been observed previously in P. falciparum for Pfs47 (ref. 22). Despite reduced 
haplotype diversity and strong divergence between populations, Pvs47 did not exhibit 
heightened linkage disequilibrium (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Fig. 14), suggesting that it 
was subject to selection less recently than the DHFR-TS and DHPS drug resistance loci.
Our global survey of genomic diversity in P. vivax provides insights into the population 
structure, demographic history and selective pressures acting upon this species, 
contextualizing and extending previous, smaller-scale observations2. Just as malaria has 
influenced the human genome23, this P. vivax global genomic data set reflects ongoing 
evolutionary interactions with the parasite's human and mosquito hosts, interactions that are 
likely to intensify as disease elimination efforts escalate.
Online Methods
Sample collection, hybrid selection and DNA sequencing
We collected venous blood samples from P. vivax-infected patients after obtaining informed 
consent and following ethical approval at the local institutional review board of each 
participating site. Details of the sites are available in the Supplementary Note. The monkey-
adapted P. vivax strains Panama (MRA-343), Vietnam ONG (MRA-341) and Nicaragua I 
(MRA-340) were obtained from the Malaria Research and Reference Reagents Resource 
(see URLs). We extracted genomic DNA from each sample and used a modified nested PCR 
method targeting the multicopy small-subunit ribosomal gene of P. vivax for species 
confirmation33. We constructed 200-bp-insert Illumina libraries for each isolate and 
performed hybrid selection on each sequencing library using genome-wide baits to enrich 
parasite DNA, with synthetic oligonucleotide baits to test maximum possible enrichment, as 
described4. We sequenced the hybrid-selected libraries with 101-bp paired-end reads in 
indexed batches of 12 on Illumina HiSeq 2000 or 2500 lanes and evaluated parasite DNA 
enrichment by comparing the fraction of HiSeq reads mapping to the P. vivax reference

 genome assembly to the mapping fraction observed in low sequencing coverage generated 
on the MiSeq platform.
Human Duffy antigen/chemokine receptor and P. vivax Duffy-binding protein genotyping
We determined the genotype of the human Duffy antigen/chemokine receptor (DARC) of P. 
vivax-infected patients by using Burrows-Wheeler aligner (BWA)34 to align fastq files of 
177 sequenced isolates against the DARC nucleotide sequence (human genome Build 38) 
and visualizing read alignments. These were classified as either Duffy homozygous positive, 
homozygous negative or heterozygous according to the presence of a point mutation in the 
promoter region (a T>C mutation at position −33 in the GATA box). The in silico results 
were validated using a modified wet-lab assay35 (Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary 
Note). We mapped all paired-end reads for each isolate to the P. vivax Salvador I reference 
genome and used the indel detection software Pindel36 to detect P. vivax Duffy-binding 
protein (DBP) gene duplications. We validated these results by PCR amplification of 
flanking regions of DBP37.
Sequence processing and alignment
We aligned reads from all isolates to the Salvador I reference genome assembly using 
BWA34 with default parameters and processed the resulting alignments using SAMtools38 
and Picard v1.66. We obtained sequence data for 12 previously published P. vivax isolates 
from the Sequence Read Archive, converted them into fastq format and aligned them to 
Salvador I. We used REALPHY39 software to assess whether our choice of reference 
genome assembly biased variant calls used for downstream analyses, using two alternative P. 
vivax reference genomes, North Korean and Mauritania I (ref. 2) (Supplementary Fig. 6).
SNP discovery and quality filtering
We used the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) UnifiedGenotyper40 to identify SNPs in 
each isolate according to GATK best practices41 as part of a SNP identification pipeline 
(Supplementary Fig. 2). We used two parameters to exclude low-quality sites: GQ ≥ 40 and 
QUAL ≥ 30. We filtered SNP variants in single and complex infections according to separate 
criteria and removed all heterozygous calls from the single-genotype data set 
(Supplementary Fig. 2). After merging variant calls from all isolates, we removed calls from 
sites exhibiting a low call rate across the sample set and sites occurring in members of the 
highly repetitive P. vivax variant interspersed repeat (vir) multigene family.
Single-genotype versus multigenotype infection classification
To distinguish legitimate heterozygous variants in infections containing multiple genotypes 
from spurious heterozygous calls, we identified a trusted set of variants exhibiting high-
quality homozygous calls for two or more segregating alleles in individual samples. This 
curated homozygous reference variant set was then used to measure the prevalence of 
heterozygous SNPs for each isolate, such that only in mixed infections should multiple 
alternative genotypes be observed. We classified samples as containing more than one 
genotype if they exhibited greater than 1,236 heterozygous variants (Supplementary Fig. 3).

 Population structure
We used a set of filtered variant calls without heterozygous polymorphisms to visualize 
relationships between P. vivax populations using PCA implemented in the SNPRelate R 
library42. We used a combination of two and three eigenvectors to represent the structure of 
the polymorphism in the population. A more conservative PCA, limited to high-quality (at 
least 1 million callable sites) single-genotype isolates, was used to confirm the topology 
(Supplementary Fig. 4). We constructed maximum-likelihood trees using the filtered variant 
call set limited to homozygous polymorphisms in high-quality P. vivax isolates using 
RAxML43 and performed admixture analysis with the Admixture software package44 using 
the full set of homozygous filtered variant SNPs.
Genetic diversity
We calculated genome-wide nucleotide diversity (π) and Tajima's D from high-quality, 
single-genotype isolates (Supplementary Table 1) using R and Python custom scripts to 
tabulate all classes of segregating sites using filtered homozygous variant calls. In addition, 
we calculated π for 574 one-to-one high-quality orthologs in P. falciparum and P. vivax. We 
calculated FST using the VCFTools package45. We identified identical-by-descent genomic 
regions in pairwise comparisons of isolates using a hidden Markov model analysis of SNP 
variants46.
Tests of neutrality/selection
We used data for 81 high-coverage, single-genotype infection isolates to search for signals 
of natural selection using a McDonald-Kreitman test and the P. cynolmolgi B strain 
reference genome as an outgroup47. We created coding-sequence alignments using P. vivax 
population sequence and the single-copy orthologs between species for 2,254 genes using 
the program MUSCLE48. We performed a McDonald-Kreitman test on the observed 
polymorphic and divergent synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations in each alignment 
and evaluated significance using a two-tailed χ2 test to obtain a P value. A q-value error 
correction was applied to the set of 2,254 gene tests to correct for multiple sampling49. We 
also calculated α for each gene, a summary statistic that estimates the proportion of 
substitutions fixed by natural selection50, using a custom script.

 Figure 1. 
Country of origin for 195 P. vivax patient isolates indicated on a map of P. vivax malaria 
endemicity. Asterisks mark the five published monkey-adapted reference genomes Brazil I, 
Salvador I, Mauritania I, North Korean and India VII and the published Belem and Chesson 
strains. The four additional monkey-adapted strains, Vietnam ONG, Nicaragua I, Panama 
and Thailand Pakchong, sequenced as part of this study are also indicated. Numbers of 
clinical isolates are given in parentheses. Lines do not represent accurate within-country 
locations; locations are listed in supplementary table 1. The map was adapted from the 
Malaria MAP Project24

Enrichment of P. vivax DNA extracted from clinical samples using the hybrid selection 
method. (a) Enrichment of parasite DNA measured as the percentage of total sequence reads 
alignable to the P. vivax reference genome before versus after hybrid selection. Enrichment 
was variable but nearly universal. (b) Fold enrichment of parasite DNA, as compared to the 
percentage of alignable reads before hybrid selection. Hybrid selection resulted in the 
greatest fold enrichment for samples containing the lowest amount of parasite DNA before 
hybrid selection.

Global population structure of P. vivax. (a) Three-eigenvector PCA using variation data from 
all P. vivax isolates. Each isolate is colored according to its origin, and the percentage 
contribution of each eigenvector is indicated. (b) A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree 
with 50 bootstraps computed through alignment to the Salvador 1 reference genome. Colors 
and labels correspond to those in a, and the sister taxon to P. vivax, P. cynomolgi, was 
included as an outgroup. Select internal nodes are highlighted with open and closed circles, 
representing >40% and >70% bootstrap support, respectively. (c) Admixture analysis of the 
full set of variation data from 195 isolates using 100 bootstraps. Ancestry for each isolate 
was assessed according to an optimized cluster value of K = 5 (see supplementary Fig. 7 for 
admixture plots under six different K cluster values). Colors correspond to the 
subpopulations seen in a and b and were assigned to the five most deeply sampled 
subpopulations of P. vivax.

 Figure 4. 
Diversity in orthologs across six P. vivax subpopulations and P. falciparum. Box-and-
whisker plots of nucleotide diversity (π) calculated from 574 one-to-one orthologs in single-
infection, high-quality isolates from Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Thailand, Myanmar and 
Papua New Guinea subpopulations are shown. The center and ends of the boxes represent 
the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of π values for each subpopulation, and the whiskers on 
each plot represent the range of π within 1.5 times the interquartile range of the lower and 
upper quartiles. Data points beyond the range of the whiskers are plotted as black dots. For 
P. falciparum, π was calculated from orthologs in a population of 12 African isolates 
previously sequenced at the Broad Institute (see URLs). P. falciparum was significantly less 
diverse than all plotted P. vivax populations (P < 0.001) using both a paired Student's t test 
and a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

 Figure 5. 
Signals of selection in P. vivax subpopulations. (a) Genome-wide view of the divergence 
(FST) between Old World and New World populations calculated from 1-kb windows. 
Plotted is a moving average across each of the 14 chromosomes, with a histogram of FST 
values on the right. The 99th percentile of the distribution of 1-kb windows forms a cutoff 
for outliers, which are labeled with the nearest gene annotation to the peak FST. (b) FST 
comparison as in a between the Thailand and Papua New Guinea populations. (c–e) Detailed 
plots for DHPS (c), DHFR-TS (d) and Pvs47 (e), overlaying FST values from a and b, the 
collapsed estimate of mean linkage disequilibrium (LD) calculated across a 50-kb window 
for each nucleotide, a moving average of π in 1-kb windows for isolates from Southeast 
Asia and Tajima's D in 1-kb windows. The location of each gene is shown (pink bar) above a 
schematic of the gene. Homozygous variants within coding sequences are indicated, 
including nonsynonymous changes, synonymous changes and deletions. Polymorphism 
columns are scaled by their allele frequency in the global population. (f) Haplotype map for 
the P. vivax genes DHFR-TS and Pvs47. Red blocks denote nonsynonymous changes, gray 
blocks indicate the presence of the reference allele and white blocks show regions of missing 
data. Nonsynonymous sites in DHFR-TS are limited to derived alleles.

Some of the genes listed were identified as potentially adapting to regional differences in the human host or mosquito vector or due to the influence 
of other environmental variables because of a significant McDonald–Kreitman (MK) test, FST score or both. McDonald–Kreitman test results and 
the New World/Old World FST values for each gene are shown as z scores, and putative functions are given for the genes in P. falciparum or P. 
vivax where known. The P. vivax kelch12 propeller domain gene, the ortholog of an important drug resistance locus in P. falciparum, did not appear 
to be under selective pressure in our global set of P. vivax isolates and was also included.
