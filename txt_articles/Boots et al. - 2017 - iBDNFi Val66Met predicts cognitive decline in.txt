BDNF Val66Met predicts cognitive
decline in the Wisconsin Registry for
Alzheimer’s Prevention
ABSTRACT
Objective: To examine the influence of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met
polymorphism on longitudinal cognitive trajectories in a large, cognitively healthy cohort enriched
for Alzheimer disease (AD) risk and to understand whether b-amyloid (Ab) burden plays a moder-
ating role in this relationship.
Methods: One thousand twenty-three adults (baseline age 54.94 6 6.41 years) enrolled in the
Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention underwent BDNF genotyping and cognitive
assessment at up to 5 time points (average follow-up 6.92 6 3.22 years). A subset (n 5 140)
underwent 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) scanning. Covariate-adjusted mixed-effects regres-
sion models were used to elucidate the effect of BDNF on cognitive trajectories in 4 cognitive
domains, including verbal learning and memory, speed and flexibility, working memory, and imme-
diate memory. Secondary mixed-effects regression models were conducted to examine whether
Ab burden, indexed by composite PiB load, modified any observed BDNF-related cognitive
trajectories.
Results: Compared to BDNF Val/Val homozygotes, Met carriers showed steeper decline in verbal
learning and memory (p 5 0.002) and speed and flexibility (p 5 0.017). In addition, Ab burden
moderated the relationship between BDNF and verbal learning and memory such that Met car-
riers with greater Ab burden showed even steeper cognitive decline (p 5 0.033).
Conclusions: In a middle-aged cohort with AD risk, carriage of the BDNF Met allele was associ-
ated with steeper decline in episodic memory and executive function. This decline was exacer-
bated by greater Ab burden. These results suggest that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism may
play an important role in cognitive decline and could be considered as a target for novel AD
therapeutics. Neurology® 2017;88:2098–2106

Preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD) is thought to be a critical period for intervention therapies
that could potentially delay or prevent AD onset.1 Considerable focus has been placed on
genetic and environmental risk factors that may play a role in progression to AD and are
possibly targetable for intervention, including APOE e4,2,3 physical activity,4,5 and cognitive
reserve.6,7 Increasing evidence suggests that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may be
a genetic risk factor for AD. BDNF is a neurotrophin known to play roles in synaptic
plasticity, neurogenesis, neuronal survival, and cognitive health.8–10 Additional research sug-
gests that BDNF may moderate b-amyloid (Ab) accumulation, a hallmark feature of AD,1 by
reducing Ab-mediated cell death,11 decreasing Ab formation,12 and repairing Ab-induced
damage.13

 A polymorphism within the BDNF gene
(rs6265) causes a valine (Val) to methionine
(Met) substitution at codon 66 (Val66Met).
Carriage of 1 or 2 Met alleles is associated with
lower BDNF production,14 decreased hippo-
campal volume,15 and cognitive decline.16–19
However, null20,21 and opposite findings22,23
have been documented, making the relation-
ship between BDNF and cognition in aging
populations unclear.
Our primary objective was to investigate
whether BDNF is associated with longitudinal
cognitive trajectories within a large cohort of
middle-aged, cognitively healthy individuals
enriched for AD risk, a target population for
interventional therapies. Our secondary objec-
tive was to determine whether Ab burden
moderates the aforementioned relationship.
We hypothesized that BDNF Met carriers
would exhibit comparatively steeper cognitive
decline in all cognitive domains and that Ab
burden
would
exacerbate
this
cognitive
vulnerability.
METHODS Standard protocol approvals, registrations,
and
patient
consents.
The
University
of
Wisconsin
Institutional Review Board approved all study procedures, and
all
participants provided signed informed consent
before
participation.
Participants. Study participants were enrolled in the Wisconsin
Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention (WRAP), a longitudinal
study of persons 40 to 65 years of age and cognitively healthy
at study entry. Details about WRAP have been previously
described.24 For this study, 1,410 participants were selected on
the basis of available BDNF and APOE data. One hundred five
were subsequently excluded because of self-reported neurologic
diagnosis (multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, etc). To preclude
the influence of sibling clusters, only the first enrolled sibling
from a family was included, excluding 277 individuals. Five
participants were excluded because of missing covariate data.
Thus, 1,023 individuals were included in the study. This sample
is enriched for AD risk, with 64.2% of participants having at least
one parent with AD as defined by National Institute of Neuro-
logical and Communicative Diseases and Stroke/Alzheimer’s
Disease and Related Disorders Association research criteria and
38.0% being APOE e4 positive. Table 1 gives participant
characteristics.
DNA collection, genotyping, and quality assurance. DNA
was extracted from whole-blood samples with the PUREGENE
DNA Isolation Kit (Gentra Systems, Inc, Minneapolis, MN).
DNA concentrations were quantified with ultraviolet spectro-
photometry (DU 530 Spectrophotometer; Beckman Coulter,
Fullerton, CA). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for
BDNF (rs6265) and APOE (rs429358, rs7412) were genotyped
by LGC Genomics (Beverly, MA) using competitive allele-
specific PCR-based KASP genotyping assays. For quality assur-
ance, duplicate quality control samples from 102 individuals were

The analyses reported here were adjusted for age at baseline, sex, years of education, parental history of Alzheimer disease, APOE
e4 allele carriage, BDNF, and time in years from baseline visit.
BDNF denotes the estimated mean difference in cognition between Val/Val homozygotes and Met carriers at baseline; time
indicates the estimated annual rate of change in cognition for Val/Val homozygotes; and BDNF 3 time indicates the
estimated difference in annual rate of change in cognition between Val/Val homozygotes and Met carriers (this estimate
has to be added to the estimate for time to determine the estimated annual rate of change for Met carriers).
For each cognitive factor, given a significant BDNF 3 time term, follow-up analyses were conducted to elucidate which
component tests of the factor drove the observed associations. Results of the component test analyses are listed under
their respective cognitive factor when applicable.

Cognitive evaluation. The WRAP neuropsychological test
battery24 comprises measures that assess multiple cognitive do-
mains. Prior factor analyses of these measures indicated they map
onto 6 cognitive factors; details of this method have been pre-
viously described.26 Four of these factor scores were included in
the present study because of their representation of cognitive
abilities implicated in AD.27 These factors and their constituent
tests are as follows: immediate memory—Rey Auditory Verbal
Learning Test (RAVLT) Learning Trials 1 and 2; verbal learning
and memory—RAVLT Learning Trials 3 through 5 and Delayed
Recall; working memory—Digit Span and Letter-Number
Sequencing subtests from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence
Scale, third edition; and speed and flexibility—Stroop Color-
Word Test Interference Trial and Trail-Making Tests A and B.
Participants undergo cognitive evaluation at each study visit, with
up to 5 visits completed and a maximum of 13.12 years of follow-
up at the time of these analyses (table 1).
11C-Pittsburgh compound B-PET neuroimaging protocol.
A subset of participants (n 5 140) underwent 3-dimensional
11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET scanning on a Siemens
EXACT HR1 scanner (Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany)
through participation in a WRAP-affiliated study. Detailed
methods of the acquisition and postprocessing of PiB-PET data
have been described previously.4 Briefly, imaging entailed a 70-
minute dynamic scan on bolus injection and a 6-minute trans-
mission scan. Image postprocessing used an in-house automated
pipeline.28 We created distribution volume ratio (DVR) maps of
11C-PiB binding using the time-activity curve in the gray matter of
the cerebellum as a reference region.29 Then, using an anatomic
atlas,30 we extracted quantitative DVR data from 8 bilateral re-
gions of interest sensitive to Ab accumulation, including the
precuneus, posterior cingulate, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cin-
gulate, angular gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, middle temporal
gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus. DVR data from these regions
of interest were combined to form a continuous, composite
measure of Ab accumulation.31 The mean time interval between
PiB-PET scan and baseline WRAP visit was 6.08 6 1.68 years
(table 1).
Statistical analyses. We used linear mixed models to investigate
differences in the 4 cognitive trajectories as a function of BDNF
Val66Met polymorphism. Models were fit by use of the maxi-
mum likelihood estimation and were constructed in the following
progressive steps (assuming normality in the random effects):
random intercept only, random intercept and random slope
(for time, measured in years since baseline visit) without correla-
tion between the 2 (i.e., variance components covariance matrix),
and random intercept and slope with correlation between the 2 (i.
e., unstructured covariance matrix). The last was selected for all
subsequent analyses on the basis of superior model fit (Akaike
information criterion). After the covariance structure was decided,
we then added fixed-effects covariates, which were determined
a priori from known associations with cognition or AD. They
included age at baseline visit, sex, years of education, APOE e4
status (0 5 no e4 allele, 1 5 1 or 2 e4 alleles), parental family
history of AD (0 5 negative parental history, 1 5 positive parental
history), time, and BDNF (0 5 Val/Val homozygotes, 1 5
Met carriers; table 1). Our term of interest was BDNF 3 time
because it would indicate whether rates of decline in cognition
across time differ between BDNF Val/Val and Met carriers. Pri-
mary analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons with a false
discovery rate correction.32 In addition, raw data visualization of
each primary analysis confirmed that linearity was a reasonable
representation of the data (figure e-1 at Neurology.org).
Given a significant BDNF 3 time term, follow-up analyses
were conducted to elucidate which cognitive tests contributing to
the factor scores drove the observed associations. We fitted the
same mixed-effects models as above, except outcomes were the
individual cognitive test scores rather than factor scores. Our term
of interest remained the BDNF 3 time interaction.
In addition, we performed secondary mixed-effects models to
determine whether Ab burden, as indexed by the continuous
composite PiB-PET measure, modified any BDNF 3 time effect
observed in our primary analyses. For this purpose, we incorpo-
rated terms for Ab, BDNF 3 Ab, Ab 3 time, and Ab 3 BDNF 3
time into our original models, with Ab 3 BDNF 3 time being the
term of interest. All follow-up analyses to our primary analyses
were not corrected for multiple comparisons because of their
exploratory nature. Unless specified above, SPSS default mixed-
model specifications were used for all analyses. Details on mixed-
modeling procedures and assumptions are described elsewhere.33
Only findings with values of p # 0.05 (2-tailed) were considered
significant. Analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS, version
21.0.
RESULTS Background
characteristics.
Participant
background characteristics are described in table 1.
The mean 6 SD age at baseline was 54.94 6 6.41
years; women made up 69.7% of the sample. The
group was highly educated (mean 6 SD education
16.36 6 2.82 years) and primarily white (88.7%,
self-reported). In our sample, BDNF Met carriers
encompassed 32.3% of the sample, which is lower
than the reported white population frequency of
37.0% (http://www.alzgene.org). In a comparison of
BDNF Val/Val homozygotes and BDNF Met carriers,
there were no differences in demographic character-
istics except for race/ethnicity (p , 0.001). There
were no differences in demographic characteristics in
the subset of 140 individuals with PiB-PET data.
Influence of BDNF on cognitive trajectories. Results of
the linear mixed-effects models showed a BDNF 3
time interaction in the cognitive domains of verbal
learning and memory (p 5 0.002) and speed and
flexibility (p 5 0.017) such that BDNF Met carriers
declined more steeply over time compared with
BDNF Val/Val homozygotes (table 2 and figure 1).
Differences in cognitive trajectories between Met
carriers and Val/Val homozygotes were not seen in
the cognitive domains of working memory (p 5
0.590) and immediate memory (p 5 0.931; table 2
and figure 1). Because of the difference in race/eth-
nicity between BDNF Met carriers and Val/Val ho-
mozygotes (table 1), we repeated the analyses while
additionally including race/ethnicity as a covariate.
Results were substantively unchanged.
Follow-up analyses were conducted to determine
which cognitive tests in verbal learning and memory

 and speed and flexibility drove the associations noted
above. For verbal learning and memory, both meas-
ures, RAVLT Learning Trials 3 through 5 and De-
layed Recall, showed associations wherein BDNF
Met carriers declined more steeply over time com-
pared with BDNF Val/Val homozygotes (p 5 0.005
and 0.007, respectively; table 2). For speed and flex-
ibility, none of the 3 constituent tests showed associ-
ations with BDNF.
Influence of Ab and BDNF on cognitive trajectories.
Given the BDNF 3 time interactions observed in
verbal learning and memory and speed and flexibility
in our primary analyses, we performed secondary anal-
yses investigating whether the relationships observed
were modified by Ab burden. Results showed that
there was an Ab 3 BDNF 3 time interaction
for verbal learning and memory (b [SE] 5 20.218
[0.101], t 5 22.164, p 5 0.033) but not for speed
and flexibility (b [SE] 5 20.007 [0.086], t 5
20.078, p 5 0.938). When race/ethnicity also was
included as a covariate, results remained substantively
unchanged. A frequency distribution of DVRs is de-
picted in figure 2, with previously determined Ab
positivity cut points indicated.34,35 Figure 3 depicts
the change trajectories in verbal learning and memory,
while accounting for covariates, across the following 4
prototypical groups: Val/Val Ab1, Met carrier Ab1,
Val/Val Ab2, and Met carrier Ab2. Although Ab
burden, indexed with the PiB-PET composite DVR,
was included in the analysis as a continuous variable,
for graphing purposes, we chose 2 anchor points,
the minimum (1.002) and maximum (2.073) DVR
values, to represent Ab1 vs Ab2. As depicted in
figure 3, Ab1 Met carriers showed steeper cognitive
decline over time compared with Ab1 Val/Val ho-
mozygotes, who exhibited normal cognitive perfor-
mance over time. These results indicate that the
adverse influence of Met carriage on cognitive trajec-
tory is further exacerbated by Ab burden, whereas
Val/Val genotype protects cognitive function even in
the context of coexisting Ab burden.
Of note, refitting our original BDNF 3 time anal-
yses within this PiB subsample did not yield

 significant results, although effects were in the same
direction as in the full sample (verbal learning and
memory: b [SE] 5 20.023 [0.017], t 5 21.330,
p 5 0.186; speed and flexibility: b [SE] 5 20.006
[0.015], t 5 20.390, p 5 0.697).
Exploratory analyses. An “additive” genetic model (i.e.,
in which Val/Val 5 0, Val/Met 5 1, and Met/Met 5
2, as opposed to our original “dominant” genetic
model, in which Val/Val 5 0, Met carriers 5 1)
was also considered for the cognitive analyses. Results
from this additive model were similar to results of the
original model, with Met/Met homozygotes exhibit-
ing the steepest cognitive decline. However, because
of the limited number of Met/Met homozygotes (n 5
34), these results may have poor stability.
In addition, we examined whether APOE e4 status
moderated the relationship between BDNF and cog-
nitive trajectories in verbal learning and memory and
speed and flexibility. The findings were nonsignifi-
cant (p 5 0.359 and 0.686, respectively).
DISCUSSION This study found that the BDNF
Val66Met polymorphism is associated with cognitive
decline in a large cohort of individuals with increased
risk for AD. Specifically, compared with Val/Val ho-
mozygotes, Met carriers exhibited steeper decline in
the cognitive domains of verbal learning and memory
and speed and flexibility. In addition, we showed that
Ab accumulation adversely moderated the relation-
ship between BDNF and verbal learning and memory
such that Met carriers with greater Ab burden had
steeper memory decline compared to those with lesser
Ab burden. This is one of few longitudinal studies to
report the association between the BDNF Val66Met
polymorphism and cognitive decline over time. Our
study also expands on previous findings regarding the
moderating relationship between Ab accumulation
and Met carriership on cognitive decline.16 Our
research was conducted in a cognitively healthy
cohort with risk factors for AD, highlighting the
potential for early detection of cognitive decline and
subsequent implementation of interventional thera-
pies36 during this preclinical AD phase.
Our study adds longitudinal evidence to a growing
body of literature on the relationship between the
BDNF
Val66Met
polymorphism
and
cognitive
health. Initial cross-sectional studies on this polymor-
phism found that in younger adults, Met carriership
was associated with worse episodic memory as mea-
sured by the Wechsler Memory Scale and an fMRI
declarative memory paradigm.14,19 More recently,
a study in an aging population18 (mean age 56 years)
demonstrated cross-sectionally that Met carriers per-
formed worse in both item memory and prospective
memory with advancing age compared with Val/Val
homozygotes. Item memory was assessed with the
California Verbal Learning Test,18 a psychometric
measure similar to the RAVLT, which comprises our
verbal learning and memory measure. Another cross-
sectional study17 showed that in addition to memory,
processing speed was reduced in Met carriers compared
Figure 3
Ab modifies BDNF-related trajectories of change in memory
Shown are estimated trajectories of change in the verbal learning and memory cognitive fac-
tor when both the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and Ab positivity as measured by PiB-PET
imaging are examined. This analysis was adjusted for age at baseline, sex, years of educa-
tion, parental history of Alzheimer disease, APOE e4 allele carriage, BDNF, Ab, and time in
years from baseline visit. Trajectories were plotted by calculating the regression equation
lines for the 4 groups (Val/Val Ab1, Met carrier Ab1, Val/Val Ab2, and Met carrier Ab2)
using the mean values for each of the covariates. Although Ab burden, as indexed with PiB-
PET composite DVR, was included in the analysis as a continuous variable, for ease of
display, we chose 2 anchor points, the minimum (1.002) and maximum (2.073) DVR values,
to represent Ab1 vs Ab2. Shaded regions represent standard errors. Ab 5 b-amyloid;
BDNF 5 brain-derived neurotrophic factor; DVR 5 distribution volume ratio; Met 5 methionine;
PiB 5 11C-Pittsburgh compound B; Val 5 valine.

 to Val/Val homozygotes (mean age 63 years). Our
study adds evidence to these findings by demonstrating
that in a longitudinal cohort at risk for AD, Met carri-
ership was associated with steeper decline in the do-
mains of verbal learning and memory and speed and
flexibility over an average time period of 7 years.
However, other work examining the relationship
between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and
cognitive health has failed to find a relationship or
has even observed findings that are opposite to the
aforementioned. In one study, Val/Val genotype
occurred with higher frequency in those with AD
compared
to
healthy
controls22;
another
study
showed lower scores on the Frontal Assessment Bat-
tery in Val/Val homozygote patients with mild AD.23
These discrepancies could possibly be explained by
genetic differences between samples (i.e., lack of
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium), differences in disease
stage at the time of analysis (probable AD vs preclin-
ical AD), or cross-sectional design. In fact, in the pres-
ent study, Met carriers performed better at baseline in
the domains of verbal learning and memory (p 5
0.013) and speed and flexibility (p 5 0.002) (table
2) yet declined more steeply over time, emphasizing
the importance of longitudinal design in studies of
BDNF and cognition.
Other studies have failed to find a relationship
between the Val66Met polymorphism and cognitive
outcomes or AD incidence.15,20,21 However, in one
of these studies, the authors reported relationships
between greater BDNF expression in the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex and slower cognitive decline.21
Another group did not find associations with the
polymorphism but noted that greater serum BDNF
levels
resulted
in
reduced
dementia
and
AD
incidence.20 Finally, a third report did not find asso-
ciations with the Val66Met polymorphism but did
with other BDNF SNPs, specifically rs1157659,
rs11030094, and rs11030108.15 These discrepancies
underscore the need for further understanding of
the intricacies in the relationship between BDNF
polymorphisms, BDNF expression, and cognitive
function.
We found that greater Ab accumulation, as mea-
sured by PiB load in 8 bilateral regions of interest,
moderated the relationship between BDNF and ver-
bal learning and memory such that in Met carriers,
those with greater Ab accumulation had steeper cog-
nitive decline. This finding aligns with a similar
report16 that found that in cognitively healthy older
adults (mean age 71 years), Met carriers with high
levels of Ab exhibited steeper cognitive decline in
episodic memory, executive function, and language
over 36 months. The same group also observed that
among persons with amnestic mild cognitive impair-
ment, Met carriers with high levels of Ab had worse
episodic memory.37 Other groups have noted similar
moderating effects of Ab and BDNF on cognition in
older adults.38
This interaction between Ab and the BDNF
Val66Met polymorphism adds further support for
the potential role the BDNF protein has in moderat-
ing Ab production, thus protecting cognitive func-
tion. Animal studies have indicated that BDNF
regulates sorting protein-related receptor with A-type
repeats, a known modulator of Ab precursor protein
trafficking and processing, via extracellular signal-
regulated protein kinase stimulation, suggesting that
BDNF could deter amyloid production.12 Other
studies have found that BDNF delivery rescues mem-
ory impairment in mice injected with Ab1-42,39 pre-
vents
neuronal
loss,11
and
rescues
cells
from
degeneration due to Ab toxicity.13 It is critical for
future studies to further investigate the role that the
BDNF gene and BDNF protein may have in Ab
accumulation because it could be a potential target
for intervention against Ab toxicity.
A major strength of this study is its scale. With
1,023 individuals and up to 13 years of follow-up,
it is the one of the largest studies investigating the
BDNF Val66Met polymorphism. In addition, con-
ducting the study within the WRAP cohort provides
further evidence that subtle cognitive changes can be
detected early in the AD cascade, and intervention
during this time period could be critical for delaying
or preventing onset of AD. However, this study is not
without limitations. Our sample consists of predom-
inantly highly educated, white individuals, reducing
the generalizability of our results. Generalizability
might also be reduced by the discord between Met
carriers in our sample and the white population fre-
quency. Furthermore, the sample size of individuals
with PiB-PET data was limited. In addition, we were
able to conduct analyses using only one BDNF poly-
morphism, and no serum BDNF data were available
for this research. Ongoing work in our group will
further examine the interplay between BDNF poly-
morphisms, systemic and central BDNF levels, and
neuroimaging and cognitive outcomes. We find this
research to be of particular importance, especially
given the body of research suggesting that BDNF
levels can be increased with physical activity5 and
other modifiable lifestyle factors.40
This study provides evidence that the BDNF
Val66Met polymorphism is associated with cognitive
decline in a large sample of individuals at risk for AD
and that Ab plays a moderating role in this relation-
ship. Our findings suggest that Met carriership could
accelerate cognitive decline throughout the preclinical
phase of AD, emphasizing the importance of investi-
gating BDNF as a potential target for novel AD ther-
apeutics in the future.36
