controversial. Here, Pauthner et al. study
protection from hard-to-neutralize
SHIVBG505 challenge after immunization
with native-like BG505 Envelope trimers
in nonhuman primates and identify
neutralizing antibodies, but not T cell or

SUMMARY
Passive administration of HIV neutralizing anti-
bodies (nAbs) can protect macaques from hard-to-
neutralize (tier 2) chimeric simian-human immunode-
ficiency virus (SHIV) challenge. However, conditions
for nAb-mediated protection after vaccination have
not been established. Here, we selected groups of
6 rhesus macaques with either high or low serum
nAb titers from a total of 78 animals immunized
with recombinant native-like (SOSIP) Env trimers.
Repeat intrarectal challenge with homologous tier 2
SHIVBG505 led to rapid infection in unimmunized
and low-titer animals. High-titer animals, however,
demonstrated protection that was gradually lost as
nAb titers waned over time. An autologous serum
ID50 nAb titer of �1:500 afforded more than 90%
protection from medium-dose SHIV infection. In
contrast, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
and T cell activity did not correlate with protection.
Therefore, Env protein-based vaccination strategies
can protect against hard-to-neutralize SHIV chal-
lenge in rhesus macaques by inducing tier 2 nAbs,
provided
appropriate neutralizing
titers
can be
reached and maintained.

 (Haynes and Burton, 2017; Stephenson et al., 2016). One of
the most intensively
studied approaches is focused on
inducing neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) to the virus. Early
pioneering monkey studies showed that DNA gp120-immuni-
zation induces nAb responses that can protect against tier 1
virus challenge (Barnett et al., 2008, 2010; Pal et al., 2006).
However, tier 1 viruses like SHIVBa-L and SHIVSF162-P4 are
easy to neutralize, typically lead to self-limiting infections,
and are not considered representative of circulating viruses
in the HIV pandemic. Two recent studies investigated vac-
cine-induced protection from a mixed tier SIVsmE660 swarm
and attribute protection, in part, to nAb and other Ab re-
sponses (Keele et al., 2017; Roederer et al., 2014). Currently
there is no clear evidence of vaccination-induced nAbs
providing
protection
against
viruses
possessing
hard-to-
neutralize clinically relevant tier 2 HIV Env in humans or
non human primate (NHP) models.
Enthusiasm for the nAb approach arises from the associa-
tion of nAbs with protection for other viruses (Tomaras and
Plotkin, 2017) and the demonstration that passively adminis-
tered HIV-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can
afford protection in monkey and mouse models of HIV infec-
tion (reviewed in Hessell et al., 2018). As HIV does not infect
monkeys, HIV-neutralizing mAbs are assessed by their ability
to protect against chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency
virus (SHIV) challenge in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta).
However, a major problem in establishing vaccine-induced
nAb protection in the SHIV-macaque model has been the
notorious difficulty in inducing nAbs by immunization. Indeed,
induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) via immu-
nization has thus far been achieved reproducibly only in cows
(Sok et al., 2017). However, we recently showed reliable in-
duction of autologous strain-specific nAbs in macaques
against a hard-to-neutralize tier 2 HIV isolate through the
use of well-ordered and stabilized HIV envelope glycoprotein
(Env) SOSIP trimers as immunogens in optimized approaches
(Pauthner et al., 2017), building on previous SOSIP immuniza-
tion studies in NHPs (Havenar-Daughton et al., 2016; Sanders
et al., 2015; Torrents de la Pen
˜ a et al., 2017). To carry out a
protection experiment in macaques then requires construc-
tion of a SHIV with the same Env sequence as the immu-
nizing trimer. Fortunately, it has recently become possible
to reliably generate infectious SHIVs using env sequences
from most primary tier 2 HIV strains (Del Prete et al., 2017;
Li et al., 2016).
Taking advantage of the advances in both trimer-based
immunization strategies and SHIV generation, we immunized
macaques with SOSIP trimers of the BG505 env sequence (de
Taeye et al., 2015; Kulp et al., 2017; Torrents de la Pen
˜ a et al.,
2017), induced BG505-specific tier 2 nAbs, and then challenged
animals intrarectally with the neutralization-resistant, patho-
genic SHIVBG505 (Li et al., 2016). We found that protection
was critically dependent on the level of serum nAb titers, but
not on other antibody parameters such as V3 binding titers,
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), or the induc-
tion of T cell activity. We determined an approximate titer
threshold for vaccine-induced protection that establishes an
experimental benchmark for comparison with nAb-based vac-
cines to HIV-1.
RESULTS
Immunized Macaques Were Grouped into High and Low
nAb-Titer Animals
Our goal was to assess the capability of vaccine-elicited tier 2
nAbs to protect from homologous tier 2 challenge with neutrali-
zation-resistant, pathogenic SHIVBG505 (Li et al., 2016). We pre-
viously developed a protocol for the reliable induction of nAbs
and immunized 78 NHPs (Pauthner et al., 2017), inducing varying
levels of autologous tier 2 nAb titers after three immunizations
with native-like BG505 Env trimers (de Taeye et al., 2015; Kulp
et al., 2017; Torrents de la Pen
˜ a et al., 2017). To design a
challenge study powered to detect differences between NHPs
with either high or low BG505 nAb titers, we selected six NHPs
that were among the top neutralizers and carefully matched
them as closely as possible, in terms of gender, age, and
weight, with six low nAb titer animals that received similar or
identical immunogens (Figure S1). We note that none of the
protective or viral breakthrough or antibody kinetic effects
described below could be associated with a particular immu-
nogen; as will be seen, observed effects are primarily associated
with nAb titer. We further enrolled 12 unimmunized control ani-
mals into the study. All animals were genotyped for Mamu and
TRIM-5a alleles associated with host restriction in non human
primates (Table S1).
High and Low nAb Titer Groups Have Significantly
Different Serum nAb Titers after a Final Booster
Immunization
To identify a challenge dose that reliably infects unimmunized
control animals, we performed a pilot study by intrarectally (IR)
inoculating two groups of six macaques at weekly intervals
with either 0.5 3 108 or 1.4 3 107 virions of the SHIVBG505
S375Y challenge virus grown in rhesus CD4+ T cells (Figure S2).
For the main study, we selected a challenge dose of 1.4 3 107
virions (1 mL of 1:75 diluted challenge stock), as it infected at
least 4/6 animals after the first challenge and the remaining 2 an-
imals after the second challenge in the pilot study. To maximize
nAb titer levels in NHPs prior to challenge, high and low nAb titer
animals each received a fourth immunization with the previously
used immunogens, adjuvanted in a soluble ISCOMs-class
saponin (Figure 1A). All NHPs responded with increased
autologous nAb titers 2 weeks post-boost. High and low nAb titer
animals continued to show significantly different geometric
mean ID50 titers of 1:3,790 and 1:103 to BG505 S375Y pseudo-
virus (p = 0.002, Figure 1B), respectively. Neutralization titers to
rhesus CD4+ T cell grown SHIVBG505 S375Y challenge stock
were �30-fold lower, with significantly different geometric
mean titers of 1:102 and < 1:10 when tested on TZM-bl target
cells (p = 0.002, Figure 1C), respectively.
High nAb Titer Group NHPs Were Robustly Protected
from Tier 2 SHIV Infection
Four weeks after the booster immunization, all animals received
six weekly IR challenges with SHIVBG505. To maximize compara-
bility, viral loads for all animals and time points were simulta-
neously measured at weeks 6 and 20 (Figures 2A–2C). Five out
of six concurrent unimmunized control animals were infected af-
ter the first challenge and the remaining animal became viremic
242
Immunity 50, 241–252, January 15, 2019
 after the second challenge (Figure 2A). Combined with the unim-
munized control NHPs of the dose-matched titration group (Fig-
ure S2), at least 9 of 12 unimmunized animals became infected
after a single challenge, which approximates to an animal infec-
tious dose of 75% (AID75) (Table S2). Thus, the dose of 1.4 3 107
SHIVBG505 virions per IR inoculation employed in this study set a
relatively high bar for protection. Unimmunized control animals
showed high peak viremia (geometric mean of 5.5 3 106
copies/mL) and consistent set point viral loads in the range of
9.8 3 102 to 4.7 3 104 (geometric mean of 6.2 3 103) at 12 weeks
post-infection (Figures 2A, 2E, and S2).
Two out of six low nAb titer animals became infected after the
first challenge and the remaining four animals became viremic
after the second challenge (Figure 2B), indicating that low nAb
titer animals had a possible mild reduction in per-exposure risk
compared to unimmunized controls, but the difference was not
significant (Figure 2D, Table S3). However, low nAb titer animals
had significantly lowered peak viral loads compared to unimmu-
nized controls (1.5 3 105 versus 5.5 3 106 copies/mL) (p = 0.001;
Figures 2E and 2F).
In contrast, high nAb titer animals showed significant protec-
tion from challenge after the first set of challenges at week 8 (Fig-
ure 2D, Table S3). Except for macaque 12-143, no animals
showed viremia at week 6 and were therefore scheduled to
receive a second set of six challenges starting at week 11. The
goal of the second challenge set was to assess the duration of
protection and to estimate a protective nAb titer threshold
as nAb titers declined over time. Over the course of both chal-
lenge sets, four initially high nAb titer animals became viremic,
after 3, 6, 10, and 12 virus inoculations; however, two animals
showed complete sterilizing protection (Figure 2C). In addition,
infected high-titer macaques showed significantly lowered
peak viremia compared to unimmunized controls (3.2 3 104
versus 5.5 3 106 copies/mL; p = 0.01; Figures 2E and 2F), similar
to the low nAb titer animals. We theorize that sub-protective
levels of serum nAbs at the time of infection, as well as activation
of vaccine-induced memory B cells leading to the rapid produc-
tion of Abs, likely curtail emerging primary viremia, thus reducing
peak viral loads.
The protection from infection for high nAb titer animals
compared to unimmunized controls after both 6 and 12 chal-
lenges was significant (p < 0.0001; Figure 2D, Table S3) and
animals in this group remained uninfected for a median of 11
challenges (Table S3). It should be emphasized that, for all vacci-
nated animals, nAb titers declined throughout the challenge
schedule, unless animals became infected as detailed below.
In this respect, our study distinguishes itself from those in which
antibody titers leveled off prior to challenge, as a result of the
short 4-week interval here between final immunization and first
challenge. However, we deliberately took advantage of declining
nAb titers to determine a nAb-mediated threshold of protection.
In summary, high nAb titer animals showed protection over the
course of multiple challenges, while low nAb titer and unimmu-
nized animals became rapidly infected.
Tier 2 nAb Titers Correlate with Protection
Unimmunized control animals developed BG505 S375Y pseu-
dovirus ID50 nAb titers 8–12 weeks after infection in response
to SHIVBG505 S375Y infection (Figure 3A). By comparison, vac-
cine-induced nAb titers in low titer animals initially declined,
but then began to rise only 1–2 weeks after infection, i.e.,
much more rapidly than in unimmunized animals (Figure 3B).
The early rise of nAb titers after infection of low nAb titer animals
is thus likely due to recall responses of BG505 Env immunogen-
induced memory B cells. Interestingly, BG505 nAb titers rose
to substantially higher ID50 titers (3/6 animals > 1:750) than

 previously achieved by four immunizations of these six animals
with ISCOMs-adjuvanted BG505 native-like Env trimers (Figures
1B, 3B, and S1B). The marked increases in BG505 nAb titers
after infection suggest that outbred macaques that did not
respond well to vaccination were not inherently incapable, by ge-
netic or other means, of developing high nAb titer responses,
although this conclusion should be caveated by the observation
that antigen dose and delivery vary greatly between vaccination
and natural infection. Better immunogen presentation and more
targeted adjuvants are likely needed to increase the reliability of

(Havenar-
Daughton et al., 2017).
High nAb titer animals that became in-
fected showed a comparable increase in
BG505 S375Y nAb titers �1–4 weeks af-
ter infection. The only exception was an-
imal 12-137, who suppressed viremia
for 3 weeks after challenge at week 5
and thus delayed a surge in nAb titers un-
til week 11 (Figure 3C). Animal 12-143,
which became viremic at week 3, showed
only a small rise in nAb titers at week 6,
suggesting possible rapid viral escape.
PacBio sequencing of viral species in
12-143 plasma at week 8 in fact revealed
that >95% of sequenced env genomes
contained putative escape mutations at
residues 168 and 192 (Figure 4A). Simi-
larly, env genomes in 12-137 plasma at
weeks 12 and 16 showed putative escape mutations at residues
354 and 356, flanking the N355 glycan, which coincided with
onset of nAb titer decay at week 12 (Figures 4B and 3C). nAb
specificities to the N355 region were observed in BG505 SOSIP
immunized rabbits (Klasse et al., 2018) and were detected in
week 0 plasma of animal 12-137 using electron microscopy-
based serum mapping (Figure 4C; Bianchi et al., 2018). Serum
neutralization assays revealed that the observed viral point mu-
tations in fact confer neutralization resistance to sera from the
respective animals (Figures 4D and 4E). Animals 12M169 and
244
Immunity 50, 241–252, January 15, 2019
 12M088, which become infected at weeks 16 and 14, respec-
tively, exhibited slow declines in vaccine-induced nAb titers
which then rose after infection (Figure 3C). The nAb titers of fully
protected animals 12-046 and 4O9 (Figure 3D) initially declined
and then plateaued at �1:800 around week 10 and remained
stable for the remainder of the study. This trend was mirrored
in longitudinal ELISA EC50 binding titers (Figures S3A and
S3B). Uninfected animals retained robust nAb titer levels more
than 1 year after the final immunization (Figure S3C).
The differences in both BG505 S375Y pseudovirus as well as
SHIVBG505 challenge stock neutralization ID50 titers between
high and low nAb titer animals at week �2 were, as anticipated,
highly significant (Figures 1B and 1C). Peak nAb titers at week �2
accurately predicted the duration of protection, identifying nAb
titers as the primary correlate of protection (p < 0.0001;
Figure 5A). Using the BG505 S375Y pseudovirus assay, a statis-
tically significant difference was found between nAb titers in
immunized animals 7 days prior to onset of viremia and animals
that remained uninfected until week 20 (p = 0.03; Figures 5B
and S4A).
To numerically quantify the relationship between BG505
S375Y pseudovirus nAb titers and likelihood of infection, we
developed a modified Bayesian logistic regression model using
the neutralization and viral load data from all three animal
groups (Figures 5C and S5). The posterior median infection
probability at the limit of nAb titer detection was 77%, agreeing
closely with an estimated animal infectious dose of 75% in un-
immunized controls. A median per-challenge infection probabil-
ity of 50% was attained with ID50 titers of 1:90, which agrees
well with the often-quoted 50% protective ID50 titer of
�1:100, derived from bnAb passive transfer studies (Hessell
et al., 2018; Moldt et al., 2012; Parren et al., 2001; Pegu et al.,
2014; Shingai et al., 2014), although we note that various
different neutralization assays with differing sensitivities were
employed in these studies. To achieve an infection probability
of 10% (or 90% protection), an ID50 titer of 1:476 (CI:
272–991) was required. In agreement with our model, animals
with nAb titers above �1:500 remained protected over all 12
challenges, while animals with nAb titers below 1:200 generally
became infected with only 1–2 challenges. For the rhesus CD4+
T cell grown SHIVBG505 S375Y virus stock, an ID50 titer of
�1:30 (Figure S4B) was the protection threshold. The observed
disparity
between
pseudovirus
and
PBMC-grown
virus
assays was relatively large compared with that reported for
many mAbs but still within
previously observed ranges
(Figure S4C; Cohen et al., 2018; Provine et al., 2012). Thus,
tier 2 nAb titers both predicted and correlated with protection
from infection.
T Cell Activity and Serum Antibody-Dependent Cell-
Mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC) Do Not Correlate with
Protection
We further investigated other parameters that may have contrib-
uted to protection. Robust Env-specific CD4+ T cell responses
were elicited by BG505 Env trimer immunization and were
equivalent in magnitude between the high and low nAb titer
groups of immunized animals before challenge (Figures 6A,
6E, and S6A–S6C). Cytokine-producing Env-specific CD4+
T cells were also comparable between the two groups of

 immunized animals before challenge (IFN-g+, Figures 6B and 6F;
TNF+CD40L+, Figures 6C, 6G, and S6D) and protein vaccine-eli-
cited Env-specific CD8+ T cells were undetectable, as expected
(Figures 6D and 6H). Thus, Env-specific CD4+ T cells or CD8+
T cells were not a correlate of protection.
Concerns have been raised about vaccine-elicited CD4+ T cell
responses enhancing susceptibility to infection by HIV (Fauci
et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2014) or SIV (Fouts et al., 2015; Staprans
et al., 2004) by providing more targets for infection at the
mucosal site of transmission (Bukh et al., 2014; Carnathan
et al., 2015; Martins and Watkins, 2018; Qureshi et al., 2012),
most likely due to the presence of activated Th1 cells in the mu-
cosa, which was correlated with CCR5, a4b7, or proliferation in
different studies. Minimal Th1 cells were detected in the
BG505 Env trimer immunized animals (IFN-g+CD4+ T cells; Fig-
ures 6B and 6F). CCR5+, Ki67+, or Ki67+/a4b7+ CD4+ T cells in
peripheral blood prior to challenge were not correlated with
susceptibility to infection or protection (Figures S6E–S6H).
Thus, we observed robust protection of high nAb titer animals
against a mucosal SHIV challenge despite substantial levels of
Env-specific vaccine-induced CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood
at 4 weeks after the final immunization. The difference in our
study may be due to a lack of Th1 cells or mucosal homing
CD4+ T cells in response to the protein vaccine, compared to
previously used viral vectors (Bukh et al., 2014; Carnathan
et al., 2015; Fauci et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2014; Staprans et al.,
2004). Alternatively, nAb-mediated protection against HIV/SIV
may more readily overcome possible adverse consequences
of increased numbers of activated CD4+ T cell targets than the
non-neutralizing Abs (nnAbs) raised in the earlier studies.
To investigate possible contributions of ADCC of both nAbs
and nnAbs, we tested animal sera in two infection-based assays:
SHIVBG505-infected CEM.NKR luciferase reporter cells (Fig-
ure 7A; Alpert et al., 2012) and flow cytometric analysis of
ADCC in p27+ SHIVBG505-infected CEM.NKR target cells (Fig-
ure 7B; Veillette et al., 2014). Using either assay, we failed to
detect meaningful ADCC activity at week 0 with the exception
of a single animal, 12-149, which was a low titer animal whose
ADCC activity was non-specific and included activity against
control SIVmac239 (Figure S7A). The absence of observed
ADCC activity can be partially explained by the tier 2 character
of BG505 Env. In native Env trimer-based ADCC assays, nnAb
and tier 1 nAbs fail to mediate ADCC activity against hard-to-
neutralize tier 2 HIV isolates, as previously reported (von Bredow
et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2015). In addition, ADCC activation in
infection-based assays varies strongly depending on the tar-
geted epitope, which is likely related to the Ab binding stoichiom-
etry to the epitope and the ability to cross-link sparse trimers on
the virion surface (Figures S7B–S7D; von Bredow et al., 2016;
Ding et al., 2015).
Unlike infection-based assays, ADCC killing measured on
CEM.NKR target cells coated with BG505 gp120 was robust

 but did not distinguish between high and low nAb titer animals
and, therefore, was not associated with protection (Figure 7C).
ADCC killing of gp120-coated cells did correlate with BG505
gp120 binding, indicating that gp120-binding antibodies are
sufficient to induce ADCC in this assay (Figure 7D) but
cannot mediate ADCC to native membrane-bound Env on
infected cells. Thus, ADCC unlikely contributes to protection.
We also observed considerable staining of p27� uninfected
bystander T cells by both mAbs and animal sera, which appears
to result from antibody binding to shed gp120 from infected cells
that is captured on CD4 of uninfected cells (Figure S7D; Richard
et al., 2018). Overall, these results suggest caution in the use of
ADCC assays that are either based on recombinant gp120 or
gp140 binding, rather than native Env on virus-infected cells,
or cannot distinguish productively infected from uninfected
bystander cells (Ackerman et al., 2016; Ferrari et al., 2011; Huang
et al., 2016; Johansson et al., 2011; Kristensen et al., 2018). We
note that the results pertain to ADCC; there remains the
possibility that other Fc-mediated effector functions might
contribute to protection.
Lastly, we determined BG505 SOSIP.664 (Figure 7E), V3-
peptide (Figure 7F), and BG505 gp120 binding titers (Figure 7G)
for all groups at week 0 since V3-targeting antibodies (Balasu-
bramanian et al., 2018), and binding antibodies in general have
been associated with anti-viral activities (Excler et al., 2014). No
significant differences between high and low neutralizer ani-
mals were detected. In summary, neither T cell activity nor
ADCC and gp120 antibody binding titers correlated with
protection.
DISCUSSION
Vaccine protection against HIV in humans and against SIV and
SHIV in macaques has been associated with non-neutralizing
antibodies (Barouch et al., 2015; Haynes et al., 2012). Here,
we demonstrated that vaccine-induced tier 2 nAbs, but not
other antibody parameters such as V3 binding titers, anti-
body-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), or induction of
T cell activity, were a correlate of protection from homologous
SHIVBG505 infection in macaques. We employed a challenge
dose of virus corresponding to an AID75, which set a relatively
high bar for protection, given that most animals (�53%) in the
control arm were estimated to have been productively infected
by two or more viruses (Table S2). Similar rates of multivariant
virus transmission have been reported in men who have sex
with men and injection drug users who acquire HIV-1 infection
(38% and 60% with a MOI of 2 or higher, respectively), while
heterosexual cohorts show lower multivariant transmission fre-
quencies (�19%). Thus, our model mimics the conditions of
productive transmission events, underlining the physiological
relevance of the challenge dose that we used (Bar et al.,
2010; Li et al., 2010).
We showed, in the model system described, that animals
remain protected from SHIV infection in a nAb titer-dependent
manner, which suggests a strong relationship between circu-
lating nAb titers in the blood and protection from mucosal
challenge with difficult-to-neutralize, tier 2 SHIVBG505. At the
same time, our data suggest that vaccine protection can
occur in the absence of ADCC. We showed that unprotected
animals have relatively high levels of ADCC when measured
in a widely used ADCC assay that uses target cells coated
with monomeric gp120, but not with SHIVBG505-infected target
cells. We further provided evidence that adjuvanted protein im-
munization with HIV Env can induce nAb titers that are durable
and protective over longer periods of time, if high initial nAb
titers after immunization can be reached. This has been a
major concern in the HIV vaccine field (Sundling et al., 2013),
but also for other protein-based vaccines, such as recombinant

using a modified Bayesian logistic regression model (see Figure S5). The posterior median infection probability at the limit of nAb titer detection was 77%,
corresponding to an AID77. A median infection probability of 50% is attained with an ID50 titer of 1:90 (red line, CI: 34-178), and an infection probability of 10% with
an ID50 titer of 1:476 (blue line, CI: 272-991).

 influenza vaccines (Krammer and Palese, 2015). Importantly,
we identified that a serum ID50 nAb titer of �1:500 against
the homologous BG505 S375Y pseudovirus at the time of
challenge can confer reliable protection of >90%, meaning
that 9 of 10 challenges with a physiologically relevant AID75
dose would not result in infection. Finally, protection was
observed for polyclonal neutralizing Ab responses that, as
above and earlier (Pauthner et al., 2017), target multiple spec-
ificities on Env and not simply the previously described glycan
hole on BG505 Env (McCoy et al., 2016).
In conclusion, we provide evidence that protein immuniza-
tion with native-like Env trimers can induce potent and protec-
tive nAb titers in the SHIV/macaque model. Thus, nAb-medi-
ated protection from tier 2 virus challenge is not limited to
bnAbs, which are generally focused to a single site of vulner-
ability and have a defined effector-function profile, but can
also be accomplished by polyclonal autologous nAb re-
sponses of sufficient magnitude and specificity. The latter,
by comparison, comprise a broad range of neutralizing and
non-neutralizing antibody lineages to various, often overlap-
ping epitopes that interact both synergistically and competi-
tively (Klasse et al., 2018; Pauthner et al., 2017; Sanders
et al., 2015; Torrents de la Pen
˜ a et al., 2018). The protective
nAb titer threshold against the homologous challenge virus
that we determined is in rough accord with passive antibody
transfer studies and provides a benchmark for comparison
with upcoming antibody protection studies against HIV in
humans (http://ampstudy.org).

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Outbred Indian rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were sourced and housed at Alphagenesis Inc, Yemasee, SC and maintained in
accordance with NIH guidelines. These studies were approved by the appropriate Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees
(IACUC). None of the NHPs were previously enrolled in other studies that are not explicity stated in the manuscript. All animals
were genotyped for class I alleles Mamu-A*01, Mamu-B*08 and Mamu-B*17 and Trim5, which are associated with spontaneous viro-
logical control. Genotype and gender information for all animals is reported in Table S1. Additional information on high and low nAb
titer group animals is published in Pauthner et al. (2017).
METHOD DETAILS
Rhesus monkey immunizations and challenge
Animals were immunized at 4 weeks before challenge (week �4) with this fourth immunization for a given animal being identical with
that previously administered to that animal (Figure S1B) (Pauthner et al., 2017). The adjuvant used for this boost was a soluble
ISCOMs-class saponin comprised of self-assembled cholesterol, phospholipid, and Quillaja saponin. Briefly, 10 mg each of choles-
terol (Avanti Polar Lipids 700000) and DPPC (Avanti Polar Lipids 850355) were dissolved separately in 20% MEGA-10 (Sigma D6277)
detergent at a final concentration of 20 mg/ml and 50 mg Quil-A saponin (InvivoGen vac-quil) was dissolved in MilliQ H2O at a final
concentration of 100 mg/ml. Next, DPPC solution was added to cholesterol followed by addition of Quil-A saponin in rapid succes-
sion and the volume was brought up with PBS for a final concentration of 1 mg/ml cholesterol and 2% MEGA-10. The solution was
allowed to equilibrate at 25�C overnight, followed by 5 days of dialysis against PBS using a 10k MWCO membrane. The adjuvant
solution was then filter sterilized using a 0.2 mm Supor syringe filter, and concentrated using 50k MWCO centricon filters. Each adju-
vant batch was finally characterized by negative stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) to
confirm uniform morphology and size. The adjuvant was also validated for low endotoxin contect by Limulus Amebocyte Lystae
assay (Lonza QCL-1000). Final adjuvant concentration was determined by cholesterol quantification (Sigma MAK043).
All immunizations were administered as split doses. Each immunization consisted of two subcutaneous injections of 50 mg of Env
trimer protein + 187.5 units (U) of saponin adjuvant, in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) diluent for a total of 100 mg of Env trimer

 protein + 375 U of a soluble ISCOMs-class saponin adjuvant per immunization per animal. Units of the ISCOMs-like adjuvant were
defined as theoretical micrograms of Quil A in the dose, determined from direct measurements of cholesterol incorporation and infer-
ring Quil A content from the input 5:1 Quil A:cholesterol ratio. Subcutaneous immunizations were given in a volume of 0.5 mL with a
1 inch, 25-gauge needle at the medial inner mid-thigh of each leg. The subcutaneous injection technique consists of making a ‘skin
tent’ and inserting the needle into the subcutaneous space at a 45 angle.
Serum was collected in SST Vaccutainer tubes (BD Biosciences) and processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Multiple aliquots of 0.5 mL were frozen at �80�C. Whole blood was collected in K2 EDTA Vaccutainer tubes (BD Biosciences) for
plasma and PBMC isolation. Multiple aliquots of 0.5 mL of plasma were frozen at �80�C. PBMCs were isolated using Thermo
Scientific Nunc EZFlip Conical Centrifuge Tubes per manufacturer’s instructions. PBMCs were isolated, counted, and re-suspended
at 1 3 107 cells/mL in FBS containing 10% DMSO. Aliquots were subsequently frozen in 1 mL vials using a Mr. Frosty freezing
container (Nalgene, cooling rate of 1�C / minute) and placed in a �80�C freezer. The following day PBMC samples were moved
to storage in a liquid nitrogen freezer tank.
Animals were atraumatically inoculated intrarectally with a 1:75 dilution of rhCD4+ T-cell-grown SHIVBG505 N332 S375Y DCT chal-
lenge stock (Li et al., 2016) in RPMI 1640 (GIBCO), which amounted to 1.4 x107 virions or 2 ng p27. See dataset S1B in Li et al. (Li et al.,
2016) for a complete characterization of the challenge stock with respect to virion content and virion infectivity.
Viral Load Assay
RT-PCR assays were utilized to monitor viral loads, essentially as previously described (Cline et al., 2005). RNA was extracted from
plasma with a QIAcube HT (QIAGEN, Germany) using the Qiacube 96 Cador pathogen HT. The SIV gag gene was utilized as a stan-
dard. RNA standards were generated using the AmpliCap-Max T7 High Yield Message Maker Kit (Cell Script) and purified with RNA
clean and concentrator kit (Zymo Research, CA, USA). RNA quality and concentration was assessed by the BIDMC Molecular Core
Facility. Log dilutions of the RNA standard were included with each RT-PCR assay. Reverse transcription of both standards and sam-
ples was done using Superscript III VILO (Invitrogen). RT-PCRs with primers sGag21, sGag22 and probe sGag23 were run on the
Quantstudio 6 Flex system (Applied Biosystems). Viral loads were calculated as virus particles (VP) per ml. Assay sensitivity was
> 100 copies/ml.

Serum neutralization assays
Replication incompetent HIV pseudovirus was produced by co-transfecting env plasmids with an env-deficient backbone plasmid
(pSG3Denv) in HEK293T cells in a 1:2 ratio, using the X-tremeGENE 9 transfection reagent (Roche). Pseudovirus was harvested af-
ter 48-72 h by sterile-filtration (0.22 mm) of cell culture supernatants, and neutralization was tested by incubating pseudovirus and
serum or mAbs for 1 h at 37�C before transferring them onto TZM-bl cells as previously described (Pauthner et al., 2017).
In brief, supernatant was removed from TZM-bl cells after 48-72 h, cells were then lysed, and luciferase activity was measured
following addition of Bright-Glo (Promega) according to manufacturer’s instructions. For replication competent SHIVBG505 neutrali-
zation, rhCD4+ T-cell-grown SHIVBG505 N332 S375Y challenge stock was used instead in a BSL3 facility with no further modifications.
Neutralization is measured in duplicate wells within each experiment. BG505 nAb titers for group comparisons were measured in
three or more independent experiments that were subsequently averaged. The BG505 pseudovirus time course neutralization data
shown in Figure 3 were generated in single large experiments, to test sera from all time points side-by-side, thus ensuring the highest
nAb titer comparability between time points. Neutralization was tested starting at 1:10 serum dilutions followed by nine serial 3-fold
dilutions to ensure the highest sensitivity and range of detection. Neutralization ID50 titers were calculated using the ‘One site – Fit
logIC50’ regression in Graphpad Prism v7.0. ID50 nAb titers of incomplete neutralization curves that reached at least 50%, but
less than 90% maximal neutralization, were calculated by constraining the regression fit through 0% and 100% neutralization, to
ensure accurate calculation of half-way (50%) nAb titers. All neutralization titers are reported as ID50 titers. All nAb titer data panels
show geometric mean titers with geometric SD. BG505 pseudovirus neutralization was tested using the BG505.W6M.ENV.C2 isolate
(AIDS Reagents Program), carrying the T332N mutation to restore the N332 glycosylation site, as well as other indicated mutations
that were added by site-directed mutagenesis.
Serum binding ELISAs
Microlon 96-well plates (Corning) were coated overnight with streptavidin at 2.5 mg/mL (Thermo Scientific). Plates were then washed
4-5 times with PBS-tween (0.05%) and blocked with PBS + 3% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. If capturing biotinylated BG505
SOSIP.664-Avi or BG505-Avi gp120, proteins were added at 2.5 mg/mL in PBS + 1% BSA for 2 h at room temperature. For V3-peptide
binding assays, no streptavidin was coated and instead BG505 V3-peptide (TRPNNNTRKSIRIGPGQAFYATG) was directly coated to
Microlon 96-well plates at 2.5 mg/mL in PBS overnight. Plates were then washed 4-5 times with PBS-tween (0.05%) and serially
diluted sera in PBS + 1% BSA were then added for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were then washed 4-5 times with PBS-tween

 (0.05%) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was added for 1 h at a 1:1000 dilu-
tion (final concentration 0.33 mg/mL) in PBS + 1% BSA at room temperature. Plates were then washed 4-5 times with PBS-tween
(0.05%) and absorption at 405 nm was measured following addition of phosphatase substrate in alkaline phosphatase buffer. We
calculated half maximal EC50 binding titers using Graphpad Prism v7.0. All ELISA Ab data panels show geometric mean titers
with geometric SD.
ADCC assays
Luciferase-based CEM.NKR SHIV, HIV, SIV infection assay
ADCC activity was measured as previously described (Alpert et al., 2012). CEM.NKR-CCR5-sLTR-Luc cells, which express luciferase
(Luc) upon infection, were infected with either HIV-1 BG505, SHIV BG505 or SIVmac239 by spinoculation in the presence of 40 mg/ml
of polybrene. For HIV-1 BG505 and SHIVBG505 infections, vif-deleted infectious molecular clones were pseudotyped with Vesicular
stomatitis virus G (VSVG). Two days post-infection with VSVG-pseudotyped HIV-1/SHIVBG505 and 4 days post-infection with SIV-
mac239, CEM.NKR-CCR5-sLTR-Luc cells were incubated at a 10:1 effector:target cell ratio either with an NK cell line expressing rhesus
macaque CD16 in the presence of serial dilutions of rhesus macaque sera or an NK cell line expressing human CD16 in the presence
of human monoclonal bnAbs. After an 8-hour incubation, Luc activity was measured using BriteLite luciferase substrate
(PerkinElmer). Uninfected or infected cells incubated with NK cells in the absence of antibody or plasma were used to determine
background and maximal Luc activity, respectively. The dose-dependent loss of Luc activity represents the antibody-dependent
killing of productively infected target cells.
FACS-based CEM.NKR SHIV infection assay
VSVG-pseudotyped SHIVBG505 N332 S375Y virus was produced and titrated as previously described (Veillette et al., 2015). Viruses
were then used to infect CEM.NKR-CCR5-sLTR-Luc cells by spin infection at 800 3 g for 1 h in 96-well plates at 25�C. Measurement
of ADCC using the FACS-based assay was performed at 48h post-infection as previously described (Veillette et al., 2015).
Briefly, infected CEM.NKR-CCR5-sLTR-Luc cells were stained with viability (AquaVivid; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and cellular (cell
proliferation dye eFluor670; eBioscience) markers and used as target cells. Human PBMCs isolated from three different healthy
HIV-uninfected individuals were used as effector cells and were stained with another cellular marker (cell proliferation dye eFluor450;
eBioscience). Effector cells were added at an effector:target cell ratio of 10:1 in 96-well V-bottom plates (Corning, Corning, NY). A
1:250 final dilution of sera or 5 mg/ml of mAbs were added to appropriate wells and cells were incubated for 15 min at room temper-
ature. The plates were subsequently centrifuged for 1 min at 300 x g, and incubated at 37�C, 5% CO2 for 5 to 6 h before being fixed
with a PBS-formaldehyde solution (2% formaldehyde final concentration). Cells were then permeabilized using the Cytofix/Cytoperm
Fixation/Permeabilization Kit (BD Biosciences) and SHIV-infected cells were identified by intracellular staining using Alexa fluor
488-conjugated anti-p27 Abs (clone 2F12). Samples were analyzed on an LSRII cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data analysis was
performed using FlowJo v10.0.7 (Tree Star). The percentage of ADCC was calculated with the following formula: (% of p27+ cells
in Targets plus Effectors) � (% of p27+ cells in Targets plus Effectors plus Abs or sera) / (% of p27+ cells in Targets) by gating on
infected living target cells. Of note, samples were deidentified and tested and analyzed blindly.
FACS-based gp120-coated CEM.NKR ADCC assay
CEM.NKR-CCR5-sLTR-Luc cells were coated with 1mg of recombinant HIV-1BG505 N332 gp120/million cells for 30 min at 37�C.
gp120-coated target cells were used as target cells and were stained with viability (AquaVivid; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and cellular
(cell proliferation dye eFluor670; eBioscience) markers. ADCC was performed as described above with the difference that after
target/effector cells co-incubation, cells were fixed with a PBS-formaldehyde solution (2% formaldehyde final concentration) con-
taining a constant number of flow cytometry particles (5x104/ml) (AccuCount Blank Particles, 5.3 mm; Spherotech, Lake Forest,
IL, USA). These particles are designed to be used as reference particles since their concentration is known, thus allowing to count
the absolute cell number by flow cytometry. A constant number of particles (1x103) were counted during cytometry acquisition in
order to normalize the number of viable targets cells. Each sample was acquired with a LSRII (BD Bioscience, Mississauga, ON, Can-
ada) and data analysis was performed using FlowJo v10.0.7 (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA). The percentage of ADCC was calculated
with the following formula: (relative count of gp120-coated cells in targets plus effectors) - (relative count of gp120-coated cells in
targets plus effectors plus Abs or sera) / (relative count of gp120-coated cells in targets) by gating live target cells (Veillette et al.,
2015). Of note, samples were deidentified and tested and analyzed blindly.
T cell analysis
Frozen aliquots of macaque PBMCs were thawed, washed once with RPMI + 10% FBS (R10), incubated with DNase (100ug/ml,
StemCell Technologies 07900) for 15 minutes at 37C, then washed again and split in half for a CD8+ ICS assay and a CD4+ T cell
Activation Induced Marker (AIM) assay (Reiss et al., 2017).
For the CD8+ T cell ICS assay, the sample was further split into three groups and either left unstimulated (ns), stimulated with
BG505 Env peptides (5 mg/ml), or stimulated with SEB (1 mg/ml) for 2 hours at 37�C. Brefeldin A was then added (2 mg/ml), and
the stimulations incubated for another 4 hours at 37�C. The cells were then stained for 30 minutes at 4�C with the fluorescent anti-
bodies in the Surface Marker Panel below and washed twice with FACS buffer. They were fixed with eBio intranuclear fix/perm kit for
20 minutes, washed once with perm buffer, then stained with the antibodies in the Intranuclear Panel in perm buffer for 30 minutes at
4�C. The samples were then washed with FACS buffer and acquired on a BD LSR Fortessa.

 For the CD4+ T cell AIM assay, the sample was further split into three groups and either left unstimulated (ns) or stimulated with
BG505 Env peptides (5 mg/ml), or stimulated with SEB (100 pg/ml) for 24 hours at 37�C. The cells were then stained for 60 minutes
at 4�C with the fluorescent antibodies in the AIM Surface Marker Panel below, washed with FACS buffer, fixed with 1% formaldehyde
for 10 minutes at 4�C, then washed again before acquisition on a BD LSR Fortessa.

Full length env viral sequencing
Long-read env sequencing
Samples were processed using the full-length Env sequencing protocol developed in (Laird Smith et al., 2016), but with modified
primers and PCR conditions. Briefly, plasma samples were pelleted through a sucrose cushion to enrich for virions, RNA was
extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (part no. 52906; QIAGEN, Valencia, CA), and cDNA generated using the SuperScript
III First Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (part no. 18080-051; Thermo Fisher, Fremont, CA), with oligo (dT) primers. SHIV env was
amplified from this cDNA using the HIV env forward primer from (Laird Smith et al., 2016) Env-F: GAGCAGAAGACAGTGGCAATGA,
and using a reverse primer designed for this SHIV: CCCTGATTGTATTTCTGTCCCTCAC, both purchased (de-salted) from Integrated
DNA Technologies (San Diego, CA) and diluted to 20 pmol in 0.1X TE buffer before use. PCR was as in (Laird Smith et al., 2016), using
the Advantage 2 PCR reaction mixture (Advantage 2 PCR Kit, catalog no. 639206; Clontech, Mountain View, CA), with the SA Buffer,
but using 42 cycles of 15 s denaturation at 95�C, 30 s annealing at 64�C, and 3 min extension at 68�C. A QIAquick PCR Purification Kit
(part no. 28106; QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) was used to purify PCR products, and Pacific Biosciences library preparation was exactly as
in (Laird Smith et al., 2016), but using the newer P6/C4 chemistry, and with a modified 0.025nM loading concentration, and a 6 hour
movie time. The challenge stock was handled identically but was highly concentrated and thus only 23 PCR cycles were used during
amplification.
PacBio env data processing
An updated version of the Full-Length Env Analyzer (FLEA) (Eren et al., 2017; Laird Smith et al., 2016) pipeline was used to process SIV
PacBio reads. Briefly, PacBio’s CCS2 algorithm was used to reconstruct single molecule Circular Consensus Sequence (CCS) reads,
outputting fastq files. These reads were filtered for length, quality, and for matching an Env reference database (here we included the
known BG505.SHIV challenge sequence) with FLEA’s default parameter settings. FLEA’s error correction and data-summarizing
approach was used, again with default parameters, collapsing near-identical reads and generating high-quality consensus
sequences (HQCSs), along with HQCS frequencies, which are then codon aligned. These HQCS sequences are visualized in a
web browser environment, allowing the exploration of immunotype frequencies, and displaying variants upon the leaf nodes of a
maximum likelihood phylogeny. Variant frequencies in Figures 4A–4B were computed from HQCS sequence frequencies.

 Complex preparation for negative-stain EM
Serum Fab preparation was carried out as previously described (Bianchi et al., 2018). In brief, after buffer exchanging into TBS, up to
�1 mg of total Fab was incubated overnight with 10-15 mg BG505 trimers at RT in �50 mL total volume. Complexes were then purified
via size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using Superose 6 Increase 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) in order to remove unbound Fab.
The flow-through fractions containing the complexes were pooled and concentrated using 100 kDa cutoff centrifugal filters (EMD
Millipore). The final trimer concentration was titrated to 0.04 mg/mL prior to application onto carbon-coated copper grids.
Negative-stain EM
The SEC-purified complexes were applied to glow-discharged, carbon-coated 400-mesh copper grids, followed by pipetting 3 ml of
2% (w/v) uranyl formate stain and blotting, followed by application of another 3 ml of stain for 45–60 s, again followed by blotting.
Stained grids were stored under ambient conditions until ready for imaging. Images were collected via Leginon software using a
Tecnai T12 electron microscopes operated at 120 kV and 52,000x magnification. In all cases, the electron dose was 25 e�/A
˚ 2.
Particles were picked from the raw images using DoG Picker and placed into stacks using Appion software. 2D reference-free align-
ment was performed using iterative MSA/MRA. The particle stacks were then converted from IMAGIC to RELION-formatted MRC
stacks and subjected to RELION 2.1 2D and 3D classification. A detailed protocol can be found in Bianchi et al., Immunity 2018.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Infection probability per challenge event was modeled as depending on the BG505 N332 S375Y log10 ID50 nAb titer at the time of
challenge using a modified logistic regression, where the maximum infection probability (where 0 < max < 1) was an additional param-
eter to be estimated by the model, rather than being fixed at 1 as in traditional logistic regression:
max
1 + e�slope ðx�offsetÞ
This adjustment is necessary because unimmunized animals with no serum nAb titers are not infected with 100% probability upon
the first challenge, as a consequence of the chosen AID75 challenge dose. The infection event was assumed to be the challenge time
point prior to the detection of viremia. Per-time point challenge outcomes were assumed to be conditionally independent of each
other when conditioning on the corresponding BG505 N332 S375Y log10 ID50 nAb titer of the respective time point. We assumed
weakly informative priors over the three model parameters, with slope�Normal(0,10), offset�Normal(0,10), and max�Uniform(0,1),
and we used the Metropolis algorithm to draw 1 million samples from the posterior distribution. Chain mixing was rapid (see trace
plots in Figure S5B), with effective sample sizes (ESSs) above 20,000 for all 3 parameters and for the log posterior probability.
The posterior parameter distributions are visualized in Figure S5A. The calculated 5%, 50%, and 95% quantiles for each parameter
were:
slope: �6.32937, �3.49356, �1.99455
offset: 1.71374, 2.12005, 2.4339
max: 0.602868, 0.80477, 0.962382
While under the prior distribution, P(slope < 0) = 0.5 and P(slope > 0) = 0.5, allowing equal prior probability of protective or sensi-
tizing effects of neutralizing antibodies, the posterior probability of P(slope < 0) = 1 indicated the strongest possible evidence for
decreasing infection probabilities given increasing ID50 nAb titers. Figure S5C shows 10,000 posterior sampled logistic curves,
and the 5%, median, and 95% credible intervals for the infection probability computed from these, that were used to plot Figure 5C.
Graphpad Prism v7.0 was used for all standard statistical analyses. The significance of differences in neutralization and binding
data between groups was calculated using unpaired, two-tailed Mann-Whitney U tests, correlations were calculated using Spearman
correlation tests. Statistical parameters of all analyses are reported in the respective figure legends.
