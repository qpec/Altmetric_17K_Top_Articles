 National Institutes of Health–Funded Cardiac Arrest Research:
A 10-Year Trend Analysis
Ryan A. Coute, BS; Ashish R. Panchal, MD, PhD; Timothy J. Mader, MD; Robert W. Neumar, MD, PhD
Background-—Cardiac arrest (CA) is a leading cause of death in the United States, claiming over 450 000 lives annually. Improving
survival depends on the ability to conduct CA research and on the translation and implementation of research findings into
practice. Our objective was to provide a descriptive analysis of annual National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding for CA research
over the past decade.
Method and Results-—A search within NIH RePORTER for the years 2007 to 2016 was performed using the terms: “cardiac arrest”
or “cardiopulmonary resuscitation” or “heart arrest” or “circulatory arrest” or “pulseless electrical activity” or “ventricular
fibrillation” or “resuscitation.” Grants were reviewed and categorized as CA research (yes/no) using predefined criteria. The annual
NIH funding for CA research, number of individual grants, and principal investigators were tabulated. The total NIH investment in
CA research for 2015 was calculated and compared to those for other leading causes of death within the United States. Interrater
reliability among 3 independent reviewers for fiscal year 2015 was assessed using Fleiss j. The search yielded 2763 NIH-funded
grants, of which 745 (27.0%) were classified as CA research (j=0.86 [95%CI 0.80-0.93]). Total inflation-adjusted NIH funding for
CA research was $35.4 million in 2007, peaked at $76.7 million in 2010, and has decreased to $28.5 million in 2016. Per annual
death, NIH invests �$2200 for stroke, �$2100 for heart disease, and �$91 for CA.
Conclusions-—This analysis demonstrates that the annual NIH investment in CA research is low relative to other leading causes of
death in the United States and has declined over the past decade. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2017;6:e005239. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.

Key Words: cardiac arrest • National Institutes of Health • research funding
C
ardiac arrest (CA) is the third leading cause of death in
the United States,1,2 claiming the lives of over 450 000
individuals annually.3-5 The estimated survival rates of those
treated for in-hospital CA and out-of-hospital CA with any
initial rhythm are �24% and 11%, respectively.3 In order to
improve outcomes for this lethal condition and to decrease
its
burden
on
society,
funding
for
CA
research
and
translation of findings into clinical practice is critical.2,6
Yet, the number of CA randomized controlled trials, a marker
of research and innovation in the field, is low with fewer
than 5 published yearly throughout the world over the past 2
decades.7
Unlike other diseases (eg, stroke and heart failure), CA
research rarely receives external funding from pharmaceutical
or cardiovascular device manufacturers and instead relies
heavily on funding from governmental agencies such as the
National Institutes of Health (NIH).6 The NIH research
portfolio, which provides support details for more than 250
disease areas and is updated annually, includes no data
specific to CA funding.2 Therefore, data on the NIH invest-
ment in CA research and number of funded CA principal
investigators are largely unknown.
In an effort to fill this knowledge gap, we performed a
simple descriptive analysis of NIH-funded CA research over
the past decade. The overall goals were to understand the
trend in CA research funding over time and to compare the
NIH investment in CA research to that of other leading causes
of death in the United States.

 for the years 2007 to 2016 was performed using the following
search term string: “cardiac arrest” or “cardiopulmonary
resuscitation” or “heart arrest” or “circulatory arrest” or
“pulseless electrical activity” or “ventricular fibrillation” or
“resuscitation.” All grants from non-NIH funding sources
including the US Food and Drug Administration, US Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs, and the Agency for Health Care
Research and Quality were excluded from the analysis. Grants
were individually reviewed and categorized as CA research
(yes/no) using predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Grants were classified as CA research if they met any of
the following criteria: (1) studies designed to improve the
treatment/outcomes of prehospital or in-hospital CA; (2) use
of a CA model; (3) use of a global ischemic brain injury model;
(4) study of the mechanism of ventricular fibrillation, pulseless
ventricular tachycardia, pulseless electrical activity, or asys-
tole; (5) study of the mechanism of therapeutic hypothermia
for CA; or (6) funding for resuscitation centers or group
collaborations that list CA research as a specific aim.
Grants were classified as not CA research according to the
following guidelines: (1) study of channelopathies or arrhyth-
mia research other than ventricular fibrillation, pulseless
ventricular tachycardia, pulseless electrical activity, or asys-
tole; (2) cardioplegia research; (3) implantable cardioverter
defibrillator research; (4) trauma unless traumatic arrest is
specifically mentioned; or (5) not CA research.
The data were directly exported from the NIH RePORTER
search to a Microsoft Excel file. The data available included the
grant title, contact principal investigator, investigator affiliation,
award amount, funding agency (ie, National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute, National Institute of Neurological Diseases and
Stroke, etc), award type (ie, newly funded, competing renewal,
and noncompeting renewal grants), and funding mechanism. As
a measure of the CA research pipeline, the number of individual
trainee grants was also tabulated and defined as K awards (K01,
K08, K22, K23, and K99), F awards (F30, F31, and F32), and R
awards (R00). The data used in this analysis include publicly
available grant information from NIH RePORTER and thus did
not require approval by the University of Michigan Institutional
Review Board.
NIH Research Investment for Leading Causes of
Death
Data for the top 10 leading causes of death in the United
States were obtained from the National Center for Health
Statistics 2015 Health Report.9 The annual NIH Categorical
Spending Report is available online and is titled, Estimates of
Funding for Various Research, Conditions, and Disease Cate-
gories.10 NIH research funding data for the leading causes of
death were obtained from the Estimates of Funding for Various
Research, Conditions, and Disease Categories for funding year
2015.10 Estimates for the number of deaths due to CA (both
in-hospital and out-of-hospital CA) were extrapolated from the
AHA Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics—2015 Update.11
From
this
information,
the
NIH
research
investment,
expressed as dollars per annual death, was calculated for
each disease.
Primary Data Analysis
The data were analyzed descriptively. The primary outcome
measure was inflation-adjusted annual funding of CA research
in millions of dollars. Inflation adjustment was performed for
funding years 2007 through 2015 using the consumer price
index inflation calculator provided by the US Bureau of Labor
Statistics.12 Secondary outcome measures included number
of individual principal investigators funded per year (defined
as contact principal investigator), total number of funded
grants per year, and the NIH investment in CA research
(defined as dollars per annual death) compared to other
leading causes of death. For funding year 2015, we estimated
interrater reliability among 3 independent reviewers using
Fleiss j for multiple raters using the MAGREE macro in SAS
(SAS 14.1, 2015; SAS, Cary, NC). The MAGREE macro is
based on methods developed by Fleiss et al.13
Results
The NIH RePORTER database search yielded a total of 2845
grants, 82 of which were excluded due to a non-NIH funding
source. Of the remaining 2763 NIH-funded grants, 745
(27.0%) met study inclusion criteria and were classified as CA
research (Figure 1). Of the total search result, 73% of NIH
grants were excluded from the evaluation. Fleiss j for
interrater reliability was 0.86 (95%CI 0.80-0.93), indicating
good inter-rater agreement.
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• We performed a descriptive analysis of NIH-funded cardiac
arrest research over the past decade.
• The results demonstrate the annual NIH investment in
cardiac arrest research is low relative to other leading
causes of death in the United States, and has declined over
the past decade.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• These results should help inform the debate regarding
optimal funding for cardiac arrest research in the United
States.

 The total CA funding in the index year of 2007 was
$30.5 million (inflation-adjusted $35.4 million), and declined
to $28.5 million in 2016 (Figure 2). Maximum annual funding
during the study period occurred in 2010 ($69.7 million;
inflation-adjusted
$76.7 million),
with
$42.9 million
supporting the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC)
Data Coordinating Center. Of particular note, a decrease of
over $12 million was observed from 2015 to 2016, 80% of
which can be attributed to the cessation of ROC funding. A
nearly 10-fold increase in pediatric CA research was observed
from 2007 ($0.95 million; inflation-adjusted $1.1 million) to
2016 ($9.6 million).
The NIH investment in CA research for the 2015 funding
year ($40.8 million) represents �0.19% of the total NIH
research grant funding for 2015 ($21.2 billion),14 while stroke
and heart disease represent 1.4% and 5.9%, respectively. As
illustrated in Figure 3, the NIH investment per annual death
equates to �$2200 for stroke, �$2100 for heart disease, and
�$91 for CA.
Table presents data on the number of total grants funded,
CA principal investigators, newly funded grants, and trainee
grants by year. From 2007 to 2016, an increase was observed
in the number of pediatric CA grants (from 5 to 17) and
individual trainee CA grants (from 5 to 15). Little to no growth
was observed in the number of funded investigators (from 54
to 60), newly funded grants (from 12 to 17), and overall grants
funded (from 70 to 65).
Discussion
In this evaluation, when adjusted for inflation, the total NIH
funding for CA research in 2016 was nearly 7 million dollars
less than a decade previous in 2007. Although CA is the third
leading cause of death in the United States,1 annual NIH funding
for research to improve outcomes is relatively low. There were
influxes of funding at different times in the decade in support of
the ROC with a large decrease in funding in fiscal year 2016
when ROC funding was discontinued. In 2015 the annual NIH
investment in CA research was $91 per annual US CA death.

 The results of this analysis are consistent with previous
assessments of NIH funding for CA research. Ornato et al
reviewed CA grants funded by the NIH National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute between 1985 and 2009. During this
time
period,
they
noted
257
funded
grants
in
NIH
RePORTER through a primary keyword search of “heart
arrest and resuscitation.”6 They reported a large disparity
from other cardiovascular diseases in the number of funded
projects per 10 000 annual deaths, with myocardial infarc-
tion having 439 grants, stroke with 294 grants, heart failure
with 349 grants, and CA with only 8 funded grants.6 More
recently, an estimate of total CA research funding was
made as part of the Institute of Medicine report using NIH
RePORTER. With the search terms “cardiac arrest” and
“resuscitation science,” NIH grants were identified with an
estimated total funding in 2013 of $107.7 million.2 In both
of these studies the calculated amount of funding was likely
overestimated.2,6 These evaluations used nonspecific search
terms (ie, resuscitation) identifying both CA grants and
those not studying CA. In the current analysis, when strict
inclusion and exclusion criteria were used requiring inspec-
tion of the individual grant descriptions, only 27% of all
grants identified by initial search terms were CA grants.
These grants account for the overall funding of 28.5 million
dollars for CA in 2016.
Our analysis indicates that NIH CA research funding is low
per annual death compared with other leading causes of death
(Figure 3). CA funding as calculated in this evaluation was $91
per death in 2015. This is significantly lower than other leading
causes of death (Figure 3). For example, the investments in
diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, and cancer are �$13 000,
$12 000, and $9000 per annual death, respectively. Another
time-sensitive condition, stroke, has an investment of $2200
per annual death. Using total NIH funding for 2016, assuming
no change in the incidence of CA, we expect the NIH
investment in CA research to further drop to $63 per death.
It is important to note that the number of individual training
grants increased from 5 (7% of all grants) in 2007 to 15 (23%
of all grants) in 2016. Although this suggests a growing
pipeline of early career investigators, it has yet to translate
into an increased number of funded principal investigators or
funded grants. Another area where a steady increase in
funding was noted was grants related to CA in pediatrics. The
number of funded grants that had a pediatric focus increased
steadily over the last decade from 5 (7% of all grants) in 2007
to 17 (26% of all grants) in 2016 (Table).

 Limitations
Our study does not answer important questions about the
cause of relatively low and declining funding for CA research.
Importantly, our results do not include numbers of grant
applications submitted and funding rates. Unfortunately,
these data are not publically available and are not released
by the NIH. The lack of growth in number of principal
investigators funded by NIH to perform CA research does
suggest an inadequate pool of investigators focused on this
disease. Furthermore, we also did not evaluate funding from
other federal sources, foundations, or industry. We focused on
NIH funding because NIH is the primary governmental funder
of biomedical research in the United States. However, there is
no evidence that funding of CA research from other sources is
different for CA compared to other diseases.
NIH funding per annual death may not be the best metric for
CA research funding because it is the final common pathway of
death and overlaps with many other disease states. However, a
similar argument could be made about the overlap between
other leading causes of death such as diabetes mellitus and
heart disease or chronic respiratory disease and pneumonia, all
of which are reported independently by Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention as causes of death. An alternative
approach would be to compare funding per disability-adjusted
life year. However, to our knowledge, a reliable estimate of the
annual disability-adjusted life years lost due to CA in the United
States is currently not available.
Additional limitations include the fact that data were
extracted from the NIH RePORTER software and depend on
the accurate reporting of the grants funded per fiscal year by
the NIH. Data associated with the burden of disease and the
funding associated with each of the leading causes of death
are from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
NIH research portfolios and depend on accuracy of these
reports. The funding for the ROC supported both trauma and
CA research trials. NIH RePORTER does not provide details to
delineate funding specific to CA for ROC grants. With this in
mind, the final estimates of total annual funding may be
overestimated. The inclusion criteria used in this evaluation
were liberal to enable capture of all research associated with
CA. Included in our criteria were global ischemia models and
asphyxia models of CA. We limited our evaluation of interrater
reliability to a single funding year. Although we utilized 3
reviewers in this evaluation, and the interrater reliability
demonstrated good reliability, extraction errors in data
collection are possible.
Conclusion
NIH’s mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the
nature and behavior of living systems and the application of
that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce
illness and disability. This analysis demonstrates that the
annual NIH investment in CA research is low relative to other
leading causes of death in the United States and has declined
over the past decade. Although these results do not elucidate
the cause of this apparent funding disparity, they should
inform the debate regarding optimal funding for CA research
in the United States.
