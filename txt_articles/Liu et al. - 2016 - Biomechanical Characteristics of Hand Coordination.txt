Abstract
Hand coordination can allow humans to have dexterous control with many degrees of free-
dom to perform various tasks in daily living. An important contributing factor to this important
ability is the complex biomechanical architecture of the human hand. However, drawing a
clear functional link between biomechanical architecture and hand coordination is challeng-
ing. It is not understood which biomechanical characteristics are responsible for hand coor-
dination and what specific effect each biomechanical characteristic has. To explore this link,
we first inspected the characteristics of hand coordination during daily tasks through a sta-
tistical analysis of the kinematic data, which were collected from thirty right-handed subjects
during a multitude of grasping tasks. Then, the functional link between biomechanical archi-
tecture and hand coordination was drawn by establishing the clear corresponding causality
between the tendinous connective characteristics of the human hand and the coordinated
characteristics during daily grasping activities. The explicit functional link indicates that the
biomechanical characteristic of tendinous connective architecture between muscles and
articulations is the proper design by the Creator to perform a multitude of daily tasks in a
comfortable way. The clear link between the structure and the function of the human hand
also suggests that the design of a multifunctional robotic hand should be able to better imi-
tate such basic architecture.
Introduction
The human hand is an amazing instrument that can perform a multitude of functions, such as
the power grasp and precision grasp of a vast array of objects. The excellent behaviors of the
human hand are enabled by a highly complex structure, with 19 articulations, 31 muscles and
more than 25 degrees of freedom (DOF) [1]. While the abundant functions are favorable, this

 complex structure also raises a challenging problem of how the human body controls such a
large number of mechanical DOFs with ease and an absence of effort.
Studies indicate that digits do not move alone in isolation of adjacent digits during func-
tional activity [2], even when a specific movement requires an individual digit [3]. On the
contrary, the movements of multiple digits are correlated, and movement information of the
human hand is redundant, so that only a small number of components account for most
variances [4]. The human hand adopts coordinated movements to reduce the number of
independent DOFs and simplify the complexity of the control problem [5,6]. Thus, hand
coordination affords humans the ability to flexibly and comfortably control the complex
structure to perform numerous tasks. Hand coordination should indicate the mystery of the
Creator’s invention.
There are two main factors that contribute to hand coordination: neurological functions
and biomechanical constraints [7]. The neurological functions are controlled by the central
nervous system (CNS) [8]. The CNS receives sensory information, such as smells, tastes,
sounds, sights and tactile information, and responds to the information with an action, which
can move different fingers simultaneously through the spillover of the neural drive to neigh-
boring muscles [9]. Compared to the neurological functions, knowledge of the complex
biomechanical architecture is more crucial to understanding hand coordination because
mechanical functions can affect motor commands [10]. In the human hand, a single muscle
does not always connect a single articular but rather has a unique connective architecture
between muscles and articulations, such as the interconnection of a multi-tendon muscle with
several articulations. Although many researchers have noted the effect of the biomechanical
constraints on hand coordination [1,3,7,10], few have found a clear link between the bio-
mechanical architecture and hand coordination. In this paper, we will explore such a functional
link.
Before establishing the clear link between biomechanical architecture and hand coordina-
tion, we studied the characteristics of the coordinated movement of the human hand during
grasping activities in daily living. As far as we know, considerable attentions have been devoted
to investigating the characteristics of the coordinated relationships between fingers or joints
using a multivariate statistical analysis of the kinematic data, which were collected from sub-
jects during tasks or a period of natural movements [11–16]. However, in most of these studies
the movement data are gathered from only a few grasping types while not covering various
grasp tasks in daily life as much as possible. And the grasping tasks are also different in these
research works. As discussed in this paper, the human hand adopts a distinctive coordinated
control strategy for each task. It is apparent to get different coordinated relationships between
joints from the movement data compiled by different tasks. Considering that the versatile
ability to complete various tasks is a crucial advantage of the human hand, it is necessary to
understand the basic characteristics of coordinated movement needed when various tasks are
performed. Thus, we collected kinematic data from a sufficient number of tasks, which repre-
sented a variety of grasp tasks in daily life as much as possible, to explore the basic coordinated
relationships between joints. In addition, cluster analysis was used to determine a network and
detailed coordinated relationship among joints.
After determining the basic characteristics of coordinated movement, we tried to find clear
corresponding evidence of coordinated relationships from the biomechanical characteristics of
muscular-articular connective architecture and to establish the functional link between the bio-
mechanical architecture and the characteristics of hand coordination. Clear evidence would
indicate that the muscular-articular connective architecture of the human hand is responsible
for the basic dexterous control strategy for various tasks. This study explores a method to

 identify the proper explanation for the hand architecture of muscular-articular connections
from the analysis of behavioral result.
Materials and Methods
Task paradigm
In daily use, grasping is the most common function of the human hand [7]. Many studies have
focused on grasping to mimic the ability for artificial hands [17,18]. The human hand can
grasp different objects of a vast range of sizes and shapes. People are more concerned with the
tasks they wanted to accomplish than the sizes and shapes of objects in terms of the choice of
grasp. This suggests that grasps could be categorized according to tasks instead of appearance
[19]. An early attempt to characterize grasp was made by Napier [20]. He suggested that the
diversity of grasp activities of the human hand could be composed of two basic functional
modes: power grasp and precision grasp. The former is characterized by application of force
with a large contact area between objects and the hand surface. In the latter, the objects are dex-
terously held with the tips of the fingers and thumb. Following Napier, many researchers have
elaborated the two basic categories by proposing further subdivisions [19,21,22]. These subdi-
visions are based on the details of the tasks in terms of which group of fingers exerted force
on the object and which part of the finger contacted the object [4]. Feix incorporated the
grasp taxonomy from existing studies and developed a comprehensive taxonomy [23]. In par-
ticular, he considered the distinctiveness of the thumb and expanded the taxonomy to 33 dif-
ferent task types (as shown in S1 Fig). This finite taxonomy is able to allow a better description
of the capabilities of the human hand. Therefore, the Feix taxonomy was chosen as our task
paradigm.
Subjects
Thirty asymptomatic subjects (15 males and 15 females, 25 years old on average) participated
in the experiment after providing written informed consent. None of the subjects had any
known history of neurological or musculoskeletal problems that might affect their hand func-
tion. They also possessed no particular hand skill as a result of work or leisure activities, such
as being proficient in playing the piano. Each subject was required to fill out a Edinburgh
Inventory questionnaire to quantify their handedness on the laterality quotient scale [24]. A
value of +100 indicated maximally right-handed, and a value of -100 indicated maximally left-
handed. The laterality quotient for these subjects ranged from +68 to +100, and the subjects
were all right-handed. The experimental protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the
Tongji Medical College.
Experimental procedure
Subjects were seated near the edge of a table and placed their right arm on the table in a com-
fortable posture. They were instructed to perform 33 types of tasks (S1 Fig) using a large num-
ber of objects, which were chosen from the most common objects in daily life and had a large
range of sizes and shapes, such as cylinders, disks, spheres and cards. In each type of task, the
subjects were asked to grasp three objects of different sizes or shapes separately, and each test
was repeated on every object three times to depress random error. At the beginning of each
trial, objects were placed beyond the subjects’ suitable reaching distance, and the subjects
extended their right hand in a natural full extension. Upon hearing the “go” command (in Chi-
nese), the subjects started to grasp the object at a self-paced speed. They were allowed to move
the proximal arm in accordance with the hand motion during the experiment.

 An instrumented glove (CyberGlove, Virtual Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with
embedded resistive bend sensors was used to measure the joint angles of the hand during the
grasping movement from the start command to the completion of the task. Before each subject
was tested, the glove sensors were calibrated between sensor output and joint angle by estab-
lishing an approximate linear regression relationship [3,13]. Data from each glove sensor were
sampled at 50 Hz and stored to a disk on a personal computer. As shown in Fig 1A, we
recorded the data from 16 sensors, which consisted of the metacarpal-phalangeal (MCP), prox-
imal inter-phalangeal (PIP) and distal inter-phalangeal (DIP) sensors for the four fingers
(Index: I, Middle: M, Ring: R, Little: L) and the carpometacarpal (CMC), MCP, inter-phalan-
geal (IP) and abduction (ABD) sensors for the thumb (T). The MCP, PIP, and DIP sensors for
the four fingers and the MCP and IP sensors for the thumb were applied to measure the flex-
ion-extension (fe) movement (Fig 1B). It should be noticed that the CMC joint of the thumb is
a compound joint and has two non-orthogonal rotation axes, which are located in different
bones. The adduction-abduction (aa) axis passes through the proximal end of the metacarpal
bone, while the fe axis intersects with the trapezium carpal bone [25]. The non-orthogonal and
non-intersecting axes of the CMC joint made it difficult to measure the joint angles accurately
using the instrument glove. An alternative method for the CyberGlove was to measure the
angle of the thumb rotating across the palm and the angle between the thumb and index
finger using CMC and ABD sensors to replace the two joint angles of the compound joint.
Flexion and abduction were defined as positive, as shown by the rotating direction of the
arrows in Fig 1B.
Data analysis
As mentioned previously, we used the CyberGlove to record the joint angles of the human
hand from the 16 sensors, and each trial discretely sampled from the beginning time to the
movement completion time during each task. A Butterworth filter was used to smooth the digi-
tized sensor data and reduce the noise caused by the acquisition instrument. For each subject,
data from all recording sessions of the kth task were concatenated to form a movement data
Qk 2 <16�nk, where nk represents the sample number of discrete joint angles during the respec-
tive task. All movement data Qk of the 33 types of tasks for a subject were concatenated to cre-
ate the movement dataset Q 2 <16�n during the entire experiment.
Principal components analysis (PCA) was employed to investigate the degree of the coordi-
nated behavior among the joints of the human hand. This dimensional reduction method
transformed the original dataset of correlated joint angle variables into a linear combination of
new, uncorrelated variables called principal components (PCs). The PCs were derived as the
eigenvectors of the covariance matrix computed from the joint angle dataset Q. Then, the PCs
were ordered according to the percentage of variance explained by each component [26]. The
first PC accounted for the greatest variation and gave the best fit to all of the movement data of
the joint angles. The second maximized the variation excluding the first PC, and so on. The
smaller numbers of PCs accounted for most variance, and a higher degree of coordinated
movement existed among joints during the whole experiment of various tasks.
Correlation analysis was used to determine the coordinated relationships between joints. If
two joints were coordinated, they would move synchronously with a certain relationship. The
degree of the movement-coordinated relationship between joints could be described by Pear-
son’s correlation coefficient of the time-varying angular data. However, the absolute value of
Pearson’s correlation coefficient was chosen as the measurement of the movement-coordinated
relationship by ignoring the relative movement direction. We applied correlation analysis on
different movement datasets composed of different tasks. At first, the movement dataset Qk for

 each task was used to determine the coordinated relationships between joints. There were
16×(16–1)/2 = 120 variables of coordinated relationships between joints, and the average value
of all variables was used to denote the general evaluation of the movement coordination. Next,
the movement datasets for multiple tasks were pooled to analyze and obtain the common coor-
dinated relationships for these tasks. To study the influence of richness of task type, different
numbers of task types were chosen to comprise the pooled movement datasets and determine
their respective common coordinated relationships. When choosing m number of tasks from
the 33 tasks in S1 Fig, there were Cm
33 combination possibilities, and it was necessary to equalize
all of the possibilities to give a statistical result. However, it was a time-consuming calculation
to exhaust all possibilities because the number of possible combinations could reach 1.17×109
when 16 types of tasks were chosen. Instead, we randomly selected 2000 types from all possible
combinations except the conditions of choosing one or two types of tasks, which would have
less than 2000 possibilities. Therefore, when choosing m number of tasks, the general evalua-
tion of the coordinated relationship, called the mean movement coordination (MMC), was
defined as

 to obtain the detailed movement-coordinated relationships among the joints of the human
hand. This clustering method started with the individual joint variables, and each joint variable
acted as a separate cluster [27]. The absolute value of the correlation coefficient between every
two joint variables, which described the movement-coordinated relationship, was taken as the
similarity measurement between these clusters. The two most similar clusters were first merged
to create a new cluster. In subsequent steps, the more similar clusters were continuously
merged into a single cluster. The similarity between two clusters should be recalculated at each
step, and the measure was defined as follows using the average linkage algorithm:

where rij is the correlation coefficient between the ith element of cluster U and the jth element

Statistical analyses. To provide a statistical description, we performed significance tests of
our results in the correlation analysis and clustering analysis. In the correlation analysis, a one-
tailed paired t-test was used to test whether the average value of the coordinated relationships
in one task was significantly higher or lower than that in another task. The same test was
employed in the case of comparing the coordinated relationships between different joint pairs.
In the clustering analysis, the values of the movement-coordinated relationships across all sub-
jects were averaged to conduct the cluster analysis by continuous agglomeration of similar clus-
ters. In each agglomerative step, the similarity between clusters was the mean value of all
subjects, and the two clusters with the highest value of similarity were grouped. The results
appeared to indicate that the two clusters were more similar to one another than to other clus-
ters. However, this result of clustering was based on the average value across subjects, and the
two clusters in many subjects might be more similar to other clusters than to one another due
to the individual differences. To test the statistical significance of such clustering results in
every agglomerative step, we used a one-tailed paired t-test to separately test whether the simi-
larity between the two agglomerative clusters was significantly higher than the similarity
between the two clusters with each of the other clusters. The Bonferroni-Holm correction of
the p value was used for multiple comparisons of the similarities [28], and the highest corrected
p value was taken as the significance of each agglomerative result. The probability level of
p<0.05 was chosen as statistical significance for each test.
Results
Degree of coordinated movement among joints
The human hand is a complex and redundant system of coordinated movements that performs
a variety of motions. Using the movement dataset of the human hand determined from the
experimental paradigm (see Materials and Methods), the principal component analysis (PCA)
obtained 16 principal components (PC) as the movement dataset, potentially spanning a
16-dimensional space. The percentage of variance accounted for the joint angles by each suc-
cessive PC (bars in Fig 2) diminishes progressively, and the first few PCs can retain most of the
movement information of the original joint variables. For example, the first three PCs account
for 83.4±2.0% (mean ± standard deviations across subjects) of the variance, and the first seven
PCs account for nearly 96.4±0.7% of the variance. This demonstrates that the movement data-
sets of joint angles are hyper-redundant. This result provides an insight into the highly coordi-
nated movement among the joints in the human hand even when a lot of tasks need to be
performed.

 Comparison of the coordinated movement between tasks
The human hand coordinates multiple joints to dexterously perform different tasks in different
ways. The dexterous control strategy for each task can be described by the specific coordinated
movement between joints, as shown in Fig 3. The values of 120 coordinated variables by pair-
wise combinations of 16 joints are distributed along the ring circle in each radar chart in Fig 3.
The coordinated relationships concerned with the joints of thumb among the pairwise combi-
nations of all 16 joints are shown in area 1, the coordinated relationships concerned with the
joints of the index finger among the pairwise combinations of the remaining joints of the four
fingers without the thumb are shown in area 2, and so on. The six tasks were chosen to repre-
sent the features of all tasks. The results in Fig 3 indicate that the human hand can apply differ-
ent adjustments of coordinated relationships to realize a specific dexterous control strategy for
different tasks, such as a local adjustment of the coordinated relationships concerned with the
thumb joints (comparing Fig 3A and 3B), a wide range of adjustments of the coordinated rela-
tionships between joints (comparing Fig 3C and 3D), and adjustments based on the complexity
of tasks (comparing Fig 3E and 3F with Fig 3A or 3B). An extended discussion about the com-
parison of coordinated relationships between tasks is presented in S1 Text. The adjustments
make the movement-coordinated relationships between tasks have significant distinctions.
Not only for a single task, the joints of human hand are also coordinated during the move-
ment of multiple tasks [14]. The coordinated relationships between joints for these tasks are
called common coordinated relationships and can be derived from the pooled movement data-
sets composed of these tasks. The common coordinated relationships represent the dexterous
control strategy for satisfying the functional requirements of these tasks. Although many inves-
tigators have studied common coordinated relationships between fingers or joints using kine-
matic data, which are collected from subjects executing some tasks or during a period of
natural movements [11,13,16], most of these studies have been limited to a few types of differ-
ent tasks. As discussed in the previous study, the human hand adopts a distinctive control

 strategy for each task, and it is apparent to get different common coordinated relationships
between joints from the movement dataset composed of different tasks. When more tasks
need to be performed, the common coordinated relationships for all of these tasks will change,
but it is unknown whether the common coordinated relationships will always change with an
increase in tasks. In other words, do constant and basic common coordinated relationships
exist for the human hand when various tasks are performed? To answer this question, we stud-
ied the influence of richness of task type on the common coordinated relationships. When
several tasks are chosen, the evaluation index of mean movement coordination (MMC, see
Materials and Methods) is employed to show the general movement-coordinated relationships
among joints. As shown in Fig 4, a significant trend is that the coordination drops with an
increase in the number of task types despite the individual differences. When only one task is
chosen, the value of the MMC is higher. However, the coordination drops rapidly when more
tasks are added. This decrease of coordination indicates that the realization of more functions
requires more independent movements. However, the coordination does not always decrease.
Fig 3. Movement-coordinated relationships between joints of the human hand in each type of task. There are 16×(16–1)/2 = 120 variables of
movement-coordinated relationships between every two of the 16 joints recorded in the movement dataset, and they are distributed along the ring circle in
the radar chart. Area 1 represents the coordinated relationships regarding the joints of thumb and contains the internal relationships between the joints of the
thumb and the external relationships between the joints of thumb and the other four fingers. Similarly, area 2 represents the coordinated relationships
regarding o the joints of the index finger excluding the joints of the thumb, and so on. The coordinated relationships between all joints of the ring and little
fingers are represented in area 4 of the chart. The amplitudes of the coordinated relationships are averaged across all subjects. The six tasks are chosen to
represent the features of all tasks.

 The rate of decrease becomes quite slow and the MMC value turns into invariableness when
many tasks are included, especially when more than 20 types of tasks are chosen, as shown in
Fig 4. The invariable coordination shows that constant common coordinated relationships
exist for human hand to perform various tasks. The characteristics of the invariable coordina-
tion also reflect the basic dexterous control strategy of the human hand to satisfy the functional
requirement of various tasks.
Movement-coordinated relationships between joints during all the tasks
In the previous comparisons, each task had its own distinctive movement-coordinated rela-
tionships between joints to achieve their respective dexterous control strategies. When the
movement datasets of 33 tasks were pooled to represent the movements of various tasks in
daily life, their common coordinated relationships would remain invariable, and the common
coordinated relationships revealed the inherent characteristics of the human hand. We ana-
lyzed the pooled movement dataset composed of these tasks to determine the detailed coordi-
nated characteristic between joints to explore the basic dexterous control strategy of the
human hand for various tasks.
The coordinated relationship for a joint pair was calculated by the correlation coefficient
between the time-varying angular data. The values of movement-coordinated relationships for
all combinations of the 16 joints were averaged across subjects and can be expressed by the
matrix R 2 <16�16. A graph (Fig 5) is used to represent the numerical value of the matrix by
the grayscale in each square. The grayscale graph is then colored with pastel shades of pink to
strength the visual effects, with pink representing higher coordination. The characteristics of
coordinated relationships between each pair of joints in Fig 5 are discussed in the S2 Text.
An agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis is used to explore the general movement-
coordinated relationships among joints. The analysis from the averaged movement-coordi-
nated relationships across subjects (the same values as in Fig 5) results in a tree structure (den-
drogram) of relationships among all joint variables. The dendrogram (Fig 6) shows the
Fig 4. Relationship between the mean movement coordination (MMC) and the numbers of task types.
It shows some representative results from several subjects. Abbreviate: SUBJ, Subject.

 continuously agglomerative process of the cluster method from the bottom up. The PIP joint
of the ring finger and the PIP joint of the little finger first meet at a node among all joints. This
denotes that the average coordination across subjects for these two joints is the highest among
all the combinations of joint pairs. However, taking into account individual differences, the
coordination for the PIP joint pair of the ring and little fingers is 0.9285 ± 0.0241 (mean ± stan-
dard deviations across subjects), and the coordination for the PIP joint pair of the middle and
ring fingers is 0.9261 ± 0.0449. The coordination for the PIP joint pair of the ring and little fin-
gers is not significantly higher than the coordination for the PIP joint pair of the middle and
ring fingers (29, t = 0.25; p = 0.40). It suggests that the coordination for the PIP joint pair of the
ring and little fingers may be lower than that between the middle and ring fingers in a consider-
able number of the subjects. Thus, the first clustering for the PIP joints of the ring and little fin-
gers has no statistical significance. In the following clustering process, the PIP joints of the ring
and little fingers meet the PIP joint of the middle finger at a higher height of node, and the
three joints were clustered to a group. The coordination is 0.8753 ± 0.0511 between the old
cluster of PIP joints of the little and ring fingers and the PIP joint of middle finger, which is
also equivalent to the similarity measurement between clusters (rUV, see Materials and Meth-
ods). This coordination is significantly higher than the coordinated relationships between the
old cluster with any others clusters in this agglomerative phase (corrected p = 0.013<0.05).
The clustering of the three PIP joints has statistical significance, and all the significant clusters
are marked under the respective clustering nodes in Fig 6.
Considering the significant clustering results from the top down in Fig 6, we can draw four
main coordinated characteristics between joints during the movement of various tasks. First,
an overall characteristic is that the joints of the four fingers are clustered into a group, while

the higher coordination for the corresponding joint pair. The diagram is axisymmetric. Dashed and solid lines
passing through squares are used to describe different areas for joint pairs. The joints and abbreviated
names are shown in Fig 1.

 the joints of the thumb are clustered to one another. The coordinated relationship between the
two groups is only 0.16 ± 0.05. The movements of the thumb joints have quite poor coordi-
nated relationships with the joints of the four fingers. It should be noted that we ignored the
result of a clustering group between the CMC and ABD joints of the thumb because they
belong to a non-orthogonal and non-intersecting compound joint. Second, the joints of the
four fingers are divided into two clusters, the PIP and DIP joints and the MCP joints. This
demonstrates not only that the PIP and DIP joints in each finger are more coordinated than
the MCP joint but also that all PIP and DIP joints of the four fingers are more coordinated
than the MCP joints during the movement of various tasks. This coordinated characteristic
indicates that the dexterous control of the human hand is not based on singer fingers but on
joints. If control of the human hand was based on a single finger, the three joints of every finger
should be more coordinated within one other than with the joints of the other fingers. The
movement characteristic coincides with the functional need of the human hand to coordinate
all joints to perform tasks in daily life more than to have selective control of the operation of
individual fingers, such as for counting and playing the piano. Third, the movements of the
joints of the index finger are distinct from the other joints of the middle, ring and little fingers.
The joints of the index finger are separated from other fingers in both the cluster of the PIP
and DIP joints and the cluster of the MCP joints of the four fingers (Fig 6). Fourth, the PIP
joints of the middle, ring and little fingers are clustered in a group. The PIP joints are more
coordinated among the PIP and DIP joints of the three fingers. In addition, to test whether
these movement characteristics are related to the gender, we also group the movement data of
Fig 6. Dendrogram of the clustering of joints. This graphically shows the network of movement-coordinated relationships among the joints of the human
hand. The lower branch nodes of the tree indicate better-coordinated relationships between the joints under the two branches. The significances of clustering
are marked with * (p<0.05), ** (p<0.01) and *** (p<0.001) under the nodes.

 female and male subjects to separately study their movement characteristics. As shown in S2
Fig, the significant clustering results in female and male subjects are the same as the results of
the whole subjects (Fig 6), although there are some differences in the non-significant clustering
nodes. The main movement characteristics are consistent between females and males.
Discussion
An important advantage that makes human hand superior to other animals is that the human
hand can dexterously perform various tasks, and this unique ability can apparently facilitate
the capacity for more effective tool making and tool use during the evolutionary process [29].
To explore the dexterous ability of the human hand, we adopted the reverse research method,
going from the result to the reason. In previous work, we studied what basic movement charac-
teristics are required for the human hand to perform multiple tasks dexterously. The following
discussions are devoted to finding clear corresponding evidence to determine the reasons for
hand coordination.
The movement characteristics of all joints of the human hand show that the joints of the
thumb have lower coordinated relationships with the joints of the four fingers. The movement
of the thumb is distinct from that of the four fingers. The flexor digitorum profundus (FDP)
muscle is an important flexor muscle of the human hand and is located on the underside of the
forearm (S3 and S4A Figs). In most non-hominoid primates, the FDP muscle separates five
long tendons, and each attaches to one digit [30]. As shown in S4B Fig of a Barbary ape hand,
the four fingers and thumb are interconnected by these long tendons of the FDP muscle. How-
ever, in the great apes (i.e., Pongo, Gorilla and Pan), the FDP tendon to the thumb is usually
either vestigial or absent [31]. In humans, the FDP muscle only attaches to the four fingers,
while the thumb has a separate long flexor muscle in the forearm called the flexor pollicis
longus (FPL) muscle (S3 and S4A Figs). The presence of the FPL muscle is a specialization in
humans and enormously increases the independence of the thumb. The movement characteris-
tics of the human hand show that the thumb needs to be able to move independently of the
other four fingers to perform various tasks. Fortunately, the presence of the FPL exactly satis-
fies the functional requirement and offers the human hand superior capacities to perform a
variety of complex functions compared to other primates. In addition to the FDP muscle, the
flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and extensor digitorum communis muscles are the other
hand multi-tendon muscles. They only connect the four fingers as well, while the movements
of the thumb joints are driven by exclusive muscles. The separate biomechanical structure of
the thumb is reflected in the poor movement-coordinated relationships between the thumb
and the four fingers.
Another movement characteristic of the human hand is that the PIP and DIP joints of the
four fingers are more coordinated than the MCP joins. The flexion motions of the DIP and PIP
joints of each finger are primarily due to the separate actions of the FDP and FDS muscles [32].
The FDP muscle attaches to the distal phalanx of the finger with tendons (S5A Fig) and pri-
marily generates motion at the DIP joint, while the FDS muscle inserts on the middle phalanx
and primarily contributes to the flexion motion of the PIP joint [33]. However, flexion move-
ment needs not only a synergist of flexor muscles but also an antagonist of extensor muscles to
form an equilibration. An important extensor muscle is located in the forearm and performs
via the long extensor tendon (S5A Fig). At the distal end of the metacarpal, the extensor tendon
expands to form a hood (S5B Fig), which covers the MCP joint dorsally and warps around the
sides of the metacarpal and proximal phalanx [34]. The extensor expansion soon splits into
three bands, two lateral bands and a single central band, to attach to the distal and middle pha-
langes, respectively. Lateral bands collaterally pass on either side of the proximal phalanx and

 recombine again at the middle phalanx to attach to the distal phalanx. The central band passes
down the middle of the finger along the back of the proximal phalanx and stretches to the base
of the middle phalanx. The compound tendinous attachments of the extensor expansion con-
nect the PIP and DIP joints and make the two joints rotate as a mechanism with one degree
of freedom when the FDP is active, together with the taut central and lateral bands [35–37].
Detailed descriptions of the coupling principle can be found in the literature [35,38]. The spe-
cific structure of extensor expansion causes the movement of the PIP and DIP joints in each
finger to be better coordinated. In addition, the flexion motions of the PIP and DIP joints for
each finger are derived from the same muscles, FDP and FDS, which are two extrinsic flexor
muscles (S3 Fig). About halfway down the forearm, both the FDP and FDS muscles narrow to
form four separate tendons, which pass to their respective fingers. The same muscles connect
the four fingers and carry out the coordinated movements of the DIP joints or PIP joints of the
four fingers. In combination with the structure of extensor expansion, these anatomical struc-
tures lead to better-coordinated relationships among all PIP and DIP joints of the four fingers.
The coordinated characteristics between the joints of the four fingers also suggest that the
movements of the MCP joints have significant difference with the PIP and DIP joints. Flexion
at the MCP joint is brought about primarily by the lumbrical muscles, aided by the tendons of
the FDP and FDS as well as the interosseous muscles. Except for the same muscles for the PIP
and DIP joints, such as the FDP and FDS muscles, the particular lumbrical muscles for the
MCP joints increase the diversity of movement and result in the relative independence of the
MCP joints compared to the PIP and DIP joints of the four fingers. Moreover, the intrinsic
muscles of lumbrical and interossei have specific actions on the movement of the four fingers.
These intrinsic muscles pass along the finger and insert into the extensor expansion near the
MCP joint (S5 Fig). On the one hand, because of the tendon crossing the palmar side of the
MCP joint, pulling of the interosseous and lumbrical muscles causes the flexion movement of
the MCP joint. On the other hand, because these muscles join the extensor expansion, which
crosses the dorsal side of the finger, pulling of the interosseous and lumbrical muscles also
results in the extension movement of the PIP and DIP joints. The movement direction of the
tendon is shown with the red arrows in S5A Fig. The structural features of these intrinsic mus-
cles, which contribute to both flexion of the MCP joint and extension of the PIP and DIP joints
at the same time, further increase the movement difference between the MCP joints and IP
(PIP and DIP) joints during various tasks.
The characteristics of coordinated movement between fingers indicate that the movements
of the joints of index finger are distinct from the other fingers. Four fingers are connected by
the FDP muscle. It ends in four tendons to flex the four fingers coordinately, but the part that
acts on the index finger is usually distinct. The FDP has a muscle group common to the middle,
ring and little fingers (S3 Fig) and the muscle bellies and tendons for these fingers are intercon-
nected by areolar tissue and tendinous slips to some extent [39,40]. The tendon to the index
finger often has its own belly and remains discernibly separate from the other fingers through-
out its course from the muscle belly to the palm [41,42]. The conspicuous separation of the
muscle belly and tendon for the index finger from the other fingers can be responsible for the
specialization of the independent functions of the index finger, whereas the other three fingers
work together.
The movement characteristics between the PIP and DIP joints of the middle, ring and little
fingers show that the PIP joints of these fingers are more coordinated. When considering a sin-
gle finger, the movement of the PIP and DIP joints is better coordinated during the perfor-
mance of various tasks. The most intuitive solution to satisfy this characteristic is that the
two joints are coupled by a mechanism and directly actuated by a muscle. In fact, each finger of
the human hand has two different muscles to control the two joints separately. The better-

 coordinated relationship is guaranteed by the specific structure of the extensor expansion. The
benefit of such a design is to give independent movement ability to the DIP joint apart from
the simultaneous movement with the PIP joint. For example, the DIP joint can still move to
adapt to an irregularly shaped object when the middle phalanx has contacted the object during
a power grasp. The design of the driving mechanism provides the DIP joints of fingers with
more independent movement to enhance the adapted ability of the human hand, while the PIP
joints remain the better-coordinated relationships.
Therefore, all the characteristics of coordinated movement for various grasp tasks can be
found the clear corresponding evidences from the muscular-articular connective architecture
of the human hand. These characteristics of coordinated movement reflect the basic functional
requirements for dexterous performance of various tasks. And the muscular-articular connec-
tive architecture of the human hand exactly meets such functional requirements. This suggests
that there is no need for the human hand to control each joint independently. If there was not
such biomechanical architecture, such as the separated connection of each articular from a sin-
gle muscle, it would significantly increase the computational burden of the CNS to make up for
the loss of the biomechanical architecture. Thus, the architecture is the biomechanical basis of
the dexterous movement that provides the human hand with the amazing ability to perform a
multitude of daily tasks in a comfortable way. In conclusion, our study can improve the under-
standing of the human hand and confirm that the mechanical architecture is the proper design
by the Creator for dexterous performance of numerous functions following the evolutionary
remodeling of the ancestral hand for millions of years. Moreover, functional explanations for
the mechanical architecture of the muscular-articular connection of the human hand can also
aid in developing multifunctional robotic hands by designing them with similar basic
architecture.
