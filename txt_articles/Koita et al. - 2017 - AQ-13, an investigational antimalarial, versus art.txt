Summary
Background Chloroquine was used for malaria treatment until resistant Plasmodium falciparum was identified. 
Because 4-aminoquinolines with modified side chains, such as AQ-13, are active against resistant parasites, we 
compared AQ-13 against artemether plus lumefantrine for treatment of uncomplicated P falciparum malaria.
Methods We did a randomised, non-inferiority trial. We screened men (≥18 years) with uncomplicated malaria in 
Missira (northeast Mali) and Bamako (capital of Mali) for eligibility (≥2000 asexual P falciparum parasites per µL of 
blood). Eligible participants were randomly assigned to either the artemether plus lumefantrine group or AQ-13 
group by permuting blocks of four with a random number generator. Physicians and others caring for the participants 
were masked, except for participants who received treatment and the research pharmacist who implemented the 
randomisation and provided treatment. Participants received either 80 mg of oral artemether and 480 mg of oral 
lumefantrine twice daily for 3 days or 638·50 mg of AQ-13 base (two oral capsules) on days 1 and 2, and 319·25 mg 
base (one oral capsule) on day 3. Participants were monitored for parasite clearance (50 µL blood samples twice daily 
at 12 h intervals until two consecutive negative samples were obtained) and interviewed for adverse events (once every 
day) as inpatients during week 1. During the 5-week outpatient follow-up, participants were examined for adverse 
events and recurrent infection twice per week. All participants were included in the intention-to-treat analysis and 
per-protocol analysis, except for those who dropped out in the per-protocol analysis. The composite primary outcome 
was clearance of asexual parasites and fever by day 7, and absence of recrudescent infection by parasites with the 
same molecular markers from days 8 to 42 (defined as cure). Non-inferiority was considered established if the 
proportion of patients who were cured was higher for artemether plus lumefantrine than for AQ-13 and the upper 
limit of the 95% CI was less than the non-inferiority margin of 15%. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT01614964.
Findings Between Aug 6 and Nov 18, 2013, and between Sept 18 and Nov 20, 2015, 66 Malian men with uncomplicated 
malaria were enrolled. 33 participants were randomly assigned to each group. There were no serious adverse events 
(grade 2–4) and asexual parasites were cleared by day 7 in both groups. 453 less-severe adverse events (≤grade 1) were 
reported: 214 in the combination group and 239 in the AQ-13 group. Two participants withdrew from the AQ-13 
group after parasite clearance and three were lost to follow-up. In the artemether plus lumefantrine group, two 
participants had late treatment failures (same markers as original isolates). On the basis of the per-protocol analysis, 
the AQ-13 and artemether plus lumefantrine groups had similar proportions cured (28 [100%] of 28 vs 31 [93·9%] of 
33; p=0·50) and AQ-13 was not inferior to artemether plus lumefantrine (difference –6·1%, 95% CI –14·7 to 2·4). 
Proportions cured were also similar between the groups in the intention-to-treat analysis (28 of 33, 84·8% for AQ-13 
vs 31 of 33, 93·9% for artemether and lumefantrine; p=0·43) but the upper bound of the 95% CI exceeded the 15% 
non-inferiority margin (difference 9·1%, 95% CI –5·6 to 23·8).
Interpretation The per-protocol analysis suggested non-inferiority of AQ-13 to artemether plus lumefantrine. By 
contrast, the intention-to-treat analysis, which included two participants who withdrew and three who were lost to 
follow-up from the AQ-13 group, did not meet the criterion for non-inferiority of AQ-13, although there were no 
AQ-13 treatment failures. Studies with more participants (and non-immune participants) are needed to decide 
whether widespread use of modified 4-aminoquinolones should be recommended.

Introduction
Plasmodium falciparum parasites that are resistant to 
chloroquine were first identified more than 50 years ago 
in southeast Asia1 and South America2 as it became 
apparent that treatment of malaria due to chloroquine-
resistant P falciparum (defined as 50% inhibitory 
concentrations [IC50s] >200 nM) often failed in 
non-immune individuals.3 Subsequently, chloroquine-
resistant P falciparum has spread to east and west Africa,4 
across South America,5 and to Oceania.6
Studies of 4-aminoquinoline (4-AQ) activity against 
P falciparum have shown that aminoquinolines with 
side chains shorter (two to three carbons) or longer (ten 
to 12 carbons) than the five carbon isopentyl side chain 
of chloroquine are active against chloroquine-resistant 
P falciparum.7 For this reason, an Investigational New 
Drug (IND) application (IND 055,670) was submitted 
to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to 
examine the lead compound from those studies (AQ-13 
[N�-(7-chloro-4-quinolinyl)-N,N-diethyl-1,3-
propanediamine dihydrochloride trihydrate], which 
has a linear three carbon n-propyl side chain) in 
healthy human beings to determine if its pharma- 
cokinetics and safety profiles were similar to those of 
chloroquine.
Because the lead compound, AQ-13, from studies of 
structure and activity was active in vitro against 
chloroquine-resistant 
and 
chloroquine-susceptible 
P falciparum,8 and safe in human participants,9 we 
postulated that the efficacy and safety of AQ-13 for 
uncomplicated P falciparum malaria would not be 
inferior to that of artemether plus lumefantrine; in this 
trial we aimed to test the hypothesis.
Methods
Study design and participants
Because the efficacy of artemether with lumefantrine for 
uncomplicated P falciparum malaria is 95% or more,10 
and because AQ-13 had not been used to treat malaria in 
people, we used a non-inferiority study design.11 This 
study comprised a 1-week inpatient stay and two 
outpatient follow-up visits every week for the next 
5 weeks (total of 6 weeks), and was done at the Clinical 
Research Center in Bamako, Mali. Participants recruited 
were Malian men with uncomplicated P falciparum 
malaria (fever, chills, or other symptoms; and a positive 
blood smear, with 2000 or more asexual P falciparum 
parasites per µL of blood). Men aged 18 years or older 
were enrolled because they are semi-immune and 
therefore protected from severe disease (appendix). 
Women were excluded at the request of the FDA to 
prevent exposure to an investigational drug during 
pregnancy. Additional exclusion criteria were severe or 
cerebral malaria, plasmodia infection other than 
P falciparum, a blood haemoglobin concentration of 
7 g/dL or less, medications for chronic diseases or 
conditions other than malaria, and other health problems 
requiring diagnosis or treatment.
All participants provided consent. Consent forms were 
prepared in English and translated to French and viewed 
and approved by the Tulane and Mali Institutional Review 
Boards before use. Information in the consent form was 
read to potential participants by investigators who 
understood the protocol and could discuss it in local 
languages.12
Ethical reviews and approvals were provided by 
institutional review boards at the Tulane University

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Chloroquine was the treatment of choice for Plasmodium 
falciparum malaria until chloroquine-resistant parasites were 
identified more than 50 years ago. We have considered 
evidence from several studies done in our laboratories and 
those of colleagues worldwide, beginning in 1981. During this 
period, we have done many literature searches using different 
search terms without restriction to language each year. For 
these reasons, we have not listed the specific search criteria or 
results. Although chloroquine-resistant P falciparum have 
continued to be problem, our recent studies have shown that 
4-aminoquinolines (4-AQs) with modified side chains, such as 
AQ-13, are active against chloroquine-resistant parasites and 
safe in human beings, and have pharmacokinetics similar to 
chloroquine.
Added value of this study
In this randomised, non-inferiority clinical trial of Malian 
men with uncomplicated P falciparum malaria, the 
per-protocol analysis suggested non-inferiority of AQ-13 to 
artemether plus lumefantrine. By contrast, the 
intention-to-treat analysis, which included two participants 
who withdrew and three participants lost to follow-up from 
the AQ-13 group, did not meet the criterion for 
non-inferiority of AQ-13, although there were no AQ-13 
treatment failures. Adverse events were much the same in 
each group.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our results indicate that AQ-13 is not inferior to artemether 
plus lumefantrine for treatment of uncomplicated P 
falciparum malaria due to chloroquine-resistant and 
chloroquine-susceptible parasites. Modified 4-AQs, such as 
AQ-13 might expand the currently limited number of 
antimalarial drugs active against drug-resistant parasites. 
Additional studies with non-immune patients and more 
participants are needed to decide whether to recommend 
widespread use of modified 4-AQs for uncomplicated 
malaria.

(New Orleans, LA, USA; FWA 00002055) and the 
University of Bamako (Mali; FWA 00001679). The 
protocol is available online.
Randomisation and masking
Enrolled participants were randomly assigned to either 
artemether plus lumefantrine or AQ-13. The statistician 
(FJM) prepared the randomisation by permuting blocks 
of four with a random number generator. Although the 
original plan was to provide this information in sealed 
envelopes, an electronic list was provided instead at the 
request of the investigators in Mali. The randomisation 
was implemented in Mali by the research pharmacist 
(AM) who met twice daily with each participant on 
days 1–3 of their inpatient stay and observed their 
treatment. Physicians and others caring for the 
participants were masked to allocation, except the 
research pharmacist who provided treatment. Neither 
the study statistician nor the research pharmacist had 
other involvement with the performance or supervision 
of this clinical trial. Patients were not masked to the 
treatments they received.
Because previous studies have shown more rapid 
clearance of asexual parasites from the blood with 
artemisinins than with 4-AQs, such as chloroquine or 
amodiaquine,13 we expected parasite clearance times to 
be shorter with artemether plus lumefantrine than with 
AQ-13. Therefore, to avoid inadvertent unmasking of the 
study, parasite clearance times were not compared for 
the two treatment groups until after the study data were 
unblinded on Jan 2, 2016.
Procedures
Potential participants were screened for abnormal 
laboratory results unrelated to malaria using the hepatic 
and renal disease panels for the Piccolo Xpress chemistry 
analyzer (Princeton, NJ, USA) and complete blood counts 
from the Beckman coulter counter (Indianapolis, IN, 
USA). Enrolled participants randomly assigned to 
artemether with lumefantrine received 80 mg of oral 
artemether and 480 mg of oral lumefantrine twice a day 
for 3 days as recommended in the package insert 
(Coartem; Novartis Beijing, Beijing, China; Pharma AG, 
Basel, Switzerland). Those assigned to AQ-13 received 
638·50 mg of AQ-13 base (two capsules) on days 1 and 2, 
and 319·25 mg base (one capsule) on day 3 based on the 
phase 1 study9 (appendix). AQ-13 was synthesised under 
current good manufacturing practice guidelines by 
Girindus America (Cincinnati, OH, USA) and transported 
to the study site at 15–30°C.7,8
During the 5-week follow-up, two outpatient visits per 
week 
occurred 
and 
interval 
histories, 
physical 
examinations, and blood smears were done. Additionally, 
a follow-up eye examination on day 7 occurred and 1 h 
Holter recordings were obtained on days 7 and 14. We 
used fingerstick blood samples (50 µL obtained twice daily 
during week 1) until there were two consecutive negative 
smears to monitor parasite clearance. During the twice 
weekly outpatient follow-up visits from week 2 to week 6, 
we examined participants for fever, parasitaemia, and 
other evidence of recurrence. Clearance and recrudescence 
were based on Giemsa-stained thick smears plus PCR-
based molecular markers for recrudescence.
Blood smears were prepared on glass slides, stained 
with Giemsa, and stored in slide boxes after reading. Filter 
paper blots were labelled, placed in individual plastic bags 
with desiccant, and stored at ambient temperature. Blood 
samples for haematological testing were drawn in tubes 
containing heparin and for chemistry testing in tubes 
containing EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid). These 
samples were transported to the clinical laboratory within 
2–3 h. Blood samples for AQ-13 measurements were 
stored in EDTA at 4°C until the time of analysis.
Most participants had minimal literacy, so they could not 
use diaries to record adverse events. Therefore, potential 
events14 were discussed with each patient by the 
investigators and clinical centre staff daily during the 
1-week inpatient stay and twice per week during the 5-week 
outpatient follow-up period. Participants were asked to 
respond to a list of questions on the case report forms. 
Potential adverse events discussed included fever, 
weakness, myalgias and arthralgias, headache, anorexia, 
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, cough, 
pruritus, tinnitus, influenza-like symptoms, pallor, and 
jaundice. Participants were encouraged to report all adverse 
events, not just those listed. Potential participants were 
examined during screening to identify people with reduced 
visual acuity or abnormalities of the eyelids, cornea, iris, or 
retina.9 After oral treatment on inpatient days 1–3, the eye 
examination was repeated on day 7 to identify if there had 
been any change or if there was evidence of ocular toxicity.
Cardiac adverse events, such as arrhythmias and 
heart block, were detected with Holter monitoring and 
was done for 1 h during screening, for 24 h each day on 
days 1–4 of the inpatient stay, and for 1 h during the 
outpatient follow-up visits on days 7 and 14.9 These 
recordings were reviewed on the basis of the QT 
interval summary report provided by HolterCare 
(version 10.6.0) for arrhythmias and heart block in Mali 
and for evidence of QTc (corrected QT) prolongation 
after treatment with either drug.
In our studies of pharmacokinetics, blood samples 
for measurements of concentrations of AQ-13 and its 
primary and secondary metabolites (AQ-72 and AQ-
73)15 were obtained from the participants enrolled in 
this study and randomly assigned to AQ-13 during 2015 
after additional training on drawing timed venous 
blood samples had been provided to the investigators 
and staff. Beginning after informed consent was 
obtained, serial 5·0 mL blood samples were drawn 
from each participant before treatment began on day 1 
(0 time baseline sample), after treatment on days 1–3 
(n=21 samples), daily during the remainder of the 
inpatient stay (n=3), and twice weekly during the

subsequent 5-week outpatient follow-up period (n=10, 
∑=35; appendix).
To 
assess 
parasite 
genotype 
for 
measuring 
recrudescence, we did sequencing. After nested PCR 
amplifications using primers for 546 bp and 166 bp 
amplicons within pfcrt (appendix),16,17 dideoxynucleotide 
sequencing was done to identify the pfcrt haplotypes 
(aminoacids 72–76—ie, CVIET and CVMNK) of the 
isolates from all participants. Additionally, allotype-
specific primers were used to amplify block 2 sequences 
from 
merozoite 
surface 
protein 
1 
after 
initial 
amplification with universal primers in blocks 1 and 5.18
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was clinical cure, a composite of 
clearance of asexual P falciparum parasites from the 
blood and fever by day 7, and the absence of recrudescent 
infection with the same parasite genotype18 between the 
time of initial parasite clearance and the final outpatient 
visit on day 42. The proportions of patients cured were 
calculated for artemether with lumefantrine and AQ-13, 
and differences between proportions cured were 
calculated with 95% CIs. Non-inferiority of AQ-13 was 
considered established if the proportion cured was 
higher for artemether plus lumefantrine than for AQ-13 
and the upper limit of the 95% CI for the differences 
between the proportions cured was less than the non-
inferiority margin of 15%.
Secondary outcomes included adverse events within 
28 days of treatment judged as either possibly, likely, or 
definitely related to treatment by masked physician-
investigators,14 times from treatment to parasite and fever 
clearance, 
mean 
decrease 
in 
the 
haemoglobin 
concentration from days 1 to 4, new atrial or ventricular 
arrhythmias, new first, second, or third degree heart 
block, prolongation of the QT interval, and decreases in 
visual acuity. Parasite clearance time was defined as the 
time of the first persistently negative thick blood smears 
for asexual P falciparum parasites during the 1 week 
inpatient stay, and fever clearance time was defined as the 
first persistently normal temperature (<37·5°C) during 
week 1 of inpatient stay.
Tertiary outcomes included the pharmacokinetics of 
AQ-13 N-dealkylated metabolites (AQ-72, AQ-73) based 
on blood concentrations which were measured using 
a high-performance liquid chromatography assay 
developed for this purpose9,15 and the frequency of 
pruritus after treatment. Because neither the primary 
nor the secondary metabolites of AQ-13 are active in vitro 
against chloroquine-resistant P falciparum, pharma-
cokinetic parameters potentially related to efficacy have 
been provided only for AQ-13.
Statistical analysis
Sample size estimates were based on a 15% non-
inferiority margin, 95% cure for those given artemether 
with lumefantrine, and 20% attrition after treatment10 
with the power (1 – β=80%) to detect a 15% or greater 
decrease in efficacy, which yielded sample sizes of 33 per 
group and 66 participants in total. Testing of the primary 
and secondary outcomes was done with the Fisher’s exact

were done in GraphPad Prism (version 6.07). Times to 
parasite and fever clearance were compared with Kaplan-
Meier survival curves and tested for significance using 
the log-rank test. Pharmacokinetic parameters for AQ-13 
from phase 2 efficacy studies were based on non-
compartmental analysis with the use of the Win Nonlin 
software in Pharsight (version 6.5) and compared with 
t tests for which p values less than 0·05 were considered 
significant. Two-sided testing was used for all statistical 
comparisons.
The data and safety monitoring board did an interim 
analysis after 33 patients were enrolled in the study. This 
trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT01614964.

Results
Participants were enrolled from Aug 6 to Nov 18, 2013, 
and from Sept 18 to Nov 20, 2015. No participants were 
enrolled in 2014 because of concern the criterion for 
screening (fever in the absence of localising signs) could 
lead to the enrolment of people with Ebola virus disease.19
202 individuals in Missira, northeast Mali, and 139 in 
Bamako were screened. 275 individuals did not meet the 
inclusion criteria and 66 participants were enrolled. Of 
those enrolled, half were randomly assigned to 
artemether plus lumefantrine and the other half were 
randomly assigned to AQ-13. In the artemether plus 
lumefantrine group, 33 participants were treated 
successfully and 31 completed the 42-day follow-up, 
whereas two had late treatment failures on days 17 and 
21. In the AQ-13 group, 33 participants were treated 
successfully and 28 completed the 42-day follow-up, 
whereas two withdrew on day 4 for personal reasons and 
three were lost to follow-up on days 10, 28, and 35. All 
those given artemether plus lumefantrine were included

Figure 3: Mean blood concentrations of AQ-13 after oral treatment from 
days 1 to 8
Mean blood concentrations of AQ-13 after treatment with 1596·25 mg of AQ-13 
base on days 1–3 are based on serial 5·0 mL venous blood samples from 
17 participants randomly assigned to and given AQ-13 in 2015. Error bars are 
95% CIs. The mean AQ-13 blood concentrations observed 7–8 days after the 
start of treatment (800–1000 nM) were 40–50-times greater than the IC50s for 
chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum in vitro (15–20 nM).7,8

in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses, 
whereas only 28 given AQ-13 were included in the per-
protocol analysis because two withdrew and three were 
lost to follow-up (figure 1).
Baseline characteristics were similar in each group 
(table 1, appendix). Treatment based on randomisation to 
either intervention group was confirmed by fluorescence 
high-performance liquid chromatography assays for 
AQ-13,9,15 which were positive for participants randomly 
assigned to AQ-13 and negative for those randomly 
assigned to artemether plus lumefantrine.
The components of the primary endpoint (clearance of 
asexual parasites and fever by day 7) were achieved for all 
participants in both groups. The third component 
(absence of recrudescence with the original parasites 
from days 8 to 42) was achieved for 31 (93·9%) of 
33 participants in the artemether plus lumefantrine 
group and 28 (100%) of 28 in the AQ-13 group (table 2). 
The per-protocol analyses showed that the proportions 
cured were greater for AQ-13 than for artemether plus 
lumefantrine (28 [100%] of 28 vs 31 [93·9%] of 33) with a 
difference of –6·1% (95% CI –14·7 to 2·4); therefore 
AQ-13 was non-inferior according to this anaylsis. By 
contrast, the intention-to-treat analyses showed that the 
proportions cured were lower for AQ-13 than for 
artemether plus lumefantrine (28 [84·8%] of 33 vs 
31 [93·9%] of 33) with a difference of 9·1% (–5·6 to 23·8), 
for which the upper boundary of the 95% CI exceeded 
the non-inferiority margin of 15%.
There were no early parasitological or clinical failures 
on days 1–3. Parasite clearance times (based on blood 
smears taken twice in a day) were shorter for participants 
assigned to artemether plus lumefantrine than for those 
assigned to AQ-13 (p=0·002; figure 2). By contrast, fever 
clearance times were shorter for those randomly assigned 
to AQ-13 than for those assigned to artemether plus 
lumefantrine (p=0·01; appendix). When the α used to 
identify significant differences was adjusted for multiple 
tests (table 2), parasite clearance times remained 
significantly shorter for those given artemether plus 
lumefantrine than for those given AQ-13 (figure 2), 
whereas the fever clearance times were significantly 
shorter for AQ-13 than for artemether plus lumefantrine 
(appendix). Although two participants in the AQ-13 
group withdrew from the study on day 4, both had 
received five capsules of AQ-13 (1596 mg base) on 
days 1–3 and had cleared all asexual parasites on day 3. 
Likewise, the three participants lost to follow-up from the 
AQ-13 group on days 10, 28, and 35 had cleared all 
asexual parasites on day 3. By contrast, two participants 
in the artemether plus lumefantrine group had 
recurrences on days 17 and 21. Because the parasites 
causing these recurrences had the same molecular 
markers as the original infections in these participants,18 
they were considered recrudescences (late treatment 
failures) rather than new infections: RO33 allotype 
parasites for participant 2010, and K1 and MAD20 
allotype parasites for participant 2033.
Pharmacokinetic studies for the 17 participants 
randomly assigned to receive AQ-13 in 2015 identified 
separate peaks for each AQ-13 dose on days 1, 2, and 3 
(figure 3). Mean blood concentration of AQ-13 8 days after

the start of treatment was 800 nM, which is about 
40–50 times higher than the 15–20 nM IC50 of AQ-13 for 
chloroquine-resistant parasites.7 Blood concentration data 
are provided only for AQ-13 because the metabolites of 
AQ-13 (AQ-72 and AQ-73) are not active against 
chloroquine-resistant P falciparum. Table 3 shows 
pharmacokinetic parameters for AQ-13 based on blood 
samples from the 17 participants randomised to receive 
AQ-13 in 2015. Neither the 1-week area under the curve, 
elimination half-life, time from beginning treatment to 
the maximal concentration, peak maximal concentration, 
nor other pharmacokinetic parameters correlated with 
physical parameters such as height, weight, or body-mass 
index (data not shown).
On the basis of the eye examinations,9 there were no 
differences in visual acuity between the groups (table 2). 
Only 31 (93·9%) of 33 participants given AQ-13 had the 
follow-up eye exam on day 7 because two participants 
withdrew from the study on day 4.
Holter recordings showed that all participants were in 
normal sinus rhythm at screening and enrolment, and 
none had atrial or ventricular arrhythmias during the 
inpatient stay (days 1–4) or the outpatient visits on days 7 
and 14.9 Likewise, none had first, second, or third degree 
heart block during the inpatient stay or the outpatient 
follow-up visits (table 2). One participant was excluded 
from the study because of heart failure with ventricular 
bigeminy. This patient had uncomplicated P falciparum 
malaria and was referred to the senior cardiologist after 
receiving artemether with lumefantrine. No significant 
increases in the QTc interval were observed after 
treatment with either artemether plus lumefantrine or 
AQ-13 (data not shown). Additionally, comparison of QTc 
intervals at the time of peak AQ-13 blood concentrations 
4 h after dosing for artemether plus lumefantrine and for 
AQ-13 showed no differences (table 2).
No serious, grade 2, grade 3, or grade 4 adverse events14 
were identified in participants given either artemether 
plus lumefantrine or AQ-13. Because some adverse 
events were expected and had been reported with the 
same dose of AQ-13 in the phase 1 study,9 participants 
were asked about potential adverse events daily during 
the 1-week inpatient stay and at each outpatient follow-up 
visit. Several less serious adverse events (≤grade 1) were 
reported by participants (table 4). Of the 453 less severe 
adverse events (≤grade 1) reported, those associated with 
acute malaria (fever, weakness, myalgias and arthralgias, 
headache, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal 
pain)20 were most common on days 1–3 (158 events 
per day), less common on days 4–6 (11 events per day), 
and least common on days 7–28 (three events per day). 
There were no significant differences in the frequencies 
of less serious adverse events for individuals between the 
treatment groups.
Pruritus had a different temporal pattern to the other 
adverse events. Reports of pruritus were most frequent 
on days 4–6 (nine events per day), less frequent on 
days 1–3 (six events per day), and least frequent on 
days 7–28 (0·2 events per day). However, there were no 
differences in the frequency of pruritus between the 
groups (p=0·13; table 4). The 1·5 g/dL decrease in 
haemoglobin concentration between days 1 and 4 in 
participants receiving artemether plus lumefantrine had 
not been expected (table 2). The decrease in haemoglobin 
concentration was greater in those given artemether plus 
lumefantrine than in those given AQ-13 (1·5 g d/L 
[95% CI 0·7–2·3] vs 0·4 g/dL [0·3–0·5]; p=0·02), 
although both were less than the grade 1 decrease on the 
AIDS grading scale (2·5–3·4 g/dL).14 When the α used to 
identify significant differences was adjusted for multiple 
tests, the decrease in haemoglobin concentration after 
treatment was no longer greater for artemether plus 
lumefantrine than for AQ-13 (data not shown).
Discussion
Our per-protocol analysis showed that AQ-13 was non-
inferior to artemether plus lumefantrine for the 
treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum 
malaria. However, in the intention-to-treat analysis, 
AQ-13 was inferior to artemether with lumefantrine, 
because of dropouts from the AQ-13 group.
The five AQ-13 failures in the intention-to-treat analysis 
were in participants lost to follow-up rather than true 
treatment failures, and we identified no cases in which 
AQ-13 treatment did not clear the parasite. Because the 
differences between per-protocol and intention-to-treat 
analyses were caused by more participants being lost to 
follow-up in the AQ-13 group, enrolling more participants

might have eliminated the discrepancies. However, we 
followed the recommendations of the US Food and Drug 
Administration to enrol the fewest participants necessary 
(to minimise the number exposed to candidate 
compounds that might not be efficacious).
The efficacy of artemether plus lumefantrine for the 
treatment of uncomplicated P falciparum malaria 
(≥95%)11,21 and the absence of efficacy data for AQ-13 
favoured a non-inferiority study design.10 However, 
because AQ-13 is a single agent and artemether plus 
lumefantrine is a combination therapy, the clinical 
outcomes might have been better for artemether plus 
lumefantrine than for AQ-13, even if AQ-13 was also 
efficacious because of the potential for complementary or 
synergistic interactions with drug combinations.
The similar ages, parasite densities, haemoglobin 
concentrations, and frequencies of the T76 and K76 
aminoacid point mutations (CVIET and CVMNK 
haplotypes) in both groups indicate there were no 
detectable differences in outcome related to pfcrt and 
suggest 
that 
randomisation 
distributed 
potential 
confounding factors successfully. The recrudescences 
(late treatment failures) reported with artemether plus 
lumefantrine were consistent with the 5% or less 
failure rate reported for this treatment.13,21 By contrast, 
no recrudescences were reported with AQ-13.
When the α used to identify significant differences was 
adjusted for multiple tests, the rate of parasite clearance 
remained significantly quicker for artemether plus 
lumefantrine than for AQ-13. However, neither the faster 
fever clearance with AQ-13 nor the greater fall in 
haemoglobin 
concentration 
after 
treatment 
with 
artemether plus lumefantrine remained significant. As a 
result, these data do not resolve those questions (ie, what is 
the frequency of haemolysis after artemisinin vs AQ-13 
treatment of uncomplicated malaria? And what is the 
relative parasite and fever clearance rates for artemisinins 
vs AQ-13?) because this study was not powered to address 
them. However, previous studies have found faster parasite 
clearance with artemether plus lumefantrine than with 
other antimalarial drugs,13 faster fever clearance with 
treatment regimens containing 4-AQ,22 and haemolysis 
after the treatment of severe malaria with artemisinins.23
The absence of serious, grade 2, grade 3, and grade 4 
adverse events in either group is consistent with data 
indicating serious adverse events are uncommon with 
artemether plus lumefantrine13,21,24,25 and with AQ-13,9 
although experience with AQ-13 is limited. As in the 
phase 1 study,9 several participants reported less serious 
(≤grade 1) adverse events with AQ-13, in particular for 
pruritus. Although pruritus has been associated with the 
use of 4-AQs,23 it has also been reported in people treated 
with artemether plus lumefantrine, artesunate plus 
sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine, and other antimalarial 
drugs.21,25 For this reason, our observations are consistent 
with reports by other investigators on pruritus after 
antimalarial treatment. Therefore, generalised pruritus 
might be caused by antimalarial drugs that are different 
structurally from 4-AQs or else pruritus might occur in 
patients with malaria whether they are or are not treated 
with antimalarial drugs.
The decrease in haemoglobin concentration after 
treatment with artemether plus lumefantrine is consistent 
with reports of haemolysis after artesunate treatment for 
severe malaria,24 and suggests post-artemisinin haemolysis 
might also occur in patients with less severe 
(uncomplicated) malaria, although this finding was not 
significant after adjusting for multiple tests. On the basis 
of these observations, we suggest adding post-treatment 
haemolysis to the list of potential adverse events associated 
with artemisinins in uncomplicated malaria. By contrast, 
the decrease in haemoglobin concentration with AQ-13 
was consistent with the haemolysis typically reported in 
uncomplicated P falciparum malaria.26
Changes in visual acuity have been reported with 
chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, but usually only in 
patients treated for a decade or more.27 Likewise, 
arrhythmias and heart block have been reported with 
chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine,28 but typically only 
after massive intravenous overdoses administered 
rapidly rather than the low oral doses administered in 
our study. No ocular or cardiac adverse events were 
reported in either treatment group.
The more rapid parasite clearance time with artemether 
plus lumefantrine than with AQ-13 was expected because 
many studies have reported shorter clearance times with 
artemisinins.13 However, the shorter fever clearance 
times with AQ-13 than with artemether plus lumefantrine 
were not expected. These results suggest that fever 
clearance is not simply a secondary effect of parasite 
clearance. Additionally, the shorter fever clearance times 
with AQ-13 were consistent with reports that 4-AQs have 
antipyretic activity.22 Thus, the antipyretic activity of the 
4-AQs might be responsible for the shorter fever 
clearance times reported with AQ-13 despite the shorter 
parasite clearance times reported with artemether plus 
lumefantrine.
AQ-13 concentrations were 40–50 times greater than 
the IC50 for drug-resistant parasites, and were maintained 
in the blood for 8 days or more as asexual parasites were 
cleared without serious adverse events. Of note, the 
pharmaco 
kinetic parameters and blood concentrations 
of AQ-13 in this phase 2 study are similar to those 
observed in the phase 1 study of AQ-13 in New Orleans, 
LA, USA,9 which enrolled healthy men and women who 
did not have malaria or other acute illnesses. We did not 
detect a measurable prolongation of the QTc interval 
with AQ-13, despite the findings of the phase 1 study.9 
Because the AQ-13 blood concentrations were similar in 
our study and the phase 1 study,9 we postulate that AQ-13 
sequestered within infected red blood cells might not be 
free to affect the QT interval.
The data reported in our study indicate that the safety 
and efficacy of AQ-13 for uncomplicated malaria are

similar to those of artemether plus lumefantrine in 
Malian men aged 18 years or older. However, because 
semi-immune participants, such as those included in our 
study, might clear parasites resistant to the drugs being 
tested, additional studies in non-immune individuals, 
such as children,29 are needed before deciding whether to 
recommend the widespread use of aminoquinolines 
such as AQ-13. Other limitations of this study include the 
exclusion of women and the exclusion of individuals 
with severe or complicated malaria.
Because of increasing resistance to artemisinin 
combination therapies in southeast Asia, the efficacy 
of AQ-13 for uncomplicated malaria caused by 
chloroquine-resistant P falciparum and the activity of 
other aminoquinolines against chloroquine-resistant 
parasites7,8 suggest that 4-AQs with modified side 
chains could improve malaria control in sub-Saharan 
Africa, Latin America, and Oceania, and possibly in 
southeast Asia.
