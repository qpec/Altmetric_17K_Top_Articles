Recent evidence suggests that sexual contact may give rise to transmission of
Ebola virus long after infection has been cleared from blood. We develop a
simple mathematical model that incorporates contact transmission and
sexual transmission parametrized from data relating to the 2013–2015 West
African Ebola epidemic. The model explores scenarios where contact trans-
mission is reduced following infection events, capturing behaviour change,
and quantifies how these actions reducing transmission may be compromised
by sexual transmission in terms of increasing likelihood, size and duration of
outbreaks. We characterize the extent to which sexual transmission operates in
terms of the probability of initial infection resolving to sexual infectiousness
and the sexual transmission rate, and relate these parameters to the overall
case burden. We find that sexual transmission can have large effects on epi-
demic dynamics (increasing attack ratios from 25% in scenarios without
sexual transmission but with contact-transmission-reducing behaviour, up
to 80% in equivalent scenarios with sexual transmission).
1. Introduction
The recent Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa posed a global threat and came at
significant morbidity (approx. 30 000 cases) and mortality costs (case fatality rate
40–70%) [1,2]. Owing to the rapid and concerted local and international interven-
tion, focused on breaking the chain of direct transmission, the epidemic was
eventually brought under control. Recent evidence suggests that the virus can per-
sist in semen for several months [3] and genomic evidence has identified at least
one instance of sexual transmission from male to female [4]. Here, we use a math-
ematical model to study the extent to which sexual transmission may compromise
interventions and seed future epidemics. Our model comprised both direct-
contact and sexual transmission modes, parametrized using recent data on
Ebola virus transmission and shedding in semen. Uncertain parameters, such
as the probability of becoming sexually infectious, are varied through plausible
ranges and metrics of epidemic impact; specifically increase in outbreak size, dur-
ation and probability are attributed to the degree to which sexual transmission is
assumed to be in operation. We find that sexual transmission can dramatically
affect the course of the outbreak and that the probability of becoming sexually
infectious is a key parameter determining outbreak size.
2. Model and analysis
To parametrize the dynamics of the sexually infectious class, we used recently
published data from a convenience survey of men who recovered from Ebola

 virus infection during the 2013–2015 epidemic [3], which
suggested that virus can remain present in the semen for a
considerable time (figure 1).
The four-month lag before the probability of virus detec-
tion in semen drops below 100% suggests a gamma
distribution
rather
than
an
exponential
distribution
to
describe the probability of remaining sexually infectious
over time. Accordingly, we fitted the gamma probability
density function
ha
G ðaÞ ta�1e�ht
ð2:1Þ
to the data using maximum likelihood (details in the
electronic supplementary material).
We used the method of stages [5] to produce a gamma
distributed residence time in the sexually infectious class,
with mean duration t ¼ a=h and corresponding recovery
rate v ¼ 1=t. After fitting the model, we recast a to its nearest
integer and refitted h. The results of the fitting exercise show
that the optimal model contains a ¼ 5 sexually infectious
pseudo-stages with a pseudo-stage transition rate of 0.722
months21 (alternative plausible parametrizations, a ¼ 4,6, are
explored in the electronic supplementary material).
We developed a Susceptible-Infectious-Sexually Infectious-
Recovered (SIYR) model to describe the dynamics of the epi-
demic in a population of size N ðN ¼ S þ Iþ P5
j¼1 Yj þ RÞ.
Susceptible individuals (S) may transition to the symptomatic
infectious state (I) via two modes of virus transmission: direct-
or sexual contact with infectious (I and Y, respectively)
individuals. The parameter bC is the transmission rate for
infection that occurs through density-dependent direct-contact,
which is scaled by the function e�fI. Here f � 0 acts to reduce
direct-contact transmission when the number of cases is high,
reflecting behaviour and intervention changes that reduce
transmission (one of several ways to model outbreaks brought
under control). The parameter bS is the transmission rate of the
virus that occurs through frequency-dependent sexual contact.
Individuals transition out of the directly infectious class at rate
g, or die due to infection with probability c. After transitioning
from class I, a proportion of individuals (p) become sexually
infectious and transition through the five equally infectious
pseudo-stages, with pseudo-stage transition rate h. Individuals
who transition from the last pseudo-stage (Y5) or did not
become sexually infectious are then recovered (R) and are
immune to reinfection.

change (f ¼ 0) attack ratios are typically 80% in this model.
Parameter values are listed in table 1.
Because some parameters relating to sexual transmission
( p, bS) are uncertain, these were varied through plausible
ranges: bS [ f0, 0:05, . . . , 0:5g, p [ f0, 0:05, . . . , 0:5g with
maximum values increasing overall R0 up to 2.5. Baseline
epidemic metrics (probability, size and duration) in the
absence of sexual transmission are discerned by including
p ¼ 0 and bS ¼ 0 in simulations. Models were implemented
as stochastic simulations using Gillespie’s direct method
[8] to link parameter values with increases in average out-
break size, average duration of the outbreak and the
probability of an outbreak. Replication was at the scale of
1000 outbreaks per parameter set and each simulation
began
with
one
symptomatically
infectious
individual
(I0 ¼ 1), with all other individuals assumed susceptible.
Simulations ran until there were no infectious individuals
(I ¼ Y ¼ 0).
Probability of large outbreaks was established by seek-
ing
the
relative
size
of
the
second,
large
mode
for
outbreak sizes from the appropriate histogram [9]. For
each parameter set a histogram of the size of outbreaks
was generated (breaks occurring at every 50 individuals).
All sets exhibited a U-shaped distribution, from which we
found the outbreak size that separated the two modes of
the distribution (local minimum of the distribution func-
tion).
Additionally,
extinction
time
(time
until
last
infectious individual, I or Y, recovers) and size were calcu-
lated only from the set of large outbreaks (i.e. conditional
on a large outbreak occurring).
3. Results
The average outbreak size, extinction time and outbreak
probability increased with sexual transmission rate, bS, and
the proportion of individuals that become sexually infectious,
p
(figure
2).
When
there
is
no
sexual
transmission
(p ¼ 0, bS ¼ 0), outbreak size and outbreak probability are at
their minimum. Extinction time is shortest for p ¼ 0, and only
longer for bS ¼ 0, p . 0 because individuals can enter the sexu-
ally infectious phase (Y) without transmitting, and extinction
time is measured as the time they recover from class Y.
The three panels A, B, and C in figure 2 are example out-
breaks that occur with each denoted parameter pairing.
When both bS and p are small (A), outbreaks that occur
have lower sizes and happen over a shorter time. Intermedi-
ate values of bS and p (B), result in slightly longer outbreak
duration with larger sizes. With the largest values of bS
and p (C), the outbreaks have similar duration to those associ-
ated with (B) and have the largest outbreak sizes. In each
example, the direct-contact chain breaks (red curves showing
incidence of symptomatic cases at 0) and is rescued by
sexually infectious individuals.

 4. Discussion
Adding sexual transmission to a direct-transmission com-
partment model increases parasite fitness by augmenting
the possible ways in which the parasite may achieve
onward transmission. The parasite basic reproductive ratio
is the sum of the direct and sexual transmission basic repro-
ductive ratios, similar to the sum of direct and environmental
transmission ratios derived for avian influenza viruses [10]
and waterborne pathogens [11]. The degree to which sexual
transmission compromises mitigation of an outbreak that is
waning due to behaviour change reducing direct-contact
transmission depends on the probability that regular infec-
tions resolve to a sexually infectious state, the duration of
that state and the sexual transmission rate. The inclusion of
sexual transmission increases the probability of outbreaks
occurring partly by repairing broken transmission chains,
which augments the reproductive ratio used in the stochastic
threshold theorem for epidemic probability derived using a
birth–death model [12].
The study explores the possibility that Ebola virus
outbreaks could be reignited by sexual transmission post-
convalescence. Our model provides a way to evaluate the
extent to which this transmission mode may increase out-
break size and duration, as well as its ability to repair
broken, or stuttering, direct-transmission chains. The prob-
ability that individuals become sexually infectious is key to
this process and is a relatively unknown parameter. The
ongoing advice and counselling to Ebola survivors aimed
at preventing sexual transmission [13], when translated to a
reduced probability of being sexually infectious, could have
a striking impact even if it is hard to measure in practice.
The aim of the model presented is to provide a timely,
broad perspective on the potential role of sexual transmission
and
an
appreciation
of
which
controllable
parameters
have the largest effect on outbreaks. Available data [3] were
invaluable
in
enabling
the
model
to
describe
non-
exponentially distributed residence times in the sexually
infectious class. Future data sources are likely to further
improve on basic compartment models, such as data on the
disproportionate role that individuals may play based on
partner exchange rates [14], and the network structure of
sexual contacts [15]. These enhancements may ultimately
refine predictions on the role of sexual transmission in
otherwise direct-contact contagious processes like Ebola.
