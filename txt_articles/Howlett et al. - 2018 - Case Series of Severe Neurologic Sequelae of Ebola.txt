 We describe a case series of 35 Ebola virus disease (EVD) 
survivors during the epidemic in West Africa who had neu-
rologic and accompanying psychiatric sequelae. Survivors 
meeting neurologic criteria were invited from a cohort of 361 
EVD survivors to attend a preliminary clinic. Those whose 
severe neurologic features were documented in the prelimi-
nary clinic were referred for specialist neurologic evaluation, 
ophthalmologic examination, and psychiatric assessment. 
Of 35 survivors with neurologic sequelae, 13 had migraine 
headache, 2 stroke, 2 peripheral sensory neuropathy, and 
2 peripheral nerve lesions. Of brain computed tomography 
scans of 17 patients, 3 showed cerebral and/or cerebel-
lar atrophy and 2 confirmed strokes. Sixteen patients re-
quired mental health follow-up; psychiatric disorders were 
diagnosed in 5. The 10 patients who experienced greatest 
disability had co-existing physical and mental health condi-
tions. EVD survivors may have ongoing central and periph-
eral nervous system disorders, including previously unrec-
ognized migraine headaches and stroke.
T
he 2014–2016 West Africa Ebola virus disease (EVD) 
epidemic resulted in an estimated 3,956 deaths and 
10,168 survivors in Sierra Leone (1). The use of high- 
quality specialty services by Ebola survivors offers an op-
portunity to improve understanding of debilitating post-
EVD sequelae.
Central nervous system (CNS) viral invasion by EVD 
had been suspected but unproven until the West Africa EVD 
epidemic. In this outbreak, individual case-patient reports 
describe clinical features of meningoencephalitis or menin-
gitis during and after acute Ebola virus (EBOV) infection, 
accompanied by EBOV PCR results in nonbloodstained ce-
rebrospinal fluid samples (CSF) (2–6). Cranial imaging of 
3 encephalitic patients documented changes consistent with 
cerebral atrophy (3), meningoencephalitis (4), and areas of 
diffusion restriction suggesting ischemia (4,5). Nonhuman 
primate EVD models and human Marburg neuropathology 
found EBOV-immunoreactive glial nodules and perivascu-
lar infiltrates (7–9) and evidence of choriomeningioenceph-
alitis (10). In addition, a novel retinal lesion in Ebola survi-
vors that appears to follow ganglion cell axons as they exit 
the optic nerve has been described (11). Combined with the 
observation that human CSF can be EBOV PCR–positive 
after plasma testing shows negative results (3,4), these ob-
servations raise the possibility that infected CNS cells may 
have a role in persistent or recurrent neurologic disease.
Observational studies of survivors report a broad 
range of neuropsychiatric symptoms (12–14), including 
increased fatigue, diminished work capacity, and sleep dis-
turbance (15,16). Psychosocial distress caused by bereave-
ment, stress, and stigma and formal psychiatric diagnoses 
of depression, anxiety, and adjustment disorder have been 
reported (17–21).
To define the full spectrum of characteristics and 
severity of neurologic and psychiatric disease, we inves-
tigated neurologic sequelae in patients with neurologic 
symptoms by providing specialist neurologic evaluation, 
psychiatric and disability assessment, and brain computed 
tomography (CT) imaging and retinal imaging to an EVD 
survivor cohort. Our additional objective was to describe 
psychiatric, disability, and ophthalmic outcomes for survi-
vors with neurologic sequelae.

 Neurologic Sequelae of Ebola Virus Disease
Materials and Methods
We completed this prospective observational study during 
February 4–May 10, 2016. Patients eligible for inclusion 
were >12 years of age, had complete clinical records, and 
attended the 34 Military Hospital (34MH) Ebola Survivors 
Clinic, Freetown, Sierra Leone. All patients provided Eb-
ola survivor discharge certificates as proof of identity at 
initial enrolment in the 34MH cohort and on attending the 
preliminary clinic. Furthermore, staff at the 34MH clinic 
had provided care in the 34MH emergency treatment unit 
(ETU) and could certify the validity of survivors. The pre-
liminary clinic took place at the 34MH Ebola Survivors 
Clinic and the specialist clinics at Connaught Hospital, 
Freetown, Sierra Leone.
Patients were invited to the preliminary clinic on the 
basis of having reported >1 major or >2 minor criteria (Ta-
ble 1). These criteria were selected to maximize sensitiv-
ity for neurologic and psychiatric conditions. In addition, 
clinic staff invited additional patients suspected of having 
neurologic symptoms.
In the preliminary clinic, an intern physician, supported 
by trained nursing staff, obtained informed written consent to 
publish clinical data and images and administered an initial 
questionnaire. Further history and examination, including 
full neurologic examination, were accomplished by 2 phy-
sicians who used structured data recording forms. Patients 
with prominent or disabling symptoms of neurologic origin 
that required referral to the joint neurologic and psychiatric 
clinic were defined as having severe neurologic features. Pa-
tients with neurologic sequelae who did not warrant referral 
became a no severe neurologic features group. Laboratory 
tests, including lumbar puncture and brain CT, were avail-
able according to clinical need. Patients who had >2 psy-
chiatric symptoms were referred for psychiatric assessment.
In the specialist clinic, full neurologic history and ex-
amination were performed individually or jointly by 2 con-
sultant neurologists. Psychiatric assessment was performed 
onsite by 2 higher-level psychiatry trainees. Psychiatric 
assessment included Mini International Neuropsychiatric 
Interview (MINI-plus) and Mini Mental State Examination 
(MMSE; Mapi Research Trust PROVIDE, Lyon, France) 
and the World Health Organization Disability Assess-
ment Schedule 2.0 (WHO-DAS 2.0; http://www.who.int/
classifications/icf/whodasii/en/). The WHO-DAS 2.0 is a 
cross-cultural and validated tool providing a score that is 
compared to population percentile values (22). Although 
no cognitive or psychiatric assessment tools have been val-
idated for the Sierra Leone population, the MMSE is fre-
quently used by staff in the Connaught mental health clinic. 
Patient follow-up occurred at a second neurology clinic, in 
their local mental health clinic, and by telephone.
Patients underwent enhanced axial CT imaging of 
 
the brain, and scans were reviewed by a consultant 
 
neuroradiologist by using Mango software (http://ric.uthsc-
sa.edu/mango/). All patients reviewed by specialists were 
invited for ophthalmologic examination, including retinal 
imaging. Images were reported by ophthalmologists.
Statistical Analysis
We collected data on paper forms structured for clinical 
use, entered it into Microsoft Excel 2011 (Microsoft, Red-
mond, WA, USA), and edited it for missing information. 
We analyzed data by using Stata version 14.0 (StataCorp 
LLC, College Station, TX, USA). For sample sizes ≥35, 
we calculated 95% CIs for proportions by using an exact 
binomial method. Unadjusted odds ratios were calculated 
for binary and ordinal variables. We used the Wilcoxon 
rank sum test for comparison of continuous data and the 
Fisher exact test for categorical data. For multivariable lo-
gistic regression of factors associated with attending or not 
attending the preliminary clinic, we used a predetermined 
model with age (linear term), sex, and presence of major or 
minor criteria as explanatory variables. EBOV PCR cycle 
threshold (Ct) (a figure inversely representative of plasma 
viral load, with >40 cycles used as a negative cutoff value) 
was not included in the regression models because different 
laboratories used different thresholds.
This study was reviewed in accordance with Univer-
sity of Liverpool human subjects review procedures and 
determined to be a nonresearch public health response ac-
tivity. Ethics approval was confirmed in writing from the 
Sierra Leone Ethics and Scientific Review Committee. All 
data collection instruments were stored in a secured loca-
tion, accessible only by study staff. Personal identifiers 
were removed from the database before analysis.
Results
Of 361 patients, 5 patients were excluded because clini-
cal data were incomplete and 22 because they were <12 
years of age. Of the 334 included patients, 161 (49.7%,

 SYNOPSIS
95% CI 44.1%–55.3%) were female and 163 (50.3%, 95% 
CI 44.7%–55.9%) male; sex was not recorded for 10 pa-
tients. Median patient age was 28 (IQR 23.0–37.0) years. 
A total of 111 (33.2%, 95% CI 28.2%–38.6%) patients 
were eligible for the preliminary clinic; 32 (9.6%, 95% CI 
6.6%–13.3%) patients had 1 major criteria, 74 (22.2%, CI 
95% 17.8%–27.0%) had >2 minor criteria, and 12 (3.3%, 
95% CI 1.7%–5.8%) were referred by clinic staff. A to-
tal of 40 (12.0%, 95% CI 8.7%–15.9%) patients attended 
the clinic (Figure 1). Among the 334 patients evaluated, 
the most common symptoms were headache (167, 50.0%, 
95% CI 44.5%–55.5%), loss of appetite (33, 9.9%, 95% CI 
6.9%–13.6%), and generalized weakness (22, 6.6%, 95% 
CI 4.2%–9.8%) (Figure 2). Female patients were more 
likely to be invited to the preliminary clinic than were male 
patients (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.22–3.32; p = 0.03) (online 
Technical Appendix Table 1, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/
article/24/8/17-1367-Techapp1.pdf). In those invited to the 
preliminary clinic, on multivariable analysis, the presence 
of minor criteria was associated with nonattendance (OR 
0.10, 95% CI 0.03–0.56; p = 0.005) (online Technical Ap-
pendix Table 2).
Of the 40 patients attending the preliminary clinic, 26 
(65%, 95% CI 48.3%–79.3%) were female, and the median 
age was 32 (IQR 25–43) years. Patients were seen in the 
clinic a median of 430 (IQR 401–473) days after the first 
positive diagnostic results. At the time of preliminary clinic, 
35 (87.5%, 95% CI 73.2%–95.8%) had neurologic or psy-
chiatric symptoms (Table 2). None reported any substantial 
medical history of neurologic or mental health disorder. Of 
the 40 patients, 19 (47.5%, 95% CI 31.5%–63.9%) were de-
fined as having severe neurologic signs and symptoms and 
were offered referral to the joint neurologic and psychiatric 
clinic, brain CT, and retinal imaging. An additional 5 pa-
tients were referred for psychiatric review only. We found no 
significant difference in demographic or acute EVD features 
between patients with and without severe neurologic fea-
tures (Table 3). A greater proportion of patients with severe

neurologic symptoms were unconscious during any point in 
admission to the ETU, but this association was weak (OR 
3.32, 95% CI 0.79–15.40; p = 0.11). Due to data sparsity, 
multivariable analysis was not performed.
Clinical Features
In the preliminary clinic, a new or different headache since 
acute EVD admission was reported by 30 (75.0%, 95% CI 
58.8%–87.3%) patients; female:male ratio was 2:1. Of those 
with headache, 14 (46.6%, 95% CI 38.3%–65.7%) had un-
differentiated headache, 13 (43.3%, 95% CI 25.5%–62.6%) 
migraine, and 3 (10.0%, 95% CI 2.1%–26.5%) tension-
type headaches (online Technical Appendix Table 3). Five 
patients who had migraine headaches were prescribed oral 
propranolol (20 mg 1×/d), in keeping with WHO guidance 
on survivor care (23); 4 returned for follow-up 1 month af-
ter treatment and reported symptomatic improvement.
One male and 1 female survivor, both 42 years of age, 
had evidence of stroke; symptom onset occurred at the time 
of acute EVD. These patients had the highest disability 
scores (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 scores 
89.58 and 33.33, respectively) and met criteria for a mental 
health disorder (see Case Study 1). Given the major vessel 
territory distribution on CT, these strokes are suspected to 
be mature ischemic infarcts.
Two survivors had peripheral sensory neuropathy and 
2 focal peripheral nerve lesions. Brachial plexopathy was 
diagnosed in a 27-year-old woman during acute EVD. Neu-
ropathy screening of the patient for treatable causes was 
negative, and she was referred for physiotherapy. Asym-
metric glove and stocking peripheral sensory neuropathy 
was diagnosed in a 35-year-old man, occurring since ETU 
discharge. Diabetes and major depressive disorder were 
 
diagnosed, and he was referred to the diabetes and mental 
health clinic. Other reported neurologic symptoms in the 
cohort included 3 cases of tinnitus, 2 cases of tremor, and 
1 case of asymmetric lower limb atrophy with weakness 
of unknown etiology. Of the 19 patients who attended the 
specialist clinic, 12 were reviewed 1 year later, in June 
2017; 10 reported improvement of symptoms, 1 reported 
no changes, and 1 reported a new headache. After this, 
case-study patient 1 died.
Psychiatric symptoms were common among 21 
(52.5%, 95% CI 36.1%–68.4%) survivors describing dif-
ficulty sleeping; 12 (30.0%, 95% CI 16.5%–46.5%) de-
scribed depressive symptoms and 11/40 (27.5%, 95% CI 
14.6%–43.9%) anxiety symptoms (online Technical Ap-
pendix Table 4). Of 24 (60.0%, 95% CI 43.3%–75.1%) sur-
vivors referred for psychiatric review, 19 (47.5%, 95% CI 
31.5–63.8%) attended the clinic. Of those, 16 (63.3%) re-
quired referral for local mental health follow-up, of whom 
5 met criteria for mental disorder (2 generalized anxiety 
disorder; and 3 major depressive disorder). The most com-
mon reasons for mental health referral were stigma, grief, 
and loss of employment. Of the 19 patients who attended 
the psychiatric clinic, median MMSE score was 93.3% 
(IQR 87.7%–96.3%). No patient reported suicidal ideation.
Among 19 survivors assessed for disability, the me-
dian WHO-DAS 2.0 score was 8.3% (IQR 3.1%–13.5%) 
corresponding to the 69th percentile of the normative popu-
lation. The 9 patients who had a disability score >10 (cor-
responding to scores found in <27.65% of the normative 
population) included all survivors affected by mental health 
disorders, stroke, and peripheral neuropathies for which 
disabilities were assessed. The most severe case of disabil-
ity is described in Case Study 2.

 SYNOPSIS
Of 17 patients who underwent brain CT, abnormalities 
were shown for 7. Three scans showed evidence of cere-
bral or cerebellar atrophy that was atypical for patient age 
(Figure 3, panel A), 2 confirmed the clinical assessment 
of stroke (Figure 3, panel B), and 2 showed evidence of 
calcification, differentials of which include previous focal 
hemorrhage occurring >1 year before the scan.
Of the 40 survivors evaluated at the prelimnary clin-
ic, 12 described eye pain (30.0%, 95% CI 16.6%–46.5%)

visual loss. Of 17 patients who attended the ophthalmology 
 
specialist clinic for examination, and wide field-scanning 
laser ophthalmoscope imaging, 3 (17.6%) had Ebola retinal 
lesions (Figure 3, panels C, D) (11). One survivor had unilat-
eral retinal detachment, 1 intermediate uveitis, and 1 poste-
rior subcapsular cataract suggestive of previous uveitis.
Case Studies
Case Study 1—Patient No. 25
Patient no. 25 was a previously fit and well 41-year-old 
male soldier who had an uncomplicated 8-day acute ad-
mission to a hospital for treatment of EVD; 3 days after 
discharge, he had sudden onset of left-sided weakness and 
dysphasia. In the neurology clinic, 545 days after his ad-
mission for acute illness, examination was consistent with 
a right upper motor neuron lesion. His MMSE was 26/27 
and WHO-DAS 2.0 score 89.58, conforming to significant 
disability. He exhibited a pervasive low mood, anhedonia, 
feelings of worthlessness, guilt, frustration, and hopeless-
ness regarding the future because of disability. His CT 
results showed extensive gliosis within the left middle 
cerebral artery territory, in keeping with mature infarct 
(Figure 3, panel B.). Retinal imaging showed bilateral 
Ebola retinal lesions (Figure 3, panels C, D). Stroke and 
major depressive disorder were diagnosed. He was referred 
for physiotherapy, which resulted in marked improvement 
in symptoms, and received mental health clinic follow-up. 
Approximately 1 year after the intial clinic visit, the patient 
had an undifferentiated fever; serum from a blood sample 
tested EBOV PCR negative, but he died several days later.
Case Study 2—Patient No. 37
A 12-year-old girl who had a normal developmental history 
had a Ct of 27.9 at hospital admission for EVD; she improved 
with treatment and became serum EBOV PCR negative on 
days 15 and 17. On day 20, her consciousness level gradu-
ally declined and fever recurred; she then had recurrent sei-
zures for 48 hours that were partially controlled by adminis-
tration of phenytoin and diazepam. Her consciousness level 
gradually improved over the next 4 weeks to spontaneously 
alert but confused. At the preliminary clinic, 454 days after 
acute admission, she was blind and had substantial hearing 
loss and severe cognitive impairment. She was doubly in-
continent and required 24-hour care for all activities of daily 
living. Her CT results showed disproportionate parietal and 
temporal lobe atrophy (Figure 3, panel C). CSF test results 
were EBOV negative; results of a specialist’s ophthalmol-
ogy review were unremarkable. Planning for her complex 
care needs required multiagency and multidisciplinary co-
ordination to find an orphanage and provide resources and 
training to that facility to help manage her needs. She was 
unable to attend the specialist neurology clinic because of 
the remote location of her orphanage. Follow-up visits to the 
orphanage from the medical, psychiatric, and therapies team 
found no major functional improvements.
Discussion
Previous studies have outlined the frequency of a variety of 
neurologic symptoms in EVD survivors (13). Our specialist 
case series from the 34MH survivor’s cohort confirms the 
presence of central and peripheral nervous system disor-
ders and found these to be associated with a broad range of 
disability. The most frequent neurologic diagnosis was mi-
graine headaches; the next most common, respectively, were 
stroke, peripheral sensory neuropathy, and focal peripheral 
nerve lesions. Most survivors had co-occurring mental health 
problems, the most frequent psychiatric diagnoses being ma-
jor depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. The 
most severely affected patients had symptoms of blindness, 
deafness, focal weakness, and cognitive dysfunction associ-
ated with disability and mental illness.
The diagnosis of migraine headache found in 13 case-
patients was characterized by intermittent, throbbing head-
aches associated with photophobia, phonophobia, and, in 
some cases, vomiting. These symptoms were either new 
or substantially worse after acute EVD. In a small group, 
treatment with propranolol  according to WHO guide-
lines (23) led to subjective improvement. To date, head-
aches in the EVD survivor population have not been well

 SYNOPSIS
described; a small group of survivors was noted to have uni-
lateral and throbbing headaches (19), although frequency 
from the 2014–2016 West Africa Ebola disease outbreak 
ranges 22%–68% (14,19,20,25), In the only case–control 
study in which 90% of survivors reported headache, a 
high prevalence of 75% in the control population meant 
this finding was not significant (16). A recent meta-anal-
ysis reported a community migraine prevalence of 5.6% 
(95% CI 4.6%–6.7%) in community-based studies in Af-
rica (26). Because our preliminary clinic selection crite-
ria required patients with headache to have >1 associated 
 
symptom, our headache findings and prevalence may not be 
 
representative of the survivor population. Potential mech-
anisms for migraine headache in EVD survivors may 
include autonomic dysregulation (27), changes in tryp-
tophan-serotonin levels after infection (28), or ongoing 
neuroinflammation, as seen in HIV infection (29). With 
limited diagnostic methods, we are unable to determine 
specific etiologies of all neuropathy or suspected my-
opathy cases; however, diabetic neuropathy, entrapment 
neuropathy, or critical illness polyneuropathy with slow 
recovery are potential causes.

Patient no. 25, male, age 42. CT 
of brain shows extensive gliosis 
within the left middle cerebral 
artery territory reflecting an old 
infarct with ex-vacuo dilatation 
of left lateral ventricle due to 
hemispheric volume loss. C) 
Patient no. 12, age 40. Retinal 
imaging shows right and left 
eye, with extensive bilateral 
peripapillary pale retinal lesions 
and pigmentation of larger 
lesions. Lesions appear to 
spare the fovea. Visual acuity 
was 20/25 (right) and 20/20 
(left) (24). D) Patient no. 25, 
male, age 42. Retinal imaging 
shows right and left eye, with 
peripapillary pale retinal lesions. 
Visual acuity was 20/25 in both 
eyes (24). 
 Neurologic Sequelae of Ebola Virus Disease
Diagnostic imaging showed sequelae of focal or gen-
eralized atrophy or stroke in some patients. As previously 
reported (5,12), we found substantial cerebral atrophy in 2 
patients and isolated cerebellar atrophy in 1 other survivor. 
One patient had a reported case of late onset encephalitis (3), 
and 1 patient’s imaging correlated with substantial cognitive 
deficit, cortical blindness, and hearing impairment (see Case 
Study 2). Although it is possible the atrophy was related to 
birth complications, nutritional deficiency, or childhood ill-
ness, the prominent parietal and temporal lobe atrophy of this 
adolescent case-patient resembles radiologic findings in sub-
acute sclerosing panencephalitis, a chronic CNS infection 
caused by defective measles virus, raising the possibility of 
similar CNS mechanisms of EVD and measles or persistent 
CNS infection (30). Cerebral CT images of 2 stroke case-
patients, whose neurologic symptom onset occurred during 
acute EVD, were consistent with ischemic stroke. Suspected 
stroke during acute EVD has been reported (31), and throm-
boelastography, a measurement of thrombotic tendency, 
done during and after acute EVD illness, suggests a pro-
thrombotic period in the immediate aftermath of EVD (32).
In 3 (15.8%) of 19 patients in the severe neurologic 
features group, we observed the novel Ebola peripapillary 
retinal lesion, recently reported by Steptoe et al. (11), who 
described a similar prevalence (14.6%) among a wider sur-
vivor population. Although the most likely mechanism of 
CNS viral entry is from circulating infected cells, the pres-
ence of retinal peripapillary lesions, thought to represent 
virus spread along the retinal nerve fiber or ganglion cell 
axon layers, raises the possibility of CNS viral entry by 
neuronal spread.
The group of patients who had severe neurologic fea-
tures generally had good results from adapted MMSE testing. 
For a patient who had a confirmed case of late-stage EVD 
encephalitis and initial neurocognitive impairment (3), as-
sessment 1 year later showed good long-term recovery. This 
finding is encouraging and in keeping with 2 case reports 
of recovery from neurocognitive impairment (33). Despite 
onset being 1 year after acute disease and many patients hav-
ing been initially referred to counselors, 5 of 19 patients met 
criteria for psychiatric disorder, all 19 had concurrent physi-
cal symptoms, and 16 required mental health follow-up. As 
previously reported, survivors cited stigma, grief, and loss of 
employment as major stressors impeding recovery (17,34).
A recent case–control study found survivors had major 
limitations of vision, cognition, affect, and, most markedly, 
mobility (35). In our study, we found 10 participants who re-
ported high levels of disability and also had physical symp-
toms and co-occurring mental health issues. This clustering 
of physical and psychiatric sequelae and disability suggests 
a subset of patients most affected after acute EVD and with 
the greatest care needs. In the small number of self-selecting 
case-patients on whom we followed up 18 months after the 
first neurologic/psychiatric clinic, patients generally report-
ed symptomatic improvement; however, improvement was 
not uniform. One case-patient subsequently died (patient no. 
25; see Case Study 1) and another remains dependent for all 
activities of daily living (patient no. 37; see Case Study 2).
Our study observed no association between severe 
neurologic conditions and admission Ct. To the contrary, 
among the 2 patients who had both prolonged periods of 
unconsciousness and cerebral atrophy on CT (patients no. 
2 and 16), the neurologic episodes occurred late in the acute 
disease period, not at the time of peak viral load. Similarly, 
2 case reports describe a prolonged meningoencephalitic 
stage of disease or meningoencephalitis occurring months 
after recovery (4,5). Of note, we found no cases of CNS 
infection recurrence. Unconsciousness during acute ad-
mission was more common among those who had severe 
neurologic symptoms on follow-up, although not to a sig-
nificant degree, possibly caused by limited sample size 
(OR 3.32, CI 0.79–15.4; p = 0.11). Our preliminary group 
was selected on the basis of existing neurologic symptoms, 
which precludes a conclusion of causation and generaliza-
tion to the wider EVD survivor population.
A major limitation of our case series is that we cannot 
firmly determine causation between our findings and the di-
agnosis of EVD beyond the temporal association. Further-
more, in keeping with other observational studies, a lack of 
reliable countrywide denominator data on conditions such as 
headache or stroke means we cannot assess the representa-
tiveness of our results. Validating our findings would require 
a large case–control study, in which our data could be used as 
a basis for study design. Retrospectively asking about acute 
symptoms incurs the possibility of recall bias; however, as 
acute records of the EBV outbreak clinics are sparse and link-
age-challenging, this represented the most viable option. De-
spite our multiple attempts, the outcomes of 71/111 patients 
who were invited to but did not attend the preliminary clinic 
remain unknown. Although our analysis shows those with 
minor selection criteria were among those less likely to attend 
(p = 0.005), it is still possible we underrepresented patients 
who had more disabling conditions and were unable to access 
the service, as exemplified by the patient in Case Study 2. 
Further research should focus on a complete characterization 
of pathways of sequelae and persistent infection (36).
Our case series, supported by brain CT imaging, con-
firms there are long-term neurologic sequelae in EVD sur-
vivors and a substantial proportion of these patients have 
ongoing mental health problems and disability. Often, 
these issues cluster together, and services should therefore 
seek out and support patients with a high burden of illness. 
If we wish to expand specialist services to the remaining 
EVD survivors and broader population, the only credible 
and sustainable option is to greatly increase support for in-
country specialist training of doctors.

EID SPOTLIGHT 
TOPIC
HIV-AIDS
HIV is a virus spread through certain body 
 
fluids that attacks the body’s immune sys-
tem—specifically the CD4 cells, often called T 
cells. These special cells help the immune sys-
tem fight off infections. Untreated, HIV reduces 
the number of CD4 cells (T cells) in the body. 
Over time, HIV can destroy so many of these 
cells that the body can’t fight off infections and 
disease. This damage to the immune system 
makes it harder and harder for the body to fight 
off infections and some other diseases. Oppor-
tunistic infections or cancers take advantage of 
a very weak immune system and signal that the 
person has AIDS.
